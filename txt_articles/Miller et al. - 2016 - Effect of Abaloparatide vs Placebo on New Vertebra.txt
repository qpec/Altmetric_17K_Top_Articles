IMPORTANCE Additional therapies are needed for prevention of osteoporotic fractures.
Abaloparatide is a selective activator of the parathyroid hormone type 1 receptor.
OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy and safety of abaloparatide, 80 μg, vs placebo for
prevention of new vertebral fracture in postmenopausal women at risk of osteoporotic fracture.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Abaloparatide Comparator Trial In Vertebral
Endpoints (ACTIVE) was a phase 3, double-blind, RCT (March 2011-October 2014) at 28 sites in
10 countries. Postmenopausal women with bone mineral density (BMD) T score �−2.5 and
>−5.0 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck and radiological evidence �2 mild or �1 moderate
lumbar or thoracic vertebral fracture or history of low-trauma nonvertebral fracture within the
past 5 years were eligible. Postmenopausal women (>65 y) with fracture criteria and a T score
�−2.0 and >−5.0 or without fracture criteria and a T score �−3.0 and >−5.0 could enroll.
INTERVENTIONS Blinded, daily subcutaneous injections of placebo (n = 821); abaloparatide,
80 μg (n = 824); or open-label teriparatide, 20 μg (n = 818) for 18 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary end point was percentage of participants with new
vertebral fracture in the abaloparatide vs placebo groups. Sample size was set to detect a 4%
difference (57% risk reduction) between treatment groups. Secondary end points included
change in BMD at total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine in abaloparatide-treated vs
placebo participants and time to first incident nonvertebral fracture. Hypercalcemia was a
prespecified safety end point in abaloparatide-treated vs teriparatide participants.
RESULTS Among 2463 women (mean age, 69 years [range, 49-86]), 1901 completed the
study. New morphometric vertebral fractures occurred less frequently in the active treatment
groups vs placebo. The Kaplan-Meier estimated event rate for nonvertebral fracture was
lower with abaloparatide vs placebo. BMD increases were greater with abaloparatide than
placebo (all P < .001). Incidence of hypercalcemia was lower with abaloparatide (3.4%)
vs teriparatide (6.4%) (risk difference [RD], −2.96 [95% CI, −5.12 to −0.87]; P = .006).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, the use
of subcutaneous abaloparatide, compared with placebo, reduced the risk of new vertebral
and nonvertebral fractures over 18 months. Further research is needed to understand the
clinical importance of RD, the risks and benefits of abaloparatide treatment, and the efficacy
of abaloparatide vs other osteoporosis treatments.

O
steoporosis is associated with substantial social, eco-
nomic, and public health burdens. Based on 2010 US
Census data, Wright et al1 estimated the prevalence
of osteoporosis among women aged 50 to 69 years at 3.4 mil-
lion. Another 18.8 million US women in that age group were
estimated to have low bone mass at the femoral neck or lum-
bar spine. Additionally, Cawthon et al2 have estimated that
the lifetime risk of osteoporotic fracture for a 60-year-old
woman is 44%. Fractures are associated with decreased qual-
ity of life,3 including reduced independence,4 and osteopo-
rotic fractures5,6 are associated with increased morbidity and
mortality.7
Experiencing a major osteoporotic fracture increases the
risk of subsequent fractures,8,9 and risk is highest in the first
few years after the fracture.10-12 Osteoanabolic therapy is of-
ten recommended for women at risk of future fracture, in-
cluding those with recent fracture or with multiple fractures,13
but evidence of rapid fracture protection is lacking.14
Abaloparatide is a peptide that selectively binds to the RG
conformation of the parathyroid hormone type 1 receptor.15 As
a result of its mechanism of action, it was hypothesized that
abaloparatide would have a more pronounced anabolic ac-
tion on bone compared with teriparatide.
The primary objective of this study was to determine the
efficacyandadverseeventsofsubcutaneousabaloparatideuse
compared with placebo for prevention of new vertebral frac-
ture in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.
Methods
Study Design
The Abaloparatide Comparator Trial In Vertebral Endpoints
(ACTIVE) was an international, randomized, placebo- and
active-controlled trial including postmenopausal women
with osteoporosis. Women were randomized 1:1:1 to receive
daily subcutaneous injections of abaloparatide, 80 μg, or
matching placebo,or teriparatide, 20 μg. Abaloparatide and
matching placebo were administered using a double-blind
format, while teriparatide, because it could be administered
only via its trademarked injection pen, was given open label.
The treatment period was 18 months.
Study Participants
Postmenopausal women aged 49 to 86 years were eligible if
they had bone mineral density (BMD) by dual energy x-ray ab-
sorptiometry T score of less than or equal to −2.5 and greater
than −5.0 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck together with
radiologic evidence of at least 2 mild vertebral fractures or at
least 1 moderate vertebral fracture16 or history of a low-
trauma fracture of the forearm, humerus, sacrum, pelvis, hip,
femur, or tibia within the past 5 years. Women older than 65
years who met fracture criteria but had a T score of less than
or equal to −2.0 and greater than −5.0 were eligible. Women
older than 65 years were eligible without fracture criteria if
either BMD T score was less than or equal to −3.0 and greater
than −5.0. Eligibility required normal serum values for cal-
cium, intact parathyroid hormone, phosphorus, and alkaline
phosphatase and a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of greater than
15 ng/mL (37.5 nmol/L [SI conversion, multiply by 2.496]).
Women were excluded if they had more than 4 mild, moder-
ate, or any severe vertebral fractures (consistent with defini-
tions described by Genant et al16), fewer than 2 evaluable
lumbar vertebrae, or if hip BMD was unevaluable. Partici-
pants were ineligible if they had evidence of metabolic bone
disease or malabsorption or were taking any medications that
would interfere with bone metabolism. Women were also
excluded if they used bisphosphonates for more than 3
months in the past 5 years or denosumab within the past
year. Women with a history of osteosarcoma were also
excluded. (See the ACTIVE Trial Protocol in Supplement 1 for
full inclusion and exclusion criteria.)
Participants provided written informed consent, and
the protocol was approved by the respective institutional
review boards.
Randomization and Blinding
Between April 26, 2011, and March 11, 2013, participants were
randomized using a permuted-blocks design with a block size
of 6 in a ratio of 1:1:1 to 1 of the 3 treatment groups. Random-
ized distribution of participants to study groups was double-
blind. Abaloparatide and placebo were administered with
identical pen injector devices under identical storage and dis-
pensing conditions. Because the teriparatide device is a
trademarked pen, it could not be reproduced, and the drug is
not approved for dispensing from a different injection device
(eg, a syringe) to blind it. After opening the identical assigned
study medication kit after randomization on day 1, it became
apparent to investigators and patients whether open-label
teriparatide or either double-blind abaloparatide or double-
blind placebo had been assigned.
Efficacy End Points
The primary efficacy end point of this study was the percent-
age of participants with 1 or more incidents of new morpho-
metric vertebral fracture. Anteroposterior and lateral radio-
graphs of the lumbar and thoracic spine were obtained
at baseline and at the end of treatment. Radiologists
(Bioclinica-Synarc) graded each woman’
s vertebrae according
to the semiquantitative technique of Genant et al16 which
Key Points
Question Is abaloparatide effective compared with placebo and
teriparatide when used as a treatment to reduce the risk of new
vertebral and nonvertebral fractures?
Findings This double-blind randomized clinical trial including
2463 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis showed that
abaloparatide was associated with significantly greater reduction
in incidence of new vertebral fractures and nonvertebral fractures
compared with placebo. Hypercalcemia was less frequent with
abaloparatide than with teriparatide.
Meaning Abaloparatide may represent a meaningful treatment
option for postmenopausal women who have osteoporosis but
requires testing against other osteoporosis treatments.

defines a decrease in height of 20% to 25% as mild, 26% to
40% as moderate, and more than 40% as severe. Treatment
was blinded from radiologists. A second radiologist reviewed
radiographs in which an incident fracture had been identified
to confirm the reading; if necessary, a third radiologist adju-
dicated the incident fracture. All treatments were blinded
from adjudicators.
Nonvertebral fractures (a secondary end point) were frac-
tures that excluded those of the spine, sternum, patella, toes,
fingers, skull, and face and those with high trauma, defined as
a fall from a height equal to or higher than the level of a stool,
chair, or the first rung of a ladder. These nonvertebral fractures
wereinitiallyself-reportedbutrequiredverificationfromsource
documents. Treatments were blinded from all assessors.
Changes in BMD from baseline were assessed at total
hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine at months 6, 12, and 18
(Bioclinica-Synarc). Serum markers of bone turnover, pro-
collagen type I N-terminal propeptide (s-PINP), and
carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I colla-
gen (s-CTX) were measured at months 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18
(Nordic Biosciences) in a subset of participants.
Perthestudy’
sstatisticalanalysisplan(Supplement2),pre-
planned exploratory end points included assessment of clini-
cal fractures (all fractures that would cause a patient to seek
medical care, regardless of the level of trauma, including clini-
cal spine), major osteoporotic fractures (fractures of the up-
per arm, wrist, hip, or clinical spine), and analyses comparing
abaloparatide and teriparatide.
Safety
Safety evaluations included physical examinations, assess-
ment of vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and reporting of
adverse events at each study visit. Twelve-lead electrocardio-
grams were performed at screening and at each study visit
prior to and 1 hour after injection of study drug. Serum cal-
cium concentrations were assessed at preinjection and at 4
hours postinjection on day 1, at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12, and
in the morning only at the month 18 visit. The protocol
allowed discontinuation of calcium, vitamin D, and the study
drug for hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria, which caused 1
participant from the abaloparatide group and 1 patient from
the teriparatide group to discontinue study participation.
The protocol specified that participants be withdrawn
from the study if they had confirmed significant deteriora-
tion from baseline (>7.0%) of BMD at lumbar spine or hip;
experienced treatment-related serious adverse events; devel-
oped severe hypersensitivity to subcutaneous abaloparatide
or teriparatide; were unable to complete study treatment;
refused treatment; developed protocol-defined hypercalce-
mia or hypercalciuria; or were lost to follow-up. Adverse
events and serious adverse events were coded according to
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 17.1.
Study Oversight
This study was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical
Practice and the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of
Helsinki. Several measures were prespecified to assure par-
ticipantsafety.Participantswerenotenrolledunlesstheycom-
pleted an extensive informed consent evaluation. All partici-
pants were provided calcium and vitamin D and were required
to meet a minimal vitamin D level for enrollment. Partici-
pants with confirmed bone loss from baseline of greater than
7.0% at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck were dis-
continuedfromthestudy.Participantswhoexperiencedafrac-
ture while in the study were offered an option to discontinue
and receive alternative treatment. All participants in the sub-
cutaneous abaloparatide and placebo groups were offered, af-
ter 18 months of treatment, enrollment in an extension study
in which they were treated with alendronate for 24 months.
Study protocols were approved by appropriate health authori-
ties and ethics committees at each site. An independent data
and safety monitoring board monitored study safety (see eAp-
pendix 2 in Supplement 3 for a listing of members).
Statistical Analysis
A statistical analysis plan (available in Supplement 2) was
created prior to data finalization and unblinding. There were
3 populations for efficacy analyses. The intent-to-treat (ITT)
population, which included all participants who were ran-
domized into the study and received a study medication kit
on day 1, was the primary population used for all efficacy
analyses except for those of vertebral fracture. The modified
ITT population, which included all ITT participants who had
both pretreatment and postbaseline spine x-rays, was the pri-
mary population used for analyses of vertebral fracture only.
The per-protocol population, which included modified ITT
participants who adhered with treatment and had no proto-
col violations, was used as a supportive population for effi-
cacy analyses; findings for the per-protocol population,
which were consistent with the ITT analyses, are not
included in this report.
The primary efficacy end point of this study was the per-
centage of participants with 1 or more incidents of new mor-
phometric vertebral fracture comparing abaloparatide and
placebo. Key secondary end points included percent change
in BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine at 18
months and incident nonvertebral fractures, both of which
were compared between abaloparatide and placebo. Addi-
tional comparisons are also described in this section. To con-
trol the overall significance level, a sequential testing plan
(with 8 specific tests after the primary comparison) was
defined. A hierarchical approach17 controlled the overall type
I error rate at the 2-sided significance level of 5% by prespeci-
fying the order of the hypothesis tests in a fixed sequence
before performing the tests. The efficacy end points were
tested in the following sequence: new vertebral fracture (aba-
loparatide vs placebo); BMD at the total hip, femoral neck,
lumbar spine (abaloparatide vs placebo at 18 months); non-
vertebral fracture (abaloparatide vs placebo); BMD at the
total hip and femoral neck (abaloparatide vs teriparatide at 6
months); nonvertebral fracture (abaloparatide vs teripara-
tide); and BMD at lumbar spine (abaloparatide vs teriparatide
at 6 months). Each of the tests was performed sequentially at
the 2-sided significance level of 5% to claim statistical signifi-
cance. At any step, if the significance level of 5% was not
attained, the P values for the subsequent comparisons were

generated as nominal for exploratory purposes. All statistical
analyses other than the fixed sequential testing were pre-
specified exploratory analyses, including analyses of clinical
fractures and major osteoporotic fractures, which are
described in this report.
The number of women with at least 1 new vertebral frac-
ture was compared using the Fisher exact test (between aba-
loparatide and placebo groups in the modified ITT popula-
tion). To evaluate the statistical effect of missing data on
incidence of new vertebral fractures, a sensitivity analysis was
performed based on the multiple imputation method. This
method used a logistic regression model to augment the data
set by imputing the missing outcome multiple times to char-
acterize the uncertainty of the imputation. The covariates in
the logistic model are listed in the statistical analysis plan
(Supplement 2). The primary efficacy analysis was repeated
using each of the augmented data sets, and the results were
combinedaccordingtoRubin.18Resultsofthesensitivityanaly-
sis were similar to the primary efficacy analysis.
Time to nonvertebral fracture was compared using the log-
rank test in all participants through the whole observational
period of 19 months (18 months of treatment plus 1 month of
follow-up). The Cox proportional hazards model was used to
calculate hazard ratios (HRs). Formal statistical tests were per-
formed in abaloparatide vs placebo groups and abaloparatide
vsteriparatidegroupsasspecifiedinthesequentialtestingplan.
This study reports percent change in BMD from baseline
at each study visit, which was compared using a mixed-effect
repeated-measuremodel.Ananalysisofcovariancemodelwith
missing data imputed and based on the last observation car-
ried forward is reported in eFigure 1 (in Supplement 3).
Boneturnovermarkerlevels,reportedasalogratioofpost-
baseline divided by baseline, were compared among groups

selectedsubsetofapproximately200participantsineachtreat-
ment group with paired measurements at baseline and follow-

geometric mean ratios for treatment comparisons (eFigure 2

mentgroups.Hypercalcemia,definedasalbumin-correctedse-
rum calcium of at least 10.7 mg/dL (≥2.67 mmol/L) at any time
point, was a prespecified safety end point and was analyzed
using a χ2 test.
The sample size was determined to provide 90% power at
a 2-sided α of .05 to detect a difference of 4% between treat-
ments, assuming a vertebral fracture rate of 7% in partici-
pants receiving placebo and 3% in participants receiving aba-
loparatide,adifferenceof4%,equivalentto57%riskreduction.
The sample size was calculated using a large-scale binomial
approximation. The required sample size was 622 per group.
To ensure an analysis size of 622 women, an overall sample
size of approximately 800 per treatment group was re-
cruited, anticipating that approximately 20% of participants
might not have a second set of evaluable radiographs avail-
able for analysis. This sample size would provide more than
90% power to detect significant percentage changes, consis-
tent with other drugs, in total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar
spine BMD. It would provide similar power to detect differ-
ences in hypercalcemia incidence between the abaloparatide
and teriparatide groups.
AllstatisticalanalyseswereperformedusingSASversion9.4.
Results
Atotalof5268womenunderwentscreeningforthetrial.There
were 2032 who failed to meet eligibility criteria, 698 declined
participation, 53 were not randomized, and 22 were excluded
for other reasons (Figure 1).
A total of 2463 women were randomized at 28 study cen-
ters in 10 countries to receive abaloparatide (n = 824 [33.5%]),
placebo (n = 821 [33.3%]), or open-label teriparatide (n = 818
[33.2%]).Overall,1901participants(77.2%)completedallstudy
visits: 637 (77.6%) in the placebo group, 606 (73.5%) in the aba-
loparatide group, and 658 (80.4%) in the teriparatide group,
and 2118 (86%) participants had postrandomization radio-
graphsthatwereassessedfornewmorphometricvertebralfrac-
tures (primary end point).
At baseline, mean age was 68.8 years, and mean femoral
neck T score was −2.1. Approximately 24% of participants had
a prevalent vertebral fracture, 31% reported a history of non-
vertebral fracture within the past 5 years, and 37% had no prior
fractures (Table 1). Baseline characteristics were similar among
treatment groups. During the study, the mean daily dosages
of vitamin D were 613 IU in the placebo group, 723 IU in the
abaloparatide group, and 625 IU in the teriparatide group, and
meandailycalciumdosageswere986mgintheplacebogroup,
955 mg in the abaloparatide group, and 894 mg in the teripa-
ratide group.
Each participant recorded study drug administration and
local tolerance in a weekly diary. According to the duration of
each individual’
s exposure during this study treatment pe-
riod (when participants were to remain on study medica-
tion), mean percent adherence to study drug administration
was greater than 90% for each of the 3 treatment groups.
Primary Outcome
New morphometric vertebral fractures occurred in 0.58%
(n = 4) of participants in the abaloparatide group and in 4.22%
(n = 30) of those in the placebo group (risk difference [RD] vs
placebo, −3.64 [95% CI, −5.42 to −2.10]; relative risk, 0.14 [95%
CI, 0.05 to 0.39]; P < .001; Table 2). In the teriparatide group,
new morphometric vertebral fractures occurred in 0.84%
(n = 6) of participants (RD vs placebo, −3.38 [95% CI, −5.18 to
−1.80]; relative risk, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.08 to 0.47]; P < .001). Re-
sults of the sensitivity analysis were similar to results of the
primary efficacy analysis.

formed and is presented in eFigure 1 (in Supplement 3).
The Kaplan-Meier estimated event rate for nonvertebral
fracture was 2.7% in the abaloparatide group vs 4.7% in the
placebo group, representing an RD of −2.01 (95% CI, −4.02 to
−0.00; hazard ratio [HR], 0.57 [95% CI, 0.32 to 1.00];
P = .049). The test of the proportional hazards assumption
was not significant (P = .76). However, the log-log plot

a The percentage of new vertebral fractures was calculated using the modified
intent-to-treat population at 18 months (placebo, n = 711; abaloparatide,
n = 690; teriparatide, n = 717). The percentage of nonvertebral, major
osteoporotic, and clinical fractures was cumulative Kaplan-Meier estimates
using the intent-to-treat population at 19 months (the entire observational
period including 18 months of treatment plus 1 month of follow-up).
bThe 95% CI for RD for new vertebral fractures was calculated using the
Newcombe method19; 95% CIs for RDs for nonvertebral, major osteoporotic,
and clinical fractures were calculated using the normal approximation with
difference in Kaplan-Meier estimates and standard error by Greenwood.20
c Values are reported as HR (95% CI) unless otherwise indicated.
dP values for new vertebral fractures were derived using the Fisher exact test.
P values for nonvertebral, major osteoporotic, and clinical fractures were
calculated using the log-rank test.
e Values comparing abaloparatide vs placebo, abaloparatide vs teriparatide, and
teriparatide vs placebo are reported as relative risks (95% CIs) for new
vertebral fractures.

showed slight deviations from the assumption, suggesting
that the log-rank test was more robust than the Wald-based
inference using the Cox proportional hazards model when
making statistical inferences. There were 2 hip fractures over
the course of the study; both hip fractures were in the pla-
cebo group (eTable in Supplement 3).
BMD increases from baseline to month 6 in the
abaloparatide-treated group were greater than those in the
teriparatide group at the total hip (2.32% vs 1.44%; treatment
difference, 0.83% [95% CI, 0.58% to 1.08%]; P < .001) and
femoral neck (1.72% vs 0.87%; treatment difference, 0.81%
[95% CI, 0.49% to 1.12%]; P < .001; Figure 2). The last obser-
vation carried forward showed similar results (eFigure 1 in
Supplement 3).
The Kaplan-Meier estimated event rate for nonvertebral
fracture was 2.7% in the abaloparatide group vs 3.3% in the
teriparatide group, indicating an RD of −0.55 (95% CI, −2.34 to
1.24; HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.43 to 1.45]; P = .44; Figure 3, Table 2).
Because of the hierarchical sequence, comparison of
change in BMD at the lumbar spine at 6 months between aba-
loparatide and teriparatide must be interpreted as explor-
atory. There was a significantly greater increase in the
abaloparatide-treated group (6.58%) than in the teriparatide
group(5.25%)(treatmentdifference,1.32[95%CI,0.86to1.79];
nominal P < .001; Figure 2). The last observation carried for-
ward showed similar results (eFigure 1 in Supplement 3).
Prespecified Exploratory Outcomes
There was a significant reduction with abaloparatide vs pla-
cebo in 2 prespecified exploratory fracture end points. For all
clinical fractures, regardless of level of trauma, the Kaplan-
Meier estimated event rate was 4.0% for the abaloparatide
group vs 8.3% for the placebo group (RD, −4.24 [95% CI,
−7.93 to −0.54]; HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.91]; P = .02;
Table 2). For major osteoporotic fractures, the Kaplan-Meier
estimated event rate was 1.5% for the abaloparatide group vs
6.2% for the placebo group (RD, −4.73 [95% CI, −8.07 to
−1.40]; HR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.61]; P < .001; Table 2).
Comparison of abaloparatide with teriparatide for major
osteoporotic fractures was also a prespecified exploratory
end point. The Kaplan-Meier estimated event rate for teripa-
ratide was 3.1% (RD for abaloparatide vs teriparatide, −1.65
[95% CI, −3.18 to −0.11]; HR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.21 to 0.95];
P = .03; Table 2). Kaplan-Meier curves for time to clinical
fracture and major osteoporotic fracture are shown in
Figure 3. Kaplan-Meier estimated event rates in the teripara-
tide group of 3.3% for nonvertebral fractures (RD vs placebo,
−1.46 [95% CI, −3.50 to 0.58]; HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.42 to 1.22];
P = .22; Table 2), 4.8% for clinical fractures (RD vs placebo,
−3.51 [95% CI, −7.22 to 0.21]; HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.46 to 1.09];
P = .11; Table 2), and 3.1% for major osteoporotic fractures
(RD vs placebo, −3.09 [95% CI, −6.53 to 0.36]; HR, 0.67 [95%
CI, 0.39 to 1.14]; P = .14; Table 2) were not significantly differ-
ent from placebo (Figure 3).
Prespecified exploratory BMD outcomes included com-
parison between abaloparatide and placebo for change from
baseline at 6 and 12 months at total hip, femoral neck, and
lumbar spine (Figure 2). For total hip at 6 months, BMD
increased 2.32% (95% CI, 2.13% to 2.50%) in the abalopara-
tide group vs 0.31% (95% CI, 0.16% to 0.47%) in the placebo
group (P < .001), and at 12 months, BMD increased 3.41%
(95% CI, 3.17%% to 3.64%) in the abaloparatide group vs
0.09% (95% CI, −0.10% to 0.29%) in the placebo group
(P < .001). For femoral neck at 6 months, BMD increased
1.72% (95% CI, 1.49% to 1.95%) in the abaloparatide group vs
−0.13% (95% CI, −0.34% to 0.08%) in the placebo group
(P < .001), and at 12 months, BMD increased 2.65% (95% CI,
2.36% to 2.93%) in the abaloparatide group vs −0.41% (95%
CI, −0.64% to −0.17%) in the placebo group (P < .001). For
lumbar spine at 6 months, BMD increased 6.58% (95% CI,

Mean percent changes in bone mineral density at the total hip, femoral neck,
and lumbar spine were evaluated using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry based
on the intent-to-treat population. Values shown are mean percent change from
baseline using a mixed-effect repeated-measures model. Improvements in bone
mineral density associated with abaloparatide were significantly greater than
with placebo at all 3 sites and at all time points (P < .001). Improvements with
teriparatide were significantly greater than with placebo at all 3 sites at all time
points (P < .001). Improvements with abaloparatide were significantly greater
than those with teriparatide at the total hip and femoral neck at all time points
(P < .001) and at lumbar spine at 6 and 12 months (P < .001). Error bars indicate
95% CIs.

A, Kaplan-Meier curves indicate time
to the first nonvertebral fracture—a
prespecified secondary end point.
Nonvertebral fractures were defined
as fractures excluding those of the
spine, sternum, patella, toes, fingers,
skull, and face and those with high
trauma. For abaloparatide vs placebo,
the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.57 (95%
CI, 0.32-1.00; P = .049) and for
teriparatide vs placebo, the HR was
0.72 (95% CI, 0.42-1.22; P = .22).
B, Curves indicate time to the first
clinical fracture—a prespecified
exploratory end point. Clinical
fractures were defined as all fractures
that would cause a patient to seek
medical care, regardless of the level
of trauma, including clinical spine. For
abaloparatide vs placebo, the HR was
0.57 (95% CI, 0.35-0.91; P = .02) and
for teriparatide vs placebo, the HR
was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.46-1.09; P = .11).
C, Curves indicate time to the first
major osteoporotic fracture—a
prespecified exploratory end point.
Major osteoporotic fractures were
defined as fractures of the wrist,
upper arm, hip, and clinical spine. For
abaloparatide vs placebo, the HR was
0.30 (95% CI, 0.15-0.61; P < .001)
and for teriparatide vs placebo, the
HR was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.39-1.14;
P = .14).
The median durations in days of
follow-up for all 3 fracture categories
were 568 (interquartile range [IQR],
557-572) for placebo, 568 (IQR,
477-572) for abaloparatide, and 567
(IQR, 558-571) for teriparatide.

Change from baseline BMD for the teriparatide group is
shown in Figure 2. For the total hip, teriparatide was associ-
ated with a BMD increase of 2.29% (95% CI, 2.07% to 2.52%)
at 12 months and an increase of 3.26% (95% CI, 3.00% to
3.51%) at 18 months (Figure 2). For the femoral neck, teripara-
tide was associated with a BMD increase of 1.54% (95% CI,
1.28% to 1.80%) at 12 months and an increase of 2.66% (95%
CI, 2.38% to 2.93%) at 18 months (Figure 2). For the lumbar
spine, teriparatide was associated with a BMD increase of
8.28% (95% CI, 7.90% to 8.66%) at 12 months and an increase
of 10.49% (95% CI, 10.05% to 10.94%) at 18 months
(Figure 2). Improvements with abaloparatide were signifi-
cantly greater than those with teriparatide at the total hip
and femoral neck at all time points (P < .001), at lumbar spine
at 6 and 12 months (P < .001), but not at lumbar spine at 18
months (P = .17). The last observation carried forward
showed similar results (eFigure 1 in Supplement 3).
Other Efficacy Outcomes
The bone formation marker s-PINP and the resorption marker
s-CTX showed significant increases among abaloparatide-
and teriparatide-treated participants compared with placebo
at 3, 6, and 12 months (P < .001; Figure 4; eFigure 2 in
Supplement 3). There was a different pattern of change in
bone turnover markers with the 2 anabolic agents. For bone
formation, initial increases in the first month were similar,
but by 3 months, bone formation began to decrease in the
abaloparatide group compared with the teriparatide group.
Similarly, the increase in s-CTX was less in the abaloparatide
group than in the teriparatide group.
Adverse Events
Adverse events were evaluated descriptively. There were no
evident differences between treatment groups in proportion
of participants with 1 or more treatment-emergent adverse
events, serious adverse events, or adverse events leading to
death. Serious treatment-emergent adverse events appeared
balanced between treatment groups: placebo, 90 (11.0%);
abaloparatide, 80 (9.7%); and teriparatide, 82 (10.0%).
There were more adverse events leading to study dis-
continuation in the abaloparatide group (9.9%) than in
either the teriparatide (6.8%) or placebo (6.1%) groups.
Adverse events that most often led to study drug discon-
tinuation in the abaloparatide group were nausea (1.6%),
dizziness (1.2%), headache (1.0%), and palpitations (0.9%),
which were generally mild to moderate in severity. Serious
adverse events leading to discontinuation appeared to occur
at similar rates in the abaloparatide and teriparatide groups
and with apparently greater frequency than in the placebo
group (Table 3).
Hypercalcemia was predefined as albumin-corrected
serum calcium level of at least 10.7 mg/dL (or ≥2.67 mmol/L),
and overall incidence was significantly lower in the abalo-
paratide group (3.4%) than the teriparatide group (6.4%) (RD,
−2.96 [95% CI, −5.12 to −0.87]; P = .006) for any time point
including predose and postdose. Likewise, the 4-hour, post-
dose overall incidence of hypercalcemia was significantly
lower in the abaloparatide group (3.42%) than the teripara-
tide group (6.1%) (P = .01). There was no evidence of
increased cardiovascular risk associated with hypercalcemia

Discussion
In this trial of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis,
daily subcutaneous administration of abaloparatide for 18
months significantly reduced the risk of new vertebral and
nonvertebral fractures compared with placebo. Treatment
with abaloparatide was also associated with modestly higher
BMD gains, especially at sites rich in cortical bone, compared
with the placebo and teriparatide groups. The incidence of
hypercalcemia was lower with abaloparatide than with
teriparatide treatment, consistent with proportionally less
bone resorption with abaloparatide. Overall, there were no
differences in serious adverse events between the treatment
groups.
Comparison of abaloparatide vs teriparatide for the pri-
mary efficacy end point was not part of the study objectives
because the study would have required a sample size of ap-
proximately22 000pertreatmentgrouptoprovide90%power
to detect the treatment difference between abaloparatide (ob-
served rate, 0.58%) and teriparatide (observed rate, 0.84%)
based on our study results. Teriparatide treatment was asso-
ciated with reduction in new vertebral fractures. In contrast
to the findings of Neer et al,14 the incidence of nonvertebral

fractures in the teriparatide-treated group was not signifi-
cantly different from placebo in this study. However, the cur-
rent trial enrolled a larger and broader population than the
teriparatide fracture trial, and this trial did not require a preva-
lent vertebral fracture for enrollment. These factors may con-
tribute to the different findings in these studies.

toclarifytheeffectsofdifferingpatternsofboneturnovermarkers
to better understand the interplay of formation and resorption.
Differences in the effects of teriparatide and abalopara-
tide may be related to differing biologic effects. The differen-
tial binding of abaloparatide compared with teriparatide leads
to parathyroid type 1 receptor conformation binding selectiv-
ity that favors anabolic activity.15,23,24 As a result, abalopara-
tide may provide more transient stimulation of osteoblast cy-
clic adenosine monophosphate production and may result in
lower expression of osteoblast-derived RANK-ligand. This
could result in less stimulation of bone resorption.
Early antifracture efficacy has been highlighted as a ma-
jorneedinosteoporosis,particularlyamongpatientswithprior
fractures.25,26 In the current trial, the Kaplan-Meier curves for
time to first event for nonvertebral fractures suggest early
fracture risk reduction. Similar findings were made for the pre-
specified exploratory end points of major osteoporotic frac-
tures and clinical fractures with abaloparatide treatment.
To ensure the safety of participants in a placebo-controlled
trial, the following safeguards, including an informed con-
sent that clearly defined risks, were incorporated into the trial
design. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, which are
recognized treatments for reducing fracture risk, was re-
quiredduringthetrialforallparticipants.27-29Therewerestrict
limitations on the range of acceptable BMD and number and
type of fractures prior to study entry to limit the overall risk.
The trial was also overseen by an external independent data
monitoring committee that periodically reviewed unblinded
safety data. Each participant who sustained a radiologically
confirmed incident fracture was required to sign an addi-
tional informed consent if the participant chose to remain in
the study. BMD was measured every 6 months, and if exces-
sive bone loss30 was identified and confirmed in any partici-
pant, study medication was discontinued and the participant
was offered conventional treatment. In addition, at the end of
the 18-month study, any participants randomized to receive
theplacebowereofferedactiveopen-labeltreatmentwithalen-
dronate for 2 additional years.
Study Limitations
This study has limitations. Sixty-three percent of partici-
pants had a prior fracture; it cannot be determined from these
data whether abaloparatide would have similar preventive and
osteoanabolic effects among participants at lower risk for frac-
ture. In this study, only a small number of fracture events oc-
curred across treatment groups, with the event rate in the pla-
cebo group being smaller than anticipated. Although the event
rate was lower than anticipated in the sample size calcula-
tion, the reduction in risk was larger than anticipated. These
data indicate a reduction of risk until 18 months of treatment;
it is not clear how long the benefit associated with abalopara-
tide may endure. In addition, the open-label teriparatide group
may have resulted in bias in reporting subjective measures,
such as safety events or differences in adherence, because par-
ticipants and investigators were aware of the treatment.
Conclusions
Among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, the use of
subcutaneous abaloparatide, compared with placebo, re-
ducedtheriskofnewvertebralandnonvertebralfracturesover
18 months. Further research is needed to understand the clini-
cal importance of RD, the the risks and benefits of abalopara-
tide treatment, and the efficacy of abaloparatide vs other os-
teoporosis treatments.
