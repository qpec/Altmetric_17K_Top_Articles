Out

The 
primary 
endpoint 
of 
this 
study 
was 
the 
proportion 
of 
patients 
with 
a 
confi

objective

(defi
 
ned 
as 
the 
number 
of

with 
a

l
 
response 
of 
compl
ete 
response 
or 
partial
 
response 
as 
per 
investigator-
assessed RECIST divided by the number of assigned 
patients).
 
Objective 
response 
was 
the 
primary 
endpoint 
because the trial
 objective was to eval
uate antitumour 
activity of nivol
umab al
one or in combination with 
ipil
imumab.
The secondary endpoints incl
uded overal
l
 survival
, 
progression-

, 
duration 
of 
response, 
and 
the 
occurrence 
of 
treatment-
rel

adverse 
events 
l
eading 
to 
treatment 
discontinuation.
 
Overal
l
 
survival
 
was 
defi

as 
the 
time 
between 
the 
date 
of 
treatment 
assignment 
and 
the 
date 
of 
death 
due 
to 
any 
cause.
 
Progression-

survival
 was defi

assignment 
to 
the 
date 
of 
the 
fi
 
rst 
documented 
tumour 
progression, 
as 
determined 
by 
the 
investigator, 
or 
death 
due

whichever 
occurred

Duration 
of 
response was defi

of 
partial
 
or

until
 
the

 The correl

In paral
l
el
 to the safety eval

combination arms, enrol

l
owed a 
Simon two-
stage design.
24 Stage 1 of the study was 
intended to assess the effi
 
 
cacy of nivol
umab and 
ipil
imumab in 18 patients per treatment group, to 
determine 
whether 
enrol
ment 
shoul
d 
continue 
to 
stage 
2.
 
However, 
enrol
ment 
and 
treatment 
of 
18 
individual
s 
in 
the 
nivol
umab 
monotherapy 
group 
coul
d 
begin 
whil
e 
the 
initial
 dose cohort of the combination cohorts was 
ongoing.
 
This 
design 
was 
used 
to 
test 
whether 
nivol
umab, 
or the combination of nivol
umab and ipil
imumab, or 
both, yiel
ded an objective response in a suffi
 
 
cient 
proportion 
of 
patients 
to 
be 
of 
cl
inical
 
interest 
in 
each 
of 
the 
tumour 
types;
 
it 
al
so 
l
imited 
the 
expected 
number 
of 
patients who woul
d receive treatment if the true 
proportion 
of 
patients 
achieving 
a 
response 
was 
not 
of 
cl
inical
 val
ue.
 The two-
stage test was conducted 
independentl
y 
in 
each 
treatment 
cohort.
For 
each 
treatment 
cohort, 
the 
modifi
 
ed 
Simon 
design 
required 
18 
treated 
patients 
for 
the 
fi
 
rst 
stage 
and 
cal
l
ed 
for 
termination 
at 
this 
stage 
if 
onl
y 
one 
patient 
or 
no 
patients in the cohort had a confi
 
rmed partial
 or 
compl
ete 
response.
 
If 
two 
or 
more 
patients 
responded 
in 
the fi
 
rst stage, additional
 patients were assigned in 
stage 
2, 
to 
a 
total
 
of 
40 
treated 
patients 
in 
that 
cohort.
 
The 
treatment 
was 
considered 
of 
cl
inical
 
interest 
if, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
second 
stage, 
there 
were 
eight 
or 
more 
patients with a response among 40 treated patients.
 
Enrol
ment 
in 
stage 
2 
in 
a 
particul
ar 
treatment 
cohort 
coul
d 
continue 
even 
if 
the 
other 
treatment 
cohorts 
were 
stil
l
 
in 
stage 
1.
 
The 
modifi
 
ed 
Simon 
design 
tested 
the 
nul
l
 hypothesis that the true proportion of patients 
achieving a response was ≤10% versus the al
ternative 
hypothesis 
that 
the 
true 
proportion 
of 
patients 
achieving 
a 
response 
was 
>10%.
 
The 
two-
stage 
testing 
within 
each 
cohort 
targeted 
a 
type 
I 
error 
rate 
of 
5% 
and 
had 
80% 
power 
to

Objective responses were observed in patients with

In a post-

Disc
ussion
Our fi
 
ndings show that nivol
umab monotherapy 
and nivol
umab pl
us ipil
imumab provide cl
inical
l
y 
meaningful
 
activity 
and 
an 
acceptabl

with 
l
imited-
stage 
or 
extensive-
stage 
SCLC 
and 
disease progression after at l
east one previous 
pl
atinum-
containing regimen.
 The prognosis for 
patients 
with 
progression 
after 
previous 
treatment 
with 
pl
atinum-
based chemotherapy is poor.
 Patients with 
advanced 
SCLC 
frequentl
y 
respond 
to 
fi
 
rst-
l
ine 
therapy;
 
however, recurrence is inevitabl
e, and few eff
 
ective 
options 
at 
the 
time 
of 
progression 
and 
in 
patients 
with 
pl
atinum-
resistant disease are avail
abl
e.
 Patients with 
extensive-
stage SCLC have a 2-
year survival
 of l
ess 
than 
5%.

Al
though

was 
l

3·5 
months 
(range 
1·4–14·7) 
for 
al

patients.
 
Rova-
T, 
a 
DLL3-
targeted 
antibody-
drug conjugate, showed antitumour activity 
and 
manageabl
e 
toxicity 
in 
a 
phase 
1 
study 
of 
patients 
with SCLC and progression after one or two previous 
l
ines 
of 
therapy.
27 
An 
objective 
response 
was 
achieved 
in 
seven (44%) of 16 patients positive for the DLL3 
biomarker 
treated 
at 
the 
maximum 
tol
erated 
doses.
Limitations of our study incl
ude that the study 
cohorts 
were 
not 
randomised, 
and 
the 
study 
was 
not 
powered for formal
 comparisons across cohorts.
 
Basel
ine characteristics were general
l
y simil
ar across 
the 
cohorts, 
and 
al
though 
the 
combination 
treatment 
cohorts 
showed 
simil
ar 
responses, 
responses 
seemed 
to be deeper with the nivol
umab 1 mg/kg pl
us 
ipil
imumab 3 mg/kg regimen.
 This dosing regimen 
has al
so been shown to be effi
 
 
cacious in previousl
y 
untreated 
mel
anoma.
16
The activity of nivol
umab as monotherapy or 
combined 
with 
ipil
imumab 
in 
patients 
irrespective 
of 
pl
atinum 
sensitivity 
or 
l
ine 
of 
therapy 
is 
an 
important 
aspect diff
 
erentiating immune-
checkpoint inhibitors 
from topotecan or amrubicin in SCLC.
 Response to 
topotecan depends on chemosensitivity, driven by 
tumour resistance mutations.
7,8 By contrast, the 
genomical
l
y unstabl
e nature of SCLC2 might make it 
sensitive 
to 
immune-
checkpoint 
bl
ockade 
via 
induction 
or restoration of a tumour antigen-
driven immune 
response.
 Because few l
ympho 
cytes are observed in 
SCLC 
tumours,28 
one 
hypothesis 
is 
that 
there 
is 
a 
greater 
need 
to 
target 
the 
l
ymphoid 
compartment 
with 
CTLA-
4 
inhibition 
in 
addition 
to 
PD-
1 
inhibition 
to 
maximise 
the 
treatment 
eff
 
ect.
29
Some studies have shown increased activity of PD-
1 
bl
ockade in patients with PD-
L1-
expressing NSCLC.
 
However, 
data, 
incl
uding 
from 
this 
study, 
suggest 
that 
there 
is 
a 
l
ower 
preval
ence 
of 
PD-
L1 
expression 
in 
SCLC 
versus NSCLC.
9,10,30 A trial
 of pembrol
izumab,30 a PD-
1 
immune-
checkpoint inhibitor, reported an initial
 
response in four (25%) of 16 patients and durabl
e 
responses 
in 
patients 
with 
PD-
L1-
positive 
extensive-
stage 
SCLC.
 
In 
our 
study, 
objective 
responses 
were 
observed 
in 
patients 
irrespective 
of 
PD-
L1 
expression, 
incl
uding 
deep 
tumour responses in patients with PD-
L1 tumour 
expression 
l
ess 
than 
1%.
 
Whether 
PD-
L1 
expression 
is 
predictive 
of 
benefi
 
t 
in 
SCLC 
must 
await 
anal
ysis 
in 
a 
l
arger 
popul
ation.
Al
though 
more 
than 
hal
f 
of 
patients 
in 
this 
trial
 
had 
received two or more chemotherapy regimens, 1-
year 
overal
l
 
survival
 
(33% 
for 
nivol
umab 
3 
mg/kg 
and 
43% 
for 
nivol
umab 
1 
mg/kg 
pl
us 
ipil
imumab 
3 
mg/kg) 
was 
comparabl
e with or better than that reported in 
historical
 
trial
s 
of 
second-
l
ine 
topotecan 
or 
amrubicin.
7,8,26 
Consistent with other trial
s with immune-
checkpoint 
inhibitors across mul
tipl
e sol
id tumours, and unl
ike 
trial
s 
of 
topotecan,8 
fi
 
ndings 
from 
our 
study 
showed 
a 
fl
 
attening of the overal
l
 survival
 curves for the 
nivol
umab 3 mg/kg and nivol
umab 1 mg/kg pl
us 
ipil
imumab 3 mg/kg cohorts, suggesting a survival
 
benefi
 
t 
in 
a 
subset 
of 
patients.
9,10,12 
However, 
because 
of 
the 
smal
l
 
numbers 
in 
this 
trial
, 
it 
is 
diffi
 
 
cul
t 
to 
determine 
when 
this 
occurs.
 
Al
so 
consistent 
with 
fi
 
ndings 
from 
previous randomised trial
s of immuno-
oncol
ogy 
agents,9,10,12 there seems to be a greater eff
 
ect of 
nivol
umab 
or 
ipil
imumab 
treatment 
on 
overal
l
 
survival
 
than 
progression-
free 
survival
.
Adverse 
events 
were 
managed 
using 
establ
ished 
safety 
guidel
ines.
9,10,13,16 Most toxic eff
 
ects in the nivol
umab 
3 mg/kg and nivol
umab 3 mg/kg pl
us ipil
imumab 
1 mg/kg cohorts were mil
d to moderate, with onl
y 
six 
(6%) 
patients 
in 
the 
nivol
umab 
3 
mg/kg 
group 
and 
four 
(7%) 
in 
the 
nivol
umab 
3 
mg/kg 
pl

1 
mg/kg 
group 
discontinuing 
because 
of 
toxicity.
 
More 
treatment-

grade 
3 
or 
4 
adverse 
events 
occurred 
in 
the nivol
umab 1 mg/kg pl
us ipil
imumab 3 mg/kg 
cohort, 
with 
seven 
(11%) 
patients 
discontinuing 
because 
of 
toxicity.
 
This 
regimen 
was 
used

y 
and 
safel
y 
in 
a 
phase 
3 
trial
 
in 
patients 
with 
mel

suggesting 
that 
this 
schedul
e 
is 
feasibl
e 
in 
patients 
with 
SCLC.
16 
In 
al
l
 cohorts, fewer treatment-
rel

ects were 
reported when compared with trial
s of topotecan or 
amrubicin.

these 
events 
seems 
to be higher in patients with SCLC compared with 
other 
mal
ignant 
diseases, 
perhaps 
due 
to 
the 
tendency 
for paraneopl
astic neurol
ogical
 syndromes associated 
with 
this 
disease.
 
Treatment-
rel
ated 
pneumonitis 
was 
reported in eight patients across al
l
 the treatment 
cohorts 
and 
resul
ted 
in 
death 
in 
one 
patient 
receiving 
nivol
umab 3 mg/kg pl
us ipil
imumab 1 mg/kg.
 
It is crucial
 to cl
osel
y monitor for immune-
rel

adverse 
events 
or 
unmasking 
of 
previousl
y 
subcl
inical
 
autoimmune disease processes, with prompt impl
e-

ines for eff
 
ective 
management.
On the basis of these encouraging phase 1/2 data,
