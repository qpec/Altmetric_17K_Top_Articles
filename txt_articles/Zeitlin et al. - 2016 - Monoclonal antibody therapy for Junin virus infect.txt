Countermeasures against potential biothreat agents remain im-
portant to US Homeland Security, and many of these pharmaceu-
ticals could have dual use in the improvement of global public
health. Junin virus, the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic
fever (AHF), is an arenavirus identified as a category A high-prior-
ity agent. There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ap-
proved drugs available for preventing or treating AHF, and the
current treatment option is limited to administration of immune
plasma. Whereas immune plasma demonstrates the feasibility of
passive immunotherapy, it is limited in quantity, variable in qual-
ity, and poses safety risks such as transmission of transfusion-borne
diseases. In an effort to develop a monoclonal antibody (mAb)-
based alternative to plasma, three previously described neutral-
izing murine mAbs were expressed as mouse-human chimeric an-
tibodies and evaluated in the guinea pig model of AHF. These mAbs
provided 100% protection against lethal challenge when adminis-
tered 2 d after infection (dpi), and one of them (J199) was capable of
providing 100% protection when treatment was initiated 6 dpi and
92% protection when initiated 7 dpi. The efficacy of J199 is superior
to that previously described for all other evaluated drugs, and its
high potency suggests that mAbs like J199 offer an economical
alternative to immune plasma and an effective dual use (bioterror-
ism/public health) therapeutic.

J
unin virus (JUNV), a member of the genus Arenavirus, is the
causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF). Al-
though still confined to Argentina, its geographical distribution
has expanded since its discovery in 1958. As an endemic virus
spread by native ineradicable rodent populations, JUNV could
be acquired during natural outbreaks for bioterror purposes and
could naturally spread outside of its current range. The relatively
slow onset of AHF with its unspecific symptoms that may delay
diagnosis, coupled with its debilitating hemorrhagic phase, make
JUNV a serious threat to public health (1, 2). With the use of an
attenuated vaccine manufactured in Argentina (3) in high-risk
individuals, the incidence of AHF has declined, but cases continue
to be reported. Untreated, AHF has a mortality rate of 20–30%;
however, treatment with immune plasma within 8 d of symptoms
reduces the mortality rate to 1% (4, 5).
Investigators have evaluated a variety of potential alternatives
to immune plasma in guinea pigs, the most commonly used
JUNV animal model. Testing the hypothesis that a low dose of
cyclophosphamide could lead to an enhanced immune response,
Ponzinibbio et al., found a small survival benefit (17%) and delay
to death against a uniformly lethal JUNV challenge (6). The
antiviral, ribavirin, has been tested in multiple studies, but no
more than 50% survival was observed with high doses starting 1 h
after infection (7). More recently, favipiravir (T-705), an antiviral
approved for use against influenza in Japan and evaluated clin-
ically against Ebola virus in Guinea, was found to provide up to
78% survival in the guinea pig model when treatment was
initiated 2 d after infection (8). However, none of these experi-
mental agents have proven as efficacious as immune plasma or
convalescent serum, which have been shown to provide 100%
protection to guinea pigs when delivered as late as 6 d after in-
fection (9).
With the expanding clinical use of monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) for acute and chronic conditions, it has become clear
that mAbs offer a highly specific, potent, and generally safe
(especially for nonhuman antigen targets) drug platform for
antivirals and may be a useful alternative to immune plasma (5).
In this study, three previously described anti-JUNV glycoprotein
(GP) neutralizing mAbs (10) were evaluated. These mAbs
were chimerized, expressed transiently in transgenic Nicotiana
benthamiana (11), and evaluated in vitro and in the guinea
pig model.
Results
Production of the Chimeric mAbs in N. benthamiana. The three
mAbs were expressed by using the magnICON system (12) to
vacuum infiltrate 1–2 kg (per manufacturing run) of transgenic
N. benthamiana capable of generating mammalian-like N-glycans
(13). Yields of the three mAbs postprotein A affinity chroma-
tography were 226 ± 29 mg/kg for J199 (n = 5 production runs),
243 ± 77 mg/kg for J200 (n = 3), and 170 ± 56 mg/kg for J202
(n = 3). The N-glycosylation profiles of the mAbs (Table 1) were
consistent with previous reports of mAbs purified from the
Significance
There are no Food and Drug Administration approved drugs
available for preventing or treating Argentine hemorrhagic
fever (AHF), and the current treatment option is limited to
administration of immune plasma. With the expanding clinical
use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for acute and chronic
conditions, it has become clear that mAbs offer a highly spe-
cific, potent, and generally safe drug platform for antivirals,
and may be a useful alternative to immune plasma. Here, we
show that mAbs are effective in the Junin virus guinea pig
model and likely to be an economical therapy for AHF.

GnGn glycoform.
Neutralization Potency of the Chimeric JUNV mAbs. The three chi-
meric anti-JUNV mAbs were tested in a plaque neutralization
assay by using the Candid #1 strain. Neutralization titers had
been reported for the fully murine mAbs in ascites fluid (10), but
because the concentration of the mAbs was not reported, the
mAbs relative potency was unknown. As Fig. 1 illustrates, J199
and J200 had similar high neutralization potency (PRN50: 76 and
68 ng/mL, respectively), whereas J202 was the least potent of the
three (PRN50: 388 ng/mL).
Efficacy of the Chimeric JUNV mAbs in the Guinea Pig Model. In a
pilot experiment, outbred guinea pigs were administered an i.p.
challenge with JUNV (Romero strain). Two days later, animals
received an i.p. dose of 10 mg of mAb or were not treated. The
10-mg (∼20 mg/kg) dose used throughout these pilot studies was
selected as a convenient dose consistent with dosing of the two
mAbs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
for infectious disease indications (Synagis for respiratory syncy-
tial virus is dosed at 15 mg/kg and Raxibacumab for anthrax is
dosed at 40 mg/kg). As Fig. 2A illustrates, all animals treated
with one of the three anti-JUNV GP mAbs survived lethal
challenge, whereas untreated control animals succumbed to in-
fection (P < 0.05 by Mantel–Cox).
To better distinguish the protective efficacy conferred by the
three mAbs, a second experiment was performed in which guinea
pigs were treated 7 and 11 d after infection. Treated animals
received either 10 mg of one of the mAbs, or 10 mg of an
equimolar mixture of all three of the mAbs (Fig. 2B). J199
provided 100% protection (P < 0.001 compared with control),
J200 provided partial protection (67%; P < 0.01), J202 provided
minimal protection (17%), and the three mAb mixture provided
50% protection. Although all controls succumbed to disease by
day 16 after infection, mAb-treated animals that did not survive
experienced a delay to death. Many of the treated animals ex-
periencing a delay to death exhibited symptoms of neurological
disease between days 18 and 30 (e.g., impaired hind leg use).
Because of its superior efficacy (Fig. 2B), J199 was selected for
further evaluation. To determine the breadth of the therapeutic
window, groups of guinea pigs were treated starting 6, 7, or 9 d
after infection and received a second dose 3–4 d later. When
treatment began on day 6 or 7 after infection, 100% (P < 0.001)
or 83% (P < 0.005) of animals survived (Fig. 3, Top Left). In
contrast, when treatment was initiated 9 d after infection, all
animals succumbed, but a delay to death was observed (P <
0.01). A detectable viral load was observed in 67%, 83%, and
100% of animals on day 6, 7, and 9 after infection (plasma was
sampled before mAb dosing), respectively (Fig. 3, Top Right). At
day 14 after infection, untreated control animals had a mean
plasma viral load of 3.4 ± 0.4 × 105 pfu/mL, whereas none of the
animals treated with J199 had detectable virus. The absence of
detectable virus on day 14 in treated animals could indicate that
either no virus was present or that any virus that was present was
neutralized by J199 and, therefore, undetectable in the plaque
assay. Illness in all animals was associated with weight loss and
a rapid temperature drop before death (Fig. 3, Bottom). Fever,
presumably from the viral infection, peaked on day 6 for the day
6/10 treatment group (average of +0.3 °C from baseline), on day
7 for the day 7/11 group (+1.4 °C), and on day 9 for the day 9/12
(+1.5 °C) and untreated control groups (+1.4 °C). We speculate
that the earlier fever in treated animals may have been due to
physiologic responses to the killing of JUNV-infected host cells
upon administration of the mAb.
The three nontreated control guinea pigs all had high viral
loads in liver (> 6.78 log10 pfu/g), spleen (> 6.78 log10 pfu/g) and
brain tissue (5.64 ± 0.56 log10 pfu/g) on day 13 or 14 after in-
fection. None of the treated animals that survived to the study

Virus was detectable in brain tissue (3 of 3) of treated animals
that succumbed to infection (days 21 and 30) at levels ranging
from 2.70 to 5.32 log10 pfu/g.
The three nontreated control animals had detectable pathol-
ogy in the liver, spleen, and brain tissue on day 13 or 14 after
infection (Table 2 and Fig. 4). Significant immunolabeling for
JUNV antigen was identified in all three control animals, spe-
cifically in hepatocytes, in endothelium and mononuclear cells
within the red and white pulp of the spleen, and in individual to
clustered neurons, often associated with glial nodules. Surviving
J199-treated animals necropsied on day 40 after infection (Table
2 and Fig. 4) displayed pathology that was minor in the liver,
absent in the spleen, and with more central nervous system
involvement than observed in the untreated controls that suc-
cumbed to infection on day 13 or 14. Significant immunolabeling
for JUNV antigen was identified in 3/5 and 2/2 guinea pigs
treated on days 7+11 and 9+12, respectively, only in individual to
clustered neurons, often associated with glial nodules.
Discussion
In this study, we produced three anti-JUNV GP neutralizing
mouse-human chimeric mAbs in N. benthamiana (16). The mAbs
exhibited potent neutralizing activity, and the neutralization

*Control animals evaluated histologically at earlier time points (day 13 or 14) uniformly had diffuse gliosis only, indicating an initial
response of the neural tissues to the JUNV virus but not enough time to recruit a peripheral inflammatory response to the neural
tissues. Most animals evaluated histologically at a later time point (day 21 and day 40) show the ability to recruit a peripheral
inflammatory response manifesting as inflammation in the meninges and cuffing of vessels within the brain parenchyma
(lymphoplasmacytic meningoencephalitis). In treated animals, however, those treated on day 6+10 lack JUNV antigen, whereas those
treated at day 7+11 have approximately half of the animals, and all of the animals treated at day 9+12 showing JUNV antigen

 potency appeared to correlate with protection in guinea pigs,
with the most potent neutralizer providing the greatest efficacy.
Although clinical dosing is based on the neutralization titer of
immune plasma (4), there is some evidence that neutralization of
free JUNV may not be the primary mechanism of action of IgG
antibodies. Kenyon et al. found that F(ab′)2 had identical neu-
tralizing activity to the IgG from which it was prepared. How-
ever, the F(ab′)2 provided no survival benefit to guinea pigs even
when administered at doses greater than required for 100%
protection with intact IgG. Further, no decrease in organ viral
load was observed in F(ab′)2-treated animals compared with
untreated infected controls (17). These results suggested that
immune effector functions (i.e., complement or Fcγ receptor-
mediated) are critical for therapeutic benefit by polyclonal an-
tibodies in JUNV-infected animals. Importantly, human IgG can
fix guinea pig complement and human IgG binds to guinea pig
Fcγ receptors with similar affinity compared with human re-
ceptors (18). These observations support the use of the guinea
pig model for studying the efficacy of antibodies with human
constant regions (e.g., chimeric or fully human mAbs). The dif-
ference in efficacy between IgG and F(ab′)2 reported by Kenyon
et al. is consistent with a growing body of evidence with a variety
of viruses suggesting classic neutralization of free virus (i.e.,
antibody bound to virus sterically hinders binding to, fusion with,
or internalization by a host target cell) may not be the primary
mechanism by which anti-viral mAbs function in vivo, and that
Fcγ receptor-mediated immune functions play a pivotal role (14,
15, 19–21). Although all three chimeric mAbs contained the
same human Fc isotype (IgG1), the protective efficacy directly
correlated with virus neutralization. This observation would
suggest that either affinity directly correlates with neutralization
for these three mAbs or that optimal protection in vivo requires
both Fc-mediated immune functions as well as effective neu-
tralization of free virus.
Consistent with previous reports (9), neurological involvement
was observed in treated animals that experienced a delay to
death, with hind leg paralysis the most commonly observed sign.
None of the animals that received J199 on day 6 after infection
had JUNV antigen detectable in the brain by immunohisto-
chemistry (Table 1), suggesting that the mAb treatment was able
to prevent infection of the central nervous system (CNS).
However, when mAb treatment was delayed to day 7 or 9, 60%
(3 of 5) and 100% (2 of 2) of animals, respectively, had JUNV
antigen detected in brain tissue. These data indicate that viral
access to the CNS occurs between days 6 and 9 after infection in
the guinea pig model and is associated with a reduction in the
benefit of mAb therapy (Fig. 3). These findings are consistent
with clinical experience treating patients with immune plasma,
although the treatment window appears to be greater in humans;
treatment within 8 d after initial symptoms (as opposed to 7 d after
exposure in the guinea pig) is generally successful (5) (Fig. 5).
In humans, neurological involvement (late neurologic syndrome
or LNS) is observed in a small percentage (∼10%) of patients
treated with immune plasma, but has not been reported in
patients who recovered without antibody treatment (22). Un-
like the lethal nature of CNS involvement in the guinea pig
model, LNS is not fatal in humans, although it is associated with
significant morbidity. Serum IgG crosses the blood–brain barrier

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
 (BBB) but is found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at 0.1–0.01% the
concentration found in serum (23, 24); clinical experience and
testing in the guinea pig model indicate that the reduced con-
centration is insufficient for therapeutic benefit. However, in one
report in which guinea pigs were infected intracerebrally with a
less virulent JUNV strain (XJ-44), a survival benefit was dem-
onstrated by systemic treatment with immune serum on days
0 and 6 (9), suggesting the potential for antibodies to have a
positive effect after the virus has breached the BBB. Increasing
the permeability of the BBB to mAbs and other protein thera-
peutics is a highly active field of research in the pharmaceutical
industry (25).
A comparison of the efficacy of the different agents evaluated
historically in the guinea pig model (Table 3) illustrates that
antibody-based interventions are superior to the broad-spectrum
agents that have been tested, providing a greater survival benefit
and a greater therapeutic window. Indeed, recent studies have
highlighted the potential of mAbs for intervening late in viral
disease (26–29), even under conditions of high viral load. mAbs
are generally more potent than broad-spectrum antivirals, but
because of their high specificity, mAbs sacrifice broad-spectrum
activity. For example, the JUNV mAbs described here do not
cross-react with Machupo (10), a related arenavirus. In instances
where broadly neutralizing mAbs cannot be identified, combin-
ing mAbs of different specificities into a mixture offers a
promising approach to develop a drug with high specificity and
broad-spectrum activity.
The data presented here suggest mAbs could be an efficacious
replacement for immune plasma in AHF therapy. Additional
virology studies must be performed including characterizing
J199’s activity against a selection of clinical isolates (sequences
of JUNV GPs in public databases have ≥97% identity) and
examining the propensity of the mAb to select for functional
escape mutants. Although J199 is at an early development stage
for identifying clinical dosing, a preliminary estimate may be
gleaned from clinical dosing with immune plasma, which is based
on the neutralizing titer of the donor plasma (4). The currently
recommended clinical dose is 3000 therapeutic units (TUs)
(TU = mL × 1/PRN80 titer). With the high neutralization potency
of J199 representing ∼3,333 TUs per mg, dosage for a 70-kg adult
equates to 63 mg of J199. Commercial prices of most FDA-
licensed mAb products range from $2–10/mg (30, 31), suggesting
the commercial cost of treatment using a mAb like J199 could be
under $200 with current manufacturing processes, and even less
costly in the future given continuing improvements with the
pharmacoeconomics of traditional and novel manufacturing
systems. Thus, mAb therapy of AHF appears to be technically
and economically feasible.

and J202 were synthesized (Life Technologies) and subsequently cloned into
plant expression vectors (TMV and PVX; Icon Genetics) containing codon-
optimized human kappa and human IgG1 constant regions followed by
transformation into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain ICF320 (Icon Genet-
ics). N. benthamiana plants genetically modified to produce highly homog-
enous mammalian N-glycans of the GnGn glycoform (13) were grown for
4 wk in an enclosed growth room (20–23 °C) and used for vacuum infiltration
as described (16). Seven days after infiltration, the mAb was extracted from
the leaf tissue and purified via protein A chromatography (16), then passed
through an Acrodisc Unit with Mustang Q Membrane (Pall Life Sciences) by
using a syringe for endotoxin reduction. Endotoxin levels were measured with
Endosafe PTS (Charles River) and were less than 150 EU/mg. N-glycan analysis
was performed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spec-
trometry (LC-ESI-MS) of tryptic glycopeptides (32). In short, bands that corre-
spond to the heavy chain in Coomassie-stained SDS/PAGEs were excised,
S-alkylated, digested with trypsin, and subsequently analyzed by LC-ESI-MS.
Plaque Reduction Neutralization Assay. The mAbs were serially diluted
threefold in infection medium (MEM supplemented with 1% FBS, L-gln; Pen/
Strep) starting at 200 μg/mL. Junín virus strain Candid #1 (JUNV) was diluted in
infection medium to 2,000 pfu/mL. Each dilution of the antibodies was
mixed with an equal volume of JUNV to achieve a final concentration of
100 μg/mL and 100 pfu of JUNV. A virus-only control was incubated with
medium alone. The dilutions were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a hu-
midified CO2 atmosphere. Vero cells seeded in 24-well plates to near con-
fluency were infected with the dilutions for 1 h before 0.8% methylcellulose
was added as overlay. After 8 d, plaques were visualized by staining the cell
monolayer with crystal violet in 5% (vol/vol) glutaraldehyde. Effective con-
centrations 50 and 80 (EC50 and EC80) were calculated (μg/mL) relative to the
virus-only control by using 4PL curve fit (XLfit model 205).
Guinea Pig Model. JUNV strain Romero (P3235) was obtained from Thomas
Ksiazek (Galveston National Laboratory; GNL). Animal studies were
completed under BSL-4 biocontainment at the GNL and were approved by
the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) Institutional Laboratory

Presentation of AHF in guinea pigs and humans. Systemically in-
fected guinea pigs typically are asymptomatic for 7–14 d and then show a
rapid decline to death within 0–3 d. In humans, infections, likely transmitted
mucosally, are asymptomatic for 4–21 d, followed by a week of flu-like
symptoms, and another week of either improvement or further decline.

 Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with state and federal stat-
utes and regulations relating to experiments involving animals and the In-
stitutional Biosafety Committee. Female outbred Hartley guinea pigs (351–400 g)
were purchased from Charles River Laboratories and subsequently quarantined
and acclimatized before JUNV challenge. Transponders for temperature re-
cording were implanted before the acclimatization period. Individual animals
were infected with ∼1,000 pfu of JUNV by i.p. injection. mAbs were administered
i.p. in volumes of 0.8–0.9 mL. Studies were concluded 28, 30, or 40 d after in-
fection. JUNV titration was performed by conventional plaque assay on Vero E6
cells from plasma collected from guinea pigs at various times after infection (33).
In brief, increasing 10-fold dilutions of the samples were adsorbed to Vero E6
monolayers in duplicate wells (200 μL). The limit of detection was 25 pfu/mL.
Histopathology was performed on liver, spleen, and brain tissue by using
H&E staining and immunohistochemistry. Specific anti-JUNV immunore-
activity was detected by using an anti-JUNV primary antibody (kindly
provided by Thomas Ksiazek) at a 1:1600 dilution or 60 min. The tissues
were processed for immunohistochemistry by using the Dako Autostainer.
Secondary used was biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG at 1:1600 for 30 min
followed by Dako LSAB2 streptavidin-HRP (K1016) for 30 min. Slides were
developed with Dako DAB chromagen (K3468) for 5 min and counter-
stained with Harris Hematoxylin for 1 min. Survival curves were analyzed
with the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test by using Prism (Version 5.0d).
Data and Materials Availability. Chimeric anti-JUNV mAbs can be obtained
through a Material Transfer Agreement with Mapp.
