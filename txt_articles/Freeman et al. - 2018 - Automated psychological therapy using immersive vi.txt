Summary
Background Engaging, interactive, and automated virtual reality (VR) treatments might help solve the unmet needs of 
individuals with mental health disorders. We tested the efficacy of an automated cognitive intervention for fear of 
heights guided by an avatar virtual coach (animated using motion and voice capture of an actor) in VR and delivered 
with the latest consumer equipment.
Methods We did a randomised trial of automated VR versus usual care. We recruited adults aged older than 18 years 
with a fear of heights by radio advertisements in Oxfordshire, UK. We diagnosed fear of heights if participants scored 
more than 29 on the Heights Interpretation Questionnaire (HIQ). We randomly allocated participants by computer in 
a 1:1 ratio to either automated VR delivered in roughly six 30-min sessions administered about two to three times a 
week over a 2-week period (intervention group) or to usual care (control group). Randomisation was stratified by 
severity of fear of heights. The research team, who were unaware of the random allocation, administered three fear-
of-height assessments, at baseline (0 weeks), at the end of treatment (2 weeks), and at follow-up (4 weeks). The 
primary outcome measure was HIQ score (range 16–80, with higher scores indicating greater severity). This trial is 
registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN11898283.
Findings Between Nov 25, 2017, and Feb 27, 2018, 100 individuals were enrolled and underwent randomisation, of 
whom 49 were assigned to the VR treatment group and 51 to the control group. All participants completed the 4-week 
follow-up. The mean total treatment time in VR was 124·43 min (SD 34·23). Compared with participants in the 
control group, the VR treatment reduced fear of heights at the end of treatment (mean change score –24·5 [SD 13·1] 
in the VR group vs –1·2 [7·3] in the control group; adjusted difference –24·0, 95% CI –27·7 to –20·3; Cohen’s d=2·0; 
p<0·0001). The benefit was maintained at follow-up (mean change score –25·1 [SD 13·9] in the VR group vs 
–1·5 [7·8] in the control group; adjusted difference –24·3, 95% CI –27·9 to –20·6; Cohen’s d=2·0; p<0·0001). The 
number needed to treat to at least halve the fear of heights was 1·3. No adverse events were reported.
Interpretation Psychological therapy delivered automatically by a VR coach can produce large clinical benefits. 
Evidence-based VR treatments have the potential to greatly increase treatment provision for mental health disorders.

Introduction
Mental health disorders are very common and encompass 
great personal and societal costs, but far too few people 
receive the best treatments. For example, in the UK, one 
adult in six meets criteria for a common mental health 
disorder but most of these individuals do not receive 
treatment.1 People who do receive treatment are more 
likely to be given psychotropic medication than a 
psychological intervention. Yet, for many common 
mental health conditions, particularly anxiety disorders, 
evidence-based psychological treatments are both the 
best treatment option2 and the preference of patients.3 
However, increasing the provision of psychological 
treatment is difficult. Therapists need to be trained and 
then adhere competently to evidence-based treatment 
protocols. Moreover, the best psychological treatments 
are not simply so-called talking therapies but take the 
form of direct active learning and coaching in real-world 
situations, whereas most therapists typically have little 
time for sessions outside the clinic. This situation results 
in high service pressures and unmet needs of patients.
Immersive virtual reality (VR) has the potential to 
substantially increase access to the best psychological 
interventions. First, treatments can be automated and 
provided in VR, so a therapist does not need to be 
present. Automated treatment delivered using VR 
consumer hardware could become a low-cost way of 
providing effective interventions at scale. Second, VR can 
deliver the most powerful element of direct therapeutic 
intervention—ie, direct coaching in everyday situations 
that trouble patients. This element is all too frequently 
missing in clinics. By putting on a headset, patients can

be taken immediately into various situations, graded in 
difficulty, that they find cause psychological distress. 
Third, in VR, patients are willing to go into situations 
that trouble them and try alternative ways of responding, 
because they know it is a simulation. However, the 
learning transfers to the real world.4 Therapeutic 
intervention is therefore faster. Moreover, the engaging 
and entertaining nature of VR could result in higher 
treatment uptake than with conventional treatment. VR 
has been used successfully over the past 25 years for 
assessment, understanding, and treatment of mental 
health dis 
orders.5 The increased accessibility and 
affordability of VR mean that this technique is now ready 
to move from specialist laboratories into clinics.
Previous research using VR for treatment of mental 
health disorders has relied on having a therapist present, 
typically to deliver exposure therapy. Effect sizes for 
VR-assisted therapy are usually large (Cohen’s d=1·1).6 
The first application of VR to mental health difficulties 
was for treating fear of heights,7 which is the most 
common phobia. One in five people report having had a 
strong unreasonable fear of heights during their lifetime, 
and one in 20 people reach diagnostic criteria for 
acrophobia.8 One of the largest trials for this disorder 
randomly allocated 33 people with a fear of heights to 
three 1-h sessions of either exposure in vivo or VR 
exposure—in both cases delivered by a therapist.9 Both 
treatments were equally effective and the benefits 
remained 6 months later. The therapeutic effects of VR 
exposure for fear of heights persist for at least a year.10
We aimed to automate the provision of a psychological 
intervention for fear of heights by programming a virtual 
coach to act as the therapist in VR. Our therapeutic 
approach is cognitive, focusing on the evaluation of 
threat predictions while dropping defensive behaviours, 
to develop memories of safety that counteract fear 
associations. The treatment is delivered using inexpen-
sive consumer VR equipment. We postulated that, 
compared with usual care (in effect, no treatment), a 
large treatment benefit (reduction in fear of heights) 
would be seen with the VR intervention immediately 
after treatment (primary hypothesis) and that this benefit 
would persist after treatment had been completed 
(secondary hypothesis).
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a single-blind, parallel group, randomised 
controlled, superiority trial comparing automated VR 
with usual care. The control condition was usual care so 
that we did not interfere with any other type of help that 
the individual might have been receiving. In effect, this 
was equivalent to receiving no treatment for fear of 
heights. At the end of the trial, control participants were 
offered the opportunity to have the VR treatment.
We recruited people with a fear of heights by 
advertisements on local radio (Oxfordshire, UK). 
Inclusion criteria were that a participant had to be older 
than 18 years and have a fear of heights corresponding to 
a Heights Interpretation Questionnaire (HIQ)11 score of 
more than 29. We used the same cutoff as was used in 
the treatment trial by Arroll and colleagues,12 which 
indicates at least a moderate fear of heights. We excluded 
people if they were currently receiving a psychological 
treatment for fear of heights, had photosensitive epilepsy, 
or had either no stereoscopic vision or balance problems.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
At the beginning of 2017, we searched PubMed with no 
restrictions on date for all published work in the English 
language on use of virtual reality (VR) to assess, understand, and 
treat mental health problems. The general search terms were 
(“virtual reality” OR “immersive virtual reality”) AND 
(“assessment”, “treatment”, “research”, “study”, “experiment”, 
OR “understanding”) AND ([disorder-specific terms]). Our search 
retrieved 285 empirical papers. Over the past 25 years, VR has 
been used to aid therapist-delivered psychological interventions, 
principally exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. 
Meta-analyses indicate that treatment effect sizes using VR for 
anxiety disorders, including fear of heights, are large 
(Cohen’s d=1·1). However, VR-assisted therapy has only been 
delivered in a few places, because of the specialist equipment 
that is needed and the reliance on a skilled therapist to provide 
the psychological expertise. We found no reports of automated 
VR being used to treat mental health problems. We updated our 
search of PubMed on May 14, 2018, with no restrictions by 
language, with the terms (“VR” OR “virtual reality”) AND 
(“treatment”) AND (“mental health”) AND (“automated”, 
“self-guided”, OR “automatic”). We did not retrieve any further 
research.
Added value of this study
Our study comprised 100 individuals who self-referred for 
therapy. We showed that psychological treatment for fear of 
heights can be automated using immersive VR. Automation 
was delivered via a virtual coach, rather than a therapist, which 
guided participants through a series of graded exercises beside 
virtual heights that could facilitate cognitive change. 
Participants interacted with the virtual coach to tailor the 
treatment. The clinical effectiveness in our study was at least as 
good as face-to-face therapy.
Implications of all the available evidence
Automated treatment delivered using VR consumer hardware 
could become a low-cost way of providing effective 
interventions at scale. Clinical testing is needed to ascertain 
whether automation of psychological treatment works for 
other mental disorders.

The study received ethics approval from the University 
of Oxford Medical Sciences Inter-Divisional ethics 
committee. All participants gave written informed 
consent for trial participation. No changes to methods 
were made after the trial began.
Randomisation and masking
Randomisation was done by an automated online system 
developed by the University of Oxford Primary Care 
Clinical Trials Unit. Participants were randomly allocated 
in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by fear of height severity (moderate 
[HIQ score 30–55] or severe [HIQ score 56–80]) and 
using randomised permuted block sizes of four and 
eight. The research assistant who gathered follow-up 
data was unaware of the random allocation, and masking 
was not broken.
Procedures
After a potential participant contacted the study team, we 
asked them to complete the HIQ online. If they scored 
above the threshold (HIQ score >29), we checked 
inclusion and exclusion criteria over the telephone. 
Participants needed to score above the HIQ threshold 
again when they attended for the baseline assessment 
(and were excluded before randomisation if they did not). 
All assessments were done at the study centre 
(Oxford VR, Oxford, UK). At baseline, we obtained basic 
demographic data and assessed participants with the 
DSM-513 to see if they met criteria for acrophobia. We 
also asked participants if they were receiving any 
treatment for fear of heights.
The VR intervention consisted of a software application 
called Now I Can Do Heights, which was intended by 
Oxford VR to help users with acrophobia overcome their 
fear of heights. The application is intended for use by 
adults older than 18 years and was designed to be used 
without a supporting therapist, although it can be 
used alongside a therapist or in a clinical setting if 
needed. The application is a CE-marked class I active 
medical device (device code Z301 [standalone software]), 
in conformity with the essential requirements and provi-
sions of EC directive 93/42/EEC (medical devices). The 
software was developed using Unity3D (version 5.6.0f3 
[64-bit]; Unity Technologies, San Francisco, CA, USA) 
and delivered using a gaming personal computer 
(Chillblast Fusion Strix Gaming PC, Intel Core i7-7700K 
processor, 16 GB DDR4 3000 MHz memory, ASUS 
GeForce GTX 1080 8GB graphics card, 500 GB M.2 solid 
state drive/3 TB hard disc drive; Chillblast, Poole, UK) 
and the HTC Vive (HTC Corporation, New Taipei City, 
Taiwan)—a consumer VR head-mounted display that has 
associated hand controllers and headset tracking. 
Participants also wore headphones with a microphone 
(Creative Labs Sound Blaster Tactic3d Rage Wireless; 
Creative Labs, Jurong East, Singapore).
The treatment was designed to be administered in 
roughly six 30-min VR sessions over a period of 2 weeks. 
We allowed a degree of flexibility in treatment length 
because individuals differ in the speed with which they 
progress. Participants underwent the treatment in the 
office of Oxford VR, with a graduate psychologist in 
the room to help the participant put on the headset and 
for basic safety reasons. Programme sessions ran auto 
-
matically. At the beginning of every session, the 
participant’s virtual body was calibrated by the software 
system reading data from head and hand VR trackers. 
Participants who were assigned the VR intervention 
undertook the treatment while standing up, and they 
could walk in the virtual environ 
ment.
At the beginning of the first session, the participant 
had an initial assessment with the virtual coach in a 
virtual office. The virtual coach was animated using 
motion capture from an actor and voiced by the same 
person. The coach gave the participant basic information 
about fear of heights and its treatment from a cognitive 
perspective (eg, “The reason we’re afraid of heights is 
because we think something bad is going to happen. And 
that makes us feel anxious. Then we end up avoiding 
heights because they feel so scary. But I’ll show you how 
to look at those thoughts in a new way.”), then asked the 
participant a series of questions about their key fear 
about heights (eg, fear of falling, fear of the building 
collapsing, fear of throwing oneself off) and obtained 
ratings of belief conviction (rated on a scale from 
0 [“I don’t believe it will happen”] to 10 [“I’m absolutely 
certain it will happen”]). The basic mechanism of 
treatment was for individuals to find out how accurate 
their fears were. Hence, throughout the programme, 
participants were encouraged by the virtual coach to find 
out how safe they were and to put their expectations to 
the test (eg, “Remember: we’re exploring here. We’re 
testing out our expectations. We’re discovering what 
happens when we venture into a situation we’d normally 
try to avoid.”). The virtual coach also explained how 
this learning depended on dropping safety-seeking 
behaviours (eg, “Many people try to deal with their fear of 
heights by using defences. They put up barriers between 
themselves and what they fear. The most obvious one is 
simply avoiding heights. But there are lots of subtler 
defences: closing your eyes when you’re up high or not 
looking down, repeating a comforting phrase to yourself, 
taking off your shoes, holding on to something. We need 
to lower these defences. They can make us feel better in 
the short term. But they prevent us truly engaging with 
the situations that make us anxious—and stop us 
learning just how much we can achieve without them.”). 
The treatment was not designed as exposure therapy 
(ie, participants were not asked to remain in situations 
until anxiety reduced) but as repeated behavioural 
experiment tests (ie, to learn that they were safer than 
they had thought). Throughout the sessions, participants’ 
responses to questions from the virtual coach were given 
either by means of voice recognition technology (via a 
microphone attached to the headphones) or by using a

virtual watch. Belief ratings were repeated within VR at 
the end of every treatment session.
After the initial assessment stage (during the first 
session), the treatment began while still within the 
first session. The virtual coach took the participant to 
the atrium of a large ten-storey office complex. The 
environment featured many height cues (eg, balls in the 
air, people moving about). The participant then chose 
on which of the first five floors to begin the activities (ie, 
participants could not access higher than the fifth floor 
until later sessions). Guided throughout by the virtual 
coach, tasks were undertaken on every floor to enable 
the participant to find out whether his or her fears 
were accurate. Tasks were randomised across all 
the remaining floors for every participant, but were 
weighted towards the easiest tasks first (eg, a barrier 
gradually lowering) whereas harder tasks came later 
(eg, going out on a platform from the floor into the 
atrium space). Many tasks were designed to be engaging 
for participants (eg, rescuing a cat from a tree, playing a 
xylophone near the edge of the floor, throwing balls over 
the edge of the floor). The virtual coach described 
the tasks to the participant, provided empathic encour-
agement, repeated key learning points, and sought feed-
back on whether the participant felt safer than before. 
The participant could decide to repeat tasks or move up 
to the next floor. At the end of the session, the participant 
was brought back down to the atrium ground level and 
the coach would ask for belief ratings for the height 
threat and encourage the participant to try real heights 
between sessions. The sessions were saved so that the 
participant could begin the next session where they had 
left off. Pictures from the VR treatment can be seen in 
the appendix.
Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was the HIQ,11 which is a 
16-item self-report questionnaire. The scale strongly 
predicts distress, anxiety, and avoidance of real heights 
and has high internal consistency and convergent 
validity with other fear of heights measures.11 We asked 
participants to rate anxious fears (eg, that they will fall, 
faint, or hurt themselves) when imagining two different 
height situations (ie, being on a ladder against a two-
storey house and on the balcony of a 15th floor building). 
Scores can range from 16 to 80, with higher scores 
indicating a greater severity of fear of heights. Internal 
reliability of the scale at baseline was very high 
(Cronbach’s α=0·91).
Secondary outcome measures were the acrophobia 
questionnaire (AQ)14 and the Improving Access to 
Psycho 
logical Therapies (IAPT) phobia scale–avoidance.15 
The AQ is a 40-item self-report questionnaire. For 
20 different height situations (eg, diving off the low 
board at a swimming pool, riding a Ferris wheel, walking 
on a footbridge over a motorway), we asked participants 
to rate their level of anxiety (on a scale from 0 to 6) and 
level of avoidance (scale from 0 to 2). We measured the 
AQ total score and two AQ subscale scores (anxiety and 
avoidance). Anxiety scores can range between 0 and 120 
and avoidance scores between 0 and 40, with total AQ 
scores ranging between 0 and 160.14 Higher scores 
indicate a greater severity of fear of heights. The internal 
reliability of the scale at baseline was very high 
(Cronbach’s α=0·90).
The IAPT phobia scale–avoidance is a single-item scale 
taken from the routine outcome measures administered 
by the UK National Health Service’s IAPT programme, 
which treats common emotional disorders.15 We asked 
participants to rate their avoidance of heights on a scale 
from 0 (would not avoid it) to 8 (always avoid it). Higher 
scores indicated greater avoidance.
We also recorded the occurrence of any known serious 
adverse events in participants, which we defined as

death, suicide attempts, serious violent incidents, 
admissions to psychiatric hospital, and formal complaints 
about the intervention. We used the Simulator Sickness 
Questionnaire (SSQ)16 to assess levels of discomfort 
provoked by a VR session. The SSQ is the most com-
monly used assessment of VR simulator sickness, but it 
was not developed in the context of the treatment of 
anxiety, and the 16 items in the scale overlap completely 
with symptoms of anxiety—eg, increased salivation, 
sweating, nausea, vertigo, burping, headache, blurred 
vision, and feeling dizzy. We administered the SSQ four 
times: before and after the first and last VR treatment 
sessions. Participants rated the items for how much they 
were experienced at that time, on a 4-point scale 
(from 0 [none] to 3 [very strong]). We used a simple raw 
total score of all items,17,18 because we wanted to see 
absolute levels and potential increases in discomfort. The 
total score, therefore, can range between 0 and 48, with 
higher scores indicating greater discomfort.
Statistical analysis
A full statistical analysis plan was agreed before the trial 
analysis (appendix). We did analyses with Stata 
version 15.1. Analyses were done by intention to treat at 
the end of the trial and were validated by a second 
statistician.
Because effect sizes for VR-assisted therapy for anxiety 
disorders are typically large (Cohen’s d=1·1),6 our target 
sample size was 100 individuals, which would enable the 
trial to detect a standardised treatment effect of 
0·65 (medium) with 90% power, and of 0·57 (medium) 
with 80% power, at a significance level of 0·05. These 
treatment effects amount to differences between treat-
ments on the HIQ of 7·6 and 6·6, respectively, based on 
an SD of 11·7 (taken from the mean of the baseline SDs 
of the two groups reported by Arroll and colleagues).12
We analysed continuous outcomes using a linear 
mixed effects model, which included a random effect for 
participant to account for repeated measures at 2 weeks 
and 4 weeks. We included as fixed effects treatment 
group, assessment timepoint (as a categorical variable), 
baseline score for the outcome scale, and the interaction 
between treatment group and assessment timepoint 
(to allow estimation of a treatment effect at each of the 
two timepoints). In the secondary outcome analyses, we 
also included baseline HIQ scores as a fixed effect 
because stratification was based on this variable. We did 
not need techniques for missing data. We present results 
as mean differences in scores between treatment groups, 
with 95% CIs and associated two-sided p values. 
We calculated effect sizes using Cohen’s d, dividing the 
treatment effect by the shared SD at baseline. We also 
ascertained the number needed to treat (NNT) to reduce 
the fear of heights by at least 25%, 50%, and 75%, and to 
below the study entry criterion.
This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 
number ISRCTN11898283.
Role of the funding source
Oxford VR own the automated treatment and helped 
design the trial. The National Institute for Health Research 
Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre funded 
the randomisation programme and statistical analysis. 
Some of the authors are employed by the funders and 
contributed to the report. The decision to submit the trial 
results for publication was agreed during trial registration, 
before the trial began. The corresponding author had full 
access to all data in the study and had final responsibility 
for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Between October, 2017, and February, 2018, 189 people 
self-referred to the study, of whom 89 were excluded after 
screening and assessment (figure 1). Thus, 100 participants 
underwent randomisation, which began on Nov 25, 2017, 
and ended on Feb 27, 2018. 49 participants were allocated 
the VR intervention and 51 were assigned to the control 
group. Final data were gathered on April 6, 2018.
Participants had been experiencing a fear of heights for 
a mean of 30 years (SD 14·47). No participant was 
receiving any other form of help for their fear of heights. 
90 participants met diagnostic criteria for acrophobia. 
Treatment groups were balanced across the variables 
(table 1), except for gender, with a higher proportion of 
women assigned to the control group. Scores on the HIQ 
were associated positively with scores on the AQ (r=0·68; 
p<0·0001) and with scores on the IAPT phobia scale 
(r=0·54; p<0·0001).
Uptake of the VR treatment was very high. 47 (96%) of 
49 people attended at least one VR session. The mean 
number of treatment sessions attended by these 
47 participants was 4·66 (SD 1·27). The mean length of

a treatment session was 26·8 min (SD 2·7). The mean 
total VR treatment time for these individuals was 
124·43 min (SD 34·23). 44 (90%) people had a full 
course of the VR intervention (ie, they completed all the 
treatment exercises), which comprised three (n=4), 
four (n=18), five (n=8), six (n=12), seven (n=1), or 
eight (n=1) treatment sessions. Three (6%) people did 
not complete the intervention, with two people finding 
the VR sessions too difficult (attending three and 
four sessions) and one person unable to attend further 
appointment times (attending one session).
All participants were followed up at all timepoints 
(baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks) and no outcome data were 
missing. Table 2 summarises the mean scores of the 
primary and secondary outcome measures at every 
assessment point for each treatment group and the 
adjusted differences between groups. Participants allocated 
to the VR treatment group had very large reductions in 
scores on the three fear-of-heights assessments from 
baseline to 4 weeks, whereas scores for the control group 
remained stable (figure 2).
For the primary outcome analysis, the mean change in 
the HIQ total score at 2 weeks was –24·5 (SD 13·1) in 
participants allocated the VR intervention and –1·2 (7·3) 
in the control group. The adjusted difference in the 
treatment effect was –24·0 (95% CI –27·7 to –20·3; d=2·0; 
p<0·0001), in favour of the VR intervention (table 2). 
The mean change in the HIQ total score at 4 weeks was 
–25·1 (SD 13·9) in the VR treatment group and 
–1·5 (7·8) in the control group (adjusted difference in 
treatment effect –24·3, 95% CI –27·9 to –20·6; d=2·0; 
p<0·0001; table 2). 49 (100%) participants in the VR group 
showed a reduction in fear of heights on the HIQ, with 
the mean reduction being 68·0% (SD 26·6). By the follow-
up timepoint, 34 (69%) of 49 people in the VR treatment 
group fell below the trial’s fear of heights entry criterion 
on the HIQ, compared with none of 51 people in the 
control group (risk difference 0·61, 95% CI 0·48–0·75; 
NNT 1·6). In the VR group, 25 (51%) participants showed 
a reduction of 75% or greater (risk difference 0·45, 95% CI 
0·31–0·59; NNT 2·2), 38 (78%) had a reduction of 50% or 
greater (0·78, 0·66–0·89; NNT 1·3), and 44 (90%) had a 
reduction of 25% or greater (0·86, 0·76–0·96; NNT 1·2). 
No participants in the control group showed a reduction 
of 75% or greater or 50% or greater, and nine (18%) had a 
reduction of 25% or greater. The mean reduction in the 
fear-of-heights score on the HIQ in the control group was 
3·3% (SD 23·0). Outcomes were consistent with 
participant-described benefits of treatment (panel).
We did preplanned subgroup analyses by gender 
(appendix). Gender had an independent effect on several 
outcomes but no significant interaction terms were noted 
in the models between gender and treatment group (ie, 
gender did not moderate treatment effects). In both 
treatment groups, men seemed to do slightly better than 
women. In response to the imbalance observed in gender 
across the two treatment groups, we also did sensitivity

tests adjusting the outcome analyses for gender (appendix). 
Adjusting the treatment differences for gender did not 
change the conclusions, with large treatment effects still 
shown on all measures at all timepoints (data not shown).
No adverse events were reported by any participant in 
either treatment group. Levels of discomfort (as assessed 
by the SSQ) were very low before entering VR for the first 
time (n=47; mean total score 1·60 [SD 1·88]) and 
discomfort increased only slightly after being in VR 
(n=47; mean total score 3·81 [SD 3·80]; mean increase 
2·21, 95% CI 1·24–3·18; p<0·0001). Before the last 
session of VR, levels of discomfort were also very low 
(n=37; mean total score 1·21 [SD 2·27]) and, again, 
increased only slightly after being in VR (n=37; mean 
total score 2·57 [SD 3·98]; mean increase 1·35, 95% CI 
0·55–2·16; p=0·002).
Discussion
The findings of our large randomised controlled trial 
show that an automated psychological intervention 
delivered by immersive VR is highly effective for 
reduction of fear of heights. All participants were followed 
up at every timepoint, meaning that the treatment effect 
estimates were unbiased by missing data. Treatment 
uptake was very high, indicating that the VR intervention 
was well received. Levels of discomfort after a VR session 
were very low, particularly since trial participants were 
facing their feared situation.
Findings of a meta-analysis indicated a mean effect size 
reduction in phobias with therapist-assisted exposure 
treatment (using real heights) of d=1·1;19 our automated 
VR treatment produced effect sizes that greatly exceeded 
this value (d=2·0). Therefore, the treatment effects 
produced were at least as good as—and most likely 
better—than the best psychological intervention delivered 
face-to-face with a therapist.
The initial cost of software development was reasonably 
high, with a team comprising psychologists, programmers, 
script writers, and an actor working intensively over 
approximately 6 months, but subsequent costs for this 
treatment are very low, with no need for a therapist to be 
present and inexpensive consumer VR hardware used. 
As VR becomes more widespread in households, such a 
treatment could be used at home in the future. Our view is 
that automated immersive VR has the potential to increase 
access to the best psychological interventions radically.
Our trial has several limitations. First, we do not know 
how representative our participants are of the wider 
population of people with acrophobia. Second, we relied 
on established acrophobia questionnaires and did not test 
behaviour at real heights. Third, we did not test long-term 
outcomes of the VR treatment, because previous studies 
of VR-assisted therapy have shown that reductions in 
anxiety can last several years.20,21 Fourth, since most people 
do not receive treatment for a fear of heights, the clinical 
question addressed in the trial was the pragmatic one of 
how effective in total was the VR treatment against the 
absence of other treatment. Therefore, we can only 
conclude that the automated VR treatment produces 
large reductions in fear of heights, but we cannot pinpoint 
Panel: Participants’ comments about VR treatment
“What I’m noticing is that in day-to-day life I’m much less 
averse to edges, and steps, and heights, and I’m noticing in 
myself that when I’m doing the VR and outside I’m able to say 
‘Hello’ to the edge instead of bracing against it and backing up. 
When I’m doing the VR I’m, as best as I’m able to, being open 
and curious around me as much as I can and noticing how the 
anxiety feels in my body, and then noticing that it goes really 
quickly now. So, when I’ve always got anxious about an edge 
I could feel the adrenaline in my legs, that fight/flight thing; 
that’s not happening as much now. I’m still getting a bit of a 
reaction to it, both in VR and outside as well, but it’s much 
more brief, and I can then feel my thighs soften up as I’m not 
bracing up against that edge. I feel as if I’m making enormous 
progress, and feel very happy with what I’ve gained.”
“Everything I thought it was going to be, it wasn’t. 
I anticipated it was just going to be like a game, it was going 
to be something that wasn’t going to arouse my senses. 
I found myself even after the third floor, fourth floor, going 
up, feeling nervous, anxious about what’s about to happen 
next. It definitely pushed the limits in terms of what I thought 
I would be able to achieve, and then got me to go past that. 
Now that it’s done, after my fourth session, I have to say I feel 
better for it. I’ve already been experimenting in the weeks to 
see what it would be like in a real-life environment. And what I 
would like to say is that it’s absolutely brilliant, honestly, I do 
think it’s made a huge difference. I do think my nervousness 
about heights is definitely a lot better.”
“I’ve just finished my sessions, I did four in total. Last week, 
after my third session, I went up to the Westgate [a shopping 
centre]; the difference in my mental capacity to deal with 
heights was amazing. Previously I wouldn’t go anywhere near 
the edges, I was almost hanging right off, looking vertically 
down. The sessions I’ve had here have given me a lot to think 
about, and certainly with regards to my fear of heights it feels 
like it’s helped a lot. So, very worthwhile doing.”
“I’m 60 years old and I’ve had a fear of heights, an extreme fear 
of heights, all my life. I came to the centre, I’ve had 
three sessions of VR and I’ve already surpassed everything that I 
imagined I could. I didn’t actually think I’d be able to get to what 
is known as level 2 but I’ve achieved that. I am absolutely 
confident that I will be going to several other levels over the 
next week or two. For me, whilst it’s not easy and I can’t say that 
my fear of heights has gone, it has certainly improved and my 
confidence has improved so, so far so good!”

which elements caused the reduction. For example, we do 
not know whether similarly clinically effective automation 
of treatment can occur without use of a virtual coach. 
Fifth, the VR treatment was brief, and it is possible that 
further benefits might occur with a longer duration of 
treatment. Increased effectiveness might also occur with 
integration of the VR treatment into behavioural 
experiments in the real world. We are piloting provision 
of the VR treatment over half a day, and the outcomes are 
similarly encouraging. Finally, the extent to which 
learning from our work will transfer to other mental 
health conditions, particularly those seen in secondary 
care services, is uncertain. Automated treatment of 
anxiety disorders using VR might be a more tractable 
problem than for other disorders. We believe that 
transferability can only be determined by investment in 
high-quality VR treatments that are then tested in clinical 
trials. This endeavour is very important in mental health 
research in view of the potential benefits that might 
result from greatly increasing access to evidence-based 
treat 
ment for mental health disorders.
