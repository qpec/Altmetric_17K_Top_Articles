Background: Stunting affects about one-quarter of children under five worldwide. The pathogenesis of stunting is
poorly understood. Nutritional interventions have had only modest effects in reducing stunting. We hypothe-
sized that insufficiency in essential amino acids may be limiting the linear growth of children.
Methods: We used a targeted metabolomics approach to measure serum amino acids, glycerophospholipids,
sphingolipids, and other metabolites using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 313 children,
aged 12–59 months, from rural Malawi. Children underwent anthropometry.
Findings: Sixty-two percent of the children were stunted. Children with stunting had lower serum concentrations
of all nine essential amino acids (tryptophan, isoleucine, leucine, valine, methionine, threonine, histidine, phenyl-
alanine, lysine) compared with nonstunted children (p b 0.01). In addition, stunted children had significantly
lower serum concentrations of conditionally essential amino acids (arginine, glycine, glutamine), non-essential
amino acids (asparagine, glutamate, serine), and six different sphingolipids compared with nonstunted children.
Stunting was also associated with alterations in serum glycerophospholipid concentrations.
Interpretation: Our findings support the idea that children with a high risk of stunting may not be receiving an
adequate dietary intake of essential amino acids and choline, an essential nutrient for the synthesis of
sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids.

1. Introduction
Stunting affects about one-quarter of children under five years of age
worldwide (Black et al., 2013; UNICEF/World Health Organization/World
Bank Group, 2015). Stunting is considered the best available summary
measure of chronic malnutrition. Child stunting may develop during the
first two years of life and is largely attributed to inadequate nutrition
and infectious diseases (Black et al., 2013). In 2014, there were an esti-
mated 159 million children who were stunted, with nearly all stunted
children living in low-income countries (UNICEF/World Health
Organization/World Bank Group, 2015). Stunting is associated with de-
creased survival, impaired cognitive and motor development, reduced
economic productivity, and higher chance of living in poverty in adult-
hood (Black et al., 2013; Grantham-McGregor et al., 2007). The World
Health Assembly has set a global target of a 40% reduction in the number
of stunted under-five children by 2025 (de Onis et al., 2013). This targeted
reduction in child stunting is included in the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goal #2 (Murray, 2015). Nutritional interventions only
have a modest impact upon stunting and will be insufficient to meet
this goal alone. Even if ten evidence-based nutritional interventions
were all applied at 90% coverage, stunting would be reduced by only
~20% (Bhutta et al., 2013), which falls short of international goals to re-
duce stunting. The pathogenesis of stunting remains poorly understood.
There may be as yet unknown or limiting nutritional factors that contrib-
ute to child stunting.
In the 1950s and 1960s, international organizations were focused on
protein malnutrition in children in developing countries (Semba, 2008).
The emphasis shifted away from proteins to micronutrient malnutrition
in the 1970s (Semba, 2008), under the assumption that most children
received adequate protein. This assumption needs to be re-examined
for several reasons. New evidence shows human growth is controlled
by the master growth regulation pathway, the mechanistic target of

 rapamycin complex C1 (mTORC1) (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012). When
specific amino acids are deficient in the diet, mTORC1 senses amino acid
deficiency and represses protein and lipid synthesis and cellular growth
(Laplante and Sabatini, 2012). The linear growth of children is depen-
dent upon the chondral growth plate (Baron et al., 2015). Bone growth
by the chondral plate is regulated by mTORC1 and the availability of
amino acids, such as the essential amino acid leucine (Kim et al.,
2009). Children at high risk of stunting may have limitations of essential
amino acids in their diet such as tryptophan and lysine (Nuss and
Tanumihardjo, 2011). The amino acid requirements of young children
were not directly established and are currently derived based on a fac-
torial computation (Pillai and Kurpad, 2012). Whether current dietary
recommendations of essential amino acids are sufficient for children
in low-income settings – where infectious diseases are common and
catch-up growth is important – is unclear. The burden of infectious dis-
ease and metabolic needs for immune system activation may partition
limited essential amino acids to support immune function at the ex-
pense of growth (Kampman-van de Hoek et al., 2016).
Recent advances in metabolomics and mass spectrometry now facil-
itate rapid and absolute quantification of serum amino acids and other
metabolites in large epidemiological studies. We hypothesized that
stunted children have decreased concentrations of circulating essential
amino acids and other metabolites. To address this hypothesis, we used
a targeted metabolomics approach to investigate serum amino acids
and other metabolites in a cohort of young children in rural Malawi.
2. Methods
2.1. Study Design and Participants
The study design was cross-sectional. The study subjects consisted of
a community-based sample of 313 children, aged 12–59 months, seen
in six villages (Masika, Makhwira, Mitondo, Mbiza, Chamba, and
Mayaka) in rural southern Malawi in 2011. Children were eligible for
the study if they had no evidence of severe acute malnutrition, congen-
ital or chronic disease, or caretaker-reported diarrhea. The study en-
rolled 540 children, of whom venous blood samples were obtained
from 483 children. A simple random sample of 313 children was used
for the analysis of serum metabolites. Children underwent anthropom-
etry conducted by trained, experienced field workers. Weight was mea-
sured to the nearest 5 g using a digital scale (Seca 334, Chino, CA).
Recumbent length (for children b24 months) or standing height was
measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a rigid height board (Seca 417).
Height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ) and weight-for-height Z-scores were
calculated using World Health Organization growth curves (de Onis
et al., 2012). Stunting was defined as HAZ b −2 (de Onis et al., 2012).
Chichewa-speaking Malawian research nurses obtained written and
oral informed consent from each child's caretaker before enrollment
in the study. Community consent for the study also was obtained from
the village chief and local health officials. The protocol for this study
was approved by the College of Medicine Research Ethics Committee
of the University of Malawi, the Human Research Protection Office of
Washington University in St. Louis, and the Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine Institutional Review Board.
2.2. Measurement of Serum Metabolites
Venous blood was drawn by study nurses and doctors. Serum sam-
ples were processed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen within 4 h of
blood drawing. Cryovials were stored at −80 °C. Sera were not thawed
prior to metabolite measurements. Samples with no hemolysis were
used for the analyses. Serum metabolites were measured in a masked
fashion using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS). Metabolites were extracted and concentrations measured
using the AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit (Biocrates Life Sciences AG, Innsbruck,
Austria) following the manufacturers protocol for a 5500 QTrap (Sciex,
Framingham, MA) mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray
ionization source, a CBM-20A command module, LC-20AB pump, and
a SIL-20AC-HT autosampler, a CTO-10Ac column oven heater (all
Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan), and running with Analyst 1.5.2 software
(Biocrates), as described in detail elsewhere (Schmerler et al., 2012).
The method measured 139 metabolites: 22 amino acids, 3 biogenic
amines, 6 amino acid metabolites, 15 sphingolipids, 8 acylcarnitines,
and 85 glycerophospholipids (lyso-, diacyl-, and acyl-alkyl phosphati-
dylcholines). Glycerophospholipids are differentiated on the basis of
ester and ether bonds in the glycerol moiety. Diacyl or “aa” indicates
that fatty acids are bound with ester bonds at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions
on the glycerol backbone. Acyl-alkyl or “ae” indicates that the fatty acid at
the sn-1 position is bound with an ether bond. The total number of carbon
atoms and double bonds in fatty acid chains is represented by “C x:y”,
where x denotes the number of carbons and y denotes the number of
double bonds. Phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysophosphatidylcholine
(lysoPC), and sphingomyelin (SM), and hydroxysphingomyelin (SM
[OH]) are used in the abbreviations. The MS spectra were evaluated
using Analyst/MetIDQ software (Biocrates). Human serum samples
spiked with standard metabolites were used to monitor the reproducibil-
ity of the assay. Metabolites that were below the limit of quantification
were excluded. The inter-assay and intra-assay coefficients of variation
ranged from 5% to 15% for nearly all analytes.
2.3. Statistical Analysis
The sample size of 313 children was based upon N90% power to de-
tect at least a 10% difference in serum leucine between stunted and non-
stunted children, given a 60% prevalence of stunting, σ = 47 μmol/L
(Reinehr et al., 2015), no matching, α = 0.05, and a two-sided test. Of
all the essential amino acids, we chose leucine for power calculations,
since it is the most well-characterized amino acid sensed by the
mTORC1 pathway (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012; Saxton et al., 2016).
Univariate exploratory data analyses using histograms and boxplots
were used to examine the distribution of serum metabolites. Linear re-
gression was performed of HAZ on serum metabolites in separate
models using one model per metabolite and a combined model with
all metabolites. Bivariate exploratory analyses were used to relate
each metabolite to HAZ and to each other to ensure linear relations be-
tween metabolites and HAZ. Spearman correlations were used to exam-
ine correlations between HAZ and serum metabolites. Wilcoxon rank-
sum test, adjusted by age and gender, was used to compare serum me-
tabolites between stunted and non-stunted children. A Bonferroni ad-
justment to type I error was made to account for the multiple
metabolites, many which are closely correlated, into five general classes
(amino acids, biogenic amines/amino acid metabolites, sphingolipids,
acylcarnitines, glycerophospholipids) so that p-value b 0.01 (=0.05/
5) was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were con-
ducted using R version 3.1.

nificantly lower in stunted compared with non-stunted children.
There were no significant differences in serum proline, tyrosine, ala-
nine, and aspartic acid between children with and without stunting.
Of the biogenic amines and amino acid metabolites, serum ornithine,
taurine, and asymmetric dimethylarginine were significantly lower
in stunted compared with non-stunted children. There were no sig-
nificant differences in serum alpha-aminoadipic acid, kynurenine,
creatinine, spermine, putrescine, symmetric dimethylarginine, and
total dimethylarginine between stunted and non-stunted children.
Serum sphingolipid and acylcarnitine concentrations in children

 The relationship of HAZ with all serum metabolites is summarized in
a volcano plot in Fig. 2. Of the 19 proteinogenic amino acids measured
(cysteine not measured in this assay), 16 amino acids had a significant
positive correlation with HAZ, including eight of nine essential amino
acids (tryptophan, isoleucine, leucine, valine, methionine, threonine,
histidine, lysine), four conditionally essential amino acids (arginine,
glycine, glutamine, tyrosine), and three non-essential amino acids
(asparagine, glutamate, serine). Non-proteinogenic amino acids (citrul-
line, ornithine, taurine) and one amino acid metabolite (creatinine)
had a significant positive association with HAZ. One biogenic amine
(serotonin) had a significant positive association with HAZ. Serum
phenylalanine, proline, alanine, aspartic acid, alpha-aminoadipic
acid, kynurenine, spermine, putrescine, total dimethylarginine, sym-
metric dimethylarginine, and asymmetric dimethylarginine were
not significantly associated with HAZ.
Two serum sphingomyelins (SM [OH] C22:2, SM C18:0) and serum
carnitine had significant positive correlations with HAZ. Seven serum
lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPC a C16:0, lysoPC a C17:0, lysoPC a
C18:0, lysoPC a C18:1, lysoPC a C18:2, lysoPC a C20:3, lyso PC a
C20:4), three serum diacyl-phosphatidylcholines (PC aa C36:6, PC aa
C38:6, PC aa C40:6), and five acyl-alkyl-phosphatidylcholines (PC ae
C34:3, PC ae C36:5, PC ae C38:0, PC ae C38:6, PC ae C40:1) had signifi-
cant positive correlations with HAZ. One lysophosphatidylcholine
(lyso PC a C26:0), seven serum diacyl-phosphatidylcholines (PC aa
C30:0, PC aa C32:0, PC aa C32:1, PC aa C34:1, PC aa C34:2, PC aa C34:3,
PC aa C36:1), and six acyl-alkyl-phosphatidylcholines (PC ae C30:1, PC
ae C34:0, PC ae C34:1, PC ae C36:1, PC ae C36:2, PC ae C38:2) had signif-
icant negative correlations with HAZ.
The Spearman correlations between HAZ and serum amino acids
and biogenic amines, serum sphingolipids and acylcarnitines, and
serum glycerophospholipids are shown in Supplementary Tables 4–6.
Scatterplots and fitted regression curves using natural cubic splines
are shown for the 20 most significant metabolites in Fig. 3.
4. Discussion
The present study shows that stunted children have lower serum
concentrations of all nine essential amino acids. In addition, stunting
was associated with lower circulating levels of three conditionally
essential amino acids, other proteinogenic amino acids, biogenic
amines, amino acid metabolites, sphingomyelins, and with alterations
in glycerophospholipids. As noted, in response to low amino acid avail-
ability, mTORC1 represses synthesis of both proteins and lipids, thus
limiting cell growth (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012). Another amino acid
sensing and growth pathway related to mTORC1 is the general control
nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) pathway (Efeyan et al., 2015; Ye et al.,

 2015). The changes in serum amino acids in the fasting versus non-
fasting states can be detected by nutrient sensing pathways mTORC1
and GCN2 (Efeyan et al., 2015; Laplante and Sabatini, 2012). Thus, the
low serum amino acid concentrations found in these children have the
potential to repress protein and lipid synthesis through mTORC1 and
GCN2 and retard growth. Leucine, a key amino acid sensed by
mTORC1 (Efeyan et al., 2015; Laplante and Sabatini, 2012; Saxton
et al., 2016), was the metabolite with the strongest association with lin-
ear growth in the present study.
Essential amino acids are considered “essential” because they cannot
be synthesized by the body and must be obtained from diet (Wu,
2009). Insufficient intake of essential amino acids could adversely affect
multiple metabolic pathways since they play diverse roles in human
health. Methionine is a precursor to homocysteine, cysteine, and taurine,
and to S-adenosylmethionine, the primary methyl donor in the synthesis
of polyamines (Wu, 2009). Tryptophan is the precursor for niacin and for
serotonin, a neuromediator primarily found in the enterochromaffin cells
of the gut (Wu, 2009). Lysine is the precursor to carnitine and is required
for the structural modification of collagens (Wu, 2009). Threonine is a
major component of secretory mucin 2 that forms the protective mucus
layer of the gut (Wu, 2009). Histidine plays a role in protein methylation,
hemoglobin structure and function, and is a precursor for both histamine
and carnosine (Wu, 2009). Phenylalanine is a precursor for tyrosine, the
substrate for synthesis of catecholamines (Wu, 2009).
Restriction of conditionally essential amino acids in the diet could
also impact health. Arginine serves as a precursor for the synthesis of ni-
tric oxide, creatine, symmetric and asymmetric dimethylarginine, and
polyamines, and is interconvertible with proline and glutamate (Wu,
2009). Glutamine is essential to enterocyte growth and intestinal barri-
er function (Wu, 2009). Glycine plays a role in protein synthesis, syn-
thesis of purines, conjugation of bile acids, as a neurotransmitter in
the central nervous system, and in cytoprotection (Wu, 2009).
In the present study, stunted children had lower serum
sphingomyelins. Sphingomyelins are dominant sphingolipids in
membranes of mammalian cells and are mainly localized to the plas-
ma membrane, especially the outer leaflet, and to the endocytic
recycling compartment and the trans-Golgi network (Slotte, 2013).
Sphingomyelins play a central role in creating lateral structures in
membranes for Toll-like receptors, class A and B scavenger receptors,
and insulin receptors (Slotte, 2013). Sphingomyelins are involved in
cell signaling (Wu, 2009), and T cell activation and differentiation
(Beyersdorf and Müller, 2015). Sphingomyelins are a major lipid
component of myelin and are essential to myelination of the central
nervous system during child development. Myelination of the cen-
tral nervous system is dependent upon the mTORC1 pathway, and
activation of mTORC1 for myelination requires amino acid sufficien-
cy (Lebrun-Julien et al., 2014). The synthesis of sphingomyelins is
closely related with phosphatidylcholines, since the final step in bio-
synthesis of sphingomyelins is dependent upon phosphatidylcho-
lines, the donor of a phosphorylcholine group to ceramide.
In the present study, fourteen phosphatidylcholines were signifi-
cantly lower and fourteen were significantly higher in children with
stunting, which is suggestive of wide alterations in phosphatidylcholine
synthesis or catabolism. Phosphatidylcholines are the most abundant
phospholipid in mammalian cell membranes and the dominant phos-
pholipid circulating in plasma (Fagone and Jackowski, 2013). Cell prolif-
eration, differentiation, and growth are highly dependent upon
phosphatidylcholines, since they serve as the major component of cell
membranes (Fagone and Jackowski, 2013). Phosphatidylcholines are
essential for lipoprotein assembly and secretion by the liver (Cole
et al., 2012), and comprise the main active component of lung surfac-
tant. Phosphatidylcholines and lyso-phosphatidylcholines, which are
derived from phosphatidylcholines, account for N90% of the lipid in
the protective mucus layer in the gut (Johansson et al., 2011). Both
phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins are involved in chondrogen-
esis, a major determinant of linear growth (Baron et al., 2015).
Endochondral bone formation, which plays a key role in linear growth
of bones, requires synthesis of phosphatidylcholines (Kular et al.,
2015; Li et al., 2014).
Phosphatidylcholines are mainly synthesized in the CDP-choline
pathway that begins with the absorption of dietary choline in the
small intestine and involves three enzymatic steps. The second pathway
for phosphatidylcholine synthesis is the phosphatidylethanolamine N-
methyltransferase (PEMT) pathway, which is quantitatively significant
only in liver and not other tissues. Choline is an essential nutrient
since the PEMT pathway is insufficient to supply the body's need for
choline (Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, 1998). Low
serum phosphatidylcholine concentrations are potentially correctable
with increased intake of choline-rich foods. Children with stunting
may be at greater risk of choline deficiency due to a choline-poor diet.
The richest dietary sources of choline are mostly animal-based foods
(Zeisel and da Costa, 2009), which are not regularly consumed by
poor families in low-income countries. A recent study of urinary
metabolites suggests that biochemical pathways involving choline and
tryptophan metabolism are associated with catch-up growth in under-
nourished Brazilian children (Mayneris-Perxaches et al., 2016).
The findings from this study cannot necessarily be extrapolated to
other children at risk of stunting, since there may be dietary, cultural,
and environmental factors that differ from the setting in rural Malawi.
Serum metabolite concentrations may change over time. However,
studies in adults show that the intra-class correlation coefficients for re-
peated measurements of the metabolites involved in this study are
moderately high (Breier et al., 2014). Although the mTORC1 and GCN2
pathways provide a biological framework for interpreting the findings
of this study, the present study is limited in that it provides no direct ev-
idence of alterations in the mTORC1 or GCN2 pathways. Such studies
could be undertaken in the future and would likely require evidence
on the level of the transcriptome or proteome.
The strengths of this study are the community-based sample of chil-
dren in rural Africa in a setting where stunting is common, the use of
gold standard LC–MS/MS methodology, and a well-characterized and
validated platform for absolute quantification of serum metabolites
(Breier et al., 2014; Reinehr et al., 2015; Schmerler et al., 2012). There
is currently little reference data available on serum amino acid concen-
trations in healthy children where LC–MS/MS has been used for abso-
lute quantification of amino acids.
This study suggests that the dietary intake of essential amino acids
may be insufficient in children with stunting. An insufficiency in essen-
tial amino acids could potentially explain why micronutrient and lipid
supplements have had little to no effect on child growth (Ashorn
et al., 2015; Garza, 2015; Mayo-Wilson et al., 2014; Ramakrishnan
et al., 2009; Stammers et al., 2015; van der Merwe et al., 2013).
mTORC1 and GCN2 growth regulatory pathways will not allow growth
to proceed if amino acids are not sufficient to synthesize proteins
(Efeyan et al., 2015; Laplante and Sabatini, 2012). The findings of the
study also support the notion that stunted children do not receive suffi-
cient dietary choline, as reflected by low serum sphingomyelins and al-
terations in phosphatidylcholines. Future studies are needed to
characterize serum choline in children with stunting. The present
study is cross-sectional, thus, causality cannot be necessarily inferred
between essential amino acids and stunting. Longitudinal prospective
assessments of serum amino acids and other metabolites will be critical
in understanding the association with linear growth in children. Corrob-
oration from longitudinal studies would provide the needed rationale
for randomized clinical trials. Randomized controlled trials would ulti-
mately be required to determine whether essential amino acids and
choline play a causal role in the pathogenesis of child stunting.
