Neuronal networks provide rapid 
neuroprotection against spreading 
toxicity
Andrew J. Samson1, Graham Robertson2, Michele Zagnoni2 & Christopher N. Connolly1
Acute secondary neuronal cell death, as seen in neurodegenerative disease, cerebral ischemia (stroke) 
and traumatic brain injury (TBI), drives spreading neurotoxicity into surrounding, undamaged, brain 
areas. This spreading toxicity occurs via two mechanisms, synaptic toxicity through hyperactivity, and 
excitotoxicity following the accumulation of extracellular glutamate. To date, there are no fast-acting 
therapeutic tools capable of terminating secondary spreading toxicity within a time frame relevant 
to the emergency treatment of stroke or TBI patients. Here, using hippocampal neurons (DIV 15–20) 
cultured in microfluidic devices in order to deliver a localized excitotoxic insult, we replicate secondary 
spreading toxicity and demonstrate that this process is driven by GluN2B receptors. In addition to 
the modeling of spreading toxicity, this approach has uncovered a previously unknown, fast acting, 
GluN2A-dependent neuroprotective signaling mechanism. This mechanism utilizes the innate 
capacity of surrounding neuronal networks to provide protection against both forms of spreading 
neuronal toxicity, synaptic hyperactivity and direct glutamate excitotoxicity. Importantly, network 
neuroprotection against spreading toxicity can be effectively stimulated after an excitotoxic insult has 
been delivered, and may identify a new therapeutic window to limit brain damage.
During the development of the central nervous system, competition for synapse formation and early patterns of 
neuronal network activity are required for neurons to “fire together and wire together”
, driving the formation of 
functional neuronal networks1–3. Once established, neuronal survival is conditional upon continued participa-
tion in network activity. However, following cerebral ischemia (stroke) or traumatic brain injury (TBI), synapsed 
neurons in the surrounding penumbral region are at high risk from spreading depolarizations4 and elevated 
extracellular glutamate released by cell lysis and transporter reversal5, leading to NMDA receptor dependent 
synaptic toxicity5–7 and excitotoxicity5,7–10. Paradoxically, the use of NMDA receptor antagonists as neuroprotect-
ants actually exacerbates brain injury11,12 due to inhibition of essential pro-survival signaling that occurs through 
these receptors10,13,14. To date, successful protection of neurons against damage can be achieved by the use of 
preconditioning paradigms, where low-level stimulation13–17, or exercise18,19, can induce a neuroprotective state 
to subsequent larger insults. Unfortunately, the duration (days) of preconditioning required for neuroprotection 
to develop limits its clinical value.
Given that damage from a lesion does not spread uncontrollably to consume the entire brain, combined with 
our knowledge that synaptic neurotransmission can be protective10,13,14, it is reasonable to assume that neuronal 
networks may possess an innate capacity to restrict damage in vivo. However, a problem in studying spreading 
toxicity to naïve neurons in vivo is the difficulty in separating the initial lesion from its downstream consequences. 
We have achieved this separation using an in vitro model based on a microfluidic channel network, where mul-
tiple neuron populations, that are environmentally isolated but synaptically connected, are cultured and their 
microenvironment precisely manipulated20. Using this approach, we can isolate activity-dependent spreading 
toxicity from direct glutamate excitotoxicity and use this to model and investigate potential neuroprotective net-
work activity.

Results
Functional synaptic communication between environmentally-isolated neuronal networks. 
 
In order to isolate secondary spreading toxicity from the primary excitotoxic insult, we adopted the use of a 
microfluidic system having five cell culture chambers serially interconnected by 500 μ 
m long microchannels 
(Fig. 1a). Hippocampal neurons were cultured in each chamber and synaptically connected via axons traversing 
the microchannels (Fig. 1b). A protocol (detailed in Materials and Methods) was developed to ensure that, during 
exposure of an insult in the desired chamber, no cross-contamination occurred into surrounding chambers. To 
validate the protocol, a fluorescein suspension was added to the ‘direct’ insulted chamber (chamber ‘0’
, Fig. 1a) 
and its diffusion monitored via epifluorescence microscopy across a field of view spanning the ‘direct’ and ‘indi-
rect’ chambers at five different locations (Fig. 1c). The fluorescence signals show that an almost constant intensity 
is achieved at the site of delivery, with no fluorescence detected in the microchannels or surrounding chambers20.
Prior to microfluidic experimentation, we established the neuronal responses to excitotoxicity. Hippocampal 
neuron-seeded coverslips were exposed to various concentrations of glutamate (with glycine as a co-agonist) for 
1 hour, and stained with Hoeschst-33342 (4.5 μ 
M) and propidium iodide (20 μ 
M) 24 hours later to determine the 
percentage of live/dead cells, respectively. Excitotoxicity to glutamate occurred at 100 μ 
M (100 GG, 78.1 ± 
 17.83% 
cell death, P < 
 0.001), with 50 μ 
M being subtoxic (50 GG, 35.45 ± 
 11.19% cell death, P > 
 0.05). As reported pre-
viously15, following an excitotoxic challenge (100 GG) to a single neuronal chamber in the microfluidic device, 
a rapid influx of Ca2+ is observed, followed by a prolonged raised basal level (the latent period) and ultimately 
to delayed Ca2+ deregulation (Fig. 1d, upper panel, black trace). Confirming neuronal communication exists 
between chambers, a consequential Ca2+ response with rapid spiking activity occurs in downstream chambers 
(Fig. 1d, lower panel, red trace). These downstream signals are abolished in the absence of action potential firing 
(tetrodotoxin, TTX, 0.5 μ 
M) (Fig. 1d, lower panel, blue trace).

Glutamate-induced spreading neurotoxicity through neuronal networks. 
Mitochondrial depo-
larization, an early indicator of excitotoxicity15, occurs in the chamber directly exposed to 100 GG (Fig. 2a, 
direct), but despite the Ca2+ spikes present in the downstream neuronal chambers, mitochondrial depolarization 
does not spread (Fig. 2a, indirect). This suggests a localized excitotoxic insult evokes a spreading hyperactivity 
to a wider neuronal network4–7. To explore whether toxicity spreads in the absence of spreading extracellular 
glutamate, an excitotoxic insult (100 GG, 1 hour) was delivered to the central chamber only (Fig. 2b, chamber 
0) and morphological changes (MAP2 staining) and cell death (propidium iodide) determined in all 5 cham-
bers after 1 hour or 24 hours, respectively. As expected, extensive dendritic beading and neuronal cell death was 
observed in the directly exposed central chamber (62.84 ± 
 13.28% cell death, subsequently normalized to 100% 
for clarity). Dendrotoxicity and cell death spread from the central chamber to connected neurons in both adja-
cent (−

 19.78%/77.73 ± 
 25.1% respectively) and into both distal (−

(75.15 ± 
 22.84%/68.35 ± 
 17.28%, respectively) (Fig. 2b, white bars), as compared to control saline-treated devices 
(UT, 30.44 ± 3.0%). In the absence of synaptic neurotransmission (TTX, 0.5 μ 
M), spreading toxicity is abolished 
in all downstream chambers (−

respectively. Figure 2b, black bars). To examine the effect of a failure of glutamate transporter function, as occurs 
under ischemic conditions, we included a glutamate transporter blocker (TFB-TBOA) to chambers on one side of 
the excitotoxic insult. At a concentration that specifically blocks glial glutamate transporters (0.1 μ 
M), or when all 
glutamate transporters are blocked (1 μ 
M, not shown), cell death from spreading toxicity is exacerbated (Fig. 2c). 
Selective blockade of downstream NMDA receptors with MK 801 (10 μ

baseline in the indirect chambers (Fig. 2d), and abolishes spreading toxicity (47.32 ± 7.55%, Fig. 2e). More selec-
tively, spreading toxicity is abolished in the presence of the GluN2B antagonist, Ifenprodil (10 μ 
M, 56.51 ± 
 5.05%), 
but not the GluN2A antagonist, NVP-AAM077 (0.5 μ 
M, 72.09 ± 
 16.83%, Fig. 2f), indicating that spreading toxicity 
 
from a localized excitotoxic insult into downstream neuronal networks, occurs via GluN2B receptors.
Spatiotemporal spreading neuroprotection in connected networks. 
Subtoxic insults have been 
reported to exert a protective preconditioning effect that protects neurons against subsequent excitotoxic chal-
lenges13–17. In keeping with this, a 1 hour treatment of 50 GG is protective against a direct excitotoxic insult (100 
GG, 1 hour) delivered after 24 hours, but protection is not established immediately (Fig. 3a). This slow-onset pro-
tection requires ongoing neurotransmission, as it is blocked by TTX (Fig. 3a). Therefore, we questioned whether a 
preconditioning stimulus (50 GG) could also transmit protection along a neuronal network. In keeping with this, 
preconditioning transmits a downstream Ca2+ response (50 GG, Fig. 3b, black traces) in surrounding neuronal 
networks, although it does not reproduce the prolonged Ca2+ spiking activity generated by an excitotoxic insult 
(Fig. 1d), but does stimulate a raised Ca2+ level that slowly returns to baseline (Fig. 3b, red trace). Interestingly, 
despite preconditioning being ineffective when delivered just prior to an excitotoxic insult (Fig. 3a), it can transmit 
a fast acting protective signal to downstream chambers, where neurons are protected against spreading toxicity 
 
initiated from a subsequent upstream excitotoxic insult delivered immediately afterwards (Fig. 3c).
Spreading toxicity during stroke or a TBI in vivo is likely to be a consequence of both synaptic toxicity through 
hyperactivity and excitotoxicity from extracellular accumulation of glutamate5. To address the capacity of this fast 
acting network signal to also protect against a subsequent direct excitotoxic insult, a preconditioning stimulus 
 
(50 GG, 1 hour) was delivered to the central chamber, followed immediately by an excitotoxic insult (100 GG, 
1 hour) to all five chambers. As seen previously (Fig. 3a,c), no protection was afforded to the directly precon-
ditioned chamber (Fig. 3d, chamber 0). However, the spreading protective signal is capable of delivering a fast 
onset (< 
1 hour) protection against a direct excitotoxic insult (70.87 ± 
 16.47% and 58.29 ± 
 13.74% cell death 
in −

activity-dependent, as it is blocked by TTX (111.53 ±

 15.51% cell death in −

2, 
 
respectively) (Fig. 3d, white bars), and prevents excitotoxicity-induced delayed Ca2+ deregulation and mitochon-
drial depolarization (Fig. 3e,f). In contrast to the role of GluN2B NMDA receptors in spreading toxicity (Fig. 2f), 
GluN2A receptors are responsible for this spreading protection as it is blocked by NVP-AAM077 (0.5 μ 
M, 
 
98.74 ± 4.13% cell death), but not Ifenprodil (10 μ 
M, 65.79 ± 10.78% cell death) (Fig. 3g).
It has been reported that GABAA receptor activity can attenuate NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity, whilst 
GABAB receptor activity is ineffective21. In support of these findings, we observe that during an excitotoxic insult, 
muscimol (100 μ 
M) and diazepam (5 μ 
M), but not baclofen (100 μ 
M), is neuroprotective against excitotoxicity 
 
(Fig. 4a). Interestingly however, baclofen becomes neuroprotective against excitotoxicity if present prior to 
(1 hour) and during the insult (Fig. 4a). We therefore investigated whether GABAA and GABAB receptor 
inhibitory activity can counter spreading toxicity. An excitotoxic insult was delivered to the central chamber 
 
(100 GG, 1 hour), while GABAA or GABAB receptors were stimulated (100 μ 
M muscimol, 5 μ 
M diazepam or 100 μ 
M 
baclofen) in downstream chambers. In all cases, spreading toxicity was abolished (muscimol, 43.72 ± 0.3%, diaz-
epam 44.53 ± 3.8%, and baclofen, 48.04 ± 
 3.89%) (Fig. 4b), when compared to saline-treated cells (Fig. 4b, white 
bar). In support of a role for increased inhibitory tone in quenching excitatory signaling and spreading toxic-
ity, either GABAA or GABAB receptor activation (muscimol or baclofen, respectively) can terminate the rapid 
downstream Ca2+ spiking activity characteristic of a spreading excitotoxic challenge (Fig. 4c), further indicating 
that spreading hyperactivity is neurotoxic. However, protection against subsequent excitotoxicity is only blocked 
by GABAB receptor inhibition (1 μ 
M CGP-55845, 90.21 ± 
 2.24%) with little impact on protection by GABAA 
receptor inhibition (50 μ 
M bicuculline, 74.42 ± 
 12.25%) (Fig. 4d). These data suggest therefore, that a localized 
preconditioning stimulus initiates the recruitment of GABAB receptor inhibitory neuroprotection in surrounding 
neurons against subsequent direct excitotoxic challenges.
Recruiting network neuroprotection after an excitotoxic insult. 
To investigate the temporal effec-
tiveness of this rapid network protection, we explored whether neuroprotection could be achieved with shorter 
durations prior to an insult, or even post-insult. We find that an equal level of network protection is still possible 
when the protective stimulus (50 GG) is reduced to just 30 minutes (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, network protection 
is stable for at least 1 hour, as determined by delaying the excitotoxic insult (Fig. 5b). However, when the inter-
val between the protective stimulus and toxic insult was expanded to 4 hours, no network protection is evident

(Fig. 5c). This suggests that unlike preconditioning (a slow onset, persistent neuroprotection), the network pro-
tection discovered here is fast acting but transient, providing immediate protection against excitotoxic damage.
Of particular relevance to an emergency clinical situation of TBI, or following a stroke, would be the ability for 
a neuroprotective strategy to be effective after the onset of damage. Therefore, we investigated whether the pro-
tection could be achieved after a localised excitotoxic insult had been delivered (postconditioning). Interestingly, 
a protective stimulus, delivered an hour after a localized excitotoxic insult, can still afford full protection against 
spreading toxicity (36.44 ± 
 10.81% and 35.39 ± 
 9.67% cell death in − 
2/− 
1 and 1/2, respectively, Fig. 5d gray 
bars), suggesting that downstream neurons surrounding a lesion are not committed to die during this insult 
period. However, little protection against the direct excitotoxic challenge is evident (85.79 ± 
 11.48% cell death 
in chamber 0) in this time period. In contrast, when the protective stimulus was delivered sooner (after 30 min), 
significant neuroprotection is also observed (60.25 ± 
 15.32%) against the direct excitotoxic challenge (Fig. 5e). 
When the protection was delivered after just 10 minutes, full protection is observed (50.94 ± 
 9.17%) against the 
lesion in all chambers (Fig. 5f). This vanishing therapeutic window against direct ongoing excitotoxic damage 
most likely represents the time taken for cells to undergo terminal delayed Ca2+ deregulation (Fig. 1d).
Interestingly, although an excitotoxic insult clearly spreads neurotoxicity, this diminishes as it progresses 
(Fig. 2b, white bars), suggesting either an attenuation of the toxic signal over distance, or a recruitment of neu-
roprotective signaling (or both). We demonstrate the existence of a spreading neuroprotective signal, emanating 
from an excitotoxic insult, that confers network resistance to a subsequent direct excitotoxic challenge (Fig. 6), 
as would occur in vivo with elevated glutamate levels. Therefore, neuroprotective signaling may occur naturally 
within neuronal networks in vivo in response to an insult and will ultimately dominate over spreading toxicity. 
This mechanism may contribute to why an excitotoxic lesion in vivo does not spread uncontrollably to consume 
the entire brain, and our study reinforces how a blanket NMDA receptor blockade will exacerbate network dam-
age11 by preventing innate neuroprotective network signaling. Instead, therapeutic approaches to promote this 
innate spreading neuroprotective network activity may effectively terminate ongoing secondary neuronal toxicity.

Discussion
Using hippocampal neurons cultured in multi-chambered microfluidic devices it is possible to produce 
environmentally-isolated neuronal populations that are synaptically interconnected20. Using this model, an 
isolated excitotoxic insult may be delivered to a neuronal network and spreading toxicity monitored. We 
observe that downstream non-insulted neurons may succumb to secondary spreading neuronal toxicity 
through GluN2B-mediated hyperactivity. In addition to the modeling of spreading toxicity, akin to a neuronal 
network protection racket, we demonstrate that neuronal networks offer a previously unknown, fast acting 
GluN2A-dependent neuroprotective signaling mechanism. This mechanism utilizes the innate capacity of sur-
rounding neuronal networks to quench excitation, through the recruitment of GABAB receptors, to provide pro-
tection against excitotoxicity. Importantly, network neuroprotection against spreading toxicity can be effectively 
stimulated after an excitotoxic insult has been delivered, and may identify a new therapeutic window to limit 
on-going brain damage in conditions of chronic (neurodegenerative disease) or acute (stroke, TBI) neuronal 
injury.
Stroke and TBI are leading causes of death and long term disability in adults worldwide, with patients often 
unable to return to work, and requiring around the clock care. Rapid therapeutic intervention is key to reducing 
mortality and improving the prognosis by curtailing the extent of brain damage. Beyond the lesioned area of 
the brain lies an area of increased vulnerability, the penumbra. Within this penumbral region, neurons may be 
exposed to synaptic hyperactivity6,7, toxic spreading depolarization4,22,23 and high levels of extracellular gluta-
mate, leading to excitotoxicity4,8,9,15. Such a cascade of toxicity could consume entire networks, but is naturally 
restricted.
A number of forms of neuroprotection have been identified to date10,13,14,16–19 which may offer great promise in 
the treatment of chronic conditions, where disease progression is slow, however, protective mechanisms involving 
gene regulation require days to become effective (preconditioning) and so have limited therapeutic value in the 
emergency treatment of stroke and TBI patients. The direct approach of using NMDA receptor antagonists to 
block ongoing excitotoxicity has failed due to the paradoxical neuroprotective role of NMDA receptors. However, 
the uncoupling of NMDA receptors from cell death pathways hold great promise and may be selective against 
pathological NMDA receptor activity, leaving neuroprotective signalling intact24–26. To date, there are no effective 
strategies to prevent neurotoxicity spreading into surrounding neuronal networks. Therefore, current research 
has focused on promoting brain recovery27–29. Here we demonstrate a potential neuroprotective role for the use of 
benzodiazepines following a stroke. In contrast however, a recent meta-analysis has concluded that the potentia-
tion of GABAA receptor activity is not effective30. Indeed, the functional recovery of network activity is compro-
mised by increased extrasynaptic GABAA receptor activity for weeks31. However, inhibition of this extrasynaptic 
activity immediately after the onset of stroke increases the infarct size, suggesting a GABAergic neuroprotective 
role immediately after a stroke. This is further supported by the findings that clomethiazole is effective at reducing 
ischemic damage if applied rapidly32,33, but not if delayed34. Therefore, a strategic transient (hours) potentiation 
of GABAA receptors35, followed by a prolonged (weeks) inhibition of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors may be an 
optimal, untested, neuroprotective strategy.
This study has demonstrated that a therapeutic opportunity to curtail spreading toxicity may exist by harness-
ing the innate capacity of neuronal networks to block toxicity. The recruitment of this neuroprotection occurs in 
a timescale significantly faster (< 
hour) than classical preconditioning (days), where upregulation of pro-survival 
genes is required to boost antioxidant defence, suppress caspase activation and promote mitochondrial health10,14. 
Moreover, neuroprotection from preconditioning is persistent, lasting for several days36,37, while the fast-acting 
neuroprotection demonstrated in this study is transient, lasting for less than 4 hours. Together, this indicates that 
the network recruitment of neuroprotection discovered here is temporally distinct from the previously identi-
fied preconditioning pathways. However, it remains possible that normal preconditioning is tempered by the 
Figure 6. Spreading neuroprotection from an excitotoxic insult. Neuroprotection against a subsequent 
direct excitotoxic challenge is also spread by an excitotoxic insult (n = 3). Basal cell death is indicated by the 
dotted line (UT). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E.M (one way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s test. ‘ns’ denotes 
p > 0.05, **denotes p < 0.01, relative to control). Experiments were performed using independent neuronal

coexistence of the opposing actions of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors38, and a more rapid onset of precondition-
ing signalling may be possible.
The spreading network protection identified here, reduces deleterious Ca2+ influx into neurons, prevents 
subsequent mitochondrial depolarization and excitotoxicity-induced delayed Ca2+ deregulation, and is effec-
tive against both synaptic hyperactivity and extrasynaptic excitotoxicity. We demonstrate that in response to an 
excitotoxic lesion, both toxic and protective signals permeate through a network concomitantly, but as they pro-
gress, neuroprotection untimely dominates, and offers a mechanistic explanation of why a lesion does not spread 
uncontrollably to engulf the entire brain. The point at which the neuroprotective network signalling dominates 
may also contribute to defining the extent of the penumbral region that is susceptible to excitotoxic damage. 
These data are in keeping with previous studies which report a neuroprotective role for enhanced (synaptic) 
GluN2A and a neurotoxic role for (extrasynaptic) GluN2B receptors in mature neurons8,10,13,14.
A new potential pharmacological opportunity to limit neuronal damage is indicated by the requirement for 
GABAB receptor function in delivering protection against subsequent excitotoxicity. However, an alternative ther-
apeutic strategy to pharmacological manipulation may be to provide direct transcranial neuronal stimulation to 
connected brain regions. There is a therapeutic precedence for the use of brain stimulation in the treatment of the 
dysfunctional brain. A number of optical, electrical and magnetic approaches exist28,39,40, with electroconvulsive 
therapy being used for decades to treat depression and more recently proposed as a treatment for neurodegener-
ative disease patients41. Recent clinical trial evidence suggests that non-convulsive electrical stimulation may also 
be effective42, transcranial current stimulation post stroke may improve motor recovery43 and the extension of 
acupuncture to include the potential of electrostimulation (electroacupuncture) appears to have beneficial effects 
for acute ischemic stroke44.
Interestingly, in a model of Huntington disease, the synaptic: extrasynaptic NMDA receptor balance is criti-
cal in regulating mutant Huntingtin toxicity45 and dysregulation contributes to disease onset and progression46. 
Additionally, a recent report has identified a role for β 
-amyloid in increasing the expression of dendritic GluN2B, 
whilst decreasing the synaptic level of GluN2A in a model of Alzheimer’s disease47. Therefore, it may be possible 
that increased vulnerability to, or enhancement of, innate GluN2B-mediated spreading network toxicity and/or 
limitation of innate GluN2A-mediated spreading network neuroprotection, as revealed in this study, contributes 
to the progressive loss of neurons found in chronic neurodegenerative disease, and reflects a common mecha-
nism of dysfunction in the brain. This would be further enhanced by the loss of synaptic contacts reported in 
Alzheimer’s disease48. It may therefore be possible, through stimulating neuronal network protective signalling, 
to provide a common treatment for these conditions. Future study will be required to elucidate whether the pro-
tective mechanisms identified in this study are efficacious in these chronic disease states.
In summary, we demonstrate the value of microfluidics in the study of neuronal network communication that 
is relevant to pathological conditions of rapid neurotoxicity (stroke, TBI) as well as conditions of network dys-
function (epileptiform activity, spreading depolarizations, neurodegenerative disease). We reveal a novel form of 
rapid neuroprotective signalling within networks, relying on the innate capacity of neurons to quench excitation. 
In previous studies, such network activity may have been overwhelmed by the initiation of global excitotoxic 
mechanisms. Harnessing the full potential of this innate network neuroprotective capacity may open the doors 
to many therapeutic opportunities.
Materials and Methods
Device preparation. 
Microfluidic devices were fabricated in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using standard 
soft lithography techniques. Silicon masters were produced using a double layer of SU8 photoresist (3000 series, 
MicroChem, US) on a silicon wafer. The first layer (5 μ 
m thick - SU8 3010) formed the microchannels (500 μ 
m 
long, 10 μ 
m wide, 40 μ 
m pitch) connecting the five chambers (1 mm wide, 11–17 mm long), which were obtained 
through a second layer of resist (100 μ 
m thick - SU8 3035). The resist was exposed through a chrome photo-
mask (JD Photo- Tools, UK) to UV light and was developed in MicroPosit EC solvent (Rohm and Haas, US). 
To prevent PDMS adhesion to the resulting silicon master, the silicon surface was silanized by vapor deposition 
of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl-trichlorosilane (Sigma Aldrich, UK) for 1 hour. PDMS was then poured onto 
the silicon master at a 10:1 ratio of polymer to curing agent, degassed and cured at 80 °C for at least 3 hours. The 
PDMS devices were then peeled from the mould, cut to the desired size, and holes were punched (4 mm diameter) 
to obtain the inlet and outlet wells for each chamber. PDMS devices were cleaned and irreversibly bonded to glass 
coverslips using oxygen plasma. Bonded devices were then washed with DI water, UV sterilized and flooded with 
a solution of poly-D-lysine (PDL, 15 μ 
g/ml) for 2 hours to create a suitable adhesion layer within the chambers 
and microchannels. Finally, devices were washed with Neurobasal-A medium (Life Technologies) prior to cell 
injection.
Neuronal cell culture. 
Hippocampi from 1–3 day old Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes were dissected and 
minced. Tissue was suspended in filter-sterilized 1.5 mg/ml papain (Sigma Aldrich, UK) in buffer comprised of: 
(mM) 116 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 26 NaHCO3, 1.3 NaH2PO4, 2 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 0.5 EDTA, and 25 D(+ 
)-glucose, pH 7.4, and 
incubated at 37 °C for 20 minutes. Tissue was then triturated with a series of 3 flame- polished glass Pasteur pipettes 
of decreasing tip diameter in 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma Aldrich, UK) solution (in buffer as above). 
 
The resultant cell suspension was spun down and the pellet resuspended in culture medium consisting of 
Neurobasal-A Medium supplemented with 2% (v/v) B-27 and 2 mM L-glutamine, at a density of 3.5 × 
 106 cells/ml. 
 
Cells were loaded into multi-chamber microfluidic devices and incubated in culture medium and maintained 
in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 15 μ 
l of medium was replaced in each well every 2–3 days and 
experiments were performed between 15 and 20 days in vitro (DIV 15–20). By DIV 15, hippocampal neurons 
had developed a rich network of processes, expressed functional (Fura-2, AM responses) AMPA/kainate and

GluN2A and GluN2B NMDA receptors, as determined by the use of AMPA/NMDA and selective antagonists 
(NVP-AAM077 and ifenprodil, respectively).
Immunocytochemistry. 
Neuron-seeded devices were stained after DIV 15 to assess the connections 
between neuronal chambers, as previously described20. Briefly, cultures within devices were washed with phos-
phate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in paraformaldehyde (4%, 10 mins). Cells were then washed in PBS and 
nonspecific binding prevented by incubation in a blocking solution containing fetal calf serum (5% v/v) and BSA 
(1% w/v) and 0.01% Triton-X100 for 30 mins. Cells were washed with PBS and primary antibodies for MAP2 
(1:250 dilution) and β 
-III-Tubulin (neuron-specific cytoskeletal marker, 1:500 dilution) were diluted into block-
ing solution and incubated with cultures (1 hour). Cells were then washed with PBS, incubated with fluores-
cently labelled secondary antibodies, and imaged using a cooled CCD digital camera (ORCA-ER, Hamamatsu, 
Japan) and a 40x PL Fluotar oil-immersion objective lens on a Leica DM-IRB inverted microscope (both Leica, 
Germany) using Volocity Acquisition software (Improvision, UK).
Fluorescence microscopy. 
Calcium imaging with Fura-2, AM (Invitrogen) was done as previously 
described15. Briefly, hippocampal neuron-seeded microfluidic devices were loaded with Fura-2, AM (3 μ 
M) for 
45 minutes at 37 °C (in the dark) in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) comprising (mM) 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 
1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 D(+ 
)-glucose (pH 7.4). Devices were washed extensively prior to experimentation, 
and fluorescence monitored using 340 and 380 nm excitation filters and a 535 nm emission filter. Capture rate was 
set at 5 seconds per time point to ensure fast changes in calcium could be detected, and data were analyzed by 
expressing the emission at 535 from excitation at 340 and 380 nm as a ratio, with background subtraction for each 
channel at each time point. Mitochondrial membrane potential was recorded using rhodamine 123 (Invitrogen). 
Briefly, hippocampal neuron seeded microfluidic devices were incubated with rhodamine 123 (10 μ 
g/ml) in HBS 
in the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes. Devices were washed and fluorescence monitored using a 492 nm 
excitation filter and a 535 nm emission filter. Regions of interest containing mitochondria were selected posthoc 
and fluorescence intensities measured for each time point.
Neuronal cell death. 
Neuron-seeded devices were treated with various pharmacological agents in HBS, 
as indicated. Following treatment, neurons were returned to culture media for 24 hours prior to staining with 
propidium iodide (PI, 20 μ 
M) and Hoechst 33342 (Hoe, 4.5 μ 
M) for 30 minutes. Cell death was assessed by count-
ing both dead and live neurons in 6–8 fields of view. Cell death was expressed as a percentage of dead cells to total 
cell number (live + dead) and analyzed.
Microfluidic protocol for insult delivery. 
To avoid cross-contamination of substances between 
the chambers and ensure that any toxicity spread was solely induced via neuronal network communication 
across the microchannels, both numerical simulations (COMSOL 3.5 – superimposing the laminar flow and 
 
diffusion equations) and experimental validation were performed to estimate the optimum condition of fluids 
to be injected in each well of the device. Briefly, prior to insult delivery, 40 μ 
l of HBS was injected in every well 
(maximum volume). Subsequently, the wells of the addressed chamber were emptied and 35 μ 
l of experimental 
solution (HBS + 
 drug) was injected in the inlet well and 30 μ 
l in the outlet well. Volumes were dispensed in 10 μ 
l 
steps to minimize shear stress on the cells within the culture chambers. Every four minutes, 10 μ 
l was withdrawn 
from the outlet well and 10 μ 
l of fresh experimental solution was replaced in the inlet well. This procedure 
was carried out continuously for the duration of the experiment, guaranteeing no cross contamination to the 
 
adjacent chambers.
