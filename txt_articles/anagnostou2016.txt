IMPORTANCE Atypical antipsychotic medications are indicated for the treatment of irritability
and agitation symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Unfortunately,
these medications are associated with weight gain and metabolic complications that are
especially troubling in children and with long-term use.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of metformin for weight gain associated with atypical
antipsychotic medications in children and adolescents with ASD (defined in the protocol as
DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder
not otherwise specified), aged 6 to 17 years.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
randomized clinical trial was conducted at 4 centers in Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Columbus,
Ohio; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Nashville, Tennessee. In all, 209 potential participants
were screened by telephone, 69 individuals provided consent, and 61 participants were
randomized to receive metformin or placebo between April 26, 2013, and June 24, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS Metformin or matching placebo titrated up to 500 mg twice daily for
children aged 6 to 9 years and 850 mg twice daily for those 10 to 17 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome measure was change in body mass
index (BMI) z score during 16 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes included changes in
additional body composition and metabolic variables. Safety, tolerability, and efficacy
analyses all used a modified intent-to-treat sample comprising all participants who received
at least 1 dose of medication.
RESULTS Of the 61 randomized participants, 60 participants initiated treatment (45 [75%]
male; mean [SD] age, 12.8 [2.7] years). Metformin reduced BMI z scores from baseline to
week 16 significantly more than placebo (difference in 16-week change scores vs placebo,
−0.10 [95% CI, −0.16 to −0.04]; P = .003). Statistically significant improvements were also
noted in secondary body composition measures (raw BMI, −0.95 [95% CI, −1.46 to −0.45]
and raw weight, −2.73 [95% CI, −4.04 to −1.43]) but not in metabolic variables. Overall,
metformin was well tolerated. Five participants in the metformin group discontinued
treatment owing to adverse events (agitation, 4; sedation, 1). Participants receiving
metformin vs placebo experienced gastrointestinal adverse events during a significantly
higher percentage of treatment days (25.1% vs 6.8%; P = .005).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Metformin may be effective in decreasing weight gain
associated with atypical antipsychotic use and is well tolerated by children and adolescents
with ASD.

T
he atypical antipsychotic medications risperidone and
aripiprazole are the only treatments approved by the US
FoodandDrugAdministrationforuseinautismspectrum
disorder (ASD). Both medications improve irritability and agi-
tation symptoms in children with ASD as young as 5 (risperi-
done) or 6 (aripiprazole) years.1-6 Unfortunately, these medi-
cations also cause weight gain,7,8 and greater cumulative
exposure is also associated with increased diabetes risk.9,10
Although weight gain may be reversible,11,12 stopping these
medicines often leads to relapse of irritability and agitation.13
To our knowledge, no controlled studies have tested options
for combating this weight gain in children with ASD.
Metformin hydrochloride, a biguanide drug approved for
treatment of type 2 diabetes, increases insulin sensitivity and
decreasesintestinalglucoseabsorptionandhepaticglucosepro-
duction. Metformin has been studied for treatment of weight
gain in the absence of diabetes in typically developing
children.14,15 In adults, metformin can stop or reverse weight
gainassociatedwithatypicalantipsychotics.16-18Metforminsig-
nificantlyreducedbodymassindex(BMI)(calculatedasweight

ized clinical trial of 39 children aged 10 to 17 years who were re-
ceivingatypicalantipsychoticmedications,19 similarto2open-
label trials.20,21 Results of a smaller randomized clinical trial
failed to reach statistical significance.22 Adverse events (AEs)
inthesestudiesweretypicallymildandlargelyconfinedtogas-
trointestinal(GI)symptoms,includingdiarrheaandnausea.14-21
Because atypical antipsychotic medications are often
used in children with ASD and the mechanisms of weight
gain are thought to include insulin resistance,23 we sought
to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of metformin
to decrease weight gain associated with the use of atypical
antipsychotic medication in children with ASD. Unlike pre-
vious trials, we studied a younger age group that is at
greater cumulative risk due to extended antipsychotic expo-
sure. In addition, we focused exclusively on children with
ASD who are less able to communicate potential AEs, thus
meriting a separate assessment of safety and tolerability. We
were concerned that GI AEs due to metformin15 could over-
lap with GI symptoms that are already common in ASD,24
potentially increasing irritability in children who cannot
readily communicate discomfort.
Our specific hypotheses were that, at the end of 16 weeks,
(1) metformin would ameliorate weight gain compared with
placebo (primary outcome measure, BMI z score; secondary
outcome measures, BMI, weight z score, and weight) and
(2) metformin would be well tolerated based on AE rates and
lack of worsening of the irritability/agitation targeted by atypi-
cal antipsychotic treatment.

Key Points
Question What is the effect of metformin hydrochloride on
weight gain associated with the use of atypical antipsychotics in
children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 60 participants,
metformin significantly reduced weight gain compared with
placebo. Overall, metformin was well tolerated during 16 weeks of
treatment.
Meaning In children and youth with autism spectrum disorder
who are receiving atypical antipsychotics, metformin may be
effective in decreasing weight gain.

Methods
Study Design and Participants
This was a 16-week, randomized clinical trial testing the safety,
tolerability, and efficacy of a liquid formulation of metformin
hydrochloride (Riomet) in children and adolescents with ASD
(Figure 1). The trial was conducted from April 26, 2013, to June
24, 2015. Participants were recruited through 4 academic sites
participatingintheAutismSpeaksAutismTreatmentNetwork.
Thistrialwasapprovedbytheinstitutionalreviewboardsateach

Inclusion criteria were age 6 to 17 years, 4 months; diag-
nosis of ASD (defined in the protocol as DSM-IV diagnosis of
autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, or pervasive developmen-
tal disorder not otherwise specified) based on the Autism
Diagnostic Observation Schedule26 and DSM-IV clinical
interview27; minimum of 1 month of therapy with a stable dose
of an atypical antipsychotic with no plans to change; and a
documented7%ormoreincreaseinBMIsincestartinganatypi-
cal antipsychotic (within the past 12 months), or, if the BMI was
in the 85th percentile or higher, a greater than 5% body weight
increase per year since starting the medication, as docu-
mented by previous weight records.
Exclusion criteria were a history of intolerable AEs with
metformin, previous use of metformin of sufficient dose and
duration to determine response status, any serious medical
illness requiring treatment or increasing the risk of lactic aci-
dosis, use of medication with unacceptable interactions with
metformin, planned procedure requiring contrast medium,
pregnancy at screening, current use of medication for target
symptomsofappetiteorweightloss,orinabilitytotolerateblood
work.
Screening Assessments
Diagnostic assessment included the Autism Diagnostic Obser-
vation Schedule26 and DSM-IV interview27; cognitive assess-
mentwasperformedusingtheStanford-Binet,5thEdition,Ab-
breviated Battery28 or Mullen Scales of Early Learning29; and
behavior was evaluated by the caregiver-completed Aberrant
Behavior Checklist.30 A comprehensive medical and develop-
mental assessment included vital signs, height, weight, physi-
cal examination, review of medical and psychiatric history in-
cluding Safety Monitoring Uniform Report Form,31,32 review
of concomitant therapies, and clinical laboratory tests (liver
function, metabolic panel, serum lactate, fasting glucose, he-
moglobin A1c, insulin, vitamin B12, lipid panel, and complete
blood cell count). Urine or blood pregnancy testing was con-
ducted for girls of child-bearing potential.
Study Intervention
All participants and caregivers received brief counseling and
informationalhandoutsregardingdietandexercisebeforethey
beganthetrial.Metforminhydrochloride(Riomet)andmatching
placebo were donated by Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Ltd.
Metformin was dispensed as a liquid suspension of 100 mg/
mL, with placebo matching the appearance, smell, and taste of
metformin.For6-to9-year-oldchildren,thedosagewasstarted
at 250 mg with their evening meal for 1 week, followed by the
addition of 250 mg at breakfast for 1 week. At the week 2 visit,
if the previous dose had been well tolerated, it was increased
to 500 mg twice daily. For 10- to 17-year-old participants,
treatmentwasstartedfollowingthesamescheduleasusedwith
the children, but at the week 4 visit, if the drug had been well
tolerated, the dose was increased to 850 mg twice daily. The
dosing strategy was based on previous pediatric trials of
metformin.15,19 If AEs occurred, the study physician (including
E.A., K.B.S., J.A.H., L.E.A., L.C., D.M., R.T., J.K., and J.V.-V.) had
the option to decrease the dose in multiples of 50 mg and
rechallenge once the AE was resolved, with higher doses
administered in multiples of 50-mg units.
All treatment was double-blinded. Randomization was
conductedbythedatacoordinatingcenterviapermutedblocks
stratified by age group (6-9 vs 10-17 years) and site using ran-
dom block sizes of 2 and 4. An autogenerated email with ran-
domization identification was sent to the site once a partici-
pant successfully enrolled. Only the investigational pharmacy
at each site and unblinded staff at the data coordinating cen-
ter had access to the treatment assignment.
Primary Outcome
Theprimaryefficacymeasurewaschangefrombaselinetoweek
16 in body mass index (BMI) z score calculated from the 2000
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (http://www.cdc
.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/growthcharts/resources/sas.htm) age-
and sex-normed growth charts at week 16. Height and weight
were measured at baseline and 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after
treatment initiation.
Secondary Outcomes
Secondary outcomes included (1) changes in other body
variables (absolute and relative change in weight, absolute
BMI, and abdominal and hip circumference) and (2) changes
in fasting metabolic variables (eTable 1 and eTable 2 in
Supplement 2). The Homeostasis Model Assessment of
Insulin Resistance33 was used to integrate fasting glucose
and insulin values in a composite measure of metabolic risk.
Safety Assessments
SafetywasassessedwiththeSafetyMonitoringUniformReport
Form,31,32 which was slightly modified to assess rare AEs previ-
ouslyreportedwithmetformin,14-22whichwasadministeredby
a clinician at every visit. Clinical laboratory tests were repeated
at week 16.
Given concern that children with ASD may be unable to re-
port AEs verbally and could manifest physical discomfort with
increased irritability/agitation,34-36 we examined the effect of
metformin vs placebo on irritability/agitation by caregiver rat-
ingsontheAberrantBehaviorChecklistIrritabilitysubscale.29,37
The Clinical Global Impression Scale–Improvement,38 based

Statistical Analysis
A sample size of 90 participants was originally planned, as-
sumingapooled,among-personSDof0.6fora16-weekchange
in BMI z score. Interim blinded analysis of change in BMI z
scores indicated an effective SD of only 0.16, and the sample
size was reduced to 60 for 80% power to detect a difference
of 0.12, which would be a difference in weight change of ap-
proximately 3.0 kg in our sample. The interim analysis was of
blinded data analyzed as a single sample only and thus did not
affect our type I error rate.39
Safety, tolerability, and efficacy analyses used a modified
intent-to-treat sample comprising all participants who re-
ceived at least 1 dose of medication. The primary efficacy end
point was 16-week change from baseline in BMI z scores. All
participants in the modified intent-to-treat sample were in-
cluded in the analysis. Secondary analysis included all par-
ticipant randomized, including 1 individual who did not re-
ceive medication (intent to treat).
The proportion of participants experiencing AEs classified
by the MedDRA (http://www.meddra.org/) system organ class
andpreferredtermwascomparedbetweentreatmentsbyusing
the Fisher exact test with estimated odds ratios and exact
95% confidence intervals. Effects of metformin on primary
and secondary efficacy outcomes were estimated
from shared-baseline, random-slope, linear mixed models
with fixed effects of stratum × visit (categorical) and
stratum × treatment × postbaseline visit interaction, and
random participant-specific intercepts and slopes with
unstructured covariance. The mean model was unstructured
in time, whereas the covariance model assumed participant-
specific linear deviations from the means. The shared-
baseline assumption, enforced by omitting a treatment main-
effect term, reflected the true state of the population before
randomizationandadjustsforchancedifferencesatbaseline.40
Effects of treatment assignment on 16-week change were
estimated by linear contrasts of the baseline and week 16 least-
square means using the observe stratum frequencies. Effect
sizes (ESs) for treatment differences were calculated relative
to the pooled SD for 16-week change among participants who

Results
Participants
Sixty-one participants were randomized and 60 initiated treat-
ment, 28 (7 [25%] female) received metformin and 32 (8 [25%]
female) received placebo, and the mean (SD) age was 12.8 (2.7)
years (Figure 1, Table 1, and eTable 3 in Supplement 2). One
participant randomized to receive metformin refused liquid
medication and therefore withdrew without ever taking treat-
ment. This participant was included only in the secondary ITT
analysis.
Atbaseline,theplacebogrouphadahigherIQthanthemet-
formin group (mean [SD], 84 [20] vs 69 [25]) and was receiv-
ing more psychotropic medications (53% vs 36% were taking
≥3 medications) (Table 1 and eTable 4 in Supplement 2).
In children aged 6 to 9 years, the mean final dose in both
the metformin and placebo groups was 1000 mg/d. In those
aged 10 to 17 years, the mean final dose in the metformin group
was 1587 mg/d and in the placebo group, 1674 mg/d (P = .24).
Adherence was excellent in both groups (96% of doses taken
in both groups, with ranges of 75%-100% in the metformin
group and 85%-100% in the placebo group).
Primary Outcome
To account for anticipated growth and differences in typical
BMI across childhood, we used changes in BMI standardized
to age- and sex-based norms (z scores). Metformin was supe-
rior to placebo in reducing weight gain associated with atypi-
calantipsychotics,asassessedbychangefrombaselinetoweek
16 BMI z scores (metformin vs placebo difference, −0.010 [95%
CI, −0.16 to −0.04]; ES, 0.82; P = .003) (Table 2, Figure 2, and
pretreatment and posttreatment values in eTable 5 in
Supplement 2). Participants receiving placebo experienced no
change over 16 weeks in BMI z scores (0.02 [95% CI, −0.03 to
0.06]);however,thosereceivingmetforminexperiencedasub-
stantial reduction compared with baseline (−0.08 [95% CI,
−0.13 to −0.04]). Three of 28 participants (11%) in the metfor-
min group experienced 8% to 9% declines in BMI. No other
participants experienced more than a 5% decline in BMI dur-
ing the 16-week treatment period. Benefit from metformin did
not differ significantly by study site (P = .91) (eTable 6 in
Supplement 2).
Secondary Outcomes
A similar pattern of differences between the treatment and pla-
cebo group was observed when examining weight z scores (ES,
1.04), BMI (ES, 1.01), weight (difference, 2.7 kg; ES, 1.13), BMI
percentiles(ES,0.47),andweightpercentiles(ES,0.65)(Table2
and Figure 2). Baseline BMI was positively but weakly associ-
ated with percentage change in BMI (r = 0.11; P = .39) (eFigure
in Supplement 2). No significant differences were noted in
changes of any of the metabolic variables studied (eTable 5 in
Supplement 2). Intent-to-treat analysis, including 1 partici-
pant who never received the study medication, did not lead to
meaningful changes in the results (eTable 7 in Supplement 2).
Safety
There was no significant difference between the groups in
change from baseline to week 16 on the Aberrant Behavior
Checklist Irritability subscale (ES, 0.01; P = .94) or the Clini-
cal Global Impression Scale Improvement Scale (ES, 0.11;
P = .91). There was 1 serious AE. A participant with a history
of hospital admissions for aggression who was randomized to
receive placebo was admitted for aggression. The serious AE

participant receiving placebo was lost to follow-up when the
participant withdrew consent after the dose of the atypical an-

ence in AEs between the groups (4 of 28 [14%] receiving met-
formin vs 0 of 32 receiving placebo; P = .04). There was a non-
significantincreaseinGIAEsinthemetformingroupcompared
with the placebo group (23 [82%] receiving metformin vs 19
[59%] receiving placebo; P = .09) (Table 3). Participants re-
ceiving metformin experienced GI AEs during a significantly
higher percentage of treatment days (25.1% vs 6.8%; P = .005).
Blinding Assessment
Both clinicians and participants were asked to guess whether
the participant was taking metformin or placebo at the end of
16 weeks. The rate of guessing participant assignment cor-
rectly did not differ significantly between the metformin and
placebo groups for either clinician (metformin: guessed met-
formin, 8%; placebo, 15%; uncertain, 77%; placebo: guessed
metformin, 10%; placebo, 24%; uncertain, 66%) or partici-
pant (metformin: guessed metformin, 32%, placebo, 36%, un-
certain, 32%; placebo: guessed metformin, 14%, placebo, 61%,
uncertain, 25%) guesses. Among caregivers who guessed
(excluding those who were uncertain), caregivers of placebo
participants more often guessed correctly (17 of 21 [81%]; odds
ratio,3.8[95%CI,0.7to2.15];P = .09).Correctguessingbycare-
givers did not predict change in the primary outcome mea-
sure (16-week change in BMI z score among placebo correct
guessers, −0.001; among placebo incorrect guessers, −0.025;
difference, 0.023 [95% CI, −0.08 to 0.12]; P = .65).
Post Hoc Analysis
Baseline variables differing substantially between groups in-
cluded aripiprazole use (metformin, 7 [25%]; placebo, 16
[50%]), risperidone use (metformin, 19 [68%]; placebo, 12
[38%]), and mean [SD] full-scale IQ (metformin, 69 [25];
placebo, 84 [20]). There was no evidence that any of these
findings confounded the association between randomized
treatment assignment and changes in BMI z scores: use of arip-
iprazole (interaction ES, 0.3; P = .61), use of risperidone (in-
teraction ES, 0.26; P = .64), age (interaction ES, 0.001 per
year; P = .91), full-scale IQ (interaction ES, 0.005 per unit;
P = .71), and number of psychotropic medications (interac-

indirect effect mediated by GI AEs were gains of 0.007 for BMI
zscores(95%CI,−0.027to0.042;P = .68)and0.11kgforweight
(95% CI, −0.57 to 0.80; P = .75).
Discussion
Atypical antipsychotic medications are US Food and Drug Ad-
ministration–approved for use in children at a younger age in
ASD than in any other condition; however, to our knowledge,
no previous studies have examined treatment or prevention
of weight gain in children with ASD who receive these medi-
cations. Metformin was superior to placebo in managing es-
tablished weight gain associated with atypical antipsychotics
inthispopulation.Childrenreceivingplacebocontinuedtogain
weight during the study, as expected for age (BMI z score in-
crease negligible), whereas BMI z scores decreased in the met-
formin group (Figure 2). The large effect size of BMI z score
changes in this study is comparable to that observed in the
Klein et al19 pediatric pilot trial of metformin in children re-
ceiving atypical antipsychotics. The benefits from treatment
in our sample were not clear until after 8 weeks of treatment
(Figure 2), which was also consistent with previous pediatric
RCTs15,19 of metformin targeting weight gain in children and
youth. Other strategies to reduce weight gain associated with
atypical antipsychotic use in adults include sibutramine hy-
drochloride and topiramate, but the AE profiles of these drugs
are not trivial.42 In children, stimulants failed to reduce weight
gain associated with atypical antipsychotics.43 In addition, nu-
tritional counseling has previously shown little benefit for chil-
dren and adolescents receiving atypical antipsychotic
medications,19 and food selectivity may make this particu-
larly challenging in the ASD population.26 However, metfor-
min was not only effective, it was well tolerated in our par-
ticipants. Although there was nonsignificant increase in GI
distress in the metformin group, GI AEs were not responsible
for any treatment discontinuation, and we found no evi-
dence that the benefit on BMI was due to GI AEs.
There are some important limitations to this study. First,
the length of metformin treatment may have been inad-
equate to capture metabolic benefits. Furthermore, the length
of the study was too short to evaluate whether initial improve-
ments will be maintained. The small sample size yielded too
little precision in our estimates to discount possible effects for
metabolic and behavioral outcomes. In addition, although we
had reliable information on the length of time that partici-
pants were stable on their current dose, we did not have reli-
able information on the length of overall exposure to antipsy-
chotic medications. We also did not evaluate the benefit of
lifestylemodifications,althoughbriefcounselingregardingdiet
and exercise was provided to all participants. Behavioral in-
terventions targeting weight in youth with ASD have not been
tested.Combinedprogramsthatcomparedmetforminwithpla-
cebo with all participants receiving vigorous and continuous
lifestyle supports might produce different results. Finally, this
study addressed only the benefit of metformin added to an
atypical antipsychotic after children had already gained sig-
nificant weight. The trial did not address the question of
whether coadministration of metformin at the onset of atypi-
cal antipsychotic use prevents initial weight gain, which is a
question for future research.
Conclusions
InthisRCT,metforminwaswelltoleratedandeffectiveatman-
aging weight gain associated with atypical antipsychotic use
in children and adolescents with ASD. These findings have im-
portantimplicationsforchildreninwhomthebenefitsofatypi-
cal antipsychotics for treating irritability and agitation symp-
toms are difficult to balance with the substantial weight gain
that often accompanies their use.
