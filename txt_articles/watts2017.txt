ABSTRACT 
Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANKL that decreases 
osteoclast formation, function and survival, and is approved for the treatment of postmenopausal 
women with osteoporosis at increased or high risk for fracture, among other indications.  During 
the pivotal 3-year fracture trial FREEDOM, denosumab 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 months 
significantly reduced new vertebral (68%), hip (40%), and nonvertebral (20%) fractures; 
increased bone mineral density (BMD); and reduced bone turnover markers compared with 
placebo in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.  Questions have arisen regarding 
imbalances of certain low-frequency adverse events (AEs) observed in FREEDOM, as well as 
the top 5 most frequent adverse reactions listed in the United States prescribing information 
(USPI; back pain, pain in extremity, musculoskeletal pain, hypercholesterolemia, and cystitis).  
We examined the incidences of these AEs in women who originally received placebo during 
FREEDOM and then received denosumab for up to 3 years during the FREEDOM Extension 
(Crossover Group).  This provided a unique opportunity for comparison with the original 3-year 
denosumab FREEDOM observations.  We also examined the incidences of these AEs over 6 
years of denosumab treatment (Long-term Group; i.e., comparing a second three years of 
treatment with findings in the first 3 years).  There was no indication of increasing trends 
regarding the imbalances of either low-frequency AEs or common AEs observed in FREEDOM.

INTRODUCTION 
Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANKL approved for the 
treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at increased (US) or high risk (EU) of 
fracture. During the pivotal 3-year fracture trial (FREEDOM), denosumab 60 mg (Prolia®, 
Amgen Inc.) subcutaneously every 6 months significantly reduced bone turnover markers 
(BTMs), increased bone mineral density (BMD), and reduced new vertebral (68%), hip (40%), 
and nonvertebral (20%) fractures compared with placebo in postmenopausal women with 
osteoporosis.(1) 
Osteoporosis is a chronic condition typically requiring long-term treatment.  Recent data 
indicate relatively long life expectancies at the time patients initiate osteoporosis therapy, 
including more than 13 years on average for a 75-year-old woman.(2)  The 7-year FREEDOM 
Extension trial (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00523341) was conducted to understand the effects of up 
to 10 total years of denosumab on safety and efficacy.  In the FREEDOM Extension, all 
participants received open-label denosumab every 6 months.  Extension participants who were 
originally randomized to denosumab in FREEDOM are referred to as the Long-term Denosumab 
Group, while those originally randomized to placebo in FREEDOM and then initiated 
denosumab in the Extension constitute the Crossover Group.  Efficacy data from year 2, year 3, 
and year 5 of the FREEDOM Extension indicate sustained reduction of BTMs and further, 
progressive increases in BMD in the Long-term Denosumab Group, along with maintenance of 
low fracture rates.(3-5)  In these studies, the Extension Crossover Group exhibited reductions in 
bone turnover markers and gains in BMD in response to denosumab that were generally similar 
to changes observed with the original denosumab group in FREEDOM.

The primary objective of the Extension is to describe the long-term safety and tolerability 
of denosumab.  Though lacking a placebo control, the Extension may provide safety information 
by comparing absolute adverse event (AE) incidence rates for the Long-term and Crossover 
Groups to that of the original denosumab and placebo groups from FREEDOM.  Such 
comparisons can indicate whether specific AEs that were imbalanced during FREEDOM 
persisted or increased in absolute terms during the Extension. 
Safety data for FREEDOM indicated imbalances in some low-frequency AEs favoring 
placebo (i.e., numerically more common in subjects receiving denosumab than in patients 
receiving placebo).(1)  For some of these AEs, including malignancy and infection, follow-up 
data were reported after 2, 3 and 5 years of the Extension.(3-5)  The current report provides 
Extension study data on an additional set of low-frequency AEs that showed imbalances in the 
original FREEDOM study.(1)  The five most frequent AEs from FREEDOM that exhibited 
imbalances favoring placebo were back pain, pain in extremity, musculoskeletal pain, 
hypercholesterolemia, and cystitis.  The incidences of these AEs are listed in the Prolia 
Highlights of Prescribing Information for the United States (USPI) as adverse reactions.  Here, 
we examined the incidences of these events in women who originally received placebo during 
FREEDOM and then received denosumab for up to 3 years during the FREEDOM Extension 
(Crossover Group).  This provided a unique opportunity for comparison with the original 3-year 
denosumab FREEDOM observations.  We also examined the incidences of these events over 6 
years of denosumab treatment (Long-term Group).

METHODS 
Study Design 
Study design details for the FREEDOM pivotal trial and the FREEDOM Extension have 
been described previously.(1,4)  FREEDOM was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, 3-year study conducted at 214 centers globally.  Study entry 
requirements specified women who were 60 to 90 years old and had a lumbar spine or total hip 
BMD T-score < –2.5 but not < –4.0 at either location.  Participants were randomized 1:1 to 
placebo or denosumab by an interactive voice-response system according to a schedule prepared 
by the sponsor before initiation of the study.  Participants received placebo or 60 mg denosumab 
(Prolia®; Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA) subcutaneously every 6 months for 3 years.  
Participants, investigators, and those evaluating study assessments were masked to group 
assignment.  All women who completed the FREEDOM pivotal trial (i.e., completed their 3-year 
visit, did not discontinue investigational product, and did not miss more than 1 dose) were 
eligible to enter the 7-year Extension.  The primary objective of the extension is to describe the 
safety and tolerability of denosumab.  During the Extension, all participants were scheduled to 
receive open-label denosumab 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 months.  Participants in 
FREEDOM and the FREEDOM Extension were instructed to take calcium (≥ 1 g) and vitamin D 
(≥ 400 IU) daily.  Participants were queried about AEs by study site staff every 3 months.  The 
analyses reported here include 3 years of FREEDOM and the first 3 years of the Extension. 
Representatives of the sponsor designed the study in collaboration with investigators, and 
conducted statistical analyses according to a prespecified plan.  The study protocol was approved 
by an ethics committee or institutional review board for each site.  Participants provided written 
informed consent.  All authors of this paper had access to the data, participated in drafting or

revising the manuscript, approved the final version for submission, and take responsibility for the 
integrity of the analysis.  
Study Procedures, Assessments, and Statistical Analyses 
Selected safety events of interest included the top 5 most frequent adverse reactions  
listed in the USPI, in addition to malignancy, eczema/dermatitis, pancreatitis, endocarditis, 
delayed fracture healing, serious infections, serious opportunistic infections, and serious cellulitis 
or erysipelas.  The 3-year cumulative incidences of selected AEs of interest for the placebo and 
denosumab groups during FREEDOM, for the placebo and denosumab groups during 
FREEDOM for only those women who entered the Extension, and for the first 3 years of 
denosumab exposure during the FREEDOM Extension for both the Crossover Group (previously 
on placebo) and for the second 3 years of denosumab exposure (years 4-6) for the Long-term 
Group (continuing on denosumab) were determined.  These included only treatment-emergent 
AEs, were based on MedDRA version 13.0, and included women who received ≥ 1 dose of 
investigational product during the respective 3-year periods.  Treatment groups were the original 
randomized assignments in FREEDOM.  To explore the possible impact of loss of susceptible 
subjects, the back pain analysis was repeated in the subset of FREEDOM subjects who enrolled 
into the Extension.  No formal statistical analyses were performed.  
RESULTS 
Subject Disposition and Baseline Characteristics 
Between August 3, 2004 and June 1, 2005, there were 7,808 women who enrolled in the 
FREEDOM study (3902 denosumab, 3906 placebo).  Of these, 5,928 were eligible for 
enrollment in the Extension, and of these, 4,550 (77%) enrolled (2343 long-term, 2207 cross-
over; Figure 1) between August 7, 2007 and June 20, 2008.  By the end of the third year of the

Extension, 3,547 (78%) of those enrolled remained on study.  Characteristics at FREEDOM 
baseline and at the Extension baseline for the Crossover and Long-term Groups for FREEDOM 
and the Extension are shown in Table 1.  As previously reported, placebo and denosumab groups 
from FREEDOM were well balanced at baseline in terms of average age (both 72.3 years), 
prevalent vertebral fractures (23.4% and 23.8%, respectively), lumbar spine BMD T-score (both 
–2.8), and total hip BMD T-score (both –1.9).   
Incidences of the Top 5 Most Frequent Events in the USPI Based on FREEDOM Data 
Incidences of the five most frequent AEs that were imbalanced in favor of placebo during 
FREEDOM (i.e., numerically more frequent in the denosumab subjects) are shown in Table 2.  
Incidence rates for the Crossover Group (years 1-3 on denosumab) and Long-term denosumab 
group (years 4-6 on denosumab) were similar to (hypercholesterolemia, cystitis) or lower than 
(back pain, pain in extremity, musculoskeletal pain) incidence rates for the placebo or 
denosumab groups from FREEDOM.  The incidence of back pain, the most frequent AE from 
FREEDOM, was lower during the Extension than in FREEDOM.  Similar results were observed 
when the back pain analysis was repeated in the subset of FREEDOM subjects who enrolled into 
the Extension (Table 3), suggesting that the loss of susceptible subjects was not likely to be the 
main reason for this observation.  Further analysis suggested that much of this apparent decline 
was due to how back pain was recorded during the Extension.  Specifically, if participants had 
back pain during FREEDOM that did not resolve during FREEDOM and continued into the 
Extension, it was not considered as a new event so they were not counted as having an AE of 
back pain in the Extension unless they reported it again.  When the participants who had back 
pain that continued into the Extension are taken into account (Table 3; n=296 in the Crossover

Group and n=343 in the Long-term Group), then the number of subjects with back pain during 
FREEDOM and the Extension are more comparable but certainly not increased. 
Incidences of Events of Interest 
Other AEs of interest, including malignancy, eczema/dermatitis, pancreatitis, 
endocarditis, and delayed fracture healing; and serious adverse events (SAEs) of interest, 
including infections, opportunistic infections, and cellulitis or erysipelas, occurred at similar or 
lower incidence rates during the first 3 years of the Extension in the Crossover and Long-term 
denosumab groups relative to the placebo or denosumab groups in FREEDOM (Table 4).  For 
example, three of 3879 subjects (0.08%) and 0 of 3883 subjects (0.00%) from the denosumab 
and placebo FREEDOM groups, respectively, were reported to have an AE of endocarditis, 
though none of the 3 had documented bacteremia (see footnotes in Table 4), whereas in the 
Extension there were no AE reports of endocarditis among the 2343 Long-term subjects or 2206 
Crossover subjects.  In FREEDOM, twelve of 3879 subjects from the denosumab group (0.31%) 
and one of 3883 subjects from the placebo group (0.03%) had an SAE of cellulitis or erysipelas, 
whereas in the Extension there were five (0.21%) SAE reports of cellulitis or erysipelas among 
the 2343 Long-term subjects and one SAE report of cellulitis or erysipelas among the 2206 
Crossover subjects (0.05%).(3)  In FREEDOM there were four serious AEs of opportunistic 
infection in the denosumab group (0.10%) and three cases (0.08%) in the placebo group; in the 
Extension there were three such cases (0.13%) in the Long-term denosumab group and two cases 
(0.09%) in the Crossover Group.   
For the denosumab group in FREEDOM, two (0.05%) cases of delayed fracture healing 
were identified through clinical fracture summary case report forms and no additional cases were 
identified via AE reporting; for the placebo group, these numbers were 5 (0.13%) and one

(0.03%).  For the Extension, all delayed fracture healing cases were identified through AE 
reporting, which identified no cases in the Long-term denosumab group and one case (0.05%) in 
the Crossover Group. 
DISCUSSION 
Collection of AEs is standard practice in clinical trials. Especially in the elderly and in 
long-term studies, many if not most AEs could be called “life events” – things that would have 
happened whether or not the person was participating in a clinical trial.  In placebo-controlled 
trials, imbalances in AEs are common; some more frequent in the placebo group, some more 
frequent in the active group.  It may be difficult or impossible to determine which events are 
truly “life events” and which ones represent side effects or concerns regarding tolerability and 
safety. 
In the 3-year double-blind FREEDOM trial, there were numeric differences between 
denosumab and placebo groups for common AEs and imbalances in certain low-frequency AEs 
that might or might not be “adverse reactions” or “side effects.”  We found no evidence for a 
relationship between treatment with denosumab and increasing rates of either low frequency AEs 
or common AEs in patients who were assigned to placebo in the FREEDOM trial and received 3 
years of denosumab in the extension study, and no indication of increased incidence of low 
frequency AEs and common AEs in patients receiving denosumab in Years 4-6 compared with 
Years 1-3.  Age-related events, such as malignancy, would be expected to increase with 
longitudinal follow-up as the population grows older. Our assessment is that this analysis 
provides reassuring information regarding safety and tolerability of both short-term and longer-
term treatment with denosumab.

Advantages of this analysis include the large number of subjects with information 
gathered in a similar fashion over the 6 years of study.  Limitations include the open-label design 
(lack of a continuing placebo group) and the fact that not all qualified FREEDOM participants 
chose to enroll in the Extension. 
In summary, analyses of 3-year safety data from FREEDOM (placebo and denosumab 
groups) and 3-year safety data from the Extension did not show an increasing trend regarding the 
imbalances of low-frequency AEs and some common AEs observed in FREEDOM.
