Hypertensive emergencies are those situations where very high blood pressure (BP) values are associated with acute organ damage, and
therefore, require immediate, but careful, BP reduction. The type of acute organ damage is the principal determinant of: (i) the drug of
choice, (ii) the target BP, and (iii) the timeframe in which BP should be lowered. Key target organs are the heart, retina, brain, kidneys,
and large arteries. Patients who lack acute hypertension-mediated end organ damage do not have a hypertensive emergency and can usu-
ally be treated with oral BP-lowering agents and usually discharged after a brief period of observation.

Introduction
Hypertensive emergencies are a heterogeneous group of acute
hypertensive disorders that require rapid diagnostics and institu-
tion of appropriate therapy to avert or treat progressive organ
dysfunction. The management of hypertensive emergencies is
challenging because immediate treatment depends on the degree
and extent of hypertension-mediated damage to key target
organs. Although solid evidence regarding the optimal treatment
strategy for most hypertensive emergencies is lacking, many stud-
ies have revealed important differences in the effect of different
types of blood pressure (BP)-lowering medication and the magni-
tude
of
acute
BP
reduction
for
different
hypertensive
emergencies. At present, no formal international guidelines or
recommendation exists to help guide clinical decision making. The
aim of this position document is to offer a consensus of the most
important definitions and provide an overview of the management
of hypertensive emergencies. Based on available evidence, we
have also defined areas where further research is needed.
Definitions
An overview of current definitions used for hypertensive emergen-
cies and associated conditions is given in Table 1. Hypertensive emer-
gencies can be classified according to the presence of acute
hypertension-mediated target organ damage.1 In patients with a

hypertensive emergency immediate BP reduction is indicated to limit
extension or promote regression of acute hypertension-mediated
organ damage. The type of target organ damage is the principal deter-
minant of the choice of treatment, target BP, and timeframe by which
BP should be lowered. A typical example of a hypertensive emer-
gency is the coexistence of very high BP values (often >200/
120 mmHg) with advanced retinopathy, acute renal failure, and/or
thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). In general, the term ‘malignant
hypertension’ has been used to describe this condition. This is based
on studies showing limited survival in patients with very severe hyper-
tension and retinal haemorrhages, cotton wools spots, and/or papil-
loedema at a time when treatment of hypertension was not yet
possible. The Task Force recognizes that because of the significantly
improved survival alternative terms to describe this condition may be
more appropriate, although other definitions may need additional val-
idation. Because systemic microcirculatory damage is the pathological
hallmark of malignant hypertension,2 and retinal lesions can be absent
in patients with acute microvascular damage to the kidney and
brain,3,4 acute hypertensive microangiopathy could be considered as an
alternative term. To recognize the high cardiovascular risk that is
associated with the presence of acute and chronic hypertension-
mediated organ damage in these patients it may be of additional
clinical use to stratify patients according to the extent of
hypertension-mediated organ damage.5
Hypertensive encephalopathy occurs in 10–15% of patients pre-
senting with malignant hypertension. However, advanced hyperten-
sive retinopathy may be lacking in up to one-third of these patients.6
Therefore, the diagnosis principally relies on the presence of neuro-
logical symptoms supported by additional imaging. Seizures, lethargy,
cortical blindness, and coma are among the most alarming symptoms,
but more subtle neurological features can be present at an earlier
stage.7 Other examples of hypertensive emergencies are severe
hypertension in patients with intracranial haemorrhage and acute
stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiogenic pulmonary oedema,
acute aortic disease, and severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. A dia-
gram showing the stratification of different hypertensive emergencies
according to the condition or target organ involved is shown in
Figure 1.
The term hypertensive urgency has been previously used to refer
to situations where very high BP values, usually >180/110mmHg,
prompt ED referral, but acute hypertension-mediated target organ
damage is absent. This renders hypertensive urgencies not a separate
entity, but a diagnosis of exclusion. Recent studies have also used a
much broader definition for ‘hypertensive urgency’ to include all
patients with a BP >180/110mmHg presenting at the office.
Cardiovascular risk was not particularly high in these patients and re-
ferral to the ED did not seem to improve cardiovascular outcome
nor BP control after 6 months.8 Because, there is no evidence that
treatment in patients who lack acute hypertension-mediated organ
damage is different from patients with asymptomatic uncontrolled
hypertension, the Task Force considers that it is preferable not to
use the term ‘hypertensive urgency’ and only use hypertensive emer-
gency to refer to those situations where immediate treatment is war-
ranted. This also means that the term hypertensive crisis that was
meant to discriminate between hypertensive urgencies and emergen-
cies becomes obsolete.
Epidemiology
One in every 200 patients presents at the ED with a suspected hyper-
tensive emergency,9 a proportion that has not changed in the past
two decades,10 and seems comparable across continents.11–14 Based
on current definitions, approximately one in every two to three
patients have a hypertensive emergency.9,12,13 In a representative
sample of ED visits in the US, heart failure, stroke, and myocardial in-
farction represented the largest proportion of all hypertensive emer-
gencies, followed by intracranial haemorrhage and aortic dissection,
whereas the incidence of hypertensive emergencies with advanced
retinopathy was quite low.13 However, this may relate to differences
in categorization as other studies using different coding systems have
found much higher incidence rates.14
Despite improved treatment for hypertension in the past decades,
the incidence of hypertensive emergencies has not declined.11,13–15
Limited access to healthcare and non-adherence to antihypertensive
medications frequently contribute to the development of hyperten-
sive emergencies and may, in part, explain the much higher preva-
lence among sub-Saharan African migrants and African Americans.15–
17 This is further supported by data showing that many patients who
present with a hypertensive emergency have not received anti-
hypertensive medication.17,18
Pathophysiology
In patients presenting at the ED with malignant hypertension, second-
ary causes can be found in 20–40% and most often consist of renal
parenchymal disease and renal artery stenosis, whereas endocrine
causes appear to be rare.15,17 However, the majority of patients with
malignant hypertension have unrecognized or uncontrolled essential
hypertension. Many pathophysiological mechanisms are involved in
the development and maintenance of malignant hypertension
(Figure 2), but the initiating events for the sudden escalation in BP are
not completely understood. Marked activation of the renin–angioten-
sin system is often present and associated with the degree of micro-
vascular damage.3 In experimental models, the development of acute
hypertensive microangiopathy is preceded by an increase in renal
vasoconstriction and microvascular damage that leads to activation
of the renin–angiotensin system.19,20 Pressure-induced natriuresis
further contributes to contraction of blood volume and activation of
the
renin–angiotensin
system.21,22

Key messages
• Patients with a hypertensive emergency should be admitted for
close monitoring and, in most cases, treated with intravenous
blood pressure (BP)-lowering agents to reach the recom-
mended BP target in the designated time-frame.
• Patients that lack acute hypertension-mediated end organ dam-
age to the heart, retina, brain, kidneys, or large arteries do not
have a hypertensive emergency and can be treated with oral
BP-lowering agents and usually discharged after a brief period
of observation.

autoregulation failure are at the foundation of the target organ dam-
age associated with malignant hypertension and result in hypertensive
retinopathy, TMA, and encephalopathy, complications that are not
observed in patients with chronic uncontrolled hypertension.
Hypertensive retinopathy
The retinal abnormalities associated with malignant hypertension
consist of flame shaped haemorrhages, cotton wool spots (Grade III)
with or without the presence of papilloedema (Grade IV). These ret-
inal abnormalities are rare in the normal population and, when they
are bilaterally present, highly specific. Because Grade III and IV hyper-
tensive retinopathy have the same pathophysiological background
and carry the same prognosis,23,24 it is justified to stratify patients into
those with and without advanced retinopathy. The presence of
advanced hypertensive retinopathy in patients presenting at the ED
with a suspected hypertensive emergency is associated with much
higher renin–angiotensin system activation and more pronounced
hypertension-mediated organ damage in other areas compared with
patients without these retinal lesions, despite comparable BP values.3

retinopathy is added

Thrombotic microangiopathy
Both high BP and angiotensin II have been associated with activation
of pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant pathways.25,26 Endothelial de-
tachment is one of the pathological hallmarks of hypertensive micro-
angiopathy and is thought to result from high-shear forces.
The subsequent exposure of blood to the subendothelium leads to

Definitions associated with hypertensive emergencies
Hypertensive emergencies are situations where very high BP values are associated with acute hypertension-mediated organ damage, and therefore, re-
quire immediate BP reduction to limit extension or promote regression of target organ damage

Malignant hypertension is a hypertensive emergency characterized by the presence of a severe BP elevation (usually >200/120 mmHg) and advanced ret-
inopathy, defined as the bilateral presence of flame-shaped haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, or papilloedema

cortical blindness and coma, and in the absence of an alternative explanation
Thrombotic microangiopathy: any situation where severe BP elevation coincides with a Coombs-negative haemolysis (elevated lactic dehydrogenase lev-
els, unmeasurable haptoglobin, or schistocytes) and thrombocytopenia in the absence of another plausible cause and with improvement during BP-

coagulation activation, platelet activation, and the formation of a fibrin
network. These result in: (i) the formation of platelet-rich thrombi
with obliteration of the microcirculation and (ii) platelet consumption
and intravascular haemolysis as a result of trapping and destruction of
erythrocytes within the fibrin network. Discrimination from other
causes of TMA such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)
and haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) can be difficult. TMA asso-
ciated with malignant hypertension is usually less severe compared
with patients with TTP and HUS with only moderate thrombocyto-
penia and few schistocytes present in a peripheral blood smear.
Moreover, the coexistence of a severe BP elevation with advanced
retinopathy is usually sufficient to discriminate TMA in patients with
malignant hypertension from other causes of TMA. If needed, meas-
urement of the activity of the von Willebrand factor cleaving prote-
ase, ADAMTS13, may further help to discriminate TTP from
hypertension-induced TMA as very low activity levels are found in
TTP and normal or slightly reduced activity levels are found in malig-
nant hypertension.27 BP-lowering treatment will usually improve
TMA associated with malignant hypertension within 24–48h, where-
as other treatment is required for TTP and HUS.
Hypertensive encephalopathy
When BP is markedly elevated and cerebral autoregulation cannot
prevent a rise in intracranial pressure, cerebral oedema may develop,
especially in the posterior areas of the brain where sympathetic in-
nervation is less pronounced leading to less effective damping of BP
oscillations.28 Histopathological changes in hypertensive encephalop-
athy include cerebral oedema, microscopic haemorrhages, and infarc-
tions.2 Hypertensive encephalopathy is one of the causes of
posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which is
characterized by white matter lesions in the posterior regions of the
brain that are fully reversible with timely recognition and manage-
ment.7 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating increased
signal intensity on T2-weighted or fluid attenuated inversion recovery
(FLAIR)-imaging may be of additional value to confirm the diagnosis,
whereas computerized tomography (CT) is useful to exclude intra-
cerebral haemorrhage. MRI with FLAIR imaging showing the typical
lesions associated with hypertensive encephalopathy is added as
Supplementary material online. Besides acute pressure-mediated
damage to the microcirculation, PRES is also observed in other dis-
eases characterized by acute microcirculatory damage including anti-
phospholipid antibody syndrome, TTP, HUS and the use of cytotoxic
and anti-angiogenic drugs. Hypertension is often present in these
cases, but to a variable degree.
Clinical presentation
There is no specific BP threshold to define hypertensive emergencies
because at the same BP level hypertension-mediated organ damage
can be present or absent.3,29 The rate of BP increase appears to be
more important than the absolute BP value in the development of
hypertensive emergencies. The medical history-taking should focus on
emergency symptoms, possible causes (e.g. non-adherence, dietary
habits), the use of drugs (e.g. steroids, NSAIDs, cyclosporin, sympatho-
mimetics, cocaine, anti-angiogenic therapy), and secondary causes (e.g.
kidney disease, renal artery stenosis). In patients with pre-existing
hypertension, current antihypertensive treatment or treatment with-
drawal, disease duration, and previous BP control should be recorded.
Emergency symptoms include headache, visual disturbances, chest
pain, dyspnoea and focal, or general neurological symptoms. Other
frequent, but less specific, symptoms include dizziness, resulting from
impaired cerebral autoregulation, and gastrointestinal complaints (ab-
dominal pain, nausea and anorexia). A proposed hierarchical strategy
to diagnose patients with a hypertensive emergency based on the
presence of emergency symptoms is added as Supplementary

material online. In patients with hypertensive encephalopathy, the
presence of somnolence, lethargy, tonic–clonic seizures, and cortical
blindness may precede loss of consciousness. Focal neurological
lesions are rare in hypertensive encephalopathy and should raise the
suspicion of intracranial haemorrhage or ischaemic stroke. Physical
examination should focus on cardiovascular and neurological assess-
ment. BP should be measured according to current guidelines in both
arms and at the lower limb to detect pressure differences caused by
aortic dissection. Repeated measurements should be performed
over time, since in a significant proportion of patients, the BP will fall
considerably without antihypertensive medication.30 An overview of
proposed laboratory analysis and diagnostic studies is listed in
Table 2. Diagnostic work up is aimed at finding evidence of acute
hypertension-mediated organ damage and should include an ECG for
the detection of ischaemia. A funduscopic examination should be
performed in case malignant hypertension is suspected. Chest X-ray
or point of care ultrasonography can be used to discriminate cardiac
from non-cardiac dyspnoea.31,32 A transthoracic echocardiogram can
be considered to assess left ventricular structure and function.
Further diagnostic work-up depends on the clinical presentation and
may include brain CT scan or MRI, thoraco-abdominal CT scan and
an abdominal and vascular ultrasound examination.
Acute management of
hypertensive emergencies
There are no randomized controlled trials that have examined differ-
ent treatment strategies for most hypertensive emergencies, except
for acute BP lowering in patients presenting with acute ischaemic or
haemorrhagic stroke. Most strategies are based on consensus from
clinical experience, observations and comparisons of intermediate
outcomes, including the time needed to reach predefined BP targets
and (surrogates of) tissue perfusion.
There
is
general
agreement
that
patients
without
acute
hypertension-mediated organ damage usually can be treated with
oral BP-lowering medication or adaptation of their current BP-lower-
ing medication. Rapid BP lowering is not recommended, as this can
lead to cardiovascular complications.33 This means that a controlled
BP reduction to safer levels without risk of hypotension should be
the therapeutic goal. Hence, short acting nifedipine should not be
used given the rapid BP falls. Among the different oral BP lowering
drugs captopril, labetalol, and nifedipine retard have been proposed,
but limited data are available regarding the optimal treatment in this
situation.34 Once the decision to add medication is taken, an observa-
tion period of at least 2 h is suggested to evaluate BP lowering efficacy
and safety.
Treatment in patients with a hypertensive emergency is driven by
the type of hypertensive organ damage. Acute hypertension-medi-
ated organ damage includes stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic),
acute hypertensive microangiopathy and encephalopathy, cardio-
genic pulmonary oedema, coronary ischaemia, and acute aortic dis-
ease. The treatment goal is to prevent or limit further hypertensive
damage by a controlled BP reduction. In most cases, this can be best
achieved by intravenous medication in a clinical area with facilities for
close haemodynamic monitoring. The swiftness and magnitude of the
BP reduction, as well as the type of BP-lowering medication, is strong-
ly dependent on the clinical context. Rapid BP lowering is required in
patients with pulmonary oedema and acute aortic dissection, where-
as BP-lowering medication is generally withheld in patients with is-
chaemic stroke. Whether BP should be acutely lowered in patients
presenting with severe hypertension and acute intracranial haemor-
rhage is still subject of debate. Although differences in preference and
experience exist with regard to the use of intravenous BP-lowering
medication, most hypertensive emergencies can be treated with ei-
ther labetalol or nicardipine. These drugs are widely available
throughout Europe and the Task Force feels that they should be
included in the essential drug list of each hospital with an emergency
room or intensive care unit. A summary of the treatment of hyper-
tensive emergencies according to affected target organs is given in
Table 3. An overview of recommended drugs that are used for the
treatment of hypertensive emergencies is listed in Table 4.
Malignant hypertension and hypertensive
encephalopathy
Activation of the renin–angiotensin system in patients with malignant
hypertension is highly variable,3 making the BP-lowering response to
renin–angiotensin system blockers unpredictable. Large reductions in
BP (exceeding a >50% decrease in mean arterial pressure) have been
associated with ischaemic stroke and death.35,36 Sodium nitroprus-
side, labetalol, nicardipine, and urapidil all appear to be safe and ef-
fective
for
the
treatment
of
malignant
hypertension.37–39
Fenoldopam, a short acting selective dopamine-1 agonist, and clevidi-
pine, an ultra-short acting calcium-channel blocker for intravenous
use, have been used for the treatment of patients with severe hyper-
tension40,41 but
are
not

available.

administration of ACE-inhibitors is currently used by some teams,42
but must be started at a very low dose to prevent sudden decreases
in BP. Because patients are often volume depleted as a result of pres-
sure natriuresis, intravenous saline infusion can be used to correct
precipitous BP falls if necessary. In patients with hypertensive enceph-
alopathy labetalol may be preferred as it leaves cerebral blood flow
relatively intact for a given BP reduction compared with nitroprus-
side,43 and does not increase intracranial pressure.39 Nitroprusside
and nicardipine can alternatively be used for this type of emergency.
Acute ischaemic and haemorrhagic
stroke
In ischaemic stroke, acute BP reduction within the first 5–7days is asso-
ciated with adverse neurological outcome.44,45 If BP is very high (>220/
120mmHg) or BP-lowering therapy is indicated for another reason
(e.g. acute coronary event, acute heart failure, aortic dissection), it is
probably safe to lower mean arterial pressure by 15% in the first 24h
or faster if deemed necessary by the presence of a concomitant condi-
tion.46 For acute ischaemic stroke and an indication for thrombolytic
therapy, lowering BP to <185mmHg systolic and 110mmHg diastolic
is recommended before thrombolysis is given.46 The same BP criteria
have been used in recent trials that examined the effect of thrombec-
tomy with or without prior thrombolysis.47–49 Acute BP-lowering
treatment to systolic BP <140mmHg in patients with intracerebral
haemorhage reduces intracranial haematoma volume and had a (bor-
derline) significant effect in improving functional outcome in the
Intensive BP Reduction in Acute Cerebral Haemorrhage Trial
(INTERACT)-2,50,51 while the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute
Cerebral Haemorrhage II (ATACH-2) failed to show any benefit of
acute BP-lowering treatment.52 Although both trials had the same BP
targets, there were large discrepancies in the desired BP target and
achieved BP level, which may have mitigated any positive effect. In case
acute reduction in BP is desired, labetalol is the drug of choice with
nicardipine and sodium nitroprusside being useful alternatives.
Acute coronary artery events
For patients presenting with an acute coronary event we also refer to
the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline for the
management of acute coronary syndromes.53 In case severe hyper-
tension is associated with acute coronary syndrome (cardiac ischae-
mia or myocardial infarction), afterload needs to be reduced without
an increase in heart rate in order to decrease myocardial oxygen de-
mand without jeopardizing diastolic filling time. Both nitroglycerine
and labetalol have been used to lower BP in patients with an acute
coronary event.54–56 In comparison with nitroglycerine, sodium
nitroprusside decreases regional blood flow in patients with coronary
abnormalities and increases myocardial damage after acute myocar-
dial infarction.57,58 Additional beta-blockade may be indicated for
patients receiving nitroglycerine, especially if tachycardia is present.
Urapidil may be a good alternative for the management of hyperten-
sion in patients with myocardial ischaemia.59,60
Acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema
In patients with acute pulmonary oedema caused by hypertensive
heart failure, both nitroglycerine and sodium nitroprusside can be
used as they will optimize preload and decrease afterload.61
Nitroprusside is the drug of choice as it will acutely lower ventricular
pre- and afterload. Nitroglycerine may be a good alternative,

although high doses (>200mg/min) may be required to achieve the
desired BP-lowering effect. Compared with nitroglycerine, urapidil
gives a better BP reduction and improvement of arterial oxygen con-
tent without reflex tachycardia.62 Non-invasive continuous positive
airway pressure may be of additional benefit as it acutely reduces pul-
monary oedema and venous return. Concomitant administration
of loop diuretics decreases volume overload and helps to further
lower BP.
Acute aortic disease
In patients with acute aortic disease (dissection or rupture) systolic
BP and heart rate need to be immediately reduced to 120mmHg or
lower and 60b.p.m. or less to reduce aortic wall stress and disease
progression. Beta-blockers are therefore considered first line treat-
ment. Esmolol can be used together with ultra-short acting vasodilat-
ing agents such as nitroprusside or clevidipine.63 Alternatively, bolus
injections of metoprolol or labetalol can be used with the possible
disadvantage that its long half-life prohibits immediate correction of
BP in case of hypotension. For further management of acute aortic
dissection, we refer to the US and European Society of Cardiology
guidelines.64,65
Eclampsia and severe pre-eclampsia
In patients with eclampsia or severe pre-eclampsia (with or with-
out haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets syn-
drome), BP-lowering therapy is given next to intravenous
magnesium Sulfate and delivery needs to be considered after the
maternal condition has stabilized.66 The consensus is to lower sys-
tolic and diastolic BP <160/105 mmHg to prevent acute hyperten-
sive complications in the mother. Both labetalol and nicardipine
have shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of severe
pre-eclampsia if intravenous BP-lowering therapy is necessary.67

In both cases monitoring of foetal heart rate is necessary. To pre-
vent foetal bradycardia the cumulative dose of labetalol should
not exceed 800 mg/24 h. Timely institution of oral BP-lowering
therapy (e.g. methyldopa or long-acting nifedipine) or dose adap-
tation may help to improve BP control and reduces the risk of foe-
tal bradycardia in case labetalol is used. Treatment with
hydralazine is not widely available anymore and not recom-
mended as it has been associated with adverse perinatal out-
comes,68 whereas treatment with nitroprusside is contraindicated
because it carries the risk of foetal cyanide toxicity.
Specific situations
In patients with autonomic hyper-reactivity because of suspected (meth)-
amphetamine or cocaine intoxication, treatment with benzodiazepines
should be initiated first. In case additional BP-lowering treatment is
needed phentolamine, a competitive alpha blocking agent for intraven-
ous use, nicardipine or nitroprusside can be considered. Alternatively,
clonidine can be used, which apart from its sympathicolytic action also
has sedative effects. In case of coronary ischaemia, treatment with nitro-
glycerine and aspirin is recommended next to benzodiazepines. In high-
risk patients with (non-) ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction a
percutaneous coronary intervention should be considered.69 Non-
dihydropyridine calcium channel blocking agents such as diltiazem and
verapamil can be used to treat patients with tachyarrhythmias under
close ECG monitoring. Beta-blocking agents (including labetalol) are
relatively contraindicated because they do not seem to be effective in
reducing coronary vasoconstriction.70,71 In patients with adrenergic
overstimulation because of pheochromocytoma, treatment with labeta-
lol has been associated with acceleration of hypertension in individual
cases.72,73 Phentolamine, nitroprusside, and urapidil have been success-
fully used in the perioperative management of pheochromocytoma.74,75
Nicardipine may also be a good alternative. In patients with a hyperten-
sive emergency elicited by cytotoxic or anti-angiogenic drugs, the
offending agent should be withheld until BP control with oral medica-
tion is achieved. Alternative agents, dose adjustments and follow-up
according to the recommendations by the Cardiovascular Toxicities
Panel of the National Cancer Institute can be considered.76
Prognosis and follow-up
Survival has improved drastically over the past decades,77 but patients
admitted for a hypertensive emergency remain at increased risk of car-
diovascular and renal disease compared with hypertensive patients
who did not experience an emergency.6,78 In patients admitted to the
coronary care unit with a hypertensive emergency, the mortality was
significantly higher (4.6%), when compared with hypertensive patients
without a hypertensive emergency (0.8%).78 Prognostic factors for
major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events in patients presenting
with a hypertensive emergency are elevated cardiac troponin-I levels5
and renal impairment at presentation, whereas BP control and the
amount of proteinuria during follow-up are the main risk factors for
renal survival during follow-up.79,80
Few studies have addressed the optimal follow-up in patients with
previous hypertensive emergency. In the absence of specific data, it
appears reasonable to extrapolate guidelines for severe hypertension
in general.80 In treated patients, improving adherence and persistence
are pivotal in reducing the risk of complications and recurrent hospital-
ization for hypertensive emergencies. Simplification of therapy, when-
ever possible, should be considered. Increasing the dose of existing
antihypertensive medications, adding diuretics, or other antihyperten-
sive agents, preferably as fixed combination therapy, and reinforcing
dietary sodium restriction are all worth considering. In parallel with
treatment intensification and optimization of adherence, in-depth
aetiological work-up and careful assessment of hypertension-mediated
organ damage are recommended.
We suggest frequent, at least monthly, visits in a specialized setting
until target BP is reached, and a protracted follow-up until
hypertension-mediated organ damage (renal function, proteinuria,
left ventricular mass) has regressed. In patients with suboptimally
treated hypertension, suspected non-adherence and hypertension-
mediated organ damage regular visits should be scheduled to tackle
existing burdens by counselling and motivational interviewing with
the aim to improve compliance with the treatment regimen.
Perspectives
The management of hypertensive emergencies is mainly based on
consensus from clinical experience, observations, and comparisons
on intermediate outcomes. The Task Force recognizes that
evidence-based treatment decisions for hypertensive emergencies
can be improved in different areas, including the safety and efficacy of
oral medication when compared with intravenous treatment for the
treatment of malignant hypertension and the optimal BP target for
acute BP-lowering treatment in patients with stroke and acute intra-
cerebral haemorrhage. Further research is needed to assess the im-
pact of acute hypertension-mediated organ damage on future
cardiovascular risk and its therapeutic consequences in these
patients. Finally, hypertensive emergencies as an extreme phenotype
of hypertension and hypertension-mediated complications may help
us to understand more about the complex pathophysiology and aeti-
ology of hypertension in general.
