 REVIEW
Acute effects of muscle stretching on physical performance,
range of motion, and injury incidence in healthy active
individuals: a systematic review
David G. Behm, Anthony J. Blazevich, Anthony D. Kay, and Malachy McHugh
Abstract: Recently, there has been a shift from static stretching (SS) or proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretch-
ing within a warm-up to a greater emphasis on dynamic stretching (DS). The objective of this review was to compare the effects
of SS, DS, and PNF on performance, range of motion (ROM), and injury prevention. The data indicated that SS- (–3.7%), DS- (+1.3%),
and PNF- (–4.4%) induced performance changes were small to moderate with testing performed immediately after stretching,
possibly because of reduced muscle activation after SS and PNF. A dose–response relationship illustrated greater performance
deficits with ≥60 s (–4.6%) than with <60 s (–1.1%) SS per muscle group. Conversely, SS demonstrated a moderate (2.2%) perfor-
mance benefit at longer muscle lengths. Testing was performed on average 3–5 min after stretching, and most studies did not
include poststretching dynamic activities; when these activities were included, no clear performance effect was observed. DS
produced small-to-moderate performance improvements when completed within minutes of physical activity. SS and PNF stretching
had no clear effect on all-cause or overuse injuries; no data are available for DS. All forms of training induced ROM improvements,
typically lasting <30 min. Changes may result from acute reductions in muscle and tendon stiffness or from neural adaptations
causing an improved stretch tolerance. Considering the small-to-moderate changes immediately after stretching and the study limita-
tions, stretching within a warm-up that includes additional poststretching dynamic activity is recommended for reducing muscle
injuries and increasing joint ROM with inconsequential effects on subsequent athletic performance.
Key words: static stretch, dynamic stretch, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, ballistic stretch, flexibility, warm-up.
Résumé : Depuis peu, on utilise plutôt l’
étirement dynamique (« DS ») que l’
étirement statique (« SS ») ou la facilitation
neuromusculaire proprioceptive (« PNF ») au sein d’
une séance d’
échauffement. Cette analyse documentaire se propose de
comparer les effets de SS, DS et PNF sur la performance, l’
amplitude de mouvement (« ROM ») et la prévention de blessures.
D’
après les données, on observe des modifications de performance faibles a
` modérées quand l’
évaluation est réalisée immédi-
atement après la séance d’
étirement : SS (–3,7 %), DS (+1,3 %) et PNF (–4,4 %), et ce, possiblement a
` cause de la diminution de
l’
activation musculaire consécutive a
`SS et PNF. La relation dose-réponse révèle une plus grande baisse de performance quand la
séance de SS par groupe musculaire ≥60 s (–4,6 %) vs. <60 s (–1,1 %). Par contre, SS suscite un gain modéré de performance (2,2 %)
quand le muscle est plus allongé. L’
évaluation est réalisée en moyenne 3-5 minutes post-étirement. La plupart des études
n’
incluent pas des activités dynamiques post-étirement; avec l’
inclusion de ces activités, on n’
observe pas de modification nette
de la performance. DS suscite des gains de performance faibles a
`modérés quand la séance est effectuée dans les minutes suivant
l’
activité. SS et PNF n’
ont pas d’
effet clair sur les blessures dues au surmenage ou toutes causes confondues; il n’
y a pas de
données au sujet de DS. Tous les types d’
entraînement, notamment ceux <30 min présentent des gains de ROM. Les modifica-
tions dépendent peut-être de la diminution ponctuelle de la rigidité tendineuse et musculaire ou d’
adaptations nerveuses
causant une plus grande tolérance a
` l’

séance d’
étirement et des limites des études, l’
inclusion des étirements au sein d’
une séance d’

d’

sans conséquence sur la performance physique subséquente. [Traduit par la Rédaction]

Introduction
The conventional’preactivity routine consists of a submaximal
exercise component (e.g., running, cycling), a bout of muscle
stretching in which muscles are held in an elongated position for
12–60 s (Ebben et al. 2004; Simenz et al. 2005), and a segment of
skill rehearsal (specific warm-up) in which the individuals per-
form dynamic movements similar to those of the sport or event
(Young 2007). Static stretching (SS) is considered an effective
method for increasing joint range of motion (ROM) (Paradisis et al.
2014; Power et al. 2004) and is often thought to improve perfor-
mance (Young and Behm 2003; Young 2007) and reduce the inci-
dence of activity-related injuries (Ekstrand et al. 1983; Hadala and

 Barrios 2009). It is therefore commonly performed in preactivity
routines (Ebben et al. 2005; Simenz et al. 2005). However, recent
evidence suggests that sustained SS could impair subsequent per-
formance (Shrier 2004; Behm and Chaouachi 2011; Kay and
Blazevich 2012), and the perceptions regarding the benefits of SS
in a preactivity routine have changed dramatically. Indeed, the
current evidence indicates significant positive effects of dynamic
forms of stretching (DS). There is also debate as to the benefits
of preactivity stretching with respect to changes in ROM and
injury risk.
Prior reviews have examined SS (Kay and Blazevich 2012), or SS
and DS (Behm and Chaouachi 2011), but no reviews have compre-
hensively investigated the effects of preactivity SS, DS, and propri-
oceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) on subsequent performance,
ROM, and injury incidence. Furthermore, many additional studies
have been published since these reviews. In this review, we pro-
vide an overview of the literature citing the effects of preactivity
stretching on physical performance, injury risk, and ROM, as well
as the physiological mechanisms, with the objective of investigat-
ing, analyzing, and interpreting the acute physical responses to a
variety of stretching techniques to provide clarity regarding the
impact on performance, ROM, and injury.
Materials and methods
Search strategy
This review included studies that examined the acute effects of
SS, DS, and PNF stretching on physical performance, ROM, and
injury incidence. A literature search was performed independently
by the 4 authors using MEDLINE, SPORT Discus, ScienceDirect,
Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases using a number of
key terms: static, dynamic, ballistic stretching, PNF, flexibility,
warm-up, prior exercise, performance, injury, and acute effects.
These key words were used individually and/or were combined.
All references from the selected articles were also cross-checked
by the authors to identify relevant studies that may have been
missed in the search.
Inclusion criteria
Studies examining the acute effects of muscle stretching on
ROM and functional performance were included in the review if
they fulfilled the following selection criteria: (i) the study con-
tained research questions relating to the effect of SS, DS, and/or
PNF stretching on performance, ROM, and injury and used
(ii) healthy and active human subjects (senior adult studies ex-
cluded); (iii) the outcome was a physiological or performance mea-
sure; and (iv) the study was an English language study written
between 1989 (first paper to report poststretch force impairments)
and 2014 and published as an article in a peer-reviewed journal or
conference proceeding (abstracts and unpublished studies were
excluded). The exclusion of non-English articles is a limitation of
this review. Furthermore, studies were delineated with respect to
their internal validity. Selection criteria included studies involving
(i) a control group, (ii) randomized control, and (iii) instruments
with high reliability and validity. Studies reporting the effects of
preactivity muscle stretching on joint ROM and injury incidence
were also examined, without the above criteria being adhered to
(some omissions were made, and these are described in the text).
Mean changes in performance were noted for each study, and
the weighted means (i.e., means adjusted relative to study sample
size) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined. Based on
the prevalence of different magnitudes of change reported in the
literature and an estimated smallest worthwhile change of 0.5%,
we refer to changes of <0.5% as trivial, 0.5%–<2% as small, 2%–<5%
as moderate, 5%–10% as large, and >10% as very large (Hopkins
2004). Effect sizes (ES) describing the magnitude of the differences
between groups or experimental conditions (Cohen 1988) were
calculated for each study for which absolute mean data and SD
statistics were provided; weighted ES and 95% CIs were then de-
termined. Cohen (1988) described ES <0.2 as representing a trivial,
0.2–0.39 as a small, 0.4–0.69 as a moderate, and ≥0.7 as a large
magnitude of change.
Acute effects of muscle stretching
Static stretching
SS involves lengthening a muscle until either a stretch sensa-
tion (Cronin et al. 2008) or the point of discomfort is reached
(Behm et al. 2004) and then holding the muscle in a lengthened
position for a prescribed period of time (Ebben et al. 2004). SS is
commonly used in clinical and athletic environments with the
specific aims of increasing joint ROM and reducing injury risk
(McHugh and Cosgrave 2010). However, a growing body of re-
search has reported negative effects of SS on maximal muscular
performance. Although early reviews accessed relatively few stud-
ies and reported equivocal findings (Rubini et al. 2007; Shrier
2004; Young 2007), more recent reviews encompassing a broader
body of work have highlighted a clear dose–response effect in
which longer stretch durations (e.g., ≥60 s) likely elicit perfor-
mance impairments (Behm and Chaouachi 2011; Kay and Blazevich
2012), which may have important implications for athletic and
clinical performance.
The largest systematic review to date (Kay and Blazevich 2012)
examined 106 SS studies; our searches found a further 19 studies
since 2011 that met our criteria, resulting in 125 studies incorpo-
rating 270 maximal performance measures (Table 1, Supplemen-
tary Table S11 and Supplementary Fig. S1a1) examining the acute
effects of SS on performance (e.g., vertical jump height, sprint
running time, chest and bench press 1-repetition maximum (1-RM),
and maximal voluntary contractions (MVC)). The data revealed 119
significant performance reductions, 145 nonsignificant findings,
and 6 significant improvements after SS. Unfortunately, 42 stud-
ies failed to adequately report either mean changes (16 nonsignif-
icant and 2 significant; 7% of total findings) or pre- and poststretch
means ± SD data (36 significant and 38 nonsignificant; 27% of total
findings), which prevented the inclusion of ES for these measures.
The weighted estimates of the remaining 178 measures revealed a
moderate 3.7% mean performance reduction (Table 1). Thus, al-
though there are some occasions in which large or very large
reductions are reported (e.g., Trajano et al. 2014), SS generally
induces moderate mean (<5%) performance impairments when
testing is performed within minutes of stretching. Given the sub-
stantial between-study differences in poststretch changes (range,
+5% to –20.5%), closer examination of the possible variables that
influence the likelihood and magnitude of performance change
after SS is required.
Dose–response relationship
Several original (Kay and Blazevich 2008; Knudson and Noffal
2005; Robbins and Scheuermann 2008; Siatras et al. 2008) and
review (Behm and Chaouachi 2011; Kay and Blazevich 2012) arti-
cles report a clear dose–response relationship, with ≥60 s of SS
being more likely to result in a significant performance impair-
ment, but shorter durations having little effect (Behm and
Chaouachi 2011; Kay and Blazevich 2012). Thus, studies were sep-
arated into those in which total stretch duration per muscle group
was <60 s and those in which it was ≥60 s. Thirty-nine studies
incorporating 60 maximal performance measures used <60 s of
SS, with 45 nonsignificant changes reported. Statistically significant

 reductions (range, –1.2% to –8.5%) were found in 10 measures,
including sprint running velocity (Fletcher and Jones 2004), jump
height (Hough et al. 2009), and knee extensor MVC (Siatras et al.
2008). Interestingly, significant improvements (range, +1.6% to
+4.1%) were also found in 5 measures, including sprint running
time (Little and Williams 2006), jump height (Murphy et al. 2010b),
and peak cycling power (O’
Connor et al. 2006). However, because
most findings were nonsignificant, it is unsurprising that the
weighted estimates revealed a small 1.1% mean reduction in per-
formance. Ninety-eight studies incorporating 210 maximal perfor-
mance measures using longer stretch durations (≥60 s) revealed
109 significant reductions, 100 nonsignificant findings, and only
1 significant improvement. Given the greater prevalence of signif-
icant reductions, it was not surprising that the weighted mean
change was larger (–4.6%) (Supplementary Table S41). Thus, de-
spite the clear dose–response relationship, the likely effect on
performance was moderate (<5%) even after longer stretch dura-
tions, although in many contexts these impairments will be prac-
tically relevant (e.g., in elite competitions such as sprinting, long
and high jumps, throws (discus, javelin, shot), and others).
Effect of SS in different performance tasks
To determine whether SS produced similar performance changes
in different performance activities, the findings of the studies
were separated into power–speed- or strength-based tasks. Fifty-
two studies reported 82 power–speed-based measures (i.e., jump-
ing, sprint running, throwing), with 56 nonsignificant changes,
21 significant reductions, and 5 significant improvements; collec-
tively, there was a small 1.3% reduction in performance. Seventy-
six studies reported 188 strength-based measures (i.e., 1-RM, MVC),
with 79 nonsignificant changes, 108 significant reductions, and
only 1 significant improvement. There was a moderate reduction
in performance (–4.8%), which indicates a more substantial effect
of SS on strength-based activities. The stretch durations imposed
between activity types were considerably longer for strength-based
activities (5.1 ± 4.6 min) than for power–speed-based activities (1.5 ±
1.6 min), which may explain the greater mean performance reduc-
tions after SS.
Dose–response effect in power–speed tasks
Twenty-six studies incorporating 38 power–speed-based mea-
sures used <60 s of SS, with 29 nonsignificant changes, 4 signifi-
cant reductions, and 5 significant improvements in performance;
collectively, there was a trivial change in performance (–0.15%)
(Supplementary Table S41). It is interesting to note that although
most of the findings were not statistically significant after short-
duration stretching, a greater number of significant improve-
ments than reductions were found in jumping (Murphy et al.
2010b), sprint running (Little and Williams 2006), and cycling
(O’
Connor et al. 2006) performances. Thus, there is no clear effect
of short-duration SS on power–speed-based activities, although
changes may be observed on a study-by-study (and hence, subject-
by-subject) basis. Nonetheless, when 28 power–speed-based studies
(44 measures) using ≥60 s of stretching were examined, 27 non-
significant changes and 17 significant reductions were found, with
no study reporting a significant performance improvement. Com-
pared with shorter-duration stretching, the mean reductions
were marginally greater (–2.6%) (Supplementary Table S41). De-
spite a greater likelihood and magnitude of effect of longer-
duration SS, changes are most likely to be small to moderate.
Dose–response effect in strength tasks
Fourteen studies incorporating 22 maximal strength–based mea-
sures imposed <60 s of SS, with 16 nonsignificant changes, 6 sig-
nificant reductions, and no significant improvements in performance
being reported; collectively, there was a moderate reduction in
performance (–2.8%) (Supplementary Table S41). However, when
strength-based studies using ≥60 s were examined, 72 studies in-
corporating 166 measures with 73 nonsignificant changes and
92 significant reductions were found; only 1 significant improve-
ment in performance was observed. Compared with shorter-
duration stretches, the mean 5.1% reduction was greater. Mean
changes are clearly greater for strength- than for power–speed-
based tasks regardless of duration (although this may be the result
of strength-based studies using substantially longer stretch dura-
tions), and the dose–response effect remains clear.
Dose–response effect for contraction types
Similar moderate-to-large reductions were reported in studies
measuring concentric (–4.4%) and eccentric (–4.2%) strength, with
slightly greater mean reductions in isometric strength (–6.3%).
Studies were further separated based on stretch durations (<60 s
vs. ≥60 s), with a negative dose-dependent effect of stretch on
concentric (<60 s, –1.5%; ≥60 s, –4.8%) and isometric (<60 s, –4.5%;
≥60 s, –6.8%) strength calculated for shorter and longer stretch
durations. respectively. Only 9 studies examined the influence of
SS on eccentric strength, incorporating 23 measurements and all
imposing ≥60 s of stretch. Thus, dose-dependent effects cannot be
examined suitably in this context. Nonetheless, 3 studies (Brandenburg
2006; Sekir et al. 2010; Costa et al. 2013) reported significant re-
ductions in a total of 8 eccentric strength measures, whereas
6 studies (Ayala et al. 2014; Cramer et al. 2006, 2007; Gohir et al.
2012; McHugh and Nesse 2008; Winke et al. 2010) reported no
change in 15 eccentric measures (≥60 s, –4.2%); these small-to-
moderate changes are similar to those observed when isometric
and concentric testing were completed (Supplementary Table S41).
Considering that most muscle strain injuries occur during the
eccentric phase in most activities (Orchard et al. 1997), the limited
number of studies describing the effect of SS on maximal eccen-
tric strength is problematic, especially given that no studies have
examined the effects of shorter stretch durations. The limited
data available on the impact of longer-duration SS on eccentric
strength suggest that a small negative effect may be likely; none-
theless, the influence of shorter durations of SS on eccentric
strength remains to be studied properly.

 Effect of muscle length on SS-induced performance changes
Five studies examined whether the muscle length adopted dur-
ing testing influenced the subsequent strength loss (Nelson et al.
2001; Herda et al. 2008; McHugh and Nesse 2008; McHugh et al.
2013; Balle et al. 2015). Four studies examined the knee flexors
(Herda et al. 2008; McHugh and Nesse 2008; McHugh et al. 2013;
Balle et al. 2015) and the other examined the knee extensors
(Nelson et al. 2001). All 5 studies demonstrated marked strength
loss at short muscle lengths (–10.2%), which contrasted with mod-
erate strength gains at the longest muscle lengths tested (+2.2%).
Notwithstanding this, potential reductions in maximal force may
be notable in activities performed at shorter muscle lengths, yet
performance may be enhanced in activities performed at longer
muscle lengths; this may be of practical importance given that
muscle strain injuries are more likely to occur with the muscle at
a longer, rather than a shorter, length.
Effect of SS in different muscle groups
Lower-limb strength was examined in 67 of the 75 studies in
which strength tests were completed. Overall, similar responses
were observed in the knee extensors (–3.7%), knee flexors (–6.3%),
and plantar flexors (–5.6%). When these studies were further sep-
arated based on the stretch duration (<60 s vs. ≥60 s per muscle
group), evidence for a dose-dependent effect of stretch was ob-
served in the knee extensors (<60 s, –2.6%; ≥60 s, –3.8%), knee
flexors (<60 s, –4.8%; ≥60 s, –6.4%), and plantar flexors (<60 s, –3.5%;
≥60 s, –5.9%). Taken together, these data are indicative of a dose-
dependent effect of stretch, with similar moderate-to-large mean
changes calculated for all muscle groups after shorter and longer
stretch durations, respectively. However, considering the large
95% CIs in several of the findings (Supplementary Table S41), some
caution should be used when interpreting the mean changes re-
ported, because substantial variability exists among studies.
Dynamic stretching
DS involves the performance of a controlled movement through
the ROM of the active joint(s) (Fletcher 2010). For a number of
reasons, DS is sometimes considered preferable to SS in the prep-
aration for physical activity. First, there may be a close similarity
between the stretching and exercise movement patterns (Behm
and Sale 1993). Second, DS activities can elevate core temperature
(Fletcher and Jones 2004), which can increase nerve conduction
velocity, muscle compliance, and enzymatic cycling, accelerating
energy production (Bishop 2003). Third, DS and dynamic activities
tend to increase rather than decrease central drive, as may occur
with prolonged SS (Guissard and Duchateau 2006; Trajano et al.
2013).
An examination of the data (48 studies incorporating 80 measures)
(Table 2, Supplementary Table S21 and Supplementary Fig. S1b1)
revealed that the weighted mean performance enhancement as-
sociated with DS was 1.3%. Unsurprisingly, given the modest
changes, almost one-half of the measurements (37 of 80) demon-
strated trivial magnitude changes, with only 6 studies reporting
subsequent small-to-large relative performance impairments
(Nelson and Kokkonen 2001; Bacurau et al. 2009; Curry et al. 2009;
Barroso et al. 2012; Franco et al. 2012; Costa et al. 2014). Thus,
although there are occasions in which moderate or large improve-
ments in performance are reported, overall, no robust evidence
exists for substantial performance enhancements after DS.
Dose–response relationship for DS
Most studies did not report specific stretch durations but
rather, gave descriptions of the number of exercises, sets, and
repetitions. The weighted mean DS workload was 49.2 repetitions
(95% CI 25.1–73.2). When reported, 11 studies had set durations of
30 s, 8 studies used 15-s set durations, and 4 studies used set
durations of 20, 25, and 40 s, respectively (Table 2 and Supplemen-
tary Table S21). Behm and Chaouachi (2011) reported a DS dose–
response effect in which greater overall peak force and power
improvements were observed when >90 s (7.3% ± 5.3%) vs. <90 s
(0.5% ± 2.3%) of DS was imposed immediately before testing. How-
ever, trivial ES or statistically nonsignificant performance changes
were also elicited by both longer DS durations of 10 min (Needham
et al. 2009) and 15 min (Zourdos et al. 2012) and by 180 repetitions
(Herda et al. 2008), as well as by shorter durations, such as 45 s
(Beedle et al. 2008), 60 s (Samuel et al. 2008), and 150 s
(Amiri-Khorasani et al. 2010), or 2 repetitions of 4 exercises
(Dalrymple et al. 2010). Hence, based on the variability among
studies, it is difficult to demonstrate a dose–response relationship
with DS.
Effect of DS on strength vs. power measures
Force measurements have been performed using isometric or
slower, dynamic movements (e.g., leg extensions, squats); thus,
the test movement velocity does not always correspond with the
DS movement velocity. The data analysis revealed small weighted
changes for both strength-based performances (18 measures) and
power-based tests (51 measures) (Table 2). When evaluated fur-
ther, moderate mean improvements of 2.1% were observed for
jump performances (34 measures), whereas repetitive actions
such as running or sprinting or agility (17 measures) showed a
small 1.4% improvement. The lack of movement velocity similar-
ity between the leg press and DS activities may have been a factor,
with a trivial (4 measures) mean impairment of –0.23%. This may
indicate that part of the positive effect of DS comes from allowing
practice at tasks similar to those in the tests.
Effect of DS by contraction type
Only 11 studies tested specifically during concentric (16 mea-
sures) or eccentric (3 measures) contractions (Table 2 and Supple-
mentary Table S41). There was a trivial average 0.4% increase in
concentric force or torque (Supplementary Table S41). The 3 eccen-
tric measures meeting our criteria had extensive variability (Sup-
plementary Table S41), and thus, the relatively small percentage
decrease (–1.2%) is not truly reflective. Hence, the limited data
indicate generally inconsequential contraction type–dependent
effects of DS on force production.

 Effect of DS movement frequency
The stretch frequency and ROM (and possibly perceived inten-
sity) of stretches may also influence the effect of DS. Some studies
do not report stretch intensity (Manoel et al. 2008; Dalrymple et al.
2010), but some report movement frequency (i.e., the number of
dynamic movements per unit time) (Bacurau et al. 2009; Fletcher
2010). Higher frequencies of DS and ballistic stretching (stretching
using momentum in an attempt to exceed the normal ROM,
which can include bouncing) may augment spindle reflex afferent
excitation of the motor neurons and may theoretically affect sub-
sequent performance (Matthews 1981). Fletcher (2010) reported
that dynamic leg swings at 100·
min−1 resulted in significantly
greater (6.7%–9.1%) countermovement jump and drop jump
heights than did DS activities at 50·
min−1. However, even the
lower-frequency DS (50·
min−1) elicited 3.6% significantly greater
jump performances than did a no-stretch condition. Studies com-
bining both slow and faster rates of dynamic movements in the
same preactivity routine have reported significant improvements
in vertical jump height (4.9%) (Hough et al. 2009), hamstrings and
quadriceps eccentric and concentric torque (�7%–15%) (Sekir et al.
2010), and leg extension power (10.1%) (Yamaguchi et al. 2007).
However, Franco and colleagues (2012) combined slow and fast
movements (3 exercises, with 5 slow plus 5 fast movements) and
reported a decrease in Wingate peak power and time to peak
power (mean and % changes were not provided). Cycling is not a
DS-shortening cycle movement, so this negative result is con-
sistent with the previously discussed potential for a movement
pattern–specific effect of DS.
Inconsistent results are reported with the use of ballistic or
bobbing (bounce through the movement at the end of ROM)
movements. Both Bacurau and colleagues (2009) and Nelson and
Kokkonen (2001) used 20 min of ballistic stretch activities and
reported a 2.2% decrease in leg press 1-RM and a �5%–7% decrease
in knee flexion and extension 1-RMs, respectively (likely fatigue
related). Other studies imposing shorter durations of ballistic
stretching or bobbing actions at end ROM have reported no sig-
nificant effects (Bradley et al. 2007; Samuel et al. 2008). Cumula-
tively, the data show a tendency toward an increase in performance
with faster and/or more intense ballistic stretches, but substantial
variability exists among studies and with regard to performances
in different tests within studies, so a firm conclusion cannot be
drawn.
Effect of magnitude of DS movement on performance
The ROMs adopted during DS vary considerably among studies,
with authors describing “ROM” as a DS through the active ROM,
maximal or end of ROM, exaggerated movements, bobbing,
bouncing, ballistic bouncing movements (indeterminate ROM ex-
tent), mild stretch, and others. Most studies report that move-
ments were performed through a full or nearly full active ROM.
Stretches performed through the active or maximal ROM resulted
in trivial and nonsignificant performance changes (Beedle et al.
2008; Herda et al. 2008; Curry et al. 2009; Amiri-Khorasani et al.
2010; Chaouachi et al. 2010; Paradisis et al. 2014), performance
enhancements (Fletcher and Anness 2007; Yamaguchi et al. 2007;
Chaouachi et al. 2010), or performance impairments (Curry et al.
2009). Two studies reporting performance impairments required
subjects to perform small ballistic bouncing or bobbing move-
ments near the end ROM (Nelson and Kokkonen 2001; Bacurau
et al. 2009). Studies using “exaggerated movements”, which may
or may not reach the end of the active ROM, report both perfor-
mance impairments (Costa et al. 2014) and no significant effect
(Dalrymple et al. 2010). Thus, there is no identifiable trend as to
the effects associated with DS through a full (maximal) or nearly
full (submaximal) ROM.
PNF stretching
PNF stretching incorporates SS and isometric contractions in a
cyclical pattern to enhance joint ROM, with 2 common techniques
being contract relax (CR) and contract relax agonist contract
(CRAC) (Sharman et al. 2006). The CR method includes an SS phase
followed immediately by an intense, isometric contraction of the
stretched muscle, with a further additional stretch of the target
muscle completed immediately after contraction cessation. On
the other hand, the CRAC method requires an additional contrac-
tion of the agonist muscle (i.e., opposing the muscle group being
stretched) during the stretch, prior to the additional stretching of
the target muscle (Sharman et al. 2006). Despite its efficacy in
increasing ROM, PNF stretching is rarely used in athletic preactiv-
ity routines, possibly because (i) there is normally a requirement
for partner assistance, (ii) it may be uncomfortable or painful, and
(iii) muscle contractions performed at highly stretched muscle
lengths can result in greater cytoskeletal muscle damage (Butterfield
and Herzog 2006) and speculatively an increased risk of muscle
strain injury (Beaulieu 1981), although no data clearly support
this. Notwithstanding these potential limitations, PNF stretching
remains an effective practice and its impact on muscular perfor-
mance is worthy of examination.
Relatively few studies report the effects of PNF stretching, and
no comprehensive or meta-analytical review exists that evaluates
the effects of PNF stretching. This is surprising because PNF is a
highly effective stretching method for ROM gain and includes an
SS phase within the protocol and thus may be predicted to influ-
ence physical performance. Our search revealed 14 studies report-
ing the effects of PNF stretching on performance, with 11 using the
CR method and 3 using CRAC. Because of the limited number of
studies using CRAC, and the differences in methodology across
stretching modes, we have reported only on CR stretching. Eleven
studies incorporated 23 performance measures (Table 3, Supple-
mentary Table S31, and Supplementary Fig. S1c1) examining the
acute effects of CR PNF stretching on maximal muscular strength
and power performance. Seventeen nonsignificant findings and
6 significant performance reductions were reported; no studies
reported a performance improvement immediately after PNF
stretching. Although the majority of studies reported no signifi-
cant change in performance, our weighted estimate showed a
4.4% mean reduction in performance (Table 3). Thus, although
notable performance impairments have been reported, PNF
stretching generally induces small-to-moderate changes in perfor-
mance that may be meaningful only in some clinical or athletic
environments.
Dose–response relationship
The limited number of studies imposing PNF stretching, cou-
pled with the relatively small range of stretch durations (5–50 s),
made an examination of the dose–response relationship impossi-
ble. The CR routine was normally repeated 2–5 times, providing
an average SS phase of 2.5 ± 2.9 min. Based on our report of the
effects of SS using durations >60 s, it may be concluded that the
deficit induced by SS (–4.6%) is similar to that induced by PNF
stretching (–4.4%). However, 9 of the 11 studies incorporating PNF
stretching also compared the results with an SS condition, which
enabled a direct comparison of the 2 stretch modes and elimi-
nated stretch duration as a confounding factor. These studies
showed that SS had a smaller negative impact (–2.3%) than did PNF
stretching (–6.4%), indicating a more substantive effect after PNF.
Regardless, the data are indicative of a small-to-large effect of
PNF stretching on maximal muscular performance.
Effect of PNF on power–speed tasks
Three studies reported 4 vertical jump performances, including
squat and countermovement jump heights. One study reported a
moderate-to-large and statistically significant reduction (–5.1%) in
jump height (Bradley et al. 2007); however, this effect was no

 longer observed at 15 min after stretch; no significant difference
was reported in the remaining 2 studies (Christensen and
Nordstrom 2008; Young and Elliott 2001). One study (Bradley et al.
2007) examining 2 jump measures did not report either the mean
changes or pre- and poststretch results, which prevented the cal-
culation of ES for these measures. Nonetheless, analysis of the
available data revealed a small mean reduction (–1.6%); thus, any
impact on jump performance is likely to be trivial to small (Sup-
plementary Table S41).
Effect of PNF on strength tasks
Eight PNF studies examined 19 strength-based measures; 16 non-
significant findings and only 3 significant losses were reported.
One study (Reis et al. 2013) did not report percentage changes,
which would have enabled weighted estimate calculation, whereas
another study (Balle et al. 2015) did not report pre- and poststretching
results, which would have enabled ES calculation. Nonetheless,
the weighted estimate for the available findings revealed a large
mean performance reduction (–5.5%); however, large 95% CIs (Sup-
plementary Table S41) indicate a highly variable impact on mus-
cular strength that may be practically meaningful yet small in
comparison to interindividual variability in strength scores.
Effect of PNF on different contraction types
Five studies reported 11 findings pertaining to concentric
strength with a moderate mean reduction (–2.1%) observed. Four
studies reported 8 findings pertaining to isometric strength with
a larger but variable effect (–8.3%) (Supplementary Table S41).
However, 1 study (Reis et al. 2013) did not report percentage
change data for its nonsignificant finding, whereas another study
(Balle et al. 2015) did not report pre- and poststretching results,
which would have enabled ES calculation. Thus, caution should
be used when interpreting our estimate given the proportionally
large number of studies omitted from the analysis. Interestingly,
no studies were found that examined the influence of PNF stretch-
ing on eccentric strength. Considering that eccentric strength
(Orchard et al. 1997) is a factor purported to influence muscle
strain injury risk, and that most muscle strain injuries occur dur-
ing the eccentric phase of activities, the influence of PNF stretch-
ing on eccentric strength requires further investigation.
Stretching-induced force loss mechanisms
Understanding the mechanisms underpinning the stretch-
induced force loss allows us to make sense of between-study dif-
ferences in results and to develop strategies to overcome any force
and/or performance reductions. Minimal evidence has been pre-
sented as to how DS affects the neuromuscular system, although
one may speculate that its effects are similar to those of other
dynamic warm-up methods (e.g., Bishop 2003); thus, this section
focuses on the effects of SS and PNF stretching.
Changes in tendon stiffness and the force–length
relationship
Acute muscle stretching has been hypothesized as reducing
tendon stiffness, forcing the muscle to work at shorter and
weaker (according to its force–length relationship) lengths (Cramer
et al. 2007; Fowles et al. 2000; Nelson et al. 2001; Weir et al. 2005).
Indeed, several studies have demonstrated greater stretch-induced
strength loss at short vs. long muscle lengths (e.g., Nelson et al.
2001; Herda et al. 2008), although this effect may also be explained
by muscle length–specific reductions in central (neural) drive (see
Reduced central (efferent) drive). Evidence against this hypothesis
includes data showing that gastrocnemius works at the same
length after acute muscle stretching despite a reduction in peak
force production (Kay and Blazevich 2009); thus, muscle length
did not cause the force decline. In addition, potential reductions
in muscle length would not affect, or may even increase, force
production in muscles working at optimum length or on the de-
scending limb of their force–length relation. Given our current
understanding, changes in muscle length are unlikely to be an
important mechanism influencing the force reduction after SS.
Stretch-induced contractile “fatigue” or damage
Mechanical stretch imposed on the muscle–tendon unit could
cause damage within the muscle itself, thus reducing contractile
force capacity (i.e., length at optimum force) (Brooks et al. 1995).
Decreases in electrically stimulated force after acute plantar
flexor stretches (Trajano et al. 2013, 2014) may be considered evi-
dence for the hypothesis; however, these reductions were dispro-
portionally smaller than, and not correlated with, the loss of
voluntary force and were not correlated with the recovery of force
after stretch (Trajano et al. 2014). As yet, practically meaningful
muscle damage has not been reported after SS in humans.
Muscle stretching may also reduce blood flow and tissue oxygen
availability, causing an accumulation of metabolic end products
and/or reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (Palomero et al. 2012).
In animal studies, passive stretching has increased nitric oxide
(Tidball et al. 1998) and reactive oxygen species (Palomero et al.
2012) production. No direct measurements have been made in
humans; however, Trajano and colleagues (2014) observed that
intermittent stretching (15 s rest between 5 stretches of 1 min
each) caused notable perfusion and reperfusion of plantar flexor
muscles and a greater magnitude of and longer-lasting force loss
than did the same volume of continuous stretching, even though
the absolute level of deoxygenation was greater during continu-
ous stretches. Thus, ischemia–reperfusion cycles induced by inter-
mittent stretching appear to be particularly problematic. The
mechanism by which these cycles impair force production is not
known specifically, but it appears not to be caused by a decrease in
intracellular free calcium concentration (Trajano et al. 2014).

 Diminished electromechanical coupling
Theoretically, impaired sarcolemmal action potential transmis-
sion may impair calcium release during muscle activation. Eguchi
and colleagues (2014) observed decreases in electromyography
(EMG) signal frequency during 30-s low-intensity (submaximal)
deltoid contractions after 30-s SS or DS; however, it is not clear
whether this indicates a change in sarcolemmal transmission or a
shift in the motor unit recruitment pattern towards lower-threshold
(e.g., type I) motor units. Furthermore, Trajano and colleagues
(2014) reported no change in M-wave amplitude after 5 plantar
flexor stretches of 1 min each. No other studies have made such
measurements, and no studies have used other methods such as
assessment of action potential velocity or EMG frequency charac-
teristics during maximal, or maximally fatiguing, contractions.
Changes in tendon stiffness also speculatively influence electro-
mechanical delay (Cresswell et al. 1995; Waugh et al. 2013, 2014)
and thus reduce the rate of force production. However, despite
correlations being observed between tendon stiffness (or changes
with exercise training) and electromechanical delay (or its change
with training) (Waugh et al. 2013, 2014), this effect has not been
shown explicitly. Reductions in tendon stiffness are also thought
to affect the rate of force development (Bojsen-Møller et al. 2005;
Waugh et al. 2013). However, small changes in tendon stiffness
(e.g., a 30% increase after strength training in children) do not
appear to influence the rate of force development (Waugh et al.
2014) so it is unlikely that the changes in tendon stiffness elicited
by acute muscle stretching meaningfully influence it.
In addition, muscle stretching theoretically could reduce the
force transfer efficiency from the contractile component to the
skeleton (e.g., endo-, epi-, and perimysial transmission) (Huijing
1999) alongside the stretch-induced reductions in muscle stiffness
(Kay and Blazevich 2009; Morse et al. 2008). However, this possi-
bility has not been assessed directly in humans.
Reduced central (efferent) drive
Associations between reductions in EMG amplitude and maxi-
mal voluntary force production have been observed (Fowles et al.
2000; Kay and Blazevich 2009). However, others report no changes
in EMG amplitude (e.g., Herda et al. 2008; Ryan et al. 2008), so a
consensus cannot be reached regarding changes in central drive
as assessed using EMG. Nonetheless, reductions in the EMG/M
ratio (reducing peripheral influences on EMG amplitude), volun-
tary activation levels (measured using the interpolated twitch
technique), and V-wave amplitude (a variant of the H reflex pro-
viding evidence of voluntary drive to the motoneurons) have been
observed after stretch (Trajano et al. 2013, 2014). Furthermore,
these variables increased in the early period (<15 min) after
stretch, and their changes were correlated with the changes in
maximal force production (e.g., Trajano et al. 2013, 2014). Indeed,
the simultaneous recoveries of voluntary force and central drive
(EMG) have been observed in other studies. Thus, changes in cen-
tral drive appear to underpin changes in muscular force produc-
tion after stretching.
Central drive can be modulated by sensory (afferent) inputs
(Matthews 1981), which may modulate supraspinal outflow from
the motor cortex. Alternatively, reductions in muscle spindle–
dependent feedback to the motoneuron pool (i.e., at the spinal
cord), reductions in intrafusal (muscle spindle) discharge leading
to a reduction in voluntary drive onto the motoneurons via the
�-loop, altered excitability of spinal interneurons (facilitatory and
inhibitory), or a change in excitability of the postsynaptic mem-
brane may contribute. Recent evidence suggests that muscle
stretching can reduce persistent inward current formation at the
motoneurons (Trajano et al. 2014), which probably occurs via a
reduced muscle spindle facilitation of the motoneuron. Thus,
changes at the spinal level appear to be closely linked with the
reduction in muscle force. Given that inward currents are ampli-
fied by central nervous system stimulants (e.g., caffeine), emo-
tional arousal, and the simultaneous contraction of other muscles,
such findings hint at potential interventions that may reduce the
loss of force after muscle stretching. Persistent inward current
formation was also greater at longer than at shorter muscle
lengths, which may partly explain the greater loss of muscle force
at shorter muscle lengths (Herda et al. 2008; McHugh et al. 2013).
Acute effects of SS, DS, and PNF on joint ROM
Although SS, DS, and PNF can significantly increase passive
ROM (Sharman et al. 2006), whether PNF, SS, or DS provide greater
acute ROM benefits is disputed. A number of studies report
greater ROM improvements after PNF compared with SS within a
single session (Etnyre and Lee 1988; Ferber et al. 2002; O’
Hora et al.
2011). On the other hand, SS has also been shown to provide ROM
increases similar to those of PNF within a single session (Condon
and Hutton 1987; Maddigan et al. 2012). There is also conflict in the
DS literature, with some studies reporting that an acute bout of
DS provides either similar (Beedle and Mann 2007; Perrier et al.
2011) or greater (Duncan and Woodfield 2006; Amiri-Khorasani
et al. 2011) increases in flexibility than does SS, whereas many
other studies have reported that DS was not as effective as SS
within a single preactivity routine (Samuel et al. 2008; Bacurau
et al. 2009; Sekir et al. 2010; Barroso et al. 2012; Paradisis et al.
2014). Few studies have compared PNF with DS; however, Wallin
and colleagues (1985) showed greater ROM increases after PNF
(11%–24%) than after ballistic stretching (3%–7%) over 14 training
sessions. Small-to-large relative ROM increases have been re-
ported to persist for 5 (Whatman et al. 2006), 10 (Behm et al. 2011),
30 (Fowles et al. 2000), 90 (Knudson 1999), and 120 min (Power
et al. 2004) after SS. Unfortunately, ROM changes after DS and PNF
have been monitored only for a maximum of 10 min after stretch.
Although it is not possible to confidently rank stretching methods
on their effectiveness in increasing flexibility, all 3 forms of
stretching have been shown to increase ROM.
ROM mechanisms after acute muscle stretching
SS, DS, and PNF stretching have distinct loading characteristics
that likely influence the specific mechanisms responsible for
acute increases in ROM. However, our understanding of the un-
derlying mechanisms remains limited. Acute increases after SS
have been attributed largely to concomitant increases in the ca-
pacity to tolerate loading prior to stretch termination (i.e., stretch
tolerance) (Magnusson et al. 1996a) and/or to changes in mechan-
ical properties (i.e., reduced muscle stiffness) (Morse et al. 2008).
However, although both mechanisms are reported commonly,
substantial differences in study methodology (duration, intensity,
muscle group, subject demographics) limit our ability to fully
determine the importance of these mechanisms to increases in
ROM after SS.
Historically, autogenic inhibition has been theorized to explain
PNF’
s superior efficacy to enhance ROM (Hindle et al. 2012), be-
cause the intense isometric contraction phase was thought to
increase Ib muscle afferent activity. This activity may hyperpolar-
ize the dendritic ends of spinal �-motoneurons of the stretched
muscle, minimizing or removing the influence of stretch-induced
type Ia–mediated reflexive activity (McNair et al. 2001), enabling
further increases in ROM. However, there is no direct evidence of
a causal relationship between reflexive activity and ROM, and
several studies report increased resting EMG activity immediately
after the contraction phase of a PNF stretch (Magnusson et al.
1996a; Mitchell et al. 2009). Consequently, debate exists as to the
involvement of autogenic inhibition (Hindle et al. 2012; Sharman
et al. 2006). However, because PNF stretching includes an SS
phase, SS and PNF likely share common mechanisms underpin-
ning acute increases in ROM. In fact, increased stretch tolerance
(Mitchell et al. 2007) and reduced stiffness (Magnusson et al. 1996b)
have both been reported after PNF stretching. However, distinct

 tissue property changes are reported after PNF, with reductions in
tendon stiffness also reported (Kay et al. 2015), although changes
in stiffness were not correlated with changes in ROM. Thus, it is
likely that similar underlying mechanisms are associated with
changes in ROM after PNF and SS modalities.
DS involves repeated cyclical loading and unloading of the mus-
culature, often for several minutes (Fletcher 2010). Despite the
ability of DS to increase ROM, there have been limited attempts to
identify the influential mechanisms, and no clear mechanism(s)
have been identified. However, repetitive lengthening of the mus-
culature can increase muscle fibre temperature, decrease viscos-
ity, and increase extensibility in animal models (Mutungi and
Ranatunga 1998), with 1 study reporting reductions in passive
muscle stiffness with increased ROM after DS in humans (Herda
et al. 2013). Thus, limited data exist describing the mechanisms for
ROM enhancement after DS, and it is not known whether changes
in stretch tolerance are as influential as in SS and PNF forms of
stretching.
Influence of preactivity stretching on injury risk
Effect of preactivity stretching on subsequent injury risk
Stretching is generally incorporated into the preactivity routine
in numerous sports. For the purposes of this review, studies re-
porting the effects of stretching that were performed only after
exercise, or as part of a holistic training program not specifically
before exercise, were not included. All 12 studies used some type
of SS or PNF stretching, with none using DS (Supplementary
Tables S5a and S5b1).
Eight studies showed some effectiveness of stretching, whereas
4 showed no effect. Of practical importance, there was no evi-
dence that stretching negatively influences injury risk. Several of
the studies had design limitations that made it difficult to confi-
dently attribute an apparent injury reduction effect specifically to
the preactivity muscle stretching.
The 12 studies were assessed with respect to 5 potentially con-
founding factors summarized below.
Study design (randomized trials vs. other study designs)
Although a lower proportion of randomized (4 of 7) than non-
randomized (4 of 5) trials showed a benefit of stretching with
respect to injury reduction (mostly muscle injuries), it is notable
that the majority of randomized trials showed some efficacy.
Stretch duration (short vs. long stretch durations)
Five studies imposed stretching interventions lasting ≤5 min.
Of these, 2 showed a benefit of stretching, 1 of which was a survey-
driven retrospective correlation analysis, indicating that ham-
string injury rates were lower in teams reporting the use of
stretching (Dadebo et al. 2004). Six studies imposed total stretch
durations >5 min, with 5 showing some benefit of stretching with
respect to injury risk. One study did not report stretch duration.
Thus, longer (total)-duration stretching interventions may have a
greater potential to decrease injury risk.
Three studies imposed stretches on single muscle groups (2 on
hamstrings, 1 on plantar flexors). The other 9 studies imposed
stretches on multiple muscle groups. For example, Pope and col-
leagues (2000) imposed single 20-s stretches on bilateral gastroc-
nemius, soleus, hamstrings, quadriceps, hip adductors, and hip
flexors. Thus, the total stretch time for single muscle group stud-
ies is not directly comparable with that of multiple muscle group
studies. However, some stretches targeting a single muscle group
(e.g., straight leg raise hamstring stretch) may also stretch ipsilat-
eral (e.g., calf) and contralateral (e.g., hip flexors) muscle groups.
Type of sport–activity (endurance activities with a predominance
of overuse injuries vs. sprinting sports with a high prevalence of
muscle injuries)
Five studies examined injury rates in endurance sports or mili-
tary training in which there was a predominance of overuse inju-
ries. Only 2 of the studies showed a benefit of stretching, with
reduced muscle injuries being the common finding. Six studies
involved sprint running–type sports, with fewer muscle injuries
reported in 5 of the 6 studies with stretching (1 addressed ankle
sprains only). The 1 longitudinal study (Hadala and Barrios 2009),
completed on yachting crews, was not included in this compari-
son because it did not fit either activity classification (it showed a
benefit of stretching on muscle injuries). Overall, the current re-
search indicates that preactivity stretching may be beneficial for
injury prevention in sports with a sprint running component but
not in endurance-based running activities (including military
training) with a predominance of overuse injuries.
Stretching with vs. without warm-up
Based on the current body of research, it is not possible to
comment on the role of stretching with respect to injury preven-
tion when performed with vs. without warm-up. However, be-
cause muscle stretching and warm-up may have similar effects on
muscle viscoelastic properties (Taylor et al. 1997), it is possible that
both may influence injury risk, and this would not be noticeable
without a nonstretching, non-warm-up control group.
All-cause injury rate vs. specific injury rates
Eight studies examined all types of injuries or all lower-
extremity injuries. The other 4 studies examined specific injuries,
(2 studied hamstring strains, 1 studied all lower-extremity muscle
strains, 1 studied ankle sprains). Of the 8 studies examining the
effect of stretching on total injury rates, only 2 reported a benefit
of stretching (Ekstrand et al. 1983; Hadala and Barrios 2009).
One study reported a benefit of stretching for ankle sprains
(McKay et al. 2001); however, this was a retrospective survey study,
and 4 randomized controlled trials have shown no benefits of
stretching on the rates of ankle sprains (Amako et al. 2003; Pope
et al. 1998, 2000; van Mechelen et al. 1993).
Six studies specified the effects of stretching on the prevalence
of acute muscle injuries. From these studies, it was possible to
compute the relative risk of sustaining an acute muscle injury
associated with stretching vs. not stretching (Supplementary
Table S61). Taken together, these studies indicate a 54% risk reduc-
tion in acute muscle injuries associated with stretching.
One study also indicated that stretching was associated with a
reduction in “bothersome soreness” (Jamtvedt et al. 2010). How-
ever, most research has demonstrated that stretching prior to
exercise is ineffective in reducing soreness or other symptoms of
muscle damage (Black and Stevens 2001; Gulick et al. 1996; High
et al. 1989; Johansson et al. 1999; Khamwong et al. 2011; Lund et al.
1998; McHugh and Nesse 2008), with 1 recent exception showing
some benefit of stretching (Chen et al. 2014).
Limitations
A number of limitations were encountered when reviewing this
literature. They included issues related to internal validity (i.e.,
bias caused by expectancy effects) and external validity (i.e., eco-
logical validity of stretch durations and warm-up components,
description detail of stretches, reporting bias against nonsignifi-
cant results). A detailed discussion is provided as a digital supple-
ment (Supplementary Appendix S71).
Conclusions
SS- (–3.7%), DS- (+1.3%), and PNF- (–4.4%) induced performance
changes were typically small to moderate in (relative) magnitude
when testing was performed soon after the stretching. An initial
assumption based on the overall results may be to not recom-

 mend SS or PNF stretching within pre-event warm-up activities
when test performance is required immediately after stretching.
However, the average poststretching measurement time was
3–5 min, which does not coincide with typical stretching-to-
performance durations of >10 min in many circumstances (e.g.,
sports competitions). In studies that conducted tests >10 min after
stretching, performance changes were typically statistically triv-
ial unless extreme stretch protocols were used (Fowles et al. 2000;
Power et al. 2004).
SS impairments were more substantial with ≥60 s (–4.6%) vs. <60 s
(–1.1%) of stretching for each muscle group. Dose–response relation-
ships could not be established firmly for PNF or DS. There is some
evidence that >2 min and faster frequencies of DS provide a
greater performance increase. Thus, longer-duration SS and PNF
may be done well before (e.g., >10 min) task performance is re-
quired to allow effects to resolve, but DS may be performed closer
to the performance. There were no significant response differ-
ences when stretching was based on muscle contraction type or
muscle group stretched. Because muscle strain injuries are more
likely to occur with the muscle at a longer length, the very large
performance reductions (–10.2%) at short muscle lengths, but
moderate performance increases (2.2%) at longer muscle lengths,
could influence the decision to use SS. Although no significant
differences were observed between testing types for DS and PNF,
there were greater SS-induced deficits in strength (–4.8%) vs.
power–speed (–1.3%) tests. There was some evidence of a move-
ment pattern–specific effect of DS, because jump performance
(2.1%) improved to a greater extent than tests involving slower,
uniarticular concentric (0.4%) or eccentric (–1.2%) contractions.
The few studies that included poststretching dynamic activity
(i.e., Murphy et al. 2010a; Samson et al. 2012) did not show sub-
stantial evidence for an effect on performance. There is no evi-
dence as to whether there are any psychological or group–team
cohesion influences on muscle stretching. All forms of muscle
stretching have been shown to provide a significant acute ROM
benefit. Despite some evidence for a greater ROM benefit with
PNF, a confident conclusion cannot be reached based on the avail-
able evidence.
SS and PNF show no overall effect on all-cause injury or overuse
injuries, but there may be a benefit in reducing acute muscle
injuries with running, sprinting, or other repetitive contractions.
Limited data indicate a potentially greater effect of SS and PNF on
injury risk for longer stretch durations (>5 min of total stretch
time of task-related multiple muscle groups). There is conflicting
evidence as to whether stretching in any form before exercise can
reduce exercise-induced muscle soreness. Hence, stretching in
some form appears to be of greater benefit than cost (in terms of
performance, ROM, and injury) but the type of stretching chosen,
and the make-up of the stretch routine, will depend on the con-
text within which it is used.

recommendations based on this stretch literature review are
