ABSTRACT
Objective
To prospectively validate the Predicting Out-of-OFfice 
Blood Pressure (PROOF-BP) algorithm to triage 
patients with suspected high blood pressure for 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in 
routine clinical practice.
DeSiGN
Prospective observational cohort study.
SettiNG
10 primary care practices and one hospital in the UK.
ParticiPaNtS
887 consecutive patients aged 18 years or more 
referred for ABPM in routine clinical practice. All 
underwent ABPM and had the PROOF-BP applied.
MaiN OutcOMe MeaSureS
The main outcome was the proportion of participants 
whose hypertensive status was correctly classified 
using the triaging strategy compared with the 
reference standard of daytime ABPM. Secondary 
outcomes were the sensitivity, specificity, and area 
under the receiver operator characteristic curve 
(AUROC) for detecting hypertension.
reSultS
The mean age of participants was 52.8 (16.2) years. 
The triaging strategy correctly classified hypertensive 
status in 801 of the 887 participants (90%, 95% 
confidence interval 88% to 92%) and had a sensitivity 
of 97% (95% confidence interval 96% to 98%) and 
specificity of 76% (95% confidence interval 71% to 
81%) for hypertension. The AUROC was 0.86 (95% 
confidence interval 0.84 to 0.89). Use of triaging, 
rather than uniform referral for ABPM in routine 
practice, would have resulted in 435 patients 
(49%, 46% to 52%) being referred for ABPM and 
the remainder managed on the basis of their clinic 
measurements. Of these, 69 (8%, 6% to 10%) would 
have received treatment deemed unnecessary had 
they received ABPM.
cONcluSiONS
In a population of patients referred for ABPM, this new 
triaging approach accurately classified hypertensive 
status for most, with half the utilisation of ABPM 
compared with usual care. This triaging strategy 
can therefore be recommended for diagnosis or 
management of hypertension in patients where ABPM 
is being considered, particularly in settings with 
limited resources.
Introduction
Hypertension is an important risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease,1 the leading cause of morbidity 
and mortality worldwide.2 It can be managed effectively 
with antihypertensive drugs.3 Ambulatory blood 
pressure monitoring (ABPM) is the reference standard 
for confirming a diagnosis of hypertension and is now 
commonly used before initiation of treatment.3 This is 
because ambulatory blood pressure has been shown to 
estimate mean blood pressure more accurately and to 
correlate better with a range of cardiovascular outcomes 
than blood pressure measured in a clinic setting.4-6 
Indeed, clinic blood pressure often misclassifies true 
mean blood pressure owing to white coat hypertension 
(high clinic blood pressure with normal ambulatory 
blood pressure) or the converse, masked hypertension 
(high ambulatory blood pressure with normal clinic 
blood pressure; see supplementary eFigure 1).7-9
Current strategies for the diagnosis of hypertension 
recommended by the UK National Institute for Health 
and Care Excellence and the American College of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force 
state that to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension 
people should undergo out-of-office measurement 
(ambulatory or home blood pressure monitoring) if 
blood pressure is raised in the clinic.10 11 This method

WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Daytime ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is the recognised 
standard for measuring blood pressure and diagnosing hypertension
ABPM is currently recommended for all patients with raised screening clinic 
pressure, but triaging patients for this additional monitoring may be a more 
effective strategy
Blood pressure readings taken in research studies are not always comparable 
to those taken in clinical practice where there may be suboptimal measurement 
technique and rounding bias
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
The PRedicting Out-of-OFfice Blood Pressure (PROOF-BP) algorithm accurately

is cost effective as it reduces misdiagnosis caused by 
white coat hypertension.3 However, this approach is 
not perfect since in addition to detecting white coat 
hypertension, it results in other patients with true 
underlying hypertension identified by clinic blood 
pressure readings being sent for unnecessary out-of-
office monitoring. Additionally it will not capture those 
patients with masked hypertension and is not currently 
used routinely in treated patients with uncontrolled 
hypertension who might also be misclassified owing to 
white coat or masked effects.
Triaging patients for ABPM has been suggested 
to improve the management of hypertension by 
limiting the use of ABPM to those most likely to be 
misclassified by clinic blood pressure measurements.12 
The most effective way to triage patients for ABPM 
has been debated,13 14 but recent work proposes an 
individualised triaging approach using multiple 
clinic readings and patient characteristics (eFigures 2 
and 3).12 15
This approach, using the algorithm Predicting 
Out-of-OFfice Blood Pressure (PROOF-BP), has been 
validated12 and seems to be cost effective in a research 
setting,16 but blood pressure measurements taken 
under such controlled conditions are not necessarily 
comparable to blood pressure readings in routine 
clinical practice.17-19 Differences can occur due 
to suboptimal measurement techniques20-22 and 
rounding bias (rounding off readings to the nearest 
zero value).23 24 Thus, a triaging approach shown to be 
accurate in a research setting might not be as precise 
in routine clinical practice. We collected relevant data 
to prospectively validate this new triaging approach in 
routine clinical practice in both primary and secondary 
care.
Methods
The 
protocol 
for 
this 
prospective, 
multicentre 
observational cohort study has been published 
previously.25 The supplementary appendix provides 
detailed methods and the prespecified analysis plan.
Study participants and setting
Between May 2015 and January 2017 we enrolled 
consecutive patients attending participating centres 
in both primary and secondary care, for whom ABPM 
was considered appropriate. Eligible participants 
were those undergoing ABPM as a result of routine 
blood pressure screening or monitoring in primary 
care or through referral to secondary care with 
suspected hypertension, newly diagnosed or treated 
hypertension, 
resistant 
hypertension, 
secondary 
hypertension, or other conditions requiring specialist 
advice. Anonymised data were collected on all patients 
fulfilling the eligibility criteria. We excluded patients 
if they lacked basic clinical information, did not have 
multiple clinic blood pressure readings recorded 
(obtained on at least three occasions within the same 
visit), and did not wear the ambulatory blood pressure 
monitor as instructed.
Procedures
All participants underwent ABPM, clinic blood pressure 
measurement, and collection of patient characteristics. 
The protocol provides information on the data collected 
for each participant,25 which included blood pressure 
measurements (values and measurement technique), 
previous treatment prescriptions, body mass index, 
smoking status, and history of diabetes, chronic 
kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, and cardiovascular 
disease. Changes to antihypertensive treatment after 
ABPM were not recorded. All data were collected from 
electronic health records and trained staff at each data 
collection site entered data directly onto the study 
database.
To capture as close to routine blood pressure 
measurements as possible, staff at participating sites 
were asked to measure clinic and ambulatory blood 
pressure, but we did not suggest or recommend a 
specific protocol for measurement. We defined routine 
blood pressure as readings taken by the consulting 
healthcare professional as part of standard clinical 
practice.
For participants to be included in the study, we 
required a minimum of three clinic readings taken at 
the time of referral for ABPM or at fitting of the blood 
pressure monitor. Even though three measurements 
are recommended in guidelines,10 this may not always 
occur in routine practice.26 We specified three readings 
to be taken as mandatory to permit validation of the 
triaging algorithm. We offered each site a validated 
automated blood pressure monitoring device (Omron 
M10-IT; Omron, Kyoto, Japan) to assist with the 
collection of multiple clinic blood pressure readings, 
but with the option to continue with use of their 
own monitor, so long as at least three readings were 
taken and recorded. To our knowledge, all readings 
were taken with the doctor or nurse present. ABPM 
was conducted using the practice or hospital’s own 
ambulatory monitor and fitted by a trained nurse or 
allied health professional. Some practices in primary 
care only collected daytime ambulatory pressures. 
Supplementary eTable 1 gives details of clinic and 
ambulatory blood pressure monitors used at each site.
the PrOOF-bP triaging approach
The triaging strategy applied an algorithm to 
three blood pressure readings taken at the clinic 
appointment, combined with information from an 
individual’s electronic health record: age, sex, body 
mass index, hypertensive and treatment history, and 
the presence of cardiovascular disease (eFigures 2 
and 3).12 This algorithm identified three groups: those 
with definitively normal blood pressure, those with 
definitively high blood pressure, and those requiring 
further investigation using ABPM (see methods in 
online appendix for more detail).
Primary outcome
The primary outcome was the proportion of 
participants whose hypertensive status was correctly 
classified using the triaging strategy compared with

the reference standard of daytime ABPM (using a 
threshold for hypertension of ≥135/85 mm Hg).10 11 27 
This was defined as the proportion of patients with 
sustained hypertension (true positives), normotension 
(true negatives), white coat hypertension (false 
positives), and masked hypertension (false negatives).
Secondary outcomes
We estimated the sensitivity (for detecting hypertension 
in those with the condition), specificity (for ruling 
out hypertension in those without the condition), 
and positive and negative predictor values, and we 
compared these with guideline strategies for measuring 
blood pressure from the United Kingdom,10 United 
States,11 Europe,27 Canada,28 and Japan29 (eTable 2). 
Further secondary outcomes included accuracy of 
the triaging strategy in different subgroups: setting 
(primary care v secondary care), age (<65 years v ≥65 
years), sex, smoking status (never or former smoker 
v current smoker), body mass index (<30 kg/m2v ≥30 
kg/m2), and history of hypertension, diabetes, chronic 
kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease.
Data analysis
We used descriptive statistics to describe the number 
of patients classified with sustained hypertension, 
white coat hypertension, normotension, and masked 
hypertension with the triaging approach (the primary 
outcome) compared with daytime ABPM as the 
reference standard. These were used to calculate 
the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative 
predictor values of the triaging approach, and the total 
proportion of participants with correctly classified 
hypertensive status and proportion that would have 
been referred for ABPM.
To examine model performance, we constructed 
a logistic regression model with true hypertension 
(defined by daytime ABPM) as the dependant outcome 
variable and classification using the triaging approach 
as the independent predictor variable. From this model 
we estimated the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic (AUROC) curve statistic. Further analyses 
were conducted examining the primary outcomes 
using different definitions of clinic and ambulatory 
blood pressure (see online appendix).
Post hoc analyses
Post hoc analyses were undertaken to examine 
performance of the PROOF-BP algorithm on its own 
(without additional ABPM) and this was compared 
with other blood pressure measurement strategies 
(employed without ABPM).10 11 30-32 Subgroup analyses 
of the sensitivity and specificity of the PROOF-BP 
triaging approach were undertaken and accompanied 
by one additional non-prespecified subgroup: patients 
in whom the treating clinician’s own monitor was used 
to measure clinic blood pressure compared with those 
where monitors were provided by the research team.
All analyses were conducted using STATA version 
13.1 (MP parallel edition, StataCorp, TX). Results are 
presented as means or proportions, with standard 
deviations or 95% confidence intervals, unless stated 
otherwise.
Sample size
Based on the original validation of the PROOF-BP 
prediction model,12 accrual of data from at least 800 
patients was required for estimation of hypertensive 
status with an accuracy to within 2-6% (see eTable 
3).25 To ensure that the prespecified subgroup analysis 
could be adequately powered we specified a sample 
size of up to 1000 patients.
Patient and public involvement
Patients with a history of hypertension were 
approached to discuss the study at the design phase 
of the project. In particular their opinions were sought 
on the methods of recruitment and patient facing study 
literature, before ethical and NHS R&D applications.
Results
recruitment and baseline population
Ten general practice surgeries and one hospital trust 
participated in the study. A total of 897 patients 
attended participating sites for clinic blood pressure 
measurement and ABPM during the study period. 
In total, 10 patients (1.1%) were ineligible: eight 
had missing blood pressure readings, one was aged 
less than 18 years, and one had missing clinical 
information (fig 1). The remaining patients (n=887, 
99%) were enrolled into the study and included in the 
primary analysis.
Mean age was 52.8 (SD 16.2) years, 53.8% were 
women, and 14.0% were current smokers (table 1). 
Mean clinic blood pressure at referral for ABPM 
was 147/91 (SD 19/13) mm Hg. A small proportion 
had diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and a history 
of 
cardiovascular 
disease. 
Approximately 
70% 
had a history of hypertension and 61% of the total 
population were taking at least one antihypertensive

drug. Patients attending secondary care were younger 
and had higher blood pressure, more comorbidities, 
and were taking more antihypertensives than those 
attending primary care (table 1). Most patients were 
referred for ABPM owing to suspected hypertension or 
uncontrolled blood pressure (eTable 4).
Primary analysis
The triaging strategy (algorithm used in combination 
with ABPM) predicted true blood pressure (true 
positives 66%, 95% confidence interval 63% to 69%; 
true negatives 24%, 22% to 27%) with a low error rate 
(false positives 8%, 6% to 10%; false negatives 2%, 
1% to 3%) (table 2). The triaging strategy resulted 
in 49% (46% to 52%) being referred for ABPM and 
the remainder managed on the basis of their clinic 
measurements. Of the latter, 69 (8%, 6% to 10%) 
would have received treatment that would have been 
deemed unnecessary had they received an ABPM 
(table 2).

Secondary analysis
The triaging strategy had a sensitivity of 97% (95% 
confidence interval 96% to 98%) and specificity of 
76% (95% confidence interval 71% to 81%), and an 
AUROC of 0.86 (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.89) 
for predicting true hypertension (table 3). It would have 
resulted in higher sensitivity and negative predictive 
values but lower specificity and positive predictive 
values compared with other diagnostic strategies had 
they been applied to this population (including that 
recommended in the UK (eTables 5 and 6).
The sensitivity of the triaging strategy was 
consistently high (95-100%) regardless of the setting, 
underlying prevalence of hypertension, subgroup 
population, or clinic blood pressure monitor used 
(table 3, fig 2). Specificity was affected by the 
population, with values as low as 60% in patients 
with chronic kidney disease and as high as 85% in

patients with no previous diagnosis of hypertension 
(fig 2). Hypertensive status was correctly classified 
in 87-91% of patients, regardless of the setting, 
patient characteristics, comorbidities, or history of 
hypertension or treatment (fig 3). However, a lower 
prevalence of hypertension with more individuals with 
intermediate blood pressures resulted in more referrals 
for ABPM in a primary care setting (59% v 42% 
secondary care) and in those patients with no history 
of hypertension (62% v 44% history of hypertension) 
or prescription for antihypertensives (56% v 44% 
existing prescription) (fig 4).
The triaging approach performed consistently well 
in terms of hypertensive classification and lower 
utilisation of ABPM, regardless of the number of 
clinic blood pressure readings or period of 24 hours 
used to define ambulatory blood pressure (eTable 
7). The approach did result in fewer patients being

correctly classified according to night time blood 
pressure (90.3% primary analysis v. 87.5% night 
time readings), reflecting the different diagnostic 
thresholds used to define night time hypertension. The 
performance of the PROOF-BP algorithm was reduced 
when utilised without ABPM—that is, not as a triaging 
tool (eTable 8).
discussion
This study aimed to prospectively validate a new 
approach to determine who should be offered 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) for 
suspected or poor control of hypertension in real world 
settings. In a population being referred for ABPM, use 
of a triaging strategy captured nearly all patients with 
hypertension while resulting in half the number of 
referrals for resource intensive ABPM compared with 
usual care. However, such a strategy would misclassify 
as hypertensive, one in four of those without 
hypertension, potentially leading to unnecessary 
treatment. Used in a diagnostic situation in people 
without a previous diagnosis of hypertension, this 
misclassification of normotensive people was reduced 
to one in seven. These findings suggest the potential 
for diagnosing and managing hypertension using a 
triaging strategy to reduce the need for ABPM.
Strengths and weaknesses of this study
This study was conducted according to a prepublished, 
peer reviewed protocol, with analyses undertaken 
in line with a prespecified analysis plan. The study 
included 98.8% of patients attending routine practice 
during the study period, suggesting it is likely to be 
representative of the target population (those who have 
an indication for ABPM) and was sufficiently powered 
to examine key outcomes.
Unlike the previous studies in which the PROOF-BP 
triaging algorithm has been previously validated,12 
30-33 the measurement of clinic blood pressure was 
not standardised in terms of requiring healthcare 
professionals to use certain monitors or to conform to 
a specific measurement protocol. This was deliberate 
in an attempt to replicate readings taken in routine 
clinical practice where techniques for blood pressure 
measurement can vary.34 It is recognised that such 
readings may not truly reflect routine practice 
either, since healthcare professionals knew they 
were participating in a research study and validated 
monitors were provided to some sites to aid the capture 
of three consecutive clinic readings.32 In total, six of the 
11 participating sites used the validated clinic blood 
pressure monitors supplied by the research team, but 
this had no impact on the performance of the triaging 
approach.
The study included patients in whom the treating 
doctor felt ABPM was appropriate. In most cases this 
was owing to suspected hypertension or apparently 
uncontrolled blood pressure (eTable 4). This included 
patients with no history of hypertension (ie, those 
referred for diagnosis) and those already prescribed 
blood pressure lowering drugs (ie, those referred 
for management of hypertension). The findings are 
therefore widely applicable to patients undergoing 
diagnosis and also applicable to those in whom 
the consulting doctor is considering treatment 
intensification but is unsure if this is appropriate. 
Although additional monitoring is not recommended 
in those with normal blood pressure,10 11 27 22% of 
the present cohort had clinic readings below 140/90 
mm Hg before ABPM and 9% proved to have masked 
hypertension, which is consistent with previous 
prevalence estimates.35-37
comparison with other literature
Few studies have previously identified an effective 
method for triaging patients for out-of-office blood 
pressure monitoring, and none have externally 
validated such a method using data from a routine 
clinical setting. The original PROOF-BP derivation 
paper reported good performance of the algorithm 
when used in combination with ABPM, with a 
sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 87%. One study 
examined the optimal threshold for referral for out-
of-office monitoring based on automated clinic blood 
pressure levels in patients with normal clinic pressure 
for detection of masked hypertension.13 The authors 
reported a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 58% for 
a clinic blood pressure threshold of 120 mm Hg systolic. 
In practice, such a threshold would have limited 
accuracy and efficiency, missing one in four patients 
with hypertension and resulting in a large number of 
patients being referred for ABPM. As such, they did not 
recommend this approach for use in routine clinical 
practice. The PROOF-BP triaging strategy examined 
here uses an individualised approach, taking into 
account a patient’s clinic blood pressure level and 
variability and underlying cardiovascular risk. It is an 
approach that maximises the accuracy of hypertensive 
classification while minimising ABPM use compared 
with usual care, which uses fixed thresholds for 
referral in all patients.
implications for clinical practice
Use of a triaging approach would substantially reduce 
the proportion of people requiring ABPM at the expense 
of “over treating” a small proportion of individuals. 
The triaging algorithm performed consistently across 
sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses. Because 
the triaging mechanism is based on thresholds of 
adjusted clinic blood pressure, scenarios where a 
greater number of individuals have blood pressures 
close to the diagnostic threshold for hypertension are 
likely to result in greater numbers of patients being 
referred for ABPM. The greater the use of ABPM, the 
more accurate the triaging strategy was (in patients 
with no history of hypertension the sensitivity was 95% 
and specificity 85%, but 61% were referred for ABPM). 
Where ABPM facilities are widely available, clinicians 
may therefore want to consider additional use of 
ABPM, where the risk of misdiagnosis is great but an 
individual is not within the triaging range. This could 
include younger, lower risk people for whom a lifetime

of treatment may have a larger impact on their quality 
of life. However, in low and middle income countries 
where resources might be more stretched, the PROOF-
BP triaging approach represents an alternative option 
that maximises the benefits of ABPM and targets those 
with the most to gain.
These data suggest that the PROOF-BP triaging 
strategy may be used in both primary and secondary 
care wherever ABPM is being considered to rule out 
white coat hypertension. To facilitate uptake, the 
algorithm is freely available as a calculator online 
(https://sentry.phc.ox.ac.uk/proof-bp) and could be 
incorporated into clinic computer systems, smartphone 
blood pressure management apps, and Bluetooth 
enabled monitors, providing general practitioners 
and hospital doctors with instant feedback and 
management recommendations in terms of referral or 
treatment.
conclusions
This prospective, external validation study shows 
the accuracy of the PROOF-BP algorithm as a tool 
for triaging patients for ABPM in routine clinical 
practice. Used in conjunction with ABPM, the 
algorithm identifies most patients with hypertension 
and results in half as many patients being referred for 
additional ABPM compared with usual care. It may, 
however, lead to a small number of patients receiving 
unnecessary treatment. Such an approach can now be 
recommended for use in both primary and secondary 
care, wherever ABPM is being considered to rule out 
white coat hypertension or masked hypertension.
