IMPORTANCE The pathogenesis of rosacea is unclear, but increased matrix metalloproteinase
target tissue activity appears to play an important role. Parkinson disease and other
neurodegenerative disorders also display increased matrix metalloproteinase activity that
contribute to neuronal loss.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the risk of incident (new-onset) Parkinson disease in patients with
rosacea.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A nationwide cohort study of the Danish population
was conducted using individual-level linkage of administrative registers. All Danish citizens
18 years or older from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2011 (N = 5 472 745), were included.
Data analysis was conducted from June 26 to July 27, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was a diagnosis of Parkinson disease.
Incidence rates (IRs) per 10 000 person-years were calculated, and incidence rate ratios
(IRRs) adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, smoking, alcohol abuse, medication, and
comorbidity were estimated by Poisson regression models.
RESULTS A total of 5 404 692 individuals were included in the reference population; of these,
22 387 individuals (9812 [43.8%] women; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 75.9 [10.2] years)
received a diagnosis of Parkinson disease during the study period and 68 053 individuals
(45 712 [67.2%] women; mean age, 42.2 [16.5] years) were registered as having rosacea.
The IRs of Parkinson disease per 10 000 person-years were 3.54 (95% CI, 3.49-3.59) in the
reference population and 7.62 (95% CI, 6.78-8.57) in patients with rosacea. The adjusted IRR
of Parkinson disease was 1.71 (95%, CI 1.52-1.92) in patients with rosacea compared with the
reference population. There was a 2-fold increased risk of Parkinson disease in patients
classified as having ocular rosacea (adjusted IRR, 2.03 [95% CI, 1.67-2.48]), and tetracycline
therapy appeared to reduce the risk of Parkinson disease (adjusted IRR, 0.98 [95% CI,
0.97-0.99]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Rosacea constitutes an independent risk factor for Parkinson
disease. This association could be due to shared pathogenic mechanisms involving elevated
matrix metalloproteinase activity. The clinical consequences of this association require
further study.

R
osacea is a common chronic inflammatory skin condi-
tion characterized primarily by transient or persistent
centrofacial erythema as well as concomitant telangi-
ectasia, papules, and pustules. However, distinct clinical pat-
ternsexistandtheNationalRosaceaSocietyExpertCommittee1
recognizes 4 subtypes of rosacea that frequently overlap:
(1) erythematotelangiectatic, (2) inflammatory papulopustu-
lar, (3) phymatous, and (4) ocular. Topical anti-inflammatory
antibiotics, azelaic acid, or retinoids constitute the usual first-
line therapies, and systemic drugs with anti-inflammatory ef-
fects, such as tetracyclines and isotretinoins, are used for mod-
erate to severe rosacea.1,2
Although the etiopathogenesis of rosacea is not fully
understood, the condition has a genetic component.3 More-
over, distinct environmental triggers, including Demodex
folliculorum, UV irradiation, temperature changes, and alco-
hol consumption, have been identified.1 Rosacea skin shows
an upregulation of various cytokines, in particular, antimicro-
bial peptides, and displays increased activation and expres-
sion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).1,2 There is a criti-
cal interplay between MMPs and antimicrobial peptides in
rosacea skin; for example, MMP-9 activates the kallikrein 5 ser-
ine protease, leading to generation of LL-37 (the cathelicidin-
derived antimicrobial peptide), which may then further stimu-
late inflammation.1
Matrix metalloproteinases have also been implicated4-6 in
the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease and other neurodegen-
erative disorders; in experimental models of Parkinson dis-
ease, MMP-3 and MMP-9 levels are increased and contribute
to dopaminergic neuronal loss. A German study7 of 70 pa-
tients with Parkinson disease showed that rosacea was present
in18.6%oftheparticipantsandthat31.4%reportedfacialflush-
ing associated with temperature changes. In view of these data
linking rosacea and Parkinson disease, we evaluated a pos-
sible association between the 2 conditions in a nationwide
cohort of the Danish population between January 1, 1997, and
December 31, 2011.
Methods
Data Sources and Study Population
Study approval was obtained from the Danish Data Protec-
tion Agency. Review by an ethics committee is not required for
registry studies in Denmark. Conduct of this study was in ac-
cordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observa-
tional Studies in Epidemiology recommendations.8
In brief, the Danish Civil Registration System assigns a per-
manent and unique 10-digit personal identification number to
allcitizensatbirthorimmigration,whichallowsforunambigu-
ous linkage across nationwide registries.9 Moreover, the Dan-
ish Civil Registration System contains information such as date
of birth, sex, and vital status, and Statistics Denmark records
information on tax-reported household income.10 The Danish
National Patient Registery11 contains information on all inpa-
tient and outpatient (ambulatory) hospital contacts since 1978
according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)
(prior to 1994 according to the 8th revision [ICD-8] and there-
after according to the International Statistical Classification of
DiseasesandRelatedHealthProblems,TenthRevision[ICD-10]),
and hospital treatment interventions, surgical procedures, and
hospital-administered pharmacotherapy are coded as treat-
ment procedure codes. All pharmacy-dispensed prescriptions
in Denmark have been accurately recorded in the Register of
Medicinal Product Statistics since 1994, and all drugs are clas-
sifiedaccordingtotheAnatomicalTherapeuticChemical(ATC)
classification.12
All Danish citizens 18 years or older were included in the
cohort on January 1, 1997, or the subsequent day that they be-
came that age. Individuals were followed up until December
31, 2011; migration; a diagnosis of Parkinson disease; or death
fromanycause,whichevercamefirst.Atbaseline,patientswith
prevalent rosacea or Parkinson disease and those with a his-
tory of anti-Parkinson dopaminergic drug use were excluded
to enable accurate examination of the temporal association be-
tween exposure to rosacea and the subsequent risk of Parkin-
son disease. Patients with rosacea were identified by the first
documentation of either a hospital (inpatient or outpatient) di-
agnosis of rosacea (ICD-8 code 695.3 and ICD-10 code L71) or
when they obtained their second prescription of topical met-
ronidazole (ATC D06BX01), which is the preferred first-line
treatment for rosacea and is used infrequently for other skin
conditions in Denmark.
End Points
The primary end point of the study was a hospital diagnosis
of idiopathic Parkinson disease (ICD-10 code G20). This diag-
nosis has previously been validated with an accuracy of 82.4%
in the Danish National Patient Register based on the criteria
of the UK Parkinson Disease Society Brain Bank13,14 and the cri-
teria of Gelb et al.15 Moreover, we investigated the initiation
of treatment with anti-Parkinson dopaminergic agents (ATC
codeN04B)asasecondaryendpoint.Inapreviouspopulation-
based study16 of Danish patients with Parkinson disease, 91%
of the patients received these drugs, and this treatment was
initiated by general practitioners in 75% of the cases on aver-
age 3 years before the patients experienced their first hospi-
tal contact for Parkinson disease.
Covariates
Stroke (ICD-8 codes 432-436 and ICD-10 codes I63-I64) was in-
cludedasacovariateintheanalyses,aswasuseofantimigraine
Key Points
Question Do patients with rosacea have an increased risk of
Parkinson disease?
Findings This population-based cohort study found a significantly
increased risk of Parkinson disease in patients with rosacea
compared with the general population. Notably, treatment with
tetracycline was associated with a reduced risk of Parkinson
disease.
Meaning Rosacea is an independent risk factor for Parkinson
disease; focus on neurologic symptoms in patients with rosacea
may be warranted.

agents (ATC code N02C), antidepressants (ATC code N06A),
and anxiolytics (ATC code N05).17-19 We tracked smoking his-
torythroughanalgorithmpreviouslydescribed.20Patientswith
a history of alcohol abuse were identified through the use of
pharmacotherapy, treatment interventions, or diagnoses
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). We calculated an index of so-
cioeconomic status between 0 and 4, with 4 indicating the
highest income group, based on the mean gross annual in-
come (standardized by age) during a 5-year period before study
inclusion. Baseline medication use was calculated up to 6
months and information on comorbidity, smoking history, and
alcohol abuse was collected up to 5 years before the study. In-
formation on covariates was continuously updated through-
out the study period.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics are presented as frequencies with per-
centages for categorical variables and means (SDs) for con-
tinuousvariables.Incidenceratesweresummarizedper10 000
person-years at risk. Outcomes before an index date in the ro-
sacea group were allocated to the reference group to obtain a
more accurate exposure-time allocation. For risk estimation,
Poisson regression models were used to calculate crude-, age-,
and sex-adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs), as well as IRRs
adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, smoking, alco-
hol abuse, medication, and comorbidity.
For sensitivity analyses, we retrieved information on pre-
scriptions for tetracycline (ATC code J01A), which is the most
commonly used oral prescription medication for rosacea in
Denmark, to obtain a reasonably valid estimate of rosacea se-
verity. Thus, patients were classified as having mild disease
from the onset of rosacea until they fulfilled the criteria for
moderate to severe rosacea (ie, initiation of oral tetracycline
therapy, if appropriate). In these analyses, patients were in-
cluded in the mild rosacea group until they fulfilled the crite-
riaformoderatetosevererosacea,ifappropriate.Patientswere
classified as having ocular rosacea if they had obtained a pre-
scription for hypromellose eyedrops (ATC code S01XA20),
which is often used to treat xerophthalmia in rosacea, and we
identified patients with rhinophyma by the ICD-10 code L71.1.
Because Parkinson disease is associated with seborrheic
dermatitis,wealsoperformedsensitivityanalysesinwhichpa-
tients with rosacea were excluded if they had ever (ie, before,
during, or after inclusion) received treatment with ketocon-
azoleinashampooortopicalformulation(ATCcodeD01AC08)
or topical corticosteroids (ATC code D07A), which are the
typical treatment modalities for seborrheic dermatitis in
Denmark.21 Moreover, we repeated our primary analyses using
a hospital dermatologist (inpatient or outpatient) diagnosis of
rosacea (ICD-10 code L71) as our exposure variable. Finally, to
assess whether tetracycline therapy was associated with a re-
ducedriskofParkinsondisease,weperformedanalysesoffilled
prescriptions for tetracycline regardless of the presence or ab-
sence of rosacea. Statistical significance was set at P < .05, and
the results are reported as 95% CIs where applicable. All sta-
tisticalanalyseswereperformedwithStata,version11.0(Stata-
Corp) and SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc). Data analysis
was conducted from June 26 to July 27, 2015.
Results
From January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2011, the study popu-
lation comprised 5 536 422 Danish citizens 18 years or older.
After excluding 7803 and 15 920 individuals with rosacea or
Parkinson disease, 32 individuals with both rosacea and Par-
kinson disease, and 39 922 individuals with incomplete mi-
gration information, the final cohort included 5 472 745 indi-
viduals, with a maximum follow-up of 15 years. The study
flowchart is shown in the Figure, and the baseline character-
istics of the study population are reported in Table 1.
Risk of Parkinson Disease in Patients With Rosacea
During the study period, a total of 22 107 and 280 cases of Par-
kinsondiseaseoccurredamongthereferencepopulationandthe
rosaceacohort,respectively(Table2).Ofthe22 387individuals
who received a diagnosis of Parkinson disease during the study
period,9812(43.8%)werewomen,andthemeanageatdiagno-
sis was 75.9 [10.2] years. A total of 93 411 individuals in the ref-
erence population and 1169 of those in the rosacea group initi-
atedtreatmentwithanti-Parkinsondopaminergicagentsinthe
2 groups. The incidence rates of Parkinson disease per 10 000
person-yearswere3.54(95%CI,3.49-3.59)and7.62(95%CI,6.78-
8.57) in the reference population and in patients with rosacea,
respectively, and the incidence rates of treatment with anti-
Parkinsondopaminergicagentswere15.03(95%CI,14.93-15.12)
and32.17(95%CI,30.38-34.07),respectively.Parkinsondisease
occurred approximately 2.4 years earlier in patients with rosa-
cea (mean [SD] age, 73.7 [10.3] years) compared with the refer-
ence population (76.1 [10.2] years) (P < .001 for the difference).
The crude IRR of Parkinson disease was 2.15 (95% CI, 1.91-
2.42) in patients with rosacea compared with the reference
population, whereas the fully adjusted (age, sex, socioeco-
nomic status, smoking, alcohol abuse, comorbidity, and medi-
cation) IRR was 1.71 (95% CI, 1.52-1.92), as detailed in Table 3.

Stratification by sex yielded similar results in fully adjusted
analysesforwomen(IRR,1.74;95%CI,1.46-2.07)andmen(IRR,
1.62;95%CI,1.38-1.91).TheadjustedIRRoftreatmentwithanti-
Parkinson dopaminergic agents was 1.59 (95% CI, 1.50-1.69)
in patients with rosacea compared with the reference popu-
lation and remained significant in estimates stratified for sex.
Sensitivity Analyses
In sensitivity analyses, stratification by the presumed severity
of rosacea based on pharmacotherapy revealed a significantly
increased risk of Parkinson disease in patients with mild rosa-
cea (fully adjusted IRR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.57-2.11) and moderate to
severerosacea(fullyadjustedIRR,1.84;95%CI,1.51-2.24)—adis-
easeseveritydosedependencywasnotapparent.Moreover,the
fullyadjustedIRRsrevealedanincreasedriskoftreatmentwith
anti-Parkinson dopaminergic agents in mild (IRR, 1.66; 95% CI
1.53-1.79) and moderate to severe (IRR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.56-1.88)
rosacea, and the results remained similar after stratification for
sex(eTable2intheSupplement).ThefullyadjustedIRRsofPar-
kinson disease were 1.57 (95% CI, 1.36-1.82) and 2.03 (95% CI,
1.67-2.48) for patients with rosacea who never picked up a pre-
scriptionforhypromelloseeyedropsandpatientswithpresumed
ocular rosacea, respectively. Among patients with rhinophyma
(n = 751),therewere4casesofParkinsondisease,and14patients
initiated treatment with anti-Parkinson dopaminergic agents.
ThefullyadjustedIRRsforParkinsondiseaseandtreatmentwith
anti-Parkinson dopaminergic agents were 1.43 (95% CI, 0.54-
3.83;P = .50)and2.05(95%CI,1.21-3.45;P = .007),respectively,
inpatientswithrhinophyma.Inanalysesoftetracyclineuse(re-
gardless of a rosacea diagnosis), filled prescriptions of tetracy-
clines were associated with a 2% decrease in the risk of Parkin-
son disease (adjusted IRR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99; P < .001).
When we excluded all patients with rosacea who had ever
filled a prescription for ketoconazole (shampoo or topical for-
mulation) or topical corticosteroids, the fully adjusted IRR of
both Parkinson disease (fully adjusted IRR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.36-
2.31), and treatment with anti-Parkinson dopaminergic agents
(fully adjusted IRR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.13-1.50) remained signifi-
cant. In sensitivity analyses, in which the exposure was a hos-
pital diagnosis of rosacea, the fully adjusted IRR of Parkinson
disease was 2.11 (95% CI, 1.44-3.10). Similarly, when the end
point was initiation of treatment with anti-Parkinson dopa-
minergic agents, the patients with a hospital diagnosis of ro-
sacea had a fully adjusted IRR of 1.58 (95% CI, 1.29-1.92).
Discussion
In this nationwide study of the Danish population followed up
to 15 years, we observed a significantly increased risk of new-
onset Parkinson disease in patients with rosacea and a younger
age at Parkinson disease onset in these individuals. The re-
sults remained consistent in fully adjusted models and in sen-
sitivity analyses. Analyses aimed at evaluating the risk of Par-
kinson disease in rosacea subtypes showed a tendency toward
an increased risk in patients with ocular rosacea. In addition,
regardless of the presence of rosacea, a decreased risk of Par-
kinson disease was found in individuals who had filled pre-
scriptions for tetracyclines.
FewriskfactorsforParkinsondiseasehavebeenidentified;
theseincludeage,malesex,ethnicity,andcertainenvironmen-
talfactors(eg,pesticideexposureandpriorheadinjury[increased
risk]andtobaccosmoking,coffeedrinking,andalcoholconsump-
tion[decreasedrisk]).22Neuroinflammationisanestablishedfea-
ture of Parkinson disease, and increased expression of MMP-3
and MMP-9 has been implicated4,5,23 in the loss of dopaminer-
gic neurons and nigrostriatal pathway degeneration in mouse
modelsofParkinsondiseaseinwhichgeneticdeletionofMMP-3
and MMP-9 confers significant protection. Furthermore, in an
invivostudy,6apolymorphismintheMMP-9gene,whichleads
to higher promoter activity, was associated with a significantly
increasedriskofneurodegenerativedisorders,includingParkin-
son disease. Patients with rosacea also have increased activity
of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9 in affected skin regions, which
leads to inflammatory tissue damage and extracellular matrix
degradation.24 Increased tear fluid MMP activity has also been
found in patients with ocular rosacea,25 and the recognition of
neurogenic rosacea, a rosacea subtype that includes symptoms
such as burning and stinging cutaneous pain, facial flushing,
migraine, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and even tremor, lends

However,weemphasizethatthesefindingsarehypothesisgen-

in Denmark. Misclassification was a risk in the ocular rosacea
group because viscous eyedrops are used for many conditions.
We attempted to rule out misclassification of rosacea and seb-
orrheicdermatitisbyexcludingallpatientswhoeverreceivedcor-
ticosteroidsorketoconazoletherapy.Notably,thesebumexcre-
tionrateisnotincreasedinpatientswithrosacea,therebynearly

our study does not allow establishment of causation, and we
cannotruleoutthepossibilityofresidualconfoundingowingto

sacea. Finally, the Danish population is primarily of Northern
European descent, which may limit extrapolation to other
ethnicities.
Conclusions
Weobservedasignificantlyincreasedriskofnew-onsetParkin-
sondiseaseinpatientswithrosacea.Furtherstudiesareneeded
to confirm this observation and its clinical consequences.
