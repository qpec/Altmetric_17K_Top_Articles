Summary
Inflammation is paramount in pancreatic oncogenesis. We identified a uniquely-activated γδT cell 
population which constituted ∼40% of tumor-infiltrating T cells in human pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDA). Recruitment and activation of γδT cells was contingent on diverse 
chemokine signals. Deletion, depletion, or blockade of γδT cell recruitment was protective against 
PDA and resulted in increased infiltration, activation, and Th1-polarization of αβT cells. Whereas 
αβT cells were dispensable to outcome in PDA, they became indispensable mediators of tumor-

Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a devastating disease in which the mortality rate 
approaches the incidence rate (Yadav and Lowenfels, 2013). PDA is almost invariably 
associated with a robust inflammatory cell infiltrate which has considerable influence on 
disease progression (Andren-Sandberg et al., 1997; Clark et al., 2007). Peri-pancreatic 
leukocytic subsets can have divergent effects on tumorigenesis by either combating cancer 
growth via antigen-restricted tumoricidal immune responses or by promoting tumor 
progression via induction of immune suppression (Zheng et al., 2013). For example, CD8+ T 
cells and Th1-polarized CD4+ T cells mediate tumor-protection in murine models of PDA 
and are associated with prolonged survival in human disease (De Monte et al., 2011; 
Fukunaga et al., 2004). Similarly, we found that negating cytotoxic CD8+ anti-tumor

 responses by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) markedly accelerates PDA growth 
(Pylayeva-Gupta et al., 2012). Conversely, we recently reported that antigen-restricted Th2-
deviated CD4+ T cells strongly promote PDA progression in mice (Ochi et al., 2012b). 
Accordingly, intra-tumoral CD4+ Th2 cell infiltrates correlate with reduced survival in 
human PDA (De Monte et al., 2011; Fukunaga et al., 2004).
γδT cells are a non-MHC-restricted lymphocyte subset closely aligned with innate 
immunity. In vitro activated PBMC-derived γδT cells have cytolytic efficacy against PDA 
(Oberg et al., 2014). Conversely, a recent study showed that γδT cells produce high levels of 
tumor-promoting IL-17 in PDA (McAllister et al., 2014). Nevertheless, intra-pancreatic γδT 
cells have not been well characterized. We found that a novel population of γδT cells with a 
uniquely activated phenotype infiltrates the pre-neoplastic pancreas and invasive PDA in 
mice. In human PDA, γδT cells are a dominant T cell population comprising up to 75% of 
all T lymphocytes. Deletion of intra-pancreatic γδT cells markedly protects against 
oncogenesis in vivo and results in an influx of immunogenic Th1 cells and CD8+ T cells to 
the TME. Based on these observations, we postulated that pancreas-infiltrating γδT cells 
promote PDA progression by inducing adaptive immune suppression. We discovered novel 
γδT cells cross-talk with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells implicating γδT cells as primary 
regulators of αβT cell activation in PDA.
Results
Activated γδ
γδT cells are ubiquitous in human PDA
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that γδT cells are widely distributed within the 
human PDA tumor stroma but absent in normal pancreas (Figure 1a). Moreover, up to 75% 
of human PDA-infiltrating T cells were TCRγ/δ+ compared with a much lower fraction in 
PBMC (Figure 1b). On average, γδT cells had a similar prevalence to select myeloid-
derived cellular subsets within the PDA TME (Figure 1c) and comprised a significantly 
higher percentage of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes compared with CD8+ T cells (Figure 
1d). Human T cell subsets, including γδT cells, can be broadly classified as central memory 
(TCM) or effector memory (TEM) based on their co-expression of CD45RA and CD27 
(Sallusto et al., 2004). We found γδT cells in PBMC were predominantly TCM whereas 
PDA-infiltrating γδT cells were mostly TEM cells, indicative of a distinctly activated 
phenotype (Figure 1e). Accordingly, tumor-infiltrating γδT cells down-regulated CD62L 
compared with their counterparts in PBMC (Figure 1f). However, Vγ9+ γδT cells – 
associated with tumoricidal function (Izumi et al., 2013; Kunzmann et al., 2012) – were 
notably absent in PDA, suggestive of tumor-permissive properties (Figure 1g).

In vivo imaging of pancreata from C57BL/6-Trdctm1Mal mice harboring orthotopically 
implanted Pdx1Cre;KrasG12D;Tp53R172H (KPC)-derived invasive PDA suggested that γδT 
cells were highly prevalent in the interstitial space of murine PDA (Figure 2a). Flow 
cytometry suggested a higher frequency of γδT cells infiltrating orthotopic KPC tumors 
compared with the spleen of tumor-bearing mice (Figure 2b). Similar to human disease, the

 population of PDA-infiltrating γδT cells in mice were distinctly activated expressing higher 
FasL, NK1.1, CD39, CD44, JAML, and OX40 compared with spleen γδT cells (Figure 2c). 
Further, in contrast to spleen, PDA-infiltrating γδT cells contained a prominent Vγ4+ subset 
whereas Vγ1+ cells were rare (Figure 2c). Tumor-infiltrating γδT cells also expressed 
elevated levels of IL-10 and IL-17 (Figure 2d, e). Similarly, Th1- (TNFα, IFNγ), and 
additional Th2- (IL-13) cytokines were highly expressed in PDA-infiltrating γδT cells (not 
shown). Moreover, PDA-infiltrating γδT cells exhibited a substantial FoxP3+ fraction which 
has been associated with immune suppressive function (Kang et al., 2009), compared with 
absent expression of FoxP3+ in spleen γδT cells (Figure S1a). Conversely, T-bet was equally 
expressed in γδT cells in both compartments (Figure S1b). Further, PDA-infiltrating γδT 
cells expressed high levels of the NKG2D receptor (Figure 2f) as well as elevated TLR4, 
TLR7 and TLR9 (Figure 2g) which are potential avenues for cellular activation in PDA 
(Zambirinis et al., 2015). CCR2, CCR5, and CCR6 were also upregulated in PDA-
infiltrating γδT cells (Figure 2h).
To determine whether γδT cells were similarly prominent in a slowly progressive model of 
PDA, we interrogated pancreata of 6 month-old p48Cre;KrasG12D (KC) mice harboring 
preinvasive tumor. γδT cells represented ∼6–8% of CD3+ T cells in the pancreas of KC 
mice compared with ∼2% in the spleen and tumor-draining lymph nodes (Figure S2a). 
Further, similar to mice with invasive PDA, γδT cells expressed high levels of chemokine 
receptors (Figure S2b), TLRs (Figure S2c), and activation markers, and included a 
prominent Vγ4+ fraction (Figure S2d).
γδ
γδT cell recruitment and activation in PDA is contingent on diverse chemokine signaling
Since we found that PDA-infiltrating γδT cells express high CCR2, CCR5, and CCR6, we 
postulated that ligation of these receptors is critical in their recruitment to the TME. To test 
this, we challenged CCR2−/−, CCL2−/−, CCR5−/−, and CCR6−/− mice with orthotopic KPC-
derived tumor and measured γδT cell infiltration on day 21. Deletion of CCR2, CCL2, or 
CCR6 significantly reduced γδT cell infiltration to the TME (Figure S3a). Moreover, 
selective CCR2, CCR5, CCR6 or CCL2 deletion mitigated TNF-α and IL-13 expression 
from PDA-infiltrating γδT cells whereas γδT cell expression of IL-17 and IFN-γ were not 
affected (Figure S3b–e). γδT cell expression of FoxP3 or IL-10 were similarly not perturbed 
by blockade of chemokine signaling (not shown).
γδ
γδT cells promote pancreatic oncogenesis
Since γδT cells are a prominent lymphocytic subset within the pancreatic TME, we 
postulated that they play a critical role in oncogenesis. To test this, we crossed KC mice with 
Tcrδ−/− mice. Pancreata of KC;Tcrδ−/− mice were protected from progressive oncogenesis 
exhibiting a diminished rate of acinar replacement by dysplastic ducts and substantially 
slower PanIN progression at multiple time-points (Figure 3a). Analysis of pancreas weights 
confirmed the protective effects of γδT cell deletion (Figure 3b). γδT cell ablation was also 
associated with reduced peri-tumoral fibrosis (Figure 3c). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis 
revealed a nearly 1 year increase in the median survival of γδT cell-deficient KC mice 
compared with controls (Figure 3d).

 Since genetic deletion of γδT cells has limited translational applicability to human disease, 
we tested whether in vivo depletion of Vγ4+ γδT cells using a neutralizing mAb would 
offer similar protection (Figure S3f). We treated 6 week-old KC mice for 8 weeks with 
UC3-10A6 or isotype control and assessed their effects on tumorigenesis. γδT cell depletion 
protected against oncogenic progression based on histological analysis of ductal 
transformation (Figure 3e) and tumor mass (Figure 3f). To determine whether the presence 
of γδT cells are similarly associated with accelerated tumorigenesis in an invasive model of 
PDA, we orthotopically implanted KPC-derived tumor cells into the pancreatic body of WT 
and Tcrδ−/− mice. Consistent with our data in KC mice, deletion of γδT cells impressively 
protected against tumor growth and extended survival in the orthotopic KPC model (Figure 
S3g, h). γδT cell depletion similarly extended survival in invasive PDA (Figure S3g). 
Moreover, blocking γδT cell recruitment and activation using mice deficient in selective 
chemokine signaling was also protective (Figure S3i). Notably, disease phenotype in 
caerulein-induced pancreatitis was not mitigated in Tcrδ−/− mice suggesting that the ability 
of γδT cells to modulate pancreatic disease is specific to PDA (Figure S4a–g).
PDA-infiltrating γδ
γδT cells do not have direct pro-tumorigenic effects on epithelial cells
We hypothesized that γδT cells may have direct oncogenic effects on transformed epithelial 
cells. To test this, we co-cultured tumor cells derived from KPC mice with FACS-sorted 
PDA-infiltrating γδT cells. However, γδT cells failed to enhance proliferation (Figure S4h) 
or deregulate expression of oncogenic or tumor suppressor genes (Figure S4i) in transformed 
epithelial cells. Similarly, γδT cell co-culture did not elicit pro-inflammatory or regulatory 
cytokine production from tumor cells suggesting that PDA-infiltrating γδT cells do not 
promote tumorigenesis via direct engagement of cancer cells (Figure S4j).
γδ
γδT cells support an immune suppressive pancreas tumor microenvironment in invasive 
and preinvasive PDA
We postulated that intra-pancreatic γδT cells may promote tumorigenesis by engendering an 
immune-suppressive pancreatic TME. We found that whereas CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were 
scarce in invasive PDA tumors, tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased ∼10-
fold in absence of γδT cells (Figure 4a, b). Moreover, besides expanding in number, PDA-
infiltrating αβT cells were markedly activated in Tcrδ−/− hosts. CD8+ T cells infiltrating 
γδT cell-deficient tumors expressed higher CD44 (Figure 4c), ICOS (Figure 4d), CTLA4 
(Figure 4e), and Granzyme B (Figure 4f), each indicative of higher cytotoxic T cell 
activation. Similarly, CD4+ T cells infiltrating γδT cell-deficient tumors expressed higher 
CD44 (Figure 4g), OX40 (Figure 4h), and PD-1 (Figure 4i), and lower CD62L (Figure 4j). 
Further, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressed elevated TNF-α and IFN-γ in γδT cell-
deleted tumors, indicative of enhanced Th1-differentation and higher CD8+ T cell 
cytotoxicity (Figure 5a). Accordingly, PDA-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells each sharply 
upregulated T-bet expression in the context of γδT cell deletion (Figure 5b). GATA-3 and 
FoxP3 expression in CD4+ T cells were not affected by γδT cell deletion (Figure 5c, d). 
Collectively, these data suggest immunogenic reprogramming of adaptive αβT lymphocytes 
in PDA in the absence of γδT cells.

 To determine whether γδT cells similarly delimit αβT cell expansion and activation in a 
slowly progressive model of PDA, we compared CD4+ and CD8+ T cell phenotype in 
KC;Tcrδ+/+ versus KC;Tcrδ−/− pancreata. We found that while CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were 
scarce in KC;Tcrδ+/+ controls, both lymphocyte populations were markedly expanded in 
KC;Tcrδ pancreata (Figure S5a, b). Further, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in PDA-draining 
lymph nodes expressed higher CD44 (Figure S5c) and PD-1 (Figure S5d) in KC;Tcrδ−/− 
animals compared with KC;Tcrδ+/+. Similarly, ICOS and Granzyme B expression were 
increased in CD8+ T cells in KC;Tcrδ−/− hosts (Figure S5e). Moreover, similar to the 
orthotopic KPC model, pancreas-draining CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in KC mice upregulated 
IFN-γ (Figure S5f) and T-bet (Figure S5g) in the context of γδT cell deletion whereas 
CD4+ T cell expression of GATA-3 and FoxP3 were unaffected by γδT cell deletion (Figure 
S5h, i).
To definitively test whether enhanced αβT cell immunogenicity accounts for the protection 
against PDA observed in γδT cell-deficient animals, we depleted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in 
Tcrδ−/− mice and WT controls coincident with KPC-derived orthotopic tumor challenge. 
Ablation of αβT cell populations did not accelerate tumor growth in WT hosts but 
completely reversed the tumor-protective effects of γδT cell deletion. These data suggest 
that tumor-protection in PDA-bearing Tcrδ−/− mice is mediated by αβT cells (Figure 5e). To 
test whether PDA-infiltrating γδT cell inhibition of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells requires direct 
cellular interaction, we activated spleen αβT cells in vitro using CD3/CD28 co-ligation 
alone or in the context of either co-culture with PDA-derived γδT cells or admixture with 
γδT cell-conditioned media. Direct γδT cell coculture prevented CD4+ and CD8+ T cells 
from adopting an activated CD44+CD62L− phenotype (Figure S6a, b) and expressing 
immune-modulatory cytokines (Figure S6c–e); however, γδT cell-conditioned media was 
non-inhibitory. These data suggest that γδT cells do not inhibit αβT cells via secreted 
factors but require direct cellular interaction.
Pancreas-infiltrating γδ
γδT cells express high T cell exhaustion ligands
We postulated that γδT cells may directly inhibit CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation. We 
discovered that PDA-infiltrating γδT cells in KC mice expressed high PD-L1 (Figure 6a) 
and Galectin-9 (Figure 6b) compared with absent expression of these ligands in spleen γδT 
cells. Similarly, γδT cells in orthotopic KPC tumors also expressed elevated PD-L1 and 
Galectin-9 (Figure 6c). Expression levels of PD-L1 and Galectin-9 in PDA-infiltrating γδT 
cells were markedly higher than in cancer cells and comparable with that of tumor-
infiltrating myeloid cell populations (Figure 6c). By contrast, PDA-infiltrating γδT cells 
expressed elevated B7-1 but low levels of other activating ligands including B7-2, ICOSL, 
and OX40L in orthotopic KPC (Figure 6d) and KC (not shown) tumors. Exhaustion ligand 
expression in myeloid or tumor cells in PDA was not affected by γδT cell deletion (Figure 
6e). Notably, besides regulating γδT cell expansion and activation, CCR2, CCR5, and 
CCR6 signaling were necessary for γδT cell expression of PD-L1 or Galectin-9 (Figure 6f, 
g). To determine whether these findings translated to human disease, we tested PD-L1 
expression in human PDA. Remarkably, PBMC γδT cells in PDA patients expressed 
elevated PD-L1 compared with absent PD-L1 expression in PBMC γδT cells from healthy 
subjects (Figure 6h). Moreover, PD-L1 was expressed in ∼50% of tumor-infiltrating γδT

 cells in human PDA (Figure 6i). Similarly, Galectin-9 was upregulated in human PDA-
infiltrating γδT cells (Figure 6j).
γδ
γδT cells inhibit αβ
αβT cell activation via checkpoint receptor ligation
Previous reports have shown that low PD-L1 expression is associated with improved survival 
in human PDA and that PD-L1 blockade in murine PDA protects mice longitudinally (Nomi 
et al., 2007). We postulated that γδT cells promote PDA progression by preventing αβT cell 
activation via checkpoint receptor ligation. To test this, we again activated spleen CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells in vitro using CD3/CD28 co-ligation alone or in the context of co-culture with 
PDA-derived γδT cells. Similar to our previous experiments, γδT cells prevented CD4+ 
(Figure 7a) and CD8+ (Figure 7b) T cells from adopting an activated CD44+CD62L− 
phenotype; however, γδT cell-mediated suppression was reversed with PD-L1 blockade. 
Further, whereas PDA-infiltrating γδT cells prevented αβT cell expression of TNF-α in 
vitro, this was again reversed by PD-L1 blockade (Figure 7c).
To definitively test whether γδT cells promote PDA progression in vivo via checkpoint 
ligand-dependent immune-suppression, we serially blocked PD-L1 or Galectin-9 using 
neutralizing mAbs in cohorts of WT and Tcrδ−/− mice challenged with orthotopic KPC-
derived tumor. Consistent with our hypothesis, PD-L1 or Galectin-9 blockade protected WT 
mice but were ineffective at further inducing tumor-protection in Tcrδ−/− animals (Figures 
7d). Moreover, αPD-L1 and αGalectin-9 each substantially increased αβT cell infiltration 
of PDA in WT mice (Figure 7e) but failed to enhance αβT cell infiltration in Tcrδ−/− hosts 
(not shown). Similarly, both PD-L1 and Galectin-9 blockade in vivo induced an activated 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell phenotype in orthotopic PDA in WT mice but did not enhance αβT 
cell activation or Th1-polarization in PDA in Tcrδ−/− hosts (Figure 7f, g and S6f, g). To 
determine whether checkpoint ligand antagonism was also only efficacious in γδT cell-
competent hosts in a slowly progressive model of PDA, we serially treated cohorts of 6 week 
old KC;Tcrδ+/+ and KC;Tcrδ−/− mice for 8 weeks with an αPD-L1 mAb. Again, PD-L1 
inhibition protected KC pancreata from oncogenic progression but offered no benefit in 
KC;Tcrδ−/− mice (Figure S6h). Moreover, adoptive transfer of PDA-entrained γδT cells to 
Tcrδ−/− mice coincident with orthotopic tumor challenge resulted in tumor growth rates 
comparable to WT mice (Figure S6i). However, ex-vivo blockade of PD-L1 in γδT cells 
prior to adoptive transfer failed to accelerate tumor growth (Figure S6j). To determine 
whether PDA-infiltrating γδT cells abrogate antigen-restricted anti-tumor immunity in a 
PD-L1 dependent manner, we directly inoculated PDA-infiltrating γδT cells into established 
subcutaneous PDA tumors engineered to express OVA in Tcrδ−/− hosts. γδT cell 
administration again accelerated tumor growth and concomitantly diminished OVA-specific 
CD8+ T cell proliferation and activation. However, ex-vivo blockade of PD-L1 blockade in 
γδT cells abrogated their tumor-promoting and immune-suppressive effects (Figure S6k–m). 
Collectively, these data imply γδT cells are important mediators of checkpoint receptor 
dependent immune-suppression in PDA.
Notably, whereas γδT cell deletion augmented αβT cell infiltration and activation in PDA, it 
did not alter the fraction of PDA-infiltrating MDSCs or tumor-associated macrophages 
(TAMs) (Figure S7a). Similarly, γδT cell deletion did not affect the capacity of MDSCs or

 TAMs to mitigate T cell proliferation in PDA (Figure S7b, c). Further, in contrast to the 
exhaustion ligand-dependent immune-suppressive effects of γδT cells, PDA-infiltrating 
MDSC inhibition of αβT cell activation was independent of PD-L1 and macrophage-
mediated inhibition was only partially mitigated by PD-L1 blockade based on αCD3/
αCD28-mediated αβT cell proliferation (Figure S7b, c), expression of TNF-α (Figure S7d, 
e) and adoption of a CD44+CD62L− phenotype (not shown). Moreover, whereas αβT cells 
were in intimate proximity with γδT cells in the PDA TME, myeloid cells were separated 
by great distances from αβT cells in situ in human PDA (Figure S7f), in invasive murine 
PDA (Figure S7g) and in pre-invasive disease (not shown) suggesting enhanced opportunity 
for direct γδT cell–αβT cell interaction and limited opportunity for direct cross-talk 
between macrophages and αβT cells. Similarly, whereas αβT cells were in direct contact 
with PD-L1+ γδT cells (Figure S7h), αβT cells were not in close proximity of PD-L1+ 
epithelial cells (Figure S7i).
Discussion
Immune suppressive inflammation is paramount for PDA progression. Murine modeling of 
PDA using animals that endogenously express pancreas-specific oncogenic Kras revealed 
that pancreatic dysplasia is preceded by and accompanied by vigorous pancreatitis 
(Hingorani et al., 2003). Moreover, a driving oncogenic mutation alone is insufficient for 
disease progression and concomitant pancreatitis is necessary for PDA development (Guerra 
et al., 2007). The peri-pancreatic immune infiltrate is rife with immune-suppressive elements 
that support oncogenesis. In particular, innate immune cells within the TME are apt at 
educating adaptive immune effectors towards a tumor-permissive phenotype. APC 
populations, including M2-polarized TAMs and myeloid dendritic cells, induce the 
generation of PDA-promoting Th2 cells over Th1 cells that facilitate cytotoxic T 
lymphocytes (CTL) (Ochi et al., 2012c; Zhu et al., 2014). Similarly, we and others have 
shown that GM-CSF-recruited MDSC negate anti-tumor CD8+ CTL responses in PDA and 
promote metastatic progression (Bayne et al., 2012; Connolly et al., 2010; Pylayeva-Gupta 
et al., 2012). Effector T cells are also thought to be excluded from the PDA TME by 
CXCL12 produced by a subset of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts which express fibroblast 
activation protein (FAP) (Feig et al., 2013). However, a comprehensive understanding of the 
basis for T cell scarcity and poor immunogenicity in PDA is lacking.
γδT cells have not been well-characterized in PDA and their role in the programming of the 
TME remains ill-defined. We found that γδT cells are pervasive in human and murine PDA 
and tumor infiltration with γδT cells promotes oncogenic progression whereas genetic 
deletion, therapeutic depletion, and blockade of recruitment of γδT cells markedly delays 
morphologic transformation of the pancreas and increases median animal survival by nearly 
one year in a slowly progressive model of PDA. In contrast to our findings, γδT cells have 
long been considered potent anti-tumor entities in diverse tumor subtypes (Cordova et al., 
2012; Todaro et al., 2009). In melanoma, renal cell cancer, and colon cancer the putative 
protective effects of γδT cells have led to strategies employing exogenous activation of γδT 
cells to maximize their tumoricidal activity in vivo (Gao et al., 2003; Girardi et al., 2001; 
Lanca and Silva-Santos, 2012). While our findings are ostensibly paradoxical to the 
described function of γδT cells in these cancer models, we demonstrate that the γδT cells in

 PDA exhibit a unique phenotype. Most interestingly, PDA-infiltrating γδT cells express 
substantial FoxP3 which is absent in spleen γδT cells from the same animals. Endogenous 
FoxP3 expression in γδT cells has not been previously reported. However, FoxP3 can be 
induced in γδT cells upon in vitro stimulation with TGF-β in combination with TCRγδ 
ligation (Kang et al., 2009). Resultant FoxP3+ γδT cells are potently suppressive to T cell 
activation and proliferation. We found that chemokine signaling does not influence γδT cell 
expression of FoxP3 in PDA. However, we and others have shown that the PDA TME is rife 
with TGF-β which can possibly induce FoxP3 expression (Goggins et al., 1998; Greco et al., 
2015). Also consistent with a tumor-permissive phenotype, human PDA-infiltrating γδT 
cells do not express the Vγ9 TCR whose ligation has been implicated in the direct 
tumoricidal activity of γδT cells in melanoma and colon cancer (Izumi et al., 2013; 
Kunzmann et al., 2012).
While most early reports suggested that γδT cells were notable for their anti-cancer 
properties, emerging data suggest that γδT cells can have pro-tumorigenic effects. Select 
subsets of tumor infiltrating γδT cells in breast cancer block the maturation of TLR8-
sensitive dendritic cells and their capacity to prime αβT cells (Peng et al., 2007). In murine 
B16 melanoma, Vγ4+ and Vγ1+ subsets of γδT cells reportedly have opposing roles in 
tumorigenesis with Vγ4+ cells mediating protective anti-tumor immunity via IFNγ and 
perforin, whereas Vγ1+ cells produce tumor-permissive Th2-family cytokines (Hao et al., 
2011). By contrast, in PDA we found that tumor-promoting γδT cells are almost exclusively 
Vγ4+Vγ1−. Coffelt et al. showed in breast cancer models that IL-17 expression from γδT 
cells results in G-CSF-dependent expansion of neutrophils which acquire the ability to 
suppress anti-tumor CTL activity (Coffelt et al., 2015). Similarly, IL-17 production by γδT 
cells in murine hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer models mediates MDSC 
infiltration and their subsequent inhibition of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (Ma et al., 2014; Wu et 
al., 2014). By contrast, we demonstrate that deletion of γδT cells in PDA does not influence 
the fraction of myeloid cells in the TME nor does it affect their functional capacity to 
suppress T cell proliferation. Consistent with recent reports, we show that PDA-infiltrating 
γδT cells express high IL-17 which can directly promote pancreatic oncogenesis via ligation 
of IL-17R on transformed epithelial cells (McAllister et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2015). 
However, our cumulative data suggest that IL-17 may not be critical to the pro-tumorigenic 
effects of PDA-infiltrating γδT cells since blockade of select chemokine signaling mitigated 
γδT cell infiltration, activation, and exhaustion ligand expression and was protective against 
PDA despite IL-17 expression being unaffected. Further, our in vitro correlative studies 
suggested that secreted factors in γδT cell conditioned media were non-inhibitory to CD4+ 
and CD8+ T cell activation.
We demonstrate that γδT cells create an immune-suppressive adaptive TME through 
checkpoint receptor ligation in tumor-infiltrating αβT cells. Deletion of γδT cells in PDA 
results in a robust influx of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, in the absence of γδT 
cells, CD4+ T cells exhibit accentuated Th1-differentiation and CD8+ T cells exhibit a 
heightened cytotoxic phenotype. Moreover, whereas deletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells did 
not accelerate tumor progression in γδT cell-competent hosts, in Tcrδ−/− mice αβT cell 
deletion nearly tripled the rate of PDA growth. This observation supports the notion that

 αβT cells are entirely dispensable in PDA, but are reprogramed into powerful anti-tumor 
entities in the absence of γδT cells.
The volume of T cell exhaustion ligand levels in carcinomas, including in PDA, has been 
largely attributed to expression from tumor cells and macrophages (Nomi et al., 2007; 
Sharma and Allison, 2015). However, we show that γδT cells express considerably higher 
levels of PD-L1 and Galectin-9 in PDA than cancer cells. More importantly, we demonstrate 
that γδT cells are important contributors to PD-L1 and Galectin-9 induced T cell exhaustion 
in the TME based on our observation that inhibition of PD-L1 and Galectin-9 in PDA is 
protective in vivo in the presence of γδT cells, whereas in absence of γδT cells PD-L1 or 
Galectin-9 blockade offers no additional tumor-protective benefit. Even more, PD-L1 or 
Galectin-9 blockade expand and potently activate PDA-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells 
in γδT cell-competent hosts but do not enhance αβT cell immunogenicity in the absence of 
γδT cells. It is perhaps surprising that checkpoint receptor blockade would not have potency 
in Tcrδ−/− mice considering the substantial myeloid cell infiltrate in PDA (Liou et al., 2015; 
Pylayeva-Gupta et al., 2012). Indeed we found that myeloid cells from Tcrδ−/− mice have 
equivalent T cell inhibitory capacity to their cellular counterparts in WT mice. However, we 
found that whereas αβT cells are in intimate proximity to γδT cells in the PDA TME, 
myeloid cells are separated by great distances from αβT cells in situ in human PDA, 
invasive murine PDA, and pre-invasive disease suggesting enhanced opportunity for γδT 
cell-αβT cell interaction and limited opportunity for direct cross-talk between macrophages 
and αβT cells. Further, tumor cell expression of exhaustion ligands is also possibly of lesser 
significance as T cells are excluded from direct contact with tumor cells via CXCL12 
produced from FAP-expressing carcinoma-associated fibroblasts in PDA (Feig et al., 2013; 
Joyce and Fearon, 2015). Collectively, these data may suggest that αβT cells are prevented 
from having immunogenic relevance in PDA via a “double-hit”: fibroblast-mediated 
chemokine signaling excludes αβT cells from the direct tumor environs where γδT cells 
serve to check their activation via ligation of inhibitory receptors.
In summary, we show that PDA-infiltrating γδT cells are a highly influential lymphocyte 
subset in human and murine PDA which promote pancreatic oncogenesis and reduce 
survival via novel cross-talk with the adaptive immune compartment. These data implicate 
γδT cells as high-yield targets for the development of experimental therapeutics in PDA and 
has potential implications for the mechanistic progression of oncogenesis in other cancer 
subtypes. Finally, γδT cells may have prognostic significance in PDA, and may be 
predictive of response to immunotherapeutic regimens.

 from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME). KC mice (gift of D. Bar-Sagi), which develop 
pancreatic neoplasia endogenously by expressing mutant Kras, were generated by crossing 
LSL-KrasG12D and p48Cre mice (Hingorani et al., 2003). Tcrδ−/− mice were crossed with 
KC mice to generate KC;Tcrδ−/− animals. Both male and female mice were used but 
animals were sex- and age-matched in each experiment. Randomization was not performed. 
There were no specific inclusion or exclusion criteria. Sample sizes for experiments were 
determined without formal power calculations. Data for control KC mice have been 
previously reported (Seifert et al., 2016). For orthotopic tumor challenge, mice were 
administered intra-pancreatic injections of tumor cells derived from KPC mice (1×105 cells 
in Matrigel) and sacrificed at 3 weeks as described (Zambirinis et al., 2015). For 
subcutaneous tumor challenge, KPC-derived tumor cells (1×106) engineered to express OVA 
using pCI-neo-cOVA (gift of Maria Castro; Addgene plasmid # 25097) were administered to 
the flanks of mice (Yang et al., 2010). In select experiments, FACS-sorted PDA-infiltrating 
γδT cells were orthotopicaly transferred (8×105) together with tumor cells or directly 
inoculated into subcutaneous tumors (3×105). In other experiments, animals were treated 
twice weekly with i.p. injection of neutralizing mAbs directed against TCR Vγ4 (UC3–
10A6, 8mg/kg), PD-L1 (10F.9G2, 5mg/kg), or Galectin-9 (RG9-1, 6mg/kg; all BioXCell, 
West Lebanon, NH). In select experiments CD4 (GK1.5; BioXCell) or CD8 (53-6.72; 
Monoclonal Antibody Core Facility, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY) T cells were 
depleted using previously described regimens (Bedrosian et al., 2011). Acute pancreatitis 
was induced using a regimen of seven hourly i.p. injections of caerulein (50 µg/kg; Sigma, 
St. Louis, MO) for two consecutive days as we have described (Bedrosian et al., 2011). 
Serum amylase and lipase levels were measured using commercial kits (Sigma) according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions. Animal procedures were approved by the NYU School of 
Medicine IACUC.
Human and Murine Cellular Isolation—Pancreatic leukocytes were harvested from 
mouse PDA as described previously (Ochi et al., 2012a). Briefly, pancreata were resected in 
total and placed in ice-cold PBS with 1% FBS with Collagenase IV (1 mg/mL; Worthington 
Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) and DNAse I (2 U/mL; Promega, Madison, WI). After 
mincing, tissues were incubated in the same solution at 37°C for 30 minutes with gentle 
shaking. Specimens were passed through a 70 urn mesh, and centrifuged at 350g for 5 
minutes. Human pancreatic tissues and PBMC were collected under an IRB approved 
protocol and donors of de-identified specimens gave informed consent. Sample sizes for 
human experiments were not determined based on formal power calculations. Human 
pancreatic leukocytes were prepared in a similar manner to mice. PBMC were isolated by 
overlaying whole blood diluted 3:1 in PBS over an equal amount of Ficoll (GE Healthcare, 
Princeton, NJ). Cells were then centrifuged at 2100 RPM and the buffy coat harvested as we 
have described (Rehman et al., 2013).
Method Details
Flow Cytometry and FACS sorting—Cells were suspended in ice-cold PBS with 1% 
FBS. After blocking FcyRIII/II with an anti-CD16/CD32 mAb (eBioscience, San Diego, 
CA), cell labeling was performed by incubating 106 cells with 1 µg of fluorescently 
conjugated antibodies directed against murine CD45 (30-F11), CD3 (17A2), CD4 (RM4–5),

and FoxP3 (FJK-16s; all eBioscience). OVA-restricted CD8+ T cell proliferation was 
determined using an H-2kb SIINFEKL OVA Pentamer (Prolmmune, Oxford, United 
Kingdom). Intracellular staining was performed using the FoxP3 Fixation/Permeabilization 
Solution Kit (eBiosciences). Analysis of human cells was performed using fluorescently 
conjugated antibodies directed against CD45 (HI30), CD3 (SK7), CD45RA (HI100), CD27 
(0323), CD62L (DREG-56), CD14 (HCD14), PD-L1 (29E.2A3), Galectin 9 (9M1–3), CD15 
(W6D3), CD11c (3.9), Vγ9 (B3; all Biolegend), Tcrγ/δ (B1.1; eBioscience). Flow 
cytometry was performed on the LSR-II (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cytokine 
levels in cell culture supernatant were measured using a cytometric bead array (BD 
Biosciences). FACS-sorting was performed on the SY3200 (Sony, Tokyo, Japan). Data were 
analyzed using FlowJo (Treestar, Ashland, OR).
Western Blotting—Cells or tissues were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer. Total protein was 
quantified using the BioRad DC Protein Assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions 
(BioRad, Hercules, CA). Western blotting was performed as described previously with 
minor modifications (Ochi et al., 2012a). Briefly, 10% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels 
(NuPage; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were equiloaded with 10–30µg protein, electrophoresed 
at 200 V and electrotransferred to PVDF membranes. After blocking with 5% BSA, 
membranes were probed with primary antibodies to Bcl-XL (54H6), Rb (D20), c-Myc 
(D84C12), PTEN (26H9), p53 (1C12), and β-actin (8H10D10), all Cell Signaling, Beverly, 
MA. Blots were developed by ECL (Thermo Scientific, Asheville, NC).
Histology, Immunohistochemistry, and Microscopy—For histological analysis, 
pancreatic specimens were frozen in OCT medium or fixed with 10% buffered formalin, 
dehydrated in ethanol, embedded with paraffin, and stained with H&E or Gomori’s 
Trichrome. The fraction of preserved acinar area was calculated as previously described 
(Ochi et al., 2012a). The fraction and number of ducts containing all grades of PanIN lesions 
was measured by examining 10 high-power fields (HPFs; 40X) per slide. PanFNs were 
graded according to established criteria (Hruban et al., 2001): In PanIN I ducts, the normal 
cuboidal pancreatic epithelial cells transition to columnar architecture (PanIN Ia) and gain 
polyploid morphology (PanIN Ib). PanIN II lesions are associated with loss of polarity. 
PanIN III lesions, or in-situ carcinoma, show cribriforming, budding off of cells, and luminal 
necrosis with marked cytological abnormalities, without invasion beyond the basement 
membrane. Slides were evaluated by an expert pancreas pathologist (CH). 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using antibodies directed against CD4 (RM4–
5; BD Bioscience), CD8 (YTS169.4; Abcam), GFP (D5.1; Cell Signalling) and TCRγ/δ

 (B1; Biolegend). Quantifications were performed by assessing 10 HPF per slide. For 
immunofluorescent staining, frozen specimens were probed with antibodies directed against 
TCRγ/δ (GL3; Biolegend), TCRaP (H57–597; Biolegend), PD-L1 (Polyclonal, Abcam), 
CK19 (Troma-III; University of Iowa) or CD11b (M1/70; Biolegend). For analysis of human 
tissues, frozen sections of human pancreatic cancer specimens were probed with antibodies 
directed against TCRγ/δ (B1.1; eBioscience), TCRαβ (IP26; Biolegend), or CD11b 
(M1/70; Biolegend). Images were acquired using the Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope 
along with ZEN software (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, New York). The proximity of αβT cells 
to γδT cells or CD1 1b+ cells, respectively, was determined by measuring the distance 
between each αβT cell and its spatially closest counterpart. Distances were measured in 
micrometers on low power fields (20X). The averages distances were calculated for 10 low 
power fields per pancreas.
Intravital Imaging—Orthotopic pancreas tumor-bearing C57BL/6-Trdctm1Mal mice were 
anesthetized and a left subcostal laparotomy incision was made. The spleen and pancreatic 
tumor were externalized. The mouse was then placed prone on a heated (37°C) stage 
mounted with a coverslip which was in contact with the pancreatic tumor. To visualize the 
pancreatic vasculature, mice were injected i.v. with 25 µg Evan Blue (Sigma) 10 min before 
imaging. Images were acquired with a LSM 710 inverted microscope (Zeiss) with a MaiTai 
Ti:Sapphire laser (Spectra-Physics, Santa Clara, CA) tuned to 910–930 nm. Emitted 
fluorescence was detected through 420/40, 465/30, 520/30, 575/70, and 660/50 nm band-
pass filters and nondescanned detectors to generate second harmonic signals (collagen 
fibers) and 4-color images. All the images were acquired at least 50 µm below the tumor 
capsule. ZEN software was used for analysis.
In vitro T cell activation assays—For T cell activation assays, spleen CD4+ or CD8+ T 
cells (5xl04) were labeled with CFSE (eBioscience) and plated alone or with PDA-
infiltrating γδT cells, MDSC, or TAMs (5:1 ratio) in 96 well plates coated with anti-CD3 
(145-2C11, 10µg/ml) and anti-CD28 (37.51; 10µg/ml, both Biolegend). After 72 hours, αβT 
cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. In selected experiments, cells were 
treated with a neutralizing mAb directed against PD-L1 (10F.9G2, 10µg/ml; BioXCell).
Quantification and Statistical Analysis
Statistical Analysis—Data is presented as mean +/− standard error. Survival was 
measured according to the Kaplan-Meier method. The sample size for each experiment, n, is 
included in the results section and the associated figure legend. Statistical significance was 
determined by the Student’s t test and the Wilcoxon test using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad 
Software, La Jolla, CA). P-values <0.05 were considered significant. P values for each 
experiment are also included in the associated figure legends.
