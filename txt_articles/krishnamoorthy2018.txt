Severe asthma is a debilitating and treatment refractory disease. As many as half of these patients have complex 
neutrophil-predominant lung inflammation that is distinct from milder asthma with type 2 eosinophilic inflam-
mation. New insights into severe asthma pathogenesis are needed. Concomitant exposure of mice to an aeroal-
lergen and endotoxin during sensitization resulted in complex neutrophilic immune responses to allergen alone 
during later airway challenge. Unlike allergen alone, sensitization with allergen and endotoxin led to NETosis. 
In addition to neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), enucleated neutrophil cytoplasts were evident in the lungs. 
Surprisingly, allergen-driven airway neutrophilia was decreased in peptidyl arginine deiminase 4–deficient mice 
with defective NETosis but not by deoxyribonuclease treatment, implicating the cytoplasts for the non–type 2 
immune responses to allergen. Neutrophil cytoplasts were also present in mediastinal lymph nodes, and the 
cytoplasts activated lung dendritic cells in vitro to trigger antigen-specific interleukin-17 (IL-17) production from 
naïve CD4+ T cells. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with severe asthma and high neutrophil counts had 
detectable NETs and cytoplasts that were positively correlated with IL-17 levels. Together, these translational 
findings have identified neutrophil cytoplast formation in asthmatic lung inflammation and linked the cytoplasts 
to T helper 17–mediated neutrophilic inflammation in severe asthma.
INTRODUCTION
Asthma is a common inflammatory disorder of the airways with 
several underlying endotypes and excess morbidity (1–4). About 
10% of patients have severe disease, which responds poorly to corti-
costeroids and can be associated with neutrophil predominant in-
flammation and high interleukin-17 (IL-17) levels (5–8).
In response to inflammatory stimuli, neutrophils form neutro-
phil extracellular traps (NETs). NETosis releases DNA-containing 
NETs from cells that may result in the formation of enucleated cell 
bodies called cytoplasts (9). When nuclei are removed ex vivo, neu-
trophil cytoplasts remain viable and demonstrate some residual cell 
functions (10–12). Extracellular DNA in NETs has vital roles in host 
defense (9, 13), yet these structures are also associated with organ 
injury and inflammation (14, 15). Roles for cytoplasts and NETs in 
asthma pathogenesis remain to be determined.
Here, in a preclinical model of allergic lung inflammation that in-
corporates both type 2 and non–type 2 immune responses, we identi-
fied neutrophil-derived cytoplasts in lungs and mediastinal lymph 
nodes. Cytoplasts activated lung dendritic cells (DCs) to differentiate 
naïve CD4+ T cells to antigen-specific T helper 17 (TH17) effectors. 
Some bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) collected from severe 
asthmatic patients had NETs and cytoplasts that were associated with 
increased IL-17 and BAL neutrophils. These findings have identified 
NETosis-derived cytoplasts in vivo and a pivotal mechanism for the 
cytoplasts to bridge innate and adaptive immune responses with rele-
vance to non–type 2 inflammation in severe asthma (SA) pathogenesis.

inflammation in mice (17, 18). We established a protocol in which 
mice were exposed to the common indoor allergen house dust mite 
(HDM) alone or in combination with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
for 3 days to sensitize the animals, followed by 4 days of rest and 
then 8 days of intranasal HDM challenge (see Materials and 
Methods and Fig. 1A). Although there was no significant difference 
after HDM challenge in BALF total cell counts between the two 
different sensitization approaches (Fig. 1B), leukocyte differential 
cell counts showed significantly higher neutrophil and lower eo-
sinophil numbers in mice sensitized with HDM and LPS (HDM/
LPS) compared with HDM and vehicle (HDM/Veh; Fig. 1C and 
fig. S1A). Despite 4 days of rest between sensitization with HDM/
LPS and airway challenge with HDM alone, BALF neutrophilic 
inflammation continued to be more prominent than eosinophilia, 
a response that was distinct from mice sensitized with HDM/Veh. 
Effector CD4+ T cells were next characterized in the mediastinal 
lung-draining lymph nodes (MLNs). At 4 days after sensitization 
(Fig. 1A, day 7), there was a significantly higher number of TH17 
cells in HDM/LPS-sensitized mice compared with HDM/Veh (Fig. 1, 
D and E, and fig. S1B).
Exposure to LPS and allergen promoted NETosis
Instillation of LPS in mouse airways can induce NETosis (14, 19, 20), 
so BALF were obtained 1 day after sensitization to address this

possibility (Fig. 2A, day 3). Significantly higher numbers of BALF 
cells were present with HDM/LPS sensitization compared with 
HDM/Veh (Fig. 2B) with predominant BALF neutrophilia (Fig. 2C 
and fig. S1C). Notably, some of the recruited neutrophils underwent 
NETosis in the lung, as evidenced by increased BALF DNA (Fig. 2D) 
and hypercitrullinated histone H3 [citH3 (Fig. 2E)]. Cytoplasts are 
largely devoid of DNA, so the presence of DNA in cells was tracked by 
flow cytometry using a cell-permeable DNA dye. Analyses of BALFs 
revealed the presence of CD45+CD11b+Ly6G+DNA+ neutrophils 
and CD45+CD11b+Ly6G+DNA− cytoplasts from HDM/

mice immediately after sensitization (Fig. 2F and gating strategy

allergen alone triggered NETosis in the lung with both DNA and 
cytoplasts present in vivo. In addition to the lung, cytoplasts were 
in MLNs where allergen exposure skewed effector T cells toward 
TH17 differentiation.
To determine the role of IL-17 after HDM/LPS exposure, we 
gave mice an anti–IL-17 antibody or control antibody (80 g per 
mouse, intraperitoneal route) before and during the sensitization 
phase (fig. S3A, protocol days −1 and 1). After challenge with 
HDM, the mice sensitized in the presence of the anti–IL-17 anti-
body had reduced BALF total cell numbers with a significant 
decrease in BALF neutrophils and concomitant increase in eosino-
phils (fig. S3B). Exposure to the anti–IL-17 antibody did not have 
a significant effect on lung cytoplast numbers after sensitization 
(fig. S3C). Together, these findings indicate that IL-17 production is 
downstream of NETosis but pivotal to lung neutrophil accumula-
tion with later allergen challenge.
Deoxyribonuclease instillation altered levels of NETs but not 
of neutrophilia
To address the potential impact of NET DNA, we instilled deoxy-
ribonuclease (DNase) during sensitization to disrupt the NETs in 
HDM/LPS-exposed mice. DNase led to a significant decrease in 
NETs compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) control 
(Fig. 3, A and B). With DNase, there was a modest decrease in BALF 
cells after HDM challenge (day 15; Fig. 3C) without significant 
changes in the percent or number of BALF neutrophils (Fig. 3, D 
and E). Macrophages and eosinophils were reduced in part, sug-
gesting a potential role for NETs in the recruitment of these cells 
(Fig. 3, D and E). Protease-free DNase (21) gave similar partial 
decrements in BALF macrophages without significant decreases in 
BALF neutrophils (fig. S4), consistent with a role for the cytoplasts 
rather than the NETs in neutrophilia after allergen challenge.
Neutrophil cytoplasts retained functional properties
To investigate whether the cellular remnants of NETosis have a 
functional role in responses to the environmental stimuli (i.e., 
HDM and LPS), we first sorted cells from murine lungs 3 days after 
HDM/LPS administration and then evaluated cellular responses. 
Neutrophils and enucleated cytoplasts were identified, and the 
majority of both cell types excluded trypan blue dye (>95%). 
Neutrophils (average diameter, 6.9 m) were significantly larger 
than the cytoplasts (average diameter, 3.3 m) that had expelled 
their DNA (Fig. 4, A and B). Notably, the cytoplasts were signifi-
cantly larger than microvesicles (~200 nm), exosomes (~100 nm), 
and cellular debris. To assess chemotaxis, we placed the sorted cells 
in a microfluidic device with a gradient established to leukotriene 
B4 (LTB4; 100 nM). The cytoplasts displayed chemokinesis but, 
in contrast to neutrophils, did not exhibit chemotaxis to LTB4 
(see movies S1 and S2 and Fig. 4, C to F). The cytoplasts moved 
more slowly than the neutrophils (Fig. 4G) and displayed random 
movement despite the LTB4 chemotactic gradient (Fig. 4H).
The cytoplast chemokinesis suggested an intact cytoskeleton, so 
phagocytosis was next assessed. After sorting, the cells were incu-
bated with pHrodo-tagged Escherichia coli particles that fluoresce 
after engulfment upon pH change in acidic phagolysosomes (see 
Materials and Methods). Before incubation, the absence of nuclei in

the cytoplasts was confirmed by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 
(DAPI) stain (Fig. 4I). After 1 hour, phagocytosis for both the cyto-
plasts and neutrophils was evident (Fig. 4J). The phagocytosis index 
was similar for each cell type (Fig. 4K). To assess their capacity for 
killing a lung relevant pathogen, we incubated sorted cytoplasts and 
neutrophils with Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotype 1). Notably, 
the cytoplasts displayed killing of the bacteria to a comparable 
extent as autologous neutrophils (Fig. 4L). Together, these data 
indicate that the cytoplasts display several preserved functional 
responses of their parent neutrophils.
Deficiency in PAD4 resulted in reduced cytoplast  
generation and IL-17 levels
Because DNase did not affect neutrophil responses to allergen 
challenge and cytoplasts retained select cellular functions, we next 
turned to peptidyl arginine deiminase 4–deficient (PAD4 KO) mice 
with defective NETosis (22). PAD4 hypercitrullinates histones and 
is involved in NETosis (22, 23). After sensitization with HDM/LPS, 
PAD4 KO mice had reduced numbers of BALF total cells (day 30; 
Fig. 5A) and neutrophils (Fig. 5B). Western blots of lung homoge-
nates showed decreased citH3 in PAD4 KO mice during HDM/LPS 
sensitization (Fig. 5, C and D). By flow cytometry criteria (see Ma-
terials and Methods), cytoplast numbers were also much decreased in 
the PAD4 KO mice (Fig. 5, E and F), suggesting decreased NETosis 
in PAD4 KO mice in response to HDM/LPS. In addition, about 7% 
of wild-type (WT) neutrophils were citH3+ by flow cytometry, in-
dicative of an association with NETs (fig. S5). The numbers of citH3+ 
neutrophils in PAD4 KO mice were substantially decreased, and 
neutrophil cytoplasts were citH3− (fig. S5). Upon HDM challenge, 
BALF total cell counts in PAD4 KO were significantly lower than

WT mice (Fig. 5G), and BALF neutrophil counts were significantly 
decreased (Fig. 5H). Changes in BALF eosinophils were not signifi-
cant (Fig. 5H). After HDM/LPS sensitization and HDM challenge, 
lung histology was notable for decreased inflammation in PAD4 KO 
mice relative to WT mice (Fig. 5I). The PAD4 KO mice also had 
decreased airway mucous cell metaplasia [by periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) 
stain; Fig. 5J] and decreased methacholine (MCh)–induced airway 
responsiveness compared with WT mice (Fig. 5K). Cytokine produc-
tion from lung cells after HDM challenge from the two groups of 
mice was compared. PAD4 KO mice displayed lower levels of cellular 
IL-17 and interferon- (IFN-; Fig. 5L). Type 2 cytokines were not sig-
nificantly changed in the PAD4 KO mice (Fig. 5M). Together, these 
data indicate that cytoplasts produced by NETosis during HDM/LPS 
sensitization were related to an adaptive inflammatory response char-
acterized, in part, by neutrophilic lung inflammation and IL-17 and 
IFN- production in response to the HDM challenge.
Airway cytoplasts elicited IL-17 production by  
antigen-specific T lymphocytes
If NETosis-derived cytoplasts could direct neutrophil-enriched 
adaptive inflammatory responses, then cytoplasts and neutrophils 
should have distinct effects on allergen-initiated inflammation. 
To test this hypothesis, we isolated lung DCs from HDM/LPS- 
and HDM/Veh-sensitized mice for incubation with cytoplasts or 
neutrophils before naïve T cells from DO11.10 mice in the presence 
of ovalbumin peptide (Fig. 6A). In this in vitro reporter assay of cell-
cell interactions for antigen presentation and DC initiation of 
adaptive T cell effector responses, there was a higher abundance of 
antigen-specific CD4+ TH17 cells with cytoplasts compared with 
neutrophils (Fig. 6B). The cytoplast-mediated skewing to TH17 
was dose-dependent for the two DC/cytoplast cell ratios tested 
(1:0.5 and 1:2) and greater than that observed with DC/neutrophil 
ratio of 1:0.5, 1:2, and even an excess ratio of 1:10 (Fig. 6B and 
fig. S6). DCs from both HDM/LPS and HDM/Veh had similar 
responses, supporting a pivotal role for the cytoplasts in TH17 
differentiation. Because cytoplasts were present in BALF and MLN 
(Fig. 1), these results suggest that cytoplasts but not neutrophils in 
proximity to DCs can directly educate DCs to induce antigen- 
specific TH17 differentiation. The cytoplasts also triggered the ex-
pression of IL-13 from CD4+ T cells, although to a lesser extent than 
IL-17 (Fig. 6B). The DC-cytoplasts interaction was contact- 
dependent 
to trigger IL-17 and IL-13 production because the antigen-specific 
cytokine generation in vitro was abrogated when the cytoplasts 
were separated from DCs and T cells with a transwell culture system

(fig. S6). Conditioned media from cytoplast culture (24 hours) also 
failed to promote IL-17 and IL-13 production by the T cells (fig. S6). 
The data from these experiments highlight a bridging function for cy-
toplasts in programming an adaptive immune response in T cells that 
is contact-dependent and distinct from neutrophils.
Select cytoplast surface proteins are distinct  
from intact neutrophils
To begin to dissect the distinct DC responses to cytoplasts and neutro-
phils, we analyzed several surface proteins on cytoplasts and neutro-
phils by flow cytometry. Both cytoplasts and neutrophils displayed 
very low levels of annexin V expression (Fig. 7), and expression of CD32 
(FcyRII) was below the limits of detection on both cell populations. The 
expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on neutrophils and cytoplasts 
was comparable (Fig. 7). Notably, cytoplasts did not significantly ex-
press DC-SIGN (specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3–grabbing 
non 
integrin, also known as CD209), but cytoplasts did display sub-
stantial expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII), 
which was in contrast with neutrophils (Fig. 7). Even with this limited 
array of surface proteins, it is evident that there are select differences 
in cytoplasts and neutrophils that may account for their distinct and 
overlapping functions.

Briefly, DCs were harvested from the lungs of HDM/Veh- or HDM/LPS-sensitized mice and were incubated overnight with cytoplasts or neutrophils (PMNs) at the indicated 
cell ratios (top of plots) of DC/cytoplasts (1:2 and 1:0.5) and DC/PMNs (1:10). The HDM/Veh and HDM/LPS DCs were then cocultured with naïve CD4+ T cells from DO11.10 mice 
in the presence of ovalbumin (OVA) peptide, and T cells were restimulated and stained for intracellular cytokines (see Materials and Methods). (B) Representative flow 
cytometry plots showing T cells expressing the indicated cytokines. Numbers outside the box represent percentage of CD4+ T cells. Bar graphs (right) show the absolute

Cytoplasts correlated with IL-17 levels in the  
BALF of severe asthmatics
To determine whether NETosis was operative in human asthma, we 
first measured DNA levels in BALFs from patients with SA (n = 41) 
and non-SA (NSA; n = 28) and healthy donors (HDs; n = 25) in the 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Severe Asthma Research 
Program–3 (SARP-3; table S1). BALF DNA was measurable in a 
subset of asthmatic individuals (Fig. 8A), particularly in samples from 
patients meeting the SARP-3 criteria for SA (see Materials and Methods). 
Increased levels of DNA in SA were principally identified in BALFs with 
neutrophils >5% (Fig. 8B). To more confidently identify DNA from 
NETosis, we detected citH3 by Western blot in SA BALF with high 
neutrophil counts (Fig. 8C). BALF levels of DNA in SA were strongly 
correlated with neutrophil count (Fig. 8D). In addition to BALF DNA, 
Fig. 7. Select cytoplast surface proteins are distinct from intact neutrophils. BALF from HDM/LPS-sensitized mice were stained with different antibodies to detect the 
expression of these markers on neutrophils and cytoplasts. The expression of the markers is shown in the flow cytometry plots along with the percentage of positivity for 
each cell population. This experiment was performed twice.

BAL cells from SA (n = 28) and NSA (n = 19) patients were analyzed 
for cytoplasts by flow cyto 
metry. Cytoplasts were identified as CD45+ 
CD66b+CD16+ 
DNA− with low side scatter (gating strategy in fig. S7). 
There was a strong positive correlation between BAL neutrophils and 
cytoplasts, and both cell types were associated with BALF IL-17 levels 
(Fig. 8, E and F). Of the asthmatic patients with high BAL neutrophils 
and DNA, there was an increased association with frequent asthma 
exacerbations (>4/year) and sinusitis (table S2). Together, these trans-
lational findings indicate that a subset of severe asthmatic individuals 
with neutrophil-predominant inflammation have active lung NETosis 
with an association between cytoplasts and IL-17 levels, suggesting 
that, similar to the preclinical model with HDM/LPS (Figs. 1 to 3), 
these enucleated cytoplasts can skew an adaptive immune response 
toward TH17 to propagate lung neutrophilia.
DISCUSSION
Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder (2, 24, 25). Although eosino-
philia and type 2 inflammation are prominent in at least 50% of 
asthma, some severe asthmatic patients have substantial neutro-
philia that is likely to indicate distinct pathogenic mechanisms 
(26–28). To understand how LPS exposure during sensitization could 
influence later responses to allergen challenge, we characterized the 
acute responses to sensitization and identified a marked increase in 
lung neutrophils and NETosis in the animals exposed to allergen 
with LPS. In addition to NETs, the resulting neutrophil cytoplasts were 
also detectable in the lung and MLNs. PAD4 KO mice had reduced 
NETosis during sensitization and decreased neutrophils and TH17 
responses to later allergen challenge. DNase treatment decreased 
BALF DNA levels and lung macrophages; however, lung neutrophils 
were not decreased. There was a trend for reduced allergen- 
initiated 
BAL eosinophilia that did not reach significance. Together, these 
findings implicate the neutrophil cytoplasts as an underlying mecha-
nism for the allergen-mediated TH17 responses. Administration of 
neutralizing antibody for either IL-17A or IL-17F given during al-
lergen sensitization can attenuate murine allergic lung inflammation 
and airway hyperreactivity (29), and here, administration of anti–
IL-17 antibody during the sensitization phase significantly decreased 
BAL total leukocytes and neutrophilia. IL-17 neutralizing antibody 
did not affect lung cytoplast numbers, supporting a role for IL-17A 
downstream from cytoplasts for allergen-initiated lung neutrophil 
recruitment. With neutrophils and neutrophil cytoplasts present in 
respiratory tissues, immune functions for both cell types were ex-
amined after isolation by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). 
The enucleated cytoplasts were smaller in size compared with neutro-
phils and retained membrane integrity (i.e., excluded trypan blue). 
Albeit smaller than neutrophils, the cytoplasts (3 to 4.5 m) were 
significantly larger than microvesicles or exosomes. The isolated cyto-
plasts were chemokinetic but differed from neutrophils by not exhibit-
ing chemotaxis to LTB4. The cytoplasts were mobile in the microfluidic 
chamber and exhibited random motion via pseudopods, consistent 
with the published properties of neutrophil cytoplasts from NETosis 
during bacterial infection (9). The phagocytic index of the cytoplasts 
for E. coli particles and for killing S. pneumoniae was comparable to 
neutrophils and similar to properties of neutrophil cytoplasts gener-
ated by ex vivo enucleation, which remain capable of phagocytosis 
of staphylococci (30–32). The phagocytic capacity of neutrophil cyto-
plasts after NETosis suggests sufficiently intact cytoskeleton and 
membrane integrity for functional cell responses. The comparable 
TLR4 staining in cytoplasts and neutrophils after LPS exposure also 
suggests a similar mechanism for sensing Gram- 
negative bacteria. 
Notably, NETosis and neutrophil cytoplasts have also been detected 
with Gram-positive bacteria, suggesting the presence of other TLR 
molecules on cytoplasts.
DCs are critical antigen-presenting cells that instruct CD4+ 
T cells to differentiate with a specific phenotype (33). The chemo-
kinesis of cytoplasts and their presence in the MLNs suggested cytoplast 
trafficking via lung lymphatics and their potential for spatiotem-
poral regulation of T cell priming. When cytoplasts were incubated 
with DCs, they promoted differentiation of “naïve CD4+ T cells to 
produce IL-17 in an antigen-specific and dose-dependent manner. 
The levels of IL-17 induced by the cytoplasts were about twofold 
higher than IL-13. Notably, neutrophils did not trigger this TH17 
immune response, suggesting that DCs were responding to the 
activated cytoplasts in a distinct manner than to the intact neutro-
phils. The antigen-specific nature of this response supports a directed 
role for this cell-cell interaction between the DCs and cytoplasts 
that is not simply a generalized alarm signal. Increased expression 
of MHCII on cytoplasts indicates the potential capacity to process 
and present antigen. The loss of augmented IL-17 and IL-13 produc-
tion when DCs and cytoplasts were separated in culture by transwell 
suggests that antigen presentation via MHCII during cytoplast con-
tact with DCs is a potential mechanism for cytoplast-mediated DC 
programming of T cell cytokine production. One caveat is that ad-
herent NET fragments on cytoplasts cannot be entirely excluded. If 
present, cytoplast-associated surface DNA would be another poten-
tial mechanism for cell activation. DC-SIGN expression on cytoplasts 
was low, so the mechanisms for T cell skewing to IL-17 production 
were likely independent of DC-SIGN. The ability of neutrophil cyto-
plasts to trigger a regulated TH17-driven immune response is remi-
niscent of previous reports that infected apoptotic cells can also 
promote TH17 differentiation (34).
To translate the murine findings to human asthma, we studied 
BAL samples from comprehensively phenotyped healthy and asth-
matic individuals. DNA, including hypercitrullinated histones consist-
ent with NETs, was present in a subset of severe asthmatic patients 
with high BAL neutrophil counts. In SA, BALF levels of DNA cor-
related to BAL neutrophils. Neutrophil cytoplasts were also detected 
in SA BAL with high neutrophil counts. BAL neutrophils and cyto-
plasts correlated with BALF levels of IL-17. Compared with asth-
matics with lower BAL neutrophil counts, the asthma patients with 
increased BAL neutrophils and NETosis were associated with fre-
quent exacerbations and sinusitis—asthma comorbidities linked to 
infections. Together, these findings support the notion that a subset 
of severe asthmatic patients has neutrophil-enriched inflammatory 
responses that are driven by cytoplast skewing to TH17 adaptive in-
flammation. Several studies have identified NETs in biospecimens 
from asthmatic patients (35), and some have linked the DNA to 
type 2 responses (36). In sharp contrast, intact neutrophil cytoplasts 
after NETosis have not been previously detected in human asthma 
or after murine responses to allergen. Neutrophil cytoplasts have 
been detected after NETosis in vivo with murine Gram-positive 
bacterial infection and in human Gram-positive abscesses (9), sug-
gesting that the findings here have uncovered a mechanistic link be-
tween innate and adaptive immune responses that is relevant more 
broadly to neutrophilic diseases. Many severe asthmatic patients do 
not benefit from anti-inflammatory therapy with corticosteroids, 
which can prolong neutrophil survival and delay their clearance

from asthmatic lungs (37, 38). A phase 2a anti–IL-17 receptor A 
antibody clinical trial did not demonstrate improvement in asthma 
symptoms in moderate to severe asthmatics (39); however, stratifi-
cation of the asthmatic patients by neutrophils and IL-17 levels was 
not performed. Markers of NETosis, such as DNA-citrullinated his-
tones or neutrophil cytoplasts in sputum, may provide an opportu-
nity for increased precision or alternate therapeutic strategies to 
disrupt IL-17 pathways in subsets of asthma patients in future clini-
cal research.
In summary, during allergen-mediated responses, the presence 
of endotoxin can trigger lung NETosis with functional roles for the 
enucleated cytoplasts to convey specific signals of neutrophil activa-
tion that can serve as pivotal effectors for initiation of TH17 differ-
entiation in a transition from innate to adaptive immune responses. 
Cell-cell interactions between neutrophil cytoplasts and DCs are 
spatiotemporally regulated and can elicit antigen-specific T cell 
responses with direct relevance to disease pathogenesis for some 
patients with SA and non–type 2 inflammation. Our translational 
results also suggest a broader role for NETosis-derived cytoplasts in 
initiating TH17-driven adaptive immune responses to pathogens 
that are crucial to host defense.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
Balb/c mice used for the asthma model were purchased from Charles 
River Laboratories. C57BL/6 mice, C.Cg-Tg(DO11.10) 
10Dlo/J mice, 
and control BALB/c mice were purchased from the Jackson Labora-
tory. PAD4 KO mice (C57BL/6 background) (22) were obtained as 
a gift from Y. Wang’s laboratory and were bred at Boston Children’s 
Hospital. The mice were backcrossed for more than 10 generation 
on the C57BL/6 background. Unless otherwise stated, age-matched 
male animals were used at 8 to 12 weeks of age. The animal proto-
cols were approved by the Animal Review Committee at Harvard 
Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital.
Fifteen-day model of allergic lung inflammation
For the intranasal instillations, animals were sedated using isoflu-
rane carried by oxygen. For allergen sensitization, 25 g of HDM 
(B70 source material, Greer Laboratories) with or without 1 g of 
LPS (E. coli O55:B5, Sigma-Aldrich) was instilled (intranasally) in 
30 l of normal saline once daily for 3 days (days 0 to 2). In some 
experiments, mice were sacrificed on day 3, and BAL was performed 
using PBS containing 0.6 mM EDTA. MLNs were also harvested on 
day 3 from some mice for analyses.
In other experiments, DNase (500 g per mouse in 50 l of PBS) 
or PBS control was instilled intranasally 6 hours after each sensitiza 
tion 
(days 0 to 2). For allergen challenge, mice were rested for 4 days after 
sensitization (days 3 to 6). In some experiments, MLNs were har-
vested on day 7 to study T lymphocyte differentiation. Beginning on 
day 7, 25 g of HDM in 25 l of saline was instilled (intranasally) 
once daily for 8 days (days 7 to 14). Mice were then sacrificed 24 hours 
later on day 15, BAL was performed, and MLNs were harvested for 
analyses. BALFs were centrifuged (400g, 10 min). Cell pellets were 
resuspended for analysis by flow cytometry or cytospin and staining 
with Diff-Quik stain to determine leukocyte differential counts.
In the anti–IL-17 experiments, two doses of anti–IL-17A (clone 
eBioMM17F3, Thermo Fisher Scientific) or control rat immunoglobulin 
G were administered to the mice (80 g, 100 l) via the intraperitoneal 
route 24 hours before the first sensitization with HDM/LPS (protocol 
day −1) and then during HDM/LPS sensitization (protocol day 1; 
fig. S3A). The sensitization phase was completed with HDM/LPS, 
followed by challenge with HDM. Twenty-four hours after the last 
HDM challenge, the cellular profile in the BALF was analyzed.
For AHR, the protocol was performed as described previously 
(40). Briefly, anesthetized mice were mechanically ventilated using 
a flexiVent (SCIREQ), and aerosolized methacholine (0, 3, 10, and 
30 mg/ml) was delivered in-line via the inhalation port for 10 s. 
Lung resistance was calculated to the baseline dose of methacholine 
(dose 0, PBS control).
Cell-free supernatants were subjected to analysis by Quant-iT 
PicoGreen double-stranded DNA quantitation assay (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) or immunoblot analysis for citH3 to detect NETs. For 
Western blot, rabbit polyclonal antibody to histone H3 (citrulline 2 + 
8 + 17, Abcam) was used. For MLN T lymphocyte analysis, MLNs 
were dissociated to achieve single-cell suspensions using a 5-ml poly-
propylene round-bottom tube with a 0.3-m filter cap. Harvested 
MLNs were crushed using the plunger of 1-ml syringe and ice-cold 
PBS with 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells from 
day 3 mice were then counted and analyzed for neutrophil and cyto-
plast infiltration. MLN cells harvested from day 7 mice were counted, 
and 2 × 106 cells in 2 ml of RPMI with 10% FBS, 1 mM Na pyruvate, 
1× penicillin/streptomycin mix, and gentamicin (5 g/ml). MLN cells 
were then restimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 
50 ng/ml), ionomycin (500 ng/ml), and GolgiStop for 96 hours at 
37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were then har-
vested, dissociated, and stained for intracellular cytokine staining 
using the FoxP3 Staining Kit (eBioscience), as per the manufacturer’s 
protocol.
Flow cytometry
Cell suspensions were stained in ice-cold PBS with or without 2% 
FBS on ice. The following antibodies were used for staining mouse 
cells: CD45 (clone 30-F11, BioLegend), Ly6G (clone 1A8, BD Bio-
sciences), CD11c (clone HL3, BD Biosciences), CD11b (clone M1/70, 
BioLegend), Siglec F (clone E50-2440, BD Biosciences), CD3e 
(clone 145-2C11, eBioscience), CD4 (clone GK1.5, BioLegend), IFN 
(clone XMG1.2, BioLegend), IL-17 (clone eBio17B7, eBio 
science), 
IL-5 (clone TRFK5, BioLegend), IL-13 (clone eBio13A, eBioscience), 
CD25 (clone PC61.5, eBioscience), CD44, CD62L (clone MEL-14, BD 
Biosciences), MHCII I-A/I-E (clone M5/ 
114.15.2, eBioscience), DC-
SIGN/CD209 (R&D Systems), CD32 (clone D34-485, eBioscience), 
TLR4/CD284 (clone SA15-21, BioLegend), and annexin V (BioLegend). 
Neutrophils were defined as CD45+CD11b+Ly6G+DNA+, and cyto-
plasts were defined at CD45+CD11b+ 
Ly6G+DNA−. Naïve T lym-
phocytes were defined as CD4+CD25−CD44lowCD62Lhi. Lung DCs 
were defined as CD45+ 
CD11c+ 
MHCII+ 
autofluorescencelow. The fol-
lowing antibodies were used to stain human cells: anti-CD45 PE-Cy7 
(HI30), anti-CD66b (G10F5), and anti-CD16 APC-Cy7 (3G8) (all from 
BioLegend). Vybrant DyeCycle Ruby (Life Technologies) was used to 
stain intracellular DNA. Data were acquired on BD FACSCanto II 
or BD LSRFortessa and analyzed using FlowJo v10. For cell sorting, 
FACSAria was used.
Neutrophil/cytoplast, DC, and T cell coculture assay
Two cohorts of mice were sensitized with HDM/LPS and HDM/Veh. 
Mice were sacrificed on day 3. BAL was performed in one cohort, and 
CD45+CD11b+Ly6G+DNA+ neutrophils and CD45+CD11b+Ly6G+

cytoplasts were flow-sorted from BALFs. From second cohort, 
harvested lungs were dissociated, and CD45+CD11c+MHCII+ DCs 
were flow-sorted. These DCs were then cocultured with either cyto-
plasts (DC/cytoplast cell ratios of 1:0.5 or 1:2) or neutrophils (DC/
neutrophil cell ratio of 1:0.5, 1:2, or 1:10) overnight. The next day, 
the spleens of DO11.10 were harvested and crushed using a 70-m 
cell strainer and a plunger from a 5-ml syringe with ice-cold PBS 
with 2% FBS to obtain single-cell suspension. Cells were then cen-
trifuged (800g, 6 min, 4°C). Red blood cells (RBCs) were then lysed 
using RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience), as per the manufacturer’s in-
structions. Cells were then washed and resuspended in PBS with 2% 
FBS, stained, and sorted for CD4+CD25−CD44loCD62Lhi naïve 
T lymphocytes. Naïve T lymphocytes were then added to the DCs 
(T cells/DC, 10:1), together with ovalbumin peptide (5 g/ml). In 
select experiments, the cytoplasts were separated from the DC/T cells 
by transwell. The cytoplasts were added to the transwell, allowing 
the flow of the media but preventing the cytoplasts from directly 
interacting with DCs and T cells. In addition, conditioned superna-
tant from cytoplast culture for 24 hours was added to the DC/T cell 
coculture to determine the potential role of soluble factors from 
cytoplasts in T cell differentiation. The cells were then cultured for 
96 hours, and T cell differentiation was assessed by restimulating 
with PMA (50 ng/ml), ionomycin (500 ng/ml), and GolgiStop. Cells 
were then harvested, dissociated, and stained for intracellular cyto-
kine staining using the FoxP3 Staining Kit (eBioscience), as per the 
manufacturer’s protocol.
Design and fabrication of the microfluidic assay
The in vitro microfluidic assay enables investigation of chemotaxis 
of neutrophils and cytoplasts with high temporal and spatial resolu-
tion. It has three key components: (i) cell loading channel, (ii) chemo-
attractant chambers, and (iii) an array of migration channels, which 
bridge the first two components. The cell loading channel and the 
chemoattractant chambers have a dimension of 200 m × 100 m 
(h × w). The migration channels have a dimension of 10 m × 10 m 
× 500 m (h × w × l). Each device has 10 identical units with a total 
number of 90 migration channels, which allows observation of hun-
dreds of cells in one experiment.
Device priming
First, the microfluidic device was placed in a desiccator under vacuum 
for 20 min to generate a negative pressure in the device. Immediately 
after the degassing process, 5 l of complete RPMI containing 100 nM 
LTB4 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) and 100 nM fibronectin 
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was introduced into the cell 
loading channel through the inlet port using a pipette. The tempo-
rary negative pressure pulled the media into the migration channels 
and chemoattractant chambers filling the device within 10 min. The 
cell loading channel was then washed with 10 l of fresh media to 
establish a chemogradient from the chemoattractant chambers 
(highest chemokine concentration) to the cell loading channel 
(lowest chemokine concentration). One microliter of mice neutrophils 
or cytoplasts at a concentration of 2 × 107/ml was introduced into a 
device. Afterward, the device was immersed by pipetting 4 ml of media 
into the well and was ready for the following time-lapse imaging.
Time-lapse imaging and analysis
The six-well plate was mounted on a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope 
equipped with a biochamber to maintain the temperature and gas 
conditions at 37°C and 5% CO2. For each condition, 20 images were 
taken at different locations in two identical devices using a 10× lens 
in bright field. The experiment was imaged for 6 hours with a 3-min 
interval between two imaging cycles. The sizes of neutrophils and 
cytoplasts were measured using Fiji ImageJ. The recruitment of 
neutrophils or cytoplasts was analyzed by counting the number of 
cells that entered the migration channels. The velocities and tra-
jectories of neutrophil chemotaxis and cytoplast chemokinesis were 
measured using TrackMate in Fiji ImageJ.
Phagocytosis assay
Neutrophils and cytoplasts were cell-sorted (see cell sorter methods) 
and plated on serum-coated slides (105 cells per slide). The cells were 
allowed to adhere to the slides at 37°C for 1 hour. E. coli particles 
conjugated to pHrodo Red dye (100 g/ml; Life Technologies) were 
added to neutrophils and cytoplasts. Slides were captured with Zeiss 
epifluorescence microscopy with filter sets for indicator dye of 
pHrodo Red (green excitation) or DAPI (blue excitation) 60 min after 
the addition of E. coli particles. Total cell count was obtained by 
enumerating cells on light microscopy. Phagocytosis index was 
determined by counting the number of cells stained positive for 
pHrodo Red relative to total cells.
Bacterial killing
Frozen stocks of S. pneumoniae were plated and grown for 12 hours 
at 37°C and 5% CO2. Fresh colonies were grown in 10 ml of Todd 
Hewitt Broth (0.5% of yeast extract) until log phase [OD600 (optical 
density at 600 nm) = 0.4 arbitrary units; ~1.5 × 109 colony-forming 
units (CFU)]. After centrifugation (2000 rpm, 20 min), cells were 
washed with sterile PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI with 
5% FBS. Sorted neutrophils or cytoplasts were incubated with 1 ml 
of solution of log-phase S. pneumoniae serotype 1 with a multiplicity 
of infection of 2 for 30, 60, and 120 min at 37°C and 5% CO2. At 
each time point, 50 l of the culture supernatant was serially diluted 
and plated on blood agar plates. The plates were incubated over-
night at 37°C and 5% CO2, and after counting the colonies, results 
were expressed as CFU of S. pneumoniae per milliliter.
Human patients
Adult patients 18 years of age and older with asthma and healthy 
controls were recruited to the SARP-3 (NCT01606826) between 
November 2012 and October 2014 by seven research centers in 
the United States. Patients were defined as having SA or NSA, as 
defined by the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic 
Society guidelines (41). Healthy individuals were nonsmokers with 
no history of lung disease, atopic disease, or allergic rhinitis. Written 
informed consent was obtained after institutional review board 
approval at each site. BAL was performed by instilling warm saline 
(three 50 ml of aliquots) into the right middle lobe. BALF was 
recovered, and BAL cells and cell-free BAL supernatant were frozen 
and stored at −80°C or liquid nitrogen and later shipped to Brigham 
and Women’s Hospital for analysis. Patient demographic informa-
tion is provided in table S1.
BALF IL-17 measurement
IL-17 was measured in cell-free BALF from asthma patients using a 
flow cytometry bead-based immunoassay (LEGENDplex, BioLegend).
Statistics
Results are expressed as mean ± SEM or mean ± SD, as stated in the

used. Correlations were evaluated by Pearson’s correlation coeffi-
cient (r). For table S2, comparisons between categorical vari-
ables were assessed by 2 test. P < 0.05 was defined as statistically

cytoplasts can contribute to asthma severity.
IL-17 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from severe asthmatics. These findings provide insight into how neutrophil 
cytoplasts alone were sufficient to induce IL-17 production by antigen-specific T cells. Cytoplasts also correlated with
allergen. Cytoplasts and not neutrophil DNA released in NETosis triggered neutrophilia upon allergen exposure, and 
allergen induced NET formation in the lung that was associated with IL-17 production upon subsequent exposure to
models of allergic lung inflammation and in asthmatic patients. Airway exposure of mice to LPS with house dust mite 
. examined how neutrophil cytoplasts contribute to asthmatic inflammation in mouse
et al
cytoplasts. Krishnamoorthy 
In addition to DNA release, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation can result in enucleated cells called
Nefarious neutrophil cytoplasts
