Abstract
Objective
To investigate the efficacy and safety of zonisamide as an adjunct to levodopa therapy for
parkinsonism in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).
Methods
This phase 2, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study consisted of run-in (placebo,
4 weeks) and treatment (placebo or zonisamide 25 or 50 mg once daily, 12 weeks) periods.
Outpatients diagnosed with probable DLB were eligible for inclusion. The primary endpoint
was the change from baseline in Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part 3 total
score at week 12. Cognitive function, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia
(BPSD), caregiver burden, other UPDRS parts as secondary endpoints, and safety were also
assessed.
Results
Overall, 158 patients with DLB received the study drug; 21 discontinued during treatment and
137 completed treatment. Improvement in UPDRS part 3 total score at week 12 was signifi-
cantly greater in the zonisamide 50 mg group compared with placebo (between-group differ-
ence −4.1; 95% confidence interval −6.8 to −1.4; p = 0.003). Zonisamide did not worsen
cognitive function, BPSD, or caregiver burden. The overall incidence of adverse events was
higher in the zonisamide 50 mg than the 25 mg and placebo groups (65.3%, 43.1%, and 50.0%,
respectively); similar rates of serious adverse events were observed among all groups.
Conclusion
Zonisamide (adjunctive to levodopa) improved parkinsonism accompanying DLB without
worsening cognitive function or psychiatric symptoms.
Clinical trial registration
JapicCTI-122040.
Classification of evidence
This study provides Class I evidence that zonisamide (adjunctive to levodopa) improves
parkinsonism and is well-tolerated in patients with DLB.

 Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is thought to be the
second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer
disease, accounting for 10%–15% of all patients with de-
mentia.1 Patients with DLB frequently complain of com-
mon
symptoms
including
hallucinations
and
parkinsonism, as well as other symptoms such as REM
sleep behavior disorder, severe neuroleptic sensitivity, and
autonomic nervous system disorders.1 DLB is one phe-
notype of Lewy body disease, which includes Parkinson
disease (PD), and is characterized by the expression of
Lewy bodies in the central and autonomic nervous sys-
tems. Furthermore, treatment with levodopa is beneficial
for symptoms of parkinsonism accompanying DLB.
However, conventional anti-Parkinson drugs including
levodopa should be prescribed with care because they can
induce psychiatric symptoms, such as hallucinations and
delusions.2
Zonisamide
(1,2-benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide),
widely used for epilepsy, has been available as an anti-
Parkinson drug (adjunctive agent in levodopa treatment) in
Japan since 2009. In 4 placebo-controlled, randomized
trials,3–6 zonisamide improved motor symptoms and the
“wearing-off” phenomenon, with a low incidence of motor
complications such as dyskinesia or psychiatric symptoms
such as hallucinations. The mechanism of action of zoni-
samide on PD has not been fully elucidated, but several
studies reported that zonisamide has multiple functions in
the dopaminergic (activation of dopamine synthesis and
release7 and inhibition of monoamine oxidase B8) and
nondopaminergic (blockade of sodium channels,9 T-type
calcium channels,10,11 and GABAergic transmission via
striatal
opioid
δ1-receptor-associated
interactions12)
pathways.
A previous study of 3 patients with DLB reported that
zonisamide improved parkinsonism and reduced caregiver
burden without deteriorating cognitive function or behav-
ioral or psychological symptoms13; these results were
supported in 2 case studies of 1 patient each.14,15 Therefore,
we hypothesized that zonisamide would be efficacious for
parkinsonism accompanying DLB without psychiatric
deterioration.
We conducted a phase 2, placebo-controlled, randomized,
double-blind study to investigate the efficacy and safety of
zonisamide in patients with DLB.
Methods
Participants
Inclusion and exclusion criteria at the start of the run-
in period
Outpatients diagnosed with probable DLB based on the
2005 version of the clinical diagnostic criteria for DLB2
who satisfied all of the following inclusion criteria and who
did not meet any of the exclusion criteria were eligible for
this study.
Major inclusion criteria included age 20–84 years; Unified
Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)16 part 3 total
score ≥10; Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)17 total
score 10–26; and administration of levodopa/decarboxylase
inhibitor (DCI) for ≥12 weeks before the run-in period with
the treatment regimen unchanged for the last 2 weeks.
Patients using antidementia drugs with no changes in the
dose/type of drugs administered for ≥12 weeks before the
run-in period were eligible. Patients using anti-Parkinson
drugs other than levodopa/DCI, antihypertensive drugs,
other CNS drugs, cardiovascular system drugs, gastroin-
testinal system drugs, or Yokukansan (a traditional Japa-
nese herbal medicine) were eligible, providing there were
no changes in the dose/type of these drugs administered
for ≥2 weeks before the run-in period.
Based on the DLB diagnostic criteria,2 we defined PD with
dementia (PDD) as well-established PD (i.e., as diagnosed by
a physician) followed by onset of dementia. Patients with
PDD or Parkinson syndromes other than DLB, patients who
did not respond to levodopa therapy, patients with a history of
treatment with zonisamide, and patients with epilepsy were
excluded from the study.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria at the start of the
treatment period
Patients remained eligible if they had a UPDRS part 3 total
score ≥10 with no changes in the dose/type of restricted
coadministered drugs such as anti-Parkinson drugs, anti-
hypertensive drugs, other CNS drugs, cardiovascular sys-
tem drugs, gastrointestinal system drugs, or Yokukansan
for the run-in period. Patients for whom the UPDRS part 3
total score changed by ≥20 from the initiation of the run-in
period and for whom the medicated rate was <80% were
excluded.

 Trial design and treatments
This multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-
blind, parallel-group comparison study compared the efficacy
of zonisamide (25 and 50 mg once daily) with placebo for
treating parkinsonism in patients with DLB. The study con-
sisted of a run-in period (4 weeks) and a treatment period (12
weeks). Placebo tablets were orally administered once daily
for 4 weeks during the run-in period under single-blind con-
ditions. The objective of the run-in period was to eliminate
any potential confounding effects of other anti-Parkinson
drugs.
The eligibility of patients was confirmed immediately before
the treatment period (baseline, week 0). Eligible patients were
randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups, and administered placebo
or zonisamide 25 or 50 mg once daily under double-blind
conditions. Participants visited the study sites every 4 weeks,
for a total of 5 visits.
The dosage and administration were unchanged throughout
the treatment period for test drugs, from 12 weeks before the
run-in period throughout the treatment period for anti-
dementia drugs, and from 2 weeks before the run-in period
throughout the treatment period for levodopa/DCI, other
anti-Parkinson drugs, and drugs listed in the Participants
section. Starting new drugs of these classes during the study
was prohibited. For anti-Parkinson drugs, dose reduction was
allowed when motor complications such as dyskinesia and
nonmotor adverse events (AEs) occurred, but dose re-
escalation was prohibited. Cessation or discontinuation of
levodopa/DCI and coadministration of zonisamide, benza-
mide antipsychotics, or other investigational new drugs were
prohibited.
This study was conducted at 60 medical institutions between
March 2013 and April 2014.
Standard protocol approvals, registration, and
patient consent
This study was reviewed and approved by the institutional
review board of each study site. It was conducted in compli-
ance with the Declaration of Helsinki, clinical study protocol,
Good Clinical Practice, and applicable regulations. All
patients/proxy consenters and caregivers provided written
informed consent. This study was registered with the Japan
Pharmaceutical Information Center (JapicCTI-122040).
Randomization and blinding
The study drug allocation table was prepared by the person
responsible for study drug allocation, securely sealed, and
stored until study completion. Patients were allocated using
a verified program (SAS 9.1; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)
with 3 patients allocated to each block (1 patient per group)
to ensure a ratio of 1:1:1 for placebo and zonisamide 25 and
50 mg groups. Block size was not disclosed to investigators.
Concealment of allocation sequence and blindness (for all
patients, caregivers, and attending physicians) were ensured
by double-dummy method and indistinguishability of study
drugs was confirmed before study initiation and at code
breaking. Randomization key codes were appropriately stored
until database lock.
Outcomes
For efficacy analyses, the primary endpoint was change from
baseline in UPDRS part 3 total score at week 12. Secondary
endpoints were changes from baseline in total scores of
UPDRS and each UPDRS part (parts 1, 2 [“on”], 4, and 1–4),
and scores of each UPDRS item at each evaluation time point.
Changes from baseline in total scores of the MMSE, Neuro-
psychiatric Inventory–10 (NPI-10),18 and Zarit Burden In-
terview (ZBI),19 as the respective evaluation indices of
cognitive function, behavioral and psychological symptoms of
dementia (BPSD), and caregiver burden were also evaluated
as secondary endpoints at week 12.
UPDRS was evaluated every 4 weeks (5 times in total).
MMSE, NPI-10, and ZBI were evaluated at the start of the
run-in period and at the beginning/end of the treatment pe-
riod (3 times in total). The baseline was defined as the start of
the treatment period for the primary endpoint; for secondary
endpoints, if the data were missing at that time, the baseline
was defined as the start of the run-in period. The sponsor
provided training to investigators for use of the UPDRS.
For safety analyses, laboratory test values, vital signs, and body
weight were measured at each visit, and 12-lead ECG at rest was
measured at screening, baseline, and weeks 4 and 12. AEs ob-
served between initiation and the end of the treatment period
were evaluated by each investigator, who recorded the following
information: type of AE, date of onset, seriousness/severity,
change (if any) made to the study drug in response to the AE,
treatment of the AE, outcome, and causal relationship to the
study drug. The investigator followed up with the patient until
the AE resolved or improved. If serious AEs occurred, the in-
vestigator immediately alerted the director at the investigator’s
institution in writing and the study sponsor. The schedule is
shown in table e-1 (links.lww.com/WNL/A180) and the study
flow is illustrated in figure e-1 (links.lww.com/WNL/A181).
Statistical analysis
The primary analysis population consisted of patients re-
ceiving at least one dose of study drug for the treatment
period with UPDRS part 3 total scores at baseline and any
score after the start of the treatment period (modified
intention-to-treat [mITT] population).
Superiority of zonisamide (25 and 50 mg) over placebo was
verified by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment
groups as fixed effects and baseline values as covariates. Missing
values for each UPDRS score at week 12 were supplemented
using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach.
Change from baseline was calculated as least squares mean
(LSM) ± SEM.

 Between-group differences (vs placebo) were presented as
LSM with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p values. For
the primary endpoint, multiplicity of comparisons of the
zonisamide groups and placebo was adjusted using the Fisher
least significant difference method.
ANCOVA was applied to the per protocol (PP) population,
and mixed-effect model repeated measures (MMRM) with
treatment groups and visits as fixed effects, baseline values as
covariates, and interaction between the groups and visits was
applied to the mITT population for sensitivity analyses. The
sample size calculation is described in the supplementary in-
formation (links.lww.com/WNL/A182).
Results
Patients
Although the study inclusion criterion was age 20–84 years,
the actual age range of patients enrolled was 56–84 years. Of
173 patients screened, 15 discontinued during the run-in
period, and 158 were randomized to receive the allocated
study drug (figure 1). Twenty-one patients discontinued
during the treatment period and 137 completed treatment.
The discontinuation rate during the treatment period was
moderately higher in the zonisamide groups (9 patients
[17.6%] for 25 mg and 7 [14.3%] for 50 mg) compared with
placebo (5 [8.6%]).
The mITT population consisted of 152 patients (55, 48, and
49 in placebo and zonisamide 25 and 50 mg groups, re-
spectively) after excluding 6 patients who lacked a UPDRS
part 3 total score at baseline or in the treatment period. All
158 randomized patients (58, 51, and 49 in placebo and
zonisamide 25 and 50 mg groups, respectively) were included
in the safety analysis.
In the mITT population, approximately 60% were men, and the
mean age was 75.1 years. Those aged <65 years and ≥75 years
constituted <10% and >60% of patients, respectively. The mean
duration after diagnosis of DLB was 1.5 years and the mean
durations of motor symptoms and dementia were 3.6 and 3.8
years, respectively. Of the core symptoms defined in the 2005
version of clinical diagnostic criteria for DLB,2 fluctuating cog-
nition and visual hallucinations were each present in approxi-
mately 70% of patients and motor dysfunction was present in all
patients. Levodopa dose and levodopa equivalent daily dose
were 279 ± 149 and 319 ± 192 mg/d, respectively. Dopamine
agonists were used by 19.7% of patients and other anti-Parkinson
drugs by <10% per drug. Antidementia and CNS drugs were
used in 75.0% and 37.5% of patients, respectively.
Baseline disease-related variables were similar among the 3
groups, except for a slightly higher proportion of patients aged
≥75 years in the placebo group and a slightly lower mean NPI-
10 total score at baseline in the zonisamide 25 mg group
(table 1).

 Efficacy
UPDRS part 3 total scores were decreased at week 12
(LOCF) in all groups compared with baseline, indicating
improved parkinsonism. Changes from baseline (LSM ±
SEM) were −2.1 ± 0.9, −4.4 ± 1.0, and −6.2 ± 1.0 in placebo
and zonisamide 25 and 50 mg groups, respectively; the change
in UPDRS part 3 total score was significantly greater in the
zonisamide 50 mg group (between-group difference −4.1;
95% CI −6.8 to −1.4; p = 0.003) and greater in the zonisamide
25 mg group (between-group difference −2.3; 95% CI −5.0 to
0.4; p = 0.099) compared with placebo (figure 2 and table e-2,
links.lww.com/WNL/A180).
Significant changes in UPDRS part 3 total scores were ob-
served between zonisamide 50 mg and placebo by ANCOVA
of the PP population (between-group difference −4.4; 95% CI
−7.2 to −1.5; p = 0.003) and MMRM analysis of the mITT
population (between-group difference −4.7; 95% CI −7.5 to
−1.9; p = 0.001).
The change in UPDRS part 3 total scores over time is shown
in figure 3. Although a decrease in the UPDRS part 3 total
score was observed from baseline at week 4 in all groups,
the score remained constant up to week 12 for placebo in
contrast with further decreases in the zonisamide groups. In
the zonisamide 50 mg group, the score was significantly lower
at week 8 (between-group difference −2.8; 95% CI −5.3 to
−0.4; p = 0.022) and week 12 (between-group difference −5.1;
95% CI −8.0 to −2.2; p < 0.001) compared with placebo. The
change from baseline for each total score for UPDRS part 1, 2
(“on”), 4, or 1–4 at week 12 (LOCF) in the zonisamide
groups was similar to placebo (table e-2, links.lww.com/
WNL/A180). The total scores for MMSE, NPI-10, and ZBI
did not change significantly from baseline in any group
(table e-2), suggesting administration of zonisamide did not
worsen cognitive function, BPSD, or caregiver burden.
Scores at baseline and changes from baseline at week 12 for
each item of UPDRS part 3, MMSE, and NPI-10 are shown in
tables
e-3,
e-4,
and
e-5
(links.lww.com/WNL/A180),
respectively.
Safety
The overall incidence of AEs was comparable between zoni-
samide 25 mg and placebo but was higher for zonisamide
50 mg (50.0%, 43.1%, and 65.3% for placebo and zonisamide
25 and 50 mg, respectively) (table 2). The number of dis-
continuations because of AEs was higher with zonisamide 25
and 50 mg than with placebo and included 2 patients (2
events) receiving placebo, 5 patients (6 events) receiving
zonisamide 25 mg, and 6 patients (6 events) receiving zoni-
samide 50 mg. The AEs leading to discontinuations were
colonic volvulus and anxiety disorder in the placebo group;
somnolence, upper abdominal pain, dysgeusia, drug eruption,
lung adenocarcinoma, and pneumonia in the zonisamide
25 mg group; and back pain, hallucinations, ileus, cognitive
disorder, rash, and decreased appetite in the zonisamide
50 mg group.
Serious AEs occurred in 3 patients (3 events), 4 patients (5
events), and 3 patients (4 events) in the placebo and
zonisamide 25 and 50 mg groups, respectively. The serious
AEs were dysphagia, aspiration pneumonia, lung adeno-
carcinoma, pneumonia, and rectal cancer in the zonisamide
25 mg group, and back pain, ileus, decreased appetite, and
chondrocalcinosis pyrophosphate (suspected pseudogout)
in the zonisamide 50 mg group. A causal relationship with
the study drug was denied for all events except decreased
appetite.
The incidences of common drug-related AEs (weight de-
creased, appetite decreased, and rash) were higher with

 zonisamide than placebo. The incidences of AEs related to
neurologic and psychiatric disorders such as hallucinations
and visual hallucinations, which are common symptoms of
DLB, were comparable between zonisamide and placebo
(table e-6, links.lww.com/WNL/A180). No clinically signifi-
cant changes in laboratory test values, vital signs, body weight,
or ECG findings were observed in any group.
Classification of evidence
This study provides Class I evidence that zonisamide (adjunctive
to levodopa) improves parkinsonism and is well-tolerated in
patients with DLB according to the classification scheme
requirements for therapeutic questions.20
Discussion
Zonisamide is effective for the treatment of motor symptoms
and wearing-off related to PD.3–6 In this study, we found that
the UPDRS part 3 total score at week 12 was significantly
improved in the zonisamide 50 mg/d group compared with
the placebo group of patients with DLB. The effect size of

 zonisamide 50 mg/d for DLB parkinsonism observed in this
study was similar to that for PD parkinsonism.3–5
We also demonstrated that zonisamide 50 mg significantly
improved UPDRS part 3 total scores compared with placebo
using both ANCOVA of the PP population and MMRM
analysis of the mITT population. Therefore, the results of
the analysis using the LOCF method appear to be robust.
UPDRS part 3 total scores decreased from week 4 onward
in all groups. The scores remained unchanged up to week
12 in the placebo group whereas a further reduction was
observed in the zonisamide 25 and 50 mg groups. There-
fore, adjunct zonisamide 50 mg to levodopa therapy may
improve motor symptoms in patients with DLB from week
8 of treatment.
In this phase 2 study, the incidence and severity of resting
tremor at baseline were lower than those of other symptoms
such as rigidity and akinesia/bradykinesia (table e-3, links.
lww.com/WNL/A180). This result is consistent with those
described in a review by McKeith et al.,2 where the incidence
of resting tremor was lower in patients with DLB than in
patients with PD.
The changes from baseline in MMSE, NPI-10, and ZBI total
scores were not significant in any of the 3 groups, indicating
that zonisamide did not worsen cognitive symptoms, BPSD,
or the burden of caregivers.
The incidence of AEs was comparable between the zonisamide
25 mg group and the placebo group, but was higher in the
zonisamide 50 mg group compared with placebo. The inci-
dences of weight decreased and appetite decreased were higher
in the zonisamide 25 and 50 mg groups compared with placebo.
These events are known treatment-related AEs of zonisamide
in patients with PD; therefore, we observed no previously un-
reported types of treatment-related AEs in patients with DLB.
There was no AE for which the severity intensified with in-
creased zonisamide dose. The incidence of somnolence,
a common AE in zonisamide-treated patients with PD, was
comparable between the zonisamide groups and placebo
group in patients with DLB.
Hallucinations and delusions are the most common psychiatric
symptoms observed with anti-Parkinson drugs for the treatment
of motor symptoms in patients with DLB. The incidence of
neurologic and psychiatric AEs, such as cognitive disorder, hal-
lucinations, and delusions, did not differ between the zonisamide
groups and the placebo group, which is consistent with the
results of the MMSE and NPI-10 evaluations.
Although these findings suggest zonisamide is clinically safe
and useful for the treatment of parkinsonism in patients with
DLB, it should be noted that this study was performed with
a relatively small number of patients. Further studies are
needed to investigate the efficacy of zonisamide in a large
number of participants.

Study question
Is zonisamide a safe and effective adjunct to levodopa therapy
for parkinsonism in patients with dementia with Lewy bod-
ies (DLB)?
Summary answer
Adjunctive zonisamide mitigates parkinsonism in patients
with DLB and is well-tolerated.
What is known and what this article adds
Levodopa can mitigate parkinsonism in patients with DLB,
but it may induce psychiatric symptoms. Zonisamide is a safe
and effective treatment for Parkinson disease, and this study
provides Class I evidence that it is an appropriate adjunct for
levodopa in patients with DLB.
Participants and setting
This study examined 173 patients at 60 Japanese centers from
March 2013 to April 2014. They were diagnosed with prob-
able DLB, had Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS) part 3 total scores ≥10, and had been taking
levodopa for ≥12 weeks.
Design, size, and duration
This double-blind trial block-randomized 158 patients to a pla-
cebo group (n = 58; ncompleted = 53), a zonisamide 25 mg group
(n = 51; ncompleted = 42), and a zonisamide 50 mg group (n = 49;
ncompleted = 42). All groups took tablets orally for 12 weeks.
Primary outcomes
The primary outcome was the from-baseline change in the
UPDRS part 3 total score at week 12.
Main results and the role of chance
At 12 weeks, all 3 groups had decreased UPDRS part 3 total
scores, indicating mitigation of parkinsonism. Relative to the
placebo group, the zonisamide 25 mg group was similar
(between-group difference −2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]
−5.0to0.4;p= 0.099),butgreaterinthezonisamide50mggroup
(between-group difference −4.1; 95%CI−6.8to −1.4; p= 0.003).
Harms
The incidence of adverse events in the zonisamide 50 mg
group (65.3%) was higher than those in the zonisamide 25 mg
group (43.1%) and the placebo group (50.0%). However,
zonisamide did not worsen cognitive function or the behav-
ioral or psychological symptoms of dementia.
Bias, confounding, and other reasons
for caution
This study was performed with relatively few patients studied
over a short period of time, with minimal ratings for
behavioral/psychological symptoms.
Generalizability to other populations
Between-country differences in genetics, lifestyle, and envi-
ronmental factors may limit the international generalizability
of this study’s results.
Study funding/potential competing interests
This study was funded by Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma, which
employs some of the authors. Some authors report receiving
honoraria from various pharmaceutical companies, including
the study funder, and receiving grants from the Japanese gov-
ernment. Go to Neurology.org/N for full disclosures.
