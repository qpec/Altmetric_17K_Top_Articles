In Brief
Fisette et al. demonstrate that the
endocannabinoid-degrading enzyme
ABHD6 in ventromedial hypothalamus
neurons is a regulator of VMH 2-AG
accumulation and energy metabolism
flexibility in response to homeostatic
challenges. ABHD6 knockout in VMH
neurons of adult mice impairs the feeding
response to fasting and increases
susceptibility to cold-induced
hypothermia, diet-induced obesity, and
resistance to diet-induced weight loss.

SUMMARY
a/b-Hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6) is a monoacylgly-
cerol hydrolase that degrades the endocannabinoid
2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Although complete
or peripheral ABHD6 loss of function is protective
against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance,
the role of ABHD6 in the central control of energy bal-
ance is unknown. Using a viral-mediated knockout
approach,
targeted
endocannabinoid
measures,
and pharmacology, we discovered that mice lacking
ABHD6 from neurons of the ventromedial hypothala-
mus (VMHKO) have higher VMH 2-AG levels in condi-
tions of endocannabinoid recruitment and fail to
physiologically adapt to key metabolic challenges.
VMHKO
mice
exhibited
blunted
fasting-induced
feeding and reduced food intake, energy expendi-
ture, and adaptive thermogenesis in response to
cold exposure, high-fat feeding, and dieting (transi-
tion to a low-fat diet). Our findings identify ABHD6
as a regulator of the counter-regulatory responses
to major metabolic shifts, including fasting, nutrient
excess, cold, and dieting, thereby highlighting the
importance of ABHD6 in the VMH in mediating en-
ergy metabolism flexibility.
INTRODUCTION
Metabolic and behavioral processes adjust to changing environ-
mental conditions, including variations in the availability of food
and its composition. This flexible nature of energy metabolism
is fundamental to homeostatic regulation commanded by
hypothalamic nuclei. Consistent with a neuromodulatory role,
endocannabinoids have the capacity to dynamically alter neuro-
transmission in a manner specialized to the neuronal population
affected and are thus well-suited to generating on-demand
metabolic adaptations to changing energy needs. The endocan-
nabinoid system (ECS) plays an important role in hypothalamic
control of energy balance (Busquets-Garcia et al., 2015).
A consequence of increased ECS activity in the hypothalamus
is stimulation of food intake, with concomitant energy sparing.
Themost abundantbrainendocannabinoid,2-arachidonoylgly-
cerol (2-AG), is synthesized postsynaptically upon neuronal acti-
vation and exerts most of its effects by retrograde signaling via
presynaptic CB1 receptors (CB1Rs). The enzymes responsible
for endocannabinoid synthesis and degradation can profoundly
affect the net outcome of ECS activation. 2-AG is classically
described as degraded by monoacyglycerol lipase (MAGL) in
the presynaptic neuron. However, the recently discovered serine
hydrolase a/b-hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6) degrades 2-AG
directly at the site of its synthesis, ultimately affecting 2-AG levels
and action at CB1R (Blankman et al., 2007; Marrs et al., 2010).
Pharmacological inhibition of ABHD6, leading to elevated brain
2-AG levels, is beneficial for autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(Wen et al., 2015) and epilepsy (Naydenov et al., 2014), yet the
contributionof ABHD6 to the central control of energymetabolism
is unknown. Whole-body or peripheral knockout or knockdown of
ABHD6 demonstrates strong therapeutic potential for ABHD6 in-
hibition, with respect to insulin secretion (Zhao et al., 2014, 2015),
as well as insulin sensitivity and obesity (Zhao et al., 2016). These
mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity (Thomas et al., 2013;
Zhao et al., 2016) and exhibit improved glucose tolerance and in-
sulin sensitivity, partly explained via enhanced brown adipose tis-
sue activation and white adipose browning (Zhao et al., 2016).
The ECS plays an important role in the control of feeding and
energy expenditure by the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH)
(Busquets-Garcia et al., 2015). CB1R is strongly expressed in
neurons of the VMH (Marsicano and Lutz, 1999), and deletion
of CB1R in steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) neurons of the VMH in-
creases insulin sensitivity and thermogenesis in chow-fed
mice, yet surprisingly increases susceptibility to diet-induced
obesity in high-fat-fed mice (Cardinal et al., 2014). Despite these
findings, the impact of elevated endogenous levels of 2-AG in the

 VMH and the role of ABHD6 in the control of energy balance is
unknown. To this end, we used a viral strategy to knockout
ABHD6 from VMH neurons of adult mice. ABHD6 deletion in
VMH neurons impairs the counter-regulatory response to key
metabolic challenges, including fasting-induced feeding, diet-
induced obesity, dieting (transition to a low-fat diet), and cold-
induced thermogenesis, thereby highlighting the importance of
ABHD6 in the VMH in adapting to changing energy demands.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Neuronal ABHD6 Loss-of-Function in the VMH
To determine the impact of neuron-specific ABHD6 in the VMH,
a conditional loss-of-function approach was used, whereby
adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) expressing Cre or GFP under
the control of the synapsin promoter were microinjected into
the bilateral VMH of adult ABHD6-floxed mice. AAV injection
location, spread, and neuronal specificity was confirmed by
histology
and
immunohistochemistry
(Figure
1A).
ABHD6
expression in the VMH is comparable to other hypothalamic
nuclei (Figure S1A) and was reduced by an average of 26%
(p < 0.01) in mice receiving AAV-Cre (‘‘VMHKO’’) relative to
controls (‘‘VMHWT’’), whereas it was unchanged in the neigh-
boring lateral hypothalamus (Figure 1B). Cell counts showed
that 84 ± 4% of VMH NeuN-positive cells were GFP positive.
No sign of inflammation or apoptosis was detected in VMH
knockout (VMHKO) versus VMH wild-type (VMHWT) (Figure 1C).
In view of evidence that ABHD6 is also expressed in astrocytes
(Marrs et al., 2010), the relatively modest reduction in ABHD6
mRNA may be largely attributed to the neuronal specificity of
the knockout because NeuN-positive cells represented only
60 ± 4% of all VMH cells.
Disruption of ABHD6 in the VMH Alters Fasting
Refeeding Via Elevated 2-AG
We next sought to determine if ABHD6 loss of function in VMH
neurons alters energy balance under basal conditions in chow-
fed mice. Cumulative food intake was slightly elevated by the
12th week of measurement (+9%, p < 0.05), whereas body
weight and feed efficiency were unchanged (Figures 2A–2C). En-
ergy expenditure (Figures 2D and 2E) and respiratory exchange
ratio (RER) (Figures S2A and S2B) remained similar between
free-feeding VMHKO and VMHWT mice. There was a trend toward
lower movement during the dark phase (p = 0.08) (Figures 2F and
2G), an observation not tied to altered anxiety-like behavior (Fig-
ure S1B). Echo MRI revealed a trend for increased total fat mass
(p = 0.07), with no change in lean mass (Figure S1C). Both sub-
cutaneous inguinal (p = 0.05) and visceral epidydimal (p = 0.08)
fat depot weights were elevated in VMHKO mice (Figure S1D).
Glucose tolerance was unchanged (Figure S2E).
The absence of major differences in food intake (Figure 2A)
is not surprising in light of reports that disruption of CB1R
signaling via pharmacological blockade or gene knockout in-
hibits food intake only in response to fasting (Di Marzo et al.,
2001). Accordingly, we next sought to investigate food intake
following varying fast lengths, ranging from 0 to 18 hr (Figure 2H).
Food intake in response to a 4-hr and 18-hr fast was diminished
in VMHKO mice as compared to VMHWT mice (4-hr fast, �30%,
p < 0.05; 18-hr fast, �25%, p < 0.05). No significant changes
were detected in nonfasted (0 hr) or 2-hr-fasted conditions
(+23%, p = 0.1).
Endocannabinoids are well known to increase food intake, but
this orexigenic effect can be abolished by excess CB1R activa-
tion. Indeed, endocannabinoids exert a biphasic control of food
intake: low-to-moderate doses of 2-AG or the selective CB1R
agonist arachidonyl-2-chloroethylamide increase food intake,
whereas high concentrations can elicit anorectic actions (Belloc-
chio et al., 2010; Koch et al., 2015). Brain endocannabinoid levels
are increased by 30%–100% during fasting (Hanus et al., 2003;
Kirkham et al., 2002) and by 33%–80% with ABHD6 inhibition
(Wen et al., 2015). Therefore, we posited that the blunted fast-
ing-refeeding response we observed in VMHKO mice might result

 from higher than normal VMH ECS activity. To begin testing this
hypothesis, we measured 2-AG content exclusively in the VMH
under fed conditions and following varying degrees of fasting.
Although no difference could be detected between groups under
fed conditions, VMHKO mice showed increased VMH 2-AG
content relative to VMHWT mice after a 4-hr or 18-hr fast
(+50%, p < 0.05, and +54%, p < 0.05, respectively) (Figure 2I).
To further test the hypothesis that elevated levels of 2-AG in
VMHKO mice contributes to the reduced fasting-refeeding

response, we assessed food intake in
response to increasing doses of the
CB1R agonist WIN55-212 (WIN) in 2-hr-

capable of attenuating the fasting-refeed-
ing response (as shown in Figure 2H). As
reported previously (Bellocchio et al.,
2010; Koch et al., 2015), we observed a
biphasic response to CB1R agonism in
VMHWT mice: 0.1- and 0.5-mg/kg doses
of WIN increased food by 25% and 76% (p < 0.05), respectively,
whereas doses higher than 1.0 mg/kg failed to increase food
intake (Figure 2J). In contrast, the dose-response curve shifted
to the left in VMHKO mice, such that a lower dose of WIN
(0.1 mg/kg) elicited the greatest increase in food intake
(+100%) and doses of 0.5 mg/kg and higher had no effect on
feeding, which is reflective of the higher 2-AG content in the
VMH at the time of the injections. Once again, these data sug-
gest that high ECS activity in the VMH, as seen in VMHKO

 mice, can decrease the orexigenic effects of endocannabinoids
in a CB1R-dependent manner. To further support this possibility,
we pharmacologically halted 2-AG synthesis to determine if it
normalizes fasting-refeeding responses between VMHKO and
VMHWT mice. To this end, we infused orlistat, a blocker of
2-AG synthesis (diacylgycerol lipase [DAGL]/pan-lipase inhibi-
tor), into the VMH. In addition, we set out to determine if we
can recapitulate the feeding phenotype of VMHKO mice with in-
jections of an ABHD6 inhibitor (WWL70) into the VMH. As we
found before (Figure 2H), VMHKO animals consumed less food
than VMHWT animals after a 4-hr fast (vehicle injection, �33%,
p < 0.01) (Figure 2K). Inhibiting 2-AG synthesis during the fast
with orlistat inhibited food intake in VMHWT mice, as expected
(�39%, p < 0.01). Moreover, food intake following orlistat treat-
ment was similar between VMHKO and VMHWT, thus blocking
2-AG synthesis normalized food intake between groups. On
the other hand, pharmacological inhibition of ABHD6 in the
VMH of VMHWT mice recapitulated the feeding behavior of
VMHKO mice without affecting feeding in VMHKO mice. This
last experiment suggests that ABHD6 inhibition in neurons
drives the fasting-refeeding phenotype. Collectively, we demon-
strate that increasing 2-AG levels exclusively in the VMH via
neuronal ABHD6 loss of function affects feeding and CB1R
function. Although less likely, these effects could also be
partially mediated via CB2R because both 2-AG and WIN can
bind and activate CB2R. It is, however, still unclear if neurons,
particularly in the hypothalamus, express CB2R. The biphasic
effects of whole-brain CB1R activation on feeding have previ-
ously been linked with striatal CB1R (Bellocchio et al., 2010),
whereas results here suggest that this effect also relies on
the VMH.
Deletion of ABHD6 in the VMH Impairs Cold-Induced
Thermogenesis
Endocannabinoids are well-known to modulate body tempera-
ture (Holtzman et al., 1969), and elevation of whole-brain 2-AG
levels through MAGL inhibition has been shown to elicit a
CB1R-mediated hypothermic response in mice during a cold
challenge (Nass et al., 2015). Moreover, the VMH is implicated
in the regulation of thermogenesis through activation of sympa-
thetic nervous system (SNS) outputs (Kim et al., 2011). Thus, we
next set out to examine the response to acute cold exposure us-
ing internal core temperature probes and indirect calorimetry.
Although energy expenditure and body temperature at 22�C
were similar, VMHKO mice did not adapt to cold as well as
VMHWT mice did when exposed to a temperature of 10�C;
VMHWT mice increased their energy expenditure by 81% versus
65% for VMHKO (p < 0.001 for both) (Figures 3A and 3B). Core
body temperature dropped by 0.86�C for VMHWT and by
1.14�C for VMHKO (p < 0.05) (Figures 3C and 3D). Temperatures
of 4�C differentially increased energy expenditure to 116% of
basal for VMHWT mice, but only to 86% of basal for VMHKO
(p < 0.05), and lowered core body temperature by 1.63�C
for VMHWT and by 2.13�C for VMHKO versus basal (0.69�C
difference; p < 0.01). Reflecting increased use of lipids as
energy substrates, average RER for both VMHWT and VMHKO
mice decreased with temperature (p < 0.05 for both groups at
4�C and 10�C); however, the average RER was significantly
higher in VMHKO at 4�C in comparison with VMHWT (p < 0.01),
which is indicative of reduced lipid oxidation at 4�C (Figures
3E and 3F).
We subsequently exposed a separate cohort of mice to 4�C for
24 hr and examined food intake, plasma lipids, and brown fat
activity markers. Cumulative food intake over 24 hr was reduced
in VMHKO mice (�26%, p < 0.05) (Figure 3G). In line with the
indirect calorimetry data, VMHKO mice had a lower expression
of brown fat UCP1 (�39%, p < 0.01) and PGC1-a (�47%,
p < 0.01) and reduced plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs)
(�33%, p < 0.05) (Figures 3H and 3I). These results suggest that
VMH ABHD6 contributes to the counter-regulatory response to
cold exposure, likely via an endocannabinoid-dependent mech-
anism that regulates food intake, lipid mobilization, and brown
fat thermogenesis. Based on these findings and the role of
ECS in thermoregulation via sympathetic outputs, the phenotype
of cold-exposed VMHKO mice is likely due to increased VMH
ECS activity and reduced SNS outflow.
VMHKO Mice Exhibit Reduced Adaptive Thermogenesis
and Are Prone to Diet-Induced Obesity
Hypothalamic 2-AG content doubles when mice are placed on a
high-fat (HF) diet for more than 2 weeks (Higuchi et al., 2012).
This rise in hypothalamic 2-AG is believed to play a role in
the development of obesity because it reduces energy expendi-
ture, adaptive thermogenesis, and adipose tissue lipolysis via
decreased sympathetic tone (Quarta et al., 2010). Given our ob-
servations that ABHD6 disruption in the VMH alters endocanna-
binoid-driven processes, we put mice on an HF diet. In spite of a
similar food intake, VMHKO mice were significantly heavier at the
end of the 12-week protocol (+24%, p < 0.01) (Figures 4A and
4B). Feed efficiency was increased in VMHKO mice (p < 0.01)
(Figure 4C). Although there was no change in lean mass, fat
mass was increased in VMHKO mice (+16%, p < 0.05) (Figure 4D).
More specifically, the subcutaneous inguinal fat depot was
significantly heavier in VMHKO animals (+34%, p < 0.05),
whereas no significant change was detected in the epidydimal
fat depot (Figure 4E). Interscapular brown fat mass of VMHKO
mice was lighter than that of VMHWT mice (�23%, p < 0.05) (Fig-
ure 4F). Glucose tolerance was similar between the groups
(Figure S2F).
A switch from chow to HF feeding triggers a net increase in en-
ergy expenditure, an energy ‘‘wasting’’ homeostatic process
referred to as adaptive thermogenesis. We found that after
12 weeks of HF diet, VMHKO mice have reduced energy expen-
diture (normalized to metabolic mass) compared to VMHWT mice
during both the dark (�16%, p < 0.05) and light phases (�22%,
p < 0.01) (Figures 4G and 4H). Compared to their chow-fed coun-
terparts, VMHWT mice on an HF diet showed a 40% increase in
dark cycle energy expenditure, whereas VMHKO mice exhibited
a 21% increase (Figure 4I). No change was seen in RER (Figures
S2C and S2D). Ambulatory activity of HF-fed VMHKO was
strongly reduced versus VMHWT during the dark phase (�46%,
p < 0.05) (Figures 4J and 4K). Although diminished locomotion
could partly account for the reduced energy expenditure
measured in the dark phase, no change in ambulatory activity
was observed during the light phase, whereas energy expendi-
ture remained lower. These results suggest that decreased

 locomotion is not the principle contributor to the reduced energy
expenditure of knockout mice, but rather that these changes
stem from a suppression in adaptive thermogenesis that is
driven via sympathetic output.
Based on ABHD6 expression in the arcuate nucleus (ARC)
(Figure S1A), a nucleus neighboring the VMH and playing a key
role in energy balance, we tested if ARC ABHD6 influences
diet-induced obesity (DIO) using a similar Cre-viral approach.
The disruption of ABHD6 in ARC neurons did not affect food
intake, body weight, energy expenditure, and locomotor activity
in animals fed with chow or a high-fat diet (Figures S3A–S3H). In
contrast to the VMH, ABHD6 disruption in the ARC did not alter
the susceptibility to DIO and thus supports the specificity of our
VMHKO model.
Resistance to Diet-Induced Weight Loss in VMHKO Mice
The maladaptive thermogenic response of VMHKO mice to an HF
diet enhances sensitivity to diet-induced obesity. To further eval-
uate the capacity to adapt to changing energy demands, a new
cohort of VMHKO and VMHWT mice was transitioned (D0) to chow
after a 12-week HF regimen. We followed body weight, energy
expenditure, RER, ambulatory activity, and food intake for their
last 7 days on an HF diet (D-7 to D0) and the following 35 days
on chow (D0 to D+35), as schematized in Figure 5A. From D-7
to D+35, VMHWT mice lost an average of 2.9 g (6% of their
body weight) during the first 14 days of diet transition, and
then their body weights started to plateau (Figures 5B–5D).
VMHKO mice, on the other hand, lost an average of 0.4 g
(< 1% of their body weight) (p < 0.01). While on HF diet, VMHWT

 mice at D-7 had a higher energy expenditure than VMHKO mice
did (Figure 5C), reproducing the results previously obtained in
Figure 3H. They showed a decrease of energy expenditure
from D-7 to D+32 (�13%), mostly after D+7, and thereby de-
fended body weight in response to transition to chow (Figures

throughout D-7 to D+35. Energy expenditure variation from

ference between the groups in ambulatory activity did not vary
over time and thus should not explain the changes in energy
expenditure between VMHKO and VMHWT mice. Expectedly,

 the average RER for both groups increased following the diet
transition, which is representative of reduced lipid utilization,
and there were no differences between the groups (Figure 5G).
Although cumulative food intake for the HF feeding period was
similar between the two groups, VMHKO mice consumed more
food than controls did toward the end of the chow-feeding pro-
tocol (D+35, +15%, p < 0.01), contributing to the absence of
weight loss (Figure 5H).
By simultaneously inspecting food intake, body weight, and
calorimetric data at specific time points during the diet transition
study, we can infer that most of the weight loss achieved by
VMHWT mice occurred at the beginning of diet transition, during
a period in which adaptive thermogenesis is still considerably
active. The absence of weight loss immediately following transi-
tion to chow in VMHKO mice is thus explained via the lack of
adaptive thermogenesis, as we have documented. Together
with the HF-feeding study, these results imply that the disruption
of ABHD6 in neurons of the VMH dampens the ability of mice
to adapt energy homeostasis (food intake and energy expendi-
ture) according to diet composition, increasing their susceptibil-
ity to diet-induced obesity and resistance to dieting-induced
weight loss.
Conclusion
Energy metabolism is transformative to environmental condi-
tions. This flexible nature of metabolism is largely adaptive for
the organism. The leading exception is humans with access to
plenty of food and little necessity to engage in physical activity
to procure food, for which metabolism can be problematically
inflexible to a shifting diet and exercise lifestyle (e.g., resting en-
ergy expenditure; Fothergill et al., 2016). The capacity of endo-
cannabinoids to actively fine tune neuronal activity is well-suited
to the central mechanisms underlying adjustments of energy
metabolism. In this study, we demonstrate that increasing
intrinsic 2-AG levels in the VMH by removing the lipase respon-
sible for its postsynaptic degradation significantly blunts the
counter-regulatory response to fasting, cold exposure, nutrient
excess, and dieting.
In conditions of freely available chow and ambient tempera-
tures, the absence of ABHD6 in neurons of the VMH had little ef-
fect on energy balance; however, metabolic challenges that
potentiate 2-AG accumulation hindered homeostatic responses.
In agreement with the demonstration that ABHD6 regulates stim-
ulus-dependent accumulation of 2-AG in primary neurons and
that ABHD6 contribution to total 2-AG degradation is relatively
modest under basal conditions (Marrs et al., 2010), our finding
that VMH 2-AG levels were unchanged in fed conditions, while
elevated in knockout mice following fasting, is not surprising.
Collectively, our results suggest that ABHD6 is a regulatory
gatekeeper of 2-AG pools in the face of challenges that stimulate
the ECS. Whether or not the effects of VMH ABHD6 neuronal
deletion and high 2-AG levels are mediated in part by CB1R
desensitization or alternate mechanisms is unknown. Of note,
mice deficient for CB1R in glutamatergic neurons of the brain,
which define the vast majority of VMH neurons (Ziegler et al.,
2002), are also hypophagic only after food deprivation (Belloc-
chio et al., 2010). In addition, CB1R deletion in SF1-positive
VMH neurons or throughout the whole hypothalamus regulates
‘‘metabolic flexibility’’ by hindering energy expenditure upon
transition to a high-fat diet (Cardinal et al., 2014).
ABHD6 loss of function in the whole body or in peripheral
metabolic tissues has recently been noted for having protective
actions against DIO (Thomas et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2016).
Contributing to a catabolic phenotype, pan-ABHD6 knockout
mice exhibit a greater energy expenditure, which is proposed
to be due to direct actions of ABHD6 in brown adipose tissue
(Zhao et al., 2016). It is clear that removal of ABHD6 function in
the VMH has different actions that are in line with the function
of this nucleus. By showing that absence of ABHD6 in VMH neu-
rons attenuates adaptive thermogenesis, our findings provide
mechanistic insights on SNS-dependent regulation of thermo-
genesis by 2-AG accumulation in the VMH. Because these
results highlight VMH neuronal ABHD6 and 2-AG as a major in-
fluence on energy metabolism flexibility, they suggest exploring
ways to target the endocannabinoid system in the VMH as a
therapeutic means to alter energy metabolism.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
All protocols were approved by the CRCHUM animal care committee and were
conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on
Animal Care. Our group generated ABHD6lox/lox mice (backcrossed to
C57BL/6N), as previously described (Zhao et al., 2014). Male mice were indi-
vidually housed under a reverse cycle in environmentally controlled rooms
(22�C–24�C), with ad libitum access to food. All testing and sacrifices were
carried out during the dark phase. All mice were sacrificed under isoflurane
anesthesia, and brain, plasma, brown, and white adipose tissue depots
were harvested and frozen.
In Vivo Metabolic Assessments
Mice were fed standard chow or an HF diet (modified AIN-93G purified rodent
diet with 50% kcal from fat derived from palm oil; Hryhorczuk et al., 2016).
Body weight and food intake were measured twice weekly. Lean and fat
mass were assessed by nuclear echo MRI. Oxygen consumption (VO2), car-
bon dioxide production (VCO2) for indirect calorimetry, and ambulatory move-
ment were measured after a 24-hr habituation period in a Comprehensive Lab
Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS) at 22�C (Colombus Instruments). For
cold-exposure studies, sterile temperature probes (G2 HR E-mitter, Bio-
Lynx) were implanted intraperitoneally (i.p.) 2 weeks prior to the experiment.
After complete recovery, core body temperature was recorded using indirect
calorimetry, in addition to the other parameters, for a period of 96 hr under
different temperature settings (24-hr habituation at 22�C, 24 hr at 10�C,
24 hr at 4�C, and 24 hr at 22�C). Energy expenditure was calculated by multi-
plying the VO2 value by (3.815 + 1.232 3 VCO2/VO2), and corrected by meta-
bolic mass (lean mass + 0.2 fat mass; Even and Nadkarni, 2012) when echo
MRI data were available.
Feeding Experiments
Mice were habituated to handling. For fasting-refeeding studies, mice were
fasted for 0, 2, or 4 hr (starting 1 hr before the onset of the dark phase) or
18 hr. Food intake was measured at the beginning of the dark cycle for 2 hr.
When indicated, the CB1R agonist WIN55-212 or vehicle was injected i.p. right
before refeeding. For WWL70 and orlistat (pan-lipase inhibitor) studies, ani-
mals were fasted for 4 hr (starting 1 hr before the onset of the dark phase).
One hr later, animals received intra-VMH infusion of orlistat (1.25 mg),
WWL70 (1.0 mg), or vehicle in 500 nL. Food pellets were put in the cages
3 hr later, and 1-hr food intake was measured. Each feeding experiment
was performed using a within-subject design, in which all animals received
the treatments and corresponding vehicle in a counterbalanced order,
with at least 1 week of recovery in between the experiments. Food intake for
1224

 fasting-refeeding experiments was corrected by body weight and normalized
to average VMHWT consumption on control treatment.
Statistical Analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. Groups were compared using one-
way or two-way ANOVA, with Bonferroni post hoc tests, t tests, or linear
regression, as indicated using Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad). Statistical sig-
nificance was set as p < 0.05, where *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.
