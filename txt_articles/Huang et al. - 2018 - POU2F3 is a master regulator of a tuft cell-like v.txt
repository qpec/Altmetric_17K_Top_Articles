Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is widely considered to be a tumor of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells; however, a
variant form of this disease has been described that lacks neuroendocrine features. Here, we applied domain-focused
CRISPR screening to human cancer cell lines to identify the transcription factor (TF) POU2F3 (POU class
2 homeobox 3; also known as SKN-1a/OCT-11) as a powerful dependency in a subset of SCLC lines. An analysis of
human SCLC specimens revealed that POU2F3 is expressed exclusively in variant SCLC tumors that lack expres-
sion of neuroendocrine markers and instead express markers of a chemosensory lineage known as tuft cells. Using
chromatin- and RNA-profiling experiments, we provide evidence that POU2F3 is a master regulator of tuft cell
identity in a variant form of SCLC. Moreover, we show that most SCLC tumors can be classified into one of three
lineages based on the expression of POU2F3, ASCL1, or NEUROD1. Our CRISPR screens exposed other unique
dependencies in POU2F3-expressing SCLC lines, including the lineage TFs SOX9 and ASCL2 and the receptor
tyrosine kinase IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor). These data reveal POU2F3 as a cell identity deter-
minant and a dependency in a tuft cell-like variant of SCLC, which may reflect a previously unrecognized cell of
origin or a trans-differentiation event in this disease.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is associated with rapid
cell growth, early metastatic spread, and a complete lack
of target-based therapies (Semenova et al. 2015). Conse-
quently, the current treatment of SCLC with chemother-
apy, radiotherapy, and surgery is associated with a dismal
5-yr survival rate of 6%. Comprehensive genome sequenc-
ing of SCLC tumors has revealed a high mutational load in
this disease, with most tumors possessing inactivating
mutations or deletions of the tumor suppressors RB1
and TP53 but few actionable oncogene targets (George
et al. 2015). Thus, a much-needed personalized medicine
paradigm has yet to be implemented in this disease.
Experiments in genetically engineered mice suggest a
pulmonary neuroendocrine cell of origin for SCLC (Seme-
nova et al. 2015), which is supported by the expression of
neuroendocrine differentiation markers chromogranin A
(CHGA) and insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) in
human SCLC tumors (Gazdar et al. 2017). In addition,
the neuroendocrine lineage master regulator ASCL1 is ex-
pressed and essential in SCLC tumors and cell lines
(Augustyn et al. 2014; Borromeo et al. 2016).
However, it has long been recognized that a subset of
SCLC cell lines exhibits a “variant” phenotype associated
with low expression of neuroendocrine markers (Gazdar
et al. 1985). A recent transcriptome analysis of human
SCLC tumors revealed that ∼20% of samples expressed
low
levels
of
neuroendocrine
markers
CHGA
and
ASCL1 but still possessed the cell morphology and genet-
ic profile of SCLC (George et al. 2015). The molecular
basis of this variable neuroendocrine differentiation is
not well understood. Studies in cell lines and mice suggest
that the neurogenic transcription factor (TF) NEUROD1
can function as an alternative master regulator to ASCL1
in neurodendocrinelow SCLC (Borromeo et al. 2016; Mol-
laoglu et al. 2017). Elevated expression of MYC and
REST as well as activation of NOTCH signaling are also

 known to inhibit neuroendocrine differentiation in SCLC
(Lim et al. 2017; Mollaoglu et al. 2017). Nevertheless, the
biological and clinical significance of variable neuroendo-
crine differentiation in SCLC remains unclear.
POU2F3 (POU class 2 homeobox 3; also known as
SKN-1a/OCT-11) is a TF required for the generation of a
rare chemosensory cell type found in the gastrointestinal
and respiratory tracts (Matsumoto et al. 2011; Yamaguchi
et al. 2014; Gerbe et al. 2016; Yamashita et al. 2017).
These cells are known by a variety of names (including
tuft, brush, microvillous, caveolated, or multivesicular
cells), but, for simplicity, we refer to POU2F3-expressing
chemosensory cells as a “tuft cell” lineage throughout
this study. Like neuroendocrine cells, tuft cells respond
to external stimuli by releasing bioactive substances to
regulate local epithelial and immune cell functions
(Howitt et al. 2016; von Moltke et al. 2016). Despite their
similar functions and anatomical locations, tuft cells are
distinct from the neuroendocrine cell lineage (Kaske
et al. 2007). In addition to POU2F3, recent studies have ex-
posed a variety of tuft cell lineage markers, including the
TFs SOX9, GFI1B, and ASCL2; the ion channel TRPM5;
the villin family protein AVIL; and choline O-acetyltrans-
ferase (CHAT) (Kaske et al. 2007; Bezencon et al. 2008;
Bjerknes et al. 2012; Yamaguchi et al. 2014; Gerbe et al.
2016; Haber et al. 2017; Yan et al. 2017). Notably, an ab-
sence of tuft-like cells is the only known abnormality in
Pou2f3-deficient mice (Andersen et al. 1997; Matsumoto
et al. 2011; Yamaguchi et al. 2014; Gerbe et al. 2016). In
this study we identify a link between the tuft cell lineage
master regulator POU2F3 and the variant subtype of
SCLC.

CRISPR screen identifies POU2F3 as an essential TF
in a subset of SCLC cell lines
We recently described domain-focused CRISPR screening
as a strategy to identify essential transcriptional regula-
tors in cancer (Shi et al. 2015). In this study, we applied
this method to identify novel TF dependencies exhibiting
exceptional potency and specificity for SCLC. To this end,
we constructed a pooled library of 8658 single guide RNAs
(sgRNAs) targeting 1427 DNA-binding domains of human
TFs. We transduced this library via lentivirus into 19
heterologous Cas9-expressing cancer cell lines, including
sevenSCLC lines, and performednegativeselection“drop-
out” screens (Supplemental Fig. S1). Importantly, we were
unable to establish CRISPR screening in any neuroendo-
crinehigh/ASCL1high SCLC lines, which grew poorly in
the presence of Cas9 (data not shown). Hence, our screen-
ing strategy was unintentionally biased toward identifying
essential TFs in the neuroendocrinelow variant form of
SCLC.
We performed deep sequencing analysis to quantify
sgRNA abundance at an initial time point (3 d after infec-
tion with the library) and after 14 population doublings of
each cell line. The log2 fold change of each sgRNA (averag-
ing the effects of independent sgRNAs targeting each TF)
was used to nominate essential TFs. While all 19 cell lines
share a dependence on certain TFs (e.g., MAX, CTCF, and
YY1), a subset of TFs was selectively essential in SCLC
(Fig. 1A; Supplemental Table 1). This included SOX4,
NEUROD1, E2F3, and OTX2, all of which have been im-
plicated previously in SCLC (Cooper et al. 2006; Parisi
et al. 2007; Castillo et al. 2012; Osborne et al. 2013; Chris-
tensen et al. 2014). Our screens identified POU2F3 as the
second-ranked SCLC-specific TF dependency (Fig. 1A).
POU2F3 was essential in only three SCLC lines (NCI-
H211, NCI-H526, and NCI-H1048) but was dispensable
in the other 16 cancer lines that we screened (Fig. 1A). In
addition to its striking selectivity, POU2F3 was a potent
dependency in each of these SCLC lines (Fig. 1B; Sup-
plemental Fig. S2). We confirmed the pattern of POU2F3
dependence using competition-based assays of individual
sgRNAs (Fig. 1C). To our knowledge, no prior study has
demonstrated a role for POU2F3 as a cancer dependency,
which prompted us to investigate its role in SCLC.
By Western blotting and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
analysis, we found that POU2F3 expression was limited
to the subset of SCLC lines in which it was required for
growth (Fig. 1D). Using the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia
(Barretina et al. 2012), we identified a fourth POU2F3high
SCLC line (COR-L311), which we found also depends on
POU2F3 to proliferate (Fig. 1C,D). An RNA fluorescent
in
situ
hybridization
(FISH)
analysis
revealed
that
POU2F3 was expressed from both alleles in SCLC lines,
suggesting that its expression is not driven by a cis-acting
genetic alteration (Supplemental Fig. S3). We confirmed
the on-target effects of POU2F3 sgRNAs via Western blot-
ting and by cloning a CRISPR-resistant POU2F3 cDNA,
which was able to rescue the growth arrest phenotype
cause by a POU2F3 sgRNA (Fig. 1E,F). To rule out artifacts
of using the CRISPR system, we also confirmed the
POU2F3 dependency using shRNA-based knockdown
(Supplemental Fig. S4). Taken together, these results val-
idate that POU2F3 is essential in the subset of SCLC lines
that express this TF at high levels.
POU2F3 is expressed in a variant form of SCLC
that resembles the tuft cell lineage
We next evaluated the pattern of POU2F3 expression in
human SCLC tumor samples. First, we performed immu-
nohistochemical staining of POU2F3 using tissue micro-
arrays of 204 SCLC samples, which revealed POU2F3
expression in 25 tumors (∼12%) (Fig. 2A). Using hematox-
ylin and eosin (H&E) staining, we observed that POU2-
F3low
and
POU2F3high
samples
each
possessed
the
characteristic “oat cell” morphology that defines SCLC
(Fig. 2A). To further validate the heterogeneous pattern
of POU2F3 expression in SCLC, we analyzed two pub-
lished transcriptome data sets obtained from human
SCLC samples (Sato et al. 2013; George et al. 2015). In ac-
cord with our immunohistochemical analysis, POU2F3
was expressed at high levels in ∼18% of cases across these
two studies: in 11 out of 79 samples in the George et al.
(2015) data set and in seven out of 23 samples of the
Sato et al. (2013) data set (Fig. 2B; Supplemental Fig. S5).

 These results confirm that POU2F3 is highly expressed in
a subset of histologically confirmed SCLC.
We next considered whether POU2F3 expression in
SCLC tumors was associated with unique clinical, genet-
ic, or molecular characteristics. In the cohort of 79 SCLC
tumors analyzed by George et al. (2015), POU2F3 expres-
sion was not associated with a significant difference in
overall survival (Supplemental Fig. S6). We also did not ob-
serve striking differences in the pattern of gene mutations
in these two groups of patients (Supplemental Fig. S7).
This led us to consider instead whether POU2F3 expres-
sion correlates with a unique gene expression profile in
SCLC. It was shown previously that SCLC tumors can
be classified into two major subgroups when performing
an unsupervised clustering analysis of transcriptome
data (George et al. 2015). The larger subgroup (group 2)
is associated with high expression of the neuroendocrine
markers CHGA and ASCL1, whereas the smaller sub-
group (group 1) is characterized by low neuroendocrine
marker expression (George et al. 2015). We reconstructed
this clustering analysis from the investigators’ data set
and evaluated POU2F3 expression within these two
groups of samples (Fig. 2B). Remarkably, we found that
POU2F3 expression was exclusive to group 1 tumors
with low neuroendocrine marker expression (Fig. 2B).
We applied this same clustering analysis to the microarray
data produced by Sato et al. (2013) and confirmed the ex-
clusive expression of POU2F3 to group 1 samples in this
independent cohort (Supplemental Fig. S5).
The essentiality of POU2F3 and its association with a
distinct transcriptional signature suggested that this TF
might function as a master regulator that specifies cell
identity in a subtype of SCLC. To investigate this, we con-
structed a “group 1 identity signature” and a “group 2
identity signature” by selecting ∼200 genes that were pref-
erentially expressed in each set of tumor samples (Supple-
mental Fig. S8). Importantly, the group 1 identity genes
were more highly expressed in POU2F3high SCLC cell
lines, and the group 2 identity genes were expressed at
higher levels in ASCL1high lines (Supplemental Fig. S8).
This shows that SCLC lines retain the cell identity profile
found in primary human tumors. We next performed
RNA-seq analysis after POU2F3 or control sgRNA trans-
duction in each of the four POU2F3high cell lines, which
revealed that inactivating POU2F3 led to a global reduc-
tion in the expression of group 1 identity genes (Fig. 2C)
and no significant effect on group 2 identity genes (data
not shown). These findings suggest that POU2F3 specifies
cell identity in the neuroendocrinelow subtype of SCLC in
addition to its role as a dependency.
We next evaluated the expression of marker genes to
clarify the lineage profile of POU2F3high SCLC. We began
by examining neuroendocrine lineage markers INSM1,
CHGA, GRP (gastrin-releasing peptide), and CALCA (cal-
citonin-related polypeptide) (Taneja and Sharma 2004;
Gazdar et al. 2017). As expected, these genes were not ex-
pressed in POU2F3high tumors (Fig. 2D). The neuroendo-
crine lineage master regulator ASCL1 was similarly
lacking in POU2F3high tumors (Fig. 2D). We then assessed
the expression of TFs that had been linked previously with
variant SCLC and found that POU2F3high tumors ex-
pressed higher levels of REST and MYC but lacked expres-
sion of NEUROD1 (Fig. 2E).
Recent studies have shown that POU2F3 functions as a
master regulator of the tuft cell lineage (Gerbe et al. 2016;
Yamashita et al. 2017). We therefore sought to determine
whether POU2F3 drives the expression of tuft cell mark-
ers in this variant of SCLC. Remarkably, we found that
several tuft cell markers were up-regulated in POU2F3high
tumors, including TRPM5, SOX9, GFI1B, CHAT, ASCL2,
and AVIL (Fig. 2F). We validated this overall pattern of
marker gene expression in an independent SCLC tran-
scriptome data set (Sato et al. 2013) and in our own
RNA-seq analysis of human SCLC cell lines (Supplemen-
tal Figs. S9, S10). Of note, our TF CRISPR screens also
identified SOX9 and ASCL2 as intermediate dependencies
in POU2F3high cell lines (Fig. 1B), which we confirmed in
competition-based assays of individual sgRNAs (Supple-
mental Fig. S11). Furthermore, inactivating POU2F3 led
to diminished expression of several tuft cell marker genes
in SCLC lines (Supplemental Fig. S12). Taken together,
these findings suggest that POU2F3 specifies a tuft cell-
like identity in a variant form of SCLC.
Enhancer landscapes classify SCLC lines based
on POU2F3, ASCL1, or NEUROD1 expression
A
prior
study
demonstrated
that
ASCL1high
and
NEUROD1high human SCLC lines harbor striking differ-
ences in their enhancer landscapes, suggesting that these
two master regulators specify distinct chromatin states
and lineage identities (Borromeo et al. 2016). This prompt-
ed us to consider whether POU2F3high cell lines possess a
unique enhancer profile that differs from these two other
SCLC subtypes. To investigate this, we performed chro-
matin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by DNA
sequencing (ChIP-seq) to profile histone H3K27 acetyla-
tion (H3K27ac) in SCLC lines. H3K27ac is enriched at ac-
tive enhancers and promoter elements and is a validated
mark for annotating such elements in a nonbiased manner
(Rada-Iglesias et al. 2011). We chose 14 SCLC lines for our
analysis: Four cell lines express POU2F3, three express
NEUROD1, six express ASCL1, and one lacks all three
TFs (Supplemental Fig. S10). We note that in both SCLC
tumor samples and cell lines, these three TFs are ex-
pressed in a mutually exclusive manner (Fig. 2B; Supple-
mental Figs. S5, S9, S10, S13).
An unsupervised clustering analysis of the global
H3K27ac enrichment pattern across these lines revealed
three major groupings that corresponded to the expression
of POU2F3, NEUROD1, or ASCL1 (Fig. 3A). One excep-
tion was the DMS114 line, which does not express any
of these three TFs yet clustered with the POU2F3high lines
(Fig. 3A). We extracted the subset of H3K27ac-enriched re-
gions that correlated with expression of each of the three
TFs, which we termed P, N, or A elements based on en-
richment of H3K27ac in cell lines that express POU2F3,
NEUROD1, or ASCL1, respectively (Fig. 3B). As expected,
POU2F3, NEUROD1, and ASCL1 motifs were highly en-
riched at P, N, or A elements, respectively (Supplemental

 unique chromatin landscape linked to POU2F3, which
further implicates this TF as an alternative master regula-
tor to ASCL1 and NEUROD1 in SCLC.
POU2F3 establishes active enhancers at tuft cell identity
genes in SCLC
We further characterized P elements as putative enhancer
elements activated by POU2F3. The overwhelming ma-
jority of P elements was located in either intergenic or
intronic regions, consistent with being distal enhancers
(Supplemental Fig. S16). Our RNA-seq analysis revealed
that genes located in the vicinity of P elements were sup-
pressed upon inactivating POU2F3 in each of the four
SCLC lines (Fig. 3D; Supplemental Fig. S17). We next per-
formed H3K27ac ChIP-seq in NCI-H1048 cells after trans-
duction with POU2F3 or control sgRNAs. Importantly,
inactivating POU2F3 led to a loss of H3K27ac at P ele-
ments while having minimal effects on the global profile
of H3K27ac in the cell (Fig. 3E). As examples, POU2F3 ac-
tivates enhancers located near tuft cell marker genes
GFI1B, CHAT, ASCL2, and AVIL (Fig. 3F). Taken togeth-
er, these findings suggest that POU2F3 activates a set of
enhancers to promote expression of tuft cell lineage genes
in variant SCLC.
Kinase domain-focused CRISPR screening identifies an
essential role for insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor
(IGF1R) in POU2F3high SCLC
The practical utility of identifying novel subtypes of
SCLC is in the potential to uncover an association with
actionable dependencies. To investigate this possibility,
we performed a CRISPR screen that compared the essen-
tiality of 493 kinase domains in the POU2F3high line
NCI-H526 with the NEUROD1high line NCI-H82 (Supple-
mental Table 6). While nearly all essential kinases were
shared between these two cell lines, the IGF1R was iden-
tified as a unique dependency in NCI-H526 cells (Fig. 4A).
By Western blotting, we confirmed that IGF1R sgRNAs
led to depletion of IGF1R protein in both cell line contexts
(Fig. 4B). A broader validation of this result in competi-
tion-based assays identified IGF1R dependence in three
of the four POU2F3high lines but no growth arrest pheno-
type in the four SCLC lines that lacked POU2F3 expres-
sion (Fig. 4C). Of note, the POU2F3high SCLC line that
grew independently of IGF1R (NCI-H1048) expressed
IGF1R at low levels and had an activating mutation of
PIK3CA (H1047R) (Supplemental Fig. S18; Bader et al.
2006; Barretina et al. 2012), which may bypass upstream
receptor tyrosine kinases (Nisa et al. 2017). We next eval-
uated the sensitivity of 14 SCLC lines to linsitinib, a small
molecule inhibitor of IGF1R kinase activity (Mulvihill
et al. 2009). Using a compound titration and cell prolifer-
ation measurements, we observed that POU2F3high lines
were consistently more sensitive to linsitinib than NEU-
ROD1high or ASCL1high SCLC lines (Fig. 4D).
In human tumor transcriptome data (Sato et al. 2013;
George et al. 2015), we found a modest elevation of
IGF1R in POU2F3high relative to POU2F3low SCLC sam-
ples (Fig. 4E,F). However, IGF1R expression across the
SCLC lines was not well correlated with IGF1R depen-
dence (Supplemental Fig. S18), consistent with prior find-
ings (Zinn et al. 2013). In addition, inactivating POU2F3
did not influence IGF1R expression (Supplemental Fig.
S19). This prompted us to evaluate the expression of other
IGF1R pathway components in SCLC. We found that
IGFBP5, a negative regulator of IGF1R signaling (Ding
et al. 2016), was expressed at low levels in POU2F3high pa-
tient samples and cell lines (Fig. 4E,F), and CRISPR-based
targeting of POU2F3 in SCLC cell lines led to a marked in-
crease in IGFPB5 expression (Fig. 4H). Furthermore,
forced IGFBP5 expression via lentivirus in POU2F3high
SCLC lines inhibited cell proliferation, while introduc-
ing IGFBP5 into ASCL1high cell lines had no effect (Fig.
4I). Taken together, these findings suggest that expression
of IGF1R pathway genes and dependence on IGF1R differ
between the POU2F3high and POU2F3low subtypes of
SCLC.
Rare POU2F3-expressing cells are present in the mouse
bronchial epithelium
POU2F3-expressing tuft cells have been found previously
in the mouse trachea (Yamashita et al. 2017), but their
presence in the lung has not been demonstrated previous-
ly. To examine this, we performed immunofluorescence
staining for POU2F3 in cross-sections of the mouse
lung, which revealed rare POU2F3-expressing cells in
the epithelial layer surrounding the primary/secondary
bronchi but no detectable POU2F3 expression in the distal
airways or alveoli (Fig. 5A–G; Supplemental Figs. S20,
S21; data not shown). POU2F3-expressing cells lacked ex-
pression of the neuroendocrine cell marker CGRP, the cil-
iated cell marker acetylated α-tubulin, and the club cell
marker CC10 (Fig. 5A–F; Supplemental Figs. S20, S21).
We note that SCLC often presents as a mass in central air-
way locations, which is similar to the site in which we de-
tected POU2F3 expression.
Discussion
Our findings lead us to propose that POU2F3 is an essen-
tial master regulator of cell identity in the neuroendocri-
nelow variant of SCLC. One important line of evidence
in support of this conclusion is that POU2F3high SCLC tu-
mors and cell lines lack the expression of classical neuro-
endocrine lineage markers and instead express markers of
the tuft cell lineage. In addition, our epigenomic analysis
shows that POU2F3 establishes active enhancers at tuft
cell identity genes in SCLC. The shared POU2F3 require-
ment in the normal tuft cell lineage and in the tuft cell-
like variant of SCLC suggests a similar master regulator
function for POU2F3 in normal and malignant contexts.
Finally, we identify transcriptional and signaling depen-
dencies that are linked to POU2F3 expression in SCLC.
Together,
these
findings
support
consideration
of
POU2F3high SCLC as a disease entity that is distinct from
the classical neuroendocrine form of this disease.

 A key unanswered question in our study relates to the
origin of POU2F3 expression in SCLC. We observed rare
POU2F3-expressing cells in the epithelial layer of the pri-
mary and secondary bronchi, which is a common location
for SCLC tumors to arise in humans. This raises a possibil-
ity that a POU2F3-expressing tuft cell is a cell of origin in a
subset of SCLC cases, which will be evaluated in future
studies by engineering Trp53 and Rb1 mutations in this
cell population in mice. However, cell identity in lung
cancer is known to be plastic, particularly for tumors un-
der the selection pressure of therapy (Sequist et al. 2011).
While POU2F3high tumors identified in the George et al.
(2015) cohort were largely collected from SCLC patients
before treatment, it is possible that POU2F3 expression
was acquired during tumor evolution through a trans-dif-
ferentiation mechanism or as a consequence of a yet to be
identified genetic alteration. However, the biallelic ex-
pression pattern of POU2F3 in SCLC lines suggests that
a cis-acting mutation at the POU2F3 locus is unlikely to
be the source of its expression. It also remains unclear at
present whether POU2F3high tumor cells can transition
to a NEUROD1high or ASCL1high cell state (or vice versa)
as an adaptive response to a selection pressure. In addi-
tion, the role of MYC overexpression in the POU2F3high
variant of SCLC awaits further investigation. While
POU2F3 and NEUROD1 expression accounts for the ma-
jority neuroendocrinelow variant SCLC tumors, we note
that a small number of variant tumors lack expression of
both TFs. This suggests that additional mechanisms await
characterization within the variant form of this disease.
The current management of SCLC with chemotherapy
leads to short-lived responses, and the prognosis of this
disease has not changed over several decades. To improve
outcomes for SCLC patients, substantial efforts have been
made to evaluate targeted agents in the clinic, but with
limited success (Joshi et al. 2013). However, these trials
have been conducted largely in unselected SCLC patient
populations. For example, a prior study demonstrated
that a subset of SCLC lines is sensitive to linsitinib
(Zinn et al. 2013), yet this drug failed to demonstrate
efficacy in unselected SCLC patients in a phase II
study (Chiappori et al. 2016). Our findings justify a

er exceptional responses are associated with the expres-

lineage-defining
master
regulators
POU2F3,
ASCL1, or NEUROD1. Such efforts might allow for the
design of biomarker-driven clinical studies and the ad-
vancement of a personalized medicine strategy for this
disease.
Finally, it has been shown that Pou2f3-null mice have a
normal life span and only discrete chemosensory deficits
due to the absence of the tuft cell lineage (Andersen
et al. 1997; Gerbe et al. 2016; Yamashita et al. 2017).
Hence, a therapeutic strategy aimed at blockade of
POU2F3 function or ablation of the tuft cell lineage would
be expected to have a wide therapeutic margin in patients
with POU2F3high SCLC tumors. Chemical degradation
approaches and targeting of transcriptional coactivator
complexes are strategies for interfering with TFs in cancer
(Bhagwat and Vakoc 2015). Thus, a deeper biochemical
understanding of POU2F3 and its cofactors may expose
strategies for targeting this dependency as a therapeutic
approach in SCLC.
Materials and methods
Cell lines
All cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collec-
tion or Sigma. SCLC cell lines COR-L311, NCI-H211, NCI-H526,
DMS114, NCI-H446, NCI-H82, NCI-H524, NCI-H889, DMS79,
NCI-H146, and NCI-H69; leukemia cell lines MOLM-13, MV4-
11, NOMO-1, HEL, and K562; and pancreatic cancer cell lines
SUIT-2 and MIAPaca-2 were cultured in RPMI supplemented
with 10% FBS. NCI-H510A was cultured in F12K supplemented
with 10% FBS. NCI-H1048 was cultured in DMEM:F12 sup-
plemented with 0.005 mg/mL insulin, 0.01 mg/mL transferrin,
30 nM sodium selenite, 10 nM hydrocortisone, 10 nM β-estradiol,
4.5 mM L-glutamine, and 5% FBS. NCI-H128 cells were cultured
in RPMI supplemented with 20% FBS. HEK293T cells; sarcoma
cell lines RD, RH30, CTR, and RH4; and non-small cell lung can-
cer cell line A549 were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Peni-
cillin/streptomycin was added to all media. All cell lines were
cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 and periodically tested to confirm
the absence of mycoplasma.
Plasmid construction, sgRNA cloning, and shRNA cloning
For CRISPR screening, the optimized sgRNA lentiviral expres-
sion vector (LRG2.1T) and the lentiviral human codon-optimized
Cas9 vector (LentiV_Cas9_puro) were used. For the arrayed for-
mat competition-based assays, sgRNAs were cloned into the
LRG2.1 vector using a BsmBI restriction site. All sgRNA sequenc-
es in this study are listed in Supplemental Table 2. For the cDNA
rescue experiment, a POU2F3 cDNA (DNASU, plasmid ID
HsCD00329483) was cloned into the LentiV_Neo vector using
the In-Fusion cloning system. The CRISPR-resistant synonymous
mutant of POU2F3 was cloned using a standard PCR mutagenesis
method. For the IGFBP5 overexpression experiment, IGFBP5
cDNA (Addgene, pcDNA3-IGFBP5-V5, plasmid no. 11608) was
subcloned into LentiV_Puro vector using In-Fusion cloning.
shRNAs targeting POU2F3 and PCNA were cloned into the
mirE-based retroviral shRNA expression vector MLS-E. The se-
quences of each shRNA are summarized in Supplemental Table 2.
Construction of domain-focused sgRNA libraries
The human TF and kinase sgRNA pooled libraries were described
in a previous study (Tarumoto et al. 2018). In brief, the TF DNA-
binding domain and kinase domain annotations were retrieved
from NCBI Conserved Domains Database. Five to six sgRNAs
per domain were designed targeting 1427 TFs or 482 kinases in
the human genome. sgRNAs with the predicted high off-target ef-
fect were excluded. Domain targeting and spike-in positive/nega-
tive
control
sgRNA
oligonucleotides
were
synthesized
in
duplicate using an array platform (Twist Bioscience) and then
PCR-cloned into the Bsmb1-digested LRG2.1 vector using a Gib-
son assembly kit (New England Biolabs, E2611). To verify
the identity of and relative representative sgRNAs in the pooled
plasmids, a deep-sequencing analysis was performed on a MiSeq
instrument (Illumina), which confirmed that 100% of the de-
signed sgRNAs were cloned in the LRG2.1 vector and that the
abundance of >95% of individual sgRNA constructs was within
fivefold of the mean.
Virus transduction
Lentivirus was produced in HEK293T cells by transfecting plas-
mid and helper packaging plasmid (pVSVG and psPAX2) with pol-
yethylenimine (PEI 25000) transfection reagent. HEK293T cells
were plated 1 d before transfection with 70%–80% confluency
in a 10-cm tissue culture dish. For one 10-cm dish of HEK293T
cells, 10 µg of plasmid DNA, 5 µg of VSVG, 7.5 µg of psPAX2,
and 32 µL of 1 mg/mL PEI were mixed, incubated, and added to
the cells. Fresh medium was changed 8 h after transfection, and
lentivirus-containing supernatant was collected at 24, 48, and
72 h after transfection and pooled together.
For shRNA experiments, retrovirus was produced in Plat-E
cells, which were transfected with retroviral DNA, VSVG, and
Eco helper plasmids in a ratio of 10:1:1.5. Retrovirus-containing
supernatant was collected at 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection
and pooled together.
For both lentivirus and retrovirus infections, corresponding tar-
get cells were mixed with viral supernatant supplemented with
4 µg/mL polybrene and then centrifuged at 1700 rpm for 30 min
at room temperature. Fresh medium was changed 24 h after infec-
tion. Antibiotics (1 µg/mL puromycin and/or 1 mg/mL G418)
were added 24 h after infection when selection was required.
Pooled CRISPR screening
CRISPR-based negative selection genetic screenings were per-
formed in nonclonal cancer cell lines with stable Cas9 expression
(LentiV-Cas9-Puro vector). Lentivirus of a pooled sgRNA library
targeting DNA-binding domains or kinase domains was produced
as described above. To ensure a single-copy sgRNA transduction
per cell, multiplicity of infection (MOI) was set to 0.3–0.4. To
maintain the representation of sgRNAs during the screen, the
number of sgRNA-positive cells was kept at least 1000 times the
number of sgRNAs in the library. Cells were harvested at day 3 af-
ter infectionand wereprovided as a reference representation of the
pooled sgRNA library. Cells were cultured for 14 population dou-
blings and harvested as the final time point of the genetic screen.
Genomic DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA minikit (Qia-
gen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Sequencing libraries were constructed as described previously
(Shi et al. 2015). Briefly, the sgRNA cassette was PCR-amplified
from genomic DNA using high-fidelity polymerase (Phusion
master mix, Theromo Fisher, F548L). The PCR product was
end-repaired by T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs,
B02025), DNA polymerase I large (Klenow) fragment (New

 England Biolabs, M0210L), and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New
England Biolabs, M0201L). A 3′ A overhang was then added to
the ends of blunted DNA fragments with the Klenow fragment
(3′–5′ exo; New England Biolabs, M0212L). The DNA fragments
were ligated to diversity-increased custom barcodes with Quick
ligation kit (New England Biolabs, M2200L). Illumina paired-
end sequencing adaptors were attached to the barcoded ligated
products through PCR reaction with high-fidelity polymerase
(Phusion master mix, Thermo Fisher Scientific F548L). The final
libraries were quantified using a bioanalyzer Agilent DNA 1000
(Agilent 5067-1504) and then pooled together in equal molar ratio
followed by paired-end sequencing using MiSeq (Illumina) with
MiSeq reagent kit version 3 (Illumina).
Pooled CRISPR screening data analysis
The sequencing data were demultiplexed and trimmed to contain
only the sgRNA sequence cassettes. The read counts of each indi-
vidual sgRNA were calculated, allowing no mismatches to the
reference sgRNA sequence. Individual sgRNAs with a read count
<50 in the initial time point were discarded. The total read counts
were normalized between samples. The average log2 fold change
in abundance of all sgRNA against a given domain/gene was cal-
culated. SCLC-specificity was determined by subtracting the av-
erage of log2 fold change in non-SCLC cell lines from average log2
fold change in SCLC cell lines. The TF CRISPR screening data are
shown in Supplemental Table 1. The kinase CRISPR screening
data are shown in Supplemental Table 6.
Arrayed format competition-based assay to measure the effects
of sgRNAs on cell proliferation
Cas9-expressing SCLC cell lines were lentivirally transduced
with the LRG 2.1T sgRNA vector, which is linked to a GFP re-
porter, to achieve between 20% and 60% GFP-positive cells.
The percentage of GFP-positive cell population was measured
at various time points during culturing using a Guava Easycyte
HT instrument (Millipore). The relative change in GFP percent-
age was used to assess the impact of individual sgRNAs on cellu-
lar proliferation, which reflects cells with a genetic knockout
being outcompeted by nontransduced cells in the culture.
Human SCLC immunohistochemistry
The human SCLC tissue microarrays (TMAs) used in this study
were OD-CT-RsLug01-003, LC818, and LC245, purchased from
US Biomax. The TMA slides were stained with either H&E or a
POU2F3 antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-330).
The H&E-stained slides were used for SCLC morphology evalua-
tion by pathologist Dr. John E. Wilkinson. POU2F3 positivity in
the POU2F3 immunohistochemistry-stained slide was scored
on a five-point scale as follows: 0 = negative, 1 = positive staining
in <10% of cells, 2 = positive staining in >10% but <50% of cells,
3 = positive staining in >50% of cells, and 4 = almost all cells are
positively stained.
RNA-FISH
RNA-FISH was carried out using Alexa 594 dUTP-labeled nick
translated POU2F3 cDNA. The cells on coverslips were fixed in
4% freshly prepared PFA followed by permeablization with
0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were washed in multiple changes
of 2× SSC buffer for 2 h followed by hybridization with labeled
nick translated probe in 10% formamide, 10 µg of transfer RNA
(tRNA), and 2× SSC overnight at 37°C. Cells were washed in 2×
SSC and 50% formamide followed by washes in 1× and 0.5×
SSC, respectively. Finally, the cells were stained with DAPI,
and coverslips were mounted on glass slides. Images were ac-
quired and processed using a DeltaVision deconvolution micro-
scope. Images were stacked, and the number of nuclear foci was
manually counted across several random fields.
Tissue preparation for immunofluorescence and cell quantification
Freshly isolated trachea and lung tissue were fixed in 4% PFA for
2 h on ice, washed with PBS, and incubated in 30% sucrose in PBS
overnight at 4°C. Tissue was mounted in OCT embedding com-
pound and frozen at −80°C. Tissue sections (10 µm) were cut us-
ing a cryostat and incubated with 1× blocking buffer (5% goat
serum, 2.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h followed by in-
cubation in Fc receptor blocker (Innovex Biosciences) for 30 min.
Sections were incubated with rabbit anti-POU2F3 (1:100; Sigma-
Aldrich, HPA019652), mouse anti-CGRP (1:100; Abcam, ab81887),
APC-conjugated rat anti-EpCAM (1:100; BioLegend), mouse anti-
acetylated tubulin (1:400; Sigma-Aldrich, T7451), or mouse anti-
CC10 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, E-11) in 0.5× blocking
buffer overnight at 4°C. After rinsing twice with PBS, tissue sec-
tions were incubated with secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit
Alexa488 and goat anti-mouse Alexa568; 1:300 dilution; Life
Technologies) for 2 h at room temperature. Nuclei were counter-
stained with DAPI (1:1000 dilution; Life Technologies). Fluores-
cent images were collected using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal
laser scanning microscope (40× magnification) and an Olympus
BX53 fluorescent microscope (5× and 10× magnification). Image
acquisition and processing were conducted using the LAS AF
Lite program (Leica). POU2F3- and CGRP-expressing cells were
counted manually under a Zeiss fluorescent microscope (10×
and 20× magnification). The DAPI channel of the slides was
scanned by Aperio FL fluorescence slide scanner. The epithelial
regions were drawn manually in each slide. The number of nuclei
was counted using Aperio software.
Western blot
SCLC cells were counted before lysis with Laemmli sample buff-
er (Bio-Rad). One-million cells were lysed with 200 µL sample
buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 10 min. Equal
volumes of samples were separated by SDS-PAGE gel followed by
transfer to nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotting. Prima-
ry antibodies used in this study included POU2F3 (1:1000; Sigma,
HPA019652), ASCL1 (1:1000; BD Biosciences, clone 24B72D11.1
), and NEUROD1 (1:1000; Abcam, ab60704).

 RNA-seq library construction
Total RNA of SCLC cell lines was extracted using TRIzol reagent
(Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, ∼10 million cells were lysed with 1 mL of TRIzol and chlo-
roform and incubated for 3 min at room temperature followed by
centrifugation at 10,000g for 15 min at 4°C. The aqueous phase
was added to 500 µL of isopropanol and incubated for 10 min at
room temperature. RNA was precipitated at 10,000g for 10 min
at4°C, washedwith 75%EtOH in DEPC-treated water, and eluted
in RNase-free water. RNA-seq libraries were constructed using
the TruSeq sample preparation kit version 2 (Illumina) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 2 µg of purified RNA
was poly-A-selected and fragmented with fragmentation enzyme.
After first and second strand synthesis from a template of poly-A-
selected/fragmented RNA, other procedures from end repair to
PCR amplification were performed according to ChIP-seq library
construction steps. The quantity of the RNA-seq library was de-
termined by nanodrop, and the average quantity of RNA-seq li-
braries ranged from 40 to 80 ng/µL. Multiplexing for sequencing
was performed as described for ChIP-seq library construction.
RNA-seq libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500
or NextSeq platform with single-end reads of 50 bases.
RNA-seq data analysis
Sequencing reads were mapped into reference genome hg19 using
TopHat. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed using
Cufflinks and Cuffdiff with masking of all noncoding RNAs.
Genes with RPKM (reads per kilobase per million mapped reads)
of more than three in the control were considered as expressed
genes in subsequent analyses.
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
The fold change of RPKM was calculated by the ratio of the aver-
age RPKM of two independent sgRNA samples (sgPOU2F3 [e10.1
and e10.2]) to the RPKM of control sgRNA samples (sgNeg). The
ranked list was prepared using the log2 fold change of all ex-
pressed genes. Group 1 gene signatures were derived from patient
sample RNA-seq from George et al. (2015) with an expression ra-
tio of average group 1 RPKM versus average group 2 RPKM of >5
(gene lists are in Supplemental Tables 3, 4). Custom P-element
genes were obtained by the association of each P element to its
nearest expressed gene using annotatePeaks from the Homer
suite (the gene list is in Supplemental Table 5). GSEA was per-
formed using the custom gene signatures.
Unsupervised expression clustering and gene expression level comparison
We took all of the 81 SCLC patient sample RNA-seq data (George
et al. 2015) and computed sample correlations using the top 1000
genes that show the highest MAD (median absolute deviation)
across all samples to check whether there were any outliers. Since
samples S02297 and S02353 had a Spearman correlation coeffi-
cient of <0.7 across all of the other samples, we omitted these
samples from all downstream analysis. Unsupervised expression
clustering was reconstructed as described by George et al. (2015).
We first obtained the “differentially expressed genes in SCLC pa-
tient samples” gene set from this prior study and separated sam-
ples into two groups for a high and low expression using
hierarchical clustering of gene expression (Euclidean distance
and complete linkage) on the log2(1 + RPKM values) as described
(George et al. 2015).
Using the same “differentially expressed genes in SCLC patient
samples” gene set and clustering strategy, we performed the unsu-
pervisedexpression clustering usingthe RNA-seqdata of 14 SCLC
cell lines used in this study, the data of 42 SCLC cell lines from the
cancer cell line encyclopedia (CCLE) (PMID:22460905), and the
microarray data of 23 SCLC patient samples from Sato et al.
(2013). For the cell line RNA-seq data, we used gene expression
levels instead of considering isoform expression levels. For the mi-
croarray data set, the normalized MAS5 intensity values of the in-
dividual gene probes were averaged for the gene expression values.
Hierarchical clustering (Euclidean distance and complete linkage)
was performed on the log2 transformed raw expression values.
Gene expression analysis of SCLC patient samples
For the patient cohort with RNA-seq data (George et al. 2015), the
available data contain RPKM values of isoforms only. In order to
estimate gene-level expression, we reversed the step of normaliz-
ing by feature lengths in the calculation of RPKM to get fragment
counts of each isoform with actual size. To do this, we divided
isoform RPKM value by 1000 and multiplied it by its length.
Next, for each gene, we added up the resulting counts of all iso-
forms and then normalized to the length of 1000 base pairs (bp).
Gene expression level comparisons were performed using raw
RPKM values in RNA-seq data. For the 23 SCLC patient sample
cohort with microarray data (Sato et al. 2013), there were
11,037 genes with MAS5(int) > 200 in at least one sample. Only
these genes were used in further analysis. All probes of each given
gene were averaged for further analysis.
ChIP assay
For ChIP experiment with SCLC cell lines, 5 × 106 cells were
cross-linked for 15 min at room temperature with formaldehyde
(1% final) with constant shaking and then quenched with 0.125
M glycine for 15 min. Cells were pelleted and washed with PBS.
Cells were then lysed with 1 mL of cell lysis buffer (10 mM
Tris-Cl at pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 0.2% NP-40) with protease inhib-
itor and incubated for 10 min at 4°C. Chromatin was isolated by
centrifugation at 4200 rpm for 30 sec and lysed with 500 µL of nu-
clear lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl at pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1%
SDS) with protease inhibitor followed by incubation for 10 min
at 4°C. Lysed chromatin was then sonicated for 15 min at low in-
tensity for 0.5 sec using a Bioruptor (Diagenode). Chromatin was
centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C, pellets were discard-
ed, the supernatants were preincubated for 2 h with 3.5 mL of im-
munoprecipitation dilution buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl at pH 8.0,
2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS)
and 1 µg of rabbit antibody (H3K27ac [Abcam, ab4729] and
POU2F3 [Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-330]), and 20 µL of pro-
tein A magnetic beads (Invitrogen) was added for incubation over-
night with rotation at 4°C.
The next day, immunocomplexes were washed once with im-
munoprecipitation wash I buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl at pH 8.0,
2 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), twice
with high-salt buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl at pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA,
500 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS), once with immu-
noprecipitation wash II buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl at pH 8.0, 1 mM
EDTA, 0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP-40, 1% Na-deoxycholate), and twice
with TE (pH 8.0). The washed immunocomplexes were eluted
with 200 µL of elution buffer (50 mM Tris 8.0, 10 mM EDTA,
1% SDS) for 15 min at 65°C with constant shaking and reverse
cross-linking with addition of 1 µg/µL RNase A and 0.25 M
NaCl overnight at 65°C in a water bath. The next day, immuno-
precipitated DNA was treated with 0.2 mg/mL proteinase K for
2 h at 42°C and purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit in
55 µL of distilled water.

 ChIP-seq library construction
ChIP-seq libraries were constructed using the TruSeq ChIP sam-
ple preparation kit (Illumina). Briefly, 50 µL of purified ChIP DNA
was end-repaired for dA tailing followed by adaptor ligation.
Adaptor-ligated ChIP DNA was size-selected (250–300 bp) via
agarose gel electrophoresis, gel-extracted with QIAquick gel ex-
traction kit, and used for 15 cycles of PCR amplification. Ampli-
fied DNA was finally purified with SPRI cleanup by AMPure XP
beads (Invitrogen). The quality of the ChIP-seq library was deter-
mined by bioanalyzer using the high-sensitivity chip (Agilent),
and the average size of the ChIP-seq libraries ranged from 250
to 350 bp. Equal molar quantities of libraries were combined
and sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq platform with single-
end reads of 75 bases.
ChIP-seq peak calling method and annotation
All ChIP-seq data sets were mapped to the build version GRCh37/
HG19 of the human genome using Bowtie2. Peak calling was
done using a MACS2 false discovery rate cutoff of 5% with the
broad peak and narrow peak option for H3K27ac and TF ChIP-
seq data sets, respectively. Peaks were annotated to the closest ex-
pressed gene using annotatePeaks from the Homer suite. To com-
pare the enhancer landscape of SCLC cell lines, all called peaks
across the H3K27ac ChIP-seq data sets were combined into a sin-
gle peak interval set, while overlapping peaks were merged into a
single interval using BEDtools. For global correlation analysis,
peak intensities (50-bin average normalized tag count) were cal-
culated for each H3K27ac data set using a combined interval set
followed by Pearson correlation. Correlation coefficients were
used to calculate a dissimilarity value (1 = correlation coefficient)
that was subsequently used to generate unsupervised clustering
(Ward/Euclidean distance) of the epigenetic landscape between
the cell lines. Distance in the phylogenetic tree represents the dis-
similarity. A normalized tag count was calculated using the Bam-
liquidator package (https://github.com/BradnerLab/pipeline).
Identification of P, N, and A elements
P, N, and A groups of cis elements were identified by calculating
the H3K27ac peak intensities using the single peak interval set.
The peak intensities of POU2F3-expressing (P), NEUROD1-ex-
pressing (N), or ASCL1-expressing (A) cell lines were compared
with the average peak intensity of the corresponding nonexpress-
ing cell lines identifying 463 regions (P), 697 regions (N), or 414
regions (A) of increased H3K27ac marks, respectively. Regions
with a uniform peak intensity gain of at least fourfold and a min-
imum average peak intensity of 0.1 were considered.
Motif enrichment analysis
For transcriptional factor-binding motif analysis of 500 bp around
the summit of the gained H3K27ac regions, AME (MEME suite
and the JASPER and Homo sapiens Comprehensive Model Col-
lection [HOCOMOCO] database) was used. For motifs for enrich-
ment at P, N, and A elements, de novo motifs for NEUROD1
(GSE69398) or ASCL1 (GSE69398) (MEME-ChIP) were added to
the JASPER and HOCOMOCO merged databases.
Generation of ChIP-seq tracks and heat maps
ChIP-seq tracks of individual loci were generated using the Uni-
versity of California at Santa Cruz genome browser. Heat map
density plots and metaplots were generated using ±5 kb around
each center of the H3K27ac peak intervals with 50-bp binning
size. Metaplots for POU2F3, NEUROD1 (GSE69398), or ASCL1
(GSE69398) occupancy were generated from ChIP-seq data sets
in NCI-H526, NCI-H82, or NCI-H128 cells, respectively.
Data availability
All next-generation sequencing data have been deposited in the
NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number
GSE115124.
