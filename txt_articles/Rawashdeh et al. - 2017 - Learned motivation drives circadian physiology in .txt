ABSTRACT: The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)—often referred to as the master circadian clock—is essential in
generating physiologic rhythms and orchestrating synchrony among circadian clocks. This study tested the hy-
pothesis that periodic motivation induced by rhythmically pairing 2 reinforcing stimuli [methamphetamine (Meth)
and running wheel (RW)] restores autonomous circadian activity in arrhythmic SCN-lesioned (SCNX) C3H/HeN
mice. Sham-surgery and SCNX mice were treated with either Meth (1.2 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle in association,
dissociation, or absence of an RW. Only the association of Meth treatment and restricted RW access successfully
reestablished entrained circadian rhythms in mice with SCNX. RW—likely acting as a link between the circadian
and rewardsystems—promotes circadian entrainment of activity. We conclude that a conditioned drug responseis a
powerful tool to entrain, drive, and restore circadian physiology. Furthermore, an RW should be recognized as a
potent input signal in addition to the conventional use as an output signal.—Rawashdeh, O., Clough, S. J., Hudson,

Rhythmic cues, or zeitgebers, entrain and drive the circa-
dian system (1), particularly photic information, which
acts as the most prominent and influential of such zeitge-
bers. Light is transmitted as neurochemical signals from
the retina via the retinohypothalamic tract to a central
nucleus (2) in the hypothalamus, which is termed the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN is known to
drive and orchestrate synchrony among central and pe-
ripheral circadian oscillators (3) and thus represents the
master circadian clock (4, 5). SCN lesions (SCNXs) in
mammals (6), exposure to constant bright light (7), or ad-
ministration of psychostimulants (8) alter rhythmicity in
locomotor activity (9, 10), feeding rhythms (11), and tem-
perature rhythms (12), among other behaviors (9, 13, 14).
In the central nervous system (CNS), there are at
least 2 anatomical structures—the olfactory bulb and the
habenula—that remain rhythmic on a molecular and
functional level in the absence of the SCN (15–18). Of in-
terest, both neuroanatomical structures project to the central
dopaminergic reward system in the brain (18–24). Indeed,
studies have shown that certain reward-related behaviors
vary according to a circadian rhythm (25), which confirms
the existence of a physiological and functional connection
between the circadian and reward systems (26–30).
Psychostimulants, such as methamphetamine (Meth)
and cocaine, not only exert their effects by targeting the
mesolimbic dopamine pathway, but also by influencing the
circadian system (31, 32). Meth, for instance, reconstitutes
rhythmicity in SCNX mice (7). Of note, reappearance of
physiological and behavioral rhythmicity with Meth, in-
cluding rhythms in locomotor activity, feeding, drinking,
body temperature, and plasma corticosterone levels, are
stableenoughtopersistevenunderconstantconditions(33).
To date, the anatomical location of the Meth-sensitive cir-
cadian oscillator (MASCO), or the mechanism by which
Meth promotes rhythmicity (7, 34), has remained elusive.
In SCN-intact rhythmic mice, ad libitum access to 0.005%
Meth in the drinking water splits the wheel-running
activity rhythm into a rhythm with a period of approxi-
mately 24 h (t , 24 h), termed the light-entrainable, SCN-
dependentrhythm,andasecond,muchlongerfree-running
activity rhythm (t . 24 h), which is known as the MASCO-
driven rhythm (7, 32, 35). The 2 oscillators—the light-
entrainable circadian oscillator in the SCN and the
MASCO—must be regulated by separate anatomical en-
tities,astheMASCOisabletopersistinSCNXmice(33,36).

 Of interest, the majority of studies have investigated the
MASCO by using running wheels (RWs) to assess circa-
dian activity in rodents (32, 33, 37). Use of an RW in such
studies is potentially confounding, as an RW itself has re-
wardingandreinforcingproperties(38,39).Indeed,wheel-
running activity is not limited to rodents in a laboratory
setting, as mice in the wild will use an RW if introduced
into their natural habitat (40). In addition, rats will selec-
tively choose to spend more time in a chamber that was
previously paired with an RW in a conditioned place
preference paradigm (39). Of importance, exercise and/
or the reinforcement associated with operating an RW
produces plastic changes in the striatum, which is a crucial
component of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway (38, 41).
Therefore, we hypothesize that RW is important for the re-
establishment of behavioral rhythms post-Meth treatment.
Thecurrentstudysoughttoexaminethespecificrolesof
2 potential reinforcers, Meth and RW, with known actions
in the mesolimbic pathway, for their ability to induce
rhythmic activity in SCNX mice. Here, we demonstrate
that Meth is only able to reestablish rhythmic activity in
arrhythmic SCNX mice when administered in conjunction
withrestricted access to an RW, but not when these stimuli
are temporally separated. Of importance, we demonstrate
the need for the presence of an RW after treatment with
Meth for both expression and maintenance of rhythmicity
in SCNX mice. We conclude that the rhythmic pairing of
Meth with RW activity represents a cyclic reinforcement
of reward and motivation, which ensures maintenance of
behavioral rhythmicity if ad libitum access to RW is pro-
vided. Hence, RW functions as the gateway for cycling
motivation to rhythmically provide feedback and drive
the MASCO.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and husbandry
Male wild-type C3H/HeN mice were generated from breeding
pairs that were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN, USA)
and were maintained in the Laboratory Animal Facility at the
University at Buffalo or purchased at 7–8 wk of age from Harlan.
Mice from our colony were bred under a 14-h:10-h light:dark
(LD) cycle in humidity and temperature-controlled (22 6 1°C)
rooms with food (Harlan Teklad 2018sx) and water provided ad
libitum. Male mice were group housed (3–5/cage) at weaning or
time of delivery and were maintained in a 12-h LD cycle, with
150–200 lux light illumination at the level of the cage. Animals
were housed in standard polycarbonate translucent cages (30 3
19 cm) that contained corncob bedding. All animal procedures
were adhered to the National Institutes of Health guidelines and
were approved by the University at Buffalo Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee.
Surgery
Mice (age 2–5 mo), weighing approximately 30–35 g, underwent
electrolytic SCNX or sham surgery. Mice were anesthetized with
pentobarbital (56 mg/kg, i.p.) and administered the analgesic
buprenorphine(0.03mg/kg,s.c.)beforesurgery.Anteroposterior,
mediolateral, and dorsoventral coordinates relative to bregma
were 0.0, 0.0, and 25.3 mm, respectively. To lesion the SCN
centrally, we used a polyimide-coated tungsten wire electrode
(A-M Systems, Sequim, WA, USA) with a 1-mm tip exposure,
through which a 1.0-mA current was passed for 30 s. Postsurgery,
mice were individually housed in a 12-h LD cycle and adminis-
tered the analgesic carprofen (0.5 mg/tablet/d for 3 d).
Mice were allowed a minimum of 1 wk to recover from sur-
gery before introduction of an RW into their home cage. At the
time of RW presentation, mice were exposed to constant dark-
ness. Successful SCNXs were initially confirmed from the acto-
gramsofeitherRWorvideo-trackinghorizontalactivityandlater
by histologic analysis of SCNXs (see following section). Of note,
animals without an SCN were arrhythmic in their locomotor
activity Fig. 1. All mice with rhythmic activity profiles post-
lesioning (20%), as determined by x2 analysis, were excluded
from experiments. Sham-surgery animals underwent the same
surgical procedures as did those mice for SCNXs without ap-
plying electrical current.
Immunofluorescence
After behavioral experiments, all mice were anesthetized with
0.24 ml/kg 2, 2, 2-tribromoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA); 1.4%; Avertin) and were perfused transcardially with ice-
cold 0.9% saline for 10 min, followed by 20-min fixation using 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4). Brains were dissected,
postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 h at 25°C, and transferred
to 30% sucrose cryoprotectant for 2 d at 4°C. Brains were em-
beddedinoptimalcuttingtemperaturecompound(SakuraFinetek,
Torrance, CA, USA), flash frozen in 2-methylbutane on dry ice,
and stored at 280°C. To assess and confirm SCNXs, all collected
brains were sliced into 30-mm cryosections. Slices that contained
SCN (rostral to caudal) were collected for subsequent immuno-
fluorescence staining for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) as
previously described (42).
In brief, sections were washed and incubated with 1:2000
rabbit anti-VIP primary antibody (ImmunoStar, Hudson, WI,
USA) in PBS that contained 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1% normal
goat serum overnight at 4°C. Sections were stained with 1:1000
Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 60 min and were
coverslipped with Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Images of the SCN
or lack thereof were acquired by using a 320 objective under a
Nikon Eclipse fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY,
USA). Because VIP is extensively expressed in SCN, the absence
of a positive VIP immunofluorescence signal was used as an
indicator for successful SCN lesions (Fig. 1A, D).
RW activity and home cage activity
Wheel-running activity was recorded via microswitches attached
to the wheels, which measured wheel revolutions. Data were
continuously collected with a computer and use of CLOCK Lab
software (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL, USA). Horizontal activity or
home cage activity was measured for experiments in which RWs
were not used by utilizing the Home Cage Scan system (HCS;
CleverSys, Reston, VA, USA), a video tracking system described
in Adamah-Biassi et al. (43). Horizontal activity reported in this
study refers collectively to movements that correspond to walk-
left, walk-right, walk-slow, turning, and circling behavior.

 in cages that were equipped with an RW for 7 d to habituate
the mice to the wheel, confirm the success of the lesions, and
to determine baseline behavior in circadian rhythms of loco-
motor activity (Fig. 1). RW was then removed from the cage for a
period of 7 d.
Treatment protocol
Mice underwent one of 4 treatment protocols described below
and were administered either Meth (1.2 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle
(Veh) (0.9% saline, i.p.). All treatment periods lasted 14 d and
consisted of single daily injections. Mice were weighed every
3–4 d. Mice with weight loss of greater than 15% were removed
from the study. Treatment protocols were as follows:
Treatment 1: Mice were injected with Veh or Meth only. No
RW was provided during treatment; horizontal locomo-
tor activity was continuously monitored with HCS.
Treatments 2 and 3: Injections of Veh or Meth were
temporally associated with RW presentation. RW access
was provided for 8 h.
Treatment 4: Injections of Veh or Meth were temporally
dissociated from RW presentation. RW was provided 8 h
after injections, with access lasting 16 h.
Posttreatment protocol
After the treatment phase, all animals were set to free-running
conditions of ad libitum access to RW or its continuous ab-
sence. All posttreatment periods lasted 7 d. Mice that
received treatments 2 and 4 were monitored via continuous
access to RW. Mice that received treatments 1 and 3 were
monitored via horizontal activity with HCS.
Drug preparation
(+)-Methamphetamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) was
dissolved in 0.9% saline and administered at a dose of 1.2 mg/kg
via intraperitoneal injections in a volume of 0.01 ml/g. This dose
was chosen on the basis of previous studies in our laboratory
(44–46). Mice were randomly assigned to groups that received
either Veh (0.9% saline, i.p.) or Meth (1.2 mg/kg, i.p.).
Statistical analysis
Actograms were generated and analyzed with MatLab
R2012a (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) as previously de-
scribed (47). Block size was set to 5 min for all actograms.
Periodogram analyses were performed by using the ClockLab
analysis program (Actimetrics) on 6 d of continuous data be-
fore treatment and 6 d of continuous data posttreatment
(Table 1). Average period lengths for sham-surgery mice be-
fore and after treatment were compared by using paired
Student’s t test. For treatment 1, average horizontal distance
traveled was calculated by averaging the counts per minute
for 2-h postinjection for all days for which data was collected
throughout the treatment phase. Average counts were com-
pared between treatment groups by unpaired Student’s t test.

RESULTS
SCN electrolytic lesions
Confirmation of successful SCNXs were initially inferred by
examiningRWactivitypatternsbeforefurthertreatmentsand
were confirmed postmortem by the absence of VIP immu-
nofluorescence signal from coronal brain slices. Figure 1A
shows a representative RW actogram for sham-surgery mice
thatwerehousedinconstantdarknessandthecorresponding
periodogram that reflects the robustness of the circadian ac-
tivityrhythmbymeansofamplitudeandperiodicity(t:23.58
h; Fig. 1B). As expected, all sham-surgery animals were pos-
itive for VIP in intact SCN (Fig. 1C) (4, 42).
Figure 1D illustrates a representative actogram for an
SCNX mouse and shows an arrhythmic pattern of locomotor
activity compared with sham-surgery mice (Fig. 1A). Lack of
a clearly defined circadian activity rhythm was supported by
periodogram analysis (Fig. 1E), and lack of a positive VIP
immunofluorescence signal within the hypothalamic area
[anteroposterior:20.22to20.82mmrelative to bregma(48)]
corresponds to the anatomic location of SCNX (Fig. 1F).
Effect of Meth treatment on horizontal
locomotor activity
Sham-surgery and SCNX mice were placed in cages that
were equipped with RWs for 7 d to evaluate lesions on the
basis of the nature of the animals’ activity profiles. After
confirming the lesions, RWs were removed until the start
of the experiment 7 d later (Fig. 2A, D).
The first experiment sought to determine the ability
of timed Meth application alone to reestablish and
entrain an activity rhythm in the absence of SCN. Ac-
cordingly, sham-surgery mice that were treated with
Veh alone (Fig. 2B) continued to free run in the post-
treatment phase with a t similar to the pretreatment
period (Table 1, group 1, mice 1 and 2). Furthermore,
daily and timed Veh treatment did not shift the
rhythm; however, daily Meth treatments resulted in an
increase of spontaneous horizontal activity for 2 h post-
injection (Fig. 2E) in SCN-intact mice [Meth: 375.4 6 62.0
average counts/min; n = 4 vs. Veh: 54.1 6 16.33 av-
erage counts/min; n = 3; P , 0.05]. In SCNX mice, Veh
(Fig. 2C) and Meth treatment (Fig. 2F) exhibited simi-
lar arrhythmic activity patterns. Of note, SCNX mice
remained responsive to Meth-induced hyperactivity
(Meth: 446.2 6 68.9 average counts/min; n = 4 vs. Veh:
76.2 6 16.4 average counts/min; n = 4; P , 0.05) after
daily treatments without reestablishing autonomous
behavioral rhythmicity (Fig. 2F).
Effect of pairing RW access with Meth
treatment on circadian entrainment
Because Meth potentiates horizontal (home cage) ac-
tivity and RW activity activates the reward system, we
predicted that pairing Meth injections with RW access
will potentiate the impact of Meth on the mesolimbic
system. Effects of associating 2 reinforcing stimuli,

 Meth and RW, on the animals’ ability to reestablish
rhythmicity in locomotor activity were assessed in
otherwise arrhythmic SCNX mice. After the end of the
treatment period, we examined the influence of asso-
ciating the 2 reinforcing stimuli on the capacity to
generate a self-sustainable circadian rhythm in activity
under free-running conditions of ad libitum access to an
RW and the absence of Meth (Fig. 3A, D).
Periodic access to RW did not alter the endogenous
locomotor rhythm in Veh-treated SCN-intact (sham-
surgery) mice (Fig. 3B). Similarly, Meth treatment
(1.2 mg/kg, i.p.), paired with RW access, in SCN-intact
mice had no entrainment or phase-shifting effects (Fig.
3E). For both treatments, onset of activity after the
phase of periodic RW access could be predicted by the
onset of activity before treatment, which indicated that
the manipulation did not alter the underlying clock.
This is further supported through the apparent sta-
bility of the periodicities across the pre- and post-
treatment stages (Table 1, B2).
Veh-treated SCNX-mice (Fig. 3C) display arrhythmic
free-running activity throughout the pre- and post-
treatment periods of the experiment. SCNX mice that
were treated with Meth in association with RW pre-
sentation exhibit a self-sustainable circadian activity
rhythm in the majority (8 of 12 mice; 67%) of otherwise
arrhythmic SCNX mice. Induction of rhythmicity was
confirmed during the posttreatment phase as reflected by
rhythmic RW activity under free-running conditions of
constant darkness and ad libitum access to a RW (Fig. 3F).
Figure 2. Meth alone is insufficient to reestablish circadian rhythmicity in SCNX mice. Horizontal activity of C3H/HeN mice that
were treated with Meth or Veh was monitored by using HCS. Horizontal activity was recorded for at least 3 d before treatment.

free-running activity rhythms, as evidenced by the periodograms located below the actogram. C, F) Veh-treated (C) and Meth-
treated (F) SCNX mice remained arrhythmic after treatment, confirmed by x2 analysis and resulting periodogram.

 Of note, the newly developed self-sustainable circadian
activity rhythm of SCNX mice had a period similar to that
of sham-surgery animals (Table 1, group 2, mice 2 and 4).
Next, we sought to determine whether the RW is
important for maintaining rhythmicity after condi-
tioning of Meth with RW access (treatment). This was
accomplished by removing the RW after the treat-
ment period and monitoring horizontal activity via
HCS (Fig. 4A, D). Sham-surgery mice that received
Veh (Fig. 4B) or Meth (Fig. 4E) treatment in association
with restricted running wheel access during d 14–28
showed no treatment-specific response. This is con-
sistent across activity profiles for both RW and HCS
recordings. In addition, neither treatment with Veh
nor Meth significantly altered the free-running period
(compare pre- and posttreatment phases; Table 1, group
3, mouse 2).
Veh-treated SCNX mice (Fig. 4C) display arrhyth-
mic free-running activity throughout the pre- and
posttreatment periods of the experiment. In contrast to
results from experiment 2, removal of RW for the du-
ration of the free-running posttreatment period elimi-
nated the self-sustainability of the circadian activity
rhythm that was otherwise observed when Meth-
treated SCNX mice were provided ad libitum access to
the RW (Figs. 3F and 4F).

Associating Veh injections with RW access was ineffective in reestablishing rhythmicity in SCNX mice; however, associating Meth
injections with RW access (F) successfully established free-running activity rhythms (compare pretreatment periodogram with
posttreatment). HC, home cage.

 Effect of temporal separation of RW and
Meth treatment
Thefourthexperimentsought toconfirmtheimportanceof
the association of Meth and RW access in driving the
MASCO and, thus, the observed behavioral rhythmicity.
This was accomplished by temporally separating the pre-
sentation of RW from Meth or Veh treatments (Fig. 5A, D).
Temporal dissociation of RW presentation and Veh or
Meth treatment (Fig. 5B, E) did not influence the character-
istics of circadian activity profiles for mice with an intact
SCN. Indeed, temporally separated RW access from either
treatment (Fig. 5B, E) had no effect on the period length of
the free-running activity rhythm before and after treatment
(Table 1, group 4, mice 1 and 2). Veh-treated SCNX mice
(Fig. 5C) remained arrhythmic throughout the entire ex-
periment. In contrast to animals to which RW and Meth
were presented simultaneously (see Fig. 3: treatment pro-
tocol 2), Meth treatment that was temporally dissociated
from RW presentation (Fig. 5F) was ineffective for the
reestablishment of activity rhythms in SCNX mice. This is
evidenced by the lack of a free-running self-sustainable ac-
tivity rhythm entrained to either the timing of Meth treat-
ment or RW access.
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that restoration and maintenance
of behavioral rhythmicity by the MASCO in SCNX mice is

 dependent on access to an RW. Furthermore, concurrent
access to the 2 reinforcing stimuli, RW and Meth, is key for
restoration of circadian locomotor rhythms in arrhythmic
C3H/HeN mice with lesions of the master circadian clock,
the SCN. Concomitantly, we show that neither reinforcing
stimuli on its own is sufficient to alter rhythmicity in SCN-
intact mice. This result suggests that a destabilized circa-
dian system (SCNX) imposes a significant physiological
challenge by changing the reinforcing value and motiva-
tion for addictive substances via direct effects on reward
circuits (see review in ref. 49). This also implies that con-
ditioned drug responses are more effective and, thus, of
greater therapeutic value in states of circadian disorders
and/or disequilibrium—a forgotten remedy that needs
revisiting.
We hypothesized that entrainment of RW activity
rhythms observed in SCNX mice is mediated via an extra-
SCN oscillator and is the product of the reinforcing prop-
erties that are garnered from both Meth and RW. This
rhythm persists for at least 7 d after the end of treatment,
which is similar to the persistence observed after Meth
treatment via drinking water (7). Reinstatement of rhyth-
mic activity in arrhythmic SCNX mice is likely a result of
actions in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, which has
been shown to interact with the circadian system (27, 30).
Locomotor activity in both diurnal and nocturnal ani-
mals is rhythmic and driven by the circadian clock in the
SCN (10, 50, 51) and, thus, is considered to be an output of
the clock. In rodents, the circadian rhythm in RW activity
also reflects a rhythm in motivation, as an animal is not

 forced to access or use the RW to exercise. Of interest,
running in a novel RW can phase-shift the SCN clock in
hamsters(52); thus,not only are locomotoractivity and/or
motivation an output of the SCN, but activity-induced
activation of the reward system (38) can also provide
feedback to modulate the circadian system. Accordingly,
the natural reward associated with exercise by using an
RW may function as a mediator for the reward system to
gain access to, and subsequently influence, the circadian
system. To a rodent, an RW can be a reinforcing stimulus,
as demonstrated by behavioral studies in which rodents
will work to gain access to an RW (53, 54) as well as by
place preference studies for the aftereffects of RW (39).
Moreover, when an RW is removed from the home cage,
rodents show signs of withdrawal comparable to those
associated with drugs of abuse in humans (55–58). RW
activity results in molecular adaptations within the mes-
olimbic dopamine pathway, including an increase in
synaptic dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (41, 59).
Collectively, this suggests that RW alone is a strong can-
didate for the reinstatement of rhythmicity. However, on
the basis of our data, this is not the case, as RW associated
with (treatment 2) or temporally separated from (treat-
ment4)Vehinjectionsfailedtoinduce rhythmicactivityin
SCNX mice. Furthermore, presentation of an RW was
unable to alter the endogenous rhythm of mice with an
intact SCN. This suggests that RW, although a strong re-
inforcer on its own, is not sufficient to activate the extra-
SCN clock (MASCO), which is central for development of
rhythmic activity in SCNX mice.
The highly addictive psychostimulant Meth exerts its
primary actions within the mesolimbic dopamine path-
way, where its actions result in increased dopamine re-
lease and reward sensation (60). Meth is considered to be
highly reinforcing in rodents as demonstrated by self-
administration, sensitization, and conditioned place pref-
erence studies (44, 46, 61). Meth alters synaptic plasticity
within the reward pathway in a manner similar to RW.
Several previous studies have suggested that Meth is key
in driving the MASCO, which results in the reinstatement
of behavioral rhythmicity in SCNX mice (7, 36).
The current standing in the field suggests that RW
functions as a reinforcer of Meth in driving the
MASCO, as Meth administered via drinking water has
also been shown to reestablish horizontal locomotor
activity. However, our data do not support this notion,
as in the current experiments, daily Meth treatment
alone is not sufficient to reestablish rhythmicity in
SCNX mice (treatment 1). We conclude that in our
current paradigm of Meth treatment in the absence of
RW, Meth is not sufficient to initiate, drive, or entrain
the extra-SCN oscillator. Thus, RW must play a role in
the ability of Meth to reestablish rhythmicity and
drive the entrainment observed in our study. Restricted
RW access alone could not drive the extra-SCN oscil-
lator in SCNX mice; therefore, it is likely that RW and
Meth reciprocally reinforce each other to drive the os-
cillator, perhaps by amplifying the activation of the
reward system. It is possible that the combination of
Meth and RW works within the dopamine system
to activate and strengthen a dopaminergic ultradian
oscillator (62). It has been shown that increasing con-
centrations of Meth lengthens ultradian locomotor
rhythms into the infradian range, of which the MASCO
may be a manifestation (62). Although our study uses a
low dose of Meth administered once daily, as opposed
to continuously via drinking water, it is likely that the
presence of the RW synergistically increases dopamine
release to a level that results in the lengthening of the
period of the ultradian rhythm into circadian activity
rhythms.
Previous studies have suggested that the RW is not
essential for the induction of rhythmic behavior in SCNX
mice, exemplifying the ability of Meth to induce rhythmic
horizontal activity instead (34). This is in contrast to the
results of our study, during which 14 d of daily Meth
treatment remained insufficient to induce rhythmic hori-
zontal locomotor activity in SCNX mice. A possible ex-
planation for this discrepancy is the way in which Meth
was administered. Previous studies that examined the
entrainment of horizontal activity by the MASCO used ad
libitum Meth in drinking water (34). In contrast, our
studies used single daily treatments via injections of
Meth. Providing Meth via drinking water could allow
for a higher exposure to Meth. In addition, drinking be-
havior itself has a reinforcing component (63); therefore,
pairing Meth with this behavior may also have a syner-
gistic effect.
These data suggest that activation of the MASCO and
its rhythmic sustainability in driving locomotor activity
cycles is a result of the combined reinforcing properties
garnered from the conditioned association of Meth with
RW access. Indeed, neither Meth nor RW alone can ini-
tiate rhythmic behavior. Psychostimulants have been
shown to enhance wheel-running activity (64), which
could be the mechanism for the efficient activation of the
MASCO.However,thestudybyKosobudetal.(65)shows
that the intense increase in gross motor behavior post-
Meth treatment is not required for entrainment or ex-
pression of anticipatory drug-related circadian rhythms.
Pairing of Meth and RW reflects a form of classic
conditioning/learning by associating an uncondi-
tional (Meth) and semiconditional (RW) stimulus. Our
working model suggests that the entrainable extra-SCN
oscillator is directly coupled to motivation (Fig. 6). This
oscillator can only sustain itself rhythmically in the
presence of an RW, which likely functions to initiate
another cycle of rest and activity. This phenomenon is
sustainable under free-running conditions and in the
absence of the unconditional stimulus, Meth. It relies on
the association between pleasure and/or motivation
that is triggered by Meth and the restricted access to
RW. Consequently, once the association is established,
the RW should trigger the same physiological state
sparked by Meth. Thus, we speculate that the RW closes
the feedback circuitry to establish a maintained circa-
dian activity profile in the absence of the master circa-
dian clock in the SCN (Fig. 6). It is therefore possible that
Meth paired with other stimuli may also be able to re-
store the MASCO rhythm.
Drug addiction is linked to altered circadian rhythms.

 environmental desynchrony can be a risk factor for ad-
diction, relapse, and withdrawal (28, 30, 49, 66-68). Drug
addicts suffer from disturbed circadian rhythms, particu-
larly in their sleep cycles (69). Sleep disturbances persist
beyondthewithdrawalphaseand,ofinterest,arelinkedto
relapse (70, 71). Although, we did not directly assess sleep,
the ability of Meth, in conjunction with RW access, to re-
instate ;24-h rest/activity rhythms in arrhythmic mice
that lacked a master circadian clock likely reflects a re-
establishment of sleep cycles among other rescued physi-
ologic parameters. The described paradigm reflects a form
of classical Pavlovian conditioning in which the un-
conditional stimulus, Meth, is paired with a conditional/
reinforcing stimulus of nonharmful nature, exercise.
Once exercise is conditioned to Meth, the conditional/
reinforcing stimulus substitutes for the drug during the
withdrawal phase while simultaneously driving rhythmic
rest/activity cycles, which otherwise would remain dis-
turbed. This, however, requires the conditional stimulus
(exercise) to be freely accessible. Because circadian rhythm
and sleep stabilization would help decrease addiction
vulnerability and/or reduce risk for relapse in those with
addictive disorders, (72, 73) the proposed treatment in the
current study could be a promising therapeutic approach
to improve rehabilitation.
CONCLUSIONS
The current study demonstrates that concurrent access to
RW is necessary for expression of Meth-induced entrain-
ment in SCNXC3H/HeN mice. This rhythm persistsforat
least 7 d after the end of treatment. These results suggest
that the rhythmicity observed in SCNX mice is a result of
an extra-SCN oscillator and occurs because of the com-
bined reinforcing properties that are garnered from both
Meth and RW. The experimental design of the current
study is a controlled and, likely, more effective treatment
approach for re-establishment and maintenance of physi-
ologic rhythms. This may prove useful in treatment of
cases of severe circadian disruptions or arrhythmicities
produced by drugs of abuse (28) as well as by various
diseases, such as hypothalamic lesions and hypothalamic
gliomas, which suggests that drugs of addiction can be of
therapeutic value if associated and conditioned
properly. Extra-SCN oscillators, such as the MASCO, are
well positioned to be activated, driven, and maintained
with the correct combination of stimuli, which com-
pensates for the loss of a functional SCN as a result of
either disease or ageing.

of rhythmicity by pairing rewarding stimuli.
Meth acts within the mesolimbic system,
which feeds into the MASCO. As a result,
the animal’s motivation to exercise is en-
hanced, which drives the mice to operate
the RW. After multiple exposures of Meth in
conjunction with an RW, the driving prop-
erties of Meth are transferred to the RW.
Once this conditioning is established, rhyth-
mic RW activity will function to drive the
MASCO on a daily basis, which results in
cycling circadian activity.
