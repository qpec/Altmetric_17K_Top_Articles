A core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is 
impairments in social communication and social interaction 
(American Psychiatric Association 2013). Difficulty identi-
fying emotions from other people’s facial expressions may 
contribute to these impairments (Hobson 1995). This idea 
has been supported by studies finding associations between 
the ability to identify facial expressions and social skills in 
individuals with ASD (Wallace et al. 2011; Williams and 
Gray 2012) and studies showing that interventions target-
ing facial expression recognition lead to improvements in 
social skill in children with ASD (Rice et al. 2015; Tho-
meer et al. 2015). However, research aiming to demonstrate 
an impairment in facial expression recognition in individu-
als with ASD has provided mixed results.
While many studies have found evidence for poorer 
recognition of emotions from facial expression in ASD 
(Boraston et al. 2007; Evers et al. 2015; Humphreys et al. 
2007; Lindner and Rosen 2006; Rump et al. 2009), oth-
ers have found no evidence for this difference (Grossman 
and Tager-Flusberg 2012; Jones et al. 2011; Loveland et al. 
1997; Tracy et al. 2011). These mixed findings may be due 
to differences in the tasks used in different studies (Harms 
et al. 2010). Some studies that have found no impairment 
have only tested recognition of emotion from high intensity 
(more exaggerated) expressions (Jones et al. 2011; Tracy 
et al. 2011). Individuals with ASD may use compensa-
tory cognitive or linguistic strategies, rather than automatic 
affective processing, to try to recognise expressions (Gross-
man et al. 2000; Rutherford and McIntosh 2007). These 
compensatory strategies may only be effective when task 
demands are low, allowing for accurate emotion recogni-
tion, but ineffective when tasks demands are higher, for 
example when the emotional expressions are more subtle 
(Rump et al. 2009; Wallace et al. 2011; Wong et al. 2012) 
or presentation times are shorter (Clark et al. 2008).
Abstract It has been proposed that impairments in emo-
tion recognition in ASD are greater for more subtle expres-
sions of emotion. We measured recognition of 6 basic 
facial expressions at 8 intensity levels in young people 
(6–16 years) with ASD (N = 63) and controls (N = 64) via 
an Internet platform. Participants with ASD were less accu-
rate than controls at labelling expressions across intensity 
levels, although differences at very low levels were not 
detected due to floor effects. Recognition accuracy did not 
correlate with parent-reported social functioning in either 
group. These findings provide further evidence for an 
impairment in recognition of basic emotion in ASD and do 
not support the idea that this impairment is limited solely to 
low intensity expressions.

A number of studies have directly compared recogni-
tion of different intensity expressions, testing the idea 
that impairments in recognition are only evident for sub-
tle expressions. Wong et al. (2012) found that children 
with ASD were impaired at recognising photos of expres-
sions rated as low intensity relative to children without 
ASD, but not at recognising photos of expressions rated 
as high intensity. Other studies have tested recognition 
of a larger range of expression intensities by morphing 
neutral expressions with full intensity expressions to cre-
ate sequences of static expressions varying in intensity. 
Using static images from these sequences, Doi et al. 
(2013) found impairment in adults with ASD in labelling 
happiness and sadness at medium intensity levels but not 
high or low intensity levels. A number of studies have 
used intensity sequences to show neutral expressions 
dynamically morphing to reach different intensity levels. 
Using such dynamic sequences, Law Smith et al. (2010) 
found impaired recognition of low intensity, but not high 
intensity expressions of anger and surprise in adults with 
ASD. However, other studies using similar dynamic 
morph sequence stimuli have found no impact of expres-
sion intensity on impairment in emotion recognition from 
facial expressions (Evers et al. 2015; Kessels et al. 2010; 
Ketelaars et al. 2016).
A failure to account for response biases in forced choice 
expression labelling tasks may lead to inconsistent results 
between studies (Evers et al. 2015). Response biases 
towards negative emotions are common in mood disorders 
such as depression and anxiety (Bell et al. 2011; Bourke 
et al. 2010), which often co-occur with ASD (Joshi et al. 
2010). Response biases towards negative emotions have 
also been found in ASD in forced choice labelling tasks 
(Eack et al. 2015; Evers et al. 2015). In real life, expres-
sions are often low intensity and ambiguous, so response 
biases may have a relatively large effect on emotion pro-
cessing in everyday interactions. Testing recognition using 
low intensity expressions allows accurate measurement of 
biases, which can then be accounted for when assessing dif-
ferences in accuracy between groups.
A further methodological reason for the mixed evidence 
for an impairment in emotion recognition in ASD, is that 
many studies in this field lack statistical power. A meta-
analysis of 48 studies of emotion recognition concluded 
that a global impairment did exist (Uljarevic and Hamilton 
2012), but that the effect size for a group difference after 
correction for publication bias was modest (d = 0.4). Pre-
vious studies that have found that the impairment depends 
on the intensity level of the expressions have had very 
small sample sizes (often <20 in the ASD group). Further 
research with larger sample sizes is needed before it can be 
concluded that impairments in emotion recognition in ASD 
are larger for lower intensity expressions.
The current study aimed to compare a group of young 
people with ASD and a typically developing control group 
on recognition of facial expressions from morph sequences 
that vary the intensity of expressed emotion. An online 
testing platform was used in order to collect data from a 
large sample, to ensure sufficient statistical power to detect 
a modest group difference. We hypothesised that there 
would be an impairment in recognition of the 6 basic facial 
expressions in the group with ASD, in comparison to the 
control group (Uljarevic and Hamilton 2012), that was 
greater at lower intensity levels than higher intensity lev-
els (Doi et al. 2013; Law Smith et al. 2010; Wong et al. 
2012). Additionally we hypothesised that emotion recogni-
tion ability would be correlated with parent-reported social 
skills in the ASD group (Wallace et al. 2011; Williams and 
Gray 2012). The protocol for this study was preregistered 
on the Open Science framework (https://osf.io/i6dhf/).
Method
Participants
Participants with ASD were recruited via the Autism Spec-
trum Database UK (http://www.ASD-UK.com), adverts 
placed on autism charity websites, emails to parent sup-
port group mailing lists, visits to parent support group 
meetings, and word of mouth. Control participants were 
recruited via the University of Bristol Cognitive Develop-
ment Centre participant database and word of mouth. All 
participants had to be between 6 and 16 years old, be native 
English speakers and have normal or corrected to normal 
vision. Participants in the ASD group had to have a diag-
nosis given by a professional clinician. Participants in the 
control group had to have no diagnosis of ASD or any 
learning disability, and no first-degree relatives with ASD. 
Parents of all children provided informed consent on the 
study website prior to their child starting the study tasks. 
All participants had their names entered into a prize draw 
to win a tablet computer. The study was approved by the 
University of Bristol Faculty of Science Human Research 
Ethics Committee.
Measures
Emotion Recognition Task (ERT)
The expression recognition task was a forced choice label-
ling task that included faces displaying the 6 basic emo-
tional expressions (happy, sad, angry, disgusted, scared 
and surprised; Ekman 1992) at 8 different intensity levels. 
Stimuli were prototype faces, created by averaging photos 
of 12–15 individuals of the same age and gender posing

the same facial expression using the program Psychomorph 
(Tiddeman et al. 2001). Four different face prototypes were 
produced for each emotion expression: male adult, female 
adult, female child and male child (see Fig. 1). Griffiths 
et al. (2015) provides a detailed description of the crea-
tion of the prototypes including collection of original pho-
tos. For each face prototype an emotionally ambiguous 
expression was created by averaging all expression images 
(Skinner and Benton 2010). These emotionally ambiguous 
expressions were used to create 8-step morph sequences 
running between the ambiguous expression and each full 
intensity emotional expression for each face prototype, 
resulting in 192 stimuli. We chose to create sequences from 
an ambiguous expression rather than a neutral expression 
to ensure that the starting point of the sequences was equi-
distant from all of the emotions in perceptual space. Neu-
tral expressions do not lie at the centre of perceptual face 
space (Shah and Lewis 2003) and are perceived as negative 
rather than emotionally neutral (Lee et al. 2008). Each of 
the 192 stimuli were presented once in the task in a random 
sequence. Stimuli were presented in 4 blocks of 48 trials.
On each trial participants were presented with a fixation 
cross on the screen for a random interval between 1500 and 
2500 ms, followed by the stimulus for 300 ms. This short 
presentation time was chosen to minimise use of compen-
satory strategies and was shown to be acceptable in piloting 
with children with ASD. A visual mask was then presented 
for 150 ms, after which the 6 emotion labels appeared in 
a circular formation on the screen. Participants used the 
curser to respond by selecting the emotional label that 
they thought best described the emotion of the face. The 
labels remained on the screen until the participant made a 
response. The position of the emotion labels was randomly 
selected for each participant but remained consistent for 
that participant throughout the testing session.
Receptive One‑Word Picture Vocabulary Scale
The Receptive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test (ROW-
PVT; Martin and Brownell 2011) is a vocabulary test 
designed for individuals aged from 2 up to 80+ years. The 
test was adapted for online administration with permis-
sion from the publishers. On each trial participants heard 
a recording of a single spoken word and were shown four 
pictures on the screen. Participants used the mouse to 
select the picture that matched the spoken word. Score on

the ROWPVT was used as a covariate in data analyses to 
remove any variance in expression labelling performance 
that could be attributed to verbal ability.
Ravens Progressive Matrices
Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices (RPM; Raven 
et al. 2000) is a 60-item measure of non-verbal reasoning 
designed for a range of ages and abilities. It was adapted for 
online administration with permission from the publishers. 
On each trial, participants were presented with a geometric 
pattern with a piece missing and a choice of 4–6 shapes to 
complete the pattern. Participants used the mouse to select 
the correct shape to complete the pattern. Performance on 
the RPM was used as a covariate in data analyses to remove 
any variance in expression labelling performance that could 
be attributed to non-verbal cognitive ability.
Social Communication Questionnaire (lifetime)
The lifetime version of the Social Communication Ques-
tionnaire (SCQ; Rutter et al. 2003) is 40-item parent-report 
questionnaire that asks about a child’s developmental his-
tory, in order to measure ASD diagnostic traits. Scores 
indicate the likelihood that a child has an ASD. The SCQ 
has been shown to reliably discriminate children with 
ASD from those without ASD within the general popula-
tion (Chandler et al. 2007). Score on the SCQ was used in 
this study to assess the level of autistic traits in each group 
and also to determine whether autistic traits correlated with 
performance on the emotion recognition task.
Procedure
Parents who expressed an interest in their child taking part 
in the study were given a unique password for the study 
website Xperiment (http://www.xperiment.mobi). The 
study website was compatible with desktop or laptop com-
puters but not tablets or phones. Once logged in, parents 
were provided with full information about the study and 
asked to complete the parental consent form. After con-
sent was collected, children could start the study tasks. 
The order of the tasks was constrained so that participants 
first completed the emotion recognition task followed by 
the ROWPVT and finally the RPM. Participants could not 
move on to the next task without completing the previous 
task. Parents were instructed not to look at the screen whilst 
their child was completing the tasks in order to avoid them 
influencing their child’s responses. Participants were able 
to log off in between each task, and to log back in to com-
plete the remaining tasks on separate days. Parents were 
also asked to complete an online questionnaire on a differ-
ent website which included questions about demographics, 
questions to confirm their children’s eligibility for the 
study, and the items of the SCQ. The questionnaire could 
be completed at any point during the study. Parents were 
sent periodic emails to remind them to log in to each site 
and complete any remaining tasks.
Statistical Analysis
The dependent variable in our analysis of emotion recog-
nition accuracy was unbiased hit rate (Hu; Wagner 1993). 
Raw hit rate is affected by any imbalance in participants’ 
tendency to select a particular emotional response. For 
example, if a participant has a bias towards selecting the 
“happy” label, independent of the emotion presented, their 
hit rate for recognition of happiness will be inflated. It is 
therefore important to control for response bias when cal-
culating accuracy in category judgement paradigms. The 
unbiased hit rate transformation was devised to account 
for response bias in category judgement paradigms when 
other methods of adjusting for response bias (i.e. signal 
detection) are unsuitable due to the nature of the catego-
ries. Hu is calculated as: Hu = (Ai/Bi) × (Ai/ Ci), where 
Ai = number of hits, Bi = number of trials where i is target 
and Ci = frequency of i responses (hits and false alarms). 
Analyses were also conducted with raw hit rate as the 
dependent variable, the results of which can be found in the 
supplementary material.
Our primary analysis compared groups on their accu-
racy for recognising each emotion at each intensity level. 
As specified in the preregistered study protocol, this was 
achieved by entering accuracy into a 2 × 6 × 8 mixed model 
ANOVA, with group (ASD, control) as a between-subjects 
factor, and emotion (happy, sad, angry, disgusted, fearful, 
surprised) and intensity level (1–8) as within-subjects fac-
tors. In order to understand any interactions that were sup-
ported by the 3-way ANOVA, we conducted 2-way ANO-
VAs on accuracy for each emotion separately, with group 
and intensity level as factors. Analyses were conducted 
unadjusted and adjusted for ROWPVT, RPM and partici-
pant gender. Where the results do not differ qualitatively, 
statistical values are reported for the adjusted analyses only 
(see supplementary material for values from the unadjusted 
analyses).
The secondary analysis specified in the study protocol 
was a correlation analysis to determine whether partici-
pants’ social functioning, as indexed by their score on the 
SCQ, was associated with overall accuracy on the emo-
tion recognition task. Additionally, given some evidence 
that children with ASD may be more impaired at recognis-
ing emotion on adults faces (Lerner et al. 2013), we tested 
whether the age of the face stimuli differentially affected 
the performance of the two groups by running a 2 × 6 × 2 
mixed model ANCOVA with group as a between-subjects 
 J Autism Dev Disord 
1 3
factor and emotion and face age (child, adult) as within-
subjects factors. Analyses were conducted unadjusted and 
adjusted for ROWPVT, RPM and participant gender (see 
supplementary material for values from the unadjusted 
analyses).
Sample size was based on a power calculation using the 
effect size for a global emotion recognition impairment in 
ASD reported in the meta-analysis by Uljarevic and Ham-
ilton (2012), which was estimated to be d = 0.4 after adjust-
ing for publication bias in the literature. This indicated that 
78 participants would be required in each group to achieve 
80% power, and 108 in each group to achieve 90% power, 
to detect this effect at an alpha level of 0.05.

Results
Participants
We surpassed our recruitment objective, recruiting a total 
of 145 participants with autism and 119 controls. How-
ever, a substantial number of participants dropped out 
after being enrolled (see Fig. 2.). Notably, it was much 
more common for participants with ASD to drop out after 
attempting the ERT. A small number of participants that 
completed the ERT were excluded from the analysis. This 
included five participants with ASD and six without ASD 
who were excluded because their parents did not complete 
the demographics questionnaire, meaning their eligibility 
could not be confirmed. A further two participants with 
ASD and three without ASD were excluded due to ineligi-
bility for the following reasons; visual impairment (N = 1 
with ASD), lack of official ASD diagnosis (N = 1 with 
ASD), first degree relative with ASD (N = 1 without ASD), 
diagnosis of learning disability (N = 2 without ASD). RPM 
and ROWPVT data were missing for some participants due 
to drop-out and technical errors. These participants were 
therefore not included in the main analyses which adjusted 
for these variables, although they were included in the cor-
relational analyses assessing the relationship between SCQ 
and overall performance. This left a total of 63 participants 
with ASD and 64 participants without ASD for the main 
analysis, and 66 participants with ASD and 70 participants 
without ASD for the correlational analysis. Although we 
did not achieve the intended sample size, the achieved sam-
ple size gave us 72% power to detect a difference between 
groups in our main analysis based on the estimated effect 
size from previous research (Uljarevic and Hamilton 2012). 
For those in the final sample, the average number of days 
between completion of the first and final task was 8 days 
(SD = 17 days) for the ASD group and 6 days (SD = 11 
days) for the control group.
Table 1 shows summary statistics for each group for age, 
gender, raw scores on RPM, ROWPVT and SCQ. These 
data suggest that the groups were well matched on age but 
that the ASD group had lower verbal ability and non-verbal 
reasoning ability than the controls. Additionally, there was 
a much higher proportion of males in the group with ASD 
(88%), compared to the control group (50%), as would be 
expected given the higher prevalence rate of ASD in males

than females. As expected, the ASD group scored much 
higher on the SCQ, with 55/66 scoring above the cut-off
 
and 68/70 of the control participants scoring below the 
cut-off for likely ASD diagnosis. All analyses were rerun 
excluding participants with ASD who fell below the cut off 
and control participants who fell above the cut off. Analy-
ses were also rerun including only male participants in both 
groups. Both of these additional analyses showed broadly 
similar results to the analysis of the full sample (see sup-
plementary materials).
All participants in the final ASD group had received 
a diagnosis of an ASD from a paediatrician (58%), clini-
cal psychologist (18%), educational psychologist (12%) 
or other qualified professional. The majority had received 
their diagnosis in a UK National Health Service (88%), 
with a small number receiving a diagnosis at school (6%) 
or from a private clinic (6%). The majority of participants 
were in mainstream education (76%) or in a specialist edu-
cation unit within a mainstream school (14%), with a small 
number attending specialist school (4%), or being home 
educated (6%).
Primary Analysis of ERT Performance
Unadjusted analyses of unbiased hit rate showed clear 
evidence for a main effect of group [F(1, 125) = 15.61, 
p < .001, ɳ2 = 0.030], with the ASD group being less accu-
rate than the control group. However, there was little evi-
dence for this overall group difference once the analysis 
was adjusted for ROWPVT, RPM and participant gender 
[F(1, 125) = 1.48, p = .23, ɳ2 = 0.003]. In both adjusted and 
unadjusted analyses there was strong evidence for main 
effects of emotion [adjusted; F(5, 625) = 141.47, p < .001, 
ɳ2 = 0.146] and intensity [adjusted; F(7, 875) = 472.54, 
p < .001, ɳ2 = 0.435], and for interactions between group 
and emotion [adjusted; F(5,625) = 4.51, p < .001, ɳ2 = 
0.005], group and intensity [adjusted; F(7, 875) = 5.30, 
p < .001, ɳ2 = 0.009], emotion and intensity [adjusted; 
F(35, 4375) = 14.46, p < .001, ɳ2 = 0.046], with some evi-
dence of an interaction between group, emotion and inten-
sity [adjusted; F(35, 4375) = 1.53, p = .023, ɳ2 = 0.005].
Follow up analyses for separate emotions provided 
some evidence for a main effect of group for all emotions 
in the unadjusted analysis [Fs(1,125) > 3.13, ps < 0.079, 
ɳ2 > 0.010] but only for disgust in the adjusted analysis 
[F(1, 125) = 7.68, p = .006, ɳ2 = 0.025, all others; Fs(1, 
125) < 1.04, ps > 0.31, ɳ2 < 0.004]. In both analyses there 
was strong evidence of a main effect of intensity for all 
emotions [adjusted; Fs(7, 875) > 54.59, ps < 0.001, ɳ2 > 
0.213]. Crucially, in both adjusted and unadjusted analy-
ses, there was evidence for interactions between group and 
intensity for anger [adjusted; F(7, 875) = 2.58, p = .012, ɳ2 
= 0.013], disgust [adjusted; F(7, 875) = 5.90, p < .001, ɳ2 
= 0.027], sadness [adjusted; F(7, 875) = 3.24, p = .002, ɳ2 
= 0.017] and surprise [adjusted; F(7, 875) = 2.06, p = .046, 
ɳ2 = 0.010], weak evidence for happiness [adjusted; F(7, 
875) = 1.72, p = .10, ɳ2 = 0.008], but no clear evidence for 
fear [adjusted; F(7, 875) = 1.07, p = .38, ɳ2 = 0.005].
From inspection of the data in Fig. 3, it is clear that 
recognition of the lowest intensity expressions of all emo-
tions was very poor in both groups. Interactions between 
group and intensity in our main analysis may therefore have 
been driven by floor effects that preclude the detection of 
group differences in accuracy at the lowest intensity lev-
els. We therefore carried out a follow up analysis, in which 
we reran the adjusted ANOVA only including the highest 
6 intensity levels, to test whether the interactions between 
group and intensity were being driven by floor effects at the 
lowest two intensity levels.
The reanalysis did not provide strong evidence for an 
interaction between group and intensity [F(1, 625) = 1.57, 
p = .166, ɳ2 = 0.002] or group, emotion and intensity 
[F(25, 3125) = 1.24, p = .187, ɳ2 = 0.004], suggesting 
that interactions between group and intensity in the main 
analyses were likely being driven by floor effects at very 
low intensity levels. There was still no clear evidence for 
a main effect of group [F(1, 125) = 1.44, p = .232, ɳ2 = 
0.003], but there was clear evidence of a two-way interac-
tion between group and emotion [F(5, 625) = 4.54, p < .001, 
ɳ2 = 0.007]. As in the full analysis, there was evidence for 
a main effect of emotion [F(5, 625) 137.04, p < .001, ɳ2 = 
0.172), and intensity [F (5,625) = 232.50, p < .001, ɳ2 = 
0.225] and for an interaction between emotion and intensity 
[F(25,3125) = 6.17, p < .001, ɳ2 = 0.018].
In order to determine what was driving the group by 
emotion interaction in this reanalysis, we collapsed the 
data across the 6 intensity levels and compared group per-
formance for each emotion in between-subjects t-tests. 
These provided good evidence for a group difference for 
anger [t(125) = 2.10, p = .003], disgust [t(125) = 5.56, 
p < .001], happiness [t(125) = 3.27, p = .001] and sadness 
[t(125) = 3.63, p < .001], and weak evidence for a group 
difference for surprise [t(125) = 1.92, p = .057] and fear 
[t(125) = 1.86, p = .065]. Taken together these results sug-
gest that participants with ASD are less accurate than con-
trols at recognising emotions from expressions at various 
intensity levels, once the expressions are intense enough to 
allow performance beyond floor levels.
To explore whether there were any systematic group dif-
ferences in error patterns, we calculated a confusion matrix 
for responses for each emotion (collapsed across all 8 inten-
sity levels) for each group (see Fig. 4). Visual inspection 
of the data suggests that the ASD and control group show 
very similar confusion patterns. This was confirmed using 
a Chi-squared test comparing the two groups’ average

number of misattributions of each emotion label, which 
provided no evidence for a difference between groups 
[χ2(5) = 0.69, p = .98].
Correlational Analysis
There was no clear evidence for the predicted negative cor-
relation between overall accuracy on the emotion labelling 
task and score on the SCQ in either the ASD group (rs = 
−0.043, p = .73) or the control group (rs = −0.092, p = .45), 
suggesting no strong relationship between emotion recogni-
tion ability and parentally-assessed level of social function-
ing using the SCQ in either group.
Face Age Manipulation Check
We found no evidence for critical interactions between face 
age and diagnostic group (ps > 0.66) suggesting that face 
age did not differentially influence the performance of the 
two groups for recognition of any emotion.
Discussion
We found that children and adolescents with ASD were 
less accurate than controls at recognising emotion from 
intense as well as more subtle expressions. However, we 
did not find evidence for a group difference in recogni-
tion of expressions at very low intensity levels due to floor 
effects. The difference in performance between groups was 
evident for all basic emotions although the statistical evi-
dence for a group difference was weaker for recognition 
of fear and possibly surprise. For fear, accuracy was low 
in both groups, even at the higher intensity levels, suggest-
ing the lack of group difference here may be due to poor 
performance in both groups. The current results therefore 
corroborates the existence of a small but broad impairment 
in recognition of basic emotions in ASD (Uljarevic and 
Hamilton 2012), which is present across different intensity 
expressions, once performance rises above floor levels.
We had predicted that we would find a smaller impair-
ment in the ASD group for recognition of high intensity 
expressions compared to more subtle, low or intermediate 
intensity expressions. Instead, we found that intensity did

not have a large influence on the group differences, once 
performance on very low intensity expressions, where rec-
ognition was very poor in both groups, had been excluded. 
Finding a lack of group difference at very low levels is 
unsurprising given these expressions are highly ambigu-
ous. Previous studies that have used expressions that vary 
in intensity have found no group differences in recognition 
at very low intensity levels for the same reason (Doi et al. 
2013). However, based on previous research, we expected 
that the group difference that appeared at intermediate lev-
els might reduce as the expression increased in intensity 
(Doi et al. 2013; Law Smith et al. 2010; Wong et al. 2012). 
Our results are however, consistent with another recent 
study that found an impairment in recognition of basic 
emotions from dynamic expression sequences that was con-
sistent across different intensity levels (Evers et al. 2015). 
Notably, that study and the current study both have sample 
sizes over twice as large as the previous studies that found 
a reduction in impairment in recognition of high intensity 
expressions. Based on these results we suggest that the 
issue of intensity may not be as important a factor in rec-
ognition impairment in ASD as has previously been sug-
gested, and that previous evidence of a moderating effect 
of intensity reflects the combination of a lack of statistical 
power to consistently detect a subtle deficits and floor/ceil-
ing effects on performance.
There are, however, a number of factors to consider 
before dismissing the issue of expression intensity influ-
encing emotion recognition impairment in ASD com-
pletely. First, it is difficult to directly compare intensity 
levels across studies. Even full intensity expression (some-
times referred to as 100% intensity) has not been objectiv-
ity matched. It is therefore possible that the ‘high’ inten-
sity expressions in this study may have been similar to the 
‘medium’ intensity levels in previous studies. If we had 
extended the morph sequences to include more exagger-
ated expressions we may have eventually found a reduc-
tion in impairment. Second, good performance in groups 
with ASD at high intensity levels is attributed to cogni-
tive or linguistic compensatory strategies that are effective 
only at high intensity levels and take longer to implement 
than automatic affective processing (Clark et al. 2008; Doi 
et al. 2013; Grossman et al. 2000; Rutherford and McIn-
tosh 2007). The short presentation times used in this study 
(300 ms) may have prevented the use of such compensatory 
strategies, revealing impairments in recognition even for 
relatively high intensity expressions. Future studies could 
vary intensity and presentation time to determine if these 
two factors interact to predict performance of individuals 
with ASD.
We found that the group with ASD produced a very 
similar pattern of errors to the control group (see Fig. 4). 
Both groups frequently confused disgust and anger for 
each other, and mistook fear for surprise, a confusion pat-
tern that is common in forced choice expression labelling 
tasks in typically developing individuals (Dalrymple et al. 
2013). The similarity of group response patterns suggests 
that there is no systematic response bias at a group level 
that causes reduced accuracy in recognition in ASD. Two 
recent studies have suggested a bias towards particular neg-
ative emotions among adults (Eack et al. 2015) and chil-
dren (Evers et al. 2015) with ASD. In contrast, our results 
align with a number of other studies that have found no 
evidence for differences in confusion patterns (Jones et al. 
2011; Wallace et al. 2011; Wong et al. 2012), suggesting 
that those with ASD are generally using the same types of 
cue to identify emotion from expressions, even if they are 
slightly less accurate in doing this (Wallace et al. 2011).
Unexpectedly we did not find a meaningful correla-
tion between overall performance on the emotion recog-
nition task and social functioning, as measured by parent 
Fig. 4  Confusion matrices of mean number of responses in each 
emotion category for stimuli showing each emotion, for the ASD 
group (top) and control group (bottom)

responses to the lifetime version of the Social Commu-
nication Questionnaire. This is somewhat surprising as 
many other studies have found evidence for a relationship 
between emotion recognition performance and social func-
tioning using similar measures (Evers et al. 2015; Wallace 
et al. 2011; Williams and Gray 2012). However, we did not 
power this study to look for this correlation, and, given that 
the relationship was in the correct direction, it is possible 
that there is a small correlation between emotion recogni-
tion and social functioning that we did not find statistical 
evidence for due to a lack of statistical power.
A substantial limitation of this study is that we did not 
achieve the intended sample due to an unexpected degree 
of participant attrition during testing. Thirty percent of 
participants with ASD dropped out after starting the emo-
tion recognition task, which is more than one might have 
expected had this been a laboratory-based task. It is not 
entirely clear why this was the case, but perhaps partici-
pants are more motivated to continue with a task that is 
repetitive or difficult if they are in a laboratory environment 
rather than at home. This is a potential concern as it may 
mean that those who found the task harder were less likely 
to continue with the task, reducing the size of the impair-
ment that we found. Nonetheless, despite the drop out, we 
still achieved 72% power to detect a difference between 
groups. This study is still one of the larger studies to look 
at emotion recognition in young people with ASD, and the 
largest to look at the effect of expression intensity on the 
recognition impairment.
A further limitation is that, due to testing online, were 
not able to formally confirm diagnosis with gold standard 
diagnostic measures (e.g., autism diagnostic observation 
schedule; ADOS; Lord et al. 2000). However, participants’ 
parents reported that they had a diagnosis of ASD from a 
qualified professional. Given there was no great financial 
incentive to take part, we feel it is unlikely that parents 
would have misreported their child’s diagnosis. Further-
more, we reanalysed our results, removing those who did 
not score above the cut off for ASD on the SCQ (e.g., those 
who arguably were the least likely to have a reliable diag-
nosis) and this did not change our results.
The gender ratios in our groups were not equivalent 
as our group with ASD was predominantly (88%) male, 
while our control group had an equal gender ratio. This 
may have influenced our results, as females have been 
shown to perform better at emotion recognition tasks 
(Thompson and Voyer 2014). We included gender in 
our analysis to adjust for unequal gender ratios between 
groups, as is common in studies of emotion recognition 
where groups have unequal gender ratios (for example; 
Anderson et al. 2011). However, the evidence for a group 
difference in the adjusted analysis was weaker than in 
the adjusted analysis, suggesting that gender may have 
accounted for some of the difference in emotion recogni-
tion accuracy between the ASD and control group.
The current study is one of the first to carry out cog-
nitive testing of this age group with a diagnosis of ASD 
over the Internet (see Sucksmith et al. 2013 for an exam-
ple of online testing of emotion recongition in adults with 
ASD). Despite piloting the study procedure carefully and 
adding in measures to limit potential concerns (such as 
instructions to reduce parental influence), we cannot be 
certain of the reliability of Internet testing in this popula-
tion. However, internet testing has been shown to be reli-
able for perception experiments in the typical population 
(Germine et al. 2012) and the fact that we found results 
that were broadly in line with the results of a meta-anal-
ysis of laboratory studies (Uljarevic and Hamilton 2012) 
gives us confidence in the validity of our Internet-based 
tasks.
Online testing has several advantages over testing in 
the laboratory. Participants can be recruited from across 
a large geographical area, increasing the pool of potential 
participants and therefore sample size (as long as drop 
out can be limited). Furthermore, and perhaps of par-
ticular relevance in research with individuals with ASD, 
participants can complete the study in comfortable and 
familiar surroundings, potentially increasing participa-
tion of a subset of the population who would be uncom-
fortable coming in to the lab. These advantages must be 
weighed up against the potential disadvantages of greater 
attrition in online tasks compared to lab based tasks, and 
the use of parent or self-reported ASD diagnosis, rather 
than gold standard diagnostic assessments.
In conclusion, this study provides further evidence 
that there is a small reliable impairment in recogni-
tion of basic facial expression in ASD that is evident 
when expressions are presented for limited durations. 
The impairment is consistent across different intensity 
levels, once expressions are intense enough to allow 
performance above floor levels. This is at odds with 
the idea that there is a particular deficit in recognition 
of low intensity expressions (Wong et al. 2012). Train-
ing schemes for improving emotion recognition in ASD 
should therefore include full intensity basic expressions, 
perhaps presented only briefly, as well as more subtle or 
complex emotions that might allow generalisation to the 
complexity of real social interactions.
