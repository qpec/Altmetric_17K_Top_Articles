Effect of deoxyribonuclease I treatment for
dementia in end-stage Alzheimer’s disease:
a case report
Victor Tetz1 and George Tetz2*
Abstract
Background: Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by a progressive loss of
brain tissue leading to amyloid-β accumulation and severe decline in cognitive function. The cause of Alzheimer’s
disease is poorly understood, and available treatments are limited in their efficacy, particularly for patients with
more severe symptoms.
Case presentation: We report the case of a 77-year-old Caucasian man with severe dementia and behavioral disturbance
secondary to Alzheimer’s disease treated with memantine who began adjunct treatment with deoxyribonuclease I.
Prior to initiation of deoxyribonuclease I treatment, our patient appeared to be in a stuporous state, with a Mini-Mental
State Examination score of 3 and a Functional Assessment Staging Test score of 7. After obtaining informed consent
from family members, we started administration of 120 mg of deoxyribonuclease I per day (1500 KU/mg) for treatment
of severe cognitive impairment.
Conclusions: Our patient began to demonstrate rapid, considerable improvement in cognitive function 2 days
following initiation of deoxyribonuclease I treatment. After 2 months of continued treatment, Mini-Mental State
Examination and Functional Assessment Staging Test scores were 18 and 4, respectively.

Background
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable, terminal illness
characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and cog-
nitive decline, accounting for roughly 60 to 80 percent
of dementia cases [1]. More than 30 million people suf-
fer from AD, and the number of patients is predicted to
double every 20 years unless preventive measures are de-
veloped [2, 3]. The etiology of AD remains unclear; how-
ever, the characteristic accumulation of amyloid-β is
likely associated with both genetic and environmental
factors [4, 5].
Though several medications have been approved to
treat the symptoms of Alzheimer’s (donepezil, rivastig-
mine, memantine, and galantamine), there is no cure for
the underlying condition, and the current therapeutic
strategies often provide merely temporary relief from
symptoms and exhibit poor efficacy in patients with
moderate to severe AD [6].
The present report details the case of a patient with
severe end-stage AD who experienced significant symp-
tomatic improvement upon treatment with deoxyribo-
nuclease I (DNase I), an enzyme responsible for the
cleavage of both human and microbial DNA, including
cell-free DNA (cf-DNA). Therapeutic DNase I is a puri-
fied solution of recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
for the treatment of abnormal sputum viscosity in pa-
tients with cystic fibrosis [7]. As DNase I is an endo-
nuclease, it has been suggested to have a beneficial role in
the treatment of cancer; however the anticancer mechan-
ism of action is not completely understood [8, 9].
Case presentation
A 77-year-old Caucasian man was diagnosed with de-
mentia secondary to late-onset Alzheimer’s disease 30
months prior to his presentation at clinic, exhibiting

 behavioral disturbances, cognitive decline, and decreased
ability to engage in activities of daily living. Approxi-
mately 14 months following the initial diagnosis, our pa-
tient began treatment with 10 mg of memantine per day
[10, 11], though his cognitive condition continued to de-
teriorate, rapidly progressing to include such behavioral
changes as aggressiveness and disinhibition, in addition
to progressive amnesic syndrome, aphasia, bradykinesia,
shuffling gait, loss of balance, and urinary incontinence.
Further, our patient experienced a 20-pound weight loss,
which is ordinarily indicative of poor prognosis in pa-
tients with AD [12, 13]. Analysis of cranial magnetic res-
onance imaging (MRI) scans revealed age-appropriate
losses in volume and mild changes to the periventricular
white matter (Fig. 1).
Thirteen months following initiation of memantine
treatment, our patient’s total scores on the Mini-Mental
State Examination (MMSE) and Functional Assessment
Staging Test (FAST) were 10 and 5 points, respectively.
He lost points on orientation to time and place, atten-
tion, memory, and visuospatial construction, and our pa-
tient was noticeably slower in completing the tasks.
He experienced additional difficulty in navigating
turns and corners when walking, resulting in recurrent
falls, and exhibited fluctuating levels of consciousness,
alternating between periods of frank confusion and lu-
cidity. However, he experienced no visual or auditory
hallucinations.
A further 3 months later, and a total of 16 months
following
initiation
of
memantine
treatment,
our
patient's experienced further deterioration of cognitive
function. Our patient had fluctuating level of con-
sciousness. His cognition fluctuated between periods of
frank confusion and lucidity, however he had no visual
or audial hallucinations.
He was unable to remember his name, the calendar date,
day of the week, year, or place, and could not recognize
family members. Additional impairments included slurred
speech, expressive aphasia, loss of bowel/bladder control,
and lack of coordination marked by an inability to sit,
stand, or walk unassisted. Our patient became unrespon-
sive to stimuli, with an MMSE score of 3 and a FAST score
of 7. One month later, our patient’s relatives provided in-
formed consent for treatment with 40 mg of human re-
combinant DNase I (1500 KU/mg) given orally three
times a day in conjunction with his continued memantine
therapy (10 mg daily). The DNase I was well tolerated, and
no averse or unanticipated events were registered.
Our patient demonstrated considerable cognitive im-
provement beginning on the second day of DNase I
treatment, becoming partially oriented to time and place,
and once again recognizing and remembering the names
of family members. He further became able to dress
himself, including tying shoelaces and buttons, as well as
walk independently, feed himself, and use an exercise
bike. Neurologic abnormalities affecting his gait were
significantly reduced. His MMSE score increased dra-
matically from 3 to 16, and his FAST score was reduced
from 7 to 5. However, he continued to score low on the
MMSE for measures of orientation to time and place,
memory, and visuospatial construction.
Two months following the initiation of DNase I treat-
ment (19 months following initiation of memantine treat-
ment), our patient exhibited an MMSE score 18 and a
FAST score of 4. Moderate improvements in memory were
observed, although visuospatial construction continued to
decline. He was better able to speak and interact with
others, recognize relatives, and actively attend to television
programs. Our patient further became able to perform cal-
culations, play piano, chess, and walk independently.

 Conclusions
Treatment with DNase I in the present case allowed our
patient to withdraw from a terminal state and resulted in
significant improvements in cognitive and behavioral
function, including the ability to walk and perform every-
day tasks with near independence. DNase I was used as a
repurposed FDA-approved medication [14]. Significant re-
covery was observed in all areas of cognitive and motor
function, indicating the possibility of a DNase-sensitive
target involved in generating the symptoms of AD.
Cell-free DNA, including bacteria-derived DNA, may
be one such target [15]. Circulating cf-DNA has been
observed to play an important role in the progression
and maintenance of different disease states, including
cancer, stroke, and other [16, 17]. Our previous research
revealed its possible role as a therapeutic target in graft-
versus-host diseases [18].
Though there are various suggestions regarding the or-
igins of serum and plasma cf-DNA, many researchers
have speculated that it results from apoptosis, necrosis,
or both, or that this cf-DNA is secreted by cancer cells,
microorganisms, hematopoietic cells, and/or neutrophils
[19]. However, the physiological role of cf-DNA in the
progression of these diseases remains to be discovered.
Some have theorized that this role is mechanical in na-
ture, increasing blood viscosity and leading to ischemia,
while others suggest that cellular uptake of cf-DNA is
involved in the development of metastatic conditions
[20]. Little research has focused on the role of cf-DNA
in neurodegenerative conditions, particularly AD. Fur-
ther studies are required in order to evaluate the role of
cf-DNA in the incidence and progression of neurode-
generative pathologies.
