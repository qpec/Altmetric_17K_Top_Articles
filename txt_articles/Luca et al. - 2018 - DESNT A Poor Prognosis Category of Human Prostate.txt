Abstract
Background: A critical problem in the clinical management of prostate cancer is that it is
highly heterogeneous. Accurate prediction of individual cancer behaviour is therefore
not achievable at the time of diagnosis leading to substantial overtreatment. It remains
an enigma that, in contrast to breast cancer, unsupervised analyses of global expression
profiles have not currently defined robust categories of prostate cancer with distinct
clinical outcomes.
Objective: To devise a novel classification framework for human prostate cancer based
on unsupervised mathematical approaches.
Design, setting, and participants: Our analyses are based on the hypothesis that previ-
ous attempts to classify prostate cancer have been unsuccessful because individual
samples of prostate cancer frequently have heterogeneous compositions. To address this
issue, we applied an unsupervised Bayesian procedure called Latent Process Decompo-
sition to four independent prostate cancer transcriptome datasets obtained using
samples from prostatectomy patients and containing between 78 and 182 participants.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Biochemical failure was assessed using
log-rank analysis and Cox regression analysis.
Results and limitations: Application of Latent Process Decomposition identified a
common process in all four independent datasets examined. Cancers assigned to this
process (designated DESNT cancers) are characterized by low expression of a core set of
45 genes, many encoding proteins involved in the cytoskeleton machinery, ion transport,
and cell adhesion. For the three datasets with linked prostate-specific antigen failure

 1. 
Introduction
Risk categories based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA),
Gleason score, and Clinical Stage that predict PSA failure
[1], underpin the treatment of localized prostate cancer, as
illustrated, for example, by the UK National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence guidelines [2]. Attempts to
improve risk stratification have been made with the devel-
opment of prognostic tests, such as Prolaris [3], Oncotype
DX [4], and Decipher [5]. Most such expression-based prog-
nostic signatures for prostate cancer have in common that
they were derived using supervised steps, involving either
comparisons of aggressive and nonaggressive disease [5,6],
or the selection of genes representing specific biological
functions [3,7,8]. Alternatively, expression biomarkers may
be linked to the presence of somatic copy number variations
[9]. In contrast, for breast cancer, unsupervised analysis of
transcriptome profiles, using approaches such as hierarchi-
cal clustering has identified robust disease categories that
have distinct clinical outcomes and that require different
treatment strategies [10].
Our hypothesis is that completely unsupervised classifi-
cation of prostate cancer based on transcriptome data has
not been successful previously [9,11] because individual
samples of prostate cancer can contain more than one
contributing lineage [12,13] and frequently have heteroge-
neous compositions [14–16]. To test this idea, in the current
study, we applied Latent Process Decomposition (LPD)
[17,18]. Based on the latent Dirichlet allocation method
[19], LPD assesses the structure of a dataset in the absence
of knowledge of clinical outcome or biological role [17]. In
contrast to standard unsupervised clustering models (eg,
k-means and hierarchical clustering), individual cancers are
not assigned to a single cluster: instead gene expression
levels in each cancer are modelled via combinations of
latent processes. We previously used LPD to confirm the
presence of basal and ERBB2 overexpressing categories in
breast cancer datasets [17], and to show that, based on blood
expression profiles, patients with advanced prostate cancer
can be stratified into two clinically distinct groups [20].
2. 
Materials and methods
2.1. 
The CancerMap dataset
Fresh prostate cancer specimens were obtained and processed from a
systematic series of patients who had undergone a prostatectomy
at the Royal Marsden National Health Service Foundation Trust and
Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge as previously described [9,21,22].
The relevant local Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained.
Expression profiles were determined and data was processed as previ-
ously described [22] using 1.0 Human Exon ST arrays (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data are
available from the Gene Expression Omnibus: GSE94767. CancerMap
patients did not receive neo-adjuvant treatment.
2.2. 
Additional transcriptome datasets
We analysed 
five prostate cancer 
microarray 
datasets 
that will
be referred to as: Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC),
CancerMap, CamCap, Stephenson, and Klein. The data used, platforms,
and location of clinical data are presented in Fig. 1B. Each dataset was
obtained using samples from prostatectomy patients. The CamCap data-
set used in our study was produced by combining Illumina HumanHT-12
V4.0 expression beadchip (bead microarray) datasets (GEO: GSE70768
and GSE70769) obtained from two prostatectomy series (Cambridge and
Stockholm) and consisted of 147 cancer and 73 normal samples [9]. The
CamCap and CancerMap datasets have 40 patients in common and thus
are not independent. One RNAseq dataset consisting of 333 prostate
cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was analysed which we
refer to as TCGA [13]. The counts per gene supplied by TCGA were used.
2.3. 
LPD
LPD [17,18], an unsupervised Bayesian approach, was used to classify
samples into subgroups called processes. We selected the 500 probesets
with greatest variance across the MSKCC dataset for use in LPD. These
probesets map to 492 genes. For each dataset, all probesets that map to
these genes were used in LPD analyses (CancerMap: 507 probesets,
CamCap:483, Stephenson: 609).
LPD can objectively assess the most likely number of processes. We
assessed the hold-out validation log-likelihood of the data computed at
various number of processes and used a combination of both the uniform
(equivalent to a maximum likelihood approach) and nonuniform
data following prostatectomy, patients with DESNT cancer exhibited poor outcome
relative to other patients (p = 2.65 � 10�5, p = 4.28 � 10�5, and p = 2.98 � 10�8). When
these three datasets were combined the independent predictive value of DESNT mem-
bership was p = 1.61 � 10�7 compared with p = 1.00 � 10�5 for Gleason sum. A limitation
of the study is that only prediction of prostate-specific antigen failure was examined.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the existence of a novel poor prognosis category
of human prostate cancer and will assist in the targeting of therapy, helping avoid
treatment-associated morbidity in men with indolent disease.
Patient summary: Prostate cancer, unlike breast cancer, does not have a robust classifi-
cation framework. We propose that this failure has occurred because prostate cancer
samples selected for analysis frequently have heterozygous compositions (individual
samples are made up of many different parts that each have different characteristics).
Applying a mathematical approach that can overcome this problem we identify a novel
poor prognosis category of human prostate cancer called DESNT.

 (missed approach point approach) priors to choose the number of
processes. For robustness, we restarted LPD 100 times with different
seeds, for each dataset. Out of the 100 runs we selected a representative
run that was used for subsequent analysis. The representative run, was
the run with the survival log-rank p-value closest to the mode. For the
Klein dataset, for which we do not have clinical data, we used the hold-
out log-likelihood from LPD instead.
2.4. 
Statistical tests
All statistical tests were performed in R version 3.2.2 (https://www.
r-project.org/). Correlations between the expression profiles between
two datasets for a particular gene set and sample subgroup were
calculated as follows:
1. For each gene we select one probeset at random;
2. for each probeset we transformed its distribution across all samples to
a standard normal distribution;
3. the average expression for each probeset across the samples in the sub-
group is determined, to obtain an expression profile for the subgroup;
4. the Pearson’s correlation between the expression profiles of the
subgroups in the two datasets is determined.
Differentially expressed probesets were identified using a moderated
t-test implemented in the limma R package [23]. Genes are considered
significantly differentially expressed if the adjusted p-value was below
0.01 (p values adjusted using the false discovery rate).
Survival analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards
models, the log-rank test, and Kaplan-Meier estimator, with biochemical
recurrence after prostatectomy as the end point. When several samples
per patient were available, only the sample with the highest proportion
of tumour tissue was used. Multivariate survival analyses were

Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) datasets divided the samples into eight processes, each represented here by a bar chart. Samples are
represented in all eight processes and height of each bar corresponds to the proportion (pi) of the signature that can be assigned to each LPD process.
Samples are assigned to the LPD group in which they exhibit the highest value of pi. LPD was performed using the 500 gene probes with the greatest
variation in expression between samples in the MSKCC dataset. The process containing DESNT cancers is indicated. (B) List of datasets used in LPD

 performed with the clinical covariates Gleason grade (� 7 and > 7),
pathological stage (T1/T2 and T3/T4) and PSA levels (� 10 and > 10).
We modelled the variables that did not satisfy the proportional hazards
assumption (T-stage in MSKCC), as a product of the variable with the
heavy-side function:
gðtÞ ¼
1; if t � t0
0; otherwise
(
where t0 is a time threshold. The multiplication of a predictor with the
heavy-side function, divides the predictor into time intervals for which
the extended Cox model computes different hazard ratios. Before carry-
ing out multivariate analyses we assessed collinearity between the
DESNT predictor and the other traditional indicators. To do this we
calculated the variance inflation factor for each covariate in each model.
Variance inflation factor varied between 1.005241 and 1.461661, sug-
gesting a very weak correlation between the predictors.
2.5. 
Deriving an optimal predictor of DESNT membership
To derive an optimal predictor of DESNT membership the datasets were
prepared so that they were comparable: probes were only retained if the
associated gene was found in every microarray platform, only one
randomly chosen probe was retained per gene, and the batch effects
adjusted using the ComBat algorithm [24]. The MSKCC dataset was used
as the training set and other datasets as test sets. Gene selection was
performed using regularized general linear model approach (LASSO)
implemented in the glmnet R package [25], starting with all genes that
were significantly up or down regulated in DESNT in at least two of the
total of five microarray dataset (1669 genes). LASSO was run 100 times
and only genes that were selected in at least 25% of runs were retained.
The optimal predictor was then derived using the random forest (RF)
model [26] implemented in the randomForest R package [27]. Default
parameters were used, apart from the number of trees were set to
10001 and the class size imbalance was adjusted for by down-sampling
the majority class to the frequency of the minority class.

3.1. 
Identification of the DESNT cancer category
Four 
independent 
transcriptome 
datasets 
(designated
MSKCC [11], CancerMap, Klein [28], and Stephenson [29];
Fig. 1B) obtained from prostatectomy specimens were ana-
lysed. LPD was performed using between three and eight
underlying latent processes contributing to the overall
expression profile as indicated from log-likelihood plots
(Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig. 1). Following the independent
decomposition of each dataset, cancers were assigned to
individual processes based on their highest pi value yielding
the results shown in Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. 2. The
pi is the contribution of each process “i” to the expres-
sion profile of an individual cancer: sum of pi over all
processes = 1.
Searching for relationships between the decompositions,
a single process was identified that, based on correlations
of gene expression levels, appeared to be common across
all four datasets (Fig. 1C). To further investigate this
association, for each dataset, we identified genes that
were expressed at significantly lower or higher levels
(p < 0.01 after correction for false discovery rate) in the
cancers assigned to this process compared with all other
cancers from the same dataset. This unveiled a shared set of
45 genes, all with lower expression (Fig. 2A, Supplementary
Table 1). Many of the proteins encoded by these 45 core
genes are components of the cytoskeleton or regulate its
dynamics, while others are involved in cell adhesion and ion
transport (Fig. 2B). Eleven of the 45 genes were members of
published prognostic signatures for prostate cancer (Fig. 2C,
Supplementary data). For example, MYLK, ACTG2, and CNN1
are down-regulated in a signature for cancer metastasis
[30], while lower expression of TPM2 is associated with
poorer outcomes as part of the Oncotype DX signature
[4]. The cancers assigned to this common process are
referred to as “DESNT” (latin DEScenduNT, they descend).
3.2. 
Patients with DESNT cancers exhibit poor prognosis
Using linked clinical data available for the MSKCC expres-
sion dataset we found that patients with DESNT cancer
exhibited poor outcomes when compared with patients
assigned to other processes (p = 2.65 � 10�5, Log-rank test;
Fig. 1D). Validation was provided in two further datasets
where PSA failure data following prostatectomy were avail-
able (Fig. 1D): for both the Stephenson and CancerMap
datasets patients with DESNT cancer exhibited a poor out-
come (p = 4.28 � 10�5 and p = 2.98 � 10�8, respectively).
The number of cancers in each group is indicated in the
bottom right corner of each Kaplan-Meier plot. The number
of patients with PSA failure is indicated in parentheses. In
multivariate analysis, including Gleason sum, Stage, and
PSA, assignment as a DESNT cancer was an independent
predictor of poor outcome in the Stephenson and Cancer-
Map datasets (p = 1.83 � 10�4 and p = 3.66 � 10�3, Cox
regression model) but not in the MSKCC dataset (p = 0.327;

For each dataset comparisons were made between prostate-specific
antigen failures reported for DESNT and non-DESNT cancers. For Latent
Process Decomposition (LPD) the log-rank p-values represent the modal
LPD run selected from the 100 independent LPD runs as described in the
Materials and methods. For multivariate analyses Gleason sum, prostate-
specific antigen at diagnosis and Pathological Stage are included for all
datasets with the exception of the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
dataset where only Gleason sum and Clinical Stage data were available.

 were combined the independent predictive value of DESNT
membership was p = 1.61 � 10�7 (Supplementary Fig. 3),
compared with p = 1.00 � 10�5 for Gleason sum. Including
surgical margin status in the multivariate analysis had little
influence on these values giving p = 3.63 � 10�7 for DESNT
compared to p = 1.80 � 10�5 for Gleason Sum. The com-
bined multivariate model is a significant improvement over
a baseline Cox proportional hazard ratio model containing
Gleason, PSA, and Clinical Stage (p = 9.528 � 10�7; likeli-
hood ratio test). The poor prognosis DESNT process was also
identified in the CamCap dataset [9] (Table 1, Supplemen-
tary Figs. 3 and 4), which was excluded from the above
analysis because it was not independent: there is a substan-
tial overlap with cancers included in CancerMap (Fig. 1B).
3.3. 
A RF classifier for identifying DESNT cancer
We wished to develop a classifier that, unlike LPD, was not
computer processing intensive and that could be applied
both to a wider range of datasets and to individual cancers.
There were 1669 genes with significantly altered expression
between DESNT and non-DESNT cancers in at least two
datasets were selected for analysis. A LASSO logistic
regression model was used to identify genes that were
the best predictors of DESNT membership in the MSKCC
dataset leading to the selection of a set of 20 genes (Sup-
plementary Table 2), which had a one gene overlap (ACTG2)
to the 45 genes with significantly lower expression in
DESNT cancers. Using random forest (RF) classification
these 20 genes provided high specificity and sensitivity
for predicting that individual cancers were DESNT in both
the MSKCC training dataset and in three validation datasets
(Supplementary Fig. 5). For the two validation datasets
(Stephenson and CancerMap) with linked PSA failure data
the predicted cancer subgroup exhibited poorer clinical
outcome in both univariate and multivariate analyses, in
agreement with the results observed using LPD (Table 1,
Fig. 3).
3.4. 
DESNT cancers in TCGA dataset
When RF classification was applied to RNAseq data from
333 prostate cancers described by TCGA [13] a patient sub-
group was identified that was confirmed as DESNT based
on: (1) correlations of gene expression levels with DESNT
cancer groups in other datasets (Supplementary Fig. 6),

cancers compared to non-DESNT cancers (p < 0.01 after correction for false discovery rate). Forty-five genes had lower expression in DESNT cancers in
all four expression microarray datasets, based on a stringency requirement of being down-regulated in at least 80 of 100 independent Latent Process
Decomposition runs. (B) List of the 45 genes according to biological grouping. Previous published evidence is represented as superscripts and the
supporting references are provided in Supplementary Table 1. Encoded protein functions are shown in Supplementary Table 5. Although some of the
45 genes are preferentially expressed in stromal tissue we found no correlation between stromal content and clinical outcome in both the CancerMap
and CamCap patient series, where data on cellular composition were available. When patients were stratified into two groups (above and below
median stromal content) Kaplan-Meier plots failed to show outcome difference for both the CancerMap (Log-rank test, p = 0.159) and CamCap
(p = 0.261) patient series. (c) Relationship between the genes in published poor prognosis signatures for prostate cancer and the DESNT classification

 (2) demonstration of overlaps of differentially expressed
genes between DESNT and non-DESNT cancers with the
core down-regulated gene set (45/45 genes), and (3) its
poorer clinical outcome based on PSA failure (p = 5.4 � 10�4)
compared to non-DESNT patients (Table 1, Fig. 3E).
For the TCGA dataset, we failed to find correlations
between assignment as a DESNT cancer and the presence
of any specific genetic alteration (p > 0.05 after correction
for false discovery rate, x2 test; Fig. 4). Of particular note,
there was no correlation to ETS-gene status (p = 0.136,
x2 test; Fig. 4). A lack of correlation between DESNT
cancers and ERG-gene rearrangement, determined using
the fluorescence in situ hybridization break-apart assay
[31], was confirmed using CancerMap samples (LPD-DESNT,
p = 0.549; RF-DESNT, p = 0.2623, x2 test: DESNT cancers
identified by LPD and by RF approaches are referred to
respectively as LPD-DESNT and RF-DESNT). These observa-
tions are consistent with the lack of correlation between
ERG status and clinical outcome [32], although different
views on the relationship between ERG-gene status and
clinical outcome have been expressed [33]. Since ETS-gene
alteration, found in around half of prostate cancers [13,31]
is considered to be an early step in prostate cancer devel-
opment [15,34] it is likely that changes involved in the
generation of DESNT cancer represent a later event that is
common to both ETS-positive and ETS-negative cancers.
For RF-DESNT cancers in the TGCA series many of the
45 core genes exhibited altered levels of CpG gene methyl-
ation compared to non-RF-DESNT cancers (Supplementary
Table 3) suggesting a possible role in controlling gene

model and have been modelled as time-dependent variables, as described in the Materials and methods.

 expression. Supporting this idea, for sixteen of the 45 core
genes epigenetic down-regulation in human cancer has
been previously reported, including six genes in prostate
cancer (CLU, DPYSL3, GSTP1, KCNMA1, SNAI2, and SVIL;
Fig. 2B, Supplementary Table 1). CpG methylation of five
of the genes (FBLN1, GPX3, GSTP1, KCNMA1, TIMP3) has
previously been linked to cancer aggression.

Discussion
Evidence from The European Randomized study of Screen-
ing for Prostate Cancer demonstrates that PSA screening
can 
reduce 
mortality 
from 
prostate 
cancer 
by 
21%
[35]. However, a critical problem is that the progression
of prostate cancer is highly heterogeneous [36,37] and PSA
screening leads to the detection of up to 50% of cancers that
are clinically irrelevant [38,39]: that is cancers that would
never have caused symptoms in a man’s lifetime in the
absence of screening. Unsupervised analyses of breast
cancer datasets using hierarchical clustering previously
revealed the existence basal, ERBB2-overexpressing and
luminal 
cancer 
categories 
[10]. 
This 
mathematical
approach has not proven successful when applied to pros-
tate cancer microarray datasets [9,11]. However, in our
study the use of LPD, an unsupervised method that takes
into account 
the issue of cancer heterogeneity, has
revealed the existence of a novel category of prostate
cancer, designated DESNT, common across all datasets.
The subsequent linking to clinical data revealed that
DESNT cancers exhibit poor prognosis.
It was notable that membership of the DESNT cancer
groups was not an independent predictor of clinical out-
come in the MSKCC dataset. It is possible that the difference
may simply reflect statistical variation since the size of the
DESNT group in several datasets was small (MSKCC, 13%;
CancerMap, 8%; Stephenson, 31%; Klein, 23%). Critically,
however, when the datasets with linked clinical data were
combined DESNT membership remained an independent
predictor of clinical outcome. We failed to detect systematic
differences between MSKCC and other datasets used in
multivariate analyses (Supplementary Fig. 3H).
We have not, in this study, investigated the biological
function and mechanisms of alterations of expression of the
45 core genes. However, gene down-regulation mediated by
CpG methylation is well documented in human cancer, as is
the association of CpG methylation of single genes with
aggressive cancer behaviour (Supplementary Table 1). The
results found for DESNT cancers are consistent with these
observations, but would suggest that it is the combine
under expression of multiple genes that represents a critical
determinant of cancer progression and aggression. Several
of the genes found to have lower expression in DESNT
cancer (ACTA2, CNN1, LMOD1) encode proteins primarily
expressed in smooth muscle cells or myofibroblast, indica-
tive of an altered tumour-stromal environment. We failed to
find a correlation between stromal content and clinical
Fig. 4 – Comparison of random forest (RF)-DESNT and non-RF-DESNT cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. A 20-gene RF classifier was used to
identify DESNT cancers (designated RF-DESNT cancers). The types of genetic alteration are shown for each gene (mutations, fusions, deletions, and
over-expression). Clinical parameters including biochemical recurrence (BCR) are represented at the bottom together with groups for iCluster,
methylation, somatic copy number alteration (SVNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA) [13]. When mutations and homozygous deletions for each gene were
combined RF-DESNT cancers contained an excess of genetic alterations in BRCA2 (p = 0.021, x2 test) and TP53 (p = 0.0038), but after correcting for
multiple testing these differences were not significant (p > 0.05).

 outcome in the CamCap and CancerMap datasets (Fig. 2).
However, this does not exclude the possibility that DESNT
cancers themselves may have lower stromal content, in part
explaining the lower expression of these genes.
Other under-expressed genes encode components of the
actin cytoskeleton or regulate its dynamics (eg, MLCK, MYL9,
ACTN1, and TNS1). Increased malignancy may correlate with
increased cell migratory behaviour, which in turn can
involve deployment of particular types of cell adhesion
and cytoskeletal machinery [40]. A high dependency on
actomyosin contractility is recognised as a hallmark of
amoeboid movement. Down-regulation of these genes in
DESNT cancers would argue against its involvement. The
lower expression of focal adhesion components such as
integrin a5, vinculin, and integrin-linked kinase, would also
argue against involvement of mesenchymal type migration,
which is dependent on these classes of genes [40]. It is thus
possible that the observed alterations may support involve-
ment of collective migration or expansive growth pheno-
types [40].
Notably, we failed to find any relationship between
DESNT cancers and either copy number variant signatures
(Fig. 2C) or DNA repair gene alterations (Fig. 4). Assignment
of cancers within the DESNT classification framework
together with the use of standard clinical indicators (Stage,
Gleason sum, PSA), copy number variant signatures [11],
expression biomarkers such as Prolaris [3], Decipher [5],
and Oncotype DX [4] identified in supervised analyses and
urine biomarkers [41], should significantly enhance the
ability identify patients whose cancers should be targeted
by radical therapies, avoiding the side effects of treatment,
including impotence, in men with nonaggressive disease. In
future studies, we are focusing on the development of both
LPD- and RF-based tests that can be used to detect DESNT
cancer in biopsy tissue in a clinical setting.
