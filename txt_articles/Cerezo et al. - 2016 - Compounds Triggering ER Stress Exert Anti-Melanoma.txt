SUMMARY
We have discovered and developed a series of molecules (thiazole benzenesulfonamides). HA15, the lead com-
pound of this series, displayed anti-cancerous activity on all melanoma cells tested, including cells isolated from
patients and cells that developed resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Our molecule displayed activity against other
liquid and solid tumors. HA15 also exhibited strong efficacy in xenograft mouse models with melanoma cells
either sensitive or resistant to BRAF inhibitors. Transcriptomic, proteomic, and biochemical studies identified
thechaperoneBiP/GRP78/HSPA5asthespecifictargetofHA15anddemonstratedthattheinteractionincreases
ER stress, leading to melanoma cell death by concomitant induction of autophagic and apoptotic mechanisms.
INTRODUCTION
Cutaneous melanoma is a malignant tumor that develops from
skin melanocytes, the cells responsible for the synthesis of mel-
anins. The development of melanoma occurs in three major
stages: the radial growth phase in which cells proliferate in the
epidermis, the vertical growth phase involving an invasion of
the dermis, and finally the metastatic phase corresponding to a
Significance
Melanoma is one of the most lethal cancers when it reaches the metastatic stage. Despite the spectacular progress made
recently in the treatment of melanoma by using targeted therapies or immunotherapies, most patients with melanoma will
need additional treatments. Using structure/activity relationship studies, we have discovered and developed a series of
molecules (thiazole benzenesulfonamides) exhibiting strong lethal effects in melanoma cells. The lead compound HA15 dis-
plays anti-melanoma effects by targeting the ER stress axis, thereby highlighting the key role of this specific pathway in mel-
anoma malignancy in particular and in cancer in general, and strengthening the idea that ER stress inducers could be useful
in cancer treatment.

 dissemination of the cancer cells in peripheral tissues (Miller and
Mihm, 2006).
Cutaneous melanoma has a high invasive capability and can
rapidly metastasize to other organs. Metastatic melanoma is
one of the most lethal cancers. With an incidence that doubles
every 10 years, melanoma thus constitutes a serious public
health issue. The prognosis of metastatic melanoma is extremely
pejorative. Indeed, at the stage of visceral metastasis, the prog-
nosis is catastrophic with a median survival of 6 months. There-
fore, although melanoma represents only 5% of all cutaneous
cancers, it is responsible for 80% of the deaths associated
with skin cancers (Demierre, 2006). Encouraging results have
recently been obtained with BRAF inhibitors, vemurafenib or
dabrafenib, and with MEK inhibitors (Smalley, 2010). The life ex-
pectancy of patients is increased by about 6 months with use of
these inhibitors (Aplin et al., 2011; Flaherty et al., 2010, 2012).
Regrettably, however, after a short period of remission, mela-
nomas acquire drug resistance, and recurrence of metastases
is observed in almost all cases. Numerous studies have focused
on identifying the resistance mechanisms. These studies have
disclosed the existence of highly heterogeneous processes but
most lead to restoration of MAPK signaling or maintenance of
translation (Boussemart et al., 2014; Goding, 2013; Wong and
Ribas, 2016). Other therapies, anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1, recently
developed to reactivate the anti-tumor immune response of the
patient (Eggermont et al., 2014; Zeiser et al., 2012) result in an
objective and long-lasting response in about 15%–35% of pa-
tients. Nevertheless, despite the recent improvements in mela-
noma treatment, more than 50% of patients will be in treatment
failure. Therefore, identification of a common vulnerability in mel-
anoma cells is an urgent need and will help to discover more
effective treatments of melanoma.
We have previously demonstrated the capacity for molecules
of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) family to induce massive death of
melanoma cell lines (Botton et al., 2009, 2011). TZDs are known
previously for their use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, in
which they activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
g (PPARg), a nuclear receptor of target cells, to increase insulin
sensitivity (Auwerx, 1999). Interestingly, their action on mela-
noma is independent of PPARg activation (Botton et al., 2009).
Based on these results, we initiated a chemistry program aimed
at modifying the structure of the TZDs to eliminate any PPARg
activation properties while maintaining the strong anti-mela-
noma activity.
RESULTS
HA15 Exerts a Deleterious Effect on Melanoma Cell
Viability
By iterative structure-activity studies requiring the synthesis and
testing of a large number of analog molecules, the structure of
TZD was deeply modified and ultimately led to establishing the
lead compound HA15. Figure 1A presents the structures of tro-
glitazone and our lead compound HA15, belonging to the thia-
zole benzensulfonamides. As expected from its structure, which
lacks the TZD moiety, HA15 does not bind or activate PPARg
(data not shown).
The effect of HA15 on human melanoma cell lines was evalu-
ated using the trypan blue exclusion assay. Time course exper-
iments showed that after 6 hr of incubation, HA15 (10 mM)
decreased melanoma cell viability compared with control condi-
tions (DMSO) (Figure 1B). After 48 hr of HA15 treatment, only
3% of melanoma cells were still viable. As shown in Figure 1C,
24 hr exposure to various concentrations of HA15 led to a
dose-dependent decrease in melanoma cell viability. The 50%
inhibitory concentration (IC50) in A375 cells was between 1 and
2.5 mM HA15. HA15 decreased the viability of melanoma cell
lines with different mutational status (Figures 1D and S1). These
results were further confirmed using melanoma cell cultures
freshly isolated from patient tumors with BRAF mutation (pa-
tients 1 and 4), with BRAF and TP53 mutations (patient 2), and
with NRAS mutation (patients 3 and 5, Figure 1E). Importantly,
no deleterious effects on the viability of normal human melano-
cytes or human fibroblasts were observed with low or high doses
of HA15 (10 and 100 mM, respectively; Figure 1F).
HA15 Induces an Early ER Stress
To investigate the signaling pathway involved in the effects of
HA15 on melanoma cells, we performed microarray analysis in
which three different melanoma cell lines, Mel501, SKMel28,
and A375, were treated for 6 hr with 10 mM HA15. Gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed a significant increase in
all three cells lines of genes involved in the unfolded protein
response leading to ER stress, such as EIF2AK3 (PERK), ATF4,
ERN1 (IRE1a), ATF6, DDIT3 (CHOP), and XBP1 (Figure 2A).
Several other genes whose expression was also found to be
increased are involved in apoptosis (JUN, BCL2) or autophagy
(LC3) (data not shown). To characterize the ER stress, we studied
the key players of ER stress by western blot analysis on the
lysate of A375 cells treated for different times with 10 mM HA15
(Figure 2B). After only 1 hr of HA15 treatment, we observed phos-
phorylation of PERK and elF2a and a weak increase in ATF4 and
CHOP expression. After 4 hr of HA15 treatment, the expression
of IRE1a, ATF4, and CHOP had strongly increased, and PERK
and elF2a remained phosphorylated. This increase in expression
and phosphorylation persisted after 24 hr of treatment. The pro-
tein kinase activated by double-stranded RNA (PKR) activation is
generally associated with auto-phosphorylation and electropho-
retic shift. HA15 does not change PKR migration in a western
blot, indicating that HA15 does not activate PKR in melanoma
cells. Therefore, PKR cannot be responsible for eIF2a phosphor-
ylation. In parallel, splicing of XBP1 mRNA was induced after 1 hr
of HA15 treatment, which persisted after 24 hr (Figure 2C). These
results indicate a rapid induction, within 1 hr, of the ER stress
markers by HA15. Furthermore, electron microscopy revealed
that the melanoma cells exposed to HA15 (10 mM) over 12 hr pre-
sented a typical dilated ER cisternae, a classical feature of ER
stress (Figure 2D).
To confirm the involvement of HA15 in the induction of ER
stress, we analyzed the localization of HA15 using auto-fluores-
cence of its dansyl ring and subsequent confocal analysis (Fig-
ure 2E). We observed a strong co-localization between HA15
and ER Tracker. Quantification of 100 individual cells showed
that 82% ± 11% of the HA15 labeling overlapped with that of the
ER Tracker, thus highlighting an interaction of HA15 with the ER.
Finally, we observed that HA15 also induced ER stress in other
melanoma cell lines by the increased expression of PERK,
IRE1a, ATF4, CHOP, and phosphorylation of elF2a (Figure 2F).

 Determination of the Molecular Target of HA15
To determine the molecular target of HA15 within the ER, a
chemical probe was designed allowing streptavidin affinity puri-
fication of the HA15 interactors for proteomic analysis. A biotin
moiety was attached on the amide part of HA15 or of the inactive
compound AM406 (Figure 3A), spaced by a 10 atom linker to
avoid any hindering to the binding between HA15 and its target.
Cell viability assays confirmed similar levels of activity between
HA15-biotin and HA15. AM406-biotin has no effect on cell
viability (Figure S2A).
Lysates of A375 melanoma cells were incubated with HA15-
biotin before being precipitated using streptavidin beads, as
described in the Experimental Procedures. Precipitated biotin-
streptavidin complexes were separated on SDS-PAGE, and the
proteins were then identified using proteomic analysis. Table 1

represents the different proteins found to
interact
specifically
with
HA15-biotin.
Considering the observed dependence on
ER stress of HA15-induced effects, we
focused our attention on proteins that
play a role in this process. Interestingly,
we
identify
the
chaperone
protein
glucose-regulated
protein
78
(GRP78,
also named HSPA5 or binding immuno-
globulin protein BiP), known to play a
pivotal role in ER stress response, as a
direct target of HA15.
To confirm the interaction between
HA15 and BiP, we performed pull-down
assays using HA15-biotin or the inactive
AM406-biotin and recombinant proteins
(IRE1a, ATF6, BiP, and HSP70). HA15
and AM406 biotin derivatives do not
interact with recombinant IRE1a, ATF6, or HSP70 recombinant
proteins (Figure 3B). However, we observed an interaction be-
tween BiP and HA15-biotin, but not with AM406-biotin (Fig-
ure 3B). In parallel, lysates from A375 melanoma cells were
incubated with HA15-biotin, biotin alone, or AM406-biotin before
being precipitated using streptavidin beads and separated on
SDS-PAGE. The precipitated proteins were identified by western
blot using specific antibody (Figure 3C). We found that HA15-
biotin interacts with BiP, but not with PERK, ATF6, IRE1a, or
HSP70. As expected, biotin or AM406-biotin interacts with
none of these proteins, demonstrating therefore a specific inter-
action between BiP and HA15. Similar results were found with
cell lysates from melanoma cells isolated from patients (Fig-
ure S2B), indicating that HA15 and BiP interaction is not
restricted to A375 cells.

 Then, we hypothesized that the interaction between BiP and
HA15 is responsible for the dissociation of BiP with its ER part-
ners, PERK, IRE1a, and ATF6, therefore representing the initial
event necessary to induce the observed ER stress. Co-immuno-
precipitation experiments showed that incubation of melanoma
cell lysates with HA15 decreased the BiP level in the PERK,
IRE1a, and ATF6 immunoprecipitated fractions (Figures 3D
and S2C), thus confirming our hypothesis that HA15 induced a
dissociation of the BiP, PERK, IRE1a, and ATF6 complex. In
other series of experiments of co-immunoprecipitation, we
found that addition of recombinant BiP competes and dimin-
ishes dissociation of endogenous cellular BiP from PERK and
IRE1a (Figure S2D). We next performed an in vitro reconstitution
assay using recombinant BiP and recombinant IRE1a. As pre-
sented in Figure S2E, contrary to the inactive derivative
AM406, HA15 is able to dissociate the complex between BiP
and IRE1a, suggesting a direct effect of HA15 on the complex.
We next used immunofluorescent microscopy to investigate
whether HA15 and BiP co-localized in the cell. As shown in Fig-
ure 3E, HA15 showed a strong co-localization with BiP antibody
and ER Tracker. Quantification of 100 individual cells indicated
that 64% ± 8% of HA15 labeling co-localized with that of BiP,
further supporting an interaction between HA15 with BiP. Fig-
ure S2F indicates that there is no crosstalk between the three
channels. Finally, fluorescence resonance energy transfer anal-
ysis and experiments using differential scanning calorimetry or
isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) confirmed the interac-
tion between BiP and HA15 (Figures S3A–S3C).
All HSP70-family proteins require ATP binding and hydrolysis
to ensure their chaperone function. BiP would therefore be ex-
pected to depend on its functional ATP-binding domain to
induce its unfolded protein response (UPR)-adaptive effect.
The HSP70s bind ATP with high affinity and their ATPase activity,
stimulated by binding to the unfolded protein, catalyzes re-
folding. In contrast to the biphenolic compound honokiol derived
from Magnolia officianalis (Martin et al., 2013), which was
described to interact with BiP, HA15 is able to inhibit the
ATPase activity of BiP in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3F).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that HA15 directly
binds to and inhibits BiP activity. We finally demonstrated that
BiP expression increased during melanoma development (Fig-
ures S3D and S3E; Table S1) and that melanoma cells express-
ing a high level of BiP (e.g., A375 and patient 2) responded to
HA15 better than those expressing a low level of BiP (e.g.,
Skmel28 and patient 5) (Figure S3F).
HA15 Induces Concomitant Autophagy and Apoptosis
Electron microscopic images of A375 cells treated for 24 hr with
HA15 displayed membrane blebs characteristic of apoptotic
cells (Figure 4A). By contrast, the control melanoma cells
(DMSO) showed no autophagic vacuoles or membrane bleb-
bing. HA15-treated cells also displayed an increase in annexin
V labeling (Figure 4B) and a decrease in expression of the anti-
apoptotic protein BCL2 (Figure 4C, upper part). HA15 at 10 mM
strongly increased the levels of the cleaved and activated form
of caspase 9 that initiates apoptosis through the mitochondrial
intrinsic pathway. Concordantly, the zymogenic form of caspase
3 showed reduced levels, indicative of its activation. One of the
best described cellular substrates of activated caspase 3 is
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and stimulation of cells
with 10 mM HA15 led to cleavage of PARP. As expected, the
treatment of cells with the pancaspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH
(QVD, 20 mM) abolished the effect of HA15 on PARP cleavage
(Figure 4C, lower part). Collectively, these data indicate that
HA15 induces apoptosis.
Furthermore, electron microscopy images also showed typical
signs of autophagy, including accumulation of numerous vesi-
cles with a distinct double membrane (Figure 4A). They also dis-
played evidence of early autophagosomes sequestering cytosol,
mitochondria, or ER membranes. These ultra-structural hall-
marks of autophagy led us to investigate whether HA15 might
also induce autophagy. During autophagy, LC3B-I is converted
to LC3B-II through the ATG4-dependent insertion of a phos-
phoethanolamine moiety before being recruited into the mem-
brane of the forming phagophore, a double membrane required
for the recycling of protein aggregates and organelles (Klionsky
et al., 2012). Increased LC3B-II expression was detected after
1 hr of HA15 treatment and persisted after 24 hr (Figure 4D). At
the same time, HA15 also enhanced the expression level of
Beclin 1, a protein required to initiate the formation of the auto-
phagosome in autophagy. Finally, we studied LC3B expression
by immunofluorescence. Melanoma cells treated with HA15
showed a dramatic and sustained increase in LC3B staining
compared with control (Figure 4E). These data were confirmed
by fluorescence quantification and clearly indicate that HA15
also induces autophagy.
Considering that a strong and sustained ER stress can lead to
cell death by apoptosis and sometimes autophagy, we wished to
determine whether the ER stress induced by HA15 is responsible
for apoptosis, autophagy, and finally melanoma cell death. To
this end, we blocked ER stress by inhibiting the expression of
CHOP, a key player in ER stress, using siRNA. As expected,
siRNA against CHOP completely inhibited the expression of
CHOP protein both basally and in response to HA15 (Figure 4F).
The expressions of two proteins upstream of CHOP, PERK, and
IRE1a, were not modified by the siRNA. Interestingly, reduction
of CHOP dramatically inhibited PARP cleavage and the conver-
sion of LC3B-I to LC3B-II. Concomitantly, siCHOP prevented the
decrease in cell viability induced by HA15, demonstrating that
ER stress is responsible for melanoma cell death (Figure 4F).

 Silencing of other ER stress signaling pathway proteins, PERK,
IRE1a, and ATF4 (Figures S4A and S4B), partially reverses the ef-
fect of HA15 on cell viability. As a whole, these results indicate
that apoptosis, autophagy, and finally melanoma cell death are
the consequences of HA15-induced ER stress.
Finally, we studied the respective contribution of apoptosis
and autophagy in the cell death induced by HA15. We thus
blocked apoptosis and autophagy using QVD and siLC3,
respectively. QVD and siLC3B inhibited PARP cleavage and
LC3B expression respectively in the presence or absence of
HA15 treatment. As expected, neither QVD nor siLC3B modified
ER stress induced by HA15, as monitored by the increase in
expression of IRE1a and CHOP. Inhibition of apoptosis or auto-
phagy partially inhibited the cell death induced by HA15,
whereas concomitant inhibition of both completely restored
cell viability (Figure 4G). Taken together, these data indicate
that apoptosis and autophagy act simultaneously in HA15-
induced melanoma cell death.
Interestingly, HA15 did not induce PARP cleavage in normal
melanocytes and normal fibroblasts, suggestive of an absence
of apoptosis (Figure 4H). This is consistent with the absence of
death found in these cells upon HA15 treatment. CHOP was
not detectable in normal cells and HA15 slightly increased
CHOP protein levels in melanocytes but not in fibroblasts. As
expected, HA15 strongly increased the CHOP level in A375 mel-
anoma cells. BiP protein is expressed in fibroblasts but its
expression is not induced by HA15. The slight increase of BiP
in melanocytes is, however, not comparable with the strong in-
crease observed in A375 melanoma cells. These results suggest
that HA15 does not modulate ER stress in normal melanocytes
and fibroblasts, explaining its lack of toxicity in normal cells.
ER stress has also been shown to promote mitochondrial
membrane depolarization and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production. The ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine attenuated
the cell death-inducing effect of HA15 (Figure S4C), suggesting
that ROS induced by ER stress could be involved in the effects
of HA15.
HA15 Inhibits Melanoma Tumor Development in Mice
To assess a potential antineoplastic effect of HA15 in vivo, A375
melanoma cells (1.5 3 106) were injected subcutaneously into
6-week-old female athymic nude mice that were treated
8 days later by injection of vehicle, PLX4032 (0.7 mg/mouse/
day) or HA15 (0.7 mg/mouse/day) over a period of 2 weeks. Un-
treated control mice rapidly developed visible tumors, and we
observed dramatic tumor growth throughout the study (Fig-
ure 5A). In contrast, treatment of mice with PLX4032 or HA15
markedly attenuated the development of tumors. Moreover,
the tumors derived from HA15-treated mice were consistently
and significantly lighter than those from untreated control mice
(Figure 5B). These data clearly demonstrate an anti-melanoma
activity of HA15 in vivo, comparable with PLX4032 at the same
dose. Furthermore, the treatment of mice with HA15 induced
no apparent toxicity and we noted no change in their behavior,
body mass, or liver mass, suggesting an absence of hepatomeg-
aly (Figures 5C and 5D).
We then investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in
the anti-tumorigenic effects of HA15 in vivo. Tumor sections
from mice treated with HA15, and to a much lesser extent with
PLX4032, showed an increase in CHOP staining compared
with control sections. In addition, the evaluation of apoptosis
by TUNEL assay showed increased apoptosis in tumor sections
from mice treated with HA15 compared with those from mice
treated with vehicle or PLX4032 (Figure 5E). Similar results
were found concerning autophagy showing an increase of
LC3B staining as well as LC3B puncta, reminiscent of autopha-
gosome formation in tumor sections from mice treated with
HA15 (Figure 5F). Thus, the reduction in tumor volume and
weight observed in the HA15-treated mice is, at least in part,
the consequence of the induction of ER stress, autophagy, and
apoptosis.
Finally, we evaluated the toxicity in the liver of mice treated
with vehicle, HA15, or PLX4032. H&E staining of the liver of
mice treated by HA15 and PLX showed normal histology when
(D) PERK, IRE1a, and ATF6 were immunoprecipitated overnight from A375 lysates in the presence of DMSO or HA15. Western blotting was performed with
indicated antibodies. One representative experiment of three is shown.

measured from sera of treated mice (Figure 5H) were not
affected by HA15 or PLX4032 treatments, indicating an absence
of hepatic toxicity induced by HA15 treatment.
HA15 Is Able to Induce Death of Melanoma Cells that Are
Resistant to BRAF Inhibitors
As mentioned above, treatment of BRAF V600E melanoma pa-
tients with BRAF inhibitors leads to systemic resistance and
metastasis relapse. We wished to determine the efficacy of
HA15 on melanoma cells resistant to BRAF inhibitors such as
PLX4032. As presented in Figure 6A, HA15 was able to decrease
the viability of A375 melanoma cells that had acquired resistance
to PLX4032, as previously described (Corazao-Rozas et al.,
2013). The HA15 was also able to induce ER stress in these resis-
tant cells, as shown by the increase in CHOP expression. We ob-
tained the same results with SKMel28 and WM9, melanoma cells
resistant to BRAF inhibitor (Figure 6A).
In a more physiopathological approach, we tested our com-
pound on melanoma cells isolated from biopsy samples of
patients whose tumors had acquired resistance to BRAF
inhibitors, PLX4032, or dabrafenib. Contrary to PLX4032 or dab-
rafenib, HA15 demonstrated high efficiency in inducing cell
death and ER stress in BRAF-inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells
(Figure 6B).
Finally, we tested the anti-tumorigenic effect of HA15 in
mice injected with melanoma cells presenting acquired resis-
tance to the BRAF inhibitor PLX4032. Briefly, as previously
described, we subcutaneously injected BRAF-inhibitor-resistant
A375 cells (1.5 3 106) into nude mice, which were then treated,
4 days later, by vehicle, PLX4032 (0.7 mg/mouse/day) or HA15
(0.7 mg/mouse/day). Untreated control mice or PLX-treated
mice rapidly developed dramatic tumor growth throughout the
study (Figure 6C). In contrast, treatment of mice with HA15
markedly attenuated the development of tumors. Moreover, tu-
mors derived from HA15-treated mice were consistently and
significantly lighter than those from the untreated control or
PLX-treated mice (Figure 6D). These data clearly demonstrate
anti-melanoma activity of HA15 in vivo in BRAF-inhibitor-resis-
tant cells. As observed in tumors from BRAF-inhibitor-sensitive
melanoma cells, HA15 induced a dramatic increase in CHOP
staining compared with sections from control mice or mice in-
jected with PLX4032 (Figure 6E). We also observed an increase
in TUNEL-positive cells (Figure 6E) and an increase of LC3B
staining as well as LC3B puncta (Figure 6F) in tumor sections
from mice treated with HA15 compared with those from mice
treated with vehicle or PLX4032.
HA15 Is Able to Induce Death of Cell Lines Derived from
Numerous Other Tumors
Considering that ER stress is increased during the development
of several types of tumors, we wondered whether HA15 could
induce the death of other tumor cells. As presented in Figures
7A and 7B, HA15 treatment led to the death of cell lines derived
from various tumor types. More interestingly, HA15-induced
cell death was observed in cancer cells that are resistant to con-
ventional therapy such as the pancreatic cell line MIA PaCa
(resistant to gemcitabine) or the myeloid leukemia cells, ImaR
(resistant to imatinib).
Finally, we treated six non-melanoma cell lines with HA15 and
determined its effects on ER stress and cell death (Figure 7C).
HA15 induced an increase in CHOP expression and subsequent
ER stress in all cell lines tested. Moreover, HA15 induced
apoptosis (as monitored by PARP cleavage) in all tested cell
lines. However, induction of autophagy (as monitored by conver-
sion of LC3) was observed only on MDA-MB453, HT29, and
MiaPaCa cells.
DISCUSSION
The discovery of therapeutic compounds for treating advanced
melanomas that are resistant to existing therapies is paramount
to further improve patient outcome. In the present report, we
describe a lead compound of the thiazole benzenesulfonamides

 series, denoted as HA15, that displays strong in vitro and in vivo
anti-melanoma properties without toxicity in normal cells, pre-
dicting weak adverse effects of this compound.
The death of melanoma cells induced by HA15 is mediated by
the concomitant induction of autophagy and apoptosis, both of
which are the consequence of a rapid initiation of ER stress.
ER stress activates the UPR signaling network to alleviate such
stress and restore ER homeostasis, thereby promoting cell sur-
vival and adaptation (Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003; Sitia and
Braakman, 2003). However, under irresolvable ER stress condi-
tions, the UPR promotes cell death by triggering apoptosis
and/or autophagy (Heath-Engel et al., 2008; Logue et al., 2013;
Nagelkerke et al., 2014). Inhibition of CHOP, a transcription fac-
tor that is involved in the induction of autophagy and apoptosis
under high levels of ER stress (Szegezdi et al., 2006) prevents
apoptosis and autophagy induced by HA15, thus demonstrating
the causal role of ER stress in the anti-melanoma effect of HA15.
Similarly, inhibition of other ER stress signaling pathway proteins
partially reverses the effect of HA15 on cell viability, suggesting
the effects of HA15 are also PERK/IRE1a dependent.
Autophagy is a catabolic process for the degradation and re-
cycling of macromolecules and organelles, and is activated dur-
ing stress conditions (Meijer and Codogno, 2004; Scarlatti et al.,
2009). It is considered as a survival mechanism induced in
adverse conditions to maintain cell integrity, however, auto-
phagy is also involved in a particular mode of death called type
II cell death (Morselli et al., 2009). Several reports have described
that the induction of autophagy by ER stress in melanoma and
different tumor cells is responsible for their survival (Heath-Engel
et al., 2008; Hoyer-Hansen and Jaattela, 2007; Ma et al., 2014;
Rouschop et al., 2013). On the other hand, prolonged ER stress
and sustained autophagy may eventually lead to cell death.
Interestingly, we observed that the blocking of autophagy by
siRNA directed against LC3B or pharmacological inhibition by
3-methyl adenine (data not shown) restored partial melanoma
cell survival in response to HA15 (approximately 50%). More-
over, during ER stress, PERK activation increases the transcrip-
tion of autophagy genes MAP1LC3B, encoding LC3B, and ATG5
through the transcription factor ATF4 and CHOP, respectively
(Rouschop et al., 2010). In our hands, ATF4 silencing partially
restores cell viability in response to HA15 and decreases
HA15-stimulated LC3B I and II levels, but does not affect
HA15-induced apoptosis. Therefore, ATF4 is involved in HA15-
induced autophagy but not in the induction of apoptosis elicited
by the compound. Simultaneous inhibition of apoptosis and
autophagy completely blocked HA15-induced cell death, sug-
gesting an equal contribution of both cell death mechanisms.
Mass spectrometry analysis of the proteins interacting with
HA15 identified the chaperone BiP that is involved in the initial
step of ER stress. Residing primarily in the ER, BiP belongs to
the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family, which collectively
play critical roles in oncogenic stress. In addition to facilitating
proper protein folding, preventing intermediates clumping and
targeting misfolded proteins for proteasome degradation, BiP
also binds Ca2+ and serves as an ER stress signaling regulator
(Lee, 2007). In non-stressed cells, BiP binds to other ER trans-
membrane sensors PERK, IRE1a, and ATF6 and maintains
them in inactive form. Dissociation of BiP from these protein
complexes activates their corresponding signaling pathways,
sending signals to the nucleus and triggering the UPR (Szegezdi
et al., 2006). The identification of BiP as the target of our com-
pound is a key discovery since this protein was reported to be
the key regulator of chemoresistance. Indeed, the overexpres-
sion of BiP is a common observation in many tumors and clearly
correlates with chemoresistance of several cancers including
melanoma (Ma et al., 2014; Roller and Maddalo, 2013; Shenoli-
kar, 2014). Moreover, several results obtained in chemoresistant
cancers have revealed the upregulation of BiP at both the RNA
and protein expression levels (Guan et al., 2015; Li and Li,
2012; Roller and Maddalo, 2013; Zhuang et al., 2009).
The data in mice associated with the lack of effect in normal
cells (melanocytes and fibroblasts) demonstrate a specificity of
HA15 for melanoma cells and an apparent lack of toxicity. Com-
plementary studies confirming the absence of toxicity of the
compound are ongoing. A higher basal level of ER stress in
melanoma cells compared with normal cells may explain this
interesting observation. By increasing the level of ER stress,
HA15 may allow the threshold required to induce cell death in
cancer cells but not in normal cells to be reached. This hypothe-
sis is consistent with the results indicating that BiP expression
is increased in melanoma cells in comparison with normal
melanocytes.
Considering the role that BiP plays in chemoresistance both
inside and outside the ER, developing therapeutic agents that
directly target and inhibit the pro-survival action of this protein
appears to be an important strategy. Further, we found that mel-
anoma cells that express high levels of BiP in general are more
sensitive to HA15 than are cells that express low levels of BiP,

 but there are clear exceptions. These exceptions may be ex-
plained by the fact that the degree of ER stress is not only
determined by the level of BiP but also by the levels of its client
proteins and downstream effectors that are also critical for the
ER stress response.
One major problem of all known inducers of ER stress medi-
ated by BiP targeting is the presence of major off-target re-
sponses. For example, while honokiol is able to induce apoptosis
in cancer cells (Chen et al., 2010; Martin et al., 2013), it also in-
duces the death of normal fibroblasts, melanocytes, and kerati-
nocytes (data not shown) and is involved in the regulation of
other pathways such as AMPK or Notch1 (Kaushik et al.,
2014a, 2014b). Further, our experiments indicate that unlike
HA15, honokiol is unable to inhibit BiP activity. Another good
example is epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). This compound in-
duces a weak ER stress response by interaction with BiP (Martin
et al., 2013) but is also able to induce other responses such as
inhibition of telomerase and DNA methyltransferase to block
the activation of EGFR and HER2 and inhibition of fatty acid syn-
thase and glutamate dehydrogenase (Khan and Mukhtar, 2008;
Patra et al., 2008; Singh et al., 2011).
The development of resistance to BRAF inhibitors is a major
obstacle in targeted therapy for melanoma. HA15 reduces the
development of melanoma tumors, including those from mela-
noma cells with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor. Therefore,
HA15 is a reasonable candidate for therapeutic evaluation in

 patients whose tumors have acquired resistance to BRAF inhib-
itors. Interestingly, we were unable to generate melanoma
models of HA15 acquired resistance (data not shown) as ob-
tained with BRAF inhibitors (Corazao-Rozas et al., 2013). This
result is not really surprising since HA15 affects a global cellular
mechanism, i.e., ER stress, rather than one specific protein,
as the BRAF inhibitors do. As an increase in ER stress is a
common phenomenon found in most human tumors, we found
that HA15 was also able to induce ER stress and showed a
significant efficiency in all tumor cell lines tested regardless of tu-
mor types, including those from tumors resistant to classical
chemotherapy.
In summary, we demonstrate that HA15 inhibits tumor growth
through autophagic and apoptotic mechanisms initiated by ER
stress. Taking account of the drastic effect of HA15 on cancer
growth in mice, together with the lack of apparent toxicity, this
study provides compelling data to support the future evaluation
of HA15 in clinical trials and strengthens the idea that ER stress
inducers could be useful, alone, or in combination, as a new ther-
apeutic approach in cancer treatment.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Reagents and Antibodies
Trypan blue, DMEM, RPMI, penicillin/streptomycin, trypsin, Hoechst, TUNEL
assay, siRNA against CHOP, and XBP1 primers were purchased from
Life Technologies and fetal calf serum (FCS) from was purchased from
Hyclone. MCDB 153 medium and biotin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Labrafils M1944 Cs was purchased from Gattefosse
´ . Annexin V and DAPI
were purchased from Roche Applied Science. ER Tracker was purchased
from Molecular Probes. Dabrafenib and PLX4032 were purchased from
Euromedex.
Cell Cultures
Normal human melanocytes and fibroblasts were prepared and maintained as
described (Tomic et al., 2011). Different melanoma cell lines were purchased
from the American Tissue Culture Collection. Resistant melanoma cell lines
A375 and SKMel28 were a gift from Professor P. Marchetti and described in
Corazao-Rozas et al. (2013). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 or in DMEM sup-
plemented with 10% FCS and penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/ml/50 mg/ml) at
37�C and 5% CO2. Fresh sterile tissues were obtained from surgical waste
from patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma at the Nice CHU hospital
and treated as reported (Cerezo et al., 2013). See Supplemental Experimental
Procedures for cell preparation. Written informed consent was obtained from
each patient included in this study, and the study was approved by the hospital
ethics committee (Nice Hospital Center and University of Nice Sophia Antipo-
lis, no. 210-2998). For each experiment, cells were starved without serum for
14 hr before drug stimulation.
SiRNA Transfection
Transfection of duplex siRNAs (50 nmol/l) was carried out using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) in OptiMEM (Invitrogen) as described (Botton et al.,
2009).
Trypan Blue Exclusion Assay
For trypan blue staining, 200 ml of cells was aseptically transferred to a 1.5 ml
clear Eppendorf tube and incubated for 3 min at room temperature with an
equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue solution. Viable cells were counted and
the results are expressed as the percentage of the value of control cells. All
the experiments are performed 3 times in triplicate.
Western Blot Assays
Western blot analyses were performed as described (Lehraiki et al., 2014). Pro-
teins were extracted in buffer containing 50 mmol/l Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 15 mmol/l
NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1X protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Briefly,
cell lysates (30 mg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyviny-
lidene fluoride membrane (Millipore), and then exposed to the appropriate
antibodies. Proteins were visualized with the ECL System from Amersham.
The western blot analyses shown are representative of at least three indepen-
dent experiments.
XBP1 mRNA Splicing Assay
Splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA is used as a measure of
IRE1a activation. The following primers were used to amplify both unspliced
and spliced human XBP1 mRNA: XBP1-F, 50-TTA CGA GAG AAA ACT CAT
GGC C-30 and XBP1-R, 50-GGG TCC AAG TTG TCC AGA ATG C-30 to yield
products of 289 and 263 bp, respectively. PCR was conducted using target
cDNA with Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) as follows:
2 min at 98�C, then 35 cycles of 98�C for 20 s, 52�C for 30 s, 72�C for 20 s fol-
lowed by 1 min at 72�C. Fragments representing spliced and unspliced XBP1
(289 bp and 263 bp, respectively) were visualized on 4% agarose gels with
ethidium bromide staining.

 Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described (Cerezo et al.,
2013).
For co-localization experiments, cells were incubated with ER Tracker for
15 min at 37�C. After washing, HA15 and ER staining was observed directly
on live cells with the 403 objective using a Zeiss microscope. Cells were
then fixed and permeabilized as describe above and then exposed to a BiP
antibody overnight at 4�C. Cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothio-
cyanate-coupled anti-rabbit antibody for 1 hr at room temperature.

Gene Expression Profiling and GSEA
See Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
BiP ATPase Enzymatic Activity
Concentration-dependent spectrophotometric assays were carried out using
recombinant human BiP protein (catalog no. ab78432; Abcam) at con-
centrations of 0.063, 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mM in 50 ml of assay buffer
(20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2). The reaction was started
by adding 100 mM ATP and incubating at 37�C for 30 min. Liberated free
phosphate (Pi) was measured by a malachite green-phosphate assay
(catalog no. 10009325; Cayman). The assay method is based on formation
of a complex between malachite green molybdate and Pi (free orthophos-
phate) that absorbs at 620–640 nm. Assays to determine inhibition of
ATPase activity were done with BiP (0.25 mM), with or without HA15
(0–100 mM).
Electron Microscopy
Electron microscopy experiments were performed as described (Tomic et al.,
2011).
Pull-Down Assay
Full-length recombinant BiP protein (20 mg) was incubated with HA15-biotin or
biotin overnight at 4�C. Fifty microliters of streptavidin-agarose was added for
2 hr at 4�C. The HA15/BiP complex was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immuno-
blotted using anti-BiP antibody.
In Vivo Murine Cancer Model
Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with French law and were
approved by a local institutional ethical committee CIEPAL (Comite
´ Institution-
nel d‘E
´ thique Pour l‘Animal de Laboratoire-Azur).
Circulating Levels of Transaminases
Determination of serum transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase/alanine
aminotransferase) was performed using in vitro tests with pyridoxal phosphate
activation on Roche/Hitachi cobas c systems (ASTPM, ALTPM, cobas).
