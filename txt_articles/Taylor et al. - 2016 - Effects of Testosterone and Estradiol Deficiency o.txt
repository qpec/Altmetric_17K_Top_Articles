Context: The hormonal basis of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in hypogonadal men is incompletely
understood.
Objective: To determine the contributions of testosterone and estradiol deficiency to VMS in
hypogonadal men.
Design: Two randomized trials were conducted sequentially between September 2004 and April
2011. Controls were recruited separately.
Setting: A single-site academic medical center.
Participants: Healthy men ages 20–50, with normal serum testosterone levels.
Intervention: Cohort 1 (n � 198, 81% completion) received goserelin acetate every 4 weeks to
suppress gonadal steroids and were randomized to placebo or 1.25, 2.5, 5, or 10 g of testosterone
gel daily for 16 weeks. Cohort 2 (n � 202, 78% completion) received the same regimen as cohort
1 plus anastrozole to block aromatization of testosterone. Controls (n � 37, 89% completion)
received placebos for goserelin acetate and testosterone.
Main Outcome Measures: Incidence of visits with VMS. This was a preplanned secondary analysis.
Results: VMS were reported at 26% of visits in cohort 1, and 35% of visits in cohort 2 (P � .02),
demonstrating an effect of estradiol deficiency. When adjacent estradiol level groups in cohort 1
were compared, the largest difference in VMS incidence was observed between the 5–9.9 and
10–14.9 pg/mL groups (38% vs 16%, P � .001). In cohort 2, the 10-g testosterone group differed
significantly from placebo (16% vs 43%,P � .048) after adjustment for small differences in estradiol
levels, indicating that high testosterone levels may suppress VMS.
Conclusions: Estradiol deficiency is the key mediator of VMS in hypogonadal men. At high levels,
testosterone may have a suppressive effect. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 101: 3479–3486, 2016)
V
asomotor symptoms (VMS), or hot flashes, are a car-
dinal event of the menopause and are reported by
about 75% of postmenopausal women (1). Although less
well appreciated, VMS are common in men with severe
hypogonadism. For example, approximately 70% of men
undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate
cancer report hot flashes (1–3). As in women, VMS can
disrupt many aspects of a man’s life, including sleep, cog-
nitive function, and social life, resulting in a lower sense of
wellbeing (2). Although the hormonal basis of VMS, par-

 ticularly the importance of estrogen withdrawal, has been
investigated extensively in women (4–7), the roles of tes-
tosterone and estradiol in the pathogenesis of VMS in hy-
pogonadal men are not well characterized. To our knowl-
edge, neither the degree to which gonadal steroid levels
must be suppressed nor the specific roles of androgen and
estrogen deficiency in the pathogenesis of VMS in men
have been reported.
To address these questions, we measured serum testos-
terone and estradiol levels and characterized the incidence
of VMS in healthy male volunteers treated with a GnRH
agonist and varying doses of testosterone. Because most
circulating estradiol in men is produced by aromatization
of testosterone (8–11), we repeated this experiment in
another group of men but added an aromatase inhibitor to
suppress estradiol synthesis. Using this paradigm, we ex-
pected serum testosterone levels to be similar in groups
that received concordant testosterone doses, whereas es-
tradiol levels would be discordant because aromatase in-
hibition suppresses estradiol synthesis dramatically. By
comparing the incidence of VMS both within and across
the 2 cohorts, we deduced the relative roles of testosterone
and estradiol, and estimated the minimal levels needed to
prevent VMS.
Materials and Methods
Study subjects
This is a substudy of a physiologic investigation of the con-
sequences of testosterone and estradiol deficiency and their rel-
ative roles in various manifestations of male hypogonadism (12).
We recruited 3 cohorts, designated as cohort 1 (n � 198), cohort
2 (n � 202), and controls (n � 37). The baseline characteristics
of these cohorts have been reported previously (12). Entrance
criteriawereidenticalforall3cohorts.Allmenwere20–50years
old, in good general health and had testosterone levels within our
laboratory’s reference range (270–1070 ng/dL). Additional eli-
gibility criteria have been published previously (12).
Study design and protocol
Subjects in cohorts 1 and 2 received goserelin acetate (Zola-
dex; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP) 3.6 mg sc at weeks 0, 4,
8, and 12 and were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 groups that
received 0 (placebo), 1.25, 2.5, 5, or 10 g of a topical 1% tes-
tosterone gel (AndroGel; AbbVie Pharmaceuticals) daily for 16
weeks. Men in cohort 2 also received anastrozole (Arimidex;
AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP) 1 mg orally each day to sup-
press aromatization of testosterone to estradiol. Controls were
recruited separately and received placebos for both goserelin
acetate and testosterone. All subjects, including the controls,
were blinded to group assignment. Investigators were blinded to
assignments for all groups except the controls.
Subjects were seen every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. At each visit,
fasting blood was collected to measure serum testosterone and
estradiol levels. Daily diaries were reviewed to assess compliance
with the topical gel. VMS occurrence was assessed in 2 ways.
First, subjects were asked to keep a diary indicating the number
of VMS they experienced each day (Supplemental Figure 1). The
description of VMS provided during informed consent is in-
cluded in the Supplemental Methods. Second, as part of a struc-
tured interview at each visit, subjects were asked: “In the last
week, how many hot flashes have you experienced?” Results
from the diaries and structured interview were highly correlated
(r � 0.96). Complete VMS diaries were returned at approxi-
mately 40% of visits and used when available. If diaries were not
returned, data from the structured interview (completed at every
study visit) were used. At each visit, subjects also completed

 surveys assessing fatigue and several domains of health-related
quality of life (Supplemental Results) (13, 14). The study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of Partners Health-
Care. All subjects provided written informed consent. This pro-
tocol was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00114114.
Measurements
Serum total testosterone was measured by solid-phase chemi-
luminescent immunoassay using an automated analyzer (Cen-
taur XP; Siemens). The sensitivity of this assay is 20 ng/dL. Total
testosterone was remeasured by liquid chromatography, tandem
mass spectroscopy at all time points from 5 randomly selected
men in each of the 5 groups in cohort 1 and the controls. The
correlation between the testosterone assays was 0.93, and the
assays gave very similar results (TRIA � 0.98TLC/MS/MS � 21).
Serum estradiol was measured using liquid chromatography,
tandem mass spectroscopy. The sensitivity of this assay is 1.25
pg/mL (15).
Statistical analysis
All subjects who returned for at least 1 visit and who reported
taking at least 80% of their study medication doses are included
in the data analysis. Data were analyzed at the level of the indi-
vidual visit. Thus, each one of a subject’s follow-up visits from
weeks 4 to 16 was independently classified based on whether or
not he reported any VMS in the preceding 7 days. The serum
testosterone and estradiol levels at each visit were used to reflect
the hormonal milieu during the preceding 7 days. The propor-
tions of visits in each testosterone dose group (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, or
10 g daily) at which subjects reported at least 1 VMS event in the
last 7 days were compared using logistic models in which the
mean proportions and their SEs were estimated with generalized
estimating equations that account for the intrasubject correla-
tions of the longitudinal events. Similar analyses were performed
when visits were grouped by serum testosterone levels (�100,
100–199, 200–299, 300–499, 500–699, and �700 ng/dL) or
serum estradiol levels (�5, 5–9.9, 10–14.9, 15–24.9, 25–34.9,
or �35 pg/mL) at each visit. Data are presented as the mean �
SD unless otherwise noted. All P values are 2-sided. P � .05 are
considered significant.
Data interpretation
Relative roles of testosterone and estradiol in VMS
We used 3 approaches to assess our primary goal, to deter-
mine whether deficiency of estradiol, testosterone, or both leads
to the development of VMS. To ascertain the role of estradiol, we
first compared the overall incidence of visits with VMS in men in
whom aromatization of testosterone to estradiol was intact (co-
hort 1) vs the incidence of VMS in men in whom aromatization

cohort 2 (GnRH agonist plus testosterone plus anastrozole, n � 202), and controls (placebo GnRH agonist plus placebo testosterone, n � 37). Four
men in cohort 1 and 1 in cohort 2 were excluded for protocol violations. In cohort 1, 8 men completed only their baseline visit, 2 discontinued the
study at week 4, and 24 men discontinued between weeks 8 and 16. In cohort 2, 24 men completed only their baseline visit, 3 discontinued the
study at week 4, and 17 men discontinued between weeks 8 and 16. Three men in cohort 1 and 1 man in cohort 2 did not have estradiol levels
measured at any visit and were excluded from the analysis of VMS and estradiol levels. Modified and reproduced with permission from Finkelstein

 was suppressed (cohort 2). Administration of identical testos-
terone doses to men treated with a GnRH agonist alone (cohort
1) or men treated with a GnRH agonist plus anastrozole (cohort
2) should produce dose groups with similar testosterone levels
but discordant estradiol levels. Thus, differences between co-
horts 1 and 2 should reflect estradiol deficiency. Next, we com-
pared the incidence of visits with VMS between cohorts 1 and 2
at each testosterone dose. Finally, to determine whether testos-
terone exerts an effect on VMS, we compared the incidence of
visits with VMS in the placebo testosterone group with the in-
cidence of VMS in the 1.25-, 2.5-, 5-, and 10-g testosterone
groups in cohort 2.
Levels of testosterone and estradiol necessary to pre-
vent VMS
We also used 3 approaches to estimate the levels of testos-
terone and estradiol below which VMS reporting in cohort 1
began to increase. First, we clustered visits for men in cohort 1
according to their ambient testosterone or estradiol levels as de-
scribed above, and compared the incidence of visits with VMS in
each testosterone or estradiol level group with the controls.
Next, we compared the incidence of visits with VMS in adjacent
estradiol and testosterone level groups in cohort 1. Finally, we
compared the incidence of visits with VMS in men with testos-
terone or estradiol levels above or below prespecified “break-
points” (5, 10, or 15 pg/mL for estradiol and 100, 200, and 300
ng/dL for testosterone) in cohort 1.
Results
Baseline characteristics and protocol completion
Baseline characteristics were similar among groups and
across cohorts (Table 1). Recruitment and progression
through the protocol is shown in Figure 1. Sixteen men (6
in cohort 1 and 10 in cohort 2) listed VMS as a reason for
discontinuing the protocol. Follow-up data were available
in 13 of these 16 men. None of the controls discontinued
the protocol due to VMS.
Testosterone and estradiol
levels
In cohort 1, mean serum testos-
terone levels from weeks 4 through
16 were 44 � 13, 191 � 78, 337 �
173, 470 � 201, and 788 � 353 ng/
dL, and mean estradiol levels were
3.6 � 1.4, 7.9 � 2.9, 11.9 � 5.7,
18.2 � 10.2, and 33.3 � 15.3 pg/mL
in men receiving goserelin acetate
and 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, or 10 g of testos-
terone gel daily (Figure 2). In cohort
2, mean testosterone levels were
41 � 13, 231 � 171, 367 � 248,
485 � 240, and 924 � 521 ng/dL,
and mean estradiol levels were 1.0 �
0.4, 1.2 � 0.4, 2.0 � 2.3, 2.1 � 1.9,
and 2.8 � 1.8 pg/mL. Mean serum
testosterone and estradiol levels in
the controls from weeks 0 through
16were589�171ng/dLand28.8�
8.6 pg/mL. Within each testosterone
dose group in cohorts 1 and 2, mean
serum testosterone and estradiol lev-
els on therapy were similar in the
men who completed the protocol
and those who discontinued the pro-
tocol prematurely (data not shown).

deficiency. Controls reported VMS at 4% of visits. Al-
though the percentage of visits at which subjects reported
VMS was higher in all testosterone dose groups in cohort
2thanincohort1,onlythedifferencebetweenthe2.5gdaily
groups was statistically significant (14% in cohort 1 vs 38%
in cohort 2, P � .003) (Figure 3). Sixty-four percent of men
in cohort 1 who received placebo testosterone reported ex-
periencing VMS on at least 1 occasion.
Within cohort 2, the percentage of visits with VMS was
significantlygreaterintheplacebotestosteronegroup(43%)
than in the 2.5 g (38%, P � .01 vs placebo) and 10 g (16%,
P � .001 vs placebo) groups, and tended to be higher in the
group that received 5 g of testosterone daily (37%; P � .054
vs placebo). When the differences between testosterone dose
groups within cohort 2 were adjusted for the small differ-
ences in estradiol levels, only the 10-g group remained sig-
nificantly different from placebo (placebo vs 10 g, P � .048;
placebo vs 5 g, P � .70; placebo vs 2.5 g, P � .08; placebo vs
1.25g,P�.44),indicatingthathighlevelsoftestosteroneare

Relationship of VMS to estradiol and testosterone
levels
When visits were grouped by ambient estradiol levels,
the incidence of VMS in cohort 1 was significantly greater
than in controls until estradiol levels rose above 25 pg/mL.
When adjacent estradiol level groups were compared, a
significant difference in the incidence of visits with VMS
was observed between the 5–9.9 and 10–14.9 pg/mL
groups (38% vs 16%, P � .001) (Figure 4A). When visits
in cohort 1 were grouped by ambient testosterone levels,
the incidence of VMS at every level group except for 500–
699 ng/dL differed from the controls (Figure 4B). When
adjacent testosterone level groups were compared, a sig-
nificant difference was observed between the less than 100
and 100–199 ng/dL groups (49% vs 26%, P � .001) and
the 300–499 and 500–699 ng/dL groups (20% vs 6%,
P � .006).
Evaluation of testosterone and estradiol
breakpoints
The incidence of VMS was significantly greater at visits
with testosterone levels below 100 (47% vs 25%), 200
(43% vs 22%), or 300 ng/dL (41% vs 18%) than at visits
with testosterone levels above these values (P � .001 for
all comparisons). Similarly, the incidence of VMS was sig-
nificantly greater at visits with estradiol levels below 5
(40% vs 18%), 10 (40% vs 11%), and 15 pg/mL (37% vs
10%) than at visits with estradiol levels above these values
(P � .001 for all comparisons).
Discussion
In this study, we used hormonal manipulations so that
subgroups of men in cohorts 1 and 2 would have concor-
dant levels of testosterone and discordant estradiol levels
as serum testosterone levels ranged from severely hypogo-
nadal to mildly supraphysiologic. As expected, serum es-
tradiol levels increased progressively as the testosterone
dose increased in cohort 1 but remained low in cohort 2
because those men also received
anastrozole. The incidence of VMS
was greater when anastrozole was
added to the treatment regimen (co-
hort 2) than when aromatization of
testosterone to estradiol was intact
(cohort 1). Notably, the incidence of
VMS was elevated even in men
whose
serum
testosterone
levels
were above the physiologic range if
estradiol levels were below 10 pg/mL
(Figure 3). This finding provides
clear evidence that estrogen defi-
ciency plays a pivotal role in the
pathogenesis of VMS in men. Be-
cause of concerns that administering
estradiol to GnRH agonist-treated
men might cause undesirable femi-
nizing side effects such as gyneco-
mastia, we did not include a group of
men with isolated testosterone defi-

between the 2.5-g testosterone groups. Number of visits with VMS over total visits (cohort 1,
cohort 2) in each testosterone dose group: 67/160, 50/116 for 0 g; 63/160, and 60/140 for

 ciency and normal or high estradiol levels. We did, how-
ever, have men who received a GnRH agonist plus testos-
terone and anastrozole (cohort 2), creating a hormonal
milieu of isolated androgen exposure. After adjustment
for the small increase in estradiol levels observed in those
men as testosterone doses increased, only the 10 g daily
group had a significantly lower incidence of VMS than the
placebo group, suggesting that only high doses of testos-
terone reduce the likelihood that estrogen deficiency will
cause VMS. When data from cohort 1 were analyzed by
ambient hormone levels, VMS incidence approached the
controls’ rate at testosterone levels above 500 ng/dL.
Thus, our data demonstrate that estradiol deficiency is the
primary stimulus for VMS in men and that high levels of
testosterone reduce VMS.
It is widely believed that declining estradiol levels play
an important role in the pathogenesis of VMS in peri-
menopausal and postmenopausal women (4–7, 16, 17)
and can even lead to VMS in premenopausal women dur-
ing the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (18). Similar
to men, 69% of healthy premenopausal women treated
with a GnRH agonist report VMS (19). It has been pro-
posed that declining estrogen levels narrow the thermo-
neutral zone between core body temperatures that trigger
sweatingandshivering(20,21).Althoughthebrainregion
responsible for VMS remains uncertain, recent studies
suggest that signaling via the neurokinin 3 receptor and
arcuate kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin neurons
projecting to preoptic thermoregulatory areas may
explain the link between estrogen deficiency and VMS
(22, 23).
Few studies have examined the role of gonadal steroids
in the pathogenesis of VMS in men. One study reported
that VMS occur less frequently in men with advanced
prostate cancer treated with a selective estrogen receptor
modulator with intrinsic estrogen receptor-� agonist ac-
tivity than in men treated with a long-acting GnRH ago-
nist (24), suggesting that estrogen reduces the risk of de-
veloping VMS in men. In surgically postmenopausal
women, adding low-dose testosterone or methyltestoster-
one to a regimen of estrogen replacement was no more
effective in preventing VMS than was treatment with es-
trogen alone (25, 26). In our study, testosterone was un-
able to suppress the development of VMS unless given in
doses that produced supraphysiologic levels. Thus, it ap-
pears that physiologic levels of androgens do not play a
major role in regulation of VMS in men or women.
Recent evidence has shown that estrogen deficiency is
responsible for several of the cardinal manifestations of
male hypogonadism, including high-turnover bone loss
(27–30), accumulation of body fat (12), and surprisingly,
loss of libido and erectile function (12). The current study
demonstrates that VMS represent another key manifesta-
tion of male hypogonadism that is largely related to es-
trogen deficiency rather than to androgen deficiency.
Unexpectedly, the incidence of VMS was higher in men
receiving a GnRH agonist and testosterone add-back de-
spitebeinggivenindosessufficienttoproducemeanserum
testosterone or estradiol levels similar to those of the con-
trols. This finding, along with some other anomalies in the
data, probably reflects the fact that gonadal steroid levels
fluctuate far more in men given a GnRH agonist and tes-
tosterone add-back than in men achieving the same levels
via normal endogenous secretion (31). We assessed VMS
over a 7-day period and only measured gonadal steroids
on the last day of that interval. Thus, levels may have been
sufficiently low to cause VMS at one point during that

according to their mean serum estradiol (upper panel) and
testosterone (lower panel) levels from weeks 4 to 16. The percentage
of visits with incident VMS in the controls is also shown. The incidence
of VMS decreased significantly as estradiol levels rose from 5–9.9 to
10–14.9 pg/mL. For testosterone, the incidence of VMS decreased
significantly as serum levels rose from less than 100 to 100–199 ng/dL
and again from 300–499 to 500–699 ng/dL. Groups with an asterisk
differed significantly from the controls. For each estradiol level group,
number of visits with VMS over total visits: 82/175 for les than 5 pg/

 7-day period but could have been normal on the day of
their visit. Although the basis for this increased variability
is not known, it is likely related to variability in absorption
or compliance with the testosterone gel and/or the absence
of the normal feedback regulation of the hypothalamic-
pituitary-testicular axis.
Our study has other limitations. Prospective diaries
were used to estimate VMS occurrence at only 40% of
visits. However, diary and recall data were highly corre-
lated. Although diaries are better than recall, they are less
sensitive than electronic event marking and sternal skin
conductance for detecting VMS (32). Thus, we probably
underestimated the true incidence of VMS, although self-
report should accurately estimate the incidence of VMS
that are noticed by subjects. In addition to probable un-
derreporting of mild VMS, false positive reporting also
likely occurred, as evidenced by the reporting of VMS at
4.3% of visits (in 11% of men) in the controls. We re-
peated our analyses requiring that subjects report more
than 1 or more than 4 hot flashes to be considered as
experiencingVMS,buttheoveralltrendsforbothanalyses
did not change (data not shown). Finally, to minimize the
risk of gynecomastia, we did not include a group of men
who received only a GnRH agonist and estradiol. Thus, in
both cohorts 1 and 2, low testosterone levels were almost
always accompanied by low estradiol levels, so that
changes observed in men with low testosterone levels
could be due to androgen deficiency alone, estrogen defi-
ciency alone, or both.
In summary, we created a series of dose-response rela-
tionships to determine the relative roles of testosterone
and estradiol in the pathogenesis of VMS in men. We
found that estradiol is the primary hormonal regulator of
male VMS. These data suggest that aromatizable andro-
gens may have advantages over nonaromatizable andro-
gens in the management of symptomatic male hypogo-
nadism, and add to the growing body of evidence that
estrogen deficiency should be considered as a discrete hor-
mone deficiency syndrome in men.
