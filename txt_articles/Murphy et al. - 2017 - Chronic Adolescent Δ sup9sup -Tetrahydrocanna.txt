Abstract
Introduction: The high prevalence of adolescent cannabis use, the association between this use and later psy-
chiatric disease, and increased access to high-potency cannabis highlight the need for a better understanding of
the long-term effects of adolescent cannabis use on cognitive and behavioral outcomes. Furthermore, increasing
D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in high-potency cannabis is accompanied by a decrease in cannabidiol (CBD),
thus an understanding of the interactions between CBD and THC in the neurodevelopmental effects of THC
is also important. The current study examined the immediate and long-term behavioral consequences of
THC, CBD, and their combination in a mouse model of adolescent cannabis use.
Materials and Methods: Male CD1 mice received daily injections of THC (3 mg/kg), CBD (3 mg/kg), CBD + THC
(3 mg/kg each), vehicle, or remained undisturbed in their home cage (no handling/injections), either during ad-
olescence (postnatal day [PND] 28–48) or during early adulthood (PND 69–89). Animals were then evaluated with
a battery of behavioral tests 1 day after drug treatment, and again after 42 drug-free days. The tests included the
following: open field (day 1), novel object recognition (NOR; day 2), marble burying (day 3), elevated plus maze
(EPM; day 4), and Nestlet shredding (day 5).
Results: Chronic administration of THC during adolescence led to immediate and long-term impairments in ob-
ject recognition/working memory, as measured by the NOR task. In contrast, adult administration of THC caused
immediate, but not long term, impairment of object/working memory. Adolescent chronic exposure to THC in-
creased repetitive and compulsive-like behaviors, as measured by the Nestlet shredding task. Chronic adminis-
tration of THC, either during adolescence or during adulthood, led to a delayed increase in anxiety as measured
by the EPM. All THC-induced behavioral abnormalities were prevented by the coadministration of CBD + THC,
whereas CBD alone did not influence behavioral outcomes.
Conclusion: These data suggest that chronic exposure to THC during adolescence leads to some of the behav-
ioral abnormalities common in schizophrenia. Interestingly, CBD appeared to antagonize all THC-induced behav-
ioral abnormalities. These findings support the hypothesis that adolescent THC use can impart long-term
behavioral deficits; however, cotreatment with CBD prevents these deficits.

 Introduction
Cannabis contains more than 60 cannabinoids.1–3 Of
these, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the major psy-
choactive and cannabidiol (CBD) is the main nonpsy-
choactive component of cannabis. Through genetic
interactions, breeding for high-THC content (to create
high-potency cannabis) results in very low-CBD levels.
The market demand for high-potency cannabis has seen
the average THC content of U.S. cannabis increasing
from *4% to 12% in the past 20 years. This has been
accompanied by a corresponding decrease in CBD con-
tent, increasing the average THC/CBD ratio *20-fold
over the same period.4
Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug among
adolescents in the United States.5 In 2016, 12.8% of 8th
graders have used cannabis in their lifetime, and by
12th grade 44.5% have tried cannabis.5 Furthermore,
daily use increases from 0.7% among 8th graders to
6% among 12th graders.5 The high prevalence of fre-
quent adolescent cannabis use, and the increased pres-
ence of high-THC/low-CBD cannabis, emphasizes a
need for research examining the long-lasting effects
of chronic adolescent exposure to major cannabis con-
stituents on neurobehavioral outcomes.
During human adolescence (age *10–25), neuro-
anatomical and functional changes lead to increased
neural and cognitive efficiency.6–8 As the prefrontal
cortex (PFC) matures during adolescence, it under-
goes significant synaptic remodeling and changes
in myelination.9–12 The PFC is responsible for higher
order cognitive function such as executive function,13–15
and disruption of maturation PFC can be expected to
have long-lasting adverse consequences.
Because of the prominent role of endocannabinoids in
neurodevelopment,16 cannabis exposure during adoles-
cence might perturb PFC neurodevelopment and cause
long-term cognitive, emotional, and behavioral impair-
ments. Supporting this hypothesis, many studies indicate a
positive correlation between adolescent cannabis use and
aspects of schizophrenia (age of first psychotic episode, se-
verity).17–22 Factors such as onset of use, frequency of use,
and the THC/CBD ratio in cannabis consumed have been
shown to modulate this risk.17,23,24 For instance, after con-
trolling for confounding variables (e.g., IQ, psychiatric ill-
ness in family members), a large population-based study
found a dose-dependent relationship of adolescent canna-
bis use and the development of schizophrenia.19 In addi-
tion, the risk of developing a psychotic disorder was
shown to increase threefold among users of high-potency
cannabis compared with subjects who never used canna-
bis.25 In this study, daily use of high-potency cannabis
conferred an even higher (>fivefold) risk for developing
schizophrenia.25
A causal relationship between adolescent cannabis
use and an increased risk for schizophrenia is unlikely
to be proven given ethical constraints. Thus, research
utilizing animal models, rigorously controlled experi-
mental design, and examination of specific cannabis
components can identify potential mechanisms linking
frequent adolescent cannabis use and an increased risk
for schizophrenia. Furthermore, examining the vari-
ables involved in producing schizophrenia-associated
phenotypes—such as impairment of working and ob-
ject recognition memory, anxiety, and repetitive and
compulsive behaviors—might provide valuable insight
into schizophrenia’s etiology. Working26–29 and object
recognition memory30–32 deficits are frequent in
schizophrenia. Furthermore, repetitive and compulsive
behaviors33,34 as well as anxiety35,36 are common in
schizophrenia.
This study examined the immediate and long-term
effects of chronic cannabinoid exposure on object rec-
ognition/working memory, repetitive and compulsive
behaviors, and anxiety in adolescent and adult mice.
We found that adolescent THC impaired selected be-
havioral domains and that this impairment was pre-
vented by concurrent CBD treatment.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
Male CD1 mice (n = 221) were bred and housed three
to four per cage under a standard reversed light cycle
housing facility (light–dark cycle of 12 h: lights on at
7 p.m.). Food and water were available ad libitum.
All experimental procedures were approved by Indiana
University’s Bloomington Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee.
Drugs
Injection solutions were made by dissolving THC, CBD,
or CBD+THC in 100% ethanol to a concentration of
6mg/mL for each drug. In a second tube, Kolliphor� EL
(synonym: Cremophor� EL; Sigma-Aldrich) was mixed
with sterile 0.9% saline. The dissolved cannabinoid was
then mixed with the Cremophor/NaCl solution to a
final ratio of 1:1:18 (cannabinoid/ethanol:Cremophor:
saline). The final concentration of each component in
the injection solutions was 0.3 mg/mL cannabinoid, 5%
ethanol, 5% Cremophor, and 0.81% NaCl. Mice were
injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 3 mg/kg of the

 indicated drug (in a volume of 10 mL/kg). Controls re-
ceived a vehicle consisting of 5% ethanol, 5% Cremo-
phor, and 0.81% NaCl (also at a volume of 10 mL/kg).
Injection and behavioral testing schedule
Mice were randomly assigned to one of five groups: no
treatment control (remained in home cages during 3
weeks of treatment, subjected only to routine cage
changes); vehicle control; THC (3 mg/kg); CBD
(3 mg/kg); or CBD + THC (3 mg/kg each). Animals
underwent daily i.p. injections either during adoles-
cence (postnatal day [PND] 28–48) or during adult-
hood (PND 69–89; Fig. 1). Animals were behaviorally
tested starting 24 h after the last injection, and again 6
weeks later. The behavioral battery included open
field (day 1), novel object recognition (NOR; day 2),
marble burying (day 3), elevated plus maze (EPM; day
4), and Nestlet shredding (day 5).
Procedures
Animals were habituated to the testing room for 30 min
before testing. Testing was conducted within a 100 lux
illuminated room, during the dark phase of the light–
dark cycle. Conditions were counterbalanced across
the testing sessions. All apparatuses were wiped down
with a diluted 2% chlorhexidine solution (AgriLabs,
St. Joseph, MO) between trials. An observer blind to
group allocations manually scored video-recorded tri-
als, except for the open field assay (OFA), which uti-
lized an automated scoring system (The Fusion
software program; Omnitech Electronics, Inc.; Colum-
bus, OH).

 Novel object recognition
The NOR task evaluates working and object recognition
memory and takes advantage of a mouse’s inherent ten-
dency to explore novel more than familiar objects.37 Dur-
ing the NOR’s familiarization phase, mice were exposed
to two equivalent objects within a Plexiglass chamber
(42L·42W·32H cm; AccuScan Instruments, Colum-
bus, OH) for 5min. (Untreated mice spent an equal
amount of time exploring the two objects used in the
NOR study; Supplementary Fig. S1.) The same pairs of
objects were used for all testing. After a 105-min interses-
sion interval, mice were returned to the chamber; how-
ever, one of the previously shown ‘‘familiar’’ objects was
removed and replaced with a novel object. Familiar and
novel object positions were counterbalanced across testing
sessions. Testing lasted 3min and was recorded using a
webcam (Logitech Pro 9000 PC Internet Camera Web-
cam, 2.0-Megapixel Video Resolution and Carl Zeiss
Lens Optics; Romanel-sur-Morges, Switzerland).
Exploration was defined by the mouse’s nose pointed
toward and within a 2-cm radius of an object. To assess
performance in this task, a discrimination index (DI) was
calculated. The DI quantified the difference between time
spent exploring the novel and familiar object during test-
ing as a fraction of total exploratory time, DI= (TN�TF)/
(TN + TF), where novel object exploration time is TN and
familiar object exploration time is TF. The DI can range
between +1 and�1, where a positive score indicates more
time exploring the novel object, a negative score indicates
more time exploring the familiar object, and zero indi-
cates null preference.37 Important to the interpretation
of these studies, chronic THC administration to mice
leads to impaired object recognition, which takes several
days to resolve.38

sive and repetitive-like behavior in mice, which takes

 advantage of a mouse’s inherent tendency to shred ma-
terial for nest building.39 In this task, mice were individ-
ually placed in a clean mouse cage with *2 cm (height)
of woodchip bedding material and one 2· 2 in. packed
cotton Nestlet (Ancare Corp; Bellmore, NY) laid on
top of the bedding. Testing lasted 75 min. The remaining
Nestlet was collected, dried overnight, and weighed, and
the percentage of the Nestlet shredded was calculated.
Marble burying
The marble burying task is a measure of repetitive-like
behavior in rodents, and takes advantage of a mouse’s
inherent tendency to bury objects,39,40 although marble
burying can also be affected by changes in aversion to
novelty, novelty-induced anxiety, excessive locomo-
tion, etc. Mice were individually placed into a clean
mouse cage containing 5 cm (height) of corncob bed-
ding, with 20 evenly placed blue marbles (5 · 4) laid
on top. Testing was for 8 min. Marbles that were at
least three-fourth covered by bedding were considered
to be buried.
Elevated plus maze
The EPM measures anxiety-like behavior in rodents.41
Mice were individually placed in the central-open area
within the EPM. Testing was for 5min. Scoring was
based on (1) time spent in the open versus closed arms
and (2) entries into the open versus closed arms. As an
index of locomotor activity, the total number of entries
into all four EPM arms was also counted. Behavior was
recorded using the same webcam as above.
Open field
The OFA was used to assess locomotion and thigmotaxis,
the latter as an alternative measure of anxiety.42 Mice were
placed into a Plexiglass chamber (42L·42W·32H cm)
and allowed to acclimate to the chamber for *3min.
Activity was then measured for three, consecutive 10-
min bins. The Fusion software program collected data
from sensors located along the bottom periphery of the
chamber. Fusion distinguishes the interior (21·21cm
within the center of the chamber) versus peripheral
zones (10.5cm from edge to center) of the chamber,

 which is used for scoring. Two variables were analyzed in
this study: duration (whole body) and distance traveled
(whole body) within each zone.
Determination of THC plasma levels
Lipid extractions of plasma obtained by exsanguina-
tion 24 h after the last cannabinoid injection were per-
formed in a separate group of adolescent male CD1
mice receiving 21 days of THC or THC + CBD, as pre-
viously described.43 Deuterium-labeled anandamide
(d8AEA; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) was
used as an internal standard to determine extraction
efficiency. Samples were analyzed using an Applied
Biosystems API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spec-
trometer with electrospray ionization (Foster City,
CA). THC levels were determined by running each
sample using a multiple reactions monitoring method
to detect the 315.2 parent ion mass and the 123.2 frag-
ment. Analysis of the HPLC/MS/MS data was per-
formed using Analyst software (Applied Biosystems)
as previously described.43
Statistical analysis
Analyses were conducted using Microsoft Excel 2016
(Redmond, WA) and GraphPad Prism 7 (La Jolla,
CA), with the level of significance set at 0.05. Signifi-
cance was assessed by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA), or by Student’s t-test if two samples were
compared. If a significant difference in ANOVA was
detected, Tukey’s post hoc analyses were conducted.
Results
Adolescent THC leads to long-term
impairment in NOR
Three weeks of THC treatment significantly decreased
the DI in both adolescent and adult mice relative to all
other treatment groups (Fig. 2). However, although the
DI remained decreased in adolescent-treated mice 6

 weeks after the final THC dose, the DI had recovered to
control levels in the adult-treated mice (Fig. 2). Thus, 3
weeks of THC treatment similarly impaired NOR in ad-
olescent and adult mice, but although the impairment
was transient in the adult-treated mice, it was persistent
in mice treated during adolescence. If a treatment mark-
edly decreased exploratory time, then the DI may also be
decreased. However, Figure 3 shows no major differences
in total exploration times among treatment groups, or
testing times.
CBD has been observed to attenuate various unde-
sirable effects of THC,44–47 and the risk of developing
schizophrenia among heavy cannabis users appears
to increase as CBD content decreases.23–25,48 There-
fore, we examined whether concurrently administered
CBD would prevent either the immediate or long-
term consequences of THC administration on NOR.
Interestingly, chronic administration of CBD alone
did not affect NOR performance (Fig. 2), whereas co-
administration of CBD + THC completely abolished
the deleterious consequences of THC on DI among
adolescent- and adult-treated mice (Fig. 2).
Nestlet shredding
Figure 4 shows that adolescent THC treatment increases
Nestlet shredding at both time periods investigated. In
contrast, adult THC treatment did not increase Nestlet
shredding when compared with vehicle controls. As
with impaired NOR, concurrent treatment with CBD
prevented both the immediate and long-lasting THC-
induced increases in Nestlet shredding (Fig. 4).
Marble burying
Figure 5 shows marble burying was enhanced immedi-
ately after 3 weeks of THC treatment of adolescent
mice. Although not reaching our threshold for statis-
tical significance, there was a strong trend for a dif-
ference in the adolescent THC-treated mice versus
vehicle ( p = 0.06). Six weeks later, there were no appar-
ent differences between any of the groups receiving

 injections. The pattern was quite different in the adult-
treated mice. Chronic CBD treatment resulted in fewer
marbles buried relative to the two control groups and
the combined CBD + THC group when tested immedi-
ately after the end of injections (Fig. 5). However, when
adults were tested 6 weeks later, no significant differ-
ences were apparent between the various treatment
groups.
Elevated plus maze
Both adolescent- and adult-treated mice exhibited de-
creased EPM open arm entries when tested 6 weeks
after THC treatment, suggesting the late emergence of
anxiety (Fig. 6). This was accompanied by a decrease
in open arm time (Fig. 7). The THC-induced decrease
in open arm entries and duration was prevented by
cotreatment with CBD (Figs. 6 and 7). Adult THC-
treated mice also showed a decrease in open arm entries
immediately after chronic treatment. There were no
consistent differences in total arm entries between the
various treatment groups (data not shown), suggesting
that the various treatments did not have major effects
on locomotor activity in the EPM.
Open field
There were no significant differences in total distance
traveled or thigmotaxis within the OFA arena between
any of the treatment groups (data not shown).
Plasma THC levels
One possible mechanism by which CBD could atten-
uate THC effect is if CBD increased THC metabolism
and lowered THC plasma levels. This seems unlikely
as most studies find that concurrent CBD + THC
does not increase THC metabolism,49 nonetheless, to
test this possibility, THC plasma levels were measured
after 3 weeks of THC or THC + CBD. As shown in
Figure 8, concurrent CBD administration modestly,
but significantly, increased plasma THC levels ( p =
0.027). Thus the attenuation of THC’s effects across

 multiple behavioral tests is not due to increased THC
metabolism and is likely due to a pharmacodynamic
interaction.
Discussion
This study found that THC administration to adoles-
cent male mice for 3 weeks led to long-lasting deficits in
NOR performance and repetitive behaviors, whereas
a similar treatment of adults results in only transient
abnormalities. Furthermore, chronic THC adminis-
tration to both adolescent and adult mice induced
anxiety behaviors after a delay. Very interestingly, co-
administration of CBD prevented all of the THC-
induced impairments observed in this study, whereas
chronic CBD alone was inactive in the assays used
here.

 WIN55,212-2) administration during adolescence,
but not during adulthood, causes object recognition
impairment after a drug-free delay.50–52 Similarly to our
findings with mice and THC, chronic WIN55,212-2 ad-
ministration during adolescence leads to immediate ob-
ject recognition deficits in rats.53 Therefore, this study
provides additional support that THC exposure during
adolescence can lead to enduring cognitive impairment
that is absent if THC is given during adulthood.
THC-induced behavioral impairment
Although this study is the first to specifically examine
the effects of chronic cannabinoid administration on
Nestlet shredding in mice, other studies have found
both acute54 and chronic55 THC disrupted nest build-
ing. Although shredding material is the first step in nest
building, increases in shredding behavior detected by the
Nestlet shredding task are considered a measure of repet-
itive and compulsive-like behavior56 and as a model of
obsessive-compulsive disorder.39 This study is the first
to find that chronic adolescent THC administration
leads to a long-lasting increase in this repetitive behavior.
Our findings also suggest that THC administration
during adolescence transiently increases repetitive behav-
iors, as assessed by the marble-burying task. This differ-
ence was clear when THC mice were compared with
adolescent mice treated with CBD or CBD+THC. In ad-
dition, although just missing our significance threshold,
chronic adolescent THC treatment likely leads to an
immediate increase in marble burying compared with
vehicle. No biologically significant differences in marble
burying were found among adolescent-treated mice tested
6 weeks after the last injection. This is the first study to
examine the effects of chronic THC on marble burying.
Several earlier studies have found that a single dose of
synthetic cannabinoid, CBD, and/or acutely increasing
endocannabinoid levels, suppressed marble burying.57–59
The decrease in CBD-treated adult mice (Fig. 5C) is con-
sistent with these earlier findings.
THC-induced anxiety
This study is the first to examine the persistent effects of
chronic cannabinoid administration on EPM behaviors in
adolescent or adult mice. We found that chronic THC ad-
ministration to either adult or adolescent mice produced a
delayed anxiogenic effect, as measured through EPM. An
earlier study60 using adult mice that examined the effects
of THC or CBD on anxiety behaviors found that a
chronic dose of THC (10mg/kg), higher than that used
in this study, increased anxiety when mice were tested im-
mediately after dosing (vs. 4 days later as in this study). A
previous study examining the effects of chronic, incre-
menting (2.5mg/kg PND 35–37; 5mg/kg PND 38–41;
10mg/kg PND 42–45) THC administration in adolescent
rats of both sexes during the early light cycle found no dif-
ferences in anxiety-like behavior in the EPM, when mea-
sured after a drug-free delay (PND 75).61 The difference
between the cited studies and this study may be due to
species, escalating dose, or delay in testing, etc.
In contrast to the EPM results, no evidence of anxiety
was apparent in any of the open field measures, for any
treatment, age, or post-test interval. Thus, these results
are similar to the previously cited study in rats.61 Owing
to the inclusion of a *3 min acclimation period, it was
not possible to determine whether the various treat-
ments affected acclimation to a novel environment.
CBD protects against THC-induced deficits
Perhaps the most significant finding of our study
is that coadministration of CBD + THC protected
against all of the cognitive and behavioral impair-
ments induced by THC. Interestingly, this was ob-
served even though coadministration of CBD with
THC actually increased plasma THC levels (Fig. 8).
The mechanism of this protection is unclear, but
does not appear to be pharmacokinetic. Numerous
targets have been proposed for CBD.62,63 A particu-
larly interesting potential mechanism that could ex-
plain the current results is CBD’s negative allosteric
modulation of CB1 cannabinoid receptors.64 The find-
ing that coadministration of CBD + THC blocks the
deleterious effects of THC may help explain the higher
psychosis/schizophrenia risk among users of high-
potency THC (and low CBD) cannabis.23,25,48,65 We
chose to administer equal amounts of CBD and THC
for these experiments, as this approximates the ratio
of the acid forms of THC and CBD present in Cannabis
sativa strains expressing both CBD and THC synthe-
ses.66 However, it will be quite interesting to determine
the minimal amount of CBD that is protective.
Conclusions
Chronic THC during adolescence in male mice pro-
duced a selective spectrum of persistent behavioral
consequences. Based on the rat literature, it is likely
that treatment of female mice will also lead to persis-
tent behavioral abnormalities.67–70 Other than late-
emerging anxiety, these abnormalities were absent in
similarly treated adult male mice. These findings rein-

 developmental period, and that sustained exposure to
THC during this time may have long-lasting and detri-
mental consequences on cognition and behavior. The
finding that coadministration of equal amounts of CBD
with THC prevented the emergence of all behavioral def-
icits supports the epidemiological finding that higher
CBD content in cannabis reduces risk for psychotic
disorders.48 Furthermore, encouraging the cultivation
and consumption of ‘‘balanced’’ CBD cannabis (i.e.,
roughly equal proportions of CBD and THC), over
lower CBD cannabis, may be a reasonable strategy
for harm reduction.71
