Abstract
Background—Indoor tanning is associated with an increased risk of melanoma. The US Food 
and Drug Administration proposed prohibiting indoor tanning among minors younger than 18 
years.
Objective—We sought to estimate the health and economic benefits of reducing indoor tanning 
in the United States.
Methods—We used a Markov model to estimate the expected number of melanoma cases and 
deaths averted, life-years saved, and melanoma treatment costs saved by reducing indoor tanning. 
We examined 5 scenarios: restricting indoor tanning among minors younger than 18 years, and 
reducing the prevalence by 20%, 50%, 80%, and 100%.
Results—Restricting indoor tanning among minors younger than 18 years was estimated to 
prevent 61,839 melanoma cases, prevent 6735 melanoma deaths, and save $342.9 million in 
treatment costs over the lifetime of the 61.2 million youth age 14 years or younger in the United 
States. The estimated health and economic benefits increased as indoor tanning was further 
reduced.
Limitations—Limitations include the reliance on available data and not examining compliance to 
indoor tanning laws.
Conclusions—Reducing indoor tanning has the potential to reduce melanoma incidence, 
mortality, and treatment costs. These findings help quantify and underscore the importance of 
continued efforts to reduce indoor tanning and prevent melanoma.

 Indoor tanning is partially responsible for the increase in melanoma incidence rates, 
especially among young women.1 The World Health Organization and the US Department of 
Health and Human Services has classified the ultraviolet radiation from indoor tanning 
devices as carcinogenic to human beings.2,3 A recent meta-analysis estimated that more than 
6000 melanomas are attributable to indoor tanning each year in the United States.1 The risk 
of melanoma is higher among frequent tanners and those initiating indoor tanning at a 
younger age.4,5
Despite its risks, indoor tanning remains common in the United States.6,7 An estimated 11.3 
million Americans engaged in indoor tanning in 2013, 1.6 million of whom are younger than 
18 years. Among high school students, 5% of boys and 20% of girls engaged in indoor 
tanning in 2013.6,7 Among this population, frequent use is common, with over half of indoor 
tanners doing so more than 10 times per year.6 The US Surgeon General has highlighted the 
importance of reducing the harms from indoor tanning.8 In addition, the US Food and Drug 
Administration has announced important proposed steps to protect public health by 
prohibiting the use of indoor tanning among minors, younger than 18 years.9
An earlier study conducted in Australia examining the impact of indoor tanning laws, 
particularly age restrictions, found that such laws could prevent a substantial number of 
melanoma cases and result in significant reductions in melanoma treatment costs.10 A 
similar study has not been conducted in the United States. The purpose of this study is to 
estimate the health benefits of reducing indoor tanning and the associated melanoma 
treatment cost-savings in the United States. Specifically, this study examines the impact of 
reducing indoor tanning under various scenarios on: (1) the expected number of melanoma 
cases averted, (2) the expected number of melanoma deaths averted, (3) the expected life-
years (LYs) saved, and (4) the expected treatment costs saved.
METHODS
Health benefits and melanoma treatment cost-savings were estimated using a Markov model. 
The model follows the current cohort of 61.2 million individuals aged 14 years or younger in 
the United States11 through their lifetime (until death from melanoma or from other causes) 
in 1-year cycles. At the end of each 1-year cycle, individuals could be in 1 of the following 
mutually exclusive health states: (1) never indoor tanned and no melanoma, (2) ever indoor 
tanned and no melanoma, (3) given a diagnosis of melanoma, (4) death from melanoma, and 
(5) death from other causes (Fig 1). During each 1-year cycle individuals face probabilities 
of outcomes given their current state and being 1 year older. For each health state or 
transition an outcome is assigned (eg, a diagnosis of melanoma and associated treatment 
costs). The aggregation of these outcomes over the life of the model is expected to vary 
between individuals based on the use of indoor tanning and its increased melanoma risk. The 
differences between these groups are the primary outputs of the model.
Model parameters and sources
Models inputs were obtained from existing data sources and the published literature. We 
estimated the current probability of ever indoor tanning by age using annual prevalence data 
among individuals age 15 through 18 years from the 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey,12

 and the prevalence of ever indoor tanning in the United States from a recent meta-analysis.1 
We fit an exponential equation using these values (Table I), and imputed the probability of 
ever indoor tanning among individuals age 19 through 76 years. We used a constant 
probability of ever indoor tanning after age 77 years, as suggested by the 2010 and 2013 
National Health Interview Surveys.13
We obtained the age-specific invasive melanoma incidence rates from the 2007 to 2011 US 
Cancer Statistics data set.14 Only invasive melanoma was considered, given that in situ cases 
are not generally associated with increased mortality and are likely to be underreported in 
central cancer registries.15 Individuals initiating indoor tanning before age 35 years had a 
59% higher risk of developing melanoma and individuals initiating use after age 35 years 
had a 20% higher risk, based on results from a systematic review and meta-analysis.4,5
We calculate the age-specific probabilities of death from melanoma from the reduced 
probabilities of surviving based on melanoma relative survival. Given the stabilization of 
relative survival 10 years after a melanoma diagnosis,16 a melanoma diagnosis only 
increased an individual’s mortality for the first 10 years after diagnosis. The age-specific 
probabilities of death from other causes were derived by subtracting melanoma mortality 
from all-cause mortality using 2011 US life tables.17,18
Melanoma treatment costs were obtained from the published literature.19 Treatment costs 
were stratified by age at diagnosis (<65 and ≥65 years) and phase of care. The phase of care 
included the initial phase (the first 12 months after diagnosis), continuing phase (all years in 
between the initial phase and the last year of life), and the last year of life (the final 12 
months of life). The costs for the last year of life were stratified by cause of death (ie, 
melanoma or death from other causes).19 We used the same costs for each year in the 
continuing phase. Among individuals surviving melanoma for more than 5 years, we 
estimated melanoma treatment costs in the initial year, the following 4 years, and the last 
year of life. All costs were adjusted to 2014 US dollars using the medical care component of 
the Consumer Price Index.20 All future costs were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. The 
study takes the US health care payer’s perspective. The model was developed in TreeAge 
Pro 2014 Suite, Version 2.2 (TreeAge Software Inc, Williamstown, MA).
Scenarios
We considered 5 different scenarios: an age restriction on indoor tanning among minors 
younger than 18 years and indoor tanning prevalence reductions of 20%, 50%, 80%, and 
100%. Under the age restriction scenario, the probability of ever indoor tanning was 0 for 
individuals younger than 18 years, 8.8% for those age 18 years (the same as the current 
probability of ever indoor tanning at age 15 years before an age restriction), and increased at 
the same rate as before the age restriction for individuals age 19 years and older. For the 
other 4 scenarios, the probabilities of ever indoor tanning were reduced by 20%, 50%, 80%, 
and 100% based on the current probability of ever indoor tanning.
Outcomes
The main outcome measures of this study for each scenario are as follows: (1) the expected 
number of melanoma cases averted, (2) the expected number of melanoma deaths averted, 
Guy et al.

 (3) the expected LYs saved, and (4) the expected medical costs saved during the lifetime of 
the current cohort of 61.2 million individuals aged 14 years or younger in the United States. 
During each cycle 1 transition can occur, a transition at the beginning of a cycle would result 
in overestimation of LYs, whereas transition at the end would result in underestimation. To 
improve accuracy, we used a half-cycle correction to calculate LYs, in which the transition is 
determined to be in the middle of the cycle.21
Sensitivity analysis
One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of 
the model outcomes and to address the uncertainty or variability of model parameter 
estimates. Parameter values and their statistical distributions used in sensitivity analyses are 
provided in Table I. In 1-way sensitivity analyses, we examined the individual effect of each 
selected parameter on the model’s outcome. For probabilistic sensitivity analyses, we varied 
parameter values simultaneously according to their statistical distributions. We used beta 
distributions for transition probabilities, log-normal distributions for relative risks, gamma 
distributions for costs, and the uniform distribution for the discount factor. We performed 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses using 10,000 replications, and generated 95% uncertainty 
intervals formed by the 2.5 and 97.5 percentile values, for each model outcome.
Model validation
The model was validated by comparing the estimated LYs and the expected lifetime risk of 
melanoma for the US population with the 2011 US life tables18 and the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results program.16
RESULTS
Base-case results
Compared with no age restriction, prohibiting the use of indoor tanning among minors 
younger than 18 years was estimated to avert 61,839 melanoma cases (4.9% reduction) and 
6735 melanoma deaths (4.7% reduction) over the lifetime of the 61.2 million youth age 14 
years or younger in the United States (Table II). This would result in an overall gain of 
142,659 LYs and more than $342 million in melanoma treatment cost-savings. The 
estimated health benefits and melanoma treatment cost-savings increased as the prevalence 
of indoor tanning was reduced. For example, when varying the reduction from 20% to 
100%, the estimated number of melanoma cases averted increased from 40,410 to 202,662 
(3.2% and 16.2% reductions, respectively), and the estimated number of melanoma deaths 
averted increased from 4286 to 23,266 (3.0% and 16.1% reductions, respectively). 
Meanwhile, the expected LYs saved increased from 91,229 to 458,592, and the expected 
melanoma treatment cost-savings increased from $219 million to $1.1 billion over the 
lifetime of the 61.2 million youth age 14 years or younger in the United States.
Sensitivity analysis
One-way sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were most sensitive to the relative risk 
of melanoma and the prevalence of indoor tanning. The results from probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses showed that variability in model parameters led to differences in magnitude of the

 estimated health benefits and treatment cost-savings. For example, with the scenario of 
under-18-years age restriction, the estimated number of melanoma cases averted ranged 
from 37,480 to 89,472; the estimated number of melanoma deaths averted ranged from 4299 
to 10,235; the expected LYs saved ranged from 85,432 to 203,753 LYs; and the expected 
melanoma treatment cost-savings ranged from $139 to $870 million.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this study provides the first quantitative estimates of the health benefits 
and melanoma treatment cost-savings of reducing indoor tanning in the United States. An 
age restriction for those younger than 18 years was estimated to avert 61,839 melanoma 
cases (4.9% of the total estimated cases), prevent 6735 melanoma deaths (4.7% of the total 
estimated deaths), and save $342.9 million in melanoma treatment costs over the lifetime of 
the 61.2 million youth age 14 years or younger in the United States. The estimated health 
benefits and melanoma treatment cost-savings increased as the prevalence of indoor tanning 
decreased. We estimate that an age restriction younger than 18 years reduced the prevalence 
of ever indoor tanning by 29%. Thus, the 20% reduction scenario represents the benefits if 
the age restriction were less effective in reducing indoor tanning, whereas the 50%, 80%, 
and 100% reduction scenarios represent estimates if the age restrictions were more effective 
in preventing individuals from ever indoor tanning.
As of July 2016, 13 states and the District of Columbia have restricted indoor tanning for all 
minors younger than 18 years. State laws in Oregon and Washington allow minors younger 
than 18 years to use indoor tanning facilities with a doctor’s prescription.22 Twelve 
additional states prohibit minors from indoor tanning at various ages younger than 18 years 
(ie, ages 14–17 years). Age restrictions are associated with lower rates of indoor tanning 
among minors, specifically the annual prevalence of indoor tanning among females was 
estimated to be 17% in states with age restrictions compared with 26% in states without age 
restrictions.23
A previous study conducted in Australia also using Markov modeling demonstrated that 
reductions in indoor tanning could result in favorable cost and health benefits. Specifically, 
the study estimated that among a cohort of 100,000 individuals aged 14 years or younger, an 
age restriction for those younger than 18 years and restrictions on use among those with fair 
skin could prevent 24 melanoma cases and save $53,169 (2014 US dollars) in melanoma 
treatment costs over the lifetime of the cohort.10 Their study placed a different value on 
benefits estimated to occur in the future. When applying the same value in our analysis, we 
estimate that an age restriction among those younger than 18 years would prevent 17 
melanoma cases and save $383,834 in melanoma treatment costs over the lifetime of a 
cohort of 100,000 individuals aged 14 years or younger in the United States. The estimated 
number of melanoma cases prevented is less in the United States than in Australia, which 
may be a result of the lower incidence rate of melanoma in the United States.24 Meanwhile, 
the estimated treatment cost saved was higher in the United States than in Australia, likely 
because of higher cancer treatment costs in the United States.19

 Additional comparisons of our results with other studies may be difficult because of 
different disease risk factors, population characteristics, and study methods. However, our 
estimates of LYs saved by reducing indoor tanning were comparable with other national 
preventive health services recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force.25 To 
illustrate, Fig 2 shows the expected LYs saved among the cohort of individuals age 14 years 
or younger in the United States from selected population-based preventive health services. 
Hypertension screening is estimated to result in 67,350 LY saved,26 similar to the estimate 
of 91,229 LYs saved from a 20% reduction in indoor tanning reported in this article. Further, 
the current study estimates that 142,659 LYs could be saved from an under-18-years age 
restriction, similar to influenza immunization services (146,945 LYs).26 Compared with 
other cancer-related preventive services, the estimated LYs saved from a 50% reduction in 
indoor tanning (228,990 LYs) was similar to the estimated LYs saved from colorectal cancer 
screening for people aged 50 years or older (251,032 LYs)26; and the estimated LYs saved 
from a 80% reduction indoor tanning (336,751 LYs) was similar to the estimated LYs saved 
from the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program for cervical cancer 
screening among women aged 18 to 64 years (367,751 LYs).27
This study is subject to some limitations. First, lifetime indoor tanning rates in our model 
were based on annual estimates and data from a published meta-analysis, because data on 
the probability of ever indoor tanning are not available. We accounted for uncertainty and 
variability around such estimates by conducting sensitivity analyses. Second, the cost 
analysis did not quantify the direct resources and costs needed for implementing 
interventions designed to reduce the prevalence of indoor tanning. Third, our analysis does 
not directly address compliance to laws restricting the use of indoor tanning among minors 
younger than 18 years. Poor compliance to indoor tanning laws as documented in the 
literature,28–30 could reduce the effectiveness of such laws. Lastly, our findings likely 
underestimate the health benefits and melanoma treatment cost-savings from reducing 
indoor tanning. We did not include the benefits from preventing in situ melanomas, 
subsequent primary melanomas, or other types of skin cancer such as basal cell and 
squamous cell carcinoma, for which indoor tanning is associated with an estimated 413,000 
cases each year in the United States.1 The benefits of reducing indoor tanning are also likely 
underestimated because we did not adjust future costs for inflation or estimate the costs 
associated with premature mortality.
Conclusions
Estimates from this study indicate that reducing indoor tanning would be effective in 
preventing a substantial number of melanoma cases and deaths, and result in melanoma 
treatment cost-savings. Because the benefits increase as the prevalence of indoor tanning 
decreases, further efforts to reduce indoor tanning might be effective in reducing the burden 
of melanoma in the United States. These findings help quantify and underscore the potential 
benefits of reducing indoor tanning and of continued public health efforts to identify and 
implement effective strategies to prevent melanoma.

Rates were converted to annual probabilities in TreeAge Pro 2014 Suite, Version 2.2 using the formula: probability = 1 − e(−rate). The minimum and the maximum for each parameter were used for 1-way 
sensitivity analyses.
*In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, parameters a and b for beta distribution were derived from the mean and SD in TreeAge Pro 2014 Suite, Version 2.2 (TreeAge Software Inc, Williamstown, MA) 
using the formulas: a = mean2 × (1 − mean)/(SD2); b = mean × (1 − mean)/(SD2) − a. The parameters mu and sigma for log-normal distribution were derived from the mean and SD using the formulas: mu 
= (ln [minimum] + ln [maximum])/2; sigma = (ln [maximum] − ln [minimum])/3.92. The parameters alpha and lambda for gamma distribution were derived from the mean and SD using the formulas: alpha 
= mean2/SD2; lambda = mean/SD2.
†The probability of ever indoor tanning between age 19–76 y increases with age and was imputed based the fitted exponential model: 
.
‡Melanoma incidence rates and melanoma mortality were obtained in 5-y age intervals. Both rates increased with age. The smallest rate (15–19 y) and the largest rate (≥85 y) are presented.
§All costs were adjusted to 2014 $US using the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index.20
