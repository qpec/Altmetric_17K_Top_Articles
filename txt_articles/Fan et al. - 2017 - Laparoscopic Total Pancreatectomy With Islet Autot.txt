IMPORTANCE Pain management of patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) can be challenging.
Laparoscopy has been associated with markedly reduced postoperative pain but has not
been widely applied to total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TPIAT).
OBJECTIVE To examine the feasibility of using laparoscopic TPIAT (L-TPIAT) in the treatment
of CP.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Thirty-two patients with CP presented for TPIAT at a
tertiary hospital from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2015. Of the 22 patients who
underwent L-TPIAT, 2 patients converted to an open procedure because of difficult anatomy
and prior surgery. Pain and glycemic outcomes were recorded at follow-up visits every 3 to 6
months postoperatively.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Operative outcomes included operative time, islet isolation
time, warm ischemia time, islet equivalent (IE) counts, estimated blood loss, fluid
resuscitation, and blood transfusions. Postoperative outcomes included length of stay,
all-cause 30-day readmission rate, postoperative complications, mortality rate, subjective
pain measurements, opioid use, random C-peptide levels, insulin requirements, and glycated
hemoglobin level.
RESULTS Of the 32 patients who presented for TPIAT, 20 underwent L-TPIAT (8 men and 12
women; mean [SD] age, 39 [13] years; age range, 21-58 years). Indication for surgery was CP
attributable to genetic mutation (n = 9), idiopathic pancreatitis (n = 6), idiopathic
pancreatitis with pancreas divisum (n = 3), and alcohol abuse (n = 2). Mean (SD) operative
time was 493 (78) minutes, islet isolation time was 185 (37) minutes, and warm ischemia time
was 51 (62) minutes. The mean (SD) IE count was 1325 (1093) IE/kg. The mean (SD) length of
stay was 11 (5) days, and the all-cause 30-day readmission rate was 35% (7 of 20 patients).
None of the patients experienced postoperative surgical site infection, hernia, or small-bowel
obstruction, and none died. Eighteen patients (90%) had a decrease or complete resolution
of pain, and 12 patients (60%) no longer required opioid therapy at a median follow-up
period of 6 months. Postoperative random insulin C-peptide levels were detectable in 19
patients (95%) at a median follow-up of 10.4 months. At a median follow-up of 12.5 months,
5 patients (25%) were insulin independent, whereas 9 patients (45%) required 1 to 10 U/d,
5 patients (25%) required 11 to 20 U/d, and 1 patient (5%) required greater than 20 U/d of
basal insulin. The mean (SD) glycated hemoglobin level was 7.4% (0.5%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study represents the first series of L-TPIAT,
demonstrating its safety and feasibility. Our approach enables patients to experience shorter
operative times and the benefits of laparoscopy, including reduced length of stay and quicker
opioid independence.

 P
atients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) can experience
long-standing and intractable abdominal pain.1 Total
pancreatectomy is a treatment option after medical
and endoscopic approaches have failed,2 but it results in life-
long insulin dependence. Total pancreatectomy with islet
autotransplantation (TPIAT)3 can be an effective treatment
for select patients to maintain endocrine function and pre-
vent postoperative brittle diabetes and diabetes-associated
complications.4
Laparoscopy has been found in other operations to be as-
sociated with markedly reduced pain and fewer postopera-
tive complications. For example, patients undergoing laparo-
scopic radical hysterectomy5 or cholecystectomy6 report
significantlylowerpostoperativepainintensitycomparedwith
patients undergoing the open versions of these procedures. In
addition, some studies have observed that patients undergo-
ing laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy7-9 or colon surgery10
experience significantly lower morbidity and shorter hospi-
tal stays than patients undergoing the open versions of these
procedures. We hypothesized that a totally laparoscopic TPIAT
(L-TPIAT) with simultaneous intraoperative islet isolation can
be a safe and effective approach to select patients with severe
CP, enabling them to experience the benefits of minimally in-
vasive surgery, such as reduced length of stay and quicker opi-
oid independence.
Methods
From January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2015, a total of
32 consecutive patients with CP presented for TPIAT and
were considered for the laparoscopic approach with intraop-
erative islet isolation. The indications for TPIAT are acute
recurrent idiopathic pancreatitis, painful chronic pancreati-
tis, and eliminating the risk of pancreatic cancer in a patient
at high risk. Although some of these patients are at increased
risk for pancreatic cancer development,11 there has only
been a single case report of autotransplantation of a pancre-
atic tumor after TPIAT.12 Patient demographic data collected
included sex, age, body mass index, prior abdominal opera-
tive history, and origin of CP. This study was approved by
the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board. All patients
provided written informed consent. Patient data were not
deidentified.
Operative outcomes documented were operative time, is-
let isolation time, warm ischemia time, islet equivalent (IE)
counts, estimated blood loss, fluid resuscitation, and blood
transfusions. Operative time was defined from incision time
to closure. Islet isolation time was defined from time of ces-
sation of blood flow to the pancreas to time of injection of is-
lets back into the patient. Warm ischemia time was defined
from time of cessation of blood flow to the pancreas to time
of flushing with cold University of Wisconsin solution. The is-
let counting method changed during the study period from au-
tomated to manual counting because of falsely elevated islet
counts using the automated method. As a result, the reported
mean IE count only represents the IEs measured from 4 of the
most recent patients undergoing L-TPIAT.
Postoperative outcomes included length of stay, all-
cause 30-day readmission rate, postoperative complications,
mortality rate, subjective pain measurements, opioid use, ran-
dom C-peptide levels (laboratory assay with lower limit of
0.1 ng/mL [to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by
0.331]),insulinrequirements,andglycatedhemoglobin(HbA1c)
levels. Pain measurements were collected at follow-up visits
using a questionnaire that asked patients to rate their pain on
a 100-point visual analog scale (with 0 indicating no pain and
100 indicating the most pain).
Surgical Technique
Webeganbyplacinga12-mmportinferiortotheumbilicus,fol-
lowed by a pair of ports on each side of the abdomen using a
12-mm port in the surgeon’
s right hand and a 5-mm port in the
surgeon’
slefthandfromeachrespectiveside.A10-mm,45°lapa-
roscope was used for visualization. The lesser sac was ac-
cessed through the gastrocolic ligament. The gastroduodenal
artery was skeletonized; two 5-mm white, plastic locking clips
were placed on the proximal artery; and a 10-mm metal clip ap-
plier was applied distal to these clips. The gastroduodenal ar-
tery was divided with a vessel sealant device distally. The por-
tal vein was then dissected from above the pancreas, and the
superior mesenteric vein was dissected from below. A tunnel
behind the pancreatic neck was created. The stomach was di-
vided just proximal to the pylorus with a laparoscopic stapling
device with green or black loads. A cholecystectomy was per-
formed,andthecommonbileductwasdividedproximaltothe
entry site of the cystic duct, which enabled the gallbladder to
remain with the specimen for subsequent extraction.
The neck of the pancreas was divided after ensuring the
safety of the portal vein and the superior mesenteric vein.
Division of the pancreas neck facilitates division of the supe-
rior mesenteric artery margin, allows a staged removal for
the back table team, and enables easy cannulation of the
pancreatic duct for collagenase infusion into the duct. We
then performed a Kocher maneuver to free the ligament of
Treitz from the right side, marching distally on the duode-
num. After approximately 20 cm of jejunum was delivered
to the right side of the ligament of Treitz, the jejunum was
divided with a laparoscopic stapling device with a white load
(2.5 mm). The small-bowel mesentery was divided in the
Key Points
Question Is laparoscopic total pancreatectomy with islet
autotransplantation and intraoperative islet separation a feasible
treatment for patients with chronic pancreatitis?
Findings In this case series of 20 patients, patients undergoing
laparoscopic total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation
experienced shorter total operative and islet isolation times,
reduced length of stay, and quicker opioid independence
compared with patients undergoing open or robotic-assisted total
pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation.
Meaning Laparoscopic total pancreatectomy with islet
autotransplantation is a feasible alternative treatment for patients
with chronic pancreatitis.

 proximal direction to the uncinate and along the superior
mesenteric artery margin until the Whipple specimen was
free. It was extracted through the umbilicus by extending
the 12-mm port slightly. The specimen was passed to the
laboratory team to infuse the gastroduodenal artery with
collagenase and to clean off the pancreas head and cut it into
pieces.
Distal Pancreatectomy
The body and tail of the pancreas were mobilized along with
the spleen. The splenic vessels were divided, beginning, when
possible, with the splenic artery followed by the splenic vein.
Onceextracted,thedistalpancreaswasalsoperfused,cleaned,
and dissected into small pieces on the back table before being
processed by the islet laboratory personnel.
We previously reported our hepaticojejunostomy recon-
struction technique with a single layer of 4-0 barbed sutures
in the anterior with interrupted barbed sutures and suture
clips.13 The gastrojejunostomy was then performed in an an-
tecolicretrogastricmanneralongtheposteriorwallofthestom-
ach in a stapled side-to-side technique with a laparoscopic sta-
pler. Beginning in 2014, we routinely added a Braun
jejunojejunostomy to the procedure to mitigate bile acid re-
flux gastritis unopposed by pancreatic bicarbonate secretion,
which is eliminated with the total pancreatectomy.
Intraoperative Laboratory Isolation
Pancreas digestion and autologous islet isolation followed a
modified version of the method described by Ricordi et al.14
On the back table in the operating room, the head was
flushed through the gastroduodenal artery and the tail
through the splenic arteries with cold University of Wiscon-
sin solution. The pancreatic duct of each half was cannu-
lated and distended via the duct with a prewarmed mixture
of collagenase and thermolysin (GMP Grade Liberase MTF
C/T, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd). The pancreas was then
divided into 1- to 2-cm2 pieces, placed in a 600-mL digestion
chamber (Biorep Technologies), and transferred to a Ricordi
Islet Isolator (Biorep Technologies). Collagenase was main-
tained at 37°C and circulated through the digestion chamber
while samples were periodically removed, stained with
dithizone (Sigma-Aldrich Co), and viewed under a micro-
scope. Digestion was stopped by the introduction of cold
RPMI 1640 (Mediatech Inc). The mixture of islets and acinar
tissue was collected, washed, and resuspended in 5% human
serum albumin supplemented with 70 U/kg of heparin. Final
islet counts were initially determined using an automated
islet counter (Biorep Technologies). Later in the study, the
standard manual counting method was used instead.15 The
islets were transferred to an infusion bag and delivered into
the portal circulation by gravity flow.
Islet Infusion
Simultaneous with the hepaticojejunostomy and gastrojeju-
nostomy, the islets were prepared in the laboratory in the
operating room. When the islet solution was ready for auto-
transplantation into the liver, a metal, hollow-bore, 16-gauge
needle with intravenous tubing attached was placed through
a 12-mm port site. From within the peritoneal cavity, laparo-
scopic instruments were used to place the needle into the
splenic or portal vein. The islet infusion was then delivered,
the needle was subsequently removed, and direct pressure
was applied to the puncture site of the vein to achieve
hemostasis. Pressures in the portal vein were constantly
monitored. Of note, for all advanced laparoscopic pancreas
procedures, a No. 10 blade scalpel and Mayo scissors were
always kept on the Mayo stand in case a rapid conversion to
an open procedure was necessary.
Glycemic Control
All participants were postoperatively admitted to a surgical in-
tensive care unit and administered intravenous insulin infu-
sion and dextrose-containing intravenous fluids for tight glu-
cosecontrol.Onpostoperativeday3,patientsweretransitioned
to subcutaneous insulin injections. When stable for dis-
charge, all patients were maintained with at least basal insu-
linunlesscontraindicatedbecauseofhypoglycemia.Thiscom-
monpracticeisthoughttoresttheisletsaftertransplant.Insulin
therapy was continued for at least 3 months after TPIAT,16 at
which time patients underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance
test. If testing indicated no diabetes, an attempt was made to
discontinue use of insulin or to transition to oral hypoglyce-
mic therapy. All participants returned for regular clinic visits
and additional oral glucose tolerance testing every 3 to 6
months after TPIAT.
Statistical Analysis
We used a univariate linear regression model and the Pearson
correlation coefficient to analyze the trends in L-TPIAT opera-
tivetimesandisletisolationtimesduringthe2013to2015study
period. The level of significance used was P < .05. R statisti-
cal software (version 3.0.2; The R Foundation) was used for
all statistical analyses.

Patient Demographic Data and Indications for TPIAT
Of the 32 patients who presented for TPIAT, 20 underwent
L-TPIAT (8 men and 12 women; mean [SD] age, 39 [13] years;
agerange,21-58years).Twopatientsconvertedtotheopenpro-
cedure because of difficult anatomy and prior surgery. Causes
of CP included gene mutation(s) (n = 9), idiopathic pancreati-
tis(n = 6),idiopathicpancreatitiswithpancreasdivisum(n = 3),
and alcohol abuse (n = 2) (Table 1). The 9 patients with gene
mutations included 2 with protease, serine 1 (PRSS1) (OMIM
276000), 2 with serine peptidase inhibitor, Kazal type 1
(SPINK1)(OMIM167790),2withcysticfibrosistransmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR) (OMIM 602421), 2 transhetero-
zygotes with both SPINK1 and CFTR, and 1 transheterozygote
with both SPINK1 and PRSS1.
Operative Factors and Postoperative Outcomes
The mean (SD) operative time was 493 (78) minutes (Table 2).
Islet isolation time was limited to a mean (SD) of 185 (37) min-
utes with a mean (SD) warm ischemia time of 51 (62) minutes.
The mean (SD) IE count was 1325 (1093) IE/kg. The mean (SD)
length of stay was 11 (5) days, and all-cause 30-day readmis-
sion rate was 35% (7 of 20 patients). None of the patients ex-
periencedapostoperativesurgicalsiteinfection,hernia,small-
bowel obstruction, or mortality. Eighteen patients (90%) had
adecreaseorcompleteresolutionofpain,and12patients(60%)
no longer required opioid therapy at a median follow-up pe-
riod of 6 months. Preoperative pain scores ranged from 0 to
100, with a mean score of 40.75. Postoperative pain scores
ranged from 0 to 50, with a mean score of 7.5. As a result, the
mean decrease in pain score postoperatively was 33.25.
Furthermore, the Figure illustrates the downward trend in
L-TPIAT operative times (R = −0.51, P = .02) and islet isola-
tion times (R = −0.45, P = .04) from 2013 to 2015.
Glycemic Outcomes
The time point for glycemic outcomes was 1 year after L-TPIAT
or at last follow-up visit for those with more recent opera-
tions (all patients had undergone surgery in at least the pre-
vious 6 months, and 3 were not yet at 1 year after surgery). The
median follow-up time was 12.5 months (range, 199-482 days;
interquartile range, 333-406 days). At follow-up, 5 patients
(25%) were insulin independent. Of the remaining 15 patients
who required insulin, all were receiving basal insulin therapy
with a median daily dose of 10 U (range, 4-34 U; interquartile
range, 7-13 U): 9 patients (60%) required 1 to 10 U/d, 5 pa-
tients (33%) required 11 to 20 U/d, and 1 patient (7%) required
greater than 20 U/d of basal insulin. Furthermore, of the 15 pa-
tients requiring insulin therapy at follow-up, 6 (40%) re-
quired no bolus insulin, 2 (13%) required sliding scale insulin
as needed, and 7 (47%) required nutritional insulin. Of note,
at follow-up, 5 cohort participants (25%) were receiving oral
hypoglycemic therapy: 2 of 5 patients (40%) in the insulin-
independent group who had prediabetes and 3 of 15 patients
(20%) in the insulin-dependent group who had diabetes.
At follow-up, the overall mean (SD) HbA1c level was 7.4%
(0.5%) (to convert to proportion of hemoglobin, multiply by
0.01), with measurement of HbA1c occurring within 1 month
of the assessment of insulin regimen for all patients except for

Discussion
Safe and Feasible
This study represents the first series of L-TPIAT. Table 3 sum-
marizes our study compared with other surgical approaches.
In our series, we observed a shorter mean operative time, is-
let isolation time, and length of stay and quicker opioid inde-
pendence. Recently, robotic-assisted TPIAT has been pro-
posed as an approach that enables patients to receive the
benefits of minimally invasive surgery.20 Although this is one
strategy, we describe the feasibility of a totally laparoscopic
approach that avoids the high costs and consumption of op-
erating room resources associated with robotic-assisted
surgery.21
CP Pain and Benefits of Laparoscopy
Pain associated with CP continues to be a major clinical chal-
lenge. It is recognized that ongoing pain in patients with CP
may induce central sensitization or pronociceptive pain modu-
lation. This pain modulation may manifest as spreading
hyperalgesia.22,23 Ultimately, this process may become en-
tirely independent of nociceptive input and inhibitory pain
modulation, leading to an autonomous pain state.24 The treat-
ment of pain in patients with CP is usually based on the World

 Health Organization pain treatment ladder, which typically
ends with opioid treatment. Opioids may provide effective an-
algesia in some patients with CP but may have considerable
adverseeffectsandmayeveninducemorehyperalgesia.25Pain
treatments recommended in these cases should directly tar-
get the central nervous system (eg, tricyclic antidepressants
or gabapentin and intravenous ketamine).26-29 Patients un-
dergoingTPIATusuallypresentwithseverechronicpain,which
can make surgical pain difficult to manage. In addition, the
spikeinpostoperativepaincancomplicateshort-termandlong-
term pain management. In addition, L-TPIAT can be particu-
larly beneficial to patients with chronic pain because it may
reduce the surgical pain spike at the time. In other opera-
tions,laparoscopyisassociatedwithmarkedlyreducedpain,5,6
morbidity, and length of hospital stay.7-10 In our series, opioid
independence after L-TPIAT was achieved more quickly than
in the other TPIAT series (Table 3).
Role of Intraoperative Isolation
We hypothesized that the islet isolation laboratory could be set
up in the operating room to effectively eliminate transit time,
rapidly isolate islets, and enable real-time coordination of in-
traoperative infusion. Although it is unknown whether added
transit time to a neighboring laboratory has an effect on out-
comes, performing the isolation in the operating room stream-
linestheprocessandmayreducetheriskofhand-offerror.Some
centersmayalreadyhavenegligibletransittimesgiventheprox-
imity of their laboratory to the operating room; however, other
centers still use remote facilities. Intraoperative isolation may
have contributed to our efficient total operative times. In ad-
dition,isletisolationtimeincludeswarmandcoldischemiatime.
Corlett and Scharp30 found that after 45 minutes of warm is-
chemia time, islet counts decreased to 45.7% in rats and 52.5%
indogs.After90minutes,isletcountsdecreasedto15.6%inrats
and 23.9% in dogs. Pileggi et al31 found that islet yield and vi-
abilityweresignificantlyreducedinratmodelsinthelong,cold
ischemia time group. Thus, minimizing islet isolation time in-
creases islet count and viability, which is positively correlated
with insulin independence after TPIAT.18
Learning Curve
A difficult learning curve is associated with laparoscopic
pancreaticoduodenectomy. We noted that our experience in
performing more than 400 laparoscopic distal pancreatec-
tomies and more than 100 laparoscopic pancreaticoduode-
nectomies aided our performance in L-TPIAT. As we con-
tinue to perform laparoscopic pancreas surgery, we are
constantly revising our technique to be more efficient and
safe. During the 3 years we have been performing L-TPIATs,
our operative times have decreased significantly (Figure).
This improvement is most likely attributable to multiple fac-
tors, including surgeon experience and more efficient islet
isolation, which also led to a significant decrease in islet iso-
lation times (Figure).
Limitations
This series has some important limitations. First, our method
for IE measurement changed during the study period from au-
tomated to manual counting. Despite the low mean IE count
of 1325 IE/kg for the 4 valid manual islet counts, our glycemic
outcomes were similar to 1-year insulin independence rates re-
ported in the literature.32 Second, not all patients were can-
didates for L-TPIAT. During the study period, 6 patients were
only offered open surgery because of extensive disease or pre-
vious complex surgery. In particular, we found that prior nec-
rotizing and severe pancreatitis can be a relative contraindi-
cation to the minimally invasive approach. Third, we do not
report 5- or 10-year outcomes given the recent description of
L-TPIAT.
Conclusions
We describe the feasibility and safety in this first series of
L-TPIAT with intraoperative islet isolation. Although
L-TPIAT tends to be considered after medical, endoscopic,
and traditional surgical approaches have failed, it should be
considered earlier given that early surgical intervention of 2
to 3 years or less is associated with improved pain control in
patients with CP.33,34 Prior pancreatic surgery has also been
found to reduce islet yields and increase insulin require-
ments in patients who subsequently undergo TPIAT.35
Overall, the L-TPIAT approach enables patients to experi-
ence shorter operative times and the benefits of laparos-
copy, including reduced length of stay and quicker opioid
independence.

Critical Issues in Surgical Approach and Isolation Site
for Islet Autotransplantation
Chirag S. Desai, MD; Khalid M. Khan, MD
Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TPIAT)
is the most appropriate option for patients with refractory
chronic or recurrent pancreatitis with the primary aims of con-
trolling pain, preventing brittle type 3C diabetes, and mitigat-
ing the risk of pancreatic
cancer. The quality of life im-
proves significantly after the
procedure in adults and children.1,2 The timing of TPIAT in re-
lation to the natural history of disease is critical although not
universally agreed on. The ideal time is when maximum islet
yield can be obtained while restoring the patient’
s life to nor-
malcy, although that time is often modified by the progress of
thediseaseatpresentation,patientsymptoms,andpatientpre-
paredness to undergo major surgery. Outcomes of TPIAT can
beinfluencedbypreviousprocedures,surgicaloperations,and
dependence and duration of narcotic requirements, which
should be kept in mind when determining the timing of
surgery.3
Laparoscopic TPIAT as described by Fan et al4 appears to
benefit patients and represents a natural extension to the stan-
dard surgical procedure. The main benefit of the technique is
to reduce postoperative pain, and the procedure offers
