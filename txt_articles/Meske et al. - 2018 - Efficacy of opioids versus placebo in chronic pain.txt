Introduction: Opioids have been used for millennia for the treatment of pain. However, the 
long-term efficacy of opioids to treat chronic non-cancer pain continues to be debated. To evaluate 
opioids’ efficacy in chronic non-cancer pain, we performed a meta-analysis of published clinical 
trials for μ-opioid receptor agonists performed for US Food and Drug Administration approval. 
Methods: MEDLINE and Cochrane trial register were searched for enriched enrollment ran-
domized withdrawal studies (before June 2016). Selection criteria included: adults, ≥10 subjects 
per arm, any chronic pain condition, double-blind treatment period lasting ≥12 weeks, and all 
μ-agonist opioids approved in the USA. 
Results: Fifteen studies met criteria. Opioid efficacy was statistically significant (p<0.001) 
versus placebo for pain intensity (standardized mean difference: −0.416), ≥30% and ≥50% 
improvement in pain (risk difference: 0.166 and 0.137), patient global impression of change 
(0.163), and patient global assessment of study medication (0.194). There were minor benefits 
on physical function and no effect on mental function. 
Conclusion: Opioids are efficacious in the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain for up to 3 
months in randomized controlled trials. This should be considered, alongside data on opioid 
safety, in the use of opioids for the treatment of chronic pain.
Keywords: opioid analgesics, non-cancer pain, long-term efficacy, EERW trials, opioid efficacy;

Introduction
Opioids have been used for millennia for the treatment of pain and remain an important 
therapeutic option. While the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American 
Pain Society, the US Federation of State Medical Boards, and the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention endorse the use of opioids, when appropriate, for the treatment 
of chronic pain, efficacy of long-term opioid use remains controversial.1–6 In addition, 
there are significant risks associated with opioids and these agents have contributed 
to the epidemic of opioid abuse, addiction, and overdose deaths in the USA.7–10 Given 
these serious risks, the assessment of evidence for the long-term analgesic efficacy of 
opioids for treating chronic pain is crucial.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled studies of at least 3 months’ duration in order to approve an opioid 
for the treatment of chronic pain. This reflects the need to balance accrual of sufficient 
data representative of long-term treatment against the scientific and ethical challenges 
of longer-term randomized, placebo-controlled trials, including dropouts, missing 
data, concomitant treatments, and long-term use of placebo. The 3-month duration is

the standard clinical trial duration accepted by the FDA for 
many chronic conditions including hypertension, asthma, 
depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and anxiety.
In order to inform the ongoing controversy over whether 
there is evidence that opioids are efficacious for the treatment 
of chronic pain, we have gathered the randomized controlled 
trials required by the FDA for approval, and have performed 
a meta-analysis of their results. These trials are by regulatory 
expectation 3 months in duration. This review does not address 
the risks of opioids. A coherent position on the risk–benefit 
balance of opioids for the treatment of chronic pain requires 
an accurate and data-driven assessment of both their risks 
and their benefits. Thus, the purpose of this review is not to 
minimize, or characterize, the risks of opioids, but rather to 
ensure that the debate over the risks and benefits of opioids is 
informed by an accurate assessment of their benefits.
Methods
Data sources and searches
MEDLINE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials 2012 were searched for all relevant studies published 
before June 2016. The search strategy for MEDLINE is pre-
sented (see Methods in Supplementary materials) and was 
customized for the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials 2012 (in which only the Intervention and Popula-
tion sections were used). Additional studies were identified 
through the examination of references from identified trials, 
systematic reviews, and authors’ own databases.
We searched for enriched enrollment randomized with-
drawal (EERW) studies published in English with double-
blinded outcome assessments that compared any opioid 
(including combinations and dual mechanism analgesics 
administered via the oral, transdermal, nasal, sublingual, 
or transmucosal routes) to placebo for ≥12 weeks during 
the randomized double-blind treatment phase of the study 
in patients with any chronic non-malignant pain condition.
Study selection
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Trials with participants ≥18 years of age with any type of 
chronic nonmalignant pain, including but not limited to 
chronic low back pain (CLBP), chronic neuropathic pain, 
diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP), osteoarthritis 
(OA), arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, phantom limb pain, 
fibromyalgia, post-herpetic neuralgia, or musculoskel-
etal pain. Studies of acute or post-surgical pain and cancer 
pain were excluded. Studies of specific μ-agonist opioids, 
μ-agonist opioids with additional pharmacological activity 
(eg, tramadol and tapentadol), or combination opioids (eg, 
hydrocodone/acetaminophen) approved for the treatment of 
pain were included. Agents with oral, transdermal, nasal, 
sublingual, or transmucosal routes of administration were 
included. Studies were included if they had a minimum of 
10 patients per arm and reported pain intensity (PI) as an 
outcome. The present study protocol has been published 
on PROSPERO (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/; 
registration No: CRD42015026378).
Selection methodology
Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts using 
the Abstrackr software to identify manuscripts that met the 
abovementioned inclusion criteria.11 Full-text articles were 
obtained for manuscripts that appeared to meet the inclusion 
criteria or were likely to meet the inclusion criteria. The full 
text of these manuscripts was read to determine final inclu-
sion in the meta-analysis. Any disagreement on manuscript 
inclusion was resolved through discussion among the authors.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Data extraction methodology
Two authors independently extracted data from each manu-
script using the Systematic Review Data Repository (SRDR) 
form (http://srdr.ahrq.gov/; retrieved: June 1 2016). A third 
author subsequently confirmed that primary and secondary 
endpoints matched the SRDR form. The SRDR is an open 
collaborative web-based repository for systematic data review. 
The SRDR form was developed to include participant charac-
teristics, interventions, treatment arms, adverse events (AEs), 
primary and secondary outcomes, country(s) of study, number 
of study sites, trial design, blinding, clinical setting, method 
of recruitment, group similarities at baseline, and assessment 
bias. If data were not available or incomplete, manuscript 
authors were contacted to provide the missing data.
Quality assessment
Risk of bias was assessed based on the guidelines avail-
able through the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool of the SRDR 
(http://handbook.cochrane.org/chapter_8/table_8_5_a_
the_cochrane_collaborations_tool_for_assessi ng.htm). We 
defined high-quality studies (ie, low bias studies) as those 
with no major methodological flaws that fulfilled 6 or more 
of the 11 internal validity criteria.12
Data extracted
The following outcome measures were extracted from the 
selected publications: change in PI score from randomization

Meta-analysis: opioids in chronic pain
baseline to week 12 or study endpoint, categorical evaluation 
of responders/non-responders (≥30% and ≥50% improvement 
as calculated based on changes between week 12 and pain 
at the beginning of the open-label titration phase), patient 
assessments of global improvement (eg, patient global 
impression of pain [PGIC] and patient global assessment of 
study medication [PGASM]), assessment of patient change 
in function (eg, Roland–Morris Disability Questionnaire 
[RMDQ] and Western Ontario and McMaster Universi-
ties Arthritis Index [WOMAC]), rescue medication dose 
consumption, and health-related quality of life (eg, 36-Item 
Short-Form Survey [SF-36]).
Safety outcomes collected included: the proportion of 
patients with ≥1 AE, ≥1 serious AE (SAE), discontinuing 
treatment due to AEs and/or withdrawal symptoms post-
randomization; AEs during the open-label titration phase 
were not collected.
Data synthesis and analysis
The primary outcome was standardized effect size, defined 
as the treatment difference (mean difference in PI score 
between active and placebo) divided by the SD. We pooled 
data from all manuscripts regardless of whether the endpoint 
was presented as mean change from randomization baseline 
to week 12 or as the least squares mean difference (LSMD) 
at week 12; if both results were available, the mean change 
from randomization baseline to week 12 was used. The 
mean change from baseline was calculated from the reported 
mean baseline and week 12 data; the SD of the change was 
calculated by assuming a correlation of 0.50 between base-
line and week 12 responses. The standard mean difference 
(SMD) was calculated with 95% CIs. The change in PI from 
randomization baseline to week 12 was reported as the LSMD 
and standard error (SE); in case SD or SE were not available, 
they were calculated based on the following formula: SE = 
SD/square root (N). When SD values were not available, the 
manuscript authors were contacted. We were able to obtain all 
unpublished SD values. The number of subjects randomized 
was used in all analyses except in situations where a different 
N value was more appropriate to use (eg, some manuscripts 
did not present data for 100% of patients in PGIC tables; 
in this situation, we calculated the total number of patients 
randomized based on the percentage of reporting patients).
A binary random-effects meta-analysis using the restricted 
maximum likelihood method was conducted to assess ≥30% 
and ≥50% responder rates. The results are reported as risk dif-
ferences (RDs). The same approach was used for PGIC results 
(combining “very much improved” and “much improved” 
responses) and PGASM (combining “excellent” and “very 
good” results). Function endpoints were not reported in all 
manuscripts, and for manuscripts that did report function 
endpoints, a variety of different measures were used (RMDQ, 
WOMAC, and Oswestry Disability Index). Therefore, no 
meta-analysis was performed; instead, these data were pre-
sented in a tabular format. Quality of life measures (mean 
change from baseline to week 12; SF-36 or SF-12v2) were 
combined and a meta-analysis was conducted using a linear 
regression model. The numbers of patients who discontinued 
treatment due to an AE were subjected to a binary random-
effects meta-analysis using the restricted maximum likelihood 
method. The results are presented as RDs. In order to assess 
the percent of patients who benefited from the study drug, a 
weighted mean was calculated for the percentage of patients 
who met inclusion criteria (ie, found the study drug both 
efficacious and tolerable) and were randomized to the random-
ized double-blind treatment phase. The statistical analysis was 
performed using the OpenMetaAnalyst Software.13
Meta-analysis findings
A total of 2,018 references were identified from our search; 
of these, 26 full-text articles were obtained for screening and 
15 met our inclusion criteria (Figure 1).14–28

Included studies
A summary of the characteristics of EERW trials included 
in the meta-analysis is presented in Table 1 and Table S1. 
Fourteen of the 15 studies were considered high-quality stud-
ies (having low bias; Table S2). Hydrocodone was evaluated 
in 4 trials; oxymorphone, oxycodone, buprenorphine and 
tapentadol in 2 trials each; and hydromorphone, morphine/
naltrexone, and tramadol in 1 trial each. CLBP was evalu-
ated in 10 studies, DPNP in 2 studies, OA in 2 studies, and 
1 study evaluated a combination of CLBP and OA patients.
Study design
All included studies were randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled EERW studies as defined by the literature search 
inclusion criteria. All included studies used a parallel group 
design during the randomized double-blind treatment phase. In 
13 of the 15 trials, patients were initially titrated to an individu-
alized effective dose and then either allowed to continue their 
individualized dose or randomized to the placebo group during 
the randomized double-blind treatment phase. In 1 trial,14 all 
patients were titrated to the highest dose of the study drug and 
subsequently randomized to a high-dose group, a low-dose 
group, or the placebo group. In another trial,15 all patients were 
allowed to adjust the titrated dose after randomization for the 
first 4 weeks and then the dose was fixed for the next 8 weeks.
The open-label titration phase lasted between 2 and 8 
weeks and the randomized double-blind treatment phase 
lasted 12 weeks for all studies (Table 1). Most studies made

Meta-analysis: opioids in chronic pain
efforts to prevent or reduce discontinuation of patients ran-
domized to the placebo group in the randomized double-blind 
treatment phase by allowing the use of rescue medication 
(12/15) and/or tapering the opioid in placebo patients (10/15; 
Table 1). All studies analyzed the intent-to-treat population 
for primary and secondary outcomes.
Efficacy
Primary endpoint: PI
With regard to primary endpoint measurements, the change 
from randomization baseline to week 12 was reported by 4 
studies as the LSMD,14,16–18 and by all other studies as the 
mean change (Table S1).15,19–28 The effect of opioids was 
statistically significant (p<0.001) versus placebo for the 
change in PI score from randomization baseline to week 
12 (SMD=−0.416; 95% CI: −0.521 to −0.312; Figure 2) as 
assessed by binary random-effects model meta-analysis using 
the restricted maximum likelihood method. Only 1 study15 did 
not report a statistically significant difference versus placebo 
for the mean change in PI from randomization baseline to 
week 12 (Figure 2); however, the change in area under the 
curve between study drug and placebo, which was the study’s 
primary endpoint, was statistically significant.
Other efficacy endpoints
Responder rates were reported in 12 manuscripts (Tables S3 
and S4).16–19,22–28 However, 2 were excluded since they reported 
respondent analysis as increment in pain from baseline of the

3). PGIC was reported in 5 manuscripts16–18,23,25 (Tables S3 
and S4) and meta-analysis combining patients “very much 
improved” and “much improved” showed a statistically sig-
nificant difference between study drug and placebo in PGIC 
(RD estimate [SE]: 0.163 [0.029], p<0.001; Table 2). PGASM 
was assessed in 5 manuscripts,14,15,19,21,24 (Tables S3 and S4) and 
meta-analysis combining “excellent” and “very good” response 
showed a statistically significant difference between study drug

1 manuscript25 reported functional outcomes on the Brief Pain

Meta-analysis: opioids in chronic pain
measure used, no meta-analysis was performed. Of these 5 
manuscripts reporting functional data, 2 showed a greater 
improvement in function in the study drug group compared to 
placebo.22,25 Quality of life data were reported in only 3 manu-
scripts16,18,25 (Tables S3 and S4); therefore, no meta-analysis 
was performed. Physical component summary values were 
greater for study drug than for placebo in all 3 manuscripts 
(10.11 vs 6.12, 0.1 vs −2.3, and 7.52 vs 3.62), while mental 
component  
summary values were greater for study drug versus 
placebo for 2 manuscripts16,25 (7.19 vs 3.34 and 0.20 vs −0.8; 
Table S3). No meta-analysis of rescue medication dose con-
sumption was conducted due to insufficient data. The overall 
weighted mean (SD) of the percentage of patients who were 
randomized from the open-label titration phase was 63.2% 
(7.4). Data are presented for each manuscript in Table 1.
Safety endpoints
Reported AEs and SAEs post-randomization were similar 
between study drug and placebo in all studies (Table 3). The 
overall weighted mean discontinuation rate was numerically 
higher for placebo (42.1%) than study drug (31.0%), and 
was likely related to discontinuation due to lack of efficacy 
in the placebo group. There was a small but statistically 
significant difference in the percentage of patients who 
discontinued due to an AE in the study drug group ver-
sus the placebo group (RD estimate [SE]: 0.021 [0.008], 
p=0.011). The proportion of patients who discontinued 
due to SAEs was not included in this analysis because no 
manuscript reported it. The average rate of discontinuation 
due to opioid withdrawal was similar between study drug 
and placebo (Table 3).

Discussion
The recent claims that opioids lack efficacy for chronic 
pain have created controversy among physicians, prescrib-
ers, regulators, scientists, and the general public regarding 
whether the benefits of opioid use outweigh the public health 
risks of abuse and other complications.27–30 Chou et al state 
“evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of 
long-term opioid therapy for improving pain” based on the 
opinion that studies of ≤1 year duration do not provide evi-
dence of “long-term” efficacy.4 Clearly if there is no benefit 
then no amount of risk should be tolerated. This review was, 
therefore, performed in order to gather together the key 
evidence to facilitate understanding opioid efficacy within 
the paradigm of FDA studies required for approval, and to 
perform a meta-analysis in order to quantify opioid efficacy 
for chronic pain and assess consistency of effects across stud-
ies conducted for ≥3 months’ duration. This meta-analysis 
was limited to EERW-designed studies, since this design is 
by far the most commonly utilized for regulatory approval 
and therefore supports combinability.
Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses regarding 
the efficacy of opioids in chronic pain have been published; 
however, these studies were published nearly a decade 
ago4,31–33 and the more recent ones are not meta-analyses.4,34,35 
Additionally, many studies included in previous reviews 
are not relevant to our study because they report alternate 
routes of administration (eg, intravenous),4 have short study 
durations,31,36 are open-label32,34 or observational studies,35 
have restricted pain types,33,36 or compare different study 
designs.31,33,36 Although most of these meta-analyses con-
cluded that opioids were efficacious for the treatment of 
chronic non-cancer pain,31–34,36 a review specifically focused 
on studies designed for FDA approval (ie, of ≥3 months’ 
duration) for chronic pain has not been done.
The EERW design provides an opportunity to evaluate 
both “effectiveness” (outcomes in the open-label titration 
phase) and “efficacy” (outcomes in the randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled phase). The present meta-analysis 
demonstrated the “effectiveness” of opioids since a major-
ity of patients (63%) demonstrated a clinically meaningful 
response. The pharmacological efficacy of opioids for the 
treatment of chronic pain was evidenced by statistically 
significant differences between study drug and placebo in 
change in pain score from randomization to week 12 and in 
response rates.
With regard to secondary endpoints, opioids were found 
to marginally improve physical function in the present meta-
analysis. Therefore, the use of opioids alone to improve 
physical function is not supported by this review; whether 
opioids improve the effectiveness of rehabilitative treat-
ments for chronic pain requires further study. Opioids did 
not have an appreciable positive or negative effect on mood. 
The PGASM measure allows subjects to aggregate multiple 
aspects of their experience, including pain relief, improve-
ment in physical and emotional function, side effects, and 
convenience, into a single measure.37 In the present meta-
analysis, these measures were congruent with the primary 
finding that opioids are efficacious for the treatment of 
chronic non-cancer pain. However, it is worth noting that 
the forest plot (Figure 2) showed that the efficacy estimates 
appear heterogeneous across studies. While the reasons for 
this are not certain, possible reasons include differences in 
study design methodology, inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
statistical analyses, concomitant and rescue medications, 
dosing, and numerous other factors.
It is worth noting that AE rates in the double-blind periods 
were similar between study drug and placebo, with dropouts 
due to AEs being higher in the drug group while dropouts 
due to loss of efficacy were higher in the placebo group. 
However, because patients with significant tolerability issues 
during the open-label titration phase are deliberately excluded 
from the randomized double-blind treatment phase, AE rates 
in the randomized double-blind treatment phase of EERW 
studies do not represent rates that would occur in prospec-
tive parallel clinical trials;38 however, AE rates may be more 
reflective of ongoing AE rates in clinical practice, where, 
like in the EERW designs, patients with poor tolerability or 
efficacy are taken off treatment with opioids relatively early 
after a trial of therapy.
In a recent meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy of opi-
oids for CLBP
, the authors concluded that opioids provided 
“moderate short-term relief” but the effect is not clinically 
important.39 In that meta-analysis, Shaheed et al define “clini-
cally important” arbitrarily as a group mean difference in pain 
or disability >20 points on a 0–100 scale,39 while clinical 
importance is more usefully viewed as a multidimensional 
concept that encompasses multiple factors including efficacy, 
safety, and availability of other treatments.40 It is worth noting 
that the efficacy of opioids is at least as large as that of any 
other treatment for chronic pain.38 Thus, requiring a group 
mean difference of 20 points on a 0–100 pain scale would 
lead to a nihilistic conclusion that no pharmacological treat-
ments for chronic pain are useful.While the effectiveness of 
existing treatments for chronic pain leaves plenty of room 
for improvement, and considering that only a small minority 
of patients do not experience clinically meaningful treat-

Meta-analysis: opioids in chronic pain
ment responses, discarding entirely all analgesics approved 
for chronic pain contradicts numerous treatment guidelines, 
international treatment guidelines, widespread patient experi-
ence, and the FDA approval process.
These authors, as well as others,4 defined a 12-week treat-
ment period as “short-term.” While 3 months is indeed short 
in comparison to the years patients may use opioid treatment 
for chronic pain, 3-month treatment periods are considered 
the regulatory standard for assessing long-term efficacy of 
a treatment in placebo-controlled clinical trials of chronic 
conditions.41 Indeed, the efficacy of all major drug and non-
drug therapies for chronic pain is based on a similar body 
of evidence (ie, the number of studies and duration of those 
studies are similar for all chronic pain treatments).42 Thus, 
the body of evidence for the efficacy of opioids is similar in 
terms of duration of studies to that for other approved classes 
of analgesics.42
The 3-month trial duration is not entirely arbitrary: beyond 
several months, the internal validity of clinical trials tends to 
degrade due to dropouts, addition of concomitant treatments 
(permitted or not), noncompliance with treatment, and other 
factors. While it is desirable in theory to conduct prospective 
studies of longer duration, so that important complications 
that take time can emerge, and the durability of efficacy 
can be directly observed, the feasibility of and the technical 
requirements for such studies have not yet been addressed. 
Finally, the inclusion of EERW studies in our meta-analysis 
allows a richer interpretation of “long-term” efficacy: the 
EERW design is utilized to assess the efficacy of treatment 
that has been administered for potentially lengthy periods 
of time prior to randomization. This design, also called the 
randomized discontinuation design, has been used in multiple 
therapeutic areas where it is important to determine whether 
patients responding to long-term open-label treatment are, in 
fact, responding to the pharmacological effects of the drug, or 
just the non-specific effects of treatment (such as the placebo 
response). Such studies have been performed for decades in 
oncology,43 depression,44 rheumatoid arthritis,45 cardiology,46 
schizophrenia,47 and numerous other indications.48 Therefore, 
the superiority after randomization of active treatment over 
placebo among patients who have already demonstrated 
a longstanding response to open-label medication can be 
interpreted as long-term efficacy that is not due to a placebo 
effect or other non-specific factors.
Many of these products have also undergone long-term 
open-label extension studies to provide information on the 
durability of treatment responses achieved during the ran-
domized controlled trials; we did not examine these studies 
in this review; however they generally demonstrate that PI 
reductions in patients studied in randomized controlled trials 
remain durable for extended periods.49–63
This meta-analysis has several limitations. First, it only 
included EERW studies, therefore only included results 
from patients who responded to opioids during the open-
label titration phase. The pros and cons of the EERW design 
are beyond the scope of this review, and have been amply 
reviewed elsewhere.41,64,65 To summarize, the advantages of 
the EERW study design are that it is accepted by the FDA for 
registration of drug treatments,41 can minimize the amount of 
time subjects receive ineffective or poorly tolerated treatment, 
may offer improved assay sensitivity, and yields open-label 
data that may be more relevant to clinical practice than only 
double-blind data. Another advantage of the EERW design 
is that the open-label titration phase of typical EERW studies 
mimics clinical practice with individual titration to optimized 
doses, an important design feature for medications with 
high inter-patient variability in optimal dose and a relatively 
narrow therapeutic index.41 Perceived disadvantages to the 
EERW design include questions about generalizability of 
both efficacy and AE data, challenges in comparing outcomes 
to standard prospective parallel treatment designs, and more 
complex interpretation.41,64,66 An additional limitation of note 
is that most of the studies included in the meta-analysis focus 
on CLBP
, which has been a frequently used model of chronic 
pain because of the prevalence of the condition, and hence, 
the practicality of conducting clinical trials.
Many of the manuscripts screened in the present analysis 
failed to report critical information. This necessitated request-
ing data from manuscript authors, a cumbersome and time-
consuming process. We recommend that journals continue 
to refine and require minimum quality standards for proper 
interpretation and ease of use in meta-analyses.65 Initiatives 
like CONSORT (http://www.consort-statement.org/) and the 
EQUATOR network (http://www.equator-network.org/) have 
been put in place to foster adequate reporting of randomized 
controlled trials.
Conclusion
This meta-analysis of FDA-required double-blind, random-
ized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of opioid analgesics 
for the treatment of chronic pain has shown that there is an 
ample evidence base supporting the efficacy of opioid analge-
sics for at least 3 months’ duration, a standard period for the 
evaluation of treatments for chronic pain and other chronic 
disorders. This evidence base is at least as large as that for 
any other class of analgesics, and analysis of  
responders

not focused on the risks of opioids, nor the risk–benefit 
balance, and hope that our review at least characterizes the 
evidence base for efficacy in order to inform these important 
broader discussions.
