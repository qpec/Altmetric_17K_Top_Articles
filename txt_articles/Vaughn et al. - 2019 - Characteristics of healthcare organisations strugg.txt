AbstrAct
Background Identifying characteristics associated 
with struggling healthcare organisations may help 
inform improvement. Thus, we systematically reviewed 
the literature to: (1) Identify organisational factors 
associated with struggling healthcare organisations 
and (2) Summarise these factors into actionable 
domains.
Methods Systematic review of qualitative studies 
that evaluated organisational characteristics of 
healthcare organisations that were struggling as 
defined by below-average patient outcomes (eg, 
mortality) or quality of care metrics (eg, Patient Safety 
Indicators). Searches were conducted in MEDLINE 
(via Ovid), EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and 
Web of Science from database inception through 
February 8 2018. Qualitative data were analysed using 
framework-based synthesis and summarised into key 
domains. Study quality was evaluated using the Critical 
Appraisal Skills Program tool.
Results Thirty studies (33 articles) from multiple 
countries and settings (eg, acute care, outpatient) with 
a diverse range of interviewees (eg, nurses, leadership, 
staff) were included in the final analysis. Five domains 
characterised struggling healthcare organisations: 
poor organisational culture (limited ownership, 
not collaborative, hierarchical, with disconnected 
leadership), inadequate infrastructure (limited quality 
improvement, staffing, information technology or 
resources), lack of a cohesive mission (mission conflicts 
with other missions, is externally motivated, poorly 
defined or promotes mediocrity), system shocks (ie, 
events such as leadership turnover, new electronic 
health record system or organisational scandals that 
detract from daily operations), and dysfunctional 
external relations with other hospitals, stakeholders, or 
governing bodies.
Conclusions Struggling healthcare organisations 
share characteristics that may affect their ability to 
provide optimal care. Understanding and identifying 
these characteristics may provide a first step to helping 
low performers address organisational challenges to 
improvement.

IntroductIon
The Institute of Medicine’s 2001 report 
addressing variation in quality of care1 
spurred strong interest by healthcare 
organisations and patients to improve 
quality.2 Today, US healthcare quality 
is publicly reported and linked to reim-
bursement, providing an impetus for 
improvement. Some healthcare organ-
isations, however, still have difficulty 
crossing the quality chasm.3 The poten-
tial causes of failing to attain quality 
targets 
are 
myriad. 
For 
example, 
resource availability, location and patient 
case-mix can affect performance.4–8 Yet, 
these factors only partially explain vari-
ation in quality.7
Studies 
of 
top-performing 
organ-
isations suggest they share common 
features, including a positive ‘organisa-
tional culture’ (ie, the norms, values and 
basic assumptions of an organisation) that 
embraces change.9–11 This flexibility may 
accelerate adoption of patient safety initia-
tives that improve care.12–16 In addition, 
high performing organisations often have 
robust patient safety programmes,15 16 led 
by committed individuals who support 
and respect employees.16 While much is 
known about success in high-performing 
organisations, little is known about why 
low performing organisations struggle. 
Addressing this gap can help organisa-
tions most in need identify and overcome 
barriers.
We thus conducted a systematic review 
of qualitative studies that evaluated 
healthcare organisations with below-av-
erage performance in patient outcomes 
or quality of care metrics. Taking advan-
tage of detailed, discovery-oriented data

Systematic review
contained in qualitative studies,17 we performed 
framework-based thematic synthesis18 19 to: (1) Iden-
tify organisational factors associated with struggling 
healthcare organisations and (2) Summarise these 
factors into actionable domains that may inform 
efforts to improve quality.
Methods
A research team composed of experts in imple-
mentation science, qualitative research methods, 
patient safety and systematic reviews was convened 
to determine project design and data throughout the 
study. We developed and registered a study protocol 
(PROSPERO: CRD42017067367, available at: http://

following 
the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses recommendations.20
We focused on qualitative studies—those that 
use open-ended techniques, such as interviews and 
non-statistical techniques for analysis17—for three 
reasons. First, qualitative data are useful to evaluate 
some concepts (such as culture) that can be difficult 
to measure quantitatively.21 Second, qualitative studies 
allow concepts to be evaluated in context (eg, how do 
the beliefs and experiences of front-line staff affect 
implementation?) adding depth to understanding. 
Finally, rather than having a priori hypotheses, inclu-
sion of qualitative studies allows for inductive gener-
ation of themes (summary concepts based on data) to 
identify novel aspects related to performance.17
We sought to specifically identify characteristics 
and barriers that may impede improvement efforts 
and/or result in poor patient outcomes at struggling 
healthcare organisations. Therefore, in contrast to 
studies of ‘positive deviants', we studied such ‘negative 
deviants’ to identify unique barriers that may not be 
present in average or high-performing organisations, 
thus informing efforts directly applicable to such 
organisations.22
Inclusion criteria
Qualitative studies were eligible for inclusion if they 
evaluated organisational or cultural characteristics in 
the context of struggling healthcare organisations. 
‘Healthcare organisations’ included ambulatory, suba-
cute, acute, emergency or intensive care settings in any 
private or public institution. We identified a facility 
as ‘struggling’ when below-average performance in 
patient outcomes (eg, mortality) or quality of care (eg, 
Patient Safety Indicators (PSI-90) Score) was reported. 
Studies that reported compliance with an intervention 
or financial performance without associated patient 
outcomes or quality of care were excluded. Three 
authors (VV
, JA, SW) independently determined eligi-
bility with disagreements resolved through consensus.
search strategy
Between November 2016 and February 2018, a 
medical librarian (WT) performed serial literature 
searches from database inception through February 
8 2018 in the following databases: MEDLINE (via 
Ovid), EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and 
Web of Science. Searches designed for each database 
included controlled vocabulary terms (Medical Subject 
Headings) when available, combined with keywords to 
represent concepts such as ‘low performer,’ ‘laggard’ 
(online supplementary appendix). Additional studies 
of interest were found through hand searches of bibli-
ographies and discussion with content experts.
data extraction
Data were extracted from included studies inde-
pendently and in duplicate by 3 authors (VV
, JA, SW) 
on a template adapted from the Cochrane Collabo-
ration.23 Data included definitions for performance, 
number and role of interviewees, method for sampling 
(eg, snowball), data collection (eg, interviews) and 
analysis, and main findings.
We specifically abstracted the following data for 
analysis: (1) Primary quotes from interviewees (eg, '‘I 
would like to see more collaboration…’-Director of 
Performance'),24 (2) Summary quotes (eg, ‘Participants 
also indicated an inadequate emphasis on learning',24 
and (3) Author interpretations of study data (eg, ‘The 
lack of congruence between … mission[s] created 
tension'.25 Author interpretations were collected 
primarily from the results section of manuscripts, 
however (consistent with other reviews),16 26 inter-
pretations from the discussion were abstracted when 
supported by data.26 When studies also included high 
performers, we abstracted data contrasting these 2 
categories.
creation of domains
Abstracted data were analysed using framework-based 
synthesis—a robust method of pragmatically combining 
themes from qualitative studies.18 19 This methodology 
involved a two-step process.18 19 27 First, a framework 
relevant to the study question was identified a priori. 
Given its comprehensiveness, widespread applicability 
and focus on systematically assessing organisational 
context, we chose the Consolidated Framework for 
Implementation Research (CFIR).9 CFIR spans 39 
constructs consolidated from implementation frame-
works to systematically assess contextual factors that 
influence practice and change efforts. Using CFIR 
constructs, we created a codebook for identifying 
organisational characteristics including CFIR domains 
such as ‘Outer Setting’ and ‘Process'.9 Given that 
many CFIR constructs are positive or focus on project 
implementation, not all domains were applicable (eg, 
‘innovation characteristics’) and we modified some 
domains to the negative (eg, ‘leadership engagement’ 
to ‘disconnected leadership’; online supplementary

Systematic review
table 1). Each manuscript underwent line by line 
coding independently and in duplicate by 3 authors. 
We paid particular attention to data that contradicted 
potential underlying assumptions (eg, struggling insti-
tutions with exemplary leadership) and report the 
frequency of supportive versus contradictory refer-
ences for domains.28 All coding was performed using 
QSR International's NVivo V
.11.
The second step of framework-based thematic 
synthesis involved iteratively updating, modifying, 
refining and creating codes and definitions to describe 
emerging concepts. We met weekly to compare inde-
pendently coded manuscripts for consistency to deter-
mine whether codes should be revised, removed or 
added. This approach encouraged generation of new 
ideas, while incorporating robust theory from prior 
research.26 27 29 For example, the code ‘hierarchical 
culture’ (defined by CFIR as ‘clear lines of authority 
over organisational processes’)9 remained consistent. 
Conversely, when ideas emerged that were not related 
to CFIR constructs, we created novel codes. For 
example, ‘major scandals’—a negative public relations 
event that detracted from daily operations—emerged 
inductively.
After aggregating codes into themes,305 overarching 
domains that distinguish struggling healthcare organ-
isations were identified. Some codes (eg, mergers) 
remained as stand-alone themes. Finally, we exam-
ined whether representation of domains varied by 
definition of ‘struggling.’ For this purpose, definitions 
included: (1) Overall performance metrics (any global 
hospital rating, eg, star rating), (2) Composite metrics 
(combined outcomes from at least two diseases, such as 
PSI-90), or (3) Disease-specific metrics (included either 
a single disease or outcome, such as central line-associ-
ation bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rates).
Quality assessment
Study risk of bias was assessed using the Critical 
Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklist,31 which 
is recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration for 
qualitative literature.32 The CASP tool consists of 
10 questions: 9 addressing quality and 1 addressing 
‘value’ (contribution to existing literature). For studies 
with multiple publications, risk of bias was assessed 
for the earliest. Three reviewers (VV
, JA, SW)  assessed 
each study independently and in duplicate with disa-
greements resolved through consensus. In accord-
ance with other qualitative reviews, studies were not 
excluded or stratified by risk of bias.16 26 33 Rather, we 
assessed relative contribution of low-quality and high-
quality studies in defining our domains.27
results
The search yielded 30 unique qualitative 
studies (33 arti-
cles) from various countries (figure 1).24 25 34–64 Studies 
included adult (12 studies)24 34 35 40 41 45 47 48 53 54 57 64 or 
paediatric (1 study)63 acute-care hospitals, emergency 
rooms (1 study),39 nursing homes (3 studies),25 52 60 
outpatient primary (7 studies)38 43 44 49 58 61 62 or specialty 
clinics (1 study),51 primary health systems (1 
study),37 accountable care organisations (1 study),36 
hospital units (2 studies),55 56 or residential treat-
ment programmes (1 study),59and a diverse range of 
study participants, including healthcare employees 
in administrative, clinical and leadership roles. Study 
sample sizes ranged from 17 to 194 and all but 1 
study50 had a high-performing comparator group. T
wo 
studies had a mid-performing comparison group.44 63 
Criteria for defining performance varied: 4 studies 
used overall performance metrics,36 46 50 61 12 used 
composite metrics25 35 37 41 43 52 53 55 57 and 14 used

domains characterising struggling healthcare 
organisations
Five domains (figure 2) consistently characterised 
struggling healthcare organisations, including: (1) 
Poor organisational culture, (2) Inadequate infra-
structure, (3) Lack of a cohesive mission and vision, 
(4) System shocks and (5) Dysfunctional external 
relations. Domain definitions, themes, frequency of 
reporting, contrary findings and representative quotes 
are reported in table 1.
Poor organisational culture
All 30 studies described poor organisational culture 
within struggling healthcare organisations (figure 2) 
that could be further classified into themes. The most 
frequent theme, limited involvement and ownership, 
was found in 27 studies.24 25 34–38 40–44 46 48–52 55–63 This 
included lack of established responsibility or conse-
quences (16 studies)24 25 34 36–38 41 46 48–50 52 55–57 61 and 
front-line employees who lacked a sense of ownership 
 
(4 studies)50 58 60 61 or self-efficacy (3 studies)24 34 48 60 
with many interviewees blaming patient factors for 
 
failure (9 studies).34 36 40 48 50 58–60 62 The second 
theme, 
a 
non-collaborative 
environment 
(21 
studies),4 24 25 35 36 38–40 42 44 48 50–53 55–57 61–63 manifested 
with employees who: did not feel connected to each 
other or their institution (8 studies),4 25 38 42 48 52 61 62 
operated in silos (7 studies),24 25 35 36 44 48 55 or suffered 
from low morale (6 studies).25 50–52 61 62 The third theme 
(17 studies)4 24 25 35–38 44 46 48 50 52 53 55 56 58 60 was hierar-
chical orientation (‘clear lines of authority of organisa-
tional processes').9 Hierarchy was often used to explain 
why middle managers and champions lacked empow-
erment (3 studies)46 50 60 and nurses and staff felt under-
valued (10 studies).4 24 25 36 38 44 48 50 52 53 55 56 58 Inter-
viewees noted that physician autonomy appeared to 
trump patient safety (3 studies)36 55 60 and approaches 
to problems were punitive (7 studies).4 24 25 35 50 55 60 
This type of negative hierarchy reportedly resulted 
in anxiety and fear (5 studies).4 25 37 48 50 The 
final theme involved disconnected leaders (16

Inadequate infrastructure

insufficient staffing or high turnover (18 studies),

emphasis placed on infrastructure in struggling sites, 
18 studies4 24 34 35 37 39–42 48 51 53 57 58 60–63 also reported 
inadequate infrastructure in high-performing organ-
isations (eg, ‘all sites lacked guidelines …and [had 
limited staffing] at night';39 ‘all sites… had inadequate 
computer facilities')42 or that infrastructure alone 
appeared insufficient to create high performance: 
‘The electronic record (EHR) was viewed as a useful 
tool…but efforts to rely on electronic documentation 
did not necessarily guarantee improvement'.40
lack of cohesive mission and vision
T
wenty-one of the 30 studies noted that struggling 
healthcare organisations lacked a cohesive mission 
or vision.24 25 35 36 38 40–43 48–50 52 53 55 56 58 60–63 Instead, 
struggling organisations perceived their mission 
as: (1) conflicting with other stated missions (12

isation’s mission demotivated staff, as noted in 1 study: 
‘financial gain did not (supply purpose), the implica-
tion for…leaders…is that the perception of economic 
viability as an end-all may be counterproductive'.25
system shocks
System 
shocks—or 
an 
organisation-wide 
event 
that detracts from day-to-day operations—repre-
sented an inductively derived domain from 12 
studies.24 25 36 38 41 42 46 48 50 53 60 62 Such shocks often 
occurred as the result of planned institutional change, 
such as when organisations implemented a new elec-
tronic health record (4 studies)36 38 50 62 or underwent 
restructuring (4 studies).36 46 50 62 However, shocks 
were also due to unplanned events, such as unantici-
pated leadership turnover (8 studies),24 25 41 46 50 53 60 62 
imminent financial failure (4 studies)38 42 48 50 or scan-
dals (1 study).50 When these events occurred, they 
overwhelmed the organisation’s energy and resources 
and became the dominating concern (eg, ‘We found 
that widespread concerns about finances…eclipsed 
attention paid to patient safety').64 Shocks often nega-
tively affected other domains (eg, ‘An explosive level 
of turnover made connectivity almost impossible';25 
‘Sporadic involvement of senior management was 
common…in part because of frequent turnover').24
Notably, some system shocks were transient, or 
a consequence of attempts to improve, as noted in 
accountable care organisations trying to improve cost 
and quality: ‘changes aimed at improving established 
organisations often caused an initial decrement in their 
performance as a result of the substantial reorganisa-
tions'.36 Regardless of the cause, the effects of system 
shocks were reported to linger: ‘(Struggling) organi-
sations (had) fragmented systems of accountability…a 
legacy of recent mergers'.46
dysfunctional external relations
Seven studies24 35–37 46 50 61 highlighted how dysfunc-
tional external relationships with other healthcare facil-
ities (5 studies),24 35–37 61 stakeholders (4 studies)37 46 50 61 
or governing bodies (2 studies)37 50 were associated 
with dire consequences. Notably, community and 
patient engagement by low-performing facilities was 
also limited (3 studies).37 46 61 Failure in this domain 
was prominent in facilities where financial perfor-
mance was dependent on external collaboration: ‘In 
one (accountable care organization)…local hospitals 
viewed the group as a threat and refused to cooperate 
in providing patient information'.36

domain prevalence by how performance was defined
Although many domains were applicable to all strug-
gling healthcare organisations, some differences were 
observed based on how performance was defined. For 
example, organisations struggling on a single disease 
(eg, CLABSI) noted difficulties with infrastructure—
particularly QI infrastructure (10/14 studies)—more 
than external relations (1/14 studies). Healthcare 
organisations struggling on composite metrics—such 
as postoperative complications—were more concerned 
about their mission (10/12 studies) than other organi-
sations (11/18 studies). For organisations struggling on 
overall performance (eg, star ratings), system shocks 
and dysfunctional external relationships were defining 
domains (3/4 and 4/4 studies, respectively; figure 2).
Quality assessment
Study quality was moderate–high with 6 studies 
scoring 9/1025 40 48 51 53 57 (online supplementary 
tables 2 and 3). Most studies were rated as ‘valuable’ 
(19 studies).24 25 35 38 41 46 49–51 53 55–63 Only 6 studies 
considered the relationship between researchers and 
participants (CASP question 6).4 25 40 42 61 63 Studies 
with higher quality (score ≥9) contributed more data 
(average 3 domains, 8 themes, 42 references) than 
lower-quality (score ≤6) studies (average 3 domains, 
7 themes, 21 references).
dIscussIon
In this systematic review of 30 international studies, 
we found 5 distinct domains typified struggling health-
care organisations: (1) Poor organisational culture, 
(2) Inadequate infrastructure, (3) Lack of a cohesive 
mission and vision, (4) System shocks and (5) Dysfunc-
tional external relations. Organisations often struggled 
in multiple domains simultaneously and nearly half of 
studies reported a recent system shock which appeared 
to worsen difficulties in other domains. While most 
domains had a clear, negative effect on organisations, 
infrastructure was not always linked to outcomes. 
Taken together, these domains represent a starting 
place to evaluate and diagnose low performance.
Many characteristics shared by struggling organ-
isations were counter to characteristics associated 
with high-performing organisations. For example, 
while disconnected leaders and non-collaborative 
environments were frequently found in struggling 
organisations, engaged leadership and a collabora-
tive organisational culture are associated with high 
performance.12–16 Furthermore, a ‘flat’ or team-based 
approach to problems is often associated with high 
performance,12–16 whereas we found hierarchical 
culture described in 17 studies of struggling organi-
sations. Employees at struggling organisations also 
described poor self-efficacy and often perseverated on 
patient factors (eg, ‘difficult patients’) as barriers that 
could not be overcome, rather than being motivated—
as high performers often are—to facilitate communi-
cation or provide additional resources to patients most 
in need. This view of patients as barriers was linked to 
a general sense that leadership at struggling organisa-
tions was motivated by penalties and finances, rather 
than by a patient-centred mission, which is associated 
with improved patient experience, physician satisfac-
tion and quality of care.66–68 Finally, struggling hospi-
tals had antagonistic external relationships and poor 
IT infrastructure, whereas positive external, commu-
nity and patient relationships, and well-integrated 
IT systems are associated with improved healthcare 
organisation performance.15 16 46 69
Not all themes readily contrasted with high 
performers. While most struggling hospitals reported 
poor infrastructure, this complaint was not unique to 
struggling organisations. Rather, employees believed 
they could benefit from additional staff and resources, 
regardless of performance or resource availability. 
Although it was not possible to assess differences in 
resource availability in low-performing versus high-per-
forming organisations, 3 studies noted that there were 
no significant differences in performance based on 
resources.34 60 61 Additionally, improving infrastruc-
ture in struggling hospitals did not appear to guarantee 
improved performance. One explanation offered 
was that efforts to improve infrastructure frequently 
diverted resources and disrupted existing care path-
ways, thus causing a decrement in performance (or 
leading to a system shock) for the short term.
‘System shocks’ was a domain unique to struggling 
organisations. Although not all change necessarily

causes disruption, being unprepared or unrealistic 
about the effort required can demotivate and anger 
staff.70 It is also possible that struggling organisations 
had underlying problems with disconnected leader-
ship or poor organisational culture that led staff to 
be less tolerant and responsive to change.11–16 These 
underlying factors may be further exacerbated when 
system shocks occur, overwhelming struggling organ-
isations and causing difficulties in other domains. As 
noted previously, many system shocks were caused 
by efforts to improve care in the long term and thus 
may not be completely avoidable. To prevent disas-
trous consequences, shocks must be anticipated 
and addressed. When shocks cannot be anticipated, 
leaders may directly address shocks to reduce negative 
consequences and potentially create positive change. 
Examples of using disruptive events as the impetus 
for culture change abound in business, with examples 
such as Delta Airlines, Ecolab and Novartis, who all 
used financial difficulties or scandals to improve their 
companies.71 Parallel possibilities in healthcare can be 
found in the dramatic organisational changes that may 
follow sentinel events.72 73
How may these domains inform efforts to improve 
quality of care? One approach may be to diagnose 
which domain(s) is the problem. This may be difficult 
for organisations, as measurement requires under-
standing employee perceptions and not all domains 
have validated measures. Furthermore, many of these 
domains are interlinked and may be hard to disen-
tangle.74 75 Although multiple tools exist for evaluating 
organisational or patient-safety culture (eg, Hospital 
Survey on Patient Safety Culture), use of differing 
instruments with varying validity make longitudinal 
assessments and comparisons between hospitals diffi-
cult.74 75 Given these difficulties, using the identified 
domains to facilitate conversation with front-line staff 
may be the first step.
After diagnosis, comes intervention. Although no 
easy fix exists for any domain, some studies may 
guide improvement. For example, a recent study of 
10 US hospitals demonstrated that a multimodal inter-
vention that involved creating ‘guiding coalitions’ 
(multidisciplinary intervention team) improved both 
organisational culture and outcomes.76 77 Similarly, to 
reduce CLABSI, empowering nurses to speak up when 
providers break sterility is important.78 Even within 
hierarchical cultures, empowerment can be improved 
by using checklists, ensuring supervisory support, and 
framing instances of nurses speaking up as patient 
safety issues rather than power or political ones.78 
For struggling organisations, these small changes 
may be both easier to perform and more sustainable, 
potentially leading to culture change over time.79 80 
To address concerns over organisational motivation, 
struggling facilities may have more success if they 
recognise that nurses may view the extra burden of 
improvement as financially motivated, and reframe 
in terms of benefit to patients.81 82 Struggling organ-
isations that are poorly networked could begin to 
improve relations by, for example, joining a quality 
collaborative—providing access to shared expertise 
and QI infrastructure and promoting positive culture 
change.65 83–85 Finally, to capitalise on the opportunity 
provided by a system shock, hospital leadership may 
prepare for change by centering on a salient mission 
to galvanise employees. For example, during and 
after mergers, leadership must unify to prevent an 
‘us vs them’ mentality that can destroy collaboration 
and morale.86 During financial difficulties, leadership 
must be transparent regarding budgeting decisions. 
For example, one hospital turned around their finan-
cial crisis through transparency, using town halls to 
discuss financial problems and brainstorm solutions. 
In response, senior physicians united and donated 
money to prevent staff lay-offs.87
Our study has strengths. It is among the first to 
summarise and codify organisation features that 
characterise struggling healthcare organisations. Use 
of framework-based thematic synthesis allowed us 
to apply a combination of inductive and deductive 
reasoning to generate novel domains that align with 
conceptual frameworks and identify ways to improve 
status quo. In addition, we synthesised our findings 
into 5 concrete, potentially measurable and modifi-
able domains, thus enabling organisations to identify 
barriers to inform future improvement. We followed 
a rigorous approach including an explicit, published 
protocol, a comprehensive literature search, and review 
and qualitative coding by three reviewers. Finally, we 
unearthed an important domain—system shocks—
and identify how it may create critical, system-wide 
barriers for improvement.
Our study also has limitations. First, qualitative 
studies by nature have a small sample size with limited 
number of individuals and scenarios. However, quali-
tative data provide greater depth and detail to under-
stand underlying issues in context—which was our 
goal. Second, to avoid making incorrect assumptions, 
we reported language used by interviewees even if 
inconsistent with organisational science literature. 
Third, as with all systematic reviews, we were only 
able to assess reported results and quotations. Fourth, 
the quality of included studies varied and method-
ological stuy details were often lacking, reducing 
our ability to evaluate quality. Finally, whether these 
domains 
cause—or 
result 
from—organisational 
struggle, cannot be determined from this work. Rather 
than infer causality, we focused on identifying char-
acteristics of struggling organisations that may reflect 
barriers to improvement.
Our study has important implications. First, our 
findings suggest that health systems preparing for 
large-scale organisational change should adequately 
prepare in order to prevent system shocks, which, 
counterintuitively, may impede change. Second, our

study underscores the importance of context, organ-
isational climate and related factors in determining 
hospital performance. Third, we continue to require 
validated methods of measuring and improving organ-
isational domains, such as those found in this study. In 
the interim, leaders should engage front-line staff to 
help identify and address problem domains.
Healthcare value and quality matter now more than 
ever. We found struggling healthcare organisations 
have unique characteristics that may hinder their ability 
to meet quality challenges. The domains delineated 
in this review provide a starting point for addressing 
performance. The next step is to design high-quality 
interventions that help struggling hospitals improve.
