Plain English summary
Patient or user involvement in health research is well-established but is often limited to advising on research
questions and design, leaving researchers to collect and analyse ‘data’ (which in this paper means written copies of
interviews with patients about their experiences). We were working with sets of interviews with 1) young people with
depression and 2) people with experiences of stroke. We were looking for key themes that it would be useful for the
NHS to know about, and we developed short films which healthcare staff can use to think about how to make care
more patient-centred. We wanted to see what user involvement in this analysis would bring, and how best to achieve
it practically.
After the researcher team had analysed the interviews, we ran two one-day workshops with people with relevant
experience as a patient/service user or carer. We gave them some brief training in how to analyse interviews and
how they might be used for improving the quality of care. Then we looked at extracts from the interviews, and discussed
whether people could see the same themes as the researcher.
People identified similar themes to the researcher, but also identified new details the researcher had missed.
However, they felt reading large amounts of text was not the best way to use their time and experience. Instead they
recommended that a better approach would be for a researcher to meet with a group of users at the start of analysis,
to discuss what to look out for.
Abstract
Background Patient or user involvement in health research is a well-established principle. However, involvement is
often limited to advising on research questions and design, leaving researchers to complete data collection
and analysis. Involvement in data analysis is one of the most challenging, least well-explored aspects of involvement.
Qualitative interview data forms high volumes of rich, complex material which can be daunting to work with.
Analysing narrative interviews with patients is central to a patient-centred quality improvement method called
experience-based co-design. The analysis identifies ‘touchpoints’ – key moments of healthcare experiences – and leads
to the production of a ‘trigger film’ to spark codesign discussions between patients and staff. We wanted to see what
user involvement in this analysis would bring, and how best to achieve it.

Methods As part of a wider secondary analysis study to create new trigger films, we re-analysed interview transcripts
on experiences of young people with depression and experiences of stroke. We then ran two workshops with people
with relevant lived experience, working with extracts from the same materials after brief training.
Results People involved in the workshops identified similar themes to the researcher, but also brought some
new insights. While they engaged easily with the materials selected, we under-estimated how much time it
would take people to work through these. Discussion and sharing experiences and perspectives were highly
valued in the first workshop. In the second workshop, we therefore started with group discussion, based on
people’s own experience, of what they thought the touchpoints would be, and later viewed a draft trigger film together
to see how it compared.
Conclusions Those involved felt that while analysing transcripts was possible in small quantities, it was not best use of
their time. We suggest that conversation, rather than data, is at the heart of user involvement in analysis. One way to
retain the value of lived experience in the analytic process, without over-burdening people with data, is to elicit user
reflections on their experience at the start of analysis, and use this as a guide to direct both researcher and service user
attention during the remainder of the process.

Background
User-centred narratives and quality improvement
Patient experience is defined as one of three compo-
nents of quality in healthcare, alongside patient safety
and clinical effectiveness. Improving people’s experience
of healthcare has been highlighted as a priority for suc-
cessive governments in the United Kingdom [1]. A num-
ber of specifically user-centred quality improvement
approaches drawing on patient experience data have
been developed, such as Experience-Based Co-Design
(EBCD) and Patient and Family Centred Care [2–4].
Despite a substantial amount of evidence about what
matters to people about their care, until recently organisa-
tional initiatives have commonly focused on collecting
more patient experience data (typically through surveys)
and measuring performance, rather than using it for quality
improvement [5]. This situation is gradually changing, but
clinical staff keen to use patient experience data for im-
provement may lack organisational support to do so.
They need expert help sifting through such data to
identify themes and priorities for action, and imple-
menting quality improvement [6, 7]. This may be par-
ticularly true of narrative data. As Martin et al. [8]
note, making sense of quantitative data is challenging
enough; working out how to turn the ‘untamed rich-
ness’ of ‘soft’ forms of intelligence such as narrative and
observational data into action for quality improvement
may be even more daunting.
Bringing service user partners into the analysis process
may be one way to help achieve this. We involved users
in a secondary data analysis project which aimed to de-
velop new resources to support EBCD.
Patient and public involvement and data analysis
Patient and public involvement (PPI) in health research is a
well-established principle, meaning research is conducted
with or by users, rather than to, for or about them. Service-
user-researchers, who collect and sometimes analyse re-
search data, are more common in some research fields than
others, notably mental health. However, more typically PPI
involvement has been limited to advising on research ques-
tions and research design, leaving professional researchers
to complete data collection and analysis. PPI in data ana-
lysis is perhaps one of the most challenging and least well
explored aspects of involvement. Analysing patient stories
may appear more intuitive and approachable than, say,
quantitative analysis such as logistic regression or mathem-
atical modelling. At the same time, both the volume of the
data generated and the need for the analyst to be alert to
theory as well as patterns in the data can be a hurdle.
There are comparatively few articles documenting the
process of and rationale for service user involvement in
data analysis. A systematic review [9] found many exam-
ples of lay people becoming involved in the conduct, de-
sign or dissemination of research, but it was less
common for them to be involved in execution or trans-
lation of the research. This echoes findings that ‘exam-
ples are few of participatory interpretation and analysis
of data’ [10]. There are however some interesting exam-
ples of service user involvement in the analytic process,
which focus both on the process of ‘doing qualitative
analysis’ with lay partners, but also offer insights into
the benefits and challenges. These challenges include
how much training is required and to what level of
detail; practical constraints and demands of reading
Locock et al. Research Involvement and Engagement             (2019) 5:1 
Page 2 of 11
 through long transcripts; how to recruit user partners
able to engage with the perspectives of the specific study
population; and how to deal with the emotional impact
of reading potentially difficult stories [11–13].
Whitmore [14] cautions against expecting lay partners
to write for an academic audience (which could be ‘unfair
and unrealistic’), and distinguishes this from involvement
in interpretation and illuminating the meaning of partici-
pants’ accounts. The knowledge and understanding that
lay partners bring to the table has been argued to offer
clear benefits, and to counter the interests, assumptions
and perspectives which researchers themselves bring to
analysis.
Jennings et al. [15] have recently reviewed different
approaches to ‘collaborative data analysis’ within mental
health and propose the following typology:
� Consultation (researchers conduct the analysis and
present it to PPI partners for comment)
� Development (PPI partners help develop an initial
coding framework then applied by the researchers)
� Application (researchers develop a coding
framework and then involve PPI partners in
applying this to a set of transcripts)
� Development and application (in which PPI co-
researchers are given extensive training in data
analysis, and are involved over time in both developing
and refining the coding framework and applying it to
all data, described as the ‘gold standard’ of collaborative
data analysis).
The authors note that while studies using ‘consult-
ation’ may appear to be the least democratic approach,
they also ‘tended to have people with lived experience in
their research team….[and] moved beyond the binary
categorisation of researchers as academic or service
users’ [15 p.4]. One example used ‘multiple coding’
, with
one clinical researcher, one psychologist and one service
user researcher each independently coding focus group
transcripts to identify outcomes for Cognitive Behav-
ioural Therapy for psychosis [16]. The results showed a
high degree or consensus between the analysts but also
new themes, and ‘points of fracture or non-consensus’
(p.e96) which had to be resolved, in some cases by
returning to individual research participants to clarify
what they had meant.
An example of the gold standard ‘development and
application’ approach is Cotterell [17]. To support his
study of the needs of service users with life limiting con-
ditions he held repeated interpretation and ‘theme gen-
eration’ sessions over the course of several months with
a user panel. The researcher’s initial seven themes were
revised to eight themes, only two of which (‘diagnosis’
and ‘relationships’) remained the same. Strikingly the
revised themes included more emotional categories than
the original set, including ‘fear’
, ‘anger/frustration’
, and
‘grief’. Garfield et al. [18] describe a lighter touch process
of involving lay partners in analysis of qualitative data, by
giving people a sub-set of transcripts and inviting them to
come up with their own themes after brief training. These
mapped closely onto the themes already identified in the
researcher-led analysis, providing useful confirmation, but
also identified one new theme. The final output of the re-
search was presented as a ‘synergy of perspectives’ that
were not easily visible or separated.
Best et al. [19] tested the Participatory Theme Elicit-
ation or PTE method, with a youth advisory panel of 8
members. The research team selected 40 focus group
data extracts, from a study of school-based physical
activity, that ‘could be easily understood and interpreted
as standalone statements’ (p.3). The young people in-
volved were invited to sort these into thematic piles.
These were then recorded and grouped by researchers,
and the output was then compared with the researchers’
thematic analysis. Echoing Garfield [18], the authors
found that ‘while PTE analysis was, for the most part,
consistent with the researcher-led analysis, young people
also identified new emerging thematic content’ (p.1).
They note that approaches to involving people in
analysis need to be accessible, and that some techniques
(such as Byrne et al’s [10] experimentation with the Voice-
Centred Relational or VCR Method) are too elaborate and
time-consuming in terms of training and analysis time.
Byrne et al. themselves identify that teenagers involved
in the VCR method - which involves repeated attentive
reading of transcripts and the development of an emer-
ging narrative -found it ‘difficult, tedious and time con-
suming’ p.74).
Some researchers who have involved users in analysis
have expressed concerns about lay partners potentially
putting too much emphasis onto their own experiences
rather than analysing what came out of the data [18].
Cotterell [17], however, records that his early concerns
about ‘the ability of the group to remain ‘objective’ and to
refrain from blurring interpretation of data with their own
personal experience and concerns’ proved unfounded. He
concludes that service users with similar concerns and
experiences as those who are the focus of the study can
bring a reflective lens to the process and a greater capacity
for the analysis to truly ‘unpack the taken for granted’.
One might add that researchers also bring their own
biases about what they see in the data and what they re-
gard as important.
Fisher [20] argues that involvement of lay partners in
analysis can uncover nuances which may not be obvious
to a researcher. Disabled user researchers drew his
attention to a single passage in one transcript which for
them gave an important sense of how users feel judged
Locock et al. Research Involvement and Engagement             (2019) 5:1 
Page 3 of 11
 and oppressed by benefit assessment panels, but to
which he might not otherwise have given much weight.
This demonstrated how insider sensitivity to the nuance
of language can bring a level of understanding to the
process that researchers may not attain, even after long
immersion within a community. Similarly, Gillard et al.
[21] suggest that service user involvement in data ana-
lysis added ‘expertise by experience’ to the process, and
had changed the conventions of ‘doing research’ to some
degree by the inclusion of challenging voices, as well as
adding a more nuanced set of themes that came from
their differing points of reference.
What is experience-based co-design (EBCD)?
EBCD is a participatory action research approach to
quality improvement based on active patient-staff part-
nership [2]. It has three phases: ‘discovery’
, ‘co-design’
,
and implementation.
The discovery phase, which would normally last around
6 months, involves interviews with staff; observations of a
particular care pathway; and video-recorded interviews
with local service users and family members about their
experiences of care. These interviews are analysed by a re-
searcher (who may be an academic or a healthcare profes-
sional) to identify ‘touchpoints’ – these are key moments
of interaction between person and service where some-
thing could have been done better, or which exemplify
good experience. Video clips showing these touchpoints
are selected and edited into a ‘trigger film’. Examples of
touchpoints might include an account of insensitive com-
munication; a memorable act of kindness or emotional
care; disturbance from noise or lighting on the ward; par-
ticular efforts to ensure privacy and dignity.
In the co-design phase, the trigger film is shown first
to a workshop for users and family members only, and
then again to a joint workshop with healthcare staff. The
aim of the film is to trigger discussion about local quality
issues and agree a set of improvement priorities, which
are then addressed through small co-design working
groups (involving users and staff as equal partners). The
whole EBCD process typically takes 12–18 months to
complete [22].
Although evaluations have shown EBCD to be effect-
ive, they have also identified the time and resources it
takes as barriers to widespread adoption [22]. In a previ-
ous study [23]we therefore tested an ‘accelerated’ version
of EBCD in two lung cancer services and two intensive
care units, in which we replaced much of the discovery
phase with interviews from existing national interview
collections, held by the Health Experiences Research
Group, University of Oxford [2] and disseminated on
the Healthtalk.org website through a series of lay-
friendly ‘topic summaries’. Thus instead of trigger films
made from local user interviews, we identified touchpoints
from existing interviews which had been collected around
the country, and made films which can be used in multiple
locations. However, in common with other EBCD pro-
jects, this did not include direct user involvement in
analysis.
Rationale for the new project
Having demonstrated that trigger films developed from
the national archive could have a similar effect to local
films, and were ‘good enough’ to trigger co-design, we
were prompted to reflect whether further adaptations to
the discovery phase were possible. The co-authors were
awarded a grant for secondary data analysis from the
Economic and Social Research Council (ES/L01338X/1)
to make a series of new trigger films and pursue two
possible ways to streamline the discovery phase:
1. What would be lost, if anything, if touchpoints for
the trigger films were selected only from material
already chosen for dissemination on Healthtalk,
rather than re-analysing full transcripts, as a way of
further accelerating the process (i.e. from the topic
summaries on the website)?
2. How could service users themselves best get
involved in data analysis? Would they identify
similar or different touchpoints to the researcher?
In this paper we focus particularly on this second area,
and describe the work we undertook with user partners
in analysis workshops. We conclude with recommenda-
tions developed with our workshop attendees for taking
the process forward and our reflections on it.
As well as having a service user co-investigator on the
team [GS], we organised two workshops to explore in-
volvement in data analysis, with two service user panels;
one panel member has also co-authored this paper [LB].
Methods
Initial researcher-led analysis
Secondary analysis [24] was undertaken on two existing
HERG interview collections: ‘Experiences of stroke’
, and
‘Experiences of young people with depression’. These
topics were among several selected for re-analysis in
consultation with our research partner at NHS England
(NC) as national priorities. We focused on these two
topics for user involvement because they offered diver-
sity in terms of both the age groups affected and a mix
of mental and physical conditions. Re-analysis of both
the original transcripts for each study (n = approxi-
mately 40 for each study), and the summarised topic
sections on the healthtalk website, was first undertaken
by a researcher [SK]. This focused on identifying
‘touchpoints’ of care (described above), coding for nar-
rative extracts that demonstrated ways in which service

 experiences impacted either positively or negatively on
people’s overall experience of care, using a framework
analysis [25, 26].
User analysis workshops
We then sought to sense-check the analytic themes identi-
fied by the researcher in two workshop sessions with users.
The aim of the workshops was to help us understand more
fully to what extent service users might become involved in
the development of trigger films and to consider how this
might bring new insights to the process of data analysis for
trigger film development. We also anticipated that the
workshops would help us to think more broadly about the
practical feasibility of involvement at this level, gaining
feedback from those involved on how they felt about taking
part in such activities, and whether they might suggest
other ways of working.
Researchers SK AND LL approached groups and orga-
nisations associated with people with lived experience of
both health conditions (young people with depression,
and stroke), using a flyer and poster. People interested
were provided with details of how to contact the team
and discuss any questions before deciding whether they
would like to be involved. Arrangements for each work-
shop were made to fit with the needs of each group,
involving a short day (approximately 10 am to 3 pm) of
activities associated with qualitative data analysis, includ-
ing refreshments, lunch and social time. Everyone was
paid for their time and travelling expenses.
At the end of both workshops, we asked people for any
verbal feedback on the process of being involved which
could help us improve the process in future, and some
people also sent us further feedback by email afterwards.
The format originally for the workshops included a
brief training introduction to qualitative analytical
methods; an explanation of EBCD, trigger films and
the concept of touchpoint;, followed by participants
reading interview transcript extracts and website sum-
maries to identify touchpoints. Workshops were facili-
tated by the Principal Invesitgator (LL) and lead
researcher (SK), with support from a research assistant.
Each is described below.
Workshop one; young people’s experiences of mental
health services
This workshop aimed to work on the development of a
trigger film on young people’s experiences of mental
health services. Six young people (ages 19–23) agreed to
be involved. Four were identified from the INVOLVE
young people’s mental health advisory panel; one had
been a research participant in a previous healthtalk
project about antidepressant use; and one had experi-
ence of a previous EBCD project on a different health
topic. The workshop was also attended by our service
user co-applicant who provided the group with insights
from his own experiences of working with EBCD projects,
and co-author GR. Workshops were not recorded but SK
and LL were present throughout and the research assist-
ant took notes Table 1.
Workshop 2 – Experience of stroke, or caring for
someone who had had a stroke
This second workshop aimed to work with service
users on the development of a trigger film about expe-
riences of stroke. For this workshop, users were identi-
fied through a regional PPI involvement network, using
a poster and flyer advertising the workshop. The poster
was also displayed on community notice boards in sev-
eral locations. Four people who had experienced a
stroke, and one person caring for a relative who had a
stroke agreed to get involved. They were all over 50
years of age. The note-taker assistant was also available
to help workshop attendees navigate through the paper-
work. This was important to ensure that people with
impairments resulting from their stroke could feel com-
fortable taking part. As previously SK and LL were also
present throughout. The structure of the session was
adapted from that of workshop 1, taking account of the
learning we had gained from that session (see ‘Results’
below), as well as to accommodate specific needs of the
client group Table 2.
For this workshop SK and LL provided similar but
shorter presentations to the group about qualitative re-
search, healthtalk and EBCD. Next, instead of analysing
interview transcripts, the group were asked to identify
what they thought of as key touchpoints for stroke care,
based on their own experiences. We then asked them to
review a website ‘topic summary’ on stroke experiences,
again looking for touchpoints. Towards the end of the
session we asked the group to watch a draft half-hour
film that had been pre-prepared by SK after completing
her independent analysis. We asked them to consider

 how well it encapsulated the touchpoints they had iden-
tified earlier in the day.
Results
Workshop 1 – Young people and depression
Our reflections on workshop 1 were that both the inform-
ative sessions in the morning and the subsequent analysis
work in the afternoon took far longer than we had antici-
pated. Having prepared four transcript extracts and five
topic summaries, we only managed to go through one tran-
script extract fully (working independently first and then
comparing page by page as a group) and most of a topic
summary (explored collectively page by page). However,
given that this was a workshop designed specifically to ex-
plore the feasibility of these activities, it provided us with
interesting insights into aspects of the process including
whether or not the tasks appeal, or are practical to engage
with, for people with differing interests and capabilities.
Analysing transcripts for quality improvement pur-
poses involves reading through a lot of material that
may not be relevant in order to identify touchpoints as
well as deciding in each case whether a particular pas-
sage could be viewed as a touchpoint, and if so, why. In
the group, a lot of time was spent reflecting on this, for
each of the extracts that were identified. Some feedback
suggested it was difficult to interpret a touchpoint
because of this way they are interwoven with other
aspects of the person’s narrative, making selecting and
focusing a very difficult task. For example, a brief com-
ment about access to services may be embedded within
a longer narrative of early symptoms and inner feelings.
Maybe researchers are so used to analysis, abstraction,
summarising, and illustrating that we underestimate
how complex this might be for others, despite the ad-
vantage of lived experience they bring.
The group were very focused on the importance of early
intervention for depression. This was something SK had
identified from her own analysis of the transcripts, and
was therefore not an entirely new theme. However, the
group’s input was powerful in terms of the emphasis and
insight that came from their own lived experience, which
in turn reinforced the importance of this aspect of service
provision for the research team. This then influenced the
selection of touchpoints on this topic for the trigger film.
Engaging with the material (both transcripts and sum-
maries from the website) stimulated interesting discus-
sions amongst the group about their own experiences, one
key reason why we got through less material than origin-
ally planned. Although at first we viewed this as a failure
on our part to ‘keep things on task’
, it became clear that
the value was in this very aspect – in giving space for the
young people to discuss how their own experiences com-
pared with the interview data. The impulse to discuss each
touchpoint in detail also provided some personal benefit
of sharing stories and mutual support – which one young
person identified in her feedback as one of the main
attractions of doing involvement activities.
Feedback suggested that although initially the idea of
a touchpoint was difficult to grasp, it became clearer as
they applied it to sections of text and agreeing exam-
ples. Group discussion and working in pairs helped
shed more light than solo-working on what to look for
and how to read the transcript in different ways. Facili-
tated discussion helped the young people refine and
clarify their ideas, and gain confidence in sharing their
own opinions and experiences. It also felt more enjoy-
able and less like an ‘exam scenario’
, as one young
person put it. There was general agreement that the re-
search team’s expectations of how much material we
might get through was unrealistic, and that we needed
to reduce the volume considerably for any future ana-
lysis workshops.
Some of the group of young people were keen to get in-
volved in further work. One (co-author LB) wanted to take
on extra analysis to do later at home, and eventually de-
cided to follow a career in research (see Table 3). Another
Table 3 Co-author LB reflections on workshop 1
I felt very engaged in the workshop and was keen to get involved and
help develop the EBCD quality improvement process. It was empowering
to use my own experiences, which at times had been bad, for something
positive.
The workshop started with an introduction to qualitative research and
touchpoints. As a group we worked through the first few examples, and
I felt able to identify touchpoints. After working through some of the
transcripts independently, we compared what we had found and there
were a lot of similarities. During the workshop, I identified a series of
touchpoints which resonated with my own experience. As a group, we
discussed these parallels, and I found this therapeutic.
I enjoyed coding the transcripts and at the end of workshop asked if I
could have more to continue working through at home. The workshop,
and working with the research team, led me to a change in direction.
After this introduction to qualitative research, I decided this was something I
was really passionate about, and I wanted to work in this field. I am now
doing a PhD exploring PPI in the development of core outcome sets.

 young person who had not been able to attend the work-
shop also worked on some transcript material at home.
Of course not everyone who gets involved in research
as a user will end up training as a researcher, but this ac-
count resonates with a wider literature on the personal
benefits of involvement, for example Thompson et al’s
[27] suggestion that it might ‘offer spaces for the recon-
figuration of identity’ (p.47).
Workshop 2 – Stroke
Based on our experience of Workshop 1, the length
and detail of the introductory sessions on qualitative
analysis and experience-based co-design were consider-
ably shortened for Workshop 2. In addition, rather than
starting the analysis work going through transcript ex-
tracts, we invited the group to discuss together what
they thought might be likely touchpoints for stroke
case, based on personal experiences. This generated a
rich discussion and a list of candidate touchpoints. Ex-
amples included:
� Professionalism/caring attitude from staff -
nursing, but also e.g. x-ray staff
� Staff being respectful regardless of patient
attitude – emotions and difficult feelings can
manifest in different ways, but some patients
are difficult
and demanding
� Being given strategies for coping. Knowing
what helps and being able to explain it to
others – communication
� Importance of information and explanations –
patients may need repeated explanations due
to cognitive impairments as well as emotional
problems
� Noise, light, alarms going off
� Importance of being offered physiotherapy, what
happens when it is not available
� Lack of long term support after discharge
� Unsettling to be in ward with dementia
patients
� Delays in referral for rehabilitation
appointments
� Long waiting times
� Need more information about what to
expect and how to deal with things e.g.
personality changes, emotions, sensory
overload
We then asked them to review a website ‘topic sum-
mary’ on stroke experiences, again looking for touch-
points. We found their assessment produced very similar
results to the researcher perspective, though given varying
degrees of fatigue as well as visual and cognitive impair-
ment some found dealing with written material less easy
or engaging than the verbal touchpoint discussion.
Towards the end of the session we asked the group to
watch a draft half-hour film that had been pre-prepared
by the researcher after completing an independent ana-
lysis. This had been based around the following themes:

Final thoughts
Listen to the patient as a person
Overall, the group felt the film reflected well the themes
relating to stroke services that they had brought up, but
with some differences in both content and emphasis; for
example, noise and light disturbance, sensory overload
and disturbance from other patients were themes they
identified which did not feature in the draft film. As well
as the content of the film, the group commented that it
was important for clips to be audible and succinct; they
would have preferred a shorter film.
We invited feedback about the workshop process.
Despite efforts to reduce the amount of information-
giving about the analysis process in response to feedback
from the first workshop, they felt that there had still
been too much to get through in the early informative
sessions so that after lunch they were starting to feel
tired. Some also felt that the information had been too
Locock et al. Research Involvement and Engagement             (2019) 5:1 
Page 7 of 11
 dense to engage with. One suggestion they gave to
simplify the process was perhaps to ask people to come
to the session with a short list of things that mattered to
them the most about stroke care, and/or potentially
sending out materials to them to work on at home, at a
pace and time that they could control.
However, there was general support for the value of a
group discussion to pool ideas about touchpoints as an
accessible way to contribute. There was consensus that
this made better and more efficient use of their time and
knowledge than text-based work, and could be a way
forward for collaborative analysis.
Everyone involved said they had enjoyed the day and
that it felt good to be involved in something with the
potential to make a difference. Two expressed a sense of
frustration at no longer being able to work due to their
strokes, and that taking part in this type of activity helped
them to feel a sense of self-worth and being valued.
The trigger films they worked on, along with others
produced by researcher-only secondary analysis, are now
publicly available at http://www.healthtalk.org/peoples-

improvement/topics.
Discussion and Recommendations
Working with service users to help think about how best
they might become involved with devising trigger films
using the HERG interview collection was a learning process
for both us and our user partners. As other research teams
before us have found, user involvement in data analysis
poses a number of practical issues. In summary, the two
groups of service users who worked with us reported that
they found the process interesting and engaging, and they
came to understand what to look for in the data, although
it took some longer than others to reach that point and
some found the process tiring and difficult to engage with.
They identified very similar themes and touchpoints to
those that the researcher had selected in the data
samples they worked with, but also through general
discussion of their own experiences. Some additional
themes or differences in emphasis were identified.
The nature of the analytic task in this case (identifying
topics relevant for quality improvement, from existing
interview collections) was fairly practical and applied,
and did not require specific expertise in sociological
theory or analysis. We felt some understanding of the
process of data collection and analysis would be helpful, as
well as explaining EBCD and the concept of ‘touchpoints’.
However, despite our efforts to reduce the amount of
training in qualitative research methods between the first
and second workshops, we still did not get this right. In
future we would focus less on general qualitative analysis
methods. Our impulse was to think that methods training
was essential to reduce the power differential between
researchers and PPI partners, and equip them to deal with
large amounts of text. Yet training is only empowering if it
is targeted and useful; we were not clear enough about
what was needed and why. With hindsight, training people
to be more like researchers and process lots of text was
probably misplaced, in this case.
In working with transcripts, we came to realise that
even the small sample of data we had hoped to get
through was too ambitious in the time available. In the
wider secondary analysis study, we found that for the
purposes of identifying touchpoints for a trigger film,
working with summarised findings on healthtalk was
‘good enough’ and even we as researchers did not really
need to go back to full transcripts. Thus working only
with these summarised findings might have been a
better option in our PPI workshops.
Given that even experienced qualitative researchers
can feel overwhelmed and puzzled by how to make
sense of mounds of data in what is often a lengthy and
immersive process of analysis, we should not expect
service users to feel any less daunted. People with cognitive
impairment or fatigue related to their condition can find
concentrating for long periods especially challenging, as
reported by those who had had a stroke. Even without
health difficulties, some people understandably just find
reading large amounts of material difficult, boring or hard
to get to grips with, as some young people in this project
reported. Equally, reading repeated accounts of other
people’s experiences can be tiring or upsetting, although in
this project no-one reported being distressed.
Conversely, there can be benefits for people, for example
providing an opportunity for them to ‘give something back’
and contribute to improving services. It can also offer a
space to meet people and discuss their own experiences
with others in a supportive environment [27], although this
in itself needs to be carefully managed. Our service user
co-author (GS) who had been involved in a previous EBCD
project recalled that in that project some people found
recalling their experiences upsetting (though they had been
well supported by a clinical nurse specialist and chose to
continue being involved). However, he felt that the work-
shops for the current project seemed to offer a secure and
supportive environment, where sharing lived experience felt
positive and purposive rather than exposing.
Co-author LB, who went on after the project to be
awarded a PhD studentship for a qualitative study of
PPI, demonstrates that some users can get deeply
involved, but her experience and level of interest are
probably atypical. It would not be appropriate for
involvement in analysis to be confined only to those
willing to pursue such an interest to this level.
However, it does indicate wider benefits of PPI in
building capacity for individuals and the NHS.

 One reason why data analysis took even longer than
we anticipated was because reading transcript material
often prompted users to compare and contrast this
with their own experiences, and to generate lengthy
discussion with the researchers and other service users
at the workshop. This has sometimes been identified as
a ‘problem’ with PPI, as in some way a deflection from
the task in hand. But as other researchers have found,
analysis by people with lived experience can bring new
insights that might be missed by analysts with more
professional concerns, and it is important to allow space
for these reflective conversations, rather than artificially
steer people back to a pre-set agenda.
From discussion with the people who got involved in
this work, we have come to the view that conversation
rather than data is at the heart of user involvement in
analysis. We suggest that one way to retain the value of
lived experience in the analytic process, without over-
burdening people with training, time and ‘mounds’ of
data, is to elicit user reflections at the start of analysis,
and use this as a guide to direct the researcher’s gaze. In
this
we
are
drawing
on
Blumer’s
notion
of
the
‘sensitising concept’ to ‘suggest directions along which to
look’
[28].
Later
in
the
process
of
trigger
film
development, key themes from the data analysis can
then be presented for feedback and validation, to check
whether the themes adequately reflect those identified
by users at the outset, whether anything is missing and
whether changes in emphasis are required. This sits
more within the ‘development’ approach identified by
Jennings et al. [15] than ‘development and application’
,
though in our case having a lay co-investigator [GS] and a
co-researcher
keen
on
‘application’
who
became
a
co-author [LB] somewhat blurs this distinction.
The Jennings et al. best practice framework [15] was
not available to us when working on this project, but is
designed to support collaborative data analysis in a wide
range of qualitative study types. They note particularly
that applying the ‘gold standard’ or ‘development and
application’ is often not feasible in time and resource-
limited studies. Instead they propose that the research
team
(which
should
include
people
with
lived
experience)
should
develop
a
preliminary
coding
framework, share it with a PPI co-researcher group
through a workshop to coproduce a refined coding frame-
work, which the research team then apply to the data and
reflect on the results with the PPI co-researcher group.
What we have conceptualised as an analytic conversation
early in the analysis phase bears remarkable similarity to
this framework.
We conclude that the contribution of lay partners in
the analysis of data can add a valuable layer to the
process, ensuring the priorities of service users are
firmly at the forefront of the analysis. Whilst we found
much in common between the researcher-led analysis
and the themes users felt were important, young people
drew our attention to the importance they attach to
early intervention, and people with stroke identified
some aspects of their inpatient experience such as noise
and light disturbance, sensory overload and disturbance
from other patients. Our own reflections on the process
led us to consider widening the definition of ‘analysis’
in this context, to include early conversation and guid-
ance on the expected and eventual content of the ana-
lysis, thus firmly directing the researcher gaze to
prioritise service user lived experience. Just as there has
been a shift to involve people before any research is
done in setting research questions and priorities, so in-
volvement in analysis can equally be at an earlier stage.
Even if – as we found – comparisons between what re-
searchers and users see in the data are often more
about nuance and emphasis than major differences,
these nuances are important.
Madden and Speed [29] argue against a ‘narrow,
technocratic co-option of PPI’; instead, involvement
should be about.
‘populations engaging in the decisions that impact
their lives, identifying opportunities and strategies for
action. Being “critically involved” requires
acknowledging processes of situated contestation
rather than epistemic authority, identifying varieties of
publics and the contingency and complexity of the
construction of evidence’ (p.5).
As researchers, we discovered we were too attached to
our own process, our own concern with methods, and to
the idea that analysis inevitably means close immersion
in large amounts of text. But users told us this was not
realistic, nor was it best use of their time and insights;
they preferred conversational engagement in the analytic
process. They saw it as their role to guide us – in effect
to equip us with a map and a compass - but not to try
to become qualitative analysts labouring over multiple
transcripts.
Thus user involvement in analysis as it has evolved for
us can be a more creative, more discursive, less process-
driven approach, breaking out of researcher norms of
both what constitutes analysis and who can do it. This
resonates with previous findings that one of the ways in
which user partners can redress the power balance and
create a more equal conversation with researchers is
through
exercising
a
form
of
symbolic
capital
as
‘challenging
outsider’
,
maintaining
a
distinctive
non-researcher perspective [30].
Finally we note Staley et al’s [31] suggestion that the
impact of involvement should not be conceptualised
narrowly as changes to specific tasks or steps in a single
Locock et al. Research Involvement and Engagement             (2019) 5:1 
Page 9 of 11
 research project, but rather as a more diffuse ‘learning
experience’. They argue for a shift of emphasis from how
involvement changes research towards how it changes
researchers themselves, and their ‘values, preferences and
practice’ (p.6). The analytic conversation may change the
way we think, not just about a specific transcript or
project, but about how we approach the analysis process
more generally in the future.

Ethics approval and consent to participate
The original interviews included in the secondary analysis were given
approval by Berkshire Research Ethics Committee (09/H0505/66). Patients
consented to be interviewed, and for their interviews to be a) disseminated
online on Healthtalk and b) to be used additionally for secondary analysis,
teaching and service improvement. This paper reports a patient and public
involvement project, exploring involvement in qualitative data analysis and
commenting on data already collected in the above interviews. University of
Oxford institutional ethics guidance states that people who are “giving their
views on research….do not count as “human participants” in the sense
intended by CUREC’s [Central University Research Ethics Committee]
policy. They are not giving you information about themselves, and the
opinions they offer are not themselves the subject of research. You need not get
ethical approval of your research if your contact with people is confined to this
sort of interaction”.https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/governance/ethics/faqs-
