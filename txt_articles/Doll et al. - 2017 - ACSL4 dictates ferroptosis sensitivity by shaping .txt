Abstract
Ferroptosis is a form of regulated necrotic cell death controlled by glutathione peroxidase 4 
(GPX4). At present, mechanisms that could predict sensitivity and/or resistance and that may be 
exploited to modulate this form of cell death are needed. We applied two independent approaches, 
a genome-wide CRISPR-based genetic screen and microarray analysis of ferroptosis-resistant cell

 lines to uncover acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (Acsl4) as an essential 
component for ferroptosis execution. Specifically, Gpx4/Acsl4 double knockout cells presented an 
unprecedented resistance to ferroptosis. Mechanistically, Acsl4 enriches cellular membranes with 
long polyunsaturated ω6 fatty acids. Moreover, Acsl4 is preferentially expressed in a panel of

INTRODUCTION
Regulated necrotic cell death modalities are emerging as important players in 
(patho)physiological conditions1 Among these alternative forms of cell death particular 
attention has been paid to ferroptosis, a recently described form of regulated necrotic cell 
death implicated in tumor suppression, antiviral immunity, neurodegeneration and ischemia/
reperfusion injury (IRI)2–6. Initially, ferroptosis was found to be induced by a set of small 
molecules identified in a screen for compounds able to selectively induce cell death in 
isogenic tumors carrying a mutated form of RAS7. Ferroptosis is distinct from other forms 
of cell death based on morphological, biochemical and genetic traits. An initial description 
of its molecular players has revealed that the small molecule erastin (ERA) induces 
ferroptosis via inhibition of system XC− 8. System XC− is the cystine/glutamate antiporter 
known to be essential for cells in culture by providing adequate levels of cystine (i.e. the 
oxidized form of cysteine) as an essential precursor for the synthesis of the tri-peptide 
glutathione (GSH)9. Recently, the requirement of GSH in inhibiting ferroptosis was 
demonstrated to be related to its specific requirement for proper functioning of glutathione 
peroxidase 4 (GPX4)4, a unique enzyme that prevents detrimental phospholipid oxidation10. 
In the study by Yang and colleagues, the first GPX4 inhibitor (1S, 3R)-RSL-3 (RSL3) was 
described4.
Studies on the induction of ferroptosis have provided evidence that some cell types are in 
fact refractory to this form of cell death11. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to identify 
and to understand the molecular mechanisms contributing to this resistance because this 
knowledge will prompt us to predict the therapeutic value of inducing ferroptosis as well as 
provide novel possibilities for prevention of this form of cell death in pathologically relevant 
scenarios such as I/R-induced tissue damage. Despite intense investigations on the molecular

 players involved in ferroptosis, only a few modulators have been implicated so far. 
Moreover, their relevance in these conditions appears to be drug- or cell type-specific, thus 
precluding their use as strong predictors of sensitivity in order to exploit them in the context 
of cytoprotective therapies8, 12–14.
Accounting for this still limited understanding of which factors determine ferroptosis 
resistance, we sought to identify factors that could be used first as markers of sensitivity, and 
second put forward as novel targets for cytoprotective strategies. Using two distinct 
independent approaches, we (i) generated cell lines resistant to ferroptosis and (ii) performed 
a genome-wide recessive genetic screen with a lentiviral CRISPR-guide RNA library. Both 
approaches independently identified acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 
(Acsl4) as a critical determinant of ferroptosis sensitivity. We now show that ferroptosis is 
specifically linked to Acsl4 and not to other Acsl family members. Lipidomic analysis 
demonstrates how Acsl4 shapes the lipid “make-up” required for ferroptosis execution. 
Intriguingly, Acsl4 also emerges to predict sensitivity in a subset of basal-like breast cancer 
cell lines as shown herein. Finally, we provide proof of concept that the pharmacological 
inhibition of Acsl4 holds great potential as a promising cytoprotective strategy aiming to 
preserve tissue homeostasis in an in vivo relevant ferroptotic setting.
RESULTS
Acsl4 is an essential pro-ferroptotic gene
In order to identify genes that are essential for ferroptosis induction, two approaches were 
employed. First, we generated cell lines intrinsically resistant to ferroptosis. Cell lines used 
for this study were previously described elsewhere15, where we demonstrated that these cells 
specifically undergo ferroptosis upon Gpx4 inactivation2. Importantly, no alternative cell 
death pathway is triggered when cells are treated with RSL32. The general approach to 
obtain the resistant cell lines is outlined in Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1a. 
Specifically, mouse embryonic fibroblasts carrying two floxed alleles for the ferroptosis 
regulator Gpx4 and stably expressing 4-hydroxytamoxifen (TAM)-inducible Cre 
recombinase (in the following referred to as Pfa1 cells15) were treated with a lethal 
concentration (100 nM) RSL3 (Supplementary Fig. 1b) for approximately 10 days. Single 
clones were then isolated and their specific resistance to ferroptosis was re-tested by genetic 
deletion of Gpx4 (Fig. 1a), thus excluding unspecific side effects due to potential drug 
resistance mechanisms. Subsequently, three resistant clones were selected and expression 
analysis was performed using Illumina chips. Fig. 1b depicts the most down-regulated genes. 
The full list of up- and down-regulated genes is provided in supplementary information 
(Supplementary Table 1).
In parallel, we utilized a CRISPR/Cas9 screen in stably Cas9-expressing Pfa1 cells (Pfa1-
CAS9) (Supplementary Fig. 1c). These cells were then transfected with a gRNA library 
covering the entire mouse genome (Supplementary Fig. 1d)16. We showed that Cas9 
expression does not impact on ferroptosis sensitivity as this cell line efficiently underwent 
ferroptotic cell death induced by ERA, the Gpx4 inhibitor RSL3 and upon genetic Gpx4 
deletion (Supplementary Fig. 1e,f). Prior to lentivirus-mediated transduction into the Pfa1-
CAS9 cell line, the quality of the library per se was assessed by deep sequencing on an Ion

 torrent P1 chip, showing that 99.71 % gRNAs were found to be present in the lentiviral 
preparation (Supplementary Fig. 1g). Using this library, we conducted two recessive screens 
to identify genes that modulate susceptibility to ferroptosis induced by RSL3 and ERA. It 
was surprising that in both screens gRNAs targeting Acsl4 were represented by 66.38% and 
36.95 % of the total sequenced guides in the RSL3- and ERA-selected cells, respectively 
(Fig. 1c). The list of other gRNAs identified in the screen is deposited in Supplementary 
Table 2. Therefore, both approaches remarkably pointed to Acsl4, thus supporting an 
essential role in ferroptosis execution.
Next, we validated these findings by generating an Acsl4 knockout (KO) cell line using an 
independent gRNA. To this end, Pfa1 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid expressing a 
gRNA targeting exon 1 of the Acsl4 gene and a plasmid encoding Cas9 with a nuclear 
localization signal. After transfection, cells were seeded at low cell densities and individual 
clones were allowed to grow. Individual clones were isolated, expanded and then retested for 
their sensitivity to RSL3. All clones resistant to RSL3 showed mutations in exon 1 of Acsl4, 
which corresponded to truncated versions of the protein as determined by immunoblotting 
against Acsl4 (Supplementary Fig. 1h,i). Tracking of insertions and deletions in the targeted 
Acsl4 locus of single cell clones using the tool TIDE: Tracking of Indels by DEcomposition 
(tide.nki.nl) confirmed out of frame mutations in all RSL3-resistant clones (Supplementary 
Fig. 1i). In accordance with this, Acsl4 null cells did not show any differences in GSH and 
Gpx4 levels and Gpx4-specific activity that could provide an indirect mechanism of 
resistance towards RSL3 (Supplementary Fig. 1j,k). Corroborating with the essential role of 
Acsl4 and unequivocally implicating the importance of Acsl4 in ferroptosis, the re-
expression of human wildtype ACSL4_short (in the following referred to as ACSL4-FLAG) 
into the Acsl4 KO background regained full sensitivity to ferroptosis induction (Fig. 1d). 
Additionally, when Gpx4 was deleted in a TAM-inducible manner in the Acsl4 KO 
background, the double KO cells were fully viable after 72h upon TAM treatment (Fig. 1e) – 
this effect was not related to the kinetics of Gpx4 deletion. Moreover, the Acsl4/Gpx4 
double KO cells could be passaged for a period of more than 10 days, a remarkable finding 
as to the best of our knowledge no single cell line, ex vivo cultured cells or explants have 
survived in the absence of Gpx4 so far3, 15, 17, 18
Lipid oxidation upon Gpx4 inhibition requires Acsl4
In order to understand how loss of Acsl4 provides its protective effects, we analyzed known 
critical events in ferroptosis execution, such as mitochondrial morphology and lipid 
oxidation2, 8. Electron microscopy studies of Acsl4 WT and KO cells revealed a marked 
increased resistance of mitochondria to RSL3-induced outer membrane rupture (Fig. 2a). 
Acsl4 is a member of larger family of enzymes consisting of five distinct and related 
isoforms, which can be further subdivided into two groups, Acsl1/Acsl5/Acsl6 and Acsl3/
Acsl4, based on sequence homology19. We thus challenged the specificity of Acsl4 in 
ferroptosis by generating Pfa1 KO cell lines for all Acsl isoforms except Acsl6, which is not 
expressed in fibroblasts (Supplementary Table 3). Supplementary Fig. 2a illustrates that loss-
of expression of other Acsl family members did not have any impact on ferroptosis 
sensitivity compared to Acsl4. A list of all single cell clones carrying well-characterized out-
of-frame mutations for the different Acsl genes can be found in Supplementary Fig. 2b.

 Overexpression of rat Acsl1 or human ACSL3 (both tagged with GFP) failed to sensitize 
Pfal-CAS9_Acsl4−/− cells to undergo ferroptosis (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Corroborating the 
specific link to ferroptosis induction, we could further show that Acsl4 KO cells are also 
highly resistant to ferroptosis inducing agents other than RSL3 but not to alternative cell 
death inducing agents (Supplementary Fig. 2c).
Mechanistically, since lipid peroxidation is one hallmark of ferroptosis, we then estimated 
the levels of lipid peroxidation using first the lipid peroxidation-sensitive dye BODIPY 
581/591 C11 (BODIPY)2. Although BODIPY is usually readily oxidized when ferroptosis is 
elicited by RSL3, in the Acsl4 KO cells no sign of probe oxidation was detectable upon 
RSL3 treatment (Fig. 2b). Additionally, we further validated this finding using another 
independent probe (Spy-LHP) that detects lipid hydroperoxides confirming the data obtained 
by BODIPY 581/591 C11 staining20 (Fig. 2b). As a most recent genetic screen in haploid 
cell pointed to lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (Lpcat3) as an important player for 
ferroptosis induction21, presumably by modulating arachidonic acid metabolism, we 
challenged the effect of Lpcat3 in ferroptosis induction in response to RSL3 treatment and in 
our genetic model of ferroptosis induction. As shown in Fig. 2c, only a mild protective effect 
could be observed in Lpcat3−/− cells in stark contrast to the protection offered by Acsl4. This 
suggests that Acsl4 has a more widespread role in ferroptosis and that the function of Lpcat3 
is perhaps restricted to certain cellular subtypes.
Due to the function of Acsl4 in preferentially activating long PUFAs for phospholipid 
biosynthesis, we envisioned that they would be the most likely candidates to fuel the 
ferroptotic process. Therefore, we challenged this assumption by treating Acsl4 KO cells 
with a panel of fatty acids. We decided to use Acsl4 KO cells due to their inherent resistance 
to ferroptosis, which can be regained and modulated by supplementing with increasing 
concentrations of different FA. As such, this would help us to pinpoint critical fatty acids 
contributing to the ferroptotic process. To this end, Acsl4 KO cells were enriched with a 
mixture of BSA/fatty acids and, subsequently, ferroptosis was triggered using RSL3 to allow 
a well-defined kinetic of cell death induction. Surprisingly, ω6 fatty acids were able to 
further sensitize Acsl4 KO cells to undergo ferroptosis, whereas ω3 fatty acids only had a 
marginal or no effect (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Compared to ω3 fatty acids, the ω6 fatty 
acids were in general 5–10-fold more efficient in cell death induction, the only exception 
being docosahexaenoic acid. Moreover, this effect could be phenocopied by fatty acids 
containing 18 and 22 carbon long acyl chains. This is very noteworthy as the degree of 
unsaturation, which is directly related to the susceptibility to oxidative damage22, 23, appears 
to be less critical for ferroptosis induction compared to the position of the last double bond.
Insights into the underlying mechanisms for the protective effects conferred by Acsl4 came 
from an (oxi-)lipidomics approach using cells undergoing ferroptosis. A detailed analysis of 
potentially oxidized phospholipids generated during ferroptosis was performed in the 
accompanying manuscript by Kagan et al. This study pinpointed that arachidonic acid (AA)- 
and adrenic acid (AdA)-containing species in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) represented 
preferred substrates for oxidation. The respective oxidized species were elevated in WT 
MEFs treated with RSL3 as well as in Gpx4 KO cells, in agreement with our results from 
fatty acid-induced sensitization of Acsl4 KO cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a).

 Consistent with the key function of Acsl4 in the synthesis of long chain PUFA-CoA, 
particularly arachidonic acid-CoA (AA-CoA) and adrenic acid-CoA (AdA-CoA), the 
contents of AA-CoA and AdA-CoA were decreased approximately 4-fold (from 9.3 +/−1.2 
to 2.4 +/− 0.8 pmol/μmol of phospholipids) and 16-fold (from 3.2+/−1.1 to 0.2 pmol/μmol of 
phospholipids) in Acsl4−/− versus control cells, respectively (accompanying manuscript 
Kagan et al.). The levels of free AA and AdA did not follow this pattern remaining 
essentially unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Supporting a function of Acsl4 to channel 
AA and AdA for lipid biosynthesis, we found that AA- and AdA-containing 
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) species were markedly reduced in Acsl4 KO cells compared 
to WT cells (Fig. 3a,b). Significant reduction of the levels of AA-containing species along 
with a trend to a decreased level of AdA-containing species was also observed in 
phosphatidylinositol (PI) (Supplementary Fig. 3c). The effects were specific with regards to 
these anionic phospholipids as no significant decreases were revealed in phosphatidylcholine 
(PC) and in phosphatidylserine (PS) (Supplementary Fig. 3d,e). Finally, we compared the 
level of the recently described oxidized lipids formed in Acsl4 WT and KO cells treated with 
RSL3 (for details please see accompanying manuscript by Kagan et al.). Accordingly, 
genetic loss of Acsl4 suppressed the formation of doubly- and triply-oxidized AA- and 
AdA-containing PE species (Fig. 3c) in RSL3-treated samples. Overall, our data indicate 
that Acsl4 deficiency is accompanied by a significant and preferential decrease of AA- and 
AdA-containing PE species that are utilized as substrates to steer the ferroptotic cascade of 
events in the absence or inactivation of Gpx4.
Acsl4 sensitizes breast cancer cells to ferroptosis
Recently, it was reported that a subset of breast cancer cell lines shows a marked dependence 
on glutamine metabolism necessary to fuel System XC− 24, thus hinting at a potential link to 
ferroptosis. We sought to challenge this by treating a panel of breast cancer cells with the 
Gpx4 inhibitor RSL3. Interestingly, the cell lines that were reported to be auxotrophic for 
glutamine presented a marked sensitivity to RSL3 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 4a). 
Therefore, we next analyzed the expression of Acsl4 in these breast cancer cells. 
Intriguingly, Acsl4 was found to be preferentially expressed in a panel of basallike breast 
cancer cell lines (Fig. 4b), and its expression appeared to strongly correlate with the 
sensitivity to ferroptosis induction by RSL3. Most strikingly, only Acsl4 expression 
correlated to ferroptosis sensitivity as neither of the so far identified regulators of 
ferroptosis, namely intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels, System XC− and Gpx4 activity 
(Supplementary Fig. 4b) were shown to be down-regulated in the sensitive cell lines. 
Intriguingly, sensitive cells showed an even increased activity of System XC−, indicating a 
potential compensatory mechanism in susceptible cell lines. This was corroborated by the 
finding that TAM-inducible Gpx4−/− cells overexpressing the substrate specific subunit of 
System XC−, xCT (Slc7A11), are indeed protected from cell death (Supplementary Fig. 4c). 
Accordingly, this protection could be abolished by pharmacological inhibition of System 
XC− with ERA, further supporting the findings that double targeting of ferroptosis via 
System XC− and Gpx4 inhibition by RSL3 produced a dramatic additive effect in cells 
expressing ACSL4 in contrast to cells devoid of ACSL4 expression (Supplementary Fig. 4a). 
Interestingly, we could not detect a clear correlation between the levels of ACSL4 
expression and ferroptosis sensitivity (Fig. 4a,b). This was further evidenced when we used

 Acsl4 KO MEFs carrying a Doxycycline (Dox)-inducible ACSL4 expression system. Fig. 4c 
illustrates that just minute amounts of the protein are required to re-sensitize Acsl4 KO 
MEFs to RSL3 induced ferroptosis and that after a certain threshold increased levels of 
Acsl4 do not markedly increase sensitivity, thus supporting an all or nothing kind of 
response of Acsl4 in ferroptosis.
Additionally, to further corroborate the critical role of ACSL4, we abrogated ACSL4 
expression in MDA-MB-157 cells using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KO (Fig. 4d). Analysis of 
single cell clones transfected with Cas9 and a gRNA targeting ACSL4 showed that in all 
clones resistant to RSL3 ACSL4 expression was successfully abrogated (Fig. 4d). This 
resistance was not related to any general resistance mechanism as the ACSL4 KO tumor 
cells did not show any increased resistance in response to a broad panel of cell death 
inducers besides ferroptosis inducing agents (Supplementary Fig. 4d). Moreover, lipid 
peroxidation analysis using BODIPY 581/591 C11 again showed that these cells became 
refractory to lipid peroxidation (Fig. 4e). Finally, overexpression of ACSL4-FLAG in a 
subset of breast cancer cell lines that endogenously lack ACSL4 expression (Fig. 4f) was 
sufficient to sensitize them to undergo cell death and lipid peroxidation induced by RSL3 
(Fig. 4g,h). Importantly, the reexpression of ACSL4-FLAG specifically sensitized to RSL3-
induced ferroptosis as this form of cell death was shown to be prevented by canonical 
ferroptosis inhibitors, such as iron chelators (Ciclopirox olamine) and Liproxstatin-1 
(Supplementary Fig. 4e). Additionally, the pan-caspase apoptosis inhibitor ZVAD.fmk and 
the necroptosis inhibitor Nec1-s did not show any protective effect (Supplementary Fig. 4e), 
thus providing the rationale for eliciting ferroptosis in tumor cells expressing ACSL4.
Pharmacological Acsl4 inhibition prevents ferroptosis
We next sought to interrogate the possibility of pharmacologically blocking Acsl4 as a 
viable therapeutical approach in diseases with a ferroptotic signature. Early reports have 
shown that the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
gamma (PPARγ) agonist also selectively inhibits Acsl4 over other Acsl isoforms25. 
Therefore, by using distinct TZDs, namely rosiglitazone (ROSI), pioglitazone (PIO) and 
troglitazone (TRO), we found that all compounds prevented ferroptosis (Fig. 5a), as well as 
lipid peroxidation (Fig. 5b) induced by RSL3 treatment of cells. Interestingly, TRO was 
shown to be the most protective one despite being a less potent Acsl4 inhibitor25. This is 
most likely due to the chromanol ring (which provides tocopherols their antioxidant activity) 
and its inherent antioxidant activity (Supplementary Fig. 5a). As such it is envisioned that a 
combination of Acsl4 inhibitors with anti-ferroptotic compounds, such as Liproxstatin-1, 
would synergize. In fact, this was demonstrated in Supplementary Fig. 5b, suggesting that 
dual function inhibitors could be effective anti-ferroptotic agents. Moreover, since ROSI, 
PIO and TRO have been marketed as PPARγ agonists26, we asked whether the protective 
effects are at least in part related to PPARγ-mediated gene transcription. In fact, treating 
cells with non-thiazolinediones PPARγ agonists, such as GW1929 and Azelaoyl PAF, failed 
to rescue cells from RSL3-induced ferroptosis (Supplementary Fig. 5c), whereas ROSI 
protected against RSL3-induced ferroptosis in a manner like already observed in Acsl4 KO 
cells (Fig. 5a). Importantly, ROSI maintained its anti-ferroptotic effects even in Pparγ KO 
cells (Supplementary Fig. 5d,e).

 Subsequently, we expanded these findings and interrogated whether the protective effects 
conferred by ROSI is due to changes in the lipidome by mimicking Acsl4 deficiency. We 
thus analyzed all major PE species in WT and Acsl4 KO MEFs treated with ROSI (Fig. 
5c,d). ROSI treatment of WT MEFs phenocopied the lipidomic changes of PE triggered by 
Acsl4 depletion as shown by a decrease of AA and AdA containing PE species to the levels 
of Acsl4 KO cells (Fig. 5e). Moreover, treatment of Acsl4 KO cell with ROSI did not lead to 
any further decrease in AA and AdA containing PE, thus supporting the specific activity of 
ROSI on Acsl4 inhibition (Fig. 5d,e). Supporting the inhibitory effect of ROSI on Acsl4, 
principal component analysis clustered together Acsl4 KO and ROSI treated WT cells (Fig. 
5f)25.
To further evaluate if pharmacological inhibition of Acsl4 is a potential therapeutic 
opportunity to halt ferroptosis in vivo, we used a conditional KO model of Gpx4-deficiency, 
leading to acute renal failure and early death of mice approx. 10–12 days after knockout 
induction by TAM injection2. This mouse model represents one of few known in vivo 
models of ferroptosis, thus making it a suitable and reliable model to assess the in vivo 
efficacy of small molecules with anti-ferroptotic properties. Supporting the use of Acsl4 
inhibitors to halt ferroptosis in vivo, animals treated with ROSI had a significantly prolonged 
overall survival compared to vehicle treated animals (Fig. 5g).
DISCUSSION
Results provided here identify and establish an essential regulatory role for Acsl4 in the 
ferroptotic cell death process. Ferroptosis is a form of regulated necrotic cell death that is 
tightly controlled by Gpx4 as demonstrated by us and others2, 4. The inactivation of Gpx4 is 
believed to lead to increased levels of uncontrolled lipid peroxidation culminating in cell 
death, in vitro and in vivo, although critical players and metabolic constraints regulating this 
event have remained unknown.
In two independent functional screens we now demonstrate that Acsl4 is responsible for 
shaping the cellular lipidome by acting as an important node that determines sensitivity 
versus resistance to this form of cell death. Interestingly, during finalization of this 
manuscript, a study using haploid screens has also pinpointed to ACSL4 as an important 
player for RSL3-induced cell death, although the cellular mechanism and its functional 
implication in ferroptosis has not been addressed21. Enzymatically, Acsl4 is responsible for 
the esterification of CoA to free fatty acids in an ATP dependent manner. Formation of Acyl-
CoA activates the corresponding fatty acids for fatty acid oxidation or lipid biosynthesis. 
Specifically, Acsl4 has a marked preference for long polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as AA 
and AdA. Additionally, two isoforms are found in man and mouse. A short form of Acsl4 is 
localized to the inner side of the plasma membrane including microvilli and was also present 
in the cytosol. The long form has an additional N-terminal hydrophobic region that is 
exclusively expressed in neurons being located at the endoplasmic reticulum and on lipid 
droplets27.
Accordingly, experiments using exogenous supplementation of long chain fatty acids with 
different degrees of saturation and positions of the last double bond (i.e. ω3, ω6 ω9) have

 supported these findings showing that ferroptosis induction is in fact exacerbated in the 
presence of longer and more unsaturated fatty acids (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Interestingly, 
exogenous supplementation of AA/AdA (and other long PUFAs) is able to sensitize Acsl4 
KO cells to ferroptosis. This is rationalized based on the kinetical characteristic of different 
Acsl enzymes. For instance, the only two enzymes which efficiently use AA are Acsl3 
(Vmax/Kd=452*) and Acsl4 (Vmax/Kd=420*). Yet, overexpression of Acsl3 failed to 
sensitize cells to ferroptosis. This is most likely explained by the promiscuity of Acsl3 to 
other fatty acids, for instance Acsl3 also efficiently uses oleic acid, whereas Acsl4 does not 
(Vmax/Kd=470* and 35* respectively)28. As such, it is envisioned that at low AA/AdA and 
in the presence of other fatty acids Acsl4 will preferentially utilize AA/AdA for 
phospholipid synthesis and other fatty acids would outcompete AA/AdA usage by other 
Acsl. This notion is physiologically relevant as AA levels in plasma (mol% of total fatty 
acids) are at least one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of other fatty acids, such as 
oleic acid. For instance, in plasma free AA is believed to be in the low nanomolar range29. 
Therefore, Acsl4 appears to be a privileged enzyme utilizing arachidonic acid that can have 
its function being compensated in KO cells by poor AA utilizing Acsl enzymes when 
flooded with AA.
Particularly intriguing is the finding that up until now no other cell type such as cortical 
neurons15, fibroblasts15, vascular cells17, T cells and erythroid cells18, have been able to be 
cultured in the absence of Gpx4 under normal cell culture conditions. By stark contrast, 
Acsl4 and Gpx4 double KO cells were viable and proliferated normally in cell culture for an 
extended period of time, underscoring an important functional interplay between Gpx4 and 
Acsl4.
In addition to the unprecedented significance of Acsl4 in ferroptosis induction, we expanded 
this finding showing that Acsl4 is preferentially expressed in a subset of triple-negative 
breast cancer cell lines. Remarkably, Acsl4 expression clearly correlates with sensitivity to 
ferroptosis induction. This discovery provides intriguing consequences as some studies have 
already correlated Acsl4 expression levels with a more aggressive phenotype of cancer cells 
including increased invasiveness and proliferation30–33. The recognition that this subset of 
breast cancer is among the most difficult to treat34 highlights our findings that this group is 
in fact sensitive to ferroptosis induction, which stresses the urgency to develop in vivo 
efficacious ferroptosis inducing agents to specifically treat these otherwise poorly treatable 
tumor entities.
Moreover, data presented here show that ferroptosis can be efficiently inhibited by 
thiazolidinediones, a class of hypoglycemic drugs, and that this effect is mediated through 
inhibition of Acsl4 and not by their effect on Pparγ. Interestingly, these compounds have 
been already reported to ameliorate pathological conditions, where ferroptosis has been 
proposed to play a significant role including neurodegeneration, such as Huntington’s 
disease and dementia35, 36, liver necrosis37, 38 and in ischemia/reperfusion damage in tissues 
including brain, kidney, liver and heart39–43. This is in fact an intriguing finding as it may 
shed light on previous studies, where the beneficial activity of TZD could not be explained 
solely on their direct effects on PPARγ function. Interestingly, in all of these conditions 
TZD appeared to work preventively rather than therapeutically, meaning that they were

 efficacious when the treatment was initiated prior to the development of pathology. This is 
further supported by our in vivo and in vitro models experiments using ROSI showing that 
protection is achieved only when the treatment is applied before ferroptosis is elicited, thus 
allowing sufficient time for proper phospholipid remodeling.
Conclusively, we identify and characterize Acsl4-dependent modulation of phospholipids, 
specifically that of PE, as critical determinants of sensitivity to ferroptosis. Moreover, the 
expression of ACSL4 appears to be a predictive marker for ferroptosis sensitivity in different 
cellular contexts. Finally, the pharmacological inhibition of Acsl4 (for instance by TZD) 
might represent an attractive pharmacological intervention that could also explain some of 
the cytoprotective effects of TZD in different tissue pathologies, which certainly deserves 
further exploration and encourages revisiting some of the studies where TZD was 
demonstrated to confer beneficial effects.
ONLINE METHODS
Chemicals
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless stated otherwise. Fatty acids were 
purchased from Cayman Chemicals.
Cell lines
The TAM-inducible Gpx4−/− cells (Pfa1) were described previously15. Cells were 
maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal 
bovine serum (FBS) and cultured in a 37°C incubator with humidified atmosphere of 5% 
CO2 (Binder). Human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231, MDA-
MB-436, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-468, BT-549, HCC38, HCC1143, HCC1937, MCF7, 
T-47D, AU565, BT-474) were purchased from ATCC and cultured according to ATCC 
guidelines. SK-BR-3 cells were a kind gift from Dr. Gabriele Multhoff (Technical University 
Munich).
Assessment of lipid peroxidation using C11-BODIPY(581/591) and SPY-LHP staining and 
flow cytometry
150,000 cells/well were seeded in 6-well dishes (Nunc) one day prior to the experiment. On 
the next day, cells were treated with indicated concentrations of (1S, 3R)-RSL3 to induce 
ferroptosis. Cells were incubated with C11-BODIPY(581/591) (1 μM) or SPY-LHP (10 μM; 
Dojindo EU GmbH, Munich, Germany) for 30 min at 37°C in a tissue culture incubator 
before harvest by trypsinisation. Subsequently, cells were resuspended in 500 μL of fresh 
PBS (DPBS, Gibco) strained through a 35 μM cell strainer (Falcon tube with cell strainer 
CAP) and analyzed using the 488-nm laser of flow cytometer (FACS Canto II, BD 
Biosciences) for excitation. Data were collected from the FL1 detector (C11-BODIPY/Spy-
LHP) with a 502LP and 530/30 BP filter. At least 10,000 cells were analyzed per sample. 
Data analysis was conducted using the FlowJo Software.

 Cell viability assays
Aquabluer method—Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates (2000 cells per well) and 
treated with the compounds ((1S,3R)-RSL3, erastin, L-buthionine sulfoximine [BSO], 
dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO], menadione, tert-butylhydroperoxide [tBOOH], carbonyl 
cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone [FCCP], rotenone, nocodazole, 
sulphoraphane, etoposide, phenylarsine oxide [PAO], tunicamycin, staurosporine, irinotecan, 
mitoxanrone, paclitaxel, rapamycin, auranofin, vinoblastine, cytochalasin-D, rosiglitazone, 
pioglitazone, troglitazone, triacsin C GW1929, azelaoy PAF) after plating. Cell viability was 
assessed at different time points after treatment (usually 24 h, unless stated otherwise) using 
AquaBluer as an indicator of viable cells according to the manufacturer’s recommendations 
(MultiTarget Pharmaceuticals, LLC).
LDH release method—Pfa1 cells and derived cell clones were seeded onto 6-well plates 
(30,000 cells per well) and treated with 1 μM 4-OH-tamoxifen (TAM) after plating to induce 
the knockout of Gpx4. Cell death was quantified by measuring released lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) activity after different time points using the Cytotoxicity Detection 
Kit (LDH) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Diagnostics Deutschland).
Determination of intracellular GSH levels
Cells were seeded on a 6-well plate (1×105 cells per well) and cultured for 24 h as outlined 
above. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, extracted with 5% trichloroacetic 
acid, and then treated with ether to remove the trichloroacetic acid. Total glutathione content 
in the aqueous layer was measured using an enzymatic method, based on the catalytic action 
of glutathione in the reduction of 5,50-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) by the glutathione 
reductase system44.
Thiol measurement
To assay total mercaptans released into the medium, 200,000 cells were plated onto a 6-well 
plate and cultured overnight. Subsequently, the medium were removed and cells washed two 
times with PBS and covered in serum-free and phenol redfree media. Aliquots were 
subsequently collected at desired time points. Total mercaptans secreted into the cell culture 
medium were determined as described previously45 using GSH as a standard.
Gpx4-specific activity assay
Gpx4-specific activity using phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide as substrate was measured 
following the protocol previously described in46.
CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide recessive screen
In a similar approach as used in Koike-Yusa et al., Pfa1 cells stably expressing Cas9 were 
transduced by a lentiviral CRISPR-guide RNA library16 pseudotyped with the ecotropic 
envelope. This library contained 87,897 mouse gRNAs targeting 19,150 mouse protein 
coding genes. Transduction efficiency was adjusted to an MOI of 0.3 to avoid multiple 
infections with different gRNAs. Two days after infection, cells were selected with 
increasing concentrations of (1S, 3R)-RSL3 (25–50 nM) or ERA (3 μM) for 11 days.

 Genomic DNA was extracted from selected and unselected cells pools. Sample preparation 
was performed with primers designed to bind to the pKLV-U6gRNA (Bbsl)-
PGKpuro2ABFP library amplifying a product of 194 Bp encompassing the variable region 
(coding for the gRNA). By using different barcode sequences in the forward primer it was 
possible to combine all PCR products in a unimolecular ratio to form a next generation 
sequencing (NGS) library suitable for sequencing on an Ion Torrent P1 chip (PrimBio 
Research Institute, LLC, Exton, PA). Raw sequence results were provided as separate 
FASTQ files for each barcode. The necessary sgRNA guide information was extracted from 
single reads of the FASTQ file by counting the number of each sgRNA sequenced per 
sample.

 Transient expression of the CRISPR/Cas9 system
Cells were seeded on a 6-well plate (200,000) and cultured for 24 h. On the next day, cells 
were co-transfected by lipofection at a 1:1 ratio mix (usually 1 μg each) of a Cas9 expressing 
plasmid (pCAG-Flag-Nls-Cas9-Nls47) and the desired sgRNA expressing plasmid (pKLV-
U6gRNA-PGKpuro2aBFP) using the X-tremeGENE HP agent according to the 
manufacturer’s recommendations (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). After 2 days 
cells were plated onto a 15 cm plate at very low density (100–500 cells per 15 cm plate) and 
colonies were allowed to form during the course of 10 days. Single cell clones were picked 
and genotypes analyzed using sequence validation of the corresponding genomic locus. 
CRISPR/Cas9 induced deletion/insertions were detected using the TIDE: Tracking of Indels 
by DEcomposition (https://tide.nki.nl/) online tool48. Single clones with out-of-frame 
mutations were used for further analysis (Western blot/qPCR).
Stable expression of the CRISPR/Cas9 system
Pfa1 cells were infected with ecotropic lentivirus particles containing the LentiCas9-Blast 
construct in principle as described in49. After 48 h cells were selected with 10 μg/ml 
blasticidin for 5 days. Blasticidin-resistant cells were used for a second infection with 
ecotropic lentivirus particles containing the desired sgRNA expressing plasmid (pKLV-
U6gRNA-PGKpuro2ABFP). Two days after infection, cells were sorted on a BD Bioscience 
FACSARIA II using Blue Fluorescent Protein (BFP) as a marker. The BFP-positive cell 
population was seeded onto a 15 cm dish at very low density (100–500 cells per 15 cm plate) 
and colonies were allowed to form in the course of 10 days. For single clone analysis see 
protocol above.
qPCR analysis
RNA was extracted from exponentially growing cells using the RNeasy kit Mini Kit from 
Qiagen according to manufacturer’s instructions. 2 μg of total RNA was put into reverse 
transcription reactions using random primers for amplification (iScript™ cDNA Synthesis 
Kit-Bio-Rad). qPCR reactions were performed on the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System 
using gene specific TaqMan probes or specific primers in a SYBR GREEN reaction to detect 
expression levels. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) expression was 
used for normalization. The following TaqMan probes were used: Acsl3: Mm01255804_m1; 
Lpcat3: Mm00520147_m1; Pparγ: Mm00440940_m1; Hprt: Mm00446968_m1. The 
following primers were used for Acsl5 (Forward: 5′-
CTGATCTGCCTCCTGACGTTTGGAA-3′; Reverse: 5′-
ACAACGTCTTGGCGTCTGAGAAGT-3′) and Hprt (Forward: 5′-
AGCTACTGTAATGATCAGTCAACG-3′; Reverse: 5′-
AGAGGTCCTTTTCACCAGCA-3′).
Immunoblotting
Western blot analysis of cell lysates was performed essentially as described previously15, by 
using antibodies against Gpx4 (1:1000; no. ab125066, Abcam), Acsl1 (1:1000; no. 9189, 
Cell Signaling Technologies), Acsl4 (1:200; no. sc-271800, Santa Cruz), GFP (1:1000; no. 
gfp-1020, Aves) and β-actin (1:10000; no. A5441, Sigma).

 Microarray analysis
300 ng of high quality total RNA were amplified using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA 
Amplification kit (Ambion). Amplified cRNA was hybridised to Mouse Ref-8 v2.0 
Expression BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Staining and scanning were done 
according to the Illumina expression protocol. Data was processed using the 
GenomeStudioV2010.1software (gene expression module version 1.6.0) in combination 
with the MouseRef-8_V2_0_R3_11278551_A.bgx annotation file. The background 
subtraction option was used and an offset to remove remaining negative expression values 
was introduced. In the heat map, each column represents a value of a single experiments 
performed three times independently.
RNAseq analysis
Transcriptome analysis, quantitative library preparation and enrichment were performed as 
described in50. RNA libraries were assessed for quality and quantity with the Agilent 2100 
BioAnalyzer and the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Life Technologies) and 
sequenced as 100 bp paired-end runs on an Illumina HiSeq2500 platform.
Transmission electron microscopy of Acsl4 WT and KO cells
Cell pellets were fixed in 2.5% electron microscopy grade glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium 
cacodylate buffer pH 7.4 (Science Services, Munich, Germany), postfixed in 2% aqueous 
osmium tetraoxide, dehydrated in gradual ethanol (30–100%) and propylene oxide, 
embedded in Epon (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and cured for 24 h at 60°C. Semithin 
sections were prepared and stained with toluidine blue. Ultrathin sections (50 nm) were 
placed onto 200 mesh copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before 
transmission electron microscopy analysis (Zeiss Libra 120 Plus, Carl Zeiss NTS GmbH, 
Oberkochen, Germany). Pictures were taken using Slow Scan CCD-camera and iTEM 
software (Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions, Münster, Germany).
Fatty acid-dependent sensitization of ferroptosis
Pfa1_Acsl4−/− cells were seeded onto 96-well plates (2000 cells per well). After cells 
adhered to the cell culture dish (approximately 6h after plating), they were treated for 16h 
with different concentrations of fatty acids (archidic acid, oleic acid, eicosaeonic acid, (11, 
14) eicosadienoic acid, (5, 8, 11) eicosatrienoic acid, (11, 14, 17) eicosatrienoic acid, (8, 11, 
14) eicosatrienoic acid, γ-linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid, linoleic acid, AA, AdA, 
docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid) solved in 10% fatty acid-free BSA. 
Subsequently, cells where treated with/without 100 nM (1S, 3R)-RSL3 and viability was 
assessed 4h thereafter using AquaBluer as described above.
Doxycycline-inducible expression of ACSL4-FLAG
Human ACSL4-FLAG was cloned in the doxycyclin inducible expression vector pRTS151, 
kindly provided by Dr. G. W. Bornkamm. Acsl4 KO PFa1 cells were electroporated with the 
cloned construct and selected with hygromycin (600 μg/ml) for at least 3 weeks. Single cell 
clones were selected and the doxycycline-inducible ACSL4-FLAG expression was verified 
by western blot after cells were treated for 24 h with 1 μM doxycycline. In order to

 determine the amount of ACSL4-FLAG necessary for ferroptosis execution, 96-well plates 
were seeded with 2000 cells per well, treated overnight with increasing concentrations of 
doxycycline, and subsequently ferroptosis was induced by addition of 120 nM RSL3. On the 
next day, the cell viability was assessed using the Aquabluer assay. In parallel 6-well plates 
containing 100,000 cells were treated overnight with the same concentrations of doxycycline 
to determine the ACSL4 expression levels via western blot.
Measurement of antioxidant/radical trapping activity
Substances (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, troglitazone, triacsin C, α-tocopherol, DMSO) were 
diluted in methanol and pipetted in a 96-well plate in triplicates. Di(phenyl)-(2,4,6-
trinitrophenyl)iminoazanium (DPPH) solution (final concentration 200 μM) was added to 
start the reaction. After the equilibrium settled (in generally after 1h) the absorbance was 
measured at 520 nm using a SpectraMax M5 instrument.
Mass spectrometry analysis
Redox-lipidomics analysis was performed as previously described2 and as further detailed in 
the accompanying manuscript by Kagan et al.
Inducible disruption of Gpx4 in mice
The generation of mice with a TAM-inducible full body deletion of Gpx4 except brain 
(referred to as CreERT2;Gpx4fl/fl; fl, floxed) was detailed previously2. In brief, TAM 
treatment of these mice causes loss of Gpx4 expression in kidney (and other tissues), acute 
renal failure and death at approx. 12 days post induction. To achieve inducible disruption of 
the floxed Gpx4 allele(s), mice (>8 weeks of age; male and female) were injected twice with 
0.5 mg 4-OH-Tamoxifen (TAM) dissolved in Miglyol.
In vivo treatment of TAM-inducible Gpx4−/− mice with rosiglitazone
Animals included in the treatment study of TAM-inducible Gpx4−/− mice were equally 
distributed between sex and weight, with typically 8–10 weeks of age. The average weight 
within the groups was between 22 and 24 g. Groups were formed to have comparable 
numbers of females/males of the same age. Animal weight was arranged to have a similar 
distribution between females and males. For the pharmacological inhibitor experiments, 
CreERT2;Gpx4fl/fl mice were injected on day 0 and 2 with 0.5 mg TAM dissolved in 
Miglyol. ROSI was administrated in the drinking water (0.0125 mg/ml) along with vehicle 
control (1% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in water) 1 week prior to the TAM injections; 
drinking water was replaced every second day continually during the whole experiment. 
Survival analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism software and statistical analysis 
was done according to the log-rank (Mantel_Cox) test. The compounds, vehicle and ROSI, 
were both odorless and colorless ensuring no detectable bias. Daily animal assessment was 
performed in a blinded fashion. When animals showed terminal signs, they were euthanized. 
No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size for the treatment of the Gpx4−/− 
mice. Mice were kept under standard conditions with food and water ad libitum (ssniff). All 
experiments were performed in compliance with the German Animal Welfare Law and have

 Fig. 1. Identification of Acsl4 as an essential pre-requisite for ferroptosis execution
(a) Top, time-dependent increase of LDH release in Pfa1 cells and RSL3-resistant clones 
(cB1, cB3 and cB7) upon Gpx4 knockout induction. Below, Gpx4 immunoblot analysis 48 h 
after TAM treatment. (b) Heat maps of the 16 most down-regulated genes as detected by 
microarray analysis (Parental vs cB1/cB4/cB7 p<0.01). (c) Top 12 gRNAs identified in the 
population selected either with RSL3 (100 nM) or with ERA (1 μM). (d) Pfa1_Acsl4 KO 
(Acsl4−/−) cells are refractory to ferroptosis, which can be re-sensitized by Flag-tagged 
hACSL4 (ACSL4-FLAG) re-expression. Dose-dependent cytotoxicity of RSL3 was assessed 
24 h after treatment using AquaBluer. Immunoblot depicts re-expression of ACSL4-FLAG 
in Pfa1_Acsl4 KO cells. (e) Time-dependent increase of LDH release was assayed in a 96 
well plate using Pfa1_Acsl4 KO (Acsl4−/−) and Pfa1_Acsl4 WT (Acsl4 +/+) cells during 
KO induction. Immunoblot analysis of Gpx4 is shown at different time points after TAM 
treatment. Data shown represents the mean ± s.d. of n = 3 wells from a representative 
experiment performed independently two times (a), three times (d) or four times (e).

 Fig. 2. Acsl4 specifically contributes to ferroptotic cell death
(a) Ultrastructural analysis revealed that upon RSL3 treatment Acsl4 WT cells unlike KO 
cells show outer membrane rupture (red arrows) as reported2 (Scale bars: 500 nm). (b) RSL3 
induced lipid oxidation in WT Pfa1 cells (Acsl4 +/+) unlike in Pfa1_Acsl4 KO cells 
(Acsl4−/−) as determined by BODIPY 581/591 C11 and SPY-LHP oxidation at the indicated 
time points. (c) Knockout of Lpcat3 weakly protected against ferroptosis. Cell viability was 
determined 24 h after RSL3 treatment using AquaBluer. qPCR analysis indicates the relative 
expression of Lpcat3 in Pfa1 WT, Acsl4 −/− and Lpcat3 −/− cells. Time-dependent increase 
of LDH release in Pfa1_Acsl4 KO (Acsl4 −/−) and Pfa1_Acsl4 WT (Acls4 +/+) and 
Pfa1_Lpcat3 KO (Lpcat3 −/−) cells with or without TAM treatment. Data shown in and (c) 
represents the mean ± s.d. of n = 3 wells from a representative experiment performed
