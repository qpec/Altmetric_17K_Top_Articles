Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of current hand amputees reveals
evidence for neuronal-level changes in former sensorimotor cortex. J
Neurophysiol 117: 1821–1830, 2017. First published February 8,
2017; doi:10.1152/jn.00329.2016.—Deafferentation is accompanied
by large-scale functional reorganization of maps in the primary
sensory and motor areas of the hemisphere contralateral to injury.
Animal models of deafferentation suggest a variety of cellular-level
changes including depression of neuronal metabolism and even neu-
ronal death. Whether similar neuronal changes contribute to patterns
of reorganization within the contralateral sensorimotor cortex of
chronic human amputees is uncertain. We used functional MRI-
guided proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to test the hypothesis
that unilateral deafferentation is associated with lower levels of
N-acetylaspartate (NAA, a putative marker of neuronal integrity) in
the sensorimotor hand territory located contralateral to the missing
hand in chronic amputees (n � 19) compared with the analogous hand
territory of age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n � 28). We also
tested whether former amputees [i.e., recipients of replanted (n � 3)
or transplanted (n � 2) hands] exhibit NAA levels that are indistin-
guishable from controls, possible evidence for reversal of the effects
of deafferentation. As predicted, relative to controls, current amputees
exhibited lower levels of NAA that were negatively and significantly
correlated with the time after amputation. Contrary to our prediction,
NAA levels in both replanted and transplanted patients fell within the
range of the current amputees. We suggest that lower levels of NAA
in current amputees reflects altered neuronal integrity consequent to
chronic deafferentation. Thus local changes in NAA levels may
provide a means of assessing neuroplastic changes in deafferented
cortex. Results from former amputees suggest that these changes may
not be readily reversible through reafferentation.
NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study is the first to use functional
magnetic resonance-guided magnetic resonance spectroscopy to ex-
amine neurochemical mechanisms underlying functional reorganiza-
tion in the primary somatosensory and motor cortices consequent to
upper extremity amputation and its potential reversal through hand
replantation or transplantation. We provide evidence for selective
alteration of cortical neuronal integrity associated with amputation-
related deafferentation that may not be reversible.

EXTENSIVE STUDIES of animal models indicate that deafferenting
injuries induce functional brain reorganization in the primary
somatosensory and motor cortices contralateral to the injury
(Kaas, 1991; Merzenich et al., 1984). This reorganization is
characterized by a robust increase of cortical space occupied by
spared sensory inputs or motor outputs at the expense of lost
inputs/outputs and is attributable to several mechanisms oper-
ating over different timescales. Acute changes, apparent within
minutes or hours of deafferentation, have been linked to the
unmasking of existing yet functionally inhibited intracortical
synapses and the modulation of synaptic efficacy (Jacobs and
Donoghue, 1991; Kaas, 2000). Chronically deafferented ani-
mals exhibit additional synaptic plasticity as well as evidence
for structural changes (Buonomano and Merzenich, 1998).
Specifically, progressive neuronal degeneration, including
withdrawal of the deafferented axons from the somatosensory
cortex and changes in neuronal morphology [for reviews, see
Feldman and Brecht (2005) and Holtmaat and Svoboda
(2009)], loss and dysfunction of inhibitory neurons (Ralston et
al., 1996; Welker et al., 1989), and structural changes in
surviving neurons (Jones et al., 2002; Navarro et al., 2007;
Schubert et al., 2013) have all been reported. It has been
assumed that similar neural mechanisms underlie well-docu-
mented chronic postamputation cortical reorganization in hu-
mans. However, no direct evidence for this postulation has
existed because of lack of a noninvasive means to evaluate the
human brain at the cellular level. Likewise, whether such
chronic changes can be reversed by restoration of afferent and
efferent activity between the hand and brain remains unknown.
Here, we report the first attempt to address these issues in
humans through functional MRI-guided proton magnetic res-
onance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in a cohort of unilateral hand
amputees and a small number of former amputees, i.e., indi-
viduals either who have undergone replantation of their own
hands shortly after injury or who have received allogeneic hand

 transplants in subsequent years. 1H-MRS is uniquely able to
measure microscopic neural state, by means of biomarkers
related to neuronal and glial health, inflammation, and intra-
cortical excitability/inhibition, in discrete regions of the human
brain (Van Zijl and Barker, 1997). We specifically investigated
whether there are indications of changes in neuronal integrity
in the deafferented/deefferented hand territory, which, as will
soon be described, was functionally defined using functional
MRI (fMRI). This study builds on our prior studies in stroke
(Cirstea et al., 2011, 2014; Craciunas et al., 2013) and literature
on other neurological disorders [for review, see Moffett et al.
(2007)] that established a relationship between a neuronal
biomarker, N-acteylaspartate (NAA), and behaviorally relevant
neurophysiological brain changes. Despite more than 50 years
of research, the role of NAA, detected almost exclusively in
neurons and their processes, remains controversial. Hypotheses
include involvement in myelin synthesis, neuronal energetics,
osmoregulation, and axonal-glial signaling. Thus NAA is con-
sidered a general biomarker of neuronal health, viability, and
amount (Baslow 2003; Moffett et al., 2007).
To our knowledge, there exists only one other published
study using 1H-MRS in similar populations (Ertem et al.,
2005). Ertem et al. found a trend toward lower NAA levels in
the contralateral vs. ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex at an aver-
age of 26 mo after replantation of the amputated hand in nine
former amputees. This result was interpreted as evidence for
the absence of dramatic alterations in neuronal integrity in the
sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the replanted hand. Note
that hand replantation must occur within hours of amputation.
Therefore the question of whether such changes manifest
during chronic amputation remains unknown, as does whether
such long-standing alterations can be reversed following trans-
plantation. Furthermore, it is possible that changes in NAA
contralateral to the replanted hand could have been underesti-
mated by comparing against the ipsilateral sensorimotor cor-
tex. The reason for this is that unilateral amputation induces
reorganizational changes in both cerebral hemispheres (Bog-
danov et al., 2012; Hamzei et al., 2001; Knecht et al., 1996;
Philip and Frey, 2014), and on the basis of work in animal
models, these changes begin immediately (Calford and
Tweedale, 1988). Nevertheless, the trend toward lower con-
tralateral NAA in this initial report is suggestive of possible
cortical neuronal-level changes associated with unilateral hand
loss and serves as an important motivation for the current
study.
Here, we used 1H-MRS to assess NAA levels in the func-
tionally defined sensorimotor hand territories of chronic uni-
lateral hand amputees (n � 19) and in several former ampu-
tees, i.e., hand replant (n � 3) and hand transplant (n � 2)
recipients. Age- and sex-matched controls (n � 28) were
evaluated to estimate the preamputation levels of NAA in the
sensorimotor hand territories. On the basis of the aforemen-
tioned neurodegenerative cortical events reported after limb
loss (Feldman and Brecht, 2005; Holtmaat and Svoboda, 2009;
Ralston et al., 1996; Welker et al., 1989) and the observations
from spinal cord injuries (Hains et al., 2003; Wrigley et al.,
2009) and cervical spondylotic myelopathy (Kowalczyk et al.,
2012), we predicted that the levels of NAA would be lower in
the sensorimotor hand territory contralateral to the missing
hand (former) in current amputees relative to healthy controls.
On the basis of the well-proven dependence of the neural
organization of the sensorimotor cortex on incoming activity
(Holtmaat and Svoboda, 2009), we hypothesized that NAA
levels in the sensorimotor hand territory contralateral to the
replanted or transplanted hand in the former amputees should
not differ from levels in healthy controls because of restoration
of afferent and efferent activity.
In addition to the primary hypotheses concerning NAA, we
tested several secondary predictions involving four other neu-
rochemicals: myo-inositol (mIn, considered a putative glial
marker), glutamate-glutamine (Glx, a marker of glutamatergic
neurotransmission), choline (Cho, a marker of cellular mem-
brane turnover), and creatine (Cr, central energy marker of
both neurons and astrocytes). In the contralateral (former hand)
territory of the current amputees, we expected to find 1) higher
mIn, based on the relationship between neuronal cell death/
depression and reactive gliosis (Ding et al., 2000); 2) higher
Glx, particularly in those who experience pain due to the
hyperexcitability of nociceptive pathways (Knecht et al.,
1996); and 3) no Cho or Cr changes (based on the slim chance
of altered cell membrane integrity or changes in brain energet-
ics in this chronic stage). As for NAA, we expected to find no
significant changes in these secondary neurochemicals in for-
mer amputees compared with controls. For the reasons de-
scribed for NAA above, we also explored the neurochemical
profile of hand territory ipsilateral (intact) to the amputation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants. Patients tested were 19 current, unilateral, upper limb
amputees [8 women, age 45.6 � 15.7 (SD) yr] and 5 former unilateral
amputees; 3 of the former amputees received autologous hand replan-
tation (all men, 53.7 � 11.9 yr), and 2 underwent allogeneic hand
transplantation (men, 44.5 � 7.8 yr). Controls were 28 healthy indi-
viduals matched for sex, age, and hand dominance (11 women,
42.0 � 12.6 yr). All participants completed the study after providing
written informed consent in accordance with the Institutional Review
Board at the University of Missouri, which approved this study.
As summarized in Tables 1 and 2, all patients experienced a
traumatic unilateral transradial (below elbow, 52%) or transhumeral
(above elbow, 48%) amputation as an adult at least 2 yr before
participating in our study. Four amputees (21%) lost their left hand.
The average time elapsed since the amputation was 13.8 � 13.2 yr
(Table 1). In the transplanted patients, the mean time between the
injury and surgical transplantation was 7.8 � 7.4 yr (Table 2). Hand
replantation generally occurred within 6 h of amputation.
Patients and healthy individuals were excluded if there was a prior
history of brain injury, neurological disease, major psychiatric disor-
der, substance/alcohol abuse or dependence, or MRI contraindica-
tions. There were no group differences for age (control vs. amputee,
P � 0.4), sex (39% female in control vs. 42% in amputee), or hand
dominance [all participants were right hand dominant, Edinburgh
Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971)].
Clinical evaluation. Given evidence implicating cortical sensori-
motor reorganization in postamputation pain (Flor et al., 2006, 2013),
we carefully differentiated phantom limb pain (PLP) vs. residual limb
pain (RLP) in our participants and explored whether these symptoms
were related to the neurochemical profile of the former hand territory.
PLP in current amputees and pain in the replanted/transplanted hand
of former amputees were assessed with the Neuropathic Pain Scale
[NPS; Galer and Jensen (1997)] and short form of the McGill Pain
Questionnaire (SF-MPQ; Melzack (1987)]. The intensity of PLP or
replanted/transplanted hand pain bursts was assessed on a scale
ranging from 0 � no pain to 10 � severe pain. A similar scale
(ranging from 0 to 10) was also used to assess the intensity of RLP in
current amputees. These data are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. These

amputees and the frequency of prosthesis use in current amputees.
Neuroimaging methods. MRI/1H-MRS data were collected on a
Siemens 3T Trio MR system using an eight-channel birdcage head
coil within a 24-h period after clinical evaluation. High-resolution
T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired parallel to the anterior
commissure-posterior commissure axis with a magnetization-prepared
rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence [repetition time (TR) �
1,900 ms; echo time (TE) � 3.2 ms; flip angle � 9°; matrix size, 256 �
215; in-plane resolution, 0.9 � 0.9 mm; 176 contiguous axial slices;
thickness, 0.9 mm; field of view (FOV) � 230 � 201 mm; scan time,
5.53 min].
To accurately identify our region of interest (ROI; the sensorimotor
hand territories in both hemispheres), we used a gradient echo blood
oxygen level-dependent scan (BOLD; TR, 2,500 ms; TE, 30 ms;
matrix size, 64 � 64; 36 contiguous axial slices; in-plane resolution,
4 � 4 mm; thickness, 4 mm; no skip; FOV, 256 � 256 mm; scan time,
3 min) to functionally define these territories. Two alternating condi-
tions were repeated: movement condition (25 s), where participants
were visually cued to flex and extend the fingers of both hands (only
the intact hand in amputees), and rest condition (25 s), where partic-
ipants were motionless. This task was designed on the basis of
evidence of bilateral sensorimotor activation exhibited by movement
(or stimulation) of the intact hand/limb in deafferented patients
(Bogdanov et al., 2012) and animals (Pelled et al., 2007), respectively.
BOLD data were analyzed using the scanner analysis software to
guide the 1H-MRS imaging (1H-MRSI) slab positioning. Specifically,
our task-related activations were mainly located on the middle genu of
the central sulcus (or omega shape structure) and directly opposite of
this structure on the anterior face of the postcentral gyrus (Bogdanov
et al., 2012; Cirstea et al., 2011; Ward et al., 2003; Yousry et al.,
1997), a well-known area to represent the hand sensorimotor function
(Yousry et al., 1997). Four slices corresponding to the larger activated
sensorimotor hand areas were selected by visual inspection (see Fig.
1A) and then used to identify the corresponding coincident T1-
weighted image, on which the 1H-MRSI slab was centered. Thus the
1H-MRSI slab spanned the central sulcus and extended rostrally into
the precentral gyrus and caudally into the postcentral gyrus (see Fig.
1B). The slab orientation was parallel to the anterior commissure-
posterior commissure line.
1H-MRSI acquisition. 1H-MRSI was performed with a point-re-
solved spectroscopy sequence, both with and without water suppres-
sion (PRESS; TR, 1,700 ms; TE, 30 ms, matrix size, 16 � 16;
thickness, 15 mm; interpolated in-plane resolution, 5 � 5 mm2; FOV,
160 mm; spectral width, 1,200 Hz, scan time, 6.53 min). Chemical
spectra were obtained via suppressing the water signal by means of a
chemical shift-selective saturation pulse with a bandwidth of 50 Hz.
The signal of unsuppressed water was also acquired. Scalp lipid
artifact was minimized with eight 30-mm outer voxel suppression
bands prescribed around the 1H-MRS excitation volume. Automated,
followed by manual, shimming was performed to achieve a width at
half height of the water peak below 20 Hz (Cirstea et al., 2011).

 1H-MRSI data postprocessing. 1H-MRSI data were reconstructed
using the scanner software. A Hamming filter implemented by the
vendor software was applied before spatial reconstruction, which
resulted in an increased effective voxel size by 30%. The final
effective voxel size was 19.4 mm estimated with the full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of the point spread function reflecting a circular
k-space sampling and the Hamming filter. Neurochemical concentra-
tions were quantified via LCModel (version 6.3-1H, linear combina-
tion of model spectra). We used PRESS basis set [including aspartate,
creatine, GABA, glucose, glutamine, glutamate, glycerophosphocho-
line, phosphocholine, mIn, NAA, N-acetylaspartylglutamate, scyllo-
inositol, taurine, and guanine; Provencher (2001)] and water as an
internal concentration reference (Gasparovic et al., 2006). Figure 1C
shows an MRS spectrum in the range of 0.2–4.0 ppm, including our
target neurochemical, NAA, and four secondary neurochemicals that
were also included for exploratory purposes: mIn, Glx, Cho, and Cr
(see Table 3).
Custom MATLAB (2014; MathWorks, Natick, MA) programs
were used to coregister the quantitative MRS output (from LCModel)
on each individual’s T1-weighted anatomical image. T1-weighted
images were segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebro-
spinal fluid using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8; Wellcome
Trust Center for Neuroimaging, University College London, London,
United Kingdom). Volumes of gray matter and white matter per MRSI
voxels were calculated using the segmented T1-weighted images by
incorporating the point spread function of MRSI and the slice selec-
tion profile (Weber-Fahr et al., 2002).
The MRS voxels were selected from a similar sensorimotor terri-
tory in all participants using the anatomical landmarks [Fig. 1B;
Yousry et al. (1997)] as well as the presence of functional activation.
Only the spectroscopic voxels with the following criteria (Cirstea et
al., 2011, 2014; Craciunas et al., 2013) were included into data
analysis: signal-to-noise ratio [which is defined by the LCModel
analysis program as the ratio between the difference between the
maximum in the acquired spectrum and baseline and 2 times root-
mean-square of residuals (Freeman, 1988)] �10, FWHM of the
neurochemicals �20 Hz, and brain tissue (gray matter and white
matter) volume �75%. A similar number of spectroscopic voxels was
selected for all participants (left hemisphere: controls, 6 � 1 voxels;
current amputees, 6 � 1; transplanted, 5 � 0; replanted, 4 � 1; right
hemisphere: controls, 5 � 1; current amputees, 5 � 1; transplanted,
4 � 0; replanted, 4 � 0).
From each MRS voxel, any neurochemical with Cramér-Rao lower
bounds values �15% were included into data analysis. MR spectra
with obvious lipid signal contribution or artifacts (double peaks, etc.)
were discarded. The neurochemical concentrations were then cor-
rected for brain tissue volume obtained from the corresponding MRS
voxel as follows: c � cLCModel � [1/Vbrain], where c is the cor-
rected concentration, cLCModel is absolute concentration from
LCModel (mmol/kg wet wt, mM), and Vbrain is the brain tissue (gray
matter and white matter) volume. Finally, for each ROI, we averaged
(mean � SD) the corrected neurochemical absolute concentrations
and the brain tissue volumes from the selected MRS voxels.
For purposes of averaging, data from the four amputees and one
transplant recipient who had lost their left hands were left-right
flipped so that the “left” hemisphere was contralateral to the affected
limb. This same manipulation was done to data from five age- and
sex-matched controls.
Statistical analysis of MRS data. Statistical analyses were per-
formed using SPSS Statistics (version 23.0; Chicago, IL). NAA (and
mIn, Glx, Cho, and Cr) absolute concentrations were extracted from
one ROI (primary sensorimotor hand area) in two hemispheres (left/
contralateral to the missing hand and right/ipsilateral) and two groups
(control and current amputee), and the means and SDs were com-
puted. Smirnov normality tests revealed that neurochemical levels
were normally distributed in control and amputee groups (P � 0.05

variance (mixed ANOVA). Significant effects were further evalu-
ated with Bonferroni-corrected t-tests. Given the small sample

between NAA (and secondary neurochemicals), time after ampu-

in each group were within recommended tolerances (left hemi-

replanted, 15.2 � 2.9; transplanted, 16.1 � 3.4). The FWHM
of all neurochemicals included in the data analysis was �12.3
Hz in all participants, reflecting high spectral resolution [Jan-
sen et al. (2006); left hemisphere: controls, 5.5 � 1.4 Hz;
current amputees, 6.0 � 1.6 Hz; replanted, 6.0 � 0.2 Hz; trans-
planted, 5.7 � 11.1 Hz; right hemisphere: controls, 5.0 � 9.8
Hz, current amputees, 5.8 � 1.1 Hz; replanted, 5.0 � 0.6 Hz;
transplanted, 6.2 � 0.9 Hz].
ROI brain tissue (gray matter and white matter) volumes
were similar between groups and hemispheres. Similar brain
tissue volumes (from SPM8) within ROI were found in each
group (left vs. contralateral hemisphere to the missing hand:
90.8 � 0.1 vs. 87.0 � 0.1%, P � 0.3; right vs. ipsilateral
hemisphere: 93.1 � 0.05 vs. 92.3 � 0.1%, P � 0.6). Similar
volumes were also found between hemispheres in controls (left
vs. right, P � 0.2) and current amputees (contralateral vs.
ipsilateral, P � 0.1). The brain tissue volumes for both left and
right ROIs in former amputees fell within a 95% confidence
interval of either group (Table 3).
Healthy controls show similar interhemispheric levels of
NAA and secondary neurochemicals. Similar to our previous
work (Cirstea et al., 2011), there were no significant differences in
any of the neurochemical measures between left and right senso-
rimotor hand territories in healthy controls (NAA, F1,56 � 0.9,
P � 0.3; mIn, F1,56 � 0.1, P � 0.7; Glx, F1,56 � 0.5, P � 0.5;
Cho, F1,56 � 0.2, P � 0.7; Cr, F1,56 � 0.3, P � 0.6; Fig. 2A and
Table 3). No correlations were found between age and the neu-
rochemical levels (P � 0.5 for both left and right ROIs; for NAA,
left, r � �0.01, P � 0.95; right, r � �0.06, P � 0.75).
Current amputees exhibit lower contralateral NAA levels,
unaltered ipsilateral NAA levels, and unaltered secondary
neurochemicals in either contralateral or ipsilateral hand
territories. Contrary to controls, amputees displayed signifi-
cantly lower NAA in the hand territory contralateral vs. ipsi-
lateral to the missing hand (7.4 � 0.7 vs. 9.1 � 1.4 mM,
F1,38 � 24.9, P � 0.001; Fig. 2A). This result was specific to
NAA and was not found for mIn, Glx, Cho, or Cr (F1,38 � 1.8,
P � 0.2; F1,38 � 4.1, P � 0.05; F1,38 � 0.3, P � 0.6; and
F1,38 � 0.1, P � 0.7; respectively).
As predicted, relative to controls, the current amputees
exhibited significantly lower NAA in the hand territory con-
tralateral to the missing hand (controls, 8.4 � 1.3 mM vs.
amputees, 7.4 � 0.7 mM, �12.8% difference, F1,47 � 10.9,
P � 0.002; Table 3 and Fig. 2B). The mean of the control
group fell with 95% certainty within the range of 7.9–8.9 mM
while that of the current amputees fell within the range of
6.8–7.9 mM (Table 3). We also examined the effect of time on
NAA levels and found a significant inverse relationship be-
tween contralateral NAA and years postinjury (r � �0.54,

controlling for age (r � �0.51, P � 0.03). This result may
reflect a central neurodegenerative phenomenon associated

 tween NAA and PLP scores were of moderate strength (burst
pain, r � 0.44, P � 0.07; NPS, r � 0.43, P � 0.07; SF-MPQ,
r � 0.46, P � 0.06), they did not reach statistical significance.
A nonsignificant correlation was also found between NAA and
the RLP intensity (r � �0.34, P � 0.16).
Importantly, pain scores were not significantly correlated
with time after amputation (P varied between 0.2 and 0.9) or
age (P varied between 0.5 and 0.8).
Pain medication does not have an effect on contralateral
NAA levels in current amputees. Because 47% of current
amputees are pain medicated, we also investigated medication
effects on NAA levels. Since we expected a generalized effect,
we investigated bilateral NAA levels in two subgroups of
patients: pain medicated (n � 9; 55% female; age, 52.4 � 14.3
yr; time postamputation, 13.7 � 16.1 yr) vs. unmedicated (n �
10; 30% female; age, 39.4 � 14.9 yr; time postamputation,
12.8 � 10.5 yr). We found that interhemispheric differences in
NAA levels persisted in both medicated (7.1 � 0.7 mM in
contralateral vs. 9.4 � 1.5 mM in ipsilateral territory, paired
t-test, P � 0.001) and unmedicated (7.5 � 0.7 vs. 8.9 � 1.2
mM, P � 0.001) subgroups. Furthermore, relative to controls,
both medicated and unmedicated subgroups displayed signifi-
cantly lower levels of NAA contralaterally (8.4 � 1.3 mM in
controls vs. 7.1 � 0.7 mM, P � 0.001, and vs. 7.5 � 0.7 mM,
P � 0.01, respectively; Fig. 3B). Because the medicated
subgroup is significantly older than controls (42.0 � 12.6 yr,
P � 0.04), we also explored the effects of age on contralateral
NAA levels but found no significant correlation (r � �0.1,
P � 0.8). Overall, these findings are consistent with the lack of
a relationship between NAA changes in the former hand
territory and use of pain medication.
Former amputees demonstrate NAA and secondary neuro-
chemical levels comparable with current amputees. Contrary
to our hypothesis that after reafferentation the neuronal state
would be similar to its status before injury, the NAA levels of
two (out of 3) immediate hand replant patients and both
allogeneic hand transplant patients fell within the range of the
current amputees (Table 3 and Fig. 2B). This was also the case
for mIn but not for Glx, Cho, and Cr, which fell within the
control range (Table 3). Although the ipsilateral NAA, mIn,
Glx, and Cr in most former amputees fell out of either group
range, the ipsilateral Cho fell within the range of either group
(Table 3).
The minimum sample size of former amputees needed to
detect a difference of 1.0 mM in mean NAA levels (with a
power of 80% and confidence of 95%) was calculated to be 16.
We expected the power to be lower for the former amputees
(who are rare), and thus we interpret these results with caution.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence
for alteration of cortical neuronal integrity associated with
postamputation deafferentation/deefferentation. As predicted,
compared with controls, amputees exhibited lower levels of
NAA—a putative biomarker of neuronal integrity (Moffett et
al., 2007)—in the sensorimotor hand territory located con-
tralateral to the missing hand. NAA levels were further nega-
tively associated with the time after amputation. Notably, no
such differences were detected in any of the other neurochemi-
cals that were assessed, indicating that these effects are quite
selective in nature. Below, we discuss these findings in detail,
as well as their implications and the limitations of our study.
Lower levels of NAA in the sensorimotor hand territory
contralateral to amputation are associated with time after
amputation. Consistent with our predictions, we found lower
levels of NAA in the former hand territory relative to the
analogous territory in age- and sex-matched healthy controls
(see Table 3). The lower levels of NAA reported here (by
12.8%) are of similar magnitude to MRS findings previously
reported in other central nervous system pathologies, e.g.,
stroke [by 14.2% in M1; Cirstea et al. (2011)], systemic lupus
erythematosus [by 15.9%; Sabet et al. (1998)], multiple scle-
rosis [by 12.3%; Sastre-Garriga et al. (2005)], and traumatic
brain injury [by 16.1%; Capizzano et al. (2010)]. Conse-
quently, we consider the differences in NAA levels reported in
amputees compared with controls to be reliable.
Lower levels of NAA are thought to be indicative of neu-
ronal metabolic downregulation and/or neuronal death [for
review, see Moffett et al. (2007)]. We hypothesized that one
major cue responsible for these neuronal changes is the pro-
gressive neuronal degenerative events caused by the loss of the
afferent input from and possibly a reduction in efferent output
to one hand. These reductions in activity are known to be
associated with a variety of cellular-level metabolic (i.e., ab-
normalities in mitochondrial function) and morphological (i.e.,
shrinkage in body cell size, reduction in number of synaptic
buttons, incomplete endings, loss of synapses, decreased met-
abolic activity, or even neuronal death) changes in cortical
neurons [for reviews, see Feldman and Brecht (2005) and
Holtmaat and Svoboda (2009)]. Likewise, loss of functional
inhibitory interneurons may also contribute (Ralston et al.,
1996; Welker et al., 1989). In addition, the negative relation-
ship between NAA levels and time since injury suggests that
these neuronal alterations may continue over years postampu-
tation. This is consistent with evidence indicating progressive
changes in cortical map organization years after amputation
(Qi et al., 2000) or deafferenting nerve injury (Cusick, 1996).
A number of previous studies using fMRI reported a positive
relationship between cortical reorganization in the former hand
territory and PLP (Bolognini et al., 2013; Hsu and Cohen,
2013; Moseley and Flor, 2012), while other studies found an
inverse (Makin et al., 2013) or no relationship (Makin et al.,
2015). We failed to find a significant relationship between the
intensity or duration of PLP and neuronal-level measurements
in this territory. We also failed to find a significant relationship
between the intensity of RLP and NAA levels. However, the
nature of these relationships is unclear: Do these cellular-level
changes somehow contribute to the maintenance of pain, or are
they responses to chronic nociceptive inputs to primary senso-
rimotor cortex? Obviously, more work is needed to understand
the nature of these relationships.
Thus the current NAA results support previous findings in
animal models (Feldman and Brecht, 2005; Holtmaat and
Svoboda, 2009) and humans (Freund et al., 2011; Makin et al.,
2013; Preissler et al., 2013) by revealing altered neuronal state
in the former hand territory probably resulting from deaffer-
entation-related degenerative events.
It is important to note that the differences that we detected
between amputees and controls were selective to NAA and not
evident in mIn, Glx, Cho, or Cr (Table 3). Furthermore, no
relationships were found between the secondary neurochemi-

 cals in this territory and pain ratings. This is consistent with the
hypothesis that years and even decades after hand amputation,
there is a low probability of gliosis/demyelination/inflamma-
tion/changes in brain energy homeostasis in this territory as
suggested by earlier work in hand replant recipients (Ertem et
al., 2005). Although Glx was not significantly different from
controls, we found a trend toward lower levels in the former
hand territory compared with ipsilateral territory (P � 0.05).
Therefore, we cannot rule out that subtle changes in glutama-
tergic or GABA-ergic neurotransmission may be present (Bak
et al., 2006). Because we quantified Glx, a composite of
glutamate, glutamine, GABA, and other metabolites, the sen-
sitivity of our method to detect an effect on each component of
Glx has been limited.
Despite evidence for bilateral functional changes in the
sensorimotor cortices following unilateral hand amputation
(Bogdanov et al., 2012; Elbert and Rockstroh, 2004; Elbert et
al., 1997; Frey et al., 2008), we failed to detect any evidence
for alterations in levels of NAA (and secondary neurochemi-
cals) in the ipsilateral (intact) hand territory relative to controls.
Therefore, regardless of the mechanism underlying ipsilateral
functional reorganization, the neurochemical profile is not
altered, and thus this territory could be used as a control area
in future chronic amputee 1H-MRS studies.
NAA levels in the sensorimotor hand territory contralateral
to former amputation are comparable with those in current
amputees. Contrary to our expectations that NAA levels in the
hand territory contralateral to the replanted/transplanted hand
should not differ from levels in controls, but consistent with
earlier results (Ertem et al., 2005), we found a trend of lower
NAA in former amputees. Prior functional MRI data indicate
that amputation-related reorganizational changes persist in for-
mer amputees long after hand transplantation (Frey et al.,
2008) or replantation (Eickhoff et al., 2008). The persistent
changes in NAA may echo these effects at the cellular level.
However, because of our small sample, this preliminary result
should be interpreted cautiously. Further work with larger
sample sizes is warranted.
Limitations. The current study has several limitations. The
first limitation is the borderline significance between NAA
levels in the former hand territory and phantom pain ratings (P
varied between 0.05 and 0.07) for the group of current ampu-
tees; a larger sample size would allow for more reliable results
concerning these relationships. Second, neurochemical con-
centrations depend on the brain tissue sampled. A brain tissue
volume-corrected concentration was used. Third, there were no
significant differences in brain tissue volume between groups
(Table 3). This is compatible with a recent study showing that
an artificial peripheral input may have a normalizing effect on
the sensory cortex volume (Herrera-Rincon et al., 2012). In-
deed, 79% of our current amputees regularly use prostheses to
perform daily activities. Fourth, 47% of our current amputees
were on pain medication. This could potentially alter neuro-
chemical levels, and therefore the between-group differences
could have been changed or masked. However, we do not
attribute our results to pain medication use since we did not
find a bilateral NAA alteration (as would be expected), and
NAA levels in the former hand territory of those who do not
take any kind of pain medication were significantly lower
relative to controls (Fig. 3B). Finally, the variance of time since
amputation is relatively large. Because we examined the am-
putees years and even decades after unilateral hand loss, we
have no hint from the present data of the possible time course
of NAA changes in this population.
Conclusions. In summary, we found that over years and even
decades after unilateral hand amputation, neuronal integrity is
altered in the former sensorimotor hand territory. Local
changes in NAA levels may provide a means of assessing
neuroplasticity in a deafferented cortex.
