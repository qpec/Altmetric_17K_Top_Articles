Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and 
years lived with disability for 310 diseases and injuries, 
1990–2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2015
GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators*
Background Non-fatal outcomes of disease and injury increasingly detract from the ability of the world’s population to 
live in full health, a trend largely attributable to an epidemiological transition in many countries from causes aff
 ecting 
children, to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) more common in adults. For the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we estimated the incidence, prevalence, and years lived with 
disability for diseases and injuries at the global, regional, and national scale over the period of 1990 to 2015.
Methods We estimated incidence and prevalence by age, sex, cause, year, and geography with a wide range of updated 
and standardised analytical procedures. Improvements from GBD 2013 included the addition of new data sources, 
updates to literature reviews for 85 causes, and the identifi
 cation and inclusion of additional studies published up to 
November, 2015, to expand the database used for estimation of non-fatal outcomes to 60 900 unique data sources. 
Prevalence and incidence by cause and sequelae were determined with DisMod-MR 2.1, an improved version of the 
DisMod-MR Bayesian meta-regression tool fi
 rst developed for GBD 2010 and GBD 2013. For some causes, we used 
alternative modelling strategies where the complexity of the disease was not suited to DisMod-MR 2.1 or where incidence 
and prevalence needed to be determined from other data. For GBD 2015 we created a summary indicator that combines 
measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility (the Socio-demographic Index [SDI]) and used it to 
compare observed patterns of health loss to the expected pattern for countries or locations with similar SDI scores.
Findings We generated 9·3 billion estimates from the various combinations of prevalence, incidence, and YLDs for 
causes, sequelae, and impairments by age, sex, geography, and year. In 2015, two causes had acute incidences in excess 
of 1 billion: upper respiratory infections (17·2 billion, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 15·4–19·2 billion) and diarrhoeal 
diseases (2·39 billion, 2·30–2·50 billion). Eight causes of chronic disease and injury each aff
 ected more than 10% of the 
world’s population in 2015: permanent caries, tension-type headache, iron-defi
 ciency anaemia, age-related and other 
hearing loss, migraine, genital herpes, refraction and accommodation disorders, and ascariasis. The impairment that 
aff
 ected the greatest number of people in 2015 was anaemia, with 2·36 billion (2·35–2·37 billion) individuals aff
 ected. 
The second and third leading impairments by number of individuals aff
 ected were hearing loss and vision loss, 
respectively. Between 2005 and 2015, there was little change in the leading causes of years lived with disability (YLDs) on 
a global basis. NCDs accounted for 18 of the leading 20 causes of age-standardised YLDs on a global scale. Where rates 
were decreasing, the rate of decrease for YLDs was slower than that of years of life lost (YLLs) for nearly every cause 
included in our analysis. For low SDI geographies, Group 1 causes typically accounted for 20–30% of total disability, 
largely attributable to nutritional defi
 ciencies, malaria, neglected tropical diseases, HIV
/AIDS, and tuberculosis. Lower 
back and neck pain was the leading global cause of disability in 2015 in most countries. The leading cause was sense 
organ disorders in 22 countries in Asia and Africa and one in central Latin America; diabetes in four countries in 
Oceania; HIV
/AIDS in three southern sub-Saharan African countries; collective violence and legal intervention in two 
north African and Middle Eastern countries; iron-defi
 ciency anaemia in Somalia and Venezuela; depression in Uganda; 
onchoceriasis in Liberia; and other neglected tropical diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Interpretation Ageing of the world’s population is increasing the number of people living with sequelae of diseases 
and injuries. Shifts in the epidemiological profi
 le driven by socioeconomic change also contribute to the continued 
increase in years lived with disability (YLDs) as well as the rate of increase in YLDs. Despite limitations imposed by 
gaps in data availability and the variable quality of the data available, the standardised and comprehensive approach 
of the GBD study provides opportunities to examine broad trends, compare those trends between countries or 
subnational geographies, benchmark against locations at similar stages of development, and gauge the strength or 
weakness of the estimates available.

Introduction
Although substantial progress has been made toward 
reducing mortality and extending life expectancy 
throughout the world over the past few decades, the 
epidemiological transition is manifest in the growing 
importance of non-fatal diseases, outcomes, and injuries 
which pose, partly as a consequence of decreasing death 
rates, a rising challenge to the ability of the world’s 
population to live in full health. Complementing 
information on deaths by age, sex, cause, geography, and 
time with equally detailed information on disease 
incidence, prevalence, and severity is key to a balanced 
debate in health policy. For this reason, the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) Study uses the disability-
adjusted life-year (DALY), combining years of life lost 
(YLLs) due to mortality and years lived with disability 
(YLDs) in a single metric. One DALY can be thought of 
as one lost year of healthy life. The sum of DALYs in a 
population can be thought of as the gap between the 
population’s present health status and an ideal situation 
where the entire population lives to an advanced age, 
free of disease. Assessments of how diff
 erent diseases 
lead to multimorbidity and reductions in functional 
health status are important for both health system 
planning1 and a broader range of social policy issues 
such as the appropriate age for retirement in some 
countries.2,3 Many challenges in making standardised 
estimates of non-fatal health outcomes are similar to 
those aff
 ecting mortality estimates (including variations 
in case defi
 nitions, data collection methods, variable 
quality of data collection, confl
 icting data, and missing 
data) but are compounded by more sparse and varied 
data sources, the need to characterise each disease by its 
disabling sequelae or consequence(s), and the need to 
quantify the severity of these consequences. The 
standardised approach of the annual GBD updates 
addresses these measurement problems to enhance 
comparability between causes by geography and 
over time.
The estimates from GBD 2013 drew attention to large 
increases in the number of YLDs over the previous 
decade, whereas rates of YLDs for most causes remained 
stable or showed only small decreases.4 The GBD 2013 
assessment largely attributed increases in the number 
of YLDs to musculoskeletal disorders, mental and 
substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and 
chronic respiratory diseases, as well as population growth 
and ageing. GBD 2013 also brought attention to increased 
diff
 erences in trends between mortality and morbidity 
for many causes. YLDs as a proportion of DALYs 
increased globally, a manifestation of the continuing 
epidemiological transition in low-income and middle-
income countries. Decreases in mortality from diseases 
such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, maternal and neonatal 
disorders, and an absence of progress in reducing YLD 
rates continued to drive a transition toward a greater 
global number of YLDs.
Along with broad recognition that data from some 
regions were sparse and that more and higher quality data 
in general would probably improve estimation, useful 
debates on the GBD results have been published. These 
debates have focused on the analysis or presentation of 
individual diseases, such as changes over time in GBD 
estimates of dementia,5 the accuracy of HIV incidence 
estimates,6,7 the absence of sepsis as a disease,8,9 the quality 
of some cancer registry data,10 and the absence of mental 
disorders as sequelae of neglected tropical diseases.11 The 
GBD empirical approach to measuring the public’s view of 
health state severity has generated substantial interest with 
questions about the relative importance of diff
 erent 
dimensions of health,12,13 the quantifi
 cation of health loss,14,15 
and discussions of the transferability of judgments about 
relative health to conventional notions of disability and 
dependence.5 In each cycle of the GBD, we seek to improve 
the estimates, refl
 ecting published and unpublished 
critique through the acquisition of new data, expansion of 
the network of collaborators, changes in how data are 
corrected for bias, advances in modelling techniques, and 
the targeted expansion of the GBD cause list.
The primary objective of this component of the GBD 
was to use all available data of suffi
  cient quality to 
generate reliable and valid assessments of disease and 
injury sequelae incidence, prevalence, and YLDs for all 
310 causes in the GBD cause hierarchy for 591 locations 
in the GBD study during 1990–2015. We describe the 
change over time and between populations in relation to 
where countries fall on the development continuum.16 
Continuing eff
 orts to improve data and code transparency 
are an important part of the GBD cycle. These results 
thus supersede any previous publications about the GBD 
on disease incidence, prevalence, and YLDs.
Methods
Overall approach
We estimated incidence and prevalence by age, sex, cause, 
year, and geography using a wide range of updated and 
standardised analytical procedures. The overall logic of 
our analytical approach is shown for the entire non-fatal 
estimation process in fi
 gure 1. The appendix provides a 
single source for detail of inputs, analytical processes, 
and outputs and methods specifi
 c to each cause. This 
study complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and 
Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) 
recommendations (methods appendix pp 1, 608–10).17
Geographies in GBD 2015
The geographies included in GBD 2015 have been 
arranged into a set of hierarchical categories composed of 
seven super-regions and a further nested set of 21 regions 
containing 195 countries and territories. Eight additional 
subnational assessments were done for Brazil, China, 
India, Japan, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sweden, 
and the USA (methods appendix pp 611–24). For this 
study we present data at the national and territory level.

List of causes and sequelae
The GBD cause and sequelae list is organised 
hierarchically (methods appendix 625–53). At Level 1 
there are three cause groups: communicable, maternal, 
neonatal, and nutritional diseases (Group 1 diseases); 
non-communicable diseases; and injuries. These Level 1 
aggregates are subdivided at Level 2 of the hierarchy into 
21 cause groupings. The disaggregation into Levels 3 
and 4 contains the fi
 nest level of detail for causes 
captured in GBD 2015. Sequelae of diseases and injuries 
are organised at Levels 5 and 6 of the hierarchy. The 
fi
 nest detail for all sequelae estimated in GBD is at 
Level 6 and is aggregated into summary sequelae 
categories (Level 5) for causes with large numbers of 
sequelae. Sequelae in GBD are mutually exclusive and 
collectively exhaustive, and thus our YLD estimates at 
each level of the hierarchy sum to the total of the level 
above. Prevalence aggregations are estimated at the level 
of individuals who might have more than one sequela or 
disease and therefore are not additive.
The cause and sequelae list was expanded based upon 
 
feedback after the release of GBD 2013 and input from 
GBD 2015 collaborators. Nine causes for which 
non-fatal outcomes are estimated were added: Ebola 
virus disease, motor-neuron disease, environmental 
heat and cold exposure, four subtypes of leukaemia, 
and two subtypes of non-melanoma skin cancer 
(methods appendix pp 625–53). The incorporation of 
these changes expanded the cause list from the 
301 causes with non-fatal estimates examined in 
GBD 2013, to 310 causes with non-fatal estimates and 
from 2337 to 2619 unique sequelae at Level 6 of the 
hierarchy. At the newly created Level 5 of the hierarchy 
there were 154 summary sequela categories. The 
methods appendix (pp 654–61) provides a list of 
International Classifi
 cation of Diseases version 9 
(ICD-9) and version 10 (ICD-10) codes used in the 
extraction of hospital and claims data, mapped to GBD 
2015 non-fatal causes, impairments, and nature of 
injury categories.

Period of analysis
A complete set of age-specifi
 c, sex-specifi
 c, cause-
specifi
 c, and geography-specifi
 c incidence and prevalence 
numbers and rates were computed for the years 1990, 
1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. In this study we focus 
on trends for main and national results over the past 
decade, from 2005 to 2015, together with more detailed 
results for 2015. Online data visualisations at vizhub 
provide access to results for all GBD metrics.
Non-fatal modelling strategies vary substantially 
between causes. Figure 1 outlines the general process of 
non-fatal outcome estimation from data inputs to 
fi
 nalisation of YLD burden results; step 3b of that process 
identifi
 es alternative modelling approaches used for 
specifi
 c causes (methods appendix pp 603, 604). The 
starting point for non-fatal estimation is the compilation 
of data sources identifi
 ed through systematic analysis 
and extractions based on predetermined inclusion and 
exclusion criteria (methods appendix p 603). As part of 
the inclusion criteria, we defi
 ned disease-specifi
 c or 
injury-specifi
 c reference case defi
 nitions and study 
methods, as well as alternative allowable case defi
 nitions 
and study methods which were adjusted for if we detected 
a systematic bias. We used 15 types of primary data 
sources representing disease prevalence, incidence, 
mortality risk, duration, remission, or severity in the 
estimation process (oval shapes in fi
 gure 1).
Data sources
For this iteration of the study, we updated data searches 
through systematic data and literature reviews for 
85 causes published up to Oct 31, 2015. For other 
causes, input from GBD collaborators resulted in 
the identifi
 cation and inclusion of a small number of 
additional studies published after January, 2013. Data were 
systematically screened from household surveys archived 
in the Global Health Data Exchange, sources suggested 
to us by in-country experts, and surveys identifi
 ed in 
major multinational survey data catalogues and Ministry 
of Health and Central Statistical Offi
  ce websites. Case 
notifi
 cations reported to WHO were updated up to and 
including 2015. Citations for all data sources used for non-
fatal estimation in GBD 2015 are provided in searchable 
form through a new web tool. A description of the 
search terms used for cause-specifi
 c systematic reviews, 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the preferred and 
alternative case defi
 nitions and study methods are detailed 
by cause in the methods appendix (pp 26–601).
Hospital 
inpatient 
data 
were 
extracted 
from 
284 country-year and 976 subnational-year combinations 
from 27 countries in North America, Latin America, 
Europe, and New Zealand. Outpatient encounter data 
were available from the USA, Norway, Sweden, and 
Canada for 48 country-years. For GBD 2015, we also 
accessed aggregate data derived from claims information 
in a database of US private and public insurance schemes 
for the years 2000, 2010, and 2012. From the linked 
claims data, we generated several correction factors to 
account for bias in health service encounter data from 
elsewhere, which were largely available to us aggregated 
by ICD code and by primary diagnosis only. First, for 
chronic disorders, we estimated the ratio between 
prevalence from primary diagnoses and prevalence from 
all diagnoses associated with a claim. Second, we used 
the claims data to generate the average number of 
outpatient visits per disorder. Similarly, we generated per 
person discharge rates from hospital inpatient data in the 
USA and New Zealand, the only sources with unique 
patient identifi
 ers available for GBD 2015.
In GBD 2013, we calculated a geographical and temporal 
data representativeness index (DRI) of non-fatal data 
sources for each cause or impairment. The DRI represents 
the fraction of countries for which any incidence, 
prevalence, remission, or mortality risk data were available 
for a cause. This metric quantifi
 es data availability, not 
data quality. The overall DRI and period-specifi
 c DRI 
measures for each cause and impairment are presented in 
the methods appendix (pp 662–68). DRI ranged from 90% 
for nine causes, including tuberculosis and measles, to 
less than 5% for acute hepatitis C and the category of 
other exposures to mechanical forces. Required case 
reporting resulted in high DRI values for notifi
 able 
infectious diseases; the network of population-based 
registries for cancers resulted in a DRI of above 50%. 
DRI values ranged from 6·1% in North Korea to 91·3% 
in the USA. Many high-income countries, as well as 
Brazil, India, and China, had DRI values above 63%; data 
availability was low in several countries, including 
Equatorial Guinea, Djibouti, and South Sudan.
Non-fatal disease models
In addition to the corrections applied to claims and 
hospital data, a number of other adjustments were applied 
including age–sex splitting, bias correction, adjustments 
for under-reporting of notifi
 cation data, and computing 
expected values of excess mortality. In GBD 2013, we 
estimated expected values of excess mortality from 
prevalence or incidence and cause-specifi
 c mortality 
rate data for a few causes only, including tuberculosis 
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In order to 
achieve greater consistency between our cause of death 
and non-fatal data, we adopted this strategy systematically 
for GBD 2015. We matched every prevalence data point 
(or incidence datapoint for short duration disorders) with 
the cause-specifi
 c mortality rate value corresponding to 
the age range, sex, year, and location of the datapoint. 
The ratio of cause-specifi
 c mortality rate to prevalence is 
conceptually equivalent to an excess mortality rate.
To estimate non-fatal health outcomes in previous 
iterations of GBD, most diseases and impairments were 
modelled in DisMod-MR, a Bayesian meta-regression tool 
originally developed for GBD 2010 (step 3a in fi
 gure 1).18 
DisMod-MR was designed to address statistical challenges 
in estimation of non-fatal health outcomes, and for

synthesis of often sparse and heterogeneous epidemio-
logical data. For GBD 2015, the computational engine of 
DisMod-MR 2.1 remained unchanged, but we substantially 
rewrote the code that organises the fl
 ow of data and 
settings at each level of the analytical cascade. The 
sequence of estimation occurs at fi
 ve levels: global, super-
region, region, country, and where applicable, subnational 
locations (appendix pp 611–24). At each level of the cascade, 
the DisMod-MR 2.1 computational engine enforces 
consistency between all disease parameters. For GBD 2015, 
we generated fi
 ts for the years 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 
and 2015. We log-linearly interpolated estimates for the 
intervening years in each 5-year period. Greater detail on 
DisMod-MR 2.1 is available at Global Health Data 
Exchange and the methods appendix (pp 7–11).
In previous iterations of GBD, custom models were 
created for a short list of causes for which the compartment 
model underpinning DisMod (susceptible, diseased, and 
dead) was insuffi
  cient to capture the complexity of the 
disease or for which incidence and prevalence needed to 
be derived from other data. Step 3b of fi
 gure 1 describes 
the development of custom models with greater detail 
shown in the methods appendix fi
 gure 1B (p 604, and 
for associated write-ups pp 26–601) for HIV
/AIDS, 
tuberculosis, 
malaria, 
cancer, 
neonatal 
disorders, 
infectious diseases for which we derived incidence from 
seroprevalence data, and infectious diseases for which we 
derived incidence from cause of death rates and pooled 
estimates of the case fatality proportion.
In GBD 2013, we estimated the country–age–sex–year 
prevalence of nine impairments (step 4 of fi
 gure 1). 
Impairments in GBD are disorders or specifi
 c domains of 
functional health loss that are spread across many GBD 
causes as sequelae and for which there are better data to 
estimate the occurrence of the overall impairment than for 
each sequela based on the underlying cause. Overall 
impairment prevalence was estimated with DisMod-MR 2.1 
except for anaemia, for which spatiotemporal Gaussian 
Process regression methods were applied. We constrained 
cause-specifi
 c estimates of impairments, such as in the 
19 causes of blindness, to sum to the total prevalence 
estimated for that impairment. Anaemia, epilepsy, hearing 
loss, heart failure, and intellectual disability were estimated 
at diff
 erent levels of severity.
Severity distributions
In step 5, sequelae were further defined in terms 
of severity for 194 causes at Level 4 of the hierarchy 
(fi
 gure 1A). We generally followed the same approach for 
estimating the distribution of severity as in GBD 2013. 
For Ebola virus disease, we created a health state for the 
infectious disease episode with duration derived from 
average hospital admission times, and a health state for 
ongoing postinfection malaise and joint problems based 
on four follow-up studies19–22 from which we derived an 
average duration. The health states for the subtypes of 
leukaemia and non-melanoma skin cancer were the 
same as the general cancer health states. For motor-
neuron disease we accessed the Pooled Resource Open-
Access ALS Clinical Trials (PROACT) database containing 
detailed information on symptoms and impairments for 
more than 8500 patients who took part in the trials.23
Disability weights  
We used the same disability weights as in GBD 2013 (see 
methods appendix pp 669–94 for a complete listing of 
the lay descriptions and values for the 235 health states 
used in GBD 2015).
Comorbidity
In step 7, we estimated the co-occurrence of diff
 erent 
diseases by simulating 40 000 individuals in each 
geography–age–sex–year combination as exposed to the 
independent probability of having any of the sequelae 
included in GBD 2015 based on disease prevalence. We 
tested the contribution of dependent and independent 
comorbidity in the US Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys 
(MEPS) data, and found that independent comorbidity 
was the dominant factor even though there are well 
known examples of dependent comorbidity. Age was 
the main predictor of comorbidity such that age-specifi
 c 
microsimulations accommodated most of the required 
comorbidity correction. Taking dependent comorbidity 
into account changed the overall YLDs estimated in the 
MEPS data by only 2·5% (and ranging from 0·6% to 
3·4% depending on age) in comparison to assuming 
independent comorbidity (methods appendix pp 18–20).24
YLD computation
We report 95% uncertainty intervals (95% UI) for each 
quantity in this analysis using 1000 samples from the 
posterior distribution of prevalence and 1000 samples of 
the disability weight to generate 1000 samples of the YLD 
distribution. The 95% UI is reported as the 25th and 975th 
values of the distribution. We report signifi
 cant changes 
in disease estimates between countries or over time if the 
change was noted in more than 950 of the 1000 samples 
computed for each result. For GBD 2015, we computed 
age-standardised prevalence YLD rates from the updated 
world population age standard developed for GBD 2013.25 
Less common diseases and their sequelae were included 
in 35 residual categories (methods appendix pp 695–97). 
For 22 of these residual categories, estimates were made 
from epidemiological data for incidence or prevalence. 
For 13 residual categories, we estimated YLDs by 
multiplying the residual YLL estimates by the ratio of 
YLDs to YLLs from the estimates for explicitly modelled 
Level 3 causes in the same disease category.
Socio-demographic Index
In GBD 2013, a sociodemographic status variable 
 
 
was computed based on a principal components 
analysis of income per capita, educational attainment, 
average age of the population, and the total fertility

rate.26 For GBD 2015, we excluded mean age of the 
population because it is directly aff
 ected by death 
rates. To improve interpretability for GBD 2015, we 
computed a Socio-demographic Index (SDI) similar to 
the computation of the human development index.27 
In the SDI, each component was weighted equally and 
rescaled from zero (for the lowest value observed during 
1980–2015) to one (for the highest value observed) for 
income per capita and average years of schooling, and 
the reverse for the total fertility rate. The fi
 nal SDI score 
was computed as the geometric mean of each of the 
components. SDI ranged from 0·060 in Mozambique in 
1987 to 0·978 in District of Columbia, USA, in 2015.

Results
Global incidence and prevalence
We generated over 9·3 billion outcomes of incidence, 
prevalence, and YLDs for 310 diseases, injuries, and 
aggregate categories; 2619 unique and aggregate 
sequelae; nine impairments; 63 age–sex groups; 
591 geographies; and 26 individual years from 1990 
to 2015. Each of these 9·3 billion estimates was 
calculated 1000 times to determine uncertainty 
intervals. Here, we present key summary fi
 ndings 
on global incidence of short duration diseases, global 
prevalence of long-term disorders, global prevalence 
of impairments, global numbers and rates of YLDs 
and changes from 2005 to 2015, global YLL and YLD 
rates of change, patterns of comorbidity, the expected 
changes in the composition of YLDs with SDI, and 
country fi
 ndings of leading causes of YLDs.
Disorders of less than 3 months duration and injuries 
with incidence of more than 1 million cases per year in 
2015 are listed in table 1. There were two disorders with 
incidence greater than 1 billion per year: upper respiratory 
infections (17·2 billion [95% UI 15·4–19·2 billion]), and 
diarrhoeal diseases (2·39 billion [2·30–2·50 billion]). 
A further 13 diseases and injuries caused between 
100 million and 1 billion incident cases a year 
and 16 diseases and injuries had incident cases of 
between 10 million and 100 million per year (table 1).
The disease and injury sequelae with a duration of 
more than 3 months and a global prevalence of more 
than 1% in 2015 are presented in table 2, aggregated to 
the cause level. Prevalence for impairments is presented 
at the bottom of table 3. Eight out of 56 high-prevalence 
causes aff
 ected more than 10% of the world’s population 
in 2015. A further 48 causes aff
 ected between 1% and 
10% of the world’s population (table 2). Although many of

these causes are not among the dominant causes of YLDs 
because of comparatively low average disability weights, 
some causes, such as headaches, gynaecological diseases, 
oral disorders, and skin diseases, put great demands on 
health system resources by their sheer numbers.
Anaemia was the most common of our nine 
impairments, aff
 ecting 2·36 billion (2·35–2·37 billion) 
people in 2015. The next most common impairments 
were hearing loss of greater than 20 dB (1·33 billion 
[1·26–1·40 
billion]), 
vision 
loss 
(940 
million 
[905–974 million]), developmental intellectual disability 
(153 million [114–191 million]), infertility (113 million 
[93·4–136 
million]), 
heart 
failure 
(40·0 
million 
[38·6–41·4 million]), and epilepsy (39·2 million 
[34·3–43·7 million]; table 3; see results appendix 
(pp 740–48) for the prevalence estimates of the underlying 
causes of these impairments). Iron defi
 ciency was the 
cause of anaemia in more than half of all cases. Over 
90% of hearing loss was classifi
 ed as age-related or other 
hearing loss. The largest number of people with vision 
loss had uncorrected refraction error. Idiopathic 
developmental intellectual disability, idiopathic female 
infertility, and idiopathic epilepsy were the most common 
causes of their impairments. Ischaemic heart disease 
was the most common cause of heart failure.
Global causes of disability 
Global trends in YLDs 2005 to 2015
GBD 2015 included the assessment of 2619 sequelae at 
Level 6 of the GBD cause hierarchy, including 1316 sequelae 
from injuries that contributed to the global burden of 
disability. Causes at Level 4 of the hierarchy that resulted in 
30 million or more YLDs in 2015 included lower back pain, 
major depressive disorder, age-related and other hearing 
loss, and neck pain. Figure 2 compares the leading causes 
of global YLDs in 2005 and 2015, using the cause 
breakdowns at Level 3 of the GBD cause hierarchy. Among 
the ten leading causes of YLDs, iron-defi
 ciency anaemia 
and depressive disorders switched ranks to positions three 
and four respectively, diabetes rose from the eighth to the 
sixth position, migraine dropped from position six to 
seven, and other musculoskeletal disorders dropped from 
rank seven to eight (fi
 gure 2).
Estimates of prevalence and YLDs at the global level for 
2005 and 2015 for each cause are presented in table 3 (see 
results appendix pp 717–40 for full detail at the sequelae 
level). Prevalence and age-standardised YLDs for 
21 Group 1 diseases decreased signifi
 cantly and by more 
than 10%, including measles, African trypanosomiasis, 
diphtheria, lymphatic fi
 lariasis, and rabies.
Age-standardised YLD rates for all maternal causes and 
sequelae combined decreased between 2005 and 2015, 
whereas overall age-standardised YLDs for neonatal 
disorders increased by 3·11% (–0·32–6·79%) since 2005 to 
144 YLDs per 100 000 (109–185 YLDs per 100 000) in 2015, 
and age-standardised YLD rates decreased and absolute 
numbers of cases increased for nutritional defi
 ciencies. 
Age-standardised YLD rates attributable to hepatitis A, B, 
and C increased, and decreased for hepatitis E. The number 
of individuals with chronic hepatitis C infection increased 
from 121 million (108–133 million) in 2005 to 142 million 
(127–157 million) in 2015.
Changes in age-standardised YLDs and YLLs over time
In 2005, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) accounted 
for 23 of the leading 25 causes of age-standardised YLDs 
worldwide and 23 of the 25 leading causes in 2015 
(fi
 gure 2). Although diabetes rose only two ranks in the 
list of leading cause of YLDs, from position eight to six 
between 2005 and 2015, the increase in age-standardised 
rate was 5·4% (3·2–7·5%). Musculoskeletal disorders 
occupied three of the leading 25 causes of disability in 
both 2005 and 2015; lower back and neck pain were the 
single largest cause with little change in their rates.

However, age-standardised rates of YLDs increased for 
osteoarthritis 3·90% (3·00–4·83%) by 2015. Depressive 
disorders were the fourth leading cause of disability in 
2005 and the third leading cause of disability in 2015, 
and age-standardised YLD rates associated with the 
disorder 
increased 
marginally 
(1·0% 
[0·5–1·5%]). 
Age-standardised rates of YLDs from alcohol use disorders 
decreased after 2005 (4·5% [2·3–6·4%]) whereas disability 
due to drug use disorders increased by 8·2% (6·2–10·2%).
In contrast with global trends for NCDs, both relative 
ranks and age-standardised YLD rates decreased for 
most injuries. Falls, which were the 13th leading cause 
of disability in 2005, dropped to the 15th rank, 
and age-standardised YLD rates decreased (8·58% 
[5·23–12·2%]). Other unintentional injuries decreased 
in global rank from 27th in 2005 to 34th in 2015, 
and age-standardiSed YLD rates decreased by 16·7% 
(15·7–17·9%).
The leading causes of disability varied considerably with 
age (fi
 gure 3). The leading cause in children younger than 
5 years was iron-defi
 ciency anaemia followed by skin 
diseases, protein-energy malnutrition, and diarrhoea. In 
older children, iron-defi
 ciency anaemia, skin diseases, 
asthma, and mental health disorders such as conduct, 
autistic spectrum, and anxiety disorders were top ten 
causes of disability. In adolescents and young adults (aged 
between 15 and 39 years), iron-defi
 ciency anaemia, skin 
diseases, depression, lower back and neck pain, and 
migraine led the rankings. Other mental health disorders 
such as anxiety disorders and schizophrenia were in the 
top ten causes in this age group. In middle-aged adults, 
musculoskeletal disorders dominated the top rankings 
followed by mental health disorders, especially depression. 
Diabetes and sense organ disorders were more prominent 
causes of disability in middle-age. In older adults (older 
than 65 years), sense organ disorders were the top-ranked 
cause of disability. Musculoskeletal disorders remained a 
dominant source of disability, and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease entered the top ten. In the oldest age 
groups, ischaemic heart disease and Alzheimer’s and 
other dementias made their fi
 rst appearance in the top ten.
We examined the trends in YLDs and YLLs in a 
scatterplot (fi
 gure 4). YLLs decreased for the majority of 
causes. For Group 1 causes and injuries, the decrease in 
YLLs was accompanied by a decrease in YLDs, albeit at a 
slower pace. The exceptions were neonatal encephalopathy, 
haemolytic 
disease 
and 
other 
neonatal 
jaundice, 
leishmaniasis, meningitis, hepatitis, and sexually trans-
mitted diseases with increasing YLD rates between 1990 
and 2015. A few Group 1 disorders and injuries had a 
faster decrease in YLDs than in YLLs: intestinal infections, 
obstructed labour, and neonatal sepsis. The only NCDs 
with a faster decrease in YLDs compared with YLLs were 
epilepsy and cervical cancer. Another small number of 
NCDs saw an increase in YLDs and YLLs, including drug 
use disorders, diabetes, and Parkinson’s disease. NCDs 
with decreasing YLLs but increasing YLDs included

cancers of the prostate, testis, uterus, kidney, colorectum, 
and pancreas, melanoma, and congenital disorders. Some 
cancers (stomach and Hodgkin’s lymphoma), rheumatic 
heart disease, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, acute glomerulonephritis, peptic ulcer disease, 
gastritis, hernia, and gallbladder disease had decreasing 
YLLs and YLDs, but with a faster decrease in YLLs than in 
YLDs. The rate of change in YLDs for the main drivers of 
non-fatal health loss, musculoskeletal disorders, and 
mental and substance use disorders was small.
Global distribution of disability weights across individuals
Figure 5 shows the global distribution of individuals from 
our comorbidity microsimulation by six categories of 
disability, age, and sex for the highest and lowest SDI 
quintile. The six categories of disability are no disability, 
very mild disability (disability weight less than or equal to 
0·01), mild disability (from 0·01 to 0·05 inclusive), 
moderate (from 0·05 to 0·1 inclusive), severe (from 0·1 to 
0·3 inclusive), and profound (greater than 0·3). In 2015, 
most of the world’s population experienced mild or 
greater disability. Having no disability at all was most 
common in children. After age 25 years, the proportion of 
the population having no disability became progressively 
smaller, and by age 55 years in low SDI countries and age 
75 years in high SDI countries, nearly everyone had some 
form of disability. Very mild to moderate disability (ie, 
individuals with a disability weight of 0·1 or less) was 
common in childhood and young adults, but was replaced 
by more severe disability with increasing age. The 
patterns were similar for both sexes, apart from a much 
larger amount of disability in women older than 80 years 
in the top SDI quintiles, refl
 ecting the much higher 
average age of women in this age category. For policy 
considerations around the age of retirement in ageing 
populations, it is noteworthy that from age 60 years 
onwards more than half of the population had severe or 
worse disability. The extent to which this loss of health 
limits or precludes the ability to work depends on the 
nature of the impairments and the type of employment in 
older workers with that level of disability.
Expected changes in disease profi
 le with higher 
Socio-demographic Index
Figure 6 depicts changes in patterns of disability by level of 
SDI for age-standardised and all-age YLD rates per 100 000. 
Age-standardised YLD rates gradually decreased with 
increasing SDI in both sexes (fi
 gure 6A). The cause 
composition of YLDs somewhat varied across levels of 
SDI; these diff
 erences were largely derived from absolute 
levels of disability due to communicable causes and 
nutritional defi
 ciencies, and to a lesser extent, maternal 
and neonatal disorders. Age-standardised YLD rates due to 
NCDs and injuries were similar at all SDI levels.
Across levels of SDI, mental and substance use 
disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and other NCDs 
were consistently among the leading causes of

age-standardised YLD rates. Anaemia led to generally 
higher rates of age-standardised YLDs in women than in 
men across levels of SDI, but the largest imbalance 
occurred at SDI levels between 0·10 and 0·50. Disability 
from injuries exacted a larger burden for men than for 
women, particularly at lower levels of SDI.
Without adjustments for population age structure 
(fi
 gure 6B), the eff
 ect of ageing populations and causes 
of disability that disproportionately aff
 ect older 
individuals become prominent. At all levels of SDI, 
total YLDs per 100 000 did not notably diff
 er by sex; 
instead, the cause composition of disability showed 
greater diff
 erences. Below an SDI score of 0·25, 
communicable causes accounted for 30–45% of total 
disability, primarily due to nutritional defi
 ciencies, 
malaria, and neglected tropical diseases. YLDs 
per 
100 000 
due 
to 
musculoskeletal 
disorders, 
particularly lower back and neck pain and other mus-
culo 
skeletal disorders, increased substantially from low 
to high SDI, with a more pronounced increase 
beginning at an SDI score of 0·6. This rise was 
particularly evident in women.
Trends in age-standardised YLDs per capita 
Globally, age-standardised YLDs per capita (an indicator 
of overall disability experienced per person in a given 
place) moderately decreased for both sexes between 1990 
and 2015 (results appendix pp 714–16). Age-standardised 
YLDs per capita were consistently higher for women 
than for men at the global level. For both sexes, YLDs 
per capita were generally higher for lower levels of SDI. 
YLDs per capita were noticeably larger for low SDI and 
low-middle SDI groups than for other SDI levels (ie, 
high SDI, high-middle SDI, and middle SDI), which 
were more similar to each other. 
Leading causes of YLDs and deviations from expected levels 
based on Socio-demographic Index
Clear, though varied, patterns emerged across and within 
GBD regions in comparison of observed levels of YLDs 
due to leading causes of disability with levels expected on 
the basis of SDI. Figure 7 displays ratios of observed and 
expected YLDs for the leading ten causes at level 3 of the 
GBD hierarchy in 2015, colour coded by the magnitude 
of diff
 erences between observed and expected YLDs.
Globally, lower back and neck pain was the leading 
cause of disability in 2015. Two mental disorders, major 
depressive and anxiety disorders, were the third and 
ninth leading causes of global disability, and diabetes was 
the sixth leading driver of disability. Iron-defi
 ciency 
anaemia was the only Group 1 cause among the leading 
ten causes for global YLDs (ranked fourth). Sensory 
disorders ranked second and skin diseases ranked fi
 fth. 
Lower back and neck pain was the leading global cause of 
disability in 2015 in most countries. The leading cause of 
disability in 2015 was iron-defi
 ciency anaemia in 
27 countries; HIV
/AIDS in all six southern sub-Saharan 
African countries; depression in fi
 ve eastern sub-Saharan 
Africa countries; other neglected tropical diseases in 
Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Gabon; 
sense organ disorders in Comoros and Myanmar; 
diabetes in Fiji and Marshall Islands; war in Lebanon and 
Syria; and onchocerciasis in Liberia.
Regional, country, territory, and selected subnational results
Lower back and neck pain was the leading cause of 
disability in all high-income countries in 2015. However, 
ratios of observed to expected YLDs from lower back and 
neck pain ranged from 0·60 for Singapore to more than 
1·59 in Norway. Most high-income countries experienced 
higher than expected levels of disability due to depressive 
disorders. The USA and Australia were the only two high-
income countries where drug use disorders were a top ten 
cause of disability, and observed levels of YLDs were much 
higher than expected. South Korea’s ratio of observed-to-
expected levels of YLDs due to diabetes exceeded 1·30, 
whereas Japan’s diabetes-related disability was lower than 
expected on the basis of SDI. In the UK, observed disability 
due to asthma was well above expected levels.
In 2015, lower back and neck pain was the leading 
cause of YLDs for all but two countries in Latin America 
and the Caribbean; Haiti and Venezuela were the 
exceptions, with iron-defi
 ciency anaemia as the leading 
causes of disability for both countries. Disability due to 
diabetes surpassed expected levels by at least a factor of 
two for six countries and territories: Antigua, Barbados, 
Dominica, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago, and the 
Virgin Islands. Peru, however, had a ratio of less than 0·6 
for observed and expected YLDs for diabetes. 
In 2015, lower back and neck pain was the leading 
cause of YLDs for 24 out of 28 countries and territories of 
southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania. Other leading 
causes of disability were sensory disorders in Myanmar, 
diabetes in Fiji and the Marshall Islands, and 
iron-defi
 ciency anaemia in Papua New Guinea. Although 
lower back and neck pain was the primary cause of 
disability, many countries had far lower levels of this 
than expected given their SDI, including Thailand (0·73), 
Indonesia (0·76), and Malaysia (0·75). Observed YLDs 
due to depressive disorders were often lower than 
expected, with 22 countries recording ratios below 0·80. 
Conversely, numerous geographies recorded YLD ratios 
exceeding 2·00 for diabetes (eg, 2·29 in Taiwan). 
Beyond lower back and neck pain, which was the leading 
cause of YLDs for three of fi
 ve countries in south Asia  in 
2015 (with India and Pakistan being the exception), a 
mixture of causes accounted for the region’s main causes 
of disability; this heterogeneity probably refl
 ects the 
diversity of countries in the region and their places along 
the development spectrum. Iron-defi
 ciency anaemia was 
the fi
 rst leading cause and lower back and neck pain was 
the second leading cause of YLDs in both India and 
Pakistan, whereas sensory disorders, other musculoskeletal 
disorders, and iron-defi
 ciency anaemia ranked second for

disability in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan, respectively. 
YLDs due to anxiety were lower than expected in all 
countries in the region except for Bangladesh.
In the GBD super-region of central Europe, eastern 
Europe, and central Asia, lower back and neck pain was the 
leading cause of disability in every geographical region in 
2015; Although all countries in eastern and central Europe 
recorded higher than expected YLD ratios for most of their 
top ten causes, central Asia mostly had lower than expected 
or as expected YLD ratios. Sense organ diseases were the 
second leading causes of disability and depressive disorders 
were the third leading causes in this super-region.
Sizeable discrepancies occurred for observed and 
expected YLDs based on SDI throughout north Africa 
and the Middle East, probably refl
 ecting the uneven 
achievements in development found in this region. 
Lower back and neck pain was the primary driver of 
YLDs in the region. Exceptions to this were Lebanon and 
Syria, for which war caused the most disability in 2015, 
and Afghanistan for which iron-defi
 ciency was the 
leading cause. Depression, sense organ diseases, diabetes 
ranked second, third, and fourth, respectively, for the 
region. Observed YLDs due to diabetes consistently 
exceeded expected levels, with two countries posting 
ratios higher than 3·00 (ie, Qatar [3·12], and the United 
Arab Emirates [3·52]). Iran and Morocco recorded much 
higher disability due to drug use disorders than expected 
based on SDI.
In comparison with the rest of the world, ranks of cause-
specifi
 c disability, and their ratios of observed to expected 
values, were vastly diff
 erent in sub-Saharan Africa. Of the 
46 countries within the super-regions, nine had lower back 
and neck pain as the leading cause of YLDs in 2015. In 
southern Sub-Saharan Africa, HIV
/AIDS was the leading 
cause of disability for all countries. Iron-defi
 ciency anaemia 
ranked as the leading cause of YLDs for 11 countries in 
western sub-Saharan Africa. For the remaining countries, 
lower back and neck pain were primarily the leading cause 
of YLDs; Liberia, the exception, had onchocerciasis as its 
leading cause of disability. Malaria and various neglected 
tropical diseases caused more YLDs than expected in most 
west African countries. For eastern sub-Saharan Africa, 
sense organ diseases, iron defi
 ciency, depressive disorders, 
and lower back and neck pain were leading causes of YLDs

in 2015. In central sub-Saharan Africa, skin diseases were 
consistently among the leading three-to-four causes of 
disability in this region. HIV
/AIDS resulted in far more 
YLDs than expected based on SDI, with Equatorial Guinea, 
and Central African Republic recording ratios of observed 
versus expected YLDs higher than 2·00.
Discussion
We used 60 900 data sources to estimate the incidence 
and prevalence of 2619 sequelae of 310 causes for 
591 geographical regions for the years 1990, 1995, 2000, 
2005, 2010, and 2015. After accounting for variation over 
time and across regions in case defi
 nitions, disease assays, 
survey instruments, and coding practice, and using 
standardised modelling approaches to deal with missing 
data, confl
 icting data, and a range of sampling and non-
sampling errors, we characterised the global and national 
patterns in non-fatal health outcomes. We found that global 
age-standardised YLDs per capita decreased slightly in the 
last 25 years from 0·114 (0·085–0·147) in 1990 to 0·110 
(0·082–0·141) per capita in 2015, a total decrease of 3·69% 
(3·12–4·25%) over a generation (appendix pp 714–16). The 
ageing of the world’s population and the general increase 
in YLDs per capita with age resulted in an increase in 
global YLDs per capita. Within this overall pattern, 133 out 
of 310 causes had statistically signifi
 cant decreases in YLDs 
per capita between 2005 and 2015 compared with 82 causes 
with statistically signifi
 cant increases in YLDs per capita 
over the same time period. The most important 
contributors to global YLDs were musculoskeletal disorders 
(18·5% [16·4–20·9%] of all YLDs in 2015), mental and 
substance use disorders (18·4% [15·6–21·2%]), and the 
category of other NCDs (17·9% [15·0–21·7%]), dominated 
by hearing loss, vision loss, and skin diseases. 
Typology of diseases based on YLDs and YLLs
The comparison of trends in age-standardised YLDs and 
YLLs provides insight into the drivers of diff
 erences in 
rates of increases and decreases for diseases and injuries. 
Diseases and injuries can be parsed into four groups. The 
fi
 rst of these are a small set of disorders including causes 
such as drug use disorders and skin cancer for which age-
standardised rates of both YLDs and YLLs increased at a 
rate of more than 0·4% per year from 2005 to 2015. 
A second category of diseases includes those in which 
YLDs are increasing but YLLs are decreasing, including 
disorders such as thyroid cancer, cirrhosis, and neonatal 
encephalopathy. One explanation for this pattern is that 
risk factors, broadly defi
 ned, are causing an increase in 
incidence, whereas access to eff
 ective treatment has 
improved enough to continue reducing mortality. For a 
third category of disorders, YLDs are essentially constant, 
but YLLs are decreasing. This grouping is quite large and 
includes many of the major causes of disability such as 
musculoskeletal disorders, various neurological disorders, 
and a number of cancers. For many infectious causes, 
decreased are occurring for both YLLs and YLDs but are 
much faster for YLLs; this pattern is to be expected if access 
to eff
 ective treatment is decreasing the number of deaths 
but not reducing prevalence or incidence. The last category 
includes disorders where decreases are equal, if not slightly 
higher, for YLDs including ischaemic heart disease, falls, 
cervical cancer, and other injuries. Examination of 
diff
 erential trends by region or country might provide 
insights into the role of access to treatment in reducing 
YLLs and, conversely, the role of increasing or decreasing 
risks and social determinants in driving changes in disease 
incidence and prevalence. More detailed exploration of 
these diff
 erential trends is warranted in future work.
Disability and retirement age
As life expectancy has steadily increased in most countries, 
there have been calls in some high SDI countries to extend 
retirement ages to refl
 ect these changes in survival.28–30 
A crucial factor in these debates is whether individuals are 
living for longer and have higher average levels of 
functional health at each age or not. In this study, we 
found that age-standardised YLDs per capita decreased, 
but rather slowly, over the period 2005 to 2015. Comparison 
of trends in age-standardised YLDs and YLLs by cause 
shows that the main causes of YLDs are not decreasing 
and in some settings might be increasing. Other than a 
somewhat slower rate of improvement for YLDs at oldest 
age (≥80 years), age discontinuities are not observable in 
these patterns. Ultimately, the debate on retirement age 
will hinge on the skill sets required for diff
 erent types 
of work, whether work contributes to diminished 
or improved functional health status, and societal 
expectations for retirement. Our fi
 ndings suggest that the 
burden from mental and substance use disorders, and 
musculoskeletal disorders, which are frequent causes of 
early retirement31,32 in terms of age-specifi
 c prevalence, has 
not declined much over time; the continued prevalence of 
these and other disorders associated with increasing age 
might limit the capacities of an older workforce. 
Epidemiological transition 
The analysis of YLD rates by Level 2 causes as a function of 
SDI shows a very diff
 erent picture than that reported for 
YLLs. At the lower end of the SDI spectrum, incremental 
increases in SDI are associated with reductions in both 
age-standardised YLDs and all-age YLD rates spurred by 
decreases in disability from neglected tropical diseases and 
anaemia as well as decreases in tuberculosis, diarrhoea, 
pneumonia, meningitis, and other infectious diseases. 
At SDI levels above 0·8 (see methods appendix pp 698–711 
for SDI values for each country), age-standardised rates of 
health loss increase slightly, attributable to higher rates of 
mental and substance use disorders, musculoskeletal 
disorders, and neurological disorders. In this phase of the 
epidemiological transition, this increase in rates, although 
small, combined with population ageing, results in 
increases in YLDs per 100 000. The rising average YLD per 
capita rates have implications for health systems; a larger

fraction of the population is likely to need care for many 
disorders. Some of these disorders are currently costly to 
manage.33 The increase in health-care costs per individual 
in the population that occurs once an SDI of 0·8 is exceeded 
is a predictable component of the epidemiological 
transition; these costs should be anticipated during the 
health planning processes of countries in that stage of the 
transition.
Disease-specifi
 c issues
Musculoskeletal disorders
Musculoskeletal disorders continue to be a leading cause 
of disability worldwide and more so when taking into 
account that additional musculoskeletal burden from 
long-term sequelae of fractures and dislocations is 
classifi
 ed under injuries in GBD. A key component of 
healthy ageing is to maintain mobility, and a key public 
health intervention recommended for improving health 
outcomes for all chronic diseases is physical activity. 
Painful musculoskeletal disorders increase with age and 
are a great threat to mobility, compromising health more 
broadly.34–36 Even if cures for musculoskeletal disorders 
are not yet available, the clinical goal of preventing 
disability is attainable.37,38
Mental and substance use disorders
Consistent with the fi
 ndings of earlier GBD studies, 
GBD 2015 confi
 rms the large contribution of mental and 
substance use disorders to global disability. For the fi
 rst 
time, in GBD 2015 we found a positive association 
between confl
 ict and depression and anxiety, albeit with 
wide uncertainty. This uncertainty is due to sparse and 
low-quality data for these disorders in post-confl
 ict 
countries. Going forward, we plan to make separate 
estimates for post-traumatic stress disorder in GBD, 
which might add considerably more data from confl
 ict 
settings and show a stronger association. GBD results 
have provided an evidence base to support global action 
such as a stated commitment by the World Bank and 
WHO to make mental health a global development 
priority39 and the consideration of mental health and 
substance use disorders in shaping the Sustainable 
Development Goals.40 Cost-eff
 ective interventions are 
able to reduce the burden imposed by mental and 
substance use disorders, including in low-income and 
middle-income countries.41

Figure 2: Leading 30 Level 3 causes of global YLDs for both sexes combined, 1990, 2005, and 2015, with percentage change in number of YLDs, and all-age and age-standardised rates
Causes are connected by lines between time periods. For the time period of 1990 to 2005 and for 2005 to 2015, three measures of change are shown: percent change in the number of YLDs, percent 
change in the all-age YLD rate, and percent change in the age-standardised YLD rate. YLD=years lived with disability. COPD=chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

highest prevalence of opioid dependence in decreasing 
order in 2015 were Iran, United Arab Emirates, Russia, 
Morocco, the USA, Australia, Ukraine, Tunisia, Belarus, 
Canada, and Iraq. Among these countries, we estimated 
the highest excess mortality from opioid dependence in 
the eastern European countries at about twice the level 
of that in the USA, Canada, and the north African and 
Middle Eastern countries; the lowest rate among these 
highly prevalent countries was in Australia. Within the 
USA, prescription opioids have been estimated to 
account for 37% of drug overdose deaths in 2013.42,43 
The availability of overdose response treatments in 
the form of naloxone kits to laypersons has also 
accelerated.44 An alternative approach is opioid 
substitution treatment to reduce the risk of overdose. 
The intensity at which countries use harm-reduction 
strategies such as needle exchange and opioid 
substitution programmes follows an inverse pattern,45 
with the most intense programmes in Australia, but 
very rare use of such strategies in eastern Europe, 
suggesting that embracing harm reduction is an 
eff
 ective means of reducing drug deaths.  
Diabetes
To obtain standard estimates for health loss due to diabetes 
for GBD 2015 using both fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 
means and standard deviations as well as diabetes 
prevalence, we re-extracted all available data from 1990 to 
2015. Across studies, we found 20 diff
 erent case defi
 nitions 
for diabetes. We also included, wherever possible, studies 
reporting on mean FPG but not diabetes prevalence, using 
a regression between mean FPG and diabetes prevalence 
from studies reporting on both. We have also made the 
assessment of diabetes prevalence more consistent with 
cause of death data for diabetes. Our improved eff
 orts at 
measuring the prevalence of diabetes confi
 rms the 
increase in global age-standardised incidence, prevalence, 
and YLDs. Of note, the increase in YLDs at the global scale 
is greater than the increase in YLLs, which refl
 ects 
improved access to treatments that lower case fatality. The 
rise of diabetes prevalence, related to the global increase in 
body-mass index,46 given the costs of treating the disease47 
and the related increases in cardiovascular risks, poses one 
of the more important challenges to health systems in the 
coming years. This is particularly the case in regions with 
high prevalence of diabetes such as central America, 
north Africa and the Middle East, and Oceania.  
Ezzati and colleagues48 and the International Diabetes 
Federation (IDF)49 have estimated diabetes prevalence for 
many countries; the intra-class correlation coeffi
  cient for 
the estimates from Ezzati and colleagues and the GBD 
for 2015 is 0·74, and for the IDF estimates is 0·65. These 
large diff
 erences appear to stem from the inclusion of 
cause of death data in the modelling for GBD and also 
from the inclusion of self-reported diabetes prevalence in 
the study by Ezzati and colleagues.48 In GBD, these 
sources were excluded from our analyses because of 
changing patterns in the prevalence of known and

unknown diabetes in surveys that vary with geography, 
making it diffi
  cult to crosswalk these studies.
Dementia
Brayne and colleagues50,51 reported that age-specifi
 c 
prevalence of Alzheimer’s was decreasing in the UK. Of 
the four studies in the USA with similar measurements 
over time that were reviewed, one showed a decrease, 
whereas 
no 
change 
in 
prevalence 
was 
seen 
in the remaining studies.52,53 Our assessment of 
age-standardised prevalence showed that Alzheimer’s 
and other dementias decreased slowly in the UK, by 
3·69% (2·53–4·85%) from 2005 to 2015, but remained 
constant in the rest of the world. The decrease might be 
due to reductions in vascular dementias rather than 
reductions in Alzheimer’s and other dementias. Our 
assessment also suggests that the number of individuals 
with Alzheimer’s disease increased from 21·7 million 
(18·9–24·8 million) worldwide in 1990 to 46·0 million 
(40·2–52·7 million) in 2015. Although it is useful to 
know that age-standardised rates might be starting to 
decrease, if only slightly, the rapid increase in the 
absolute number of cases points to the major challenge 
that dementia presents to societies with increasing life 
expectancy. This number is similar to the most recent 
estimates from the World Alzheimer Report 2015 that 
estimated 46·8 million people living with dementia in 
2015. However, there is less agreement about new cases 
per year: The World Alzheimer Report estimated 
9·9 million new cases of dementia per year in 2015 
compared with 6·44 million (5·52–7·45 million) new 
cases in 2015 estimated in GBD 2015. The World 
Alzheimer Report separately analysed prevalence and 
incidence whereas we use DisMod-MR 2.1 to produce 
internally consistent prevalence and incidence estimates. 
We observed a fundamental disagreement in the 
underlying incidence and prevalence data in many 
countries and decided to exclude incidence data from 
our modelling approach, putting greater trust in 
prevalence studies than incidence studies, arguing that 
the point of incidence in dementia is more diffi
  cult to 
establish than prevalence when the diagnosis over time 
becomes more established.

mild disability (DW 0·01–0·05), moderate disability (DW 0·05–0·1), severe 
disability (DW 0·1–0·3), and very severe disability (DW >0·3) for geographies 
of high (A) and low (B) quintiles of Socio-demographic Index in 2015
Disability weights are combined multiplicatively as 1−(1−DW1)(1− DW2)...
(1−DWn) for n comorbid sequelae. Socio-demographic Index (SDI) is calculated 
for each geography as a function of lag-dependent income per capita, average 
educational attainment in the population aged over 15 years, and the total 
fertility rate. SDI units are interpretable; a zero represents the lowest level of 
income per capita, educational attainment, and highest total fertility rate (TFR) 
observed from 1980 to 2015 and a one represents the highest income per 
capita, educational attainment, and lowest TFR observed in the same period. 
Cutoff
 s on the SDI scale for the quintiles have been selected based on 
examination of the entire distribution of geographies between 1980 and 2015.

Hepatitis C
The availability of new medical treatments for chronic 
hepatitis C has driven considerable interest in the 
prevalence data  for this disease. Available treatments are 
highly eff
 ective but costly.54 Some programmes have been 
launched in Egypt and other lower-SDI countries that 
off
 er treatment at lower cost. Good data on the number 
of courses of treatment that have been delivered are not 
widely available. Given the number of individuals with 
chronic infection and the potential to be cured, tracking 
the fraction of people treated each year should be 
undertaken. Even in high-income countries such as the 
USA, the fraction of those treated among those who 
would benefi
 t from treatment is not yet available.
Malaria
Our assessment of malaria prevalence and incidence in 
high burden sub-Saharan Africa was based on the Malaria 
Atlas Project spatial analysis of prevalence surveys done 
across Africa between 2000 and 2015.55,56 The dynamic 
map of malaria prevalence was updated for GBD 2015 and 
extended back to 1980. Children younger than 5 years 
in sub-Saharan Africa showed a remarkable 33·5% 
(24·8–46·0%) decrease in incidence from the 2005 peak 
of 0·78 (0·56–0·96) cases per person per year to 0·52 
(0·33–0·71) in 2015. Yet there were 81·7 million 
(52·0–111·7 million) incident cases in this age group in 
2015. The decrease in children was more rapid than that 
recorded for older age groups. In adolescents and adults, 
incidence 
dropped 
by 
30·0% 
(17·2–39·2%) 
and 
21·1% (15·3–26·9%), respectively, and resulted in 
58·7 million (37·7–91·5 million) and 53·3 million 
(40·7–67·5 million) incident cases, respectively, in 2015. 
The observed decreases in malaria incidence underscore 
the remarkable eff
 ect of the scale-up of antimalarial 
interventions57 across Africa in the past decade.55 
Sustaining the levels of these interventions is crucial to 
continue to reduce malaria morbidity on the continent, 
avoid resurgence, and improve on these levels that are 
vital to global aspirations for malaria eradication.58 Overall, 
we estimate there were 286·9 million (219·7–377·3 million) 
cases of malaria worldwide in 2015, whereas the World 
Malaria Report (WMR) 2015 reports 214 million 
(149–303 million) cases in 2015.59 Of these cases, the WMR 
estimates that 88% of cases occurred in the WHO African 
region (188 million) whereas we estimate 189·4 million 
(151·7–239·4 million; 66·1%) cases for GBD 2015. Outside 
of Africa, the WMR reports 26 million cases versus our 
estimate of 97·3 million (50·2–181·8 million), but both 
sets of estimates feature identical regional rankings 
among the six WHO regions with malaria. Increasing 
convergence in estimates is expected as dynamic maps of

malaria prevalence and incidence become available for all 
malaria-endemic countries outside of Africa.
Tuberculosis 
We added new data from tuberculosis prevalence surveys 
done in Indonesia, Ghana, and several subnational 
locations in India. Our analysis of tuberculosis relied on 
prevalence surveys, case notifi
 cations and cause-specifi
 c 
mortality estimates. We used the expert judgment values 
for the case-detection rates (CDRs) from WHO as an initial 
guide of how much notifi
 cations need to be increased to 
refl
 ect incidence of all tuberculosis, but relied on 
DisMod-MR 2.1 to fi
 nd an estimate that is consistent with 
available prevalence and cause-specifi
 c mortality rates. We 
found that, particularly in older age groups, our estimated 
CDR often falls below the all-age CDR of WHO. In 
GBD 2013, we used a relative risk approach to predict the 
proportion of HIV-infected individuals with tuberculosis. 
In GBD 2015, we improved our modelling strategy by 
making use of more abundantly available data on the 
proportions of HIV infected cases among all tuberculosis 
cases from the WHO case notifi
 cations to separate out 
combined HIV and tuberculosis from all forms of 
tuberculosis. In our modelling of tuberculosis, we have not 
separately estimated the incidence and prevalence related 
to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Given the policy 
interest in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, we plan to 
include estimates for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in 
future rounds of the GBD. Our global tuberculosis (all-
forms) incidence estimate (10·2 million [9·2–11·5 million] 
cases in 2015) is slightly higher than that of WHO 
(9·6 million cases in 2014), and we estimate a slightly 
larger fraction of combined HIV and tuberculosis (13·0%) 
than WHO (12·0%). Our list of countries with high burden 
of tuberculosis is consistent with that of WHO, with a few 
exceptions. Afghanistan and Cambodia are lower in our 
estimates, and surpassed by Ukraine and Angola.
Cardiovascular diseases
Ageing and population growth have led to a growing 
number of people living with atherosclerotic vascular 
disease worldwide, despite the decrease in incident 
myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke in high-
income regions. Rising levels of obesity and diabetes in 
many countries makes this an area of major concern for 
global health. Increased attention will need to be directed 
toward this highly treatable set of disorders. Health 
systems will need to improve the delivery of cost-eff
 ective 
treatments such as blood pressure and cholesterol-
lowering drugs while eff
 orts continue to focus on 
decreasing tobacco smoking, improving diet, and 
increasing physical activity. Investments in universal 
primary care and public health campaigns need to be 
balanced against the need to improve access to emergency 
care, including the strengthening of pre-hospital systems 
and expanded access to revascularisation treatments.
Cancer
The International Agency for Research on Cancer last 
produced cancer estimates by country, age, sex, and 
cancer site for 2012 for the GLOBOCAN project.60 The 
total estimated cancer incidence from GLOBOCAN for 
2012 was 14·1 million individuals. By comparison, GBD 
2015 estimated 18·6 million (18·0–19·4 million) new 
cases of cancer in 2015, which includes cases of non-
melanoma skin cancer. GLOBOCAN used nine diff

methods to estimate incidence, which precludes the 
calculation of uncertainty for those estimates. The GBD 
relies on the strength of the mortality estimates and 
transformation of the mortality estimates to incidence, 
taking into account uncertainty associated with both the 
mortality estimates and with the mortality to incidence 
ratios. Until high-quality cancer incidence is available in 
all countries, the GBD approach, which maximises the 
amount of data used to determine incidence estimates, is 
highly benefi
 cial.
Vision loss
Globally, 34·3 million (30·7–38·0 million) people are 
blind, an additional 24·3 million (21·6–27·6 million) 
have 
severe 
vision 
impairment, 
214 
million 
(193–237 million) have moderate vision impairment, and 
663 million (638–690 million) have near vision 
impairment in 2015. Combined, vision loss accounts for 
24·5 million (17·0–34·5 million) YLDs and is the third 
largest 
impairment 
after 
anaemia 
(77·9 
million 
[52·4–111·4 million] YLDs) and hearing loss (46·2 million 
[31·6–63·2 million] YLDs). YLDs from vision loss are 
slightly lower than those for anxiety disorders, 
which rank ninth worldwide. Largely due to ageing, 
substantial increases occurred from 2005 to 2015 in the 
number of people with blindness (increasing by 
23·3% 
[21·9–24·6%]), 
severe 
visual 
impairment 
(24·3% [22·4–26·0%]), moderate visual impairment 
(22·0% [20·1–23·7%]), and near vision impairment 
(22·5% [20·9–24·0%]). Most causes of vision loss can be 
prevented or cured using cost-eff
 ective interventions.61,62 
Chronic kidney disease 
Compared with our GBD 2013 estimates, we estimated 
global prevalence of chronic kidney disease to be lower 
by a third. Data for chronic kidney disease at younger 
ages are sparse. We increased the number of datapoints 
below the age of 30 years from 20 to 51, and that led to 
considerably lower prevalence estimates for these ages. 
We have used diff
 erent strategies for estimating deaths 
versus YLDs secondary to chronic kidney disease due to 
other causes. In our cause of death analysis, deaths 
secondary to many of the causes typically categorised 
within the chronic kidney disease other category, such as 
cystic disease and other congenital renal diseases, were 
already counted under the primary disease following the 
principles of the ICD, and thus could not be recounted 
within the chronic kidney disease other category. In 
comparison, for the YLD analysis we counted chronic 
kidney disease from these causes in the chronic kidney 
disease other category. This diff
 erence in the classifi
 cation 
of morbidity and mortality from chronic kidney disease 
other is driven by the underlying nature of the data on 
causes of death and prevalence. In future GBD versions, 
we plan to make explicit estimates of death and YLDs for 
polycystic kidney disease, an important component of 
the other category.
Emerging infectious diseases 
Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases pose a 
persistent yet dynamic challenge to global health63 and to 
the GBD study. GBD 2015 has included Ebola virus 
disease in response to the devastating outbreak in west 
Africa starting in 2013,64 whereas we have not captured the 
recent expansions of chikungunya65 and Zika virus across 
the Americas,66 for instance. Quantifying the eff
 ect of 
newly emerging epidemic diseases is diffi
  cult because the 
formal reporting of the disease events might considerably 
lag the fi
 rst presentation of cases. As a result, contemporary 
events such as the substantial deviation from baseline 
levels in reported congenital abnormalities in Brazil in 
2015,67 now established to be associated with Zika virus,68 
will need to be incorporated into GBD 2016.
Advances in data and analysis
DisMod-MR
For GBD 2015, we improved the estimation for subnational 
units in DisMod-MR 2.1 compared to GBD 2013 and made 
substantive eff
 orts to standardise the modelling approach 
across diseases. Three changes had an important eff
 ect on 
our estimates. First, the cascade was implemented such 
that national estimates were used to inform subnational 
estimation (in GBD 2013, each subnational unit was 
treated as a country within a GBD region). Second, 
wherever possible, we improved the linkage in the 
estimation between cause-specifi
 c mortality and disease 
incidence and prevalence by the systematic inclusion of 
estimated excess mortality data to provide more 
informative priors for each location in the geographical 
hierarchy. Third, in GBD 2010, and to a lesser degree in 
GBD 2013, many DisMod-MR models did not include 
fi
 xed eff
 ects of country covariates for incidence or 
prevalence. Spatial heterogeneity was largely estimated 
from the random eff
 ects. For GBD 2015, we systematically 
tested the inclusion of more fi
 xed eff
 ects in DisMod-MR 2.1 
models including, where appropriate, variables related to 
the risk factor exposures we estimate for each disease. 
Disability weights
For GBD 2015, we have not incorporated any new 
population-based data on disability weights; we have used 
the same disability weights as for GBD 2013. The present 
set of disability weights were based on population surveys 
in nine countries and an open internet survey. So far, 
these studies have not found systematic variation in 
disability weights across populations or within populations 
as a function of education, income per capita, or other 
variables. In future, we hope that more population surveys 
on disability weights will continue to be done to enrich the 
database for disability weight estimation. Given that we 
have not been able to collect disability weights in every 
location included in the GBD, it is possible that disability 
weights might vary systematically across communities. 
Even if this were to be confi
 rmed empirically, for global 
standardised comparisons we would still use the global

1591
average disability weights; however, country analyses 
might use local disability weights. Until there is evidence 
of systematic variation across communities, this remains 
a theoretical and not a practical consideration. Given the 
close correlation between the internet survey and the 
population-based surveys, we are considering the 
implementation of an open rolling internet survey to 
collect more data for disability weights including new or 
revised health-state descriptions.
GATHER compliance
Providing all documentation for data sources, establishing 
access to the datasets used in modelling, and posting the 
code has been a labour-intensive activity; GBD 2015 is 
compliant with the new GATHER guidelines as a result.17 
Posting code, we believe, will stimulate other researchers 
to explore the methods used in GBD estimation of non-
fatal outcomes and hopefully lead to suggestions for 
improved estimation. With a steadily growing set of co-
investigators and a widening community interested in 
global health estimation, the enhanced transparency of 
GBD will improve the effi
  cacy of the overall eff
 ort.
Using claims data
For the USA we used claims data for selected disorders. 
These data were particularly useful in the estimation of 
state-by-state prevalence for some disorders. Claims data, 
however, have important potential biases. Because of 
exclusion of some disadvantaged groups from health 
insurance, disease rates might be diff
 erent for individuals 
that are covered compared with those from the general 
population.69,70 As the claims dataset included information 
from Medicaid and Medicare, the coverage schemes for 
low-income citizens and older adults (older than 65 years) 
in the USA, the bias toward underestimation might not 
be so great. Indeed, we found that for many diseases, 
such as asthma, diabetes, or rheumatoid arthritis, the 
claims data were consistent with high-quality survey 
estimates. A potential problem of overestimation exists 
because visits to rule out a diagnosis can be coded to the 
diagnosis. Others working with claims have counted 
diagnoses only if they had appeared at least twice during 
a year. Applying such a restriction would have led to 
rejection of 44–68% of skin disorders, such as acne, 
psoriasis, or scabies, where one would expect that even 
after a single visit a diagnosis can be reliably made. As we 
tend to adjust the claims data used in DisMod-MR 2.1 if a 
systematic bias is detected from population-based 
sources, such as the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey or other quality surveys, we believe 
our estimates have not been infl
 uenced much by this 
problem. The potential for greater inclusion of claims 
data in the GBD analysis is large; in countries with 
universal health access, claims data might overcome the 
problems of non-responder bias in survey data, which 
tend to lead to underestimates of the true population 
prevalence or incidence.
Self-reported functional health status
We found only modest progress in high-SDI countries 
in reducing age-standardised YLDs per capita over the 
last 25 years. There are, however, reports in the literature 
of substantial improvements based on self-rated 
health.71,72 In the USA, these improvements seem to be 
survey programme-specifi
 c and have not been reported 
in all data systems.71 Nevertheless, more work is needed 
to understand the diff
 erent trends between our 
assessment of YLDs per capita and self-rated health. 
Item response theory has been used in some fi
 elds to 
identify changing response patterns for single items 
compared with the pool of all items.73 Item response 
theory cannot capture systematic changes that aff
 ect a 
set of items, and anchoring vignettes have been 
proposed as a strategy to deal with these challenges.72,74 
In the era of increased interest in measuring functional 
health status, more exploration of the reasons for 
the divergence from a sequelae-based approach to 
measuring functional health status used in GBD versus 
an overall self-rating will be an important avenue of 
future research.
Crosswalks
Because of the diversity of data sources available, 
we 
estimated 
the 
statistical 
association 
between 
measurements taken using diff
 erent case defi
 nitions, 
diff
 erent assays, diff
 erent survey items, or diff
 erent 
ascertainment methods to a reference category. We used 
these statistical associations to crosswalk each type of data 
to the reference category. Crosswalks are a crucial 
dimension in the GBD analysis; in most cases we estimate 
these crosswalks from within DisMod-MR 2.1. If 
crosswalks were believed to vary substantially by age, sex, 
or location, these crosswalks were estimated outside of 
DisMod-MR 2.1 and adjusted data were used as inputs. 
Where data are sparse, the estimated crosswalks can shift 
substantially when new studies are identifi
 ed that inform 
the crosswalk. With each iteration of the GBD, we have 
recognised the crucial nature of the crosswalk analysis for 
data processing. We believe that more research is needed 
in future iterations of GBD to standardise the approaches 
used for estimating crosswalks across disorders and risk 
factors, and for propagating uncertainty in crosswalks into 
the fi
 nal results.
Data gaps
We have described the availability of data by cause and 
geography over diff
 erent time periods, highlighting very 
large gaps in information availability. The data availability 
by country ranged from 6·1% in North Korea to 91·3% in 
the USA (methods appendix p 606). Among the top fi
 ve 
causes of YLDs, data availability was rather poor. Lower 
back pain, iron-defi
 ciency anaemia, major depressive 
disorder, other hearing loss, and neck pain all have data 
representativeness indices below 50%. Because of the 
broad overview provided of major data sources for disease 
 Articles
1592 
www.thelancet.com   Vol 388   October 8, 2016
incidence and prevalence, GBD provides a framework to 
assist countries in prioritising the collection of new data 
to inform better monitoring of functional health status. 
By setting clear reference case defi
 nitions and data 
collection methods (methods appendix pp 4–7), GBD can 
also provide guidance on how to collect information most 
relevant to population health measurement.
Future directions for GBD
With each cycle of the GBD we expect, given the present 
interest in subnational assessments, to report increasingly 
granular results. These subnational fi
 ndings will be of 
important national policy interest, but the discipline of 
examining the evidence for each community and modelling 
at the more granular level will, we believe, improve the 
quality of the national estimation as well. Additions to the 
cause list will continue to be driven by policy interest, such 
as the need to incorporate Zika virus, to split diabetes into 
separate estimates for type 1 and type 2, and by adding 
diseases to our cause list that are main contributors to large 
residual categories, such as other cardiovascular disease, 
other musculoskeletal disorders, and other neurological 
disorders. We plan to continue to expand our networks of 
topic-specifi
 c and country collaborators to enhance the 
quality of our estimates through their feedback and by 
enhancing the amount of data we can bring to bear on 
GBD estimation. Our country collaborations to generate 
subnational estimates have shown us that these eff
 orts 
greatly enhance access to valuable data sources, particularly 
administrative datasets on inpatient and outpatient 
episodes and unpublished surveys.
Limitations
The GBD 2015 study has some key limitations. First, 
although we have sought to capture and include in our 
estimations many sources of uncertainty, we have not 
captured all sources. We have not been able to routinely 
capture uncertainty due to diff
 erent model specifi
 cations 
in our results. We do not have the ability to refl
 ect the 
uncertainty of data sources that exist but of which we are 
not aware. Subnational collaborations in China and 
Mexico revealed many data sources not captured in 
previous iterations of the GBD study. Inclusion of these 
data sources can lead to shifts in estimates that are 
outside the previously estimated 95% UIs.
Second, within DisMod-MR 2.1 we estimate the average 
association between diff
 erent types of studies for reporting 
on a specifi
 c outcome such as the diff
 erence between 
12-month recall and point prevalence in a survey. These 
estimated associations from within the DisMod-MR 2.1 
likelihood estimation are used to adjust the data to a 
reference case defi
 nition or study design. These estimated 
adjustment factors are themselves uncertain, which 
increases the overall uncertainty in our estimation. More 
standardisation in data collection would be highly desirable 
and would reduce our dependence on the relatively 
challenging estimation process involved in crosswalks.
Third, for some disorders the data available to estimate 
excess mortality by age and sex and to capture how excess 
mortality changes with development status are very 
limited. There are probably many unpublished sources 
of information in some countries that could be usefully 
brought to bear on the challenge of estimating the 
age–sex–year–location levels of excess mortality.
Fourth, the microsimulation step of this study assumes 
that prevalence within an age–sex–location–year group of 
diff
 erent sequelae is independent. Although this is clearly 
known not to be the case for some pairs of disorders, the 
independence assumption provides reasonable overall 
adjustments for comorbidity. Progress in incorporating 
dependent comorbidity has been diffi
  cult because 
information on the correlation structure of prevalence is 
extremely limited and only available for a minor fraction 
of all possible pairs of conditions in the GBD study.
Fifth, we estimated separate DisMod-MR 2.1 models for 
1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Independent 
estimation of each time period implies that the uncertainty 
intervals for each period are also independent. Furthermore, 
compositional bias in the data available in diff
 erent time 
periods might lead to spurious time trends. A more 
appealing strategy would be to simultaneously estimate the 
trends in incidence, excess mortality, and remission by age 
and sex consistent with all the available data for a geography 
on prevalence, incidence, remission, excess mortality, and 
cause-specifi
 c mortality by age and sex. DisMod-MR 2.1 
does not allow for time-varying trends in incidence, excess 
mortality, and remission, but a prototype DisMod-MR AT 
(age and time) has been developed and is being tested. 
Allowing for all rates to change at diff
 erent paces over age 
and time increases the number of parameters that need to 
be estimated by orders of magnitude.
Sixth, we have emphasised in the reporting of results 
the changes from calendar year 2005 to calendar 
year 2015, although we have estimated results for 1990, 
1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 and interpolated for the 
years in between. For some disorders, reporting the 
change from 2005 to 2015 (such as for Ebola virus 
disease) does not capture the major epidemic in west 
Africa in 2014. Likewise, disasters and wars are often 
concentrated in a single year; comparisons of any two 
years can provide misleading inferences about trends.
Seventh, for a few disorders (eg, tetanus, neonatal sepsis, 
rabies, and diphtheria) we estimate disease incidence from 
estimates of mortality and the inverse of the case-fatality 
rate estimated from available studies. When the case-
fatality rate is very low, these estimates of incidence are 
highly sensitive to very small changes in the estimated 
case-fatality rate and have large uncertainty intervals.
Finally, although extraordinary eff
 orts have gone into 
vetting the results by GBD researchers and the 
collaborator network, there are probably some fi
 ndings 
that have not been scrutinised carefully enough. Making 
all results and underlying data available and having an 
increasing number of visualisation tools are eff

strategies that we will keep expanding to meet our goal of 
producing the highest quality global health data to our 
growing audience of policy makers, researchers, the 
media, and the general population.
Conclusion
The GBD studies seek to quantify the prevalence and 
incidence of the major sequelae for a comprehensive list 
of diseases and injuries; given the diversity of data 
sources, the range of biases in these sources, and the 
gaps in availability, this is a challenging task. Despite 
the limitations, the standardised and comprehensive 
approach of the GBD studies  study provides useful 
insights. We believe users of the fi
 ndings, including the 
wealth of country-specifi
 c and cause-specifi
 c detail 
available in the appendix, can usefully examine the broad 
trends for their country or subnational geography, 
benchmark against geographies at a similar level of 
development, and understand the strength or weakness 
of these estimates. Regular quantifi
 cation of health is 
particularly important as the new health-related targets 
of the Sustainable Development Goals have broadened 
the health agenda throughout the world. At the same 
time, development and transformations in the risks to 
health experienced by diff
 erent groups in the world are 
leading to some broad transformations in health. 
Everyone needs to have access to the timeliest, valid, 
reliable, and local information possible to enrich debates 
on how to accelerate health progress in all communities.
