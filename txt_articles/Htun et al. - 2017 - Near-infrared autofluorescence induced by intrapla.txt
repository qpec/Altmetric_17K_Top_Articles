Atherosclerosis is a major cause of mortality and morbidity, which is mainly driven by
complications such as myocardial infarction and stroke. These complications are caused by
thrombotic arterial occlusion localized at the site of high-risk atherosclerotic plaques, of
which early detection and therapeutic stabilization are urgently needed. Here we show that
near-infrared autofluorescence is associated with the presence of intraplaque hemorrhage
and heme degradation products, particularly bilirubin by using our recently created mouse
model, which uniquely reflects plaque instability as seen in humans, and human carotid
endarterectomy samples. Fluorescence emission computed tomography detecting near-
infrared autofluorescence allows in vivo monitoring of intraplaque hemorrhage, establishing a
preclinical technology to assess and monitor plaque instability and thereby test potential
plaque-stabilizing drugs. We suggest that near-infrared autofluorescence imaging is a novel
technology that allows identification of atherosclerotic plaques with intraplaque hemorrhage
and ultimately holds promise for detection of high-risk plaques in patients.

 A
lthough atherosclerosis is usually described as a single
disease entity with significant morbidity and mortality
worldwide, not all atherosclerotic lesions or plaques are
the same with vast differences in their composition and natural
history1–5. Some plaques remain quiescent and stable for years
and others become unstable and vulnerable, ultimately leading to
plaque rupture. Plaque rupture is the main cause of thrombosis
and occlusion of arteries leading to potentially catastrophic out-
comes such as stroke and myocardial infarction (MI), the latter
being the most frequent single reason of death6, 7. The develop-
ment of a method to reliably identify high-risk atherosclerotic
plaques is seen as one of the major quests of contemporary car-
diovascular medicine. It would provide the opportunity to apply
prophylactic treatment, either pharmacological or interventional,
and thus to prevent e.g. MI and its associated substantial mor-
bidity and mortality.
Significant efforts have been made to characterize and risk
stratify carotid and coronary atherosclerotic plaques using various
imaging technologies. We here propose the use of near-infrared
autofluorescence (NIRAF) for the identification of high-risk
atherosclerotic
plaques.
Investigators
previously
used
low-
wavelength (300–400 nm) fluorescence technology to assess pla-
que composition, detecting fluorescence signals of collagen,
elastin, and oxidized low density lipoprotein, typically as com-
ponents of the lipid core8–13. However, this technology was
limited by poor specificity, as low wavelength fluorescence is not
exclusively emitted by lipid core associated materials, as well as
poor signal-to-noise ratio and weak tissue penetration caused by
hindering tissue autofluorescence and strong photon absorp-
tion14,
15. In contrast, our study demonstrates that auto-
fluorescence
in
the
NIR
range
uniquely
characterizes
atherosclerotic plaques with intraplaque hemorrhage and may
allow classification of atherosclerotic plaques into lesions of low
or high risk for future cardiovascular events.
We have previously developed a mouse model that exhibits
unstable plaques as seen in humans16. This mouse model was
instrumental for the description of NIRAF as a potential indicator
of an atherosclerotic plaque’s risk in causing future cardiovascular
events. In addition to human CEA samples, this model allowed us
to identify intraplaque hemorrhage and heme degradation pro-
ducts as sources of the detected NIRAF signal. Besides estab-
lishing
fluorescence
emission
tomography
(FLECT)
as
a
preclinical tool for the detection of plaques with intraplaque
hemorrhage and its potential use in testing and monitoring of
plaque-stabilizing drugs, our report has the potential to support
technical developments for imaging technologies that will ulti-
mately allow to risk stratify atherosclerotic plaques in patients
and, in particular, to identify plaques that are prone to cause
cardiovascular events.
Results
NIRAF in atherosclerotic plaques. Both human and murine
atherosclerotic samples were used in this study. With informed
consent, human CEA specimens were collected from patients who
presented to the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia with
clinical indications for CEA.
To investigate human atherosclerotic plaques, 50 CEA samples
freshly taken from patients in the operating theater were
immediately scanned using the Odyssey Imaging System before
being snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C prior to further analysis.
Of which, 26 samples were from patients who presented with
symptoms such as stroke or transient ischemic attacks, while
24 samples were from asymptomatic patients. Patients with
symptoms can be assumed to harbor more complicated plaques,
whereas
asymptomatic
patients
underwent
endarterectomy
because
they
had
high-grade,
severely
stenotic
lesions
(>70–80% luminal stenosis on vascular ultrasound or CT
angiogram). Hence the CEA samples obtained will exhibit a
mixture
of
advanced
atherosclerosis
including
histological
characteristics of unstable as well as stable plaque pathology.
Thirty-one out of 50 CEA samples collected (62%) showed
significant intrinsic autofluorescence (mean fluorescence intensity
(MFI)>20) in the NIR range (NIRAF, Fig. 1a, c, d). To provide a
comparison and scale for the MFI measurements, samples were
scanned together with a serial dilution of IRDye800CW. Overall,
MFI ± standard error of the mean (SEM) was 404.7 ± 83.2 for
fluorescent plaques in contrast to 10.3 ± 3.2 in non-fluorescent
plaques (background fluorescence) (p < 0.0001, unpaired Stu-
dent’s t-test).
To confirm the fluorescence nature of the CEA specimens, an
additional technology capable of NIR fluorescence detection was
used. The WITec Raman 300R system (WITec, Germany) utilized
an excitation laser source of 785 nm to detect autofluorescence
emission signals. This was achieved by integrating the area under
the curve between 4000 and 150 cm−1, which is equivalent to
integrating the area between 794 and 1144 nm, when taking into
consideration the Stokes shift using 785 nm excitation. At 785 nm
no Raman bands were observed as the background fluorescence
dominated the spectral profile. Hence, the images produced are
based on sample autofluorescence and not Raman scattering.
Both paraffin-embedded tissue sections and cryosections of CEA
samples of 5 µm thickness were scanned and showed no method-
dependent differences. This imaging technique was able to
reproduce the findings of the Odyssey Imaging System and
demonstrated the intrinsic fluorescence in CEA samples at 785
nm excitation (Fig. 1b). To further justify the chosen cut-off value
of MFI>20, a detailed histological assessment of five cross section
segments was provided (seg-a–seg-e, 5 mm distance between each
segment, Fig. 1c and d). Seg-a showed pathological intimal
thickening (MFI = 2). Seg-b revealed mild lipid accumulation
(MFI = 10). Seg-c showed an atheroma with multiple foam cell
macrophages (MFI = 20), while seg-d (MFI = 200) and seg-e
(MFI = 1000) showed fibroatheromas with intraplaque hemor-
rhages (Fig. 1e). Overall, these histological features support our
rationale in choosing MFI>20 as the cut-off point to discriminate
plaques with morphological features of plaque instability from
those without.
Murine atherosclerotic samples were obtained using the
“tandem stenosis model” (TS model) of atherosclerosis in mice
as described by Chen et al.16. This murine model is unique in its
reflection of histological plaque instability as seen in humans.
Briefly, a surgical ligation procedure (tandem ligation of the
carotid artery, Supplementary Fig. 1) was performed to create a
TS of the carotid artery of ApoE−/− mice fed with high fat diet
(6 weeks on western diet at 12 weeks of age). Seven weeks
postoperatively, disruption of fibrous caps, intraplaque hemor-
rhage, intraluminal thrombosis, neovascularization, and other
characteristics of plaque instability/rupture as described in
humans were seen in these mice16 (segment I in Supplementary
Fig. 1). This model was ideal for our study since it provided
comparative tissue samples of unstable plaques with plaque
rupture/intraplaque hemorrhage (segment I), stable plaques
(segment III or V) and normal arterial wall (segment IV) in the
same mouse (Supplementary Fig. 1), thereby allowing a direct
comparison of plaque characteristics to each other16.
Seven weeks after TS surgery, mice were euthanized and the
aortic arch, along with its main branches, harvested as previously
described16, and scanned freshly with the Odyssey Imaging
System (Fig. 2a). Intraplaque hemorrhage was a striking feature of
the atherosclerotic plaques in segment I, as confirmed macro-
scopically as well as by hemoglobin and glycophorin A staining

 (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). Plaque segments with intraplaque
hemorrhage developed clearly detectable NIRAF properties (MFI
± SEM of 2.66 ± 0.28, n = 15) in contrast to histologically stable
plaques, which showed only minimal fluorescence (MFI ± SEM of
1.32 ± 0.08, n = 15) (Fig. 2b). The healthy artery served as a
control (Fig. 2c). Serial cross-sections (seg-a–seg-d, approxi-

cryosection) showing the oxidation state marker band ν4 at 1371 cm−1 assigned to a symmetric pyrrole half-ring stretching vibration consistent with the Fe
ion being in the ferric state associated with oxygenated hemoglobin. b Raman spectra from NIRAF murine carotid sample (40 µm cryosection). The spectra
of the plaques appear to show a mixture of heme products as evidenced by the position of ν4, which appears at 1360 cm−1 indicative of ferrous heme but
also shows a shoulder feature at ~1371 cm−1, which is associated with ferric heme indicating a mixture of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. In
oxygenated hemoglobin, which is in the ferric low spin state, this band normally appears between 1376 and 1370 cm−1. In deoxygenated hemoglobin, where
the Fe ion is in the ferrous high spin state, this band normally appears between 1360 and 1350 cm−1. A number of other strong heme bands are observed in
the spectra of the plaques. These include bands at 1620 cm−1, 1582 cm−1, 1544 cm−1 assigned to C=C and C–C bonds of the porphyrin backbone a, b.

 from non-fluorescent plaques. To record resonance Raman
spectra, we had to choose an excitation wavelength well apart
from the NIR fluorescence and hence we applied 413 nm. Reso-
nance Raman spectra were recorded using a Spectra Physics
Stabilite 2017 argon ion laser system coupled to a Renishaw
Raman 2000 spectrometer and interfaced to a Leica Raman
microscope. Resonance Raman spectra from the fluorescent
atheromatous plaques showed distinct peaks (Fig. 3a and b) that
closely resembled the spectrum of deoxygenated hemoglobin
(Fig. 3c). We therefore assigned these peaks to heme modes.
Importantly, these peaks were not detected in the plaques without
NIRAF (Fig. 3d and e). Moreover, mouse plaques exhibiting

 NIRAF had almost identical characteristic fingerprints—except
for differences in intensity (Fig. 3b and c). These findings were
consistent for both human and murine unstable plaque samples.
The detailed peak assignments are shown in Supplementary
Table 1 including spectra for comparison from oxygenated
hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin with hemin (FePPIX-Cl),
and hematin (FePPIX-OH)17, recorded at the same excitation
wavelength. The spectra obtained from the fluorescent plaques in
mice and humans reveal a mixture of heme products as evidenced
by the position of ν4, which appears between 1360 and 1371 cm−1
and is assigned to a symmetric pyrrole half-ring stretching
vibration17. This band is known as the oxidation state marker
band because it is sensitive to the oxidation state of iron17. In
oxygenated hemoglobin, which is in the ferric low spin state, this
band normally appears between 1376 and 1370 cm−1. In deox-
ygenated hemoglobin, where the Fe ion is in the ferrous high spin
state, this band normally appears between 1360 and 1350 cm−1.
Figure 3c shows the spectrum of hemoglobin recorded using 413
nm excitation, which shows a strong band at 1360 cm−1 and a
shoulder at 1372 cm−1, indicating this contains a mixture of
ferrous and ferric iron. The appearance of ν4 between 1360 and
1371 cm−1 in the fluorescent plaques indicates that the heme-
based compounds in these plaques are also likely to be a mixture
of oxidation states as this lies between the wave number values
expected for ferric and ferrous heme. The likely origin of these
mixed redox states of heme in atheromatous plaques is the oxi-
dation and reduction of hemoglobin at the sites of intraplaque
hemorrhage. A number of other strong heme bands are also
observed in the spectra obtained from the plaques. These include
bands at 1620 cm−1, 1582 cm−1, 1544 cm−1 assigned to C=C and
C–C bonds of the porphyrin backbone and other bands at 753
and 666 cm−1 assigned to pyrrole breathing and deformation
modes, respectively17. Due to the inherent nature of athero-
sclerosis that contains a mixture of different biological tissues, the
Raman signals of heme degradation products from the plaques
are likely to be shifted to some extent by co-existing compounds
within the plaque rather than exhibiting classical Raman spectra
of pure chemicals.
In the event of intraplaque hemorrhage, inflammatory cells e.g.
macrophages phagocytose extravasated red blood cells (RBCs),
leading to induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Heme derived
from the ingested RBC hemoglobin is then metabolized to
biliverdin via the enzyme HO-1. Biliverdin is subsequently
reduced to bilirubin via biliverdin reductase. In order to
investigate this further, we obtained pure standards of hemoglo-
bin, protoporphyrin IX, biliverdin and bilirubin to cover the
whole spectrum of heme metabolism) and determined their
Raman spectra. The spectra of biliverdin and bilirubin differed
markedly from those of hemoglobin and protoporphyrin IX
because the porphyrin structure is no longer present in biliverdin
and bilirubin. Overall, Raman spectra of atherosclerotic plaques
with NIRAF are clearly dominated by hemoglobin signals (Fig. 3,
Supplementary Fig. 3).
NIRAF of heme precursors and heme degradation products.
Based on the resonance Raman spectra obtained from ather-
omatous plaques, intraplaque hemorrhage is considered to be the
likely source of the autofluorescence signals. Hence fluorescence
characteristics at the NIR range of blood and its related products
(fresh blood, old blood, oxidized RBCs, hemoglobin and its
degradation products to reflect the stages of biological degrada-
tion process, when hemorrhage occurs inside the plaque) were
investigated using the Odyssey Imaging System.
Samples of fresh and old blood obtained from mice were also
scanned using the Odyssey System. No fluorescence signals were
detected in the NIR range, indicating blood by itself, either fresh
or old, is not responsible for the NIRAF found in atherosclerotic
plaques (Supplementary Material, Supplementary Fig. 4).
NIRAF of the commercially available protoporphyrin IX,
hemoglobin, ferrous-stabilized hemoglobin, biliverdin and bilir-
ubin (5 mg each) was then explored. While hemoglobin, ferrous-
stabilized hemoglobin and biliverdin did not exhibit any
fluorescence on the Odyssey System, the heme precursor
protoporphyrin IX and the final heme degradation product
bilirubin revealed intrinsic fluorescence in the NIR range
(Fig. 4a).
Bilirubin extraction from the plaque tissues with auto-
fluorescence. Seven human CEA plaque samples with NIRAF and
seven samples of human carotid arterial segments without NIRAF
were excised and weighed (120 mg each). A standard chloroform-
based extraction was used to extract bilirubin from these sam-
ples18, 19 and bilirubin concentration (represented as absorbance
at 476 nm) in the extracted fluid was measured with a Cary 60
UV–vis Spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies). As demon-
strated in Fig. 4b, the arterial segments without NIRAF showed
minimal absorbance (all below 0.007 which was the cut-off value
for detection of bilirubin) (mean absorbance ± SEM of 0.003 ±
0.001). The plaque samples with NIRAF showed absorbance more
than 10 times higher (mean absorbance ± SEM of 0.040 ± 0.012).
These findings support the hypothesis that NIRAF of plaques
originates from heme degradation in areas of intraplaque
hemorrhage.
Mass spectrometry of heme and its degradation products in the
TS model. Mass spectrometry offers the possibility to determine
the concentrations of heme and its degradation products (bili-
verdin and bilirubin) in small amounts of tissues, such as plaques
of the TS mouse model. The heme, biliverdin and bilirubin

 content in histologically defined unstable (segment I) and stable
plaques (segment V)16, collected at 1, 4, and 7 weeks post TS
surgery, was determined using liquid chromatography–tandem
spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) on an Agilent 1290 binary pump
connected to a 6490 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). The content of heme, biliverdin
and bilirubin in stable plaques remained low and unchanged at all
time points (Fig. 4c). In contrast, bilirubin content significantly
increased in unstable plaques (segment I) at 7 weeks, compared to
1 week or 4 weeks post TS (Fig. 4c). Heme and biliverdin also
showed an increase at 7 weeks; however this was not statistically
significant (Fig. 4c). At 7 weeks post TS surgery, the mean bilir-
ubin content in unstable plaques (segment I) was ~1 pmol mg−1
whereas the mean heme content was approximately 2 nmol mg−1.
The finding of higher bilirubin contents in unstable plaques in TS
mice was consistent with the bilirubin extraction data from human
CEA samples.
Bilirubin supports a broad range of NIRAF. Using the IVIS
Lumina Series II Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences) we com-
pared the NIRAF characteristics of hemoglobin and bilirubin over a
wide range of excitation wavelength. Whereas hemoglobin shows
again no NIRAF, bilirubin shows NIRAF at a broad range of dif-
ferent excitation wavelengths (605, 640, 675, 710, and 745 nm) with
detection of NIR signals above 810 nm (Supplementary Fig. 5,
including bilirubin as control dissolved at various concentrations).
Bilirubin’s NIRAF was further confirmed by strong fluorescence
signals in the liver (with known abundance of bilirubin, Supple-
mentary Fig. 6). Overall, bilirubin’s NIRAF characteristic is highly
favorable as it provides substantial flexibility for device development.
Co-localization of NIRAF and bilirubin. Lastly, co-localization
of NIRAF signals and bilirubin in human high-risk plaques was
confirmed in fluorescence microscopy (NIR filter: Ex: 740/13, Em:
809/81) after staining CEA samples with Alexa 647 dye-labeled
anti-bilirubin antibody (Cy5 filter: Ex: 650/13, Em: 684/24;

 Evidence of intraplaque hemorrhage in NIRAF plaques.
Human samples of normal tunica intima as the innermost layer
of the arterial wall, atheromatous plaques with a large lipid core
without intraplaque hemorrhage, and atheromatous plaques with
intraplaque hemorrhage were scanned using the Odyssey System.
Significant NIRAF was seen only in plaques with intraplaque
hemorrhage but not in the normal tunica intima or lipid-rich
plaques without hemorrhage (Fig. 5a and b). Subsequently,
human CEA samples with focal areas of NIRAF were sectioned
into 5 different segments (seg-a–e) and NIRAF and histology of
each segment obtained (Fig. 1c–e and Fig. 6). These segments
with varying degrees of NIRAF intensity (seg-a shows a MFI of 2,
seg-b of 10, seg-c of 20, seg-d of 200, and seg-e of 1000,
respectively) were tested for immunohistochemical evidence of
intraplaque hemorrhage using antibodies to glycophorin A (a
major RBC membrane antigen), the hemoglobin alpha subunit,
and bilirubin (Supplementary Materials). Positive staining for
glycophorin A and hemoglobin was most pronounced in seg-d
(with MFI of 200) and seg-e (with MFI of 1000) and minimal in
seg-a (with MFI of 2), while bilirubin staining was entirely
negative in seg-a and of highest intensity in seg-d and e (Fig. 6).
During the process of hemoglobin breakdown, iron will be
released and is expected to be present as hemosiderin in the areas
of intraplaque hemorrhage. Iron staining based on the Prussian
blue reaction (using an iron stain kit) was performed to test the
presence of iron/hemosiderin in human CEA specimens with or
without NIRAF (see Supplementary Materials for the detailed
description of iron staining). Staining was strongly positive in the
CEA samples with NIRAF and only minimal in the CEA samples
without NIRAF, indicating that areas of fluorescence match the
areas of intraplaque hemorrhage (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Monitoring plaque characteristics induced by pharmacological
interventions. Heme oxygenase 1 expression has been demon-
strated in atherosclerotic lesions in both animal and human
studies and it has been implicated to be atheroprotective20, 21.
Cheng et al.22 demonstrated that HO-1 induction by cobalt
protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX) impeded atherosclerotic lesion
progression into vulnerable plaques in ApoE−/− mice, resulting in
reduced size of the necrotic cores, less intraplaque lipid accu-
mulation and an increased ratio of fibrous cap thickness/intimal
vascular smooth muscle cells, whereas inhibition of HO-1 by zinc
protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX) augmented plaque instability. We
hypothesized that the manipulation of HO-1 activity by ZnPPIX
and CoPPIX will be an ideal test to evaluate whether the newly
detected NIRAF characteristic would be suitable to detect and
monitor changes in histological plaque instability.
Tandem stenosis surgery was performed on ApoE−/− mice
(6 weeks on western diet at 12 weeks of age). CoPPIX (HO-1
inducer) and ZnPPIX (HO-1 inhibitor) were used for HO-1
enzyme modulation. Two weeks after the TS surgery, intraper-
itoneal injections of heme oxygenase modulators (5 mg/kg of
ZnPPIX or CoPPIX, dissolved in 0.2 M NaOH with PBS (without
Ca2+/Mg2+) at pH 7.4) were performed as described by Cheng
et al.22 every second day for 5 weeks. The mice were sacrificed
after 5 weeks of intraperitoneal injections. The timeline of this
experiment is shown in Fig. 7a. Three groups of 8 mice each were
used (one group receiving ZnPPIX injection, one group receiving
CoPPIX injection and one group receiving the vehicle injection;
the vehicle being 0.2 M NaOH with PBS (without Ca2+/Mg2+) at
pH 7.4).
The unstable plaques (segment I of the TS model) from all
three groups of mice were freshly harvested and imaged using the
Odyssey Imaging System. The ZnPPIX group showed signifi-
cantly higher fluorescence intensity (MFI ± SEM of 3.05 ± 0.38)
compared to the other two groups (MFI ± SEM of 1.90 ± 0.19 in
the CoPPIX group and MFI ± SEM of 2.08 ± 0.23 in the vehicle
group) (Fig. 7b). The carotid arterial segments were then
embedded in “optimal cutting temperature” compound and
stored at −80 °C. Quantification of the plaque burden and
necrotic core was performed by Optimus 6.2 VideoPro software
using Oil Red O and H&E staining, respectively. The ZnPPIX
group demonstrated significantly higher plaque burden and
percentage of necrotic core of total lesion, as a measure of plaque
instability, compared to the other two groups (mean plaque
burden in cubic microliters ± SEM of 85,300 ± 12,400 in the
ZnPPIX group, 30,400 ± 800 in the CoPPIX group and 49,800 ±
7900 in the vehicle group) (Fig. 7c and d). We saw only a
statistically non-significant trend in reduction of plaque burden,
necrotic core and also NIRAF under the CoPPIX treatment,
which may be related to this study arm being underpowered.
Nevertheless, overall NIRAF measurements seem to reflect
changes (or no changes) in plaque instability. Immunohisto-
chemical staining of hemoglobin and glycophorin A in the three
treatment groups further confirmed the presence of RBCs and
hemoglobin in the regions of plaque instability (segment I)
(Fig. 7e).
These findings indicate that changes in histologically defined
plaque instability can be detected and monitored by NIRAF
measurements.
Fluorescence emission computed tomography imaging of the
TS model. FLECT scanning (TriFiol, Chatsworth, CA) was used
to obtain three-dimensional NIRAF images of mice with the TS
model, exhibiting high-risk atherosclerotic plaques. NIRAF was
detected in TS mice exhibiting intraplaque hemorrhage (Fig. 8a),
but not in mice with the same TS surgery that did not develop
intraplaque hemorrhage (Fig. 8b, note: ~50% of mice developed
intraplaque hemorrhage in segment I of the TS model16). The
subsequent CT images confirmed NIRAF signals are localized to
segment I of the carotid artery (Fig. 8a). To further demonstrate
the anatomical position of the NIRAF, we provide the three
dimensional
reconstruction
of
the
FLECT
(Supplementary
Movies 1 and 2). Mice were then euthanized and the carotid
artery segments harvested and scanned with the Odyssey System,
which confirmed the presence of NIRAF (Fig. 8c and d). Repre-
sentative macroscopic pictures depict the distinct phenotypes of
atherosclerotic plaque (Fig. 8e) either with or without hemor-
rhage after TS surgery (Fig. 8f).
Discussion
Although some of the components of plaques such as collagen,
elastin, some extracellular lipids and ceroids/lipofuscin have been
shown to exhibit intrinsic fluorescence when excited in the violet
and blue range (325–475 nm)8–13, fluorescence measurements of
atherosclerotic plaques in the NIR range reported here has sub-
stantial technical advantages compared to lower wavelength
imaging. NIR fluorescence imaging (650–900 nm) encounters
markedly less photon absorption, has better tissue penetration
and less background autofluorescence of tissues15. Various
extrinsic fluorophores for a variety of molecular targets (matrix
metalloproteinases23, 24, macrophages24, and cathepsins15, 24–27)
have been tested in animal models of atherosclerotic plaque
development in mice23, 27 and New Zealand rabbits25, 26 with a
focus on intravascular probes. Our study describes and char-
acterizes NIR fluorescence signals in atheromatous plaques
without the requirement of external fluorophores. The areas of
NIRAF coincide with the areas of intraplaque hemorrhage with
higher concentrations of bilirubin, the major breakdown product

 of heme. Our study indicates the source of NIRAF likely to be the
heme degradation product bilirubin.
Porphyrin derivatives have long been described as fluorophores
with emission spectra reaching red and infrared ranges28–33.
Some of the NIR dyes were synthesized using porphyrin-based
compounds29. Bilirubin was also known to exhibit intrinsic
fluorescence in the 400–500 nm range34 and was recently also
reported to have an emission peak at 660 nm while excited at 615
nm, which is consistent with our findings35. Naturally occurring
protoporphyrin IX, a precursor of heme, showed autofluorescence
in the NIR spectrum36. Fluorescence signals of these compounds
are not constant in intensity and can change markedly with
protein binding. Bilirubin’s fluorescence is enhanced with albu-
min binding37–39 or binding with metals (e.g., tetrapyrroles
fluorescence quenches significantly with iron40 and bilirubin
fluorescence quenches with gold41). Even interaction with human
erythrocyte ghosts seems to enhance the fluorescence of bilir-
ubin42. In our experiments, bilirubin displayed NIRAF on the
Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. Bilirubin is sufficient for
NIRAF generation, although other atheroma-based molecules,
including the heme precursor protoporphyrin IX, could be
additional sources of NIRAF. Hence it is likely that heme

 degradation products accumulate in the areas of intraplaque
hemorrhage and mixed with various proteins, lipids and necrotic
debris then become a source of NIRAF.
Interestingly, Raman spectra collected from plaques with
NIRAF showed predominantly hemoglobin signals, rather than
bilirubin signals. Most likely the Raman spectra are overloaded by
hemoglobin. Mass spectrometry-based measurements of heme
and bilirubin in unstable carotid plaques from segment I of TS
mice (Fig. 4c) showed more than 1000-fold higher heme than
bilirubin concentrations. The high concentration of heme in these
plaques and its resonant enhancement at 413 nm are the likely
explanations for Raman signals of fluorescent plaques to pre-
dominantly represent hemoglobin.
Intraplaque hemorrhage is one of the classical histological
features of plaque instability43–45 and it is believed to be caused
either by rupture of thin fibrous caps or by leaky vessels as a result
of extensive neovascularisation of unstable atheromatous pla-
ques46. Intraplaque hemorrhage has been shown not only to be a
common feature of larger arteries but also of high-risk coronary
plaques. Kolodgie et al.47 found that 77% of the high-risk, thin-
cap fibroatheromas exhibit intraplaque hemorrhage. In a study of
57 patients who died of coronary artery disease, Virmani et al.48
found extravasated erythrocytes in coronary plaques of 84% of
patients. Recent studies indicate that intraplaque hemorrhage
could also be a trigger, rather than just a marker, of plaque
instability, by playing a major role in plaque progression with
resultant accumulation of erythrocyte membranes, cholesterol
crystal generation and retention, enlargement of necrotic cores,
promoting oxidant and proteolytic activities, leukocyte infiltra-
tion, and inflammation in plaques47, 49–51.
There are several histological features that characterise an
unstable and high-risk atherosclerotic plaque: Thin fibrous cap of
<65 µm (giving rise to the term thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA));
large necrotic core; increased plaque inflammation; positive vas-
cular remodeling; increased neovascularization by vasa vasorum;
and intraplaque hemorrhage43, 45, 52. Despite extensive advances
in the field of cardiovascular medicine and imaging technologies,
the ability for early detection of the high-risk plaques remains
elusive. Several invasive plaque-imaging techniques have been
developed with the aim to detect the various characteristics of
histologically defined unstable plaques (such as TCFA). However,
most of these currently used methods are able to detect only
some, but not all, histological features of unstable plaques.
Using intravascular ultrasound with virtual histology (IVUS-
VH) Stone et al.53 showed the major adverse cardiovascular event
rate for non-culprit lesions, which were classified as TCFA,
exhibiting a plaque burden of >70% and minimal luminal area of
≤ 4 mm2, was 18.2% at 3.4 years follow-up. While this clearly
demonstrates that the use of IVUS-VH has some value in pre-
dicting future adverse cardiovascular events, it is still far from
ideal with a relatively poor predictive value, highlighting its
limitations in detecting all of the histological criteria of unstable
plaques.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) with its high resolution
(10–15 µm) is well-suited for detection of thin fibrous caps,
macrophages and necrotic core but is not well designed for reli-
able detection of positive remodeling or plaque burden43, 54–57.
Fujii et al.58 found that the mean value for minimum fibrous-cap
thickness within TCFAs was 57.4 ± 5.4 µm in 35 MI patients, and
55.9 ± 7.3 µm in 20 stable angina patients (p = 0.4), indicating
that by itself TCFA, detected by OCT, is probably not sufficient to
differentiate low-risk from high-risk atherosclerotic plaques.
Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been shown to be able
to detect lipid core-containing plaques in both, ex vivo and
in vivo studies59–61. Madder et al.62 recently published a study
using NIRS to identify the composition of target lesions in
patients with acute coronary syndrome (28 patients) vs. stable
angina (32 patients). Nearly 50% of patients with stable angina
showed lipid core plaques in this study, casting doubts on its
ability to identify the plaques with high risk for cardiovascular
events.
Other emerging methods including angioscopy (visualizes
surface appearance of the plaque) and thermography (detects
metabolic activity of the plaque) are reporting individual char-
acteristics of atherosclerotic plaques but have not been proven to
provide predictive value yet. Intravascular application of Raman
spectroscopy is also technically challenging due to its low signal-
to-noise ratio and poor tissue penetration63.
Non-invasive MRI has been used to identify intraplaque
hemorrhage and vasa vasorum in the carotid arteries with a
prognostic significance64–66. But MRI of coronary arteries has
been challenging due to their small diameter, deep location in the
chest and their motions with cardiac cycle and diaphragmatic
movements67. Intravascular MRI to image vulnerable plaques,
especially in the coronary arteries, is still at an early development
stage although holding promise to ultimately being able to detect
intraplaque hemorrhage.
NIR fluorescence imaging catheters have been tested in rabbit
models of atherosclerosis without the detection of significant NIR
fluorescence signals unless external fluorophores were used25, 26.
However, it should be noted that these rabbit models and other
animal models of atherosclerosis may not represent unstable
atherosclerotic plaques as seen in our TS mouse model or in
humans. Hence plaques in rabbit and other larger animal models
may not harbor significant areas of intraplaque hemorrhage,
which we see as the central prerequisite for NIRAF (Fig. 8).
Very recently, a pioneering dual-modality OCT-NIRAF (exci-
tation 633 nm and detection between 675 and 950 nm) optical
catheter system has been developed for the investigation of
human coronary arteries68. NIRAF signals were initially descri-
bed by Wang et al.68 ex vivo in plaques of human coronary
arteries characterized by necrotic cores. Ughi et al.69 went on and
elegantly demonstrated NIRAF focally in plaques with high-risk
morphological features in a first study in humans involving
intracoronary fluorescence imaging in 12 patients. Importantly,
these studies support the relevance of our findings and demon-
strate the feasibility and potential of intracoronary NIRAF ima-
ging in humans. The association of NIRAF with the necrotic core
potentially points to intraplaque hemorrhage as a known crucial
factor in plaque progression including enlargement of necrotic
cores49. Based on the broad spectrum of excitation as shown by
us, bilirubin is a potential source of NIRAF at the excitation
wavelength used by the described OCT-NIRAF device68. How-
ever, other sources such as lipids and lipoproteins modified by
oxidative stress could also contribute to NIRAF associated with
high-risk coronary plaques as discussed by Wang et al.68. Nota-
bly, in a recent study, Verjans et al.70 showed only minimal
NIRAF in three human CEA plaques detected by an intravascular
NIRF-OCT system, compared to five subjects who received
Indocyanine Green, a targeted NIRF agent (Ex 740 nm, Em 790
nm). While the higher emission wavelength (750–800 nm range)
may be well suited for targeted NIR fluorescence agents, it might
be less suited for detection of NIRAF, such as successfully
reported at a range between 633 and 700 nm68, 69. Further in vivo
intracoronary imaging studies based on these findings will help to
determine the clinically most suitable NIRAF detection wave-
lengths for the identification of high-risk atherosclerotic plaques.
While clinicians and scientists alike are pursuing to improve
intravascular imaging technologies to identify high-risk plaques,
there are some studies already investigating the feasibility, safety
and efficacy of pre-emptive, prophylactic stenting in potentially
high-risk, but non-obstructive coronary lesions71. However, in

 general implanting stents is not without risks, including death,
MI, emergency bypass surgery, stroke and bleeding as well as
stent thrombosis (acute or late), with a very high mortality rate.
Hence for prophylactic stenting (plaque sealing) of silent, non-
obstructive lesions to become a feasible treatment option, a reli-
able imaging technology is required that has a high predictive
value for the risk of cardiovascular complications.
Although some of the currently available intravascular imaging
modalities or their combination have their own merits and are
able to identify some aspects of high-risk plaques (for example,
lipid core in NIRS, thin cap and monocytes in OCT and plaque
burden in IVUS, etc.)72, none of these technologies is generally
accepted to reliably detect high-risk plaques. We here describe
NIRAF, which characterizes high-risk plaques with intraplaque
hemorrhage both in mice and humans, as such potentially highly
promising technology. We also identify a potential source of
NIRAF, bilirubin; being generated by heme degradation. Our
study demonstrating NIRAF in the areas of intraplaque hemor-
rhage, which is clearly a critical element of plaque instability,
provides a much-needed new foundation in the field of intra-
vascular imaging of high-risk plaques. Fluorescence imaging in
preclinical models can now be used to assess and monitor
potential plaque stabilizing drugs, a technology long sought-after
by the pharmaceutical industry. In humans, the feasibility of
NIRAF measurements to risk stratify atherosclerotic plaques and
thus to provide a basis for decision-making on preventative
treatment will have to be tested in large randomized and con-
trolled clinical trials. Such trials will then have to determine
whether NIRAF quantification holds up to the promise of ulti-
mately making a difference in cardiovascular mortality and
morbidity.
In our study, a cut-off in MFI was used to categorize whether
or not human CEA samples had significant NIRAF. Although this
cut-off was chosen according to a standard dye intensity and
based on comparisons with underlying plaque histology, it is to
some extent arbitrary. Hence, the percentage of samples defined
to be positive for NIRAF is dependent on this cut-off definition.
However, a more meaningful cut-off point can only be defined via
follow-up studies determining the occurrence of adverse cardio-
vascular events correlated to various levels of NIRAF.
The current study describes NIRAF as a feature of athero-
sclerotic plaques that contain intraplaque hemorrhage. Our his-
tological characterization indicates that these plaques are unstable
and prone to rupture. However, this does not exclude that some
plaques without intraplaque hemorrhage and thus without
NIRAF can also cause cardiovascular complications. Ultimately, a
definitive association of NIRAF with cardiovascular risk can only
be made with certainty, if natural history studies with clinical
follow-up are obtained. Such studies are warranted to determine
the clinical relevance of NIRAF for the management of athero-
sclerotic disease and its potential impact on cardiovascular
mortality and morbidity.
Methods
Human and mouse tissue samples. Human CEA specimens were collected
immediately after being taken out at the operating rooms from patients who
presented to the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia with clinical indications for
CEA. The project was approved by The Alfred Hospital Ethics Committee
(approval number 130/11) and all the participants signed the informed consent
form. All animal experiments were approved by the Alfred Medical Research
Education Precinct (AMREP) Animal Ethics Committee (approval number E/
0998/2010/B).
Odyssey infrared imaging system. The Odyssey Infrared Imaging System is a
closed chamber analyzer that was originally designed for the characterization and
quantification of protein bands in gels. It is a bottom up scanning process made
possible by two solid state diode lasers with an excitation at 685 nm in the 700
Channel or an excitation at 785 nm in the 800 channel. The detector uses a silicon
avalanche photodiode with a resolution of 21–337 µm and adjustable focusing
range at 0–4 mm, the scanning speed is between 5 and 40 cm s−1. The dye
IRDye800CW (LI-COR Biotechnology) was used as a standard for comparison. All
figures and fluorescence intensity measurements using the Odyssey Infrared
Imaging System were taken using the 800 nm channel unless specified otherwise.
The fluorescence signals from human and murine samples were analyzed using
Odyssey software version 3.0.30. For NIRAF analysis, samples were typically
prepared fresh. However, paraffin-embedded samples also demonstrated NIRAF.
Settings were adjusted to eliminate background fluorescence for image
presentation. Absolute MFI values were used for statistical assessment. For human
CEA samples, although determined in comparison to IRDye800CWl as a standard
dye and to histological characteristics of plaque instability, a relatively arbitrary
cut-off fluorescence unit of 20 was used to define the presence ( ≥ 20) or absence
(<20) of relevant NIRAF of the samples.
Raman autofluorescence imaging. Raman autofluorescence imaging of tissue
sections was performed on a WITec confocal CRM alpha 300 Raman microscope.
The spectrometer was equipped with a Toptica diode laser operating at 785 nm and
a back illuminated CCD detector, cooled to −60 °C. The laser was coupled to a
microscope via a single mode optical fiber with a diameter of 100 μm and the
typical power at the sample was 5 mW using a ×50 objective. The back scattered
light was focused onto a multi-mode fiber (100 μm diameter) coupling to a 300 line
grating spectrograph. The system was equipped with a long Pass Raman Filter E-
Grade and a Razor Edge Dichroic Beamsplitter with high transmission starting at
65 cm−1. The integration time for a single spectrum was 0.3 s with a spectral
resolution of 3 cm−1. To generate autofluorescence images the integrated area
between 4000 and 150 cm−1 was calculated, which corresponds to integrating the
region between 794 and 1144 nm, when taking into account the Stokes shift from
the 785 nm excitation line. The grating spectrograph was calibrated using the
Raman scattering line produced by a silicon wafer (520.7 cm−1). Following exci-
tation at 785 nm, emission fluorescence of the sample between 794 and 1144 nm
was detected and presented as shown. Because of the strong fluorescence in this
range, no Raman bands were observed and the resulting images represent auto-
fluorescence from the sample.
Resonance raman spectroscopy. Human CEA samples (with or without auto-
fluorescence) and carotid segments of mice that had undergone TS surgery (gen-
erating segments with or without autofluorescence), embedded in “optimal cutting
temperature” compound (Sakura Finetechnical, UK) were sectioned at 5 µm (for
human samples) and 40 µm (for murine samples), respectively using the Leica
CM1950 cryostat (Leica Microsystems Pty. Ltd., Germany). The samples were then
mounted on microscope glass slides (Superfrost-Plus, Thermo Scientific, USA).
Raman signals were obtained at 14 mW with a 413 nm excitation using the
Renishaw InVia confocal micro-Raman system (Renishaw plc, UK) with the
Innova Ar/Kr ion laser 514/413 nm as a laser source. The data were analyzed by
OPUS 6.0 software (Bruker Optik GmbH).
Bilirubin extraction from plaque tissue. The whole extraction procedure was
performed with minimal exposure to light since bilirubin is light sensitive. The
tissue segments were homogenized manually in 1 ml of PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+
in Eppendorf tubes. One milliliter of chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich) was added into
each tube and vortexed vigorously for 30 s. The tubes were then centrifuged at
1000 × g for 10 min. The organic phase was carefully collected and transferred to
new tubes for analysis. The tubes were protected from light with aluminum foil.
The Cary 60 UV–vis Spectrophotometer (Agilent technologies, Santa Clara,
USA) was used to measure bilirubin concentration in the extracted fluid. The
baseline measurements were performed using chloroform first and the absorbance
at 476 nm (representing bilirubin concentration) was measured for each sample.
A protocol used by a routine laboratory for the quantification of bilirubin in CSF
(xanthochromia) was followed73.
Detection of heme, biliverdin and bilirubin by LC–MS/MS. Mouse unstable
(segment I, 1–2 mg tissue wet weight) and stable plaques (segment V, 5–9 mg)
collected at 1, 4 and 7 weeks post-TS surgery were homogenized in 100 or 200 μl
ice-cold PBS (containing 2× protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche Diagnostics),
respectively. Homogenization was performed on ice for 3 min using a 0.2 ml
Potter-Elvehjem micro tissue grinder (Wheaton). Internal standards (2.25 μl of 15
μM meso-bilirubin, 2.25 μl of 1 μM meso-biliverdin and 2.25 μl of 5 μM n-methyl-
protoporphyrin IX) were then added to 50 μl of homogenates followed by 2.25 μl of
0.2 M EDTA. The mixture was mixed for 5 s and then 391 μl of ice-cold methanol
containing 0.2 M EDTA added, the mixture vigorously mixed for 30 s and left on
ice for 5 min. The extract was then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and
5 μl of the resulting supernate subjected to LC–MS/MS analysis using an Agilent
1290 binary pump HPLC couple to an Agilent 6490 triple quadrupole mass
spectrometer.
The pigments and internal standards were separated on a C-18 column (Zorbax
Eclipse Plus C18, RRHD 2.1×50 mm, 1.8 μm) using a gradient of mobile phase A
(59.5% water/40% acetonitrile/0.5% acetic acid) and mobile phase B (7.5% water/
92% acetonitrile/0.5% acetic acid) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min−1. The gradient was

 as follows: 0–100% B over 8 min, 100% B for the subsequent 8 min, returning to 0%
B over 1 min and then equilibrating at 0% B for 3 min. Following separation, flow
was directed into the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with parameters set as
follows: gas temperature = 200 °C; gas flow = 15 l min−1; nebulizer pressure = 35
psi; sheath gas heater = 395 °C; sheath gas flow = 11 l min−1; capillary voltage =
3500 V and nozzle voltage = 1500 V. Pigments and internal standards were
detected by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in positive ion mode using the
above general mass spectrometry parameters with fragmentor voltage set at 380 V
and cell accelerator voltage at 7 V. In each case, the fragment ions generated by
collision-induced dissociation of the [M + H]+ ions were used for quantification.
MRM transitions for the target analytes were: heme (m/z 616.2→557.2) with
collision energy (CE) = 41 V; biliverdin (m/z 583.3→297.2) with CE = 33, bilirubin
(m/z 585.3→299.2) with CE = 17 V; n-methyl-protoporphyrin IX (m/z
577.7→503.3) with CE = 45; meso-biliverdin (m/z 587.7→300.3) with CE = 41 and
meso-bilirubin (m/z 589.7→301.1) with CE = 17. All analytes were quantified
against authentic commercial standards obtained from Frontier Scientific and data
was normalized to tissue wet weight.
FLECT. ApoE−/− mice were placed on a western diet for 13 weeks (6 weeks before
and 7 weeks after TS surgery), as described previously. On the day of imaging, mice
were anesthetized, shaved and imaged in the FLECT scanner (Bioscan, Washington
DC) to obtain 3-dimensional acquisition using a 730 nm excitation laser, 803 nm
filter with 29 slices at 1 mm spacing and 29 source angles per slice. The recon-
struction was performed using 1 mm3 grid with attenuation correction at 1000
iterations to generate the reconstructed three-dimensional image of each scan.
Following the FLECT scan, the Computed Tomography (CT) scan was performed
for each animal using settings of 45 kV, 1500 ms & 360 projections to generate the
anatomical image, which was overlayed onto its respective FLECT image.
Heme and associated products. Tetrapyrole-containing compounds used in this
manuscript were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA): Bilirubin (cat. no.:
B4126), Hemoglobin (cat. no.: H7379), Ferrous stabilized hemoglobin (cat. no.:
H0267), Biliverdin hydrochloride (cat. no.: 30891), Protoporphyrin IX (cat. no.:
P8293), Protoporphyrin IX cobalt chloride (cat. no.: C1900), and Protoporphyrin
IX zinc(II) (cat. no.: 282820).
Fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence images were recorded on a DeltaVision
Widefield microscope (Applied Precision) using a ×60 1.42 NA oil immersion
objective, a Cy5 filter set (excitation: 650/13, emission: 684/24) for Alexa 647
fluorescence and a Cy7 filter set (excitation: 740/13, emission: 809/81) for NIR
autofluorescence. The system is equipped with a Photometrics HQ camera. Images
were recorded with 4 × 4 pixel binning and critical illumination to be able to detect
the NIR autofluorescence signal. Bright field images were recorded along with
fluorescence images. Image processing was performed using the open-source image
analysis software Fiji.
Old and new blood preparation. Fresh whole blood was obtained from mice via
cardiac puncture using 1 ml Terumo syringes with 25 G needles. Heparin was used
as anticoagulant at a total volume of 100 μl (final concentration 20 IU ml−1). For
old blood with and without anticoagulant, blood remained 45 min at room tem-
perature. Syringes with blood were scanned using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging
System at 21 μm resolution.
Immunohistochemistry. The 5 μm cryosections of human CEA samples were
thawed at room temperature for 30 min and then fixed in acetone at −20 °C for 20
min. Samples were sequentially fixed again in 10% neutral buffered formalin at
room temperature for 2 min and absolute ethanol for 10 min to reduce back-
ground. Subsequently, all slides were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min
to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Sections were incubated with normal
rabbit serum for 30 min, followed by avidin and biotin blocking according to
manufacturer’s requirement (Vector Laboratories, CA, USA). After the blocking
steps, the sections were treated with primary antibodies for 1 h. Anti-bilirubin
(clone 24G7, Shino-test, Kanagawa, Japan, dilution 1:100), anti-hemoglobin sub-
unit alpha (cat no: ab102758, Abcam, USA, dilution 1:100) and anti-glycophorin A
(human samples: cat no: ab129024, Abcam, USA, dilution 1:100; mouse samples:
cat. no.: bs8042, Bioworld Technology, USA, dilution 1:100) were used as primary
antibodies to detect intraplaque hemorrhage. Sections were subsequently incubated
with corresponding biotinylated secondary antibodies for 30 min, followed by
incubation with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase system (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector
Laboratories). The reaction products were stained with a DAB substrate kit for
peroxidase (Vector Laboratories) to generate a brown reaction product. Then
sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Negative controls were done
identical to the above protocol, except for incubation with PBS instead of primary
antibodies.
Iron staining based on prussian blue reaction. Iron stain kit from Sigma-
Aldrich, Australia was used for the procedure. The 5 μm paraffin sections of human
CEA samples were deparaffinized and then hydrated with deionised water. The
samples were then treated with Working Iron Stain Solution prepared by mixing
equal volumes of potassium ferrocyanide solution and hydrochloric acid solution.
The slides were then rinsed with deionized water and stained with Working
Pararosaniline solution (prepared by 1 ml of Pararosaniline solution to 50 ml of
water) for 5 min. The slides were rinsed again with deionized water and hydrated
with alcohol and xylene before examining for Prussian blue reaction (bright blue
staining of iron).
IVIS fluorescence scanning of hemoglobin and bilirubin embedded in agarose.
Hemoglobin and bilirubin (50 μg each) were discretely embedded in an agarose
phantom (10% w/v) before imaging in the IVIS Lumina Series II Imaging System
(Caliper Life Sciences, MA, USA). Fluorescence images were obtained by a charge-
coupled device (CCD) camera using the XFO-12 fluorescence equipment with
appropriate filter combinations (excitation filters for 605 nm, 640 nm, 675 nm, 710
nm, 745 nm and emission filter for 810–875 nm). Reflected light photographic
pictures were taken during illumination with white light-emitting diode. Both
fluorescence and photographic images were overlayed, processed and analyzed
using Living Image 4.4 software.
Tandem stenosis surgery. At 12 weeks of age, 6 weeks after commencement of
HFD, ApoE−/− mice (C57BL/6J background) were anaesthetized by ketamine
(80 mg kg−1) and xylazine (20 mg kg−1) mixture through intraperitoneal injection.
An incision was made in the neck and the right common carotid artery was
dissected from circumferential connective tissues. A TS with 150 μm outer dia-
meters was introduced with the distal point 1 mm from the carotid artery bifur-
cation and the proximal point 3 mm from the distal stenosis. The stenosis diameter
was obtained by placing a 6-0 blue braided polyester fiber suture (TI.CRON 0.7
Metric) around the carotid artery together with a 150 μm needle (Ethicon 8-0,
Virgin silk blue, W1782) that was tied to it and later removed. Animals were
euthanized at 7 weeks after surgery.
Statistical analysis. GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla,
CA, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. Unpaired Student’s t-test or
Mann–Whitney U test was used for the comparison of parameters between two
groups in Figs. 2b and 4b. The Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple
comparisons test were used for comparison of parameters among three groups in
Figs. 4c, 7b and c. Parameters were shown quantitatively as mean ± SEM. A p value
of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
