MYC is a major cancer driver but is documented to be a difficult
therapeutic target itself. Here, we report on the biological activity,
the structural basis, and therapeutic effects of the family of multi-
targeted compounds that simultaneously disrupt functions of two
critical MYC-mediating factors through inhibiting the acetyllysine
binding of BRD4 and the kinase activity of PI3K. We show that the
dual-action inhibitor impairs PI3K/BRD4 signaling in vitro and in
vivo and affords maximal MYC down-regulation. The concomitant
inhibition of PI3K and BRD4 blocks MYC expression and activation,
promotes MYC degradation, and markedly inhibits cancer cell growth
and metastasis. Collectively, our findings suggest that the dual-
activity inhibitor represents a highly promising lead compound for
the development of novel anticancer therapeutics.
MYC | bromodomain | BRD4 | PI3K | inhibitor
T
he MYC gene is frequently altered in human cancer. It en-
codes a transcription factor that binds to and regulates nearly
10–15% of genes in the human genome (1–3). The MYC targets
mediate fundamental biological processes necessary for cell sur-
vival and general well-being, ranging from gene-expression and
cell-cycle programs to cell proliferation and response to DNA
damage, thereby establishing MYC as a global transcriptional
regulator. MYC is overexpressed or amplified in many human
cancers, which results in genome instability and deregulation of
an array of signaling pathways responsible for malignant trans-
formation. MYC expression level as well as synthesis, stability, and
posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of the MYC protein are
tightly regulated via several pathways, including PI3K–AKT–
mTOR and RAS–MAPK (4). Particularly, PI3K activation blocks
MYC degradation through inhibiting GSK3β-dependent MYC
phosphorylation at threonine 58, elevating MYC levels and in-
ducing MYC-dependent oncogenic programs (4, 5).
MYC gene expression has recently been linked to the activity of
the BET (bromodomains and extraterminal domain) family of
transcriptional coactivators (6–9). The BET protein BRD4 is found
enriched at MYC and other oncogenes superenhancer and pro-
moter regions, and transcriptional silencing of MYC coincides with
the release of BET proteins from its locus, indicating that BET
proteins can regulate MYC expression (10, 11). BRD4 itself is
linked to multiple human malignancies: It forms chromosomal
translocations in squamous carcinoma and NUT midline carci-
noma, plays a role in progression of acute myeloid leukemia, and is
up-regulated in breast cancer (7, 12–14). BRD4 contains a pair of
bromodomains (BDs) that belong to the family of evolutionarily
conserved structural modules that recognize acetyllysine PTMs in
histones and nonhistone proteins (15, 16). Interestingly, BD1 and
BD2 of BRD4 have distinct acetyllysine binding functions (17). BD1
binds to diacetylated histones, including histone H4 diacetylated at
lysine 5 and lysine 8 (H4K5acK8ac), and this interaction helps to
recruit or stabilize BRD4-containing transcription complexes at
target gene promoters and enhancers. The second BD, BD2, selects
for acetylated nonhistone proteins, though it is also capable of as-
sociating with acetylated histones H3 and H4. In the past few years,
a number of BRD4-specific inhibitors have been developed, with
some showing therapeutic effects in cancer models for NUT mid-
line carcinoma, multiple myeloma, lymphoid leukemia, myeloid
leukemia, and neuroblastoma (7, 8, 10, 12, 18–23).
Because MYC itself has been proven to be a difficult thera-
peutic target, the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway and inhibition of
PI3K kinase activity in particular has been a main focus of drug
development (4, 24). However, inhibition of PI3K to enhance
degradation of MYC provides only a limited therapeutic effect
and is often followed by the development of resistance to the drug
(25). To overcome this problem and enhance efficacy, a combi-
nation of different inhibitors has been used as one of the treat-
ment strategies. For example, combined PI3K and BET inhibition
shows a beneficial antitumor effect in a model of metastatic breast
cancer driven by PI3K and MYC (26). Likewise, BET inhibition
suppresses transcription of a set of kinases, induced by the cancer
drug Lapatinib, and prevents kinome adaptation, leading to a
durable response to Lapatinib (27). A pioneering approach has
been taken more recently to develop small-molecule compounds
that can bind concomitantly to multiple targets, resulting in in-
hibition of more than one pathological pathway. Ciceri et al. have
Significance
In this work, we describe a dual-action inhibitor that simulta-
neously disrupts functions of two key MYC-mediating factors—
PI3K and BRD4. We show that the concomitant inhibition of PI3K
and BRD4 blocks MYC expression and activation, promotes MYC
degradation, and markedly inhibits cancer cell growth and me-
tastasis. Our findings suggest that the dual-activity inhibitor
represents a highly promising lead compound for the develop-
ment of novel anticancer therapeutics.

 screened a library of kinase inhibitors, including clinically ap-
proved drugs, and identified several compounds that interact with
BRD4 with affinity in a nanomolar range (28). Dittmann et al.
show that two compounds commonly used in cell biology assays to
explore PI3K signaling or inflammatory consequences inhibit
acetyllysine binding activity of BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 (29).
Here, we report on the biological activity, the structural mech-
anism, and therapeutic effects of the family of dual-activity inhibi-
tors that simultaneously disrupt the acetyllysine binding function of
BRD4 and the kinase activity of PI3K. The dual-action inhibitor
blocks MYC expression and activation, increases MYC degradation,
markedly inhibits cancer-cell growth and metastasis, and represents
a promising lead compound for the development of novel antican-

Results and Discussion
Morpholinothienopyrane Is a Dual Inhibitor of PI3K and BRD4. We
have previously shown that 5-morpholino-7H-thieno[3,2-b]pyran-
7-one (TP-scaffold) represents a promising class of PI3K inhibitors:
Screening a panel of >200 kinases, we found that SF2523 is a
highly selective and potent inhibitor of PI3K, particularly of the α
isoform of PI3K (PI3Kα) (30). To assess SF2523 activity in the
cellular context, we examined the effect of this compound on the
PI3K signaling pathway in a neuroblastoma SKNBE2 cell line. We
focused on the major established downstream effectors of the
PI3K pathway—AKT and MYCN (one of the MYC family genes
amplified in this cell line)—and evaluated levels and activation of
these effectors. SKNBE2 cells were treated first with IGF and
then with either SF2523 or known PI3K inhibitors, including
SF1126, BKM120, BEZ235, and CAL101, and MYCN mRNA
levels were measured by RT-PCR (Fig. 1A). Whereas all PI3K
inhibitors tested significantly decreased MYCN expression, SF2523
had the most profound effect, reducing the MYCN mRNA level
by ∼sevenfold. Western blot analysis of the SKNBE2 cell lysate
revealed that SF2523 treatment decreases protein levels of
MYCN and Cyclin D1, the MYCN target, and inhibits AKT ac-
tivation by blocking phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 (Fig.
1B). By contrast, other commonly used PI3K inhibitors, such as
BKM120, BEZ235, and CAL101, blocked phosphorylation of
AKT and slightly reduced MYCN levels but did not affect Cyclin
D1 levels, implying that besides the PI3K signaling cascade, ad-
ditional targets of SF2523 likely exist that could also regulate
MYCN expression.
Because MYC transcription has been linked to the activity of the
transcriptional coactivator BRD4 and several kinase inhibitors
have been found to act on BRD4 (28, 29), we tested whether
SF2523 targets BRD4. As anticipated, treatment of SKNBE2 cells
with JQ1, a commonly used inhibitor of BRD4 that has no PI3K
inhibitory activity, resulted in a decrease of MYCN expression and
reduced MYCN and Cyclin D1 levels but had no effect on pAKT,
indicating that JQ1 appears to not alter the PI3K–AKT signaling
(Fig. 1 A and B). Further, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
experiments revealed that JQ1 displaces BRD4 from MYCN
promoter sites (regions 1 and 2 within the MYCN promoter), and
similarly to JQ1, SF2523 treatment led to the displacement of
BRD4 from both MYCN promoter sites (Fig. 1C). Unlike JQ1 and
SF2523, the PI3Kδ selective inhibitor CAL101 was unable to
displace BRD4 from the MYCN promoter.
BDs Are Targets of TP-Scaffold Inhibitors. To determine whether
SF2523 is capable of binding to BDs of BRD4, SF2523 was
tested against a panel of BDs derived from 28 proteins in a
BROMOscan binding assay. As shown in Fig. 1D, SF2523 in-
teracts robustly with the full-length BRD4 (Kd = 140 nM) and
exhibits comparable affinity to the BRD4 first BD (BD1) (Kd =
150 nM), however it binds more weakly to the second BD (BD2)
of BRD4 (Kd = 710 nM). Comparison of binding affinities of
SF2523 for BDs of other proteins revealed that it binds equally
well to BDs of BRD4, BRD2, and BRD3; shows moderate
binding to BDs of CECR2 and BRDT; but associates much
weaker with other BDs (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1). Binding affinities
of SF2523 to BD1 and BD2 of BRD4 were corroborated by Kd
values measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (Fig. 1
E and F). Such strong and selective binding of the PI3K-specific
inhibitor to BRD2/3/4 appears to be unique, as none of the
known PI3K inhibitors tested noticeably disrupted the interaction
of BRD4 with its ligand, polyacetylated histone H4 peptide
(H4K5acK8acK12acK16ac), in a kinase screening assay, whereas
SF2523 had an IC50 of 16 nM (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2). In contrast,
displacement binding assays with H4K5acK8acK12acK16ac peptide
showed that SF2523 is a robust inhibitor of acetyllysine binding
activity of BRD4 BD1 (IC50, 241 nM) and a moderate inhibitor of
BD2 (IC50, 1.5 μM) (Fig. 2 A and B).
The direct binding of SF2523 to BRD4 BD1 was substantiated
by NMR 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence
(HSQC) titration experiments (Fig. 2). Gradual addition of
SF2523 to the 15N-labeled BRD4 BD1 NMR sample caused large
chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) that are indicative of direct
binding (Fig. 2D, Left). A slow exchange regime on the NMR time
scale—that is, disappearance of a set of cross-peaks corresponding
to the free state of the protein and appearance of another set of
cross-peaks corresponding to the bound state—revealed a tight
interaction, corroborating the nanomolar values of Kd and IC50.
In an attempt to increase inhibition potency, a second genera-
tion of the TP-scaffold compounds was tested in displacement
binding assays (Fig. 2B). Of the five compounds tested,
SF2558HA was found to be a slightly stronger inhibitor of BRD4
than SF2523, and unlike SF2523, which exhibits fivefold higher
selectivity for BRD4 BD1, SF2558HA disrupted acetyllysine-
binding function of both BD1 and BD2 almost equally well (Fig. 2
B and C). SF2535 demonstrated an increase of inhibition toward
BRD4 BD2 and was also a potent inhibitor of another PI3K
isoform, PI3Kδ (IC50, 41 nM) (Fig. 2A). In further agreement with
the displacement assay findings, titration of SF2558HA and
SF2535 into the 15N-labeled BRD4 BD1 NMR samples resulted
in similar patterns of CSPs in BD1, with the exception of a pair of
side-chain amide cross-peaks, which are in the slow exchange re-
gime upon binding of SF2523 but are in the fast exchange regime
upon binding of SF2558HA and SF2535 (Fig. 2D). We concluded
that the overall binding mode of the TP-scaffold compounds to
BD1 is conserved; however, characterization of these interactions
at the atomic resolution is necessary to better understand the
differences in selectivity and potency of these inhibitors.
Structural Mechanism for BRD4 BD1 Inhibition by TP Compounds. To
elucidate the molecular mechanism for inhibition of BRD4 BDs
by the TP-scaffold compounds, we cocrystallized BRD4 BD1
with SF2523, SF2535, and SF2558HA and obtained crystal
structures of the complexes. The structure of the BRD4 BD1–
SF2523 complex reveals a characteristic four-helix bundle fold of
BD1, with SF2523 occupying a deep hydrophobic pocket at one
of the open ends of the bundle (Fig. 3A and Table S1). The
morpholino and thienopyrano rings of SF2523 are inserted
deeply in the pocket and lay parallel to the α-helices of BD1,
whereas the benzodioxane moiety of SF2523 is positioned per-
pendicular to the α-helices and oriented toward the ZA loop of
BD1. The carbonyl oxygen in the thienopyrano group of SF2523
forms a hydrogen bond with the amide nitrogen of Asn140 and a
water-mediated hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Tyr97
of BD1. The dioxane ring of SF2523 is restrained through a set
of hydrogen bonds involving Trp81, Gln85, and Asp88 in the ZA
loop of BD1. Side chains of Trp81, Pro82, and Leu92 create a
hydrophobic cage around the benzodioxane group of SF2523,
whereas the side chains of Val87 and Ile146 provide additional
stabilization to the thiophene portion of SF2523 (Fig. 3B). The
base of the binding pocket is lined with a well-defined and

 constrained shell of water molecules. Comparison of the BRD4
BD1 complexes with SF2523 or with H4K5acK8ac reveals that
SF2523 acts as an acetyllysine mimetic: It forms the hydrogen
bond with Asn140, which is conserved in acetyllysine–BD com-
plexes, and does not disturb the signature water shell in BD1
(Fig. 3C).
Structural overlay of the BD1–SF2535, BD1–SF2558HA, and
BD1–SF2523 complexes shows a high degree similarity of the water-
lined binding sites (Fig. 3 D and E). Much like in the BD1–SF2523
complex, the thienopyrano group in SF2535 and SF2558HA is re-
strained via a conserved pair of hydrogen bonds (to Asn140 and
Tyr97 of BD1); however, unlike the dioxane group in SF2523, the
ethylcarboxyl group in SF2535 and the hydroxylamino group in
SF2558HA do not form direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds
with Gln85 and Asp88. Instead, the Trp81 residue in the BD1–
SF2558HA complex (but not in BD1–SF2535) adopts a distinctive

 conformation, allowing for its indole nitrogen to make a tran-
sient hydrogen bonding contact with the hydroxylamino group of
SF2558HA (Fig. 3E). Despite the differences in coordination of the
thiophene substituent, the displacement and NMR titration exper-
iments showed that the three compounds bind to BRD4 BD1 to a
similar extent, suggesting that the morpholinothienopyrano core of
these inhibitors plays a key role in the interaction with BD1,
whereas the thiophene substituent can be varied to provide fine-
tuned selectivity toward BD2.
Intermolecular Contacts of the Thienopyranone Substituents Provide
Selectivity. To gain insight into the binding mode of BD2, we de-
termined the crystal structure of BRD4 BD2 in complex with
SF2558HA. In the complex, the SF2558HA molecule occupies the
acetyllysine-binding pocket with the carbonyl group in the thie-
nopyrano moiety positioned in close proximity to the side chains
of Asn433 and Tyr390 and the morpholino oxygen being within a
hydrogen-bonding distance to the imidazole nitrogen atom of
His437 (Fig. 4A). Of the 18 residues within 5 Å of the bound
SF2558HA compound, 15 are spatially conserved in BD2 and
BD1. However, Gln85 in BD1, which forms a hydrogen bond with
the dioxane ring of SF2523 in the BD1–SF2523 complex, is not
conserved in BD2 (Fig. 4B). The inability of BD2 to form this
stabilizing substituent contact could explain a ∼sixfold decrease in
SF2523 activity toward BD2. On the contrary, Trp81 in BD1,
which forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxylamino group of
SF2558HA but not with SF2523, is spatially conserved in BD2
(Trp374). Although the resolution of the BD2–SF2558HA struc-
ture precluded us to define the orientation of the Trp374 side
chain, the capability of either BD to restrain the hydroxylamino
group of SF2558HA through contact with tryptophan could ex-
plain a comparable activity of SF2558HA toward BD1 and BD2.
In agreement, analysis of chemical shift changes in BD2 upon
binding of the three inhibitors showed that although the majority
of BD2 amide resonances, including resonances of residues that
contribute to the stabilization of the TP-scaffold, were perturbed
in a similar way, residues in the ZA loop of BD2 where Trp374 is
located were perturbed differently (Fig. 4C and Fig. S3).
TP Inhibitor Blocks Tumor Growth, Metastasis, and PI3K/BRD4 Signaling
in Vivo. Recent reports have shown that JQ1 suppresses growth of
neuroblastoma in a set of in vivo models, including orthotopic
transplantation of patient-derived xenografts and the TH-MYC
mouse model (19, 31). To determine the therapeutic effects of the
TP-scaffold inhibitors in aggressive neuroblastoma, we established
an s.c. xenograft model of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma in
immunocompromised mice using the SKNBE2 cell line. Mice
were randomized into two groups when tumors reached ∼100 mm3
after 30 d of tumor implantation. One group was treated with
vehicle (DMSO) and another with SF2523 (50 mg/kg, three times
a week), until tumors were harvested. As shown in Fig. 5A, SF2523
treatment resulted in a significant reduction of tumor volume
compared with tumor volume observed in the vehicle-treated
group. Importantly, SF2523 showed no gross toxicity to the treated

 mice, as there was no notable change in body weight (Fig. 5B).
These data demonstrate that SF2523 is highly efficacious in a high-
risk MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma model.
We next assessed the ability of SF2523 to block PI3K activation
and down-regulate MYCN and Cyclin D1 in vivo. RT-PCR anal-
ysis of MYCN and Cyclin D1 expression in tumors harvested from
mice treated with SF2523 and from untreated animals revealed a
significant decrease in both transcripts (Fig. 5C). Western blot
analysis confirmed that tumors from SF2523-treated mice have
markedly reduced MYCN, pAKT, and Cyclin D1 levels compared
with levels of these proteins in vehicle-treated mice tumors (Fig.
5 D and E). Collectively, these results indicate that SF2523 targets
PI3K-driven and BRD4-driven oncogenic pathways in vivo and in
vitro (Figs. 1 A and B and 5 C–E).
Considering the role of PI3K and BRD4 signaling pathways in
stimulation of tumor growth and metastasis (32–34), we examined
the effects of SF2523 in the orthotopic pancreatic Panc02 carci-
noma using a model for spontaneous lymph node metastasis.
Furthermore, we compared the antitumor activities of SF2523 and
two individual inhibitors combined, JQ1 and BKM120, to un-
derscore the therapeutic benefit of the dual inhibition. For the
spontaneous metastasis model, orthotopic pancreatic tumors were
initiated by implanting Panc02 cells into the pancreas of C57BL/6
mice. At 20 d after tumor implantation, mice were randomized
into four groups. One group (n = 8) was treated with 30 mg/kg of
SF2523 formulated in 15% N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) and
30% captisol. The second group (n = 8) was treated with 30 mg/kg
of JQ1 formulated in 30% captisol and 30 mg/kg of BKM120
formulated in 15% ethanol and 15% cremaphore. The other two
groups (n = 4 for both) were used as controls and treated with
either formulation of 15% DMA and 30% captisol, or 15% eth-
anol and 15% cremaphore. Vehicles or inhibitors were adminis-
tered intraperitoneally, five times a week, until tumors were
harvested on day 35 after tumor implantation.
As shown in Fig. 6 A and B, there was a drastic weight loss in
animals treated with JQ1+BKM120, followed by death of four
mice in this group. In addition, JQ1+BKM120-treated mice
exhibited symptoms of hair loss. In contrast, the SF2523-treated
group showed a very mild reduction in body weight with no
mortality, and vehicle-treated mice showed neither weight loss nor
mortality (Fig. 6 A and B). As expected, we observed a significant
reduction of tumor growth in the Panc02 carcinoma model in mice
treated with both SF2523 and JQ1+BKM120 (P < 0.05; Fig. 6 C
and D). Because the Panc02 model is known to promote metas-
tasis in lymph nodes, we investigated whether SF2523 treatment
blocks metastasis in treated animals. Notably, mice orthotopically
implanted with Panc02 cells in pancreas and treated with SF2523
displayed a marked reduction in regional colonic lymph node
metastasis, and this effect was comparable to the effect of treat-
ment with JQ1+BKM120 (Fig. 6 E and F). Altogether, these re-
sults suggest a high efficacy of SF2523 in controlling spontaneous
lymph node metastasis.
Concluding Remarks
An overwhelming amount of experimental data point to the direct
link between cancer and deregulated PI3K–AKT signaling, ren-
dering this signaling pathway into one of the most studied anti-
cancer targets. Inhibition of PI3K has particularly become a highly
desirable avenue for pharmacological intervention, with dozens of
PI3K inhibitors, including taselisib, copanlisib, pictilisib, buparli-
sib, and others, being in clinical trials and idelasib being approved
for a set of leukemias and lymphomas (4, 35). Although initially
very promising, targeted inhibition of PI3K often suffers from the
development of resistance to drugs. It has also been noticed
that such resistance is associated with MYC up-regulation. This

 observation clearly illustrates that targeting a single protein/
pathway may not provide a long-lasting therapeutic effect because
of the highly heterogeneous nature of cancer, in which multiple
signaling cascades are impaired, and that alternative approaches
with the focus on synergistic inhibition of more than one deregu-
lated or compensating pathway have to be developed. Currently, a
number of clinical trials are ongoing to apply PI3K inhibitors in
combination with other drugs (35).
In this study, we report on multitargeted small-molecule com-
pounds that bind to a pair of distinctive cancer-specific targets. We
describe a highly potent dual-activity inhibitor of PI3K and BRD4.
This compound provides maximal inhibition of the major cancer
driver—MYC—because inhibition of PI3K promotes MYC deg-
radation, and simultaneously, inhibition of BRD4 blocks MYC
transcription. The dual-activity inhibitor is characterized by im-
proved efficacy and toxicity: SF2523 is less toxic to the host or-
ganism in vivo than a combination of an equipotent PI3K inhibitor
and BRD4 inhibitor. Our data demonstrate that the dual-activity
inhibitor blocks PI3K/BRD4 signaling in vitro and in vivo and is
highly potent in controlling tumor growth and spontaneous lymph
node metastasis. Our structural analysis provides atomic-resolution
guidance on further optimization of the TP-scaffold with the goal to
increase anticancer efficacy of the compounds toward these two key
oncogenic signaling pathways.
Methods
Tissue Culture, Cell Lines, and Reagents. The human neuroblastoma cell line
SKNBE2 was obtained from ATCC. The Panc02 cell line from C57BL/6 mice has
been previously described (34). All cell lines were tested for mycoplasma
contamination and grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%
FBS, 2 mM glutamine, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere. All cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat DNA
profiling at the respective cell banks and were maintained as recommended
by the suppliers. JQ1 was a gift from James Bradner, Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute, Boston, MA. BEZ235 and CAL101 were from Selleck Chemicals.
BKM120 was from Novartis. Antibodies specific for AKT and pAKT were
obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Normal rabbit IgG, protein A/G
agarose beads, Cyclin D1, and MYC antibodies were from Santa Cruz Bio-
technology, and anti-BRD4 antibody was obtained from Bethyl Laboratories.
SF2523 and SF2535 were synthesized as described (30), and synthesis of
SF2558HA will be reported elsewhere.
Western Blotting. For Western blots, 2 × 106 SKNBE2 cells were plated in 10-cm
tissue culture dishes and were allowed to adhere overnight. The cells were
then serum-starved for 4 h, stimulated with 50 ng/mL IGF, and used for lysate
preparation after 30 min of treatment with 1 μM JQ1, 5 μM SF2523, 10 μM
SF1126, 1 μM BKM120, 1 μM BEZ235, or 200 nM CAL101. Whole-cell lysates
were prepared using RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche
Molecular Biochemicals). Clarified lysates were resolved in 10% SDS/PAGE,
transferred to PVDF membrane, and probed for different antibodies.
RNA Extraction and RT-PCR. SKNBE2 cells were serum-starved for 4 h, stimu-
lated with 50 ng/mL IGF, and used after 24 h of treatment with 1 μM JQ1,
5 μM SF2523, 10 μM SF1126, 1 μM BKM120, 1 μM BEZ235, or 200 nM CAL101
inhibitors for RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen
RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed using iscript cDNA synthesis kit
(Bio-Rad). Amplification of cDNA was performed with 1× SYBR green
supermix (Bio-Rad) on an CFX96 Real time system (Bio-Rad). cDNAs were
amplified using specific MYCN and Cyclin D1 primers. Primer sequences are
available upon request. Data were normalized to GAPDH.
ChIP. SKNBE2 cells were treated with/without JQ1 (1 μM), SF2523 (2 μM), and
CAL 101 (1 μM) for 24 h and then cross-linked using 1.1% formaldehyde,
washed with PBS, and frozen at –80 °C. Antibody-conjugated beads were
prepared by blocking 50 μL of protein A/G agarose beads with 0.5% BSA (wt/vol)
followed by incubation with 6.25 μg of anti-BRD4 antibody and 5 μg of
normal rabbit IgG. Cross-linked cells were lysed, washed, and sonicated es-
sentially as described (10, 19). Sonicated lysates were supplemented with
Fig. 4.

 Triton X-100 1% and cleared. Aliquots were reverse cross-linked and digested
with RNase A overnight and purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit
(Qiagen) for quantification of input chromatin. Sonicated, cleared chromatin
(15 μg) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibody-conjugated agarose
beads, and beads were washed as in refs. 10, 19. Chromatin was eluted in the
buffer (50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, and 1% SDS), reverse cross-
linked, and digested with RNase A overnight and then purified. ChIP and
input DNA were analyzed by real-time PCR analysis using previously pub-
lished primers against the MYCN promoter region 1, (forward) TTTGCACC-
TTCGGACTACCC and (reverse) TTTGACTGCGTGTTGTGCAG; MYCN promoter
region 2, (forward) TCCTGGGAACTGTGTTGGAG and (reverse) TCCTCG-
GATGGCTACAGTCT; and MYCN-negative region, (forward) TATCACCGTCC-
ATTCCCCG and (reverse) TTGGAGGCAGCTCAAAGACC (10, 19). Fold enrichment
was analyzed by calculating the immunoprecipitated DNA percentage of input
DNA in triplicate for each sample.
Binding and Displacement Assays and Kinase Screening. The IC50 measurements
for inhibition of BRD4 were performed by Reaction Biology using an Alpha
screen assay on a set of His-tagged BDs and tetra-acetylated histone H4 pep-
tide (1–21) (H4K5ac/8ac/12ac/16ac-Biotin) as a ligand. The Kd measurements
were performed by DiscoverX using the BROMOscan technology. PI3K activity
screening and IC50 measurements were performed by Life Technologies
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) using ADAPTA, a fluorescence-based in vitro assay.
ITC. BRD4 BD1 and BD2 were buffer-exchanged into 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5)
supplemented with 1 mM TCEP and 100 mM NaCl via size-exclusion chro-
matography using an S100 column. ITC titrations were performed on the
MicroCal iTC200 system (GE) at 25 °C. BD1 (0.5 mM) was titrated into 15 μM
SF2523, and BD2 (2 mM) was titrated into 60 μM SF2523. Each titration was
carried out until saturation via a series of successive injections (first at 0.2 μL
and the remaining at 2 μL). Binding curves and heat plots were generated
and processed using Origin 7.0 software (OriginLab). Error was calculated as
the SE from at least three separate titrations.
Protein Expression and Purification. The BRD4 BD1 (amino acids 43–180) and
BD2 (amino acids 342–460) constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21
(DE3) RIL in either Luria Broth or M19 minimal media supplemented with
15NH4Cl and purified as GST fusion proteins. Cells were harvested by cen-
trifugation and resuspended in 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) supplemented with
150 mM NaCl and 1 mM TCEP. Cells were lysed by freeze-thaw followed by
sonication. Proteins were purified on glutathione Sepharose 4B beads, and
the GST tag was cleaved with PreScission or thrombin protease.
Crystallization and Structure Determination of BRD4 BD1 and BD2 Complexes.
BRD4 BD1 (amino acids 43–180) and BD2 (amino acids 342–460) were con-
centrated to 9–15 mg/mL in 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) supplemented with
100 mM NaCl and 1 mM TCEP and incubated with two molar equivalence of
SF2523, SF2535, or SF2558HA on ice for 1 h before crystallization. All crystals
were grown via sitting drop diffusion method. Crystals of BD1 in complex
with SF2523 were grown at 4 °C by mixing 800 nL of protein/inhibitor so-
lution with 800 nL of well solution composed of 40% PEG3350 (w/v) and
0.2 M potassium thiocyanate (pH 7.5). Crystals of BD1 SF2558HA and SF2535
complexes were obtained at 18 °C by combining 800 nL of protein/inhibitor
solution with 800 nL of well solution comprised of 25% PEG3350 (w/v), 0.2 M
ammonium chloride, and 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.5). Crystallization of the BD2
SF2558HA complex was achieved by mixing 800 nL of protein/ligand solution
with 800 nL of well buffer composed of 2.5 M ammonium sulfate in 100 mM
Tris (pH 7.5). All BD1 datasets were collected at 100 K on a Rigaku Micromax
007 high-frequency microfocus X-ray generator on a Pilatus 200K 2D area
detector, and diffraction data for the BD2 SF2558HA complex were collected
at 100 K on a “NOIR-1” detector system at the Molecular Biology Consortium
Beamline 4.2.2 of the Advance Light Source (ALS). HKL3000 was used for
indexing, scaling, and data reduction. Solution was found via molecular
replacement with Phaser using BRD4 BD1 [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code
3MXF] or BRD4 BD2 (PDB ID code 2YEM) as search models with waters and
ligands removed. Phenix was used for refinement of structures, and waters
were manually placed using Coot.

 NMR Spectroscopy. NMR spectroscopy was carried out on a Varian INOVA
600 MHz spectrometer outfitted with a cryogenic probe. CSP analysis was
performed using uniformly 15N-labeled BRD4 BD1 or BRD4 BD2. The 1H,15N
HSQC spectra of the BRD4 BD1 and BD2 were collected in the presence of
increasing concentrations of either SF2523, SF2535, or SF2558HA in PBS
buffer, pH 6.8, 8% D2O.
In Vivo Tumor Growth and Metastasis Experiments. For in vivo efficacy studies,
SKNBE2 cells (2 × 106) were inoculated s.c. into nude mice (8 wk old, female,
NSG) in the flank area, and tumor growth was monitored regularly. Tumor
volume was calculated using the following formula: volume = (length ×
width2)/2. When tumors reached a tumor volume of ∼100 mm3 after 30 d of
tumor implantation, mice were randomized in two groups (n = 6 animals per
group) and were treated intraperitoneally with vehicle (DMSO) or SF2523
(50 mg/kg, three times a week) until tumors were harvested.
For spontaneous metastasis, orthotopic pancreatic tumors were initiated
by implanting 1 × 106 Panc02 into the pancreas of syngeneic mice as de-
scribed before (34). After 20 d of tumor implantation, mice were treated
