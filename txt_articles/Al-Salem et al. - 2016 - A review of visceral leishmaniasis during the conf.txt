the conflict in South Sudan and the
consequences for East African countries

Abstract
Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), caused predominantly by Leishmania donovani and transmitted by both
Phlebotomus orientalis and Phlebotomus martini, is highly endemic in East Africa where approximately 30 thousands
VL cases are reported annually. The largest numbers of cases are found in Sudan - where Phlebotomus orientalis
proliferate in Acacia forests especially on Sudan’s eastern border with Ethiopia, followed by South Sudan, Ethiopia,
Somalia, Kenya and Uganda. Long-standing civil war and unrest is a dominant determinant of VL in East African
countries. Here we attempt to identify the correlation between VL epidemics and civil unrest.
Objective and methodology: In this review, literature published between 1955 and 2016 have been gathered
from MSF, UNICEF, OCHA, UNHCR, PubMed and Google Scholar to analyse the correlation between conflict and
human suffering from VL, which is especially apparent in South Sudan.
Findings: Waves of forced migration as a consequence of civil wars between 1983 and 2005 have resulted in
massive and lethal epidemics in southern Sudan. Following a comprehensive peace agreement, but especially with
increased allocation of resources for disease treatment and prevention in 2011, cases of VL declined reaching the
lowest levels after South Sudan declared independence. However, in the latest epidemic that began in 2014 after
the onset of a civil war in South Sudan, more than 1.5 million displaced refugees have migrated internally to states
highly endemic for VL, while 800,000 have fled to neighboring countries.
Conclusion: We find a strong relationship between civil unrest and VL epidemics which tend to occur among
immunologically naïve migrants entering VL-endemic areas and when Leishmania-infected individuals migrate to
new areas and establish additional foci of disease. Further complicating factors in East Africa’s VL epidemics include
severe lack of access to diagnosis and treatment, HIV/AIDS co-infection, food insecurity and malnutrition. Moreover,
cases of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) can serve as important reservoirs of anthroponotic Leishmania
parasites.

 Background
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar, is a
serious and often fatal neglected tropical disease (NTD)
that is highly correlated with war, poverty and failed
health systems [1, 2]. The latest estimates from the
Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 indicate that VL
resulted in 62,500 deaths in the year 2013, following only
malaria as the leading cause of death from parasitic in-
fections [3]. It is further estimated that up to 389,100
cases occur annually, causing 4.24 million disability-
adjusted life years (DALYs) such that VL is the highest-
ranking NTD in terms of disease burden [4, 5]. Beyond
this high level of global morbidity is a huge economic
impact, as well as social stigmatization and other
psychological consequences [6–8]. By some estimates
over 90 % of VL cases are reported in six countries,
namely Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, South Sudan
and Sudan [9].
The East African countries of Sudan, South Sudan,
Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Somalia compose one of
the main geographic areas hardest hit by VL, where it is
mostly caused by Leishmania donovani. Phlebotomine
sand flies are widely distributed across East Africa and
various subgenera have been reported including Phlebo-
tomus, Paraphlebotomus, Synphlebotomus, Larroussius
and Anaphlebotomus [10]. Suspected vectors of L. dono-
vani in East Africa include Phlebotomus (Larroussius)
orientalis, Phlebotomus (Synphlebotomus) martini, Phle-
botomus (Anaphlebotomus) rodhaini and Phlebotomus
(Synphlebotomus) celiae [11, 12]. Furthermore, Leish-
mania donovani has been reported as responsible for
both cutaneous leishmaniasis and mucosal leishmaniasis
in East Africa [13–15].
According to Alvar et al. [5] the annual incidence of
VL in East Africa is between 29,400 and 56,700 cases,
accounting for approximately 15 % of the global cases.
However, these numbers can vary considerably from year
to year due to ongoing political and climatic problems in
East
African
countries,
including
civil
wars,
social
unrest, forced displacements, migration, unusual rainfall
or other climate patterns, poverty and malnutrition, each
contributing to emerging or re-emerging outbreaks of
VL [5, 9, 11, 16, 17]. The VL transmission cycle caused
by L. donovani in East Africa is generally considered to
be anthroponotic (AVL) [18]. The AVL reservoir is com-
prised of humans with active infection from VL or post-
kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis. However, some reports
have suggested that a second zoonotic VL (ZVL) cycle is
also present in some areas, in which dogs or rodents are
also major animal reservoirs [15, 19]. ZVL caused by
either Leishmania infantum or Leishmania archibaldi
has also been observed in East Africa, such as the village
of Barbar El Fugara in Al Qadarif, eastern Sudan, on the
border with Ethiopia [15] (Table 1).
Phlebotomus orientalis is widespread throughout East
African countries and is reported as the major vector for
both AVL and ZVL in East Africa [11, 12, 18, 20]. Phle-
botomus orientalis is correlated with dry seasons and
with the presence of Acacia seyal forests, which are high
abundant vegetation in Sudan and the lowland areas of
Ethiopia [21]. In contrast, Ph. martini is reported in
Uganda, Kenya, Somalia, southern regions of South
Sudan and Ethiopia, where high moisture and relatively
high humidity combine with moderate temperatures
[12]. Phlebotomus rodhaini has been found to be in-
fected with L. donovani in Eastern Sudan and is reported
to be a possible vector for transmission of the disease
between animal reservoirs [22, 23].
Methods
Electronic searches were performed using PubMed and
Google Scholar. Searches were limited to the years
between January 1955 and January 2016. The searches
consisted of three terms used in combination using the
format “Term 1” AND “Term 2” AND “Term 3”. Term
1
included:
“visceral
leishmaniasis”,
“post-kala-azar
dermal leishmaniasis”, “cutaneous leishmaniasis” and
“phlebotomine sand fly”. Term 2 included: “conflict”,
“epidemiology”, “control”, “treatment” and “diagnostic”.
Term 3 included: “South Sudan”, “Sudan”, “Ethiopia”,
“Uganda” and “Somalia”. Articles included in this review
stated clear and obvious methodology and results using
molecular methodology for identification of parasites
and morphological or molecular findings for identifica-
tion of the phlebotomine sand flies. In addition to
PubMed and Google Scholar, VL statistics in East Africa
were also gathered from the World Health Organization

the East African countries.
Epidemiology of VL in East African countries
VL is known to be highly distributed in East Africa, par-
ticularly in Kenya, Uganda, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia
and Ethiopia [11, 16]. Beyond the numbers highlighted
in Fig. 1 additional estimates indicate 30,000 cases are
reported annually in the region, with most cases prob-
ably caused by L. donovani (for most cases the etiologic
agent is not routinely determined through molecular
identification techniques, except for those cases specific-
ally mentioned in the subsections below) [5, 24]. How-
ever, during times of conflict and in some post-conflict
settings VL emerges in large and catastrophic human
outbreaks. As shown in Fig. 1, East Africa’s VL cases
concentrate in the eastern area of Sudan (where the
largest number of cases are found) and across the border
with Ethiopia. According to Alvar [5] the estimated
annual VL incidence in Sudan is 15,700 to 30,300 [5].
Another important area is in the northeast region of
South Sudan where the second largest numbers of cases
are found with approximately 7,400 to 14,200 VL cases
estimated annually along its border with Sudan and
Ethiopia [5]. Additional foci are found in Ethiopia with
an estimated 3,700 to 7,400 VL cases annually [5].
Annual estimates of VL incidence in Somalia are 1,400
to 2,700. Additional foci are located on the Kenyan
Ugandan border and include estimates from 960 to 1720
annual VL incident cases [5].
Sudan and Ethiopia
Sudan reports approximately two thirds of the VL cases
every year in East African countries, with most of them
presumptively caused by L. donovani [25, 26]. Key exter-
nal factors promoting VL in Sudan and Ethiopia include
the environment and natural vegetation, poverty and
crowding, and conflict [5, 24]. The Sudanese states of Al
Qadarif, Sennar, and Blue Nile on the border with
Ethiopia are reported as having a high risk of VL trans-
mission, in part due to the Acacia forests. VL infection
is highly correlated with sleeping under Acacia trees at
night or engaging in night time outdoor activities near
Acacia forests [27]. In addition to the Acacia, in both
Sudan and across the border into the Ethiopian agricul-
tural lowland states of Tigray and Amhara, thousands of
VL cases also occur where large families live in crowded
and poor conditions, frequently with cracked walls or
thatched roofs (conditions favourable for phlebotomine
sand flies) [28–32]. Another major factor with a seven-
fold increased risk is found among people sleeping near
dogs as L. donovani has been found in dogs and wild
mammals in Sudan and Ethiopia [29, 33, 34]. Overall,
social and political forces, especially military activities
and agricultural development projects, are major drivers
of VL endemicity and new epidemics in both Sudan and
Ethiopia [11]. In Sudan a general lack of political will

each region or state within East African countries [5, 27, 35, 36]. The largest affected area in terms of number of cases is the eastern region of
Sudan and neighboring Ethiopia (Area 1), followed by South Sudan (Area 2), Darfur and Western Sudan (Area 3), and Somalia (Area 4), and Kenya
with North East Uganda (Area 5)

 combined with the expulsion of some key aid agencies
in 2009, has created further challenges in controlling VL
in the endemic states of Al Qadarif, Sennar, Blue Nile
and White Nile on Sudan’s eastern border with Ethiopia
[24]. These factors are also exacerbated by human
movements and unrest, depleted health care infrastruc-
tures, and normal seasonal movements of farmers. Com-
pounding the situation and increasing the risk of VL are
current food shortages and malnutrition affecting mil-
lions of people in the region. Also within Sudan but in
areas away from its eastern border similar factors
promote the spread of the disease within the interior of
the country, especially in Darfur and Western Upper
Nile [5, 30, 31], and across its southern border into
South Sudan [9, 21, 24]. Details of the epidemic in South
Sudan are discussed below.
Kenya, Uganda and Somalia
Looking south toward the Rift Valley, major VL disease
foci can be found along the border between Kenya and
Uganda [35, 36]. VL has also been reported as an
endemic disease in Turkana, West Pokot and Baringo in
Kenya, [35, 36]. Furthermore, VL epidemics in Kenya
have been reported in Rift Valley and eastern regions,
specifically
Mandera
and
Marsabit
[37,
38].
The
Karamoja Region (specifically Nakapiripirit) in Uganda,
one of the poorest regions of Uganda, is highly endemic
for VL. In Somalia, the civil war has promoted the emer-
gence of VL within the southern states of Bakool, Gedo
and Bay [17, 37, 39]. Bakool in South Somalia is
particularly known as a highly endemic region for VL
and has experienced several disease outbreaks [31, 39].
In addition, a re-emergence of VL occurred during the
Somalian civil war in Bakool, Gedo and Bay [17, 39] and
has been reported among Somalian refugees in Kenya.
VL human infections in Kenya, Uganda, and Somalia
have been identified through molecular techniques L.
donovani while a few have been diagnosed as L. infan-
tum in Somalia [38, 40–42].
The special case of South Sudan: impact of civil war,
unrest, human displacement and refugee camps
South Sudan exhibits one of the world’s highest concen-
trations of NTDs and malaria. In addition to VL, major
NTDs include human African trypanosomiasis, on-
chocerciasis, dracunculiasis, trachoma, onchocerciasis,
Buruli ulcer, leprosy and intestinal helminth infections
[43]. The long history of civil war in South Sudan has
promoted major epidemics producing thousands of VL
cases as shown in Fig. 2. Briefly, three distinct political
eras have occurred since the civil war broke out and ex-
tending until the declaration of independence of south-
ern Sudan from Sudan. The first era began in 1983
when a civil war started between Southern Sudan and
Sudan, continuing until 2005 when South Sudan signed
a Comprehensive Peace Agreement with Khartoum [44].
The 22 years of civil war between 1983 and 2005 re-
sulted in the forced displacement of more than 4 million
people, as well as one of the world’s worst lethal
outbreaks of VL, claiming approximately 100,000 lives
Fig. 2 Timeline of political unrest and number of VL deaths and cases in South Sudan [15, 38–41]. Between 1983 and 2005 VL claimed approximately
100,000 lives in Southern Sudan. During this time there was also an on-going civil war in Sudan. In 2005 a Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed.
Between 2005 and 2008 an estimated 7,400 to 14,200 VL cases were reported annually in South Sudan. In 2011, South Sudan gained independence from
Sudan and VL cases declined sharply to fewer than 5,000 cases in 2012 and to the lowest level in 2013 when only 2,714 cases were reported in South
Sudan. In 2013 the nation of South Sudan entered into a civil war and experienced a doubling of the number of cases of VL cases in Lankien, Jonglei
State and Malakal in Upper Nile State in 2014 with more than 6,700 cases treated. The exact number of cases between 1983 and 2005 is unknown, but
must have been well over 100,000

 [18, 44]. The second era began in 2005, when due to the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement [44] Khartoum could
no longer offer practical support to South Sudan for the
control of communicable diseases, including VL [43]. As
a result, an estimated 7,400 to 14,200 VL cases were
reported annually, particularly in Upper Nile, Unity,
Jonglei and Eastern Equatoria, prior to the formal dec-
laration of independence in 2011 [43, 45]. Subsequently,
a third era began in 2011, with the South Sudanese
Government allocating resources to overcome commu-
nicable diseases including VL. With tensions reduced in
South Sudan, VL cases declined sharply to fewer than
5,000 cases in 2012 and to the lowest level in 2013 when
only 2,714 cases were reported [45, 46]. Serological diag-
noses using the rK39 rapid immunochromatographic
and direct agglutination tests have been applied to diag-
nose VL cases in South Sudan [45], however, there is a
lack of information regarding specific etiologic agents
identified through molecular methods.
Unfortunately, this period has now ended. The most
recent South Sudanese civil war between groups led by
opposition leader Riek Machar and the South Sudan
military led by President Salva Kiir Mayardit has forcibly
displaced more than two million people either internally
or to neighbouring East African countries since 2013
(Fig. 2) [47]. One estimate suggests that there have been
over 1.5 million displaced refugees, of which 90 % have
migrated to South Sudan states known to be highly
endemic for VL, including Jonglei, Upper Nile, Unity
and Eastern Equatoria [48]. More than 800,000 have fled
to neighbouring countries [48]. The United Nations
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(UNOCHA) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) have
identified malaria and other NTD outbreaks in areas
affected by the civil war and unrest, with VL the most
serious and lethal [18, 45]. MSF recently reported a
doubling of the number of cases of VL cases in Lankien,
Jonglei State and Malakal in Upper Nile State in 2014
with more than 6,700 cases treated compared to just
2,714 cases reported in 2013. With continued conflict,
and resulting human displacement and lack of access to
healthcare or facilities, the situation is expected to
worsen [49], and then spread to neighbouring countries.
The overarching problem in South Sudan since 2013
has four major components (Fig. 3). First those living in
endemic conflict areas lack access to shelter and health-
care and are therefore highly vulnerable to exposure to
phlebotomine sand flies and VL. Second, in some cases
the displaced populations are immunologically naïve
populations migrating into highly VL endemic regions
[37, 50, 51], or conversely South Sudanese refugees flee-
ing VL-endemic areas are establishing new VL-endemic
foci
in
neighboring
countries.
Finally,
malnutrition
resulting from food insecurity is an ongoing risk factor
that is highly correlated with VL [52], and currently,
deadly food shortages are affecting nearly 4 million
South Sudanese according to UNOCHA. This current
level of food insecurity is exacerbated by the current
conflict.
Figure 4 emphasizes the particular concern arising
from the second factor highlighted above, namely the
poignant human tragedy of South Sudanese refugees
fleeing the conflict to neighbouring countries where VL
is already endemic or beginning to emerge, or the poten-
tial for VL-infected refugees to create new endemic foci.
Briefly, approximately 100,000 South Sudanese refugees
fled toward the Northern Kenyan States and Rift Valley
Regions, which are also known to be main foci for VL in
Kenya [36, 38, 53–55]. Sudan has received approximately
200,000 South Sudanese refugees despite its own eco-
nomic crisis and civil unrest [56]. More than one-half of
the South Sudanese migrants that have fled to Sudan
settled in the woodland region of White Nile state,
which has reported high levels VL transmission and
outbreaks [57–59]. In Ethiopia, South Sudanese mi-
grants have fled to refugee camps in the southern com-
munities of Omo Valley and Gambela, which are also
known to be endemic foci for VL. Approximately 20 %
of the total VL cases in Ethiopia, are reported to come
from areas that host more than 300,000 South Sudanese
refugees [30–32, 60].
Fig. 3 The “perfect storm” of conditions leading to VL Epidemics
[35, 45–47]. The overarching problem in South Sudan since 2013 has
two major factors. The first is a large population of naïve individuals
migrating to endemic regions. In this case, migrations usually occur
due to civil unrest leading to the second factor: a breakdown in
infrastructure. This breakdown has led to lack of adequate shelter,
food insecurity and collapsed healthcare systems, which leave
individuals highly vulnerable to exposure to phlebotomine sand flies

 Figure 5 shows a summary of these recent events in
South Sudan, which includes the rise of internal oppos-
ition and forced internal displacement of 1.5 million
people and heightened vulnerability to VL. The external
displacement of 800,000 people to neighbouring countries
is helping to establish new VL foci or re-emerging out-
breaks of VL. There is a dearth of published information
about these events. For instance, anecdotal reports
state VL is emerging among South Sudanese in Ethiopia
[49, 61]. Kenya remains without any written reports
from Kakuma, which is endemic with VL.
Other aspects of VL in East Africa: The added challenges
of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) and
complicating host factors
A major complication of VL is PKDL, which is charac-
terized as a macular, papular, or nodular rash that often
begins at the mouth, and is seen with especially high fre-
quency in East Africa where it can occur in up to 50 %
of treated patients [18, 62, 63]. On the Indian subcontin-
ent, 400 specimens of laboratory-bred Ph. argentipes
have been diagnosed via xenodiagnosis. A quarter of
phlebotomine sand flies fed on PKDL nodular cases, and
a half of surviving phlebotomine sand flies became in-
fected with the Leishmania parasite [63, 64]. Further-
more, an observational study was carried out in Sudan
on an infected boy with nodular PKDL resulting in 25 %
infection of Ph. orientalis that fed on the nodules [63, 65].
Thus, PKDL patients can act as reservoir for VL infection
[66, 67]. As a result, Ph. orientalis sand flies are able to
transmit VL infection from PKDL patients, especially
those in refugee camps where there is increased exposure
to the phlebotomine sand fly [68, 69].
A recent study conducted in India suggested a strong
association between testosterone and PKDL in India
[70]. However, in East African countries PKDL patients
developed disease after receiving inadequate and irregu-
lar antimonial treatment of kala-azar [14, 70, 71]. More-
over, it is hypothesized that PKDL patient lesions are

unrest in South Sudan and neighbouring countries. Consequences include not only forced displacement, but also outbreaks of VL due to the factors
listed in Fig. 3

African countries between 2014 and 2015 [28–30, 34, 36, 42, 43, 48–55].

Djibouti, Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and the states of South
Sudan are shown. Numbers range from 0 to less than 50,000 to over
600,000 and are represented by intensity of color on the map

 linked to sun-exposed areas on the body in East African
countries [72]. UV light is hypothesized to play a role in
parasite persistence and is reviewed elsewhere [71, 72].
Mukhopadhyay et al. [71] state that PKDL could develop
as a result of reinfection or parasite persistence and also
could be explained by a failure of tissue-specific T cell
memory or as a consequence of genetic background
susceptibility.
Treatment choices for PKDL are pentavalent antimo-
nials or liposomal amphotericin B that requires cold
storage [9, 24]. In areas experiencing extreme conflict,
treatments requiring cold storage are unrealistic. There-
fore, pentavalent antimonials that have been licensed in
East African countries are the most common choice
[24]. Patient treatment for both VL and PKDL is further
complicated
by
the
absence
of
reliable
field-based
diagnostics. For example, the rK39 rapid diagnostic tests
that is currently recommended by the WHO for use in
primary health care centres has a lower sensitivity to VL
among East African populations relative to other popu-
lations possibly due to chronic malnutrition with zinc
deficiency among VL and PKDL patients in East African
countries [9, 73, 74]. Other diagnostic tools such as
direct agglutination test, microscopy on bone marrow,
lymph node or spleen aspiration require well-equipped
facilities within the district hospital level which is diffi-
cult to achieve in areas under conflict [9, 18, 75–77].
Diagnostic and treatment tools and algorithms need to
be revised.
Still other major challenges to VL in East Africa are
high underlying levels of HIV/AIDS co-infection and
malnutrition. Treatment failure rates are common in
both populations. [78]. In North Ethiopia 40 % of VL
patients are co-infected with HIV [79, 80]. Moreover, a
serious level of malnutrition has been reported in most
parts of South Sudan, particularly among children.
Because malnutrition is highly correlated with VL, this
situation may lead to additional outbreaks of VL in
South Sudan in the future [17, 52, 81, 82].
Preliminary public health and policy recommendations
Enhanced disease surveillance: an expanded program of
enhanced disease surveillance is urgently needed for VL
and other NTDs
Strengthening the surveillance system amongst displaced
populations, such as refugee camps, will be crucial to
treating current cases and avoiding re-emergence of VL.
Surveillance systems can be applied actively through
clinical investigation and diagnostic tools - although the
diagnostic tools in East African countries are not always
as highly sensitive as when they are used to diagnose
populations from other regions [73]. The fact that
PKDL affects more than half of individuals previously
cured of VL is another concern for maintaining disease
reservoirs. There is an urgent need to improve the diag-
nostic tools required to implement VL screening in
East Africa, to ensure that they are suitable for field
purposes [9, 18, 68, 69, 83, 84]. Since the rK39 immuno-
chromatographic test has significantly lower sensitivity in
East African countries, other diagnostic tools should be
introduced with appropriate clinical investigations for sen-
sitivity and specificity in this population. One option is the
direct agglutination test (DAT), with careful consideration
to the conflict situations and with proper supervision and
quality assurance as described in WHO recommendations
[9, 84–86]. Until a more reliable test is available for use in
these populations, individuals in East Africa with clinical
symptoms of VL and negative rK39 should have their
cases confirmed with DAT whenever possible in order to
accomplish basic active surveillance [9, 35, 74, 87].
Case detection and treatment: enhanced efforts are needed
to increase access to treatment, while parallel efforts are
needed to determine optimal treatment regimens
Beyond surveillance, access to treatment must be pro-
vided when cases are detected (Table 2). The toxicity of
drug treatment, PKDL, malnutrition, HIV co-infection
and collapsed health care facilities are all major issues
facing health care workers providing treatment for VL in
areas under conflict, such as refugee camps within South
Sudan and in neighbouring countries. Pentavalent anti-
monials are licensed in all East African countries and
are the standard first-line medicines for VL [9, 24].
However, adequate treatment with antimonial drugs re-
quires better access to health care services in these
areas [9, 24, 88]. An alternative choice is amphotericin B
deoxycholate and pentamidine [9]. For VL cases with HIV
co-infection it has been reported that miltefosine in
combination with liposomal amphotericin B, followed by
secondary prophylaxis and antiretroviral drugs gives
promising results in treatment response [78]. For cases of
PKDL WHO recommends that pentavalent antimonials
or liposomal amphotericin B should be used in East
African countries [9]. However, increasing resistance to
antimony treatment in more than half of VL patients has
been reported in some areas in East Africa [24]. The oral
drug, miltefosine, has shown promising results to treat

 PKDL and may be considered as an alternative as resist-
ance to antimonials concerns are rising [83].
Vector control: integrated vector control measures must be
implemented in addition to evaluation of new or existing
technologies, including insecticide-treated bed nets
Traditional methods of vector control work. It is import-
ant to fill gaps and cracks in building walls with lime
plaster, mud or cement as living in the houses with
cracked walls increases the possibility of contracting VL
infection as consequences of increased exposure to
phlebotomine sand fly bites [28]. A case control study
carried out in north-western Ethiopia showed both
cracked house walls and cracked black soil near houses
boosted risk of transmission with an odd ratio of 2.768
and 6.266, respectively [28]. Additionally, use of bed nets
and also the traditional habit of incense-burning plants
will reduce bite exposures inside houses [28]. Impreg-
nated materials, such as insecticide-treated bed nets
(ITNs) and curtains offer alternative solutions to reduce
the abundance and activity of phlebotomine sand flies
inside and around residential houses [89, 90]. Two thirds
of kala-azar cases have been reduced after insecticide
impregnation
bed-nets
applied
in
Bangladesh
[89].
Lambda-cyhalothrin impregnated bed nets were supplied
to two villages in Dinder National Park, Sudan and were
found to be protective, reducing VL cases by 59 % [91].
Furthermore, Ritmeijer et al. [92] suggest that the effi-
ciency of ITNs is depends on behavioural factors, which
vary among different communities. Fine-mesh ITNs
were very effective when introduced in highly endemic
areas in Eastern Sudan using pyrethroid, with an esti-
mated 60 % reduction of VL cases after ITN interven-
tion [92]. Additionally, repellent gives high protection
from Ph. orientalis as described by MSF-Holland [79].
Multilateral initiatives: several multilateral initiatives related
to eliminating VL and other NTDs in South Sudan and other
East African countries are underway and require
unprecedented commitments. Cessation of current
hostilities would enhance the success of these programs
Today, VL is an integral component of the ongoing hu-
manitarian tragedy in East Africa. The most recent
World Health Assembly (WHA) resolution specifically
directed at intervening against VL is WHA 60.13
adopted in 2007. In 2013, WHA66 re-emphasized the
importance of the global control, elimination and eradi-
cation of all NTDs. At the end of 2014 several African
countries, including Sudan and South Sudan, signed the
Addis Ababa NTD Commitment, in which each country
pledged to enhance efforts to ensure that WHO goals
for NTD control, elimination and eradication by 2020
are met. The commitment includes guaranteeing the
implementation of NTD programs that contribute to
strengthening the overall health system, increasing do-
mestic contribution to NTD programs, improving na-
tional coordination of NTD program goals, and timely
reporting and use of NTD program data. In line with
these goals, South Sudan recently launched a master
plan to eliminate NTDs over the next five years from
2016–2020. Success of this plan will rely heavily on
international cooperation and a de-escalation of the
current civil upheaval.
In 2011 WHO brokered a deal with Gilead, the manu-
facturer of AmBisome (liposomal amphotericin B), for
the donation of 445,000 vials to countries including
Ethiopia, Sudan and South Sudan, to treat over 50,000
VL patients through 2017. While this was a great contri-
bution to the fight against VL, its impact will be modest,
as there are currently hundreds of thousands of cases of
VL and millions of people at risk. MSF is calling for a re-
duction in the price of liposomal amphotericin B to ac-
celerate its rollout to more patients.
Other international commitments to fight NTDs in
South Sudan are also currently underway. The United
States Agency for International Development works with
RTI International, the government of South Sudan and
Ministry of Health, and a wide range of stakeholders to
implement an NTD program in the region since 2008.
In a recent partnership the Drugs for Neglected Diseases
initiative (DNDi), the British Department for Inter-
national Development, the London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine, Mott McDonald and MSF
launched the Consortium for the Control and Elimin-
ation of VL, known as KalaCORE, which focuses its
efforts in high-prevalence countries in South Asia and
East Africa. This new effort complements the Leishman-
iasis East Africa Platform (LEAP) founded by DNDi in
2003 in collaboration with international stakeholders to
strengthen capacity against leishmaniasis in the region.
Strengthened health systems
South Sudan’s current civil war crisis has destroyed its
health care infrastructure. There is an eerie resemblance
to the collapse that preceded Ebola outbreaks in Guinea,
Liberia and Sierra Leone. Attacks have destroyed hospi-
tals that for decades have provided care for VL, HIV/
AIDS, tuberculosis, malnutrition and other diseases and
conditions. Such attacks are not new, and are in clear
violation
of
International
Humanitarian
Law.
On
December 11, 2015, MSF called for an increased hu-
manitarian response to the current conditions in South
Sudan, including relief of malnutrition and increased
access to health care. This statement echoed the senti-
ments expressed by the Secretary General of MSF,
Jérôme Oberreit, the year before, when he also called for
parties to the conflict to ensure that all people in South
Al-Salem et al. Parasites & Vectors  (2016) 9:460 
Page 8 of 11
 Sudan are able to seek health care without fear of
violence.
Other important issues related to VL infection that
must be addressed are malnutrition and the cost of
treatment. Currently, the UN World Food Program is
severely underfunded, making it difficult to provide the
nutritional assistance that is necessary in South Sudan
and other areas affected by hunger. In terms of treat-
ment cost, a 2013 study of the economic cost of VL in
Sudan (the only one of its kind so far for East Africa)
showed significantly high costs for both health care pro-
viders and affected households [93]. This high economic
burden was found to be mostly associated with the high
cost of the pentavalent antimonial used as first-line
treatment and the long treatment course of 30 days
required for effective treatment [93]. Food costs during
treatment were also found to be an important contribu-
tor to the high cost of treatment for households [93].
Utilizing alternative treatment strategies, such as those
mentioned above, which can reduce total treatment
time, may help reduce the economic burden until a
more cost effective solution, such as a vaccine against
VL, is available.
Recently, the United Nations included a target to end
NTDs by 2030 in the Sustainable Development Goals, a
clear global acknowledgement of the effect that NTDs
have on overall human development. Now it is up to
individual countries and international aid organizations,
both governmental and non-governmental to fully com-
mit to this goal. For VL in South Sudan and the rest of
East Africa, in addition to research, disease surveillance
and vector control, achieving this goal will involve
national and international political will to end the on-
going violence, relieve current food insecurity, and
strengthen the overall health care system in the region.
Conclusions
We find a strong relationship between civil unrest and
VL epidemics which tend to occur among immunologic-
ally naïve migrants entering VL-endemic areas and when
Leishmania-infected individuals migrate to new areas
and establish additional foci of disease. Further compli-
cating factors in East Africa’s VL epidemics include
severe lack of access to diagnosis and treatment, HIV/
AIDS co-infection, food insecurity and malnutrition.
Moreover, cases of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis
(PKDL) can serve as important reservoirs of anthropo-
notic Leishmania parasites.
