Abstract
Background: Although the scientific community has acknowledged modest improvements can be made to weight
status and obesogenic behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary/screen time, diet, and sleep) during the school year,
studies suggests improvements are erased as elementary-age children are released to summer vacation. Emerging
evidence shows children return to school after summer vacation displaying accelerated weight gain compared to the
weight gained occurring during the school year. Understanding how summer days differ from when children are in
school is, therefore, essential.
Discussion: There is limited evidence on the etiology of accelerated weight gain during summer, with few studies
comparing obesogenic behaviors on the same children during school and summer. For many children, summer days
may be analogous to weekend days throughout the school year. Weekend days are often limited in consistent and
formal structure, and thus differ from school days where segmented, pre-planned, restrictive, and compulsory
components exist that shape obesogenic behaviors. The authors hypothesize that obesogenic behaviors are
beneficially regulated when children are exposed to a structured day (i.e., school weekday) compared to what
commonly occurs during summer. This is referred to as the ‘Structured Days Hypothesis’ (SDH). To illustrate
how the SDH operates, this study examines empirical data that compares weekend day (less-structured) versus weekday
(structured) obesogenic behaviors in U.S. elementary school-aged children. From 190 studies, 155 (~80%) demonstrate
elementary-aged children’s obesogenic behaviors are more unfavorable during weekend days compared to weekdays.
Conclusion: In light of the SDH, consistent evidence demonstrates the structured environment of weekdays may help
to protect children by regulating obesogenic behaviors, most likely through compulsory physical activity opportunities,
restricting caloric intake, reducing screen time occasions, and regulating sleep schedules. Summer is emerging as the
critical period where childhood obesity prevention efforts need to be focused. The SDH can help researchers understand
the drivers of obesogenic behaviors during summer and lead to innovative intervention development.

 Background
In the United States (U.S.), the prevalence of obesity
among children aged 6–11 years has increased substan-
tially in the last five decades [1], with the most recent es-
timates indicating 31.8% of children and adolescents
aged 2–19 years are classified as either overweight or
obese [2]. Children who are overweight or obese are at
an increased risk for developing non-communicable dis-
eases [3], thereby establishing childhood obesity as an
immediate public health concern [4, 5]. Intervention
strategies targeting obesity prevention among youth have
focused primarily on four obesogenic behaviors: increas-
ing physical activity (PA), decreasing sedentary/screen
time, and improving dietary intake and sleep length and
patterns. There is consistent evidence that these behav-
iors, alone or in combination, are associated with un-
wanted weight-gain in children [6–9].
The majority of the literature describing or intervening
on ‘obesogenic behaviors’ of youth has been conducted
during the 9-month school year, hereon referred to as
‘school’. The rationale for this is straightforward – over
90% of youth in the US attend public or private schools
for approximately 6 h each day, 180 days of the year [5].
However, a number of recent studies consistently show
that when children return to school after summer they
display accelerated weight gains compared to the weight
gain occurring during the school year [6, 10–15]. In
addition, children display a loss in cardio-respiratory fit-
ness (CRF) over the summer compared to the school
year [16, 17]. These negative health outcomes are more
pronounced in children who are already overweight or
obese, of ethnic minority, and from low socio-economic-
status (SES) households [11].
Investigations into the causal factors associated with
the accelerated weight gain and loss in CRF during sum-
mer are limited and report mixed findings [13, 18, 19].
Studies report that children are more active [19], while
others report they are less active during summer com-
pared to school [13]. Studies report children have higher
screen time during summer compared to school [18, 20],
have less favorable diets or similar dietary intake during
summer compared to school [13, 19], and sleep either
the same amount [18] or slightly less [21] during sum-
mer compared to school. These studies were limited by
study-design
(e.g.,
between-subjects),
definitions
of
“summer” (e.g., summer, winter, and holiday break data
combined), obesogenic behavior assessment (e.g., self-
report measures), and/or sample size (e.g., repeated mea-
sures on 14 children). These limitations prohibit the un-
derstanding of the causal factors associated with the
occurrence of accelerated weight gain during summer.
Although convincing evidence documents the acceler-
ated weight gain and loss of fitness during summer,
there is currently a lack of frameworks or working
hypotheses articulating the substantive differences be-
tween summer versus the school year that may lead to
negative health outcomes. Conceptually, a fundamental
difference in a child’s day during the school year versus
summer is the presence of a consistent, structured, less
autonomous (compared to summer), and segmented day
with adult supervision. School days are an example of an
ever-present structured environment with purposive,
segmented, restrictive, and compulsory components.
Conversely, summer days, for the most part, can be
viewed as an environment with less formal structure and
a higher degree of open-endedness. Subsequently, a
more autonomous environment (e.g., summer) provides
children with greater choice and the environment within
which greater choice may exist – such as the home en-
vironment – has both physical and social aspects that
can negatively influence a child’s weight status, particu-
larly in children from low-income households [22, 23].
On the contrary, it must be noted that children are not
without choice during more structured and regulated
environments, like a school day; and research shows
how children will select the less-healthful option (e.g.,
unhealthy snack), knowingly so [24], in light of a more
health-enhancing option [25].
In absence of a extensive literature base to draw from
that investigates summer and school differences, we
propose that a day during the summer can be consid-
ered analogous to a weekend day during the school year.
Although weekends are shorter in duration in compari-
son to summer, they possess similarities in that children
are largely free from segmented, restrictive, and compul-
sory daily components (compared to what school de-
mands) and allowed to make more autonomous choices
in their behaviors. Thus, identifying children’s obeso-
genic behaviors during a less-structured day (weekend
day) during the school year and comparing this in rela-
tion to a structured day (weekday) might shed light on
what occurs over the summer. Further, it is plausible
that, in comparison to school, a more autonomous and
unhealthier home environment operates, and, thus, allows
children to self-select and indulge in a variety of unhealthy
behaviors of which, compounded over an uninterrupted
3-month period, results in adverse health outcomes (e.g.,
accelerated weight gain) that are not manifested during
weekends during the 9-months of the school year due to
the shorter duration of this time period.
In this debate article, the authors put forward the
‘Structured Days Hypothesis’ (SDH) which is founded
on the premise that a structured day (represented herein
by a school day), defined as a pre-planned, segmented,
and adult supervised compulsory environment, plays an
overall protective role for children against obesogenic
behaviors, and, ultimately, prevents the occurrence of
negative health-outcomes, in this case excessive weight

 gain and loss in CRF. Equally, the absence of ‘structure’
to summer days could be one of the reasons children re-
turn to school, after summer break, with accelerated
weight gain and decreases in CRF. Within the confines
of the SDH, the authors present the scientific evidence
on PA, sedentary/screen time, diet, and sleep in relation
to the larger literature base that compares weekdays ver-
sus weekend days – two contexts considered structured
and less-structured environments, respectively.
The ‘structured days hypothesis’ (SDH)
In the SDH, it is hypothesized that the consistent pres-
ence of structure, routine, and/or regulation within a
day positively shapes the obesogenic behaviors of youth.
It must be noted that structure, regulation, and/or rou-
tine is neither a novel concept nor a new experience for
children, as children are exposed to such traits on a day-
to-day basis for the majority of the calendar year (i.e., a
school day). Further, the SDH draws from concepts
found in the ‘filled-time perspective’ which is based on
the principal that time filled with favorable activities
cannot be filled with unfavorable activities [26]. This ap-
plies to the SDH where structure, routine, compulsory,
and/or regulation – common characteristics of a school
day – fills children’s time with ‘favorable activities’ such
as scheduled PA opportunities (e.g., school PE, recess)
and regulated caloric intake (e.g., school meal programs)
and set meal/snack times. Figure 1 illustrates a concep-
tual model of the SDH. During summer, the SDH
proposes there is less structure, routine, and/or regula-
tion, and more autonomy for children during summer
afforded in the home environment. This leaves more
time that can be filled with unfavorable activities/behav-
iors that are more prevalent in the home environment,
such as extended periods of sedentary/screen time and/
or liberties to choose when, what, and how much to eat/
drink [22, 23, 27]. Importantly, during less-structured
environments unfavorable activities can displace favor-
able activities (e.g., children choose sedentary pursuits
over PA) and co-occur (e.g., snacking whilst watching
TV). In addition, structured days (i.e., a school day) pro-
vide all children with opportunities and exposure to
more favorable obesogenic behaviors (e.g., PA opportun-
ities, restricted screen time), and a lower degree of child
autonomy (e.g., limited eating occasions and choice of
foods/beverages) compared to less-structured days (i.e.,
a summer day). Using the school day as an example of a
structured environment, the proposed mechanisms for
how the SDH operates across PA, sedentary/screen time,
sleep, and diet, are detailed below. A summary is also
provided in Table 1.
1. Physical Activity: The authors hypothesize school
days (i.e., typical weekday) are fundamentally different
from less-structured days, such as a weekend day or
summer days, due to the fact that they consistently
contain a daily structure and routine with intentional
(e.g., recess, physical education, before/after school
Fig. 1 Structured day hypothesis conceptual model
Brazendale et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2017) 14:100 
Page 3 of 14
 programs, organized sports programs) and
unintentional (e.g., regular transitions between
activities, walking to school) PA opportunities
provide to the majority of children through the
school day [28]. For example, a child may be
exposed to all or a combination of some of the
following on a school day; a morning commute to
school, recess, physical education, lunch recess,
after school program or activity, organized sport
program, and a commute home from school [29].
Hypothetically, during less-structured days there
may be less daily pre-planned PA opportunities
for children, and the less-structured nature of the
day itself reduces the occurrence of unintentional
PA opportunities. Further, increased autonomy
during less-structured days may allow children to
choose to sedentary pursuits over physical activity
(displacement).
2. Sedentary/Screen Time: The authors hypothesize
the routine structure of a school day limits the
amount of time children can spend sedentary, such
as when watching TV or playing video games.
Although children can spend a large amount of time
sitting during the school day, bouts of time spent
sedentary are broken-up by transitions during the
segmented day and by planned opportunities where
minimal sedentary time can occur (e.g., physical
education, recess) [30]. Conversely, during less-
structured days – where there may be less regulation
or restriction –children may be exposed to increased
unsupervised and open-ended periods of time where
they are free to indulge in sedentary activities, such
as TV viewing and playing computer games [11, 12].
In addition, co-occurring unfavorable behaviors are
freer to operate, such as snacking whilst watching TV.
3. Sleep: The authors hypothesize the presence of the
structured school day plays a role in minimizing the
shift of bed/wake times. Specifically, children are
going to bed earlier and waking earlier during school
days, which studies have found is more beneficial to
a child’s weight status than a late bedtime/late
waketime [31]. For example, on a night that precedes
a school day there is more likely to be a consistent
bed-time and corresponding wake-time, followed by a
typical morning routine (i.e., structure). This is
incidentally enforced as a result of the presence
of the school day. During a less-structured day,
such as summer, there may be less structure in a
child’s morning and evening periods; where
children may be given more freedoms to stay up
later in the evening and wake later in the morning.
The later bed and wake times displace time that could
be spent engaging in favorable obesogenic behaviors
such as sleep in the evening, and PA in the morning,
respectively.
4. Diet: The authors hypothesize children have limited
opportunities to eat/drink during the school day [12]
and access to regulated food programs [11, 15] that
provide nutrient dense meals that meet existing federal
nutrition guidelines [32]. Conversely, less-structured
days (e.g., weekend day, summer day) may be giving
children increased opportunities to snack and access to
unhealthier foods in the home. As summer may
present an open-ended and autonomous environment

Earlier bed/wake times
• Parent/Guardian enforces earlier bed/wake
time rules on school days
• Child is awake earlier to engage in morning
intentional and unintentional PA
• Early bed time reduces child engagement in
sedentary/screen time
Diet
Structure of school day limits eating
occasions for children. Schools offer
regulated access to nutrient dense
meals.
Decreased access to unhealthy
foods/beverages and reduced
overconsumption
• Scheduled opportunities to consume foods/
beverages in school (e.g., breakfast, recess, lunch).
• NSLP serve nutritionally balanced, age-appropriate
portions.

 for children, other factors could drive increased energy
intake during summer such as increased snacking of
calorie-dense low nutrient foods whilst engaging in
screen time activities for extended periods of time
(co-occurring behavior) [33, 34].
To support these hypotheses, a systematic search fol-
lowing the PRISMA guidelines [35] of published studies
reporting week day and weekend day obesogenic behav-
iors of elementary-age children ages 5 to 11 years was
conducted. A separate search, using PubMed, Google
Scholar, and Web of Science, was performed for each of
the
following
obesogenic
behaviors:
PA,
sedentary,
screen time, sleep, and diet. The following key words
and/or search terms were used: “physical activity” seden-
tary*, screen*, television*, sleep*, diet*, nutrition*. Each of
these individual terms were followed by weekday* week-
end* and child*. Studies were excluded if they investi-
gated a different population (e.g., adolescents, adults,
children with disabilities), did not report weekend versus
weekday outcomes, and/or were not published in English.
Studies reporting outcome data of children that incorpo-
rated other ages outside 5–11 year old range were in-
cluded as long as data were segmented by age group/
category. Included studies were stratified by country (U.S.
or International) and whether or not a statistical test was
carried out on the difference between the weekday and
weekend day outcome (statistical test or no test). Studies
showing statistically significant (as defined within each
study) favorable outcomes (e.g., increased PA, reductions
in sedentary/screen time, earlier bed/wake times, and
lower consumption/frequency of consumption of un-
healthy foods/drinks) during weekdays (i.e., structured
days) compared to weekend days (i.e., less-structured
days) were classified as for the SDH. If a study reported
outcomes that did not align with the above criteria
(e.g., Weekend days more favorable than weekdays or
no difference) was classified as against the SDH. Table
2 presents the number of studies found, excluded, and
if the weekend day versus weekday outcome was for or
against the SDH.
Results
In total, 867 studies were screened for inclusion. Based
on the exclusion criteria, 677 studies were removed be-
cause of sample population (n = 454), omission of a
weekend vs weekday outcome (n = 198), or not pub-
lished in English (n = 25). Of the remaining studies in-
cluded for assessment (n = 190), there was no indication
of patterns or groupings for studies that were catego-
rized as either for or against the SDH in terms of study
characteristics (e.g., method of obesogenic behavior
measurement, sample size, country/continent of origin).
Physical activity
A total of 91 studies reported weekend day and weekday
PA estimates, with 18 originating from the U.S. [36–53].
Of these, 81% reported findings supporting the SDH.
Two recent U.S. based studies employing objective mea-
sures of PA concluded that accumulated MVPA was
higher on weekdays compared to weekend days. The
first study explored 187 2nd and 3rd grade children’s
(48.7% boys) MVPA on weekdays and weekend days
using 5 days of accelerometer assessment. The authors
reported that children’s MVPA was greater during week-
days
(46.0
min/day)
compared
with
weekend
days
(37.7 min/day) [36]. Another accelerometer-based study
examined disparities in MVPA among overweight and
obese 3rd – 5th grade children. Children classified as
Overweight or Obese accumulated 11 min less of MVPA
on weekend days compared with weekdays (p < 0.05)
[37]. Similar trends have been found in the PA literature
when using different objective measures of PA (e.g., pe-
dometers [43, 44, 49]), self-report measures of PA [50],
and investigating girls PA patterns [39, 54]. Further, a
meta-analysis
of
objectively
measured
PA
revealed
school-aged children are more active on weekdays than
weekend days (+14 MVPA min/day) [42].
Seventy three international studies were identified
that report weekday and weekend day differences in
PA [29, 55–120]. Of these studies, ~80% drew similar
conclusions to the U.S literature, with 39 of these studies
showing PA was lower on weekend days compared to
weekdays reporting a statistically significant difference.
One cohort study (N = 704) investigating seasonal vari-
ation in children’s PA was conducted in the United
Kingdom (UK) and reported that across all seasons, accu-
mulation of MVPA was higher on weekdays compared
with weekend days [55]. The authors suggested that PA
during weekday is less likely to vary as the school day –
and its corresponding daily PA segments – are less likely
to be influenced by seasonal changes, whereas weekend
days are more susceptible to influence due to the
volitional nature of PA opportunities. Another study
measuring PA levels via accelerometry in a large sample of
11-year old children (N = 5595) found weekdays to be
more active than weekend days (+31 cpm) [29], and other
accelerometer-based studies conducted across different
continents (e.g., Canada [56], Sweden [57], and Singapore
[58]) in varying samples of elementary school-aged chil-
dren (N ~ 80 to 1300) report MVPA is higher on week-
days compared to weekend days.
Sedentary/screen time
A total of 62 studies were identified reporting either sed-
entary and/or screen time estimates for elementary
school-aged children. Of these 62, ~18% of studies were
conducted in the U.S. [30, 39, 46, 47, 121–127], with the

 remaining studies from other countries [63, 65, 67, 72,
73, 77, 79, 89, 93–95, 99–101, 103, 104, 106, 108, 111,
112, 115, 118, 128–149]. The majority of the sedentary/
screen time estimates reported in the literature came
from self-report measures (e.g., surveys, questionnaires,
recalls). An early U.S. study analyzed TV viewing data
from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID; 1997),
collected using 24-h time diaries completed by the pri-
mary caregiver (i.e., parent/guardian). The analysis of
~1000 boys and girls (6–12 years) reported TV viewing
increased on average by 60 min per day during weekend
days compared to weekdays [121]. Another study re-
ported that during weekdays 82% of children (N = 245;
6th to 8th grade) watched ≤2 h per day of TV (screen
time recommendation for US children) compared to
76% of children on weekend days during school [122].
This finding is in agreement with several other studies
conducted outside the U.S. [101, 134, 142, 150–152]. For
example, Jago et al. (2014) examined survey data from
parents of 5–6 year old children (N = 1078) on several
screen time behaviors (e.g., TV viewing, computer use,
videogame consoles). The percent of children spending
≥2 h per day engaged in screen time increased by ap-
proximately 34% during weekend days compared to
weekdays
[134].
Another
study
of
approximately
15,000 children across multiple European countries re-
ported 52% of the sample engaged in ≥2 h per day of
screen time on weekend days compared to 20% on
weekdays [140].
Twenty six studies reported the amount of time chil-
dren spend sedentary comparing weekdays versus week-
end days using objective measures (e.g., accelerometers,
pedometers etc.). Atkin et al. (2016) analyzed seasonal
data of 700 elementary school-aged children from a UK
cohort study and reported increased sedentary time on
weekend days compared to weekdays in 3 out of the 4
seasons (range; 9–54 additional sedentary minutes per
day on weekend days) [55]. Another study explored in-
school versus out-of-school sedentary time patterns of
206 5th grade children across 10 elementary schools in
Colorado. The authors concluded children spent more
time sedentary during weekend days (+5% of wear time)
compared with weekdays [30]. In agreement, additional
accelerometer-based studies from Canada [130, 132] and
the United Kingdom [65, 108] concluded children spend
statistically significantly more time sedentary on week-
end days versus weekdays. Fifteen of the 62 studies
found no difference in sedentary/screen time between
weekend days and weekdays – or reported weekend days
were less sedentary than weekdays.
Sleep
A total of 22 studies reported bed and wake times for
elementary school-aged children during weekdays and
weekend days. Of these studies, ~27% were conducted
within the U.S. [153–158], with the remaining 73% ori-
ginating from other countries [159–174]. One of the
earliest U.S. studies conducted by Blader and colleagues
had parents of 978 5–12 year old children (85% Cauca-
sian) complete a 48-item survey. The authors reported
weekend bed/wake-times were 45–60 min later com-
pared to weekdays [153]. A more recent study explored
a large nationally representative sample of 3–18 year old
U.S. children (N = 2281) and reported a clear shift in
sleep time, with children going to bed and waking later
on weekend days compared to weekdays across the
range of ages [154]. Studies conducted outside the U.S.
show similar bed/wake time patterns between weekdays
and weekend days. Gulliford et al. (1990) conducted a
cross-sectional study of British school children (N = 5145)
whereby parents reported their child’s bed/wake-times
[159]. The authors concluded children were going to bed
and waking later on weekend days compared to weekdays
starting at the age of 5 years old onwards. Several other
international studies incorporating larger sample sizes
(N > 15,000) and parent-report measures show similar
findings [164, 165, 171], as do studies incorporating ob-
jective measures (e.g., accelerometers) to estimate bed/
wake times [163, 170, 174].
Diet
Fifteen studies reported elementary school-aged chil-
dren’s dietary behaviors between weekend days and
weekdays, with eight of these studies conducted in the
U.S. [34, 175–181] Findings across U.S. based studies are
consistent; children display statistically significant un-
favorable diets on weekend days compared to weekdays.
Baranowksi et al. (1997) reported children (N = 2984)
had lower consumption of fruits and vegetables (FV) on
weekend days compared to weekdays, with lunch time
during weekdays identified as the eating occasion when
children consumed the most FV [175]. This particular
finding was supported by a more recent study that iden-
tified eating lunch from school was associated with
higher overall diet quality compared with eating lunches
from home [176]. Other studies have extended upon
these findings and reported fewer FV were consumed on
weekend days compared to weekdays, with children
(N = 81; age range = 6-9 yrs.) consuming a greater per-
centage of calories from fat and non-nutrient dense
snack foods on weekend days compared to weekdays
[177]. This finding is consistent with an earlier study by
Cullen and colleagues showing that, in comparison to
weekdays, weekend days provided significantly more
high-fat practices (e.g., choosing high-fat foods, adding
fat to foods, preparing foods in fat), fewer low-fat prac-
tices (e.g., choosing lower fat foods, removing skin from
chicken), and a higher percent of energy from fat when

 analyzing student-reported food records completed by
4th – 6th grade children (N = 520) from Texas [178].
Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examin-
ation Survey (NHANES 2003–2008) was analyzed to ex-
plore school meal participation in relation to dietary
quality (N = 2376; 6–17 years old). Hanson et al. (2013)
obtained dietary recalls and examined differences in
Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores for breakfast only and
breakfast and lunch participants. Both categories of
school meal participants (i.e., breakfast only and break-
fast/lunch) had higher mean weekday HEI scores for
milk and vegetables, and lower HEI scores for saturated
fat and sodium compared to their HEI scores for week-
end days [179]. Four out of seven international studies
reported statistically significant findings with children
displaying unhealthy dietary behaviors, such as increased
sugar intake, during weekend days compared to week-
days [68, 113, 182, 183]. Three other international stud-
ies either found no difference [128, 184] or presented
evidence showing favorable dietary behaviors during
weekends compared to weekdays [185].
Discussion
There is a clear need for further investigation in to chil-
dren’s obesogenic behaviors during structured versus
less-structured environments, none more so than school
versus summer. The SDH presents the case that children
require a structured environment to mitigate unhealthy
behaviors from occurring. The evidence presented dem-
onstrates that elementary school-aged children’s obeso-
genic behaviors are less favorable during less-structured
(i.e., weekend days) versus structured days (i.e., week-
days). The findings herein support the argument that
when elementary school-aged children are exposed to
environments that contain less structure, regulation, and
supervision, they indulge in a host of unfavorable behav-
iors. Typically, summer presents 3 months of the calen-
dar year where a less-structured environment can exist
for a prolonged period of time and the observed acceler-
ated weight-gain and losses in CRF [6, 10–17] occurring
during this window demonstrates the adverse impact a
less-structured
environment
can
have on
children’s
health and well-being.
Across all four obesogenic behaviors, 80% of the litera-
ture shows support towards the SDH. The structured na-
ture of weekdays during the school year expose all
children to various PA opportunities (e.g., recess, physical
education, after-school programs, commute to school,
classroom transitions/breaks) not necessarily guaranteed
during weekend days. There is greater heterogeneity re-
garding the presence of structure and regulation on week-
end days for children. This in turn may expose some
children to environments where they are afforded greater
autonomy over how they spend their time and/or present
children with an environment that is constrained in op-
portunity to participate in favorable obesogenic behaviors,
for example, children from low income households may
not have access to PA programming and/or live in neigh-
borhoods where crime is more prevalent, thereby limiting
outdoor PA.
Nonetheless, the literature shows children’s obesogenic
behaviors are beneficially-regulated during weekdays
during the school year. This implies that intervention
efforts should be focused on instances where a less-
structured environment prevails, such as weekend days,
winter breaks, and/or summer vacation. However, the
authors would argue that weekend days during the
school year may not merit intervention. Studies indicate
that during the 9-month school year, increases in obeso-
genic behaviors during weekends and winter breaks do
not impose the same detrimental effects on children’s
health that summer does [6, 10–17], and this may be
due, in part, to the short intermittent nature of weekend
days in comparison to the prolonged duration of sum-
mer. The adverse weight and CRF outcomes associated
with the presence of less-structured days (e.g., weekend
days, winter breaks) are minimized or eliminated be-
cause they are interrupted by longer periods of exposure
to a structured environment. For instance, over a typical
7 day week during the school year, only 2 of the 7 days
are less-structured. Thus, less-structured environments,
in and of themselves, may not be detrimental to weight
gain and loss of CRF. Rather, we argue it is the duration
of exposure to less-structured environments, as repre-
sented by summer vacation, which leads to accelerated
weight gain and loss of CRF. In support, research has
shown when children are exposed to a year-round struc-
tured environment interjected by short periodic breaks
(e.g., year-round schools), they display a steady flat lining
of BMI, particularly overweight and obese children
[186]. Summer represents approximately a quarter of the
calendar
year,
and
this
concentrated,
largely
non-
interrupted exposure to a less-structured environment
appears to be unfavorably impacting the health of chil-
dren. This raises the question of whether summer is
simply one long weekend?
In light of the SDH there are important implications
to be considered by public health practitioners and re-
searchers focused on tackling childhood overweight and
obesity. A great deal of effort and resource has been al-
located for intervening on and improving schools and
other
structured
environments
existing
outside-of-
school time (e.g., afterschool or sport programs) [5].
Reconsidering this strategy may be worthwhile given
that structured environments, by the most part, appear
to be doing a decent job of mitigating adverse health
outcomes from occurring in children. As mentioned pre-
viously, in comparison to school, summer is a time
Brazendale et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2017) 14:100 
Page 8 of 14
 where children have more autonomy and access to fill
their time with unfavorable activities, particularly in the
home environment. Even when autonomy is minimized,
children inherently opt for the less-healthful alternative
(e.g., unhealthy snack, sedentary activity) [25, 187, 188]
and the home environment represents a more open-ended
and less-regulated environment for children to overin-
dulge in unhealthy behaviors that have been associated
with overweight and obesity in children [22, 23, 189].
Thus, the potential for children to adversely impact their
health is much greater during summer compared to when
children are in a more structured and controlled environ-
ment (e.g., school). The authors wish to reiterate that the
argument herein is not for the removal of free time or un-
structured time for children to play. In fact, there are sev-
eral examples of existing environments that are bound
within structured days (e.g., recess at schools, free time at
afterschool programs, sports clubs, and summer day
camps) that offer children choice(s) on how to spend their
time. The day-to-day schedule and segments of these pro-
grams will differ, regardless, it is the mere presence of
these programs that is providing structure to a child’s day,
and therefore, moderating the occurrence of unhealthy
behaviors.
Given children likely spend more time at home during
summer than during the school year, it is important to
consider whether interventions targeting the home en-
vironment are the solution? Home-based childhood
obesity interventions are limited in number and incon-
clusive in their effects [190] and can be a challenging
and
resource-consuming
endeavor
for
practitioners
[191]. Further, low-income and ethnic/racial minority
households, a sub-population identified as having chil-
dren most-at-risk for accelerated weight gain during
summer [11], are susceptible to other economic and en-
vironmental factors (e.g., less income/access to purchase
quality foods for family, safe neighborhoods for outdoor
play etc. [192]) that may limit the success of home-based
intervention strategies. An alternative and intuitive ap-
proach is to provide children with more opportunities and
access to summer structured programs. When children
spend summer days in a more-structured environment
(e.g., summer day camp or program) they display favorable
obesogenic behaviors compared to a less-structured envir-
onment [193, 194]. Public health practitioners and policy
makers need to consider the benefit of structure to a
child’s day and put more effort and resources into devel-
oping strategies and partnerships with community stake-
holders to provide all children equal opportunities and
access to summer structured programs. Overcoming per-
tinent barriers (e.g., cost) that isolate children from these
structured settings is of paramount importance, with a re-
cent American Camp Association report revealing ap-
proximately 75% of youth attending camps in the U.S.
were from middle-to-high income households and Non-
Hispanic White [195].
Conclusions
In conclusion, the SDH posits that the school environ-
ment as a whole plays a protective role against the onset
of unfavorable health outcomes by regulating obesogenic
behaviors through its daily structure, regulation, and
compulsory components. Within the last decade, re-
searchers have identified summer as a time period where
children are at risk of accelerated weight gain and losses
in CRF [10–15], and the majority of this evidence stems
from the U.S. Evidence showing negative health out-
comes in children as a result of summer break in other
countries has yet to be established, but one could specu-
late that a shorter summer break duration (e.g., United
Kingdom, ~6 weeks) may not elicit the same detrimental
impact on health outcomes in children as a longer sum-
mer break duration. Nonetheless, the authors argue that
the SDH operates in a similar fashion, and the evidence
from the international literature supports this with 117
out of 147 international studies showing obesogenic be-
haviors are more favorable on weekdays compared to
weekend days. A key characteristic of both summer and
weekend days is that, typically, both contexts have less
consistent and formal daily structures, regulatory com-
ponents, and present a more autonomous environment
to children, unlike their counterparts (i.e., weekdays dur-
ing the school year). However, the key element that dis-
tinguishes weekend days from summer days is the
prolonged and concentrated period of time children are
exposed to a less-structured environment. Summer is
clearly the critical period where obesity prevention ef-
forts need to be focused. The SDH provides a framework
that can assist researchers and public health practi-
tioners better understand the expression of obesogenic
behaviors during less-structured environments, such as
summer, and aid with the development of innovative ob-
servational studies and future intervention strategies.
