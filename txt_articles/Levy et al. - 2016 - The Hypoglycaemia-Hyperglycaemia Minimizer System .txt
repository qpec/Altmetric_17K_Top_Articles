Abstract
Living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) presents many challenges in terms of daily living. Insulin users need to frequently monitor their blood 
glucose levels and take multiple injections per day and/or multiple boluses through an insulin infusion pump, with the consequences of 
failing to match the insulin dose to the body’s needs resulting in hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia. The former can result in seizures, 
coma and even death; the latter can have both acute and long-term health implications. Many patients with T1D also fail to meet their 
treatment goals. In order to reduce the burdens of self-administering insulin, and improve efficacy and safety, there is a need to at least 
partially remove the patient from the loop via a closed-loop ‘artificial pancreas’ system. The Hypoglycaemia-Hyperglycaemia Minimizer 
(HHM) System, comprising a continuous, subcutaneous insulin infusion pump, continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and closed-loop insulin 
dosing algorithm, is able to predict changes in blood glucose and adjust insulin delivery accordingly to help keep the patient at normal 
glucose levels. Early clinical data indicate that this system is feasible, effective and safe, and has the potential to dramatically improve the 
therapeutic outcomes and quality of life for people with T1D.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a lifelong condition that results from autoimmune 
destruction of insulin-secreting beta cells, resulting in an absence of 
insulin production. In the US, it is estimated that 29.1 million people have 
diabetes,1 with T1D accounting for 5–10% of all cases. Furthermore, its 
incidence is increasing, particularly among children under the age of 15.2 
A doubling of new cases of T1D in European children younger than five 
years has been predicted between 2005 and 2020, with a 70% rise in 
children younger than 15 years.3 Optimal glycaemic control is essential in 
people living with T1D; intensive treatment of T1D has been associated 
with delayed onset and slowed progression of numerous complications, 
including diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy.4
Management of T1D involves multiple daily injections of insulin or 
use of an insulin pump, both of which require the user to actively 
track glucose and calculate the needed insulin dose. There is also a 
significant time lag between when a dose is administered and when it 
takes effect. Other therapies, including immunotherapy and islet cell 
transplantation, have been investigated, but with limited success.5,6
There is therefore a need for an automated system that removes the 
patient from the loop: a closed-loop system.7 This article discusses 
the potential clinical benefits of closed-loop systems, with a focus on 
the Hypoglycaemia-Hyperglycaemia Minimizer System (HHM System; 
Animas Corporation, West Chester, PA, US).
The Treatment Burden of Living with 
Type 1 Diabetes
Exogenous insulin therapy is not subject to the usual physiological feedback 
mechanisms so may induce hypoglycaemia.8 The risk of hypoglycaemia 
limits the efficacy of insulin therapy; the average patient suffers two 
episodes of symptomatic hypoglycaemia per week and one severe episode 
per year.4,8–10 Severe hypoglycaemic episodes often occur during sleep.11 
These episodes, termed nocturnal hypoglycaemia, can cause convulsions 
and coma,12 and can be a rare cause of death in individuals with T1D.13 
The fear of hypoglycaemia has been associated with decreased quality of 
life in children with T1D14 and their parents.15 Fear of hypoglycaemia can 
also result in avoidance of activities beneficial to health, such as exercise.16
In addition, insulin therapy is associated with poor compliance. In 
the US, children with T1D often do not meet their treatment goals 
in terms of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) values.17 Several factors 
contribute to this failure, including difficulty in correctly estimating the 
amount of carbohydrates in a meal, missed meal boluses and anxiety 
about hypoglycaemia resulting in under-treatment. Poor glycaemic 
control may affect cognitive development in children with T1D.18 
In addition, short-term variation in glucose levels can have an effect 
on complications of T1D.19 It is well-known that compliance is difficult 
to achieve with complicated treatment regimens.

Insulin pump therapy has been associated with improvements in 
glycaemic control in adults and children with T1D.20 Continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy is conducted using a durable 
or patch pump that delivers insulin continuously from a cartridge reservoir 
via a subcutaneously inserted cannula. The pump can be programmed 
to deliver varied basal rates of insulin throughout the day, with additional 
boluses of insulin delivered via self-administration at meal times. 
Although all pump models can deliver insulin continuously, a technical 
evaluation conducted on durable pumps such as the OneTouch® Ping® 
(Animas Corporation, West Chester, PA, US), Accu-Chek® Combo (Roche 
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, US) and MiniMed Paradigm® Revel™/
Veo™ (Medtronic, Northridge, CA, US), and one patch pump, such as the 
Insulet OmniPod, showed significant differences in single-dose accuracy 
performance. At a 0.5 U/hr basal rate over 20 hours, durable pumps 
delivering in 3-minute intervals showed better single-dose accuracy 
than the patch pump delivering in 6-minute intervals. Among the durable 
pumps, the OneTouch Ping demonstrated significantly better accuracy.
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in conjunction with home 
blood glucose monitoring can improve glycaemic control21 and 
reduce hypoglycaemia22 in adult patients with T1D. CGM has also been 
associated with benefits in quality of life (QoL), which are correlated with 
satisfaction with device accuracy and usability and trust in one’s ability 
to use CGM data.23 Widespread adoption of CGM has been constrained 
by its cost and limited reimbursement in healthcare schemes,24 but 
a growing body of evidence supports its use,21,25 resulting in expert 
opinions that reimbursement is justified in certain patient groups.26 
In order to be used within a closed-loop system, good continuous 
glucose sensor performance is crucial. However, continuous glucose 
sensors have been associated with a failure to detect more than half 
of hypoglycaemic events as well as giving false alarms of impending 
hypoglycaemia.27 While standards for accuracy exist (International 
Organization for Standardization 15197:2013), there is no consensus 
on a standard method for assessing accuracy. Studies do not always 
assess CGM across all glycaemic ranges.27,28 A comparison of the two 
most widely used sensor systems, the G4® platinum (Dexcom, San 
Diego, CA, US) and the Paradigm Veo Enlite™ (Medtronic, Northridge, CA, 
US) found that the G4 sensor was significantly more accurate than the 
Enlite system, and that both were less accurate in the hypoglycaemic 
range.29 In another study the Dexcom G4 sensor showed greater overall 
accuracy than the Enlite system both overall and for glucose levels in the 
hypoglycaemic range. In addition, patient satisfaction was higher using 
the G4 system than the Enlite.30 A further head-to-head comparison of 
three CGMs (FreeStyle Navigator, [Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA, 
US]; G4 Platinum and Enlite) in adult and paediatric patients with T1D 
under closed-loop blood glucose control demonstrated that the G4 was 
the most accurate and precise of the devices studied, followed closely 
by the Navigator, and both were markedly more accurate and precise 
than the Enlite sensor.31
Perhaps the most important benefit of CGM is avoidance of 
hypoglycaemic events. Hypoglycaemia can also be avoided by 
aiming for a slightly higher glucose target: a set point of 140 mg/dL 
could significantly reduce the risk of severe hypoglycaemia with an 
acceptable increase in time spent at higher glucose range.32 
However, CGM systems have limitations as they still require considerable 
patient participation in terms of glucose testing, counting carbohydrates 
and estimating insulin dosages to be administered. This is feasible, if 
demanding, during the day, but not at night, when many hypoglycaemic 
episodes occur. There remains a need for control algorithms that adjusts 
insulin delivery according to daily food intake and activity.
The Concept of a Closed-loop Delivery System
There remains a need to ‘close the loop’ between the glucose sensor 
and insulin pump. The aim of such a closed-loop delivery system is to at 
least partially automate insulin delivery based on CGM so as to obtain 
improved glucose control. The first closed loop system was developed 
over 40 years ago. However, this device was used only for academic 
purposes.33 Around 20 years ago, large bedside systems using intravenous 
blood sampling and intravenous insulin infusion became available in 
intensive care settings in Japan, but their use was infrequent.34 Transition 
of such systems to routine clinical use requires accurate, minimally 
invasive CGM technology integrated with subcutaneous insulin delivery 
devices – and physiologically informed algorithms to connect the two. 
Recent systems use a control algorithm, i.e. software stored on a pump, 
smartphone or other device, to regulate the insulin delivery based on 
real-time glucose levels obtained by the sensor. The development of 
a closed-loop system has faced many difficulties including accuracy 
of CGM, the physiological time lags involved in the diffusion of the 
glucose from the plasma to the interstitial fluid when glucose is 
changing rapidly and delays in both the absorption of insulin and its 
onset of action after a subcutaneous injection.7 
A number of systems are currently undergoing clinical investigation. A 
growing body of data indicates that these are safe and feasible in daily 
living situations and result in improved glycaemic control (see Table 1).35–43
Industry’s first foray into commercially available closed-loop 
technology was the MiniMed® 530G (Medtronic, Northridge, CA, US). 
In brief, the algorithm in such a device uses simple, straightforward 
logic to suspend insulin delivery when a breach of a low threshold 
is registered by the integrated CGM, with an associated patient 
notification. The suspension continues until that confirmation is 
acknowledged, or when two hours have elapsed, whichever comes 
first.44 Such systems have been shown to be effective in improving 
glycaemic control and reducing hypoglycaemia45 in patients with T1D. 
Other clinical development studies sponsored by Medtronic are in 
progress, investigating more sophisticated algorithms.46 The predictive 
low glucose suspend system represents an advance from the glucose 
suspend device, and halts insulin delivery overnight with the aim of 
preventing nocturnal hypoglycaemia.47–49 Such systems have also been 
evaluated for use during exercise, with positive results.50
 
Studies have found that attitudes towards closed-loop systems are 
positive among patients51 and caregivers of children with T1D.52 Night-
time blood glucose control is the biggest concern for parents and a 
small study (n=19) indicated that 90% of parents trusted an algorithm 
to control overnight insulin delivery.52
 
The Hypoglycaemia–Hyperglycaemia 
Minimizer System
In 2006, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) launched 
the artificial pancreas programme, which involved direct funding and 
collaborations with academic institutions, research centres and industry 
in the US and Europe. Many leading diabetes device manufacturers 
have participated in this project, developing CGM systems and pumps 
with enhanced capability for closed-loop use.

The HHM System has been developed by Animas Corporation in 
collaboration with the JDRF
, and is based on a closed-loop technology 
that it is designed to predict potential hypo- or hyperglycaemic 
excursions, and proactively decrease or increase (respectively) insulin 
infusion in order to mitigate, if not avoid, the excursions. The System 
is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, and comprises a CGM (Dexcom, Inc., 
 
San Diego, CA, US), insulin pump (Animas Corporation, West Chester, PA, 
US), and control algorithm. The main component of the HHM System is

therapy was applied.  
 
 
CL was constantly applied over at least 4 h on 269 nights (80%); sensor data were  
collected over at least 4 h on 282 control nights (84%). CL increased time spent with

reduced by a mean 14 (SD 58) mg/dL (p<0.001). Nights with glucose <63 mg/dL for at  
least 20 min were less frequent during CL (10 versus 17%; p=0.01). Despite lower total  
daily insulin doses by a median 2.3 (interquartile range -4.7 to 9.3) units (p=0.009),  
overall 24-h glucose was reduced by a mean 9 (SD 41) mg/dL (p=0.006) during CL

Multicentre RCT, n=25, age >18, 4 weeks of overnight  
CL insulin delivery (using a model-predictive control 
algorithm to direct insulin delivery), then 4 weeks of

real-time display of continuous glucose monitoring 
independent of their pumps as control), or vice versa.
CL was used over a median of 8.3 h (IQR 6.0–9.6) on 555 (86%) of 644 nights. The  
proportion of time when overnight glucose was in target range was significantly higher 
during the CL period compared with during the control period (mean difference between 
groups 13.5%, 95% CI 7.3–19.7; p=0.0002). No severe hypoglycaemic episodes during  
the control period compared with two episodes during the CL period: these episodes  
were not related to CL algorithm instructions

Two multicentre RCTs under free-living home conditions, 
we compared CL insulin delivery with sensor-augmented 
pump therapy in 58 patients with type 1 diabetes. The  
CL system was used day and night by 33 adults and 
overnight by 25 children and adolescents. Participants 
used the CL system for a 12-week period and sensor-
augmented pump therapy (control) for a similar period 
 
 
Glucose levels were in target range for 11% (95% CI 8.1–13.8) longer with the CL  
than with control (p<0.001). Mean glucose level was lower during CL than during control 
phase (difference, -11 mg per deciliter; 95% CI -17 to -6; p<0.001), as were the AUC for  
the period when glucose level was < 63 mg/dL (39% lower; 95% CI 24 to 51; p<0.001)  
and the mean glycated haemoglobin level (difference, -0.3%; 95% CI -0.5 to -0.1;  
p=0.002). Among children and adolescents, the proportion of time with the night-time 
glucose level in the target range was higher during CL than during the control phase (by 
24.7%; 95% CI 20.6 to 28.7; p<0.001), and the mean night-time glucose level was lower 
(difference, -29 mg/dL; 95% CI -39 to -20; p<0.001). Three severe hypoglycaemic

the control algorithm, which calculates the optimal amount of insulin to 
deliver to the patient based on CGM trends, previously infused insulin 
and model predictions. The algorithm determines how much insulin is 
needed to result in the optimal glucose trajectory for the near future, and 
transmits this information to the insulin pump for delivery. This process 
is repeated every five minutes, each time a new CGM datum is received.
Feasibility Studies Investigating the 
Hypoglycaemia-Hyperglycaemia  
Minimizer System
Three clinical research centre (CRC)-based studies have investigated 
the feasibility of the HHM System. One of these studies was conducted 
in 13 adults with T1D, who underwent closed-loop control lasting 
approximately 20 hours, including an overnight period and two 
meals. The predictive HHM System decreased insulin infusion rates 
below the participants’ preset basal rates ahead of excursions below 
the prespecified target zone (CGM <90 mg/dL), and delivered 80.4% 
less basal insulin during such excursions. Similarly, the HHM System 
increased infusion rates when a breach of the upper threshold (CGM 
>140 mg/dL) was predicted, and delivered 39.9% more insulin than 
basal during these excursions. Subjects spent a mean ± standard 
deviation (SD) of 0.2±0.5% of the study at glucose levels <70 mg/dL, 
including 0.3±0.9% during the overnight period. The mean glucose level 
across the entire study period was 164.5±23.5 mg/dL. The HHM was 
able to administer insulin safely and, on nine occasions, recommended 
the administration of carbohydrate in the form of which was 15 g of 
carbohydrate as juice or glucose tablets. During the study, there were 
no instances of severe hypoglycaemia or diabetic ketoacidosis.53
A second feasibility study was conducted in 20 adults with T1D 
to assess the predictive capability of the HHM System in terms 
 
of mitigating hypoglycaemic excursions, defined as a breach of the 
70 mg/dL threshold, by CGM. First, the potential of the system to 
prevent hypoglycaemic excursions was investigated by quantifying the 
frequency of times that the glucose level assessed by CGM reached 
a local nadir of between 70–90 mg/dL (see Figure 3), indicating that 
it was potentially due to the algorithm’s hypoglycaemia-mitigating, 
insulin-reducing action that the CGM began to rise following its nadir. 
In order to isolate the effects of the algorithm, the glucose-increasing 
effects of carbohydrate meals were excluded in the calculation of 
this metric, by ignoring data received during the hour following each 
meal. Second, the capability to proactively mitigate hypoglycaemic 
excursions was quantified as the average lead time, before a breach of 
the CGM 70 mg/dL threshold, that the algorithm reduced or suspended 
insulin delivery. In addition, the amount of insulin withheld during this 
period was assessed. Thirdly, the ability of the algorithm to warn of 
imminent hypoglycaemic events was quantified by the average lead 
time, before the breach, that the alarm was triggered. Results showed 
that a CGM nadir between 70 and 90 occurred an average of 1.75 times 
per subject per day. On average, over 24 h, subjects spent 80–90% the 
time within the normal glycaemic range. Additionally, fewer than half 
of the subjects had blood glucose values less than 70 mg/dL during 
the overnight period. It must be noted, however, in this small feasibility 
study, that it cannot be known with what frequency the actions of the 
algorithm were directly responsible for avoiding hypoglycaemic events. 
The algorithm reduced insulin delivery for an average of 39 minutes 
prior to breaches of the CGM 70 mg/dL threshold, accounting for an 
average of 0.5 U of insulin not delivered to the participant, relative 
to their corresponding basal rates. The algorithm delivered warnings 
of imminent hypoglycaemia on average 7.1 minutes before such 
breaches. The investigators concluded that the HHM System reduced 
insulin delivery and triggered warnings before the CGM breached the 
low glucose threshold.
This study also evaluated the ‘aggressiveness factor’, which refers to 
the speed and magnitude at which the control algorithm adjusts insulin 
infusion in response to changing CGM measurements (see Figure 4). 
Enrolment criteria were current use of an insulin infusion pump with 
rapid-acting insulin, and a HbA1c level <10%. Participants were assigned 
to conservative, medium and aggressive values. Time spent within the 
normal glycaemic range was highest using the aggressive setting.54,55
In a third study, 12 adults with T1D were studied for approximately 
24 hours. The purpose of this study was to isolate the hypoglycaemia 
minimisation aspect of the HHM System. As the aggressiveness setting 
was increased from ‘conservative’ to ‘medium’ to ‘aggressive’, the 
controller recommended less insulin (-3.3% versus -14.4% versus 
-19.5% relative to basal) with a higher frequency (5.3% versus 14.4% 
versus 20.3%) during the critical times when the CGM reading was 
decreasing and in the range 90–120 mg/dL. The most aggressive 
 
setting resulted in the least time spent at low blood glucose levels 
 
(<70 mg/dL) and the most time spent within the normal glycaemic range 
(70–180 mg/dL), particularly in the overnight period. Hyperglycaemia,

Discussion
T1D is a chronic condition that can currently only be well managed with 
constant vigilance, placing a huge burden on patients with T1D and 
their families. It is hoped that the development of closed-loop systems 
may result in significant improvements to the quality of life of patients 
with T1D. 
While current closed-loop technology for artificial pancreas applications 
has matured to the point of commercial viability, there remain a 
number of scientific and technological limitations in such systems. 
Such limitations include the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic 
delays associated with subcutaneous insulin absorption and action; 
the infeasibility of automatically measuring carbohydrate intake; the 
disparate patterns of carbohydrate absorption, which varies based 
on a number of factors such as meal composition – and therefore the 
inability to accurately model the effects of meals on blood glucose; and 
the unavailability or nascence of biometric sensors that may inform the 
control algorithm. 
At least some of these barriers to optimal diabetes control may soon 
be broken down by developments in tangential scientific fields. For 
example, the formulations of faster-acting insulins may open the door 
to fully automated meal-time control; continued improvements in the 
accuracy and reliability of CGM systems may alleviate the burden, at 
least in part, of blood glucose self-monitoring; the development and 
commercialisation of med-tech devices able to measure biometrics 
or surrogates thereof – such as physiological stress and energy 
expenditure – may help realise a more holistic, robust control algorithm. 
Future algorithms and systems have a great deal of opportunity in the 
years ahead to further improve the lives of people with T1D.
The HHM System is a predictive system designed to mitigate, if not 
avoid completely, hypo- and hyperglycaemic excursions. The superior 
accuracy and reliability of its CGM sensor and insulin pump are well 
established. The HHM System has shown promising results in feasibility 
studies, enabling patients to stay within the designated normal glucose 
range for up to 90% of the time during a 24-h period. The authors 
acknowledge the (unavoidable) caveats of these CRC-based studies, 
namely, the artificial and sedentary environment in which the studies 
were performed. Nonetheless, the system demonstrated, through its 
controller actions, the potential to minimise, if not avert entirely, some 
hypo- and hyperglycaemic excursions. A pivotal study is planned in a 
larger patient population in ambulatory (‘free-living’) conditions that 
will investigate the safety and efficacy of the system, including the final 
controller configuration and human factors considerations. ■
