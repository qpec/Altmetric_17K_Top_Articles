Summary
The magnitude of the 2013–2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic enabled an unprecedented 
number of viral mutations to occur over successive human-to-human transmission events, 
increasing the probability that adaptation to the human host occurred during the outbreak. We 
investigated one nonsynonymous mutation, Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) mutant A82V, 
for its effect on viral infectivity. This mutation, located at the NPC1-binding site on EBOV GP,

 occurred early in the 2013–2016 outbreak and rose to high frequency. We found that GP-A82V 
had heightened ability to infect primate cells, including human dendritic cells. The increased 
infectivity was restricted to cells that have primate-specific NPC1 sequences at the EBOV 
interface, suggesting that this mutation was indeed an adaptation to the human host. GP-A82V was 
associated with increased mortality, consistent with the hypothesis that the heightened intrinsic 
infectivity of GP-A82V contributed to disease severity during the EVD epidemic.

Introduction
Ebola virus (EBOV) is an enveloped filovirus with a 19 kb, negative-sense, single-stranded 
RNA genome that causes sporadic outbreaks of lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans 
(Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011; Kuhn et al., 2010). EBOV was identified as a human 
pathogen in 1976 (Bowen et al., 1977; Johnson et al., 1977; Pattyn et al., 1977). The high 
case-fatality rate and self-limited nature of EVD outbreaks suggest that EVD is a zoonosis 
(Bausch and Schwarz, 2014; Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011). Detection of anti-EBOV 
antibodies and EBOV RNA in several fruit bat species from central Africa make them 
leading candidates for the animal reservoir (Hayman et al., 2012; Leroy et al., 2005; Ng et 
al., 2015; Pourrut et al., 2007, 2009). Historically, Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks have 
been geographically limited and resolved after at most a few hundred cases (CDC, 2016). In 
contrast, the epidemic caused by the EBOV Makona variant was much larger: it began in 
Guinea in 2013 (Baize et al., 2014), spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia in 2014, and infected 
more than 28,000 people before it was controlled in 2016 (WHO, 2016).

 While sociological and epidemiological factors were central to the 2013–2016 epidemic’s 
unprecedented scale (Alexander et al., 2015), researchers have also examined the possibility 
that genetic changes unique to EBOV Makona played a role. To date, experiments with 
EBOV Makona have not detected evidence for increased replication phenotypes. Studies in 
primates and in immunodeficient mice, for example, failed to detect increased virulence with 
EBOV Makona compared to EBOV Mayinga, the 1976 reference isolate (Marzi et al., 2015; 
Smither et al., 2016). Likewise, the EBOV Makona immunomodulatory proteins VP35 and 
VP24 inhibited interferon signaling to the same extent as the analogous proteins encoded by 
EBOV from previous outbreaks (Dunham et al., 2015). These studies, however, only 
examined the early reference EBOV Makona isolate from Kissidougou, Guinea (C-15), and 
did not address possible changes in the virus over the course of the epidemic.
The large number of human-to-human transmissions of EBOV Makona during the 2013–
2016 EVD epidemic provided greater opportunity for EBOV to adapt to the human host than 
in any previous outbreak. As expected for an RNA virus, monitoring over the course of the 
EVD epidemic revealed mutations throughout the genome of EBOV Makona (Carroll et al., 
2015a; Gire et al., 2014a; Simon-Loriere et al., 2015). However, except for the mucin-like 
domain in the glycoprotein (GP), which is under diversifying selection by the host humoral 
immune system, most of the EBOV genome exhibited purifying selection (Park et al., 2015). 
Although most nonsynonymous mutations detected during the epidemic likely had little 
effect on viral fitness, it is possible that some of these mutations proliferated because they 
conferred an advantage to the virus. One such candidate is the clade-defining A82V 
substitution in EBOV Makona GP, which emerged at a time in the epidemic just before the 
number of EVD cases increased exponentially. This mutation is particularly intriguing since 
it is located in the receptor-binding domain of EBOV GP. Here we describe our efforts to 
determine if GP-A82V conferred a replication advantage to the virus.
Results
GP-A82V was first detected just prior to the exponential increase in cases and rapidly 
exceeded the prevalence of the ancestral Makona EBOV
To get the broadest possible perspective on the EBOV sequence evolution that took place 
during the 2013–2016 EVD epidemic, we generated a phylogenetic tree using 1,489 EBOV 
Makona sequences for which near-complete genomes were available (Tables S1 and S2). 
The tree demonstrated two distinct lineages (Figure 1A). The first lineage consisted of 86 
sequences, and was largely confined to the region around Conakry, Guinea. The second 
lineage formed a monophyletic clade comprised of 1,403 genomes sampled between March 
2014 and August 2015. The second lineage included EBOV from all countries affected by 
the epidemic, and was largely defined by two mutations: a non-synonymous C-to-T 
substitution at nucleotide 6,283, resulting in the GP-A82V substitution, and a synonymous 
T-to-C substitution at nucleotide 1,849, which encodes amino acid D460 of the viral NP. In 
addition to being present in the vast majority of EBOV infections during the 2013–2016 
epidemic, the GP-A82V mutant was of interest because residue 82 is located at the receptor 
binding interface (Gong et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016).

 The two lineages were plotted according to date and country of sampling (Figure 1B–E). 
GP-A82V was first sampled in Guinea in March 2014. It was next sampled in May 2014 in 
Sierra Leone. In June 2014 the GP-A82V lineage was again sampled in Guinea. The number 
of EVD cases caused by GP-A82V in Liberia and Sierra Leone grew rapidly in the summer 
and fall of 2014 with no apparent contribution from the first, ancestral lineage. In the fall of 
2014, EBOV was re-introduced into Guinea from Liberia and Sierra Leone, resulting in a 
burst of additional cases (Carroll et al., 2015a; Quick et al., 2016a; Simon-Loriere et al., 
2015).
We detected 114 additional amino acid substitutions in the EBOV Makona GP population, 
though none of these approached the prevalence of GP-A82V. The majority of these were 
not pursued further because they were located in the mucin-like domain, which is 
dispensable for entry into target cells (Chandran et al., 2005a; Jeffers et al., 2002; Kaletsky 
et al., 2007; Schornberg et al., 2006). Instead, we focused on a sub-lineage of GP-A82V 
with an A-to-G change at nucleotide 6,726 that results in a GP-A82V/T230A double mutant 
(Figure 1A). Aside from GP-A82V, T230A was the most frequently observed non-
synonymous mutation (2.5%) outside of the mucin-like domain. Four isolates from the GP-
A82V/T230A sub-lineage possessed an additional A-to-G substitution at nucleotide 7,947 
that resulted in the triple mutant, GP-A82V/T230A/D637G. These mutants were studied 
further, as described below.
EBOV Makona GP-A82V increases infectivity in human cells
The naturally-occurring GP mutants A82V, A82V/T230A, and A82V/T230A/D637G were 
evaluated for their ability to infect cells by placing them in a mammalian expression plasmid 
containing the gene encoding EBOV Makona GP. Plasmids were constructed for the 
ancestral sequence and for each mutant combination. Additionally, the single mutants, GP-
T230A and GP-D637G, were constructed, although these mutations were never observed 
independently of GP-A82V during the epidemic. The expression plasmids were used to 
generate EBOV GP-pseudotyped lentiviral virion particles bearing a GFP reporter gene. 
Equal volumes of each supernatant were used to transduce the human osteosarcoma cell line 
U2OS after confirming that each construct generated comparable amounts of particles by 
measuring reverse transcriptase activity in the supernatant. 72 hrs later, the transduction 
efficiency for each GP was assessed by measuring the percent GFP-positive cells by flow 
cytometry. Lentiviruses bearing GP-A82V, GP-A82V/T230A, or GP-A82V/T230A/D637G, 
produced 4-fold more GFP positive cells than did particles bearing the ancestral GP (Figure 
2A). In contrast, pseudotypes bearing either of the single mutants, GP-T230A or GP-
D637G, produced GFP positive cells at a rate similar to the ancestral GP.
To determine if the observed infectivity differences were peculiar to U2OS cells, similar 
transductions were performed with HEK293 cells as target cells. In HEK293 cells, a 2-fold 
increase in infectivity was observed with lentiviral particles pseudotyped with GP-A82V, 
GP-A82V/T230A, or GP-A82V/T230A/D637G (Figure 2B). Once again, no statistically 
significant changes were observed with transductions using either of the single mutants, GP-
T230A or GP-D637G.

 Dendritic cells (DCs) are targets for EBOV replication in vivo, at both early and later stages 
of infection (Geisbert et al., 2003). We therefore looked at the effect of the GP mutants on 
infection of this critical cell type (Figure 2C). Human monocyte-derived DCs were 
generated from 8 blood donors. These cells were challenged with ancestral and with mutant 
EBOV GP-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. As compared to the ancestral GP, A82V-
containing GPs had significantly enhanced infectivity, while individually the T230A and 
D637G substitutions either had no effect, or had less infectivity.
Amino acid substitutions introduced into the EBOV GP may alter rates of protein production 
and processing, protein stability, or protein incorporation into virions. To determine whether 
any of these properties were changed by the EBOV GP mutants, the amount of ancestral 
versus mutant GP present in our EBOV GP-pseudotyped lentiviruses was compared. EBOV 
GP-pseudotyped lentiviruses were enriched by acceleration through a 25% sucrose cushion, 
and virion-associated proteins were analyzed by western blotting, using polyclonal 
antiserum against a V5 epitope tag that was appended to the carboxy terminus of the GP. GP 
is cleaved by furin into two components, GP1 and GP2, and our western blot showed two 
distinct bands. One band was 70 kDa, consistent in size with full-length GP, either uncleaved 
by furin or GP1+GP2 covalently bound by disulfide linkages (Figure 2D). The second band 
was 25 kDa, consistent with the furin-processed GP2 product. GP1 + GP2 band intensity 
was compared to the intensity of the lentivirion capsid core (p24). All GPs showed 
equivalent levels of incorporation into particles, indicating that the enhanced infectivity 
observed in human cells with the GP-A82V-containing EBOV GPs was not due to 
differences in protein synthesis, processing, or GP incorporation into lentiviral particles.
GP-A82V enhances GP-mediated entry of EBOV virion cores into the target cell cytoplasm
The EBOV matrix protein VP40 is sufficient to drive assembly and budding of filamentous 
virus-like particles (VLPs) from the producer cell plasma membrane (Geisbert and Jahrling, 
1995; Noda et al., 2002). VP40 is also sufficient for incorporation of EBOV GP into the 
virion membrane, such that the resulting particles are capable of bona fide receptor-mediated 
entry into target cell cytoplasm. To facilitate quantitation of EBOV GP-mediated entry, 
EBOV VP40 fused to β-lactamase was used to generate VLPs. These VLPs were used to 
infect target cells, and subsequently target cells were loaded with a fluorogenic substrate that 
is trapped within the target cell cytoplasm. The substrate can only be cleaved if the GP 
successfully attaches, binds, and triggers fusion, releasing β-lactamase-VP40 into the 
cytoplasm (Manicassamy and Rong, 2009; Tscherne et al., 2010). This experimental system 
does not require transcription of reporter genes, and therefore more directly tests whether the 
EBOV GP mutants increase the ability of EBOV VP40 cores to enter into the target cell 
cytoplasm. β-lactamase-containing VLPs bearing ancestral or mutant EBOV GPs were 
incubated with U2OS target cells, and then cells were loaded with the fluorogenic substrate. 
GP-A82V or GP-A82V/T230A bearing particles exhibited a significant increase in entry as 
compared with the ancestral EBOV GP (Figure 3). In contrast, a decrease in entry was 
measured with the T230A and D637G mutant GPs.

 GP-A82V increases infectivity in primate cells but not in cells from other species
Next, we determined whether GP-A82V was more infectious for cells of any permissive 
species, or if the increased infectivity was a human-specific adaptation. NPC1 is the main 
cellular receptor for EBOV (Carette et al., 2011; Côté et al., 2011), and the EBOV GP-
interacting region of NPC1 has been well defined (Gong et al., 2016; Krishnan et al., 2012; 
Wang et al., 2016). As the EBOV interacting loop 2 of NPC1 is positioned in close 
proximity to EBOV GP-82, we assessed species-specific amino acid differences within this 
portion of NPC1 from 49 mammalian species (Figures 4A and B, Table S3).
EBOV interacting loop 2 of NPC1 is almost perfectly conserved in primates (Figure 4B). 
Only two species, the New World monkey Callithrix jacchus and the lemur Microcebus 
murinus, harbor amino acid differences from those found in human NPC1: K499I in 
Callithrix jacchus, and K499V in Microcebus murinus. Outside of primates, nearly all 
species have a non-polar amino acid at residue 499, the exception being rabbits (Oryctolagus 
cuniculus), which have a glutamine. Several species harbor amino acid changes in residue 
502. Previous studies have shown that a D-to-F substitution at residue 502 disrupts 
interaction between EBOV GP and NPC1 in straw colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) (Ng 
et al., 2015), and it is likely that similar substitutions would prevent EBOV infection in killer 
whales (Orcinus orca), pigs (Sus scrofa), Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis), and 
possibly the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus).
Based on the NPC1 sequence alignments, we anticipated that infections using EBOV GP-
A82V variants in non-human primate cells would result in a similar enhancement to that 
seen in human cells. To test this prediction, we transduced cells from several primate 
species, as well as carnivores and rodents, with GFP-expressing lentiviral vectors 
pseudotyped with the EBOV GPs. Indeed, cells from non-human primates were more 
susceptible to infection by GP-A82V (Figure 4C). In contrast, cells from rodents and 
carnivores showed no difference in infectivity between the ancestral EBOV GP and GP-
A82V. These results demonstrate that the GP-A82V provides primate-specific enhancement 
of infectivity.
Homology modeling was used to examine how EBOV GP-A82V and NPC1 loop 2 domain 
orthologues from the mammalian species tested here - as well as from bat species that are 
potential EBOV reservoirs - may alter virus-host interactions (Figure 5). The EBOV GP-
A82V mutation is located on the α1 helix that directly interacts with NPC1 loop 2 (Figure 
5A), though residue 82 is located on the back side of the helix. In terms of how V82 is likely 
to affect the viral GP, our modeling suggests that the GP-A82V mutation will have little 
impact on the α1 helix backbone itself. Rather the additional alkane branches in the side 
chain of valine compared to alanine may differentially impact neighboring amino acids such 
as the arginine at residue 85 (Figure 5B–C). R85 extends into a charged pocket present on 
the opposite side of the α1 helix to where NPC1 interaction occurs and the nitrogens of the 
terminal guanidinium group are likely to form ionic interactions with the sidechains of 
E178, Y109, and the backbone hydroxyl group of A76. On the host side, several amino acid 
differences in the NPC1 loop 2 domain among mammals are likely to impact filovirus 
susceptibility in a species-specific manner (Wang et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). 
Specifically, a lysine is found at residue 499 in primates while all other species examined

 possess a non-polar residue here and several species, including mouse and dog, possess a 
tyrosine at 504 in place of phenylalanine (Figure 5D–E).
EBOV Makona GP-A82V is associated with a higher rate of mortality
To determine if the GP-A82V mutation had detectable effect on viremia or mortality we 
obtained EBOV genotype data from 56 locations in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (Arias 
et al., 2016; Carroll et al., 2015a; Gire et al., 2014a; Kugelman et al., 2015; Ladner et al., 
2015; Park et al., 2015; Quick et al., 2016a; Simon-Loriere et al., 2015; Tong et al., 2015), 
where mortality and viral load information was also available. This data recapitulated the 
skew (82V>82A) that was seen in EBOV GP genotype prevalence per country depicted in 
Figure 1 (Figure 6A). Further analysis was restricted to those cases for which data was 
available regarding all four parameters: viral load, mortality, sampling location, and viral 
genotype (Carroll et al., 2015a; Gire et al., 2014a; Quick et al., 2016a). As all but 15 of these 
194 cases occurred in Guinea, the analysis was further restricted to Guinea, with samples 
from 19 districts. After paring down the data, geographic differences in the prevalence of 
viral genotypes remained (Figure 6B).
We examined associations between viral load (as assessed by C(t) values), risk of death and 
GP-82 allele, and found that both viral load and possession of GP-A82V were significantly 
associated with higher mortality. Lower C(t) values (corresponding to higher viral loads) 
were highly predictive of negative outcome (Figure 6C), consistent with previous reports (de 
La Vega et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016). GP-A82V infected individuals had slightly higher viral 
loads (lower C(t) value, Figure 6D), but the difference was not statistically significant 
(Student t-test: mean A = 20.07, mean V = 19.68, 95% CI for difference in the means 
[−0.69, 1.44]; p-value = 0.49). Infection by virus with GP-A82V was associated with a 
significantly higher risk of death (raw odds ratio: 2.64, 95% confidence interval [1.29, 5.38], 
Figure 6E).
To better understand the association between GP-A82V and mortality, we modeled the 
fatality rates for both the ancestral and GP-A82V genotypes over a range of viral loads 
(transformed C(t) values) (Figure 6F). After correcting for differences in C(t) values, the 
adjusted odds ratio for GP-A82V remained above one, but with a wide confidence interval 
(OR = 2.09, 95% CI [0.94, 4.64]). When we added multiple potential confounding factors, 
including geographic variation in base fatality rate and access to health care, to the model, 
they had little effect on the conclusion. We found only modest evidence of geographic 
variation (Figure S3), while including the cumulative number of EVD cases per region (a 
proxy for EVD-associated burdens on the health care infrastructure) failed to improve model 
fit (Figure S3). Taken together, these data suggest an increased risk of death in people 
infected with GP-A82V, but we cannot rule out that there is no independent effect of the 
mutation, or demonstrate that the association is causal.
Discussion
The devastating 2013–2016 EVD epidemic led to two orders of magnitude more cases than 
in previous EVD outbreaks (CDC, 2016), providing greater opportunity for EBOV to 
undergo human adaptive changes than ever before. The A82V mutation in EBOV Makona

 GP arose early during the outbreak, nearly replacing the ancestral genotype, and was present 
in the viruses responsible for the majority of EVD cases during the epidemic (Figure 1). Our 
data show that GP-A82V enhances infectivity in human and other primate cells but not in 
cells of other mammalian species (Figure 2 and 4). Given that GP-A82V is located at the 
NPC1 binding interface, we are left with a strong suspicion that GP-A82V represents an 
EBOV adaptation to the human host. Human population data reveal a modest trend towards 
higher viremia with GP-A82V and a significant association with increased mortality (Figure 
6), raising the intriguing possibility that these phenotypes result from this mutation.
In a co-submitted manuscript, Urbanowicz and colleagues independently arrived at the 
conclusion that GP-A82V enhances viral infectivity in human cells (Urbanowicz et al., 
2016). In their hands, GP-A82V enhanced infectivity within the context of numerous GP 
sequences observed during the outbreak. Complementary to our findings, they showed that 
GP-A82V has decreased infectivity for a variety of bat cell lines, species with amino acid 
substitutions in NPC1 binding loop 2 that are similar to those in the non-primate species 
tested here (Figure 4 and 5). Their data support the hypothesis that A82V is a primate-
specific adaptation.
For GP-A82V, our molecular data warrant follow-up with in vivo, high containment (BSL-4) 
experiments. Reverse genetics systems have been used to study live EBOV variants 
(Volchkov et al., 2001), and can be used for head-to-head comparison of variants in cell 
culture-based assays (Albariño et al., 2016). Moreover, while human clinical data shows that 
GP-A82V was associated with higher case fatality rate, controlled BSL-4 experiments could 
test whether GP-A82V is causal for this clinical phenotype or with higher viral load in non-
human primates.
The GP-A82V mutation enhances infectivity for human cells through GP-mediated fusion 
(Figure 3), suggesting a biologically plausible mechanism for cross-species viral adaptation. 
Emergence of human viral disease from a reservoir host is a major route of virus 
transmission, as has been documented for human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 and 2 
(HIV-1 and HIV-2), severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus (SARS-CoV), influenza virus, 
dengue virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and Marburg virus (Parrish et al., 2008). Because 
of shared co-evolutionary history, zoonotic viruses are thought to replicate and transmit 
more efficiently in their reservoir hosts than in humans. In a new host, while productive 
infection may occur, differences in key host factors between cells of the reservoir versus 
those of the new host can impair important events such as: receptor binding and entry, 
replication of the viral genome, virion assembly and release, and avoidance of the host 
innate or adaptive immune response. More efficient receptor utilization in the new host is a 
common route of adaptation, and has been described for SARS CoV (Li et al., 2005) and 
numerous influenza strains (Herfst et al., 2012; Imai et al., 2012; Matrosovich et al., 2000; 
Stevens et al., 2006a, 2006b; Xu et al., 2010). These experimental findings involving 
influenza have allowed for more informed surveillance of the animal reservoirs as well as 
providing a better understanding of the ongoing viral evolution in humans (Dugan et al., 
2008; Holmes et al., 2005; Nelson et al., 2008; Obenauer et al., 2006; Rambaut et al., 2008; 
Russell et al., 2012). The knowledge that EBOV GP mutations which modulate fusion to 
host cells may be a route for human adaptation, and which GP residues mediate this

 adaptation, is potentially valuable knowledge for surveillance activities during future EBOV 
epidemics.
The GP-A82V mutation is on the backside of the α1 helix that interacts with NPC1, and is 
therefore predicted to have little direct impact on binding to NPC1. However, there are likely 
to be differences in how the alanine and valine side chains pack against neighboring amino 
acids. Valine contains more alkane branches than alanine, which would place the side-chain 
in closer proximity to GP-R85 and –W86. Steric hindrance between V82 and R85 may alter 
a predicted salt bridge between R85 and E178 (~2.7 Å apart, Figure 5). In addition, the 
added “bulk” of the GP-A82V mutation may alter the α1 helix conformation, to provide 
better access for proximal resides, such as GP-V79, -P80, -T83, and -W86, to interact with 
NPC1 (Wang et al., 2016). Compared to the human NPC1 loop 2 domain, the inclusion of 
hydrophobic side-chains at site 499 (valine or isoleucine) in other mammals (non-primates) 
likely adds more bulk near the backbone, potentially restricting how the loop can adapt to 
new conformations. Primates also possess a phenylalanine at amino acid 504, while several 
other species have a tyrosine. Changes between phenylalanine and tyrosine are common, 
differing only by an ortho hydrogen (phenylalanine) or hydroxyl group (tyrosine) on the 
benzene ring, and both are generally non-reactive and rarely involved in protein function. 
F504, however, is predicted to make contact with up to eight residues on EBOV GP 
(measured by a distance of < 4.5 Å, (Wang et al., 2016)), and is potentially a critical site for 
filovirus susceptibility (Zhao et al., 2016). In addition to the effects the A82V substitution 
could impart on NPC1/GP interactions it may also alter the propensity for EBOV GP to 
undergo “triggering” upon interaction with NPC1. In this context the triggering process 
refers to the dramatic conformational changes undertaken by the EBOV GP resulting in the 
exposure of the viral fusion peptide on GP2, which is normally sequestered by GP1.
If GP-A82V is an adaptation to humans, it remains an open question whether this change led 
not only to increased replication in human hosts, but to increased transmission between 
humans. The GP-A82V mutation was first sampled on March 31st 2014 (File S1), following 
only approximately 110 EVD cases (CDC, 2016). Our data show that GP-A82V increases 
infectivity of EBOV for a variety of human cells in tissue culture and is associated with 
increased mortality in humans. While significant questions remain, our findings raise the 
possibility that this mutation contributed directly to greater transmission, and thus to the 
severity of the outbreak. It is difficult to draw any conclusion about this hypothesis, though, 
since the frequency increase can also be attributed to stochastic effects, including founder 
effects as EBOV moved from Guinea into Sierra Leone, and multiple re-introductions of 
GP-A82V back into Guinea. In any case, the early emergence of GP-A82V highlights the 
need for vigorous surveillance and rapid public health intervention following identification 
of EVD and other emerging infectious diseases, in order to limit the possibility of viral 
adaptation to humans. Finally, studies such as this are necessary, as they provide vital 
biological information crucial for the interpretation of viral sequence evolution. Having this 
connection between viral genotype and phenotype maximizes the utility of viral sequencing 
efforts during outbreaks, allowing more efficient targeting of intervention strategies.

EXPERIMENTAL MODELS AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Cell Lines and Primary Human MDDCs—HEK-293 (human [Homo sapiens] fetal 
kidney), U2OS (human [Homo sapiens] osteosarcoma), Vero (African green monkey 
[Chlorocebus aethiops] kidney), FRhk4 (rhesus macaque [Macaca mulatta] kidney), CRFK 
(cat [Felis catus] fetal kidney), Cf2Th (dog [Canis familiaris] fetal thymus), and NIH/3T3 
(house mouse [Mus musculus] embryonic fibroblast) cells were obtained from the ATCC 
(www.atcc.org). S008842 (Chimpanzee [Pan troglodytes] skin fibroblast) cells were 
obtained from Coriell Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). MDTF (earth colored mouse [Mus 
dunni] tail fibroblast) cells were obtained from Greg Towers (UCL, London, UK). Cell lines 
were tested to verify the absence of mycoplasma. No assays were performed to verify the 
identity of the cells in culture following receipt of the cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) were isolated from de-identified, healthy donor leukopaks (New York 
Biologics, Southampton, NY), in accordance with UMMS-IRB protocol ID #H00004971, 
which deems these cells non-human subjects research.
METHOD DETAILS
Sequence Data and Alignments—All publicly available EBOV Makona genomes were 
downloaded from the NIAID Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) 
(Pickett et al., 2012) which can be accessed at https://www.viprbrc.org/ in July 2016 
(n=1,636; Table S1). Sequences with >0.2% ambiguous or missing nucleotide calls were 
removed, and a high quality dataset of sequences was created comprising 1,489 coding-
complete genomes (Table S2). Sequences were aligned with MAFFT v6.902b (Katoh and 
Standley, 2013) with the following parameters (L-INS-i): --localpair --maxiterate 1000 -- 
reorder --ep 0.123. Nucleotide alignments used for phylogenetic analyses were trimmed 
using trimAl v1.4 (Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009) with the maximum likelihood specific 
parameter: -automated1. Alignments of NPC1 amino acid sequences and EBOV Makona GP 
were also performed with MAFFT. Relevant alignments can be found in File S1.
Phylogenetic Analysis—Maximum likelihood phylogenies were made with RAxML 
v7.3.0 (Stamatakis et al., 2005) using the GTRγ nucleotide substitution model. Fifty 
consecutive runs were performed and the tree with the best likelihood score was 
bootstrapped with 100 pseudoreplicates. To root the tree, all EBOV Makona sequences from 
Guinea were aligned with the 1976 EBOV Mayinga variant as an outgroup, which identified 
the earliest sequences from the 2013–2016 EVD epidemic as the most likely root of the tree 
(File S1). All subsequent trees were rooted according to this analysis (File S1).
Cell Culture—All cells were maintained at 37° C in 5% CO 2 humidified incubators. 
HEK-293, U2OS, CRFK, NIH/3T3, and MDTF were maintained in DMEM supplemented

 with 10% FBS. S008842 were maintained in α-MEM supplemented with 15% FBS. Vero 
and FRhK4 were maintained in EMEM supplemented with 20% FBS. Cf2Th were 
maintained in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS. HEPES pH 7.2–7.5 was added to all of 
these medium formulations at a final concentration of 10 mM. Mononuclear leukocytes were 
isolated by gradient centrifugation on Histopaque-1077 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). 
CD14+ mononuclear cells were enriched via positive selection using anti-CD14 antibody 
MicroBead conjugates (Miltenyi, San Diego, CA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 
CD14+ cells were then plated at a density of 1 to 2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI-1640 
supplemented with 5% heat inactivated human AB+ serum (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA), 
20 mM L-glutamine (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA), 25 mM HEPES pH 7.2 (Sigma-
Aldrich), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (ThermoFisher), and 1 × MEM non-essential amino acids 
(ThermoFisher). Differentiation of the CD14+ monocytes into dendritic cells (MDDCs) was 
promoted by addition of recombinant human GM-CSF and human IL-4; cytokines were 
produced from HEK293 cells stably transduced with pAIP-hGMCSF-co or pAIP-hIL4-co, 
respectively, as previously described (Reinhard et al., 2014), with each cytokine supernatant 
added at a dilution of 1:100.
Plasmid DNA—Ebola virus glycoprotein from the Guinean reference strain (NCBI 
Accession #KJ660346.2) was synthesized as a gBlock (Integrated DNA Technologies, 
Coralville, IA). It was engineered to lack the mucin domain (amino acids 309–489) 
(Chandran et al., 2005b) and to contain an additional adenosine at nucleotide 890, a 
modification that substitutes for the transcriptional editing that bona fide EBOV uses to 
produce full-length glycoprotein (Sanchez et al., 1996). This sequence contained flanking 
NcoI and XbaI restriction enzyme sites and was cloned into a mammalian expression vector 
under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early (CMV IE) promoter/enhancer. 
Into this construct, A82V, T230A, and D637G single amino acid substitutions as well as 
A82V/T230A double and A82V/T230A/D637G triple amino acid substitutions were 
generated by QuikChange mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), 
substituting in Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with GC Buffer (New England 
Biolabs, Ipswich MA). The following primers were utilized for generating these mutations: 
A82V F: 5′-CAACTGACGTGCCATCTGTGACTAAAAGATGGGGCTTC-3′, A82V R: 
5′-GAAGCCCCATCTTTTAGTCACAGATGGCACGTCAGTTG-3′, T230A F: 5′-
CCGGTTTTGGAACTAATGAGGCAGAGTACTTGTTCGAGG-3′, T230A R: 5′-
CCTCGAACAAGTACTCTGCCTCATTAGTTCCAAAACCGG-3′, D637G F: 5′-
GATAAAACCCTTCCGGGCCAGGGGGACAATGACAATTG-3′, and D637G R: 5′-
CAATTGTCATTGTCCCCCTGGCCCGGAAGGGTTTTATC-3′. Additional derivatives of 
the ancestral and mutant glycoproteins were generated by removal of the stop codon (F: 5′-
CTGTATATGCAAATTTGTCTTTTCTAGAGTCGGGGCGGCC-3′, R: 5′-
GGCCGCCCCGACTCTAGAAAAGACAAATTTGCATATACAG-3′) and insertion of an 
XbaI-flanked C-terminal V5 tag synthesized as a gBlock (Integrated DNA Technologies).
Reporter Virus and Virus-like Particle Production—Viral stocks were generated by 
transfecting HEK293 cells using Mirus TransIT-LT1 lipid reagent, as follows (Mirus Bio, 
Madison, WI). 24 hrs prior to transfection 6 × 105 HEK293 cells were plated per well in 6-
well plates and transfected the following day with a total of 2,490 ng plasmid DNA using

 6.25 μl TransIT-LT1 reagent. For production of pseudotyped EGFP-expressing HIV: 1,250 
ng pNL-EGFP/CMV-WPREΔU3 (Diehl et al., 2008), 930 ng pCD/NL-BH*ΔΔΔ (Zhang et 
al., 2002), and 310 ng glycoprotein expression vector were utilized. For the production of 
pseudotyped ebola virus VLPs bearing beta-lactamase: 2,180 ng pcDNA3.1-Bla-VP40 (BEI 
Resources, Manassas, VA) (Manicassamy and Rong, 2009; Tscherne et al., 2010) and 310 
ng glycoprotein expression vector were utilized. Whenever VSV-G pseudotypes were 
generated pLP/VSVG (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) was used to do so. Vpx-containing 
SIV VLPs were produced by transfecting 2180 ng pSIV3+ (Negre et al., 2000) and 310 ng 
pLP/VSVG. Lentiviral VLPs for challenging DCs were produced by transfecting 2180 ng 
pCD/NL-BH*ΔΔΔ and 310 ng glycoprotein expression vector. In all cases, culture medium 
was changed 16 hrs post transfection. In most cases fresh DMEM/10% FBS was used, but 
MDDC culture medium was utilized when virus was to be used for MDDC transductions. A 
further 48 hrs after media change, viral supernatants were harvested, passed through a 0.45 
μm pore size filter, and stored at 4° C.
Virus Infectivity Assays—For all adherent cells, 16 hrs prior to transduction cells were 
seeded in 12 well plates at the following cell densities per well: HEK-293 1×105; U2OS, 
FRhK4, CRFK, and NIH/3T3 3×104; S008842, Vero, Cf2Th, and MDTF 2×104. Cells were 
then exposed to virus-containing medium in a total volume of 350 μl for approximately 16 
hrs at 37°C. In order to relieve a TRIM5α block to infection (Berthoux et al., 2005), 8μg/ml 
cyclosporine A was added to the culture medium of FRhK4 and Vero cell lines. After this 
time, virus containing media was replaced with fresh culture medium and cells were 
cultured an additional 48 to 72 hrs prior to harvest for flow cytometric analysis. For 
infection of THP-1 and human MDDCs, 5 × 105 cells were seeded per well of a 24-well 
plate at the time of infection and cells were exposed to virus-containing medium in a total 
volume of 200 μl for approximately 16 hrs at 37°C. For MDDC infec tions, Vpx-containing 
VLPs were also added to the medium, in order to overcome a SAMHD1 block to viral 
infection (Laguette et al., 2011). After overnight culture in the presence of virus, fresh 
culture medium was added and cells were cultured an additional 48 to 72 hrs prior to harvest 
for flow cytometric analysis.
Cells were harvested for flow cytometric analysis by trypsinization (all adherent lines) or 
scraping (MDDC), spun at 500 × g for 5 mins, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline 
without Ca2+ and Mg2+, supplemented with 2% FBS. Flow cytometry was conducted using 
the Accuri C6 system (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Data was analyzed using FlowJo 
software, Macintosh version 10.1 (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR). Infectivity of each mutant 
Ebola virus GP was compared to that observed with the ancestral GP, under the same 
conditions.
Infectivity Assay Using EBOV Virion Cores—Pseudotyped Ebola virus β-lactamase-
VP40 (Bla-VP40) VLPs were prepared as described above. U2OS cells were seeded at a 
density of 1 × 105 cells per well in 96-well plates 16 hrs prior to infection. For infections, 
growth medium was replaced with cold Bla-VP40 VLP-containing medium and incubated 
for 2 hrs on ice. Virus containing medium was then removed and cells were washed once 
with ice cold Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) and the cells were then incubated for 2

 hrs at 37° C in HBSS containing 10% FBS. Cells were then washed once with ice cold 
HBSS and loaded with the CCF4-AM substrate, according to the manufacturer’s protocol 
(ThermoFisher) with the following modifications: the inhibitor of anion transport, 
probenecid, was added to a final concentration of 250 μM and cells were incubated with 
CCF4-AM substrate overnight at 11° C. Cleavage of the CCF4-AM substra te was assessed 
using the Synergy 2 plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT) with the following filter settings 
for the cleaved substrate: 400/30 excitation and 460/40 emission. The amount of CCF4-AM 
cleavage in cells infected with each mutant Ebola virus GP was compared to that observed 
for the ancestral GP, similar to what was done for infectivity assays.
Analysis of Clinical Data—In total there were 1,636 observations for which we had 
genotype information. Of these, only 194 cases were associated with both clinical outcome 
and C(t) value (viral load) information (Carroll et al., 2015b; Gire et al., 2014b; Quick et al., 
2016b). As the vast majority of these cases were from Guinea, we further restricted our 
attention to these 179 Guinean samples, as we did not want to introduce biases based on 
potential differences in the health care infrastructure or sample handling/processing. The 179 
Guinean cases were used for all model fitting analyses. Maps depicting the spatial 
distribution of genotypes for all isolates and those associated with clinical outcome and viral 
load data were constructed using the maptools package (Bivand and Lewin-Koh, 2016). To 
obtain raw odds ratios, we tallied the number of individuals infected with genotype GP-
A82V that died (a) and survived (b) and likewise for cases of individuals infected with 
genotype GP-A82 that died (c) and survived (d). The estimate for the raw odds ratio is then 
m = ad/bc. To compute confidence interval we calculated exp(m ± 1.96*S), where 
.
It is important, however, to control for the effect of other variables that might influence 
outcome in order to obtain adjusted odds ratios for the variable of interest (in this case, 
genotype). For each case we recorded the date of occurrence (in days since December 2013) 
and also the cumulative number of cases in the location of the case up to the date in which it 
was reported (cumCases). The idea behind acquiring this information was to detect any 
time-dependent trend in case fatality rates, as well as an overwhelming of the health care 
system due to a high case loads. We fit a binomial generalized linear model to the outcome 
data using these covariates in addition to C(t) values and the absence/presence of the A82V 
mutation (genotype). In order to make coefficient estimates consistent between the 
continuous variables and the binary variable, we standardized the continuous variables by 
subtracting the mean and dividing by two standard deviations (Gelman, 2008). To facilitate 
interpretation of the results, we flipped the sign of the resulting variable such that it was 
consistent with viral load (which is inversely related to C(t)).
To further assess the effect of potential confounding variables, we fitted a varying-intercept 
(also called “random effects”) model to the data where we assigned each location an 
intercept using the glmer() function in the lme4 package (Bates et al., 2015). This amounts 
to stating that each location was allowed to have its own baseline fatality rate. We also 
allowed each location to have its own coefficient for the cumCases variables, such that the 
structure of the model allowed for variability in how locations responded to demand for

 health care. Exploration of the model showed no association between sampling date and 
outcome and this variable was subsequently dropped of the model. The estimates for a 
model including C(t) values and genotype as “fixed effects” and cumCases are varying effect 
are presented in Figure S3 and show considerable uncertainty. We thus decided to make our 
inferences based on a simpler model, using only the fixed effect variables: C(t) and 
genotype.
A comparison of C(t) values per genotype was performed using a Student t test. Using all 
data for which C(t) values and genotype information was available (regardless of outcome 
information) we obtained 97 C(t) measurements for genotype GP-82A and 216 
measurements for genotype GP-A82V. The results are reported in the main text and indicate 
no significant association between viral load (as measured by C(t)) and genotype.
All analyses were carried out in R 3.2.4 (R Core Team, 2016) and figures were produced 
using the ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2009).
Western Blots—For determination of Ebola virus GP incorporation into viral particles 
HEK293 cells were transfected according to the procedure above substituting plasmids 
encoding C-terminally V5-tagged Ebola virus GPs for the corresponding untagged versions. 
The V5-tagged constructs did indeed have the same phenotype as the untagged constructs 
(data not shown). 48 hrs after media change, viral supernatant was harvested, passed through 
a 0.45μm filter, and layered over a 25% sucrose cushion. Virus was pelleted through the 
sucrose cushion by spinning at 125,000 × g using SW55Ti buckets in an Optima XE-90 
ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN). Supernatant was removed and viral 
pellets were gently washed with 1 ml ice cold PBS. Virus was then lysed in Hypotonic Lysis 
Buffer: 20 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.1% 
Triton-X 100, and cOmplete mini protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). 
Concomitantly, transfected cells were washed once with ice cold PBS and lysed in 
Hypotonic Lysis Buffer for 20 mins on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 
20 mins at 4°C. Cell lysate supernat ant was transferred to new tubes and insoluble pellets 
were discarded. In preparation for SDS-PAGE fractionation, viral and cellular lysates were 
mixed 1:1 with 2× Laemmli buffer containing 355 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 
mins.
Prepared samples were run on 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to 
nitrocellulose membranes. Membrane blocking, as well as both primary and secondary 
antibody binding were performed using TBS Odyssey Blocking Buffer (Li-Cor, Lincoln, 
NE), in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The V5 tag was detected using 
rabbit polyclonal serum (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) at a 1:4,000 dilution. HIV-1 
lentiviral CA (p24) was detected using mouse monoclonal antibody 183-H12-5C (Chesebro 
et al., 1992) at a 1:1,000 dilution. For imaging on the Li-Cor Odyssey CLx system (Li-Cor), 
primary antibody was recognized by goat anti-rabbit-680 and goat anti-mouse-800 (Li-Cor), 
both at 1:10,000 dilutions. Blots were scanned at a resolution of 84 μM using the ‘medium 
quality’ setting and quantitation of specific bands was done using the box tool in the 
Odyssey software package. Background subtraction was performed using pixels 
immediately adjacent to each box as reference background levels.

 Protein Structure Modeling—Three-dimensional protein structure analysis, target-
template alignments, and comparative homology modeling between human NPC1 bound to 
EBOV GPcl (experimentally derived by (Wang et al., 2016), Protein Data Bank accession 
number PDB: 5F1B) and targeted NPC1 loop 2 amino acid substitutions were performed 
using ICM-Pro version 3.8–5 (MolSoft, San Diego, CA; (Abagyan et al., 1994)).
QUANTITATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Experimental n values, and information regarding what this refers to, can be found in the 
figure legends. Viral infectivity data for each cell line was independently assessed for 
statistical significance using Repeated Measures ANOVA, with values obtained from unique 
viral stocks being the variable considered for repeated measures. For repeated measures 
ANOVAs, a Dunnett’s post-test for multiple comparisons was applied, where infectivity for 
all derivative GPs was compared to that of the ancestral GP. EBOV VLP fusion data was 
assessed for statistical significance using One-way Anova, with Bartlett’s post-test 
comparing all derivative GPs to the ancestral GP. All ANOVAs were performed using 
PRISM 5 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).

 Highlights
•
Ebola glycoprotein mutant GP-A82V arose early and dominated the 
West African epidemic
•
GP-A82V infects human cells more efficiently than does the ancestral 
glycoprotein
•
The increased infectivity of GP-A82V is specific for primate cells
•
GP-A82V was weakly associated with increased mortality during the 
epidemic

 Figure 2. GP-A82V enhances EBOV infectivity in human cells
(A–C) Lentiviral virions bearing a GFP transgene and pseudotyped with ancestral EBOV 
Makona GP or the indicated GP variants were produced by transfection of HEK293 cells 
and used to transduce U2OS cells (A), HEK293 cells (B), or MDDCs (C). GFP positive cells 
resulting from transduction with variant GPs were quantified by flow cytometry and 
normalized to the ancestral GP using lentivirions produced in parallel.
(D) Western blots (upper panels) of enriched lentiviral particles pseudotyped with C-
terminally V5-tagged EBOV GPs probed with anti-V5 and anti-p24 antibodies. Bar-graph 
showing EBOV GP1 + 2 signal intensity relative to that observed for the corresponding 
lentiviral capsid (p24).
Data in panels A and B, each data point represents a normalized transduction using lentiviral 
stocks derived from independent transfections. Data in panel C data points represent 
independent experiments with four independent viral stocks and eight different human 
donors. * p<0.05; ** p<0.001; *** p<0.001; repeated measures ANOVA with Dunnett’s

 Figure 3. EBOV GP-A82V enhances the ability of EBOV virion cores to fuse with target cell 
cytoplasm
Virus-like particles (VLPs) were generated with EBOV VP40-βVirus-like particles (VLPs) 
were generated with EBOV VP40-β-lactamase fusion protein and either the ancestral EBOV 
GP or one of the indicated mutants. U2OS cells were incubated with VLP-containing 
supernatant for 2 hrs at 4° C, then for 2 hrs at 37° C, and then loaded with CCF4-AM 
overnight at 11° C. Cleavage of CCF4-AM was measured using a fluorescent plate reader 
with 400/30 excitation and 460/40 emission filters. Signal for cleaved CCF4-AM signal for 
all EBOV GPs was compared to that observed with the ancestral EBOV GP.
Data are means ± SEM (n = 6 viral infections) from a representative experiment. * p<0.05; 
** p<0.01; *** p<0.001; N.S. p>0.05; one-way ANOVA with Burnett’s post-test comparing

 Figure 5. Comparative structural analysis of the EBOV GP-A82V substitution and NPC1 
orthologues
(A) Structural overview of EBOV GP2 (yellow) and cleaved GP (GPcl, light blue) bound to 
human NPC1 (orange), as experimentally derived by (Wang et al., 2016). The EBOV GP-
A82V substitution (red) occurs in the α1 helix of proteolytically cleaved GP that interacts 
with NPC1 loop 2.
(B–C) Zoom of the (B) ancestral GP-A82 (blue) and (C) derived GP-V82 (red) variants in 
relation to proximal amino acid side chains. The distance between R85 and E178 is close 
enough (i.e., < 4 Å) where a salt bridge is possible.
(D–E) NPC1 loop 2 amino acid (D) sequence alignments and (E) target-template homology 
models of cell species used in this study (rodents, green; other mammals, cyan; Figure 4) 
and bats (purple) compared to primates (orange). Highlighted in panel (C) are the amino 
acid differences in loop 2 from the target species compared to the template, humans, and 
their location compared to the GP-A82V variant.

 Figure 6. Association between GP-A82V and increased rate of lethal infection
(A–B) Spatial distribution of GP genotypes for all available EBOV Makona sequencing data 
(A) or Guinean isolates linked to information regarding clinical outcome and viral load (B). 
The data included in panel B were used in subsequent modeling analyses. (C) Association 
between patient viral load (as determined by C(t) values) and EVD-associated mortality. 
This analysis used all observations for which C(t) values were measured (n = 313).
(D) Viral load information (as determined by C(t) values) in individuals infected with EBOV 
encoding either ancestral or A82V GP. This analysis used all observations for which C(t) 
values were measured (A82: n = 97; V82: n = 216).
(E) Mortality data in individuals infected with EBOV encoding either ancestral or A82V GP.
(F) Depiction of the correlation between GP genotype and mortality, based on results of a 
binomial generalized linear model using C(t) values and GP genotype as covariates to 
predict case fatality rates over a range of viral loads (depicted by transformed C(t) values). 
C(t) values were transformed by subtracting the mean, dividing by two standard deviations 
and flipping the sign such that the value 0 in the graph corresponds to the average C(t) value 
and the transformed variable reflects viral load.
