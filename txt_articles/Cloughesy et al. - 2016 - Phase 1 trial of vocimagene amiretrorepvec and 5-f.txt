Toca 511 (vocimagene amiretrorepvec) is an investigational nonlytic, retroviral replicating vector (RRV) that delivers
a yeast cytosine deaminase, which converts subsequently administered courses of the investigational prodrug Toca
FC (extended-release 5-fluorocytosine) into the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil. Forty-five subjects with recurrent
or progressive high-grade glioma were treated. The end points of this phase 1, open-label, ascending dose,
multicenter trial included safety, efficacy, and molecular profiling; survival was compared to a matching
subgroup from an external control. Overall survival for recurrent high-grade glioma was 13.6 months (95%
confidence interval, 10.8 to 20.0) and was statistically improved relative to an external control (hazard ratio, 0.45;
P = 0.003). Tumor samples from subjects surviving more than 52 weeks after Toca 511 delivery disproportionately
displayed a survival-related mRNA expression signature, identifying a potential molecular signature that may correlate
with treatment-related survival rather than being prognostic. Toca 511 and Toca FC show excellent tolerability, with
RRV persisting in the tumor and RRV control systemically. The favorable assessment of Toca 511 and Toca FC sup-
ports confirmation in a randomized phase 2/3 trial (NCT02414165).
INTRODUCTION
High-grade gliomas (HGGs), including glioblastomas and anaplastic
astrocytomas, are the most aggressive malignant brain tumors (1).
Treatments for recurrent glioblastoma are associated with an overall
survival (OS) of 7.1 to 9.8 months (2–6). Patients generally suffer
considerable morbidity from the underlying disease, including seizures,
peritumoral edema, venous thromboembolism, fatigue, cognitive dys-
function, and depression. There are few therapeutic options for recur-
rent HGG, and the improvement in care over the last several decades
has lagged behind nearly all other malignant tumors.
Toca 511 (vocimagene amiretrorepvec) is an investigational non-
lytic, retroviral replicating vector (RRV) (7). As an RRV based on a gam-
maretrovirus with an amphotropic envelope, Toca 511 infects human
cells with selectivity for cancer cells because genome integration is
dependent on cell division and viral replication is normally restricted
by innate and adaptive immune responses that are defective in malig-
nant tissues (8–10). Toca 511 spreads through cancer cells and stably
delivers a codon-optimized yeast cytosine deaminase (CD) gene
whose protein product converts courses of the prodrug Toca FC [an
investigational extended-release version of 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC)] into
5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU is a canonical chemotherapeutic that has a
poor therapeutic index for the treatment of brain tumors, unlike 5-FC,
which is commonly used to treat fungal infections of the brain and
more efficiently crosses the blood brain barrier (7, 11, 12). In addition
to direct killing of cells by production of intracellular 5-FU, Toca 511
and Toca FC therapy also operates through metabolic cooperation, in
which noninfected but dividing neighboring cells are killed through
the transfer of the antimetabolite 5-FU from nearby CD-expressing
cells. This type of bystander effect has been associated with CD and
5-FC because 5-FU is a small molecule capable of diffusion through
cellular membranes (13, 14). Furthermore, 5-FU has direct cytotoxic
effects on myeloid-derived suppressor cells located in glioblastoma
tumors (15). Because 5-FU is generated directly within infected tumors
and its half-life is short, adverse effects of systemic chemotherapy,
such as myelotoxicity, are avoided. This also enables the immune
system to remain intact, preserving the capacity to develop antitumor
immune responses. In vivo studies demonstrated that Toca 511 and
5-FC treatment stimulates a local and systemic immune response against
the tumor (8, 16).
This phase 1 trial (NCT01470794) includes subjects with HGG
that have recurred after treatment with at least subtotal resection,
postoperative radiation, and temozolomide. This trial evaluated com-
bination therapy, consisting of surgical resection followed by in-
creasing doses of Toca 511 administered under direct visualization
by multiple injections using a blunt-tipped needle into the walls of
the resection cavity. This method of administration has been used in
previous gene transfer studies and has generally been well tolerated

 (17). About 6 weeks after Toca 511 injection and consequent viral
replication, just before Toca FC administration, subjects underwent
evaluation, including radiological assessment by magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and neurological examination. Subjects
were subsequently treated with Toca FC administered for 7 days
every 4 to 8 weeks in repeat cycles until radiological tumor progression
or clinical progression. Some subjects received Toca FC beyond tumor
progression. Here, we report the results of the phase 1 study including
safety, OS, objective response rate by independent radiology review,
progression-free survival, and putative biomarker identification. To
provide context to the results observed, the OS and safety profile of
subjects with glioblastoma in first or second recurrence, who were
treated with Toca 511 and Toca FC, were compared to an external
control of matched subjects who received standard therapy with
lomustine (6).
RESULTS
Subjects
Between February 2012 and May 2015 across seven medical centers,
45 subjects were enrolled and treated with Toca 511. As of 18 Septem-
ber 2015, 43 subjects, considered the efficacy evaluable population, re-
ceived at least one planned course of Toca FC (fig. S1 and table S1).
Most of the subjects were diagnosed with glioblastoma (82.2%). Their
median age was 56 years, with first (51.1%), second (22.3%), or >2
(26.6%) recurrences and a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of
70 to 80 (24.5%) or 90 to 100 (75.5%). All subjects had previously
received radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide (table
S2). Most of these recurrent HGGs were located in the cerebral hemi-
spheres, including the frontal, temporal, parietal, or occipital lobes. Al-
though it was not confirmed by a comparison of the preoperative and
immediate postoperative MRI scans, the estimated percentage of tumor
resection in most of the cases was 80 to 100%. Subjects were treated with
Toca 511 from 1.4 × 107 to 4.8 × 109 transducing units and with Toca FC
from 130 to 220 mg/kg per day (table S3), generating concentrations of
5-FU known to be effective in cultured cells and in vivo (8, 18).
Efficacy
Treatment with Toca 511 resulted in viral transduction of tumor cells,
as demonstrated by detection of Toca 511 DNA and expression of
Toca 511 RNA and CD protein in resected recurred tumor samples
after Toca 511 delivery and several cycles of Toca FC (table S4 and
fig. S2). In the efficacy evaluable population, OS for recurrent HGG
subjects (n = 43) was 13.6 months [95% confidence interval (CI),
10.8 to 20.0], and that for HGG subjects at first or second recurrence
was 14.4 months (95% CI, 11.3 to 32.3) (Table 1). OS for glioblastoma
subjects was 11.6 months (95% CI, 9.2 to 14.6), and that for glioblas-
toma subjects at first or second recurrence was 13.6 months (95% CI,
11.1 to 20.0). In the efficacy evaluable population, landmark survival
data included OS at 6 months (OS6) (87.9%), OS9 (72.4%), OS12
(52.5%), and OS24 (29.1%). In an analysis comparing the higher-dose
cohorts (cohorts 4 to 7a) with the lower-dose cohorts (cohorts 1 to 3),
there was a trend for dose response in survival [hazard ratio (HR),
0.56; 95% CI, 0.26 to 1.20] for the higher-dose cohort with median
survival of 14.4 months (95% CI, 10.8 to not reached) versus the
lower-dose cohort with median survival of 11.8 months (95% CI,
6.7 to 16.8) (Fig. 1A). Progression-free survival was 3.2 months (95%
CI, 3.0 to 3.4), and progression-free survival at 6 months was 16.3%.
Evidence of potential pseudoprogression in resected tumors after
Toca 511 and Toca FC treatment was observed (fig. S3).
Evaluating tumor response in the postoperative setting requires
careful analysis because subjects may have evaluable but not measur-
able disease. On the basis of an independent radiology review, best
overall response included complete response (4.7%, in two subjects with
anaplastic astrocytoma), partial response (4.7%, in two subjects with
glioblastoma), an objective response rate (9.3%), stable disease rate
(18.6%), and a clinical benefit rate (27.9%) (table S5). The objective
response rate (13.3%), stable disease rate (23.3%), and clinical benefit
rate (36.7%) were seen in the higher-dose cohorts. Two subjects with
anaplastic astrocytoma were reported by an independent radiology re-
view to have a complete response with a duration of response of more
than 1 year. Concerted efforts were made to approach six sponsors of
randomized phase 2 and 3 trials, including trials with surgical resection
of recurrent glioblastoma. One sponsor of a phase 3 trial agreed to share
data from subjects in the control arm, who were treated with lomustine.
Efficacy evaluable subjects with glioblastoma at first and second recur-
rence were compared to the external control lomustine-treated subjects
who met eligibility criteria of a phase 3 trial, potentially identifying a less
ill population than typicalhistoricalcontrols(Table 2). The study subjects
and the external control lomustine studies were nearly contemporaneous
(study subjects, 2012–2015; lomustine, 2006–2010).

 The demographics of the study subjects
with glioblastoma at first and second re-
currence and lomustine control were com-
parable, although data were not available
to match the subjects for enhancing tu-
mor volume at the start of treatment with
lomustine. The lomustine control had a
slightly younger population, more sub-
jects in first recurrence and fewer subjects
requiring corticosteroids at baseline,
whereas the Toca 511 and Toca FC trial
had a higher percentage of subjects with
a KPS of 90 to 100. Median OS for study
subjects was 13.6 months (95% CI, 11.1
to 20) compared to 7.1 months (95% CI,
6.01 to 8.80) for the lomustine control.
The OS HR was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.27 to
0.77; P = 0.003). The separation of the
curves occurred initially with OS6 of
96.0% versus 61.8% (P < 0.001) and
continued through 30 months (Fig.
1B and Table 3). Analysis of survival
comparing time from initial diagnosis
shows a median OS at 29.2 months for
study subjects (95% CI, 19.6 to 47.2)
compared to 21.3 months for lomustine
control (95% CI, 17.0 to 25.2). The OS
HR was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.32 to 0.93; P =
0.025) (Fig. 1C). A forest plot for sub-
groups showed improved survival for
study subjects in all subgroups (fig. S4).
During the trial, increases were ob-
served in total circulating CD4-positive
T cell counts over the course of treatment
(fig. S5). The increase in CD4-positive
T cells more than 21 weeks after delivery
of Toca 511 was significant (P = 0.019)
compared to the start of therapy using Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
Adverse events
The median duration of treatment with Toca FC was two cycles
(range, one to seven cycles). About 35% of the subjects on this trial
received Toca FC on a continuation protocol of cycles of 7 days every
6 weeks (range, 1 to 14 cycles). Toca FC serum concentrations
increased in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2). Toca 511 and Toca
FC treatment produced few related adverse events and serious adverse
events (table S6). Two dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed:

 one in cohort 3 of grade 3 asthenia, which was possibly related to Toca
511, and one in cohort 5a of grade 3 normal pressure hydrocephalus,
which was considered unrelated. A maximum tolerated dose was not
reached. There were no treatment-related deaths. Additionally, safety
analyses were conducted comparing adverse event profiles in glioblas-
toma study subjects in the first and second recurrence subgroup to the
lomustine external control. Subjects treated with Toca 511 and Toca
FC had fewer related treatment-emergent grade ≥3 adverse events
(3.7% versus 36.9%) (Table 4). There were far fewer grade ≥3 adverse
events and a virtual absence of hematologic toxicity for study subjects
relative to the lomustine control, where grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia
occurred in 23.8% of lomustine patients (table S7). Given that Toca 511
issurgically delivered, the treatment-emergent adverse events regard-
less of attribution were also reported, including grade 2 incision site
pain (25.9%) and procedural pain (18.5%) (table S8). These results dem-
onstrate a more favorable safety profile with fewer severe toxicities
for Toca 511 and Toca FC compared to lomustine. To date, there has
been no persistent viremia observed; Toca 511 virus in blood appears
to be well controlled and cleared quickly (fig. S6).
mRNA expression profiles associated with survival after
Toca 511 and Toca FC therapy
HGG is molecularly heterogeneous, with several subtypes classically
defined by histology and more recently through mRNA expression
and genomic mutation profiles (19). Variability in the underlying
tumor molecular features resulting in differences in virus-host interac-
tions, 5-FU–induced cell death, and immune activation are expected to
contribute to the differential benefit derived from Toca 511 and Toca
FC, as measured by OS. Therefore, we systematically profiled tumor
RNA expression from frozen tissue biopsies, taken at the time of tumor
resection and immediately before Toca 511 administration, by next-
generation sequencing. Available RNA from two or three spatially
distinct pieces was isolated from biopsies to gauge intratumor hetero-
geneity. A total of 64 available tumor samples were tested from 26
efficacy evaluable subjects. To gauge variation in mRNA expression
across tumors, the 4314 mRNAs with the greatest variation in expres-
sion (SD, >0.8) were identified, and their relative expression was used
as a metric of similarity for unsupervised hierarchical clustering (Fig. 3).
In this analysis, subject samples clustered into four groups (color-coded)
based on expression of functionally related sets of mRNAs (sets 1 to 5).
As expected, most of the grade 3 samples clustered together (gray). In
the purple-coded group, 76% of tumor samples (13 of 17) came from
five of eight glioblastoma subjects who lived more than 1 year after Toca
511 and Toca FC therapy. Tumor samples preferentially expressed
mRNAs encoding proteins involved in neuronal functions, which we
termed survival-related neuronal subtype (SRNS) and is represented
in the purple branch in Fig. 3.
Previous studies by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium
have shown that HGG RNA expression profiles from newly diagnosed
tumors reproducibly segregate samples into four molecular classes,
coinciding with specific genomic alterations and cell types of origin:
“classical” astrocytes, “mesenchymal” microglia, “proneural” oligo-
dendrocytes, and “neural” neuron-like cells (19, 20). To determine
whether this classification was applicable to recurrent HGG, for which
there is a paucity of published genomic data sets, we hierarchically
clustered study samples using a molecular classification gene set
provided by TCGA consortium for newly diagnosed HGG (fig. S7).
Samples were clustered into four groups, coinciding with the defined
molecular classes: neural (n = 19), mesenchymal (n = 14), proneural
(n = 14), and classical (n = 4) (Fig. 4A). Most grade 3 samples were pro-
neural (n = 10/14), consistent with published results on newly diag-
nosed tumors (Fig. 4B) (21). Samples showed differing ranges of
intratumor heterogeneity (fig. S8) (22), which was not attributable to
RNA quality or sequencing coverage (fig. S9). In 23 of 26 efficacy
evaluable subjects, most of the samples corresponded to a specific
subtype, but 8 of these 23 subjects displayed multiple subtypes within
their tumor (Fig. 4C), underscoring the heterogeneity maintainedin recur-
rent HGG. A multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the HR

 of death of the neural signature is significantly reduced compared to
other subtypes (HR, 0.11; P = 0.01) after controlling for the number of
recurrences and HGG grade (table S9). However, the TCGA neural
signature is not a prognostic marker for survival in newly diag-
nosed HGG, where typically, only the G-CIMP phenotype confers
a survival advantage (fig. S10). G-CIMP refers to glioblastoma tumors
that are proneural and also have glioma-CpG island methylator phe-
notype (23).
The SRNS identified in recurrent glioblastoma tumors via un-
supervised hierarchical clustering (Fig. 3) bears functional similarities
to the TCGA neural subtype identified in newly diagnosed HGG
tumors. To more precisely classify subjects via the SRNS and its rela-
tionship to the neural subtype signature, we hierarchically clustered
samples on the basis of the expression of the 890 mRNAs in cluster
5 from Fig. 3 (fig. S11A). Tumors from subjects who survived at least
1 year after Toca 511 treatment disproportionately displayed the SRNS
(19 of 21) (fig. S11B). Using the first bifurcation of the dendrogram to
separate SRNS from non-SRNS, 28 of 50 samples from efficacy evalu-
able glioblastoma subjects were SRNS (fig. S11A), including 18 of
19 tumors defined as neural and 4 of 4 tumors defined as classical
(fig. S11C). The HR of death of those with SRNS was significantly
reduced compared to non-SRNS (HR, 0.11, P = 0.003) after controlling
for the number of recurrences and HGG grade using a multivariate
Cox regression analysis (table S10). Like the TCGA neural signature,
the SRNS signature is not associated with survival in newly diagnosed
glioblastoma (fig. S12).
A recent study compared expression profiles of glioblastoma tumors
from the contrast-enhancing tumor core (CE) with the leading edge
nonenhancing (NE) margins of the tumors (24). Samples from CE re-
sembled classical, mesenchymal, and proneural subtypes, whereas
samplesfromNE largely resembledthe neuraltype.The raw sequencing
data from this study were retrieved and processed identically to the
samples from the Toca 511 and Toca FC study and then combined. Neu-
ral tumors were segregated with NE samples and normal brain, whereas
classical, mesenchymal, and proneural samples were intermixed with
CE samples (fig. S13A). Neural tumor samples were distinct from normal
brain, including alterations in mRNA expression of genes involved in
proliferation (fig. S13B).
Separate from the SRNS signature, there were numerous mRNAs
whose expression correlated with survival time. For instance, expression
of SPOC1/PHF13 negatively correlates (Pearson correlation, −0.71)
with survival after Toca 511 therapy in glioblastoma patients (fig.
S14). SPOC1 (survival-time associated PHD protein in ovarian cancer
1) modulates chromatin structure, acts as an adenovirus host restriction
factor, and therefore has the potential to interfere with the retroviral
life cycle (25, 26).
O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) encodes a
DNA repair protein that repairs alkylation at the O6 position of guanine
(27). MGMT promoter hypermethylation reduces its expression and
impairs the cells’ ability to repair damage induced by chemotherapeutic
agents and radiation (28, 29). Accordingly, MGMT promoter hyper-
methylation is associated with improved outcome in newly diagnosed
HGG (30). MGMT promoter methylation was measured with a bisulfite-
free DNA methylation detection assay (31). Most study samples were
MGMT methylation–negative, but there were three instances where
MGMT methylation status differed between two distinct samples from
the same tumor (fig. S15A). Unlike SRNS, MGMT methylation status
did not correlate with survival (fig. S15B).
DISCUSSION
Recurrent HGG is associated with dismal clinical outcomes, and pa-
tients are in need of safe and more efficacious therapy. The nonlytic
RRV Toca 511 and an extended-release 5-FC have the potential to fill
this medical need. Detection of viral transduction in resected tumors
after Toca 511 treatment, despite it being cleared from blood, suggests

 that a reservoir of Toca 511 may exist
selectively in tumors to continually kill
tumor cells and activate the immune sys-
tem over multiple cycles of Toca FC (8).
Cancer selectivity for Toca 511 is sup-
ported by the lack of virus staining in
areas of normal brain tissue included
in the tumor resection after Toca 511
delivery and has been well established
in preclinical tumor models (8, 10).
To provide context to the results ob-
served, we compared our data to the only
available contemporaneous randomized
phase 2/3 external controls. Subjects with
glioblastoma at first and second recur-
rence treated with Toca 511 and Toca
FC were compared to those treated with
lomustine. Although such a comparison
does not overcome the lack of an internal
control and randomized patient assign-
ment, it is considered robust, reflecting
a phase 3 clinical trial patient population and establishing comparability
to the subjects receiving Toca 511 and Toca FC. Efficacy is strongly
suggested in the Toca 511– and Toca FC–treated recurrent HGG pop-
ulation by almost twofold improvement in OS compared to this ex-
ternal control and by a median OS of 13.6 months that approaches the
OS observed in newly diagnosed glioblastoma (32, 33). Although Toca
511 and Toca FC are administered after tumor resection and lomus-
tine is not, a similar effect was seen in another phase 1 Toca 511 trial,
which did not require surgical resection (34). The improvement in OS
is not reflected by an improvement in progression-free survival, which
may be attributable to radiological changes of pseudoprogression as
has been observed with immunotherapies for HGG (35). Although
evaluating tumor response in the postoperative setting and in the
context of a potentially immune-activating therapy presents challenges,
longer follow-up of 30 evaluable subjects in the higher-dose cohorts
demonstrated that 2 had complete responses, 2 had partial responses,
and 8 had stable disease, which provides additional supportive evidence
of efficacy. The safety profile appears manageable, but further attribu-
tion of the adverse events observed as complications of surgery, Toca
511, and/or Toca FC treatment will need to be assessed in a randomized
trial. There were no reports of spontaneous cases of autoimmune dis-
orders, such as vitiligo, thyroiditis, or hypophysitis, which have been ob-
served with the immune checkpoint inhibitors anti–CTLA-4 (cytotoxic
T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4) and anti–PD-1 (programmed cell
death protein 1).
The improvement in OS and a favorable safety profile of Toca 511
and Toca FC support moving forward with this treatment regimen. In
the external control comparison, there was a separation of the OS
curves that occurred initially and continued through 30 months with
an OS24 of 31.6%. This is consistent with an initial cytoreductive effect
from intratumorally generated 5-FU, followed by a sustained effect
from augmented antitumor immunity resulting from a combination
of cancer and immunosuppressor cell killing by 5-FU in the tumor
microenvironment (8, 36). A maximum tolerated dose has not been
established because DLTs were infrequent. A randomized trial
(NCT02414165) is being conducted at a maximum feasible dose of
4 ml using 40 injections into the wall of the resection cavity. As evi-
denced by immunohistochemistry and analysis of viral RNA and
DNA, Toca 511 successfully transduced recurrent HGG with selectivity
for tumor cells and was readily cleared from the subjects’ blood. The
documentation of tumor virus persistence with systemic clearance
supports the importance of further study of RRVs in humans for cancer
treatment. Although persistence of virus was shown in tumors that were
resected after Toca 511 treatment, it is not possible to estimate the
percentage of tumor that was transduced before resection in these
samples. These post–Toca 511–resected tumors received at least one
cycle of Toca FC, which is expected to kill most of the transduced cells
before resection occurred, so an accurate assessment of transduction
frequency by Toca 511 was not possible in this setting.
Toca 511 and Toca FC therapy increased the number of CD4+
T cells in the blood, suggesting that immunomodulatory activity may be
part of this therapy. In addition to the adjuvant properties of a replicat-
ing virus (Toca 511) and cancer cell killing by 5-FU, myeloid-derived
suppressor cells are known to be sensitive to 5-FU, and the changes in
immune cell populations in the blood may result from the induction of
an antitumor response generated by Toca 511 and Toca FC (15).
Our molecular analyses reinforce the heterogeneity of HGG tumors
including MGMT methylation, a prognostic factor that may sensitize
cells to 5-FU (37, 38). These results indicate the importance of obtaining
measurements of multiple spatially distinct tumor biopsy samples when
prognostic determinations can potentially affect treatment decisions.
The underlying prognostic and predictive molecular features that
contribute to survival in this study may identify subjects most likely to
benefit from Toca 511 and Toca FC therapy and suggest pathways to
further improve treatment. MGMT promoter methylation did not
explain variation in survival among treated subjects with glioblastoma
at first or second recurrence. Subjects whose tumors displayed the
SRNS (and TCGA neural subtype) survived significantly longer than
subjects whose tumors displayed other subtypes (SRNS, P = 0.003;
TCGA, P = 0.01). In principle, subjects with SRNS could have a less
aggressive, more differentiated tumor or a more successful surgery and
thus live longer. However, neither the SRNS nor the related TCGA
neural subtype correlates with survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma,
suggesting that SRNS tumor phenotype predicts response to Toca 511

 and Toca FC therapy (21, 23). Our results are consistent with the
SRNS signature being associated with the nonenhancing region of
advancing edge of the tumor (24). This environment may be more
favorable for Toca 511 persistence and spread because the advancing
edges are associated with increased cell division, which is important
for Toca 511 infection and 5-FU killing (39). A recent clinical trial
reported encouraging survival in recurrent HGG transcranially
injected with Toca 511 into the nonenhancing edge of a glioma using
a biopsy needle compared to infusion into the center of the tumor
(34). Expression of a known virus-host interaction viral restriction
factor, SPOC1, has a strong negative correlation with survival after
treatment with Toca 511 and Toca FC, supporting the importance
of Toca 511 tumor spread for survival improvement.
Two meta-analyses have demonstrated that surgical resection of
recurrent tumor does not affect OS (40, 41). Adverse events will be
understood more clearly from a randomized trial of Toca 511 and
Toca FC in combination with surgical resection, which is currently
ongoing (NCT02414165).
Use of Toca 511 and Toca FC after glioma resection may be an
optimal setting for testing this immunotherapy treatment. Typically,
neurosurgeons try to resect enhancing tumor, leaving behind non-
enhancing tumor in the resection cavity wall. Toca 511 can then be
injected into the nonenhancing region left behind in the advancing
edge of the tumor where the SRNS cells likely reside.
A randomized phase 2/3 trial (NCT02414165) in subjects with
recurrent glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma is under way.
This trial will compare the OS of subjects treated with Toca 511
combined with Toca FC to subjects treated according to standard
of care after tumor resection. This design provides an opportunity
to validate the promising OS, tolerability, immune cell changes, and
mRNA expression signature observed in this phase 1 study and to
quantify cytotoxic and immune-mediated effects in an effort to further
confirm the mechanism of action of Toca 511 and Toca FC. It is con-
ceivable that treatment with Toca 511 at the time of resection of newly
diagnosed HGG may provide better efficiency of treatment, and this
will further explored in another phase 1 trial (NCT02598011).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Eligible patients had histologically proven HGG with recurrence or
progression after initial definitive therapy or therapy for recurrence.
Other key eligibility criteria included age between 18 and 80 years,
Karnofsky performance score ≥70, single recurrent HGG tumor ≤6 cm,
preoperative evaluation indicating that ≥80% of tumor was resectable,
and adequate organ function.
The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at
each site and complied with the International Ethical Guidelines for
Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, good clinical practice
guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, and local laws. All subjects
provided written informed consent.
This phase 1, open-label, ascending dose, multicenter trial was
designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Toca 511 and Toca
FC. The primary end point was to identify the highest, safe, and well-
tolerated dose of Toca 511. The secondary objective was to evaluate
safety and tolerability of repeated treatment with Toca FC at various
doses and schedules after administration of Toca 511. Efficacy was to
be assessed by OS, OS6, OS9, OS12, and OS24. We used an inde-
pendent radiology review (ICON Imaging) to determine objective
response rate, progression-free survival, and progression-free survival
at 6 months. Exploratory objectives included developing a predictive
diagnostic factor based on RNA expression and assessing potential
clinical utility. This was done in accordance with the SPIRIT (Stan-
dard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials)
2013 Guidelines.
Subjects underwent gadolinium-enhanced MRI scan of the brain
about every 8 weeks, with the baseline MRI scan obtained after surgical
resection and just before Toca FC. Tumor response was assessed by
an independent radiology review using the Macdonald criteria, which
require measurable contrast-enhancing disease of at least 10 mm in
both dimensions and confirmation at least 4 weeks after the initial
response (42).
All adverse events were classified and graded using the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (43). If any subject
experienced a DLT attributed to Toca 511, Toca FC, or the combina-
tion, then another three subjects would be studied at that dose level. If
two of six subjects experienced a related DLT at any dose level, then
no further dose escalation was planned. The highest dose at which six
subjects were studied with <2 DLTs would have been considered the
maximum tolerated dose. A data monitoring committee periodically
reviewed the safety data. Subjects were assessed for adverse events
from the time of Toca 511 administration and will be followed for
up to 15 years through a continuation study, as stipulated by U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance (44).
Testing for the presence of viral RNA by quantitative reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), viral DNA by quanti-
tative PCR, antibodies to Toca 511, and immunologic parameters was
performed in blood. Urine and saliva were monitored for viral
shedding.
Molecular analyses
Genomic DNA and total RNA from spatially distinct bulk tumor
pieces were isolated and analyzed further. Additional methodologic
details are provided in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Study oversight
The study was designed jointly by the investigators and representatives
of the sponsor, Tocagen. The sponsor collected and analyzed the data.
All the authors were involved in the data analysis and manuscript
preparation and vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data
and analyses and for the adherence of the study to the protocol. No
one who is not listed as an author contributed to the writing of the
manuscript.
External control
Tocagen approached six sponsors with recently published phase 2 or 3
data in recurrent HGG or glioblastoma, including a study in which
subjects underwent resection of recurrent glioblastoma. One sponsor
(Denovo Biopharma LLC) agreed to share lomustine data from a
phase 3 randomized, open-label study evaluating enzastaurin in
subjects with recurrent glioblastoma who did not undergo resection of
recurrent tumor. The study enrolled subjects meeting the following
criteria: ≥18 years of age; KPS ≥70; histologically confirmed glioblas-
toma at first or second recurrence; ≤2 previous chemotherapy regi-
mens; and adequate organ function. Although 92 subjects were

 randomized to lomustine, 84 received lomustine treatment. The study
was discontinued early for futility after an interim analysis of the
primary end point of progression-free survival (6). A subset of subjects
with recurrent glioblastoma at first or second recurrence treated with
Toca 511 and Toca FC was compared to these lomustine-treated
subjects.
Statistical analysis
The efficacy evaluable population included subjects who received at
least one dose of Toca 511 and one planned course of Toca FC. The
safety population included all subjects who received Toca 511. Con-
tinuous variables were summarized with means, SDs, medians,
minimums, and maximums. Categorical variables were summarized
by counts and by percentage of subjects in corresponding categories.
OS and progression-free survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-
Meier method, and plots were generated with the median OS and
progression-free survival and 95% CI summarized. The log-rank test
was used for between-group comparisons, and the HRs with 95% CI
were presented. In addition, Z test was used for between-group com-
parison in landmark survival rate at 6 (OS6), 9 (OS9), 12 (OS12),
and 24 months (OS24). All analyses were performed using SAS version
9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.). Molecular characteristics of neural subtypes
versus other subtypes and SRNS versus other subtypes were investigated
using a multivariate Cox regression model for prediction of survival.
For this ongoing trial, these analyses were performed on the basis of a
data transfer date of 18 September 2015. Additionally, an independent
radiology review (ICON Imaging) occurred on the basis of a data trans-
fer date of 22 January 2016.
