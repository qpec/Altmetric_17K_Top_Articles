Genetic diseases can be diagnosed early during pregnancy, but many monogenic disorders
continue to cause considerable neonatal and pediatric morbidity and mortality. Early inter-
vention through intrauterine gene editing, however, could correct the genetic defect,
potentially allowing for normal organ development, functional disease improvement, or cure.
Here we demonstrate safe intravenous and intra-amniotic administration of polymeric
nanoparticles to fetal mouse tissues at selected gestational ages with no effect on survival or
postnatal growth. In utero introduction of nanoparticles containing peptide nucleic acids
(PNAs) and donor DNAs corrects a disease-causing mutation in the β-globin gene in a mouse
model of human β-thalassemia, yielding sustained postnatal elevation of blood hemoglobin
levels into the normal range, reduced reticulocyte counts, reversal of splenomegaly, and
improved survival, with no detected off-target mutations in partially homologous loci. This
work may provide the basis for a safe and versatile method of fetal gene editing for human
monogenic disorders.

 E
very year, an estimated 8 million children are born world-
wide with severe genetic disorders or birth defects. Of these
diseases, hemoglobinopathies are the most commonly
inherited single-gene disorders, with a global carrier frequency of
over 5%1. Depending on the severity of the disease, children
affected by β-thalassemia may require lifelong transfusions or
bone marrow transplantation, which can lead to serious com-
plications such as iron overload, sepsis, or graft-versus-host dis-
ease. Recent advances in non–invasive genetic testing allow for
diagnosis of genetic disorders such as thalassemia early in
gestation2, providing a window during which genetic correction
could be pursued prior to birth. In utero gene therapy thus far has
focused on stem-cell transplantation and viral-mediated gene
delivery [reviewed in ref. 3,4], methodologies that do not allow for
correction of a gene in its endogenous environment. Considerable
advances in gene therapy approaches have occurred, but they still
face challenges associated with the use of viruses and with the risk
of ectopic integration into deleterious sites in the genome, issues
of particular concern for a developing fetus.
In the past decade, site-specific gene editing to correct disease-
causing mutations has emerged as an attractive approach to
ameliorate genetic diseases, with substantial effort directed at
development of nuclease-based editing tools such as CRISPR/
Cas9. As an alternative, our group has recently shown that gene
correction can be coordinated efficiently and safely in postnatal
animals via the intravenous or inhalational administration of
polymeric,
biodegradable
nanoparticles
(NPs)
loaded
with
triplex-forming peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) and single-stranded
donor DNAs5–7. The PNAs contain nucleobases supported by a
modified polyamide backbone8 and bind to their specific genomic
target site via both Watson−Crick and Hoogsteen base-pairing9,
yielding PNA/DNA/PNA triplex structures that induce endo-
genous DNA repair to mediate the recombination of the donor
DNA molecule containing the correct sequence and produce
specific, in situ gene correction10–12. This process is, in part,
dependent on the nucleotide excision repair and homology
dependent repair pathways10,13 [reviewed in ref. 12,14].
PNAs do not readily cross the cellular membrane15 and are
rapidly cleared within 10–30 min after intravenous or intraper-
itoneal administration16, thus, a delivery vehicle is needed to
achieve in vivo gene editing. We previously demonstrated that
PNA and donor DNA could be efficiently encapsulated in NPs
fabricated from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), a polymer
that has been approved by the FDA for numerous drug delivery
applications17. When compared to treatment with naked oligos,
PNA/DNA NP formulations led to thousands-fold higher gene
editing both in vitro and in vivo5,17.
In earlier work, we showed that genomic correction achieved
by PNA/DNA NPs leads to significant gene editing and pheno-
typic disease improvement in mouse models of β-thalassemia and
cystic fibrosis5–7. Unlike gene editing technologies that rely on the
activity of exogenously delivered nucleases18,19—such as zinc
finger nucleases, TAL effector nucleases, and CRISPR/Cas9—
PNA/DNA NPs can be readily administered in vivo and have
been shown to have extremely low to undetectable off-target
effects in the genome because the PNA editing molecules lack
inherent nuclease activity5–7.
Here, we sought to determine the feasibility, safety, and efficacy
of in utero gene editing mediated by PNA/DNA-containing NPs.
We find that NPs can be delivered to multiple fetal mouse tissues
intravenously, with the most pronounced accumulation in the fetal
liver, the site of fetal hematopoiesis. In contrast, intra-amniotic NP
delivery results in preferential NP accumulation in the fetal lung
and gut at gestational ages later than 15 days. We find that both
delivery approaches are minimally invasive and do not hinder fetal
development, long-term survival, or reproductive potential. Using
NPs loaded with next-generation, chemically modified γPNAs and
DNAs for in utero treatment, we corrected a disease-causing β-
thalassemia mutation in fetal mice to yield persistent postnatal
amelioration of disease as measured by elevation of hemoglobin
concentration, improved red blood cell morphology, decreased
reticulocyte counts, and reduction of extramedullary hematopoi-
esis, accompanied by a clinically relevant level of editing in both
fetal and adult bone marrow. Importantly, we observed a sub-
stantial long-term postnatal survival advantage for the in utero
treated animals versus untreated controls, highlighting the poten-
tial for clinical translation of our work.
Results
Biodistribution of nanoparticles in utero. Fetal surgeons and
maternal fetal medicine physicians can safely access the amniotic
cavity for amniocentesis and cannulate umbilical vessels for fetal
blood transfusions under ultrasound guidance as early as
18 weeks of gestation in humans20,21. These procedures have been
used in clinical practice since the 1980’s and carry a low risk of
fetal loss (~ 1%)20,22,23. We hypothesized that similar techniques
could be used to introduce NPs safely in utero. We tested this
hypothesis using PLGA NPs encapsulating fluorescent dyes. All
NPs used were spherical and similar in size (~200 nm) and zeta
potential (~ −25 mV) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Fluorescent NPs
were administered to fetal B6 mice either intravenously via the
vitelline vein, as a proxy for human umbilical vein transfusion, or
directly into the amniotic cavity at gestational ages later than E15
(Fig. 1a and Supplementary Movies 1, 2). Administration of NPs
to fetal mice results in particle retention within the fetuses with
no detectable particle accumulation in the maternal mouse
(Fig. 1b and Supplementary Figs. 2–4). As a positive control,
fluorescent NPs were directly administered to the maternal cir-
culation of a mouse pregnant with fetuses at E15.5, which results
in particle accumulation within the maternal liver (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3). Intra-vitelline vein delivery of fluorescent PLGA NPs
results in widespread particle distribution throughout the fetus at
both E15.5 and E16.5 with the most abundant NP accumulation
in the fetal liver (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 2), but no
accumulation in the liver of the mother. Substantial accumulation
of NPs in the fetal liver is expected during development because
the extraembryonic vitelline veins anastomose to form the portal
circulation.
During physiologic mammalian fetal development, the fetus
breaths amniotic fluid into and out of the developing lungs,
providing the necessary forces to direct lung development and
growth24. Developing fetuses also swallow amniotic fluid, which
aids the formation of the gastrointestinal tract25. Thus, introduc-
tion of NPs into the amniotic fluid at gestational ages after the
onset of fetal breathing and swallowing could result in their direct
delivery to the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, respectively.
Intra-amniotic (IA) injection of fluorescent NPs (Fig. 1a and
Supplementary Movie 3) at E15.5 did not lead to any detectable
particle
accumulation
within
the
fetus
(Fig.
1c,
d,
and
Supplementary Fig. 4). However, IA injection at E16.5—the
expected time of onset of pronounced fetal breathing and
swallowing26—resulted in particle accumulation in the fetal lung
and gut. NP accumulation in the lung and gut was also observed
after IA injections at E17.5 and E18.5, with increased intensity of
NP accumulation at the later gestational ages (Fig. 1c, d and
Supplementary Fig. 4).

 the Watson-Crick binding domain is extended longer than the
Hoogsteen domain for increased binding affinity and specifi-
city28,29. The PNAs are also substituted at the γ-backbone posi-
tion with a mini-polyethylene glycol (mini-PEG) side chain to
provide increased solubility and to enforce a helical pre-
organization that further enhances binding affinity for the DNA
target30. A γtcPNA/DNA pair developed to correct the β-
thalassemia-causing IVS2-654 mutation in the β-globin gene6 was
loaded into PLGA NPs. These NPs showed a spherical shape with
sizes and zeta potentials (Supplementary Fig. 5a) and nucleic acid
release profiles (Supplementary Fig. 5b) consistent with previous
formulations5–7. The tcPNAs used for this study were synthesized
with γ mini-PEG substitutions at alternating residues in the
Watson–Crick-binding domain6. We had previously shown that
PNAs containing alternating γPNAs induce gene editing at higher
frequencies than unmodified PNAs both ex vivo and in vivo6.
Partial modification with γ side chains is sufficient to pre-
organize the molecules into a helical conformation that markedly
increases DNA binding31.
Because this work represents the first attempt to carry out NP-
mediated gene editing in utero, we initially tested the safety of
injecting these PNA and DNA-containing NPs. We chose to
focus first on wild-type mice to assess the impact of the NPs on
growth and survival in the absence of disease. We found no
significant differences in the survival of pups to weaning
between those treated in utero with NPs, either intravenously
or intra-amniotically, compared to pups that received sham
surgery, but no in utero NP treatment, which we refer to as
untreated mice (Fig. 2a). For the mice that lived to weaning, we
observed no significant differences in the long-term survival
between untreated mice and those that received NP treatment in
utero (Fig. 2b). After pups were born and matured, we also
observed no significant differences between untreated mice and
those that received in utero NP treatment with respect to growth
patterns or body weights (Fig. 2c, d). No gross anatomical
deformities,
developmental
abnormalities,
or
tumors
were
observed in the mice that received in utero NP treatments
(n = 72). Mice that had been treated with NPs in utero were able
to have successful pregnancies and litters that were also free of
gross abnormalities and tumors (n = 14 litters, n = 99 pups). We
also measured fetal plasma cytokine levels 48 h after the IV
delivery of PBS, blank NPs, and PNA/DNA NPs. There were no
significant increases in levels of any of the proinflammatory
cytokines measured in the NP treated groups compared to
untreated fetuses (Fig. 2e), which is consistent with our previous
work in adult animals6. For reference, administration of a small
dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a positive control elicits a
response in which inflammatory cytokines are elevated over
200-fold6.
In utero gene correction leads to phenotypic improvement. As
in the human hematopoietic system32, murine hematopoietic
stem cells (HSCs), the target cells for gene correction in tha-
lassemia, first emerge in the para-aortic splanchnopleure after the
7th day of gestation, E7.5, and later in the aorto-gonad-mesone-
phros, umbilical and vitelline vessels on E10.533-35. HSCs that
develop in these tissues do not differentiate, but go on to seed the
fetal liver on E14.5, creating a niche that is capable of supporting
HSC self-renewal. Within the fetal liver, HSCs undergo a massive
expansion before further seeding the spleen, thymus, and finally

 the bone marrow at the beginning of E16.534,36. The rapid cycling
and expansion of HSCs in the fetal liver contrasts with adult bone
marrow HSCs, which are largely quiescent37. Because our prior
work identified increased DNA repair and gene editing in acti-
vated stem cells5,6, we hypothesized that the ability to target this
rapidly dividing and expanding stem cell population in the fetal
liver might represent an important therapeutic opportunity for
gene editing.
Given our observation that NPs injected in the vitelline vein on
day E15.5 accumulate in the fetal liver during this time of rapid
HSC expansion, we chose that time and administration route to test
the in utero gene editing potential of PNA/DNA NPs in a
transgenic mouse model of β-thalassemia. In this model, the two
(cis) murine β-globin genes are replaced with a single copy of the
human β-globin gene containing a β-thalassemia-associated splice
site mutation in intron 2 at position 654. No homozygous Hbbth-4/
Hbbth-4 mice survive postnatally. Heterozygous Hbbth-4/Hbb+
mice produce reduced amounts of mouse β-globin chains and no
human β-globin, resulting in β-thalassemia marked by microcytic
anemia and splenomegaly38.
To test if in utero γPNA/DNA delivery could lead to gene editing
and postnatal disease improvement, NPs (300 or 400 mg kg−1 per
fetus based on an average E15.5 fetal weight of 0.45 g) were
administered intravenously to each fetus via the vitelline vein at
E15.5. The resulting pups were genotyped prior to weaning. The
blood hemoglobin concentrations of treated heterozygous mice
were measured at six and ten weeks of age. At both doses, fetuses
that were treated with NPs developed into adult mice with
significantly
higher
levels
of
hemoglobin
than
untreated
β-thalassemic mice. Notably, the higher dose of γPNA/DNA NPs
resulted in a greater elevation of hemoglobin concentrations,
yielding values in the wild-type range at both six and ten weeks of
age (Fig. 3a). The sustained elevation in postnatal hemoglobin was
accompanied by a clear improvement in red blood cell (RBC)
morphology on peripheral blood smear (Fig. 3b). In contrast, the
peripheral
smears
of
untreated
mice
continued
to
display
anisocytosis, poiklocytosis, and an abundance of target cells, all of
which are hallmarks of β-thalassemia (Fig. 3b).
Hbbth-4/Hbb+ mice have dramatically enlarged spleens, which
is consistent with the splenomegaly due to extramedullary
hematopoiesis seen in patients with thalassemia38. In utero NP
administration produced a 73% reduction in splenic weight in
treated mice, compared to controls, measured in adult animals
over 15 weeks after the in utero NP treatment (Fig. 3c). The
observed reduction in splenomegaly correlated with improved
splenic architecture in treated mice, with prominently defined red

 and white pulp, similar to that normally seen in wild-type
(Fig. 3b). The normal demarcations between the white pulp and
surrounding red pulp are blurred in the untreated Hbbth-4/Hbb+
mice (since extramedullary hematopoiesis leads to expansion of
the red pulp and disruption of the white pulp). Decreased
immunostaining for CD44 (stains erythroid precursors and
staining decreases during terminal erythroid differentiation, but
is not specific39,40), CD71 (specifically stains early erythro-
blasts39,41), E-cadherin (immature erythroid precursors42) and
CD61 (megakaryocytes) in treated compared to untreated mice
additionally suggests a reduction in extramedullary hematopoiesis
(Supplementary Figs. 6, 7). Taken together, the reduction of
splenomegaly and improvement in splenic histology pattern in
treated mice further indicates alleviation of anemia. In addition to
elevated hemoglobin levels, improved RBC morphology, and
reduction of splenomegaly, we also found significantly reduced
reticulocyte counts in the peripheral blood of treated mice
(Fig. 4a, b), again indicating substantial correction of anemia.
Importantly, the mice treated with NPs in utero also showed a
significant postnatal survival advantage compared to untreated
controls. At 500 days after birth, in utero treated mice had 100%
survival, in contrast to just 69% survival in the untreated group
(Fig. 4c).
Confirmation of in utero gene correction at the DNA level. To
quantify the extent of gene editing achieved in the mice that leads
to these observed postnatal improvements in anemia, we per-
formed deep sequencing analysis on genomic DNA extracted
from total bone marrow of postnatal mice at a 15 week time-point
counting from the day of the in utero NP treatment. Correction of
the targeted mutation was detected at a frequency of ~6% in the
total bone marrow (Table 1). Deep sequencing was also used to
assess off-target effects in the bone marrow by evaluating seven
other genomic sites with partial homology to the binding site of
the γPNA6. The results revealed an undetectable mutation fre-
quency at these off-target sites in the bone marrow of treated
mice (Table 1). The total measured off-target frequency com-
bining all sites is <0.000002%.

 analysis of β-globin gene editing by deep sequencing. In these
cells, we observed 8.81% editing by deep sequencing (Table 2). It
is likely that the sustained correction of anemia and persistence of
gene editing into the adulthood of treated mice is explained by the
prevalence of a population of fetal HSCs that were successfully
edited by the single dose of γtcPNA/DNA loaded NPs.
As another method of quantification of editing efficiency, we
developed and validated a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay
(Supplementary Fig. 9) and used it to quantify the percentage of
modified β-globin gene alleles in total bone marrow as well as an
isolated population of lineage depleted hematopoietic progenitor
cells (HPCs) in Hbbth-4/Hbb+ mice 15 weeks after in utero
γtcPNA/DNA NP treatment. In the total bone marrow cells,
ddPCR analysis confirmed an average of ~6% editing, which is
consistent with the deep sequencing data, whereas ~10% gene
correction was measured in isolated HPCs (Fig. 4d and
Supplementary Fig. 10).
Discussion
Genetic correction during pregnancy could provide treatment or
cure of genetic diseases and allow normal fetal development, a
possible advantage compared to treatments given after birth.
Monogenic diseases that pose the risk of serious fetal, neonatal,
and pediatric morbidity or mortality, such as β-thalassemia, are
particularly attractive targets for in utero gene editing [reviewed
in43]. β-thalassemia and other hemoglobinopathies are relatively
common, manifest early in life, and can be cured by low levels of
functional protein activity. By delivering gene-editing therapies in
utero, it is possible to gain access to dividing stem and progenitor
cell populations, which can result in propagation of the corrected
gene in all progeny cells.
Here we demonstrate that in utero delivery of PLGA nano-
particles loaded with PNA/DNA is a safe and effective means of
achieving clinically relevant frequencies of site-specific, non-
enzymatic gene editing in a mammalian fetus that results in
sustained postnatal alleviation of disease. A single in utero dose of
γPNA/DNA NPs given on E15.5 mediated a level of gene editing
sufficient to ameliorate the disease phenotype postnatally. We
observed increased hemoglobin concentrations into the wild-type
range, improved red cell morphology, reduced reticulocyte
counts, and decreased extramedullary hematopoiesis. In addition,
we found that in utero gene editing conferred a significant sur-
vival advantage on the treated mice compared to untreated
controls. These findings suggest that in utero gene editing has the
potential to be safe and produce a clinical response substantial

 We examined the biodistribution of nanoparticles after in utero
administration and found that the highest accumulation of par-
ticles three hours after intravenous administration was within the
fetal liver. We also found that intra-amniotic administration
results in nanoparticle distribution to the fetal lung and gut at
gestational ages later than E15.5. Although not used for gene
editing in this study, intra-amniotic delivery of nanoparticles may
allow for in utero genetic correction of diseases that affect the
lung or gut such as cystic fibrosis. Biodistribution at three
hours after administration was selected for this study because,
based on in vitro measurements, the nanoparticle formulation
used for gene editing releases the majority of its nucleic acid
contents within this time frame. The distribution of particles at
later time-points merits further study and may reveal that the
tissue distribution shifts over time, which could open the possi-
bility of editing other developing tissues of interest, such as the
fetal brain, which might require particles with longer release
profiles. In this regard, altering the polymer composition, size, or
surface modifications could also be investigated as means of
changing the distribution or nucleic acid release profile of
nanoparticles, as we have shown in other studies44–47.
Here we chose to use a γPNA and donor DNA pair previously
shown to be effective at achieving gene editing and clinical disease
improvement in adult mice with β-thalassemia6. We elected to
deliver these molecules using PLGA, a biodegradable and bio-
compatible polymer that is known to be safe in humans. In prior
work, clinically relevant levels of gene editing were achieved in
adult mice after multiple doses of nanoparticles were adminis-
tered in combination with stem cell factor (SCF). The use of SCF,
the CD117 receptor ligand, was shown to increase the percentage
of CD117+ hematopoietic progenitor cells in S-phase, elevate
DNA repair gene expression, and significantly boost the gene
editing frequency6. During fetal development, however, it is well
known that SCF is highly expressed at sites of hematopoiesis,
including the yolk sac, fetal liver, and bone marrow48–50. High
levels of SCF within the fetal liver may create an environment that
is particularly amenable to gene editing using our approach. Of
note, an editing frequency of ~4% was achieved in total bone
marrow cells and 7% in HSCs in adult mice after four doses of
nanoparticles and SCF, compared to ~6% editing in total bone
marrow and ~10% in progenitor cells after a single in utero
injection containing a fraction of the particles used postnatally [at
relative total doses of 185 μg NPs (in utero) versus 8 mg NPs
(adult)]. These improvements suggest there may be an advantage
to gene editing in the fetus because it is possible to access a
rapidly cycling population of HSCs within in the fetal liver.
Unlike other gene editing technologies that rely on activity of
exogenous nucleases (CRISPR/Cas, TAL effector nucleases and
zinc finger nucleases) that can create extraneous double-stranded
breaks, PNA-mediated gene editing makes use of endogenous,
high fidelity repair pathways, which reduces the risk of error-
prone end-joining causing additional mutations. With continuing
concern regarding off-target effects of CRISPR/Cas951 and the
finding that Cas9 proteins can illicit an adaptive immune
response52, the safety profile of PNA/DNA editing may be par-
ticularly attractive, as avoiding off-target mutations is of excep-
tional importance during fetal development.
We found that a single treatment of γPNA/DNA nanoparticles
resulted in a gene editing frequency of ~6% in total bone marrow
cells (and 8.8% in E18.5 Lin-, Sca1+, cKit+ HSCs and 10% is adult
HPCs). The fact that gene editing at these frequencies could yield
a discernable phenotypic improvement is consistent with trans-
plantation studies in thalassemic mice and humans, in which low
numbers of engrafted donor cells are sufficient to correct ane-
mia53–55. This finding is attributed to a positive in vivo selection
of genetically corrected erythroblasts56. For instance, the average
red cell half-life is reduced by 50% in humans with β-thalassemia
compared to the red cell half-life in average adults57,58. Similarly,
others have observed a selective advantage of corrected hemato-
poietic progenitor cells in patients with severe combined immu-
nodeficiency (SCID)-X1 disease who received viral-mediated gene
therapy59–61.
The relatively short gestation of mice limited us to delivering
just one treatment of nanoparticles. Due to the low toxicity of one
dose, we speculate that multiple treatments should be possible in
humans or mammals with longer gestational periods, which may
result in higher gene editing frequencies. For instance, during
human fetal development the liver is the main site of hemato-
poiesis and HSC cycling from about 6 to 22 weeks of gestation62,
which could allow for weeks of access to the fetal liver HSCs via
umbilical vessel cannulation. Treatment at later time points, when
the HSCs primarily reside within the fetal BM, could also be
therapeutic since the HSCs are still rapidly cycling [reviewed
in63]. Additionally, PNA-modifications that enhance target
binding such as guanidine-G-clamp PNA monomers64, could be
used to further improve gene-editing efficiencies.
In utero gene editing may hold great promise for treating or
curing numerous inherited human genetic diseases. While the
work presented here provides a foundation for a clinically
translatable approach for site-specific gene editing in utero
mediated by γPNA/DNA nanoparticles, further study is war-
ranted to determine the efficacy and safety of this technique in

 other disease models, including large animals such as sheep and
non-human primates. Success in future investigations could
provide a compelling rationale for clinical application.
Methods
Experimental design. The main goal of our study was to determine if nano-
particles loaded with PNA and donor DNA could be used alleviate signs of anemia
after a single-dose in utero administration in a mouse model of human
β-thalassemia. The sample sizes of experiments were selected on the basis of
previous experience. Data collection was stopped at a priori defined points for all
experiments. For all in utero treatment experiments, animals were randomly
assigned to IV, IA, or control treatment groups in a blinded manner. For
β-thalassemia mouse experiments, end points were selected based on relevant
clinical manifestation of disease in the mouse model. All sample measurements
were blinded. For the β-thalassemia survival experiment, age-matched untreated
mice were randomly assigned at weaning. The number of replicates for each
experiment is stated in each figure legend.
Oligonucleotides. Mini-PEG γPNA monomers were prepared from Boc-
(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl)-L-serine as a starting material by a series of multistep
synthetic procedures including reduction, mitsunobu reaction, nucleobase (A, C, G
and T) conjugation and then ester cleavage31. At each step, the respective product
was purified by column chromatography30. PNA oligomers were synthesized on
solid support using Boc chemistry31. The oligomers were synthesized on MBHA
(4-methylbenzhydrylamine) resin according to standard procedures of Boc
chemistry. A kaiser test was performed at each step to measure complete coupling
and double coupling was performed if it was required. The oligomers were cleaved
from the resin using an m-cresol/thioanisole/TFMSA/TFA (1:1:2:6) cocktail, and
the resulting mixtures were precipitated with ethyl ether, purified by reversed-
phase high-performance liquid chromatography (acetonitrile:water) and char-
acterized with a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometer6. The sequence of γPNA used in this study is H-KKK-JTTTJTTT
JTJT-OOO-TCTCTTTCTTTCAGGGCA-KKK-NH2. Underlined bases indicate
γPNA residues; K, lysine; J, pseudoisocytosine; O, 8-amino-2,6,10-trioxaoctanoic
acid linkers connecting the Hoogsteen and Watson–Crick domains of the tcPNA.
The single-stranded donor DNA oligomer was prepared by standard DNA
synthesis except for the inclusion of three phosphorothioate internucleoside
linkages at each end to protect against nuclease degradation (Midland Certified
Reagent Company; Midland, TX). The 60 bp donor DNA matches positions
624–684 in β-globin intron 2, with the correcting IVS2-654 nucleotide underlined:
5′-AAAGAATAACAGTGATAATTTCTGGGTTAAGGCAATAGCAATATC
TCTGCATATAAATAT-3′.
PLGA nanoparticle synthesis and characterization. PLGA (50:50 ester-termi-
nated, 0.55–0.75 g dl−1, LACTEL absorbable polymers; Birmingham, AL) NPs
containing C6 (Sigma; St Louis, MO) or DiD (Thermo Scientific; Rockford, IL)
were synthesized using a single-emulsion solvent evaporation technique17. C6 or
DiD was added to the polymer solution at a 0.2% wt:wt dye:polymer ratio. PNA/
DNA and blank PLGA NPs were synthesized using a double-emulsion solvent
evaporation technique modified to encapsulate PNA and DNA oligomers6,65.
PNAs and donor DNAs were dissolved in 60.8 μl DNAse-free water. All nano-
particle batches had 2 nmole mg−1 of γPNA and 1 nmole mg−1 of donor DNA.
The encapsulant was added dropwise to a polymer solution containing 80 mg 50:50
ester-terminated PLGA dissolved in dichloromethane (800 μl), then ultrasonicated
(3 × 10 s) to formulate the first emulsion. To form the second emulsion, the first
emulsion was added slowly dropwise to 1.6 ml of 5% aqueous polyvinyl alcohol and
then ultrasonicated (3 × 10 s). This mixture was finally poured into 20 ml of 0.3%
aqueous polyvinyl alcohol and stirred for 3 h at room temperature. Nanoparticles
were then thoroughly washed with 20 ml water (3×) and further collected each time
by centrifugation (25,644 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Nanoparticles were resuspended
in water, frozen at −80 °C, and then lyophilized. Nanoparticles were stored at −20
°C after lyophilization6. Blank NPs were loaded with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline
and formulated using the double emulsion method described above. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using an XL-30 scanning electron
microscope (FEI; Hillsboro, Oregon) as previously described17. Dynamic light
scattering (DLS) was performed to measure the NPs size (hydrodynamic diameter)
and surface charge (zeta potential) using a Malvern Nano-ZS (Malvern Instru-
ments, UK). Nucleic acid release was analyzed by incubating particles (2 mg) in
600 μl 1× phosphate-buffered saline in a 37 °C shaker, spinning down and
removing supernatant. The nucleic acid content of the supernatant was measured
as the absorbance at 260 nm at the indicated time points.
Mouse models and genotyping. All animal use was in accordance with the
guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Yale University and
conformed to the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Research
Council, National Academy of Sciences, 1996). Animal protocols were approved by
the IACUC of Yale University. C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River
Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). The IVS2-654 β-thalassemia mice were obtained
from Ryszard Kole, University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill, NC)38. Litters from
this mouse model were genotyped prior to weaning. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was
isolated from tail clippings using the Wizard SV DNA Purification System (Pro-
mega; Madison, WI). Genotyping PCR was performed to detect the presence of the
human β-globin gene, indicating the mouse has a Hbbth-4/Hbb+ genotype, using a
species independent forward primer (complementary to both mouse and human
β-globin sequences) and two species dependent reverse primers. Genotyping
primers are as follows: forward—5′-CCCTGGGCAGGTTGGTATC-3′; human
reverse—5′-AACGATCCTGAGACTTCCACA-3′; and mouse reverse
5′–AGCAGAGGCAGAGGATAGGTC–3′. PCR was performed using high fidelity
Platinum TAQ polymerase (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA); reaction conditions are as
follows: 5.0 μl 10 × HiFi buffer, 3.0 μl MgCl2, 1.0 μl dNTPs, 2.0 μl 10 μM forward
primer, 1.0 μl 10 μM human reverse primer, 1.0 μl 10 μM mouse reverse primer,
0.8 μl HiFi Taq, 90–400 ng gDNA and remaining volume to 50 μl with dH2O.
Thermocycler conditions were as follows: 94 °C 2 min, [94 °C 30 s, 55 °C 45 s, 68 °C
1 min] × 35 cycles, 68 °C 1 min, hold at 4 °C. PCR products were run on a 2%
agarose gel. The amplicon derived from the mouse reverse primer is 196 bp and the
amplicon from the human reverse primer is 508 bp. The presence of bands at both
196 and 508 bp indicates the Hbbth-4/Hbb+ genotype. A single band at 196 bp
indicates the Hbb+/Hbb+ genotype. Only heterozygous mice were included in this
study.
In utero NP delivery and imaging. Time dated pregnant mice (8–12 weeks old)
between 15–18 days post conception were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane (3%
vol/vol for induction, 2% vol/vol for maintenance). The gravid uterus was exposed
through a midline laparotomy incision. For the biodistribution studies, lyophilized
fluorescent nanoparticles were resuspended by vortex and water bath sonication in
1× dPBS to a concentration of 9 mg ml−1. Intravascular injections were performed
at E15.5 and E16.5. A volume of 15 μl of 9 mg ml−1 NP suspension was drawn up
into a glass micropipette (tip diameter ~60 μm) and injected intravascularly via
vitelline vein of each fetus using a pneumatic microinjector (Narishige; Japan).
Intra-amniotic injections were performed at E15.5, E16.5, E17.5 and E18.5. A
volume of 20 μl of 9 mg ml−1 NP suspension was injected directly into the amniotic
cavity of each fetus. As a positive control to detect NPs in maternal circulation, 100
μl of 9 mg ml−1 C6 NPs were injected intravenously into a mouse pregnant with
fetuses at E15.5. Pregnant mice were killed 3 h post DiD PLGA NP injection and
fluorescence and x-ray imaging was performed on a Carestream In-Vivo MS FX
PRO (Bruker; Billerica, MA). Pregnant mice were also killed 3 h post C6 PLGA NP
injection. Fetuses were delivered via cesarean section and washed in PBS. Ex vivo
fetal fluorescence stereomicrope imaging was performed on a Leica
M80 stereomicroscope (Wetzlar, Germany). Fetuses and maternal organs were
fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences; Hartfield,
PA) at 4 °C. The tissues were next dehydrated in 20% sucrose and embedded in
Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) Compound (Torrance, CA). Frozen 15 μm-
thick fetal and maternal liver sections were mounted on glass slides and stained
with Hoescht dye. Confocal imaging of the frozen sections was performed on a
Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Oberkochen, Germany).
For the safety studies, the fetuses of time dated pregnant C57BL/6 females
(8–10 weeks old) were injected intravenously at E15.5 as described above with 15 μl
of 9 mg ml−1 PNA/DNA NPs. Intra-amniotic injections were performed at E16.5;
20 μl of 9 mg ml−1 blank NPs or PNA/DNA NPs were injected into the amniotic
cavity. Untreated pregnant mice were anesthetized and the gravid uterus was
exposed as described above. The fetuses were counted, the uterus was returned to
the abdomen, and the midline incision was closed. The number of untreated,
intravenously and intra-amniotically treated pups surviving was counted at the
time of weaning, 21 days. The weight of injected and untreated control pups was
measured for a period of 10 months.
The fetuses of time dated pregnant Hbbth-4/Hbb+ mice (mated with Hbbth-4/
Hbb+ males) were injected intravenously as described above with 15 μl of either 9
mg ml−1 or 12 mg ml−1 PNA/DNA NPs, correlating to doses of 300 mg kg−1 or
400 mg kg−1, respectively.
Cytokine array analysis. The fetuses of time dated pregnant C57BL/6 females
(8–10 weeks old) were injected intravenously at E15.5 as described above with 15 μl

 of blank NPs (9 mg ml−1), PNA/DNA NPs (9 mg ml−1), or 1× dPBS. After 48 h,
fetal plasma samples were collected. Plasma samples from fetuses receiving PBS,
blank NPs, or PNA/DNA NPs and untreated fetuses were submitted to the
CytoPlex Core Facility at Yale University. The facility performed luminex based
cytokine detection and quantification using the Bio-Plex Pro Mouse Cytokine 23-
Plex assay available from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA).
Peripheral blood analysis. Mice were anesthetized using open-drop 30% w/v
isoflurane in propylene glycol. A volume of 50–100 μl of blood was collected retro-
orbitally using heparinized micro-hematocrit capillary tubes (Fisher Scientific;
Pittsburgh, PA) and evacuated into heparinized coated tubes containing 5 μl 0.5 M
EDTA acid. Complete blood counts were performed using a Hemavet 950FS (Drew
Scientific; Oxford, CT) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A volume of 1–3
μl of fresh blood was smeared onto glass slides and stained with Wright–Giemsa
stain (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) for 20 s. Slides were washed in 1× dPBS for
10 min and air-dried. An additional 10 μl of blood was incubated with 3 μl new
methlylene blue reticulocyte stain (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) for 10 min after
which blood smears were prepared. A cover slip was mounted on air-dried smears
with Cytoseal 60 (Thermo Scientific; Rockford, IL). All blood smears were imaged
on an Olympus FSX100 microscope. Two individuals independently counted the
number of reticulocytes present in 500 cells. The relative reticulocyte count was
calculated as the number reticulocytes in 1000 RBCs divided by ten.
Histology. Spleen images were taken and weights were recorded for Hbbth-4/Hbb+
mice 15–30 weeks post PNA/DNA NP delivery, age-matched untreated Hbbth-4/
Hbb+ mice, and wild-type mice. The collected spleens were fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin and processed by Yale Pathology Tissue Services for H&E
staining as well as E-cadherin, CD44, CD71 and CD61 immunohistochemistry. All
antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1000. Spleen sections were imaged on an
Olympus FSX100 microscope.
Fetal bone marrow collection and cell sorting. The bone marrow of untreated
and PNA/DNA NP treated Hbbth-4/Hbb+ mice were collected 3 days post NP
delivery on E18.5 as previously reported36. Freshly isolated fetal bone marrow cells
were suspended in ice-cold DMEM + (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 10
mM HEPES, 2% fetal bovine serum [FBS]) at 107 cells ml−1 and stained for 15 min
on ice with anti-cKit-PE (eBioscience, Cat #12-1171-82), anti-Sca1-(PerCP)-Cy5.5
(eBioscience, Cat #45-5981-82), and FITC-conjugated lineage marker antibodies
[CD4 (eBioscience, Cat #11-0041-82), CD8 (eBioscience, Cat #11-0081-82), Ter119
(eBioscience, Cat #11-5921-82), Gr-1 (eBioscience, Cat #11-5931-82), and CD45
(eBioscience, Cat #11-0452-82)] (Thermo Scientific; Rockford, IL). All antibodies
were used at a dilution of 1:100. Samples were then washed with 10 × volume of
HBSS + (Hank’s balanced salt solution, 10 mM HEPES, 2% FBS) and centrifuged at
0.4 × g for 8 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in DMEM + and samples
were immediately sorted by flow cytometry (BD FACSAria).
Deep sequencing analysis. Genomic DNA (gDNA) from the bone marrow of
adult PNA/DNA NP treated Hbbth-4/Hbb+ mice and age-matched untreated
Hbbth-4/Hbb+ mice was collected using the Wizard SV DNA Purification System
(Promega, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer’s instructions. gDNA was
collected from sorted fetal bone marrow cells using a phenol-chloroform extraction
method. Cells were digested overnight in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl,
20 mM ethylenediamine tetracetic acid and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, with pro-
teinase K. Digests were subjected to extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl
alcohol followed by re-extraction with choloroform, precipitated with KOAc in
EtOH, spun down and dried at room temperature and resuspended in dH2O. PCR
reactions were performed with high fidelity TAQ polymerase (Invitrogen; Carlsbad,
CA). Each PCR tube consisted of 28.2 µL dH2O, 5 µL 10 × HiFi Buffer, 3 µL 50 mM
MgCl2, 1 µL DNTP, 1 µL each of forward and reverse primer, 0.8 µL High Fidelity
Platinum Taq Polymerase and 10 µL 40 ng/ml gDNA. Thermocycler conditions
were as follows: 94 °C 2 min (94 °C 30 s, 55 °C 45 s, 68 °C 1 min) x35 cycles, 68 °C 1
min, hold at 4 °C. PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Pur-
ification Kit (Qiagen; Hilden, Germany). PCR products were prepared by end-
repair and adapter ligation according to Illumina protocols (San Diego, CA), and
samples were sequenced by the Illumina HiSeq 2500 with 75 paired-end reads at
the Yale Center for Genome Analysis. Samples were analyzed as previously
described5. Briefly, paired-end reads were merged using PEAR (v. 0.9.6)66. The
merged reads were mapped to the loci of interest using BWA-MEM aligner
(v. 0.7.12)67. The nucleotide composition for each position in the alignment was
obtained with in-house python scripts. To study off-target effects, we looked for the
presence of 16 bp k-mers of the donor sequence in the off-target sequencing
libraries allowing for one mismatch using BBTools. The primers used for β−globin
intron 2 were as follows:6 forward primer: 5′-TATCATGCCTCTTTGCACCA-3′;
reverse primer: 5′-AGCAATATGAAACCTCTTACATCA-3′. Primers for off-
target sites of partial homology were as follows;6 forward primer is listed first:

Droplet digital PCR quantification of editing in bone marrow cells and HPCs.
Bone marrow was collected from the femurs of Hbbth-4/Hbb+ mice 15 weeks after
NP treatment and age-matched untreated Hbbth-4/Hbb+ mice. Hematopoietic
progenitor cells (CD3e-, CD11b−, CD19−, CD45R−, Gr-1-, Ter119−) were isolated
by magnetic separation using an EasySepTM Mouse Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell
Isolation Kit (STEMCELLTM Technologies, Vancouver, CA) according to manu-
facturer’s instructions. gDNA was extracted from total bone marrow cells or
isolated progenitor populations using the Wizard SV DNA Purification System
(Promega, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The con-
centration of extracted gDNA samples was measured using a QuBit® dsDNA BR
assay kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Up
to 80 ng of gDNA was used for each sample per reaction. PCR reactions were set up
as followed: 11 μl 2 × ddPCR™ supermix for probes (no dUTP) (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA), 0.2 μl forward primer (100 μM), 0.2 μl reverse primer (100 μM), 0.053 μl β-
thal probe (100 μM), 0.053 μl wild-type probe (100 μM) (Integrated DNA Tech-
nologies, Coralville, IA), 0.5 μl EcoR1, 10 μl gDNA and dH2O. Droplets were
generated using the Automated Droplet Generator (AutoDG™) (Bio-Rad). Ther-
mocycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C 10 min, (94 °C 30 s, 55.3 °C 1 min –
ramp 2 °C/s) x 40 cycles, 98 °C 10 min, hold at 4 °C. Droplets were allowed to rest
at 4 °C for at least 30 min after cycling and were then read using the QX200™
Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad). Data were analyzed using QuantaSoft™ software. Data
are represented as the fractional abundance of the wild-type allele. The primers
used for ddPCR were as follows: forward: 5′-ACCATTCTAAAGAATAA
CAGTGA-3′, reverse: 5′-CCTCTTACATCAGTTACAATTT-3′. The probes used
for ddPCR were as follows: wild-type (FAM): 5′-TGGGTTAAGGCAATAGCA
A-3′, β-thal (HEX): 5′-TCTGGGTTAAGGTAATAGCAAT-3′.
Statistical analysis. The data are means ± s.e.m. unless otherwise noted and
compared using one-way or two-way ANOVA with repeated measures when
appropriate. Bonferroni correction was used to correct for multiple comparisons.
Survival data were analyzed using a Log-rank test. Statistical analyses were carried
out using GraphPad Prism. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Data availability. Additional data and movies are available in the supplementary
material. Deep sequencing data has been deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read
Archive under accession number SRP142526.
