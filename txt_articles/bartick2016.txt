Abstract
The aim of this study was to quantify the excess cases of pediatric and maternal disease, death,
and costs attributable to suboptimal breastfeeding rates in the United States. Using the current
literature on the associations between breastfeeding and health outcomes for nine pediatric
and five maternal diseases, we created Monte Carlo simulations modeling a hypothetical cohort
of U.S. women followed from age 15 to age 70 years and their children from birth to age 20 years.
We examined disease outcomes using (a) 2012 breastfeeding rates and (b) assuming that 90% of
infants were breastfed according to medical recommendations. We measured annual excess
cases, deaths, and associated costs, in 2014 dollars, using a 2% discount rate. Annual excess
deaths attributable to suboptimal breastfeeding total 3,340 (95% confidence interval [1,886 to
4,785]), 78% of which are maternal due to myocardial infarction (n = 986), breast cancer
(n = 838), and diabetes (n = 473). Excess pediatric deaths total 721, mostly due to Sudden Infant
Death Syndrome (n = 492) and necrotizing enterocolitis (n = 190). Medical costs total $3.0 billion,
79% of which are maternal. Costs of premature death total $14.2 billion. The number of women
needed to breastfeed as medically recommended to prevent an infant gastrointestinal infection is
0.8; acute otitis media, 3; hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infection, 95; maternal hyper-
tension, 55; diabetes, 162; and myocardial infarction, 235. For every 597 women who optimally
breastfeed, one maternal or child death is prevented. Policies to increase optimal breastfeeding
could result in substantial public health gains. Breastfeeding has a larger impact on women's
health than previously appreciated.

BACKGROUND
With the rising costs of health care, there is great need for health
interventions that are cost‐effective. Current U.S. rates of any and
exclusive breastfeeding (Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion, 2015) are suboptimal compared with medical recommenda-
tions that mothers and infants exclusively breastfeed for the first
6 months of life, with continued breastfeeding for at least 1 year
(American Academy of Pediatrics and Section on Breastfeeding,
2012; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Com-
mittee on Obstetric Practice, 2016). Suboptimal breastfeeding is
defined as breastfeeding that falls short of these medical recom-
mendations. The United States ranks 26 of 29 countries in infant
mortality in countries in the Organisation of Economic Co‐operation

 and Development database (MacDorman, Matthews, Mohangoo, &
Zeitlin, 2014) and ranks 33 of 179 world countries on mothers'
and children's well‐being (Save the Children, 2015). After the
pioneering U.S. cost analysis done by Weimer, from which our orig-
inal work was based (Weimer, 2001), other cost analyses from
Australia (Smith, Thompson, & Ellwood, 2002), the Netherlands
(Büchner, Hoekstra, & van Rossum, 2007), the UK (Renfrew et al.,
2012), and more globally (Rollins et al., 2016) have followed. Our
2010
analysis
of
pediatric
costs
found
that
suboptimal
breastfeeding was associated with $2.2 billion in direct medical
costs, $1.2 billion in indirect costs, and 911 premature child deaths,
incurring societal costs of $9.6 billion in 2007 U.S. dollars (Bartick
& Reinhold, 2010). Our 2013 analysis of maternal costs found that
suboptimal breastfeeding was associated with $734 million in direct
medical costs, $126 million in indirect costs, and $17.4 billion (2011
U.S. dollars), in societal costs of 4,396 premature deaths (Bartick
et al., 2013). However, these two models were structured differ-
ently, precluding a comprehensive assessment of the impact of
suboptimal breastfeeding on maternal and child health. To estimate
the total impact of excess disease and health costs in the United
States associated with suboptimal breastfeeding, we constructed a
Monte Carlo simulation model that included both maternal and
pediatric health outcomes.

METHODS
We modeled the disease outcomes and associated costs for the cohort
of U.S. women who were 15 years old in 2002 and the children they
bear over their lifetimes, using 2012 population fertility rates (Martin,
Hamilton, Osterman, Curtin, & Matthews, 2013). We modeled the
cohort under two different breastfeeding scenarios: (a) the 2012
breastfeeding rates (“the suboptimal” arm) and (b) an optimal
breastfeeding rate (the “optimal” arm), defined as 90% of infants
breastfed according to medical recommendations (American Academy
of Pediatrics & Section on Breastfeeding, 2012; American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Obstetric Practice,
2016). Disease outcomes were modeled using a Monte Carlo simula-
tion, and costs were modeled using cost accounting techniques. In
contrast to our earlier models, this approach allows evaluation of the
potential impact of policy and societal changes that would enable a
cohort of women to achieve optimal breastfeeding throughout their
childbearing years.
We modeled the health outcomes of a cohort of women born in a
single year (2002) followed over their lifetime from age 15 to 70 years,
and their children's health outcomes from birth to age 20 years, in
order to capture women whose peak childbearing age (Martin et al.,
2013) would be captured by the 2012 breastfeeding data. Based on
a review of the literature, we selected diseases for our model that (a)
have the most robust evidence base demonstrating an association with
breastfeeding and (b) apply to the U.S. population (Table 1; AAP Sec-
tion on Breastfeeding, 2012; Hörnell, Lagstrom, Lande, & Thorsdottir,
2013; Horta, Bahl, Martinex, & Victora, 2007; Horta & Victora, 2013;
Ip et al., 2007).

Pediatric disease
We included nine pediatric diseases: acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL; Amitay & Keinan‐Boker, 2015), acute otitis media (AOM; Ip
et al., 2007), Crohn's disease (Hörnell et al., 2013; Klement, Cohen,
Boxman, Joseph, & Reif, 2004; Wolters et al., 2006), ulcerative colitis
(Hörnell et al., 2013; Klement et al., 2004), gastrointestinal infection
(GII; Duijts, Jaddoe, Hofman, & Moll, 2010), lower respiratory tract
infection (LRTI) requiring hospitalization (Ip et al., 2007; Murphy,
Kochanek, Xu, & Heron, 2015), obesity (Grummer‐Strawn & Mei,
2004), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC; Murphy et al., 2015), and Sud-
den Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS; Hauck, Thompson, Tanabe, Moon,
& Vennemann, 2011; Murphy et al., 2015). Literature linking infant
feeding patterns with childhood obesity is mixed. To model obesity,
we selected the study most directly applicable to U.S. infants, which
found an association at age 4 years limited to non‐Hispanic white chil-
dren (Grummer‐Strawn & Mei, 2004). Other data suggest that the
association between breastfeeding and obesity is most pronounced
among non‐Hispanic white preschool children (Weng, Redsell, Swift,
Yang, & Glazebrook, 2012). Based on these data, our model included
a breastfeeding‐associated reduction in obesity among non‐Hispanic
white children only. We chose this approach to err on the side of
underestimating, rather than overestimating, the costs associated with
suboptimal breastfeeding.
In contrast to our previous analysis, we excluded type 1 diabetes,
because a recent pooled analysis demonstrated only a weak associa-
tion with infant feeding (Cardwell et al., 2012). We excluded asthma
and atopic dermatitis because recent research does not support a
strong protective association in high‐income countries (Flohr et al.,
Key messages
• This is the first comprehensive analysis of the health and economic burdens of suboptimal breastfeeding rates in the industrialized
world, using Monte Carlo simulation models to include maternal and pediatric disease in a single study.
• Suboptimal breastfeeding has a substantial impact on both maternal and pediatric health outcomes and costs.
• Nearly 80% of the excess deaths and medical costs attributable to suboptimal breastfeeding are maternal.
• Breastfeeding is a women's health issue, and advocates for women's health should play an integral role in enabling families to achieve
optimal breastfeeding.

 2011; Nagel et al., 2009). We excluded acute myeloid leukemia
because a 2015 meta‐analysis showed an association only for ALL
(Amitay & Keinan‐Boker, 2015). We included Crohn's disease and
ulcerative colitis because recent data
show an association of
breastfeeding and inflammatory bowel disease (Hörnell et al., 2013;
Klement et al., 2004).
To model the effect of breastfeeding on risk of NEC, we used
previously unpublished data from the multicenter Glutamine Trial in
an analysis performed especially for this study (Colaizy et al., 2016),
because of need for more current data than the literature provided.
In our model, preterm infants could be fed by mothers' own milk
with bovine fortifier, preterm formula, or a mixed diet of mothers'
own milk and preterm formula (see eTables 1 and 2 Appendix in
the Supporting Information).
We modeled risk of SIDS by the rate of breastfeeding in the
month before death (Vennemann et al., 2009) using 2012 mortality
data (Murphy et al., 2015), with age‐distribution‐based peak incidence
known to occur at 2–4 months of age (Shapiro‐Mendoza, Tomashek,
Anderson, & Wingo, 2006).
2.1.2

Maternal disease
Consistent with our prior maternal analysis (Bartick et al., 2013), we
included five diseases: breast cancer, pre‐menopausal ovarian cancer,
diabetes, hypertension, and myocardial infarction (MI; Collaborative
Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer, 2002; Danforth
et al., 2007; Stuebe et al., 2011). These conditions were selected
because published evidence continues to accumulate that longer
breastfeeding duration is associated with reduced disease risk, after
adjusting for parity as well as known or suspected confounders
(Chowdhury et al., 2015; Islami et al., 2015; Lupton, Chiu, Lujic,
Hennessy, & Lind, 2013). We updated the incidence data for all five
diseases used in 2013 model in the following ways: For breast and
ovarian cancer, we used updated data from Surveillance Epidemiol-
ogy and End Result database (SEER 18, 2008–2012; US Department
of Health and Human Services, National Cancer Institute and Surveil-
lance Epidemiology and End Results Program, 2015). For diabetes,
we used incidence data from the National Health Interview Survey
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013b). We calculated
hypertension incidence using data from 2009 to 2010 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention and National Center for Health Statistics,
2011). We calculated MI incidence using weighted data from the
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities (ARIC) Investigators, 2012).
2.2
|
Assumptions for the Monte Carlo simulation
model
We modeled a maximum parity of six, and we modeled the risk of
pregnancy by maternal age and cumulative parity using vital statistics
data from 2012 (see eTable 3; US Census Bureau Population Divi-
sion, 2003; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National
Center for Health Statistics, 2014; Martin et al., 2012). To estimate
our population size, we used census data for the number of women
who turned 15 years in 2002 (see Supporting Information). We
assumed
that
the
observed
multivariate‐adjusted
associations
between breastfeeding and disease outcomes are causal. Model
assumptions for breastfeeding, disease, and death rates, and associ-
ated costs follow.
2.2.1
|
Breastfeeding assumptions
Current breastfeeding rates were taken from the most recently
released National Immunization Survey (2012 birth cohort) and are
described as a percentage of infants breastfed, either exclusively
or non‐exclusively, for given durations (eTable 4). The duration
and exclusivity used was dependent on the literature for each dis-
ease examined, with the comparator being risk of disease compared
to no breastfeeding at all. For AOM, SIDS, and GII, both any and
exclusive breastfeeding were modeled. For example, we modeled
an
effect
on
AOM
of
both
any
breastfeeding
and
exclusive
breastfeeding for ≥4 months. Compared with infants who never
breastfeed, modeled infants who initiated breastfeeding had 0.77
odds
of
developing
AOM,

 exclusively breastfeeding at 4 months had 0.50 odds of subse-
quently developing AOM.
For preterm infants, we use breastfeeding rates reported by Rush
University Medical Center in Chicago, IL (Bigger et al., 2014) because it
is the largest, most current published prospective cohort study that
specifically include breast milk initiation, exclusivity, and duration for
preterm infants (see Supporting Information and eTables 1 and 2).
We assumed that breastfeeding duration for one birth is positively cor-
related with duration in the previous birth (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, 2007; Stuebe et al., 2011) based on data from the
Infant Feeding Practices Study II.
2.2.2
|
Disease rate assumptions
We used published studies, vital statistics data, and national preva-
lence and incidence data to derive our assumptions for expected dis-
ease rates for each disease (eTable 1a and b and eTables 5‐12). We
used previous methodology to calculate differential incidence of dis-
ease for breastfeeding and non‐breastfeeding women and children
(see Supporting Information; Bartick & Reinhold, 2010). In order to cal-
culate the differential incidence of disease in term infants and mothers,
we used breastfeeding rates from the years when the population for
the incidence data would have likely been breastfeeding. These years
depended both on the year in which the incident disease data were
collected and the latency period, if any, between breastfeeding and
disease onset. Historic breastfeeding data were taken from the
National Immunization Survey (Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, 2006, 2015) or the Ross Laboratories Mothers Survey (Ryan
et al., 2002). The risk that a simulated woman developed a disease in
a given year depended on her accumulated breastfeeding duration.
Consistent with the published literature, for diabetes and MI, the win-
dow during which breastfeeding conferred a reduced risk started after
her last birth and extended for 15 and 30 years thereafter,
respectively.
2.2.3
|
Death rate assumptions
We used published death rates for death from each maternal disease
and four pediatric diseases – ALL, NEC, LRTI, and SIDS – to estimate
the risk of death for simulated mothers and children who developed
these diseases (see Supporting Information and eTables 13‐5). Simu-
lated mothers and infants also had a risk of death in each year that
was independent of breastfeeding history, based on published vital
statistics data (Murphy et al., 2015). Mortality rates for diabetes,
hypertension, and MI were derived from the CDC WONDER database,
pooled from 1999 to 2013 for women 35–70 years of age (see
Supporting Information; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2013a). Mortality rates for ALL and breast and ovarian cancers were
taken from 10‐year survival rates from the Surveillance Epidemiology
and End Result database (US Department of Health and Human Ser-
vices, National Cancer Institute and Surveillance Epidemiology and
End Results Program, 2015).
2.2.4
|
Cost assumptions
Costs for each disease were estimated using published studies and/or
Medicare fee schedules (eTable 16a and b, Supporting Information,
and eTable 17). We assumed that costs for each disease occurred
in four mutually exclusive categories: direct medical costs, indirect
medical costs, indirect non‐medical costs, and premature death costs
(defined for women as death before age 70 years, because the
median lifespan of a 20‐year‐old woman in the United States is
81.2 years (Miniño, Heron, & Smith, 2006)). Direct medical costs
were defined as those costs required for the direct provision of med-
ical care for each disease (e.g., cost of medicines). Indirect medical
costs were defined as those costs that were indirectly required for
each disease (e.g., hospital overhead). Non‐medical costs were
defined as costs incurred by patients or families because of their dis-
ease (e.g., time missed from work); we excluded the cost of lost
wages due to premature death. Premature death cost was calculated,
separated, and defined as the age‐specific value of a statistical life,
which is a societal cost based on a willingness‐to‐pay model
(Entwistle, Mello, & Brennan, 2005). The value of a statistical life cost
in
2014
U.S.
dollars
was
$12,030,400
for
age
<25
years,
$12,399,402
for
ages
25–34
years,
$13,525,372
for
ages
35–44 years, $10,943,880 for ages 45–54 years, $5,080,597 for ages
55–62 years, and $2,952,239 for age >62 years (Aldy & Viscusi,
2007). Patients could incur medical and non‐medical costs both at
the time of each episode of disease as well as in the years following
their diagnosis if the disease had on‐going costs as determined by
published literature (see Supporting Information).

Procedures and analysis
2.3.1
|
Monte Carlo simulation
The simulation consisted of 10,000 replications of 100,000 women per
replication in each arm. We used a first‐order Markov process for each
breastfeeding scenario. The “suboptimal” arm used 2012 breastfeeding
rates, the most recent year for which final data are available. The “opti-
mal” arm assumed that 90% of infants were breastfed according to
medical recommendations. Consistent with previous models (Bartick
& Reinhold, 2010; Bartick et al., 2013; Weimer, 2001; Viscusi & Aldy,
2003),
we
classified
mothers
and
children
as
“exclusively
breastfeeding,” “partially breastfeeding,” or “non‐breastfeeding” (three
mutually exclusive categories) for up to 18 months after each birth.
Women (eFigure 1a) and children (eFigure 1b) in each of the simula-
tions were at risk of developing diseases, based on their age and cumu-
lative breastfeeding history. For AOM and GII, the same child could
experience multiple episodes of disease. For all other diseases, we
modeled up to a single episode per simulated individual. The frequency
with which pediatric conditions were modeled during the first year of
life varied by condition, and then annually thereafter to age 20 years
(see Supporting Information). Maternal conditions were modeled
annually, accruing over a 55‐year time period that ends when the
cohort turns 70. Simulated participants who died were censored from
the model.
All
relationships
between
lactation
and
disease
outcomes
described in the literature are estimates. To incorporate this uncer-
tainty into our models, we drew key parameters at random from trian-
gular distributions covering the range of estimates available in the

 disease outcomes, centered on the point estimate provided in the liter-
ature and a distribution width related to the standard error or confi-
dence interval reported in the literature. We analyzed variability in
our diseases over this population; this analysis represents a form of
probabilistic sensitivity analysis. (See Supporting Information for
details on how confidence intervals were calculated). All simulations
were performed in Java(™) SE Runtime Environment build 1.7.0_05‐
b06 (Oracle Corporation, Redwood Shores, CA, USA).

Cost
We used cost accounting techniques to estimate the costs of disease
and death predicted for each year of the simulation. To do this, we used
the following steps: (a) We converted the costs for each disease to
2014 U.S. dollars, using the U.S. consumer price index for general goods
(see Supporting Information; US Department of Labor Bureau of Labor
Statistics, 2015). (b) We multiplied the number of cases in each year by
the cost per case for each disease. (3) We applied a 2% discount to
yearly cost beginning when the simulated women turned 26 years,
which is the median age of first birth (Martin, Hamilton, Osterman, Cur-
tin, & Matthews, 2015), based on the assumption that this is the time
when investments to enable optimal breastfeeding would need to
begin. The 2% discount rate was chosen to reflect the current U.S. Fed-
eral Reserve policies on target inflation rates (Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System, 2016) as well as to reflect the inflation
experienced in the United States since 2009 that has been persistently
less than 3% (Coin News Media Group, 2016). (d) We summed
discounted costs across all years to calculate a total cost per disease.
(e) Finally, we subtracted the cost in the optimal arm from the cost in
the suboptimal arm to estimate the cost of suboptimal breastfeeding
across the lifetime of a single cohort of women and all the children born
to those women for the measured maternal and pediatric diseases. We
modeled outcomes for women of all races, with the exception of obe-
sity, which was limited to children of non‐Hispanic white women. All
cost accounting was performed in Excel 2010 (Redmond, WA).
The Institutional Review Board of the Cambridge Health Alliance
exempted the study.

RESULTS
In our models, 1.994 million simulated women gave birth to 3.75 mil-
lion infants. The predicted effects on maternal and child disease of
enabling 90% of women to breastfeeding optimally are shown in
Table 2. With the exception of premenopausal ovarian cancer and
ALL, there were significantly fewer deaths under optimal breastfeeding
conditions.
All
costs
were
significantly
lower
under
optimal
breastfeeding conditions, with the exception of pre‐menopausal ovar-
ian cancer. The costs of the changes in health outcomes are shown in
Table 3 and Figure 1. Maternal deaths represent 78% of all deaths.
Maternal costs represent 79% of total medical costs, 34% of non‐med-
ical costs, and 50% of premature death costs. We further considered
the number to treat (Altman, 1998), meaning the number of mother–
infant dyads that need to optimally breastfeed, to prevent specific dis-
eases. These figures ranged from 0.8 for infant GII (meaning less than
one mother would have to breastfeed all her children to prevent a case
of GII) and 3 for AOM, 55 for maternal hypertension, 95 for hospitali-
zation for LRTI, 235 for MI, 397 for breast cancer, and 2,379 for breast
cancer deaths. The number needed to treat to prevent one maternal or
child death was 597.

DISCUSSION
We found that suboptimal breastfeeding in the United States is cur-
rently associated with an excess of 3,340 premature maternal and child
deaths (95% CI [1,886 to 4,785]), due to seven different diseases. The
costs of suboptimal breastfeeding in 2014 U.S. dollars were $3.0 billion
for total medical costs, $1.3 billion for non‐medical costs, and $14.2
billion for premature death costs. Taken together, these findings sug-
gest that investments in strategies to enable more women to
breastfeed optimally would result in significant health and cost savings.
Our estimates are conservative, because we deliberately erred on
the side of underestimating, rather than overestimating, the health
impact of suboptimal breastfeeding. For maternal health outcomes,
more recent meta‐analyses for breast and ovarian cancers found
stronger protective associations between breastfeeding and maternal
disease risk, suggesting that more cases and deaths are incurred by
suboptimal breastfeeding than we found in our models (Chowdhury
et al., 2015). Our cost estimates for NEC are also conservative,
because we used direct costs estimates based on actual micro‐
accounting level costs (Johnson, Patel, Jegier, Engstrom, & Meier,
2013), whereas previous authors used charges (Bisquera, Cooper, &
Berseth, 2002), or cost‐to‐charge ratios (Ganapathy, Hay, & Kim,
2012). Finally, in contrast with recent work estimating $2.45 billion
in direct medical costs for child disease (2012 U.S. dollars; Rollins
et al., 2016), our medical cost estimates are lower than previously
reported, which was expected, given the changes in modeling strate-
gies, including removing diseases that are no longer considered to be
impacted by breastfeeding (e.g., atopic dermatitis and asthma), limit-
ing our analysis of obesity to non‐Hispanic white infants, using more
conservative cost figures for NEC, and lowering population incidence
of LRTIs.
Our results are consistent with previous analyses that demon-
strated excess disease, death, and cost when women and children
were separately modeled. Our model expands upon previous studies
by modeling a specific cohort of women and all the children born to
women during their reproductive lifetime. This is an important exten-
sion because it allows for estimation of cost savings following gradual
growth to optimal recommendations. It also enables demonstration of
savings from a single cohort of women. In reality, multiple cohorts of
women give birth each year. While some costs, such as paid maternity
leave, would require additional investment for each mother–infant
dyad,
other
infrastructure
changes,
such
as
comprehensive
breastfeeding training for health professionals, would not. Thus, it is
likely that investments in optimal breastfeeding would result in consid-
erably more costs savings with each subsequent cohort of women. Our
model also expands on earlier work in that very few systematic costs
studies conducted on breastfeeding account for uncertainty (Renfrew
et al., 2012).

bNumber needed to treat in this case refers to number of women needed to optimally breastfeed.
cFollowing Altman (1998) for numbers needed to treat where the results are not statistically significant, we show a confidence interval from a negative value,
which would indicate a number needed to harm through infinity to a positive value, indicating a number needed to benefit, effectively an interval in the real
projective line that includes the mean value.
dNecrotizing enterocolitis numbers needed to optimally breastfeed used the number of infants 400–1500 g that would need to be breastfed optimally to
prevent a case or a death. In 2012, there were 53,022 very low birth weight infants. See Supporting Information for details.
ePopulation used for all obesity calculations is that of non‐Hispanic white 15‐year‐old young women in 2002: 1,259,336. See Supporting Information for
details and references.
fTotals may not always add up due to rounding. Totals do not include results that are not statistically significant, nor do the confidence intervals for the totals
include the confidence intervals for the non‐significant findings.
gCombined maternal and child number needed to treat is calculated using the population of all mothers for necrotizing enterocolitis, not using the population
of preterm infants.

 We found a substantially larger impact of breastfeeding on
women's health, compared with infant health, as the majority of excess
deaths and direct health costs from suboptimal breastfeeding are
related to women's health outcomes. Breastfeeding has historically
been viewed as a children's health issue; however, our results suggest
that breastfeeding support must be seen as fundamental to all preven-
tive health strategies for women. Further studies are needed to iden-
tify the extent to which specific interventions can enable women to

 establish and sustain optimal breastfeeding and to determine which
strategies
are
cost‐effective.
Systemic
approaches
are
needed,
because current social constructs in the United States make it difficult
for women to breastfeed. These constructs include lack of paid mater-
nity leave, inadequate access to appropriate lactation care and ser-
vices,
and
limited
implementation
of
evidence‐based
maternity
practices that support breastfeeding. As a result, CDC data show that
60% of women do not meet their own breastfeeding goals (Perrine,
Scanlon, Li, Odom, & Grummer‐Strawn, 2012). Further, it must be
noted that the non‐medical costs are disproportionately borne by
women, which has implications for public policy decisions regarding
gender equality and career opportunities. Taken together, our results
suggest that investment in interventions that enable women to meet
their personal infant feeding goals would save lives and dollars.
In terms of numbers to treat (i.e., numbers of women needed to
optimally breastfeed), our results suggest that optimal breastfeeding
compares favorably with routinely recommended public health inter-
ventions including aspirin for secondary prevention of cardiovascular
events (NNT: 333 for secondary cardiovascular events; Newman,
2011). If observed associations are causal, breastfeeding offers wide-
spread public health advantages for multiple disease processes across
the lifespan. On a population level, enabling more families to achieve
optimal breastfeeding would result in substantial individual and socie-
tal gains.

LIMITATIONS
We found that significant savings are possible if optimal breastfeeding
were achieved; however, our findings must be interpreted in the con-
text of the study design. First, like most economic analyses, our analy-
sis used assumptions for its model parameters including assumptions
related to breastfeeding, disease rates, death rates, and cost. If any
of these assumptions are incorrect or overstated, our analysis could
over‐estimate cases averted and cost savings. In order to minimize this
potential, we used the most conservative estimates throughout the
analysis, and we provided an extensive Supporting Information that
details our methodology and values used. This will allow future
research to further test or change the values used as new research
emerges. It should be noted that for many of the childhood diseases
and all of the maternal diseases, “any breastfeeding” is the comparator
to no breastfeeding, rather than exclusive breastfeeding. As there is lit-
tle data on maternal disease and exclusive breastfeeding and limited
data on some of the childhood diseases and exclusivity, we could be
underestimating the risks, given lack of data on optimal breastfeeding
for many of the diseases that we studied.

breastfeeding and disease are causal. It is possible that some of the
observed associations are confounded by other factors; however, we
used relative risks from the published literature that controlled for mul-
tiple socio‐demographic confounders. While causality cannot be
proven from observational studies, a causal association between
breastfeeding and health outcomes is supported by effect size, repro-
ducibility, temporality, biologic gradient, biologic plausibility, and in
many cases laboratory evidence (Smith & Harvey, 2011).
Third, our findings assume a steady breastfeeding state through
the lifetime of the modeled cohort. In fact, breastfeeding rates con-
tinue to increase, particularly since 2010, as the result of numerous
national, state, and non‐profit initiatives. In addition, incidence of sev-
eral infant diseases has declined since 2005, when our previous pedi-
atric analysis was modeled: mortality from SIDS, NEC, and LRTI has
decreased by 21%, 38%, and 30%, respectively (Kung, Hoyert, Xu, &
Murphy, 2008; Murphy et al., 2015). To the extent that these trends
in breastfeeding and infant disease burden continue, the difference
between current suboptimal and optimal conditions may be smaller
than modeled in our simulation. Similarly, MI mortality decreased by
24% from 1999 to 2008 (Yeh et al., 2010), and our model does not
account for future reductions in mortality. Furthermore, our model
assumes steady‐state patterns of childbearing in the U.S. population
over time. An increase in birth rates could increase the health impact
of breastfeeding, whereas a decline in birth rates could decrease the
impact, because there would be fewer children born and fewer oppor-
tunities for women to breastfeed. In addition, the use of U.S. costs may
limit generalizability of our results to other countries. We also recog-
nize that selection of appropriate costs for loss of life is controversial.
Lastly, confidence intervals around some estimates were wide,
reflecting imprecision in the extant literature regarding the impact of
breastfeeding on health. Of note, our model is the first to include this
uncertainty in a comprehensive model of maternal and child outcomes,
and
we
deliberately
made
conservative
assumptions
to
avoid
overstating the impact of breastfeeding on health and costs.

CONCLUSIONS
Suboptimal breastfeeding is associated with considerable health
impact, and cost in the United States has a larger impact on women's
health than previously appreciated. Efforts to enable more families to
breastfeed may need to be realigned to focus more on women's health.
Our results suggest that women's health providers require training in
lactation support and management as an integral part of preventive
health for women. Increased investment in public health programs

 and social policies that enable more women to breastfeed optimally
may be cost‐effective.
