BACKGROUND
In X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, mutations in ABCD1 lead to loss of function of the 
ALD protein. Cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy is characterized by demyelination and 
neurodegeneration. Disease progression, which leads to loss of neurologic function 
and death, can be halted only with allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.
METHODS
We enrolled boys with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy in a single-group, open-label, 
phase 2–3 safety and efficacy study. Patients were required to have early-stage disease 
and gadolinium enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at screening. 
The investigational therapy involved infusion of autologous CD34+ cells transduced 
with the elivaldogene tavalentivec (Lenti-D) lentiviral vector. In this interim analysis, 
patients were assessed for the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease, death, and 
major functional disabilities, as well as changes in neurologic function and in the 
extent of lesions on MRI. The primary end point was being alive and having no 
major functional disability at 24 months after infusion.
RESULTS
A total of 17 boys received Lenti-D gene therapy. At the time of the interim analysis, 
the median follow-up was 29.4 months (range, 21.6 to 42.0). All the patients had gene-
marked cells after engraftment, with no evidence of preferential integration near 
known oncogenes or clonal outgrowth. Measurable ALD protein was observed in all 
the patients. No treatment-related death or graft-versus-host disease had been report-
ed; 15 of the 17 patients (88%) were alive and free of major functional disability, with 
minimal clinical symptoms. One patient, who had had rapid neurologic deterioration, 
had died from disease progression. Another patient, who had had evidence of disease 
progression on MRI, had withdrawn from the study to undergo allogeneic stem-
cell transplantation and later died from transplantation-related complications.
CONCLUSIONS
Early results of this study suggest that Lenti-D gene therapy may be a safe and 
effective alternative to allogeneic stem-cell transplantation in boys with early-stage 
cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy. Additional follow-up is needed to fully assess the 
duration of response and long-term safety. (Funded by Bluebird Bio and others;

Gene Therapy for Cerebral Adrenoleukodystrophy
A 
drenoleukodystrophy is an X-linked 
genetic disease that is caused by a defect 
in the gene ABCD1 (ATP-binding cassette, 
subfamily D, member 1), which encodes the per-
oxisomal ABC half-transporter ALD protein.1 Mu-
tations in ABCD1 result in abnormal breakdown of 
very-long-chain fatty acids, a process that pre-
dominantly affects adrenal and nervous-system 
tissues. The inflammatory cerebral phenotype 
known as cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy devel-
ops in approximately 35% of affected boys young-
er than 12 years of age and in a smaller percent-
age of affected patients 12 years of age or older.2,3 
Learning and behavioral manifestations of cere-
bral adrenoleukodystrophy are often observed 
when affected patients are between the ages of 
3 and 15 years (median age, 7 years) and are often 
followed by rapidly progressive loss of neuro-
logic function. Most patients with cerebral adre-
noleukodystrophy die within a decade after they 
receive the diagnosis if they are not treated with 
hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.4
Allogeneic transplantation is the only effective 
therapy for cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy that 
has been identified to date, and it is more likely 
to be effective if it is performed at an early stage 
of neurodegeneration.5-8 Among symptomatic boys 
who have a high burden of cerebral white-matter 
disease at diagnosis, the outcome of transplan-
tation is often unfavorable. In contrast, among 
boys who have undergone transplantation for 
presymptomatic disease that has been detected by 
means of early findings on imaging studies, good 
function and survival have been observed. Thus, 
rapid identification of potential highly matched 
hematopoietic stem-cell donors is important to 
ensure timely treatment. The long-term benefits 
of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in cere-
bral adrenoleukodystrophy are thought to be me-
diated by donor-derived replacement of myeloid-
derived cells, possibly including microglial cells.2,9 
There are notable limitations to allogeneic trans-
plantation, including the risks of graft failure 
and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The most 
successful outcomes to date have been achieved 
with the use of cells from HLA-identical, unaf-
fected related donors.10 Among patients who un-
dergo transplantation with cells from such donors 
and do not have clinical evidence of disease, over-
all survival is good; treatment failure is usually 
due to transplantation-related complications or 
rapid disease progression during the engraftment 
of donor cells. In a small, single-center study, early 
transplantation with cells from matched related 
donors, which are available in a minority of cases, 
resulted in 100% survival.10
Gene therapy with autologous hematopoietic 
stem cells has been investigated as an alterna-
tive to allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell trans-
plantation.11-13 In the initial proof-of-principle, 
single-center study, four boys with cerebral adre-
noleukodystrophy received autologous CD34+ 
hematopoietic stem cells transduced ex vivo with 
a lentiviral vector CG1711hALD that contained 
ABCD1 complementary DNA (cDNA). Results for 
two of those patients have been reported; both 
patients had functional expression of ALD protein 
and disease stabilization.14
We report the initial results of the STARBEAM 
study (ALD-102), an ongoing multicenter, single-
group, open-label, phase 2–3 study of gene thera-
py with the Lenti-D drug product, which involves 
infusion of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem 
cells transduced ex vivo with the elivaldogene 
tavalentivec (Lenti-D) lentiviral vector that con-
tains ABCD1 cDNA.
Methods
Study Design and Investigational Therapy
The primary aim of the STARBEAM study is to 
assess the safety and efficacy of gene therapy with 
the Lenti-D drug product in male patients 17 years 
of age or younger who have cerebral adrenoleuko-
dystrophy. The study protocols were approved by 
the requisite regulatory and human-protection 
committees. Patients were enrolled after a guard-
ian provided consent and, when appropriate, the 
patient provided assent. Eligibility was restricted 
to patients who had gadolinium enhancement on 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to cere-
bral adrenoleukodystrophy and had the following 
signs of early-stage disease: a score on the cerebral 
adrenoleukodystrophy–specific neurologic func-
tion scale15 (which ranges from 0 to 25, with 
higher scores indicating more severe deficits) of 
0 or 1, and a Loes score16 (which ranges from 0 to 
34, with higher scores indicating an increased 
extent of lesions on MRI) of 0.5 to 9.0 (for fur-
ther details, see the Supplementary Appendix, 
available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org). Patients who had an HLA-matched 
sibling who could donate cells for transplanta-
tion were excluded from the study.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
A total of 18 patients were enrolled in the 
study; 1 of these patients did not meet the eligibil-
ity criteria. In 2016, after consultation with regu-
latory authorities, the target for enrollment was 
increased to 25 patients (but this target did not 
apply to the interim analysis).
CD34+ cells that were obtained from the en-
rolled patients by means of apheresis were trans-
duced with the Lenti-D lentiviral vector. Cell trans-
duction was performed in accordance with Good 
Manufacturing Practice conditions with the use 
of uniform and validated standard operating pro-
cedures. Patients received conditioning with bu-
sulfan and cyclophosphamide, after which the 
investigational drug product, which was made up 
of the transduced CD34+ cells, was infused. In the 
primary clinical study, the patients were followed 
for 2 years and then were offered enrollment in a 
13-year long-term follow-up study. (For further 
details, see Fig. S1 and the Methods Section in 
the Supplementary Appendix.)
Clinical, Imaging, and Laboratory 
Assessments
Patients were assessed regularly for adverse events 
and disease progression (see the study protocol, 
available at NEJM.org). Gadolinium enhancement 
and lesion progression were evaluated by an expe-
rienced neuroradiologist who was unaware of 
patient identity, time since the infusion of the 
investigational drug product, and clinical status. 
The Loes score was used to assess the extent of 
lesions on MRI of the head; it is a commonly 
used assessment in patients with cerebral adre-
noleukodystrophy.16 A score of less than 0.5 is 
considered to be normal. A stable Loes score was 
defined as an increase from baseline of less than 
6 points or a score of 9 or less.
The cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy–specific 
neurologic function scale was used to evaluate the 
severity of gross neurologic dysfunction through 
an assessment for 15 disabilities across multiple 
domains.15 A score of 0 indicates the absence of 
clinical signs of cerebral disease. The 6 most 
severe disabilities included in the assessment are 
loss of communication, cortical blindness, tube 
feeding, total incontinence, wheelchair depen-
dence, and complete loss of voluntary movement. 
These disabilities were judged to be of particular 
importance because they severely compromise a 
patient’s ability to function independently. Each 
of the 6 disabilities is classified in this study as 
a major functional disability (Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The primary efficacy 
end point was being alive and having no major 
functional disabilities at 24 months.
Peripheral-blood mononuclear cells and the 
CD14+ cell fraction were assessed for expression 
of ALD protein with the use of flow cytometry. 
The vector copy number was determined with the 
use of a quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction 
(PCR) assay. For analysis of vector integration 
sites, DNA was purified from peripheral-blood 
samples, and the total number of unique inte-
gration sites and the relative clonal contribution 
of the 10 most common integration sites were 
determined by means of linear amplification–
mediated PCR, as described previously.17 All de-
tectable integration sites were aggregated and 
analyzed. (For further details, see the Methods 
Section and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.)
Study Oversight
The study was performed with approval from the 
Food and Drug Administration for an investiga-
tional new drug and with approval from Europe-
an national authorities. The study was designed 
by six of the authors and the study sponsor, 
Bluebird Bio. The first two authors wrote the first 
draft of the manuscript, which was revised by the 
last author and substantively edited and approved 
by all the authors. All the authors made the deci-
sion to submit the manuscript for publication. 
Editorial assistance for an earlier version of the 
article was provided by employees of Bluebird Bio. 
The authors had access to the full data from the 
study, which were provided by Bluebird Bio. Labo-
ratory data were generated by the authors and 
Bluebird Bio. Clinical data were collected by the 
authors, who performed the treatment and were 
responsible for all follow-up and clinical decisions. 
An independent data and safety monitoring board 
reviewed the safety data. The authors vouch for the 
completeness and accuracy of the data and of in-
terpretation of the data and for adherence of the 
study to the protocol. Additional details regarding 
the study design are provided in the protocol.

age at the time of enrollment, received the inves-
tigational gene therapy (Table 1). At baseline, the 
median Loes score was 2.0 (range, 1.0 to 7.5), and 
all the patients had a score of 0 on the neuro-
logic function scale. Apheresis for manufacture of 
the Lenti-D drug product was accomplished with a 
single mobilization cycle and took one day for 7 of 
the patients and two days for 10 of the patients.
Patients received the Lenti-D drug product, 
which contained 6.0 million to 19.4 million 
CD34+ cells per kilogram of body weight, with 
a vector copy number of 0.5 to 2.5 (Table 1). 
After the initial 4 patients were treated, the re-
maining 13 patients received granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor (G-CSF) after the infusion to 
expedite engraftment. After the infusion, all the 
patients had neutrophil engraftment (median 
days to neutrophil engraftment, 31 [range, 20 to 
39] without G-CSF and 12 [range, 11 to 20] with 
G-CSF), and all the patients had platelet engraft-
ment (median days to platelet engraftment, 32 
[range, 28 to 37] without G-CSF and 27 [range, 
16 to 55] with G-CSF).
Data on the interim safety and efficacy as-
sessments were available as of April 2017. At the 
time of data cutoff, the median follow-up after 
infusion was 29.4 months (range, 21.6 to 42.0), 
16 of the 17 patients could be evaluated for the 
primary end point (i.e., had reached 24 months 
of follow-up), and 14 were enrolled in the long-
term follow-up study.
Safety Outcomes
No toxic effects related to the infusion of the 
Lenti-D drug product were reported. Most adverse 
events associated with the treatment occurred dur-
ing the conditioning phase or the first 2 weeks 
after the infusion, and they were generally consis-
tent with the adverse events associated with my-
eloablative chemotherapy. One patient had hem-
orrhagic cystitis associated with BK virus on day 
42. BK virus is a human polyomavirus that has 
been implicated as a common cause of late-onset 
hemorrhagic cystitis in patients who have under-
gone hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. In 
this case, the cystitis resolved with conservative 
measures and was deemed to be possibly related 
to the drug product. No episodes of graft failure 
or GVHD were reported. There were no transplan-
tation-related deaths. Serious adverse events and 
adverse events related to the drug product are 
listed in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Biomarkers
Integration-site analysis revealed polyclonal re-
constitution of peripheral blood. The total num-
ber of unique vector integration sites was between 
251 and 5428. No integration site accounted for 
more than 30% of the total integration events on 
two consecutive tests. The vector copy number in 
peripheral blood ranged from 0.10 to 1.55 at 
month 24 (assessed in 14 patients) and from 
0.36 to 1.83 at month 36 (assessed in 3 patients) 
(Fig. 1A); the number had generally stabilized by 
2 months after infusion. No preferential integra-
tion was detected in or near genes that have previ-
ously been involved in serious adverse events as-
sociated with gene therapy (e.g., MDS1, EVI1, and 
LMO2). The 10 most common integration sites

for each patient at the most recent follow-up are 
shown in Figure S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix. Expression of ALD protein in peripheral-
blood leukocytes was observed in all the patients 
at the most recent follow-up (Fig. 1B). The per-
centage of CD14+ cells that expressed ALD pro-
tein ranged from 5.4 to 71.4% at 6 months after 
infusion (median, 14.3%; assessed in 13 patients), 
from 6.9 to 54.5% at 12 months (median, 16.1%; 
assessed in 17 patients), from 4.9 to 54.8% at 18 
months (median, 17.0%; assessed in 14 patients), 
and from 6.4 to 44.6% at 24 months (median, 
19.0%; assessed in 13 patients) (Fig. 1B). Plasma 
levels of very-long-chain fatty acids were unaf-
fected by treatment with Lenti-D. (For further de-
tails, see Figs. S2, S3, and S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.)
Clinical Outcomes
At the time of the interim analysis, 15 of the 17 
patients (88%) were alive and free of major func-
tional disabilities; these 15 patients maintained 
a score on the neurologic function scale of 0 or 
1 (Fig. 2A). Two patients had neurologic disease 
progression. One of these patients (Patient 2016) 
withdrew from the study and later died from

Gene Therapy for Cerebral Adrenoleukodystrophy
complications of allogeneic transplantation. In 
the other patient (Patient 2018), neurologic func-
tion deteriorated rapidly after treatment; a major 
functional disability (total incontinence) devel-
oped by month 9, and additional major functional 
disabilities continued to develop, including cortical 
blindness, loss of communication, and wheel-
chair dependence. Approximately 22 months after 
the infusion, the patient died from a viral infec-
tion complicated by rhabdomyolysis and acute 
kidney and liver failure; these complications and 
the immediate cause of death were judged to be 
not directly related to the investigational therapy. 
Shortly after data cutoff (at month 25), a patient 
(Patient 2013) had a score on the neurologic func-
tion scale of 2, as the result of a seizure, but had 
no other evidence of disease progression.
An exploratory analysis was designed to evalu-
ate possible relationships between drug-product 
characteristics and clinical outcomes, including 
the occurrence of major functional disability or 
death and the occurrence of any change in neuro-
logic function during the study. In the analysis, 
outcomes were plotted as a function of the vec-
tor copy number in the drug product. Worse clini-
cal outcomes appeared to occur in patients who 
were treated with a drug product that had a lower 
vector copy number (Fig. 2B).
Neuroimaging
At the time of the interim analysis, lesion pro-
gression, as measured with the Loes score, had 
stabilized in 12 of the 17 patients (71%) (Fig. 3). 
Patient 2018, who had a relatively high Loes score 
of 7 at baseline, had rapid disease progression on 
MRI after treatment, during the early engraft-
ment phase; the Loes score was 23 by month 12 
and 25 by month 18. Patient 2016, who had new 
white-matter lesions by month 12, was withdrawn 
from the study by the treating physicians to un-
dergo allogeneic stem-cell transplantation and 
later died from transplantation-related causes.
Gadolinium enhancement, which was present 
at baseline in all the patients, had resolved by 
month 6 in the 16 patients who could be evalu-
ated (Fig. 4). In 6 patients, diffuse gadolinium en-
hancement reemerged at month 12; the enhance-
ment resolved again in 5 of these patients for 
whom results of later MRIs were available. Dif-
fuse gadolinium enhancement reemerged in 2 of 
these patients at month 24; in addition, 1 patient 
had reemergence of enhancement at months 18 
and 24, and Patient 2010 had reemergence of 
enhancement at month 24. In all the patients who 
had reemergence of gadolinium enhancement, 
the enhancement was less extensive than the 
Figure 2. Neurologic Function and Clinical Outcomes Relative to Vector 
Copy Number in the Drug Product.
Panel A shows the scores on the cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy–specific 
neurologic function scale (which ranges from 0 to 25, with higher scores 
indicating more severe deficits) for each of the 17 patients at various time 
points after the infusion of the Lenti-D drug product; 12 patients had 
scores of 0 at all time points, with the last measurement obtained at 
month 36 (in 3 patients), month 30 (2), month 24 (5), or month 18 (2). The 
scale is used to evaluate the severity of gross neurologic dysfunction 
through an assessment for 15 disabilities across multiple domains; a score 
of 0 indicates the absence of clinical signs of cerebral disease. Panel B 
shows the clinical outcomes in the patients relative to the vector copy 
number in the drug product. Green circles represent patients with stable 
disease, and red triangles represent patients with a change in status. A 
change in neurologic function was defined as any change from baseline in 
the score on the neurologic function scale.

Discussion
The goal of treatment of cerebral adrenoleuko-
dystrophy is to halt progression of the disease as 
quickly and as safely as possible, thereby prevent-
ing the development of irreversible impairments, 
which compromise the ability to function inde-
pendently.8 Hematopoietic stem-cell transplanta-
tion performed in the early stages of progressive 
cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy is known to be 
beneficial.4 Allogeneic transplantation has been 
shown to eventually halt disease progression in 
many patients, although some white-matter dis-
ease progression on MRI is commonly observed 
during the first 12 to 18 months after transplan-
tation.6,7,18
Early results suggest that Lenti-D treatment is 
safe and has led to clinical stabilization in a large 
proportion of patients in this study. At the time 
of data cutoff, gene therapy was considered to be 
effective in 15 of the 17 patients who received 
treatment; 1 patient had multiple major functional 
disabilities, and 1 patient withdrew from the study. 
Most patients had stable neurologic function after 
Lenti-D treatment; 14 of the 17 patients remained 
free of major functional disabilities and had a 
score on the neurologic function scale of 0 or 1, 
indicating no or minimal clinical symptoms. 
Aside from the patient who withdrew from the 
study, 1 patient had a score on the neurologic 
function scale of 2 at 25 months after infusion 
(after a reported seizure), and 1 patient had mul-
tiple major functional disabilities, the earliest of 
which was evident at month 9. This patient had 
a rapid increase in both the Loes score and the 
score on the neurologic function scale as early 
as 2 weeks after treatment, findings that suggested 
that he may have had marked disease progression 
before treatment. The patient died from a viral 
infection complicated by rhabdomyolysis and acute 
kidney and liver failure. Similar to allogeneic trans-
plantation,19 hematopoietic stem-cell gene therapy 
is not expected to have an effect on the pheno-
types of adrenomyeloneuropathy or adrenal in-
sufficiency.
At the time of the interim analysis, boys with 
cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy who had received 
Lenti-D therapy had generally stable disease or 
limited progression of disease on MRI of the 
head, as compared with the known rates of lesion 
progression among untreated boys (mean [±SD] 
Figure 3. Extent of Lesions on MRI.
Shown are the Loes scores for each of the 17 patients at various time points 
after the infusion of the Lenti-D drug product. The Loes scores range from 0 to 
34, with higher scores indicating an increased extent of lesions on magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI). A score of 0.5 or less is considered to be normal.

Figure 4. Gadolinium Enhancement on MRI.
Shown are the results of assessments for gadolinium enhancement on MRI 
for each of the 17 patients at various time points after the infusion of the 
Lenti-D drug product. Gadolinium enhancement on reemergence after ini-
tial resolution was uniformly more diffuse than the enhancement seen at 
baseline but was still assessed as positive. Patient 2016 withdrew from the 
study at month 13. To review the MRIs, see Figure S5 in the Supplementary

Gene Therapy for Cerebral Adrenoleukodystrophy
increase in Loes score, 2.2±0.55 and 2.3±0.75 
points per year for the posterior and anterior pat-
terns, respectively).20 Neither hematopoietic stem-
cell transplantation nor gene therapy appears to 
prevent white-matter lesion progression during 
the initial 12 to 18 months after treatment.6,7 
Microglial cell death appears to play an impor-
tant role in the pathophysiology of cerebral ad-
renoleukodystrophy,2 and therefore, early disease 
progression may occur during the time before 
replacement of microglial cells. Our data and 
the results of studies of allogeneic transplanta-
tion show that some disease progression on MRI 
during the first year after transplantation is 
common and therefore reinforce the urgency in 
identifying cerebral disease early and treating it 
swiftly. Infusion of autologous stem cells may 
have an advantage over allogeneic transplantation 
in this sense, because of the time saved by not 
needing to find a donor.
Although the presence of gadolinium enhance-
ment before treatment has been clearly correlated 
with rapid disease progression, the kinetics of 
gadolinium enhancement after clinically success-
ful allogeneic transplantation are not well un-
derstood. More data are needed to determine the 
importance of an evaluation of gadolinium en-
hancement after treatment in the assessment of 
the treatment response. Early results suggest that 
gadolinium enhancement does not appear to cor-
relate with clinical outcomes after treatment.
Patients who have very rapidly progressive dis-
ease at the time of infusion may go on to have 
severe clinical symptoms. The quality of the drug 
product for autologous gene therapy, including 
the number of engraftable transduced stem cells 
and the level of expression of the transgene, may 
be critical to the prevention of neurologic disease 
progression. Although the sample size in this 
study is too small to allow statistical inferences, 
data from patients who had major functional dis-
abilities or deterioration of neurologic function 
appeared to cluster at the lower end of the range 
for vector copy number.
We found no correlation between outcome 
and plasma level of very-long-chain fatty acids. It 
has been established that the plasma level of very-
long-chain fatty acids does not correlate with the 
clinical severity or phenotype of ALD.21 Thus, 
since expression of ALD protein is probably re-
lated in part to vector copy number, a remaining 
issue that is not addressed by the current study 
is the effect of higher expression of the trans-
gene in the progeny of transduced cells.
During the peritransplantation period, allo-
geneic transplantation requires immunosuppres-
sion, which has the potential to increase the risk 
of life-threatening infections. Among patients with 
cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy and other inherited 
metabolic disorders, allogeneic transplantation 
has been associated with a 100-day mortality 
rate of 8%, a 1-year mortality rate of 18%, a rate 
of graft failure of 6 to 14%, a rate of serious 
infection of 29%, a rate of acute grade 2, 3, or 4 
GVHD of 8 to 45%, and a rate of chronic GVHD 
of up to 21%.5,10,22-24 Among patients in our study, 
who underwent gene therapy with an autologous 
approach, no GVHD or life-threatening infections 
were noted.
There have been concerns about mutagenesis 
related to viral integration after the addition of a 
gene to hematopoietic stem cells ever since leuke-
mia and the myelodysplastic syndrome developed 
in patients who were treated with gamma-retro-
viral vector gene therapy for several immunode-
ficiency diseases.25-28 Unlike the retroviral vectors 
used in those studies, the Lenti-D lentiviral vec-
tor (as well as other lentiviral and gamma-retro-
viral vectors that are enhancer-deleted with the 
use of a self-inactivating vector design) so far 
appears to reduce the risk of mutagenesis.29-32 A 
longer follow-up and a larger sample size are re-
quired to confirm the low potential for genotoxic 
effects and the clinical efficacy and safety of gene 
therapy with the Lenti-D lentiviral vector.
