Abstract 
Introduction: The links between gambling problems, trauma and life stressors are known to 
exist but understanding the extent of these relationships will allow for greater  efficacy in early 
intervention and treatment.  We investigated these relationships among men and sought to 
determine whether links were attenuated by alcohol and drug use problems.  
Methods: A cross-sectional UK representative general population survey was conducted in 
2009 with 3025 men aged 18-64 years.  Measurements included self-reported gambling 
behaviours, as measured by the South Oaks Gambling Scale (SOGS) and traumatic or 
stressful life events.  Covariates included alcohol and drug dependence and socio-
demographics.  Binary logistic regression models were used to examine associations.   
Results: Problem gambling (SOGS 3-4) and probable pathological gambling (SOGS 5+) were 
associated with increased odds of trauma in childhood (e.g. violence in the home (Adjusted 
Odd Ratios (AOR) 3.0 (CI =1.8-5.0) and 2.6 (CI =1.7-4.1) respectively), and life stressors in 
adulthood (e.g. intimate partner violence (AORs 4.5 (CI =2.0-10.3) and 4.7 (CI =2.3-9.7) and 
homelessness (AORs 2.2 (CI 1.1-4.6) and 3.2 (CI =1.9-5.5)). Results were attenuated when 
adjusted for probable alcohol and drug dependence with the latter having largest effects.  
Conclusions: Among men in the United Kingdom, disordered gambling remains uniquely 
associated with trauma and life stressors in childhood and adulthood after adjusting for alcohol 
and drug dependence.  The results support a need for disordered gambling treatment services 
to undertake routine screening for alcohol, drugs, IPV and traumatic life events and to tailor 
treatment that specifically targets the effects of stress for clients who present with such a 
cluster of issues.

1. Introduction. 
The increased accessibility of gambling products (Griffiths, Parke, Wood, & Parke, 2006) has 
coincided with changes in gambling participation and associated harm at a population level 
(Cowlishaw & Kessler,  2016; Wardle et al., 2011).  In Great Britain, approximately 7% of 
adults are at risk of experiencing harm from their gambling, with 0.7% being classified as 
problem gamblers (Wardle et al., 2011). Problem and pathological gambling are characterised 
by persistent maladaptive gambling that leads to social harm and damage to family, personal 
or recreational pursuits (Delfrabbo, 2013; Lesieur & Rosenthal, 1991). The terminology used 
to describe problem gambling is variable, with the terms “problem,” “pathological” and 
“compulsive” gambling used interchangeably in the literature (Blaszczynski & Nower, 2002).  
Gambling was re-classified from an impulse control disorder to a behavioural addiction in the 
recent version of the Diagnostic Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric 
Association, 2013), and renamed under the umbrella term “disordered gambling” in 
recognition of the similarities between behavioural and substance addictions (Grant, Potenza, 
Weinstein, & Gorelick, 2010).     
 
Early life stressors, specifically adverse childhood experiences and trauma, increase risk for 
psychopathology later in life, including the development of disordered gambling (Brydges, 
Holmes, Harris, Cardinal, & Hall, 2015).  Such adverse experiences can include emotional 
abuse, physical neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse (Bernstein et al., 1994) and 
interpersonal trauma (e.g. exposure to interpersonal violence (IPV) or violence in the home) 
(Catalano, 2013; Romita, Turan, & De Marchi, 2005). Several studies have shown a high 
incidence of childhood maltreatment, trauma and abuse in disordered gambling groups (e.g., 
Afifi, Brownridge, MacMillan, & Sareen, 2010; Echeburua, Gonzalez-Ortega, de Corral, & 
Polo-Lopez, 2011; Hodgins et al., 2010; Kausch, Rugle, & Rowland, 2006; Lane et al., 2016; 
Petry & Steinberg, 2005; Sharma & Sacco, 2015).  While these links are compelling, few 
studies have considered both traumatic, and stressful life events.  As classified in the DSM-
IV, traumatic events are exceptionally stressful and emotionally distressing events that are 
typically unpredictable in nature, distinguished by responses involving intense fear, 
helplessness and horror (APA, 2013).  More general experiences of stressful life events ( eg 
job loss/homelessness) in adulthood are not usually characterised by the same extreme 
psychological responses (Kausch et al., 2006, Sharma & Sacco, 2015).  This distinction is 
important, since associations with traumatic events might indicate increased vulnerability to 
developing gambling problems, while associations with other types of stressful life event (e.g. 
job loss) might indicate consequential harms associated with gambling. Furthermore, there 
are few studies which have attempted to evaluate when the traumatic or stressful life event 
occurred. This is notwithstanding that adult (proximal) events may be as relevant as childhood 
  
4 
(distal) events in the development of addiction psychopathology (e.g. Shaffer et al., 2004; 
Whitesell et al., 2007).  In the syndrome model of addiction (Shaffer et al., 2004), for example, 
it is suggested that multiple determinants, including distal (e.g. genetic, post-traumatic stress 
disorder) and proximal (e.g. reward value, psychiatric morbidity) events can all influence the 
likelihood of developing addiction.  
 
Disordered gambling is often co-morbid with other behavioural and psychological disorders, 
which can exacerbate, or be exacerbated by gambling (e.g. Afifi et al., 2010; Korman et al., 
2008; Scherrer et al., 2007).  It is recognised that disordered gamblers exhibit elevated levels 
of a comorbid mental health disorders, with substance related disorders being particularly 
common.  A recent meta-analysis of comorbid disorders in disordered gamblers revealed that 
the weighted mean effect size for substance use disorders was 57 % (Lorains, Cowlishaw, & 
Thomas, 2011); and substance use disorders often occur alongside traumatic and stressful 
live events (e.g. Enoch, 2011; Reynolds et al., 2005).  Multiple pathways have been proposed 
to explain the temporal link between trauma and substance abuse (e.g. Giaconia, Reinherz, 
Paradis, & Stashwick, 2003).  One such explanation is that early traumatic experience may 
increase the risk of substance use disorders because of efforts to self-medicate or reduce 
negative mood (Khoury, Tang, Bradley, Cubells, & Ressler, 2010).  Surprisingly, given these 
patterns of comorbidity, few studies have investigated whether substance and alcohol use 
problems may explain the relationship between disordered gambling and traumatic life events 
(Echeburua et al., 2011; Korman et al., 2008; Leppink & Grant, 2015; Scherrer et al., 2007; 
Schluter, Abbott, & Bellringer, 2008).   
 
The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between gambling problems, trauma 
and life stressors in both childhood and adulthood.  The present study is unique in that a 
nationally representative sample of UK men was used to examine the relationship between 
the entire spectrum of of gambling behaviours (not just those with severe psychopathology 
including non-problem gamblers), and the experience of trauma in childhood (distal events) 
and trauma and life stressors in adulthood (proximal events), while considering the roles that 
drug and alcohol misuse may play. The paper also sought to extend the findings using the 
same sample in which self-reports of problem/ pathological gambling were predictive of a 
range of measures of violent behaviour (Roberts et al., 2016), where gambling remained 
predictive of a range of measures of violent behaviour after adjusting for alcohol and drug 
dependence, comorbid mental disorder and impulsivity.  However, while the earlier paper 
examined violent perpetration, the present paper explored IPV and injury from a victim 
perspective alongside a multitude of variables not considered previously.

More specifically, the present study aimed to: 1) examine the relationship between gambling 
and traumatic events that may signal vulnerabilities to disordered gambling; 2) examine 
associations with stressful life events that may signal gambling-related harms (i.e. outcomes 
of gambling problems); and 3) examine attenuations in associations when controlling for 
comorbidities (alcohol, drug use) that may indicate potential ‘third variable’ accounts.  It was 
predicted that gambling problems would be associated with increased levels of trauma and 
stressors, and that the relationships between disordered gambling, trauma and life stressors 
would be attenuated when controlling for comorbidities.

Material & Methods 
2.1 
Sample 
The study is based on data from the ‘Men’s Health and Modern Lifestyles Survey’ collected in 
2009 at Queen Mary, University of London.  The sample comprised 3025 men aged 18-64 
living in England, Wales and Scotland.  
 
A one-stage survey sought to interview a geo-demographically representative sample of the 
male population of the UK through a random location methodological approach.  Random 
location techniques utilise a full selection of geographic areas to be visited by interviewers, 
allied to quota sheets showing exactly whom they must approach and interview within their 
target geography.  This procedure necessitated the use of profiling statistics from the then 
most up-to-date Census (2001).  Within each Government Office Region, all Output Areas 
(OA) (averaging 150 households, and about which all demographic profiling information is 
known) were selected and listed in descending order of CACI (2012) type to place the most 
affluent OAs at the top of the list and the least affluent at the bottom.  This applies a purely 
random variable into the selection of sampling locations. The total number of eligible male 
adults in each OA were then cumulated down the list.  Using a random start and fixed sampling 
interval the required number of OAs were selected.  This process produces a sample of OAs 
with a probability of selection proportionate to size and was designed to produce a 
representative sample by ACORN type.   
 
A total of 250 OAs were selected, with interviewers required to achieve 12 interviews with 
eligible targets at each.  All addresses that lay within selected OAs were potentially available 
for interview.  With OA information cross-referenced against full address lists, interviewers 
were supplied with every single address that was eligible within each OA.  A quota sheet was 
provided for each selected OA, which reflected the actual composition of eligible residents 
according to standard demographic criteria.  These would include socio-demographic 
characteristics such as gender, ethnicity and working status (in addition to age). Interviewers 
  
6 
were required to interview a sample profile that exactly matched that of the eligible OA 
population profile using the then up-to-date ONS population estimates information. This 
ensured that the sample was demographically representative at the micro-level, as well as 
geographically representative of males in the general population. If a participant refused to fill 
out the questionnaire (approximately 23% of all participants approached), or was absent, 
another was located in the area with exactly the same demographic profile (age and social 
class) until the quota was filled.   
 
The statistical reliability of this approach depended both on strictly defining the selection of the 
sampling points, as well as in setting representative quotas at each point, and then 
meticulously meeting these quotas. Compliance with this procedure produced a fully 
representative dataset.  Self-report questionnaires were administered at home, with the 
respondent left to complete the questionnaire in their own time.  The researcher either returned 
later that day, or the next.  Each questionnaire took approximately 45 minutes to complete. 
Participants were given £5 on completion of the questionnaire.

Research Ethics Committee.  For full details and ages and demographic details of subjects

Survey Measures 
2.2.1 Dependent Measures 
Problem/pathological gambling 
Gambling problems were determined by using The South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) 
(Lesieur & Blume, 1987), a 20-item measure based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorder criteria for pathological gambling (APA, 2000).  SOGS scores can range 
from 0-20, and originally the authors distinguished scores of 0 (no problem) from 1-4 (some 
problem), and scores of 5 or more (probable pathological gambling) (Lesieur & Blume, 1987).  
In the current study, in line with later suggestions (e.g. Dubé, Freeston & Ladouceur, 1996; 
Volberg and Steadman, 1988) and to highlight the 'spectrum’ of gambling severity: those with 
scores of 1-2 were given the designation “borderline problem gambler”, those with scores of 
3 and 4 “problem gamblers” and those with scores of 5 or more “probable pathological 
gamblers”. Those with SOGS scores of 0 were combined with the Non-Gambling Group 
(Non/non-problem gamblers) and used as the reference category in all the analyses.  The 
  
7 
SOGS has been found to have satisfactory reliability with coefficient alphas of .69 and .86 in 
the general population and gambling treatment samples, respectively (Stinchfield, 2002).  
 
Trauma and life stressors 
Participants were asked questions about their experience of trauma before the age of 18 
(childhood), specifically whether they had witnessed their parents or carers fighting/ violence 
in the home, had been subjected to physical or sexual abuse/ assault as a child, or had 
received a serious injury (dichotomous yes/ no answers).  Questions were also asked about 
trauma and life stressors after the age of 18 (adulthood), including whether they had 
experienced physical attack resulting in injury, violence at home from a partner or in the 
workplace, or had experienced any other life stressor such as; relationship breakdown, job 
loss, homelessness, money problems or convictions.  Similar questions have been used in 
previous large-scale national surveys (Coid et al., 2006).   
 
2.2.2 Covariates 
Sociodemographic Covariates 
Sociodemographic measures used in the regression models (categorisation in parentheses)  
included; Age (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64); marital status (single, married, separated/ 
divorced/ widowed, couple); education (degree level or above, ‘A-Level’ or equivalent, ‘GCSE’ 
or other, none); annual income (Less than £10,000, £10,000-£19,999, £20,000-£29,999, 
£30,000-£39,999, £40,000+);  area (rural, semi-urban, other urban, inner city); employment 
status (employed, unemployed); and ethnicity (white, minority ethnicity).  
 
Probable alcohol dependence 
The principal instrument to assess alcohol misuse was the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification 
Test (AUDIT) (Babor, Biddle-Higgins, Saunders, & Monteiro, 2001).  The AUDIT consists of 
10 questions, each scored from 0-4 with an overall score ranging from 0 to 40. Scores of 20 
or more indicate alcohol dependence.  The scale has a good median reliability coefficient of 
0.83 (Reinert & Allen, 2007). 
 
Probable drug dependence 
The Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT) was used to identify drug problems 
(Berman, Bergman, Palmstierna, & Schlyter, 2005). The DUDIT consists of an 11-item self-
report questionnaire, which looks at frequency and harms of drug use. A cut-off score of ≥ 25 
indicates drug-dependence. The DUDIT has been found to have good reliability with a 
coefficient alpha of 0.80 (Berman et al., 2005).

2.3 
Data analysis   
The data were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 22.0.  
Binary Logistic regression was used to examine the relationships between gambling and 
psychiatric correlates used in our later analyses (table 1). Here associations were adjusted by 
age, marital status, education, income, area and ethnicity. In table 2, binary logistic regression 
was used to examine relationships and estimate differences in trauma and life stressors per 
gambling group.  Dummy variables indicating the gambling problem categories were specified 
as independent / exogenous variables in these analyses.  Different combinations of covariates 
were entered into the analysis to estimate the independent impact of these characteristics on 
the gambling-trauma relationship.  There were 4 stages to the regression analyses; in the first 
model, all associations were adjusted by age, marital status, education, income, area and 
ethnicity (AOR-1: Adjusted Odds Ratio); in the second model, associations were adjusted for 
demographic covariates and probable alcohol dependence (AOR-2); in the third model, 
associations were adjusted with demographic covariates and probable drug dependence 
(AOR-3); in the fourth model, associations were adjusted with the demographic covariates, 
probable alcohol and drug dependence combined (AOR-4).  A significance level of 5% was 
adopted for all analyses. 
 
3. 
Results 
In our sample of 3025 men, 2418 (79.9%) had taken part in some form of lifetime gambling 
activity. Of the men who gamble, 64.3% were non-problem gamblers (SOGS 0), 21.6% were 
borderline problem gamblers (SOGS 1-2), 6.0% problem gamblers (SOGS 3-4) and 8.1% 
probable pathological gamblers (SOGS 5+).   
 
The relationships between gambling and probable drug and alcohol dependence are 
presented in Table 1.  There was a marked difference between pathological gamblers, 
problem gamblers and non/non-problem gamblers in relation to psychopathology.  Both 
probable pathological gamblers and problem gamblers were significantly more likely to exhibit 
probable alcohol dependence, and probable drug dependence, when compared to non/non-
problem gamblers.  Borderline problem gamblers had a more modest but still statistically 
significant increase in the chance of probable drug and alcohol dependence, relative to 
non/non-problem gamblers.

Table 2 shows associations involving gambling group and experiences of traumatic life events.  
After adjusting for demography, problem/pathological gambling was associated with increased 
odds of having witnessed violence in the home as a child.  Moreover, probable pathological 
gambling (but not problem gambling) was associated with increased odds of physical abuse 
and a serious or life threatening injury in childhood. Borderline problem gamblers exhibited 
increased odds of physical abuse and assault compared to non-problem gamblers.  In 
adulthood, problem/pathological gambling was associated with increased odds of traumatic 
events including injury from physical attack, interpersonal violence in the home, as well as 
violence in the workplace.  Borderline problem gambling was associated with a significantly 
increased odds of being injured compared to non/non-problem gamblers.  
 
Table 2 also shows associations with gambling groups and the broader category of stressful 
life events. Results indicated that probable pathological gambling was associated with 
significantly increased odds of all stressful events including marital difficulties or breakdown, 
job loss, homelessness, serious money problems, and criminal convictions. Problem gambling 
was significantly associated with all such life events except job loss. Borderline problem 
gambling was significantly associated with relationship problems and criminality, compared to 
non/non-problem gamblers, along with serious money problems.   
 
Table 2 
 
Table 3 shows comparable associations involving gambling group, trauma and life stressors, 
while including probable alcohol and drug dependence as covariates. Results indicated that 
associations were generally attenuated with inclusion of covariates, with probable drug 
dependence having largest effects overall.  Witnessing violence in the home as a child and 
domestic violence in home as an adult were the only variables to retain statistical significance 
in all the fully adjusted models in problem and probable pathological gamblers.  Significant 
links remained with violence in the workplace, and being convicted of criminal offence (for 
problem gamblers), and marital problems and money problems (for pathological gamblers) 
after adjustments. Associations retained significance more in probable pathological gamblers 
compared to the other groups.

Discussion 
This study adds to evidence showing a relationship between problem/pathological gambling, 
trauma and stressful life events (e.g. Afifi et al., 2010; Echebura et al., 2011; Hodgins et al., 
2010; Kausch et al., 2006; Petry & Steinberg, 2005; Scherrer et al., 2007).  The study was 
  
10 
unique given the use of a large nationally representative sample of UK men to examine 
relationships involving gambling problems and violence, trauma and life stressors in both 
childhood and adulthood, while also considering roles of probable drug and alcohol 
dependence.  The findings built on previous research in which gambling remained predictive 
of a range of measures of violent behaviour after adjusting for alcohol and drug dependence, 
comorbid mental disorder and impulsivity (Roberts et al., 2016).   
 
The results indicated that male probable pathological gamblers and problem gamblers 
reported higher rates of experiencing trauma in both childhood and adulthood.  Trauma 
included witnessing violence in the home, physical abuse, sexual abuse or IPV in adulthood, 
and violence at work.  Previous studies have also suggested a high incidence of childhood 
victimisation/abuse and adult trauma in disordered gambling groups (Afifi et al., 2010; Korman 
et al., 2008). Although links between trauma and disordered gambling are equivocal, it has 
been postulated that trauma may be causally related to occurrences of disordered gambling, 
with some people using gambling to escape negative emotional states (Grant & Kim, 2002; 
Legerwood & Petry, 2006; MacLaren, Ellery, & Knoll, 2015;  Suomi, Dowling, & Jackson, 2014;  
Wood & Griffiths, 2007).  Victims of family violence and trauma, in particular, may use 
gambling as a coping mechanism (Afifi et al., 2010; Cunningham-Williams, Abdallah, Callahan 
& Cottler, 2007; Korman et al., 2008), and a method of regulating mood (Francis, Dowling 
Jackson, Christensen, & Wardle, 2015).  Some evidence suggests that women in particular 
use gambling in this way (e.g. Echeburua et al., 2011; Weatherly & Cookman, 2014) and the 
present findings suggest that this exposition can be extended to a subgroup of males in a 
nationally representative sample.  The present findings suggest that trauma may precede and 
facilitate the development of disordered gambling as a way to escape either physically or 
emotionally.   
 
Probable pathological gamblers and problem gamblers reported injuries, marital difficulties, 
homelessness, money problems and criminality more often than non/non-problem gamblers.  
Daily stressors have been linked with spontaneous urges to gamble among pathological 
gamblers (Elman, Tschibelu, & Borsook, 2010) and may thus trigger gambling episodes.  
Further, people experiencing gambling problems are often able to identify events and 
stressors that precede increased gambling (Holdsworth, Nuske, & Hing, 2013).  Life stressors 
include legal problems (Hodgins, Peden & Cassidy, 2005), financial difficulties (Kalischuk, 
Nowatzki, Cardwell, Klein, & Solowoniuk, 2006), relationship problems (Downs and Woolrych, 
2010), and housing concerns (Lipmann, Mirabelli, & Rota-Bartelink, 2004). It is also likely that 
occurrences of some stressful life events follow gambling problems may signal further or 
perhaps ongoing likely gambling-related harms and further gambling events.  While previous 
  
11 
studies have referred to certain gambling related harms (e.g. relationship problems, money 
problems, and criminal difficulties) and gambling problems (Dowling, Smith, & Thomas, 2009; 
Ladouceur, Boisvert, Pépin, Loranger, & Sylvain, 1994), few studies have provided evidence 
to support this assumption.  Both significant life events and disordered gambling can be 
interrelated and have been linked to similar issues including legal and financial difficulties, 
relationship problems, and employment-related concerns (Holdsworth et al., 2013). Further 
research is still needed to determine if adult stressors are a trigger or a consequence of 
disordered gambling, although our findings do accentuate the possibility of a self-perpetuating 
cycle.  
 
Probable alcohol and drug dependence was reported by around a third of pathological 
gamblers, consistent with high rates of comorbidity shown previously (Lorains et al., 2011). In 
the present study, the associations involving gambling problems and trauma were generally 
attenuated when adjustments were made for ‘third variable accounts’; alcohol or drug 
dependence.  Although witnessing violence in the home as a child, domestic violence in home 
as an adult, violence in the workplace and some potential “harms” such as being convicted of 
a criminal offence, marital problems and money problems remained significant in some or all 
groups after adjustments.  Afifi et al., (2010) reported similar results, although they did not 
focus exclusively on males and further research is needed to establish directionality and 
possible causal mechanisms. Certain associations with life stressors that were initially 
significant were attenuated entirely when adjustments were made for alcohol / drug use 
problems which suggests that these comorbidities may entirely explain this link (e.g. 
homelessness).   
 
Taken as a whole, this suggests that disordered gambling does not occur in a vacuum, rather 
it is perhaps symptomatic of a more global disturbance in the biopsychosocial functioning of 
some individuals.  This could be interpreted as consistent with the latter of the two pathways 
described by Blaszczynski and Nower (2002) in the Pathways Model, or to some degree the 
model described by Jacobs (1986) which has been supported elsewhere (e.g., Gupta & 
Derevensky, 1998; McCormick et al., 2012).  It would seem likely that there is a more 
fundamental process underlying this, with the effects of significant trauma being important.  
Developing understanding of complex gene-environment interactions resulting in an increased 
or differential susceptibility to environmental stressors (e.g., Belsky & Pluess, 2009; Monroe 
& Simmons, 1991; Zuckerman, 1999) is likely to be a significant focus of future research when 
looking at ways to prevent harm and identifying where to place greater resources at population 
level.  In the interim, more research is required examining specific pathways and risk factors 
contributing to disordered gambling, and addictive behaviours more generally.  It is clear that 
  
12 
treatments should be developed which are specific for problem gamblers with distinct 
vulnerabilities; whether these are a history of trauma, comorbid substance abuse or where 
gambling is motivated by escape or used as a maladaptive coping strategy to deal with 
psychological difficulties (Legerwood & Petry, 2006; McCormick, Delfabbro, & Denson, 2012; 
Wood & Griffiths, 2007). 
 
Our survey was not without limitations and these should be considered when interpreting the 
findings.  They have been described elsewhere (Roberts et al., 2016) and include the use of 
retrospective, cross-sectional and self-report data and the SOGS as a population tool (Lesieur 
and Blume, 1987).  The data were collected in 2009 and are now 7 years old and results may 
not be relevant to other countries/ cultures. Violence was assessed by self-report and did not 
include corroborative data on specific arrests and/or convictions.   The SOGS (Lesieur & 
Blume, 1987) was designed as a clinical scale, and despite being widely used in population 
surveys (e.g. Volberg & Steadman 1988), there are other scales such as the Problem 
Gambling Severity Index (Ferris & Wynne, 2001) that were specifically designed for population 
level work.  Researchers have used a variety of scales, and caution is required when directly 
comparing prevalence rates.  Although a relationship between trauma, life stressors and 
disordered gambling is evident, the study cannot address whether adversity is the direct cause 
of disordered gambling.  Longitudinal data may be required to fully comprehend the 
mechanisms underlying this link.   
 
5. 
Conclusions 
The findings add support to previous literature that shows a link between trauma, life stressors 
and disordered gambling.  The study was unique and addressed a gap in the literature by 
using a nationally representative sample of UK men.  Furthermore, although stressful life 
events can be subsumed by notions of gambling-related harms, there are few rigorous studies 
that have demonstrated these links empirically.  Thus, our findings are important in terms of 
demonstrating the public health impact and context of gambling problems.  Understanding the 
developmental precursors to disordered gambling; specifically, the relationship between 
disordered gambling and trauma, will assist in the development of more effective early 
intervention and treatment initiatives; in the latter, an improved understanding would impact 
on case conceptualisation and treatment complexity. Public health initiatives could also 
include information about and support of adaptive coping strategies to those exposed to early 
trauma, especially violence and those with comorbid substance and gambling problems due 
to increased vulnerability.  Moreover, disordered gambling precursors and the harms of 
gambling (i.e. life stressors) may signal further clinical needs and an improved knowledge of 
these may help the identification of those who may be at risk for stress-related relapse or 
  
13 
escalation.  The evidence supports a need for disordered gambling treatment services to 
undertake routine screening for alcohol, drugs, IPV and traumatic life events and to tailor 
treatment that specifically target the effects of stress for clients who present with such a cluster 
of issues. There is also a need for other services as such as drug and alcohol and other mental 
health services to routinely screen for gambling, trauma and adverse life events.
