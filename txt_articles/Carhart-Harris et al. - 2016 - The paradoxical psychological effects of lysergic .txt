Background. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a potent serotonergic hallucinogen or psychedelic that modulates con-
sciousness in a marked and novel way. This study sought to examine the acute and mid-term psychological effects of
LSD in a controlled study.
Method. A total of 20 healthy volunteers participated in this within-subjects study. Participants received LSD (75 µg,
intravenously) on one occasion and placebo (saline, intravenously) on another, in a balanced order, with at least 2
weeks separating sessions. Acute subjective effects were measured using the Altered States of Consciousness question-
naire and the Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI). A measure of optimism (the Revised Life Orientation Test), the
Revised NEO Personality Inventory, and the Peter’s Delusions Inventory were issued at baseline and 2 weeks after
each session.
Results. LSD produced robust psychological effects; including heightened mood but also high scores on the PSI, an
index of psychosis-like symptoms. Increased optimism and trait openness were observed 2 weeks after LSD (and not
placebo) and there were no changes in delusional thinking.
Conclusions. The present findings reinforce the view that psychedelics elicit psychosis-like symptoms acutely yet im-
prove psychological wellbeing in the mid to long term. It is proposed that acute alterations in mood are secondary to
a more fundamental modulation in the quality of cognition, and that increased cognitive flexibility subsequent to sero-
tonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) stimulation promotes emotional lability during intoxication and leaves a residue of ‘loo-
sened cognition’ in the mid to long term that is conducive to improved psychological wellbeing.

Introduction
Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a potent serotoner-
gic hallucinogen or ‘psychedelic’ that alters conscious-
ness in a marked and unusual way. The drug was first
intentionally consumed by the Swiss chemist Albert
Hofmann in 1943 in a self-experiment in which he
ingested 250 µg (a high dose) in his laboratory before
travelling home. In a detailed report of his experience,
written a few days later, Hofmann describes an ini-
tially unpleasant experience, characterized by altered
perception, fear and paranoia: his next-door neighbour
transformed into a ‘malevolent, insidious witch with a
coloured mask’, he sensed a ‘disintegration of the outer
world’, a ‘dissolution of [his] ego’ and was ‘seized by a
dreadful fear of going insane’ (Hofmann, 1980).
From this account, it would be reasonable to suspect
that Dr Hofmann was negatively affected by this ex-
perience but his description of his mental state the
next day suggests otherwise: ‘I then slept, to awake
the next morning with a clear head. . . A sensation of
wellbeing and renewed life flowed through me.
Breakfast tasted delicious and gave me extraordinary
pleasure. When I later walked out into the garden, in
which the sun shone now after a spring rain, every-
thing glistened and sparkled in a fresh light. The
world was as if newly created.’(Hofmann, 1980)
When LSD was first distributed by Sandoz pharma-
ceuticals in 1948, product guidelines stipulated two
main applications: (1) analytical psychotherapy and
(2) experimental studies on psychoses. The rationale
for the former was that LSD could ‘elicit [the] release
of repressed material and provide mental relaxation
for anxiety and obsessional neuroses’, and, for the

 latter, that it could model aspects of psychosis and fa-
cilitate an understanding of its nature and pathogen-
esis (Hofmann, 1980). These two properties formed
the basis of a large number of research projects with
LSD in the 1950s and 1960s. However, the apparent
paradox by which the same compound can be both a
model of, and yet a treatment for, psychopathology
has never been properly addressed.
In the early years of research with LSD, its remark-
able potency (LSD is psychoactive in doses of 25 µg
or lower; Hintzen & Passie, 2010) led psychiatrists to
speculate
about
the
existence
of
an
endogenous
LSD-like ‘schizotoxin’ in the brains of patients with
schizophrenia (Osmond & Smythies, 1952). In subse-
quent years, however, focus shifted more onto thera-
peutic
applications,
such
as
treating
alcohol
dependence, mood disorders and anxiety related to
dying. Human research with LSD was brought to a
halt in the late 1960s due to political pressure, moti-
vated in part by reports of adverse psychological reac-
tions
among people using the drug improperly.
Ironically, however, at the same time, reports of thera-
peutic success in the treatment of various psychiatric
disorders were beginning to amount (Grinspoon &
Bakalar, 1979). In the last 18 months, five new reports
on clinical research with LSD have appeared in the
scientific press (Carhart-Harris et al. 2014a; Gasser
et al. 2014; Schmid et al. 2014; Dolder et al. 2015;
Kaelen et al. 2015), one of which focused on the
drug’s therapeutic effects (Gasser et al. 2014) and, an-
other, its psychotomimetic effects (Schmid et al. 2014).
Clinical research with psychedelics is currently
undergoing a major revival and modern studies are
documenting the same paradoxical properties that
were historically described with LSD. For example, in
a controlled study in healthy volunteers, high-dose
psilocybin produced strong or extreme fear in 30% of
healthy volunteers and yet 80% reported improve-
ments in wellbeing after the experience, with none
reporting
any
decreases
(Griffiths
et
al.
2006).
Remarkably, in follow-up of the same sample, 65%
reported improved wellbeing 14 months after their
(single) psilocybin experience (Griffiths et al. 2008)
and significant increases in the personality trait open-
ness were also evident (MacLean et al. 2011). These
finding in healthy volunteers are supplemented by an
increasing number of patient studies. Clinical improve-
ments have been observed with psilocybin-assisted
psychotherapy for the treatment of tobacco (Johnson
et al. 2014) and alcohol addiction (Bogenschutz et al.
2015), obsessive–compulsive disorder (Moreno et al.
2006) and anxiety related to dying (Grob et al. 2011).
Many of these reports mention some psychological dis-
comfort during the acute experience; yet, the thera-
peutic benefits have been impressive and enduring.
Case reports of persistent psychological problems
apparently precipitated by a psychedelic have consid-
erable potential to excite alarm (Reich & Hepps,
1972). However, such cases are rare and largely
restricted to recreational use. Evidence does not sup-
port the view that psychedelics are harmful to mental
health (Hendricks et al. 2015). Indeed, to the contrary,
two recent population studies found decreased rates
of suicidality and psychological distress among per-
sons
reporting
previous
use
of
psychedelics
(Hendricks et al. 2015) and no evidence of any
increased rates of mental health problems (Krebs &
Johansen, 2013). Similarly, large meta-analyses of con-
trolled research have found that cases of mental health
complications following exposure to a psychedelic are
extremely rare (i.e. <0.1%), even in vulnerable popula-
tions (i.e. <0.2%), and are rarer still if volunteers are
properly screened (Cohen & Ditman, 1962; Studerus
et al. 2011).
The main aim of the present study was to investigate
the acute and ‘mid-term’ (i.e. 2 weeks after the acute
experience) psychological effects of LSD in a placebo-
controlled study in healthy volunteers. Validated
measures of personality, optimism and psychotic
symptoms were collected at baseline and 2 weeks
post-LSD/placebo and measures of mood, cognition
and psychotomimetic states were collected at the end
of each dosing day. It was predicted that LSD would
induce emotional lability and psychosis-like symptoms
acutely but increase psychological wellbeing and open-
ness in the longer term.
Method
Experimental design
This was a placebo-controlled, within-subjects/cross-
over study, with a balanced-order design. A total of
20 healthy volunteers were recruited to the study via
word of mouth. The study received a favourable opin-
ion from NRES Committee London – West London
and was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical
Practice
guidelines,
NHS
Research
Governance
Framework and complied with the ethical standards
of the declaration of Helsinki (1975, revised 2008).
Imperial College London sponsored the research and
a Home Office license was obtained for research with
schedule one drugs. All volunteers were sent a study
information sheet and asked to read it before their
screening visit.
Volunteers made three study visits: screening, dos-
ing session 1 and dosing session 2. Dosing sessions
were separated by at least 2 weeks in every case and
the order of receipt of LSD was balanced, i.e. half of
the volunteers received LSD in dosing session 1 and

 half in dosing session 2. Volunteers were blind to the
dosing order but the research team was not. Dosing
order was determined sequentially so that all odd-
numbered volunteers (i.e. S1 was the first volunteer
recruited and S20 was the last) received LSD in dosing
session 1, whereas all even-numbered volunteers
received it in dosing session 2. Subjective ratings
were completed electronically and remotely soon
after screening (baseline) and 2 weeks after a dosing
session
and
sent
to
the
researchers
via
email.
Volunteers were instructed to complete the question-
naires in a quiet space without rushing. Two question-
naires pertaining to the acute drug experience were
completed electronically within the research centre at
the close of dosing days.
Screening
Prior to study enrolment, volunteers attended a screen-
ing visit at the Imperial Clinical Research Facility
(ICRF)
at
the
Hammersmith
Hospital
in
West
London. The study design, procedures and psycho-
logical effects of LSD were explained and signed
informed consent taken. Key exclusion criteria were:
<21 years of age, personal history of diagnosed psychi-
atric illness, immediate family history of a psychotic
disorder, an absence of previous experience with a
classic psychedelic drug (e.g. LSD, mescaline, psilo-
cybin/magic mushrooms or dimethyltryptamine/aya-
huasca), pregnancy, problematic alcohol use (assessed
via psychiatric interview and reported weekly units),
or a medically significant condition rendering the vol-
unteer unsuitable for the study. The decision to recruit
only individuals with prior experience with psychede-
lics was motivated by safety considerations, i.e. to min-
imize the risk of an adverse response to the drug.
Screening involved routine blood tests, electrocardio-
gram, heart rate, blood pressure and a brief neurologic-
al examination. All enrolled participants were deemed
physically and mentally healthy by the study psych-
iatrist, and none had histories of drug or alcohol de-
pendence
or
diagnosed
psychiatric
disorder.
Volunteers were asked to remain abstinent from alco-
hol the evening before a dosing day and to refrain
from using other recreational drugs for the duration
of the study.
Study procedures
Participants were asked to arrive at the study centre
(Cardiff University’s Brain Research Imaging Centre,
CUBRIC) at a specific time at or before 09.00 hours.
A urine test for drugs of abuse and pregnancy
(where relevant) was carried out. Participants were
re-briefed about the procedures for the day and any re-
cent drug and alcohol use was documented. The study
physician inserted a cannula into a vein in the antecu-
bital fossa in preparation for intravenous (i.v.) dosing
and the volunteer was encouraged to relax prior to
drug/placebo administration. The dose of LSD was
75 µg (by mouth; p.o.) in 10 ml saline. Previous re-
search has found this dose to produce robust psycho-
logical
effects
that
are
generally
well
tolerated
(Carhart-Harris et al. 2014a). Placebo was 10 ml saline
(i.v.). Both solutions were infused over 2 min.
After dosing, volunteers completed a functional neu-
roimaging protocol. This aspect of the study will be
covered in detail in separate publications. In brief, sub-
jects spent a period habituating to a scanner environ-
ment in a mock magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scanner before entering a real MRI scanner (1 h post-
dosing). The MRI scanning session lasted for 1 h after
which a structured interview was performed and
some ratings completed. Participants entered a magne-
toencephalography
(MEG)
scanner
approximately
3.5 h post-dosing. MEG scanning lasted for just over
1 h. Participants were then interviewed and completed
a battery of cognitive and behavioural tests (these will
be detailed in a separate publication). Tasks were com-
pleted 6–7 h post-dosing.
The subjective effects of LSD were detected approxi-
mately 10 min post-infusion, peaked approximately
120 min post-infusion, and subsided to a negligible
level approximately 7–8 h post-infusion. Participants
were discharged by the study physician when they
were
considered
to
be
functioning
normally.
Volunteers were either picked up by a friend or part-
ner, ordered a taxi, or accompanied home by the re-
search team as far as was feasible. Volunteers were
asked to contact a researcher via telephone or text mes-
sage once they had arrived home safely. A study
psychiatrist was present for the duration of each dos-
ing session and one researcher was allocated to each
participant to assist them throughout the day. For
each participant, the same researcher was present for
both dosing days.
Main outcomes and measures
Acute outcomes
Participants completed two questionnaires at the end
of each study day before being discharged by the
study physician. These questionnaires enquired about
different aspects of the subjective experience. The
first was the Altered States of Consciousness question-
naire (ASC), a well validated and widely used tool for
defining different altered states of consciousness that
has been usefully revised in recent years (Studerus
et al. 2010) and the second was the Psychotomimetic
States Inventory (PSI), a tool developed to probe the
psychotomimetic effects of different drugs (Mason

 et al. 2008). Participants were asked to complete the
questionnaires with reference to the peak subjective
effects of LSD (i.e. when the effects were most intense)
or with reference to how they generally felt throughout
the day – e.g. if they did not notice any effects.
Mid-term outcomes
Mid-term outcomes were completed 2 weeks after each
dosing session (as well as at baseline) and these
included: the Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R;
Glaesmer et al. 2012), the Revised NEO Personality
Inventory (NEO PI-R; Costa & McCrae, 1995) and
Peters’ Delusions Inventory (PDI; Peters et al. 1999).
The LOT-R was chosen as it is a well-validated meas-
ure of trait or dispositional optimism (Scheier et al.
1994), the NEO PI-R was chosen as it is well-validated
and previous research has shown its sensitivity to the
enduring
effects
of
psychedelics
(MacLean et
al.
2011), and the PDI was chosen as it is a well-validated
measure of delusional thinking that has shown to be
sensitive to psychotic-like symptoms in the general
population (Peters et al. 1999).
Additional measures
Additional
questionnaires
completed
at
baseline
included the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck
et
al.
1961),
the
Quick
Inventory
of
Depressive
Symptomatology (QIDS; Rush et al. 2003), the State–
Trait
Anxiety
Inventory
(STAI;
Hodgues
&
Spielberger, 1969), the Ruminative Response Scale
(RRS; Roelofs et al. 2006), the Dysfunctional Attitudes
Scale (DAS; Floyd et al. 2004) and the modified version
of the Tellegen Absorption Scale (MODTAS; Tellegen
& Atkinson, 1974).
Data analysis
Repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs)
were used to test between-condition differences in
the ASC, PSI and PDI, which have multiple factors.
However, since a strong prior hypothesis was held
that the personality trait ‘openness’ would be signifi-
cantly increased post-LSD (MacLean et al. 2011), this
was analysed using a paired t test rather than an
ANOVA. The remaining four personality dimensions
in the NEO PI-R were analysed using paired t tests
with Bonferonni correction for multiple comparisons.
A paired t test was used to analyse changes in the
LOT-R, as this has only one dimension. To test for
order confounds in relation to primary outcomes,
order was included as a variable in significant tests,
and to further test for the influence of placebo/partici-
pation, baseline versus 2 weeks post-placebo differ-
ences in outcomes were tested for those who received
placebo in their first dosing session (potential carry-
over effects of LSD precludes the inclusion of those
who received placebo in their second dosing session).
Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were calculated for primary
outcomes. For correlational analyses, Pearson product-
moment coefficients were calculated and two-tailed
hypotheses tested. The problem of multiple compari-
sons was accounted for by Bonferonni correction.
Results
Participants
A total of 20 healthy volunteers participated in the
study (four females, mean age = 30.9, S.D. = 7.8, range
= 22–47 years). All had at least one previous experience
with a classic psychedelic drug (mean estimated LSD
uses = 14, S.D. = 17.8, range = 0–70) but not within 14
days of the first dosing session (mean last use of
LSD = 899.3,
S.D. = 1363,
range = 14–5400
days).
Self-estimates of other drug use were as follows:
mean weekly alcohol units = 10.3 (S.D. = 9); mean num-
ber of daily cigarettes = 0.3 (S.D. = 1.1, range = 0–5);
mean number of cannabis uses = 705 (S.D. = 639, range
= 30–2000);
mean
number
of
3,4-methylenedioxy-
methamphetamine (MDMA) uses = 27 (S.D. = 24, range
= 2–100); mean number of psilocybin/magic mushroom
uses = 9.4 (S.D. = 7.8, range = 1–35); mean number of
ketamine
uses = 3.6
(S.D. = 5,
range = 0–20);
mean
number of cocaine uses = 9.6 (S.D. = 9.4, range = 0–30).
Other mean baseline scores were as follows: BDI = 0.6
(S.D. = 0.9, range = 0–3); QIDS = 4.2 (S.D. = 3.1, range = 0–
10); DAS = 105.5 (S.D. = 23, range = 55–146); RRS = 35.4
(S.D. = 7.9, range = 24–52); STAI = 29.2 (S.D. = 4.6, range
= 20–38); MODTAS = 58.3 (S.D. = 19.8, range = 19–89).
Acute subjective effects of LSD
A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant
main effect of drug (F1,19 = 82.6, p < 0.001) and a signifi-
cant drug × ASC interaction (F1,19 = 10.3, p < 0.001).
Post-hoc t tests revealed that all 11 dimensions or fac-
tors of the ASC were rated significantly higher after
LSD than placebo (p < 0.01). Mean scores for each fac-
tor are displayed in the radar chart in Fig. 1. It is not-
able
that
although
the
LSD
experience
was
dominated by changes in visual perception (i.e. elem-
entary imagery, complex imagery and audio-visual
synaesthesia), the factor ‘blissful state’ was markedly
elevated under the drug (+0.37, S.D. = 0.28, Cohen’s d
= 1.65). Although still significantly increased, the factor
‘anxiety’ was the least elevated under LSD (+0.15, S.D.
= 0.2, Cohen’s d = 1.03). These results indicate a marked
increase in emotional arousal and lability under LSD
but with a distinct bias towards positive affect.
Reinforcing this, a t test revealed that increases in

 ‘blissful state’ under LSD were significantly greater
than increases in ‘anxiety’ [t = −3.7, degrees of freedom
(df) = 19, p < 0.01, Cohen’s d = 0.91].
A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant
main effect of condition on the PSI (F1,19 = 65.19, p <
0.001) and a significant condition × PSI interaction
(F5,95 = 35.2, p < 0.001). Mean scores for each factor of
the PSI are shown in the bar chart in Fig. 2. Post-hoc t
tests revealed that all factors, except ‘anhedonia’,
were significantly increased under the drug (p < 0.01).
The most marked effect was on ‘cognitive disorganiza-
tion’ (Cohen’s d = 2.37) which is related to thought dis-
order in psychosis, but other highly characteristic
aspects of psychosis such as ‘delusional thinking’
(Cohen’s d = 1.63) and ‘paranoia’ (Cohen’s d = 0.83)
were also markedly increased under the drug.
Mid-term subjective effects of LSD
Optimism was significantly increased 2 weeks after
LSD (t = 2.91, df = 18, p = 0.005, Cohen’s d = 0.56), as
was trait openness (t = 1.95, df = 19, p = 0.03, Cohen’s
d = 0.16) (Fig. 3), and there were no such changes in
optimism or personality post-placebo. In exploratory
t tests, there was a trend towards an increase in trait
agreeableness
post-LSD
(t = 2.2,
df = 19,
p = 0.038,
Cohen’s
d = 0.21);
however,
this
did
not
survive
correction for multiple comparisons [corrected p =
0.15].
Repeated-measures ANOVA found no change in de-
lusional thinking (PDI scores) 2 weeks after LSD (p >
0.05). In fact, exploratory t tests suggested a trend to-
wards less distress (t = 1.92, df = 19, p = 0.068) and pre-
occupation with ‘delusional thoughts’ (t = 1.92, df =
19, p = 0.07) but these trends were not significant,
even
before
correction
for
multiple
comparisons.
There were no changes in PDI scores post-placebo.
Predictors of the mid-term effects of LSD
Regarding baseline predictors of the mid-term effects
of LSD, focus was placed on personality (as measured
by the NEO PI-R), depression (measured by the QIDS)
and anxiety (measured by the STAI). A negative correl-
ation was found between baseline agreeableness and
increases in optimism post-LSD (r = −0.56, r2 = 0.31, p
= 0.014) and positive correlations were found between
baseline depression (r = 0.53, r2 = 0.28, p = 0.024) and
anxiety (r = 0.49, r2 = 0.24, p = 0.04) and the post-LSD
increases in openness. However, none of these sur-
vived correction for multiple comparisons (revised p
= 0.05/7 = 0.007).
Regarding acute predictors of the mid-term effects of
LSD, there was a negative correlation between acute
anxiety (ASC) and post-LSD increases in optimism (r
= −0.47, r2 = 0.22, n = 19, p = 0.04) and positive correla-
tions between impaired/disorganized cognition scores
on the ASC and PSI and post-LSD increases in open-
ness (ASC: r = 0.44, r2 = 0.2, n = 20, p = 0.049; PSI: r =
0.52, r2 = 0.26, n = 20, p = 0.019) but these correlations
also failed to survive correction for multiple compari-
sons (revised p = 0.5/17 = 0.003).
Discussion
The primary aim of this study was to investigate the
acute and mid-term subjective effects of LSD in a con-
trolled study in order to advance our understanding of
its psychological effects. It was hypothesized that LSD
would increase emotional lability and psychosis-like
symptoms
acutely,
and
increase
optimism

 openness 2 weeks later, and these hypotheses were
supported by the data.
Focusing first on LSD’s acute effects, scores on the
PSI reinforce the view that LSD is a potent psychoto-
mimetic. Previous studies have examined PSI scores
after sleep deprivation (Petrovsky et al. 2014), dream-
ing (Mason & Wakerley, 2012), cannabis (Mason et al.
2008), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (Stokes et al. 2009)
and
ketamine
intoxication
(Mason
et
al.
2008).
Although both dreaming and sleep deprivation ele-
vated subscales of the PSI, only the aforementioned
drugs
produced
appreciable
psychosis-like
symp-
toms – and still not to the same extent as LSD in the
present study. For example, mean total scores on the
PSI were 24 (S.D. = 10.9) post-ketamine infusion (150
mg/ml plasma), 15.9 (S.D. = 11) post-THC (10 mg, p.o.)
and 33.3 (S.D. = 19.5) post-cannabis use (smoked, quan-
tity unknown), whereas the mean total PSI score in the
present study was 45.8 (S.D. = 21). To our knowledge,
only
cannabis
in
highly
schizotypal
individuals
(Mason et al. 2009) has produced PSI scores of an
equivalent magnitude to those seen here with LSD.
More generally, relatively strong subjective effects
were produced by the present dose of LSD (i.e. 75
µg, i.v.) as indexed by the ASC. In previous studies,
psilocybin

mg/kg, p.o.) and ketamine (6–12 µg/kg per min, i.v.)
produced effects of a lower magnitude than those
seen here (Studerus et al. 2010) but in a recent study
with 200 µg LSD (p.o.), ASC scores were of a similar
magnitude to those observed here (Schmid et al. 2014).
With the PSI results in mind, it is worth briefly dis-
cussing the relative merits of different drug models of
psychosis. Ketamine is often described as an especially
meritorious model of psychosis because it can induce
both positive and negative symptoms (Krystal et al.
1994). However, the premise that negative symptoms
can be modelled by an acute drug state is questionable
(Carhart-Harris et al. 2013). For example, it has been
argued that negative symptoms are
non-specific
for psychosis (i.e. they are also prevalent in depres-
sion; Kaiser et al. 2011; Carhart-Harris et al. 2013).
Positive symptoms are specific for psychosis, but
comparison studies have suggested that these are
better modelled by classic psychedelics than ketamine
(Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al. 2005; Carhart-Harris et al.
2013). Others have shown that THC is a particularly
potent
inducer
of
positive
psychotic
symptoms
(Morrison et al. 2009). Thus, future studies might
compare the psychotomimetic properties of THC,
ketamine and a classic psychedelic in a controlled,
cross-over design to systematically assess the relative
value of these different models.
Based on the PSI results, one might infer that parti-
cipants’ acute LSD experiences were dominated by un-
pleasant psychosis-like phenomena; however, this was
not the case. Some volunteers did show frank psychot-
ic phenomena during their LSD experiences (e.g. para-
noid and delusional thinking) but at the group level,
positive mood was more common. For example, scores
on the (positively valenced) ‘blissful experience’ di-
mension of the ASC were significantly higher than
scores on the (negatively valenced) ‘anxiety’ dimen-
sion. Consistent with the view that LSD is more likely
to produce positive than negative mood, a separate
study
with
LSD
(200 µg,
p.o.)
reported

 positive
mood effects, described as
‘MDMA-like’
(Schmid et al. 2014); an important caveat, however, is
that both the Schmid et al. study and the present one
recruited volunteers with previous experience with
psychedelics. Thus, positive prior experiences and
positive
regard
towards
LSD
may
have
biased
outcomes.
The
findings that optimism and openness
are
increased 2 weeks after LSD are consistent with previ-
ous findings (Griffiths et al. 2006, 2008; MacLean et al.
2011), suggesting that improved psychological well-
being and increased openness are relatively reliable
mid- to long-term effects of psychedelics. That there
were no increases in psychotic symptomatology at
the 2 week end point is also consistent with reports
of preserved or even improved mental health among
populations of people that have used psychedelic
drugs (Bouso et al. 2012; Krebs & Johansen, 2013;
Hendricks et al. 2015). These results are also consistent
with previous findings that psychedelics can be useful
in treating certain psychiatric disorders (Moreno et al.
2006; Grob et al. 2011; Gasser et al. 2014; Johnson
et al. 2014; Bogenschutz et al. 2015) as well as the notion
that they may have therapeutic potential in the treat-
ment
of
mood
disorders
such
as
depression
(Carhart-Harris et al. 2014b). High dispositional opti-
mism is associated with a range of positive health
and socio-economic outcomes (Carver & Scheier,
2014); thus, the increases in optimism observed here
may be treated as further evidence of the therapeutic
potential of psychedelic drugs.
A limitation of the present study was the relatively
short duration of the follow-up period (i.e. 2 weeks);
however, longer-term follow-up is planned and 2
weeks is still relevant when considering potential
therapeutic applications (Zarate et al. 2006). Another
limitation is the single-blind design; however, the clas-
sic double-blind model can feel contrived in the
context of controlled studies with psychoactive com-
pounds such as LSD, since the blind is almost univer-
sally ineffective. A single-blind design allowed us to
introduce some uncertainty, however, and so was con-
sidered better than an entirely open-label design. The
inclusion of an ‘active placebo’ condition might im-
prove the ineffectiveness of the blind in studies with
psychedelics; however, an inert placebo was required
in the present study in order to provide a valid base-
line for the neuroimaging contrasts. Related to this, a
final limitation is that the LSD and placebo sessions
involved MRI and MEG scans that each lasted for
over 60 min. Brain imaging environments can be
demanding for some individuals, particularly under
the influence of psychedelics (Studerus et al. 2011).
Individuals are known to be especially sensitive to
the environment in which they experience the effects
of a psychedelic (Johnson et al. 2008), and so the
drug plus scanner combination may have contributed
to the especially high PSI scores observed here with
LSD.
With these caveats entered, it is important to attempt
an explanation of how LSD can be both acutely psych-
otomimetic and yet psychologically beneficial in the
mid to long term, and insights from neurobiology
may be helpful in this regard. There is a consensus
that serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) agonism is cen-
tral to the psychopharmacology of psychedelics, e.g.
affinity for the 5-HT2AR correlates strongly with their
potencies (Glennon et al. 1984), and pre-treatment
with

5-HT2AR
antagonist

 (Vollenweider et al. 1998). The principal psychological
purpose or function of the 5-HT2AR is poorly under-
stood; however, it is known that 5-HT2AR stimulation
promotes certain aspects of learning (Harvey, 2003;
Harvey et al. 2004; Romano et al. 2010) and cognition
(King et al. 1972; Williams et al. 2002). Specifically,
5-HT2AR stimulation enhances the flexibility of cogni-
tion (Boulougouris et al. 2008), which may be related
to reports of enhanced imagination (Carhart-Harris
et al. 2014a) and creative thinking (Frecska et al. 2012)
with psychedelics. Interestingly, an association has
been found between positive mood and flexible, cre-
ative thinking (Hirt et al. 2008; Lin et al. 2014) and
this may explain why both are associated with psyche-
delics. Indeed, the positive mood effects of psilocybin
(a direct 5-HT2AR agonist) and MDMA (a potent sero-
tonin ‘releaser’) are significantly attenuated by pre-
treatment with the 5-HT2AR antagonist ketanserin
(Kometer et al. 2012; Van Wel et al. 2012).
Psychedelics also transiently impair certain aspects
of cognition, however, such as the ability to focus
and concentrate (Umbricht et al. 2003; Vollenweider
et al. 2007), which is consistent with the high ratings
of impaired cognition in the present study (Figs. 1
and 2). It is also important to acknowledge that
while 5-HT2AR antagonism attenuates the positive
mood effects of psilocybin (and MDMA), it also
attenuates the positive psychotic symptoms that can
be produced by the drug (Carter et al. 2007) and
5-HT2AR agonism has been linked with anxiety-related
behaviours in rodents (Weisstaub et al. 2006).
Thus, 5-HT2AR stimulation has been associated with
both positive and negative facets of the acute psyche-
delic state (i.e. positive mood but also anxiety and
psychotic symptoms), so how can we reconcile these
things with each other? Is there a more fundamental
action of psychedelics that can explain both effects?
As reported above, 5-HT2AR stimulation has been
associated with enhanced cognitive flexibility, and
inspired by recent neuroimaging findings (Carhart-
Harris et al. 2012; Muthukumaraswamy et al. 2013;
Petri et al. 2014; Roseman et al. 2014; Tagliazucchi
et al. 2014), the psychedelic state has been characterized
as an ‘entropic’ state in which the mind/brain operates
outside of its normal, optimal level of order, in a realm
of relative disorder (Carhart-Harris et al. 2014b). It may
be that what underlies both facets of the psychedelic
state and can resolve the ‘valence paradox’ therefore,
is this principle of increased cognitive entropy (see
Fig. 4). Accordingly, we predict that disordered or en-
tropic cognition is a more fundamental characteristic of
the psychedelic state than either positive or negative
mood. This hypothesis could be tested by carrying
out a principal components analysis of the ASC data;
Fig. 4. Action of psychedelics on the mind and brain: This empirically informed model illustrates the hypothesized
relationship between three different neurobiological or physiological states and their psychological counterparts. Specifically,
it is predicted that deficient serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) stimulation has a stultifying influence on cognition, promoting
pessimism, neuroticism and rigid thinking (phase 1). Informed by neuroimaging studies with psychedelics (Carhart-Harris
et al. 2014b), 5-HT2AR stimulation is associated with unconstrained brain network dynamics and the characteristic ‘entropic’
quality of cognition in the psychedelic state (phase 2). Finally, it is hypothesized that an acute ‘onslaught’ or ‘blast’ of
5-HT2AR stimulation, via the action of a psychedelic, has a residual influence on brain network dynamics and associated
cognition (phase 3). 5-HT2AR stimulation is described as having a ‘loosening’ or ‘lubricating’ influence on cognition and this
is hypothesized to be conducive to improved psychological wellbeing. * The long-term effects of psychedelics on brain
network dynamics have yet to be formally investigated.

 we would predict that valence non-specific items and
particularly those related to ‘entropic cognition’ (such
as loss of self/ego, loss of ego-boundaries, altered
meaning and muddled thinking) would load more
heavily
onto
the
first
principal
component
than
valence-specific items (such as feeling euphoric or
sad) – e.g. see Lebedev et al. (2015). Acute entropic pro-
cesses may also be useful predictors of the mid/long-
terms effects of psychedelics, and the (trend-level) rela-
tionship between impaired/disordered cognition and
subsequent increases in trait openness might be sug-
gestive of such an association.
Before concluding, it is worth considering one final
important matter. The discussion so far has focused
mainly on the paradoxical acute psychological effects
of psychedelics. However, as the present results have
demonstrated, the acute effects of psychedelics can be
quite different to their longer-term effects, and it is ar-
guably the latter that are more clinically relevant.
Previous studies have shown that trait characteristics,
such as personality and outlook, can be significantly
altered by psychedelics (Griffiths et al. 2008; MacLean
et al. 2011). Moreover, associations have been found be-
tween certain psychological traits and the 5-HT2AR
(Turecki et al. 1999; Meyer et al. 2003; Ott et al. 2005;
Bhagwagar
et
al.
2006;
Frokjaer
et
al.
2008).
Specifically, deficient 5-HT2AR stimulation has been
linked with depression-related behaviours such as sui-
cide (Turecki et al. 1999), dysfunctional or excessively
pessimistic attitudes (Meyer et al. 2003; Bhagwagar
et al. 2006) and neuroticism (Frokjaer et al. 2008). In
this
context,
increased
psychological
wellbeing
(Griffiths et al. 2008), openness (MacLean et al. 2011),
decreased suicidality (Hendricks et al. 2015) and now
increased optimism after a ‘blast’ of 5-HT2AR stimula-
tion may begin to make functional sense. We predict
that deficient 5-HT2AR stimulation causes cognition
to ‘stultify’, whereas 5-HT2AR stimulation loosens cog-
nition and associated brain dynamics, serving as a
metaphorical ‘lubricant’ for the mind and brain. We
predict that this loosening effect persists beyond the
acute intoxication phase and can potentially explain
the mid- to long-term psychological effects of psyche-
delics. Recent reports of enduring brain changes
with 5-HT2AR stimulation and psychedelic drug-use
(Bouso et al. 2015), as well as speculations on the func-
tion of serotonin in the brain (Branchi, 2011), may her-
ald
the
beginnings
of an
understanding
of
this
important matter. We intend to detail the acute brain
effects of LSD in forthcoming neuroimaging papers
and to investigate the long-term psychological and
brain effects of psychedelics in future studies.
In conclusion, this study sought to investigate the
paradoxical psychological effects of LSD in a con-
trolled study in healthy volunteers. LSD produced
robust acute psychological effects that were character-
ized by psychosis-like symptoms but also positive
mood. Mid-term effects included significant increases
in optimism and the personality trait openness and
no increases in delusional thinking. A mechanistic ex-
planation for these findings was proposed based on
the ‘entropic brain’ hypothesis (Carhart-Harris et al.
2014b).
