Abstract
Accurate estimation of food portion size is critical in dietary studies. Hands are potentially useful as portion size estimation aids; however, their accuracy has
not been tested. The aim of the present study was to test the accuracy of a novel portion size estimation method using the width of the fingers as a ‘ruler’ to
measure the dimensions of foods (‘finger width method’), as well as fists and thumb or finger tips. These hand measures were also compared with house-
hold measures (cups and spoons). A total of sixty-seven participants (70 % female; age 32·7 (SD 13·7) years; BMI 23·2 (SD 3·5) kg/m2) attended a 1·5 h
session in which they estimated the portion sizes of forty-two pre-weighed foods and liquids. Hand measurements were used in conjunction with geometric
formulas to convert estimations to volumes. Volumes determined with hand and household methods were converted to estimated weights using density
factors. Estimated weights were compared with true weights, and the percentage difference from the true weight was used to compare accuracy between the
hand and household methods. Of geometrically shaped foods and liquids estimated with the finger width method, 80 % were within ±25 % of the true
weight of the food, and 13 % were within ±10 %, in contrast to 29 % of those estimated with the household method being within ±25 % of the true weight
of the food, and 8 % being within ±10 %. For foods that closely resemble a geometric shape, the finger width method provides a novel and acceptably
accurate method of estimating portion size.
Key words: Portion size estimation: Dietary assessment: Food records: Household measures
Accurate information about the food intake of individuals and
populations is notoriously difficult to obtain, is usually reliant
upon self-report and can be subject to large errors(1,2). There is
much debate in the literature about the value of self-reported
food intake, particularly for research into energy intake and
obesity(3,4). However, insight into the types and amounts of
foods consumed by individuals or populations is crucial in
any investigation about diet and health, for informing food
and nutrition policy, as well as being a valuable tool in clinical
and education settings(5).
Food records have been the choice of dietary assessment
method for national nutrition surveys in several countries(6–9)
and are used by clinicians and patients for monitoring
adherence to dietary prescriptions in clinical and educational
settings, particularly for weight management(10–12). Food
records involve the individual recording all food consumed
in real time (i.e. at the time of consumption) over a defined
number of days. Food records can be completed with pen
and paper or electronically (e.g. via a website or smartphone
application). Weighed food records – where individual foods
or ingredients are weighed prior to consumption – are consid-
ered precise, but the tedious nature of weighed food records
can change intake, and weighing foods is not always feas-
ible(2,13,14). As such, instead of weighed food records, esti-
mated food records are often used, where participants are
typically asked to estimate portion sizes in household measures

 (volumetric cups and spoons) or by describing the size of the
portion (‘small’, ‘medium’ or ‘large’). However, the reduction
in participant burden with estimated compared with weighed
food records is associated with impaired accuracy and consid-
erable error(2,13,15,16). Given the significant role of food
records in investigations of diet and health, as well as the
fact that food is frequently consumed away from home with-
out access to scales or other portion size estimation aids, there
is clearly a need for a method to estimate portion size that is
neither expensive nor burdensome, is flexible for use when
eating outside the home, and is relatively accurate.
The use of hands to estimate portion size can potentially fill
all of the above criteria. Hands are used by health profes-
sionals and the lay public as a guide to portion size(17). For ex-
ample, ‘a fist’, ‘thumb tips’ and ‘finger tips’ are used to estimate
one cup, one tablespoon and one teaspoon, respectively(18,19).
However, to our knowledge there have been no studies asses-
sing the accuracy of such hand-based methods. This is particu-
larly important given that hand sizes vary considerably
amongst individuals. Additionally, existing hand measures
(fists and thumb or finger tips) are merely an alternative to
household measures (cups and spoons), and thus have not
filled the gap in providing a way to quantify portion sizes of
foods that, without access to other portion size estimation
aids, may rely on subjective, categorical size estimates (small,
medium and large).
To provide a more objective measure of portion size, we
developed a novel way to use hands as a portion size estima-
tion aid. Specifically, the width of the fingers was used as a
‘ruler’ to measure the dimensions of foods, and geometric vol-
ume formulas and food density factors were subsequently
used to estimate weight. The primary aim of this study was
to test the accuracy of this novel finger width method to esti-
mate portion size, and to compare this with household mea-
sures. We hypothesised that the finger width method would
be superior to household measures, due to its comparatively
more objective measure of volume and size. A secondary
aim was to test the accuracy of fists and tips (thumb and fin-
gers) as portion estimation aids.
Methods
Subject recruitment and inclusion criteria
Participants (n 67) were staff and students at the University of
Sydney, as well as the general public. They were recruited by
flyers placed around the campus and on the university website.
The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki and was approved by the University of Sydney
Human Research Ethics Committee. To be eligible, partici-
pants had to be at least 18 years of age, have no vision impair-
ment and have functional use of both hands. All participants
provided informed written consent.
With forty-two food and liquid items to be estimated by all
participants, we aimed to recruit at least fifty participants, as
this would result in over 2000 observations of the test
method, which we reasoned was more than sufficient, given a
previous validation study which used a similar number of
foods (forty-five foods in the previous study compared with
forty-two foods in the current study), but each food was only
estimated by between twenty-one and twenty-five people (or ap-
proximately 1000 observations)(20). Due to interest in the study
we exceeded our recruitment target.
Selection and preparation of test foods
A total of twenty-one different foods and liquids, each in two
different sizes, were tested (Table 1). The selected foods and
liquids were designed to provide a diverse range of weights,
shapes, sizes and forms (not only solids and liquids, but also
amorphous and semi-solid). The aim was to include foods
and liquids that are often ambiguous in estimated food records
and for which further clarification is frequently required prior
to entry into nutrient analysis software. As such, foods that can
be quantified using units (e.g. a slice of bread or ten potato
chips) were not included. Foods were pre-cooked (if applic-
able) and pre-weighed, and were presented to participants on
27 cm diameter white plates. Liquids were presented in differ-
ent shaped glassware (a champagne flute and a wine glass for
wine, and a wide and a tall glass for juice). Honey was placed in
a small oval dish, and oil-based spread was placed on the tip of
a knife that was placed on a 27 cm diameter white plate. Solid
foods and liquids were categorised into one of three geometric
shapes they most closely resembled (triangular prism, cylinder
or rectangular prism), and were estimated with the finger width
method. Amorphous foods and muffins were estimated with
the fist method, and semi-solid foods (honey and oil-based
spread) were estimated with the tip method.
Although we had the true weight of the foods as the refer-
ence against which to assess accuracy of the hand method, we
included household measures (cups and spoons) and subject-
ive, categorical size estimates (small, medium and large) as
additional reference estimation methods, because these are
used in situations where people do not have access to scales
or other portion size estimation aids. Indeed, in the UK
Women’s Cohort Study, one of the largest cohort studies in-
vestigating associations between diet and cancer in the
UK(21), participants received the following written instructions
in their food record: ‘If you do not have scales at home, or if
you are eating food away from the home, then describe the
food you eat using household measures e.g. tablespoons,
cups, large glass etc.’(22). Categorical size estimations have
also been used in quantitative FFQ(23). Due to the inclusion
of participants from a wide range of ages, BMI and from both
sexes, as well as the lack of disaggregated Australian-specific me-
dian food portion sizes, we did not assign weights to the categor-
ical size estimations.
Procedure
The study was conducted over 5 d between 20 January and 2
February 2015. Upon arrival at the clinic, groups of two to
four participants at a time were taken through the study pro-
cedures. The procedure consisted of five stages, all of which
were conducted on the same day and took approximately
1·5 h to complete:

 (1) Household and size method explanation and practice. In the prac-
tice room (separate from the testing room), sets of volu-
metric household measuring cups (one cup, ¾ cup, ½
cup, ⅓ cup, ¼ cup) and spoons (one tablespoon, ½
tablespoon, one teaspoon, ½ teaspoon) were displayed
on a table along with seven practice food and liquid
items (beef steak, quiche, glass of milk, lemon tart, slice
of cake, plain spaghetti and peanut butter). Participants
were given a verbal explanation and demonstration of
how to estimate portion sizes using household measures
as an aid, and were asked to estimate and record the vol-
ume (in cups or spoons) of each food or liquid, using any
number including fractions or increments of whole num-
bers, e.g. 1/5 cup or 2·5 cups). Participants were told
that cups and spoons would not be provided during the
testing stage, to reflect real-world situations when estimat-
ing portion sizes away from home. They were also asked
to indicate the size (small, medium or large) of all of the
food and liquid items. Participants were encouraged to
seek assistance or ask questions during the practice session
if they were unsure about what to do.
(2) Household and size method testing. Participants were taken into
the testing room where forty-two test foods and liquids
were presented separately in test stations around one
long table (the order of which had been randomly deter-
mined). Participants were instructed which station to
start at, leaving an approximately even space between par-
ticipants, and to estimate portion size at that test station
using household measures and subjective size estimation
and to record their estimations on the data entry sheet, be-
fore moving onto the next test station, moving in a clock-
wise direction around the table. They were instructed to
not compare foods between test stations or on their data
entry sheet, which was checked for completeness prior
to moving on to the next stage.
(3) Hand method explanation and practice. Participants were pro-
vided with an explanation of each of the hand methods,
namely finger width, fist, and tips (thumb or index finger):
(a) Finger width. Participants were asked to measure the
dimensions of food items using the width of their
fingers (from the first joint of the little finger to
the second joint of the index finger) as a ‘ruler’.
This procedure was demonstrated as shown in
Fig. 1. For any one dimension they could use a frac-
tion of a finger (e.g. ½ a finger) or any number of
fingers they needed to take the measurement when
all fingers were side by side. For example, if more
than eight fingers were needed, they would have to
cross their arms and use the first hand again.
Participants were instructed to measure the food at
the longest, widest or highest point.
(b) Fist. For the fist method, participants were instructed
to compare the food against the volume of their fist
up until the wrist joint, and to estimate the volume of
the food in a multiple of the number of fists. They
were reminded that the volume of the hand does
not change whether it is flat or clenched into a fist,
and as such they could mould their hand into an al-
ternate shape to help them estimate the volume of
the food. Similar to the household method, they
were told that they could indicate in fractions of a
whole or greater than a whole fist.
(c) Tip. For the tip method, participants were instructed
to compare the food against the volume of the tip of

 their left or right thumb (up until the first joint or
crease) or index finger and to indicate how many
‘tips’ they thought the food was equivalent to.
Thumb and finger tips were indicated as separate
options on the data entry sheet for participants to se-
lect the more suitable option for the food.
(4) Hand method testing. As per stage 2, except that participants
were provided with a data entry sheet that was specific to
the hand methods. The data entry sheet prompted partici-
pants on what dimensions to measure (e.g. length, width
and height for foods that resembled a rectangular or tri-
angular prism in shape, and diameter and height for
foods in the shape of a cylinder) (Table 1).
(5) Anthropometric and hand measurements. Upon completion of
both estimation methods, participants were called individu-
ally into a private interview room, where their age and sex
were recorded and their height, weight and hand measure-
ments were measured and recorded. Height was measured
with a stadiometer (SECA model 220 Telescopic Height
Rod; SECA) to the nearest 0·1 cm with the participant look-
ing straight ahead and without shoes. Weight was taken in
light clothing and without shoes to the nearest 0·1 kg
(Tanita WB-100A; Tanita Corporation of America, Inc.).
The width of one finger was calculated from the average
width of four fingers from the non-dominant hand, mea-
sured using vernier calipers between the first joint of the lit-
tle finger (distal interphalangeal joint) and the second joint
of the index finger (proximal interphalangeal joint), with
the hand placed flat on a table, palm side down. Fist volume
was measured by weighing the water displaced from a bea-
ker when the fist was submerged up to the base of the palm.
Tip (thumb tip and fingertip) volumes were measured by
wrapping the whole thumb or finger in plastic film and
inserting up to the first crease into a jar of Play-Doh®
(Hasbro Australia Ltd). Volume was calculated from the
volume of water required to fill the resultant indentation.
All hand measures were taken in duplicate and repeated if
there was greater than 10 % discrepancy between the two
measures.
Data processing and analysis
Data were entered into Microsoft Excel from the paper forms
by one author (M. S. H. H.), and all data entry was checked for
Fig. 1. Demonstration of the finger width method for geometrically shaped foods and liquids. This method used the width of the fingers as a ruler to measure the
dimensions of a food or liquid. Foods or liquids estimated with this method were categorised into one of the three geometric shapes they most closely resembled: (a)
triangular prism, (b) cylinder or (c) rectangular prism. For triangular and rectangular prisms, the length, width and height of the foods were measured, and for foods
that resembled a cylinder, the diameter and height of the foods were measured. The number of finger widths for any given dimension was then converted to cm using
the average width of one finger. Using geometric formulas of the respective shapes, the dimensions of the foods or liquids were then converted to volumes, which
were in turn multiplied by density factors to calculate an estimated weight.

 accuracy by another author (A. A. G.). Raw data were con-
verted to an estimated volume using the equations shown in
Table 1. Estimated volumes were then converted to weights
using the food density factors also shown in Table 1.
Density factors were taken from the closest match of the
food item from the Food Measures Database in the most re-
cent version of the Australian Food, Supplement and Nutrient
Database (AUSTNUT) 2011–13(24).
Statistics
Data on participant characteristics and hand measurements are
presented as mean values and standard deviations and ranges.
A two-sample t test was used to compare participant charac-
teristics and hand measurements between females and males.
All other data were non-parametric and are presented as med-
ians and interquartile ranges. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were
used to compare the true weight of each food item with the
weight estimated with the hand method and the household
method. The Bonferroni correction was applied to correct
for multiple comparisons. The corrected significance level
was P < 0·001. Accuracy was calculated as the percentage dif-
ference between the estimated weight and the true weight of
the food, using the following equation: ((estimated weight −
true weight)/true weight) × 100. Thus, a positive value indi-
cates an overestimation and a negative value indicates an
underestimation of the true weight of the food. The median
percentage difference was then graphed to visually compare
the accuracy between each of the hand method subtypes
with the household method. The number of food or liquid
items in which the median estimation error fell within ±50 %,
±25 % and ±10 % of the true weight was calculated(20). For
the size method, the proportion of participants indicating
small, medium and large was calculated. All statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp.).
Results
Sample characteristics
Characteristics and hand measures of the sixty-seven partici-
pants are shown in Table 2. All hand measures were signifi-
cantly smaller for females than males. Interestingly, while fist
volume of males and females overall was almost exactly one
cup (250 ml), consistent with the popular notion that a fist
represents one cup, male fists were significantly greater in vol-
ume than female fists by approximately 100 ml (P < 0·001).
Additionally, a thumb tip overall was just slightly less than
the volume of a teaspoon (5 ml), despite often – albeit not al-
ways – being used as an estimate of a tablespoon in public por-
tion estimation recommendations.
Geometrically shaped foods and liquids estimated with the
finger width method, household method (cups) and size
descriptions
Geometrically shaped foods and liquids (n 30) were estimated
with the finger width method, as well as with the household
method (cups) and categorical size descriptors (Table 3).
When the estimated weights were compared with true weights,
there were eleven items for the finger width method and only
three for the household method for which the estimated
weight was not significantly different from the true weight.
Foods with estimated weights that were significantly different
from their true weight tended to be overestimated for both
methods (Table 3).
As the true weights of the foods and liquids ranged from
9·2 g for soft cheese (Brie) to 253·4 g for beef steak, the me-
dian percentage difference from the true weight shown in
Fig. 2 allows for a more standardised comparison between
the different foods and liquids and methods. Foods and
liquids that closely resembled the geometric shape used to cal-
culate volume with the finger width method tended to be more
accurately estimated than those that did not ‘fill’ or conform to
the geometric shape. For example, a slice of pizza or cake gen-
erally closely resembles a triangular prism, a glass of juice or
burger patty generally closely resembles a cylinder, and a
piece of hard cheese such as Feta generally closely resembles
a rectangular prism, and these were all well estimated using
the finger width method. In contrast, fish fillets, chicken
breasts and beef steaks are generally more irregular than a rect-
angular prism, and for all of these three foods in either size
(the six items at the bottom of Fig. 2), estimations with
both the finger width method and the household method
were all above 50 % of the true weight. For the remaining
twenty-four foods and liquids (the twenty-four items at the

 top of Fig. 2), all were within 50 % of the true weight – nine-
teen of these were within 25 % of the true weight and three
were within 10 % of the true weight – when estimated with
the finger width method. In contrast, only seventeen of
these twenty-four foods and liquids were within 50 %, seven
were within 25 % of the true weight and two were within
10 % of the true weight when estimated with the household
method (Fig. 2).
For the categorical size method (i.e. when participants were
asked to rate the food as small, medium or large), there were
no geometrically shaped foods for which 100 % of partici-
pants agreed on the size (Table 3). There were only eight geo-
metrically shaped foods, where ≥80 % of participants rated
the food as being of the same size (Table 3). For the fish fil-
let, chicken breast and beef steak (in both sizes) that were not
estimated well with either the finger width or the household
method, as mentioned above, the size method did not pro-
vide a good alternative (Table 3). For instance, for the larger
size of the fish fillet and the smaller size of the chicken
breast, there was an almost 50:50 split between the

 proportion of participants that rated the portion size as me-
dium and large and small and medium, respectively.
However, for the smaller and larger portions of beef steak,
which perhaps represent more extremes on the portion size
continuum, ≥80 % of participants rated the food as being
of the same size for both sizes. Therefore, categorical size
estimates of portion sizes are highly subjective, in that the
same portion of food was perceived as being of a different
size by different people.
Amorphous foods and muffins estimated with the fist method,
household method (cups) and size descriptions
Amorphous foods and muffins (n 8) were estimated with the
fist method, as well as with the household method (cups)
(Table 3) and categorical size descriptors (Table 4). Cereal
flakes (in both sizes) estimated with the household method
were the only amorphous foods in which there was no signifi-
cant difference between the estimated weight and true weight
(Table 3). Foods with estimated weights that were significantly
different from their true weight were all overestimated for both
methods (Table 3). There were only two food items in this cat-
egory for which ≥80 % of participants rated the food as being
of the same size (the smaller muffin and the smaller portion of
rice; Table 4).
The median percentage difference between the estimated
and true weight of amorphous foods and muffins is shown
at the top of Fig. 3. For the fist method, no food was esti-
mated to within 10 % of its true weight, only one food was
estimated to within 25 % of its true weight (the larger muffin),
one food was estimated to within 50 % of its true weight (the
larger portion of cereal flakes), and for all of the remaining six
foods, estimations were greater than 50 % of the true weight.
For the household method, three foods were estimated to
within 10 % of their true weight (both sized portions of the
cereal flakes and the larger oil-based spread), one food was
within 25 % of the true weight (larger muffin), and one
food was estimated to within 50 % (larger size of the rice)
of its true weight, and for all of the remaining four foods, esti-
mations were greater than 50 % of the true weight.
Spreads estimated with the tip method, household method
(spoons) and size descriptions
Spreads (n 4) were estimated with the tip (thumb or finger)
method, household method (tablespoons or teaspoons) and
size descriptions (Table 3). The estimated weight of all four of
these test food items was significantly different from their true
weights, when estimated with either the hand or the household
method (Table 3). Only the small portion of the oil-based spread

 resulted in ≥80 % of participants rating the food as being of the
same size, highlighting that spreads – like other foods and
liquids – are not well estimated with size descriptions, either.
The bottom section of Fig. 3 shows the median percentage
difference from the true weight for spreads estimated with
both the tip (thumb or finger) method and the household
method. Only the larger portion of the oil-based spread was
within 25 % accuracy for both methods (Fig. 3).
Discussion
Individuals have difficulty in accurately estimating portion
sizes using a variety of methods. The primary aim of this
study was to assess the accuracy of estimating portion sizes
using the width of the fingers as a ‘ruler’ to measure the
dimensions of foods and liquids that resemble geometric
shapes (triangular prisms, cylinders and rectangular prisms).
While there was a significant difference between the estimated
weight and true weight of 65 % of the thirty food items esti-
mated with the finger width method, our findings were in
line with our hypothesis that this method would be superior
to household measures or size descriptions, due to its com-
paratively more objective measure of volume and size.
Indeed, with the exception of both sizes of fish fillets, chicken
breasts and beef steaks, nineteen of the remaining twenty-four
foods and liquids estimated with the finger width method (80
%) were found to be within ±25 % of the true weight of the
food or liquid (and 100 % were within 50 % of the true
weight), compared with only seven of those estimated with
the household method (29 %, and 34 % being within 50 %
of the true weight). Our results are comparable with those
from a previous study investigating the use of food photo-
graphs to estimate portion size, which found that 83 % of
the 135 food portion estimations for forty-two food and liquid
items had mean estimations within 25 % of their true
weight(20). The advantage of the finger width method over
food photographs, however, is that fingers but not photo-
graphs are always available to people as a tool for portion
size estimation. To put a 25 % estimation error in context,
this equates to approximately one large mouthful of juice or
two large sips of wine from a portion of 150 ml, for example.
While the finger width method provided a reasonably accur-
ate method of portion size estimation for foods that closely
reassembled geometric shapes, it was not ideal in its current
format for estimating foods that did not conform well to a
geometric shape (e.g. fish fillets, chicken breasts and beef
steaks). There are several possible sources of error and poten-
tial solutions that could improve the accuracy of the finger
width method for irregularly shaped foods. The largest source
of error is most likely the assumptions involved in the use of
the geometric formulas used to convert the dimensions into an
estimated volume, combined with the fact that participants
were asked to measure the widest, longest or thickest point
of the food. Despite having fairly uniform dimensions for at
least one of the three dimensions measured (length, width or
height), the fish fillets, chicken breasts or beef steaks were nar-
rower at one or more points. Thus the food did not conform
or ‘fill’ the three-dimensional space created by the rectangular
prism calculated from these dimensions, causing overestima-
tions of the volumes and thus weights of the foods. A poten-
tial solution may be to ask participants to take an average
dimension (e.g. if the dimension was between two and four
finger widths, it would be recorded as three finger widths).
Another possible source of error with the finger width method
is the precision of the fingers for measuring dimensions.
Despite providing participants with instructions to estimate
using fractions of fingers, the majority of participants chose
to estimate the height (thickness) of foods in increments of
whole fingers. Consequently, if the thickness of a fish fillet,
chicken breast or beef steak was less than or greater than a
whole number of fingers thick, this would have introduced

 large error. For example, the height of the small fish fillet was
0·7 cm (or approximately half the average finger width), yet
over half (58 % or 39/67) of the participants reported the
height as one finger width. This suggests that in order to im-
prove the accuracy of this method, instructions provided to
participants may need to place greater emphasis on the import-
ance of using fractions of a finger, perhaps with the use of
examples to demonstrate how it can make an impact on the
accuracy of estimations. Alternatively, participants could be
provided with a ruler to measure the dimensions of a food,
which has greater precision, is portable, cheap and universal
and has been used in food recalls(25). The accuracy of estimat-
ing irregularly shaped cuts of meat with rulers has been studied
previously(26). In that study, participants were asked to esti-
mate the length, width and thickness of different cuts of
fish, chicken and meat using a ruler or size grid, after the
food was removed from sight. Mean estimation errors for
length and width were generally within −10 % of the actual di-
mension; however, thickness was consistently overestimated,
by an average of 30–40 %(26). Therefore, the accuracy may
have been higher had the participants used the ruler to meas-
ure the food directly, while it was still in sight. However, the
benefit of using finger widths over a ruler (or other two-
dimensional or three-dimensional portion size aids) is that a
person does not have to remember to carry anything with
them in order to estimate portion sizes, and it is potentially
also more socially acceptable than bringing out a ruler. In sum-
mary, possible sources of errors may be attenuated with future
modifications to the finger width method for foods that do not
conform closely to a geometric shape.
A strength of this study is that in addition to the ‘gold stand-
ard’ reference method of weighing, we compared the hand
methods against two additional reference methods: household
measures and subjective categorical size descriptions. Fewer
than a third of geometrically shaped foods estimated with
household measures were within 25 % accuracy. One might
argue that this finding is not surprising given that for many
of these foods, household measures may not be a ‘good’ com-
parison. For example, a slice of pizza is not usually estimated
in ‘cups’. However, our finding highlights that when food is
consumed away from home without access to scales or
other portion size estimation aids, for many geometrically
shaped foods, there was previously no ‘good’ way to estimate
portion size other than to use subjective descriptions of size
(hence the need for our finger width method). As we have
demonstrated here, subjective size categories are not a good
alternative to household measures, as there was little consen-
sus (except for portions which perhaps represented more
extremes on the portion size continuum) amongst participants
as to whether food portions were small, medium or large in
size, even though all participants were presented with the
same portion sizes. A previous study(27) investigated the accur-
acy of a ruler and a two-dimensional adjustable wedge to esti-
mate the length and width of wedge-shaped foods after they
had been removed from sight. On average, the total area of
pizza was underestimated by 20 %, and that of cake was over-
estimated by 20 %, which is similar to the error of volumes in
our present findings. However, in this study they did not
measure the thickness (or height) or the wedge-shaped
foods, so a comparison of error in volume (and accordingly,
weight) cannot not be made between that study and our pre-
sent work. Thus, notwithstanding the drawbacks associated
with the volumetric formulas as discussed above for foods
that do not conform to a geometric shape, having measure-
ments of the dimensions of a food or liquid through the use
of finger widths to estimate the size of a portion provides a
more objective and reproducible method for coding a portion
size compared with household measures or subjective size
descriptions.
A secondary aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of
fists and tips (thumbs and fingers) as portion size estimation
aids. Despite the average volume of a fist being approximately
one cup, as well as their potentially greater usefulness than
household measuring cups due to their malleability and con-
venience, amorphous foods were not as well estimated with
the fist method as with the household method. It is possible
that participants find it easier and more intuitive to visualise
‘filling’ an empty cup with the food when making volume

 estimations, rather than comparing the food with their fist,
which is already ‘filled’. Household cups and spoons are also
easier to code into dietetics software for analysis, as measuring
fist and finger or thumb tip volume using water is quite ardu-
ous and not feasible in many situations. Household measuring
cups are also of a standardised and known volume compared
with other household items such as tennis balls or golf balls
that may be used to guide portion size, the putative volume
of which has been shown to be quite erroneous(28). However,
despite the household method (cups) producing slightly less
error overall than the fist method for the smaller muffin,
mashed potato and rice portions, the median difference between
the estimated and true weights of foods was still around 50 %.
Our finding that individuals are not good at subjectively asses-
sing volume is in line with the findings of a previous study that
compared computer-calculated food volumes from photo-
graphs taken from a chest-worn camera device and those sub-
jectively estimated by three volunteers (including one who was a
dietitian) with the actual volume calculated through displace-
ment for 100 food items(29). The computer-calculated volumes
were with ±30 % of the true volume of 85 % of the food items,
compared with 15–57 % of the food items estimated by the
volunteers. Thus, this study shows the difficulty that people
have in making subjective volume estimations and that the ac-
curacy between people can be quite large. In summary, neither
the household method nor the fist method consistently esti-
mated the portion sizes of amorphous foods or muffins satis-
factorily, and their use in estimating portion sizes should be
interpreted with caution.
Dietary assessment research has increasingly focused on har-
nessing technology in an attempt to reduce cost and burden to
researchers and participants(11,30), and the finger width method
could complement these aims. One example is with electronic
food records in which data entry is completed by the participant.
However, whilst technological advances may help to reduce par-
ticipant and researcher burden by avoiding duplication of data
entry, dietary assessment methods are still subject to the same
types of measurement errors, including errors with quantifying
portion size. The finger width method could easily be incorpo-
rated into electronic food records to improve the accuracy of
portion size estimations by reducing the variability of subjective
estimation methods. For instance, finger width measurements
would be entered along with height and weight, allowing the cal-
culation of portion size to be automated. This would not only be
relevant to research, but could also be useful in clinical and edu-
cational settings, where the aim is to provide guidance on por-
tion sizes in relation to a clinical objective (e.g. weight loss).
However, the use of such an application of the finger width
method would be limited to those who own or know how to op-
erate such devices. On the other hand, the finger width method
can also be used – as in the present study – as a pen-and-paper
method, which makes it portable, inexpensive and universal.
These factors would make it suitable for field studies across dif-
ferent population groups, including ethnic minority groups, for
people with low literacy, or in contexts where technology is not
an option.
Our study design was intended to replicate real-world situa-
tions where participants complete food records in real time
(and therefore do not rely on memory) and without access
to other portion size estimation aids. The generalisability of
our findings to different populations, settings and dietary as-
sessment methods is limited by our sample and study design.
Whilst we did not impose restrictive inclusion criteria, and we
recruited people with a range of BMI and ages, our sample was
predominantly female, younger and neither overweight nor
obese. Our participants were predominantly university staff
and students, and were thus likely to be well educated. We
also did not assess prior experience with the use of portion
size estimation aids, which could have influenced our results.
Further, the training used in this study was brief, and more in-
tensive training, perhaps with the use of food models of
known volumes and sizes, could have increase the accuracy
of estimations(31–33). Additionally, the wide age range of parti-
cipants included in this study may have contributed to the
large variability in responses to the categorical size estimations.
For example, differences in metabolic needs, cognitive pro-
cessing capabilities or prior exposure to different portion
sizes between younger and older participants may have
increased or decreased estimation errors of particular foods
or liquids. Our study design could have also been improved
by using dividers to ensure that participants did not conscious-
ly or unconsciously compare between foods and liquids when
making estimations. Future research should investigate the use
of hand methods in a wider range of foods and liquids, as well
as retrospective portion sizes estimation, such as for use in
dietary recall interviews and in comparison with other types
of two-dimensional and three-dimensional portion size estima-
tion aids (e.g. food photographs).
In conclusion, portion size estimations for amorphous foods,
using hand or household measures, should be interpreted with
caution due to the considerable error associated with these tech-
niques for these food types. In contrast, for foods or liquids that
conform to a geometric shape, the finger width method may be
used to estimate portion size instead of household measures or
subjective categorical size descriptions. Thus, as the finger width
method is not suitable for all foods, it should be seen as a com-
plementary, rather than a stand-alone portion size estimation
method. However, this reflects the fact that food and liquid por-
tion size estimation requires the use of a combination of meth-
ods to match the various shapes and physical forms of foods.
The finger width method offers advantages over other options
because it is portable, inexpensive and universal, which would
make it suitable for studies in a wide variety of people and con-
texts, including limited access to technology. However, before
the finger width method can be used more generally, further val-
idation studies incorporating a wider range of foods and in spe-
cific population groups (e.g. younger, older, lower education
levels) should be conducted. Future studies should also investi-
gate ways to modify the finger width method to better estimate
more irregularly shaped foods such as fish fillets, chicken breasts
and beef steaks.
