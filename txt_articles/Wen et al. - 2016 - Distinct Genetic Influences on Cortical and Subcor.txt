This study examined the heritability of brain grey matter structures in a subsample of older adult 
twins (93 MZ and 68 DZ twin pairs; mean age 70 years) from the Older Australian Twins Study. The 
heritability estimates of subcortical regions ranged from 0.41 (amygdala) to 0.73 (hippocampus), and 
of cortical regions, from 0.55 (parietal lobe) to 0.78 (frontal lobe). Corresponding structures in the two 
hemispheres were influenced by the same genetic factors and high genetic correlations were observed 
between the two hemispheric regions. There were three genetically correlated clusters, comprising 
(i) the cortical lobes (frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes); (ii) the basal ganglia (caudate, 
putamen and pallidum) with weak genetic correlations with cortical lobes, and (iii) the amygdala, 
hippocampus, thalamus and nucleus accumbens grouped together, which genetically correlated with 
both basal ganglia and cortical lobes, albeit relatively weakly. Our study demonstrates a complex but 
patterned and clustered genetic architecture of the human brain, with divergent genetic determinants 
of cortical and subcortical structures, in particular the basal ganglia.
Brain structure is under strong genetic control, but how genes influence the organization of the brain is only begin-
ning to be understood1. The patterning of the cerebral cortex, known as arealization, has been systematically studied 
in animals2,3. Work on transcription factors, morphogens and signalling molecules in the rodent has shown how the 
regional identity of cortical areas develops4. The neocortex is also massively connected to the thalamus, basal ganglia 
and the hippocampus, but the genetic basis of specialisation of the subcortical nuclei and their relationship to cortical 
arealisation has received much less attention1. Twin studies have shown that the volumes of subcortical structures are 
under strong genetic control which accounts for 50–80% of the variance5–8. A recent collaborative study has identified 
common genetic variants that influence the volumes of the hippocampus, putamen and caudate9, but each accounted 
for only a small proportion of the heritability (h2). In the search for genes related to brain structures, it is important to 
know whether the relevant genes are shared by different structures or are unique to each structure. Additionally, cortical 
and subcortical structures are structurally and functionally related, and activity in one can help pattern the other. For 
instance, thalamocortical afferents are important in the ‘extrinsic’ patterning of the cortex through thalamic input4. 
While genetic influence on human cortex was previously investigated10,11, whether and how the genetic influence on 
cortical and subcortical structures is shared is an intriguing question that to date has not been examined.
The adult brain undergoes structural and functional changes with ageing, and these age-related changes are 
influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The regional patterning of the older brain is therefore likely 
to be the result of a complex interplay of development and ageing-related genes and interaction with extrinsic 
factors. Furthermore, developmental and lifespan changes in cortical thickness was found to associate with the

underlying genetic organizational principles of cortical thickness12. Unravelling this complexity is important to 
understand some of the mechanisms that underlie age-related brain diseases13.
The study of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins permits the estimation of heritability of a particular 
phenotypic measure, which is the proportion of the phenotypic variance accounted for by genetic factors. Twin 
studies of the cortex and subcortical structures using neuroimaging phenotypes have shown strong genetic influ-
ences on the volumes of these structures7,14–16. Multivariate methods can be applied to twin data to examine the 
genetic relationships between multiple phenotypes, informing us whether common or specific genetic influences 
are at work. Previous research on the genetic organization of the human brain has examined the cortical surface 
area and cortical thickness in men17–19, and the genetic contributions to subcortical structures and their corre-
lations in young5,8 and middle aged individuals6. To further our understanding of the genetic patterning of the 
human brain, the main objective of our study was to examine the genetic relatedness of cortical and subcortical 
structures in the Older Australian Twins Study, comprising individuals 65 years and older.
We used the grey matter volumes in our study and both cortical and subcortical structures were extracted 
using FreeSurfer20. The cortex was segmented into thirty-four gyral regions per hemisphere based on the 
Desikan-Killiany Atlas21. We calculated the volumes of four major lobes, i.e. frontal, occipital, parietal, and 
temporal as the sum of the relevant ROIs to reduce the number of parameters for some of the univariate and 
multivariate genetic modelling. The volumes of seven subcortical structures thalamus, caudate, putamen, pal-
lidum, hippocampus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens, and the Intracranial volume (ICV) were also measured. 
Heritability and genetic correlations adjusted for age, sex, scanners and ICV were estimated using univariate and 
multivariate structural equation modelling (SEM)22. Additional technical details on univariate and multivariate 
genetic modelling used here can be found in the methods section together with Figs 1 and 2.

Heritability of cortical and subcortical structures. 
The heritability estimates for total (left plus right 
hemisphere) volumes of the subcortical regions ranged from 0.41 for the amygdala to 0.73 for the hippocampus 
(see Table 2). For the cortical lobar regions, heritability ranged from 0.55 for the parietal lobe to 0.78 for the 
frontal lobe. The total intracranial volume (ICV) was highly heritable (h2 = 0.79). More finely defined individual 
cortical ROIs (region of interest) based on the Desikan-Killiany atlas21 showed varying levels of heritability, rang-
ing from ~0 (e.g. caudal anterior-cingulate cortex) to 0.67 (e.g. precentral gyrus, insula cortex). In general most 
of the small individual ROIs have very low heritability estimates with wider confidence intervals. Both cerebral 
hemispheres showed similar levels of heritability (Supplementary Table S1).
Bilateral symmetry of cortical and subcortical volumes. 
The heritabilities of the corresponding ROIs 
of the two hemispheres were found to be similar. To compute genetic correlations and test the significance of 
bilateral genetic sharing an Independent Pathway Model (IPM)22 was used (see the methods section for details). 
The genetic correlations between the ROIs of two hemispheres were found to be high (> 
0.7), suggesting common 
genetic determinants for the two hemispheres. The genetic contribution of the common factor of the two ROIs 
was greater than the specific genetic variance. The specific environmental variances were higher than the com-
mon environmental variance. The genetic correlations were much higher than the environmental correlations 
(Supplementary Table S2). For most of the ROIs, the genetic correlations between the homologous regions were 
found to be highly significant and also the test of genetic correlations rG = 1 tenable. The ROIs of caudal anterior 
cingulate, cuneus cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, rostral middle frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, insula cor-
tex, thalamus, pallidum and amygdala, the specific genetic components of the left and right regions were found to 
be different and hence rG were not unity.
Genetic overlap between cortical lobar and subcortical volumes. 
We evaluated the genetic correla-
tions among different ROIs (total volume as the sum of left and right) of the whole brain. The heatmap of genetic 
correlations among all the ROIs is presented in Supplementary Figure S1. The genetic correlations between cor-
tical gyral ROIs again varied considerably. In general, genetic correlations were higher between ROIs within the 
same lobe than between ROIs in different lobes, and the genetic correlations between subcortical regions and 
cortical ROIs were low.
Central to the aim of our study was the genetic sharing of the whole brain grey matter, including cortex 
and subcortical grey matter structures. A multivariate SEM was used to study the patterns of genetic correla-
tions among the four cortical lobes and seven subcortical regions. Starting from the saturated Cholesky model22 
together with the factor analysis, we identified a parsimonious three factor IPM with a single shared environmen-
tal component (Fig. 2). The first two factors divided the subcortical regions into two groups and the third factor 
corresponded to the cortical lobes. The first factor explained 19.6% of total genetic variance (sum of squares of 
path coefficients corresponding to ac1 divided by the sum of squares of path coefficients corresponding to ac1, ac2, 
ac3 and the eleven specific genetic components) with the majority (89%) explained by the hippocampus, amygdala

and thalamus (total genetic variance of ac1 was calculated as sum of squares of its path-coefficients), compared 
to 9.5% attributed to the cortical lobes. Similarly, the second factor explained 15.8% of the total genetic variance 
which represented the caudate, pallidum and putamen and the third factor explained 13.2% of genetic variance 
and included the four cortical lobes.
We observed that genetic and environmental correlations between cortical lobes had similar magnitude, with 
the highest genetic correlation observed between the parietal and temporal lobes (Table 3). In general, environ-
mental correlations between subcortical structures were higher than their corresponding genetic correlations; 
indeed, some genetic correlations were negative. A similar pattern was observed between subcortical structures 
and cortical lobes, again with higher environmental than genetic correlations, and some negative genetic cor-
relations. It should be however noted that genetic clusters use only the genetic correlations and hence clusters 
of ROIs are solely dependent on the extent of genetic correlations and not on the magnitude of environmental 
correlations.
The cluster analysis of the genetic correlation matrix based on the three-factor IPM also demonstrated three 
distinct clusters. Similar clustering was observed based on the phenotype correlation matrix obtained using the 
three factor IPM factor analysis (Fig. 3).
Discussion
We report a comprehensive examination of the genetic influence on cortical and subcortical structures in older 
adults of both sexes. In general, cortical and subcortical structures had moderate to high heritability, suggesting 
a strong underlying genetic basis for these brain phenotypes. Our analyses examined human cortex and sub-
cortical structures together and showed that in the context of whole brain grey matter structures, cortical lobes 
were genetically correlated with each other and formed a genetic cluster. The basal ganglia structures were highly 
correlated among themselves, forming a second cluster, and the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus and nucleus 
accumbens formed a third cluster. The hierarchical division of the eleven structures into three clusters demon-
strated fundamentally different genetic associations for cortical regions, basal ganglia and the other subcortical 
structures that are functionally and anatomically close to each other.

The fact that our study demonstrated that human brain cortex genetically formed a cluster of its own and the 
cortex was only weakly correlated to subcortical structures provided good evidence for investigating the genetics 
of these two divisions of cerebral grey matter independently. The vast majority of the literatures so far have indeed 
examined human brain cortex10,11,17–19,24–27 or subcortical structures5,6,8,9,28 separately and our findings are largely 
consistent with the literature in both cortical lobes and subcortical structures.
Our heritability estimates were moderate to high for both cortical and subcortical structures as has been 
previously reported14–16, but considerable heterogeneity in heritability values was observed. Of the subcortical 
structures, the hippocampus, putamen and caudate yielded higher heritability estimates, although confidence 
intervals overlap for most of the subcortical structures. Compared to other subcortical regions, the heritability 
estimates were lower for amygdala and nucleus accumbens, which is in agreement with previous reports5,8,25.
Structures in the two hemispheres showed similar levels of heritability, and modelling showed a common 
genetic factor accounting for much of the heritability in corresponding regions bilaterally. This is again consistent 
with previous reports which showed that the two hemispheres were genetic mirror images of each other7,17–19.
A previous study has shown that the influences of several common genetic polymorphisms on the brain are 
region specific and bilateral29. The aggregate effects of many polymorphisms such as this could explain the pat-
terns of bilateral similarity. This is further supported by data on gene expression patterns, which are also mirrored 
in the two hemispheres30. Such lateralization is also reflected in the anatomical patterns of bilateral atrophy in 
both normal ageing31 and many neurodegenerative syndromes such as Alzheimer’s disease32. Since the evidence 
of bilateral symmetry comes from an older cohort used in our study, it is consistent with bilateral symmetry for 
genetic influences on brain development as well as age-related change.
The most noteworthy finding of this study is the distinct genetic influences on cortical and subcortical struc-
tures, with little genetic covariation between any of the four cortical lobes and the seven subcortical regions. In 
our study, the shared genetic variance for the cortical regions, to some extent, had a lobar pattern, with regions 
within a lobe having higher genetic correlations (Supplementary Figure S1). For the lobes, the genetic similarity 
was greatest for the temporal, parietal and frontal lobes, with the occipital lobe showing lower shared genetic 
variance. Our data are consistent with those reported previously17,18, considering that our imaging measures 
were volumes which were influenced by both cortical area and thickness. Our approach of using pre-defined 
anatomical regions could not examine genetic variance according to functional specialisation in the cortex, but 
the clustering of lobar regions is a noteworthy pattern.
The basal ganglia (caudate, putamen and pallidum) formed a genetic cluster and the parts of the basal ganglia 
had either no genetic correlation (pallidum, putamen) or a weak but negative one (caudate) with cortical volume 
measures. The cluster comprising the amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus had moderate genetic correlations 
with the cortical regions, and the correlation between hippocampus and temporal lobe was relatively strong. 
Within the cluster that comprised the amygdala, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and thalamus, the amygdala 
and hippocampus had a high genetic correlation between them, and both structures, along with the nucleus 
accumbens, had moderate genetic correlations with the thalamus.
The correlations were estimated with ICV as a covariate. This is because a major proportion of the shared 
genetic variance between different brain regions is explained by a common genetic factor which also accounts for 
head size, and its proxy, the ICV5. It has been noted that some literature33,34 found that head size was related to 
body height, suggesting that general growth pathways influence both body and brain development which include 
the growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 135–37. We also note that there was report38 which did not 
share the same results.
The regionalisation of the brain occurs early in development and the precursor of both cortical and subcortical 
structures is the prosencephalon, which divides into the telencephalon and diencephalon39. The diencephalon 
gives rise to the thalamus and hypothalamus, and the telecephalon or the forebrain is the precursor of the cortex 
and subcortical structures such as the basal ganglia, hippocampus and amygdala. This patterning of the nervous 
system is under the control of various signalling pathways, such as sonic hedgehog, Wnt, retinoids, fibroblast 
growth factors and transforming growth factor-β 
40. Both extrinsic and intrinsic factors have been identified that 
interact to develop specific telencephalic domains41. It is not yet understood how these multiple patterning fac-
tors regulate each other’s function, and there are certainly other factors that are not known. Our study shows 
that genetic factors play a major role in this patterning, with common genetic factors shaping some subcortical 
structures but not others.
The human brain distinguishes from that of other species with the enormous expansion of the neocortex rela-
tive to total brain volume. With evolution, cortical thickness increases together with more dramatic enlargement 
in cortical surface size,42 which contribute to cortical volumes that we used as the imaging phenotype in this 
study. The relative genetic homogeneity between the cortical lobes in comparison with subcortical structures may 
reflect the similarity in laminar architecture across the entire neocortex43. It was found that there was a remarka-
ble degree of transcriptional uniformity of cortex compared to other brain regions30.
For the subcortical structures, Our findings suggest that the volumes and sizes of cortex and subcortical struc-
tures in ageing stages are not determined by a single set of genes, which are consistent with previous reports, 
but with a few notable differences. A previous study of middle aged male twins6 identified a basal ganglia/tha-
lamic factor and a limbic factor (hippocampus and amygdala) for shared genetic influence. A study of younger 
twins5 identified four factors: basal ganglia (caudate, putamen and pallidum), nucleus accumbens, amygdala 
and hippocampus/thalamus. Our results are closer to the latter study, although the genetic correlations between 
nucleus accumbens and other structures of the cluster were low, being 0.11 with amygdala, 0.21 with hippocam-
pus and 0.10 with thalamus in our study, after accounting for ICV. It is important to emphasize the consistencies 
between our findings and the literature. This is because although all three studies used the volumetrics extracted 
by FreeSurfer, ours had controlled for ICV and the young adult twins study5 and middle-aged male6 study had 
not. Despite the large differences in ages of the samples or whether the sample consisted both sexes or males only,

one of the common findings of previous studies5,6 and ours was that nucleus accumbens had the lowest heritabil-
ity as well as relatively low genetic correlation with o ther subcortical structures and with cortical lobes as shown 
in our sample. We speculate that one of the reasons that heritability values of nucleus accumbens and amygdala 
being relatively low was because of the less accurate segmentation due to the difficulties in delineation of a clear 
boundary. The relatively large variances because of their smaller sizes in comparison with other subcortical struc-
tures may also contribute to their weaker genetic correlations and thus large environmental factors5–7.
The OATS cohort had mean age of 70 years (range 65–85), and one would expect that the volumes of brain 
structures at this age are an end result of early developmental and later degenerative changes. Age-related changes 
in cortical thickness were found to follow closely the genetic organization of the cerebral cortex, and genetic 
factors contributed to cortical changes through life12. Our study has not examined the atrophy of the sample. An 
unexplored question is the interactions between genetics and brain diseases and how the trajectories of changes, 
such as how cortical and subcortical atrophy would differ from the normal genetic organization in different brain 
diseases. In an imaging study including both Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and behavioural-variant frontotemporal 
dementia patients, it was reported44 that AD patients had greater cortical atrophy than behavioural-variant fron-
totemporal dementia patients while behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia patients had greater atrophy in 
subcortical regions, especially in the striatum than AD patients over time. Indeed, our findings suggest that cor-
tical and subcortical volumetrics are weakly related genetically and age-related changes to these structures may 
take distinctively different trajectories. However, how genetic architecture and disease interplay and impact on 
their ageing and pathological trajectories are complex and future investigations should take into account of both. 
MRI studies show that cortical thickness starts to decrease from childhood45,46, and the age-related trajectories are 
often nonlinear such as observed in the basal ganglia47. Our work focused on the ageing population as the mean 
age of our participants were 70 and there is evidence of an age-related reduction in volume, which accelerates 
with age31,48. The age-related changes have been well documented for the hippocampus49. It is quite likely that the 
genetic influences of neurodevelopment and patterning are different from the genes that determine age-related 
decline. One would expect that the genetic contributions to brain structure would be higher in the younger cohort 
and environmental factors would become more prominent with ageing. Data from cross-sectional studies support 
this conclusion15.
Our study has a number of limitations. First, we subdivided the cortex using a non-genetically based atlas21 
which uses major sulci for lobar and regional classification, and the subcortical structures were delineated by 
their anatomical boundaries. Since each cortical parcellation and/or lobe comprises smaller sub-entities that 
may be genetically heterogeneous18, our approach to use non-genetically based cortical subdivision may bring in 
unintended inaccuracy. Similarly, the assumption that a subcortical structure such as the caudate is genetically 
homogenous is unlikely to be true. Ideally, the genetic basis of these structures should be examined with no 
anatomical constraints, but this introduces a higher level of complexity in the analysis, which must then proceed 
structure by structure rather than at the whole brain level. Second, as noted above, segmentation of nucleus 
accumbens and amygdala may be less accurate than other subcortical structures. As our primary interest is to 
show only the patterns of heritability and genetic correlations, all our results are presented without correcting for 
multiple hypotheses testing. Although it was said that surface area and cortical thickness had been found to be 
genetically and phenotypically independent50 and volumes which we used in the present study were the product 
of these two, the volumetrics had been the better imaging phenotype for our study because we could use volumes 
for both cortex and subcortical structures and our question was how genetic influence on cortical and subcortical 
structures was shared.
In conclusion, this study is the first attempt to examine the genetic correlations between human cortex and 
subcortical structures, using the twin design. The data showed that cortical and subcortical structures had mod-
erate to high heritability, and formed three genetic clusters. The cortical lobes (frontal, temporal, parietal and 
occipital) were genetically correlated with each other and formed one cluster. The basal ganglia (caudate, putamen 
and pallidum) were highly correlated with each other, forming a second genetic cluster, and the amygdala, hip-
pocampus, thalamus and nucleus accumbens formed a third cluster. Additionally, the genetic influences on brain 
structures were bilaterally symmetrical. This patterning of the heritability of brain structures has important impli-
cations for investigations into the genetic blueprint of the human brain.
Methods
Participants. 
Our study cohort was drawn from Wave 1 of the Older Australian Twins Study (OATS), a study 
 
of twins aged 65 years or older living in the three Eastern states of Australia (New South Wales, Victoria and 
Queensland) primarily recruited from the Australian Twin Registry (ATR). Methodology of OATS has previ-
ously been described in detail51. The zygosity of each twin pair had been confirmed previously by genotyping 
with high-density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. This study was approved by the ethics committees of 
the Australian Twin Registry, University of New South Wales, University of Melbourne, Queensland Institute of 
Medical Research and the South Eastern Sydney & Illawarra Area Health Service. Informed consent was obtained 
from all subjects and the methods were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines.
Image Acquisition. 
MRI data were obtained on three 1.5 Tesla scanners and a 3 Tesla scanner owing to the 
multi-site nature of this study. Siemens Magnetom Avanto and Sonata scanners (Siemens Medical Solutions, 
Malvern PA, USA) with similar years of manufacture and upgrade were used in centres 2 (Victoria) (114 partici-
pants) and 3 (Queensland) (92 participants), respectively. In centre 1 (New South Wales), a 1.5 T Philips Gyroscan 
scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands) (80 participants) was used initially, followed by a 3 Tesla 
Philips Achieva Quasar Dual scanner (36 participants). The acquisition protocols and parameters were tested 
and matched between the centres through standardization of spatial resolution and slice thickness, using a 3D 
phantom to correct geometric distortions, and using five volunteers who were scanned on the four scanners51.

Twin pairs were always scanned on the same scanner and were scanned either on the same day or within a few 
weeks of each other.
The 3D T1-weighted MRIs scans were used for computing the neuroimaging phenotypes for cerebral cortex 
and subcortical structures. 3D T1-weighted volumetric sequence was performed using a similar protocol for 
the 1.5 Tesla scanners in the three centres with in-plane resolution = 
 1 × 
 1 mm, slice thickness = 
 1.5 mm, slice 
number = 
 144, TR (Repetition time) = 
 1530 ms, TE (Echo time) = 
 3.24 ms, TI (Inversion time) = 
 780 ms, and 
flip angle = 
 8. The acquisition parameters for the 3 Tesla Philips scanner in centre 1 were: TR/TE = 
 6.39/2.9 ms, 
in-plane resolution = 
 1 × 
 1 mm, slice thickness = 
 1 mm, slice number = 
 190, resulting isotropic voxels of 
1 × 
 1 × 
 1 mm3. Two 3D T1-weighted scans were acquired for each participant for an increased signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR).
Image Processing. 
Scans were excluded if they failed visual quality control. Both cortical and subcortical 
structures were extracted using FreeSurfer v5.3.020. Briefly, the processing includes motion correction and aver-
aging of the T1-weighted images52, removal of non-brain tissue53, automated Talairach transformation, segmenta-
tion of subcortical structures54,55, intensity normalization56, tessellation of grey matter and white matter boundary 
and automated topology correction57,58, and surface deformation20. Using Desikan-Killiany Atlas21, we segmented 
cortex into 13 frontal, 9 temporal, 4 occipital, 7 parietal, and insula ROIs and the lobar (four major lobes, i.e. 
frontal, occipital, parietal, and temporal with both left and right hemisphere) volumes were calculated as the 
sum of the relevant ROIs to reduce the number of parameters for some of the univariate and multivariate genetic 
modelling. The volumes of subcortical structures in both left and right hemispheres including thalamus, cau-
date, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens, and ICV were measured also using 
FreeSurfer. The accuracy of both cortical and subcortical structure segmentation and registration by FreeSurfer 
was visually checked using the FreeSurfer’s TKMEDIT toolbox.
Statistical analyses. 
Demographics. Equality of means between the two zygosity groups for the continu-
ous measurements (age, education and mini-mental state examination) was assessed by t-test, and equality of pro-
portion of sexes was assessed by chi-square test. Since the t-test and chi-square test may not be valid in the case 
of dependent observations (among MZ and DZ pairs), p-values were computed using a permutation procedure 
(Table 1). Zygosity of pairs was first permutated and then observations from two sets of pairs were interchanged59.
Heritability. The phenotypic covariance between the twin pairs can be modelled as a function of additive genetic 
(A), shared environmental (C) and unique environmental (E) components using the mixed effects linear model 
or SEM. Under SEM, the model containing the three latent factors (A, C and E), known as the ACE model, was 
fitted to estimate the heritability (Fig. 1A). For parsimony, models containing the components A and E (AE), C 
and E (CE), and E were compared with the full ACE model using likelihood ratio tests22. The path coefficient are 
denoted (throughout of the manuscript) with lower-case letters a, c, and e with the corresponding variance com-

2, and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the total – left plus right hemisphere – vol-
umes of cortical and subcortical regions, as well as ICV were estimated under the univariate ACE model.
Genetic correlation. A bivariate ACE Cholesky model was then used to estimate the genetic correlations (rG) 
between all possible pairs of the seven subcortical and thirty-four cortical regions. Likelihood ratio tests were used 
to compare the bivariate ACE model with AE, CE and E models. Since the AE model was not parsimonious for 
all pairs of correlations, the genetic correlations were finally reported based on the ACE model (Supplementary 
Figure S1).
Hemispheric symmetry. In addition to the genetic correlation analysis using a bivariate Cholesky model, an 
independent pathways model with three common factors (Ac, Cc, Ec) and three specific factors (As, Cs, Es) for 
each ROI was used to assess the genetic common and specific factors between the corresponding ROIs of the two 
hemispheres (Fig. 1B). Lateral symmetry of left versus right ROI was tested by constraining the common genetic, 
shared environmental and unique environmental path coefficients for the two regions to be equal60. Under twin 
designs, large sample sizes are required to estimate the shared environmental components (cc and cs)61. Hence, to 
identify the most parsimonious model, the full ACE model was fitted (with ac1 = 
 ac2; cc1 = 
 cc2; ec1 = 
 ec2) and then 
compared with a reduced model AE (Fig. 1B, constrained with cc1 = 
 cc2 = 
 0; cs1 = 
 cs2 = 
 0) and CE (ac1 = 
 ac2 = 
 0; 
as1 = 
 as2 = 
 0) using the likelihood ratio test. For most of the ROIs, the AE model was as good as the ACE model 
(p-AE > 
 0.5 and minimum Akaike information cirteria (AIC); Supplementary Table S2); hence, the independent 
AE model was used to estimate the genetic correlation as well as testing the significance of the genetic correlation 
rG = 0 and bilateral symmetry (rG = 1).
Genetic relationship between cortical lobes and subcortical structures. Our sample size would be too small to 
employ a full multivariate analysis involving all thirty-four cortical and seven subcortical ROIs. Therefore, for 
multivariate SEM, we considered only the four major cortical lobes and seven subcortical ROIs. We first obtained 
the phenotype correlation matrix through the eleven ROI saturated Cholesky model. To construct a parsimonious 
model with less number of genetic factors we performed hierarchical cluster and factor analysis using the pheno-
type correlation matrix. We have decided a three component latent factor model for our final solution based on 
the scree plot of the factors and the hierarchical cluster solution (supplementary Figures S2 and S3). Therefore, 
we first fitted a three component IPM, and for model parsimony we compared the three factor IPM with some of

its sub-models and the ACE Cholesky model. We finally selected a three factor IPM (Fig. 2) with three common 
additive genetic factors, unique environmental factors, one common shared environmental factor together with 
ROI specific genetic and environmental components.
The univariate, bivariate and multivariate SEM were carried out using the openMx (2.0.1) R package62. 
Heritability, genetic correlations were estimated after adjusting for the covariates age, sex, scanners and ICV in 
the means of the univariate and multivariate twins SEM. All the analyses were carried out using the R software63.
Model selection summary for multivariate SEM model. To evaluate the pattern of genetic clustering among the 
cortical and subcortical ROIs, we have undertaken a multivariate SEM analysis. Based on the factor and cluster 
analysis of the phenotype correlation matrix, we decided a three factor IPM for the eleven ROIs. A comparison 
within the three factor IPMs showed that the model with a single common shared environmental and three 
genetic and unique environmental factors (IPM2 as shown in Supplementary Table S3) provided a parsimonious 
fit (minimum AIC and p-value > 0.5) when compared to the other two models.
The IPM was also compared with the ACE Cholesky model. The eleven ROIs AE Cholesky model was as good 
as the ACE Cholesky model (p-value ≈ 1). Within the Cholesky models, the model with three latent components 
was not comparable to the eleven latent component model (Supplementary Table S4). However the three factor 
IPM model (IPM2) was as good as the full Cholesky model and hence the IPM2 model was selected as the final 
model for our analysis.
