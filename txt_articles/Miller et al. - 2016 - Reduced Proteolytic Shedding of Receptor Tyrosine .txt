ABSTRACT  
 
 
 
Kinase inhibitor resistance often involves upregulation of poorly understood 
“bypass” signaling pathways. Here, we show that extracellular proteomic adapta-
tion is one path to bypass signaling and drug resistance. Proteolytic shedding of surface receptors, 
which can provide negative feedback on signaling activity, is blocked by kinase inhibitor treatment and 
enhances bypass signaling. In particular, MEK inhibition broadly decreases shedding of multiple recep-
tor tyrosine kinases (RTK), including HER4, MET, and most prominently AXL, an ADAM10 and ADAM17 
substrate, thus increasing surface RTK levels and mitogenic signaling. Progression-free survival of 
patients with melanoma treated with clinical BRAF/MEK inhibitors inversely correlates with RTK shed-
ding reduction following treatment, as measured noninvasively in blood plasma. Disrupting protease 
inhibition by neutralizing TIMP1 improves MAPK inhibitor effi
 cacy, and combined MAPK/AXL inhibition 
synergistically reduces tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft models. Altogether, extracellular 
proteomic rewiring through reduced RTK shedding represents a surprising mechanism for bypass sig-
naling in cancer drug resistance. 
 
SIGNIFICANCE: Genetic, epigenetic, and gene expression alterations often fail to explain adaptive 
drug resistance in cancer. This work presents a novel post-translational mechanism of such resistance: 
Kinase inhibitors, particularly targeting MAPK signaling, increase tumor cell surface receptor levels 
due to widely reduced proteolysis, allowing tumor signaling to circumvent intended drug action.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Mere overexpression of a drug’
s target often fails to predict 
effi
 cacy, in part due to “bypass” signaling whereby inhibition 
of one signaling pathway leads to compensatory signaling 
through alternative routes. Previous work has largely focused 
on how intracellular processes such as gene expression 
changes and mutations contribute to bypass signaling, het-
erogeneous drug responses, and drug resistance. For example, 
targeting MAPK signaling through MEK or BRAF inhibition 
leads to increased transcription of multiple receptor tyrosine 
kinases (RTK), which then provide alternative progrowth and 
prosurvival signals that circumvent the intended inhibitor 
effects ( 
1–3 
). However, genetic and gene expression changes 
account for only a fraction of observed bypass signaling ( 
4, 5 
). 
For instance, only half of patients with melanoma receiving 
BRAF inhibitor therapy exhibit mutations in known BRAF 
resistance genes upon emergence of drug resistance; a large 
fraction of drug resistance arises without defi
 ned genetic 
or epigenetic explanation; and the functional consequences 
of common genetic or translational alterations often still 
depend on the activity of signaling through RAS–CRAF and 
other pathways ( 
6 
). Importantly, these observations carry 
substantial implications in the clinic, where many strategies 
for designing and monitoring an individual’
s therapeutic 
course rely largely on genetic or transcriptional information. 
 
This work investigates several cancer types where bypass 
signaling is evident ( 
1, 2, 7, 8 
) and focuses primarily on malig-
nant melanoma and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), 
a subtype of breast cancer with a poor prognosis and no 
approved targeted therapies, and which is classifi
 ed by low 
expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and 
HER2 ( 
9 
). MEK inhibition (MEKi) represents one promising 
therapeutic strategy, as MAPK signaling is dysregulated in 
many cancers, including TNBC and melanoma ( 
9, 10 
), and 
clinical trials have recently been completed or are ongoing 
in several cancers, including TNBC ( 
9 
). As a treatment strat-
egy, MAPK inhibition (MAPKi) has been most successful in 
melanoma, with three such inhibitors gaining FDA approval 
since 2011. However, resistance to MAPKi develops in most 
patients within a year ( 
11 
). More generally, MAPKi carries 
broad importance, given that many other relevant drug tar-
gets, including various RTKs, are upstream of the MAPK 
pathway and indirectly affect its activity. 
 
Relative to tumor gene expression changes, little attention 
has been paid to how the tumor-derived extracellular pro-
teome changes in response to targeted kinase inhibitors, and 
how such changes affect bypass signaling and drug effi
 cacy. Of 
central importance, the A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinases

RESEARCH ARTICLE
(ADAM) ADAM10 and ADAM17 are widely known as the 
principal “sheddases” of the cell surface responsible for 
shedding ectodomains of hundreds of transmembrane sub-
strates, including many growth factors, cytokines, adhesion 
molecules, and metalloproteinases involved in the processes 
described above. ADAM10 is required for activation of the 
Notch signaling pathway, whereas ADAM17 is needed for 
TNF 
α cleavage, and both  
Adam10

/ 
 
−  
 
 and  
Adam17 
 
−  
/ 
 
−  
 
 mice 
are not viable ( 
12 
).  
ADAM10 and  
ADAM17 are particularly 
overexpressed in many cancers, including breast cancer and 
melanoma ( 
13, 14 
), with activities governed by frequently dys-
regulated MAPK signaling ( 
10, 15 
). Furthermore, ADAM10 
and ADAM17 have been considered promising drug targets 
for their part in shedding EGF-family growth factor ligands 
from the surface of cancer cells, a process that mediates 
ERBB-family receptor mitogenic signaling in an autocrine 
manner ( 
13, 16, 17 
). Unfortunately, metalloproteinase inhibi-
tors, including a second-generation inhibitor with specifi
 city 
toward ADAM10 and ADAM17 (INCB7839; Incyte), have 
failed in clinical trials despite promising initial results ( 
18 
). 
These failures can largely be attributed to a poor understand-
ing of how the broad activity of ADAMs, and metalloprotein-
ases in general, integrates to infl
 uence overall tumor behavior 
( 
19 
). 
 
Here, we identify differential extracellular proteolytic shed-
ding as a major post-translational mechanism of bypass sig-
naling that complements other pathways of drug resistance. 
Proteolytic shedding of surface receptors, which can provide 
negative feedback on signaling network activity, is dramati-
cally reduced upon inhibition of kinase pathways such as 
the MAPK pathway. Decreased RTK proteolysis consequently 
leads to surface RTK accumulation and increased signaling 
through other pathways that support mitogenesis. Thus, 
we hypothesized that RTK proteolysis could (i) be nonin-
vasively monitored in patients; (ii) enable early detection 
of drug resistance in the clinic; and (iii) guide the design 
of combination therapies that forestall disease progression. 
Indeed, we found that circulating RTKs were detectable at 
elevated levels in a subset of patients and that shed RTK 
levels accurately predicted clinical MAPKi response better 
than mere RTK gene expression. We tested two strategies to 
enhance MAPKi effi
 cacy: (i) modulating ADAM10 through 
neutralizing its cognate inhibitor tissue inhibitor of metal-
loproteinases 1 (TIMP1) and (ii) inhibiting the RTK AXL, a 
key protease substrate that we observed to be upregulated 
following MAPKi. In several orthotopic animal models, com-
bination therapies exhibited synergistic effects on tumor 
growth, metastasis, and survival. Altogether, our fi
 ndings 
demonstrate that extracellular proteomic rewiring through 
reduced proteolytic receptor shedding represents a signifi
 cant 
and targetable mechanism for bypass signaling in acquired 
cancer drug resistance. 
 
 
 
RESULTS 
 
MAPKi Causes a Global Reduction in 
Circulating RTKs 
 
RTK signaling mediates drug resistance ( 
1, 7, 20 
), and 
the release of RTK ectodomains from the cell surface has 
become an increasingly appreciated regulator of signaling 
activity in contexts of cancer metastasis ( 
21 
), antibody thera-
pies ( 
22 
), and in other invasive diseases ( 
15 
). However, little 
is known regarding how extracellular RTK levels change in 
response to targeted kinase inhibitor treatment, and how 
such changes infl
 uence drug effi
 cacy in cancer. To study these 
effects, we fi
 rst measured how MEKi affects the supernatant 
accumulation of seven key RTKs that have been implicated 
in drug resistance: the four ERBB-family receptors (EGFR, 
HER2, HER3, and HER4); insulin-like growth factor receptor 
1 (IGF1R); hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR/MET); 
and the TAM family member RTK AXL. Using two MEK 
inhibitors, U0126 and PD325901 [ 
Fig. 1A 
; Supplementary 
Fig. S1A validates reduction in phosporylated ERK (pERK)], 
we examined a panel of 12 cell lines from several cancer types 
where bypass signaling has been implicated, including malig-
nant melanoma (MM), TNBC, non–small cell lung cancer, and 
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We surprisingly found that 
only decreased (rather than increased) supernatant RTK accu-
mulation was consistently and signifi
 cantly observed across 
the panel of measurements ( 
Fig. 1A 
 and  
B 
). Most prominently, 
supernatant AXL and MET decreased by roughly 50% in nearly 
every cell line. We confi
 rmed by ultra-centrifugation that AXL 
and MET were unassociated with supernatant microvesicles 
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). Supernatant accumulation of both 
RTKs could be blocked by broad-spectrum metalloproteinase 
inhibition (MPi) using batimastat (BB94), suggesting their 
accumulation resulted from proteolytic release off the cell 
surface 
 (Supplementary Fig. S1C). EGFR, which is not a sus-
pected metalloproteinase substrate, behaved in stark contrast 
to MET and AXL: In the supernatant, EGFR (i) did not con-
sistently decrease in response to MEKi ( 
Fig. 1A and B 
), (ii) was 
substantially associated with microvesicles (Supplementary 
Fig. S1B), and (iii) did not decrease in response to MPi (Sup-
plementary Fig. S1C). Thus, we fi
 nd that MEKi treatment 
induces signifi
 cant changes in supernatant RTK levels, which 
contain a combination of free proteolytically shed soluble 
receptor (as with AXL and MET), and surface receptor on 
microvesicles (as with EGFR), with the signifi
 cant effects of 
MEKi dominated by the former ( 
Fig. 1A and B 
). 
 
 
We next examined if reduced accumulation of extracellular 
RTK ectodomain was detectable in mice undergoing MAPKi 
therapy. We used two different xenograft tumor models: sub-
cutaneous  
BRAF 
-mutant melanoma using LOX-IMVI cells 
and orthotopic TNBC using the  
BRAF 
/ 
KRAS- 
mutant LM2 
cells. With human-specifi
 c solution-phase immunoassays, we 
measured plasma levels of tumor-derived receptors in tumor-
bearing mice following drug treatment. Indeed, MAPKi using 
combined MEKi (trametinib) and BRAFi (vemurafenib) treat-
ment in the melanoma model decreased circulating levels 
of tumor-derived AXL and MET ( 
Fig. 1C 
). Similarly, MEKi 
signifi
 cantly reduced levels of the circulating AXL and MET 
in mice with mammary fat pad tumors ( 
Fig. 1D 
). 
 
To test whether this RTK ectodomain accumulation may 
be relevant to clinical pathology, we measured circulating lev-
els of AXL, MET, HER2, and HER4 ectodomains in patients 
with stage I and stage IV breast cancer along with healthy 
controls, and observed that AXL contributes to an overall pat-
tern of increased RTKs in patients (Supplementary Fig. S1D–
S1F). The combined level of these four RTKs in a given serum 
sample increased signifi
 cantly in patients with breast cancer

Drug Resistance via Reduced RTK Shedding

who have not been exposed to the inhibitors shown here, 
compared with healthy controls (Supplementary Fig. S1D). 
In other words, roughly 50% of stage I (10/20) and stage IV 
(9/19) patient samples exhibited a “quadruple-positive” phe-
notype with increased levels of all four RTKs in circulation, 
compared with 5% (1/20) of healthy controls (Supplementary 
Fig. S1E). Among “quadruple-positive” samples, circulating 
RTK levels in stage IV patients were 40% higher than levels 
from stage I patients (Supplementary Fig. S1E;  
P 
 
 = 
 0.03, 
two-tailed  
t 
 test). The statistical signifi
 cance of an elevated 
serum RTK signature was dependent upon inclusion of AXL 
measurements (Supplementary Fig. S1F), indicating it as the 
most vital among the four. These data confi
 rm that stage I 
and especially advanced metastatic stage IV diseases are asso-
ciated with changes in RTK shedding that are detectable 
circulating in human patients. 
 
 
 
Circulating RTK Levels but Not Their Mere Tumor 
Expression Predict MAPKi Resistance in Patients 
with Melanoma 
 
We next investigated whether reduced RTK ectodomain 
levels were observable in patients undergoing MAPKi therapy 
and if markers of RTK accumulation correlated with clinical 
outcomes. Plasma, rather than serum which was used in the 
breast cancer cohort, was collected from patients with mela-
noma who were undergoing treatment with a combination

of trametinib (MEKi) and dabrafenib (BRAFi), both before 
and while on treatment. As a surrogate marker of RTK shed-
ding, we measured soluble levels of six RTKs known to be 
sheddase substrates, MET, HER2, HER4, and the three TAM 
receptors (AXL, MERTK, and TYRO3), using solution-phase 
antibody arrays ( 
Fig. 1E 
; Supplementary Fig. S1G). With this 
blood-based test, we found that patients showing high levels 
of circulating RTKs before MAPKi treatment exhibited rapid 
disease progression ( 
Fig. 1F 
). Motivated by the hypothesis 
that reduced RTK shedding may lead to MAPKi resistance, 
we next examined (i) if circulating RTK levels changed with 
MAPKi treatment, and (ii) if changes correlated with disease 
progression. We found that 5 of 11 patients, principally those 
with high initial circulating RTK levels, showed decreased cir-
culating RTK levels upon initiation of MAPKi treatment ( 
Fig. 
1G 
), and that disease rapidly progressed in these patients 
( 
Fig. 1H 
). In fact, these circulating RTK changes were highly 
predictive of progression-free survival (PFS;  
P 
 
 = 
 0.005;  
n 
 
 = 
 11; 
two-tailed log-rank test;  
Fig. 1H 
). In contrast, initial tumor 
response as measured by RECIST failed to reliably predict 
PFS in a statistically signifi
 cant manner ( 
P 
 
 = 0.08;  
n 
 
 = 
 11; 
two-tailed log-rank test), as observed in other cancers ( 
23 
), 
thus demonstrating the comparative superiority of circulat-
ing RTKs as predictive markers of disease progression. 
 
We next examined whether mere RTK expression in the 
tumor, rather than levels of circulating RTKs, could similarly 
predict PFS in patients. In the same cohort used to assess 
circulating RTKs, total tumor AXL measured by immunohis-
tochemistry of its intracellular C-terminus failed to correlate 
with PFS (Supplementary Fig. S1H). Furthermore, in an 
independent dataset of 21 patients with melanoma undergo-
ing BRAFi therapy, RNA expression of the six RTKs meas-
ured here did not substantially predict PFS (Supplementary 
Fig. S1I). Upregulation of RTK RNA expression, measured by 
comparing matched gene expression before and after BRAFi 
therapy began, only mildly trended toward worse PFS, but 
the difference was not signifi
 cant (Supplementary Fig. S1J; 
 
P 
 
 = 
 0.055, two-tailed log-rank test). These results, combined 
with the aforementioned TNBC and melanoma xenograft 
studies, show that circulating RTK levels (i) can be non-
invasively, quantitatively, and longitudinally monitored in 
patients undergoing MAPKi treatment, (ii) provide an early 
indication of MAPKi effi
 cacy, (iii) are more predictive of MAPKi 
effi
 cacy than mere expression in the tumor, and (iv) may conse-
quently have utility as a patient selection criterion. 
 
 
 
MEKi Increases Total and Phosphorylated AXL 
on the Cell Surface 
 
We next investigated the relationship between AXL levels 
in circulation and within the tumors of patients with mela-
noma. We used samples from patients with similar initial 
tumor responses by RECIST (Supplementary Fig. S2A), yet 
very different plasma RTK patterns and times of disease pro-
gression ( 
Fig. 2A 
). To simultaneously measure total tumor 
AXL and its ectodomain release from the tumor, we compared 
immunostaining by antibodies targeting either the AXL intra-
cellular C-terminus (corresponding to total tumor AXL) or 
the N-terminus ectodomain (the latter was also used to detect 
circulating AXL in plasma). In one patient exhibiting relatively 
long PFS (patient #9), low plasma AXL levels ( 
Fig. 2A 
, top 
row) corresponded to low tumor AXL levels before treatment 
( 
Fig. 2B 
, top row). A sustained increase in AXL and other 
RTKs was detected in plasma ( 
Fig. 2A 
, top row) with MAPKi 
treatment initiation, and indeed C-terminus AXL expression 
was detected at higher levels in a subset of the tumor cells 
analyzed on treatment ( 
Fig. 2B 
; Supplementary S2B). In 
contrast, another patient showing rapid disease progression 
(patient #4) exhibited high pretreatment AXL levels both in 
plasma and in the pretreatment tumor ( 
Fig. 2A and B 
, bot-
tom row), but tumor AXL appeared to be shed at high levels: 
although AXL C-terminus was high in this tumor, ectodo-
main staining was low by comparison. Even though plasma 
AXL levels declined with MAPKi therapy in this patient ( 
Fig. 
2B 
, bottom row), AXL C-terminus staining remained high in 
the on-treatment tumor biopsy, and tumor AXL ectodomain 
increased substantially ( 
Fig. 2C 
). This evidence suggests that 
MAPKi-induced decrease in plasma RTK does not refl
 ect 
decreased AXL expression in the tumor, but rather decreased 
release of the AXL ectodomain from the tumor. 
 
 
Circulating tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EV), 
including exosomes, can also be detected in patients, and sur-
face proteins on such vesicles often correlate with membrane 
protein levels on the tumor ( 
Fig. 2D 
; ref.  
24 
). We examined 
whether changes in EV RTK levels could also explain the 
posttreatment decrease in circulating RTKs seen for patient 
#4. Using the recently developed nPLEX (nanoplasmonic exo-
some) assay to sensitively detect surface RTK ectodomains on 
EVs ( 
24 
), we found that these EVs did not explain the overall 
circulating RTK decrease ( 
Fig. 2E 
; Supplementary Fig. S2C). 
In fact, EV AXL and MET ectodomain levels increased with 
MAPKi in patient #4, which is consistent with the observed 
tumor histology ( 
Fig. 2C 
) and likely refl
 ects intact RTK ecto-
domain on the tumor cell surfaces. In sum, these data demon-
strate the divergence between the levels of circulating, soluble 
RTKs, and RTK levels on cancer cell membranes following 
MAPKi in patients: Decreased circulating RTK levels do not 
simply refl
 ect decreased expression in the tumor. 
 
We next sought to understand how MEKi affects AXL 
surface levels and signaling activity in cultured melanoma 
(LOX-IMVI) and TNBC (MDA-MB-231) cells. Consistent with 
the clinical melanoma fi
 ndings, we observed that although 
MEKi reduced total supernatant RTK for both cell lines ( 
Fig. 
1A 
), these changes did not correlate with exosomal RTK 
levels within that same supernatant ( 
Fig. 2F and G 
). MEKi 
did not affect exosome production or size in MDA-MB-231 
(Supplementary Fig. S2D), and previously discussed control 
experiments revealed that the majority of supernatant MET 
and AXL from MDA-MB-231 and LOX-IMVI cell culture was 
not exosome-anchored (Supplementary Fig. S1B). We next 
examined how MEKi infl
 uenced protein levels on the cell sur-
face and lysate. Changes in both surface and phosphorylated 
AXL were detectable by 3 hours after treatment and further 
increased by 24 hours (Supplementary Fig. S2E). However, 
MEKi did not similarly increase RNA levels of AXL (Sup-
plementary Fig. S2F and S2G), suggesting that surface AXL 
changes are not simply due to transcriptional regulation. 
 
For a dose-response analysis of MEKi-induced AXL effects, 
we treated LOX-IMVI ( 
Fig. 2H and I 
) and MDA-MB-231 ( 
Fig. 
2J and K

readout of proximal MEKi effi
 cacy; monitored cell survival; 
measured supernatant RTK ectodomain levels; and assessed 
levels of full-length intact AXL in cell lysates using anti-
bodies targeted to either the ectodomain (N-terminus) or the 
intracellular domain (C-terminus; also Supplementary Fig. 
S2H and S2I). Reduction of supernatant RTK correlated with 
pERK1/2 decrease and anticorrelated with lysate levels of full-
length AXL, which increased. Particularly with U0126 treat-
ment, coordinated changes in pERK1/2, supernatant RTK, 
and lysate AXL all were observable at lower MEKi concentra-
tions that did not substantially affect cell growth, therefore 
suggesting that the RTK changes are not directly caused by 
cell death and/or apoptosis processes. 
 
To parallel the clinical and  
in vitro 
 observations, we next 
tested whether MEKi similarly increased tumor AXL in a 
TNBC xenograft model. In association with our data that 
circulating RTK levels decreased substantially with MEKi 
( 
Fig. 1D 
), we observed that MEKi concomitantly increased 
AXL in the primary tumor, particularly at tumor edges ( 
Fig. 
2L and M 
). Overall, MEKi-induced reduction in extracellular 
soluble RTKs corresponds with a contrasting accumulation 
on the membranes of cells and exosomes, with corresponding 
increases in AXL phosphorylation. 
 
 
 
AXL Mediates MEKi Resistance, and Co-treatment 
with AXLi Synergistically Reduces Tumor Growth 
and Metastasis, and Extends Survival in Mice 
 
We next asked how increased RTK surface accumulation 
following MEKi relates to overall drug response. Across 11 
cancer cell lines, we observed a signifi
 cant correlation between 
MEKi resistance and surface changes in MET and AXL: cells 
showing RTK accumulation following MEKi were insensitive 
to MEKi as measured by proliferation across a dose response 
( 
Fig. 3A and B 
). From these data, we hypothesized that 
MEKi-induced AXL upregulation would also correlate with 
synergistic response to combined MEKi/AXLi treatment. To 
test this, we quantifi
 ed MEKi/AXLi synergistic response using 
a model of Bliss independence across 10 cell lines and cor-
related the results to changes in surface AXL (Supplementary 
Fig. S3A–S3C). Consistent with our model, cell lines display-
ing synergistic responses to combined AXLi/MEKi treat-
ment also showed corresponding upregulation of surface 
AXL following MEKi, in comparison with cell lines display-
ing non-synergistic responses ( 
Fig. 3C 
; Supplementary Fig. 
S3C). Notably, cell lines displaying synergistic response were 
also enriched for  
RAS 
 mutation, which is possibly related 
to a decreased reliance on signaling through proteolytically 
shed EGF ligands for MAPK activity, and which is clinically 
relevant due to the frequent assessment of  
RAS 
 mutation in 
patient tumors ( 
Fig. 3C 
; Supplementary Fig. S3D). Indeed, 
 
RAS 
-mutant MDA-MB-231 cells, among others, were resist-
ant to treatment with an anti-EGFR antibody that blocks 
ligand binding (mAb225, nonhumanized cetuximab; Supple-
mentary Fig. S3E), and  
KRAS mutation is a contraindication 
for cetuximab therapy in the colorectal cancer setting due to 
lack of effi
 cacy in those patients ( 
25 
). 
 
 
We next tested the synergistic effi
 cacy of dual MEKi/AXLi 
treatment in two mouse xenograft models, using cancer cell 
lines that showed increased surface AXL following MEKi. First, 
we used orthotopic TNBC xenografts using the highly lung-
metastatic derivative of MDA-MB-231, LM2. Combined MEKi/
AXLi treatment reduced both tumor growth ( 
Fig. 3D 
) and 
metastasis ( 
Fig. 3E 
) more than either treatment alone, with 
signifi
 cant superadditive synergistic effects in tumor growth 
reduction ( 
P 
 
 = 
 0.015; two-way ANOVA interaction term;  
n 
 
 ≥ 
 
7). In melanoma LOX-IMVI xenografts, we hypothesized that 
MEKi  
+ 
 BRAFi (trametinib  
+ 
 vemurafenib) combined with the 
AXL inhibitor R428 (AXLi) might extend PFS by compensating 
for drug resistance arising via AXL-mediated bypass signaling. 
Using an  
in vitro 
 proliferation/cytotoxicity assay, AXLi combined 
with either MEKi or BRAFi showed synergistic effects in LOX-
IMVI (Supplementary Fig. S3F). In the LOX-IMVI xenograft, 
the addition of AXLi to the BRAFi/MEKi treatment regimen 
led to an enhanced initial tumor response ( 
Fig. 3F 
), delayed 
tumor recurrence after the initial treatment course ended ( 
Fig. 
3G 
), and extended median overall survival by roughly 50% more 
than MAPKi treatment alone ( 
Fig. 3H 
). In contrast, AXLi treat-
ment by itself had no signifi
 cant impact on overall survival, thus 
demonstrating that the interaction between MAPKi and AXLi is 
synergistic ( 
Fig. 3H 
). Overall, these results provide evidence that 
AXL mediates bypass signaling in response to BRAFi/MEKi 
treatment, contributes to drug resistance, and is therapeutically 
targetable using combination treatment regimens. 
 
 
 
MEKi-Induced AXL and MET Upregulation 
Is Consistent with Decreased Proteolytic 
Receptor Shedding 
 
We next investigated the mechanism by which AXL and MET 
accumulate on the cell surface following MEKi, while simulta-
neously decreasing levels in the supernatant and in circulation. 
We fi
 rst took a proteomic approach to look for global patterns 
in how the tumor-derived extracellular proteome changes in 
response to targeted kinase inhibitor treatment, using antibody 
microarrays to screen 1,000 proteins for differential superna-
tant accumulation following MEKi in the MDA-MB-231 TNBC 
cell line. Gene set enrichment analysis ( 
26 
) of the  
∼ 
200 proteins 
exhibiting signifi
 cantly altered levels in the supernatant indi-
cated that MEKi reduced transmembrane receptor ectodomain 
abundance ( 
Fig. 4A 
) while increasing secreted (not proteo-
lytically shed) cytokine levels (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Among 
proteins that were depleted with MEKi from the supernatant, 
the top-ranked “transmembrane receptor activity” gene set ( 
Fig. 
4A 
) comprised various known sheddase substrates, including 
amyloid precursor protein (APP; ref.  
27 
) and low-density lipo-
protein receptor (LDLR; ref.  
28 
). These results combined with 
the signifi
 cantly decreased supernatant accumulation of RTKs, 
including known sheddase substrates MET and HER4 ( 
Fig. 1A 
and B 
), collectively implicate reduced proteolytic activity as a 
potentially key effect of MEKi. 
 
 
We next compared the supernatant effects of MEKi with 
broad-spectrum MPi using batimastat (BB94) and found 
similar patterns of widely decreased sheddase substrates 
amphiregulin (AREG), heparin-binding epidermal growth fac-
tor (HBEGF), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), and 
AXL following inhibitor treatment ( 
Fig. 4B 
). AREG, HBEGF, 
and TNFR1 have been largely associated with ADAM17 cleav-
age ( 
13, 17 
), but all may also be shed by ADAM10 depending 
on the context ( 
15, 29–32 
). Reduced sheddase substrate accu-
mulation was not an exclusive effect of direct MEKi: Among 19 
clinical and preclinical inhibitors targeting diverse signaling

pathways and RTKs, roughly 80% (15/19) inhibited substrate 
accumulation to some degree. Nonetheless, MEKi exhibited 
some of the strongest effects ( 
Fig. 4B 
). p38, PI3K, and c-JUN 
N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitors also signifi
 cantly reduced 
sheddase-substrate accumulation, consistent with previous 
reports describing their effects on ADAM activity ( 
15, 33 
). In 
contrast with supernatant decreases, surface levels of shed-
dase substrates AXL and TNFR1 correspondingly increased 
in response to several other inhibitors, but most signifi
 cantly 
with MPi and MEKi (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Kinetics of sur-
face and phosphorylated AXL following MPi (Supplementary 
Fig. S4C) closely resembled MEKi changes (Supplementary 
Fig. S2D), with observable increases by 3 hours after treatment 
and continued accumulation by 24 hours. To further compare 
the effects of MEKi and MPi, we profi
 led gene expression 
changes using RNA microarrays following either of the two 
treatments. Results show substantial overlap in the transcrip-
tional responses arising from MEKi and MPi, suggesting a 
shared mechanism of action ( 
Fig. 4C 
; Supplementary Fig. 
S4D). However, gene set enrichment analysis indicated that 
MEKi, but not MPi, induced growth arrest (Supplementary 
Fig. S4E); in fact, MPi did not elicit any signifi
 cant gene set 
enrichment. Overall, these results show that reduced metallo-
proteinase activity is a surprisingly prominent effect of MEKi. 
Furthermore, these data implicate MAPK signaling as one of 
the key pathways broadly regulating supernatant sheddase-
substrate accumulation, with effects similar to those seen 
when proteolytic shedding is directly inhibited.

Drug Resistance via Reduced RTK Shedding
RESEARCH ARTICLE
 
We next compared the effects of MPi and MEKi on RTK 
changes in levels in cell lysate, cell surface, and exosomes. 
Focusing on RTKs and key sheddase substrates identifi
 ed in 
the Ab microarray, we fi
 rst analyzed changes in surface levels 
of proteins ( 
Fig. 4D 
). In two TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 
and MDA-MB-157), we measured a panel of 18 sheddase sub-
strates on the cell surface in response to MPi and MEKi, and 
found signifi
 cant correlation between changes with MEKi 
compared with MPi (Pearson’
s correlation  
= 
 0.56;  
P 
 
 = 
 0.0003, 
two-tailed  
t test). Results show AXL as one of the most sig-
nifi
 cantly upregulated membrane proteins ( 
Fig. 4D 
). Across 
a panel of 12 cell lines, we observed a modest yet statistically 
signifi
 cant correlation between changes in surface AXL and 
MET in response to either MEKi or MPi, such that cells 
are more likely to exhibit increased surface AXL or MET 
following MEKi if they also showed increased levels follow-
ing MPi (Supplementary Fig. S4F). Gene expression helps 
explains why some sheddase substrates actually decrease on 
the cell surface following MPi; for example,  
HBEGF 
 and 
 
AREG 
 expression decreases following BB94 treatment, and 
their levels correspondingly decrease on the cell surface (Sup-
plementary Fig. S4G). In contrast, AXL expression does not 
signifi
 cantly change with either MPi or MEKi, and in LOX-
IMVI ( 
Fig. 4E 
) and MDA-MB-231 cells ( 
Fig. 4F 
), treatment 
with both MPi and MEKi signifi
 cantly increases levels of full-
length intact lysate AXL (see Supplementary Fig. S4H–S4I for 
confi
 rming pERK reduction). Similarly, we found increased 
intact AXL levels in CD63 
 
+  
 exosomes isolated from superna-
tant of the same cells ( 
Fig. 4G 
). To confi
 rm the hypothesis 
that this is due to changes in AXL proteolysis, we measured 
levels of ectodomain AXL receptor fragment in the superna-
tant of treated cells. Indeed, MPi and MEKi both decreased 
the accumulation of an AXL ectodomain fragment in the 
supernatant ( 
Fig. 4H 
), and full-length intact AXL protein 
was not detectable to any similar degree compared with 
the ectodomain fragment in the supernatant ( 
Fig. 4H 
). No 
substantial increases in cell death, apoptosis, or autophagy 
were observed with BB94 or PD325901 at the concentrations 
tested, suggesting these processes are not involved in the AXL 
phenotype described above (Supplementary Fig. S4J). Taken 
together, these data provide further evidence that MEKi 
effects on RTK processing are highly consistent with reduced 
proteolysis by metalloproteinases. 
 
To more broadly assess the impact of direct MPi on RTK 
signaling, we next examined MPi-induced changes in total, 
phosphorylated, and supernatant RTK levels across a panel of 
19 diverse cell lines. MPi widely decreased AXL, MET, HER2, 
and HER4 in the supernatant, and increased total RTK and 
pRTK levels in many cases, most signifi
 cantly and consist-
ently for AXL and MET ( 
Fig. 4I 
; Supplementary Fig. S4K and 
S4L). Overall, these data show that proteolytic RTK shedding 
substantially affects RTK levels and signaling in many cells, 
especially for AXL. 
 
 
 
MPi and MEKi Cause AXL-Dependent Bypass 
JNK/cJUN Signaling 
 
We next tested how AXL accumulation after MEKi or MPi 
leads to corresponding changes in downstream signaling 
events. At the RTK level, MEKi and MPi increase coimmuno-
precipitation of AXL with MET and HER2, which has been 
associated with RTK colocalization, signaling cross-talk, 
and AXL transactivation (Supplementary Fig. S5A; ref.  
34 
). 
Downstream of receptor signaling, we found that although 
MEKi reduced pERK, it increased phosphorylation in other 
signaling pathways (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Previous 
reports have implicated signaling of JNK and its substrate 
cJUN in MAPKi resistance ( 
35 
), and here we found p-cJUN 
consistently increased with MEKi treatment more than 5 
other canonical signaling pathways averaged across 8 cell 
lines; pAKT was also consistently elevated (Supplementary 
Fig. S1A). In response to MPi, JNK and cJUN phosphoryla-
tion were among the strongest correlates with fl
 uctuating 
surface AXL and pAXL levels compared with 21 other signal-
ing measurements across 13 cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 
S5B and S5C), suggesting that accumulation of cell surface 
AXL following MPi leads to increased AXL phosphorylation 
and downstream signaling through the JNK/cJUN pathway. 
To test whether the observed JNK/cJUN signaling in fact 
depends on AXL activity, we monitored pJNK following MPi 
or MEKi in the presence or absence of various AXL perturba-
tions. After 2-hour MPi treatment, a compensatory increase in 
phosphorylation occurs more in pJNK than in four other key 
phosphoproteins, and this increase can be blocked by cotreat-
ment with AXLi using R428 (Supplementary Fig. S5D). After 
3-hour treatment with either MPi or MEKi, we found that the 
compensatory increase in pJNK can be eliminated by siRNA 
targeting either AXL or, to a lesser extent, MET ( 
Fig. 5 
A; siRNA 
validation Supplementary Fig. S5E). By 24 hours after treat-
ment, compensatory increases in p-cJUN and pAKT are like-
wise blocked by cotreatment with AXLi using R428 ( 
Fig. 5B 
and C 
). Compensatory JNK signaling in response to MAPKi 
leads to a synergistic response to dual JNK and MAPK inhibi-
tion ( 
35 
), and our data suggest that sheddase activity is a key 
feedback component driving this synergistic interaction. To 
test this model, we measured the degree of drug synergy as 
a response to combination MAPKi and JNKi treatment, in 
the presence or absence of MPi, and found that the degree of 
synergy between JNKi and MAPKi is strongly reduced in the 
absence of metalloproteinase activity (Supplementary Fig. 
S5F and S5G). 
 
 
 
 
MPi Drives AXL-Dependent Cell Proliferation and 
Blocks Response Synergy to Dual MEKi and AXLi 
 
We next evaluated the direct effect of MPi on cell prolif-
eration. MPi using BB94 caused a dose-dependent increase in 
cell growth in the absence of AXLi; however, in the presence 
of AXLi using R428, MPi actually caused a dose-dependent 
decrease in cell growth ( 
Fig. 5D 
). Furthermore, MPi increased 
the mitotic index of two TNBC cell lines, and this increase was 
also blocked by R428 ( 
Fig. 5E 
). Next, we directly tested the role 
of proteolytic activity in mediating MEKi/AXLi synergy. We 
treated cells with combinations of MEKi and AXLi in the pres-
ence or absence of MPi (using BB94), and then fi
 t the resulting 
cell growth measurements to a computational model of Loewe 
synergy, as done above with MAPKi and JNKi. This model fi
 ts 
the response data to a parameter  
α that quantifi
 es the degree 
to which drugs act in a synergistic, superadditive manner 
where the effect of both drugs combined is greater than what 
would be expected if the effects were independent and additive 
(simulated in  
Fig. 5F 
). This analysis revealed that synergistic

interactions between MEKi and AXLi were substantially 
reduced in the absence of metalloproteinase activity ( 
Fig. 5G 
and H 
), suggesting that proteolytic activity signifi
 cantly con-
tributes to AXL-dependent MEKi resistance. 
 
 
ADAM10 and ADAM17 Proteolytically Shed AXL 
to Downregulate Mitogenic Signaling Activity 
 
We next investigated which sheddases cleave AXL 
directly, focusing on ADAM17 as a principal sheddase and 
ADAM10 because AXL and MET shedding are closely cor-
related throughout our data, and MET is a previously known 
ADAM10 substrate ( 
15, 21, 36 
). ADAM17 and ADAM10 
knockdown using pooled siRNA (validation; Supplementary 
Fig. S6A) decreased supernatant AXL accumulation ( 
Fig. 
6A 
) and enhanced its levels on the cell surface in both MDA-
MB231 ( 
Fig. 6B 
) and MDA-MB157 cell lines (Supplementary 
Fig. S6B). Combined ADAM10 and ADAM17 knockdown 
yielded even greater effects, underscoring a role for both ( 
Fig. 
6A and B 
). Stable shRNA knockdown of either ADAM10 or 
ADAM17 also caused AXL accumulation on the surface of 
LOX-IMVI melanoma cells (Supplementary Fig. S6C and 
S6D) and decreased supernatant AXL accumulation (Supple-
mentary Fig. S6E). ADAM10 inhibition with the ADAM10-
selective inhibitor GI-254023X caused a dose-dependent 
decrease in supernatant AXL ectodomain ( 
Fig. 6C 
). Similarly, 
treatment with the specifi
 c ADAM10 inhibitor proA10 ( 
37 
) 
reduced supernatant AXL ( 
Fig. 6D 
). 
 
 
We examined the ability of recombinant ADAM10 to 
cleave purifi
 ed AXL protein and showed by Western blot that 
ADAM10 cleaves recombinant AXL ( 
Fig. 6E and F 
) in a dose-
dependent manner into ectodomain fragments of roughly the 
same size ( 
∼ 
85 kDa) as found in cell supernatant ( 
Fig. 4H 
). As 
a control, we confi
 rmed that these cleavage products were 
reduced in the presence of MPi ( 
Fig. 6G 
). We also confi
 rmed 
the ability of ADAM17 to cleave both recombinant AXL ( 
Fig. 
6G 
) and full-length AXL that had been immunopurifi
 ed from 
cell lysate (Supplementary Fig. S6F and S6G). 
 
Specifi
 c ADAM10 inhibition also affected cell prolifera-
tion in an AXL-dependent manner. Treatment with either 
GI-254023X or ADAM10 siRNA knockdown had minimal

MPi increases proliferation in an AXL-dependent manner and blocks MEKi/AXLi synergy. A,

P = 0.014, pooled  
t test,  
n = 2 reps/cond; 
siRNA validation, Supplementary Fig. S5E). B and C, representative Western blots (B) and quantifi

24-hour treatment with either MPi or MEKi, which is blocked in the presence of AXLi (*,  
P < 0.05, two-tailed  
t test,  
n ≥ 3). D, MPi using BB94 enhances pro-
liferation in the absence of R428, but decreases proliferation when R428 is present ( 
P = 0.02;  
n ≥ 4, two-tailed  
t test). E, BB94 increases mitotic index, 
measured by FACS cell-cycle analysis, which is blocked by AXLi using R428 (bars denote

treatments (G) were fi

Drug Resistance via Reduced RTK Shedding
RESEARCH ARTICLE
impact on cell growth in the absence of AXLi ( 
Fig. 6H 
), 
and stable ADAM10 knockdown using shRNA had mini-
mal impact on the growth of LOX-IMVI xenograft tumors 
(Supplementary Fig. S6H). However, when AXL signaling 
was inhibited by R428, ADAM10 inhibition was effective in 
reducing cell growth ( 
Fig. 6H 
). Similar trends were observed 
with ADAM17 siRNA knockdown ( 
Fig. 6H 
). These combined 
results are consistent with BB94 effects on proliferation ( 
Fig. 
5D and E 
) and demonstrate AXL upregulation as signifi
 -
cantly counteracting the antiproliferative capacity of metal-
loproteinase inhibitors. 
 
 
MEKi Dynamically Enhances Cell Surface TIMP1 
Association with ADAM10, Thus Reducing 
ADAM10 Activity and Causing Drug Resistance 
 
We next investigated the mechanism through which 
MAPKi decreases AXL shedding. MEKi signifi
 cantly reduced 
ADAM10 and ADAM17 catalytic activities in a live-cell assay 
(ref.  
38 
;  
Fig. 7A 
) without affecting their cell surface levels 
(Supplementary Fig. S7A), suggesting direct regulation of the 
protease activities themselves. As further evidence of direct 
protease regulation, ADAM17 phosphorylation at a site pre-
viously associated with activity ( 
33 
) decreased with MEKi 
(Supplementary Fig. S7B and S7C). The regulated binding 
of ADAMs with TIMPs, including TIMP1 and TIMP3, has 
been implicated as a mechanism for governing protease activ-
ity, and we next tested the role of TIMPs on AXL shedding. 
siRNA knockdown of TIMP1, but not TIMP3, mitigated 
MEKi-induced AXL accumulation on the surface ( 
Fig. 7B 
; 
knockdown validation; Supplementary Fig. S7D). In a mela-
noma xenograft model, we tested the  
in vivo 
 effect of TIMP1 
on AXL shedding by using a TIMP1-neutralizing antibody 
(T1-NAB) that binds TIMP1 and competitively prevents it 
from associating with proteases. Co-treatment with T1-NAB

Drug Resistance via Reduced RTK Shedding
RESEARCH ARTICLE
blocked tumor AXL accumulation after MAPKi treatment 
( 
Fig. 7C 
). Given that knockdown of TIMP3, which preferen-
tially inhibits ADAM17, had no effect on AXL shedding, and 
because TIMP1 preferentially inhibits ADAM10, our data 
suggest a more prominent role for TIMP1 and ADAM10 in 
regulating MEKi-driven AXL shedding. 
 
 
We found that MEKi continually enhanced the binding of 
TIMP1 to the cell surface from 30 minutes ( 
Fig. 7D 
) to 24 
hours (Supplementary Fig. S7E). In contrast, TIMP1 super-
natant levels actually declined after MEKi (Supplementary 
Fig. S7F), indicating enhanced TIMP1 surface levels do not 
simply refl
 ect enhanced TIMP1 secretion. We thus hypoth-
esized that MEKi induced a rapid change on the cell surface 
that enhanced TIMP1 binding. To test this, we fi
 rst treated 
cells for 5 minutes with MEKi, rinsed, and incubated cells on 
ice with a fi
 xed amount of fl
 uorescently tagged recombinant 
TIMP1 (rTIMP1-fl
 uor). MEKi enhanced rTIMP1-fl
 uor bind-
ing to the cell surface by nearly 50% ( 
Fig. 7E 
), supporting the 
idea that MEKi treatment leads to increased accumulation of 
TIMP1 on the cell surface. 
 
We next evaluated the role of ADAM10 in regulating MEKi-
driven TIMP1 cell surface accumulation. Using siRNA, we 
found that TIMP1 accumulation on the cell surface was depend-
ent upon ADAM10 expression (Supplementary Fig. S7G; 
knockdown validation in Supplementary Fig. S6A). To directly 
observe interaction between TIMP1 and ADAM10, we over-
expressed transgenic HA-tagged ADAM10 by 2-fold (Sup-
plementary Fig. S7H), treated cells for 5 minutes with MEKi, 
rinsed, and again incubated cells on ice with a fi
 xed amount of 
rTIMP1-fl
 uor. Proteins associating with ADAM10 were coim-
munopurifi
 ed (co-IP) using ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl 
succinate) (EGS) 
 cross-linking and anti-HA agarose resin. To 
sensitively detect rTIMP1-fl
 uor co-IP, bulk immunoprecipi-
tate was analyzed by fl
 uorometry and found to exhibit detect-
able rTIMP1 fl
 uorescence only after MEKi ( 
Fig. 7F 
), further 
suggesting that MEKi induces ADAM10-driven cell surface 
TIMP1 accumulation. 
 
We then investigated how MEKi dynamically infl
 uences 
interactions between ADAM10 and TIMP1. ADAM10 and 
ADAM17 dimerization has been associated with direct activ-
ity regulation ( 
39, 40 
), and we hypothesized that MEKi elic-
ited increased ADAM10 dimerization and association with 
TIMP1. Previously, immunoblots of EGS–cross-linked lysate 
have shown ADAM10 forms a dimerization band at roughly 
120 kDa ( 
39 
), and here we found that this band increases 
with MEKi and coimmunostains for TIMP1 ( 
Fig. 7G and H 
), 
indicating TIMP1–ADAM10 interaction. Thus, MEKi broadly 
reduces proteolytic shedding by enhanced TIMP1 association 
with ADAM10, negatively regulating its activity. 
 
We next examined the role of TIMP1 in infl
 uencing the 
therapeutic response to MAPKi. We co-treated cells with 
T1-NAB and either MEKi or BRAFi. Although T1-NAB had 
no detectable effect on cell growth in the absence of MAPKi, 
it enhanced MAPKi sensitivity by up to 50% ( 
Fig. 7I 
; Sup-
plementary Fig. S7I). For more clinical relevance, we next 
examined the effect of T1-NAB cotreatment in a melanoma 
xenograft model undergoing a combined MEKi/BRAFi inhib-
itor regimen similar to those used in the clinic. T1-NAB 
treatment alone did not signifi
 cantly reduce tumor growth 
( 
Fig. 7J 
;  
P 
 
 = 0.56, two-way ANOVA-independent effect term, 
total  
n 
 
 = 
 46). In contrast, T1-NAB signifi
 cantly enhanced the 
ability of MEKi/BRAFi to reduce tumor size by an additional 
70% ( 
Fig. 7J 
; note log-scale). Furthermore, T1-NAB extended 
the time to tumor recurrence after MEKi/BRAFi treatment 
had ended ( 
Fig. 7K 
). Recurrent outgrown tumors from this 
study did not exhibit altered AXL levels (Supplementary 
Fig. S7J), which is in contrast to tumors analyzed while on 
drug treatment ( 
Fig. 7C 
), and suggests that effects on AXL 
shedding largely reverted during the roughly 3 weeks after 
treatment ended. Nevertheless, these results provide evidence 
that reduced proteolytic AXL shedding via TIMP1 association 
leads to blunted MAPKi effi
 cacy. 
 
 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
We have elucidated a new targetable mechanism of bypass 
cancer cell signaling with implications for the design and 
monitoring of cancer therapies ( 
Fig. 7L 
). Inhibition of mul-
tiple signaling pathways, particularly ERK signaling through 
MEK1/2, reduces proteolytic RTK shedding and leads to 
enhanced mitogenic signaling through bypass kinase path-
ways including JNK. Numerous examples of increased RTK 
signaling activity have been observed following targeted 
kinase inhibitor treatment, often with little mechanistic 
explanation outside of transcriptional upregulation ( 
1, 4, 
5, 41 
). MEK and PI3K kinase inhibitions have been shown 
to enhance the signaling of sheddase substrates, including 
HER2 ( 
3, 5 
) and AXL ( 
1, 42 
), and we show here that inhibi-
tion of MEK, BRAF, and, to some extent, PI3K, p38, and JNK 
(as in  
Fig. 4B 
) reduces RTK shedding. The direct inhibition 
of RTKs also gives rise to bypass signaling. For example, 
enhanced AXL signaling mediates resistance to the EGFR/
HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, even in the absence of AXL tran-
scriptional upregulation ( 
4 
). Although transcriptional and 
chromosomal reprogramming affects bypass signaling ( 
2 
), 
these processes often fail to fully explain signaling network 
dynamics following drug treatment; this is especially true 
for AXL, which often exhibits little transcriptional upregula-
tion despite sharply enhanced activity (1, 4). Here, we offer 
reduced proteolytic RTK shedding as a likely explanatory 
mechanism. 
 
The promiscuous nature of metalloproteinases has made 
it diffi
 cult to anticipate the overall effects of perturbing their 
activities, especially in response to kinase inhibition ( 
17, 19 
). 
Ectodomain shedding can be regulated through substrate-
specifi
 c pathways ( 
43 
), and in this work, we fi
 nd that sub-
strate-specifi
 c regulation, for example through differential 
substrate accumulation on the cell surface, can be explained 
only partially by transcriptional regulation (Supplementary 
Fig. S4G). Nonetheless, substantial evidence suggests that 
MEKi inhibits ADAM catalytic activities themselves ( 
Fig. 7 
), 
and we highlight an unappreciated role for TIMP1 associa-
tion in this context. Consequently, MEKi essentially leads to 
a global reduction of ectodomain shedding across a wide 
range of substrates ( 
Figs. 1 and 4A). Sheddase substrates, 
such as EGF ligands, have been studied for their role in auto-
crine growth factor signaling and have motivated protease 
inhibitor development (particularly targeting ADAM10 and 
ADAM17) for clinical use ( 
44 
). This work suggests that past 
metalloproteinase inhibitor clinical trials may have failed

partly due to unanticipated compensatory signaling feedback 
from unshed RTKs. 
 
In general, we fi
 nd that AXL and MET shedding down-
regulates signaling activity by limiting the accumulation of 
full-length, signaling-competent RTK on the cell surface. 
Ligand-dependent receptor activation is an important signal-
ing feature, particularly in the context of receptor shedding 
( 
15 
), and is relevant for future studies. Nonetheless, AXL and 
the other RTKs studied here exhibit signifi
 cant ligand-inde-
pendent activity ( 
34, 41 
), which amplifi
 es as they accumulate 
on the cell surface following protease downregulation. Clini-
cally, AXL upregulation often occurs without apparent dys-
regulation of its ligand GAS6, and roughly half of observed 
AXL bypass signaling acts independently of GAS6 in drug-
resistant cell lines ( 
41 
). Receptor shedding also results in the 
generation of inhibitory “decoy” receptors that both compete 
for binding of free extracellular ligand and block cell-surface 
dimerization between signaling-competent receptors; decoy 
functions have been therapeutically exploited for multiple 
receptors, including MET ( 
45 
) and AXL ( 
46 
). Here, we show 
that kinase inhibition simultaneously increases full-length 
RTK on the cell surface while decreasing decoy receptor levels 
in the extracellular supernatant or in circulation. 
 
Diminished RTK shedding likely complements other 
bypass signaling mechanisms. Many RTKs reported as tran-
scriptionally upregulated in response to kinase inhibition are 
themselves sheddase substrates, including PDGFR 
β 
 ( 
1, 8 
), 
VEGFR2 ( 
1 
), and CD44 ( 
47 
). In the context of MAPKi, AXL 
repeatedly surfaces in genome-wide screens as a top candidate 
for rescuing drug sensitivity upon transgenic overexpression 
( 
48 
). Reduced RTK shedding has the potential to amplify 
the effects of transcriptional upregulation by increasing the 
fraction of total RTK that remains intact on the cell sur-
face. Within the tumor microenvironment, stromal-derived 
growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix contribute 
to drug resistance ( 
20, 49–52 
). Here, we fi
 nd that receptors 
affected by reduced RTK shedding are also implicated in 
tumor–stroma ligand interactions, with a prominent example 
being MET activation by stromal-derived HGF ( 
51 
). Of note, 
extracellular HGF and GAS6 release occurs through secre-
tion rather than metalloproteinase shedding. Consequently, 
reduced RTK shedding has the capacity to amplify prosur-
vival and prometastatic tumor–stroma interactions, and pre-
vious work has demonstrated RTK shedding as a modifi
 er of 
ligand-dependent receptor activation ( 
15 
). 
 
The ability to assess RTK shedding in cancer patients using 
relevant biomarkers is essential for effi
 cient clinical transla-
tion. A substantial proportion of molecular cancer diagnostics 
focuses on gene expression and/or genetic mutation analysis 
of tumors, is dependent on the presence of an accessible tumor, 
and is limited by factors such as tumor heterogeneity and 
post-translational regulation. We present RTK proteolysis as 
a mechanistic explanation for the discordance between gene 
expression and signaling activity, and provide evidence that 
receptor shedding can be noninvasively monitored in clini-
cal samples following drug treatment. Although promising, 
the small cohort of patient samples examined here should 
be expanded to a study of both larger cohorts and a broader 
panel of sheddase substrates, such as adhesion receptors, 
cytokines, and cytokine receptors. Importantly, RTK proteolysis 
may also refl
 ect drug toxicity in addition to drug effi
 cacy, and 
multiple physiologic factors may infl
 uence altered circulat-
ing RTK levels. For instance, foretinib has been observed to 
cause elevated circulating MET in patients ( 
53 
), which may 
be explained by its common liver toxicity (high aspartate and 
alanine transaminases 
) and the corresponding association of 
hepatotoxicity with elevated MET shedding ( 
54 
). Changes may 
also be related to altered gene expression and known vascular 
effects of foretinib, including hypertension. Nonetheless, the 
value of a biomarker that can predict resistance and shed light 
on a next potential line of therapy cannot be underestimated. 
Ultimately, circulating RTKs hold the potential to stand alone 
and to complement other diagnostic biomarkers in guiding 
targeted combination therapies, monitoring drug response, 
and noninvasively detecting the emergence of drug resistance.

In Vivo Tumor Growth and Metastasis Assays 
 
All animal experiments and husbandry were approved by the MIT 
Division of Comparative Medicine in accordance with guidelines 
of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of MIT. For 
orthotopic mammary transplant assays, 6-week-old female NOD/
SCID-gamma mice (JAX) were anesthetized by i.p. injection of 125 to 
250 mg/kg body weight of Avertin (reconstituted in PBS), followed 
by i.p. injection of 100  
μ 
L of 12  
μ 
g/mL buprenorphine for analgesia. 
A small incision was made on the right fl
 ank, and 2.5 × 10 
5  MDA-
MB-231-LM2 cells in 25  
μ 
L of Hank’
s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) 
were injected into the right #4 fat pad using a 25- 
μ 
L Hamilton syringe. 
Mice received three additional i.p. injections of 100  
μ 
L of 12  
μ 
g/mL 
buprenorphine at 12-hour intervals following the surgery. Initial sam-
ple size was chosen based on previously published experiments with 
MDA-MB-231-LM2 xenograft models ( 
55 
), as well as previously pub-
lished data with the MEK and AXL drugs of interest ( 
56, 57 
). Twenty 
days after surgery, when tumor size was palpable, mice were ranked by 
tumor size and were semirandomly divided into four groups of equal 
distribution in tumor size. Groups received one of four different drug 
treatments once daily for 21 days by oral gavage: vehicle (10% DMSO  
+ 
 
0.5% methylcellulose  
+ 
 0.2% tween-80 in water), AXL inhibitor R428 at 
30 mg/kg, PD0325901 at 1 mg/kg, or a combination of both R428 at 
30 mg/kg and PD0325901 at 1 mg/kg. Animals were sacrifi
 ced at the 
predetermined time of 21 days following initiation of drug treatment. 
 
For the xenograft melanoma experiment, 7-week-old female 
athymic nude mice (Taconic) were injected with 1  
× 10 
6 
 LOX-IMVI 
cells in 1:1 Matrigel:HBSS subcutaneously in each fl
 ank ( 
58 
). Seven 
days after cell injection, tumors were measured by calipers, and mice 
were ranked by tumor size and semirandomly divided into 6 groups 
of equal distribution in tumor size, with 10 mice per group. Groups 
received one of four different drug treatments once daily for 14 days 
by oral gavage: vehicle (10% DMSO  
+ 
 0.5% methylcellulose  
+ 
 0.2% 
Tween-80 in water), AXL inhibitor R428 at 30 mg/kg, PD0325901 
at 1 mg/kg and vemurafi
 nib at 10 mg/kg, or a combination of R428 
at 30 mg/kg, PD0325901 at 1 mg/kg, and vemurafi
 nib at 10 mg/kg. 
To study the role of TIMP1 in resistance to MAPKi, mice were 
treated with a TIMP1-neutralizing antibody (AbD Serotec/Biorad) at 
32 mg/kg i.p. ( 
59 
) daily for 3 days prior to starting drug treatment and 
then every second day during drug treatment. Mice were sacrifi
 ced 
when overall tumor burden reached more than 3 cm in diameter. 
Tumor size measurements, tissue processing, staining of tumors, 
and exclusion criteria can be found in Supplementary Experimental 
Procedures.
