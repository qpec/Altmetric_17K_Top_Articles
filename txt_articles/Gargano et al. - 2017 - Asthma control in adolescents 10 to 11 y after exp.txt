Background: Little is known about asthma control in ado-
lescents who were exposed to the World Trade Center (WTC) 
attacks of 11 September 2001 and diagnosed with asthma 
after 9/11. This report examines asthma and asthma control 
10–11 y after 9/11 among exposed adolescents.
Methods: The WTC Health Registry adolescent Wave 3 survey 
(2011–2012) collected data on asthma diagnosed by a physician 
after 11 September 2001, extent of asthma control based on 
modified National Asthma Education and Prevention Program 
criteria, probable mental health conditions, and behavior prob-
lems. Parents reported healthcare needs and 9/11-exposures. 
Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between 
asthma and level of asthma control and 9/11-exposure, mental 
health and behavioral problems, and unmet healthcare needs.
results: Poorly/very poorly controlled asthma was sig-
nificantly associated with a household income of ≤$75,000 
(adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 3.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): 
1.1–8.8), having unmet healthcare needs (AOR: 6.2; 95% CI: 
1.4–27.1), and screening positive for at least one mental health 
condition (AOR: 5.0; 95% CI: 1.4–17.7), but not with behavioral 
problems. The impact of having at least one mental health 
condition on the level of asthma control was substantially 
greater in females than in males.
conclusions: Comprehensive care of post-9/11 asthma 
in adolescents should include management of mental health-
related comorbidities.
t
he collapse and burning of the World Trade Center (WTC) 
towers on 11 September 2001 (9/11) exposed hundreds 
of thousands of people to a complex mixture of dust, debris, 
and jet fuel combustion byproducts (1). It is estimated that 
over 25,000 persons in lower Manhattan developed asthma 
symptoms after exposure to the WTC terrorist attacks and the 
subsequent rescue and recovery efforts (1). In the years imme-
diately following 9/11, new-onset asthma rates were elevated 
among exposed adults and many of those affected continued 
to experience respiratory symptoms (i.e., coughing, shortness 
of breath) years later (1,2).
An estimated 25,000 children were living or attending 
school in lower Manhattan near the WTC on 9/11, and poten-
tially were in the path of the dust cloud of building debris and 
smoke after the collapse of the towers, as well as for several 
months following the attacks, and could have inhaled particu-
late matter and toxic substances (3,4). Associations between 
9/11-related exposures and both asthma diagnosis and per-
sistent respiratory symptoms among children and adoles-
cents have been documented (4–6). A previous report found 
that 2 to 3 y after 9/11, over half of children under 18 y of age 
who were enrolled in the World Trade Center Health Registry 
(Registry) reported new or worsening respiratory symptoms 
(53%), and 5.7% reported a post-9/11 diagnosis of asthma, 
both of which were associated with exposure to the dust cloud 
that resulted from the collapse of buildings on 9/11 (4). A sub-
sequent study of Registry enrollees under 18 y old found that 
respiratory symptoms persisted up to 7 y post-9/11 (5). The 
WTC Environmental Health Center which collected clinical 
data on a sample of children an average of 7.8 y after 9/11, 
reported new onset provider-diagnosed asthma in 21.4% of 
children, and found that dust cloud exposure was associated 
with pulmonary function abnormalities, such as isolated low 
forced vital capacity pattern and an obstructive pattern consis-
tent with asthma (6).
Although the association between asthma and 9/11-expo-
sure in children and adolescents has been documented, little is 
known about asthma control in this population. Large popu-
lation-based surveys consistently show that poor asthma con-
trol is common in many children with asthma (7,8). Asthma 
control is affected by many factors, including healthcare access 
(9,10), socioeconomic status (9,10), and comorbid mental 
health conditions (11–13).
It has been observed that adolescents with symptomatic 
asthma are more likely than adolescents without asthma to 
have lower perceived well-being, more negative behaviors, and 
a greater number of physical and mental health comorbidities 
(14). Several studies found that depression has been associated 
with uncontrolled asthma (11,12). In adults with 9/11-related 
asthma, having at least one mental health condition has been

associated with poorly controlled asthma (15). However, 
little is known about the association between mental health 
conditions and the level of asthma control especially among 
9/11-exposed adolescents.
Previous studies of adult Registry enrollees found that 
those with unmet healthcare needs are more likely to have 
severe mental health symptoms, comorbid mental and phys-
ical health problems, and have lower quality of life (1,16). 
Unmet healthcare needs among adolescents have been shown 
to be associated with poorer health status and functioning, 
including asthma control (17). Poorly controlled asthma has 
also been associated with unmet healthcare needs related 
to cost or access barriers (18), such as an inability to pay 
for asthma medications and not having access to asthma 
 
specialists (19).
The goal of this study was to evaluate asthma control 10–
11 y after 9/11 among Registry as children, and to determine 
whether poor asthma control is associated with specific factors 
including adolescent 9/11-exposure, adverse mental health, 
behavior problems, and unmet healthcare needs.
RESULTS
The study population was evenly split between males and 
females, 39.0% were 5–8 y old on 9/11, 54.3% were white, and 
approximately one-third (36.6%) reported a household income 
of $75,000 or less in 2010 (Table 1). Parents of 17 adolescents 
(4.4%) reported unmet healthcare needs for the child. Over 
half of parents reported their adolescent had witnessed one or 
more disturbing events on 9/11 (57.9%), 42.4% were reported 
to be in the dust cloud, 5.6% had sustained an injury, and 34.4% 
had a family exposure. Forty-eight adolescents (12.4%) had an 
abnormal/borderline Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire 
(SDQ) score, and 14.5% screened positive for at least one men-
tal health condition at Wave 3 (3.3% Post-traumatic Stress 
Disorder (PTSD); 6.9% depression; and 11.0% agoraphobia).
Prevalence of post-9/11 physician diagnosed asthma among 
adolescents is shown in Table 1, within each category of demo-
graphic and exposure variables. The overall prevalence was 
25.5%, and was significantly greater in males (31.6%) than in 
females (19.6%; P = 0.01). Asthma prevalence did not differ sig-
nificantly with age group, but was higher in African American 
(63.6%), Hispanic (39.0%), and Asian/other (24.1%) than in 
Caucasian adolescents (19.7%). Asthma was also significantly 
higher in adolescents from households with a 2010 income of 
≤$75,000 and those with parent report of unmet healthcare 
needs. Among the four 9/11-exposures measured, only dust 
cloud exposure was associated with asthma (P = 0.001).
Among the 100 adolescents with asthma, 23% had poorly/
very poorly controlled asthma (Table 2). Adolescents from 
households reporting a 2010 income of ≤$75,000 had a higher 
proportion of poorly/very poorly controlled asthma (34.1%) 
compared to adolescents from households with income greater 
than $75,000 (15.7%; P = 0.04). A significantly higher propor-
tion of adolescents with unmet healthcare needs had poorly/
very poorly controlled asthma (55.6%) when compared to 
those adolescents with no unmet healthcare needs (20.0%; 
P = 0.02). None of the 9/11-exposures or SDQ scores were 
associated with asthma control. Adolescents who screened 
positive for at least one mental health condition were more 
likely to have poorly/very poorly controlled asthma (50.0%) 
than adolescents with no mental health condition (19.3%; P = 
0.02) (Table 2).
Consistent with the definition of asthma control used in this 
analysis, most participants who were categorized as having 
poorly/very poorly controlled asthma reported wheezing or 
whistling in chest and sleep disturbances because of wheezing 
or whistling in the past 12 mo (Table 3). A similar trend was 
observed with reported asthma attacks; 69.6% of participants 
with poorly/very poorly controlled asthma reported hav-
ing had at least one asthma attack during the past year, com-
pared to 42.9% of those with controlled asthma (P = 0.004). 
Emergency room visits and hospitalizations for asthma within 
the preceding year were also much more common among 
those with poorly/very poorly controlled asthma (Table 3).
After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, gender, and dust 
cloud exposure, adolescents with asthma whose parents 
reported unmet healthcare needs were five times more likely 
to have poorly/very poorly controlled asthma (adjusted odds 
ratio (AOR): 5.2; 95% confidence internal (CI): 1.2–22.9) 
compared to adolescents whose parents reported no unmet 
healthcare needs. In both the unadjusted and adjusted analy-
sis, adolescents from households with an income of ≤$75,000 
were almost three times more likely to have poorly/very poorly 
controlled asthma (AOR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.1–8.2). Adolescents 
who screened positive for at least one mental health condition 
were six times more likely to have poorly/very poorly con-
trolled asthma (AOR: 6.1; 95% CI: 1.5–24.7) (Table 4). We fur-
ther investigated the increase seen in the AOR of mental health 
conditions predicting asthma control. After stratifying by gen-
der, the presence of at least one mental health condition had a 
higher point estimate of association with lack of asthma con-
trol among females (AOR: 9.1; 95% CI: 1.4–61.5) than males 
(AOR: 3.4; 95% CI: 0.4–28.7) (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Ten years after the 9/11 WTC terrorist attacks, among adoles-
cent Registry enrollees who responded to the Wave 3 survey 
and reported post-9/11 physician diagnosed asthma, almost 
one-fourth had poorly or very poorly controlled asthma. We 
found adolescents from lower income households had poorer 
asthma control compared with adolescents from higher 
income households, similar to other reports (9,10). Comorbid 
mental health conditions were also strongly associated with 
poor control. In addition, there was an association between 
poorly/very poorly controlled asthma and the adolescent hav-
ing unmet healthcare needs.
Asthma control associated with screening positive for at 
least one mental health condition, consistent with adult 9/11 
studies and non-9/11 related studies of children (11,12,15). 
Psychological comorbidity among 9/11-exposed adolescents 
with asthma may present particular challenges for asthma 
management. Comorbid anxiety or depressive disorders in

adolescents with asthma might have a significant impact on 
their ability to cope effectively with their asthma (11,12). 
Although the explanation for this relationship is unclear, it 
is conceivable that respiratory symptoms trigger or increase 
psychological distress, or that mental health symptoms worsen 
respiratory symptoms directly. Another possible mechanism is 
that mental health symptoms interfere with adherence to med-
ical treatment for respiratory symptoms. Studies have shown

Asthma control in WTC exposed youth         Articles
that adherence declines further in patients with asthma who are 
depressed (20,21). Our findings underscore the importance of 
integrating physical and psychological health care services for 
all adolescents; particularly those directly exposed to 9/11, and 
could be applicable to adolescents exposed to other disasters 
as well. One potential way to assist parents of adolescents with 
asthma could be in school-based programs. Where possible, 
schools should implement strategies similar to those recom-
mended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to 
address asthma, which include provision of appropriate men-
tal health services among other components of a coordinated 
school health program for students with asthma (22).
We found that the associations between having at least one 
mental health condition and poorly/very poorly controlled 
asthma differed between males and females. Studies exam-
ining adherence in the pediatric population have found no 
relationship between adherence and gender (23,24), although 
most studies did not account for the presence or absence of 
comorbid mental health condition. It is possible that a mental 
health condition in an adolescent girl has a more pronounced 
disabling effect than in a boy, increasing the likelihood of 
asthma control problems. Similar to other studies, we did find 
a higher proportion of females with at least one mental health 
issue compared to males (25,26). Studies of adolescents with 
cystic fibrosis found that females are more likely to have seri-
ous respiratory infections and shorter life expectancy, and that 
female patients are more likely to have mental health problems 
(27,28). Additionally, some studies have found that adolescent 
females report more physical health symptoms, psychologi-
cal symptoms and use more emotion-oriented and problem-
oriented coping strategies than adolescent males (29). Because 
coping styles may be associated with medication adherence; 
gender differences and coping skills need to be considered 
when assessing poorly controlled asthma.
A frequent correlate of low income is unmet healthcare 
needs. We found that adolescents with asthma whose parents 
reported unmet healthcare needs were five times more likely 
to have poorly/very poorly asthma compared to those adoles-
cents without unmet healthcare needs. This group with unmet 
healthcare needs is at significant risk for worsening symptoms 
and greater morbidity, and untreated health problems put chil-
dren at risk for developing lifelong chronic conditions (17). 
Factors related to low income are only one potential explana-
tion for unmet healthcare needs; others include parent mental 
health and demographic factors such as parent education (30). 
Additional outreach may be needed to educate parents on the 
WTC Health Program for responders and non-responder sur-
vivors as part of the federally funded James Zadroga Health 
and Compensation Act of 2010, which also includes a nation-
wide network of providers for affected persons living outside 
the New York City area (31). For an adolescent with persis-
tent asthma to receive appropriate care, several steps must 
occur. Asthma care is complex, from symptom presentation 
and recognition to medication adherence, and a failure at any 
step could lead to poor control. Unmet adolescent healthcare 
needs may result from parental attitudes and concerns about 
appropriate administration of asthma medicines and how to 
manage acute asthma attacks, which have been associated with 
the frequency of urgent care visits (a measure for uncontrolled 
asthma) for childhood asthma (32,33). Improved control could 
also generate substantial healthcare savings if asthma-related 
emergency room visits and hospitalizations, which were rela-
tively common among participants with poorly/very poorly-
controlled asthma, were prevented.
Limitations
Our data are limited by their self-reported nature; further, the 
low response rates to the adolescent and parent surveys and 
resulting small sample size reduced the power of our analy-
ses and precision of our effect estimates. Low response rates 
are a constant challenge in adolescent focused studies, and our 
response rate is comparable to that of other studies among ado-
lescents (34–36). A response bias may be present; while there 
was no significant difference in report of post-9/11 asthma at 
Wave 1 between those who completed Wave 3 and those who

did not; parents and adolescents who did not complete Wave 3 
were more likely to be non-white and to have lower household 
income. The accurate assessment of exposure-outcomes rela-
tionships is a critical challenge in 9/11-exposed populations. 
Because the event was a disaster with few immediate studies 
and exposure assessments, personal exposure cannot be recon-
structed completely.
Conclusions
Almost a quarter of adolescents with asthma had poorly or 
very poorly controlled asthma 10–11 y after 9/11. There were 
associations between unmet healthcare needs and comorbid 
mental health conditions and asthma control. These findings 
suggest that providers who care for adolescents with symptoms 
of post-9/11 asthma should be aware that asthma control may 
be particularly difficult to achieve if mental health symptoms 
are present, and that integration of mental and physical health-
care is crucial for adolescents affected by the 9/11 or other nat-
ural or manmade disasters.
METHODS
Study Population
Study subjects were drawn from the Registry, a longitudinal cohort of 
71,431 rescue and recovery workers, lower Manhattan residents liv-
ing south of Canal Street, students attending schools south of Canal 
Street, building occupants, and passersby south of Chambers Street 
on 11 September 2001 (1). Three Waves of data were gathered: base-
line (Wave 1, 2003–2004), Wave 2 (2006–07), and Wave 3 (2011–12). 
The present analysis is based on pediatric data obtained at Waves 1 
and 3. At Wave 1, parents completed questionnaires on behalf of 3,184 
children under age 18, providing information about the child’s health 
and 9/11-exposure. At Wave 3, parents of adolescent enrollees age 10 
to 17 completed an “adult” Wave 3 questionnaire that provided infor-
mation about their own emotional health as well as data on house-
hold income and the adolescent’s physical health and 9/11-exposures, 
while the adolescents completed a separate questionnaire about their 
behavior and physical and mental health to be returned in a sepa-
rate envelope for confidentiality. Multiple rounds of personalized 
paper survey mailings, monthly email and postcard reminders, and 
door-to-door home outreach visits were conducted to increase the 
response. Of the 1,341 adolescents still under 18 y of age at the time 
of the Wave 3 survey, a total of 491 (36%) adolescent surveys and 559 
(42%) parent surveys were returned. Adolescent enrollees who did 
not complete Wave 3 were similar to those who did with regard to age, 
gender, parent education, post-9/11 asthma, and all 9/11-exposures 
but were more likely to be African American or Hispanic, or have 
parents who reported a 2002 income of less than $50,000. Adolescent 
enrollees missing information on asthma (n = 80) and those missing 
a corresponding parent survey (n = 19) were excluded. This resulted 
in a final analytic sample of 392. The Registry protocol was approved 
by the institutional review boards of the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention and NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
Outcome Variable
The outcome of interest was asthma control among adolescents 
with asthma diagnosed after 11 September 2001. Asthma diagnosis 
was assessed at Wave 3 and defined as both parent and adolescent 
reporting that a physician (or other health professional) had told 
them the adolescent had asthma after 11 September 2001. Only those 
instances where both adolescent and parent reported this diagnosis 
were considered to have the outcome. We categorized study partici-
pants as having controlled, poorly, or very poorly controlled asthma 
based on modified criteria from the National Asthma Education 
and Prevention Program’s Third Expert Panel Report (37) (Table 5), 
which has been used in a previous Registry study on asthma control 
in adults (15). Participants were assigned to the most severe category 
in which any component was reported. For analysis, the poorly and 
very poorly controlled were collapsed into one category because of 
the small numbers in those categories.
Independent Variables
Unmet healthcare needs. At Wave 3, parents were asked: “During the 
last 12 months, was there ever a time when your adolescent needed 
health care for physical health problems, but did not receive it?”; a 
“yes” response indicated unmet healthcare needs. A similar question 
has been used to assess unmet mental healthcare needs among adults 
in the Registry and elsewhere (18,38).
Adolescent 9/11-exposure. For consistency purposes, measures of 
adolescent 9/11-exposures used in this study have been previously 
used by Hoven et al.(39) and the Registry in studies on the effects of 
9/11-exposure on the mental and physical health of children (4,5,40). 
Adolescent 9/11-exposures assessed included: (i) witnessing one or 
more disturbing events during and/or after the WTC attacks (airplane 
crashing into a tower, buildings collapsing, people running away from 
a cloud of smoke, or people being injured, killed, falling, or jumping 
from one of the towers), (ii) sustaining an injury as a result of the 
attacks (burn, broken bone, concussion, cut, sprain, or other injury), 
(iii) being caught in the dust cloud that resulted from the collapse of 
the WTC towers, or (iv) family exposure (having a family member 
(mother, father, sibling, grandparent, or any other family member) 
who was injured or killed in the attacks, or was in the WTC attack 
area and escaped unhurt). The first three exposure items were derived 
from the Wave 1 questionnaire; the fourth (family exposure) was 
derived from the Wave 3 parent questionnaire.
Adolescent behavior problems. Behavioral difficulties among ado-
lescents were assessed at Wave 3 using the adolescent-reported SDQ. 
The SDQ is a 25-question, validated, behavioral screening question-
naire that incorporates scales for conduct problems, hyperactivity, 
emotional symptoms, peer problems, and pro-social behavior (41,42). 
We summed items in the first four scales to arrive at a total score (0–
40) that is interpreted as a measure of emotional distress (41–43). Due 
to small numbers, we dichotomized this SDQ score into normal (0–
15) and abnormal/borderline (16–40) similar to other studies (40,43).
Adolescent mental health outcomes. Probable PTSD, depres-
sion, and agoraphobia were assessed on the Wave 3 adolescent sur-
vey using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC) 
Predictive Scales (DPS), as used in previous WTC publications on 
children (5,39). The assessment includes seven questions evaluat-
ing stress-related functioning during the past 4 wk; a scoring algo-
rithm was used to determine “impaired functioning” (39). The 
assessment also includes eight symptom questions to evaluate stress 
referencing 9/11-disaster related experiences. Probable PTSD was 
assumed if adolescents scored in the impaired functioning range, and

aParticipants were assigned to the most severe category in which any component was 
reported. bThis differs slightly from the EPR 3 definition, which specifies no interference 
with normal activity for well-controlled, some limitation for poorly-controlled, and 
extreme limitation for very poorly-controlled asthma. cThis differs slightly from the EPR 
3 definition, which specifies inhaler use ≤2 d/week for well-controlled, >2 d a week for 
poorly-controlled, and several times per day for very poorly-controlled asthma.

Asthma control in WTC exposed youth         Articles
answered “yes” to at least five of the eight symptom questions suggest-
ing  
re-experiencing, avoidance, or sense of a foreshortened future. 
Probable depression was measured using a nine-item scale from the 
DPS. Criteria for probable depression included a positive response 
to seven or more items and impaired function (39). Probable ago-
raphobia was measured using a six-item scale and criteria for prob-
able agoraphobia were a positive response to three or more items and 
impaired functioning (39). Adolescents who screened positive for at 
least one of the three mental health conditions were compared with 
adolescents who screened negative for all three due to small numbers.
Additional Variables
Asthma-related events and asthma-related healthcare seeking. 
At Wave 3, parents were asked in the last 12 mo if their adolescent 
had an episode of asthma or an asthma attack and how many times 
did their adolescent go to an emergency room or urgent care center 
because of asthma.
Respiratory symptoms. At Wave 3, adolescents were asked if they 
had wheezing or whistling in their chest in the last 12 mo and, if in the 
last 12 mo, how often has their sleep been disturbed due to wheezing 
or whistling (“never”
, “less than one night per week”
, or “one or more 
nights per week”).
Statistical Analysis
The prevalence of asthma was calculated by demographic character-
istics, 9/11-exposures, and mental health screening measures. The 
asthma control analysis was restricted to adolescents with asthma. 
A chi-squared test was used to compare level of asthma control for 
demographic characteristics, unmet healthcare needs, behavioral and 
mental health outcomes, and 9/11-exposures. Using logistic regres-
sion, adjusted odds ratios were calculated to estimate the strength 
of association between asthma control and those variables that were 
significant in the bivariate analysis at P ≤ 0.05. Based on preliminary 
analyses, adjustment variables were: age, gender, race/ethnicity, and 
being caught in the dust cloud on 9/11. All analyses were conducted 
using SAS Version 9.2 (Cary, NC).
