IMPORTANCE Clinical subtyping of Parkinson disease at diagnosis is useful in estimating
disease course and survival. Severity and rate of progression of neuropathologies are
important determinants of clinical Parkinson subtypes.
OBJECTIVE To provide longitudinal clinical disease-course data and neuropathologic
correlation for newly proposed Parkinson disease subtypes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with
autopsy-confirmed Parkinson disease who were regularly seen throughout their disease
course by hospital specialists in the United Kingdom and donated their brain at death to the
Queen Square Brain Bank between January 2009 and December 2017. Patients with
additional neuropathologic diagnoses, monogenic forms of parkinsonism, or insufficiently
detailed clinical information were excluded. Based on severity of motor symptoms, rapid eye
movement sleep behavior disorder, and autonomic and cognitive function at diagnosis,
patients were classified adapting a subtyping classification into mild-motor predominant,
intermediate, or diffuse malignant subtypes.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Time from diagnosis to disease milestones (recurrent falls,
wheelchair dependence, dementia, and care home placement) and death were compared
between subtypes, and their risk was estimated using Cox hazard regression models. Severity
and distribution of Lewy pathology and Alzheimer disease–related pathology were assessed
using staging systems.
RESULTS From a total of 146 patients, 111 patients were included (67 men [60.4%]; mean [SD]
age at diagnosis, 62.5 [11.5] years). The diffuse malignant subtype had earlier development of
milestones and reduced survival. Cox proportional hazard regression showed an increased
adjusted risk of any disease milestone (hazard ratio, 10.90; 95% CI, 5.51-21.58; P < .001) and
death (hazard ratio, 3.65; 95% CI, 1.98-6.75; P < .001) in the diffuse malignant group. Age at
diagnosis was the only additional variable with statistical significance (adjusted hazard ratio
for death, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.11-1.17; P <.001). Staging of Lewy pathology and Alzheimer
disease–related pathology did not differ between subtypes, although they showed different
rates of progression, and the latter was associated with age at death.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Parkinson clinical subtypes at diagnosis may estimate disease
course and survival, which may be useful in providing a more accurate prognosis in individual
patients in clinical practice and helping to stratify subgroups in clinical trials. Different severity
and progression of neuropathologies are important determinants of Parkinson subtypes, and
age at diagnosis should be included in future subtype classifications.

 C
linical heterogeneity is well recognized in Parkinson
disease (PD),1 and many attempts have been made to
identify distinct clinical syndromic patterns. Initial
empirical classifications have been gradually replaced by data-
drivenclusteranalysiswithoutapriorihypotheses,2,3andnon-
motor symptoms with prognostic implications have been
incorporated into PD subtypes.4-9
However, new clinical subtypes have attracted some criti-
cism. With very few exceptions,5,9 most cluster studies have
no longitudinal follow-up, and therefore, evidence to assess
the long-term validity of the proposed clinical subtypes on dis-
ease progression is lacking. Classification of patients with PD
is purely based on data association and may not reflect under-
lying pathophysiology driving clinical heterogeneity. Further-
more, there is very little information on neuropathologic find-
ings and clinical subtypes,10 and only a few studies provide
supporting data on biomarkers.5,7 One of these studies iden-
tified 4 clinical features (motor severity, cognitive impair-
ment, dysautonomia, and rapid eye movement behavior dis-
order [RBD]) as key determinants for subtyping. Using a
comprehensive data set of clinical manifestations at diagno-
sis, with additional neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid bio-
marker data from the Parkinson’
s Progression Markers Initia-
tive study,11 3 distinct groups based on cluster analysis were
identified: mild-motor predominant, diffuse malignant, and
intermediate.5 The prognostic value of this subtype classifi-
cation remains to be confirmed because patients were fol-
lowed up for less than 3 years, and its usefulness in other popu-
lations has not been tested. By using clinical records that
include detailed information regarding nonmotor symptoms
on a large group of pathology-confirmed PD cases at the Queen
Square Brain Bank (QSBB), we now provide longitudinal data
throughout the disease course and neuropathologic correla-
tion for the newly proposed clinical subtypes and suggest pos-
siblepathophysiologicmechanismsresponsibleforclinicaland
neuropathologic heterogeneity.
Methods
Study Design
Thisisaretrospectivecohortstudyofconsecutivepatientswith
aneuropathologicallyconfirmeddiagnosisofPDfromtheQSBB
in London, England, between January 2009 and December
2017. Patients were excluded if (1) a diagnosis of dementia be-
fore or within 1 year of the onset of motor symptoms was
made,12 (2) neuropathologic diagnosis of an additional neu-
rodegenerative condition was found on postmortem exami-
nation, (3) it was monogenic form of parkinsonism, or (4) com-
prehensiveclinicalrecordsthroughouttheentirediseasecourse
were not available. The brain donor program was approved by
a London Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee, and writ-
ten informed consent was obtained from all donors.
Clinical Assessment
Clinical records were systematically reviewed by a neurolo-
gist with expertise in PD (E. D. P.-F.). All patients were as-
sessed by hospital specialists (neurologists or geriatricians) in
the United Kingdom regularly throughout disease course. The
presence and severity of the cardinal motor signs of PD at the
time of diagnosis, including tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and
postural instability, were recorded. The following nonmotor
features were also included: (1) autonomic dysfunction de-
fined by the presence of any 2 of the following symptoms or
signs persistent for longer than 6 months (urinary symptoms,
constipation, symptoms of upper gastrointestinal tract dys-
function, orthostatic hypotension, sweating abnormalities, or
erectile dysfunction in men),13 (2) clinically diagnosed RBD de-
fined as presence of repeated episodes of sleep-related vocal-
ization and/or complex motor behavior, (3) cognitive dysfunc-
tion (graded according to the degree of impairment of tasks of
daily living from mild cognitive impairment to severe demen-
tia), and (4) symptoms of major depressive disorder. Grading
of symptom severity was performed blinded to disease course
and neuropathologic data, based on the clinical relevance of
the symptoms on the premise that this would be well docu-
mented in the clinical notes. Using a 4-point semiquantita-
tive scale based on the clinical impression by the treating phy-
sician, symptoms and signs were graded as follows: (0) absent;
(1) mild symptom severity/mild distress to patient/no thera-
peutic intervention required; (2) moderate symptom severity/
moderate distress to patient/good symptomatic control with
therapeutic intervention; and (3) severe intensity/severe dis-
tress to patient/poor symptomatic control despite therapeu-
tic intervention.
To assess disease progression, time of onset from diagno-
sis to specific disease milestones were recorded14,15: (1) regu-
lar falls or (2) wheelchair dependence as milestones of motor
disability; (3) dementia, defined as cognitive impairment se-
vere enough to significantly affect tasks of daily living; and (4)
placement in residential or nursing home care as a measure of
global disability. Time from diagnosis to death (survival) was
also recorded.
Subtype Definitions
Definitions proposed by Fereshtehnejad et al5 were adapted
to our retrospective, nonstandardized clinical data so that our
subtypes corresponded to their criteria as closely as possible.
Key Points
Question Does clinical subtyping of Parkinson disease at
diagnosis estimate disease progression and neuropathology?
Findings In this cohort study, clinical subtyping of 111
autopsy-confirmed patients with Parkinson disease based on
motor symptoms, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder,
and autonomic and cognitive dysfunction at diagnosis showed
different disease course and survival rates across subtypes.
Parkinson subtypes were associated with different rates of Lewy
pathology and Alzheimer disease–related neuropathology
progression.
Meaning Clinical subtyping in Parkinson disease is feasible in
clinical practice and provides accurate estimation of disease
progression and survival; different neuropathologies are
important determinants of clinical subtypes and contribute to the
clinical heterogeneity.

 Our semiquantitative severity scores of motor and nonmotor
features were converted into 4 domains that included 1 com-
posite for motor (a composite of the individual scores for
tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability) and 1
composite for autonomic dysfunction (a composite of the in-
dividual scores for urinary symptoms, constipation, symp-
toms of upper gastrointestinal tract dysfunction, orthostatic
hypotension, sweating abnormalities, and erectile dysfunc-
tion in men) and 2 individual scores for RBD and cognitive dys-
function. The corresponding 75th percentile was calculated for
each domain, and patients were classified at the time of diag-
nosis into 3 subtypes:
• Mild-motor predominant. Motor and all nonmotor scores less
than the 75th percentile.
• Diffuse malignant. Either motor score greater than the 75th
percentile and at least 1 nonmotor score greater than the 75th
percentile or all 3 nonmotor scores greater than the 75th per-
centile.
• Intermediate. All those individuals not meeting criteria for
other subtypes.
As a consequence of adapting the original subtyping sys-
tem using quantitative assessment tools to a semiquantita-
tivescalewithlimitedcategories,groupsofpatientscouldhave
the same score corresponding to the 75th percentile. All those
patients with the same score were allocated to the same group
(either >75th or <75th percentile group) based on where most
of them distributed. For example, the 75th percentile for RBD
score was 1 = mild, and 2 patients with this score fell into the
less than 75th percentile group while 22 fell into the greater
than 75th percentile group; therefore, all patients with RBD
score mild were allocated to the greater than 75th percentile
group.
Neuropathologic Assessment
Formalin-fixed brain tissue samples were examined with im-
munohistochemistry using standard protocols. Representa-
tive sections of brainstem, basal forebrain, and neocortical
areas were graded for distribution and severity of Lewy pa-
thology, and each individual was assigned to a Lewy body sub-
type (brainstem, limbic, or diffuse neocortical) and a Braak
stage (stage 1-6) based on Lewy body scores.12,16,17 Severity of
neurofibrillary tangle pathology was assessed using specific
immunohistochemistry against hyperphosphorylated tau pro-
tein and the staging system described by Braak and Braak.18,19
Amyloid β immunostaining was used for the assessment of
amyloid β deposition, and neuritic plaques and their severity
and extent were graded based on the classifications pro-
posed by Thal et al20 and the Consortium to Establish a Reg-
istry for Alzheimer’
s Disease protocol.21 Global Alzheimer dis-
ease neuropathologic changes were assessed using the ABC
scoring system proposed by the National Institute on Aging–
Alzheimer’
s Association guidelines (absent, low, intermedi-
ate, and high) based on the combination of neurofibrillary
tangle, amyloid β deposition, and neuritic plaque severity.22
Statistical Analysis
Comparisons between groups were performed using Fisher ex-
act test for categorical variables, and analysis of variance
(ANOVA) for continuous variables as appropriate, with
Bonferroni correction for multiple pairwise comparisons.
Ordinal neuropathology stages were analyzed using the
Kruskal-Wallis test.
Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models
were used to estimate the risk of disease milestones and death
for each Parkinson subtype. Other potential confounders, in-
cluding age at diagnosis, sex, levodopa response, and depres-
sion severity, were included in the model as explanatory vari-
ables.Onlythosewitharelevantassociationinthemultivariate
analysis were included in the final model. Adjusted hazard ra-
tios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated.
Kaplan-Meier curves of disease milestones and survival were
plotted for each Parkinson subtype. Visual inspection of Ka-
plan-Meier curves and plots of scaled Schoenfeld residuals
against time were used to assess the proportional hazards as-
sumption. Censoring was considered uninformative. Two-
tailed tests were performed, statistical significance was set at
P < .05, and Stata statistical software, version 12 (StataCorp),
was used for statistical analysis.
Results
Onehundredelevenpatients(67men[60.4%]),withmean(SD)
age at diagnosis of 62.5 (11.5) years, were included in the final
analysis (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). The demographic data
and clinical features of the whole group and by Parkinson sub-
types are shown in Table 1.23 The QSBB cohort did not differ
in age at diagnosis (mean [SD], 62.5 [11.5] years vs 61.1 [9.7]
years; t = −1.299; P = .20), sex (male sex, n = 67 of 111 [60.4%]
vs n = 276 of 421 [65.6%]; χ2 = 1.04; P = .31), or PD subtype dis-
tribution (mild-motor predominant/intermediate/diffuse ma-
lignant:48.7%,35.1%,and16.2%,respectively,vs52.5%,38.5%,
and 9.0%, respectively; χ2 = 4.83; P = .09) compared with the
referenceParkinson’
sProgressionMarkersInitiativegroup.Pa-
tientswiththemild-motor–predominantsubtypepatientswere
significantly younger at diagnosis, had a better response to le-
vodopa, and received a higher levodopa equivalent dose. Pa-
tients with the diffuse-malignant subtype were older, were al-
most all men, had a poorer response to levodopa, and were
more frequently misdiagnosed as having an atypical parkin-
sonian syndrome in life (Table 1 for all comparisons).
Disease Progression and Survival in PD Subtypes
The PD subtypes showed different rates of deterioration, with
the diffuse malignant subtype reaching all prognostic mile-
stonesearlierinthediseasecourseandhavingtheshortestsur-
vival (ANOVA; Table 1 for all comparisons; eFigure 2 in the
Supplement). Non–PD-related causes of death were similar be-
tween groups. Despite differences in disease progression and
survival, PD subtypes did not differ in disability at the time of
death as judged by the presence of disease milestones, and all
subtypes reached advanced stages, with 105 of 111 patients
(94.6%) reaching at least 1 disease milestone (Table 1).
Only PD subtype and age at diagnosis remained signifi-
cant in the multivariate model (Table 2). The diffuse-
malignant group showed an increased risk of development of

 severity of comorbid Alzheimer disease–related neuro-
pathologic changes was also similar among different PD
subtypes measured using several accepted staging systems
(Table 3).
To elucidate potential pathogenic mechanisms, we ana-
lyzed the association between neuropathologic findings and
other demographic characteristics. Neurofibrillary tangle
pathology (ANOVA; F6,104 = 2.84; P = .01), Consortium to

s Disease neuritic plaques
(ANOVA; F3,107 = 3.56; P = .02), and Alzheimer disease–
related pathology (ANOVA; F3,107 = 4.12; P = .008) showed
significant association with increased age at death. Associa-
tion of neocortical Lewy pathology and disease duration did
not reach statistical significance (ANOVA; F1,109 = 3.64;
P = .06).
Discussion
Thislarge,retrospectivestudyofpathology-confirmedpatients
with PD provides, for the first time to our knowledge, entire
life-course data on new Parkinson subtypes that incorporate
nonmotor symptoms into their classification and also permits
neuropathologic correlation. Our results showed that clinical

and survival. Different rates of neuropathologic progression
appear to be important determinants of clinical subtypes.

 Fereshtehnejad et al5 because of its potential applicability in
clinical practice, using an algorithm that translates groups
to an individual level and the presence of imaging and
biomarker supporting data.5 We adapted the classification
to a semiquantitative grading assessment using nonstan-
dardized collected clinical data, with similar representation
of PD subtypes. Age at diagnosis was not included in
this classification system, although it has been considered
a key determinant in PD subtypes by others.25 Age at
diagnosis differed significantly among PD subtypes in our
study, was an important independent factor associated with
faster disease progression and reduced survival in the
multivariate regression model, and was associated with
comorbid pathologies. Based on our findings, we propose
that age at diagnosis should be included in any PD subtype
definition.
Disease Progression and Prognosis
Very few studies have assessed the validity of Parkinson sub-
types longitudinally,4,9,26 and the short follow-up periods limit
making firm conclusions. To our knowledge, this study is the
first to provide life-course data on disease progression and
shows that clinical subtyping estimates the development of
clinically relevant motor, cognitive, and global disability dis-
ease milestones and reduced survival. It is worth emphasiz-
ing that these results were independent of other potential con-
foundersanddespitedifferencesinageatthetimeofdiagnosis.
Neuropathologic Correlation and Pathophysiologic
Implications of Clinical Subtypes
Our study provided postmortem confirmation of the diagno-
sis, as opposed to previous PD subtype studies that may have
aninherentdiagnosticaccuracybias,particularlyatearlystages

 of the disease.27,28 Most patients in our study reached ad-
vanced stages (Figure 2), and PD subtypes did not show any
differences in the severity or distribution of Lewy pathology.
Only one previous study, using a separate group of patients
fromtheQueenSquareBrainBank,attemptedtocorrelatepost-
mortem findings with Parkinson subtypes, although direct
comparisons cannot be drawn because the subtype classifi-
cation did not include nonmotor features.10 In this previous
study, clinical subtypes did not show a clear correlation with
neuropathologicstages,althoughpatientswithnontremorsub-
type had more severe neocortical Lewy pathology.10 Previ-
ous clinicopathologic evidence suggests nonlinear progres-
sion in the late stages of the disease, with patients reaching a
common pathologic end point.14,29 Because most of the pa-
tients were at this pathologic end point, if there are topo-
graphicdifferencesinLewypathologyresponsiblefortheclini-
cal heterogeneity during life disease course, they are no longer
detectable at post mortem. However, our results suggest that
the speed of the pathologic process varies between subtypes
because a similar pathologic end point is reached in all of them
despite differing disease duration. Similar conclusions were
reached by Kempster et al14 in previous clinicopathologic stud-
ies when correlating clinical progression with neuropatho-
logic findings in patients with PD divided in groups by age at
death14 and patterns of levodopa response.29 Taken together,
the results show that despite a heterogeneous disease course
during early-middle stages, advanced stages of the disease are
clinicallyverysimilar,withaccumulationofdisabilityinasimi-
lar time course followed by death without any differences on
neuropathologic findings at post mortem (Figure 3). A non-
linear progression may govern the terminal stages of the neu-
rodegenerative process, and age and other comorbid patholo-
gies may play a synergistic effect.14,29 Analysis of comorbid
pathology in this study’
s cases showed no significant differ-
ences in Alzheimer disease–related neuropathology among PD
subtypes, which suggests a more rapid deposition in the group
withshorterdiseaseduration(diffusemalignant),althoughage
seems to be an additional important determinant, as dis-
cussed in subsequent paragraphs.
Further analysis revealed that in addition to PD sub-
type, other demographic factors may influence neuropatho-
logic progression. In this group of patients, while Lewy
body pathology seems to be a primary disease-related pro-
cess because neocortical Lewy stages were associated with
disease duration, Alzheimer disease–related pathology
showed a significant association with age at death
(Figure 2B). Halliday et al30 evaluated pathologically dis-
tinct Parkinson subgroups and correlated them with clinical
findings. Three different patterns of pathologic progression
were identified: a group with Lewy pathology progressing
anatomically as described by Braak,16 who presented with
young-onset and long-disease duration, a second group
with early severe neocortical Lewy pathology presenting
with dementia, and a third group with marked cortical Lewy
pathology associated with Alzheimer disease–related and
vascular changes with older onset and complex disease
course. The analysis of the overall pathologic findings in our
entire cohort of patients (which excluded patients with a
presentation of Lewy body dementia) showed that some of
the factors affecting the rate of progression are in agreement
with the Halliday et al study.30
Combining our findings with results from previous clini-
copathologic studies,14,29-31 several conclusions with regards
to the mechanisms underlying the clinical and pathological
variability in PD can be made (Figure 2).
• YoungpatientspresentingwithamoreclassicLewybodyphe-
notype with mild motor and nonmotor symptoms (mild-
motor predominant) show a slow disease course and neuro-
pathologic progression before they reach the terminal stages
of the disease. Disease duration seems to be the main deter-
minant of clinical and pathologic progression in this sub-
group.
• Additional factors are likely to contribute to the more rapid
spreadofLewypathologythroughoutthebrainindiffusema-
lignant subtypes. Moreover, other age-related pathologies
contribute to the clinical picture in older patients with a more
complex disease course (corresponding to the diffuse malig-
nant subgroup) and more rapid clinical and pathologic

A schematic representation of the
clinical course illustrating symptom

subtypes. In the early-middle stages,
PD has a very heterogeneous course,
with different rates of progression
and levels of disability among
Parkinson subtypes. In the final
stages of the diseases, there is an
exponential clinical progression, with
all patients with PD reaching a similar
end point characterized by severe
disability followed by death at the
same age.

 progression, with a potential synergistic effect between co-
morbid pathologies.
• There may also be topographic differences in Lewy pathol-
ogy distribution at the early stages of the disease, with
those with an initial cognitive presentation consistent with
Lewy body dementia showing early involvement of corti-
cal areas,30 although these patients were not included in
either our study or the Parkinson’
s Progression Markers
Initiative cohort.
Strengths and Limitations
The main strengths of this study are the length of longitudi-
nal regular follow-up and the detailed neuropathologic find-
ings. The retrospective nature of the study and the assess-
ment by different professionals without clear methodologic
homogeneity (including the lack of validated questionnaires
or investigations such as cardiovascular autonomic function
tests or polysomnography) may potentially account for some
limitations in the accuracy of the recording of the symptoms.
To limit this potential bias, strict exclusion criteria were used,
and only the most recent cases with detailed and regular clini-
cal information from PD hospital specialists were selected. De-
spite this and the fact that clinical information at the time of
diagnosis was documented in detail for all included cases, we
acknowledge that some of the symptoms, particularly mild
nonmotorsymptomswithoutsignificanteffectonclinicalprac-
tice, may have been underreported. As discussed in previous
paragraphs, the advanced clinical and pathologic stages of our
patients may have limited detection of any potential neuro-
pathologic topographic differences in earlier stages of the dis-
ease.
Conclusions
Clinical subtyping of PD based on motor symptoms, RBD, and
autonomic and cognitive dysfunction at diagnosis is feasible
in clinical practice and provides accurate long-term estima-
tion of disease progression and survival. Different patholo-
gies with differing rates of progression are important deter-
minants of clinical subtypes, and age at diagnosis should be
included in future subtype classification systems.

Factors contributing to
neuropathologic heterogeneity in PD.
Lewy pathology seems directly
associated with the duration of the
disease in a proportion of patients
with slow clinical and pathologic
progression. Other factors may
modulate this association, and
Parkinson subtypes seem to have a
different neuropathologic
progression rate because all cases
reach advanced stages despite
significant differences in disease
duration. Distribution of Lewy
pathology is also variable, and at least
a proportion of those patients
presenting with early dementia show
diffuse neocortical Lewy pathology
since the onset compared with the
typical caudo-rostral pattern of
progression seen in most patients.
Other comorbid pathologies are likely
to contribute to the clinical
heterogeneity. Particularly important
in elderly patients is the presence of
Alzheimer disease pathology, which is
directly associated with age at death.
