 Prevalence and Correlates of Skin Cancer Screening
Among Indoor Tanners and Nontanners
Carolyn J. Heckman, PhD; Elizabeth Handorf, PhD; Melissa V. Auerbach, PhD
IMPORTANCE The US Food and Drug Administration recommends that indoor tanners (ITs) be
screened regularly for skin cancer (SC).
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between indoor tanning and SC screening.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The 2015 National Health Interview Survey was a
multistage, clustered, cross-sectional design with 30 352 US adults participating. The response
rate for the sample adult data used in this study was 55.20% after excluding 1099 individuals
who reported a history of SC and 2221 individuals with unknown SC screening or indoor tanning
history. To examine the independent correlates of screening, we conducted multiple logistic
regressions separately for ITs and nontanners (NTs), simultaneously including all preselected
variables of interest as potential predictors. Formal interaction analyses were also performed to
determine if the covariate effects differed significantly between ITs and NTs.
EXPOSURES Indoor tanning as well as sociodemographic, health care, and SC risk and sun
protection factors.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was self-reported full-body SC
screening by a physician. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted to
determine the secondary outcome, correlates of SC screening among ITs and NTs.
RESULTS A total of 15 777 participants (51.98%) were female, and 23 823 (78.49%) were white;
4987 (16.43%) of the sample had indoor tanned, and 1077 (21.59%) of these had tanned last
year. A total of 1505 ITs (30.18%) and 4951 NTs (19.52%) had been screened for SC. Correlates of
screening for ITs and NTs were older age (ITs: odds ratio [OR], 4.29 [95% CI, 2.72-6.76]; NTs, OR,
5.14 [95% CI, 4.01-6.58], age �65 years vs 18-29 years), higher income (ITs: OR, 2.08 [95% CI,
1.50-2.88]; NTs: OR, 1.79 [95% CI, 1.51-2.12]; >$100 000 vs $0-34 999), seeking online health
information (ITs, OR, 0.71 [95% CI. 0.56-0.91; NTs, OR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.58-0.72], for not looking
up health info online), family history of melanoma (ITs: OR, 1.92 [95% CI, 1.26-2.93]; NTs: OR,
1.58 [95% CI, 1.21-2.05]) or SC (ITs: OR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.17-2.17; NTs: OR, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.33-1.94]),
very high SPF sunscreen use (ITs: OR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.42-0.78]; NTs: OR, 0.71 [95% CI,
0.61-0.82], use of SPF of 1-14 vs SPF of >50), and receipt of a professional spray-on tan (ITs: OR,
0.60 [ 95% CI, 0.41-0.88]; NTs: OR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.32-0.81], for not receiving a salon spray-on
tan). Correlates for NTs only were white race (blacks: OR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.37-0.54], others: OR,
0.40 [95% CI, 0.33-0.48]), non-Hispanic ethnicity (Hispanics: OR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.36-0.50]),
email use (no email: OR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.56-0.80]), having a usual clinic/or physician’
s office (no
usual place: OR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.40-0.78]), emergency department visits (OR, 1.20 [95% CI,
1.06-1.35]), having had a previous cancer diagnosis (no cancer diagnosis: OR, 0.67 [95% CI,
0.57-0.79]), not being worried about medical bills (OR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.15-1.63] vs very worried),
sun protection (rarely/never: OR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.34-0.56]), and sunless self-tanning (not using:
OR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.47-0.83]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Few ITs have been screened for SC, although SC rates are
higher than among NTs. It is not surprising that SC screening is associated with SC risk factors
(eg, family history of SC and age) among ITs. However, some unscreened ITs may be putting
themselves at even greater risk of SC by also being more likely to use low SPF sunscreen than
ITs who have been screened for SC.

 A
lmost 5 million skin cancers are diagnosed annually in
the United States, and skin cancer incidence has been
rising over the past few decades.1-4 Survival rates for
skin cancers are high, particularly when detected early.5 Skin
cancer screening is associated with detection of thinner tu-
mors, which are associated with lower mortality rates.5 Re-
searchhasnotyetshownadirectmortalitybenefitforskincan-

high-risk groups.6,7
The millions of Americans who have tanned indoors are
at much higher risk of melanoma and keratinocyte skin can-
cersthanthegeneralpopulation.8,9Owingtoaccumulatingevi-
dence of the harms of indoor tanning, the US Food and Drug
Administration(FDA)andsimilarbodiesinothercountrieshave
becomeincreasinglystringentaboutitsregulation.In2014,the
FDA required manufacturers of indoor tanning devices to pro-
vide this warning statement to users: “Warning: Persons re-
peatedly exposed to UV radiation should be regularly evalu-
ated for skin cancer.”10 In December 2015, the FDA proposed
a rule to require users to sign a risk acknowledgment certifi-
cation before use and every 6 months thereafter, stating that
they were informed of health risks. One of the proposed re-
quired risk statements is “If you use indoor UV tanning de-
vices and/or tan regularly outdoors, get regular skin cancer
checkups from your physician because you are more likely to
develop skin cancer.
”11 Because these risk statements are rela-
tively new and do not seem to have been well publicized, it is
doubtful that most primary care physicians or indoor tanners
(ITs) are aware of them.
Despite the relatively large amount of literature on skin
cancer screening and increasing attention to indoor tanning,
few studies have investigated the intersection between the 2.
SeveralEuropeanstudieshavefoundthat,comparedwithnon-
tanners (NTs), ITs are less likely to conduct skin self-
examinations or receive a full-body examination by a clini-
cian,receiveearlydiagnosis,orsurvivemelanoma.12-15Areview
of literature from Northern Europe also noted an association
among sunbed use, lower socioeconomic status, later diagno-
sis, thicker tumors, and higher mortality.14
Using data from the 2005 National Health Interview Sur-
vey (NHIS), a national probability survey of the US adult popu-
lation, our team previously found that the proportion of indi-
viduals who had tanned indoors in the past year was not
significantly different between individuals who had ever been
screened for skin cancer by a physician (7%-30%) vs those who
had not been screened (8%-30%), based on age-stratified
analyses.16 However, using 2010 NHIS data, Lakhani and
colleagues17 found that individuals who had tanned indoors
in the past year were more likely than NTs to have been
screened for skin cancer. Using 2015 NHIS data, Fischer and
colleagues18 did not find a difference in the skin cancer screen-
ingrateamongrecentITsstratifiedbyageorsexcomparedwith
NTs.However,theauthorsfocusedonfrequencyofindoortan-
ning in the past year rather than ever engaging in indoor tan-
ning and did not assess screening correlates. The methods of
these studies have varied and produced mixed findings, and
the most recent study included only a subsample of the 2015
NHIS data. Therefore, the current study extends the investi-
gation of the prevalence and correlates of skin cancer screen-
ing among ITs using the full 2015 NHIS sample.
Methods
Procedures
This study used data from the 2015 NHIS, a national health sur-
vey of the US adult population. The NHIS uses a multistage,
clustered,cross-sectionaldesign,withstratificationatthestate
level and oversampling of Hispanic and black populations. The
response rate for the sample adult data used in this study was
55.20%; the methodology of the 2015 NHIS is described in de-
tail elsewhere.19 The current study used publically available
deidentified archival data and, thus, did not involve human
subjects and was exempt from review by the Fox Chase Can-
cer Center institutional review board. The sample included
30 352 participants after excluding 1099 individuals who re-
ported a history of skin cancer and 2221 individuals with un-
known skin cancer screening or indoor tanning history.
Measures
Indoor Tanning, Demographics, and Skin Cancer Screening
Participants were asked if they had ever used an indoor tan-
ning device, such as a sunlamp, sunbed, or tanning booth. In-
dividuals who reported any history of indoor tanning were de-
fined as ITs, and participants who had never indoor tanned
wereconsideredNTs.Participantsindicatedtheirsex,age,race/
ethnicity,sexualorientation,maritalstatus,internetuse,email
use, employment status, health insurance status, household
income, and level of worry about paying monthly bills. Par-
ticipants were asked whether they had ever had all of their skin
from head to toe examined by a dermatologist or other kind
of physician and the main reason for having the examination.
Health Information and Health Care Accessibility
Participants were asked about their level of worry about pay-
ing medical bills if sick or in an accident, having looked up
health information online in the past 12 months, availability
Key Points
Question What are the prevalence and correlates of skin cancer
screening among indoor tanners and nontanners?
Findings In this survey study of 30 352 US adults who
participated in the 2015 National Health Interview Survey,
correlates for screening for tanners and nontanners were older
age, higher income, seeking online health information, family skin
cancer history, very high sun protection factor sunscreen use, and
receipt of professional spray-on tans. Correlates for screening for
nontanners only were white race, non-Hispanic ethnicity, email
use, having a usual clinic or physician’
s office, emergency
department visits, previous cancer diagnosis, no worry about
medical bills, sun protection, and sunless self-tanning.
Meaning Indoor tanners have a greater tendency to be screened
for skin cancer and to be screened at an earlier age than NTs.
However, skin cancer screening is still underused in this high-risk
population.

 of a place to go when sick or in need of health advice, having
a usual place to go for routine and/or preventive health care,
and having visited the emergency department in the past 12
months.
Skin Cancer Risk and Protection Factors
Participants were asked whether they had ever had cancer
(other than skin cancer) and whether any first-degree rela-
tives had ever had melanoma, nonmelanoma, or an un-
known type of skin cancer. Five items asked individuals to re-
port how often they engaged in sun protection behaviors (on
a 5-point scale from always [1] to never [5] as well as the op-
tion“don’
tgointhesun”),includingstayingintheshade,wear-
ing a wide-brimmed hat, wearing a long-sleeved shirt, wear-
ing long pants, and using sunscreen when outside on a warm
sunny day for over an hour. Because these items were highly
correlated,theywereaveragedtocreateasunprotectionscore.
Thesunprotectiondatawereconsideredcategoricalratherthan
continuous for 2 reasons: (1) to avoid assuming a linear effect
of the underlying ordinal Likert scales (1 = always, 5 = never)
and (2) it is unclear how to include the response “don’
t go in
the sun” on a continuous scale. Other items asked partici-
pants how much they would burn if they went in the sun for
an hour with no protection and how dark a tan they would get
iftheywentinthesunrepeatedly,suchaseverydayfor2weeks
without protection. Participants also indicated what sun pro-
tection factor (SPF) sunscreen they used most often and how
many times they had had a sunburn in the past 12 months (cat-
egorized for analyses into 0, 1, or ≥2). Participants were also
askedwhethertheyhadusedself-appliedsunlesstanningprod-
ucts and whether they had received a professional spray-on
tan in the past 12 months.
Data Weighting and Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata software (ver-
sion 12; StataCorp) and accounted for the survey design using
variables provided by the NHIS with the data file. Sample
weights accounted for study design, ratios, and nonre-
sponse, with poststratification adjustments for US Census-
based estimates of age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Standard er-
rors were calculated using first-order Taylor linearization
(Huber-White sandwich variance estimate). All percentages re-
ported in the tables and significance tests are weighted, and
all sample sizes are unweighted.
Given the multiple associations examined and the large
sample size, a cutoff of P < .01 was used to determine statis-
tical significance. A series of χ2 analyses was conducted to
examine the extent to which each potential correlate was
associated with skin cancer screening (binary indicator for
ever vs never) among ITs and NTs. To examine the indepen-
dent correlates of screening, we conducted multiple logistic
regressions separately for ITs and NTs, simultaneously
including all preselected variables of interest as potential
predictors. This method was selected rather than including
only variables significant in univariable analyses because a
lack of significance would not necessarily indicate sufficient
covariate balance, and simultaneous covariate effects would
not be considered.20
Formal interaction analyses were also performed to de-
termine if the covariate effects differed significantly between
ITsandNTs.WeconsideredvariableswithP < .05ineithersub-
group for interaction effects. Separate logistic regression mod-
els were conducted for each candidate interaction term be-
cause a single model with all potential interactions was
intractable. To assess whether interaction effects were pre-
sent, an F test was performed (jointly assessing all covariate
levels for the interaction of interest).

 A total of 1505 (30.18%) of ITs, and 4951 (19.52%) of NTs had
been screened for skin cancer. Of the individuals who re-
ported having been screened for skin cancer, 4420 (68.47%)
reported that this was part of a routine medical examination,
1553(23.59%)thatitwasbecauseofaproblem,and495(7.66%)
reported “other” as the reason.
Results of the univariate analyses are provided in Table 2
and eTable 2 in the Supplement. We focus herein on the re-
sults of the multivariable logistic regressions. Significant
(P < .01)sociodemographicand/orhealthcarecorrelatesofskin
cancer screening for both ITs and NTs were older age (ITs: odds
ratio[OR],4.29[95%CI,2.72-6.76];NTs:OR,5.14[95%CI,4.01-
6.58]; age ≥65 years vs 18-29 years), higher household in-
come (ITs: OR, 2.08 [95% CI, 1.50-2.88]; NTs: OR, 1.79 [95%
CI, 1.51-2.12]; ≥$100 000 vs $0-34 999), and looking up health
information online in the past 12 months (ITs: OR, 0.71 [95%
CI, 0.56-.91]; NTs, OR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.58-0.72], for not look-
ing up health info online). See Table 2 for variables signifi-
cant in the multivariable analyses and eTable 2 in the
Supplement for remaining multivariable and univariable re-
sults. Skin cancer risk and protective factors and behaviors re-
lated to these factors were examined in the multivariable lo-
gistic regressions as well. Significant (P < .01) correlates of skin
cancer screening for both ITs and NTs were a history of mela-
noma (ITs: OR, 1.92 [95% CI, 1.26-2.93]; NTs: OR, 1.58 [95% CI,
1.21-2.05]) or skin cancer (ITs: OR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.17-2.17]; NTs:

high SPF sunscreen (ITs: OR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.42-0.78]; NTs:
OR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.61-0.82]; use of SPF of 1-14 vs SPF of ≥50)
and receipt of a spray-on tan at a salon in the past 12 months
(ITs: OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.41-0.88]; NTs: OR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.32-
0.81] for not receiving a salon spray-on tan).
Remaining variables were significantly associated with
screening in NTs only. Significant sociodemographic corre-
lateswerewhiterace(blacks:OR,0.45[95%CI,0.37-0.54];oth-
ers:OR,0.40[95%CI,0.33-0.48]),non-Hispanicethnicity(His-
panics: OR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.36-0.50]), and using email (no
email: OR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.56-0.80]). Significant health care
correlates were having a usual clinic or physician’
s office to go
forroutineandpreventivehealthcare(nousualplace:OR,0.56
[95% CI, 0.40-0.78]), having visited an emergency depart-
ment in the past 12 months (OR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.06-1.35]), and
not being worried about paying medical bills (OR, 1.37 [95%
CI, 1.15-1.63] vs very worried). Significant skin cancer risk or
protective correlates were a cancer diagnosis other than skin
cancer (no cancer diagnosis: OR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.57-0.79]), al-
ways using sun protection (rarely or never: OR, 0.43 [95% CI,
0.34-0.56]), and use of self-applied sunless tanning products
in the past 12 months (not using: OR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.47-
0.83]). Although more variables were significant correlates of
skin cancer screening for NTs compared with ITs, no signifi-
cant (P < .01) interactions were found (results not shown).
In secondary analyses examining recency of indoor tan-
ning, it was found that compared with NTs, those who had
tanned more than 12 months ago were more likely to have been
screened for skin cancer (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.12-1.45; P < .001),
but indoor tanning in the past 12 months was not signifi-
cantly associated with screening (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.86-1.33;
P = .56).Ofindividualswhohadindoortannedmorethan1year

pared with 248 individuals (23.07%) who had tanned in-
doors in the past 12 months, and 4951 NTs (19.52%).

Regardingtheprevalenceofskincancerscreening,only30.18%

ingwassignificantlyassociatedwitholderage,familyskincan-
cer history, higher household income, looking up health

ceiving a professional spray-on tan in the past 12 months. Ad-
ditional variables associated with screening in NTs only were
white race, non-Hispanic ethnicity, using email, having a usual
clinic or physician’
s office to go for routine and/or preventive
health care, having visited an emergency department in the
past 12 months, not being worried about paying medical bills,
acancerdiagnosisotherthanskincancer,alwaysusingsunpro-
tection, and use of self-applied sunless tanning products in the
past 12 months.
This study adds to the small quantity of literature on the
relationship between indoor tanning and skin cancer screen-
ing. Although the FDA recommends that individuals repeat-
edly exposed to UV radiation be screened regularly for skin
cancer,10,11 less than a third of ITs had ever been screened. The
current findings contrast with those of several European stud-
ies in which NTs were more likely to have been screened than
ITs.12-15 That ITs were more likely to get skin cancer screening
than NTs in the current study is similar to the findings of
Lakhani and colleagues17 using 2010 NHIS data. However, the
current study seems to be the first to use NHIS data focusing
on ever, rather than recent, indoor tanning. It was found that
more ITs are getting screened at younger ages than NTs, which
is interesting given that the association between indoor tan-
ning and skin cancer screening is primarily driven by those
whose most recent indoor tanning event was more than 12
monthsago.Theassociationofscreeningwithpast,ratherthan
recent, indoor tanning might indicate that former ITs are more
likely than recent ITs to be aware of their increased risk and
seek skin cancer screening accordingly. Two prior NHIS stud-
ies did not find a difference in the screening rates among ITs
compared with NTs, but one study used data that is more than
10 years old,16 and the other sample included only non-
Hispanic white adults ages 18 to 60 years.18
Severalofthemultivariableassociationsbetweenskincan-
cer screening and sociodemographic and skin cancer risk and
protective factors are consistent with findings of prior
research.21 Although some variables were significant corre-
lates of screening in NTs but not in ITs, significant interac-
tions were not found. In addition, there were no variables that
were significant for ITs but not NTs. This suggests that differ-
ences in significance were primarily driven by the larger and
more heterogeneous sample of NTs, and not subgroup-
specific effects. For example, ITs are more likely to be non-
Hispanic whites than NTs. Thus, there is less power to dem-

 onstrate a difference in screening among ITs by race or
ethnicity. Therefore, the correlates that were statistically sig-
nificant for both groups are highlighted here. First, consis-
tent with prior research,21 a history of skin cancer among first-
degree relatives was associated with skin cancer screening.
Greater awareness of family risk and its implications, particu-
larly among ITs, could help motivate prevention and detec-
tion. However, some individuals are not knowledgeable about
the skin cancer history of their family, for example—whether
the skin cancers were melanomas or keratinocyte skin
cancers.22 Second, variables related to health information or
potential access to health care (ie, looking up health informa-
tiononlineandhigherhouseholdincome)wereassociatedwith
screening.Notably,priorresearchfoundanassociationoflower
socioeconomic status with thicker and more advanced mela-
nomas and higher mortality.14,23 Third, some skin cancer pro-
tective factors were associated with being screened for skin
cancer. Similar to prior research in the general population,21
use of low-SPF sunscreen (compared with very high SPF sun-
screen) was associated with a lower likelihood of skin cancer
screening among ITs. Thus, some individuals may be putting
themselves at risk for skin cancer in multiple ways (eg, by hav-
ing tanned indoors and using ineffective sunscreen) and are
also underusing skin cancer detection strategies. Finally, we
found no prior study that had investigated the association be-
tween sunless tanning and skin cancer screening. In addition
to having access to disposable income, the association be-
tween receiving a professional spray-on tan in the past 12
months and skin cancer screening suggests a general concern
about the health and/or appearance of one’
s skin among a sub-
group of both ITs and NTs.
Limitations
Limitations of the current study include the narrow focus of
the items (ie, only 1 or a few items per topic and limited re-
sponse options) and their cross-sectional nature. The order of
occurrence of behaviors such as indoor tanning, UV-free (sun-
less) tanning, and skin cancer screening was not explored in
the current study but should be in future research. In addi-
tion, it is difficult to interpret associations between not going
out in the sun and skin cancer screening, because skin pro-
tection is not necessary when indoors, and it is unknown
whether individuals who do not go in the sun do so to protect
their skin. However, only 5.09% to 8.08% of the sample re-
ported not going out in the sun. Future research exploring the
relationships among these behaviors in more depth could be
useful.
Conclusions
Indoor tanners have a greater tendency to be screened for skin
cancer and to be screened at an earlier age than NTs. How-
ever, skin cancer screening is still underused in this high-risk
population,evenamongformerITs.TheFDArecommendsthat
individuals repeatedly exposed to UV radiation be screened
regularly for skin cancer, but it is likely that ITs and their gen-
eral practitioners are unaware of this recommendation, which
should be disseminated more widely. The current data sug-
gest that providing the public with greater access to health in-
formation and health care (eg, waiving copays) should be in-
vestigated as potential strategies to increase skin cancer
screeningrates,especiallyamonghigh-riskgroups,suchasITs.

 Interventions could target ITs who are younger than 40 years
orwithahouseholdincomeoflessthan$100 000peryear,who
are less likely to be screened than others. It is not surprising
that skin cancer screening is associated with skin cancer risk
factors such as family history of skin cancer and older age
among ITs. However, some unscreened (compared with
screened) ITs may be putting themselves at greater risk of skin
cancer, for example, by also being more likely to use low-SPF
sunscreen, thus offering multiple potential avenues for inter-
vention.
