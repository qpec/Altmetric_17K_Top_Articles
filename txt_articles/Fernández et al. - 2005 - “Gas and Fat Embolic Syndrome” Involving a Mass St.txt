Abstract.
A study of the lesions of beaked whales (BWs) in a recent mass stranding in the Canary Islands
following naval exercises provides a possible explanation of the relationship between anthropogenic, acoustic
(sonar) activities and the stranding and death of marine mammals. Fourteen BWs were stranded in the Canary
Islands close to the site of an international naval exercise (Neo-Tapon 2002) held on 24 September 2002.
Strandings began about 4 hours after the onset of midfrequency sonar activity. Eight Cuvier’s BWs (Ziphius
cavirostris), one Blainville’s BW (Mesoplodon densirostris), and one Gervais’ BW (Mesoplodon europaeus)
were examined postmortem and studied histopathologically. No inflammatory or neoplastic processes were
noted, and no pathogens were identified. Macroscopically, whales had severe, diffuse congestion and hemor-
rhage, especially around the acoustic jaw fat, ears, brain, and kidneys. Gas bubble–associated lesions and fat
embolism were observed in the vessels and parenchyma of vital organs. In vivo bubble formation associated
with sonar exposure that may have been exacerbated by modified diving behavior caused nitrogen supersatu-
ration above a threshold value normally tolerated by the tissues (as occurs in decompression sickness). Alter-
natively, the effect that sonar has on tissues that have been supersaturated with nitrogen gas could be such that
it lowers the threshold for the expansion of in vivo bubble precursors (gas nuclei). Exclusively or in combi-
nation, these mechanisms may enhance and maintain bubble growth or initiate embolism. Severely injured
whales died or became stranded and died due to cardiovascular collapse during beaching. The present study
demonstrates a new pathologic entity in cetaceans. The syndrome is apparently induced by exposure to mid-
frequency sonar signals and particularly affects deep, long-duration, repetitive-diving species like BWs.
Key words:
Beaked whales; fat emboli; gas emboli; marine mammals; mass stranding; naval exercises.
The possibility that exposure to sonar stimuli could
lead to the stranding of cetaceans is an issue of in-
creasing interest because of recent strandings tempo-
rally and geographically coincident with naval sonar
operations.1,11,17,61,66,67 BWs (family Ziphiidae), one of
the deepest-diving whales, are of particular interest be-
cause of a notable relationship between military op-
erations employing midfrequency sonar and BW mass
strandings.1,11 Typically, strandings of BWs prior to
1963, when certain types of midfrequency sonar equip-
ment began to be employed, involved single individ-
uals.1 Subsequently, mass strandings of BWs linked
with naval exercises have been described in several
locations: Bonaire in 1974, the Canary Islands in 1985,
1988, and 1989, Greece in 1996, and the Bahamas in
2000.1,11,17,61,66,67
A mass stranding of BWs in the northern Bahamas
Islands causally incriminated the use of tactical, mid-
frequency sonar because of its close temporal associ-
ation with such naval maneuvers.1,11 Hemorrhage in
the brain, ears, and acoustic fat was reported as the
main lesion found in some BWs in the Bahamas
stranding. A number of acoustically mediated behav-
ioral modifications and pathophysiologic pathways
were proposed to have caused these lesions; however,
conclusive evidence linking a mechanism to the le-
sions was lacking.11
Past research efforts on the potential for anthropo-
genic sound to affect marine mammals have focused
on auditory effects and behavior modifications follow-
ing sound exposure.11,19,28,53 Nonauditory consequences
of exposure to sound have received less attention.6,23
A hypothesized, nonauditory link between strandings
and sonar exposure is proposed to occur when tissues
are supersaturated with dissolved nitrogen gas, and
bubble growth–facilitated diffusion is stimulated with-
in tissues.6,23 Bubble growth could result in emboli-
induced tissue separation and increased localized pres-

sure in tissues, the presumed cause of decompression
sickness (DCS) in human divers.16,31,33,46,47 Following
the initial stimulation of bubble growth in tissue that
has been highly supersaturated with gas, growth could
continue in the absence of a persistent acoustic stim-
ulus. It is believed that marine mammals have evolved
adaptations to prevent deleterious, nitrogen bubble for-
mation.34,50,57 However, to our knowledge, no studies
have specifically addressed whether nitrogen bubble
formation in tissue occurs in diving marine mammals.
Recently, researchers have presented strong evidence
of chronic, gas bubble lesions in the liver and kidney
of different stranded cetacean species.25 These lesions
suggest that gas bubbles formed in vivo can persist
and generate fibrosis in diving cetaceans.14,25 Such em-
boli presumably cause ischemia and would explain the
formation of chronic, bony lesions, consistent with
those of dysbaric osteonecrosis (DON), described in
sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus).40
DCS is the result of the supersaturation of body tis-
sues with nitrogen gas and the subsequent release of
nitrogen gas bubbles.16,26 In human divers, DCS is typ-
ically caused by rapid decompression following dives
using compressed air8,16 and also has been reported
during repetitive, breath-hold dives.15,33,47,52 Until the
lungs collapse during a dive, alveolar gases are ab-
sorbed into the blood proportional to hydrostatic pres-
sure. The amount of gas dissolved in specific tissues
depends on dive depth and duration, descent and as-
cent rates, lipid content of the tissue, and surface time
between successive dives.16,26,42
A number of anatomic, physiologic, and behavioral
adaptations of marine mammals have been proposed
to guard against nitrogen bubble formation.12,34,50,54–57
Due to alveolar collapse, gas exchange does not occur
at depths greater than 70 m in dolphins56 or at depths
greater than 30–50 m in seals.34 Pinnipeds and shal-
low-diving cetaceans are thought to be at low risk of
developing a high nitrogen load, either because lung
collapse obviates gas uptake at deeper depths or be-
cause their typical dive profiles result in only modest
tissue nitrogen accumulation.23 BWs22 are theoretically
at a greater risk of developing deleterious tissue–nitro-
gen levels because their deep prolonged dives increase
during the period in which nitrogen uptake can occur
prior to lung collapse.23 Thus, deep-diving cetaceans
may be more susceptible to the action of high-intensity
acoustic energy on preexisting gas nuclei.6,23
The presence of gas emboli is an important finding
in human DCS, but pulmonary fat emboli have also
been reported with DCS-related, severe cardiorespira-
tory disturbances.26,29 Systemic fat embolism is a sec-
ondary effect of the abrupt pressure changes observed
with DON, a condition initiated by the evolution of
gas bubbles in nitrogen-supersaturated fatty marrow
after inadequate decompression.26,29,30 The clinical
manifestations of fat emboli depend on the volume of
fat reaching the lungs and other affected tissues. Fat
emboli are not reversible with recompression therapy.
The severity of fat emboli–induced clinical disease
may be progressive as survival time after trauma in-
creases.10,31,43,49,62
Forensic pathologists associate fat emboli with bone
fractures, diabetes mellitus, burns, acute pancreatitis,
fat and soft tissue injury, and DCS with acute
DON.10,26,30,31,43,49,62 These entities are underdiagnosed
clinically and at postmortem examination.10,31,49 The
pathogenesis of fat embolism is not fully understood,
and it is likely multifactorial.24 Two mechanisms have
been proposed for the development of fat emboli. First,
direct entry of fat emboli into the bloodstream after
trauma may cause direct, toxic injury in the lung and
produce respiratory insufficiency when free fatty acids
are released from fat tissues.24,62 A second mechanism
involves the generation of fat emboli from plasma li-
poprotein disruption and coalescence of lipid at the
intravascular gas bubble interface.24
Fat emboli have not been reported in stranded ce-
taceans, and reports of gas bubble lesions are uncom-
mon.13,14,25 This report describes the pathologic find-
ings in BWs involved in a mass stranding that oc-
curred coincidentally with naval exercises in the Ca-
nary Islands. Both gas bubble lesions and fat emboli
are documented in these whales, and a hypothesis is
presented to explain the association of mass stranding
of BWs and sonar exposure.
Materials and Methods
The southeastern coast of Fuerteventura (Canary Islands)
is well known for BW aggregations due to its ocean depths
greater than 1,000 m within a few hundred meters of the
coast. On 24 September 2002, 14 BWs were stranded on the
beaches of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote islands. Seven
whales (one female Mesoplodon densirostris, one female
Mesoplodon europaeus, and five male Ziphius cavirostris)
died. The remaining seven live whales were returned to
deeper waters. During the next 3 days, three male BWs and
one female BW (Z. cavirostris) were found dead either on
the coast or floating offshore (Table 1).
The strandings were temporally associated with naval ex-
ercises involving numerous surface warships and several
submarines (maneuvers called Neo-Tapon 2002). The exer-
cise area extended from the coast to up to 40 km away. On
24 September at 9:00 a.m., while examinations of animals
were ongoing, warships were readily visible from 1 km to
several kilometers from the beaches. Spanish naval sources
indicated that tactical, midrange frequency sonar was used
during the exercises from 3:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. on 24
September 2002.
Postmortem examinations were performed35 on the beach
on 10 animals. External findings were recorded, and internal
organs were sampled. The heads were preserved at 4 C and

delivered to the Veterinary School at Gran Canaria for de-
tailed dissection. The first six stranded animals (BW-1
through BW-6) were examined postmortem on 24 Septem-
ber, within 12 hours of stranding. Heads were dissected and
sampled the next day. BW-7 was found dead offshore on the
morning of 25 September. On 25 September, BW-8 and BW-
9, both mature males, were found stranded on Lanzarote,
and BW-9 was found beached with multiple, postmortem
shark bites. BW-10 was found floating close to Fuerteventura
on 26 September and was given a postmortem examination
on 27 September. All the animals were judged to have died
within 24 hours of the first stranded BW that was sighted at
7:00, 24 September 2002. One other whale was recovered
but not examined postmortem because of advanced autoly-
sis.
Tissues were collected and stored in buffered 10% for-
malin immediately or frozen and were later formalin fixed
before processing for routine light microscopy. Tissues from
stranded animals included: brain, hypophysis, choroid plex-
us, cervical spinal cord, liver, lung, kidney, heart, lymph
nodes, digestive tracts, reproductive tracts, and perilarygeal
tissues, including the trachea and thyroid (Table 2). The eyes
from BW-4 were collected.
Histologic stains used on frozen, formalin-fixed tissues to
detect fat emboli were oil red O stain 22 (ORO) and Sudan
black B 23 stain.2,51 Osmium tetroxide postfixation and par-
affin embedding was also used to detect fat emboli.7 A picric
acid technique was used to reduce pigment artifacts when
necessary.5 The best technique for demonstrating fat emboli
was the postfixation with the osmium of paraffin-embedded
tissue. Frozen sections of fixed tissue stained with ORO and
Sudan black B stained fat emboli well, but tissue morphol-
ogy was inferior to osmium postfixation-stained, paraffin-
embedded sections. The picric acid technique removes for-
malin pigment from fixed tissues and demonstrated fat better,
but it washed out some of the lipid from tissue sections.
Because fat emboli are not commonly assessed in stranded
cetaceans, 86 archived samples of lungs of single-stranded
cetaceans found on the coasts of the Canary Islands were
used as fat emboli controls.
Results
The ambient temperatures during the period of the
mass stranding ranged from daytime highs of 24�C to
nighttime lows of 17�C. All stranded animals belonged
to the family Ziphiidae, commonly named BWs. Mac-
roscopically, no systemic, inflammatory, or neoplastic
processes were noted in any animal. In BW-1 through
BW-7, the lack of external trauma and the lack of
marked dermal bruising indicated that blunt trauma
was probably not involved in the stranding (Fig. 1). A
large amount of fresh, undigested gastric contents was
noted in the whales, suggesting a rapid onset of disease
and death. Subconjunctival hemorrhages were ob-
served in several animals.
The first (BW-1 to BW-7) carcasses showed marked
congestion of all organs, particularly the neck (includ-
ing the larynx, thyroid gland, and trachea). Multifocal

petechiae or severe, extensive ecchymoses were ob-
served in the acoustic fat around the jaws (Fig. 2).
Melon fat was examined in only two whales, and some
petechiae were observed in each of these whales. Head
and neck lymph nodes were enlarged and congested.
The lungs were congested and had multiple pleural
hemorrhages. A moderate amount of froth was present
in the tracheas. The peribullar and pterygoid sinuses
were full of white froth. Large cardiac blood vessels
were distended. Macroscopic descriptions of the ab-
dominal organs from the first six animals were brief,
because they were necropsied rapidly so that sample
collection could be finished in natural light. The ab-
dominal lesions included some liver fibrosis, general
organ congestion, and marked congestion of large and
midsize veins. Hemorrhages were seen in congested
kidneys. Parasites (Crassicauda sp.) were observed in
the kidneys of all animals. Diffuse vascular congestion
and some petechiae were observed on the intestinal
serosa. Postmortem examinations of BW-7 to BW-10
showed similar macroscopic lesions, and tissues were
sampled with the exception of central nervous system
(CNS) tissues (Table 2). No detailed macroscopic ex-
amination for gas bubbles was conducted in the por-
tomesenteric veins of any whale.
The primary macroscopic cerebral lesions were se-
vere, diffuse, vascular congestion with multifocal-to-
extensive subarachnoidal hemorrhages (Fig. 3). Clot-
ted blood was observed bilaterally in the lateral ven-
tricles of some brains, along with severe hemorrhaging
around the proximal cervical spinal cord. The gyri of
the brain were swollen and moist. Multifocal hemor-
rhages were observed in the meninges. Macroscopic
gas bubbles that were observed retrospectively in brain
photographs taken during the dissections (Fig. 4) were
prominent within superficial, midsize, cerebral vessels
in some areas.
Histologic lesions in the first seven animals (BW-1
to BW-7) were similar. Severe, diffuse congestion was
observed in the large and small cerebral and pial ves-
sels of the gray and white matter of the cerebral hemi-
spheres. Varying severity and extensions of hemor-
rhaging were observed in the subarachnoid space. In
the brainstem and around the proximal cervical spinal
cord, severe hemorrhaging was observed in the peri-
vascular spaces associated with congested midsize ves-
sels (Fig. 5a). Large unstained vacuoles that did not
stain as fat were observed in some veins and within
hemorrhages in the parenchyma or disrupted columns
of the erythrocytes in perivascular spaces (Fig. 5b).
Intravascular air vacuoles were most numerous in BW-
1. Hemorrhages were observed in the white matter of
most of the animals, and the adjacent parenchyma of-
ten had a spongiotic appearance (edema, Fig. 6). Pro-
teinaceous, perivascular edema fluid and swollen glia
surrounded some vessels. Severe, diffuse hemorrhag-
ing was observed consistently around the cervical me-
dulla and associated with the epidural, vascular plexus.
Less severe hemorrhaging was observed around the
ophthalmic rete of BW-4. Locally extensive conjunc-
tival hemorrhaging sometimes dissected the scleral
connective tissue of BW-4. In the proximal, cervical
spinal cord, vascular congestion and perivascular ede-
ma affected both the white and gray matter.
No cardiac lesions were observed. Pulmonary vas-
cular congestion, vacuoles in midsize veins, atelecta-
sis, and hemorrhage varied from mild to severe among
the whales examined. Multifocal, interstitial, interlob-
ular, and subcapsular hemorrhages were prominent in
the kidneys. Often, renal interlobular connective tissue

was disrupted by venous vacuoles associated with
hemorrhaging (Fig. 7). Moderate congestion of the
glomeruli and vasa recta with some microhemorrhages
were observed in sections of the renal medulla. Mul-
tifocal granulomatous nephritis and pyelitis were as-
sociated with the parasites observed grossly in all of
the kidneys.
All lymph nodes of the head and neck contained
large amounts of erythrocytes in the subcapsular and
sinusoidal areas. Enlarged subcapsular sinuses had
many round-to-oval unstained vacuoles (Fig. 8). Mac-
roscopically, visceral lymph nodes that drained the ar-
eas of hemorrhaging had similar changes. Spleens
were congested. Livers had moderate-to-severe portal
vein congestion, and all livers contained variable num-
bers of sinusoidal vacuoles (Fig. 9). Gastric and intes-
tinal submucosal and serosal vessels were congested.
Some large vacuoles were observed in the submucosal
veins. Intestinal and reproductive tract serosae had fo-
cal hemorrhages.
No fat emboli were detected in the vessels of the
cerebral or spinal gray matter, free in the subarach-
noidal hemorrhages, or within the choroid plexuses
(Table 2). However, many fat emboli were observed
within the veins and lymphatics of the epidural retia
surrounding the spinal cord. Epidural adipocytes as-
sociated with hemorrhaging were enlarged or ruptured.
Adipocytes adjacent to the ophthalmic plexus, thyroid
capsule, ovaries, and intestinal serosae were similarly
affected.
Histologically, all lungs studied had fat emboli
widely distributed within the small veins and capillar-
ies (Figs. 10, 11). The fat emboli varied considerably
in shape, with rounded and branching profiles. The
size of fat emboli depended on the vessels in which
they were located. Lymph nodes of the head and neck
contained many fat emboli in the subcapsular areas
sometimes in large numbers. Variably sized, fat stain–
negative vacuoles, which were presumed to be air em-
boli, were observed in some lymph nodes, together
with fat emboli. The kidneys had only a few fat emboli
in small medullary veins. With the exception of one
fat emboli in a cardiac arteriole (BW-10), fat emboli
were observed only in veins.
For comparison, 86 archived samples of fresh lungs
from different species of cetaceans that had been
stranded on the Canary Islands were checked for fat
emboli (data not shown). Only six showed intravas-
cular fat emboli, and two of these were sperm whales
that died after ship collision. The other four whales
consisted of one stranded BW and an aged Globice-
phala macrorrhychus, for which the causes of death
were not determined, and two pigmy sperm whales
with skull fractures.
No bacterial pathogens were isolated on routine aer-
obic bacterial cultures of the brain, lung, and spleen.
Discussion
Atypical mass strandings occurred previously off
the same coasts of the Canary Islands during naval
exercises carried out in 1985, 1988, and 1989,61,67 but
no postmortem studies were conducted. Similar strand-
ings have been reported in the past two decades in
Greece and in the Bahamas.1,17 Some common epide-
miologic factors are notable among these strandings:
(1) the oceanographic features were characteristic of
steep-slope regions; (2) the species involved were pre-
dominantly BWs; and (3) these events were temporally
associated with naval maneuvers that employed high-
intensity, low- or midfrequency range sonar sig-
nals.11,17 These observations have been interpreted to
suggest that BWs are found in association with partic-
ular oceanographic features and that they are either
behaviorally or physiologically susceptible to the ef-
fects of sound exposure from certain types of anthro-
pogenic sonar systems.
In the Greek stranding17 and the stranding reported
in this study, animals were in good body condition,
without external lesions of collision trauma, and they
had stomachs full of fresh ingesta. Conjunctival hem-
orrhages were common. In the Bahamas mass strand-
ing of 2000, 3 of the 5 BWs were examined. These
animals were in good body condition with food in their
stomachs. The two freshest specimens had subcapsular
renal hemorrhages, bilateral intracochlear hemorrhag-
es, and unilateral temporal region and subarachnoid
hemorrhages with blood clots observed bilaterally in
the cerebral ventricles. It was concluded that these le-
sions were due to antemortem acoustic or pressure-
related trauma caused by exposure to midfrequency
sonar exposure.11
The gross and histopathologic evaluations reported
in this study indicate that the whales had no systemic,
inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic diseases. All
the animals had similar pathologic findings of gener-
alized congestion and acute, disseminated hemorrhag-
ing that mainly affected the CNS, acoustic jaw fat,
pharyngeal and laryngeal serosae, lungs, and kidneys.
Impact trauma was initially considered a possible
cause; however, with the exception of one whale with
postmortem shark bites (BW-9), external trauma was
not noted.
The clinicopathologic findings most similar to those
of the animals of our study are those reported in acute
DCS in human divers,16,20,30,46,47 animals experimentally
exposed to compression and decompression,18,37,38,59,63
or animals exposed to underwater explosions.32,39,64
According to navy sources, no explosions occurred
during the naval exercise; thus, another energy source

is thought to be the primary trigger of the pathogenic
process involved in this event.
Detection of antemortem gas bubble accumulation
within blood vessels and tissues can be difficult to
demonstrate after death, because gases can dissolve
back into surrounding tissues when the inciting injury
ceases.31,38 Although many of the lesions noted in this
study are those associated with the systemic gas bub-
ble injuries that occur in acute cases of DCS in humans
and laboratory animals,3,16,18,26,33,36,37,46,58,59 a diagnosis
of DCS through identification of intravascular bubbles
is made with caution.
The pathogenesis of fat emboli formation is still not
fully understood, and it is likely multifactorial.24 Fat
embolism is infrequently diagnosed, but it has been
described in cases of acute and subacute DCS.26,29,31 It
may arise from a number of different traumatic and
nontraumatic processes.24,43,49,62 Pulmonary and sys-
temic fat emboli that develop within hours of trauma
are typically considered a consequence of injury to fat
depots.24,62 Fat embolism also may occur by the coa-
lescence of chylomicrons and intralipid liposomes in
plasma during stress.24 In both cases, intravascular lip-
id emboli can be demonstrated in several organs using
histochemical methods on formalin-fixed tissues col-
lected years earlier.2,7,51 To our knowledge, this study
provides the first description of fat emboli in ceta-
ceans.13,25
Acute hemorrhaging in fat with necrosis of adipo-
cytes, fat emboli in the lungs, epidural veins, and head
and neck lymph nodes were identified in the freshest
carcasses examined. These findings are similar to those
observed with rapid fat emboli onset shortly after in-
jury.10,24,31,49 Embolus distribution suggests that injured
adipose tissue is the primary source. The large number
of fat droplets and erythrocytes within the draining
lymph nodes of the head and neck indicates this area
was primarily affected by the pathologic process. No
fat emboli were found within the vessels of the CNS
or associated with hemorrhages in the cerebral sub-
arachnoid spaces. It is presumed that the large vascular
plexuses (including epidural and thoracic retia mira-
bilia) could protect the CNS from accumulating gas
and fat emboli.41 This hypothesis is supported by the
observation that in BWs, disrupted adipocytes were
often observed in association with hemorrhages, and
fat emboli were observed within the epidural veins
around the cervical spinal cord. The disruption of in-
terstitial fat depots adjacent to veins could result from
nitrogen bubble formation and growth and from tissue
rupture that introduces both fat and gas into the venous
blood stream, processes that are suspected of contrib-
uting to bubble formation in human DCS and in ex-
perimental animals after decompression.18,26,29,30
The low numbers of fat emboli found in the kidney
were discovered in the medullary capillaries. Neither
fat nor gas emboli were observed in glomeruli, imply-
ing that they were not circulating in the arterial blood
delivered to the kidneys or that the renal circulation
was shut down as in a dive mode.21 Fat emboli were
not associated with hemorrhages beneath the kidney
capsule, where distended veins and disrupted capsular
and interlobular connective tissue with large, nonfat-
staining vacuoles (gas bubbles) were noted. It is spec-
ulated that the nitrogen bubble development observed
in this study was merely nitrogen bubble escape from
nitrogen-saturated tissues into free spaces and veins
either by static or rectified diffusion.6,23
From the lack of published reports of stranded ce-
taceans (several hundreds of 15 different species) and
on the basis of the experience of personnel in the Ca-
nary Islands and the UK (more than 2,000 cetaceans
of several species), the incidence of fat emboli is pre-
sumed to be low in most of the species studied. A
whale’s agonal activity while stranded on the beach, a
common scenario, does not commonly induce fat em-
boli. The distribution of fat emboli presented in this
study, relative to other stranded cetaceans, and the con-
ditions required for fat emboli development suggest
that the generation of fat emboli in this study likely
occurred before the animals became stranded. Further
evidence that supports this conclusion is the observa-
tion that three whales with fat emboli were not strand-
ed on the beach but were recovered offshore. Also,
observations performed by the personnel present at the
strandings indicated that animals were severely
shocked and dying rapidly. The first dead animals were
found 4 hours after the use of sonar began, so there
was little time for the moribund whales to have de-
veloped the antemortem lesions while on the beach or
rocks. These observations suggest the animals were
severely injured before beaching and that gas and fat
emboli were related to the injury and not secondary to
the stranding event.
Although DCS is not always lethal, if severe, it can
be rapidly fatal, or it can result in a more protracted
syndrome leading to death.16,29,31 Gas and fat emboli
can cause nervous and cardiovascular dysfunctions, re-
spiratory distress, pain, and disorientation. These signs

DCS16,18,24,27,30,36 may have been the main pathophysi-
ologic process leading to the death and/or stranding of
these BWs.
The mechanism of development of emboli remains
to be determined. Three pathways were previously
proposed for the development of the lesions observed
in BWs that became stranded in the Bahamas: reso-
nance, tissue diathesis, and acoustically mediated bub-
ble formation.11,23,44 Resonance and tissue diathesis
could account for hemorrhagic trauma and fat emboli
evolution, but they do not explain the presence of gas
emboli or the distribution of hemorrhage and fat em-
boli within multiple tissues and organs. Acoustically
mediated bubble formation provides a possible expla-
nation for the observed lesions.6,14,23,25
Bubbles may grow via rectified diffusion, which is
the growth or generation of bubbles driven by expo-
sure to an acoustic field.6,23 Rectified diffusion includes
the growth of bubbles through the diffusion of gas in
the absence of a continuous acoustic exposure. Ac-
cording to this theory, the acoustic source destabilizes
existing bubble nuclei, which grow due to the outflow
of gas from gas-saturated tissues.6,23 Another proposed
mechanism is that BWs are startled by an intense
acoustic exposure and modify their surfacing behavior.
In this way, supersaturation and the probability of bub-
ble formation are increased due to changes from their
normal dive profiles.14,23,25,45
Because nitrogen is more soluble in lipids than in
other biologic tissue, there would be a propensity for
bubble growth in lipid-rich tissue.13,18,23,24,26,29,30,44 The
postprandial and presumably hyperlipidemic state of
these whales may have favored lipid aggregation in
blood. A greater degree of supersaturation should de-
crease the threshold for these putative processes.
Dolphins and human divers are known to develop
relatively high levels of nitrogen supersaturation re-
sulting from cycles of compression and decompression
during repetitive, breath-hold diving.6,23,52,56 However,
dolphins (and presumably other cetaceans) have
evolved adaptations that mitigate the accumulation of
excess nitrogen in tissues.21,34,50,54,56,57 The most notable
adaptation is lung or alveolar collapse, which stops gas
exchange at the depth when alveoli collapse.21,56,57 In
the presence of an intense energy field, the degree of
tissue saturation required for bubble formation may
decrease.6,23 It has been hypothesized that BWs should
have a greater degree of tissue–nitrogen saturation than
most cetaceans because of their slow and deep-diving
behavior.22,23,65
Damage to the acoustic fat of the head may provide
clues to understanding the etiology of the observed
lesions. Sound impulses are thought to be directed to
the ear via the specialized acoustic fat channels of the
lower jaw.21 Hemorrhages were observed in the fatty
acoustic channels of the jaw of all atypically mass-
stranded BWs. Strong acoustic signals will affect these
well-vascularized lipid-rich channels and could result
in rapid bubble activation. Such a situation could result
in rapid bubble activation driven by both tissue nitro-
gen off-gassing and continued acoustic exposure.6,23
The development of gas bubbles within tissues
could have produced hemorrhages and necrosis, acute
spongiotic changes in the CNS, and gas/fat venous em-
bolism. Some of these lesions occur during the initial
phases of acute DCS and DON lesions in humans and
experimental animals and in these mass-stranded
BWs.18,26,29,30,59,63
Gas and fat emboli released into the venous system
and deposited in the pulmonary capillary beds may
travel through arteriovenous shunts into the systemic
circulation.16 Respiratory and cardiovascular dysfunc-
tions may occur with a biphasic response at the brain–
spinal cord level: an initial venous embolic obstruction
and vasoconstriction, followed by a secondary vaso-
dilatation and prolonged (reactive) hyperemia.60 This
hemodynamic process may explain the widespread ce-
rebral congestion and edema with spongiosis, intracra-
nial perivascular hemorrhages, and subarachnoid and
intraventricular hemorrhages that have been described
in the BW mass strandings.
Unfortunately, evaluation of portomesenteric vas-
culature was not performed; however, the gas bubbles
observed in liver sinusoids are similar to those report-
ed in portomesenteric vessels following decompres-
sion in humans4,48 and in experimental DCS in dogs.3
Subsequently, these acute lesions have been found by
our group in two recently single-stranded BWs (M.
densirostris) (unpublished observation) and have been
observed in stranded cetaceans in the UK.25
Gas embolism in the inner ear has been described
in DCS.27,36 Emboli may induce otic hemorrhages and
contribute to disorientation and/or vestibular dysfunc-
tion. Similar lesions have been described in other, so-
nar-associated mass strandings of whales.11 Investiga-
tors should carefully dissect and sample ear structures
to more completely document the potential contribu-
tion of fat and gas emboli in otic tissues to this strand-
ing syndrome.
In summary, this study presents lesions in cetaceans
that are similar to those of acute decompression-like
disease in humans and laboratory animals. Evidence
of gas bubbles, presumably nitrogen, is presented, and
vascular and tissue changes consistent with those
caused by gas bubble injuries and fat emboli were
demonstrated in the vital organs of BWs from an atyp-
ical mass stranding. The stranding was temporally and
spatially coincident with a naval exercise employing
midfrequency sonar. The animals were presumed to
have died or to have been stranded with a DCS-like

disease and died shortly after with severe cardiovas-
cular failure brought on by ‘‘stranding stress syn-
drome.’’9,11 Researchers aware of the syndrome of gas
bubbles and fat emboli should be better prepared to
document the lesions in the event of similar mass
strandings.
Gas and fat emboli should be considered in stranded
cetaceans suspected of having been exposed to sonar.
Comparative data should be collected from unexposed
controls to gather evidence about the conditions and
mechanisms by which acoustic exposure induces le-
sions. Further investigation of the behavioral19,45,65 and
physiologic effects of sonar on cetaceans is important
to elucidating the pathogenesis of this syndrome.
