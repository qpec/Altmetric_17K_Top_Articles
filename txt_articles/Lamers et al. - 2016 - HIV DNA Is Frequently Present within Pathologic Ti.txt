ABSTRACT
HIV infection treatment strategies have historically defined effectiveness through measuring patient plasma HIV RNA. While
combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) can reduce plasma viral load (pVL) to undetectable levels, the degree that HIV is elimi-
nated from other anatomical sites remains unclear. We investigated the HIV DNA levels in 229 varied autopsy tissues from 20
HIV-positive (HIV�) cART-treated study participants with low or undetectable plasma VL and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VL
prior to death who were enrolled in the National Neurological AIDS Bank (NNAB) longitudinal study and autopsy cohort. Ex-
tensive medical histories were obtained for each participant. Autopsy specimens, including at least six brain and nonbrain tis-
sues per participant, were reviewed by study pathologists. HIV DNA, measured in tissues by quantitative and droplet digital
PCR, was identified in 48/87 brain tissues and 82/142 nonbrain tissues at levels >200 HIV copies/million cell equivalents. No
participant was found to be completely free of tissue HIV. Parallel sequencing studies from some tissues recovered intact HIV
DNA and RNA. Abnormal histological findings were identified in all participants, especially in brain, spleen, lung, lymph node,
liver, aorta, and kidney. All brain tissues demonstrated some degree of pathology. Ninety-five percent of participants had some
degree of atherosclerosis, and 75% of participants died with cancer. This study assists in characterizing the anatomical locations
of HIV, in particular, macrophage-rich tissues, such as the central nervous system (CNS) and testis. Additional studies are
needed to determine if the HIV recovered from tissues promotes the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, such as HIV-associ-
ated neurocognitive disorders, cancer, and atherosclerosis.
IMPORTANCE
It is well-known that combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) can reduce plasma HIV to undetectable levels; however, cART cannot
completely clear HIV infection. An ongoing question is, “Where is HIV hiding?” A well-studied HIV reservoir is “resting” T cells,
which can be isolated from blood products and succumb to cART once activated. Less-studied reservoirs are anatomical tissue samples,
which have unknown cART penetration, contain a comparably diverse spectrum of potentially HIV-infected immune cells, and are
important since <2% of body lymphocytes actually reside in blood. We examined 229 varied autopsy specimens from 20 HIV� partici-
pants who died while on cART and identified that >50% of tissues were HIV infected. Additionally, we identified considerable pathol-
ogy in participants’ tissues, especially in brain, spleen, lung, lymph node, liver, aorta, and kidney. This study substantiates that tissue-
associated HIV is present despite cART and can inform future studies into HIV persistence.
O
ver 30 years ago, HIV infection and its clinical manifestation,
AIDS, emerged as a worldwide epidemic. Since then, signif-
icant progress has been achieved in understanding the causes of
HIV pathogenesis in the context of drug treatments that extend
patients’ lives by years or decades. Current combined antiretrovi-
ral therapy (cART) regimens encompass a variety of drugs that are
focused on inhibiting viral replication, which allows for the recov-
ery of a healthy CD4� T cell population (1). However, even with
carefully monitored cART, pathological trajectories are variable
among patients (2–4), as are the adverse effects of therapy (5–10).
Complex and difficult-to-measure patient attributes that may af-
fect the efficacy of cART include psychological conditions (e.g.,
depression and drug or alcohol abuse), adherence to drug treat-
ment requirements, availability of social support systems, and
coping strategies (11). In addition, two major problems have
emerged in HIV-positive (HIV�) persons with long-term expo-
sure to cART: (i) many patients develop serious “non-AIDS-de-
fining” conditions, including cancer, atherosclerosis, and neuro-
cognitive disorders, at much higher rates than in comparable
uninfected populations (12–15), and (ii) the virus is never com-
pletely eradicated (16), as interruption in drug therapy results in
the rapid rebound of replicating virus in plasma.

 Since the introduction of cART, the therapeutic goal of virus
eradication has been complicated by the emergence of drug-resis-
tant variants and the inability to prevent viral rebound after cART
discontinuation. The persistence of very low levels of HIV in
plasma of cART-treated patients has suggested the presence of a
cell-based “viral reservoir.” Viral reservoirs contain infected cells
that do not release infectious virus (i.e., are latently infected), but
can do so following activation, which may occur under a variety of
conditions (17, 18). Virus production from latently infected cells
is believed to occur in the absence of new rounds of surrounding
cell infection (19–21). Currently, HIV latency is primarily attrib-
uted to the presence of proviral HIV DNA in resting memory
CD4� T cells (18). These cells can live for long periods, contribute
to low-level persistent viremia during cART and viral rebound
after treatment interruption, and produce viral variants with es-
cape mutations (17, 22). However, it is important to consider that
less than 2% of the total body lymphocyte population resides in
peripheral blood (23), suggesting that evaluation of HIV infection
in anatomical sanctuary sites is of critical importance, e.g., char-
acterization of compartmentalized HIV in tissue reservoirs such as
the brain (24, 25). Further, there is controversy over whether these
sanctuary tissues contain significant pools of latent virus in cells
other than memory T cells and whether these cells could contrib-
ute to viral rebound.
HIV infects a number of different cell types that reside in tis-
sues, including T cells, macrophages, monocytes, astrocytes, mi-
croglia, and dendritic cells (26–29). Cellular viral reservoirs may
include immature memory T cell populations with stem cell-like
properties (CD4� T memory stem cells) and monocytes/macro-
phages (30–33). Tissue macrophages, despite being infected at
much lower levels than CD4� T cells (34), are a particularly im-
portant pathogenic target of the virus due to the role of macro-
phages in signaling other immune cells to sites of infection and
damage (26, 35–37), which can contribute to HIV-associated co-
morbidities (34, 36, 38). Moreover, resident tissue macrophages
are long-lived and may naturally produce low levels of virus.
HIV� perivascular macrophages and macrophage-like microglia
(39, 40) in the brain have been associated with the emergence of
antiretroviral drug resistance (41, 42) and HIV-associated neuro-
cognitive disorders (HAND) (43, 44). HIV� patients may also
harbor viral populations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that are ge-
netically distinct from virus in the blood (45–50) and that exhibit
characteristics of macrophage/microglia tropism (51). Thus, ana-
tomical sites and/or cell types that harbor viral populations with
low replication potential may contribute to the formation of a
viral reservoir during primary infection (52, 53). Yet the degree to
which cART clears HIV from anatomical tissue reservoirs is un-
known, and the relationship between persistent HIV in tissues and
tissue damage has never been carefully examined.
Here, we describe extensive background, clinical, and patho-
logical findings in an HIV-infected longitudinal cohort of 20 par-
ticipants who received cART and died with undetectable VL in
body fluids. A total of 229 tissues from varied anatomical sites
were isolated from participants at autopsy, each of which was his-
tologically examined and assayed for the presence of HIV DNA. In
an accompanying study (54), we generated env-nef DNA and RNA
sequences from anatomical tissues from a subset of these partici-
pants in order to determine if HIV was evolving in these sites
during cART. The results from these studies provide key insights
into the effect of cART on residual HIV infection in tissues.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
General protocols for participants enrolled at the NNAB. The Na-
tional Neurological AIDS Bank (NNAB) is a member of the National
NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC). The NNTC was founded in
1998 to respond to researchers’ need for well-characterized HIV-1-in-
fected (HIV�) human tissues and fluid samples, and to study the mecha-
nisms of HIV-associated neurological diseases (55). The NNAB uses stan-
dardized NNTC protocols to assess and classify neurocognitive
impairment in living HIV� participants and to assign neurological and
psychiatric diagnoses according to established criteria (55–57). Partici-
pants are asked to donate blood and urine samples at each study visit, as
well as optional CSF specimens, in accordance with NNTC protocols. In
addition, the NNAB site collects data on comorbid systemic diseases in
living HIV� persons, such as cancer, hypertension, lipodystrophy, hyper-
lipidemia, diabetes, pulmonary, cerebrovascular, cardiac, renal, and other
diseases, and samples a wide array of postmortem nonneurological organs
and tissues whenever possible.
NNAB participants. NNAB participants are recruited from the
greater Los Angeles, CA, area. An institutional review board (IRB)-ap-
proved informed consent is obtained from each participant or his or her
legal guardian. Eligibility criteria are as follows. Participants must be aged
18 years or older and agree to participate in study examinations and do-
nation of blood, urine, and (optional) CSF during life and to donate their
brain and other tissues for research in the event of their death. HIV�
participants are selected because they have one or more of the following: a
CD4� cell count of �50 cells/mm3, systemic lymphoma or another wide-
spread malignancy, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, wasting
with loss of �30% of body weight, primary central nervous system (CNS)
lymphoma, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, congestive
heart failure, chronic renal failure with potential or current need for dial-
ysis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, end-stage liver disease, se-
rum albumin of �3.2 g/dl, or any condition which, in the opinion of the
study physician, is likely to lead to death within the period of study. In
2013, the criteria were amended to recruit a limited number of older
(age � 60 years) HIV� participants. There are no exclusions based on
race, ethnicity, language, immigration status, socioeconomic status, gen-
der, substance use, or sexual preference. Most participants are recruited
premortem; however, the remains of very recently deceased individuals
could be donated by the legal heirs, in which case information is obtained
from the guardians and/or by authorized release of medical records.
Cohort information, questionnaires, and general medical assess-
ments. All study material was collected and coded in accordance with The
University of California, Los Angeles, IRB (approval number 10-000525-
CR-0005) and NNAB protocols to protect the participant’s confidential-
ity. Consent, study materials, and questionnaires were all administered in
a standard format in either English or Spanish. Whenever possible, par-
ticipants (and/or their legal representatives) consented and were enrolled

 prior to the participant’s death and received the following: serial standard-
ized NNTC neuromedical, neuropsychological, psychiatric, and sub-
stance use inventories and examination, a comorbidity questionnaire,
blood testing for CD4� subsets and plasma viral load (pVL), and urine
toxicology testing for substance abuse. Participants were also offered op-
tional CSF collection. Most participants were also tested for syphilis and
hepatitis C virus (HCV) serology once at entry. In all cases, participants or
their legal guardians were asked to sign an IRB-approved release of med-
ical information. Participants were scheduled for serial return visits based
in part on their level of illness (sicker participants were seen more often
and at shorter intervals) and their availability (several participants were
unable to come in for various reasons, e.g., travel or incarceration). Some
participants were unable or unwilling to complete the full battery due to
their terminal illness or refusal by the participant or guardian. Some par-
ticipants in this cohort were apparently medically stable HIV� persons
who were not deemed to be candidates for NNAB, specifically because
they appeared healthy, but who expired suddenly and unexpectedly and
were enrolled by their family immediately after their demise. This group
included some cases extremely noteworthy precisely because these HIV�
participants were not deemed to be at high risk for death and had a history
of good medical adherence, stable CD4� cell counts, and persistently low
or undetectable plasma viral loads as documented by their personal phy-
sicians.
Demographic information was collected for each participant, includ-
ing date of birth, age at death, gender (male, female, or transgender),
ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino or not), race (white, black/African-American,
Asian, Native Alaskan/American Indian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Is-
lander, other or mixed), education in years, highest degree obtained, read-
ing level, and mode(s) of exposure (male-to-male sex [MSM], intrave-
nous drug use [IDU], heterosexual transmission, blood product, health
care accident, and perinatal, other, and unknown mode of transmission).
Participants who were examined premortem were asked to complete a
standardized medical and neurological history covering comorbidities
(e.g., hypertension; cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, and cerebrovascu-
lar diseases; diabetes; hyperlipidemia; lipodystrophy; non-AIDS-defining
malignancies; and tobacco smoking), AIDS-defining illnesses, and neuro-
logical history (head injury, loss of consciousness, learning disorders, sei-
zures, other neurological diseases, and targeted cognitive, sensory, and
motor symptoms). Neurological examinations at the NNAB were per-
formed by two board-certified academic neurologists who specialize in
neuro-AIDS. This included administration of the Mini-Mental Status
Exam and HIV Dementia Scale (HDS) and a targeted examination of
cranial nerves, motor systems, coordination, reflexes, and sensation. Neu-
ropsychological testing was performed in English or Spanish by a trained
neuropsychometry technician under the supervision of a board-certified
neuropsychologist with expertise in HIV. This included a standardized set
of neuropsychological tests; a psychiatric and substance abuse inventory
based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, 4th
edition (DSM-IV) (58; http://www.dsm4.org), the Composite Interna-
tional Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) (59, 60), or the Psychiatric Research
Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders (PRISM) (61); and the
Beck Depression Inventory—second edition (BDI) (62). The Spanish
neuropsychological testing varies slightly from the English version in that
the Spanish version of the HDS was scored according to slightly different
norms and the Test de Vocabulario en Imagenes Peabody (TVIP) (63) was
used to determine verbal ability and reading level (64). There was also an
abbreviated “step-down” battery, which is used for participants who are
too ill to complete the full battery.
Whenever possible, a urine sample was obtained at each visit to screen
for substances of abuse; a blood draw was requested at each visit for com-
plete blood count (CBC), including white blood count, hemoglobin, he-
matocrit, and platelet count; CD4� cell subsets; pVL, serum albumin (at
entry only); HCV serology (at entry only); and rapid plasma regain eval-
uation for syphilis serology (at entry only). The remainder of the sample
was frozen and stored as plasma, serum, and (nonviable) peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs). An optional lumbar puncture was requested
for all participants who were deemed appropriate (on the basis of the
neurological exam, blood work, and any available neuroimaging) and to
be at low risk for complications. If collected, CSF was measured for cell
count, glucose, total protein, VDRL testing, and CSF HIV load (csfVL);
the remaining supernatant was frozen. The nadir absolute CD4� cell
count was defined as the lowest known absolute CD4� cell count as de-
termined by chart review and/or participant recollection. The duration of
known HIV infection was calculated using the reported first date of HIV-
seropositive diagnosis and the date of the participant’s death. In most
cases, the participant did not know the exact date that they acquired HIV
infection.
Twenty-patient subset of the NNAB general program. Twenty par-
ticipants were identified from the 246-participant NNAB cohort who fit
the following criteria: (i) were HIV�, (ii) died while on cART or had only
a brief interval before death when they did not take cART, (iii) had doc-
umented premortem history of low or undetectable pVL, (iv) had an
autopsy within a 24-h period after death (called the postmortem interval
[PMI]), and (v) had VL measurements from both postmortem aspiration
of cardiac fluid that had been centrifuged to remove debris (note: this is
not a true pVL, because true plasma is unobtainable after death) and
postmortem CSF (collected by aspiration from the lumbar sac or cerebral
ventricle). Aggressive efforts were made to review the participants’ med-
ical records to collect additional information, with the emphasis on the
participants’ cART regimens and adherence, CD4� subsets, pVL, medical
comorbidities, and any clinical evaluations of their neurological or HIV-
related illnesses.
The last date of cART intake was estimated for each participant as
follows. If the participant expired in a hospital, a nursing facility, or hos-
pice, this information was obtained from the medical record. If the par-
ticipant expired at home and lived at home with a caregiver or partner, this
person was queried about the last cART dose the patient certainly ingested
(in such cases, the caregivers usually administered cART medications). If
the patient was living independently, we listed the last date they were
documented to report taking medications and whether there was any
reason to suspect they stopped them before death. The last methods were
used mostly for sudden, unexpected deaths of persons who were in out-
patient care and deemed to be doing well.
The PMI was calculated as follows. If the participant expired while
under direct observation (e.g., in a hospital or hospice), the PMI was
calculated as the interval between the exact time of death and the time the
brain was removed and placed on ice. If the participant was not observed
during the time of death, PMI was calculated from the last time a friend,
relative, neighbor, or health care worker contacted the participant until
the time the brain was removed and placed on ice.
Postmortem tissue harvesting was performed by an autopsy techni-
cian and reviewed by one or more board-certified pathologists with ex-
pertise in AIDS. All NNAB tissue samples selected for this particular study
were individually cut with fresh, unused surgical blades to avoid cross-
contamination of tissues within and among cases. Whenever possible, the
minimum organs harvested included the entire brain, the spinal cord, and
samples of peripheral nerve, striated muscle, spleen, lymph nodes, and
thymus. Most tissue harvests also included samples of heart, lung, renal,
and gastrointestinal (GI) tissue, encapsulated lymph nodes primarily
from the chest and/or abdominal cavity, and any organ, tissue, or fluid
that appeared clinically suspicious or appeared to contain an infectious or
malignant lesion.
Whenever possible, the technician aspirated a fluid sample from the
cardiac ventricles and postmortem CSF from either the lumbar sac or
cerebral ventricles. Brain and other tissues were divided into frozen
and/or formalin-fixed samples as described in the NNTC standard proto-
col (55). For this protocol, all fixed and/or frozen samples from different
anatomical tissue samples within and between each case were cut with a
new, unused surgical blade, which was then discarded to prevent inadver-
tent transfer of viral DNA among tissues. For initial histopathological

 examination of samples, formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin
and processed to hematoxylin and eosin slides as described by Morgello et
al. (55). Neuropathological slides were examined by one or more board-
certified academic neuropathologists with expertise in AIDS, and systemic
tissues were examined by a board-certified anatomical pathologist with
specialty in AIDS and in hematology-oncology. Additional stains or other
tests were ordered as needed based on the clinical history and initial his-
topathological findings. Criteria outlined by Budka et al. were used to
identify HIV encephalitis and other HIV-related CNS pathologies (65).
ACSR. The AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR) is a Na-
tional Cancer Institute-funded program that supplies specimens from
HIV� participants with cancer to investigators interested in AIDS malig-
nancy research. Researchers at the ACSR and NNAB have had a long-term
collaboration in evaluating the role of HIV infection in the pathogenesis
of HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Over the past 5 to 10 years, when it
became clear that AIDS patients were dying of complications from cancer
more than HAD, the collaboration expanded to provide samples from
participants with HIV infection and cancer to the ACSR. For this study,
the ACSR independently verified the tissue diagnoses made by the NNAB
and evaluated levels of VL in plasma, CSF, and other various tissues pro-
vided by the NNAB. All of the cases described here reside at both the ACSR
and the NNAB. The use of these materials is acknowledged to be a product
of both NIH-funded programs. This study was approved by the University
of California, San Francisco (IRB approval number 13-12020).
HIV detection protocols. (i) qPCR. Autopsy tissues with validated
pathology (n � 229) from 20 patients was used for evaluation of HIV
DNA content. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed by extracting
DNA from each tissue using a QIAamp DNA microkit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA) as per guidelines stated in the manufacturer’s handbook, and DNA
was eluted in 20 �l of Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer. The extracted DNA was
used to assay for HIV DNA using a quantitative multiplex real-time PCR
assay. Two standard curves were generated using a mixture of two plas-
mids containing a single copy of the gag gene (HXB2; GenBank accession
number K03455) and a single copy of the �-globin gene (GenBank acces-
sion number AF007546) in 1:10 dilutions starting at 1 � 106 and ending at
1 � 101 copies. All standards and samples were set up in triplicate, with
each containing 2� TaqMan Gene Expression master mix (Applied Bio-
systems, Foster City, CA), 1.25 pmol of gag primers (gag forward, GACATC
AAGCAGCCATGCAA, and gag reverse, CTCATCTGGCCTGGTGCAAT),
0.625 pmol of �-globin primers (�-globin forward, TCACTAGCAACCTCA
AACAGACACC, and �-globin reverse, AGGGCCTCACCACCAACTTC),
1.25 pmol of each probe (�-globin probe, VIC-CTCCTGAGGAGAAGTCT
GCCGTTACTGCC,andGagprobe,6-carboxyfluorescein[FAM]-ACCATC
AATGAGGAAGCTGCAGAATGGGA), 3 �l of the eluted DNA, and water
for a final volume of 10 �l. Samples were run in a StepOne real-time PCR
system (Applied Biosystems) as follows: 95°C for 15 min, followed by 40
cycles at 95°C for 1 min and at 60°C for 1 min, followed by analyses using
the StepOne real-time PCR system software. The copy numbers of each
gene within the unknowns were determined against the standard curves
generated by the plasmids. The copy numbers were used to calculate HIV
DNA copy numbers per cell. OM10.1, a promyelocytic cell line containing
approximately one copy of HIV per cell, was used as positive control;
HIV-negative DNA and water were used as negative controls.
(ii) ddPCR. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) utilized the primers from
our multiplex real-time qPCR assay that assessed the �-globin and gag
genes, in which a 111-bp gag segment and 109-bp �-globin gene segment
were amplified. Briefly, DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA mi-
crokit (Qiagen), as per guidelines stated in the manufacturer’s handbook,
and eluted in 20 �l of TE buffer. The extracted DNA was used in the
reaction mixture containing 2� ddPCR supermix for probes (no dUTP),
250 nM each primer, 250 nM each probe, 3 �l of DNA, and H2O for a final
volume of 20 �l that was put into the droplet generator cartridge along
with 70 �l of droplet reader oil. The droplet generator cartridge was then
loaded into the QX200 droplet generator (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and 40
�l of the droplets was transferred into a 96-well plate and loaded into the
thermocycler for PCR with the following cycling parameters: 95°C for 10
min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, and 60°C for 1 min. After PCR, the plate
was loaded into the QX200 droplet reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), which
analyzes each individual droplet and determines copy numbers using
QuantaSoft software. These numbers were used to calculate HIV DNA
copy per million cells. The promyelocytic cell line OM10.1 was used as a
positive control; HIV-negative DNA and H2O were used as negative con-
trols. The limit of detection from both approaches was 200 copies per 1
million cells. Paired t tests were performed to determine any significant
correlations between qPCR and ddPCR results. Also, paired t tests were
performed to determine any significant correlations between ddPCR re-
sults and histopathological findings.
(iii) SGS. In order to test whether the HIV present in tissues could
encode functional intact viral proteins that would show evidence for on-
going evolution, RNA and genomic DNA was isolated from selected tis-
sues from five participants. A modified single-genome sequencing (SGS)
protocol was used to amplify linked HIV env and nef sequences (66). env
and nef alignments were generated, and maximum-likelihood phylog-
enies and Bayesian time-scaled analysis were used to elucidate sequence
diversity/evolution in participant sequence data sets. These methods and
expanded results are provided in precise detail in reference 54.
RESULTS
Subject demographics. Seventeen male and 3 female HIV� par-
ticipants were included in the study (Table 1). Sixteen participants
had a PMI of 10 h or less, and the average PMI for the cohort was
7.77 h. The cohort reported a mix of HIV risk factors, with 10
participants likely contracting HIV by MSM, 3 through heterosex-
ual transmission, 3 through IDU, and 1 through an infected blood
product; 3 participants reported two or more risk factors. Three
participants were enrolled postmortem into the NNAB program.
The median age of the participants was 46.5 years, and the median
length of known infection was 12 years (Fig. 1).
Medical histories. (i) Antiretroviral histories. Detailed treat-
ment history, including last known cART dose, was obtained ei-
ther from a medical facility or from questioning the caregiver at
the time of death and was available for all participants (see Table
S1 in the supplemental material). To the best of our ability, we
determined that 11 of the participants were on cART until death.
Of the remaining participants, four may have stopped their med-
ications within 4 weeks of death and three within 8 weeks of death,
and two had their last prescribed cART dose 4 months prior to
death. While we have no records to show cART adherence imme-
diately prior to death in these nine participants, compliance is
likely due to their low viral loads at autopsy, as HIV rapidly re-
bounds during treatment interruption (67–69).
(ii)VLandCD4�cellmeasurements.VLdataforthecohortat
death (in CSF and cardiac aspirates) and the last living pVL mea-
sured were obtained for each patient (Table 2). One of the require-
ments for inclusion in this study was a nondetectable VL in a fluid
sample from the cardiac ventricles and postmortem CSF from
either the lumbar sac or cerebral ventricles. The limit of detection
for premortem CSF and plasma VL varied according to the year
that the sample was collected, as these were assayed immediately.
In some cases, a low-level HIV infection was identified in the CSF,
which may have been due to inadequate CNS penetration efficacy
of the cART regimen, CNS mutations, or an independent source
of replication in the CNS. For example, participant 6015’s last
known living pVL was close to 9,000 copies/mm3, 15 months prior
to death. While we do not have detailed information concerning
her cART intake in the months prior to death, she was prescribed
didanosine (ddI), saquinavir, ritonavir, stavudine, and nevirapine

 8 weeks prior to death. Because her last CD4� cell count was 407
cells/mm3 just prior to death, she had no detectable viral load in
the cardiac aspirate, and she was administered her medications by
a nurse in a nursing facility, adherence was extremely likely. Par-
ticipants 4179, 5025, and 5095 also retained a low-level HIV in-
fection in CSF at death. Participant 4143 had a low-level residual
HIV VL of 258 copies/mm3 in cardiac aspirate at autopsy; how-
ever, hospital records indicated that he continued to take cART
until 3 days prior to his death from lymphoma.
(iii) CD4� cell measurements (median, range, and outliers) for
the participants were low and showed considerable ranges of dis-
tribution (Fig. 2), although they should be interpreted with a de-
gree of caution since per study protocols, less healthy participants
were seen more often and at shorter intervals; therefore, CD4� cell
count was measured in the participants when it would expectedly
be low due to illness, such as during intercurrent infections.
Patient timelines. Extensive research was devoted to recon-
structing each participant’s medical history from the time of HIV
diagnosis to death (condensed in Fig. 3 to 5). One clear observa-
tion from these data is that all participants presented with numer-
ous serious pathologies during their course of infection despite
cART. In some cases, this could be attributed to poor recovery of
immune function as indicated by CD4� cell count, and in other
cases this could be ascribed to so-called “non-AIDS-defining” pa-
thologies associated with long-term HIV infection and treatment.
Fourteen of the participants in the cohort were diagnosed with at
least one type of cancer prior to death, including basal cell carci-
noma, prostate cancer, anal carcinoma, stomach cancer, Kaposi’s
sarcoma (KS; both dermal and visceral), a variety of lymphomas,
brain cancers, and lung cancer. Other pathologies observed in the
cohort included neurological disorders, miscellaneous infections,
and organ diseases.
Although cART adherence varied among participants, most
were compliant throughout their treatment program. Here we
describe the medical histories of three participants with high
cART adherence over the course of their HIV infection in order to
demonstrate the detailed historical information available for all 20
participants. Participant 2004 (Fig. 3) was an HIV� male with a
reported history of substance abuse and MSM. In the late 1970s he
was diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma, which was successfully
treated. Over the course of his life he was also diagnosed with and
treated for numerous basal cell carcinomas. He was diagnosed
with HIV in the mid-1980s and was subsequently treated for
thrush and cytomegalovirus (CMV). In the late 1990s he was re-
cruited to the NNAB, and neurocognitive testing indicated a mild
neurocognitive disorder. He was treated with lamivudine, indina-
vir, and nevirapine. He remained on cART until his death (further

 cART details are provided in Table S1 in the supplemental mate-
rial). After cART initiation, at least three blood tests indicated an
undetectable plasma viral load. One year prior to death he was
treated for bacterial pneumonia, hypertension, asthma, and hypo-
gonadism. Subsequently, he developed wasting syndrome and
rheumatoid arthritis. His CD4� cell count was 134 to 239 cells/
mm3 during this time and his pVL remained undetectable. At the
time of death, he was taking the following cART: lamivudine, aba-
cavir, nevirapine, fosamprenavir, and acyclovir. The participant
had no detectable VL in cardiac aspirate or CSF at autopsy, and his
last recorded CD4� cell count was 239 cells/mm3 19 days prior to
death. Postmortem pathological observations were as follows:
lung abscess with pulmonary edema, severe calcific aortic athero-
sclerosis with aortic aneurysm, necrotic liver with bile stasis, acute
inflammation of the spleen, lymphatic hyperplasia, and focal
myocardial fibrosis. Sections of the brain showed reactive astro-
cytes, abnormally large numbers of corpora amylacea, and
CD68� cells in the white matter. These findings are abnormal
but nonspecific. Death was ascribed to multiorgan disease, with
acute bronchopneumonia likely the terminal event.
Participant 4154 (Fig. 3) was a male who was diagnosed with
HIV infection in his mid-20s, with MSM as a risk factor. His CD4�
cell count was initially measured at 54 cells/mm3. For approxi-
mately 8 years after his diagnosis, medical records were unobtain-
able; however, he self-reported that during this time he was adher-
ent to cART and that he had at least one episode of Pneumocystis
jirovecii (formerly carinii) pneumonia (PCP). Eight years later, his
cART treatment included tenofovir, lamivudine, and efavirenz.

 His CD4� cell count was 41 cells/mm3, and pVL was 638 copies/
mm3. While on these medications, his only known complication
was oral candida. One and a half years later he stopped cART for a
short period and viral rebound ensued (VL � 100,000 copies/
mm3), with a corresponding drop in CD4� cells (CD4� cells � 20
cells/mm3). After an invasive nonkeratinizing squamous cell anal
carcinoma was identified, he resumed cART and his pVL re-
mained nearly undetectable until his death approximately 2 years
later. Fifteen months prior to death he was diagnosed with non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma and was treated with chemotherapy. After
hospitalization for esophageal pain, dysphagia, and fever, he went
into hospice care and remained on cART (epzicom, lexiva, norvir,
and intravenous [i.v.] foscarnet) until death, a result of diffuse
B-cell lymphoma.
Participant 4175 (Fig. 3) was a male with a history of IDU and
MSM and who denied any current drug, alcohol, or tobacco use.
He was first diagnosed with HIV when he was admitted to the
hospital with dyspnea and his CD4� cell count was 39 cells/mm3.
He began taking cART 5 weeks after his initial diagnosis. The
participant was also diagnosed with CMV, PCP, and KS (human
herpesvirus [HHV-8] positive on biopsy). He was treated with
paclitaxel for the KS. Two months later he had a biopsy of a neck
mass that was diagnosed as an extracavitary primary effusion lym-
phoma, and he was treated with EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone,
vincritine, cyclophosphamide, and hydroxyldaunorubicin). His
course was complicated by immune reconstitution inflammatory
syndrome (IRIS), as well as a monoclonal spike on serum protein
electrolysis (SPEP), hypothyroidism, asthma, genital herpes, deep
vein thrombosis, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Despite
cART compliance, the participant’s CD4� cell count remained

si’s sarcoma worsened in his lungs, and he developed a culture-
negative pneumonia. Respiratory failure followed and the patient
remained on a ventilator for a short period while taking broad-
spectrum antibiotics, paclitaxel, and cART until death due to ag-
gressive Kaposi’s sarcoma.
Autopsy findings: tissue histology and review of systems.
Histopathology reports revealed numerous tissue abnormalities
in tissues from all participants (Table 3); brain, lung, lymph node,
spleen, liver, kidney, and aorta tissues were frequently diseased.
The overall average number of major tissues with abnormal his-
tology was 7.26 tissues per subject, and the pathologist noted fewer
than six abnormal tissues for only one participant (6015). Almost
all tissues from participant 4124 demonstrated signs of disease.
Clinical notations of pathologies specific to the lungs, lymph
nodes, spleen, liver, kidneys, and heart are provided in Table 4.
Other organs with pathological findings included the aorta and
blood vessels, which in many participants were atherosclerotic.
Testes and ovary were atrophied in all cases for which a specimen
was available. The adrenals were noted in some cases as exhibiting
focal scarring, necrosis, large-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma, and metastatic carcinoma. Lower GI tissue was noted
in some cases as containing anal condyloma, squamous cell carci-
noma, and large cell lymphoma. In the stomach and upper gastro-
intestinal tract, gastritis, carcinoma and focal ulceration and in-
flammation were sometimes identified. Additional pathologies
included inflammation in the esophagus in participant 4130, lym-
phoma in the pancreas of participant 4143, diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma in the bone marrow of participant 4154, myeloid hy-
perplasia in the bone marrow of participant 5025, and metastatic
carcinoma in the thyroid of participant 5024.
Among the many pathologies that were diagnosed during each
participant’s lifetime, certain underlying pathologies were ob-
served in most participants (Table 5). Cancers were extremely
prevalent in the cohort: 14 of the participants were diagnosed with
cancer while living, and an additional participant (5095) was iden-
tified with renal cell carcinoma, plasmacytoma in lymph nodes,
and myeloma upon autopsy. Infections were also common (Fig. 3
to 5 and Table 5). Atherosclerosis was observed at autopsy in nu-
merous participants (Table 5).
The brain showed some degree of pathology in all participants
(Table 6). Abnormalities ranged from mild gliosis to encephalitis,

 netic resonance imaging (MRI) findings suggestive of HIV en-
cephalitis, exhibited thick blood vessel walls in the brain, perivas-
cular hemosiderin, pink neurons, decreased numbers of Purkinje
cells, and a potential early brain infarct. Participant 4013 com-
plained of neurocognitive problems starting in 1997, and al-
though two brain MRI scans from 1997 and mid 1998 were read as
normal, in late 1998 a research MRI scan showed diffuse white
matter changes and some atrophy. At autopsy, a preterminal sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage was noted along with Alzheimer’s type 2
gliosis. The latter refers to a histopathological change in astrocytes
characterized by enlarged nuclei, scant cytoplasm, and hyperac-
tive metabolism. Alzheimer’s type 2 gliosis (70) is usually in the
setting of chronic liver disease with hyperammonemia but can
also be seen in other metabolic diseases, such as heavy metal poi-
soning. Alzheimer’s type 2 gliosis is not related to Alzheimer’s
disease, which is histopathologically characterized by senile
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (71). For reasons that are un-
known, and possibly related to comorbid liver dysfunction, Alz-
heimer type 2 gliosis is a common finding in the NNAB HIV�
cohort. In the subgroup described here, Alzheimer’s type 2 gliosis
was found in 5 out of 20 brains. However, one elderly participant
(5025) did have some histopathological findings suggestive of Alz-
heimer’s disease.
Presence of HIV. (i) qPCR and ddPCR. HIV was measured in
229 tissues using both qPCR and ddPCR, including up to 9 non-
brain and 6 brain tissues from each case (see Table S2 in the sup-
plemental material). Only three discordant results (i.e., HIV am-
plified in one reaction but not the other) were found between the
two different HIV DNA quantitation techniques employed, and in
each of these cases the HIV copy number was low (�451 copies/
million cell equivalents [cp/mi]). Of the 229 tissues tested, HIV
DNA was identified in 48/87 brain tissues and 82/142 nonbrain
tissues. All participants had at least two HIV� tissues, and 18 to
100% of the tissues were HIV DNA positive with �200 cp/mi. The
low to high HIV DNA percent positivity hierarchy in tissues was
aorta (ddPCR range, 266 to 3,861 cp/mi) � lung (ddPCR range,
232 to 5,113 cp/mi) � brain (ddPCR range, 266 to 49,401 cp/
mi) � testis (ddPCR range, 268 to 577,778 cp/mi) � lymph node
(ddPCR range, 206 to 3,468 cp/mi) �spleen (ddPCR range, 283 to
9,091 cp/mi) � liver (ddPCR range, 518 to 9,722 cp/mi) � kidney
(ddPCR range, 416 to 5,315 cp/mi) � colon (ddPCR range, 726 to
23,377 cp/mi) (Fig. 6). The lowest quantifiable HIV copy number
measured was in the spleen of participant 4129 (ddPCR � 283
cp/mi), and the highest HIV copy was measured in testis of patient
2004 (ddPCR � 577,778 cp/mi). HIV positivity in the participants
was not ubiquitous across their tissue samples; for example, some
participants (4130, 4150, and 4010) had a number of HIV� non-
brain tissues and only one HIV� brain tissue, whereas participant
4175 had four HIV� brain tissues and outside the brain, the virus
was identified only in his aorta. The finding that all tissues from
patient 2004 were HIV� was interesting, considering our records
that indicated high cART adherence until death.

mean HIV copy numbers for ddPCR and qPCR (5,981.37 and

test (P � 0.0130). Due to the consideration that ddPCR is believed

(ii) HIV env-nef sequencing and evolutionary analysis. In or-
der to test if the HIV DNA detected in tissues through ddPCR
represented intact HIV genomes, a subset of tissues from five par-
ticipants was subjected to single-genome sequencing (SGS) of an
approximately 3,000-bp region of HIV that contains the HIV env-
nef genes. Subsequent to sequencing, extensive genetic analyses
were performed to investigate the viral diversity among tissue sites
and signatures of replication/evolution. Methods and results from
this analysis are presented in detail in reference 54. In brief, env-
nef DNA and/or RNA sequences were generated from 54% of the
ddPCR HIV� tissues assayed (n � 19) and at least one tissue for
four out of the five participants. The discordance between quan-
titative PCR and SGS assays is most likely due to the difference in
each assay’s sensitivity; however, it may be that some tissues con-
tained truncated or defective HIV sequences, which has been previ-
ouslydescribedforthebloodofpatientsonlong-termcART(73,74).
DISCUSSION
Despite long-term adherence to cART regimens, HIV� patients
continue to harbor replication-competent virus that remains hid-
den within cellular sanctuary sites (75–77), escaping both im-
mune surveillance and the effects of cART (27, 78). Some of these
sites of viral persistence are presently unidentified and prevent
complete eradication of the infection. Yet few studies have exam-
ined the degree and consequence of HIV infection in anatomical
sites other than blood during cART (17, 69, 79, 80), in large part
because obtaining tissue samples from living patients is difficult at
best. In this study, we collaborated with two NIH-funded tissue
banks (NNAB and ACSR) to study over 200 individual postmor-
tem tissues. The efficiency of the study staff involved in minimiz-
ing the time between death and tissue collection provided a well-
preserved set of characterized tissues, and the extensive records of
the NNAB provided comprehensive clinical details for each par-
ticipant. This unique collection thus allowed us to accurately
quantify the amount and anatomical locations of the virus.
Although it has been opined that the viral rebound during
structured cART interruption is not harmful, this has been con-
tradicted by the SMART study which demonstrated an increased
incidence of opportunistic infection and death in persons who
underwent structured treatment interruption compared to those
who did not, while not decreasing the adverse effects of antiretro-
viral therapy (68, 81, 82); however, these and similar studies fo-
cused primarily on viral rebound and subsequent viral suppres-
sion after cART reinitiation (83). Within this cohort, numerous
treatment interruptions, although due to patient adherence and
not medically controlled, were recorded and may have contrib-
uted to the wide range of subsequent pathologies. Other factors
that hypothetically may have contributed to the wide range of
pathology included the study inclusion criteria, late diagnosis in
some participants, late initiation of treatment in some partici-
pants, and concurrent substance use. Clearly, understanding the
effects of discontinuous cART on pathology-associated outcomes
deserves significantly more research.
Lymphoid tissues are the principal sites of HIV infection and
persistence (84, 85) and have been identified as a major site of viral
rebound (69). In our cohort, at least four cases existed where we
had precise information confirming cART adherence until death,
with each case having HIV� tissues at autopsy. One of these, par-
ticipant 2004, had quantifiable HIV in every tissue examined and,
furthermore, had the tissue with the highest levels of HIV detected
out of the entire set of tissues tested (testis; ddPCR value �
577,778 cp/mi). Therefore, we propose that while cART cessation
can lead to viral rebound in tissues, it is not the only factor con-
tributing to HIV persistence in anatomical sites. In terms of tissue
HIV positivity, it is also important to consider that only a small
amount of tissue from each organ was studied, and because HIV
presence is not apparently pervasive among tissues in an individ-
ual, our results likely greatly underestimate the actual HIV burden
in each anatomical site. More broad tissue-based studies such as
this could identify the anatomical sites that are the most consis-
tently HIV positive, which would be a great advantage for those
studying viral reservoirs.
Many participants were noted to have atherosclerotic vascular
disease at autopsy (Table 5). Plaque is macrophage rich and could
harbor replication-competent HIV or even protect infected cells
from cART targeting (86). In the cases where residual HIV was
identified in cancer participants, it may likewise be the case that
alternatively activated and anti-inflammatory macrophages,
which are linked to certain metastatic processes (87, 88), harbored
a low-level HIV infection that migrated to other sites. A recent
study elegantly demonstrated that HIV reprograms macrophage
migration, resulting in macrophage accumulation in patient tis-
sues, a key step for virus spread and pathogenesis (89). Tumor-
associated macrophages express vascular endothelial growth fac-
tors (36, 71), and while viral loads in blood and CSF were negative
for these participants, an interesting hypothesis is that the lym-
phatic system, which is more permeable than blood vessels for
immune cell migration, may be an alternate migratory pathway
for the dispersal of HIV virions or infected immune cells produced
by tumors or plaque during cART (87, 90–92). All participants in
the study had a degree of brain pathology (Table 6), and most had
quantifiable brain HIV DNA at autopsy, suggesting that brain
infection or even the damage caused by previous HIV assaults to
the brain may significantly contribute to ongoing disease, even the
non-brain-associated diseases noted in the cohort. Pre-cART,
brain-associated HIV was shown to reinfect the peripheral ana-
tomical sites (93); furthermore, it is well known that many cART
regimens fail to penetrate the CNS, and cases of CNS viral escape
have been recorded for living patients (66).
A comprehensive understanding of HIV-infected tissue mac-
rophages, to the extent that HIV� T cell subtypes have been stud-
ied, is still needed (26, 78). Previous studies by our group identi-
fied unique HIV evolutionary patterns and/or variants that exist
in pre-cART patient diseased tissues (94, 95). In these earlier stud-
ies, we identified an abundance of HIV recombinants (80), which
could arise due to superinfection of long-lived HIV-infected mac-
rophages. Furthermore, Mack et al. (96) found that a large variety
of diseased tissues derived from cART-negative autopsy tissues
from patients who died with AIDS lymphoma or AIDS dementia
contained amplifiable amounts of HIV DNA. In these tissues, p24
antigen staining was localized predominantly to macrophages in-

 terspersed in a background of p24-negative lymphocytes; this type
of staining was not seen in nondiseased tissues (96). These mac-
rophage p24-rich tissues contained HIV integrated within genetic
activation loci. Because persistent macrophage activation is asso-
ciated with an inhibition of apoptosis, HIV� macrophages likely
have a survival advantage, acting as a continuous source of HIV
and serving as a long-term site of viral persistence or viral rebound
after cART discontinuation (97). Considering the wide range of
macrophage-associated diseases (atherosclerosis, cancer, neuro-
logical disease) seen in this particular cohort, therapeutics that
target subsets of activated macrophages (98–100) or their associ-
ated disease processes by altering host biological pathways is an
interesting approach for controlling HIV-associated morbidities
and has potential for impacting the brain compartment indepen-
dent of pVL measurements (101). Additionally, the study raises
important questions: Is tissue pathogenesis during HIV infection
entirely independent of pVL? What role does host genetics play in
the susceptibility to syndromes such as HAND? And, to what ex-
tent were the observations in this study due to the weeks or days
before death where potentially extensive measures are undertaken
to preserve life? Furthermore, while extensive research has focused
on the HIV-infected T cell as the primary HIV reservoir, this study
suggests that HIV-infected tissue macrophages are an underex-
plored reservoir during cART.
In summary, after their HIV diagnosis, most participants in
this cohort adhered to their prescribed medications over the
course of their infection, all developed numerous comorbidities
leading to their death, and all were identified as having HIV�
tissues. Tumors and atherosclerosis emerged as major disease pro-
cesses in this cohort. As a final point, the use of well-defined and
documented sources of tissue is likely to advance our knowledge
as to how chronic HIV infection may contribute to the disease
processes that are currently epidemic in patients on current cART.
Our study combines the attributes of a longitudinal observa-
tional study and biobanks with the purpose of supporting diverse,
hypothesis-based research projects. Nonetheless, there are ac-
knowledged limitations to our study. First, we depended upon the
generous voluntary efforts of our human participants and their
caregivers to donate time, data, and tissues. These altruistic indi-
viduals may not represent a random or a representative sample of
all HIV-infected persons. Due to the focus on tissue collection, the
NNAB preferentially selected individuals thought to have serious
life-threatening illnesses, which may skew the degree and types of
pathology reported in the cohort. Most of our participants did not
know the exact date of their HIV infection; we can only measure
the time from their HIV diagnosis (which may occur years after a
participant first develops symptoms). The participants’ ability to
successfully access cART and the cART regimens prescribed are
subject to the recommendations in force at the time they were
diagnosed, as well as the vagaries of the health care system. Many
of the participants described herein suffered traumatic medical,
psychosocial, and economic adversities during their course, so we
were unable to collect a complete set of data at each time point.
Some had incomplete personal medical records. Finally, this sub-
set of the entire NNAB cohort was selected in part because their
tissues were collected within a relatively short postmortem inter-
val. This is not always feasible, as the participant may expire un-
expectedly and at some distance from the study site, there may be
the need for a police report, and their families and loved ones
deserve a chance to say their last farewells before the decedents
remains are removed for dissection. As the vast majority of indi-
viduals expire outside normal working hours, harvesting tissues in
a timely fashion is labor-intensive and costly. An alternative would
be to use an animal model. There are limited models for HIV
encephalitis in mice. There is also a primate model that uses sim-
ian immunodeficiency virus to induce encephalitis; however, the
primates must be sacrificed as soon as they develop AIDS (102),
whereas our participants demonstrate the effects of long-term
survival with HIV infection treated with cART. There are also a
few individuals with HIV who are in generally good health, who
die unexpectedly, and whose tissues are harvested. While these
cases are very valuable, they tend to lack the detailed neuromedical
histories and short PMIs obtained in our cohort, who usually had
given premortem consent to donate.
