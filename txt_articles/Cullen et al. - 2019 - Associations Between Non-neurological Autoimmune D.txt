ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: A relationship between non-neurological autoimmune (NNAI) disorders and psychosis has been
widely reported but not yet subjected to meta-analysis. We conducted the first meta-analysis examining the
association between NNAI disorders and psychosis and investigated the effect of 1) temporality (as determined by
study design), 2) psychiatric diagnosis, and 3) specific autoimmune disorders.
METHODS: Major databases were searched for articles published until April 2018; 31 studies, comprising data for
.25 million individuals, were eligible. Using random-effects models, we examined the overall association between all
NNAI disorders and psychosis; rheumatoid arthritis was examined separately given the well-established negative
association with psychosis. Stratified analyses investigated the effect of temporality, psychiatric diagnosis, and
specific NNAI disorders.
RESULTS: We observed a positive overall association between NNAI disorders and psychosis (odds ratio [OR] =
1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.41) that was consistent across study designs and psychiatric diagnoses;
however, considerable heterogeneity was detected (I2 = 88.08). Patterns varied across individual NNAI disorders;
associations were positive for pernicious anemia (OR = 1.91; 95% CI, 1.29–2.84), pemphigoid (OR = 1.90; 95%
CI, 1.62–2.24), psoriasis (OR = 1.70; 95% CI, 1.51–1.91), celiac disease (OR = 1.53; 95% CI, 1.12–2.10), and
Graves’ disease (OR = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.03–1.72) and negative for ankylosing spondylitis (OR = 0.72; 95% CI,
0.54–0.98) and rheumatoid arthritis (OR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50–0.84).
CONCLUSIONS: While we observed a positive overall association between NNAI disorders and psychosis, this was
not consistent across all NNAI disorders. Specific factors, including distinct inflammatory pathways, genetic in-
fluences, autoantibodies targeting brain proteins, and exposure to corticosteroid treatment, may therefore underlie
this association.

Findings from studies conducted over the past 6 decades
have been used to support the claim that a relationship exists
between non-neurological autoimmune (NNAI) disorders (i.e.,
autoimmune disorders largely affecting peripheral systems)
and psychosis. In the 1950s, it was first observed that rheu-
matoid arthritis was less common among individuals with
psychosis than in the general population (1,2). Conversely,
subsequent studies reported that other NNAI disorders,
including celiac disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),
and autoimmune thyroid disorders, were more prevalent
among individuals with psychosis (3–6). The most convincing
evidence
has
come
from
several
large-scale
population
studies that have demonstrated positive associations between
schizophrenia and a range of autoimmune disorders (7–9).
While there has been increased interest in this topic in light of
evidence of altered immune system function in psychosis
(10–12), the overall association between NNAI disorders and
psychosis has yet to be investigated using meta-analytic
techniques.
Quantifying the degree of association between NNAI dis-
orders and psychosis and the extent to which this varies
across study designs, specific psychiatric diagnosis, and in-
dividual NNAI disorders may help to elucidate the mechanisms
that underlie any relationship and ultimately lead to the iden-
tification of more effective intervention strategies. Disen-
tangling the temporal nature of this relationship is an important
first step to determining whether these disorders simply co-
occur more commonly than expected or whether NNAI disor-
ders in fact increase the risk for psychosis. To this end, we
conducted the first meta-analysis examining the association
between NNAI disorders and psychosis. Only NNAI disorders
were
included
owing
to
the
well-established

 manifestations of neurological autoimmune disorders. In the
primary analysis, we examined effect sizes obtained from all
studies regardless of design or diagnostic outcome; however,
given the well-documented negative association between rheu-
matoid arthritis and psychosis, effect sizes for this disorder were
examined in isolation. Stratified analyses were conducted to
further examine the extent to which 1) temporality (as determined
by study design), 2) specific psychiatric diagnoses (schizophrenia
vs. more broadly defined psychosis vs. nonschizophrenia psy-
chosis), and 3) specific NNAI disorders influenced the magnitude
and consistency of any effect.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Search Strategy
As far as possible, the search strategy was conducted in
accordance with the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in
Epidemiology guidelines (13), as detailed in Supplemental
Table S1. In brief, PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, WorldCat
dissertations and theses, and Global Health databases were
searched for all articles published until April 2018; reference
lists of review articles were manually searched. Search terms
included psychosis or schizophrenia or nonaffective psychosis
or clinical psychotic symptoms combined with autoimmune
disorders or autoimmune diseases or XXX, the last-mentioned
representing 37 individual NNAI disorders (Supplemental
Table S2). Autoimmune disorders included in the search
strategy were selected a priori from the American Autoimmune
and Related Diseases Association (14); all disorders were
cross-checked against known neurological disorders, as listed
by the American Academy of Neurology (15), and only disor-
ders that did not appear here were deemed eligible for inclu-
sion. Full texts of articles were retrieved as necessary, and
study authors were contacted where these were unavailable.
Selection Criteria
Detailed
inclusion
and
exclusion
criteria
are
provided
in
Supplemental Table S3. After a preliminary screen (title and ab-
stract) to exclude studies that clearly did not meet eligibility
criteria, two of the authors (AEC and SH) reviewed the full text of
all potentially eligible studies to determine inclusion. Disagree-
ments were resolved by discussion with all study authors.
Data Extraction
Two researchers (AEC and SH) independently extracted in-
formation on year of publication, psychiatric diagnosis, auto-
immune disorders, country, study design, data source, sample
size, mean or median age of sample, participant sex, matching
factors, and outcome measure (prevalence or incidence). To
examine the effect of temporality, all eligible studies were
categorized as follows: 1) studies examining the comorbidity of
NNAI disorders and psychosis (type A), 2) studies in which the
autoimmune disorder preceded the onset or measurement of
the psychotic disorder (type B), and 3) studies in which the
psychotic disorder preceded the onset or measurement of the
autoimmune disorder (type C).
We included studies providing prevalence or incidence data
on the basis that psychotic and autoimmune disorders are
both rare, thus, odds and risk ratios are likely comparable (16).
To pool data across studies reporting different effect size
measures, we extracted raw data from all eligible studies as
follows: the number of individuals with both psychosis and an
autoimmune disorder (a), the number of individuals with psy-
chosis who did not have an autoimmune disorder (b), the
number of individuals without psychosis who had an autoim-
mune disorder (c), and the number of individuals who had
neither psychosis nor an autoimmune disorder (d). Extracted
data were used to compute odds ratios (ORs) [(a/c)/(b/d)] with
95% confidence intervals (CIs); a continuity correction of 0.5
was applied to cells with zero counts (17). Thus, our pooled
effect sizes represent raw (unadjusted) associations.
Where the stated aim of the study was to examine auto-
immune disorders, and efforts were made by the authors to
distinguish these from similar disorders with other (non-
autoimmune) causes, we extracted data for all disorders
classified as autoimmune by the authors (excepting those with
a neurological basis); this included various forms of anemia
(8,9,18). For studies reporting data for both schizophrenia and
more broadly defined psychosis (where the latter included
schizophrenia), we subtracted schizophrenia cases from the
total number of psychosis cases to obtain mutually exclusive
groups. Where studies examined multiple NNAI disorders and/
or more than one psychiatric outcome, data were extracted for
each NNAI disorder and/or psychiatric outcome separately
such that a single study could provide multiple effect sizes.
Authors were contacted when these data were not reported in
the publication, with data provided for some studies (4,18–22),
but not others (7,23–25).
Eligible studies were assessed for quality by the first author
(AEC) using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale
(26). The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale provides separate assessment
criteria for cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies,
covering
three
methodological
domains
(selection
criteria,
comparability, and measurement of exposure and/or outcome).
Scoring criteria were amended such that the maximum score
available for each study design was 8 (Supplemental Table S4).
Statistical Analyses
Meta-analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta
Analysis Software Version 3.0 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ). Given
that the studies varied with respect to design and specific
autoimmune disorders examined, we anticipated that the true
effect would vary across studies; all analyses were therefore
conducted using a random-effects model with inverse weighting
applied (27). Stratified analyses were used to explore potential
mechanisms and sources of heterogeneity. We first examined
the overall association between NNAI disorders and psychosis,
excluding effect sizes pertaining to rheumatoid arthritis. Next, we
explored the effect of temporality by conducting analyses for
each of the separate study design types defined above (A, B, and
C). In the third step, we stratified by psychiatric diagnosis to
determine whether the association with autoimmune disorders
varied according to whether the outcome was schizophrenia,
more broadly defined psychosis (including schizophrenia), or
nonschizophrenia psychosis. Finally, meta-analyses were con-
ducted for individual autoimmune disorders where more than
three effect sizes were available. Statistical significance was set
at p , .05 (two-tailed) for all analyses. Heterogeneity was

 assessed via the Cochran Q statistic (to identify statistically
significant heterogeneity) and the I2 statistic (to estimate the
percentage of the variability in ORs owing to heterogeneity)
where classification of the latter as likely unimportant (0–40%),
moderate (30%–60%), substantial (50%–90%), or considerable
(75%–100%) was dependent on the magnitude and/or direction
of effects and statistical significance of heterogeneity (28). Given
the problems associated with applying statistical tests to assess
small sample bias (publication bias) in meta-analyses with binary
outcomes, particularly when significant heterogeneity is present
(29), small sample bias was assessed visually by means of a
funnel plot for analyses with 10 or more effect sizes.
RESULTS
Search Results
Thirty publications (4,8,9,18–22,30–51) yielding 31 studies and
107 effect sizes met inclusion criteria (Figure 1). This included
one study originally published as a conference abstract (later
withdrawn as the author was unable to attend) (18), but for
which statistical outputs for all analyses were kindly provided
by the study author. Study details are provided in Table 1; the
total number of individuals included across all studies was
25,041,429. Quality rating scores ranged from 2 to 8 (mean 6
SD: 5.06 6 1.29).
Global Association Between Autoimmune Disorders
and Psychosis
An analysis was first conducted to test the global associa-
tion between all NNAI disorders, excluding rheumatoid
arthritis, and psychosis. As shown in Figure 2, a significant
positive association was observed (OR = 1.26; 95% CI,
1.12–1.41); however, considerable between-study hetero-
geneity
was
detected
(Table
2).
The
funnel
plot
(Supplemental
Figure
S1A)
showed
no
evidence
of
asymmetry.
Stratification by Temporal Relationship
The temporal association between NNAI disorders (excluding
rheumatoid arthritis) and psychosis was investigated by con-
ducting separate meta-analyses for studies examining the
comorbidity of these disorders (type A), studies in which the
autoimmune disorder preceded psychosis (type B), and
studies in which psychosis preceded the autoimmune disorder
(type C). Significant positive associations were observed for all
three study types: A (OR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.06–1.35), B (OR =
1.43; 95% CI, 1.04–1.95), C (OR = 1.55; 95% CI, 1.01–2.38).
However, there was considerable heterogeneity between
studies within each type (Table 2).
Stratification by Psychiatric Outcome
Of the 90 effect sizes included in the main analysis (i.e.,
excluding rheumatoid arthritis), 77 examined schizophrenia, 8
examined a more broadly defined psychosis outcome that
included schizophrenia, and 5 examined nonschizophrenia psy-
chosis. As shown in Table 2, ORs were positive and statistically
significant for all three psychiatric diagnostic outcomes: schizo-
phrenia (OR = 1.21; 95% CI, 1.04–1.40), broadly defined psy-
chosis (OR = 1.81; 95% CI, 1.39–2.37), nonschizophrenia
psychosis (OR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.01–1.88). However, heteroge-
neity was considerable for all three outcomes.
Stratification by Autoimmune Disorder
Separate
meta-analyses
were
conducted
for
individual
autoimmune disorders where more than three effect sizes
were available for analysis (Table 2). A significant positive
association was observed for pernicious anemia (OR = 1.91;
95% CI, 1.29–2.84), pemphigoid (OR = 1.90; 95% CI, 1.62–
2.24), psoriasis (OR = 1.70; 95% CI, 1.51–1.91), celiac dis-
ease (OR = 1.53; 95% CI, 1.12–2.10), and Graves’ disease
(OR = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.03–1.72). Significant negative associ-
ations with psychosis were observed for both ankylosing
spondylitis (OR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54–0.98) and rheumatoid
arthritis (OR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50–0.84) (Figure 3). No sig-
nificant associations with psychosis were observed for alo-
pecia areata, Crohn’s disease, polymyalgia rheumatica, SLE,
type 1 diabetes, or ulcerative colitis. Of the seven autoim-
mune disorders significantly associated with psychosis, het-
erogeneity estimates were possibly unimportant to moderate,
and not statistically significant, for pernicious anaemia,
ankylosing spondylitis, celiac disease, Graves’ disease, and
pemphigoid, whereas significant, moderate to substantial
heterogeneity was detected for psoriasis and rheumatoid
arthritis (Table 2). Visual inspection of the funnel plot for

DISCUSSION
This is the first meta-analysis to examine the association be-
tween multiple NNAI disorders and psychosis. Our primary
analysis (which excluded rheumatoid arthritis) showed evi-
dence of a generic positive association between NNAI disor-
ders and psychosis. While the overall effect size was small
(OR = 1.26), and substantial heterogeneity was detected, this
positive association was consistent across study designs and
psychiatric outcomes. Analyses conducted for separate NNAI
disorders showed significant positive associations for perni-
cious anemia, pemphigoid, psoriasis, celiac disease, and
Graves’ disease and significant negative associations for
ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis.
Stratified analyses demonstrated that not only is there
increased comorbidity between NNAI disorders and psychosis
(type A), but also NNAI disorders increase the risk for subsequent
psychosis (type B) and vice versa (type C). Similarly, the positive
association we observed was consistent across psychiatric di-
agnoses despite the fact that analyses performed in these sub-
groups were likely underpowered. However, heterogeneity was
not improved when we stratified by these variables, which likely
reflects the wide range of NNAI disorders examined. Stratification
by NNAI disorder improved heterogeneity estimates for some
conditions but not others (alopecia areata, Crohn’s disease,
psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, and type 1 diabetes). Study
factors (e.g., country and data source) and participant factors
(sex and treatment) may contribute to the residual heterogeneity
observed within these NNAI disorders.
Our analyses were restricted to studies that provided raw data
that could be used to calculate ORs, thereby precluding us from
including data from two nationwide studies, each examining
multiple NNAI disorders, that specifically addressed temporal
effects (7,23). Benros et al. (7) reported that the presence of any
prior autoimmune disorder increased the risk of schizophrenia by
1.29-fold, whereas schizophrenia increased the risk for subse-
quent autoimmune disorder by 1.53-fold (23). As these results
are consistent with the summary ORs that we derived from type
B (OR = 1.43) and type C (OR = 1.55) studies, it is unlikely that
these data would have altered the significant positive associa-
tions that we observed, although the statistical significance of
our type C analyses (which were likely underpowered) may have
increased.
Multiple factors have been suggested to underlie the
observed association between NNAI disorders and psychosis,
including inflammation, shared genetic vulnerability, predis-
posing infections, and brain-reactive antibodies (10). Several
lines of evidence support the inflammatory hypothesis of
psychosis. First, elevated levels of inflammatory markers (i.e.,
C-reactive protein and cytokines) and proinflammatory cells
(e.g., T helper 17 cells) have been observed among individuals
with schizophrenia (52–57). Second, increased activity of the
complement system has been reported in both schizophrenia
(58) and autoimmune disorders (59). Finally, proinflammatory
cytokines have been associated with smaller hippocampal
volume in patients with first-episode psychosis (60) and shown
to predict progressive thinning of the prefrontal cortex among
individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (i.e., individuals
thought to be in the putatively prodromal phase of illness
based on their clinical presentation), which was in turn asso-
ciated with transition to psychosis (61). Although activation of
the immune system is a core feature of all autoimmune dis-
orders, differences in the downstream molecular immune
pathways activated across the different autoimmune diseases
may partly explain why we observed significant associations
for some, but not all, NNAI disorders in stratified analyses.
That there might be a shared genetic link between autoim-
mune disorders and psychosis is supported by genome-wide
association studies showing that immune regulatory genes
are significantly associated with schizophrenia (62). Of partic-
ular relevance is the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene loci,
which encode molecules involved in antigen presentation,
inflammation, the complement system, and immune responses
(63) and have been associated with schizophrenia in numerous
genome-wide association studies (64). However, two recent
genome-wide association studies failed to show that single
nucleotide polymorphisms associated with autoimmune dis-
orders
(including
ankylosing
spondylitis,
celiac
disease,
Graves’ disease, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis) were
enriched in schizophrenia (65,66). In contrast, recent studies
have
reported
a
significant
negative
single
nucleotide
polymorphism–genetic correlation between schizophrenia and
seropositive cases of rheumatoid arthritis (67) and have iden-
tified single nucleotide polymorphisms with potential pleio-
tropic effects for schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis (i.e.,
where allelic variants of the same gene increase the risk for
different disorders) (68). Thus, shared genes (particularly HLA
genes) might explain the negative associations we observed
between psychosis and rheumatoid arthritis, but not the pos-
itive associations we found with other NNAI disorders or the
negative association with ankylosing spondylitis.
Infectious diseases are thought to play a role in the etiology
of autoimmune disorders (69). A recent study from Denmark
indicated that severe infections resulting in hospitalization
(including bacterial, viral, and other causes of infection) in-
crease the risk for many autoimmune disorders, including
anemia, celiac disease, pemphigoid, psoriasis, and rheumatoid
arthritis (70). Moreover, data from the same population show
that the risk of schizophrenia is even higher among individuals
exposed to both an autoimmune disorder and serious infection
(7). Thus, prior infection could increase the risk for both NNAI
disorders and psychosis. However, evidence regarding the role
of specific pathogens in NNAI disorders is often lacking, and it
is possible that HLA genes [which have been associated with
risk of developing both infections and autoimmune diseases
(63)] might explain these associations. Moreover, infection is
associated with elevated risk of ankylosing spondylitis and
rheumatoid arthritis (70), which in the current study were
negatively associated with psychosis. Thus, infection is un-
likely to fully explain the observed pattern of results.
There is current interest in the role of neuronal surface au-
toantibodies in psychosis (71). These antibodies (most of
which have been characterized only recently) can induce
autoimmune encephalopathies, in which psychotic symptoms
are frequently featured. Antibodies directed against the anti–N-
methyl-D-aspartate receptor are of particular interest given the
links between this receptor and psychosis, with a recent meta-

 analysis finding that these neuronal surface autoantibodies are
more commonly detected among individuals with psychosis
relative to healthy control subjects (72). Given that studies of
neuronal surface autoantibodies are in their infancy, the extent
to which they might explain the association between autoim-
mune disorders and psychosis is unclear, particularly because
no studies to date have examined the prevalence of these
antibodies in individuals with NNAI disorders. However, en-
cephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroid disease
(also known as Hashimoto’s encephalopathy or steroid-
responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thy-
roid disease), a condition associated with neurological and
psychiatric symptoms, has been observed among individuals
with Graves’ disease, all of whom presented with antithyroid
antibodies (73). Moreover, a recent study reported that anti-
thyroid antibodies were present in 13% of patients with
schizophreniform disorder (74). Further research is needed to
determine the extent to which specific autoantibodies might

 mediate the association between the specific NNAI disorders
and psychosis that we observed.
The potential contribution of corticosteroid treatments to the
association between NNAI disorders and psychosis has received
relatively little attention. This is surprising given that there is
robust evidence of glucocorticoid (i.e., cortisol) abnormalities
among individuals with, and at risk for, psychosis (75). Moreover,
a recent population-based study reported increased risks for
schizophrenia spectrum disorders among children and adoles-
cents who received glucocorticoid treatment (76). Of particular
relevance to our findings, corticosteroids are among the most
common types of treatment for psoriasis and pemphigoid
(77–79) and some forms of autoimmune anemia (80). However,
corticosteroids are also commonly used in the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis (81), which was negatively associated with
psychosis. Thus, the contribution of corticosteroids to these
associations is currently unclear.
The negative association we observed between rheumatoid
arthritis and psychosis is consistent with an earlier meta-analysis
(82). Given the late age of onset for rheumatoid arthritis, it
possible that this relationship is partly explained by reduced life
expectancy and poorer health care (leading to lower detection
rates) among people with psychosis. Of note, rates of cancer, a
disease that typically has its onset in later life, are also lower
among individuals with psychosis (83). Consistent with this
explanation, juvenile-onset rheumatoid arthritis was not signifi-
cantly associated with psychosis (Figure 3), although juvenile-
onset and late-onset forms differ with regard to symptom
severity and treatment (84). Moreover, the fact that significant
negative associations were found across type A (8,18,44), B

 (41,47), and C (20) studies is at odds with this hypothesis and
instead suggests that a third factor (e.g., genetic influences or
treatment) may underlie this association.
One novel finding was the significant negative association
observed between ankylosing spondylitis and psychosis. While
this result is perhaps unsurprising given that ankylosing spon-
dylitis was initially thought to be a type of rheumatoid arthritis, the
etiology and presentation of these conditions differ substantially
(85). Specifically, the age of onset is far earlier for ankylosing
spondylitis than for rheumatoid arthritis; the former is more
common in male patients, whereas the reverse is true for rheu-
matoid arthritis; and the disorders are associated with different
HLA genes (86). Further investigation is needed to identify factors
(including other polygenes) common to both disorders that might
explain their negative association with psychosis. As a related
issue, it is interesting to note that we observed positive associ-
ations with NNAI disorders that are traditionally classified as
organ-specific (pernicious anemia, Graves’ disease, pemphi-
goid, and psoriasis) but negative associations with systemic
NNAI disorders (ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis)
that target multiple organs. However, the distinction between
organ-specific and systemic disorders is not clear cut, and cur-
rent categorization is largely based on clinical presentation as
opposed to the expression pattern of the self-antigen (87).
While psychotic symptoms are a common neuropsychiatric
feature of SLE (88), SLE was not significantly associated with
psychosis in this meta-analysis; in fact, only one study meeting
inclusion criteria reported a significant positive association for
SLE and psychosis (48). This may be because psychoses or
psychotic manifestations in SLE can be acute and transient
and therefore not equivalent to a diagnosis of psychotic dis-
order. In addition, the studies that do refer to diagnosed psy-
chotic disorders in SLE are often isolated case reports (89) or
studies that do not include control groups (90), which were not
examined in this meta-analysis.
Strengths and Limitations
The vast quantity of data examined (.25 million individuals) is
a major strength of this study. Our search strategy was con-
ducted to ensure that we captured all relevant studies,
including some very early publications. A further strength re-
lates to the fact that we systematically investigated the effect
of temporality, psychiatric diagnosis, and specific NNAI dis-
orders on the magnitude and consistency of effects.
Some limitations must be noted. First, owing to substantial
variation in the effect size measures reported across studies,
we extracted raw data to compute ORs. This meant that our
effect sizes were not adjusted for important confounding fac-
tors that may have influenced the association. However, half of
the included studies matched cases and controls on age and
sex (Table 1). Second, as we were keen to use all available
data, we included studies using both small clinical samples
and large nationwide populations, which may have contributed
to heterogeneity. Third, as this study was undertaken for partial
fulfillment of a Master’s thesis (SH), a protocol was not pub-
lished before undertaking the study, and as such our analysis
strategy may have been driven by the data. Fourth, by
extracting (and pooling) data for individual NNAI disorders,
patients with more than one NNAI disorder may have been
counted twice in the primary (overall) analysis. Fifth, we
examined a wide range of disorders classified as autoimmune
in the primary articles that included some diseases for which
an autoimmune basis has not yet been demonstrated. How-
ever, to increase validity, we included only NNAI disorders
listed as such by the American Autoimmune and Related
Diseases Association. Finally, despite efforts to obtain data
from study authors for all eligible studies, we were unable to
include data from two large, nationwide studies (7,23). How-
ever, as noted above, it is unlikely that including these data
would have substantially altered the overall finding.
Implications
The finding that psychosis is associated with NNAI disorders
(i.e., autoimmune disorders that would not be expected to
directly target the brain but nonetheless generate substantial
immune system activation in the peripheral systems that might
ultimately affect the brain) is particularly important. However,
given the range of possible mechanisms that may underlie the
significant associations that we observed, the considerable
heterogeneity across studies, and the fact that all effect sizes
were small, treatment recommendations based on these findings
would be premature. Regardless of the mechanism, these find-
ings suggest that careful monitoring of individuals with specific
autoimmune diseases (particularly anemia, Graves’ disease, and
pemphigoid, as these were the most consistent effects) for early
signs of psychosis is warranted.
With regard to future research, we recommend the following: 1)
studies should be designed to better disentangle the temporal
nature of the association between NNAI disorders and psychosis,
as such studies have demonstrated that both psychosis (7,23) and
depression (91) show bidirectional associations with autoimmune
disorders; 2) larger studies should be undertaken to examine the
presence of neuronal surface autoantibodies among individuals
with psychosis; 3) greater efforts should be made in large cohort
studies to include information on potential confounders, such as
socioeconomic status, adversity, and tobacco use; and 4) studies
should be undertaken to evaluate the effect of corticosteroid
treatment on the relationship between NNAI disorders and
psychosis.
