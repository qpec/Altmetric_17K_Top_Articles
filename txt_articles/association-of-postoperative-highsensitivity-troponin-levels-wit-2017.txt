Association of Postoperative High-Sensitivity Troponin Levels
With Myocardial Injury and 30-Day Mortality Among Patients
Undergoing Noncardiac Surgery
Writing Committee for the VISION Study Investigators
IMPORTANCE Little is known about the relationship between perioperative high-sensitivity
troponin T (hsTnT) measurements and 30-day mortality and myocardial injury after
noncardiac surgery (MINS).
OBJECTIVE To determine the association between perioperative hsTnT measurements
and 30-day mortality and potential diagnostic criteria for MINS (ie, myocardial injury due
to ischemia associated with 30-day mortality).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective cohort study of patients aged 45 years
or older who underwent inpatient noncardiac surgery and had a postoperative hsTnT
measurement. Starting in October 2008, participants were recruited at 23 centers
in 13 countries; follow-up finished in December 2013.
EXPOSURES Patients had hsTnT measurements 6 to 12 hours after surgery and daily
for 3 days; 40.4% had a preoperative hsTnT measurement.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A modified Mazumdar approach (an iterative process) was
used to determine if there were hsTnT thresholds associated with risk of death and had
an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 3.0 or higher and a risk of 30-day mortality of 3% or higher.
To determine potential diagnostic criteria for MINS, regression analyses ascertained
if postoperative hsTnT elevations required an ischemic feature (eg, ischemic symptom
or electrocardiography finding) to be associated with 30-day mortality.
RESULTS Among 21 842 participants, the mean age was 63.1 (SD, 10.7) years and 49.1% were
female. Death within 30 days after surgery occurred in 266 patients (1.2%; 95% CI,
1.1%-1.4%). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that compared with the reference group
(peak hsTnT <5 ng/L), peak postoperative hsTnT levels of 20 to less than 65 ng/L, 65 to less
than 1000 ng/L, and 1000 ng/L or higher had 30-day mortality rates of 3.0% (123/4049;
95% CI, 2.6%-3.6%), 9.1% (102/1118; 95% CI, 7.6%-11.0%), and 29.6% (16/54; 95% CI,
19.1%-42.8%), with corresponding adjusted HRs of 23.63 (95% CI, 10.32-54.09), 70.34 (95%
CI, 30.60-161.71), and 227.01 (95% CI, 87.35-589.92), respectively. An absolute hsTnT change
of 5 ng/L or higher was associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality (adjusted HR,
4.69; 95% CI, 3.52-6.25). An elevated postoperative hsTnT (ie, 20 to <65 ng/L with an
absolute change �5 ng/L or hsTnT �65 ng/L) without an ischemic feature was associated
with 30-day mortality (adjusted HR, 3.20; 95% CI, 2.37-4.32). Among the 3904 patients
(17.9%; 95% CI, 17.4%-18.4%) with MINS, 3633 (93.1%; 95% CI, 92.2%-93.8%) did not
experience an ischemic symptom.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, peak
postoperative hsTnT during the first 3 days after surgery was significantly associated with
30-day mortality. Elevated postoperative hsTnT without an ischemic feature was also
associated with 30-day mortality.

L
arge observational studies suggest that among patients
aged 45 years or older undergoing major noncardiac sur-
gery, more than 1% die in hospital or within 30 days of
surgery.1,2 Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS)
is defined as myocardial injury caused by ischemia that oc-
curs during or within 30 days after surgery and is indepen-
dently associated with mortality.3 Diagnostic criteria for MINS,
based on the non–high-sensitivity troponin T assay, have been
identified3; however, the US Food and Drug Administration re-
cently approved use of the high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT)
assay, and globally, many hospitals are using high-sensitivity
troponin assays.
Little is known about the relationship between peri-
operative hsTnT measurements and 30-day mortality.
A large international study, the Vascular Events in Noncar-
diac Surgery Patients Cohort Evaluation (VISION) Study, was
undertaken to assess perioperative complications. Among
adults who underwent noncardiac surgery and had a postop-
erative hsTnT measurement, the primary objective was to
determine the association between perioperative hsTnT
measurements and 30-day mortality and potential diag-
nostic criteria for MINS based on hsTnT. The secondary
objectives were to (1) determine if there was an interaction
between the lowest prognostically important postoperative
hsTnT threshold (ie, the lowest hsTnT threshold that was
independently associated with patients’risk of 30-day mor-
tality and had an adjusted hazard ratio [HR] ≥3.0 and a risk
of 30-day mortality ≥3%) and estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) or sex; (2) describe the characteristics of patients
experiencing MINS and their outcomes; and (3) determine
the proportion of MINS that might go undetected without
troponin monitoring.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
The VISION Study was a prospective cohort study of a repre-
sentative sample of adults who underwent noncardiac sur-
gery.Inthefirst15 000patients,non-hsTnTwasmeasuredand
its association with 30-day mortality and MINS was evalu-
ated and reported.2,3 In the second half of the study, hsTnT
measurements were obtained in more than 21 000 patients.
This represents the focus of this article.

Procedures
Details regarding participant screening and procedures to en-
sure a representative sample are reported in eAppendix 2 in
the Supplement. Research personnel interviewed and exam-
ined patients and reviewed charts to obtain data on variables
potentially associated with perioperative complications. Pa-
tients had blood collected for measurement by the Roche fifth-
generation Elecsys hsTnT assay 6 to 12 hours postoperatively
and on days 1, 2, and 3 after surgery. Patients enrolled be-
tween12and24hoursaftersurgeryhadblooddrawnforhsTnT
measurement immediately, and testing continued as de-
scribed above. During the later phase of the study, hsTnT mea-
surement was added before surgery. The majority of hospi-
tals analyzed the hsTnT measurements of their patients and
reported the results to clinicians. Two UK centers blinded cli-
nicianstohsTnTresults.IntheUnitedStates,wherehsTnTwas
not approved for clinical use at the time of conducting the
VISION Study, blood samples were collected, processed, fro-
zen, and analyzed for hsTnT at a later date. For US partici-
pants, the fourth-generation non-hsTnT assay was used and
clinicians received these results; however, analyses for this
study are restricted to the hsTnT measurements.
Throughouthospitalstay,researchpersonnelevaluatedpa-
tients, reviewed hospital charts, ensured that patients had
hsTnT measurements completed, and noted outcomes (eAp-
pendix 3 in the Supplement). Patients with an hsTnT level of
at least 14 ng/L (ie, threshold considered abnormal by
manufacturer)4 were assessed for ischemic features (eg, is-
chemicsymptoms,ischemicelectrocardiographicfindings;de-
fined in eAppendix 4 in the Supplement). Centers were en-
couraged to obtain electrocardiograms for several days after
an hsTnT measurement result of at least 14 ng/L and to ob-
tain hsTnT measurements and electrocardiograms if patients
experienced an ischemic symptom. Exceptions to these pro-
cedures occurred in the 2 centers that blinded clinicians to the
hsTnT results and among US participants with an hsTnT level
ofatleast14ng/Lbutanon-hsTnTleveloflessthan0.04ng/mL
(ie,thresholdconsideredabnormalbymanufacturer).Forthese
Key Points
Question What is the relationship between perioperative
high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) measurements and 30-day
mortality and myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery?
Findings In this prospective cohort study of 21 842 patients,
elevated postoperative hsTnT measured 6 to 12 hours after
surgery and daily for 3 days with and without an ischemic feature
(eg, ischemic symptom, ischemic electrocardiography finding)
was significantly associated with an increased risk of 30-day
mortality (0.5% for <20 ng/L, 3.0% for 20 to <65 ng/L, 9.1%
for 65 to <1000 ng/L, and 29.6% for �1000 ng/L).
Meaning Among patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, peak
postoperative hsTnT was significantly associated with 30-day
mortality, even in the absence of an ischemic feature.

patients, study personnel reviewed clinical notes for ische-
mic symptoms, but no electrocardiograms were obtained.
Study personnel telephoned patients at 30 days after sur-
gery; documentation was obtained if patients (or next of kin)
indicated that they had experienced an outcome. At each site,
an investigator reviewed and approved all data. Research per-
sonnel submitted the case report forms and supporting docu-
mentation to the data management system (iDataFax, coor-
dinating center, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada). Data
monitoring in VISION consisted of central data consistency
checks and on-site monitoring.
Expert unblinded physician adjudicators evaluated all pa-
tients with an elevated hsTnT level. They assessed the clini-
cal notes and laboratory data related to elevated hsTnT mea-
surements to determine the presence of an ischemic feature
(ie, whether a patient fulfilled the universal definition of myo-
cardial infarction),5 for evidence that the hsTnT elevation was
due to a nonischemic etiology (eg, sepsis, pulmonary em-
bolus, atrial fibrillation, cardioversion, chronic elevation), and
to confirm that the myocardial injury had occurred during or
after surgery rather than before surgery. Their decisions were
used in the statistical analyses.
Statistical Analyses
A statistical analysis plan was written before undertaking the
analyses. For the analyses to determine the association be-
tween perioperative hsTnT measurements and 30-day mor-
tality, patients were excluded if they did not have an hsTnT
measurement during the first 3 days after surgery, if the
hospital laboratory reported their hsTnT as less than 10 ng/L
or less than 14 ng/L instead of an absolute value, or if they were
missingdataonabaselineclinicalvariableincludedinthemul-
tivariable model. A Cox proportional hazards model was un-
dertaken in which the dependent variable was mortality up to
30 days after surgery and the independent variables included
preoperative and surgical variables previously associated with
30-day mortality (eAppendix 5 in the Supplement)2 and peak
postoperative hsTnT thresholds from the first 3 days after sur-
gery (ie, 0 to 100 ng/L in increments of 5 ng/L [except that
14 ng/L was used instead of 15 ng/L because 14 ng/L repre-
sents the 99th percentile], 100 to 200 ng/L in increments of
10 ng/L, and 200 to 1000 ng/L in increments of 100 ng/L).
AmodifiedMazumdarapproach(ie,aniterativeprocessthat
explored potential hsTnT thresholds)2,6 was used to deter-
mineiftherewereprognosticallyimportantpostoperativehsTnT
thresholds that were independently associated with patients’
risk of 30-day mortality and had an adjusted HR of at least 3.0
and a risk of 30-day mortality of at least 3% (these require-
ments were determined a priori based on feedback from inter-
national perioperative researchers and an anticipated 1%
30-day mortality rate in the overall cohort). Through this itera-
tive process, prognostically important hsTnT thresholds were
identified until the P value from the likelihood ratio test was
greater than .01 or the hsTnT threshold had an adjusted HR of
lessthan3.Afterestablishingtheprognosticallyimportantpeak
postoperativehsTnTthresholds,aKaplan-Meiercurvewascon-
structed. The modified Mazumdar approach was also used to
determine if there were absolute changes between preopera-
tive and postoperative hsTnT values that were independently
associated with 30-day mortality. Using the lowest significant
change threshold identified in this analysis, subsequent analy-
ses evaluated the association between the highest and lowest
perioperative hsTnT measurements (eg, change between post-
operative hsTnT measurements) and 30-day mortality.
To determine if there was a significant interaction
(ie, interaction P < .05) between the lowest prognostically
important postoperative hsTnT threshold and eGFR or sex,
the Cox model was repeated that included the lowest prog-
nostically important postoperative hsTnT threshold and
preoperative eGFR (ie, <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or undergoing di-
alysis, 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m2, 45-59 mL/min/1.73 m2, and
≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and the interaction between the hsTnT
threshold and eGFR. The model was repeated substituting sex
for eGFR.
For the analyses to determine potential diagnostic crite-
ria for MINS, patients with the following were excluded: no
hsTnT measurement during the first 30 days after surgery; a
peak hsTnT level of at least 20 ng/L adjudicated as resulting
from a nonischemic etiology (eg, chronic elevation) other than
a nonischemic postoperative complication (eg, sepsis, pulmo-
nary embolus, atrial fibrillation); a peak preoperative hsTnT
levelofatleast20ng/Landthepreoperativemeasurementwas
thepeakmeasurementorequaltothepeakpostoperativemea-
surement;apeakpostoperativehsTnTof20tolessthan65ng/L
and no ability to assess change (ie, only 1 hsTnT measure-
ment); or missing data on a baseline clinical variable or peri-
operative outcome included in the multivariable model.
ToevaluatepotentialdiagnosticcriteriaforMINS,basedon
hsTnT measurements, Cox proportional hazards models were
undertaken in which the dependent variable was 30-day mor-
tality. Independent variables included preoperative and surgi-
cal variables (eAppendix 5 in the Supplement),2 postoperative
outcomes (ie, major bleeding, sepsis, new clinically important
atrial fibrillation, stroke, pulmonary embolus, deep venous
thrombosis,andpneumoniaastime-dependentcovariates),and
potential MINS diagnostic criteria (ie, an elevated postopera-
tive hsTnT measurement with an ischemic feature and an
elevated postoperative hsTnT measurement without an ische-
mic feature). If the elevated postoperative hsTnT measure-
ment with and without ischemic features was significantly as-
sociated with 30-day mortality, the MINS diagnostic criteria
wouldrequireonlyanelevatedhsTnT,withouttheneedforpres-
ence of an ischemic feature. Patients with an elevated postop-
erative hsTnT measurement that adjudicators attributed to
a nonischemic postoperative complication (eg, sepsis) were
included in these analyses but were not counted as having an
elevated postoperative hsTnT measurement due to ischemia.
For the Cox model in which the dependent variable was
30-day mortality and the independent variables included pre-
operative and surgical variables and postoperative complica-
tions (eg, MINS, major bleeding) as time-dependent covari-
ates, several sensitivity analyses and analyses to assess for
interactionswereundertaken.Thefirstsensitivityanalysiswas

peak preoperative hsTnT level of at least 20 ng/L, in whom the
preoperativemeasurementwasthepeakmeasurementorequal
to the peak postoperative measurement, and all of these pa-
tients were counted as non-MINS patients. For the third sen-
sitivity analysis, the second sensitivity analysis was re-
peated, but patients with a peak preoperative hsTnT level of
at least 20 ng/L and in whom the preoperative measurement
was the peak measurement or equal to the peak postopera-
tivemeasurementwerecountedashavinghadMINS.Ananaly-
sis was undertaken based on the 2 sites that blinded clini-
cianstohsTnTresultsandaseparateanalysisbasedonallother
sites and tested for an interaction between MINS diagnostic
criteria and these groups of centers. To determine if there was
an interaction between MINS and the presence of a preopera-
tive hsTnT measurement, the Cox model was repeated and in-
corporated a test of interaction between MINS and the pres-
ence of a preoperative hsTnT measurement.
AfteridentifyingtheMINSdiagnosticcriteriaforthisstudy,
the proportion of patients experiencing MINS with ischemic
featureswasdetermined(eAppendix4intheSupplement).The
proportion of MINS that might have gone undetected with-
out troponin monitoring (ie, MINS without an ischemic symp-
tom) was also determined.
Random-effects (frailty) Cox models to adjust for poten-
tial site-clustering effects were undertaken.7 The adjusted HRs
and 95% confidence intervals were reported, and discrimina-
tion was assessed through evaluation of the C statistic. All tests
were 2-sided and a P < .05 was designated as statistically sig-
nificant; however, the likelihood ratio test required a P ≤ .01.
Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Insti-
tute Inc) and R version 3.3.2 (R Project).
Results
Patients were recruited at 23 centers in 13 countries in North
America, South America, Africa, Asia, Australia, and Europe
from October 2008 to November 2013 (eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment). Of the 21 842 patients included in these analyses (mean
age, 63.1 [SD, 10.7] years; 49.1% female), 21 050 (96.4%) com-
pleted the 30-day follow-up; the remaining patients were cen-
sored at the time of hospital discharge. The Figure shows par-
ticipant study flow.
Table 1 reports patients’preoperative characteristics and
the surgery performed (for definitions, see eAppendix 6 in the
Supplement);approximatelyhalfwerewomen.Themostcom-
mon types of surgery were major orthopedic (16.5%), major
general (20.2%), and low-risk (35.5%). The median number of
hsTnT measurements after surgery was 3 (interquartile range,
2-4), and 40.4% had a preoperative hsTnT measurement.
eTable 2 in the Supplement reports the timing of preopera-
tive hsTnT measurements. eTable 3 in the Supplement re-
ports the baseline characteristics of patients who did and did
not have a preoperative hsTnT measurement.
Death within 30 days after surgery occurred in 266 pa-
tients (1.2%; 95% CI, 1.1%-1.4%). Multivariable analyses dem-
onstratedthatcomparedwiththereferencegroup(peakhsTnT
level <5 ng/L), peak postoperative hsTnT levels of 20 to less
than 65 ng/L, 65 to less than 1000 ng/L, and 1000 ng/L or more
had adjusted HRs of 23.63 (95% CI, 10.32-54.09), 70.34 (95%
CI, 30.60-161.71), and 227.01 (95% CI, 87.35-589.92), with cor-
responding 30-day mortality rates of 3.0%, 9.1%, and 29.6%,
respectively (Table 2). The random-effects Cox model that ad-
justed for any potential site-clustering effect produced simi-
lar results (eTable 4 in the Supplement). The eFigure in the
Supplement presents the Kaplan-Meier estimates for 30-day
mortality based on the peak postoperative hsTnT thresholds
identified through the modified Mazumdar approach.
Cox models demonstrated no interaction between the lowest
prognostically important postoperative hsTnT threshold
(ie, ≥20 ng/L) and eGFR or sex (interaction P=.83 and P=.20,
respectively).AsensitivityanalysisthatassessedeGFRasacon-
tinuous variable demonstrated an interaction P = .89.
The modified Mazumdar approach identified that abso-
lute changes of at least 5 ng/L and at least 40 ng/L between pre-
operative and postoperative hsTnT measurements were inde-
pendentlyassociatedwithriskof30-daymortality(Table3).The
lower change value (≥5 ng/L) across any hsTnT measurements
was associated with risk of 30-day mortality (30-day mortality
ratesinpatientswithchangesof<5ng/Land≥5ng/Lwere0.5%
and 3.0%, respectively; adjusted HR, 4.69; 95% CI, 3.52-6.25).
Few patients who had an hsTnT level of at least 65 ng/L did not
have a change of at least 5 ng/L, and these patients had a high
risk of death (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Analyses restricted
to patients with a peak postoperative hsTnT level of less than
65 ng/L demonstrated that an absolute change of at least 5 ng/L
was associated with 30-day mortality (adjusted HR, 3.28; 95%
CI, 2.38-4.53) (eTable 6 in the Supplement).
Based on these results, an elevated postoperative hsTnT
measurement was defined as 20 to less than 65 ng/L with an
absolute change of at least 5 ng/L or an hsTnT level of at least
65 ng/L. Among the 4385 patients (19.7%) with an elevated
postoperative hsTnT level, 481 (11.0%; 95% CI, 10.1%-11.9%)
were adjudicated as having nonischemic, non-MINS hsTnT
elevations (eg, sepsis) (eTable 7 in the Supplement). Among
the 9494 patients with a preoperative hsTnT measurement,
2355 patients (24.8%) had an elevated perioperative hsTnT,
of whom 326 (13.8%; 95% CI, 12.5%-15.3%) had a preopera-
tive hsTnT that was greater than or equal to the peak postop-
erative hsTnT measurement.
eTable 8 in the Supplement reports the 30-day mortality
rates among patients who did not have MINS (0.6%), who had
MINS without an ischemic feature (2.9%), and who had MINS
with an ischemic feature (8.5%). The results of the Cox pro-
portional hazards model demonstrated that an elevated post-
operative hsTnT level without an ischemic feature (adjusted
HR, 3.20; 95%, CI, 2.37-4.32) and with an ischemic feature
(adjusted HR, 5.04; 95% CI, 3.56-7.12) were independently
associated with 30-day mortality. Based on this analysis, the
diagnostic criteria for MINS were an elevated postoperative
hsTnT level judged as resulting from myocardial ischemia
(ie, no evidence of nonischemic etiology for the hsTnT eleva-
tion) without the requirement of an ischemic feature.

which demonstrated similar findings to the results in eTable
8. The second sensitivity analysis (ie, the Cox model that in-
cluded and designated as non-MINS patients all those who had
a peak hsTnT level ≥20 ng/L adjudicated as resulting from a
nonischemic etiology and those with a peak preoperative
hsTnT level ≥20 ng/L, with the preoperative measurement as
thepeakmeasurementorequaltothepeakpostoperativemea-
surement) demonstrated that MINS was independently asso-
ciated with 30-day mortality (adjusted HR, 3.10; 95% CI, 2.39-
4.02). The third sensitivity analysis (ie, the analysis that
repeated the second sensitivity analysis but designated pa-
tients with a peak preoperative hsTnT level ≥20 ng/L, with the
preoperative measurement as the peak measurement or equal
to the peak postoperative measurement, as MINS patients)
demonstrated that MINS was associated with 30-day mortal-
ity (adjusted HR, 3.34; 95% CI, 2.57-4.34). Cox models dem-
onstrated that there was no interaction between the MINS di-
agnostic criteria and the centers that blinded the hsTnT results
vs the centers that did not blind the hsTnT results (interac-
tion P = .67) or between MINS and the presence vs absence of
a preoperative hsTnT measurement (interaction P = .24).
A total of 3904 patients (17.9%; 95% CI, 17.4%-18.4%) ful-
filled the MINS diagnostic criteria. Table 4 reports the vari-
ables independently associated with 30-day mortality in the
model that included preoperative variables and periopera-
tive complications, including MINS (C statistic, 0.89; 95% CI,
0.87-0.91). Five perioperative complications (ie, MINS, major
bleeding, sepsis, new atrial fibrillation, and stroke) were in-
dependently associated with 30-day mortality. eTable 10 in the
Supplement reports when MINS was diagnosed; 94.1% of di-
agnoses occurred by day 2 after surgery.
Among 3904 patients who had MINS, 846 (21.7%; 95% CI,
20.4%-23.0%) fulfilled the universal definition of myocardial
infarction (ie, an elevated hsTnT with ≥1 ischemic feature),5
of whom 575 (68.0%; 95% CI, 64.7%-71.0%) did not experi-
ence an ischemic symptom. These asymptomatic patients who

fulfilled the universal definition of myocardial infarction had
anotherischemicfeature,mostcommonlyanischemicelectro-
cardiography finding. eTable 11 in the Supplement reports the
ischemic features of patients experiencing MINS; 3.6% expe-
rienced chest discomfort. A total of 3633 patients (93.1%) who
had MINS did not experience an ischemic symptom, and MINS
might have gone undetected without troponin monitoring.
eTable 12 in the Supplement reports cardiovascular out-
comes among patients who had MINS, did not have MINS, and
had MINS and a postoperative hsTnT level of at least 65 ng/L.
All cardiovascular complications were increased among pa-
tients who had MINS, including a composite of nonfatal car-
diac arrest, congestive heart failure, coronary revasculariza-
tion, and mortality (30-day risk among patients who did not
and did have MINS was 0.9% and 7.3%, respectively; unad-
justed odds ratio, 8.47; 95% CI, 6.94-10.34).
Discussion
ApostoperativehsTnTmeasurementofatleast20ng/Lwasas-
sociated with 30-day mortality, and there was no interaction
based on eGFR or sex. An absolute hsTnT change of at least
5ng/LacrossanyhsTnTmeasurementswasalsoassociatedwith
an increased risk of 30-day mortality. Only 11.0% of elevated
postoperative hsTnT measurements (ie, an hsTnT level of 20
to <65 ng/L with an absolute change ≥5 ng/L or an hsTnT level
≥65 ng/L) were adjudicated as having a nonischemic etiology.
Based on the study analyses, the MINS diagnostic criteria were
anelevatedpostoperativehsTnT,judgedasresultingfrommyo-
cardialischemia(ie,noevidenceofanonischemicetiology)not
requiring an ischemic feature. MINS was associated with an in-
creased risk of major cardiovascular complications.
A study of 599 patients who had noncardiac surgery dem-
onstrated in an unadjusted analysis that a peak postoperative
hsTnT level of at least 14 ng/L was associated with an in-
creased risk of 3-year mortality (HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.19-3.15).8
In contrast, the current study identified through adjusted
analyses multiple hsTnT thresholds that were associated with
30-day mortality. In another study of 455 vascular surgery pa-
tients who had preoperative and postoperative hsTnT mea-
surements, an absolute hsTnT change of at least 6.3 ng/L in-
dependently improved risk estimation of a composite of
myocardialinfarctionandcardiovasculardeathat30dayscom-
pared with the revised cardiac risk index alone (P = .002).9 The
current study had substantially more patients and events and
found that an absolute change of at least 5 ng/L was associ-
ated with 30-day mortality.
Although troponin thresholds associated with mortality
and diagnostic criteria for MINS have been identified in prior
studies, these studies were restricted to the non-hsTnT
assay.2,3 Given the recent US Food and Drug Administration
approval of hsTnT and the common use of this assay globally,
the current study provides important information regarding
the hsTnT thresholds associated with 30-day mortality and
diagnostic criteria for MINS. Moreover, the current study pro-
vides data supporting that MINS does not require the pres-
ence of an ischemic feature.
Although anesthetic and surgical advances have im-
proved surgical safety, more than 1% of patients aged 45 years
or older undergoing major noncardiac surgery die in the hos-
pital or within 30 days of surgery.1,2 The current study has

periencing MINS do not receive secondary-prevention cardio-
vasculardrugs(eg,aspirin,statins),10observationalstudiessug-
gestthatthesemedicationspreventmortalityandmajorcardiac

Given that the current study is the second large study re-
porting that the diagnostic criteria for MINS do not require an
ischemicfeature,thisfindingsupportstheMINSdiagnosticcri-
teria of an elevated postoperative hsTnT judged as resulting
from myocardial ischemia (ie, no evidence of a nonischemic
etiology for hsTnT elevation) without the requirement of an
ischemic feature. Without perioperative troponin monitor-
ing, 93.1% of MINS and 68.0% of myocardial infarctions might
go unrecognized because these patients do not experience is-
chemic symptoms. Most patients (94%) experience MINS
within 2 days of surgery, a period when analgesic medica-
tions can mask cardiac symptoms. Given the relevance of ab-
solutechangeinhsTnTmeasurementsindiagnosingMINSand
that 13.8% of patients with an elevated perioperative hsTnT
had their peak value before surgery, physicians should con-
sider obtaining a preoperative hsTnT measurement in pa-
tients in whom they plan to measure hsTnT after surgery.
Strengths of this study include a large, international, rep-
resentative sample of adults undergoing noncardiac surgery;
96.4% of the participants completed 30-day follow-up. All
elevated hsTnT measurements were adjudicated to determine
thepresenceofischemicfeaturesandforevidenceofanonisch-
emic etiology.
This study has several limitations, including the arbitrari-
ness of the criteria for a prognostically important hsTnT el-
evation(ie,adjustedHR≥3.0and30-dayriskofmortality≥3%).
This decision was made a priori based on feedback from many
international investigators. Mortality data based on indepen-
denthsTnTthresholdsthatdidnotfulfillthisdefinitionofprog-
nostic importance were reported (Table 2).
The adjusted HRs’95% confidence intervals were wide for
the peak postoperative hsTnT thresholds that were indepen-
dently associated with 30-day mortality; however, even for the
lowest threshold (ie, an hsTnT of 20 to <65 ng/L), the lower
limit of the 95% confidence interval of the adjusted HR was
10.32. Although this large international study identified hsTnT
thresholds that were associated with 30-day mortality in ad-
justed analyses, and the frailty model demonstrated no site-
clustering effect, further research evaluating the identified
thresholds would be of value.
ObtainmentofpreoperativehsTnTmeasurementswasimple-
mented after the study had started, and only 40.4% of patients
had a preoperative measurement. Given that 13.8% of patients
with an elevated perioperative hsTnT measurement had a pre-
operativehsTnTvaluethatwasgreaterthanorequaltothepost-
operative hsTnT peak measurement, there may have been an
overestimationoftheincidenceofMINSamongthe59.6%ofpa-
tients who did not have a preoperative hsTnT measurement.

Some elevated postoperative hsTnT measurements were
due to nonischemic etiologies; independent adjudicators were
relied on to identify such situations. They likely missed some
ofthese,leadingtoanoverestimationoftheincidenceofMINS.
However, given that adjudicators had access to all of the pa-
tients’clinical notes and laboratory data, they had the oppor-
tunity to identify most nonischemic etiologies. Moreover, the
most common nonischemic etiology was chronic hsTnT el-
evation, and 79.6% of patients with this had a change of at least
5 ng/L. Although adjudicators made their decisions before
analyses established that an absolute hsTnT change of at least
5 ng/L was independently associated with a patient’
s risk of
30-daymortality,theadjudicators’decisionswereacceptedand
thesecasesweretreatedasnonischemichsTnTelevations.This
may have led to an underestimation of the incidence of MINS.
Conclusions
Among patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, peak post-
operative hsTnT during the first 3 days after surgery was sig-
nificantly associated with 30-day mortality. Elevated postop-
erative hsTnT without an ischemic feature was also associated
with 30-day mortality.

a For these analyses to determine
potential diagnostic criteria for
MINS, we excluded patients with no
hsTnT measurement during the first
30 days after surgery, with a peak
hsTnT level �20 ng/L adjudicated
as resulting from a nonischemic
etiology (eg, chronic elevation)
other than a nonischemic
postoperative complication
(eg, sepsis, pulmonary embolus,
atrial fibrillation), with a peak
preoperative hsTnT level �20 ng/L
and the preoperative measurement
was the peak measurement or equal
to the peak postoperative
measurement; a peak postoperative
hsTnT level of 20 to <65 ng/L and
no ability to access change (ie, only 1
hsTnT measurement), or with
missing data on a baseline clinical
variable or perioperative outcome
included in the multivariable model.
The preoperative hsTnT
measurements were obtained on
the day of surgery before the
operation started up to 28 days
before surgery (eTable 2 in the
Supplement), and postoperative
hsTnT measurements during the
first 30 days after surgery were
assessed in these analyses. All of the
perioperative complications and
preoperative variables listed in the
table were included in the model.
