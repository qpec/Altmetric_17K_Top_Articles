Mitochondrial health is critical for skeletal muscle function and is improved by exercise
training through both mitochondrial biogenesis and removal of damaged/dysfunctional
mitochondria via mitophagy. The mechanisms underlying exercise-induced mitophagy
have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that acute treadmill running in mice causes
mitochondrial oxidative stress at 3–12 h and mitophagy at 6 h post-exercise in skeletal
muscle. These changes were monitored using a novel fluorescent reporter gene, pMitoTimer,
that allows assessment of mitochondrial oxidative stress and mitophagy in vivo, and were
preceded by increased phosphorylation of AMP activated protein kinase (Ampk) at tyrosine
172 and of unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (Ulk1) at serine 555. Using mice
expressing dominant negative and constitutively active Ampk in skeletal muscle, we
demonstrate that Ulk1 activation is dependent on Ampk. Furthermore, exercise-induced
metabolic adaptation requires Ulk1. These findings provide direct evidence of exercise-
induced mitophagy and demonstrate the importance of Ampk-Ulk1 signaling in skeletal
muscle.

t has been known since antiquity that exercise training
improves physical performance and health. It was not until
50 years ago that the scientific community started to under-
stand the importance of skeletal muscle biochemical and
cellular adaptations in response to exercise1, 2. Skeletal muscle
protein turnover (i.e., the culmination of protein synthesis and
breakdown processes), particularly of mitochondrial proteins,
plays a central role in mediating the health benefits of exercise
training3–6 (Drake et al., 2015). The role of exercise training
and the mechanisms controlling the synthesis of new mito-
chondria (i.e., mitochondrial biogenesis) have been extensively
studied3, 7, 8, however, our understanding of how exercise
promotes the removal of damaged and dysfunctional mitochon-
dria is still in its infancy9.
Autophagy is a catabolic process that involves the sequestration
of long-lived or damaged proteins and cytoplasmic organelles by
a double-membrane structure called autophagosome10. During
autophagy, an autophagosome then fuses with a lysosome to
execute the degradation of the engulfed contents11. A low degree,
basal level of autophagy appears to be responsible for maintaining
cellular homeostasis and normal cell function12. Autophagy can,
however, be upregulated under conditions of stress, such as in
response to starvation and exercise13, 14. While it is generally
believed that autophagy plays an important role in remodeling of
skeletal muscle in response to exercise7, 14–16, the underlying
molecular and signaling mechanisms remain obscure.
Four previous studies in mouse skeletal muscle showed that
a single bout of exercise increased levels of the microtubule
associated protein, light chain 3-II (Lc3-II; the phosphatidy-
lethanolamine conjugated form of Lc3-I), a marker for autop-
hagosome assembly. Altogether with decreased p62 content, a
cargo receptor for ubiquitinated substrates that is also degraded
during autophagy14, 17–19, it is suggestive of increased autophagy
flux20
following
exercise.
Recently,
we16
and
others21
demonstrated that the autophagy machinery and markers for
autophagy flux are also increased following endurance exercise
training, suggesting increased basal autophagy flux and autop-
hagy capacity. Of particular interest, we observed enhanced Bcl-2/
adenovirus E1B 19KD interacting protein 3 (Bnip3) expression
with exercise training16, which localizes to the outer mitochon-
drial membrane and presumably interacts with Lc3 to initiate
mitochondria-specific
autophagy
(mitophagy)22.
Finally,
Vainshtein
and
colleagues
demonstrated
increased
Lc3-II
association with mitochondria and increased autophagy flux
following exhaustive treadmill running in mice19.
Using a novel mitochondrial reporter gene, called pMitoTimer,
we have shown that long-term high-fat diet induces mitochon-
drial oxidative stress and accumulation of damaged mitochondria
in mouse skeletal muscle23, which might be due to a combination
of
increased
lipid
overload
in
mitochondria
and
stalled
mitophagy. These findings illustrate the utility of MitoTimer
in monitoring mitochondrial health in vivo. Additionally, the
formation of pure red MitoTimer puncta co-localize with the
mitochondrial protein Cox4 and the lysosomal protein Lamp1,
indicative of mitochondria being selectively degraded through
mitophagy23. Given that there is currently no direct evidence that
exercise activates mitophagy or what the initial signals are that
trigger mitophagy’s induction in response to exercise, we
reasoned that pMitoTimer would allow for novel in vivo dissec-
tion of these outstanding questions.
The 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (Ampk) has been
extensively
studied
and
highly
implicated
in
skeletal
muscle adaptation in response to exercise training24, 25. The
link of Ampk to autophagy/mitophagy in skeletal muscle
comes from data on muscle-specific Ampk knockout mice
that have impaired induction of autophagy/mitophagy-related
signaling in response to fasting13 and develop more pronounced
mitochondrial abnormalities with aging13, 26. In fact, Ampk
and a downstream regulator of autophagy/mitophagy, unc-51
like autophagy activating kinase 1 (Ulk1), have been shown
to play critical roles in mitophagy in primary hepatocytes and
erythrocytes27,
28.
Ampk
activates
Ulk1
through
direct
physical interaction29 and phosphorylation at multiple sites30–32,
including
serine
555,
which
is
important
for
activation,
protein–protein interactions, and translocation of Ulk1 to the
mitochondria28, 31, 33, 34. Furthermore, studies in mice and
humans have shown that acute exercise stimulates both AMPK
and Ulk1 phosphorylation18, 31, 35, 36. Altogether, these findings
support an association between Ampk and Ulk1 in skeletal
muscle, however, there has been no direct evidence, or mechan-
istic dissection of the signaling mechanism for Ampk and Ulk1 in
control of mitophagy in skeletal muscle in response to exercise.
Elucidation of Ampk-Ulk1 signaling in control of mitophagy
could unveil one of the most important steps in exercise-mediated
improvement in skeletal muscle mitochondrial health: removal of
damaged/dysfunctional mitochondria.
We took advantage of a whole mount muscle imaging system
using pMitoTimer in combination with the lysosomal marker
gene, pLamp1-YFP (Lysosome Associated Membrane Protein 1)
23, to obtain direct evidence of mitophagy in skeletal muscle in
response to exercise. Furthermore, using mice with genetic
alteration of the Ampk-Ulk1 signaling axis, including models
with muscle-specific over-expression of either dominant-negative
(α2 isoform) or constitutively-active (γ1 isoform) Ampk and
muscle-specific knockout of Ulk1, we rigorously investigated the
role of Ampk in activation of Ulk1 in response to exercise, as
well as their individual functional roles in exercise-induced
mitophagy. We found that Ampk is required for exercise-
induced, site-specific phosphorylation of Ulk1 and this is required
for the resolution of exercise-induced mitochondrial damage
through
mitophagy
during
recovery.
Importantly,
Ulk1
is
required for metabolic adaptation to chronic exercise training.
The findings have important implications for the roles of
mitophagy and skeletal muscle mitochondrial quality control in
the health and metabolic benefits of exercise training.
Results
Exercise-induced
mitochondrial
stress
and
mitophagy.
We assessed mitochondrial oxidative status and mitophagy in
pMitoTimer-transfected adult mouse flexor digitorum brevis (FDB)
skeletal muscle in a 24-h time course following a single bout
(90 min) of treadmill running. MitoTimer is an oxidation sensitive
fluorescent protein, called Timer37, that targets to the mitochon-
dria23, hence the name MitoTimer. MitoTimer fluoresces green
when it is newly synthesized and shifts fluorescence to the red
spectrum upon oxidation23, 37. Simultaneously imaging the green
(488/518 nm) and red (543/572 nm) channels via confocal micro-
scopy allows for assessment of overall oxidative status of the
mitochondrial reticulum, reported as a red:green ratio23. Further-
more, using MitoTimer, the number of pure red mitochondrial
puncta can be determined as an indication of degenerated mito-
chondria undergoing mitophagy, since we previously demonstrated
that pure red puncta co-localize with both Cox4 immunostaining
and Lamp1-YFP23. Here, we found that the red:green ratio of the
mitochondrial reticulum was significantly shifted towards red
fluorescence at 3, 6, and 12 h following acute exercise (Fig. 1a, b,
Supplementary Fig. 1A). This time-dependent shift toward red
fluorescence, indicative of oxidative stress, is further supported by
an increase in the lipid peroxidation marker 4HNE at 3 and 6 h
following acute exercise in mitochondria-enriched fractions from
gastrocnemius muscle (Supplementary Fig. 2). In addition, the

 number of pure red puncta per fiber area was significantly increased
only at 6 h following acute exercise (Fig. 1c). We co-transfected WT
mouse FDB skeletal muscle with pMitoTimer and the lysosome
marker pLamp1-YFP, subjected them to treadmill running, and
harvested FDB muscles 6 h post-exercise, corresponding with the
peak of mitochondrial oxidative stress and mitophagy (Fig. 1a–c,
Supplementary Fig. 1). Importantly, we observed co-localization of
pure red MitoTimer puncta with Lamp1-YFP 6 h post-exercise
(Fig. 1d). This is considered evidence of autophagosome-engulfed
mitochondria
that
have
fused
with
the
lysosome,
strongly
suggesting that the increase in red puncta during recovery from
acute exercise is due to selective degradation of mitochondria
through mitophagy. Altogether, these findings provide the first
direct evidence of exercise-induced mitophagy associated with
increased mitochondrial oxidative stress.
To determine if these findings were specific to the mitochon-
drial reticulum, we transfected the contralateral FDB muscle with
ER-Timer, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) reporter analogous to
pMitoTimer, but instead containing an ER targeting sequence
fused to the Timer reporter gene. We found no change in red:

 green ratio or number of pure red puncta in the contralateral FDB
muscle (Fig. 1e–g, Supplementary Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we found
no change in protein levels of the ER-content marker Sec61a
(Supplementary Fig. 3A, E). Altogether, these data support that
the exercise-induced changes of pMitoTimer are organelle-specific.
Both the red:green ratio and number of pure red puncta
(Fig. 1a–c, Supplementary Fig. 1A) in pMitoTimer transfected
FDB muscles as well as levels of 4HNE in isolated mitochondria
(Supplementary Fig. 2) returned to control levels by 24 h post-
exercise. These findings suggest acute exercise induces a transient
mitochondrial oxidative stress along with a transient induction of
mitophagy. It is reasonable to believe that activated mitophagy in
response to exercise functions to remove certain parts of the
mitochondrial reticulum that are severely stressed/damaged,
aiding in the restoration of a healthy mitochondrial population
within 24 h of the exercise bout.
In order to further characterize mitochondrial degradation
following acute exercise, we performed western blot analysis for
mitochondria-specific proteins; the mitochondrial quality control
protein, PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (Pink1) (Supplementary
Fig. 3A, D), as well as voltage dependent anion channel (Vdac)
and translocase of outer membrane 20 (Tom20) (Supplementary
Fig. 3A–C). We did not see changes in abundance of the above
proteins in whole muscle lysates (Supplementary Fig. 3). We also
quantified mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) relative to nuclear
DNA to obtain a measure of mitochondrial content. We did
not find significant differences in mtDNA levels between
sedentary and 6 h post exercise (Supplementary Fig. 3F, G). No
change in mitochondrial content is likely due to the relative
small number of degenerated mitochondria undergoing mito-
phagy (as assessed by MitoTimer) in relation to the entire
reticulum, and thus the above assays are not sensitive enough to
detect such small changes.
Finally, in mitochondria-enriched fractions from gastrocne-
mius muscle, we observed increased Lc3-II 3 h following treadmill
running (Fig. 1h, i) but no change in Lc3-I at any time point,
which is in line with previous reports19. The timing of Lc3-II
recruitment is important since Lc3 should be degraded by
lysosomal hydrolases following fusion of autophagosome and
lysosome. Therefore, recruitment of Lc3 to mitochondria prior to

 MitoTimer co-localization with Lamp1-YFP supports the chron-
ological order of mitophagy mechanisms and definitively shows
exercise-induced mitophagy in skeletal muscle. This finding
further highlights the utility of MitoTimer as a sensitive tool to
detect individual organelle dynamics.
Activation of mitophagy signaling in response to exercise. It is
well known that Ampk can be activated by an acute bout
of exercise38, 39. We found that treadmill running increased
phosphorylation of Ampk at tyrosine (T) 172 and its downstream
substrate Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (Acc) at serine (S) 79 in
gastrocnemius muscle immediately following the exercise bout
(Fig. 2a–c). This effect was transient and not observed at later
time points during the recovery period. Concurrently, acute
exercise increased phosphorylation of Ulk1 only at the activating
S555 site28 (Fig. 2a, d). The inhibitory phosphorylation sites of
S467 or S75728 were unaltered (Fig. 2a, e, f). These findings
suggest that exercise leads to a transient phosphorylation of
Ampk and Ulk1 on activating sites, prior to mitophagic degra-
dation of targeted mitochondria during recovery from exercise
(Fig. 1a–c, Supplementary Fig. 1A).

 protein 1 (Drp1) is an important GTPase that promotes
mitochondrial fission when phosphorylated at S61640. We found
that phosphorylation of Drp1 at this site (S616) was transiently
increased immediately following treadmill running (Fig. 2a, g).
We also found that phosphorylation at site S637 was elevated
following acute exercise, reaching significance 3 and 6 hours after
the cessation of exercise (Fig. 2a, h). S637 phosphorylation has
been shown to increase fission in response to Ca2+ signaling41,
yet can also inhibit Drp1 activity under conditions of protein
kinase A (Pka)-dependent phosphorylation42–44, and has been
suggested as an Ampk target45, 46. This discrepancy in the
literature highlights the importance of context specificity of
molecular signaling. Finally, we found no alterations in the
mitochondrial fusion protein Mfn2 across the 24 h time course
following acute exercise (Fig. 2a, i).
Ampk is required for exercise-induced phosphorylation of
Ulk1. To determine whether Ampk is required for exercise-
induced activation of Ulk1, we subjected muscle-specific trans-
genic mice of a dominant-negative form of the catalytic
α2 subunit of Ampk (dnTG)47 to acute exercise. These mice were
able to complete the exercise bout to the same capacity as the wild
type littermates. Ampk phosphorylation at T172 was blunted in
dnTG mice in response to exercise (two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) interaction effect p = 0.044, F = 4.45, DF = 1) (Fig. 3a,
b); however, exercise-induced phosphorylation of Acc was not
disturbed (Fig. 3a, c), as has previously been reported for this
Ampkα mouse model and others48–50. Importantly, Ulk1 S555
phosphorylation was completely ablated in dnTG skeletal muscle
following exercise (two-way ANOVA interaction effect p = 0.015,
F = 6.71, DF = 1) (Fig. 3a, d). Phosphorylation of Ulk1 at the
inhibiting site S757 was unchanged by exercise in both WT
and dnTG mice, however, there was a genotype effect of
lower phosphorylation in the dnTG (Fig. 3a, e). Consistently,
muscle-specific transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active
form of the regulatory γ1 subunit of Ampk (caTG) showed an
increased level of Ampk T172 phosphorylation (Fig. 3f, g)51 as
well as a significant increase in Ulk1 phosphorylation at S555, but
not S757, under sedentary conditions (Fig. 3f, i, j). These mice
also displayed elevated Acc phosphorylation (Fig. 3f, h), provid-
ing additional evidence of increased Ampk activity. Altogether,
these data demonstrate that Ampk activation is sufficient and
necessary for exercise-induced Ulk1 S555 phosphorylation.
To investigate whether mitochondrial dynamics were regulated
through Ampk, we also measured Drp1 phosphorylation and
Mfn2 protein in dnTG and caTG Ampk mice. As observed in WT
exercised mice, phosphorylation of Drp1 was significantly
enhanced following acute exercise in Ampk dnTG mice at both
S616 and S637 (Fig. 4a–c). In fact, phosphorylation of S637 was
induced to a level almost twofold higher than that of WT mice
by acute exercise (two-way ANOVA interaction effect p = 0.007,
F = 8.69,
DF = 1)
(Fig.
4c).
Furthermore,
under
sedentary
conditions, caTG mice displayed similar levels of Drp1 phos-
phorylation to their WT littermates (Fig. 4e–g) and there were no
changes in Mfn2 protein, regardless of genotype or exercise
(Fig. 4a, d, e, h). These findings suggest that exercise-induced
phosphorylation of Drp1 occurs independently of Ampk in
skeletal muscle.
Ampk is required for exercise-induced mitophagy in muscle.
Since Ampk is required for activation of Ulk1 by exercise (Fig. 4),
we
investigated
whether
exercise-induced
mitophagy
is
dependent on Ampk. We performed co-transfection in FDB
muscles with pMitoTimer and pLamp1-YFP in dnTG mice. As
already described, dnTG mice were subjected to treadmill
running

 our previous experiment, we observed an overall increase of red:
green ratio 6 h following exercise in WT mice (Fig. 5a, b). In
contrast, dnTG mice showed moderately elevated oxidative stress,
but there was no further increase following exercise (two-way
ANOVA interaction effect p = 0.037, F = 4.92, DF = 1) (Fig. 5a,
b). The increase in MitoTimer pure red puncta 6 h post-exercise
observed in WT mice was completely abolished in dnTG
mice (two-way ANOVA interaction effect p < 0.0001, F = 36.26,
DF = 1) (Fig. 5a, c), demonstrating that exercise-induced mito-
phagy is blocked in dnTG mice. Importantly, acute exercise
caused an increase in Lamp1 puncta in WT mice, indicative of
increased lysosomal biogenesis (Fig. 5a, d). This effect of exercise
on lysosomal biogenesis was absent in dnTG mice (two-way
ANOVA interaction effect p = 0.019, F = 6.35, DF = 1) (Fig. 5a,
d), which is in agreement with a recent report that Ampk
deficiency dramatically reduces expression of the master gene of
lysosomal biogenesis, Tfeb52. Consistent with the notion that
Ampk is required for exercise-induced mitophagy, co-localization
of Lamp1 puncta with pure red mitochondrial puncta was
abolished in dnTG mice (two-way ANOVA interaction effect
p = 0.0002, F = 20.08, DF = 1) (Fig. 5e). This effect was also
severely blunted when co-localized Lamp1 puncta were assessed
as a percentage of total Lamp1 puncta (Fig. 5f). Altogether, these
findings provide the first direct evidence that Ampk is required
for exercise-induced mitophagy in skeletal muscle.
Ulk1 is required for exercise-induced lysosomal targeting. Since
Ulk1 is a critical regulator of autophagy and is activated by
acute exercise (Fig. 2), Ulk1 may be important for mitophagy to
remove damaged/dysfunctional mitochondria during recovery
in response to acute exercise (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). To
address this question, we again co-transfected FDB muscles with
pMitoTimer and pLamp1-YFP in muscle-specific Ulk1 knockout
(MKO) mice. As described above, mice were then subjected to
acute exercise, and FDB muscles were harvested 6 h later (Fig. 1,
Fig. 6, and Supplementary Fig. 1). There was no difference in
basal red:green ratio of MitoTimer between the WT and MKO

 mice (Fig. 6a, b). Furthermore, the overall increase of the red:
green ratio 6 h after exercise was similar between genotypes
(Fig. 6a, b), indicating that deletion of Ulk1 did not alter the
responsiveness of mitochondria to exercise with regard to
oxidative stress. In WT mice, there was an increase in MitoTimer
pure red puncta after exercise (Fig. 6a, c), which was concurrent
with both increases in Lamp1 puncta (Fig. 6d) and co-localization
between the two signals (Fig. 6e, f). These findings consolidate
those from our previous experiments (Fig. 1 and Fig. 5), therefore,
we are confident that mitophagy is increased during recovery in
response to exercise. Furthermore, there was no increase in pure
red puncta in skeletal muscle in MKO mice (two-way ANOVA
interaction effect p = 0.039, F = 4.62, DF = 1) (Fig. 6a, c) even
though there was a significant increase of Lamp1 puncta above
WT levels with exercise (Fig. 6d). These findings indicate that
Ulk1 is not required for lysosomal biogenesis. Importantly, the
co-localization of Lamp1 puncta with MitoTimer pure red puncta
was dramatically impaired in MKO mice compared with WT
mice (Fig. 6e, f). This was evident in both the co-localization
of Lamp1 puncta per fiber area (two-way ANOVA interaction

co-localization
to

interaction effect p = 0.10, F = 2.81, DF = 1) (Fig. 7f). Altogether,
these findings strongly demonstrate that Ulk1 is required
for exercise-induced mitophagy and has an important role in
targeting the lysosome to mitochondria selected for degradation.
Ulk1 is important for metabolic adaptation to exercise. Since
we reported that Ulk1 is critical for acute exercise-induced
mitophagy, we reasoned that it would also play a critical role in
exercise training adaptation and endurance capacity. Therefore,
we subjected MKO and WT mice to 6 weeks of voluntary
wheel running and performed an exhaustive exercise test at the
cessation of exercise training. Unexpectedly, daily voluntary
running distance was similar between genotypes, and both
genotypes improved their endurance running capacity after
6 weeks of voluntary running compared to sedentary controls
(Fig. 7a, b), suggesting that Ulk1 is not required for enhanced
physical performance in response to exercise training. In order
to further validate these findings and rule out developmental
compensation to loss of Ulk1 from early life, we generated

compared
with
WT mice, as well as similar improvement in endurance capacity
following 6 weeks of voluntary exercise training (Fig. 7d, e). Blood
lactate concentration changes with exercise were consistent with
exhaustion and improved metabolic adaption with exercise in
both genetic mouse models (Fig. 7c, f); however, iMKO mice had
significantly higher blood lactate than wild type upon exhaustion
(Fig. 7f, Supplementary Fig. 5).
To further investigate the importance of skeletal muscle Ulk1
in exercise training-induced adaptation, we performed glucose
tolerance tests (GTTs) in WT and iMKO mice following 4 weeks
of voluntary wheel running. WT mice that performed exercise
training displayed significantly better glucose tolerance compared
to their sedentary counterparts as well as exercise trained
iMKO mice, as indicated by improved blood glucose clearance
during GTT and area under the glucose curve (two-way ANOVA
interaction effect p = 0.001, F = 19.52, DF = 1) (Fig. 7g–i).
In contrast, iMKO mice showed no improvement in glucose
tolerance following 4 weeks of exercise training (Fig. 7h, i).
Altogether, these data suggest that while skeletal muscle Ulk1
may not contribute to improvements in endurance capacity, Ulk1
in skeletal muscle is important to confer the metabolic benefits of
exercise training.
Discussion
Our data provides the first direct evidence that a single bout of
exercise induces mitophagy in skeletal muscle during recovery.
We observed increased mitochondrial oxidative stress between
3–12 h with increased MitoTimer pure red puncta 6 h following
acute exercise, suggesting that upstream signaling mechanisms
were initiated prior to the mitophagy events. Consistent with
this notion, we observed temporal activation of Ampk and
Ulk1 immediately after acute exercise and demonstrated that
Ampk was both necessary and sufficient for phosphorylation of
Ulk1 at S555 in skeletal muscle. Importantly, we have obtained
comprehensive evidence that both Ampk and Ulk1 are required
for exercise-induced mitophagy during recovery. While Ampk is

Fig. 7 Ulk1 in skeletal muscle is important for exercise training-induced metabolic adaptation. MKO and iMKO mice displayed normal adaptation to
exercise training as assessed by daily running distance a, d, exhaustive exercise test b, e and blood lactate levels c, f. WT mice exhibited improved glucose

improved glucose tolerance following exercise training during GTT h and AUC i. Data presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. For MKO study n =

 involved in Ulk1 activation and lysosomal biogenesis, our data
does not support the notion that Ampk promotes mitochondrial
fission through Drp1. Finally, we demonstrate the novel finding
that Ulk1 is required for mitophagy at the step of lysosomal
targeting of damaged/dysfunctional mitochondria (Fig. 8). Hence,
we show for the first time that mitophagy during recovery from
exercise in skeletal muscle is dependent upon the transient
activation of Ulk1 through Ampk.
Mitochondria are the main source of reactive oxygen species
(ROS), primarily through leak of single electrons from the
electron transport chain during oxidative phosphorylation53, 54.
During exhaustive exercise, free radical (e.g., reactive oxygen
species,
or
ROS)
concentrations
within
the
mitochondria
increase55, disrupting redox homeostasis and causing oxidative
stress56. Oxidation of mtDNA, respiratory chain complexes,
and/or lipids are thought to be the primary targets of free radicals,
resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and initiating mitochon-
drial maintenance adaptation55, 57, such as through their removal
and degradation7. In the current study, the overall shift
in MitoTimer red:green ratio is indicative of an increase in
mitochondrial oxidative stress 6 h post exercise. In line with this
observation, 4HNE, a common marker of oxidative stress, was
also increased in mitochondria-enriched fractions at 3 and 6 h
post exercise. These data are consistent with the notion that
during recovery from exercise, continued oxidative phosphor-
ylation and dramatic reduction of ATP consumption dominate
the excessive production of mitochondrial ROS. These observa-
tions are important for development of future interventions to
improve muscle recovery from an acute exercise bout.
It is worth mentioning that acute exercise did not lead to
oxidation of the Timer protein when it was targeted to the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER-Timer). Although others have shown
that acute endurance exercise activates ER-stress in skeletal
muscle58, 59, we must highlight that ER-Timer detects only
oxidation of the Timer protein and not specific activation of the
unfolded protein response (UPR). Although changes in cellular
redox can indeed cause ER-stress, aberrant Ca2+ regulation and
glucose deprivation have also been implicated in initiating the
UPR60. Since ER oxidative status was not measured in studies
reporting exercise-induced ER-stress58, 59, we caution against the
over interpretation of our findings with ER-timer as counter to
the current literature.
While we have demonstrated here that Ampk and Ulk1 are
indeed required for mitophagy in skeletal muscle within the
context of exercise, the mechanism of how the mitochondrial
damage signal and activation of mitophagic machinery is coor-
dinated has yet to be fully elucidated. Mitochondrial damage
causes the accumulation of Pink1 on the mitochondrial outer
membrane, recruiting Parkin. Parkin subsequently ubiquitinates
mitochondrial proteins61, 62, initiating the separation of that
region of the reticulum through fission upon accumulation, then
leading to degradation through mitophagy62, 63. While exercise
training increases Pink1 mRNA in human skeletal muscle64 and
Parkin protein content deceases following exercise in mice65,
these findings are far from conclusive. We did not find significant
changes in Pink1 protein in skeletal muscle following acute
exercise. We cannot rule out a role for Pink1 in exercise-induced
mitophagy. In our hands, it is just as likely that we did not
detect changes in Pink1 using western blotting because of
the small fraction of “ear marked” red mitochondrial puncta.
Whether Ampk/Ulk1 interact with Pink/Parkin to facilitate
mitophagy in response to exercise or through another, unknown
mechanism, to distinguish damaged mitochondria remains an
outstanding question.
We noticed that the pure red puncta are always dissociated
from the mitochondrial reticulum in skeletal muscle (Figs. 1, 5, 6
and Supplementary Fig. 1). This is consistent with the notion that
selective mitophagy in regions of the mitochondria that are
dysfunctional
require
mitochondrial
fission.
Interestingly,
Ampk has also been shown to promote fragmentation of the
mitochondrial network and directly phosphorylate the mito-
chondrial fission factor (Mff), which is a Drp1 receptor required
to recruit Drp1 to the mitochondrial membrane66. In support
of this concept, Vainshtein and colleagues reported increase
mitochondrial associated Drp1 immediately following exhaustive
exercise in mice19. We also found that phosphorylation of Drp1
was initiated immediately following acute exercise in the skeletal
muscle, supporting the notion of targeted mitochondrial fission
prior to mitophagic degradation. However, whether Drp1 was
specifically associated with damaged or dysfunctional mitochon-
drial remains unknown. In contrast to some reports45, 46, in our
hands Ampk does not appear to be responsible for phosphor-
ylation of Drp1 at either S616 or S637 since we observed
significant increases in phosphorylation levels after acute exercise
in dnTG mice. However, one could speculate that Ampk plays a
role in fine-tuning of Drp1 and mitochondrial fission after
exercise since phosphorylation of S637 in dnTG mice was further
enhanced above WT levels after exercise.
Importantly,
in
mice
lacking
functional
Ampk
(dnTG)
in
skeletal
muscle
we
observed
a
tendency
for
elevated
MitoTimer red:green ratio, even at the basal level. These
observations may be reflective of Ampk’s role in regulation of
antioxidant defense67, 68, and suggests a basal elevation of mito-
chondrial oxidative stress. However, there was no further increase
in the red:green ratio following acute exercise suggesting that
mitochondrial ROS production plateaued at the basal level in
dnTG skeletal muscle and the acute exercise caused no further
elevation. In the MKO mice, however, there was no elevation of
MitoTimer red:green ratio, at the basal level, suggesting that
deletion of the Ulk1 gene, unlike inhibition of Ampk, does not
cause mitochondrial oxidative stress.
On the other hand, MKO mice displayed a similar phenotype
of lacking increased pure red puncta in response to exercise. This
impaired mitophagy does not necessarily indicate that there are
no damaged mitochondria, particularly in light of elevated
overall MitoTimer red:green ratio after exercise. Instead, these
observations
are
indicative
of
defective
targeting
of
the
autophagic machinery to the specific damaged mitochondria.
This notion is supported by studies that identified a critical
interaction between Ulk1 and the scaffold protein Htt, which is
required for selective autophagy (including mitophagy), but not

Fig. 8 Acute exercise-induced mitophagy is regulated through the Ampk-
Ulk1 signaling axis. Ampk activation through phosphorylation at T172 is
required for exercise-induced phosphorylation of Ulk1 S555 and lysosomal
biogenesis in skeletal muscle. Simultaneously, exercise initiates
mitochondrial fission, which is not dependent on Ampk activation. We
demonstrate that Ulk1 is critical for targeting of the lysosome to the
damage/dysfunctional mitochondrial puncta for subsequent degradation

 non-selective autophagy69. Rui and colleagues show that the
physical interaction of Htt with Ulk1 is required to guide Ulk1 to
the site of autophagosome formation, and the loss of Htt causes
impaired autophagosome sequestration of selective cargo69. These
observations are consistent with our current findings when Ulk1
was specifically depleted in skeletal muscle. Therefore, in the
absence of Ulk1, the selective targeting of Htt to the site of
autophagosome formation may either be impaired or ineffective
since the role of Ulk1 in regulating autophagosome formation
may not be realized. The acute consequence of which is the
defective sequestration of selective autophagic/mitophagic targets
and potential accumulation of damaged organelles in the cell.
Indeed, it appears that Ulk1 may play an important role in
exercise training-induced metabolic adaptation since iMKO mice
showed no improvement in glucose tolerance following 4 weeks
of voluntary wheel running and limited adaptation in lactate
metabolism during an
exhaustive running
test. Therefore,
Ulk1 could be a critical regulator for proper metabolic regulation
during other metabolic challenges (e.g., resistance exercise, high-
fat diet, and aging).
In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that acute exercise
induces mitophagy through Ampk-dependent activation of Ulk1 in
skeletal muscle. Furthermore, deletion of the Ulk1 gene in skeletal
muscle inhibits mitophagy without affecting lysosome formation in
response to exercise, which suggests to us a novel role for Ulk1 in
targeting of lysosomes to damaged/dysfunctional mitochondria that
has implications for metabolic adaptations to exercise training.
Methods
Animals. All experimental procedures were approved by the University of Virginia,
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For post-exercise time course
experiments, male C57BL/6 J mice (10–12 weeks old) were obtained commercially
(Jackson Laboratories). For assessing mitophagy-related signaling basally,
immediately post-exercise, and 6 h post exercise, male muscle-specific, dominant-
negative (dnTG) Ampk α2 (12–13 weeks old)47 and male constitutively-active (caTG)
Ampk γ1 (13–15 weeks old)51 were bred and raised in house at the University of
Virginia. MKO and iMKO mice were obtained by crossbreeding between Ulk1f/f 27
and MCK-Cre (Jackson Laboratory) and between Ulk1f/f and HAS-MerCreMer mice
(generous gift of Dr Karyn Esser), respectively. For examining mitophagy 6 h post
exercise and following exercise training, MKO mice (12–13-weeks old) and iMKO
mice (18–20-weeks old) were bred in house. Prior to use, iMKO were injected i.p.
with tamoxifen (1 mg/25 mg body weight) once daily for 5 days to induce knock out
of the Ulk1 gene. All mice were housed in temperature-controlled (21 °C) quarters
with 12:12-h light-dark cycle and ad libitum access to water and chow (Purina). We
chose to study the FDB muscle located in the base of the hindlimb foot. This decision
was primarily based on the practical advantages of the location and size of the muscle
for ease of plasmid transfection and whole mount imaging. In addition, the FDB
muscle is known to be recruited during exercise and adapts to exercise training23 and
displays increased Ampk activity in response to ex vivo contraction70, 71. The FDB is
composed of mostly type IIa fibers, which are fast, oxidative and contain an inter-
mediate sized mitochondrial pool and autophagy protein abundance is also inter-
mediate, between type I and IIb muscle types16. Therefore, it is an ideal muscle for the
purposes of this study.
Plasmid DNA and transfection. We designed and validated pMitoTimer as a
useful tool for measuring mitochondrial health and damage as previously
published23. pLamp1-YFP was purchased from Addgene (Plasmid #1816). Plasmid
constructs were transfected into the FDB muscle by somatic gene transfer as
previously published23, 72. Briefly, the mice were anesthetized (isofluorane) and the
base of each hind limb foot, where the FDB is located, was injected with 10 μl of
hyaluronidase (0.36 mg/ml; Sigma) subcutaneously. One hour later the mice were
anesthetized a second time and the FDB injected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA. In
cases where pMitoTimer and pLamp1-YFP were co-transfected, they were mixed in
a 1:1 ratio and 20 μg of total plasmid DNA were injected. Ten minutes later a pair
of gold-plated acupuncture needles were inserted under the skin at the heel and
base of the toes parallel to each other and perpendicular to the long axis of the foot.
Ten pulses with 20 ms duration at 1 hz and 75 V/cm were applied to each foot. To
allow for the mice to recover and plasmid expression to be stable we allowed
10 days before performing any experiments.
Tissue preparation and confocal microscopy. At the time of muscle harvest, the
FDB was immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and whole
mounted on gelatin coated slides with 50% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline
with a coverslip. Images were acquired at ×100 magnification under a confocal
microscope (Olympus Fluoview FV1000) using the green (excitation/emission
488/518 nm) and red (excitation/emission 543/572 nm) channels with identical
pre-determined acquisition parameters for all samples to ensure no saturation of
the signals and similar intensity of the green and red channels in control samples.
Lamp1-YFP images were acquired using the yellow channel (excitation/emission
515/527). MitoTimer signals were analyzed using our custom-designed Matlab-
based algorithm as previously published23. Co-localization of pure red MitoTimer
puncta and yellow Lamp1 puncta was quantified by an updated algorithm.
Acute exercise. Mice were acclimatized to the treadmill for 3 consecutive days
prior to the experimental day. Acclimatization consisted of 10 min of treadmill
running at 0% incline and speed of 13 m/min each day. On the day of acute
exercise, mice allocated to perform treadmill running were subject to 5% incline
and 10 min at 13 m/min, 10 min at 16 m/min, 50 min at 19 m/min, and then
20 min at 21 m/min. Mice were sacrificed at the indicated time points following
treadmill running.
Exercise training, endurance capacity, and glucose tolerance. Ulk1 MKO,
iMKO and WT littermates were housed individually in cages with running wheels
and sedentary mice we kept together in cages not equipped with running wheels.
Exercising mice were allowed free access to the running wheel and all mice were
provided food and water ad libitum. Daily running distance was recorded via
computer monitoring. In iMKO mice, after 4 weeks of voluntary wheel running,
running wheels were locked for 24 h and mice were subjected to a GTT.
Following a 6 h fast, blood glucose from the tail vein was measured prior to and
following i.p. injection of sterilized D-glucose (2 mg/g) at 30, 60, and 120 min.
Running wheels were subsequently unlocked and one week later mice were
subjected to an exhaustive exercise test. Mice were acclimatized to the treadmill
as described above. On the day of testing the treadmill was set to 5% incline
and run at 13 m/min for 30 min. Running speed was increased by 3 m/min
every 30 min until perceived exhaustion. Blood lactate was measured prior to
and at the time of exercise cessation.
Western blotting. Total protein or mitochondrial-enriched lysates were subjected
to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred
onto nitrocellulose membrane. Mitochondrial-enriched lysates were isolated via
differential centrifugation from frozen gastrocnemius muscle. Briefly, muscles were
pulverized by mortar and pestle and placed in 1 ml fractionation (FRAC) buffer
[20 mM HEPES, 250 mM Sucrose, 0.1 mM EDTA, plus protease (Roche Diag-
nostics) and phosphatase (Sigma) inhibitors] then sonicated. Whole-tissue lysates
were then spun at 800×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were then spun at 9000×g
for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in FRAC
buffer then spun at 11,000×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Resulting mitochondrial-enriched
pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of lamelli buffer, boiled for 5 min at 97 °C, then
frozen at −80 °C until further analysis.
Membranes were probed with the following primary antibodies at 1:1000
dilution, targeting Lc3A/B (CST #4108), T172 Ampk (CST #2535), Ampk α1/2

α-Tubulin (mouse, Abcam #11304), and Gapdh (CST #2118). All antibodies are
sourced from rabbit unless otherwise noted above. All blots were cut at desired kDa
ranges depending upon the predicted location for proteins of interest after
Ponseau-S staining to maximize the utility of each blot by probing for multiple
proteins, with the same source, at once. secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse
IR680 and goat anti-rabbit IR800 (LICOR). Membranes were scanned using the
Odyssey infrared imaging system (LICOR). Proteins were analyzed in comparison
to a common protein standard loaded on gel, prior calculating phospho:total ratio.
All uncropped scans can be found in Supplementary Figs. 5–11.
Mitochondrial DNA quantification. DNA was isolated from gastrocnemius
and plantaris muscles using standard DNA isolation procedures, and real-time
qPCR was used to quantify mtDNA (Cytochrome B) and expressed relative
to nDNA (Gapdh). Sequences of primers used are as follows; Cytochrome B:
(f) 5′—ACG TCC TTC CAT GAG GAC AA—3′; (r) 5′—GGA GGT GAA CGA
TTG CTA GG—3′ and Gapdh: (f) 5′—ACC CAG AAG ACT GTG GAT GG—3′;
(r) 5′—CAC ATT GGG GGT AGG AAC AC—3′.
Statistical analyses. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. Time course
experiments are analyzed via one-way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls post-hoc
analysis. Where two variables are present, data was analyzed using two-way
ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc analysis where appropriate. Where one variable is
present, data was analyzed using Student’s t-test. Data with significantly unequal
variance was transformed prior to statistical analysis. Statistical significance was
established a priori as p < 0.05.
