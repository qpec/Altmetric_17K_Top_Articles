Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3–transforming acidic coiled-coil contain-
ing protein 3 (FGFR3–TACC3; FT3) is a gene fusion resulting from
rearrangement of chromosome 4 that has been identified in many cancers
including those of the urinary bladder. Altered FGFR3 signalling in FT3-
positive cells is thought to contribute to cancer progression. However, poten-
tial changes in TACC3 function in these cells have not been explored. TACC3
is a mitotic spindle protein required for accurate chromosome segregation.
Errors in segregation lead to aneuploidy, which can contribute to cancer pro-
gression. Here we show that FT3-positive bladder cancer cells have lower
levels of endogenous TACC3 on the mitotic spindle, and that this is suffi-
cient to cause mitotic defects. FT3 is not localized to the mitotic spindle,
and by virtue of its TACC domain, recruits endogenous TACC3 away
from the spindle. Knockdown of the fusion gene or low-level overexpression
of TACC3 partially rescues the chromosome segregation defects in FT3-
positive bladder cancer cells. This function of FT3 is specific to TACC3 as
inhibition of FGFR3 signalling does not rescue the TACC3 level on the spin-
dle in these cancer cells. Models of FT3-mediated carcinogenesis should,
therefore, include altered mitotic functions of TACC3 as well as altered
FGFR3 signalling.
1. Introduction
Gene fusions are the result of structural chromosomal rearrangements and are
considered driver mutations in cancer [1]. Besides classical fusions detected in
blood cancers, fusion genes are also found in several solid tumour types includ-
ing bladder carcinoma [2]. Bladder cancer is mainly associated with an
activating point mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3)
which has been found in more than 80% of cases of low-grade tumours; how-
ever, an FGF3–transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 3 (FGFR3–
TACC3; FT3) fusion gene has recently been identified in bladder cancer [3].
FT3 is formed due to intrachromosomal rearrangement of chromosome 4,
between FGFR3 and TACC3. The fusion has been identified in other cancers
including glioblastoma multiforme and non-small cell lung cancer [4]. FGFR3
belongs to the FGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases [5]. Normally, FGFR
is activated by FGF-heparin binding to monomeric FGFRs, resulting in dimer-
ization and transphosphorylation in the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain.
This event leads to activation of several downstream signalling pathways
including MAPK [6]. Aberrant activation of FGFR signalling has been impli-
cated in cell proliferation and tumourigenesis [6].
TACC3 is a cancer-associated protein belonging to the TACC family [7], and
is important for mitotic spindle stability [8,9]. Aurora-A-mediated phosphoryl-
ation of TACC3 is important for its association with clathrin and localization to
mitotic spindle microtubules [10–12]. TACC3, together with clathrin and

 ch-TOG, forms a ternary complex which acts as a cross-linker
between adjacent microtubules (MTs) [10,13]. Recently, it has
been shown that such cross-links make a network, termed
‘the mesh’ which is required for organization of kinetochore
fibre MTs [8]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that altera-
tion of TACC3 levels causes disorganization of kinetochore
fibres and alters mitotic progression and normal chromosome
segregation [8,14,15]. TACC3 levels are found to be altered in
many human cancers including bladder cancer [16]. Either an
increase or a decrease in TACC3 levels results in a mitotic
delay together with mitotic defects [8,9,17]. Such defects
during mitosis can lead to aneuploidy and may contribute
to cancer initiation and/or progression [18]. TACC3 contains
a C-terminal coiled-coil domain (TACC domain, 638–838 aa)
which enables dimerization of TACC3 and even its multimer-
ization under certain circumstances [7,19,20]. Since the TACC
domain features in the FT3 fusion, it is thought that this
results in constitutive activation of FGFR3 signalling, similar
to the mechanism of other fusions involving receptor tyrosine
kinases [21,22].
The investigation of the role of FT3 in oncogenesis has so
far focused on the role of FGFR3 signalling, while the impact
on TACC3 has been relatively unexplored. It was suggested
that the presence of a TACC3 domain in FT3 results in a spin-
dle pole localization during mitosis and thereby causes severe
mitotic defects and aneuploidy [22]. Inhibition of FGFR3
kinase activity by PD173074 rescued FT3-induced aneu-
ploidy. However, the exact mechanism by which FT3
induces such defects was not addressed. Here, we investigate
the association between FT3 and mitotic defects observed in
bladder cancer cells and describe a TACC3-specific role for
FT3 in this process.
2. Results
2.1. FT3 causes mitotic defects but does not localize to
the mitotic spindle
It was previously shown that glioblastoma cells with FT3
gene fusions have defects in chromosome segregation [22].
This was attributed to FT3 localizing to the spindle pole
and somehow affecting normal mitosis. We began investi-
gating the role of FT3 in chromosome segregation by
examining the localization of FT3-GFP in HeLa cells. FT3-
GFP(649–838) did not localize to the mitotic spindle nor to
centrosomes but was present outside the spindle region in
structures reminiscent of membrane vesicles (figure 1b,c).
The presence of FT3 in vesicles is to be expected for a trans-
membrane protein. This result is similar to the previous
report in glioblastoma cells [22].
Next, to see the effect of FT3 on mitosis, live-cell imaging
was carried out in asynchronously growing HeLa cells
expressing FT3-GFP(649–838) or GFP as a control, together
with H2B-mCherry to visualize chromosome dynamics.
Expression of FT3-GFP(649–838) increased the number of
abnormal mitotic figures compared with expression of GFP
(figure 1d). Expression of this fusion did not cause a delay
in mitotic progression (nuclear envelope breakdown to ana-
phase)
compared
with
control
cells
expressing
GFP
(figure 1e). Again, this is similar to a previous report using
Rat1A cells [22]. These results suggest that expression of
FT3 induces defects in mitosis, but that this effect is indepen-
dent of localization at the spindle pole or mitotic spindle.
2.2. FT3 induces mitotic defects by altering the levels
of endogenous TACC3 at the mitotic spindle
While studying the localization of FT3 in mitotic cells, we
noticed that ectopic expression of FT3 caused a reduction in
endogenous
TACC3
levels
on
the
mitotic
spindle
(figure 2a,b). This reduction also caused a partial loss of
clathrin and ch-TOG from the spindle (electronic supplemen-
tary material, figure S2). In order to investigate the TACC3
removal
effect
further,
we
measured
the
endogenous
TACC3 levels on the mitotic spindle in two different FT3-
positive bladder cancer cell lines (RT112 and RT4). The FT3
fusions expressed in RT112 and RT4 have similar lengths of
FGFR3 but different lengths of TACC3 (figure 2c) [3]. The
endogenous TACC3 was detected using an antibody against
the TACC3 N-terminus, because this part of TACC3 is absent
in both FT3 fusions. To test for a role for FT3 in setting the
endogenous TACC3 levels on the spindle, we specifically
depleted FT3 in RT112 or RT4 cell lines using RNAi and com-
pared this with control RNAi. To do this, we designed
siRNAs which specifically targeted the FT3 transcripts in
RT112 or RT4 cells (electronic supplementary material,
figure S3). Upon knockdown of FT3, the endogenous
TACC3 level on the spindle was significantly higher than
the control cells in both RT112 and RT4 cells (figure 2d).
These results suggest that the presence of FT3 causes a
reduction in endogenous TACC3 levels on the mitotic spin-
dle. Previously it has been documented that knockdown of
TACC3 causes a delay in mitotic progression together with
defects in chromosome segregation [10,17]. In order to test
the effect of a reduction in endogenous TACC3 levels
during mitosis in the FT3-positive cells, we monitored mitotic
progression in these cells. We found that the presence of
FT3 causes several mitotic defects including unaligned
chromosomes during prometaphase/metaphase and the
formation
of
lagging
chromosomes
during
anaphase
(figure 2e). Knockdown of FT3 partially rescued these
phenotypes. Surprisingly, we did not notice any considerable
change in mitotic timing in cells with FT3 versus those
with FT3 removed (figure 2f ). The changes caused by
depletion of TACC3 by RNAi in RT112 cells are much more
severe
suggesting
that
the
removal
of
TACC3
from
spindles in cells expressing FT3 is only partial. These results
suggest that the presence of FT3 causes mitotic defects
primarily by reducing the level of endogenous TACC3 at
the mitotic spindle.
2.3. Mild overexpression of TACC3 partially rescues the
mitotic phenotypes of FT3-positive RT112 cells
If the mitotic defects observed in FT3-positive cancer cells are
due to reduced TACC3 level on the mitotic spindle, then
increasing the level of TACC3 by overexpression in these
cells should rescue the defects. Simply overexpressing GFP-
TACC3 from a CMV promoter would fail because strong
overexpression of TACC3 causes severe mitotic defects in
HeLa cells [8]. We therefore expressed GFP-TACC3 at a
much lower level using its own promoter to see if we could
rescue defects caused by FT3 (figure 3a,b). Synchronized

 RT112 cells expressing GFP-TACC3 or GFP together with
H2B-mCherry were imaged to monitor mitotic progression.
We found that expressing TACC3 at a low level did indeed
partially rescue the abnormal mitotic phenotype of FT3-
positive RT112 cells (figure 3c). Again, we did not notice
any significant change in mitotic timing between GFP-
TACC3 and GFP positive RT112 cells (figure 3d). These
results further confirm that mitotic defects in FT3-positive
cells are caused by a reduction in the levels of endogenous
TACC3 at the mitotic spindle.
2.4. Decrease in spindle TACC3 levels is due to a TACC3-
specific function of FT3
How does FT3 decrease TACC3 levels at the mitotic spindle?
It could be via a function of the FGFR3 or the TACC3 com-
ponent of FT3. We tested if the TACC3 component of FT3
was sufficient to reduce endogenous TACC3 levels at the
mitotic spindle. To do this, the FGFR3 component of FT3
was replaced with the alpha chain of CD8, a transmembrane
protein [23]. CD8-TACC3(649–838) tagged at the C-terminus
with mCherry for visualization was expressed in normal
TERT-B bladder cells and compared with CD8-mCherry,
with
no
TACC
domain,
and
also
with
FT3(649–
838)-mCherry. We found that in the presence of CD8-
TACC3(649–838)-mCherry, the level of endogenous TACC3
on the mitotic spindle was lower compared with CD8-
mCherry alone (figure 4a). The reduction of TACC3 level
due to CD8-TACC3(649–838)-mCherry was comparable to
FT3(649–838)-mCherry (figure 4a,b). We next assessed mito-
tic progression in cells expressing these constructs together
with H2B-GFP in HeLa cells. We found an increase in abnor-
mal mitotic figures in the presence of CD8-TACC3-mCherry
compared with CD8-mCherry (figure 4c). This increase was
similar to expression of FT3 (figure 4c). Mitotic progression
was
unaffected
(figure
4d).
The
CD8-TACC3
results
strengthen our previous observation that a reduction of
TACC3 levels on mitotic spindles increases errors in mitosis.
Second, they also suggest a mechanism whereby a TACC
domain localized at the plasma membrane can recruit
TACC3 away from its site of action on the mitotic spindle.
Third, because we could phenocopy the effect of FT3
expression using CD8-TACC3, which lacked an FGFR3

 component, it suggests that the mitotic defects are indepen-
dent of FGFR3 activity.
Although unlikely, we next tested if constitutive signal-
ling from the FGFR3 kinase domain of FT3 can reduce
TACC3 levels at the spindle. We measured the endogenous
TACC3 level at the mitotic spindle upon inhibition of
FGFR3 kinase activity using the small molecule FGFR
kinase inhibitor PD173074 [24]. Inhibition of FGFR3 kinase
activity was measured by detecting ERK1/2 phosphoryl-
ation. FT3 is constitutively phosphorylated in RT112 cells,
which leads to increase in FT3 activation and upregulation
of ERK1/2 phosphorylation [3]. FT3-driven MAPK signalling
in RT112 cells can be inhibited by 500 nM PD173074
(figure 4e). We measured the endogenous TACC3 level on
the mitotic spindle in the presence of the drug and found
no
observable
change
compared
with
DMSO
alone
(figure 4f ). To further investigate whether FGFR3 signalling
has any role in the abnormal mitotic phenotype observed in
RT112 cells, mitotic progression was monitored in cells trea-
ted with 500 nM PD173074 or DMSO alone. We observed
only a small increase in the percentage of cells with normal
mitosis (figure 4g), and
no change
in mitotic
timing
(figure 4h). This result suggests that FGFR3 signalling has a
minor, if any, effect on chromosome segregation in these
cells. Whatever its contribution, FGFR3 signalling does not
cause removal of TACC3 from the mitotic spindle. Our results
clearly indicate that the reduced level of TACC3 at the mitotic
spindle is the cause of mitotic problems in FT3-positive
cancer cell lines and that this reduction is due to a TACC3-
specific function of FT3.
2.5. TACC3 region of FT3 can bind and recruit
endogenous TACC3
Since the TACC3 region of FT3 is primarily involved in
removal of endogenous TACC3 from the mitotic spindle, we
hypothesized that FT3 must bind endogenous TACC3 to
recruit it away from the spindle. If this model is correct, we
should be able to detect binding between FT3 and endogenous
TACC3. Accordingly, we immunoprecipitated TACC3 using
the N-terminal antibody, which would precipitate endogenous
TACC3 but not FT3. Using this strategy, we detected endogen-
ous TACC3 selectively binding to FT3 (figure 5a). This binding
is specific to FT3 because endogenous TACC3 did not
co-immunoprecipitate FGFR3 in FT3-negative TERT-B cells
(figure 5b). The TACC3–FT3 interaction takes place during
mitosis in RT112 cells (figure 5a).

 Since the TACC domain of TACC3 is an obligate dimer
and is capable of multimerization [7,19], it seems likely that
the interaction between FT3 and endogenous TACC3 occurs
via the TACC3 component of FT3 rather than the FGFR3 com-
ponent. To test this model, we looked to see if differentially
tagged TACC3 dimers can bind to each other. Using

 MBP-TACC3 we could detect binding to GST-TACC3 in vitro,
but not to GST alone (figure 5c). This effect was probably due
to the TACC domain which is present in FT3 because we saw
a similar interaction when MBP-TACC3(500–838) and GST-
TACC3(500–838) proteins were used (figure 5d). We also
note that Aurora-A phosphorylation of TACC3 is not
required for TACC domain multimerization (figure 5c,d).
Overall our data clearly suggest that FT3 is capable of bind-
ing endogenous TACC3 and this association takes place via
the TACC domain found in FT3.
4. Discussion
We have studied why FT3 expression in cancer cells results in
mitotic defects. Wefound that FT3 does not localize to the mito-
tic spindle or centrosomes and is instead found in vesicular
structures expected of a transmembrane protein. We showed
that the TACC domain of FT3 bindsto and recruits endogenous
TACC3 from the spindle. This reduction in TACC3 levels on the
mitotic spindle is the primary cause of mitotic defects. This
mechanism, summarized in figure 6, acts together with
aberrant signalling to drive cells towards oncogenesis.
Previous reports suggested that FT3 expression causes
severe mitotic defects and delays mitosis in Rat1A cells. It
was inferred that this function could be due to its localization
at the spindle pole during mitosis [22]. We found that
expression of FT3-GFP in HeLa cells induced mitotic defects
without being localized to the spindle pole region or mitotic
spindle. The localization pattern of FT3-GFP, a transmem-
brane
protein,
indicated
that
it
is
found
in
vesicles
throughout the cell. This is in agreement with a previous
study where FT3 was shown to be localized at the cell surface
in RT112 bladder cancer cells [3]. Because FT3 is vesicular
and not actually resident at the spindle, an alternative expla-
nation for mitotic defects was required.
Our results suggest that the presence of FT3 induces mito-
tic defects by removing TACC3 from the mitotic spindle. This
is possible due to the TACC3 portion of the fusion. Our evi-
dence for this is threefold. First, FT3 can bind endogenous
TACC3 via its TACC domain. This association between FT3
and endogenous TACC3 occurs throughout the cell cycle,

Figure 5. FT3 interacts with endogenous TACC3 via its TACC domain. (a) Co-immunoprecipitation of FT3 with endogenous TACC3 in interphase and mitosis. Whole-
cell extracts of RT112 asynchronously growing or synchronized in mitosis were subjected for immunoprecipitation using agarose-conjugated TACC3 antibody directed
to the N-terminus, followed by western blotting using anti-FGFR3 and anti-TACC3. Long exposure is shown to confirm the presence of TACC3 in the whole-cell
extract. (b) Co-immunoprecipitation of FT3 with endogenous TACC3 in RT112 versus TERT-B cells, as in (a). Note, TERT-B does not have FT3 and was used as
a negative control for co-IP of FGFR3 with TACC3. (c) Interaction between full-length MBP-TACC3 and GST-TACC3. Western blot to show the amount of MBP-
TACC3 bound to GST or GST-TACC3. MBP-TACC3 was detected by anti-MBP antibody and a Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) gel was run to confirm the presence
of GST and GST-TACC3, respectively (same gel is cropped for space reasons). GST or GST-TACC3 was phosphorylated with Aurora-A before incubation
with MBP-TACC3 which was unphosphorylated or treated with Aurora-A. (d) Interaction between MBP-TACC3(500–838) and GST-TACC3(500–838), as in

with Aurora-A kinase.

 however it is only in mitosis where the consequences of the
interaction become obvious. Second, we could mimic the
effect of FT3 expression by expressing a TACC domain
fused to a different transmembrane domain (CD8-TACC3).
The degree of mitotic defects is very similar (34% versus
38%) to that observed in FT3-expressing cells. Third, rescue
of mitotic defects in FT3-positive bladder cancer cells
(RT112 and RT4) was possible either by knocking down
FT3 or by low-level overexpression of full-length TACC3.
Rescue was incomplete and this is perhaps due to partial
FT3 knockdown and/or the variability in TACC3 expression
in individual cells upon transient transfection. Together these
results suggest that reduced levels of TACC3 on the mitotic
spindle is the major reason for mitotic and chromosomal
abnormalities observed in FT3-positive cells.
TACC3 is a protein primarily involved in stabilizing kin-
etochore fibres of the mitotic spindle [25]. These fibres are
important for accurate segregation of sister chromatids
during mitosis [26–28]. Mammalian cells are sensitive to
TACC3 levels because it has been shown that either an
increase or a decrease in TACC3 causes mitotic defects and
delays in mitosis [8]. Removal of TACC3 by FT3, or indeed
by synthetic proteins where a TACC domain is localized
away from the spindle, causes mitotic defects. This is likely
to be due to a reduction in kinetochore fibre stability
[10,17]. Reduced kinetochore fibre stabilization results in a
slower progression through mitosis [8,15,17]. The removal
of endogenous TACC3 from the spindle by FT3 in this
paper did not change the rate of progression through mitosis.
This is likely to be because the removal of TACC3 from spin-
dles is not as extensive with FT3 expression as it is with
TACC3 RNAi. A direct comparison of the two methods per-
formed here suggests that this is indeed the case.
We also looked at the role of constitutive FGFR3 signal-
ling from FT3 in mitotic defects. We found only a minor
change in the number of normal mitoses and no alteration
of TACC3 levels at the mitotic spindle. This suggests to us
that there is little contribution of altered FGFR3 signalling
to mitotic defects observed in FT3-positive cancer cells.
Work from other groups has highlighted the role of constitu-
tive FGFR3 signalling in FT3-positive cells [3,29]. The present
work suggests that this signalling is likely to influence onco-
genesis via mechanisms other than defective chromosome
segregation. The importance of signalling versus mitotic
mechanisms is evident from work on other oncogenic
FGFR3 alterations where a mitotic partner is not evident,
e.g. FGFR3(S249C) or FGFR3-BAIAP2L1 [30].
During our work, we noticed that FT3 exists in two forms
when cells grow asynchronously. However, during mitosis
only the faster migrating form was visible (figure 5a). FT3
exists in glycosylated and deglycosylated forms in RT112
cells [31]. It is possible that, during entry into mitosis, FT3

Figure 6. Model to explain how FGFR3–TACC3 contributes to oncogenesis. (a) FGFR3 is normally involved in signalling via MAPK and PI3K signalling cascade. Upon
fusion with TACC3, FGFR3–TACC3 activates the MAPK pathway constitutively, with possible activation of PI3K. Previous work has described how either a loss or
overexpression of TACC3 causes mitotic defects. (b) Work in this paper shows that FGFR3–TACC3 binds and recruits TACC3 away from the spindle. In addition to
constitutive signalling, cells have defects in mitosis which together are likely to contribute to oncogenesis.

 becomes deglycosylated or that the glycosylated form is
degraded. The significance of this alteration during mitosis
is not known but is interesting for future study.
In this paper, we have shown a TACC3-specific role of
FT3 in inducing mitotic defects in bladder cancer cells. The
mechanism we describe is general and is likely to translate
to other FT3-positive cancer types. This mitotic mechanism
occurs simultaneously with constitutive FGFR3–TACC3 sig-
nalling. These two mechanisms are likely to work hand-in-
hand during oncogenesis, but their relative contributions
are uncertain. We note that therapies that inhibit FGFR3 sig-
nalling in FT3-positive cancers would not tackle the reduction
of TACC3 levels at the mitotic spindle, and mitotic defects
will still be present in these cells. The consequences of this
for tumour progression are unclear, but development of a
therapeutic agent that inhibits signalling and prevents
TACC3 removal is most likely to bring FT3-positive cells
back to a normal state.
5. Material and methods
5.1. Cell culture
HeLa cells (HPA/ECACC #93021013) were maintained in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium plus 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 100 U ml21 penicillin/streptomycin (pen/
strep) at 378C and 5% CO2. RT112 cells (CLS, 300324) were
maintained in RPM1 1640 medium supplemented with
2 mM L-glutamine and 10% FBS and 100 U ml21 pen/strep
at 378C and 5% CO2. RT4 cells (CLS, 300326-SF) were main-
tained in EMEM medium supplemented with L-glutamine,

growth medium kit 2 (Promocell) containing 90 ml of 0.5 M
CaCl2, puromycin (1 mg ml21) and 100 U ml21 pen/strep at
378C and 5% CO2. For HeLa, plasmid DNA transfection
was done by GeneJuice (MerckMillipore, UK), plasmid
DNA or siRNA transfection was done either by Lipofecta-
mine 2000 (Life Technologies, UK) in the case of RT112, or
by electroporation method (NEON transfection system, Invi-
trogen, Life Technologies, UK) in the case of RT4 and TERT-B
cells, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with the
following electroporation parameters (for RT4: pulse voltage
1100 V, pulse width 30 ms and pulse number 1 pulse; for
TERT-B: pulse voltage 1200 V, pulse width 30 ms and pulse
number 1 pulse).
5.2. Molecular biology
To construct FT3(649–838)-GFP, FGFR3 (1–758 aa) and TACC3
(649–838 aa) were each amplified by PCR and ligated to
pEGFP-N1 (for GFP) using Gibson assembly. FT3(649–838)-
mCherry was constructed by digesting FT3(649–838)-GFP
with BamHI and AgeI and subcloned into pmCherry-N1. To
express GFP or GFP-TACC3 under the TACC3 promoter, the
endogenous promoter sequence for TACC3 was synthesized
by GeneArt, digested with AseI and NheI and subcloned into
either pEGFP-N1 or GFP-TACC3 plasmid. Details of pTACC3
are given in the electronic supplementary material. CD8-
TACC3-mCherry was constructed by amplifying TACC3
(649–838 aa) by PCR, digesting with BamHI and AgeI and clon-
ing into CD8-mCherry, available from previous work [32].
Details of siRNA sequences to specifically knockdown FT3
fusions in RT112 or RT4 cells are given in the electronic sup-
plementary material. Sequences of siRNAs against GL2
(control) and TACC3 are as described previously [33].
5.3. Immunofluorescence and microscopy
For measuring endogenous TACC3 levels on the mitotic spin-
dle, cells were transfected with respective plasmid DNA or
siRNA,
fixed
with
PTEMF,
permeabilized
with
0.1%
Triton X-100, blocked with 1% BSA, stained with mouse
anti-TACC3 and rabbit anti-tubulin and visualized by anti-

secondary
antibodies, respectively. For visualization of TACC3 localiz-
ation in HeLa, cells were transfected with GFP or FT3-GFP
and stained with rabbit anti-TACC3, and for FT3 localization
cells were stained with rabbit anti-tubulin or rabbit anti-peri-
centrin. Clathrin was stained using a similar protocol. For
ch-TOG, methanol fixation was used, BSA for blocking and
a GFP/A488 was included to boost the GFP signal. All anti-
bodies used in the paper are summarized in the electronic
supplementary material.
For live-cell imaging, RT112 or RT4 cells (1 � 105 cells per
well, 12-well plate) were transfected with respective siRNAs
together with H2B-mCherry, and after 48–67 h cells were
imaged on a Nikon Ti epifluorescence microscope with 40�
ELWD objective (0.6 NA) and a CoolSnap Myo camera
(Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) for 12 h using NIS ELEMENTS AR
software. H2B-mCherry was imaged once every 3 or 4 min.
Cells were kept at 378C in the presence of CO2-free
medium. For experiments using GFP-TACC3 rescue or
CD8-TACC3 expression, 1 � 105 cells were transfected with
H2B-mCherry and GFP-TACC3 or H2B-GFP and CD8-
TACC3-mCherry. After 24 h, cells were synchronized at S-
phase by double thymidine block, released and mitotic pro-
gression imaging was carried out as described above. HeLa
cells were used for this experiment because TERT-B cells
were difficult to transfect and to image for long periods.
For PD173074 experiments, cells (1 � 105 cells) were trans-
fected with H2B-mCherry. Cells were synchronized and
imaged as earlier. Cells were kept at 378C in the presence
CO2-free medium containing DMSO or PD173074 (500 nM).
To avoid light-induced cell damage, intensity and exposure
of light were kept to a minimum.
5.4. Biochemistry
RT112 cells were seeded into 15 cm dishes at a density of
1 � 106. For mitotic extracts, after 24 h, cells were first
synchronized at S-phase with thymidine (2 mM final). After
17 h, cells were washed, released into fresh medium for
6–7 h before being treated with nocodazole (1 mg ml21).
Cells were kept in the presence of nocodazole for 16 h,
washed and released into fresh medium. After 35–40 min,
cells were collected, washed with PBS and lysed in lysis
buffer (20 mM Tris–Cl pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40,
5 mM
Na
orthovanadate,
10 mM
b-glycerophosphate,
50 mM NaF, 5 mM tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 100 nM oka-
daic acid, 15 mg ml21 DNaseI) containing 1 mM PMSF and
protease inhibitor cocktail. Cell extract was kept on ice for
30 min before centrifugation at 14 000 r.p.m. for 15 min.

 Clear supernatant was collected and protein concentration
was measured by Bradford assay. For immunoprecipitation,
1 mg of whole-cell extract was precleared using protein A
agarose beads pre-equilibrated in wash buffer (described
below), supernatant was collected, 10 mg of agarose-conju-
gated anti-TACC3 (sc22773) was added and kept at 48C for
2 h with rotation. Beads were collected by centrifugation
and washed three times with wash buffer (20 mM Tris–Cl
pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40 and protease inhibitor
cocktail). The beads were resuspended in 1� SDS sample
buffer, heated at 958C for 5 min and run on 7% SDS-PAGE
gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane,
blocked in 5% skimmed milk in 1� TBS-Tween 20 and
probed with either anti-FGFR3 for detection of FT3 or anti-
TACC3 (H300, sc22773) for TACC3 detection. For asynchro-
nous culture, 1 � 106 cells (either RT112 or TERT-B) were
seeded onto 15 cm dishes, then after 48 h cell extracts were
made and the immunoprecipitation experiment was carried
out as described above.
For PD173074-mediated FGFR3 inhibition, 1 � 105 RT112
cells were seeded on 12-well plates. The following day, cells
were treated with either DMSO or 500 nM PD173074. Cells
were collected, and lysed in RIPA buffer. Total protein con-
centration was measured by the Bradford method. Whole-
cell extract was prepared, and equal amounts of protein
taken, heated at 958C for 5 min and run on a 4–15% gradient
gel. Western blotting was carried out using anti-pERK1/2 or
anti-ERK1/2.
For measurement of TACC3 levels expressed either from
the CMV or TACC3 promoter, RT112 cells were transfected
and the following day whole-cell extracts were prepared
using RIPA buffer. Equal amounts of protein were taken,
heated at 958C for 5 min and run on a 4–15% gradient gel.
Western blotting was carried out using anti-GFP.
For assessment of knockdown, cells were transfected with
siRNAs, then after 48–72 h cells were collected, whole-cell
extracts made, heated at 958C for 5 min and run on a 7 or
8% SDS-PAGE, with mouse anti-FGFR3 and mouse anti-
tubulin used for detection of FT3 and a-tubulin, respectively.
To
test
the
dimerization/multimerization
between
TACC3, binding experiments were carried out as previously
described [11]. Briefly, GST-TACC3-His6 and MBP-TACC3-
His6 proteins were purified using glutathione sepharose 4B
and amylose resin, respectively. For in vitro interaction
studies, equal amounts (50 mg) of GST- and MBP-fused pro-
teins were mixed in reaction buffer I (50 mM Tris–Cl pH
7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EGTA). The mixture was incu-
bated with a 50% slurry of glutathione sepharose 4B beads
(pre-equilibrated in NET-2 buffer (50 mM Tris–Cl, pH 7.5,
150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40 substitute)) and left overnight at
48C with rotation. Next day, beads were collected by spinning
down at 1000g for 2 min at 48C and washed four times with
NET-2 buffer. Beads were then resuspended in 30 ml of 1�
Laemmli buffer, denatured at 958C and analysed by western
blotting after running on 8% SDS-PAGE. Protein samples
were also analysed by staining SDS-PAGE gels with Coomas-
sie brilliant blue. All antibodies used in this study are listed in
the electronic supplementary material.
5.5. Data analysis
TACC3 intensity on the mitotic spindle was measured by
taking the average of four small regions of interest on the
spindle and normalizing to the control value. Mitotic pro-
gression was monitored by manual annotation of frames
where mitotic stage transitions occurred. An automated pro-
cedure
read
in
these
values
and
plotted
cumulative
histograms in IGORPRO 7 (Wavemetrics). The code used is
available at https://github.com/quantixed/PaperCode. Stat-
istical tests were done in IGORPRO using one-way ANOVA
with Tukey’s post hoc test for more than two experimental
groups and Student’s t-test with Welch’s correction for two
experimental groups. Binomial data used the x2 test. All
figures were made in FIJI, IGORPRO and ILLUSTRATOR.
