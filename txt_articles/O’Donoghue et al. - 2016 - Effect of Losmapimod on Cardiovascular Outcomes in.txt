IMPORTANCE p38 Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)–stimulated inflammation is
implicated in atherogenesis, plaque destabilization, and maladaptive processes in myocardial
infarction (MI). Pilot data in a phase 2 trial in non–ST elevation MI indicated that the
p38 MAPK inhibitor losmapimod attenuates inflammation and may improve outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of losmapimod on cardiovascular outcomes in
patients hospitalized with an acute myocardial infarction.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS LATITUDE-TIMI 60, a randomized, placebo-controlled,
double-blind, parallel-group trial conducted at 322 sites in 34 countries from June 3, 2014,
until December 8, 2015. Part A consisted of a leading cohort (n = 3503) to provide an initial
assessment of safety and exploratory efficacy before considering progression to part B
(approximately 22 000 patients). Patients were considered potentially eligible for enrollment
if they had been hospitalized with an acute MI and had at least 1 additional predictor of
cardiovascular risk.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to either twice-daily losmapimod (7.5 mg;
n = 1738) or matching placebo (n = 1765) on a background of guideline-recommended
therapy. Patients were treated for 12 weeks and followed up for an additional 12 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was the composite of cardiovascular
death, MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent coronary revascularization with the
principal analysis specified at week 12.
RESULTS In part A, among the 3503 patients randomized (median age, 66 years; 1036
[29.6%] were women), 99.1% had complete ascertainment for the primary outcome.
The primary end point occurred by 12 weeks in 123 patients treated with placebo (7.0%) and
139 patients treated with losmapimod (8.1%; hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.91-1.47; P = .24).
The on-treatment rates of serious adverse events were 16.0% with losmapimod and 14.2%
with placebo.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with acute MI, use of losmapimod compared
with placebo did not reduce the risk of major ischemic cardiovascular events. The results of
this exploratory efficacy study did not justify proceeding to a larger efficacy trial in the
existing patient population.

T
he p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
is an intracellular kinase that is expressed in multiple
cells, including endothelial cells, myocytes, and
macrophages,1 and participates in numerous adaptive and
maladaptive biological processes, including inflammation, as
well as cellular migration, growth, and death.2 The enzyme is
activated in the cardio-
vascular system by a vari-
ety of stressors, including
oxidized low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol,
hypertension, ischemia,
and volume overload.1,3
Activation of p38 MAPK leads to amplification of the inflam-
matory cascade through enhanced production of multiple
cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukins 1 and
6, metalloproteinases, and cyclooxygenase 2.4 MAPK-
mediated inflammatory amplification has been implicated in
atherogenesis, plaque destabilization, and detrimental pro-
cesses in infarction and wound healing.2,5
Losmapimod is a selective, reversible, competitive inhibi-
tor of p38 MAPK with onset as early as 30 minutes after oral
dosing. In a randomized trial of 526 patients hospitalized with
non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), losmapi-
mod, administered prior to percutaneous coronary interven-
tion (PCI), attenuated the acute increase in markers of inflam-
mation (C-reactive protein and interleukin 6) at 72 hours.
However, the effects were no longer significant at 12 weeks and
the drug did not reduce periprocedural myonecrosis. Al-
though the trial was not powered for clinical efficacy, the in-
cidence of death, MI, recurrent ischemia, stroke, or heart fail-
ure was lower in patients treated with losmapimod, although
the difference was not statistically significant (hazard ratio
[HR], 0.82; 95% CI, 0.49-1.37).6 Furthermore, in a subgroup
of patients who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance
imaging, losmapimod improved left ventricular function con-
sistent with reduced adverse ventricular remodeling.
Therefore, we hypothesized that losmapimod may miti-
gate a number of complications that occur in patients with
acute MI.7 The Losmapimod to Inhibit p38 MAP Kinase as a
Therapeutic Target and Modify Outcomes After an Acute Coro-
nary Syndrome (LATITUDE)–TIMI 60 trial was a multina-
tional phase 3 trial designed to test the efficacy and safety of
the p38 MAPK inhibitor losmapimod when added to existing
care for patients with acute MI, both NSTEMI and STEMI.
Methods
The study design has been described,7 and the trial protocol
is provided in Supplement 2. In brief, the trial was a random-
ized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, mul-
tinational trial that was planned to occur in 2 major parts. The
trial was conducted at 322 sites in 34 countries (eAppendix in
Supplement 1). In the first stage of the trial (part A), a leading
cohort of patients was enrolled to provide an initial assess-
ment of safety and exploratory efficacy before progressing to
the main cohort (part B). Part B was to be event driven, with
approximately 22 000 patients randomized in the main co-
hort to provide the primary assessment of the efficacy of los-
mapimod. By design, on completion of the treatment phase
of part A, a selected group of individuals involved in the trial
leadership from the TIMI Study Group and the sponsor re-
viewed unblinded summary data from part A and the deci-
sion was made that the data did not support proceeding to
part B. This article reports the final results of part A. The de-
cision to proceed to part B was planned to be multifaceted and
based in part on the probability of demonstrating a statisti-
cally significant reduction in cardiovascular events in part B,
given the totality of the observed data in part A.
The protocol was approved by the relevant institutional
review boards or ethics committees, and all participants gave
written informed consent.
Study Population
Patients were considered eligible for enrollment if they were
aged 35 years or older; had been hospitalized with a pre-
sumed spontaneous (type 1) MI, including NSTEMI within 24
hours of ischemic symptoms or STEMI within 12 hours of on-
set; and had at least 1 additional predictor of cardiovascular
risk.7 Study drug was to be administered as early as possible
during hospitalization and prior to coronary revasculariza-
tion or reperfusion. Relevant exclusion criteria at study entry
included clinical instability, known acute or chronic liver dis-
ease, current life-threatening or opportunistic infection, se-
vere renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate
<30 mL/min/1.73 m2), or New York Heart Association class III
or IV or Killip class III or IV heart failure at randomization.
Study Procedures
After providing informed consent, eligible patients were ran-
domly assigned at the site level in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by the
qualifying type of MI (NSTEMI or STEMI), through a central
computerized system to receive either losmapimod (7.5 mg
orally twice daily) or matching placebo for 12 weeks (Figure 1).
Each patient was then to be followed up for an additional 12
weeks, for a total study participation of 24 weeks. Any pa-
tient who discontinued study drug prematurely was still fol-
lowed up for outcomes and included in efficacy analyses ac-
cording to the intention-to-treat principle. Close adherence to
localprofessionalsocietyguidelinesforstandard-of-carethera-
pies in acute coronary syndrome was emphasized through-
out study conduct. Patient race was self-reported and cap-
tured in the electronic case-report form by site personnel to
assess homogeneity of drug response.
End Points
The primary end point was major adverse cardiovascular
events, defined as the composite of cardiovascular death,
MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent coronary
artery revascularization. The principal secondary end point
was the composite of cardiovascular death or MI. Additional
cardiovascular outcomes of heart failure, stroke, and
unplanned coronary revascularization were also assessed. A
complete list of secondary outcomes is included in the

Anindependentandblindedclinicaleventscommitteethat
was designed and implemented by the TIMI Study Group ad-
judicated all reported deaths, cardiac ischemic events, cere-
brovascular events, stent thrombosis, and hospitalizations for
heart failure according to prespecified definitions.7
Biomarkers
As a prespecified exploratory analysis, high-sensitivity
C-reactive protein (hs-CRP; Olympus Latex) was to be mea-
sured in all participants at randomization, week 4, week 12,
and week 24. In addition, in a subset of participants, serial
assessment was also performed for hs-CRP (n = 631) at 48
hours, week 13, and week 18 and N-terminal pro–brain natri-
uretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP; n = 1199; Roche Diagnostics) at
week 4, week 12, and week 24.
Statistical Analysis
It was anticipated that approximately 3500 patients in part
A would yield approximately 200 to 250 primary end points
to be used to judge whether to continue to part B, the design
of which has been detailed previously.7 The sample size for
part A was in part determined using simulation techniques
to model the number of events at which the volatility in the
effect estimate converged with modest subsequent gain. A
sample size of 3500 participants was needed to accrue the
target number of primary end points, based on a projected
12-week event rate of 7.0% in the placebo group and a 16%
relative risk reduction in the losmapimod group.
As outlined in the reporting and analysis plan (Sup-
plement 2), efficacy analyses included all randomized par-
ticipants, with the exception of patients at a single site
where data integrity was compromised, leading to their
exclusion from all efficacy and safety analyses (n = 14
patients). Sensitivity analyses were performed including
these 14 participants without any meaningful change in the
results. Safety analyses were conducted among patients
who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The primary
analysis was time to event using a log-rank test stratified by
the type of qualifying MI (NSTEMI vs STEMI). Cumulative
event rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method
at 12 weeks (day 84) for the primary analyses and then
through full follow-up through 24 weeks. Estimated HRs
and 95% confidence intervals were obtained using a Cox
proportional hazards regression model with the same strati-
fication factor. The Cox proportional hazards assumption
was reviewed and deemed to be met. Analyses were
assessed using a 2-sided significance threshold of P<.05,
including secondary end points and subgroup interactions.
All analyses of secondary end points and interactions
should be interpreted as exploratory. All statistical analyses
were performed with SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc) and
R software (http://www.r-project.org).

Results
From June 3, 2014, until May 15, 2015, a total of 3503 partici-
pants were enrolled in part A of the trial. During the course of
the study, a total of 3490 patients (99.6%) received at least 1
dose of study drug. Overall, 99.1% of participants had com-
pleteascertainmentfortheprimaryoutcome,andthefinaldis-
position of all study participants is summarized in Figure 1.
Baseline characteristics were well balanced between treat-
ment groups (Table 1). The median age of enrolled partici-
pants was 66 years and 29.4% were women. The qualifying MI
was a STEMI in 24.8%. The median time from symptom on-
set to randomization was 3.8 hours (interquartile range [IQR],
2.5-6.6 hours) for STEMI and 20.3 hours (IQR, 13.0-27.7 hours)
for NSTEMI. For management of the qualifying event, 94.9%
ofpatientswithNSTEMIunderwentcardiaccatheterizationand
61.8% underwent coronary revascularization. In patients with
STEMI, 97.7% of patients underwent cardiac catheterization

end points is reported in Table 2 and did not reveal any effect
of losmapimod. Results were similar at week 24 in the overall
cohort, with the primary end point having occurred in 10.3%
of patients allocated to losmapimod and 9.7% allocated to pla-
cebo (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.9-1.38).
Exploratoryanalysesoftheeffectoflosmapimodwereper-
formed in prespecified subgroups. There was no statistically
significant heterogeneity at 12 weeks for the primary out-
come of cardiovascular death, MI, or severe recurrent ische-
mia leading to urgent revascularization within any of the pre-
specified subgroups (Figure 3).
Biomarkers
Biomarker concentrations were assessed as a prespecified ex-
ploratory outcome. Losmapimod reduced levels of the inflam-
matory biomarker hs-CRP at 4 weeks (ratio of the mean for
losmapimod compared with placebo, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62-
0.91; P=.004 based on the geometric least square means) and
at the end of the treatment period at 12 weeks (ratio of means,
0.73; 95% CI, 0.61-0.87; P < .001). In a planned subset of pa-
tients with testing at 48 hours after the initial dose during the
index hospitalization, losmapimod attenuated the acute in-
hospitalincreaseinhs-CRP(Figure4).N-terminalpro-BNPcon-
centration was also significantly reduced at 4 weeks and 12
weeksinpatientstreatedwithlosmapimodcomparedwithpla-
cebo (Figure 4).
Safety
The incidence of any on-treatment serious adverse event was
16.0% for patients treated with losmapimod and 14.2% for pa-
tients treated with placebo (Table 3). Study drug was prema-
turely permanently discontinued in 15.5% of patients random-
ized to losmapimod and 13.7% of patients randomized to
placebo. The incidence of any adverse event leading to per-
manent premature drug discontinuation was 4.4% in the los-
mapimod group and 3.9% in the placebo group. The inci-
dence of liver enzyme abnormalities was similar by treatment
group, although a trend toward a higher incidence of mildly
elevatedhepatictransaminases(>3timestheupperlimitofnor-
mal) was observed for patients treated with losmapimod. The
incidence of infections, including serious infections, was simi-
lar between treatment groups (Table 3).

Discussion
In this trial, losmapimod did not reduce the risk of recurrent
majoradversecardiovasculareventsthrough12weeksoftreat-
mentinpatientshospitalizedwithacuteMI.Furthermore,there
was no evidence that losmapimod reduced the incidence of
any secondary outcomes including all-cause mortality. There-
fore, our findings do not support a strategy of p38 MAPK in-
hibition with losmapimod in patients hospitalized with MI.
Prior to the current trial, both preclinical and early clini-
cal evidence supported the concept that p38 MAPK inhibi-
tion could reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events.1,7
Specifically,p38MAPKhasbeenimplicatedinpreclinicalmod-
els to contribute to cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction in postin-
farction remodeling and heart failure,8,9 in addition to myo-
cytedeathduringmyocardialischemia.10,11Inpatientsenrolled
in the phase 2 trial in MI, losmapimod significantly improved
left ventricular ejection fraction, reduced left ventricular end-
diastolic and end-systolic volume, and lowered NT-pro-BNP
concentration at 12 weeks.6 p38 MAPK inhibition has been
shown to reduce vascular inflammation as assessed by cellu-
lar uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on positron emis-
sion tomography–computed tomography, improve vascular
function, and attenuate the periprocedural increase in
C-reactiveproteininpatientsundergoingelectiveorurgentPCI,
with a numerically lower number of cardiovascular events that
did not achieve statistical significance in a prior phase 2
trial.6,12,13 In LATITUDE-TIMI 60, losmapimod reduced peri-
procedurallevelsoftheinflammatorymarkerhs-CRPinabroad
spectrum of patients with acute MI and significantly reduced
NT-pro-BNPconcentration;however,thisdidnottranslateinto
clinical benefit.
Because inflammation is believed to play a key role in ath-
erogenesis, there remains intense interest to identify an anti-
inflammatory therapeutic that will reduce the risk of cardio-
vascularevents.14,15However,becauseinflammationactsalong
multiple redundant and interconnected pathways, the iden-
tificationofanappropriatetargetmaybedifficult,anditischal-
lenging to predict clinical efficacy prior to phase 3 testing.16,17
As such, the current phase 3 trial incorporated a multistage de-
sign that allowed preliminary insight into drug efficacy prior
to expansion into the full study cohort of more than 22 000
patients. By incorporating multiple stages into a single phase
3 trial, efficiency is streamlined; thus, this type of adaptive
study design may potentially serve as a model for future trials.
Ongoing clinical trials are currently evaluating additional anti-
inflammatorytherapeuticsinpatientswithatherosclerosisand
will provide further insight into pathways that contribute to
vascular disease.15
Limitations to the current study warrant consideration.
Part A was designed to provide an exploratory assessment of
efficacy and was not designed with statistical power for indi-
vidual end points. Nonetheless, given the observed effect
estimates, the posterior probability of a meaningful effect of
losmapimod in the broad population studied is extremely
low. Specifically, given the observed result in part A, the
probability of a treatment effect of 15% or more being
observed in the overall MI population planned to be studied
in part B was less than 1%. Given this primary result, any sig-
nals toward potential efficacy in subgroups should be consid-
ered only hypothesis generating. Only a single dosage of
study drug was selected for study and, thus, one cannot pre-
clude the possibility that alternate dosages would have led to
differing results. However, surrogate pharmacodynamic data
did not suggest greater anti-inflammatory effects at higher
dosages and, therefore, the current dosage was selected on
the perceived balance of potential efficacy and tolerability. As
well, the treatment course was limited in duration and, there-
fore, the results do not address the efficacy of longer-term
anti-inflammatory therapy.
Conclusions
Among patients with acute MI, use of losmapimod compared
with placebo did not reduce the risk of major ischemic cardio-
vascular events. The results of this exploratory efficacy study
did not justify proceeding to a larger efficacy trial in the ex-
isting patient population.
