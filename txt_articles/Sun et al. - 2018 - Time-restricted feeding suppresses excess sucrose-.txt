Abstract
The etiology of metabolic syndrome involves several complicated factors. One of the main
factors contributing to metabolic syndrome has been proposed to be excessive intake of
sucrose, which disturbs hepatic lipid metabolism, resulting in fatty liver. However, the mech-
anism by which sucrose induces fatty liver remains to be elucidated. Considering feeding
behavior important for metabolism, we investigated whether time-restricted feeding of high
sucrose diet (HSD), only in the active phase (the dark phase of the daily light/dark cycle),
would ameliorate adverse effects of sucrose on lipid homeostasis in rats. Male Wistar rats,
fed either an ad libitum (ad lib.) or time-restricted control starch diet (CD) or HSD were inves-
tigated. Rats fed ad lib. (CD and HSD) completed approximately 20% of food intake in the
daytime. Time-restricted feeding did not significantly suppress total food intake of rats. How-
ever, time-restricted feeding of HSD significantly suppressed the increased plasma triglycer-
ide levels. Moreover, time-restricted feeding also ameliorated HSD-induced liver lipid
accumulation, whereas circadian oscillations of liver clock gene or transcriptional factor
gene expression for lipid metabolism were not altered significantly. These results demon-
strated that restricting sucrose intake only during the active phase in rats ameliorates the
abnormal lipid metabolism caused by excess sucrose intake.
Introduction
Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of symptoms, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyper-
lipidemia, and central obesity, without internationally agreed definition[1]. And nowadays it is
a global problem threatening human health. The etiology of metabolic syndrome is quite com-
plicated owing to the involvement of both genetic and environmental factors. Among the envi-
ronmental factors, diet plays a significant role in the development of metabolic syndrome [2].
Excessive energy from a high-fat diet was considered to be the main factor of metabolic syn-
drome. Moreover, excess sucrose intake has also been recognized as a culprit recently [3].

 Fructose, a monosaccharide of sucrose hydrolysis, was concluded to play an important role in
the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver and hyperlipidemia
[4,5]. As reported, glucose is metabolized through the glycolysis pathway, which is controlled
by several factors such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and citrate [6]. Moreover, the high
Michaelis constant (Km) of glucokinase, a rate-limiting enzyme regulated by insulin, contrib-
utes to the regulation of glucose metabolism [7]. Remarkably distinct from this, fructokinase,
the first enzyme metabolizing fructose, has a low Km [8]. This results in a series of rapid sub-
strates for the hepatic de novo lipogenesis [9,10]. However, based on the current studies that
primarily focus on the flow of substrates from fructose into fatty acid synthesis, the relation-
ship between sucrose and metabolic syndrome remains controversial.
Further studies are required to uncover the mechanism of how sucrose could contribute to
the onset of metabolic syndrome at the molecular level. At present, efficient prevention or
amelioration methods for sucrose-induced metabolic syndrome are required. We had previ-
ously demonstrated that a suppressed feeding schedule, with high-cholesterol diets every 6 hr,
results in rats developing hypercholesterolemia and a disturbed liver clock [11]. Disruption of
circadian oscillations in Clock mutant mice leads to robust attenuation of feeding rhythm and
metabolic syndrome [12]. Moreover, time-restricted feeding of a high-fat diet for 8 hr per day
in mice improved metabolic rhythm and imparted protection from metabolic diseases, thereby
highlighting the importance of both nutrient state and feeding pattern in metabolic homeosta-
sis [13]. Also, the beneficial effects of time-restricted feeding regimen in different diet condi-
tions, including high-fat, high-fructose, and high-fat-plus-high-fructose diets, have been
verified in mouse models [14].
Time-restricted feeding regimen in Zucker rat models of obesity, with normal chow diet,
succeeded to reduce body weight gain [15]. Here, in order to evaluate the effects of time-
restricted feeding on amelioration of sucrose-induced metabolic syndrome in genetically nor-
mal rats, such as abnormal lipid metabolism, we established a feeding schedule by restricting
high sucrose diet (HSD) to the 12 hr long active phase of male Wistar rats. Rats may be more
appropriate animal models than mice to investigate metabolic diseases of humans, due to their
approximately 10-times larger body size and more stable energy metabolism statuses com-
pared to that in mice. We found that time-restricted feeding of HSD suppressed the excess
sucrose-induced lipid accumulation effectively both in blood and liver, when compared with
rats fed HSD ad lib., without significantly altering the circadian oscillations of clock gene
expression in liver.
Materials and methods
Animals, feeding schedule, and diets
The rodent study was approved by and performed according to the guidelines of the Animal
Research Committee of the Center for Animal Research and Education, Nagoya University
(Permit Number: 2015052901). All surgeries were performed under isoflurane anesthesia, and
all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Five-week-old Wistar male rats (Japan SLC,
Japan), weighing about 90g each, were independently housed under a 12 hr light: 12 hr dark
cycle (lights on 0800–2000) at a temperature of 23±1˚C; free access to water was provided
throughout the experiment. They were allowed to adapt to the housing conditions for 3 d fol-
lowing which temperature data loggers (KN laboratories, Osaka, Japan) were implanted into
the intraperitoneal cavity. Body weight of rats was measured at ZT2 (Zeitgeber time, ZT0 is
defined as the point of lights on) everyday. After 3 d, they were divided into four groups, with
both equivalent initial body weights and plasma triglyceride concentrations. Rats were fed the
experimental diets for four weeks. The compositions of diets are shown in Table 1. They were

 fed control starch diet (CD) or high sucrose diet (HSD) either with ad lib. (named as group
CDA or HSDA, respectively) or time-restricted (named as group CDR or HSDR, respectively)
access to diets (see Fig 1). Under time-restricted feeding regimen, rats were allowed to access
the diets during the active phase (dark period) between ZT12 and ZT24. Rats were kept in
wire-bottom cages individually to avoid coprophagy and were fed powder diets from contain-
ers. During non-feeding phases, the containers were moved out of the cages to ensure no food
left. Blood sampling from rat caudal vein, using heparin-treated capillaries, was performed at
ZT5 after 4 hr fasting on days 0 (the start of experimental diets), 1, 3, 7, 14, and 24. Plasma was
prepared by centrifuging samples at 1500 × g (4˚C) for 10 min; blood supernatant fraction col-
lected with heparin treatment (as mentioned above) was named as plasma. Rats were sacrificed
by decapitation without anesthesia at ZT2, ZT8, ZT14, ZT18, and ZT22 from day 28 to day 29.
When rats were sacrificed at night (ZT14, 18, and 22), they were exposed to light only at the
moment of decapitation, to minimize the influence of light. Blood was collected without hepa-
rin-treatment and serum was prepared by centrifuging samples at 1500 × g (4˚C) for 10 min.
Livers and epididymal adipose tissues were excised and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen
and stored at -80˚C until further analysis.
Biochemical analysis
The blood triglyceride, cholesterol, glucose, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) and bile acid con-
centrations were measured using commercial kits (triglyceride E-test, T-cholesterol E-test, glu-
cose CII-test, NEFA-C test and TBA-test; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). The
insulin and corticosterone levels were determined using ELISA kits (rat insulin ELISA kit,
Morinaga Institute of Biological Science, Yokohama, Japan; corticosterone ELISA kit, Enzo
life sciences, NY).

 About 2.5 g of liver was homogenized and lipids extracted, following the method described
by Folch et al. [16]. Total lipids in the liver were determined gravimetrically. The concentra-
tions of hepatic triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipid in the extracts were measured
using commercial kits (phospholipids C-test: Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan).
Gene expression analysis
Total RNA was extracted from 500 mg liver tissue of each rat, following the method of Chomc-
zynski and Sacchi [17]. RNA quality was confirmed by northern blotting. Deoxyribonuclease
(DNase) treatment was performed with ribonuclease (RNase)-free DNase (Promega, Wiscon-
sin) and RNase inhibitor (Takara Bio, Japan). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized
with 2 μg DNase-treated RNA by reverse transcription kit (High capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit,
Applied Biosystems, CA). The cDNA was used to determine messenger RNA (mRNA) levels
by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) analysis. The APOE
mRNA level was not affected by any treatment in this study and was used as the normalization
standard. Sequences of the primer sets used are shown in S1 Table.
Body temperature analysis
Rat body temperatures were recorded every 10 min from day 0 to the end of the experiment.
Rh Manager program (KN laboratories, Osaka, Japan) was used to analyze body temperature
variations. Although variations were monitored every 10 min,, those every 90 min were
depicted in results.
Statistics
At the end of the experiment, samples were collected throughout the day to evaluate the diur-
nal changes of serum parameters and hepatic gene expressions. Data displayed in tables and
figures represent mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). Body weight gain, food intake, liver
weight, epididymal adipose tissue weight, liver lipids, serum parameters, and real-time PCR
results were analyzed with two-way ANOVA. Plasma parameters were analyzed with two-way
repeated measures ANOVA. For body temperature variations, two-way repeated measures
ANOVA was followed by JTK_CYCLE analysis [18] to determine the phases and amplitudes
in each rat. Finally, two-way ANOVA was performed to analyze phases and amplitudes among
four groups. Percentage of food intake in light (or dark) period was analyzed by Student’s t
test. Statistical results are presented in Table 2 and S2–S6 Tables. All statistical analyses were
performed with IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 22) and R studio.

 Results
Body weight, food intake, and tissue weights
Body weight gain had no obvious change among CDA, HSDA, and HSDR groups, while
group CDR showed lowered body weight gain (Table 2). Total food intake did not change
among the four groups (Table 2). However an altered day/night food intake ratio between
CDA and HSDA groups was observed. Since rats are nocturnal animals, most of their food
intake is during the dark period (ZT12-ZT24) (Fig 2A). We measured the light-dark period
food intake ratio of groups fed ad lib. (Fig 2). Although HSDA rats showed approximately sim-
ilar food intake as CDA rats (Table 2), the latter completed 24% of their daily food intake dur-
ing the inactive phase (light period), whereas HSDA rats had only 17% at that time (Fig 2B).
This result indicated a potential role of HSD in altering the diurnal feeding rhythm in rats. The

feeding rats (Table 2), hence indicating that the feeding regimen did not change the amount of
food intake. Rats fed an HSD, either ad lib. or as time-restricted, displayed obviously increased
liver weights (Table 2). However, epididymal adipose tissue weights were not different among
the groups (Table 2).
Body temperatures
Body temperature variations, every 90 min, in the final two days of the regimen are displayed
in Fig 3. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA of body temperature were performed between
every two groups (CDA vs. CDR, CDA vs. HSDA, CDR vs. HSDR, HSDA vs. HSDR), and
among 4 groups. However, in any analysis, the results showed only a time-effect, without any
diet-effect, timing-effect or interaction effect (data not shown). Then JTK_CYCLE analysis
determined the phases and amplitudes of each rat under a period of 24 hr (S2 Table). Two-way
ANOVA showed that amplitudes were increased in HSD groups, and phases were delayed by
time-restricted feeding regime (Fig 3, S2 Table). It is notable that time-restricted feeding rats
had delayed elevation of body temperature at the onset of dark period, compared to those in
other groups (Fig 3C).
Blood parameters and hepatic lipids
To determine whether time-restricted feeding of HSD prevents hyperlipidemia in rats, plasma
triglyceride and cholesterol levels were measured. Plasma triglycerides levels were found to be
continuously elevated over the subsequent four weeks in all rats, and were significantly
increased by HSD compared to that in CDR rats (Fig 4A and S3 Table). However, although
time-restricted feeding of HSD (HSDR) clearly attenuated the increase of triglycerides, they
were maintained at higher levels compared to that in CD groups (Fig 4A and S3 Table). The
total cholesterol concentration in HSD groups was elevated, as seen in Fig 4B. While time-
restricted feeding of CD significantly lowered the cholesterol levels, HSDR rats showed no sig-
nificant decrease (Fig 4B and S3 Table). Plasma glucose levels were not influenced by HSD, fed
either ad lib. or in a time-restricted manner, over the entire experimental period (Fig 4C and
S3 Table).
Next, we measured the diurnal variations of insulin, corticosterone, non-esterified fatty
acid (NEFA), and bile acids. Serum was collected at five different time points (blood was col-
lected when rats sacrificed) until the final day. Insulin responds to carbohydrate-lipid metabo-
lism, and glucocorticoid hormone, corticosterone (cortisol in human), which has a role in
circadian oscillations and lipid metabolism [19–22]. Insulin levels were lowered in HSD
groups at ZT18 and ZT22. And at ZT8, CDA rats showed higher insulin level than CDR and
HSDA ones (Fig 5A). Corticosterone showed no significant difference among the groups (Fig
5B). At ZT18, NEFA was increased by HSD and significantly suppressed in HSDR rats (Fig
5C). HSD significantly increased serum bile acid levels in the inactive phase (light period, at
ZT2 and ZT8) (Fig 5D), although time-restricted feeding did not change the HSD-induced
bile acid elevation.
We further measured the hepatic lipid contents to determine whether time-restricted feed-
ing regimen would ameliorate HSD-induced hepatic lipid deposition (Fig 6). Liver total lipids
were significantly increased in HSD-fed rats, and time-restricted feeding suppressed the eleva-
tion (Fig 6A). While hepatic triglycerides and phospholipids were significantly increased by
HSD, time-restricted feeding regimen suppressed the elevation (Fig 6B and 6D); however, it
did not change the HSD-induced increased cholesterol level (Fig 6C). Although hepatic total
lipids were significantly decreased in HSDR rats (Fig 6A), liver weights were not decreased

 (Table 2). This might be due to increase in other components of liver, such as protein, water,
or glycogen. Our results demonstrated that time-restricted feeding of HSD attenuated both
blood and hepatic lipid accumulation, resulting from excess sucrose intake.
Hepatic gene expression
HSD fed ad lib. increased lipid accumulation both in blood and liver, and time-restricted feed-
ing regimen amended hyperlipidemia and fatty liver. In order to evaluate whether time-
restricted feeding of HSD could contribute to improved gene expression signatures, we mea-
sured the expression of hepatic circadian clock genes and lipid metabolism genes that coordi-
nate to maintain lipid homeostasis.
Circadian clock genes, CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles protein kaput), BMAL1
(brain and muscle Arnt-like protein 1), PER (period) 1/2, DEC (differentiated embryo chondro-
cytes) 1/2, CRY (cryptochrome) 1/2, and REV-ERB (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D,
member 1) α/β, also DBP (D site of albumin promoter binding protein) encode important tran-
scription factors involved in the regulation of hepatic circadian rhythms and lipid metabolism
[23]. The expression or oscillation patterns of these genes were not altered among the groups,
except for some minor changes at several time points (Fig 7). Neither HSD nor time-restricted
regimens had an influence on rhythmic expression of genes, including phase, period, and ampli-
tude (Fig 7). There was an increase of DEC1 mRNA at ZT14, induced by HSD and significantly
suppressed by HSDR (Fig 7G). Although insulin had been reported to induce the expression of
DEC1 gene [24], we did not observe any corresponding change of insulin concentration in our
current study (Fig 5A). These results indicate that HSD itself rarely affected the expression of cir-
cadian clock genes and no specific change was observed by time-restricted feeding regimen.
Lipid metabolism is known to be mainly governed by several transcription factors, such as
SREBP (sterol regulatory element binding protein) 1/2, ChREBP (carbohydrate response element
binding protein), LXRα (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 3), and PPARα (nuclear
receptor subfamily 1, group C, member 1) [25,26], which are also reported to show circadian
oscillation [27–29]. We speculated that these transcription factors would also be affected by HSD
and time-restricted feeding, since HSD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was clearly amelio-
rated by time-restricted feeding regimen (Fig 6). However, expression of these transcription fac-
tor genes was hardly affected by HSD or time-restricted feeding, and all the four groups displayed
similar expression patterns (Fig 8). This indicated that attenuation of HSD-induced abnormal
lipid accumulation in liver and blood by time-restricted feeding regimen is probably independent
of the circadian oscillation-transcription factors pathway mediating lipid metabolism.
Discussion
Metabolic syndrome is currently quite prevalent due to the general change in diet from natural
food to processed food containing high fat, sugar, and salt [2]. Excessive sucrose has recently

 been implicated to play an important role in metabolic syndrome [4,5,30]. Excess sucrose has
been reported to induce excessive energy intake-independent obesity and fatty liver in rats,
accelerating features of metabolic syndrome [30]. Obesity-induced insulin resistance that
causes nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common pathogenic characteristic of met-
abolic syndrome [31]. NAFLD plays a critical role in development of metabolic syndrome. In

 our four-week study, HSD dramatically increased lipid accumulation in both blood and liver,
indicating pathogenesis of fatty liver. Time-restricted feeding of HSD, only in the active phase,
suppressed the increased lipid deposition practically, displaying amelioration of the fatty liver
development.
In human and animal studies, sucrose has been reported to decrease insulin sensitivity and
induce insulin resistance [3,32–34], which is a contributing factor to obesity. Metabolic

 syndrome is not always associated with obesity [35,36]; excess sucrose may also contribute to
the development of metabolic syndrome without resulting in obesity [32]. In the present
study, we propose that HSD-cause fatty liver may be independent of obesity, since there was
no increase of body weight in the HSD groups (Table 2). Moreover, we had earlier reported
that insulin is a synchronizer for liver clock [37], and plays an essential role in connecting lipid
metabolism with circadian oscillations. In this study, insulin was only slightly affected by time-
restricted feeding of HSD (Fig 5A). Sucrose has been reported to be addictive, and excessive
intake acts on the brain by affecting hormone (e.g. ghrelin and leptin) regulation [35]. We
hypothesized that sucrose might have potential effects on hormones, such as corticosterone
that we measured in this study. Corticosterone is a glucocorticoid in rodents, higher levels of
which were reported in obese rats [38]. Since some reports showed that corticosterone is asso-
ciated with metabolic diseases [39,40], we speculated that corticosterone would respond to
HSD and time-restricted feeding. However, no significant alteration was observed (Fig 5B).
HSD-induced plasma lipid accumulation showed similar alteration pattern as that in the
liver, and time-restricted feeding of HSD exhibited amelioration effects on dyslipidemia.
Hepatic lipogenesis is known to be directly controlled by the molecular clock [27,29]. Accu-
mulating evidence has indicated that lipid metabolism demonstrates circadian oscillations
mainly achieved from collaborative activities of clock genes and key transcription factors con-
trolling lipid metabolism [27,29,41–43]. Disruption of the circadian rhythm in clock gene
knockout mice has been reported to be another pathogenic factor of metabolic syndrome
[12,44]. Hence, we hypothesized that the connection between circadian oscillation and meta-
bolic state is the mechanism by which time-restricted feeding of HSD suppressed the increased
lipid accumulation. However, the core clock feedback loop was slightly altered by HSD or
time-restricted feeding (Fig 7). Core clock genes, CLOCK and BMAL1, which form heterodi-
mers to activate transcription of clock-controlled genes [45], showed no obvious alteration
(Fig 7A and 7B). In peripheral tissues, clock genes oscillating in the feedback loop dominate
the physiological processes, including glucose and lipid homeostasis, and are sensitive to meta-
bolic signals [27,45]. These clock genes, such as PER1/2, CRY1/2, and REV-ERBα/β, also dis-
played minor changes in our study (Fig 7C–7H). Moreover, downstream of this core clock
loop, transcription factors governing lipid homeostasis (e.g. SREBPs, ChREBP, LXRα, and
PPARα) would be the most important regulators of lipid metabolism genes. We, however, did
not observe any significant variation (Fig 8), despite the obvious suppression of lipid accumu-
lation by time-restricted feeding of HSD.
Of note, there was a delay of body temperature elevation at the onset of dark period (active
phase) in time-restricted feeding rats (Fig 3 and S2 Table). Body temperature usually oscillates
between 37–39˚C in mammals under the control of the hypothalamus; diurnal variations of
body temperatures are associated with energy metabolism oscillations [46]. We speculated that
there would be more energy expenditure in HSDR rats, since time-restricted feeding regimen
attenuated HSD-induced lipid accumulation. However, HSDR rats showed similar amplitudes
of body temperature as HSDA rats. Although there was no significant interaction effect of diet
and timing on the phases (S2 Table), HSDR rats had a tendency to delay the body temperature
elevation at the onset of dark period (Fig 3C). Although this delay did not explain the suppres-
sion of lipid accumulation in blood and liver, the potential role of this delay in lipid metabo-
lism remains to be uncovered.
Fig 7. HSD rarely affected liver clock genes expression. Circadian oscillations of clock genes CLOCK (A), BMAL1 (B), PER1/2 (C
and D), CRY1 (E) REV-ERBα (F), DEC1 (G) and DBP (H) are shown as relative to APOE mRNA level. Values are means ± SEM, n = 4
at each data point. The average value at ZT2 of each gene in CDA rats was defined as 100. Statistical results of two-way ANOVA are
indicated in S5 Table. 0.05 represents for significant changes and NS means not significant.

 It is also notable that rats under ad lib. access to HSD had less food intake during the inac-
tive phase compared to CD rats (Fig 2). Although it is clearly different from the blunted diur-
nal feeding rhythm in mice under high-fat diets [13], HSD-fed rats had more robust feeding
rhythms than CD-fed rats. Since circadian and feeding rhythms work in harmony to entrain
metabolic pathways [11,13,47], the altered feeding rhythm in HSD rats would impact meta-
bolic processes via feeding behavior modulated by the hypothalamus. Hence, feeding behavior
or feeding rhythm would have a potential role in ameliorating HSD-induced hyperlipidemia
in time-restricted feeding rats. Although a robust feeding rhythm was considered better for the
amelioration of metabolic abnormalities [13], the robust feeding behavior induced by HSD
might have a role in disturbing lipid metabolism in rats; however, further research is required
to explain this phenomenon. Although time-restricted feeding of HSD, within active phase of
rats, showed negligible restriction of daily calorie intake, it is important of restriction of food
availability during an appropriate period. This effect is not achieved from the mechanism at a
gene expression level. The changes at protein level may play roles in achieving this effect. The
gut-microbiota system and muscles, connecting absorption, transportation, nutrient utiliza-
tion, and liver lipid metabolism, may be affected by time-restricted feeding regimen.
Excess sucrose intake has been recognized as the main causative factor in metabolic syn-
drome [4,5,30]. Time-restricted feeding regimen of HSD, within active phase, is an effective, as
well as practical, way to attenuate HSD-induced adverse effects, especially its impact on fatty
liver. Time-restricted feeding intervention has been successful in several animals including
Zucker obese rats [15], mice [13,14,48], and human [49], with different kinds of diets. Com-
pared to most diet and nutrition interventions, in treatment of diet-induced metabolic dis-
eases, which focus on reducing quantity and restricting energy intake, time-restricted feeding
regimens have become a preferable intervention strategy. Our study of HSD time-restricted
feeding in Wistar rats within 12 hr active phase also establishes a new evidence of achievement
of this time-restricted feeding regimen.
