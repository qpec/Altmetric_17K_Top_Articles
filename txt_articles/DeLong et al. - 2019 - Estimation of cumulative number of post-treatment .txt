treatment Lyme disease cases in the US,

Abstract
Background: Lyme disease (LD) is an infectious multi-system illness caused by the bacterial genus Borrelia and
spread by bites of infected ticks. Although most patients are successfully treated by timely antibiotic therapy, it is
broadly accepted that a sizeable number of patients experience treatment failure and continue to suffer long-term,
debilitating symptoms, including pain, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction and other symptoms. This is known as post-
treatment LD (PTLD), for which diagnosis is not standardized and treatment remains controversial. The prevalence
and societal burden of PTLD is unknown.
Methods: In an effort to help characterize the LD landscape, we estimated the number of PTLD cases in the US in
2016 and 2020 using Monte-Carlo simulation techniques, publically-available demographic datasets, uncertainty in
the inputs and realistic assumptions about incidence and treatment failure rates.
Results: Depending on the input assumptions, PTLD prevalence estimates for 2016 ranged from 69,011 persons
(95% CI 51,796 to 89,312) to 1,523,869 (CI 1,268,634 to 1,809,416). Prevalence in 2020 is predicted to be higher than
2016, and may be as high as 1,944,189 (CI 1,619,988 to 2,304,147) cases.
Conclusions: The cumulative prevalence of PLTD in the United States is estimated to be high and continues to
increase. These findings will be of interest to epidemiologists and health economists studying disease burden in
the US and elsewhere, and justify funding to study PTLD diagnosis and treatment.
Background
Lyme disease (LD) is an emerging multi-system infec-
tious illness, caused by bacteria of the Borrelia genus,
and is transmitted by bites of black-legged Ixodes ticks
[1]. The disease is the most frequent vector-borne illness
in the United States, and is increasingly reported in
Europe and Asia [2]. Researchers at the United States
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have
recently calculated annual US incidence at over 329,000
cases; however, true incidence may be higher [3, 4]. Early
LD is a flu-like illness with or without the pathogno-
monic erythema migrans rash within thirty days of the
bite. Some patients experience early neurological (facial
palsy, meningitis) and cardiac (heart block, arrhythmias)
manifestations.
Recent studies have shown that despite timely and stand-
ard antibiotic treatment of acute LD, treatment failure re-
sults in the chronic condition known as Post-Treatment
Lyme Disease, or PTLD [5, 6]. PTLD is characterized by
incapacitating fatigue, pain and neurocognitive dysfunction
that persist for more than 6 months [5, 7]. Symptoms can
be intermittent or constant, and are often subjective and
varied in nature. There is no single case definition for
PTLD, and its diagnosis is often made based on exclusion
of other conditions, such as tick-borne co-infections [8].
However, LD and its sequelae are responsible for signifi-
cant numbers of school and work absences, and are esti-
mated to cost more than $1 billion per year for healthcare
in the US [9, 10]. Moreover, the precise societal burden of
PTLD specifically, both in real time and in projected
amounts, has never been adequately quantified. Without
such information, it is impossible to effectively dedicate
healthcare resources, education and research efforts. As a
critical first step in addressing this absence, we developed a

 statistical framework to estimate the prevalence of PTLD
in the US by using Monte-Carlo simulation techniques and
applying it under six settings representing various assump-
tions about the course of the US Lyme disease epidemic.
The settings make use of available published data and
demonstrate the wide range of measures provided in the
literature. As a means of estimating the cumulative US
cases, we chose two specific index dates on which to focus:
2016 and 2020.
Methods
To estimate cumulative cases, we used inputs on Lyme
disease incidence and treatment failure rates commonly
reported in the peer-reviewed literature. We base our
simulations on the technique presented by Crouch et al.
[11] and utilize the probability distribution function
from classical statistics that most closely represents the
type of data used in each step of the simulation, i.e. the
binomial distribution for “yes/no” data and the negative
binomial distribution for overdispersed count data. We
also use a simple deterministic approach as a check for
the simulations. The six settings represent three scenar-
ios for LD incidence and two treatment failure rates
within each scenario. While any one of the settings may
currently be considered more realistic, more research is
being conducted that may change our understanding. At
that time, an improved framework could be developed
that incorporates all uncertainty into one simulation.
Input data sources
Duration of epidemic
The first cases of Lyme disease in the United States were
diagnosed in the late 1970s in the state of Connecticut
[12]. LD has emerged since then, with 96% of diagnosed
and reported cases found in 14 states, according to the
US CDC.
Yearly incidence of new Lyme infections
Based on direct surveillance reporting to state health
departments, there have been approximately 30,000 con-
firmed cases per year in the United States. However, two
recent publications by US CDC researchers suggest that
the actual number of new infections is much higher.
Hinckley et al. (2014) estimated about 288,000 new in-
fections in 2008 (range 240,000-444,000) based on sur-
veys of seven national commercial labs that performed
Lyme disease testing. Due to insensitivity in the diagnostic
tests currently used by mainstream medical authorities, in-
cidence estimates based solely on these tests are likely to
significantly undercount the numbers of infected. Nelson
et al. (2015) used data from a health insurance claims data-
base to estimate there have been approximately 329,000
incident Lyme diagnoses per year during 2005–2010 (range
296,000-376,000). These publications show that reliance on
surveillance, reported by local and regional public health
authorities results in significant under-reporting.
Age and gender of newly infected individuals
The US CDC has estimated the age and gender distribu-
tion of new Lyme disease diagnoses in the United States.
The distribution is available online at http://www.cdc.
gov/lyme/stats/graphs.html (accessed June 6, 2016). This
distribution shows two peaks, one in childhood (ages 5–9)
that is higher among boys, and one at ages 45–55 with
similar distribution by gender.
Treatment failure
Recent studies have shown that treatment failure rates
may range from 10 to 20% [13–15]. Given the variability
of treatment failure due to regional, geographical differ-
ences, socioeconomic factors, co-morbidities, treatment
delays, and non-standardized treatment protocols, we
chose to encompass both extremes of this range, basing
our estimations on either 10 or 20%.
Survival
Since LD is rarely reported as a cause of death [16], we as-
sume death rates for those with PTLD are identical to
those of the general US population. Death rates for the
general US population are available online at the US CDC
website (accessed June 6, 2016) by gender, year (1980–
2014) and 10-year age groups (except for age 0–4) [17, 18].
Distributional assumptions for simulation
Incidence of Lyme disease infections
Mean: The simulations were set up to evaluate three ar-
guably plausible assumptions about disease incidence,
since the exact growth rate of the US LD epidemic is
not known. All scenarios assumed 0 cases prior to 1981
and allowed linear growth between years for which esti-
mates are available. Scenario A represents LD cases cap-
tured for surveillance purposes and assumed linear
growth from 0 cases in 1980 to 34,449 cases in 2005,
and remained stable with 34,449 annual cases from 2005
onward. These values derive from surveillance data pub-
lished by the US CDC [19]. Scenario B similarly assumed
0 cases in 1980, linear growth to 329,000 cases in 2005
and then a stable 329,000 cases in years from 2005 on-
ward. Scenario C is the same as scenario B to 2005, but
allowed continued linear growth thereafter. Use of linear
growth in our predictions is conservative over exponen-
tial growth; the latter is a potentially realistic option in
an expanding epidemic, due to rapid growth of the vec-
tor population and tick habitats [20].
Variability: While the mean (or expected number) of
new infections was presented as input, the simulations
allowed the actual number to vary stochastically using
the negative binomial distribution with the variance set
DeLong et al. BMC Public Health          (2019) 19:352 
Page 2 of 8
 to mu + mu2/size, where mu is the mean and size is an
overdispersion parameter. This allowed uncertainty to
increase with a higher expected number of new infec-
tions. The dispersion parameter was estimated by fitting
overdispersed generalized linear negative binomial re-
gression models to the number of confirmed cases in
the CDC surveillance data from 1997 to 2017, using lin-
ear growth over time as the only independent variable
[19]. We fit two regressions due to the assumption of
Scenario A of linear growth from 1997 to 2005 with
constant incidence thereafter and because the CDC
employed two different reporting criteria before and
after 2008. The dispersion parameter estimated from the
1997–2005 data was 112, and the dispersion parameter
estimated from the 2008–2017 data was 127. To be con-
sistent with both models, the dispersion parameter, size,
was set to 120 in our simulations.
Age and gender of new infections
Mean: The mean age and gender of new infections was
assumed to follow the distribution provided by the CDC
and remain stable for the duration of the epidemic.
Variability: Each new infection was assigned to a
5-year age group and gender using a multinomial distri-
bution parametrized using the distribution of the CDC
data. Each new infection was randomly assigned an age
in years assuming a uniform distribution. After drawing
a uniform [0, 1] deviate we assigned an age as follows: if
the uniform deviate was [0–.2), we placed the individual
in the lowest age in the age group, if it was [0.2, 0.4), the
second lowest was used, etc.
Progression to PTLD
Mean: We assumed rates of treatment failure to be
10% or 20%.
Variability: With a wide range of reported rates for
transitioning to PTLD from the literature, our study
assumed these estimates were based on a relatively small
sample size of approximately 500 individuals. To model
the uncertainty, we drew a probability from a beta distri-
bution for each year with variability determined by a
sample size of 500. The parameters of the beta distribu-
tion for a mean probability, p, were alpha = p*500 and
beta = (1-p)*500. For a failure rate of 10%, p = 0.10, the
mean is 10%, and the 2 standard deviation (SD) range is
7.4 to 12.8%; for a failure rate of 20%, p = 0.20, the mean
is 20%, and the 2 SD range is 16.4 to 23.6%.
Survival
Mean: While nine cases of fatal Lyme carditis have been
recognized in national surveillance data from 1985 to
2018 in the US [21], a review of death reports and death
certificates in the US from 1999 to 2003 cited Lyme
disease as a rare cause of death [16, 22]. Survival rates
for patients with PTLD were, therefore, assumed to be
the same as the general US population and survival rates
after 2014 were assumed to be as in 2014.
Variability: Survival to the next year was simulated by
drawing a binomial random variable for each case of
PTLD, parameterized using the CDC survival rates. Our
non-parametric survival model differs from Crouch et
al., who fit a semi-parametric survival model to survival
data specific to their disease population [11].
Simulation algorithm
The simulations estimate Nth-year prevalence as de-
scribed by Crouch et al. [11]. Nth-year prevalence is the
sum of cases identified in the N-1 years prior to the
index date that survived to the index date plus the new
cases from the current year. Therefore, 1-year preva-
lence is simply the number of new PTLD patients each
year, and 2-year prevalence is the number of cases
from the prior year that survived to the current year
plus the current year’s cohort, etc. The total number
of PTLD cases at an index date of 2016 is the sum of
surviving cases since 1981, or the 36-year prevalence,
and the total number of cases in 2020 is the 40-year
prevalence.
A total of 6 simulations were performed, one for each of
the three incidence scenarios at the two PTLD progres-
sion rates (3*2 = 6). For each simulation, we performed
5000 runs and provide the median and the 2.5th and
97.5th percentiles as coverage intervals (CI) of the results
[23]. All analyses were performed in R version 3.5.1.
For each run, we did the following:
Step 1. Drew the number of incident PTLD cases per
year by age and gender, specifically
a) Drew the number of new infections each year from
1981 to 2020
b) Drew a probability of progressing to PTLD for each
year from 1980 to 2020
c) Using the probabilities in (b), randomly assigned
each new infection as recovered or PTLD
d) Randomly assigned each PTLD case a 5-year age
and gender category
e) Randomly assigned an age in years to each case
Step 2. Allowed the cohorts to age for the duration of
the epidemic, specifically
a) Determined survivors to the following year using
age, gender, and year-specific survival rates
b) Increased the age of survivors by one year
c) Added the survivors and updated as the N + 1-year
prevalence
d) Repeated for the duration of the epidemic and
appropriately tallied the results

 Step 3. Steps 1 and 2 were repeated 5000 times and
the results were stored for analysis.
Deterministic estimate of prevalence
As a check of the validity of the simulation, the expected
prevalence of PTLD cases was also estimated using a deter-
ministic approach. For each year of the epidemic, new in-
fections were expected to follow scenario A, B or C exactly,
have an age and gender distribution precisely equal to that
presented by the CDC report, exactly 10 or 20% of new
cases transitioned to PTLD, and death occurred at 80 years
of age. The deterministic values should have approximated
the mean from the simulations, but did not have associated
variability.
Results
The 2016 and 2020 PTLD prevalence estimates varied
for the three incidence scenarios and two treatment fail-
ure rates (Table 1). The 2016 estimates were highly vari-
able and ranged from a low of 69,011 persons (95% CI
51,796 to 89,312) with Scenario A and failure rate of
10%, to 1,523,869 (95% CI 1,268,634 to 1,809,416) with
Scenario C and failure rate of 20%. Regardless of inci-
dence scenario or failure rate, all results indicated an in-
crease in the prevalence of PTLD from 2016 to 2020,
with 18, 18 and 28% increases over four years under
Scenarios A, B and C, respectively. Scenario C, with the
highest 2016 prevalence estimates, also showed the largest
relative growth over the following four years. Scenario C
with a failure rate of 20% predicted a prevalence of about
2 million cases of PTLD in 2020 (1,944,189; CI: 1,619,988
to 2,304,147). Unsurprisingly, doubling the failure rate
from 10 to 20% essentially doubled the expected preva-
lence of PTLD.
The expected number of new PTLD cases per year
resulting from new infections that year is the product of
the expected number of new Lyme infections and the
treatment failure rate; as a result, our findings were sensi-
tive to these input values. However, while the prevalence
of PTLD varies by age and gender (Fig. 1), the relative dis-
tribution by age and gender was similar across all scenar-
ios (not shown). In 2020 and among females, the highest
prevalence PTLD was predicted among those aged 50 to
70 years; and among males, the prevalence was relatively
constant among those aged 15 to 65, with peaks of higher
prevalence among those aged 15 to 25 and 50 to 65.
Discussion
Although antibiotic therapy cures most LD patients, a sig-
nificant proportion of patients continue to suffer persist-
ing symptoms that can derail normal life. These include
chronic pain, neurological sequelae such as cognitive dys-
function, refractory arthritis and debilitating
fatigue.
Whether the persistence of symptoms is attributable to
LD is the subject of impassioned debate [6, 15, 24, 25].
Due to the subjective nature of many symptoms and the
absence of a diagnostic biomarker, the identification of
post-treatment LD is often based on clinical diagnosis,
and treatment is undefined and challenging. Diagnosing
PTLD with objective, quantifiable biomarkers [26–28] is
complicated and most likely involves some degree of indi-
vidual variability [29]. Despite the variation in symptoms,
it appears that risk factors for PTLD include delayed
diagnosis and treatment as well as more symptoms and
increased severity of acute LD [30–32].

 The mechanisms underlying PTLD are not under-
stood. Direct evidence of persistent pathogen replication
by culturing B. burgdorferi from patients experiencing
long-term illness is difficult. However, in the nonhuman
primate model, morphologically intact spirochetes have
been observed in the heart, brains, and adjacent to periph-
eral nerve a year after infection, with Borrelia antigen
staining in antibiotic-treated animals [33]. Several months
after infection, Borrelia spirochetes have been detected in
antibiotic-treated mice via xenodiagnoses [34]. However,
studies evaluating long-term, or repeated, antibiotic treat-
ment of PTLD patients have not shown sustained im-
provement [35–38], although there is evidence some
subgroups may benefit from retreatment [39]. Overall,
consistent evidence for continued bacterial replication in
PTLD patients is still lacking, and placebo-controlled anti-
biotic trials are complicated by the heterogeneity and
non-quantifiable nature of symptoms in these patients. It
is possible that with the development of more advanced
diagnostic technology, direct detection of bacterial replica-
tion as a measurable endpoint may eventually be possible.
In addition, or alternatively, it is possible that persisting
symptoms may be caused by dysregulation of the immune
response to Borrelia infection. LD patients with continued
symptoms have elevated inflammatory markers or cyto-
kines in blood compared to those who have recovered
[26–28, 40, 41], and transcription of genes involved in the
response to infectious microbes may differ quantitatively
and qualitatively in PTLD vs. cured patients [42].
Confounding the understanding of LD pathogenesis is
the absence of a reliable diagnostic test, which causes
imprecision in determining LD incidence. A two-stage
blood test is recommended by current CDC protocols,
and includes an enzyme immunoassay followed by a
Western blot to detect antibodies against B. burgdorferi.
Its inaccuracy, due to low sensitivity in early infection
and inability to capture bacterial strain variation, is over-
all a dismal 50–60% [43–45]. National surveillance of

 LD, based on reporting from local and regional health
authorities, is thus likely to be erroneous. Following anti-
biotic therapy, some patients may remain serologically
positive, suggesting that the presence of antibodies is
variable and uninformative [43]. Adding to the uncer-
tainty is the lack of suitable biomarkers to indicate treat-
ment endpoint and/or to suggest a transition to PTLD.
Despite the limitations in accurate diagnosis, two stud-
ies carried out by the CDC attempted to more accurately
determine the incidence of LD, calculating 329,000 cases
per year [3, 4]. Since the simulation models presented
here are based on the expected number of new LD cases
each year, this value is critical, and we incorporated the
most accurate estimates known to date. We have
coupled this information with data on incidence by age
and gender, US life expectancy and death rates, and have
constructed a simulation modeling framework to estimate
the number, along with coverage intervals, of patients who
continue to suffer PTLD. Our estimations for numbers of
PTLD cases are between 69,011 in 2016, and ~ 2 million
by 2020, suggesting a substantial number of patients living
with significant health challenges.
One caveat to our models is that although LD is an
expanding epidemic [46], its growth rate is not well de-
fined. Thus, which incidence scenario is most realistic is
difficult to determine. Scenario A, based on linear growth
in the numbers of LD cases until 2005, followed by static
low numbers thereafter, seems less plausible than the
other two scenarios that include steady, sustained growth.
Scenario B proposes growth until 2005, followed by a con-
stant number of LD cases per year. This latter incidence is
based on CDC estimates of 329,000 cases per year, rather
than surveillance data. Scenario C is based on linear LD
incidence growth from 1980 onwards.
We acknowledge and incorporate uncertainty in dis-
ease incidence and treatment failure rates by simulating
six settings, each providing an estimate of prevalence
under the assumption that the setting is correct. As a
result, estimates of uncertainty come from the probability
distribution function generating the type of data used as in-
put, and do not incorporate uncertainty about the mechan-
ism generating the data (i.e. the setting). The uncertainty in
the data-generating mechanism is shown by examining the
differences in the results across all six settings.
An alternate approach could have been to incorporate
all uncertainty within one scenario, perhaps weighing each
scenario based on some knowledge base. The result would
be essentially a weighted average of the results presented
here with very wide 95% coverage intervals. Alternatively,
this question could be cast in a Bayesian framework and
could incorporate expert opinion as priors. Unfortunately,
as of now, the weights and priors are unknown. An im-
proved diagnostic test, with national surveillance, and re-
search into treatment failure rates will likely provide more
precise information to indicate which setting optimally fits
the dynamics of the epidemic.
Nevertheless, our findings suggest that there are large
numbers of patients living with LD-related chronic illness.
Due to the lack of a single case definition or single, shared
phenotype for PTLD, private and public health insurance
does not include the costs of caring for these individuals,
who must personally pay for these expenses. Even during
acute infection, LD patients are estimated to cost approxi-
mately $3000 per person annually in medical billing [9].
During long-term illness, costs are likely to be much more.
A Dutch study estimated more than 1.7 disability-adjusted
life years lost per patient, due to persisting Lyme borreliosis,
suggesting a significant economic and societal burden [10].
Here, our estimations indicate many chronically ill US pa-
tients in present time as well as into the future. Their large
numbers, as well as the economic and personal conse-
quences they suffer, warrant further evidence-based, rigor-
ous research to determine the causes of treatment failures,
to predict which LD patients are at risk, and to design more
effective therapies. Additionally, further studies are urgently
needed in the LD field, to improve diagnostic tests, increase
medical and public awareness, and to accurately define the
numbers of infected and chronically ill.
Conclusions
Using statistical simulation techniques, we have estimated
that the cumulative prevalence of PTLD in the US is high
and substantially greater than the yearly incidence. We
found that prevalence in 2020 is projected to be higher
than 2016, and may be as high as 1,944,189 (CI: 1,619,988
to 2,304,147) cases. These findings are relevant to consid-
eration of expected costs for Lyme disease treatment and
the care of those with PTLD.
