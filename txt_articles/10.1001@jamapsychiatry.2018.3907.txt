IMPORTANCE Drug repurposing is potentially cost-effective, low risk, and necessary in
psychiatric drug development. The availability of large, routine data sets provides the
opportunity to evaluate the potential for currently used medication to benefit people
with serious mental illness (SMI).
OBJECTIVE To determine whether hydroxylmethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors
(HMG-CoA RIs), L-type calcium channel (LTCC) antagonists, and biguanides are associated
with reduced psychiatric hospitalization and self-harm in individuals with SMI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS These within-individual cohort studies of patients with
SMI compared rates of psychiatric hospitalization and self-harm during periods of exposure
and nonexposure to the study drugs, with adjusting for a number of time-varying covariates.
Participants included 142 691 individuals from the entire population of Sweden with a
diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BPD), schizophrenia, or nonaffective psychosis (NAP) who were
15 years or older and who were treated with psychiatric medication from October 1, 2005,
through December 31, 2016. Data were analyzed from April 1 through August 31, 2018.
INTERVENTIONS Treatment with HMG-CoA RIs, LTCC antagonists, or biguanides.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Psychiatric hospitalizations and self-harm admissions.
RESULTS Among the 142 691 eligible participants, the HMG-CoA RI exposure periods were
associated with reduced rates of psychiatric hospitalization in BPD (adjusted hazard ratio
[aHR], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.83-0.89; P < .001), schizophrenia (aHR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.71-0.79;
P < .001), and NAP (aHR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.75-0.85; P < .001) and reduced self-harm rates in
BPD (aHR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.66-0.86; P < .001) and schizophrenia (aHR, 0.58; 95% CI,
0.45-0.74; P < .001). Exposure to LTCC antagonists was associated with reduced rates of
psychiatric hospitalization and self-harm in subgroups with BPD (aHRs, 0.92 [95% CI,
0.88-0.96; P < .001] and 0.81 [95% CI, 0.68-0.95; P = .01], respectively), schizophrenia
(aHRs, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.74-0.85; P < .001] and 0.30 [95% CI, 0.18-0.48; P < .001],
respectively), and NAP (aHRs, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.83-0.96; P = .002] and 0.56 [95% CI,
0.42-0.74; P < .001], respectively). During biguanide exposure, psychiatric hospitalization
rates were reduced in subgroups with BPD (aHR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.77-0.84; P < .001),
schizophrenia (aHR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.69-0.77; P < .001), and NAP (aHR, 0.85; 95% CI,
0.79-0.92; P < .001), and self-harm was reduced in BPD (aHR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.84;
P < .001) and schizophrenia (aHR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.48-0.85; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study provides additional evidence that exposure to
HMG-CoA RIs, LTCC antagonists, and biguanides might lead to improved outcomes for
individuals with SMI. Given the well-known adverse event profiles of these agents, they
should be further investigated as repurposed agents for psychiatric symptoms.

 S
erious mental illnesses (SMIs), including bipolar disor-
der (BPD), schizophrenia, and nonaffective psychoses
(NAP), are associated with high levels of morbidity and
are challenging to treat. Many drugs have been identified as
havingpotentialforrepurposinginthesedisorders.1,2Wecross-
referenced these drugs with the most commonly prescribed
drugs in the general population.3 We chose to investigate the
following 3 classes of drugs for which we might expect clini-
cal benefit: hydroxylmethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase in-
hibitors (HMG-CoA RIs; ie, statins), L-type calcium channel
(LTCC) antagonists (eg, verapamil hydrochloride), and bigu-
anides (eg, metformin hydrochloride).
A recent meta-analysis of statins as adjunctive therapy
for schizophrenia included 6 placebo-controlled randomized
clinical trials (RCTs) and found a reduction in the Positive
and Negative Symptom Scale scores in patients receiving
statins for 12 weeks; however, only 169 received active treat-
ment, and the reduction fell below the threshold considered
clinically meaningful.4 Theorized mechanisms for HMG-CoA
RI psychiatric action are via anti-inflammatory effects or via
increased absorption and central nervous system uptake of
antipsychotics.4 A systematic review and meta-analysis of
LTCC antagonists for the treatment of BPD5 included 2 RCTs
of verapamil vs placebo and 4 of verapamil vs lithium for the
treatment of mania. The investigators found no evidence of
an effect. However, no trials of other LTCC antagonists and
no studies in BPD depression or prophylaxis have been per-
formed. Evidence of calcium dysregulation in BPD has long
been available; this evidence is supported by more recent
pharmacologic, genetic, and molecular findings.6 Similarly,
calcium signaling is implicated in the etiology of schizophre-
nia, where LTCC antagonists are also a potential adjuvant
treatment.7 However, very limited and inconsistent trial evi-
dence for their use in this disorder exists.8 A trial of metfor-
min has been undertaken to counter antipsychotic-related
weight gain,9 but metformin is also hypothesized to improve
cognitive and mood dysfunction symptoms via mitigation of
metabolic disturbances.10 Therefore, although none of these
drugs have been comprehensively investigated as repur-
posed agents to improve mental disorders, each has a theo-
retical basis for effectiveness.
We investigated whether people in the Swedish popula-
tion with SMI had lower rates of psychiatric hospitalization
and self-harm during periods when they were prescribed
HMG-CoA RIs, LTCC antagonists, and biguanides. Owing
to the risks of confounding by indication, we used a design
that compared within-individual periods with and without
medication exposure,11 which controls for time-fixed con-
founders. In view of the proposed mechanism of action
of each drug on psychiatric symptoms, we hypothesized
that effects would be similar across SMI subtypes. We
also examined rates of nonpsychiatric hospitalization in
these groups and hypothesized that, contrary to psychiatric
effects, nonpsychiatric hospitalizations would only be
reduced in the group exposed to biguanides because these
agents have an acute physical effect, whereas HMG-CoA RIs
and LTCC antagonists have a longer-term mechanism of
action.

Definition of SMI
We defined diagnoses of BPD, schizophrenia, and NAP in
line with previous research using Swedish National Patient
Registers.12,13 Individuals had at least 1 record of inpatient or
outpatient contact with codes from the International Classi-
fication of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and International
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Prob-
lems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) consistent with the diagnosis
(eTable 1 in the Supplement) and a period of drug treatment
with an appropriate psychotropic medication (antipsychotic,
lithium, or anticonvulsant class mood stabilizer) from Octo-
ber 1, 2005, through December 31, 2016. Validation studies
suggest that using inpatient SMI diagnosis alone has high posi-
tive predictive power (0.94) but potentially misses suitable pa-
tientsowingtotypeIIerror(negativepredictivepower, 0.23).14

Key Points
Question Are drugs in common use for physical health problems
(hydroxylmethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, L-type
calcium channel antagonists, and biguanides) associated with
reduced rates of psychiatric hospitalization and self-harm in
individuals with serious mental illness?
Findings In this series of within-individual cohort studies
of 142 691 patients with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or
nonaffective psychosis, exposure to any of the study drugs was
associated with reduced rates of psychiatric hospitalizaiton
compared with unexposed periods. Self-harm was reduced in
patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia during exposure
to all study drugs and in patients with nonaffective psychosis
taking L-type calcium channel antagonists.
Meaning Hydroxylmethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase
inhibitors, L-type calcium channel antagonists, and biguanides
hold potential as repurposed agents in serious mental illness, and
the central nervous system mechanism of action of these drugs
requires further investigation.

 Sweden, oral medications are rarely dispensed for longer than
3 months at a time. In line with previous studies, we defined
a medication period as a sequence of at least 2 prescriptions,
with no more than 3 months (93 days) between any 2 consecu-
tive prescriptions.15,16 Therefore, individuals were defined as
exposed to medication during the interval between 2 dis-
pensed prescriptions unless the dispensed prescriptions oc-
curred more than 3 months apart. To determine whether an
individual was exposed or nonexposed to the medication ini-
tially, the follow-up start was set to October 1, 2005, because
the coverage of the Prescribed Drug Register started on July 1,
2005.
Outcomes
Outcomes were psychiatric hospitalization (identified by ward
admission codes and ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for admission in-
dication) and self-harm (with suicidal and undetermined in-
tent) (eTable 1 in the Supplement). We also examined rates of
nonpsychiatric hospitalization. Outcome data came from the
National Patient Register.
Time-Varying Confounders
As a result of the within-individual design, time-fixed covar-
iates (eg, sex, age at illness onset) cannot confound any asso-
ciation between the study drug and the outcome of interest.
Time-varying confounders were included to capture the po-
tential for changes in psychiatric symptoms over time, includ-
ing age, year, number of previous outcome events (ie, hospi-
talizations, episodes of self-harm), exposure to psychiatric
medication (ie, mood stabilizer or antipsychotic), and a count
of exposed and nonexposed periods.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from April 1 through August 31, 2018. We
performed within-individual analyses using stratified Cox pro-
portional hazards regression. This method, by design, exclu-
sively draws information from individuals who ever experi-
enced the outcome of interest during follow-up.17 Therefore,
a different cohort is identified and analyzed for each combi-
nation of drug exposure and outcome. We split follow-up time
into consecutive periods. A new period started after a medi-
cation switch (ie, starting and stopping medication) or an out-
come event (after the date of discharge). For the latter, we re-
started the period at baseline (ie, the time since the last event).
Drug treatments were defined as time-varying dichotomous
exposures. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and
95% CIs for differences in outcome event rate between medi-
cation exposure and nonexposure periods; 2-sided P values
were calculated using Wald tests.
Additional Analyses
We tested for an interaction between HMG-CoA RI and anti-
psychotic medication exposure, because of the theory that
HMG-CoA RIs may increase uptake of antipsychotics by the
central nervous system.4 We then performed several sensitiv-
ity analyses. First, we examined differences in rates of the 3
outcomes in periods that patients with SMI were exposed or
not exposed to thiazide diuretics. We chose this class of drug
as a negative control; no evidence suggests that exposure to
thiazide diuretics should improve psychiatric outcomes, so
lower rates during exposed periods might suggest that stability
of SMI symptoms is associated with a period of medication ad-
herence rather than a direct effect of the medication on psy-
chiatric symptoms (ie, reverse causality). Second, we adjusted
for time with and without each of the other study drugs and
physical health problems experienced by the individual (car-
diovascular or cerebrovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hy-
pertension, and hyperlipidemia). Third, we excluded from the
analysis individuals who died during the follow-up period
because they may have a more rapidly varying risk of the out-
comes of interest. Fourth, we excluded psychiatric admis-
sions, which were prompted by admissions for self-harm
(ie, a psychiatric admission in the 7 days after a self-harm ad-
mission), to examine whether self-harm and psychiatric ad-
missions were independent. Finally, we extended the defini-
tion of the drug exposure period and defined it as constant if
a new prescription was issued within 4 months (124 days) of
the previous prescription and extended the exposure period
to 2 months (62 days) after the last dispensed date to account
forpotentialexposuremisclassificationinourprimaryanalysis.
Results
These studies drew from the entire population of Sweden who
ever received an inpatient or outpatient diagnosis of SMI and
were treated with an antipsychotic or mood stabilizer medi-
cation from October 1, 2005, through December 31, 2016
(eFigure in the Supplement). This base population included
76 759 patients with BPD, 30 954 with schizophrenia, and
34 978 with NAP for a total of 142 691 patients.
HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors
Of the patients described above, 6176 with BPD (3493 female
[56.6%] and 2683 male [43.4%]; mean [SD] age, 55.3 [12.3]
years), 2705 with schizophrenia (1084 female [40.1%] and 1621
male [59.9%]; mean [SD] age, 49.6 [12.6] years), and 2958 with
NAP (1603 female [54.2%] and 1355 male [45.8%]; mean [SD]
age, 57.8 [15.0] years) were also prescribed HMG-CoA RIs and
experienced psychiatric hospitalization (Table 1). All sub-
groups of SMI had reduced rates of psychiatric hospitaliza-
tion during HMG-CoA RI exposure after adjusting for age, year,
number of previous hospitalizations, psychiatric medication
exposure, and number of exposure periods (aHR for BPD, 0.86
[95% CI, 0.83-0.89]; aHR for schizophrenia, 0.75 [95% CI,
0.71-0.79]; and aHR for NAP, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.75-0.85]; P < .001
for all). Individuals with BPD (aHR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.66-0.86;
P < .001) or schizophrenia diagnoses (aHR, 0.58; 95% CI,
0.45-0.74; P < .001) had lower rates of self-harm during HMG-
CoA RI exposure periods compared with nonexposure peri-
ods (Table 2; eTable 3 in the Supplement). Exposure status for
HMG-CoA RIs was not associated with nonpsychiatric hospi-
talization, apart from in the NAP subgroup (aHR, 1.04; 95% CI,
1.01-1.08; P = .02) (Table 2; eTable 4 in the Supplement). We
found no evidence of an interaction between HMG-CoA
RI and antipsychotic exposure. Adjustment for additional

Discussion
As far as we are aware, this study is the first to suggest that pe-
riodsofexposuretoHMG-CoARIs,LTCCantagonists,andbigu-
anides are associated with lower rates of psychiatric admission
and self-harm in patients with SMI. Each of these drugs has a
theoreticalbasisforeffectivelyreducingpsychiatricsymptoms.
We found that periods of HMG-CoA RI exposure were asso-
ciatedwithreducedpsychiatrichospitalizationinallsubgroups
ofSMIandwithreducedself-harminBPDandschizophrenia.Sev-
eral actions of HMG-CoA RIs could explain our findings. Statins

Exposure to LTCC antagonists was associated with re-
duced rates of psychiatric hospitalization and self-harm. The
LTCCs have been implicated in the physiopathology of a range
of mental health conditions, including mood disorders, ad-
diction, dementia, sleep disorders,6 and psychotic illness.7 In-
hibition of LTCCs has cardiodepressant and vasodilatory ac-
tions, but isoforms of LTCCs are widely distributed beyond the
cardiovascular system, including neurons.25 These isoforms
appear to control emotional behavior in animal models and are
associated with antidepressant and anxiolytic effects.25
Periods of metformin exposure were associated with re-
duced psychiatric and nonpsychiatric hospitalization across all
SMIsubgroups.Self-harmwasreducedinindividualswithBPD
and schizophrenia during biguanide exposure. Metformin has
been widely investigated in psychiatry because of its poten-
tial to attenuate antipsychotic-induced weight gain, includ-
ing in patients without diabetes.26 Unfortunately, these trials
didnotroutinelyreportchangesinpsychiatricsymptoms.Met-
formin may potentially improve symptoms in SMI because of
underlying disturbed cerebral use of glucose, particularly in
brainareaslinkedtocognitiveimpairmentsinschizophrenia.27
Hypercholesterolemia,hypertension,diabetes,andpredia-
betes are more common in people with SMI, and evidence sug-
gests that they are not as rigorously treated as in the general
population.28Ourfindingsnotwithstanding,moreeffortshould

tempted to investigate whether periods of symptom stability
were associated with adherence to any prescribed medication
and a reduced rate of psychiatric hospitalization and self-harm
byexaminingnonpsychiatrichospitalizationratesandbystudy-
ing a drug class that should have no effect on psychiatric out-
comes. Nonpsychiatric hospitalization was not associated with
HMG-CoA RI or LTCC antagonist exposure periods, suggesting
no global effect on health service use. The effects seem specific
to psychiatric outcomes. Biguanide exposure was probably as-
sociated with reduced nonpsychiatric hospitalization because
thisclassofmedicationhasmoreacuteeffects.Thiazidediuret-
ics, a group of medications that have no theorized basis for im-
proving psychiatric symptoms, were not associated with rates
of psychiatric hospitalization or self-harm rate but were associ-
ated with reduced rates of nonpsychiatric hospitalization. This

 Conclusions
If substantiated, this study has considerable implications for
clinical practice and drug development. The study drugs—
HMG-CoA RIs, LTCC antagonists, and biguanides—are glob-
ally licensed, commonly used, cheap, and relatively safe medi-
cations. They are therefore ideal candidates for repurposing.
Understanding their mode of action on the central nervous
system may facilitate better understanding of the pathophysi-
ology of SMI and offer opportunities for innovative pharma-
cotherapy development.
