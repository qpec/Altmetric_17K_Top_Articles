ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To determine whether feeding infants with hydrolysed 
formula reduces their risk of allergic or autoimmune 
disease.
Design
Systematic review and meta-analysis, as part of a 
series of systematic reviews commissioned by the UK 
Food Standards Agency to inform guidelines on infant 
feeding. Two authors selected studies by consensus, 
independently extracted data, and assessed the 
quality of included studies using the Cochrane risk of 
bias tool.
Data sOurCes
Medline, Embase, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and 
LILACS searched between January 1946 and April 2015.
eligibility Criteria fOr seleCting stuDies
Prospective intervention trials of hydrolysed cows’ 
milk formula compared with another hydrolysed 
formula, human breast milk, or a standard cows’ milk 
formula, which reported on allergic or autoimmune 
disease or allergic sensitisation.
results
37 eligible intervention trials of hydrolysed formula 
were identified, including over 19 000 participants. 
There was evidence of conflict of interest and high or 
unclear risk of bias in most studies of allergic 
outcomes and evidence of publication bias for studies 
of eczema and wheeze. Overall there was no 
consistent evidence that partially or extensively 
hydrolysed formulas reduce risk of allergic or 
autoimmune outcomes in infants at high pre-existing 
risk of these outcomes. Odds ratios for eczema at age 
0-4, compared with standard cows’ milk formula, were 
0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.07; I2=30%) for 
partially hydrolysed formula; 0.55 (0.28 to 1.09; 
I2=74%) for extensively hydrolysed casein based
formula; and 1.12 (0.88 to 1.42; I2=0%) for extensively 
hydrolysed whey based formula. There was no 
evidence to support the health claim approved by the 
US Food and Drug Administration that a partially 
hydrolysed formula could reduce the risk of eczema 
nor the conclusion of the Cochrane review that 
hydrolysed formula could prevent allergy to cows’ milk.
COnClusiOn
These findings do not support current guidelines that 
recommend the use of hydrolysed formula to prevent 
allergic disease in high risk infants.

Introduction
Immune mediated health conditions such as allergic 
and autoimmune diseases seem to have increased in 
prevalence in many countries and are leading causes 
of chronic illness in young people.1  There is evidence 
that dietary exposures in infancy can influence the 
risk of these diseases, with a specific concern that 
early exposure to intact cows’ milk protein in the form 
of infant formula could trigger the onset of allergic or 
autoimmune disease.2-4  Current infant feeding guide-
lines in North America, Australasia, and Europe rec-
ommend the use of hydrolysed formula in the first 4-6 
months of life in place of a standard cows’ milk for-
mula for the primary prevention of allergic diseases in 
childhood.5-7  This has also been supported by the US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)8  and by a 
Cochrane systematic review.9 10 To inform guidelines 
on infant feeding in the United Kingdom, we under-
took a systematic review of hydrolysed formula for pre-
venting allergic sensitisation, allergic disease, or 
autoimmune disease.
Methods
This review is reported in accordance with PRISMA 
guidance. The review is one of a series of systematic 
reviews commissioned by the UK Food Standards 
Agency to inform UK guidelines on infant feeding, 
under the title “review of scientific published literature 
on infant feeding and development of atopic and auto-
immune disease.” The protocols for the systematic 
reviews were registered with the International 
 
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews

5 August 2013, before titles were screened or studies

and infant diet.” As part of this project we also 
searched for other systematic reviews covering the 
same topic published since 1 January 2011 with a 
revised AMSTAR score ≥32.11 No such reviews were 
identified for hydrolysed formula.
study interventions and comparators
We included studies of any hydrolysed formula of cows’ 
milk origin as the intervention of interest, compared 
with any non-hydrolysed cows’ milk formula, human 
milk, or another type of hydrolysed cows’ milk formula. 
Also included were studies in which hydrolysed for-
mula was given as part of a multifaceted intervention, 
which we defined as an intervention with at least two 
other components in addition to the hydrolysed for-
mula—for example, exclusion of allergenic food from 
the mother’s diet, promotion of breastfeeding, delayed 
introduction of solid food, or measures to avoid expo-
sure to house dust mite. We also included studies in 
which other interventions were applied to both inter-
vention and control groups, such as exclusion of cows’ 
milk from the mother’s diet during lactation. Studies of 
hydrolysed formula of milk other than cows’ milk, such 
as hydrolysed rice, goats’ milk, or soya formula, were 
not included. We did not use a specific definition of par-
tially or extensively hydrolysed formula but relied on 
the definition and/or trade name of formula as stated in 
the individual studies.
study designs and populations
We included all intervention trials and searched for 
observational studies but did not extract data from 
these because of the evidence from intervention trials. 
Intervention trials were classified as randomised con-
trolled trials, in which the method of treatment alloca-
tion was random; as quasi-randomised controlled 
trials, in which the method of treatment allocation 
was not totally random (but was thought unlikely to 
lead to imbalance between treatment groups in vari-
ables relevant to the outcome measures); and as con-
trolled clinical trials, in which treatment allocation 
was non-random and likely to lead to imbalance 
between treatment groups. Controlled clinical trials 
were analysed separately from randomised controlled 
trials/quasi randomised controlled trials. We included 
studies of infant feeding between birth and 12 months 
of age and excluded studies in which infants or their 
mothers were defined by the presence of a pre-existing 
disease state, including very low birth weight or pre-
mature infants.
study outcomes
Atopic and autoimmune outcomes were selected on 
the basis of their population prevalence in children 
and young adults in the UK and/or other affluent 
nations. We included diseases with a prevalence of at 
least one in 1000 children/adolescents or young 
adults (aged <40) but did not include rarer diseases. 
Atopic outcomes included were asthma (categorised 
as wheeze, recurrent wheeze, atopic wheeze, bron-
chial hyper-reactivity, forced vital capacity, peak 
expiratory flow rate, forced expiratory volume in one 
second), eczema, allergic rhinitis and/or conjunctivi-
tis, food allergy, allergic sensitisation (that is, skin 
prick or specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) assess-
ment, or total IgE level). Autoimmune outcomes 
included were type 1 diabetes mellitus (defined sero-
logically and/or clinically), coeliac disease (defined 
serologically and/or clinically), inflammatory bowel 
disease, autoimmune thyroid disease, juvenile rheu-
matoid arthritis, vitiligo, or psoriasis. For atopic out-
comes, we grouped age at assessment as 0-4, 5-14, 
15-24, 25-44, 45-64, and ≥65. Because of a paucity of 
outcome data in adults, we pooled age groups ≥15. 
Autoimmune outcomes were not stratified for analy-
ses by age at outcome assessment.
Data sources
The search strategies included both text terms and sub-
ject heading terms where appropriate and were initially 
developed for Medline and then adapted for other data-
bases. We searched the Cochrane Library (2013, issue 7), 
Embase (1947 to July 2013), LILACS (1982 to July 2013), 
Medline (1946 to July 2013), and Web of Science (1970 to 
July 2013) on 25 July 2013 and reran the searches on 
17 April 2015. We included all studies published up to 
that date and studies in progress or completed but 
unpublished identified through http://apps.who.int/
trialsearch/. Peer reviewed publications and abstract 
publications were included if they contained data that 
had not subsequently been published as a peer 
reviewed publication. We reviewed the bibliography of 
eligible studies for possible additional publications and 
included all eligible publications, regardless of the lan-
guage. Authors of eligible or potentially eligible studies 
were not contacted for original data. We extensively 
piloted and refined the search strategies to optimise 
sensitivity, comparing search results with those of other 
published systematic reviews. Appendix 1 shows the 
Medline search strategies for the complete systematic 
review project.
study selection
Seven trained researchers (RJB, VG-L, DI, NG, KJ, JC, 
ZR) screened titles and abstracts in duplicate. Two 
researchers screened titles independently and met to 
agree on inclusion. Their screening was checked by a 
third member of the team, and uncertainties were 
brought to a full team meeting for discussion. This pro-
cedure took place between February and April 2014 
and in April and May 2015 (RJB, TK, VG-L), with weekly 
team meetings to discuss uncertainties about study eli-
gibility. The full text of all potentially eligible studies 
was reviewed.
assessment of risk of bias
We assessed risk of bias in included intervention stud-
ies with a modified version of the Cochrane Collabora-
tion risk of bias tool, which assessed sequence 
generation and allocation concealment (selection 
bias), blinding of outcome assessors and validity of 
the outcome assessment tool (assessment bias), and

incomplete outcome data (attrition bias; considered 
high where <70% of randomised participants had out-
come data available). We modified the tool by includ-
ing an assessment of conflict of interest, judged as low 
when there was no evidence of industry involvement 
in study design, analysis, interpretation, or publica-
tion and no evidence that study authors received 
remuneration from relevant industry partners for 
other activities.
Data extraction
DI, VG-L, RJB, and JL-B developed, piloted, and refined 
an Excel data extraction form. Two researchers 
(RJB, and TK or TA) extracted data in duplicate. 
 
Disagreements and uncertainties about data coding 
were discussed within the team with leads as follows: 
RJB (clinical queries), VG-L (dietetic queries), DI (anal-
ysis and coding queries), and JL-B (study design and 
statistics queries). For foreign language studies, VG-L 
extracted data with a native speaker of the relevant 
language (see acknowledgements section). We 
extracted all relevant data from included studies, 
including data that we could not meta-analyse. Data 
were extracted either with raw frequencies or crude or 
adjusted effect estimates. We undertook random effect 
meta-analysis. When this was not possible or not 
appropriate we summarised study results in a narra-
tive table.
Data selection for analysis
We extracted outcome data that adhered to the inten-
tion to treat principle in preference to data based on 
per protocol analyses. When studies included multiple 
intervention groups, we performed pairwise compari-
sons in which we split the number of events and no 
events in the unexposed/control group to prevent dou-
ble counting. When studies reported data at multiple 
time points within one of our predefined age group-
ings, we extracted the most complete dataset avail-
able, beyond the intervention period (that is, from age 
1 onwards). This is the dataset with the largest denom-
inator or when the denominator is identical for multi-
ple time points then the largest numerator (number of 
events) is used. When studies reported multiple 
assessments of the same outcome at the same time 
point, we selected clinical assessments in preference 
to serological assessments and skin prick in prefer-
ence to assessment of specific IgE of allergic sensitisa-
tion. The GINI study12-15 used generalised estimating 
equations (GEE) to generate odds ratios in some of 
their publications. This represents the most complete 
data available from the study, so we selected this in 
preference to other GINI study data analyses. Raw data 
or risk ratios were not given in the generalised estimat-
ing equations reports. So for analyses that include 
such data from the GINI study we calculated odds 
ratios in place of risk ratios to be able to include the 
most complete GINI study data available in meta-anal-
ysis. For some meta-analyses generalised estimating 
equation data from the GINI trial were either not 
reported or could not be used because of multiple 
intervention groups, and in these meta-analyses we 
used the most complete non-generalised estimating 
equation data available.
Data synthesis
We presented pooled results for binary outcomes from 
intervention studies as risk ratios calculated from the 
frequencies given in the study or as odds ratios when 
pooled data included those from a generalised estimat-
ing equation analysis and/or adjusted effect estimates. 
We pooled risk ratios using the Mantel-Haenszel 
method (with continuity correction of 0.5 in studies 
with zero cell frequencies) and odds ratios using the 
generic inverse variance method in the statistical pro-
gramme R (R version 3.1.0, 2014, www.r-project.org). 
Pooled data for continuous outcomes measured with 
similar scales are presented as mean differences with 
95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was quantified 
with I2 and classified as low (<25%), moderate (5-50%), 
high (50-75%), or extreme (>75%). Data were not pooled 
when I2≥80%. We undertook subgroup analyses for 
meta-analyses with more than five studies and assessed 
for publication bias (small study bias) using funnel 
plots and Egger’s asymmetry test when there were 10 or 
more studies in a meta-analysis. We undertook sub-
group analyses according to low versus unclear/high 
overall risk of bias; high versus normal/low risk of dis-
ease; quasi-randomised controlled trial versus ran-
domised controlled trial; low versus unclear/high risk 
of conflict of interest; multifaceted versus not multifac-
eted intervention; and casein versus whey dominant 
hydrolysate.
Patient involvement
The findings of this study form part of the UK govern-
ment’s review of advice to the general public on infant 
feeding. No patients were involved in setting the 
research question or the outcome measures, nor were 
they involved in developing plans for design or imple-
mentation of the study. No patients were asked to 
advise on interpretation or writing up of results.
Results
Our original search identified 16 289 original titles. 
Screening of titles, abstracts, and full text yielded 52 
studies (37 intervention trials) of hydrolysed formula, 
including over 19 000 participants. There were 28 
randomised controlled trials, six quasi-randomised 
controlled trials, and three controlled clinical trials 
describing allergic or autoimmune outcomes. Appen-
dix 2 shows full details of the search results (PRISMA 
flow chart), and characteristics of included studies 
are summarised in tables A and B in appendix 3. 
Twenty three studies used partially hydrolysed for-
mula, and in at least 15 cases this was one specific 
formula (Nan HA/Good Start/Nidina HA/Beba HA, 
Nestlé, Vevey, Switzerland). Eighteen studies used 
extensively hydrolysed formula, and five studies 
(three for extensively, two for partially hydrolysed 
formula) used hydrolysed formula as part of a multi-
faceted intervention. In 30 of 37 studies infants were

family history of disease in a first degree relative. 
Risk of bias and risk of conflict of interest were 
unclear or high in most studies for allergic outcomes 
(fig 1 ; table C in appendix 3), but low or unclear in 
most studies for autoimmune outcomes (fig 1 ; table D 
in appendix 3). Figure 2  (partially hydrolysed

risk of eczema
Twenty seven studies reported the effect of hydrolysed 
formula in infancy on risk of childhood eczema. The 
pooled data show no significant difference between 
extensively hydrolysed formula and standard cows’ 
milk formula in risk of eczema at age 0-4 (odds ratio 
0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.07; I2=30%) or 
age 5-14 (0.86, 0.72 to 1.02; I2=0%). Subgroup analysis 
suggested a significant difference in outcome according 
to study design or disease risk, with a more positive out-
come in the single quasi-randomised controlled trial of 
normal risk infants. Analysis of data from randomised 
controlled trials for the most commonly studied par-
tially hydrolysed formula (Nan HA/Good Start/Nidina 
HA/Beba HA, Nestlé, Vevey, Switzerland) showed no 
significant effect on risk of eczema at age 0-4 (0.94, 0.75

to 1.17; I2=0%). Though a meta-analysis of two studies 
on extensively hydrolysed formula found reduced odds 
of eczema at age 5-14 in children fed casein dominant 
formula during infancy (0.71, 0.59 to 0.87; I2=0%), this 
effect was not seen for eczema at age 0-4 or for whey 
dominant formula at any age (0-4 or 5-14). Direct com-
parison of extensively versus partially hydrolysed for-
mula, and casein versus whey dominant extensively 
hydrolysed formula, did not show a significant differ-
ence in risk of eczema at age 0-4 or 5-14. When we com-
bined data for partially and extensively hydrolysed 
formula as “any hydrolysed formula” there was evi-
dence of reduced eczema at age 0-4 (but not at age 5-14). 
This analysis necessitated use of per protocol data from 
the GINI study, had high statistical heterogeneity, and 
showed evidence of publication bias (fig 8).
risk of wheeze
Twenty one studies reported the effect of hydrolysed for-
mula in infancy on risk of wheeze or recurrent wheeze. 
Analysis of the outcome “wheeze” was inconclusive, 
with meta-analyses of partially hydrolysed formula 
dominated by a multifaceted intervention study in 
which uptake of the intervention was low and a qua-
si-randomised controlled trial with high risk of bias and 
conflict of interest. Meta-analysis of extensively hydro-
lysed formula was not possible because of extreme het-
erogeneity. Analysis of the outcome “recurrent wheeze” 
showed no significant difference between partially 
hydrolysed formula and standard cows’ milk formula for 
recurrent wheeze at age 0-4 (odds ratio 0.82, 95% confi-
dence interval 0.48 to 1.41; I2=15%) or age 5-14 (0.99, 0.65 
to 1.51; I2=43%), and findings were also not significant 
for meta-analysis of casein or whey dominant exten-
sively hydrolysed formula at ages 0-4 or 5-14. Direct com-
parison of extensively versus partially hydrolysed 
formula, and casein versus whey dominant extensively 
hydrolysed formula, did not show a significant differ-
ence in risk of recurrent wheeze at age 0-4 or 5-14. When 
data for both types of formula were combined as “any 
hydrolysed formula” there was no evidence of reduced 
recurrent wheeze at age 0-4 or age 5-14—this analysis 
necessitated use of per protocol data for the GINI study, 
and showed evidence of publication bias (fig 9).

hydrolysed formula (but not extensively hydrolysed 
formula) was associated with significantly reduced 
risk of allergic rhinitis, though this meta-analysis was 
dominated by a multifaceted intervention study in 
which uptake of the intervention was low. At age 5-14 
neither partially (odds ratio 1.03, 95% confidence 
interval 0.82 to 1.30; I2=0%) nor extensively (casein 
0.87
, 0.66 to 1.15; I2=0%; whey 0.93, 0.69 to 1.26; single 
study) hydrolysed formula were associated with a sig-
nificant reduction in allergic rhinitis. Direct compari-
son of the two formulas, and casein versus whey 
dominant extensively  
hydrolysed formula, did not 
show a significant difference in risk of allergic rhinitis 
at age 0-4 or 5-14.
risk of food allergy or allergic sensitisation
Thirteen and 19 studies reported the effect of hydro-
lysed formula on risk of food allergy and allergic sen-
sitisation, respectively. There was no significant 
difference in risk of “any food allergy” with partially 
(risk ratio 1.73, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 3.80; 
I2=42%) or extensively (0.86, 0.26 to 2.82; I2=42%) 
hydrolysed formula compared with standard formula 
at age 0-4, nor for extensively hydrolysed formula at 
age 5-14. We also found no difference in food allergy to 
cows’ milk, egg, or (partially hydrolysed formula 
only) peanut. Direct comparison of the two formulas 
(egg allergy) and casein versus whey dominant exten-
sively hydrolysed formula showed no significant dif-
ference in risk of food allergy. There was no significant 
difference in risk of allergic sensitisation to cows’ 
milk with partially (1.30, 0.65 to 2.60; I2=0%) or exten-
sively (0.77, 0.09 to 6.73; I2=77%) hydrolysed formula, 
and no significant difference between groups for risk 
of allergic sensitisation to “any allergen” or raised 
total IgE level.
risk of type 1 diabetes mellitus
Six studies reported the effect of extensively hydrolysed 
formula compared with standard formula in infancy on 
risk of type 1 diabetes mellitus. There was no significant 
difference in risk with extensively hydrolysed formula 
(risk ratio 1.12, 95% confidence interval 0.62 to 2.02; 
I2=25%). We did not identify any studies of partially 
hydrolysed formula and diabetes nor of hydrolysed for-
mula and other autoimmune outcomes.
generalisability and study conduct
In 18 of 33 (55%) included studies reporting allergic 
outcomes, there were features suggesting issues with 
generalisability and possibly with study conduct.16  In 
seven studies there was either exclusive formula feed-
ing from birth in all randomised participants17-22  or 
total cessation of breastfeeding by 14 days.23  In five 
studies, randomisation and allocation of formula 
milk occurred early: during pregnancy,24  at birth in 
all25 26  or some27  participants, or in the first four days 
after birth in most participants.28  In one study, infants 
were enrolled on day one, and over half were exclu-
sively formula fed,29  and in another breast milk was 
purposefully withheld for the first three days of life in 
some infants.30  In two studies breastfeeding was not 
mentioned,31 32  and in another two studies33 34  it was 
unclear whether or not the study population was 
selected for a high rate of early formula feeding 
because of insufficient information in the report. The 
information presented in these studies suggests the 
possibility that more could have been done to pro-
mote the maintenance and revival of breastfeeding in 
the study populations, in accordance with the Inter-
national Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substi-
tutes.16  In the 15 remaining studies of allergic 
disease12 35-48  and in all diabetes studies47 49-52 there 
was no  
evidence of adverse breastfeeding outcomes in 
study participants.
discussion
Principal findings
In this systematic review of hydrolysed infant formula 
for reducing risk of allergic or autoimmune disease we 
found no consistent evidence to support a protective 
role for partially or extensively hydrolysed formula. Our 
findings conflict with current international guidelines, 
in which hydrolysed formula is widely recommended 
for young formula fed infants with a family history of 
allergic disease.5-10 Such recommendations might there-
fore need revision.
Comparison with other studies
In 1936, Grulee and Sanford suggested that formula 
feeding could be associated with eczema,3  and more 
recent studies suggest that infant exposure to intact 
cows’ milk might increase the risk of type 1 diabetes 
mellitus due to immunological cross reactivity 
between human and bovine insulin.4  Allergenic pep-
tides in milk are 10-40 kDa in size, and bovine insulin 
is 5.8 kDa; partially and extensively hydrolysed for-
mulas are intended to have no peptides >5 kDa and ≥3 
kDa, respectively.53 By the avoidance of exposure to 
insulin or allergenic peptides in milk with partially or 
extensively hydrolysed formula, one might in theory 
prevent immunological sensitisation to insulin or 
milk and associated diseases such as type 1 diabetes, 
milk allergy, and eczema. We did not, however, find 
consistent evidence from intervention trials to sup-
port this.
The infant feeding guidelines that recommend 
hydrolysed formula for allergy prevention recognise 
that the evidence base for such a recommendation is 
weak and informed by analysis of a small number of 
trials with high risk of bias. In the current 2006 
Cochrane review Osborn and colleagues concluded 
that there is limited evidence to support a role for 
hydrolysed formula in reducing allergy to cows’ milk 
and no evidence for other specific allergic out-
comes.9 10  This conclusion was based on a single 
study,21  in which the selected outcome is likely to be a 
poor measure of allergy to cows’ milk as it was 
reported in over 40% of the control group, and such 
allergy has a prevalence of 2-7.5%.54 In our current 
meta-analysis of three studies reporting allergy to 
cows’ milk, including data from the same study that

defined allergy to cows’ milk as challenge proved 
allergy with a positive allergy test result (3% preva-
lence in control group), we found no evidence to sup-
port the conclusion of the Cochrane review.
International guidelines also support the use of 
hydrolysed formula for high risk infants to prevent 
eczema.5-7  We found no consistent evidence to support 
this. We did find that studies of lower quality design 
(controlled clinical trials and quasi-randomised con-
trolled trials) had more positive outcomes than truly 
randomised controlled trials, and we found evidence 
of publication bias, suggesting that there could be 
small unpublished trials showing increased risk of 
eczema or recurrent wheeze associated with hydro-
lysed formula. The conclusions of an independent 
FDA review, which supported a limited health claim 
that a whey based partially hydrolysed formula (Good-
Start, Nestlé, Vevey, Switzerland) could reduce the risk 
of eczema in high risk infants, also do not seem to be 
justified.8  That approval was based largely on review 
of the findings of the GINI study, in which per protocol 
analysis rather than intention to treat analysis was 
used to inform the FDA decision as the intention to 
treat analysis had not yet been published.8  The health 
claim was also approved before publication of one 
trial of the same formula with significantly negative 
results.42 Our own meta-analysis of published ran-
domised controlled trials of the same partially hydro-
lysed formula does not support the FDA approved 
health claim that there is evidence for use of a whey 
based partially hydrolysed formula from birth to 4 
months for reducing risk of eczema in healthy infants 
who are not exclusively breastfed and have a family 
history of allergy.
strengths and limitations of the study
Many studies of allergic outcomes included in this 
review had unclear or high risk of bias and evidence 
of conflict of interest, often because of inadequate 
methods of randomisation and treatment allocation 
(selection bias) and support of the study or investiga-
tors from manufacturers of hydrolysed formula. In 
many cases study participants were infants with early 
full formula feeding, so our findings might not be 
applicable to populations with more typical feeding 
patterns.
Concerns have been raised about possible research 
fraud in this topic of investigation. We did not 
include the implicated studies, which evaluated a 
partially hydrolysed formula (Nan HA/Good Start/
Nidina HA/Beba HA, Nestlé, Vevey, Switzerland) for 
preventing allergic outcomes and were led by Chan-
dra and colleagues.55-57  Data from the Chandra stud-
ies played an important role in a 2003 Cochrane 
review, which concluded that hydrolysed formula 
reduces allergic disease.58 Subsequent systematic 
reviews have excluded the Chandra data. The evi-
dence of publication bias that we found, however, 
suggests that these systematic reviews might still 
overestimate the possibility that hydrolysed formula 
has beneficial effects.
Conclusions and policy implications
Our analyses suggest that current recommendations to 
use hydrolysed formula in place of standard cows’ milk 
formula to prevent allergy in infants at high risk should 
be revised. We found no consistent evidence to support 
the current recommendations and found evidence of 
publication bias, methodological biases, and conflict of 
interest in those studies reporting allergic outcomes. 
We suggest that any future trials on hydrolysed formula 
should be prospectively registered, independently 
funded, and include adequate oversight to ensure that 
they do not negatively impact on breastfeeding in study 
participants.
