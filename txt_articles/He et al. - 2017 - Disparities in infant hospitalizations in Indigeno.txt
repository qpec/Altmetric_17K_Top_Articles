ndigenous infants are at substantially higher risk of mortality 
than their non-Indigenous counterparts, even in developed 
countries such as Australia, the United States and Canada.1–7 
Infant mortality is merely a tip of the iceberg of infant morbidity. 
The high infant mortality rates suggest high risk of severe infant 
morbidities in Indigenous populations. Knowledge of these mor-
bidities is essential for developing intervention measures to reduce 
infant health inequalities. Population-based studies in the US and 
Australia have shown substantially higher rates of hospital admis-
sions (an indicator of severe infant morbidities) in Indigenous than 
in non-Indigenous infants.8–14 Likewise, we would expect substan-
tial disparities in Indigenous versus non-Indigenous infant hospital-
izations in Canada. Indigenous infants in Canada often live in com-
munities with poor access to high-quality care, and in communities 
and families with poor socioeconomic conditions that are strongly 
predictive of poor infant health.15 However, there is a lack of 
population 
-based data on infant morbidities or hospitalizations in 
Indigenous populations in Canada, and a lack of data on all-cause 
hospitalizations for Indigenous infants in most countries. 
Through population-based linkage of birth-infant hospitaliza-
tion records, in the present study we sought to assess disparities 
in infant hospitalizations in First Nations, Inuit and non-
Indigenous infants in Quebec, Canada. We also endeavoured to 
explore the factors that may explain these disparities.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Infant mortality is higher 
in Indigenous than non-Indigenous pop-
ulations, but comparable data on infant 
morbidity are lacking in Canada. We eval-
uated disparities in infant morbidities 
experienced by Indigenous populations 
in Canada. 
METHODS: We used linked population-
based birth and health administrative 
data from Quebec, Canada, to compare 
hospitalization rates, an indicator of 
severe morbidity, in First Nations, Inuit 
and non-Indigenous singleton infants 
(< 1 year) born between 1996 and 2010.
RESULTS: Our cohort included 19 770 
First Nations, 3930 Inuit and 225 380 non-
Indigenous infants. Compared with non-
Indigenous infants, all-cause hospitaliza-
tion rates were higher in First Nations 
infants (unadjusted risk ratio [RR] 2.05, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.99–2.11; 
fully adjusted RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.37–
1.50) and in Inuit infants (unadjusted RR 
1.96, 95% CI 1.87–2.05; fully adjusted RR 
1.37, 95% CI 1.24–1.52). Higher risks of 
hospitalization (accounting for multiple 
comparisons) were observed for First 
Nations infants in 12 of 16 disease cate-
gories and for Inuit infants in 7 of 16 dis-
ease categories. Maternal characteris-
tics (age, education, marital status, 
parity, rural residence and Northern 
residence) partly explained the risk ele-
vations, but maternal chronic illnesses 
and gestational complications had neg-
ligible influence overall. Acute bronchi-
olitis (risk difference v. non-Indigenous 
infants, First Nations 37.0 per 1000, 
Inuit 39.6 per 1000) and pneumonia 
(risk difference v. non-Indigenous 
infants, First Nations 41.2 per 1000, 
Inuit 61.3 per 1000) were the 2 leading 
causes of excess hospitalizations in 
Indigenous infants.
INTERPRETATION: First Nations and 
Inuit infants had substantially elevated 
burdens of hospitalizations as a result of 
diseases of multiple systems. The 
findings identify substantial unmet 
needs in disease prevention and medical 
care for Indigenous infants.

Indigenous births were identified based on 3 sources of informa-
tion: mother tongue, community of residence (according to resi-
dential postal code/municipality name) and Indian Registration 
System membership status of both parents (a positive in any Indig-
enous identifier was considered Indigenous).7 The original birth 
cohort included 20 190 First Nations, 4260 Inuit and 229 960 non-
Indigenous singleton births in Quebec, 1996–2010. The present 
study included all infants (19 770 First Nations, 3930 Inuit and 
225 380 non-Indigenous) whose medical insurance number (and, 
thus, hospitalization records) could be identified through probabi-
listic record linkage by mother’s first name, last name, date of birth 
and residential postal code; father’s first name, last name and date 
of birth; and infant’s sex, first name, last name and date of birth.
Pregnancy complications and infant hospitalizations (in the first 
365 days of life after birth) were based on hospital discharge records 
in the Maintenance et exploitation des données pour l’étude de la 
clientèle hospitalière database maintained at the Régie de 
l’assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ). In Quebec, universal medi-
cal insurance is available. Every resident is assigned a unique life-
time medical insurance (RAMQ) number. The RAMQ number was 
used to link delivery discharge records to the mothers with hospital-
ization records for the infants. The linkage to hospitalization records 
was successful for 19 770 First Nations (97.9%), 3930 Inuit (92.3%) 
and 225 380 non-Indigenous (98.0%) infants. Therefore, the final 
study cohort comprised 249 080 infants.
Pregnancy complications and causes of infant hospitaliza-
tions were coded by the International Classification of Diseases 
(ICD)-9 Clinical Modification codes for records in the years 1996–
2005, and ICD-10 codes for records in the years 2006–2010. The 
causes of infant hospitalizations were classified by ICD chapter.
Outcomes
The primary outcomes were infant hospitalizations during the 
first year (365 d) of life after birth. We tabulated hospitalizations

*Hospitalization rates presented are the numbers per 1000 infants who were hospitalized during the first year (365 d) of life after birth. Multiple admissions for different causes were 
treated as separate events, but multiple admissions for the same cause as one event. The denominator included all live-born infants. Bonferroni-adjusted 2-tailed p values < 0.0015 
were considered statistically significant, considering 34 primary comparisons of interest (overall and 16 ICD chapter cause–specific infant hospitalization rates comparing First Nations 
and Inuit to non-Indigenous groups, total = 34 primary comparisons).

due to all-cause and each specific ICD chapter morbidity cate-
gory. We also explored the top 10 specific infant morbidities to 
show the leading specific diseases for hospitalization to guide 
prevention strategies. Multiple admissions for different causes 
were treated as separate events, but multiple admissions for the 
same cause as one event.
Statistical analysis
We calculated crude rates of outcomes, and crude risk ratios (RRs) 
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to illustrate the relative dis-
parities. Risk differences were calculated to illustrate the absolute 
disparities. Log-binomial models were fitted to estimate the 
adjusted RRs with 95% CIs of outcomes accounting for cluster 
effects (multiple infants of the same mother) in generalized esti-
mating equations.16 We adjusted for available risk factors and 
potential confounders and examined the changes in the RRs to 
assess whether maternal characteristics (age, marital status, par-
ity, education, rural residence, and Northern residence based on 
postal code [in Canada, the North is characterized by poor socio-
economic conditions, remoteness and substantial barriers in 
access to high-quality health care]17,18), major chronic illnesses 
(pregestational diabetes, pre-existing hypertension, heart dis-
ease, renal disease, genitourinary infections), and gestational 
complications (gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension 
and preeclampsia, and anemia) may explain the risk disparities in 
infant hospitalizations comparing First Nations and Inuit to non-
Indigenous infants. We did not adjust for gestational age and birth 
weight, so as to avoid collider bias.19,20 All data analyses were car-
ried out using SAS, Version 9.2. Two-tailed p values < 0.0015 were 
considered statistically significant, considering 34 primary com-
parisons of interest (overall and 16 ICD chapter cause–specific 
infant hospitalization rates comparing First Nations and Inuit to non- 
Indigenous groups, total = 34 primary comparisons, Bonferroni-
adjusted p value cut-off = 0.05/34 = 0.0015).
Ethics approval
The study was approved by the research ethics board of Sainte-
Justine Hospital Research Centre. 
Results
Table 1 presents the characteristics of First Nations, Inuit and 
non-Indigenous births in the study cohort. First Nations and Inuit 
mothers were much younger. The proportion of mothers younger 
than 20 years was > 6 times higher in First Nations (21.9%) and 
Inuit (27.1%) than in non-Indigenous (3.3%) groups. First Nations 
and Inuit mothers were > 3 times more likely to be living alone, 
but less likely to be primiparous than non-Indigenous mothers. 
Average education levels were much lower in First Nations and 
Inuit than in non-Indigenous mothers. More than 40% of First 
Nations or Inuit mothers had not completed high school, versus 
about 10% in non-Indigenous mothers. Compared with non-
Indigenous mothers, First Nations and Inuit mothers had substan-
tially higher rates of major chronic illnesses (pre-existing hyper-
tension, pre-existing diabetes, renal disease and genitourinary 
infections) and gestational complications (anemia, gestational 
diabetes, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia). First 
Nations and Inuit mothers were less likely to deliver a small-for-
gestational-age (SGA; birth weight < 10th percentile, according to 
the Canadian sex- and gestational age–specific birth weight stan-
dards21) infant (3.8% and 5.4% v. 8.6%), but more likely to deliver 
a preterm (6.9% and 11.3% v. 6.3%) or large-for-gestational age 
(LGA; birth weight > 90th percentile) infant (25.0% and 13.9% v. 
9.10%), respectively, than non-Indigenous mothers.
All-cause infant hospitalization rates were substantially 
higher in both First Nations (329.8 per 1000) and Inuit (315.7 per 
1000) versus non-Indigenous (160.5 per 1000) infants; the RRs 
were 2.05 (95% CI 1.99–2.11) and 1.96 (1.87–2.05), respectively 
(all p < 0.0001) (Table 2). Infant hospitalization rates trended 
lower in all 3 groups, but the relative disparities persisted and 
did not diminish over time (Figure 1).
Compared with non-Indigenous infants, First Nations and 
Inuit infants were at higher risks of hospitalization as a result of 
infections (RR 2.09 and 1.82, respectively), injuries/accidents 
(1.51 and 1.68), congenital anomalies (1.52 and 1.47) and dis-
eases of respiratory (2.64 and 2.74), digestive (1.74 and 1.30), ner-
vous (1.79 and 1.98) and endocrine (2.83 and 3.46) systems, skin 
and subcutaneous tissue (6.13 and 4.84) and undefined symp-
toms (1.47 and 1.88) (p < 0.0001 in most comparisons). First 
Nations infants were also at higher risks of hospitalization result-
ing from diseases of musculoskeletal (RR 2.35), circulatory (RR 
1.71) and genitourinary (RR 1.62) systems (Table 2). Infections 
and respiratory system diseases were the top 2 major morbidity 
categories in all 3 study groups. The absolute risk differences 
were much larger for infant hospitalizations resulting from infections

respectively; the corresponding numbers comparing Inuit versus non-
Indigenous infants were 1.93 (1.85–2.01), 1.99 (1.90–2.04) and 1.94 (1.88–
2.00), respectively (Breslow–Day test for homogeneity of RRs across year

and respiratory system disorders than other morbidity catego-
ries. Comparing First Nations and Inuit versus non-Indigenous 
infants, there were 70–80 more hospitalizations per 1000 infants 
for respiratory system disorders, and 30–40 more hospitaliza-
tions per 1000 infants for infections.
Tables 3 and 4 present the stepwise adjusted RRs of infant 
hospitalization comparing First Nations or Inuit to non-
Indigenous infants. Compared with the crude RRs in Table 2, 
there were only small changes (< 10%) in the RRs of most out-
comes adjusted for mother-level cluster effects only. Further 
adjustment for maternal characteristics (age, education, marital 
status, parity and rural residence) decreased the RRs substan-
tially for all-cause infant hospitalization, from 1.97 to 1.46 for 
First Nations infants, and from 1.89 to 1.40 for Inuit infants. Simi-
larly, the adjustment for maternal characteristics attenuated the 
Indigenous versus non-Indigenous risk disparities in infant hospi-
talizations due to most causes. However, the RRs for infant hos-
pitalization due to all-cause and most specific morbidity catego-
ries comparing First Nations or Inuit to non-Indigenous infants 
showed few (< 10%) additional changes when further adjust-
ments were made for maternal chronic illnesses (pre-existing 
hypertension, pre-existing diabetes, heart disease, renal disor-
ders and genitourinary infections) or gestational complications 
(gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension and preeclamp-
sia, anemia). There were virtually no changes in all the RRs when 
further adjustment was made for infant sex and mode of delivery 
(data not shown).
The top 10 most frequent specific diseases leading to infant 
hospitalizations are presented in Table 5. The top 2 major spe-
cific diseases contributing to the excess infant hospitalizations in 
First Nations and Inuit versus non-Indigenous infants were acute 
bronchiolitis (64.6 and 67.2 v. 27.6 per 1000) and pneumonia (47.9 
and 68.0 v. 6.7 per 1000), respectively. The absolute risk differ-
ences showed that there were about 36 to 61 more hospitaliza-
tions per 1000 infants for acute bronchiolitis or pneumonia for 
First Nations or Inuit infants than non-Indigenous infants. In con-
trast, the absolute risk differences for hospitalization due to any 
other specific disease were much smaller.
Interpretation
We found that First Nations and Inuit infants suffered a substan-
tially elevated risk of hospitalization as a result of diseases of 
multiple systems. The higher hospitalization rates could be 
partly due to the higher underlying severe morbidity rates, and 
partly to inadequate medical care of less severe diseases (e.g., 
delays in diagnosis or treatment) progressing to more severe dis-
eases requiring hospitalization. 
The leading causes of the excess infant hospitalizations in First 
Nations and Inuit infants were infectious and respiratory system 
diseases, for the most part (Table 5). The excess risks of these dis-
eases may be related to infant immunization and the quality of the 
living environment, and thus may be largely preventable, suggesting 
the need to improve infant immunization programs, promote

breastfeeding and no smoking in the child’s living environment, 
and improve living conditions in Indigenous communities.
The factors that may explain the excess risks of hospitaliza-
tion in First Nations and Inuit infants are not yet fully under-
stood. Maternal characteristics could partly explain these risk dif-
ferences. Unmeasured risk factors, especially maternal smoking 
and alcohol use, may also contribute. It is known that smoking 
and alcohol use are much more frequent among Indigenous pop-
ulations.22,23 The adverse effects of alcohol and tobacco on the 
developing fetus are well known.24–26 Smoking and alcohol use 
may result in more unhealthy fetuses, contributing to elevated 
risks of multiple infant morbidities in First Nations and Inuit 
infants. Another unmeasured risk factor is the quality of perinatal 
care. Indeed, a recent study found poorer quality of obstetric 
care in First Nations versus other pregnant women in British 
Columbia.27 Poor housing conditions, financial and food insecu-
rity, and stress might be contributing factors.
Unexpectedly, pregnancy complications could not explain the 
excess infant hospitalizations in Indigenous populations. 
Although all major pregnancy complications were much more 
common in First Nations and Inuit women, the overall effects of 
adjusting for these pregnancy complications hardly diminished 
the hospitalization risk disparities between First Nations and 
Inuit versus non-Indigenous infants (Table 3, Table 4).
Our and other studies have consistently reported worse birth 
outcomes and higher perinatal and infant mortality rates in First 
Nations and Inuit versus non-Indigenous populations in Can-
ada.4–7 The present study further shows that First Nations and 
Inuit peoples may bear a disproportionately greater burden of 
severe infant morbidities than non-Indigenous populations in 
Quebec, as shown by the much higher infant hospitalization 
rates. We are aware of only 2 previous studies on Canadian 
Indigenous infant hospitalizations, both with important limita-
tions.28,29 A study in 2007 reported higher rates of infant hospital-
ization due to pneumonia in Indigenous versus non-Indigenous 
communities in the Northern Peninsula of Newfoundland based 
on place of residence only to identify Indigenous infants.28 A 
small cohort study (First Nations infants, n = 99) reported 4 times 
greater risk of hospitalization in First Nations than in non-
Indigenous infants in southern Ontario.29
Strengths and limitations
The main strength is the population-based large birth cohort with 
linked data on infant hospitalizations. One limitation is that mis-
classifications of Indigenous status might have occurred. In Que-
bec, Indigenous peoples numbered about 142 000 in the 2011 cen-
sus, accounting for only about 2.1% of the total provincial 
population. In this study, we could identify First Nations and Inuit 
infants, but not Métis infants since no identifiers were available. 
Métis infants would have been classified as “non-Indigenous.” 
However, this limitation should not have affected the compari-
sons, because the number of Métis infants in the “non-Indige-
nous” group is very small (Métis accounted for about 0.5% of the 
total Quebec population in the 2011 census). Inuit infants were 
slightly less likely to be linked to hospital records, possibly due to 
some home births in low-risk pregnancies. Such unlinked Inuit 
infants might thus be at lower risk for hospitalization, leading to 
somewhat overestimated risk for Inuit infants overall. 
Another limitation is our inability to determine whether the 
decision to hospitalize an infant was influenced by factors other 
than the infant’s clinical conditions. However, hospital care 
might have been more accessible to non-Indigenous infants. 
Thus, the observed disparities might underestimate the true dis-
parities in severe morbidities between Indigenous and non-
Indigenous infants. 
The study was based on infant hospitalization data in the 
province of Quebec. There is a need for studies in other prov-
inces to understand the generalizability of the findings and 
depict the national picture of Indigenous versus non-Indigenous 
risk disparities in Canada. We suspect that similar risk patterns 
may be observed in other provinces with similar social and 
health care contexts.
Conclusion
First Nations and Inuit infants suffered a substantially heavier 
burden of hospitalizations resulting from diseases of multiple 
systems in Quebec. Preventable morbidities accounted for the 
major excess risks. The findings identify substantial unmet needs 
in Indigenous infant disease prevention and medical care. There 
is an urgent need for interventions to reduce Indigenous versus 
non-Indigenous infant health inequalities.
