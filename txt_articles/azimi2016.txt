Abstract 
23 
Previous research has shown that desktop 3D printers can emit large numbers of ultrafine 
24 
particles (UFPs: particles less than 100 nm) and some hazardous volatile organic compounds 
25 
(VOCs) during printing, although very few filament and 3D printer combinations have been 
26 
tested to date. Here we quantify emissions of UFPs and speciated VOCs from 5 commercially 
27 
available filament extrusion desktop 3D printers utilizing up to 9 different filaments using 
28 
controlled experiments in a test chamber. Median estimates of time-varying UFP emission rates 
29 
ranged from ~108 to ~1011 #/min across all tested combinations, varying primarily by filament 
30 
material and, to a lesser extent, bed temperature. The individual VOCs emitted in the largest 
31 
quantities included: caprolactam from nylon-based and imitation wood and brick filaments 
32 
(ranging ~2 to ~180 µg/min), styrene from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and high-
33 
impact polystyrene (HIPS) filaments (ranging ~10 to ~110 µg/min), and lactide from polylactic 
34 
acid (PLA) filaments (ranging ~4 to ~5 µg/min). Results from a screening analysis of the 
35 
potential exposures to these products in a typical small office environment suggest caution 
36 
should be used when operating many of the printer and filament combinations in poorly 
37 
ventilated spaces or without the aid of combined gas and particle filtration systems.

1. Introduction 
44 
Desktop three-dimensional (3D) printers are rapidly increasing in popularity. The majority of 
45 
commercially available desktop 3D printers designed for the consumer market utilize an additive 
46 
manufacturing technology called fused filament fabrication (FFF), also known as fused 
47 
deposition modeling (FDM) or molten polymer deposition (MPD). In the FFF process, a solid 
48 
thermoplastic filament is forced through a heated extrusion nozzle, melted, and deposited in thin 
49 
layers onto a moving bed.1,2 A three-dimensional solid shape is formed layer-by-layer as the 
50 
filament material cools and hardens. A wide variety of filament materials are now being used in 
51 
desktop FFF 3D printers, including acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA), 
52 
polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polycarbonate (PC), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), high-impact 
53 
polystyrene (HIPS), nylon, and many other polymers, metals, ceramics, and other materials.3 
54 
Filaments are melted at a variety of extruder nozzle temperatures and bed temperatures, and 
55 
manufacturers typically recommend ranges of optimal temperatures for each filament material 
56 
and thickness. ABS and PLA are currently the most commonly used filaments in desktop 3D 
57 
printers, although others are also gaining popularity.4  
58 
It is well known that both gases and particles are emitted during thermal processing of many 
59 
thermoplastic materials.5,6 However, little is known about the types and magnitudes of emissions 
60 
from desktop FFF 3D printers and how they vary according to filament material or printer 
61 
characteristics. In 2013, we published the first known measurements of emissions of ultrafine 
62 
particles (UFPs: particles less than 100 nm in diameter) resulting from the operation of a single 
63 
make and model of a commercially available desktop FFF 3D printer using both ABS and PLA 
64 
filaments.7 These findings were crucial, as exposure to emissions from thermal decomposition of 
65 
thermoplastics has been shown to have toxic effects in animals8–10 and exposure to UFPs from 
66

4
other sources have been linked to a variety of adverse human health effects.11–17 We are aware of 
67 
only one other published study to date that has investigated emissions from extrusion-based 
68 
desktop 3D printers. Kim et al. (2015) measured emissions of particles, total volatile organic 
69 
compounds (TVOCs), several aldehydes and phthalates, and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and 
70 
m-,p-xylene (BTEX) from two different FFF printers operating in a small chamber, again using 
71 
both ABS and PLA filaments.18 They confirmed that particle emissions were higher for printers 
72 
utilizing ABS filaments compared to PLA filaments, and also demonstrated higher VOC 
73 
emissions from the printers using ABS filaments compared to PLA.  
74 
Despite these two studies, important gaps in our knowledge of emissions from 3D printers 
75 
still remain. Only a very limited number of makes and models of printers have been tested to 
76 
date, and even fewer filament materials have been characterized for gas and/or particle emissions 
77 
(i.e., only ABS and PLA). Further, we hypothesize that Kim et al. (2015) may have missed some 
78 
individual VOCs that are emitted when using some filaments because they were not specifically 
79 
targeted or identified using a mass spectral library compound search. We also have no 
80 
information to date on how the design or shape of printed materials, or how printer 
81 
characteristics such as the presence of enclosures, may influence gas and/or particle emissions.  
82 
Therefore, we advance these previous studies by quantifying emission rates of particles and a 
83 
broad range of speciated VOCs from 5 popular commercially available desktop FFF 3D printers 
84 
utilizing as many as 9 different filaments to print standardized test objects in a medium-sized test 
85 
chamber. We use the results to explore differences in particle and VOC emissions based on 
86 
filament material and printer characteristics. We also provide preliminary data on the impact of 
87 
print object geometry and the use of a partial enclosure.

2. Experimental Methods 
89 
2.1. Emissions testing procedure 
90 
All measurements were conducted inside a 3.6 m3 stainless steel chamber with a small 
91 
stainless steel mixing fan operating, as described in the SI (Figure S1). Each printer was 
92 
connected to a desktop computer located outside the chamber. Before each experiment began, 
93 
filtered supply air was delivered to the chamber at a constant ventilation rate of approximately 1 
94 
hr-1 for a period of at least 8 hours to achieve initial steady-state background conditions. The 3D 
95 
printer beds were prepared for printing before sealing the chamber by wiping with isopropyl 
96 
alcohol, or, in some cases, depending on the printer and filament combination, by applying small 
97 
amounts of adhesive from glue sticks following manufacturer recommendations. The printer was 
98 
then powered on and began printing a small object.  
99 
For all tests but one, we printed a 10×10×1 cm standardized sample from the National 
100 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), as shown in Figure 1.19 The sample was chosen 
101 
because it was developed as a standardized test part to evaluate the performance of additive 
102 
manufacturing technologies and it has a range of features that were thought to potentially 
103 
influence dynamic printer emissions, including a combination of solid volumes, thin protrusions, 
104 
holes, and indentations. We also repeated one test with a single printer and filament combination 
105 
printing a ~195 cm3 cube of approximately the same printing duration as the NIST sample, 
106 
allowing for an evaluation of the impact of print object shape on emissions. Nozzle and bed 
107 
warm-up periods typically lasted between 5 and 10 minutes depending on the printer and 
108 
filament and the printing time varied from 2.5 to 4 hours depending on the combination of 
109 
printer, filament, and object shape.

113 
2.2. Air sampling and analysis 
114 
Particle concentrations were continuously measured inside the exhaust port of the chamber 
115 
using a TSI Model 3007 Condensation Particle Counter (CPC) logging at 1-minute intervals. The 
116 
CPC was located inside an external exhaust hood and connected to the chamber exhaust port by a 
117 
0.9 m long piece of conductive tubing 0.6 cm in diameter. The CPC measures the total number 
118 
concentrations of particles between 10 nm and 1 µm with a reported maximum concentration of 
119 
105 #/cm3 and a sample flow rate of 0.7 L/min. Particle concentrations were measured during all 
120 
phases of the experiment, beginning with the last 45-60 minutes of background measurements, 
121 
spanning the 2.5-4 hour print period (which includes the 5-10 minute warm-up phase), and 
122 
ending with a final ~3-hour decay period during which particle concentrations were allowed to 
123 
decrease towards background concentrations with the printer off.   
124 
We should note that although the measurement range of the CPC is 10 nm to 1 µm, the vast 
125 
majority of particles emitted from most FFF printers were assumed to be in the UFP size range, 
126 
as demonstrated by preliminary data in the SI (Figure S4).7,18 Thus, we consider these 
127 
measurements largely representative of UFPs and use this nomenclature from here on. We 
128 
periodically calibrated the CPC used for the chamber measurements using co-location 
129 
measurements with a TSI Model 3910 NanoScan Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) that 
130 
Page 7 of 29
ACS Paragon Plus Environment
Environmental Science & Technology
  
7
had been recently calibrated by the manufacturer. We considered the SMPS to be the most 
131 
accurate for UFP measurements, but it was not available for use during all of the tests. Thus, we 
132 
calibrated the CPC to the SMPS using a polynomial regression from these periodic co-location 
133 
experiments. The calibration between CPC particle counts and total UFP counts from the SMPS 
134 
(Figure S2) was nearly linear throughout the manufacturer-reported measurement range of the 
135 
CPC (up to 105 #/cm3) but increased exponentially beyond this range, as is typical for this 
136 
instrument.20 This was important to account for because several of the highest UFP emitters 
137 
yielded raw CPC concentrations greater than 105 #/cm3 in the experimental chamber. 
138 
Chamber air was also sampled during the tests for VOC analysis using Tenax-GR sorbent 
139 
tubes during two periods: once during the last ~45 minutes prior to printing (with a printer in the 
140 
chamber but not powered on or operating), and again during the last ~45 minutes of printing 
141 
after VOC concentrations reached approximately steady state. We used the differences in 
142 
concentrations between the two samples to estimate emission rates for both speciated VOCs and 
143 
for the sum of the 10 highest detectable VOCs (i.e., ΣVOC). Total VOC (TVOC) concentrations 
144 
inside the chamber were also continuously measured during a subset of experiments using a TSI 
145 
Q-Trak Model 7575 Indoor Air Quality Monitor with a Model 982 photo-ionization detection 
146 
(PID) probe to verify that TVOC concentrations achieved approximately steady state by the time 
147 
air sampling for VOC analysis was conducted. These measurements were used to verify that 
148 
approximately steady state conditions were typically achieved within 2 hours from the beginning 
149 
of printing and that TVOC emissions followed a characteristic constant emission rate profile 
150 
(Figure S3). Thus we consider air sampling for VOC analysis during the final 45 minutes of 
151 
printing each object reasonably representative of steady-state concentrations.  
152

The procedure for sampling and analyzing the sorbent tubes was based on a modified version 
153 
of U.S. EPA Method TO-17.21 Sorbent tubes were inserted into a small hole in the exhaust port 
154 
of the chamber and connected to a Buck VSS-1 low-flow air sampling pump located outside of 
155 
the chamber operating at ~20 mL/min. Airflow rates of the sampling pumps and tubes were 
156 
measured after each test using a Gilian Gilibrator 2 and combined with the recorded sampling 
157 
duration to estimate the total air volume passed through the tubes during sampling. All sorbent 
158 
tubes were shipped in a freezer pack overnight to the University of Texas at Austin and analyzed 
159 
using thermal desorption followed by gas chromatograph and electron ionization mass 
160 
spectrometry (TD/GC/MS). An internal standard, 4-Bromoflourobenzene (BFB), was used for all 
161 
analysis. Individual VOCs were statistically identified and quantified using a NIST Library 
162 
Compound Search (LCS). The mass of the identified compounds was estimated using the 
163 
response of the internal standard and a relative response factor of one. The majority of the 
164 
uncertainty associated with these calculations is related to the assumption that the relative 
165 
response factor is one. Relative response factors for this method have been shown to commonly 
166 
range from approximately 0.75 to 1.25 for most VOCs,22 thus we use 25% as an approximate 
167 
estimate of the uncertainty in our VOC quantification method. Individual VOCs may not have 
168 
the same response factors, but this provides a reasonable base estimate of the uncertainty in the 
169 
reported concentrations. 
170 
We also sampled for VOCs outside of the chamber during several tests. These sorbent 
171 
samples were taken during the entire printing period to ensure that there were no unexpected 
172 
external sources of VOCs transported into the chamber. Blank sorbent tubes were also collected 
173 
outside the chamber without connecting them to the air pumps during each test to characterize 
174 
adsorption of any unexpected compounds during shipping and storage. Finally, temperature and 
175 
Page 9 of 29

9
relative humidity (RH) were measured during each test using an Onset HOBO U12 data logger 
176 
recording at 1-minute intervals, and ventilation rates were measured during each test using CO2 
177 
as a tracer gas. CO2 was injected from a small tank into the chamber at the beginning of each test 
178 
and the subsequent decay of chamber CO2 concentrations was measured using a PP Systems 
179 
SBA-5 CO2 monitor connected to an Onset HOBO U12 data logger, also recording at 1-minute 
180 
intervals. The ventilation rate calculation procedure is described in full in the SI. 
181 
2.3. UFP emission rate estimation 
182 
Because there was a large amount of scatter in the resulting UFP concentration data, we first 
183 
applied a smoothing function to the UFP data using the ‘smooth’ function in MATLAB R2015a, 
184 
as described in the SI. These smoothed concentration data were then used to estimate the time-
185 
varying UFP emission rate for each printer and filament combination using a discrete solution to 
186 
a dynamic well-mixed number balance applied on the total particle number concentrations 
187 
measured inside the chamber, as shown in Equation 1 and derived in the SI. 
188

where ������� is the time-varying UFP emission rate from a single 3D printer at time �

192 
chamber prior to emissions testing. ���� was estimated using a log-linear regression with the 
193 
first 60 minutes of data from the final decay period after printing finished, as described in the SI. 
194 
We should note that Equation 1 makes several important assumptions that may lead to 
195 
inaccuracies in estimates of UFP emission rates such as ignoring size-resolved particle dynamics, 
196 
ignoring coagulation, and assuming constant particle loss rates. Potential impacts of these 
197

10
assumptions are discussed in more detail in the SI. We estimate the uncertainty in our time-
198 
varying UFP emission rate calculations to be approximately 45%, as described in the SI. 
199 
The time-varying UFP emission rate estimates were also used to quantify the total number of 
200 
UFPs emitted during printing, normalized by the mass of filament used, as shown in Equation 2.

203 
used (i.e., the mass of the final printed object) (g). 
204 
2.4. VOC emission rate estimation 
205 
The TD/GC/MS library compound searches (LCS) identified and quantified approximately 
206 
50 speciated VOCs inside the chamber during the initial background periods and the last ~45 
207 
minutes of the printing periods. The emission rate of each identified VOC was estimated using 
208 
Equation 3, which assumes that ventilation was the only removal mechanism in the chamber, that 
209 
the concentrations of top 10 measured emitted VOCs from 3D printers were negligible outside 
210 
the chamber (verified by measurements), and that VOC concentrations achieved steady state 
211 
during the final sampling period. These assumptions are discussed in more detail in the SI. 
212 
����,� = �����,�,����� − ����,� ,�����

where ����,� is the estimated constant emission rate of an individual VOC (µg/min), ����,�,�����

214 
minutes of printing (µg/m3), and ����,� ,�� is the background concentration of an individual VOC 
215 
inside the chamber prior to printing (µg/m3). We estimate the uncertainty in our speciated VOC 
216 
emission rate calculations to be approximately 36%, as described in the SI. 
217

11
The emission rate of each printer for the sum of the 10 highest detectable VOCs (i.e., ΣVOC) 
218 
was estimated by adding all positive individual VOC emission rates of the top 10 compounds 
219 
with the highest concentrations inside the chamber during the last 45 minutes of the printing 
220 
period. We limited to the top 10 highest concentration compounds because compounds below the 
221 
top 10 added negligible amounts to the overall detectable ΣVOCi mass. We also normalized 
222 
ΣVOC emission rates by the mass of filament consumed using Equation 4.

where ����� is the total VOC emission rate of a printer for the top 10 identified compounds and 
224 
������ is the total VOC emission rate per mass of filament used (µg/g).  
225 
2.5. Printer and filament descriptions 
226 
We characterized UFP and VOC emissions from a total of 16 unique combinations of 
227 
printers and filaments, including five popular commercially available makes and models of 
228 
desktop 3D printers with up to nine different filament materials. The five printers included: (1) a 
229 
FlashForge Creator dual extruder model compatible with ABS and PLA (both filaments were 
230 
tested); (2) a Dremel 3D Idea Builder compatible with PLA only; (3) an XYZprinting da Vinci 
231 
1.0 compatible with ABS only; (4) a MakerBot Replicator 2X compatible with ABS only; and 
232 
(5) a LulzBot Mini that was compatible with many different types of filaments. The LulzBot 
233 
printer was tested with nine different filaments that are commonly used, including ABS, PLA, 
234 
high impact polystyrene (HIPS), semitransparent nylon, laybrick (an imitation brick material of 
235 
unknown chemical composition), laywood (an imitation wood material of unknown chemical 
236 
composition), transparent polycarbonate, a semitransparent nylon-based plasticized copolyamide 
237 
thermoplastic elastomer (PCTPE), and a transparent polyester resin filament called T-Glase. The 
238 
Dremel, XYZprinting, and MakerBot all had built-in plastic enclosures surrounding the 
239

12
apparatus (although they were not airtight), while the FlashForge and LulzBot did not have any 
240 
enclosures. This list of printers is not meant to be exhaustive, but it is designed to span a 
241 
reasonable range of currently popular printers with relatively generalizable characteristics such 
242 
as filament type, nozzle and bed temperatures, and the presence or lack of a partial enclosure.

246 
§ Experimental conditions with duplicate UFP emissions tests 
247 
ǂ Experiments with simultaneous VOC sampling conducted outside of the chamber 
248 
 
249 
Fifteen of the 16 printer and filament combinations were used to print the NIST test part, 
250 
while one test combination (LulzBot-ABS) was also used to print a cube. The MakerBot with 
251 
ABS filament was also tested twice: once with the plastic enclosure from the manufacturer 
252 
installed as received from the factory and once with the enclosure intentionally removed. We 
253

13
also performed duplicate VOC measurements for four printer and filament combinations and two 
254 
duplicate UFP measurements to evaluate the repeatability of our experiments. 
255 
 
256 
3. Results and Discussion 
257 
3.1. UFP emission rates 
258 
Figure 2a shows an example of time-varying UFP concentrations resulting from just one test 
259 
using one of the printers with ABS filament (LulzBot Mini), along with the smoothed fit to the 
260 
UFP concentration data. The left guideline in Figure 2a shows the moment that printers began 
261 
warming up prior to printing, which we considered part of the printing emissions period. Figure 
262 
2b shows the time-varying UFP emission rates estimated using Equation 1. Figures S6-S23 show 
263 
similar time-series profiles of both UFP concentrations and emission rates for all 16 
264 
experimental combinations, as well as two duplicate. 
265 
 
266 
Figure 2. (a) Calibrated and smoothed UFP concentrations and (b) estimates of the time-varying UFP 
267 
emission rates for one example test condition using a LulzBot Mini 3D printer and ABS filament. “SM” refers 
268 
to the data smoothing method utilized. 
269 
  
270 
Results in Figure 2a are similar to results from most of the experiments in that UFP 
271 
concentrations typically rapidly increased just after printing began and persisted for the first 10-
272 
20 minutes, then decreased to a lower level, albeit typically to a level that was still higher than 
273

14
the background concentration. During some tests with other printer and filament combinations, 
274 
UFP concentrations peaked again near the end of the print period as the thin protrusions on the 
275 
printed object were created. However, the magnitude and shape of dynamic UFP concentrations 
276 
varied widely depending on the printer, filament, shape of printed object, and nozzle and bed 
277 
temperatures. In a few scenarios (e.g., Figure 2a), UFP concentrations reached an approximate 
278 
steady state level toward the end of printing period. We used data from these periods to verify 
279 
that the discretized time-varying emission rate calculation method (Equation 1) also yielded 
280 
similar estimates of UFP emission rates as the simple steady state solution to the mass balance, 
281 
as described in the SI. Results from both solution methods were in good agreement for these 
282 
periods, suggesting that the dynamic solution method provides reasonable emission rate 
283 
estimates. 
284 
Figure 3 shows the range of time-varying UFP emission rates estimated for all 16 printer and 
285 
filament combinations, grouped by (i) ABS filaments, (ii) PLA filaments, and (iii) all filaments 
286 
other than ABS or PLA.

combinations. Each data point represents data from 1-minute intervals and the combination of data points

291 
percentile values with the 50th percentile (median) in between. Whiskers represent upper and lower adjacent 
292 
values and circles represent outliers beyond those values. 
293

 UFP emission rates varied substantially depending on the make and model of the printer, the 
294 
type of filament material, nozzle and bed temperatures, and the time of printing. The highest 
295 
UFP emission rates typically occurred with the printers utilizing ABS filaments, with median 
296 
values ranging from ~2×1010 to ~9×1010 #/min across all ABS printers with or without 
297 
enclosures. The lowest UFP emission rates occurred with the three printers utilizing PLA 
298 
filaments, regardless of printer make and model, with median UFP emission rates of ~108 #/min. 
299 
This was lower than what we estimated in our original study using a different make and model 
300 
printer as well as a different study design,7 but similar to other recent chamber tests.18 Median 
301 
UFP emission rates for the other filaments were highest with the polycarbonate filament 
302 
(~4×1010 #/min), followed by PCTPE (~2×1010 #/min), TGlase (~5×109 #/min), HIPS (~4×109 
303 
#/min), nylon (~2×108 #/min), laywood (~8×107 #/min), and laybrick (~6×107 #/min), all printed 
304 
using the LulzBot Mini printer. 
305 
Printing a cube instead of the NIST test part with ABS filament (in the LulzBot printer) did 
306 
not meaningfully alter the magnitude of UFP emission rates, although it did slightly change the 
307 
time-varying shape of the UFP emissions profile (Figure S8). Interestingly, the presence of an 
308 
enclosure only moderately reduced UFP emission rates from the MakerBot-ABS combination, 
309 
with a ~35% reduction in the median emission rate (although this variation is within the estimate 
310 
of uncertainty). Larger reductions were not observed perhaps because the enclosure was not 
311 
completely sealed and large gaps were visible. While these two comparisons provide preliminary 
312 
data on how printed shape and the presence of an enclosure may impact particle emissions from 
313 
3D printers, no other definitive conclusions can be drawn given this limited dataset. Finally, data 
314 
from two sets of duplicate tests (Figures S6-7 and S17-18) also demonstrated that there is some 
315 
Page 16 of 29
ACS Paragon Plus Environment
Environmental Science & Technology
  
16
inherent variability in UFP emissions between repeated tests, as median emission rate estimates 
316 
from these comparisons were within 57% and 48% of each other, respectively. 
317 
3.2. VOC emission rates 
318 
Figure 4 summarizes estimates of individual speciated VOC and ΣVOC emission rates from 
319 
each of the 16 printer and filament combinations. Only the top three speciated VOCs with the 
320 
highest concentrations measured in each test are shown individually, while the remaining top-10 
321 
individual VOCs are summarized as “other” VOCs. The sum of these yields an estimate of the 
322 
ΣVOC emission rate. We also provide a list of the top 10 individual VOCs with the highest 
323 
measured concentrations during the printing periods for all 16 experimental combinations inside 
324 
the chamber and four duplicate experiments for VOC sampling in Table S2, as well as during 
325 
four periods of VOC sampling outside the chamber in Table S3. 
326 
 
327 
Figure 4. Estimates of emission rates for the top three highest concentration VOCs as well as sum of the top 
328 
10 detectable VOCs (i.e., ΣVOC) resulting from the operation of 16 3D printer and filament combinations. 
329 
The figure is divided into (a) low emitters with EΣVOC < 40 µg/min and (b) high emitters with EΣVOC > 40 
330 
µg/min for visual clarity.  Note that although no error bars are shown in the figure, we estimate the 
331 
uncertainty in each individual VOC emission rate to be ~36% as described in the SI.  
332 
 
333 
Filament material drove the majority of differences in the types of VOCs emitted, while 
334 
printer make and model drove the majority of differences in the overall mass of VOCs emitted 
335

17
with the same filament. Estimates of total VOC emission rates (i.e., EΣVOC) ranged from as low as 
336 
~3 µg/min for the polycarbonate filament to nearly 200 µg/min for the nylon filament (both 
337 
printed using the LulzBot). The top three highest emitted compounds accounted for at least 70% 
338 
of ΣVOC emissions in all cases. For most of the printer and filament combinations, a single 
339 
VOC dominated the ΣVOC emissions.  
340 
The primary individual VOC emitted from all six ABS filament and printer combinations and 
341 
the only HIPS filament tested was styrene. Estimates of styrene emission rates with these 
342 
filaments ranged from ~12 µg/min to ~113 µg/min, depending on the printer make and model. 
343 
Interestingly, both the lowest and highest styrene emission rates were measured using printers 
344 
with a partial enclosure (i.e., XYZprinting and MakerBot). Both styrene and total VOC emission 
345 
rates were slightly lower when the LulzBot-ABS combination printed a cube compared to the 
346 
standard NIST test part, but they were actually slightly higher for the MakerBot-ABS 
347 
combination with the plastic enclosure compared to results without the enclosure.  
348 
The primary individual VOC emitted from the nylon, PCTPE, laybrick, and laywood 
349 
filaments was caprolactam. All of these filaments were installed in the LulzBot printer and all 
350 
were classified as “high emitters” in Figure 4b, with caprolactam emission rates as high as ~180 
351 
µg/min for the nylon filament. Caprolactam was also emitted from the polycarbonate and T-
352 
Glase filaments installed in the LulzBot printer, albeit at much lower levels (Figure 4a). Finally, 
353 
the primary individual VOC emitted from PLA filaments was lactide (1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione, 
354 
3,6-dimethyl), albeit at relatively low quantities, with emission rates ranging from ~4 µg/min to 
355 
~5 µg/min in the three printers using PLA filaments. We are confident that the majority of the 
356 
identified VOCs originated from the filament materials for most of the printer tests, even for the 
357 
tests that had glue applied to the bed, because the main components measured during the glue-
358

18
only test (propylene glycol and glycerin, as shown in Table S2) were only found in one 
359 
filament/printer combination in Figure 4. 
360 
3.3. Impacts of nozzle and bed temperatures 
361 
Next, we explored our estimates of both UFP and ΣVOC emission rates as a function of both 
362 
nozzle temperatures and bed temperatures (Figure 5). The mean UFP and ΣVOC emission rates 
363 
are split into three groups of bed temperature (less than 45°C, 60-65°C, and 100-110°C) and 
364 
plotted versus nozzle temperature (which varied from 190°C to 270°C, as described in Table 1). 
365 
 
366 
Figure 5. Impact of nozzle and bed temperature on mean UFP and TVOC emission rates 
367 
 
368 
Nozzle temperatures did not have a large influence on UFP emission rates from this set of 
369 
printers at either low bed temperatures or high bed temperatures. However, nozzle temperatures 
370 
did appear to influence UFP emission rates at mid-range bed temperatures, as UFP emission 
371 
rates were higher with increased nozzle temperatures. More importantly, bed temperatures alone 
372 
appeared to influence UFP emission rates in this sample of printers. Most of the printer/filament 
373 
combinations with the highest bed temperatures had the highest UFP emission rates while most 
374 
of the printer/filament combinations with the lowest bed temperatures had the lowest UFP 
375 
emission rates. There was no apparent relationship observed between ΣVOC emission rates and 
376 
Page 19 of 29
ACS Paragon Plus Environment
Environmental Science & Technology
  
19
either bed or nozzle temperatures across this sample of printers and filaments. However, we 
377 
should note that with this limited sample size, these relationships are only considered suggestive. 
378 
3.4. Correlations between total UFP and ΣVOC emissions per mass of filament 
379 
Figure 6 compares the total number of UFPs emitted (Equation 2) and the ΣVOC mass 
380 
emitted (Equation 4) during printing, normalized by the mass of filament, for each of the 16 
381 
primary printer and filament combinations. 
382 
 
383 
Figure 6. Comparison of total UFP and TVOC emissions per mass of filament 
384 
 
385 
The total number of UFPs emitted per gram of filament printed ranged from a minimum of 
386 
~2×108 #/g for the LulzBot-Laybrick combination to a maximum of over 2×1011 #/g for multiple 
387 
printers with ABS filaments. The ΣVOC mass emitted per gram of filament printed ranged from 
388 
a minimum of ~6 µg/g with the LulzBot-Polycarbonate combination to nearly 800 µg/g with the 
389 
LulzBot-Nylon combination. In general, ABS, PCTPE, and HIPS filaments had high mass-
390 
normalized emission rates of both UFPs and ΣVOCs, while PLA filaments had relatively low 
391 
mass-normalized UFP and ΣVOC emission rates. Interestingly, both T-Glase and polycarbonate 
392 
filaments (both used in the LulzBot printer) had low ΣVOC emissions but high UFP emissions. 
393 
Page 20 of 29
ACS Paragon Plus Environment
Environmental Science & Technology
  
20
Conversely, both laywood and laybrick filaments (also used in the LulzBot printer) had relatively 
394 
high ΣVOC emission rates but low UFP emission rates. These data suggest that filament material 
395 
selection drives both UFP and ΣVOC emissions, although knowledge of one type of emissions 
396 
may not necessarily be used to predict the other. 
397 
3.5. Implications for human exposure and health effects 
398 
Measurements of UFP and individual VOC emission rates presented here have important 
399 
implications for human exposure and health effects. For example, styrene, which is classified as 
400 
a possible human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC 
401 
Classification Group 2B),23 was emitted in large amounts by all of the ABS filaments and the 
402 
one HIPS filament. Caprolactam was also emitted in large amounts by four of the filaments: 
403 
nylon, PCTPE, laybrick, and laywood. Although caprolactam is classified as probably not 
404 
carcinogenic to humans,24 the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment 
405 
(OEHHA) maintains acute, 8-hour, and chronic reference exposure levels (RELs) of only 50 
406 
µg/m3, 7 µg/m3, and 2.2 µg/m3, respectively.25 We are not aware of any relevant information 
407 
regarding the inhalation toxicity of lactide, the primary individual VOC emitted from PLA 
408 
filaments. 
409 
To provide a basis for comparison to regulatory exposure limits and to help understand 
410 
potential implications for human health, we used these estimates of UFP and individual VOC 
411 
emission rates to predict steady-state concentrations that would likely result from constant printer 
412 
operation in a typical small well-mixed office environment. This effort is not meant to serve as a 
413 
detailed exposure model but rather as a screening analysis for potential health implications. We 
414 
should also note that this analysis does not take into account proximity effects that could serve to 
415 
Page 21 of 29
ACS Paragon Plus Environment
Environmental Science & Technology
  
21
substantially elevate exposures to both UFPs and VOCs in certain microenvironments compared 
416 
to well-mixed conditions. 
417 
Let us assume that one desktop 3D printer operates continuously in a well-mixed 45 m3 
418 
furnished and conditioned office space (i.e., the same office space reported in Stephens et al., 
419 
2013)7. Let us assume a worst case scenario in which a single printer has the maximum median 
420 
UFP and individual VOC emission rates from the findings herein, which include: ~1011 #/min for 
421 
UFPs, 183 µg/min for caprolactam, 113 µg/min for styrene, and 5 µg/min for lactide. Let us 
422 
assume a typical office ventilation rate of 1 hr-1,26 no sorption losses for the three VOCs (likely a 
423 
conservative estimate27,28), and a typical UFP deposition loss rate constant of 1.3 hr-1.29 Under 
424 
these conditions, steady state indoor concentrations of each of these constituents would be 
425 
elevated by ~58,000 #/cm3 for UFPs, ~244 µg/m3 for caprolactam, ~150 µg/m3 for styrene, and 
426 
~6 µg/m3 for lactide.  
427 
The predicted caprolactam concentration (244 µg/m3) would exceed all three RELs identified 
428 
by the California OEHHA,25 which suggests that although there is considerable uncertainty in 
429 
this estimate, exposure to caprolactam from desktop 3D printing in a typical office environment 
430 
with nylon and nylon-based filaments could lead to adverse health outcomes, particularly for 
431 
susceptible individuals. Acute exposure to high concentrations of caprolactam is known to be 
432 
“irritating to the eyes and the respiratory tract” and “may cause effects on the central nervous 
433 
system” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).30 
434 
The predicted styrene concentration in this configuration (150 µg/m3) would be 
435 
approximately 20 times higher than the highest styrene concentration measured in commercial 
436 
buildings in the U.S. EPA BASE study31 and more than 20 times higher than the average 
437 
concentration in U.S. residences.32 There are also reports that suggest exposure to styrene at 
438 
Page 22 of 29
ACS Paragon Plus Environment
Environmental Science & Technology
  
22
these concentrations could be problematic for human health. For example, high indoor styrene 
439 
concentrations have been estimated to yield relatively high lifetime cancer risks in previous 
440 
studies assuming typical potency factors,33 and even moderate styrene concentrations (i.e., 
441 
greater than only 2 µg/m3) have been associated with elevated risk of pulmonary infections in 
442 
infants.34  
443 
Although we are not aware of any regulatory limits for indoor UFP concentrations, an 
444 
increase in UFP concentrations of ~58,000 #/cm3 would be approximately 10 times higher than 
445 
what we typically observe in indoor air in our office and laboratory environments and what has 
446 
been reported as typical 8-hour average indoor concentrations in schools.35 However, it would 
447 
only be moderately higher than typical time-averaged concentrations in homes36 but lower than 
448 
what is often observed in other microenvironments.37  
449 
Given these findings, we are prompted to make the following recommendations. First, 
450 
additional measurements should be conducted to more accurately quantify personal exposures to 
451 
both UFPs and speciated VOCs that account for proximity effects presented by typical 3D printer 
452 
use patterns. Second, manufacturers should work towards designing low-emitting filament 
453 
materials and/or printing technologies. Third, in the absence of new low-emitting filaments, 
454 
manufacturers should work to evaluate the effectiveness of sealed enclosures on both UFP and 
455 
VOC emissions or to introduce combined gas and particle filtration systems. Until then, we 
456 
continue to suggest that caution should be used when operating many printer and filament 
457 
combinations in enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces or without the aid of gas and particle 
458 
filtration systems. This is particularly true for both styrene- and nylon-based filaments based on 
459 
data from the relatively large sample of printers and filament combinations evaluated here.
