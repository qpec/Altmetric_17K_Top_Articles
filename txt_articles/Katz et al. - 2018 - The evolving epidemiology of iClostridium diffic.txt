C
lostridium difficile infection is the most common infectious 
cause of health care–associated diarrhea among hospital-
admitted patients in developed countries and can lead to 
substantial morbidity and mortality.1,2 In 2002, an outbreak in 
Quebec, Canada, demonstrated the emergence of a virulent strain 
type known as the North American pulsed-field gel electrophoresis 
type 1 (NAP1; associated with ribotype 027).3 This strain type was 
associated with increases in the number of C. difficile outbreaks with 
higher rates of death and recurrence.4–8 However, the data suggest-
ing that the NAP1 strain is associated with more complicated disease

AbstrAct
BackgRound: The clinical and molecular 
epidemiology of health care–associated 
Clostridium difficile infection in nonepi-
demic settings across Canada has evolved 
since the first report of the virulent North 
American pulsed-field gel electrophoresis 
type 1 (NAP1) strain more than 15 years 
ago. The objective of this national, multi-
centre study was to describe the evolving 
epidemiology and molecular characteris-
tics of health care–associated C. difficile 
infection in Canada during a post-NAP1-
epidemic period, particularly patient out-
comes associated with the NAP1 strain.
MeThods: Adult inpatients with C. diffi-
cile infection were prospectively identi-
fied, using a standard definition, between 
2009 and 2015 through the Canadian 
Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Pro-
gram (CNISP), a network of 64 acute care 
hospitals. Patient demographic charac-
teristics, severity of infection and out-
comes were reviewed. Molecular testing 
was performed on isolates, and strain 
types were analyzed against outcomes 
and epidemiologic trends.
ResulTs: Over a 7-year period, 20 623 
adult patients admitted to hospital with 
health care–associated C. difficile infec-
tion were reported to CNISP, and microbio-
logical data were available for 2690 pa-
tients. From 2009 to 2015, the national 
rate of health care–associated C. difficile 
infection decreased from 5.9 to 4.3 per 
10 000 patient-days. NAP1 remained the 
dominant strain type, but infection with 
this strain has significantly decreased 
over time, followed by an increasing 
trend of infection with NAP4 and NAP11 
strains. The NAP1 strain was significantly 
associated with a higher rate of death at-
tributable to C. difficile infection com-
pared with non-NAP1 strains (odds ratio 
1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29–
2.82). Isolates were universally suscepti-
ble to metronidazole; one was nonsus-
ceptible to vancomycin. The proportion 
of NAP1 strains within individual centres 
predicted their rates of health care–
associated C. difficile infection; for every 
10% increase in the proportion of NAP1 
strains, the rate of health care–associated 
C. difficile infection increased by 3.3% 
(95% CI 1.7%–4.9%).
InTeRpReTaTIon: Rates of health care–
associated C. difficile infection have 
decreased across Canada. In nonepi-
demic settings, NAP4 has emerged as a 
common strain type, but NAP1, although 
decreasing, continues to be the predom-
inant circulating strain and remains sig-
nificantly associated with higher attrib-
utable mortality.

were primarily based on studies related to larger institutional and 
regional outbreaks.7,9–11 Since other strains have also been found to 
be associated with complicated outcomes,12,13 the association of 
NAP1 with severe disease or higher rates of health care–associated 
C. difficile infection in nonepidemic settings is less clear.
In Canada, national-level data on health care–associated 
C. difficile infection are collected through the Canadian Nosoco-
mial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP), a collaborative effort 
of the Public Health Agency of Canada and sentinel hospitals 
across the country that participate as members of the Canadian 
Hospital Epidemiology Committee, a subcommittee of the Associ-
ation of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada. The 
data collected provide a measure of the burden of illness, estab-
lish benchmarks for comparison and identify potential trends of 
disease. The objectives of this national, multicentre study were to 
describe the evolving epidemiology and molecular characteristics 
of health care–associated C. difficile infection in Canada during a 
postepidemic period, and to examine the effect of NAP1 strain 
type on patient outcomes and institutional rates of health care–
associated C. difficile infection over time.
Methods
data sources and population
Prospective surveillance for health care–associated C. difficile 
infection among hospital-admitted patients in Canada has been 
conducted by the CNISP since 2007. By 2015, the CNISP included a 
network of 64 acute care hospitals across the 10 provinces (Appen-
dix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.180013/-/DC1).14 Of these, 13 are large acute tertiary care hos-
pitals with more than 500 beds available within the facility, 
32 hospitals are of intermediate size (201 to 500 beds) and the 
remaining 19 hospitals are smaller facilities with fewer than 200 beds.
This study used data from adult-only and mixed (adult and 
pediatric combined) hospitals that participated in surveillance of 
health care–associated C. difficile infection from 2009 to 2015. 
Pediatric stand-alone hospitals were excluded.
The rate calculation of health care–associated C. difficile 
infection included only data on infection from adult-only and 
mixed hospitals that provided both the number of cases and 
patient-days. It was not possible to separate out the pediatric 
denominator data from these mixed hospitals. This resulted in 
the inclusion of 346 (2% of all cases) pediatric cases in the rate 
calculation of health care–associated C. difficile infection, but 
these were excluded from any further analysis.
case definitions
Case definitions for C. difficile infection have been previously 
described.15 In brief, surveillance for health care–associated 
C. difficile infection is based on a positive laboratory confirma-
tion of C. difficile infection and a compatible clinical syndrome 
developing 72 hours or longer after admission, or less than 
72 hours after admission if patients had been previously admit-
ted to the admitting hospital and discharged within the previous 
4 weeks. Severe outcomes were defined as admission to the 
intensive care unit, colectomy or death within 30 days associated 
with a positive test for C. difficile infection. All deaths were 
reviewed by a physician to determine whether the death was 
attributable to C. difficile infection.
data collection
The medical records for cases of health care–associated C. difficile 
infection were reviewed for clinical, demographic and outcome 
data, and a standardized form was completed. Clinical and demo-
graphic data were collected throughout the year, and severe out-
come information, C. difficile molecular typing and susceptibility 
testing of consecutive nonduplicate isolates were undertaken for 
cases occurring between Mar. 1 and Apr. 30 annually.
The data were collected by hospital staff (infection-control pro-
fessionals) and then submitted through a secure online platform that 
has built-in logic to prevent many common data-entry errors. Once 
data were submitted, the Public Health Agency of Canada’s epidemi-
ologist validated and cleaned the data, and followed up as needed.
laboratory methods
Between 2009 and 2015, stool samples from eligible patients admit-
ted to hospital were sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory 
(Winnipeg, Man.) for C. difficile isolation using ethanol shock treat-
ment. Toxigenic strains, as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, 
were further characterized using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis 
and antimicrobial susceptibility testing as previously described.5
statistical analysis
Rates of health care–associated C. difficile infection were calcu-
lated as the number of cases per 10 000 patient-days. For reporting 
purposes and to ensure confidentiality, we grouped the provinces 
into 3 regions: west (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan 
and Manitoba), central (Ontario and Quebec) and east (Nova Scotia, 
New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and 
Labrador). To assess significant trends over time for patient 
characteristics, laboratory and severe outcome results, we used 
the Cochran–Armitage test for categorical variables and the 
Mann–Kendall test for continuous variables.
To compare characteristics of the groups of patients with 
NAP1 versus all other strains (non-NAP1), we used the χ2 test for 
categorical variables and the Student t test or the Wilcoxon rank-
sum test for continuous variables.
Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the 
independent association between the strain types and outcomes 
(all-cause death or death attributable to C. difficile infection). Death 
attributable to C. difficile infection is defined as death directly and 
indirectly related to C. difficile infection. Covariates (i.e., sex, age, 
albumin level and leukocyte count) used in the regression models 
were specified a priori. Covariates were dichotomized as female 
versus male sex; age group 18–64 years versus 65 years or older; 
albumin level greater than 30 g/L versus 30 g/L or less; and leuko-
cyte count greater than 15 x109/L versus 15 x109/L or less.
To assess the relation between the proportion of NAP1 strains in 
individual hospitals and the reported institutional rate of health 
care–associated C. difficile infection, a generalized linear model was 
used with Poisson distribution and log-link function. The unit of 
analysis was the individual hospital. The model included year,

hospital size (beds) and region (west, central and east) as fixed 
effects and the natural log of patient days as an offset term. The 
model was estimated using generalized estimating equations with 
an autoregressive correlation structure to accommodate correla-
tions in the repeated-measures on the same hospital over time.
All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (release 9.3, 
SAS Institute) software with a significance level of 0.05.
ethics approval
The study was approved by the research ethics boards at partici-
pating sites as required by institution-specific policies.
Results
A total of 20 623 cases of health care–associated C. difficile infec-
tion was reported by adult-only and mixed participating hospi-
tals from 2009 to 2015. The number of participating hospitals 
ranged from 42 to 53 during the 7-year study period (Table 1), 
excluding pediatric stand-alone hospitals.
Most cases were detected in hospitals with more than 200 beds; 
53.2% of cases were from centres with 201–500 beds and 44.1% were 
from hospitals with more than 500 beds. Over the 7-year surveillance 
period, a downward trend was noted in national rates of health care–

associated C. difficile infection. The rate peaked (mostly driven by 
sites in the central region) at 6.7/10 000 patient-days in 2011 and 
reached a nadir of 4.3/10 000 patient-days in 2015 (Figure 1), repre-
senting a 35.8% relative decrease in the national rate. This same 
trend was noted in both western and central Canada. Rates of health 
care–associated C. difficile infection in eastern Canada (2.8/10 000 
patient-days) have remained lower than the national average 
(5.4/10 000 patient-days) across the surveillance period (p < 0.001).
Completed standardized data collection forms were received 
for 17 202 adults, and 2690 of these had molecular typing and ref-
erence susceptibility testing undertaken. Adult patients without 
data collection forms submitted (3075/20 623) and pediatric 
patients (346/20 623) were excluded (Table 1). 
Patient characteristics, laboratory findings and outcomes, by year 
and in aggregate, are shown in Table 1. Men and women were 
equally represented. Over the 7-year period, the mean age of adults 
with health care–associated C. difficile infection was 69.2 years; 
34.2% were between 18 and 64 years of age, and 65.8% were 65 years 
of age or older. There was a significant reduction in the age of 
patients with C. difficile infection over time, with younger adults rep-
resenting an increasing proportion of reported cases (p = 0.02). The 
time, in days, from admission to a positive result on C. difficile testing 
was shorter in later years (p = 0.002). There were no significant trends 
over time noted in temperature, leukocyte counts, albumin levels or 
severe outcomes (death, admission to the intensive care unit [ICU] 
or colectomy). There was a significant increase over the study period 
in the proportion of patients discharged or transferred by day 30, and 
a concomitant reduction of those remaining in hospital at that time 
point, whereas there were no significant changes over time in the 
rate of complications (death, ICU admission or colectomy).
Of the 2690 isolates that were available for molecular characteriza-
tion and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the top 3 most prevalent 
C. difficile NAP types were NAP1 (37.6%), NAP4 (14.2%) and NAP11 
(5.9%), accounting for 57.7% of all tested isolates nationally. A total of 
18.6% were classified as either NAP2, NAP3, NAP5–10 or NAP12, 
whereas the remaining 23.7% of the isolates could not be assigned to 
a currently defined NAP type. Regionally, NAP1 was the most preva-
lent strain overall in the central (47.5%) and western (30.1%) regions,

but NAP4 was the most common strain type in the eastern region 
(24.1%). Over the 7-year study period, there were significant changes 
in the molecular epidemiology of C. difficile both nationally and 
regionally, which included increases in NAP4, NAP6 and NAP11, as 
well as significant decreases in NAP2 and NAP1 (Table 2).
Overall, 44.5%, 28.4%, and 1.5% of the C. difficile isolates 
tested were resistant to moxifloxacin, clindamycin and rifampin, 
respectively. Resistance to moxifloxacin has decreased signifi-
cantly, from 63.3% in 2009 to 34.3% in 2015 (p < 0.001), and co-
incided with the decreasing prevalence of NAP1 isolates, which 
were predominantly moxifloxacin-resistant (956/1011 [94.6%]). 
There was no in vitro resistance observed to tigecycline and met-
ronidazole, but there was 1 NAP1 isolate identified with a min-
imum inhibitory concentration of 24 µg/mL to vancomycin. 
Among participating hospitals, NAP1 strains, as a proportion of all 
submitted isolates, varied year-to-year (range 0% to 100%). Patients 
infected with the NAP1 strain, compared with all other strains, were 
significantly older (74.0 v. 67.8 yr, p < 0.001), had higher median leu-
kocyte counts (13.0 v. 10.8 x109/L, p < 0.001), a higher overall death 
rate (15.6% v. 10.6%, p < 0.001) and a higher death rate attributable 
to C. difficile infection (6.6% v. 2.9%, p < 0.001). In general, both all-
cause mortality and mortality attributable to C. difficile infection 
increased with age in particular; mortality among patients infected 
with all strains increased from 6.1% in the group aged 18–64 years to 
19.7% in the group aged 85 years or older (test for trend p < 0.001). 
Mortality attributable to C. difficile infection among patients infected 
with all strains increased from 4.3% in the group aged 18–64 years to 
9.6% in the group aged 85 years or older (test for trend p < 0.001). 
Among patients aged 75–84 years, NAP1 strains resulted in higher 
overall death rates than non-NAP1 strains (19.3% v. 12.3%, p = 0.01) 
as well as mortality attributable to C. difficile infection (12.2% v. 1.4%, 
p < 0.001). Those aged 85 years and older showed no significant 
differences in all-cause death or death attributable to C. difficile 
infection in the comparison of NAP1 and non-NAP1 strains (Table 3).
Table 4 presents the results from the analyses to identify 
in 
dependent associations between the outcomes and each of the 
strain types and covariates. The results from simple bivariable tests 
of association of each factor are presented in the “unadjusted” col-
umn, and the results from the full multivariable logistic regression 
analysis adjusting for all covariates are presented in the “adjusted” 
column. In multivariable analysis, the NAP1 strain was significantly 
associated with death attributable to C. difficile infection (adjusted 
odds ratio 1.91, 95% CI 1.29–2.82). Age and leukocyte count (≥ 15 v. 
< 15 x109/L) also remained significantly associated with death 
attributable to C. difficile infection (age: adjusted odds ratio 2.45, 
95% CI 1.44–4.16; leukocyte count: adjusted odds ratio 2.96, 95% CI 
2.01–4.35). There was no significant association between NAP 
strain type (NAP1 v. non-NAP1) and all-cause death (Table 4).
An association was noted between the proportion of circulating 
NAP1 strains within individual centres and their associated rates of 
health care–associated C. difficile infection. We noted that for every 
10% increase in the proportion of NAP1 among all C. difficile strains 
submitted by individual centres, the rate of health care–associated 
C. difficile infection increased by 3.3% (95% CI 1.7%–4.9%).
Interpretation
Over a 7-year period, we observed a notable reduction in the national 
rate of health care–associated C. difficile infection and regional 
reductions in the rates in the central and western parts of the

country. We also note significant changes in the strains of C. difficile 
circulating in Canadian hospitals over time, as reported in other insti-
tutions and regions.12,16,17 Although NAP1 remained the predominant 
strain throughout the surveillance period, a substantial reduction in 
the prevalence of NAP1 was noted with concomitant increases in the 
proportions of other strains (predominantly NAP4), which coincides 
with reports from the United States18 and the United Kingdom.19 
These changes are notable as we also found strong associations 
between infection with NAP1 and attributable mortality, as well as 
associations between the proportion of NAP1 isolates circulating in 
individual hospitals and the local institutional rate of health care–
associated C. difficile infection. Whereas mortality increased with age 
and was generally higher in patients with NAP1 strains, the rate of 
deaths attributable to C. difficile infection was found to be similar for 
NAP1 and non-NAP1 strains in patients aged 85 years and older. This 
may be related to the frail nature of these patients and the morbidity 
of any infection, regardless of the causative strain.5 The decrease in 
national rates of health care–associated C. difficile infection may be 
attributable, in large part, to a variety of infection-control and 
quality-improvement initiatives instituted at facilities across the

country after major outbreaks 10–15 years ago (e.g., improved diag-
nostic techniques; antibiotic stewardship, particularly in regard to 
fluoroquinolone use; improved hand-hygiene practices; increased 
quality and frequency of environmental cleaning; increased use of 
sporicidal cleaning agents; and public reporting of institutional rates 
of health care–associated C. difficile infection), but our findings also 
support the concept that part of the improvement in institutional 
rates relates to the regression of predominance of the NAP1 strain.
The NAP1 strain, in particular, has been found to be associated 
with a risk of facility-wide and regional epidemics or outbreaks after 
its emergence.6,20–22 What is less clear is the impact of NAP1 on the 
severity of disease in nonepidemic settings,9–11 and whether (or to 
what extent) NAP1 leads to a higher baseline institutional rate of 
health care–associated C. difficile infection in nonepidemic settings. 
Despite the finding that recent NAP1 strains continue to produce a 
large amount of toxin, studies at single centres and at a provincial 
level have not demonstrated an association between the NAP1 strain 
and severe disease in a nonoutbreak setting.9–11 In our large Canad-
ian cohort of acute care hospitals during a nonepidemic period, we 
note a strong association between the NAP1 strain type (compared 
with all other strain types) and death attributable to C. difficile infec-
tion in patients 18–85 years. In concordance with a previous report,5 
there was no significant difference found for the rate of death attrib-
utable to C. difficile infection between NAP1 and non-NAP1 strains for 
patients aged 85 years and above, which were both high at 8.8% and 
9.3%, respectively (Table 4). Hospitals frequently benchmark their 
rates of health care–associated C. difficile infection to prior years at 
the same institution, or to other local or regional hospitals of a simi-
lar size or where the scope of services offered is similar. Our 
findings suggest that, as the proportion of NAP1 strain isolates 
increases in relation to all circulating strains, both the rate of health 
care–associated C. difficile infection and the number of severe cases 
can be expected to increase relative to a peer hospital with a lower 
proportion of NAP1 circulating isolates. We are not aware of pub-
lished work that quantifies the impact of a higher circulating 
proportion of NAP1 isolates on local hospital rates of health care–
associated C. difficile infection in nonepidemic settings.
limitations 
There are limitations to our study, inherent to large multicentre 
surveillance activities. First, although data collection was con-
ducted by experienced and trained infection-control professionals 
using standardized definitions that incorporate clinical symptoms, 
the data collection was unmonitored and there may be inconsis-
tencies between hospitals in identifying a case of C. difficile infec-
tion or applying the definition of “health care–associated event.” 
Because the diagnosis of a C. difficile infection is frequently based 
on laboratory findings, there may be some variability in the micro-
biological laboratory testing and identification of C. difficile at the 
different hospitals. Pediatric cases could not be differentiated 
from adult cases in the rate calculations among mixed hospitals; 
however, these comprised less than 2% of total cases of health 
care–associated C. difficile infection across the years and were 
excluded from further analyses.
In addition, although the hospital epidemiologist or another 
qualified physician determined the cause of death in patients 
with health care–associated C. difficile infection; attribution of 
death is often difficult and may be subjective. Finally, the group

conclusion
Rates of health care–associated C. difficile infection have fallen 
across Canada from 2009 to 2015. Although the NAP1 strain was 
associated with attributable death in nonepidemic settings, the 
reduction in the proportion of NAP1 isolates has likely contributed 
to the improvement in local and national institutional rates of 
health care–associated C. difficile infection. Infection prevention and 
control practices, antimicrobial stewardship and environmental 
cleaning should continue to be strengthened at the local level, 
as these areas positively affect institutional rates of health care–
associated C. difficile infection, regardless of circulating strain types.
