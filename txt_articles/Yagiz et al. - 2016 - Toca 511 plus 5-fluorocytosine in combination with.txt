Background. Toca 511, a gamma retroviral replicating vector encoding cytosine deaminase, used in combination with 5-fluorocytosine
(5-FC) kills tumor by local production of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), inducing local and systemic immunotherapeutic response resulting in
long-term survival after cessation of 5-FC. Toca 511 and Toca FC (oral extended-release 5-FC) are under investigation in patients
with recurrent high-grade glioma. Lomustine is a treatment option for patients with high-grade glioma.
Methods. We investigated the effects of lomustine combined with Toca 511 + 5-FC in syngeneic orthotopic glioma models. Safety and
survival were evaluated in immune-competent rat F98 and mouse Tu-2449 models comparing Toca 511 + 5-FC to lomustine + 5-FC or
the combination of Toca 511 + 5-FC + lomustine. After intracranial implantation of tumor, Toca 511 was delivered transcranially
followed by cycles of intraperitoneal 5-FC with or without lomustine at the first or fourth cycle.
Results. Coadministration of 5-FC with lomustine was well tolerated. In F98, combination Toca 511 + 5-FC and lomustine increased
median survival, but “cures” were not achieved. In Tu-2449, combination Toca 511 + 5-FC and lomustine increased median survival
and resulted in high numbers of cure. Rejection of tumor rechallenge occurred after treatment with Toca 511 + 5-FC or combined
with lomustine, but not with lomustine + 5-FC. Mixed lymphocyte–tumor cell reactions using splenocytes from cured animals showed
robust killing of target cells in an effector:target ratio–dependent manner with Toca 511 + 5-FC and Toca 511 + 5-FC + lomustine day 10.
Conclusion. The combination of Toca 511 + 5-FC and lomustine shows promising efficacy with no additive toxicity in murine glioma mod-
els. Immunotherapeutic responses resulting in long-term survival were preserved despite lomustine-related myelosuppression.

High-grade gliomas (HGGs), including glioblastoma, are the
most common forms of primary brain cancer and typically
recur following treatment with standard of care. Despite recent
advances in treatment, the prognosis for patients with HGG re-
mains poor, with comparatively short overall survival (OS) and a
profound impact on quality of life.1 The combination of Toca
511 (vocimagene amiretrorepvec),2 a retroviral replicating vec-
tor (RRV) carrying a prodrug activating gene, and Toca FC
(extended-release 5-FC) is being investigated for the treatment
of HGG. Toca 511 can successfully and safely deliver an opti-
mized yeast cytosine deaminase gene to tumors after either
intratumoral3,4 or intravenous administration in orthotopic gli-
oma models.5 Toca 511, in conjunction with subsequent Toca
FC, provides both direct killing of tumor cells by local production
of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and induction of a local and systemic
immunotherapeutic response resulting in long-term survival
after cessation of 5-FC treatment. The combination of Toca
511 and Toca FC is under investigation, with Toca 511
delivered intratumorally (NCT01156584), into the wall of the
resection cavity (NCT01470794, NCT02414165) or via intrave-
nous infusion followed by injection into the wall of the resection
cavity (NCT01985256) in patients with recurrent HGG.
Nitrosoureas (eg, lomustine, carmustine) are alkylating agents
that have shown modest benefit in some clinical trials for the
treatment of newly diagnosed6 and recurrent gliomas.7–9Lomus-
tine (1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea, CCNU) is used
alone or in combination with other antineoplastic agents, includ-
ing procarbazine, vincristine, and bevacizumab. Lomustine is usu-
ally given in combination as a single oral dose of 90–130 mg/m2
in cycles every 6 to 8 weeks but commonly produces dose-limiting

toxicity.8,10 A recent phase III randomized study comparing
lomustine with or without bevacizumab in patients with recurrent
glioblastoma did not show a survival advantage for the combina-
tion.11 Nitrosoureas alkylate DNA and RNA and may also inhibit
several key enzymatic processes by carbamoylation of amino
acids in proteins. Nitrosoureas such as lomustine exhibit some ac-
tion even against noncycling cells but specifically cause delays at
S and G2 of the cell cycle. They are known to synergize with agents
that are active in S phase such as 5-FU.12,13
5-FU is myelosuppressive when delivered systemically and has
an extremely narrow therapeutic window, precluding its use for
treatment of brain tumor.14 This is overcome by the use of Toca
511 and 5-FC to produce 5-FU locally within the tumor microen-
vironment, avoiding systemic immune suppression. Lomustine is
also myelosuppressive. Dose-related, delayed myelosuppression
is the most frequent and serious toxicity of lomustine, usually oc-
curring 4 to 6 weeks after drug administration.6 Therefore, it is im-
portant to confirm that any advantages of lomustine plus 5-FU
synergistic chemotoxicity are not outweighed by any detrimental
effects on Toca 511 and 5-FC induced antitumor immune re-
sponse. The ability to combine active chemotherapeutic drugs
with nontoxic or low toxicity anticancer agents may represent ad-
vancement in the treatment of HGG. We aimed to assess the ther-
apeutic potential of Toca 511 and 5-FC with lomustine and define
any potential additive toxicity in preclinical models of glioma.
We determined the effects of lomustine in combination with
Toca 511 and 5-FC treatment using 2 syngeneic orthotopic gli-
oma models. Survival was evaluated in immune-competent
murine models comparing Toca 511 and 5-FC treatment versus
lomustine and 5-FC without vector or the combination of Toca
511 and 5-FC plus lomustine. The rat F98 syngeneic glioma
model is commonly used for assessment of chemotherapeutic
agents but is only minimally immunogenic and is relatively re-
sistant to RRV infection and is therefore a good model to isolate
possible synergistic chemotoxicity to tumors.15,16 The Tu-2449
syngeneic glioma model has been used to show antitumor im-
mune activity generated by Toca 511 and 5-FC treatment.5 It is
an ideal model to test for the impact of potentially immuno-
suppressive drugs like lomustine on antitumor immunity. The
results presented here provided support for the investigation
of Toca 511 and Toca FC with lomustine in patients with HGG,
and a phase I study is now in progress (NCT01470794).
Materials and Methods
Drugs and Reagents
Lomustine was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. We contracted a
chemical supplier to synthesize 5-FC to order for in vivo assays.
Toca 511
Details of Toca 511 design, modification, and production have
been previously described.2,3
Cell Culture
The rat glioma cell line F98 (American Type Culture Collection)
and the mouse glioma cell line Tu-2449, which is a well-
established orthotopic glioma model in immunocompetent
mice,17,18 were cultured as described.3 –5
Animals and In-life Observations
Male Fischer rats (weight �200–250 g) were purchased from
Charles River Laboratories. Female B6C3F1 mice (age �8 wk)
were purchased from Harlan. Animals were acclimated for 7
days after arrival. Routine general health, in-life observations,
and body weights were collected throughout the course of
the study (Supplementary Tables S1–S3 and S5). All animal
protocols and experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.
Lomustine Treatment
Lomustine was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a con-
centration of 50 mg/mL and administered i.p. in the appropri-
ate volume to yield a dose of 30 mg/kg in mice19 (human
equivalent dose 90 mg/m2) and rats20 (human equivalent
dose 180 mg/m2). The appropriate volume of DMSO was ad-
ministered to controls.
Intracranial Surgeries
Animals underwent stereotactic placement of an indwelling
guide cannula with a 3.0 mm (B6C3F1 mice)3,4 or 5.5 mm
(Fischer rats) projection implanted into the right striatum, fitted
with a cap. The stereotaxic coordinates for mouse studies were
anterior-posterior ¼ 0.5 mm, medial-lateral ¼ 1.8 mm, and
dorsal-ventral ¼ 3.5 mm (from bregma). The stereotaxic coordi-
nates for rat studies were anterior-posterior ¼ 1.5 mm, medial-
lateral ¼ 3.5 mm, dorsal-ventral ¼ 5.5 mm (from bregma).
In vivo Survival Studies
The syngeneic cell line F98 was used as an orthotopic brain
tumor model in Fischer rats. The syngeneic cell line Tu-2449
was used as an orthotopic brain tumor model in B6C3F1 mice
as described3,4 (Supplementary material).
Tumor Challenge Assays
Tumor challenge was performed on all “cured” mice from
B6C3F1/Tu-2449 tumor long-term survival studies by subcuta-
neous implantation of 5×105 Tu-2449SC (subcutaneous growth
adapted subline) cells in 100 mL volume into each mouse on day
90 post implantation of intracranial (i.c.) cells. As a control,
Tu-2449SC cells were implanted into age-matched naı
¨ve
B6C3F1 mice. Tumor measurements were performed 3 times
a week.
PBS or 5-FC treatment were given to rats and survival was examined out to 80 days. (C) Summary of the survival analysis. (D) Blood samples were
collected 7, 12, and 69 (survivors) days after tumor cell inoculation. WBC, LYM, PLT, and NEU were determined. Dotted line represents LLN for

Results
Combination Treatment with Toca 511 + 5-FC and
Lomustine Prolonged Survival in the F98 Glioma Model
The effect of combining Toca 511 + 5-FC with lomustine was
tested in the F98 rat orthotopic glioma model. This model
has an infiltrative pattern of growth, necrosis, and other attri-
butes associated with human glioblastoma.22 This cell line
is
O6-DNA methylguanine-methyltransferase nonmethy-
lated6,15,23 and is relatively sensitive to lomustine (half-
maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50]¼ 20.8 mM; data not
shown).
F98 tumor-bearing Fischer rats were treated with either
lomustine or 5-FC alone or in combination at indicated time
points for a total of four 5-FC treatment cycles (Fig. 1A). Treat-
ment of rats with Toca 511 + 5-FC or lomustine day 10 + 5-FC
or in combination Toca 511 + 5-FC + lomustine day 10 resulted
in statistically prolonged survival compared with Toca 511 +
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) control (P ¼ .0009, P ¼ .0013,
P ¼ .0004, respectively). Moreover, Toca 511 + 5-FC alone sig-
nificantly prolonged survival compared with lomustine day
10 + 5-FC (P ¼ .018) (Fig. 1B). The relative order of median sur-
vival was Toca 511 + 5-FC + lomustine day 10 . Toca 511 +
5-FC . lomustine day 10 + 5-FC . Toca 511 + PBS (Fig. 1C).
Treatment with Toca 511 + 5-FC alone (Supplementary
Fig. S1A) or in combination with lomustine did not result in a
high level of “cured” animals after 5-FC treatment. Therefore,
the presence of cellular immunity against the parental tumor
cells in Toca 511 + 5-FC alone or in combination with
lomustine-treated animals was not determined.
Combination of Toca-511 + 5-FC with Lomustine Had
Promising Efficacy and Therapeutic Activity in the
Tu-2449 Glioma Model
The Tu-2449 mouse glioma cell line was used to examine the
compatibility of lomustine with Toca 511 + 5-FC. Previous stud-
ies have shown that this model displays several of the features
of human glioblastoma and is highly angiogenic.17,24 We have
shown that antitumor immunity is generated in this model
after treatment with Toca 511 + 5-FC4. This cell line is relatively
sensitive to lomustine (IC50¼ 18.6 mM; data not shown).
Tu-2449 tumor-bearing B6C3F1 mice were treated with ei-
ther lomustine or 5-FC alone or in combination at indicated
time points for a total of four 5-FC treatment cycles (Fig. 2A).
Treatment of mice with Toca 511 + 5-FC alone or in combina-
tion with lomustine at day 10 or lomustine at day 52 resulted in
statistically prolonged survival compared with Toca 511 + PBS
control (P ¼ .002, P , .0001, P ¼ .003, respectively) (Fig. 2B).
The median survivals in Toca 511 + 5-FC and Toca 511 +
5-FC + lomustine day 10 treatment groups were not deter-
mined, as more than 50% of the animals survived until day
90. The relative order of median survival was Toca 511 +
5-FC ¼ Toca 511 + 5-FC + lomustine day 10 . Toca 511 +
5-FC + lomustine day 52 . lomustine day 10 + 5-FC . Toca
511 + PBS (Fig. 2C). Treatment with Toca 511 + 5-FC (Supple-
mentary Fig. S1B) or lomustine alone or in combination resulted
in a high number of “cures” after cycles of 5-FC. Importantly,
lomustine in combination with Toca 511 + 5-FC did not

negatively impact the immunotherapeutic effect of Toca 511 +
5-FC leading to long-term survival after cessation of 5-FC.
Antitumor Immunological Memory Is Induced in
Long-Term Survivors after Toca 511 + 5-FC Alone or in
Combination with Lomustine Treatments in the Tu-2449
Glioma Model
We reported earlier that Toca 511 + 5-FC treatment induces an
immunological memory.4 However, lomustine can weaken the
immune response and have long-lasting effects after the treat-
ment.25 To further evaluate the effect of lomustine on the Toca
511 + 5-FC induced immune response, Tu-2449SC cells were
implanted into the right flanks of cured mice on day 90 after
the original i.c. tumor implantation. Tumors engrafted and
grew in all naı
¨ve animals challenged with Tu-2449SC cells
(Fig. 3A). Although subcutaneous tumors were observed initial-
ly during the first week, some of these tumors implanted in the
previously cured mice that were treated with either Toca 511 +
5-FC or Toca 511 + 5-FC + lomustine day 10 spontaneously dis-
appeared in 2 weeks without any recurrence (5/9 each treat-
ment vs 0/5 control), indicating the induction of an antitumor
immune response. In contrast, tumors in long-term survivors
from lomustine day 10 + 5-FC and Toca 511 + 5-FC + lomus-
tine day 52 treatments engrafted and did not shrink during
the experiment (0/5 and 0/7, respectively) (Fig. 3B-F). This sug-
gests that lomustine day 10 + 5-FC without Toca 511 did not
induce antitumor immune memory. The late addition of lomus-
tine in the Toca 511 + 5-FC + lomustine day 52 group may have
interfered with long-term immune memory, even though there
was initially sufficient antitumor effect on the intracranial mass
to prolong survival compared with the control.
To measure immunological reactivity or recognition of
tumor antigens, mixed lymphocyte–tumor cell reactions using
splenocytes from cured animals were monitored in real time
by xCELLigence electrical impedance analysis and showed ro-
bust killing of Tu-2449 target cells over time in an effector:target
ratio–dependent manner in Toca 511 + 5-FC and Toca 511 +
5-FC + lomustine day 10 treatment groups. There were im-
proved responses in the Toca 511 + 5-FC, Toca 511 + 5-FC +
lomustine day 10, and Toca 511 + 5-FC + lomustine day 52 treat-
ed animals compared with lomustine day 10 + 5-FC treated ani-
mals in an effector:target ratio–dependent manner (P , .05)
(Fig. 4). Importantly, the response was better in Toca 511 + 5-FC
and Toca 511 + 5-FC + lomustine day 10 treated animals
compared with the responses from Toca 511 + 5-FC + lomustine
day 52 treated animals in all the effector:target ratios tested
(P, .05).
Combination of Toca 511 + 5-FC with Lomustine
Had No Additive Hematological Toxicity in
Tumor-Bearing Rats
Toca 511 + 5-FC is designed to generate high levels of 5-FU lo-
cally in the tumor but is not expected to generate high levels
of systemic 5-FU. We have shown that Toca 511 + 5-FC pro-
duces higher 5-FU levels in the tumor compared with plasma
in tumor-bearing animals.3,26 Animals that received Toca
511 + 5-FC also did not exhibit signs of local toxicity (Supple-
mentary Fig. S1). Both systemic 5-FU and lomustine are
known to cause hematological toxicity, and therefore it is im-
portant to examine any potential drug interaction. Complete
blood counts and blood chemistry were evaluated in the
tumor-bearing rats at day 7 (before treatment) and day 12
(2 days post lomustine or 5-FC treatment) (Fig. 1D). The
blood counts were within the lower limit of normal (LLN)
during the study. Lymphocytes (LYM) and platelets (PLT) sig-
nificantly decreased in the lomustine day 10 + 5-FC and
Toca 511 + 5-FC + lomustine day 10 combination treatment
at day 12 compared with the values at day 7 (P , .01). The
decrease in white blood cells (WBC) was significant in the
Toca 511 + 5-FC + lomustine day 10 combination treatment
at day 12 compared with the values at day 7 (P , .05). Coad-
ministration of 5-FC with lomustine did not enhance hemato-
logical toxicity in tumor-bearing rats.
Combination of Toca 511 + 5-FC with Lomustine Had No
Additive Hepatotoxicity in Tumor-Bearing Rats
Lomustine is also associated with minor transient serum en-
zyme elevations and has been linked to rare cases of clinically
apparent acute hepatotoxicity. Mild and transient elevations in
serum aminotransferase or alkaline phosphatase or total bilir-
ubin levels are found in animals and human patients treated
with lomustine. In this study, serum levels of these enzymes
were also significantly higher in groups receiving lomustine
alone or in combination (P , .05) (Fig. 1E). Results indicate
that Toca 511 + 5-FC in combination with lomustine treatment
does not have any additive hepatotoxicity.

5-FC with Lomustine at 30 mg/kg Was Well Tolerated
in Non-Tumor-Bearing Rats
Naı
¨ve Fischer rats were treated with either lomustine or 5-FC
alone or in combination at indicated time points for a total of
6 treatment cycles of 5-FC (Fig. 5A). Complete blood counts
were collected at baseline and 4 days after initiating treat-
ment with lomustine or 5-FC. Lomustine or 5-FC alone or in
combination (lomustine + 5-FC) caused transient decreases
from baseline in WBC, LYM, PLT, and neutrophils (NEU) after
the first and fourth 5-FC cycles normalized to change in the
PBS group (all P , .05); however, all values were above the
LLN (Fig. 5B). Coadministration of 5-FC with lomustine was
well tolerated and did not enhance hematological toxicity in
naı
¨ve Fischer rats. Rats that were treated with lomustine or
in combination with 5-FC had abnormalities in lungs, kidneys,
and liver, consistent with known lomustine-related find-

511 + 5-FC + lomustine day 10 or Toca 511 + 5-FC + lomustine
day 52 caused significant decreases in WBC, LYM, PLT, and NEU
compared with Toca 511 + 5-FC alone (all P , .0001) (Fig. 2D).
However, values were within the LLN at the end of the fourth
cycles of 5-FC treatment. As in the F98 tumor-bearing Fischer
rats, administration of 5-FC with lomustine did not enhance he-
matological toxicity in the Tu-2449 tumor-bearing mice.

of six 5-FC treatment cycles (Fig. 6A). Complete blood counts
were collected at baseline and 4 days after initiating treatment
with lomustine or 5-FC. Lomustine alone or in combination with
5-FC at day 1 (lomustine day 1 + 5-FC) and day 43 (lomustine
day 43 + 5-FC) caused transient decreases from baseline in
WBC, LYM, PLT, and NEU after the first and fourth 5-FC cycles
normalized to change in the PBS group and were below the
LLN (all P , .01) (Fig. 6B). As in the naı

istration of 5-FC with lomustine did not enhance hematological
toxicity in naı
¨ve B6C3F1 mice. There were no safety-related
findings in animals treated with 5-FC alone (Supplementary
Table S5).
Discussion
This is the first report demonstrating that Toca 511 + 5-FC
treatment in combination with lomustine had improved che-
motoxicity against tumor in a difficult to treat model, with no
additive hematological toxicity, and did not adversely affect
immunotherapeutic activity at clinically relevant doses. The
safety and efficacy of Toca 511 + 5-FC in combination with
lomustine was explored in 2 rodent glioma models. In both
models, animals that received Toca 511 + 5-FC or in combina-
tion with lomustine had statistically prolonged survival com-
pared with PBS-treated control animals. Furthermore, in the
mouse Tu-2449 glioma model, where immunological memory
is induced with Toca 511 + 5-FC treatment, the combination
with early addition of lomustine did not adversely impact in-
duction of antitumor immune responses, despite lomustine-
mediated hematological changes.
F98 rat tumors are more aggressive and somewhat more
difficult to infect compared with Tu-2449 mouse glioma cells.
Therefore, the rat F98 glioma may be a good model with
which to study combination therapies as a surrogate for
those human HGGs that may be somewhat more resistant to
RRV spread. Combination treatment with Toca 511 + 5-FC and
lomustine increased median survival in this difficult to treat
model. However, high levels of cure were not achieved. One rea-
son for this lack of durable response may be the weak

immunogenicity of F98 cells. Earlier studies showed that trans-
fection with the gene encoding the B7.1 costimulatory mole-
cule,30 or syngeneic cellular vaccination combined with
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, did not
enhance F98 immunogenicity.31 In addition, the difference be-
tween the Tu-2449 and F98 glioma models in lomustine re-
sponse might be dependent on both the dose and the
schedule of treatment, which can influence the induction of
tumor regression and long-term immune memory. Additional
combinations or regimens may be required to break the im-
mune tolerance in this highly resistant model.
Previously, we also showed that immune components play a
role in eradicating intracranial tumor in the mouse Tu-2449 gli-
oma model after Toca 511 + 5-FC treatment4 (Hiraoka, unpub-
lished manuscript). In the current study using the mouse
Tu-2449 intracranial glioma model, long-term survival was
achieved in the majority of animals treated with Toca 511 +
5-FC alone or in combination with lomustine and in at least
some animals with the other treatments tested. Long-term
survivors were challenged with parental tumor cells to deter-
mine induction of antitumor immunity. Tumor rejection was
observed only in the Toca 511 + 5-FC alone or in combination
with lomustine, but not in the lomustine + 5-FC treatment
group. The strong antitumor activity, presumably directed
against innate tumor antigens, was observed more frequently
in Toca 511 + 5-FC alone and Toca 511 + 5-FC + lomustine day
10 treated mice compared with Toca 511 + 5-FC + lomustine
day 52 treated mice.
Assays by xCELLigence confirmed the presence of cellular
immunity against the parental tumor cells in Toca 511 + 5-FC
alone or in combination with lomustine-treated long-term sur-
vivors. Lymphocytes were collected from animals that had
cleared Toca 511-transduced Tu-2449 tumors through treat-
ment with 5-FC. Three ratios of effector cells (sensitized lym-
phocytes) to target (live Tu-2449 cells) were used to show
that those animals that clear Tu-2449 tumors through Toca
511 gene transfer and 5-FC therapy established a lasting
local and systemic immune response with cytotoxic activity
against the same tumor cells. Consistent with the negative im-
pact of late lomustine treatment on tumor rejection after
tumor challenge, Toca 511 + 5-FC and Toca 511 + 5-FC +
lomustine day 10 treated animals had the highest levels of cy-
totoxic activity at various effector:target ratios. Lomustine +
5-FC alone or Toca 511 + 5-FC + lomustine day 52 treated
animals did not show significant cytotoxic activity at low
effector:target ratios compared with Toca 511 + 5-FC or Toca
511 + 5-FC + lomustine day 10 treatment.
Hiraoka (unpublished manuscript) recently demonstrated
that in the Tu-2449 syngeneic glioma model, immune rejection
responses directed against endogenous tumor antigens are
mediated by CD4+ T cells in conjunction with CD8+ T cells
and likely enable full tumor eradication and durable responses.
The difference in response to rechallenge between Toca 511 +
5-FC + lomustine day 10 and Toca 511 + 5-FC + lomustine day
52 treatment might be related to the recovery time of LYM pop-
ulations after lomustine. Based on our data, even though LYM
significantly decreased 4 days after lomustine, they recovered
and were within the LLN values 4 weeks posttreatment. How-
ever, the recovered LYM population is now considered to be
immunologically naı
¨ve until such time as they are activated
against tumor antigen. Hiraoka also reported that Toca
511 + 5-FC treated Tu-2449 tumors decreased rapidly shortly
after 5-FC treatment started and never recurred even without
further 5-FC. Complete eradication of tumor cells was con-
firmed in long-term surviving animals. Therefore, tumor anti-
gen sufficient for priming of naı
¨ve T cells may not have been
available after late lomustine treatment. Alternatively, even
in the case of incomplete eradication of tumor, the 5-FC treat-
ment schedule may have affected antigen availability. Re-
peated cycles of 5-FC might be needed for the development
of immune responses against tumor antigens released by
Toca 511 + 5-FC induced cell killing.
Nitrosourea-based combination chemotherapy was stan-
dard treatment for recurrent HGGs before the introduction of
the alkylating agent temozolomide in 1999.9 In spite of its ap-
parent immunosuppressive effect, temozolomide does not in-
hibit antitumor immunity and therefore can be combined
with immunotherapeutic approaches to treat brain cancer.32
Differences between the effects on immunotherapies of alkyl-
ating agents may be related to variable sensitivity of different
WBC subsets, timing of nadir, or extent of cumulative effects on
the immune populations. This highlights the need to determine
empirically whether potential immune-suppressive treatments
can adversely affect immunotherapeutic approaches such as
Toca 511 and 5-FC. Our data suggest that Toca 511 + 5-FC
may help to overcome lomustine-related immunosuppression
in tumors with immunogenic capacity and potentiate the anti-
tumor effect of lomustine in some dosing regimens.
Lomustine-related myelosuppression usually occurs 4 to 6
weeks after drug administration and is dose related.27,33 The
WBC nadir occurs 3–4 weeks and the PLT nadir 4–5 weeks
after administration. Cell counts return to normal 6–7 weeks
after administration.34 As reported here, after Toca 511 + 5-FC
or lomustine + 5-FC or in combination treatment, the blood
counts were within the LLN in tumor-bearing rats. In the
mouse glioma model, groups treated with 5-FC + lomustine
alone or in combination with Toca 511 + 5-FC had transient
but significant lower WBC, LYM, PLT, and NEU counts compared
with the Toca 511 + PBS control or Toca 511 + 5-FC treatment.
Plasma concentrations of 5-FC at above 100 mg/mL for extended
periods of time (6 wk) or systemic 5-FU dosing is also known to
cause myelosuppression.35 However, Toca 511 + 5-FC produces
locally high levels of 5-FU and does not result in myelosuppres-
sion. As expected, the hematological changes in the Toca 511 +
5-FC or in combination with lomustine groups were not signifi-
cantly higher than the lomustine + 5-FC treatment group.
Lomustine and 5-FU are associated with off-target organ
toxicity mostly with cumulative or high doses.28,29,36 Therefore,
administration of both drugs simultaneously theoretically
could be associated with an unacceptable level of toxicity. In
our study, lomustine alone or in combination with 5-FC caused
serum enzyme elevations that were linked to hepatotoxicity in
the rat glioma model. Animals treated with 5-FC alone had no
treatment-related abnormalities. No additional histological
changes were observed in rats treated with lomustine in com-
bination with 5-FC, beyond those seen in lomustine alone, sug-
gesting that 5-FC and lomustine could be used in combination
with no additive detrimental effects.
In conclusion, the combination of Toca 511 + 5-FC and
lomustine shows promising efficacy with no additive toxicity

in murine models of glioma. Importantly, in immunogenic tu-
mors, the ability of Toca 511 + 5-FC to induce local and system-
ic immunotherapeutic responses resulting in long-term survival
was preserved despite lomustine-related myelosuppression.
These results support combining lomustine with Toca 511 at
early cycles of 5-FC for the treatment of patients with HGG. A
phase I study exploring the combination of Toca 511 and
Toca FC with lomustine is in progress (NCT01470794).
