Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Pancreatic fat accumulation may contribute to the development of beta cell dysfunction. Exercise training
improves whole-body insulin sensitivity, but its effects on pancreatic fat content and beta cell dysfunction are unclear. The
aim of this parallel-group randomised controlled trial was to evaluate the effects of exercise training on pancreatic fat and beta cell
function in healthy and prediabetic or type 2 diabetic participants and to test whether the responses were similar regardless of
baseline glucose tolerance.
Methods Using newspaper announcements, a total of 97 sedentary 40–55-year-old individuals were assessed for eligibility.
Prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance) and type 2 diabetes were defined by ADA criteria. Of
the screened candidates, 28 healthy men and 26 prediabetic or type 2 diabetic men and women met the inclusion criteria and were
randomised into 2-week-long sprint interval or moderate-intensity continuous training programmes in a 1:1 allocation ratio using
random permuted blocks. The primary outcome was pancreatic fat, which was measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. As
secondary outcomes, beta cell function was studied using variables derived from OGTT, and whole-body insulin sensitivity and
pancreatic fatty acid and glucose uptake were measured using positron emission tomography. The measurements were carried out
at the Turku PET Centre, Finland. The analyses were based on an intention-to-treat principle. Given the nature of the intervention,
blinding was not applicable.
Results At baseline, the group of prediabetic or type 2 diabetic men had a higher pancreatic fat content and impaired beta cell
function compared with the healthy men, while glucose and fatty acid uptake into the pancreas was similar. Exercise training
decreased pancreatic fat similarly in healthy (from 4.4% [3.0%, 6.1%] to 3.6% [2.4%, 5.2%] [mean, 95% CI]) and prediabetic or
type 2 diabetic men (from 8.7% [6.0%, 11.9%] to 6.7% [4.4%, 9.6%]; p = 0.036 for time effect) without any changes in pancreatic
substrate uptake (p ≥ 0.31 for time effect in both insulin-stimulated glucose and fasting state fatty acid uptake). In prediabetic or
type 2 diabetic men and women, both exercise modes similarly improved variables describing beta cell function.
Conclusions/interpretation Two weeks of exercise training improves beta cell function in prediabetic or type 2 diabetic individ-
uals and decreases pancreatic fat regardless of baseline glucose tolerance. This study shows that short-term training efficiently
reduces ectopic fat within the pancreas, and exercise training may therefore reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Introduction
Obesity and physical inactivity are major risk factors for type 2
diabetes mellitus. Obesity has been linked to the accumulation
of ectopic fat in different organs, such as the heart, muscle, liver
and pancreas [1]. Although ectopic fat in the liver and its asso-
ciation with metabolic disorders has been extensively studied
[2], less is known about the role of fatty pancreas despite its
clinical significance [3, 4]. A growing amount of evidence sug-
gests that fatty pancreas is more frequently observed in
individuals with impaired glucose tolerance [5–9]. Therefore,
approaches to maintain a normal pancreatic fat content could
reduce the risk of metabolic diseases and type 2 diabetes.
Insulin resistance and dysfunction of the pancreatic beta
cells characterise type 2 diabetes and are already present before
hyperglycaemia develops [10, 11]. A relationship between
pancreatic fat and impaired beta cell function has been shown
in some [6, 12] but not all [13–15] studies. A recent study
showed that pancreatic fat content decreased after bariatric
surgery, with normalisation of the first-phase insulin response,
only in individuals with type 2 diabetes despite similar weight
losses in type 2 diabetic participants and individuals with nor-
mal glucose tolerance, suggesting that fatty pancreas associates
with type 2 diabetes [9]. It currently remains unclear whether
pancreatic fat accumulation causes beta cell dysfunction and
consequently type 2 diabetes, or whether fatty pancreas and
type 2 diabetes are independent consequences of obesity [4].
Regular exercise training has a major role in the prevention
of type 2 diabetes [16]. It has recently been shown that both
moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) as well as

 different high-intensity interval training (HIIT) regimes can
improve beta cell function in insulin resistance [17–21].
However, the effects of exercise training on pancreatic fat
content are unknown, although it has been speculated that
lifestyle modifications targeted at decreasing pancreatic fat
could improve glycaemic control [22].
To study the effects of short-term exercise training on the
pancreas, we recruited healthy middle-aged men as well as
men and women with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. The aims
of the present study were to investigate (1) whether 2 weeks of
exercise training would have similar effects on pancreatic fat
content and beta cell function in healthy and prediabetic or
type 2 diabetic men, and (2) whether the effects of sprint
interval training (SIT) and MICT would differ in prediabetic
or type 2 diabetic men and women. We previously showed
that 2 weeks of either SITor MICT decreased intrathoracic fat
in both healthy and prediabetic or type 2 diabetic men [23].
We therefore hypothesised that pancreatic fat would decrease
by exercise training similarly in healthy and prediabetic or
type 2 diabetic participants.
Methods
Study design
This study was a parallel-group randomised controlled trial
conducted at Turku PET Centre (Turku, Finland) as a part of
a larger study entitled The Effects of Short-time High-intensi-
ty Interval Training on Tissue Glucose and Fat Metabolism in
Healthy Subjects and Patients With Type 2 Diabetes
(NCT01344928). We have previously published several re-
ports of the study focusing on different tissues [23–31]. The
first phase of the study investigated healthy men (with mea-
surements between March 2011 and February 2013), and the
second phase involved men and women with type 2 diabetes
or prediabetes (with measurements between February 2013
and October 2015). The study was conducted according to
the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was ap-
proved by the ethical committee of the Hospital District of
Southwest Finland, Turku (decision 95/180/2010 §228). The
participants’ health status was determined by a thorough phys-
ical examination during the screening. The purpose, nature
and potential risks of the study were explained verbally and
in writing before individuals gave their informed consent to
participate in the study.
Participants
The study was designed to investigate 40–55-year-old partic-
ipants as type 2 diabetes is often diagnosed within this age
range. Individuals with relatively newly diagnosed type 2 di-
abetes or with prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose and/or
impaired glucose tolerance, based on the criteria by ADA)
who could benefit from an exercise training intervention were
recruited via newspaper announcements. The inclusion
criteria for the healthy candidates were: male sex, age 40–
55 years, BMI 18.5–30 kg/m2, normal glycaemic control ver-
ified by OGTT, and no exercise on regular basis (V
⋅O2peak
≤ 40 ml kg−1 min−1). For prediabetic or type 2 diabetic candi-
dates, the inclusion criteria were the same, except: male or
female sex, BMI 18.5–35 kg/m2, and impaired glucose toler-
ance or type 2 diabetes according to ADA criteria [32]. A
candidate was excluded if he or she had a condition which
could potentially endanger their health during the study or
interfere with the interpretation of the results as explained in
detail previously [26, 31]. Of 97 screened individuals, 28
healthy men and 26 prediabetic or type 2 diabetic individuals
(16 men, ten women) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were
admitted into the study (Fig. 1). Of 26 prediabetic or type 2
diabetic individuals, the ADA criteria for type 2 diabetes [32]
were met in 17 (11 men); 13 (ten men) of these were being
treated with at least one type of oral hypoglycaemic agent
(median duration of type 2 diabetes 4 years), whereas four
individuals with type 2 diabetes (one man) had taken no pre-
vious medication for type 2 diabetes. The remaining nine pre-
diabetic or type 2 diabetic participants (five men) met the
ADA criteria for prediabetes, having impaired fasting glucose
and/or impaired glucose tolerance [32].
Randomisation to the SIT and MICT groups using a 1:1
allocation ratio was performed separately for the healthy and
prediabetic or type 2 diabetic participants with random per-
muted blocks, as previously described in detail [23, 27, 28].
Given the nature of the intervention, no blinding was used.
Two healthy and five prediabetic or type 2 diabetic partici-
pants discontinued the trial (see Fig. 1 for details).
Training interventions
Training interventions consisted of six exercise sessions over
2 weeks [25, 31]. SIT consisted of 4–6 episodes of all-out
cycling effort (Monark Ergomedic 894E; Monark, Vansbro,
Sweden) lasting 30 s each, with a supramaximal workload,
separated by 4 min of recovery. The MICT group cycled
(Tunturi E85; Tunturi Fitness, Almere, the Netherlands) for
40–60 min at an intensity equalling 60% of peak workload.
Training interventions are described in detail in electronic
supplementary material (ESM Methods).
Outcome measures
The number of completed experiments in terms of outcome
measures is summarised in Table 1. The reasons for not com-
pleting the experiments have previously been explained in
detail [27, 28].

 Pancreatic fat content The primary outcome measure of the
study was pancreatic fat content, which was determined by
proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) using a
Philips Gyroscan Intera 1.5 T CV Nova Dual Scanner (Philips
Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) with a SENSE body
coil (Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands). Details
of the protocol are described in ESM Methods.
Pancreatic metabolism As secondary outcomes, pancreatic
glucose and fatty acid uptake were studied by positron emis-
sion tomography (PET) after an overnight fast. Fatty acid
uptake was studied in the fasted state using 14(R,S)-[18
F]fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid ([18F]FTHA; 155 (SD 9)
MBq) as a tracer. On a different day, glucose uptake was
measured using 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG;
157 (SD 10) MBq) during a hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic
clamp when participants had reached a stable glucose concen-
tration of 5.0 (±0.5) mmol/l [23, 26]. Details of PET image
processing and analysis are described in ESM Methods.
Beta cell function variables, glycaemic control, and anthropo-
metrics Measurement of whole-body insulin-stimulated glu-
cose uptake (M value), details of OGTT, and determination of
body composition and peak exercise capacity (V
⋅O2peak ) are
described in ESM Methods. Insulin secretion rates (ISRs)
were calculated from C-peptide deconvolution for every
5 min for the whole 2 h period of the OGTT [33]. Early-
and late-phase ISR (ISRearly and ISRlate) were calculated as
the AUC of ISR from 0 to 30 min and from 30 to 120 min,
respectively. Total ISR (ISRtotal) denotes the AUC for the
whole 2 h period. An index of early ISR normalised to glucose
concentration (ΔISR0-30/ΔG0-30) was calculated as (ISR30-

 ISR0)/(glucose30-glucose0). Other beta cell function variables
were derived by modelling as described by Mari et al [34] and
described in detail in ESM Methods.
Statistical analysis
Sample size was calculated for the whole study (NCT01344928)
based on its primary outcome, skeletal muscle glucose uptake
[25, 29]. No sample size calculation was performed specifically
on the outcome measures of the present study.
The normal distribution of the variables was tested using
the Shapiro–Wilk test and evaluated visually. Logarithmic
(log10) or square root transformations were performed when
appropriate to achieve a normal distribution. Statistical analy-
ses were performed using hierarchical mixed linear models
with compound symmetry covariance structure. First, the dif-
ferences between healthy and prediabetic or type 2 diabetic
men were studied with the model, which included one within-
factor term (time; indicating the overall mean change between
baseline and measurement after the intervention), one
between-factor term (diabetes mellitus; healthy and prediabet-
ic or type 2 diabetic men) and one interaction term (time ×
diabetes mellitus; indicating whether mean change during the
study was different between healthy and prediabetic or type 2
diabetic men). Prediabetic and type 2 diabetic women were
completely excluded when comparing the effects of exercise in
healthy and prediabetic or type 2 diabetic participants to avoid
mixing the effects of sex and glucose intolerance. Second, dif-
ferences between SITand MICT in prediabetic or type 2 diabetic
participants, including both men and women (reported in ESM
Methods), were studied using a model that included within-
factor time, between-factor group (SIT and MICT) and interac-
tion terms (time × group; whether the mean change was different
in the SIT and MICT groups). The analyses were carried out
using the intention-to-treat principle and included all the
randomised participants. Missing data points were accounted
for by restricted maximum likelihood estimation within the lin-
ear mixed models. Correlations were calculated using
Pearson’s correlation (Spearman’s rank correlation for non-
normally distributed data). The statistical tests were per-
formed as two-sided and the level of statistical significance
was set at 0.05. The analyses were performed using SAS
System, version 9.4 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
USA).
Results
Healthy vs prediabetic or type 2 diabetic men
The effects of exercise training were first studied separately in
prediabetic and type 2 diabetic men (ESM Table 1). As most
of the variables changed similarly in these groups, prediabetic
and type 2 diabetic men were combined into one group.
Therefore, the effects of exercise training are compared be-
tween healthy and prediabetic or type 2 diabetic men.
Prediabetic or type 2 diabetic men were heavier, had more
fat and had a lower exercise capacity than healthy men at
baseline (Table 2). Exercise training improved V
⋅O2peak and
M value similarly in the healthy and prediabetic or type 2
diabetic men, and gave rise to a small but statistically signif-
icant decrease in waist circumference, fat percentage, subcu-
taneous and visceral fat, and HbA1c in both groups (Table 2).
Pancreatic fat content was lower in healthy men than
prediabetic or type 2 diabetic men at baseline (p = 0.032;
Fig. 2a,b). Two weeks of exercise training decreased pan-
creatic fat similarly in the healthy (from 4.4% [3.0%,
6.1%] to 3.6% [2.4%, 5.2%]) and prediabetic or type 2
diabetic men (from 8.7% [6.0%, 11.9%] to 6.7% [4.4%,
9.6%], p = 0.036 for time, p = 0.52 for the interaction time
× diabetes mellitus; Fig. 2b). Five healthy men had pan-
creatic fat content greater than 6.2%, which has been rec-
ommended as the cut-off value for normal pancreatic fat
[22], whereas three prediabetic or type 2 diabetic men had
pancreatic fat below 6.2% (Fig. 2a). When the men were
divided into groups with low (below 6.2%) and high
(above 6.2%) pancreatic fat content, exercise training de-
creased pancreatic fat by 31% only in those men who had
fatty pancreas at baseline (p = 0.001 for the interaction
time × pancreatic fat content; p < 0.001 for the time effect
in men with high pancreatic fat) (Fig. 2c). In the men’s
pooled baseline data, pancreatic fat correlated positively
with BMI, fat percentage, visceral fat and fasting glucose
concentration (Table 3).
Pancreatic fatty acid uptake and insulin-stimulated
glucose uptake determined by PET were similar in the
healthy and prediabetic or type 2 diabetic men at base-
line, and remained unchanged after 2 weeks of exercise
training (Table 4).
ISRbasal, ISRlate and ISRtotal were higher in prediabetic or type
2 diabetic men than healthy men at baseline, while ISRearly did
not differ between the groups (Table 4, Fig. 3a). Exercise train-
ing decreased ISRbasal in prediabetic or type 2 diabetic men (p =
0.034 for the time effect in prediabetic or type 2 diabetic men),
and increased ISRearly only in the healthy men (p = 0.006 for the
time effect in healthy men; Fig. 3a). However, the index of early
ISR normalised for glucose concentration (ΔISR0-30/ΔG0-30)
decreased similarly in both groups (p = 0.010 for time). Before
the intervention, ISRbasal and ISRtotal correlated positively with
pancreatic fat content in the whole study population, but no
correlations were found between changes in pancreatic fat and
beta cell function (Table 3).
At baseline, the potentiation factor ratio was lower in pre-
diabetic or type 2 diabetic men than healthy men (p = 0.010).
Two weeks of exercise training had a non-significantly differ-
ent effect on potentiation in healthy and prediabetic or type 2
Diabetologia (2018) 61:1817–1828
1821
 diabetic men (p = 0.086 for the interaction time × diabetes
mellitus; Fig. 3b).
Pancreatic glucose sensitivity was lower in prediabetic or
type 2 diabetic men than healthy men at baseline, and
remained unchanged by training (Table 4). Rate sensitivity
was not statistically significantly different at baseline, and it
decreased similarly after training in both healthy and predia-
betic or type 2 diabetic men (Table 4).
SIT vs MICT in prediabetic or type 2 diabetic men
and women
The effects of exercise training did not differ between men and
women (ESM Table 2), and therefore the effects of SIT and
MICTwere studied in the combined group of men and women
with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. As previously reported
[25], SIT and MICT decreased fat percentage, abdominal fat
and HbA1c to a similar extent, and increased M value, in pre-
diabetic or type 2 diabetic participants (ESM Table 3).
However, V
⋅O2peak improved only after SIT (ESM Table 3)
[25]. Both training modes decreased pancreatic fat content in
those individuals with fatty pancreas at baseline (p = 0.035 for
time, p = 0.47 for the interaction time × group). The decrease
in ISRbasal and ISRearly was not significant (p = 0.082 and p =
0.056 for time, respectively), and ΔISR0-30/ΔG0-30 decreased
(p = 0.005 for time; ESM Table 4), after training. ISRlate and
ISRtotal remained unchanged. The potentiation factor ratio in-
creased (p = 0.030 for time) and rate sensitivity decreased (p =
0.007 for time). Except for V
⋅O2peak, there was no difference
between SIT and MICT in prediabetic or type 2 diabetic par-
ticipants (ESM Tables 3 and 4). Baseline pancreatic fat con-
tent did not correlate with any of the whole-body or beta cell
function variables in prediabetic or type 2 diabetic men and
women (ESM Table 5).

 Discussion
The present study shows for the first time that exercise
training decreases pancreatic fat content regardless of
baseline glucose tolerance. Both SIT and MICT reduced
pancreatic fat, especially in individuals with fatty pan-
creas, underlining the beneficial effect of exercise train-
ing for those at risk of type 2 diabetes. Decreased pan-
creatic fat was not associated with changes in pancreatic
metabolism or beta cell function.

 At baseline, pancreatic fat content was higher in prediabetic
or type 2 diabetic men than healthy men, which is consistent
with previous studies [5–8], although a conflicting report also
exists [35]. Whereas pancreatic fat was positively associated
with BMI, body fat and visceral fat in all male participants,
these associations were lost when considering only those who
had prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, pancreatic fat
correlated positively with fasting glucose, ISRbasal and ISRtotal
in all men, but not in prediabetic or type 2 diabetic partici-
pants. Previous studies have reported conflicting results with
regards to the association between pancreatic fat and BMI,
some reporting a positive correlation [5, 7, 12, 35] and others
reporting no significant correlation [6, 22]. The association
between pancreatic fat and beta cell function is equally un-
clear. Studies addressing mainly non-diabetic individuals have
reported no association between these variables [13–15],
whereas other studies have shown that the association is dif-
ferent in normoglycaemic and prediabetic or type 2 diabetic
individuals [6, 12]. Beta cell functional variables have been
shown to have distinct patterns of decrease when spanning the
range from normoglycaemic obese individuals to those with
overt type 2 diabetes [36], and even beta cell defects in im-
paired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance are
different [37]. Therefore, it may be that different factors affect
pancreatic fat accumulation during normoglycaemia, impaired
glucose tolerance and full-blown type 2 diabetes [6, 9, 22].
These discrepancies highlight the fact that more research is
needed to better understand the causes and consequences of
fatty pancreas.
Just 2 weeks of exercise training decreased pancreatic fat
similarly in healthy and prediabetic or type 2 diabetic men. A
cross-sectional study investigating eight monozygotic young
adult male twin pairs with different fitness levels reported no
difference in pancreatic fat between more and less active twins
[38]. However, even the healthy participants in the present
study had relatively low physical fitness and high BMI, which
may explain why such a short training intervention decreased
pancreatic fat in the present study. Pancreatic fatty acid uptake
and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake as well as fasting serum
NEFA concentration were similar in healthy and prediabetic
or type 2 diabetic men at baseline and remained unchanged by
training. Hence, substrate uptake does not seem to explain the
baseline difference between the groups or the observed de-
crease in pancreatic fat after exercise training. However, we
measured fatty acid uptake in the fasting state, and it is possi-
ble that fat accumulation may occur during the postprandial

 period. A subgroup comparison between prediabetic and type
2 diabetic men (ESM Table 1) suggests that glucose uptake
may be different during the progression of type 2 diabetes.
Moreover, sex may also affect pancreatic metabolism (ESM
Table 2). However, the small number of participants in the
subgroup comparisons limits the interpretation of the findings.
Further studies spanning the range from obesity to overt type 2
diabetes could shed more light on the question of whether
there is a distinct pattern in pancreatic metabolism when type
2 diabetes progresses, and whether it is related to the accumu-
lation of pancreatic fat.
When dividing the men according to low (≤6.2%) and high
(>6.2%) baseline pancreatic fat content [22], exercise training
decreased pancreatic fat by 31% in those men who had fatty
pancreas to start with. The result that as little as 2 weeks of
exercise has a marked impact on those individuals with fatty
pancreas is clinically significant, as ectopic fat accumulation is
recognised as a major factor in the development of type 2
diabetes [3, 4, 22].
The effects of exercise training on beta cell function have
been previously studied in obese, prediabetic or type 2 diabet-
ic individuals using a disposition index as the measure of beta
cell function. Regardless of the different exercise modes
(HIIT, MICT or functional high intensity training [CrossFit])
used in different studies, all have reported an increased dispo-
sition index after the training intervention, and hence inferred
that training improves beta cell function [17–21]. However, as
the disposition index may be biased [39], we studied beta cell
function using several model-based variables. At baseline,
ISRtotal was higher in prediabetic or type 2 diabetic men than
healthy men. This reflects higher glucose levels and the recip-
rocal relationship between insulin sensitivity and insulin se-
cretion, implying that reduced insulin sensitivity is compen-
sated by increased ISR [40] until glucotoxicity becomes too
great for beta cells to compensate sufficiently [41]. After ex-
ercise training, ISRbasal decreased in prediabetic or type 2
diabetic men, while ISRearly increased only in healthy men.
When considering all prediabetic or type 2 diabetic partici-
pants (men and women), differences in these variables after
SIT and MICT were not significant (p = 0.082 and p = 0.056
for time, respectively). On the other hand, whole-body insulin
sensitivity increased similarly in both groups. The increase in
ISRearly in healthy men may be a response to improved glu-
cose sensitivity in the muscles, whereas prediabetic or type 2
diabetic individuals may compensate improved whole-body
insulin sensitivity by maintaining or decreasing insulin secre-
tion, which was already increased at baseline. A similar com-
pensatory decrease in insulin secretion in overweight adults
after training has previously been reported [21]. When nor-
malising early ISR for glucose concentration, it decreased
similarly in healthy and prediabetic or type 2 diabetic men.
A corresponding decrease was observed in rate sensitivity,
probably due to improved whole-body insulin sensitivity.
The potentiation of insulin secretion was impaired in pre-
diabetic or type 2 diabetic men compared with healthy men at
baseline. Our finding is in line with previous studies, which
have reported blunted and delayed potentiation in diabetic
individuals using a multiple meal test [42] as well as a de-
creased potentiation factor ratio in diabetic individuals com-
pared with non-diabetic control participants [6]. Exercise
training might normalise potentiation in prediabetic or type 2
diabetic men towards that of the healthy men (Fig. 3b; p =
0.083), suggesting that exercise training may improve the abil-
ity of beta cells to read potentiating signals, such as incretins
and neural signals. However, further work is necessary to
explore this.
Over the past few years, numerous studies have elucidated
the effects of HIIT, or its special case SIT, in both healthy and
type 2 diabetic participants, and have concluded that HIITis at
least as beneficial as the more traditional MICT in improving

 glycaemic control and maximal exercise capacity [43–45].
With regards to prediabetic or type 2 diabetic men and women
in the present study, SIT and MICT had a different effect only
on V
⋅O2peak, which increased only after SIT, as discussed in our
previous report [25]. The changes observed in all the other
variables investigated in the present study, including increased
whole-body insulin sensitivity, decreased pancreatic fat con-
tent, improved potentiation and decreased ΔISR0-30/ΔG0-30,
were similar for both training modes. To conclude, both SIT
and MICT can be used to improve the metabolic health of
prediabetic or type 2 diabetic individuals.
The present study is not, however, without limitations. The
number of participants was relatively small, although similar
sample sizes have previously been used in exercise training stud-
ies with a technically demanding study design. In addition, the
dropout rate was relatively high. The prediabetic or type 2 dia-
betic participants comprised a rather heterogeneous group con-
taining both men and women, some with prediabetes and others
with type 2 diabetes, but the number of each was too small to
fully address the differences between the subgroups. It has been
shown that pancreatic function differs during prediabetes and
overt type 2 diabetes [36]. However, in the prediabetic and type
2 diabetic men in the present study, pancreatic function and re-
sponses to exercise were quite similar, probably because the
individuals with type 2 diabetes had been relatively recently
diagnosed (median duration of type 2 diabetes 4 years). Also,
the oral hypoglycaemic medication taken by the participants with
type 2 diabetes was interrupted for 2 days before the pre- and
post-measurement PET scans. However, measuring glucose and
fatty acid uptake as well as pancreatic fat content were unsuc-
cessful in some participants (Table 1), and the heterogeneity of
the prediabetic or type 2 diabetic individuals may have affected
the results relating to pancreatic metabolism.
Using 1H MRS to measure pancreatic fat content cannot
distinguish intracellular fat accumulation in beta cells from
adipose tissue infiltration. Since pancreatic islets containing
beta cells cover only around 2% of the pancreatic mass, most
of the fat detected by MRS probably lies outside the islets.
While the main deposition of fat in the human pancreas re-
mains unclear, it has been suggested that 1H MRS measure-
ment of triacylglycerols in the whole pancreas represents a
surrogate marker for islet lipids [3]. In addition, individuals
with type 2 diabetes have been shown to have a lower pancre-
atic volume than healthy individuals [46], making voxel
placement more challenging. In the present study, the voxel
placement within the body of pancreas was carefully ensured
by axial, sagittal and coronal directions of investigation.
Finally, this study was designed to investigate the early-phase
responses to exercise training. Lim et al studied the effects of
dietary energy restriction in type 2 diabetes at different time
points over 8 weeks, showing that although liver fat content
decreased rapidly, the decrease in pancreatic fat content and im-
provement in beta cell function took longer to occur [47].
Therefore, the lack of association between changes in pancreatic
fat content and beta cell function in the present study may be due
to the short time course of the exercise intervention, and longer
exercise interventions will be needed to investigate the functional
effect of decreased pancreatic fat.
Conclusion
This study shows for the first time that exercise training
decreases pancreatic fat content regardless of baseline
glucose tolerance. In particular, individuals with fatty
pancreas benefited from exercise training, with a similar
decrease obtained with both SIT and MICT. As an ac-
cumulation of ectopic fat in the internal organs, includ-
ing the pancreas, is a key factor in obesity and the
development of type 2 diabetes, this study shows that
exercise training is an effective way to decrease ectopic
fat accumulation and hence reduce the risk of type 2
diabetes.
