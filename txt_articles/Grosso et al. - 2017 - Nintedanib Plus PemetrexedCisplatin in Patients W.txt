Purpose
LUME-Meso is a phase II/III randomized, double-blind trial designed to assess efficacy and safety of
nintedanib plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).
Phase II results are reported here.
Patients and Methods
Chemotherapy-na¨
ıve patients with unresectable, nonsarcomatoid MPM (Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status 0 to 1), stratified by histology (epithelioid or biphasic), were
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to up to six cycles of pemetrexed and cisplatin plus nintedanib
(200 mg twice daily) or placebo followed by nintedanib plus placebo monotherapy until progression.
The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).
Results
Eighty-seven patients were randomly assigned. The median number of pemetrexed and cisplatin
cycles was six; the median treatment duration for nintedanib was 7.8 months and 5.3 months for
placebo. Primary PFS favored nintedanib (hazard ratio [HR], 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.91; P = .017),
which was confirmed in updated PFS analyses (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.87; P = .010). A trend
toward improved overall survival also favored nintedanib (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.46 to 1.29; P = .319).
Benefit was evident in epithelioid histology, with a median overall survival gain of 5.4 months (HR,
0.70; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.21; P = .197; median [nintedanib v placebo], 20.6 months v 15.2 months) and
median PFS gain of 4.0 months (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.82; P = .006; median [nintedanib v
placebo], 9.7 v 5.7 months). Neutropenia was the most frequent grade $ 3 adverse event (AE;
nintedanib 43.2% v placebo 12.2%); rates of febrile neutropenia were low (4.5% in nintedanib
group v 0% in placebo group). AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 6.8% of those
receiving nintedanib versus 17.1% of those in the placebo group.
Conclusion
Addition of nintedanib to pemetrexed plus cisplatin resulted in PFS improvement. AEs were
manageable. The clinical benefit was evident in patients with epithelioid histology. The confirmatory
phase III part of the study is ongoing.

INTRODUCTION
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare
but aggressive cancer usually caused by asbestos
exposure.1 The incidence of MPM is expected to
have peaked, or to peak in the coming years in
countries that have carefully regulated the com-
mercial use of asbestos.2 However, asbestos re-
mains in use in many regions, which are likely to
see a corresponding increase in cases of MPM.3,4
MPM is typically diagnosed at an advanced
stage and overall prognosis is poor, with median
overall survival (OS) reported to be as short as
7 months.1 For patients with unresectable disease,
systemic first-line treatment with pemetrexed
and cisplatin is the standard of care,5,6 on the basis
of a phase III study that reported an increase
of 2.8 months in OS compared with cisplatin
alone (12.1 v 9.3 months).7 There are currently
no approved agents for second-line treatment,
although pemetrexed-based regimens (if not used

 as first-line therapy), vinorelbine, gemcitabine, or enrollment in
a clinical trial are recommended by some guidelines.5,6 Studies with the
multitargeted small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors cediranib,
dasatinib, sorafenib, and sunitinib have failed to show adequate clinical
activity as second-line treatments when used as monotherapy.8-11There
is a clear need for more effective treatments. Although several clinical
trialshave evaluated novel compounds in combinationwith pemetrexed
and cisplatin as first-line treatment, so far there have been few advances.
In an open-label, phase III study (Mesothelioma Avastin Cisplatin
Pemetrexed Study [MAPS]), the addition of bevacizumab to peme-
trexed and cisplatin (with maintenance bevacizumab) significantly
increased OS (median OS, 18.8 v 16.1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.77;
P = .017).5 Data from the MAPS study5 support the concept that
inhibition of signaling by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
pathway may be a potential treatment option for MPM.12
Nintedanib is an oral, twice-daily, angiokinase inhibitor targeting
VEGF receptors 1, 2, and3, platelet-derived growth factor receptors
a/b, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors 1, 2, and 3, as well as Src
and Abl kinase signaling.13,14 At the time this study was designed,
VEGF signaling was known to play an important role in mesothe-
lioma pathophysiology.15-18 Other signaling pathways inhibited by
nintedanib had also been proposed as valid therapeutic targets,
including the Src and Abl kinases, which are involved in MPM cell
migration,19,20 and FGF, which is overexpressed in MPM tumor
samples.21 Targeting more than one pathway may have the potential
for increased efficacy, and this provided the rationale for investigating
nintedanib in MPM. Unlike previously investigated small-molecule
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, nintedanib has a manageable safety profile
in combination with commonly used chemotherapy agents, making it
suitable to be investigated in combination with standard-of-care first-
line cisplatin plus pemetrexed.22-26
Here we report the results of the phase II part of LUME-Meso
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01907100), an ongoing phase II/
III study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of standard
chemotherapy combined with nintedanib or placebo in the first-
line treatment of patients with unresectable MPM (clinical trial
identifier: NCT01907100).

 standard treatment of pemetrexed and cisplatin, followed by continuing
nintedanib or placebo monotherapy as first-line treatment of patients with
unresectable nonsarcomatoid MPM. The phase II part of the study was
conducted at 18 sites in eight countries (Appendix Table A1, online only).
Eligible patients were $ 18 years of age, with histologically con-
firmed, unresectable epithelioid or biphasic MPM (Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1) and measurable disease
according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors modified for
mesothelioma (mRECIST).27 Key exclusion criteria were previous systemic
chemotherapy for MPM and sarcomatoid MPM (Appendix, online only).
Health authorities and independent ethics committees or insti-
tutional review boards at each country/center approved the protocol on
the basis of local regulations. The study was conducted in accordance with
good clinical practice and followed the guiding principles of the Decla-
ration of Helsinki, as well as local laws and regulations. All patients
provided written informed consent.
Randomization, Patient Allocation, and Procedures
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive nintedanib
or placebo. Randomization was stratified by histology (epithelioid or
biphasic).
Treatment with pemetrexed and cisplatin and either nintedanib or
matching placebo was given in 21-day courses. Pemetrexed and cisplatin
were administered for a maximum of six cycles at the following standard
dosages: 500 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) over 10 minutes on day 1 of each 21-
day cycle for pemetrexed, and 75 mg/m2 IV over 2 hours on day 1 of each
21-day cycle for cisplatin. Nintedanib was given orally at 200 mg twice daily
on days 2 through 21 of each 21-day cycle. Patients who did not experience
progression during the combination therapy phase continued to receive
nintedanib or placebo monotherapy until disease progression, undue
toxicity, and withdrawal of consent or death. Predefined dose reduction
was allowed to manage adverse events (AEs).
Tumor-response assessment by computed tomography was per-
formed at baseline (within 4 weeks before first treatment) and then every
6 weeks (6 1 week) and continued until progression or discontinuation
from study. Tumor response was evaluated using mRECIST27 according to
investigator assessment.
Safety was assessed regularly according to the protocol using US
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events, version 3.0. AEs of interest were categorized using standardized
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities–queries tailored to special
search categories.
End Points
The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by in-
vestigator assessment, defined as the time from random assignment to the
date of disease progression according to mRECIST,27 or death from any
cause. OS and objective response were secondary end points.
Statistical Analysis
For the phase II portion of the study, the sample size was calculated to
provide an initial assessment of the safety and efficacy of adding nintedanib
to pemetrexed and cisplatin, and was based on an assumed HR for PFS of
0.75 (median PFS, 8 months for the nintedanib plus pemetrexed and cisplatin
combination v 6 months for the placebo-pemetrexed-cisplatin regi-
men). Originally, the primary analysis of PFS was planned after 65 PFS
events (approximately 75% of all randomly assigned patients). The target
sample size was, therefore, 86 patients. This was considered sufficient to have
a high probability of detecting a true signal of treatment benefit.
Following the data monitoring committee recommendation to
modify the trial into a confirmatory phase III study, and after consultation
with regulatory authorities, the phase II part of the trial was unblinded for
the primary PFS analysis to refine assumptions for sample size calculation
in phase III (data cutoff, March 4, 2016). The number of phase II PFS
events (ie, progression and deaths) reached at that time was 69. The
primary OS analysis and corresponding updated PFS analysis was to be
performed after approximately 61 deaths.
Efficacy analyses included all randomly assigned patients, using the
intention-to-treat principle. PFS and OS were analyzed using Kaplan-
Meier methods. P values were calculated from the two-sided stratified log-
rank test. The objective response rate was compared between treatment groups
using a logistic regression model. All statistical analyses were performed using
SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and are intended to be descriptive.
The phase III part started recruitment in May 2016, remains blinded,
and will be used for the confirmatory analysis of this trial. The patients
included in phase II will not be counted toward phase III recruitment.
RESULTS
Patients
Between September 2013 and December 2014, 104 patients
were screened and 87 patients were randomly assigned to treat-
ment with pemetrexed and cisplatin and either nintedanib (n = 44)
or matching placebo (n = 43). Two patients in the placebo arm

 never received any study treatment because of contraindications.
Details of patient disposition are shown in Figure 1.
Clinical characteristics and demographics in each arm
showed similar baseline parameters (Table 1). Overall, the
median age of patients was 67 years, 79% of patients were male,
89% had epithelioid histology, and 70% had known previous
exposure to asbestos. Five (11.4%) patients in the nintedanib
group and two (4.7%) patients in the placebo group had
previous surgery.
Median duration of nintedanib/placebo treatment was
7.8 months (range, 0.1 to 33.2 months) in the nintedanib group
and 5.3 months (range, 0.4 to 28.9 months) in the placebo group at
the time of the primary OS analysis. Median follow-up was
29.0 months (95% CI, 26.9 to 33.1 months).
The median number of pemetrexed and cisplatin courses was
six in both treatment groups. In the nintedanib arm, 26 patients
(59.1%) received six cycles of pemetrexed and 23 patients (52.3%)
received six cycles of cisplatin. In the placebo arm, 22 patients
(53.7%) received six cycles of pemetrexed and 21 patients (51.2%)
received six cycles of cisplatin. Pemetrexed dose reductions were
observed in 11 patients (25.0%) treated with nintedanib and two
(4.9%) in the placebo arm, whereas cisplatin dose reductions were
observed in nine patients (20.5%) treated with nintedanib and five
(12.2%) in the placebo arm.
Nintedanib dose reductions were required in 17 patients
(38.6%), of whom five patients (11.4%) required a second dose
reduction. Placebo dose reduction was required in seven patients
(17.1%). Mean dose intensities for chemotherapy and for ninte-
danib and placebo are listed in Table 2.
Efficacy
The main efficacy results for the overall population as well as
the population analyzed by histology are listed in Table 3. Nin-
tedanib treatment improved PFS compared with placebo. This
finding was observed at the primary PFS analysis with 69 PFS
events (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.91; P = .017) and confirmed at
the updated analysis (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.87; P = .010) with
72 PFS events.
When analyzed by histology, improvement in PFS was evident
in patients with epithelioid histology (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.30 to
0.82; P = .006). The number of patients with biphasic histology
MPM (n = 10) was too low to provide a reliable estimate of the
treatment effect. Kaplan-Meier curves of PFS for the overall pa-
tient population and the epithelioid population at the time of the
primary OS analysis are shown in Figures 2A and 2B; treat-
ment with nintedanib improved median PFS by 3.7 months for
the overall population and by 4.0 months for the epithelioid
population.
At the time of the primary OS analysis, 62 OS events (71%)
had occurred. Analysis of OS showed an improvement favoring
nintedanib treatment in all patients (median OS, 18.3 months in
nintedanib group v 14.2 months in placebo group; HR, 0.77; 95%
CI, 0.46 to 1.29; P = .319; Table 3 and Fig 2C). For patients with
epithelioid histology the median OS was 20.6 months with nin-
tedanib v 15.2 months with placebo (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.40 to
1.21; P = .197; Table 3 and Fig 2D).
The effect of nintedanib on PFS and OS was consistent across
the subgroups, with the exception of patients with biphasic his-
tology (Fig 3).More than half of patients in each treatment group

 (nintedanib 64% v placebo 70%) received subsequent therapy
(Appendix Table A2, online only).
The best overall tumor response according to mRECIST
criteria showed more objective responses (all partial responses)
in the nintedanib arm (n = 25; 56.8%) than in the placebo arm
(n = 19; 44.2%; odds ratio, 1.66; 95% CI, 0.72 to 3.9).
Safety and Adverse Events
All patients experienced at least one AE of any grade and
nearly all patients in the nintedanib (97.7%) and placebo (97.6%)
groups experienced an investigator-defined drug-related AE. The
most frequently reported AEs ($ 60% of patients, any CTCAE
grade) in the nintedanib arm and more frequent with nintedanib
than placebo were diarrhea and neutropenia. Table 4 lists the most
common AEs by group terms. Grade $ 3 AEs were reported in 35
patients (79.5%) in the nintedanib arm and 22 patients (53.7%) in
the placebo arm. There was an increased frequency of grade $ 3
group-term AEs of neutropenia in the nintedanib arm (43.2% v
12.2%), although the rate of febrile neutropenia (group term) was
low (4.5%; n = 2) in the nintedanib arm and not reported with
placebo. There were no reports of sepsis with nintedanib.
Incidence of AEs (group terms) commonly associated with
anti-angiogenic agents were either balanced between treatment
arms or reported in lower numbers of patients in the nintedanib arm.
The events of interest (nintedanib v placebo) included bleeding
(11.4% v 12.2%), GI perforation (0% v 2.4%), thromboembolism
(9.1% v 17.1%), and venous thromboembolism (6.8% v 14.6%).
There were no reports of arterial thromboembolism.
Serious AEs (SAEs) occurred in 18 patients (40.9%) in the
nintedanib arm and in 17 patients (41.5%) in the placebo arm. The
most frequent SAEs (all grades; nintedanib v placebo) were neu-
tropenia (9.1% [n = 4] v 2.4% [n = 1]), diarrhea (6.8% [n = 3] v 0),
pyrexia (6.8% [n = 3] v 4.9% [n = 2]), and pulmonary embolism
(2.3% [n = 1] v 9.8% [n = 4], respectively). Three patients in the
placebo arm died as a result of SAEs: one patient from disease
progression, one patient from general physical health deterioration,
and one patient from both disease progression and treatment-related
nephrotic syndrome. One fatal SAE was reported in the nintedanib
group (disease progression unrelated to treatment).

 Three patients (6.8%) in the nintedanib arm and seven pa-
tients (17.1%) in the placebo arm experienced AEs leading to
permanent discontinuation of last study medication. AEs leading
to discontinuation in the nintedanib arm included upper ab-
dominal pain and vomiting in one patient; increased aspartate
aminotransferase/blood alkaline phosphatase levels in one patient;
and neutropenia, aplasia, and Klebsiella pneumonia in one patient;
no patients discontinued treatment because of diarrhea. Fourteen
patients (31.8%) in the nintedanib arm and six (14.6%) in the
placebo arm experienced AEs leading to dose reduction of nin-
tedanib or placebo. AEs leading to dose reduction of nintedanib
occurring in more than one patient included diarrhea (9.1%),
increased alanine aminotransferase levels (9.1%), nausea (4.5%),
and neutropenia (4.5%).
DISCUSSION
The addition of nintedanib to standard pemetrexed and cisplatin
therapy demonstrated improved clinical efficacy in the first-line
treatment of patients with MPM, as evidenced by improved PFS
with a corresponding improvement in OS and a manageable safety
profile. A benefit was observed in patients with epithelioid his-
tology; the median PFS prolongation of 4 months in these pa-
tients (with minimal additional toxicity) provided the rationale to
proceed to the phase III component of the study. The median OS
time of 20.6 months achieved in the epithelioid histology subtype
is, to our knowledge, the longest reported in a randomized, double-
blind phase II study.
The positive findings of the MAPS study with the addition of
bevacizumab to standard pemetrexed plus cisplatin provide con-
text to our data. The HR for PFS was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.75;
median 9.2 months with bevacizumab v 7.3 months with placebo)
in the MAPS study, whereas the HR for OS was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.62
to 0.95; median 18.2 months with bevacizumab v 16.1 months with
placebo). In our trial, with all the limitations related to differences
between the studies, the HRs for PFS and OS confirm the value
of targeting angiogenesis as a treatment approach in MPM. In-
terestingly, in the MAPS trial, the effect of bevacizumab on survival
was more pronounced in patients with sarcomatoid or mixed
histology (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.02) than in patients with
epithelioid histology (OS HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.06).
However, between-trial comparisons should be done with caution
because of the differences in size (phase II for LUME-Meso v phase

 III for MAPS), design (double blind v open label), and patient
eligibility (nonsarcomatoid MPM v all histologic subtypes; age of
patients $ 18 years v 18 to 75 years).
Although inhibition of angiogenesis via VEGF by bevacizumab
has been demonstrated as a viable approach, nintedanib combines
VEGF receptor inhibition with targeting other pathways: namely, the
platelet-derived growth factor pathway, associated with poor prog-
nosis in MPM,28 and the FGF receptor pathway, implicated in the
pathogenesis of MPM in preclinical studies.12 In addition to the
inhibition of proangiogenic signaling, preclinical data show that
nintedanib strongly reduces the colony-forming capacity and mi-
gratory activity of MPM cell lines—this appears to be a direct effect on
the mesothelioma cells themselves29,30—and inhibits MPM tumor
growth in human xenograft models.29 It is possible that Src inhibition
by nintedanib14 may add to the clinical activity in patients with MPM.
The broad inhibition profile of nintedanib, coupled with the direct
antitumor activity, may account for the promising results observed.
The overall safety profile of nintedanib in combination with
chemotherapy was as expected from previous studies. AEs were
manageable. Although the incidence of diarrhea reported here was
higher than reported with nintedanib when given with docetaxel in
a study of lung cancer,24 rates are similar to those previously re-
ported when nintedanib was given with a doublet chemotherapy,
such as with paclitaxel plus carboplatin or modified infusional
fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX6).23,31 Although
diarrhea was common, it was mainly of low grade, reversible with
dose interruption, and no patients permanently discontinued study
medication because of this event. Clinical experience with ninte-
danib in non-small cell lung cancer indicates that diarrhea can be
managed with appropriate medication or existing dose reduction
protocols.32 Certain grade $ 3 AEs were reported more frequently in
the nintedanib arm than in the placebo arm, including increased
liver enzyme levels and neutropenia, although complications of the
latter, such as febrile neutropenia, were low; sepsis was also not
reported. Liver enzyme elevations have been reported previously
with nintedanib in combination with docetaxel and are generally
reversible and manageable.24 Incidences of AEs typically associated
with VEGF/VEGF-receptor inhibitors were either balanced between
the groups, as in the case of hypertension, or reported in fewer
patients in the nintedanib arm.
The dose intensity of the pemetrexed plus cisplatin regimen
was maintained in the presence of nintedanib. The median number
of pemetrexed plus cisplatin courses was six in both groups.
Approximately twice as many patients in the nintedanib group,
compared with the placebo group, experienced an AE leading to
dose reduction of nintedanib or placebo; however, the rate of AEs
leading to discontinuation was higher in the placebo group. The
proportion of patients who received poststudy treatment was also
similar between groups (nintedanib, 64% v placebo, 70%), in-
dicating that addition of nintedanib to standard doublet chemo-
therapy did not adversely influence patients’ ability to receive
subsequent treatments.
The strengths of this phase II study include a randomized
double-blind design, removing potential sources of bias. Although

 recent research has suggested that PFS may not be a valid surrogate
end point for OS in MPM,33 analyses were conducted on small, phase
II studies, most of which included only one treatment arm and did not
include pemetrexed. These factors may have had an effect on the lack
of observed correlation between PFS and OS. The trend toward
improved OS in our study is reassuring and adds to the evidence from
other larger trials that have shown an association.5,7 Several limitations
should be considered. These include the relatively small sample size
requiring confirmation of results, and the small number of patients
with biphasic histology, which limited the interpretation of results in
this subgroup. Lack of central pathologic review and independent
review of disease progression is also a limitation in a trial setting.
Finally, no predictive biomarker that could improve patient selection
for nintedanib treatment has been identified in patients with MPM.
However, blood samples have been collected in phase II and will be
collected during phase III to investigate potential biomarkers.
In conclusion, the addition of nintedanib to standard che-
motherapy demonstrated a clinically meaningful benefit in the
first-line treatment of patients with MPM. The benefit was evident
in patients with epithelioid histology. These findings warrant
confirmation and the global, prospectively randomized, phase III
trial is recruiting patients with epithelioid MPM to confirm the
activity of nintedanib in this patient population.

Appendix
Phase II inclusion criteria
• Male or female patients age $ 18 years
• Histologically confirmed malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM; subtype: epithelioid or biphasic)
• Life expectancy of at least 3 months in the opinion of the investigator
• Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1
• Measurable disease according to modified RECIST criteria
Key phase II exclusion criteria
• Previous systemic chemotherapy for MPM
• Prior treatment with nintedanib or any other vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor
• Patients with sarcomatoid subtype MPM
• Patients with symptomatic neuropathy
• Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance, 45 to 79 mL/min) taking nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with short half-lives unable or unwilling to interrupt NSAIDs for 5 days (2 days before, day of,
and 2 days after treatment with pemetrexed)
• Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance, 45 to 79 mL/min) taking NSAIDs with long half-
lives unable or unwilling to interrupt NSAIDs for 8 days (5 days before, day of, and 2 days after treatment with pemetrexed)
• Known hypersensitivity or any contraindications to the trial drugs, including pemetrexed or cisplatin, to their excipients or
to contrast media
• Radiotherapy (except extremities) within 3 months before baseline imaging (localized radiotherapy treatment for
symptomatic relief is allowed if it occurred at least 2 weeks before random assignment and the measurable disease is outside
of the field of radiotherapy)
• In opinion of the investigator, persistence of clinically relevant therapy related toxicity from previous radiotherapy
• Patients who may be eligible for or being considered for radical resection or elective surgery during the course of the study.
Note: Prior surgery is allowed if it occurred at least 4 weeks before random assignment, there is complete healing, and there is
residual measurable disease
• Radical surgery within 4 weeks before random assignment
• Active brain metastases (eg, stable for , 4 weeks, no adequate previous treatment with radiotherapy, symptomatic, requiring
treatment with anticonvulsants; dexamethasone therapy will be allowed if administered as stable dose for at least 1 month
before random assignment)
• Leptomeningeal disease
• Radiographic evidence (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) of cavitary or necrotic tumors or local
invasion of major blood vessels by MPM
