BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have compared coronary artery bypass 
graft (CABG) with percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) for coronary 
revascularization. There is considerable evidence that adherence to 
medical therapy can affect the outcomes of therapeutic interventions. 
However, the long-term influence of compliance with recommended medical 
therapy on the comparative outcomes of CABG versus PCI remains to be 
defined.
METHODS: All non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction patients 
undergoing coronary revascularization in an 8-hospital network were 
followed for up to 8 years to determine medication history and major 
adverse cardiac events: all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, 
and reintervention. All mortalities were checked against the Social Security 
Death Index. Survival curves were derived with Kaplan-Meier methods; 
hazard ratios were calculated with the Cox proportional hazard model; and 
propensity score matching was used to account for differences in patient 
selection.
RESULTS: Among the 973 CABG and 2255 PCI patients, Kaplan-Meier 
major adverse cardiac event–free survival curves demonstrated a 
significant benefit for antiplatelet, lipid-lowering, and β-blocker therapy 
in both the CABG and PCI groups (P=0.001 for all 3 medications). Cox 
regression identified compliance with optimal medical therapy as a more 
powerful predictor of major adverse cardiac event–free survival than 
choice of therapy (hazard ratio for noncompliance=2.79; 95% confidence 
limits, 2.19–3.54; P<0.001; hazard ratio for PCI versus CABG=1.68, 95% 
confidence limits, 138–2.04; P<0.001). In propensity-matched patients, 
CABG outcomes were superior to PCI outcomes in patients nonadherent 
to optimal medical therapy (P=0.001) but were not different in patients 
adherent to optimal medical therapy (P=0.574).
CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of coronary revascularization strategy, 
medication adherence has a dramatic effect on long-term outcome. Among 
comparable patients who adhere to optimal medical therapy, outcomes of 
PCI and CABG may not differ; however, among nonadherent patients, CABG 
affords better major adverse cardiac event–free survival. Therefore, patient 
compliance with medical therapy may inform clinical decision making and 
should be incorporated into all future comparative studies of comparative 
coronary revascularization strategies.

i
t is well recognized that medication adherence can 
vary widely among patient populations and medical 
conditions1 and that such variance can have a ma-
jor effect on clinical outcome.2,3 Specifically, appro-
priate medical therapy is known to affect long-term 
outcomes of patients undergoing coronary artery 
revascularization (CR), whether surgically or inter-
ventionally.4,5 Similarly, there are probably very few 
therapeutic choices that have been as well studied 
as that between coronary artery bypass graft surgery 
(CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 
for the treatment of coronary artery disease.6,7 What 
has been remarkably absent from prior analyses, how-
ever, has been the effect of adherence to evidence-
based medical therapy on the relative outcome of 
CABG versus PCI in patients with advanced coronary 
artery disease. Because patient selection and behav-
ior in randomized, clinical trials may not reflect actual 
clinical practice,8 we investigated the effect of adher-
ence to guideline-driven medical therapy on the out-
comes of CABG versus PCI in a prospective, multicenter, 
community-based registry.
MethOds
As published previously,9,10 the CARE registry (Coronary 
Artery Revascularization Evaluation) was a multicenter registry 
recording data on consecutive patients undergoing CR proce-
dures from 8 community hospitals. There were no prespeci-
fied selection criteria, and patients were treated according to 
physician preference. Data were collected locally and returned 
to a central repository where they were entered into a propri-
etary database. The protocol was approved by the Institutional 
Review Board for North Texas at Medical City Dallas Hospital 
with a waiver of consent.
Procedures were performed and data were collected over a 
6-month period from February 1, 2004, until July 31, 2004. All 
collected data were subjected to quality checks and validation 
tests. Follow-up was performed for between 12 and18 months 
and again starting in 2009, after which the database was locked. 
Follow-up included Social Security Death Index validation of all 
mortalities, hospital and physician inquiries, and letters and 
telephone calls to patients. Detailed medication history was 
taken from each patient at both the midterm (18 months) and 
late (5–7 years) follow-up. Patient responses concerning anti-
platelet therapy, therapy with lipid-lowering agents (LLAs), and 
β-blocker treatment were analyzed. Although the vast majority 
of single antiplatelet regimens consisted of acetylsalicylic acid 
(ASA) and the most common LLAs were statins, no distinction 
was made in this analysis in terms of specific agents or dos-
ages within the general categories. Patients with a diagnosis 
of ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction or status listed 
as salvage were deleted from the data set for this analysis. The 
primary end point was major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), 
which were mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and 
any repeat revascularization procedure.
Data were summarized and compared by use of χ2 statis-
tics for discrete variables and t test or ANOVA for continuous 
data. Propensity matching with 18 preoperative risk param-
eters (online-only Data Supplement Tables I–III) and account-
ing for nesting of patients in hospitals was used to minimize 
the selection bias introduced by clinician selection of CABG 
or PCI. The scores were put through a 1-to-1 greedy match-
ing algorithm that produced 1-equivalent data sets for PCI and 
CABG patients with ≥5 years of follow-up. Survival curves were 
derived with Kaplan-Meier methods with equality of distribution 
tested by the log-rank test, and hazard ratios (HRs) and cumu-
lative hazards were calculated from the Cox proportional haz-
ard model. Missing data on medications were dropped from 
analysis because there was no reliable mechanism to impute 
when the reasons for nonadherence are not known (online-only 
Data Supplement Table IV). All statistical calculations used SAS 
9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
results
The study sample consists of 973 CABG and 2255 PCI 
patients. As noted in the Table, clinical characteristics 
were different in many respects between the groups, 
with a higher incidence of smoking, cerebral and pe-
ripheral vascular disease, triple-vessel disease, reduced 
ejection fraction, and nonelective status in the surgical 
group and a higher incidence of prior procedures in the 
clinical Perspective
What is new?
• Multiple studies have compared coronary artery 
bypass graft (CABG) with percutaneous coronary 
interventions (PCI) for coronary revascularization. 
There is considerable evidence that adherence to 
medical therapy can affect the outcomes of thera-
peutic interventions. However, the long-term influ-
ence of compliance with evidence-based medical 
therapy on the comparative outcomes of CABG ver-
sus PCI remains to be defined.
• Here, we explore the effect of medication adher-
ence on the long-term comparative outcomes of 
CABG versus PCI in a multicenter clinical registry.
What are the clinical implications?
• Regardless of revascularization strategy, patients 
who adhere to appropriate medical therapy have a 
significantly improved major adverse cardiac event–
free survival.
• Among well-matched patients who are compliant 
with recommended medical therapy, there may not 
be a clinical benefit for either PCI or CABG.
• Among well-matched patients who are not compli-
ant with recommended medical therapy, there is a 
marked benefit for CABG over PCI.
• Results warrant confirmation in larger, more con-
temporary databases. If corroborated, a patient’s 
ability to adhere to medical regimen may affect the 
selection of optimal therapy for patients requiring 
coronary revascularization.

interventional group. Follow-up was 67±25.8 months 
(median, 84 months) for CABG patients and 61.8±28.6 
months (median, 79.4 months) for the PCI group.
When analyzed within groups, both antiplatelet medi-
cation and LLA therapy appeared to have a profound 
effect on MACE-free survival. Because ASA is a recom-
mended treatment for all CABG patients without specific 
contraindications, patients who were prescribed ASA at 
discharge and were reported to be on the drug at all fol-
low-up points (optimal medical therapy [OMT]) were com-
pared with those who either had not been prescribed 
ASA at discharge or were not on the drug at any point 
during follow-up (non-OMT). Figure 1A shows a dramatic 
difference in late MACE-free survival favoring appropri-
ate medical therapy (P=0.001). Similarly, CABG patients 
who left the hospital on LLA therapy and were still on the 
drug at all follow-up points enjoyed a markedly improved 
MACE-free survival compared with those who at any 
point were not on the medication (P=0.001; Figure 1B). 
Although β-blocker prescription at hospital discharge is 
a National Quality Forum standard for CABG patients, 
long-term β-blocker treatment is generally clinically 
based, despite emerging evidence of long-term benefit.5 
We therefore examined the effect of β-blocker therapy 
on long-term outcome and once again demonstrated a 
marked difference in event-free survival (P=0.001; Fig-
ure 1C). Because of the complex nature of medication 
adherence and the fact that our data do not permit us to

distinguish medication discontinuation for clinical cause 
from patient nonadherence, which is itself a complex 
construct, Cox regression was performed to determine 
independent predictors of MACEs in the CABG popula-
tion with OMT of each of these medication entered into 
the model. None of the single-medication regimens were 
independently associated with MACEs. However, lack of 
adherence to the combination of ASA and LLA therapy 
was strongly correlated with MACEs (HR=2.77; 95% 
confidence limit [CL], 1.69–4.55; P<0.001; online-only 
Data Supplement Tables V and VI).
Similar analyses were performed for the PCI group. Be-
cause OMT antiplatelet therapy, regardless of stent type, 
would require both ASA and a P2Y inhibitor at the time 
of discharge and continuation of ASA indefinitely there-
after,11,12 any patient who did not receive prescriptions 
for both at the time of discharge or who was not on ASA 
at any point during follow-up was considered non-OMT. 
The difference in MACE-free survival between groups was 
dramatic (P=0.001; Figure 2A). Similarly, because anti-
lipid treatment is recommended for all patients, a sur-
vival benefit was demonstrated that increased over time 
(P=0.001; Figure 2B). Although β-blocker therapy after 
successful PCI has not been studied in randomized, con-
trolled trials, in this study population, there was a MACE-
free survival benefit for OMT β-blocker therapy (P=0.001; 
Figure 2C). Cox regression of factors associated with 
MACEs in PCI patients identified that lack of adherence to 
either appropriate antiplatelet therapy (double antiplatelet 
regimen at discharge and ASA on follow-up) or LLA treat-
ment was strongly associated with MACEs (for antiplate-
let therapy: HR=2.87, 95% CL, 2.26–3.66, P<0.001; for 
LLA therapy: HR=1.99, 95% CL, 1.58–2.51, P<0.001). 
Similarly, adherence to both was predictive of MACEs 
(HR=2.79; 95% CL, 2.12–3.67; P<0.001; online-only 
Data Supplement Tables VII and VIII).
Because the role of long-term β-blocker therapy in 
CABG and PCI patients has not been fully elucidated, we

defined the OMT group as those patients who were tak-
ing both antiplatelet and LLA therapy OMT and examined 
the effect that treatment had on the relative outcomes 
for CABG versus PCI. Among patients who were not fol-
lowing the appropriate antiplatelet/LLA protocol, CABG 
patients enjoyed a much-enhanced MACE-free survival 
compared with those who underwent PCI (P=0.001; 
Figure 3A). However, among those on OMT, the benefit 
of CABG appeared to be considerably less (P=0.048; 
Figure 3B). Because CABG and PCI patients had differ-
ent risk profiles, matched groups of patients were cre-
ated in each group (online-only Data Supplement Tables 
I and II). Matched non-OMT patients still demonstrated 
a MACE-free survival benefit for CABG (P=0.001; Fig-
ure 4A). However, among matched patients taking OMT, 
there was no difference in outcome between CABG and 
PCI (P=0.574; Figure 4B). When the entire study popula-
tion was examined, with both approaches to revascu-
larization (CABG versus PCI) and medication (OMT ver-
sus non-OMT) entered into the model, Cox regression 
demonstrated that nonadherence to both OMT and PCI 
was associated with an increased incidence of MACEs. 
However, the association of OMT was in fact stron-
ger than that for the interventional strategy (non-OMT: 
HR=2.79, 95% CL, 2.19–3.54, P<0.001; PCI versus

Because propensity score matching resulted in 
groups that were smaller than the original cohorts, we 
further performed Cox regression of the entire patient 
population with propensity score entered into the model 
to look for interactions between choice of therapy (PCI 
versus CABG) and adherence or nonadherence to OMT.

benefit for CABG (HR for PCI versus CABG=1.88; 95%

discussiOn
Compliance with evidenced-based medical therapies is a 
complex construct of physician and patient behavior. It 
is well known that clinical practice guidelines frequently 
fail to change physician behavior.13,14 Even documented 
knowledge of the recommendations does not appear to 
necessarily influence performance.15 On the other hand, 
patient adherence rates to prescribed regimens are 
typically higher among patients with acute rather than 
chronic conditions and tend to drop rather dramatically 
after the 6 months of therapy.16,17 Even among clinical 
trial participants, adherence rates have been reported 
in the 43% to 78% range among patients receiving treat-

ment for chronic conditions.1 It is therefore essential to 
evaluate the effect of therapeutic options in a context 
that reflects actual clinical practice. As an observational 
study, the CARE registry was not designed to delineate 
the reasons behind medical decisions or the optimal 
therapeutic potential of those choices but rather to de-
fine the outcomes of medical care as it is actually de-
livered. The available data do not permit an analysis of 
reasons for the selection of CABG or PCI, nor do they 
suggest the causes of compliance or noncompliance 
with guideline-directed medical therapy. However, rea-
sonably long-term follow-up of an all-comer cohort of 
patients undergoing CR has clearly demonstrate several 
important points:
1. Regardless of revascularization strategy, patients 
who adhere to appropriate medical therapy have a 
significantly improved MACE-free survival.
2. Among well-matched patients who are adherent to 
recommended medical therapy, there may not be 
a clinical benefit for either PCI or CABG.
3. Among well-matched patients who are not adher-
ent to recommended medical therapy, there is a 
marked benefit for CABG over PCI.
These findings, however, are based on retrospective 
data derived from subgroup analyses of limited numbers 
of patients and can best be viewed as hypothesis gen-
erating.
Although these findings clearly warrant confirmation 
in other larger cohorts of patients, they are consistent 
with those of the 5-year follow-up from the SYNTAX trial 
(Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention 
With TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery),4 and their implica-
tions are far-reaching from both a clinical and a scientif-
ic point of view. Because CABG seeks to address down-
stream perfusion and PCI directly addresses the critical 
obstructing lesions, the benefits of CABG may be less 
subject to the need for appropriate medical therapy. 
Arterial grafting may further enhance the benefits of 
CABG in nonadherent patients,18 perhaps in the case of 
the internal mammary artery by nourishing downstream 
circulation with enhanced delivery of nitric oxide.19,20 
Therefore, among patients who might be anatomically 
suitable for either approach, for those who are unlikely 
to accept the rigors of careful medical therapy, CABG 
may be preferable to PCI. Because there is a spec-
trum of risk that people are willing to accept, including 
the risk of death, to avoid daily medication for cardio-
vascular prevention,21 surgery may provide the most 
reasonable long-term benefit. On the other hand, in an 
anatomically similar situation, if the patient is likely to 
carefully follow his or her medical regimen, PCI may be 
a more appropriate option. Indeed, many patients will 
prefer multivessel PCI to CABG even if the 1-year risks 
of death and repeat procedures far exceed those of 
CABG.22 Careful medical follow-up thus becomes criti-
cal in caring for such patients.
From the perspective of outcomes research, these 
findings suggest that any long-term comparison of these 
2 therapeutic approaches cannot be fully or appropriately 
evaluated without information on medication adherence. 
Although the literature is replete with such studies,7,8,23 
the effect of adherence to appropriate medical therapy on 
comparative outcomes has not been previously defined. 
The results of this observational study suggest both a dra-
matic effect of medication adherence on the long-term 
outcomes of each approach and a differential influence 
when these 2 approaches to CR are compared. These 
findings strongly suggest that future investigations of dif-
ferent approaches to CR should directly address the issue 
of adherence to OMT in the interpretation of findings.
liMitatiOns
As a retrospective, multicenter, observational study, pa-
tient groups may reflect multiple potential treatment bi-
ases. Although propensity score matching was used to 
attempt to account for differences between groups and 
multivariable modeling was used to adjust for poten-
tially associated risk factors, there may be patient and 
other factors for which statistical modeling cannot fully 
account. Medication history was based on patient re-
call, with its well-known limitations,1 although this been 
found to be effective,24,25 with no approach considered 
the gold standard.26,27 Moreover, we do not know the 
status of medical therapy between discharge and each 
of the 2 follow-up periods. Therefore, patient “per OMT” 
adherence may have been overestimated. Because we 
did not collect information on the rationale for treat-
ment, patients not taking medications may have had 
contraindications of which we were not aware. Indeed, 
contraindications or intercurrent disease states that 
may have necessitated the cessation of medication may 
have affected the primary study outcome (MACE-free 
survival) and thereby biased the study, although there 
is no a priori reason to believe that it would necessarily 
bias one group more than the other, especially among 
matched patients. Stroke data were not available in this 
study. The initial study reported a relative low incidence 
of periprocedural stroke (0.1% for PCI versus 0.7% for 
CABG; P=0.003)9; however, long-term outcomes sug-
gest a higher incidence of stroke in CABG patients.28 
How this might be influenced by compliance with medi-
cal therapy remains a fruitful area for further study. 
Not all patients were able to be provide complete infor-
mation on all medications. Although it may have been 
reasonable to assume that if a patient did not provide 
information on a medication, then he or she was not 
taking it, we elected a conservative approach of delet-
ing that missing information from the analyses, thereby 
assuming that the 80% to 90% completed responses 
were best reflective of the study population. The ab-
sence of benefit for CABG versus PCI in the patients

ostensibly following OMT must be viewed with caution. 
Although the signal of benefit for CABG appears to dif-
ferent in the adherent versus the nonadherent patients, 
especially among propensity-matched groups, results 
should not be interpreted to conclude that there is no 
benefit for CABG in these patients but rather should 
be viewed as hypothesis generating that adherence 
to medical therapy may have an effect on the relative 
MACE-free survival benefit of CABG versus PCI, a hy-
pothesis that warrants further testing in a larger, more 
contemporary patient population. Lastly, although the 
median follow-up for this study was 7 years, the impli-
cations of lifelong medical therapy for cardiovascular 
disease are controversial and require more careful, 
longer-term studies.29
cOnclusiOns
In the current era of CR, long-term results of a multicenter, 
community-based registry demonstrate that adherence to 
recommended medical therapies can have a profound ef-
fect on mortality and associated MACEs. This effect may 
be more compelling in the PCI than in the CABG patient 
population and may even be more important than choice 
of revascularization strategy itself. Knowledge of the rela-
tive effect of medication adherence can be extremely 
important in clinical decision making and should be ad-
dressed in all future comparative studies of CR strategies.
