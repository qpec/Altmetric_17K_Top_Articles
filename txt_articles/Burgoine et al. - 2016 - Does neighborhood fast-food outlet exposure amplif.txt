ABSTRACT
Background: Greater exposures to fast-food outlets and lower
levels of education are independently associated with less healthy
diets and obesity. Little is known about the interplay between these
environmental and individual factors.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to test whether observed
differences in fast-food consumption and obesity by fast-food outlet
exposure are moderated by educational attainment.
Design: In a population-based cohort of 5958 adults aged 29–
62 y in Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom, we used educational
attainment–stratified regression models to estimate the food-
frequency questionnaire–derived consumption of energy-dense “fast
foods” (g/d) typically sold in fast-food restaurants and measured
body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) across geographic information
system–derived home and work fast-food exposure quartiles. We
used logistic regression to estimate the odds of obesity (BMI $30)
and calculated relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) on an
additive scale. Participant data were collected during 2005–2013
and analyzed in 2015.
Results: Greater fast-food consumption, BMI, and odds of obesity
were associated with greater fast-food outlet exposure and a lower
educational level. Fast-food consumption and BMI were signifi-
cantly different across education groups at all levels of fast-food
outlet exposure (P , 0.05). High fast-food outlet exposure ampli-
fied differences in fast-food consumption across levels of education.
The relation between fast-food outlet exposure and obesity was only
significant among those who were least educated (OR: 2.05; 95%
CI: 1.08, 3.87; RERI = 0.88), which suggested a positive additive
interaction between education and fast-food outlet exposure.
Conclusion: These findings suggest that efforts to improve diets
and health through neighborhood-level fast-food outlet regulation
might be effective across socioeconomic groups and may serve
to reduce observed socioeconomic inequalities in diet and obe-
sity.

INTRODUCTION
Obesity is a risk factor for multiple chronic diseases, including
type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers. Nearly
two-thirds of adults are now overweight or obese in Great Britain,
with the prevalence predicted to increase further by 2050 (1).
These trends in obesity may be due in part to increased fast-food
(or “takeaway food”) consumption. Great Britain has seen
a 29% increase in financial expenditure on fast foods over the
past decade (2), and £28 billion worth of fast foods are now
purchased annually (2).
Foods consumed outside the home are typically less healthy
than those consumed at home (3). Fast foods (e.g., pizza, burgers,
and fried chicken) tend to be high in saturated fat and salt, energy
dense, nutrient poor (4), and served in large portions (5). The
regular consumption of meals from fast-food outlets (6) and the
increasing fast-food meal consumption frequency over time have
been associated with adult weight gain (7). Increased patronage
of fast-food outlets has also been associated with excess weight
gain over time (8).
The consumption of fast foods appears to be influenced by both
individual- and neighborhood-level factors. One individual-level
factor is socioeconomic status (SES),5 characterized in terms of
income, occupation, or educational attainment (9). Adults with
lower levels of education, in particular, have been reported to
consume unhealthy fast foods more frequently (10, 11) and to
visit fast-food outlets more often than those with higher levels of
education (12). These education-related differences in consumption

 have been implicated in the higher amounts of adiposity gen-
erally found in less-educated groups (13–15).
Neighborhood food environments, including those beyond the
residential neighborhood, may also be a cue for higher intakes of
fast foods. Although the evidence base is mixed and methodo-
logically heterogeneous (16), neighborhood exposure to fast-food
outlets has been associated with the purchasing (17) and con-
sumption (18–21) of fast foods. Positive associations between
exposure to fast-food outlets and body weight have also been
observed (18, 20, 22–26). For both fast-food consumption and
body weight, nonhome environmental exposures may be par-
ticularly influential, especially in the neighborhood surrounding
the workplace (27, 28).
Although both individual-level socioeconomic and neighborhood-
level drivers of diet and weight have been recognized, limited
research has examined how food environment associations
with food consumption and body weight might differ by SES.
Public health theories, such as deprivation amplification, have
long sought to understand whether, how, and why unhealthy
neighborhood environment exposures are more important for
populations of low SES (29). However, to date, empirical ev-
idence in support of this notion has been lacking, which con-
stitutes an important gap in knowledge. The purpose of this
study was to develop a more refined understanding of how
educational attainment might serve to modify previously ob-
served (18) main associations of fast-food consumption and
measured body weight with respect to combined home and work
neighborhood fast-food outlet exposure in Cambridgeshire,
United Kingdom.
METHODS
Study sample
The Fenland Study is an ongoing population-based cohort
study in adults aged 29–62 y (born between 1950 and 1975)
enrolled in general practices in Cambridgeshire, United King-
dom (www.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/research/studies/fenland-study/).
Cambridgeshire is a county in the east of England that comprises
urban, suburban, and rural areas and the major cities of Cam-
bridge and Peterborough. Recruitment for this study was con-
ducted by the University of Cambridge Medical Research Council
Epidemiology Unit from 2005 and is ongoing. At the time of the
data request for these analyses, data were available for 10,452
participants. Participants completed a general lifestyle question-
naire, which included questions on highest educational attainment.
Participants also completed a semiquantitative food-frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) to assess the habitual consumption of
foods; weight and height were measured by trained re-
searchers. Eligibility criteria for this analysis were as follows:
having complete demographic, anthropometric, socioeconomic,
and FFQ data and information on home and work address and
being employed. The analytic sample was therefore restricted to
6123 participants (see participant flow diagram in Supplemen-
tal Figure 1). The participant data used in this study were
collected between 2005 and 2013 and analyzed in 2015. All of
the study procedures were approved by the Health Research
Authority National Research Ethics Service Committee East of
England–Cambridge Central. The Fenland Study volunteers pro-
vided written informed consent.
Exposure: home and work fast-food outlets
Data on food outlet locations were sourced from local councils
throughout the study area in December 2011. The accuracy of such
data from local councils was shown previously (30). Fast-food
outlets were classified as shown in Supplemental Table 1 (30);
these are the types of food outlets to which new United Kingdom
local planning restrictions are beginning to apply. Chain super-
markets were also identified as those with a substantial share of
the United Kingdom grocery market (31). Food outlet locations
were geocoded at the postcode level by using a geographic in-
formation system. We previously described in detail the methods
used for defining food environment exposures at home and work
(27). Briefly, home and work neighborhoods were delineated as 1-
mile straight-line radius (circular) buffers, centered on home and
work addresses. A previous study suggested that this definition of
neighborhood was relevant to shopping behavior in a sample of
United Kingdom adults (32). The numbers of fast-food outlets
and supermarkets were summed within neighborhoods, with no
denominator necessary because of the consistent size of the buffer
used between participants. Counts of fast-food outlets were
combined (summed) across home and work neighborhoods as the
primary exposure in this analysis. To minimize residual con-
founding in multivariable models (18), counts of supermarkets
were also combined across home and work neighborhoods for use
as a covariate.
Outcomes: dietary intake and BMI
We had 3 outcome variables. First, we estimated the con-
sumption of energy-dense foods that can typically be obtained
from a fast-food outlet (although not exclusively)—here referred
to as “fast food”—using data from the FFQ. We summed the
consumption in grams per day of pizza, burgers, chips (fried
potatoes), fried fish, and fried chicken. Second, BMI (in kg/m2)
was calculated from measured height and weight. Third, those
with a BMI $30 were classified as obese.
Statistical analysis
We used linear and logistic regression models to examine
associations between educational attainment, fast-food con-
sumption (g/d), BMI, and odds of being obese. Educational at-
tainment groups were as follows: lowest (#11 y of education),
middle (12–13 y of education), and highest (.13 y of educa-
tion). We used general linear models to estimate adjusted mar-
ginal means with 95% CIs for fast-food consumption and BMI
across quartiles of combined home and work fast-food outlet
exposure. We then calculated subgroup-specific estimates of
fast-food consumption and BMI across education groups.
Following STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of OBser-
vational studies in Epidemiology) guidelines, we used logistic
regression with a single reference category (least exposed, most
educated) to estimate the separate and combined associations of
fast-food outlet exposure and educational attainment on the odds
of being obese (33). We tested for interaction on an additive scale
using relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), calculated as
RERI = OR11 2 OR10 2 OR01 + 1, where ORs are odds ratios
for being obese for those who are least educated and most ex-
posed to fast-food outlets (OR11), those who are least educated
and least exposed to fast-food outlets (OR10), and those who are

 most educated and most exposed to fast-food outlets (OR01) (33).
RERI scores .0 suggest a positive interaction or a greater risk
due to interaction than would be attributable to the additive effects
of each of these factors in the absence of one another (33).
All of the models were adjusted for known confounders
through the inclusion of a number of covariates: age, sex,
household income (,£20,000, £20,000–£40,000, or .£40,000/
y), combined home and work exposure to supermarkets, total
energy intake derived from FFQ data (kJ/d; for fast-food con-
sumption models only), physical activity energy expenditure
(kJ/kg per day) (34), and smoking status (for BMI and obesity
models only). Because many participants had incomplete data
for physical activity energy expenditure, measured by using
combined acceleration and heart rate sensors worn for up to 6 d
(35), the analytic sample for BMI models was further restricted
from 6123 to 5958 (Supplemental Figure 1). Our analytic sample
remained representative of the full Fenland Study sample across
key variables (Supplemental Table 2). All of the analyses were
conducted by using PASW Statistics 21 (SPSS Inc.).
RESULTS
Sample characteristics
Descriptive statistics for the analytic sample, overall and
stratified by educational attainment, are presented in Table 1.
Fast-food consumption was, on average, 9.7 g/d (32%) higher in
the least educated group than in the most educated group. BMI
was, on average, 2.0 units higher in those with the lowest levels
of educational attainment, and the percentage classified as obese
in the middle and lowest education groups was double the
number in the highest education group.
Associations of fast-food consumption, BMI, and obesity
with educational attainment
Greater fast-food consumption, higher BMI, and increased
odds of being obese were associated with lower educational
levels, with evidence of dose-response associations. Linear and
logistic regression results, with adjustment for age, sex, daily
energy intake (fast-food consumption model only), and smoking
status (BMI and obesity models only), are shown in Table 1.
Those who were least educated consumed an additional 11.3 g
fast food/d (95% CI: 9.6, 13.0 g/d) relative to those who were
most educated; they also had a BMI that was 2.0 units higher
(95% CI: 1.7, 2.4) and were more than twice as likely to be obese
(OR: 2.24; 95% CI: 1.83, 2.73) than those who were the most
educated. These associations were all highly significant (P ,
0.001). After additional adjustment for a number of covariates
including environmental exposures, those who were least edu-
cated still consumed significantly more fast food (b = 8.3 g/d; 95%
CI: 6.4, 10.2 g/d), had a significantly higher BMI (b = 1.8; 95%
CI: 1.4, 2.2), and were more than twice as likely to be obese (OR:
2.13; 95% CI: 1.71, 2.66) than those who were most educated.
Associations between fast-food exposure and fast-food
consumption
Greater fast-food consumption was associated with greater
fast-food outlet exposure, with evidence of a dose-response as-
sociation. Figure 1A shows the estimated mean fast-food con-
sumption per quartile of combined home and work fast-food
outlet exposure, with adjustment for known confounders and
educational attainment. Those who were most exposed to fast-
food outlets consumed 40.4 g fast food/d (95% CI: 38.2, 42.5 g/d),
which was significantly more than those in any other exposure
group and 6.0 g/d more than those who were least exposed.
Analyses stratified by education
Figure 1B shows the mean fast-food consumption per quartile
of fast-food outlet exposure, stratified by educational attainment.
Although fast-food outlet exposure remained positively associ-
ated with fast-food consumption across all education groups,
those who were most educated consumed the least at all levels of
exposure. On average across all exposure levels, those who were
least educated consumed 26% more fast food/d than did those
who were the most educated. However, high fast-food outlet
exposure did appear to further amplify differences in consumption
between education groups. Moreover, those who were least edu-
cated and most exposed to fast-food outlets consumed 46.6 g/d (95%
CI: 43.3, 49.9 g/d) and those who were most educated and least
exposed consumed 30.8 g/d (95% CI: 28.0, 33.7 g/d).
Associations between fast-food exposure and BMI
Greater fast-food outlet exposure was associated with greater
BMI, with evidence of a dose-response association. Figure 2A
shows the mean BMI per quartile of combined home and work
fast-food outlet exposure. Those who were most exposed to fast-
food outlets had a significantly higher BMI (27.3; 95% CI: 26.9,
27.7) than those in any other exposure group, which was 0.9
units higher than those who were least exposed.
Analyses stratified by education
Figure 2B shows the mean BMI per quartile of fast-food outlet
exposure, stratified by educational attainment. Although fast-
food outlet exposure was positively associated with body weight
in all education groups, being better educated was associated with
a lower BMI, and being most educated was associated with
a significantly lower BMI at all exposure levels. On average
across exposure levels, those who were least educated had a 1.8
unit (7%) higher BMI than those who were most educated.
Differences in mean BMI between those who were least educated
and most exposed (28.0; 95% CI: 27.4, 28.6) and those who were
most educated and least exposed (25.4; 95% CI: 24.9, 25.9) were
especially pronounced.
Increased odds of obesity (BMI $30) were associated with
increased fast-food outlet exposure and lower educational
level, with evidence of interaction on an additive scale. Table
2 shows logistic regression results for each combination of
fast-food outlet exposure quartile and educational level, with
a single reference category (least exposed, most educated).
The RERI was 0.88, indicating a positive additive interaction
and an excess risk of obesity for those who were most exposed
to fast-food outlets and least educated. Furthermore, greatest
fast-food outlet exposure was not associated with a signifi-
cantly increased odds of obesity for those in the middle and
highest education groups (Table 2, far right column), whereas
for those who were least educated, being most exposed was
significantly associated with more than twice the odds of

 obesity (OR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.08, 3.87). At every level of fast-
food outlet exposure, lowest education was significantly as-
sociated with greater odds of obesity (Table 2, bottom row)
(ORs: 2.07–2.18; all P , 0.05).
DISCUSSION
In this study, with its detailed information on combined home
and work environmental exposures and individual-level char-
acteristics including measured BMI, we confirmed earlier work
that showed that fast-food consumption, body weight, and the
likelihood of being obese are associated with neighborhood fast-
food outlet exposure (18, 22, 36) and educational attainment (10),
with evidence of dose-response associations. Associations with
fast-food outlet exposure were also observed in education-
stratified models, with differences in fast-food consumption and
BMI that were significantly different across education groups.
However, highest fast-food outlet exposure appeared to further
amplify differences in fast-food consumption across education
groups and was significantly associated only with odds of obe-
sity in those who were least educated. Evidence of additive
interaction in odds of obesity further suggested that the adverse
influence of highest exposure to fast-food outlets was exagger-
ated among those who were least educated.
Our results showed that although exposure to fast-food outlets
was consistently associated with fast-food consumption and body
weight across all education groups, there was a clear educational
gradient at every level of fast-food outlet exposure. Being more
highly educated was consistently associated with lower body
weight and lower intakes of energy-dense fast foods, which are
associated with excess weight gain over time (8). Further research
is required to determine the mechanisms by which low educa-
tional attainment confers increased vulnerability to unhealthy
neighborhood fast-food outlet exposures. The apparent protective
effects of education may, however, be attributed to the psycho-
social, behavioral, and economic resources commonly associated
with higher educational attainment. A 2010 study found that fast-
food outlet exposure was associated only with the frequency of
fast-food outlet visits for those with higher individual-level re-
ward sensitivity, a psychological trait hypothesized to confer
a greater responsiveness to unhealthy neighborhood environment
cues, and linked closely to SES (37). Other possible mechanisms

FAST-FOOD EXPOSURE AND INEQUALITIES IN OBESITY

 include less food and nutrition knowledge (38), fewer cooking
skills or inadequate cooking equipment (39), and lower income
(40) among low-SES groups.
To date, there has been limited evidence of the interplay
between individual SES and neighborhood exposures in re-
lation to health and health behaviors. For example, previous
research showed that in regions of the United Kingdom with
greater access to green space, income-related inequalities in
mortality were attenuated (41). With respect to neighborhood
food environments, a US-based study found that greater ex-
posure to fast-food outlets was associated with body weight
only among low-income individuals (36). Combining our ev-
idence of additive interaction together with the fact that fast-
food outlets tend to be more prevalent in deprived United
Kingdom regions (42) provides what is perhaps the first em-
pirical confirmation of the “deprivation amplification” hy-
pothesis in the area of diet and obesity (43). Deprivation
amplification may be an important contributor to established
socioeconomic gradients in diet and health in the United
Kingdom, the United States, and elsewhere.
Our results are of international significance because they
contribute to an emerging evidence base that suggests that
government policies to regulate neighborhood fast-food outlet
exposure might succeed in improving diets and health (18). Such
policies include restricting the proliferation of fast-food outlets in
a number of United Kingdom regions (44) and in South Los
Angeles (45). Critically, our results also suggest that these
policies will be effective across socioeconomic groups and
potentially serve to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in diet
and health. This is important because individual-level in-
terventions that rely heavily on individual agency for their
success have largely failed to reduce health inequalities (46).
Principally, this failure has been attributed to such policies
proving to be ineffective in groups of low SES (47), the population
demographic for whom environmental level approaches may be
most effective (41).
As detailed previously (18, 27), the limitations of our metric of
fast-food outlet exposure (which are not unique to this study)
include the following: the use of 1-mile straight-line radius
(circular) buffers to represent home and work neighborhoods,

 which may not necessarily match the participants’ own per-
ceptions of “neighborhood” or be congruent with actual food-
shopping behaviors in this sample; the lack of information on
residential history, which, if recent residential moves have been
made, could lead to exposure misclassification; some temporal
mismatch arising from the capture of food outlet data at only
1 time point (2011) within the period when participant data were
collected (2005–2013), which is a common consideration in
research of this type (16, 48); and not accounting for food outlet
exposure in wider activity spaces beyond home and work do-
mains, such as when commuting (27). In addition, we were not
able to account for time spent at home and at work, which could
moderate the effects of fast-food outlet exposures in these lo-
cations (49).
We used data from a semiquantitative FFQ to estimate the
consumption of energy-dense fast-food and total energy in-
takes. The results of FFQs are representative of usual dietary
intake and are commonly used in food environment research
(21) but are prone to systematic error (recall bias) and are less
detailed than 24-h dietary recalls or food diaries (50). Fur-
thermore, fast foods consumed could have been purchased from
non–fast-food outlets. Although we adjusted for exposure to
supermarkets, where fast-food–type foods are also available,
we cannot rule out residual confounding by way of access to
other food outlets.
We used highest educational attainment as our indicator of
SES. Other commonly used indicators include income and
occupation; however, these are generally imperfectly corre-
lated (51). We adjusted for household income in our models,
but it is possible that our results are sensitive to our selection
of socioeconomic indicator. Other limitations of this study
include its observational, cross-sectional study design, which
limits inference on causal relations. The associations ob-
served may reflect relocation of homes or workplaces to more
easily access fast foods, or the opening of fast-food outlets
where there is perceived demand, rather than the effects of
fast-food outlet exposure on fast-food consumption and body
weight per se. Our analysis was based on a sample of the
population of Cambridgeshire who were more highly educated
and less ethnically diverse than the United Kingdom pop-
ulation as a whole. This may influence the generalizability of
these findings.
This study contributes to the international scientific liter-
ature on neighborhood food environments, diet, and health by
furthering our understanding of the differential effects of fast-
food outlet exposure across education groups. For the first
time to our knowledge, we showed the individual and com-
bined effects of education and fast-food outlet exposure on
the consumption of energy-dense fast foods, measured body
weight, and odds of obesity in a large population-based
sample of adults. Although exposure to fast-food outlets aff-
fected all socioeconomic groups, those of a lower SES
consumed consistently more fast foods, tended to have higher
body weights, and were more likely to be obese. We also
showed how the association between exposure to fast-food
outlets and obesity was most pronounced for persons of lower
SES and how the combination of low SES and high fast-food
outlet exposure amplified the odds of obesity. Taken together,
these findings may hold implications for health inequalities
and therefore the development of public health policy.
