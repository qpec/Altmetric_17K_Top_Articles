Pain is an unpleasant experience. How the brain’s affective neural circuits attribute
this aversive quality to nociceptive information remains unknown. By means of
time-lapse in vivo calcium imaging and neural activity manipulation in freely behaving
mice encountering noxious stimuli, we identified a distinct neural ensemble in the
basolateral amygdala that encodes the negative affective valence of pain. Silencing this
nociceptive ensemble alleviated pain affective-motivational behaviors without altering
the detection of noxious stimuli, withdrawal reflexes, anxiety, or reward. Following
peripheral nerve injury, innocuous stimuli activated this nociceptive ensemble to drive
dysfunctional perceptual changes associated with neuropathic pain, including pain
aversion to light touch (allodynia). These results identify the amygdalar representations
of noxious stimuli that are functionally required for the negative affective qualities of
acute and chronic pain perception.
P
ain is both a sensory and affective ex-
perience (1). The unpleasant percept that
dominates the affective dimension of pain
is coupled with the motivational drive to
engage protective behaviors that limit ex-
posure to noxious stimuli (2). Although previous
work has uncovered detailed mechanisms under-
lying the sensory detection of noxious stimuli
and spinal processing of nociceptive information
(3), how brain circuits transform emotionally
inert information ascending from the spinal cord
into an affective pain percept remains unclear
(4). Attaining a better understanding of the
mechanisms underlying pain affect is impor-
tant, because it could lead to novel therapeutic
strategies to limit the suffering of chronic pain
patients.
The amygdala critically contributes to the
emotional and autonomic responses associated
with valence coding of neural information, such
as responses during fear or pain (5). Damage to
the basolateral amygdala (BLA) can induce a rare
phenomenon in which noxious stimuli remain
detected and discriminated but are devoid of
perceived unpleasantness and do not motivate
avoidance (6, 7). Conversely, impairment of som-
atosensory cortex function reduces the ability to
both localize noxious stimuli and describe their
intensity, without altering aversion or avoidance
(8, 9). Thus, BLA affective neural circuits might
link nociceptive inputs to aversive perceptions
and behavior selection.
Patients with chronic pain often suffer allodynia,
a pathological state in which an intense unpleasant
percept arises in response to innocuous stimuli
such as light touch (10). Notably, the BLA displays
heightened activity during chronic pain (11), and
longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imag-
ing studies in humans and rodents show that
neural hyperactivity and altered functional con-
nectivity in the amygdala parallel the onset of
chronic pain, suggesting that the BLA might
play a critical role in shaping pathological pain
perceptions (12–14). However, it remains unclear
how the BLA influences the unpleasant aspects
of innate acute and chronic pain perceptions
(15), while the role of nociceptive circuits in the
central amygdala are better understood (16, 17).
Previous studies attempting to define pain affect
mechanisms recorded the acute nociceptive re-
sponses of single amygdalar neurons in anesthe-
tized animals (11, 18). However, recent work has
shown that the BLA encodes information via the
coordinated dynamics of neurons within large
ensembles (19); it is therefore important to resolve
how the BLA processes pain affect at the neural
ensemble level in awake, freely behaving animals.
We first performed fluorescence in situ hy-
bridization studies and used the immediate-
early gene marker of neural activity, c-Fos, to
determine that c-Fos+ neurons activated by
nociceptive stimuli comprised a population of
mid-anterior BLA Camk2a+ principal neurons
(fig. S1). To identify how the BLA encodes
nociceptive information, we used a head-mounted
miniature microscope to track the somatic Ca2+
dynamics of individual BLA Camk2a+ principal
neurons in freely behaving mice presented with
diverse noxious and innocuous stimuli (Fig. 1,
A to D, and figs. S2 and S3) (20). We monitored
pain-related behaviors by measuring each ani-
mal’s locomotor acceleration, which allowed us
to track both reflexive withdrawal and affective-
motivational behaviors that include attendance
to the stimulated tissue and escape (Fig. 1, A
and E, and fig. S4).
Noxious heat, cold, and pin prick stimuli
elicited significant Ca2+ responses in 15 ± 2%
(SEM), 13 ± 2%, and 13 ± 2% of active BLA neu-
rons, respectively [3397 neurons (117 ± 8 neurons
per session)] (Fig. 1, F to H, and table S1).
Innocuous light touch induced Ca2+ activity
in a smaller subset of neurons (7 ± 1%) (Fig. 1,
F and I, and fig. S5E). Alignment of all stimulus-
evoked ensemble responses to the noxious heat
trials revealed an overlapping population of prin-
cipal neurons that encoded nociceptive informa-
tion across pain modalities (i.e., noxious heat,
cold, pin), which we refer to here as the BLA no-
ciceptive ensemble (24 ± 2% of active BLA neu-
rons) (Fig. 1, F to I).
This ensemble was composed of multimodal
responsive neurons, as well as a unique popula-
tion that appeared to encode nociception selec-
tively and no other sensory information (6 ± 1%
of all imaged neurons) (Fig. 1K and fig. S5G). Pain
behavioral responses evoked by noxious stimuli
closely mirrored the activity of this nociceptive
neural ensemble (Fig. 1, E and G, and fig. S4, D
and E). The nociceptive ensemble contained a
subset of neurons that maintained their noxious
stimulus response properties for more than a
week (11% of 3223 cross-day–aligned neurons)
(fig. S6). Increasingly salient stimuli, from light
touch (18 ± 3% of the nociceptive ensemble) to
mild touch (31 ± 4%), activated larger subsets of
the nociceptive ensemble (Fig. 1, G and I, fig. S5,
D and E, and table S1) and induced heightened
behavior (Fig. 1E and fig. S4). Expectation of
stimulus contact (“approach/no contact” trials)
also evoked sparse BLA activity (7 ± 2% of the
total population) (fig. S5, A to E, and table S1).
BLA activity did not correlate with exploratory
locomotion (fig. S7, A to E) (21).
To determine whether the BLA nociceptive
ensemble broadly encodes stimulus valence
(22, 23), we presented mice with an appetitive
stimulus (10% sucrose). Sucrose consumption
was encoded by a distinct ensemble (18 ± 3%
of all neurons) that only overlapped with a sub-
set of neurons in the nociceptive ensemble (7%
of total neurons) (Fig. 1J and fig. S5E) (19). Sim-
ilar to conditioned responsive valence networks
(23), neurons encoding unconditioned nocicep-
tive and appetitive information were spatially
intermingled (fig. S5, F, H, and I). Consistent
with these results, nociceptive c-Fos+ neurons

We next determined if the nociceptive en-
semble was engaged during aversive experi-
ences other than pain by presenting a panel of
sensory, but nonsomatosensory or nonnatu-
ralistic, aversive stimuli, including repulsive
odor, bitter taste, loud tone, facial air puff, and
electric shock. We found that while there was
overlap between the neural ensembles that en-
code nociceptive, aversive, and electric shock
stimuli (~10% of all imaged neurons), there re-
mained a subset of BLA neurons (~6% of im-
aged neurons) that responded only to naturalistic
nociceptive stimuli (Fig. 1K and fig. S8).
By analyzing the neural ensemble dynamics
with pattern classification methods, we were
able to classify and distinguish with high accu-
racy noxious stimuli from other aversive stimuli
(fig. S8E), supporting the finding that noxious
stimuli induce a distinct mode of BLA activa-
tion (supplementary text S1). Moreover, sensory
stimuli of different valences, intensities, and
modalities are represented by unique activity
codes. Noxious stimuli were encoded distinct-
ly from one another and could be distinguished

 with even higher fidelity from innocuous, non-
nociceptive aversive, and appetitive stimuli (Fig.
1L and fig. S9, A and B), indicating that there is
a core set of BLA neurons that encodes nocicep-
tive stimuli via specific dynamic neural codes.
One crucial finding was that greater activation of
this BLA nociceptive ensemble was predictive
of increased pain behaviors, suggesting that
BLA nociceptive processing influences the mag-
nitude of pain behaviors (Fig. 1M and fig. S7, H
and I).
To test the causal role of the BLA nociceptive
ensemble for pain behaviors, we expressed a
Cre-dependent inhibitory DREADD neuromo-
dulator (hM4-mCherry) in mutant TRAP mice
(FosCreERT2) by applying noxious pin pricks that
induced activity-dependent, spatially, and tem-
porally controlled DNA recombination and hM4-
mCherry expression (noci-TRAPhM4 mice) (Fig. 2,
A to C, and fig. S10) (25, 26). Since the BLA
encodes multiple modalities of nociceptive stim-
uli within a core ensemble (Fig. 1H), we hypo-
thesized that silencing the neurons activated by
noxious pin prickwouldalterbehavioral responses
to all types of noxious stimuli. Indeed, the hM4
agonist clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 10 mg/kg) sig-
nificantly reduced both attending and escape
behaviors, but not stimulus detection and with-
drawal, for both mechanical and thermal noxious
stimuli (Fig. 2, D to G, and fig. S11, A and B). CNO
alone had no effect on pain behaviors in control
mice (fig. S11C) (27). To test operant pain behavior,
we next allowed noci-TRAPhM4 mice to explore a
thermal gradient track in which the polar ends
were set at noxious cold (5 to 17°C) and hot (42 to
48°C) temperatures (Fig. 2H). The noci-TRAPhM4
mice injected with control saline rapidly acquired
an adaptive avoidance strategy of the noxious
zones. In contrast, noci-TRAPhM4 mice treated
with CNO visited the noxious zones more fre-
quently and for prolonged periods (Fig. 2, H to
J, and fig. S12). Similarly, inhibition of the BLA
nociceptive ensemble eliminated pain affective-
motivationalbehaviors inducedby the optogenetic
activation of peripheral primary afferent nocicep-
tors (fig. S13).
Whether pain and anxiety rely on common or
distinct BLA ensembles is unknown; therefore,
we placed noci-TRAPhM4 mice within an elevated
plus maze, in which anxiety drives avoidance
of the open arms (Fig. 2K). The noci-TRAPhM4
mice given either saline or CNO displayed equiv-
alent visits to and occupancy of the open arms
(fig. S14, A and B). Since nociceptive and

 sucrose reward-related information were en-
coded in divergent networks (Fig. 1J), we tested
the contribution of the nociceptive ensemble
to appetitive motivational drive during sucrose
preference training. CNO enhanced sucrose re-
ward in sucrose-naïve conditions (28) but had
no retarding effects on preference development
or on lick rates, relative to controls (Fig. 2L and
fig. S14C). Thus, this BLA nociceptive ensemble
transforms emotionally inert nociceptive infor-
mation into an affective signal that is necessary
for the selection and learning of motivational
protective pain behaviors.
We next investigated the contribution of
BLA neural ensemble activity to chronic pain.
A hallmark of chronic neuropathic pain is the
appearance of allodynia and hyperalgesia, both
pathological perceptual states in which aver-
sion is ascribed to innocuous somatosensory
stimuli and exacerbated in response to noxious
stimuli, respectively (Fig. 3A) (29). We hypo-
thesized that this pathological perceptual switch
might result from maladaptive transformations
in BLA coding. We tracked the longitudinal dy-
namics of BLA ensembles before and after the
development of neuropathic pain induced by
sciatic nerve injury (17,396 neurons, n = 17 mice)
(Fig. 3). Throughout the development of chronic
neuropathic pain, a subset of neurons stably en-
coded the nociceptive ensemble for both noxious
mechanical and cold stimuli (fig. S6). Nerve
injury did not significantly increase the spon-
taneous activity of the nociceptive ensemble
and overall BLA population (fig. S15, A and B).
However, BLA neural activity elicited in re-
sponse to light touch displayed a significant
expansion within the nociceptive ensemble
in neuropathic (291 ± 88% increase) but not
in uninjured mice (38 ± 14% decrease) (Fig. 3,
D to G, and fig. S15, C to E). The emergence of
this neuropathic coding schema was accom-
panied by the development of reflexive paw
withdrawal hypersensitivity and by enhanced
affective-motivational pain behaviors (Fig. 3, B
and C, and fig. S4, C to F). The magnitudes of

 the behavioral responses and the BLA nocicep-
tive ensemble Ca2+ activity were significantly
correlated before and after injury (Fig. 3H and
fig. S15F). These results suggest a role for the
BLA in the emergence of allodynia in chronic
pain states.
We next asked if we could prevent the neu-
ral transformation of light touch sensory infor-
mation into an aversive signal and eliminate
chronic pain unpleasantness by gaining genetic
access to the nociceptive ensemble with innocuous
stimuli in neuropathic TRAP mice. At 21 days
post–nerve injury, when allodynia had fully de-
veloped (fig. S16, B to E), we delivered a light
touch TRAP protocol to express hM4-mCherry
in the BLA nociceptive ensemble (neuropathic
TRAPhM4 mice) (Fig. 4, A and B, and fig. S16).
At day 42 postinjury, neuropathic TRAPhM4 mice
displayed significant allodynia and hyperalgesia,
for both reflexive and affective-motivational pain
responses, relative to uninjured mice (Fig. 4, C
to E). While the injection of CNO in neuropathic
TRAPhM4 mice did not alter reflexive hyper-
sensitivity (Fig. 4D), we observed a profound
decrease in neuropathic affective-motivational
behaviors, regardless of stimulus intensity or
modality (Fig. 4E and fig. S17, A and B). Un-
injured TRAPhM4 mice given the light touch
TRAP protocol expressed levels of hM4-mCherry
in the BLA that were similar to those of non-
stimulated control mice (Fig. 4B and fig. 2C),
presumably because the nociceptive ensemble
does not strongly encode innocuous information
under normal conditions (Fig. 1I). We observed
neither CNO-mediated changes in affective-
motivational pain behaviors in these uninjured
mice nor CNO effects on neuropathic reflexive or
affective-motivational behaviors in the absence
of hM4 expression (Fig. 4, C to E, and fig. S17, A
and B). In addition to tactile allodynia, patients
with neuropathic pain often report intense pain
in response to cold temperatures (cold allodynia).
We therefore ran neuropathic TRAPhM4 mice
through a two-chamber thermal escape-avoidance
assay in which the floor of one chamber was
cooled (from 30° to 10°C) (Fig. 4F). Uninjured
TRAPhM4 mice avoided the cold chamber, while
mice with nerve injury showed enhanced avoid-
ance, consistent with allodynia (Fig. 4, F and G).
Notably, CNO administration to neuropathic
TRAPhM4 mice generated a near-total indiffer-
ence between cold and neutral temperature
chambers (Fig. 4, F and G). Together, these
results indicate that the BLA nociceptive en-
semble is also necessary for the pain aversion
associated with allodynia and hyperalgesia dur-
ing chronic pain states.
Thus, disrupting neural activity in a nocicep-
tive ensemble in the BLA is sufficient to reduce
the affective dimension of pain experiences,
without altering their sensory component. The
unconditioned nociceptive ensemble described
here is a stable network of amygdalar principal
neurons that is responsive to a diverse array of
noxious stimuli. Within this ensemble, combina-
torial neural ensemble codes distinguish the

 various thermal and mechanical nociceptive
stimuli. These codes likely represent stimulus
modality, intensity, salience, and valence to
provide additional qualitative information that
enriches individual pain affect percepts (30). The
presence of a purely nociceptive-specific sub-
population of neurons within the larger BLA
nociceptive ensemble, distinct from general
aversion-encoding populations, suggests the
capacity for computing and assigning an ac-
companying “pain tag” to valence informa-
tion. This categorical signal could prioritize
the negative valence of intense noxious stim-
uli and scale the selection of conative pain
protective behaviors. It is thought that hier-
archical pathways transform low-level sensory
inputs into higher-order affective responses
(5, 31). Our chemogenetic manipulations suggest
that this critical node in the nociceptive brain
circuitry plays a critical role in shaping pain
experiences, by providing an evaluation of no-
ciceptive information that, in turn, intrinsically
motivates protective behaviors associated with
pain (32).
The phenomenological description of a pain
experience is normally that of a complex but
unified sensory and emotional perception that
can neither exist alone as an unanchored aver-
sive state nor stand merely on its emotionally
inert sensory qualities (33, 34). Though activity
within the BLA nociceptive ensemble cannot
account for the instantiation of the entire pain
experience, we propose that the BLA nociceptive
ensemble transmits abstracted valence informa-
tion to the central amygdala, striatal, and cortical
networks (35–37). For example, BLA neurons
projecting to the CeA may send a “pain tag” that
helps select for appropriate defensive responses
to impending or immediate threats (23) (supple-
mentary text S2). In parallel, connected cortical
regions might coalesce BLA affective signals with
sensory-discriminative information to process
them against prior experiences and internal states
for further evaluation at cognitive levels, all of
which contribute to the construction of a pain
experience (4, 38).
During chronic pain states, BLA ensemble
coding of innocuous somatosensory informa-
tion changes to engage the nociceptive ensemble,
leading to perceived aversion and protective
behavioral responses when encountering nor-
mally nonpainful stimuli, such as light touch.
Whether this change in ensemble activity re-
sults from peripheral or central sensitization
(3, 39), amygdalar input, or intra-amygdala
plasticity (11) remains an open question. Chronic
pain is not simply a sensory disorder but a neu-
rological disease with affective dysfunction that
profoundly impacts the mental state of millions
of pain patients (40). Clinical management of
chronic pain remains a staggering challenge,
given the heterogeneity of underlying causes,
and the overreliance on opioid analgesics has
contributed to the opioid epidemic (41, 42). Com-
prehensive strategies that provide substantive
relief across pain types are urgently needed (43).
To make progress along this translational path,
we have identified in the BLA a critical neural
ensemble target that mediates chronic pain un-
pleasantness. This findingmay enable the develop-
ment of chronic pain therapies that could
selectively diminish pain unpleasantness, regard-
less of etiology, without influencing reward, and
importantly, preserving reflexes and sensory-
discriminative processes necessary for the detec-
tion and localization of noxious stimuli (44, 45).
Collectively, our findings begin to refine the
neural basis and coding principles underlying
the multiple dimensions and complexity of the
pain experience for developing more effective
analgesic therapies.
