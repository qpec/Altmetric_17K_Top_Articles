Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a rare cancer type caused mainly by asbestos exposure. The median overall survival time of
a mesothelioma cancer patient is less than 1-year from diagnosis. Currently there are no curative treatment modalities for
malignant mesothelioma, however treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy can help to improve patient
prognosis and increase life expectancy. Pemetrexed-Cisplatin is the only standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy for malignant
mesothelioma, but the median PFS/OS (progression-free survival/overall survival) from the initiation of treatment is only up to
12 months. Therefore, new treatment strategies against malignant mesothelioma are in high demand. ONCOS-102 is a dual
targeting, chimeric oncolytic adenovirus, coding for human GM-CSF. The safety and immune activating properties of ONCOS-
102 have already been assessed in phase 1 study (NCT01598129). In this preclinical study, we evaluated the antineoplastic
activity of combination treatment with SoC chemotherapy (Pemetrexed, Cisplatin, Carboplatin) and ONCOS-102 in xenograft
BALB/c model of human malignant mesothelioma. We demonstrated that ONCOS-102 is able to induce immunogenic cell
death of human mesothelioma cell lines in vitro and showed anti-tumor activity in the treatment of refractory H226 malignant
pleural mesothelioma (MPM) xenograft model. While chemotherapy alone showed no anti-tumor activity in the mesothelioma
mouse model, ONCOS-102 was able to slow down tumor growth. Interestingly, a synergistic anti-tumor effect was seen when
ONCOS-102 was combined with chemotherapy regimens. These findings give a rationale for the clinical testing of ONCOS-102
in combination with first-line chemotherapy in patients suffering from malignant mesothelioma.
Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive and a rare form of
cancer that develops from mesothelium. MM is primary
caused by exposure to asbestos and exhibits a long latency
period,1 usually >30 years. The median survival time for
mesothelioma patients after diagnosis is typically only 9–12
months.2
MM
affects
the
pleura
(85.5%),
peritoneum
(13.2%), pericardium (0.5%) and tunica vaginalis (0.8%).3
MM tumors are often poorly responsive to standard therapies
and incidence is constantly increasing worldwide.2,4–7 The
low incidence of MM has for a long time limited the discov-
ery of new drugs,3 therefore, new treatment modalities are
highly needed.8
Oncolytic adenoviruses are promising and potentially
powerful immunotherapy tools for treatment of cancer. This
approach exploits the high immunogenicity of adenovirus.9,10
In addition, oncolysis releases tumor epitopes for processing
of antigen presenting cells (APC) and may ultimately lead to
the development of adaptive cellular immune responses
specific for tumor epitopes.11,12 Immunogenicity of adenovi-
rus can be further enhanced by arming the virus with an
immune-stimulatory transgene.13 The overall antitumor effi-
cacy can be potentially enhanced by combining viral immu-
notherapy with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.14–16
ONCOS-102 (Ad5/3-D24-GM-CSF) is a serotype 5 adeno-
virus, comprising a chimeric capsid for enhanced gene deliv-
ery to cancer cells and a 24 bp deletion in Rb binding site of

 E1A region for cancer cell restricted replication. ONCOS-102
is armed with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating fac-
tor (GM-CSF) for an enhanced immunostimulatory effect.11,17
Safety and immunological activity of ONCOS-102 has already
been demonstrated in a phase I clinical study.11,12 In this
phase I study, local treatment of pleural mesothelioma with
ONCOS-102 induced a systemic anti-tumor CD81 T cell
response and infiltration of CD81 T cells into tumors in the
last line refractory malignant pleural mesothelioma patient.
In practice, the treatment of malignant pleural mesothe-
lioma has remained unchanged since 2003.18 The most com-
monly used chemotherapeutic agents in MPM treatment are
Pemetrexed (Pemetrxed Disosium, Alimata), Cisplatin (Plati-
nol), Carboplatin (Paraplatin), (SoC chemotherapy) and their
combinations.19
Moreover recent elucidations on the type of induced cell
death20 has highlighted the importance of combining standard
chemotherapy with oncolytic viruses. In fact, it has been shown
that cancer cell death can be immunogenic or non-immuno-
genic.20 Immunogenic cell death (ICD) comprises changes in
the structure of the cell surface and leads to the release of pro-
immunogenic factors.21 Subsequently it attracts APCs to take
up tumor antigens, process them and finally elicit anti-tumor
immune response (specific anti-tumor T cells).20
The success of the cancer treatment, whether using chemo-
therapy, oncolytic viruses or a combination of the two, relies on
the induction of immunogenic tumor cell death and induction
of anti-tumor immune responses.22 It is known that some che-
motherapeutics23,24 and oncolytic adenoviruses25 act as potent
inducers of ICD, and thus have a beneficial impact on anti-
cancer immune responses, contributing to anti-tumor activity.
ICD can be evaluated by the presence of ICD biomarkers such
as calreticulin (CRT) in the outer plasma membrane, followed
by extracellular release of high-mobility group box 1 protein
(HMGB1) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP).21,22,26
In this study, we assessed an antitumor activity of
ONCOS-102 alone and in combination with first-line chemo-
therapeutics in vitro and in a xenograft model of human
malignant mesothelioma.
Material and Methods
Cell lines, virus and chemotherapeutic agents
Human epithelioid mesothelioma cell line JL-1 (ACC 596,
purchased from DSMZ, Germany) was cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 20%
heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine,
1% penicillin and streptomycin. Human malignant biphasic
mesothelioma
MSTO-211H
(ACC
390,
purchased
from
DSMZ, Germany) and human epithelial mesothelioma NCI-
H226 (H226, CRL-5826, purchased from ATCC, Manassas,
VA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10%
h.i. FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillin and streptomycin.
All cell lines were incubated at 378C with 5% CO2. The con-
struction and characterization of chimeric oncolytic adenovi-
rus coding for human GM-CSF (ONCOS-102) has been
described previously.17 ONCOS-102 was produced by Biovian
(Turku,
Finland) according to
good
laboratory
practice
(GLP) and stored at 2808C until use. Pemetrexed Disodium,
Cisplatin and Carboplatin were all purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX) and reconstituted in sterile
water before use.
Cell viability—In vitro tumor cell killing assay
Mesothelioma cells were seeded at 1 3 104 cells per well on
96-well plates. After overnight incubation the cells were
infected with ONCOS-102 with a viral particles/cell ratio of 10
(VP/cell). The virus and chemotherapeutic agents were diluted
in media containing 5% FBS. Pemetrexed, Cisplatin and Car-
boplatin were tested at the following sub-optimal, previously
selected
concentrations
of
0.625
mg/ml,
0.0026
mg/ml,
0.0625 mg/ml (H226 cells); 0.625 mg/ml, 0.0006 mg/ml,
0.0019 6 mg/ml (Jl-1 cells); 0.083 mg/ml, 0.0026 mg/ml,
0.0625 mg/ml (MSTO-211H cells), respectively. Eight different
treatment combinations were evaluated: ONCOS-102 alone,
Pemetrexed1 Cisplatin, Pemetrexed1 Carboplatin, ONCOS-
102 1 Pemetrexed1 Cisplatin (administered simultaneously),
ONCOS-102 1 Pemetrexed1 Carboplatin (administered simul-
taneously),
ONCOS-102 1 Pemetrexed1 Cisplatin
(priming:
virus first, chemotherapy
added
24 hrs after
infection),
ONCOS-102 1 Pemetrexed1 Carboplatin (priming: virus first,
chemotherapy added 24 hrs after infection) and mock (growth
media only). Cell viability was determined 3 days later by
CellTiter 96V
R AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay
(MTS) according to manufacturer’s instruction (Promega,
Madison, WI).
Analysis of apoptotic and necrotic cells in vitro
Mesothelioma cells were seeded onto six well plates at 5 3
105 cells/well. Cells were infected with 10 VP/cell of ONCOS-
102 and SUPPlemented with chemotherapeutics according to
What’s new?
Oncolytic adenoviruses are promising and potentially powerful immunotherapy agents for advanced cancer patients. Their effi-
cacy may be enhanced by combined therapy with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In this study, authors have shown a syner-
gistic antineoplastic activity of combinatorial use of ONCOS-102 with standard of care chemotherapy (Pemetrexed, Cisplatin,
Carboplatin) in human mesothelioma xenograft model in BALB/c nude mice. Presented findings support clinical application of
ONCOS-102 in combination with first-line chemotherapy for treatment of malignant mesothelioma.

 the treatment scheme mentioned above. The amount of apo-
ptotic and necrotic cells was measured 48 hrs later with a
TACS Annexin V-FITC kit by flow cytometer (Trevigen Inc.,
Gaithersburg, MD) according to manufacture�
rs instructions.
Immunogenicity of tumor cell death in vitro
CRT exposure.
Cell lines were seeded in duplicate onto 6
well plates at 5 3 105 cells/well. Cells were infected with 10
VP/cell of ONCOS-102 and/or with chemotherapeutic agents
according to the treatment combinations presented above. 24
(H226, Jl-1) and 48 (MSTO-211H) hours later cells were har-
vested and stained with 1:1000 diluted rabbit polyclonal anti-
Calreticulin antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 40 min at
48C and subsequently with 1:100 diluted Alexa-Fluor 488 sec-
ondary antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and analyzed by
flow cytometry (LSR II, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ).
HMGB-1 release.
Cell lines were seeded in triplicate onto 96
well plates at 1 3 104 cells/well and infected with 10 VP/cell
of ONCOS-102 and/or with chemotherapeutic agents accord-
ing to the treatment combinations presented above. 72 hrs
later, supernatants were collected and HMGB-1 was meas-
ured with an Elisa kit according to manufacturer’s instruction
(MBL International, Woburn, MA).
ATP release.
Cell lines were seeded in triplicates onto 96
well plates at 1 3 104 cells/well and treated as mentioned
above. Supernatants were collected after 48 (Jl-1, MSTO-
211H) and 72 (H226) hours and analyzed with ATP Deter-
mination Kit according to manufacturer’s protocol (Promega,
Madison, WI) for luminometric analysis (Varioscan Flash,
ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).
Virus infectivity in vitro—Immunocytochemistry assay (ICC)
Mesothelioma cell lines were seeded in five replicates onto 24
well plates at 3 3 105 cells/well and treated with eight differ-
ent treatment combinations mentioned above. 24 hrs later,
supernatant was aspirated and cells were fixed by incubation
with ice-cold methanol for 15 min. The determination of the
ONCOS-102 infectivity was based on visual quantification of
viral hexon protein in infected cells. Briefly, cells were stained
with 1:2,000 diluted mouse anti-hexon antibody (Novus Bio-
logicals, Littleton, CO) for 1 hrs at RT in the dark and subse-
quently with 1:500 diluted Biotin-SP-conjugated secondary
antibody (Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA) for 1
hrs
at
RT
in
the
dark.
Subsequently
the
Extravidin-
peroxidase was added at 1:200 and incubated for 30 min at
RT in the dark (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). Finally, the
infected cells were visualized by adding the stain: DAB up to
5 min (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). For each five replicates
(wells) five images of non-overlapping fields was acquired
using an AMG EVO XL microscope (ThermoFisher Scien-
tific, Waltham, MA). Infectivity data is presented as the aver-
age number of spots in five wells.
CAR, CD46 and DSG2 expression in mesothelioma
cell lines
CAR, CD46 and DSG2 expression level in H226, JL-1 and
MSTO-211H cells was assessed by staining with mouse
monoclonal anti-CAR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech, Dallas,
TX); mouse monoclonal anti-CD46 antibody (Abcam, Cam-
bridge, UK) and subsequently with 1:2,000 diluted Alexa-
Fluor 488 secondary antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK);
mouse monoclonal anti-DSG2 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge,
UK) and subsequently with 1:2,000 diluted Alexa-Fluor 488
secondary antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) respectively for
flow cytometry analysis (LSR II, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ).
Human mesothelioma xenograft model
Animal experiments were approved by the Experimental
Animal Committee of the University of Helsinki and the
Provincial Government of Southern Finland. Mice were
obtained from Scanbur (Karlslunde, DK) at the age of
6–8 weeks and quarantined for 1 week before the experi-
ment
started.
Mice
were
anesthetized
with
isoflurane
(Baxter, Deerfield, IL) and NCI-H226 cells in 50 ll were
injected into both flanks (6E 1 06/flank). Tumors were let
to grow 8 days prior to the treatments. Two pilot studies
have been performed prior the main experiment (Sup-
porting Information Figs. S1 and S2). In the main study
(Fig. 4) viruses were administered every 6 days. One
group received ONCOS-102 only, two groups received
ONCOS-102 and chemotherapy (Pemetrexed 1 Cisplatin
or
Pemetrexed 1 Carboplatin)
simultaneously
every
six
days, while two other groups received ONCOS-102 pri-
ming followed by combinatorial treatment of chemother-
apy (Pemetrexed 1 Cisplatin or Pemetrexed 1 Carboplatin)
and ONCOS-102 in 3-day cycles by turns. Mock animals
were treated with 0.9% saline. ONCOS-102 was diluted
into 0.9% saline and injected intratumorally at a dose of
5 3 107 VP per tumor (two tumors per animal). Injec-
tions were given in a fan-like pattern to ensure even dis-
tribution throughout the tumor. Pemetrexed, Cisplatin
and Carboplatin were diluted in 0.9% NaCl and adminis-
trated intraperitoneally at doses of 10 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg
and 8 mg/kg, respectively. The injection volume was
100 ll per chemotherapeutic agent.
Tumor size was measured with caliper on two dimensions
every 3 days, starting on the first treatment day. The longest
and shortest diameter were recorded and the tumor volume
was calculated using a formula of 0.52 3 length 3 (width)2.
The tumor size progression was indicated as percentage of
the first measurement point on Day 0 which was arbitrarily
set as 100%. All animals were observed for clinical signs,
morbidity or mortality daily during acclimation and adminis-
tration period and additionally 30 minutes after each treat-
ment. In the course of the experiment, the mice were killed
due to tumor reaching the maximum allowed (1.5 cm)
diameter.

Results
Combination with first-line chemotherapy improves the
in vitro efficacy of ONCOS-102 in mesothelioma
Oncolytic potency of ONCOS-102 was tested in three meso-
thelioma cell lines in vitro (Fig. 1a). MSTO-211H (malignant
biphasic), H226 (epithelial morphology) and JL-1 (epithelioid
mesothelioma) cells appeared to be relatively resistant to
oncolysis as 10 VP/cell (sub-optimal dose) killed 24%, 11%
and 18% of cells respectively in 3 days. H226 and JL-1 cell
lines were more resistant to chemotherapy-mediated cytotox-
icity compared to MSTO-211H cells (Pemetrexed 1 Cisplatin
or Pemetrexed 1 Carboplatin). Incubation with chemothera-
peutics only killed 11–12% of H226 and 10% of JL-1 cells in
3 days. In contrast, 63 and 73% of MSTO-211H cells were
killed by Day 3 in culture with Pemetrexed 1 Cisplatin and
Pemetrexed 1 Carboplatin,
respectively.
Compared
to
the
results observed in the single-treatment (virus alone and
chemotherapy alone treatment group), the combination of
ONCOS-102 with chemotherapeutics significantly increased
cytotoxicity in H226 and JL-1 cells. Slightly increased cyto-
toxicity was seen in MSTO-211H cells when chemotherapy
was combined with ONCOS-102 compared to virus alone
and chemo alone treatment group. In general, H226 and JL-1
cells were more resistant to both oncolysis (ONCOS-102
alone), and cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutics (alone)
than MSTO-211H cells which were particularly more sensi-
tive to chemotherapy. Importantly, ONCOS-102 combined
with chemotherapeutics showed a synergistic anti-tumor
effect (R > 1) in mesothelioma cell lines (Table 2).
In line with the cell viability results, the number of apo-
ptotic JL-1 and cells H226 was generally low in all treatment
groups, but a combination treatment slightly increased the
number of apoptotic cells in comparison to monotherapies.
The highest amount of the necrotic cells (within all tested
groups) has been observed in MSTO-211H cell line com-
pared to H226 and JL-1 cells (Fig. 1b). Similar trend in the
proportion of apoptotic cells was observed within three cell
lines at tested treatment regimes (Fig. 1c).
Immunogenic cell death and viral replication
Markers for immunogenic cell death, such as the exposure of
calreticulin to cell surface and the extracellular release of
ATP and HMGB1 were measured from mesothelioma cell
cultures after exposure to ONCOS-102, chemotherapeutic
agents, or combination of both. The most immunogenic
tumor cell death was induced by treatment with ONCOS-
102 1 chemotherapy in all cell lines (Fig. 2).
ONCOS-102 has shown its oncolytic property at different
concentration of viral particles in three tested mesothelioma
cell lines in vitro (Fig. 3a).
All mesothelioma cells lines (MSTO-211H, H226 and
JL-1) expressed high level of CD46 (98, 96 and 98%, respec-
tively) and DSG2 (95%, 7% and 64% respectively) on their
surfaces. Finally, H226 (88%) and Jl-1 (15%) expressed CAR,
while MSTO-211H was negative for CAR (Fig. 3b).
We also assessed the impact of chemotherapy on ONCOS-
102 replication in vitro (Fig. 3c). The combination of ONCOS-
102 and chemotherapeutics significantly decreased the number
of infected cells as compared to the control cells treated with
each agent alone (p < 0.001 vs. ONCOS-102).
ONCOS-102 in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin
or carboplatin showed improved anti-tumor efficacy in
human xenograft mesothelioma model
In order to study the synergy of oncolytic virus and chemothera-
peutics on anti-tumor treatment we have performed animal study.

 according to the treatment regime presented in Table 1. Tumors
appeared to be refractory against standard chemotherapeutics
(Pemetrexed1 Cisplatin, Pemetrexed 1 Carboplatin), as none of
the treatments significantly reduced tumor growth (Fig. 4a, Sup-
porting Information Figs. S1 and S2). Chemotherapy alone was
the most inefficient treatment modality against mesothelioma,
probably in part due to the suboptimal dose regimen used. One
animal
treated
with
ONCOS-1021 Pemetrexed1 Cisplatin
showed a complete tumor regression (both tumors) by Day 21.
In
addition,
one
animal
treated
with
ONCOS-102
pri-
ming1 Pemetrexed1 Cisplatin showed a complete regression of
both tumors by Day 45. Indeed, this regimen was the most effec-
tive with 97% of initial tumor size at Day 60 vs. 473% (mock),
563% (Pemetrexed 1 Cisplatin) and 672% (Pemetrexed and Car-
boplatin). Additionally, in all combination regimes (ONCOS-
1021 chemotherapy) we observed the most significant anti-
tumor activity compared to other groups (e.g. initial tumor size:
97% (virus priming 1 Pemetrexed1 Cisplatin), 138% (virus1
Pemetrexed1 Cispaltin) vs. 206% (virus alone), 473% (mock),
563% (Pemetrexed1 Cisplatin) at Day 60), (Fig. 4a). Importantly,
ONCOS-102 combined with chemotherapeutics showed a strong
synergistic anti-tumor effect (R> 1) on Day 21, 48 and 60 (Table 2).
ONCOS-102 replicates locally in tumor and produces
human GM-CSF
Quantification for adenovirus E4 copy number and the level
of human GM-CSF in murine organs (tumor, liver) and
serum was done by qPCR and ELISA. ONCOS-102 was pres-
ent only in tumors (locally). Adenoviral particles were not
detected in serum or liver in any of the groups (Fig. 4d).
Additionally, we detected human GM-CSF produced by
ONCOS-102, and the highest concentration was detected in
tumors (Fig. 4c).
Discussion
Mesothelioma is a treatment-resistant cancer to standard
therapies with no effective curative options for advanced can-
cer patients.2,4 The most effective standard treatment against
MM to date is a combination of Pemetrexed and Cisplatin,
with a 41% response rate (RR).1,27
In preclinical studies, the combination of Pemetrexed with
Cisplatin presented activity against human non-small cell
lung
cancer
cell
lines,
suggesting
potential
benefit
in
MPM.27,28 This combination caused a greater than additive
growth delay in H460 human non-small cell lung carcinoma

 (NSCLC) and Calu-6 NSCLC xenografts in nude mice.29 In
the phase III EMPHACIS trial, an improved overall survival
was seen, when patients were treated with the combination
versus Cisplatin alone. The median survival of patients in the
combination group was 12 months compared to a median
survival of 9 months in patients treated with only Cisplatin
(p 5 0.02).29 Subsequently, FDA approved this combination
for the treatment of unresectable MPM (500 mg/m2 and
75 mg/m2 respectively).30 Due to high toxicity of Cisplatin in
many mesothelioma patients, Carboplatin has been tested as
an alternative.31 Although this combination improves the sur-
vival of mesothelioma patients compared to single-agent
chemotherapy,1,32 MM is still a lethal disease with a median
PFS/OS of 12 months from the initiation of treatment, and
thus, new treatment modalities are needed.
Importantly, it has been shown that oncolytic adenovirus
and doxorubicin-based chemotherapy resulted in synergistic
antitumor activity against soft-tissue sarcoma.23 To this end,
we decided to combine chemotherapy with ONCOS-102 in
order to enhance anti-tumor effect. In addition to that, our
findings will be used in clinical study design toward mesothe-
lioma treatment, since ONCOS-102 replicates specifically in
tumors and shows high tropism toward mesothelioma cells.
Tumors are highly heterogeneous complex of cells, con-
taining stromal cells, cancer cells, tumor infiltrating lympho-
cytes (TILs) like regulatory T cells (Tregs) which stimulate
tumor progression and maintain an immunosuppressive envi-
ronment.32 Tumors develop many mechanisms for evading
the innate immune responses.33 Many cell types such as
Tregs, myeloid suppressor cells (MDSC) and type 2 macro-
phages
(M2)
negatively
regulate
anti-tumor
immune
responses. Additionally, tumors themselves can promote sup-
pression of antitumor immunity by expression of inhibitory
ligands such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1),34 pro-
grammed death-ligand 2 (PDL2),35 NKG2D and MICA/B
that inhibit the functionality of natural killer (NK) and T
cells36 and accelerate the production of immunosuppressive
CD41 T cells.37 Further, soluble mediators (IL-10, histamine,
hydrogen peroxidase, adenosine) produced by tumor cells
can block cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).38 Therefore, effi-
cacy and antitumor responses induced by monotherapy may
not be sufficient to eradicate cancer cells.

Anti-tumor efficacy of immunogenic adenovirus ONCOS-102

 Oncolytic viruses exhibit different mechanism of action
from
conventional anticancer approaches (chemotherapy,
radiotherapy), giving a possibility for additive or synergistic
interactions in cancer therapy. Further, combined therapies
may lead to reduced toxicity and increased efficacy, without
additional side effects.
This study was designed to evaluate the oncolytic potency
of ONCOS-102 in combination with SoC chemotherapy in
human mesothelioma xenograft model.
The immunomodulatory functions of the transgene GM-
CSF are a central mechanism of action of ONCOS-102.13,17
Further, adenovirus itself is a strong activator of the immune
system and this significantly contributes to the overall anti-
tumor efficacy of the virus.13 Previously it has also been
shown that ONCOS-102 produces functional human GM-
CSF, inducing tumor-specific immunity23,39 indicating that
GMC-SF might be involved in the recruitment of dendritic
cells (DC) and activation at the tumor site, leading to subse-
quent stimulation of T-cells and finally, induction of anti-
tumor immunity. Unfortunately, in our mesothelioma cancer
model, immune modulatory functions of GM-CSF have been
lost due to the immunodeficient nature of the chosen murine
xenograft model. However, GM-CSF utility in immune sys-
tem modulation against mesothelioma has been already
shown in a phase I clinical study, where clinical data demon-
strated that ONCOS-102 was able to prime a tumor specific
immune response (induction
of cytotoxic tumor-specific
CD81 T cells) in chemotherapy refractory malignant pleural
mesothelioma patient.11,12
Most of chemotherapeutics induce cancer cell death by
triggering
an
immune
responses
against
cancer.22
ICD
involves specific changes in the composition of the cell sur-
face (Calreticulin) as well as the release of soluble biomarkers
(ATP and HMGB1). Such mediators interact with the recep-
tors on the surface of APCs and lead to the presentation of
tumor antigens to T cells, determining a long-term success of

ment. (a) Oncolytic efficacy of ONCOS-102 (0.1; 1; 10; 100 and 1,000 VP/cell) was measured by MTS cell-viability assay 3 days post the
treatment initialization. Cell viability profile was determined against untreated cells (mock). (b) Mesothelioma positive cells for CAR, DSG2
and CD46 were measured by flow cytometry, followed by specific antibody staining. (c) ONCOS-102 infectivity assay was performed for
three treatment groups. The determination of the ONCOS-102 infectivity was based on visual quantification of infected cells after the stain-
ing of virus hexon protein and finally the calculation for detected spots. For each five replicates five images of non-overlapping fields have
been acquired using an AMG EVO XL microscope. For infectivity comparison, the data have been presented as the average number of spots
in five wells. Error bars, mean 6 SEM: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.

 anticancer therapy.21 It is well studied that the efficacy of
anticancer chemotherapies is related to cytotoxic effects of
the antineoplastic agent on tumor cells. Chemotherapeutics
can stimulate immune effector cells either directly or by
restoring
the
immunosuppressive
environment
inhibiting
antitumor immune responses.40 Additionally, some chemo-
therapeutics induce tumor cell death in such a way that spe-
cific immune responses are evoked.41
Ads are excellent immunotherapeutic vectors with proper-
ties to prime and boost immune responses. Oncolytic adeno-
viruses
lead
to
immunogenic
cancer
cell
death
and
subsequent release of tumor specific antigens for APC cells,
resulting in the priming of potent tumor-specific immunity.12
The combination of oncolytic viruses with chemotherapy has
a potential for improved anticancer efficacy and induction of
antineoplastic immunity. Further, armed ONCOS-102 with
chemotherapy can be a powerful tool in order to overcome
the major obstacle of immune suppressive microenvironment
in tumor42 due to the immunogenic tumor cell death21–24 it
causes and the subsequent induction of anti-cancer immune
responses.22,43,44
We have shown that both ONCOS-102 and chemothera-
peutics induce ICD in a preclinical setting. Our findings sug-
gest that their combination elevates immunogenic cell killing
in vitro, further suggesting that the virus-induced ICD plays
a part in the antitumor T-cell activation observed in humans

 treated with ONCOS-102.11,12 The molecular mechanisms
underlying this phenomenon is sill unknown, however several
hypothesis can be put forth. Further, the production of ade-
novirus E1A proteins has been shown to sensitize cancer cells
to chemotherapy-induced cell killing and chemotherapeutics
have also been shown to change the viral tropism toward the
cancer cells.45 Importantly, ICD seems to be beneficial or
even necessary for the induction of anticancer immunity and
efficacy, and is in conjunction with exposure and release of
ATP and HMGB1.44
In our studies combined treatment showed synergistic
effects and was the most effective therapy against mesothe-
lioma (over SoC therapy) thus we suggest that ONCOS-102
combined with SoC can be used as a new treatment modality
against mesothelioma. Our observations are in line with our
previously reported findings where ONCOS-102 combined
with Doxorubicin resulted in synergistic antitumor effect
against soft tissue sarcoma (STS) in Syrian hamsters.23 Similar
finding has been reported when combining Ad5/3-delta24 and
gemcitabine, resulting in synergistic effect to ovarian cancer
in vitro and in vivo.46 Similar findings have been reported as
well by many other research groups testing various combina-
tions of oncolytic viruses with chemotherapeutic agents. The
combinatory therapy of reovirus and Cisplatin synergistically
improved anticancer properties in human and murine mela-
noma cell lines in vitro and murine tumors in vivo.47 Triple
combination therapy with reovirus, Cisplatin and Paclitaxel
demonstrated synergistic cytotoxic effect in vitro in head and
neck cancer, giving a rationale for clinical study.48 Also the
combination of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) with standard
of care chemotherapeutics agent 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) has
shown synergistic effect on different tumor cell lines in vitro.
The combination of virus and chemotherapy had the strongest
cytotoxic efficacy than virus and 5-FU alone, suggesting this
treatment regime for new adjuvant therapy.49 Next the appli-
cation of herpes simplex virus (G207) in combination with
Paclitaxel and Doxorubicin for the therapy of ATC (anaplastic
thyroid cancer) in vitro and in vivo has shown anticancer syn-
ergy as well. Combinatory therapy (G207 plus Paclitaxel) in
athymic nude mice bearing KAT4 flank tumors significantly
reduced tumor volume compared with virus, chemotherapy
and control alone. Importantly no morbidity in vivo has been
reported in combinatory treatment group.50
In summary our findings support combining ONCOS-102
with standard of care chemotherapy for the treatment of
malignant pleural mesothelioma.
