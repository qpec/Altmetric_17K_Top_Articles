 Social isolation and frequent attendance    |    2 
Abstract 
Background. Frequent attenders in primary care have complex physical and mental 
healthcare needs as well as low satisfaction with their healthcare. Interventions targeting 
mental health or psychoeducation have not been effective in reducing attendance. Here, we 
test the proposition that both frequent attendance and poor health are partly explained by 
unmet social needs (i.e., limited social group support networks).  
Methods. Study 1 (N=1752) was a large cross-sectional community sample of primary care 
attenders in Scotland. Study 2 (N = 79) was a longitudinal study of a group of young people 
undergoing a life transition (moving countries and commencing university) that increased 
their risk of frequent attendance. Study 3 (N=46) was a pre-post intervention study examining 
whether disadvantaged adults who joined a social group subsequently had reduced frequency 
of primary care attendance.     
Results. All three studies found that low social group connectedness was associated with a 
higher frequency of primary care attendance. This was not attributable to poorer health 
among those who were socially isolated. In Study 3, joining a social group led to reduced 
primary care attendance to the extent that participants experienced a (subjective) increase in 
their social group connectedness.  
Conclusions. Unmet social needs among frequent attenders warrant closer consideration. 
Interventions that target social group connectedness show promise for reducing 
overutilization of primary care services.

Social isolation predicts frequent attendance in primary care 
Frequent attenders in primary care warrant research investigation for at least three 
reasons. The first is economic: the top 10% of attenders account for 30-50% of appointments 
with general practitioners (GPs; 1), and are therefore a considerable strain on the healthcare 
system. If the needs of this population could be served in less practitioner time, this would 
reduce waiting times and improve outcomes for all patients. A second reason for concern is 
that these patients are typically dissatisfied with the quality of healthcare they receive (2). 
This is reflected in their ongoing health profile, which is typically one of complex physical 
and mental illness and slow decline over time. This suggests that the primary care model is 
one that may not be optimally suited to the needs of the frequent attender population (3, 4). A 
third reason why frequent attenders warrant further research is that they are often cited by 
physicians as a cause of occupational stress and burnout (5, 6): these are “heartsink” patients 
who challenge one’s sense of professional competence and efficacy.   
Perhaps unsurprisingly, relative to other patients, frequent attenders are more likely to 
be experiencing poor physical health as well as poor mental health (7), usually reporting 
several comorbid chronic diseases that require ongoing management (2, 8). Frequent 
attendance in primary care is, of course, at least in part attributable to this health profile, 
although researchers have generally agreed that undiagnosed mental illness and somatization 
are also major contributors to frequent attendance (9-12). Demographically, frequent 
attenders are typically older women and they are more likely to be socioeconomically 
disadvantaged (13, 14).  
Several interventions have been trialled to reduce frequent attendance, in the interests 
not only of triaging resources but also of improving patient outcomes and reducing physician 
burnout. A review (15) identified 5 randomised controlled trials that have been conducted to 
assess 4 different interventions, all of which focused either on mental health, 
 Social isolation and frequent attendance    |    4 
psychoeducation, or some combination thereof. Although two of these interventions led to a 
reduction in depression symptoms (16, 17), unfortunately, none improved quality of life. 
Moreover, none of these interventions reduced primary care attendance, and in fact, one 
intervention lead to a significant increase in frequency of attendance (16, see also 18). These 
disappointing results suggest the need for further research – not only to trial novel approaches 
to intervention, but also to test alternative hypotheses about the causes of frequent attendance 
and the specific needs of this population.  
Social isolation and frequent attendance 
It is interesting that, despite low satisfaction with health services, frequent attenders 
continue to present in primary care. A functional behaviour approach (19) would suggest that 
the persistence of attendance indicates that it meets some need of patients. A study by Carter 
and colleagues (20) is relevant here, although it targeted frequent attenders at Accident and 
Emergency, rather than primary care. This study found 8 regular “check in” postcards from 
hospital staff reduced suicidal readmissions by 50% over a five-year follow-up. This study 
hints that social factors and not merely medical factors may play a role for at least some 
frequent attenders.   
Consistent with this, previous research has indicated that frequent attenders are more 
likely to be experiencing interpersonal problems (21, 22) and to be socially isolated, both 
objectively (i.e., divorced, unemployed) and subjectively (i.e., lonely; 23). This is also in line 
with epidemiological literature, which has found that social exclusion (often due to 
stigmatised group memberships) co-occurs with socioeconomic disadvantage and poor 
health, and that the vast majority of people affected by such exclusion are women (24, 25). 
This is relevant because there is a large and robust evidence base demonstrating that social 
isolation is aversive (26, 27), and that people engage in a variety of strategies to counteract it. 
We propose that for some marginalised members of the community, their primary care 
 Social isolation and frequent attendance    |    5 
physician may be one of the few forms of regular, supportive contact that is socially 
sanctioned and affordable. Social isolation may therefore directly predict increased frequency 
of attendance.  
Furthermore, social isolation is also a well-established risk factor for ill-health (28, 
29), with some meta-analyses suggesting that social isolation is a stronger predictor of 
mortality than some more “common suspects” such as obesity and hypertension (30, 31). 
Much of this research has focused on social group connectedness, in the form of subjective 
self-definition in terms of particular group memberships (e.g., a teacher, a member of the 
church, a metalhead). Studies have suggested that group memberships not only protect 
against a decline in mental health (32), but that they are also associated with fewer health risk 
behaviours such as smoking (33, 34). The benefits of social group membership for health 
have been shown to also be strong among vulnerable communities, such as people 
experiencing homelessness (35) and people recovering from trauma (36).  
The Current Project 
We conducted three studies to test the degree to which social isolation might affect frequent 
GP attendance – either directly, or indirectly via its detrimental effect on health. Table 1 
summarises the population, design, and analytic approach of each study. Across all three 
studies, we operationalised social isolation as the lack of subjectively meaningful connections 
to social groups. This approach is consistent with the emerging evidence base that social 
identity derived from membership in groups is the ‘active ingredient’ in social connectedness 
that provides its protective health benefit (e.g., 37, 38, 39). Study 1 was a cross-sectional 
study of all consenting patients at a stratified sample of five GP clinics from across Scotland. 
Study 2 involved a natural experiment looking at the longitudinal effect of a life transition 
(moving overseas to study) on social group connectedness, health, and primary care use. 
 Social isolation and frequent attendance    |    6 
Study 3 investigated the utility of an intervention with disadvantaged adults to increase social 
group connectedness as a means to improve health and reduce primary care attendance.  
Analytic Approach 
All three studies utilised hierarchical regression analyses to assess whether social 
group connectedness predicted frequency of primary care attendance (H1, H3 and H6). Study 
3 additionally assessed whether frequency of attendance changed over time using a t-test 
(H5). All three studies then assessed whether this relationship could be accounted for by 
health status, conceptualised in terms of physical health (Study 1, H2), mental health (Study 
2, H4), or subjective wellbeing (Study 3, H7). In all studies, health status was assessed both 
as a covariate in hierarchical regression analyses, then as a potential mediator in mediation 
analyses (using PROCESS Model 4, Hayes, 2012, 40).   
Study 1 
Study 1 involved a large community sample of Scottish adults and assessed the 
relationship between social group connectedness and frequency of primary care 
appointments: (1) over and above the effect of demographic factors known to be associated 
with frequent attendance (age, gender, and socioeconomic status); (2) over and above the 
effect of objectively measured indicators of chronic disease (systolic blood pressure, body 
mass index and the number of medications prescribed in the last six months). Systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) and body mass index (BMI) were chosen as measures of physical health for 
four reasons: (a) they are primary indicators of ‘metabolic syndrome’, including 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes and stroke, (b) they are established risk factors for frequent 
attendance, (c) data were available for the majority of people in the sample and (d) these are 
objectively measured indicators, which may be more reliable and valid than physician-
recorded diagnoses or self-reported symptoms. Together with number of drug prescriptions 
each patient had received, these measures of health status were taken from patient’s health 
 Social isolation and frequent attendance    |    7 
records as a proxy for the multiple chronic physical conditions that are often associated with 
frequent attendance.  
The first hypothesis (H1) stated that social group connectedness would negatively 
predict the frequency of primary care attendance. The second hypothesis (H2) stated that the 
effect of social group connectedness on attendance would not be fully accounted for by the 
effect of health status. H2 was tested in two ways, first by adding indicators of health status 
to the regression model as covariates (H2a), and second using a mediation analysis whereby 
we expected the direct effect of social group connectedness on frequency of attendance to 
remain significant after accounting for any indirect effect via health status (H2b).  
Study 1 Method 
Participants were patients from five GP surgeries in three diverse locations across 
Scotland (some rural, some urban, some high SES, some low SES). Each GP surgery posted 
participation invitations to all their patients for whom the study was deemed suitable (those 
over the age of 18 who did not possess terminal illnesses or conditions such as dementia or 
Alzheimer’s disease). This was a total of 21,165 patients. Of these, 2508 patients (11.85%) 
returned the reply slip included with the invitation. These patients received a consent form 
and a questionnaire via post. 1824 patients (henceforth participants) completed and returned 
this questionnaire (1054 females; 770 males, Mage = 57.55 years, SD = 14.57, range = 18-97 
years); 1752 provided sufficient information on the variables of interest to be included in our 
analyses. Shortly afterwards, the second author visited each of the GP surgeries and collected 
relevant medical data for each of the participants from the surgery databases.  
Measures.  
Frequent attendance. Patients’ attendance records at primary care were accessed for 
the preceding 6 months. On average, patients had visited their primary care clinic 3.83 times 
 Social isolation and frequent attendance    |    8 
in the last six months (SD = 5.50; range 0–70 visits). In total, 74.3 percent of patients had 
visited their doctor in the last six months.  
Social group connectedness. We measured identification with the family, the local 
community, and a third group of the participant’s choice. For each of the three groups, 
participants completed the four-item Group Identification Scale (33), which has been widely 
used in the investigation of the relationship between social groups and health (e.g., 41, 42). 
Each item was rated on a 1-7 scale (higher values = stronger identification), and the overall 
mean was found for each group. In accordance with validation studies, a participant was 
considered to identify with a particular social group if they scored 5 or more for that group 
(34, 43). We then counted the number of groups with which the participant identified 
(ranging between 0 and 3; M = 2.18, SD = .90).   
Body Mass Index. BMI was calculated from physician-recorded height and weight. 
Only participants who had their weight recorded by their primary care physician a maximum 
of 365 days (i.e., 12 months) beforehand were coded as having valid BMI data (N=687). Of 
these participants, 36.5% were obese (BMI of 30 or greater). 
Systolic blood pressure. SBP was recorded from chart data. Only participants who 
had their blood pressure recorded by their primary care physician a maximum of 365 days 
(i.e., 12 months) beforehand were coded as having valid SBP data (N = 944). Of these 
participants, 28.9% were hypertensive (i.e., had SBP of 141 or more for patients under 79 
years of age, or 151 or more for patients aged 80 or over; or diastolic blood pressure of 90 or 
more, or both). 
Drug prescriptions. The number of drug prescriptions made each participant by their 
GP in the last six months was recorded, including repeat prescriptions. Outliers were recoded 
so the maximum value on this measure was 10, resulting in a mean number of prescriptions 
of 3.29 (SD = 3.22).  
 Social isolation and frequent attendance    |    9 
Socioeconomic status. The location of each participants’ GP surgery was used as a 
proxy measure of socioeconomic status. Specifically, practices were categorized on the basis 
of postcode as lowest status (1), medium status (2) or high status (3).  
Study 1 Results 
Of the 1752 participants, 57.3% were female and 49.4% were in employment of some 
form. Descriptive statistics for all the focal variables are presented in Table 2.  
To assess the primary hypothesis (H1), a regression analysis was run with frequency 
of attendance as the dependent variable (see Table 3). The three key demographic variables 
(gender, age, and socioeconomic status) were entered at Step 1, and social group 
connectedness was entered at Step 2. Step 1 accounted for five per cent of variance in 
appointment frequency, with age (𝛽 = .22, p < .001) and socioeconomic status (𝛽 = -.10, p < 
.001) both significant predictors. At Step 2, social group connectedness was added (𝛽 = -.06, 
p = .009), which led to a significant increase in the percentage of variance explained by the 
model (Fchange (1, 1747) = 6.81, p = .009). This effect was such that a patient with no 
important group connections had attended their primary care provider an average of 4.69 
times in the past six months, compared to an average of 3.52 appointments among those 
patients with three important group connections.  
To assess H2a, the regression analysis for H1 was repeated adding the three indicators 
of physical health to Step 1: BMI, SBP and drug prescriptions. Only participants who had 
valid blood pressure and weight data from the past 12 months available were included in the 
analysis (N = 645). In this analysis, only number of drug prescriptions contributed 
significantly to the model at Step 1 (𝛽 = .52, p <.001), with the six covariates combined 
explaining 24 per cent of the variance in appointment frequency. Step 2 of the model added 
social group connections (𝛽 = -.08, p =.021), which led to a significant increase in the 
percentage of variance explained by the model, Fchange(1, 637) = 5.37, p = .021. Therefore, 
 Social isolation and frequent attendance    |    10 
social group connectedness was associated with reduced appointment frequency over and 
above three key indicators of chronic disease: BMI, SBP and drug prescriptions.   
Finally, to test H2b, a mediation model was run (N = 645; PROCESS model 4; 40). 
This model tested whether the effect of social group connectedness on frequency of 
attendance could be fully explained via its effect on physical health status. Social group 
connectedness was included as the independent variable, with number of drug prescriptions, 
BMI and SBP included as the mediators and appointment frequency as the dependent 
variable. In each mediation model, all variables have been standardised to provide beta 
coefficients. The same covariates of gender, age and socioeconomic status were also 
included. This analysis revealed no significant effect of social group connectedness on BMI 
(𝛽 = .02, CI: -.06, .10, p = .677), SBP (𝛽 = -.03, CI: -.10, .05, p = .487), or number of drug 
prescriptions (𝛽 = -.02,CI: -.09, .05, p = .622). In keeping with this, the indirect effects of 
social group connectedness on frequent attendance via BMI (𝛽 = .00, CI: -.01, .01), SBP (𝛽 = 
.00, CI: -.01, .01) and drug prescriptions (𝛽 = -.01, CI: -.07, .03) were also non-significant. 
There was, however, a significant direct effect of social group connectedness on frequent 
attendance in the final model (𝛽 = -.10, CI: -.19, -.02, p = .021). The direct effect of drug 
prescriptions was also significant (𝛽 = .62, CI: .53, .71, p < .001). Therefore, and consistent 
with H2b, the effect of social group connectedness on frequency of attendance was not 
attributable to its relationship with physical health status.  
Importantly, the tests of H1 and H2 were robust, yielding comparable results when 
alternative approaches to the regression models were tested. For instance, the results were 
substantively the same if: (a) covariates are not included in the analysis, (b) categorical 
indicators are used for obesity and hypertension, or (c) depression status, as measured using 
the Major Depression Inventory, is included as an additional covariate in Step 1.

Study 1 Discussion 
Study 1 found a significant relationship between social group connectedness and 
reduced frequency of primary care attendance after controlling for established predictors of 
frequent attendance such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status. This relationship 
remained significant after controlling for measures of physical health status taken by the 
primary care physician (specifically, BMI and SBP), as well as the number of drug 
prescriptions received in the last six months. The fact that the association remains significant 
even when accounting for the number of drug prescriptions a person has received is 
particularly surprising, given that receipt of most prescriptions requires an appointment with 
a physician. Furthermore, the effect of social group connectedness on attendance was not 
attributable to the protective effect of social group connectedness on health. In sum, Study 1 
established that lack of social group connectedness may warrant further investigation as a risk 
factor for frequent attendance in primary care.   
Study 1 had several strengths, including its large, diverse sample, and the availability 
of GP records for measures of attendance, prescriptions, BMI and SBP (rather than relying on 
patient report). Ideally, however, patient histories across several years might have been 
extracted, rather than only six months of data as was available for this study. Another 
drawback of Study 1 is that the response rate was relatively low, and so we cannot be 
confident that it is representative of the Scottish population of general practice attendees 
more generally. Based on previous research using similar recruitment strategies, we expect 
that our sample may underrepresent people who rarely attend primary care (only registered 
patients could be invited to participate) and overrepresent middle-aged, middle-class women 
(44). It is also the case that our sample is older and less healthy than a general population 
sample, but this is to be expected given that these characteristics are associated with 
attendance in general practice (45). Nevertheless, our participants were not at high risk of 
 Social isolation and frequent attendance    |    12 
frequent attendance, and the cross-sectional design of our study means that causality cannot 
be inferred. It is, however, worth noting that the reverse causal pathway, whereby frequent 
attendance in primary care leads to less social group connectedness, does not seem plausible. 
However, a third variable, such as poor mental health, might feasibly lead to both increased 
GP attendance and social isolation. Study 2 aims to address these weaknesses by 
investigating the hypothesized relationships longitudinally.  
Study 2 
Study 2 was a longitudinal study of a population going through a life transition that is known 
to compromise both social group connectedness and health: beginning university in a foreign 
country (46,47). Study 2 focused particularly on mental health status and its relationship with 
service use, as among young adults, poor psychological health is a much more common 
reason for frequent attendance in primary care than poor physical health (48). The sample 
comprised international students (N = 79) commencing university at a large Australian 
university, surveyed at the beginning and end of semester. This pre-post transition design was 
used as a natural experiment to assess whether decreased social group connectedness over 
time correspond to increased health service use (H3). We further assessed whether any 
increase in primary care attendance could be fully attributed to worsening health status, or 
whether there is a direct protective effect of social group connectedness on primary care 
attendance (H4).  
Study 2 Method 
Participants were from diverse backgrounds and reported 20 different countries of 
origin. The majority had a South-East Asian background (25% from Malaysia, 19% from 
Indonesia, 15% from Singapore). Two-thirds of the sample were female, with an average age 
of 22 years (SD = 3.97; range 17-37). Full descriptive statistics are presented in Table 2.  
 Social isolation and frequent attendance    |    13 
 
Participants were eligible if they were international students in their first semester of 
study at a large Australian university, and were recruited in the first three weeks of semester 
through university social media, advertisements at halls of residence and events for 
international students. Participants completed measures of social group connectedness, 
mental health and primary care attendance at Time 1 (T1; in the first three weeks of semester) 
and Time 2 (T2; in the last three weeks of semester; approximately four months later).   
Measures.  
Social group connectedness. Unlike Study 1, participants were not prompted with 
specific social groups, but were instead asked to generate up to six groups to which they felt 
psychologically connected (following 49; see also 43). Participants were given the following 
definition of what constitutes a social group:  
Please think about all the groups that you belong to. These groups can take any form, for example, 
they could be broad opinion-based or demographic groups (e.g., feminist; Australian); leisure or social 
groups (e.g., book group or gardening group); community groups (e.g., church group); sporting groups 
(e.g., rugby or tennis club); work groups (e.g., sales team); professional groups (e.g., trade union); or 
any others you can think of.”   
After writing the names of up to six groups, participants were then asked to rate the 
importance of each group to them on a scale from 1 “Not at all important” to 7 “Extremely 
important”. As in previous research, the number of groups that received an importance rating 
of 5 or higher were summed to provide an index of social group connectedness (37, 43).  
Primary care attendance. Participants were asked how many times they had visited 
their General Practitioner in the last month. This time period was chosen because the 
participants in Study 2 had moved countries a varying amount of time prior to commencing 
university, and we aimed to keep access to primary care in the new country comparable 
across participants and across time periods. Therefore, we chose a short time period for 
 Social isolation and frequent attendance    |    14 
retrospective recall of frequency of attendance so that, for the majority of participants, the 
recall window would be entirely post-relocation at both time points (1, 50).       
Mental ill-health. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales – 21 item short-form (DASS; 
40) total score was used as a global indicator of mental ill-health. This self-report measure 
includes questions about depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (e.g., “I find it hard to 
wind down”). The DASS has been found to be reliable and valid in both clinical and non-
clinical samples (51, 52). Reliability in the current study was also high (αT1= .92; αT2= .95). 
Study 2 analyses yield virtually identical results if the DASS depression and DASS anxiety 
subscales are used as our indicators of mental health, entered into the models either 
separately or together. Therefore, we used the DASS total score, both because we had no 
hypothesis regarding whether one presentation was more relevant to frequent attendance than 
the other, and to preserve power by reducing our number of variables in the analyses. 
Study 2 Results 
Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 2. A significant increase in frequency of 
attendance and mental ill-health was apparent over time, along with a significant decrease in 
social group connectedness.  
H3 was tested in a regression model predicting frequency of primary care attendance 
at T2, see Table 4. Step 1 included T1 frequency of primary care attendance and T1 social 
group connectedness.  Step 2 added T2 social group connectedness, in order to model how 
change in a person’s degree of connectedness over a four-month period affected frequency of 
attendance.  
Step 1 accounted for five percent of the variance in primary care attendance, with 
frequency of attendance at T1 the only significant predictor (𝛽 = .25, p = .030). The addition 
of T2 social group connectedness (𝛽 = -.26, p = .024) led to a significant increase in the 
percentage of variance explained by the model (Fchange (1, 75) = 5.29, p = .024). Consistent 
 Social isolation and frequent attendance    |    15 
with H3, this effect was such that the odds of being a frequent attender (more than one 
appointment in the last month) was six times higher for those who had 0 important groups 
compared to those who had three or more important groups.  
A follow-up analysis to test H4a expanded the regression model adding T1 mental ill-
health (at Step 1) and T2 mental ill-health (at Step 2) to the model. Unexpectedly, neither 
mental ill-health at T1 (𝛽 = .04, p = .759) or T2 (𝛽 = -.08, p = .557) significantly predicted 
primary care attendance after accounting for baseline frequency of attendance. However, T2 
social group connectedness remained a significant predictor, (𝛽 = -.29, p = .023). 
To assess H4b, a mediation model (PROCESS model 4; 40) was run with T2 social 
group connectedness as the independent variable, mental ill-health at T2 as the mediator, and 
T2 appointment frequency as the dependent variable. T1 measures of all three variables were 
included as covariates, and hence this model is best interpreted as testing how change in 
social group connectedness leads to change in primary care use (via change in mental ill-
health). This analysis revealed a significant effect of social group connectedness on mental 
ill-health (𝛽 = -.26, CI: -.46, -.06, p = .012). There was also a significant direct effect of 
social group connectedness on frequency of attendance, 𝛽 = -.29, CI: -.53, -.04, p = .023. 
However, there was no significant effect of mental ill-health on attendance (𝛽 = -.08, CI: -
.36, .19, p = .557), and therefore the indirect effect of social group connectedness on 
frequency of attendance was also non-significant (𝛽 = .02, CI: -.03, .14). Therefore, and 
consistent with H4b, the effect of social group connectedness on frequency of attendance was 
not attributable to its relationship with mental health status.  
Study 2 Discussion 
Study 2 found a significant increase over time in frequency of primary care 
attendance among this sample of students transitioning to university in a foreign country. 
Consistent with H3, the increase was predicted by a decline in social group connectedness 
 Social isolation and frequent attendance    |    16 
over the same time period. In line with H4, the link between low social group connectedness 
and frequent attendance was not attributable to a concurrent decline in mental health.    
A strength of Study 2 was its culturally diverse sample, which strengthens our 
confidence that the link between social group connectedness and primary care attendance are 
not limited to Western samples. Study 2 also allowed the investigation of this relationship 
among a population who were transitioning through a period of high risk, both for their 
health and their social group connections. Primary care physicians may be a particularly 
important point of contact for East Asian people experiencing mental illness, as research has 
indicated that this sample is more likely to experience and report physical symptoms (e.g., 
tiredness), rather than emotional symptoms (e.g., sadness, 53).  
A weakness of the study, however, was that the very life transition which placed 
participants at risk (moving to a new country and commencing university) may also have 
made it challenging to access primary care during the study period (which is why we asked 
about GP appointments only across the past month). The lack of relationship between mental 
health and frequency of attendance was also unexpected, and should be interpreted with 
caution given it is inconsistent with prior findings (although none exist with a comparable 
sample). Nevertheless, Study 2 supports previous research suggesting that transition to 
university is a high-risk period for mental health and high use of primary care, and indicates 
that a reduction in social group connectedness may be a shared determinant of these 
outcomes. This suggests that a fruitful avenue in reducing frequent attendance among 
vulnerable populations may be social or community interventions that aim to increase and 
maintain social group connectedness. Study 3 investigates this possibility. Additionally, 
Study 3 includes a measure of participants’ subjective evaluation of their health status, which, 
in capturing a person’s awareness of and responsivity to their symptoms, may be particularly 
likely to drive frequent attendance.

Study 3 
Study 3 was a small intervention pilot study (N = 46), which assessed whether joining 
a community recreational group can reduce primary care utilisation three months later. The 
sample was a disadvantaged population who were at high risk of complex health problems, 
and were mostly high users both of primary care as well as specialist and emergency health 
services.  
Three hypotheses were proposed. First, we hypothesized that joining a recreational 
group would lead to an overall reduction in primary care attendance at follow up (H5). 
Second, we hypothesised that the mechanism of this reduction would be an increase in social 
group connectedness over the same time period (H6). Third, we hypothesised that the 
relationship between increased social group connectedness and reduced frequency of 
attendance would not be fully accounted for by improved health status (H7). Study 3 focused 
on subjective wellbeing as an indicator of health, a variable which has been widely used in 
epidemiological research and has been found to be a reliable predictor of primary care 
consultations and longevity (54). 
Study 3 Method 
Participants were 46 disadvantaged community members (75% female, mostly not 
employed, M age 45) who were facilitated to join a recreational social group. Participants 
joined a social group that best matched their interests and circumstances (e.g., indoor soccer, 
sewing), from a variety of groups run by a non-government organization (Reclink). Groups 
were run weekly in a disadvantaged regional area and mostly facilitated by social workers. 
Referral pathways to the groups included discharge from psychiatric hospital, domestic 
violence services, drug and alcohol services, and housing services. Therefore, participants’ 
healthcare needs were typically high and complex. Importantly, participants’ use of 
healthcare services was not discussed or discouraged in the social groups, which focused 
 Social isolation and frequent attendance    |    18 
entirely on social connection and recreational activity. Participants were surveyed when they 
commenced attending the group (at the first session; T1) and three months later (T2).  
Measures 
Primary care attendance. Participants responded to a self-report question which asked 
how often they had visited their general practitioner over the past three months. This time 
period was chosen because it corresponds to the time delay between T1 and T2. Study 3 
participants had more than double the average number of primary care visits found in Study 1 
or 2, with an average of 3.74 visits in the last three months at T1 (range 0-15).  
Social group connectedness. As in Study 2, the group listing task was used. Social 
group connectedness was operationalised as the sum of the number of important groups (i.e., 
groups rated 5, 6 or 7 out of 7) from 0 to 6.  
Subjective wellbeing. In Study 3, subjective health status was measured using the 
following two items (referencing the social recreational intervention activity): “Since joining 
this activity, has your physical health and fitness…” and “Since joining this activity, has your 
mental health and wellbeing…” Both questions had three response options: “Gotten worse” 
(0), “Stayed the same” (1), or “Improved” (2). Responses to these two items were summed to 
form a 0-4 scale in which higher scores indicated a greater degree of improvement in 
subjective wellbeing. Study 3 analyses yield virtually identical results if the two individual 
items are used as separate indicators of subjective wellbeing, entered into the models either 
separately or together. Therefore, we used the sum score, both because we conceptualized 
subjective wellbeing as encompassing both physical and mental wellbeing, and to preserve 
power by reducing our number of variables in the analyses. 
Study 3 Results 
A paired samples t-test was conducted to assess H5. Results indicated that primary 
care attendance reduced significantly following social intervention, t(45) 3.28, p = .002. 
 Social isolation and frequent attendance    |    19 
Overall, 41.3% of participants experienced a reduction in the frequency of primary care 
attendance, which represents a Number Needed to Treat of 2.4 (i.e., the average number of 
people who would need to be exposed to this intervention in order for one person to 
experience a benefit). While we cannot confidently attribute this to the intervention in the 
absence of a control group, we can investigate whether there is evidence for our theorized 
mechanism. Specifically, does an increase in important group memberships predict the 
reduction in GP attendance? Confirming H6, this is exactly what we found.  
A regression analysis was run to predict frequency of attendance at T2, see Table 5. 
Step 1 included T1 frequency of attendance and T1 social group connectedness. Only 
frequency of attendance at T1 was an independent significant predictor (𝛽 = .71, p < .001).  
Step 2 added T2 social group connectedness (𝛽 = -. 36, p = .042), which in accordance with 
H6, led to a significant increase in the percentage of variance explained by the model, Fchange 
(1, 42) = 4.39, p = .042. This effect was such that a participant who gained one 
(psychological) group membership (25% of the sample) after commencing the social 
intervention was likely to have one fewer primary care appointment over the intervening 
three months than a participant who lost one group membership over the same period (11.4% 
of the sample).  
To explore the robustness of this finding in line with H7a, the regression model used 
to assess H6 was repeated with subjective welbeing included as a covariate (at Step 1). 
Eighty percent of participants reported some degree of improvement in their subjective 
wellbeing. Social group connectedness at T2 remained a significant predictor of frequency of 
attendance at T2, (𝛽= -.36, p = .012).  
Finally, to assess H7b, a mediation model (PROCESS model 4; 40) was run with T2 
social group connectedness as the independent variable, subjective wellbeing as the mediator, 
and T2 appointment frequency as the dependent variable. T1 measures of social group 
 Social isolation and frequent attendance    |    20 
connectedness and appointment frequency were included as covariates, and hence the results 
are best interpreted as modelling how change in social group connectedness (following the 
social intervention) affects subjective wellbeing and primary care use. This analysis revealed 
a significant direct effect of social group connectedness on frequency of attendance, 𝛽 = -.36, 
CI: -.63, -.08, p = .012. There was a marginally significant effect of social group 
connectedness on subjective wellbeing (𝛽 =. 35, CI: -.03, .73, p = .067), as well as a 
marginally significant effect of subjective wellbeing on attendance (𝛽 = .21, CI: -.01, .43, p = 
.059). The indirect effect of social group connectedness on frequency of attendance (via 
subjective wellbeing) was significant (𝛽 = .07, CI:-.001, .25). Therefore, the effect of social 
group connectedness on frequency of attendance acted partially (though not entirely) through 
it effect on subjective wellbeing. 
Study 3 Discussion 
Study 3 found that vulnerable members of the community who join a recreational 
group experience a significant reduction in their frequency of primary care attendance three 
months later. Those participants who subjectively experienced a gain in their social group 
connectedness were most likely to exhibit this reduction in attendance. Furthermore, 
participants did experience a gain in their subjective wellbeing over the same time period, 
and the relationship between social group connectedness and frequency of attendance was 
partially attributable to their subjectively improved health status.  
A strength of Study 3 was its longitudinal design in a vulnerable population, with the 
intervention conducted in a realistic community setting. This increases the likelihood that a 
social intervention such as this would be affordable and feasible in practice. However, 
weaknesses of Study 3 were its small sample and the fact it was not a controlled trial. The 
subjective wellbeing measure also relied on retrospective recall. Study 3 therefore provides 
only preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of this particular intervention for frequent 
 Social isolation and frequent attendance    |    21 
attendance. Nevertheless, this study speaks to the promise of interventions for frequent 
attendance that target the unmet social needs of patients, rather than purely educational or 
mental health-focused interventions such as those previously trialled.  
General Discussion 
Across three studies, we found that social group connectedness was associated with 
reduced primary care attendance. This was found among a large and diverse sample in 
Scotland recruited from primary care registers (Study 1), among a sample of students 
transitioning to university in a foreign country (Study 2); and among a vulnerable population 
with complex health needs who joined a community recreational group (Study 3). 
Furthermore, each study also found that the link between social group connectedness and 
frequent attendance could not be explained by the fact that those with lower social group 
connectedness had poorer health in general. In other words, while positive changes in social 
group connectedness did predict better health in Studies 2 and 3, this was not the only reason 
why people with more social group connectedness attended their primary care physician less 
often. Instead, to understand the link between social group connectedness and frequent 
attendance, we need to consider the psychological needs that frequent attending might meet.  
Specifically, the evidence presented here suggests that frequent attendance is not 
solely the result of one’s poor physical or mental health status. This is consistent with the 
literature indicating that interventions targeting psychoeducation or mental health have been 
ineffective in reducing the number of primary care consultations. Instead, frequent attenders 
are more likely to be isolated from meaningful social groups, from which they can derive 
emotional support (55) and contribute meaningfully to their community (56). This alienation 
from typical sources of social connection may increase the likelihood that, in times of stress 
(whether related to compromised health or not), a person will draw upon the support of their 
primary care physician. This constitutes ‘inappropriate’ use of healthcare resources, in the 
 Social isolation and frequent attendance    |    22 
sense that providing such support does not require the specialist medical training of a primary 
care physician. However, the psychological need for social connection is fundamental (57), 
and thus it is not surprising that people may seek to meet this need in any manner that is 
available to them.  
It is therefore of particular significance that in Study 3, we were able to demonstrate 
that by meeting the social needs of patients through other means (i.e., recreational groups 
facilitated by a community organisation), the frequency of primary care attendance could be 
reduced. We consider this a very promising avenue for future research, given the cost-
effective nature of such (social) interventions. These findings are also consistent with other 
evidence that disadvantaged adults experience health and wellbeing benefits from arts-based 
groups (e.g., 58). Clinical interventions that target social isolation, or assist patients to meet 
their social needs (e.g., 59) may also be appropriate for frequent attenders. Of course, this is 
not to suggest that social interventions should or could replace appropriate healthcare, but 
rather that when social needs are met, one factor leading to frequent attendance is removed. 
The main implication of this research for clinical practice is that physicians who seek to 
better meet the needs of frequent attenders may find benefit in attending to the social worlds 
of their patients – and discussing appropriate means through which unmet needs could be 
addressed.    
The studies presented here have several strengths, particularly in the diversity of their 
samples: Study 1 was a large and broad survey of primary care patients in Scotland, Study 2 
was a culturally diverse sample of young adults surveyed at the beginning and end of a major 
life transition, and Study 3 examined the effect of a social intervention for a sample of 
vulnerable members who were at risk due to social disadvantage and complex health issues. 
Furthermore, each study conceptualised and measured health status in a different way 
(objectively measured physical health indicators in Study 1, mental health in Study 2, 
 Social isolation and frequent attendance    |    23 
subjective wellbeing in Study 3). However, while these studies were able to establish the 
relationship between social group connectedness and frequent attendance and rule out some 
alternative explanations, a strong causal argument would require experimental evidence. For 
instance, a next step for future research might be to conduct a randomised controlled trial of a 
social intervention among a sample of frequent attenders.   
Conclusions 
In sum, this research has demonstrated frequent primary care attendance is not a 
simple function of poor health or somatization, as has been suggested by the literature to date. 
Instead, frequent attendance is probably motivated by social needs, as well as by health 
needs. While the pain and distress of feeling alienated may not be a medical issue, it is 
nevertheless a significant problem which compromises quality of life, and one that might be 
addressed through social intervention. Furthermore, such social intervention may be a better 
fit for the healthcare needs of frequent attenders, with consequent benefits for mental and 
subjective physical health. This is an important finding for primary care physicians in 
particular, as they are often one of the few available points of social connection among 
isolated people. To the extent that group-based social connection can be supported through 
other means, this may have benefits not just for a person’s health, but also for the effective 
and cost-effective functioning of the healthcare system.
