Focal brain injury can sometimes lead to bizarre symptoms, such as the delusion that a family member has been replaced by an
imposter (Capgras syndrome). How a single brain lesion could cause such a complex disorder is unclear, leading many to speculate
that concurrent delirium, psychiatric disease, dementia, or a second lesion is required. Here we instead propose that Capgras and
other delusional misidentification syndromes arise from single lesions at unique locations within the human brain connectome. This
hypothesis is motivated by evidence that symptoms emerge from sites functionally connected to a lesion location, not just the lesion
location itself. First, 17 cases of lesion-induced delusional misidentifications were identified and lesion locations were mapped to a
common brain atlas. Second, lesion network mapping was used to identify brain regions functionally connected to the lesion
locations. Third, regions involved in familiarity perception and belief evaluation, two processes thought to be abnormal in delu-
sional misidentifications, were identified using meta-analyses of previous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. We found
that all 17 lesion locations were functionally connected to the left retrosplenial cortex, the region most activated in functional
magnetic resonance imaging studies of familiarity. Similarly, 16 of 17 lesion locations were functionally connected to the right
frontal cortex, the region most activated in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of expectation violation, a component of
belief evaluation. This connectivity pattern was highly specific for delusional misidentifications compared to four other lesion-
induced neurological syndromes (P 5 0.0001). Finally, 15 lesions causing other types of delusions were connected to expectation
violation (P 5 0.0001) but not familiarity regions, demonstrating specificity for delusion content. Our results provide potential
neuroanatomical correlates for impaired familiarity perception and belief evaluation in patients with delusional misidentifications.
More generally, we demonstrate a mechanism by which a single lesion can cause a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome based on
that lesion’s unique pattern of functional connectivity, without the need for pre-existing or hidden pathology.

 Introduction
Delusional misidentification syndromes are among the most
striking and least understood syndromes encountered in
neurology and psychiatry (for an example of a patient’s
description, see Supplementary Video 1). In Capgras syn-
drome, a patient is able to identify and recognize a familiar
person, such as a spouse or parent, but experiences that
person as unfamiliar, leading to the bizarre conclusion that
their family member has been replaced by an imposter
(Capgras and Reboul-Lachaux, 1923). In Fregoli syndrome,
a stranger is believed to be a familiar person in disguise
(Courbon and Fail, 1927). Similar delusional misidentifica-
tions
can
occur
for
non-human
animals
(Darby
and
Caplan, 2016) and personally relevant locations and build-
ings, such as one’s home (Pick, 1903).
Many theories have attempted to explain how the abnor-
mal belief in Capgras syndrome in particular emerges. In
his original report, Capgras proposed that dysfunction of
brain regions involved in the experience of familiarity must
be required (Capgras and Reboul-Lachaux, 1923). It re-
mains unclear which brain regions are involved in this ab-
normal sense of familiarity, although dysfunction of the
dorsal visual pathway (Ellis and Young, 1990) and discon-
nection between the fusiform face area and amygdala
(Hirstein
and
Ramachandran,
1997;
Ramachandran,
1998) have been proposed. In addition to impaired famil-
iarity perception, other theories have proposed deficits in
theory
of mind (Hirstein,
2010),
personal
relatedness
(Feinberg, 2011), or autobiographical memory (Staton
et al., 1982; Darby and Caplan, 2016).
In each of these explanations, it is assumed that there is
an additional functional deficit that allows the abnormal
perception to go unchallenged, leading to the development
of a delusional belief. According to one model, all delusions
are conceptualized as a ‘two-hit’ process, with (i) an abnor-
mal perception leading to the specific bizarre content for a
given delusion; and (ii) impaired belief evaluation, which
allows the abnormal delusional belief to form (Coltheart,
2007, 2010). Other models propose that belief and percep-
tion are integrated into a single process, such as prediction
error (Corlett et al., 2010), or that belief evaluation and
perception interact in a bidirectional manner (Young,
2008). While each theory proposes abnormal familiarity
perception and belief evaluation, a neurobiological explan-
ation for how this might occur in patients with delusional
misidentifications is lacking.
Patients with focal brain lesions offer the opportunity to
test these theories by linking damage to specific neuroana-
tomical
locations
with
delusional
misidentifications
(Feinberg,
2005;
Devinsky,
2009;
Darby
and
Prasad,
2016). However, this approach has been difficult for
three reasons. First, lesions causing delusional misidentifi-
cations are rare and have been reported across different
brain areas (Darby and Prasad, 2016), making localization
to a single region difficult. Second, the most common
location for these lesions is the right frontal lobe (Darby
and Prasad, 2016), an area without a clear role in process-
ing familiarity (Gobbini and Haxby, 2007). Third, and per-
haps most challenging, it is difficult to explain how a single
brain lesion could disrupt multiple different network func-
tions as required by the ‘two hit’ and other theories
(Coltheart, 2007, 2010). Due in part to these difficulties,
it has been suggested that only patients with pre-existing
psychiatric disease (Devine et al., 2014), dementia (Levine
and Grek, 1984; Rabins et al., 1991), hidden brain lesions
(Hirstein and Ramachandran, 1997), or other predisposing
factors (Ellis and Young, 1990) are susceptible to lesion-
induced delusional misidentifications.
Recently, we developed and validated a technique termed
lesion network mapping for investigating lesion-induced
neurological symptoms (Boes et al., 2015). This technique
enables one to test the hypothesis that symptoms emerge
from sites functionally connected to a lesion location, not
just the lesion location itself (Monakow, 1914). Here, we
apply this technique towards understanding lesion-induced
delusional misidentifications. We hypothesized that lesion
locations causing delusional misidentifications would be
connected to regions involved in familiarity processing
and belief evaluation.
Materials and methods
Patient cases from the literature
To identify patients with delusional misidentifications for per-
sons or places, we searched Pubmed for the terms related to
delusional misidentification syndromes (‘delusional misidentifi-
cation syndrome’, DMS, Capgras, Fregoli, ‘reduplicative par-
amnesia’, subjective doubles, intermetamorphosis, or Cotard)
and evidence of abnormal neuroimaging (MRI or CT) or
neurological injury (stroke, haemorrhage, trauma or lesion).
Patients were required to have a delusional belief involving
the sense of under-familiarity for a person (Capgras) or place
(reduplicative amnesia), or the feeling of over-familiarity for a
person (Fregoli) or place (reduplicative paramnesia). Inclusion
criteria included clinical data sufficient to determine the nature
of the delusion, an acute, localized neurological injury (ischae-
mic or haemorrhagic stroke), and imaging showing lesions
with enough clarity to trace onto a standard brain atlas.
Patients with pre-existing psychiatric or neurological disease
were excluded. Fifteen patients were identified using these cri-
teria (Supplementary Table 1).
Patient cases at the study centre
In addition, we included two cases of patients encountered in
our centre.
Patient 1
An 83-year-old female initially presented with sudden onset of
left-sided face, arm, and leg weakness and confusion. She was
found to have a large right frontal haemorrhage, which was
stable on serial imaging. Her weakness slowly improved,

 although she was noted to have difficulty in orientation to
place, believing she was in a different city while hospitalized,
and at times believing she was at her place of work while at a
rehabilitation hospital. Four months after her initial presenta-
tion she presented for follow-up to the neurology clinic where
she was noted to have the persistent delusion that her home
was not her ‘real’ home. She described recognizing individual
objects in her home, its spatial layout, and other features as
being identical with her actual home, but believed it was
nevertheless a different home located in a different location.
She would occasionally pack belongings, believing that she
would be returning to her ‘real’ house. She denied other delu-
sions, including misidentifications of persons or other objects.
She had documented impairment in short-term memory at her
initial presentation, but had normal cognitive and neurological
exam at the time of her follow-up appointment. At follow-up
an additional 4 months later, the delusion had resolved. See
Supplementary Video 1 for patient interview.
Patient 2
A 70-year-old female presented initially with confusion. A
more detailed history revealed that she had been at a friend’s
house when she began saying that the house did not ‘feel’ like
her friend’s real house, and must be a replica. Upon returning
to her own home she felt that this home was not her real
home, and must be in a different city despite looking identical.
Her delusion resolved by the next day. She was found to have
a right frontal ischaemic stroke on neuroimaging. She had mild
left-sided face, arm, and leg weakness, disorientation to date,
and short-term memory impairment on exam. Unfortunately,
she had progressive right internal cerebral artery territory
infarctions from a progressive vasculopathy due to varicella-
zoster virus, and died �1 month after presentation. She had no
further delusions documented during that time period.
Lesion localization
Published images or the patient’s own MRI were used to map
each lesion location to a common brain atlas (Fig. 1). Lesions
were
traced
by
hand
onto
a
standardized
brain
atlas
(2 � 2 � 2 MNI space) using FSL. All available images were
traced for each patient. In the case of our two personal, un-
published cases, each axial slice involving the lesion was traced
to approximate the 3D volume of the lesion.
Lesion network mapping
Our group recently developed a technique termed lesion net-
work mapping that identifies brain regions functionally con-
nected to lesion locations causing a given neuropsychiatric
symptom (Boes et al., 2015). This technique avoids the need
to perform functional brain imaging on the patients themselves
and has been validated across four different neurological syn-
dromes. Briefly, traced lesions were used as individual seeds in
a resting state connectivity analysis with data from 98 normal
subjects. The correlated time course between each lesion loca-
tion and every other brain voxel was calculated using the
resting state data from each individual normal control. These
correlations for all 98 subjects were then combined to calculate
a T-score value for every individual voxel. Both positive and
negative correlations with the time course of the lesion loca-
tion were included. Voxels were thresholded at T 4 �4.25
Figure 1 Lesions causing delusional misidentifications. Each lesion, numbered 1 through 17, was identified from a literature search or
from cases seen by the authors and manually traced onto a common brain atlas (MNI).

 (P 5 0.00005 for 98 degrees of freedom, uncorrected for mul-
tiple comparisons) in order to create a binarized map of sig-
nificantly functionally connected regions to each patient’s
lesion site. Finally, maps from each of the patients were com-
bined to form the lesion network mapping overlap for the
group, showing the number of patients with lesions function-
ally connected with each individual voxel (Fig. 2).
Familiarity ALE meta-analysis
We searched Pubmed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/)
for the terms ‘personal or personally’, familiar, and functional
MRI, including studies where personally familiar stimuli (faces,
names, voices, places, objects) were compared with unfamiliar
stimuli. We included stimuli of different categories (persons,
places, objects) and sensory modalities (visual, auditory) be-
cause delusional misidentifications have been reported in
each of these domains. The coordinates of all significant foci
from each study were included. If coordinates were reported in
Talaraich space, they were first converted to MNI space using
the algorithm available on GingerALE.
The activation likelihood estimate of all foci was calculated
using GingerALE v2.3.3 (www.brainmap.org). First, a 3D
Gaussian probability distribution is created centred on each
individual foci and modified by the sample size from each
study in order to estimate the spatial uncertainty surrounding
each focus. These distributions are then combined across all
experiments to arrive at the activation likelihood estimate
maps. Finally, a cluster-level inference is used to determine
significance. The true convergence on the ALE is compared
against a null distribution of 1000 simulated datasets with
identical number of foci, experiments, and subjects, but with
the foci randomly distributed. Cluster-forming threshold was
set at P 5 0.001 and cluster-level inference threshold was set at
P 5 0.05.
Belief evaluation ALE meta-analyses
The process of detecting and challenging delusional thought
content is difficult to define and test in normal subjects experi-
mentally. Here, we define belief evaluation as the process of
detecting and evaluating events that violate one’s expectation,
sometimes also referred to as prediction error (Corlett et al.,
2010). While belief evaluation is sometimes included as a type
of ‘reality monitoring’, reality monitoring has also been used
to refer to source monitoring of memory retrieval related to
internally versus externally generated stimuli (Mitchell and
Johnson, 2009; Metzak et al., 2015). Therefore, we use the
term ‘belief evaluation’ to avoid ambiguity with this second
meaning of reality monitoring.
The most straightforward and widely studied task for ex-
pectation violation is the detection of invalid cues, a standard
component of the Posner invalid cue paradigm (Posner, 1980).
Though certainly not identical to belief evaluation, detecting
events that violate expectation may be part of detecting and
challenging delusions (Corlett et al., 2010). We searched

 Pubmed for the terms (invalidity or ‘violation of expectation’)
and functional MRI, as well as relevant references from review
articles. We included studies that used variations of the Posner
invalid cue paradigm. This paradigm involves identifying the
spatial location of target stimuli after explicitly being in-
structed that the stimuli will occur in a particular location.
Inclusion in our meta-analysis required reporting significant
coordinates from regions contrasting unexpected trials (where
the stimuli occurred in the opposite location) with expected
trials, with selection of the appropriate stimuli using a vol-
itional motor response.
To ensure that results were not dependent on the details of
this meta-analysis, we confirmed our findings using two other
meta-analyses of expectation violation. First, we obtained
the results of an independent, recently published ALE meta-
analysis of auditory and visual ‘oddball’ tasks (Kim, 2014).
These tasks also include violations of expectation, where an
unexpected image or tone is placed within a sequence of ex-
pected images or tones.
Second, we performed a meta-analysis of two types of func-
tional imaging studies involving expectation violation of cog-
nitive beliefs. First, we included studies where expectations of
a previously learned association are violated, leading to pre-
diction error (Corlett et al., 2004). For example, a subject
learns that a certain food is associated with an allergic reac-
tion. After learning this association, on some trials the food
will not be associated with an allergic reaction, violating the
expectation based on this previously learned belief (Corlett
et al., 2004). Second, we included studies of logical syllogisms
where a logical conclusion violates the expectation based on a
previously held belief. For example, the argument: ‘No addict-
ive things are inexpensive. Some cigarettes are inexpensive.
Therefore
some
cigarettes
are
not
addictive’
(Goel
and
Dolan, 2003) is logically valid, but the conclusion violates a
subject’s prior beliefs that cigarettes are addictive. In contrast
to the initial meta-analyses, which assessed lower-level expect-
ation violation (e.g. an invalid cue or odd-ball), this additional
meta-analysis included studies of prediction error and logical
syllogism tasks that assess for more complex violations of ex-
pectation related to beliefs.
Connectivity between lesions and
meta-analysis regions
Next we determined whether lesion locations causing delu-
sional misidentifications showed greater connectivity to regions
involved in familiarity perception or expectation violation (as
identified in our ALE meta-analyses) than lesion locations
causing other neurological syndromes. For this analysis, func-
tional MRI time courses were extracted from each lesion loca-
tion and each ALE-derived region of interest. The Pearson’s
correlation coefficient between time courses was computed for
each subject in our normative 98-subject dataset. Resulting r-
values were converted to a normal distribution using Fischer’s
r to z transform and statistically compared using a two-tailed
t-test. Lesion locations causing delusional misidentifications
were compared to lesion locations causing four other neuro-
logical syndromes (n = 77) from our previously published work
(Boes et al., 2015). These syndromes included auditory hallu-
cinations,
visual
hallucinations,
post-stroke
pain,
and
subcortical aphasia. All statistics were computed using the stat-
istical package STATA (College Station, TX, version 14.0).
Lesions causing other delusions
As a final, more stringent test of specificity, lesion locations
causing delusional misidentifications were compared to lesion
locations causing delusions with different content (e.g. perse-
cution). We identified an additional 15 lesions from the litera-
ture
that
resulted
in
delusions
other
than
delusional
misidentifications (Kumral and Oztu
¨rk, 2004). The above
lesion network mapping and time course analyses were re-
peated using this separate cohort of delusion lesions and re-
sults were statistically compared to lesions causing delusional
misidentifications and the four other neurological syndromes.
Results
Lesion identification and network
mapping
We identified 17 lesions resulting in delusional misidentifi-
cation (Fig. 1).
Lesion network mapping was used to identify brain re-
gions functionally connected to the greatest number of
lesion locations (Fig. 2). The left retrosplenial cortex was
the only site in the brain functionally connected with all 17
lesion locations (negative correlation, Fig. 3A). Sixteen of
17 lesions were also functionally connected (positively cor-
related) with a region in the right ventral frontal cortex/
anterior insula (Fig. 4A). Other sites of shared connectivity
were apparent at a slightly lower threshold (Supplementary
Table 2).
Familiarity meta-analysis
We identified 15 neuroimaging studies that compared per-
sonally familiar stimuli to unfamiliar stimuli in normal sub-
jects (Supplementary Table 3). The left retrosplenial cortex
was the region most activated by personally familiar stimuli
(Fig. 3B), and all 17 lesions causing delusional misidentifi-
cations
were
functionally
connected
to
this
location
(Fig. 3C). Other regions from our lesion network mapping
also matched activation sites from the familiarity meta-ana-
lysis (Supplementary Table 4).
Violation of expectation
meta-analysis
We found 11 neuroimaging studies that compared the de-
tection of unexpected versus expected stimuli using vari-
ations of the Posner paradigm (Supplementary Table 5).
The right ventral frontal cortex was the region most acti-
vated by trials involving unexpected or invalid cues (Fig. 4B
and Supplementary Table 6), and 14 of 17 lesions causing
delusional misidentifications were significantly functionally
connected to this region (Fig. 4C). Right frontal regions

 were also activated by expectation violation in ‘oddball’
tasks (Supplementary Fig. 1A; Kim, 2014) and expectation
violation of cognitive beliefs (Supplementary Fig. 1B and
Supplementary Tables 7 and 8).
Connectivity between lesions and
meta-analysis regions
Although there was overlap between our lesion network
and meta-analysis maps, a more direct test of our hypoth-
esis is to perform a region of interest functional connectiv-
ity analysis. Specifically, lesion locations causing delusional
misidentifications (Fig. 1) and voxels identified in our meta-
analyses (e.g. Figs 3B and 4B) were used as regions of
interest and functional connectivity between regions was
computed. Lesion locations causing delusional misidentifi-
cations were significantly negatively correlated with regions
involved in familiarity detection (mean correlation = �0.23,
P 5 0.0001, Fig. 5A) and significantly positively correlated
with regions activated by violation of expectation (mean
correlation = 0.24, P 5 0.0005, Fig. 5B). Results were simi-
lar using regions activated by expectation violation in the
oddball
task
(mean
correlation = 0.34,
P 5 0.0001,
Supplementary Fig. 2B) or expectation violation of beliefs
(mean correlation = 0.16, P 5 0.005, Supplementary Fig.
2C). For all analyses, results were specific to lesions causing

functional
connectivity
to
meta-analysis regions was significantly stronger for lesions
causing delusional misidentifications compared to lesions
causing other neurological syndromes (P 5 0.0001 for all
comparisons).
Comparison to lesions causing other
delusions
We next tested the hypothesis that connectivity of lesions to
expectation violation areas is related to delusion formation
more generally, while connectivity to familiarity perception
areas is specific to delusional misidentifications. We identi-
fied an additional 15 lesions from the literature that
resulted in delusions other than delusional misidentifica-
tions (Kumral and Oztu
¨rk, 2004). Lesion network mapping
identified overlap in the right frontal cortex similar to our
initial cohort, but no overlap in the retrosplenial cortex
(Supplementary
Fig.
3
and
Supplementary
Table
9).
Delusion lesion locations were not connected to familiarity
regions (mean correlation = �0.007, P = 0.89, Fig. 6A) but
were connected to regions involved in expectation violation
using invalid cues (mean correlation = 0.13, P 5 0.01, Fig.
6B), oddball tasks (mean correlation = 0.18, P 5 0.05,
Supplementary Fig. 4B), and belief tasks (mean correl-
ation = 0.12,
P 5 0.005,

pectation violation based on invalid cues (P = 0.11, not
significant), oddball tasks (P = 0.09, not significant), or
belief tasks (P = 0.46, not significant).
Discussion
Our results demonstrate that lesions causing delusional mis-
identifications are characterized by a unique pattern of
functional brain connectivity to both regions involved in
perceiving familiarity and regions involved in expectation
violation.
This
pattern
of
connectivity
was
specific

tection and violation of expectation. The temporal correlation in spontaneous functional MRI activity between lesion locations and regions
identified in our familiarity meta-analyses (A) or violation of expectation meta-analysis (B) were computed using a cohort of healthy subjects.
Correlations were averaged across our 17 lesion locations causing delusional misidentifications (blue) and compared to 77 lesions causing other
neurological syndromes (control syndromes, red). *P 5 0.0005. ** P 5 0.0001.

ing other types of delusions were not connected to famil-

content), but were connected to expectation violation re-
gions. Taken together, our results provide a neuro-anatom-

for

Neuroanatomical localization of
familiarity
The retrosplenial cortex was functionally connected to all
17 lesion locations causing delusional misidentifications,
was not connected to lesion locations causing other delu-
sions (or other neurological syndromes), and was the brain
area most associated with familiarity perception in our ima-
ging meta-analysis. Prior theories have attributed the ab-
normal belief content in delusional misidentifications to
deficits in determining the personal relatedness of objects
(Feinberg, 2011), theory of mind (Hirstein, 2010), and re-
trieval of relevant autobiographical memories (Staton et al.,
1982; Darby and Caplan, 2016). All these functions fit
proposed
functions
of
the
retrosplenial
cortex
(Vann
et al., 2009). Our results fail to support the specific neuro-
anatomical localization proposed by prior models (Ellis and
Young,
1990;
Hirstein
and
Ramachandran,
1997;
Ramachandran, 1998), but do support these model’s hy-
pothesis implicating regions involved in processing familiar-
ity
rather
than
those
involved
in
facial
and
object
recognition.
Ideally, our study would have included a group of con-
trol lesions that disrupt familiarity perception without caus-
ing delusions, similar to our group of control lesions
causing delusions without disrupting familiarity. However,
it’s unclear that such a control group exists. Patients with
ventromedial prefrontal cortex lesions have abnormal gal-
vanic skin responses (GSR) to familiar faces (Tranel et al.,
1995; Tranel, 2000) similar to patients with Capgras syn-
drome (Ellis et al., 1997; Hirstein and Ramachandran,
1997; Brighetti et al., 2007), and do not have delusions,
making them a potential control group (Coltheart, 2007,
2010). However, individual lesion locations for these pa-
tients were not provided in previous publications. More
importantly, these patients do not lose their experience of
familiarity (Tranel et al., 1995; Young, 2009) and have
abnormal GSR in tasks unrelated to familiarity (Bechara
et al., 1994, 1997; Moretto et al., 2010), making it unlikely
that they share the same perceptual deficit as patients with
delusional misidentifications.
Neuroanatomical localization of
belief evaluation
The right frontal cortex was functionally connected to
almost all lesion locations causing delusions regardless of
the specific delusion content, was not connected to lesion
locations causing other neurological syndromes, and was
activated in all three of our expectation violation meta-ana-
lyses. The right ventral frontal cortex has been implicated
in reorienting attention (Corbetta et al., 2008) and context-
ual updating of one’s internal representation of the external
world (Geng and Vossel, 2013). The right dorsal frontal
cortex has been implicated in belief evaluation and predic-
tion error (Corlett et al., 2004). Both regions are more
connected to lesions causing delusions than lesions causing
other neurological syndromes in our study. As such, these
regions may play a role in lesion-induced delusion forma-
tion consistent with prior hypotheses (Coltheart, 2010;
Corlett et al., 2010).
Implications for theoretic models of
delusional misidentification
syndromes
Our results support the two-factor model of delusions
(Coltheart, 2007, 2010) by showing that (i) lesions causing
delusional misidentifications are functionally connected to
both familiarity and belief evaluation regions; and (ii) con-
nectivity to familiarity regions was specific to delusional
misidentifications and not other delusions. Our results
also support the prediction error model (Corlett et al.,
2010; Corlett and Fletcher, 2015) by showing that lesions
are connected to right frontal regions involved in expect-
ation violation. Finally, our results could be consistent with
the interactionist model (Young, 2008) as lesion connectiv-
ity to both familiarity regions and expectation violation
regions may disrupt integration between these processes.
Our results may also contradict aspects of prior theories.
For example, it is unclear how connectivity to familiarity
regions in the retrosplenial cortex fits with prediction-error
models (Corlett et al., 2010; Corlett and Fletcher, 2015).
Similarly, two-factor theories often propose distinct mech-
anisms for different delusional misidentifications (Hirstein
and
Ramachandran,
1997;
Ramachandran,
1998;
Coltheart, 2007, 2010). However, we found a similar pat-
tern of connectivity across cases of hyper and hypo famil-
iarity and as well as misidentifications involving different
categories of objects (e.g. people versus places). This com-
monality may explain why different types of delusional
misidentifications
can
co-occur
in
the
same
patient
(Paille
`re-Martinot et al., 1994; Darby and Prasad, 2016).
Determining whether connectivity differences exist between
different types of delusional misidentifications will require a
larger cohort of patients with non-overlapping symptoms.
Lesion network mapping
It is important to note that lesion network mapping does not
involve obtaining functional neuroimaging from actual pa-
tients. Rather, functional connectivity from healthy normal
subjects is used to determine regions normally connected to
lesion locations. This approach has some advantages over

 direct measurement of connectivity in actual patients (Boes
et al., 2015). First, this technique can be applied in rare
syndromes such as lesion-induced delusional misidentifica-
tions, where imaging a patient cohort would be logistically
difficult. Second, with patient data we would be unable to
assess functional connectivity with a lesion location itself, as
that region has been destroyed and has no neurophysio-
logical activity. Finally, differences in functional connectivity
observed in patients likely represent both lesion-induced dys-
function and compensatory responses. Lesion network map-
ping may identify regions more likely to be dysfunctional as
a consequence of the lesion itself.
As with previous studies using lesion network mapping
(Boes et al., 2015), we found that both positive and nega-
tive correlation with the lesion location identified brain re-
gions implicated in symptom expression. However, unlike
this initial study, here we found that both positive and
negative correlations identified regions likely involved in
symptom expression in the same syndrome. Why one func-
tional deficit would be based on positive correlation to the
lesion location and another based on negative correlation
remains unclear. One straightforward hypothesis is that re-
gions positively correlated with a lesion location will have
diminished activity, while anti-correlated regions will have
increased activity, following the lesion. This simple frame-
work is supported by analysis of lesions causing visual or
auditory hallucinations, which are anti-correlated with re-
gions that become hyperactive in these conditions (Boes
et al., 2015). However, there are also exceptions to this
rule, such as post-stroke pain (Boes et al., 2015). As
such, we suggest that regions that are positively correlated
or anti-correlated with a lesion location are likely to
become dysregulated following the lesion, but whether
this dysregulation is different depending on the sign of
the correlation remains unclear.
Limitations
Several potential confounds in our lesion network mapping
method have been previously addressed (Boes et al., 2015).
For example, a normative connectome can be used to
approximate connectivity in patients (Fox et al., 2014), re-
sults are similar with a connectome from older subjects
age-matched to the lesion cohort (Boes et al., 2015), and
results are similar with different connectome processing
strategies, including global signal regression (Boes et al.,
2015). We have also previously shown that 2D lesions
from the literature can be used to approximate a 3D
lesion (Boes et al., 2015). However, we also confirmed
this result in the present dataset using our two cases
where 3D lesions were available (spatial correlations be-
tween the connectivity maps from 2D and 3D lesions
were 0.91 and 0.89, respectively; see Supplementary Fig. 3).
Nevertheless, important limitations remain. First, lesion-
network analysis identifies regions functionally connected
to lesion sites, but this does not prove that these regions
are dysfunctional in patients following the lesion. We
cannot currently predict whether regions connected to
lesion locations will show increased activity, decreased ac-
tivity, or a more complex pattern of dysfunction (Boes
et al., 2015). Functional neuroimaging in patients with
active symptoms is necessary. This is difficult in rare syn-
dromes; however, our prediction of retrosplenial dysfunc-
tion is supported by an functional MRI study of a single
patient with lesion-induced Capgras (Thiel et al., 2014).
Our prediction of right frontal cortex dysfunction in these
patients remains a testable but unproven hypothesis.
A second limitation is that tasks designed to measure
expectation violation experimentally are likely an oversim-
plification of the ‘belief evaluation’ process thought to be
necessary for rejection or perpetuation of a perceptual mis-
identification. Further, one could argue that selecting this
task for our meta-analysis is a source of bias. These con-
cerns are mitigated, but not eliminated by two analyses.
First, we showed that our results remain significant using
two additional meta-analyses of expectation violation: (i)
an independent and pre-existing ALE meta-analysis of
‘oddball’ tasks; and (ii) a meta-analysis of expectation vio-
lation of cognitive beliefs. Second, we replicated connectiv-
ity to our expectation violation network in an independent
cohort of lesion-induced delusion patients.
Conclusion
Because of the complex and bizarre nature of neuropsychi-
atric syndromes, it is often presumed that concurrent gen-
eralized cognitive dysfunction from delirium, psychiatric
disease, dementia, or a second lesion is required (Levine
and Grek, 1984; Rabins et al., 1991; Devine et al.,
2014). Here we propose a mechanism by which a single
lesion can cause complex symptoms based on that lesion’s
precise location within the human connectome, without the
need for pre-existing or hidden pathology. Our results are
consistent with prior theories regarding delusional misiden-
tifications
(Ellis
and
Young,
1990;
Hirstein
and
Ramachandran, 1997; Hirstein, 2010; Feinberg, 2011;
Darby and Caplan, 2016) and theories of delusion forma-
tion more generally (Coltheart, 2007, 2010; Corlett et al.,
2010), and provide potential neuroanatomical correlates
for impaired familiarity perception and belief evaluation
in these patients.
