Evolution-informed forecasting of seasonal
influenza A (H3N2)
Xiangjun Du,1 Aaron A. King,2 Robert J. Woods,3 Mercedes Pascual1,4*
Interpandemic or seasonal influenza A, currently subtypes H3N2 and H1N1, exacts an enormous annual burden
both in terms of human health and economic impact. Incidence prediction ahead of season remains a challenge
largely because of the virus’ antigenic evolution. We propose a forecasting approach that incorporates evolu-
tionary change into a mechanistic epidemiological model. The proposed models are simple enough that their
parameters can be estimated from retrospective surveillance data. These models link amino acid sequences of
hemagglutinin epitopes with a transmission model for seasonal H3N2 influenza, also informed by H1N1 levels.
With a monthly time series of H3N2 incidence in the United States for more than 10 years, we demonstrate the
feasibility of skillful prediction for total cases ahead of season, with a tendency to underpredict monthly peak
epidemic size, and an accurate real-time forecast for the 2016/2017 influenza season.
INTRODUCTION
Interpandemic or seasonal influenza is responsible for an average of
about 1 billion cases globally, including 3 to 5 million cases of severe
illness and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths annually (1). Since its first occur-
rence in 1968, seasonal H3N2 influenza A has continually circulated in
the human population and is currently the major cause of seasonal
influenza morbidity and mortality (2). Subtype H1N1 and two major
lineages of influenza B also contribute today to seasonal burden, with
their importance varying with the particular season and region. The
sustained “success” of influenza viruses responsible for seasonal out-
breaks, especially H3N2, stems from their ability to evolve and escape
theimmune systembymodifyingtheirsurface proteins(3).Phylogenetic
trees depicting evolutionary changes in influenza (H3N2) viruses illus-
trate rapid drift with successive and punctuated replacement of one an-
tigenic type by another (4, 5). The past decade has seen significant
conceptual advances in the understanding of these phylogenetic
patterns, enabled by computational and statistical advances at the
interface of transmission dynamics and virus evolution (5–12). There
is now a considerable interest in translating these conceptual advances
into actual prediction at the population level that would inform the up-
date of vaccines and epidemic preparedness. Because of virus evolution,
the seasonal influenza vaccine varies in efficacy and requires frequent
updates. The composition of the trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines,
chosen from circulating H3N2, H1N1, and type B strains, is reviewed
biannually (in February for the Northern Hemisphere), with changes
proposed and coordinated by the World Health Organization
(WHO) when strains considered most likely responsible for next year’s
outbreak differ sufficiently from those represented in the current vaccine.
The decision results from a complex consultation process involving the
WHO Global Surveillance Network and the Collaborating Centers for
Reference and Research on Influenza.
The challenge of influenza prediction has progressed largely along
two separate tracks. The first one seeks to predict evolutionary change
with computational methods based on phylogenies and mutation
patterns in the surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) (13–17). The result-
ing predictions of successful lineages and their relative frequencies for
the future season do not, however, provide precise information on
absolute incidence. The second track generates real-time incidence
forecasts of influenza-like illness (ILI) on the basis of mathematical
models describing the transmission dynamics of influenza viruses
(18, 19). With data assimilation methods (20), these models must
be fitted within each season because of season-to-season viral evolution
(21–25). With such models, the fact that one needs to wait until the
outbreak starts limits the lead time of epidemiological prediction.
Here, we bridge the gap between these two approaches and pro-
pose an epidemiological model specifically for seasonal H3N2 influ-
enza that incorporates information on the evolutionary change of
the virus. The resulting model is sufficiently parsimonious that
parameter estimation based on retrospective surveillance records is
possible. A key feature is its use of an evolutionary index of virus
innovation constructed using readily available sequence data. The
goal is to generate H3N2 incidence forecasts before the season
begins, significantly earlier than what is currently possible. We illus-
trate two model formulations for H3N2 in the United States between
2002 and 2016 and produce a forecast for the upcoming 2016/2017
influenza season.
RESULTS
The monthly incidence variability from 2002 to 2016 for the whole
United States is shown in Fig. 1A for reported cases of influenza type
A, for subtypes H3N2 and H1N1 (including both seasonal H1N1 and
pandemic H1N1), and type B. The time series are computed as the
product of the ILI incidence rate, the proportion of ILI samples that
tested positive for influenza, the subtype proportion, and the U.S.
population size. Thus, incidence data are extrapolated to the U.S.
population from outpatients in a network of health care providers,
with untyped influenza specimens assigned to H3N2, H1N1, and B,
respectively, on the basis of the proportions from the U.S. surveil-
lance system (see Materials and Methods for details). The temporal
variability of H3N2 exhibits seasonal outbreaks, whose size varies
considerably from one year to the next. This interannual variability
can result not only from epidemiological processes such as the loss of
immunity to a specific variant of the virus (26) but also to a large degree,
from the antigenic evolution of the virus (27) and the combined and
complex interactions of the two (28, 29).

 We measure antigenic innovation or evolutionary change of the
virus at a given time (relative to a window of time in the past) using a
novel evolutionary index readily computed from available sequences for
the HA1 domain. The idea is to use amino acid sequences to quantify
the change in the virus’ antigenic properties relative to those the human
population has recently experienced. We therefore focus on sequences
that encode epitopes known to be important for antibody binding and
in which antigenic evolution is commonly observed (14, 30, 31). We
define the index as a weighted average distance between the current
viruses and their predecessors in the past. So that more recent sequences
are weighted more heavily than older ones, the weights are taken to be a
decaying function of the intersequence interval. Figure 1B illustrates the
estimated index.
Before examining predictions of the “full” model that considers
both epidemiology and the evolutionary index, we evaluate the
ability of different models, encapsulating different degrees of
complexity, to retrospectively explain the temporal patterns in
the data from 2002 to 2016. To establish a baseline against which
to evaluate the full model, we begin with a simpler formulation for
the population dynamics of H3N2 that includes only influenza epide-
miology and the seasonality of transmission. This basic model follows
the structure of the well-known compartmental susceptible-infected-
recovered-susceptible (SIRS) formulation, which divides the popula-
tion into classes for susceptible (nonimmune), infected, and recovered
(immune) individuals (Fig. 1C). For the purpose of model comparisons,
we rely initially on the whole temporal extent of the data (2002 to 2016)
to fit the models and infer parameter values. Figure 2A shows that
simulations of the basic model reproduce the average seasonality of
incidence but fail to capture its interannual variation.
Several variants of the epidemiological model were considered
next, starting with the effect of temporal variation in the incidence
of H1N1. We find a significant negative correlation between annual
incidence of H3N2 and H1N1 (r = −0.60, P = 0.02) but no clear
relationship between annual incidence of type B and H3N2 or H1N1
(r = 0.42 and −0.33, P = 0.13 and 0.25, respectively). Given these
findings and the observation that disease burden due to type B in
humans is typically lower than that due to H3N2 or H1N1 in the
United States (32, 33), we postulate an effect of H1N1, but not B,
on the dynamics of H3N2 and do so as a covariate affecting the
system as an external observed variable (in the “basic-H1” model,
fig. S1A). We also allow measurement error to differ between the
summer (1 April to 30 September) and winter (1 October to 31 March)
seasons, reasoning that the reporting rate is more variable outside the
winter (transmission) season (34). (Hereafter, we refer to the year/year
+ 1 influenza “season” as the period from 1 July of the current calen-
dar year to 30 June of the next calendar year; for example, the 2008/
2009 influenza season corresponds to the period between 1 July 2008
and 30 June 2009). Additionally, we relax the assumption of a linear
dependence of the force of infection on the number of current infected
individuals, allowing a nonlinear functional form and the potential
for subexponential growth of the epidemic curve (in the “refined”
model, fig. S1B). This functional form has been found effective in
the modeling of a number of different infectious diseases, as a means
of parameterizing processes operating at scales smaller than can be
explicitly represented (35–37). Finally, we consider a version of the
refined model in which the (nonparametric) periodic function in
the transmission rate is replaced by a function of specific humidity
(the “humidity” model, fig. S1C) (21, 38, 39). Although all these
model variants improve the fit of the data (Table 1), they still fail
to properly capture the interannual variability in incidence (fig. S1).
Of these purely epidemiological models, we retain the best one, that is,
the refined model, which includes H1N1, season-dependent measure-
ment error, and subexponential epidemic growth, and turn next to
whether the inclusion of an index of evolutionary change can improve
on this foundation.
Because evolutionary novelty increases the probability that a virus
escapes existing protective immunity and thereby achieves more effi-
cient transmission, we incorporated the innovation index as an external
driver of the SIRS model, by allowing it to modulate either the duration
of immunity or the transmission rate, or both. The model that includes
evolutionary change in the duration of immunity was best able to
explain the data (the “continuous” model) (Table 1). Simulations
with the estimated parameters further demonstrate the improved
performance of this formulation, with the median incidence repro-
ducing the main trends in the interannual variation (Fig. 2B). As a
general result (Table 1), the models that incorporate evolutionary

 information are significantly better than those that do not (P < 0.05,
likelihood ratio test). Among the former, the models incorporating
evolutionary change just in the immunity loss or in both this
parameter and transmission (the “immunity loss/transmission”
model) are comparable to each other but perform significantly better
than that with an effect only in transmission (the “transmission”
model). A degree of similarity between the two best models is to be
expected in view of the fact that these two epidemiological parameters
determine the overall infection rate, making it difficult to disentangle an
effect on the number of susceptibles from one on the per-susceptible
risk of infection. Our results here indicate that inclusion of the evolu-
tionary driver as a modulator of the duration of immunity is sufficient.
Our best model so far included a smoothly changing measure of
evolutionary change based purely on virus genotype. It is recognized,
however, that the genotype-phenotype map for antigenic properties
of the virus is discontinuous, such that virus strains cluster antigenically
and switches between clusters affect the population dynamics and phy-
lodynamics of H3N2 in punctuated fashion (4, 10). In particular, re-
corded antigenic cluster transitions are consistently followed by larger
outbreaks (Fig. 1A). We found that higher values of our estimated index
of evolutionary change tended to precede a winter season with an an-
tigenic cluster transition (compare Fig. 1, A and B). This observation
and what is known about the genotype-phenotype map of the virus
(4, 40, 41) led us to a second evolutionary change index based on cluster
transitions. In this “cluster” model, the effect of a cluster transition is
punctuated and localized in time: The rate of immunity loss is varied
only during the summer season that precedes the winter season with an
antigenic cluster transition. Specifically, the rate of immunity loss only
during that time becomes a function of the degree of evolutionary
change; with this change now measured by comparing current virus
sequences to those 2 years ago, a time scale characteristic of cluster
transitions (4). This time scale is also consistent with our estimate of
the effective evolutionary time (fig. S9), which is much shorter than
the estimate of the basic latent period (fig. S10). The resulting model
performs better than the best model with continuous evolutionary
change (Table 1 and Fig. 2C), although the most significant
difference is between purely epidemiological models and those that

 incorporate evolutionary information based on model comparisons
with the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the likelihood ratio
test (Table 1).
With our best model, the cluster model, we now turn to the task of
predicting H3N2 incidence before the influenza season begins. For this
purpose, we divide the data into a “training” section (2002 to 2011) used
to fit the models and an “out-of-fit” one (2011 to 2016) used to evaluate
their prediction accuracy. The implementation of the model for
forecasting purposes requires particular assumptions on the drivers in
the system because these observed quantities will, by definition, not
yet be available over the time windows we wish to predict. For H1N1
incidence, we make the simplifying assumption that monthly
averages for this quantity over the training set provide a sufficient
approximation. Additionally, for the cluster model, an upcoming
season dominated by a novel antigenic cluster needs to be anticipated
in the summer before the transmission season. For this, we developed
and tested a rule based on a published genotype-phenotype map for
prediction of new antigenic variants (40). Specifically, when the propor-
tion of antigenic variants (PAVs) accumulated during the summer sea-
son exceeded a given threshold, we took this to be predictive of a cluster
transition in the next winter season (figs. S2 and S3; see Materials and
Methods for details). Figure 3A shows the resulting retrospective pre-
dictions together with observations for each of the last five influenza
seasons from 2011/2012 to 2015/2016. Two criteria were used to quan-
tify prediction accuracy. The first one compared the absolute monthly
observed incidence to the medians of monthly predicted incidence from
1000 simulations. Predictions and observations are significantly
correlated (r = 0.87 and r2 = 0.76 for the monthly data; r = 0.95 and
r2 = 0.91 for the seasonal data; see Fig. 3 for the data that include the
most recent 2016/2017 season and fig. S4). Moreover, the observations
mostly fell within the 95% uncertainty intervals defined by the 2.5 and
97.5% quantiles of the simulations. Although the models tend to under-
predict the absolute value of peak incidence, they do capture the overall
interannual behavior of the trends reflected in both low and high
seasons (Fig. 3B). The second criterion evaluates the model’s ability to
predict an outbreak season by computing the probability of surpassing a
selected incidence value deemed high by public health practitioners. We
are interested here in evaluating the risk of an anomalous “high” season
relative to a typical season in the past and relative to a threshold level of
cases of interest to public health. We consider first a threshold equal to
the median of seasonaltotalsobservedoverthe training data set. A given
influenza season is forecasted as high or low risk level depending on the
proportion of simulations that exceed the median, with the critical pro-
portion that separates low and high levels chosen on the basis of receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves (fig. S5). Specifically, we predict a
high risk level when more than 40% of the 1000 simulations surpass the
median. All five seasons were predicted accurately on the basis of this
criterion (Table 2).
To further evaluate the prediction ability, we considered hindcast
predictions, by removing one season at a time during the period from
influenza season 2003/2004 to 2010/2011 and predicting its incidence,
with the model parameters reestimated each time on the basis of the
remaining data and exactly the same search strategy. Because there
are multiannual correlations in the data, this test is less stringent and
realistic than the one based on multiple sequential out-of-fit seasons
attheendofthetimeseries.Nevertheless,itallowsustoextendprediction
evaluationanddemonstrateshighpredictionaccuracy(Fig.3andtableS1).
Encouraged by these results, we present a “real-time” forecast
prepared before the 2016/2017 influenza season and based on the data
available up to June 2016 by the end of the 2015/2016 influenza season.
Notable evolutionary change relative to previous viruses is indicated by
our evolutionary index during the 2015/2016 influenza season (Fig. 1B),
consistent with the observation that a number of antigenic variants were
also accumulating over this period (fig. S2). Concurrently, H1N1 domi-
nated the 2015/2016 influenza season, which would have resulted in an
increased number of individuals susceptible to H3N2. The cluster
model predicted a high risk level for seasonal H3N2 influenza in the
2016/2017 influenza season for the United States (Table 2), with a pre-
dicted annual incidence rate of 0.11 (95% confidence intervals, 0.07 and
0.15) (table S2), consistent with observations (Fig. 3 and Table 2).
Forecast results based on the continuous model also capture the in-
terannual trend in the size of epidemics (fig. S6) and correctly predict
risk levels above the 50% epidemic threshold (median) for the period
between 2011 and 2017 (table S3). The quality of the forecasts is lower,
however, than that obtained with our best model (the cluster model)
(compare Fig. 3 and fig. S6). We also note that the 2016/2017 season
is correctly forecasted as high risk but that its predicted peak size is over-
estimated and its predicted timing is earlier than that observed (fig. S6).
Another approach in the literature to predicting specific H3N2 in-
cidence is based on its correlation with antigenic change, as measured
by the hemagglutination inhibition assay (42). Our approach exhibits a
higher correlation between seasonal observations and predictions (0.83
for the whole U.S. data set from 2002 to 2016 and 0.90 for the testing
data set from 2011 to 2017 compared to 0.52 between antigenic change
and H3N2 incidence for the period between 1998 and 2009) (Fig. 3B
and fig. S7).
Finally, to further test the general approach, we applied it to one
region of the United States—U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) region 3 (see Materials and Methods). This choice pro-
vides a smaller surveillance area for a fairly populous part of the country
under moderate climate conditions. A robust result is that the models
with evolutionary information are significantly better at capturing the
dynamics of seasonal H3N2 influenza than those without it (table S4),
although which particular evolutionary index is best can differ.
Forecasts based on the best cluster and continuous models capture both
the interannual variation of the outbreaks and disease risk for this U.S.
region (fig. S8 and table S5).
DISCUSSION
Our results demonstrate the feasibility of improving epidemiological
forecasts by incorporating information on evolutionary change into
mechanistic models. Comparisons between models with and without
this information show significant differences in their ability to capture
the interannual variation in incidence data, which underscores the
importance of evolutionary change in the epidemiological dynamics
of seasonal influenza. Our best models are able to capture the temporal
behavior of observed incidence for H3N2 in the recent past in the
United States, and they provide the means to lengthen the lead time
of prediction so that effective forecasts can be based in the summer,
before the transmission season begins.
We predict interannual disease risk rather than finer-scale outbreak
timing during the season; that is, we forecast whether the upcoming sea-
son will be anomalously large or small. Timing itself has been the target
of existing within-season prediction efforts (22–25), which are better
suited for this purpose and could be applied in tandem with our ap-
proach. Earlier forecasts of incidence dynamics further inform public
health preparedness and can aid public health efforts by indicating

 when to expect a surge in demand for health care resources and infra-
structure. They can also contribute to the development of control strat-
egies that take risk levels into consideration.
The use of evolutionary drivers in epidemiological dynamics
follows an earlier study by Axelsen et al. (43) on long-term ILI in-
cidence prediction in Tel Aviv, Israel.
Their model incorporated the timing
of known discrete antigenic changes
in seasonal influenza and demon-
strated the importance of considering
these discrete antigenic jumps and
their interaction with the waxing
and waning of immunity levels in
the population. Prediction of multi-
annual temporal patterns over multi-
ple seasons was shown possible after
the observation of such an event and
as long as another one did not recur,
which is an impediment to real-time
forecasting. A number of more mech-
anistic models coupling evolution and
transmission dynamics have also been
developed to address theoretical ques-
tions on the phylodynamics of seasonal
influenza (6, 7, 10, 12). Because these
individual-based, stochastic formula-
tions are high-dimensional and com-
putationally expensive to work with,
they are not well-suited for the repeated
estimation of parameters from time
series data on reported cases or for
epidemiological prediction.
Here, we have shown that readily
available sequences of the virus can be
used to construct an evolutionary covariate in both continuous and dis-
crete versions. In the continuous model, the time scale of the virus’ an-
tigenic evolution is relatively short, with an average effective time of
about 16 months. At the same time, the estimated duration of homo-
typic immunity is relatively long—30 years or even longer. The impor-
tance of incorporating the short-term changes emphasizes the critical
role of timely virological surveillance for identifying new emerging
variants. Another intriguing observation related to the continuous mea-
sure of evolutionary change applied to our model is that the H1N1 pan-
demic of 2009 coincided with a valley in H3N2 fitness. This suggests that
such times may provide a window of opportunity for the emergence of
new types (including for cluster transitions of H3N2 itself). Thus, our
evolutionary index, together with the proposed method for identifying
and anticipating antigenic cluster transitions, could provide useful
complements to the current surveillance system.
Our models made several simplifying assumptions, which can be
investigated further and used to improve the approach in the future.
The compartmental model did not include age structure (44) or social
structure (45), proper inclusion of which might help to correct the
underestimation of incidence peaks in this study. The evolutionary
indices mainly consider antigenic change based on mutations in HA;
these measures could be improved by further knowledge of antigenic
phenotype (46, 47), including other viral segments like neuraminidase
(48). Incorporating advances concerning antigenic prediction could be
particularly relevant to further lengthen the lead time of forecasts, given
the February timing of vaccine decisions for the next influenza season in
the Northern Hemisphere. In addition, other factors affecting the fitness
of the virus could be considered (14, 49), including receptor binding
ability related to cell entry and transmission (50). Vaccination in-
formation could also be incorporated in the population dynamics.
Table 2. H3N2 risk level forecasts for the United States based on the
cluster model. Seasonal risk level for H3N2 influenza virus is defined as
high or low for each season compared to a reference level defined as the
median of the seasonal total H3N2 incidence cases in the corresponding
training data set. We defined an observed season as H3N2 high risk, when
the observed total H3N2 incidence surpasses the reference level; and an
H3N2 low-risk season otherwise. For the forecasts, the percentage of 1000
simulations that exhibit an H3N2 high risk was obtained. When this per-
centage exceeded 40% (a level chosen based on fig. S5), we forecasted an
H3N2 high-risk season. Otherwise, an H3N2 low-risk season was predicted.

Fig. 3. H3N2 incidence forecasts based on the cluster model for the Unites States. (A) Monthly forecasts and (B) pre-
dictions versus observations of seasonal incidence totals. The different colors in both panels correspond to the following:
leave-one-out cross-validation (for each influenza season from 2003/2004 to 2010/2011; in blue), retrospective forecasts (for
each out-of-fit influenza season from 2011/2012 to 2015/2016; in red), and a real-time forecast for the 2016/2017 influenza
season (in green). These predictions for cross-validations are simulated on a seasonal basis from estimated initial conditions
starting in June and based on parameters estimated with all the data in the training data set with the target season
excluded. The forecasts for the out-of-fit period are also simulated on a seasonal basis from estimated initial conditions
starting in June but are based on parameters estimated with all the data up to that point in time. The average monthly
H1N1 incidence from this training data set was used for forecasting purposes because the observation of this driver
quantity would not be available. Similarly, the quantities specifying the evolutionary change of the virus were extra-
polated as the sequences required for their computation would not be available (see Materials and Methods). The black
curve is the monthly observed H3N2 incidence; the colored curve is the predicted monthly median incidence with shaded
95% uncertainty intervals (2.5 and 97.5% quantiles) from 1000 random simulations with the best models. The seasonal
incidence is the sum of the monthly incidence for a specific influenza season. The observed incidence data for the
2016/2017 influenza season, which were not yet available when this study was conducted, are shown with the dotted
line (and based on data from the weekly U.S. influenza surveillance report until week 14 ending on 8 April 2017). There
is a significant correlation (P < 0.05) between observed incidence and median incidence, from the cross-validation
forecasts for both monthly data (r = 0.66 and r 2 = 0.44) and seasonal data (r = 0.88 and r2 = 0.77) and from both
the retrospective and real forecasts (r = 0.81 and r 2 = 0.67 for monthly data, fig. S4; r = 0.90 and r2 = 0.81 for seasonal
data; Pearson’s product moment correlations).

 We decoupled the two-way interaction between subtypes H1N1 and
H3N2 by including the effect of the former as a driver on the population
dynamics of the latter. Although we observed that the dynamics of
H3N2 was most strongly determined by its own evolutionary change,
a more realistic model incorporating interactions between H3N2 and
H1N1, and perhaps type B, could be considered (51). Our model can
also be applied at a finer spatial resolution and to other regions, espe-
cially in Asia, where the likely source of evolutionary novelty for the
seasonal influenza virus is to be found (5, 52). Preliminary investigation
indicates that the general framework could be used in capturing and
forecasting regional population dynamics of seasonal H3N2 influenza
in the United States. Because immigration and emigration are also im-
portant processes in determining the local dynamics of seasonal influ-
enza [for example, (53, 54)], a further step would consist of coupling
regional dynamics to represent the effect of movement and the depen-
dencies between adjacent regions. Similarly, at a larger scale, one could
incorporate information on global influenza circulatory patterns into
the model. Finally, ways to better extrapolate the evolutionary covariate
itself beyond the summer should be addressed. Overall, the fact that
incorporation of pathogen evolution into epidemiological models in-
creases forecasting skill should embolden future efforts to further
improve on the model presented here.
The limits to lead times in influenza prediction are not set by chaotic
dynamics, as is the case for the weather system; they are determined
instead by the stochastic nature of virus evolution. Thus, the increased
availability of genetic sequence data from surveillance efforts around the
globe can inform, in important ways, epidemiological prediction. One
key limitation identified in our work is the low and variable number of
sequences outside the transmission season, when this information
would be most critical. Improvements to the general idea presented here
will result from current efforts on purely evolutionary forecasting,
which can provide better means to quantify antigenic change of the
virus (13, 14, 17, 40, 46, 47) and to lengthen lead times further by con-
catenating evolutionary and evo-epidemiological prediction. Similarly,
increased understanding of the virus’ genotype-phenotype map willalso
further inform this kind of effort. Ultimately, in the same way that rou-
tine weather forecasting provided the impetus for much better sampling
of the climate system, incidence prediction is computationally feasible
but will ultimately depend on the quality, depth, and resolution of
epidemiological and genetic surveillance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
To predict H3N2 incidence ahead of the season for the United States at
the national level, an epidemiological model was formulated that incor-
porates an effect of evolutionary change in the virus on selected param-
eters (waning immunity rate, transmission rate, or both of these). A
series of formulations were compared via model selection to evaluate
the importance of including such a change with two indices of evolu-
tionary innovation based on genetic sequences, respectively, continuous
and discrete in time. Model parameters were estimated with a sequential
Monte Carlo method implementing an iterated filtering algorithm. The
predictive ability of the best models is evaluated on the basis of both
hindcasts and forecasts, by training the models with only a part of
the data. Data from October 2002 to June 2016 were used in this study
to focus on a period long enough to inform parameter inference and to
avoid a considerably lower sampling effort of genetic sequences earlier
on with no surveillance data for the summer season. The robustness of
the proposed framework was tested by its further application to data
from one U.S. region, the U.S. HHS region 3, including Delaware,
the District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West
Virginia.
Data
HA protein sequences of seasonal H3N2 influenza virus from the
United States were downloaded from the Global Initiative on
Sharing Avian Influenza Data (55). Sequences were then aligned
with MUSCLE v3.7 using default settings (56). Undetermined amino
acids were replaced by gaps, and only the HA1 domain was retained
for further analysis. Outliers based on a reconstructed phylogenetic tree
using FastTree 2 (57) with default settings were manually removed.
Outpatient illness surveillance data and viral surveillance data were
downloaded from FluView of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) (58). Seasonal and pandemic H1N1 influenza
were combined together as seasonal H1N1 influenza, and the two
lineages of seasonal B influenza were combined as seasonal B influenza.
Untyped influenza-positive specimens were assigned to either H3N2,
H1N1, or B, according to their proportions from typed specimens.
The final weekly subtype-specific incidence was calculated as the pro-
duct of ILI incidence rate, proportion of ILI samples that tested positive
for influenza, subtype-specific proportion, and population size. Weekly
incidence data were then aggregated to monthly data. Monthly national-
level population estimates were downloaded from the U.S. Census
Bureau (59). Specific humidity data for the United States were obtained
from the National Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 products
(60). These primary measurements are provided on a 0.125° grid.
National data were averaged over all grids for the monthly data.
The epidemiological, virological, and population data for the regional
study were downloaded from the same websites as for the national data.
The regional data (ILI incidence rate, proportion of ILI samples that
tested positive for influenza, and type/subtype-specific proportion)
are sparser and therefore noisier, with frequent data missing during
the low season. Thus, the incidence data were smoothed from peak
(time point with the highest incidence during a winter season) to peak
by local linear regression using a 4-week window.
Epidemiological model
A compartmental SIRS model was formulated that follows the flow
of the population in susceptible, infected (and infectious), and re-
covered classes for seasonal H3N2 influenza, with the following
equations:

S, I, and R denote the number of susceptible, infected, and re-

noise simulated by a gamma distribution G (see Additional description
of materials and methods in the Supplementary Materials for the
model version where seasonality depends on humidity) (61). e(t) is
the average latent period at time t, given by:
eðtÞ ¼ e0e�weEðtÞ

where e0 is the basic latent period, and we is the scaling factor. g is the
average infectious period. An additional RH1 class was designed to
track the reduction in susceptibles for H3N2 influenza due to cross-
immunity and therefore the protected population due to infection by
seasonal H1N1 influenza. The rate of susceptible individuals tem-
porarily moved to the RH1 class was measured by:
LH1 t
ð Þ ¼ CH1ðtÞ

ð7Þ
where CH1(t) is the observed incidence due to seasonal H1N1 in-
fluenza, and φ is the reporting rate for H3N2, which is scaled here
for H1N1 with the factor wH1. The average latent period for indi-
viduals in the RH1 class returning to the susceptible class is denoted
by eH1.
A measurement model is implemented that relies on a normal
distribution and transforms the incidence in the transmission model
to the actual observations by the reporting system (see Additional
description of materials and methods in the Supplementary
Materials). Specific modifications for the regional model are also
described in this section of the Supplementary Materials.
Evolutionary index
Two quantities were formulated to incorporate information on virus
evolution into the epidemiological model. The first one, which varies
continuously in time, is described here; the second, which varies
discontinuously to reflect the punctuated antigenic change of the virus,
is described below under Antigenic cluster transitions and discrete evo-
lutionary index.
An evolutionary index, E(t), was used to measure the degree of
evolutionary change of the virus at current time t (in months) com-
pared to historical strains in the past. This index is therefore for-
mulated as a weighted sum of normalized distance between current
viruses and those in the past for amino acid sequences encoding
epitopes of the HA protein. Its general expression is given by:
E t
ð Þ ¼ ∑
n
s¼0d s; t
ð
Þ
˜e�sþ1
q
ð8Þ
where dðs; tÞ
˜ denotes a normalized distance between sequences at
month t and those in previous season s back in time, and n is the
total number of previous seasons including the current one for
which we set s = 0. Here, n = 19 and t = 1, … l (where l is the length
of the incidence time series in months starting from October 2002).
In the formula for E(t), changes relative to more recent viruses cir-
culating in the population have a stronger weight than those relative to
earlier viruses, and this weight decays exponentially back in time
(scaled by q in Eq. 8). The final computation requires a series of ad-
ditional steps because of geographic and temporal biases in numbers
of sampled sequences and the consideration of months and seasons in
computing distances (see details and biological interpretation in Ad-
ditional description of materials and methods in the Supplementary
Materials).
Antigenic cluster transitions and discrete evolutionary index
Antigenic cluster transitions were identified on the basis of influenza
season summary reports for seasons between 2003 and 2013 (62) and
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports for seasons between 2013 and
2016 (63–66) from U.S. CDC. An antigenic cluster transition is defined
here as a season when more than half of the viruses were antigenically
similar to the new vaccine strain. On the basis of this criterion, antigenic
cluster transition seasons are 2003/2004, 2004/2005, 2007/2008, 2009/
2010, 2012/2013, and 2014/2015. For the 2006/2007 influenza season,
although there was a change in vaccine strain, most of the circulating
strains were not antigenically similar to the new vaccine strain (62). As a
result, no antigenic cluster transition was considered for the 2006/2007
influenza season. For the 2013/2014 influenza season, although there
was a change in vaccine strain from A/Victoria/361/2011 to A/Texas/
50/2012, the vaccine strains were antigenically similar (66). Thus, here
too, this vaccine strain change was not considered an indication of an
antigenic cluster transition.
For the model that incorporates evolutionary change through cluster
transitions, cluster transitions are identified first on the basis of se-
quences, and when one such transition is identified, the degree of the
change is then quantified. This change influences model parameters
(rate of immunity loss here) in the form of a step function; that is, in
the cluster model, an effect of evolutionary change in the virus is only
applied to the epidemiological parameters when a cluster transition
is identified (or predicted), and at this time, a measure of the magnitude
of the change in the virus relative to the recent past is used as a covariate.
In practice, when the model is implemented for actual forecasting, the
emergence and establishment of a new cluster need to be predicted first.
This first step is implemented with a cluster transition rule based on a
genotype-phenotype mapfor H3N2 previously publishedfor bothiden-
tifying and predicting antigenic cluster transitions purely based on
sequence data without having to rely on antigenic assay data (40). This

 first step allows the prediction of an antigenic cluster transition ahead of
the transmission season during the summer. Afterthe identification (for
retrospective data) or prediction (for out-of-fit data/forecasting
purposes) of the emergence of a new antigenic cluster, a second step
quantifies how much the new viruses differ from those in the recent
past. For this purpose, virus sequences between September and the pre-
vious second season (our “reference” season) are compared for two rea-
sons: First, the average effective period back in time estimated with
parameter q for the evolutionary index is about 2 years (fig. S9), and
second, this period is close to the average time of cluster replacements (4).
The following quantity was defined to specifically measure evo-
lutionary change (at the monthly scale) for the month of September:
EDðtÞ ¼
d2;Sept:
0
for t within summer seasons that precede winter
seasons with an antigenic cluster transition
otherwise

where d2,Sept. was calculated as a normalized distance based on epitope
regions of HA1 between sequences for September of the current sea-
son and sequences of the previous second season (for example, d2,Sept.
in 2000 was calculated on the basis of sequences from September of
current 2000/2001 influenza season and 1998/1999 influenza season,
that is s = 2 in the notation introduced above). Because there are typ-
ically a limited number of sequences for the summer season, distances
calculated on the basis of those sequences can vary considerably de-
pending on sampling effort. Therefore, a final value of d2,Sept. was ob-
tained with a similar procedure than that used for calculating dðs; tÞ
˜
above. For the purpose of fitting the time series data, the resulting dis-
tance quantity ED(t) was introduced in the model as described in Eq.
6. When the goal is instead that of specifically forecasting ahead of the
transmission season, cluster transitions need to be anticipated, and the
value of ED(t) was computed accordingly. The approach taken for this
purpose is described in the section below on Forecasts.
Forecasts
Forecasts of incidence dynamics with the cluster model were obtained
for a given season through three steps. First, the cluster model was
trained on the basis of the data set before the target season using exactly
the same procedure described above. Second, the model with the best
likelihood was chosen and used to estimate the initial conditions for the
forecasts. These initial conditions require estimates of the “hidden” (un-
measured) variables in the model, S, I, R, and RH1 , in June of the year for
which the predictions will be made. Maximum likelihood by iterated
filtering (MIF) allows one to estimate these variables as the filtered states
of the system at that time, given the observations of the cases. Third,
forecasts were obtained through forward simulations for the target season
with the selected model and starting from these initial conditions.
Because the system of equations in our models is nonautonomous,
including external variables or drivers whose values must be specified
independently from the dynamics, real forecasts (versus retrospective
ones) require specifying assumptions for these drivers whose observa-
tion in the future is, by definition, unavailable. Specifically, information
is required on both CH1(t) in LH1(t) and d2,Sept. in ED(t) for the simula-
tions. First, for CH1(t), the average monthly value from the training data
set was used. This is a simplification and a rough approximation but a
reasonable choice in the absence of modeling the coupled dynamics of
H1N1 and H3N2. This approximation is most likely to be sufficient,
when predictability of our models is evaluated, if the population dy-
namics of H3N2 is most strongly driven by its own evolutionary
change rather than by the precise levels of H1N1. Second, the evo-
lutionary change between new and old clusters is also needed, and
this quantity can be extrapolated linearly as the value for September
using the same procedure for calculating d2,Sept. above but based on
sequences only from October of the previous year to June of the cur-
rent year.
In addition, the weekly reports used to identify antigenic cluster
transitions will not yet be available at the time of forecasting. Pre-
viously, a naïve Bayes model was developed as a genotype-phenotype to
translate sequence changes in HA to antigenic changes and specifically
calculate an odds ratio measuring antigenic similarity between a pair of
strains, given their sequences (40). On the basis of this method, quar-
terly measures of the PAVs were calculated here. This quantity provides
the proportion of pairs that are antigenically different (odds ratio < 1)
among all pairs between sequences of a specific quarter and those in the
previous year. Again, the same subsampling process was applied but on
the basis of time points for quarters, not months.
To predict a cluster transition, rules were examined that combine a
local increase in PAV with this quantity exceeding a threshold. This
cutoff value was selected on the basis of the ROC curve (lower bound
of best accuracy, see fig. S3). Again, because a new antigenic cluster
would need to be established before the winter season, PAV was eval-
uated in the third quarter (1 July to 30 September) right before the
coming winter season: PAV for the third quarter was linearly extrapo-
lated on the basis of the data in the previous three quarters (first and
second quarter of the current year and the fourth quarter in the previous
year, that is, from 1 October to 30 June). Specifically, on the basis of data
from the current season, if PAV increases from the first quarter to the
second quarter and crosses the selected cutoff of 0.11 for the third quar-
ter (whose value was extrapolated as explained above), an antigenic
cluster transition was identified for the upcoming season. If PAV de-
creases from the first quarter to the second quarter but is still higher
than the cutoff value of 0.11 for the third quarter (again, extrapolated),
a cluster transition will also be assigned for the upcoming season, with
the additional requirement that an antigenic cluster transition was not
already assigned for the current season. Otherwise, no cluster transition
will be anticipated for the upcoming season. With this rule and for the
data between 2002 and 2012, all antigenic cluster transitions would have
been correctly anticipated (true-positive rate equal to 1 and false-positive
rate equal to 0) with the cutoff value of PAV ranging from 0.11 to
0.2 based on the ROC analysis. The lower bound of 0.11 was applied as
the cutoff in this study to select for high sensitivity to the emergence of a
different antigenic type. The specifics of forecasting with the continuous
model are provided in the Additional description of materials and
methods in the Supplementary Materials.
Cross-validation (hindcast)
To test the predicting ability further, and specifically for different
patterns of alternating dominant subtypes in adjacent seasons, a
cross-validation analysis was conducted for the training data set itself
covering the period from 2002 to 2011. For each influenza season from
2003/2004 to 2010/2011, one at a time, the cluster model was fitted de
novo by removing the target year and using the same search strategy
than for the full data set before. With the resulting specific parameters,
a prediction was generated using the same strategy described above and
calculating the mean H1N1 incidence with all years except the target
one. In practice, the fitting of the model is implemented in MIF, with

 the parameters prevented from performing a random walk during the
window of time that contains the target year (so that the corresponding
data are not used in the filtering process) and with the likelihood eval-
uated by setting L(t) = 0 (in the log scale) in Eq. 10 below.
Statistical analyses
The resulting SIRS model was fitted to the data using MIF in the
R package pomp (67, 68). Both parameters and initial conditions
(for S, I, R, and RH1) were estimated on the basis of the likelihood
function:
LðtÞ ¼ pnormal
�
CðtÞ; φI; rI
�
ð10Þ
with C(t) > 0, where C(t) is the reported number of cases from the
model, f is the reporting rate, and r defines the SD of the measure-
ment error as proportional to the size of the infected population. If
C(t) = 0, L(t) was set to a very small value equal to −10,000 (log scale)
as a penalty. The search of parameters and initial conditions was
started with a grid of 10,000 random combinations sampled using
the Latin hypercube sampling (69) from wide ranges. This step was
followed with additional phases of increasingly localized searches.
Confidence intervals were estimated separately for each parameter
with the target parameter fixed at different values while allowing op-
timization of all other parameters also using MIF (67, 68).
AIC was used to measure goodness of a model (70). The AIC score
takes into account model complexity and penalizes the likelihood
based on the number of parameters. It was calculated here as AIC =
2k − 2 ln(L), where k is the number of parameters and L is the max-
imum likelihood. The likelihood ratio test was used for model selection
for nested models (71). Pearson’s product moment correlation was used
for all correlation analyses. Throughout the manuscript, a significance
level of 0.05 was applied.
