OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between knee
pain and function and depressive symptoms in older
Japanese adults.
DESIGN: Community-based prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Kurabuchi Town, Gumma Prefecture, Japan.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals
aged
65
and
older
(N = 573; n = 260 men, n = 313 women) without depres-
sive symptoms participated in baseline examinations in
2005 and 2006; 95.6% participated in follow-up inter-
views (2007–08).
MEASUREMENTS: Degree of knee pain and functional
impairment was assessed at baseline using a self-adminis-
tered questionnaire in Japanese based on an English ver-
sion of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
Osteoarthritis Index. The Geriatric Depression Scale was
used to identify depressive symptoms in face-to-face home-
visit interviews conducted 2 years later, and the associa-
tion between knee pain and functional impairment and
depressive symptoms was assessed using logistic regression.
RESULTS: During the 2-year follow-up, 11.9% of partici-
pants developed depressive symptoms, and pain and func-
tional impairment were found to be associated with
development of these symptoms. Pain at night while in bed
(adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.6, 95% confidence interval
(CI) = 1.4–4.9) and difficulty putting on socks (aOR = 3.7,
95%
CI:
1.8–7.5),
getting
into
and
out
of
a
car
(aOR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.8–6.5), and taking off socks
(aOR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.5–6.5) were found to be most
strongly
associated
with
development
of
depressive
symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Examining elderly people’s responses to
questions about pain at night and difficulties performing
daily activities may be an efficient way of identifying those
at high risk of developing depressive symptoms. J Am

K
nee osteoarthritis (OA) is common in middle-aged and
elderly people. It causes degeneration and destruction
of articular cartilage and surrounding joint structures,
which often limits activities of daily living (ADLs). The
global prevalence of symptomatic knee OA is reported to
be approximately 13% in women and 10% in men aged
60 and older.1 In Japan, 54.6% of people aged 40 and
older are reported to have radiographic knee OA, includ-
ing many who are asymptomatic, and the prevalence
increases with age.2 Knee OA can lead to restrictions in
ADLs,3–5 declines in quality of life,6 and subsequent detri-
ments
to
mental
health.7,8
The
relationship
between
depression
and
knee
OA
has
been
gaining
attention
recently, with some recent studies showing associations
between knee OA and development of depressive symp-
toms,9,10 but most of these studies focused on radiographic
changes rather than actual symptoms in their assessments
of knee OA. Few have examined directly how knee pain
and function relate to depressive symptom.
Depression is also a common condition in later life,
with 13.5% of people aged 55 and older reported to be
affected.11 Depressive symptoms cause a decline in physical
activity levels and everyday social and psychological func-
tion.12 Depressive symptoms in individuals with knee OA in
particular may lead to further worsening of pain symptoms
and declining physical performance.13,14 Because depression
has a strong negative effect on well-being, understanding its
risk factors is important for public health.
To determine whether knee pain and function are
associated with development of depressive symptoms, we

 analyzed data from a 2-year cohort study of older commu-
nity-dwelling Japanese adults.
METHODS
Study Population
The Kurabuchi Study is an ongoing community-based
cohort study of aging involving functional assessment of
older adults in Kurabuchi Town, Takasaki City, Gunma
Prefecture, which is located in central Japan.15 Between
2005 and 2006, all residents aged 65 and older, excluding
those who were hospitalized or institutionalized, were
enrolled (N = 1,294); 834 (64.5%) participated in detailed
health examinations (baseline survey), including assessment
of knee joint pain and function, performed at 8 commu-
nity centers. Of these, 247 participants with depressive
symptoms

(GDS5) score ≥2)16 at baseline and 14 participants on
whom we had insufficient data on knee joint pain and
function were excluded, leaving 573 participants (260
men, 313 women) for the baseline analysis. There were no
substantial demographic differences between the total eligi-
ble population and those who participated in the baseline
examinations.12,17
The ethics committees of Keio University School of
Medicine (Tokyo, Japan) (Approval No. 16–20) and Toho
University (Tokyo, Japan) approved the study protocol
(Approval No. 2700623046), and written informed con-
sent was obtained from all participants.
Baseline Examinations
A validated self-administered questionnaire in Japanese
based on an English version of the Western Ontario and
McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index18,19 was used
to assess knee pain (5 items) and functional impairment
(17 items) (Table S1). Each item was measured on a
5-point Likert scale (1–5). Pain was assessed separately in
each knee, and the score for the knee with the higher level
of pain was used as the representative value for each par-
ticipant. Pain scores ranged from 5 to 25 and functional
impairment scores from 17 to 85.
Outcome Measurements
Two years after the baseline survey in 2007 and 2008,
public health nurses and local welfare commissioners con-
ducted face-to-face home-visit interviews and evaluated
participants’ depressive symptoms using a Japanese version
of the 15-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale
(GDS15-J), one of the most useful and well-validated ques-
tionnaires for assessing depression in older populations.20
Each question on the GDS15-J elicits a yes or no response,
with 1 point allocated for each depressive symptom (yes
responses) reported (range 0–15). Participants scoring 6 or
more were defined as having depressive symptoms.21
Covariates at Baseline
Information was collected on age, sex, current smoking
status (yes vs no), current drinking status (yes vs no),
educational level (< vs ≥ high school), marital status (mar-
ried vs widowed, divorced, single), social participation
(always, often, sometimes vs no), history of life-threatening
diseases (stroke, coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus,
cancer—summary answer of yes vs no), history of rheuma-
toid arthritis (yes vs no). Body mass index (BMI) was cal-
culated as weight (kg) divided by the square of height (m)
as predicted by the demi-span,15,22 and participants were
categorized as underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight
(18.5–24.9 kg/m2), or overweight (≥25 kg/m2). Because
our previous studies had shown that vision and hearing
impairment
were
associated
with
depressive
symp-
toms,23,24 we included these as potential confounders.
Vision impairment was defined as a corrected distance
visual acuity of worse than 0.5 in the better eye, as mea-
sured using a Landolt broken ring chart at 5 m, according
to U.S. criteria.25 Hearing impairment was defined as a
score of 10 or more on the 10-item screening version of
the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly.24
Statistical Analysis
Stata version 12 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX) was
used for all data analyses.
Participants were categorized into 3 groups according
to their knee pain scores: those with no pain were included
in the “none” group, and the remaining participants were
divided at the median score into the “low” and “high”
groups. Participants were also categorized into 3 func-
tional impairment groups using the same method. Chi-
square and Fisher exact tests were used to compare the
above-mentioned baseline variables of the 3 knee pain and
3 functional impairment groups.
The relationships between the pain and functional
impairment scores and depressive symptoms were assessed
using univariate analyses and then using three multivariate
analyses using logistic regression models. Because there
was no interaction with sex, all analyses were conducted
using combined data for men and women. The first model
was adjusted for age (continuous) and sex. Model 1
included BMI, vision impairment, hearing impairment,
marital status, and history of life-threatening diseases as
covariates, in addition to age and sex. Model 2 included
the same variables as Model 1, except that participants
with a history of rheumatoid arthritis were excluded. Age,
sex, BMI, vision impairment, and hearing impairment were
considered a priori confounders, based on our previous
studies.23,24 By eliminating the question about pain at
night while in bed from the analysis, the influence of par-
ticipants who had knee pain because of depressive symp-
toms rather than osteoarthritis was evaluated. Marital
status
and
history
of
life-threatening
diseases
were
included among the covariates because they were signifi-
cantly associated with pain or functional impairment
scores in this study population. Current smoking, current
drinking, educational level, and social participation were
not included in the model, because they were not signifi-
cantly associated with knee pain scores or depressive
symptoms. Trends across the pain and functional impair-
ment score groups were also calculated by treating the
groups as an integral value. Because there were correla-
tions between participant pain and functional impairment

 categories, we did not include both categories simultane-
ously in the models. The strengths of associations were
indicated using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs), with the low group treated as the reference
group.
Finally, the association between each questionnaire
item (pain, 5 items; functional impairment, 17 items) and
depressive symptoms was assessed. For this analysis, each
item was categorized into 2 score groups (1 vs 2–5),
because few participants selected scores of 3 to 5 on the
5-point Likert scale.
RESULTS
Outcome information was collected from 548 participants
(95.6% of the 573 baseline participants), 25 did not par-
ticipate in the face-to-face home visit interviews because
13 had died, 5 had entered nursing homes or hospitals,
and 7 declined to participate. Baseline characteristics of
the participants in the 3 knee pain and 3 functional
impairment groups are shown in Table 1. The distribu-
tions
of
history
of
life-threatening
diseases
differed
between the 3 knee pain groups, and the distributions of
age, vision impairment, marital status, and history of life-
threatening diseases differed between the 3 functional
impairment groups.
During the 2 years of follow-up, 65 (11.9%) of the 548
participants developed depressive symptoms. The univariate
and adjusted ORs (aORs) of developing depressive symp-
toms according to pain and functional impairment scores
are shown in Table 2. Pain and functional impairment
scores were associated with development of depressive
symptoms. In Model 1, individuals with low (aOR = 2.1,
95% CI = 1.0–4.0) and high (aOR = 2.0, 95% CI = 0.9–
4.4) pain scores were twice as likely to develop depressive
symptoms as those with no pain. Individuals with low func-
tional impairment scores were 60% more likely to develop
depressive symptoms (aOR = 1.6, 95% CI = 0.8–3.3), and
those with high functional impairment scores were 3.6 times
as likely (aOR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.7–7.6). The risk to
develop depressive symptoms increased by 50% as each pain
category increased (aOR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0–2.2), and
almost
twice
as
each
functional
category
increased
(aOR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.3–2.7) as likely. Excluding partici-
pants with rheumatoid arthritis (Model 2) did not change
the associations substantially. In addition, when the ques-
tion about pain at night while in bed was excluded from the
analysis, the positive association between pain score and
development of depressive symptoms remained significant
(Table S2).
Table 3 shows aORs of developing depressive symp-
toms for each item on the questionnaire. Point estimates
were above unity for all items. Of the questions on knee
pain, the report of pain at night while in bed was most
strongly associated with depressive symptoms (Model 1:
OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.4–4.9), and of the questions on the
functional impairment, pain while putting on socks (aOR
3.7, 95% CI 1.8–7.5), getting into and out of a car (aOR
3.4, 95% CI 1.8–6.5), taking off socks (aOR 3.1, 95% CI
1.5–6.5), and getting into and out of the bath (aOR 3.1,
95% CI 1.5–6.5) were most strongly associated with
depressive symptoms (Model 1).

 DISCUSSION
The present community-based 2-year cohort study revealed
that older people with pain and functional impairment of
the knee joint have a greater risk of developing depressive
symptoms than those without. Assessment of each question
on the questionnaires showed that most were associated
with depressive symptoms even after adjusting for covari-
ates. Unlike previous studies, ours did not rely on changes
in radiographic images but rather focused on actual pain
and function. This study broadly assessed not only OA but
also what bearing knee pain and function had on the
development of depressive symptoms.
Of the pain questionnaire items, pain at night while in
bed was associated most strongly with development of
depressive
symptoms
(aOR = 2.6,
95%
CI = 1.4–4.9).
People who experience severe pain even at rest are in the
severest stage of knee OA, and those with pain at night
would also be expected to experience pain in almost any
daily activity, in addition to probably not being able to get
enough sleep at night. For such people, the development of
depressive symptoms is unsurprising. As for the functional
impairment
questionnaire
items,
putting
on
socks
(aOR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.8–7.5), getting into and out of a
car (aOR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.8–6.5), and taking off socks
(aOR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.8–6.6) were most strongly associ-
ated with development of depressive symptoms. These 3
activities are relate to going out, which suggests that
elderly people are likely to become depressed when going
out starts to become a physical burden for them. Forced
withdrawal from a socially active life is an understandable
cause of depression, and interventions to keep people
socially active may be effective in preventing them from
becoming depressed.
The questionnaire we used is a useful tool to diagnose
OA, including in the very early stages, and it also helps
determine the severity of synovitis, which is an important
finding in knee OA.19,26,27 Thanks to this questionnaire,
we believe we were able to obtain a reasonable assessment
of the extent of OA in each participant, including those in
the very early stages and those who would not have shown
changes on radiographic imaging.
Alternatively, because we did not check any radio-
graphic images or the actual knee function of each partici-
pant, there is a possibility that other joint diseases caused
the symptoms we observed in some cases (e.g., rheumatic
diseases, old injuries) or that they had psychogenic causes
or reflected other diseases (e.g., lumber canal stenosis, dia-
betes mellitus).28,29 Some studies have indicated that indi-
viduals with depression are at higher risk of developing
knee pain30 and that knee pain may be a manifestation of
depression.31 Of the questions we asked, depression was
most likely to cause pain at night, although the positive
association between pain and depression remained even
when we excluded the question about pain at night while
in bed from the analysis. We must also acknowledge that
we evaluated depressive symptoms only on the basis of
questionnaire results and obtained no clinical diagnoses of
depression.
There are two other limitations in our study. One is
that we did not ask about prior history of depression in
our baseline survey, so it is possible that we could not
exclude participants who did not have depressive symp-
tom at baseline but had a history of depression in the
past. These participants might also have a greater risk
of developing depressive symptoms. Another limitation is
that the results may in some ways reflect the lifestyles of
Japanese people. For example, many Japanese sleep on
futons rather than beds. Therefore, caution should be
exercised in generalizing our results to clinical situations
or to other ethnic groups.
Major depressive disorder and knee OA are prevalent
in elderly people, and they can form a vicious cycle.32
Early intervention is necessary to maintain appropriate
daily activity levels in elderly people. Our findings indicate
that the possibility that the individual also has depressive
symptoms should be considered when treating or manag-
ing knee OA in older adults, especially those with pain. In
particular, asking them whether they experience pain at
night or have difficulty performing daily activities such as
putting on and taking off socks or getting into and out of
cars may be a useful way in busy outpatient clinics to
identify those at risk of developing depressive symptoms.
