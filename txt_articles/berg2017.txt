IMPORTANCE Early-life epilepsies are often a consequence of numerous neurodevelopmental
disorders, most of which are proving to have genetic origins. The role of genetic testing in the
initial evaluation of these epilepsies is not established.
OBJECTIVE To provide a contemporary account of the patterns of use and diagnostic yield of
genetic testing for early-life epilepsies.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this prospective cohort, children with newly
diagnosed epilepsy with an onset at less than 3 years of age were recruited from March 1,
2012, to April 30, 2015, from 17 US pediatric hospitals and followed up for 1 year. Of 795
families approached, 775 agreed to participate. Clinical diagnosis of the etiology of epilepsy
were characterized based on information available before genetic testing was performed.
Added contributions of cytogenetic and gene sequencing investigations were determined.
EXPOSURES Genetic diagnostic testing.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Laboratory-confirmed pathogenic variant.
RESULTS Of the 775 patients in the study (367 girls and 408 boys; median age of onset, 7.5
months [interquartile range, 4.2-16.5 months]), 95 (12.3%) had acquired brain injuries. Of the
remaining 680 patients, 327 (48.1%) underwent various forms of genetic testing, which
identified pathogenic variants in 132 of 327 children (40.4%; 95% CI, 37%-44%): 26 of 59
(44.1%) with karyotyping, 32 of 188 (17.0%) with microarrays, 31 of 114 (27.2%) with epilepsy
panels, 11 of 33 (33.3%) with whole exomes, 4 of 20 (20.0%) with mitochondrial panels, and
28 of 94 (29.8%) with other tests. Forty-four variants were identified before initial epilepsy
presentation. Apart from dysmorphic syndromes, pathogenic yields were highest for children
with tuberous sclerosis complex (9 of 11 [81.8%]), metabolic diseases (11 of 14 [78.6%]), and
brain malformations (20 of 61 [32.8%]). A total of 180 of 446 children (40.4%), whose
etiology would have remained unknown without genetic testing, underwent some testing.
Pathogenic variants were identified in 48 of 180 children (26.7%; 95% CI, 18%-34%).
Diagnostic yields were greater than 15% regardless of delay, spasms, and young age. Yields
were greater for epilepsy panels (28 of 96 [29.2%]; P < .001) and whole exomes (5 of 18
[27.8%]; P = .02) than for chromosomal microarray (8 of 101 [7.9%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Genetic investigations, particularly broad sequencing
methods, have high diagnostic yields in newly diagnosed early-life epilepsies regardless of
key clinical features. Thorough genetic investigation emphasizing sequencing tests should be
incorporated into the initial evaluation of newly presenting early-life epilepsies and not just
reserved for those with severe presentations and poor outcomes.

first 3 years of life.1 Early-life epilepsies (ELEs) repre-
sent many diverse diseases, often with devastating and
lasting consequences. Previously, most ELEs were relegated
to the undifferentiated category of symptomatic (sometimes
“secondary”or“catastrophic”)generalizedepilepsy,withafew
rare electroclinical syndromes (eg, West syndrome or infan-
tile spasms) specifically recognized.2-10 Causes in half or more
of the patients remain unknown.
Neuroimaging and, particularly, genetic diagnostic tech-
nologies have advanced rapidly in the last 20 years and may
provide a basis for disease-targeted therapies. Although neu-
roimaging is the standard of care in the initial evaluation of
ELEs,11-13 genetic testing has never been recommended for
evaluation of ELEs, especially in the initial diagnostic workup.
This practice continues despite a growing literature directed
at gene discovery for ELE,14,15 which has used individual tech-
niques such as whole-exome sequencing (WES),14,16,17 chro-
mosome microarray (CMA),18 epilepsy panels,19,20 and single-
gene testing21-25 for highly selected patients. None, however,
addresses the value of genetic testing as a primary diagnostic
technology at the outset of the disorder.
We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study
to provide a contemporary account of the clinical epidemiol-
ogy of newly diagnosed ELE as evaluated in US pediatric epi-
lepsy centers. We examined the use and yield of genetic test-
ing performed at and during the year after initial diagnosis and
its contributions to elucidating the etiology of ELE.

Data collection targeted the diagnostic evaluation (neu-
roimaging, metabolic, and genetic), diagnoses of etiology, epi-
lepsy syndrome, and history and results of examination. Data
from before epilepsy diagnosis and through 1 year after initial
diagnosis were used to determine underlying etiology.
Data were reviewed by site investigators and entered into
a Research Electronic Data Capture database.26 Based on his-
tory and results of clinical examinations, neuroimaging, and
metabolic testing, etiology was categorized as acquired brain
injuries (ie, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, intraventricu-
lar hemorrhage, stroke, trauma, and infections), focal corti-
caldysplasia,otherbrainmalformationsandabnormalities(eg,
lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, and septo-optic dysplasia), tu-
berous sclerosis complex, other neurocutaneous diseases,
metabolic diseases, recognizable dysmorphic syndromes (eg,
Down syndrome and Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome), and other
disorders (eg, tumors). Microcephaly without specific struc-
tural abnormality was considered a brain malformation. When
etiology could not be assigned to one of these categories, it was
considered “unexplained.” The unexplained group was fur-
ther divided into those with normal developmental status (in-
cluding mild or equivocal delays) and those with developmen-
tal delay based on the clinician’
s report from the examination
and history initially and during the year after diagnosis.
The use and yield of genetic testing in each category for
etiology were determined based on results of all testing per-
formed before, at, and during the year immediately following
initial epilepsy diagnosis. Genetic testing included tests gen-
erating cytogenetic, copy number, or DNA sequencing data.
Metabolic testing and clinical examinations, while used in ge-
netic diagnosis, were not considered to be genetic testing for
these purposes. All testing was for clinical purposes and based
on the discretion of the treating clinician. Variants were re-
viewed in light of current information by 2 of us (a board-
certified clinical cytogeneticist [M.K.] and a board-certified
clinical molecular geneticist [J.J.A.]). When warranted, inter-
pretations were updated. Patterns of use and yield of genetic
testingwerespecificallyexaminedinchildrenwithinitiallyun-
explained etiology with respect to age at onset, presence of in-
fantile spasms, and developmental delay.
Analyses were performed in SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Insti-
tute). Bivariate analyses were performed in PROC
SURVEYFREQ27 and multivariable logistic regression analy-
ses in PROC GLIMMIX28 to adjust for clustering of observa-
tions by center treated as a random variable. Confidence in-
tervals were constructed with standard errors that incorporate
clustering of patients by site. P < .05 was the minimal level ac-
cepted as reflecting statistical significance.
Key Points
Question What is the diagnostic yield of genetic testing when
used for children with newly presenting early-life epilepsy?
Finding In this cohort study of 775 children, diagnostic yields
overall were 40%, with epilepsy gene-sequencing panels and
whole-exome sequencing having substantially greater diagnostic
yields than chromosomal microarray. In the absence of a clinically
identified cause, testing yields were greater than 15% and as high
as 47% depending on patient subgroups.
Meaning Genetic testing, especially with sequencing-based
methods, should be incorporated into the routine initial evaluation
of early-life epilepsy.

 Results
Twenty families declined participation, and 775 eligible chil-
dren were recruited (367 girls and 408 boys). The number of
children per site varied from 4 to 131 (median, 31). The me-
dianageatonsetofepilepsywas7.5months(interquartilerange
[IQR], 4.2-16.5 months), and the median age at diagnosis was
8.7 months (IQR, 5.0-19.2 months). Onset occurred at less than
12 months of age in 509 children (65.7%), 12 to 23 months of
age in 151 children (19.5%), and 24 to 35 months of age in 115
children (14.8%).
Within 1 year of initial presentation with epilepsy, 272 chil-
dren(35.1%)werediagnosedwithinfantilespasms(spasms),63
(8.1%) had other specific electroclinical diagnoses, and 440
(56.8%)hadnonsyndromicepilepsypresentations.Theelectro-
clinicaldiagnoseswereDravetsyndrome(n = 11);myoclonicepi-
lepsy of infancy (n = 9); myoclonic-atonic (astatic) epilepsy
(n = 6);febrileseizures-plus(n = 5);Ohtaharasyndrome,benign
epilepsyofinfancy,benignfamilialinfantileepilepsy,andabsence
epilepsy (n = 4 each); benign familial neonatal epilepsy, early
myoclonicencephalopathy,andepilepsywithmyoclonicabsence
(n = 3 each); malignant migrating focal seizures in infancy and
Lennox-Gastautsyndrome(n = 2each);andmyoclonicepilepsy
withnonprogressivedisorders,benignepilepsywithcentrotem-
poralspikes,andgelasticseizureswithhypothalamichamartoma
(n = 1each).Thirty-fourchildrenwithinitiallynonsyndromicpre-
sentations evolved to spasms, and 2 with spasms evolved to
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. All 36 are counted only once in the
spasms group.
Evaluations and Findings
Neuroimaging
Overall, 620 children (80.0%) underwent epilepsy protocol
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)11 at initial evaluation
(n = 534)orwithintheyearfollowing(n = 86).Ninety-fourchil-
dren (12.1%) underwent nonepilepsy protocol MRI, 11 chil-
dren (1.4%) underwent computed tomographic scans or ul-
trasonography, and 50 children (6.5%) had no imaging
performed during the study. For all 725 neuroimaging studies
combined, 273 (37.7%) yielded findings that either provided
a specific diagnosis (eg, lissencephaly or tumor) or indicated
a developmental or progressive brain disorder.
Metabolic Testing
Various metabolic tests were performed for 384 children
(49.5%), including tests of blood (359 [46.3%]), urine (244
[31.5%]), and cerebral spinal fluid (133 [17.2%]). Sixteen chil-
dren received a diagnosis of the following metabolic dis-
eases: Leigh syndrome (n = 4), nonketotic hyperglycinemia
(n = 3), Zellweger syndrome (n = 2), mitochondrial diseases
(n = 2), and 1 child each of methylmalonic acidemia, vitamin
B12dependency,pyruvatedehydrogenasedeficiency,GM1gan-
gliosidosis, and Alper-Huttenlocher disease.
Initial Etiology Assignment Before Genetic Testing
Based on history and results of clinical examinations, neuro-
imaging, and metabolic testing, the initial etiology assign-
ments were acquired brain injuries (n = 95), focal cortical dys-
plasia (n = 21), other brain malformations and abnormalities
(n = 91), tuberous sclerosis complex (n = 20), other neurocu-
taneous disorders (n = 12), metabolic diseases (n = 16), dys-
morphic syndromes (n = 45), other disorders (n = 29), unex-
plained with developmental delay (n = 122), and unexplained
with normal development (n = 324).
Genetic Testing
To target children in whom neurogenetic factors might play
an explanatory role, analyses focused on children without
documented acquired brain injury (n = 680). Of these chil-
dren, 327 (48.1%) underwent some genetic testing: 94 before
initial epilepsy evaluations, 171 during initial evaluations, and
135 during the following year. Sixty children underwent test-
ing at multiple time points.
At the time of initial evaluations, 44 children already had
the following laboratory-confirmed genetic diagnoses: tri-
somy 21 (n = 18), other trisomies and tetrasomies (n = 4), chro-
mosomal deletions or duplications of varying sizes detected
by karyotyping or CMA (n = 14), and single- or multiple-
nucleotidevariantsidentifiedthroughsequencing(n = 8).Test-
ing as part of the epilepsy evaluation (through 1 year) identi-
fied explanatory pathogenic variants in 88 more children for
a total of 132 (40.4%), including 4 with variants of uncertain
significance reclassified as pathogenic (Figure 1; eTable in the
Supplement).
Ten children were carriers for autosomal recessive disor-
ders, which corresponded to their clinical diagnoses in 2 chil-
dren. The first child had frontally predominant lissencephaly
with cerebellar hypoplasia associated with a heterozygous
pathogenic RELN (OMIM 600514) mutation (eFigure in the
Supplement). The second child was clinically diagnosed with
Leigh syndrome and had a heterozygous pathogenic variant
of NDUFAF5 (OMIM 612360). Sixty-six other children had vari-
ants of uncertain significance in potentially relevant genes.
Twenty children had clinical genetic diagnoses that were not
confirmed through genetic testing (3 also had a variant of un-
certain significance): 7 with Down syndrome, 11 with tuber-
ous sclerosis complex, 1 with neurofibromatosis, and 1 with
Kabuki syndrome.
Chromosomal microarray was the most commonly used
test (n = 188), followed by a sequencing-based epilepsy gene
panel (n = 114), karyotypes (n = 59), WES (n = 33), mitochon-
drial gene tests (nuclear and mitochondrial; n = 20), and vari-
ous disease-targeted tests (n = 94; eg, for tuberous sclerosis
complex or lissencephaly). The proportion of children tested
varied among the 17 sites (median, 49% [IQR, 40%-62%]).
When genetic testing was performed, the median pathogenic
yield across centers was 40% (IQR, 36%-45%).
Diagnostic (pathogenic) yields from each type of test were
meaningfully high. For the 3 broad tests, the yields were as fol-
lows: 32 of 188 children for CMA (17.0%; 95% CI, 11%-23%), 31
of 114 children for epilepsy panels (27.2%; 95% CI, 17%-38%),
and 11 of 33 children for WES (33.3%; 95% CI, 16%-51%). Vari-
ants of unknown significance and heterozygous mutation in
autosomal recessive genes were found for all test types
(Figure 2). Of 22 patients with both CMA and WES, 8 of 21

WES, whereas the results of WES were negative and the re-
sults of CMA were diagnostic for 1 patient. Similarly, of 44 chil-

 following (n = 93) their initial epilepsy evaluation (35 had test-
ing at multiple times). Pathogenic variants were reported in 48
of 180 patients tested (26.7%; 95% CI, 18%-34%). Chromo-
some microarray yields (8 of 101 [7.9%]; 95% CI, 0%-16%) were
markedly lower than yields for panels (28 of 96 [29.2%]; 95%
CI, 17%-42%; P < .001) and for WES (5 of 18 [27.8%]; 95% CI,
3%-52%; P = .02). Yields for these tests did not vary mark-
edly by developmental delay (Figure 3). Pathogenic variants
were identified before (n = 4 [all developmentally delayed]),
during (n = 18), and in the year immediately following (n = 26)
initial epilepsy evaluations.
Genetic testing was ordered 2 to 3 times as often for infants
(<1 year) than for older patients, for those with vs without defi-
nitedevelopmentaldelay,andforthosewithspasmsinitiallyand

tothelikelihoodofbeingtested.Onbivariateanalysis,diagnos-
tic yields did not significantly differ by age at onset or develop-
mental delay but were substantially lower overall for children
with spasms and especially when limited to infants. Because
spasms are strongly associated with delays and early age at on-
set, all 3 factors were strongly associated with pathogenic test
results in a multivariable model.
Discussion
Our results provide a contemporary assessment of the use of
genetic testing in US pediatric epilepsy centers and its diag-
nostic value for children with newly presenting ELE. Whereas
most studies focus on genetic testing in convenience samples
of patients selected for severe presentations and outcomes, we
targeted all eligible patients at participating centers with ELE
at initial diagnostic presentation. After excluding children with
acquired brain injuries, the precipitating etiology could be
linked to a specific genetic factor in 40% of children, includ-
ingthosewithbrainmalformations,metabolicdiseases,ordys-
morphic syndromes. Genetic testing provided a diagnosis in
one-fourth of children whose cause would have otherwise re-
mained unresolved.
Magneticresonanceimagingisrecommendedintheevalu-
ation of ELE,11-13 and there was a high use of neuroimaging (725
of 775 [93.5%]), mostly with MRI (714 of 775 [92.1%]). Conse-
quently, most brain malformations in this cohort have likely
been identified, although some subtle focal cortical dyspla-
sias may not be discernible until myelination is more com-
plete.Recentinternationalrecommendationsemphasizemeta-

 which were then confirmed by genetic testing. This same re-
port recommended genetic testing only for selected children
“as the screening to identify those in need of specific genetic
analysis is based on tertiary settings.
”29(p1188) Although know-
ing how to use genetic investigations, interpret findings, and
report results and the availability of appropriate genetic coun-
seling are critical, we found that, like neuroimaging, current
clinical genetic testing methods have substantial diagnostic
yields regardless of clinical features certainly higher than the
many metabolic tests that are frequently ordered. These re-
sults suggest that genetic testing should be incorporated into
the routine initial evaluation of ELEs to reach an accurate di-
agnosis as soon as possible.
To our knowledge, CMA is currently the only test with a
tangentially relevant indication, unexplained developmental
delays.30,31 For children with initially unexplained etiology,
however, the yield of CMA was substantially less than for se-
quencing methods (panels and WES). Thus, prioritizing se-
quencing-based tests over CMA may be a more efficient diag-
nostic strategy for children with normal results of imaging and
noninformative histories regardless of developmental status.
Whether WES or epilepsy gene panels are comparably effi-
cient is unclear. Currently, WES is more expensive because it
requires trios and extensive genetic counseling. Its sensitiv-
ity is also variable due to inadequate coverage of some
genes.32-34 As genetic testing technologies rapidly evolve, the
relative costs and benefits of current and future technologies
will likely change as well. Whole-genome sequencing, which
can detect variants ranging in size from a single-nucleotide
changethroughlargechromosomalvariants,mayreplacemany
of the current testing technologies in the future.
Our findings highlight the difficulties in characterizing the
etiologyofdevelopmentalbraindisorders.Traditionaldivisions
of structural, metabolic, and genetic seem increasingly
inadequate35 because many brain malformations36 and inborn
metabolic diseases37 are fundamentally genetic. The genetic-
structuraldistinctionisfurtherchallengedbyobservationsthat
ionchannelopathies,thequintessential“genetic”epilepsy,can
beassociatedwithstrikingabnormalitiesinbrainstructure.23,38
Althoughresultsofgenetictestingwerenegativeforchildrenwith
focal cortical dysplasias, these lesions are often due to somatic
mutations that may only be detectable through very deep se-
quencing of testing of brain tissue–derived DNA.39,40 In the fu-
ture,therapiesmaybedirectedtowardmolecularpathwaysand

 Limitations
Important limitations of this study include that it is not popu-
lation-based; there may be a selection of patients sent to hospi-
tal centers according to severity at initial presentation. Patients
were not further selected, however, and they represent newly
presentingpatientsinitiallydiagnosedatthesecenters.Giventhat
participating hospitals are located across the United States and
servediversecommunities,wesuspectthatourfindingsarerel-
evanttoothercentersinthiscountryorelsewhere.Theydonot,
however, reflect non–hospital-based practice.
Data come from review of medical records, and pediatric
epileptologists at each site ensured the quality of the re-
corded data elements. Genetic testing reports, however, were
not always available for review, especially when testing oc-
curred before epilepsy presentation. In those instances, the
variants in the medical record, as reported and used by the
treating clinicians, were accepted.
Children did not undergo systematic genetic testing, al-
though all tests were performed at Clinical Laboratory Im-
provement Amendments–certified facilities. Tests were or-
dered by physicians at their discretion. Consequently, there
were expected trends in the use of genetic testing by key clini-
cal features. Diagnostic yields, however, were meaningfully
high regardless of these features, although they were low for
spasms. Ideally, all children should receive the same thor-
ough, comprehensive test battery.
Expanding comprehensive genetic testing to all children
with ELE could yield many benefits, including stratification
of patients in trials of disease-targeted therapies.41 Currently,
there is little evidence to guide selection of therapies based on
genetic diagnosis; most recommendations reflect expert opin-
ion (eg, for Dravet syndrome,42 largely due to SCN1A [OMIM
182389] variants) and anecdotes (eg, for KCNQ2 [OMIM
602235]-associated43 and SCN2A [OMIM 182390]-associated
epilepsies44); in our study, there were 12 children with SCN1A
variants, 2 children with KCNQ2-associated epilepsies, and no
children with SCN2A-associated epilepsies. The lack of evi-
dence to guide treatment based on genetic diagnosis occurs
because the individual genetic disorders are rare and cur-
rently not routinely identified due to an uneven and some-
times unenthusiastic uptake of genetic testing.45,46 If testing
is not performed and genetic diagnoses are not made, there is
no basis for identifying optimal, targeted treatments. Priori-
tizing thorough, comprehensive genetic testing as part of the
initial epilepsy evaluation could make precision medicine part
of standard clinical practice. Ideally, the inclusion of genetic
testingwouldresultinbetterhealthoutcomesandreducecosts
due to overuse of unnecessary but currently reimbursed di-
agnostic modalities,47 including metabolic testing.48
Aside from treatment selection, multiple benefits accrue
to the health system and the family by obtaining a genetic
diagnosis.49 It ends the diagnostic odyssey during which par-
ents and physicians spend untold amounts of time searching
for an explanation for a child’
s epilepsy50 and reduces associ-
ated costs.47 A genetic diagnosis allows for genetic counsel-
ing of parents who may wish to have more children and the
consideration of risk for other siblings once they are ready to
plan families.51 A genetic diagnosis creates the opportunity to
participate in research studies of new therapies and to find op-
timal therapy and management approaches for the child or for
others in the future. The most successful rare disease net-
work, Children’
s Oncology Group,52 has been effective in turn-
ingclinicalcareintoresearchandfeedingresultsbackintocare,
continuously improving survivorship and other outcomes of
young patients with cancer. Finally, a genetic diagnosis al-
lows families to seek out others and advocate for research into
these rare conditions through a variety of channels, such as
the National Organization for Rare Disorders.53
Conclusions
Growing evidence suggests that early, effective intervention
for seizures may modify the severity of developmental, be-
havioral, and other outcomes for children with ELE.54-56 This
evidence provides added impetus to move the diagnosis of the
specificcausetothepointofinitialpresentation.Ourstudypro-
vides an initial assessment of the potential diagnostic value
of such a strategy and suggests that it is time to provide greater
emphasisonandsupportforthoroughgeneticevaluations,par-
ticularlysequencing-basedevaluations,forchildrenwithnewly
presenting epilepsies in the first few years of life.
