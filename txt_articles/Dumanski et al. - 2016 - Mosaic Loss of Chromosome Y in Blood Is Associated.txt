Men have a shorter life expectancy compared with women but the underlying factor(s) are not clear. Late-onset, sporadic Alzheimer
disease (AD) is a common and lethal neurodegenerative disorder and many germline inherited variants have been found to influence
the risk of developing AD. Our previous results show that a fundamentally different genetic variant, i.e., lifetime-acquired loss of chro-
mosome Y (LOY) in blood cells, is associated with all-cause mortality and an increased risk of non-hematological tumors and that LOY
could be induced by tobacco smoking. We tested here a hypothesis that men with LOYare more susceptible to AD and show that LOY is
associated with AD in three independent studies of different types. In a case-control study, males with AD diagnosis had higher degree of
LOY mosaicism (adjusted odds ratio ¼ 2.80, p ¼ 0.0184, AD events ¼ 606). Furthermore, in two prospective studies, men with LOY
at blood sampling had greater risk for incident AD diagnosis during follow-up time (hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 6.80, 95% confidence interval
[95% CI] ¼ 2.16–21.43, AD events ¼ 140, p ¼ 0.0011). Thus, LOY in blood is associated with risks of both AD and cancer, suggesting a
role of LOY in blood cells on disease processes in other tissues, possibly via defective immunosurveillance. As a male-specific risk factor,
LOY might explain why males on average live shorter lives than females.
Introduction
Alzheimer disease (AD [MIM: 104300]) is the most com-
mon neurodegenerative disorder and constitutes a major
public health problem worldwide. Its etiology is complex
and several pathways probably contribute to the pathol-
ogy. The delineation of each pathophysiological pathway
and identification of the factors that modulate the clinical
phenotypes are crucial for the development of effective
treatments and improved definitions of at-risk groups.
The identification of genes involved in early-onset mono-
genic forms of AD has significantly contributed to our
knowledge of the disease mechanisms.1 The causal links
between mutations, the functions of the mutated genes,
and disease development prompted a hypothesis radically
changing understanding of AD; i.e., the amyloid cascade
hypothesis.2 However, most cases of AD present a sporadic
and late-onset form of disease. Thus, we need to further
characterize the etiology of AD and understanding the
genetics of the disease appears to be one of the best ways
forward, as has been the case for monogenic forms of
AD. Indeed, it has been estimated that genetic risk factors
account for up to 80% of the attributable risk for AD3
and one can thus argue that the majority of the AD patho-
physiology is driven by or include genetic factors. In addi-
tion to APOE (MIM: 107741), which is the major genetic
determinant of AD,4 the advent of genomic approaches
(e.g., SNP-based genome-wide association studies [GWASs]
and next-generation sequencing) has now led to the
characterization of more than 25 genetic risk variants.5–9
These implicate pathways related to immune response,
regulation
of
endocytosis,
cholesterol
transport,
and
protein ubiquitination.10 However, less than 50% of the
genetic risk for AD has been characterized so far. It is also
noteworthy that although SNPs have been extensively
studied in AD, only a restricted number of reports have
assessed the association of structural genetic variations
with AD risk.11
The field of human genetics is increasingly recognizing
that genetic variation acquired during life (i.e., post-
zygotic changes) is not sufficiently explored. This is valid
for both the extent of detectable post-zygotic variants at
various ages and in different tissues as well as their impor-
tance for variety of human phenotypes and diseases.12 The
major insight over the past few years has been discoveries
of frequent aberrant clonal expansions (ACEs) in periph-
eral blood cells from apparently disease-free subjects.
It has now been thoroughly described that ACEs often
carry various post-zygotic genetic alterations, the majority
of which affect gene dosage of chromosomal segments
and/or mutations in specific genes that are connected
with cancer development.13–18 Thus, ACEs represent po-
tential pre-cancerous changes and a clear association of
ACEs with increasing age in humans has also been shown.

 In agreement with the above, reports have shown strong
associations of ACEs with cancer mortality and cancer di-
agnoses, both non-hematological and hematological.14–17
Furthermore, associations between ACEs and non-cancer
related outcomes, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascu-
lar disease, have also been shown.17,19 This might suggest
the importance of ACEs for conditions outside the cancer
field and further emphasize possible effects of ACEs detect-
able in blood on disease processes in other tissues, i.e.,
outside the hematopoietic system.
Chromosome Y is recognized for its role in sex determi-
nation and normal sperm production, but it has long been
considered as genetic wasteland and its characterization
has lagged behind that of the rest of the genome.20,21
Furthermore, it has been known for more than 50 years,
from the earliest cytogenetic analyses, that mosaic loss of
chromosome Y (LOY) is frequent among aging men.22,23
However, the phenotypic consequences of LOY have
been elusive and the prevailing consensus has been that
it should be considered phenotypically neutral and related
to normal aging.24–29 The recent molecular analyses
suggest that mosaic LOY in normal blood samples can be
detected in R10% of blood cells in at least 15% of males
around and above 70 years of age.30,31 Thus, normal
blood cells with nullisomy Y represent an ACE, which is
detectable because cell clones without chromosome Y are
enriched, possibly due to an increased proliferative poten-
tial. Moreover, other analyses of various cancers indicate
that chromosome Y is lost in many types of tumors in
frequencies ranging from 15% to 80% of cases.32–35 Thus,
combined results on LOY in non-cancerous blood clones
and in transformed tumor cells suggest that nullisomy Y
is the most common human mutation, and it affects
~1.6% of the genome.
Recent analyses using two independent cohorts (ULSAM
and PIVUS) showed an association between LOY in blood
and risk for all-cause mortality as well as for cancer outside
the hematopoietic system. Both of these cohorts are also
included in the current study. The median survival time
among men with LOY was 5.5 years shorter and about
half as long when compared to those without LOY,30
which suggests that LOY in blood could become a pre-
dictive biomarker of male carcinogenesis. It was further
demonstrated that smoking is associated with LOY in
blood cells in three independent cohorts. The finding
that smoking can induce LOY thus links a very common
and preventable environmental risk factor with the most
common human mutation.31 The above-mentioned re-
sults regarding LOY and cancer risk have recently been
extended to several specific cancer diagnoses.36,37 It should
also be mentioned that LOY has been suggested to be
involved in the pathogenesis of rare autoimmune diseases
in males, such as autoimmune thyroiditis and primary
biliary cirrhosis, which points to a possible functional
connection between LOY and dysfunction of the im-
mune system.38,39 Here we tested the hypothesis that
aging males with mosaic LOY are also more susceptible
to develop other common diseases, concentrating on
Alzheimer disease, using three independent studies of
different types: two prospective investigations and a case-
control study.
Materials and Methods
Studied Cohorts
The EADI1 case-control study (European Alzheimer’s Disease
Initiative stage 1) was collected specifically for research on AD
and first described in Lambert et al.40 Controls for this investiga-
tion were selected from the 3C Study,41 which is a population-
based study of the relationship between vascular factors and
dementia. It has been carried out in three French cities: Bordeaux,
Montpellier,
and
Dijon. A
sample of
non-institutionalized,
65 years old or older subjects was randomly selected from the elec-
toral rolls of each city. The second cohort was Uppsala Longitudi-
nal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM), which started in 1970–1974,
when all 50-year-old men living in Uppsala County, Sweden,
were invited to a health survey, initially focusing at identifying
risk factors for cardiovascular disease.42 Out of a total of 2,841
men born in 1920–1924, 2,322 (82%) agreed to participate in
the study. Since then, the cohort has been reinvestigated several
times at ages 60, 70 (when the first blood samples for DNA
extraction were collected), 77, 82, 88, 91, and 93 years. The third
cohort was PIVUS (Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in
Uppsala Seniors), which started in 2001 with the primary aim of
investigating the predictive power of various measurements of
endothelial function and arterial compliance. Eligible participants
were all aged 70 and were living in the community of Uppsala,
Sweden. The subjects were randomly chosen from the community
register, and 1,016 men and women participated. Two reinvestiga-
tions of the cohort were undertaken, starting in the spring of 2006
and in the spring of 2011 at the ages of 75 and 80 years, respec-
tively.43 The number of subjects included in statistical analyses
from all three cohorts and the confounding factors at baseline
are shown in Table S1. All procedures were in accordance with
the standards of the responsible local research ethics committees
on human experimentation and proper informed consents were
obtained.
Assessment of Dementia Status
We included participants only from clinical analyses performed
with the highest possible standards and confidence of AD diag-
noses. In the EADI1 cohort, AD cases were ascertained by neurol-
ogists from Bordeaux, Dijon, Lille, Montpellier, Paris, and Rouen.
In the ULSAM and PIVUS cohorts, the AD diagnoses were assigned
by experienced geriatricians at the Memory Clinic, Uppsala Uni-
versity Hospital. In all cohorts, AD was diagnosed according to
the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Dis-
eases and Stroke and the AD and Related Disorders Association
criteria.44
Estimation of LOY from SNP-Array Data
All participants were genotyped using different versions of
Illumina SNP arrays and we applied a strict quality criterion as
described in the Results. A continuous variable, the median of
the log R ratio (i.e., mLRRY), was used to estimate the degree of
LOY for each subject and calculated as the median value of the
SNP-array probes positioned within the male-specific region of
The American Journal of Human Genetics 98, 1208–1219, June 2, 2016
1209
 chromosome Y (i.e., MSY, chrY: 2,694,521–59,034,049, hg19/
GRCh37) as described.30 The ULSAM samples were genotyped
with the Illumina HumanOmni2.5M chip, the PIVUS samples
with the Illumina HumanOmniExpress chip, and the EADI1 sam-
ples with the Illumina Human610Quad chip, containing 2,560,
1,690, and 2,153 SNP probes located within the MSY, respectively.
An mLRRY value close to zero indicates a normal chromosome Y
state and more negative mLRRY values indicate increasing degree
of LOY mosaicism.
Normalization of mLRRY Distributions and LOY
Scoring with a 99% Confidence Limit
There was a systematic bias in the log R ratio data of chromosome
Y from all cohorts with a median intensity of mLRRY distributions
shifted slightly away from zero. To facilitate comparisons among
the three included studies, we performed a correction of the bias
by using cohort-specific correction constants, as described previ-
ously.30,31 In brief, local regression medians were calculated from
the mLRRY distributions from each cohort and used to adjust
mLRRY values from every participant. This step generated compa-
rable mLRRY distributions from the three studied cohorts with
medians at zero. Furthermore, to estimate the frequency of LOY
in the three studied populations and to group participants for
plotting results, we scored participants as affected with LOY or
not (1/0) using the lower limit of the 99% confidence interval of
the experimentally induced variation of the mLRRY distribution
for each cohort separately, as described previously for ULSAM
and PIVUS30,31 and in Figure S1 for the EADI1 study.
Validation of LOY via Next-Generation Whole-
Genome Sequencing
In 100 ULSAM subjects, observations of LOY as well as other auto-
somal mosaic copy-number variants detected by SNP array were
validated using low-coverage (~53) WGS data, as described previ-
ously.30 A similar validation approach was applied for EADI1
study. Whole-genome sequences from 183 subjects were gener-
ated with the Illumina HiSeq platform of the McGill University
and Ge
´nome Que
´bec Innovation Center with paired-end reads
of 125 base pairs at a mean depth of 303. Sequencing reads were
aligned to the GRCh37 human reference genome with BWA
software45 using the BWA-MEM algorithm (v.0.7.7-r441). PCR
duplicate reads were flagged with the Picard MarkDuplicates
software (v.1.123). A local realignment step was then performed
around known indels and base qualities were recalibrated with
GATK software (v.3.2-2-gec30cee). Ploidy was estimated from
normalized read counts using a sliding window approach as imple-
mented in Control-Freec software (v.7.2).46 For each individual,
the median of all windows’ ploidy was then reported.
Statistical Analyses
We used the statistical software R (v.3.2.3)47 for data mining and
statistical analyses. Cox proportional hazards regressions were
performed with the Survival package in R (Web Resources). Pooled
analyses using data from the ULSAM and PIVUS cohorts were fitted
with the strata-option in the Cox-model to define source of data.
Study entry in the Cox regressions were the date of blood sampling
and age was used as timeline. Confounding factors at baseline
that were fitted in statistical analyses are summarized in Table S1.
LOY was modeled both as a continuous explanatory variable (i.e.,
mLRRY) and as a binary variable after scoring participants based
on defined thresholds of mLRRY, as described in the Results.
Results
We present results of association between mosaic LOY in
blood and risk of AD diagnosis from analyses performed
in three independent studies. First, we separately describe
results from analyses of four confounding factors such as
quality of genotyping experiments, sampling age of partic-
ipants, APOE genotype, and smoking, which are particu-
larly important for our study.
Assessment of Genotyping Quality and Validation of
LOY via WGS
A continuous estimate of the level of LOY in each partici-
pant (i.e., mLRRY) was calculated from the SNP probes
within the MSY, as described in Materials and Methods
and previously.30,31 The quality of individual SNP-array ex-
periments could be a confounding factor when estimating
the level of LOY and therefore needs careful consideration.
To minimize the potential bias from bad-quality data, we
applied a stringent criterion for all experiments, as recom-
mended by the SNP-array manufacturer (Figure S2). In
brief, we calculated this quality metric from each experi-
ment as the standard deviation of the log R ratio values
of the SNP probes located on chromosome 1. A high value
reflects poor genotyping quality whereas experiments with
value below 0.28 are considered high quality (see link in
Web Resources to Illumina Tech Note). In total, 3,218 ex-
periments passed this quality control and were included
in further analyses (Figure S3). Furthermore, validation of
the SNP-array-based inferences of LOY was achieved by
analysis of next-generation whole-genome sequencing
data (WGS). This was performed by estimating ploidy
values from WGS data using the FREEC software.46 Using
this approach in 100 ULSAM participants, all observations
of LOY as well as other autosomal mosaic copy-number
variants detected by SNP array could be validated using
the low-coverage (~53) WGS data, as described previ-
ously.30 A similar strategy was used to validate LOY obser-
vations in SNP-array data in the EADI1 study using WGS
data with higher coverage (~303) from 183 participants
among the 1,611 passing the genotyping quality assess-
ment (Figure S3). As illustrated in Figure 1, the two inde-
pendent technologies applied in EADI1 produced fully
concordant estimates of individuals’ LOY status.
Association between LOY in Blood Cells and Age
Of the 3,218 participants included in our analyses, 546
(17.0%) had a detectable level of LOY mosaicism, i.e., an
mLRRY value lower than the 99% confidence limit of
the experimental variation. The frequency of LOY was
similar in the ULSAM, PIVUS, and EADI1 cohorts with
17.5%, 21.1%, and 15.4% of participants scored, respec-
tively. A linear regression model performed on this data-
set showed that LOY was more common in older partici-
pants (F(1, 3216) ¼ 26.79, p < 0.0001) (Figure 2A), and
grouping participants based on age (Figures 2E and 2F)
1210
The American Journal of Human Genetics 98, 1208–1219, June 2, 2016
 further illustrates that the fraction of men affected with
LOY is increasing with participant age. Hence, both the
frequency of LOY and the incidence of AD are positively
correlated with age. This covariation was handled by
fitting the effect of age at baseline as a continuous
explanatory variable in the statistical models evaluating
the association between LOY in blood cells and AD. We
also evaluated the influence of age in the investigation of
LOY on AD risk by analyses in two subsets of men within
narrow age ranges (see below).
LOY and APOE Genotype
The Apolipoprotein E (APOE [MIM: 107741]) genotype and
in particular homozygosity for the APOE epsilon 4 risk allele
is a well-established risk factor for AD.4 An analysis of the
level of LOY observed among individuals with different
APOE genotypes (i.e., A22, A23, A24, A33, A34, and A44)
in the three cohorts showed no significant differences
(ANOVA; F(5,3037) ¼ 0.4760, p ¼ 0.7950) (Figure S4A). We
also tested association between LOY and APOE genotype
after grouping subjects homozygous for the APOE epsilon
4 risk allele or not and found no significant differences
(Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; D ¼ 0.0393, p ¼ 0.7836)
(Figure S4B). These results suggest that degree of LOY
mosaicism within the studied men is independent from
their APOE genotype. However, because APOE genotype
is a strong risk factor for AD that explains a substantial
portion of the variation in AD, a binary variable reflecting
the APOE epsilon 4 allele homozygosity state (1/0) was
fitted as in subsequent statistical models evaluating associ-
ation between LOY and AD.
LOY and Smoking
We have previously showed that LOY in blood cells is
associated
with
smoking.31
Moreover,
some
studies
suggest that smoking might play a role in dementia and
Alzheimer disease.48,49 The present dataset
included
1,565 subjects passing genotyping quality control and
with smoking data available (n ¼ 1,097 and n ¼ 468 in
ULSAM and PIVUS, respectively). However, in the current
dataset there was no significant association between
smoking status at 70 years of age and AD diagnosis (logis-
tic regression; p ¼ 0.2570). The lack of association be-
tween AD diagnosis and smoking status was replicated
also after adjusting for the confounding effects of APOE
genotype and sampling age (logistic regression; p ¼
0.2459). Nevertheless, the potential effect from smoking
on AD status was fitted as a binary variable (current
smoker at age 70 or not) in the subsequent models testing
association between LOY and risk for AD. Furthermore,
we also tested association between LOY and risk for AD
in a subset including non-current smokers only (see
below).
Association between LOY and AD in Case-Control
Analyses
Results from the EADI1 case-control study including
1,611 subjects with high-quality genotyping data showed
that 606 AD-affected subjects had a significantly higher
degree
of
LOY
in
blood
cells
(i.e.,
lower
mLRRY)
compared to 1,005 control subjects in an unadjusted
test of association (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: D ¼ 0.07,
p ¼ 0.0198) (Figure 3A). Furthermore, this association
was significant also in models adjusting for the effects
from the confounding factors APOE genotype and age
at sampling (Figure 3B and Table S2A). The confounders
analyzed are summarized in Table S1. A logistic regression
model further showed, after adjusting for APOE genotype
and age, that EADI1 men with a higher fraction of cells
without chromosome Y were more likely to be diagnosed
with AD (OR ¼ 2.80, 95% CI ¼ 1.19–6.61, p ¼ 0.0184)
(Table S2B). We also performed case-control analyses after
pooling the data from the EADI1, ULSAM, and PIVUS co-
horts (n ¼ 3,218) with results comparable to the above
(unadjusted Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: D ¼ 0.05, p ¼
0.0390) (Figure 3C) and in a model adjusting for APOE ge-
notype and age (ANCOVA: F(1,3085) ¼ 7.44, p ¼ 0.0064)
(Figure 3D). Furthermore, we also analyzed the ULSAM
and PIVUS data as case-controls, both separately (Figures
3E and 3F) and pooled together (Figures 3G and 3H). In
summary, comparisons of participants from three inde-
pendent studies show that men with AD diagnosis had
a higher degree of LOY mosaicism in blood compared
to controls.
Association between LOY and Risk for AD in Two
Prospective Cohorts
The association between LOY in blood cells and risk for
AD diagnosis was also examined using Cox proportional
hazards regression model performed with the R package
Survival (Web Resources). These analyses were performed
using a pooled dataset encompassing results from two pro-
spective cohorts (i.e., ULSAMþPIVUS) and no prevalent
cases of AD were included, i.e., cases diagnosed prior

 to study baseline (n ¼ 8). Among the 1,599 participants
included in these analyses, 140 incident cases of AD were
observed during follow-up time (123 in ULSAM and 17
in PIVUS). Study entry in the Cox regressions were the
date of blood sampling and age was used as timeline.
The median follow-up time was 8.7 years (range of 0–
20.2 years) and 7.8 years (range 0.3–9.8 years) for ULSAM
and PIVUS studies, respectively. In the primary Cox regres-
sion model, the continuous mLRRY was used as predictor
of AD risk. In the model, we adjusted for the effects from
the following set of confounders: APOE epsilon 4 genotype,
age at sampling, smoking, BMI, diabetes, LDL and HDL

cholesterol,
hypertension,
exercise
habits, education level, and alcohol
consumption. We also tested whether
subjects harboring blood cell clones
with large-scale (>1 Mb) structural
aberrations on the autosomal chro-
mosomes was affecting probability
of AD-free follow-up time. All of the
baseline confounders are summarized
in Table S1. The results from the
adjusted Cox regression show a strong
association between level of LOY
mosaicism at the time of blood sam-
pling and risk for incident AD diag-
nosis during the follow-up time (HR
¼ 6.80, 95% CI ¼ 2.16–21.43, p ¼
0.0011) (Table 1). It is also noteworthy
that other previously known risk fac-
tors for AD, i.e., age at sampling and
APOE genotype, showed strong associ-
ations with AD risk, independent of
the risk from LOY (Table 1). A model
including only the significant confounders in the model
(i.e., APOE epsilon 4 genotype and age at sampling) showed
a similar result (Table S3).
To visualize the above results, we scored participants us-
ing two different thresholds for level of LOY mosaicism, as
explained in Figure S1 and published previously.30 The first
was the lower 99% confidence limit of experimentally
induced mLRRY variation and the second threshold was
a stricter cut-off at mLRRY %�0.4. These thresholds repre-
sent LOY in ~10% and ~35% of leukocytes, respectively.30
We plotted the adjusted probabilities of an AD-free follow-
up time for the groups of participants scored with LOYand

 men without detectable LOY, using these two thresholds.
The comparison between the groups confirmed the results
from analyses using the continuous mLRRY, that LOY in
blood cells is a significant risk factor for AD diagnosis (Fig-
ures 4A and 4C, Tables S4 and S5). Interestingly, the risk of
AD
diagnosis
during
follow-up
was
higher
in
men
harboring LOY in ~35% of cells compared to subject with
LOY in ~10% of cells. Furthermore, risk for AD diagnosis
during follow-up time among men with and without
LOY in blood at sampling was evaluated separately in the
ULSAM and PIVUS cohorts as shown in Figure S5. Among
the 674 ULSAM men without any cancers, 90 were diag-
nosed with AD during follow-up and LOY in blood at sam-
pling was a significant risk factor (HR ¼ 1.90, 95% CI ¼
1.13–3.20, p ¼ 0.0148). In the separate analysis of the
smaller PIVUS cohort, the association between LOY in
blood and risk for AD was not significant but a similar
trend could be observed.
Three independent papers recently demonstrated asso-
ciations between LOY in blood and risk for various can-
cers30,36,37 and in the present study we show that LOY
in blood is also associated with risk for AD diagnosis. It
is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that cancer and
AD would act as competing risks when analyzing the ef-
fects of LOY. The suspicion of competing risks was sup-
ported by results from an analysis of 990 ULSAM and
PIVUS men that were free from any cancer diagnosis
and without AD diagnosis before the date of blood sam-
pling (Figure S3). Specifically, we performed correspond-
ing Cox regressions in this subset of 990 men, as
described above for the 1,599 participants, and found an

the continuous mLRRY (HR ¼ 28.41, 95% CI ¼ 7.05–
114.44, p < 0.0001) (Table S6) and then scoring partici-
pants with or without LOY using the same thresholds as
above (Figures 4B and 4D, Tables S7 and S8). Furthermore,
our recent report on an association between increased risk
for non-hematological cancer from LOY in blood cells
(HR ¼ 3.76, 95% CI ¼ 1.21–11.67, p ¼ 0.022)30 was
done disregarding the competing risk of AD, and we
therefore performed here a new analogous analysis after
excluding participants with AD diagnosis. As anticipated,
the association between LOY in blood cells and risk for
non-hematological cancer mortality was strengthened in
this refined analysis (HR ¼ 5.58, 95% CI ¼ 1.72–18.06,
p ¼ 0.0041) (Table S9).

 As mentioned above, age and LOY are both associated
with risk of AD and covariates in statistical analyses.
Hence, the effect from age at sampling was fitted in Cox
models testing association between LOY and AD (Figure 4,
Tables 1 and S4–S9) and thus, these models are estimating
independent risks from age and LOY. Nevertheless, we also
performed exploratory Cox regressions including two sub-
sets of men within similar age ranges (i.e., 70–75 years and
75–80 years, respectively), thus reducing the confounding
effect from age. Also in these analyses, LOY was associated
with risk for AD whereas the previously significant age
effect (seen in models including men of all ages) could
not be observed. These results therefore corroborate a hy-
pothesis of an association between LOY and increased
risk for AD, in addition to the increased risk for AD that
is conferred by age (Tables S10 and S11).
We have previously shown that smoking is associated
with LOY31 and some studies suggest that smoking might
play a role in dementia and AD.48,49 We therefore per-
formed further exploratory analyses including non-cur-
rent smokers at 70 years of age only. The association
between LOY in blood and risk for incident AD during
follow-up time was significant also in this subset of partic-
ipants (HR ¼ 6.04, 95% CI ¼ 1.46–25.00, p ¼ 0.0131)
(Table S12). This result may suggest that LOY in blood in-
creases the risk for AD independent of smoking status,
even though current smokers have a higher risk for being
affected
by LOY.31
To
conclude,
the
main findings
regarding LOY from various statistical tests in three stud-
ied cohorts are summarized in Table 2.
Discussion
Our results suggest that men with mosaic LOY in periph-
eral blood cells are at an increased risk of AD (Figures 3
and 4), in addition to the previously described risk of
non-hematological cancer.30 A critical question is whether
LOY per se is important in the pathogenesis of AD and can-
cer, or whether LOY is a phenotypically neutral product of
aging that co-varies with other common aging-related
phenotypes, for example cancer and AD? We carefully
considered the latter hypothesis by fitting the age at sam-
pling as a co-covariate in the statistical models evaluating
LOY and AD. Moreover, we performed analyses of associa-
tion between LOY and AD in two subsets of men within
narrow age windows, which would tend to neutralize an
effect from age at sampling. The association between
LOY in blood and incident AD was robust in these ana-
lyses, whereas the effect of age was not significant (Tables
S10 and S11), supporting the first hypothesis. Thus, a
reasonable interpretation of these results so far is that
LOY has a direct influence on the pathogenesis of AD
and cancer. The analysis of our data can also be discussed
in the perspective of the differences between chronological
and biological age, because LOY could be considered a
marker for biological age, and as such a possible driver
behind AD and cancer outcomes. Future investigations of
LOY could therefore benefit from analyzing the biological
rather than the chronological age. Our results are further
consistent with LOY in peripheral blood representing the
most frequently occurring ACE, affecting up to 20% of
the oldest men in the studied population (Figure 2). In
our analyses we also considered the ACEs containing
post-zygotic structural aberrations on autosomes, but no
significant association between risk for AD and ACEs car-
rying autosomal aberrations of >1 Mb in blood cells could
be observed.
We havepreviouslyshown that cigarette smoking islikely
to induce LOY in blood in a dose-dependent and transient
manner.31 It has further been suggested that smoking is a
risk factor for development of AD.48,49 Moreover, smoking
is a well-known risk factor for cancer development, with
lung cancer being the prime cause of cancer-associated
death. Smoking is also a risk factor for tumors outside the
respiratory tract and these are more common in males
than females.50 Considering the above,we have thoroughly
tested the possible effects of smoking in the statistical
models in the current paper. In order to understand the rela-
tionship between smoking, LOY, and risk for AD, we
included smoking as a co-variate in our analyses. There
was no significant association between smoking status at
70 years of age and AD diagnosis in our dataset. We further
tested a model when current smokers were excluded from
the analysis. The results showed that the subset of non-
smokers still have an increased risk for AD when affected
with LOY (Table S12). In summary, our results imply that
smoking could induce LOY, which in turn increases risks
for both cancer and AD.

 Our findings may suggest a role of LOY observed in
non-cancerous blood cells on disease processes that
take place in other tissues. Thus, an intriguing question
is: what is the mechanism involving LOY in blood in
the development of two radically different conditions,
one being a neurodegenerative process in the central
nervous
system
(CNS)
and
another
encompassing
abnormal proliferation of cells leading to tumors in
various organs? We hypothesized previously that de-
fective functions of immunosurveillance of the im-
mune cells in blood might be related the effect of LOY
on
increased
risk
of
tumor
development
in
other
organs.30,31
A
deficient
immunosurveillance
in
the
CNS, i.e., a process that normally should eliminate
abnormal cells related to AD phenotype in the brain,
has been proposed as a mechanism in disease de-
velopment.51–53 Moreover, the AD literature provides
independent lines of evidence pointing toward the

Probabilities for AD-free follow-up time

lower than the 99% confidence limit of
the experimental variation were scored
with LOY (A and B) and a threshold at
mLRRY % �0.4 was used (C and D). The
analyses were performed using pooled
data from the ULSAM and PIVUS studies.
Shown are analyses with all men (A and

ogous analyses after excluding men with

tem in disease development.10,54 For
instance,
certain

and

that

AD.
Hence,
gene-
rally

functions, as an effect of LOY, could
link the increased risk of AD as well
as the risk of various tumor types.
Another and non-mutually exclusive
hypothesis is that LOY in blood cells
could be a mirror of parallel processes
of chromosomal instability also present in other cell
types, such as neurons. It has been shown that AD neu-
rons re-enter the cell cycle, leading to increased risk of
various mitotic errors, such as aneuploidy, that has
been documented in both normal and AD-affected
brain cells.56,57
Regardless
of
the
underlying
mechanism(s)
for
the increased risks of AD and cancer in men with LOY
in blood, our and others’ published results reinforce
a role of factors on chromosome Y in various, still
poorly explored biological processes, other than sex
determination
and
sperm
production.20,21,36–39,58
Furthermore, our results demonstrate the importance
of ACEs harboring post-zygotic aberrations, i.e., life-
time-acquired genetic variants, on the risk of deve-
lopment of common disease. In developed countries,
dementia represents the third most common cause
of morbidity/mortality in humans59 and about one in

 three people will get a cancer diagnosis during life.60 We
hypothesize that the measurement of LOY in blood cells
of adult/aging men could become a new, early predictive
biomarker for AD and cancer, thus helping to relieve
some of the huge burden that these diseases pose on in-
dividuals and society. This would also be well in line
with an anticipated shift into a more preventive and
personalized medical care. Finally, it has been known
for centuries that men have a shorter life expectancy
compared to women,61 even in regions of the world
with well-developed healthcare,62 but the underlying
factor(s) behind this sex difference are not clear. Mosaic
LOY in blood, being a male-specific risk factor for both
AD and cancer, might at least partly explain why men
on average live shorter than women.

The ‘‘cont. mLRRY’’ is the continuous mLRRY estimate (i.e., the median of the log R ratio values of SNP-array probes positioned within the male-specific region of
chromosome Y) reflecting the degree of LOY mosaicism in each participant. We also scored participants as 1 or 0 based on their mLRRY value using two different
thresholds, i.e., mLRRY < �0.4 and mLRRY < 99% CI, as further described in the text. Abbreviations are as follows: D, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic;
