IMPORTANCE While statin therapy for primary cardiovascular prevention has been associated
with reductions in cardiovascular morbidity, the effect on all-cause mortality has been
variable. There is little evidence to guide the use of statins for primary prevention in adults
75 years and older.
OBJECTIVES To examine statin treatment among adults aged 65 to 74 years and 75 years and
older when used for primary prevention in the Lipid-Lowering Trial (LLT) component of the
Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT-LLT).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Post hoc secondary data analyses were conducted of
participants 65 years and older without evidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease;
2867 ambulatory adults with hypertension and without baseline atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease were included. The ALLHAT-LLT was conducted from February 1994
to March 2002 at 513 clinical sites.
INTERVENTIONS Pravastatin sodium (40 mg/d) vs usual care (UC).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome in the ALLHAT-LLT was all-cause
mortality. Secondary outcomes included cause-specific mortality and nonfatal myocardial
infarction or fatal coronary heart disease combined (coronary heart disease events).
RESULTS There were 1467 participants (mean [SD] age, 71.3 [5.2] years) in the pravastatin
group (48.0% [n = 704] female) and 1400 participants (mean [SD] age, 71.2 [5.2] years) in
the UC group (50.8% [n = 711] female). The baseline mean (SD) low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol levels were 147.7 (19.8) mg/dL in the pravastatin group and 147.6 (19.4) mg/dL in
the UC group; by year 6, the mean (SD) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were 109.1
(35.4) mg/dL in the pravastatin group and 128.8 (27.5) mg/dL in the UC group. At year 6, of
the participants assigned to pravastatin, 42 of 253 (16.6%) were not taking any statin; 71.0%
in the UC group were not taking any statin. The hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in the
pravastatin group vs the UC group were 1.18 (95% CI, 0.97-1.42; P = .09) for all adults 65 years
and older, 1.08 (95% CI, 0.85-1.37; P = .55) for adults aged 65 to 74 years, and 1.34 (95% CI,
0.98-1.84; P = .07) for adults 75 years and older. Coronary heart disease event rates were not
significantly different among the groups. In multivariable regression, the results remained
nonsignificant, and there was no significant interaction between treatment group and age.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE No benefit was found when pravastatin was given for primary
prevention to older adults with moderate hyperlipidemia and hypertension, and a
nonsignificant direction toward increased all-cause mortality with pravastatin was observed
among adults 75 years and older.

 T
he number of older adults in the United States is in-
creasing rapidly. According to the US Census Bureau,1
there are approximately 6 million people in the United
States 85 years and older, and this group is expected to be 9
million by 2030. Many older patients take statins for primary
cardiovascular prevention. In a study2 at the Geisinger Health
System in Pennsylvania, 28% of patients aged 75 to 79 years
and 22% of patients 80 years and older were taking a statin for
primary prevention. Another study3 that analyzed the Medi-
cal Expenditure Panel Survey found that statin use for pri-
mary prevention for adults older than 79 years increased from
8.8% in 1999-2000 to 34.1% in 2011-2012. While there is some
evidenceofbenefittosecondarypreventionwithstatinsamong
olderadults,4,5dataarelimitedontherisksandbenefitsofstat-
ins for primary prevention in this age group.5 Improving our
understanding of preventive interventions in patients 75 years
and older has many implications for health care and its costs.
Until recently, decisions to initiate statins for primary pre-
vention in patients were based largely on cardiovascular risk
models developed from the Framingham Heart Study.6 This
risk score has been demonstrated to be inaccurate in predict-
ing cardiovascular events among the oldest adults (≥85 years).7
Elevated lipid levels are less predictive of cardiovascular risk
with increasing age,8 and low lipid levels in the oldest adults
usuallycorrelatewithincreasedmortality.8-11Furthermore,the
2013 guideline from the American College of Cardiology and
the American Heart Association emphasized that “Few data
wereavailabletoindicateanatheroscleroticcardiovasculardis-
ease (ASCVD) event reduction benefit in primary prevention
among individuals >75 years of age who do not have clinical
ASCVD,”12(pS24) and the risk calculator developed has a cutoff
age of 79 years.12 However, these guidelines imply a dispro-
portionate risk based on age, and there is controversy about
overestimating risk among older adults.13 The recently pub-
lished US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines of statin
use for primary prevention also highlight the lack of evi-
dence for its use in older adults (especially for adults ≥76
years).14 In addition, these guidelines raised many controver-
sies regarding the evidence of statin use for primary preven-
tion in asymptomatic adults, particularly for older adults.15
Statins for primary prevention have been associated with
some reductions in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (AS-
CVD) morbidity for older adults in some large clinical trials,16-18
while not in another trial,19 and most studies16-19 do not show
an effect on all-cause mortality. Given the conflicting evi-
dence, particularly for adults 75 years and older, there are sev-
eral reasons to think that there may be heterogeneity of the
effects of statins when used for primary prevention in older
age groups. A recent Markov modeling study20 found that stat-
ins for primary prevention for adults 75 years and older would
be cost-effective in preventing cardiovascular-related events
(including coronary heart disease [CHD], stroke, revascular-
ization procedures, and death). However, the authors noted
that “even a small increase in geriatric-specific adverse ef-
fects could offset the cardiovascular benefit.”20(p533) Despite
the potential benefit of statins for primary cardiovascular pre-
vention, even small adverse effects in older adults could lead
to harm and may explain the inconsistent data on all-cause
mortality. However, owing to the low proportion of older
adults enrolled in clinical trials, it is difficult to fully under-
stand the risks and benefits of statins for primary prevention
in this population compared with younger adults. The objec-
tive of this study was to conduct secondary data analyses of
several important outcomes of a large subset of older adults
without baseline ASCVD from the Antihypertensive and
Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial–
Lipid-Lowering Trial (ALLHAT-LLT)21 to evaluate the overall
benefit for older adults.
Methods
We performed a subanalysis of the LLT component of the ALL-
HAT. The design of the ALLHAT has been previously
described.22-24 Briefly, the ALLHAT-LLT, sponsored by the Na-
tional Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Insti-
tutes of Health, was a randomized, open-label trial con-
ducted from February 1994 to March 2002 at 513 clinical sites.
All participants of the ALLHAT-LLT were drawn exclusively
from the parent trial, ALLHAT, which was an antihyperten-
sive trial designed to determine if treatment with a calcium
channel blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibi-
tor, or an α-blocker reduces fatal CHD or nonfatal myocardial
infarction compared with treatment with a thiazide-type di-
uretic. Details regarding sample size, recruitment, and ran-
domization have been published elsewhere.21-24 Access to the
full protocol may be found at http://www.ALLHAT.org.25 The
trial protocol for the ALLHAT-LLT is available in Supplement
1. The institutional review board of The University of Texas
HealthScienceCenteratHoustonapprovedthesecondarydata
analysis.
Study Population
Eligibility for the ALLHAT-LLT included ambulatory adults 55
years and older having stage 1 or 2 hypertension with at least
one additional CHD risk factor, randomized to 1 of 4 antihy-
pertensive drugs. Participants for the ALLHAT-LLT were ex-
cluded if they were currently receiving lipid-lowering therapy,
were known to be intolerant of statins, manifested signifi-
cant liver or kidney disease, or had a known secondary cause
Key Points
Question Are statins beneficial when used for primary
cardiovascular prevention in older adults?
Findings In this post hoc secondary analysis of older adults in the
randomized clinical trial Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering
Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial–Lipid-Lowering Trial
(ALLHAT-LLT), there were no significant differences in all-cause
mortality or cardiovascular outcomes between pravastatin sodium
and usual care for primary prevention for adults 65 years and
older.
Meaning No benefit was found when a statin was given for
primary prevention to older adults. Treatment recommendations
should be individualized for this population.

 of hyperlipidemia. For individuals without known CHD, a fast-
ing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level of 120 to
189 mg/dL and a fasting triglycerides level lower than 350
mg/dL were required (to convert cholesterol level to milli-
moles per liter, multiply by 0.0259; to convert triglycerides
level to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0113). Ultimately,
10 355adultswereenrolledintheALLHAT-LLT.Amongthepar-
ticipants of the ALLHAT-LLT, we performed a subanalysis only
of those individuals who were 65 years and older and with-
out evidence of ASCVD (CHD, peripheral vascular disease, and
cerebrovascular disease) at baseline. The full ASCVD criteria
are listed in eTable 1 in Supplement 2.
Treatment
The intervention for the ALLHAT-LLT was open-label prava-
statin sodium (40 mg/d) vs usual care (UC), and participants
were randomly assigned to the 2 groups in a ratio of 1:1. Ini-
tially, participants in the pravastatin group began with a prava-
statin sodium dosage of 20 mg/d and increased to 40 mg/d as
needed to achieve a 25% decrease in LDL-C level; however, af-
ter the first 1000 participants enrolled in the study, a con-
stant dosage of 40 mg/d was adopted for all participants in the
pravastatin group. Study practitioners had the option to lower
the dosage, discontinue treatment with pravastatin due to ad-
verse effects, and prescribe other cholesterol-lowering drugs.
The UC group was treated for LDL-C level lowering based on
the discretion of their primary care physician.
Follow-up
Follow-up visits were done at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after an-
tihypertensive trial randomization and every 4 months there-
after. Along with determination of the fasting total choles-
terol level and questions about intervening events, at the
2-year, 4-year, and 6-year follow-up visits, a fasting lipid pro-
file was obtained in random preselected samples of UC (5%)
and pravastatin (10%) participants (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
Outcomes
The primary outcome in the ALLHAT-LLT was all-cause mor-
tality. Secondary outcomes included cause-specific mortal-
ity and nonfatal myocardial infarction or fatal CHD combined
(CHD events). Study end points were ascertained at fol-
low-up visits or by death certificates for all deaths and hospi-
taldischargesummariesforeachhospitalizedstudyevent.Fur-
ther details of the event ascertainment process are published
elsewhere.22
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed during the entire study period of
the trial with follow-up according to participants’random-
ized treatment assignments regardless of subsequent cross-
over (intent-to-treat analysis). Characteristics of participants
included in this analysis were calculated by age range and par-
ticipants’randomized treatment assignments, with statisti-
cal significance of differences determined using t tests or χ2
tests as appropriate. The cumulative event rates for each out-
come by age range were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier
method. A participant’
s duration in the study started at ran-
domization to the ALLHAT-LLT and ended at the date of last
knownfollow-upordeath.TheCoxproportionalhazardsmodel

provide hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs. A multivariable-
adjusted model was constructed to give HRs that included the
following predefined cardiac risks factors: baseline age, sex,
black race/ethnicity, aspirin use (for primary prevention), cur-
rent cigarette smoker, the presence of type 2 diabetes, body
massindex,andsystolicanddiastolicbloodpressures.Wecon-
ducted sensitivity analyses testing the interaction between
treatment group and age to assess if the treatment effect dif-
feredbetweenadults75yearsandolderandthoseyoungerthan
75 years. For all analyses, a 2-tailed P < .05 was considered sta-
tistically significant. Statistical software (Stata, version 14;
StataCorp LP) was used for all analyses.
Results
Among the 10 355 participants in the ALLHAT-LLT, 4546 were
excluded owing to age younger than 65 years, and an addi-
tional 2942 participants with ASCVD at baseline were ex-
cluded (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). The analytical sample was
2867 ambulatory adults 65 years and older with hyperten-
sionandwithoutASCVDatbaseline(Figure1).Therewere1467
participants in the pravastatin group and 1400 participants in
the UC group. The baseline characteristics, including serum
lipid levels stratified by age group (65-74 years and ≥75 years)
andbytreatmentgroup(pravastatinvsUC),arelistedinTable1.
In participants aged 65 to 74 years, the mean years of fol-
low-up differed significantly for pravastatin (4.63 years) vs UC
(4.77 years) (P = .04). Losses to follow-up in the ALLHAT-LLT
are discussed elsewhere.21 Among participants 75 years and
older, 86.7% (325 of 375) of the pravastatin group were taking
antihypertensive medications vs 92.9% (326 of 351) of the

der cited adverse effects and other medical and nonmedical

There was no benefit of pravastatin for any of the pri-
mary and secondary outcomes (Table 2 and Figure 2). For the
primary outcome, all-cause mortality, more deaths occurred
in the pravastatin group compared with the UC group in both
age groups (Table 2). For participants aged 65 to 74 years, there
were 141 deaths in the pravastatin group and 130 deaths in the
UC group (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.85-1.37; P = .55). For partici-
pants 75 years and older, there was a nonsignificant increase
in mortality in the pravastatin group, with 92 deaths vs 65
deaths in the UC group (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.98-1.84; P = .07).
There were 76 CHD events in the pravastatin group and 89
CHD events in the UC group for adults aged 65 to 74 years (HR,
0.85; 95% CI, 0.62-1.15; P = .29), and there were 31 CHD events
in the pravastatin group and 39 CHD events in the UC group
for adults 75 years and older (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.43-1.13;
P = .14) (Table 2). Stroke, heart failure, and cancer rates were
similar in the 2 treatment groups for both age groups.
In multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, the
adjusted HR (pravastatin vs UC) for all-cause mortality for all
participants 65 years and older was 1.15 (95% CI, 0.94-1.39;
P = .17) (Table 3). In the age group 65 to 74 years, the HR was
1.05 (95% CI, 0.82-1.33); for the age group 75 years and older,
the HR was 1.36 (95% CI, 0.98-1.89) (P = .24 for interaction).
Multivariable regression for CHD events adjusting for the
same cardiovascular risk factors did not significantly change
the risk across all age groups, and there was no significant
interaction between treatment group and age (eTable 4A and
eTable 4B in Supplement 2).

that could offset any possible cardiovascular benefit.
Statins may have an effect on the physical or mental func-
tioning of older adults, and studies26,27 have shown that any
negative effect on function places older adults at higher risk
for functional decline and death. Older adults are at in-
creased risk for statin-induced muscle problems; the risk of
hospitalization for rhabdomyolysis in patients 65 years and
older is more than 5 times higher than that in younger adults.28
It has also been suggested that statins have negative effects on
energyandfatiguewithexertion.29Therefore,itispossiblethat,
for vulnerable older adults, statins may have negative effects
on function. Evidence has suggested that statin use may have
negative effects on cognition, particularly in adults with mild
cognitive impairment or dementia.30 However, a recent ma-
jor review of the efficacy and safety of statins using trial data
found no effect of statins on incident dementia or on cogni-
tive function.31 However, that study fails to acknowledge that
current trial data do not include many people 80 years and
older or older frail adults; other individual trials were under-
powered to identify the harms of statin therapy.32
Observational studies33-35 from around the world have
shown mixed findings regarding the benefit of statins for pri-
mary prevention in older adults. The only large lipid treat-
ment clinical study specifically targeting older adults was the
Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk
(PROSPER).19 Among the participants in the PROSPER with-
out vascular disease at baseline (ie, primary prevention)
(n = 3239), the use of pravastatin did not result in significant
reductions in CHD or stroke events during a mean 3.2-year
follow-up.19 If one subtracts from the all-cause mortality data
of PROSPER19 with the specific results of mortality of older pa-
tients with CHD published by Afilalo et al,36 the mortality rate
in the PROSPER in participants without CHD at baseline was
8.8% in those receiving placebo vs 9.6% in those receiving
statin therapy.
The other major randomized trial that had a large propor-
tion of older individuals, the Justification for the Use of Stat-
ins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuva-
statin(JUPITER),17included5695individuals70yearsandolder
with no cardiovascular disease at baseline but with a high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein level of 2 mg/L or more (to con-
vert C-reactive protein level to nanomoles per liter, multiply
by 9.524). A secondary analysis of participants 70 years and
older in the JUPITER study17 found all-cause mortality of 1.63
per 100 person-years in those receiving rosuvastatin and 2.04
per 100 person-years in those receiving placebo, a difference
that was not statistically significant (P = .09). The JUPITER
study has come under criticism pertaining to the early termi-
nation of the trial and strong commercial conflicts of interest.37

 port for the broader use of statins for primary prevention in
intermediate-risk populations. HOPE-3 enrolled men 55 years
and older and women 65 years and older who had at least one
cardiovascular risk factor or women 60 years and older with
2 risk factors, all without a diagnosis of ASCVD. Participants
were randomized to rosuvastatin (mean age, 65.8 years) or pla-
cebo (mean age, 65.7 years). At a median follow-up of 5.6 years,
the first coprimary outcome (a composite of death from car-
diovascular causes, nonfatal stroke, or nonfatal myocardial in-
farction) occurred significantly less frequently with rosuva-
statin than with placebo (3.7% vs 4.8%). There was no
difference in death from any cause between the rosuvastatin
group and the placebo group (5.3% vs 5.6%). While HOPE-3 ap-
pears to show benefit of statins for primary prevention for car-
diovascular outcomes among a younger population of older
adults, there was no benefit for all-cause mortality, although
this measure was not a primary or secondary outcome. Strati-
fication by age 65.3 years and younger vs older than 65.3 years
gave similar estimates, but further analysis of the subgroup of
older adults (particularly those ≥75 years) in HOPE-3 is needed.
Strengths and Limitations
A major strength of this study is its large population of
high-risk older adults. The findings of the recent Markov

a Fatal CHD events were ascertained by clinic report or by match with national
databases (see the Outcomes subsection of the Methods section) plus a
confirmatory death certificate. Hospitalized outcomes, such as nonfatal MIs,
were primarily based on clinic investigator reports for which supporting copies
of death certificates and hospital discharge summaries were requested.
Clinical trials center medical reviewers verified the clinician-assigned
diagnoses of outcomes. More detailed information was collected on a random
10% subset of CHD events to validate the procedure of using clinician
diagnoses.

 modeling study20 evaluating the use of statins for primary
prevention in adults aged 75 to 94 years suggested that, if
statins had no effect on functional limitation or cognitive
impairment, primary prevention strategies would prevent
CHD and would also be cost-effective. However, the
ALLHAT-LLT data suggest that, while there may be a trend
toward cardiovascular benefit, there was no all-cause mor-
tality benefit of statins for adults 65 years and older. More
studies that address cardiovascular and noncardiovascular
outcomes are needed to better understand the risks and
benefits of statin therapy for primary prevention in older
adults, particularly for those 75 years and older.
Thefollowinglimitationsshouldbenotedinourstudythat
should give caution when interpreting our findings. This study
is a post hoc secondary analysis of the ALLHAT-LLT of a sub-
group of participants. Another limitation is that an exclusion
criterion for enrollment in the ALLHAT-LLT was current use of
lipid-loweringtherapyatbaseline.Therisk-benefitratioofstatin
therapy in patients who were started on treatment with stat-
ins at a younger age may be different from that among those
75 years and older in whom one is considering initiating treat-
mentwithstatins,andourstudywasunabletoaddressthisrisk.
An additional limitation is the lack of specific adverse effects
datacollectedduringthestudy,andsuchdatacouldhavegiven
abetterunderstandingoftherisksandbenefitsofstatintherapy.
Another major limitation is that our subpopulation of older
adults in the ALLHAT-LLT lessened the number of partici-
pants in each group; therefore, the power of the study might
be insufficient for detecting small differences in risk of infre-
quent events. Other limitations include the open-label design
of this study, potentially increasing the possibility of bias. In
addition, there might have been differences in other nonphar-
macological cholesterol-lowering interventions (eg, diet, ex-
ercise, and weight loss) in the UC group compared with the
pravastatin group, particularly because the control group had
frequentfollow-upvisits,whichcouldmotivateahealthierlife-
style; however, these factors were not measured in the
ALLHAT-LLT. Finally, while there were significant differences
inLDL-Clevelsbyyear6betweenthepravastatingroupandthe
UC group in the preselected participants, an increasing num-
ber of participants in the UC group were taking a lipid-
lowering drug (29.0% [77 of 266]), and an increasing number
ofparticipantsinthepravastatingroupwerenottakingthestudy
drugbyyear6(22.2%[56of204])(crossover).Thislevelofcross-
over should be considered when interpreting our findings.
Conclusions
This secondary analysis of the subset of older adults who par-
ticipatedintheALLHAT-LLTshowednobenefitofprimarypre-
vention for all-cause mortality or CHD events when pravasta-
tin was initiated for adults 65 years and older with moderate
hyperlipidemia and hypertension. A nonsignificant trend to-
ward increased all-cause mortality with pravastatin was ob-
served among adults 75 years and older.
