BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Little is known of the long-term, including school, outcomes of 
children diagnosed with Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) (International Statistical 
Classification of Disease and Related Problems [10th Edition], Australian Modification, P96.1).
METHODS: Linked analysis of health and curriculum-based test data for all children born in 
the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, between 2000 and 2006. Children with NAS 
(n = 2234) were compared with a control group matched for gestation, socioeconomic status, 
and gender (n = 4330, control) and with other NSW children (n = 598 265, population) for 
results on the National Assessment Program: Literacy and Numeracy, in grades 3, 5, and 7.
RESULTS: Mean test scores (range 0–1000) for children with NAS were significantly lower 
in grade 3 (359 vs control: 410 vs population: 421). The deficit was progressive. By grade 
7, children with NAS scored lower than other children in grade 5. The risk of not meeting 
minimum standards was independently associated with NAS (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 
2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2–2.7), indigenous status (aOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 2.2–2.3), 
male gender (aOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.3–1.4), and low parental education (aOR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–
1.6), with all Ps < .001.
CONCLUSIONS: A neonatal diagnostic code of NAS is strongly associated with poor and 
deteriorating school performance. Parental education may decrease the risk of failure. 
Children with NAS and their families must be identified early and provided with support to 
minimize the consequences of poor educational outcomes.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Children with 
neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) may be at risk 
for neurodevelopmental and cognitive problems, but 
their performance at a population level in school in 
comparison with their peers is unknown because of 
diffi
 culties in long-term follow-up.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Australian children 
with NAS perform poorly at school from grade 
3, and results deteriorates even more by high 
school, suggesting that children with NAS must be 
supported beyond withdrawal to minimize the risk of 
school failure and its consequences.

OEI et al 
Neonatal abstinence syndrome 
(NAS) is one of the fastest-growing 
public health problems in the world, 
 
1 
especially in the United States, where 
it is estimated that an infant with NAS 
is born every 25 minutes. 
2 Clinical and 
research efforts to improve the care of 
babies with NAS are considered major 
priorities by the US Congress, 
 
3 
the March of Dimes Foundation, 
 
4 and 
the World Health Organization, 
5 
with significant financial, social, and 
health expenditures. These costs 
are attributed mostly to perinatal 
problems, including low birth weight, 
prematurity, and withdrawal. 
6, 
 
7 With 
prompt recognition and appropriate 
treatment, NAS is an uncommon direct 
cause of death, and there are now a 
rapidly increasing number of children 
and adults with a neonatal history of 
NAS.
Recently, Uebel et al 
8 showed in a 
group of 3842 Australian children 
that NAS was associated with a 
higher risk of health, social, and 
psychological problems even into the 
teenage years. Whether these poor 
outcomes were a direct consequence 
of intrauterine exposure to drugs of 
addiction during critical periods 
of fetal development 
9 or related 
to the socioeconomic and other 
environmental adversities associated 
with parental drug use is unclear. 
10 
Long-term follow-up of this large and 
often chaotic population of children 
is difficult, and tangible evidence of 
long-term functional outcomes after 
resolution of NAS therefore remains 
elusive and concerning.
School performance is 1 of the most 
important outcomes of childhood. 
Around the world, the ability to do 
well in school is consistently related 
to adult success. Children who 
fail at school are at risk for many 
poor adult outcomes, including 
psychiatric and physical illness, 
 
11 
unemployment, delinquency, 
 
12 crime, 
 
13 
drug use, 
 
14 and intergenerational 
disadvantage.15 On a global scale, 
school underachievement costs 
trillions of dollars every year in social 
support, lost earnings, and poor 
health. 
16 The early identification of 
children at risk for school failure is 
often difficult. Learning problems 
may not be recognized until the child 
enters school, and the later a child is 
provided support and intervention, 
the less effective such strategies 
will be. Nevertheless, comparatively 
simple and cost-effective strategies 
are strikingly beneficial in improving 
educational and social outcomes, and 
effects may last well into adulthood 
and extend to affect even subsequent 
generations. 
15
Considering the known risks, 
evidence for school outcomes in 
children with NAS is limited. Children 
with NAS can be identified from 
birth, and factors associated with 
poor outcomes, including educational 
achievement, can theoretically 
be addressed early in life so that 
intervention and support can be 
provided in a timely manner for both 
the child and the family. Because 
long-term follow-up of any child, 
let alone children on a large scale, 
is difficult, we used data linkage to 
determine the relationship between 
a hospital discharge diagnosis 
of NAS (International Statistical 
Classification of Disease and 
Related Problems (10th Edition), 
Australian Modification [ICD-10-AM] 
P96.1) 
17 and school performance 
in compulsory, standardized 
curriculum-based tests for 2236 
children with NAS who were born 
in the state of New South Wales 
(NSW), Australia, between 2000 
and 2006. We hypothesized that 
children with a diagnosis of NAS 
would perform more poorly at school 
than other NSW children even after 
we controlled for other factors 
influencing school outcomes, such as 
socioeconomic and perinatal factors.
METHODS
Study Design and Setting
This study used information from 
Australian administrative databases 
that was collected from children born 
in NSW between July 1, 2000 and 
December 31, 2006 (n = 605 094). 
Three mutually exclusive groups 
were created from this cohort: those 
with a hospital discharge diagnosis of 
NAS (ICD-10-AM P96.1, 
 
17 n = 2234); 
controls matched in a 2:1 ratio for 
factors that were decided a priori to 
influence school outcomes, including 
male gender, 
 
18 gestational age, 
 
19 
year of birth, 
 
20 and socioeconomic 
status (n = 4330);21 and other 
NSW children (n = 598 265). The 
records for each child were linked 
via common identifiers such as 
names, dates of births, addresses, 
and hospital identification numbers 
with probabilistic methods by the 
Centre for Health Record Linkage, a 
dedicated data linkage facility that 
provides data for research and other 
purposes. 
22
Australian Education System
Australian children must start school 
in the calendar year that they turn 
6 years of age. There are 3 main 
education sectors that adhere to a 
single, standard national curriculum: 
Government (free except for nominal 
costs), Independent (fee-based 
and includes home schooling), and 
the National Catholic Education 
Commission (fee-based). 
23
National Assessment Program: 
Literacy and Numeracy
The National Assessment Program: 
Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) 
24 
test was introduced in 2008 to serve 
as a compulsory, curriculum-based 
test for children in all Australian 
schools, including those located 
overseas. It is composed of 5 
domains of testing: reading, writing, 
numeracy, spelling, and grammar/
punctuation. Each test is scored out 
of 1000, which is then graded into 
10 standard achievement bands. The 
scores are scaled to reflect the same 
level of performance, so that a child 
who scores 350 out of 1000 (or a 
band 3) in grade 3, for example, is 
considered to have the same ability

as a child who has the same score in 
grade 5.
Exemptions from testing are granted 
very infrequently (eg, new immigrant 
from a non–English speaking 
country, moral objections from the 
guardians for the test). Each child 
sits for the test 4 times in their 
school career, in grades 3, 5, 7, and 
9 (at ages 8–9, 10–11, 12–13, and 
14–15, respectively). Each grade 
level has a predetermined National 
Minimum Standard (NMS: band 1 
in grade 3, band 3 in grade 5, band 
5 in grade 7). Children who do not 
meet the NMS are considered to not 
have the necessary skills to progress 
to the next level of education and 
to need focused intervention and 
additional support. Nonattendees are 
considered not to meet NMS.
Databases
 
• Perinatal Data Collection (PDC): 
Details of the mother, infant, and 
the birth, including gestation, birth 
weight, parity, and delivery details.
 
• The Admitted Patient Data 
Collection: Details on separations 
(discharges, transfers, and deaths) 
for all NSW residents within and 
outside NSW from 2000 onwards. 
It was used to identify children 
with a diagnosis of NAS (P96.1). 
17
 
• Australian Bureau of Statistics 
Cause of Death: Details on the cause 
of death for NSW residents (ICD-
10-AM). 
25 These data were used to 
identify and exclude children who 
died before 2008 (the inaugural 
NAPLAN test year). Children 
who died after sitting for a test 
were included in analysis for that 
particular grade level.
 
• The NAPLAN database. 
24 Details 
on the age of child at test, parental 
education, Indigenous status, 
school location (ie, metropolitan 
or rural), and test scores. 
Nonattendance was assigned a 
blank score and designated as 
failure to meet NMS. Parental 
education levels were by 
self-report and consisted of 2 
discrete variables: high school 
(from grade 9 to 12) and nonschool 
qualification (from no nonschool 
qualification to bachelor level or 
above).
Participant Selection
Children with a diagnosis of neonatal 
withdrawal from maternal use of 
drugs of dependency, corresponding 
to the ICD-10-AM code P96.1, 
 
17 
were selected from the Admitted 
Patient Data Collection database and 
compared with matched controls 
and with other children in NSW. 
Stillbirths, infants born at <23 or 
>44 weeks’ gestation or of unknown 
gestational age, and those who died 
before the first test in 2008 were 
excluded from analysis.
Data Analysis
Missing data were treated by 
listwise deletion. Demographic 
characteristics and NAPLAN 
outcomes were compared via χ2 and 
Fisher exact tests for categorical 
data of proportions, Student’s t test, 
and analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
for approximately normal data 
(eg, maternal age, gestations, birth 
weights, test scores), with pairwise 
comparisons of 3 study groups 
also examined via Scheffe’s post 
hoc multiple comparison test. The 
Mann–Whitney U test was used for 
nonnormal continuous data (eg, 
duration of hospitalization). Binary 
logistic regression with factors 
determined a priori to be associated 
with poor outcomes, including 
gender, 
 
18 prematurity (<37 weeks’ 
completed gestation), 
 
19 Indigenous 
status (a person of Australian 
Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander 
origin), 
 
26, 
 
27 school remoteness, 
28 and 
parental education levels (lower than 
grade 9 and nonschool: yes or no) 
29 
was conducted to assess influences 
on failure to meet NMS at each grade 
level because previous data show 
that these factors are associated with 
poorer school outcomes. Educational 
information for the primary parent or 
guardian (assumed to be the mother 
in >90% of cases) 
24 was used in the 
analysis because not all children 
had 2 parents. Mean (SD) composite 
scores (ie, average of scores for 
each domain of testing) for children 
born between 2000 and 2001 were 
examined longitudinally from grades 
3, 5, and 7 because this group was 
eligible to sit for all 3 tests. Results 
were compared between children 
with NAS, control children without 
NAS, and other NSW children. All 
were referenced to results published 
by the Department of Education and 
Training. 
24 Statistical significance for 
all analyses was set at P < .05.
Ethics Approval
Ethics approval was obtained from 
the research ethics committees of 
the NSW Population and Health 
Services (2012/09/415), Aboriginal 
Health and Medical Research Council 
(1001/14), and all Australian 
educational sectors: the Board of 
Studies (for government schools), the 
Australian Independent Schools, and 
the Catholic Education Commission 
(D2014/120797).
RESULTS
Linkage was obtained between PDC 
records and at least ≥1 NAPLAN 
test result for 468 239 of 604 829 
(77.4%) NSW children. Linkage rates 
were similar between control (3359 
of 4330, 77.6%) and other NSW 
children (463 192 of 598 265, 77.4%; 
P = .83) but were significantly lower 
in children with NAS (1688 of 2234, 
75.6%; P = .03) ( 
Fig 1).
Patient Demographics
Compared with both control and 
other mothers in NSW, the mothers 
of children with NAS were younger, 
had more previous pregnancies, and 
were more likely to be Indigenous 
and to have had no antenatal care. 
They were more likely to deliver 
in a tertiary hospital and less likely

to undergo cesarean delivery. 
Compared with control and other 
NSW infants, those with NAS were 
more likely to have lower 5-minute 
Apgar scores and lower birth weights 
(even when matched for gestation) 
and were more likely to be admitted 
to a nursery ( 
Table 1).
Parental and School Characteristics
Almost half (44.0%) of the primary 
parents of children with NAS 
either did not disclose high school 
education levels or had a high school 
education below grade 9 (vs 18.4% 
control and 17.1% population 
parents, P < .001). More primary 
parents of NAS children did not have 
nonschool qualifications (70.6% 
vs 44.8% controls and 39.5% 
population, P < .001), only 4.3% 
of NAS parents had a bachelor’s 
degree (vs 19.5% controls and 
23.3% population, P < .001). More 
children with NAS were educated 
in government schools (88.3%) 
compared with control (71.0%) 
and other NSW (68.1%) children 
(P < .001).
Test Scores
Numerical scores (maximum score 
1000) and the proportion of children 
not reaching NMS for each grade of 
testing and for each test domain are 
shown in  
Table 2. Children with NAS 
had significantly lower scores than 
either matched controls or other 
NSW children in every grade and 
every domain of testing. By grade 
7, 37.7% of children with NAS did 
not meet NMS in ≥1 domain (vs 
18.4% control and 14.5% other NSW 
children). Mean serial composite 
scores were consistently lower in 
children with NAS from grades 3 to 
7 compared with the other 2 groups. 
This difference was progressive. By 
the time the children reached grade 
7, scores for children with NAS were 
lower than scores for other children 
in grade 5 ( 
Fig 2).
Logistic regression was conducted 
at each grade level of testing to 
determine the effects of perinatal 
and school factors on failure to meet 
NMS in the overall population, in 
children with NAS only ( 
Table 3). 
In children with NAS, Indigenous 
status (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 
1.7), male gender (aOR 1.3), and 
having a primary parent without

grade 9 or nonschool education (aOR 
1.3) increased the risk of failure to 
meet NMS. In the overall population, 
NAS (aOR 2.5), Indigenous status 
(aOR 2.2), male gender (aOR 1.3), 
prematurity (<37 weeks’ gestation, 
aOR 1.2), and parental education 
below grade 9 (aOR 1.1) or no 
nonschool parental qualification 
(aOR 1.5) increased risk of failure to 
meet NMS.
DISCUSSION
This is the first report of academic 
outcomes at a population level 
for children with a history of NAS. 
Our results show that a diagnosis 
of NAS is associated with poorer 
performance in standardized and 
compulsory curriculum-based tests 
from as early as 8 or 9 years of age 
in grade 3 of school when compared 
with other NSW children, including 
those who were matched for gender, 
gestation, and socioeconomic status. 
Indeed, by the first year of high 
school, children with NAS performed 
even more poorly than other children 
in grade 5 who were, on average, 
2 years younger. By grade 7, 44% of 
children with NAS had failed to meet 
NMS in ≥1 domain of testing.
This finding is of great concern 
because school failure increases the 
risk of myriad poor adult outcomes, 
including depression in women, 
 
11 
criminal activity, 
 
13 and drug use. 
14 
We showed that children with 
NAS performed more poorly in all 
5 test domains, including reading 
or literacy skills, 1 of the most 
important predictors of school 
success. Children who cannot read 
at expected levels by grade 3 are 
less likely to enroll in college or 
graduate high school. 
30 In the United 
Kingdom, two-thirds of prisoners 
have a reading age <11 years.31 
Furthermore, test results in children 
with NAS worsened as they entered 
high school.
The cause for these effects is 
uncertain. NAS is caused by 
transplacental exposure to drugs 
of addiction or dependency that 
interfere with brain function and 
development. Opioids impair 
adult brain function and cognitive 
skills even after only a few days 
of use, 
 
32 and their effects on the 
developing brain are subtle but 
long-lasting 
33 and include alterations 
to neuronal apoptosis, 
 
34 
dendritic morphogenesis, 
 
35 and 
neurotransmitter homeostasis.36 
We did not have information on the 
specific drugs used by the mothers, 
including psychotherapeutic agents, 
but multiple drug use is common 
37 
and includes use of legal substances 
such as alcohol 
38 and nicotine. 
39 
Future studies should be designed to 
assess the impact of these variables 
on school performance in drug-
exposed children and the impact of 
specific agents on children’s learning 
abilities.
Postnatal factors may also compound 
poor outcomes. Infants with NAS may 
be treated for days to weeks with the 
same classes of drugs that initially 
caused the withdrawal, 
 
40 and these 
drugs also have similar neurologic 
effects despite being legally 
prescribed. 
32 There are no data 
evaluating the impact of postnatal 
NAS treatment on long-term 
outcomes, which is currently based 
on subjective clinical assessment, 
and infants are medicated with a 
variety of drugs depending on local 
practice. 
37, 
 
40 Families affected by 
drug use disorders may be more 
socially chaotic, 
41 with increased 
occasions of out-of-home care, 
 
42 
school mobility, 
 
43 and other stressors 
such as poverty, poor nutrition, and 
poor parenting skills. 
44 In a group 
of children born to heroin-using 
mothers, Ornoy et al 
45 found that 
intellectual and learning abilities 
of children between ages 5 and 12 
who were raised from an early age 
in foster homes were significantly 
better than that of children who 
remained with heroin-dependent 
parents, but reduced performance

on intelligence testing persisted, 
suggesting that early life stressors 
were of great importance in future 
outcomes. Efforts to assess the 
impact of out-of-home care on 
children with NAS are warranted 
because almost 50% of NSW children 
of methadone-using mothers are 
removed from their biological 
parents at birth, and another 25% are 
removed by 5 years of age.42
Two mitigating factors against 
school failure were maternal age 
and parental education levels. 
Having an older mother (>30 years) 
and having a primary parent with 
high school education above grade 
9 or with some type of nonschool 
qualification significantly decreased 
the risk of failing to meet NMS, and 
this is a potentially modifiable public 
health factor. Encouraging women 
from high-risk families to extend 
education 
46 and delay their first 
pregnancy 
47 will be instrumental in 
improving childhood educational and 
health outcomes, even after biological 
risk factors such as prematurity are 
accounted for. 
46
Advantage must be taken of the 
fact that children with NAS can be 
identified from birth. Up to 16% of 
children have learning difficulties 
that are not identified before school, 
 
47 
and interventions are much more 
effective if they are instituted 
earlier. Campbell et al 
15 showed that 
early support of vulnerable African 
American infants from 6 weeks of 
age prolonged education (13·5 vs 
12·3 years), improved education 
achievements (more received a 
bachelor’s degree, 23% vs 6%), 
and increased employment rates 
(75% vs 53%) even at the age of 30. 
Furthermore, learning difficulties 
and other behavioral problems, such 
as attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder, are more common in 
children after intrauterine drug 
exposure, 
 
45 and these problems must 
be taken into consideration.
We were limited by the inability to 
verify the coding of NAS or to identify 
infants who were not medicated 
because doing so would have 
necessitated deidentification for a 
medical record review. We also chose 
to match on a priori variables known 
to be associated with poorer school 
outcomes but acknowledge that 
other strategies for matching, such as 
propensity score matching (PSM), are 
options to preprocess data for causal 
inference. In observational studies 
such as this, the data generation 
process is rarely standard or uniform, 
so attempts to use PSM may increase 
imbalance, inefficiency, model 
dependence, research discretion, and 
statistical bias in both real data and 
data that are generated to meet the 
requirements of PSM modeling. 
48 
For these reasons the PSM approach 
was rejected. Regardless, 1 of the 
strengths of our study is the high 
linkage rate; other studies have 
obtained data only from government 
schools and achieved linkage rates of 
<50%. 
26
CONCLUSIONS
To date these are the only data 
demonstrating long-term school 
outcomes for children with a history 
of NAS. Similar data for children born 
from the current opioid epidemic 
gripping much of the Northern 
Hemisphere, 
 
1 assuming linkage is 
possible, will be available only in 
7 to 10 years. Although this study 
was conducted in Australia, the high 
risk of poor academic performance 
in this vulnerable group of children 
is applicable to all countries, and 
strategies to address this risk and 
prevent poor adult outcomes and 
intergenerational vulnerability must 
be urgently addressed.
