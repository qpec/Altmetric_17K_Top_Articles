Drugs Cleared Through The FDA’s
Expedited Review Offer Greater
Gains Than Drugs Approved By
Conventional Process
ABSTRACT We investigated whether drugs approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) through expedited review have offered larger
health gains, compared to drugs approved through conventional review
processes. We identified published estimates of additional health gains
(measured in quality-adjusted life-years, or QALYs) associated with drugs
approved in the period 1999–2012 through expedited (seventy-six drugs)
versus conventional (fifty-nine) review processes. We found that drugs
in at least one expedited review program offered greater gains than
drugs reviewed through conventional processes (0.182 versus 0.003
QALYs). We also found that, compared to drugs not included in the same
program, greater gains were provided by drugs in the priority review
(0.175 versus 0.007 QALYs), accelerated approval (0.370 versus 0.031
QALYs), and fast track (0.254 versus 0.014 QALYs) programs. Our analysis
suggests that the FDA has prioritized drugs that offer the largest
health gains.
T
he Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) requires various phases of
testing to establish a drug’s safety
and efficacy before it can be mar-
keted in the United States.1 Howev-
er, when the FDA deems a drug to meet a partic-
ular unmet clinical need, it has the flexibility to
expedite its review. Four different programs of-
fer this flexibility for drugs meeting different
qualifying criteria: priority review, accelerated
approval, fast track, and breakthrough therapy.2
By focusing its resources on drugs believed to
offer the largest clinical advances or address the
most significant unmet needs, the FDA can en-
hance public health, increase regulatory efficien-
cy, and promote drug development.We assessed
the FDA’s record with these programs by exam-
ining whether drugs approved through them
have offered larger health gains than therapies
approved through conventional processes.
The 21st Century Cures Act, enacted in Decem-
ber 2016, contained various provisions intended
to speed FDA approvals. These provisions in-
clude additional expedited review programs to
further speed new medical technology to the
market. Opponents have raised concerns about
expanding the existing programs, fearing that
loosening
the
FDA’s
evidentiary
standards
would increase the likelihood that vulnerable
patient populations would be exposed to harm-
ful or ineffective drugs.3–5
In
light
of
the
added
expedited
review
programs, an understanding of how well the
existing programs are performing is valuable.
Because of the FDA’s experience with the previ-
ous expedited review programs—three of the
four were established more than two decades
ago—our hypothesis was that drugs in the pro-
grams have, on average, provided larger health
gains than drugs not in the programs. To com-
pare the clinical advances offered by drugs
included and those not included in expedited
review, we examined incremental health im-
provements measured by the additional quali-

 ty-adjusted life-years (QALYs) provided by a new
drug, compared to prevailing treatment options.
Study Data And Methods
We developed a data set of incremental QALY
gains associated with drugs the FDA included
in the expedited review programs and those
the FDA did not include.We used drug-indication
pairs as the unit of analysis. In other words,
when incremental QALY data were available for
a drug for multiple indications, each indication
was included separately in the data set.We previ-
ously used this data set and a similar methodo-
logical approach to compare the incremental
health gains associated with specialty and tradi-
tional drugs.6,7
The QALY is a standard metric of health that
accounts for both quality and length of life. One
QALY is equal to one year experienced in perfect
health. A year experienced in some degree of
impairment or disability is valued at a number
between zero and one, depending on the degree
of impairment. For example, four years lived
in perfect health equal four QALYs. Eight years
experienced with a quality of life of 0.5 per year is
also equal to four QALYs. We used QALYs as the
metric of health gain, as they facilitate compar-
isons of treatments indicated for different dis-
eases.8–10
Search Strategy And Data We identified all
new molecular entities—that is, drugs that had
not previously been approved by the FDA or mar-
keted in the United States—approved by the FDA
in the period 1999–2012 from the FDA’s database
of approved drug products.11 We used informa-
tion provided on the FDA’s website to classify
each drug with respect to its inclusion in the
priority review, accelerated approval, and fast
track programs.12–15 We excluded drugs in the
breakthrough therapy program because it was
implementedin 2012. Because of thelagbetween
drug approval and publication of cost-utility an-
alyses, we did not include drugs approved after
2012.16
For each drug, we searched the PubMed data-
base for cost-effectiveness analyses reporting
a cost per QALY gained (cost-utility analyses)
and for comparative effectiveness studies that
compared the benefits and risks of competing
treatments in terms of QALYs. We searched this
database using the drug’s brand and chemical
names and the search term quality-adjusted life
year OR quality-adjusted life-year OR QALY. We
restricted our search to studies involving human
participants and published in English-language
journals.
We included studies that evaluated drugs for
their labeled indication or indications and that
compared the drugs with prevailing treatment
options available at the time of FDA approval.
We excluded studies that evaluated the drug of
interest for an off-label indication; included
comparator treatments that were unavailable
on the date of its FDA approval; or, in our judg-
ment, did not compare the drug to an appropri-
ate active treatment—that is, the included com-
parator treatment was a placebo or no treatment,
despite the availability of an active comparator.
For each study, we considered the investigators’
reasoning
for
their
choice
of
comparator
treatments—forexample, whether it represented
prevailing clinical practice or was consistent
with current treatment guidelines.
Because evidence suggests that pharmaceuti-
cal industry sponsorship may influence cost-
utility study findings,17,18 we categorized each
study according to its source of funding: whether
it was funded by a non-industry source; was
sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry; or
was unfunded. To be conservative, we included
only unfunded studies and studies funded by
non-industry sources.
Also to be conservative, when a study com-
pared the drug of interest to multiple alterna-
tives, we selected as the comparator the most
effective intervention available at the time of
FDA approval—that is, the comparator treat-
ment with the largest reported QALY gain. For
example, one study compared the drug of inter-
est (adefovir, a drug the FDA approved in 2002
for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B) to four
alternatives: best supportive care, lamivudine
(approved in 1995), subcutaneous or conven-
tional interferon-α (1998), and pegylated inter-
feron α-2a (2005).19 Of the drugs available before
the FDA approved adefovir, lamivudine was
estimated to be most effective (it offered 18.08
QALYs compared to adefovir’s 19.15 QALYs). We
therefore used a QALYgain of 1.07 for adefovir in
our data set.
QALY Gains We used the included cost-effec-
tiveness and comparative-effectiveness studies
to develop the data set of incremental QALYgains
associated with each drug. When the FDA had
approved a drug for multiple indications, we
considered each indication separately (as noted
above). For example, we identified incremental
QALY gain estimates for dabigatran for two in-
dications: reducing the risk of stroke in patients
with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and treating
deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embo-
lism. The FDA first approved dabigatran in 2010
for patients with atrial fibrillation and included
the drug in the priority review program. It sub-
sequently approved dabigatran in 2014 for treat-
ment of deep venous thrombosis, which was not
in an expedited review program.

 We included estimates of incremental QALY
gains reported in each study’s base-case analysis
in the data set.When the study reported multiple
incremental QALY gain estimates in the base
case—such as estimates pertaining to different
time horizons or patient populations—we calcu-
lated a mean estimate from the different sce-
narios.Forexample,Mari Elshout and coauthors
compared aflibercept to alternatives for the
treatment of age-related macular degeneration
using two time horizons (five and two years) in
base-case analyses.20 In these situations, we cal-
culated the mean of the reported values to assign
a single estimate of incremental QALY gain for
each study.
When we identified multiple studies that met
our inclusion criteria, we applied an equal
weight to each study to calculate an aggregate
estimate of incremental QALYgain. For example,
if a drug was associated with three studies, we
assigned a weight of one-third to each study es-
timate.
Analysis We compared incremental QALY
gains for drug-indication pairs reviewed through
the conventional process—that is, they were not
in any expedited review program—with the gains
for pairs in at least one program. We then com-
pared incremental QALY gains for drug-indica-
tion pairs in a single program with the gains for
pairs in two or more expedited review programs.
We compared incremental QALY gains using
Mann-Whitney U tests (to compare median val-
ues of the different distributions) and Kolmo-
gorov-Smirnov tests (to compare the shape of
the different distributions). We used these non-
parametric statistical tests because the number
of drugs with high QALY gains skewed the data
set.
In a second set of analyses, we examined each
expedited review program separately, using the
same statistical tests to compare incremental
QALY gains for drug-indication pairs in the ex-
pedited review program versus pairs not in the
program.
In sensitivity analyses, we repeated each of the
above analyses using first the highest and then
the lowest reported estimates of incremental
QALY gains for each drug-indication pair. Fur-
thermore, because a preponderance of orphan
drugs in our sample was included in at least one
expedited review program, we repeated the an-
alyses with orphan drugs excluded in a second
sensitivity analysis.
In supplementary analyses, we examined
whether the QALYdifferential between drugs in-
cluded in the expedited review programs and
those not included had changed from 1999 to
2012. We used univariate regression to conduct
these analyses.
Limitations Our study had a number of
limitations. An important one is that because
estimates of incremental QALY gains were not
available for all of the drugs the FDA approved
over the study period, our sample might not be
fully representative. As noted above, because of
the lag between drug approval and publication of
cost-utility analyses, we did not include drugs
approved after 2012.16
A second limitation is that the included cost-
utility analyses are likely subject to some degree
of publication bias—that is, they tend to report
favorable
cost-effectiveness
ratios
and
thus
favorable incremental QALYgain estimates.18 Be-
cause drugs approved through the accelerated
approval program are approved based on surro-
gate endpoints, a drug’s true efficacy is unknown
before the results of the required confirmatory
studies are available. Furthermore, surrogate
endpoints in some areas, such as oncologic tri-
als, have been shown to have poor correlation
with outcomes such as survival.21 Accordingly,
cost-utility studies that use surrogate endpoints
to estimate QALY gains should be considered
with caution.
Third, the included published studies varied
with respect to methodology, country, perspec-
tive, and other attributes.22–24 Because we relied
on the reported mean QALY gains from each
study, we did not account for heterogeneity of
treatment effects—that is, the fact that some pa-
tients will benefit from the drug more than
others will.
Fourth, while QALYs facilitate comparison of
the health gains offered by drugs across indica-
tions, they might not adequately capture all of
the benefits and harms associated with prod-
ucts.8,9 Fifth, our study did not account for safety
concerns associated with the included drugs that
became apparent after the cost-utility analyses
that contributed estimates of incremental QALY
gain to our data set were published.
Sixth, because the aim of this study was to
quantify the additional health benefits of new
drugs compared to prevailing treatment options,
the choice of comparator treatments was integral
to our research. For drugs with multiple contrib-
uting studies, the comparator varied across
studies on occasion. However, we mitigated this
limitation by selecting from studies with multi-
ple comparators the most effective comparator
available at the time the drug of interest was
introduced.
Seventh, unlike previous research that has ex-
amined the association of various drugattributes
with FDA approval time—for example, the num-
ber of previous drugs approved by the FDA in the
same class—we did not examine the attributes of
the drugs included in the expedited review

 programs.25
Despite these limitations, given the strengths
of the data noted above, and the conservative
assumptions, this research should provide in-
sight into whether drugs that the FDA prioritizes
with expedited review offer larger health gains.
Study Results
Four different FDA programs offer flexibility
in approving drugs that meet different criteria
(Exhibit 1). Priority review (for drugs that target
serious conditions and offer significant improve-
ments over existing care) has a six-month review
window, compared with the ten-month stan-
dard. Accelerated approval (for drugs that pro-
vide meaningful clinical advancement for seri-
ous
conditions
and
for
which
effects
on
intermediate endpoints are reasonably likely to
predict clinical benefit) offers approval based on
intermediate endpoints but comes with postap-
proval requirements to extend results from sur-
rogate to clinical outcome. Fast track designa-
tion (for drugs for serious conditions that
demonstrate the potential to address unmet
needs) provides the possibility of a “rolling re-
view” application and more frequent interaction
with the FDA to expedite the review process.
Breakthrough therapy (for drugs that target se-
rious conditions and for which preliminary evi-
dence indicates substantial improvement over
existing therapies) offers rolling review and in-
tensive guidance on efficient drug development.
We identified at least one appropriate QALY
gain estimate for 118 drugs across a range of
disease categories (see online Appendix Exhib-
its 1–3),26 roughly 30 percent of the new molecu-
lar entities approved by the FDA in the period
1999–2012.11 Ourdata set contained 66 of the 166
drugs the FDA included in the priority review
program, 16 of the 41 drugs in the accelerated
approval program, and 30 of the 79 drugs in the
fast track program in the study period.
In total, we analyzed 135 drug-indication
pairs. Sixty-eight were in the priority review pro-
gram, thirty-one in the fast track program, and
seventeen in the accelerated approval program.
Thirty were in multiple programs, and 59 were
in none.
Thirty-nine drug-indication pairs in our data
set (29 percent) were estimated to be no more
effective or less effective than existing care—that
is, they had zero or negative incremental QALYs.
This was the case for twenty-four pairs (40.7 per-
cent) reviewed through conventional processes
and fifteen pairs (19.7 percent) in at least one

The results of sensitivity analyses in which we
included the highest and lowest reported esti-
mates of incremental QALY gains were qualita-
tively the same as our primary findings in terms
of the significance, sign, and order of magnitude
(Appendix Exhibit 7).26 Similarly, the results of
the sensitivity analyses that excluded orphan
drugs from the data set did not differ meaning-
fully from the main study findings (Appendix

Discussion
We found that drugs in at least one expedited
review program were associated with larger
QALY gains than drugs reviewed through con-
ventional processes. We also found that drugs
in multiple expedited review programs were
associated with larger QALY gains, compared
to drugs in a single program. Additionally, we
found that drugs in the priority review, fast
track, and acceleratedapproval programstended
to be associated with larger QALY gains than
drugs not included in them. These findings sug-
gest that the FDA has prioritized the review of
drugs offering the largest clinical advancements
over existing care by including them in the vari-
ous expedited review programs. However, be-
cause QALY gain estimates were not available
for all FDA-approved drugs, our findings should
be interpreted with caution.
Each expedited review program has different
criteria, but it is unclear whether these differenc-
es would result in drugs in one program being
associated with larger QALYgains than drugs in a
different program. In future research, we plan to
investigate this point and examine the possible
reasons for any identified differences.
Encouraging innovation to address unmet
health needs is a long-standing priority for
health policy makers. The FDA’s various expedit-
ed review programs are important regulatory
levers and respond to the growing call for more
rapid access to new drugs. Easing the path to-
ward innovation is a worthy goal, but the key
question is how the initiatives will improve
health outcomes. The FDA’s record with policies
to expedite the approval of drugs that address a
particular unmet clinical need or that provide a

 significant improvement in safety or effective-
ness over available therapies is instructive in this
regard.
Our analysis provides policy makers with new
information about the performance of existing
expedited programs and an empirical context for
considering the appropriateness of introducing
additional programs. To be sure, our analysis
does not capture all of the factors the FDA must
consider. Drugs subject to shorter reviews are
more likely to be withdrawn for safety reasons,
for example, and to carry subsequent black-box
warnings.27
In one high-profile example, the FDA ap-
proved bevacizumab for metastatic breast cancer
in the accelerated approval program in 2008,
only to withdraw the expanded approval later
when new data showed that the drug did not
improve survival rates for this indication.28 In
another example, the FDA approved ponatinib—
a drug in the priority review, accelerated approv-
al, and fast track programs—for chronic myelog-
enous leukemia, only later to temporarily with-
draw the drug from the market because of
reports that patients were experiencing great-
er-than-expected adverse events.29
Furthermore, for drugs in the accelerated ap-
proval program, the FDA has had limited success
in ensuring that mandated postapproval trials to
validate the findings from surrogate endpoints
are performed in a timely manner.30 For exam-
ple, in 1996 the FDA approved midodrine under
the accelerated approval program for the treat-
ment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension,
but trials verifying actual clinical benefit to
patients were not completed.31 Nevertheless, be-
cause drugs in the expedited review programs
have the potential to treat severe diseases and
address unmet medical needs, physicians and
patients may be willing to accept a greater degree
of risk.32,33
While it is challenging to predict how the 21st
Century Cures Act will affect product safety, our
findings offer another input into the complex
debate surrounding the act as the country
embarks on a new era of expedited review and
approval. The act added a range of initiatives
intended to streamline the regulatory process
(among them, proposals to allow for greater
flexibility in clinical trial design) and to better
incorporate patients’ preferences in the FDA’s
decision-making process. The legislation also
adds a new pathway for “regenerative advanced
therapy”—including cell therapy, therapeutic
tissue engineering products, and human cell
and tissue products—antibacterial and antifun-
gal drugs for use in a limited population of pa-
tients and a new priority review program for
medical devices. Other provisions expand the
use of accelerated approval (which is based on
surrogate endpoints) beyond drugs intended to
treat patients with life-threatening illnesses and
unmet needs.
The law has alarmed some observers, who are
concerned that expanding the expedited review
programs will lower the regulatory standard and
undermine the FDA’s role of ensuring that ap-
proved drugs are safe and effective.34 These ob-
servers have argued that the FDA already reviews
and approves the majority of drugs faster than is
the case with regulators in other countries, and
that the benefits of sending drugs to the market
even faster may not outweigh the risks of doing
so.35,36 Furthermore, in 2016, sixteen of the twen-
ty-two (73 percent) approved novel drugs werein
at least one expedited review program: fifteen
(68 percent of the twenty-two drugs) in the pri-
ority review, eight (36 percent) in the fast track,
six (27 percent) in the accelerated approval, and
7 (32 percent) in the breakthrough therapy pro-
gram.37 Further expanding the expedited review
programs could have the effect of making expe-
dited review the standard rather than the excep-
tion for FDA review and lead to questions of
whether the FDA is efficiently channeling limit-
ed resources to the most promising treatments.
Greater scrutiny of the expedited review pro-
grams is warranted going forward.
Expedited review programs offer the FDA
greater discretion for hastening the delivery of
highly promising and much-needed treatments
to patients and for providing incentives for phar-
maceutical innovation. However, the key will be
to maintain an appropriate balance of benefits
and risks to improve population health.
Conclusion
Our comparison of the QALY gains of drugs in
the FDA’s expedited review programs and the
gains of those not in the programs suggests that,
at least for the products in our sample, the FDA
has prioritized drugs that offer the largest
health gains. ▪
