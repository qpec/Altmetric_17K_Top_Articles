ith aging, the aorta stiffens and pressure pulsatility 
increases, inducing hemodynamic changes implicated 
in the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD).1,2 
Recent analyses from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) 
and other cohorts suggest that, in older individuals, vascular 
remodeling may also play a central role in the development 
of structural brain injury,3,4 which have been associated with 
reduced cognitive ability5–7 and increased likelihood of inci-
dent dementia.8
The earliest differences in brain structure associated with 
increased pulsatility, however, have yet to be determined, and 
it is possible that differences could be identified even earlier in 
life, before symptomatic disease expression, should a suitably 
sized cohort and sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
measures be available. The FHS Third Generation (G3) is 
ideal to test this hypothesis as participants were recruited at an 
early age and were 40 years of age on average at the time of 
this study. Despite the relatively young age of this cohort, sen-
sitive measures of white-matter (WM) injury from diffusion 
tensor imaging (DTI) identified subtle vascular brain injury 
in association with elevated systolic blood pressure,9 suggest-
ing that newer imaging techniques may be able to identify 
clinically silent structural brain differences in association with 
hemodynamic metrics.
Our aim was to extend our preliminary findings by explor-
ing associations between tonometry measures and regional 
Background and Purpose—Previous work from the Framingham Heart Study suggests that brain changes because of 
arterial aging may begin in young adulthood and that such changes precede cognitive deficits. The objective of this study 
was to determine the association of arterial stiffness with measures of white matter and gray matter (GM) integrity in 
young adults.
Methods—One thousand nine hundred three participants from the Framingham Heart Study Third Generation (mean age, 
46±8.7 years) had complete tonometry measurements and brain magnetic resonance imaging (T1-weighted and diffusion 
tensor imaging). Tonometry measures included carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, carotid-
brachial pressure amplification, and central pulse pressure. Fractional anisotropy and GM density images were computed 
from diffusion tensor imaging and T1 images. Registration to a common anatomic template enabled voxel-based linear 
regressions relating measures of fractional anisotropy and GM to tonometry measures, adjusting for relevant covariables.
Results—Higher carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity was associated with lower regional fractional anisotropy, including 
the corpus callosum and the corona radiata (8.7 and 8.6 cc, respectively, P<0.001), as well as lower GM density in the 
thalamus region (0.9 cc, P<0.001). Analyses did not reveal significant associations between other tonometry measures 
and fractional anisotropy or GM.
Conclusions—Among young healthy adults, higher aortic stiffness was associated with measures of reduced white matter 
and GM integrity in areas implicated in cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease. Greater aortic stiffness may result 
in subclinical vascular brain injury at ages much younger than previously described.

white matter injury as estimated by DTI-derived fractional 
anisotropy (FA) and gray matter (GM) atrophy in G3 partici-
pants. We postulated that increased arterial stiffness would be 
associated with lower FA and GM density, which would sug-
gest that arterial stiffness can lead to vascular brain injury as 
early as the fifth decade of life.
Methods
Study Sample
The design of the Framingham G3 Cohort study has been detailed 
previously.10 Of the 3519 participants who attended examination 2, 
2034 underwent brain MRI between 2009 and 2013 and had suc-
cessful arterial tonometry measures. Participants were excluded from 
the present analysis for the following reasons: prevalent stroke at the 
MRI evaluation, other neurological disorders that might confound the 
assessment of brain volumes, because of bad or incomplete tonom-
etry data or poor MRI quality, resulting in a sample of 1903 indi-
viduals. All protocols were approved by Boston University Medical 
Center’s institutional review board, and participants provided written 
informed consent.
Clinical Evaluation and Definitions
Medical history, physical examination, and ECG were performed 
routinely at each FHS examination. Blood pressures represent the 
average of 2 auscultatory blood pressures obtained by the physician 
on seated participants at the time of each Framingham clinic exami-
nation with the use of a standardized measurement protocol.
Tonometry Data Acquisition and Analysis
Noninvasive hemodynamic data acquisition is described in the 
online-only Data Supplement. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) 
was calculated by integration of the calibrated brachial pressure 
waveform. Central pulse pressure (CPP) was defined as the differ-
ence between the peak and trough of the calibrated carotid pres-
sure waveform. Augmentation index (AI) was computed from the 
carotid pressure waveform as described previously.11 Briefly, AI is 
the augmentation pressure divided by pulse pressure, expressed as 
a percentage. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (CFPWV) val-
ues were calculated from tonometry waveforms and body surface 
transit distance, which were adjusted for parallel transmission in 
the brachiocephalic artery and aortic arch with the use of the supra-
sternal notch as a fiducial point.12 The carotid-femoral transit path 
spans the descending aorta, making CFPWV a measure of aortic 
stiffness.
Brain MRI Analysis
We used DTI measures of FA, which is a sensitive indicator of WM 
integrity.13 FA was computed from DTI using FSL software tools.14 
Segmentation of GM, WM, and total cranial volume were performed 
from T1-weighted and FLAIR images by automated procedures 
previously described.15 FA and GM maps were finally coregistered 
to a minimal deformation template16,17 for group statistical analyses 
(online-only Data Supplement).
Statistical Analyses
Voxel-Based Regressions of FA and GM With 
Components of Hemodynamic Load
The primary goal of the statistical analysis was to determine if, at 
the image voxel level, individual key components of hemodynamic 
load (CFPWV, AI, CPP, and MAP) were associated with greater brain 
injury as indicated by lower FA or GM atrophy adjusting for a set of 
CVD risk factors. To achieve this goal, we used a linear regression 
(model 1) with either measures of FA or GM density as the depen-
dent variable and each of the 4 components as independent variables, 
adjusting for a reference set of standard risk factors including age, 
sex, use of antihypertensive therapy, total cholesterol, current smok-
ing status, presence of diabetes mellitus, total cranial volume, and 
time between clinical and MRI exams. CFPWV was inverted o 
reduce heteroscedasticity and normalize the distribution; the value 
was multiplied by −1000 to convert units to milliseconds per meter 
and restore directionality of effects.
In a second model (model 2), we then tested whether rela-
tions of CFPWV, AI, CPP, and MAP with FA and GM may be 
modulated by age, sex, and antihypertensive treatment therapy. 
We assessed this goal by performing regressions as described in 
model 1, including additional interactions of the component of 
hemodynamic load with the 3 covariates, ie, age, sex, and antihy-
pertensive therapy.
The T-map obtained for each comparison was evaluated for sta-
tistical significance using threshold free cluster enhancement at the 
P<0.05 level (online-only Data Supplement) and corrected for mul-
tiple comparison using permutation-based correction (N=1000).18 
We then overlaid the thresholded T-maps with the Johns Hopkins 
University probabilistic fiber map atlases19 and GM atlas, warped 
to the minimal deformation template space, to provide a post hoc 
regional description of significant voxels in terms of the WM tracts 
and GM structures to which they most likely belonged. For each sig-
nificant region, the mean FA (respectively mean GM density) was 
computed for each person by superimposing the mask of the corre-
sponding region to each individual’s FA (respectively GM) images. 
This enabled us to perform linear regressions as described above but 
at region level.
Modulation of Hemodynamic Load Components 
Effects by Other Components
To determine whether significant regional relations between 1 hemo-
dynamic component and FA or GM were mediated in part by the 
other hemodynamic variables, we performed, for that component, 
region-based level regressions as described in model 1, including in 
addition the other hemodynamic variables as covariates.
Accelerated White Matter Aging Related to 
Hemodynamic Load Components
We computed the mean FA within regions identified in the voxel-
based analyses as significantly associated with hemodynamic load 
components to be used as the dependent variable in a linear regres-
sion. The tonometry measures were categorized into 3 groups (higher, 
intermediate and lower tertile intervals), and used as the independent 
variable, adjusting for the reference set of standard risk factors. 
Because the mean FA measure appeared to be quadratically related 
to age on visual inspection (Figure 1A), we also created a model that 
included the quadratic effect of age.
Results
Demographics
Compared with the remainder of the G3 cohort (Table) with-
out MRI, individuals included in this study were on aver-
age significantly younger (P=0.02) with significantly lower 
systolic blood pressure (P<0.001), CFPWV (P=0.008), AI 
(P=0.016), MAP (P=0.007), and CPP (P=0.036). In addition, 
they were less likely to smoke (P=0.004) to receive treat-
ment for hypertension (P=0.007) or have diabetes mellitus 
(P=0.006).

In model 1, higher CFPWV was associated with lower FA 
within voxels that covered 25.5 cc of the WM (Table I in the

online-only Data Supplement). WM tracts most implicated 
included the splenium, body, and genu of corpus callosum 
region (2.77, 3.78, and 2.05 cc, respectively) and the anterior, 
superior, and posterior part of the corona radiata (4.13, 2.55, 
and 1.86 cc, respectively, Figure 2A).
Higher CFPWV was also associated with lower GM density 
but within voxels that covered only 0.93 cc of the GM (Table I 
in the online-only Data Supplement), implicating the thalamic 
region (Figure 2B).
Figure 3 illustrates regression curves relating CFPWV with 
the mean FA and mean GM density, within the respective sig-
nificant voxels for the largest identified regions.
Voxel-based analyses did not reveal significant association 
between FA and GM with MAP, AI, or CPP measures.

Modulation of Hemodynamic Load Associations 
by Sex and Antihypertensive Treatment
Model 2 revealed a significant interaction between CFPWV 
and age on FA (Figure 4A) with increasing age being asso-
ciated with a larger negative relation of CFPWV with FA 
measures within voxels that covered 9.22 cc of the WM. 
WM tracts most affected included the anterior corona radi-
ata (3.44 cc) and the external capsule (1.19 cc, Table II in 
the online-only Data Supplement). The model also revealed 
a significant interaction of CFPWV with antihyperten-
sive treatment therapy, indicating an attenuated relation of 
CFPWV with FA in individuals receiving antihypertensive 
treatment when compared with individuals with no treat-
ment. This modeled interaction implicated voxels that cov-
ered 0.86 cc of the WM, mostly in the posterior corona 
radiata region (0.53 cc, Figure 4B and Table II in the online-
only Data Supplement).
Similar analysis of relations of CFPWV with GM density at 
voxel-based level failed to find any significant effects.
Finally, the lack of significant associations between FA and 
GM with MAP, AI, and CPP was not found to be modulated 
by age, sex, or antihypertensive treatment.
Modulation of Hemodynamic Load 
Components Effects by Other Components
Adding MAP, AI, and CPP as covariates in model 1 with 
CFPWV as variable of interest and regional FA and GM mea-
sures as dependent variables did not significantly change the 
association between CFPWV and FA and GM (Table I in the 
online-only Data Supplement).

CFPWV tertile intervals were T1=[4.3; 6.3], T2=[6.3; 7.3], 
and T3=[7.3; 18.8] (m/s). On average, WM integrity (ie, mean 
FA) was found to be negatively associated with CFPWV ter-
tile groups (P=0.016). Post hoc analyses, corrected for mul-
tiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction, revealed that 
individuals of T3 group had, on average, lower FA when com-
pared with T2 (β=−2.6×10-3, P=0.037) and T1 (β=−3.4×10−3,

P=0.013) groups. Mean FA was not found to differ between 
the T1 and T2 groups (P=0.88). WM integrity was found to 
decrease with increasing age in an accelerating fashion as evi-
denced by significant linear and quadratic terms (β=−8.3×10−4, 
P<0.001 and β=−1.2×10−5, P=0.012, respectively, Figure 1A), 
independently of CFPWV (P=0.64 and P=0.33 for linear and 
quadratic interactions, respectively).
Figure 1B illustrates differences in WM integrity between 
CFPWV groups as a function of age. For example, the WM 
integrity of a 40-year-old individual with CFPWV in the 
higher range (T3) corresponded to that of a T2 group 1.3 years 
older, whereas this difference for T1 group was 5.4 years.
Discussion
Results from this study indicated that, among a sample of young 
to middle-aged adults representative of the community, CFPWV, 
the reference standard noninvasive measure of aortic stiffness, 
was associated with injury to WM and regional GM atrophy 
that worsened continuously with increasing CFPWV. Such 
associations were found to be accentuated by age and attenu-
ated by antihypertensive treatment. A second finding was that, 
in our community-based sample, CPP, AI, and MAP were not 
associated with measures of WM and GM integrity. These data 
indicate that cerebral microvascular damage and brain atrophy, 
associated with elevated aortic stiffness, which has been recently 
found to manifest in subclinical cognitive dysfunction4 in the 
FHS Offspring cohort (mean±SD age: 61±9 years old), is pres-
ent and discernable even among younger individuals.
Biological Mechanisms
The biological mechanisms triggered by increased arterial 
stiffness are complex. With aging, stiffening of the large 
arteries causes aortic systolic blood pressure to increase, which 
contributes to loading of stiff components of the arterial wall 
and subsequently further increases arterial stiffness. Structural 
changes that increase aortic stiffness are precipitated by a pro-
gressive increase in collagen, ground substance, and calcium 
deposition, coupled with the degradation and fragmentation of 
elastin fibers.20 These irregular physical forces in the arteries 
trigger atherogenic, hypertrophic and inflammatory responses 
in small vessels that may contribute to reduce microvascular 
reactivity. Arterial stiffness may contribute to microvascular 
brain injury by exposing the small vessels of the cerebral vas-
culature to high pressure fluctuations and flow pulsatility.21 
Central artery stiffness may also increase short-term vari-
ability in blood pressure, which, in the presence of impaired 
microvascular reactivity, may impact supply of oxygen and 
nutrients to the brain.22 The impact of the reduction in micro-
vascular reactivity on the cross-talk between large and small 
arteries may also play a role in brain injury,23,24 with the cross-
talk between increased stiffness in large arteries and related 
microvascular dysfunction resulting in increased susceptibil-
ity to intermittent hypotension and relative ischemia, particu-
larly in the periventricular WM watershed region.25
Impact of Arterial Stiffness on 
White Matter Integrity
Abnormal elevations in central and cerebral hemodynamic 
pulsatility promote the development of white matter hyper-
intensities (WMH) and lacunar infarcts and increase the risk 
for a first CVD event.1,26 In particular, the association between 
central artery stiffness and WMH burden has been frequently 
and consistently reported among older individuals.3,4,27 In 
the FHS Offspring cohort of older individuals, recent find-
ings suggest that only CFPWV and MAP are associated with 
WMH burden. But recent DTI studies suggest that WMH may 
only represent the extreme foci of a more widespread, con-
tinuous WM injury process that progresses insidiously during 
aging,13,28 suggesting that subtle aortic stiffness-related brain 
injury may occur before evident injury events, like WMH, 
occur, even when the overall vascular burden is low. This 
hypothesis is supported by the present work using DTI in a 
young adult sample, wherein we found continuous associa-
tions between CFPWV and microstructural WM injury in sev-
eral tracts (particularly the corpus callosum) that have been 
reported to be affected in elderly people with Alzheimer dis-
ease.29 Our finding also extends observations from a recent 
tract-based spatial statistic DTI study3 that identified similar 
associations in a sample of 55 older individuals. Despite the 
fact that voxel-based and tract-based studies are 2 methods 
using a fairly different approach, both the prior study and the 
current data identified the corpus callosum, corona radiata, 
and internal capsule as regions that are particularly vulnerable 
to increased aortic stiffness.
Impact of Arterial Stiffness on GM Integrity
Our study also suggests a localized impact of CFPWV on GM 
integrity exclusively in the bilateral thalamic regions, covering 
only 0.9 cc, and may be explained by the location and blood 
supply of this region.30 At regional level, 1 study examined 
Figure 4. Regions of the cerebral white matter in which an interac-
tion between carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity with age (A) and 
antihypertensive treatment (B) was significantly associated with 
fractional anisotropy. Cold and warm scales indicate P value corre-
sponding to negative and positive associations, respectively.

correlation between CFPWV and regional cerebral perfusion, 
using arterial spin labeling, within GM regions including hip-
pocampus, thalamus, and caudate nucleus in 35 middle-aged 
adults31 but did not find evidence of significant associations of 
CFPWV with any of the GM structures. Although the ability 
of this study to detect associations may have been hindered 
by low statistical power, a potential hypothesis explaining the 
lack of associations is that the impact of arterial stiffness on 
GM integrity may be slow, subtle, and hardly perceptible dur-
ing early and midadult life, but exacerbated later in the aging 
process, suggesting that cortical atrophy may be the end stage 
of advanced vascular disease. Longitudinal analysis of the 
effect of CFPWV on GM integrity may clarify this issue.
Implications of Hypertension Treatment
There is now substantial evidence that elevated arterial stiff-
ness is the earliest manifestation of systolic hypertension.32 
For example, in the FHS, the baseline measure of CFPWV 
was found to be strongly associated with incident hyperten-
sion.33 However, after controlling for baseline measure of 
CFPWV, no blood pressure component (systolic, diastolic, 
or mean) entered the model for future stiffness, supporting 
the hypothesis that aortic stiffness may antedate and contrib-
ute to the development of hypertension.32 This hypothesis is 
also supported by recent basic and clinical studies that find 
associations between altered CFPWV, through the disruption 
of elastin in the aortic wall, and subsequent development of 
hypertension.34 Finally, it should be noted that results from 
studies that seek to show that elevation in blood pressure pre-
cedes increase in CFPWV, are more controversial.32 Arterial 
stiffness, which is easily measurable, may therefore serve to 
identify individuals at greatest risk of hypertension progres-
sion. Our results find that treated hypertension is associated 
with more normal CFPWV values. This finding suggests that 
the elastic nature of the aortic vasculature may be more resil-
ient and amenable at younger ages indicating that early life 
treatment of hypertension may be substantially more benefi-
cial. Such a hypothesis deserves further testing.
Absence of Association Between Brain 
Integrity Measures and AI, CPP, and MAP
Overall, our findings do not suggest significant relations of 
AI and CPP with WM and GM integrity. Previous work from 
the FHS has identified CFPWV as a significant predictor of a 
first major CVD event.1 In contrast, neither carotid-radial pulse 
wave velocity, AI, nor CPP were related to CVD events in risk 
factor–adjusted models that included peripheral systolic blood 
pressure. Thus, CFPWV may be superior to other hemodynamic 
measures as a marker of risk that is distinct from standard vas-
cular risk factors; the present analysis suggests that attention 
should be focused on aortic pulse wave velocity as a biomarker 
of microstructural WM integrity, even in younger individuals.
Strengths and Limitations
The cross-sectional design limits our ability to establish 
causal relations between arterial stiffness and brain aging 
measures. In addition, the FHS cohort is mostly of white 
descent and therefore does not fully represent the general 
population of the USA. Third, we referred to our sample as 
an adult healthy population although 73 participants were 
60 years old and older. Nonetheless, excluding these older 
participants from the analyses did not change significantly 
the findings reported in the present study. Fourth, we did not 
include systolic blood pressure in our regression analyses 
to avoid introducing collinearity in the models. Similarly, 
we did not include measures of dietary or exercise, which 
both have been found to have beneficial effects on cogni-
tion,35 as recent studies have reported a significant impact of 
these nondrug interventions on arterial stiffness by several 
mechanisms.36
Conclusions
In conclusion, CFPWV, a noninvasive measure of arterial 
stiffness, was associated with deterioration of WM integ-
rity in young to middle-aged adults likely years before overt 
WMH seem. With the accumulating evidence that arterial 
stiffness impacts the trajectory of cognition later in life, the 
public health implications of our results emphasize the need 
for primary and secondary prevention of vascular stiffness 
and remodeling as early as the fifth decade. Use of tonometric 
measures may provide a relatively simple measure to iden-
tify higher risk young individuals who may most benefit from 
hypertension or other vascular risk factor treatment.
