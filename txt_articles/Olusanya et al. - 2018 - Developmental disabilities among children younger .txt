Developmental disabilities among children younger than 
5 years in 195 countries and territories, 1990–2016: 
a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 
2016
Global Research on Developmental Disabilities Collaborators*
Summary
Background The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) mandate systematic monitoring of the health and wellbeing 
of all children to achieve optimal early childhood development. However, global epidemiological data on children 
with developmental disabilities are scarce. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 
provides a comprehensive assessment of prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) for development disabilities 
among children younger than 5 years in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016.
Methods We estimated prevalence and YLDs for epilepsy, intellectual disability, hearing loss, vision loss, autism 
spectrum disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. YLDs were estimated as the product of the prevalence 
estimate and the disability weight for each mutually exclusive disorder, corrected for comorbidity. We used 
DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, on a pool of primary data derived from systematic reviews of the 
literature, health surveys, hospital and claims databases, cohort studies, and disease-specific registries.
Findings Globally, 52·9 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 48·7–57·3; or 8·4% [7·7–9·1]) children younger than 
5 years (54% males) had developmental disabilities in 2016 compared with 53·0 million (49·0–57·1; or 8·9% [8·2–9·5]) 
in 1990. About 95% of these children lived in low-income and middle-income countries. YLDs among these children 
increased from 3·8 million (95% UI 2·8–4·9) in 1990 to 3·9 million (2·9–5·2) in 2016. These disabilities accounted 
for 13·3% of the 29·3 million YLDs for all health conditions among children younger than 5 years in 2016. Vision loss 
was the most prevalent disability, followed by hearing loss, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder. 
However, intellectual disability was the largest contributor to YLDs in both 1990 and 2016. Although the prevalence of 
developmental disabilities among children younger than 5 years decreased in all countries (except for North America) 
between 1990 and 2016, the number of children with developmental disabilities increased significantly in 
sub-Saharan Africa (71·3%) and in North Africa and the Middle East (7·6%). South Asia had the highest prevalence 
of children with developmental disabilities in 2016 and North America had the lowest.
Interpretation The global burden of developmental disabilities has not significantly improved since 1990, suggesting 
inadequate global attention on the developmental potential of children who survived childhood as a result of child 
survival programmes, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. The SDGs provide a framework for policy 
and action to address the needs of children with or at risk of developmental disabilities, particularly in resource-poor 
countries.

Introduction
Early childhood, commonly defined as the first 5 years of 
life, is the fastest period of growth and the period in 
which the developing brain is most sensitive to 
stimulation and nurturing.1 This period of development 
is regarded as the foundation for subsequent educational 
and vocational attainment at the individual level, and for 
overall human capital and economic development at the 
population level.2 The UN’s Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs) focused largely on reducing under-5 
mortality, especially in low-income and middle-income 
countries (LMICs).3 By contrast, the UN’s Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) from 2015 to 2030 envision 
improvements in the broader health status of children 
beyond survival.4,5 Alongside the general recognition of 
people with disabilities in several of the SDGs, SDG 4 
specifically requires actions to monitor the proportion of 
children younger than 5 years who are achieving their 
developmental potential in health, education, and 
psychosocial wellbeing, disaggregated by disability, age, 
sex, geographic location, and other characteristics.
Developmental disabilities are a group of conditions 
resulting from impairments that affect a child’s physical, 
learning, or behavioural functioning.6 Affected children

typically have sensory impairments (hearing and vision 
loss), epilepsy or seizures, cerebral palsy, attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD), intellectual disability, or other learning disorders.7 
Children with developmental delays and disabilities are at 
greater risk of suboptimal health, educational attainment, 
and wellbeing than are children without such disabilities.8 
However, epidemiological data on developmental dis-
abilities to guide comprehensive health policy engage-
ments at global, regional, and national levels are scarce.9 
The most widely reported data to date suggest that roughly 
250 million children are at risk of suboptimal development 
in LMICs.10,11 However, this number is based solely on 
children thought to be at risk of poor development because 
of stunting or extreme poverty and does not fully capture 
children with developmental disabilities.10 Another study12 
based on UNICEF’s Early Childhood Development Index 
estimated that 80·8 million children aged 3 or 4 years in 
LMICs had low cognitive or socioemotional development 
in 2010. That study was limited by the age group 
considered and the scope of developmental disabilities 
addressed. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors Study (GBD) offers an independent source of 
robust age-specific data on non-fatal health outcomes.13,14 
We aimed to estimate the prevalence of disability and 
years lived with disability (YLDs) among children younger 
than 5 years with developmental disabilities based on 
findings from GBD 2016. This analysis provides baseline 
data for monitoring the trends in these metrics over time 
among children younger than 5 years during the SDG era. 
Leading causes of specific developmental disabilities are 
also examined.
Methods
Overview
This study complies with Guidelines for Accurate and 
Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) 
recommendations.15 An overview of the general 
modelling strategies for the non-fatal health outcomes of 
328 diseases and conditions, as defined in International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes 9 and 10, is 
provided in the appendix. Detailed descriptions of the 
modelling approaches for each of the four impairments 
(epilepsy, intellectual disability, hearing loss, and vision 
loss) and two GBD causes (ASD and ADHD) included in 
this report, along with specific data, diagnostic, and 
modelling considerations for each, are also provided in 
the appendix.
The causes included in estimation of each of the 
impairments are shown in the appendix. Although 
cerebral palsy was not estimated as a separate impairment, 
estimates of its prevalence and YLDs are included in 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Since 2007, The Lancet Series on early childhood development 
has provided estimates of children at risk of suboptimal 
development in low-income and middle-income countries 
(LMICs). However, similar to previous estimates, the most 
recent estimate of 250 million at-risk children, which was 
derived from 141 countries, is restricted to those who are 
stunted or exposed to extreme poverty in LMICs and excludes 
the vast majority of children with developmental delays and 
disabilities. More comprehensive baseline data that directly 
describe dimensions of health related to neurocognitive 
development are required for monitoring the proportion of 
children younger than 5 years who are at risk of suboptimal 
development in health, learning, and wellbeing globally as 
mandated by the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
Study 2016 (GBD 2016) produced comprehensive and 
comparable estimates of age-specific health disorders for 
195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016.
Added value of this study
This study reports GBD 2016 estimates of the prevalence and 
years lived with disability for developmental disabilities 
among children younger than 5 years, including epilepsy, 
intellectual disability, vision loss, hearing loss, autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD). To our knowledge, this study is the first to 
investigate trends in the burden of these developmental 
disabilities between 1990 and 2016 and to provide baseline 
data for monitoring progress at the global, regional, 
and country levels under the SDGs. 
Implications of all the available evidence
Although under-5 mortality halved between 1990 and 2016, 
there has not been a corresponding improvement in non-fatal 
health outcomes among childhood survivors globally. 
The number of children younger than 5 years at risk of 
suboptimal development in LMICs is likely to exceed 
350 million (roughly three in every five children), even without 
inclusion of all known disabilities in GBD 2016. The absence of 
any systematic attention to developmental disabilities has had 
greatest effect in sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of 
affected children increased by more than 70% between 1990 
and 2016, despite an overall decrease in prevalence worldwide 
during this period. The SDGs now present a comprehensive 
framework for addressing the burden of developmental delays 
and disabilities among survivors of the leading causes of child 
mortality in the early years of life, especially in LMICs. More 
crucially, local health and educational systems should be 
appropriately equipped to support affected children and their 
families optimally. Although the prevalence of conditions such 
as ASD and ADHD typically peak at school age or later, some 
children will require timely intervention from early childhood. 
Global investment is needed to improve primary data sources 
for developmental disabilities to minimise uncertainty around 
the estimates of non-fatal health outcomes in most countries.

those of intellectual disability because of overlapping, 
cause-specific perinatal complications, including neonatal 
preterm birth complications, neonatal encephalopathy 
due to asphyxia and birth trauma, neonatal sepsis and 
other neonatal infections, and kernicterus after neonatal 
jaundice. We considered all developmental disorders or 
impairments as proxies for developmental disabilities in 
this study.
The two metrics, prevalence and YLDs, associated with 
developmental disorders in the GBD study are collectively 
referred to as the burden of disability in this study, 
without prejudice towards any ethical, sociocultural, or 
public health constructs of disability in the literature. 
Prevalence estimates are stated in both absolute numbers 
and per 100 000 children, in keeping with the practice for 
all conditions in the GBD study. The term disability is 
used to describe the perceived short-term or long-term 
loss of health (and not welfare loss) associated with a 
condition, which is reflected through an estimated 
disability weight.16 Thus, YLDs do not strictly measure 
disability from a public health perspective based on 
WHO’s International Classification of Functioning, 
Disability and Health (ICF).17 Rather, the metric seeks to 
provide a comparable measure of disease burden across 
diverse health conditions and impairments.13
Case definitions and diagnostic criteria were based on 
ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes complemented with relevant 
guidelines, such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV-TR and the Guidelines for 
Epidemiologic Studies on Epilepsy.18,19 Developmental 
intellectual disability was separated into five bands based 
on intelligence quotient scores: borderline, mild, 
moderate, severe, and profound. Hearing and visual 
impairments were similarly separated into bands of 
severity corresponding to frequency response and visual 
acuity cutoffs, respectively. The age at which conditions 
such as ASD and ADHD could be diagnosed in early 
childhood was also considered in input data evaluation 
and model development.
Data sources and modelling strategy
The GBD estimation strategy is designed to provide a 
standardised analytical approach for estimating prev-
alence and YLDs by age, sex, cause, year, and location. 
The first step in the estimation of each condition was 
compilation of all available data inputs from systematic 
reviews of the literature, hospital and claims databases, 
health surveys, case notification systems, cohort studies, 
and multinational survey data. All input data for 
GBD 2016 are available at the Global Health Data 
Exchange. Effort was made to optimise the comparability 
of data derived from different sources using different 
methods, to find a consistent set of estimates across 
prevalence data, and to generate estimates for locations 
with sparse or no data by use of available information 
from other locations combined with covariates.13 We 
obtained prevalence estimates by age group from 1990 to 
2016 using DisMod-MR 2.1, a statistical modelling, 
Bayesian meta-regression tool developed for the GBD 
project.20 DisMod-MR 2.1 synthesises epidemiological 
data for non-fatal health outcomes from disparate settings 
and sources, adjusting for different case definitions or 
diagnostic criteria and sampling methods to generate 
internally consistent estimates of prevalence, incidence, 
remission, and mortality by location, year, age group, and 
sex. Estimation in DisMod-MR 2.1 occurs sequentially at 
five levels: global, super-region, region, country, and 
subnational. Results from higher levels guide analyses at 
lower geographical levels. Model parameters, input data 
values, and fit statistics for each component model are 
viewable in the publicly available Epi Visualisation tool.
After generating internally consistent estimates of 
incidence, prevalence, remission, and mortality for each 
condition, prevalent cases were distributed among a set of 
mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive sequelae (ie, 
severity of the disease state). The complete sequela list 
for each cause and impairment are provided in their 
corresponding methods description in the appendix. 
After initial calculation of sequela-level prevalence, 
GBD ensured that the sum of all causes leading to 
each impairment was scaled to equal the total number 
of cases of the impairment. Because of the commonality 
of co-occurrence of epilepsy, blindness, and intellectual 
disability arising from many causes (eg, neonatal compli-
cations leading to cerebral palsy, long-term complications 
of cerebral malaria and meningitis), scaling the prevalence 
sums of each impairment was done sequentially. After 
scaling, each sequela was paired with a unique health 
state describing the associated disability. Each health state 
had a corresponding disability weight that was estimated 
with pairwise comparison methods that presented 
pairs of lay health-state descriptions to more than 
60 000 respondents in open web-based surveys done 
among the general population in nine countries 
(Bangladesh, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, Peru, Sweden, 
Tanzania, the USA, and the Netherlands). Disability 
weights ranged between 0 (perfect health) and 1 (death),16 
and were assumed to be similar in different locations. By 
contrast, the distribution of sequelae varied by location, 
year, sex, and age. Sequela-level prevalence estimates were 
multiplied by the disability weights to generate YLDs. 
YLDs for each sequela were then adjusted for comorbidity 
with a microsimulation framework that assumed that 
comorbidity within each age group, sex, location, and year 
was independent.
All computations in GBD were done 1000 times, each 
time drawing from the distribution of the sampling 
error of data inputs, the uncertainty of data corrections 
for measurement errors, the uncertainty in coefficients 
from model fit, and the uncertainty of severity 
distributions 
and 
disability 
weights. 
Uncertainty 
intervals (UIs) were defined by the 25th and 975th values 
of the ordered 1000 estimate values. Changes in 
estimates between locations or over time that were in the

same direction in more than 950 of the 1000 samples 
were considered as significant. Final estimates for 
children younger than 5 years were compiled by 
summing the prevalence and YLD estimates in the first 
four GBD age groups: early neonatal (0–6 days), late 
neonatal (7–27 days), post-neonatal (28–364 days), and 
1–4 years. The aggregate figures for each of the 
impairments are independent from one another so the 
total burden from all developmental impairments is 
somewhat less than the sum of each impairment 
because of comorbidities.

Results
Global trend in prevalence and YLDs of developmental 
disabilities
The estimated global number of children younger than 
5 years in GBD 2016 was 598·5 million in 1990, 
600·2 million in 2005, 626·9 million in 2010, and 
632·0 million in 2016. The total number of children with 
any of the six developmental disabilities after adjusting 
for comorbidity between intellectual disability and ASD 
was 53·0 million (95% UI 49·0–57·1 [8·9%, 8·2–9·5]) in 
1990 compared with 52·9 million (48·7–57·3 [8·4%, 
7·7–9·1]) in 2016. Of the children with developmental 
disabilities in 2016, 2·7 million (5·1%) lived in high-
income countries and 50·2 million (94·9%) in LMICs 
(table 1). About 54% of children with any developmental 
disability were male, although the proportions of male 
and female children varied by type of impairment.
Vision loss was the most prevalent developmental 
disability and decreased from 1990 to 2016 (figure 1). 
26·4 million (95% UI 24·0–29·2) children had vision 
loss in 1990, corresponding to a prevalence of 
4407 (95% UI 4006–4887) per 100 000 children. This 
figure declined to 25·2 million (22·7–28·4) in 2016, 
corresponding to a prevalence of 3991 (3595–4487) per 
100 000 children. Hearing loss was the second most 
prevalent disability, affecting 15·0 million (13·0–17·1) 
children (prevalence 2511 [95% UI 2178–2859] per 
100 000) in 1990. Although the prevalence of hearing 
loss decreased to 2445 (95% UI 2113–2793) per 
100 000 children in 2016, the number of affected 
children increased slightly to 15·5 million (95% UI 
13·4–17·7). ADHD was the least prevalent disability 
during the period, but increased from 835 171 
(746 061–946 713) affected children in 1990 to 890 229 
(794 104–1 022 157) in 2016. Intellectual disability was 
associated with the highest YLDs through 
out the 
period, followed by epilepsy, hearing loss, vision loss, 
ASD, and ADHD (figure 1). Compared with the 
estimates in 1990, the YLDs for intellectual disability 
and epilepsy increased in 2016, whereas the YLDs for 
hearing loss showed a steady but modest decline up to 
2016. Generally, the UIs for the YLDs were wider than 
those for prevalence (figure 1).
Although the prevalence of developmental disabilities 
in children younger than 5 years declined from 1990 to 
2006 in all regions except North America, the number of 
affected children increased by 71·3% in sub-Saharan 
Africa, 7·6% in north Africa and the Middle East, and 
5·9% in North America (figure 2, table 1). These 
increases were offset globally by a decline in the number 
of children with disabilities in all other regions during 
this period, with southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania 
recording the largest decline of 34·5%. The six dis-
abilities accounted for 3·8 million (95% UI 2·8–4·9) 
YLDs in 1990 compared with 3·9 million (2·9–5·2) 
in 2016 (table 1), representing 13·3% of the total 
29·3 million (20·7–39·8) YLDs from all causes in 
children younger than 5 years in 2016. Sub-Saharan Africa 
recorded the highest increase in YLDs (91·1%), whereas 
southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania recorded the 
greatest decrease (–32·8%; figure 2).
Regional and national prevalence of developmental 
disabilities in 2016
The geographical distribution of developmental dis-
abilities in 2016 based on prevalence estimates is shown 
in figure 3. Unlike most developmental disabilities, ASD 
was least prevalent in western Europe and ADHD in 
south Asia. The highest number of children with 
intellectual disability (3·9 million [95% UI 3·1–4·7]), 
hearing loss (5·1 million [4·4–5·8]), and ASD (1·2 million 
[1·0–1·4]) were recorded in south Asia (table 2), accounting 
for 31·1%, 32·9%, and 25·4% of the global prevalence, 
respectively. The highest number of children with epilepsy 
(1·2 million [0·8–1·7]), vision loss (6·9 million [6·2–7·8]), 
and ADHD (284 197 [251 986–325 635]) were recorded 
in sub-Saharan Africa, representing 30·4%, 27·5%, 
and 31·9% of the global prevalence, respectively. The

prevalence per 100 000 children of intellectual disability 
(2567 [95% UI 2099–3189]), vision loss (4947 [4324–5803]), 
and ASD (785 [645–948]) were highest in north Africa and 
the Middle East. Epilepsy, hearing loss, and vision loss 
were least prevalent in North America, whereas intellectual 
disability was least prevalent in Latin America. The 
highest prevalence of children with all disabilities was 
recorded in south Asia (9792 [8940–10 641] per 100 000) 
and the lowest in North America (4090 [3735–4467] per 
100 000; table 1).
Country-specific prevalence estimates for each disability 
are presented in the appendix. For all disabilities, India 
had the highest number of affected children, except for 
ADHD, for which the highest number of affected children 
was in China (table 3). On the African continent, Nigeria, 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Ethiopia were 
among the top ten countries with the highest number of 
children with any disability. The USA was one of the top 
ten countries for intellectual disability, hearing loss, ASD, 
and ADHD. The highest prevalence of each disability was 
found in LMICs, apart from ASD and ADHD, which 
were highest in Sweden and Australia. The top 
ten countries accounted for more than half of the global 
prevalence of all developmental disabilities except for 
ADHD (48·2%; table 3).
Regional and national YLDs of developmental 
disabilities in 2016
The highest YLDs for all disabilities except for ASD were 
reported in sub-Saharan Africa (the highest YLDs for 
ASD were recorded in south Asia; table 2). The lowest 
YLDs for all developmental disabilities except ASD and 
ADHD were reported in North America. The lowest YLDs 
for ASD were reported in western Europe, and for ADHD 
in central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia. 
However, the highest YLDs per 100 000 population for 
intellectual disability and vision loss were reported in 
north Africa and the Middle East, while the highest YLDs 
per 100 000 population for hearing loss were recorded in 
south Asia. The top ten countries accounted for more 
than half of the YLDs for all disabilities except ADHD 
which amounted to 48·2%. On a regional basis, the 
highest YLDs per 100 000 population for the six disabilities 
combined was recorded in north Africa and the 
Middle East (758 [95% UI 540–1090]) and the lowest in 
North America (346 [254–451]; table 1).
Country-specific YLDs for each disability are presented 
in the appendix. The highest YLDs for all disabilities 
except ADHD were found in India, while the highest 
YLDs for ADHD were recorded in China. The highest 
YLDs for epilepsy, intellectual disability, and vision loss 
were in Dominican Republic, for hearing loss in Yemen, 
and for ADHD and ASD in Australia (table 3).
Leading causes of developmental disabilities in 2016
The underlying causes of the four disorders con 
ceptually 
modelled as impairments in GBD 2016 are presented 
in the appendix. Refraction and accommodation dis-
orders (85·2%) were the leading cause of vision loss 
globally. The major causes of hearing loss were otitis 
media (57·1%) and congenital anomalies (21·1%). 
Congenital anomalies (39·7%) and neonatal disorders, 
including preterm birth complications, infections, and 
birth asphyxia (21·0%), were the prominent known 
causes of intellectual disability, whereas idiopathic causes 
accounted for 29·0%. Neonatal disorders (51·8%) were 
the leading cause of epilepsy. The extent to which these 
causes contributed to each impairment varied across the 
regions and by country.
Discussion
About 52·9 million (8·4%) children worldwide had one 
of the six developmental disabilities investigated by the 
GBD group in 2016 compared with 53·0 million (8·9%) 
in 1990. This marginal change is in sharp contrast with 
the trend in under-5 mortality, which substantially 
declined from 11 million (95% UI 10·8–11·3) in 1990 to 
5 million (4·8–5·2) in 2016.14 The disproportionately 
high burden of development disabilities in LMICs has 
been corroborated by a 2018 systematic review.21 The 
increasing burden reflects the absence of any systematic 
global initiative to curtail this burden among the 
increasing number of children who are surviving the

first 5 years of life. It is likely that improving neonatal 
survival rates, particularly for those born prematurely, is 
contributing substantially to this burden, especially 
during the MDG era.
As with most health conditions, the dearth of 
population-based data for developmental disabilities, 
especially in LMICs,21 has led to a reliance on statistical 
estimation of trends in health outcomes to guide health

policy and interventions. This practice is underpinned 
by the view that the absence of evidence is not evidence 
of absence. In this study, we aimed to distil the best 
available epidemiological data on the global burden of 
developmental disabilities among children younger than 
5 years from the extensive GBD 2016 database to facilitate 
an objective assessment of progress in promoting early 
childhood development under the SDG framework.
Although a direct comparison with our study is im-
practicable because of differences in methods, Lu and 
colleagues11 estimated a declining trend between 2007 
and 2010 in the number of developmentally at-risk 
children exposed to stunting or extreme poverty in 
LMICs. When combining data from our study with data 
from other studies11,12 of early childhood development 
based on stunting, extreme poverty, and low cognition, 
we obtained a crude estimate of 350 million for the 
number of children at risk of not realising their develop-
mental potential in LMICs, or three in every five children 
younger than 5 years (appendix). This estimate is likely 
to be an underestimate since we have excluded prominent 
disabilities such as idiopathic cerebral palsy and other 
motor disorders from the study. However, given that this 
estimate includes neither separate estimates of cerebral 
palsy nor quantification of the role of home life and 
access to education, there is at best sparse information 
about the effects of modest growth and nutritional 
deficits on the long-term neurocognitive development of 
young children. Our study also suggests that the burden 
is higher in males than in females for most developmental 
disabilities.
Globally, 
YLDs 
associated 
with 
developmental 
disabilities have not improved since 1990. The only 
exception perhaps was the modest decline in vision loss, 
which might be attributable to effects of the Vision 2020 
global initiative, which was launched in 1999 by WHO.22 
Although hearing and vision loss were the most prevalent 
among the six disabilities from 1990 to 2016, intellectual 
disability and epilepsy were associated with the highest 
YLDs in children younger than 5 years. It is possible that 
rehabilitation with glasses and hearing aids alleviated 
the effects of impairment in some children with sensory 
losses, whereas children with intellectual disability and 
epilepsy experience greater societal stigma and support 
services are often inadequate in LMIC settings. However, 
over the entire life course, hearing loss was found to be 
the third leading cause of YLDs globally in 2016, and the 
second leading cause if combined with vision loss.13 
Recognising the need for comprehensive early detection 
and intervention for all children with or at risk of any 
developmental disability from birth is perhaps more 
crucial than in later years, given the substantial YLDs 
associated with these conditions over a life course.
Summary global estimates often mask significant 
variations at the regional and national levels. Although 
minimal decline was observed between 1990 and 2016 
globally, the burden of all developmental disabilities

substantially increased in sub-Saharan Africa and in 
north Africa and the Middle East. Moreover, south Asia 
and sub-Saharan Africa, which frequently account for the 
highest child mortality globally, had the highest number 
of children with developmental disabilities, although 
south Asia showed some modest progress. This finding 
is consistent with other reports on the risk of suboptimal 
development among children younger than 5 years.10–12 
For example, regardless of the differences in case 
definition, India, China, and Nigeria were the three 
leading countries with the highest number of children 
with or at risk of developmental disabilities. In 2016, 
Democratic Republic of the Congo displaced Nigeria 
from the third position for vision loss. Except for the 
USA, China, and Brazil, the ten leading countries 
for developmental disabilities were predominantly 
from south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. This pattern of 
disease burden exemplifies the ethical rationale of the 
disability-inclusive framework of the SDGs that seeks to 
promote and ensure safety nets for the survivors of acute 
childhood illnesses in LMICs to set them on the trajectory 
of optimal early childhood development.
Given the variability in population sizes, the countries 
with the highest prevalence were usually not among the

leading countries by actual number of children. 
Population-based data in some high-income countries, 
such as the USA, in fact show significant increasing 
trends in the prevalence of most developmental 
disabilities due in part to increases in the diagnosis and 
recognition of developmental disorders such as ASD 
and ADHD.23–25 This trend is consistent with the observed 
increases in the overall burden of developmental 
disabilities between 1990 and 2016 in North America. 
Moreover, the prevalence of all disabilities in the USA in 
GBD 2016 (4·1%, 95% UI 3·8–4·5) is comparable to the 
5·2% reported among children younger than 6 years in 
the study by Houtrow and colleagues.23 The low 
prevalence of ADHD that we found globally compared 
with other disabilities could be partly attributable to the 
fact that no incidence was assumed before age 2 years in 
our modelling strategy (appendix). Also, except for 
severely affected children, the onset of ASD symptoms 
typically occurs by age 3 years, but may not fully manifest 
until school age or later.25 Additional information about 
the GBD method for identification and classification of 
ASD, which is applicable to ADHD, can be found in an 
earlier report by Baxter and colleagues.26 Although the 
GBD estimates are quite conservative, our findings 
underscore the need for intervention in some infants 
with ASD and ADHD from early childhood.
Identification of the major causes, as well as the 
effects, of developmental disabilities should be an 
urgent priority in regions with the largest prevalence 
and absolute burden for several reasons.9,17,27,28 First, 
most of the countries in those regions lack functional 
health-care and social-care systems to support children 
with disabilities. Second, the lifetime costs of 
supporting children with disabilities are substantial 
and might further impoverish many poor families and 
communities. Third, societal stigma and unfavourable 
cultural beliefs place children at great risk of neglect, 
violence, or even infanticide. Fourth, educational and 
vocational opportunities are limited and rarely allow 
full economic participation and independence of 
children with developmental disabilities when they 
transition into adulthood. A range of interventions for 
children with or at risk of developmental disabilities are 
well described in the literature,8,9,17,29 and include 
primary prevention aimed at reducing the incidence of 
developmental 
disabilities, 
secondary 
prevention 
through early detection of dis 
abilities at a time when 
the brain is still very sensitive to interventions and 
change, and tertiary prevention through comprehensive 
community-based rehabilitation pro 
grammes (now 
termed community-based inclusive development), as 
exemplified by some early childhood development 
initiatives in high-burden LMICs such as Bangladesh 
and India.30,31 Some disabilities might be less amenable 
than others to prevention. For example, the GBD study 
did not investigate the causes of ASD and ADHD, 
which are often attributed to complex interactions 
between genetic and environmental factors.32 However, 
several risk factors amenable to intervention have been 
reported in the literature and merit attention and 
efforts to equip local health and educational systems 
to provide requisite services for the affected children 
and their families.33 The newly launched Nurturing 
Care Frame 
work for Early Childhood Development 
by WHO and its partners to facilitate optimal early 
childhood development in LMICs34 should necessarily 
also prioritise actions to address the specific needs 
of children with or at risk of developmental disabilities 
under the SDG era, especially in nations with a high 
burden.35 A cursory or symbolic reference to develop-
mental disabilities in this framework will not be 
adequate or effective in galvanising the required 
attention by policy makers for the affected children and 
their families.
The disability-inclusive aspirations of the SDGs 
agenda are reinforced by the UN’s Conventions on the 
Rights of the Child and the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities. Since 2016, the GBD study has introduced 
a component for monitoring health-related targets 
and indicators periodically under the SDGs. Presently, 
50 health-related indicators that directly involve health 
services, health outcomes, and risk factors with well 
established causal links have been identified, of 
which 37 are monitored in GBD 2016.36 Children with 
developmental disabilities are not yet captured within 
this framework because SDG 4 (to ensure inclusive 
and equitable quality education and promote lifelong 
learning opportunities for all) is completely omitted 
from the considered health-related indicators. More-
over, developmental disabilities have not yet been 
explicitly linked with SDG 3, which seeks to ensure 
healthy lives and promote wellbeing at all ages. It is 
hoped that the growing evidence on health-related 
causes of developmental disabilities reported in this 
study, and elsewhere, will facilitate the development of 
specific and explicit health-related indicators to address 
the special needs of the affected children.37,38
Similar to any modelling endeavour in epidemiology, 
GBD 2016 has limitations that have been extensively 
described elsewhere in line with the GATHER reporting 
guidelines.13,14 For example, most of the uncertainty in the 
YLD estimates are likely to result from limitations in the 
calculations of disability weights. These uncertainties 
might be minimised in the future by removing some of 
the ambiguities in lay descriptions, providing better 
definitions for disorders in surveys, and increasing the 
general volume and quality of survey data in this area. 
Additionally, the non-fatal models, especially for conditions 
such as ASD and ADHD, continue to rely on sparse data in 
many regions and exemplify the unique challenges 
associated with measuring disability in childhood, 
particularly for more subtle and difficult to diagnose 
conditions such as ASD and ADHD.38,39 Ultimately, a 
measure of functional limitations consistent with ICF is

needed to complement the YLDs for developmental 
disabilities in childhood.
Additional limitations of this study deserve mention. 
First, direct and separate prevalence and YLDs estimates 
for other disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, com-
munication, and motor disorders, were not provided, 
which will have resulted in underestimation of the overall 
number of children with developmental dis 
abilities. There 
is no evidence to suggest, for example, that there has been 
any improvement in the global burden of cerebral palsy 
between 1990 and 2016.40,41 Second, age-standardised 
prevalence estimates and severity patterns of impairments 
were not reported in this analysis but are freely available at 
the Global Health Data Exchange for download and 
interactive visualisation for all the 195 countries and 
territories in GBD 2016. Third, we did not estimate the 
incidence of developmental delays and disabilities. Finally, 
it was difficult to completely and precisely account for 
children with multiple disabilities and across multiple 
developmental domains. These overlaps were partially 
captured by estimation of prevalence of sequelae 
(most children with ASD also have intellectual disability), 
ensuring the total number of cases of each impairment 
equals the sum across all GBD causes, and accounting for 
the overlap between epilepsy, blindness, and intellectual 
disability. Therefore, the sum of the impairments and 
causes is not equal to the total number of children with 
developmental disability. Some residual overlap is 
certainly likely, however, especially for hearing and vision 
loss. We believe that the findings in the GBD study provide 
valuable baseline data for action and further refinements 
as more and better primary input sources become 
available for all developmental disabilities. This viewpoint 
is without prejudice to other ICF-oriented approaches to 
quantifying the actual burden of develop 
mental disabilities 
at the family and societal levels. The annual updating of 
GBD allows for expedient incorporation of such insights 
and data as they become available. Additionally, because 
future GBD iterations will continue to refine the methods, 
incorporate new data sources, and reanalyse the entire 
time series, our estimates for 1990–2016 might not be 
identical to those in subsequent GBD reports.
In conclusion, although the burden of mortality 
among children younger than 5 years has been halved 
between 1990 and 2016, there has been no corre 
s-
ponding improvement in non-fatal health outcomes 
among children with developmental disabilities globally. 
This lack of improvement might be attributed to 
absent or inadequate systematic policies and inter-
ventions to address the needs of survivors of childhood 
illnesses who develop life-long disabilities from early 
childhood, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. This report 
underscores the importance of developing explicit health-
related indicators for monitoring progress to address 
the needs and rights of children with or at risk of 
developmental disabilities within the framework of the 
disability-inclusive mandates of the SDGs and beyond. 
More crucially, local health and educational systems 
should be appropriately equipped to support affected 
children and their families optimally.
