Atypical sensory sensitivity 
as a shared feature between 
synaesthesia and autism

Several studies have suggested that there is a link between synaesthesia and autism but the nature of 
that link remains poorly characterised. The present study considers whether atypical sensory sensitivity 
may be a common link between the conditions. Sensory hypersensitivity (aversion to certain sounds, 
touch, etc., or increased ability to make sensory discriminations) and/or hyposensitivity (desire to 
stimulate the senses , or a reduced response to sensory stimuli are a recently introduced diagnostic 
feature of autism spectrum conditions (ASC). Synaesthesia is defined by unusual sensory experiences 
and has also been linked to a typical cortical hyper-excitability. The Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire 
(GSQ) was administered to synaesthetes and people with ASC. Both groups reported increased sensory 
sensitivity relative to controls with a large effect size. Both groups also reported a similar pattern 
of both increased hyper- and hypo-sensitivities across multiple senses. The AQ (Autism-Spectrum 
Quotient) scores were elevated in the synaesthetes, and one subscale of this measure (attention to 
detail) placed synaesthetes within the autistic range. A standard laboratory test of visual stress (the 
Pattern Glare Test), administered online, corroborated the findings of increased sensitivity to aversive 
visual stimuli in synaesthetes. We conclude that atypical sensory sensitivity is an important shared 
feature between autism and synaesthesia.
People with synaesthesia have unusual experiences of the world: for example, words may evoke tastes, sequences 
such as months and numbers may be visualised as spatial landscapes (sequence-space synaesthesia), and graph-
emes (i.e., letters/numbers) may evoke colours (grapheme-colour synaesthesia). The present study focuses on 
grapheme-colour synaesthesia. Synaesthetic experiences tend to be percept-like in nature, occur automatically, 
and are triggered by inducing stimuli1,2. Synaesthesia emerges during childhood, if not before3, has a hereditary 
component4, and is linked to structural and functional differences in the brain5. It is also linked to wider cognitive 
differences - for example, in memory6 and mental imagery7 - but is not linked to global difficulties in intellectual 
functioning8. However, recent research has suggested that synaesthesia and Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) 
co-occur together more than would be expected by chance. Neufeld et al.9 and Baron-Cohen et al.10 screened 
samples of patients diagnosed with autism for grapheme-colour synaesthesia (primarily) and reported preva-
lence rates of 17.2% and 18.9% respectively. The current prevalence estimate for grapheme-colour synaesthesia is 
1–2%11. Hence these studies suggest a link between synaesthesia and autism. But what is the nature of that link? 
The present research considers this from the perspective of sensory sensitivity.
Autism is a heterogeneous condition that impacts on several cognitive domains. It is unclear whether all, or 
only some, of these domains are related to synaesthesia. Autism entails impairments in social communication 
alongside unusually narrow interests and repetitive behavior (DSM-5, 2013). Contemporary models of autism 
also attempt to account for relative strengths as well as impairments. The empathizing-systemizing model of 
autism emphasizes not only the socio-cognitive difficulties in understanding others (linked to empathizing) but 
also an interest in and aptitude for rule-based systems (hyper-systemizing)12. Related, others have characterized 
the cognitive style of autism in terms of more local information processing that may, for instance, give them an 
advantage on certain perceptual tasks such as finding hidden (embedded) figures13.
What traits relating to autism are found in studies of synaesthesia? Banissy et al.14 administered personal-
ity questionnaires to a large group of grapheme-colour synaesthetes. Two of these assessed empathy and social

functioning (the Inter-Personal Reactivity Index, IRI, and Empathy Quotient, EQ) that are known to differenti-
ate people with autism and controls15,16. However, the synaesthetes did not score differently on any subscale in 
these measures. In terms of autism-related abilities and differences in cognitive style, there is more positive evi-
dence. Mealor et al.17 developed the Sussex Cognitive Styles Questionnaire that links together mental imagery18, 
local/global bias and systemizing. This questionnaire was given to people with grapheme-colour synaesthesia, 
sequence-space synaesthesia, synaesthetes with both, and controls with neither (but not to an autistic group). 
The presence of sequence-space synaesthesia was linked to increased systemizing, increased technical/spatial 
processing which also contains items from the Systemising Quotient19, and increased local bias which contained 
items from the Autism-Spectrum Quotient, AQ20 (grapheme-colour synaesthetes tended to have scores inter-
mediate between controls and sequence-space synaesthetes). Sequence-space synaesthesia has been linked to 
certain forms of savant abilities, prevalent in the autistic population, such as prodigious memorisation of dates21. 
Of course, other forms of synaesthesia may be relevant to savantism too (e.g. music visualisation).
The present study considers, whether sensory sensitivity is a common facet of both synaesthesia and 
autism. The 2013 Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM-5) added the following to their list of criteria: “Hyper- or 
hypo-reactivity to sensory input or unusual interests in sensory aspects of the environment (e.g., apparent indif-
ference to pain/temperature, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of 
objects, visual fascination with lights or movement).” In order to explore this feature of autism experimentally, 
several measures have been developed22–24. The Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire (GSQ) – used in the present 
study – contains items relating to seven sensory modalities (vision, hearing, taste, touch, smell, vestibular, propri-
oception) that tap both hypesensitivity and hyposensitivity22. People with high autistic traits score significantly 
higher than controls and, interestingly, all questions loaded on a single factor (i.e. there was no evidence of frac-
tionation according to sensory modalities or whether hypo- or hyper-). Questionnaire measures of sensory sen-
sitivity show no evidence of a neurotypical gender difference22,24 unlike other traits related to autism that do show 
gender differences (with males on average tending to score lower on empathizing and higher at systemizing12).
Grapheme-colour synaesthetes show evidence of a hyper-excitable visual cortex as shown by reduced 
phosphene thresholds when the brain is stimulated using TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation)25. They show 
increased amplitude visual-evoked potentials, in EEG, for certain simple visual stimuli that do not elicit synaes-
thesia26 and have enhanced perceptual discrimination for colour27. As such, we hypothesise that grapheme-colour 
synaesthetes will report unusual sensitivity in the visual domain but it is less clear whether this pattern will extend 
to other modalities too (as found in autism).
In the study below, we administer the GSQ to a group of participants with a confirmed diagnosis of autism, 
a group of verified grapheme-colour synaesthetes (with most reporting sequence-space synaesthesia too), and a 
group of controls. The AQ (Autism-Spectrum Quotient) was given to the synaesthetes and controls to assess for the 
broader range of traits linked autism. Finally, a common measure of ‘visual stress’ termed the Pattern Glare Test28 
is given to synaesthetes and controls. It was not given to the autism sample as they took part in other research (not 
reported here). The test was given to corroborate the GSQ measure to see whether questionnaire differences (group 
differences and/or individual differences) can be related to differences on a more psychophysical measure.
In the Pattern Glare Test, participants are shown black-and-white gratings of different spatial frequencies. 
People with high visual stress report being highly sensitive to mid-frequency gratings (2–5 cycles per degree at 
which contrast sensitivity is optimal)29. These stimuli are reported as not only being aversive but also as inducing 
visual experiences such as shimmer, shapes, and colour. The fact that an achromatic stimulus (with similar physi-
cal properties to printed text30) can induce colour in some people has interesting parallels with grapheme-colour 
synaesthesia. Those who are susceptible to this test are assumed to have a highly-excitable visual cortex31. 
Importantly, this test also contains a control stimulus (of low spatial frequency) that is not linked to visual stress 
and acts as a baseline to correct for any overall tendency for people to report unusual visual experiences per se. 
We also include a high spatial frequency grating that also tends to be linked to visual stress (see Table 1) although 
this may reflect opthalmological effects as well as cortical ones32.
In summary, we have three main hypotheses. First, both synaesthetes and the ASC group will have higher sen-
sory sensitivity on the GSQ (although we are agnostic as to whether all aspects will be affected). Secondly, on the 
basis of previous research showing a higher prevalence of synaesthesia in autism we hypothesise that synaesthetes 
will have an elevated AQ score (again, we are agnostic as to which aspects of the AQ might be affected). Finally, 
we hypothesise that that high sensory sensitivity, on the GSQ, will be related to a psychophysical measure of visual 
stress (the Pattern Glare Test).

other even after a Bonferroni correction (ASC v. controls: applying Levene’s correction t(141.5) = 
 8.265, p < 
 0.001, 
d = 
 1.32; synaesthetes v. controls: t(52.3) =

 0.81; ASC v. synaesthetes: t(111) = 
 2.150, 
p = 
 0.034, d =

(F(1,193) = 3.056, p = 0.082; η 
p
2 = 0.016) were significant covariates.
More detailed explorations show that synaesthetes show a similar pattern of responding to the ASC sample 
insofar as they show both increased hypersensitivities and increased hyposensitivities across multiple modal-
ities. The results are shown in Fig. 2. The basic pattern of ASC > 
 Synaesthetes > 
 Controls holds in virtually 
every case. That is, synaesthetes present with a pattern of atypical sensory sensitivity that qualitatively resem-
bles that found in autism but is not as extreme as that found in autism. A 3 × 
 7 ANOVA was conducted con-
trasting group (synaesthetes, ASC, controls) and modality on the hypersensitivity scores and hyposensitivity 
scores separately. Considering hypersensitivity, there was a main effect of group (F(2,196) = 
 36.480, p < 
 0.001, 
η 
p
2 = 
 0.271). There was also a main effect of modality (F(6,1176) = 
 118.151, p < 
 0.001, η 
p
2 = 
 0.376) and an inter-
action between group and modality (F(12,1176) = 
 2.114, p = 
 0.014, η 
p
2 = 
 0.021) such that the differences between 
groups were more pronounced for some modalities than others. However, we did not pursue multiple pairwise 
comparisons as these were not theoretically motivated at this finer-grained level and these modality differences 
are already noted in prior research on autism33. The pattern was similar for the hyposensitivity questions. There 
was a main effect of group (F(2,196) = 
 25.151, p < 
 0.001, η 
p
2 = 
 0.204). There was also a main effect of modality 
(F(6,1176) = 90.655, p < 0.001, η 
p
2 = 
 0.316) and an interaction between group and modality (F(12,1176) = 6.471, 
p < 0.001, η 
p
2 = 
 0.062) such that the differences between groups were more pronounced for some modalities (e.g. 
auditory) than others (e.g. olfactory). Robertson33 noted that scores for olfactory were the lowest of all modalities, 
and it is to be noted that the hypo-olfactory questions had some of the lowest factor loadings in their Principal 
Component Analysis (i.e. are less representative of the scale as a whole). All three groups in our study show 
a tendency for ‘hypo’ and ‘hyper’ items to correlate (synaesthetes: r = 
 0.77; ASC r = 
 0.74; controls r = 
 0.64; all 
p < 0.001) consistent with previous findings33.
The mean AQ scores of synaesthetes was 23.0 (SD = 
 9.3) and the mean of controls was 18.6 (SD = 
 8.8), with 
this difference being statistically significant (F(1,113) = 
 4.332, p = 
 0.040, η 
p
2 = 
 0.037) but neither gender 
(F(1,113) = 
 1.069, p = 
 0.303; η 
p
2 = 
 0.009) nor age (F(1,113) = 
 0.736, p = 
 0.393; η 
p
2 = 
 0.006) were significant covar-
iates. Fig. 3 shows these scores, broken down according to the five AQ subscales (social skills, attention switching, 
attention to detail, communication, and imagination) and contrasted against our ASC sample (for whom this data 
was already available). A 5 × 
 3 ANCOVA contrasting subscale score and group, with age and gender as covariates, 
revealed main effects of group (F(2,178) = 
 147.764, p < 
 0.001, η 
p
2 = 
 0.624) and subscale (F(4,712) = 
 6.469, 
p < 
 0.001, η 
p
2 = 
 0.035) and an interaction between them (F(4,712) = 
 16.395, p < 
 0.001, η 
p
2 = 
 0.156) with neither 
age nor gender acting as significant covariates. The interaction is due to different patterns across the subscales 
(confirmed by post-hoc t-tests shown in Fig. 3): the synaesthetes statistically resembled the ASC sample on atten-
tion to detail (i.e. ASC = 
 Syn > 
 controls), but statistically resembled controls on the other subscales (i.e. 
ASC > 
 Syn = 
 controls). The effect size contrasting synaesthetes and controls on attention to detail was large 
(d = 
 1.0; t(90.6) = 
 4.809, p < 
 0.001 with Levene’s correction) and the difference survives Bonferroni correction for 
multiple comparisons (i.e.α < 
 0.05/15). The other significant differences (between ASC and the other samples) 
also survived multiple comparisons.
Mealor et al.17 also report that synaesthetes score higher on attention to detail (referred to in that study as local 
processing bias) on a questionnaire that contains items from the AQ. The effect was greater in sequence-space 
synaesthesia than grapheme-colour synaesthesia. Within our sample of synaesthetes, there is some evidence that 
sequence-space synaesthesia may be particularly relevant to the AQ attention-to-detail score (SSS mean = 
 7.32, 
SD = 
 1.67; non-SSS mean = 
 5.71, SD = 
 1.60; t(33) = 
 2.284, p = 
 0.029), suggesting that these subtypes need more 
careful contrasting in future research. By comparison, splitting our synaesthetes in this way had no significant 
impact on the overall GSQ scores (SSS mean = 
 67.3, SD = 
 24.2; non-SSS mean = 
 56.3, SD = 
 18.4; t(33) = 
 1.123, 
p = 0.270) suggesting that sensory sensitivity is not strongly tied to the presence of sequence-space synaesthesia.

In summary, synaesthetes differ from controls on both a measure of sensory sensitivity (linked to autism) and 
on a broader measure of autistic tendencies (AQ) and, again, this was particularly apparent with regards to the 
perceptual features of autism (attention to detail/local processing).

tant to note that the participants of this study, synaesthetes and controls, reported a low incidence of migraine

with aura (syns = 4.3%, controls = 9.4%) and migraine without aura (syns = 8.7%, controls = 13.2%) and did not 
differ from each other in this regard (Fisher’s test p = 
 0.634; and p-.688 respectively), as noted by a previous 
study34.
The results of the Pattern Glare Test are summarised in Fig. 4 for the two standard measures on this test (total 
number of experiences reported and level of visual comfort) and for the novel measure that we introduced (num-
ber of colours reported).
The comfort rating scale is an 11-point measure that was treated as a parametric variable. A 2 × 
 3 
ANOVA contrasting group (synaesthetes v. controls) and spatial frequency (high, medium, low) revealed 
a main effect of group (F(1,58) = 
 3.996, p = 
 0.050, η 
p
2 = 
 0.064), a main effect of spatial frequency 
(F(2,116) = 
 10.673, p < 
 0.001, η 
p
2 = 
 0.155), but no interaction (F(2,116) = 
 0.767, p = 
 0.467, η 
p
2 = 
 0.013). 
The effect of spatial frequency replicates many previous results showing that mid- and high spatial fre-
quency gratings are linked to more visual discomfort than low frequency29,35. The main effect of synaesthe-
sia reflects quantitatively higher level of visual discomfort for this group. In terms of the qualitative pattern, 
the synaesthetes reverse their ratings from ‘comfortable’ for low spatial frequency to ‘uncomfortable’ for the 
mid and high frequency patterns.
The number of experiences reported for each stimulus was low and treated non-parametrically. The (baseline) 
low spatial frequency condition was subtracted from the number of experiences reported to each of the mid- and 
high spatial frequencies. Synaesthetes reported significantly more visual experiences than controls to both the 
mid- (independent samples median test, p = 0.023) and high (p = 0.025) spatial frequencies even after this base-
line correction (i.e. they were not globally higher across all stimuli).

The comparable analysis on total number of colours reported did not yield a difference between synaesthetes 
and controls for the mid (p = 
 0.458) or high (p = 
 0.681) spatial frequency stimuli relative to baseline of low spatial 
frequency. This reflects a generally higher tendency for the synaesthetes to report colours being induced across 
all stimuli.
How is performance on the Pattern Glare Test related to the AQ and GSQ? This was examined by correlating 
the measures from the Pattern Glare Test with the overall AQ and GSQ questionnaire scores (in the combined 
synaesthete and control sample). The predictions were that the GSQ should be related to visual disturbances/
discomfort for the mid-frequency stimulus and possibly the high-frequency stimulus, but not the low-frequency 
stimulus. These analyses should be considered as exploratory given the large number of correlations that do not 
survive correction for multiple comparisons. The AQ did not correlate with any other measures (all p’s > 
 0.10) 
but the GSQ correlated with two measures and showed one non-significant trend (all other p’s > 
 0.10; see 
Supplementary Material). There were significant correlations between GSQ score and number of experiences 
reported to the mid-frequency stimulus (r = 
 0.329, p = 
 0.007) and the GSQ score and the number of colours to 
the mid-frequency stimulus (r = 
 0.273, p = 
 0.028), with a trend between the GSQ score and number of colours 
reported to the high frequency stimulus (r = 0.207, p = 0.098). Recall that it is the mid-frequency stimulus that is 
generally considered to be the most reliable inducer of the highest levels of visual stress36.
Discussion
Two previous studies have found an increased prevalence of synaesthesia in autism9,10. The aim of this study was 
to take the novel and complementary approach of looking for autistic-related traits in synaesthetes. We focussed 
on sensory sensitivity given: the sensory-like experiences of synaesthetes; the evidence for hyper-excitability of 
the visual cortex in synaesthetes25; and behavioral enhancement of sensory discrimination in synaesthetes27. We 
found that grapheme-colour synaesthetes, like people with autism, scored higher on a questionnaire measure 
of sensory sensitivity (the GSQ) and showed a qualitatively similar pattern to the autism group (i.e. both hyper- 
and hypo- sensitivities across multiple senses) albeit quantitatively intermediate between the control and autistic 
group. We suggest that sensory sensitivity is an important link between these two conditions. Future research will 
need to establish whether this is the main (or indeed only) link between them. Although we show that synaes-
thetes do show elevated autistic traits in other domains (using the AQ) this was most strongly driven by the 
subscale relating to perception (‘attention to detail’ which concerns local perceptual processing). Finally, we cor-
roborate these self-report measures using a psychophysical test that is sensitive to various clinical conditions 
linked to visual discomfort29. Previous research shows that those with very high visual discomfort in everyday 
life show a peak number of experiences to the mid-frequency stimulus, but those with moderate degrees of visual 
discomfort find the higher spatial frequency to be more potent36. (In both cases, the low spatial frequency stim-
ulus acts as a control). The synaesthetes showed evidence of visual stress to both high and mid spatial frequency 
stimuli. This links to previous research showing enhanced visual-evoked potentials (in EEG) to mid (5 cycles per 
degree), but not low, spatial frequency gratings26. The participants, as a group, showed a significant correlation 
between GSQ scores and the number of induced experiences to the mid-frequency (but not high or low) stimulus. 
The results cannot be explained as a simple response bias because all three tests show a condition X group interac-
tion. On the Pattern Glare Test we found effects for mid/high spatial frequency but not low spatial frequency. On 
the AQ and GSQ we found stronger effects on some subscales than others.
The mechanism that underpins changes in subjective sensory sensitivity is not well understood. Some models 
have attempted to link sensory sensitivity to enhanced performance on tests of perception. Baron-Cohen et al.37 
suggested that perceptual hyper-sensitivity drives attention-to-detail that, in turn, drives systemizing (or the drive 
for pattern recognition and pattern creation) and can lead to savant talents. A similar account, termed Enhanced 
Perceptual Function (EPF), has been proposed by Mottron et al.38 who explicitly draw a parallel between the 
perceptual abilities of both synaesthetes and people with autism. However, the relationship between subjective 
sensitivity and objective perceptual ability is unlikely to be a simple one39, and it is harder to explain the presence 
of increased hyposensitivity within these frameworks that link hypersensitivity with ability39. It is possible that 
what is termed ‘hyposensitivity’ results from an interest in the sensations produced by sensory-motor repetition, 
such as repeated finger flicking.
Turning to synaesthesia, it is known that synaesthetes show better performance on certain perceptual tests, 
and this appears to be related to the type of synaesthesia they experience. Thus, synaesthetic experiences of touch 
are linked to increased tactile spatial acuity and synaesthetic experiences of color are linked to better color dis-
crimination27. Although the present study was not able to consider different subtypes of synaesthesia in detail, it is 
noteworthy that our grapheme-color synaesthetes still report differences in sensory modalities that are rarely (e.g. 
gustatory, olfactory, vestibular) seen in synaesthesia. It may be that altered sensory sensitivity across all the senses 
is a general feature of the synaesthetic brain. If so, we would predict the same pattern of subjective sensitivity 
reported here will be found for very different types of synaesthesia (e.g. lexical-gustatory).
Further research is needed to explore the underpinning mechanisms behind ‘attention to detail’ by comparing 
people with autism to different forms of synaesthesia (and pulling apart the contribution of grapheme-color and 
sequence-space synaesthesia given that both were present in our sample). Grapheme-color synaesthetes have 
been shown to be good at detecting a hidden figure made up of local elements (e.g. a triangle made up of 2 s) in a 
larger array of different elements (5 s)40,41. The standard explanation for this is that their synaesthetic colors ena-
ble them to ‘see’ the hidden shape. Ward et al.40 provided some direct evidence for this: those synaesthetes who 
reported seeing many synaesthetic colors did better. However, even those synaesthetes who reported no synaes-
thetic colors during the trials outperformed controls. A novel suggestion is that this reflects the ability to group 
local elements that resembles the perceptual abilities found in autism42.

Superficially, autism and synaesthesia seem like very different conditions and the differences between the con-
ditions are as important to explain as the similarities. Learning disability, defined as an IQ less than 70, is present in 
around a third of cases of autism and, moreover, autism is around three times as common in males43. Synaesthesia 
has traditionally been considered more as a ‘gift’ (rather than linked to intellectual dysfunction) and with no male 
bias44. Our focus on the similarity in sensory sensitivity/functioning between autism and synaesthesia may offer an 
account of these superficial differences insofar as sensory sensitivity is not linked to gender differences.
There are various limitations of the present research that require further research to address. It is not yet 
known how people with autism would respond to the Pattern Glare Test and, more generally, it is important to 
use a wider range of visual and non-visual stimuli and determine how this is linked to sensory sensitivity (both 
subjectively, behaviorally and neurophysiologically). The use of internet-based studies has the disadvantage of 
potentially introducing sources of noise into the data (which in themselves are unlikely to lead to between-group 
differences), but have the advantage of enabling us to recruit larger samples of rare populations and is becoming 
more common in perception research45.
Sensory sensitivity has, in various accounts, been linked to cognitive abilities found in autism such as savant 
skills37,38,46. Whilst these theories emphasise a link between sensory sensitivity and some of the positive features of 
autism (e.g. savantism), other theories (such as Intense World Theory47) suggest a causal link between increased sensory 
sensitivity and impaired social functioning (e.g. social withdrawal). Our results are more consistent with the former 
rather than the latter theoretical approach. More generally, our study attests to the value of considering synaesthesia 
alongside autism to explore the relationship between perceptual, cognitive and social symptoms and abilities.

This research was given ethical approval through the Cross-Schools Science and Technology Research Ethics 
Committee at the University of Sussex. The research was carried out in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the 
World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) and informed consent was obtained for all participants.
Participants. 
The synaesthetes were recruited via a database of volunteers held by the University of Sussex. 
This consisted of 35 participants (5 males, 29 females, 1 undisclosed; mean age = 
 28.9, SD = 
 10.5). All participants 
had grapheme-color synaesthesia (verified using the method described in Rothen et al.48), and most (N = 
 28) also 
reported sequence-space synaesthesia. Seventy-eight participants with ASC were recruited from the Cambridge 
Autism Research Database (CARD) (33 males, 45 females; mean age = 
 36.2 years, SD = 
 9.2). They had all received 
a formal diagnosis of autism according to DSM-IV, DSM-5 or ICD-10 criteria and, where tested, scored high on 
a screening measure of autism, the AQ, conducted prior to this study (mean 40.2, SD = 
 5.3, range = 
 22–48; AQ 
scores unavailable for 12 participants in the autism sample). There were 86 control participants (28 males, 58 
females; mean age = 
 32.8, SD = 
 14.1) who were recruited from a mixture of sources including non-ASC volun-
teers from CARD (http://www. cambridgepsychol ogy. com (N = 
 28) and via opportunistic sampling from the 
researchers (N = 58). All participants took part voluntarily without financial compensation.
Procedure. 
All participants were tested online and remotely. For the participants recruited from Cambridge (ASC 
and controls), they were given a link to a Qualtrics survey, an online data collection platform. The survey included the 
GSQ followed by a set of other questions not part of the present study (concerning savant abilities). For the participants 
recruited from Sussex (synaesthetes and controls) they were given a link to a Qualtrics survey that included the GSQ, 
the AQ, and the Pattern Glare Test. They were additionally asked basic questions about their medical history including 
the presence of migraine, with and without aura. The details of each measure are described in turn below.
The Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire (GSQ) consists of 42 items, and investigates sensitivities across seven 
sensory modalities: visual, olfactory, auditory, gustatory, tactile, vestibular, and proprioceptive22. Each modality 
is assessed by six items, in which sensory hyposensitivity and hypersensitivity were determined by three ques-
tions each. All questions asked participants how frequently they experienced a sensory event and/or performed a 
particular behavior, and items were answered using a five-point scale (Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Always). 
Example items included “Do you find certain noises or pitches of sound annoying?”
, “Do bright lights ever hurt 
your eyes or cause a headache?” and “Do you ever feel ill just from smelling a certain odour?” Responses were 
coded on a scale from 0 (Never) to 4 (Always), with possible scores ranging from 0 to 168.
The Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) is a 50-item questionnaire used to measure traits associated with the 
autistic spectrum in adults of normal intelligence20. The AQ contained 10 statements tapping five different sub-
scales: social skill, attention switching, attention to detail, imagination, and communication. Participants demon-
strated their level of agreement with each statement using a four-point scale (Definitely Agree, Slightly Agree, 
Slightly Disagree, Definitely Disagree). Example items included “I find it hard to make new friends”
, “It does not 
upset me if my daily routine is disturbed” and “I find it difficult to imagine what it would be like to be someone 
else”
. Approximately half the questions are reverse coded. Each item scored one point if the respondent recorded 
an autistic-like behavior (poor social skill, poor attention switching/strong focus of attention, exceptional atten-
tion to detail, poor imagination, poor communication skill), either slightly or definitely. Therefore, responses were 
coded as either 0 or 1, and total scores ranged from 0 to 50.
The Pattern Glare Test used the same achromatic stimuli and same basic procedure as Braithwaite et al.35. In 
order to present the stimuli under controlled conditions, the Qualtrics survey took participants to a link con-
taining the test hosted by Inquisit (www.millisecond.com). Participants were informed that they should not par-
ticipate if they had a history of epilepsy. The stimuli consisted of black and white alternating horizontal stripes 
presented in an oval window around a small fixation point and against a mid-grey (RGB 128,128,128) back-
ground. The low-, mid-, and high- spatial frequency stimuli comprised of 4.5, 31.5 and 130 cycles (i.e. stripes) 
which, when viewed at the appropriate distance, corresponded to 0.4, 3.0, and 12.4 cycles per degree. The stimuli 
were always presented centrally at their actual resolution of 652 × 
 500 pixels. Inquisit can determine the resolution

of the monitor used by participants but not the physical size. To standardize viewing distances, participants were 
asked to input the physical size of their monitor (it was explained that this is measured diagonally from corner 
to corner). They were then instructed how far to sit from the monitor (in centimetres and inches) such that each 
stimulus subtends approximately 10.5 degrees in height. Although we are unable to assess compliance with view-
ing instructions, our interest lies in the relative differences across both stimuli and groups. Moreover, it would 
take a very large error in viewing distance to move the 3 cycle per degree stimulus outside of the desired range 
of 2–5 cycles per degree. Participants were informed that they should concentrate on the central fixation dot and 
they would see stripy patterns that, for some people, may elicit experiences such as colors, shimmering or shapes. 
They were reassured that there is no right or wrong answer. The stimuli were presented for 5 seconds in a random 
order. Following each stimulus they were asked three questions. First, they were asked how many experiences 
they had to the stimulus by checking as many or as few options as they liked (colors, bending of lines, blurring 
of lines, shimmer/flicker, fading, shadowy shapes, other/specify). As in previous research, the total number of 
experiences reported is summed (i.e. a score of 0 to 7). The second question was specifically introduced because 
of our interest in color experiences and asked participants to report the colors that they experienced selecting as 
many or few as they liked (yellow, red, green, blue, purple, pink, brown, orange). The final question asked how 
uncomfortable they found it on an 11-point visual analogue scale with endpoints marked as “extremely uncom-
fortable” (left) and “extremely comfortable” (right). The pointer was initially set at the centre (labelled as “neither 
comfortable nor uncomfortable”) and participants dragged the pointer with the mouse to indicate their response.
Analysis. 
The analyses consisted of a between-groups comparison conducted as a 3 X N ANCOVA with gen-
der and age as covariates. For main group results on a single measure N = 
 1 and, when considering specific sub-
scales (AQ, GSQ) or stimulus parameters (PGT) then N > 1.
