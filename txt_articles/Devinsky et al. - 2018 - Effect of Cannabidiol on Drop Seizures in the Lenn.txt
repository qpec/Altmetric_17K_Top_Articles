BACKGROUND
Cannabidiol has been used for treatment-resistant seizures in patients with severe 
early-onset epilepsy. We investigated the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol added to 
a regimen of conventional antiepileptic medication to treat drop seizures in patients 
with the Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, a severe developmental epileptic encephalopathy.
METHODS
In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 30 clinical centers, we ran-
domly assigned patients with the Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (age range, 2 to 55 years) 
who had had two or more drop seizures per week during a 28-day baseline period to 
receive cannabidiol oral solution at a dose of either 20 mg per kilogram of body weight 
(20-mg cannabidiol group) or 10 mg per kilogram (10-mg cannabidiol group) or 
matching placebo, administered in two equally divided doses daily for 14 weeks. The 
primary outcome was the percentage change from baseline in the frequency of drop 
seizures (average per 28 days) during the treatment period.
RESULTS
A total of 225 patients were enrolled; 76 patients were assigned to the 20-mg cannabi-
diol group, 73 to the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 76 to the placebo group. During 
the 28-day baseline period, the median number of drop seizures was 85 in all trial 
groups combined. The median percent reduction from baseline in drop-seizure fre-
quency during the treatment period was 41.9% in the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 37.2% 
in the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 17.2% in the placebo group (P 
= 
0.005 for the 20-mg 
cannabidiol group vs. placebo group, and P 
= 
0.002 for the 10-mg cannabidiol group vs. 
placebo group). The most common adverse events among the patients in the cannabi-
diol groups were somnolence, decreased appetite, and diarrhea; these events occurred 
more frequently in the higher-dose group. Six patients in the 20-mg cannabidiol group 
and 1 patient in the 10-mg cannabidiol group discontinued the trial medication because 
of adverse events and were withdrawn from the trial. Fourteen patients who received 
cannabidiol (9%) had elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations.
CONCLUSIONS
Among children and adults with the Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, the addition of canna-
bidiol at a dose of 10 mg or 20 mg per kilogram per day to a conventional antiepileptic 
regimen resulted in greater reductions in the frequency of drop seizures than placebo. 
Adverse events with cannabidiol included elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations.

Cannabidiol in the Lennox–Gastaut Syndrome
T
he Lennox–Gastaut syndrome is a 
severe developmental epileptic encepha-
lopathy that has multiple causes and an 
incidence of approximately two cases per 100,000 
population.1 The disorder is characterized by 
several seizure types, severe cognitive impair-
ment, and an abnormal electroencephalographic 
pattern of slow spike-and-wave complexes.2 
Seizures usually begin to occur before the age of 
8 years and persist into adulthood in more than 
90% of patients3-5 Drop seizures due to an in-
crease in (tonic) or loss of (atonic) motor tone 
are characteristic of this disorder and often re-
sult in serious injury.6 Six medications are ap-
proved to treat seizures in patients with this 
syndrome. Despite treatment, disabling seizures 
continue to occur in most patients.7
Cannabidiol has been shown to reduce the 
frequency of seizures in animal models of epi-
lepsy. Open-label data from a trial of a plant-
derived pharmaceutical formulation of cannabi-
diol suggest that this medication may be effective 
in drug-resistant cases of epilepsy.8 A random-
ized, controlled trial showed that cannabidiol 
significantly reduced the frequency of seizures 
among children and young adults with the Dravet 
syndrome, another form of developmental epilep-
tic encephalopathy.9 We performed a multicenter, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
to assess the efficacy and safety of two doses of 
cannabidiol, as compared with placebo, added to 
a regimen of conventional antiepileptic medica-
tion to treat drop seizures in patients with the 
Lennox–Gastaut syndrome.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
We conducted this phase 3, multicenter, random-
ized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 
30 participating centers (20 in the United States, 
5 in Spain, 3 in the United Kingdom, and 2 in 
France). Patients were recruited from June 8 to 
December 15, 2015. Patients were followed for up 
to 24 weeks. The trial comprised a 4-week base-
line period, a 14-week treatment period (2 weeks 
of dose escalation, followed by 12 weeks of stable 
dosing [maintenance phase]), a tapering period 
of up to 10 days, and a 4-week safety follow-up 
period after discontinuation of cannabidiol or pla-
cebo (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, avail-
able with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).
The protocol, available at NEJM.org, was ap-
proved by the institutional review board or inde-
pendent ethics committee at each participating 
center. All the patients or their caregivers provid-
ed written informed consent, and children pro-
vided assent when possible. A data and safety 
monitoring committee monitored patient safety, 
and an adjudication board assessed any signs of 
potential abuse of the cannabidiol trial medica-
tion. The trial was conducted in accordance with 
the ethical standards in the International Con-
ference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Prac-
tice guidelines. All the authors vouch for the 
accuracy and completeness of the reported out-
come data and adverse events and for the fidel-
ity of the trial to the protocol. The cannabidiol 
and placebo used in the trial were provided by 
the sponsor (GW Pharmaceuticals). The manu-
script was written by the authors, three of whom 
were employees of GW Pharmaceuticals.
Patients
Patients with the Lennox–Gastaut syndrome were 
eligible for inclusion in the trial if they were 
between 2 and 55 years of age; had an electro-
encephalogram that showed a pattern of slow 
(<3.0 Hz) spike-and-wave complexes, which is 
characteristic of the disorder; and had at least 
two types of generalized seizures, including 
drop seizures, for at least 6 months. A drop sei-
zure was defined as an epileptic seizure (atonic, 
tonic, or tonic–clonic) involving the entire body, 
trunk, or head that leads or could lead to a fall, 
injury, or slumping in a chair. Eligible patients 
were taking between one and four antiepileptic 
drugs and had at least two drop seizures each 
week during the baseline period. All medication 
doses and nonpharmacologic interventions for 
epilepsy (including ketogenic diet and vagus nerve 
stimulation) had to be stable in the 4 weeks 
before screening and throughout the trial. Key 
exclusion criteria were unstable medical condi-
tions during the 4 weeks before screening, a his-
tory of alcohol or substance abuse, use of recre-
ational or medicinal cannabis in the previous 
3 months, use of corticotropins in the previous 
6 months, or current use of felbamate for less 
than 1 year.
Procedures

screening, and those who met the eligibility crite-

ria were randomly assigned to one of three trial 
groups at a subsequent visit within 28 to 31 days 
after the screening visit. A computer-generated 
block randomization schedule, with block sizes 
of six, was produced by an independent statisti-
cian and held at a central location. An interactive 
voice-response or Web-based response system 
was used to randomly assign the patients, in a 
2:2:1:1 ratio, to receive cannabidiol at a dose of 
either 20 mg per kilogram of body weight per 
day (the 20-mg cannabidiol group) or 10 mg per 
kilogram per day (the 10-mg cannabidiol group) 
or matching placebo administered at a volume 
equivalent to that for either the 20-mg cannabi-
diol dose or the 10-mg dose (the placebo group). 
The active treatment was a plant-derived phar-
maceutical formulation of purified cannabidiol 
oral solution (100 mg per milliliter). Cannabidiol 
and the matching placebo solution (excipients 
alone) were provided in identical 100-ml amber 
glass bottles.
The cannabidiol or placebo was administered 
orally twice daily in equally divided doses start-
ing at 2.5 mg per kilogram per day and increas-
ing by 2.5 to 5.0 mg per kilogram every other day 
until the target dose was reached. Patients or 
their caregivers were trained to record, using an 
interactive voice-response system, the number 
and type of seizures, including drop seizures, 
that occurred each day. They also recorded in 
paper diaries cannabidiol or placebo use, use of 
concomitant medications, and adverse events that 
occurred during the treatment and follow-up 
periods. Clinic visits occurred at 2, 4, 8, and 14 
weeks after randomization; additional telephone 
calls to assess the use of concomitant medica-
tions and adverse events were made at 6 weeks 
and 10 weeks, after tapering of the cannabidiol 
or placebo was completed, and at 4 weeks after 
the final dose was administered (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Patients who complet-
ed the treatment period could enter an open-label 
extension trial under a separate protocol (Clinical-
Trials.gov number, NCT02224573). Information 
on deviations from the protocol is provided in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was the percentage change 
from baseline in the frequency of drop seizures 
(average per 28 days) during the treatment period. 
An independent committee of experts from the Epi-
lepsy Study Consortium (http://epilepsyconsortium 
. 
org) reviewed the patients’ documented history 
of seizures and any new seizure types reported 
during the treatment period.
Key secondary outcomes were the percentage 
of patients who had at least a 50% reduction 
from baseline in drop-seizure frequency; the per-
centage change from baseline in the frequency 
of all types of seizures (total seizures); and the 
Patient or Caregiver Global Impression of Change 
from baseline in overall condition, as assessed 
on a 7-point scale that included three categories 
of improvement (slightly improved, much im-
proved, or very much improved), three categories 
of worsening (slightly worse, much worse, or 
very much worse), and an option of “no change.” 
These measures were prespecified as key sec-
ondary outcomes in the statistical analysis plan 
(available with the protocol) but not in the pro-
tocol. The analysis of the percentage of patients 
who had at least a 50% reduction from baseline 
in drop-seizure frequency was included as a key 
secondary outcome at the request of the Euro-
pean Medicines Agency.
Other secondary outcomes included the per-
centage of patients who had at least a 25%, at 
least a 75%, and a 100% reduction from baseline 
in drop-seizure frequency; the percentage of 
patients who had worsening or improvement in 
drop-seizure frequency during the treatment 
period; the percent reduction from baseline in 
the frequencies of nondrop seizures (all seizures 
except drop seizures), convulsive seizures (tonic–
clonic, tonic, clonic, or atonic seizures), noncon-
vulsive seizures (myoclonic seizures, easily iden-
tifiable partial seizures because of a motor 
component, other partial seizures, or absence 
seizures), and individual seizures according to 
type; the Patient or Caregiver Global Impression 
of Change in Seizure Duration from baseline 
(decreased, stayed the same, or increased); the 
change from baseline in sleep disruption, as as-
sessed on a scale from 0 (slept extremely well) to 
10 (unable to sleep at all); the change from base-
line in the score on the Epworth Sleepiness 
Scale10 (range, 0 to 24, with higher scores indi-
cating greater daytime sleepiness); the change 
from baseline in the score on the Quality of Life 
in Childhood Epilepsy questionnaire11 (range, 0 to 
100, with higher scores indicating better func-
tion); the change from baseline in the score on 
the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, second

edition (Vineland-II; range, 20 to 160, with higher 
scores indicating better behavioral adaptation); 
and safety. The severity and causality of adverse 
events were determined by the investigators and 
were not independently adjudicated. The statisti-
cal analysis plan included additional secondary 
outcomes that were not analyzed because they 
had a low frequency of events, had low participa-
tion, or were introduced late in the conduct of 
the trial.
Statistical Analysis
On the basis of previously reported placebo ef-
fects on seizure rates in other trials involving 
patients with the Lennox–Gastaut syndrome12,13 
and allowing for a slightly greater placebo effect 
because of a higher expectation of effect with 
cannabidiol than with other agents, we assumed 
that the patients assigned to receive placebo 
would have a mean 18% reduction from baseline 
in drop-seizure frequency and that patients as-
signed to receive cannabidiol would have a mean 
50% reduction. We calculated that 50 patients 
per trial group would provide 80% power to 
detect a 32 percentage-point difference between 
the cannabidiol group and the placebo group at 
a two-tailed significance level of 5%. Because of 
the rapid recruitment after notification of pend-
ing closure of recruitment, more patients under-
went randomization than originally planned.
The primary outcome was analyzed with the 
use of a Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and the esti-
mated median difference (with 95% confidence 
intervals) between the trial groups was calculated 
with the use of the Hodges–Lehmann approach. 
Hypotheses were tested in the following order: 
the 20-mg cannabidiol group, followed by the 
10-mg cannabidiol group, was compared with 
the placebo group with respect to the primary 
outcome; the 20-mg cannabidiol group was then 
compared with the placebo group with respect 
to each key secondary outcome in the order 
listed above, and then the 10-mg cannabidiol 
group was compared with the placebo group 
with respect to each key secondary outcome in 
the same order. For the primary and key second-
ary outcomes only, the type I error was con-
trolled by a hierarchical gate-keeping procedure, 
wherein each successive outcome was tested 
only if the preceding comparison was significant 
at a two-sided P value of 0.05.
The percentage of patients who had a response 
(≥50%, ≥75%, and 100% reductions in seizure fre-
quency) was analyzed with the use of a Cochran–
Mantel–Haenszel test that was stratified accord-
ing to age group. An odds ratio (when applicable) 
with 95% confidence intervals is also presented. 
The median percentage change in the frequency 
of seizures (total, nondrop, convulsive, noncon-
vulsive, and individual seizures by type) was 
analyzed with the same methods as those used 
in the primary outcome analysis. Patient or Care-
giver Global Impression of Change (overall con-
dition and seizure duration) was analyzed with 
the use of ordinal logistic regression that includ-
ed trial group (for analysis of overall condition 
and seizure duration) and age group (for analy-
sis of seizure duration only) as factors. The sec-
ondary outcomes of sleep disruption, Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale, and Quality of Life in Child-
hood Epilepsy were assessed with the use of an 
analysis of covariance that included baseline 
scores and age group as covariates and trial 
group assignment as a fixed factor.
For patients who withdrew from the trial, 
data up to the time of withdrawal were included 
in the outcome analyses, and no imputation for 
missing data was performed. The monthly fre-
quency of seizures during the treatment period 
was calculated with the use of available data 
from day 1 through day 99 or of available data 
at the time of the last dose of cannabidiol or 
placebo if the patient was withdrawn from the 
trial. Monthly frequency of seizures was calculat-
ed according to the following formula: ([number 
of seizures in the period] 
÷ 
[number of days re-
ported in the interactive response system in the 
period]) 
× 
28. Sensitivity analyses were performed 
for the primary and key secondary outcomes, 
including one in which missing data from the 
days that were not reported in the interactive 
response system were imputed as the highest 
number of seizures for each patient according to 
the last observation carried forward, the next 
observation carried backward, and the mean 
number of daily seizures during the treatment 
period (calculated from nonmissing data) (Figs. 
S2 to S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). For 
the secondary outcomes other than the key sec-
ondary outcomes, the type 1 error was not con-
trolled, and thus only descriptive statistics and 
95% confidence intervals are reported. Analyses 
were performed with SAS software, version 9.3 
(SAS Institute).

Results
Patients
A total of 293 patients were assessed for eligibility 
at 30 clinical centers; 68 were excluded (Fig. 1). 
The remaining 225 patients underwent random-
ization, of whom 76 were assigned to the 20-mg 
cannabidiol group, 73 to the 10-mg cannabidiol 
group, and 76 to the placebo group; all patients 
received at least one dose of cannabidiol or 
placebo. A total of 13 patients (6%) discontinued 
either cannabidiol (11 patients) or placebo (2 pa-
tients); in 7 of the 11 patients who discontinued 
cannabidiol, the treatment was discontinued be-
cause of adverse events. Baseline characteristics 
were similar in the trial groups (Table 1); the 
majority of patients were white and were from 
the United States, and 30% were older than 18 
years of age (Table S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Patients in each group had previously 
received a median of 6 antiepileptic drugs 
(range, 0 to 22), but the drugs had failed to con-
trol the seizures; the patients were receiving a 
median of 3 antiepileptic drugs concomitantly at 
Figure 1. Screening, Randomization, and Treatment Period.
Patients were randomly assigned to receive cannabidiol at a dose of 20 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, cannabidiol at a dose  
of 10 mg per kilogram per day, or placebo. Among the 23 patients who had some “other reason” for exclusion, 12 had a change of inves-
tigator, 5 did not adhere to the use of the interactive voice-response system, 4 did not meet inclusion criteria or met exclusion criteria,  
1 had a change in a concomitant antiepileptic drug, and 1 did not meet the randomization window. Six patients in the 10-mg cannabidiol 
group temporarily received a dose that was above the target and were therefore included in the 20-mg cannabidiol group for the safety 
analysis. Among the 9 patients who discontinued treatment in the 20-mg cannabidiol group, the one patient who met withdrawal criteria 
and the one patient who had a protocol deviation also had adverse events leading to discontinuation. Withdrawals are shown according 
to the primary reason reported for each patient.

Cannabidiol in the Lennox–Gastaut Syndrome
the time of trial entry. The most common anti-
epileptic drug was clobazam (49% of all pa-
tients). The median number of drop seizures 
during the 28-day baseline period was 85 across 
all groups. Of the 212 patients who completed 
the treatment period, 210 (99%) entered the 
open-label extension trial.
Primary Outcome
The median percent reduction from baseline in the 
frequency of drop seizures per 28 days during 
the treatment period was 41.9% in the 20-mg 
cannabidiol group, 37.2% in the 10-mg cannabi-
diol group, and 17.2% in the placebo group. The 
estimated median difference in reduction be-
tween the 20-mg cannabidiol group and the 
placebo group was 21.6 percentage points (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 6.7 to 34.8; P 
= 
0.005), 
and the estimated median difference in reduc-
tion between the 10-mg cannabidiol group and 
the placebo group was 19.2 percentage points 
(95% CI, 7.7 to 31.2; P 
= 
0.002) (Fig. 2).
The results of the sensitivity analyses, includ-
ing those performed to account for missing data, 
were consistent with the results of the primary 
analysis (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The differences between trial groups favored can-
nabidiol over placebo during the first 4 weeks of 
the maintenance phase and persisted through-
out the treatment period.
Key Secondary Outcomes
During the treatment period, a total of 30 pa-
tients (39%) in the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 26 
patients (36%) in the 10-mg cannabidiol group, 
and 11 patients (14%) in the placebo group had 
at least a 50% reduction from their baseline in 
drop-seizure frequency (odds ratio for the 20-mg

(Fig. 3). The direction of these findings was 
consistent in the sensitivity analyses (Figs. S3 
and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
percentage of patients who had at least a 75% 
reduction from baseline in drop-seizure fre-
quency was higher in the 20-mg cannabidiol 
group (25%) and the 10-mg cannabidiol group 
(11%) than in the placebo group (3%) (Fig. 3). 
No patients were free from drop seizures during 
the entire treatment period (day 1 onward); how-
ever, 5 patients (7%) in the 20-mg cannabidiol 
group, 3 patients (4%) in the 10-mg cannabidiol 
group, and 1 patient in the placebo group (1%) 
were free from drop seizures during the entire 
maintenance phase (day 15 onward).
The median percent reduction from baseline 
in the frequency of all seizures per 28 days dur-
ing the treatment period was 38.4% in the 20-mg 
cannabidiol group, 36.4% in the 10-mg cannabi-
diol group, and 18.5% in the placebo group. The 
estimated median difference in reduction be-
tween the 20-mg cannabidiol group and the 
placebo group was 18.8 percentage points (95% 
CI, 4.4 to 31.8; P 
= 
0.009), and the estimated 
median difference in reduction between the 10-mg 
cannabidiol group and the placebo group was 
19.5 percentage points (95% CI, 7.5 to 30.4; 
P 
= 
0.002) (Fig. 2). The direction of these find-
ings was consistent in the sensitivity analyses 
(Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
An improvement from baseline in overall con-
dition (slightly improved, much improved, or very 
much improved) according to the Patient or Care-
giver Global Impression of Change at the last 
visit was reported in 43 of 75 patients (57%) in 
the 20-mg cannabidiol group, in 48 of 73 pa-
tients (66%) in the 10-mg cannabidiol group, 
and in 33 of 75 patients (44%) in the placebo 
group (odds ratio for the 20-mg cannabidiol 
group vs. the placebo group, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.02 
to 3.30; P 
= 
0.04; and odds ratio for the 10-mg 
cannabidiol group vs. the placebo group, 2.57; 
95% CI, 1.41 to 4.66; P

Supplementary Appendix).
Figure 2. Median Percent Reductions in Monthly Seizure Frequency during the Treatment Period.
The estimated median differences are for the comparisons between each cannabidiol group and the placebo group 
and were calculated with the use of the Hodges–Lehmann approach. The P values were calculated with the use of a 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Drop seizures are defined as epileptic seizures (atonic, tonic, or tonic–clonic) involving the 
entire body, trunk, or head that lead or could lead to a fall, injury, or slumping in a chair; total seizures were defined 
as all types of seizures combined, and nondrop seizures as all seizures except drop seizures. P values for nondrop 
seizures are not shown because this was not a key secondary outcome, and type 1 error was not controlled.

Cannabidiol in the Lennox–Gastaut Syndrome
Other Secondary Outcomes
The type 1 error was not controlled in the analy-
sis of the other secondary outcomes. Therefore, 
only descriptive statistics and 95% confidence 
are presented in Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
Adverse Events
Six patients in the 10-mg cannabidiol group tem-
porarily received a dose that was above the target 
and were therefore included in the 20-mg can-
nabidiol group for the safety analysis. Adverse 
events were reported in 77 of 82 patients (94%) 
in the 20-mg cannabidiol group, in 56 of 67 pa-
tients (84%) in the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 
in 55 of 76 patients (72%) in the placebo group. 
Reductions in the dose of cannabidiol or placebo 
were permitted if unacceptable adverse events 
occurred, and changes in the doses of concomi-
tant antiepileptic drugs (Table S4 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix) were permitted on clinical 
grounds (e.g., on the basis of adverse events, 
laboratory findings, or plasma levels of concomi-
tant medications). Of the adverse events that 
occurred among the patients, 89% were judged 
by the investigators (without independent adju-
dication) to be of mild or moderate severity. 
Common adverse events included somnolence, 
decreased appetite, diarrhea, upper respiratory 
tract infection, pyrexia, and vomiting (Table 2). 
A total of 8 patients discontinued cannabidiol or 
placebo because of adverse events and were with-
drawn from the trial (6 in the 20-mg cannabi-
diol group, 1 in the 10-mg cannabidiol group, 
and 1 in the placebo group); elevation of serum 
aminotransferase concentrations was the most 
common adverse event among these patients, oc-
curring in 4 of the 6 patients in the 20-mg can-
nabidiol group and in the patient in the 10-mg 
cannabidiol group, with maximum elevations in 
aspartate aminotransferase or alanine amino-
transferase concentrations that were 3.2 to 12.2 
times the upper limit of the normal range. Seri-
ous adverse events were reported in 33 patients 
(13 in each cannabidiol group and 7 in the pla-
cebo group). Among the 26 patients in the can-
nabidiol groups who had serious adverse events, 
the events were considered by the investigator to 
be related to the cannabidiol treatment in 7 pa-
tients (1 patient had multiple events); these events 
included elevated aspartate aminotransferase con-
centration (2 patients), elevated alanine amino-
transferase concentration (1 patient), elevated 
γ-glutamyltransferase concentration (1 patient), 
somnolence (1 patient), increased seizures dur-
ing weaning (1 patient), nonconvulsive status 
epilepticus (1 patient), lethargy (1 patient), con-
stipation (1 patient), and worsening chronic cho-
lecystitis (1 patient). Increases in serum amino-
transferase concentrations greater than 3 times 
the upper limit of the normal range occurred in 
14 of the 149 patients (9%) who received cannabi-
diol (11 patients in the 20-mg group and 3 in the 
10-mg group [no patient in the placebo group 
had such an event]). Of these 14 patients, 11 
(79%; 9 patients in the 20-mg group and 2 in the 
10-mg group) were receiving valproic acid con-
comitantly. No patient met the criteria for severe 
drug-induced liver injury, and all cases of elevat-
ed aminotransferase concentrations greater than 
3 times the upper limit of the normal range re-
solved either spontaneously during the treatment 
period (3 patients), after entry into the open-label 
extension trial (2 patients), or after the dose of 
Figure 3. Reductions of at Least 50% and 75% from Baseline in Drop-Seizure 
Frequency during the Treatment Period.
The odds ratios are for the comparisons between each cannabidiol group 
and the placebo group. The P values were calculated with the use of a 
 
Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test, with stratification according to age group 
(2 to 5 years, 6 to 11 years, 12 to 17 years, and 18 to 55 years). P values for 
reductions of at least 75% from baseline in drop-seizure frequency are not 
shown because this was not a key secondary outcome, and type 1 error 
was not controlled.

cannabidiol was tapered, cannabidiol was dis-
continued, or the dose of another antiepileptic 
drug was reduced (9 patients).
Discussion
This trial involving children and adults with the 
Lennox–Gastaut syndrome showed that a pharma-
ceutical formulation of purified cannabidiol, 
administered at a dose of either 10 mg or 20 mg 
per kilogram per day, resulted in a significantly 
greater reduction in the frequency of drop sei-
zures than placebo. Significant results in favor 
of cannabidiol were also seen in secondary out-
come measures of at least a 50% reduction in the 
frequency of drop seizures, the reduction in the 
frequency of all seizures, and improvement in 
overall condition. Eight patients (5%) who re-
ceived cannabidiol were free from drop seizures 
during the entire maintenance phase, as com-
pared with one patient in the placebo group. 
These results are similar to those from trials of 
cannabidiol at a dose of 20 mg per kilogram per 
day in patients with the Lennox–Gastaut syn-
drome14 and those with the Dravet syndrome.9
A prospective, open-label study of cannabidiol in 
patients with childhood epilepsy of various causes 
showed improvements in several components of 
quality of life.15 However, an overall quality-of-life 
assessment in our trial showed no significant 
difference between cannabidiol and placebo.
The most common adverse events with can-
nabidiol were somnolence, decreased appetite, 
and diarrhea, particularly in the 20-mg cannabi-
diol group.12,16 Serious adverse events and trial 
withdrawal were more common in the cannabi-
diol groups than in the placebo group.5,17 Eleva-
tions in liver aminotransferase concentrations 
greater than three times the upper limit of the 
normal range occurred more frequently among 
the patients who received cannabidiol; most oc-
curred in the 20-mg cannabidiol group and 
among patients receiving valproate concomi-
tantly. A dose-ranging safety study of cannabi-
diol in the treatment of the Dravet syndrome 
showed that cannabidiol had no effect on sys-
temic levels of valproate,18 which suggests that 
any drug–drug interaction between valproate and 
cannabidiol is pharmacodynamic rather than 
pharmacokinetic. Cannabidiol inhibits the cata-
lytic activity of cytochrome P450 2C19 and in-
creases levels of the N-desmethyl metabolite of 
clobazam, which has biologic activity and may 
have contributed to the efficacy of the active 
drug in this trial.19 Approximately half the pa-

The table shows the adverse events that occurred in more than 10% of patients 
in any trial group. The severity of adverse events was determined by the inves-
tigators and was not independently adjudicated. Of the 73 patients who had 
been randomly assigned to the 10-mg cannabidiol group, 6 received a dose 
that was above the target (among whom 3 had somnolence, 3 had decreased 
appetite, and 1 had nasopharyngitis [patients could have >1 adverse event]); 
therefore, these patients were included in the 20-mg cannabidiol group in the 
safety analysis. Of the 3 patients with somnolence in the 10-mg cannabidiol 
group, 1 was taking clobazam concomitantly.
†  
Among the patients with somnolence, 15 of 25 patients (60%) in the 20-mg 
cannabidiol group, 11 of 14 patients (79%) in the 10-mg cannabidiol group, 
and 1 of 4 patients (25%) in the placebo group were taking clobazam con-
comitantly.

Cannabidiol in the Lennox–Gastaut Syndrome
tients in the cannabidiol and placebo groups 
were receiving clobazam concomitantly, and de-
creases in the dose of clobazam occurred more 
frequently among the patients in the cannabidiol 
groups than among those in the placebo group. 
A trial examining the effect of cannabidiol on 
serum concentrations of clobazam is under way 
(NCT02565108).
In the current trial comparing two different 
doses of cannabidiol with placebo in patients 
with the Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, cannabidiol 
was associated with greater reductions in the 
frequencies of drop seizures and all seizures than 
placebo. More adverse events were observed in 
each cannabidiol group than in the placebo group; 
the 10-mg cannabidiol group had a lower inci-
dence of adverse events than the 20-mg group. 
Elevations in liver aminotransferase concentra-
tions occurred in 9% of the patients who received 
cannabidiol.
