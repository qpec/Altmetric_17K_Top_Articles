Among Female US High School Students
Implications for Sexually Transmitted Infection Prevention

IMPORTANCE Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), specifically intrauterine devices
and implants, offers an unprecedented opportunity to reduce unintended pregnancies
among adolescents because it is highly effective even with typical use. However, adolescent
LARC users may be less likely to use condoms for preventing sexually transmitted infections
compared with users of moderately effective contraceptive methods (ie, oral, Depo-Provera
injection, patch, and ring contraceptives).
OBJECTIVE To compare condom use between sexually active female LARC users and users of
moderately effective contraceptive methods.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional analysis using data from the 2013
national Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a nationally representative sample of US high school
students in grades 9 through 12. Descriptive analyses were conducted among sexually active
female students (n = 2288); logistic regression analyses were restricted to sexually active
female users of LARC and moderately effective contraception (n = 619). The analyses were
conducted in July and August 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Contraceptive method at last sexual intercourse was
assessed by 1 item—respondents could select birth control pills; condoms; an intrauterine
device or implant; injection, patch, or ring; withdrawal or other method; or not sure. A
separate item asked whether respondents used a condom at last sexual intercourse. We
created an indicator variable to distinguish those reporting use of (1) LARC (intrauterine
device or implant), (2) oral contraceptives, and (3) Depo-Provera, patch, or ring.
RESULTS Among the 2288 sexually active female participants (56.7% white; 33.6% in 12th
grade), 1.8% used LARC; 5.7% used Depo-Provera, patch, or ring; 22.4% used oral
contraceptives; 40.8% used condoms; 11.8% used withdrawal or other method; 15.7% used
no contraceptive method; and 1.9% were not sure. In adjusted analyses, LARC users were
about 60% less likely to use condoms compared with oral contraceptive users (adjusted
prevalence ratio [aPR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21-0.84). No significant differences in condom use
were observed between LARC users and Depo-Provera injection, patch, or ring users (aPR,
0.57; 95% CI, 0.26-1.25). The LARC users were more than twice as likely to have 2 or more
recent sexual partners compared with oral contraceptive users (aPR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.75-3.90)
and Depo-Provera, patch, or ring users (aPR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.17-5.67).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Observed differences in condom use may reflect motivations
to use condoms for backup pregnancy prevention. Users of highly effective LARC methods
may no longer perceive a need for condoms even if they have multiple sexual partners, which
places them at risk for sexually transmitted infections. As uptake of LARC increases among
adolescents, a clear need exists to incorporate messages about condom use specifically for
sexually transmitted infection prevention.

L
ong-acting reversible contraception (LARC) offers a
promising strategy for reducing unintended preg-
nancy among adolescents aged 15 to 19 years in the
United States, where teen birth rates remain much higher than
many other Western, industrialized countries.1 Long-acting
methods, namely intrauterine devices and implants, are user
independent and thus considerably more effective than con-
traceptive methods for which effectiveness depends on cor-
rect and consistent use. Perfect and typical use failure rates
of LARC are less than 1%, whereas the typical use failure rates
areabout9%fororalcontraceptives,thepatch,orthebirthcon-
trol ring and about 6% for injectable contraception.2 More-
over, contraceptive continuation and satisfaction have been
found to be greater for LARC than these shorter-acting meth-
ods that are only moderately effective with typical use.3 Ac-
cordingly, substantial reductions in teen pregnancies4-6 as well
asdeclinesinabortionrates4havebeenattributedtoLARCuse.
Although only 7.1% of female adolescents seeking contracep-
tiveservicesfromTitleXservicesiteswereusingLARCin2013,
use of LARC among this population appears to be increasing
due to concerted clinical and public health intervention.7 Both
the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Con-
gress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have affirmed the
safety of adolescent LARC use and recommend LARC as a
highly effective contraceptive option for this population.8,9
As often is the case with the advent and scale-up of new
publichealthtechnologies,concernexiststhatincreasingLARC
use among adolescents may have unintended consequences,
namely the decreased use of condoms for preventing sexu-
ally transmitted infections (STIs), including human immuno-
deficiency virus (HIV).10,11 Nearly half of all new STIs occur
among young people aged 15 to 24 years,12 and neither mod-
erately effective contraceptive methods nor LARC protect
against STIs. Use of a highly or moderately effective form of
contraception to avoid pregnancy and a condom to prevent
STIs, including HIV, is thus recommended for sexually active,
heterosexual couples in guidelines from the American Acad-
emy of Pediatrics, the American Congress of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, and the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention/Office of Population Affairs.8,9,13 However, dual use,
as this behavior is often called,14,15 is uncommon among ado-
lescents. According to the 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey
(YRBS), only 8.8% of sexually active high school students re-
ported using a highly or moderately effective contraceptive
method and a condom at last sexual intercourse.16 Although
some studies, including a randomized trial among women in
Jamaica, have found that initiation of a contraceptive im-
plant did not affect subsequent condom use,17,18 other analy-
ses using prospective data from adolescents and reproductive-
aged women have documented declines in condom use
following LARC initiation.19,20
Furthermore,severalanalysessuggestthatLARCusersmay
be less likely to use condoms compared with users of moder-
atelyeffectivemethods.19,21-23 Forexample,oneofthemostre-
cent analyses to consider differences in condom use by contra-
ceptive type, using data from the 2006-2008 National Survey
ofFamilyGrowth,foundthatuseofLARCamongreproductive-
aged women was associated with lower dual-method use com-
paredwithuseoforalcontraceptives.21Giventheevolvingcon-
text of contraceptive recommendations for and use among
adolescents, these associations warrant reexamination among
this population particularly at risk for STIs.
Using a nationally representative sample of US high school
students, this study compares condom use between sexually
active female LARC users and users of moderately effective
contraceptive methods. Establishing the relationship be-
tween LARC and condom use among adolescent LARC users
prior to widespread adolescent uptake will help provide a use-
ful reference point for future monitoring and can ultimately
inform STI prevention efforts as LARC is brought to scale.
Methods
Data Source
Data from the 2013 national YRBS were used for this study, and
the analyses were conducted in July and August 2015. The
sample design and surveillance procedures of the YRBS have
been described in detail elsewhere.24 Briefly, YRBS is admin-
istered biennially using a 3-stage cluster design and a self-
administeredpaperandpencilquestionnaire.Thedataarerep-
resentative of ninth- through 12th-grade students attending
public and private high schools in the 50 states and the Dis-
trict of Columbia. The Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tionInstitutionalReviewBoardreviewedandapprovedthena-
tionalYRBSprocedures.Asasecondaryanalysis,thisstudydid

dent participation in the survey is voluntary, and local paren-
tal permission procedures are used.
Measures
Contraceptive method at last sexual intercourse was as-
sessedbyasingleitemthatasked,“Thelasttimeyouhadsexual
intercourse, what one method did you or your partner use to
prevent pregnancy?” Participants could select only 1 re-
sponse from a list of options that included no method; birth
control pills; condoms; an intrauterine device (such as Mirena
or ParaGard) or implant (such as Implanon or Nexplanon); an
injection (referred to as “shot” in the survey; such as Depo-
Provera), patch (such as Ortho Evra), or birth control ring (such
as NuvaRing); withdrawal or some other method; or not sure.
Key Points
Question: Are adolescent users of long-acting reversible
contraception (LARC) less likely to use condoms than adolescents
using moderately effective contraceptive methods?
Findings: Among a nationally representative sample of sexually
active female US high school students, LARC users were about
60% less likely to use condoms compared with oral contraceptive
users. There were no differences in condom use between those
who used LARC and those who used injection, patch, or ring
contraceptives.
Meaning: As uptake of LARC increases among adolescents, a clear
need exists to incorporate messages about condom use
specifically for prevention of sexually transmitted infections.

We created an indicator variable to distinguish use of (1) LARC
(intrauterinedeviceorimplant),(2)oralcontraceptives(ie,birth
control pills), and (3) Depo-Provera, patch, or ring.
Condom use at last sexual intercourse, the primary out-
comemeasure,wasassessedviaaseparateitem:“Thelasttime
you had sexual intercourse, did you or your partner use a con-
dom?” Several sexual behavior items were examined as sec-
ondaryoutcomes,includingnumberoflifetimepartners,num-
ber of partners during the past 3 months, age at first sexual
intercourse, and use of alcohol or drugs before last sexual in-
tercourse. As is standard practice with YRBS analyses,16 we
used dichotomous measures (yes or no) for 2 or more sexual
partnersduringthepast3monthsand4ormorelifetimesexual
partners. Age at first sexual intercourse was dichotomized to
indicate participants who had sexual intercourse for the first
time before age 13 years.
Statistical Analysis

further restricted regression analyses to sexually active female

limited our analyses to female students because self-report of

Results
The majority of the sample (56.7%) was white and about one-
third of the participants (33.6%) were in 12th grade. Among
these sexually active female students, 29.8% used LARC or a
moderately effective contraceptive method. Overall, 1.8%
used LARC and 5.7% used Depo-Provera injection, patch, or
ring (Table 1). Oral contraceptives were the most common
highly or moderately effective method, with nearly one-
quarter of sexually active female students (22.4%) using this
method. Condom use was the primary method of pregnancy
prevention for 40.8% of the sample, 11.8% used withdrawal
or other method, 15.7% used no contraceptive method, and
1.9% were not sure. Significant differences in the type of con-
traceptive method used by race/ethnicity were identified. For
instance, 30.7% of white sexually active female students
used oral contraceptives, whereas only 7.3% of both their
black and Hispanic counterparts used this method. In addi-
tion, not using a contraceptive method was most common
among Hispanic (23.7%) and black (21.2%) sexually active
female students. Whereas 18.6% of sexually active ninth-
grade female students used LARC or a moderately effective

less than condom use among oral contraceptive users
(P = .001). In adjusted regression analyses (Table 2), LARC us-
ers were nearly 60% less likely to use condoms compared with

those using moderately effective methods.
Discussion
Similar to prior studies that have documented low preva-
lence of condom use with highly or moderately effective
contraceptive methods,15,27-30 our findings point to a need to
improve condom use among all users of highly and moder-
ately effective methods considered, including LARC, oral
contraceptive, and Depo-Provera, patch, or ring users. More-
over, our study highlights that condom use at last sexual
intercourse was even lower among LARC users compared
with oral contraceptive users. Similar findings have been
reported previously for reproductive-aged samples19,21-23
and attributed to women’
s motivations to use condoms as a
backup pregnancy prevention method as one potential
explanation.21,22 Although few studies have assessed moti-
vations for condom use with more effective methods, there
is a conceptual basis to suggest that observed differences in
condom use may be due to perceptions of contraceptive
effectiveness. Given that the effectiveness of oral contracep-
tives depends on consistent, daily use and that missing pills
is a common behavior,31,32 oral contraceptive users may
choose condoms as a second contraceptive option.33 In fact,
it has been suggested that health care professionals could
explicitly promote condoms as backup contraception for
user-dependent hormonal methods as one strategy to
increase rates of dual use.22,34 Adolescents using highly
effective, user-independent LARC methods, however, may
be less likely to use condoms because they do not perceive a
need for additional protection against pregnancy.
The null findings when comparing condom use between
LARC users and Depo-Provera, patch, or ring users may fur-
ther support this conclusion. Although Depo-Provera, the
patch, and the ring are also user-dependent methods, con-
sistent use requires action only quarterly or monthly35,36
rather than daily, as is the case with oral contraceptives.
Accordingly, adolescents may be less likely to perceive or
have a need to use condoms as backup contraception with
these methods, even though typical use failure rates are
fairly similar to oral contraceptives.2 Of course, it is possible
that other explanations may account for the findings related
to condom use. For instance, health care professionals may
be more likely to offer LARC to adolescents who report not
using condoms or using them infrequently, as LARC meth-
ods are particularly well suited for adolescents who have dif-
ficulty adhering to coitally dependent methods, including
condoms. Additionally, we do not know whether the asso-
ciation varies by partnership type; it is possible that the
observed differences occur largely among adolescents who
consider themselves to be in committed partnerships and
thus are less concerned about STIs.
Regardless of the reason for the discrepancy, this associa-
tion between LARC use and condom use is particularly con-
cerning given that STI risk is high during adolescence. Evi-
dence suggests that some health care professionals may
promote and consider LARC methods appropriate for women
who are in stable, mutually monogamous relationships
only.37 However, as LARC is brought to scale as an effective
strategy to decrease unintended pregnancy,4 adolescents in
other kinds of relationships, including noncommitted or
shorter relationships, will be using this method. Therefore,
there is a need to understand health care professionals’per-
ceptions of LARC and how these may influence recommen-
dations to adolescents in comparison with adults. In fact, we

found that students using LARC were more likely to have
multiple sexual partners, both recent and lifetime, compared
with both oral contraceptive users and Depo-Provera, patch,
or ring users. This finding may indicate that female adoles-
cents who are more sexually experienced are being offered
and accepting highly effective contraception. However,
multiple partnerships increase risk of STI acquisition,38,39
making condom use among adolescent LARC users particu-
larly important.
Several limitations should be considered when inter-
preting these findings. The YRBS data are based on partici-
pant self-report and behaviors may be inaccurately
reported40; however, YRBS items have been shown to have
good test-retest reliability.41 Additionally, the survey asks
only about the primary contraceptive method used at last
sexual intercourse; it is possible that some students using
condoms in conjunction with other methods only reported
condoms as their pregnancy prevention method. However,
because a separate item asks specifically about condom use,
this is a minimal concern. More important, information
about the duration of use, correct and consistent use, and
partnership context is not available. Motivations for con-
dom use or use of other strategies specifically for STI pre-
vention (eg, testing, mutual monogamy, human papilloma-
virus vaccination) are also not assessed, and we do not have
information on family income or health insurance status,
which may influence adolescents’contraceptive choices.
The data are cross sectional, which limits causal inference.
Finally, the findings are not generalizable to out-of-school
populations, students in grades other than ninth through
12th, or college students.
Despite these limitations, our analyses use nationally
representative data to highlight the need to continue to
address STI prevention for adolescents in the context of
pregnancy prevention research and practice. The findings
should not deter adolescent LARC scale-up but rather inform
how scale-up occurs. Additional research is needed to
explore motivations for condom use among adolescents,
when used alone and in combination with more effective
contraceptive methods. Evidence to date suggests that
adolescents are motivated to use condoms with other con-
traception for STI prevention if they do not know a partner
well or trust that a partner was monogamous33 or if they
have previously contracted an STI.42 Further research on
partnership context may help inform the tailoring of mes-
sages for adolescents. Such research can be conceptualized
within the framework of dual protection to further distin-
guish the use of condoms with a highly or moderately effec-
tive contraceptive method for 2 potential purposes—to pro-
tect against pregnancy and STIs.
As LARC use increases, counseling and education about
LARC should incorporate messages about condom use, par-
ticularly given that recommendation by health care profes-
sionals to use condoms with oral contraception has been posi-
tively associated with consistent condom use.29 Moreover,
health care professionals should emphasize the importance of
using condoms specifically for STI prevention and help ado-
lescents develop strategies for implementing a coitally depen-
dent method. To do so, health care professionals will need
training and tools to effectively address both pregnancy and
STI prevention and risk assessment within the same clinical
visit. Such resources will help facilitate implementation of the
recommendations for dual protection outlined by the Ameri-
can Academy of Pediatrics, the American Congress of Obste-
tricians and Gynecologists, and the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention/Office of Population Affairs.8,9,13 Building
healthcareprofessionals’skillsandself-efficacytodiscusspart-
nership dynamics and strategies for condom negotiation will
be especially useful, as promoting the use of condoms for STI
prevention may raise concerns about stigma, mistrust, and
infidelity.14,34 Clinic-level strategies may also be needed to re-
tain adolescent LARC users in routine preventive care where
they can receive prevention counseling, condoms, and rec-
ommended STI screening, especially if future research indi-
cates that LARC users are less likely to access sexual health–
relatedclinicalservices.Also,sexualhealtheducationprograms
implemented in school or community settings can strengthen
messages about the importance of condom use for STI pre-

Conclusions
There is a clear need for a concerted effort to improve con-
dom use among adolescent LARC users to prevent STIs, par-
ticularly as adolescent LARC use increases. Our finding that
LARC users are less likely to use condoms in comparison with
oral contraceptive users suggests that it may be beneficial for
clinicians to specifically promote condoms for STI preven-
tion. Although this approach may be particularly important
within the context of LARC scale-up, it also may serve to in-
crease condom use with moderately effective contraceptive
methods by motivating adolescents to avoid STIs. Regardless
of the strategy or combination of strategies used, improving
dual protection among adolescents will be key to maximizing
both pregnancy and STI prevention goals.
