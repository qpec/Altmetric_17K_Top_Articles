Background-—Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a leading cause of death in the United States and often occurs without previous
cardiac symptoms. Lifetime risk for SCD and the influence of established risk factors on lifetime risks for SCD have not been
estimated previously.
Methods and Results-—We followed Framingham Heart Study participants who were free of cardiovascular disease before their
earliest examination. SCD was defined as death attributed to coronary heart disease within 1 hour of symptom onset without
another probable cause of death, as adjudicated by a panel of 3 physicians. Lifetime risk for SCD was estimated to 85 years of age
for men and women, with death attributed to other causes as the competing risk, and stratified by risk factor levels. We followed
2294 men and 2785 women for 160 396 person-years; 375 experienced SCD. At 45 years of age, lifetime risks were 10.9% (95%
CI, 9.4–12.5) for men and 2.8% (95% CI, 2.1–3.5) for women. Greater aggregate burden of established risk factors was associated
with a higher lifetime risk for SCD. Categorizing men and women solely by blood pressure levels resulted in a clear stratification of
lifetime risk curves.
Conclusions-—We present the first lifetime risk estimates for SCD. Greater aggregate risk factor burden, or blood pressure level
alone, is associated with higher lifetime risks for SCD. This high risk of premature death attributed to SCD (approximately 1 in 9
men and 1 in 30 women) should serve as a motivator of public health efforts in preventing and responding to SCD. (J Am Heart

S
udden cardiac death (SCD) is a leading cause of death in
the United States, with incidence estimated to be
between 180 000 and 450 000 per year.1SCD most com-
monly occurs in those with no previous overt symptoms of
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is an especially important
cause of premature deaths.2 Up to 25% of out-of-hospital
sudden cardiac arrests occur in individuals who were
asymptomatic before to the event.3 Most of those who
experience SCD have underlying coronary heart disease
(CHD), but other variables, such as environmental exposures
and gene expression, have been shown to be associated with
SCD events.3,4 A widely used SCD risk stratification method,
classifying based on ejection fraction, often misses patients
who ultimately experience SCD, but a better method that
accurately predicts patients who will experience SCD over a
specified time frame does not exist.2,5 Therefore, improved
understanding and prediction of those at risk for SCD is an
important step in reducing deaths attributed to SCD.
Lifetime risk estimates for several types of CVD and total
CVD have previously been reported.6–12 These studies have
shown that those with optimal risk factor profiles, including
simultaneous untreated optimal levels of blood pressure and
total cholesterol, and absence of current smoking or diabetes
mellitus, have a substantially lower overall lifetime risk for
CVD compared with those with a greater aggregate risk factor
burden. However, cumulative lifetime risk for SCD has not
previously been estimated in any cohort. Lifetime risk
estimation adjusts for competing risks of death, which
becomes increasingly important in longer-term risk estimation
given that the risk from other causes of death increases over
time. The importance of establishing risk models composed of
important, readily available clinical variables has recently been
highlighted.5 The present study used individual participant
data from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) original cohort
to estimate the remaining cumulative lifetime risk for SCD in
men and women at index ages 45, 55, 65, and 75 years of

and also stratify by aggregate risk factor burden at each index
age.
Methods
Participants
The Framingham Heart Study is a community-based prospec-
tive epidemiological study among 5209 men and women
enrolled between the ages of 28 and 62 years in Framingham,
Massachusetts.
Participants
have
had
medical
history
assessed, a physical examination, and laboratory tests every
2 years. The FHS’s protocol and study design have been
described
elsewhere.13
Protocols
and
procedures
were
approved by the institutional review board of Boston Medical
Center. Written informed consent was obtained from all
participants. For the present study, we assessed all partici-
pants who were free of CVD before their earliest examination
between 1948 and 2001 (exams 1–26) and who attended at
least 1 examination between the ages of 40 and 94 years.
Follow-up for vital status of the cohort has been essentially
complete throughout the duration of the study.
Participants in the FHS underwent standardized anthropo-
metric measurements for height and weight. Current smoking
was defined as self-report of active smoking within the last
year before the examination. Blood pressure was the average
of 2 separate readings taken by a physician at least 5 minutes
apart, as described previously.14 Blood was drawn in EDTA
plasma for all cholesterol measurements, as previously
described.15 Diabetes mellitus was defined as the use of
insulin or hypoglycemic agents or a casual blood glucose
≥11 mmol/L (≥200 mg/dL). We included 4 risk factors:
systolic/diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, current
smoking status, and diabetes mellitus diagnosis to stratify
participants according to the mutually exclusive aggregate
risk factor burden strata defined in Table 1. Past CVD history
was defined as having a nonfatal myocardial infarction,
nonfatal stroke, or a congestive heart failure diagnosis before
the examination used for each participant at the selected
index age.
Case Ascertainment
Our primary outcome of interest was SCD, defined, as
published previously, as a death attributed to CHD within
1 hour of symptom onset with no other probable cause of
death suggested from the medical record.16 The cause of
death was assessed by a review to determine whether
symptoms were present and the duration of the symptoms
before death. To determine the duration of symptoms, various
methods, including next-of-kin interviews, primary physician
records, and hospital records, were used. Any unwitnessed
deaths or those for which the time between symptom onset
and death was more than 1 hour were excluded from an SCD
categorization. All suspected sudden death events were
reviewed and adjudicated by a panel of 3 trained physicians
who applied established criteria for such events.16,17
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical
software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). We
classified each eligible participant exam record by age into
index ages of 45, 55, 65, and 75, where each index age
category included data obtained within 5 years of the index
age. If participants had multiple exams within a given index
age stratum, only the first record was included. In addition, all
participants were stratified by aggregate risk factor burden (as
described above) at each index age for which they attended
an examination, separately for men and women.
We used a modified form of Kaplan–Meier analysis, which
accounts for competing risks from causes other than SCD, to
avoid overestimating lifetime risk, as described in detail
previously.6,18 Briefly, the adjusted Kaplan–Meier analysis
counts deaths attributed to causes other than SCD as a
separate event, not as a censoring event as occurs in
unadjusted Kaplan–Meier analysis. The cumulative risk for

 SCD, adjusted for competing causes of death, was computed
for men and women at each index age through age 84 years
or to the oldest age with at least 100 weighted person-years
of follow-up (to assure robust estimates), as in previous
published analyses.6–12 A chi-squared test was used to test
for statistical differences of lifetime risks to 85 years of age.
We also examined the association of individual risk factors
with lifetime risk for SCD. Adjusted cumulative incidence
rates for SCD were computed for levels of aggregate risk
factor burden for each index age and sex. Significant secular
trends in risk factor burden and in rates of overall CVD and
CHD death over the last several decades have been notable,
with lower overall CVD death rates and generally lower
prevalence of elevated or adverse risk factors.3 Therefore, the
overall pattern of our results may be more important than the
absolute precision of the lifetime risk estimates for more
contemporary population samples.
In a sensitivity analysis of cumulative SCD risk for different
index ages, we excluded participants who had been diagnosed
with CVD between cohort inclusion and the index age.
Results
Participant characteristics at each index age are displayed in
Table 2, stratified by sex. The proportion of individuals who
had experienced a past CVD event ranged from 0.1% at index
age 45 years to 17% among men at index age 75 years. As
expected, mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels and the

 prevalence of diabetes mellitus were higher, and the preva-
lence of current smoking was lower, at older index ages. The
distribution of individuals by aggregate risk factor burden is
also presented in Table 2. At every index age, the majority
(65–89%) of men and women had 1 or more major risk
factors. In contrast, 0.3% to 3.1% of participants were in the
all optimal risk factor stratum.
The number of individuals, person-years of follow-up, total
deaths, and total SCDs are shown in Table 3, stratified by sex
and index age. For example, there were 1575 men at index
age 45 years who were followed for 48 096 person-years.
During this period, 1370 deaths occurred, of which 178 were
attributed to SCD.
Overall lifetime risk estimates for SCD for the selected index
ages are displayed in Table 4. Men had significantly higher
lifetime risk estimates than women across all index ages. For
example, men at index age 45 have a remaining lifetime risk of
SCD of 10.9% (95% CI, 9.4–12.5), which is statistically different
(v2=82.64; P<0.001) from women at the same age, who have a
2.8% (95% CI, 2.1–3.5) remaining lifetime risk.
Adjusted cumulative risk curves for SCD by sex and
aggregate risk factor strata at index age 45 years are
displayed in Figure 1. Data for index ages 55, 65, and
75 years are displayed in Figures 2 through 4, respectively.
Significant differences in lifetime risk (P<0.05) between those
with all optimal risk factor burden compared to those with at
least 2 major risk factors are noted in the figure captions.
Overall, participants with 1 or at least 2 major risk factor
strata had higher lifetime risk estimates for SCD compared to
those with all optimal risk factor levels at all selected index
ages; however, those differences were not significant for men
or women at index ages 65 and 75. For instance, women at
index age 55 had an adjusted cumulative lifetime risk of SCD

 before age 70 years. Men with at least 1 elevated risk factor
had an adjusted lifetime risk score of more than 7%. Women
have significantly lower cumulative lifetime risk for SCD than
men with an adjusted lifetime risk of no more than 6% for any
risk burden stratum.
We also examined lifetime risk for SCD by individual risk
factor levels at the selected index ages. Blood pressure levels
stratified lifetime risk for SCD better than any other single risk
factor. Adjusted cumulative risks for SCD by blood pressure
strata for index ages 45, 55, 65, and 75 years are shown in
Figures 5 through 8, respectively. Significant differences in
lifetime risk are between those in the lowest blood pressure
category and the highest blood pressure category at baseline
and are noted in the figure captions. For men at all index ages
and women of all but index age 45, those in the highest 2
blood pressure categories also had the highest lifetime risk
for SCD. For example, men at index age 45 with lowest
baseline blood pressure had significantly lower lifetime risk
(P<0.001) compared to those in any of the higher baseline
blood pressure categories. Men at index age 45 in the lowest
blood pressure category (SBP <120 mm Hg and diastolic
blood pressure [DBP] <80 mm Hg) have an adjusted cumu-
lative lifetime risk (through 85 years) for SCD of 5.5%, those
with SBP between 120 and 139 mm Hg or DBP 80 to
89 mm Hg have a 11.9% lifetime risk, and those with SBP
between 140 and 159 mm Hg or DBP 90 to 99 mm Hg have
a 12.8% lifetime risk, and those in the highest category (SBP
≥160 mm Hg, DBP ≥100 mm Hg, or on antihypertensive
medication) have a 16.3% lifetime risk of SCD. Women had a
significantly lower cumulative lifetime risk than men at all
index ages, regardless of SBP/DBP, but blood pressure levels
stratified their lifetime risk for SCD as well.
We performed a sensitivity analysis excluding those with
manifest clinical CVD at each index age (data not shown).
Differences from the primary analyses were negligible for
each index age and sex, indicating that including those with
past CVD history did not significantly alter our overall results.
Discussion
We describe the first estimates of lifetime risks for SCD. Total
remaining lifetime risk estimates for men were at least twice
that of women for all index ages (45, 55, 65, and 75 years). Men
had a similar lifetime risk at index ages 45, 55, and 65, with
estimates ranging between 10.1% and 11.2%. Women also had
a similar remaining lifetime risk of SCD for all index ages,
between 2.4% and 3.4%. The majority of SCD events occurred
before age 70 years, indicating a substantial burden of sudden
and premature mortality that is potentially preventable.
Overall, those in the higher aggregate risk burden strata (at
least 1 elevated, 1 major, or at least 2 major) had higher

 lifetime risks than those in the lower risk burden strata.
However, men with index age 55 in the at least 1 not optimal
risk burden stratum had a higher cumulative lifetime risk than
other strata past 70 years of age. This could indicate that a
significant risk factor related to SCD was not included in our
risk burden categories. It could also indicate that competing
risk of death attributed to causes other than SCD is higher for
those with greater aggregate burden of risk factors.
Stratifying individuals by blood pressure level alone
resulted in notable separation of lifetime risk curves, with
those in the highest blood pressure stratum always having the
highest total lifetime risk and those in the lowest blood
pressure stratum always having the lowest cumulative lifetime
risk, regardless of sex or index age. Examining blood pressure
level alone thus may be an important discriminator of those at
highest risk for SCD in their lifetime, which could aid clinicians
in targeting prevention efforts. Likewise, risks for SCD in men
with 2 or more major risk factors were notably elevated.
Implications
SCD has a high prevalence, both in the United States and
globally, with incidence in the United States alone estimated
to be between 180 000 and 450 000 depending on case
ascertainment and definition of SCD.1 Stecker et al. recently
estimated that, in the United States, the years of potential life
lost to SCD were 2.0 million for men and 1.3 million for
women, which is greater than for any individual cancer and
most other leading causes of death. Thus, whereas we
observed that women have a significantly lower incidence,
SCD still represents a major cause of life-years lost for both
men and women.19
Currently, effective methods for early prediction of SCD do
not exist. Our results suggest that using the easily ascertained
risk factors of age, sex, SBP/DBP and total cholesterol levels,
current smoking status, and diabetes mellitus diagnosis to
categorize people into risk burden groups may be useful in
stratifying lifetime risk for SCD. Furthermore, using only blood
pressure levels was effective in categorizing FHS participants
for most age/sex strata into distinct cumulative risk trajec-
tories.
Given that many SCD events occur in individuals without
past symptoms and occur prematurely, it is imperative for
clinicians to consider factors that may increase risk for SCD.
Our data suggest that a continued clinical and public health
focus on the prevention of the development of risk factors (ie,
primordial prevention) before middle age may be the best
strategy to reduce the lifetime risk and overall burden of SCD.
Once risk factors develop, lifetime risks for SCD are elevated,
and more intensive efforts, including medications that have
been shown to reduce CHD death, such as statins,20,21 may
be needed in individuals at significant risk. Regarding the

 importance of blood pressure as an indicator of lifetime risk
for SCD, our data also suggest the hypothesis that blood
pressure reduction in patients with hypertension might reduce
long-term SCD risk. This hypothesis is consistent with findings
from clinical trials, in which blood pressure reduction was
associated with substantial reduction in SCD risk, particularly
among individuals with hypertension and manifest electrocar-
diographic left ventricular hypertrophy.22
Strengths and Limitations
Our study’s strengths include the relatively large sample size
and long follow-up time, and the careful collection of
evidence for adjudication of SCD events. Nonetheless,
diagnosis of SCD as the underlying cause of death remains
difficult. Our study also has several limitations. The FHS
cohort is exclusively Caucasian, so our results may not be
generalizable to other race/ethnic groups in whom SCD may
be more or less common as a cause of death. Likewise, the
lifetime risk of SCD in other race/ethnic group is likely to be
a function of the burden of established risk factors and the
burden of competing causes of death in those groups.
Further study in other samples is encouraged. Because of the
low prevalence of the all optimal aggregate risk factor burden
stratum, this group had limited follow-up time in some
instances, and had large confidence intervals around the
estimates, resulting in unreliable conclusions for the all
optimal risk burden. When we stratified by index age, sex,
and risk factor stratum, some of the resulting sample sizes
also became small. As previously discussed, the overall
patterns found in our results between groups may be more
important than the exact estimates provided, because of
changes in CVD death rates and risk factor prevalence over
time. Our prior data examining secular trends in lifetime risks
suggest that these data are still relevant to understanding the
natural history for individuals in risk factor strata.6 Our
analysis provides lifetime risk estimates by risk burden, age,
and sex strata. True individual lifetime risk of SCD may vary
from the estimates that our assessment provides, which is a
limitation for all population-based models. However, we
believe that these estimates may be useful for communicat-
ing risks of SCD with individuals who fit into a particular risk
stratum, which may encourage adherence to recommended
therapeutic lifestyle changes.
These first estimates of remaining lifetime risk for SCD in
men and women in a well-characterized, longitudinally
followed cohort provide important insights into potential
prevention strategies for decreasing the ongoing substantial
burden of SCD in the population.
