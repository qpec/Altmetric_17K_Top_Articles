Background
Tobacco use is the largest single preventable cause of death and disease worldwide. Standardised tobacco packaging is an intervention
intended to reduce the promotional appeal of packs and can be defined as packaging with a uniform colour (and in some cases shape
and size) with no logos or branding, apart from health warnings and other government-mandated information, and the brand name
in a prescribed uniform font, colour and size. Australia was the first country to implement standardised tobacco packaging between
October and December 2012, France implemented standardised tobacco packaging on 1 January 2017 and several other countries are
implementing, or intending to implement, standardised tobacco packaging.
Objectives
To assess the effect of standardised tobacco packaging on tobacco use uptake, cessation and reduction.
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and six other databases from 1980 to January 2016. We checked bibliographies and
contacted study authors to identify additional peer-reviewed studies.
Selection criteria
Primary outcomes included changes in tobacco use prevalence incorporating tobacco use uptake, cessation, consumption and relapse
prevention. Secondary outcomes covered intermediate outcomes that can be measured and are relevant to tobacco use uptake, cessa-
tion or reduction. We considered multiple study designs: randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental and experimental studies,
observational cross-sectional and cohort studies. The review focused on all populations and people of any age; to be included, studies
had to be published in peer-reviewed journals. We examined studies that assessed the impact of changes in tobacco packaging such as
colour, design, size and type of health warnings on the packs in relation to branded packaging. In experiments, the control condition
was branded tobacco packaging but could include variations of standardised packaging.

 Data collection and analysis
Screening and data extraction followed standard Cochrane methods. We used different ’Risk of bias’ domains for different study types.
We have summarised findings narratively.
Main results
Fifty-one studies met our inclusion criteria, involving approximately 800,000 participants. The studies included were diverse, including
observational studies, between- and within-participant experimental studies, cohort and cross-sectional studies, and time-series analyses.
Few studies assessed behavioural outcomes in youth and non-smokers. Five studies assessed the primary outcomes: one observational
study assessed smoking prevalence among 700,000 participants until one year after standardised packaging in Australia; four studies
assessed consumption in 9394 participants, including a series of Australian national cross-sectional surveys of 8811 current smokers,
in addition to three smaller studies. No studies assessed uptake, cessation, or relapse prevention. Two studies assessed quit attempts.
Twenty studies examined other behavioural outcomes and 45 studies examined non-behavioural outcomes (e.g. appeal, perceptions
of harm). In line with the challenges inherent in evaluating standardised tobacco packaging, a number of methodological imitations
were apparent in the included studies and overall we judged most studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain.
The one included study assessing the impact of standardised tobacco packaging on smoking prevalence in Australia found a 3.7%
reduction in odds when comparing before to after the packaging change, or a 0.5 percentage point drop in smoking prevalence, when
adjusting for confounders. Confidence in this finding is limited, due to the nature of the evidence available, and is therefore rated low by
GRADE standards. Findings were mixed amongst the four studies assessing consumption, with some studies finding no difference and
some studies finding evidence of a decrease; certainty in this outcome was rated very low by GRADE standards due to the limitations
in study design. One national study of Australian adult smoker cohorts (5441 participants) found that quit attempts increased from
20.2% prior to the introduction of standardised packaging to 26.6% one year post-implementation. A second study of calls to quitlines
provides indirect support for this finding, with a 78% increase observed in the number of calls after the implementation of standardised
packaging. Here again, certainty is low. Studies of other behavioural outcomes found evidence of increased avoidance behaviours when
using standardised packs, reduced demand for standardised packs and reduced craving. Evidence from studies measuring eye-tracking
showed increased visual attention to health warnings on standardised compared to branded packs. Corroborative evidence for the
latter finding came from studies assessing non-behavioural outcomes, which in general found greater warning salience when viewing
standardised, than branded packs. There was mixed evidence for quitting cognitions, whereas findings with youth generally pointed
towards standardised packs being less likely to motivate smoking initiation than branded packs. We found the most consistent evidence
for appeal, with standardised packs rating lower than branded packs. Tobacco in standardised packs was also generally perceived as
worse-tasting and lower quality than tobacco in branded packs. Standardised packaging also appeared to reduce misperceptions that
some cigarettes are less harmful than others, but only when dark colours were used for the uniform colour of the pack.
Authors’ conclusions
The available evidence suggests that standardised packaging may reduce smoking prevalence. Only one country had implemented
standardised packaging at the time of this review, so evidence comes from one large observational study that provides evidence for this
effect. A reduction in smoking behaviour is supported by routinely collected data by the Australian government. Data on the effects
of standardised packaging on non-behavioural outcomes (e.g. appeal) are clearer and provide plausible mechanisms of effect consistent
with the observed decline in prevalence. As standardised packaging is implemented in different countries, research programmes should
be initiated to capture long term effects on tobacco use prevalence, behaviour, and uptake. We did not find any evidence suggesting
standardised packaging may increase tobacco use.

Can the use of standardised packaging for tobacco products reduce the use of tobacco?
Background
Tobacco use kills more people worldwide than any other preventable cause of death. The best way to reduce tobacco use is by stopping
people from starting to use tobacco and encouraging and helping existing users to stop. This can be done by introducing policies that
can reach a wide number of people in a country, together with offering individual treatment and support to individuals who are already
using tobacco to help them to stop. Many countries have introduced bans on tobacco advertising but have not controlled the look of the
tobacco pack itself. Tobacco packs can be colourful and attractive, with exciting new shapes and sizes. Standardised tobacco packaging
2
T

 is a government policy which removes these bright designs by, for example, only allowing tobacco packs to be in one colour, shape or
size. Standardised packaging generally involves the use of the same uniform colour on all tobacco packs, with no brand imagery, and
the brand name written in a specified font, colour and size. Health warnings and other information that governments wish to put on
the packs can remain. Australia was the first country to introduce standardised tobacco packaging by December 2012. France was the
second by January 2017. Several other countries are introducing standardised packaging or planning to do so. We examined whether
standardised packaging reduces tobacco use.
Study characteristics
We searched nine databases for articles evaluating standardised packaging that had been already reviewed by academics and published
before January 2016. We also checked references in those papers to other studies and contacted the authors where necessary.
Key results
We found 51 studies involving approximately 800,000 participants. These studies varied considerably. Some studies focused on the
effect of standardised packaging in Australia, and included looking at overall smoking levels, whether smokers altered their behaviour
such as by cutting down the number of cigarettes they smoked, and whether smokers were making more quit attempts. We also included
experiments in which people used or viewed standardised tobacco packs and examined their responses, compared to when they were
viewing branded packs. We also included studies that assessed people’s eye movements when they looked at different packs and how
willing people were to buy, and how much they were willing to pay for, standardised compared to branded packs.
Only five studies looked at our key outcomes. One study in Australia looked at data from 700,000 people before and after standardised
packaging was introduced. This study found that there was a half a percentage point drop in the proportion of people who used tobacco
after the introduction of standardised packaging, compared to before, when adjusting for other factors which could affect this. Four
other studies looked at whether current smokers changed the number of cigarettes they smoked. Two studies from Australia looked at
this, one using surveys which included 8811 current smokers, and found no change in the number of cigarettes smoked. The three
smaller studies found mixed results. Two further studies looked at quit attempts and observed increases in these in Australia after
standardised packaging was introduced. The remainder of the studies looked at other outcomes, and the most consistent finding was
that standardised packaging reduced how appealing people found the packs compared with branded packs. No studies reported the
number of people who quit using tobacco, the number of people who started using tobacco, or the number of people who returned to
using tobacco after quitting.
Quality of the evidence
Certainty in these findings is limited for several reasons, including the difficulties involved in studying national policies like standard-
ised packaging. However, findings suggesting standardised packaging may decrease tobacco use are supported by routine data from
the Australian government and studies looking at other outcomes. For example, in our included studies people consistently found
standardised packs less appealing than branded packs. We did not find any evidence suggesting standardised packaging may increase
tobacco use.

 of the effect
Very low quality: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different
from the estimate of effect
1Based on observational evidence only. Though enhanced pictorial health warnings were implemented at the same time as
standardised packaging, making it difficult to separate the effects, we have not downgraded further for two reasons: 1) the
low GRADE already reflects the challenges in inferring causality from observational data; and 2) data on non-behavioural
outcomes provides plausible mechanisms of effect consistent with the observed decline in prevalence.
2Sample size estimated over the period of the study.
3No downgrade for risk of bias: the studies did not show meaningful change in tobacco use and so confounding is unlikely to
have influenced the result.
4Downgraded one level for indirectness: large cross-sectional survey study only included smokers at each survey wave so
changes in consumption would exclude people smoking at baseline who subsequently quit.

B A C K G R O U N D
Tobacco use is the largest single preventable cause of disease and
premature death worldwide, being a key causal factor in heart
disease, stroke, chronic lung disease and cancers, among many
other diseases. Increasing the number of tobacco users who stop
is therefore a critically important health goal.
A variety of interventions have been shown to reduce adult to-
bacco use, including prohibitions on tobacco promotion (World
Bank 1999; World Health Organization 2015). Tobacco promo-
tion has been defined as direct advertising (broadcast and print me-
dia, billboards/outdoor and point of sale) and indirect advertising
in the form of cigarette-branded merchandise, free tobacco prod-
ucts and sponsorship (Henriksen 2012). Tobacco promotion has
been demonstrated to increase tobacco consumption, discourage
quitting and encourage relapse (National Cancer Institute 2008).
Several countries have introduced comprehensive tobacco adver-
tising and marketing bans (World Health Organization 2015).
One channel of promotion remains, however, in all countries ex-
cept Australia and very recently France. This is marketing through
the tobacco pack itself. There is evidence that the tobacco industry
has adapted to closure of other promotional channels by increasing
their focus on tobacco packaging through design aspects, price-
marketing and other innovations to promote tobacco use and dis-
courage cessation (Freeman 2008; Wakefield 2002). Australia was
the first country to introduce standardised (plain) packaging for
all tobacco products doing so by December 2012. France recently
(January 2017) implemented standardised packaging for cigarettes
and roll-your-own tobacco, and the UK will fully implement stan-
dardised packaging by May 2017. Hungary, Norway, Ireland and
New Zealand are in the process of adopting or implementing stan-
dardised packaging and several other countries are in the process
of developing legislation to introduce this packaging change.
This review examines whether the introduction of standardised
tobacco packaging can prevent tobacco uptake in children and
young people and increase tobacco cessation and reduce tobacco
consumption in tobacco users.
Description of the intervention
Standardised packaging is an intervention intended to reduce the
promotional appeal of the pack. The exact description of stan-
dardised packaging can vary, but the World Health Organization’s
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) Article 13
guidelines (World Health Organization 2008) have suggested a
uniform colour and “nothing other than a brand name, a product
name and/or manufacturer’s name, contact details and the quantity
of product in the packaging, without any logos or other features apart
from health warnings, tax stamps and other government-mandated
information or markings;prescribed font style and size; and standard-
ized shape, size and materials. There should be no advertising or pro-
motion inside or attached to the package or on individual cigarettes or
other tobacco products” (WHO FCTC Article 13 guidelines). The
only distinguishing feature of packs would then be the brand and
product variant names, and as stated above these would be in a
uniform style, colour and position (Freeman 2008).
How the intervention might work
6
T

 Standardised packaging could work by removing imagery/livery
on the tobacco packs which is misleading, attractive or acting as
a cue to tobacco use. Standardised packaging could also serve to
increase the salience of health warnings. In all these cases standard-
ised packing could alter knowledge, attitudes and beliefs towards
tobacco use, which could reduce tobacco uptake in children and
young people and lead to reduction or cessation or both of tobacco
use in current tobacco users.
Why it is important to do this review
The introduction of standardised packaging was recommended
within the FCTC Article 11 and Article 13 guidelines (World
Health Organization 2008), based on evidence around tobacco
promotion in general and studies which have examined the im-
pact of changes in packaging on knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and
behaviour. A systematic review of the evidence of the literature
(available up until August 2011) was published by some of the
co-authors of this review (Stead 2013). Standardised packaging
was introduced across Australia by December 2012 and France by
January 2017, and several other countries are now in the process
of implementing standardised packaging, have indicated that they
are interested in introducing a similar policy or are in the process
of introducing a similar policy. The evidence base has increased
markedly since the publication of the FCTC guidelines and the
systematic review, and is expanding further as more studies of the
impact of Australia’s introduction of standardised packaging be-
come available.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We consider three types of study design in this review, restricted to
peer-reviewed published studies. These include randomised con-
trolled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies (quasi-RCTs),
observational cross-sectional and cohort studies, and physiological
studies (such as eye-tracking and neuroimaging). Some of these
study designs (e.g. eye-tracking) were included to provide infor-
mation on secondary outcomes, to provide insight into the poten-
tial mechanisms of standardised packaging.
Types of participants
This review focuses on people of any age where a study directly
measures smoking uptake, cessation, or reduction behaviour or
attitudes/knowledge/beliefs directly linked to uptake, quitting or
reduction. We include all populations in this review, regardless of
nationality, gender, socioeconomic status and ethnic group. For
measures of cessation or reduction, we include all tobacco users,
regardless of frequency/dependence/consumption and also recent
ex-tobacco users (quit for one year or less).
Types of interventions
We examine any studies that assess the impact of changes in to-
bacco packaging, such as on colour, design, and size and type of
health warnings on the packs, in relation to branded packaging.
The control is likely to be branded tobacco packaging but can also
include variations of standardised packaging.
For this review, ‘tobacco products’ include cigarettes, loose to-
bacco for hand-rolled cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, pipe tobacco,
kreteks, bidis (beedis), and also smokeless tobacco, covering snuff
and chewing tobacco. ‘Packaging’ refers to the container (packet,
pouch, tin) in which tobacco products are stored, but excludes the
paper or leaves or other means of wrapping loose tobacco.
Types of outcome measures
To be included in the review, studies had to measure at least one
of our primary or secondary outcomes, which are listed below.
Primary outcomes
The primary outcome is changes in tobacco use prevalence incor-
porating tobacco use uptake, tobacco use cessation, reduction in
consumption and relapse prevention.
Prevalence measures include the number of people classified as
current smokers (defined differently in different studies). We in-
tended to measure cessation as people who were tobacco users at
baseline who were quit at follow-up; no studies reported on this
outcome, nor did any report on relapse prevention, defined as go-
ing back to smoking after a period of abstinence. We measured
consumption according to the methods reported in individual pa-
pers, most commonly cigarettes per day but also including packs
per day. We planned to evaluate the impact on uptake through
the proportion of children and young people reporting current
tobacco use, but again no papers reported on this outcome. It
should be noted that the primary outcomes considered here are
not typically the primary objectives of country regulations, which
instead focus on our secondary outcomes below.
Secondary outcomes
We anticipated very few studies assessing the impacts on primary
outcomes for inclusion in the first version of this review. Our list of

 secondary outcomes therefore aims to cover potential intermedi-
ate outcomes that can be measured and are relevant to tobacco use
uptake, cessation or reduction. These include two broad groups of
outcome, which are described below. The potential relationships
between these outcomes is illustrated in Figure 1, which is based
on a model developed by the World Health Organization’s Inter-
national Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC 2008).

Mediation model for package labelling policies (adapted from IARC 2008)
Other behavioural outcomes:
1. quit attempts;
2. forgoing cigarettes/stubbing out cigarettes;
3. covering the pack (avoidance/display);
4. eye-tracking;
5. actual purchase or selection of tobacco that participants
believed that they would receive.
Non-behavioural outcomes: attitudes, perceptions and beliefs
about tobacco products and their use, including:
1. motivation and plans to quit (including thinking about
quitting);
2. intentions/susceptibility to use tobacco (among young
people);
3. craving;
4. packaging appeal (including measures of attractiveness,
taste, product quality, satisfaction, enjoyment and value);
5. recall, salience and/or believability of health warnings;
6. perceptions of harm.
We measured these outcomes according to the methods used in
individual papers. We assessed outcomes over any measured time
periods, given that standardised packaging for tobacco packs has
only recently been introduced.
Search methods for identification of studies
We compiled the search strategy by combining tobacco-related
terms with packaging-related terms. We adapted the terms used
8
T

 in the search in accordance with each database’s search terminol-
ogy. The MEDLINE search strategy is contained in Appendix
1. We included studies regardless of language. We only included
published, peer-reviewed articles (see Discussion). Our searches
started from 1980, as the concept of standardised packaging was
introduced in 1986 and the first study published in 1987.
Electronic searches
The search strategy included searches for studies in the academic
literature from generic and topic-specific electronic databases from
the fields of health and addiction, public policy, business and mar-
keting, social sciences and psychology.The most recent search was
conducted in January 2016. Databases and their respective search
dates are listed below:
• MEDLINE (via OVID) 1980 to Jan week 1 2016
• MEDLINE In Process & Other (via OVID) 14 Jan 2016
• Embase (via OVID) 1980 to week 2 2016
• PsycINFO (via OVID) 1980 to Jan week 2 2016
• ASSIA , ABI Inform, EconLit, IBSS, Sociological Abstracts
(via Proquest) 1980 to update 20160114
• SSCI (via Web of Science) 1980 to 15 January 2016
Searching other resources
Handsearching
We checked the bibliographies from included studies for further
studies and citation trails, which check which papers have cited an
included study. We followed citation trails using Google Scholar
and the Web of Knowledge cited reference search.
Personal contact/’grey’ literature
We also contacted key individuals and organisations, identified
through the search process above, to identify further publications
not retrieved in the searches.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
To be included in the review, the studies had to be:
• from or after 1980 (the concept of plain packaging was
introduced in 1986 and the first study published in 1987);
• about human populations;
• about tobacco;
• about packaging;
• primary research published in a peer-reviewed journal.
There were three phases of study selection. In the first phase, one
review author sifted through the citations retrieved and excluded
obviously irrelevant material (e.g. studies that are not about to-
bacco and packaging, and do not include human participants).
In the second stage of study selection, two review authors inde-
pendently screened the titles and abstracts of the studies against
the inclusion criteria to identify potentially relevant studies. We
obtained potentially relevant studies identified at this stage in full
text. A minimum of two review authors (content specialist and
methodologist) then independently screened the full-text studies
for relevance, and eliminated any that did not meet the inclusion
criteria. We included studies remaining after the second screening
stage in the review, and linked together reports or articles for the
same studies. We resolved any discrepancies in studies selected for
inclusion by discussion among the review team.
Data extraction and management
We developed a data extraction form and piloted and amended it
as necessary. At least two review authors independently extracted
data for each included study, resolving any disagreements, errors
or inconsistencies by discussion, or by recourse to a third review
author. One review author entered the data into Review Manager 5
(RevMan 2014), with anotherreviewauthorcheckingthe accuracy
of the data entry.
We kept records of amendments and corrections to the data ex-
traction forms, and noted details of discussions on inconsistencies.
Data extracted
• Title/unique identifier;
• Lead author;
• Date of report/publication;
• Version number of data extraction form;
• ID of data extractor;
• ID of study;
• Aims, objectives;
• Theoretical basis;
• Study design (triggering appropriate sub-fields, e.g. if
randomised controlled trial);
• Setting;
• Participant details;
• Sample size, attrition and follow-up;
• Interventions;
• Outcomes measured and when;
• Results;
• Assessment of risks of bias;
• Source of funding;
• Potential conflicts of interest, declared or not.
We noted the source of each piece of data extracted and made
space for comments on the data extraction form throughout.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We used different ’Risk of bias’ domains for different study types.
Where available and relevant, we used the most recent Cochrane
methodology. For randomised controlled trials, we assessed the
risk of selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation
9
T

 concealment), detection bias (blinding of outcome measurement),
and attrition bias. Depending on study type, we also assessed the
risk of selective reporting (reporting bias), sampling method, mea-
surement of independent variables, measurement of dependent
variables, control for confounding, and statistical methods, where
relevant. These additional non-standard domains were adopted
from a previous review of standardised packaging conducted by
some membersof the authorteam(Moodie 2012c). Foreach study,
at least two review authors independently assessed risks of bias,
with disagreements resolved by discussion or referral to a third re-
view author. To ensure transparency in our judgements, we report
relevant study quotes and comment on reasons for our judgements
in each domain (see Characteristics of included studies).
As well as considering the presence of possible bias, we also con-
sidered possible direction of bias. This particularly informed our
quality judgements in the ’Summary of findings’ table (see foot-
notes in ’Summary of findings’ table). Our ’Risk of bias’ judge-
ments for individual studies on the domains listed above focus on
internal validity, in line with standard Cochrane methods. How-
ever, also as in standard Cochrane methods, we use the GRADE
approach to assess the certainty of evidence for our primary out-
comes and for change in quit attempts (presented in the ’Sum-
mary of findings’ table). As well as assessing internal validity, this
approach also judges external validity. In particular, the GRADE
approach entails assessments of risk of bias, inconsistency, impre-
cision, indirectness, and publication bias.
Measures of treatment effect
Due to limitations in the data currently available, we describe all
data narratively using the methods from original study reports.
Had sufficient data been available (and should sufficient data be-
come available in subsequent versions of this review), we would
have employed the following measures:
• Where dichotomous data were presented in study reports,
we would summarise trial outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) with
95% confidence intervals (CIs), where appropriate.
• At the population level, we would use changes in prevalence
of tobacco use over time as an outcome measure. At the
individual level, we would extract tobacco use cessation rates
from the reports at all available follow-up points. Where possible,
we would use a dichotomous approach for change in cigarette
consumption, where changes are categorised as reduction by
50% or more, or no change/reduction of less than 50%.
• We would analyse continuous data by comparing the
difference between the mean change from baseline to follow-up
point in the intervention and control groups, where appropriate.
Dealing with missing data
We contacted investigators in order to verify key study characteris-
tics and to obtain missing numerical outcome data where needed.
Had we synthesised the data numerically, and had missing data
been thought to introduce serious bias, we had planned to explore
the impact of including such studies in the overall assessment of
results by a sensitivity analysis.
We planned to use a conservative approach for missing data for
the primary tobacco use outcomes, considering missing data to be
for continuing tobacco users for cessation outcomes and missing
data to be no reduction for reduction outcomes, but this was not
relevant for the data in the current set of included studies.
Data synthesis
Due to considerable heterogeneity in terms of study design, con-
text, participants, and other study characteristics, it was not ap-
propriate to combine study findings statistically in a meta-analy-
sis We synthesised our results by outcome and summarise them
narratively (and in tabular form in some instances).
If we do conduct meta-analyses of primary outcomes in future
iterations of this review, we will pool risk ratios using a Mantel-
Haenszel fixed-effect model ((number of events in intervention
condition/intervention denominator) / (number of events in con-
trol condition/control denominator)) with a 95% CI. Where the
event is defined as smoking cessation, an RR greater than one
would indicate that more people successfully quit in the treatment
group than in the control group.
We have produced a ’Summary of findings’ table for all primary
outcomes and for change in quit attempts.

Results of the search
We identified 9085 records in database searches and 20 through
handsearching. After duplicates were removed, this left 8383 stud-
ies (see Figure 2). After the first screening round (removing clearly
irrelevant studies), this left 1011 titles and abstracts which were
screened by two review authors. We assessed 311 full-text articles
for eligibility.

 Included studies
We include 57 articles (54 from our search, 3 further identified
relating to included studies), representing 51 studies. Overall, the
included studies represent approximately 800,000 participants (an
exact number is not possible, given that some studies do not report
the total number of participants). We briefly summarise studies by
outcome below; full details for each included study can be found
in Characteristics of included studies tables. We include one ran-
domised controlled trial and 19 observational studies (including
cohort studies and cross-sectional surveys). The remainder of the
included studies were experimental and employed between- and/
or within- subjects designs; four of these used eye tracking.
Primary outcomes: changes in tobacco use
We found five published studies which examined changes in to-
bacco use. Three were from Australia, assessing the impact of stan-
dardised packaging legislation implemented in 2012 (Diethelm
2015; Miller 2015; Scollo 2015). Two were experimental studies
fromthe UK (Maynard2015; Moodie 2013). One studyexamined
changes in prevalence (Diethelm 2015) and four studies examined
changes in tobacco consumption among smokers (Maynard 2015;
Miller 2015; Moodie 2013; Scollo 2015). No studies examined
changes in relapse and tobacco uptake.
Changes in tobacco use prevalence
Diethelm 2015 assessed the effect of standardised packaging on
smokingprevalence among700,000adults(aged18+)inAustralia,
with the aim of investigating the findings of a tobacco industry-
funded paper which was not published in the peer-reviewed liter-
ature (Kaul 2014). Kaul 2014 concluded that standardised pack-
aging had no effect on reducing smoking prevalence. The study
used serial cross-country weekly surveys with a random sampling
design and were nationally representative of Australia. For the pe-
riod from January 2001 to December 2013 (one year after manda-
tory full implementation of standardised packaging), prevalence
figures were extracted and computed from data presented within
Kaul and Wolff’s working paper, adjusted for the following poli-
cies introduced over the 13-year period: graphic health warnings
(but not the enhancement of health warnings introduced along-
side standardised packaging in 2012), smoke-free policies, and tax
increases on tobacco products. A separate unpublished report from
the Australian Government (Chipty 2016) also uses the same data
as Diethelm 2015 and Kaul 2014. Given that they rely on the
same data set, we have incorporated findings from Chipty 2016
and Kaul 2014 in our analysis of Diethelm 2015.
Changes in tobacco consumption
Four studies assessed changes in self-reported tobacco consump-
tion (total of 9394 participants). Two studies were from Australia
and assessed changes in consumption after standardised packag-
ing was implemented in 2012 (Miller 2015; Scollo 2015): Scollo
2015 assessed changes in cigarette consumption among current
factory-made or roll-your-own cigarette smokers using a continu-
ous cross-sectional national survey (The National Plain Packaging
Tracking Survey) from April 2012 to March 2014; Miller 2015
assessed retrospective reports of consumption changes in cigar and
cigarillo smokers in a March 2014 cross-sectional survey.
Two experimental studies were from the UK (Maynard 2015;
Moodie 2013); Maynard 2015 deployed a randomised controlled
trial comparing effects of branded and standardised packaging on
smoking behaviour among young adult daily smokers (men and
women) when using these packs over a 24-hour period, includ-
ing volume of smoke inhaled using hand-held smoking topogra-
phy machines; Moodie 2013 used a non-randomised controlled
study, and assessed changes in smoking behaviour of young adult
female smokers who used standardised packs for one week and
their branded packs for one week in a counterbalanced design.
Secondary outcomes
Other behavioural outcomes
We found21studies(representingover27,000participants)which
examined other behavioural changes. Nine were observational
studies from Australia assessing the impact of standardised pack-
aging legislation implemented in 2012 (Durkin 2015; Miller
2015; Nicholson2015; Wakefield2015; White 2015a; Yong2015;
Young 2014; Zacher 2014; Zacher 2015); 12 were experimen-
tal studies: nine from the UK (Hammond 2013; Hogarth 2015;
Munafò 2011; Maynard 2013; Maynard 2014; Maynard 2015;
Moodie 2011; Moodie 2013; Shankleman 2015), two from the
USA (Hammond 2011; Rousu 2013) and one from Brazil (White
2012).
Of the observational studies, two used pre-post observational
methods in café strips before, during and after standardised pack-
aging implementation (Zacher 2014; Zacher 2015). Nicholson
2015 used a cross-sectional national survey of Aboriginal and Tor-
res Strait Islander smokers carried out pre- and post-standard-
ised packaging implementation. Wakefield 2015 used a continu-
ous cross-sectional national survey (The National Plain Packag-
ing Tracking Survey) from April 2012 to March 2014 (from be-
fore to 15 months after standardised packaging implementation).
Yong 2015 used adult cohort surveys (International Tobacco Con-
trol Policy Evaluation Project) to assess the impact of standardised
12

 packaging (1525 participants). Durkin 2015 used a series of four
adult smoker cohorts, also using the The National Plain Packag-
ing Tracking Survey. Young 2014 used an interrupted time series
design of routine data before and after standardised packaging.
Miller 2015 assessed retrospective reports in cigar and cigarillo
smokers in a March 2014 cross-sectional survey. White 2015a ex-
amined two cross-sectional school-based surveys before and after
standardised packaging to assess changes.
Of the experimental studies, nine were based in the UK. Maynard
2015 deployed a randomised controlled trial comparing branded
and standardised packaging on smoking behaviour among young
adult daily smokers (men and women) when using these packs
over a 24-hour period; Moodie 2011 used a non-randomised con-
trolled study, and assessed changes in smoking behaviour of young
adult smokers who used standardised packs for two weeks and
branded packs for two weeks in a counterbalanced design; simi-
larly Moodie 2013 used a non-randomised controlled study, and
assessed changes in smoking behaviour of young adult female
smokers who used standardised packs for one week and branded
packs for one week in a counterbalanced design. Four UK ex-
perimental studies measured eye fixations for different pack de-
signs (Maynard 2013; Maynard 2014; Munafò 2011; Shankleman
2015). Hogarth 2015 used a nominal Pavlovian to instrumental
transfer (PIT) procedure to assess tobacco-seeking with different
pack designs. In Hammond 2013 participants were asked to select
a pack which they would be sent (although they were subsequently
advised this would not happen). A further two experimental stud-
ies were based in the USA: Hammond 2011 (similar pack selec-
tion task to Hammond 2013), and Rousu 2013 conducted an ex-
perimental auction to purchase cigarettes in USA grocery stores
with adult smokers face-to-face. A final experimental study was
conducted in Brazil (White 2012), with a similar pack selection
task to Hammond 2013.
(a) Changes in quit attempts
One Australian study (Durkin 2015) assessed quit attempts in
four cohorts of adult smokers of factory-made or roll-your-own
cigarettes before and after standardised packaging. A second Aus-
tralian study (Young 2014) assessed calls to quitlines as an indirect
measure of quit attempts before and after standardised packaging
implementation.
(b) Smoking behaviour changes such as stubbing out a
cigarette early, forgoing cigarettes, smoking less around others
One Australian study (Durkin 2015) assessed stubbed-out
cigarettes in the past month and stopping oneself from smoking
several or many times in the past month, in four cohorts of adult
smokers of factory-made or roll-your-own cigarettes before and af-
ter standardised packaging. Two Australian studies (White 2015a;
Yong 2015) examined the impact of standardised packaging with
a specific focus on the impact of enhanced graphic warnings on
forgoing cigarettes. White 2015a assessed Australian adolescent
smokers and Yong 2015 adult smokers.Two Australian studies
(Zacher 2014; Zacher 2015) assessed the extent to which smok-
ers in café strips smoked less before, during and after standard-
ised packaging implementation. Nicholson 2015 assessed whether
those noticing warning labels in the past month were more likely
to say these labels led them to forgo at least one cigarette before
and after standardised packaging and enhanced health warnings
implementation in Australia.
Three experimental studies in the UK (Maynard 2015; Moodie
2011; Moodie 2013) assessed the impact of standardised packag-
ing on forgoing cigarettes, stubbing out cigarettes early, and smok-
ing less around others.
(c) Changes in avoidance behaviours
Two Australian studies (Wakefield 2015; Yong 2015) examined
the impact of standardised packaging of cigarettes with enhanced
graphic warnings on pack concealment in cross-sectional surveys
(Wakefield 2015) and a cohort survey (Yong 2015). Two further
Australian studies (Zacher 2014; Zacher 2015) assessed the ex-
tent to which smokers in café strips concealed their tobacco packs
before, during and after standardised packaging implementation.
Miller 2015 assessed retrospective reports of concealing or decant-
ing their products in cigar and cigarillo smokers in a March 2014
cross-sectional survey.
Three experimental studies in the UK (Maynard 2015; Moodie
2011; Moodie 2013) assessed the impact of standardised packag-
ing on keeping the pack out of sight and covering the pack.
(d) Eye-tracking
Four UK experimental studies measured eye fixations for differ-
ent pack designs using Eyelink II technology (Maynard 2013;
Maynard 2014; Munafò 2011) or model TX300 video eye tracker
(Shankleman 2015).
(e) Pack selection
Hogarth 2015 used two within-participant experiments to test
whether standardised versus branded cigarette pack stimuli would
differentially elicit instrumental tobacco-seeking in a nominal
Pavlovian to instrumental transfer (PIT) procedure with regular
smokers. At the end of three online between-participants exper-
imental studies in the USA, UK and Brazil (Hammond 2011;
Hammond 2013; White 2012) participants were asked to select a
pack they believed that they were going to be sent; one USA study
(Rousu 2013) involved an experimental design in which partici-
pants actually purchased the pack they were bidding for.

 Non-behavioural outcomes
Overall, 45 studies assessed the association or impact of stan-
dardised packaging on non-behavioural outcomes (61,437 partic-
ipants). We summarise these very briefly below, due to the number
of studies and outcomes; further detail on each can be found in
the Characteristics of included studies tables.
(a) Quit cognitions
Overall, 16 studies assessed quit cognitions and of these, six stud-
ies assessed changes in quit cognitions before and after stan-
dardised packaging implementation in Australia (Brennan 2015;
Durkin 2015; Wakefield 2013; Wakefield 2015; White 2015a;
Yong 2015).
Five studies from Australia assessed quit intentions/plans to quit
(Brennan 2015; Durkin 2015; Wakefield 2012; Wakefield 2013;
Yong 2015), although one of these (Wakefield 2012)wasanexperi-
mental studycarriedoutbefore standardisedpackagingimplemen-
tation in Australia. Eleven studies (four from Australia, four from
the UK, two from France and one from the USA) assessed mo-
tivation to quit smoking (Brose 2014; Gallopel-Morvan 2011;
Gallopel-Morvan 2015b; Maynard 2015; Mays 2015; Moodie
2011; Moodie 2013; Nicholson 2015; Wakefield 2013; Wakefield
2015; Yong 2015).Ten studies (six from Australia, three from
the UK and one from France) assessed thinking about quitting
(Brennan 2015; Durkin 2015; Gallopel-Morvan 2015a; Maynard
2015; Moodie 2011; Moodie 2013; Wakefield 2012; Wakefield
2013; White 2015a; Yong 2015).
(b) Intention to try smoking
Seven studies from Australia, China, Canada, France and the UK
(three studies) assessed intention to try smoking (Chow 2015;
Ford 2013; Gallopel-Morvan 2011; Hammond 2009; Hammond
2014; Kotnowski 2015; White 2015a). All included a measure
of intention to, or susceptibility to, initiate smoking among ado-
lescents/youth, and the one study in Australia which examined
changes before and after standardised packaging implementation
also included an indirect measure of susceptibility (White 2015a).
(c) Craving
Only one UK experimental study assessed craving: Brose 2014
carried out a between-participants experiment to assess craving
cued by seeing a branded or standardised pack.
(d) Positive pack attributes
30 studies assessed pack appeal; 21 studies assessed perceived taste
of tobacco in packs; 22 studies assessed quality (defined in various
ways including perceived quality, pack preference tasks in which
they were asked to choose a pack or which pack they preferred,
which pack was perceived to be most effective in motivating peo-
ple to buy cigarettes, expensive, satisfying, pleasurable, embarrass-
ment, image, more natural tobacco, lower class, prestige) (see Table
1, Table 2, and Table 3 for a list of studies and key characteristics).
(e) Health warnings and (f) Perceptions of harm
Nineteen studies measured salience of, recall and responses to
health warnings; 27 measured perceptions of harm (see Table 4
and Table 5 for a list of studies and key characteristics).
Excluded studies
As seen in Figure 2, we excluded 257 references at full-text stage.
One hundred and five of these were excluded as the article con-
tent was not about standardised packaging, 19 because they did
not measure any of our outcomes, 10 as they did not assess the
impact of changes in packaging, 18 as they were not peer-reviewed
published studies, 75 because they were not primary, empirical
studies (e.g. news stories, opinion pieces), and 24 because they
used qualitative methods. The remainder were excluded for other
reasons. We list key excluded studies along with their reasons for
exclusion in Characteristics of excluded studies. We list studies
which we are aware of but that were published after our search date
in Characteristics of studies awaiting classification; we will con-
sider these in future updates. We summarise key ongoing studies
in Characteristics of ongoing studies.
Risk of bias in included studies
Overall, we judged the vast majority of studies to be at high or
unclear risk of bias in at least one domain, reflecting the difficulties
intrinsic to studying this topic (and in studies assessing the impact
of standardised packaging in Australia, this was predominantly
due to confounding due to the simultaneous introduction of en-
hanced pictorial warnings). As described in Assessment of risk of
bias in included studies, we chose which domains to assess based
on study type. Given the volume of studies and the range of do-
mains assessed, we only briefly synthesise ’Risk of bias’ judgements
in the text. Further detail can be found in Figure 3, in Figure 4,
and particularly in the Characteristics of included studies, where
we provide our reasons for our judgements for each domain in
each included study. We used ’Risk of bias’ assessments when con-
sidering the strengths and limitations of our conclusions, but have
also considered them in relation to recommendations for further
research in this area.

 Overall risk of bias across studies
In four studies, ’Risk of bias’ assessments were low across all do-
mainsassessed(Gallopel-Morvan 2011; Maynard 2015; Wakefield
2008; Wakefield 2013); none of these were randomised controlled
trials and hence we did not assess them for selection or detection
bias. A further five studies were at unclear risk of bias (Babineau
2015; Guillaumier 2014; Hammond 2011; Mays 2015; Wakefield
2012). We judged all other studies to be at high risk of bias in at
least one of the domains assessed.
Summary of individual domains
Only one study used a traditional RCT design and hence we only
assessed selection bias and detection bias for this study (Maynard
2015). We judged it to be at low risk of both.
We assessed the remaining domains over most of the included
studies.
We assessed selective reporting for all included studies. This was
difficult to assess as protocols were not available for most studies;
where all expected outcomes were reported, we judged studies to
be at low risk of bias in this domain. We rated three studies as
unclear for selective reporting as it was not apparent why some
outcomes had been reported and not others; we judged all other
studies to be at low risk of bias for this domain (see Figure 3 and
Figure 4).
There were few issues raised with measurement of independent
or dependent variables, and we judged statistical methods to be
appropriate for most of the studies. More detail can be seen in
Figure 4 and Characteristics of included studies.
Judgements were mixed across sampling methods, with approxi-
mately half of the included studies rated at high risk of bias for
this domain, typically due to the use of convenience samples and
possible issues with contamination in some studies. Judgements
were also mixed for incomplete outcome data, with approximately
half of the studies assessed for this domain rated at unclear risk,
which was typically the case for observational survey-type studies
where there were insufficient data on which to judge the impact
of loss to follow-up and where sample sizes were heavily reduced
for some analyses because of missing data.
Finally, we rated just under half of the studies at high risk of bias for
confounding, which is likely to continue to be an issue for research
in this field, as enhanced pictorial warnings were implemented at
the same time as standardised packaging in Australia, and is likely
to be the case with countries that introduce standardised packaging
in the future (see Discussion and Summary of findings for the
main comparison). It is therefore difficult to separate the effects of
these two interventions. Hence, for all these studies, confounding
is rated as high, even though often the studies controlled for the
effect of other policies or interventions that happened around
the time of standardised packaging legislation implementation, or
other potential confounders.

Changes in tobacco use (primary outcomes)
No studies reported uptake, cessation, or relapse prevention mea-
sures. Results for prevalence and consumption are presented be-
low.
Prevalence
The one included study assessing the impact of standardised to-
bacco packaging on smoking prevalence in Australia (Diethelm
2015) found a 3.66% reduction in odds (P = 0.0061) when com-
paring before to after the implementation of standardised pack-
aging, adjusting for confounders (β = -0.0372, 95% confidence
interval (CI) -0.0638 to 0.0106; n = 700,000). This is consistent
with a drop in the proportion smoking from 19% to 18.5%, i.e. a
0.5 percentage point drop in smoking prevalence around the time
of the change.
Two further unpublished papers make use of the same data set
and hence are classed as additional references under Diethelm
2015. A paper written for the Australian government (Chipty
2016) detected very similar findings, despite using slightly differ-
ent methodological approaches; the authors found a statistically
significantdecline insmokingprevalence of 0.55percentage points
over the post-implementation period, relative to what the preva-
lence would have been without the implementation of standard-
ised packaging. A separate paper written for the tobacco industry
(Kaul 2014) did not detect an effect attributable to standardised
packaging; there are three key differences in their methods which
may have led to these different conclusions. Firstly, Kaul 2014
chose to model the overall time trend for a shorter period of time
(from July 2004 onwards, rather than from 2002); they state they
have done so because the trend appears non-linear in the first two
years compared to later years. However, the analysis in Diethelm
2015 makes some allowance for this by the inclusion of additional
covariates and hence Diethelm’s final model (unlike that of Kaul)
is not a simple linear time trend. Secondly, Kaul 2014 excludes
December 2012 from their analyses (when standardised packaging
came into effect), whereas both Diethelm 2015 and Chipty 2016
include this month; this appears to be a post hoc decision made
in the Kaul 2014 analysis. Thirdly, Kaul 2014 primarily analyses
residuals, rather than estimation of the trend before and after the
17

 implementation of standardised packaging, which Diethelm 2015
and Chipty 2016 have done.
Given the consistency in findings between Diethelm 2015 and
Chipty 2016 and given that Diethelm 2015 is the primary refer-
ence for this study (as the only peer-reviewed published reference
analysing this data set), our conclusions on this outcome are based
on those presented by Diethelm 2015.
No experimental studies looked at changes in prevalence.
Consumption
Impact of standardised packaging in Australia
Two studies assessed the impact of standardised tobacco packag-
ing on consumption in Australia. Scollo 2015 (8811 participants)
used the bespoke ‘National Tobacco Plain Packaging Tracking sur-
vey’ to assess changes in self-reported consumption (among cur-
rent smokers surveyed at three time periods): between the pre-
standardised packaging phase in Australia (pre: April to Septem-
ber 2012) and two subsequent time periods: the transition phase
during which standardised packages were being introduced into
the Australian market (transition: October and November 2012),
and one year post-standardised packaging phase (post: December
2012 to November 2013). No significant change was detected
in cigarette consumption among daily cigarette smokers, at least
weekly smokers, or at least monthly smokers, and among at least
monthly smokers of brands of any market segments (value/main-
stream/premium); the authors report that there was reasonable
power to detect modest changes for all categories.
Miller 2015 (268 participants) used one cross-sectional survey of a
national online panel developed from a number of sources includ-
ingadvertisingand‘word-of-mouth’ inAustralia. Smokersofcigars
or cigarillos, or of both, were asked to assess self-reported changes
in consumption since ‘two years ago’ (a period including the intro-
duction of standardised packaging.) Due to small cell sizes, only
simple descriptives were presented. For cigar smokers, 42% re-
ported lower consumption, 13% more, and 45% the same. For
cigarillo smokers 44% reported lower consumption, 15% more,
and 42% the same.
Other studies
Of the two UK experimental studies that assigned participants to
branded or standardised packs, Maynard 2015 (128 participants)
found that self-reported cigarette consumption did not differ sig-
nificantly during the 24-hour period between those smoking from
the branded pack (mean = 10.86) versus the standardised pack
(mean = 10.34), β = −0.58 (95% CI: −1.63 to + 0.48), P = 0.279
(adjusted). Similarly, Maynard 2015 found no differences across
a 24-hour period in the volume of smoke inhaled (mL) between
branded and standardised packs (branded pack mean = 765.15,
standardised mean = 817.26, β = +54.78 mL, 95% CI: -112.50 to
+222.07, P = 0.518 (adjusted)). Moodie 2013 (187 participants)
found that participants’ self-reported cigarette consumption was
lower when using the standardised compared with participants’
own branded pack. Moodie 2013 found the midweek average
cigarette consumption per day when using the standardised pack
was 14.9, compared with 15.5 while using own branded packs (P
< 0.05) and the weekend average cigarette consumption per day
was 15.7 while using standardised and 16.7 using own branded
packs (P < 0.01).
Changes in secondary behavioural outcomes
Changes in quit attempts
Two studies assessed the impact of standardised packaging on quit
attempts in Australia. In their study of Australian adult smoker
cohorts (Durkin 2015, 5441 participants), 1) before standardised
packaging implementation, during 2) early and 3) late implemen-
tation, and 4) one year post-implementation of standardised pack-
aging (but prior to the tax increase in December 2013), the ad-
justed proportions attempting to quit in the past month were: 1)
before: 20.2%; 2) early implementation: 25.5%, odds ratio (OR)
1.43, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.03, P < 0.05; 3) late implementation:
17.4%, OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.12, n.s.; one-year post: 26.6%,
OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.30, P < 0.05.
Calls to the Quitline are an indirect measure of quit attempts.
Young 2014 found that there was a 78% increase in the number
of calls to the Quitline in Australia associated with the introduc-
tion of standardised packaging (baseline, 363/week; peak, 651/
week, 95% CI 523 to 780/week; P < 0.001). This peak occurred
four weeks after the initial appearance of standardised packaging
and was prolonged (43 weeks) with an estimated 86% of these
additional calls retained relative to the previous week until the
end of the period of study. In comparison, the 2006 introduction
of graphic health warnings had the same relative increase in calls
(84%; baseline, 910/week; peak, 1673/week, 95% CI 1383 to
1963/week; P < 0.001), but the impact of standardised packaging
continued for a longer period of time as each post-week following
the graphic health warning introduction retained only 40% of the
previous week’s calls (for 20 weeks).
No experimental studies evaluated changes in quit attempts.
Smoking behaviour changes such as stubbing out a cigarette
early, forgoing cigarettes, smoking less around others
Impact of standardised packaging in Australia
Durkin 2015 (5441 participants), using adjusted analyses, found
that continuing smokers in Australia were significantly more likely
to report increases in stubbing out their cigarette early when com-
paring the year after standardised packaging was introduced to
18

 pre-standardised packaging, but not in the earlier implementation
phases (pre: 21.9% (reference); early implementation: 22.2%, OR
1.02 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.54); late implementation: 22.5%, OR
1.04, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.43; one year post-standardised packaging
(but prior to the tax increase in December 2013): 28.4%, OR
1.55, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.36, P < 0.05). In addition, continuing
smokers surveyed during early implementation were significantly
more likely to report increased rates of stopping themselves from
smoking when they had an urge compared to those surveyed in the
pre-standardised packaging phase (pre: 36.7%, (reference); early
implementation: 44.9%, OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.10, P <
0.05), but not at the two later follow-ups (late implementation:
39.4%, OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.52; one year post-standard-
ised packaging: 38.1%, OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.57).
Of the two Australian studies (Zacher 2014; Zacher 2015) that ex-
amined the impact of standardised packaging on smoking in out-
door cafes, Zacher 2014 observed that from the pre-standardised
packaging to the post-standardised packaging phases there was a
23% decline in active smoking observed (incident rate ratio (IRR)
0.77, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.84, P < 0.001). Adjusted Poisson regres-
sion models confirmed that the observed rate of packs to patrons
declined in the post-phase by 15%. The rate of observed smokers
to patrons also declined significantly (by 23%; IRR 0.77, 95% CI
0.71 to 0.84, P < 0.001) between phases, whereas the rate of vis-
ible packs to observed active smokers did not change (IRR 0.04,
95% CI 0.96 to 1.13). In Zacher 2015, which extended the study
to one year post-standardised packaging, the prevalence of active
smoking observed declined, from 8.4% of patrons pre- to 6.4%
early post-implementation (IRR 0.78, P < 0.001), and remained
lower (at 6.8%) one year post-implementation (IRR 0.85, P =
0.013), and there was no change between early and one year post-
implementation (IRR 1.08, P = 0.607). There was a significant
interaction for the rate of observed active smoking among patrons
between pre-implementation and one year post-implementation
and the presence of children at a venue (P = 0.015), with a greater
decline in venues with children present (IRR 0.47, P < 0.001) than
in those without (IRR 0.88, P = 0.058).
In Nicholson 2015 (1643 participants), smokers were asked if they
had noticed the warning labels on their packs in the last month
and then whether the warning labels stopped them from having a
smoke when they were about to. Smokers who had noticed warn-
ing labels in the last month were more likely to say that these labels
led them to forgo at least one cigarette after standardised packaging
implementation compared with before (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.14
to 2.09). However, Yong 2015 (1525 participants) found there
was no significant change in warning-related forgoing of cigarettes
from pre- to post-standardised packaging among adult smokers (β
= 0.01; standard error (SE) = 0.02, non-significant (n.s.)). Sim-
ilarly, when White 2015a (7740 participants) asked adolescent
smokers(establishedandnon-established)whohadseenacigarette
pack in the past six months whether they had not had a cigarette
because of the health warnings, there was no significant change
in the frequency of not having a cigarette because of the health
warnings in 2011 pre-standardised packaging versus 2013 post-
standardised packaging (F = 1183) 0.042, P = 0.52).
Other studies
Findings were mixed in the three UK experimental studies that
assigned participants to branded or standardised packs. Maynard
2015 (128 participants) found no difference in smoking be-
haviours over the 24-hour period: 1) reporting stubbing out a
cigarette early (standardised versus branded β = 0.03, 95% CI -
0.14 to 0.20, P = 0.723); 2) forgoing a cigarette (standardised ver-
sus branded β = 0.03, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.19, P = 0.744); and 3)
smoking less around others (standardised versus branded β = 0.07,
95% CI -0.09 to 0.22, P = 0.401). Moodie 2011 (48 participants)
reported that young adult smokers were more likely to engage
in changes in their smoking behaviour when using the standard-
ised packs compared to branded packs; over the four-week study
period, participants completed a questionnaire twice a week: (1)
the proportion reporting forgoing cigarettes: standardised = 15%
versus branded = 4% (n.s); standardised = 20% versus branded =
6% (n.s.); standardised = 19% versus branded = 6% (P < 0.05);
standardised = 30% versus branded = 9% (P < 0.05) for the four
questionnaires respectively; (2) smoking less around others (at all
four time points = significant): standardised = 33% versus branded
= 11% (P < 0.01); standardised = 37% versus branded = 10% (P
< 0.01); standardised = 46% versus branded = 13% (P < 0.001);
standardised = 44% versus branded = 7% (P < 0.001) for the
four questionnaires respectively. Moodie 2013 (187 participants)
found that young female daily smokers reported changing their
smoking behaviour in a number of ways over the one-week period
when using standardised packs compared with using their own
branded packs, through: foregoing cigarettes (13% reported this
behaviour versus 4%, P < 0.01 midweek; 15% versus 8%, P < 0.05
weekend) and smoking less around others (33% versus 11%, P <
0.001 midweek; 39% versus 16%, P < 0.001 weekend). Stubbing
out cigarettes was more frequent when using standardised packs
than their own branded packs, for the weekend (17% reported
this behaviour versus 10% respectively, P < 0.05), but not for the
midweek measure (10% versus 5% respectively, n.s.).
Changes in avoidance behaviours
Impact of standardised packaging in Australia
Wakefield 2015 (7175 participants) found no immediate change
in the proportion of Australian smokers who reported concealing
their packs or using a different container for their cigarettes, but
reports that there was an increase in these behaviours from pre- to
one yearpost-standardisedpackaging: pre-standardisedpackaging:
17.1% (reference); transition: 19.1%, OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.90 to
1.46, P = 0.252; one-year post-standardised packaging (but prior

 to the tax increase in December 2013): 23.1%, OR 1.47, 95% CI
1.26 to 1.71, P < 0.001. There was an immediate and sustained
increase in the proportion who had requested a different graphic
heath warning when purchasing a pack in the past month (hence
avoiding particular health warnings): pre-standardised packaging:
3.9% (reference); transition: 8.5%, OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.52 to
3.44, P < 0.001; one-year post-standardised packaging: 9.1%, OR
2.49, 95% CI 1.89 to 3.29, P < 0.001.
Yong 2015 (1525 participants) found a large increase in avoid-
ance behaviour regarding warning labels (made any effort to avoid
looking at or thinking about the warning labels, such as covering
them up, keeping them out of sight, using a cigarette case, avoid-
ing certain warnings, or any other means) from pre- to post-stan-
dardised packaging (OR 3.06, P < 0.001) in their cohort study of
smokers from pre- to post-implementation. Changing attentional
orientation (smokers were asked when they look at a cigarette pack
whether they usually notice the warning labels or branding first)
affected avoidance behaviours: shifting from first not focusing to
focusing first on the health warning labels (from pre- to post-
waves) was associated with an increase in avoidance of warning la-
bels (β = 0.08, P = 0.07) compared with those who first focused on
the pack branding at each wave. In contrast, changing the initial
focus away from the warnings was significantly associated with a
decline in avoidance behaviour (β = −0.19, P = 0.06) compared
with those who first focused on warning labels at both waves.
Zacher 2014 observed that concealment of tobacco packs outside
cafes (by a telephone, wallet or some other object) increased signif-
icantly between pre- and early post-standardised packaging (IRR
2.33, 95% CI 1.72 to 3.17, P < 0.001), from 4.4% of fully branded
packs pre- to 9.5% of standardised packs post-standardised pack-
aging. Zacher 2015 found that whilst pack concealment increased
between the pre- (branded packs: 4.0%) and early post-standard-
ised packaging (standardised packs: 8.9%) phases (IRR 2.48, P <
0.001), concealment resumed its baseline level by one year post-
PP (standardised packs: 4.4%, IRR 1.22, P = 1.00). Zacher 2014
observed that the use of external cigarette cases was significantly
more common in the post-standardised packaging phase (3.5%)
than pre- (1.5%) (IRR 2.79, 95% CI 1.77 to 4.40, P < 0.001).
Zacher 2015 observed that the prevalence of external case use in-
creased between pre- (1.2%) and early post-standardised packag-
ing (3.5%, IRR 3.44, P = 0.001), at one year post-standardised
packaging (1.9%, IRR 1.36, P > 0.999), there was no evidence
of a difference from pre-standardised packaging. Zacher 2014 ob-
served that the proportion of packs orientated face-up declined
from 85.4% of fully branded packs pre- to 73.6% of standardised
packs post-implementation (IRR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.95, P
= 0.002). Zacher 2015 observed that the percentage of packs ori-
ented face-up declined from pre- (branded packs: 85.2%) to early
post-implementation (standardised packs: 74.0%, IRR 0.87, P =
0.037), but returned to the baseline level one year post-standard-
ised packaging (standardised packs: 85.7%, IRR 0.99, P = 1.000).
Miller 2015 (268 participants) observed that among cigar and
cigarillo smokers’ reports 11% self-reported deliberately conceal-
ing or decanting their products more often than “two years ago”
(a period including the introduction of standardised packaging),
21% less often and 56% the same.
Other studies
In the UK, experimental studies had similar outcomes in which
avoidance behaviours increased. Maynard 2015 (128 participants)
found a significant increase in avoidance behaviours over the 24-
hour experimental period: 1) those assigned standardised packs
were more likely to report keeping the pack out of sight than those
assigned branded packs (β = 0.15, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.29, P = 0.031)
and more likely to report covering the pack (β = 0.08, 95% CI
0.00 to 0.16, P = 0.044). Moodie 2011 (48 participants) found
that young adult smokers were more likely to engage in avoidant
behaviours at each time point (four questionnaires taken over the
two-week period): 1) Keeping the pack out of sight: branded =
13% versus standardised = 53%, P < 0.001; branded = 13% versus
standardised = 53%, P < 0.001; branded = 13% versus standard-
ised = 60%, P < 0.001; branded = 7% versus standardised = 57%,
P < 0.001, for the four questionnaires respectively. 2) Covering
the pack: branded = 4% versus standardised = 22%, P < 0.01;
branded = 2% versus standardised = 26%, P < 0.01; branded =
4% versus standardised = 26%, P < 0.01; branded = 4% versus
standardised = 30%, P < 0.001, for the four questionnaires respec-
tively. Moodie 2013 (187 participants) found that young female
smokers were more likely to engage in avoidant behaviours, when
smoking standardised packs versus branded packs at the two time
points over each one-week period: keeping the pack out of sight
(54% standardised versus 11% branded, P < 0.001 midweek; 55%
versus 10%, P < 0.001 weekend); covering the pack (10% stan-
dardised versus 2% branded, P < 0.001 midweek; 21% versus 3%
respectively, P < 0.001 weekend).
Eye tracking (movements and fixations)
In their study of adults, Munafò 2011 (43 participants) assessed
the number of eye saccades (movements) and duration of fixa-
tions, in a mixed 3x2x2 experimental design, assessing smoking
status (non-smoker, weekly smoker, daily smoker) as a between-
participants factor, pack type (branded, standardised) and location
of eye gaze (health warning, brand information) as within-partic-
ipant factors. A main effect of package type was observed (F (1,
39) = 5.51, P = 0.024) and further analyses, stratified by smoking
status, clarified the nature of an observed three-way interaction.
This indicated the presence of a pack type/location interaction
among non-smokers (F (1, 13) = 17.63, P = 0.001, h2 = 0.58)
and weekly smokers (F (1, 12) = 17.06, P = 0.001, h2 = 0.59), but
not daily smokers (F (1, 12) = 0.95, P = 0.35, h2 = 0.07). This
interaction in non-smokers and weekly smokers reflected an equal
number of eye movements towards health warning and brand in-
formation on branded packs, but greater eye movements towards
20

 health warning information and fewer towards brand information
on standardised packs. These effects were not observed for the du-
ration of individual fixations, which confirmed that the results for
number of saccades could not be explained by fewer but prolonged
fixations on brand names for standardised packs in non-smokers
and weekly smokers. Instead, this suggests that these groups show
increased visual attention towards health warnings on standard-
ised packs.
In their study of adolescents, Maynard 2013 (87 participants) as-
sessed the number of eye saccades in a mixed 4x2x2 experimental
design, with smoking status (never-smoker, experimental smoker,
weekly smoker, daily smoker) as a between-participants factor, and
pack type (branded, standardised) and location of eye gaze (health
warning, branding) as within-participant factors. They also found
evidence of a three-way interaction (F (3, 83) = 4.138, P = 0.009,
partial eta squared = 0.130). Further analyses, stratified by smok-
ing status, clarified the nature of this as indicating the presence
of a pack type/location interaction among experimenters (F (1,
33) = 17.62, P < 0.001) and weekly smokers (F (1, 12) = 4.91,
P = 0.047), but not among never-smokers (F (1, 25) = 0.24, P =
0.63) or daily smokers (F (1, 13) = 0.87, P = 0.37). For experi-
menters and weekly smokers, this interaction was characterised by
an equal number of eye movements towards the health warnings
and branding on branded packs (experimenters: t(33) = 0.41, P
= 0.68; weekly smokers: t(12) = 0.56, P = 0.58), but more eye
movements towards health warnings than branding on standard-
ised packs (experimenters: t(33) = 2.69, P = 0.011; weekly smok-
ers: t(12) = 2.25, P = 0.044). Among never-smokers, a main ef-
fect of location was observed, (F (1, 25) = 6.95, P = 0.014), re-
flecting more eye movements towards the health warnings than
the branding; a main effect of pack type (F (1, 25) = 11.36, P =
0.002) was also observed, indicating more eye movements overall
to branded packs than standardised packs. No main effect of pack
type or location was observed among daily smokers. Analysis of
the time per image spent fixating health warnings compared to
branding confirmed that experimental and weekly smokers spent
more time fixating health warnings on standardised packs than on
branded packs. Compared with branded packaging, standardised
packaging increased the time spent attending the warnings com-
pared with the branding among experimenters and weekly smok-
ers, but not daily smokers who made equal numbers of eye move-
ments to the warnings on branded and standardised packs. Unlike
with adults, adolescent never-smokers preferentially attended to
the health warnings irrespective of whether presented on branded
or standardised packs.
In their study of adult regular smokers, Maynard 2014 (30 par-
ticipants) used a within-participant design with location of eye
gaze (health warning, branding), pack type (branded, standard-
ised, blank) and health warning familiarity (familiar, unfamiliar)
as within-participant factors. Analysis of variance indicated that
smokers were biased towards fixating the branding rather than the
health warning on all three pack types (branded packs: t(29) =
13.12, P < 0.001, d = 2.44; standardised packs: t(29) = 10.59, P <
0.001, d = 2.05; blank packs: (t(29) = 3.40, P = 0.002, d = 0.69).
For blank packs this meant that smokers preferentially attended
to the blank region over the health warnings. However, more sac-
cades were made to branding on branded packs than standardised
packs (t(28) = 5.47, P < 0.001, d = 0.35), and on branded packs
(t(28) = 12.56, P < 0.001, d = 1.06) and standardised packs (t(28)
= 8.97, P < 0.001, d = 0.76) than blank packs. Conversely, an equal
number of saccades were made to health warnings on branded
and standardised packs (t(28) < 0.001, P = 1.00, d = 0.08), but
more saccades were made to health warnings on blank packs than
either branded (t(28) = 3.85, P < 0.001, d = 0.53) or standardised
packs (t(28) = 4.00, P < 0.001, d = 0.44). There was no main
effect of familiarity of health warnings and no interactions includ-
ing this factor, even when the number of cigarettes participants
reported smoking per day (a proxy for familiarity) was included
as a covariate in the ANOVA. Familiarity with health warnings
had no effect on eye-gaze location. The results suggest that health
warning familiarity is not the reason for regular smokers’ lack of
visual attention to health warnings; instead, both a preference for
branding and an active avoidance of warnings may explain regular
smokers’ lack of attention to health warnings.
Shankleman 2015 assessed the proportion of gaze time spent
on health warnings in a study of 30 adult non-smokers (< 100
cigarettes in lifetime and not current), using a within-participant
design with pack type (branded, standardised) and type of health
warning (black & white text-only warning, graphic colour warn-
ings containing an image alongside a text warning, and colour
text-only warning) as within-participant factors. They observed
that gaze time towards different types of warnings increased when
they were presented on standardised packs compared to branded
packs (F (1,29) = 26.9, P < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.481). There was
no interaction between pack type and warning type (F (2,58) =
1.25, P = 0.295, partial η2 = 0.041), so the effect of standardised
packaging on gaze time did not vary significantly for the three
different types of warning.
Pack selection tasks
In Hogarth 2015 (144 participants), standardised pack stimuli,
unlike branded pack stimuli, did not prime tobacco choice in
either of two experiments, irrespective of whether the tobacco
reward was a branded 10-pack or a branded/standardised 20-pack.
In a pack selection task (Hammond 2011) in the USA, 38.5%
(318/826) of the female youth participants (smokers and non-
smokers) selected a pack. Significantly fewer respondents selected
a standardised versus (male or female) branded pack (Chi2 = 29.0,
P < 0.001). When excluding branded packs designed to appeal
mainly to males (given participants were female), the branded
packs designed to appeal mainly to females were 2.7 times more
likely to be selected than the standardised packs (using the same
brand names as the brands that would appeal mainly to females)

 (43.4% versus 16.4%; Chi2 = 38.9, P < 0.001).
In a similar pack selection task among young women in Brazil
(White 2012), overall 52.1% (325/640) selected a pack, 39.6%
of participants chose a branded pack and 12.5% a standardised
pack.
In a similar pack selection task with UK female youth (Hammond
2013), overall 48.4% of participants accepted the offer and se-
lected a pack (458/947 participants). Of the participants offered
four branded packs designed to appeal to females, significantly
more (51.8%) accepted a pack compared to participants offered
the same four packs with standardised packaging (44.6% of par-
ticipants accepted a pack). Overall, respondents offered standard-
ised packs were significantly less likely than respondents in the
branded pack condition (Chi2 = 5.0, P = 0.026) to accept a pack.
Rousu 2013 (402participants)askedsmokerstobidforfourdiffer-
ent types of packs in an auction: one pack was standardised (in this
experiment the packaging retained brand names and descriptors
in non-standardised fonts), which attracted a lower bid than the
other branded conditions. In other analyses of the same data, some
evidence emerged that standardised packaging caused a greater
proportion of smokers to decrease their demand for cigarettes.
Secondary outcomes (non-behavioural outcomes)
Quitting cognitions
Quit intentions/plans
Five studies from Australia assessed quit intentions/plans (
Brennan 2015; Durkin 2015; Wakefield 2012; Wakefield 2013;
Yong 2015), with mixed results.
Impact of standardised packaging in Australia
Four studies assessed the impact of standardised packaging im-
plementation on quit intentions/plans. A cross-sectional study
(Wakefield 2013, 536 participants) found no association between
use of standardised versus branded packs on planning to quit in
the next 30 days during implementation of standardised packag-
ing. A series of cohorts found a short-lived increase in intentions
to quit among continuing smokers surveyed towards the end of
standardised packaging implementation compared with before,
although this effect was not sustained one year after implemen-
tation (Durkin 2015, 5441 participants). Yong 2015 in a cohort
survey of smokers (1525 participants) found that a greater num-
ber of measures in relation to reactions to health warnings were
predictive of intention to quit, shortly after standardised pack-
aging implementation, than before. A second study, involving a
series of cohort surveys found that reactions to health warnings
predicted intentions to quit during the first year following imple-
mentation of standardised packaging (Brennan 2015, 3125 partic-
ipants); Brennan 2015 also found that intentions were predicted
by more concern than enjoyment, and disagreeing that the dangers
of smoking have been exaggerated.
Other studies
One experimental study found no effect of viewing standardised
or branded packaging on quit intentions (Wakefield 2012, 1203
participants).
Motivation to quit smoking
Twelve studies from Australia, the USA, France and the UK
assessed motivation to quit smoking, also with mixed results
(Brose 2014; Gallopel-Morvan 2011; Gallopel-Morvan 2012;
Gallopel-Morvan 2015b; Maynard 2015; Mays 2015; Moodie
2011; Moodie 2013; Nicholson 2015; Wakefield 2013; Wakefield
2015; Yong 2015).
Impact of standardised packaging in Australia
Four studies assessed the impact of standardised packaging imple-
mentation in Australia on motivation to quit smoking. One cross-
sectional survey (Wakefield 2013, 536 participants) found no dif-
ference in seriously considering quitting in the next six months,
between those adults smoking tobacco in standardised packs ver-
sus those smoking tobacco from their own branded packs when
standardised packs were being introduced. There was, however, a
relationship between standardised packaging and health warnings
on motivation to quit: Yong 2015 (1525 participants) in a cohort
survey found that smokers, shortly after standardised packaging
implementation, were more likely to agree that warning labels on
cigarette packs made them “more likely to quit smoking” than
prior to implementation; Wakefield 2015 (7175 participants), in
cross-sectional tracking surveys, found that a greater proportion
of smokers credited the graphic health warnings with providing
“much more motivation to quit” one year after standardised pack-
aging was introduced than pre-standardised packaging. Similarly,
Nicholson 2015 (1643 participants), in serial cross-sectional sur-
veys, found that Aboriginal or Torres Straits Islander smokers were
just as likely to recall noticing warning labels before and after stan-
dardised packaging was introduced, but after standardised packag-
ing was implemented they were more likely to believe the warning
labels made them more likely to quit.
Other studies
In a USA online experimental study, Mays 2015 (740 partici-
pants) found that those who viewed gain-framed warnings on stan-
dardised packs reported greater motivation to quit than partic-
ipants who viewed loss-framed warnings on standardised packs.

 Gallopel-Morvan 2011 (836 participants) conducted a cross-sec-
tional study in France, in which participants viewed images of var-
ious packs, and found that standardised packaging was perceived
to be more effective for motivating smokers to quit compared to
branded packs. In experimental studies (in the UK and France),
findings were mixed. Moodie 2011 (48 participants) and Moodie
2013 (187 participants), in studies involving the use of standard-
ised packs, found that those using standardised packs, on about
half of the occasions when measurements were taken, were signif-
icantly more likely to want to quit than those smoking branded
packs, whereas Maynard 2015 (128 participants) found no dif-
ference in the contemplation ladder (an assessment of readiness
to consider stopping smoking) when smokers used standardised
packs for 24 hours. Brose 2014 (98 participants) also found no
effect on motivation to quit in an experimental study in the UK
where young smokers handled branded versus standardised packs;
Gallopel-Morvan 2015b (142 participants), however, found that
when using standardised packs, participants were more motivated
to stop than when using branded packs, and more likely to search
for information on quitting.
Thinking about quitting
Ten studies from Australia, France and the UK assessed thinking
about quitting (Brennan 2015; Durkin 2015; Gallopel-Morvan
2015a; Maynard 2015; Moodie 2011; Moodie 2013; Wakefield
2012; Wakefield 2013; White 2015a; Yong 2015).
Impact of standardised packaging in Australia
Five studies assessed the impact of standardised packaging in
Australia on thoughts about quitting, with mixed results. One
cross-sectional study (Wakefield 2013, 536 participants) that as-
sessed the impact of standardised packaging during implementa-
tion found that adult smokers who used standardised packs were
more likelytothinkaboutquittingandrate quitting asahigherpri-
ority in their lives compared to those who smoked from their own
branded packs. However, using a series of cohort studies, Durkin
2015 (5441 participants) found no significant differences in the
proportion of continuing smokers who changed their thoughts
about quitting to at-least-daily at follow-up, compared to those in
the pre-standardised packaging cohort. An Australian cohort study
that assessed the impact of standardised packaging pre- and post-
implementation (one year after) of standardised packaging (Yong
2015, 1525 participants) found that adult smokers who used stan-
dardised packs were more likely to think that the warning labels led
them to think about quitting compared to pre-standardised pack-
aging, whereas a cross-sectional, pre-post standardised packaging
study among past-year adolescent smokers found no difference in
thinking about quitting because of the warnings (White 2015a,
7740 participants). Brennan 2015 (3125 participants) found that
in the first year of standardised packaging, thoughts about quitting
were related to disliking the look of their pack, less satisfaction
from their cigarettes compared to a year ago, disagreeing that the
dangers of smoking had been exaggerated, attributing much more
motivation to quit to graphic health warnings, and pack conceal-
ment in the past month.
Other studies
In five experimental studies, three (368 participants) found that
using standardised packs was associated with increased thoughts
about quitting (Gallopel-Morvan 2015a; Moodie 2011; Moodie
2013), whereas two studies (1331 participants) did not (Maynard
2015; Wakefield 2012).
Intention to try smoking
Seven studies from Australia, China, Canada, France and the
UK assessed intention to try smoking (Chow 2015; Ford 2013;
Gallopel-Morvan 2011; Hammond 2009; Hammond 2014;
Kotnowski 2015; White 2015a).
Impact of standardised packaging in Australia
White 2015a (7740 participants) assessed Australian adolescent
students in two cross-sectional school-based surveys before and
after standardised packaging, and found that among those who
had seen a cigarette pack in the last six months, there was a sig-
nificant decrease in the proportion responding “don’t know” and
“disagreeing” that “some brands are easier to smoke than others”,
following the implementation of standardised packaging. In the
same study, an indirect measure was used to assess susceptibility
to smoking among never-smokers who had seen a cigarette pack
in the last six months; the proportion of students reporting that
none of their five closest friends smoked was significantly greater
after standardised packaging than before. Moreover, among those
who had seen a cigarette pack in the last six months, the propor-
tion of non-susceptible non-smokers increased significantly and
the proportion of current and experimental smokers significantly
decreased.
Other studies
In an online within-participant panel experiment in the UK
(Hammond 2009, 516 participants) involving branded and stan-
dardised (brown and white) pack images, in all branded versus
standardised comparisons, youth stated that they were less likely
to try the standardised pack if they were to try smoking. Addi-
tionally when presented with two standardised packs only, but
differing by having a descriptor versus no-descriptor condition,
respondents were more likely to report trying standardised packs
if they included the adjectives smooth or gold, than standardised
packs without those terms. When comparing standardised packs
(with and without descriptors), significantly fewer youth perceived

T

 differences in trying smoking across the standardised packs, com-
pared with their responses to the same branded comparisons (with
and without descriptors). A similar online within-participant ex-
periment in the UK (Hammond 2014, 762 participants) found
that youth were less likely to report that the standardised packs
would make them want to try smoking (regardless of health warn-
ing label size and type, and brown or white colour) in comparison
to the branded packs. There were no differences for either colour
(brown versus white) of standardised packs. In a cross-sectional
survey in the UK with 1025 never-smoking 11- to 16-year-olds
(Ford 2013), a standardised pack was significantly less likely to
tempt participants to smoke than the branded pack, P < 0.001. A
between-participants experiment in China (Chow 2015) that in-
cluded 116 non-smoking 18- to 22-year-olds found no difference
in intention to smoke between those viewing branded and stan-
dardised packs, although there was an interaction between pack-
aging and brand familiarity such that the familiarity of the brand
exerted a moderating effect on the impact of packaging on inten-
tion to smoke. In an online survey in Canada (Kotnowski 2015)
among 448 female young smokers and non-smokers who viewed
packs with different packaging attributes (structure, brand, brand-
ing, warning label size and price), pack structure (traditional, lip-
stick, slim, booklet) was the most influential factor in motivating
trial intent among females, accounting for 46% of the variation,
and branding accounted for 18% of the variance where partici-
pants were more likely to want to try the branded rather than stan-
dardised packs. In a cross-sectional face-to-face interview study
in France (Gallopel-Morvan 2011), in which 836 smoking and
non-smoking adults viewed images of various packs, respondents
were more likely to state that the standardised packs would prevent
adolescents from starting to smoke and less likely to say that they
would increase consumption among youth, compared to branded
packs. Respondents also believed that branded packs were more
intended for adolescents than the standardised packs.
Craving
A between-participants face-to-face experiment with young adult
smokers recruited 98 participants from a university online par-
ticipant pool in the UK (Brose 2014), and found significantly
lower ratings for craving after viewing standardised versus branded
packs. A mixed model ANCOVA showed a significant interaction
of packaging and before and after viewing pack (F (2,94) = 8.77,
P < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.16) for standardised packs than preferred
(their own pack) and non-preferred branded packs. There was no
difference between the two branded pack conditions.
Positive attributes
Appeal, taste and quality were evaluated in a range of ways across
a large number of studies. Given the large volume of data, we have
tabulated the results (see Table 1; Table 2; Table 3), but we also
summarise them briefly by outcome and population group below.
Appeal
Thirty studies assessed appeal. Details of individual studies and
their outcomes can be found in Table 1.
Impact of standardised packaging in Australia
Five studies (32,852 participants) assessed the impact of standard-
ised packaging implementation in Australia on appeal (Balmford
2015; Dunlop 2015; Miller2015; Wakefield 2015; White 2015a):
four with adults (Balmford 2015; Dunlop 2015; Miller 2015;
Wakefield 2015) and one with adolescents (White 2015a). All
found appeal ratings to be higher for branded compared with stan-
dardised packs.
Other studies
Of the remaining studies, 10 evaluated measures of appeal in
adult smokers (Borland 2013; Brose 2014; Gallopel-Morvan
2015a; Gallopel-Morvan 2015b; Guillaumier 2014; Maynard
2015; Moodie 2011; Moodie 2013; Wakefield 2008; Wakefield
2012). The nine of these that compared standardised with branded
packs found appeal ratings to be higher with branded packs (3106
participants). A further study (Borland 2013, 160 participants)
found that among five standardised packs which differed by pack
shape and opening, the shape of the standardised pack signifi-
cantly affected attractiveness, with rounded and bevelled packs
rated as the most attractive; there was no effect of the different
openings on attractiveness of the standardised packs. One study
evaluated appeal in adult non-smokers: Chow 2015 (116 partici-
pants) found that likeability was higher for familiar brands when
in branded or standardised packs but that there was no evidence
for a difference in likeability between branded and standardised
packs when the brands were unfamiliar. A further five studies eval-
uated appeal in adult samples, including both smokers and non-
smokers. In Adkison 2014; Bansal-Travers 2011; Doxey 2011;
Gallopel-Morvan 2011 (total of 2630 participants), branded packs
were rated higher on measures of attractiveness and appeal than
standardised packaging. Hammond 2011 (826 participants), con-
ducted in women, also found that standardised packs (of ‘female’
brands) were given significantly lower appeal ratings than the fe-
male-branded (with or without descriptors), and male-branded
packs.
Six studies evaluated measures of appeal in people under the
age of 18. Four of these were conducted in samples including
smokers and non-smokers. In the four which compared branded
and standardised packaging (4174 participants), all found appeal
and attractiveness ratings to be lower for standardised packaging
(Babineau 2015; Germain 2010; Hammond 2013; Hammond
2014). In a further study (Moodie 2012, 658 participants), when
assessing different structural designs for standardised packs, 42%
expressed a preference for a pack design they liked the most (50%
24
T

 no preference, 8% ’don’t know’), with 10% preferring the regular
flip-top, 25% the slide-pack and 7% superslims. In one study in
1025 non-smoking youth (Ford 2013), a composite pack appraisal
(appeal) score was significantly lower for a standardised pack com-
pared with a traditional flip-top branded pack, which was signifi-
cantly lower than two novelty structural design packs (superslims
and pack with an innovative opening).
A further three studies evaluated appeal in samples including peo-
ple over and under the age of 18; all had findings consistent
with those above. In Hammond 2009 (516 participants), adult
smokers and youth perceived the standardised packs as signifi-
cantly less attractive; within standardised pack comparisons, packs
with descriptors (such as smooth, gold) were perceived as signif-
icantly more attractive than those without descriptors, for both
adult smokers and youth. Gallopel-Morvan 2012 (540 partici-
pants) found that a branded pack was rated significantly higher
than standardised packs for “attention grabbing”, “flashy”, “at-
tractive”, “nice”, “trendy”; there were no differences between the
three standardised packs for these attributes, except for “flashy” -
a brown standardised pack was rated as significantly more “flashy”
than a white standardised pack. White 2012 (640 participants)
found that branded packs were rated as significantly more ap-
pealing than standardised packs with and without descriptors; the
standardised packs with descriptors were also rated as significantly
more appealing than the standardised no-descriptor packs.
Taste
Twenty-one studies assessed perceptions of taste based on the ap-
pearance of standardised packs. Details of individual studies and
their outcomes can be found in Table 2.
Impact of standardised packaging in Australia
Two studies (Miller 2015; Wakefield 2015), both in adult smok-
ers, assessed the impact of standardised packaging in Australia on
perceived taste of tobacco products. Wakefield 2015 (7175 par-
ticipants) found no change in perceived differences in taste of
different brands, during transition or at one-year post-standard-
ised packaging compared to pre-standardised packaging; Miller
2015 (268 participants) found that cigars and cigarillo smokers
most commonly reported (66%) that the product they currently
smoked was “about the same” (in terms of taste and enjoyment,
one measure) compared with “two years ago” (a period including
the introduction of standardised packaging), while 19% reported
reduced/lower taste and 15% reported improved taste.
Other studies
Seven remaining studies evaluated perceptions of taste in adult
smokers, with most finding lower perceived taste for standard-
ised packs. Maynard 2015 (128 participants) found no signifi-
cant differences between branded and standardised packs on taste;
four studies (1576 participants) found taste ratings to be signif-
icantly worse for standardised packs compared to branded packs
(Brose 2014; Gallopel-Morvan 2015a; Gallopel-Morvan 2015b;
Wakefield 2012); Guillaumier 2014 (354 participants) found that
branded packs were rated significantly more appealing on taste
attributes than standardised packaging for one of the brand pair
comparisons but not for the other; and in Wakefield 2008 (813
participants), although there were no significant differences be-
tween the three standardised packs and the branded pack for the
statement “tastes like cheap tobacco”, the two least branded stan-
dardised packs were rated as significantly lower for the statement
“rich in tobacco”. Four further studies (2735 participants) evalu-
ated measures of taste in adult smokers and non-smokers; in all
four, tobacco in branded packs was rated more highly than tobacco
in standardised packs for taste (Adkison 2014; Bansal-Travers
2011; Doxey 2011; Hammond 2011).
A further four studies measured perceptions of taste in youth sam-
ples which included smokers and non-smokers. Results generally
found lower perceived taste for standardised packs, but this varied
according to the colour of the standardised pack. In Hammond
2013 (947 participants), tobacco in standardised packs received
significantly worse taste ratings compared to branded conditions;
and Germain 2010 (1087 participants) found that in comparison
with a branded pack, tobacco in the plainest standardised pack
was rated more negatively in terms of positive taste characteris-
tics, with no differences between the branded pack and the other
two standardised pack conditions. Colour was important in the
remaining two studies: Hammond 2014 (762 participants) found
that compared with branded packs, the standardised packs with
picture warnings on a brown but not white colour were signif-
icantly less likely to be perceived as having a smooth taste; and
Moodie 2012 (658 participants) found that when assessing differ-
ent colours for standardised packs, the red-coloured standardised
pack tended to be associated with stronger taste, there was no clear
pattern with green, and the lighter colours were generally associ-
ated with weaker taste.
Four studies evaluated measures of taste in both children and
adults. Again, standardised packs were generally rated as signifi-
cantlyworse-tastingthanbrandedpacks, butthere wasvariationby
colour, presence of descriptors and structure. In Hammond 2009
(516 participants), adult smokers were significantly more likely to
perceive brown but not white standardised packs as less smooth-
tasting than their branded counterparts; youth were also signif-
icantly more likely to perceive the brown packs as less smooth-
tasting than their branded counterparts, but also in one out of the
two white standardised pack/branded pack comparisons. Within
standardised pack comparisons, standardised packs with descrip-
tors (such as smooth, gold) were significantly more likely to be
perceived as smoother-tasting than those without, for adult smok-
ers and youth. In Kotnowski 2015 (448 participants), a lipstick-
25
T

 designed pack structure and slim pack were perceived to taste sig-
nificantly better than the traditional pack structure (there was no
difference in taste perceptions between a booklet-designed pack
and the traditional pack structure); respondents were significantly
more likely to rate branded packaging as the pack that would
contain better-tasting cigarettes compared to standardised packs.
White 2012 (640 participants) found that branded packs had sig-
nificantly higher taste ratings than standardised packs with and
without descriptors; the standardised packs with descriptors were
also rated as having significantly higher taste ratings than the stan-
dardised no-descriptor packs. Gallopel-Morvan 2012 (540 partic-
ipants) found that grey and white standardised packs were rated
as significantly lighter-tasting than the branded pack and a brown
standardised pack.
Quality, value and demand
Twenty-two studies assessed quality. Details of individual studies
and their outcomes can be found in Table 3.
Impact of standardised packaging in Australia
Four studies (9903 participants) assessed the impact of standard-
ised packaging implementation in Australia on perceived quality
of tobacco among adult smokers (Balmford 2015; Miller 2015;
Wakefield 2013; Wakefield 2015), and found decreased percep-
tions of quality compared to before, with findings largely pointing
to standardised packs being perceived as lower quality. Balmford
2015 (1924 participants) found a significant increase in the pro-
portion of participants who perceived that brands do not differ
in prestige (or did not know) at both the follow-up waves after
the implementation of standardised packaging; there was a signif-
icant reduction in the proportion that perceived their brand to
be of high or very high quality at both the follow-up waves after
implementation of standardised packaging compared to the wave
before implementation. Similarly, Wakefield 2015 (7175 partici-
pants), using a national sample, found significantly more smokers
reported lower satisfaction, lower quality, and lower value of their
cigarettes than a year ago, after standardised packaging had been
implemented compared to pre-standardised packaging, but not
during the transition period; they were significantly more likely to
believe packs did not differ in prestige after standardised packag-
ing compared with pre-standardised packaging, but not during the
transition period. In Wakefield 2013 (536 participants), a cross-
sectional survey, the finding that those smoking from standard-
ised packs tended towards rating their packs as less satisfying and
lower in quality compared to a year ago when smoking branded
packs was borderline significant, but there was no difference when
controlling for the proportion of the sample smoking from a stan-
dardised pack. In contrast, Miller 2015 (268 participants) found
that 69% said their cigars and cigarillos were the same quality as
“two years ago” (a period including the introduction of standard-
ised packaging), 16% lower, 15% higher; for perceived value for
money, 41% reported the same, 41% lower, and 18% higher.
Other studies
Ten remaining studies evaluated outcomes related to quality, value
and demand in adult smokers. Seven of the remaining studies
(2165 participants) found that standardised packaging was per-
ceived as having lower quality/value: including measures of qual-
ity (Gallopel-Morvan 2015a; Gallopel-Morvan 2015b; Moodie
2011; Moodie 2013), motivation to purchase/choose (Brose 2014;
Gallopel-Morvan 2015a;Gallopel-Morvan 2015b; Guillaumier
2014; Wakefield 2012); satisfaction (Gallopel-Morvan 2015a;
Gallopel-Morvan 2015b; Moodie 2011; Moodie 2013), and
perceived pleasure (Gallopel-Morvan 2015a; Gallopel-Morvan
2015b). In Gallopel-Morvan 2015a (133 participants), partici-
pants also indicated that they felt significantly more embarrassed
and would be “spreading a bad image of themselves” when using
the standardised pack than their own branded pack, and that the
branded pack was rated as having significantly more natural to-
bacco than standardised packs. Borland 2013 (160 participants)
found that among five standardised packs which differed by pack
shape and opening, the shape of the standardised pack significantly
affected perceived quality, with the rounded and bevelled pack
shapes as having the highest perceived quality of cigarette, and
the regular flip-top opening rated lower in perceived quality com-
pared with the slide opening style. Mixed findings were reported
in the remaining two studies: Maynard 2015 (128 participants)
found that smokers randomised to the standardised pack condi-
tion, compared with those randomised to the branded pack condi-
tion, reported significantly less enjoyment of smoking, but no dif-
ference in satisfaction or acceptance of smoking; those randomised
to standardised packs were significantly more likely to rate them as
cheap. In Wakefield 2008 (813 participants) quality and satisfac-
tion were rated lower for standardised packs, but there was no sig-
nificant difference in ratings across the brands for other attributes:
good value for money, exclusive/expensive brand, brand you might
try/smoke and lower class, as pack branding reduced. Three fur-
ther studies (2233 participants) evaluated outcomes related to
quality in adults in samples which included smokers and non-
smokers. All three found standardised packs to be rated as lower
quality than branded packs (Adkison 2014; Bansal-Travers 2011;
Gallopel-Morvan 2011). In addition, in Bansal-Travers 2011 par-
ticipants were more likely to say they would buy the branded pack
rather than the standardised packs if they were to choose between
the two, and in Gallopel-Morvan 2011 participants were signifi-
cantly more likely to say that a branded pack appeared to be most
expensive, and that they would be more motivated to purchase it,
compared to the standardised pack.
Four studies evaluated measures related to perceived quality/value
in people under the age of 18. In one study in non-smokers, Ford
26
T

 2013 (1025 participants) found that there was no significant dif-
ference in a composite pack receptivity (value) score between a
standardised pack and a regular flip-top branded pack; scores for
the latter were significantly lower than two novelty structural de-
sign packs (superslims and a pack with an innovative opening).
The other three studies included both smokers and non-smokers,
and found that the quality of standardised packs was perceived as
lower than branded packs. In Babineau 2015 (1378 participants),
in a pack preference task in which students were asked which
pack they would choose, just over half selected a branded pack,
34% no pack and 13% a standardised pack. Similarly, Hammond
2014 (762 participants) found that compared with branded packs,
standardised packs were significantly less likely to be selected as
the pack participants would choose. Germain 2010 (1087 partic-
ipants) found that as branding decreased, perceptions of the pack
being lower class became stronger as the packs became progres-
sively plainer; there was no significant difference in the perception
of the pack being lower class between the two standardised packs,
with 80% and 30% graphic and text warnings.
One study assessed quality in both adult and adolescent pop-
ulations. Gallopel-Morvan 2012 (540 participants) found that
a branded pack was rated significantly higher than standardised
packs for good-quality cigarettes and for motivating purchase.
There were no differences in quality ratings for the three standard-
ised packs (white, grey or brown), but the grey pack was rated
significantly higher on motivating purchase than the brown and
white packs.
Salience and recall of health warnings
Health warning salience
Nineteen studies evaluated the impact of standardised packaging
on salience of health warnings. Again, outcome measures varied
across studies, and we have tabulated results in Table 4. Findings
are briefly summarised by study population below.
Impact of standardised packaging in Australia
Sevenstudiesassessedthe impactof standardisedpackaginginAus-
tralia on health warning salience, six with adult smokers (Dunlop
2015; Miller 2015; Nagelhout 2015; Nicholson 2015; Wakefield
2015; Yong 2015), and one with youth (White 2015a). In gen-
eral, the findings pointed towards greater salience of health warn-
ings on standardised rather than branded packs. Wakefield 2015
(7175 participants), found that significantly more smokers no-
ticed warnings first when looking at the pack during the transi-
tion and post-standardised packaging periods, compared to pre-
standardised packaging, and Yong 2015 (1525 participants) found
that there was a marked increase in attentional orientation to-
wards health warnings in noticing but not in reading of warning
labels, after standardised packaging was implemented compared
to before. Nagelhout 2015 (2666 participants) found that a signif-
icantly greater proportion of smokers reported noticing, reading
and talking about health warning labels at the two post-standard-
ised packaging waves compared with the pre- wave. Dunlop 2015
(15,745 participants) found that there was a significant increase
in the proportion of smokers having strong cognitive, emotional
and avoidant responses to graphic warnings in the two to three
months after the introduction of standardised packaging, but did
not find a significant change in the proportion of smokers strongly
agreeing that the warnings were the only thing they noticed on
their packs after the introduction of the standardised packs. How-
ever, Nicholson 2015 (1643 participants) found that smokers were
similarly likely to recall noticing warning labels before and after
standardised packaging was introduced. Miller 2015 (268 partici-
pants) found that 43% of cigar or cigarillo smokers said that they
noticed warnings the same as “two years ago”, 16% less often, and
33% more often. White 2015a found that among youth who had
seen a cigarette pack in the last six months, there was no change
in the frequency of students reading, attending to, thinking or
talking about the health warnings after the introduction of stan-
dardised packaging.
Other studies
The five experimental studies in adult smokers were more mixed.
In Gallopel-Morvan 2015a and Gallopel-Morvan 2015b (total
275 participants) there were no differences in ratings of the believ-
ability or credibility of the warnings on standardised packs com-
pared to their own branded packs. In Moodie 2013 (187 par-
ticipants), warnings were rated as being read more closely, and
thought about more, on standardised packs than on their own
branded packs, but no significant difference in the overall warning
response composite scale was detected at any measurement point.
Moodie 2011 (48 participants) also found no significant difference
in the overall warning response composite scale at any measure-
ment point. Maynard 2015 (128 participants) found that smokers
randomised to a standardised pack condition were significantly
more likely to report that the health warnings were very notice-
able and more serious than smokers randomised to the branded
pack condition; however, there was no significant difference in the
believability of the health warnings or ratings of the health warn-
ings on awareness of health risks across the two conditions. The
two experimental studies in adult populations including smokers
and non-smokers did detect differences in health warning salience
between branded and standardised packs. Al Hamdani 2013 (220
participants) found that participants were significantly more likely
to recall the correct health warning on the two plainest types of
standardised packs compared with a branded pack. Bansal-Travers
2011 (397 participants) found that participants were significantly
more likely to perceive the health warning as more likely to attract
their attention on the packs with 100% health warnings (a form
27
T

 of standardised packaging) than the health warnings on branded
packs with 30% and 50% health warnings. Finally, Borland 2013
(160 participants), which investigated different pack characteris-
tics, found that shape and opening affected how distracted par-
ticipants were from the health warnings, with the regular flip-top
pack shape and opening being rated as being least distracting from
the health warnings.
Three experimental studies evaluated health warning salience in
people under the age of 18, all of which included smokers and
non-smokers. Two of these detected a significant effect of stan-
dardised packaging on health warning salience: Goldberg 1999
(401 participants) found that recall levels of two (“Smoking can
kill you” and “Cigarettes are addictive”) of three warnings were
significantly higher on the standardised pack (one was borderline
significant) than the branded pack, although recall of the third
warning (“Tobacco smoke causes fatal lung disease in non-smok-
ers”) was significantly lower for standardised than for the branded
packs; and Hammond 2014 (762 participants) found that com-
pared with branded packs, the standardised packs were signifi-
cantly more likely to be perceived as having a higher impact health
warning. In contrast, a further two studies did not detect a differ-
ence: Germain 2010 (1087 participants) found that overall 58%
of participants correctly recalled the graphic health warning and
that this did not vary by pack condition (packs becoming progres-
sively plainer).
One study, Gallopel-Morvan 2012 (540 participants), found the
health warning was rated as significantly more prominent in stan-
dardised packs than in the branded pack condition.
Perceptions of harm
Twenty-seven studies measured the impact of standardised pack-
aging on perceptions of harm, again using a diverse range of meth-
ods. Summary data from each study can be found in Table 5; as
with other sections, we briefly summarise the findings by popu-
lation group below. As explained below, perceptions of harm of
standardised packaging were related to pack colour in some studies
(see Table 5 and Characteristics of included studies for detail on
each study).
Impact of standardised packaging in Australia
Eight studies assessed the impact of standardised packaging im-
plementation in Australia on perceptions of harm, six with adults
(Balmford 2015; Miller 2015; Nicholson 2015; Wakefield 2013;
Wakefield 2015; Yong 2015), and two with youth. The findings
were mixed. Yong 2015 (1525 participants) found a significant in-
crease in reporting that the warning labels made them think about
the health risks of smoking after standardised packaging was in-
troduced compared to before; Balmford 2015 (1924 participants)
found a significant reduction in the proportion of smokers who
saidtheychose theirbrandforhealth reasonsafterthe implementa-
tion of standardised packaging compared with the wave before im-
plementation; and Wakefield 2015 (7175 participants) observed
that significantly more smokers believed that brands did not differ
in harmfulness one year post-standardised packaging compared to
pre-standardised packaging, but not during the transition period.
However, Wakefield 2015 also found no change in the perceived
harmfulness of cigarettes compared with a year ago, nor in the
belief that variants did not differ in strength, nor in believing the
dangers of smoking were exaggerated. Similarly, Nicholson 2015
(1643 participants) observed that smokers were likely to believe
smoking was dangerous to others before and after standardised
packaging was introduced. Miller 2015 (268 participants) found
that the majority of cigar and cigarillo smokers (66%) said that
they perceived the harm from their current product (standardised)
to be the same as compared to two years ago (branded), 15% re-
ported harm to be lower, and 19% reported harm to be higher.
Wakefield 2013 (536 participants), an earlier cross-sectional re-
gional survey in Australia during standardised packaging imple-
mentation, did not find any significant differences between those
smoking standardised and branded packs in thinking about the
harms of smoking or believing that the dangers of smoking have
been exaggerated. In White 2015a (7740 participants), in youth
who had seen a cigarette pack in the last six months, acknowledge-
ment of negative health effects of smoking that had been promoted
by health warnings or tobacco control advertising was high across
the two surveys, with little change over time; exceptions to this
were significant increases in the proportion agreeing that smok-
ing was a leading cause of death and caused blindness, which in-
creased over time. For new health messages introduced post-stan-
dardised packaging, awareness was high with little change for two
(gum/teeth disease and kidney disease), but increased for aware-
ness of bladder cancer. White 2015b, using data from the same
study, found that there was a significant decrease in the proportion
disagreeing with the statements that “some cigarette brands con-
tain more harmful substances than others” and“some brands are more
addictive than others” following standardised packaging; however,
there was no change over time in responses to the statement that
“some cigarette brands are easier to quit than others”.
Other studies
Experimental studies in adult smokers also offered mixed results.
In two studies, an impact was detected: in Gallopel-Morvan 2015a
(133 participants), participants were more likely to report that the
(brown) standardised pack was significantly more likely to make
them think about the dangers of tobacco than their own branded
pack; and in Gallopel-Morvan 2015b (142 participants), respon-
dents were significantly more likely to state that (brown) standard-
ised packs raised awareness of the dangers of tobacco compared
with branded packs. In contrast, the remaining four studies (1703
participants) did not detect a difference between (brown) stan-
28
T

 dardised and branded packs in perceptions of harm (Brose 2014;
Guillaumier 2014; Moodie 2011; Wakefield 2012). Mixed results
were also found from studies in samples including adult smok-
ers and non-smokers, but this can be attributed to the colour of
the standardised packaging. Adkison 2014 and Gallopel-Morvan
2011 (1836 participants) found that (brown) standardised packs
were significantly more likely to be associated with harm and dan-
ger (see Table 5 for detail). Bansal-Travers 2011 and Doxey 2011
(909 participants) found no significant differences in perceived
health risks of (white) standardised packs compared with branded
packs. Hammond 2011 (826 participants) found that branded
packs were given significantly lower ratings of harmfulness than
standardised packs (described as light brown/beige).
Five studies evaluated perceptions of harm in people under the
age of 18. In surveys and experimental studies, findings were more
consistent with standardised packs perceived as more harmful, and
again this was related to colour. In Ford 2013 (1025 participants),
the only study conducted exclusively in never-smokers, partic-
ipants rated significantly more harmful a (brown) standardised
pack than the regular branded pack; in addition the standardised
pack (which had a traditional flip-top design) was rated signifi-
cantly more harmful than three branded novelty packs (designed
with a distinctive shape, opening style or bright colour). Similarly,
Babineau 2015 (1378 participants) found that branded packs were
significantly more likely to be thought to carry less of a health
risk than (brown) standardised packs. Hammond 2013 (947 par-
ticipants) found that in an overall aggregate index score among
all 10 brands, standardised packs (cardboard-coloured) were rated
as significantly higher health risk than branded packs (aimed at
women) with descriptors, but not the same branded packs without
descriptors or branded packs aimed at men. Hammond 2014 (762
participants) found that compared with branded packs, (brown)
standardised packs with the 40% and 80% pictorial health warn-
ings were significantly less likely to be perceived as having a lower
health risk than the (brown) standardised pack with the text warn-
ings. Moodie 2012 (658 participants) found that just under half
of their participants made associations between different standard-
ised pack colours and level of harm. The red-coloured standardised
pack tended to be associated with greater harm, there was no clear
pattern with green, and the lighter colours were generally associ-
ated with reduced harm (with white the most clearly associated
with reduced harm by 18%).
Finally, three studies evaluated perceptions of harm in studies that
included youth and adults, all of which tested the impact of dif-
ferent pack characteristics; the findings were mixed. Hammond
2009 (516 participants) found variations based on colour such that
in both the white standardised pack comparisons with branded
packs, a significantly greater proportion of adult smokers perceived
the standardised pack as having lower health risks and being easier
to quit; for the brown standardised packs, for one of the com-
parisons with branded packs, a significantly greater proportion of
smokers perceived the standardised pack as having greater health
risk with no difference in ease of quitting, but there was no sig-
nificant difference for this attribute in the other comparison. The
findings with youth were mixed: with the white standardised pack
a significantly greater proportion of youth perceived it as having
lower health risks than branded packs in one out of two compar-
isons, and the brown standardised pack as greater health risks in
one out of two comparisons with branded packs. Within standard-
ised pack comparisons, packs with descriptors (such as smooth,
gold) were significantly more likely to be perceived as lower health
risks than those without, for both adult smokers and youth. In
contrast, White 2012 (640 participants) did not find a significant
difference across conditions (branded/standardised with descrip-
tors, standardised without descriptors) in health risk ratings of the
packs, even though the standardised packs were brown-coloured.
Kotnowski 2015 (448 participants) found that a lipstick-designed
pack structure, slim pack and booklet design were perceived as
significantly less harmful than the regular pack structure; there
was no evidence of a difference between (brown) standardised and
branded packaging.

Summary of main results
Standardised packaging has the potential to decrease tobacco use
prevalence through two routes: (1) reducing uptake in non-users
(typically youth, under 24 years old), and (2) reducing use in cur-
rent tobacco users (whether through cessation, relapse prevention,
or reduction in consumption).
As seen in Summary of findings for the main comparison, the one
study that assessed the impact of standardised tobacco packaging
on smoking prevalence in Australia found a 3.7% reduction in
odds when comparing before to after the packaging change, or a
0.5 percentage point drop in smoking prevalence, when adjusting
for confounders. However, certainty in this finding was graded
low, the advised starting point for observational evidence using the
GRADE system. Despite the fact that in Australia standardised
packaging was implemented concurrently with enhanced pictorial
health warnings, we did not downgrade further specifically for this
as the low GRADE takes into account the inherent difficulties
in removing possible confounding from observational evidence,
and as data on our secondary non-behavioural outcomes provides
plausible mechanisms of effect for the observed decline in preva-
lence. Evidence concerning cigarette consumption among current
smokers came from four studies which reported mixed findings:
two, including a large series of cross-sectional surveys in Australia
amongcurrentsmokersbefore, duringandafterstandardisedpack-
aging implementation, did not detect a difference in the number
of cigarettes smoked (although this study did not include smokers
who quit during the study period). Of the two small experimental
29

 studies in the UK, which involved using standardised packs for
one week and one day respectively, the first reported a small, sta-
tistically significant reduction in the mean number of cigarettes
smoked per day, and the second found no significant difference
in either the number of cigarettes smoked per day or the volume
of smoke inhaled. Certainty in the evidence is again limited. No
included studies evaluated uptake, cessation or relapse prevention.
Due to limitations in the certainty of the evidence for these pri-
mary outcomes, with only five included studies assessing these out-
comes, studies measuring related secondary outcomes can provide
further information. As stated elsewhere, standardised packaging
could work by removing the imagery/livery from tobacco packs
which is misleading, attractive or which decreases the salience of
health warnings (see How the intervention might work). By re-
moving these attributes, an important cue to tobacco use both
in smokers and non-smokers may be eliminated. Furthermore,
through removing these attributes, standardised packaging could
alter knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about tobacco use, which
could influence tobacco uptake in children and young people and
lead to tobacco reduction or cessation, or both. Studies measuring
these secondary outcomes are therefore important in assessing the
likelihood that standardised packaging will contribute to decreas-
ing tobacco use prevalence.
Studies measuring secondary outcomes were heterogeneous for
a number of important factors, including study design, popula-
tions, standardised packaging characteristics, sampling methods
and outcome measures. We were therefore unable to pool inter-
vention impact statistical estimates, and thus we adopted a nar-
rative approach. We summarise the evidence below, and whilst a
few outcomes have mixed results (e.g. for quit intentions, some
studies detected positive effects and some did not detect an effect),
most of the evidence suggests that standardised packaging affects
outcomes that could reduce smoking; none suggest that standard-
ised packaging would increase smoking.
Regarding secondary behavioural outcomes, for current smokers,
evidence from two Australian studies indicates that standardised
packaging was associated with an increase in quit attempts. One
study, assessing calls to a Quitline, also compared the impact of
standardised packaging with the introduction of graphic warnings
in Australia in 2006. The relative increase in calls was similar, but
after the introduction of standardised packaging the increase was
sustained for a longer period of time.
Several observational Australian studies also found evidence of in-
creased avoidance behaviours (such as concealing the pack) post-
standardised packaging, and these were corroborated by experi-
mental studies from the UK. Australian and UK studies found
mixed evidence of self-reported reduced smoking when using
standardised packs (through forgoing cigarettes, stubbing out
cigarettes early, smoking less around others and one examining the
volume of smoke inhaled). Studies of eye-tracking overall show in-
creased visual attention towards health warnings on standardised
compared with branded packs, and cue-related tobacco choices
were significantly lower with standardised than with branded
packs. Corroborative evidence for an impact of standardised pack-
aging on reduced smoking also came from four studies involving
pack selection, in which participants (youth and adults) believed
that they were either purchasing packs or would be sent packs;
in all these studies participants were significantly more likely to
choose the branded pack. One of the four studies was an auction,
which used an established methodology in economics for assessing
consumer behaviour; this study provides evidence that in addi-
tion to pictorial health warnings being less appealing, standardised
packaging resulted in a reduced demand for cigarettes.
Regarding secondary non-behavioural outcomes, findings on quit-
ting cognitions among smokers were mixed, whereas findings on
intention to smoke/susceptibility to smoking among youth gen-
erally pointed towards standardised packs being less likely to mo-
tivate intention to smoke. Evidence was very consistent in a wide
range of studies, including some in Australia before and after stan-
dardised packaging, that standardised packs were less appealing
than branded packs. The evidence was more mixed in relation to
the taste of tobacco, but overall pointed in the direction of tobacco
in standardised packs having a worse perceived taste than tobacco
in branded packs; colour also played a role, with tobacco in brown-
coloured standardised packs being more likely to be rated worse-
tasting than tobacco in branded or white packs. Most studies as-
sessing perceptions of quality found that tobacco in standardised
packs was judged to be of lower quality than that in branded packs.
Similarly, most studies of health warning salience indicated that
health warnings were more salient on standardised compared with
branded packs. Evidence on harm perceptions was more mixed,
particularly following implementation in Australia; in experimen-
tal studies colour was a clear factor, with tobacco in brown stan-
dardised packs being perceived as more harmful than tobacco in
branded packs and in comparison to tobacco in lighter-coloured
standardised packs. In one small experimental study, craving to
smoke was also significantly lower with standardised than with
branded packs.
In summary, there is a consistency of evidence for the impact of
standardised packaging on some outcomes. The limited evidence
we have from one study suggests that standardised packaging can
lead to decreases in smoking prevalence. There was also limited
evidence suggesting standardised packaging may increase quit at-
tempts, and mixed evidence on consumption. No studies reported
on cessation or relapse prevention. There were also no published
peer-reviewed behavioural studies on the impact of standardised
packaging on smoking uptake, the key primary outcome for non-
smokers. However, the evidence from current studies for the sec-
ondary outcomes is consistent. Standardised packaging was less
appealing to youth and adults, and, for most studies, using a va-
riety of measures, standardised packaging was associated with de-
creased intention to smoke.

 Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
We included 51 studies, all of which sought to address questions
relevant to this review and used quantitative techniques. Due to
the relativelyrecentintroductionof standardisedpackaging(which
was only complete in Australia at the time of our study search)
and the heterogeneity of the included studies, we could not pool
study results and have produced a narrative review.
Of the 51 included studies, only five contributed to our primary
outcomes. The lack of studies assessing the primary outcomes re-
flects the recency of standardised packaging legislation in Aus-
tralia. More studies are in the pipeline that will address this issue,
particularly as other countries are now implementing or will be
implementing standardised packaging.
Given the recency of standardised packaging in Australia, studies
from Australia are also limited in their length of follow-up. Indeed,
a major limitation of the current version of this review is that it is
unable to assess changes in tobacco use prevalence over a longer
time period. This is particularly important for marketing restric-
tions, which consist of the removal of branded information. Pre-
vious research suggests the effects of removing tobacco marketing
may not appear immediately upon implementation or exposure;
rather, these effects are exerted over time as brand associations
weaken (National Cancer Institute 2008). This is most apparent
in the case of youth, for whom the effects of diminished tobacco
marketing occur gradually as subsequent cohorts of youth age and
enter the period of smoking initiation without these inducements
to smoke.
When longer-term impact studies become available, we will also be
able to assess whether any immediate effects of standardised pack-
aging implementation are sustained, or whether they are short-
lived, perhaps due to the immediate contrast of standardised with
branded packs, or whether any impact may have a delayed onset.
There was a notable lack of studies evaluating cessation, uptake,
and relapse prevention; as illustrated in Figure 1, future studies as-
sessing these outcomes could bridge the gap between signals from
secondary outcomes and prevalence data.
When governments introduce standardised packaging, this pro-
vides an opportunity to refresh and enhance health warnings on
the packs, so it is likely that confounding between standardised
packaging and changes to health warnings will be a feature of other
studies in the future. Nevertheless, researchers can make efforts to
control for this in their studies, and experimental studies can com-
plement population data on the effects of standardised packaging
and graphic health warnings.
Secondarybehavioural outcomes,onthe whole, indicate how stan-
dardised packaging could reduce tobacco prevalence, increasing
our confidence in the evidence we found on our primary out-
comes.
Similarly, for the secondary non-behavioural outcomes, there was
evidence from a variety of different outcomes that standardised
packaging reduces positive attributes and therefore the appeal of
tobacco packs. These provide support for plausible mechanisms
of effect consistent with the observed decline in prevalence and
again strengthen our confidence in the findings.
In addition to studies directly comparing standardised and
branded packaging, a subset of studies also contributed data on
otherpackcharacteristics,which provide additional pointsforcon-
sideration when evaluating and implementing standardised pack-
aging. In particular, there were certain characteristics that affected
the impact of standardised packaging on our outcomes. The most
prominent was the colour of the packs. The studies consistently
indicated that tobacco packs in darker colours, compared with
lighter colours, were perceived as less appealing and more harmful,
and in some studies were associated with harsher/worse taste and
more salient health warnings. The use of descriptors on standard-
ised packs, such as ’smooth’ or ’gold’, also influenced outcomes,
compared with standardised packs where descriptors were absent.
Descriptors diminished the impact of standardised packaging. Al-
though not directly assessing standardised packaging, we also in-
cluded two studies (Borland 2013; Moodie 2012) that assessed dif-
ferent structural designs for tobacco packs (pack shape and open-
ings). These studies showed that the shape of standardised packs
significantly affected attractiveness, with innovative designs such
as rounded, bevelled and slide-packs being preferred compared to
traditionally-shaped packs with square edges and a flip-top open-
ing. This is important, because standardised packaging policies do
not always include the shape of the packs. Innovative pack shapes
were also associated with increased perceived quality; shape and
opening design also affected the salience of health warnings, with
the regular flip-top pack shape and opening rated as being least
distracting from the health warnings. Lastly, there was a clear re-
lationship between standardised packaging and health warnings,
with standardised packs with larger graphic warnings having most
impact.
Quality of the evidence
Given the inherent challenges in assessing the impact of popula-
tion-level policies such as standardised packaging, it is not surpris-
ing that a number of methodological limitations are apparent in
the studies. This is reflected in the GRADE ratings in Summary
of findings for the main comparison.
The most common limitation is the difficulty of isolating the im-
pact of standardised packaging from other packaging changes to
the warnings in studies in Australia. Studies from other countries
which had not introduced standardised packaging also suffered
from bias, predominantly due to sampling and the use of conve-
nience samples rather than representative populations.
National policies such as standardised packaging cannot be as-
sessed using randomised controlled trials, generally regarded as
the most robust design, because countries cannot be randomly as-
signed to introduce the policy or not. With observational studies,
the GRADE rating is low and studies can then be up- or down-
31

 graded depending on the extent to which they meet other criteria.
A range of studies using different designs, including longitudinal
and time series studies, are also considered robust for use when ran-
domised controlled studies are not possible, and we have included
such studies in this review. However, even with longitudinal and
times series studies, there are significant methodological challenges
to measuring the impact of individual policy measures on tobacco
use prevalence. This is particularly true in the case of standard-
ised packaging, for which the effects of a policy are likely to occur
gradually over time, as noted above. In addition, tobacco control
measures such as standardised packaging are often implemented at
the same time as other policy measures. In Australia, standardised
packaging was implemented simultaneously with enhanced pic-
torial health warnings. Isolating the impact of standardised pack-
aging from other tobacco control measures, market trends and
‘secular’ changes in smoking prevalence makes causal attributions
more uncertain. Low GRADE ratings for our primary outcomes
reflect these inherent challenges, which have also been noted in
previous reviews of tobacco marketing (Lovato 2011; US DHHS
2014). For these reasons, the legal and regulatory thresholds for
evaluating the effectiveness of marketing restrictions to date have
focused on secondary outcomes.
Some authors implemented creative designs such as randomis-
ing participants to trial the use of standardised packs in countries
where standardised packaging had not been introduced. However,
some of these studies used methods which limit their generalisabil-
ity. Instudiesof smokingbehaviours, mostusedself-reportbecause
it is difficult in large studies to validate responses. Studies have
generally shown that self-report is a reliable indicator of smoking
status (IARC 2008). Finally, for studies conducted in countries
where standardised packaging has not yet been introduced, it is
difficult to replicate a market in which all tobacco products are in
standardised packs.
Nevertheless, a major strength of this review is the wide range
of research designs and outcomes used. This includes the use of
experimental research designs with high internal validity, which
can be used to paint a more complete picture than observational
studies alone.
Potential biases in the review process
We followed standard Cochrane methods where applicable, which
are considered the gold standard. However, some element of sub-
jectivity was needed, both in terms of ’Risk of bias’ assessments
and narrative syntheses; we have been transparent about our deci-
sions throughout.
With regard to ’Risk of bias’ assessments, we adopted an approach
used in a previous review of standardised packaging to account for
a variety of study designs (Moodie 2012c).
There are a number of tools available to help authors assess risk of
bias across a range of study designs and we chose ours because of its
previously-established usefulness in assessing studies in this area.
Although we could have used other tools, and can revisit this in
the future should Cochrane tools for our range of study designs be
developed, our tool of choice allowed us to systematically identify
study limitations. Use of a different tool is unlikely to substantially
change our conclusions.
A narrative synthesis is difficult when assessing findings from such
a large number of studies and a diverse range of outcomes and
outcome measures, so some degree of simplification was necessary.
By providing tables of outcomes we hope that the level of bal-
ance between synthesis and detail that we present here is helpful
to readers, but we realise in synthesising such a large number of
diverse studies that the omission of some nuances is inevitable. We
hope, however, that this review provides a useful index and starting
point for people seeking to explore sub-questions in more depth.
In addition, we needed to make decisions about how some mea-
sures were categorised, for example the placing of craving as a non-
behavioural outcome when it is a physiological reaction (Badger
2007; Loewenstein 1996). We also categorised pack selection out-
comes as behavioural, if participants bought cigarette packs, or
believed they were to be given or sent the packs, and non-be-
havioural if they were answering hypothetically which packs they
would choose or prefer. Although it is unlikely that this classifica-
tion introduced bias, it is possible that other authors would have
classified these differently.
A further potential source of bias is that we took the decision to
exclude ’grey’ literature. Given the large volume of unpublished
data of unverified quality arising from multiple sources, we felt the
most transparent, reproducible and unbiased approach to take was
to limit our review to peer-reviewed, published studies. This was
a difficult decision to make and we recognise that this means that
some relevant unpublished data may not be included, as well as
tobacco industry research revealed through court exposure. How-
ever, given that systematic reviews need to follow transparent and
reproducible methods, and given the large volume of ’grey’ lit-
erature in this area coming from a range of sources, we felt this
was the best approach to take. The systematic inclusion of ’grey’
literature in this area is particularly challenging, given the absence
of study registers and study conduct guidelines for the range of
study types included in this review (e.g. for randomised controlled
trials, we could have searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the ISCTRN,
whereas there is no systematic way of recording all of the study
and data types relevant to this review). Where unpublished data
were available that related to published studies, we take this into
account in our main analysis. Other ’grey’ literature of particular
relevance to our primary outcomes is discussed in Agreements and
disagreements with other studies or reviews, to provide additional
context.
Lastly, the searches for this review were last run in January 2016.
We are aware of studies that have been published since this
date which may be relevant for inclusion (see Studies awaiting
classification). However, initial assessment of these studies indi-
cates that they are unlikely to have an impact on the conclusions

Reviews
Our findings are consistent with two other systematic reviews
of the evidence published in peer-reviewed journals: Stead 2013
(drawn from a published report Moodie 2012c) and Hughes 2016
(a review focusing on low- and middle-income countries or low-in-
come settings in high-income countries). These reviews also found
consistent evidence that standardised packaging reduces the appeal
of smoking,andthatstandardisedpackaging tended to increase the
salience of health warnings and, when in a darker colour, to reduce
misperceptions of differences in harm across different cigarette
packs. However, our review is the first published systematic re-
view to include behavioural outcomes following the introduction
of standardised packaging in Australia. A recent evidence review
(Hammond 2014b) reported three studies with preliminary evi-
dence of increased quit attempts and avoidance behaviours. Our
review included 12 studies which found further evidence of an
impact on quit attempts and avoidance, but also assessed smoking
prevalence, consumption, reduced smoking, quit cognitions and
intention to smoke among non-smoking youth.
Routinely collected, unpublished data from Australia
Our results showing a decline in prevalence are broadly consistent
with unpublished routine data emerging from Australia. There are
a number of sources of routine data in Australia which focus on
smoking prevalence/consumption, expenditure, the market, clear-
ance and sales data. One of these is Roy Morgan survey data,
which is discussed elsewhere in relation to the one study on preva-
lence included in this review (Diethelm 2015). Other sources and
key findings are briefly summarised here. Although these data are
not currently available in peer-reviewed, published form, they do
provide additional context, which is particularly useful given the
small number of included studies and the lack of other systematic
reviews currently evaluating our primary outcomes.
Three national repeat cross-sectional surveys in Australia found
statistically significant reductions in measures of smoking in the
period after standardised packaging was introduced. First, the Na-
tional Drug Household Survey found that daily smoking preva-
lence amongst people aged 14+ fell significantly between 2010
and 2013 (after the introduction of standardised packaging and
mostly before tobacco tax increases from Dec 1st 2013) (Australian
Institute of Health and Welfare 2014). The reduction was from
15.1% in 2010 to 12.8% in 2013, a reduction of 15% overall. De-
clines were observed in all states except Tasmania. Among young
people only, there was a slight rise in smoking amongst 12- to 17-
year-olds over the period but this was not statistically significant.
Secondly, the Australian Secondary Students Alcohol and Drug
Survey found decreasing smoking prevalence among 12- to 17-
year-olds (White 2015b). Conducted every three years, these sur-
veys demonstrated statistically significant declines in all measures
of smoking between 2008 and 2014, and also between 2011 and
2014, during the period when standardised packaging was intro-
duced. Finally, the National Health Survey of adults aged 18 and
over was conducted in 2011 - 2012 and 2014 - 2015 (Australian
Bureau of Statistics 2015). Daily smoking prevalence fell from
16.1% in 2011 - 2012 to 14.5% in 2014 - 2015.
Data are also available on expenditure, market and sales of to-
bacco in Australia, which can be viewed as indirect measures of
prevalence. Overall they show declines in the period following
the introduction of standardised packaging. The Australian Trea-
sury reports net tobacco clearances in cigarette stick equivalent
terms which includes excise and customs duty, meaning that the
effect of tobacco tax rises cannot be separated from any impact
of standardised packaging. These figures are from information re-
leased by Treasury in response to a Freedom of Information re-
quest in 2015, which contains data relating to tobacco clearances
provided by the Australian Taxation Office and Customs to Trea-
sury. Tobacco clearances fell 3.4% between the full calendar years
2012 and 2013 and a further 7.9% by 2014, a total reduction of
11% between 2012 and 2014. Household expenditure data are
reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (Australian Bureau
of Statistics 2014). Expenditure on tobacco and cigarettes fell from
AUD 4.227 billion in the September quarter of 2012, before the
introduction of standardised packaging, to AUD 3.366 billion
in the same quarter of 2015, an overall reduction of over 20%.
This was not a linear trend, with a rise in estimated consump-
tion in the June 2013 and Sept 2013 quarters. However, in all
other quarters since implementation there was a decline. Three
other sources include sales data but limited information is avail-
able. A 2014 Euromonitor report on Tobacco in Australia showed
a continued decline in sales of tobacco between 2011 and 2014
but provides limited information on sources of data or methods
(Euromonitor International 2015). Two commercial datasets (In-
foView and Aztec sales data) also exist, but although trends were
cited by industry stakeholders the underlying data are not publicly
available from either source and thus cannot be verified.
Overall, findings from these routinely-collected data support our
finding of a reduction in smoking prevalence in relation to the
introductionof standardisedpackaginginAustralia. These datasets
provide information consistent with the studies included in our
review, increasing our confidence in our results. However, they do
notattempttodetermine causality. We lookforwardtofurtherdata
being made available as standardised packaging is implemented in
other countries.

Implications for practice
The available evidence suggests that standardised packaging may
reduce smoking prevalence. Only one country had implemented
standardized packaging at the time of this review, so evidence
comes from one large observational study. A reduction in smoking
behaviour is supported by routine data collected by the Australian
government. Data on the effects of standardised packaging on
non-behavioural outcomes are clearer and provide plausible mech-
anisms of effectconsistent with the observed decline in prevalence.
In particular, there is a consistency of evidence, from a variety of
differently designed studies, and from a range of diverse outcomes,
that standardised packaging reduces the appeal of tobacco packs.
Evidence on these secondary outcomes are consistent with the reg-
ulatory objectives of standardised packaging in Australia, as well as
other countries that have implemented or are implementing stan-
dardised packaging to date (Australian Government 2016; French
Ministry of Social Affairs 2014). The available evidence suggests
that colours, descriptors, and pack shape may all affect the impact
of standardized packaging. Better understanding of the impact of
standardized packaging on tobacco uptake and cessation and of
its longer term effects is likely to come once other countries have
implemented and evaluated standardised packaging.
Implications for research
Performingrandomisedcontrolledtrialsof standardisedpackaging
for behavioural outcomes is challenging, as it is a population-level
intervention. However, observational data using established meth-
ods (e.g. interrupted time series, pre/post designs) can shed light
on the impact of standardised packaging, and the experimental
studies included in this review can provide further data to increase
understanding of the role of packaging design in smoking-related
outcomes. Guidelines on best conduct for these types of studies
are available and should be followed where possible (EPOC 2013;
IARC 2008; MRC 2011). There is a need for more studies from
Australia on uptake of tobacco use, and also the longer-term effects
of standardised packaging. As other countries implement stan-
dardised packaging, comprehensive research programmes should
be considered to assess impact on all possible outcomes. These
studies should measure and adjust for potential confounders where
possible. Studies should also take into account the colour used and
which colour is being rolled out in countries implementing stan-
dardised packaging. Further observational studies are particularly
needed to assess prevalence, consumption, cessation, uptake, and
relapse prevention.

Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]
Adkison 2014
Methods
Country: USA
Setting: Online
Date: July 2010 (one week period)
Design: within-participants experiment
Participants
USA Web survey with 1000 participants between the ages of 14 and 65 of any smoking status.
The sample was specifically designed to represent 4 age groups: 14 - 17 years (20%), 18 -
21 years (20%), 22 - 25 years (20%), and 25 - 65 years (40%). The study used a web-based
survey methodology. Participants were recruited from a panel maintained by Global Market
Insite (www.gmi-mr.com/globalpanel/ index.php), a private company that maintains global
consumer and specialty panels. Membership in their panel involves a double opt-in process
where interested parties complete an online registration form, and then activate their account
by clicking a link provided by GMI via e-mail. Average age: 31 years. 499 males (49.9%).
Ever smoked daily: 496 (49.6%), no measure of current smoking. Smokeless tobacco use in
last 30 days (1 - 5 days to 20 - 30 days): 165 (16.5%)
Interventions
IV - Participants selected the most appealing and least appealing smokeless tobacco packs
from 6 shown (Skoal Long Cut Mint, Camel Snus Frost, Marlboro Snus Peppermint, Camel
Strips Fresh, Camel Orbs Fresh, and Stonewall Wintergreen Hard Snuff). Then these prod-
ucts were presented to participants with 3 distinct packaging variations: branded vs stan-
dardised, flavour descriptors vs no descriptors, and graphic versus text warning labels (data
for the latter not relevant to this review)
Branded = 2/6 smokeless tobacco products originally shown
Standardised (plain) = Brown standardised packages
On both branded and standardised packs, this text warning was shown: “This products can
cause mouth cancer”
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: most appeal to people your age, most likely to attract your
attention, least attractive to a smoker, have the best taste, most dangerous to your health,
deliver the most dangerous chemicals, which buy if you were trying to reduce health risks,
make people think about the health risks of tobacco use, which would someone your age
most want to be seen using, which contains smokeless tobacco of better quality (branded
pack only) [author note: Participants were left to interpret their own perception of “quality”
and respond accordingly]
Analysis summary: Initially, participants were provided with a brief one-sentence descrip-
tion of how to use each product, given that many of the products may have been unfamiliar,
and were then asked to indicate which product was the most appealing and which was the
least appealing. The tobacco products selected as ‘most appealing’ and ‘least appealing’ were
thenpresentedtoparticipantswith 3distinct packaging variations. Standardised and branded
packs shown at the same time on the screen, and asked to choose standardised, branded or
no difference when asked questions. Knowledge of smokeless tobacco and perceptions of
appeal, novelty, and health risks associated with SLT pack design characteristics, were tested
using Chi2 tests of independence for each categorical variable. Multinomial regression was
employed to evaluate the association between packaging elements and participant age. These

Methods
Country: Canada
Setting: 3 Universities in Halifax Rural Municipality, Halifax, Nova Scotia
Date: not known
Design: Between-participants experimental design. 4 (branded and 3 standardised pack
levels) x 2 (smoking status: smokers and non-smokers) in which participants were randomly
assigned to view 1 package (smoking status was a non-manipulated variable)
Participants
220 adult university students (aged 19+). The accessible population consisted of adult uni-
versity students who attended 3 universities: Dalhousie University, Saint Mary’s University,
and Mount Saint Vincent University. This accessible population represents the target pop-
ulation because it includes adults who come from different socioeconomic status, cultural
backgrounds, and geographical locations in Nova Scotia. The sample was recruited through
information sheets posted around the university campuses. Interested students were asked
to read the online information letter that served as the informed consent and preceded the
image of the package and the health warning question
No average age provided but stated: 77.7% of the sample were aged 19 - 24 with the
remainder aged over 25. 100 men (45.5%). 53 smokers (24.1%); 167 non-smokers (75.9%)
Interventions
IV: branded vs 3 levels of standardised packaging
Branded = regular branded pack (Peter Jackson)
Standardised (plain) = Compared 3 levels of standardised packaging (light green colour)
to the equivalent branded pack. Plain package 1 preserved the orientation and font of the
brand and its text but removed the logo and a red line on the bottom of the package. Plain
package 2 standardised the orientation and font of the brand, and standardised and moved
the brand text to the bottom of the package. Plain package 3 standardised the brand name
and text, and placed them at the bottom of the package (30 cigarettes in standard font text)
. The packages become progressively plainer

Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: Health warning salience
Analysis summary: 7-minute survey on perceptions of the pack as a time-delay strategy,
then asked to answer a multiple-choice question to test their recall of the health warning.
A sequential binary regression analysis was conducted to look at whether standardised/
packaging and/or smoking status affected health warning recall. Preliminary analysis showed
that the demographic variables as well as smoking status did not vary significantly across
the 4 pack conditions. Therefore, none of these variables was controlled for in the logistic
regression analysis. A sequential binary logistic regression test was used to compare the odds
of choosing the correct health warning on the original pack as compared to plain packs
1, 2 and 3, and the odds of choosing the correct health warning for smokers and non-
smokers. The main effects of smoking status and pack ID were entered in the first block,
and the interaction between smoking status and pack ID was entered in the second block. A
sequential binary logistic regression test to examine whether plain packaging and/or smoking
status affects health warning recall

Setting: Secondary schools
Date: March - May 2014
Design: Within-participant experimental pen & paper survey
To measure young people’s perceptions of attractiveness, health risk and smoker charac-
teristics of tobacco packaging
Participants
1378 aged 16 - 17 year-olds. A representative sample of secondary schools (5th year of
secondary school) aged 16 - 17 from around Ireland was selected for participation. The
schools were stratified on the basis of several factors: (A) geographic location, (B) school
size, (C) type of school (boys, girls, co-ed), (D) religious affiliation (according to the
3 categories of public education in Ireland: Catholic, Church of Ireland, interdenomi-
national) and (E) socioeconomic status (schools designated ‘disadvantaged’ by the state
vs non-disadvantaged schools). After stratification according to the sampling criteria,
a total of 30 individual schools were randomly selected for inclusion. In each school,
all students in the 5th year were asked to participate in the research. After arranging a
time with the principal and participating teachers, a researcher travelled to the school
to administer the questionnaire to participating students. Average age 16.6 years. 767
male (55.7%) 602 female (43.7%) 9 self-identified ’other’. 236 smokers (17.2%); 419
ex-smokers (30.5%); 719 non-smokers (52.3%)
Interventions
IV = Brands: Silk Cut, Marboro or Benson and Hedges. Two comparisons were included
in the paper
Branded: (1) EU: Proposed packs as per the EU TPD 2014, including larger, dual-sided
text and pictorial health warnings covering 65% of the pack. Branded fonts and colours
are retained
Standardised (plain) = (2) Standardised packs with brand identifiers, including font,
colour and embossing removed, as per Ireland’s Public Health (Standardised Packaging
of Tobacco) Act 2014. Packs are of a brown matte colour and contain dual-sided text
and pictorial warnings covering 65% of the pack
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: (1) attractiveness (“which, if either, of the cigarette packs
do you think is more attractive”); (2) health risk (“which, if either, of the cigarettes do
you think carries less of a health risk”) and (3) attributes of a typical smoker (“which,
if either, of the cigarettes do you think is typically smoked by someone who is popular
or well-liked”). Pack preference task: All students were provided with a pack preference
question, where they were presented with 6 pack images and an option of ‘No Pack/
None of the Above’ on one page. For each brand of cigarette included in the study,
a branded and a standardised pack were presented. They were then asked, “Given the
choice between these packs, which one would you choose?”
Analysis summary: Each page contained 1 pair of packs featuring the same brand,
but a different level of standardisation - i.e. 2 packs, one of which portrayed EU TPD
guidelines and one portraying Irish standardised packaging guidelines. Asked to select a
preferred pack for a series of outcome questions. Comparisons were conducted between
all levels of standardisation for each brand, but not between brands. For the brand pref-
erence question, a variable was then created to indicate if the student chose a branded
pack, a standardised pack, or no pack; Chi2 test to compare probability ppts selected EU
or standardised pack for each outcome variable GEE regression models with exchange-
able correlation matrices were conducted to explore the impact of demographic and

smoking-related factors on individuals’ perceptions of packaging. GEE binary logistic
models conducted to explore factors related to pack preference with cases with missing
data omitted. Individual regressions run for each brand for each of the 3 outcomes. 4
covariates included: gender, school-level SES, country of birth and personal tobacco use
(age omitted because of narrow age band). Interaction effects for all included variables
also explored and entered into an additional model. Pack preference analysed through a
binary variable

Methods
Country: Australia
Setting: Respondents completed a survey via computer-assisted telephone interview in
earlier waves (beginning in 2002) and a mix of phone interview and web-based survey
in the 2 recent waves selected for this study
Date: October 2011 - December 2014 (3 waves of data) - Specifically: October 2011 -
February 2012 (pre-SP) (n = 1104), February - May 2013 (post-SP1) (n = 1093) and
August - December 2014 (post-SP2) (n = 1090)
Design: Pre-post standardised packaging study: longitudinal cohort study assessing a
population-based public health plain packaging intervention
Participants
Representative cohort of adult (aged 18+) smokers (smoked in last 30 days). All partic-
ipants prior to the post-SP wave were recruited by phone via a stratified random-digit
dialling frame, but new participants at the post-SP wave were recruited by phone from
a single source probability-based panel via an address-based frame
Pre: 1104; Post (year 1): 1093; Post (year 2): n = 1090; TOTAL: 1924. Average age 51.5
years. 890 men (46.3%) Smokers 1924 (Pre-SP: 1104 (100%) Post-SP1: 1093 (100%)
Post-SP2: 1090 (100%)
Interventions
IV = pre- and post-standardised packaging in Australia
Branded = Real Australian brands on the market pre-standardised packaging
Standardised (plain) = Current Australian plain packages that came into effect December
1st 2012: dark brown-green colour (Pantone 448C), with the brand name in the same
typeface (Lucida Sans) and font size and colour (Pantone Cool Gray 2C). 75% pictorial
health warning on front, 90% back
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: determinants of brand choice including: ‘Was part of
your decision to smoke your current brand based on whether it may not be as bad for your
health’ (1 of 3 options). Brand appeal: quality, prestige, perceptions of the appearance of
one’s pack
Analysis summary: The raw data were converted to Australian population estimates,
with sampling weights calibrated to smoking prevalence by sex and age within each
state and territory based on 2011 census and 2013 National Drug Survey data. Change
over time (from pre- to post-SP1 and post-SP2) in brand awareness and identification
along with other brand-related measures was analysed using GEE by testing for a main
effect of survey wave while controlling for potential confounders: demographics (age,

(internet or telephone). As the dependent variables were all treated as binary for the
purpose of analysis, used binomial distribution and logit link function for the models.
Assumed a working correlation structure which was unstructured given the large sample
and used robust variance to compute the P values for the parameter estimates [11].
Overall, 1924 respondents provided at least one data point across the 3 survey waves
(1000 with 1 data point, 496 with 2 data points and 428 with 3 data points), giving a
total of 3276 person-wave observations for the GEE analysis. GEE models were also used
to explore correlates of brand awareness and identification and whether they differed
between pre-SP and post-SP by testing for interactions by survey waves

Quote: “Standardised packaging (SP) of to-
bacco products, introduced in Australia in
December 2012, has the potential to dis-

ments. First, plain packaging, which is de-
signed to reduce the attractiveness and ap-
peal of tobacco, increases the noticeability
and effectiveness of health warnings, and
reduce the ability of packaging to mislead
consumers about smoking harms [4]. Sec-
ond, it involves new larger graphic health
warnings on the front face of the pack,
designed to further highlight the health
harms, but which also are likely to distract
further from the branding of the pack.”

Methods
Country: USA
Setting: Shopping mall (largest and most central mall in Buffalo) in Buffalo, New York
Date: June - July 2009
Design: Mall intercept survey
Participants
397 adults (18+ US residents). Using a table in the mall staffed with at least 2 interview-
ers. The location of the table varied by day depending on space availability. People who
approached the table were asked if they would like to participate. Average age 34 years. 203
men (51%); 194 women (49%). 197 smokers (49.6%); 200 non-smokers (50.4%)
Interventions
IV branded versus standardised packaging
Standardised: white standardised pack with no health warning (Mayfair)
Branded: Branded Mayfair with no health warning
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: Most tar, smoothest taste, which buy, which buy if trying to
reduce health risks, more attractive, appeal to youth < 18 years, contains cigarettes of better
quality, appeal to youth aged < 18 years
Analysis summary: After completing a baseline survey, participants were asked to view a
series of cigarette packages, one set at a time. Participants were allowed to pick up and review
the packs if they wanted and then were asked 4 - 8 questions about each set. Interviewer read
and filled out the form. Participants were encouraged to select one of the packages in the set
as a response for each question. Chi2 statistics were used to test for signif cant differences
in pack selections. In order to examine how different pack selections might be influenced by
a person’s smoking status and type of cigarette smoked (among current smokers), a series of
logistic regression analyses were performed. For these analyses, the main outcome variables
were the different pack selections, and the independent variables were either smoking status
(smoker or non-smoker) or type of cigarette smoked (“light/mild” vs full flavour) among
current smokers. The analyses were adjusted for the following variables (categoric): age in
years (18 - 24, 25 - 34, 35 - 44, 45 - 54, 55 - 64, 65+); gender (male, female); race/ethnicity
(white, non-Hispanic; black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; Other, non-Hispanic); and education
level (12 years or less; greater than 12 years); and for the smoker-only analysis, cigarettes per
day (0 - 10, 11 - 20, 21+). Where 3 packs were presented for selection as the dependent
variable (size, attribution), multinomial logistic regression was used. Regression models were
conducted to test if the adjusted models differed from what is presented;

Participants
160 young Australian adult (aged 18 - 29) ever-smokers (smokers and recent quitters).
The survey was conducted on the internet by a registered market research company (the
Social Research Centre). Respondents were drawn from a national panel of previously
identified smokers from the company’s database. Participating respondents were awarded
credits as part of a redemption scheme devised by the market research company
80 men (50%) 80% (129) smokers; 32 (20%) non-smokers; 33 ex-smokers (20.6%).
Median age 25 years
Interventions
Not about standardised packaging (as all packs were standardised), but pack structure
(shapes and openings)
The 5 pack shapes were: 1. standard pack (7 - 6 - 7 organisation of the cigarettes); 2.
wider and thinner shape (2x10 pack); 3. squarer and fatter shape (4x5 pack); 4. bevelled-
edged; and 5. rounded pack shape (both of the last 2 had the same basic shape as the
standard pack)
The 5 pack openings were: 1. standard flip-top; 2. flip opening from the base (Rotate);
3. slide-out mechanism (Slide); 4. case opening; and 5. side opening flip-top (Side-Flip)
, sometimes called a Lighter pack
All packs were standardised: Beige (cardboard) coloured with standard font for the brand,
the descriptor name (e.g. Fine) and the number of cigarettes. The study used a 10-point
font
Standardised pack would be 1 in each of the variations above, i.e. the standard flip-top
pack. Other shapes and openings would be viewed as non-standardised for the purposes
of this study
HW: 30% front and back, 70% front and back but only image of front shown. All
packs used the same graphic health warning on the face of the pack (‘Smoking causes
peripheral vascular disease’), with the current picture redesigned for the 70% warnings
The colour, font and HW size were different from those subsequently implemented in
Australia
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: 1) perceived attractiveness; 2) quality of the cigarettes
contained; 3) distraction from the health warning on the pack (rankings were from 1
(least) to 5 (most) on each characteristic); 4) which pack shape they preferred most and
least
Analysis summary: Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test for mean
differences between pack shapes/openings and to identify interactions with brand or
health warnings. They used Spearman’s r for correlations. Post hoc tests used Bonferroni
corrections for multiple comparisons. They used a significance level of 0.05 throughout
but note that within-participant power to find effects was greater than for the between-
participants effects. Overall means for pack preferences were calculated where ratings
were only of most and least by scoring 5 points for each most preferred, 1 point for least
preferred and scoring all other cases 3 points

Methods
Country: Australia
Setting: National Tobacco Plain Packaging Tracking Survey, Australia. Dual-frame ran-
dom digit dialling telephone surveys with approx 100 surveyed per week
Date: December 2012 - November 2013
Design: Observational cohort survey - continous cross-sectional surveys with follow-ups
carried out one month later. (Both baseline and follow-up surveys had to be completed
during the first year of implementation of the packaging changes (prior to implemen-
tation of the 12.5% tax increase for tobacco products that occurred in Australia on 1
December 2013)
Participants
Australian adult cigarette smokers aged 18 - 69 (Note: the sample was restricted to current
smokers of factory-made or roll-your-own cigarettes; currently smoked daily or weekly,
or smoked monthly or less-than-monthly but self-identified as a smoker rather than as
an ex-smoker)
Continuing cigarette smokers at follow-up: 2948 (*Sample used in analyses predicting
daily thoughts about quitting, intentions to quit in next month, firm date to quit in
next month, pack concealment, stubbing out and stopping oneself from smoking); 54.
7% men (n = 1612); 45.3% women (n = 1335)
Baseline cigarette smokers at follow-up: N = 3125 (Sample used in analyses predicting
attempts to quit in past month) 55.1% men (n = 1594) 44.9% women (n = 1403)
Age not available
The average age of the sample (n = 5441) 45.2 years. Across each stage of standardised
packaging, the average age of the sample: Pre (n = 1423) 50.3 years; Early transition (n
= 276) 47.6 years; Late transition (n = 617) 45.6 years;
Post-year 1 (n = 3125) 42.7 years

2948; n (unweighted) = 2907) were used in models predicting all outcomes except for
quit attempts. 2. Cigarette smokers at baseline who completed the follow-up survey
(‘baseline cigarette smokers’; n (weighted) = 3125; n (unweighted) = 3081 were used
in models predicting the likelihood that smokers had attempted to quit in the month
between the baseline and follow-up surveys. The baseline sample was weighted using a
design weight and a post-stratification weight, accounting for telephony status (landline
or mobile), gender, age by education, and state of residence. The follow-up sample
was weighted using a longitudinal weight, derived from an adjustment to the baseline
weighting variable, which accounted for each participant’s probability of being retained
in the follow-up sample
A series of initial logistic regression models was conducted to examine the association
between each predictor and each outcome (i.e. 1 model per predictor/outcome). When
more than 1 significant predictor (at P < 0.05) of an outcome was identified, a multivari-
able model was conducted that included all predictors associated with the outcome at P
< 0.05, so as to identify the strongest independent predictors. Initial and multivariable
models were conducted that were unadjusted and adjusted for the covariates described
above as well as the date of the follow-up survey and the number of days between surveys
Unadjusted and adjusted models controlled for the baseline level of the outcome variable.
Conducted 2 sets of sensitivity testing: 1. To examine the possibility that associations
between the predictors and the outcomes were influenced by the anticipation of the 12.
5% tax increase on 1 December 2013 rather than the packaging changes, all adjusted
analyses were repeated excluding respondents who were followed up in November 2013;
2. Previous research has indicated that interest in quitting tends to be lower in the
last 3 weeks of December and higher in the first 2 weeks of January, so repeated all
adjusted analyses including an indicator variable to capture the January seasonality effect.
Adjusted for the effects of sample weighting on parameter estimates and SEs. In addition,
unconditional approach used to limit the sample as appropriate for each set of analyses,
ensuring correct estimation of the SEs. Cases that had missing data on outcome variables,
the baseline versions of these variables and predictor variables (typically < 5% combined)
were deleted listwise from each model

Methods
Country: UK
Setting: University research laboratory/study centre (University College London)
Date: Oct - Dec 2012
Design: Between-participants experimental design
Participants
98 smokers over the age of 18 and abstained from smoking for at least 12 hours be-
fore their scheduled study participation. Recruited through University College London’s
Psychology online participant pool, open to students and also members of the public.
Average age 23.3 years. 36 men (36.7%)
Interventions
IV: Participants were randomised into 3 groups - preferred branded pack, non-preferred
branded pack or standardised pack group
Branded = 1) Participant’s preferred branded pack (they brought their own packs); and
2) Non-preferred (other) branded pack (1 of 2 regular branded cigarette packs was used)
. N.B. A non-preferred branded pack was included to assess whether any cue reactivity
could be reduced using any pack different from the ones participants most strongly
associated with smoking and to see if any favourable evaluation of branded packs was
linked specifically to the preferred brand
Standardised (plain) = Modelled on Australian standardised packaging (without brand or
variant name): dark brown-green colour as those used in Australia (Pantone 448C), with
the brand name in the same typeface (Lucida Sans) and font size and colour (Pantone
Cool Gray 2C). 75% pictorial HW on both sides
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: craving and motivation to stop
Analysis summary: Participants completed a baseline questionnaire before undertaking
the exposure task during which they were presented with a closed cigarette packet and
asked to describe each side of the packet in detail for 1 min to ensure engagement with
the design of the packs and the health warnings on them, so that the differences in
pack design and prominence of health warnings could affect craving and evaluation of
packaging. Following the exposure task, participants completed a second questionnaire
and were debriefed using a standardised script
One-wayANOVAS andChi2 statisticswere usedtocompare baseline characteristicacross
the 3 groups. Sensitivity analyses adjusted for age and gender and frequency of smoking.
Mixed-model 3x2 ANCOVAs with packaging type as between-participants variable and
time point of measurement (baseline to post-exposure) of craving or motivation to stop
as within-participant variable were used to assess the effect of packaging type on craving
and motivation to stop smoking. Significant findings were followed up by one-way
ANCOVAs followed with Sidak-adjusted pairwise comparisons of the change in craving
or motivation from baseline to post-exposure in the 3 groups. Participants’ perceptions of
the pack, smokers using it and effectiveness of the pack to affect behaviour were entered
into a one-way MANCOVA and, following a significant result, perceptions across the 3
groups were compared in individual one-way ANCOVAs followed with Sidak-adjusted
pairwise comparisons

Country: China
Setting: ’Lab’ experiment conducted with Chinese non-smoking students in Macau
Date: unknown
Design:Between-participants experiment with a 2 (label type: existing vs plain packaging) ×
2 (brand familiarity: familiar vs unfamiliar brand) factorial design to investigate the effects
of this new cigarette labelling format on smoking intent and brand likability among young
people
Participants
The sample comprised 116 non-smoking students aged 18 - 22, 58 percent of them women,
studying on the same programme and course at a university in Macau
Part of a course curriculum in classroom in a university in China (took place during their
normal lectures)
18 - 22 years, average age unknown
42% (n = 49) men, 58% (n = 67) women 100% non-smokers
Interventions
IV: 2x2 factorial design (packaging and brand familiarity)
Branded: Among the 2 treatment conditions that showed the existing packaging, 1 was with
a familiar brand “Marlboro” which accounted for more than 50% market share and the
other was with an unfamiliar brand “Taipan” which accounted for only a minimal market
share and a limited distribution. 50/50 split between the brand message and government
message, with the government message in the text-plus-graphic format
Standardised: Familiar brand Marlboro vs unfamiliar brand Taipan both on standardised
packaging

Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: smoking intent and the brand’s likability. Brand likability
was assessed with a single statement concerning how much they disliked the brand as a result
of the packaging: This packaging makes you dislike the cigarette brand. Smoking intent was
measured by the participating students’ responses to 3 statements ranked on a 9-point Likert
scale
Analysis summary: A lab experiment with a 2 (label: existing versus plain packaging format)
× 2 (brand familiarity: familiar vs unfamiliar brand) factorial design. During their normal
lectures, students in the different treatment cells were first presented with pictures showing
different cigarette-pack labelling designs, and then instructed to complete a questionnaire
measuring their smoking intent and the brand’s likability. The 4 treatments (i.e. 2×2 different
cigarette packs) were randomly assigned to students. Survey completed immediately after
experiment. Label type is the predictor and ’brand familiarity’ is being used as a mediator

Methods
Country: Australia
Setting: Roy Morgan Research’s Single Source survey. Nationally representative of Australia.
Door-to-door using CAPI (computerised assisted interviews)
Date: January 2001 - December 2013
Design: Observational. Continuous cross-sectional surveys. 156 months, monthly observa-
tions were computed from weekly surveys by the previous authors (Kaul and Wolf) of the
working paper from which these data were extracted. Data analysed up until approximately
1 year afer the implementation of standardised packaging
Participants
Roy Morgan Research’s Single Source using random sampling methods.The total sample size
over the period was approx 700,000; the average annual sample size was approx 54,200, with
4500 sample size per month. The composition of the sample changes each month (hence
age, gender N/A)
Interventions
IV: Plain packaging vs branded packaging (roll-your-own and factory-made)
Branded = prior to standardised packaging introduction
Standardised (plain) = dark brown-green colour (Pantone 448C), with the brand name in
the same typeface (Lucida Sans) and font size and colour (Pantone Cool Gray 2C). 75%
pictorial HW on front; 90% back
Outcomes
[Primary]: Prevalence of tobacco smoking among adults over 156 months comparing pre-
and post-standardised packaging law
Analysis summary: Stepwise (forward selection, backward elimination, both) logistic regres-
sion using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to determine the final model. Also fitted
a Loess non-parametric trend, in the same way as Kaul and Wolf did in their paper, using
R’s loess function with the same default parameters. Analysis is adjusted, for the following
policies: graphic health warnings, smoke-free policies, and tax increases on tobacco products

or not-for-profit sectors.”
Conflicts of interest
“The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.”
Notes
For each month the percentage of smokers and size of the sample from the published figures
were estimated and the number of smokers and non-smokers in each sample was recon-
structed. Additional data were provided by authors upon request. This paper investigated
the findings of an unpublished industry-funded paper (Kaul 2014). An upublished report
for the Australian government also relies on the same data set (Chipty 2016)

Quote: “Together with the time variable
(ranging from 1 to 156), we have included
in the analysis the four indicator variables
described above: Comprehensive smoke-free
policy (smoke. free); graphic health warnings
(ghw); 25% tax increase (tax); plain packag-
ing (pp).” “Another factor which may have
also induced a decrease in smoking preva-
lence is the enlarged and enhanced health
warnings, “which appeared on cigarette packs
conjointly with the requirement for stan-
dardized packaging. It is however difficult to
completely separate these two measures from
each other as the larger health warnings are
an integral part of the new pack design.”
Comment: Enhanced pictorial warnings
were implemented at the same time as stan-

the effects. Hence confounding rated high
even though other policies implemented that
could have led to changes in smoking preva-

Methods
Country: Canada
Setting: web-based
Date: May - June 2009
Design: Between-participants design with 4 different pack conditions. Randomised (af-
ter assessing smoking status) to view 8 cigarette packs designed according to 1 of 4 exper-
imental conditions: fully-branded female brands; the same brands without descriptors
(eg, ‘slims’); the same brands without brand imagery or descriptors (i.e. ‘standardised’
packs); and fully branded non-female brands as a control condition
Participants
512 women aged 18 - 25 in Canada, smokers and non-smokers
Participants were recruited from a consumer panel of over 400,000 Canadians through
Global Market Insite Inc. (GMI, Bellevue, Washington). Invitations to participate in the
survey were emailed to select panel members, although the invitation did not indicate
the nature. Participants complete a 20-min survey by email
50% smokers/former smokers and 50% never-smokers were randomised to each of the
4 conditions
Average age 22 years. 212 (41%) smokers; 39 ex-smokers (7.6%); 261 (51%) non-
smokers
Interventions
IV: 3 branded packs and standardised pack comparisons
Branded = Condition 1: Branded female packs; Condition 2: Branded female packs with
no descriptors; Condition 4: Non-female branded packs
Standardised = Condition 3: White standardised packs with brand names of real female
brands (no variant/descriptor); All packages in the study displayed the same pictorial
health warning covering 50% of the principal display surface, in accordance with Cana-
dian regulations
The 8 ‘female-oriented’ brands were selected based on previous research and internal
industry documents. These brands featured the descriptors extra slims, slims, menthol,
cherry and vanilla, as well as ‘traditional’ female colour schemes, such as pink, white and
other pastels. The ‘non-female’ brands selected for condition 4 included popular ‘full
flavour’ or ‘regular’ variants of Canadian cigarette brands
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: perceived appeal, taste, tar delivery, health risks and
smokers’ traits. For the first 4, responses were provided on a 5-point Likert scale (e.g. 1
= ‘a lot more appealing’ to 5 = ‘a lot less appealing’) and subsequently coded as either a
1 (‘a little’/‘a lot more appealing’) or 0 (‘a little’/‘a lot less appealing’ and ‘no difference’).
An overall index rating was created for each of the 4 measures, by summing scores across
the 8 packages to yield a score between 0 and 8. For the smokers’ traits, for each package,
respondents were asked to identify the typical smoker of each pack by answering the
question ‘In your opinion, someone who chooses to smoke this brand is more likely to
be’ for 8 characteristics: female/male, glamorous/not glamorous, cool/not cool, exciting/
boring, popular/not popular, attractive/unattractive, slim/overweight, sophisticated/not
sophisticated. For each set of traits, respondents could choose either trait, ‘don’t know’,
or ‘no difference. The most desirable trait was scored a 1 and the less desirable trait, no
difference and don’t know were scored a 0. Female was scored a 1 and male, no difference
and don’t know were scored a 0
Analysis summary: Regression models were used to examine the effect of experimental
condition for 3 primary outcomes: brand ratings, smoker trait ratings and beliefs about
smoking. For each outcome, regression models were conducted in 2 steps. In step 1, only

smoker traits. Unless indicated otherwise, results are from the ‘adjusted’ models in step
2 with all covariates present

per week
Date:April 2006 - May 2013
Design: Observational continuous cross-sectional study with interrupted time-series
analyses until 5 months after compulsory standardised packaging implementaiton
Participants
15,745 New South Wales, Australian adult cigarette smokers (aged 18+). Households are
recruited using random-digit dialling (landline telephone numbers only) and a random
selection procedure is used to recruit participants within households (selecting the nth
oldest eligible adult)

characteristics. Assessed impact of the introduction of the new packs on (1) the propor-
tion of the sample strongly agreeing with each of the GHW statements, (2) the mean
GHW Impact score, (3) the proportion of the sample strongly disagreeing with each of
the pack perception statements and (4) the mean Negative Pack Perception score. Used
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) analysis to model effects of introduc-
tion of the new packaging on the outcomes of interest, while accounting for background
trends, seasonal variation, the effects of television anti-tobacco advertising, and changes
in cigarette price. ARIMA modelling chosen as data for each of the outcomes of interest
were auto-correlated. Next, multiple linear regression analyses was use to assess changes
in scores on the GHW Impact and Negative Pack Perception scales, using month of
interview as the indicator, focusing on the period of the introduction of the new packs.
The months preceding and following the intervention were represented by a 5-level term:
(1) the 2 months preceding the change (August - September, ‘pre-standardised packs’)
; (2) the 2 months of ‘phase-in’ (October - November); (3) the 2 months ‘immediate
post-standardised packaging’ (December - January); (4) ‘3 - 4 months post-standardised
packaging’ (February - March); and (5) ‘5 - 6 months post-standardised packaging’ (April
- May). Outcomes: Salience of tobacco pack health warnings, cognitive and emotional
responses to warnings, avoidance of warnings, perceptions regarding one’s cigarette pack.
Responses to these items were used in 2 ways. The first was collapsing responses for
each item into a binary variable indicating strong agreement versus not. The second
was averaging the responses to these items to create a scale indicating ‘Graphic Health
Warning Impact’, with higher scores indicating greater overall impact Outcomes (Out-
comes: Salience of tobacco pack health warnings, cognitive and emotional responses to
warnings, avoidance of warnings, perceptions regarding one’s cigarette pack.)

Design: Observational. Cohort surveys. A series of 4 cohorts of Australian adult cigarette
smokers originally sourced from a nationally representative cross-sectional tracking sur-
vey probability sample. Followed up 1 month after the baseline interview. The 4 cohorts
each completed 2 surveys 1 month apart (follow-up period was 1 month). Timings of
each participant’s baseline and follow-up differed slightly (see details below). The pre-
standardised packaging phase included those who completed both baseline (10 April -
1 September 2012) and follow-up surveys (7 May 2012 - 30 September 2012) prior to
implementation of the packaging changes. The early transition/implementation phase
included those surveyed at baseline in the pre-packaging changes period (20 August -
28 September 2012) and followed-up during the transition to the new packaging (1
October - 11 November 2012). The late transition phase included those first surveyed
during the transition to the new packaging (1 October - 30 November 2012) and fol-
lowed-up either during the transition or soon after the full implementation of the new
packaging (29 October 2012 - 20 January 2013). The 1-year post phase included those
who completed both surveys in the first year of full implementation of the new packaging
(baseline surveys: 1 December 2012 - 4 November 2013; follow-up surveys: 2 January
2013 - 30 November 2013)
Participants
5441 Australian adult (aged 18 - 69 years) current cigarette smokers of factory-made or
roll-your-own cigarettes Respondents come from a nationally representative cross-sec-
tional tracking survey (continuous cross-sectional telephone baseline survey). Telephone
interviews were conducted using a dual-frame sample design, with half of baseline par-
ticipants recruited via landline random digit dialling (RDD) and half by mobile phone

Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: Substantial research has demonstrated that thoughts
aboutquittingandquitintentionsprospectivelypredictmaking quitattempts. Frequency
of thoughts about quitting was assessed by asking ‘During the past week, how often
have you thought about quitting?’ with response options: ‘several times a day’; ‘once a
day’; ‘once every few days’; ‘once’; or ‘not at all’. Consistent with previous research which
found daily thoughts of quitting increased with antismoking advertising, responses were
dichotomised into those who had thought about quitting at least once a day in the
past week versus those who had thought about quitting less often. Quit intentions were
measured using 2 questions: ‘Do you intend to quit in the next month?’ and ‘Have you
set a firm date to quit in the next month?’
Analysis summary: Proportions of those reporting quitting-related cognitions and be-
haviours in the follow-up survey compared across 4 distinct phases. Each individual’s
baseline level of each outcome variable was included as a predictor of that particular out-
come variable at follow-up, which enabled the use of the phase variable as a predictor of
the variance in follow-up quitting cognitions and behaviour that remained unexplained
by an individual’s baseline levels - the phase variable acted as a predictor of the difference
in an individual’s quitting cognitions and behaviours between the baseline and follow-up
surveys (approximately 1 month apart). In all logistic regression analyses, the pre- phase
was used as the referent category. Conducted models that were unadjusted and adjusted
for covariates. Preliminary logistic regression analyses (unadjusted and adjusted) were
first conducted to examine if there were any differences between phases on the baseline
levels of each outcome variable. In analyses examining whether phase was associated with
quit attempts at follow-up, used the recency of previous quit attempts at baseline as the
baseline level of the outcome variable. Used 5 categories indicating whether smokers had
never previously tried to quit, had tried to quit more than 12 months ago, had tried to
quit between 6 and 12 months ago, had tried to quit 2 - 6 months ago or had tried to quit
within the past month. Additionally, conducted sensitivity testing to explore effects (in
adjusted models) with and without inclusion of data collected in November 2013, the
month prior to the tax increase on 1 December 2013. Also repeated all adjusted analyses
including 2 indicator variables to capture seasonality effects. All analyses were conducted
adjusting for the effects of sample weighting on parameter estimates and SEs. In addi-
tion, the ‘subpopulation’ command in Stata was used to limit the sample as appropriate
for each set of analyses, ensuring correct estimation of the SEs. All reported adjusted
proportions and ORs were adjusted for age, sex, education, socioeconomic status, HSI,
antismoking advertising activity, change in cigarette price, number of days between the
baseline and follow-up surveys and date of follow-up survey

Methods
Country: UK
Setting: In-home survey in the UK (wave 6 of the Youth Tobacco Policy Survey (YTPS)
). The YTPS is a long-running, repeat cross-sectional study examining the impact of
tobacco policies on young people
Date: July - September 2011
Design: cross-sectional survey
Participants
FACTS International, a market research company, recruited participants and conducted
the survey. Random location quota sampling was used to generate a sample of 11 -
16-year-olds from households across the UK. Sampling involved a random selection
of 92 electoral wards, stratified by Government Office Region and A Classification Of
Residential Neighbourhoods (ACORN) classification (a geodemographic classification
system that describes demographic and lifestyle profiles of small demographic areas)
to ensure coverage of a range of geographic areas and sociodemographic backgrounds.
Wards covering the islands, areas north of the Caledonian Canal, or those with fewer
than 3 urban/suburban Enumeration Districts, were excluded from the sampling frame
for cost and practicality reasons. In each selected ward, a quota sample, balanced across
gender and age groups, was obtained
1025 youth aged 11 - 16 who have never smoked. The fieldwork comprised in-home
face-to-face interviews, accompanied by a self-completion questionnaire to gather more
sensitive information on smoking behaviour
51.5% (n = 528) males
Interventions
IV: To compare adolescents’ responses to 3 different styles of cigarette packaging: novelty
(branded packs designed with a distinctive shape, opening style or bright colour), regular
(branded pack with no special design features) and standardised (brown pack with a
standard shape and opening and all branding removed, aside from brand name). Brand

names were concealed in an attempt to reduce prior brand knowledge informing pack
ratings. Fronts of packs only shown. Participants viewed a single image of all 5 packs
Branded = Pack A (Mayfair), a popular and familiar brand, represented an everyday pack
without any notable design features, other than the blue colour. It therefore provided
the potential for use as a benchmark ‘regular’ pack against which other packs could be
compared;
3 packs (packs B, C,D) were selected to represent a range of ‘novelty’ packs. Pack B (Silk
Cut Superslims) was an innovative, smaller and slimmer than usual pack shape with
elegant and feminine aspects. Pack C (Marlboro Bright Leaf) provided an example of
innovative opening, resembling a flip-top cigarette lighter, more masculine features and
dark colouring. Pack D (Pall Mall) represented a classic pack style but with a striking
and unique bright pink colour (not relevant to this review so not mentiond in text of
the review)
Standardised (plain) = Pack E (a plain brown pack) represented a pack that was void of
all design features
Health warning: text message ‘Smoking seriously harms you and others around you’ 30%
UK text warning on front on all packs
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: 11 items assessed young people’s responses to packaging
across the 5 different pack designs. Participants were asked: ‘Can you tell me the number
that best describes each pack?’ and were assessed via scales: (1) Attractive/ unattractive; (2)
Eye-catching/not eye-catching; (3) Cool/not cool; (4) Not at all harmful/very harmful;
(5) Fun/boring; (6) Worth looking at/not worth looking at; (7) Meant for someone like
me/not meant for someone like me; (8) Grown-up/childish; (9) Puts me off smoking/
tempts me to smoke; (10) I dislike this pack/I like this pack; and (11) I would not like
to have this pack/I would like to have this pack. Responses were provided on 5-point
semantic scales (e.g. 1 = ‘Attractive’ to 5 = ‘Unattractive’). Prior to analysis, items (1 -
7) were reverse coded to make a low score (1) indicative of a negative rating and a high
score (5) indicative of a positive pack rating
Analysis plan: Participants viewed 1 image, which displayed all 5 cigarette packs, and
were asked to rate each pack on 11 items. Paired t-tests were used to produce mean scores
of the 11 items for: (1) the ‘traditional’ pack (Mayfair) relative to the mean scores for
each of the 3 ‘novelty’ packs (Silk Cut Superslims, Marlboro Bright Leaf and Pall Mall)
and (2) the standardised pack relative to the mean scores of each of the other 4 packs.
The authors then combined these 11 measures into 2 separate variables using principal
components analysis: (1) PACK APPRAISAL: 5 items combined to form a composite
pack appraisal measure: (i) Unattractive/attractive; (ii) Not eye-catching/eye-catching;
(iii) Not cool/cool; (iv) Boring/fun; (v) Not worth looking at/worth looking at and (2)
PACK RECEPTIVITY: (6) Not meant for someone like me/meant for someone like
me; (7) Puts me off smoking/tempts me to smoke; (8) I dislike this pack/I like this pack;
(9) I would not like to have this pack/I would like to have this pack. In the analyses,
the authors presented unajusted analyses for all individual items, but adjusted for the 2
composite variables

[Secondary non-behavioural]: appeal, awareness of smoking dangers, reported to facilitate
intentions to reduce consumption, to quit, or not to start among non-smokers
Analysis summary:
Showed 1 pack and then the other and asked them to rate the pack. Showed physical packs.
Ratings on the standardised pack vs branded pack were compared with Chi2 tests. Responses
were also analysed taking into account smoking status, sex, and respondent age, a logistic
binary regression was used. Used a Chi2 test (table 2) and binary logistic regression (table 3)
.
Second publication
[Secondary non-behavioural]: For each brand, respondents were asked which pack (regular,
limited edition, plain or none) was (1) most effective in getting attention, (2) most attractive,
(3) most effective in convincing non-smokers not to start, (4) most effective in motivating
smokers to quit, (5) most effective in motivating smokers to reduce consumption and (6)
most effective for motivating youth to purchase the pack. The order that respondents were
shown each set of packs was randomised
Analysis summary: All analyses were conducted on weighted data. For pack perceptions,
Chi2 tests used to examine for differences in the proportion of respondents selecting each
pack. Logistic regression models were run to examine differences in perceptions (attention-
grabbing, attractiveness and youth motivation to purchase) of the limited-edition packs in
comparison to regular and standardised packs. For each of the 3 limited-edition packs, the
dependent variables were attention-grabbing (where 0 = selecting the regular or SP as most
attention-grabbing and 1 = selecting the limited-edition pack as most attention-grabbing),
attractiveness (0 = selecting the regular or SP as most attractive and 1 = selecting the limited-
edition pack as most attractive) and youth purchase motivation (0 = selecting the regular
or SP as most likely to motivate youth to purchase the pack and 1 = selecting the limited-
edition pack as most likely to motivate youth to purchase the pack). Gender, age (18 - 34 vs
35+ years) and smoking status (non-smoker vs smoker) were entered as predictor variables
in each of the models. Logistic regressions were also conducted to examine whether SPs, in
comparison to regular and limited-edition packs, were perceived by smokers as more likely
to reduce consumption or motivate quitting. Gender, age, daily cigarette consumption (<
10 cigarettes per day vs 10+ cigarettes per day) and quit intentions (intending to quit vs not
intending to quit) were used as predictor variables. A separate logistic regression was also
conducted to test whether SPs were perceived by non-smokers as a means for preventing
non-smokers from starting, this time using age and gender as predictor variables. For each of
the 3 SPs (Camel, Lucky Strike and Gauloises), the dependent variable was either reducing
consumption (0 = regular/limited-edition pack, 1 = SP), motivating quitting (0 = regular/
limited-edition pack, 1 = SP) or preventing non-smokers from starting (0 = regular/limited-
edition pack, 1 = SP)

Date: March - April 2008
Design: Between-participants experimental design. Participants were randomly exposed,
via showcards, to 1 of 4 pictures of cigarette packs: either a branded Marlboro pack, or
a white, grey or brown standardised Marlboro pack
Participants
540 people aged 15 - 25 years; adolescent and young adult smokers and non-smokers.
Street intercept interviews (approached and surveyed in the street) were used. Average
age: 19.6 years. Males 49.4% (n = 266) females 50.6% (n = 273)
Interventions
IV: Marlboro branded vs 3 different colours of Marlboro standardised
Branded = Real brand, Marlboro (note: All packs had the (black and white) text warning
‘Fumer Tue’ (Smoking Kills) covering 30% of the front panel of the pack. Only picture
of front of pack shown
Standardised (plain) = white, grey or brown plain pack with Marlboro printed in a
standardised black font in the centre of the pack
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: product appeal (attention-grabbing, attractive, original,
nice, flashy, trendy, motivatespurchase), perceptionsof the cigarettesinside (goodquality,
light taste) and the most salient feature of the pack (asked unaided what they first saw
on pack - assessing health warning and brand name prominence)
Analysis summary:
A 5-point semantic differential scale was used to measure pack perceptions: “attention
grabbing”, “attractive”, “original”,“nice”, “flashy”, “trendy” and “motivates purchase”.
Perceptions of the cigarettes inside (good quality, light taste) were also assessed, on a
5-point Likert scale, ranging from strongly disagree = 1 to strongly agree = 5. Health
warning and brand name prominence was assessed by asking participants, unaided, what
they first saw on the cigarette pack. Pearson’s Chi2 tests were performed to examine brand
name and health warning prominence on the different packs. Gender, age and smoking
status were used as predictor variables. Logistic regression models were conducted to

examine the effect of these variables on the awareness of health warning and brand name.
For pack perceptions and purchase intentions assessed on 5-point Likert scales, Fisher’s
tests (ANOVA: analysis of variance) were conducted to test differences between the pack
conditions (‘branded vs plain packs’ and then if significant ‘grey vs white vs brown plain
packs’). Bonferroni t-tests were used for multiple pairwise comparisons. The moderating
hypothesis was confirmed when this interaction was significant. Variance analyses were
thus conducted, the independent variables being the packs (‘branded vs plain packs’
and ‘grey vs white vs brown plain packs’) and the presumed moderator (gender, age and
smoking status)

the 10-day study, a recruitment questionnaire was used to determine eligibility (NOTE:
18 - 25-year-old RYO smokers *need to buy enough RYO tobacco to last for the 10 days
of the study). The recruiters also needed to visit their home within the next week or so,
on a day and at a time suitable for them, in order to transfer the rolling tobacco they
had purchased into different packs)
Interventions
Participants used their own RYO tobacco transferred to standardised packs for 10 days
Branded = own brand
Standardised (plain) = same dark brown-green colour as those used in Australia (Pantone
448C), with the brand name in the same typeface (Lucida Sans) and font size and colour
(Pantone Cool Gray 2C). 75% pictorial HW on both sides
Outcomes
[Secondary non=behavioural]: Baseline (branded RYO packs) and follow-up (stan-
dardised RYO packs) questionnaires assessing measures:
1. Packaging appeal:
· Brand attachment: 5 items were aggregated in 1 component and mean used
· Brand attitude (liking brand)
· Pack perceptions (desirability, attractiveness, style, fashion and coolness)
· Pack attitude (liking pack)
2. Taste (good, natural, light)
3. Pack quality·
- Quality
· Feelings when smoking (satisfaction, pleasure)
· Feelings when smoking in the presence of others (embarrassment, image)
4. Purchase and smoking behaviour
5. 2 items were used to measure the credibility of warnings, and whether they made
participants more aware of tobacco dangers
6. Feel like quitting
Analysis summary: t-tests for paired samples compared mean scores for participants’
own packs and standardised packs

Methods
Country: France
Setting: In-home survey (BL), in 5 cities in France (Paris, Marseille, Metz, Nantes,
Toulouse) and online survey follow-up after 10-day study was over (smoking from stan-
dardised pack)
Date: March 2013
Design: Pre-post test
Participants
142 adult women (aged 25 - 40) regular (daily/weekly) and occasional smokers. Oppor-
tunistic recruiting (intercept study - approached in street in cities listed above). However,
no locations for street intercept given, ‘dans la rue.’ A meeting took place in their home
for the interview and participants were provided with study materials (to transfer their
own cigarettes into a plain pack to smoke for the next 10 days) and baseline survey
based on their own branded pack of cigarettes. All study instructions were given at this
primary meeting. Participants filled out an online survey after the 10-day study was over
(smoking from plain pack)
Average age 32.9 years
Interventions
IV: Branded (BL) vs standardised pack usage for 10 days
Branded = Participants used their own branded pack ((e.g. Vogue, Camel, Marlboro,
Winston), would have had 2013 EU warning, 30% text front and 40% picture back
Standardised (plain) = “Identical” to Australian packs [Drab brown with text in grey].

Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: 1. perceptions and attitudes towards packages cigarettes
and the tobacco brand; 2. perception of cigarettes contained in the packages and health
messages; 3. feelings against smoking and smoking of others; 4. behavioural intentions
(want to stop smoking, reduce number smoked, etc.). Responses were measures on a 5-
point Likert scale: 1 = strongly disagree 2 = slightly disagree 3 = no opinion 4 = slightly
agree 5 = strongly agree OR responses could be by the Osgood scale : Score: 1 (not
attractive) to 5 (very attractive)
Analysis summary: Respondents filled out a baseline (pre-test) survey based on their
own branded pack of cigarettes (interview at home, before the use of packages neutral)
and neutral packets after the initial interview for 10 days (online survey): Pre-test =
face-to-face interview; Post-test = online survey. Naturalistic study, own packs vs plain
packs with own brand name; In order to compare the outcomes (averaged) ’classic’ vs

Setting: online survey
Date: Not stated
Design: between-participants experiment with 5 (degree of standardised packaging and
graphic health warning) x3 (brand types) design, using a web-based methodology to
expose adolescents to 1 (out of 15) randomly selected cigarette pack, during which
respondents completed ratings of the pack
Participants
1087 14- to 17-year-olds - smokers and non-smokers
Panel members were originally sourced from various methods including computer-as-
sisted telephone interviews and face-to- face and online market research databases. Panel
members were contacted by e-mail and asked whether they were willing to allow their
child to complete an online survey about cigarette packaging being conducted by The
Cancer Council Victoria
Average age 15.4 years. 537 male (49.4%). Smokers: Established smoker: 193 (17.8%);
Experimenter: 238 (21.9%) Experimenters + Established Smokers n = 430, 39.6%) Non-
susceptible non-smoker + Susceptible non-smoker = 656 Nonsusceptible non-smoker:
45.4%; Susceptible non-smoker 15.0% (combined 60.4%)
Interventions
IV: branding and graphic health warnings and brand types
Branded = Branded Pack: used the 3 most popular Australian brands (Winfield; Peter
Jackson; Longbeach). Pack variants (Winfield “Blue”; Peter Jackson “Rich”; Longbeach
“Rich”) were those that were most popular among adult smokers. All the conditions
mentioned had the same graphic health warning visible on the top (i.e. 30% of the pack
face) as required by Australian Government legislation
Standardised (plain) = Standardised pack 1: a plain cardboard brown pack that main-
tained the brand name font (i.e. original font size, style and position) and positioning
of brand and descriptor;
Standardised pack 2: a plain cardboard brown pack, with brand name in standard font
in a prominent position on the pack and descriptor information in standard font at the
bottom;
Standardised pack 3: a plain cardboard brown pack, with brand name in smaller standard
font positioned at the bottom, and “(xx number) cigarettes” in larger font in a prominent
position on the pack;
Standardised pack 4, added a large graphic health warning (covering 80% of the front
of the pack) to the plainest pack tested (standardised pack 3). Packages were cardboard
brown. All the other standardised packs had 30% warnings

Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: looking at the same pack throughout 1) rate attributes
of the displayed pack including: “This pack looks as if it would be: “popular among
smokers”; “attractive”; “good value for money”; “an exclusive/expensive brand”; and “a
brand you might try/smoke.” 2) number of attributes of typical smokers of the pictured
cigarette pack, including: “A typical smoker of this pack is.”: “trendy/stylish”; “young”;
“masculine”; “lower class”; “sociable/outgoing”; and “confident/successful”. 3) respon-
dents were asked to think about how a cigarette from the pictured pack might taste;
and to 4) rate a number of descriptions on how well they relate to the pack shown,
including: “I think these cigarettes might.”: “be rich in tobacco flavour”; “be low in tar
and nicotine”; “taste of cheap tobacco”; “be satisfying”; “be like a light cigarette”; “be of
the highest quality tobacco”; and “be harsh on the throat.” Within each of the questions,
attributes were presented randomly to avoid order effects. 5) after the pack was removed
from view, respondents were asked “Thinking back to the pack you just saw, please write
down the health warning that appeared at the top of the pack.”
Analysis summary: email link to online survey. A principal components analysis using
oblique rotation was performed to examine which components within each outcome
measure category (i.e. pack characteristics, smoker characteristics, sensory perceptions)
loaded together. (1) positive pack characteristics-“ popular among smokers”; “attractive
pack”; “goodvalue formoney”; “exclusive/expensive”; “abrand youmighttry/smoke”; (2)
positive smoker characteristics-“ trendy”; “young”; “masculine”; “sociable”; “confident”;
(3) negative taste-“cheap”; “harsh”; (4) light taste - “low tar”; “light’; (5) positive taste-
“rich”; “satisfying”; “high quality’. Analysis of variance tests were conducted to explore
mean differences in ratings of plain packs 1, 2, and 3 as compared with original branded
packs. Analyses of variance were also conducted to compare plain pack 3 with plain
pack 4, to examine the effect on pack ratings of adding a large graphic health warning
to 80% of the front of the pack. The interaction between smoking experience and
pack conditions on pack ratings was analysed. Finally, Chi2 analyses were conducted to
examine respondents’ recall of the graphic health warning by pack condition. Wherever
multiple pairwise comparisons were conducted, Bonferroni adjustments were made

Country: Australia
Setting: large Social and Community Welfare Organisation in Western Sydney, New

Date: March - December 2012
Design: Between-participants2×2factorial designtrial embeddedwithinacross-sectional
computer touchscreen survey
Participants
354 socially disadvantaged welfare aid adult recipients (aged 18+) who were current
smokers were recruited. The sample was drawn from a service outlet of a large, national
non-government, social and community service organisation (SCSO). The service pro-
vides ‘emergency relief’ welfare such as food vouchers, grocery items and financial aid
to individuals experiencing various forms of social and financial hardship across a large
catchment area of Western Sydney. The client profile of SCSOs includes an over-rep-
resentation of disadvantaged groups including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders,
single parents, long-term unemployed and those whose primary income is a government
benefit. Participants were introduced to the study when they attended the SCSO for their
emergency relief appointment. Staff explained that there was a study about smoking.
If interested, they were led to a private room where a research assistant provided more
detailed info and assistance to complete the survey if needed. Participation was assumed
to be consent. Participants received a AUD 20 gift voucher for participating

Interventions
IV: The 4 pack conditions were: (1) branded Winfield Blue 25; (2) standardised Winfield
Blue 25; (3) branded B&H Smooth 25 and (4) Standardised B&H Smooth 25. Within
each pack condition, respondents were presented with a standard set of items to rate their
assigned pack. Plain pack digital images were created using specifications outlined in the
Australian Government’s Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011, while images of branded
packs were supplied by the Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer, Victoria, Australia
Branded = Branded pack conditions replicated cigarette packs available for purchase at
the time of survey. 2 of the most popular brand variants in the Australian mainstream:
branded Winfield blue and branded premium Benson and Hedges Smooth 25
Standardised (plain) = Australian: dark brown-green colour (Pantone 448C), with the
brand name in the same typeface (Lucida Sans) and font size and colour (Pantone Cool
Gray 2C)
All pack conditions featured the same graphic image and text HW: ‘smoking causes
peripheral vascular disease’ that
first appeared on Australian cigarette packs in 2006. These were pre- and post-real
packages in Australia - so 30% front-of-pack warnings increased to 75% of the pack face,
and 90% back-of-pack warnings remained
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: Participants were asked to rate their assigned pack on
measures of brand appeal and purchase intentions. Brand appeal: rated packs on brand
appeal scales (1 - 7) Purchase Intentions: Participants were presented with images of the
2 brand name options (Winfield and B&H) on a single screen and asked: “If you ran
out of cigarettes and only the packs below were available in the store you went to, which
would you be most tempted to buy?” Participants could choose between the 2 brand
name images or select ”I would not buy any“
Analysis summary: Participants were randomly allocated to 1 of the 4 cigarette pack
conditions by Digivey’s randomise function, which uses a pseudo-random number gen-
erator provided by the underlying programming language. Participants who had pre-
viously viewed and rated a standardised packaging image, received standardised image
response options, and those who had previously rated a branded packaging image (i.e.
pack A or C) received branded image response options at this question; Pairwise com-
parisons using the Wilcoxon rank sum test were undertaken to compare median scores
between branded packaging and standardised packaging for each of the 2 brand names.
OR analyses were used to assess the effect of packaging type (branded vs standardised)
on purchase intention

Design: Within-participants online experiment. Participants were asked to compare pairs
of cigarette packs on 5 measures: taste, tar delivery, health risk, attractiveness and either
ease of quitting (adult smokers) or brand they would choose if trying smoking (youth)
Participants
Respondents were recruited from a proprietary consumer panel managed by the UK sur-
vey firm, ‘YouGov’, which consisted of over 185,000 individuals. Current adult smokers,
and youth sample with no specific smoking status, required for eligibility (Adults: aged
18+, smokers Youth: < aged 11 - 17.) Adults who reported at least 1 cigarette in the past
month were eligible. No criteria for youth (< 18 years)

Adults: 38.5 years (13.6) Youth: 14.6 years (2.0)
Interventions
IV: branded versus standardised pack pair comparisons
Branded = Cigarette packs used in this study featured leading UK Brands (Marlboro,
Mayfair, Lambert & Butler and Richmond). Brands were purposefully selected to exam-
ine common brand descriptors and colour variations
Standardised (plain) = 2 standardised pack comparisons: (1) standardised versus branded
packs and (2) standardised with descriptor versus plain without descriptor. 2 of the brand
pairs (‘L&B Gold’ vs. ‘L&B King Size’ and ‘Mayfair Smooth’ vs. ‘Mayfair King Size’)
were modified to examine the impact of standardised packaging. Standardised versions
of these packs were created by substituting all brand imagery and colour for a plain
‘white’ background or a plain ‘brown’ background. The name of each brand was printed
in Arial 14 point font. All of the packs shown to participants displayed the same pictorial
health warning covering 30% of the ‘front’ of the pack in anticipation of the pictorial
warnings that were introduced in the UK in October 2008, 4 months after the study
was conducted
Outcomes

Analysis summary: Randomly assigned to a group which included branded + standard-
ised packs (type of plain: white or brown). For each of the 5 questions (tar level, health
risk, etc.), a ‘Difference Scale’ was calculated to examine how often respondents selected
either of the packs, as opposed to selecting ‘no difference’. A score of ‘1’ was assigned each
time respondents selected either of the 2 packs. Scores were summed across the 8 brand
pairs for a total score between 0 and 8. A ‘Light/Low Tar Brand’ Scale was calculated
in the same way to examine how often respondents selected brands designated as ‘light/

Methods
Country: USA
Setting: Online
Date: February 2010
Design: Between-participants experiment (random assignment to 1 of 4 experimental
conditions)
Participants
National sample of 826 18- to 19-year-old females including both smokers and non-
smokers. Participants were recruited from a consumer panel through Global Market
Insite, Inc. (GMI), with a panel reach of more than 2.8 million individuals in the USA.
Participants were randomised to view 8 cigarette packs designed according to 1 of 4
experimental conditions: fully-branded female packs, same packs without descriptors (e.
g. “ slims ” ), same packs without brand imagery or descriptors (“ plain ” packs) , and
branded non-female brands. Participants rated packs on measures of appeal and health
risk and completed a behavioural pack selection task
Average age 18.5 years. 100% female. Current smokers (daily, weekly, monthly) = 323;
Daily smoker: 24.3% (n = 199) Weekly smoker: 9.8% (80) Monthly smoker: 5.4% (44)
; 39.1% current smokers
503 non-smokers 60.9%
Interventions
IV: 3 branded (1 without descriptors) vs 1 standardised
Branded = The 8 “female-oriented” brands were selected based on market share or
popularity among smokers, as well as previous research. 6 of the 8 brands are sold in
the USA; the Vogue and Silk Cut brands are sold in the UK. These brands featured
the descriptors superslims, slims, lights, menthol, blue, rose, cherry, and smooth, as
well as “traditional” female colour schemes, such as pink, white, and other pastels. The
brand descriptors and brand imagery of each female-oriented package was modified
according to the experimental condition. Condition 1 packs featured all brand imagery
and descriptors (female standard condition). Condition 2 packs featured brand imagery
but no descriptors (female no descriptors condition). Condition 4 included non-female-
oriented “male” packages as a control condition. These brands were also chosen based
on market share and included popular “full-flavour” or “regular” varieties of American
cigarette brands that lacked overtly female design elements
Standardised (plain) = Condition 3 (female standardised condition), packs were shown
without either brand imagery or descriptors, a light brown/beige cardboard look
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: Pack ratings: 1) Brand Appeal (“How appealing is this
brand of cigarettes compared to other brands on the market?”); 2) Brand Taste (”How
do you think these cigarettes would taste compared to other brands?”); 3)Tar Delivery
(“How much tar do you think these cigarettes would have compared to other brands?”)
; and 4) Health Risks (“Compared to other cigarette brands on the market, would these
cigarettes be . . . less/more harmful?“). Responses were provided on a 5-point Likert scale
(e.g. 1 = a lot more appealing, 2 = a little more appealing, 3 = no difference, 4 = a little
less appealing, and 5 = a lot less appealing ). Ratings were subsequently coded as either
a 1 (a little /a lot more appealing) or 0 (a little/a lot less appealing and no difference). All
analyses run with binary variable, as well as with the “original ” 5-point Likert ratings.
Authors present data for the binary measure of appeal, taste, tar, and health risk but note
pattern of results was the same regardless of whether the binary outcome or the original
5-point rating was used. An overall index rating was created for each of the 5 ratings, by
summing scores across the 8 packages to yield a score between 0 and 8, where the number
corresponds to the total number of packs rated as more appealing/better taste/lower tar/

less harmful. Smoker Image Ratings: For each cigarette package, respondents were asked
to identify the typical smoker of each pack by answering the question, “ In your opinion,
someone who chooses to smoke this brand is more likely to be . . . ” for 7 characteristics:
female/male, glamorous/not glamorous, cool/not cool, popular/not popular, attractive/
unattractive, slim/overweight, and sophisticated/not sophisticated. For each set of traits,
respondents could choose either trait or no difference . The female/male question was
recoded so female was scored a “ 1 ” and male , no difference , and don’t know were scored
a “0”. For the remaining traits, the more desirable trait (e.g. glamorous) was scored a “1”,
and the less desirable trait (e.g. not glamorous), no difference, and don’t know were scored
a “0”.
Behavioural Task - Pack Selection: Respondents were asked which, if any, packs they
would like to be sent upon conclusion of the study. Respondents could select 1 of the 4
cigarette packs displayed on the screen. Images presented in random order and included
: (1) a fully-branded female pack , (2) a plain female pack , (3) a fully-branded non-
female pack, and (4) a plain non-female pack. Each of the packs was drawn at random
from the packs used in each experimental condition. Participants could also select an “
I do not want a pack of cigarettes ” option, which was prominently displayed on the
screen. Note that participants were informed after making their selection that no packs
would actually be mailed and the study did not promote or endorse smoking in any way
Analysis summary: Regression models were used to examine the effect of experimental
condition for 3 primary outcomes: pack ratings, smoker image ratings, and beliefs about
smoking. For each outcome, regression models were conducted in 2 steps. In Step 1,
the model included only the “condition” variable. In Step 2 of the model, the following
variables were entered as covariates: age, education, income, ethnicity, smoking status,
and weight concerns. In Step 3, all 2-way interactions with the “condition” variable were
tested by entering each interaction term into the model 1 at a time

IV: 4 conditions
Branded = Female-oriented packaging was modified according to the experimental con-
dition:
1) branded female-oriented packs
2) female-oriented branded packs, no descriptors (e.g. “slims”)
3) standardised: female-oriented packs, no branding or descriptors, cardboard-coloured
4) control: popular UK brands but non-female-oriented packs
Standardised = condition 3)
The 10 “female-oriented” brands were selected based on previous research. Brands were
purposefully selected to examine the descriptors superslims, menthol, frost, silver, pink,
purple, blue, cherry, vanilla, and arome, as well as “traditional” female colour schemes,
such as pink and white
All had black and white text warning (UK 30%)
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: Participants were asked to rate each package on 4 mea-
sures: (1) brand appeal (“How appealing is this brand of cigarettes compared to other
brands on the market?”); (2) brand taste (“How do you think these cigarettes would
taste, compared to other brands?”); (3) tar delivery (“How much tar do you think these
cigarettes would have compared to other brands?”); and (4) health risks (“Compared to
other cigarette brands on the market, would these cigarettes be . . . less/more harmful?”).
Responses were provided on a 5-point Likert scale (e.g. 1 “A lot more appealing” to 5 “A
lot less appealing”) and subsequently coded as either a 1 (“a little”/“a lot more appealing”)
or 0 (“a little”/“a lot less appealing” and “no difference”). An overall index rating was
created for each of the 4 measures, by summing scores across the 10 packages to yield a
score between 0 and 10. Smoker image ratings: respondents asked to identify the typical
smoker of each pack for 7 characteristics: female/male, glamorous/not glamorous, cool/
not cool, popular/not popular, attractive/unattractive, slim/overweight, sophisticated/
not sophisticated. An index variable was created for each of the 7 characteristics by sum-
ming the number of desirable traits endorsed by smokers across the 10 brands (1 for each
desirable characteristic, female considered desirable, range: 0 - 10). An overall “smoker
image” variable was created by calculating the average across each of the 7 characteristics.
At the end of the experiment, participants were asked which pack they would like out
of either 4 fully-branded packs vs 4 plain packs (2 conditions between participants), or
if they did not want a pack. Packs shown were randomly selected from the experimental
conditions. Participants were told immediately after they made their selection that they
would not be given the pack
Analysis summary: Participants randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups. Within each con-
dition participants viewed 10 cigarette packages presented 1 at a time, participants could
look at the pack for as long as they wanted. Because differences in smoking behaviour
were observed between experimental conditions, all linear regression models included
the following covariates: age, education, ethnicity, smoking status, and weight concerns.
Therefore, all values reported from the linear regression models represent “adjusted”
values. Unstandardised betas are reported for all linear regression models. Finally, com-
parisons across conditions for each of the individual 10 female-oriented packages were
tested using logistic regression models, where 1 more appealing, better taste, lower tar,
and less harmful, and 0 no difference or less appealing, worse taste, higher tar, and more
harmful, adjusting for age, education, ethnicity, smoking status, and weight concerns.

IV: Standardised vs branded packs
Branded = Each pair included the same reference pack, a branded Benson and Hedges
(B&H) pack on the UK market at the time of the study, alongside a B&H pack modified
according to the factorial design. 1 additional pair of packs was viewed to test consumer
perceptions of ‘Superslims’ packaging. The pair consisted of a regular Silk Cut branded
pack and a Silk Cut ‘Superslims’ variety, both of which were available on the UK market.
Branded packs carried a 40% text warning only (warnings at the bottom of the pack)
Standardised (plain) = Either brown or white. Warning labels on the standardised packs
were of 3 different types and sizes: (40% text warning, 40% pictorial warning or 80%
pictorial warning). All B&H except 1, Silk Cut Superslims
Outcomes
[Secondarynon-behavioural]: attractive, smooth taste, health risk, tarlevel, trysmoking
and warning impact. Which pack would they choose
Analysis summary: Chi2 tests were used to examine whether there was a significant
difference in the proportion of participants who selected either pack within each pair
for each of the 6 outcomes. ‘Neither/no difference’ responses were excluded from this
analysis. To adjust for multiple comparisons, the Benjamin-Hochberg adjustment was
applied. 20 GEE models were used to test for differences across the 6 pairs for each of the
6 outcomes. Separate GEE models were used for each outcome. All 6 pack pairs had the
same reference group (the regular branded B&H pack) hence the outcome of interest in
each model was the proportion of individuals who selected the unbranded comparison
pack. The 2 factors, standardised pack colour and warning type, were entered as indicator
variables in the model. ‘Neither/no difference’ responses were grouped with responses
for those who selected the branded pack for this analysis. The 2-way interaction between
standardised pack colour and warning type was tested by running additional GEE models
with the interaction term. Chi2 and GEE analyses. Models adjusted for age, gender,
smoking status (never smoked or prefer not to say vs tried smoking or current smoker)

Interventions
Respondents were shown 10 choice sets, each containing 4 packs with different combi-

1) pack structure (slim, lipstick, booklet, traditional);
2) brand (“Vogue,” “du Maurier”);
3) branding (branded, standardised);
4) warning label size (50%, 75%); and
5) price (CAD 8.45, CAD 10.45).
Each choice set contained 4 pack profiles and the alternative ‘none’ The choice sets were
presented as 2D image. Pack profiles were generated by combining different levels of
each attribute. A subset of 37 pack profiles were selected arranged into 10 orthogonal
and balanced choice sets. To mitigate the potential that 2D images could underestimate
the effect of different shapes and sizes, 1 additional balanced and orthogonal choice set
was created and marked as a holdout. Each holdout profile was presented to respondents
as a video, which offered a means to illustrate the structural differences between packs
in a 3D format, including package depth and opening-style

Standardised (plain) = For 1) traditional vs alternative structures. For 3) standardised is
an option. Followed the Australian model, same dark brown-green colour as those used
in Australia (Pantone 448C), with the brand name in the same typeface (Lucida Sans)
and font size and colour (Pantone Cool Gray 2C)
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: The outcome measures were pilot-tested through cog-
nitive interviews to ensure question wording was relevant to smokers and non-smokers
and perceived in similar ways. For each choice set, respondents chose the brand that they:
(1) would rather try, (2) would taste better, and (3) would be less harmful, or “none.
” For each outcome, the attributes’ impact on consumer choice was analysed using a
multinomial logit model
Analysis summary: Multinomial logit models were used to analyse the effect of each
attribute on the 3 outcomes. Responses were analysed based on Random Utility Theory.
Fitting the Multinomial Logit Model Attribute-level importance was modelled by the
main effects multinomial logit models and estimated using “binary” coding. The multi-
nomial logit models were extended to estimate 2 attribute interactions. The estimated
parameter coefficients from the main effects model, and respecified using “effects” cod-
ing, were used in subsequent analyses to assess attribute importance. Attribute impor-
tance was expressed as a percentage and calculated by comparing ranges of attribute-level
coefficient values, i.e. the difference between an attribute’s highest and lowest parameter
coefficient values. The relative importance weight of each attribute was calculated with

respect to the sum of utility ranges. To account for the moderating effect of smoking sta-
tus and age, adjusted multinomial logit models were constructed using “effects” coding
by interacting smoking status and age with each attribute. Smoking status was modelled
as a categorical variable (smoker, non-smoker), and age was modelled as a continuous
variable

factor and pack type (branded/standardised) and eye gaze location (health warning or
branding) as within-participants factors
Participants
A convenience sample of adolescents aged 14 - 19 comprising never-smokers (n = 26),
experimenters (n = 34), weekly smokers (n = 13) and daily smokers (n = 14). Average age
of sample: 16.6 years; 44.8% (n = 39) male. They were recruited from 3 comprehensive (i.
e state-run, open to pupils of all abilities) out of 6 such schools that were contacted about
the study and responded. Recruitment of the pupils was led by a psychology teacher in
each of the 3 schools and most participants were studying psychology at GCSE (General
Certificate of Secondary Education) examinations which are taken at age 16, or A-level,
examinations which are taken at age 18. Pupils who expressed an interest in participating
arranged a testing time with the teacher and testing was completed during either their
psychology lesson or during a period
Interventions
IV: branded vs standardised packs
Branded = Branded pack images were taken from the 10 popular cigarette brands in the
UK (Benson & Hedges, Lambert and Butler, Mayfair, Richmond, Silk Cut, Embassy,
Marlboro, Player’s Gold Leaf, Royals and Sterling)
Standardised (plain) = Standardised white pack images were taken from an example of a
standardised pack created for Action on Smoking and Health (England), and modified
to create 10 standardised pack images with the cigarette brand names described above
included as plain text. 10 different pictorial health warnings, selected at random from
those in use at that time on cigarette packs in the UK, were paired with each of branded
and standardised pack images, to create a total of 200 stimuli (100 branded, 100 stan-
dardised). These pictorial warnings were placed on the rear panel of packs in the UK at
that time. In this study they were placed on the front of the pack, as semantic content
(i.e. written health warnings) is known to capture visual attention preferentially
Outcomes
[Secondary, behavioural]: number of eye movements(dominant eye)to health warnings
and branding on standardised and branded packs
Analysis summary: Eye-position data were analysed offline using an automatic saccade
detection procedure. A saccade was defined as a change in eye position with a minimum
velocity of 30 degrees/second, or a minimal acceleration threshold of 8000 degrees/
second. A fixation started after the velocity fell below this value for 5 successive samples.
The primary outcome was the number of eye movements made to 2 regions of interest:
(i) the lower part of the cigarette packs comprising the health warning (7.4 x 10.3 degrees
visual angle in height and width, respectively), and (ii) the upper part of the cigarette
pack comprising the branding (10.4 x 10.3 degrees of visual angle). A 4 (smoking status:
never-smoker, experimenter, weekly smoker, daily smoker) x2 (saccade landing position:
health warning, branding) x2 (pack type: plain, branded) analysis of variance was used to
analyse the number of eye movements data. Interaction effects were explored by further
stratified analyses

Design: Repeated measures design, using eyelink 2 eye tracker
Participants
A convenience sample of 30 adult (18 - 40 years) daily dependent smokers from students
and staff at University of Bristol and the general population. Average age 21.0 years (63%
men (n = 11)
Interventions
Standardised pack 1: Brand name but no variant. Cardboard-coloured, with 30% pic-
torial warning
Standardised pack 2 (blank pack): No brand name or variant, cardboard-coloured with
30% pictorial warning
Packs carried either a familiar UK EU pictorial warning and an unfamiliar EU pictorial
warning not used in the UK. The 10 familiar and unfamiliar warnings were matched on
effectiveness based on a pre-study pilot. Branded pack images: taken from 10 popular
tobacco brands in the UK (Benson & Hedges, Lambert & Butler, Mayfair, Richmond,
Silk Cut, Embassy, Marlboro, Player’s Gold Leaf, Royals and Sterling)
Outcomes
[Secondary behavioural]: Physiological, the number of fixations to health warnings and
branding on the different pack types
Analysis summary: Eye-position data were analysed in the same way as in their previous
studies (Maynard et al. 2013; Munafò et al. 2011). A 2 (eye gaze location: health warning,
branding) ×3 (pack type: branded, plain, blank) ×2 (health warning familiarity: familiar,
unfamiliar) analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyse the data on the number
of saccades. Interaction effects were explored by further stratified analyses corrected for
multiple comparisons, using the Bonferroni method. In cases where Mauchly’s Test of
Sphericity indicated that the assumption of sphericity had been violated, Greenhouse
Geisser corrected values were used. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen’s d for t-tests
and eta-squared for ANOVA. To describe the focus of participants’ attention, a time-
course analysis was conducted for each of the 3 pack types

cigarette pack (i.e., one without any branding). While this is possible and may explain
some of the attention directed to this area of the pack, it is unlikely that this explains
why smokers attended this region of the pack for approximately 8000 ms, for each of the
20 blank packs shown to them. Second, to further investigate the effect of branding on
visual attention, it would be interesting to see how the participants’ own cigarette brand
influences viewing patterns. However, as information on participants’ preferred brands
was not obtained, this analysis cannot be performed.”

equal number of people aged 18 - 34 and 35+. 50% male (n = 64)
Interventions
IV: Usual brand vs standardised
Branded = Participants were given their usual UK branded pack of cigarettes (Marlboro
Gold, Marlboro Red, Dunhill Red, Benson and Hedges Gold, Benson and Hedges Silver)
. Warning on Branded Pack and Plain Pack were attempted to match: ’Smoking harms
babies’ on plain pack and ’Smoking when pregnant harms your baby’
Standardised = Australian plain pack of cigarettes which matched their preferred UK
brand. Note Plain packs had the text-plus graphic on all packs (where UK branded had
text-only on front 30% and text-plus-graphic 40% on the back)
Outcomes
[Primary]: consumption during the 24-hour smoking day.
[Secondary behavioural]: Physiological, volume of smoke inhaled; forgo cigarettes, stub
out cigarette early, smoke less around others, keep pack out of sight, cover pack. These
and the 2 questions about thinking about quitting below were statements answered with
binary (yes/no) responses. ‘Yes’ responses were summed to create an overall score of
smoking behaviour
[Secondary non-behavioural]: 1) self-reported ratings of motivation to quit smoking
(as measured by the Quitting Contemplation Ladder); think about quitting in the next
few weeks, think about quitting within a year. 2) the cigarette taste test (To assess the
taste of the cigarettes smoked at the blind ‘tasting’ on the baseline day, participants
were asked “How did this cigarette taste”, and when they returned on the final test
day, participants were asked “How did the cigarettes in the pack given to you yesterday
taste”. To answer these questions participants were required to report their agreement
with the statements “The taste of this cigarette was strong/harsh/dry/stale /dull/dirty”,
each on a 7-point scale between “Strongly disagree” to “Strongly agree”. Participants also
reported on a 7-point scale between “Much better” to “Much worse” the answer to the
question “Compared to my usual cigarette, the taste of this cigarette is…”; 3) At the final
test day, participants also answered a series of questions about their experiences on the

smoking test day. To assess ‘Experience of smoking’, participants were asked, “To what
extent did you experience the following as you smoked the cigarettes? a) Enjoyment, b)
Satisfaction, c) Acceptance”; 4) To assess ‘Experience of using the pack’, participants
were asked “To what extent did you experience the following about the cigarette pack?
a) Embarrassment, b) Shame, c) Acceptance”; 5) To assess ’Rating of cigarette pack
attributes’, i.e. participants ’perceptions of the packs, participants were asked to “Rate
the cigarette pack on the following attributes: a) Style, b) Fashion, c) Cheapness, d)
Coolness, e) Attractiveness, f ) Quality, g) Appeal”; 6) To assess participants’ ‘Rating
of the health warning’, participants were asked to “Rate the health warning on the
following attributes: a) Noticing, b) Seriousness, c) Believability, d) Awareness of health
risks”. Mean responses across the sub-questions were then calculated in order to calculate
an overall response for each of the 5 questions. 7) Participants were also asked to report
their ‘Attitudes to plain packs’ by answering the following 3 questions “Do you think
plainpackagingwouldmake yousmoke fewercigarettes?”,“Doyouthinkplainpackaging
would help you to quit smoking?” and “Do you think plain packaging would prevent
children from starting smoking?”. Each of these questions was answered on a 4-point
scale, with higher scores indicating higher agreement with each of the questions
Analysis summary: Linear regression was used to evaluate the effect of cigarette pack-
aging (branded or plain) on the primary and secondary outcome measures. Analyses
were conducted with and without adjustment for age, gender, heaviness of smoking and,
where appropriate, corresponding baseline measures. Whether these effects differed be-
tween men and women was investigated by including appropriate interaction terms in
the models

pack image freely available from the Tobacco Labelling Resource Library
Standardised (plain) = Displayed the brand name in standard font, and were brown
in colour. Warnings in the loss-framed condition were those proposed by the FDA

conveying health risks of smoking (e.g. ’Cigarettes cause cancer’). Adapted the warning-
label message text to emphasise the benefits of quitting (e.g. ’Quitting smoking reduces
the risk of cancer’). All cigarette packs used images from the FDA-proposed warning
labels (50%). Although the size of the image depended on participants’ computer screens,
images were scaled to the dimensions of a standard US cigarette pack, spaced equally
apart, and shown in the same layout for all participants. NOTE: Personalised and non-
personalised were grouped together as no difference
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: The primary outcome was participants’ motivation to
quit reported in response to the cigarette pack images
Analysis summary: In each condition, participants viewed images of 4 adapted cigarette
packs each of which displayed a pictorial warning, which was treated as a within-par-
ticipants factor in analyses. Participants viewed all 4 pack images presented in the same
manner on a single screen for as long as they wished. The cessation motivation question
was directly below each image. Participants indicated how much each pack image moti-
vated them to quit smoking through a single, 7-point response item anchored at 1 (‘Not
at all’) and 7 (‘A lot’). ‘The information on the packs focused on the benefits of quitting
smoking with a 5-point Likert-type response ranging from 1 (‘Strongly disagree’) to 5
(‘Strongly agree’). Examined success of plain packaging manipulation using an item to
assess whether participants could recall the brand of cigarette packs shown as a proxy for
attention to branding. Response options included Marlboro, Camel, Peter Jackson (the
correct brand) and Newport. ANCOVA then used to assess differences in motivation to
quit on average for all packs and individually for each of the 4 warnings based on framing
and packaging. Bivariate tests (i.e. t-tests, F tests) were used to identify demographic
and smoking-related variables associated with study outcomes for inclusion as covari-
ates in multivariable analyses. A similar series of bivariate tests as well as multivariable
regression were used to determine the success of the experimental manipulations. To
examine differences in motivation to quit between the 4 warning labels, paired t-tests
were used in the full sample and separately by experimental condition. For each set of t-
tests, used a Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons. ANCOVA then
used to assess differences in motivation to quit on average for all packs and individually
for each of the 4 warnings based on framing and packaging. Demographic and smoking-
related characteristics associated with outcome variables in bivariate analyses (P < 0.05)
were included as covariates. Main effects for message framing and packaging and their
interaction were first inspected. Based on the findings, pair-wise adjusted least square
mean differences were evaluated between all 4 study conditions using Tukey’s posthoc
adjustment

Methods
Country: Scotland
Setting: Greater Glasgow
Date: May - June 2010
Design: Counterbalanced repeated measures (within-participants) experiment with 2
weeks using standardised pack and 2 weeks using their own branded packs. Participants
completed questionnaires twice a week resulting in 4 questionnaires per brand type
(referred to as questionnaire 1, 2, etc)
Participants
48 young adult smokers aged 18 - 35 years. Door-knock method from 14 postcode
sectors using random location quota sampling; conducted by market recruiters. Average
age = 27 years; 50% men (n = 24)
Interventions
IV: Branded vs standardised packs
Branded = Own regular pack brand, e.g. the brand they normally smoke. UK cigarette
packs contained 1 of 2 text health warnings on the front (‘Smoking kills’ or ‘Smoking
seriously harms you and others around you’) and 1 of 14 ‘pictorial’ warnings on the
reverse panel, although 3 are in fact text warnings as they do not display a picture, photo,
pictogram or symbol
Standardised (plain) = The plain packs were otherwise identical, with a fictitious brand
name Kerrods, to prevent copyright breach, and all relevant legal markings and a barcode.
All Kerrods packs had the same warning on the pack front TEXT only (’Smoking kills’)

and one ‘pictorial’ warning on the reverse panel showing a set of healthy and diseased
lungs, to save costs
Average size HW for both types of packs: 30% on front and 40% on back
Outcomes
[Secondary behavioural]: smoke less around others, forego smoking, stubbing out
cigarettes early, keeping pack out of sight or covering pack, measured via yes/no responses
[Secondary non-behavioural]: thinking about quitting, motivation to quit, feelings
about smoking (enjoyable, satisfying), pack perceptions(stylish, fashionable, cheap, cool,
attractive, quality, appealing), health warnings (noticeable, believable, seriousness, high-
lighting the health risks of smoking). All measured on 5-point scales
Composite scores were derived for categories of responses (such as pack perceptions,
response to warnings), by summing the individual items and then rescaling to a 5-point
scale
Analysis summary: Analysis focused on comparing ratings between branded and stan-
dardised packs. For each time point, paired t-tests were used to produce mean scores for
the standardised packs relative to mean scores for their own packs. Given the ordinal
nature of the 5-point scales, the Wilcoxon signed rank test, a non-parametric procedure
suited to paired data, was used to test for significant differences between the ratings of
standardised packs versus the ratings of the participant’s own packs at each measure.
Data on occurrence of avoidant behaviours are binary (yes/no), and the McNemar test
was used to test for differences in response between participants’ measures at each time
point on the standardised pack and the respective measure on their own pack

Quote: “A pre-pilot naturalistic study was
then conducted with six smokers, in March
2010, who were provided with 14 plain
packs (without cigarettes inside) and asked
to transfer cigarettes from their packs into
the plain packs each day for a 2-week pe-
riod. They were also asked to complete
identical questionnaires every second day
for these 2 weeks. Questionnaires were de-
veloped by
the research team, primarily from smok-
ers’ reactions to plain packs within the fo-
cus groups, and covered five areas: pack
perceptions, pack feelings, feelings about
smoking, health warnings (measured on
five-point scales) and behavioural change/
avoidant behaviour (measured via yes/no
responses). The items on behaviour change
and avoidant behaviour were adapted from
the International Tobacco Control project.
Two focus groups were subsequently em-
ployed to explore participants’ experience
of using the plain packs, completing and
comprehension of the questionnaires, and
any aspects of the study protocol that
could be improved. The two focus groups
thought that the questionnaire was com-
prehensible but completing it every second
day was cumbersome”

Design: Experimental within-participants design using discrete choice experiments
Participants
658 adolescents 10 - 17 years old. Convenience sample. To maximise awareness of the
survey and encourage participation, the survey was publicised in 4 ways: (a) through the
W-WEST website (youth smoking group, www.w-west.org.uk); (b) via existing NHS
youth services and partner organizations of W-WEST and NHS Greater Glasgow and
Clyde; (c) through existing and trusted media contacts of W-WEST and NHS Greater
Glasgow and Clyde; and (d) via engagement with young people at community events
organised by W-WEST. In each case, young people were informed what the survey was
about and given information on how to access the survey at the W-WEST website if
they chose to do so

Interventions
IV: comparing 3 structural designs and 4 colours for standardised pack comparisons
Branded = Branding was based on shape with the traditional flip-top opening being
considered typical. Hence this condition was brown standardised pack and standard flip-
top opening
Standardised (plain) = (2) Brown standardised packs with 30% warning, 1 pack with
non-standard slide opening, and 1 lipstick-shaped/superslims pack. No brand names. 4
identical but different-coloured standardised packs were also shown in a separate image:
(green, red, light blue, and white)
Health warning: shown in all images “Smoking Kills” on the front, 30% text warning
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: of relevance to this study: 1)Criteria for choosing
cigarettes. Participants were asked “How important do you think each of these things are
to young people who smoke when choosing cigarettes,” with the 5 categories: price, what
their friends/family smoke, seeing a famous person smoke a particular brand, the brand,
and the look of the cigarette pack. All responses were measured on 5-point scales ranging
from 1 (very important) to 5 (not at all important). These were later recoded to binary
variables to calculate the proportion who rated each as “very important” or “important”
(Codes 1 - 2) and those who did not rate each as important (Codes 3 - 5). 2)Pack Colour
4 items were used to assess perceptions of product strength and harm via pack colour
with the help of an image showing 4 identical but differently-coloured packs (green,
red, light blue, and white) with only the health warning “Smoking Kills” on the front.
Participants were asked to look at the 4 differently-coloured packs and answer which
pack they thought would have (a) the strongest tasting cigarettes, (b) the weakest tasting
cigarettes, (c) the most harmful cigarettes, and (d) the least harmful cigarettes. Response
options included the 4 colours, ’they’re all the same’, and ’don’t know’. 3) Structural
preferences for standardised packs. Participants were shown an image of 3 different
dark brown “plain” packs (a regular flip-top pack, a slide pack, and a superslims pack)
and asked (a) which pack they liked the most and (b) which pack people their age would
be most likely to smoke. Response options were Pack 1 (flip-top), Pack 2 (slide pack),
Pack 3 (superslims pack), none of them, and don’t know (see Figure 2)
Analysis summary: Descriptive data were examined and items, originally measured on a
5-point scale, were dichotomised to show the proportion of young people responding to
each item. Chi2 analyses tested differences in responses by ever-smokers compared with
never-smokers and non-susceptible never-smokers compared with susceptible never-
smokers

All Kerrods packs had the same warning on the pack front TEXT only (smoking kills)
and 1 of 3 ‘pictorial’ warnings on the reverse panel showing either a set of healthy and
diseased lungs, smoke in a child’s face or a text warning about seeking help. These were
2012 UK warnings
Average size HW for both types of packs: 30% on front and 40% on back
Outcomes
[Primary]: Consumption
[Secondary behavioural]: 5 measures: stub out cigarette, forego cigarette, smoking
around others, keep pack out of sight, cover pack
[Secondary non-behavioural]: thinking about quitting, wanting to quit, pack percep-
tions (not stylish, unfashionable, cheap, uncool, unattractive, poor quality, unappealing)
, feelings about smoking (satisfying, enjoyable, feeling good). For health warnings: notic-
ing, believability, seriousness, read more closely, thought about more. All measured on
5-point scales. Composite scores were derived for categories of responses (such as pack
perceptions, response to warnings), by summing the individual items and then rescaling
to a 5-point scale
Analysis summary: Paired t-tests were used to test for differences in mean reported
daily consumption while using the Kerrods pack versus their own pack. As the data on
avoidant/cessation behaviours were binary (yes/no) the McNemar test was used to test
for differences in response to the Kerrods pack versus their own pack. The number of
avoidant/cessation behaviours associated with each pack was also counted and paired
t-tests were used to test for differences in the mean number of actions taken with the
Kerrods pack versus their own pack. Analysis focused on comparing ratings between
branded and plain packs at different time points. For each time point, paired t-tests
were used to produce mean scores for the plain packs relative to mean scores for their
own packs. Wilcoxon signed rank test, a non-parametric procedure suited to paired data,
was used to test for significant differences between the ratings of plain packs versus the

Participants
43 young adults, average age 24.0 years, 67.4% (n = 29) were men, 67.1% (n = 28)
were smokers (14 weekly, 14 daily) were recruited from the general population via
advertisements around university precinct and surrounding area
Interventions
IV: branded vs standardised packs
Branded = Branded pack images were taken from the 10 popular cigarette brands in the
UK (Benson & Hedges, Lambert and Butler, Mayfair, Richmond, Silk Cut, Embassy,
Marlboro, Player’s Gold Leaf, Royals and Sterling)
Standardised (plain) = Standardised white pack images were taken from an example of a
standardised pack created for Action on Smoking and Health (England), and modified
to create 10 standardised pack images with the cigarette brand names described above
included as plain text. 10 different pictorial health warnings, selected at random from
those in use at that time on cigarette packs in the UK, were paired with each of branded
and standardised pack images, to create a total of 200 stimuli (100 branded, 100 stan-
dardised). These pictorial warnings were placed on the rear panel of packs in the UK at
that time. In this study they were placed on the front of the pack, as semantic content
(i.e. written health warnings) is known to capture visual attention preferentially
Outcomes
[Secondary behavioural]: Eye movements/fixations towards health warnings vs brand
information
Analysis summary: Only data from participants’ dominant eye were analysed, as is
standard practice. The eye-position data were analysed offline by an automatic saccade
detection procedure. A saccade was defined as a change in eye position with a minimum
velocity of 30 °/second, or a minimal acceleration threshold of 8000 °/second. A fixation
started after the velocity fell below this value for 5 successive samples. The primary
outcome was the number of saccades made to 2 regions of interest: (i) the lower part of
the cigarette packs comprising the health warning information (7.4 10.3 ° visual angle in
height and width, respectively), and (ii) the upper part of the cigarette pack comprising
brand information (10.4 x 10.3 ° of visual angle). A 3x2x2 mixed-model ANOVA of
number of saccades, with smoking status (non-smoker, weekly smoker, daily smoker)
as a between-participants factor, and package type (branded, plain) and location of eye
gaze (health warning, brand) as within-participants factors

Methods
Country: Australia
Setting: Online survey
Date: 3 survey waves: Wave 1, September 10 - 30 2012 (before standardised packaging)
; Wave 2, January 15 - February 7, 2013 (post); Wave 3, May 15 - June 9, 2013 (post)
Design: Longitudinal (pre- and two post-) study of population interventions -- media
campaign and standardised packaging. 2 follow-up waves within reasonable time frames
of the interventions. Wave 2 began ~1½ months after the new HWLs and standardised
packagingwasrequiredonall products,andduring/1weekafterthe massmediacampaign
aired for the first time. Wave 3 began ~5½ months after the new HWs and standardised
packaging was required on all products, and during the time the mass media campaign
was airing for the second time
Participants
2666 (wave 1 = 901; wave 2 = 887; wave 3 = 878) Australian adult smokers, aged
18+ years (although panel participants were selected to be broadly representative of key
consumer segments in Australia, the precise sampling frame is unknown). Recruited from
online consumer panel provided by Global Market Insights (GMI: www.gmi-mr.com)
: Recruited from commercial sampling frame and followed over time. Those lost to
follow-up were replenished to maintain a sample size of 1000 respondents at each wave.
Although panel participants were selected to be broadly representative of key consumer
segments in Australia, the precise sampling frame is unknown
Average age = 42 years. 1136 men (42.6%). All smokers
Interventions
IV: Pre-post study of actual standardised packs as implemented in Australia
Branded = original branded packs
Standardised (plain) = dark brown-green colour (Pantone 448C), with the brand name
in the same typeface (Lucida Sans) and font size and colour (Pantone Cool Gray 2C).
75% pictorial HW on front, 90% back
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: Self-reported measures of: 1) attention to warning labels
(’In last month, how often, if at all, have you noticed health warnings on cigarette
packages?’ And ‘In the last month, how often, if at all, have you read or looked closely at
the warning labels on cigarette packs?’ with 5-point scale options. Scores for the 2 items
were averaged to form a continuous variable (range 1 - 5); 2) talking about warning
labels measured with 3 items: ‘In the last month, how often have you talked to others
about the warning labels on cigarette packs?’, ‘In the last month, how often have your
family members spoken with you about the warning labels on cigarette packs?’, and ‘In
the last month, how often have other people besides your family spoken with you about
the warning labels on cigarette packs?’. Response options were ‘not at all’, ‘once’, ‘a few
times’, ‘often’, and ‘very often’. These 3 items were dichotomised (not at all versus the
rest) and then summed into a count variable (range 0 - 3) with higher numbers indicating
more talking about HWLs; and 3) Campaign recall, only assessed at waves 2 and wave 3
as there was no campaign at wave 1, using a single question: ‘In the last month, have you
seen any anti-smoking ads on television, which talked about the dangers of smoking?’,
with dichotomised responses (1 = ‘yes’, 0 = ‘no’, ‘don’t know’ or not asked)
Analysis summary: Chi2 tests were used to assess differences in sample characteristics
across waves and differences in the outcome measures (i.e. attention and talking about
HWs) between respondents who recalled the campaign and those who did not recall
the campaign. GEE analyses were performed to examine whether attention to and talk-
ing about HWLs changed over time and whether campaign recall was associated with

to HWLs as the outcome and Poisson GEE models were estimated when examining
talking about HWLs as the outcome. The exchangeable correlation structure was used
with robust variance estimators. The repeated measures variable was survey wave. All
GEE models adjusted for age, gender, education, income, daily versus non-daily smoker,
Heaviness of Smoking Index, quit intention, previous quit attempts, and time in sample.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted with weighted factors

Methods
Country: Australia
Setting: Participants were from communities served by 34 Aboriginal community-con-

ties were selected based on the population distribution of Aboriginal and Torrese Strait
Islander people by state or territory and remoteness
Date: April 2012 - October 2013
Design: Observational. Continuous cross-sectional surveys. Conducted before and after
standardised packaging was mandated (1 Dec 2012), treating the 3-month phase-in
period as “before”. (i.e. April - Nov 2012 vs Dec 2012 - Oct 2013)
Participants
1643 adult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smokers and recent quitters from the
communities described above (ex-smokers who quit ≤ 12 months ago), aiming for equal
numbers of men and women, and people aged 18 - 34 and 35+ years (average age 36.95
years; 795 men (48.4%); 848 women (41.6%). Participants are part of the Talking About
The Smokes (TATS) project which is a collaboration between research institutions and
ACCHSs and their state. Participants were recruited and surveyed via face-to-face. (N.

non-smokers and children), being very worried that smoking will damage the smoker’s
own health in the future, agreeing that mainstream society disapproves of smoking, and
wanting to quit
Analysis summary: How often respondents noticed warning labels (in the past month),
anti-tobacco news stories (in the past 6 months) and anti-tobacco advertising or informa-
tion(in the past 6 months) were assessed on a 5-point scale ranging from “never” to “very
often”, which was later collapsed to 3 categories (never, sometimes, often). Those asked
about warning labels were also asked about forgoing cigarettes: “Have the warning labels
stopped you from having a smoke when about to?”. Covariates included daily or non-
daily smoking status and sociodemographic indicators. Also assessed for variation ac-
cording to tobacco control activity that had occurred at the project site over the previous
year (whether there were dedicated tobacco control resources, and the number of media
used to communicate anti-tobacco advertising), which was determined in the project site
survey. Logistic regression was used to assess: (i) variation in health information recall
(often vs sometimes or never) by daily smoking status, sociodemographic variables, and
tobacco control activity at the project site; (ii) the association between health informa-
tion recall and the 4 main outcome measures; and (iii) variation in warning label recall
and outcomes before and after plain packaging was mandated. Stata 13 commands were
used to adjust for the sampling design, identifying the 35 project sites as clusters and
the quotas as strata. Data for health information recall were excluded for less than 2%
of participants due to missing or refused responses, and for less than 2% due to “don’t
know” responses. Questions about recall of warning labels were not asked of those who
had not smoked in the past month (n = 44), nor those surveyed at the first project site (n
= 26), after which questions were modified. These participants were therefore excluded
from logistic regression analyses, which controlled for recall of each other type of health
information, survey month (collapsed into 2-month blocks), daily smoking status and
other sociodemographic covariates. Regression analyses for wanting to quit excluded a
further 4.8% of smokers who responded “don’t know” to this question

IV: Experimental auctions.
4 HWL conditions, all with the same novel message (i.e. smoking causes mouth cancer)
, which was not at that time on US HWLs
Labelling option 1: text-only message that covered 50% of 1 side of the package (US
policy at that time);
Labelling option 2: text-only message that covered 50% of the lower half of the front,
back and 1 side of the package;
Labelling option 3: text message with pictorial image of mouth cancer, covering 50% of
the lower half of the front, back and 1 side of the package;
Labelling option 4: the same text and pictorial image as in condition 3, but with all
colour and symbolic brand elements removed (i.e. standardised packaging), aside from
the brand font, size, and descriptors
Eligible participants were randomly assigned to bid on packs of cigarettes with different
labelling options in 1 of 5 experimental manipulations:
1. Packs with labelling options 1 and 2
2. Packs with labelling options 1 and 3.
3. Packs with labelling option 2 and 3.
4. Packs with labelling option 2 and 4.
5. Two packs with a pictorial image. Labelling option 3 and 4
Each of these experimental manipulationsinvolvedrandomorderingof packpresentation
and bids
All 4 HWL conditions were affixed to the 3 most popular brands within major product
classes (i.e. Marlboro Red, Marlboro Lights, and Newport Menthol). At the beginning
of the study, participants indicated their preference for full flavour, light, or mentholated
cigarettes, and their subsequent participation involved bidding on the corresponding
most popular brand within this preferred class. In other words, each participant bid only
on Marlboro Red cigarettes, Marlboro Light cigarettes, or Newport Menthol cigarettes,
depending on their preference
Branded = labelling options 1 to 3.
Standardised (plain) = labelling option 4. The pack was a beige colour and the font of

pictorial labels and with standardised packaging relative to text-only warnings, as well as
to determine the factors that influence decreased demand. Both unconditional and con-

groups and with different smoking-related characteristics may be affected differently by
labelling alternatives. To examine the possible impact of demographic and smoking re-

Outcomes
[Primary]: Cigarette consumption between baseline and the 3 outcome periods. Daily,
weekly and monthly cigarette smokers were asked how many cigarettes they smoked per
day, week or month (respectively). For analysis, these were configured into cigarettes per
day
Analysis summary: Logistic and linear regression to assess changes between the pre-
standardised packaging period (April - September 2012; n = 2223) and 3 subsequent time
periods: the transition phase during which plain packages were being introduced into
the Australian market (October and November 2012; n = 776); standardised packaging
year 1 (December 2012 - November 2013; n = 4431); and standardised packaging post-
tax (December 2013 - March 2014; n = 1381). Linear regression used to assess changes
in daily cigarette consumption for daily, weekly and monthly cigarette or roll-your-own
smokers (configured into cigarettes per day). (Note: “All analyses were conducted in
Stata V.12.1, adjusting for the effects of sample weighting on parameter estimates and
SEs. In addition, an unconditional approach (ie, the ‘subpopulation’ command in Stata
V.12.1) was used to limit the sample as appropriate for each set of analyses, ensuring
correct estimation of the SEs.” All regression models controlled for sociodemographics.

Methods
Country: UK
Setting: City University, London
Date: August 2013
Design: This study used a factorial (2x3) within-participants design (but with partici-
pants randomised to different orders of conditions). 2 factors were varied: packaging style
and type of health warning. Eye-tracking study that compared branded vs standardised
within participants, with the 6 different warnings appearing on the 6 standardised and
the branded packs
Participants
30 never-smokers, (6 men (20%) and 24 women) aged between 19 and 40 years, mean
age 23 (SD 4.4) from City University London, UK. Most were full-time students. “Op-
portunity” recruitment (assume means opportunistic)
Interventions
IV: The visual stimuli were identically sized branded or standardized cigarette packages
Standardised (plain) = The appearance of the standardised pack images was based on
the current Australian guidelines: the colour selected was Pantone 448C, and a white
Helvetica typeface was used to denote the brand and brand variation
Branded = scanned copies of 6 popular brands currently available in the United Kingdom:
Benson & Hedges, Camel, Lambert & Butler, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, and Richmond
WARNINGS: In the UK, warnings currently appear at the bottom of the pack, and differ
in size between front and back. The authors opted to standardise all warnings to 40% of
the pack size, approximating European regulations at the time of testing. The 2 black &
white text warnings used were those currently employed on the front of cigarette packets
in the UK: ‘Smoking Kills’ and ‘Smoking seriously harms you and others around you.
’ The design implied matching these 2 black & white warnings with the same number
of colour text and colour image & text warnings. Given that there are 15 colour health
warnings currently in use on the back of cigarette packs in the UK (4 colour text and 11
colour image & text), 2 colour text and 2 colour image & text warnings were selected
based on a pilot study
Outcomes
[Secondary behavioural]: A model TX300 video eye tracker (Tobii Technology AB,
Danderyd, Sweden) recorded eye gaze data from both eyes simultaneously at 120 Hz (i.
e. 8.3 ms per sample). Gaze position was the mean proportion of a 5-second viewing
period spent gazing at the warning level region of the images of the cigarette packets
Analysis summary: Data for each participant was copied to SPSS in order to assess
group trends which were analysed with factorial (2x3) ANOVA using the general linear
model repeated measures routine. The ANOVA tested the main effects of packaging style
and warning type and the interaction between them. Greenhouse-Geisser corrections
were applied for violations of sphericity. The statistical significance for each category of
warning label alone was tested (via t-tests) in addition to factorial analysis

Notes
Note: not all participants saw the same warnings, but these were not always viewed on the
same brands of standardised and branded: In the main experiment, each participant saw
the selected 6 warnings twice each, once on a branded pack and once on the standardised
version of that same pack. To counter any associations between particular brands and
particular warnings, a Latin square was used to generate 6 different possible pairings of the
6 brands with the 6 warning labels. Then participants were rotated through these pairings
in counter-balanced sets of 6, thus ensuring that each warning appeared equally often
with each brand across the full sample of participants to investigate whether standardised
cigarette packaging increases the time spent looking at health warnings, regardless of the
format of those warnings
“Participants were told that the aim of the study was to examine attitudes towards
cigarette packaging”

Methods
Country: Australia
Setting: online
Date: November, 2007
Design: This study employed a 3 (brand types) x6x4 (degree of standardised packaging)
between-participants experimental design using an internet online method to expose adult
smokers to 1 randomly selected cigarette pack, after which respondents completed ratings
of the pack
Participants
Panel originally sourced from various methods, including telephone interviews, face-to-face
market research. Panel members emailed with web link to survey, given chance to win 1 of
10 shopping vouchers as incentive to participate. Adults aged 18 - 49 years old, smoked at
least weekly. The panel was broadly representative of Australian Bureau of Statistics norms
in relation to geographical location, income and age. 813 smokers: 309 men (38%), 504
women (62%). 81% aged 30 years or older
Interventions
IV: 4 packs, 1 branded and 3 standardised. The brand types were the 3 most popular
Australian brand variants among adult smokers (Winfield Blue 25s; Peter Jackson Rich 30s;
Longbeach Rich 40s)
Standardised (plain): All standardised packs in generic pack of cardboard brown colour
previously demonstrated to elicit Negative responses. 3 variations 1: maintains a branded
font (i.e. original font size, style and position) and positioning of brand/descriptor; 2: brand
name in a standard font in a prominent position on the pack with descriptor information
in a standard font at the bottom; 3: brand name in a smaller standard font positioned at the
bottom and “(xx number) cigarettes” in a larger font in a prominent position on the pack.
Standardised pack 3 was the plainest
Branded = Original pack (available for purchase at time of study)
All pack conditions had the same graphic health warning visible on the top of the face of
the pack as required by Australian Government legislation
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: asked to rate the cigarette pack they were shown in relation
to: brand image (the mental associations that are stimulated by the pack’s appearance alone);
smoker attributions (anticipated personality/character type of the typical person who might
be expected to regularly smoke the pack displayed); and inferred smoking experience (the
type of smoking experience which might be anticipated from a cigarette contained in the
displayed pack). When viewing the cigarette pack, respondents were asked to rate the fol-
lowing phrases describing attributes of the cigarette pack shown from 0 (not at all well) to
10 (extremely well). (For analysis, dichotomised to 0 - 4 and 5 - 10) “This pack …”: “is a

popular brand among smokers”; “has an attractive looking pack”; “is good value for money”;
“is an exclusive/expensive brand”; and “is a brand you might try/smoke”. Looking at the
same pack, respondents were then asked to rate a number of attributes of typical smokers of
the pictured cigarette pack from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely well). “A typical smoker of
this pack is …”: “trendy/stylish”; “young”; “masculine”; “lower class”; “sociable/outgoing”;
“older/ mature”; and “confident/successful”. Finally, looking at the same pack, respondents
were asked to think about how a cigarette from the pictured pack might taste, and to rate
the following descriptions on how well they relate to the pack shown from 0 (not at all)
to 10 (extremely). “These cigarettes would taste …”: “rich in tobacco flavour”; “low in tar
and nicotine”; “of cheap tobacco”; “satisfying”; “like a light cigarette”; “of the highest quality
tobacco”; and “harsh on the throat”. Within each of the questions, attributes were presented
randomly to avoid order effects
Analysis summary: Eligible respondents were randomly allocated to view 1 of 12 pack
conditions that varied by brand and extent of plain packaging. All pack conditions had
the same graphic health warning visible on the top of the face of the pack. After viewing
their assigned pack, respondents completed ratings of the pack in relation to perceived
attributes of the brand, perceived attributes of smokers of the brand and expected taste/
quality of the cigarette. The assigned pack was present on the screen as the smoker completed
each of the ratings. Shown different images of packs and asked to rate them on a variety
of elements (cigarette packs on attractiveness, brand imagery characteristics and, perceived
sensory attributes)“. Respondents were asked to rate the cigarette pack they were shown in
relation to: brand image (the mental associations that are stimulated by the pack’s appearance
alone); smoker attributions (anticipated personality/character type of the typical person who
might be expected to regularly smoke the pack displayed); and inferred smoking experience
(the type of smoking experience which might be anticipated from a cigarette contained in
the displayed pack). When viewing the cigarette pack, respondents were asked to rate the
following phrases describing attributes of the cigarette pack shown from 0 (not at all well)
to 10 (extremely well)

might be familiar. Respondents were given a chance to win 1 of 10 AUD 100 shopping
vouchers as an incentive
1203 participants. 538 men (44.7%)
Interventions
IV: different sized health warnings and standardised vs branded packs
3 pictorial health warning sizes: 30% vs. 70% or 100%. 3 current Australian graphic
health warnings that had evaluated strongly in a government evaluation were included:
‘Smoking causes peripheral vascular disease’; ‘Smoking causes throat and mouth cancer’;
and ‘Smoking harms unborn babies’
Branding = Within their assigned pack condition, each respondent was exposed to 6
different brands to improve generalisability of results. These brands were the 2 most pop-
ular ‘mainstream’ Australian brands (Peter Jackson Rich and Winfield Blue), the 2 most
popular ‘value’ brands (Horizon Blue and Longbeach Rich), the most popular ‘premium’
brand (Benson & Hedges Smooth) and the largest-selling international brand (Marlboro
Red). In total, 216 separate digital images of packs were created in Adobe Photoshop,
manipulating branding/ plainness, size of health warning and specific warning message,
presented across 6 different brands
Standardised = Brown real pack
Respondents were allocated randomly to view 1 of 6 pack conditions that varied by size
(30%, 70% or 100%) of front-of-pack pictorial health warning and presence/absence
of branding. After random assignment to 1 of these pack conditions, participants con-
secutively viewed and rated 6 cigarette brands within their pack condition - 3 current
health warnings were included on the packs. In total, 216 separate digital images of packs
were created in Adobe Photoshop, manipulating branding/plainness, warning size and
specific warning message, presented across 6 different brands
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: Positive pack characteristics: (combined measure from:
popular among smokers, attractive, sophisticated, brand you might try/smoke); positive
smoker characteristics: (combined measure from: trendy, successful); negative smoker
characteristics (boring); positive taste characteristics: (combined measure from: enjoyable
to smoke, satisfying in taste); negative harm characteristics (combined measure from:
high in tar, harmful to your health). Attitudes to smoking were ‘How much do you feel
like having a cigarette right now?’ and ‘How much do you feel like quitting today?’ and
‘How likely are you to be smoking cigarettes a year from now’ and ’I regret having started
smoking’, ’The health effects of smoking are exaggerated’, ’I get a lot of pleasure out of
smoking’, ’Smoking is a disgusting habit’. ’Which pack would you be most tempted to
buy?’
Analysis summary: When viewing each brand, respondents were asked to rate it on
visual analogue scales from 0 (‘not at all well’) to 10 (‘extremely well’) on a number
of attributes. To assess effects on these rating outcomes, 2-way ANOVAs examined the
main effects of pack plainness and size of pictorial health warning, and interactions
between plainness and size of PHW. Main effects of age group (18-29 years versus 30 +
years) on pack ratings were also assessed using ANOVAs, including interactions between
age and plainness of pack, age and warning size, and a 3-way interaction between age,
plainness of pack and warning size. Main and interaction effects of plainness of pack
and warning size on purchase intent, attitudes toward smoking and smoking intentions
were investigated by logistic regression analysis. Where multiple pairwise comparisons
were conducted, Bonferroni adjustments were made

Methods
Country: Australia
Setting: State of Victoria
Date: Nov 2012 - Dec 2012
Design: Cross-sectional survey via computer-assisted telephone interviews
Participants
Representative sample of adults aged 18 years and over, residing in the general population
of the Australian state of Victoria; current smokers of cigarettes, pipes and/or cigars
(daily, weekly or less than weekly. RYO could also be included. All had to have a usual
brand of cigarettes that they were or had used prior to the intro of plain packaging (72.
3% were smoking from a plain pack and 27.7% were smoking from a branded pack)
Part of Victorian Smoking and Health Survey - cross-sectional telephone survey under-
taken annually. Computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted using a dual-
frame survey design incorporating samples generated by random-digit dialling to land-
line and mobile phones. In 45% of cases where it was possible to match landline phone
numbers to residential addresses, primary approach letters were posted prior to the phone
call to give notice of a ‘community survey of health attitudes and behaviours’
536 participants, average age 40.2 years, 303 men (56.6%)
Interventions
IV: Branded vs standardised
Branded = Own regular pack brand: Branded pack used by participants. (30% front of
pack graphic health warnings)
Standardised (plain) = Dark brown-green colour (Pantone 448C), with the brand name
in the same typeface (Lucida Sans) and font size and colour (Pantone Cool Gray 2C).
75% pictorial HW on front, 90% on back
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: thinking about quitting, seriously considering quitting,
planning to quit, quitting priority, harm perceptions (frequency of thinking about harm
your smoking might be doing to you and would you agree dangers of smoking have been
exaggerated), brand satisfaction, brand quality
Analysis summary: First compared the characteristics of those smoking from standard-
ised and branded packs using bivariate logistic regression for binary variables and analysis
of variance for continuous outcomes. Variables associated with standardised or branded
pack use at P < 0.25 were included as covariates in multivariate logistic regression analyses
to examine whether current possession of a standardised pack compared with a branded
pack was associated with the above outcome measures and in analysis of covariance to
determine if smoking from a standardised pack was associated with higher ratings of
quitting as a life priority. A third set of models additionally controlled for the propor-
tion of the sample interviewed during each survey week who reported smoking from
a standardised pack. Did this to control for the extent to which, as the survey period
progressed, smokers would have been increasingly exposed to plain packs in their social
networks, even though they may not have been personally smoking from one. Finally,
in a sensitivity analysis, repeated all analyses for brand-loyal smokers, defined as those
who had been smoking the same brand for a year. (Model 1: SES, daily consumption
levels, recalled at least 1 anti-smoking advertisement, brand segment and previous quit
attempts; Model 2: SES, daily consumption levels, recalled at least 1 antismoking ad-
vertisement, brand segment, previous quit attempts, covariates, proportion of sample
smoking from a plain pack each week of the interview)

2012) and 1 year after full implementation (December 2012 - November 2013))
Design: Observational.continuous cross-sectional surveys
Participants
7175 cigarette smokers (weighted; unweighted n = 7133). 149 respondents who did not
provide valid data on all demographic covariates were excluded. Men: 3933 participants
(Pre: n = 1191 (55%); Transition: n = 416 (55%); 1-year: n = 2326 (55%)). Women:

year 1)), a series of unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analysis were used
[Secondary non-behavioural]: As a general measure of overall appeal, the extent to
which respondents liked the look of their current pack was rated on a 5-point scale
from ‘strongly agree’ to ‘strongly disagree’ (dichotomised into disagree/strongly disagree
vs neither/agree/strongly agree). Smokers were also asked to rate their current cigarettes
or tobacco as ‘higher’, ‘lower’ or ‘about the same’ compared with a year ago, in terms of
quality, satisfaction, value for money and appeal of the packaging (coded as lower than
a year ago vs higher/about the same). Additionally, smokers were asked whether or not
there were differences between brands in prestige (no vs yes/do not know) and on a 4-
point scale from ‘not at all different’ to ‘very different’, how different cigarette brands
were in taste (not at all different vs a little/somewhat/very different/do not know)
Analysis summary: All adjusted models included HSI, demographic characteristics, re-
cent antismoking campaign activity and change in cigarette price as covariates. Data were
weighted to account for telephony status (landline or mobile phone), gender, age by edu-
cation and state of residence (see Supplementary Technical report). All statistical analyses
were conducted using Stata V.12.1 using weighted data (using the svy command with ‘p’
weights). In addition, an unconditional approach (i.e. the ‘subpopulation’ command in
Stata V.12.1) was used to limit the sample as appropriate for each set of analyses, ensur-
ing correct estimation of the SEs. To test whether outcomes differed between 3 phases
of plain packaging implementation (pre- (referent), transition and during standardised
packaging (PP year 1)), a series of unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analysis. All
adjusted models included HSI, demographic characteristics, recent antismoking cam-
paign activity and change in cigarette price as covariates. Interactions were tested between
phase (pre- vs PP year 1) and age (18 - 29; 30 - 49; 50 - 69 years), sex and SES (low,
mid and high) for all outcomes. For the post-year 1 phase, the form of change over time
was assessed by examining adjusted regression models that included linear and quadratic
terms for month. The presence of a significant linear term within post-year 1 indicates a
significant linear increase (or decrease) within the year, while the additional presence of
a significant quadratic term signifies the increase (or decrease) was curvilinear over the
months, that is, that it reached a peak (or trough) and then declined (increased) again.
Finally, sensitivity testing examined whether the inclusion season variables influenced
the pattern of observed findings in adjusted models

tors vs branded pack
Branded = 10 female-oriented brands were selected for the current study, including 4 brands
sold in Brazil (Virginia Slims Silver, Dunhill Carlton - Carlton Mint Blend, Vogue Bleue
and Marlboro Gold Original), and 6 other leading international cigarette brands (Peel Sweet
Melon, John Player Special Pink, Benson & Hedges Superslims Park Avenue, DJ Mix Straw-
berry Flavor, Silk Cut Superslims Menthol, and Capri Baunilha). Brands were purposely
selected to feature different colour descriptors (silver, gold, blue, and pink) and flavour de-
scriptors (baunilha/vanilla, strawberry, mint, sweet melon, and menthol), as well as other
descriptors such as superslims. Packages that featured “traditional” female colour schemes,
including the use of pink, light green, light blue, and white, as well as smaller pack shapes,
were also selected
Standardised(plain)=Condition2:Brown“plain”packages:the same packageswith all brand
imagery removed, including colours and graphics, but with brand descriptors maintained;
or Condition 3: “plain-no descriptors” packages: the same packages with both descriptors
and imagery removed
Portuguese text was digitally added to packages with English-only text to ensure that par-
ticipants who could only read Portuguese would be able to distinguish the packages in the
standardised condition and the standardised-no descriptors condition. Since pictorial health
warning labels are only shown on the back side of the package in Brazil, these were not
visible to the participants in any of the images shown. The order in which the packages were
viewed was counter-balanced across participants
Outcomes
[Secondary non-behavioural]: Brand ratings Participants were asked to rate each of the
10 packages “compared to other brands you can buy in stores” on 4 measures: 1) brand
appeal; 2) perceived taste; 3) health risk; and 4) smoothness. Responses were provided on a
5-point Likert scale (e.g. 1 = “A lot more appealing” to 5 = “A lot less appealing”) and were
subsequently recoded into a binary variable as either a 1 (“a little”/“a lot more appealing”) or
0 (“a little”/“a lot less appealing” and “no difference”). A summary index rating was created
for each of the 4 brand rating measures, by summing scores across the 10 packages to yield
a score between 0 and 10, where the number corresponded to the total number of packs
rated as more appealing/better taste/less harmful/ smoother on the throat. Pack selection

for completing the survey, they could, if they wished, select a pack they would like to be

sent from a choice of 4 cigarette packages shown on the screen. Participants were shown 4
packages: 2 branded packages and 2 standardised packages, regardless of the condition they
were assigned to earlier in the survey. Packs were drawn at random from those displayed
previously. The participants had the option to select 1 of the 4 packages shown, or select an “I
do not wish to receive a package” option, prominently displayed on the screen. Immediately
after making their selection, the participants were informed that no packages would be
mailed as the investigators did not want to endorse smoking
Analysis summary: Chi2 tests were used to assess differences in key sociodemographic
factors between experimental conditions. Logistic regression models were used to examine
the effect of the experimental conditions for single packages on the 4 brand attributes, and
to examine the extent to which participants selected a pack (branded or plain) in the pack
selection task. Linear regression models were used to examine the effect of the experimental
conditions on each of the 4 brand attribute and 6 smoker image index variables, including
the overall “positive smoker image index”

Outcomes
First publication
[Secondary behavioural]: Students indicated how frequently they had not had a
cigarette because of the warnings
[Secondary non-behavioural]: thinking about quitting; cognitive processing of warn-
ings: how frequenty participants: read; paid close attention to; thought about and talked
about the warning labels using a 5-point scale: (1) ‘never’; (2) ‘once or twice’; (3) ‘some-
times’; (4) ‘often’ and (5) ‘every time I see them.’ In addition, students indicated how fre-
quently they had not had a cigarette because of the warnings. Students who had smoked
in the previous 12 months were asked how frequently they thought about quitting smok-
ing because of the warnings. Perceptions of the health consequences of smoking: In both
surveys, students were presented with the same list of 18 items and asked to indicate
whether they agreed or disagreed that they were caused by smoking, using a 5-point
Likert scale
Analysis summary: Data from students who had seen a cigarette pack in the previous
6 months were used. Logistic regression analyses compared proportions across the 2
surveys. Linear regression analyses examined change in the cognitive processing variables
between the surveys

[Secondary non-behavioural]: 1) Brand character ratings: students were presented
with a photographic image of each of 4 brands of Australian cigarettes and asked to
include their level of agreement with 3 statements about the brand and the pack: this
brand appeals to me, the pack looks good, the pack looks ugly; 3 statements about
people who smoke the brand: are cool, are successful, are daggy (uncool). Responses on
a 5-point scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree with ’not sure’ in the
middle. Brands were 3 most commonly smoked by Australian adolescents (Winfield,
Peter Jackson, Longbeach) and a premium brand (B&H) which was fifth most commonly
smoked in 2011. All images included a GHW as mandated at that time, with the same
health warning used for each pack image within a survey year (eg, ‘Smoking causes mouth
and throat cancer’ in 2011; ‘Smoking causes mouth cancer’ in 2013). For each brand,
responses for the 6 items were summed with items recoded where necessary such that
higher scores indicated a positive view (range 6 - 30). (Cronbach’s α for each brand in
each year was adequate: 2011 range: 0.77 - 0.78; 2013 range: 0.73 - 0.75). 2) Attraction
of cigarette packs (appeal outcome): indicated their level of agreement to 4 positive
(‘cool’, ‘good’, ‘interesting’, ‘exciting’),and 4 negative (‘ugly’, ‘daggy (uncool)’, ‘gross’,
disgusting’) descriptions of cigarette packs using a 5-point scale. Students could also
respond that they ‘cannot comment’ with these responses coded as missing. Positive and
negative subscale scores were created by taking the average of the 5-point ratings for the
items on each scale. Both scales have good internal reliability with internal reliability for
the current study high (positive pack image scale: α = 0.85; negative pack image scale:
α = 0.78)
Brand differences (harm and appeal outcomes): extent to which standardised pack-
aging may be associated with a reduction in perceived differences in brands in harm and
harm-related outcomes, as well as 1 appeal outcome. Students indicated their level of
agreement to 5 statements reflecting that some brands of cigarettes are: ‘easier to smoke
than others’, ‘more addictive than others’, ‘easier to quit than others’, ‘have more harmful
substances in them than others’ and ‘have better looking packs than others’. Students
could also give a ‘don’t know’ (5) response. Items were recoded into 3 categories: ‘strongly
agree/agree’, ‘strongly disagree/disagree’ and ‘don’t know’
Analysis summary: Analyses focus on data from students aged 12 - 17 years as this is
the typical age range for secondary students in Australia. To correct for any oversampling
or undersampling of students within age, sex and education sector groups, data were
weighted to reflect the number of male and female students of each age enrolled in each
education section in each state in each survey year. Analyses adjusted for clustering of
students within schools and robust SEs were used. Generalised linear regression models
tested the change in scores across survey years for brand character ratings and positive
and negative pack image ratings. Multinomial logistic regression examined change in the
distribution of responses for the 3-level categorical variables assessing brand differences.
Smoking status, age, sex, school education sector and state were included as covariates in
analyses examining effect of year. When the effect of year was significant, its interaction
with smoking status was fitted to determine if the effect was consistent across smoking
status groups. Students with missing data on variables were excluded from relevant
analyses. Examined whether adjusting for parental consent procedures and parental and
friend smoking altered the pattern of results by repeating all analyses controlling for these
variables

Outcomes
[Secondary behavioural]: forgoing cigarettes and avoidance behaviours
[Secondary non-behavioural]: 1) quit intentions. At each wave, assessed smokers’
quit intentions using the question: “Are you planning to quit smoking-within the next
month, within the next 6 months, sometime in the future beyond 6 months, or are you
not planning to quit?”.2) HWL salience. Assessed using 2 questions: “In the last month,
how often, if at all, have you noticed the warning labels on cigarette packages?”; and
“In the last month, how often, if at all, have you read or looked closely at the warning
labels on cigarette packages?”, both rated on a 5-point response scale from ‘never’ to ‘very
often’. Initial exploratory analyses indicated that the policy changes had different effects
on the 2 measures, thus they were used as separate measures rather than combined into
a scale. 3) HWL cognitive reactions. Assessed using 3 questions: “To what extent, if at
all, do the warning labels make you think about the health risks of smoking?”; “To what
extent, if at all, do the warning labels on cigarette packs make you more likely to quit
smoking?”; “In the past 6 months, have warning labels on cigarette packages led you to
think about quitting?”. The first 2 questions had response options: “Not at all, A little,
Somewhat, and A lot” and the last one had: “Not at all, Somewhat, and Very much.”
Responses to the 3 questions were combined into a scale by averaging them. 4) HWL
behavioural reactions. Assessed using 2 questions, 1 assessing forgoing behaviour: “In
the last month, have the warning labels stopped you from having a cigarette when you
were about to smoke one?” (Never, Once, A few times, Many times); and the other
assessing avoidance behaviour “In the last month have you made any effort to avoid
looking at or thinking about the warning labels-such as covering them up, keeping them
out of sight, using a cigarette case, avoiding certain warnings, or any other means?” (Yes/
No)
N.B. Attentional orientation (AO) When you look at a cigarette pack, what do you
usually notice first-the warning labels, or other aspects of the pack, such as branding?”

Analysis summary: Smokers’ reactions and avoidance orientation (AO) to health warn-
ings (HWLs) pre-implementation and post-implementation of the standardised pack-
aging and enhanced health warnings law, were computed for descriptive purposes using
weighted data. GEE models were employed to examine pre-post changes by testing for
significant main effect of survey wave while controlling for sociodemographic and smok-
ing-related variables. Dichotomous outcome variables such as avoidance and AO were
modelled using binomial distribution with logit link function. Outcome variables such
as noticing, reading, cognitive reactions, forgoing and quit intentions were treated as
quasilinear and modelled as continuous variables using Gaussian distribution with iden-
tity link function as initial exploration indicated that these variables when dichotomised
were less sensitive in detecting an effect due to loss of information. Parameters were es-
timated using unstructured correlation structure with robust variance estimation proce-
dure. GEE modelling of pre-post changes was limited to smokers only (both recontacted
and newly-recruited smokers) at both survey waves, as ex-smokers are less likely to be
exposed to the pack HWLs. To examine whether the pre-post changes differed by AO
patterns, difference scores were employed as outcomes and linear regression analyses con-
ducted (since the difference scores were generally normally distributed) to test for group
differences in outcomes by regressing the difference scores onto a dummy variable used
to represent the 4 different patterns of change across waves in AO towards the HWLs
(i.e. brand-brand; brand-warning; warning-brand and warning-warning). For ease of
interpretation, a relevant subgroup was chosen as the reference group for comparison
purposes. This set of analyses included only smokers who provided data on both survey
waves. To assess effects of attrition, baseline differences were examined in covariates be-
tween those retained and lost and found those lost to the study were more likely to be
highly educated, complete a phone survey and be recruited into the study in the year
before the baseline wave. These variables were controlled for in all regression analyses.
Finally, additional GEE analyses were conducted to examine associations of upstream
HWL reactions and AO with warning-stimulated cognitive reactions (midstream out-
come) and quit intentions (downstream outcome), to determine whether the strength of
the associations differed between pre-policy and post-policy implementation by testing
for any significant interactions between survey year and reactions on the outcome of
interest

Country: Australia
Setting: Analysed phone call logs to National Quitline in New South Wales and the

Date: April 2004 - 28 February 2006; and 1 March 2006 - 31 March 2013 Call data
from 1 April 2004 - 28 February 2006 were provided by Macquarie Telecom (Sydney,

Design: Interrupted time-series design
Participants
Quitline is a free resource that can be used by smokers who are motivated and seeking
support to quit. Calls from NSW and ACT were involved
Interventions

Branded = own brands
Standardised (plain) = Dark brown-green colour (Pantone 448C), with the brand name
in the same typeface (Lucida Sans) and font size and colour (Pantone Cool Gray 2C).
75% pictorial HW on frton, 90% on back
Outcomes
[Secondary behavioural]: Calls to Quitline (indirect measure of quit attempts)
Analysis summary: As the data for weekly number of calls to the Quitline were auto-
correlated (each value was correlated with the previous value) autoregressive integrated
moving average (ARIMA) analysis in SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc) were used.
ARIMA models enabled the investigation of changes over time while accounting for
seasonal variation and background trends in such things as the effects of television anti-
tobacco advertising, changes in cigarette pricing relative to weekly earnings and num-
ber of smokers in the community. In ARIMA modelling, comprising model investiga-
tion, estimation and diagnostic checking, the methods of Box et al (Appendix; online at
mja.com.au) were followed. A single model fitted to the entire 7-year period of Quitline
call data did not meet technical criteria for model fit. Therefore, separate models that
included data for 12 months before and 6 months after each intervention (1 March 2005
- 1 September 2006 and 1 October 2011 - 1 April 2013) were fitted, as this was the
longest duration of follow-up for tobacco plain packaging available at the time of the
study

have many popular cafés, restaurants and bars. Fieldworkers sampled every venue in their
assigned café strip/s which had outdoor seating visible from the footpath. New venues
were added to the sample if they had opened between phases. 520 unique venues of
which 480 venues allowed smoking and had patrons present at least once in either phase.
At least 1 patron was present for 2391 observations pre-PP and for 2219 observations
post-PP (total n = 4610)
Interventions
Branded = pre-PP
, branded packs and 30% front-of-pack warnings and 90% back-of-
pack warnings.
Standardised (plain) = 75% front-of-pack warnings and 90% back-of-pack warnings.
Set of 14 HW: Dark brown-green colour (Pantone 448C), with the brand name in the
same typeface (Lucida Sans) and font size and colour (Pantone Cool Gray 2C).
New set of 14 warnings divided into 2 sets to be rotated after 12 months (so 7 new
warnings during the post- phase of this study)
Outcomes
[Secondary behavioural): At each café strip venue, fieldworkers recorded observations
using notepads/smartphone data collection applications, including:
(1) number of people smoking or holding/rolling/lighting a cigarette. Package display
was recorded slightly differently in each phase
Pre-standardised packaging , fieldworkers noted:
(2) number of packages visible on the table;
(3) number of packages orientated (a) face-down; (b) standing on their side, top or
bottom; (c) in a case or tin (not the original packaging); (d) completely concealed by a
telephone, wallet or some other object, so that the fieldworker was unable to ascertain its
orientation; (e) with an unknown orientation (i.e. too far away/inadvertently obscured)
Post-standardised packaging phase: fieldworkers noted the same things, but separately
for fully-branded packs, PPs and packs of unknown packaging. 5c - 5e classified as
unknown packaging
Analysis summary: Multi-level Poisson models were employed to test the effect of phase
(pre- or post-standardised packaging) on the prevalence of pack display among patrons.
Random intercepts were included for café strip and venue in all models to adjust SEs for
correlations among observations within the same venue and among venues within the
same café strip. In order to analyse the data as the rate of packs to patrons, the count
of patrons was used as an offset term, meaning that for an observation (i.e. 1 for each
venue in each wave) to be included in the analysis at least 1 patron had to be present.
The rates of smokers to patrons and packs to active smokers were tested similarly, using
appropriate offset terms (patrons and active smokers, respectively). The analysis of packs
to active smokers excluded observations where no active smokers were recorded, due to
the offset term. For each outcome, unadjusted models were first run, followed by models
adjusting for city, SES, presence of children, month, day/time, temperature and wind
speed. A series of analyses were then conducted (using the adjusted models) to examine
interactions between phase and city, SES, presence of children and day/time to determine
whether or not the rates of packs to patrons and smokers to patrons changed more
between phases in some situations than others. To determine whether any effects were
absent in October/November (when plain packs were first emerging onto the market)
but present or stronger in December onwards (when all packs sold were required to be
plainly packaged), a 2-category variable was also created for month, comparing October/
November to December-April observations, and tested its interaction with phase. Multi-
level Poisson models were then used to examine whether phase had any effect on face-up

packorientation, concealmentorexternal case use.Comparedrates of face-up orientation
and pack concealment among fully-branded packs pre-standardised packaging to rates
among plain packs post-standardised packaging, excluding packs in external cases and
packs in unknown orientations from the total count of packs pre-standardised packaging
to ensure that rates had comparable denominators in both phases. Only observations
for which at least 1 known-orientation fully-branded (pre- PP) or plain (post-PP) pack
was recorded were included in these analyses due to the offset term. The rate of case
use was analysed for all observed packs in both phases, because the authors could not
determine whether the original package was fully branded or standardised; accordingly,
at least one pack had to be observed for an observation to be included in the analysis.
Interactions between phase and covariates were also examined. A sensitivity analysis was
then conducted, limiting the sample to venues which were open for business in both
the pre- and post-PP phases. The analytical procedure mirrored the steps for the main
analysis

Methods
Country: Australia
Setting: 2 cities: 18 suburbs in Melbourne and 7 Adelaid. Outdoor tables at café, restau-
rant, and bars
Date: January - April 2012 (pre- standardised packaging), mid-October 2012 - mid-
April 2013 (early post-standardised packaging) and mid-January - mid-April 2014 (1
year post-standardisec packaging)
Design: Observational pre-post standardised packaging study
Participants
No recruitment of participants: passive observation only. Selection of locations: For the
pre-PP phase, street segments were selected (referred to as ‘café strips’) from a range of
socioeconomic areas in Melbourne and Adelaide that were known to have many popular
cafés, restaurants and bars. Fieldworkers sampled every venue in their assigned café strip/
s which had outdoor seating visible from the footpath. New venues were added to the
sample if they had opened between phases. 585 unique venues were observed over the
course of the study, of which 519 venues had patrons present at least once. Patrons
were present at a total of 3947 observations: pre-standardised packaging ( n = 1340);
early post-standardised packaging ( n = 1296); 1 year post-standardised packaging (n =
1311). Fewer venue observations were used in analyses of the rates of packs to active
smokers (n = 1195), face-up and concealed packs to known-orientation branded (pre-)
or standardised (post-) packs (n = 1381), and external cases to all packs (n = 1470)
Interventions
Branded = pre-, branded packs and 30% front-of-pack warnings and 90% back-of-pack
warnings remained.
Standardised (plain) = 75% front-of-pack warnings and 90% back-of-pack warnings.
Set of 14 HW. Dark brown-green colour (Pantone 448C), with the brand name in the
same typeface (Lucida Sans) and font size and colour (Pantone Cool Gray 2C).
New set of 14 warnings divided into 2 sets to be rotated after 12 months (so 7 new
warnings during the post- phase of this study)
Outcomes
[Secondary behavioural]: Rate of pack display on café tables
Similar to Zacher 2014 (267), at each venue, fieldworkers recorded observations using
notepads/smartphone data collection applications, including counting: the number of
seated patrons, patrons smoking, holding or lighting a cigarette (‘active smokers’), and
tobacco packs, noting the pack type in the post-standardised packaging phases (branded,
standardised or unknown). They also recorded whether children were present, how many
packs were oriented face-up with the brand name and variant visible, face-down, standing
or on their side or concealed by an object like a wallet or phone (by pack type), and how
many packs were in an unknown orientation due to distance or an external case (not
recorded by pack type)
Analysis summary: Data from the 5 waves in each of the 3 phases that were conducted
between January and April. Preliminary analyses confirmed that restricting the pre-
standardised packaging and early post-standardised packaging periods to the 5 waves
of data did not substantially change the results from those previously published for
these periods. Multilevel Poisson models were employed in Stata 12.14 to test whether
outcomes of interest 1 year post-standardised packaging were different from pre- and
early post- phases. Bonferroni-adjusted P values to account for multiple comparisons
were carried out. Random intercepts were included for café strip and venue in all models
to adjust SEs for correlations among venues within the same café strip and for multiple
observations over time within the same venue. All models adjusted for city, area SES

using an Index of Relative Disadvantage, presence of children, month, day and time,
temperature, and wind speed. To analyse outcomes as rates, offset terms were used.
Number of patrons was the offset term for the rates of packs to patrons and smokers to
patrons; at least 1 patron had to be recorded for an observation to be analysed. Similarly,
number of smokers was the offset for the rate of packs to smokers, and only observations
with 1 or more smokers present were included. Rates of face-up orientation and pack
concealment among branded packs pre- were compared to rates among standardised
packs post-. Only observations for which at least 1 known-orientation branded (pre-)
or plain (early or 1-year post-standardised packaging) pack was recorded were analysed.
The rate of external case use was analysed out of all observed packs; accordingly, at least
1 pack had to be observed to be analysed. Also tested whether declines in pack display
and active smoking among patrons between pre- and 1-year post- were again greater
in venues with children present than in those without. Finally, sensitivity analyses were
conducted to assess whether excluding venues which were not observed in all 3 phases
altered the results

We had originally planned to conduct two reviews of standardised packaging, one looking at its impact on current users and one
looking at its impact on uptake in non-users. However, we subsequently decided to merge the two reviews, given that many relevant
studies and outcomes addressed both groups of participants. We therefore merged the two protocols and published a new one, namely
McNeill 2016.
As set out in McNeill 2016, we had originally planned to assess all outcomes to investigate any differences based on demographics
(gender, age, socio-economic status, ethnicity). However, due to the volume of data and heterogeneity between included studies this was
not feasible. Secondary analyses stemming from this review could include such variables. In addition, we made the following changes:
deletion of several databases listed in the search methods section (e.g. Conference Papers Index, Index to Theses (UK and Ireland))
which had been erroneously entered into the protocol; providing further detail on our methods for assessing non-randomized studies;
and change in the outcomes presented in the summary of findings table from “all outcomes” to “primary outcomes and change in quit
attempts.”
Finally, in the full review, we also clarified some points that were not clear in the initial protocol but which we had planned from the
outset. First, we added the statement that studies had to have measured at least one primary or secondary outcome to be included in
the review. Secondly, we explicitly list additional types of secondary outcomes (eye tracking; actual purchase or selection of tobacco
that participants believed that they would receive; craving). Thirdly, we clarified that outcomes were measured according to methods
of individual studies
