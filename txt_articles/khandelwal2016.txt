E
mergency tracheal intubation (ETI) performed outside 
of the operating room (OR) is an essential and life-
saving procedure. In contrast to airway management 
in the context of elective surgical patients, the incidence of 
difficult intubation (DI) and other airway-related complica-
tions (e.g., hypoxemia, hypotension, esophageal intubation, 
and aspiration) is significantly greater.1–4 A multistep pro-
cess for rapid induction/intubation to “…counteract regur-
gitation by gravity…prevent postural hypotension…[and] 
support the head in the sniffing position for intubation” was 
reported by Stept and Safar5 45 years ago. Most recently, 
Jaber et al.6 reported that a 10-point bundled intervention 
surrounding many aspects of ETI significantly reduced life-
threatening events such as severe circulatory collapse and 
severe oxygen desaturation during the first hour after intu-
bation. Patient positioning was not included in their list of 
interventions.
Studies involving normal weight as well as obese surgi-
cal patients suggest that preoxygenation is improved and 
apnea time prolonged when patients are in a back-up head-
elevated (BUHE) versus supine position.7–11 Significantly 
improved glottic views on direct laryngoscopy (DL) have 
also been reported with patients positioned in a BUHE ver-
sus supine position.12 With few exceptions, it would seem 
that placing patients in a BUHE position to be a simple 
maneuver, which would provide an added element of 
safety during an ETI procedure. However, data regarding 
its efficacy in reducing ETI-related complications are lack-
ing. Thus, we hypothesized that BUHE positioning, com-
pared with supine positioning, would be associated with a 
lower occurrence of ETI-related complications.

BACKGROUND: Based on the data from elective surgical patients, positioning patients in a 
back-up head-elevated position for preoxygenation and tracheal intubation can improve patient 
safety. However, data specific to the emergent setting are lacking. We hypothesized that back-
up head-elevated positioning would be associated with a decrease in complications related to 
tracheal intubation in the emergency room environment.
METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by the University of Washington Human 
Subjects Division (Seattle, WA). Eligible patients included all adults undergoing emergent tra-
cheal intubation outside of the operating room by the anesthesiology-based airway service at 
2 university-affiliated teaching hospitals. All intubations were through direct laryngoscopy for 
an indication other than full cardiopulmonary arrest. Patient characteristics and details of the 
intubation procedure were derived from the medical record. The primary study endpoint was 
the occurrence of a composite of any intubation-related complication: difficult intubation, hypox-
emia, esophageal intubation, or pulmonary aspiration. Multivariable logistic regression was 
used to estimate the odds of the primary endpoint in the supine versus back-up head-elevated 
positions with adjustment for a priori-defined potential confounders (body mass index and a dif-
ficult intubation prediction score [Mallampati, obstructive sleep Apnea, Cervical mobility, mouth 
Opening, Coma, severe Hypoxemia, and intubation by a non-Anesthesiologist score]).
RESULTS: Five hundred twenty-eight patients were analyzed. Overall, at least 1 intubation-
related complication occurred in 76 of 336 (22.6%) patients managed in the supine position 
compared with 18 of 192 (9.3%) patients managed in the back-up head-elevated position. After 
adjusting for body mass index and the Mallampati, obstructive sleep Apnea, Cervical mobility, 
mouth Opening, Coma, severe Hypoxemia, and intubation by a non-Anesthesiologist score, the 
odds of encountering the primary endpoint during an emergency tracheal intubation in a back-up 
head-elevated position was 0.47 (95% confidence interval, 0.26–0.83; P = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Placing patients in a back-up head-elevated position, compared with supine 
position, during emergency tracheal intubation was associated with a reduced odds of airway-
related complications.  (Anesth Analg 2016;122:1101–7)

Intubation with Head Elevation Decreases Complications
1102   www.anesthesia-analgesia.org 
ANesthesiA & ANAlgesiA
University of Washington (Seattle, WA) provide 866 licensed 
beds, the only level I trauma center servicing a 5-state area 
(Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho) 
and 150 adult intensive care unit (ICU) beds for medical, 
transplant, cardiac and cardiothoracic, trauma, surgical, 
burn, and neurosciences. Medical coverage for all locations 
is provided 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by intensivist-
led teams, which include an attending physician, a fellow, 
and senior and junior-level residents. The departments of 
surgery, anesthesiology, and internal medicine all provide 
trainees and attending physicians.
Out-of-operating room airway management in all loca-
tions other than the emergency department (ED; ward, ICU, 
remote locations such as radiology suites, etc.) is performed 
by a preassigned anesthesia airway team comprising an 
anesthesia trainee or nurse anesthetist and an attending 
anesthesiologist. Within the ED, primary responsibility for 
emergency airway management is shared between board-
certified emergency medicine-trained physicians and their 
trainees and the anesthesiology service depending on the 
type of admission (medical, surgical, or trauma). Regardless, 
the anesthesia-based airway team is available as backup via 
a universal paging system 24 hours, 7 days per week. In both 
situations, 2 operators are mandated. In addition, members 
of the department of respiratory therapy and bedside nurses 
familiar with emergency procedures attend all intubations. 
On the ward or in other remote locations such as radiology 
or the outpatient clinic areas, dedicated “rapid response” 
nurses also attend and assist with intubations as part of a 
dedicated rapid response team. When intubations occur in 
the ED or ICU, the unit bedside nurses attend and assist.
Eligibility Criteria
Eligible patients had to have been tracheally intubated 
outside the OR or postoperative recovery area at some 
time during their hospital stay. In addition, initial intuba-
tion attempts had to have been made using DL. Patients 
younger than 18 years, those intubated for cardiopulmo-
nary arrest, those intubated in the ED, or where initial intu-
bation attempts were made using a technique other than DL 
such as video laryngoscopy or flexible fiberoptic endoscopy 
were excluded. For patients who subsequently underwent 
reintubation during the same hospitalization, only the first 
intubation procedure was considered.
Data Collection
All intubation procedures generate a structured procedure 
note. Discrete fields in the note, which are completed by the 
provider(s), include details of the intubation such as the pro-
viders present and their experience level, the diagnosis, an 
external airway examination, the patient positioning for intu-
bation, the initial intubation technique, the laryngeal views 
attained, the number of intubation attempts performed, and 
any complications. In general, if a certified registered nurse 
anesthetist or anesthesia trainee performs an ETI, they com-
plete the electronic procedure note, which is then sent to the 
supervising attending anesthesiologist for review and final 
signature. At their discretion, the note can be revised to bet-
ter reflect actual events. All discrete fields from the intubation 
procedure note as well as demographic variables not included 
in the intubation note (age, sex, height, weight, body mass 
index [BMI], and the unit where the intubation took place) 
are captured by the hospital’s Caradigm Intelligence Platform 
(Caradigm USA LLC, Seattle, WA) and made available 
through a comprehensive out-of-OR intubation Structured 
Query Language-based reporting tool. For information not 
contained in the intubation note, but necessary to calculate the 
predicted intubation difficulty score, the electronic medical 
record was used to examine preanesthesia clinic notes, moder-
ate sedation evaluation forms, respiratory therapy documents, 
electronic medical record-generated problem lists, diagnoses 
on discharge summaries, and nursing vital sign documen-
tation during the peri-intubation period. In particular, the 
respiratory therapist(s) attending the intubation completes 
a separate quality improvement form, primarily intended 
as a safeguard against underreporting by the operators, but 
also to supplement missing data regarding complicated pro-
cedures. This form contains similar details as the intubation 
note regarding number of attempts at intubation, equipment 
used, and any complications. The time taken to secure the air-
way is not measured precisely to the minute but estimated 
to be from the start of induction to the time that the tube is 
confirmed by end-tidal gas detection and only recorded if >10 
minutes in duration. These forms are manually collected and 
entered by the Department of Anesthesiology’s dedicated 
quality improvement nurse into an electronic spreadsheet 
for later examination. All data abstraction was conducted by 
2 of the study authors (SK and AMJ). The medical records 
of adult patients tracheally intubated at Harborview and 
the University of Washington Medical Centers between 
November 2013 and April 2015 were included.
Study End Points and Definitions
The primary study endpoint was the occurrence of a com-
posite of any intubation-related complication (DI, hypox-
emia, esophageal intubation, or pulmonary aspiration) 
associated with the intubation procedure among patients 
intubated in either the supine or the head-elevated posi-
tion. DI was defined as ≥3 attempts at intubation, airway 
management of >10 minutes duration,13 or the need for a 
surgical airway in accordance with previous investiga-
tions.2,3,6,14,15 Hypoxemia was defined as a pulse oximetry 
reading <90% during or within 15 minutes of intubation if 
it had been >90% before induction.3 Pulmonary aspiration 
was defined as immediate peri-induction observation of 
gastric contents at the glottic opening or in the endotracheal 
tube.16 Intubating position was defined by the angle of the 
back above the horizontal as either supine (<30°) or head 
elevated (≥30°). The use of a towel or pillows to generate a 
“sniffing position” without sufficient back elevation above 
the horizontal was still considered supine positioning. Head 
elevation to ≥30° was accomplished using the patient’s bed 
or stretcher as shown in Figure 1. Towels or pillows were 
supplemented as needed to achieve the positioning unless 
contraindicated by spine precautions or not feasible based 
on the patient’s underlying anatomy. For intubations, which 
took place on the patient’s electronic hospital bed, the angle 
of back elevation in relationship to the horizontal is visually 
displayed. Back elevation was estimated when the intuba-
tion took place on a stretcher. Predicted intubation difficulty 
was assessed using the MACOCHA score,14 which stands

for Mallampati, obstructive sleep Apnea, Cervical mobil-
ity, mouth Opening, Coma, severe Hypoxemia, and intuba-
tion by a non-Anesthesiologist. The score ranges from 0 to 
12 with increasing values associated with greater odds of 
DI. Values assigned for each of the score items is as follows: 
Mallampati ≥3, 5 points; obstructive sleep apnea, 2 points; 
limited cervical mobility, 1 point; mouth opening <3 cm, 
 
1 point; coma defined as a Glasgow coma score ≤8, 1 point; 
severe hypoxemia defined as a saturation of ≤80% at the 
time of intubation, 1 point; and intubation by a nonanes-
thesiologist, 1 point. The score was derived from prospec-
tively collected data from 1000 consecutive intubations in 
42 ICUs. Data collected included patient characteristics, 
reason for ICU admission and intubation, operator expe-
rience, patient’s hemodynamic status, airway examina-
tion, intubation characteristics, and any intubation-related 
complications. It was subsequently validated externally in 
another 400 consecutive intubations from 18 other ICUs. 
The reported area under the curve for the simplified 7-item 
score was 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86–0.93) with 
a sensitivity of 73%, a specificity of 89%, a negative predic-
tive value of 98%, and a positive predictive value of 36%. 
Scores >3 have been used to predict DI.15
To account for differences in the care models between 
Europe and North America, we substituted “junior opera-
tor” for “nonanesthesiologist” in our calculation. A junior 
operator was one with <12 months of anesthesia-specific 
airway training. Thus, all anesthesia trainees before the 
start of their second clinical anesthesia year were consid-
ered junior. In contrast, all nurse anesthetists, anesthesia 
trainees at or beyond their second clinical anesthesia year, 
anesthesia fellows, and attendings were considered senior.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline demographic and clinical variables were com-
pared between patients intubated in the supine and head-
elevated positions using a 2-sample Student t test with the 
assumption of unequal variances (Satterthwaite degrees of 
freedom) for continuous variables and χ2 tests for categori-
cal variables. Multivariable logistic regression was used to 
estimate the odds of the composite end point occurring dur-
ing intubation in the supine and head-elevated positions. 
Models were adjusted for BMI as a continuous linear vari-
able and the MACOCHA score as categorical variable, both 
a priori-defined potential confounders. We performed sepa-
rate sensitivity analyses to explore the association between 
(1) patient position and DI and (2) patient position and the 
occurrence of an intubation-related complication other than 
DI (hypoxemia, esophageal intubation, and/or pulmonary 
aspiration), adjusting for the same confounders.
In addition, to account for potential practice changes 
other than positioning that might have benefitted patients 
undergoing ETI during the study period, we ran separate 
models including year of intubation. We also adjusted for 
operator experience as a separate covariate to verify robust-
ness of our results. A 2-sided α <0.05 was considered statis-
tically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using 
STATA statistical software, version 12.0 (StataCorp, College 
Station, TX).
RESULTS
Five hundred twenty-eight patients were analyzed (Fig. 2). 
Thirty-two patients met the definition for difficult to intu-
bate. Almost all of these (30/32 [93%]) were considered 
difficult based on requiring ≥3 attempts at intubation; 
23 underwent 3 attempts, 6 underwent 4 attempts, and 
 
1 underwent 5 attempts culminating in a surgical airway. Of 
these, the GlideScope® GVL video laryngoscope (Verathon, 
Inc., Bothell, WA) was used alone for airway rescue in 50% 
(15/30) and in combination with a fiberoptic broncho-
scope in 3 (10%) additional patients. In the remaining 12 
(40%) patients, DL was the only laryngoscopic technique 
attempted. A single-use 15-Fr 70-cm coude tip tracheal 
tube introducer (SunMed, Grand Rapids, MI) was used to 
facilitate intubation in 3 (25%) of these cases. Two additional 
patients met the definition for difficult based on perfor-
mance of a surgical airway after the initial attempt at intu-
bation by DL. No patient was considered difficult based on 
the intubation procedure requiring >10 minutes as the only 
criteria. The differences between patients intubated in the 
supine and head-elevated positions are presented in Table 1. 
The proportion of patients who had a Spo2 <80% at the time 
of intubation (9.4% vs 6.8%, P = 0.43) or limited cervical 
spine motion (10.1% vs 10.3%, P = 1.0) were similar between 
groups. However, more patients in the head-elevated group 
had a Glasgow Coma Scale <8 (15.1% vs 29.3%, P = 0.04) and 
were intubated by a senior operator (66% vs 93%, P < 0.01).
Overall, at least 1 intubation-related complication 
occurred in 76 of 336 (22.6%) patients managed in the 
supine position compared with 18 of 192 (9.3%) managed 
in the BUHE position. After adjusting for BMI and the 
MACOCHA score, head-elevated versus supine positioning 
was associated with significantly lower odds of reaching 
the primary endpoint (odds ratio = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.23–0.77;

the back is raised at least 30° above the horizontal (2) and the 
head is placed in the “sniffing position” using towels or a towel roll

P = 0.005). In sensitivity analyses, the odds ratio for DI was 
0.88 (95% CI, 0.24–3.21; P = 0.848), whereas the odds for a 
composite of hypoxemia, aspiration, or esophageal intuba-
tion was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.22–0.76; P = 0.005; Table 2). Finally, 
in addition, controlling for operator experience and the year 
of intubation, in addition to MACOCHA and BMI, did not 
alter results significantly (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
Our main finding is that ETI performed in a BUHE posi-
tion was associated with lower odds of encountering an 
intubation-related complication compared with supine 
positioning when taking into account body habitus and 
predicted difficulty. In the OR environment, this finding 
is not novel. Indeed, a number of investigators have pre-
viously reported a beneficial effect of BUHE positioning 
during the induction of anesthesia, which include better 
preoxygenation resulting in longer apnea times7–11 as well 
as improved glottic visualization during DL.12 Lee et al,12 
in 40 patients, randomly performed laryngoscopy in either 
the supine or a 25° head-elevated position. The percent-
age glottic opening score was improved by approximately 
25% in the head-elevated position compared with the flat 
supine position. During ETI, such an improvement may 
be the difference between a straightforward uncompli-
cated intubation and one that is difficult and/or com-
plicated. However, this benefit is not supported by our 
analysis, because we found that the associated reduction 
in intubation-related complications was driven by fewer 
episodes of hypoxemia, esophageal intubation, and/or 
pulmonary aspiration rather than DI. Two principle rea-
sons likely account for this finding. DI was uncommon in 
our series and, thus, our study may have been underpow-
ered to detect a difference with DI as an isolated outcome. 
Alternatively, or in combination with the former, specific 
risk factors that place the patient at an increased risk for DI 
may not be modifiable by patient position, whereas com-
plications such as hypoxemia, esophageal intubation, and 
pulmonary aspiration may be modified. In addition to the 
theoretic benefit of BUHE position on oxygen reserves,17 
such positioning stands to reduce the risk of passive gas-
tric regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration.
A number of risk assessment scores have been studied 
for their ability to identify an otherwise unanticipated DI 
in OR patients.18–22 With respect to ETI, however, they are 
severely limited insofar as an extensive examination of 
external airway features is often not possible.23 Some have 
even suggested that the external airway examination is of 
questionable value.24 Therefore, one strength of our study 
was to incorporate a validated prediction score, specific to 
ETI outside the OR, as a covariate in our analyses. Although 
other studies have previously reported on outcomes of ETI 
in critical care,1–4,16,25 none has presented outcomes adjusting 
for predicted difficulty.
Our study has several limitations. The intubation data 
are self-reported and subject to reporting bias. Indeed, our 
reported incidence of DI is 6%. Videolaryngoscopes, spe-
cifically a variety of different glidescopes (GlideScope AVL 
Reusable, GlideScope AVL Single Use, and GlideScope 
Ranger Reusable; Verathon, Inc.), are available for use 
in several out-of-OR locations. The availability of such 
advanced airway devices could have introduced a selec-
tion bias away from patients suspected or known to have 
a difficult airway, explaining, in part, our low rates of 
observed DI with DL. Alternatively, or in combination with 
the former explanation, intubations performed by experi-
enced operators, all of whom are sufficiently practiced in 
DL, might have driven down the DI rate. However, our DI 
rates are consistent with previous prospective cohort stud-
ies, which report rates of 6.6% to 13.2%.1–3,16 Our reported 
incidence of aspiration and esophageal intubation, approx-
imately 2% each, are also similar to previous reports.3,16,25 
Importantly, the position in which the patient was pre-
oxygenated and subsequently intubated could have been 
mistakenly recorded. Providers are regularly instructed 
as to the definition of what constitutes a BUHE position; 
the head of the bed at >30°, but we cannot guarantee that 
the patient was in such a position. Patients in whom the 
degrees of head elevation were estimated could have been 
close to but not >30° (e.g., 20°–25°). Because most patients 
are intubated in the supine position and extra time and 
effort are required to position the patient with their head 
elevated, we believe that it is less likely that providers 
incorrectly identified patient position in the record as 
head-elevated when they were actually supine. We also 
acknowledge that patients listed as supine could have been 
slightly elevated (e.g., 10°). Also, because of the retrospec-
tive nature of our study, we have limited insight into why 
some patients were positioned with the head elevated and 
others were not. In fact, MACOCHA scores were higher in 
the supine than head-elevated group, so we are left to won-
der why practitioners would make the effort to position 
patients in the head-elevated position if not for concern 
over anticipated airway difficulty. Severe hemodynamic 
instability or presumed intracranial hypertension might 
affect the practitioner’s choice of positioning. Hypotension, 
defined as a systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg within 
 
15 minutes of the peri-intubation period, is a complication

Intubation with Head Elevation Decreases Complications

field in our structure procedure note. Among our study 
cohort, the occurrence of hypotension in patients intu-
bated in the supine and BUHE positions was similar, 53 of 
336 (15.8%) and 31 of 192 (16.1%), respectively. However, 
because we did not record the preintubation blood pres-
sures, we cannot determine whether hemodynamic insta-
bility may have biased practitioners toward one intubating 
position or whether the BUHE position might more com-
monly result in a meaningful decrease in postinduction 
blood pressure. Future prospective data will need to be col-
lected. However, only 3% of patients in our cohort were 
intubated for an indication of shock or intracranial hyper-
tension (listed in Table 1 as “other”).
Obesity and severe hypoxemia at intubation were also 
similar between groups. However, we did note that senior 
operators intubated a larger proportion of patients in the 
BUHE position than their junior colleagues. This could have 
been because of heightened clinical suspicion for airway 
difficulty or ETI-related complications not captured by a 
prediction score. However, separate analyses adjusting for 
operator experience alone still yielded intubating position 
as an independent predictor of complications. Alternatively 
or in combination, this may represent a learning effect. At 
our institution, we teach trainees that all ETI should be 
performed in the BUHE position unless contraindicated. 
Therefore, it would be expected that as residents advance 
through their training and gain greater experience in ETI, 
they would be more likely to include positioning as part 
of their preintubation checklist. This was not confirmed by 
adding the year in which a patient was intubated as a covari-
ate in the regression model. Also, the fact that only 15% of 
our study cohort was predicted to be a DI (MACOCHA score 
≥3) suggests a potential selection bias for lower risk patients. 
On one hand, this could limit the external validity of our 
results to the highest risk patients. On the other hand, our 
findings would suggest that use of the BUHE position for 
ETI may allow improved safety, even in the relatively lower 
risk critically ill patient population. The reader will note that 
we did not specifically take into account several potential 
confounders such as admitting diagnosis, severity of illness, 
preintubation vital signs, or individual elements of the air-
way examination. Rather, we used the MACOCHA score, 
which was developed taking these factors into account.14 
Intubations, which were performed by our emergency medi-
cine colleagues, were excluded from our cohort. Our ratio-
nale was to limit unmeasured confounding that could result 
from operator experience. Finally, we acknowledge the 
inherent limitations of observational data and that residual, 
unmeasured confounding may persist.
We have shown an association between intubating posi-
tion and ETI-related complications. This must not to be con-
fused with a causal relationship, which our study design 
does not allow us to infer. Our findings require confirmation 
in a prospective randomized controlled trial. However, we 
believe that placing patients in a BUHE position is a rela-
tively easy maneuver to perform, optimizes conditions for a 
variety of airway management techniques, including venti-
lation by facemask, extraglottic airways, videolaryngoscopy, 
and flexible fiberoptic endoscopy, has no associated cost, is 
easily understood and executed by the staff, and requires no 
advanced technology or power source other than the bed. 
Thus, outside of patients in whom its use is contraindicated, 
we suggest the BUHE position for undergoing ETI. E
