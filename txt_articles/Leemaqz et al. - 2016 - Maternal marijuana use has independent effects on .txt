Widespread
 legalisation
 of  marijuana
 raises  safety  concerns
 for its  use  in  pregnancy.
 This  study
 inves-
tigated
 the  association
 of marijuana
 use  prior  to  and  during
 pregnancy
 with  pregnancy
 outcomes
 in
a
 prospective
 cohort
 of 5588
 nulliparous
 women
 from  the  international
 SCOPE  study.
 Women
 were
assessed
 at  15 ±
 1 and  20  ±  1 weeks’
 gestation.
 Cases
 [278  Preeclampsia,
 470  gestational
 hypertension,
633
 small-for-gestational-age,
 236  spontaneous
 preterm
 births
 (SPTB),
 143  gestational
 diabetes]  were
compared
 separately
 with 4114
 non-cases.
 Although
 the  numbers
 are  small,  continued
 maternal
 mari-
juana
 use  at  20  weeks’
 gestation
 was  associated
 with
 SPTB  independent
 of  cigarette
 smoking  status
 [adj

 (95%
 CI:1.45–3.59)]
 and  socioeconomic
 index  (SEI)  [adj OR  2.17  (95%  CI:1.41–3.34)].
 When  adjusted
for
 maternal
 age,  cigarette
 smoking,
 alcohol  and  SEI,  continued
 maternal
 marijuana
 use  at  20
 weeks’
gestation
 had  a greater
 effect  size  [adj  OR  5.44  (95%  CI  2.44–12.11)].
 Our  data  indicate
 that increasing
 use
of
 marijuana
 among
 young
 women
 of reproductive
 age
 is a  major  public
 health
 concern.

 Introduction
A
 2015
 conference
 on
 medical
 use
 of
 marijuana
 indicated
 that
23
 US
 states
 have
 legalised
 medical
 marijuana
 with
 some
 also
legalising
 marijuana
 for
 recreational
 use
 [1].
 Although
 there
 is
moderate
 evidence
 for
 efficacy
 of
 cannabinoids
 for
 chronic
 pain
and
 spasticity
 [2],
 and
 some
 evidence
 for
 Multiple
 Sclerosis
 and
treatment-resistant
 epilepsy
 [3–5],
 there
 is
 not
 good
 evidence
 for
its
 use
 to
 treat
 nausea
 and
 vomiting
 associated
 with
 chemotherapy,

perhaps
 the
 best
 known
 indication
 for
 medical
 marijuana
 [6].
 Some
pregnant
 women
 report
 using
 marijuana
 to
 alleviate
 nausea
 and
vomiting
 in
 pregnancy
 with
 success
 [7]
 but
 evidence
 for
 its
 efficacy
is
 mostly
 anecdotal.
 However,
 reports
 of
 adverse
 events
 for
 non-
pregnant
 populations
 using
 medical
 marijuana
 [6]
 raise
 concerns
for
 pregnant
 marijuana
 users.
According
 to
 the
 National
 Drug
 Strategy
 Household
 Survey
 [8]
in
 Australia,
 7.6%
 of
 females
 aged
 ≥14
 years
 used
 marijuana
 during
2010
 (1%
 increase
 compared
 to
 2007),
 with
 34.8%
 of
 the
 female
population
 having
 used
 marijuana
 at
 least
 once
 in
 their
 lifetime.
 A
similar
 trend
 has
 also
 been
 observed
 in
 New
 Zealand
 and
 Europe,
with
 47.2%
 of
 women
 aged
 ≥16
 years
 in
 NZ
 (from
 2007
 to
 2008)
[9,10],
 24.6%
 in
 the
 United
 Kingdom
 and
 17.5%
 in
 Ireland
 having
used
 marijuana
 at
 least
 once
 [11].
Apart
 from
 reported
 negative
 impacts
 on
 fetal
 growth
 and
brain
 development
 [12–16],
 marijuana
 has
 been
 associated

adverse
 pregnancy
 outcomes,
 including
 preterm
 birth
 (PTB),
 small
for
 gestational
 age
 (SGA),
 placental
 abruption
 and
 antepartum
haemorrhage
 [17–21].
 Specifically,
 studies
 have
 shown
 that
 using
marijuana
 during
 pregnancy
 is
 associated
 with
 low
 birthweight
 and
increases
 the
 risk
 of
 PTB
 and
 SGA,
 with
 an
 odds
 ratio
 of
 at
 least
 1.5
when
 adjusted
 for
 age,
 BMI
 and
 smoking
 [17,20–22].
The
 association
 between
 marijuana
 use
 and
 pregnancy
 out-
comes
 is
 often
 confounded
 by
 other
 known
 risk
 factors
 including
cigarette
 smoking,
 body
 mass
 index
 (BMI),
 and
 socioeconomic
index
 (SEI)
 [23,24].
 Women
 who
 use
 marijuana
 also
 tend
 to
 smoke
cigarettes
 and
 are
 more
 likely
 to
 use
 other
 drugs
 and
 alcohol,
 for
whom
 national
 statistics
 [25]
 have
 shown
 that
 amongst
 Australian
women
 aged
 ≥14years
 who
 used
 marijuana
 in
 2010,
 82.7%
 also
consumed
 alcohol,
 and
 68.5%
 were
 cigarette
 smokers,
 with
 similar
patterns
 of
 prevalence
 in
 New
 Zealand
 [10].
There
 have
 been
 inconsistent
 results
 reported
 from
 American
prospective
 cohort
 studies,
 in
 which
 associations
 of
 marijuana
 use
with
 adverse
 pregnancy
 outcomes
 were
 either
 found
 [21,26,27]
 or
not
 found
 [28–30].
 Hence,
 this
 study
 aimed
 to
 examine
 the
 associ-
ation
 of
 maternal
 marijuana
 use
 (from
 pre-pregnancy
 and
 up
 to
 20
weeks’
 gestation)
 in
 a
 multi-centre
 cohort
 with
 major
 pregnancy
complications,
 amongst
 both
 cigarette
 smokers
 and
 non-smokers,
controlling
 for
 well-known
 risk
 factors
 including
 age,
 SEI
 and
 BMI,
as
 well
 as
 its
 effects
 on
 length
 of
 gestation.

 Methods
Data
 from
 this
 analysis
 were
 obtained
 from
 the
 SCreening
 fOr
Pregnancy
 Endpoints
 (SCOPE)
 study,
 which
 aimed
 to
 build
 a
 clin-
ical
 database
 and
 pregnancy
 biobank
 to
 screen
 candidate
 markers
of
 pregnancy
 complications.
 The
 SCOPE
 study
 recruited
 nulliparous
women
 with
 singleton
 pregnancies
 between
 November
 2004
 and
February
 2011
 from
 one
 centre
 in
 each
 of
 Australia,
 New
 Zealand,
and
 Ireland,
 and
 three
 centres
 in
 the
 United
 Kingdom.
 Ethical
approval
 was
 obtained
 from
 local
 ethics
 committees

 and
 all
women
 provided
 written
 informed
 consent.
Women
 were
 invited
 to
 participate
 prior
 to
 15
 weeks’
 gestation
when
 attending
 hospital
 antenatal
 clinics,
 obstetricians,
 general
practitioners
 or
 community
 midwives,
 and
 were
 interviewed
 and
examined
 by
 a
 research
 midwife
 at
 15
 ±
 1
 and
 20
 ±

 weeks
 of
 ges-
tation.
The
 exclusion
 criteria
 included
 women
 who
 were
 considered
to
 be
 at
 high
 risk
 of
 PE,
 SGA
 or
 PTB
 due
 to
 underlying
 medical
conditions
 (e.g.
 chronic
 hypertension
 requiring
 antihypertensive
medication
 or
 diabetes),
 previous
 cervical
 knife
 cone
 biopsy,
 three
terminations
 or
 three
 miscarriages
 or
 if
 their
 pregnancy
 was
 com-
plicated
 by
 a
 known
 major
 fetal
 anomaly
 or
 abnormal
 karyotype,
 or
if
 they
 received
 interventions
 that
 may
 modify
 pregnancy
 outcome
(e.g.
 aspirin,
 cervical
 suture).

 of
 maternal
 age,

[31],
 medical
 and
 family
 history,
 along
 with
 dietary

 lifestyle
questionnaires
 with
 self-reported
 marijuana

ing
 were
 recorded
 at
 15

 and
entered
 into
 an
 internet-accessed,
 password-protected
 centralised
database
 with

 [32].
The
 number
 of
 episodes
 of
 marijuana
 use
 over
 3
 months
 was
also
 recorded
 at
 15
 weeks
 and

nancy
 in
 SCOPE,
 but
 there
 were
 insufficient
 data
 to
 be
 included
for
 analysis.
Self-
 reported
 marijuana
 and
 cigarette
 smoking
 status
 were
 clas-
sified
 into
 five
 categories
 (i.e.
 never,
 quit
 prior
 to
 pregnancy,
 quit
prior
 to
 15
 weeks’
 gestation,
 still
 using
 at
 15
 weeks’
 gestation,
 and
still
 using
 at
 20
 weeks’
 gestation)
 in
 univariable
 and
 multivariable
analysis,
 with
 ‘non-smoking’
 or
 ‘never
 used
 marijuana’
 as
 the
 ref-
erence
 categories.
 The
 number
 of
 reported
 episodes
 of
 marijuana
use
 was
 included
 as
 a
 continuous
 variable
 for
 frequency
 effect
 esti-
mation.
 Use
 was
 self-reported
 where
 women
 provided
 the
 number
of
 joints
 or
 cones
 used.
Spontaneous
 preterm
 birth
 (SPTB)
 was
 defined
 as
 birth
 at
less
 than
 37
 weeks
 of
 gestation
 that
 was
 not
 a
 result
 of
 medi-
cal
 or
 obstetric
 intervention.
 Small
 for
 gestational
 age
 (SGA)
 was
defined
 as
 a
 birthweight
 of
 less
 than
 the
 10th
 customised
 centile,
adjusted
 for
 maternal
 height,
 weight,
 parity,
 ethnicity,
 gestational
age
 at
 delivery
 and
 infant
 sex.
 Preeclampsia
 (PE)
 was
 defined
as
 gestational
 hypertension
 (GHT)
 (blood
 pressure
 of
 140/90
 or
greater
 on
 at
 least
 2
 occasions
 4
 h
 apart
 after
 20
 weeks’
 gesta-
tion)
 accompanied
 by
 proteinuria
 (300
 mg/day
 or
 greater,
 or
 a
 spot
protein
 creatinine
 ratio
 of
 30
 mg/mmol
 creatinine
 or
 greater).
 Ges-
tational
 diabetes
 mellitus
 (GDM)
 was
 defined
 as
 a
 fasting
 glucose
of
 5.5
 mmol/L
 or
 higher
 in
 a
 Glucose
 Tolerance
 Test,
 a
 2
 h
 level
of
 8
 mmol
 or
 higher,
 or
 a
 random
 glucose
 level
 of
 11
 nmol/L
 or
higher.
 Universal
 screening
 was
 not
 employed
 for
 GDM
 in
 the
 UK
and
 Ireland,
 where
 only
 women
 identified
 at
 risk
 based
 on
 factors
such
 as
 family
 history
 and
 BMI
 were
 screened.
2.1.
 Statistical
 analysis
A
 total
 of
 5588
 participants
 were
 included
 in
 the
 analysis,
 with
1155
 participants
 recruited
 from
 Australia,
 2014
 from
 New
 Zealand,
1765
 from
 Ireland,
 and
 654
 from
 the
 United
 Kingdom.
 Within
 the
1514
 pregnancies
 with
 complications,
 278
 had
 PE,
 633
 had
 SGA,
236
 had
 SPTB,
 470
 had
 GHT,
 and
 143
 had
 GDM
 (Fig.
 1).
 Details
 on
age,
 BMI,
 SEI,
 as
 well
 as
 marijuana
 use
 and
 cigarette
 smoking
 status
were
 complete
 for
 all
 participants.
Marijuana
 
and
 
cigarette
 
smoking
 
status
 
were
 
compared
between
 non-cases
 and
 each
 of
 the
 outcomes
 separately
 using
Fisher’s
 exact
 test.
 Although
 about
 4%
 of
 women
 (n
 =
 232)
 had
 more
than
 one
 pregnancy
 complication,
 each
 outcome
 was
 analysed
 sep-
arately
 compared
 with
 non-cases.
 Continuous
 factors,
 including
maternal
 age,
 BMI
 and
 SEI
 were
 compared
 using
 Student’s
 t-test.
To
 investigate
 the
 effects
 of
 marijuana
 use
 between
 smokers
and
 non-smokers,
 analysis
 of
 marijuana
 use,
 stratified
 by
 cigarette
smoking
 status
 for
 each
 outcome
 was
 performed.
 Breslow-Day
test
 was
 used
 to
 assess
 the
 homogeneity
 of
 the
 odds
 of
 mari-
juana
 use
 between
 cigarette
 smokers
 and
 non-smokers,
 along
 with
an
 adjusted
 common
 odds
 estimated
 from
 Mantel-Haenszel
 test
[33,34].
Marijuana
 and
 cigarette
 smoking
 status
 were
 then
 analysed
with
 mixed
 effects
 logistic
 regression
 to
 determine
 the
 association
with
 pregnancy
 outcomes,
 adjusting
 for
 maternal
 age,
 BMI
 and
 SEI,
and
 with
 recruiting
 centre
 differences
 accounted
 for
 as
 a
 random
effect.
 Interaction
 tests
 were
 also
 performed
 by
 comparing
 logistic
regression
 models
 that
 included
 interaction
 terms.
 A
 linear
 mixed
model
 was
 also
 fitted
 for
 length
 of
 gestation,
 with
 quadratic
 terms
for
 the
 number
 of
 times
 marijuana
 was
 used
 over
 the
 preceding
 3
months
 at
 15
 and
 20
 weeks
 of
 gestation,
 age,
 and
 BMI,
 to
 inves-
tigate
 the
 dose
 effect
 of
 marijuana
 and
 cigarette
 smoking
 status
on
 the
 length
 of
 gestation
 adjusted
 for
 other
 factors
 in
 the
 model.
The
 estimated
 power
 of
 this
 analysis,
 involving
 logistic
 regression
with
 interaction
 terms,
 is
 0.99
 [35].
 All
 statistical
 analyses
 were
performed
 using
 R
 version
 3.2.0.

 Results
Of
 the
 5588
 participants,
 who
 were
 predominantly
 Caucasian
(Table
 1),
 the
 overall
 proportion
 of
 women
 reporting
 the
 use
 of
marijuana
 before
 or
 during
 pregnancy
 was
 5.6%,
 with
 the
 partici-
pating
 centre
 in
 Australia
 having
 the
 highest
 rate
 of
 women
 using
marijuana
 (11.6%),
 followed
 by
 New
 Zealand
 (4.5%),
 Ireland
 (3.8%),
and
 United
 Kingdom
 (3.7%).
 Compared
 to
 marijuana
 use,
 the
 pro-
portion
 of
 cigarette
 smokers
 was
 higher,
 with
 an
 overall
 26.4%
 of
women
 reporting
 that
 they
 smoked
 cigarettes
 before
 or
 during
pregnancy.
 Amongst
 Australian
 participants,
 40.8%
 reported
 they
were
 cigarette
 smokers
 at
 conception
 as
 well
 as
 29.7%
 of
 Irish,
 29.5%
of
 UK
 and
 14.2%
 of
 NZ
 participants.
 Country
 specific

The
 overall
 characteristics
 comparing
 each
 of
 the

 There
 were
 signifi-

 differences
 in
 the
 average
 BMI
 and
 SEI
 between
 non-cases
 and
all

 analysed,
 where
 BMI
 was
 higher
 in
 women
 who
 devel-

 or
 SPTB
 (25.4

 Similarly,
SEI
 was
 lower
 on

 and
SGA
 (40.1
 ±
 0.64;
 P

 Women
 who
 developed
 PE
 were
 also
slightly
 younger
 on
 average
 (27.7
 ±

 vs
 28.7
 ±
 0.09
 in

 while
 patients
 who
 developed

 were
 older
(30
 ±

Marijuana
 use
 and
 cigarette
 smoking
 at
 20
 weeks
 of
 gestation
were
 both
 associated
 with
 SGA
 (18.6%
 smoking
 vs
 only
 8.9%
 in
non-cases;
 P
 <
 0.001,
 and
 1.9%
 marijuana

 vs

 and
 SPTB
 (16.1%
 smoking
 vs
 8.9%
 in

 P
 =
 0.001,
and
 4.7%
 marijuana
 use
 vs
 0.7%
 in
 non-cases;
 P

 For
 both
 of
these
 outcomes,
 there
 was
 a
 higher
 proportion
 of
 women
 who
 con-
tinued
 to
 smoke
 cigarettes
 or
 use
 marijuana
 at
 20
 weeks’
 gestation.
In
 women
 who
 delivered
 a
 SGA
 infant,
 18.6%
 continued
 to
 smoke
cigarettes
 (compared
 to
 8.9%
 in
 non-cases)
 and
 1.9%
 continued
 to
use
 marijuana
 (compared
 to
 0.7%
 in
 non-cases),
 while
 in
 women
who
 delivered
 preterm,
 16.1%
 continued
 to
 smoke
 cigarettes
 and
4.7%
 continued
 to
 use
 marijuana
 at
 20
 weeks’
 gestation.
The
 proportion
 of
 women
 reporting
 any
 alcohol
 consumption
(Table
 2),
 from
 3
 months
 prior
 to
 pregnancy
 to
 20
 weeks’
 gestation,
was
 similar
 in
 women
 who
 had
 any
 complications
 (less
 than
 77.3%)
compared
 to
 non-cases
 (78.6%).
 Fewer
 women
 with
 SPTB
 (10.2%;
P
 =
 0.004),
 PE
 (11.5%;
 P
 =
 0.002),
 and
 GDM
 (10.5%;
 P
 =
 0.006)
 contin-
ued
 to
 use
 alcohol
 at
 20
 weeks’
 gestation
 compared
 to
 non-cases
(15.2%).
Furthermore,
 amongst
 women
 with
 SPTB,
 those
 who
 continued
to
 use
 marijuana
 at
 20
 weeks’
 gestation
 had
 a
 significantly
 shorter
gestation
 on
 average
 of
 29.6
 ±
 1.6
 weeks,
 compared
 to
 34.1
 ±
 0.3
weeks
 in
 those
 with
 SPTB
 who
 did
 not
 use
 marijuana
 (P
 =
 0.005)
(Table
 3).
 The
 proportion
 of
 very
 early
 SPTB
 was
 also
 higher,
 with
36.4%
 having
 delivered
 at
 less
 than
 28
 weeks
 of
 gestation
 and
 63.6%
at
 less
 than
 32
 weeks
 in
 women
 who
 continued
 to
 use
 marijuana
at
 20
 weeks’
 gestation,
 compared
 to
 4.7%
 and
 15.8%
 amongst
 non-
users,
 respectively.

 Interaction
 between
 maternal
 marijuana
 use
 and
 cigarette
smoking
It
 was
 important
 to
 determine
 whether
 the
 association
 with
marijuana
 use
 was
 due
 to
 concomitant
 cigarette
 smoking.
 Breslow-
Day
 test
 showed
 no
 evidence
 of
 heterogeneity
 in
 the
 association
 of
marijuana
 use
 and
 pregnancy
 outcomes
 between
 smokers
 and
 non-
smokers
 (P
 =
 0.238),
 which
 indicates
 that
 the
 association
 between
marijuana
 and
 SPTB
 was
 consistent
 regardless
 of
 cigarette
 smoking
status.
 Hence,
 when
 comparing
 any
 marijuana
 use,
 three
 months
prior
 to
 or
 during
 pregnancy,
 between
 cigarette
 smokers
 and

smokers,
 there
 was
 a
 significant
 independent
 association
 between
any
 marijuana
 use
 and
 SPTB
 (P
 =
 0.001).
While
 the
 association
 between
 marijuana
 use
 and
 SPTB
 was
independent
 of
 smoking
 status,
 the
 Mantel-Haenszel
 test
 (Table
 5)
further
 indicated
 that
 the
 overall
 association
 was
 also
 signifi-
cant
 (P
 <
 0.001),
 with
 an
 adjusted
 common
 odds
 of
 2.28
 (95%
 CI
1.45–3.59).
 That
 is,
 the
 odds
 of
 SPTB
 for
 any
 marijuana
 use
 three
months
 prior
 to
 or
 during
 pregnancy
 was
 more
 than
 doubled
 for
both
 cigarette
 smokers
 and
 non-smokers.
Regarding
 the
 interaction
 effect
 of
 marijuana
 in
 women
 who
ceased
 cigarette
 smoking
 during
 pregnancy,
 results
 from
 Breslow-
Day
 test
 on
 the
 homogeneity
 of
 the
 odds
 of
 any
 marijuana
 use
 (three
months
 prior
 to
 or
 during
 pregnancy),
 between
 women
 who
 con-
tinued
 cigarette
 smoking
 before
 20
 weeks’
 gestation
 and
 those
 who
stopped
 smoking,
 showed
 no
 evidence
 of
 heterogeneity
 (P
 =
 0.541),
with
 a
 Mantel-Haenszel
 adjusted
 odds
 of
 1.97
 (95%
 CI
 1.26–3.09).
This
 indicated
 that
 the
 effect
 of
 marijuana
 use
 was
 not
 only
 inde-
pendent
 of
 any
 cigarette
 smoking
 three
 months
 prior
 to
 or
 during
pregnancy
 (as
 reported
 above),
 but
 was
 also
 consistent,
 with
 nearly
doubled
 odds,
 irrespective
 of
 whether
 cigarette
 smoking
 ceased
prior
 to
 20
 weeks’
 gestation.
Results
 from
 Logistic
 regression
 with
 an
 interaction
 term
between
 marijuana
 use
 and
 cigarette
 smoking
 status
 also
 showed
no
 significant
 interaction
 effects
 on
 SPTB
 (P
 =
 0.719).

 Interaction
 between
 maternal
 marijuana
 use
 and
 low

Interaction
 between
 marijuana
 use
 and
 socio-economic
 sta-
tus
 was
 also
 tested,
 and
 no
 significant
 interaction
 effect
 was
seen
 for
 all

 analysed,
 when
 added
 as
 an

 in
 multivariable

 When
 comparing
 low

 in
 the
 lower
 quartile
 (SEI
 <28),
 with
 any
marijuana
 use,
 Breslow-Day
 test
 also
 showed
 no
 evidence
 of

 (P

 indicating
 that
 the

 Similarly,
 as

 was
 associated
 with
 SGA,
 with
an

 was
 a

 Effect
 on
 length
 of
 gestation
The
 results
 from
 linear
 mixed
 modelling
 showed
 that
 marijuana
use
 in
 first
 (P
 =
 0.000)
 or
 second
 trimester
 (P
 =
 0.002)
 had
 signifi-
cant
 effects
 on
 length
 of
 gestation,
 when
 adjusted
 for
 age,
 BMI,
 SEI,
cigarette
 smoking
 status,
 and
 alcohol
 consumption.
 The
 predicted
length
 of
 gestation
 (Fig.
 2)
 was
 lower
 for
 women
 who
 continued
to
 use
 marijuana
 at
 20
 weeks
 of
 gestation
 for
 both
 cigarette
 smok-
ers
 and
 non-smokers,
 with
 an
 estimated
 gestation
 of
 less
 than
 37
weeks
 when
 more
 than
 100
 episodes
 of
 marijuana
 use
 within
 the
previous
 three
 months
 before
 20
 weeks’
 gestation
 (i.e.
 more
 than
once
 per
 day
 for
 the
 preceding
 3
 months).
It
 should
 be
 noted
 that
 there
 was
 a
 small
 but
 significant
 decrease
in
 the
 predicted
 length
 of
 gestation
 for
 cigarette
 smokers
 compared
to
 non-smokers
 (P
 =
 0.002
 at
 15
 weeks’
 gestation,
 and
 P
 =
 0.006
 at
20
 weeks’
 gestation).
 However,
 our
 data
 show
 that
 continued
 mar-
ijuana
 use
 at
 20
 weeks
 of
 gestation
 has
 a
 greater
 effect
 on
 gestation
irrespective
 of
 cigarette
 smoking
 status.
Linear
 mixed
 modelling
 (Fig.
 2)
 indicates
 a
 modest
 reduction
 in
gestation
 in
 women
 who
 ceased
 marijuana
 use
 at
 15
 weeks’
 ges-
tation.
 However,
 in
 women
 who
 continued
 to
 use
 marijuana
 at
 20
weeks’
 gestation,
 there
 was
 a
 much
 greater
 decline
 in
 gestational
age
 at
 delivery
 (Fig.

 Discussion
Marijuana
 use
 is
 increasing
 in
 women
 of
 reproductive
 age
 and
its
 continued
 use
 in
 pregnancy
 has
 been
 of
 concern
 for
 some
 time
[12].
 In
 addition,
 we
 have
 anecdotal
 evidence
 to
 suggest
 that
 some
pregnant
 women
 are
 using
 marijuana
 to
 reduce
 nausea
 in
 early

pregnancy.
 In
 this
 large
 prospective
 cohort
 of
 nulliparous
 women
we
 have
 demonstrated
 that
 continued
 maternal
 use
 of
 marijuana
 at
20
 weeks’
 gestation
 is
 a
 major
 contributing
 risk
 factor
 for
 SPTB.
 Uni-
variable
 analysis
 showed
 a
 significant
 association
 of
 marijuana
 use
at
 20
 weeks’
 gestation
 with
 SPTB
 and
 also
 SGA,
 but
 when
 adjusted
for
 other
 factors,
 in
 particular
 cigarette
 smoking,
 marijuana
 use
 was
only
 a
 significant
 independent
 risk
 factor
 for
 SPTB.
 Furthermore,
 if
marijuana
 use
 was
 continued
 at
 20
 weeks’
 gestation,
 women
 were
over
 five
 times
 more
 likely
 to
 deliver
 preterm
 than
 nonusers.
 Of
 the
women
 who
 continued
 to
 use
 marijuana
 at
 20
 weeks’
 gestation
 and
delivered
 preterm,
 nearly
 64%
 delivered
 at
 less
 than
 32
 weeks’
 ges-
tation.
 Our
 data
 do
 not
 have
 sufficient
 power
 to
 determine
 whether
there
 is
 a
 gestational
 age
 prior
 to
 20
 weeks
 by
 which
 it
 is
 advisable
to
 cease
 marijuana
 use.
 Hence,
 at
 this
 stage
 we  recommend
 that
 it
is
 prudent
 to
 abstain
 from
 marijuana
 use
 during
 pregnancy.
Based
 on
 the
 current
 findings
 and
 some
 earlier
 reports
[17,22,24,36,37],
 it
 is
 likely
 that
 maternal
 marijuana
 use
 is
 an
independent
 risk
 factor
 for
 SPTB.
 It
 has
 been
 shown
 that
 the
active
 compound
 of
 marijuana
 (ı9-tetrahydrocannabinol)
 and
 its
metabolites
 are
 able
 to
 cross
 the
 placental
 barrier
 and
 thereby
 have
the
 potential
 to
 directly
 affect
 perinatal
 outcomes
 [38,39]. Whereas
the
 results
 from
 this
 study
 are
 in
 agreement
 with
 other
 studies,
it
 needs
 to
 be
 noted
 that
 a
 few
 American
 and
 a
 UK
 prospective
cohort
 studies
 did
 not
 find
 an
 association
 between
 marijuana
 use
and
 SPTB
 [28–30,40].
 However,
 these
 studies
 have
 a
 higher
 per-
centage
 (>40%)
 of
 black
 race,
 whereas
 there
 are
 89.9%
 Caucasians
in
 this
 study.
 Although
 the
 studies
 have
 also
 adjusted
 for
 ethnic-
ity,
 age,
 BMI,
 and
 other
 lifestyle
 factors,
 interaction
 tests
 were
 not
performed
 in
 the
 analysis
 to
 examine
 the
 interaction
 effects
 of
 mar-
ijuana
 use
 and
 cigarette
 smoking
 on
 pregnancy
 outcomes.

While
 African
 American
 ethnicity
 has
 been
 associated
 with
 an
increased
 risk
 of
 SPTB
 [41,42],
 it
 has
 also
 been
 commonly
 associ-
ated
 with
 lower
 socio-economic
 status.
 The
 relationship
 of
 low
 SEI
with
 pregnancy
 complications
 was
 apparent
 in
 this
 study,
 where
SEI
 was
 significantly
 negatively
 associated
 with
 PE,
 GHT,
 GDM,
 SGA,
and
 SPTB.
 When
 adjusted
 for
 age,
 BMI,
 cigarette
 smoking,
 and
 mar-
ijuana
 use,
 higher
 SEI
 was
 a
 protective
 factor,
 with
 a
 1–2%
 decrease
in
 the
 risk
 of
 PE
 per
 unit
 increase
 in
 SEI.
 Similar
 trends
 were
 also
seen
 in
 previously
 published
 SCOPE
 data
 [43,44].
 However,
 the
results
 from
 the
 current
 study
 showed
 no
 significant
 interaction
effects
 between
 marijuana
 use
 and
 SEI,
 suggesting
 that
 the
 asso-
ciation
 between
 marijuana
 use
 and
 SPTB
 was
 also
 independent
 of
socio-economic
 status.
Despite
 a
 borderline
 significance
 for
 alcohol
 consumption
 at
 15
weeks’
 gestation
 for
 PE
 risk,
 our
 results
 are
 consistent
 with
 a
 study
by
 Klonoff-Cohen
 et
 al.
 [45,46],
 which
 showed
 that
 maternal
 alco-
hol
 consumption
 does
 not
 appear
 to
 have
 a
 significant
 association
with
 preeclampsia.
 Alcohol
 consumption
 during
 first
 trimester
 was
not
 associated
 with
 SPTB,
 consistent
 with
 a
 previous
 SCOPE
 publi-
cation
 [46].
 However,
 continued
 alcohol
 consumption
 at
 20
 weeks’
gestation
 is
 a
 protective
 factor
 for
 SPTB,
 and
 a
 recent
 study
 by
Lundsberg
 et
 al.
 [47]
 also
 showed
 that
 alcohol
 consumption
 dur-
ing
 third
 trimester
 was
 associated
 with
 a
 decreased
 risk
 of
 PTB
but
 not
 when
 consumed
 during
 early
 pregnancy.
 The
 mechanism
of
 this
 effect
 is
 still
 unknown.
 However,
 as
 maternal
 alcohol
 con-
sumption
 may
 damage
 the
 fetus
 we
 cannot
 recommend
 it
 during
pregnancy
 and
 indeed
 the
 National
 Health
 and
 Medical
 Research
Council
 Guidelines
 recommend
 against
 its
 use
 in
 pregnancy
 [48].
Maternal
 cigarette
 smoking
 is
 typically
 considered
 to
 be
 a
 risk
factor
 for
 SPTB
 and
 SGA
 [49–54].
 Indeed,
 maternal
 cigarette
 smok-
ing
 at
 20
 weeks’
 gestation
 was
 significantly
 associated
 with
 risk
of
 SPTB
 and
 SGA
 in
 univariable
 tests,
 but
 no
 longer
 significant
 for
SPTB
 when
 adjusted
 for
 other
 factors,
 including
 BMI,
 SEI,
 age,
 and
marijuana.
 Similar
 results
 have
 been
 found
 previously
 in
 a
 study
by
 Dekker
 et
 al.
 [55],
 which
 incorporated
 multiple
 novel
 risk
 fac-
tors
 for
 SPTB.
 In
 the
 current
 study
 an
 association
 was
 seen
 between
smoking
 and
 SPTB
 (in
 univariable
 analysis),
 but
 cigarette
 smoking
was
 not
 found
 to
 be
 an
 independent
 risk
 factor
 for
 SPTB
 after
 adjust-
ment
 for
 marijuana
 use.
 Nevertheless,
 continued
 cigarette
 smoking
is
 a
 significant
 risk
 factor
 for
 many
 pregnancy
 complications
 includ-
ing
 stillbirth,
 placental
 abruption
 and
 SGA
 and
 women
 should
 be
encouraged
 to
 quit
 before
 or
 in
 early
 pregnancy
 [56].
The
 association
 between
 smoking
 and
 marijuana
 is
 often
 con-
sidered
 as
 an
 interaction
 effect
 for
 pregnancy
 complications,
 as
the
 majority
 of
 women
 who
 use
 marijuana
 also
 smoke
 cigarettes
[10,25,57].
 In
 fact,
 amongst
 women
 who
 used
 marijuana
 in
 the
SCOPE
 cohort,
 74%
 also
 smoked
 cigarettes.
 With
 a
 high
 concurrence
rate,
 the
 independent
 effect
 of
 marijuana
 on
 pregnancy
 outcomes
has
 generally
 been
 unrecognised
 and
 just
 considered
 to
 be
 sub-
sidiary,
 partly
 due
 to
 the
 low
 availability
 of
 data
 on
 marijuana
 use
compared
 to
 cigarette
 smoking
 for
 statistical
 analysis
 [36,57].
 How-
ever,
 our
 data
 from
 the
 SCOPE
 cohort,
 with
 316
 participants
 (5.62%)
who
 were
 marijuana
 users,
 demonstrate
 that
 the
 association
 of
marijuana
 use
 with
 SPTB
 is
 consistent
 across
 cigarette
 smokers
 and
non-smokers.
The
 consistent
 effect
 of
 marijuana
 use
 is
 also
 apparent
 when
analysing
 the
 effect
 of
 the
 estimated
 number
 of
 episodes
 of
 mar-
ijuana
 use
 during
 pregnancy
 on
 the
 length
 of
 gestation.
 While
there
 was
 a
 slight
 decrease
 in
 the
 predicted
 length
 of
 gestation
amongst
 smokers,
 the
 trend
 for
 smokers
 and
 non-smokers
 was
similar.
 In
 contrast,
 the
 predicted
 length
 of
 gestation
 for
 women
who
 continued
 to
 use
 marijuana
 at
 20
 weeks’
 gestation
 was
 signifi-
cantly
 decreased
 compared
 to
 those
 who
 ceased
 earlier
 in
 gestation,
regardless
 of
 smoking
 status.
 This
 is
 consistent
 with
 similar
 studies
which
 showed
 that
 marijuana
 use
 is
 associated
 with
 a
 decreased
length
 of
 gestation
 [26,27].
Furthermore,
 apart
 from
 a
 cigarette
 smoking-marijuana
 inter-
action,
 it
 is
 also
 well
 recognised
 that
 cigarette
 smoking
 and
 illicit
drug
 use
 are
 associated
 with
 low
 socio-economic
 status
 [57–60],
along
 with
 a
 complex
 inter-relationship
 with
 obesity,
 where
 smok-
ing
 cessation
 may
 also
 lead
 to
 obesity
 [57,61–63].
 As
 described
 in
many
 studies,
 the
 prevalence
 of
 cigarette
 smoking
 and
 obesity
 is
higher
 amongst
 those
 who
 are
 socio-economically
 disadvantaged,
and
 the
 incidence
 of
 SPTB
 is
 higher
 amongst
 women
 with
 lower
income
 and
 lower
 educational
 status
 [41,64],
 which
 may
 indicate
associations
 with
 other
 lifestyle
 risk
 factors.
Furthermore,
 if
 there
 was
 no
 maternal
 marijuana
 exposure,
 with
an
 estimated
 population
 attributable
 risk
 (PAR)
 of
 0.003
 for
 mari-
juana
 use,
 the
 incidence
 of
 SPTB
 would
 be
 expected
 to
 decrease
 by
3
 cases
 per
 1000
 pregnant
 women.
 With
 an
 overall
 rate
 of
 SPTB
 of
4.2%
 in
 this
 study,
 this
 represents
 an
 estimated
 6.2%
 reduction
 in
the
 incidence
 of
 SPTB
 in
 the
 population,
 i.e.
 about
 3
 out
 of
 50
 SPTB
cases
 would
 be
 attributed
 to
 marijuana
 use.
 If
 we
 consider
 the
 Aus-
tralian
 centre
 only,
 where
 any
 marijuana
 usage
 occurred
 in
 11.6%
 of
women
 compared
 to
 3.6–4.5%
 in
 the
 other
 centres,
 the
 estimated
PAR
 was
 0.009
 for
 marijuana
 use
 with
 an
 expected
 reduction
 of
SPTB
 of
 9
 cases
 per
 1000
 pregnant
 women,
 and
 a
 11.68%
 reduction
in
 the
 incidence
 of
 SPTB
 in
 this
 centre
 if
 women
 did
 not
 use
 mar-
ijuana.
 That
 is,
 in
 the
 Australian
 study
 centre,
 almost
 12%
 of
 SPTB
could
 be
 attributable
 to
 maternal
 marijuana
 use.
4.1.
 Strengths
 and
 limitations
A
 major
 strength
 of
 this
 study
 was
 its
 large
 international
 mul-
ticentre
 prospective
 cohort
 with
 excellent
 follow-up
 and
 complete
data
 available
 for
 this
 analysis.
 Women
 were
 recruited
 from
 a
clearly
 defined
 population
 of
 nulliparous
 women,
 with
 meticulous
data
 monitoring
 protocols
 to
 reduce
 data
 entry
 or
 transcription
errors
 and
 ensure
 the
 quality
 of
 data.
 While
 there
 are
 other
 stud-
ies
 that
 have
 examined
 the
 effect
 of
 marijuana
 use
 on
 adverse
pregnancy
 outcomes,
 interaction
 tests
 were
 not
 performed.
 Hence,
with
 complete
 quality
 data
 available
 from
 this
 study,
 interactions
between
 marijuana
 use
 and
 cigarette
 smoking
 status
 may
 be
 exam-
ined
 while
 also
 adjusting
 for
 potential
 confounders.
It
 needs
 to
 be
 noted
 that
 the
 number
 of
 SPTB
 cases
 amongst
women
 who
 reported
 marijuana
 use
 at
 20
 weeks’
 gestation
 is
 small
(n
 =
 11)
 even
 in
 this
 large
 cohort.

85
use
 and
 cigarette
 smoking
 status
 may
 be
 a
 potential
 limitation,
as
 it
 may
 be
 subject
 to
 participant
 recall
 bias.
 Furthermore,
 this
study
 was
 undertaken
 in
 a
 nulliparous
 cohort
 so
 it
 may
 be
 the
case
 that
 our
 findings
 apply
 only
 to
 nulliparous
 women.
 Although
medication
 for
 maternal
 asthma,
 thyroid
 disease,
 and
 PCOS
 were
recorded,
 we
 found
 no
 evidence
 of
 association
 with
 pregnancy
 out-
comes
 analysed
 in
 this
 study,
 therefore
 these
 were
 not
 included
 in
the
 analysis.
 Further
 research
 is
 required
 to
 confirm
 these
 findings,
and
 future
 studies
 should
 include
 appropriate
 corrections
 for
 the
various
 important
 confounders
 (e.g.
 smoking,
 BMI,
 ethnicity).

 Conclusion
In
 this
 large
 prospective
 cohort,
 maternal
 marijuana
 use
 had
a
 major
 contribution
 to
 SPTB
 and
 this
 association
 was
 consistent
for
 both
 cigarette
 smokers
 and
 non-smokers,
 with
 doubled
 odds
 in
women
 who
 used
 marijuana
 three
 months
 prior
 to
 or
 during
 preg-
nancy.
 For
 women
 who
 use
 marijuana
 during
 pregnancy,
 it
 should
be
 emphasised
 that
 stopping
 early
 in
 pregnancy
 should
 be
 encour-
aged
 since
 continued
 use
 of
 marijuana
 at
 20
 weeks
 of
 gestation
was
 associated
 with
 a
 five-fold
 increased
 risk
 of
 SPTB
 in
 this
 study
following
 adjustment
 for
 other
 confounders,
 including
 maternal
age,
 BMI,
 SEI,
 and
 cigarette
 smoking.
 In
 this
 cohort
 of
 nulliparous
women
 we
 estimate
 there
 would
 be
 an
 estimated
 6.2%
 reduction
in
 the
 incidence
 of
 SPTB
 if
 women
 were
 not
 exposed
 to
 marijuana
during
 pregnancy.
Preterm
 birth
 is
 increasing
 in
 developed
 nations,
 with
 attendant
increases
 in
 adverse
 infant
 outcomes,
 as
 well
 as
 psychological
 and
social
 impacts,
 and
 is
 of
 great
 concern
 to
 public
 health.
 The
 increas-
ing
 exposure
 to
 marijuana
 in
 women
 of
 reproductive
 age
 and
 its
contribution
 to
 the
 risk
 for
 preterm
 birth
 make
 it
 a
 modifiable
 tar-
get
 for
 intervention.
 In
 nations
 where
 authorities
 are
 considering
decriminalisation
 of
 marijuana
 or
 have
 already
 done
 so,
 the
 risks
to
 pregnant
 women
 and
 their
 babies
 need
 much
 greater
 consider-
ation.
