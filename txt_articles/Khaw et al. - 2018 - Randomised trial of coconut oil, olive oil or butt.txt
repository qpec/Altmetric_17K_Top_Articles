Introduction High dietary saturated fat intake is 
associated with higher blood concentrations of low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), an established risk factor 
for coronary heart disease. However, there is increasing 
interest in whether various dietary oils or fats with different 
fatty acid profiles such as extra virgin coconut oil may 
have different metabolic effects but trials have reported 
inconsistent results. We aimed to compare changes in 
blood lipid profile, weight, fat distribution and metabolic 
markers after four weeks consumption of 50 g daily of 
one of three different dietary fats, extra virgin coconut oil, 
butter or extra virgin olive oil, in healthy men and women 
in the general population.
Design Randomised clinical trial conducted over June and 
July 2017.
setting General community in Cambridgeshire, UK.
Participants Volunteer adults were recruited by the 
British Broadcasting Corporation through their websites. 
Eligibility criteria were men and women aged 50–75 
years, with no known history of cancer, cardiovascular 
disease or diabetes, not on lipid lowering medication, no 
contraindications to a high-fat diet and willingness to be 
randomised to consume one of the three dietary fats for 
4 weeks. Of 160 individuals initially expressing an interest 
and assessed for eligibility, 96 were randomised to one of 
three interventions; 2 individuals subsequently withdrew 
and 94 men and women attended a baseline assessment. 
Their mean age was 60 years, 67% were women and 98% 
were European Caucasian. Of these, 91 men and women 
attended a follow-up assessment 4 weeks later.
Intervention Participants were randomised to extra 
virgin coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter 
and asked to consume 50 g daily of one of these fats for 
4 weeks, which they could incorporate into their usual diet 
or consume as a supplement.
Main outcomes and measures The primary outcome 
was change in serum LDL-C; secondary outcomes were 
change in total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(TC and HDL-C), TC/HDL-C ratio and non-HDL-C; change in 
weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, per 
cent body fat, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting 
plasma glucose and C reactive protein.
results LDL-C concentrations were significantly 
increased on butter compared with coconut oil (+0.42, 
95% CI 0.19 to 0.65 mmol/L, P<0.0001) and with olive oil 
(+0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.60 mmol/L, P<0.0001), with no 
differences in change of LDL-C in coconut oil compared 
with olive oil (−0.04, 95% CI −0.27 to 0.19 mmol/L, 
P=0.74). Coconut oil significantly increased HDL-C 
compared with butter (+0.18, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.30 mmol/L) 
or olive oil (+0.16, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.28 mmol/L). Butter 
significantly increased TC/HDL-C ratio and non-HDL-C 
compared with coconut oil but coconut oil did not 
significantly differ from olive oil for TC/HDL-C and non-
HDL-C. There were no significant differences in changes 
in weight, BMI, central adiposity, fasting blood glucose, 
systolic or diastolic blood pressure among any of the three 
intervention groups.
Conclusions and relevance Two different dietary 
fats (butter and coconut oil) which are predominantly 
saturated fats, appear to have different effects on 
blood lipids compared with olive oil, a predominantly 
monounsaturated fat with coconut oil more comparable 
to olive oil with respect to LDL-C. The effects of different 
dietary fats on lipid profiles, metabolic markers and 
health outcomes may vary not just according to the 
general classification of their main component fatty acids 
as saturated or unsaturated but possibly according to 
different profiles in individual fatty acids, processing 
methods as well as the foods in which they are consumed 
or dietary patterns. These findings do not alter current 
dietary recommendations to reduce saturated fat intake 
in general but highlight the need for further elucidation of 
the more nuanced relationships between different dietary 
fats and health.
trial registration number NCT03105947; Results.
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► The randomised trial design comparing three dietary 
fat interventions minimised confounding and bias.
 
► There was good compliance and participants were 
from the general community in a ‘real life’ setting.
 
► Objective measures of outcome—blood biochemistry 
and anthropometry—were used, minimising bias.
 
► Participants were not blinded as to the intervention, 
and the intervention was relatively short term over 
4 weeks.

IntroDuCtIon 
This trial was conducted in the context of debate over 
longstanding dietary recommendations to reduce dietary 
fat intake for health. The Women’s Health Initiative 
reported no differences in cardiovascular disease in 
women randomised to low fat and usual diets over 8 years1 
while an intervention comparing a low-fat diet with a Medi-
terranean diet with extra virgin olive oil or nuts (PRED-
IMED) reported approximately 30% lower cardiovascular 
events in both Mediterranean diet arms after 4.8 years2; 
meta-analyses of observational studies and trials report 
inconsistent findings in the relationship between dietary 
saturated fatty acids and cardiovascular disease3 4 and 
the relationships of dairy fats including milk and butter 
with cardiovascular disease also being debated.5–7 Part 
of the debate relates to the increasing evidence that 
different individual fatty acids, such as the odd chain or 
even chain saturated fatty acids, or short, medium and 
long chain saturated fatty acids, may have different meta-
bolic pathways and subsequent potential health effects 
as well as the understanding that diet is more complex 
than individual nutrients or generic biochemical nutrient 
groups and that contextual factors such as foods and 
dietary patterns are important. The 2015–2020 US dietary 
guidelines8 now focus on foods and dietary patterns and 
while they recommend limiting saturated and trans fats, 
they no longer explicitly recommend limiting total fat. 
In this context therefore, there is renewed interest in the 
health effects of different fats and oils.
Extra virgin coconut oil has recently been promoted 
as a healthy oil. Though high in saturated fat, the 
main saturated fatty acid, lauric acid (c12:0), has been 
suggested to have different metabolic and hence health 
effects compared with other saturated fatty acids such 
as palmitic acid (c16:0), predominant in butter, palm 
oil and animal fat. In particular, it has been suggested 
that coconut oil does not raise total cholesterol (TC) or 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)  as much as 
butter. A recent review on coconut oil and cardiovascular 
risk factors in humans concluded that the evidence of an 
association between coconut oil consumption and blood 
lipids or cardiovascular risk was mostly poor quality.9 
While some small studies have been reported comparing 
coconut oil and butter, these have been small10 11 and 
none conducted in the UK where overall dietary patterns 
are different from Asia, USA or New Zealand where 
most trials have been conducted. The 2017 American 
Heart Association Presidential advisory on dietary fats and 
cardiovascular disease highlighted the paucity of evidence 
over the long-term health effects of saturated fats such as 
coconut oil and reinforced strongly recommendations to 
lower dietary saturated fat and replacement with unsat-
urated fat to lower LDL-C and prevent cardiovascular 
disease.12 In particular, they stated ‘because coconut oil 
increases LDL-C, a cause of cardiovascular disease and 
has no known off setting favourable effects, we advise 
against the use of coconut oil’.12
Though the PREDIMED study reported lower cardio-
vascular disease events in those randomised to extra virgin 
olive oil or added nuts,2 this trial reported no overall 
effects on LDL-C or TC for those on olive oil compared 
with the low-fat diet,13 results consistent with a review of 
intervention trials of high phenolic olive oil.14
We therefore aimed to examine whether in free 
living healthy men and women in the UK, we could 
observe differences in blood lipids after 1 month’s 
consumption of 50 g daily of one of three different fats 
within the context of their usual diet. Although this was 
a short-term trial that did not address cardiovascular 
disease events, blood lipids are a well established risk 
factor for coronary heart disease and the aim was to 
compare directly the effects of three different fats, extra 
virgin coconut oil, butter (both predominantly saturated 
fats) with extra virgin olive oil (monounsaturated fat) on 
blood lipid profiles and metabolic measures, in a prag-
matic trial using amounts feasible in daily diets.
MethoDs
study population
Participants were volunteers living in the general commu-
nity predominantly in the Cambridgeshire area, recruited 
through British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) adver-
tising in May and June 2017. Eligible participants were 
men or women aged between 50 and 75 years who did 
not have a known medical history of heart disease, stroke, 
cancer or diabetes and who were not taking medication 
for lowering blood lipids such as statins. They had to be 
willing to be randomised to consume 50 g daily of one 
of the designated fats for four weeks and not have any 
contraindications to eating a high-fat diet such as gall 
bladder or bowel problems. Of 160 individuals expressing 
an interest, 96 were eligible and randomised to the inter-
vention, 2 withdrew prior to the start of the study and 94 
attended a baseline assessment.
Allocation to intervention
Participants were assigned a unique study identification 
number (ID). These ID numbers were randomised by 
computer  generated allocation conducted by an inde-
pendent statistician separately in men and women, 
into one of three parallel intervention arms approxi-
mately equal in size: extra virgin coconut oil, butter or 
extra virgin olive oil.
Intervention
Participants attending the baseline assessment, at the 
end of their appointment, received 1 month’s supply 
of one of the three different dietary fats to which they 
had been randomly allocated: extra virgin coconut oil or 
butter or extra virgin olive oil. The BBC study organiser 
was given an ID list with the random allocation to the fats/
oils and was responsible for giving each participant their 
supply of fat/oils. They were asked to eat 50 g of these 
fats daily for 4 weeks and given measuring cups for the

50 mL fat and oils: butter was prepacked in 20 g and 30 g 
portions. They were asked to continue with their usual diet 
and either incorporate the fat or oil into their daily diet to 
substitute for other fats or oils or they could eat these fats 
as a supplement. They also had information sheets with 
suggestions for how the fats could be consumed including 
recipes. The fats selected were standard products avail-
able from supermarkets bought from suppliers; organic 
extra virgin coconut oil, organic unfiltered extra virgin 
olive oil and organic unsalted butter. Samples of the oils/
fats used in the trial were sent to a reference laboratory: 
the West Yorkshire Analytic Services, a UKAS accredited 
testing service for food composition.
Assessments
Participants attended two assessments at a community 
centre in Cambridge: one at baseline before the start 
of the intervention in June 2017 and one at the end of 
4 weeks in July 2017. Prior to their initial assessment, they 
were asked to fill in a short questionnaire about their 
health and lifestyle including physical activity and diet as 
well as complete an online 24 hours dietary assessment 
questionnaire with automated nutrient intake estimation, 
developed in Oxford, the DietWebQ.15 All assessments 
were conducted between 08:00 and 12:30 hours. Partic-
ipants were all fasted for a minimum of 4 hours prior 
to attending the assessment; the majority were fasted 
overnight. They had height and waist circumference 
measured to a standardised protocol in light clothing 
without shoes and blood pressure measured using an 
automated OMRON device after being seated resting 
for 5 min. The mean of two readings for blood pressure, 
height and waist was used for analysis. Weight and per cent 
body fat were measured using a Tanita body composi-
tion monitor. All measurements were conducted by two 
trained observers unaware of allocation to the oils/fats. 
Participants gave a 20 mL blood sample which was stored 
in a 4°C refrigerator and then sent to the laboratory by 
courier for same day sample processing and storage for 
later analysis.
After 4 weeks at the end of the intervention, they 
attended again for a follow-up assessment where the same 
measurements of height, waist circumference, blood 
pressure, weight and per cent body fat were conducted, 
and another fasting 20 mL blood sample taken. Measure-
ments were recorded on new forms and observers and 
participants did not have access to the measurements 
taken at the baseline visit. Just prior to this visit, partic-
ipants were asked to fill in again the online 24-hour 
DietWebQ. Participants also filled in short question-
naire about their experiences on the intervention fats. 
This included a question about their overall experience 
of consuming the assigned oil/fat in the study where 
they were asked on average, over the past 4 weeks whether 
they felt mostly the same as usual, mostly felt better than 
usual or mostly felt worse than usual with an open-ended 
section for comments including side effects and overall 
compliance with consuming the fats which they were 
asked to self-rate between 0% and 100%. They were also 
asked whether they changed their type, level or frequency 
of physical activity in the past month since being in the 
study and had three options, no overall change in activity, 
increase in activity or decrease in activity.
Blood samples were identified only by a study ID 
number and were processed using standard proto-
cols and assayed in two batches at the end of the base-
line and follow-up assessments in the Core Biochemical 
Assay Laboratory (CBAL) Cambridge University Hospi-
tals which has UKAS Clinical Pathology Accreditation; 
blood samples from individuals on different interven-
tions were thus all assayed in the same batch. The labora-
tory assays were conducted in a blinded fashion without 
any indication of the allocated intervention. Cholesterol 
(TC) and triglycerides were measured using enzymatic 
assays,16 17 high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) 
was measured using a homogenous accelerator selec-
tive detergent assay automated on the Siemens Dimen-
sion RxL analyser and LDL-C was calculated from the 
triglyceride, HDL and cholesterol concentrations as 
described in the Friedewald formula [LDL = Choles-
terol - HDL – (Triglycerides/2.2)].18 Total to HDL-C ratio 
was computed, and non-HDL-C was computed as TC 
minus HDL-C.
Plasma glucose was measured using the hexokinase-glu-
cose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase method, and high-sen-
sitivity human C reactive protein was assayed using an 
automated colourimetric immunoassay: Siemens Dimen-
sion CCRP CardioPhase  high-sensitivity CRP.
trial outcomes
The trial was registered in April 2017 with clinical trials 
registration: NCT03105947. The primary outcome of the 
trial was change in LDL-C from baseline to follow-up. 
Secondary outcomes were change in each of the following 
variables from baseline to follow-up: TC, HDL-C, 
triglycerides; ratio of TC/HDL-C, non-HDL-C, fasting 
blood glucose, C reactive protein, weight, body mass 
index (BMI), body fat %, waist circumference, systolic 
blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure.
statistical analysis
The study aimed to recruit a total of 90 participants: 30 
individuals per group would provide approximately 80% 
power to detect a difference in mean within-person 
change in LDL-C (baseline to follow-up) comparing pairs 
of randomised groups (butter vs coconut oil and butter vs 
olive oil) of approximately 0.5 mmol/L, assuming a SD of 
LDL-C of 1.04 mmol/L19 and a correlation between base-
line and follow-up values of 0.7920 incorporated using the 
method described by Borm et al.21 With 2 primary pair-
wise comparisons, the significance level for each compar-
ison was set to 2.5%.
This magnitude of difference was what can be esti-
mated from metabolic ward studies in which replacement 
of 10% dietary calories from saturated fat is associ-
ated with 0.52 mmol/L cholesterol difference22 though

this did not specify the food sources of saturated fats, and 
a small intervention trial (n=28) comparing butter and 
coconut oil with sunflower oil.10
Baseline characteristics were summarised separately 
for each randomised group. As recommended by 
CONSORT, no P values were calculated for this table. 
The primary analysis used an intention-to-treat (ITT) 
population, which included all individuals in the group 
to which they were randomised, regardless of the extent 
to which they adhered to the intervention. A secondary 
analysis used a per protocol (PP) population. This was a 
subset of the ITT population consisting of those individ-
uals who adhered to the intervention. Participants who 
reported >75% adherence when asked at the follow-up 
visit were included in the PP population.
For each outcome, a P value was calculated to compare 
the three randomised groups using a linear regression 
model, in which change from baseline was the outcome 
and including a dummy variable for randomised group 
and the baseline value of the outcome variable as covari-
ates, that is, an analysis of covariance model. Differences 
between each pair of randomised groups and 95% CIs 
were also estimated from a similar model.
Patient and public involvement
The BBC originally proposed the idea of a study to 
examine claims about the health benefits of coconut oil 
in response to public interest; the study would be part 
of their ‘Trust me, I’m a doctor’ series. The study was 
designed as a randomised trial with participants from the 
general community in discussion with the BBC.

through BBC website advertising. From 160 individ-
uals initially expressing an interest and after exclusion 
criteria, 96 individuals were randomised and invited to 
a baseline assessment session in June 2017. Two individ-
uals subsequently withdrew and 94 individuals attended 
the baseline assessment session in June 2017. At the 
4-weekfollow-up assessment in July 2017, 91 individuals 
attended; three individuals did not attend follow-up indi-
cating personal circumstances.
Table 1 shows descriptive characteristics for the partic-
ipants at the baseline assessment according to the allo-
cation to dietary oils/fats. Two thirds of the participants 
were women and the mean age overall was 60 years.
Table 2 shows mean changes in the primary and 
secondary outcomes at the 4-week follow-up within each 
randomised group and comparisons between each pair of 
randomised groups. LDL-C concentrations were signifi-
cantly increased on butter compared with coconut oil 
(+0.42, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.65 mmol/L, P<0.0001) and olive 
oil (+0.38 L, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.60 mmol/L, P<0.0001), 
with no differences in change of LDL-C in coconut 
oil compared with olive oil (−0.04, 95% CI −0.27 to 
0.19 mmol/L, 
P=0.74). 
Coconut 
oil 
significantly 
increased HDL-C compared to butter (+0.18 95% CI 
0.06 to 0.30 mmol/L) or olive oil (+0.16, 95% CI 0.03 to 
0.28 mmol/L).
Butter significantly increased the cholesterol/HDL-C 
ratio compared with coconut oil (+0.36, 95% CI 0.18 to 
0.54) and olive oil (+0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.40) and also 
increased non-HDL-C compared with coconut oil (+0.39, 
95% CI 0.16 to 0.62 mmol/L) and olive oil (+0.39 (95% 
CI 0.16 to 0.62) but coconut oil did not significantly 
differ from olive oil for change in cholesterol/HDL-C 
ratio (−0.14, 95% CI −0.33 to 0.05) or non-HDL-C (0.002, 
95% CI −0.23 to 0.24 mmol/L).
Coconut oil also significantly lowered C reactive 
protein in comparison with olive oil (−0.58, 95% CI 
−1.12 to –0.04 mg/L) but not compared with butter. There 
were no significant differences in changes in weight, 
BMI, central adiposity, fasting blood glucose, systolic or 
diastolic blood pressure among any of the three inter-
vention groups. For weight, for example, the estimated 
mean(SD) changes in weight were +0.27 (0.77) kg, 0.04 
(1.00) kg and −0.04 (0.84) kg for coconut oil, butter and 
olive oil, respectively. Adjusting for age, sex and body 
mass index did not materially alter the results (online 
supplementary table 1).
Figure 2 shows the difference in the primary outcome 
(LDL-C) between each pair of randomised groups 
in the 91 individuals who attended baseline and 
follow-up. Figures 3–5 show the differences in secondary 
outcomes comparing butter versus coconut oil, coconut 
oil versus olive oil and butter versus olive oil, respectively. 
For comparability, the differences are reported in units 
of baseline SD for the different outcomes in figures 3–5.
Self-reported compliance was high: 87% of participants 
reported more than 75% compliance with the inter-
vention over the 4 weeks which was similar among the 
groups (86% coconut oil, 88% butter and 85% olive oil). 
Secondary analyses on the 82 participants reporting more 
than 75% compliance showed similar results (not shown). 
Reported experience consuming the fats was similar 
between groups: 57%, 66% and 60% reported feeling no 
different, 18%, 6% and 13% reported feeling better and 
25%, 27% and 23% reported feeling worse in the coconut 
oil, butter and olive oil groups, respectively. Comparison 
of dietary intake using the 24-hour DietWebQ showed 
similar levels of dietary intake across intervention groups 
at baseline. Following the intervention, total fat intake 
increased in all intervention groups but estimates for 
absolute intakes of carbohydrate, protein and alcohol did 
not differ between intervention groups (table 3). Most of 
the participants reported no changes in usual physical 
activity (79%, 73% and 89% no change; 14%, 15% and 
4% increased usual physical activity and 7%, 12% and 7% 
decreased usual physical activity in the coconut oil, butter 
and olive oil groups, respectively). In a posthoc explor-
atory analysis, exclusion of individuals who reported 
increasing usual physical activity had little effect on signif-
icant differences between interventions for LDL-C and 
HDL-C and did not alter the findings for weight change 
(online supplementary table 2).
Online supplementary appendix 1 shows the fatty acid 
composition of the three oils/fats used in the interven-
tion. Coconut oil was 94% saturated fatty acids, of which 
the main components were lauric acid C12:0 (48%), 
myristic acid C14:0 (19%) and palmitic acid C16:0 (9%). 
Butter was 66% saturated fatty acids, of which the main 
components were palmitic acid C16:0 (28%), stearic acid 
C18:0 (12%) and myristic acid C14:0 (11%). Olive oil 
was 19% saturated fatty acids, mainly palmitic acid C16 
(15%) with stearic acid C18:0 (3%) and 68% monoun-
saturates with the main component being oleic acid 
C18:1n9 (64%). These profiles are very similar to those 
reported from other studies.9
DIsCussIon
In this trial, middle-aged men and women living in the 
general community were randomly allocated to consume 
50 g extra virgin coconut oil or 50 g butter or 50 g extra 
virgin olive oil for 4 weeks. We observed at the end of the 
trial significantly different changes in LDL-C and HDL-C 
concentrations between the three intervention groups; 
in pairwise comparisons, coconut oil did not signifi-
cantly raise LDL-C concentrations compared with olive 
oil while butter significantly raised LDL-C concentrations 
compared with both coconut oil and olive oil. Coconut 
oil significantly raised HDL-C concentrations compared 
with both butter and olive oil. Butter also significantly 
raised cholesterol/HDL-C ratio and non-HDL-C more 
than both coconut oil and olive oil but there were no 
differences between coconut oil and olive oil for changes 
in cholesterol/HDL-C and non-HDL-C.
There were no significant differences in weight or 
BMI change, change in central adiposity as measured

by waist circumference or per cent body fat. There 
were also no significant differences in change in fasting 
glucose or systolic and diastolic blood pressure among 
the three different fat interventions. In pairwise compar-
ison, coconut oil significantly lowered C reactive protein 
compared to olive oil but there were no significant differ-
ences between coconut oil and butter for C reactive 
protein.
The results were somewhat surprising for a number 
of reasons. Coconut oil is predominantly (approxi-
mately 90%) saturated fat which is generally held to have 
an adverse effect on blood lipids by increasing blood 
LDL-C concentrations. However, the saturated fatty acid 
profiles of different dietary fats vary substantially; coconut 
oil is predominantly (around 48%) lauric acid (12:0) 
compared with butter (66% saturated fat) which is about 
40% palmitic (16:0) and stearic (18:0) acids, leading 
to suggestions that coconut oil may not have the same 
health effects as other foods high in saturated fat.9 Never-
theless, though reviews on coconut oil and cardiovascular 
disease risk factors have concluded that the evidence 
of an association between coconut oil consumption 
and blood lipids or cardiovascular risk was mostly poor 
quality,9 trials have generally reported that coconut oil 
consumption raises LDL-C in comparison to polyunsat-
urated oil such as safflower oil, though not as much in 
comparison to butter.10 11
Based on three randomised crossover trials of good 
scientific quality, one trial reported butter increased 
LDL-C more than coconut oil which raised LDL-C more 
compared with safflower oil10; a second reported that 
coconut oil raised LDL-C more than beef fat which raised 
LDL-C more than safflower oil23 and a third reported 
that coconut oil raised LDL-C more than palm oil which 
raised LDL-C more than olive oil.24 The current study 
observed that butter raised LDL-C more than coconut 
oil but that coconut oil did not differ from olive oil. 
Two studies showed higher HDL-C with coconut oil 
compared with other fats whether beef fat, safflower oil 
or olive oil.23 24 Thus far, the current results are consistent 
with previous studies indicating that butter raises LDL-C 
more than coconut oil and also that coconut oil also raises 
HDL-C. However, the present study is an exception in not 
finding any increase in LDL-C compared with an unsatu-
rated oil, in this case, olive oil. In this trial, the difference 
of 0.33 mmol/L in LDL-C on butter compared with olive 
oil is consistent with previous studies.25
This is the largest trial reported to date on coconut 
oil and lipids apart from a recent study of 200 individ-
uals with established coronary heart disease comparing 
coconut oil with sunflower oil over 2 years that reported 
no differences in blood lipids but virtually all the partici-
pants were on statin therapy26 which makes findings diffi-
cult to interpret.
Direct comparisons between studies are problematic 
because of different oils used; we used extra virgin olive 
oil as a comparison group rather than a polyunsaturated 
oil such as safflower or sunflower oil, for feasibility reasons 
of likely participant compliance with the requirement 
for 50 g intake daily. The PREDIMED study reported 
no significant difference in change in LDL-C or TC 
but significant lowering of the cholesterol/HDL-C ratio 
in the Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin 
olive oil compared with a low-fat diet.2 13 A recent review 
reported that high phenolic olive oil does not modify the 
lipid profile compared with its low phenolic counterpart14 
though other studies have reported that extra virgin olive 
oil decreases LDL-C directly measured as concentrations 
of apoB-100 and the total number of LDL particles as 
assessed by NMR spectroscopy.27 28 We therefore expected 
coconut oil would raise LDL-C compared with olive oil, 
but in the current study, we observed no evidence of an 
overall average increase in LDL-C in individuals allocated 
either to the coconut oil or olive oil intervention.
Lack of compliance with consuming the dietary 
fat would lead to no differences between groups and 
hence explain the lack of differences in LDL-C between 
coconut oil and olive oil groups. However, in this group 
of volunteers, reported compliance was high and did not 
differ between groups; in addition, those in the coconut 
oil group had significantly greater increases in HDL-C 
compared with those allocated to olive oil or butter, so 
lack of compliance is unlikely to be an explanation.
The predominant fatty acid in coconut oil, lauric 
acid (C12:0) as well as myristic acid (C14:0) are 
medium chain fatty acids that are rapidly absorbed, taken 
up by the liver and oxidised to increase energy expendi-
ture which is a possible explanation for why coconut oil 
may have different effects compared with other satu-
rated fats29. It is also possible that differences could 
be attributed to the use of extra virgin preparations of 
coconut oil rather than standard coconut oil; different 
methods of preparation such as the chilling method 
for virgin coconut oil compared with refined, bleached 
and deodorised coconut oil may influence phenolic 
compounds and antioxidant activity,30 thus, processing 
of oils changes their composition, biological properties 
and consequent potential metabolic effects. The varia-
tions in possible health effects resulting from variations 
in processing of different fats is well documented in the

large literature on hydrogenation of polyunsaturated oils 
to make solid margarines which may increase harmful 
trans fats.31. In this context, it is notable that the major 
trial (PREDIMED) reporting reduction in cardiovascular 
risk with a Mediterranean diet used extra virgin olive oil,2 
while other studies which reported null findings with 
olive oil may not have always specified the product used.14
There was no evidence of difference between groups in 
mean weight, BMI, per cent body fat or central adiposity 
at the end of this trial; however, these were secondary 
endpoints for which the trial was not specifically powered. 
Nevertheless, the estimated 95% CI around mean weight 
differences at the end for the trial were not large. 
The participants were asked to consume 50 g of fat or oils 
daily. They could do this in the context of their usual diet 
by substituting for their usual fats or by consuming these 
as a supplement. In practice, most participants reported 
finding it difficult to substitute the different fats or oils 
for cooking in their usual diet and usually consumed these 
as a supplement. These fats if taken in addition to their 
usual diet would have been approximately 450 additional 
calories daily, which if consistently taken over 4 weeks 
might be expected to be nearly 13 000 additional calories 
resulting in likely weight gain of 1–2 kg. This information 
was provided in the information sheet with the informed 
consent for participants. While it is possible that partici-
pants may have consciously changed behaviours to main-
tain body weight such as reducing their other dietary 
intake because of the additional fat or being more physi-
cally active, many participants reported that the high-fat 
diet resulted in feeling full and eating less.
It is also possible that even though this was a 
randomised trial, in an unblinded study, participants may 
have changed behaviours differentially in the different 
intervention groups resulting in differences in lipids or 
lack of differences in weight observed rather than being 
attributed to the dietary fat interventions. The majority 
of the participants reported no change in usual physical 
activity though slightly more participants in the coconut 
oil and butter groups reported increasing usual physical 
activity (14% and 15%, respectively) compared with 4% 
in the olive oil group. Nevertheless exclusion of all indi-
viduals reporting increased usual physical activity from 
the analyses did not change the findings. Dietary factors

apart from fat most likely to influence HDL-C, total 
alcohol intake or change in alcohol intake did not differ 
significantly between intervention groups and in fact 
alcohol intake decreased slightly during the trial which 
would not explain any increases in HDL-C observed. 
There is therefore no evidence to suggest that differences 
in lipids or lack of differences in weight change were likely 
to be attributed to differential changes in behaviour.
The main strengths of this study are the randomised 
design with high completion rate (91/94 individuals 
returned to follow-up) and self-reported dietary compli-
ance (nearly 90% participants with over 75% adherence) 
over 4 weeks. This is also larger than most trials reported 
with the exception of the trial in India in individuals with 
heart disease most of whom were taking statins26. 
The current trial by contrast was conducted in individuals 
in the general population.
This trial has limitations. It was a short-term trial of 
4 weeks intervention, so we are unable to know what 
would have happened if the intervention had continued 
for a longer period. Moreover, the current findings only 
apply to the intermediate metabolic (lipid) risk markers 
and cannot be extended to findings for clinical endpoints.
It was designed as a pragmatic trial in free living indi-
viduals rather than a controlled metabolic ward trial such 
that individuals were asked only to consume the 50 g 
of allocated fat or oil daily. As this was a ‘real-world’ study, 
we made no attempt to control other aspects of their usual 
diet in particular, total energy intake. For this reason, our 
results cannot be taken to reflect what would happen 
when the only change to a diet is the substitution of one 
fat with another (eg, replacing butter with coconut oil 
or replacing butter with olive oil). Individuals may have 
changed their behaviours in different ways to accom-
modate this additional fat, whether by modifying other 
aspects of their diet for instance, increasing foods such 
as bread and potatoes or salads to eat with the fats or 
consciously reducing other food intake or changing phys-
ical activity patterns to control energy balance. Neverthe-
less, this trial is more reflective of real-life situations.

While self-reported compliance was high, this was 
subjective and we did not measure the blood fatty acid 
profile in participants following the intervention for an 
objective biomarker of compliance. Nevertheless, we did 
observe differential changes in blood lipids during the 
intervention.
The generalisability of the findings to the wider popu-
lation is also unclear. The volunteers were clearly highly 
selected to be willing to participate in such a study and 
also likely to be healthier than the general population, as 
for ethical reasons we excluded those with known preva-
lent cardiovascular disease, cancer or diabetes and also 
those on any lipid lowering medication or other contrain-
dications to a high-fat diet. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that 
the effect of these dietary fats in this group of individuals 
recruited from the general population would be biologi-
cally different from the general population.
Implications
We focused on LDL-C for the primary endpoint as the 
causal relationship between LDL-C concentrations and 
coronary heart disease risk is well established, with about 
a 15% increase in coronary heart disease risk per 
1 mmol/L increase in LDL-C concentrations and reduc-
tion of LDL-C cholesterol lowers coronary heart disease 
risk.32 Increase in LDL-C concentrations has been the 
main mechanism through which dietary saturated fat is 
believed to increase heart disease risk, though other path-
ways have been postulated. However, it is notable that 
some Mediterranean diet interventions such as the Lyon 
heart study (alpha linolenic acid)33 or PREDIMED (extra 
virgin olive oil)2 which have been reported to reduce 
cardiovascular risk in secondary and primary prevention 
may have effects through other pathways such as inflam-
mation or endothelial function.34 35 Whatever the mecha-
nisms, the evidence from prospective studies is consistent 
and strong that substitution of saturated fats by unsatu-
rated fats is beneficial for cardiovascular risk.36
The results of this study indicate that two different 
dietary fats (coconut oil and butter), which are predom-
inantly saturated fats, appear to have different effects

on blood lipids compared with olive oil, a predomi-
nantly monounsaturated fat. The effects of different 
dietary fats on lipid profiles, metabolic markers and health 
outcomes may vary not just according to the general clas-
sification of their main component fatty acids as satu-
rated or unsaturated but possibly according to different 
profiles in individual fatty acids, processing methods as 
well as the foods in which they are consumed or dietary 
patterns. There is increasing evidence that associations 
of saturated fatty acids with health outcomes may vary 
according to whether they are odd or even chain satu-
rated fatty acids or their chain length.37–39 Indeed, while 
overall the evidence indicates the substitution of dietary 
saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats is beneficial for 
coronary heart disease risk40 heterogeneity in findings 
from observational studies and trials may reflect different 
dietary sources of fats.4 41 As the Joint FAO/WHO 2008 
Expert Consultation on Fats and Fatty Acids in Human 
Nutrition comments:
‘There are inherent limitations with the convention of grouping 
fatty acids based only on number of double bonds…major groups 
of fatty acids are associated with different health effects…indi-
vidual fatty acids within each broad classification may have 
unique biological properties or effects…Intakes of individual 
fatty acids differ across world depending on predominant food 
sources of total fats and oils.’ The associations with health 
endpoints may well vary depending on the food sources.
In this trial, extra virgin coconut oil was similar to olive 
oil and did not raise LDL-C in comparison with butter. 
The current short-term trial on an intermediate cardiovas-
cular disease risk factor, LDL-C, does not provide evidence 
to modify existing prudent recommendations to reduce 
saturated fat in the diet as emphasised in most consensus 
recommendations8 12 and dietary guidelines should be 
based on a range of criteria.42 However, the findings 
highlight the need for further elucidation of the more 
nuanced relationships between different dietary fats and 
health. There is increasing evidence that to understand

the relationship between diet and health, we need to go 
beyond simplistic associations between individual nutri-
ents and health outcomes and examine foods and dietary 
patterns as a whole. In particular, present day diets with 
high intakes of processed foods now incorporate many 
fats and oils such as soya bean oil, palm oil and coconut 
oil which have not been previously widely used in Western 
societies and not well studied. The relationships between 
different dietary fats, particularly some of the now more 
commonly used fats, and health endpoints such as cardio-
vascular disease events need to be better established.
