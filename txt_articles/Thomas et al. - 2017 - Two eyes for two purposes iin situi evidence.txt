The light environment of the mesopelagic realm of the ocean changes with
both depth and viewer orientation, and this has probably driven the high
diversity of visual adaptations found among its inhabitants. The mesopela-
gic ‘cockeyed’ squids of family Histioteuthidae have unusual eyes, as the left
and right eyes are dimorphic in size, shape and sometimes lens pigmenta-
tion. This dimorphism may be an adaptation to the two different sources
of light in the mesopelagic realm, with the large eye oriented upward to
view objects silhouetted against the dim, downwelling sunlight and the
small eye oriented slightly downward to view bioluminescent point sources.
We used in situ video footage from remotely operated vehicles in the
Monterey Submarine Canyon to observe the orientation behaviour of 152
Histioteuthis heteropsis and nine Stigmatoteuthis dofleini. We found evidence
for upward orientation in the large eye and slightly downward orientation
in the small eye, which was facilitated by a tail-up oblique body orientation.
We also found that 65% of adult H. heteropsis (n ¼ 69) had yellow pigmenta-
tion in the lens of the larger left eye, which may be used to break the
counterillumination camouflage of their prey. Finally, we used visual mod-
elling to show that the visual returns provided by increasing eye size are
much higher for an upward-oriented eye than for a downward-oriented
eye, which may explain the development of this unique visual strategy.
This article is part of the themed issue ‘Vision in dim light’.
1. Introduction
The mesopelagic region of the deep sea (200–1000 m depth) is a dim to dark
habitat, yet it contains the highest diversity of visual adaptations in the sea,
indicating that vision remains important at these depths [1]. Two primary
sources of light are available for mesopelagic vision: sunlight and biolumines-
cence. These light sources differ in both their spatial organizations and how
they change in visual detectability with depth and viewer orientation [2].
This makes the relatively dark environment of the mesopelagic region a poten-
tially fertile environment for eye evolution, as small changes in depth or viewer
orientation may have large impacts on the visual scene encountered by an eye.
Dim, downwelling sunlight creates spatially extended scenes, where light
reaches the eye from many different directions at once and the resulting image
falls across multiple receptors. In dim light, these scenes are low in contrast and
typically require high absolute sensitivity for detection. In comparison, biolumi-
nescence typically functions as a high-contrast point source and thus calls for
higher resolution in order to localize the emitted light [2]. As a result, while a
larger eye will always be better for seeing either type of light, the optimal balance
in trade-offs between sensitivity and resolution in an eye changes depending on
which light source is being viewed [1].

 The colour, intensity and spatial distribution of underwater
light changes rapidly with depth. Downwelling sunlight
attenuates exponentially, decreasing by roughly 1.5 orders of
magnitude every 100 m in clear oceanic waters [3]. Addition-
ally, absorption and scattering cause sunlight to become
nearly monochromatic (lmax ¼ 480 nm), more diffuse and
more vertically symmetric with depth [4,5]. Like all emitted
light, bioluminescence has highest contrast against a black back-
ground, so as downwelling sunlight decreases and limits the
potential for viewing extended scenes, the contrast of biolumi-
nescent emissions from mesopelagic organisms simultaneously
increases [2].
The directionality of the mesopelagic light field makes
viewer orientation another important factor in vision. Orien-
tation determines not only the intensity of the background
light reaching the eye, but also how the brightness of a visual
target attenuates relative to the brightness of the background
[6]. In particular, extended scenes produced by downwelling
sunlight are easiest to detect when eyes are oriented directly
upward. However, optimal detection of bioluminescence
occurs where sunlight is minimized, so downward viewing
angles increase the contrast of bioluminescent signals [2].
The change in visual scene that occurs with depth and
viewer orientation and the contrasting impacts on the detection
of extended scenes versus bioluminescence pose a major chal-
lenge to vision in the dim light of the mesopelagic realm. The
histioteuthids are a family of mesopelagic squids that appear
to have adapted to this challenge with a novel solution. Histio-
teuthids have dimorphic eyes, where the left eye can be more
than twice the diameter of the right eye [7]. Upon hatching,
paralarvae have small, bilaterally symmetrical eyes. However,
the left eye enlarges during development of the juvenile to the
extent that it pushes the head out of alignment with the mantle
in some species [8]. While the smaller right eye maintains a
typical hemispherical shape, the left eye becomes semi-tubular
[8,9]. This dimorphism continues into the optic lobes, as the left
lobe can be twice as large as the right [10,11]. Additionally, the
lens in each histioteuthid eye can be differently pigmented,
yielding divergent filtering effects on the light reaching each
retina [9,11,12].
Early hypotheses predicted that the dimorphic histio-
teuthid eyes were adapted to the differing light levels in
shallow versus deep water [9,13]. However, evidence that
some histioteuthids exhibit diel vertical migration drew this
into question, as occupying deeper water during the day and
ascending shallower only at night would preclude bright
light exposure [8,14]. An alternative hypothesis was based on
angled ventral histioteuthid photophores thought to be used
for counterillumination camouflage. In order to orient these
photophores downward, histioteuthids were predicted to
orient in a tail-up posture with the body axis at a 458 angle
and the head twisted so that the large left eye orients upward
to view objects silhouetted against the dim downwelling sun-
light, while the smaller eye orients slightly downward to
optimally detect flashes of bioluminescence [8]. This prediction
has never been tested in situ, in part due to the inaccessibility of
the deep-sea environment and the scarcity of live observations
of midwater squids.
Histioteuthidae currently comprises 18 species: 15 in His-
tioteuthis and three in Stigmatoteuthis [15,16]. Our study
targeted two species that partially overlap in both geographic
and depth ranges: a large sample of Histioteuthis heteropsis,
and a smaller sample of Stigmatoteuthis dofleini (figure 1).
We used over 25 years of in situ deep-sea video footage to
determine (i) whether the large eye orients upward and the
small eye downward, (ii) whether consistent postures and
body orientations facilitate eye orientations and (iii) how
lens pigmentation varies between eyes and individuals. We
then used visual modelling to investigate the implications
that the observed eye orientations and depths have for detec-
tion of extended scenes versus bioluminescent point sources
in each eye.
2. Material and methods
(a) Study system
We used high-resolution in situ observations from the Monterey
Submarine Canyon (Monterey Bay, CA, USA) from archived remo-
tely operated vehicle (ROV) video footage at the Monterey Bay
Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI). We analysed 152 encoun-
ters with H. heteropsis and nine encounters with S. dofleini,
representing all histioteuthid sightings in MBARI’s Video Annota-
tion and Reference System from 1989 through July 2015 (figure 1)
[17]. We categorized individuals as juveniles or adults based on
morphological features such as transparency, relative arm length
and fin dynamics (figure 2a) [7]. Owing to the vastness of the habi-
tat and dynamic movement of water masses, it is unlikely that any
observations were of the same individual, so we treat each encoun-
ter independently. For orientation measurements, we assumed
that the top of the video frame was parallel with the ocean surface
because MBARI ROVs are engineered to sit in a stable, horizontal
position in the midwater. Finally, we assumed that observed pos-
tures
and
eye
orientations
were
representative
of
natural
behaviour, though the presence of the ROV and lights may disturb
the animals.
(b) Eye orientations
We defined eye orientation as the absolute angle that the centre
of the visual field deviated from an upward vertical position
(figure 3a, left). In other words, an eye looking directly up
would be oriented at 08 and an eye looking directly down
would be at 1808. We determined the centre of the visual field
by taking a still frame the first time we had a view perpendicular
to the visual axis (a direct side view of the eye and lens), and then
bisecting the two-dimensional image of the exposed lens. We
measured eye orientation to the nearest 58 for each eye in each
encounter when possible. This only occurred in a subset of
video observations, and for some individuals we could only
measure one eye.
(c) Posture and body orientation
We recorded initial body posture, which we divided into two
categories: ‘J-pose’ (figure 2a) and ‘Straight Arms’ (figure 2b).
In J-pose, the arms were curled up dorsally towards the head
and mantle, as is seen in many other cephalopods [18–23]. In
Straight Arms, the arms were extended and held together in
line with the mantle, another posture also observed in some
other deep-sea cephalopods [21,23,24]. Other postures were
rarely observed (less than 1% on first approach).
We defined body axis as the absolute angle that the anterior–
posterior mantle axis deviated from a tail-up vertical position (08)
(figure 3b). We measured body axis to the nearest 58, and to
avoid foreshortening we only made a measurement when the
ROV camera had a directly lateral view of a squid (figure 3b).
These measurements were always made at the earliest opportu-
nity
after
spotting
a
squid
with
the
ROV
to
minimize
disturbance effects. We performed all orientation statistics in R
v. 3.1.1 using circular [25,26].

 (d) Lens filtering
Yellow pigmentation in the large left eye of some individuals was
evident in the ROV footage (figure 2c; electronic supplementary
material, video S1), so we classified each lens of each eye as pigmen-
ted or unpigmented. Additionally, we captured three H. heteropsis
and one S. dofleini after filming with the ROV and brought them
aboard the ship, where we confirmed our classifications of lens pig-
mentation in all specimens by direct observation and via lens
transmittance measurements. We measured the spectral transmit-
tance of each large and small lens based on published methods
[27]. An OceanOptics LS-1 light source was mounted directly
abovethelens andcollimatedto makea 4 mm diameterbeam fordif-
fuse lighting. Freshly dissectedlenses were placedon a Gershun tube
mounted to an OceanOptics USB2000 spectrometer and relative
transmittance through the lens was measured from 350 to 800 nm
using SpectraSuite software. We defined the cut-off wavelength
for filtering as T0.5, the wavelength at which the transmittance was
halfway between the maximum and minimum transmittance.
(e) Depth
We extracted the depths recorded at first sight of each indivi-
dual using CTD data from the ROVs (figure 4). We assigned
depth observations to 50 m bins and then adjusted counts for
differences in total ROV sampling time across each depth bin.
(f) Visual modelling
We modelled the change in sighting distance as a function of eye
size and viewer orientation for point-source bioluminescence
(emittance of 1010 photons s21) and a 1 cm wide black object
(a realistic prey size) using a published computational model of
mesopelagic vision [28]. This model takes a statistical approach
to visual detection, in which an eye must reliably distinguish the
number of photons from the target versus the number of photons
from the background. The model also assumes optimal spatial
summation so that the ‘pixel’ of the eye is the same width as the
target to give an upper limit on sighting distance. Model par-
ameters for vision included an integration time of 0.16 s, lens
ratio of 2.55, retinal quantum efficiency of 0.36, dark noise of
2.80 � 1025 s21 and rhabdom diameter of 4 mm [28]. We modelled
the light field from maximum surface irradiance (midday sun) and
selected three depths (300, 400 and 500 m) within the histioteuthid
depth range that demonstrated changes in visual performance
with light attenuation [28]. We also assumed clear oceanic water
(Jerlov Type 1) [5]. Our model is, therefore, a best-case scenario

 for visual detection given optical parameters, and the values for
sighting ranges are probably significant overestimates. However,
the important relationships between sighting distances, pupil
size, depth, viewer orientation and visual target type, which are
the main focus of our analyses, are robust.
3. Results
(a) Eye orientations
In both species studied, the large left eye had an upward
orientation and the smaller eye a slightly downward orien-
tation (figure 3a). Adult H. heteropsis oriented the large left
eye between horizontal and upward at 45 +148 (mean+
s.d.), and orientations were not uniformly distributed in
space (Rao spacing test, n ¼ 29, U ¼ 298, p , 0.001). The
small right eye was oriented between horizontal and down-
ward at 123+ 138 and orientations were not uniformly
distributed in space (Rao spacing test, n ¼ 23, U ¼ 294, p ,
0.001). While most juveniles were in J-pose with their arms
covering their eyes, those that could be measured oriented
their left eye upward at 48 +38 (n ¼ 3) and their right eye
slightly downward at 125 +78 (n ¼ 2). Stigmatoteuthis dofleini
exhibited similar eye orientations, with the left eye upward
at 35+ 128 and not uniformly distributed (Rao spacing test,
n ¼ 5, U ¼ 258, p , 0.001) and the right eye slightly downward
at 1228+48 and not uniformly distributed (Rao spacing test,
n ¼ 5, U ¼ 278, p , 0.001). Mean eye orientations for adult
H. heteropsis, juvenile H. heteropsis and S. dofleini (figure 3a)
were not significantly different for the large left eye (Watson–
Williams test, F ¼ 1.43, d.f.1 ¼ 2, d.f.2 ¼ 34, p ¼ 0.2553) or the
small right eye (Watson–Williams test, F ¼ 0.068, d.f.1 ¼ 2,
d.f.2 ¼ 27, p ¼ 0.89).
A published cross section through both eyes of S. dofleini
shows that the large, semi-tubular left eye has an approximately
908 field of view, while the small, hemispherical right eye has a
larger field of view of approximately 1558 (figure 3c) [8]. With
the visual axis oriented at 458, the large eye receives light
from the area directly above (08) to horizontal (908) on the left
side. With the visual axis oriented at 1208, the small eye receives
light from 438 to 1988 and fully views light coming from both
below and horizontally on the right side (figure 3c).
When an individual was measured multiple times its eye
orientation angles tended to be consistent, and eye move-
ments relative to the head were not observed over short
timescales throughout the video observations. We, however,
observed one specimen each of H. heteropsis and S. dofleini
trapped upside down (head up) in ROV collection containers,
and the large eye in each was rotated anteriorly, demonstrat-
ing that movement is possible (electronic supplementary
material, figure S1). We did not observe any indication of
eye movement in the small eye of any individual. Adults of
both species commonly engaged in a turning behaviour
seen once previously and termed ‘ratcheting,’ in which the
mantle turned relative to the head and then the head snapped
around to rejoin it (figure 2b; electronic supplementary

 material, videos S2 and S3) [29]. Eye orientations were
maintained relative to the surface during these turns.
(b) Posture and body orientation
All histioteuthids observed (n ¼ 161) oriented the head and
arms downward with the posterior mantle upward in a ver-
tical or oblique position throughout all observations. Squid
were primarily found in a J-pose or Straight Arms posture
(figure 3), and if they changed posture during an observation
period they alternated between these two poses. Histioteuthis
heteropsis adult body axes were oblique to vertical at 20 +148
(n ¼ 76), while juveniles had more vertical body axes at 5+
68 (n ¼ 21) (figure 3b). Stigmatoteuthis dofleini had oblique to
vertical body axes at 16+ 98 (n ¼ 8). The mean body axis of
H. heteropsis encountered in the J-pose posture (18 + 148,
n ¼ 56) was significantly more vertical (Watson–Williams
test, F ¼ 11.2, d.f.1 ¼ 1, d.f.2 ¼ 71, p ¼ 0.001) than that of
squid encountered in the straight-arm posture (29+ 108,
n ¼ 17) (figure 3b).
(c) Lens filtering
The lens from the larger left eye varied in pigmentation between
individuals. From video analysis, the left lenses in all juvenile
H. heteropsis (n ¼ 18) were unpigmented, while the left lenses
in 35% of adults were unpigmented (n ¼ 24) but were yellow-
pigmented in the remainder (n ¼ 45) (figure 2c). All S. dofleini
observed (n ¼ 7) were adults with pigmented left lenses. We
measured lens transmittance in both eyes of three H. heteropsis
with unpigmented left lenses and one S. dofleini with a pigmen-
ted left lens. The H. heteropsis lensesthat appeared unpigmented

 also showed no evidence of spectral filtering, while the yellow-
pigmented lens of S. dofleini acted as a cut-off filter with 50%
transmittance at 465 nm. As in a previous report [12], the trans-
mittance spectrum of a lens was unaffected by freezing and
thawing. The small right lens appeared unpigmented across
all specimens of both species and showed no evidence of
spectral filtering.
(d) Depth
Juvenile H. heteropsis occurred at depths of 173 to 487 m
(mean ¼ 390 m, s.d. ¼ 72, n ¼ 22) (figure 4a), while adults
were found significantly deeper (Welch Two Sample t-test,
t ¼ 24.40, d.f. ¼ 44.8, p , 0.0001) from 200 to 766 m (mean ¼
472 m, s.d. ¼ 109, n ¼ 102) (figure 4b). Some H. heteropsis indi-
viduals (n ¼ 20) were not filmed closely enough to be
identified to life stage (figure 4b). Histioteuthis heteropsis depth
reports are primarily daytime sightings (07.00 to 19.00 PST),
but four individuals were seen at other times (mean ¼ 542 m,
s.d. ¼ 109). Adult S. dofleini occurred from 325 to 521 m
(mean ¼ 405, s.d. ¼ 78.4, n ¼ 9). Histioteuthis heteropsis with
yellow-pigmented (n ¼ 42) versus unpigmented (n ¼ 42) left
lenses had significantly different mean depths (Welch Two
Sample t-test, n ¼ 84, t ¼ 22.60, d.f. ¼ 77.1, p ¼ 0.011), but
this did not hold when juveniles were excluded from analysis
(Welch Two Sample t-test, t ¼ 21.00, d.f. ¼ 34.9, p ¼ 0.323).
(e) Visual modelling
Visual modelling demonstrated that while a larger eye
performs better at detecting both a black object and a point-
source of bioluminescence in any given orientation, the gains
in sighting distances with increased pupil diameter are most
pronounced for an eye oriented directly upward and viewing
a black target illuminated by downwelling sunlight (figure 5).
Viewing a black target gets dramatically more difficult with
depth, approximately a 10-fold decrease in sighting distance
for every 100 m increase in depth. Conversely, viewing point
sources becomes slightly easier with depth in the depth range
modelled, as the background light decreases.
A captured specimen of S. dofleini with a 65 mm mantle
length had an 11 mm diameter yellow lens in the large eye
and a 6 mm diameter unpigmented lens in the small eye.
Both a small (e.g. 6 mm aperture), horizontal- or downward-
oriented and a large (e.g. 11 mm aperture), upward-oriented
histioteuthid eye perform well at viewing a bioluminescent
point source. However, the smaller, horizontal- or down-
ward-oriented eye performs very poorly at viewing a black
target, partially because of its reduced aperture but primarily
due to its viewing angle, and thus much darker background
radiance. For example, at a depth of 300 m, for a downward-
looking eye to see a black object at the same distance as a
1.5 mm diameter pupil that was looking up, it would need
a pupil diameter of 40 mm.
4. Discussion
Our in situ observations of eye orientation, body posture
and behaviour in H. heteropsis and S. dofleini provide evidence
that the enlarged left eye looks upward and the smaller
right eye slightly downward (figure 3a,c) [8]. The behavioural
consistency of observed eye orientations across two species
leads us to conclude that the dimorphic eyes of histioteuthids
are a response to the highly directional light field of the
mesopelagic zone [8], rather than an adaptation to differing
brightness in shallow versus deeper water [9,13,30]. It should
be noted that some mesopelagic fish have addressed the
same challenge by developing ‘secondary eyes’ or ‘accessory
eyes’ for looking downward, derived from their principal,
upward-looking eyes [31–33]. Histioteuthid body orienta-
tions, depth distributions, dimorphic lens pigmentation and
visual modelling support the conclusion that the larger left
histioteuthid eye is adapted for upward-viewing.
However, the large left eye did not orient directly
upward, but at a mean angle of 458 in adult H. heteropsis
and 508 in S. dofleini (figure 3a). The small eye oriented
slightly downward, around 1208, in both species. Despite a
clear ability to move the left eye (electronic supplementary

 material, figure S1) here and in previous records [8], we did not
observe any eye movement in free-swimming squid and saw
consistent eye orientations across two histioteuthid species
(figure 3a). Additionally, we observed a common turning be-
haviour unique to histioteuthid squids that maintains eye
orientations on a vertical axis during turns. In this turning be-
haviour, seen once previously in a histioteuthid and termed
‘ratcheting’ [29], the mantle turns relative to the head and
then the head snaps around to rejoin the mantle (figure 2b; elec-
tronic supplementary material, videos S2 and S3). Squid
appeared to have fine muscular control over the extent of the
turn and the precise stopping point. This may allow histio-
teuthids to compensate for the unbalanced fields of view
created by dimorphic eyes (figure 3c) and rapidly change
which direction each eye is facing, or to scan their environment
during a slower turn while keeping the larger eye oriented
upward and the smaller eye slightly down.
There is a risk, as with any ROV behavioural study, that
the presence of the vehicle altered the natural behaviour of
the animals [18], and it is possible that eyes were directed
horizontally towards the ROV more than they would be in
undisturbed squid. However, these squid may maintain a
horizontal component to vision in their large eye in order
to balance their fields of view around the body. Histological
evidence supports this, as rhabdom length, retinal thick-
ness and receptor packing vary across the retinas of both
eyes and may be regionally specialized towards the horizon-
tal and vertical axes of the fields of view [8,11]. The field of
view for the large left eye included the region directly over-
head to horizontal (figure 3c). The semi-tubular shape of

 the eye should increase sensitivity but also restricts the field
of view to about 908, a beneficial trade-off for an eye that
primarily views dim, downwelling sunlight [8]. The smaller
right eye has a broad field of view similar to that of a
human eye, and encompassed an area from directly below
to well-above horizontal. This orientation would work well
for an eye monitoring a large volume of dark water for
bioluminescent flashes [8].
Eye orientations were produced via two characteristic
body postures found in both histioteuthids, and indivi-
duals frequently moved between the two postures during
an observation. In the position we termed ‘Straight Arms’
(figure 1a,d), the mantle was generally oriented at an oblique
angle with the head down, as predicted [8]. This orients the
angled ventral photophores downward so that they may be
used for counterillumination camouflage [8,34]. The other
posture was ‘J-pose’, in which the arms are wrapped dorsally
towards the head and mantle (figure 2a). This pose is
common among cephalopods and may be a defensive pose
[18,35]; we noted H. heteropsis in this posture in the presence
of potential predators (e.g. Dosidicus gigas) and after physical
contact with the ROV. In J-pose the mantle orientations were
closer to vertical (figure 3b), where counterillumination
would not be as effective. Thus, the high incidence of
J-pose in our observations may be a result of disturbance
by the ROV, and Straight Arms may be a more undisturbed
posture in these squids.
We saw variation in lens pigmentation in the large left eye
of H. heteropsis, with more than half of adults displaying
yellow pigmentation in the lens (figure 2c). This probably
occurs with age and development, as juveniles did not
show evidence of lens pigmentation. Additionally, we saw
yellow pigment in the large left lenses of adult S. dofleini,
while no lens pigmentation is reported in small specimens
[12]. Previous records of lens pigmentation in histioteuthids
are variable across species and are based on few specimens,
but the large lens is consistently more heavily pigmented
than the small lens and the pigment is most concentrated in
the outer layers of the large lens [9,11,12].
Yellow lenses are common in upward-looking deep-sea fish
and are thought to help break counterillumination camouflage
by enhancing spectral differences between downwelling sun-
light and bioluminescent camouflage [12,36]. We found that
the pigmented left lens in S. dofleini acted as a high-pass cut-
off filter with 50% transmittance at approximately 465 nm,
close to the dominant wavelength of downwelling sunlight
and similar to pigment absorbance previously reported via
different methods [12]. Thus, the development of yellow filters
in the upward-facing large histioteuthid lens may coincide
with a shift in diet towards counterilluminating prey. Indeed,
adult histioteuthids are known to eat counterilluminating
organisms such as shrimp, myctophid lanternfishes, and
other cephalopods, while juveniles primarily eat copepods
and euphausiids [7,15,37,38].
Our ROV sampling of H. heteropsis depth distributions in
the Monterey Canyon closely matched daytime depths
previously reported through trawling off southern California
[14]. Histioteuthids were rarely seen deeper than 800 m,
which approaches the lower limit for the detection of down-
welling sunlight [39]. We found additional evidence of
ontogenetic descent in H. heteropsis, with juveniles occupying
shallower depths than adults (figure 4). This is consistent
with patterns seen in other histioteuthid species [8,37]
and indicates that the dimorphic enlargement of the left
histioteuthid eye that occurs throughout development is con-
current with a descent into deeper, dimmer waters of the
mesopelagic region.
Visual modelling indicated that the observed orienta-
tions of the large and small eyes of histioteuthids were
probably important to the evolution of the size dimorphism.
When looking at extended scenes, it is nearly impossible to
recover the sighting range that is lost going from an
upward- to a downward-oriented eye of any size (figure 5).
However, sighting ranges for point-source bioluminescence
do not change as substantially with viewing angle. Thus,
for an upward-oriented eye viewing a black object, small
increases in lens diameter (aperture) produce large gains in
sighting distances. However, for a downward-oriented eye
viewing a black object, even large increases in lens diameter
do little to improve sighting distances. Eyes are metabolically
expensive to grow, maintain, and use, so while larger
eyes can improve both sensitivity and resolution, selection
probably favours an eye just large enough to perform a neces-
sary visual task but no larger [40]. Thus, once each eye has
been consistently designated as upward-viewing or horizon-
tal- to downward-viewing through behaviour, it is not
difficult to imagine how selection could have favoured
increasingly dimorphic specializations in each eye of the
‘cockeyed’ squids.
