Abstract
Background
The potential endocrine-disrupting effects of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been
demonstrated in animal studies, but whether PFASs may interfere with body weight regula-
tion in humans is largely unknown. This study aimed to examine the associations of PFAS
exposure with changes in body weight and resting metabolic rate (RMR) in a diet-induced
weight-loss setting.
Methods and findings
In the 2-year POUNDS Lost randomized clinical trial based in Boston, Massachusetts, and
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, that examined the effects of energy-restricted diets on weight
changes, baseline plasma concentrations of major PFASs were measured among 621 over-
weight and obese participants aged 30–70 years. Body weight was measured at baseline
and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. RMR and other metabolic parameters, including glucose, lip-
ids, thyroid hormones, and leptin, were measured at baseline and 6 and 24 months. Partici-
pants lost an average of 6.4 kg of body weight during the first 6 months (weight-loss period)
and subsequently regained an average of 2.7 kg of body weight during the period of 6–24
months (weight regain period). After multivariate adjustment, baseline PFAS concentrations
were not significantly associated with concurrent body weight or weight loss during the first
6 months. In contrast, higher baseline levels of PFASs were significantly associated with a
greater weight regain, primarily in women. In women, comparing the highest to the lowest

 tertiles of PFAS concentrations, the multivariate-adjusted mean weight regain (SE) was 4.0
(0.8) versus 2.1 (0.9) kg for perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (Ptrend = 0.01); 4.3 (0.9)
versus 2.2 (0.8) kg for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (Ptrend = 0.007); 4.7 (0.9) versus 2.5
(0.9) kg for perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) (Ptrend = 0.006); 4.9 (0.9) versus 2.7 (0.8) kg for
perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) (Ptrend = 0.009); and 4.2 (0.8) versus 2.5 (0.9) kg for
perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) (Ptrend = 0.03). When further adjusted for changes in body
weight or thyroid hormones during the first 6 months, results remained similar. Moreover,
higher baseline plasma PFAS concentrations, especially for PFOS and PFNA, were signifi-
cantly associated with greater decline in RMR during the weight-loss period and less
increase in RMR during the weight regain period in both men and women. Limitations of the
study include the possibility of unmeasured or residual confounding by socioeconomic and
psychosocial factors, as well as possible relapse to the usual diet prior to randomization,
which could have been rich in foods contaminated by PFASs through food packaging and
also dense in energy.
Conclusions
In this diet-induced weight-loss trial, higher baseline plasma PFAS concentrations were
associated with a greater weight regain, especially in women, possibly explained by a slower
regression of RMR levels. These data illustrate a potential novel pathway through which
PFASs interfere with human body weight regulation and metabolism. The possible impact of
environmental chemicals on the obesity epidemic therefore deserves attention.

 other metabolic parameters during weight loss and weight regain over the 2 years the
participants were on the study diet.
• Higher baseline levels of PFASs were significantly associated with a greater weight
regain, primarily in women. On average, women in the highest tertile of PFAS concen-
trations regained 1.7–2.2 kg more body weight than women in the lowest tertile.
• Higher baseline plasma concentrations of PFASs, especially perfluorooctanesulfonic
acid (PFOS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), were significantly associated with
greater decline in RMR during the first 6 months and less increase in RMR during the
period when participants on average regained weight (6–24 months).
What do these findings mean?
• In this diet-induced weight-loss trial, higher baseline PFAS concentrations were associ-
ated with a greater weight regain, especially in women, possibly explained by a slower
return of RMR levels. These data provide initial evidence suggesting that PFASs may
interfere with human body weight regulation and counteract efforts to maintain weight
loss in adults.
Introduction
Obesity has become a worldwide public health concern [1,2]. Based on recent US data, the
prevalence of obesity is 37.7% in adults and 17.0% in children and adolescents, with no sign of
a reduction in the foreseeable future [3–5]. Although many approaches can be used to achieve
short-term weight loss, its maintenance remains a key challenge [6,7]. Meanwhile, given the
same intervention strategies, apparent within-group variability in weight loss and weight
regain has been demonstrated [7,8]. Although the exact reasons for the variability are largely
unknown, accumulating evidence has suggested that certain environmental compounds may
play an important role in weight gain and obesity development [9,10].
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), especially perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluor-
ooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), have been identified as plausible endocrine disruptors with the
potential to perturb weight regulation [9,11–14]. Evidence from animal studies has suggested
that PFASs may be involved in altering energy metabolism and thyroid hormone homeostasis
[15–17], likely through the activation of various transcriptional factors, such as the peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) [18–20]. However, given the species-specific toxico-
kinetics and tissue distribution of PFASs [18], extrapolation from animals to humans has yet
to be supported. Although some human studies have examined the potential intergenerational
effects of PFASs on body weight, the findings were somewhat inconsistent [21–27]. To our
knowledge, no prospective study has explored the association between PFAS exposure and
weight change in adults under controlled circumstances. Furthermore, it is largely unknown
whether resting metabolic rate (RMR) or thyroid hormones, factors that can influence energy
expenditure [28], might be also involved in the potential effects of PFASs on weight regulation
[29,30].
PFASs are extensively used in many industrial and consumer products, including food
packaging, paper and textile coatings, and non-stick cookware [31–34]. A recent study

 reported that the drinking water supplies for at least 6 million US citizens may exceed the US
Environmental Protection Agency’s health advisory limit for lifetime exposure to PFOS and
PFOA from drinking water [35]. In addition, these compounds are extremely stable in the
environment and have a long elimination half-life in the human body [36], thus rendering
PFASs a possible threat to human health. Due to the potential metabolic abnormalities associ-
ated with elevated PFAS levels, we aimed to examine the associations of PFAS exposure with
changes in body weight and RMR in the well-designed and rigorously conducted POUNDS
(Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies) Lost trial [37].
Methods
Ethics statement
The protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at the Harvard T.H. Chan School
of Public Health, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and the Pennington Biomedical Research
Center of the Louisiana State University System, as well as by a data and safety monitoring
board appointed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. All participants provided
written informed consent. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00072995).
Study participants
The POUNDS Lost study, a 2-year randomized clinical trial, was designed to compare the
effects of 4 energy-reduced diets with different macronutrient (i.e., fat, protein, and carbohy-
drate) compositions on body weight, as previously described [37]. At baseline, 811 overweight
and obese men and women aged 30–70 years were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 diets that con-
sisted of different compositions of similar foods and met the guidelines for cardiovascular
health. Eighty percent of the participants (n = 645) completed the trial. Each participant’s calo-
ric prescription for the 2-year period represented a deficit of 750 kcal per day from baseline, as
calculated from each individual’s resting energy expenditure and activity level [37]. All partici-
pants had normal thyroid function at study baseline [38]. The main findings of this trial were
that most of the weight loss was observed in the first 6 months, followed by a gradual weight
regain through to 24 months, and that the weight changes (both weight loss and weight regain)
did not differ significantly between the diet groups [37].
The current analysis included 621 participants with available fasting plasma samples col-
lected at baseline. Of these individuals, 592 and 460 participants also provided blood samples
at 6 months and 2 years, respectively.
Measurements of anthropometry and RMR
In the morning before breakfast and after urination, body weight and waist circumference
were measured at baseline and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Body mass index (BMI) was calcu-
lated as body weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. At baseline and 6 and
24 months, body fat mass and lean mass (n = 424) were measured using dual energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic QDR 4500A bone densitometer; Hologic); visceral and sub-
cutaneous abdominal fat (n = 165) were measured using a computed tomography (CT) scan-
ner [39]; and blood pressure was measured by an automated device (Omron HEM907XL;
Omron). RMR was assessed at baseline and 6 and 24 months using a Deltatrac II Metabolic
Monitor (Datex-Ohmeda) after an overnight fast [40]. Briefly, after a 30-minute rest, a trans-
parent plastic hood was placed over the head of the participant for another 30 minutes. Partici-
pants were required to keep still and awake during the test, and the last 20 minutes of
measurements were used for the calculation of RMR [40].

 Laboratory measurements of PFASs and other metabolic markers
Plasma concentrations of PFOS, PFOA, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexanesul-
fonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) were measured at baseline only, using
a sensitive and reliable method based on online solid phase extraction and liquid chromatogra-
phy coupled to a triple quadropole mass spectrometer [41], with minor modifications. Due to
the long elimination half-lives of the PFASs and incomplete samplings, we did not measure
plasma PFAS levels during the trial. For all major PFASs, the concentrations were above the
limit of detection (0.05 ng/ml), and the inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation were
<6.3% and <6.1%, respectively.
In our pilot study evaluating the within-person stability of PFAS concentrations, intra-class
correlation coefficients (ICCs) between concentrations in 2 blood samples collected 1–2 years
apart from 58 participants in the Nurses’ Health Study II demonstrated excellent reproducibil-
ity of PFAS concentrations in blood: the ICCs were 0.91 for PFOS, 0.90 for PFOA, 0.94 for
PFHxS, 0.87 for PFNA, and 0.82 for PFDA (all P < 0.001).
At baseline, 6 months, and 24 months, fasting plasma glucose, insulin, total cholesterol,
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and
triglycerides were measured on the Synchron CX7 (Beckman Coulter), and hemoglobin A1C
(HbA1c) was measured on a Synchron CX5 (Beckman Coulter); plasma leptin and soluble lep-
tin receptor were measured by an ultrasensitive immunoassay (R&D Systems); and serum free
triiodothyronine (T3), free thyroxine (T4), total T3, total T4, and thyroid stimulating hormone
were measured using a competitive electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on the Roche E
modular system (Roche Diagnostics), as previously described elsewhere [37]. The homeostatic
model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) value was calculated using the updated
HOMA model (HOMA2) described by Levy et al. [42]. Adipose tissue was obtained from 103
participants at baseline and at 6 months. Gene expression was measured by direct hybridiza-
tion using the Illumina HumanHT-12 v3 Expression BeadChip (Illumina) (details in S1 Text).
Assessments of other covariates
Using standardized questionnaires, we obtained information on age, sex, race (white, black,
Hispanic, or other), educational attainment (high school or less, some college, or college grad-
uate or beyond), smoking status (never, former, or current smoker), alcohol consumption
(drinks/week), menopausal status (yes or no), and hormone replacement therapy use (yes or
no). At baseline, 6 months, and 24 months, physical activity was assessed using the Baecke
physical activity questionnaire, which included 16 items inquiring about levels of habitual
physical activities (i.e., physical activity at work, sports during leisure time, and other physical
activity during leisure time) [43]. All responses were pre-coded on 5-point scales. Total physi-
cal activity was expressed as the average of the sum of the individual responses, with a score
ranging from 0 to 5 [43].
Statistical analysis
The comparisons between participants included in the current analysis and those excluded
were evaluated by the Student’s t test for normally distributed variables, the Wilcoxon rank-
sum test for skewed variables, and the chi-squared test for categorical variables. The associa-
tions between baseline PFASs and changes in body weight and RMR during the period of
weight loss (first 6 months) or weight regain (6–24 months) were examined using linear
regression. The least-square means of changes in body weight (at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months)
and RMR (at 6 and 24 months) according to tertiles of baseline PFAS concentrations were cal-
culated. In addition, the relationship between PFASs and other potential mediators including

 thyroid hormones and leptin were further evaluated using linear regression. Covariates con-
sidered in multivariate adjustments included baseline age (continuous), sex, race, educational
attainment (high school or less, some college, or college graduate or beyond), smoking status
(never, former, or current smoker), alcohol consumption (continuous), physical activity (con-
tinuous), the 4 diet groups, and baseline BMI (or baseline RMR for the analysis of RMR
change). Moreover, menopausal status and hormone replacement therapy (women only) were
also entered into the model in a sensitivity analysis. To test the linear trend of the associations
of baseline PFAS concentrations with changes in body weight and RMR, we assigned a median
value to each tertile of PFAS concentration and treated it as a continuous variable. We also
tested the linear trend using the PFAS concentrations as continuous variables (log10-trans-
formed). In an exploratory analysis, factor analysis was used to explore the potential exposure
patterns of PFASs.
To investigate the associations of baseline PFASs with baseline values of and changes in
other metabolic parameters (including glucose, lipids, thyroid hormones, and leptin), Spear-
man correlation coefficients (rs) were calculated with adjustment for the potential confounders
mentioned above. Stratified analysis was also conducted according to sex, and a likelihood
ratio test was performed to test for potential interactions. In sensitivity analyses, body weight
or RMR at 6 months (or changes during the first 6 months), instead of the baseline value, was
included in the multivariate models when examining the associations between baseline PFASs
and changes in body weight or RMR during the period of 6–24 months. We also stratified the
analyses by dietary intervention group. In addition, to account for the correlations between
measurements on the same individuals, linear mixed-effects models were also used to examine
the associations between baseline PFAS concentrations and weight regain (weight measure-
ments at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months), with an unstructured covariance matrix. To assess con-
founding patterns, in another sensitivity analysis, the covariates were entered into the model
in a stepwise manner. In an exploratory analysis, we also examined the associations of PFAS
exposures with the gene expression profile in adipose tissue (S1 Text).
A 2-sided P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical analyses were per-
formed with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
Study population
The mean (SD) age of the 621 participants was 51.4 (9.1) years, with a mean (SD) baseline BMI
of 32.6 (3.8) kg/m2. Participants lost an average of 6.4 kg of body weight during the first 6
months and subsequently regained an average of 2.7 kg during the remaining study period. In
comparison with the POUNDS Lost participants not included in the current study due to the
lack of plasma samples at baseline, the participants included were slightly older (51.4 versus
49.1 years, P = 0.01), but there were no significant differences in other characteristics, includ-
ing body weight and RMR (S1 Table).
Associations between PFASs, body weight, and other metabolic parameters
at baseline
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the study participants. PFOS and PFOA were the
dominant PFASs. The median (interquartile range) plasma concentration was 24.5 (16.2–37.0)
ng/ml for PFOS, 4.5 (3.3–6.3) ng/ml for PFOA, 2.4 (1.5–3.6) ng/ml for PFHxS, 1.5 (1.0–2.4)
ng/ml for PFNA, and 0.37 (0.27–0.52) ng/ml for PFDA. At baseline, significant inter-correla-
tions were observed between PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFDA (rs ranged from 0.38 to

analysis. After multivariate adjustment, PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA concentration were all posi-
tively associated with insulin, HOMA-IR, diastolic blood pressure, and free T3 (rs ranged from
0.10 to 0.18, all P < 0.05) at baseline. In addition, certain PFASs (e.g., PFHxS and PFDA) were
positively associated with some of the variables, including visceral fat mass, systolic blood pres-
sure, glucose, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, free T4, total T4, and leptin (rs ranged from 0.08

ence, BMI, or RMR at baseline.
Baseline PFASs and body weight changes
After multivariate adjustment including smoking status, physical activity, baseline BMI, and
dietary intervention group, baseline PFAS concentrations were not associated with weight loss
in the first 6 months (Table 2). The crude positive associations between certain PFAS levels
and weight loss were abolished after multivariate adjustment (Table 2). In contrast, after multi-
variate adjustment, baseline PFOS and PFNA concentrations were positively associated with
greater weight regain in the total study population. Comparing the highest to the lowest ter-
tiles, the least-square means (SEs) of weight regain were 3.3 (0.6) versus 1.8 (0.6) kg for PFOS
(Ptrend = 0.009) and 3.4 (0.6) versus 2.0 (0.6) kg for PFNA (Ptrend = 0.01) (Model 2 in Table 2).
The results were similar when PFAS concentrations were treated as continuous variables (the
beta coefficients for per-unit log10-transformed PFOS and PFNA increment were 0.80 and
1.02, respectively; both Pcontinuous < 0.05) (Table 2). After further adjusting for baseline thyroid
hormones (Model 3 in Table 2), the associations remained significant. In sensitivity analyses,
when body weight at baseline or 6 months (instead of BMI at baseline) was adjusted for in the
models, the results were largely unchanged. When changes in body weight or changes in thy-
roid hormones or leptin during the first 6 months were also included as covariates, the results
did not change materially. In addition, similar results were obtained when using linear mixed-
effects models. When PFAS levels were categorized into quartiles, the results were largely
similar.
Sex-specific associations between PFASs and weight regain
In an analysis stratified by sex, significant associations with weight regain were observed for all
individual PFASs in women, but not in men. Comparing the highest to the lowest tertiles, the
least-square means (SEs) of weight regain in women were 4.0 (0.8) versus 2.1 (0.9) kg for
PFOS (Ptrend = 0.01); 4.3 (0.9) versus 2.2 (0.8) kg for PFOA (Ptrend = 0.007); 4.9 (0.9) versus 2.7
(0.8) kg for PFHxS (Ptrend = 0.009); 4.7 (0.9) versus 2.5 (0.9) kg for PFNA (Ptrend = 0.006); and
4.2 (0.8) versus 2.5 (0.9) kg for PFDA (Ptrend = 0.03) (Table 3). Significant interactions with sex
were demonstrated for PFOA and PFHxS (Pinteraction = 0.04 and 0.01, respectively). When the
covariates were entered into the model in a stepwise manner, these results did not change
materially (S3 Table). The trajectory of changes in body weight in men and women according
to tertiles of PFAS concentrations is shown in Fig 1. The trajectory of changes in body weight
among total participants is shown in S1 Fig.
Baseline PFASs and changes in RMR
After multivariate adjustment, including baseline RMR and dietary intervention group, base-
line plasma PFAS concentrations, especially for PFOS and PFNA, were significantly associated
with a greater decline in RMR during the weight-loss period (first 6 months) and a lower
increase in RMR during the weight regain period (6–24 months). During the first 6 months,
comparing the highest to the lowest tertiles, the least-square means (SEs) of RMR change were
−45.4 (15.5) versus −5.0 (16.3) kcal/day for PFOS (Ptrend = 0.005) and −49.8 (15.9) versus −3.3
(16.1) kcal/day for PFNA (Ptrend = 0.002) (Model 3 in Table 4). During the period of 6–24
months, comparing the highest to the lowest tertiles, the least-square means (SEs) of RMR
change were 0.9 (26.2) versus 94.6 (27.5) kcal/day for PFOS (Ptrend < 0.001); 12.7 (28.1) versus
69.3 (27.3) kcal/day for PFOA (Ptrend = 0.03); 24.6 (28.5) versus 81.5 (27.5) kcal/day for PFHxS
(Ptrend = 0.03); 14.1 (27.7) versus 73.7 (27.6) kcal/day for PFNA (Ptrend = 0.02); and 23.1 (27.6)

 further adjusted for, the results remained largely unchanged. In the sex-stratified analysis, sim-
ilar results were observed, although some associations did not reach statistical significance,
possibly due to diminished power (S4 Table). No interaction between PFASs and sex on RMR
changes was detected. The trajectory of changes in RMR among total participants according to
tertiles of PFAS concentrations is shown in Fig 2. In addition, similar results were demon-
strated when analyses were stratified by dietary intervention group.
Baseline PFASs and changes in other metabolic parameters
During the weight-loss period, after multivariate adjustment including baseline levels of each
metabolic parameter, plasma concentrations of PFOS, PFNA, and PFDA were inversely associ-
ated with changes in visceral fat mass (rs ranged from −0.19 to −0.27, all P < 0.05), and base-
line PFOA was inversely associated with changes in HDL cholesterol (rs = −0.12, P < 0.01) (S5
Table). During the weight regain period, baseline PFOS, PFNA, and PFDA levels were posi-
tively associated with changes in some of the parameters, including waist circumference,

were associated with a greater increase in visceral fat mass (rs = 0.30 and 0.27, respectively;
both P < 0.05) (S5 Table). The results were largely similar when analyses were stratified by sex.
In sensitivity analyses, the results did not materially change when further adjusting for study
location (Boston or Baton Rouge) or participant compliance (number of sessions participants
attended). The table in S1 Text shows the associations of baseline PFASs with gene expression
in adipose tissue.
Discussion
In this 2-year randomized weight-loss trial, we found that higher baseline plasma PFAS con-
centrations were not associated with weight loss induced by energy restriction, but were signif-
icantly associated with a greater weight regain, primarily among women, during the follow-up
period between 6 and 24 months. In addition, after multivariate adjustment, higher baseline
PFAS levels were significantly associated with a greater decrease in RMR during the weight-
loss period and a lower increase in RMR during the weight regain period.
Comparison with other studies
To date, evidence on the influence of PFAS exposure on body weight change and metabolic
parameters has been limited and has been primarily generated from cross-sectional studies
that could not establish causal relationships [30,44–47]. In addition, the causes of weight
change are likely heterogeneous (including diet, physical activity, and medications) and often
not well understood in observational studies. Prospective evidence linking PFAS exposure
with body weight regulation was primarily from studies that examined prenatal or early life
exposures to PFASs in relation to body weight later in life, and the results were somewhat
mixed [21–27,48,49]. For example, in 3 birth cohort studies conducted in European popula-
tions, maternal concentrations of PFASs were significantly associated with offspring body
weight and other anthropometric and metabolic traits, primarily among girls [21,23,25]. How-
ever, other studies generated inconsistent findings regarding maternal PFAS exposure and off-
spring BMI or obesity risk, with no sex difference [22,24,49]. In addition, recently, in the
European Youth Heart Study, Domazet et al. demonstrated that higher plasma PFOS concen-
trations during childhood, but not adolescence, were associated with greater adiposity in ado-
lescence and young adulthood [48].
To our knowledge, the current investigation is among the first studies in adults to evaluate
the associations of PFAS exposures with changes in body weight and metabolic parameters
induced during a controlled weight-loss trial. All individual PFASs were significantly associ-
ated with more weight regain in women, but not in men, which was in agreement with previ-
ous studies in which the intergenerational effects of PFASs on body weight were observed only
in girls and not in boys [21,25,26]. Although the reasons for these gender-specific findings are
still unclear, accumulating evidence from experimental research suggests that PFASs are able
to interfere with estrogen metabolism and functionalities [12,50,51]. As potential endocrine
disruptors, PFASs might reduce estradiol production and the expression of some key genes
related to estrogen synthesis [12], or influence estradiol concentrations through pathways such
as hepatic aromatase induction, with an initial inhibition and a later stimulation [50]. Using in
vitro and in silico species comparison approaches, Benninghoff et al. reported that PFASs may
interact directly with estrogen receptors, suggesting that PFASs could act as weak environmen-
tal xenoestrogens [51]. The experimental evidence implies that the detrimental effects of
PFASs can be sex-specific, thus supporting the notion that women may be particularly vulner-
able to obesogenic effects of PFASs. In addition, it is worth noticing that women generally

 have a higher percentage of body fat than men [52]. Given that fat-free mass could substan-
tially influence RMR, the difference in body composition between men and women could
result in significant differences in energy homeostasis dynamics [52].
In addition to the adverse effects of PFASs on estrogen-related pathways, animal studies
suggest that PFOA and PFOS may also interfere with energy homeostasis and the endocrine
system through other mechanisms [14,15,18,53], including the activation of PPARα and
PPARγ [18,19], key regulators in fatty acid oxidation, differentiation and normal function of
adipocytes, and glucose metabolism [20,54]. An experiment on human liver cells suggested
that PFOA could alter the expression of proteins regulated by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α
[55], which is a key regulator of lipid metabolism and gluconeogenesis [56]. In addition, some
animal studies have suggested that PFAS exposure might disrupt thyroid hormone homeosta-
sis, possibly via influencing uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferases and type 1 deiodinase
[17,57]. Of note, due to the species-specific toxicokinetics (e.g., the elimination half-lives are
3–8 years in humans and 17–30 days in mice and monkeys) and tissue distribution of PFASs
[18], caution is needed when extrapolating findings from animal studies to humans. In addi-
tion, mechanisms need to be elucidated to interpret the findings that higher baseline PFASs,
especially PFOS and PFNA, were associated with changes in RMR, which is a major determi-
nant of weight maintenance, in both men and women [58,59]. Finally, whether the 5 major
PFASs might have different biological mechanisms and perhaps exert additive or synergistic
effects also warrants further exploration.
Strengths and limitations of study
The primary strength of the current study is that the cause of weight changes was well charac-
terized. Unlike previous observational studies in which reasons for weight changes were usu-
ally unknown, this weight-loss trial applied energy restriction to induce the weight changes.
Moreover, repeated measurements of body weight, RMR, thyroid hormones, leptin, and other
metabolic biomarkers allowed documentation of longitudinal associations between PFAS
exposures and changes in these parameters during the weight-loss and weight regain periods.
Several limitations should be considered as well. First, although we included men and
women with a wide range of ages (30–70 years), participants in the current study were other-
wise relatively homogeneous in terms of health status and body fatness because they were
selected following narrow inclusion criteria. Therefore, it is unclear whether our findings can
be extrapolated to more general populations. Second, we measured only the baseline plasma
PFAS concentrations. However, given the long elimination half-lives (3–8 years) of these
chemicals [36] and a strong stability over time observed in our pilot study, concentrations in
the blood likely reflect relatively long-term PFAS exposures. Moreover, unlike many other per-
sistent organic pollutants, PFASs are not lipophilic, and blood concentrations are therefore
not affected by changes in the size of the lipid compartment [60]. Third, we did not measure
ghrelin, an orexigenic hormone regulating appetite, RMR, and other key physiological pro-
cesses related to weight changes [61], and the interrelationship between PFASs and ghrelin
during weight changes needs to be elucidated. Fourth, we did not apply Bonferroni correction
in the analyses given the inter-correlation between the PFASs (rs ranged from 0.4 to 0.9),
and the role of multiple testing could not be entirely excluded. Fifth, physical activity was
assessed using the Baecke questionnaire, which might be subject to measurement errors,
although a validation study conducted in US adults has shown reasonable validity of this ques-
tionnaire [62]. In addition, although some covariates including education, smoking status, and
physical activity were adjusted for in our study, we could not entirely exclude the possibility
that unmeasured or residual confounding by socioeconomic and psychosocial factors, as well

 as participants’ usual diet, might partially account for the associations we observed. One par-
ticular concern is that PFASs are extensively used in food packaging due to their oil- and
water-repellant characteristics [32]. If some participants relapsed to their usual pre-randomi-
zation diet and this diet was rich in foods that are contaminated by PFASs through food pack-
aging and are also dense in energy, they might thus have gained weight faster. However, when
we further controlled for the frequency of craving hamburgers, French fries, or donuts at base-
line assessed using a questionnaire, the results were largely unchanged. In addition, humans
are exposed to PFASs through multiple pathways, including drinking water and contaminated
seafood [31], although these factors are not established risk factors for weight gain. Moreover,
we adjusted for the number of study sessions that participants attended, which is a measure-
ment of compliance to the prescribed diet. Finally, lipophilic persistent pollutants with obeso-
genic effects (such as hexachlorobenzene [HCB] and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene
[DDE]) might have confounded the associations of PFASs with changes in body weight and
RMR. However, in 793 women participating in the Nurses’ Health Study II, weak associations
were observed between PFASs and lipophilic persistent pollutants (e.g., the rs of PFOA and
PFOS with HCB was 0.07 and 0.06, respectively, and the rs of PFOA and PFOS with DDE was
0.05 and 0.06, respectively), suggesting that confounding by these pollutants would not be
substantial.
Implications of findings
Our study provides the first piece of evidence from a controlled weight-loss trial that higher
baseline plasma PFAS concentrations in adults are associated with a greater weight regain,
especially in women, possibly due to suppressed RMR levels. These findings imply that over-
weight and obese individuals with relatively low PFAS exposures might potentially benefit
more from weight-loss interventions. Although the production of PFOS and PFOA in the US
has largely been phased out [31,63], the production of other PFASs, such as PFNA, may con-
tinue or even increase, especially in developing countries [64]. Given the persistence of these
PFASs in the environment and the human body, their potential adverse effects remain a public
health concern.
Conclusions
In a diet-induced weight-loss setting among overweight and obese individuals, higher baseline
plasma PFAS concentrations were significantly associated with greater weight regain, espe-
cially in women, accompanied by a slower regression of RMR. These findings suggest that
environmental chemicals may play a role in the current obesity epidemic. More studies are
warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the link between PFAS exposure and
weight regulation in humans.
