IMPORTANCE Bacteriuria plus pyuria is highly prevalent among older women living in nursing
homes. Cranberry capsules are an understudied, nonantimicrobial prevention strategy used
in this population.
OBJECTIVE To test the effect of 2 oral cranberry capsules once a day on presence of
bacteriuria plus pyuria among women residing in nursing homes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Double-blind,randomized,placebo-controlledefficacy

orolder,withorwithoutbacteriuriapluspyuriaatbaseline,residingin21nursinghomeslocated
within50miles(80km)ofNewHaven,Connecticut(August24,2012-October26,2015).
INTERVENTIONS Two oral cranberry capsules, each capsule containing 36 mg of the active
ingredient proanthocyanidin (ie, 72 mg total, equivalent to 20 ounces of cranberry juice)
vs placebo administered once a day in 92 treatment and 93 control group participants.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Presence of bacteriuria (ie, at least 105 colony-forming units
[CFUs] per milliliter of 1 or 2 microorganisms in urine culture) plus pyuria (ie, any number of
white blood cells on urinalysis) assessed every 2 months over the 1-year study surveillance;
any positive finding was considered to meet the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were
symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), all-cause death, all-cause hospitalization, all
multidrug antibiotic–resistant organisms, antibiotics administered for suspected UTI, and
total antimicrobial administration.
RESULTS Of the 185 randomized study participants (mean age, 86.4 years [SD, 8.2], 90.3%
white, 31.4% with bacteriuria plus pyuria at baseline), 147 completed the study. Overall
adherence was 80.1%. Unadjusted results showed the presence of bacteriuria plus pyuria in
25.5% (95% CI, 18.6%-33.9%) of the treatment group and in 29.5% (95% CI, 22.2%-37.9%) of
the control group. The adjusted generalized estimating equations model that accounted for
missing data and covariates showed no significant difference in the presence of bacteriuria plus
pyuria between the treatment group vs the control group (29.1% vs 29.0%; OR, 1.01; 95% CI,
0.61-1.66; P = .98). There were no significant differences in number of symptomatic UTIs
(10 episodes in the treatment group vs 12 in the control group), rates of death (17 vs 16 deaths;
20.4 vs 19.1 deaths/100 person-years; rate ratio [RR], 1.07; 95% CI, 0.54-2.12), hospitalization
(33 vs 50 admissions; 39.7 vs 59.6 hospitalizations/100 person-years; RR, 0.67; 95% CI,
0.32-1.40), bacteriuria associated with multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli (9 vs 24
episodes; 10.8 vs 28.6 episodes/100 person-years; RR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.10-1.46), antibiotics
administered for suspected UTIs (692 vs 909 antibiotic days; 8.3 vs 10.8 antibiotic
days/person-year; RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.44-1.33), or total antimicrobial utilization (1415 vs 1883
antimicrobial days; 17.0 vs 22.4 antimicrobial days/person-year; RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.46-1.25).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among older women residing in nursing homes,
administration of cranberry capsules vs placebo resulted in no significant difference in
presence of bacteriuria plus pyuria over 1 year.

U
rinary tract infection (UTI) is the most commonly
diagnosed infection among nursing home residents.
Distinguishing symptomatic UTI from asymptom-
atic bacteriuria is problematic among nursing home resi-
dents because of challenges with symptom assessment.1
Bacteriuria is prevalent in 25% to 50% of women living in
nursing homes, and pyuria is present in 90% of those with
bacteriuria.2 A randomized trial of antibiotic treatment vs
no treatment of bacteriuria in nursing home women showed
no decrease in genitourinary morbidity or mortality with
treatment.3 This study along with others4 led to the recom-
mendation that bacteriuria should not be treated with anti-
biotics in older institutionalized adults.3 Bacteriuria plus
pyuria is a necessary but not sufficient condition to make
the diagnosis of UTI in this population.5,6
Cranberry products represent a potential nonantimicro-
bial method for UTI prevention. Cranberry proanthocyani-
dins have been shown to inhibit adherence of P-fimbriated
Escherichia coli to uroepithelial cells,7 and this effect on
virulence is dose dependent.8 Because E coli represents
the majority of urinary isolates among nursing home resi-
dents, cranberry products remain an appealing UTI
prevention strategy, but evidence is conflicting.9,10 Most
published reports have used cranberry juice and pos-
tulated reasons for lack of benefit have included insufficient
participant adherence to cranberry juice consumption and
insufficient proanthocyanidins in the tested cranberry
product.9 Among older women (ie, mean age, 78.5 years),
300 mL (ie, approximately 10 ounces) of cranberry juice
cocktail containing 36 mg of proanthocyanidins reduced
bacteriuria plus pyuria over 6 months.11 However, the acrid
flavor of cranberry juice is difficult to tolerate in large
volumes,12 especially for nursing home residents because of
swallowing disorders, exacerbation of incontinence, and
impaired thirst.13
Prior studies showed that cranberry capsule administra-
tion and urine collection is feasible, and 2 cranberry capsules
(each containing 36 mg proanthocyanidins [total 72 mg pro-
anthocyanidins], equivalent to 20 ounces of cranberry juice)
are an optimal dose to test among women living in nursing
homes.14,15 The primary aim of this trial was to test the effect
of 2 oral cranberry capsules once a day, compared with pla-
cebo, on the presence of bacteriuria plus pyuria among older
women nursing home residents.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
This study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled efficacy trial comparing 2 cranberry capsules vs 2
placebo capsules once per day. The unit of randomization
was each participant. Nursing homes targeted for participa-
tion had at least 90 beds, within a 50-mile (80 km) radius of
New Haven, Connecticut, that had UTI rates and sociode-
mographic characteristics similar to national averages. The
Yale Human Investigation Committee approved the study;
all nursing home administrators signed letters of participa-
tion and signed consent was obtained from participants or
their surrogates.
Participants
Nursing homes were approached sequentially, and all
residents in participating facilities were screened. Once
enrollment was initiated at one nursing home, screening
began at the next home. A Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act waiver (http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa
/for-professionals/privacy) was obtained for recruitment
purposes. Inclusion criteria were (1) female; (2) long-term
care residents; (3) English speaking; and (4) 65 years or older.
Only women were included in this study for the following
reasons: (1) a prior study included women only11; (2) women
are the majority of nursing home residents; (3) there is limited
evidencethatcranberryproductsreducebacteriuriapluspyuria
in men; (4) the predominant risk factor for UTI in men is
underlyingstructuralorfunctionalabnormalitiesoftheurinary
tract; and (5) the prevalence of bacteriuria plus pyuria is lower
in men.
Exclusion criteria were (1) not expected to be in the
nursing home for at least 1 month (ie, short-term rehabilita-
tion, pending discharge, terminal life expectancy <1 month);
(2) taking chronic suppressive antibiotic or anti-infective
(ie, mandelamine) therapy for recurrent UTI; (3) undergoing
dialysis for end-stage renal disease; (4) unable to produce a
baseline clean catch urine specimen; (5) receiving warfarin
therapy, which could cause an interaction with cranberry
juice16; (6) history of nephrolithiasis because cranberry
products may increase the risk of nephrolithiasis17; (7) pres-
ence of an indwelling bladder catheter; (8) allergy to cran-
berry products; (9) treatment with cranberry products; and
(10) nursing home residence for less than 4 weeks. Women
with and without bacteriuria plus pyuria were eligible for
the study.
Nursing home staff identified whether a resident was able
to provide self-consent or required surrogate consent. Assent
wasattemptedforresidentswithsurrogateconsent.Afterwrit-
ten consent, a baseline urine specimen was obtained to en-
sure that subsequent clean catch urine collection was pos-
sible. Subsequent waves of recruitment occurred in each
nursing home every 3 months.
Key Points
Question Do cranberry capsules with sufficient proanthocyanidin
content affect the presence of bacteriuria plus pyuria in older
women living in nursing homes?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 185 women nursing
home residents, after adjusting for missing data and covariates,
there was no statistically significant difference in presence of
bacteriuria plus pyuria between the treatment (29.1%) and control
(29.0%) groups over 1 year.
Meaning Among older women living in nursing homes, cranberry
capsules, compared with placebo, did not have a significant effect
on the presence of bacteriuria plus pyuria over 1 year.

Randomization and Intervention
Participants were randomly assigned to take 2 cranberry cap-
sules (manufactured by Pharmatoka, each containing
36 mg of proanthocyanidins, confirmed by BL-DMAC)18 or
2 placebo capsules, once a day, using a permuted block
design with a variable block size (randomly set to 4 or 6) and
equal allocation (Figure 1). Stratification by nursing home
accounted for potentially different standards of care. The
trial statistician designed the randomization scheme, the sta-
tistical programmer implemented it, and the Investigational
Drug Services pharmacist made treatment assignments. Only
the statistical programmer and pharmacist had access to the
randomization codes during enrollment. Cranberry or pla-
cebo capsules were administered for 360 days (ie, 12 thirty-
day blister packs per participant), and the total surveillance
of each participant was 365 days.

Data and Outcomes
Research nurses recorded baseline descriptive characteristics
from review of the medical chart including age, race, ethnic-
ity, medications, comorbidities, and history of UTI. The pri-
mary nurse or certified nursing assistant (CNA) was
asked questions adapted from the Minimum Data Set
regarding cognitive status, behavior, activities of daily living,
continence, and degree of mobility, similar to previously con-
ducted studies.15,19,20 At study initiation in each nursing
home, the senior intervention nurse educator organized
a series of “in-service” training sessions for nurses and
CNAs regarding methods of urine specimen collection and
capsule administration. Clean catch urine specimens were
targeted for collection in containers with Boritex (boric acid
preservative tablet keeping urine stable for up to 96 hours)
by nursing home staff between 5 and 7 AM to optimize
pharmacokinetic properties of proanthocyanidins8 and
feasibility of collection and then were refrigerated once
obtained. If the specimen was not collected on the due date,
attempts at specimen collection continued for 2 additional
weeks at any time of the day before classifying the specimen
as missing. All specimens were transported in a cooler to Yale
New Haven Health on the day obtained for processing at a
single central laboratory.
Surveillance for the primary outcome (ie, the presence
of bacteriuria plus pyuria) occurred every 2 months after
randomization for a total of 6 assessments over 12 months.
Urine specimens were obtained by clean catch since cath-
eterization of participants requiring surrogate consent
was not authorized by the institutional review board (IRB).
Presence of bacteriuria was defined as at least 105 colony-
forming units (CFUs) per milliliter of 1 or 2 organisms.
Absence of bacteriuria was defined as a urine culture with no
growth, mixed flora (≥3 organisms), or less than the highest
quantitation of bacteriuria reported by the laboratory. Pyuria
was defined as any number of white blood cells on urinalysis
as in a previous study.11 Any positive specimen during the
surveillance period was considered a positive primary out-
come. Two members of the outcome adjudication commit-
tee, blinded to treatment assignment, reviewed the primary
outcomes. Urinary tract–specific symptoms were assessed at
each bimonthly assessment.
Secondary outcomes included symptomatic UTI, all-
cause death, all-cause hospitalization, all multidrug
antibiotic–resistant organisms, antibiotics for suspected
UTI, and total antimicrobial prescriptions. Symptomatic
UTI, adapted from National Healthcare Safety Network cri-
teria, was defined as
1. (a) acute dysuria or (b) fever or leukocytosis and at
least 1 of the following symptoms: acute costovertebral
angle pain or tenderness; suprapubic pain; gross hematuria,
new or marked increase in incontinence, urgency, or fre-
quency or (c) 2 or more of new or marked increase in incon-
tinence, urgency, frequency, suprapubic pain, new gross
hematuria; and
2. (a) a voided urine culture with 105 CFUs/mL or more
of a single predominant organism or 2 gram-negative organ-
isms or (b) a specimen collected by in and out catheter with
102 CFUs/mL or more of any number of organisms (criteria 1
and 2 must be met).21 All antimicrobials administered during
the trial were recorded via chart review. Multidrug-resistant
organisms were defined as methicillin-resistant Staphylococ-
cus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE),
and multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli (ie, defined as
resistance to ≥3 of the following antibiotics: ampicillin-
sulbactam, cefazolin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, fluoroquino-
lones, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, imipenem, and
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole).22
Adherence was determined by the number of capsules
administered to each participant relative to the prescribed
number. Thirty-day blister packs were delivered each
month; adherence was determined from the number of cap-
sules remaining from the previous 30-day supply. Reasons
for lack of adherence were obtained from review of the
medication administration record. High adherence was
defined as administration of 80% or more of prescribed cap-
sules. All adverse events were recorded based on chart
review and discussion with nursing staff on a monthly
basis. A safety report was generated every 6 months and
reviewed by an independent safety monitor.
Statistical Analyses
All analyses were performed by intention to treat (ie, par-
ticipants were analyzed as randomized, regardless of adher-
ence). A 2-sided P value of .05 was used for the level of sta-
tistical significance. SAS 9.4 statistical software23 was used
for analyses. Sample size was determined to detect a differ-
ence between the proportion with bacteriuria plus pyuria
over time in the treatment vs placebo group using the
method of Diggle et al24 for repeated binary outcomes. The
following assumptions were made for this sample size cal-
culation: type I error of 5% (2-sided), 80% power, a serial
correlation of 0.35 between 6 repeated participant out-
comes, an overall bacteriuria plus pyuria rate of 0.45 in the
control group,15 a 33% lower rate of bacteriuria plus pyuria
in the treatment group (ie, bacteriuria plus pyuria rate of
0.30),11 and 20% inflation for deaths, transfers, and missing
cultures. Based on these assumptions, the total sample size
was 180 participants (90 per group).
The adjusted analysis of the primary outcome was con-
ducted using generalized estimating equations (GEE) with
inverse probability weighting at the observation level for
missing monotone values. The SAS PROC GEE procedure,
which permits explicit modeling of the missing data mecha-
nism as the means for determining inverse probability
weights, was used instead of the initially planned general-
ized linear mixed model. Missing intermittent values and
2-month values for participants with no recorded outcomes
were singly imputed using the fully conditional specifica-
tion method, a prerequisite for using the inverse probability
weighting GEE method.25 This regression-modeling
approach for handling missing values under the assumption
of data missing at random was chosen because of the unex-
pected amount and mechanism of the missing data because
it allowed for the explicit modeling of the missing data
mechanism without adding covariates to the regression

model that were not prespecified and because it avoided
making unreasonable assumptions regarding random
effects needed for a generalized linear mixed model with
binary outcomes. Prespecified baseline variables for bacteri-
uria, incontinence, age at enrollment, and number of
comorbidities were included in the model as covariates. A
covariate for surveillance time was also added and assessed
both for its linear association with the outcome and for its
interaction with treatment. An unstructured correlation
matrix was used to model the serial correlation of repeated
participant outcomes.
The adjusted percentage with bacteriuria plus pyuria for
each treatment group at each surveillance time point was
estimated by transforming the GEE model estimates using
an inverse logit link function. The secondary outcomes were
analyzed by a generalized linear regression model with a
Poisson distribution, a treatment status explanatory vari-
able, a natural logarithm of the time at risk as an offset, and
adjustments for overdispersion (see Protocol in Supplement
1 and the eAppendix in Supplement 2 for additional details
of all methods). Because the primary proposed mechanism
of action of cranberry products is targeted toward E coli,
exploratory analyses examined the percentage of E coli uri-
nary isolates vs others that met the criteria for bacteriuria in
bimonthly urine specimens. Additionally, exploratory
analyses of participants without bacteriuria plus pyuria at
baseline were conducted. No tests of significance were con-
ducted for exploratory analyses.
Results
Figure 1 shows the flow of nursing homes and study partici-
pants. From August 24, 2012, through October 7, 2014, 5045
nursing home residents in 21 nursing homes were screened
for participation, 806 (16.0%) of whom were eligible, 248
(30.8%) of those consented, and 185 (74.6%) of those who
consented were able to provide a baseline clean catch urine
specimen and be randomized. Surrogate consent had to be
obtained for 93.5% of participants. Surveillance for all out-
come and safety data ended on October 26, 2015. Table 1
displays the baseline demographic characteristics of partici-
pants. The mean age of participants was 86.4 years (SD,
8.2). The treatment and control groups were generally com-
parable. Rates of incontinence, bacteriuria, and number of
episodes of UTI in the past year were similar; however, the
control group had more coexisting conditions, specifically
arrhythmia and hemiplegia.
One hundred forty-seven participants completed 1 year of
surveillance, and 33 participants died. Twenty participants, 9
in the treatment group and 11 in the control group, became in-
continent prior to the first outcome assessment and were un-
able to provide any of the scheduled urine specimens. Over the
course of the study, 45 participants stopped taking the cap-
sules, 24 in the treatment and 21 in the control groups; 21 re-
fused, 19 transitioned to hospice care, 4 started taking warfa-
rin, and 1 refused via family.
Overall adherence to capsule administration was 80.1%,
77.5% in the treatment group and 82.6% in the control group.
Adherence was 83.7% (n = 185) in the first 6 months and 76.7%
(n = 168) in the second 6 months.
Table 2 depicts the percentage of urine specimens that
met the primary outcome of bacteriuria plus pyuria over 12
months of surveillance. The overall unadjusted results
showed rates of 25.5% (95% CI, 18.6%-33.9%) in the treat-
ment group vs 29.5% (95% CI, 22.2%-37.9%) in the control
group. The adjusted analysis, accounting for missing data
and prespecified covariates, showed no significant differ-
ence between groups (29.1% vs 29.0%; OR, 1.01; 95% CI,
0.61-1.66; P = .98; Figure 2). Of the 723 urinary specimens
obtained, 9 participants (7 with 1 symptom [3 in treatment
group, 4 in control group] and 2 with 2 symptoms [1 in each
group]) had urinary tract–specific symptoms at a bimonthly
assessment.
Of 350 episodes of clinically suspected UTI in 131 partici-
pants, there were 10 symptomatic UTIs in the treatment

group (8 participants with 1 episode and 1 participant with 2
episodes) and 12 symptomatic UTIs in the control group
(7 participants with 1 episode, 1 participant with 2 episodes,
and 1 participant with 3 episodes). Although blood cultures
were requested for 35 episodes of clinically suspected
UTI, there was only 1 episode of septicemia, which occurred
in the control group. Table 3 shows that there were no sig-
nificant differences in rates of death, hospitalization,
multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli bacteriuria (from
scheduled and suspected UTI urine cultures), antibiotics
administered for suspected UTI, or total antimicrobial utili-
zation. There was one MRSA urinary isolate identified in
the treatment group and no VRE urinary isolates identified.
There were a total of 3830 adverse events (eTable 1 in
Supplement 2), 116 serious (83 hospitalizations and 33
deaths, all protocol-unrelated and anticipated) and 3714
nonserious (14 protocol-related and anticipated). The fre-
quency of the 14 protocol-related and anticipated nonseri-
ous adverse events (ie, altered mental status, gastrointesti-
nal disturbance, oral cavity disturbance, skin and soft tissue
event, weight loss) was similar in both treatment groups.
Exploratory analyses of the percentage of E coli isolates
showed that in the treatment group, the percentage of E coli
at study start was 19.6%, at month 2 was 25%; month 4, 20.6%;
month 6, 15.6%; month 8, 20.0%; month 10, 17.7%; and month
12, 22.7%. In the control group, the percentage of E coli at study
start was 21.5%, at month 2 was 23.1%; month 4, 24.6%; month
6, 22.4%; month 8, 18.3%; month 10, 18.5%; and month 12,
17.4%.Exploratoryanalysesinthesubsetof127women(n = 66
in the treatment group, n = 61 in the control group) who did
not have bacteriuria plus pyuria at baseline showed that the
overall rate of bacteriuria plus pyuria over 1 year was 15%
(n = 39) in the treatment group and 11.4% (n = 28) in the con-
trol group (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
Despite prior studies demonstrating that cranberry juice
reduced bacteriuria plus pyuria in older women and that 2
cranberry capsules with 72 mg of proanthocyanidins (equiva-
lent to 20 ounces of cranberry juice) was an appropriate dose
to test,11,15,26 the findings from this trial demonstrated no sig-
nificant difference in presence of bacteriuria plus pyuria
among women who received cranberry capsules vs placebo
over 1 year. The lack of statistically significant differences in
any of the secondary outcomes is consistent with this find-
ing. Many studies of cranberry products have been con-
ducted over several decades with conflicting evidence of its
utility for UTI prevention. The results have led to the recom-
mendation that cranberry products do not prevent UTI over-
all but may be effective in older women.9,27 This trial did not
show a benefit of cranberry capsules in terms of a lower pres-
ence of bacteriuria plus pyuria among older women living in
nursing homes.
Some studies evaluated cranberry products solely among
older adults. In a recent Cochrane review,9 2 reports showed
a reduction in bacteriuria plus pyuria,11,26 whereas 2 others
did not show a clinical benefit of cranberry products.14,16 In 1
study of older women in nursing homes and assisted living
facilities, 300 mL of cranberry juice cocktail containing 36
mg of proanthocyanidins showed a benefit, but the placebo
group had a higher rate of prior history of UTI and likely
higher risk of bacteriuria plus pyuria.28 A more recent study
of 1 cranberry capsule twice a day (18 mg proanthocyanidins
total) in long-term care facility residents with high risk of UTI
(ie, need for long-term catheterization, diabetes mellitus, or
at least 1 UTI in the preceding year) showed that participants
receiving cranberry capsules had a lower incidence of clini-
cally defined UTI (ie, one of the following: specific and non-
specific micturition-related symptoms and signs; a positive
nitrite, leukocyte esterase, dipslide, or culture; antibiotic
treatment for UTI; or UTI reported in the medical record).
The UTI definition used was very broad, and there was no
difference between the treatment and control groups using a
strict UTI definition or for either definition in the low risk UTI
group. Hence, cranberry capsules have not shown meaning-
ful clinical benefit and have not been cost-effective.29,30
There are several potential explanations for why cran-
berry capsules, compared with placebo, did not result in a
difference in the presence of bacteriuria plus pyuria in this
trial. First, there appeared to be an initial effect on bacteriuria
plus pyuria in the first 6 months, but these rates returned to
baseline in the second 6 months of study. Slightly lower
adherence in the second 6 months could have contributed to
this finding. Additionally, it is possible that because of wors-
ening incontinence and changes to the vaginal microbiome
with age, the effects of cranberry capsules were not sus-
tained. Although the exploratory analysis of those without
bacteriuria plus pyuria at baseline is limited because the ben-
efit of randomization is lost, it did not support the premise

that cranberry capsules prevented bacteriuria plus pyuria
over the surveillance period. Second, cranberry capsules do
not provide the hydration of cranberry juice. A recent study
among women undergoing elective gynecological surgery
with urinary catheter removal showed that 2 cranberry cap-
sules twice a day (equivalent to 16 ounces of cranberry juice)
over 6 weeks were able to reduce the rate of UTI by half.31
However, all participants were instructed to drink 8 ounces
of water twice a day with each capsule administration, so it is
possible that the fluid load was necessary along with cran-
berry product. Hydration may also be a necessary component
to reduce bacteriuria and urinary symptoms in older
women.5 Third, although adherence was high as measured
by capsules removed from the blister pack, participants
might not have actually ingested the capsules.
This trial had several strengths. Nursing home residents
exclusively were enrolled, the dose of proanthocyanidins was
standardized, adherence to capsule administration by the
planned assessment method was high, and nursing home
staff were trained to optimize outcome assessments. How-
ever, this trial also had limitations. First, since participants
could not be catheterized to obtain bimonthly urine speci-
mens, only residents capable of providing a clean catch urine
specimen were randomized. Exclusion of residents for com-
plete incontinence limited the generalizability of these find-
ings. For randomized participants, 20 became incontinent
prior to the first outcome assessment and were unable to pro-
vide any urine specimens. Others became incontinent or
were transitioned to hospice care, so urine specimens were
not obtained. Nevertheless, 65% of planned urine specimens
were collected. Second, 78 nursing homes either did not
respond or declined to participate and 7 agreed to participate
but subsequently declined. Third, antiadhesion of E coli to
uroepithelial cells in the urine specimens of participants in
the trial was not tested. Adhesion studies to date have been
conducted on patients enrolled for relatively short observa-
tion periods.7,8 Since there were multiple assessment time
points and it was not possible to ensure adherence to capsule
ingestion on the day prior to obtaining a urine specimen for
adhesion testing, the antiadhesion testing was not feasible.
Fourth, the baseline rate of bacteriuria plus pyuria and per-
centage of E coli bacteriuria in this trial population was lower
than in the pilot dosing study.15 Fifth, this study enrolled
women with or without bacteriuria plus pyuria at baseline.
Therefore, it was not possible to definitively determine the
specific role of cranberry capsules for prevention of new
occurrence of bacteriuria plus pyuria among women without
bacteriuria plus pyuria at baseline nor for reduction of bacte-
riuria plus pyuria among women with prevalent bacteriuria
plus pyuria at baseline.
Conclusions
Among older women residing in nursing homes, administra-
tion of cranberry capsules compared with placebo resulted
in no significant difference in presence of bacteriuria plus
pyuria over 1 year.
