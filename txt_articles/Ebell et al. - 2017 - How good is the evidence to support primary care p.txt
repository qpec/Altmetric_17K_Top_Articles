Abstract
Our goal was to determine the extent to which 
recommendations for primary care practice are informed 
by high-quality research-based evidence, and the extent 
to which they are based on evidence of improved health 
outcomes (patient-oriented evidence). As a substrate for 
study, we used Essential Evidence, an online, evidence-
based, medical reference for generalists. Each of the 721 
chapters makes overall recommendations for practice that 
are graded A, B or C using the Strength of Recommendations 
Taxonomy (SORT). SORT A represents consistent and good 
quality patient-oriented evidence; SORT B is inconsistent 
or limited quality patient-oriented evidence and SORT 
C is expert opinion, usual practice or recommendations 
relying on surrogate or intermediate outcomes. Pairs of 
researchers abstracted the evidence ratings for each chapter 
in tandem, with discrepancies resolved by the lead author. 
Of 3251 overall recommendations, 18% were graded ‘A’, 
34% were ‘B’ and 49% were ‘C’
. Clinical categories with the 
most ‘A’ recommendations were pregnancy and childbirth, 
cardiovascular, and psychiatric; those with the least were 
haematological, musculoskeletal and rheumatological, 
and poisoning and toxicity. ‘A’ level recommendations 
were most common for therapy and least common for 
diagnosis. Only 51% of recommendations are based on 
studies reporting patient-oriented outcomes, such as 
morbidity, mortality, quality of life or symptom reduction. 
In conclusion, approximately half of the recommendations 
for primary care practice are based on patient-oriented 
evidence, but only 18% are based on patient-oriented 
evidence from consistent, high-quality studies.
Introduction
Taking an evidence-based approach to practice means 
that physicians and other healthcare providers should 
make a conscientious effort to base clinical decisions on 
research-based evidence that is most likely to be free 
from bias, and integrated with clinical skills and patient 
values.1 Evidence-based practice (EBP) has been an 
important paradigm shift in modern healthcare educa-
tion and practice. Increasingly, medical references are 
taking a more rigorous, evidence-based approach to 
creating content, and some now systematically grade 
the strength of evidence for clinical recommendations.2 
‘Information Mastery’, initially described by Slawson 
and Shaughnessy in 1994, adds a formal assessment of 
relevance to the assessment of validity, and suggests that 
physicians can reduce the work of finding evidence by 
relying on high-quality secondary sources of informa-
tion. They emphasise that changes in practice should be 
based on research that is free of bias and also demon-
strates improvements in patient-oriented outcomes, such 
as morbidity, mortality, quality of life and symptom 
improvement.3 4
Previous studies have examined the extent to which 
physician decisions are based on high-quality evidence. 
Evidence from randomised trials supported 14% of thoracic 
surgical treatments,5 48% of interventions in an inpatient 
palliative care unit,6 43% of ophthalmology interventions,7 
65% of psychiatric interventions,8 24% of surgical inter-
ventions,9 59% of outpatient primary care10 and 50%–53% 
of recommendations in medical inpatients.11 12 In these

Summary box
What is already known about this subject?
 
► Clinicians are encouraged to base their 
practice on the best available evidence.
 
► However, much evidence is derived from 
subspecialty populations or addresses 
rare, uncommon problems.
 
► The extent to which recommendations for 
primary care practice are guided by high-
quality evidence is unknown.
What are the new findings?
 
► In a primary care-oriented medical 
reference, 18% of recommendations 
were based on consistent, high-quality 
patient-oriented evidence (Strength of 
Recommendations Taxonomy (SORT) A), 
while approximately half were based on 
expert opinion, usual care or disease-
oriented evidence (SORT C).
 
► Clinical categories with the most A 
recommendations were pregnancy and 
childbirth, cardiovascular, and psychiatric.
 
► Categories with the least were 
haematological, musculoskeletal and 
rheumatological, and poisoning and 
toxicity.
How might it impact clinical practice in the 
foreseeable future?
Primary care physicians should be aware 
that only a minority of recommendations 
are based on high-quality, patient-oriented 
evidence. This highlights the need for regular 
literature surveillance by primary care 
physicians to identify stronger evidence as 
it is developed. More research is needed in 
the primary care setting that evaluates the 
impact of interventions on patient-oriented 
health outcomes. Progress could be measured 
by periodically re-evaluating the percentage 
of recommendations based on high-quality 
evidence.

studies, the denominators are the decisions made by indi-
vidual clinicians.
Essential Evidence Plus (http://www. 
essentialevid-
enceplus. 
com) is a comprehensive online medical refer-
ence published by Wiley-Blackwell. Its primary audi-
ence is primary care physicians, emergency physicians 
and hospitalists. Use of this reference has been shown to 
improve knowledge and attitudes towards EBP,13–15 and, 
in combination with daily evidence summaries emailed 
to subscribers, leads to practice change and improve-
ment.16 17 Essential Evidence Plus includes 742 chapters, 
each focused on a different symptom, disease or proce-
dure, as well as extensive collections of clinical calcu-
lators, decision support tools and critical appraisals of 
individual studies. It was designed around the principles 
of information mastery, with an emphasis on delivering 
valid, relevant, patient-oriented evidence. Each chapter 
uses the same organisational structure, based on a vali-
dated taxonomy of physician’s questions at the point of 
care,18 19 and includes from 2 to 12 ‘Overall Bottom-Line’ 
recommendations for clinicians. These recommendations 
are graded ‘A’, ‘B’ or ‘C’ using the Strength of Recommen-
dations Taxonomy (SORT), which integrates evaluation of 
relevance and validity (table 1). The SORT taxonomy was 
developed by the editors of family medicine journals and 
in addition to Essential Evidence is used by American 
Family Physician and the Journal of Family Practice, to 
widely read primary care journals in the USA.20
In the current study, we use the clinical recom-
mendations made in Essential Evidence to better 
understand the extent to which recommendations for 
primary care practice are informed by high-quality 
research-based evidence. We also examine the extent 
to which these recommendations are based on rele-
vant, patient-oriented evidence rather than expert 
opinion or disease-oriented evidence.
Methods
Methodology for evidence grading
The SORT system is used to grade each recommendation 
made in Essential Evidence as A, B or C (table 1). The 
strength of the SORT system is its simplicity, and the fact 
that it addresses both relevance and validity. Evidence 
is relevant if it is based on patient oriented rather than 
disease oriented or surrogate outcomes, and it is valid if 
the study was designed to avoid important biases and if 
studies are generally consistent in their findings. Level 
A and B recommendations must be based on evidence 
of improved patient-oriented outcomes, and level A 
recommendations additionally require that the evidence 
be consistent and free of important biases.
Each topic has ‘Overall Bottom-Line’ recommenda-
tions that reflect the most important recommendations 
regarding prevention, diagnosis, treatment and prog-
nosis for each topic. The prevention (optional), diag-
nosis, treatment and prognosis sections each also have 
key recommendations graded using SORT.
The recommendations are written and graded by the 
author of each topic. The accuracy of each evidence 
grade is confirmed by an associate editor and by the 
editor-in-chief (MHE) during the editorial process. Each 
topic is reviewed every 4 months by an editor to add or 
update relevant Cochrane reviews and important orig-
inal research, and is evaluated in detail every 1–2 years 
by the author and editor.
Topic classification
Topics were classified as belonging primarily to one 
organ system or specialty classification by the editor-in-
chief of the publication. While each topic may be classi-
fied in two different categories within the reference, for 
example, pulmonary embolism may be considered both 
cardiovascular and respiratory, and postpartum depres-
sion both pregnancy and psychiatric, for the purpose of 
this analysis a single primary classification was selected.
Data abstraction
Essential Evidence has 742 chapters (also called topics). 
Of these, 21 do not include clinical recommendations, 
primarily because they describe how to perform a proce-
dure, and were excluded. This left 721 topics for our review, 
which were divided into three groups of topics. Each group 
of approximately 240 topics was reviewed by two of the 
authors to abstract the category (overall, prevention, diag-
nosis, treatment and prognosis) and grade (A, B or C) of 
each recommendation for each topic. Reviewers reconciled 
any discrepancies (which were rare) by referring back to 
the chapter to reach consensus agreement.
Results
The 721 Essential Evidence topics included in our 
study made a total of 3251 ‘Overall Bottom-Line’

recommendations. These recommendations summarised 
the key points for clinicians related to prevention, diag-
nosis, treatment and prognosis. Thus, each chapter had 
a mean of 4.5 and a median of 4 ‘Overall Bottom-Line’ 
recommendations for practice (range 2–12). There were 
an additional 6828 recommendations in the subsections 
on prevention, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. The 
evidence grading is summarised in table 2.
Just over half (51%) of the ‘Overall Bottom-Line’ 
recommendations were based on patient-oriented 
evidence from original research (A or B). Recommen-
dations regarding diagnosis were less likely to be based 
on patient-oriented evidence (A or B) than those for 
prevention, treatment or prognosis (23% vs 57%–65%). 
Because diagnostic accuracy alone is not considered a 
patient-oriented outcome, studies focusing on accuracy 
alone cannot be rated higher than C. A diagnostic study 
could be an A or B if a study demonstrated that use of 
the test improved a patient-oriented outcome.
Table 3 summarises the percentage of ‘Overall Bottom-
Line’ recommendations that are based on patient-ori-
ented evidence (A or B) for each organ system/specialty 
category. Five categories had at least 60% A or B recom-
mendations: pregnancy and childbirth, cardiovascular,

oncology, psychiatric and neurology. Categories with the 
most C recommendations (ie, based on expert opinion or 
disease-oriented evidence) were poisoning and toxicity, 
eye diseases, ear, nose and throat/allergy, and endocri-
nology.
Level A recommendations are based on original 
research reporting consistent, high-quality, patient-ori-
ented evidence. Only 18% of ‘Overall Bottom-Line’ 
recommendations were based on A level evidence. Level 
A recommendations were more common for treatment, 
not surprising given the greater emphasis on and funding 
for randomised trials of therapy than for trials comparing 
diagnostic strategies. They were most common in the 
clinical categories of pregnancy and childbirth (36%), 
cardiovascular (30%), psychiatric (28%) and respiratory 
(23%), and least common in poisoning and toxicity (4%), 
haematology (8%), and musculoskeletal and rheumato-
logical (11%).
Discussion
Previous studies have used observation of physician 
decisions6–12 to determine the extent to which physi-
cian decisions are based on high-quality evidence. In 
this study, we take a novel approach that evaluates the 
strength of evidence for a broad range of conditions in 
primary care and also assesses the extent to which that 
evidence is based on patient-oriented outcomes. This has 
the advantage of providing a more complete picture of 
the evidence supporting a wide range of clinical condi-
tions, and has the potential to help us understand which 
fields have the greatest need for further research.
Few medical references rate the strength of evidence 
of all key clinical recommendations. One is Clinical 
Evidence, which reported that 11% of the treatments 
reported in randomised trials were beneficial and 
another 24% were likely to be beneficial (http:// 
clinica-
levidence. 
com/ 
x/set/ 
static/ 
cms/ 
efficacy- 
categorisations. 
html). We are not aware of any other comprehensive 
general medical reference that systematically rates the 
strength of evidence for all key clinical recommenda-
tions, or that systematically assess whether recommen-
dations are based on patient-oriented evidence.
Our study used a different denominator than the 
previous observational studies of physician practice. 
While previous studies primarily examined recommen-
dations made by physicians under observation in clin-
ical practice, we considered all clinical recommendations 
for a broad range of symptoms and diseases. Neverthe-
less, we found that the percentage of recommendations 
based on good or fair quality patient-oriented evidence 
(51%) was similar to that seen in observational studies 
of medical inpatients and outpatient primary care 
(50%–59%).10–12 A study of the 2711 recommendations 
in 14 cardiology guidelines found that 11% were level A 
evidence, 41% level B, and 48% level C, although these 
guidelines used slightly different grade definitions (A, 
multiple randomised trials or meta-analyses; B, single 
randomised trial or non-randomised trials; C, expert 
opinion, case studies or standards of care).21
Fields with an extensive tradition of performing 
randomised trials (cardiology, oncology and perina-
tology) had the highest percentage of A or B recommen-
dations. Fields with the fewest A or B recommendations 
may have fewer clinical trials, or those trials may not 
measure patient-oriented outcomes, such as morbidity, 
mortality, symptoms or quality of life. For example, 
many studies of diabetes mellitus focus on glycaemic 
control, a surrogate outcome. These studies can be rated 
no higher than C using the SORT system, a decision that 
has been validated by recent studies showing lack of 
benefit and even harm from overly tight control of blood 
glucose.22–24
Limitations of the study include the fact that the 
reference is primarily designed for use by generalist 
physicians, emergency physicians and hospitalists; 
some highly specialised topics and diseases may be 
under-represented. However, this is likely to be a much 
more comprehensive set of recommendations than those 
observed in clinical practice, where physicians deal 
with a smaller subset of conditions on most days. The 
inter-rater reliability of the SORT system has not been 
formally assessed, but each rating is reviewed by the 
author, an assistant or associate editor, and the editor-
in-chief (who developed the system and has used it for 
9 years). It will be interesting to repeat this study in 10 
years, to see if the percentage of recommendations based 
on high-quality, patient-oriented evidence is increasing.
Our findings point to a clear need for more research 
that 
evaluates 
improvement 
in 
patient-oriented 
outcomes, particularly in fields, such as endocrinology, 
ophthalmology, ear nose and throat/allergy, and haema-
tology, as well as a need for more high-quality research 
on common primary care problems in general. Studies 
comparing diagnostic strategies and evaluating the 
effect of these strategies on patient-oriented outcomes 
are also lacking, and will be important as we assess the 
incremental value of diagnostic technologies. Examples 
of this type of study include a comparison of strategies 
using B-natriuretic peptide with those that did not have 
this information for the evaluation of dyspnoea,25 and 
studies of the impact of clinical decision rules such as 
the Strep Score or Ottawa Ankle Rules.26–28 However, 
they are relatively rare in the literature. Another poten-
tial area of study is evaluation of the inter-rater reli-
ability of the SORT system, as well as other evidence 
classification schemes.
In conclusion, approximately half of the recom-
mendations for primary care practice are based on 
patient-oriented evidence, but only 18% are based on 
patient-oriented evidence from consistent, high-quality 
studies.
