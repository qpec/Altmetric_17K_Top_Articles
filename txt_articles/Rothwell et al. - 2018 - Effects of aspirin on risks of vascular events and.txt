Summary
Background A one-dose-fits-all approach to use of aspirin has yielded only modest benefits in long-term prevention of 
cardiovascular events, possibly due to underdosing in patients of large body size and excess dosing in patients of 
small body size, which might also affect other outcomes.
Methods Using individual patient data, we analysed the modifying effects of bodyweight (10 kg bands) and height 
(10 cm bands) on the effects of low doses (≤100 mg) and higher doses (300–325 mg or ≥500 mg) of aspirin in 
randomised trials of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular events. We stratified the findings by age, sex, and 
vascular risk factors, and validated them in trials of aspirin in secondary prevention of stroke. Additionally, we 
assessed whether any weight or height dependence was evident for the effect of aspirin on 20-year risk of colorectal 
cancer or any in-trial cancer.
Results Among ten eligible trials of aspirin in primary prevention (including 117 279 participants), bodyweight varied 
four-fold and trial median weight ranged from 60·0 kg to 81·2 kg (p<0·0001). The ability of 75–100 mg aspirin to 
reduce cardiovascular events decreased with increasing weight (pinteraction=0·0072), with benefit seen in people 
weighing 50–69 kg (hazard ratio [HR] 0·75 [95% CI 0·65–0·85]) but not in those weighing 70 kg or more (0·95 
[0·86–1·04]; 1·09 [0·93–1·29] for vascular death). Furthermore, the case fatality of a first cardiovascular event was 
increased by low-dose aspirin in people weighing 70 kg or more (odds ratio 1·33 [95% CI 1·08–1·64], p=0·0082). 
Higher doses of aspirin (≥325 mg) had the opposite interaction with bodyweight (difference pinteraction=0·0013), 
reducing cardiovascular events only at higher weight (pinteraction=0·017). Findings were similar in men and women, in 
people with diabetes, in trials of aspirin in secondary prevention, and in relation to height (pinteraction=0·0025 for 
cardiovascular events). Aspirin-mediated reductions in long-term risk of colorectal cancer were also weight 
dependent (pinteraction=0·038). Stratification by body size also revealed harms due to excess dosing: risk of sudden death 
was increased by aspirin in people at low weight for dose (pinteraction=0·0018) and risk of all-cause death was increased 
in people weighing less than 50 kg who were receiving 75–100 mg aspirin (HR 1·52 [95% CI 1·04–2·21], p=0·031). 
In participants aged 70 years or older, the 3-year risk of cancer was also increased by aspirin (1·20 [1·03–1·47], 
p=0·02), particularly in those weighing less than 70 kg (1·31 [1·07–1·61], p=0·009) and consequently in women 
(1·44 [1·11–1·87], p=0·0069).
Interpretation Low doses of aspirin (75–100 mg) were only effective in preventing vascular events in patients weighing 
less than 70 kg, and had no benefit in the 80% of men and nearly 50% of all women weighing 70 kg or more. By 
contrast, higher doses of aspirin were only effective in patients weighing 70 kg or more. Given that aspirin’s effects on 
other outcomes, including cancer, also showed interactions with body size, a one-dose-fits-all approach to aspirin is 
unlikely to be optimal, and a more tailored strategy is required.

Introduction
Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible 
acetylation of the cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, 
resulting in almost complete inhibition of thromboxane 
production by platelets.1 However, aspirin yields only 
modest long-term reductions in vascular events,2,3 which 
has led investigators to develop alternative antiplatelet 
drugs and to study the effects of their combination 
with aspirin and of dual treatment with anticoagulant 
drugs. Yet the disparity between the effect of aspirin on 
thromboxane production and its clinical benefits might 
be due, at least in part, to the one-dose-fits-all approach 
used in trials and clinical practice, particularly the use of 
low doses in individuals with higher bodyweight. Obesity 
and increased body-mass index (BMI) are associated with 
reduced inhibition of COX-1 by low doses of aspirin, 
probably due to increased platelet activation or turnover,4,5 
but high lean body mass could also reduce the systemic 
bioavailability of aspirin. Aspirin is rapidly de-acetylated 
by esterases in the intestinal wall, plasma, red blood cells,

and liver,6 and so the proportion of a fixed dose that 
reaches the systemic circulation will depend on the mass 
of these tissues, which is correlated with lean body size. 
Given that aspirin acetylates several highly abundant 
proteins such as albumin, haemoglobin, and fibrinogen, 
their masses might also affect the systemic bioavailability 
of aspirin. Although about 50% of an oral dose of aspirin 
reaches the portal circulation6—and can therefore inhibit 
circulating platelets—reduced systemic bioavailability 
could restrict inhibition of COX-1 in megakariocytes and, 
hence, in the 10–15% of new platelets that are released 
daily.7 Thus, reduced systemic bioavailability of once-
daily, low-dose aspirin at higher lean body mass could 
reduce clinical effectiveness, especially if doses are 
missed. Total bodyweight could be a particularly powerful 
de 
terminant of clinical effects if obesity also increases 
platelet turnover.
Higher doses of aspirin should overcome any reduced 
bioavailability with increasing body size, but might be 
excessive in patients with low bodyweight because of 
reduced endothelial prostacyclin production due to high 
systemic levels of aspirin8 or possibly because of increased 
salicylate levels. If the effectiveness of lower doses 
decreases, and the effectiveness of higher doses increases, 
with increasing body size, then weight–dose interactions 
could explain why low-dose aspirin appears to prevent 
stroke only in women,9 and high doses only in men,10 
despite them having similar BMIs.
All randomised trials of aspirin in prevention of vascular 
events have tested a one-dose-fits-all approach (ie, one dose 
vs placebo or, occasionally, comparing two different doses 
applied to all), but have differed in the doses chosen. 
Previous analyses of aspirin trials have not found 
consistent effect modification for BMI,3,11 but trials of 
different doses have been analysed together, and BMI is 
poorly correlated with lean body size. In the absence of 
previous analyses, we aimed to investigate the modifying 
effects of weight, height, BMI, and other measures of body 
size on the effectiveness of low and higher doses of aspirin 
in primary prevention of vascular events, with validation in 
trials in secondary prevention of stroke. Given that aspirin 
also has effects on risk of cancer,12,13 which might partly 
depend on platelet inhibition,1 we also investigated 
whether the effect of aspirin on long-term risk of colorectal 
cancer, and on short-term, in-trial risk of any cancer, was 
affected by weight and height.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
Trials of aspirin versus control in primary prevention of 
vascular events were identified from the Antithrombotic 
Trialists’ (ATT) Collaboration,3,11 from other previous 
systematic reviews of trials of aspirin, and from the 
Cochrane Collaboration Database of Systematic Reviews. 
Trials were eligible if they randomly assigned participants 
to daily or alternate-day aspirin versus no aspirin. Trials 
Research in context
Evidence before this study 
A one-dose-fits-all approach to use of aspirin has yielded only 
modest benefits in the long-term prevention of cardiovascular 
events, possibly due to underdosing in patients of high body size 
and excess dosing in those of low body size. Randomised trials of 
aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular events have all 
tested a single dose against a control, but have differed in the 
dose(s) chosen. We identified ten randomised trials of aspirin in 
primary prevention (involving 117 279 participants) from the 
Antithrombotic Trialists’ Collaboration, the Cochrane 
Collaboration Database of Systematic Reviews, and previous 
systematic reviews.
Added value of this study
In the absence of previous analyses, we used individual patient 
data from trials of aspirin versus control in the primary prevention 
of cardiovascular events, stratifying by weight, height, and other 
measures of body size, to identify whether the effects of high and 
low doses of aspirin are modified by these variables. We validated 
findings in trials of aspirin in secondary prevention of stroke, and 
by determining any weight dependence of the effects of aspirin 
on long-term risk of colorectal cancer and on short-term risk of all 
cancer.  We found that the ability of low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg) 
to reduce cardiovascular events declined with increasing weight, 
with substantial benefit at 50–69 kg but no benefit at 70 kg or 
more, and with increased case fatality of first cardiovascular 
events in people weighing 70 kg or more. Higher doses (≥325 mg) 
of aspirin showed a reverse interaction with weight and height, 
reducing cardiovascular events only at larger body size. Findings 
were consistent in men and women, in participants with diabetes, 
and in trials of aspirin in secondary prevention of stroke. 
Reductions in long-term risk of colorectal cancer by aspirin were 
both height and weight dependent. However, stratification by 
body size revealed harms due to excess dosing, with an increase in 
sudden deaths at lower weight and an increase in the short-term 
risk of cancer at lower weight and shorter height in participants 
aged 70 years or older.
Implications of all the available evidence
The optimal dose of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 
depends on bodyweight, driven more by lean body mass and 
height than by body-mass index. Once-daily low doses 
(75–100 mg) of aspirin were ineffective in people weighing 70 kg 
or more, particularly in those who smoke or were treated with 
enteric-coated formulations, whereas higher doses became more 
effective with increasing weight. We also found that the effects of 
aspirin on sudden cardiac death and cancer showed dose–weight 
interactions, suggesting that the one-dose-fits-all strategy for 
daily aspirin is unlikely to be optimal. The substantial reductions 
in cardiovascular events and death at optimal doses for weight 
highlight the potential to improve effectiveness and argue for a 
more tailored dosing strategy.

that included factorial randomisation to other inter-
ventions were also eligible. Trials of aspirin versus 
control in secondary prevention of stroke that randomised 
at least 1000 participants were identified from a previous 
systematic review,14 along with any trials comparing 
different doses of aspirin in the secondary prevention of 
stroke identified by the ATT.3,11 Trials of short-term 
(≤90 days) treatment were excluded. 
For all eligible trials, we obtained individual patient 
data on age, sex, weight, height, and vascular risk 
factors (including smoking status and diabetes status) 
at baseline, and on all major vascular events (including 
stroke [ischaemic, intracerebral, or subarachnoid haemor-
rhage], myocardial infarction, vascular death, other 
coronary death, and other major ischaemic vascular 
events, excluding unstable angina and transient isch-
aemic attack), major bleeds (intracerebral haemorrhage 
and extracranial bleeds that were fatal or required blood 
transfusion or hospital admission), cancers (first cancer, 
excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, diagnosed after 
randomisation), and deaths that occurred during follow-
up. When possible, ATT Collaboration definitions of 
events were used.3,11 When data were available, recurrences 
of pre-trial cancers were excluded, but all deaths due 
to cancer were included in analyses of that outcome. 
The designation of cancer death from the original trials 
was used.
Data were also obtained if trials had coded sudden 
deaths (ie, collapse or unwitnessed death with no known 
non-cardiac cause and no clinical or autopsy evidence 
of fatal myocardial infarction). Dates of randomisation, 
of all events, of withdrawal from randomised treatment, 
and of final follow-up were also obtained. Data on 20-year 
risk of colorectal cancer were obtained from trials of 
aspirin in primary prevention of vascular events that did 
post-trial follow-up.15–20 Methods of post-trial follow-up for 
cancer have been reported previously for four trials,12,13,21,22 
and methods used previously in the UK trials12,13 were 
applied in two further trials.19,20
Statistical analysis
Trials were analysed separately according to whether they 
were investigating aspirin for primary or secondary 
prevention and whether they used low doses (≤100 mg) or 
higher doses (≥300 mg) of aspirin. Primary and secondary 
prevention trials were pooled only if the effect modification 
by weight or height was similar in both settings. Analyses 
of the effects of aspirin were done by intention to treat 
based on randomised allocation, unless otherwise speci-
fied. For analyses stratified by baseline characteristics, 
data on age and sex were complete, data on smoking were 
99·9% complete, and data on weight or height were 
missing in about 0·1% of participants (range 0–1·05; 
appendix pp 2, 3); thus, participants with missing data 
were simply excluded.
Participants in each trial were first dichotomised by 
bodyweight: those weighing less than 70 kg versus those 
weighing 70 kg or more. For each outcome, hazard 
ratios (HRs) were calculated for aspirin versus control in 
each trial, pooled estimates were obtained by fixed-
effects meta-analysis (Mantel-Haenszel-Peto method), 
and hetero 
geneity was calculated with the χ² test. In the 
absence of significant (p<0·05) heterogeneity in estimates 
between trials, individual patient data were pooled and 
the effects of aspirin in people weighing less than 70 kg 
versus those weighing 70 kg or more were estimated 
with a Cox model stratified by trial. Kaplan-Meier curves 
were also generated for time to event and dichotomised 
by bodyweight (<70 kg vs ≥70 kg), with significance 
established by use of the log-rank test stratified by trial. 
Participants without an event were censored on date of 
death or at the end of trial follow-up. This analysis was 
repeated with censoring at time of discontinuation of 
randomised treatment.
Given that aspirin can affect the severity of vascular 
events,14 we also did weight-stratified analyses of the 
effects of aspirin on fatal events only, and on case fatality 
of events for stroke, myocardial infarction, and all 
cardiovascular events during trial follow-up. Additionally, 
we determined the effects of aspirin on risk of all cardio-
vascular events or death from any cause. Because effects 
on fatal events in trials can be diluted by active treatment 
after non-fatal events,23 these analyses were limited to 
death and case fatality due to first events during follow-up 
and were also repeated with censoring at dis 
continuation 
of randomised treatment.
Any interaction between the effect of aspirin on 
outcome and bodyweight was assessed by including in 
the Cox model an interaction term between weight and 
treatment for the analysis of participants weighing less 
than 70 kg versus those weighing 70 kg or more and with 
additional analyses with the interaction term based on 
weight as a continuous variable. Effects of aspirin were 
also determined in 10 kg bands of weight (<50, 50–59, 
60–69, 70–79, 80–89, and ≥90), and in 0·1 m bands 
of height (<1·40, 1·40–1·49, 1·50–1·59, 1·60–1·69, 
1·70–1·79, and ≥1·80), which were shown graphically as 
HRs (95% CIs). When height had been recorded in feet 
and inches, corresponding thresholds in metres were 
estimated. Effects of aspirin were also compared in tall 
(top quintile within each sex) versus shorter (lower four 
quintiles) individuals. Analyses stratified by weight were 
also repeated after exclusion of participants who were 
underweight (BMI <18·5 kg/m²) or who were obese 
(BMI ≥30 kg/m²). Effect modification by other measures 
of body size (including lean body mass, BMI, fat mass, 
and body surface area; definitions are in appendix p 13) 
and by vascular risk factors was also assessed by use of 
interaction terms in Cox models.
Analysis of the effect of aspirin on risk of all cardio—
vascular events stratified by weight was further stratified 
by age (<70 years vs ≥70 years), sex, smoking status 
(current smoker vs previous or never smoker), BMI 
(<25 kg/m² vs ≥25 kg/m²), formulation of aspirin tablet

used (enteric coated or delayed release vs standard 
release), period of follow-up (<3 years vs ≥3 years), and 
whether or not the participant was also randomised to 
vitamin E in trials with this factorial design.
For the effect of aspirin on risk of all cardiovascular 
events, the significance of any differences in effect 
modification by weight and height between low-dose 
(≤100 mg) and higher-dose (≥300 mg) aspirin was 
established with the Mantel-Haenszel-Peto heterogeneity 
statistic for difference between low-dose versus higher-
dose interaction estimates derived from a Cox model 
for weight–treatment or height–treatment interactions.
 In the primary prevention trials with post-trial follow-
up for cancer, the effect of aspirin on the 20-year risk of 
colorectal cancer was stratified by weight in the same 
way as described for vascular events, with additional 
stratification by age (<70 years vs ≥70 years) and dose 
of aspirin (75–100 mg vs ≥300 mg). In all primary 
prevention trials, the same analysis was done for risk of 
first cancer during trial follow-up, with additional 
stratification according to sex, diabetes status, and 
period of follow-up. In line with previous analyses,12–14 
we selected follow-up periods of less than 3 years, 
3–4·9 years, and 5 years or more.

aspirin versus control. We also identified five eligible 
trials28–32 of aspirin in secondary prevention of stroke 
and obtained individual patient data from the four 
largest trials: one of low-dose aspirin versus placebo,28 
two of higher doses of aspirin versus placebo,29,30 and 
one comparing two doses (appendix p 3).31 The only 
other eligible trial32 of low-dose aspirin in secondary 
prevention of stroke did not collect data on weight or 
height.
Bodyweight varied approximately four-fold in each of 
the trials (appendix pp 2, 3). Median weight ranged from 
60·0 kg to 81·2 kg (p<0·0001), in part due to sex 
differences (median weight was 81·0 kg in men and 
68·0 kg in women). Trials also differed in age of 
participants and in number of participants who smoked.
Low-dose aspirin
In the initial meta-analysis of trials of low-dose aspirin 
in primary prevention, pooled odds ratios (ORs) for the 
effect of aspirin on risk of cardiovascular events were 
0·77 (95% CI 0·68–0·87, p<0·0001; pheterogeneity=0·32) for 
participants weighing less than 70 kg versus 0·94 
(0·86–1·04, p=0·24; pheterogeneity=0·50) for those weighing 
70 kg or more (table 1). Given the lack of heterogeneity 
in these effects between studies, we proceeded to do the 
pooled analyses.
In the pooled analysis of trials of low-dose aspirin in 
primary prevention, the ability of 75–100 mg aspirin to 
reduce cardiovascular events decreased with increasing 
weight (pinteraction=0·0072; table 1, figure 1). Low-dose 
aspirin had the greatest effect on cardiovascular events 
in participants weighing 50–69 kg (383 events in 
15 155 participants treated with aspirin vs 504 events 
in 15 145 participants treated with control; HR 0·75 
[95% CI 0·65–0·85]; p<0·0001), particularly with 
daily use (172 of 4432 treated with aspirin vs 245 of 
4400 treated with control; 0·68 [0·56–0·83], p=0·0001; 
figure 1). In the one trial18 of alternate-day dosing, 
100 mg aspirin was effective in participants weighing 
50–59 kg (72 of 4325 vs 102 of 4408; 0·72 [0·52–0·96], 
p=0·025; figure 1) and in those weighing 60–69 kg who 
were not allocated to vitamin E (appendix p 4). However, 
the reduction in cardiovascular events with 75–100 mg 
aspirin in people weighing 50–59 kg was not seen in 
people weighing less than 50 kg (1·25 [0·74–2·09], 
p=0·40; figure 1), who also had an increased risk of all-
cause death (1·52 [1·04–2·21], p=0·031). No hazard was 
evident in people weighing less than 50 kg after exclusion 
of people with a BMI of less than 18·5 kg/m² (19 of 724 vs 
22 of 696; 0·80 [0·43–1·47], p=0·47; figure 1).
Low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg) prevented stroke in 
women but not in men (table 1; pinteraction=0·020), but 
no difference remained after accounting for weight 
(pinteraction=0·20; table 1; appendix p 5). The effect of 
low-dose aspirin on cardiovascular events was not 
modified by the presence of diabetes (weight-adjusted

pinteraction=0·47) or by age (weight-adjusted pinteraction=0·94; 
table 1; appendix p 5) The weight dependence of the 
effect was similar for on-treatment analyses (intention 
to treat vs censoring at treatment discontinuation), for 
early follow-up (0–3 years), and for later (≥3 years) 
follow-up (appendix pp 6, 7). However, the effect of low-
dose aspirin on cardiovascular events was reduced in 
smokers (pinteraction=0·0026; table 1; appendix p 5). Weight 
remained a significant effect modifier after inclusion 
of age, sex, and smoking interactions in the model 
(pinteraction=0·0035). The effects of weight and smoking 
were add 
itive overall (table 2), and were generally 
consistent within individual trials (appendix p 8), with 
possible harm from aspirin in participants who smoked 
and weighed 70 kg or more (table 2). The dual inter-
action with weight and smok 
ing also explained why 
low-dose aspirin prevented myocardial infarction in 
men (HR 0·77 [95% CI 0·66–0·90], p=0·0014) but not in 
women (1·00 [0·84–1·18], p=0·96; pinteraction=0·031), even 
when stratified by weight (table 1). The risk of myocardial 
infarction was only reduced in women who did not 
smoke and weighed less than 70 kg (HR 0·71 [95% CI 
0·52–0·97, p=0·031] vs 1·33 [0·85–2·09, p=0·21] for 
women who smoked and weighed ≥70 kg).
The weight dependence of the effect of low-dose aspirin 
on cardiovascular events was observed for all tablet 
formulations (appendix pp 8,9), but loss of effect in part-
icipants weighing 70 kg or more was more evident for 
enteric-coated or delayed-release aspirin and alternate-
day, standard-release aspirin than for daily, standard-
release aspirin.
In participants weighing 70 kg or more, low-dose 
aspirin (75–100 mg) was associated with an increase in 
case fatality of first cardiovascular events (OR 1·33 
[95% CI 1·08–1·64], p=0·0082; appendix p 10), par-
ticularly for myocardial infarction (1·73 [1·20–2·49], 
p=0·0035), with an overall increase in fatal first cardio-
vascular events in participants aged 70 years or older 
(HR 1·45 [95% CI 1·01–2·10], p=0·04).
The increased risk of major bleeding on low-dose 
aspirin versus control was lost in participants weighing 
90 kg or more (pinteraction=0·024; figure 1; appendix p 11).
Modification by weight of the effect of low-dose aspirin 
on cardiovascular events remained when stratifying by 
BMI (appendix p 5), and the effect was also modified by 
height (appendix p 12). Effect modification was similar 
for body surface area, lean body mass, and fat mass, but 
bodyweight was most informative (appendix pp 13, 14). 
When modelled together, effect modification by weight 
(pinteraction=0·0026) and smoking (pinteraction=0·0027) exceeded 
that by BMI (pinteraction=0·30).
In secondary prevention of stroke in the ESPS-2 trial,28 
aspirin (25 mg twice daily vs placebo) reduced cardio-
vascular events in participants weighing less than 70 kg 
(HR 0·74 [95% CI 0·63–0·87], p=0·0003; appendix p 15). 
Some benefit was also evident in participants weighing 
70 kg or more, but only in the acute phase of treatment

(appendix p 15). Effect modification by weight during all 
follow-up of that trial was similar to that in the primary 
prevention trials of 75–100 mg aspirin, particularly in 
women (HR for cardiovascular events or death was 0·68 
[95% CI 0·56–0·83, p=0·0001] in women weighing 
<70 kg and 1·02 [0·77–1·35, p=0·90] in those weighing 
≥70 kg; pinteraction=0·022; figure 2; appendix p 15). However, 
benefit was also seen in women who weighed less than 
50 kg (HR 0·50 [95% CI 0·29–0·84, p=0·0094] for all 
cardiovascular events or death; appendix p 15). In the 
Dutch-TIA trial (aspirin 30 mg vs 283 mg),31 30 mg aspirin 
also tended to be more effective than 283 mg in women 
weighing less than 70 kg (23 of 253 women treated with 
30 mg had a cardiovascular event vs 47 of 319 women 
treated with 283 mg), although the difference was not 
significant (HR 0·64 [95% CI 0·39–1·06], p=0·081). 
Higher-dose aspirin
The ability of higher doses of aspirin (300–325 mg 
or 500 mg) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events 
in primary prevention trials increased with weight 
(pinteraction=0·017), with consistent findings for cardiovascular 
events or death (pinteraction=0·0087) and in primary and 
secondary prevention trials combined (pinteraction=0·0050; 
figure 3; appendix pp 16, 17). In primary prevention, 
325 mg aspirin reduced cardiovascular events in 
participants weighing 70 kg or more (HR 0·83 [95% CI 
0·70–0·98], p=0·028) and 500 mg aspirin reduced 
cardiovascular events (0·55 [0·28–1·09], p=0·086) and 
cardiovascular events or death (0·52 [0·30–0·89], p=0·017) 
in participants weighing 90 kg or more (appendix p 15). 
These results were consistent in a pooled analysis of all 
trials: cardiovascular events were reduced in participants 
weighing 70 kg or more (0·79 [0·70–0·90], p=0·0005) with 
300–325 mg aspirin and in those weighing 90 kg or more 
(0·45 [0·26–0·79], p=0·0050) with 500 mg or more. The 
excess of major bleeding on aspirin tended to increase 
with weight (pinteraction=0·087; appendix p 18).
The direction of the effect modification by weight for 
higher doses of aspirin differed from that for lower doses 
(difference pinteraction=0·0013 for cardiovascular events in 
primary prevention trials; figure 4), and a data-derived 
schedule for more optimal, weight-dependent dosing 
(75–100 mg for people weighing 50–69 kg, 300–325 mg for 
those weighing 70–89 kg, and ≥500 mg for those weighing 
≥90 kg) suggested that primary prevention might be 
improved for cardiovascular events (pinteraction=0·0005), 
stroke (pinteraction=0·0031), cardiovascular-related death 
(pinteraction=0·0014), and all-cause death (pinteraction=0·0019; 
appendix p 19). The direction of the effect modification by 
height also differed for higher doses versus lower doses of 
aspirin (difference pinteraction=0·0025 for cardiovascular 
events in primary prevention trials; figure 4), particularly 
in the tallest quintile (appendix p 12).
Risk of sudden cardiac death in trials of aspirin in 
primary prevention was increased when the dose of 
aspirin exceeded that in the data-derived schedule for 
weight-dependent dosing (HRs were 2·03 [95% CI 
1·31–3·15, p=0·0015] for all doses, 2·13 [0·88–5·19] for 
75–100 mg at <50 kg, 1·99 [0·80–4·93] for 325 mg 
at <70 kg, and 2·26 [1·18–4·34] for 500 mg at <90 kg). By 
contrast, risk of sudden cardiac death was not increased 
at weight above those thresholds (HR 0·96 [95% CI 
0·80–1·14], p=0·62; pinteraction=0·0018; appendix p 12).
Effects on cancer risk
In the five primary prevention trials15–19 with post-
trial follow-up and data on weight (including 
73 372 participants), the reduction in 20-year risk of 
colorectal cancer (1217 cases) with aspirin was lost at 
higher bodyweight (pinteraction=0·038; figure 5). Low-dose 
aspirin (75–100 mg) reduced risk of colorectal cancer in 
participants weighing less than 70 kg (HR 0·64 [95% CI 
0·50–0·82], p=0·0004) but not in people weighing 
70 kg or more (0·87 [0·71–1·07], p=0·32). By contrast, 
benefit from higher doses of aspirin (≥325 mg) extended 
to participants weighing up to 80 kg (0·69 [0·55–0·87, 
p=0·0014] for participants weighing <80 kg vs 1·08 
[0·83–1·39] for participants weighing ≥80 kg).

Data on in-trial occurrence of cancer were available 
from all ten eligible trials of aspirin versus placebo in 
primary prevention.15–20,24–27 Aspirin had no effect on overall 
number of cancer-related deaths (986 treated with aspirin vs 
1039 treated with control; HR 0·95 [95% CI 0·87–1·04], 
p=0·28), but did reduce cancer-related deaths after 5 years 
of follow-up in participants weighing less than 70 kg 
(appendix p 20).
Aspirin had no effect on the overall incidence of first 
cancer (3484 treated with aspirin vs 3448 treated with 
control; HR 1·01 [95% CI 0·96–1·06], p=0·64). However, 
aspirin appeared to increase cancer incidence in part-
icipants aged 70 years or older in the first 3 years of 
follow-up (1·20 [1·03–1·47], p=0·02), reflecting an 
apparent age-related hazard (pinteraction=0·043; figure 6A). 
This increased risk in individuals aged 70 years or older 
was greatest in those of smaller body size (pinteraction=0·034 
for weight; pinteraction=0·095 for height; appendix pp 21, 22), 
particularly in those weighing less than 70 kg (table 3) 
and, consequently, in women (143 women aged ≥70 years 
who were treated with aspirin had a first cancer 
within 3 years of follow-up vs 99 treated with control; 
HR 1·44 [95% CI 1·11–1·87], p=0·0069).
The increased 3-year risk of cancer with aspirin in 
participants aged 70 years or older and weighing less 
than 70 kg was followed by a reduced incidence of cancer 
after 5 years in the analyses of all trials (appendix p 20). 
Figure 6 shows the time-course of risk of cancer in 
participants who were below the same dose–weight 
thresholds observed for the effect of aspirin on long-term 
risk of colorectal cancer (effective at <70 kg for 75–100 mg 
and <80 kg for ≥300 mg) and similar height thresholds 
(effective at <1·6 m for 75–100 mg and <1·8 m for 
≥300 mg). Cancers increased by aspirin in participants 
below these thresholds were lower oesophageal or 
stomach cancer and colorectal cancer (weight below 
threshold: 83 vs 53; HR 1·48 [95% CI 1·05–2·09], 
p=0·027; height below threshold: 69 vs 33; 1·94, 
[1·27–2·96], p=0·0022).
The overall in-trial cancer incidence was increased by 
aspirin in people with diabetes who weighed less than 
70 kg (table 3), with a similar hazard in those with 
diabetes who were 1·6 m or shorter, resulting in an 
increase in overall incidence in women with diabetes but 
not in men (appendix p 23). Risk of cancer was 
particularly high in women with diabetes who were 
younger than 50 years at baseline (28 of 1285 treated with 
aspirin vs six of 1283 treated with control; HR 4·35 
[95% CI 1·80–10·5], p=0·0011), partly due to an increase 
in breast cancers, which was seen up to age 65 years 
(34 vs 13; 2·60 [1·13–2·57], p=0·012).
Discussion
Suboptimal inhibition of thromboxane production has 
been shown with daily, low-dose aspirin in association 
with diabetes and obesity or high bodyweight.5–7,33 Our 
findings that the clinical effectiveness of low-dose aspirin 
is reduced in people of greater weight and height, and 
that this association is reversed with higher doses, 
suggest the existence of a therapeutic window related to 
body size within which a given daily dose is most 
effective. Specifically, loss of efficacy can occur if the 
aspirin dose is too low or too high for body size, and 
other harms appear to result from excess dosing. 
Reductions in cardiovascular events and all-cause death 
at optimal doses for weight were substantial, highlighting 
the potential of more tailored aspirin dosing.
That low-dose aspirin at higher body size did not 
reduce cardiovascular events was consistent for daily 
and alternate-day dosing (figure 1), for all subgroups 
studied (appendix p 5), for early versus later follow-
up (appendix pp 6, 7), for fatal cardiovascular events 
(appendix p 10), and for on-treatment analyses 
(appendix p 6). Loss of effect at larger body size, driven 
more by weight and height than by BMI, suggests 
insufficient systemic bioavailability of aspirin rather 
than increased platelet activation secondary to obesity. 
Acetylation of platelet COX-1 in the portal circulation 
alone might not fully account for the effect of aspirin

some systemic bio 
availability might be required to 
inhibit COX-1 in megakariocytes,7 partially inhibit 
extra-platelet COX,34 or increase endothelial nitric oxide 
formation.35,36 The bioavailability hypothesis is also 
supported by the somewhat greater loss of effect with 
enteric-coated or delayed-release aspirin than with daily 
standard-release aspirin in individuals weighing 70 kg 
or more (appendix p 9). However, the additional 
independent effect of smoking suggests that increased 
platelet activation also undermines low-dose aspirin, 
particularly with alternate-day dosing and in individuals 
with diabetes (table 2).
Weight-based dosing is commonly used for thrombo-
lytics and intravenous antiplatelet treatment, but not for 
oral antiplatelet drugs. Our findings, therefore, have 
implications for practice. First, given that low-dose aspirin 
reduces cardiovascular events to a greater ex 
tent than 
previously thought in individuals weighing 50–69 kg, 
comparisons with other antiplatelet or anti 
thrombotic 
regimens should be stratified by body size. Second, 
interactions between dose and weight probably explain 
previously reported sex differences in the effects of 
aspirin on risks of stroke and myocardial infarction,9,10 
which might not be explained by overweight or obesity 
alone. Third, that 75–100 mg aspirin was ineffective in 
primary prevention of cardiovascular events in the 80% of 
men and nearly 50% of women who weighed 70 kg or 
more in our study, even increasing the case fatality of first 
events, questions the use of once-daily low doses of 
aspirin irrespective of weight, particularly in people who 
smoke or are taking enteric-coated aspirin. More data 
on the weight dependence of the effects of standard-
release, low-dose aspirin would be helpful, but in larger 
individuals, any advantage of enteric coating in reducing 
upper-gastrointestinal tract side-effects must be weighed 
against the loss of effect on cardiovascular events. Fourth, 
no trial of 75–100 mg aspirin versus placebo was available 
in the setting of secondary prevention of stroke or 
myocardial infarction (records were destroyed37 or weight 
or height were not recorded32). However because loss of 
effectiveness in primary prevention of stroke or myo-
cardial infarction in participants weighing 70 kg or more 
was most evident at older ages, in people who smoked, 
and in people with diabetes (appendix p 5), similar 
findings are likely in long-term secondary prevention. 
Moreover, analyses of trials comparing antiplatelet 
regimens in secondary prevention of stroke show that 
dual antiplatelet treat 
ment is more effective than low-
dose aspirin alone in people weighing 70 kg or more 
(Rothwell, unpublished), further implying that platelet 
inhibition is suboptimal at higher weight. Inadequate 
inhibition might explain the paradoxically increased case 
fatality of cardiovascular events in people of higher 
weight who are on low-dose aspirin, particularly if 
COX-independent pathways are upregulated. Fifth, 
guidelines to target individuals at high predicted risk of 
vascular events (eg, people who are overweight and 
smoke) for primary prevention with low-dose aspirin 
might not yield benefits. Sixth, widespread use of 325 mg 
aspirin once a day in the USA, and elsewhere, is 
questionable in low-weight individuals given the 
effectiveness of lower doses and the apparent hazards of

excess dosing. Seventh, the possible harm of 75–100 mg 
aspirin in individuals weighing less than 50 kg will be 
most relevant in Japan and in parts of Asia where 
bodyweight is often less than 50 kg in women. The effects 
of 25–30 mg aspirin twice a day in the ESPS-2 trial 
(figure 2) suggest that lower doses might be preferable for 
such women. The mechanism of harm from aspirin at 
very low bodyweight is uncertain, but systemic effects on 
underlying non-vascular dis 
ease might be relevant, 
particularly in those who are underweight. Finally, our 
findings might inform inter 
pretation of trials of dual 
therapy with aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitors after coronary 
events. Previous trials38,39 invest 
igating this combination 
reported that the effects of irreversible inhibitors, such as 
clopidogrel and prasugrel, appeared to be more weight 
dependent than those of the reversible P2Y12 inhibitor 
(ticagrelor), possibly because of twice-daily dosing, and 
that the efficacy of clopidogrel versus ticagrelor when 
added to aspirin might depend on both aspirin dose and 
bodyweight.
We found that the effect of 75–100 mg aspirin on major 
bleeding was not lost until weight exceeded 90 kg. A 90 kg 
threshold was also found for reduced major bleeding on 
long-term treatment with 75 mg aspirin in a population-
based cohort (OR for people weighing ≥90 kg was 0·58 
[95% CI 0·36–0·84, p=0·002; Rothwell, unpublished).40 By 
contrast, we found that excess bleeding on high-dose 
aspirin did not diminish above 90 kg (appendix p 18), but 
appeared to increase with weight, similar to the effect on 
vascular events.
The effect of aspirin on long-term risk of colorectal 
cancer provided more evidence of interactions between 
dose and weight, with loss of effect for both vascular 
events and cancer with 75–100 mg aspirin in individuals 
weighing 70 kg or more. However, neither the loss of 
effect of higher-dose aspirin on risk of colorectal cancer 
in individuals weighing 80 kg or more nor the reduction 
in risk at lower weight was consistent with the effects on 
vascular events, and so the mechanisms of weight 
dependence might differ, possibly being more related to 
BMI than to lean bodyweight.
We confirmed that aspirin reduced the risk of in-trial 
death from cancer after 5 years’ follow-up,41 but only in 
individuals weighing less than 70 kg, and stratification by 
body size identified other effects on short-term cancer 
risk. Possible increases in early risk of colorectal cancer 
and stomach cancers on high-dose aspirin have been 
noted previously,13,21 but our findings in a much larger 
patient population suggest that low-dose aspirin might 
accelerate growth of some existing cancers at lower body 
size, particularly at older ages. The increased early risk 
should not necessarily be dismissed as simply an artifact 
of earlier diagnosis resulting from bleeding on aspirin. 
Although no increase in total cancers was observed 
during trial follow-up, there was no compensatory 
reduction in in-trial deaths from cancer at older ages 
that might result from earlier diagnosis, and neither the 
dependence of effects on body size nor the apparent 
increase in breast cancer in people with diabetes 
suggested a bleeding artifact. An adverse effect of 
salicylate, perhaps exacerbated at older ages because of 
reduced renal clearance of metabolites, could increase 
cancer growth.42 Furthermore, effects in people with 
diabetes might implicate insulin-related metabolic 
pathways and growth factors, or effects on extra-platelet 
COX.34 However, the findings first need to be confirmed 
or refuted in forthcoming trials. No increase in cancer 
risk was evident on 25 mg aspirin twice a day in the 
ESPS-2 trial (Rothwell, unpublished),28 and analyses of 
trials of other antiplatelet drugs are ongoing (Rothwell, 
unpublished).
The increased risk of sudden cardiac death on higher-
dose aspirin was reported in some early trials,43 but was 
inconsistent,44 and there has been no systematic study or 
stratification by dose or body size. The suggestion of 
increased risk at lower bodyweight in people receiving 
75–100 mg aspirin might be consistent with the increased 
risk of silent myocardial infarction in participants receiving 
75 mg aspirin in the HOT trial,24 although our analysis was 
based on a small sample size and should be interpreted 
with caution. The fact that the hazard was mainly confined 
to use of higher-dose aspirin at lower body size might 
again be consistent with systemic COX-2 inhibition by 
aspirin, or possibly with other effects of salicylate.

Further research is required to validate and extend 
our findings. Three trials of low-dose aspirin in primary 
prevention, due to report in 2018, are studying groups in 
which we found effect modification by weight, including 
patients with diabetes (ASCEND; NCT00135226), people 
aged 70 years or older (ASPREE; NCT01038583), and 
people at increased vascular risk (ARRIVE; NCT00501059). 
Weight-stratified analyses of cardio 
vascular events are 
planned for the ARRIVE trial (NCT00501059) and also 
the JPPP trial27 (Rothwell, unpublished). Trials of twice-
daily dosing are also required,45,46 and some are ongoing 
(eg, ANDAMAN; NCT0252092). If lack of systemic 
bioavailability of daily aspirin undermines clinical 
effectiveness simply because the lack of inhibition of 
COX-1 in megakariocytes allows continued production of 
new uninhibited platelets, then effectiveness should be 
improved by more frequent dosing to inhibit these new 
platelets in the portal venous circulation, without the 
need for much higher doses. Our analysis of the ESPS-2 
trial showed that 25 mg aspirin twice a day was highly 
effective in individuals weighing less than 70 kg (figure 2), 
and 50–100 mg twice a day might be effective in heavier 
individuals. Use of a low dose of aspirin twice a day might 
also reduce any hazards resulting from excess dosing. 
Trials (eg, ADAPTABLE; NCT02697916) of low versus 
higher doses of aspirin given once a day might be helpful 
if stratified by body size, but are otherwise still testing 
a one-dose-fits-all strategy. Future trials might study 
weight-dependent dosing. Previous trials of aspirin use 
in the short term to treat acute vascular events should 
be analysed to establish any weight dependence of 
acute effects, which might differ in the acute phase 
because of a reduced likelihood of missed doses. Trials 
of other antiplatelet drugs versus aspirin in longer-term 
prevention should also be assessed, although results 
might be complicated by weight-related dosing issues 
with some of these drugs.
Although our findings of dose–weight interactions in 
the effects of aspirin were consistent across trials and 
for vascular events and cancer, this study has some 
limitations. First, we included some older trials, and 
temporal changes in risk factors or medication could 
alter findings. However, low-dose, enteric-coated aspirin 
is widely used in clinical practice and was used in the 
three forthcoming primary prevention trials (ASPREE, 
ARRIVE, and ASCEND), so our main findings are likely 
to be relevant. Second, only one primary prevention 
trial24 used standard-release, low-dose aspirin, and no 
data were available from similar trials in secondary 
prevention;32,37 thus, investigation of the weight depen-
dence of the effect of standard-release, low-dose aspirin 
was inexact (appendix p 9). However, the aspirin

component of the twice-daily tablet used in the ESPS-2 
trial was standard release (figure 2). Third, some trials 
were only in men and some only in women, but we did 
analyses in both sexes separately when possible. Fourth, 
we validated findings in trials in secondary prevention of 
stroke and cannot be certain of the generalisability of the 
results to other secondary prevention settings. We also 
had no data on the different subtypes of ischaemic stroke. 
Atrial fibrillation is associated with greater height but 
was an exclusion criterion in the primary prevention 
trials, and onset of atrial fibrillation during follow-up 
would only account for a small proportion of strokes. 
Fifth, bodyweight might have changed during trial 
follow-up, although height is more stable than weight. 
Sixth, although we excluded con 
founding by withdrawal 
from randomised treatment (appendix p 6), we had no 
additional data on levels of compliance. It is possible that 
missed doses might particularly undermine effectiveness 
at larger body size. Seventh, optimal weight or height 
clearly differed for low-dose versus higher-dose aspirin, 
but differences between 300–325 mg and 500 mg or 
more could not be reliably ascertained, and no trials were 
available of doses between 100 mg and 300 mg. Eighth, 
body-fat distribution might modify the effect of aspirin to 
a greater extent than does BMI but is unlikely to 
confound the effect modification found for height and 
lean body mass. Finally, we did not aim to estimate the 
current overall balance of risk and benefit from aspirin 
given that several of the trials were done more than 
20 years ago.
In conclusion, the optimal dose of aspirin to prevent 
cardiovascular events depends on bodyweight, driven 
more by lean body mass and height than by BMI. Low-
dose (75–100 mg) aspirin once a day was ineffective in 
people weighing 70 kg or more, particularly in those who 
smoked or were treated with enteric-coated formulations, 
whereas higher doses became more effective with 
increasing weight. Given that the effects on sudden 
cardiac death and cancer also showed dose–weight 
interactions, the one-dose-fits-all strategy for daily aspirin 
use is unlikely to be optimal. The substantial reductions 
in cardiovascular events and death at optimal doses for 
weight highlight the potential to improve effectiveness 
and argue for a more tailored dosing strategy.
