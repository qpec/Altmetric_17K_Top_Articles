Major depressive disorder is associated with abnormalities in the brain and the immune
system. Chronic stress in animals showed that epigenetic and inflammatory mechanisms play
important roles in mediating resilience and susceptibility to depression. Here, through a high-
throughput screening, we identify two phytochemicals, dihydrocaffeic acid (DHCA) and
malvidin-3′-O-glucoside (Mal-gluc) that are effective in promoting resilience against stress
by modulating brain synaptic plasticity and peripheral inflammation. DHCA/Mal-gluc also
significantly reduces depression-like phenotypes in a mouse model of increased systemic
inflammation induced by transplantation of hematopoietic progenitor cells from stress-
susceptible mice. DHCA reduces pro-inflammatory interleukin 6 (IL-6) generations by inhi-
biting DNA methylation at the CpG-rich IL-6 sequences introns 1 and 3, while Mal-gluc
modulates synaptic plasticity by increasing histone acetylation of the regulatory sequences of
the Rac1 gene. Peripheral inflammation and synaptic maladaptation are in line with newly
hypothesized clinical intervention targets for depression that are not addressed by currently
available antidepressants.

urrently available treatments for major depressive disorder
(MDD) mainly target neurochemical or neurobiological
mechanisms1. Conventional pharmacological treatments
produce temporary remission in <50% of patients2, 3. Thus, there
is an urgent need for a wider spectrum of novel therapeutics to
target newly discovered underlying disease mechanisms.
Depression is associated with a multitude of pathological
processes. Peripheral inflammation and synaptic abnormalities
are thought to directly or indirectly induce brain functional
abnormalities contributing to depression4–8. Patients with MDD
display neuronal atrophy and reduced brain volume in regions
including the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, ventral
striatum, and thalamus. Post-mortem brain transcriptomic stu-
dies of MDD subjects identified alterations in the expression of
genes important for synaptic functions9,
10. Stress-induced
abnormalities in synaptic remodeling are also observed in ani-
mal models of stress11–14. We previously found that both in
humans and in rodents, chronic stress reduces RAS-related C3
botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) expression in the NAc and
this downregulation is associated with repressive chromatin state
surrounding its proximal promoter region11. Rac1 plays an
important role in regulating dendritic spines and excitatory
synapses15–17. In psychiatric disorders, Rac1-mediated spine
morphological changes may contribute to pathological structural
and functional changes of the brain18, 19. Pharmacological inhi-
bition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) not only normalizes Rac1
transcription but also rescues depression-like behavior11. These
studies suggest Rac1-mediated synaptic remodeling in the NAc,
and associated epigenetic changes, can be potential targets for
depressive disorders.
In addition to the central nervous system (CNS), the con-
tribution of peripheral inflammation to depression has received
increasing attention. Many neuroimmune factors have been
implicated in depressive disorders, however, studies in humans
suggest that elevated expression of peripheral interleukin 6 (IL-6)
is most consistently observed20, 21. IL-6 is a proinflammatory
cytokine and the mechanism(s) by which peripheral IL-6 may
modulate depression phenotypes are under intense investigation.
Current evidence suggests that IL-6 is capable of crossing the
blood–brain barrier (BBB) and may alter neuroplasticity by acting
directly on neurons or indirectly through modulation of microglia
and/or other CNS immune cells22. This is supported by the
observation
that
intracranial
infusion
of
IL-6
increases
depression-associated behavior23. These studies suggest that
modulations of IL-6 and associated immune signaling pathways
may provide novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and/or treat
depression.
In spite of the important roles of inflammation and brain
synaptic remodeling in the pathogenesis of depression, currently
available antidepressants do not specifically address MDD-
associated inflammation and synaptic maladaptation. Poly-
phenols have shown some efficacy in modulating aspects of
depression; however, the mechanisms of action are largely
unknown24. We recently identified a bioactive dietary polyphenol
preparation (BDPP), composed of Concord grape juice, grape
seed extract and trans-resveratrol, that is effective in protecting
against diverse mechanisms associated with multiple neurological
disorders25–29. Here we test the efficacy of BDPP and two novel
phytochemicals derived from post-absorptive and microbiome
metabolism of BDPP in attenuating depression by reversing
stress-mediated brain synaptic maladaptation through modula-
tion of peripheral IL-6 and Rac1 in the NAc. The study provides
preclinical evidence supporting simultaneously targeting novel
key disease mechanisms through epigenetic modification as a
novel intervention for depression.
Results
Treatment with BDPP promotes resilience to social stress. To
test the efficacy of BDPP in promoting resilience in stress-
mediated depression, we treated C57BL/6 male mice with BDPP
or vehicle for 2 weeks prior to and throughout RSDS and then
performed social avoidance/interaction (SI) testing (Fig. 1a).
Treatment with BDPP significantly increased the proportion of
mice resilient to stress as indicated by increased social interac-
tions compared to the vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 1b, c). Overall,
over 70% of mice receiving BDPP showed a resilient behavioral
phenotype, whereas <40% were resilient in the vehicle control
group.
IL-6 and Rac1 modulate synaptic plasticity. Evidence garnered
from the RSDS model indicates the novel roles of IL-6 and Rac1
as contributing factors to depression phenotypes11, 30. Recent
studies demonstrate that increased glutamatergic transmission on
ventral striatum medium spiny neurons (MSNs) mediates stress-
induced
susceptibility
following
RSDS31,

 investigated the biological roles of IL-6 and Rac1 on glutamatergic
synapses. To test the effect of peripheral IL-6 on synaptic plasticity
in the NAc, we generated bone marrow (BM) transplanted chi-
meras using BM from wild type (WT) or IL-6 knockout mice (IL-
6−/−). Following transplantation and recovery, chimeras were
exposed to RSDS and the density of PSD-95, a postsynaptic
marker of excitatory synapses, was measured in the NAc. RSDS
induced a robust increase of PSD-95 puncta in WT BM chimeras
compared to unstressed WT or IL-6−/− BM chimeras, while no
increase of PSD-95 puncta was observed in stressed IL-6−/− BM
chimeras (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Whether stress-induced IL-6-
mediated up-regulation of PSD95 in the NAc is specific to select
cell types (e.g., Drd1 or Drd2 medium spiny neurons, or inter-
neurons) needs further characterization. Measurements of circu-
lating IL-6 revealed that IL-6 was significantly higher in WT
chimeras compared to IL-6−/− BM chimeras following RSDS
(Supplementary Fig. 1b). The level in stressed IL-6−/− BM chi-
meras was comparable to that of non-stressed WT chimera,
suggesting leukocytes are the main source of circulating IL-6 and
alternative sources may only make minor contributions to stress-
induced IL-6 increase. Previous studies showed that Rac1
decreases excitatory spine density on MSNs and attenuates RSDS-
induced susceptibility11. We found that exogenous expression of
Rac1 in MSN-enriched primary cultures significantly reduced the
expression of PSD-95 and vesicular glutamate transporter 2
(vGlut2) while having no effects on GABAergic vesicular GABA
transporter (VGAT) (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Collectively, these
data demonstrate that IL-6 and Rac1 can each modulate synaptic
plasticity in neurons from NAc, supporting these mechanisms as
targets for stress-induced depression (Supplementary Fig. 1d).
In vitro screening for IL-6 inhibition and Rac1 promotion.
BDPP contains a variety of polyphenols. Orally consumed poly-
phenols are typically bioavailable in various organs and tissues as
metabolites (phase II polyphenol conjugates and phenolic acids)
following xenobiotic metabolism and gastrointestinal microbiome
fermentation. It is possible that some metabolites may counteract
the positive effect of the others. Therefore, if supplied as BDPP,
the overall benefits might be reduced due to potential ‘cancella-
tion’ effects. By identifying individual metabolites that selectively
target key pathological mechanisms (e.g., Rac1 and IL-6) we can
greatly improve the efficacy. We and others recently identified 21
BDPP-derived phenolic metabolites that accumulate in blood
and/or in the CNS (14 polyphenolic metabolites and 7 phenolic
acids, Supplementary Table 1)25, 28, 33, among which 14 are
currently accessible28, 34. We initiated a high-throughput screen
of these metabolites for their ability to modulate IL-6 and Rac1.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from
C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with plasma bioavailable meta-
bolites (Supplementary Table 1) for 16 h followed by stimulation
with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 16 h. We found that 3(3,4-
dihydroxy-phenyl) propionic acid (DHCA) was the most effective
in reducing LPS-induced IL-6 production (Fig. 2a) with a cal-
culated IC50 of 17.69 µM (Fig. 2b). In parallel studies, we
screened 9 brain bioavailable metabolites using E18 MSN-
enriched primary culture. We found that malvidin-3′-O-gluco-
side (Mal-gluc) significantly increased Rac1 expression (Fig. 2c)
with a calculated EC50 of 3.52 nM (Fig. 2d). Among all the
metabolites currently available for screening, we did not find any
compounds that can simultaneously reduce IL-6 in PBMCs and
increase Rac1 in primary MSN-enriched cultures.
DHCA modulates intronic CpG methylation of IL-6. To
investigate how DHCA may attenuate IL-6 generation, we tested
the effect of DHCA on Toll-like receptor-4 mediated signaling
pathways. PBMCs were pretreated with DHCA and stimulated
with LPS using the same protocol as during screening. Samples
were taken at 0, 30 min, 60 min, 6 h and 16 h following LPS sti-
mulation and cell lysates were subjected to a multiplex ELISA
assay. We found that DHCA had no effect on the activation of
JNK or p38 as reflected by the lack of changes in phosphorylation
of these molecules at any time points (Supplementary Figs. 2a and
b). DHCA treatment produced a ~10% decrease in ERK and AKT
activation 30 min and 60 min following LPS stimulation but no
further changes were observed at 6 h and 16 h (Supplementary
Figs. 2c and d). Based on evidence that DNA methylation at a
single CpG in the human IL-6 promoter region effectively alters
IL-6 expression35, we next tested whether DHCA can modulate
IL-6 gene expression through methylation mechanisms. We
treated PBMC cells with DHCA and measured the expression of
enzymes essential for DNA methylation/demethylation. We
found DHCA treatment significantly reduced the expression of
the DNA-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), an enzyme that plays a
key role in methylation maintenance and also in de novo
methylation processes (Fig. 2e). To investigate how methylation
influences IL-6 gene expression, we employed the CpG-free
luciferase reporter system. We cloned a ~280 bp CpG rich DNA
segment from the mouse IL-6 promoter into a promoterless CpG-
free reporter construct and transfected into N2a cells. We found
the CpG-rich IL-6 promoter segment presented no inherent
promoter activity as reflected by no differences in luciferase
activity compared to the control construct (Fig. 2f). Moreover,
treatment
with
5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine
(AZA-DC,
a
DNA
methylation inhibitor) had no effect on the expression of luci-
ferase (Fig. 2f), confirming methylation does not play any role in
IL-6 promoter activity. We then cloned CpG rich DNA segments
from IL-6 introns 1, 3 or 4 into the CpG-free luciferase reporter
construct with a minimal EF1 promoter and no enhancer activity.
Transfection of EF1-luciferase reporter constructs containing IL-6
intron 1 or intron 3 CpG-rich DNA segments significantly
increased the luciferase activity, indicating both intronic 1 and 3
CpG-rich sequences present inherent enhancer activity (Fig. 2g).
AZA-DC treatment partially reduced luciferase activity of intron
1 and totally abolished the enhancer activity of intron 3,
demonstrating the contributions of intron 1 and intron 3
methylation on IL-6 transcription activity (Fig. 2g). Similar to
AZA-DC, DHCA treatment also partially attenuated the enhan-
cer activity of intron 1 and totally abolished the enhancer activity
of intron 3 (Fig. 2g), suggesting DHCA has inhibitory activity on
DNA methylation. In contrast, the CpG-rich region of IL-6 intron
4 presented no observable enhancer activity (Fig. 2g). These data
suggest that DNA methylation at the CpG-rich sequences of IL-6
introns 1 and 3 can influence IL-6 expression and DHCA func-
tions similar to a DNA methylation inhibitor that can reduce
intronic DNA methylation to lead to attenuated IL-6 expression.
To test whether DHCA may influence the expression of other
pro-inflammatory factors, we measured the level of secreted
cytokines following LPS stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Besides IL-6, DHCA significantly reduced LPS-induced produc-
tion of cytokines, mostly of pro-inflammatory nature, including
granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF),
IL-1β, IL-12 p40 and p70, IL-17 and MCP-1 (Supplementary
Fig. 3) while in the absence LPS stimulation, DHCA did not
influence cytokine expression profile.
Mal-gluc increases acetylation of Rac1 gene promoter region.
Stress-induced reduction of Rac1 expression is associated with a
repressed chromatin state surrounding the promoter region of Rac1
in the NAc11. Since Mal-gluc can cross the BBB, we hypothesized
that Mal-gluc may promote Rac1 expression, in part, by modulating

 chromatin acetylation. We first assessed the effect of Mal-gluc on
HDACs that play key roles in chromatin deacetylation. Treatment
of MSN-enriched primary cultures with Mal-gluc significantly
reduced the expression of HDAC2, but had no observable effect on
other class I or class II HDACs (Fig. 2h). Using site directed
quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (qCHIP), we exam-
ined the permissive histone H3 acetylation (AcH3) in Mal-gluc
treated MSN-enriched primary cultures. Compared to vehicle, Mal-
gluc significantly increased permissive acetylation of Rac1 across the
region surveyed (Fig. 2i) while having no effect on the repressive
trimethylation of the Rac1 promoter (Fig. 2j). Consistent with this
observation, Mal-gluc treatment did not affect the expression of
enzymes involved in de novo methylation and demethylation
process (Supplementary Fig. 4).
In vivo safety and dose finding. We then initiated dose response
and safety studies in mice to determine testing dosages and safety
of DHCA and Mal-gluc. C57BL/6 mice were treated with either
DHCA (doses ranging from 50 µg to 50 mg/kg-BW/day) or Mal-
gluc (doses ranging from 50 ng to 5 mg/kg-BW/day) for 2 weeks
to simulate long-term administration. Mice treated with DHCA
were challenged with intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 0.4 mg/kg-
BW LPS and plasma levels of IL-6 were measured 6 h post
injection. Pretreatment with DHCA led to a dose-dependent
suppression of IL-6 and that the groups treated with 5 and 50 mg/
kg-BW/day showed the most significant reductions (Fig. 3a). In
parallel, we measured Rac1 mRNA in the NAc of animals treated
with Mal-gluc by real-time PCR and found a dose-response
increase of Rac1 expression with 500 ng/kg-BW/day and 5 µg/kg-
BW/day having the strongest promotion of Rac1 (Fig. 3b). Fol-
lowing common discovery-stage practices, we measured the
plasma levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate amino-
transferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) for liver
function and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) for renal function. We
found neither phytochemical induced significant changes in any
of the indexes (Supplementary Fig. 5).

 Prophylactic treatment of DHCA/Mal-gluc promotes resilience.
Based on the dose–response studies, we chose 5 mg/kg-BW/day
DHCA and 500 ng/kg-BW/day Mal-gluc for the preclinical stu-
dies. We tested the prophylactic effect by treating mice with a
mixture of DHCA/Mal-gluc for 2 weeks prior to and throughout
RSDS (Fig. 3c). We found that RSDS vehicle group had sig-
nificantly lower SI ratios compared to unstressed mice while
RSDS mice with DHCA/Mal-gluc treatment had significantly
higher SI ratios (Fig. 3d). Following SI testing, mice were sub-
jected to a sucrose preference test to evaluate the treatment effect
on stress-induced anhedonia. We found that RSDS vehicle group
had significantly reduced sucrose consumption compared to
unstressed mice while DHCA/Mal-gluc treated RSDS mice had
sucrose consumption similar to unstressed animals measured 48
and 72 h following the SI testing (Fig. 3e). These data suggest that
DHCA/Mal-gluc treatment can prophylactically promote resi-
lience against RSDS-induced anhedonia and social avoidance,
both of which are key symptoms of depression in humans.
We next measured the plasma level of IL-6 following the
defeat. RSDS led to a significantly higher induction of peripheral
IL-6 and that treatment with DHCA/Mal-gluc significantly
reduced plasma levels of IL-6 (Fig. 3f). Consistent with the
in vitro studies (Fig. 2e), PBMCs isolated from stressed mice with
DHCA/Mal-gluc
treatment
had
significantly
lower
mRNA
expression of both IL-6 and DNMT1 compared to vehicle-
treated stressed mice (Supplementary Fig. 6). Examination of
Rac1 expression in the NAc revealed that RSDS led to reduced
Rac1 expression compared to the unstressed mice and DHCA/
Mal-gluc treatment significantly prevented this decrease (Fig. 3g).
These studies confirmed that treatment with DHCA/Mal-gluc led
to the engagement of the intended targets.
To test whether DHCA/Mal-gluc-mediated modulation of IL-6
and Rac1 can lead to synaptic structural changes in the NAc, we
measured the number of PSD-95 puncta in the NAc shell.
Consistent with previous findings14, we found that RSDS
significantly increased the number of PSD-95 immunoreactive

 puncta compared to the vehicle-treated unstressed mice (Fig. 4a).
DHCA/Mal-gluc treatment significant reduced the number of
puncta and the level was comparable to that from unstressed mice
(Fig. 4a). To test the effect of DHCA/Mal-gluc on RSDS-induced
synaptic functional changes, we measured the miniature excita-
tory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in dopamine receptor D2
(Drd2) neurons in the NAc following RSDS using Drd2-EGFP
transgenic mice. D2 neurons were selected because RSDS
increases mEPSCs specifically on D2, but not D1 neurons in
susceptible mice32. Drd2-EGFP mice were treated with DHCA/
Mal-gluc for 2 weeks prior to and throughout the RSDS and
subjected to SI testing. As expected, DHCA/Mal-gluc treatment
significantly reduced the social avoidance phenotype (Fig. 4b).
Electrophysiology recordings of mEPSCs of D2 neurons in the
NAc shell showed that DHCA/Mal-gluc treatment significantly
reduced mEPSC frequency compared to the vehicle treatment
(Fig. 4c, d) with no difference in the mEPSC amplitude (Fig. 4e).
Collectively, these data suggest that DHCA/Mal-gluc treatment
may attenuate depression-like behavior in part through modula-
tion of MSN synaptic structure and function in the NAc.
In parallel study, we tested the effect of single target
compounds by treating mice with either 5 mg/kg-BW/day DHCA
or 500 ng/kg-BW/day Mal-gluc prior to RSDS. We found that
neither treatment significantly promoted resilience (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 7a) or alleviate anhedonia (Supplementary Fig. 7b).
These data indicate that combination treatment simultaneously
targeting Rac1 and IL-6 is necessary for preventing stress
susceptibility to RSDS.
Therapeutic treatment of DHCA/Mal-gluc attenuates depres-
sion. To test the therapeutic efficacy of DHCA/Mal-gluc, we
induced depression-like behavior using two different methods. In
the first set of studies, mice were subjected to RSDS followed by SI
test. All susceptible mice with SI ratio <0.8 were randomly
grouped into vehicle or DHCA/Mal-gluc group. Following two
weeks treatment, all mice were subjected to SI re-testing without
further stress exposure (Fig. 5a). We did not find statistical dif-
ferences in the overall SI ratio (Fig. 5b), however, we found that
25% of the vehicle group displayed a resilient phenotype upon
retesting whereas over 50% of the mice from the DHCA/Mal-guc
group became resilient (Fig. 5b). In a parallel study to compare
the treatment efficacy with the tricylic antidepressant Imipra-
mine, we treated the susceptible mice with Imipramine through i.
p. injection for 35 days. We found that about 50% of the

 susceptible mice treated with Imipramine displayed a resilient
phenotype upon retesting (Supplementary Fig. 8), suggesting that
the efficacy of DHCA/Mal-gluc is comparable to that of Imi-
pramine in treating RSDS-induced social avoidance phenotype.
We then examined the effect of DHCA/Mal-gluc on RSDS-
induced anhedonia and an ethologically relevant self-neglect
phenotype. We found the average sucrose consumption was
significantly higher in DHCA/Mal-gluc group compared to the
vehicle group (Fig. 5c). Using the splash test, a measure of stress
induced decreased self-care that is only reversible by chronic
standard antidepressant treatment36, we found that treatment
with DHCA/Mal-gluc significantly increased the time spent
grooming following aerosol delivery of a 10% sucrose solution to
the fur (Fig. 5d). We next measured the levels of IL-6 in plasma
and Rac1 in the NAc after behavioral testing. We found that
circulating IL-6 was back to baseline levels two weeks after the
defeat regardless of treatment status. This is largely consistent
with our previous studies30. We found DHCA/Mal-gluc treat-
ment significantly increased Rac1 expression in the NAc com-
pared to the vehicle-treated group (Fig. 5e) suggesting that the
therapeutic treatment indeed engages Rac1 in the NAc.
We also induced depression-like behavior in naive animals via
a BM transplant from susceptible mice as a model of enhanced
systemic inflammation30. As indicated in Fig. 5f, 4-week-old
CD45.2+ C57BL/6
recipient
mice
were
irradiated
and
reconstituted with BM hematopoietic progenitors isolated from
stress susceptible (average SI ratio of 0.46 from two mice) or
unstressed control (average SI ratio of 1.81) donors. Following 3-
week recovery, recipient mice were treated with vehicle or
DHCA/Mal-gluc for 2 weeks before being subjected to a sub-
threshold defeat stress that is not sufficient to induce social
avoidance in control BM mice11, 30. As expected, vehicle-treated
susceptible BM chimeras demonstrated increased social avoid-
ance behavior compared to CTRL chimeras following sub-
threshold defeat (Fig. 5g). Susceptible BM chimeras with DHCA/
Mal-gluc treatment had a significantly decreased social avoidance
behavior (Fig. 5g). The sucrose preference test showed that
susceptible BM chimeras had significantly lower sucrose con-
sumption compared to the CTRL chimeras and that this effect
was completely reversed by DHCA/Mal-gluc treatment (Fig. 5h).
Measurements of plasma IL-6 following sub-threshold defeat
revealed that vehicle-treated susceptible BM chimeras had
significantly higher levels of IL-6 compared to the CTRL BM
chimeras30, while treatment with DHCA/Mal-gluc significantly
lowered IL-6 levels (Fig. 5i).
To determine the level of donor chimerism, blood was
collected for flow cytometry analysis after the behavioral testing.
We found that over 90% of the viable leukocytes were derived
from the donor progenitor cells (Fig. 5j). Notably, DHCA/Mal-
gluc treatment of susceptible BM chimeras significantly inhibited

 stress-induced increases of donor-derived inflammatory Ly6Chi
monocytes and neutrophils compared to vehicle-treated suscep-
tible BM mice (Fig. 5k, l). Consistent with previous findings that
cells from stressed or non-stressed donor do not affect BM cells
reconstitution37, we found no differences in the frequency of
monocytes or neutrophils between the susceptible chimeras and
the control chimeras prior to the defeat (Supplementary Figs. 9a
and b) suggesting the increases of inflammatory monocytes and
neutrophils were triggered by the sub-threshold defeat. We then
measured the plasma levels of GM-CSF which stimulates the
proliferation and release of granulocytes and monocytes from
BM, and G-CSF, an important cytokine for the proliferation and
differentiation of neutrophils, 24 h after the sub-threshold defeat.
We found both G-CSF and GM-CSF were significantly higher in
the vehicle-treated susceptible BM chimeras compared to the
CTRL BM chimeras while DHCA/Mal-gluc treatment almost
normalized the levels of both growth factors to that of the CTRL
BM chimeras (Fig. 5m, n). These data suggest that DHCA/Mal-
gluc can attenuate stress-induced upregulation of G-CSF and
GM-CSF and subsequently the proliferation and release of
monocytes and neutrophils from BM.
DHCA/Mal-gluc treatment itself did not have any effect on
behavioral changes or circulating IL-6 in CTRL BM chimeras
following sub-threshold defeat. Neither were there any changes in
the number of inflammatory Ly6Chi monocytes or neutrophils
(Supplementary Fig. 10).
DHCA/Mal-gluc in variable stress (VS) model of depression.
RSDS is one of the best-established models for depression.
However, no single model recapitulates all aspects of human
depression. The utility and characterization of RSDS in females
are also limited. To investigate whether DHCA/Mal-gluc can
produce antidepressant responses to other stress paradigms, we
used the VS model which has been shown to induce depression-
and anxiety-like phenotypes in both male and female mice36, 38.
Male mice were treated with DHCA/Mal-gluc for 14 days and
subjected to a 21-day chronic variable stress (CVS) consisting of
alternating foot shock, tail suspension and restrain (Fig. 6a).
Following CVS, mice were subjected to a battery of behavior tests
including the splash test, novelty suppressed feeding (NSF),
forced swim test (FST), and sucrose preference test. As expected,
CVS male mice groomed significantly less when sprayed with
10% sucrose solution compared to the non-CVS mice while
DHCA/Mal-gluc treatment completely reversed CVS-induced
self-neglect behavior (Fig. 6b). NSF test was used to examine an
anxiety component of stress-induced behavior39. Stressed mice
exhibited longer latency to feed compared to the non-stressed
mice following overnight food deprivation. Notably, DHCA/Mal-
gluc treatment significantly reduced the latency to eat (Fig. 6c). In
a parallel control study, when food was provided in their home
cage, there was no difference in feeding latency (Fig. 6c, inset).
Next, FST was used to measure passive vs. active coping response.
We found CVS mice spent significantly more time immobile
compared to the non-stressed mice. Treatment with DHCA/Mal-
gluc significantly reduced the time of floating (Fig. 6d). We found
CVS did not induce anhedonia behavior using the sucrose pre-
ference test (Fig. 6e).
While 21 days of stress is necessary to induce depression-like
behavior in male mice38, female mice are more susceptible to
variable stress and express a depression-associated phenotype

 after only 6 days of stress, termed subchronic variable stress
(SCVS)36, 40. Similar to male mice, DHCA/Mal-gluc treatment
significantly reduced depression-like behavior of self-neglect and
anxiety in the splash and NSF tests (Fig. 6f, g). However, SCVS
did not induce significant passive coping behavior or anhedonia
in female mice (Fig. 6h, i).
In vitro toxicity and drug-like properties. Based on the efficacy
of DHCA/Mal-gluc in treating stress-induced depression, we
initiated an in vitro toxicity and drug-like properties studies to
investigate the potential of developing these two phytochemicals
as novel therapies. MTT assay and LDH assay showed that these
two phytochemicals have no general cytotoxicity (Table 1). At
low concentrations, DHCA and Mal-gluc had no detectable
effects on cell number, nuclear size, DNA structure, cell mem-
brane permeability, mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial mem-
brane potential or cytochrome C release in high content screening
(HCS)41 using HepG2 cells (Table 1). At high concentrations,
Mal-gluc reduced cell number, increased nuclear size, reduced cell
membrane permeability, and increased mitochondrial mass, with
calculated EC50s beyond physiological concentration (Table 1).
DHCA, at high concentrations also decreased cell membrane
permeability, increased mitochondrial mass and cytochrome C
release (Table 1). IC50 of both phytochemicals for inhibition of
the human Ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG)42 was >25 µM
(Table 1). Based on common discovery-stage cutoff criteria that
HCS cytotoxicity with EC50 > 50 μM and inhibition of hERG
with IC50 > 20 μM are acceptable, both phytochemicals are
deemed
to
possess
acceptable
cytotoxicity/cardiotoxicity
properties.
For drug-like properties, we assessed the two phytochemicals
for plasma stability43, brain stability44, plasma protein binding45
and inhibition of cytochrome P450s (CYPs) (Table 1). Common
discovery-stage cutoff criteria used for classifying individual drug-
like properties as acceptable are: T1/2 > 30 min for plasma
stability, T1/2 > 30 min for brain stability, plasma protein binding
>2% free (i.e., <98% bound fraction) and IC50 > 10 µM for any
CYP isoform. Thus, both phytochemicals are deemed to have
acceptable drug-like properties.
Monoaminergic receptor and transporter binding activities.
Currently available antidepressants are believed to act by mod-
ifying the activity of the brain monoaminergic system46, 47. We
evaluated whether Mal-gluc and DHCA directly interact with the
monoaminergic system using a radioligand binding assay. Among
the 37 receptors and transporters tested (Table 2), we found that
DHCA has no significant binding with any of them at con-
centrations as high as 10 µM (Table 2). Mal-gluc, at 10 µM con-
centration, binds weakly to 5-HT1D and 5-HT3 with a calculated
inhibitory constant (Ki) of 4.3 µM for 5-HT3 and >10 µM for 5-
HT1D, suggesting Mal-gluc does not have significant effect on the
serotonin receptors at physiological concentrations. Collectively,
these data suggest that neither phytochemical directly interacts
with receptors/transporters in the brain that are known to play
key roles in the pathogenesis of depression.
Discussion
Currently
available
antidepressant
treatments
are
mainly
designed to target the serotonergic and/or noradrenergic system
in the brain. Given the relatively low overall response rates and
the wide range of ‘adverse’ events associated with these treat-
ments, there is an urgent need for new therapeutics to treat
specific underlying disease mechanisms that are not addressed by
standard antidepressants and simultaneously treat multiple
pathogenic mechanisms to increase the likelihood of therapeutic
efficacy.
Natural products have a history of being the source for many of
the active ingredients in medications48, 49. In recent years, phy-
tochemicals have received growing interest due to their strong
antioxidant,
anti-inflammatory,
antimicrobial,
and
anti-
tumorigenic activities. Previously, we have shown that BDPP is
beneficial in various animal models of cognitive dysfunction.
However, the effect of BDPP on depression was never before
tested. Here we demonstrated that oral administration of BDPP is
effective in attenuating the development of depression-like
behaviors in a well-established RSDS model in mice. Moreover,
we identified Mal-gluc and DHCA, two bioavailable metabolites
derived from xenobiotic metabolism and gut microbiome meta-
bolism of BDPP, can prophylactically prevent as well as ther-
apeutically treat RSDS-induced depression phenotypes. Our
evidence suggests that both DHCA and Mal-gluc contribute to
resilience against the development of depression-like phenotypes
by modulating, respectively, pathological mechanisms relating to
IL-6 and Rac1. In particular, Mal-gluc significantly promotes
Rac1 expression by reducing HDAC2 expression and, thereby,
increasing histone acetylation along Rac 1 promoter and
upstream gene sequences while DHCA significantly inhibits
PBMC IL-6 expression by inhibiting DNA methylation of the IL-

 6 genes at the CpG-rich sequences of IL-6 introns 1 and 3.
Notably, besides IL-6, DHCA is also capable of modulating other
inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and IL-12, both of which
have been reported to be elevated in MDD subjects. Whether
these changes are the direct effect of DHCA or secondary to IL-6
induction, and their potential contribution to attenuate stress-
induced depression need further investigation. Epigenetic mod-
ulation of chromatin structure and subsequent gene expression
alteration following chronic stress both contribute to the patho-
genesis of stress-related disorders and depression. Previous evi-
dence demonstrated that RSDS induces a transient decrease in
cellular levels of histone H3 acetylation in the NAc and phar-
macological inhibition of HDACs or genetic manipulation of
HDAC2 leads to global normalization of stress-induced aberrant
gene expression and exerts potent anti-depressant-like effects in
behavior testing50, 51. However, the development of currently
available HDAC inhibitors for treating psychiatric disorders is
largely hindered by their lack of specificity and limited BBB
penetration. In comparison, Mal-gluc can be a promising agent
for treating depression since it is capable of penetrating across the
BBB and accumulating in the brain, and that Mal-gluc selectively
inhibits HDAC2 while sparing other classes of HDACs.
Depression is a multifaceted disease with many underlying
mechanisms. We rationalized that our approach to use a com-
bination of DHCA and Mal-gluc to simultaneously inhibit per-
ipheral inflammation and modulate synaptic plasticity in the NAc
would work synergistically to optimize resilience against chronic
stress-induced
depression-like
phenotypes
(Supplementary
Fig. 1d). Our observation is consistent with clinical and pre-
clinical evidence that overly active peripheral inflammation pro-
cesses involving inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and dis-
ruptions in the normal synaptic plasticity responses in the NAc
are two key pathological mechanisms underlying depression and
anxiety. This is further supported by our evidence that single
compound treatment is not sufficient to modulate RSDS-induced
depression-like phenotypes. While the mechanisms underlying
the interaction between peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines
and depression are largely unknown, we observed here that
selective removal of IL-6, specifically from bone marrow-derived
leukocytes, significantly blocked the stress-induced modulation of
excitatory synapses in the NAc. Our evidence demonstrated a
cause-effect
relationship
among
leukocytes-derived
proin-
flammatory responses, brain reward circuitry synaptic remodel-
ing,
and
the
manifestation
of
depression-like
behavioral
phenotypes, which supports the consideration of IL-6 and IL-6
producing
cells
(and
perhaps
additional
pro-inflammatory
molecules), as a key therapeutic target for treating depression.
This is further supported by recent findings that social defeat
stress induces neurovascular pathology and increases BBB per-
meability which may facilitate larger molecules such as IL-6 and
possibly immune cells infiltration into the CNS52. The effect of
DHCA/Mal-gluc on stress-mediated inflammation is also con-
firmed in the mouse model of increased systemic inflammation
that is induced by transplantation of hematopoietic progenitor
cells from stress-susceptible mice. Our data demonstrated that
treatment significantly attenuated depression-like phenotypes and
reduced peripheral IL-6 following sub-threshold defeat in the
chimeric mice and this was accompanied by decreased number of
circulating inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils. Previous
studies showed that both in humans and in rodents, chronic
stress induced monocytosis and neutrophilia are mediated, in
part, by increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system
involving the β3 adrenergic receptor37. However, we found that
neither DHCA nor Mal-gluc can effectively interact with β3 or
other adrenergic receptors. In contrast, we observed that DHCA/
Mal-gluc treatment significantly reduced the levels of circulating
GM-CSF and G-CSF, both are important cytokines for the pro-
liferation and migration of granulocytes and monocytes.
Sex differences in depression are well documented both in
humans and in animal models. Current depression diagnosis and
epidemiology studies showed that women are twice as likely to
develop depression as men53. However, the majority of the pre-
clinical studies in developing therapeutics have primarily used
male mice54. In this study, we tested the efficacy of DHAC/Mal-
gluc in both sexes using another well-established VS mouse
model of depression. We found that DHAC/Mal-gluc is effective
in alleviating non-social stress induced depression-like behavior
including self-neglect and anxiety in both male and female mice,
further confirming the efficacy of the treatment. We found that
21-day VS induced a passive coping response in male mice that
was reversed by the treatment while female mice exposed to a
shorter 6-day VS did not exhibit the same passive coping
response. This is consistent with experimental observation that
males and females may manifest different symptoms and
responses toward stress and further emphasizes the importance of
testing any therapeutics in both sexes.
The RSDS paradigm we used in this study leads to long-lasting
behavioral consequences in mice that recapitulate many key
behavioral features that are associated with psychosocial stress in
humans55. Similar to human psychopathology, chronic social
subordination of susceptible mice leads to a spectrum of
depression-like behaviors, among which social avoidance and

 anhedonia are most relevant to human depression. The efficacy of
DHCA/Mal-gluc in alleviating these depression-like symptoms
may also be suitable for treating other neuropsychological dis-
orders such as posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain
injury-induced mood disorder and bipolar depression, which
share similar symptoms with MDD. We demonstrated that
through mechanisms involving epigenetic modification, DHCA/
Mal-gluc can effectively target both inflammation and brain
synaptic plasticity which are not addressed by the classical
antidepressants1, 47. Our evidence supports the development of
DHCA/Mal-gluc as a novel therapeutic agent to treat patients
with treatment-resistant MDD, particularly among the majority
of patients who are characterized by high plasma levels of IL-630.
Moreover, because neither Mal-gluc nor DHCA effectively
interacts with monoaminergic systems that are targeted by clas-
sical antidepressants, DHCA/Mal-gluc can be safely used in
combination with currently available antidepressants to simulta-
neously target multiple disease mechanisms and increase the
likelihood of therapeutic success. Given the safety and drug-like
profile, and the lack of direct interaction with key molecular
components of the monoaminergic system, and the demonstrated
efficacy in both males and females in experimental model,
DHCA/Mal-gluc can immediately translate into human clinical
studies for the treatment of stress disorders and depression either
alone or in combination with currently available antidepressants.
Methods
Materials. Resveratrol (ChromaDex, Irvine, CA, USA), GSPE (Warehouse, UPC:
603573579173), CGJ (Welch), Mal-gluc, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, delphinidin-3-O-
glucoside, quercetin-3ʹ-O-glucuronide and resveratrol-3ʹ-O-glucuronide (Extra-
synthesis, Genay Cedex, France), 3-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3-(3ʹ-hydroxyphenyl)
propionic acid, homovanilic acid, DHCA, 5-(4ʹ-dydorxyphenyl) valeric acid, 3-
hydorxyphenylacetic acid, ferulic acid-4ʹ-O-sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich) were obtained
commercially and 3ʹ-O-methyl-epicatechin-5ʹ-O-glucuronide was synthesized as
previously described28, 34. All tested compounds were analyzed by LC-MS and
archived as previously reported26, 33 in compliance with NCCIH Product Integrity
guidelines.
Animals. Male CD45.2+ C57BL/6 mice were used for RSDS and as bone marrow
(BM) recipients. CD45.1+ C57BL/6 mice were used as BM donors, except for in the
IL-6−/− transplant study, which by necessity hosts were CD45.1+ C57BL/6 mice. All
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Retired breeder CD-1
mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratory. Drd2-EGFP mice were bred
and genotyped56. All animals had access to regular chow ad libitium and were
maintained on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle with lights on at 07:00 h in a temperature-
controlled (20 ± 2 °C) vivarium and all procedures were approved by the Institu-
tional Animal Care and Use Committee.
BDPP treatment. Male C57BL/6 mice (8-week-old) were randomly grouped into
two groups: one group received regular drinking water; the other group was treated
with BDPP composed of GSPE, RESV and CGJ, delivered through their drinking
water, starting 2 weeks prior to RSDS and throughout RSDS and SI testing. The
calculated daily intake of GSPE was 200 mg/kg body weight (BW), RESV was 300
mg/kg BW and CGJ was 1 ml/day.
DHCA/Mal-gluc treatment. For prophylactic treatment, 8-week-old male C57BL/
6 mice were randomly grouped into two groups: one group was treated with
vehicle, the other group was treated with a mixture of Mal-gluc (0.5 µg/kg-BW/day)
and DHCA (5 mg/kg-BW/day), delivered through their drinking water, starting
2 weeks prior to the RSDS and throughout RSDS. To facilitate the follow-up
sucrose preference test, the delivery of the drinking solution was through two 50-
ml tubes with sipper top for each cage, starting from the day of initiation of
treatment and the two tubes were regularly switched during the treatment. In
parallel control studies, mice received similar treatment but were not subjected to
RSDS. For therapeutic studies, susceptible mice (SI <0.8) were identified and
randomly grouped into two groups either treated with vehicle or DHCA/Mal-gluc
for 2 weeks. Mice were subjected to SI, sucrose preference, and splash testing. For
testing the therapeutic efficacy of Imipramine, susceptible mice were treated with
Imipramine (20 mg/kg-BW/day, i.p.) for 34 days. On day 35, mice were tested for
SI 15–20 min after the last injection.
Generation of BM chimeras and treatment. Generation of BM chimeras was
performed as previously described57. Briefly, 4-week-old recipient CD45.2+ C57BL/
6 mice were lethally irradiated with 1200 rad delivered in two doses of 600 rad each
(10–11 h apart). Following the second irradiation, BM hematopoietic cells from the
donor mice were introduced through a retro-orbital injection. BM cells were
obtained from the naive or susceptible CD45.1+ C57BL/6 mice. All mice were
treated with antibiotics (sulfatrim) for three weeks followed by two-week treatment
with vehicle or DHCA/Mal-gluc before being subjected to a sub-threshhold defeat.
In vivo safety, toxicology analyses and dose finding studies. Male C57BL/6 J
mice (8-week-old) were placed on a polyphenol-free AIN-93M diet and treated
with various doses of DHCA (vehicle, 50 µg, 500 µg, 5 mg, and 50 mg/kg-BW/day),
delivered through their drinking water for two weeks. Animals were then sacrificed
and plasma was collected for routine biochemistry panel analysis including ALP,
ALT, and AST for liver function and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) content for kidney
function. A separate group of mice was similarly treated and challenged with an i.p.
injection of 0.4 mg/kg body weight LPS and plasma was collected 6 h post injection
for IL-6 analysis. For Mal-gluc study, mice were treated with vehicle, 50 ng, 500 ng,
5 µg, 50 µg, 500 µg and 5 mg/kg-BW/day, delivered through their drinking water
for 2 weeks. Mice were sacrificed and plasma was collected for ALP, ALT, AST and
BUN analysis and NAc was isolated for gene expression analysis. For both groups
of mice, tissues were collected for pathology evaluation.
RSDS. CD-1 mice were screened for aggressive prior to the start of social defeat
experiments based on previously described criteria55, and housed in one side the
social defeat cage (26.7w × 48.3d × 15.2h cm; Allentown Inc) divided by a clear,
perforated Plexiglass divider 24 h prior to the start of defeats. Mice subjected to
RSDS were exposed to a novel CD-1 aggressor mouse for 10 min once per day, over
10 consecutive days. Following the 10 min of interaction, the experimental mice
were moved to the opposite side of the defeat cage and kept sensory contact with
CD-1 mice through the perforated divider until the next defeat. Control mice
without RSDS were housed two mice per cage, on opposite sides of the perforated
divider, rotated daily in a manner similar to the defeat group, but never exposed to
aggressive CD-1 mice. Mice were returned to a single house following the last
defeat55, 58.
Subthreshold defeat stress. C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a novel CD-1
aggressor for three consecutive 5-minutes defeat bouts, with a 15 min inter trial
interval between the defeats. Mice were subjected to social avoidance testing 24 h
after the last interaction11, 55, 58. Under control conditions, this protocol does not
result in social avoidance behavior.
Variable stress. VS was performed as described36, 40. Specifically, female mice
underwent 1 h of variable stress each day for 6 days while male mice underwent VS
for 21 days. VS consists of foot shock, tail suspension, and restraint. To prevent
habituation, stressors were administered in the following order: 100 random mild
foot shocks lasting 2 s at 0.45 mA for 1 h (Med Associates, St. Albans, Vermont,
USA); tail suspension stress for 1 h; restraint stress—mice were placed inside a 50-
ml falcon tube for 1 h within the home cage. The three stressors were then repeated
1 × for the duration of three days (for female mice) and 6 × for the duration of
18 days (for male mice) in the same order. After each stress, animals were returned
to their home cage.
Social avoidance test (Social interaction test). All social interaction (SI) tests
were performed under red-light conditions. Mice were placed in a novel interaction
open-field arena (42 × 42 × 42 cm; Nationwide Plastics) with a small animal cage
placed at one end. Their movements were automatically monitored and recorded
(Ethovision 3.0; Noldus Information Technology) for 2.5 min in the absence (target
absent phase) of a novel CD-1 mouse and followed by 2.5 min exploratory behavior
in the presence of a caged CD-1 mouse (target present phase). SI behavior was then
calculated as a ratio of the time spent in the interaction zone with the target present
divided by the time spent in the interaction zone with the target absent. All mice
with a ratio above 1.0 were classified as resilient whereas below 1.0 were classified
as susceptible55.
Splash test. Splash test was carried out in a standard mouse cage with no bedding
under a red light59. Briefly, mice were sprayed with 200 μl of a 10% (wt/vol) sucrose
solution directly onto the animal’s back using a small atomizer to induce grooming
behavior. The grooming frequency and latency were recorded for 5 min and
manually scored.
Novelty suppressed feeding (NSF). Mice were food restricted overnight before
testing. On the day of testing, mice habituated to the testing room for 1 h. Under
red light conditions, mice were then placed into a plastic box 50 × 50 × 50 cm with
bedding. A single pellet of food was placed in the center of the box. Mice were
placed in the corner of the box, and the latency to eat was scored up to 10 min
during testing. Mice were then immediately transferred to their home cage in
standard lighting conditions, and the latency to eat was recorded.

 Forced swim test (FST). FST was conducted as previously described36, 40.
Twenty-four hours after the NSF test, animals were acclimated in the test room for
an hour. Mice were then tested in a 4 liter Pyrex glass beaker, containing 2 liters of
water at 25 + 1 °C for 6 min. Behavior was videotaped and hand scored for per-
centage time spent immobile by an observer blind to experimental conditions.
Sucrose preference testing. Mice were given access to a two-bottle choice of
water or 1% sucrose solution and the consumption of each solution was recorded
once every 24 h for 48 or 72 h. The two bottles were switched following each
recording. Sucrose preference was calculated as a percentage of sucrose con-
sumption over total liquid consumption.
Electrophysiology. Male Drd2-GFP mice were perfused with ice-cold artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (mM): 128 mm NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4,
10 d-glucose, 24 NaHCO3, 2 CaCl2, and 2 MgSO4, pH 7.35 (oxygenated with 95%
O2 and 5% CO2, 295–305 mOsm). Acute brain slices containing the NAc were cut
using a microslicer (DTK-1000, Ted Pella) in sucrose-aCSF, which was derived by
fully replacing NaCl replaced by 254 sucrose60, 61. Electrophysiological recordings
were performed at 30–32 °C in aCSF containing 50 μm picrotoxin to block GABAA
receptor-mediated IPSCs and 1.5 μm tetrodotoxin to block action potentials. Patch
pipettes (3–5 MΩ resistance) were filled with an internal solution containing the
following (mM): 115 potassium gluconate, 20 KCl, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10
phosphocreatine, 2 ATP-Mg, 0.5 GTP, and 1 QX-314 [2(triethylamino)-N-(2,6-
dimethylphenyl) acetamine, a Na+ channel blocker], pH 7.2 (280–290 mOsm). The
shell of the NAc was identified under visual guidance using infrared differential
interference contrast microscopy (Olympus BX51-WI). Whole-cell voltage-clamp
recordings at a holding potential of −80 mV were performed in GFP+ cells with a
computer-controlled amplifier (MultiClamp 700B, Molecular Devices), digitized
(Digidata 1440 A, Molecular Devices), and acquired (pClamp 10.3, Molecular
Devices) at a sampling rate of 10 kHz. Only cells with resting membrane potential
of −71 to −81 mV were included for analysis. The frequency and amplitude of
mEPSCs were analyzed using Minianalysis software (Synaptosoft).
Blood sample collection. Submandibular vein bleeds62 were taken from mice 24 h
following the SI test and plasma was collected by centrifugation at 3000 r.p.m. for
15 min. Blood from chimeras was collected into ice-cold FACS buffer (Ca2+
Mg2+-free PBS supplemented with 2% heat inactivated FBS and 5 mM EDTA), red
blood cells were lysed using RBC lysis buffer (Biolegend) and cells were stained
with antibodies for flow cytometry assessment.
Flow cytometry and cell type analysis. Flow cytometry studies were performed
using a LSRII Fortessa (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed using FlowJo software
(Tree Star). Fluorochrome or biotin-conjugated mAbs specific for mouse B220
(clone RA3-6B2), CD11b (clone M1/70), CD45.1 (clone A20), CD45.2 (clone 104),
CSF-1R (also called CD115) (clone AFS98), Ly6C (clone HK1.4), Ly6G (clone
1A8), CD3 (clone 17A2), and the secondary reagents (allophycocyanin, peridinine
chlorophyll protein, and phycoerythrin-indotricarbocyanine-conjugated streptavi-
din) were obtained from BD Biosciences, eBioscience, or Biolegend30.
Perfusion and brain tissue processing. Mice were given a euthanizing dose of
chloral hydrate (15%) and transcardially perfused with cold PBS followed by
paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS). Brains were isolated and post-fixed overnight with
paraformaldehyde. Coronal sections were cut at 50 µm thickness on a Vibratome
(Leica) for immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies.
IHC and microscopy. Coronal slices were incubated with blocking solution (3%
normal donkey serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h. Slices were then incu-
bated with primary goat anti-mouse PSD95 ((Abcam), 1:1000) overnight at 4°C.
Slices were washed and incubated with secondary antibody for 2 h (Donkey anti-
goat Cy2 or Cy5 1:400 (Jackson ImmunoReserach)). Slices were washed and
stained with 1 µg/ml DAPI (Sigma) for 20 min, mounted and air-dried overnight.
Slices were quickly dehydrated with various concentrations of ethanol and cover-
slipped with DPX mounting medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Imaging of
PSD95 puncta were taken on a Zeiss LSM780 and 1 µm z-stacks were taken at ×100
magnification. Deconvolution was performed on all z-stacks with AutoQuant X
(Media Cybernetics).
Assessment of IL-6 expression in vitro in PBMCs. Whole blood from mice was
mixed with complete RPMI media and laid over the Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE
Healthcare, Sweden), centrifuged at 2200 r.p.m. for 15 min. The buffy coat con-
taining PBMCs were isolated, washed once with BEP (0.5% BSA, 2 mM EDTA in
PBS) and plated out in a 24-well plate at 5 × 105/well in culture medium RPMI-
1640 supplemented with 20% horse serum, 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 25 mM
Hepes and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. PBMCs were treated with various
phenolic acids for 16 h and challenged with 7.5 µg/ml LPS. Supernatant was col-
lected by centrifugation following 16 h of LPS stimulation and the levels of IL-6
were measured using the Mouse IL-6 Quantikine ELISA Kit from R & D System.
Cloning and expression of IL-6 promoter and intronic CpG-rich DNA. CpG-rich
motif from mouse IL-6 promoter and intron 1, intron 3, and intron 4 were cloned
into basic (no promoter or enhancer) or promoter (minimal EF1 promoter with no
enhancer) pCpG-free Lucia plasmid (InvivoGen) using In-Fusion Cloning Kit
(Clontech Laboratories). Plasmids were prepared in E. coli GT115 cells and
expressed in N2A neuoblastoma cells using lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher)
according to manufacturer’s instruction. Following overnight recovery, cells were
subjected to 5 µM of methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (AZA-DC) or
DHCA treatment. Twenty-four hours later, 10 µl of medium was incubated with
50 µl of QUANTI-Luc luciferase substrate for luciferase activity assessment.
Mouse MSNs enriched primary culture and treatment. Striatal tissue from E18
was mechanically triturated and centrifuged. Neurons were seeded onto a poly-D-
lysine-coated 12-well plate at 5 × 105 cells/well and cultured in Neurobasal med-
ium, supplemented with 2% B27, 0.5 mM L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-
streptomycin (Gibco-BRL, Invitrogen). Following 4 days in vitro (DIV), 5 µM of
Ara-c was used to inhibit the growth of glial cells. Following 10-day DIV culturing,
neurons were treated with select brain-bioavailable polyphenol metabolites for 16
h, washed once with cold PBS and RNA was then isolated. For virus infection, 10-
day DIV cultures were infected with either HSV-EGFP or HSV-Rac1 for 48 h
before RNA isolation.
RNA isolation and gene expression assessment. Total RNA from MSN-
enriched cultures or brain NAc was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA) and reverse transcribed. Gene expression was measured in four
replicates by quantitative RT-PCR using Maxima SYBR Green master mix (Fer-
mentas) in ABI Prism 7900HT. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary
Table 2. Mouse hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) expression level
was used as an internal control. Data were normalized using the 2-ΔΔCt method63.
Levels of target gene mRNAs were expressed relative to those in control cultures
or mice and plotted in GraphPad Prism.
Quantitative chromatin immuneprecipitation (qCHIP). Site-directed qChIP was
performed for pan-acH3 and H3K27me3 as described previously with modifica-
tion11. Neurons were washed once with PBS and crosslinked in 1% formaldehyde
for 15 min, quenched by glycine at a final concentration of 125 mM. Neurons were
then rinsed with cold PBS containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and
scraped off the plate. Cells were resuspended and sonicated with a Bioruptor (15
cycles, 30 sec on/off), which produces chromatin fragments ~350 bp in length.
Two-hundred microliters of sheared chromatin was used for each IP using 2 μg of
antibody to acetyl H3 or H3K27me3 (EMD Millipore) per sample in the presence
of protein A/G beads at 4 °C for overnight (~16 h). Samples were washed five times
with washing buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% TritonX100, 500 mM NaCl and 2 mM EDTA
in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH8) followed by one wash with LiCl washing buffer (150 mM
LiCl, 1% Na-deoxycholate, 1% NP-40 and 1 mM EDTA in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH8),
and eluted by heating to 65 °C with shaking on a Thermomixer for 30 min.
Chromatin was then reverse crosslinked by heating to 65 °C overnight and DNA
was purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). Levels of specific
histone modifications along the Rac1 promoter were determined by measuring the
amount of acetylated or methylated histone-associated DNA using quantitative
real-time PCR as previously described11.
Multiplex ELISA for cell signaling and mouse cytokines assays. Luminex
xMAP multiplexed immunoassays were used to evaluate the levels of phosphory-
lated proteins in PBMCs pre-treated with DHCA for 16 h followed by LPS sti-
mulation. PBMCs were washed once with PBS and immediately lysed with
MilliplexMAP Cell Signaling Universal Lysis Buffer and applied to the assay fol-
lowing manufacturer’s instruction (EMD Millipore). The phosphoprotein analytes
used were: AKT (Ser473), JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), ERK (Thr185/Tyr187), p38
(Thr189/Tyr182) (Millipore, MA). Multiplex MAP mouse cytokine/chemokine
Panel (EMD Millipore) was used to measure the levels of 32 cytokines/chemokines
in mouse plasma or PBMC cultures.
In vitro cytotoxicity. MTT and LDH release assays were conducted in MSN-
enriched primary neurons and in PBMCs64. Cellular cytotoxicity was conducted in
HepG2 cells using high content screening (HCS) protocols65. Briefly, HepG2 cells
were plated on 384-well tissue culture treated black walled clear bottomed poly-
styrene plates and treated with varying concentrations of Mal-gluc or DHCA. The
cells were loaded with the relevant dye/antibody for each cell-health marker fol-
lowing incubation, including cell count, markers for nuclear size, DNA structure,
cell membrane permeability, mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial membrane
potential and cytochrome C release. The plates were then scanned using an
automated fluorescent cellular imager ArrayScanr (Thermo Scientific Cellomics).
In vitro cardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity was assessed using CHO cells stably
transfected with the hERG using the IonWorks HT instrument (Molecular Devices
Corporation), which automatically performs electrophysiology measurements in
48 single cells simultaneously in a specialized 384-well plate (PatchPlate)42. A

 single-cell suspension was added to the wells of a PatchPlate to form an electrical
seal at the bottom and pre-compound currents were recorded. Various con-
centrations of Mal-gluc or DHCA were added to the cells in four replicates for 5
min and post-compound currents were then recorded. Post-compound currents
are then expressed as a percentage of pre-compound currents and plotted against
concentration for each compound and IC50 was calculated.
Compound stability. Compound stability in mouse and human plasma and in
mouse brain homogenate were conducted44, 45. Specifically, Mal-gluc or DHCA
was incubated in duplicate with plasma at 37 °C and samples were taken at various
time points and mixed with three volumes of ice-cold Stop Solution (methanol
containing propranolol, diclofenac, or other internal standard). Samples were
centrifuged to remove precipitated protein, and the supernatants were analyzed by
LC/MS/MS to quantitate for remaining test compound. Data are converted to
percentage remaining by dividing by the time zero concentration value. Data are fit
to a first-order decay model to determine half-life. Plasma protein binding were
conducted using both mouse and human plasma45.
Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) inhibition assay. CYP inhibition was tested
in isolated microsomes for CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19,
CYP2C8, and CYP2B666. Briefly, increasing concentrations of Mal-gluc or DHCA
were incubated with human liver microsomes (HLM) in the presence of 2 mM
NADPH in 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 5 mM magnesium
chloride and a specific probe substrate for different CYPs: tacrine (CYP1A2),
amodiaquine (CYP2C8), tolbutamide (CYP2C9), S-mephenytoin (CYP2C19),
dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), midazolam/testosterone (CYP3A4/5), or bupropion
(CYP2B6). CYP-specific inhibitors were included alongside the test compound as a
positive control, including α-naphthoflavone (CYP1A2), quercetin (CYP2C8),
ketoconazole (CYP3A4/5), quinidine (CYP2D6), sulfaphenazole (CYP2C9), and
ticlopidine (CYP2C19, CYP2B6). After incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were
terminated by addition of a methanol-containing internal standard (propranolol)
for analytical quantification. The quenched samples were then incubated at 4 °C for
10 min and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and the
probe substrate metabolite was analyzed by LC-MS/MS (Agilent Technologies
Triple Quad LC-MS/MS).
Radioligand binding assay. Radioligand binding assays were performed as pre-
viously described67. Briefly, crude membrane fractions prepared from a stable HEK
cell line expressing recombinant receptors were mixed with a radiolabeled specific
ligand and 10 µM of competitor compound (DHCA, Mal-gluc, or non-specific
ligand). The percentage of radioligand binding was subsequently measured.
Compounds that showed a minimum 50% inhibition were subjected to a secondary
radioligand binding assay to determine equilibrium binding.
Overall statistics. All values are expressed as mean and s.e.m. For dose finding,
one-way ANOVAs were used to compare all groups followed by Bonferroni’s
comparison of testing group and the control group. For behavioral (SI and sucrose
preference tests) as well as biochemical analyses comparing control group vs.
testing group, one-way ANOVAs followed by Bonferroni’s comparison or unpaired
two-tailed student’s t-tests with Welch’s correction were used. In all studies, out-
liers (2 s.d. from the mean) were excluded and the null hypothesis was rejected at
the 0.05 level. All statistical analyses were performed using Prism Stat program
(GraphPad Software, Inc.).
