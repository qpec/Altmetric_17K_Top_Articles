Overweight and obese individuals differ in their degree of hedonic eating. This may reflect adaptations in
reward-related neural circuits, regulated in part by opioidergic activity. We examined an indirect, func-
tional measure of central opioidergic activity by assessing cortisol and nausea responses to acute opioid
blockade using the opioid antagonist naltrexone in overweight/obese women (mean BMI = 31.1 ± 4.8)
prior to the start of a mindfulness-based intervention to reduce stress eating. In addition, we assessed
indices of hedonic-related eating, including eating behaviors (binge eating, emotional eating, external
eating, restraint) and intake of sweets/desserts and carbohydrates (Block Food Frequency); interoceptive
awareness (which is associated with dysregulated eating behavior); and level of adiposity at baseline.
Naltrexone-induced increases in cortisol were associated with greater emotional and restrained eating
and lower interoceptive awareness. Naltrexone-induced nausea was associated with binge eating and
higher adiposity. Furthermore, in a small exploratory analysis, naltrexone-induced nausea predicted
treatment response to the mindfulness intervention, as participants with more severe nausea at baseline
maintained weight whereas those with little or no nausea responses tended to gain weight. These preli-
minary data suggest that naltrexone-induced cortisol release and nausea may help identify individuals
who have greater underlying food reward dependence, which leads to an excessive drive to eat. Future
research is needed to confirm this finding and to test if these markers of opioidergic tone might help pre-
dict success in certain types of weight management programs.

Introduction
With the advent of the obesity epidemic and the abundance of
palatable foods in the current food environment, the concept of he-
donic eating has emerged. Hedonic eating refers to eating for the
pleasurable, rewarding aspects of food, in contrast to homeostatic
eating, which refers to eating for caloric need (Lowe & Butryn,
2007). Hedonic eating has been implicated in the concept of ‘‘food
addiction,’’ the existence of which is being hotly debated in scien-
tific and public discourses (Avena, Gearhardt, Gold, Wang, & Poten-
za, 2012; Ziauddeen, Farooqi, & Fletcher, 2012). Theorists propose
that hedonic-driven eating can cause people to become addicted to
food or its specific components in ways that resemble drug addic-
tion (Davis, Zai, et al., 2011; Moreno & Tandon, 2011). In turn, these
eating behaviors may lead to weight gain and obesity in a subset of
individuals.
Evidence supporting the concept of food addiction is accruing as
neuroimaging studies reveal that both obese and drug addicted
individuals have alterations in brain regions associated with re-
ward sensitivity, incentive motivation, memory and learning, im-
pulse control, stress reactivity, and interoceptive awareness (for a
review, see Volkow, Wang, Fowler, Tomasi, & Baler, 2011). In ani-
mal studies, growing evidence indicates that palatable foods preva-
lent in our food supply (in particular, those containing high levels

 of sugar and fat) possess addictive properties. Rats given access to
highly palatable foods display classic features of addiction, includ-
ing binging, withdrawal, craving, and cross-sensitization as found
in response to drugs of abuse (Avena, 2010).
The opioid system is in part contained within an important neu-
ral circuit involved in both substance use and food reward. Acute
consumption of palatable food stimulates release of endogenous
opioids, which mediate feelings of pleasure (Yeomans & Gray,
2002). However, repeated over-stimulation of post-synaptic opioid
receptors due to chronic intake of palatable foods may elicit long-
term changes in receptor function or transduction mechanisms
that subsequently down-regulate opioid action (Kelley, Will, Stein-
inger, Zhang, & Haber, 2003). For instance, rats given frequent ac-
cess to chocolate or sucrose that elicit binge eating behaviors
show reduced expression of enkephalins (an endogenous opioid)
in the ventral striatum, a brain region involved in reward (Kelley
et al., 2003; Spangler et al., 2004). The resulting opioidergic state
may induce a state of withdrawal. Rats given chronic access to a
high sucrose diet and then either abruptly taken off or treated with
an opioid antagonist demonstrate behaviors consistent with opiate
withdrawal (Colantuoni et al., 2002). A withdrawal state, in turn,
can increase incentive salience for sugar, as found in alcohol abuse
(Avena, Long, & Hoebel, 2005). The ‘‘wanting’’ of a food reward is
mediated through l-opioid signaling in the nucleus accumbens
(Shin, Pistell, Phifer, & Berthoud, 2010). These various animal stud-
ies demonstrate that central opioid activity is involved in core
addiction processes related to palatable foods, in particular, binge-
ing, withdrawal, and craving.
Despite compelling neurobiological models of addiction in ani-
mals, there is a paucity of direct evidence to validate the concept of
hedonic-driven eating or food addiction in humans (Ziauddeen &
Fletcher, 2013). There are no validated functional markers of cen-
tral opioidergic activity in humans, short of positron-emission
tomography (PET) scans to assess opioid receptor binding poten-
tial. However, as an indirect functional measure, the effects of opi-
oid antagonists on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA)
have been studied to assess the role of endogenous opioidergic
activity in alcohol and nicotine addictions (e.g., al’Absi et al.,
2008; Ouwens, van Strien, van Leeuwe, & van der Staak, 2009;
Wand, Mangold, El Deiry, McCaul, & Hoover, 1998; Wand et al.,
2012). Endogenous opioids inhibit the HPA axis through two path-
ways. First, neurons in the arcuate nucleus containing b-endorphin
and enkephalin activate l-opioid receptors in the paraventricular
nucleus to inhibit corticotropin releasing-hormone (CRH) release
(Yajima et al., 1986). Opioids also inhibit the activity of norephi-
nephrine-containing neurons in the locus coeruleus, which acti-
vate hypothalamic CRH neurons (Valentino, Rudoy, Saunders, Liu,
& Van Bockstaele, 2001). Phamacologic blockade of opioid recep-
tors releases the opioidergic inhibitory input to CRH neurons, stim-
ulating
pituitary
adrenocorticotropic
hormone
(ACTH),
and
eventually cortisol from the adrenal glands. As a result, individual
differences in central opioidergic activity can be detected by corti-
sol response to opioid antagonism. Greater increases in cortisol re-
lease to an opioid antagonist may indicate weaker endogenous
opioid tone as a result of fewer endogenous opioids available to
compete for binding sites, or a reduction in opioid receptor density
resulting in a more complete blockade of inhibitory inputs to the
hypothalamus (Roche, Childs, Epstein, & King, 2010; Wand et al.,
1998). Thus far, one study found that patients with bulimia had
higher cortisol levels in response to naloxone (an opioid antogon-
ist) as compared to controls (Coiro et al., 1990).
While the exact mechanisms underlying the association be-
tween cortisol responses, central opioidergic activity, and opioid
antagonists are unknown, we theorized that chronic overconsump-
tion of highly palatable foods downregulates endogenous opioid
peptide production or receptor density, which would be reflected
by increased cortisol in response to an opioid antagonist. We also
postulated that nausea responses to opioid antagonism may be a
second indicator of central opioid activity, as those with low opio-
idergic tone may feel more nauseous after acute opioid blockade.
Naltrexone therapy (primarily a l-opioid antagonist) in combina-
tion with bupropion results in clinically significant weight loss
(Apovian et al., 2013) supporting the role of the opioid system in
eating behavior and weight gain. Yet nausea is a common side ef-
fect of naltrexone, and a qualitative review suggests it may be in-
creased in persons with obesity (Yeomans & Gray, 2002). In two
large clinical trials that administered naltrexone to obese individ-
uals, 30–34% reported nausea in the drug therapy condition com-
pared to 5–11% in the placebo group (Katsiki, Hatzitolios, &
Mikhailidis, 2011). Thus far, the relationship between naltrexone-
induced nausea and hedonic-related eating remains unexplored.
In the current study, we assessed cortisol and nausea responses
to a standardized naltrexone challenge among overweight and ob-
ese women. In cross-sectional analyses, we tested if these re-
sponses were associated with hedonic-related eating behaviors,
including binge, emotional, and external-based eating. We also
examined dietary restraint because, although it does not explicitly
measure hedonic eating, people high on restraint overeat in the
face of stress or cognitive load (Lowe & Kral, 2006). Dietary re-
straint has also been recently re-conceptualized as reflecting a la-
tent hedonic eating drive, with highly restrained individuals
eating less than they want, rather than less than they need (Lowe
& Butryn, 2007). We also assessed the relation between cortisol
and nausea responses to naltrexone with dietary intake and adi-
posity. When given naltrexone, women reporting higher levels of
hedonic-related eating behaviors may demonstrate a more severe
opiate-like withdrawal state, similar to the rat model of high sugar
intake (Colantuoni et al., 2002). Therefore, we predicted greater
nausea and cortisol responses to naltrexone, presumably indicating
weaker opioidergic activity, would be associated with higher levels
of hedonic-related eating behaviors, greater intake of palatable
foods, and excess adiposity.
We also explored the association of naltrexone responses with
interoceptive awareness, the perception of sensations originating
from inside the body. According to recent theories, interoceptive
awareness is important for regulating homeostasis and may be al-
tered as a result of addiction (Goldstein et al., 2009; Naqvi & Bec-
hara, 2010; Paulus, Tapert, & Schulteis, 2009). Because addicted
individuals chronically experience aversive bodily states either
resulting from withdrawal symptoms or emotional distress, they
may react more impulsively to sensations of craving or withdrawal
either to satisfy urges or alleviate the aversive state (Paulus et al.,
2009). As a first step towards understanding the potential relation
between opioid-mediated food addictive processes and interocep-
tive awareness, we examined whether self-reported aspects of
interoceptive awareness were related to naltrexone responses.
Lastly, responses to acute opioid blockade may have clinical
utility by predicting individual differences in treatment response
to interventions for overweight and obese individuals. We ex-
plored whether naltrexone responses at baseline predicted weight
change among women enrolled in a randomized waitlist-control
pilot study of a mindfulness-based intervention for stress eating
(Daubenmier et al., 2011).
Methods
Participants
This paper reports on baseline data collected from a subset of
women (N = 33) who elected to participate in a substudy of a ran-
domized waitlist control pilot trial of a mindfulness intervention

 for stress eating (N = 47), described previously (Daubenmier et al.,
2011). Sample characteristics are reported in Table 1. The ethnic
composition of the sample was 64% White, 18% Asian–American,
15% Hispanic/Latina, and 3% identified as another ethnicity. Five
participants were on stable anti-depressant medication.
The Institutional Review Board of the University of California,
San Francisco (UCSF) approved this study and all participants pro-
vided informed consent. Briefly, adult female participants were
recruited through media outlets with key eligibility criteria as
follows: a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 40; pre-
menopausal; no history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease, or
active endocrinologic disorder; not pregnant or less than one year
postpartum; no prior or current meditation or yoga practice; not
currently on a diet plan or taking medications that would affect
weight; no current self-reported eating disorder or alcohol or
drug addiction; not taking opiate pain medication, steroids, or
antipsychotic
medications;
and
English
literate.
Participants
provided a urine sample to test for the presence of opioids or
other drugs and pregnancy. All tests were negative. Eligible and
interested participants completed two assessment visits at the
UCSF Clinical Research Center (for eligibility and anthropomet-
rics) and an on-line questionnaire battery at baseline. They were
assessed again with a similar visit and questionnaire battery post-
intervention.
Baseline assessments
Cortisol and nausea reponses to naltrexone
All baseline assessments were completed prior to randomiza-
tion. Participants were instructed to complete home saliva sam-
pling kits to assess cortisol levels on 4 days. The first three days
were control days to assess diurnal cortisol rhythms upon waking,
30 min after waking (to capture morning rise), at 1 pm, 2 pm, 3 pm,
and 4 pm. Participants were instructed to collect the first sample
while in bed, and to not eat, drink, brush their teeth or engage in
vigorous activity between the first two morning samples or for
20 min prior to all other samples.
On the fourth day, participants took a clinical dose of naltrexone
(50 mg) after the 1 pm saliva sample after lunch to control for cor-
tisol responses to food intake. The 50 mg dose was chosen because
it is the FDA-approved dosage for treatment of alcohol and opioid
dependencies and it has been used in other studies (Roche et al.,
2010). The timing of the saliva collection was determined based
on studies showing evidence of peak levels of naltrexone and
cortisol concentrations 1–3 h after administration of naltrexone
(King et al., 2002b). Participants were told about possible negative
side effects including nausea and given a list of Frequently Asked
Questions about naltrexone to take home with them that described
the side effects. No placebo condition was administered. Each sam-
ple was collected by drooling into a straw in 2 mL SaliCaps tubes
(IBL Hamburg, Germany). Cortisol analysis was performed at Dres-
den LabService at the Dresden University of Technology (Germany)
using a commercial chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA; IBL
Hamburg, Germany). Values greater than 100 nmol/L were ex-
cluded because they fell outside the range of the assay.
To assess nausea symptoms, participants completed a checklist
of 14 symptoms, including nausea, using a 4-point scale (0 = none,
1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Participants were asked to
complete the checklist right before bedtime. Participants without
a complete checklist were called by study staff to complete missing
items.
Anthropometric variables
A standard stadiometer (Perspective Enterprises, Portage, MI)
was used to measure height to the nearest 1/8th inch. A digital
scale (Wheelchair Scale 6002, Scale-Tronix, Carol Stream, IL) was
used to measure weight to the nearest 0.1 kg. Body mass index
was calculated (kg/m2). Weight was reassessed post-intervention.
Body fat
Whole-body dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans
were performed to assess total percent body fat. The DEXA densi-
tometer (GE Healthcare Lunar Prodigy, Madison, WI, USA) was ad-
justed to the fan beam mode and EnCore software version 9.15 was
used. The coefficient of variation in assessing fat mass from the
UCSF General Clinical Research Center densitometer is 4%.
Eating behaviors
The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) (Van Strien,
Frijters, Bergersm, & Defares, 1986) assesses restrained eating,
emotional eating, and external-based eating. The restrained eating
subscale evaluates intentions and behaviors to restrict food intake
due to concerns about weight. Paradoxically, restrained eating pre-
dicts palatable food intake in response to non-stressful cognitive
activities, suggesting that restrained eaters have a latent suscepti-
bility to overconsume palatable foods (Leon, Fulkerson, Perry, &
Early-Zald, 1995). The Emotional Eating subscale measures eating
behaviors triggered by negative emotions, such as anger, boredom,
anxiety, or fear. The external-based eating subscale assesses eating
in response to food-related stimuli, such as the smell or taste of
food or presence of food in the environment. Responses were made
on a 5-point scale from 1 = never to 5 = very often.
The Binge Eating Scale (BES) was used to assess the extent and
severity of compulsive overeating patterns, including behavioral
tendencies (e.g., eating large amounts of food) and negative feel-
ings and thoughts related to binge eating episodes or one’s body
(Gormally, Black, Daston, & Rardin, 1982). It is a continuous mea-
sure sensitive to a wide range of concerns and patterns with over-
eating rather than diagnostic of binge eating disorder.
Interoceptive awareness
The Body Responsiveness Questionnaire (BRQ) is a 7-item scale
used to assess aspects of interoceptive awareness (Daubenmier,
2005; Mehling et al., 2009). A principal components factor analysis
reveals two factors in past research (Daubenmier, unpublished
analyses) as well as in the current study. The factor loadings were
greater than .40 explaining 68% of the variance of the scale. The
first subscale, ‘‘Importance of Interoceptive Awareness,’’ assesses
the importance of using interoceptive information to consciously
regulate behavior and self-awareness (sample items include: ‘‘It

The second subscale, ‘‘Perceived Disconnection,’’ measures the ex-
tent of disconnection between psychological and physical states
(sample items include: ‘‘My mind and my body often want to do
different things’’; ‘‘My bodily desires lead me to do things that I
end up regretting’’). Responses were measured on a 7-point scale
ranging from 1 = not at all true about me to 7 = very true about me.
Dietary intake
The Block (2005) Food Frequency Questionnaire, a semi-quanti-
tative food frequency questionnaire, was used to assess food con-
sumption of 110 food items over the past year (Block, 2005).
Percent calories from carbohydrates, fat, and sweets/desserts were
calculated according to analyses performed by NutritionQuest.
Intervention groups
All participants were randomized to the treatment or waitlist
control group in a 1:1 ratio and stratified by BMI category (over-
weight: BMI 25–29.99 vs. obese: 30–39.99), age (P40 years) and
current anti-depressant medication use (n = 7), as these factors
may influence weight change. In the current substudy, 16 were
randomized to the intervention and 17 to the control group.
Treatment condition
A
novel
intervention
was
developed
by
integrating
components from three empirically-validated programs, Mindful-
ness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) (Kabat-Zinn, 1990), Mindful-
ness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression, (Teasdale et al.,
2000), and Mindfulness Based Eating Awareness Training (MB-
EAT) (Kristeller & Hallett, 1999a; Kristeller & Wolever, 2011).
Mindfulness meditation entails the systematic training of a fo-
cused state of awareness through repeated attendance to sensa-
tions
of
breath,
other
sensory
experiences,
thoughts,
and
emotions, as well as the development of a nonjudgmental atti-
tude. MB-EAT, in particular, promotes awareness of physiological
cues related to hunger, satiety, and taste satisfaction and emo-
tional triggers for overeating. In the current study, the interven-
tion program consisted of nine 2.5-h classes and one 7-h silent
day of guided meditation practice during the sixth week of the
program. Participants were encouraged to engage in daily home
assignments that included up to 30 min per day of formal mind-
fulness meditation practices and to practice mindful eating during
meals. More details regarding the intervention are described else-
where (Daubenmier et al., 2011).
Control condition
To provide guidelines for healthy eating and exercise during the
intervention and to control for the effects of such information on
study outcomes, both groups participated in a 2-h nutrition and
exercise information session aimed at moderate weight loss mid-
way through the intervention, in which mindfulness was not
discussed.
Statistical analysis
Participants who had at least one day of control cortisol data
were included in analyses. Paired samples t-tests using the least
squares differences method were used to compare differences
between cortisol concentrations at 1 pm, 2 pm, 3 pm, and 4 pm
on the mean of the three control days and the naltrexone day,
and to compare differences between times on the control days
and the naltrexone day. We calculated two indicators of the cor-
tisol response to naltrexone to explore the predictive utility of
each measure. The first indicator was calculated by subtracting
the peak cortisol response (at 4 pm) from the cortisol level in
the 1 pm sample on the naltrexone day. The second indicator
was calculated by subtracting the change in cortisol from 1 pm
to 4 pm on the naltrexone day from the mean difference from
1 pm to 4 pm on the control days to explore the added sensitiv-
ity of the measure when baseline cortisol concentrations were
taken into account. Due to a skewed distribution of the cortisol
response, Spearman’s rank correlations were used to assess asso-
ciations
among
cortisol
responses
to
naltrexone
and
other
measures.
Self-reported nausea was assessed by dividing participants into
low (none or mild) and high (moderate or severe) symptom groups
and independent sample t-tests were conducted to compare differ-
ences between groups on eating behavior, interoceptive aware-
ness, and body fat measures. Levene’s test for equality of
variances was used to test for equality of variances between groups
and degrees of freedom were adjusted for the independent sample
t-tests if the test was significant (p < .05). To explore nausea as a
predictor of weight change within the treatment group, a 2 � 2 AN-
COVA was performed with treatment group (treatment vs. waitlist
control group) and nausea group (low vs. high symptoms) as be-
tween-subjects factors and with BMI and antidepressant medica-
tion use as covariates. The continuous variables of cortisol
responses to naltrexone were examined as predictors of weight
change by treatment group using multiple regression analysis.
Baseline BMI, antidepressant medication use, treatment group,
and cortisol response were entered on step 1 and the interaction
term (treatment group � cortisol response) was entered on step
2 of the equation.
Results
Participants who elected to take part in the substudy had a sig-
nificantly greater percentage of total adiposity compared to those
who declined (45.7 ± 5.0 vs. 42.5 ± 3.7, p = .047). No other baseline
differences (including sociodemographic or psychological vari-
ables) were significant between those who elected or declined to
take part in the substudy. Three participants did not provide saliva
samples or take naltrexone as prescribed, and were excluded from
relevant analyses. Twenty-seven participants (82%) had complete
cortisol data on all three control days and 30 participants (91%)
had complete cortisol data on the naltrexone day. Twenty-seven
participants (82%) had cortisol data on at least one control day
and the naltrexone day. Three participants failed to answer the
nausea question.
Cortisol and nausea responses
Cortisol decreased by 3.6 ± 2.2 nmol/L between 1 pm and 4 pm
on the control days (95% CI: 2.8–4.4; t(32) = 9.4, p < .001) and in-
creased on the naltrexone day by 8.0 ± 17.4 nmol/L (95% CI: 1.5–
14.5; t(29) = 2.53, p = .02) between 1 pm and 4 pm (see Fig. 1). Cor-
tisol concentrations did not differ significantly between control
days and the naltrexone day at the baseline timepoint of 1 pm
[t(30) = 0.80;
p = .43].
By
2 pm,
cortisol
values
were
3.3 ± 8.1 nmol/L (95% CI: 0.2–6.4) higher on the naltrexone day
(1 h after taking naltrexone) than the average cortisol values on
control days [t(28) = 2.2, p = .04]. By 3 pm, cortisol values were
9.0 ± 12.5 nmol/L (95% CI: 4.4–13.6) higher on the naltrexone day
than
the
average
cortisol
values
on
control
days
at
2 pm
[t(30) = 4.0, p < .001]. This difference increased by 4 pm, with mean
cortisol values on the naltrexone day that were 11.5 ± 17.9 nmol/L
(95% CI: 5.1–18.0) higher than cortisol values on control days
[t(31) = 3.6, p = .001].

 The mean level of nausea severity was 1.23 ± 1.3. Due to a
skewed distribution, participants were divided into low vs. high
nausea groups, with 60% of participants (n = 18) reporting none
to mild nausea and 40% reporting moderate to severe levels
(n = 12). Peak cortisol responses to naltrexone (i.e., difference be-
tween the 1 pm and 4 pm) tended to be higher among participants
reporting more severe nausea (13.4 ± 17.3 nmol/L) compared to
those with low nausea [2.0 ± 10.9 nmol/L; t(13.3) = �1.9, p = .08,
see Fig. 2].
Correlations between cortisol naltrexone responses and adipos-
ity, hedonic eating behaviors, and interoceptive awareness are
shown in Table 2. Greater peak cortisol responses on the naltrex-
one day were significantly associated with higher emotional and
restrained eating and lower importance of interoceptive aware-
ness. To illustrate the finding in high vs. low emotional eaters
see Fig. 3. Greater peak cortisol responses to naltrexone relative
to control days was significantly related to greater restrained eat-
ing, lower scores on importance of interoceptive awareness, great-
er carbohydrate intake, and marginally related to greater intake of
sweets and desserts.
As shown in Table 3, the high nausea group had significantly
greater percent body fat, reported greater binge eating symptoms,
and tended to have higher BMIs, and report more emotional eating
and less importance of interoceptive awareness compared to the
low nausea group, with these last three differences of marginal sta-
tistical significance. The means of percent caloric intake from
sweets and desserts were in the predicted direction, with higher
intake among the high nausea group, but the difference did not
reach statistical significance.

p = .004] but with no significant differences by nausea group in the
waitlist condition [F (1,9) = 0.3, p = .58]. Multiple regression analy-
ses examining cortisol responses to naltrexone as a predictor of
weight change by treatment group and across groups were not sig-
nificant (p > .76).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate an indi-
rect functional measure of central opioidergic activity in relation
to hedonic-related eating behaviors among overweight and obese
adults. First, we established that the clinical paradigm of response
to naltrexone was working as expected. We tested acute effects of
a single, clinical dose of the opioid antagonist naltrexone on corti-
sol concentrations and nausea severity. Cortisol concentrations in-
creased 103% on average in response to naltrexone over a 3-h
period, whereas they decreased 48% on average across three con-
trol days without naltrexone during the same time period. These
findings replicate those of prior studies showing reliable naltrex-
one-induced increases in HPA activity (al’Absi et al., 2008; King
et al., 2002a; Roche et al., 2010). We also found a wide range of
individual variation in nausea severity in response to naltrexone,
with a subgroup of 40% showing a meaningful (moderate to severe)
level of nausea. We then tested whether these differential re-
sponses in cortisol and nausea predicted indices of hedonic-related
eating and adiposity.
In line with our hypotheses, individual differences in naltrex-
one-induced cortisol and nausea responses were associated with
greater hedonic-related eating behaviors, intake of carbohydrates,
adiposity, a trend for increased palatable food intake, and lower
interoceptive awareness. It is not clear in this cross-sectional study
whether hedonic eating behavior contributes to low opioid activ-
ity, or whether pre-existing low activity increases drive to eat, or
both. Animal studies suggest that binge eating on palatable foods
down-regulates opioidergic activity (Kelley et al., 2003; Spangler
et al., 2004), whereas genetically-driven low opioidergic activity
may induce hedonic overeating as a way to compensate for low ba-
sal levels of pleasure based on studies of the l-opioid receptor
OPRMI genotype (Davis, Curtis, et al., 2011).
Although causality is unclear, the positive associations of nal-
trexone-induced cortisol responses with emotional and restrained
eating are consistent with recent models of stress eating. People
high on restrained or emotional eating tend to overeat sweet and
fatty foods in response to stress or cognitively demanding tasks

 (Wallis & Hetherington, 2004). Consumption of palatable foods due
to emotional or disinhibited eating stemming from restrained eat-
ing attitudes may produce surges in opioidergic activity and serve
to reduce acute stress responses. Support for this model comes
from animal studies which show that rats eating a diet high in
fat and sugar have reduced HPA responses to acute stressors com-
pared to rats eating chow (Dallman, Pecoraro, & la Fleur, 2005). If
emotional or restrained eating becomes chronic, this may down-
regulate opioidergic activity and increasingly require greater con-
sumption of palatable foods to regulate the feeling of stress or even
maintain feelings of well-being, fostering dependency and addic-
tive-like behaviors. Thus, greater naltrexone-induced cortisol re-
sponses, potentially reflecting low opioid activity, may in part
reflect overconsumption of palatable foods to dampen HPA stress
responses.
An alternative explanation is that high naltrexone-induced cor-
tisol responses do not reflect opioid sensitivity but merely reflect
general hyperactivity of the HPA. If this were the case, one might
expect to find a strong positive correlation between cortisol re-
sponses on the naltrexone day and on control days when no drug
was administered; however this was not the case (Spearman’s
rho = .22, p = .25) suggesting that hypersensitivity of the HPA axis
alone does not account for the present findings. However, a further
test would be to establish whether cortisol levels in response to
some other mild stressor or challenge (e.g., ACTH) fully account
for the findings. It is important to note though that chronically
low endogenous opioidergic activity may also result in greater cor-
tisol reactivity to stressors due to opioidergic inhibitory input in
the hypothalamus.
Higher cortisol responses to naltrexone were also positively re-
lated to greater dietary intake of carbohydrates and, marginally, to
greater intake of sweets and desserts, but were not related to fat
intake. These findings are congruent with those of animal studies
suggesting that sugar binging leads to down-regulation of the
endogenous opioid system (Corwin, Avena, & Boggiano, 2011),
but binging on fatty foods does not have addictive effects, as fatty
foods do not produce somatic or anxiety symptoms of opiate-like
withdrawal (Bocarsly, Berner, Hoebel, & Avena, 2011). One possible
explanation for the inability of fat to alter the opioid system in-
volves the neuropeptide galanin (GAL), which is stimulated in re-
ward areas in response to a high-fat meal. GAL may inhibit
opiate reward, as peripheral injections of galnon, a synthetic GAL
agonist, decrease opiate withdrawal signs in morphine-addicted
mice (as reviewed in Avena, Rada, & Hoebel, 2009). Thus, binging
on high-fat foods may attenuate opioid reward due to increases
in GAL. Our findings are consistent with the theory that carbohy-
drate-rich sugary rather than fatty foods have addictive properties
mediated by the opioid system (Garber & Lustig, 2011).
Nausea severity was positively associated with total adiposity.
This finding confirms qualitative observations in the literature that
reports of nausea increase with BMI (Yeomans & Gray, 2002). In
addition, nausea severity was associated with higher scores on
the Binge Eating Scale, an indicator of a general pattern of compul-
sive overeating behavior. Nausea severity also tended to be related
to greater emotional eating. These findings are analogous to those
from a rat study, when after binging on a high-sucrose diet, rats
showed
greater
withdrawal
symptoms
following
naltrexone
administration compared to control rats (Colantuoni et al., 2002).
More severe nausea may be a type of withdrawal symptom due
to low levels of opioidergic activity. As suggested by animal stud-
ies, chronic intermittent intake of large amounts of palatable foods
may down-regulate opioidergic activity. Thus, individuals who
binge eat may have lower opioidergic activity.
One outstanding question regarding the overall results concerns
the different pattern of associations between the two markers of
opioidergic activity. Here we assume that both nausea and cortisol
increases to opioid blockade reflect underlying low opioidergic
activity and thus could be characterized as withdrawal symptoms
from blockade. Indeed, the high nausea group tended to have high-
er cortisol responses compared to the low nausea group. However,
the cortisol response is more associated with emotional eating and
dietary restraint, whereas the nausea response is more related to
binge eating and adiposity. Cortisol concentrations increase as a re-
sult of decreased opioidergic inhibitory input on the HPA axis,
whereas the subjective reports of nausea are a result of complex
phenomena involving central and peripheral processing, as well
as primitive and higher order cognitions and emotional responses.
Therefore, it may not be surprising that cortisol reactivity and sub-
jective nausea are not highly coordinated responses and operate
differently. Further, cortisol increases were clearly in response to
naltrexone, whereas our measure of nausea may be more trait-like,
as we did not assess nausea on the control days. In more controlled
studies, future work is needed to understand how cortisol and nau-
sea responses may underlie unique and common mechanisms of
naltrexone
responses
associated
with
hedonic-related
eating
patterns.
Low interoceptive awareness has been found to predict hedonic
eating behavior and disordered eating (Leon et al., 1995; Ouwens
et al., 2009). It is also thought that interoceptive awareness is dys-
regulated in addiction (Goldstein et al., 2009; Naqvi & Bechara,
2010; Paulus et al., 2009). We found that placing less importance
on interoceptive awareness to regulate behavior and self-aware-
ness was associated with greater cortisol responses. Greater nau-
sea tended to be related to less importance of interoceptive
awareness as well. These novel findings offer preliminary support
for the theory that interoceptive awareness as a form of self-
awareness that facilitates insight and self-control is reduced in
addiction (Goldstein et al., 2009). Further research is warranted
to understand the involvement of interoceptive awareness in the
syndrome of reward-based eating.
Lastly, we examined whether cortisol or nausea responses pre-
dicted treatment response for women enrolled in a mindfulness
intervention for stress eating. Our analysis was exploratory, given
the small sample size and lack of specific predictions. On one hand,
women demonstrating a greater indication of opioid-mediated he-
donic eating may be more resistant to treatment compared to wo-
men with less indication. On the other hand, mindfulness training
has shown promise for treating substance use and binge eating dis-
orders and may be particularly apt to improve self-regulation and
eating in response to cravings and negative emotions (Bowen et al.,
2009; Kristeller & Hallett, 1999b; Kristeller & Wolever, 2011).
Interestingly, we found that participants with more severe nausea
at baseline, presumably indicating lower opioidergic activity, had
better weight maintenance following the mindfulness intervention
compared to participants with less nausea who gained weight. No
differences in weight maintenance were found between the low
and high nausea individuals in the waitlist group. Our sample
was small and conclusions should be held tentatively. Yet, with
this limitation in mind, these results suggest that mindfulness
training may potentially be an effective treatment for overweight
to obese adults with high levels of hedonic eating or features of
food addiction.
We examined two indicators of cortisol responses: the peak rise
in cortisol 3 h after naltrexone administration and the peak rise
relative to a mean change when naltrexone was not administered.
Response on the naltrexone day alone (not compared to control
days) was a stronger predictor of hedonic eating, suggesting a
one day assessment may be a sufficient biomarker for opioidergic
activity, although this finding demands replication.
A significant limitation of the present study is the lack of a pla-
cebo condition. In addition, participants were given, in advance, a
list of numerous possible side effects, of which nausea was one,
98
J. Daubenmier et al. / Appetite 74 (2014) 92–100
 and nausea responses may reflect individual differences in sug-
gestibility. Also, some participants recalled their level of nausea
retrospectively over the phone. However, the percentage of partic-
ipants reporting at least moderate nausea in this study (40%) is
similar to the percentage of obese patients reporting nausea in
large scale placebo-controlled clinical trials of naltrexone (30–
34%) (Katsiki et al., 2011). Even if participant reports of nausea in-
volved suggestibility to some extent, 30% of participants reported
severe nausea (and five reported vomiting), which is unlikely the
result of suggestibility. Suggestibility may influence nausea ratings
to some extent, but would not likely also induce greater adiposity
and hedonic eating drive. In other words, it is unlikely that sug-
gestibility is causing both nausea and signs of dysregulated eating,
or causing the relationship observed between the two. Future re-
search will need to address this limitation by including a double-
blind placebo condition. Another limitation is the small sample,
and it could be argued that the levels of dysregulated eating ob-
served in this sample were moderate. Nevertheless, the variability
within the sample is clearly meaningful in regards to underlying
neurophysiological regulatory processes. Lastly, our study was lim-
ited to women. Women have been shown to have stronger cortisol
responses to naltrexone than men (Roche et al., 2010). Future work
would need to replicate this study in men.
It is currently not clear what increased cortisol responses to
acute opioid blockade indicate about central opioidergic activity
in the context of hedonic eating or among individuals with fea-
tures of food addiction. Based on prior work of this probe and ani-
mal studies showing down-regulation of the opioid system in
response to palatable food (Spangler et al., 2004), we theorized
that greater increases in cortisol release indicates weaker endog-
enous opioidergic activity either as a result of fewer endogenous
opioids available to compete for binding sites with an opioid
antagonist, or a reduction in opioid receptor density resulting in
a more complete blockade of inhibitory inputs to the hypothala-
mus (Roche et al., 2010; Wand et al., 1998). PET studies demon-
strate that greater cortisol responses to naloxone, a non-specific
opioid receptor antagonist, are associated with lower l- and d-
opioid-receptor binding potential in several brain regions (includ-
ing the hypothalamus) among healthy controls, but not among
acutely abstinent alcohol-dependent participants (Wand et al.,
2011, 2012). While we may have expected that cortisol responses
would be positively associated with opioid receptor binding po-
tential, it is not clear what PET studies of binding potential indi-
cate, as lower binding potential may reflect increased endogenous
opioid release, down-regulation of receptors, or loss of neurons
with opioid receptors (Sprenger, Berthele, Platzer, Boecker, &
Tolle, 2005). A consistent pattern of findings of cortisol responses
to acute opioid blockade in alcohol addiction have not been ob-
served either. Specifically, cortisol response to opioid antagonists
are higher in those at risk for alcoholism based on a positive fam-
ily history (King et al., 2002a; Wand, Mangold, Ali, & Giggey,
1999; Wand, McCaul, Gotjen, Reynolds, & Lee, 2001; Wand
et al., 1998), but not all have found this association (Lovallo
et al., 2012). Furthermore, among alcohol-dependent participants
HPA activity appears to be blunted compared to controls (Inder
et al., 1995; Kemper et al., 1990) although not in all studies
(Wand et al., 2012). Thus, the significance of what cortisol re-
sponses to opioid antagonists indicates about opioid signaling
within and across addictions is not clear.
To gain a better understanding of these mechanisms, future re-
search could examine naltrexone-induced cortisol and nausea re-
sponses in relation to PET assessments of opioid receptor binding
potential in individuals with high levels of adiposity or hedonic
eating or features of food addiction and controls. These responses
could also be examined in relation to variations in genes that
regulate
opioid receptors.
Some evidence suggests
that the
opioid-receptor polymorphism A118G predicts cortisol responses
to naloxone (Chong et al., 2006).
In summary, individuals with high levels of hedonic-related
eating, including emotional, restrained and binge eating, may have
a down-regulated opioidergic system. Results of the present study
suggest that opioid tone can be measured in a relatively unobtru-
sive way, at home, in overweight and obese adults. Although these
findings need to be replicated, this study suggests that cortisol and
nausea responses to acute opioid blockade may serve as biomark-
ers of hedonic-related eating and potentially food addiction.
