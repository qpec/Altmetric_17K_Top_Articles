Abstract
Aims/hypothesis We examined the association between sitting
time and diabetes incidence, overall and by strata of leisure-
time physical activity and BMI.
Methods We followed 28,051 adult participants of the Nord-
Trøndelag Health Study (the HUNT Study), a population-
based study, for diabetes incidence from 1995–1997 to
2006–2008 and estimated HRs of any diabetes by categories
of self-reported total daily sitting time at baseline.
Results Of 28,051 participants, 1253 (4.5%) developed dia-
betes during 11 years of follow-up. Overall, sitting ≥8 h/day
was associated with a 17% (95% CI 2, 34) higher risk of
developing diabetes compared with sitting ≤4 h/day, adjusted
for age, sex and education. However, the association was at-
tenuated to a non-significant 9% (95% CI −5, 26) increase in
risk after adjustment for leisure-time physical activity and
BMI. The association between sitting time and diabetes risk
differed by leisure-time physical activity (pInteraction=0.01).
Among participants with low leisure-time physical activity
(≤2 h light activity per week and no vigorous activity), sitting
5–7 h/day and ≥8 h/day were associated with a 26% (95% CI
2, 57) and 30% (95% CI 5, 61) higher risk of diabetes, respec-
tively, compared with sitting ≤4 h/day. There was no corre-
sponding association among participants with high leisure-
time physical activity (≥3 h light activity or >0 h vigorous
activity per week). There was no statistical evidence that the
association between sitting time and diabetes risk differed by
obesity (pInteraction=0.65).
Conclusions/interpretation Our findings suggest that total sit-
ting time has little association with diabetes risk in the popu-
lation as a whole, but prolonged sitting may contribute to an
increased diabetes risk among physically inactive people.

Introduction
The global epidemic of diabetes requires preventive actions at
a population level. Although low physical activity levels are a
recognised risk factor for diabetes, recent interest has focused
on specific sedentary behaviours (‘too much sitting’) [1].
Sedentary behaviours comprise prolonged sitting in different
settings (at home, at work, watching television and in cars) but
are quite distinct from the risk of physical inactivity, which
refers to not meeting recommended physical activity guide-
lines. Sitting time is of interest in diabetes, given the experi-
mental and physiological evidence that prolonged and

 uninterrupted sitting is adversely related to glucose levels and
insulin resistance [1].
Epidemiological studies initially showed associations be-
tween prolonged television time and increased type 2 diabetes
incidence [2–4], with a meta-analysis indicating that the risk
of type 2 diabetes increased by 20% for each 2 h of television
watched per day [3]. Since television time, the most common
form of sitting in the domestic setting, is associated with the
diabetes risk factors of snacking and other unhealthy dietary
habits and low socioeconomic status [4, 5], it is important to
consider other dimensions of sitting exposure to assess the
independence of any observed epidemiological risk.
Emerging studies examining ‘total sitting time’ and diabetes
have failed to find the same relationships as the early studies
of television time. Evidence from a Danish 5 year prospective
study suggests that the association of total sitting time with
risk of any diabetes seems to be attenuated by physical activity
and among non-obese individuals, leaving residual risk for
developing diabetes among those who are inactive or obese
[6]. In an 11 year follow-up of the Nord-Trøndelag Health
Study (the HUNT Study) in Norway, we aimed to investigate
the association between total sitting time and the risk of any
diabetes, and to examine whether this association was modi-
fied by leisure-time physical inactivity or obesity.
Methods
The HUNT Study is a population-based study in Nord-
Trøndelag county, Norway, with three waves of data collec-
tion: HUNT1 (1984–1986), HUNT2 (1995–1997) and
HUNT3 (2006–2008). At each survey, all residents aged
≥20 years were invited to participate, and participants com-
pleted extensive health-related questionnaires and underwent
a clinical examination and random blood sampling, as de-
scribed previously [7] and on the HUNT website (www.
ntnu.edu/hunt, accessed 20 November 2016). The present
study uses the HUNT2 Survey as the baseline risk factor
examination and the HUNT3 Survey 11 years later as the
follow-up examination to assess diabetes incidence.
In HUNT2, 93,898 people were invited and 65,229 (69%)
participated. On a questionnaire that was returned at the clin-
ical examination, participants reported whether they had ever
been diagnosed with diabetes, their highest education and
their weekly average of leisure-time physical activity during
the last year, categorised separately for light (not sweaty or
breathless) and vigorous activity (sweaty or breathless) as no,
<1, 1–2 or ≥3 h/week. A second questionnaire was given to all
participants at the clinical examination and returned by 55,376
(85%) by mail in a pre-paid envelope; this included a question
on sitting time: ‘How many hours do you usually spend in the
sitting position during a 24 hour period? (work, meals, televi-
sion, car etc.)’. The clinical examination included standardised
measurements of weight and height. Random serum glucose
concentrations were measured using an enzymatic hexokinase
method on a Hitachi 911 Autoanalyzer at Levanger Hospital,
Nord-Trøndelag Hospital Trust.
In HUNT3, all participants were asked whether they had
ever been diagnosed with diabetes and their age at diagnosis,
and random serum glucose was measured in all participants.
All participants had their FINDRISC (Finnish diabetes risk
score) diabetes prediction score calculated, and participants
with a FINDRISC ≥15 out of 26 were invited to have fasting
serum glucose, 120 min 75 g OGTT and HbA1c measure-
ments, as previously described [8].
The validity of self-reported diabetes in this population was
examined after the HUNT1 Survey by comparison with gen-
eral practitioners’ records, and the self-report had excellent
positive (96%) and negative (99.7%) predictive values. Self-
reported diabetes duration was on average 0.4 years longer
than physician-verified duration [9]. Assessing the validity
of self-reported long-term physical activity and sitting habits
is difficult because of the lack of a true reference standard.
However, the HUNT2 questionnaire item on vigorous leisure-
time physical activity correlated moderately with
˙
VO2max
(r=0.46) and time spent in vigorous activity with metabolic
equivalent values ≥6 as measured during a 1 week ActiReg
position-and-movement monitoring (r=0.31), whereas weak-
er or no correlations were observed for self-report of light
leisure-time physical activity [10]. Validity of self-reported
sitting time has not been examined in the HUNT Study, but
the similar International Physical Activity Questionnaire
(IPAQ) item on sitting time correlated moderately (r ~0.3)
with accelerometer counts depicting sedentary behaviour [11].
Among 65,229 participants in HUNT2, we excluded 10,777
individuals aged ≥70 years, as few attended HUNT3 11 years
later. Further, we excluded 1024 individuals with previously
known diabetes, 144 with probable diabetes at HUNT2 indicated
by random serum glucose ≥11.1 mmol/l, 8617 who did not
return the second questionnaire with details on sitting time,
3006 who returned the second questionnaire but did not report
sitting time, 56 who did not answer whether they had diabetes
and 780 individuals with missing information on education level,
leaving 40,825 participants eligible for follow-up. Among them,
28,051 (69%) attended the follow-up examination at HUNT3
11 years later and were included in our analyses.
Diabetes at HUNT3 was indicated by self-reported diagno-
sis, random serum glucose ≥11.1 mmol/l or, in participants who
attended the additional examination with fasting serum glucose
≥7.0 mmol/l, 120 min serum glucose ≥11.1 mmol/l in the
OGTT or HbA1c ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol), consistent with cut-
off levels recommended by the WHO/International Diabetes
Federation. For people whose diabetes was diagnosed between
HUNT2 and HUNT3, date of diabetes diagnosis was estimated
from the participants’ self-reported age at diagnosis. The medi-
an time from HUNT2 to self-reported time of diagnosis
Diabetologia (2017) 60:830–835
831
 (6.8 years) was assigned to participants who did not self-report
their age at diagnosis (7%). Date of HUNT3 participation was
considered as the date of diagnosis for people whose diabetes
was diagnosed by glucose or HbA1c measurements in HUNT3.
We examined the association between self-reported daily sit-
ting time (≤4, 5–7 or ≥8 h) and the incidence of any diabetes
using Cox proportional hazard models, where participants were
followed up from their date of participation in HUNT2 until their
date of diabetes diagnosis or participation in HUNT3, whichever
occurred first. In a first model, we adjusted for age (by using age
as the time scale), sex and education (<10, 10–12 or >12 years).
We additionally adjusted for baseline levels of BMI (weight in
kg divided by the squared height in m, continuous) and self-
reported weekly leisure-time physical activity (categorised as
no, low [<3 h of light and no vigorous activity], medium [≥3 h
of light or <1 h of vigorous activity] or high [≥1 h of vigorous
activity]), which could either be confounders or proxies for
lifestyle/dietary confounders, or be on the causal pathway be-
tween sitting time and diabetes. Additionally, we examined the
association of sitting time with diabetes risk stratified by leisure-
time physical activity (dichotomised as ≤2 h light and no vigor-
ous activity/week vs ≥3 h light or >0 h vigorous activity) or BMI
(<30.0 vs ≥30.0 kg/m2). We used likelihood ratio tests to exam-
ine whether the association between sitting time and diabetes risk
differed by leisure-time physical activity or BMI.
In a first sensitivity analysis, we refrained from using glucose
and HbA1c measurements at the additional diabetes examination
to classify diabetes at follow-up, as these measurements were
performed among people with FINDRISC ≥15 only. Second,
we additionally adjusted for self-reported chronic mobility im-
pairment and smoking habits at baseline. Third, because preva-
lent, symptomatic but undiagnosed diabetes could have influ-
enced sitting time at baseline, we started follow-up 2 years after
baseline, assuming that symptomatic diabetes would most likely
be detected within this interval. Fourth, because information on
age at diabetes diagnosis was lacking for some individuals, we
examined the association between sitting time and diabetes in-
cidence using logistic regression analysis. Fifth, we examined
the association of sitting time with diabetes stratified by vigor-
ous leisure-time physical activity. Sixth, we examined the asso-
ciation of sitting time with diabetes using finer BMI strata.
Seventh, we examined the association between sitting time as
a continuous variable and diabetes risk. Data were analysed
using Stata version SE 13.1 for Windows (StataCorp LP,
College Station, Texas). The study was approved by the region-
al committee for medical and health research ethics, and all
participants gave written informed consent.
Results
Table 1 shows baseline characteristics (HUNT2, 1995–1997)
for participants who did and did not attend the follow-up
examination (HUNT3, 2006–2008), and for otherwise eligible
participants who were excluded because of missing informa-
tion at baseline. Of 28,051 participants who attended the
follow-up examination, 1253 (4.5%) developed diabetes dur-
ing 309,085 person-years of follow-up. Among them, 925 had
their diabetes diagnosed between HUNT2 and HUNT3, and
328 had a new diagnosis of diabetes indicated by glucose or
HbA1c measurements in HUNT3.
In the total study population, sitting ≥8 h/day was associ-
ated with a 17% (95% CI 2, 34) higher risk of developing
diabetes compared with sitting ≤4 h/day, adjusted for age,
sex and education. However, the association was attenuated
to a non-significant 9% (95% CI −5, 26) increase in risk after
adjustment for BMI and leisure-time physical activity
(Table 2), and this attenuation was largely due to adjustment
for BMI (Table 3). The association did not substantially differ
between women and men (ESM Table 1).
The association between sitting time and diabetes risk differed
by baseline leisure-time physical activity level (pInteraction=0.01).
Among participants with low leisure-time physical activity, sit-
ting 5–7 h/day and ≥8 h/day were associated with a 26% (95%
CI 2, 57) and 30% (95% CI 5, 61) higher risk of diabetes,
respectively, compared with sitting ≤4 h/day. There was no cor-
responding association among participants with high leisure-
time physical activity (Table 2). There was no statistical evidence
that the association between sitting time and diabetes risk dif-
fered by obesity status (pInteraction=0.65; Table 2).
The sensitivity analysis in which glucose and HbA1c mea-
surements at the additional diabetes examination among people
with FINDRISC ≥15 was not used for classifying diabetes at
follow-up, yielded results similar to the main analysis (ESM
Table 2). Adjustment for self-reported chronic mobility impair-
ment (ESM Table 3) or smoking habits (ESM Table 4) had
minimal influence on the estimates. Results similar to the main
analyses were obtained when we started follow-up 2 years after
baseline (ESM Table 5), analysed the association between sitting
time and diabetes using logistic regression analysis (ESM
Table 6), stratified by vigorous leisure-time physical activity
(ESM Table 7) and by finer BMI strata (ESM Table 8), and
analysed sitting time as a continuous variable (ESM Table 9).
Discussion
In this longitudinal population-based study, there was little
association between total daily sitting time and diabetes risk
in the population as a whole; sitting ≥8 h/day was associated
with a modest 17% risk increase for diabetes that was substan-
tially attenuated after adjustment for BMI. However, among
participants with little leisure-time physical activity, sitting
≥5 h/day was associated with a significant ~30% increased
incidence of diabetes.

 The strengths of this study include the population-based lon-
gitudinal design with an 11 year follow-up, large sample size and
reasonable response rates. Key baseline characteristics were sim-
ilar between participants and non-participants of the follow-up
examination, which reduces the potential for bias due to loss of
follow-up. The self-report of sitting time may be less accurate
than objective measures [11] and lead to conservative estimates
of the association between sitting and diabetes. A recent cross-
sectional study reported an association between sedentary time
measured using an accelerometer and prevalent type 2 diabetes
[12], but longitudinal studies of objectively measured sitting time
and diabetes incidence are lacking. Our results remained similar
when the additional measurements from people with FINDRISC
≥15 were not used for classifying diabetes, and the lack of sys-
tematic testing for diabetes among participants with FINDRISC
<15 is unlikely to explain the observed associations. We cannot
exclude residual confounding, e.g. from dietary habits such as
snacking. The relationship between sitting and BMI is plausibly
bidirectional, and it is uncertain whether results with or without
BMI adjustment are the most valid estimates of a causal associ-
ation between sitting and diabetes risk.
Our findings suggest that total sitting time has a less pro-
nounced relationship to diabetes incidence compared with earlier
studies using television time as a proxy measure for sitting time.
Consistent with our results, television time was more strongly
than other types of sitting associated with type 2 diabetes inci-
dence in a 6 year follow-up of the Nurses’ Health Study [4].
Also, a Danish cohort study observed a moderate 35% risk in-
crease of any diabetes associated with total sitting ≥10 h/day
compared with <6 h/day, but the association was largely attenu-
ated after adjustment for physical activity and BMI [6].
Although sitting time appears to be of little independent
importance for diabetes incidence in the population as a whole,
prolonged sitting time may contribute to diabetes risk in

 subgroups of the population. The Danish cohort study sug-
gested that sedentary time is associated with increased diabetes
risk among inactive or obese people [6]. Our results are also
consistent with those of meta-analyses of sedentary time and
all-cause mortality, which indicate that prolonged sitting may
have adverse effects particularly among inactive people [2, 13].

 In conclusion, the results of this longitudinal population-
based study suggest that total daily sitting time has little asso-
ciation with the risk of any diabetes in the population as a
whole, but prolonged sitting time may contribute to increased
diabetes risk among physically inactive people.
