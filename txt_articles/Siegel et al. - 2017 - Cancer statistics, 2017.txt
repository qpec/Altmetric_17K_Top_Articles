 Cancer Statistics, 2017

Abstract:
Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new can-
cer cases and deaths that will occur in the United States in the current year and com-
piles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival. Incidence data
were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the National
Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer
Registries. Mortality data were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In
2017, 1,688,780 new cancer cases and 600,920 cancer deaths are projected to occur
in the United States. For all sites combined, the cancer incidence rate is 20% higher in
men than in women, while the cancer death rate is 40% higher. However, sex disparities
vary by cancer type. For example, thyroid cancer incidence rates are 3-fold higher in
women than in men (21 vs 7 per 100,000 population), despite equivalent death rates
(0.5 per 100,000 population), largely reflecting sex differences in the “epidemic of diag-
nosis.” Over the past decade of available data, the overall cancer incidence rate (2004-
2013) was stable in women and declined by approximately 2% annually in men, while the
cancer death rate (2005-2014) declined by about 1.5% annually in both men and women.
From 1991 to 2014, the overall cancer death rate dropped 25%, translating to approxi-
mately 2,143,200 fewer cancer deaths than would have been expected if death rates
had remained at their peak. Although the cancer death rate was 15% higher in blacks
than in whites in 2014, increasing access to care as a result of the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act may expedite the narrowing racial gap; from 2010 to 2015, the
proportion of blacks who were uninsured halved, from 21% to 11%, as it did for Hispanics
(31% to 16%). Gains in coverage for traditionally underserved Americans will facilitate the
broader application of existing cancer control knowledge across every segment of the
population. CA Cancer J Clin 2017;67:7–30. V

Introduction
Cancer is a major public health problem worldwide and is the second leading cause of
death in the United States. In this article, we provide the expected numbers of new
cancer cases and deaths in 2017 in the United States nationally and for each state, as
well as a comprehensive overview of cancer incidence, mortality, and survival rates and
trends using population-based data. The most current cancer data are available
through 2013 for incidence and through 2014 for mortality. We also estimate the total
number of deaths averted as a result of the continual decline in cancer death rates since
the early 1990s. In addition, we present the actual number of deaths reported in 2014
by age for the 10 leading causes of death and for the 5 leading causes of cancer death.
Materials and Methods
Incidence and Mortality Data
Mortality data from 1930 to 2014 were provided by the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS).1-3 Forty-seven states and the District of Columbia met
data quality requirements for reporting to the national vital statistics system in
1930. Texas, Alaska, and Hawaii began reporting mortality data in 1933, 1959,
and 1960, respectively. The methods for abstraction and age adjustment of mortal-
ity data are described elsewhere.3,4
Population-based cancer incidence data in the United States have been collected
by the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI’s) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End

*Rounded to the nearest 10; cases exclude basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers and in situ carcinoma except urinary bladder.
About 63,410 cases of carcinoma in situ of the female breast and 74,680 cases of melanoma in situ will be newly diagnosed in 2017.
†Deaths for colon and rectum cancers are combined because a large number of deaths from rectal cancer are misclassified as colon.
‡More deaths than cases may reflect lack of specificity in recording underlying cause of death on death certificates and/or an undercount in the case
estimate.

 Results (SEER) Program since 1973 and by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) National Pro-
gram of Cancer Registries (NPCR) since 1995. The SEER
program is the only source for long-term population-based
incidence data. Long-term incidence and survival trends
(1975-2013) were based on data from the 9 oldest SEER
areas (Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, Utah, and
the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Detroit, San Francisco-
Oakland, and Seattle-Puget Sound), representing approxi-
mately 9% of the US population.5,6 The lifetime probability
of developing cancer, stage distribution, and survival by stage
and for children and adolescents were based on data from all
18 SEER registries (the SEER 9 registries plus Alaska
Natives, California, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, and New
Jersey), covering 28% of the US population.7 The probability
of developing cancer was calculated using NCI’s DevCan
software (version 6.7.4).8 Some of the statistical information
presented herein was adapted from data previously published
in the SEER Cancer Statistics Review 1975-2013.9
NAACCR compiles and reports incidence data from
1995 onward for cancer registries that participate in the
SEER program and/or the NPCR. These data approach
100% coverage of the US population in the most recent time
period and were the source for the projected new cancer cases
in 2017 and incidence rates by state and race/ethnicity.10,11
Some of the incidence data presented herein were previously
published in volumes 1 and 2 of Cancer in North America:
2009-2013.12,13
All cancer cases were classified according to the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases for Oncology except childhood
and adolescent cancers, which were classified according to
the International Classification of Childhood Cancer
(ICCC).14,15 Causes of death were classified according to
the International Classification of Diseases.16 All incidence

 and death rates were age-standardized to the 2000 US stan-
dard population and expressed per 100,000 population, as
calculated by NCI’s SEER*Stat software (version 8.3.2).17
The annual percent change in rates was quantified using
NCI’s Joinpoint Regression Program (version 4.3.1.0).18
Whenever possible, cancer incidence rates presented in this
report were adjusted for delays in reporting, which occur
because of a lag in case capture or data corrections. Delay
adjustment has the largest effect on the most recent years of
data for cancers that are frequently diagnosed in outpatient
settings (eg, melanoma, leukemia, and prostate cancer) and
provides a more accurate portrayal of the cancer burden in the
most recent time period.19 For example, the leukemia incidence
rate for 2013 is 14% higher after adjusting for reporting
delays.20
Projected Cancer Cases and Deaths in 2017
The most recent year for which incidence and mortality data
are available lags 2 to 4 years behind the current year due to
the time required for data collection, compilation, quality
control, and dissemination. Therefore, we projected the
numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States
in 2017 to provide an estimate of the contemporary cancer
burden. The number of invasive cancer cases was estimated
using a 3-step spatio-temporal model based on high-quality
incidence data from 49 states and the District of Columbia
representing approximately 95% population coverage (data
were lacking for all years for Minnesota and for some years
for other states). First, complete incidence counts were esti-
mated for each county (or health service area for rare cancers)
from 1999 through 2013 using geographic variations in soci-
odemographic and lifestyle factors, medical settings, and
cancer screening behaviors as predictors of incidence.21 Then
these counts were adjusted for delays in cancer reporting
using registry-specific or combined NAACCR delay ratios
and aggregated to obtain national- and state-level counts for
each year. Finally, a temporal projection method (the vector
autoregressive model) was applied to all 15 years of data to
estimate counts for 2017. This method cannot estimate
numbers of basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers because
data on the occurrence of these cancers are not required to
be reported to cancer registries. For complete details of the
case projection methodology, please refer to Zhu et al.22
New cases of female breast carcinoma in situ and melano-
ma in situ diagnosed in 2017 were estimated by first approxi-
mating the number of cases occurring annually from 2004
through 2013 based on age-specific NAACCR incidence
rates (data from 46 states and the District of Columbia with
high-quality data every year) and US population estimates
provided in SEER*Stat. The average annual percent change
in case counts from 2004 through 2013 generated by the
joinpoint regression model was then used to project cases to
2017. The estimates for in situ cases were not adjusted for
reporting delays.
The number of cancer deaths expected to occur in 2017
was estimated
based on the most recent joinpoint-
generated annual percent change in reported numbers of
cancer deaths from 2000 through 2014 at the state and
national levels as reported to the NCHS. For the complete
details of this methodology, please refer to Chen et al.23
Other Statistics
The number of cancer deaths averted in men and women
due to the reduction in overall cancer death rates was
estimated by subtracting the number of recorded deaths
from the number that would have been expected if cancer
death rates had remained at their peak. The expected
number of deaths was estimated by applying the 5-year
age-specific cancer death rates in the peak year for age-
standardized cancer death rates (1990 in men and 1991
in women) to the corresponding age-specific populations
in
subsequent
years
through
2014.
The
difference
between the number of expected and recorded cancer
deaths in each age group and calendar year was then
summed.
Selected Findings
Expected Numbers of New Cancer Cases
Table 1 presents the estimated numbers of new cases of
invasive cancer expected in the United States in 2017 by
sex. The overall estimate of 1,688,780 cases is the equiva-
lent of more than 4,600 new cancer diagnoses each day.
FIGURE 2. Trends in Cancer Incidence (1975 to 2013) and
Death Rates (1975 to 2014) by Sex, United States.
Rates are age adjusted to the 2000 US standard population. Incidence rates
also are adjusted for delays in reporting.

 In addition, about 63,410 cases of female breast carcinoma
in situ and 74,680 cases of melanoma in situ are expected
to be diagnosed in 2017. The estimated numbers of
new cases by state for selected cancer sites are shown in
Table 2.
Figure 1 depicts the most common cancers expected to
occur in men and women in 2017. Prostate, lung and bron-
chus, and colorectal cancers account for 42% of all cases in
men, with prostate cancer alone accounting for almost 1 in
5 new diagnoses. For women, the 3 most commonly diag-
nosed cancers are breast, lung and bronchus, and colorec-
tum, which collectively represent one-half of all cases;
breast cancer alone is expected to account for 30% of all
new cancer diagnoses in women.
Expected Numbers of Cancer Deaths
An estimated 600,920 Americans will die from cancer in
2017, corresponding to about 1,650 deaths per day
(Table 1). The most common causes of cancer death are
cancers of the lung and bronchus, colorectum, and pros-
tate in men and lung and bronchus, breast, and colorec-
tum in women (Fig. 1). These 4 cancers account for 46%
of all cancer deaths, with more than one-quarter (26%)
due to lung cancer. Table 3 provides the estimated
numbers of cancer deaths in 2017 by state for selected
cancer sites.
Trends in Cancer Incidence
Figure 2 illustrates long-term trends in cancer incidence
rates for all cancers combined by sex. Cancer incidence pat-
terns reflect trends in behaviors associated with cancer risk
and changes in medical practice, such as the introduction of
screening. The volatility in incidence for males compared
with females reflects rapid changes in prostate cancer inci-
dence, which spiked in the late 1980s and early 1990s
(Fig. 3) due to a surge in the detection of asymptomatic
disease as a result of widespread prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) testing.24 Over the past decade of data, the overall
cancer incidence rate in men declined by about 2% per year,
with the pace accelerating in more recent years (Table 4).
This trend reflects large continuing declines for cancers of
the lung and colorectum, in addition to a sharp reduction
in prostate cancer incidence of more than 10% annually
from 2010 to 2013. This drop is attributed to decreased
PSA testing in the wake of US Preventive Services Task
Force recommendations against routine use of the test to
screen for prostate cancer because of growing concerns
about overdiagnosis and overtreatment.25,26 The effect of
reduced screening on the occurrence of advanced disease is
being watched closely. Incidence rates for distant stage dis-
ease, which accounted for 4% of diagnoses during 2006 to
2012 (Fig. 4), have been stable since the mid-2000s follow-
ing at least a decade of decline.6

 The overall incidence rate in women has remained gen-
erally stable since 1987 because declines in lung and colo-
rectal cancers are being offset by increasing or stable rates
for breast, uterine corpus, and thyroid cancers and for
melanoma (Table 4). The slight increase in breast cancer
incidence from 2004 to 2013 is driven wholly by nonwhite
women; rates increased by about 2% per year among wom-
en other than white or black and by 0.5% per year among
black women, while remaining stable among white
women.6
Lung cancer incidence rates continue to decline about
twice as fast in men as in women (Table 4). Sex differences in
lung cancer trends reflect historical differences in tobacco use.
Women took up smoking in large numbers later and at older
ages than men, but were also slower to quit, including recent
upturns in smoking prevalence in some birth cohorts.27,28 In
contrast, incidence patterns for colorectal cancer are very sim-
ilar in men and women, with rates declining by 3% per year
from 2004 through 2013 (Table 4). While declines in colo-
rectal cancer incidence rates prior to 2000 are attributed
equally to changes in risk factors and the introduction of
screening,29 recent rapid declines are thought to primarily
reflect the increased uptake of colonoscopy and the removal
of precancerous adenomatous polyps.30,31 Colonoscopy use
among adults aged 50 years and older has tripled, from 21%
in 2000 to 60% in 2015.32 In contrast to the rapid declines in
colorectal cancer incidence among screening aged adults, rates
increased by about 2% per year from 1993 to 2013 in individ-
uals aged younger than 50 years.6
Incidence rates continue to increase rapidly for liver
cancer, by about 3% per year in women and 4% per year in
men, although rates have begun to decline in adults aged
younger than 50 years.25 Similarly, the long-term, rapid
rise in melanoma incidence appears to be slowing, partic-
ularly among younger age groups. Incidence rates for thy-
roid cancer also appear to have begun stabilizing in recent
years after changes in clinical practice guidelines were ini-
tiated in 2009, including more conservative indications
for
biopsy,
following
increased
awareness
of
the
“epidemic in diagnosis.”33 In an effort to further reduce
overdiagnosis and overtreatment, an international panel
of experts convened by the NCI recently proposed down-
grading the terminology for a common subtype of thyroid
cancer from encapsulated follicular variant of papillary
thyroid carcinoma to noninvasive follicular thyroid neo-

 recurrence rate of <1% at 15 years when removed with
limited surgery (ie, thyroid lobectomy).
Trends in Cancer Survival
Over the past 3 decades, the 5-year relative survival rate for
all cancers combined has increased 20 percentage points
among whites and 24 percentage points among blacks.
Improvements in survival for the most common cancers
have been similar by sex, but are much more pronounced
among patients aged 50 to 64 years than among those aged
older than 65 years,35 likely reflecting lower efficacy or use
of new therapies in the elderly population. Progress has
been most rapid for hematopoietic and lymphoid malignan-
cies due to improvements in treatment protocols, including
the discovery of targeted therapies. For example, compar-
ing patients diagnosed in the mid-1970s with those diag-
nosed during 2006 to 2012, the 5-year relative survival
rate has increased from 41% to 71% for acute lymphocytic
leukemia and from 22% to 66% for chronic myeloid leuke-
mia.9 Most patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who
are treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors experience near
normal life expectancy, particularly those diagnosed before
age 65 years, based on a recent review of clinical trial
data.36 Although historical groupings of lymphoid malig-
nancies are still used to track progress, they do not reflect
the substantial biologic variation by subtype that is cap-
tured by the more contemporary World Health Organiza-
tion classification system.37
In contrast to the steady increase in survival for most can-
cers, advances have been slow for lung and pancreatic cancers,
for which the 5-year relative survival is currently 18% and 8%,
respectively (Fig. 5). These low rates are partly because more
than one-half of cases are diagnosed at a distant stage (Fig. 4),
for which the 5-year survival is 4% and 3%, respectively.
There is potential for lung cancer to be diagnosed at an earlier
stage through the use of screening with low-dose computed
tomography, which has been shown to reduce lung cancer
mortality by up to 20% among current and former smokers
with a smoking history of 30 or more pack-years.38,39 Howev-
er, only 2% to 4% of the 8.7 million Americans eligible for
screening reported undergoing a computed tomography scan
of the chest to check for lung cancer in 2010.40

 Trends in Cancer Mortality
The overall cancer death rate rose during most of the 20th
century, largely driven by rapid increases in lung cancer
deaths among men as a consequence of the tobacco epi-
demic, but has declined by about 1.5% per year since the
early 1990s. From its peak of 215.1 (per 100,000 popula-
tion) in 1991, the cancer death rate dropped 25% to 161.2
in 2014. This decline, which is larger in men (31% since
1990) than in women (21% since 1991), translates into
approximately 2,143,200 fewer cancer deaths (1,484,000 in
men and 659,200 in women) than what would have
occurred if peak rates had persisted (Fig. 6).
The decline in cancer mortality over the past 2 decades is
the result of steady reductions in smoking and advances in
early detection and treatment, reflected in considerable
decreases for the 4 major cancers (lung, breast, prostate, and
colorectum) (Fig. 7). Specifically, the death rate dropped 38%
from 1989 to 2014 for female breast cancer, 51% from 1993
to 2014 for prostate cancer, and 51% from 1976 to 2014 for
colorectal cancer. Lung cancer death rates declined 43% from
1990 to 2014 among males and 17% from 2002 to 2014
among females due to reduced tobacco use because of
increased awareness of the health hazards of smoking and
the implementation of comprehensive tobacco control.41
FIGURE 7. Trends in Death Rates by Sex Overall and for Select Cancers, United States, 1930 to 2014.
Rates are age adjusted to the 2000 US standard population. Due to improvements in International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding over time, numerator
data for cancers of the lung and bronchus, colon and rectum, liver, and uterus differ from the contemporary time period. For example, rates for lung and bron-
chus include pleura, trachea, mediastinum, and other respiratory organs.
Cancer Statistics, 2017

CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians
 Tobacco control efforts adopted in the wake of the first Sur-
geon General’s report on smoking and health in 1964 have
resulted in an estimated 8 million fewer premature smoking-
related deaths, one-third of which are due to cancer.42,43
Despite this progress, in much of the Southern United States,
40% of cancer deaths in men in 2014 were caused by
smoking.44
In contrast to declining trends for the 4 major cancers,
death rates rose from 2010 to 2014 by almost 3% per year for
liver cancer and by about 2% per year for uterine cancer (Table
5). Pancreatic cancer death rates continued to increase slightly
(by 0.3% per year) in men but have leveled off in women.
Recorded Number of Deaths in 2014
A total of 2,626,418 deaths were recorded in the United
States in 2014, 23% of which were from cancer (Table 6).
Cancer is the second leading cause of death following heart
disease. However, it is the leading cause of death in 22
states,45 and in Hispanic and Asian Americans.46,47 Cancer
is also the leading cause of death among women aged 40 to
79 years and among men aged 45 to 79 years when data are
analyzed by 5-year age group.1
Table 7 presents the number of deaths in 2014 for the 5
leading cancer types by age and sex. The leading causes of
cancer death are brain cancer, leukemia, and female breast
cancer before age 40 years and lung cancer in those aged 40
years or older. In 2013, lung cancer surpassed breast cancer as
the leading cause of cancer death among women aged 40 to
59 years. Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of cancer
death in women aged 20 to 39 years, underscoring the need to
improve screening rates in this age group, as well as increase
acceptance of and access to human papillomavirus vaccination.
In 2014, only 40% of females aged 13 to 17 years had com-
pleted the 3-dose series, up slightly from 37% in 2013.48
Cancer Disparities by Sex
The lifetime probability of being diagnosed with invasive
cancer is slightly higher for men (40.8%) than for women
(37.5%) (Table 8). Reasons for the increased susceptibility in
men are not well understood, but to some extent reflect differ-
ences in environmental exposures, endogenous hormones,
and probably complex interactions between these influences.
Adult height, which is determined by genetics and childhood
nutrition, is positively associated with cancer incidence and
death in both men and women,49 and has been estimated to
account for one-third of the gender disparity in cancer risk.50
Table 9 shows sex differences in cancer-specific incidence
and mortality. Overall, incidence rates are about 20%
higher in men while mortality rates are about 40% higher.
The larger disparity for mortality reflects differences in the
composition and distribution of cancers. For example, rates
of liver cancer, which is highly fatal, are 3 times higher in
men than in women. The largest sex disparities are for can-
cers of the esophagus, larynx, and bladder, for which

 incidence and death rates are about 4-fold higher in men.
However, incidence rates are higher in women for cancers
of the anus, gallbladder, and thyroid. Notably, thyroid can-
cer incidence rates are 3 times higher in women than in
men (21 vs 7 per 100,000 population), despite equivalent
death rates (0.5 per 100,000 population). This pattern is
indicative of a preponderance of nonfatal thyroid tumors in
women, which is consistent with more prominent and pro-
longed overdiagnosis in women than in men.51 However,
consistency in the gender disparity for thyroid cancer glob-
ally and across racial/ethnic groups in the United States
suggests a higher underlying disease burden in women,52
despite unknown etiologic mechanisms.53
Melanoma incidence rates are about 60% higher in men
than in women, while death rates are more than double. The
larger disparity for mortality reflects an earlier stage at diagno-
sis and better stage-specific survival in women than in men.
Sex disparities in melanoma survival, which have also been
observed in Europe and Australia,54,55 partly reflect more unfa-
vorable prognostic indicators (eg, thick tumors, ulceration, and
trunk loci) and an older age at diagnosis in men compared
with women. However, sex is a predictor of survival indepen-
dent of clinicopathologic factors for reasons that remain
unclear.56 While hormonal influences are thought to play a
role, survival is higher and disease progression less likely in
women, regardless of menopausal status, even for patients with
advanced disease.57 A recent study found a survival advantage
for women when melanoma arose de novo (70%–80% of
tumors), but no difference in survival for nevi-associated
tumors, which are associated with better outcomes.58
Cancer Disparities by Race/Ethnicity and
Socioeconomic Status
Cancer incidence and death rates vary considerably between
racial and ethnic groups, with rates generally highest among
blacks and lowest among Asian/Pacific Islanders (APIs)

 (Tables 10 and 11). Importantly, there are considerable dif-
ferences within all of the broadly defined population groups
described here, despite scant data. For example, while overall
cancer incidence rates are 40% lower for API men than non-
Hispanic white men based on aggregated data, rates in
Hawaiians and Samoans are similar to those in non-
Hispanic whites.47 The same is true for Puerto Ricans with-
in the lower risk Hispanic population.
In 2014, the cancer death rate was 15% higher in blacks
than in whites. The racial disparity has been most striking for
men, with the excess risk growing from 20% in 1970 to 47%
in 1990. However, that gap had narrowed to 21% in 2014,
due in part to more rapid declines in smoking-related cancers
in blacks driven by sharper reductions in smoking initiation in
the 1970s and early 1980s.59,60 The racial disparity has
declined similarly in women, from a peak of 20% in 1998 to
13% in 2014. Other than behavioral differences, racial dispar-
ities are caused by unequal access to and use of high-quality
health care, including cancer prevention and early detection,
timely diagnosis, and optimal treatment.61,62 Blacks are more
likely than whites to be diagnosed with cancer at an advanced
stage (Fig. 4), but also have lower stage-specific survival for
most cancer types (Fig. 5). Both stage at diagnosis and survival
are closely aligned with health insurance coverage,63 which is
lower among minorities than non-Hispanic whites. However,
this gap is also narrowing rapidly. As a result of the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, together referred to as
the Affordable Care Act or ACA, 11% of blacks and 7% of
non-Hispanic whites were uninsured in 2015, down from
21% and 12%, respectively, in 2010.64,65 Progress for His-
panics is similar, with the uninsured rate dropping from 31%
in 2010 to 16% in 2015. If maintained, these shifts should
help to expedite progress in reducing socioeconomic dispar-
ities in cancer, as well as other health conditions.
Cancer incidence and death rates among APIs, American
Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs), and Hispanics are lower
than among non-Hispanic whites for the 4 most common
cancers, but higher for cancers associated with infectious
agents (eg, those of the stomach and liver). For example,
liver cancer incidence rates in these populations are double
those in non-Hispanic whites, reflecting a higher preva-
lence of risk factors such as chronic infection with hepatitis
B and/or hepatitis C viruses, obesity, diabetes, and binge
drinking.66 AI/ANs have the highest rates of kidney cancer,
although there is striking geographic variation, most likely
reflecting differences in the prevalence of renal cancer risk
factors such as obesity, smoking, and hypertension.67
Regional Variations in Cancer Rates
Tables 12 and 13 depict average annual cancer incidence and
death rates for selected cancers by state. State variation in can-
cer occurrence reflects differences in medical practice and the
prevalence of risk factors, such as smoking and obesity.

 Geographic disparities often reflect the national distribution
of poverty and access to health care, which have increased
over time and may continue to exacerbate because of differen-
tial state expansion of Medicaid facilitated by the ACA.68-70
The largest geographic variation by far is for lung cancer,
reflecting the large historical and continuing differences in
smoking prevalence among states.41 For example, lung cancer
incidence rates in Kentucky (118 per 100,000 population in
men and 80 per 100,000 population in women), which has
historically had the highest smoking prevalence, are about 3.5
times higher than those in Utah (34 per 100,000 population
in men and 24 per 100,000 population in women), which

 continues to have the lowest smoking prevalence. Smoking
history similarly predicts state disparities in smoking-
attributable mortality; the proportion of total cancer deaths
caused by smoking is 38% in men and 29% in women in
Kentucky, compared with 22% and 11%, respectively, in
Utah.44 The 2-fold difference for prostate cancer incidence
rates, which range from 84 (per 100,000 population) in
Arizona to 169 in the District of Columbia, reflect state dif-
ferences in PSA testing prevalence and racial composition.24
State variations are smaller for cancers without particularly
strong risk factors or early detection tests (eg, pancreas).
Cancer in Children and Adolescents
Cancer is the second most common cause of death among
children aged 1 to 14 years in the United States, surpassed
only by accidents. In 2017, an estimated 10,270 children
(birth to 14 years) will be diagnosed with cancer (excluding
benign/borderline malignant brain tumors) and 1,190 will die
from the disease. Benign and borderline malignant brain
tumors are not included in the 2017 case estimates because
the calculation method requires historical data and these
tumors were not required to be reported to cancer registries
until 2004.
Leukemias (76% of which are lymphoid leukemias) account
for 29% of all childhood cancers (including benign and bor-
derline malignant brain tumors). Cancers of the brain and
other nervous system are the second most common cancer
type (26%). The third most common category is lymphomas
and reticuloendothelial neoplasms (11%), almost one-half of
which are non-Hodgkin lymphoma (including Burkitt lym-
phoma) and more than one-quarter of which are Hodgkin
lymphoma. Soft tissue sarcomas (almost one-half of which are
rhabdomyosarcoma) and neuroblastoma each account for 6%
of childhood cancers, followed by renal (Wilms) tumors
(5%).10
Cancers in adolescents (aged 15 to 19 years) differ some-
what from those in children in terms of type and distribu-
tion. For example, the most common cancer type in
adolescents is lymphoma (21%), almost two-thirds of which
is Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancers of the brain and other ner-
vous system account for 17% of cases, followed by leukemia
(14%), germ cell and gonadal tumors (12%), and thyroid car-
cinoma (11%). Melanoma accounts for 5% of the cancers
diagnosed in this age group.
Although overall cancer incidence in children and adoles-
cents has been increasing slightly (by 0.6% per year) since
1975, rates appear to have stabilized during the most recent
data years. In contrast, death rates among those aged birth to
19 years have declined continuously, from 6.5 (per 100,000
population) in 1970 to 2.2 in 2014, an overall reduction of
66% (68% in children and 60% in adolescents). The 5-year
relative survival rate for all cancers combined improved from
58% during the mid-1970s to 83% during 2006-2012 for
children and from 68% to 84% for adolescents. However, sur-
vival varies substantially by cancer type and age at diagnosis
(Table 14).
Limitations
Although the estimated numbers of new cancer cases and
deaths expected to occur in 2017 provide a reasonably accu-
rate portrayal of the contemporary cancer burden, they are
model-based, 3-year- or 4-year-ahead projections that
should be interpreted with caution and not be used to
track trends over time. First, the estimates may be affect-
ed by changes in methodology as we take advantage of
improvements in modeling techniques and cancer sur-
veillance coverage. Second, although the model is robust,
it can only account for trends through the most recent
year of data (currently 2013 for incidence and 2014 for
mortality) and cannot anticipate abrupt fluctuations for
cancers affected by changes in detection practice, such as
prostate cancer. Third, the model can be oversensitive to
sudden or large changes in observed data. The most
informative metrics for tracking cancer trends are age-
standardized or age-specific cancer death rates from the

 NCHS and cancer incidence rates from SEER, NPCR,
and/or NAACCR.
Errors in reporting race/ethnicity in medical records and
on death certificates may result in underestimates of cancer
incidence and mortality rates in nonwhite and nonblack
populations. This is particularly relevant for AI/AN popu-
lations. It is also important to note that cancer data in the
United States are primarily reported for broad, heteroge-
neous racial and ethnic groups, masking substantial and
important differences in the cancer burden within these
subpopulations. For example, among API men, lung cancer
incidence rates in Hawaiian men are just as high as those in
non-Hispanic white men and 3-fold higher than those in
Asian Indian/Pakistani men based on limited data available
by population subgroups. Thus, the high burden of lung
and other cancers among Hawaiians is completely con-
cealed with the presentation of aggregated API data.
Conclusions
The continuous decline in cancer death rates over 2 deca-
des has resulted in an overall drop of 25%, resulting in
2.1 million fewer cancer deaths during this time period.
Moreover, racial disparities in cancer death rates are con-
tinuing to decline and the proportion of blacks who are
uninsured has halved since 2010, potentially expediting
further progress. Despite these successes, death rates are
increasing rapidly for cancers of the liver (one of the most
fatal cancers) and uterine corpus, both of which are
strongly associated with obesity. Advancing the fight
against cancer requires continued clinical and basic
research to improve detection practices, as well as treat-
ment. In addition, creative new strategies are also needed
to increase healthy behaviors nationwide and to more
broadly apply existing cancer control knowledge across all
segments of the population, with an emphasis on disad-
vantaged groups. �
