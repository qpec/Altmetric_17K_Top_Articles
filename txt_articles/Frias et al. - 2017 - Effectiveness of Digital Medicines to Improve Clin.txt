Abstract
Background: Hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus are major modifiable risk factors for cardiac, cerebrovascular, and
kidney diseases. Reasons for poor disease control include nonadherence, lack of patient engagement, and therapeutic inertia.
Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the impact on clinic-measured blood pressure (BP) and glycated hemoglobin
(HbA1c) using a digital medicine offering (DMO) that measures medication ingestion adherence, physical activity, and rest using
digital medicines (medication taken with ingestible sensor), wearable sensor patches, and a mobile device app.
Methods: Participants with elevated systolic BP (SBP ≥140 mm Hg) and HbA1c (≥7%) failing antihypertensive (≥2 medications)
and oral diabetes therapy were enrolled in this three-arm, 12-week, cluster-randomized study. Participants used DMO (includes
digital medicines, the wearable sensor patch, and the mobile device app) for 4 or 12 weeks or received usual care based on site
randomization. Providers in the DMO arms could review the DMO data via a Web portal. In all three arms, providers were
instructed to make medical decisions (medication titration, adherence counseling, education, and lifestyle coaching) on all available
clinical information at each visit. Primary outcome was change in SBP at week 4. Other outcomes included change in SBP and
HbA1c at week 12, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at weeks 4 and 12, as
well as proportion of patients at BP goal (<140/90 mm Hg) at weeks 4 and 12, medical decisions, and medication adherence
patterns.
Results: Final analysis included 109 participants (12 sites; age: mean 58.7, SD years; female: 49.5%, 54/109; Hispanic: 45.9%,
50/109; income ≤ US $20,000: 56.9%, 62/109; and ≤ high school education: 52.3%, 57/109). The DMO groups had 80 participants
(7 sites) and usual care had 29 participants (5 sites). At week 4, DMO resulted in a statistically greater SBP reduction than usual
care (mean –21.8, SE 1.5 mm Hg vs mean –12.7, SE 2.8 mmHg; mean difference –9.1, 95% CI –14.0 to –3.3 mm Hg) and
maintained a greater reduction at week 12. The DMO groups had greater reductions in HbA1c, DBP, and LDL-C, and a greater
proportion of participants at BP goal at weeks 4 and 12 compared with usual care. The DMO groups also received more therapeutic
interventions than usual care. Medication adherence was ≥80% while using the DMO. The most common adverse event was a
self-limited rash at the wearable sensor site (12%, 10/82).
Conclusions: For patients failing hypertension and diabetes oral therapy, this DMO, which provides dose-by-dose feedback on
medication ingestion adherence, can help lower BP, HbA1c, and LDL-C, and promote patient engagement and provider decision
making.

Introduction
Hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus are major risk factors
for cardiac diseases, stroke, and kidney diseases [1-5]. Despite
the 
widespread 
availability 
of 
effective 
treatments,
approximately half of treated patients do not have adequate
blood pressure (BP) or glycemic control [4,6,7]. Poor medication
adherence, lack of patient engagement, and therapeutic inertia
are major contributors to patients not reaching their therapeutic
targets [8-12]. Medication nonadherence alone costs US $290
billion annually in the United States and is difficult to assess
and improve [13,14].
The psychology literature suggests that human beings in general
are poor intuitive statisticians in that they cannot estimate their
risk for consequences related to nonadherence and poor disease
control [15]. Proteus Digital Health (Redwood City, CA, USA)
hypothesized that this problem might be addressed by a common
solution: detailed feedback to patients and physicians of actual
dosing behavior. This would present patients with a clear
adherence target while allowing physicians to discern
lack-of-response calling for dosage or medication changes from
patient nonadherence.
Proteus Discover, a digital medicine offering (DMO) from
Proteus Digital Health, was designed specifically to provide
feedback for medication taking and other health behaviors to
both patients and providers. It consists of an ingestible sensor
(contained inside a placebo pill), an adhesive wearable sensor
patch, a patient mobile app, and a provider Web portal. After
being swallowed, the ingestible sensor is activated and sends a
signal with a specific code that is detected by the patch. When
the ingestible sensor pill is taken with medication (now a digital
medicine), the DMO can measure medication ingestion
adherence. To ensure that the ingestible sensor and medication
are taken simultaneously, the two can be co-encapsulated by a
pharmacist (as was done during this study). The patch also
measures activity, body angle, heart rate, and step count. Data
from the patch are transmitted to a mobile device (eg, mobile
phone) and then to the cloud. Patients can visualize the DMO
data on their mobile device via an app and providers can view
summaries of the DMO data for their patients on the Web portal.
The mobile device app also prompts the patient to take their
medication doses as scheduled. The goal of the DMO is to
improve clinical outcomes through better patient self-care,
enhanced patient-provider dialog, and data-driven optimization
of therapy. (See Figure 1 for an overview of the DMO.)
Prior clinical studies demonstrated the accuracy, safety, and
feasibility of using the DMO in patients across a range of
medical conditions, including HTN and type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM), and suggested this DMO can identify reasons for
uncontrolled HTN and help patients achieve BP control [16-21].
However, these uncontrolled studies did not focus on disease
control. A prior hypertension registry study conducted in several
primary care centers in the United Kingdom demonstrated the
ability of a prior version of the DMO with no patient feedback
(ie, digital medicines plus patch) to uncover a root cause for
uncontrolled HTN in all participants after 2 weeks of use.
Additionally, 37% of participants achieved BP control after 2
weeks with no adjustments to their antihypertensive medications
[20].
In this study, patients with uncontrolled T2DM and HTN with
current therapy were offered the DMO or usual care (to compare
with the current standard that patients receive today). The design
of the HTN registry was used to determine the duration of DMO
use in this study; the first 2 weeks of DMO use allowed
providers to understand the root cause for elevated BP
(nonadherence, inadequate medication, or both) and the
subsequent 2 weeks allowed the provider to see the effect of
the medical decision on BP after the first 2 weeks [20]. The
primary objective was to study the effect of the DMO on BP.
Additional objectives were to assess the effect on glycemic and
lipid control, engagement, and provider decision making.

Methods
Study Design and Participants
This 12-week, open-label, prospective, cluster-randomized,
controlled, three-arm pilot study was executed at 13 outpatient
primary care sites across California and Colorado. There were
three additional sites that did not enroll any patients. Sites were
selected based on the size of their HTN and T2DM population.
Use of a cluster-randomized design mitigated the risk of
investigator bias by ensuring providers cared for participants
assigned to only one arm. Sites were randomized to the treatment
arms: DMO use for 4 weeks (4-week DMO), DMO use for 12
weeks (12-week DMO), or usual care. Enrolled participants
were assigned to the treatment arm of their clinical site.
Adults with uncontrolled HTN (systolic BP [SBP] ≥140 mm
Hg) and T2DM (glycated hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] ≥7%) who
failed treatment with two or more antihypertensive medications
available as part of the DMO medicine panel (Table 1) or
dose-equivalent medicines from the same classes, and metformin
and/or a sulfonylurea were eligible for enrollment. Participants
either needed to be able to use a mobile phone or tablet or the
investigator determined the participant could learn to use a smart
mobile device. Investigators also assessed whether their
participants could be treated for HTN during the study period
using the DMO medication panel exclusively; if medically
necessary, participants could be prescribed off-panel
antihypertensive medicines. Exclusion criteria included body
mass index (BMI) >40 kg/m2, skin sensitivity to adhesive
medical tape or metals, active or chronic dermatitis, secondary
causes for uncontrolled HTN or T2DM, evidence of
hypertensive emergency, and use of insulin or other injectables
to treat T2DM within the past year.
Copernicus Group Independent Review Board, a central
institutional review board, approved and monitored the study.
Participants provided written informed consent prior to screening
and were compensated (US $150 to US $525 based on study
arm and site-specific guidelines for participant compensation)
for participation.
During the study, changes were made to make the inclusion and
exclusion criteria less restrictive to promote recruitment.
Notably, we included a Spanish version of the consent form and
removed an exclusion of non-English speakers.
Interventions
Investigators were instructed to make medication changes and
to provide patient education and counseling as clinically
appropriate (versus using specific dose-escalation protocols) to
ensure the decisions were similar to those in a real clinical
practice setting. Blood pressure recorded at each visit was the
mean of two or more BP measurements obtained using the
recommended measurement guidelines from the American Heart
Association [22]. Participants had their BP measured after 5 or
more minutes of rest, comfortably seated in a quiet room with
their feet touching the floor. Each BP measurement was taken
at least 1 minute apart. If the first two BP readings were more
than 5 mm Hg different, then the BP was measured at least two
more times; the mean of all BP values from one visit were used
as the final reading. Laboratory test results were drawn at
screening, and at weeks 4 and 12, for HbA1c (screening and
week 12), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), total cholesterol, and
directly measured low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).

 Participants also completed the 10-question Patient Activation
Measure (PAM), a validated measure of patient activation that
includes person’s beliefs, motivation, and actions for self-care
at these visits [9,23,24]. During each visit, participants and
investigators jointly reviewed the data and collaboratively set
goals for medication adherence, physical activity, and rest.
Participants in the DMO arms were prescribed DMO for either
4 or 12 weeks and medicines co-encapsulated with ingestible
sensors (see digital medicine panel in Table 1). Participants
were allowed to switch to medications on the digital medicine
panel in a dose-equivalent manner from the same drug classes.
The DMO investigators were instructed to review DMO reports
on the Web portal during study visits.

aParticipants could take more than one medication dose at any one time (eg, ingesting two atorvastatin 20 mg capsules to get a total dose of 40 mg).
All investigators could titrate medications, provide patient
education, and/or counseling at any time during the study as
per usual care based on all available clinical data, with the
exception that investigators in the DMO arms were instructed
to await the DMO report from the first 2 weeks of DMO use
before making changes to the antihypertensive medications (or
other medical decision) to try to ensure this decision was made
using the DMO data.
Providers trained participants on use of the DMO and, along
with customer support provided by the sponsor, assisted
participants in troubleshooting issues with the DMO.
Study Outcomes
The primary endpoint was change in SBP from baseline to week
4. Secondary endpoints included changes from baseline in SBP
and HbA1c at week 12, changes in diastolic BP (DBP) and FPG
at weeks 4 and 12, proportion of participants at BP goal (SBP
<140 mm Hg and DBP <90 mm Hg) at weeks 4 and 12,
medication adherence rate, and mean daily step count and
duration of physical activity and rest (DMO only), and medical
decisions. Exploratory outcomes included change in LDL-C
from baseline at weeks 4 and 12 in patients using digital
atorvastatin (DMO arms) or any statin (usual care) and change
in PAM score.
Statistical Analysis
Target enrollment in this pilot study was 120 participants to
ensure at least 90 evaluable participants at the end of the study.
This study was primarily performed to understand the effect
size of the DMO intervention. Although there was prior data
from the hypertension registry study, the product and study
design were different: participants in the hypertension registry
study used a DMO without feedback for 2 weeks. It was
hypothesized that with feedback to the participant and provider
and a longer intervention, the effect size would be larger. Due
to the pilot nature of the study, there were no a priori hypotheses
for this study; P values are not reported on study outcome data.
P values were only calculated for baseline differences between
groups.
Values and change for continuous variables were summarized
descriptively (mean and SE) and 95% confidence intervals (95%
CI) were calculated for all changes. Differences between groups
were calculated using a mixed-effects regression model that
incorporated covariates found to be significant in the model:
baseline value, gender, age (<65 years vs ≥65 years), and race
(African American vs other). Proportions as well as differences
between groups were summarized descriptively.
The SE was adjusted for cluster (study site) effects as well as
the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) calculated using a
one-way analysis of variance to adjust for any imbalances
between and within clusters. Confidence intervals were
calculated for differences between groups.
Participants with at least one follow-up BP were included in
this modified intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, which represented
the minimal data needed for a pre/post comparison for each
participant. Missing data were handled using last observation
carried forward. Safety assessments were performed on all
enrolled participants. Analyses were performed for 4-week
DMO, 12-week DMO, and combined DMO (both DMO arms
combined). Because both DMO groups had the same
intervention for the first 4 weeks, the two groups were combined
for all week 4 endpoints and measures (eg, mean medication
adherence).

lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) for the combined digital medicine offering (DMO) groups at week 4, week-4 DMO, and 12-week DMO. Error bars
represent SE.
Medication adherence data and medical decisions (provider
treatment decisions in response to DMO data) were summarized
descriptively. Medication adherence was calculated only for the
DMO users because measurement of medication adherence was
an intrinsic aspect of the intervention.
Analyses of efficacy variables were performed on R version
3.2.2 with lme4 version 1.1.11 for building generalized linear
mixed models. An interim analysis was performed in October
2015 to get preliminary data on the primary outcome.
Results
Between June and October 2015, 118 participants were enrolled
across the 13 sites; 107 participants completed the week 4 visit
and 105 completed the week 12 visit by December 30, 2015.
Three usual care participants missed the week 4 visit, but were
included in the analysis because they returned for the week 12
visit. One usual care site with five participants was not included
in the final analysis over concern about violation of the cluster
randomization. This usual care site was activated in September
and was joined by the lead study coordinator from a 4-week
DMO site previously activated in May; this study coordinator

 had intervened with both DMO and usual care participants. The
final modified-ITT group included 109 participants (40 in
4-week DMO, 40 in 12-week DMO, and 29 in usual care)
(Figure 2).
The study included a large portion of low-income participants
(56.9%, 62/109 earned ≤ US $20,000 per year) and minorities
(52.3%, 57/109 Hispanics) (Table 2). In addition, 22.0%
(24/109; 25%, [20/80] in DMO and 14%, [4/29] in usual care)
had psychiatric comorbidities.
Primary Outcome
At week 4, combined DMO had a mean change in SBP from
baseline of –21.8 (SE 1.5) mm Hg compared to –12.7 (SE 2.8)
mm Hg for usual care (combined DMO–usual care: mean –9.1,
SE 2.9, 95% CI –14.8 to –3.3 mm Hg; ICC=0; adjusted
difference: mean –10.0, SE 3.1, 95% CI –16.1 to –3.9 mm Hg;
effect size=0.69) (Figure 3). A sensitivity analysis showed that
excluding the one usual care site did not impact the primary
outcome; the change in SBP for usual care with the excluded
site was mean –14.0 (SE 2.7; difference from combined DMO:
–7.8, SE 2.8, 95% CI –13.3 to –2.3 mm Hg).
Secondary Outcomes
Hypertension
At week 4, a greater proportion of DMO participants achieved
their BP goal (81%, 65/80) compared with usual care (33.3%,
9/27; mean difference 47.9%, SE 15.0%, 95% CI 18.5%-77.3%)
(Table 3). DMO participants also had a greater reduction in
DBP compared with usual care, but the results were not
significant. The 12-week DMO group continued to show larger
reductions in SBP from baseline (mean –24.6, SE 1.7 mm Hg),
which was statistically larger compared to usual care (mean
–15.2, SE 2.0 mm Hg; mean difference –9.4, SE 2.7, 95% CI
–14.6 to –4.2 mm Hg). At week 12, 98% (39/40) of 12-week
DMO participants achieved their BP goal compared with 51.7%
of usual care participants (mean difference 45.8%, 95% CI 7.1%
to 84.5%). The 4-week DMO group also had greater reductions
in SBP and DBP at week 12 than usual care, but the results were
not statistically significantly different (Table 4).
Diabetes
At week 12, DMO had a nonsignificant difference in HbA1c
reduction compared to usual care (4-week DMO: mean –0.32%,
SE 0.22%; 12-week DMO: mean –0.08%, SE 0.22%; usual
care: mean 0.28%, SE 0.35%). For participants with a baseline
HbA1c of 8% of more (n=65; 4-week DMO: n=26, 12-week
DMO: n=24, usual care group: n=15), both DMO groups showed
larger HbA1c decreases (4-week DMO: mean –0.72%, SE
0.23%; 12-week DMO: mean –0.31%, SE 0.31%) compared to
an increase in the HbA1c seen in the usual care group (mean
0.26%, SE 0.34%; difference from 4-week DMO 0.98%, 95%
CI –1.72 to –0.24; difference from 12-week DMO –0.57%, 95%
CI –1.53 to 0.39) (See Figure 3 and Table 3). Adjusted
differences for the change in HbA1c between each DMO group
and usual care were almost 1%. There were no significant
differences in change in FPG between the DMO and usual care
groups.

 Figure 4. Ingestion adherence for DMO subjects measured by DMO. Note adherence for the first 4 weeks includes both 4-week DMO and 12-week
DMO; adherence for 12 weeks includes only 12-week DMO.
Medical Decisions
The DMO providers made approximately 3 times more medical
decisions per participant (mean 6.5, SD 5.3 DMO vs mean 2.7,
SD 3.3 usual care). The DMO participants received more
counseling, patient education, and lifestyle coaching than usual
care. The frequency of medication changes per participant was
similar for DMO (mean 0.83, SD 1.49) and usual care (mean
1.00, SD 1.58). At week 4, DMO participants with uncontrolled
BP, who were medication adherent (≥80%), appeared to be 4
times more likely than usual care participants to receive an
antihypertensive titration. Although this suggests that greater
targeting of therapy adjustments may occur in patients who
utilize DMO, this finding should be interpreted with caution
because the actual number of medication changes that occurred
was small and the difference was not statistically significant.
Digital Medicine Offering Measurements
The mean ingestion adherence was 86% during the first 4 weeks
(combined DMO) and 84% for the entire 12 weeks (12-week
DMO) (see Figure 4).
Exploratory Outcomes
Among statin users, reductions in LDL-C were larger for DMO
compared with usual care. These differences were even greater
in participants with a baseline LDL-C of 70 mg/dL or higher.
In participants with baseline LDL-C of 70 mg/dL or higher
(n=54; 4-week DMO: n=6, 12-week DMO: n=28, usual care
group: n=20), changes in LDL-C were mean –37.2 (SE 7.9)
mg/dL at week 4 and mean –30.1 (SE 8.0) mg/dL at week 12
for DMO and mean –4.0 (4.3) mg/dL at week 4 and mean –10.9
(SE 5.9) mg/dL at week 12 for usual care. The differences in
change in LDL-C between DMO and the usual care group were
–33.2 (95% CI –50.6 to –15.8) at week 4 and –19.2 (95% CI
–36.4 to –2.0) at week 12. These differences were statistically
significant (see Table 5 for complete results).
The DMO participants had a nonsignificantly greater increase
in PAM score compared with usual care; the changes were mean
7.9 (SE 3.8) for 4-week DMO, mean 7.9 (SE 3.0) for 12-week
DMO, and mean 1.7 (SE 3.3) for usual care at week 12 (see
Table 6).

Participant Satisfaction With Digital Medicine Offering
In general, participants agreed the DMO was easy to learn (92%,
69/75) and to incorporate in their daily routine (91%, 68/75),
and that using the data was useful to manage (91%, 68/75) and
improved their health (93%, 70/75) and that sharing their data
with their provider helped them to understand their care plan
(91%, 68/75). Most (81%, 61/75) did not mind wearing the
patch (see Table 7).
Safety
There were 32 of 82 DMO participants (39%) who reported 59
adverse events (AEs), of which 33 were unrelated to the DMO;
8 of 36 usual care participants (22%) reported 17 AEs. There
were no serious AEs related to the DMO or the study. There
were 14 device-related AEs in 11 participants, most commonly
mild skin reactions to the wearable sensor (13 events in 10
participants, 12%). Additionally, 12 participants reported study
medication-related AEs (14 events total) with gastrointestinal
AEs (9 events in 8 participants; 7 mild, 2 moderate, 1 moderate
event led to study withdrawal, 10%) being the most common.
Another AE, fatigue (mild intensity), unrelated to the device or
study medication, led to study withdrawal.
Discussion
In this study, participants with uncontrolled HTN and T2DM
who used the DMO had significantly greater reductions in SBP
within 4 weeks than the usual care group (9 mm Hg greater
reduction), which was maintained at 12 weeks with a
significantly greater proportion of patients achieving their BP
goal. Participants using the DMO also showed lower trends in
HbA1c (as much as a 1% greater reduction), and LDL-C (33
mg/dL greater reduction) compared to participants who received
usual clinical care. These clinical findings were maintained in
analyses adjusting for age, gender, race, and baseline clinical
parameters. Use of the DMO was also safe; the frequency of
skin reactions is generally lower than published research on
adhesive tape and patches [25-28].
These findings are relevant in the care of T2DM patients who
have an increased risk of serious cardiovascular and
microvascular complications. Each 2 mm Hg reduction in SBP
or 1 mm Hg reduction in DBP has been associated with lowering
mortality from stroke and ischemic heart disease by 10% and
7%, respectively [29]. A reduction in HbA1c of 0.5% or more
is considered clinically significant to reduce the risk of
microvascular complications [30,31]. Statin adherence, as
evidenced by LDL-C reduction, has also been associated with
improved outcomes in diabetes patients [29,32,33]. However,
given the short duration of this pilot study, additional
longer-term evidence will be necessary to demonstrate that the
changes in BP, HbA1c, and LDL are durable.
We hypothesize that improved clinical outcomes with the DMO
were related in part to improved self-care (medication adherence
and patient activation). In the literature, average adherence to
chronic medicines is approximately 50%; participants using
DMO achieved a mean adherence of 86% during the first 4
weeks. The DMO also had a greater increase in PAM scores; a
1-point increase in PAM score is associated with a 1.8%
increased likelihood of decreasing HbA1c to less than 8% [9].
Providers could make more targeted and timely therapy
optimization decisions using the objective behavioral data
reported by the DMO. We found that at week 4, for participants
with uncontrolled BP, investigators in the DMO arm were more
likely to make therapy adjustments or give adherence counseling
and/or education guided by the DMO data compared to usual
care participants.
Other digital health solutions have failed to demonstrate benefit.
Bloss et al [34] failed to demonstrate benefits of digital health
interventions (telemonitoring devices for BP, blood glucose, or
electrocardiogram rhythm) compared to usual care in a large
controlled study. In that study, no instructions were given to

 providers on use of the device data; this has been shown to make
blood glucose monitoring less effective in non-insulin-using
diabetes patients [30,34]. There were also confounders. For
example, many participants with diabetes in the control arm
used insulin and likely made insulin-titration decisions based
on blood glucose results. Finally, the inclusion criteria were
based on cost versus level of disease control and may have
enrolled participants not needing additional interventions.
In contrast, a recent study demonstrated benefits of a pharmacist
case management intervention to reduce BP using a
telemonitoring BP device [35]. Participants in the intervention
arm spoke with pharmacists (via the phone) who reviewed BP
data, provided coaching, and titrated medications. The
intervention group had a statistically greater reduction in SBP
at 6 months than usual care (mean difference –10.7, 95% CI
–14.3 to –7.3 mm Hg), similar to the reductions in SBP observed
in our pilot study on the DMO, except the pharmacist case
management study only addressed hypertension, whereas this
DMO study evaluated patients with both uncontrolled HTN and
T2DM.
There were several limitations to this study. This study had a
small sample size and included only 13 sites, which likely
contributed to discrepancies noted in participant demographic
and baseline characteristics. As mentioned in the Methods, this
was a pilot study to measure the effect size of the DMO on SBP.
The adjusted analyses suggested that these baseline differences
did not affect the outcomes. However, they may have still
affected the results for BP at goal. The small sample size may
have also contributed to lack of power to detect differences
between groups for some of the secondary and exploratory
outcomes. In order to demonstrate use of the DMO in the
real-world primary care clinic workflow, ambulatory BP
monitoring was not used; therefore, BP fluctuations may be
potentially related to the context of in-clinic measurement
(outside of the participant’s natural context). A comparison of
adherence to treatment was not included among the goals of
this study. No objective assessment of adherence to treatment
was attempted in the usual care arm because there are only
indirect methods of measuring adherence as an alternative to
DMO and none of these methods have been established to be
inherently reliable or accurate. Therefore, we cannot conclude
that DMO led to higher levels of medication adherence.
However, measuring an improvement in adherence was not an
objective of the study.
Despite these limitations, this study demonstrates positive
evidence that a digital health offering that measures and
promotes medication adherence, patient self-care, and provider
engagement can help patients improve their level of BP and
diabetes control. The results should be generalizable given the
diversity of the study population. Reducing BP, HbA1c, and
LDL-C in a consistent manner over a longer term through the
use of DMO-like approaches may help patients decrease their
overall risk for complications. Future real-world evidence can
build on these results to further elucidate longer-term outcomes.
