Introduction
Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessively inherited disor-
der of copper metabolism caused by ATPase copper-transporting β 
 
(ATP7B) gene mutations (1–3). ATP7B is a copper-transport-
ing ATPase that mediates copper excretion into bile (1, 4), and 
its functional loss causes a major impairment of the ability of 
hepatocytes to maintain copper homeostasis at the cellular and 
systemic levels, resulting in persistent copper accumulation in 
the liver. This can lead, most likely as a result of spillover of liver 
copper, to deleterious effects on the brain and, in many cases, to 
chronic liver disease and also to fulminant hepatic failure (1, 5–8).
To restore copper homeostasis, the clinically used copper 
chelators D-penicillamine (D-PA) and trientine (TETA) or the 
candidate drug tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) are administered 
daily (1, 5). This lifelong therapy is effective if commenced 
before the onset of advanced hepatic or neurologic disease 
(6–8). The same holds true for zinc salts, which are primarily 
used in mild cases of WD to decrease copper absorption via the 
gastrointestinal tract or as copper maintenance therapy in chela-
tor-treated WD patients (1, 5, 9). However, in circumstances of 
acute liver failure — caused by delayed diagnosis, treatment fail-
ure, or rapidly developing fulminant hepatitis — death is almost 
certain unless liver transplantation is performed (1, 5, 7, 10, 11). 
Poor treatment compliance may be another reason for the death 
In Wilson disease (WD), functional loss of ATPase copper-transporting β (ATP7B) impairs biliary copper excretion, leading to 
excessive copper accumulation in the liver and fulminant hepatitis. Current US Food and Drug Administration– and European 
Medicines Agency–approved pharmacological treatments usually fail to restore copper homeostasis in patients with WD who 
have progressed to acute liver failure, leaving liver transplantation as the only viable treatment option. Here, we investigated 
the therapeutic utility of methanobactin (MB), a peptide produced by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, which has an 
exceptionally high affinity for copper. We demonstrated that ATP7B-deficient rats recapitulate WD-associated phenotypes, 
including hepatic copper accumulation, liver damage, and mitochondrial impairment. Short-term treatment of these rats 
with MB efficiently reversed mitochondrial impairment and liver damage in the acute stages of liver copper accumulation 
compared with that seen in untreated ATP7B-deficient rats. This beneficial effect was associated with depletion of copper 
from hepatocyte mitochondria. Moreover, MB treatment prevented hepatocyte death, subsequent liver failure, and death in 
the rodent model. These results suggest that MB has potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of acute WD.

Given these issues, there is a clear, unmet medical need for 
alternative and innovative WD treatments. In this regard, 3 recent 
reports merit special attention. First, gene therapy via adeno-as-
sociated viral vectors designed for liver-specific ATP7B expression 
provided long-term correction of copper metabolism in Atp7b–/– 
mice (12). This is an exciting new route for treating patients with 
WD; however, as transgene expression upon vector injection is 
of patients with WD (11). All of the currently Food and Drug 
Administration–approved and European Medicines Agency–
approved copper chelators have adverse effects, including bone 
marrow toxicity, nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, anemia, and 
triggering of autoimmune disease (1, 5, 7). Because of the tox-
icity of D-PA, discontinuation of treatment is required in almost 
one-third of patients with WD (5).

comprises 7 aa plus 2 chromophoric residues (termed OxaA and 
OxaB) forming an N2S2 binding site for a single copper ion (26). 
Methanotrophic proteobacteria have a high copper requirement 
for their copper-dependent methane oxidase (27, 28) and excrete 
MB to sequester extracellular copper (25, 27, 28). MB is permeable 
through the bacterial outer membrane, is reinternalized across the 
cytoplasmic membrane via a TonB transporter (29), and delivers 
copper either to methane oxidases or to storage proteins like cop-
per storage protein 1 (CSP1) (30).
Tested head-to-head with clinically available copper chela-
tion treatments (D-PA or TETA), only MB demonstrated efficacy 
against acute WD in Atp7b–/– rats, meaning that it was able to 
reverse the mitochondrial copper overload within a few days and 
to avoid causing the death of rats with severe signs of liver failure.
Results
Mitochondrial impairment is pathognomonic for hepatic failure in 
patients with WD and for liver damage in Atp7b–/– rats. Complete 
functional loss of ATP7B results in severe WD phenotypes in 
humans (31, 32). The Atp7b–/– rat carries an Atp7b mutation that 
abolishes its hepatic copper transport activity (16, 17). These ani-
mals rapidly progress from a copper-burdened liver to hepatic 
failure and death (18). We therefore compared diseased livers 
from untreated patients with acute WD (who had undergone liver 
transplantation) with livers from Atp7b–/– rats at progressive stages 
of the disease. In addition, livers from patients with WD who had 
received unsuccessful D-PA treatment before transplantation 
were included in this study (Figure 1).
To compare clinical stages of liver impairment, we classified 
rats at ages 80–100 days, when liver damage becomes apparent, 
into 3 groups: (a) rats affected by elevated liver copper levels, with 
serum AST below 200 U/l and bilirubin below 0.5 mg/dl; (b) rats 
showing disease onset, with AST above 200 U/l and bilirubin 
below 0.5 mg/dl; and (c) diseased rats, with AST above 200 U/l 
and bilirubin above 0.5 mg/dl (Table 1).
rather slow, this drawback may hamper its use in acute WD (13). 
A second study reported that the plant-derived decapeptide 
OSIP108 protected against copper-induced cell death in yeast and 
human HepG2 cells. Intriguingly, this positive effect was not due 
to a reduction of cellular copper but rather to effects on sphingo-
lipid homeostasis (14). A third study reported hepatocyte targeting 
and intracellular copper chelation by specifically designed glyco-
cyclopeptides (15). Despite this recent progress involving new 
therapeutic routes in WD, these studies also emphasize the unmet 
need for new medications that especially counteract acute liver 
failure in WD.
We recently described copper-driven fulminant hepatitis in 
LPP Atp7b–/– rats that carry a homozygous 13-kb deletion in the 
Atp7b gene (hereafter referred to as Atp7b–/– rats) (16–18). Because 
of this recessive genetic defect, heterozygous Atp7b+/– rats have a 
normal phenotype. In Atp7b–/– rats, however, accumulating liver 
copper results in WD-like pathology. Clinical manifestations 
include elevated levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) and bilirubin, rapidly followed by liver failure and death 
(18). The early hepatocellular phenotype in these animals is char-
acterized by increased mitochondrial copper accumulation, pro-
voking progressive alterations of their structure (18). A similar 
mitochondrial phenotype has been reported in WD patients and 
in other WD animal models (19–22). In Atp7b–/– rats, mitochon-
drial changes could be reversed by several weeks of treatment 
with copper chelators. However, this therapy was only successful 
when treatment was initiated before the onset of clinically mani-
fest liver damage (18).
Here, we present the potential clinical utility of copper 
chelation using methanobactin (MB) to treat acute WD. MB is a 
posttranslationally modified peptide from the methanotrophic 
proteobacterium Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, with a MW 
of 1,154 Da (metal free) and an exceptionally high copper affin-
ity (23–25). MB (Supplemental Figure 2A; supplemental material 
available online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI85226DS1)

from heterozygous Atp7b+/– control livers but steadily progressed 
in Atp7b–/– rats (Supplemental Figure 1B).
Another striking analogy between livers from patients with 
WD and Atp7b–/– rats was the structural damage of mitochondria. 
Transparent vacuoles of varying sizes containing amorphous but 
Identical tissue damage features were observed in the livers 
of untreated WD patients and diseased Atp7b–/– livers (Figure 
1A). Fibrosis was observed in all WD patients’ livers, and begin-
ning fibrosis was observed in livers from diseased Atp7b–/– rats 
(Supplemental Figure 1A). These characteristics were absent

lated mitochondria of the D-PA–pretreated WD patients (Figure 
1C). This coincided with more heterogeneous impairment of the 
mitochondrial structure (Figure 1B), which probably results from 
zonal heterogeneities originating from massive fibrosis within 
these livers (Figure 1A).
Increasing copper load impairs mitochondrial membrane integ-
rity and function. Mitochondrial copper content progressively 
increased with disease state in livers from Atp7b–/– rats (Figure 
1C and Table 1). This was paralleled by increasingly severe mem-
brane deficits, as demonstrated directly at the level of freshly 
isolated mitochondria (Figure 2) and described as follows: (a) 
a drastic decrease in structurally normal rat liver mitochondria 
(types 1 and 2) from Atp7b–/– livers compared with control livers 
and a corresponding increase in the number of structurally altered 
organelles (types 3 and 4, Figure 2A); (b) a significant alteration of 
the mitochondrial membrane “fluidity” at the polar head groups 
of the membrane lipid-water interface (TMA-DPH), but not at the 
membrane inner lipid phase (DPH) (Supplemental Table 1), as 
revealed by membrane polarization measurements with the fluo-
rophores 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and trimethylam-
monium-DPH (TMA-DPH) (33, 34); (c) a large-amplitude swell-
ing of control mitochondria upon induction of the mitochondrial 
permeability transition (MPT) (18, 35) by either calcium or copper 
that was significantly reduced in mitochondria from diseased and 
disease-onset Atp7b–/– rats (Figure 2B); (d) a significant impair-
ment of the capacity of Cys-A to block calcium-induced MPT in 
Atp7b–/– versus control mitochondria (Figure 2C and Supplemen-
tal Table 2); (e) a jeopardization of the time stability of the inner 
mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨ) and loss of ΔΨ in 
Atp7b–/– mitochondria at earlier time points compared with con-
trol mitochondria (Figure 2D and Supplemental Table 3); and (f) 
a progressive and significant impairment of the ATP production 
capacity of Atp7b–/– mitochondria  (Supplemental Figure 4F).
The bacterial peptide MB rapidly depletes accumulated mitochon-
drial copper. We compared the capability of MB with that of the 
copper chelators D-PA, TETA, and TTM to remove copper from 
freshly isolated Atp7b–/– mitochondria. While D-PA and TETA 
were without effect, TTM showed a tendency to remove copper, 
and MB significantly decreased the copper levels associated with 
Atp7b–/– mitochondria (Figure 3A). We obtained similar results 
with mitochondria from WT rats artificially preloaded with copper 
(Supplemental Figure 2, B and C). Furthermore, MB was signifi-
cantly less toxic than TTM, as shown by the impaired vital cop-
per-dependent mitochondrial respiratory complex IV (Figure 3B 
and Supplemental Figure 2D).
MB efficiently de-coppers hepatocytes with low cell toxicity. At 
the cellular level, overnight MB treatments significantly reduced 
cellular copper levels in HepG2 cells that were either copper pre-
loaded at concentrations that showed no toxicity (Figure 3C and 
Supplemental Figure 2F) or in HepG2 cells that had a normal cop-
per load (Supplemental Figure 2E). Moreover, in an attempt to test 
the efficacy of MB on samples from patients with WD, we repro-
grammed urinary epithelial cells from these patients into induced 
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that differentiated into hepatocyte-
like cells (HLCs) (Supplemental Figure 2, G–J) and found compa-
rable copper depletion levels in these HLCs following treatment 
with MB (Figure 3C).
Using a specific MB mAb, we found that MB was taken up 
dose dependently into HepG2 cells (Figure 3D) and that cyto-
toxicity occurred only at millimolar MB concentrations (Figure 
3E). At the mitochondrial level, MB concentrations of 500 μM 
reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential only partially 
(Figure 3F). Thus, MB efficiently de-coppers hepatocytes, with-
out major toxic side effects.
MB directs liver copper into bile. We further investigated the cop-
per-removing efficiency of MB at the whole-organ level (Figure 3, 
G–I, Supplemental Figure 3). During a 2-hour perfusion of Atp7b–/– 
livers, MB released 10-fold greater amounts of copper into bile 
than did TTM (Figure 3G and Supplemental Figure 3B), the major 
physiological copper excretion route (36). D-PA and TETA did not 
provoke any detectable release of copper into bile (Figure 3G). All 
chelators, except TTM, caused an increased presence of copper 
in the perfusate (Figure 3H), which may be linked to the ability of 
TTM to precipitate copper intracellularly (37). The release of cop-
per into the perfusate was partly due to hepatocellular death, as the 
cellular damage marker lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) paralleled 
the copper release curves (Supplemental Figure 3C). Of note, only 
MB treatment had already markedly reduced the Atp7b–/– liver cop-
per levels after 2 hours of perfusion (Figure 3I).
Short-term MB application reverses liver damage in vivo. We 
assessed the efficiency of short-term MB treatment in Atp7b–/– rats 
at the age of liver disease onset (85–90 days). Animals received 
either MB (i.p.) for 3 or 5 days or the clinically used copper chela-
tors D-PA or TETA (administered orally for 4 days).
MB administration strongly reduced the histopathological 
damage markers in Atp7b–/– livers (Figure 4A), in contrast to that 
observed with D-PA or TETA treatments. The latter 2 chelators 
were unable to circumvent the increase in serum AST levels (indic-
ative of progressive liver damage, Figure 4B). In contrast, in 6 of 
9 MB-treated Atp7b–/– rats, AST levels decreased (Figure 4B), and 
the animals regained BW (Table 2). Importantly, after 5 days of MB 
treatment, 2 Atp7b–/– animals with onset disease and 1 diseased 
Atp7b–/– rat were rescued from liver dysfunction (AST <200 U/l, 
Figure 4B and Table 2).
In comparison with untreated, age-matched Atp7b–/– rats and 
in contrast to D-PA or TETA treatments, MB induced a marked 
reduction in total liver copper levels, which was especially sig-
nificant in the mitochondrial compartment (Figure 4C). This 
mitochondrial de-coppering was paralleled by ultrastructural and 
biochemical restoration of Atp7b–/– mitochondria (Figure 4D and 
Supplemental Figure 4F). Severely impaired mitochondria (type 
4, Figure 2A) were almost absent in isolates from MB-treated 
Atp7b–/– rats, but not in isolates from D-PA– or TETA-treated ani-
mals (Figure 4D and Supplemental Figure 4A). Importantly, the 
impaired ATP production capacity of Atp7b–/–mitochondria was 
fully restored by MB, a result that was significantly different from 
that observed with D-PA or TETA treatments, which were without 
therapeutic effect (Supplemental Figure 4F).
Toward a new WD treatment regimen using MB. From a clinical 
perspective, we initiated experiments to scrutinize the potential 
therapeutic use of MB.
First, concerning drug safety, 4 heterozygous Atp7b+/– rats 
were treated i.p. with MB on 2 consecutive days. We observed no 
signs of toxicity, as BW, serum AST levels, and bilirubin values

a clinically relevant copper maintenance therapy in WD (9). All 
MB-treated animals showed restoration of normal serum AST lev-
els that lasted for at least 2 weeks, after which AST levels rose again 
(Figure 5A). At the time of analysis, 1 animal was still healthy, and 
2 animals manifested different stages of liver disease (Figure 5, A 
and C). The degree of liver damage correlated with mitochondrial, 
but not whole-liver, copper levels (Figure 5B), as well as with struc-
tural (Figure 5D) and functional defects in mitochondria (Supple-
mental Figure 4B).
Fourth, we conducted a first test involving replacement of 
daily chelation therapy by a regimen consisting of intense treat-
ment cycles interrupted by observation periods (Table 3). Five 
Atp7b–/– rats as well as 5 age- and sex-matched Atp7b+/– controls 
(untreated) were included, and pairs of rats were sacrificed on 
experimental days 1, 8, 29, 36, and 85, respectively. On experimen-
tal day 1, all animals were healthy, with the sacrificed Atp7b–/– rat 
showing a pronounced liver and mitochondrial copper load and 
slightly impaired mitochondrial function (87% ATP production 
capacity) compared with its Atp7b+/– control (pair 1). The 4 remain-
ing Atp7b–/– rats were subjected to the first treatment cycle consist-
ing of 3 daily i.p. MB injections for 5 days. All animals remained 
healthy, and this resulted in a 40% reduction in the copper load 
on experimental day 8 (pair 2), which increased to starting levels 
after an additional 3 weeks of observation (pair 3, day 29). Fol-
remained within the physiological range (Table 2). Furthermore, 
no changes in total liver copper levels or in the mitochondrial com-
partment were measured compared with untreated Atp7b+/– con-
trols (Figure 4E). Similarly, ATP production of mitochondria from 
MB-treated and untreated heterozygous Atp7b+/– rats was highly 
comparable (Supplemental Figure 4F). Moreover, upon i.p. injec-
tion, MB was detectable in the serum for only 45 minutes, indi-
cating a very short systemic residence time (Figure 4F). Thus, MB 
efficiently removed excessive liver copper in homozygous Atp7b–/– 
rats, but such treatments were without obvious signs of toxicity in 
Atp7b–/– rats or heterozygous Atp7b+/– control rats.
Second, with respect to alternative MB application routes, 
we found that either i.p. or i.v. injection could be used (Table 2). 
For i.v. injections, 3 Atp7b–/– rats were catheterized via the femo-
ral vein. After a 3-day recovery period, animals received daily MB 
doses on 5 consecutive days. All animals regained BW, and in rats 
with elevated AST or bilirubin, their levels returned to normal. 
Moreover, we observed a profound reduction in copper content at 
the whole-liver and purified mitochondrial levels (Table 2).
Third, we assessed the length of time that a short-term MB 
treatment postpones the onset of acute liver failure. Three Atp7b–/– 
rats were treated with MB for 5 days, and MB was discontinued 
during the subsequent observation phase. Starting with the MB 
treatment, zinc-enriched food (1,000 ppm) was given, as zinc is 
Table 2. Short-term treatments with 5× MB (once daily, i.p. or i.v.) or with 16× MB (twice daily, i.p.) reduce the mitochondrial copper load

die within a few days. In contrast, following the “acute rescue regi-
men,” animal 3 regained 29% of its BW, had a drastic reduction of 
AST and bilirubin to normal levels, and hepatic copper depletion 
associated with massive structural and functional mitochondrial 
recovery (Table 2 and Supplemental Figure 4, D–F).
Discussion
Mitochondrial copper overload occurs to a similar extent in WD 
patients and Atp7b–/– rats (Figure 1). This overload causes mito-
chondrial impairments (Figure 2) that lead to liver damage (Fig-
ures 1 and 5 and Supplemental Figures 1 and 4). Failure to respond 
to established treatments in human WD has been associated with 
a failure to deplete mitochondrial copper stores (38). Thus, rever-
sal of mitochondrial copper overload seems to be a prerequisite 
for successful treatment. Clinically used copper chelators slowly 
deplete copper stores, are ineffective in some patients with chronic 
WD, and fail to rescue many patients with acute, fulminant WD–
induced hepatitis and liver failure (1, 5, 10). Here, we show that 
MB rapidly and effectively depleted excess hepatic copper stores 
at mitochondrial, cellular, and organ levels (Figure 3 and Supple-
mental Figures 2 and 3). In vivo, MB reversed WD-associated hep-
atitis and was effective even when applied in acute, fulminant liver 
disease (Figures 4 and 5; Supplemental Figure 4; and Table 2).
lowing the second treatment cycle, copper loads decreased again, 
but were now down to 25% of the starting values, resulting in an 
unprecedented low copper load in Atp7b–/– mitochondria (pair 4, 
day 36). This 75% de-coppering efficiency was associated with a 
subsequent observation period of an additional 7 weeks, during 
which the remaining Atp7b–/– rat stayed healthy. This corresponds 
to a doubling of the age when untreated Atp7b–/– rats normally 
become diseased. On experimental day 85 (pair 5), we found that 
liver and mitochondrial copper loads were similar to those of the 
Atp7b–/– rat before the start of treatment and that mitochondrial 
function was impaired (65% of the ATP production capacity of the 
Atp7b+/– control).
MB for the treatment of acute liver failure. We assessed the 
capacity of MB to rescue diseased Atp7b–/– rats by an “acute res-
cue regimen” consisting of 2 daily MB injections for 1 week (16 
i.p. injections in total, Table 2). Four Atp7b–/– rats with strongly ele-
vated AST levels were treated. All animals survived, regained BW, 
and presented with normal serum AST and bilirubin levels and 
exceptionally low copper values at the end of the treatment reg-
imen (Table 2). This powerful therapeutic effect was best exem-
plified by the case of animal 3. Diseased Atp7b–/– rats presenting 
with progressive BW loss and bilirubin levels greater than 8 mg/
dl (Table 1) must be considered moribund, as such animals usually 
Figure 5. Short-term MB treatments postpone acute liver failure. (A) Short-term (5 days) MB-treated Atp7b–/– rats (animal age at start of treatment: 
84–85 days) remained healthy for at least 2 weeks, after which serum AST and bilirubin (not shown) levels rose again. At the time of analysis, 1 animal 
(Atp7b–/– rat 1) was still healthy, and 2 animals (Atp7b–/– rats 2 and 3) were diseased. (B–D) In the order of Atp7b–/– rats 1 to 3, respectively, mitochondrial 
copper content was elevated but not the whole-liver copper content (B), the frequency of the typical histological features of overt liver damage increased 
(C, symbols as in Figure 1 and Supplemental Figure 1), and the severity of mitochondrial structure impairments increased (D, arrows). Scale bars: 100 μm 
(C) and 500 nm (D).

or be transported out of the cell via ATP7B (4, 43). As the latter 
transporter is dysfunctional in WD, a large part of the intracellu-
lar copper accumulates in the cytosolic MT storage pool (46, 47). 
However, in the Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat model of WD, 
it was shown that the cytosol from livers just before hepatitis still 
contained Cu-unsaturated MTs and thus may still act as antiox-
idants (47). On the contrary, excess mitochondrial copper loads 
and severe mitochondrial destruction were observed at the onset 
of hepatitis in the LEC and Atp7b–/– rats (18), arguing for the piv-
otal need to reverse this mitochondrial copper overload. Given 
that mitochondrial Cco, the intermembrane Cu/Zn SOD, and the 
mitochondrial copper chaperones present with exceptionally low 
Cu1+ dissociation constants, there is a considerable driving force 
of copper into mitochondria (20, 44). Consequently, efficient 
mitochondrial copper removal may be achieved by compounds 
with high copper affinities. MB has an exceptionally high copper 
affinity (28) of more than 10–21 M, which is orders of magnitude 
higher than the affinities of known copper-binding proteins and 
ligands in eukaryotic cells (44). Thus, MB could possibly reverse 
mitochondrial copper overload.
In agreement with this, MB was able to efficiently deplete 
accumulated copper at the mitochondrial, cellular, and whole- 
organ levels to a considerable extent via excretion into bile, and no 
significant cell toxicity or mitochondrial dysfunction was induced 
(Figure 3 and Table 2). Of note, we found that a higher degree of 
liver damage (LDH release) coincided with elevated copper mobi-
lization upon liver perfusion with chelating agents (Supplemental 
Figure 3C). This finding may be of clinical relevance, as worsen-
ing of the clinical presentation is reported in up to 20% of WD 
patients with neurological symptoms, despite sufficiently dosed 
chelation treatment with D-PA or TETA (5, 48, 49). Such deteri-
oration may be explained by chelator-induced liver copper mobi-
lization possibly leading to secondary copper toxicity to the brain 
(48, 50, 51). Thus, in severe WD states, liver copper mobilization 
The increasing copper burden directly affected the structural, 
physical, and biochemical integrity of mitochondrial membranes 
(Figure 2). Atp7b–/– liver mitochondria showed considerable matrix 
condensations, intermembrane space deposits, and cristae dilata-
tions (Figure 2A). Using fluorescence polarization, we observed a 
steady increase in TMA-DPH polarization values in Atp7b–/– mito-
chondrial membranes and an increasing copper load (Supple-
mental Table 1). Thus, excessive mitochondrial copper deposition 
physically alters the mitochondrial membrane lipid-water inter-
face (33, 34, 39), plausibly by direct interaction with mitochon-
drial membrane proteins (18). This results in a significantly lower 
extent of expansion upon induction of the MPT (ref. 40 and Figure 
2B). Furthermore, the capacity of Cys-A to block calcium-induced 
MPT was significantly impaired in Atp7b–/– liver mitochondria 
(Figure 2C and Supplemental Table 2). Cys-A normally inhibits 
MPT by blocking inner mitochondrial membrane binding of its 
target protein Cyp-D (40, 41). Biochemically, Atp7b–/– mitochon-
dria lost their ability to sustain their inner transmembrane poten-
tial (ΔΨ) with a progressively greater copper load (Figure 2D and 
Supplemental Table 3), as well as their capacity to produce ATP 
(Supplemental Figure 4F). Since impaired mitochondrial mem-
branes can seal the point of no return toward death (42), we con-
clude that efficient therapeutic measures against WD must rely on 
the reduction of mitochondrial copper concentrations.
Hepatic copper transport and homeostasis require various 
membrane transporters, a subset of intracellular copper chaper-
ones (43), and low-molecular-weight binding partners like gluta-
thione (44), but also as-yet uncharacterized intracellular ligands 
(4, 45). Copper enters the cell via high-affinity transporters like 
copper transporter 1, and it is believed that differential copper 
affinities of the binding partners direct the metal to its final cel-
lular destination (44). Copper can enter the Cu-metallothionein 
(MT) storage pool, be routed to copper-dependent enzymes (e.g., 
Cu/Zn SOD or the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase [Cco]),

An unprecedented low Atp7b–/– mitochondrial copper load was found after the second treatment cycle and was associated with a disease-free state until 
experimental day 85, which corresponded to a doubling of the age when untreated Atp7b–/– rats become diseased. Five Atp7b–/– rats and five age- and 
sex-matched Atp7b+/– controls (untreated) were compared pairwise on experimental days 1, 8, 29, 36, and 85, respectively. A pronounced copper load 
was found in Atp7b–/– rat 1 on experimental day 1, and the remaining 4 Atp7b–/– rats were treated with MB (3×/day i.p., 5 days). This resulted in a 40% 
reduction in copper load in Atp7b–/– rat 2 by experimental day 8, a level that increased after 3 weeks of observation in Atp7b–/– rat 3. An unprecedentedly 
low mitochondrial copper load was found in Atp7b–/– rat 4 after the second treatment cycle (days 29–33, 3×/day i.p.) and was associated with a disease-free 
state until experimental day 85 in Atp7b–/– rat 5, corresponding to a doubling of the age when untreated LPP–/– rats become diseased.

3C and Supplemental Figure 2E). Hence, zinc-stabilized MB may 
be advantageous for applications requiring prolonged persistence 
at elevated temperatures.
With regard to drug safety, we observed no signs of MB tox-
icity in Atp7b–/– rats treated up to 3 times per day (Table 3) or in 
heterozygous Atp7b+/– control rats treated for 2 consecutive days 
(Figure 4E). However, one potential issue could be an immune 
response against the MB peptide. While it cannot be completely 
excluded, this appears unlikely, because small compounds like 
MB, with a MW of approximately 1,000, are considered nonim-
munogenic (57). Moreover, no toxicity was observed in animals 
that underwent repetitive cycles of intense MB treatments (Table 
3), and the first ELISA analyses testing sera of these treated ani-
mals for “anti-MB” Abs were negative. Nevertheless, this issue 
will need further attention.
In conclusion, we report what we believe to be an innovative 
therapeutic strategy for treating WD that consists of a short but 
intense de-coppering treatment with MB that proved effective, 
even at the acute liver failure stage in a WD rat model. In total, 
24 Atp7b–/– rats at various stages of disease were highly effectively 
treated once, twice, or thrice daily, either by i.p. or i.v. injection of 
MB (Tables 2 and 3, and Figure 5). All treated animals were res-
cued, and liver damage reappeared only after several weeks of 
drug-free phases. The treatment of patients with bacterial sidero-
phores is not without precedent, as exemplified by deferoxamine 
from Streptomyces pilosus, which is used for treating iron poisoning 
and hemochromatosis (58). We therefore propose MB as an addi-
tional candidate in this pharmaceutical class and as the lead drug 
of choice to develop a more efficient and safe treatment of WD.
Methods
Patient-derived samples
Livers from 4 WD patients with liver failure who had undergone liver 
transplantation at the University Hospital Heidelberg were included 
in this study. Two patients (patients 1 and 2) had received no prior 
copper chelation therapy, while 2 patients (patients 3 and 4) presented 
with liver failure after D-PA treatment. Upon explantation, the WD 
patients’ livers were shock-frozen in LN2 and stored at –80°C. Thawed 
samples were immediately fixed using formalin (Bio Optica Milano) 
for histological analysis or glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sci-
ences) for electron microscopic analysis.
WD patients’ urinary epithelial cells were collected from freshly 
donated mid-stream urine.
Animals
The LPP rat strain was provided by Jimo Borjigin (University of Mich-
igan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) (16), and Lou/c rats were originally 
from Harlan Winkelmann. Rats were maintained on an ad libitum 
Altromin 1314 diet (Altromin Spezialfutter) and tap water. The basic 
copper content of this standard diet was 13 mg/kg. Heterozygous 
Atp7b+/– rats served as controls in this study.
Animal treatments
In vivo treatments. LPP rats were treated with MB by daily i.p. injections 
for 3 or 5 consecutive days or by twice-daily i.p. injections for 8 consec-
utive days at a dose of 150 mg/kg BW, or for 4 days via D-PA–contain-
into the bloodstream may be adverse — if the low-affinity chela-
tor used succeeds in extracting copper from hepatic stores — yet 
releases the bound metal before its excretion. Therefore, treating 
WD with high-affinity chelators such as MB, which has a copper 
affinity several orders of magnitude greater than that of D-PA (52), 
may constitute a pivotal advantage. In agreement with this notion, 
in preliminary studies, we observed that administering MB for 2 to 
8 days (i.p.) did not elevate total brain copper levels. In addition, 
several studies (e.g., refs. 53, 54) reported improvement of neu-
rological symptoms upon liver transplantation, strengthening the 
view that some of the excess brain copper may be excreted upon 
restoration of a physiological copper excretion into bile. MB causes 
a highly efficient excretion of copper into bile (Figure 3G). Taken 
together, these results support the prediction of an improvement 
of neurological symptoms upon MB therapy; however, this needs 
to be substantiated in future studies.
The superior in vitro and ex vivo de-coppering efficiency of 
MB led us to investigate a new treatment strategy in Atp7b–/– rats. 
Instead of the typical WD treatment regimen involving long-
term oral administration of copper chelators, we used a short but 
intense de-coppering treatment with repetitive injections of MB 
(Figures 4 and 5, and Table 2). In contrast to D-PA and TETA, 
short-term i.p. MB administration significantly de-coppered 
Atp7b–/– liver mitochondria, which was paralleled by a regression 
of mitochondrial structural deficits and liver damage (Figure 
4). In addition, following a 5-day MB regimen and subsequent 
treatment discontinuation, all animals remained healthy for at 
least 2 weeks (Figure 5). This delayed disease reappearance can-
not be attributed to the zinc-enriched diet given from the start 
of MB treatment, since hepatic copper reaccumulation occurred 
despite zinc supplementation. In fact, in a further experiment 
with repeated MB treatment cycles and drug-free intervals with-
out zinc supplementation (Table 3), the disease onset was delayed 
to beyond 166 days of age, an approximate doubling of the dis-
ease-free period in the Atp7b–/– rat. Importantly, the disease status 
clearly correlated with mitochondrial, but not whole-liver, copper 
content (Figure 5B). Therefore, the parameters for mitochondrial 
copper content, structure, and biochemical functionality not only 
serve as early response markers for disease progression in WD 
patients and Atp7b–/– rats (Figures 1 and 2 and Supplemental Fig-
ure 4F), but also as diagnostic biomarkers of treatment efficiency 
(Figure 4, C and D) and predictive markers of recurrence of liver 
damage (Figure 5, B and D, and Table 3). We observed that both 
i.p. and i.v. MB administration efficiently depleted mitochondrial 
copper levels (Table 2). At present, the acid sensitivity of MB (55) 
precludes its oral administration (in contrast to current clinical 
pharmacotherapy), a limitation that may, however, be overcome 
by using biocompatible polymers or other galenic formulations 
(56). Nevertheless, parenteral MB administration has fast and reli-
able effects, and injecting MB twice daily proved to be particularly 
efficient, reversing the disease phenotype even in animals that 
had signs of advanced liver dysfunction (Table 2 and Supplemen-
tal Figure 4, D–F). Further, concerning the temperature stability of 
MB, we observed a time-dependent destabilization of MB at 37°C 
(Supplemental Figure 4C), which was effectively avoided, how-
ever, upon prestabilization by zinc (Supplemental Figure 4C) and 
did not interfere with the de-coppering properties of MB (Figure

measured by light scattering at 540 nm, and Δψm was followed by 
Rh123 fluorescence quenching in a 96-well plate reader (BioTek, Syn-
ergy 2; Bad Friedrichshall) (64). For calculation, in cases with onset but 
not-yet finished MMP depletion, end values were set to 180 minutes. 
Polarization was measured in DPH and TMA-DPH–dyed mitochondria 
(33, 34). In brief, mitochondria (3 mg/ml) were incubated for 30 min-
utes at 37°C with either DPH or TMA-DPH (50 μM and 20 μM, respec-
tively). Parallel and perpendicular fluorescence was assessed in dupli-
cate at ex 366 nm and em 425 nm. Polarization was calculated (65) in 
mPol using the following formula: P = (I║ – G × I┴)/(I║ + G × I┴); G = 0.89.
In vitro treatment of isolated mitochondria with chelators. Freshly 
isolated Atp7b–/– mitochondria with elevated copper levels were sub-
jected to 30-minute chelator treatments with either 2 mM D-PA, 
TETA, TTM, or MB and subsequently repurified by a Nycodenz-gra-
dient to separate liberated copper from mitochondria. For validation, 
mitochondria from Atp7b+/– control rats were incubated with 1 mM 
DTT (Roche) for 5 minutes at room temperature, and thereafter, Cu2+ 
(Copper (II) Chloride Dihydrate; Sigma-Aldrich) was added at final 
concentrations of 200–600 μM for 20 minutes. Copper-loaded mito-
chondria were then repurified by Nycodenz-gradient centrifugation 
and subsequently treated with chelators as described above.
Cell culture
All cell lines were from ATCC unless otherwise indicated.
HepG2 cells were kept in MEM (Life Technologies) with 2% FCS 
(Biochrom). We found that Zn-MB was time stable at 37°C, in contrast 
to metal-free MB (Supplemental Figure 4C). Therefore, Zn-MB, gen-
erated by preparing a 20-mM MB solution and adding an equimolar 
concentration of Zn2+ (Zinc acetate; Sigma-Aldrich) solution under pH 
control, was used in cell culture experiments.
A neutral red cell toxicity assay (Sigma-Aldrich) was performed as 
described elsewhere (66). HepG2 cells (2 × 104) were incubated for 24 
hours with medium alone (negative control), 0.05 to 1 mM zinc-MB 
or TTM, 0.002–1 mM copper-histidine, or 0.25 mM carbonyl cyanide 
m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) as a mitochondriotoxic positive 
control and were subsequently analyzed.
For immunofluorescence staining, 2 × 104 HepG2 cells were 
incubated with medium alone, 500 μM MB, or 250 μM CCCP in 
black 96-well plates with a clear glass bottom (PerkinElmer). Stain-
ing was done using 1.6 μM Hoechst 33342 (excitation wavelength 
[ex] 360–400 nm; emission wavelength [em] 410–480 nm); 300 nM 
MitoTracker Deep Red (ex 620–640 nm, em 650–760 nm); and 1 μM 
nonyl acridine orange (NAO) (ex 460–490 nm, em 500–550 nm) for 
40 minutes at 37°C. After a washing step, fluorescence was analyzed 
using an Operetta System (PerkinElmer).
Cellular de-coppering by MB was assessed in HepG2 cells pre-
treated for 24 hours with either medium or 15 μM copper-histidine 
and after a subsequent 24-hour treatment with 500 μM MB. After 2 
washing steps, copper levels in 2.5 × 106 HepG2 cells were determined 
by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-
OES). Cellular MB uptake was determined from HepG2 cell lysates 
incubated for 2 or 24 hours with MB at different concentrations by a 
competitive ELISA using an anti-MB mAb.
MB Ab generation and competitive ELISA
Lou/c rats were immunized with a mixture of OVA-coupled MB (50 μg) 
(Squarix), 5 nmol CPG oligonucleotide (TIB MOLBIOL; Syntheselabor), 
ing drinking water at a dose of 100 mg/kg BW/day or TETA-containing 
drinking water at 480 mg/kg BW/day (assuming 40 ml water intake per 
day for a rat weighing 250 g), respectively (59, 60). Based on a mean cop-
per content of 250 μg/g wet weight (ww) in Atp7b–/– rat livers at the start 
of treatment (18), Atp7b–/– rat livers of 8 g ww contain approximately 31.5 
μmol copper. Single MB doses were chosen in amounts equimolar to this 
copper amount. As for D-PA, the dose and route of administration used 
in this study were previously reported to successfully prevent the onset 
of hepatitis in LEC rats in long-term regimens (59). Subchronic toxicity 
studies in rats have revealed no toxicity of TETA at a dose of 3,000 ppm 
via the drinking water (60). With respect to the mean liver copper con-
tent in 85-day-old Atp7b–/– rats, the molar ratios of the chelators applied 
was MB 1:D-PA 4.3:TETA 17.4, respectively. For i.v. MB application 
(150 mg/kg BW), catheters connected to a PinPort (Instech Laborato-
ries) were inserted into the rat’s femoral vein, fixed with nonabsorbable 
sutures, and s.c. tunneled and exteriorized through a skin incision made 
between the shoulders.
Liver perfusion
Atp7b–/– livers (from animals aged 79–83 days) were perfused via the 
portal vein in a single-pass manner with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate 
solution containing 5 mM glucose, gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, 
and kept at 37°C (61, 62). The right lateral liver lobe was ligated, and 
its copper content served as a preperfusion control. After bile duct 
cannulation, a 20-minute bile sample was collected before the cop-
per chelators were continuously added to the perfusion medium. Bile 
and outflow perfusates (from which LDH was measured) were col-
lected at 10-minute intervals (61, 62). D-PA/HCl (20 mg/108 μmol); 
TETA/2HCl (20 mg/91 μmol); TTM/2 NH4 (10 mg/38 μmol); and MB 
(40 mg/35 μmol) were each dissolved in 50 ml 0.9% NaCl and contin-
uously added to the perfusion medium via a perfusion pump (Perfu-
sor; B. Braun Melsungen) for 2 hours. The molar ratios of the chelators 
used was MB 1:D-PA 3.1:TETA 2.6:TTM 1.1. Control perfusions were 
done with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution only.
Histological examination, plasma/serum AST, and bilirubin
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver samples were cut into 
4-μm-thick sections and stained with either H&E (Carl Roth GmbH 
+ Co. KG) or Masson’s trichrome (Merck KG) for analysis of fibrotic 
tissue. AST activity and bilirubin concentration in animal plasma or 
serum were measured with a Reflotron system (Roche Diagnostics).
Mitochondrial analyses
Mitochondria were derived from either frozen, explanted WD 
patients’ livers or freshly prepared rat liver homogenates, as described 
previously (35, 63), and purified by differential and density gradient 
centrifugation using either Percoll (GE Healthcare Europe) or Nyco-
denz (Axis-Shield). Fresh rat liver mitochondria were used for respira-
tory measurements, chelator treatments, analyses of swelling (MPT), 
transmembrane potential (Δψm), polarization experiments, and ATP 
synthesis and were fixed with glutaraldehyde for subsequent electron 
microscopic analyses. Stored frozen mitochondria were used for respi-
ratory complex IV activity and metal analyses.
Mitochondrial functional integrity was assessed by standard respi-
ratory measurements in a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Oxygraph; 
Hansatech Instruments) (18). ATP synthesis was analyzed by the ATP 
Bioluminescence Assay Kit (Roche) (18). Mitochondrial swelling was

and changed to OptiMEM (Gibco) containing MB (300 μM). After a 
24-hour incubation, washed cells were collected and counted and 
their copper content assessed.
Metal content determination
Copper levels in liver homogenates, cell lysates, and mitochondrial 
preparations were analyzed by ICP-OES (Ciros Vision; SPECTRO 
Analytical Instruments) after wet-ashing of samples with 65% nitric 
acid (Merck KGaA) (18).
Electron microscopic analysis
Electron microscopic analysis of liver tissues and mitochondria was 
done as previously described (35).
Mitochondria structural analyses
For structural analyses, isolated mitochondria were categorized as 
type 1 (normal structured mitochondria of the “condensed” type; 
ref. 71); type 2 (mitochondria with minor alterations such as slightly 
increased cristae); type 3 (mitochondria with massively increased 
cristae); and type 4 (mitochondria with massive matrix condensations, 
matrix vacuolization, detachments of the inner boundary membrane, 
and severe cristae deformations).
Miscellaneous
MB was isolated from the spent media of Methylosinus trichosporium 
OB3b as previously described (72). Endotoxin in MB was detected by 
a kinetic chromogenic method (Charles River Laboratories) and was 
on average 4.5 IU/mg. Copper-histidine solutions (1:3) were prepared 
as described previously (73). Protein quantification was done by the 
Bradford assay. Cytochrome C oxidase activity in isolated mitochon-
dria was determined as described elsewhere (74).
Chemicals
D-PA was a gift of Heyl Pharma; TETA was from Sigma-Aldrich; and 
TTM (98% pure) was a gift of KT. Suzuki (Chiba University, Chiba 
Japan). CCCP was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich; DPH, TMA-DPH, 
MitoTracker Deep red, and NAO were obtained from Molecular 
Probes; and Hoechst 33342 was obtained from Life Technologies.
Statistics
Throughout this study “N” equals the number of analyzed animals 
and “n” the number of measurements. Data are presented as the mean 
± SD. A Grubbs outlier test (ESD method, extreme studentized devi-
ate) was performed if more than 4 technical replicates were available. 
A significance level of α = 0.05 was used. In detail, data from Figure 
1C, Figure 2, A and B, Supplemental Figure 4F, and Supplemental 
Tables 1–3 were corrected for outliers. Statistical significance was 
analyzed using 1-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test 
when comparing 3 or more sample sets (GraphPad Prism 7; GraphPad 
Software). For comparison between 2 groups the unpaired 2-tailed 
Student’s t test with Welch’s correction was used (GraphPad Prism 7). 
A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Study approval
All patients provided informed consent, and the study was approved 
by the ethics committee of the Medical University of Heidelberg, Ger-
many (for the study of liver samples from patients with WD) and by the 
500 μl PBS, and 500 μl incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich). 
A boost without adjuvant was given 6 weeks after the primary injection. 
Fusion was performed using rat spleen and P3X63Ag8.653 myeloma 
(ATCC) cells (67). mAbs from these tissue culture supernatants (TCSs) 
were tested in an ELISA-plate solid-phase immunoassay (Corning Life 
Sciences) against BSA-coupled MB or an irrelevant BSA-coupled pep-
tide at a concentration of 4 μg/ml. For detection, HRP-conjugated mAbs 
with IgG-specific isotypes were purified from myeloma supernatants 
(TIB173: IgG2a; TIB174: IgG2b; and TIB170: IgG1, all from ATCC; R-2c: 
IgG2c, from Helmholtz Center Munich) using the Protein A Sepharose 4 
FastFlow (GE Healthcare Europe), and HRP conjugated using the LYNX 
Rapid HRP Antibody Conjugation Kit (Bio-Rad AbD Serotec). HRP was 
visualized with the 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
Eighty-six hybridomas that reacted specifically with MB were frozen, 
and Ab-containing TCSs were used for further analysis.
Competitive ELISA. Fifty microliters of each TCS (diluted 1:10 
with buffer consisting of PBS, 5% FCS, and 0.01% sodium azide) was 
preincubated with 50 μl MB solution (1,000 ng/ml in buffer) or with 
buffer overnight (in duplicate). For screening, 50 μl of these samples 
was added for 10 minutes to MB-coated ELISA plates. After washing, 
bound Abs against MB were detected with HRP-conjugated mAbs as 
described above. mAbs that recognized free MB (no signal when pre-
incubated with MB, positive signal in the buffer control) were further 
analyzed in serial MB dilutions (1,000 ng/ml to 2 ng/ml). The 4 mAbs 
that best recognized free MB were established (10B10, 12D9, 18H7, 
and 21G5, all of the rat IgG2a subclass). In subsequent titration exper-
iments on MB-coated ELISA plates, the titer of 10B10 was found to 
be of highest reactivity and was therefore subsequently used (1:500 
dilution, 1-hour preincubation).
Generation of HLCs from WD patients
WD patients’ urinary epithelial cells were pelleted at 400 ×g for 10 
minutes from freshly donated mid-stream urine (68). Cells were cul-
tured in culture medium (DMEM/F12; Lonza Group) supplemented 
with 10% FBS (PAA Laboratories); 0.1 mM nonessential aa (NEAA) 
(Sigma-Aldrich); 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco); 1 mM Gluta-
MAX (Life Technologies); and SingleQuot Kit CC-4127 REGM (Lonza 
Group) and reprogrammed into iPSCs by nucleofection of episomal 
expression vectors pCXLE-hOCT3/4-shp53-F, pCXLE-hSK, and pCX-
LE-hUL (Addgene) using the Amaxa Basic Nucleofector Kit (Lonza 
Group AG; VPI-1005). iPSCs were maintained on Matrigel-coated 
plates (Corning) in mTeSR cell culture medium and dissociated with 1 
U/ml dispase (STEMCELL Technologies) into small clusters and sub-
cultured every 5 to 7 days. WD iPSCs were differentiated into HLCs 
by a modification of the method reported previously (69, 70). iPSCs (5 
× 104) in Matrigel-precoated 6-well plates were incubated in DMEM/
F12 enriched with 100 ng/ml recombinant Activin-A (PeproTech); 
100 ng/ml FGF2 (PeproTech); and 50 ng/ml recombinant human 
WNT3A (R&D Systems). Subsequently, medium was changed up 
to day 14 according to standard protocols (69, 70). Cells were char-
acterized by flow cytometry to assess albumin expression using the 
anti-human serum albumin Ab (Abcam; catalog ab2406) and the goat 
anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary Ab with Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog A-11012) for detection and by quan-
titative real-time PCR to assess typical markers of hepatocyte lineage.
HLCs were incubated on day 14 with copper-histidine (15 μM) for 
24 hours in a 6-well plate. The following day, medium was removed
