Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the immune checkpoint anti–programmed cell death protein 1 (aPD-1) have
demonstrated impressive benefits for the treatment of some cancers; however, these drugs are not always effective,
andwestillhavealimitedunderstandingofthemechanismsthatcontributetotheirefficacyorlackthereof.Weusedinvivo
imaging to uncover the fate and activity of aPD-1 mAbs in real time and at subcellular resolution in mice. We show that
aPD-1 mAbs effectively bind PD-1+ tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells at early time points after administration. However, this
engagement is transient, and aPD-1mAbs are captured withinminutes from the T cell surface by PD-1− tumor-associated
macrophages. We further show that macrophage accrual of aPD-1 mAbs depends both on the drug’s Fc domain glycan
and on Fcg receptors (FcgRs) expressed by host myeloid cells and extend these findings to the human setting. Finally, we
demonstrate that in vivo blockade of FcgRs before aPD-1 mAb administration substantially prolongs aPD-1 mAb binding
to tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and enhances immunotherapy-induced tumor regression in mice. These investigations
yield insight into aPD-1 target engagement in vivo and identify specific Fc/FcgR interactions that can be modulated to
improve checkpoint blockade therapy.
INTRODUCTION
Immune checkpoint blockade isarecent developmentin cancer therapy
that has shown remarkable results in certain cancers and patient groups
(1–3). Currently approved immune checkpoint blockers are monoclonal
antibodies(mAbs)thattargettheprogrammedcelldeathprotein1(PD-1)
or cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4 pathways, and agents
targeting other pathways are in clinical development (including OX40,
Tim-3, and LAG-3) (4). Checkpoint inhibitors are used to reactivate
exhausted tumor-specific T cells and reinstate cancer immunosurveillance
(5, 6). Some cancer tissues limit antitumor immunity by up-regulating
immunosuppressive factors such as PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) that binds to
PD-1 on tumor-specific CD8+ T cells (7). Drugs targeting the PD-1/PD-L1
immune checkpoint axis can block immunosuppressive signals and en-
able T cell–mediated elimination of cancer cells (8). However, immune
checkpoint blockade is not alwayseffective, andwe lacka complete under-
standing of the mechanisms that contribute to efficacy and resistance (9).
At present, experimental and clinical evidence suggests that a pre-
existing tumor infiltrate of CD8+ T cells is one of the most favorable
prognostic indicators of checkpoint inhibitor response (10). Also, pa-
tients with the highest degree of neoantigen burden (high mutational
load) in their cancers may have increased tumor infiltration by T cells
and more robust responses to checkpoint blockade (11, 12). Histology
and sequencing methodologies have been used to define metrics of cy-
totoxic T cell infiltration in tumors (13), with a focus on the identifica-
tion of tumor neoantigens and the resultant antigen-specific T cell
expansion after immunotherapy (11). These studies have provided
insight into the mechanism of anti–PD-1 (aPD-1) mAb–induced anti-
tumor T cell activation and spurred efforts focused on identifying new
strategies that foster T cell recruitment to tumors (14–16).
Much less is known about checkpoint inhibitors’ in vivo pharmaco-
kinetics and interactions with host components in the tumor bed. Studying
these parameters is likely essential to identifying resistance mechanisms
and developing improved therapeutic options. Here, we used intravital
imaging to follow fluorescently labeled aPD-1 mAbs in real time and at
subcellular resolution. Because tumor microenvironments are home to
diverse host cell types, and immune checkpoint blockers are unlikely to
solely act on T cells, we focused on aPD-1 mAb interactions with various
host components by simultaneously assessing aPD-1 mAbs, tumor cells,
CD8 T cells, and myeloid cells/macrophages. We investigated tumor-
infiltrating CD8+ T cellsbecause they expressPD-1 and are the expected
targets of aPD-1 mAbs. We also investigated myeloid cells because they
are frequently found in the stroma of growing tumors (17), and emerging
evidence indicates that they can affect virtually all therapeutic modalities,
including immunotherapy (18). Our results not only confirm existing
knowledge on PD-1 inhibition but also uncover findings with therapeutic
implications to further improve immunotherapy.
RESULTS
Global aPD-1 mAb biodistribution
We initially sought to track the temporal distribution of aPD-1 mAbs
in vivo at the organ level. We thus covalently labeled aPD-1 mAb
(clone 29F.1A12) with an Alexa Fluor 647 dye (AF647–aPD-1) using
N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) chemistry. For maximal brightness
without dye quenching, we optimized the labeling conditions to achieve
about four fluorochrome molecules per antibody. For in vitro studies,
the EL4 mouse lymphoma cell line was used as a T cell model because of
its stable PD-1 expression and its broad adaptation to in vitro culture

 (19). Using this cell line, we confirmed that fluorescent labeling of
aPD-1 did not interfere with the drug’s binding specificity (Fig. 1A).
In addition, AF647–aPD-1 retained therapeutic activity in the ovalbumin-
expressing MC38 tumor model, which is responsive to single-agent
aPD-1 therapy (Fig. 1B) (20). Collectively, these data indicate that
AF647–aPD-1 retains PD-1 tropism and antitumor activities.
We next examined the in vivo biodistribution of AF647–aPD-1 in
the wild-type MC38 tumor model, which also responds to aPD-1 treat-
ment, but lessefficiently than the ovalbumin-expressing MC38counter-
part in which aPD-1treatment resultsin uniformtumorrejection. Mouse
cohorts were sacrificed at times ranging from 0.5 to 72 hours after treat-
ment, and organs were removed for fluorescence measurements (Fig. 1C).
AF647–aPD-1 signal was primarily retained within tumors over time (Fig.
1D and fig. S1). We observed a large spike of AF647–aPD-1 in the liver,
lungs, kidney, and spleen at 0.5 hours after injection, followed by a sub-
sequent decrease over time that coincided with increases in AF647–
aPD-1 signal in the tumor (Fig. 1D). Collectively, these data indicate
that the drug started to accumulate in tumors within minutes after
injection but that maximal aPD-1 accumulation in the tumor was
achieved after 24 hours.
Cellular kinetics and dynamics of aPD-1
After observing that aPD-1 mAbs collect within the tumor micro-
environment shortly after administration, we further aimed to study
whether the drugs bind their intended target T cells at the tumor site.
To this end, we used intravital microscopy in dorsal skinfold chambers,
which enabled us to examine the distribution and tropism of AF647–
aPD-1atsubcellularresolutionwithinthetumorstromaandlongitudinally
after drug administration (Fig. 2A). The experimental system allowed
simultaneous tracking of four components: aPD-1 mAbs (labeled with
AF647), MC38 tumor cells (labeled with H2B-mApple), T cells [labeled
with green fluorescent protein (GFP) or yellow fluorescent protein
(YFP)], and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) (labeled with Pacific
Blue–dextran nanoparticles). We used two different reporter mouse
models to visualize T cells: (i) DPE-GFP mice (21) in which all GFP-
expressingcellsareCD90+(fig.S2A)and(ii)interferon-g (IFN-g)reporter
(GREAT) mice (22), which were useful because tumor-infiltrating YFP+
cells in these mice were almost exclusively CD8+ T cells (fig. S2B). The
fluorescent Pacific Blue–dextran nanoparticle has been validated for in-
tratumoralmacrophageidentification(23),andweconfirmeditsspecificity
for macrophages (F4/80+ cells) in the tumor stroma (fig. S2C). Finally,
we verified that single-agent aPD-1 treatment was able to suppress MC38–
H2B-mApple tumor growth in the window chamber system (Fig. 2B).
Upon administration of AF647–aPD-1, we found that the antibody
rapidly perfused tumor vessels and gradually disseminated out of the
vasculature and into the tumor interstitium (Fig. 2C and movie S1).
AF647–aPD-1wasobservedon GFP-labeledTcellsasearly as5minafter
injection, and these were the first cells in the tumor microenvironment to
be detectably labeled by the drug. AF647–aPD-1 binding to tumor-
infiltrating T cells was initially pericellular but, within minutes, formed
puncta on the cell surface (fig. S3). These rearrangements occurred
without apparent decreased T cell motility (fig. S4, A to C). Later time
points revealed that TAMs, which were stationary in the tumor micro-
environment (fig. S4D), had collected most of the AF647–aPD-1; T cells
were not associated with AF647–aPD-1 at these time points (Fig. 2, D
and E). T cells were present in the tumor microenvironment at all times
examined, removing the possibility that the drug biodistribution was an
artifact of T cell loss after therapy. Also, tracing AF647–aPD-1 across all
time points failed to show binding to tumor cells, precluding the possi-
bility that aPD-1 mAbs had direct effects on cancer cells (fig. S5).
Quantification of the tumor microenvironment images taken at
15 min or 24 hours after drug administration showed a pattern of

 AF647 signal loss on T cells over time and a concomitant AF647 signal
increase on macrophages (Fig. 3A). Although DPE-GFP labels CD90+
lymphocytes (fig. S2A), the GREAT mouse model allowed us to focus
specifically on IFN-g–expressing cells (movie S2), which are almost
exclusively CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment (fig. S2B).
Intravital imaging of these cells confirmed surface binding of AF647–
aPD-1 within minutes after drug administration (fig. S3). Longitudinal
studies further showed that T cells eventually lose AF647–aPD-1 mAbs,
which are physically transferred to, and retained by, neighboring macro-
phages (Fig. 3B). Consistent with our observations in DPE-GFP mice, we
found in IFN-g reporter mice that aPD-1 transfer from T cells to macro-
phages limited the overall duration of drug binding to their intended
target cells (Fig. 3C).
To address whether checkpoint blockade agent uptake by macro-
phagescouldbe independently validated using abulktissue measurement,
we performed flow cytometry of tissues excised from tumor-bearing
animals at 0.5 and 24 hours after AF647–aPD-1 administration (Fig. 3D).
We evaluated several relevant cell populations for aPD-1 binding and
confirmed our intravital microscopy observations: aPD-1 mAbs were
bound mostly to CD8+ Tcellsat 0.5 hoursbut to macrophages at 24 hours
(Fig.3,DandE).TumormacrophageswerepositiveforratIgG2a(fig.S6),

Analysis of B16 melanoma and KP1.9 lung adenocarcinoma tumor
models also demonstrated that most AF647–aPD-1 mAbs accumulate
within TAMs at 24 hours, similar to the findings obtained with MC38
colon adenocarcinoma (fig. S7A). Most of the intratumoral macrophages
were bound by AF647–aPD-1 in all three tumor models (fig. S7B). Linear
regression analysis of combined data further indicated that aPD-1 mAb

 uptake by macrophages is independent of macrophage number and can
also occur when TAM numbers are relatively low (fig. S7C).
aPD-1 mAb transfer mechanism
To explore the removal of aPD-1 mAbs on T cells by macrophages, we
first asked whether the latter may also express PD-1 on their surface.
However, ex vivo flow cytometry analysis indicated that TAMs, in con-
trast to tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, were PD-1− (Fig. 4A). PD-1 was
also absent in natural killer and B cells in these tumors (fig. S8). We then
designed an in vitro coculture system combining bone marrow–derived
macrophages and T cells that constitutively express PD-1 to create a
controlled system to study the mechanism of drug collection by macro-
phages (Fig. 4B). T cells were preincubated with AF647–aPD-1 to emulate
the antibody initially bound to T cells we observed in vivo and then co-
cultured with macrophages. Using this experimental setting, AF647–
aPD-1 mAbs effectively relocated from T cells to macrophages within
several minutes, as detected by the formation of drug puncta within
macrophages (Fig. 4, B and C, and movie S3). The transfer could not be
attributed solely to phagocytosis of cell debris because it occurred even in
the presence of the phagocytosis inhibitor dynasore (Fig. 4B). No macro-
phage uptake was observed when using an AF647-labeled isotype control
IgG antibody, which did not bind T cells (fig. S9).
Because tumor macrophages did not capture AF647–aPD-1 in sub-
stantial quantities early after administration, did not express PD-1 on
their cell surface, and withdrew drug bound to the T cell surface, we
reasoned that AF647–aPD-1 mAbs must accumulate in macrophages
through a non–antigen-specific mechanism. The aPD-1 clone 29F.1A12
is a rat IgG2a isotype that is used to mimic the biological properties of
human IgG4. Both rat IgG2a and human IgG4 have been demonstrated
to bind inhibitory FcgRs (mouse FcgRIIb and human FcgRIIB, respec-
tively) (24, 25). Adding FcgRIIb/III blocking antibodies to the in vitro
coculture system diminished AF647–aPD-1 transfer from T cells to
macrophages (Fig. 4, B and C). The effect was specific because blocking
FcgRIV, an Fc receptor that does not bind rat IgG2a, failed to inhibit
AF647–aPD-1 transfer (Fig. 4, B and C).
To substantiate these findings, we developed a flow cytometry–
based antibody transfer assay: Macrophages were incubated with T cells
previously labeled with AF647–aPD-1 mAbs for 30 min and analyzed
by flow cytometry. AF647–aPD-1 signal was detected on macrophages
in this experimental setting (Fig. 4D); however, aPD-1 transfer could be

 neutralized by adding a blocking antibody to FcgRIIb/III to the co-
culture system (Fig. 4, D and E). AF647–aPD-1 mAbs added directly to
the culture medium in the absence of T cells were not efficiently taken up
by macrophages, further suggesting that
T cells are the major source of aPD-1 for
macrophages (Fig. 4, D and E). We also
tested whether aPD-1 loss on the T cell
surface might be due to receptor internal-
izationindependentofmacrophageuptake.
T cells were exposed to AF647–aPD-1 for
1 hour at 37°C, treated with an acid solu-
tion to remove cell surface antibodies, and
analyzed by flow cytometry to assess re-
maining (internalized) fluorescent signals
(fig. S10A) (26). Acid stripping strongly
reduced AF647–aPD-1 detection, indicat-
ing that antibody internalization is likely
not the primary contributor to aPD-1 loss
on T cells (fig. S10B).
Macrophages cocultured with AF647–
aPD-1–coated T cells were positive not
only for AF647 but also for rat IgG2a, as
assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (fig. S11A). The eventual decline in
macrophage rat IgG2a was not accompa-
nied by the release of IgG2a into the super-
natant, suggesting that acquired antibody
is eventually degraded by the macrophage
(fig. S11B). Collectively, these data indicate
that aPD-1 mAb removal from the T cell
surface receptor by macrophages is a
pharmacologic end point elicited by FcgR
interactions with T cell–bound antibody
complexes.
To assess whether the PD-1 receptor
is transferred during aPD-1 removal,
PD-1+ T cells were exposed to unlabeled
aPD-1, cocultured with macrophages (to
enable aPD-1 capture), and reprobed for
cell surface PD-1 expression with a fluo-
rescent aPD-1 mAb. Transfer of unlabeled
aPD-1 together with PD-1 would pre-
vent PD-1 detection upon reprobing with
fluorescent aPD-1. Instead, T cells from
which aPD-1 had been captured were effi-
ciently reprobed, indicating that aPD-1 re-
moval frees up PD-1 molecules, which
become available to fluorescent aPD-1 mAb
(fig. S12A). Control experiments confirmed
that the increased reprobing signal was not
contributed by new PD-1 molecules on
the surface of T cells (fig. S12B). Together,
these data indicate that PD-1 remains on
the T cell membrane after aPD-1 capture.
Because Fc/FcgR binding interactions
of many IgG subclassesdependupon mAb
Fc glycosylation (27), we profiled the glycan
structures from the murine aPD-1 mAb
(29F.1A12) and further extended our anal-
ysis to the human aPD-1 mAb nivolumab. Both antibodies were treated
with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), a glycosidase that cleaves N-
linked glycan, to remove glycan from each antibody, and the digested

 products were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) (Fig. 5A). We found that murine and human aPD-1 mAbs share
the same predominant glycoform that lacks terminal galactose residues
(G0F) and is fucosylated on the penultimate N-acetylglucosamine (fig.
S13). Both mouse and human aPD-1 contained substantial fractions of
terminally galactosylated glycoforms, indicating a high degree of Fc gly-
can heterogeneity in these aPD-1 mAb preparations.
ThesimilarityinglycanpatternbetweenmouseandhumanaPD-1mAbs
led us to hypothesize that FcgR-mediated antibody transfer is relevant
to human aPD-1 interactions. We fluorescently labeled the anti-human
PD-1 mAb nivolumab with AF647 and adapted the in vitro coculture
system(Fig.4B)toprimaryhumancells.Wedifferentiatedhumanmacro-
phages from blood monocytes using macrophage colony-stimulating
factor, and PD-1–expressing CD8+ T cells were generated by isolating
primary human CD8+ T cells and stimulating them with plate-bound
aCD3 mAbs for 3 days. Coculture of AF647-nivolumab–labeled human
CD8+ T cells with macrophages resulted in mAb transfer from CD8+
T cells to macrophages (movie S4), and the transfer was inhibited by
blocking FcgRs using aFcgRIIB/III (Fig. 5B). There was no evidence
of CD8+ T cell membrane components in the macrophages, consistent
with the antibody alone being removed from the surface PD-1 receptor
(fig. S14). Furthermore, blocking FcgRs decreased AF647-nivolumab
puncta inside of macrophages, implying that FcgRs also regulate nivo-
lumab uptake in human cells (Fig. 5C).
Improving immunotherapy
In an attempt to minimize aPD-1/FcgR interactions, we used PNGase F
to remove the glycan from murine aPD-1 mAbs and confirmed cleavage
of glycan by lens culinaris agglutinin lectin blot (fig. S15A). The PNGase
F–treated aPD-1 was labeled with AF647, and flow cytometry confirmed
that the presence of glycan was not required for aPD-1 tropism because
PD-1+ T cells were still efficiently labeled with PNGase F–treated AF647–
aPD-1 (fig. S15B). However, live cell imaging demonstrated that glycan
removal diminished antibody transfer from T cells to macrophages (Fig.
6A), andtheseresultswere confirmedby flowcytometry(Fig. 6,B andC).
We then aimed to uncover the in vivo activity of aPD-1 mAbs when
aPD-1/FcgR interactions were therapeutically inhibited. To this end, we
tracked aPD-1, CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and tumor cells in mice in
which we inhibited FcgRs by infusing FcgRIIb/III blocking antibodies
(2.4G2 clone) before delivering AF647–aPD-1 mAbs (Fig. 6D). We
found that administration of the FcgR blocking agent substantially pro-
longed the occupancy time of AF647–aPD-1 mAbs on CD8+ T cells in
the tumor bed (Fig. 6E). Furthermore, whereas the response of MC38
tumors to aPD-1 therapy typically varies among animals (fig. S16),
blocking FcgR interactions completely eliminated the fraction of
nonresponders observed, with complete tumor rejection in all mice
that received the combination treatment (Fig. 6F). These data provide
evidence that mAb/FcgR interactions abbreviate aPD-1 mAb occupancy
time on tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and limit therapy response; con-
versely, aPD-1 mAb therapy can be improved by blocking FcgR interac-
tions (fig. S17).
DISCUSSION
Many cancer patients do not respond to immune checkpoint blockade
therapy, and we lack a complete understanding of the mechanisms that

 contribute to treatment efficacy and resistance. Here, by using time-
lapse intravital microscopy, we uncovered in real time how the immune
checkpoint blocker aPD-1 mAb distributes in tumors and physically
interacts with tumor microenvironment components. This approach
enabled us to detect aPD-1 mAb association with cytotoxic T cells in-
filtrating tumors in vivo. Furthermore, by following the drug’s pharma-
cokinetics over time, we found the drug to be rapidly removed from
PD-1+ CD8+ T cells and transferred to neighboring PD-1− TAMs. The
transfer of aPD-1 mAbs from T cells to macrophages was unexpected
because macrophages do not directly take up aPD-1 mAbs in culture.
We further identified that aPD-1 uptake by macrophages depends both
on the Fc domain of the antibody and on FcgRs expressed by macro-
phages. Interactions between the drugs and macrophages are likely im-
portant because blocking Fc/FcgR binding inhibited aPD-1 transfer
from CD8+ T cells to macrophages in vivo and enhanced aPD-1 thera-
peutic efficacy.
Although clinical aPD-1 has an extensive circulation half-life
(~26 days), our observations suggest that the time of target engagement
in the local tumor environment may be much shorter. This engagement
time is reduced at least in part by FcgRII/III, which mediate aPD-1 mAb
uptake from T cells to macrophages. Accordingly, previous work in
mice has shown that IgG2a isotypes preferentially bind FcgRIIb/III
and that aPD-1 therapy with an IgG2a mAb is more effective in FcgRIIb
knockout animals (25). Our studies further suggest that FcgR-mediated
aPD-1 removal does not involve transfer of cell membrane components
or trogocytosis, which has been described for other mAbs including
rituximab (27, 28). However, we found that aPD-1 uptake by macro-
phages is favored when the mAb is bound to PD-1 on T cells, which
aligns with previous findings that FcgRs bind IgGs more efficiently
whentheyformimmunecomplexes(29,30).WealsofoundthatPD-1re-
mains on the T cell surface after aPD-1 removal, but we did not observe
these PD-1 molecules to bind new aPD-1. Overall, aPD-1 transfer from
T cells to macrophages appears to be faster than aPD-1 uptake by T cells
in the tumor stoma.
The human aPD-1 drugs nivolumab and pembrolizumab were de-
signed as human IgG4 antibody isotypes that are not known to fix
complement or trigger antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
(ADCC) (31). However, IgG4 can bind FcgRI and FcgRIIb, and these
interactions can have profound clinical consequences (32, 33). Awareness
of the FcgR binding profile of an mAb offers an opportunity to improve
upon existing monoclonal therapies, exemplified by obinutuzumab, a de-
fucosylated IgG1 biosimilar of rituximab designed to bind FcgRIIIA and
enhance ADCC against CD20+ cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(34). Human germline variants of FcgRs that display altered Fc binding
tropism have been identified and are an important focus in the effort to
understandresponsestomAbtherapiesthatrelyonFcgRsfortherapeutic

mAb therapies (38).
We suggest that nivolumab and other IgG4-based mAbs are not ex-
ceptions to the rules of FcgR binding, and therefore, Fc interactions
should be considered in pharmacologic models. This is particularly im-
portant because there is growing interest in immune checkpoint mole-
cules as diagnostic tools to identify PD-1/PD-L1+ tumors. For example,
previous efforts to image PD-1 expression using positron emission to-
mography (PET) radioligands have focused on gross tissue distribution
and lack the resolution to identify cellulartropisms in vivo. Natarajan et al.
used hamster anti-mouse PD-1 (39), but it is not fully understood how
hamster mAbs interact with mouse FcgRs in this context. A secondary
aPD-1 PET imaging study reported the use of the RMP1-14 rat IgG2a
anti-mouse PD-1 clone to cross-correlate with ex vivo PD-1 staining (40),
but drug withdrawal by macrophages could complicate the relationship
between PET signal and PD-1 expression. Future preclinical diagnostic
efforts to image PD-1 expression should consider imaging agents that
avoid FcgR interactions; however, antibodies meant to mimic nivolumab
and pembrolizumab should accurately represent the Fc status of the
human IgG4 antibodies.
The findings from the present study also have potential implications
for improving current treatment options. From our understanding of Fc
interactions with aPD-1, Fc-engineered IgG variants that abrogate FcgR
binding and mAb effector functions (41) or combinations with therapies
that inhibit FcgR binding in vivo may enhance the effects of treatment. In
addition, therapies designed to target tumor macrophages (18), when
combined with aPD-1, may provide additional benefit by increasing im-
mune checkpoint blockade drug delivery to CD8+ T cells, thereby en-
hancing activity of immunotherapy. Clinical trials combining macrophage
targeting therapeutics and immune checkpoint blockers are underway (42)
andshouldanswerthisquestion.Insupportofthenotionthatmyeloidcells
interface with aPD-1 immunotherapy, recently identified correlates of
aPD-1 response in tumors suggest that alterations in macrophage gene sig-
natures are associated with nonresponsiveness to aPD-1 (43).
Comparisons between mouse and human Fc/Fc receptor inter-
actions are complex because both antibody Fc isotypes and Fc receptor
biological functions are divergent between species. Our initial findings
in mice, which established the basic principle of Fc receptor–mediated
antibody transfer, were recapitulated using primary human cells and
nivolumab. However, it will be important to understand the impact
of such interactions in patients. In addition, one should clarify whether
all macrophages, or only a subset thereof, contribute to mAb uptake in
tumors. Our understanding of the complexity of macrophages and other
myeloid cells remains limited (18), and it is possible that those with dis-
crete phenotypes, for example, with distinct proportions of activating ver-
sus inhibitory Fc receptors, play different roles in response to immune
checkpoint blockade therapy (44). Uncovering the mechanisms that con-
trol mAb drug interactions with host cells is an ongoing challenge, al-
though the findings could have far-reaching consequences for diagnostic
and therapeutic approaches.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The objective of this study was to understand the binding tropism of
aPD-1 mAb therapy in tumors. Flow cytometry, ex vivo microscopy,
and intravital microscopy techniques were used for longitudinal inves-
tigation of checkpoint blockade pharmacokinetics. The expectation was
that the fluorescently tagged drug would allow tumor-infiltrating lym-
phocytes to be tracked during pharmacodynamic response; however,
accumulation of drug in TAMs prompted us to hypothesize that the Fc
region of these mAbs can also affect the drug biodistribution. All in vitro
and in vivo studies were performed using C57BL/6J mice, and human
primary cells were collected from healthy volunteers for ex vivo studies.
Sample sizeswere decidedusing data from preliminary caliper measure-
ments of tumor growth (SD = 25% with a 99% difference between treat-
mentandcontrolgroups;a =0.05,b =0.2).DatawereanalyzedbyGrubbs’
test for statistical outliers, which were predefined using an a value of 0.01.
Data are representative of at least three independent experiments, as in-
dicated in the figure legends. Treatment cohorts were assigned to ensure
thattumorsweresize-matchedatthestartoftheintervention.Calipermea-
surements were acquired by researchers blinded to the intervention and
groupallocation.Microscopyimagingwasperformedunblindedusingpre-
determined data collection methods that allowed multiple regions to be
studied for each sample, permitting thousands of cells to be analyzed.
Animal models
Animal research was performed in accordance with the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committees at Massachusetts General Hospital
(MGH). DPE-GFP mice (21) were provided by U. von Andrian (De-
partment of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Harvard Medical
School). IFN-g reporter with endogenous polyadenylated tail (GREAT)
mice (22) were provided by A. Luster (Division of Rheumatology, Allergy
and Immunology, MGH). Tumor growth was monitored by caliper mea-
surement, and the area (A) of these predominantly two-dimensional
tumors was calculated using the formula A = length × width. Tumor
implantation was performed by intradermal injection of tumor cells
(2 × 106 MC38/MC38–H2B-mApple, 5 × 105 B16-F1–ovalbumin, and
5 × 105 KP1.9). MC38 cells were gifted by M. Smyth (QIMR Berghofer,
Brisbane, Australia), B16 cells were from American Type Culture Collec-
tion, and KP1.9 cells were a gift from A. Zippelius (University Hospital
Basel, Switzerland). Experiments were generally started when tumors
became vascularized, which was after 8 days. For aPD-1 and AF647–
aPD-1 treatments, mice were given 200 mg (intraperitoneally) of the
29F.1A12 aPD-1 clone. For in vivo Fc blocking experiments, mice were
infused intraperitoneally with 200 mg of monoclonal antibody specific to
mouseFcgRIIandFcgRIII(clone2.4G2,Bioxcell)dailyfor5days.Control
mice received 200 mg of rat IgG2a isotype control (clone 2A3, Bioxcell).
In vivo microscopy
Intravital microscopy was performed in dorsal skinfold window
chambers installed on DPE-GFP or GREAT mice inoculated with
MC38–H2B-mApple tumors. Mouse macrophages and/or vasculature
were labeled with Pacific Blue–ferumoxytol and Pacific Blue–dextran,
respectively. AF647–aPD-1 (200 mg) was delivered intravenously, and
its tumor distribution was observed using an Olympus FluoView
FV1000MPE confocal imaging system (Olympus America), as de-
scribed previously (45). Pacific Blue, GFP/YFP, mApple, and AF647
were imaged sequentially using 405-, 473-, 559-, and 635-nm lasers
and BA430-455, BA490-540, BA575-620, and BA575-675 emission
filters with DM473, SDM560, and SDM640 beam splitters, all sourced
from Olympus America. Time-lapse images were acquired continually
over the first hour after AF647–aPD-1 injection, after which the mice
were allowed to recover before subsequent imaging.
Statistical analysis
Data points were compiled in Microsoft Excel, and statistical analyses
were performed using GraphPad Prism 6. a levels of 0.05 were used to
