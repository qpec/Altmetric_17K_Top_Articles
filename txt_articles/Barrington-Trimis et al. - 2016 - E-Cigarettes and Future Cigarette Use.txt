abstract
BACKGROUND: There has been little research examining whether e-cigarette use increases the 
risk of cigarette initiation among adolescents in the transition to adulthood when the sale of 
cigarettes becomes legal.
METHODS: The Children’s Health Study is a prospectively followed cohort in Southern 
California. Data on e-cigarette use were collected in 11th and 12th grade (mean age = 
17.4); follow-up data on tobacco product use were collected an average of 16 months later 
from never-smoking e-cigarette users at initial evaluation (n = 146) and from a sample of 
never-smoking, never e-cigarette users (n = 152) frequency matched to e-cigarette users on 
gender, ethnicity, and grade.
RESULTS: Cigarette initiation during follow-up was reported by 40.4% of e-cigarette users 
(n = 59) and 10.5% of never users (n = 16). E-cigarette users had 6.17 times (95% confidence 
interval: 3.30–11.6) the odds of initiating cigarettes as never e-cigarette users. Results were 
robust to adjustment for potential confounders and in analyses restricted to never users 
of any combustible tobacco product. Associations were stronger in adolescents with no 
intention of smoking at initial evaluation. E-cigarette users were also more likely to initiate 
use of any combustible product (odds ratio = 4.98; 95% confidence interval: 2.37–10.4), 
including hookah, cigars, or pipes.
CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette use in never-smoking youth may increase risk of subsequent 
initiation of cigarettes and other combustible products during the transition to adulthood 
when the purchase of tobacco products becomes legal. Stronger associations in participants 
with no intention of smoking suggests that e-cigarette use was not simply a marker for 
individuals who would have gone on to smoke regardless of e-cigarette use.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Three studies 
have found associations between e-cigarette use 
and subsequent cigarette use in adolescents. 
However, the risk of initiation of cigarettes as 
adolescents reach an age at which the purchase of 
tobacco products becomes legal is unknown.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Adolescents who reported 
e-cigarette use had more than six times the odds 
of initiating cigarette use as never e-cigarette 
users. These fi
 ndings suggest e-cigarette use may 
increase the risk of smoking during the transition to 
adulthood.

Adolescent use of e-cigarettes has 
increased rapidly in recent years, 
1 
with several studies reporting 
higher rates of e-cigarette use than 
combustible cigarette use among 
high school students in 2014.1–6 
Among high school students in the 
National Youth Tobacco Survey, 
13.4% of adolescents reported 
past 30-day use of e-cigarettes 
in 2014, compared with 9.2% of 
adolescents who reported past 
30-day use of cigarettes.1 Among 
high school students participating 
in the Southern California Children’s 
Health Study (CHS), we found that 
24.0% had ever tried e-cigarettes 
(including 9.6% who reported use 
in the past 30 days), compared with 
18.7% who had tried cigarettes 
(5.7% in the past 30 days); >40% of 
e-cigarette users had never smoked 
a combustible cigarette.6 A critical 
question is whether e-cigarette use in 
adolescents who have never smoked 
cigarettes will lead to subsequent 
initiation of cigarette or other 
combustible product use.
The initial data addressing this 
question came from several cross-
sectional studies that examined the 
association between e-cigarette use 
and self-reported intention to use 
cigarettes among adolescents with 
no previous history of cigarette use, 
using validated survey measures.7–13 
E-cigarette users, representing 
several age groups and geographic 
locations, had 2 to 4 times the odds 
of indicating an intention to use 
cigarettes as never users, 
7, 
8 results 
consistent with those we reported 
in the CHS.9 To date there have been 
3 reports from prospective cohort 
studies examining the relationship 
between e-cigarette use and 
subsequent initiation of combustible 
cigarette use in adolescence, 
including a study of 9th-grade 
students (mean age 14.1), 
14 a second 
study of 9th and 10th-grade students 
(mean age 14.7), 
15 and another 
small study of 16- to 26-year-olds, 
with few never-smoking e-cigarette 
users at baseline that was not able 
to examine associations within 
specific developmental periods in 
this age range.16 All studies found 
that e-cigarette use was associated 
with elevated risk of initiation of 
combustible cigarettes. However, 
the risk of initiation of combustible 
cigarettes is likely to vary by age17; 
the developmental context of 
the end of high school is unique, 
because those turning 18 face 
particular challenges associated 
with the transition to adulthood, 
including postsecondary education or 
employment seeking, which co-occur 
at the age (18 years) at which 
the purchase of tobacco products 
becomes legal.
We examined whether e-cigarette 
use among older adolescents in 
the transition to adulthood leads 
to greater likelihood of initiation 
of cigarettes as they reach the legal 
age to purchase cigarettes. We 
used prospective data from the 
CHS, a population-based cohort of 
adolescents from whom data on 
e-cigarette use were first collected 
in grades 11 or 12 (mean age 17.4) 
in spring of 2014, to examine risk 
of initiation of combustible tobacco 
products at follow-up (median 15.6 
months later). We hypothesized that 
never-smoking e-cigarette users in 
this critical age range would be more 
likely than never-smoking never 
e-cigarette users to begin using 
combustible cigarettes during the 
subsequent year.
METHODS
Study Design and Sample
Participants enrolled in the CHS 
completed the initial evaluation 
questionnaire in school classrooms 
when they were in 11th or 12th 
grade. Questionnaires were 
completed with study staff 
supervision between January 
2014 and June 2014, when use of 
e-cigarettes was first assessed in the 
cohort.6, 
18 To maximize efficiency 
in the design of the prospective 
follow-up study to evaluate the risk 
of cigarette and other combustible 
tobacco product initiation associated 
with e-cigarette use, we used an 
exposure frequency-matched cohort 
study design in which we contacted 
never-smoking e-cigarette users 
and a sample of never-smoking 
never e-cigarette users to complete 
a follow-up questionnaire (Fig 1). 
We attempted to contact all never-
smoking e-cigarette users (n = 213) 
and a randomly selected frequency 
matched sample of never-smoking, 
never e-cigarette users (n = 213) 
from among all never-smoking never 
e-cigarette users in the cohort at 
initial evaluation; never-users were 
frequency matched to e-cigarette 
users by gender, ethnicity, and 
grade (11 or 12). Participants 
completed an online follow-up 
questionnaire between February 
2015 and March 2016. Follow-up 
questionnaires were completed 
by 149 (70.0%) e-cigarette users 
and 154 (72.3%) never e-cigarette 
users; 146 e-cigarette users and 152 
never users provided complete data 
on their use of cigarettes between 
initial evaluation and follow-up 
and were included in analyses. All 
participants were 18 years of age 
or older at follow-up. Participants 
turning 18 were sent a link to the 
follow-up online survey by e-mail 
(using e-mail address provided 
at the 11th- and 12th-grade data 
collection); additional attempts to 
contact participants were made by 
text message and telephone calls. 
Those not responding or who had not 
provided other contact information 
were sent letters soliciting 
participation to the last known 
residential address or were contacted 
through parents or other contacts 
previously provided by participants.
Ethics Statement
The study was approved by the 
University of Southern California 
Institutional Review Board.

Participants aged 18 or older 
provided written informed consent. 
Written parental informed consent 
and student assent were obtained 
for all CHS participants before data 
collection in 2014.
Measures
Tobacco and Alternative Tobacco 
Product Use
At each survey, participants were 
asked whether they had ever tried 
e-cigarettes, cigarettes, cigars, pipes, 
or hookah and the number of days 
each product was used in the past 30 
days.6 Participants who had “never 
tried” a product (not “even 1 or 2 
puffs”) were classified as “never 
users.” Those reporting an age at 
first use of each tobacco product 
were classified as “ever users” of that 
product. All analyses were restricted 
to never cigarette smokers at initial 
evaluation.
Sociodemographic Characteristics
Self-administered questionnaires 
completed by parents of 
participants18 were used to assess 
gender, ethnicity (Hispanic, non-
Hispanic white, other), and parental 
education (highest level of education 
of either parent; <12th grade, 
high school diploma or general 
equivalency diploma, some college, 
college degree, some graduate school 
or higher).
Susceptibility to Cigarette Use
Susceptibility to tobacco product use 
has been defined as the absence of a 
firm commitment not to smoke.10, 
11, 
13 
In the current study, susceptibility 
to future cigarette use was assessed 
using validated measures (see 
Supplemental Material). Adolescents 
were classified as having no 
susceptibility if they responded 
“definitely not” to questions about 
intention to initiate use of cigarettes 
in the future.10
Social Environment
The cigarette social environment 
was evaluated based on the following 
questions: (1) “How many of your 
4 closest friends use [cigarettes]?” 
(0–4 friends); (2) “How would your 
best friends act toward you if you 
used [cigarettes]?” (very unfriendly, 
unfriendly, friendly, or very friendly); 
and (3) “Does anyone who lives 
with you now use [cigarettes]?” 
(yes/no). These factors have been 
strongly associated with cigarette 
use17 and more recently have been 
associated with e-cigarette use in 
the CHS.6
Statistical Analysis
On the basis of prospectively 
collected data, we used unconditional 
logistic regression models to 
evaluate the association between 
e-cigarette use at initial evaluation 
and subsequent cigarette use at 
follow-up. Odds ratios (ORs) and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
were used to estimate the odds of 
smoking initiation. All models were 
adjusted for gender, ethnicity, grade 
and highest parental education, 
factors that have been associated 
both with e-cigarette use and 
cigarette use in previous studies.17, 
19 
Potential confounding by history of 
combustible tobacco use other than 
cigarettes at initial evaluation, social 
environment characteristics, age at 
initial evaluation, age at follow-up, 
and time from initial evaluation to 
follow-up (in months) was evaluated 
on the basis of a change in effect 
estimate of >10% with inclusion of 
any of these variables. A missing 
indicator category was included 
where appropriate. Formal tests of 
interaction were used to evaluate 
whether effect estimates differed by 
gender, ethnicity (Hispanic white, 
non-Hispanic white, other), grade 
(11 or 12), ever use of hookah 
(a combustible product that has 
been previously associated with

e-cigarette use, 
20 yes versus no), or 
susceptibility to smoking at 
initial evaluation (yes vs no). 
Additional analyses evaluated the 
risk of initiation of any combustible 
tobacco product (cigarettes, cigars, 
hookah, or pipes) associated with 
e-cigarette use at initial evaluation. 
Polytomous regression models 
were used to evaluate the risk of 
initiation of cigarette use (but no 
use in the past 30 days) and the 
risk of past 30-day cigarette use, 
relative to participants not initiating 
use of cigarettes. In sensitivity 
analyses, models evaluating the 
risk of initiation of cigarettes 
were restricted to nonusers of any 
combustible tobacco product at 
initial evaluation (cigarettes, 
cigars, hookah, pipes). All 
statistical analyses were based 
on 2-sided hypotheses tested at 
a .05 level of significance. 
Analyses were performed using 
SAS 9.4.
Role of the Funding Source
The funder had no role in the 
design and conduct of the study; 
collection, management, analysis, 
or interpretation of the data; or 
preparation, review, or approval of 
the manuscript.
RESULTS
E-cigarette users and never users 
were similar on matching factors 
(gender, ethnicity, grade) and 
parental education. In adjusted 
models males were more likely to 
initiate cigarette use (OR = 1.84; 95% 
CI: 1.04–3.26; Table 1). Adolescents 
who were classified as susceptible 
to cigarette use were more likely 
to report e-cigarette use at initial 
evaluation (OR = 2.48; 95% CI: 
1.44–4.27) and to report cigarette 
use at follow-up (OR = 3.03; 95% 
CI: 1.71–5.39). Having one or more 
friends who smoked combustible 
tobacco products also increased the 
likelihood of e-cigarette use at initial 
evaluation (OR = 2.61; 95% CI: 1.35–
5.06) and cigarette use at follow-up 
(OR = 2.58; 95% CI: 1.30–5.09); 
having friends who were friendly to 
cigarette use was associated with 
e-cigarette use at initial evaluation 
(OR = 2.13; 95% CI: 1.24–3.65) but 
not with cigarette use at follow-up. 
The median age of participants at 
initial evaluation was 17.4 years 
(interquartile range [IQR]: 16.8–
17.9); median age at follow-up was 
18.6 years (IQR: 18.3–19.0 years); 
median time from initial evaluation 
to follow-up was 15.6 months (IQR: 
12.6–18.2 months).
To assess the potential for selection 
bias, we compared sociodemographic 
characteristics of study participants 
for whom follow-up data were 
obtained with those lost to follow-up. 
Participants from whom follow-up 
data were collected were more

likely to have a parent with at least 
a college education (Supplemental 
Table 5). No notable differences 
in gender, ethnicity, grade, or 
susceptibility to cigarette use 
were observed between retained 
participants and those lost to 
follow up.
Among never e-cigarette users at 
initial evaluation, 16 (10.5%) 
reported use of cigarettes at 
follow-up; among ever e-cigarette 
users at the initial evaluation, 
59 (40.4%) reported use of 
cigarettes at follow-up (Table 2). 
The adjusted OR for the association 
of e-cigarette use with subsequent 
smoking of combustible cigarettes 
was 6.17 (95% CI: 3.30–11.6). After 
further adjustment for cigar, pipe, 
or hookah use at initial evaluation, 
the association of e-cigarette 
use with subsequent smoking 
was slightly attenuated but still 
statistically significant (OR = 5.48; 
95% CI: 2.69–11.2). Results did not 
differ appreciably after additional 
adjustment for social environment 
characteristics at initial evaluation 
(whether others in the home smoked, 
number of friends who smoked, 
friends’ attitudes toward smoking), 
age at initial evaluation, age at 
follow-up, or time in months from 
initial evaluation to follow-up (results 
not shown). E-cigarette users had 
5.49 times (95% CI: 2.68–11.2) the 
odds of initiating cigarette smoking 
but not having smoked in the past 
30 days, and 7.50 times (95% CI: 
2.41–23.4) the odds of reporting 
use of cigarettes in the past 30 days 
at follow-up compared with never 
e-cigarette users. Estimates were 
based on 39 (27.1%) initiators and 18 
(12.5%) past 30-day cigarette users 
among e-cigarette users at baseline, 
compared with 12 (7.9%) initiators 
and 4 (2.6%) past 30-day cigarette 
users among never e-cigarette users 
at baseline; 2 participants reported 
initiation of smoking but did not 
report the number of days smoked 
in the past 30 days (results not 
tabulated).
Among adolescents who were not 
classified as susceptible to cigarette 
use at initial evaluation, 36.2% 
(n = 34) of e-cigarette users and 5.7% 
(n = 7) of never e-cigarette users 
reported initiation of cigarettes at 
follow up (ORnot susceptible = 9.69; 95% 
CI: 4.02–23.4; Table 3). In contrast, 
among those who were classified 
as susceptible to smoking at initial 
evaluation, e-cigarette users were 
only slightly more likely to initiate 
cigarette use at follow-up (47.1% 
v. 32.1%; ORsusceptible = 2.12; 95% 
CI: 0.79, 5.74; interaction P = .03). 
We also examined interactions of 
e-cigarette use at initial evaluation 
with gender, ethnicity, grade 
level, time from initial contact 
to completion of follow-up 
questionnaire, and use of hookah 
at initial evaluation. The risk of 
initiation of cigarette use associated 
with e-cigarettes did not differ by 
these characteristics.
In an analysis restricted to those 
who reported no use of any 
combustible tobacco product at 
initial evaluation, e-cigarette users 
were also more likely to initiate use 
of any combustible tobacco product 
at follow-up (OR = 4.98; 95% CI: 
2.37–10.4; Table 4) and to initiate 
use of cigarettes (OR = 4.29; 95% CI: 
1.84–10.0), hookah (OR = 2.86; 95% 
CI: 1.21–6.78), cigars (OR = 4.39; 
95% CI: 1.72–11.2), and pipes (OR = 
8.21; 95% CI: 1.20–56.2).

DISCUSSION
We prospectively evaluated the risk 
of smoking initiation associated with 
e-cigarette use in the transition to 
adulthood when it becomes legal to 
purchase cigarettes. In this sample 
of never cigarette users at initial 
evaluation, >40% of e-cigarette users 
initiated cigarette use during the 
16-month (average) follow-up. Those 
who reported e-cigarette use had >6 
times the odds of initiating cigarette 
use as never e-cigarette users. The 
associations remained statistically 
significant after adjustment for 
use of other combustible tobacco 
products at study entry and for 
social environmental factors. The 
increased risk of smoking initiation 
associated with previous e-cigarette 
use was also observed in sensitivity 
analyses restricted to never-users 
of any combustible tobacco product 
at initial evaluation; moreover, 
risk of subsequent initiation of 
any combustible tobacco product 
was also increased. Notably, the 
association of e-cigarettes with 
initiation of cigarette use was much 
stronger among those classified 
as not susceptible to becoming 
smokers. These findings suggest that 
e-cigarette use may promote smoking 
during the transition to adulthood, 
even in those considered to be at 
lower risk because of personal or 
environmental factors.
Three studies on the longitudinal 
association between e-cigarette 
use and subsequent cigarette use 
among adolescents have been 
published.14–16 In the first, among 
ninth-grade students (mean age 14.1 
years) with no history of combustible 
tobacco product use at initial 
evaluation, those who reported ever 
use of e-cigarettes had 1.75 (95% CI: 
1.10–2.77) times the odds as never 
users of reporting subsequent use of 
cigarettes 12 months later, and 2.73 
(95% CI: 2.00–3.73) times the odds 
of reporting use of any combustible 
tobacco product after adjustment for 
ever use of nonnicotine or tobacco 
substances, smoking expectancies 
(whether adolescents think they 
will enjoy smoking, or feel bad from 
smoking), and other potentially 
confounding characteristics at study 
entry.14 The second study was also 
among younger youth in grades 9 
and 10 at baseline (mean age 14.7 
years) and found similar results: 
e-cigarette users had 2.87 (95% 
CI: 2.03–4.05) times the odds of 
initiating combustible cigarette use 
between baseline and follow-up 
1 year later as never users, after 
adjustment for age, gender, ethnicity, 
parental education, parental support, 
and rebelliousness.15 The third 
study found similar prospective 
associations in adolescents and 
young adults 16 to 26 years of age 
who reported being nonsusceptible 
to smoking at baseline, but the 
estimates were based on only 16 
never-smoking e-cigarette users 
at initial evaluation.16 The current 
results extend the literature by 
showing that these associations 
generalize to the period at the 
end of high school. Our findings, 
together with those from the other 
prospective studies of youth and 
young adult populations, suggest 
that e-cigarette use is a clear and 
consistent indicator of likelihood of 
subsequent initiation of cigarette 
and other combustible tobacco 
product use at ages spanning from 
early adolescence through emerging 
adulthood.
It is possible in principle that 
e-cigarette use among never 
smoking adolescents is a marker 
for those who would have begun 
to smoke even if e-cigarettes were 
not available. In these adolescents, 
the availability of e-cigarettes use 
may have delayed the initiation of 
smoking among those who would 
have gone on to smoke anyway. 
However, the risk of smoking 
associated with e-cigarette use was 
even higher among participants who 
reported no intention to smoke at 
initial assessment than among the 
group of adolescents who indicated 
they were likely to begin smoking. 
Among nonsusceptible individuals, 
36% of e-cigarette users initiated 
cigarette use, compared with only 
6% of nonusers (Table 3). Another 
recent study found that e-cigarette 
users had different psychological 
profiles than cigarette users.21, 
22 
Together, these findings suggest

that e-cigarettes are not merely a 
marker for individuals who would 
have gone on to smoke combustible 
cigarettes, regardless of the 
availability of e-cigarettes, but that 
e-cigarette use is likely introducing 
new youth to tobacco products and 
is increasing the likelihood of future 
smoking among the low-risk group 
who expressed confidence that they 
would not do so.
It is also possible that e-cigarette 
users who initiated smoking were 
more likely to be experimenting 
with cigarettes and less likely than 
other initiators to progress to 
regular cigarette use and nicotine 
dependence. The duration of 
follow-up and small sample size 
(particularly among never e-cigarette 
users who began smoking) was 
insufficient to fully address this 
question. However, the prospective 
association of e-cigarette use with 
cigarette use in the past 30 days was 
similar to that for initiation but no 
use in the past 30 days. These results 
provide no evidence that e-cigarette 
users who initiate smoking are any 
less likely to progress to regular use 
of cigarettes than youth who did not 
begin tobacco use with e-cigarettes.
There are some uncertainties to 
the conclusions from this study. 
Participants who were lost to 
follow-up were less likely to have 
a parent with at least a college 
education. However, in analyses 
examining whether the risk of 
initiation of smoking associated 
with e-cigarette use differed by 
education, no interaction was 
observed, nor were the estimates of 
effect of e-cigarette use on cigarette 
initiation confounded by education; 
thus, differential loss to follow-up in 
the cohort seems unlikely to be an 
explanation for the observed results. 
We did not collect information on 
type of e-cigarette used or nicotine 
content of e-cigarette at initial 
evaluation, factors that may increase 
the likelihood of transition from 
e-cigarette to cigarette or other 
combustible tobacco use. Although 
the study addresses a potentially 
vulnerable age range, results may not 
be generalizable to older populations 
or to other geographic regions. 
Finally, because the rate of initiation 
of cigarette use in never e-cigarette 
users was low in our Southern 
California population (10.5% based 
on 16 new users), the odds ratio 
associated with e-cigarette use was 
not precisely estimated. However, the 
associations were large and highly 
statistically significant.
There are several plausible 
mechanisms through which 
e-cigarette use in adolescence may 
lead to subsequent initiation of 
cigarettes or other combustible 
tobacco products.17, 
23, 
24 E-cigarettes 
may lead to initiation of use of other 
combustible products because 
flavorings desensitize users’ lungs 
to the harsh and aversive effects 
of nicotine inhalation, providing a 
more gradual transition from never 
smoking to use of combustible 
cigarettes or other combustible 
products. Flavorings, in combination 
with devices appealing to youth in 
this technological age (eg, “techie” 
e-devices with programmable 
settings) may act to promote smoking 
initiation among adolescents and 
may also play a role in product use 
maintenance or progression to 
greater levels of use. Regular use 
of nicotine, and the development of 
nicotine dependence, may also lead 
adolescents to seek other forms of 
nicotine. Adolescents first introduced 
to nicotine via e-cigarettes may 
develop a dependence on nicotine 
and may then move on to other forms 
of nicotine, including cigarettes 
or other combustible products. 
Individuals genetically susceptible to 
the addictive properties of nicotine 
may be at particularly high risk. 
Finally, rapid increases in e-cigarette 
use in adolescent populations have 
already begun to contribute to 
the normalization of e-cigarette 
use, which indirectly functions to 
normalize “smoking-like” behaviors 
more generally (eg, clouds of smoke/
vapor in public places become 
normative). The normalization of 
these social behaviors may facilitate 
initiation of cigarette smoking if 
society becomes more accepting of 
alternative tobacco product use.
Future work exploring these and 
other mechanisms through which 
e-cigarette use in adolescence may 
influence willingness to initiate 
cigarette smoking is warranted. 
Regardless of the mechanisms 
underlying the associations of 
e-cigarettes with cigarette use, 
this research adds much needed 
data to the emerging evidence that 
e-cigarettes are associated with 
increased risk of smoking among 
adolescents. Because e-cigarette use 
is common in adolescents and young 
adults, further prospective follow-up 
of this and other cohorts is needed 
to determine whether e-cigarette 
use will increase population rates 
of cigarette and other combustible 
tobacco products and their associated 
burden of disease.
