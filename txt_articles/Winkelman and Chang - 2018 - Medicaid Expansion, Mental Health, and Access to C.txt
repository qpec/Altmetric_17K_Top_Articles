BACKGROUND: While the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA)
Medicaid expansion has increased insurance cover-
age, its effects on health outcomes have been mixed.
This may be because previous research did not dis-
aggregate mental and physical health or target pop-
ulations most likely to benefit.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between
Medicaid expansion and changes in mental health,
physical health, and access to care among low-
income childless adults with and without chronic
conditions.
DESIGN: We used a difference-in-differences analyti-
cal framework to assess differential changes in self-
reported health outcomes and access to care. We
stratified our analyses by chronic condition status.
PARTICIPANTS: Childless adults, aged 18–64, with
incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level in
expansion (n = 69,620) and non-expansion states
(n = 57,628).
INTERVENTION: Active Medicaid expansion in state of
residence.
MAIN MEASURES: Self-reported general health; total
days in past month with poor health, poor mental
health, poor physical health, or health-related activ-
ity restrictions; disability; depression; insurance cov-
erage; cost-related barriers; annual check-up; and
personal doctor.
KEY RESULTS: Medicaid expansion was associated
with reductions in poor health days (−1.2 days
[95% CI, −1.6,-0.7]) and days limited by poor health
(−0.94 days [95% CI, −1.4,-0.43]), but only among
adults with chronic conditions. Trends in general
health measures appear to be driven by fewer poor
mental health days (−1.1 days [95% CI, −1.6,-0.6]).
Expansion was also associated with a reduction in
depression diagnoses (−3.4 percentage points [95%
CI, −6.1,-0.01]) among adults with chronic condi-
tions. Expansion was associated with improvements
in access to care for all adults.
CONCLUSIONS: Medicaid expansion was associated with
substantial improvements in mental health and access to
care among low-income adults with chronic conditions.
These positive trends are likely to be reversed if Medicaid
expansion is repealed.

INTRODUCTION
Twenty-six states plus the District of Columbia expanded their
Medicaid programs through the Affordable Care Act in
2014, and three additional states (Pennsylvania, Indiana, and
Alaska) adopted Medicaid expansion in 2015.1 Individuals
with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL)
became eligible for public health insurance in states that
expanded Medicaid, which substantially increased the number
of adults with health insurance coverage.2, 3 Medicaid expan-
sion also improved other access-to-care measures and reduced
cost-related barriers to care.4, 5
While there is clear evidence that Medicaid expansion has
increased coverage and access to care, findings with respect to
changes in actual health outcomes have been more limited and
mixed. A recent analysis of data from Texas, Kentucky, and
Arkansas,6 as well as an analysis from a national survey,7
found a positive association between the ACA’s Medicaid
expansion and self-reported general health. Conversely, anal-
yses using other nationally representative data sets have not
found a significant association between Medicaid expansion
and self-reported health outcomes.4, 5
Analyses of the impact of Medicaid expansion on health
outcomes have three important limitations that may contribute
to the mixed findings to date. First, although self-reported
general health is a valid predictor of functional decline,8 health
care utilization,9 and mortality,10, 11 it is somewhat limited in
that it does not capture differences between mental and phys-
ical health. This is a key distinction, because Medicaid may
have a larger impact on mental health. Quasi-experimental12
and experimental13 analyses of Medicaid expansions prior to
the ACA found significant reductions in psychological dis-
tress, depression, and mental health-related quality of life, and
little or no association with physical health outcomes.
Second, most studies of the ACA’s Medicaid expansion
include all non-elderly adults, parents, and childless adults

 with income below 138% FPL.4, 5 Low-income parents
in expansion and non-expansion states were eligible for Med-
icaid to varying degrees prior to implementation of the ACA,
whereas childless adults had no coverage in the majority of
states.14 Recent work has shown that the largest gains in health
insurance coverage through the ACA were among childless
adults because of their low levels of pre-ACA coverage.2 The
inclusion of parents in analyses of the ACA can attenuate the
effect size, because many parents were already receiving the
Btreatment^ (i.e., Medicaid) prior to the ACA Medicaid
expansion.
Finally, individuals with chronic conditions are most likely
to benefit from insurance expansion because they require
ongoing treatment and management and are more sensitive
to high levels of cost-sharing.15, 16 Stratifying analyses by
chronic condition status can focus on meaningful health im-
provements among the population most likely to benefit.
Moreover, chronic conditions are more prevalent among child-
less adults than other adults who gained coverage through the
Affordable Care Act.17
To address these factors, we utilized a nationally represen-
tative data set containing validated measures of both self-
reported mental and physical health to assess the relationship
between Medicaid expansion and health outcomes among
low-income childless adults with and without chronic condi-
tions. We also considered trends in several access-to-care
measures.
METHODS
Data Source and Study Population
We used data from the 2011–2015 Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System (BRFSS), a nationally representative
cross-sectional telephone survey of US adults aged 18 and
older. The BRFSS is conducted by state health departments in
partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC) and aims to provide state-level data on health-
related risk behaviors and chronic health conditions. Our
sample provided 3 years of data prior to implementation of
Medicaid expansion and 2 years of follow-up data for most
expansion states. The CDC advises against comparing data
prior to 2011 with data from 2011 and later because of sam-
pling changes in 2011.18 Cellular respondents were added to
the survey in 2011 to improve the representativeness of the
sample.19 Adults were randomly selected for interview from
households with a landline, and adults with a cellular tele-
phone were randomly selected from a commercially available
national database of cellular telephone numbers. BRFSS re-
sponse rates during our study period were comparable to, and
generally higher than, those of other national telephone sur-
veys (landline response rate: 48–53%; cellular response rate:
28–47%).18
For our analyses, we used BRFSS core questions, which are
consistent across states and years. To accommodate our
analytical strategy, our study sample consisted of childless
adults (herein referred to as adults) age 18–64 with household
incomes below 138% FPL, targeting individuals who
would qualify for Medicaid coverage if their state chose to
expand Medicaid eligibility. Because income in BRFSS is
only available in categories (i.e., less than $10,000, $10,000
to less than $15,000, etc.), we divided the midpoint of an
individual’s income category by the FPL in the corresponding
interview year to calculate income as a percentage of the FPL.7
We accounted for an individual’s household size in our calcu-
lation. Our analyses included all 29 states, plus the District of
Columbia, that expanded Medicaid in 2014 or 2015 and the 21
states that had not expanded as of December 31, 2015.
We examined trends among adults with one or more chronic
conditions and those with no chronic conditions. We identified
chronic conditions based on methods used by the CDC to
track chronic disease prevalence20 and that have been used
to examine the impact of the ACA on health coverage among
individuals with chronic conditions.16 An individual was de-
termined to have a chronic condition if they reported ever
being told by a health care provider that they had coronary
heart disease (heart attack, angina, or coronary heart disease),
stroke, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chron-
ic kidney disease, cancer excluding skin cancer, arthritis, or
diabetes (not including gestational diabetes or prediabetes).
BRFSS respondents were asked about hypertension only in
odd years. Therefore, we did not include hypertension in our
list of chronic conditions.
Outcome Measures
Our primary health-related outcomes included self-reported
general health, days in poor health in the past month, days
limited by poor health in the past month, days in poor physical
health in the past month, and days in poor mental health in the
past month. These validated questions are associated with
inpatient and outpatient health care utilization, as well as
mortality.21, 22 Self-reported general health was based on
whether an individual reported poor, fair, good, very good,
or excellent health, and was analyzed as a five-point scale
from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Poor health days (physical
health, mental health, total poor health days, and days limited)
were count variables ranging from 0 to 30. Poor mental health
and physical health days were summed to a maximum of 30 to
provide total poor health days.23
We also measured changes in disability. The CDC defines
an individual as disabled if they responded BYes^ to either or
both questions from the BRFSS two-question disability scale
(BAre you limited in any way in any activities because of
physical, mental, or emotional problems?^ and BDo you now
have any health problem that requires you to use special
equipment, such as a cane, a wheelchair, a special bed, or a
special telephone?^).24
We measured self-reported depression because Medicaid
has previously been associated with changes in mental
377

 health.12, 13 Depression was determined by response to the
question BHas a doctor or other healthcare provider ever told
you that you have a depressive disorder, including depression,
major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression?^
Our access-related outcome measures included any current
health insurance coverage, any time in the past 12 months
when they did not see a doctor due to cost, any routine check-
up in the last year, and having a Bpersonal doctor or health care
provider.^
Statistical Analysis
We tabulated baseline demographic characteristics of our
study population, stratified by chronic condition status. Base-
line demographic comparisons included individuals in expan-
sion and non-expansion states prior to January 1, 2014, when
most states implemented their Medicaid expansion programs.
Significance testing was performed with Pearson’s chi-square
test.
Next, we calculated unadjusted differences for each out-
come before and after Medicaid expansion between expansion
and non-expansion states. We used linear regression models to
stratify our analyses by chronic condition status and allowed
for different transition times by state as needed.25
In adjusted difference-in-differences analyses, we used mul-
tivariable linear regression models to estimate the effect of
Medicaid expansion for each of our health-related outcomes
among individuals with and without chronic conditions. In
adjusted models, our key independent variable was the prod-
uct of an interaction between indicators for expansion state
and the post-expansion time period (equal to 1 for participants
in states with Medicaid expansion during the month of their
interview and 0 otherwise).5, 26 The coefficient of this variable
represented the differential change in outcomes (from before
to after Medicaid expansion) between expansion and non-
expansion states. Estimates were adjusted for age,
race/ethnicity, sex, education, marital status, and state-year
unemployment rate, as well as state-level and quarter-year
fixed effects. The underlying time trend, as well as all time-
invariant differences between states, are accounted for by
fixed effects. We estimated robust standard errors clustered
at the state level to account for serial autocorrelation.6, 27, 28
Additional information regarding model specification can be
found in the online Appendix. We used the same multivariable
linear regression models to determine whether Medicaid ex-
pansion was associated with measures of health care access
among adults with and without chronic conditions.
Difference-in-differences analyses assume that adjusted
trends in the control and experimental groups are similar
before implementation of a given policy (e.g., Medicaid).
Therefore, we examined differences in trends between expan-
sion and non-expansion states in the years prior to implemen-
tation of the ACA (2011–2013).
Medicaid enrollees may be more likely to be diagnosed
with a chronic condition, due to improved health care
access,13, 28 and such changes in the study population could
influence our findings if newly diagnosed individuals tend to
be healthier than previously diagnosed individuals. Therefore,
we used our difference-in-differences framework to determine
whether Medicaid expansion was associated with changes in
diagnosis of a chronic condition.
Finally, we conducted sensitivity analyses using our prima-
ry multivariable linear regression models to examine all out-
comes among elderly adults (65 and older) with and without
chronic conditions. If conditions other than the ACA (which
targeted individuals aged 18–64) were driving changes in
health, we would expect to see similar changes among elderly
adults. We additionally conducted difference-in-difference-in-
differences analyses to determine whether trends among el-
derly individuals with chronic conditions were statistically
significantly different from trends among non-elderly individ-
uals. All analyses utilized survey weights to allow for national
inferences and were conducted using Stata/SE 15.0 (StataCorp
LLC, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Sociodemographic Characteristics
Our sample consisted of 127,248 childless adults surveyed
between 2011 and 2015, with incomes ≤138% of the FPL.
There were 47,942 adults without a chronic condition and
79,306 adults with at least one chronic condition. Adults with
chronic conditions who lived in expansion states were more
likely to be younger than 35, Hispanic, and unmarried, have a
high school education, and have higher state unemployment
than adults with chronic conditions in non-expansion states
(Table 1). Adults without chronic conditions who lived in
expansion states were more likely to be younger than 25 and
Hispanic, have a high school education, and have higher state
unemployment than adults without a chronic condition in non-
expansion states (Table 1).
Health Outcomes
Tables 2 and 3 present the results for health outcomes
among adults without and with chronic conditions, re-
spectively. In both tables, the unadjusted prevalence
estimates generally suggest improvements in Medicaid
expansion states and smaller improvements or declines
in non-expansion states over our study period. The
unadjusted differences in these trends were more often
significant among those with chronic conditions. The
magnitude of unadjusted difference-in-differences esti-
mates was qualitatively larger among adults with chronic
conditions.
After adjusting for confounders, we found that Medicaid
expansion was not associated with significant changes in any
of our measured health outcomes among adults without chron-
ic conditions (Table 2).

 In contrast, among adults with chronic conditions, we found
that Medicaid expansion was associated with a significant
improvement in self-reported health (0.07 [95% CI, 0.01 to
0.14]) and a significant reduction in total days in poor health
(−1.2 days [95% CI, −1.6 to −0.66]) and days limited by poor
health (−0.94 days [95% CI, −1.4 to −0.43]) (Table 3). These
improvements appear to be attributable primarily to a reduc-
tion in poor mental health days (−1.1 [95% CI, −1.6 to
−0.60]). There were no changes in poor physical health days
or disability among adults with chronic conditions. Consistent
with our finding of an association with fewer poor mental
health days, we found that Medicaid expansion was associated
with a significant decrease in self-reported depression among
adults with chronic conditions (−3.4 percentage points [95%
CI, −6.1 to −0.64]).
Health Care Access
We also evaluated several measures of health care ac-
cess. In adjusted analyses, we found that Medicaid ex-
pansion was associated with improvement in all calcu-
lated measures of health care access among adults with-
out a chronic condition (Table 4). Medicaid expansion
among this group was associated with significant chang-
es in coverage, cost-related barriers to care, check-ups in
the last year, and reporting a personal doctor.
For adults with at least one chronic condition, Med-
icaid was also associated with significant improvement
in coverage and cost-related barriers (Table 5). Changes
in having a check-up within the last year or reporting a
personal doctor among adults with chronic conditions
were significant at P < 0.1.
Pre-ACA Time Trends and Sensitivity Analyses
Adjusted linear time trends prior to Medicaid expansion
(2011 to 2013) for most outcomes were similar between
expansion and non-expansion states. There were minor
differences in some access-related pre-ACA time trends,
but coefficients were small relative to the effect of
Medicaid.
Using the difference-in-differences approach developed for
our main outcomes, we found no statistically significant asso-
ciation between Medicaid expansion and diagnosis of a chron-
ic condition; Medicaid expansion was associated with a non-
significant decrease in chronic conditions (−0.89 percentage

 points [95% CI, −2.5 to 0.75]). Notably, chronic condition
prevalence among non-elderly childless adults increased in
both Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states.
In other sensitivity analyses, we found no substantively
similar trends in health outcomes or access-to-care measures
among older Americans with or without chronic conditions. In
our difference-in-difference-in-differences analysis, trends in
mental health outcomes among non-elderly adults with chron-
ic conditions in expansion versus non-expansion states
were significantly different from trends among elderly
adults with chronic conditions in expansion versus non-
expansion states. Additional details can be found in the
Appendix, available online.
DISCUSSION
Among a national sample of low-income childless adults, we
found that Medicaid expansion was associated with a signif-
icant reduction in poor mental health days and self-reported

 depression, but only among adults with at least one chronic
condition. Medicaid expansion was not associated with changes
in poor physical health days among adults with or without
chronic conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first national
study to report positive changes in mental health measures among
adults with chronic conditions following implementation of the
ACA’s Medicaid expansion provision. These timely results are
important to consider in light of continued calls for ACA repeal
by President Trump and Republican legislators.29, 30
Our findings are consistent with studies of state Medicaid
expansions prior to Medicaid expansion under the ACA. The
Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, which randomized low-
income individuals to a Medicaid Blottery,^ found that indi-
viduals who received Medicaid were significantly less likely
to screen positive for depression and were more likely to report
higher mental health-related quality of life.13 Individuals who
received Medicaid through Oregon’s Health Insurance Exper-
iment had similar physical-health-related quality of life as
individuals who did not receive Medicaid. Our results also
provide a plausible mechanism for results from an analysis of
Medicaid expansion in three states between 1997 and 2007,
which indicated that Medicaid expansion was associated with
a 7.6% reduction in mortality rates from Bexternal causes^
(e.g, suicide and substance use).26 This mortality reduction
may be driven by the mental health improvements we found
were associated with Medicaid expansion.
Why might mental health improve among adults in Medic-
aid expansion states? First, we found that Medicaid expansion
was associated with a significant reduction in cost-related
barriers to care. Financial security through insurance coverage
may lead to reduced levels of economic stress and improved
mental health.31, 32 Such financial security could be especially
beneficial for individuals who use the health care system on a
regular basis (i.e., adults with chronic conditions), and may
explain our finding that Medicaid expansion was associated
with improved mental health outcomes only among adults
with chronic conditions. We also found significant improve-
ments in general access-to-care measures. Improvement in
access to care may represent higher rates of mental health
treatment. However, although the ACA has improved health
insurance coverage for individuals with mental illness, it has
had little to no impact on mental health care utilization.33, 34
Several recent studies also used BRFSS to examine
trends in health insurance and health outcomes associat-
ed with the ACA Medicaid expansion.7, 16, 35 One study, by
Courtemanche et al., found no association between Medic-
aid expansion and the health outcomes we examined.35
However, we isolated the population most likely to benefit
from the Medicaid expansion—childless adults with chron-
ic conditions—while others analyzed broader low-income
populations.
Our study has important limitations. First, we were limited
to 2 years of post-ACA data, although we used the most
current data available. Medicaid expansion may have a larger
impact on health once an individual has had coverage for
several years, but our short-term results are critical to
informing current policy debates surrounding Medicaid ex-
pansion. Second, we cannot infer causality from observational
data. Confounding is likely reduced, however, with our use of
a difference-in-differences analytical strategy with state- and
quarter-year-level fixed effects. Finally, our measure of de-
pression was intended to measure self-reported lifetime prev-
alence of depression and was not based on diagnostic criteria.
Nonetheless, we detected changes similar to studies that used
depression measures based on diagnostic criteria.13
CONCLUSIONS
In this national study of low-income childless adults, we found
that Medicaid expansion was associated with significant im-
provements in self-reported mental health outcomes among
adults with chronic conditions. Medicaid among this popula-
tion was also associated with improved insurance coverage,
fewer cost-related barriers, and improved access to care. Anal-
ysis of the ACA’s impact to date provides a benchmark for
policymakers to estimate the effect of repealing the law. If
Medicaid expansion is, in fact, repealed by the current admin-
istration, future research should examine whether improve-
ments in health are reversed among low-income populations
who lose coverage.
