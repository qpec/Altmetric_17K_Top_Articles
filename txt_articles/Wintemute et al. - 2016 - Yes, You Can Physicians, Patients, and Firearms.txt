 Yes, You Can: Physicians, Patients, and Firearms
Garen J. Wintemute, MD, MPH; Marian E. Betz, MD, MPH; and Megan L. Ranney, MD, MPH
Physicians have unique opportunities to help prevent firearm vi-
olence. Concern has developed that federal and state laws or
regulations prohibit physicians from asking or counseling pa-
tients about firearms and disclosing patient information about
firearms to others, even when threats to health and safety may
be involved. This is not the case. In this article, the authors ex-
plain the statutes in question, emphasizing that physicians may
ask about firearms (with rare exceptions), may counsel about fire-
arms as they do about other health matters, and may disclose
information to third parties when necessary. The authors then
review circumstances under which questions about firearms
might be most appropriate if they are not asked routinely. Such
circumstances include instances when the patient provides infor-
mation or exhibits behavior suggesting an acutely increased risk
for violence, whether to himself or others, or when the patient
possesses other individual-level risk factors for violence, such as
alcohol abuse. The article summarizes the literature on current
physician practices in asking and counseling about firearms,
which are done far less commonly than recommended. Barriers
to engaging in those practices, the effectiveness of clinical efforts
to prevent firearm-related injuries, and what patients think about
such efforts and physicians who engage in them are discussed.
Proceeding from the limited available evidence, the authors
make specific recommendations on how physicians might coun-
sel their patients to reduce their risk for firearm-related death or
serious injury. Finally, the authors review the circumstances un-
der which disclosure of patient information about firearms to
third parties is supported by regulations implementing the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

n 2014, a total of 33 599 Americans died of gunshot
wounds (1). Although the risk for firearm-related ho-
micide is highest among young African American men,
most firearm-related deaths are suicides, for which
older white men are at highest risk (2). Public mass
shootings account for a small percentage of firearm-
related deaths but are occurring more frequently and
could affect the character of public life in the United
States (3). In early 2013, more than 40% of Americans
worried that they could fall victim to firearm-related ho-
micide or assault (4).
Physicians seek to prevent important health prob-
lems at the individual and population levels. They in-
quire and counsel—routinely in some cases, selectively
in others—about a wide range of health-related behav-
iors and conditions. In certain circumstances, they dis-
close otherwise confidential information to third parties
to limit the risk an affected person poses to others.
Physicians generally do not do well at firearm-
related injury prevention, however. They ask infre-
quently about firearms and counsel poorly, if at all, al-
though they are aware that the high lethality of firearms
makes prevention efforts particularly important.
In this article, we examine several commonly cited
barriers to practicing preventive medicine for firearm-
related injuries. Some physicians believe that it is
against the law to discuss firearms; we show that this
belief is unfounded. We then discuss the circumstances
in which prevention efforts might be most appropriate.
We briefly review other barriers to their more wide-
spread adoption, patients' opinions about physicians
addressing firearms, and the effectiveness of such pre-
vention practices; more extensive information is avail-
able elsewhere (5, 6). We offer specific recommenda-
tions, based on the limited evidence available, for how
physicians can incorporate firearm-related injury pre-
vention into the care of their patients.
YOU CAN ASK
No federal or state statute prohibits physicians
from asking about firearms when such information is
relevant to the health of the patient or others.
Federal Statute
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(ACA) regulates the collection of firearm information,
but the scope of these provisions is narrow (Table 1).
Most important, the ACA prohibits required collection
of firearm information by “wellness and health promo-
tion” programs. The Obama administration's position
was reflected in a January 2013 White House an-
nouncement that, to “protect the rights of health care
providers to talk to their patients about gun safety,” it
would issue guidance clarifying that the ACA does not
regulate communication between physicians and pa-
tients about firearms (7). The U.S. Department of Labor
repeated this clarification (8); to our knowledge, this
guidance has not been issued.
State Statutes
Florida
The only existing gag law is Florida's medical pri-
vacy act concerning firearms (Table 1), enacted in 2011
after a series of inflammatory incidents occurred during
clinician–patient interactions. In one widely publicized
incident, a pediatrician in Ocala discharged from care 3
children whose mother declined to answer questions
about firearms (9, 10).
Florida's law is seen as intruding on the patient–
physician relationship (11). Its key provisions hold that
health practitioners “should refrain” from asking about
firearms and “may not intentionally enter” firearm infor-

 mation into medical records. There are broad excep-
tions, however. A practitioner who “in good faith be-
lieves that this information is relevant to the patient's
medical care or safety, or the safety of others” may ask
about firearms, and only information that “is not rele-
vant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety
of others” is excluded from medical records (12).
Physicians and medical professional organizations
challenged the law in U.S. District Court, contending
that it unduly restricted their First Amendment rights.
They were successful (9), but that decision was over-
turned by a divided 3-judge panel in the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (10, 13). In February
2016, the full court vacated its panel's decision and
agreed to rehear the case (14). The District Court deci-
sion remains in effect.
Other States
Three states—Montana, Missouri, and Minnesota—
have statutes addressing firearm information acquired
by health practitioners or agencies. None includes a
gag provision. Montana prohibits requiring patients to
provide firearm information as a condition of receiving
health care (15). Missouri prohibits requiring that health
professionals collect or record firearm information, but
with an exception “if such inquiry or documentation is
necessitated or medically indicated by the health care
professional's judgment” (16). Minnesota prohibits col-
lection of firearm information by its state health com-
missioner and MNsure, the agency administering its
health insurance exchange (17, 18).
More restrictive proposals have been considered
elsewhere. In 2015, North Carolina's legislature de-
bated prohibiting the collection of firearm information
in any written form and the disclosure of responses to
firearm-related questions “unless the patient has been
adjudicated incompetent due to mental illness” (19). A
true gag law proposal was introduced in Ohio in June
2015: “A physician shall not ask a patient or prospec-
tive patient . . . [any] question related to the ownership
or possession of a firearm” (20). As of April 2016, no
action had been taken on this bill.
WHEN TO ASK
Firearm information would be directly relevant to
the health of an individual patient and that patient's
close contacts under 3 general conditions (Table 2).
Where physician preference or simple lack of time pre-
cludes routine screening for firearm access, physicians
could identify patients for whom these conditions apply
and proceed selectively.

State Statute: Florida, Medical Privacy Concerning Firearms.
Florida statutes of 2015. Tit. 46, ch. 790, §338.
790.338 Medical privacy concerning firearms; prohibitions; penalties; exceptions.—
(1) A health care practitioner . . . may not intentionally enter any disclosed information concerning firearm ownership into the patient's medical record if
the practitioner knows that such information is not relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others.
(2) A health care practitioner . . . shall respect a patient's right to privacy and should refrain from making a written inquiry or asking questions concerning
the ownership of a firearm or ammunition by the patient or by a family member of the patient, or the presence of a firearm in a private home or other
domicile of the patient or a family member of the patient. Notwithstanding this provision, a health care practitioner or health care facility that in good
faith believes that this information is relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others, may make such a verbal or written inquiry

 The first arises when a patient provides information
or exhibits behavior suggesting an acutely increased
risk for violence, such as explicit or implicit endorse-
ment of suicidal or homicidal intent or ideation. This is
an emergency; the need to determine access to lethal
means for such patients is self-evident.
The second involves patients who possess other
individual-level risk factors for future violence. A history
of violence perpetration is a strong predictor of future
violence in the general population (21) and among fire-
arm owners (22). Similarly, patients hospitalized or
treated in emergency departments for violent victimiza-
tion are at high risk for committing violence (23, 24).
Alcohol abuse is common in the general population
and
among
firearm
owners
(25)
and
is
a
well-
established
risk
factor
for
interpersonal
and
self-
directed firearm violence (26). Drug abuse is another
risk factor, but the magnitude of the risk may be drug-
specific (27).
Serious mental illness is a relatively minor risk fac-
tor for violence to others, and risk depends on the na-
ture of the illness (28, 29). Alcohol and drug abuse,
prior violence, and violent victimization account for
much of the risk popularly ascribed to mental illness
(30, 31). Self-directed violence is very strongly linked to
mental illness, however. Suicide risk is increased by a
factor of at least 10 across a range of psychiatric diag-
noses, and an estimated 47% to 74% of suicides are
directly attributable to mental disorders (30). Violence
risk is particularly high among patients seen for mental
illness in emergency departments, recently discharged
psychiatric inpatients, and persons experiencing a first
psychotic episode (30). Brain disorders associated with
impaired cognition and judgment, such as Alzheimer
disease, are associated with an increased risk for ag-
gression and violence (32).
Third, questions about firearms would be relevant
for patients in demographic groups that are at in-
creased risk for firearm-related injury. Middle-aged and
older white men are at high risk for firearm-related sui-
cide (up to 5 times higher than black men of the same
age), and young African American men are 20 times as
likely as young white men to die of firearm-related ho-
micide (1). Children and adolescents may engage in
risk behaviors with firearms because their judgment
and cognitive skills are not fully developed (33).
Persons
with
risk
factors,
including
substance
abuse disorders, diagnosed mental illness, impulsive
anger, suicidal ideation, and dementia, report access to
firearms at levels similar to those in the general popu-
lation (34–39). Persons with multiple risk factors are a
high-priority group, because risk is likely more than ad-
ditive in such cases (22, 40).
Questions about firearms may be appropriate
when the patient is not a firearm owner, given that risk
for victimization may extend to all household members
if one is at risk for violence and firearms are present.
For example, firearm-related questions would be ap-
propriate if a patient's intimate partner exhibited vio-
lence and abused alcohol.
BARRIERS
High proportions of physicians (66% to 84%) be-
lieve they have the right to counsel patients about fire-
arms (41) and a responsibility to engage in efforts to
prevent firearm-related injuries (42, 43). The American
Academy of Pediatrics has long recommended that
physicians provide counseling (44); since the passage
of the Florida law, many other medical specialty societ-
ies have made similar recommendations (45).
Actual practice is another matter. Screening and
counseling about firearms is uncommon, whether as
anticipatory guidance (46) or a selective intervention
(47–49). For example, in a study of veterans who
screened positive for suicidal thoughts, only 15% of
providers documented whether patients had access to
firearms (50).

 Many barriers exist. Perhaps the most important is
clinician unfamiliarity with the benefits and risks of fire-
arm ownership, with what to say during firearm safety
counseling and how to say it, and with firearms them-
selves (41, 43, 48, 51–53). It is prudent to avoid areas of
practice when one is unfamiliar with the evidence, and
in fairness, too little solid evidence exists. These barri-
ers can be addressed through training (54) and
through development of information about referral re-
sources (55, 56).
Physicians may worry about damaging the patient
relationship (48) by asking questions that seem intru-
sive or invite discord (57). They may feel uncomfortable
asking about firearms, even when they are well-
informed (48, 51), or worry that patients will not be
truthful (48). Some may believe that firearm counseling
is outside their scope of practice (51, 57) or that dis-
cussing firearms could infringe on patients' Second
Amendment rights (43, 58). Fortunately, studies of pa-
tient perspectives on firearm counseling have found
that most—although certainly not all—patients seem to
be open to nonjudgmental education, especially for
members of high-risk groups (48, 57, 59). The Ameri-
can Bar Association has stated that Second Amend-
ment rights are not affected by asking and counseling
about firearms (45). Finally, clinicians may doubt the
effectiveness of firearm counseling, especially given
time limitations and competing clinical priorities (43,
51, 60).
BENEFITS
Research on practices to prevent firearm-related in-
jury is in its infancy; too few studies have been done.
For example, a recent systematic review identified no
studies of the accuracy or predictive value of screening
for firearm access among high-risk patients (5). Such
absence of evidence is common. Except for a few be-
havioral screens endorsed by the U.S. Preventive Ser-
vices Task Force (61), there are few clinically based
studies of valid screening tools for other frequently en-
countered risk behaviors. Nonetheless, the Joint Com-
mission has, for example, mandated screening for
suicide among high-risk inpatient and emergency de-
partment populations (62). Because firearms are the
most common means of violent death in the United
States, the lack of rigorously validated tools should not,
in itself, deter screening.
Many, but not all, studies of clinical interventions to
prevent firearm-related injuries have shown increased
firearm safety behaviors among populations at high risk
for injury. No interventions have resulted in harm (5, 6).
Most studies have assessed interventions in pri-
mary care settings. In one randomized, controlled trial,
a screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment
(SBIRT) intervention involving specially trained pediatri-
cians led to increased safe firearm storage in house-
holds with children (63). Other observational and inter-
vention studies have had positive results, including
decreased firearm access among suicidal teens and
adults (64, 65) and increased safe firearm storage in
households with children (66–69). After brief counsel-
ing by a psychiatrist, for example, almost one third of
suicidal adolescents' families removed a firearm from
the home (68). Because there was no control popula-
tion, we do not know how many families would have
removed a firearm without intervention. Firearm coun-
seling may be less effective when combined with other
interventions or delivered universally (70–72).
Hospital- and emergency department–based inter-
ventions using SBIRT methods or comprehensive case
management have shown promise in reducing the risk
for repeated violence (73, 74). A randomized trial of a
collaborative care program, including brief interven-
tions,
comprehensive
case
management,
and
as-
needed mental health treatment, showed decreased
weapon carrying among adolescents hospitalized after
an injury (75). Many studies have relied on surrogate
outcomes or had shortcomings in design or execution,
such as frequent loss to follow-up. Controlled trials and
a systematic review now in progress (74) will hopefully
clarify the role of these interventions.
HOW TO ASK AND COUNSEL
The provider's attitude is critical (76). Patients are
more open to firearm safety counseling when providers
are not prescriptive but focus on well-being and safety—
especially where children are concerned—and involve
the family in respectful discussions (48, 57). Conversa-
tions should acknowledge local cultural norms (57); be
individualized (48); and, when possible, occur within

 a well-established clinician–patient relationship (57).
Acute care physicians, such as hospitalists and emer-
gency physicians, should intervene when risk is in-
creased or they encounter a teachable moment. We
suggest, “Don't just ask, inform”; emphasize education,
not just information gathering (48, 57).
Giving a context for firearm-related questions can
enhance the interaction. For anticipatory guidance, a
firearm-related question can be included in routine
screening for household hazards or risk behaviors (57).
For selective screening in patients with other risk fac-
tors, we recommend that clinicians briefly explain why
firearms might be relevant to the patient's well-being
and safety.
The first question might simply be, “Are any fire-
arms kept in or around your home?” When the answer
is “yes,” 2 follow-up questions are important: “Do any of
these firearms belong to you personally?” and “Are any
of these firearms stored loaded and not locked away?”
What to do with the answers depends on the cir-
cumstances (Table 2). Questions and advice about safe
storage might make use of the “5 Ls” mnemonic
(Locked, Loaded, Little children, feeling Low, Learned
owner [77, 78]), accompanied by a nonjudgmental ed-
ucational handout (Table 3) and information on firearm
storage devices (Table 4). The desired outcome is that
firearms are stored unloaded and locked, with ammu-
nition stored separately. Safe storage is less common
when other risk factors are present.
For patients at risk for violence, counseling to re-
duce access to lethal means of harm (“lethal means
counseling”) (69, 79) is indicated; mental health, social
service, and substance abuse referrals may be appro-
priate. It may become important for the patient to tem-
porarily relinquish custody of firearms to family mem-
bers, gun shops, or law enforcement, as allowed by
state law. California's new Gun Violence Restraining Or-
der statute allows family members or law enforcement
officers to petition for a court order that firearms be
recovered for safekeeping in such cases (80). Connect-
icut, Indiana, and Texas also allow for mandated firearm
recovery. Other states may soon follow.
The advisability of having firearms at home may
come up for discussion. Clinicians can point to a large
body of evidence establishing that, on balance, fire-
arms in the home (81) and purchasing a handgun (82)
are associated with a substantial and long-lasting in-
creased risk for violent death.

Retaining possession of firearm
Choice of storage method will likely depend on
cost and acceptability
For example, a person who owns a firearm mostly for
self-protection may not be interested in a cable or
trigger lock (which preclude instant use) but may
be open to a rapid-access, PIN-operated bedside
lock box

Uses key or combination; usable on most firearms
Cost: $10–$50
Must install according to directions (not around
trigger); must keep key or combination away from
at-risk persons; can be cut
Trigger lock
Uses key or combination; blocks trigger but does
not prevent loading
Cost: $10–$50
Never use on a loaded gun (could still fire); not
usable on lever-action guns; must keep key or
combination away from at-risk persons
Lock box
Uses key, combination, keypad, or biometrics;
smaller than safe
Cost: $25–$350
Firearm can be stored loaded or unloaded; lock box
could be stolen; in electronic version, batteries
must be replaced; must keep key or combination
away from at-risk persons

 countability Act, lists specific situations in which pro-
tected health information may be disclosed (83). These
include occasions when disclosure “is necessary to pre-
vent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the
health or safety of a person or the public and . . . is to a
person or persons reasonably able to prevent or lessen
the threat, including the target of the threat.”
The Obama administration has emphasized that
disclosure is permissible: “No federal law prevents
health care providers from warning law enforcement
authorities about threats of violence” (7). A letter from
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
added that “a health care provider may disclose patient
information, including information from mental health
records, if necessary, to law enforcement, family mem-
bers of the patient, or any other persons who may rea-
sonably be able to prevent or lessen the risk of harm”
(84).
There is no agreed-on definition of the key term
“imminent”; in research on violence prediction, it de-
scribes time frames ranging from a few days to months
(85). Elsewhere in the Code of Federal Regulations,
an imminent hazard is defined as one that may cause
harm before it can be alleviated by a formal regulatory
action.
There is also no clear guidance on informing pa-
tients of such disclosures. The American College of
Physicians (ACP) Ethics Manual states, “In general, indi-
viduals have the right to full and detailed [information]”
(86). Timing and other specifics will vary because
“upsetting
news
and
information
should
be
pre-
sented . . . in a way that minimizes distress.” Citing the
American Medical Association (AMA) Code of Medical
Ethics (87), ACP's manual adds that decisions not to
inform patients (once referred to as therapeutic privi-
lege) should be rare. However, the AMA Code stresses
that “therapeutic privilege does not refer to withhold-
ing medical information in emergency situations” and
allows for delayed disclosure even in nonemergency
situations (87). As in domestic violence and child abuse
cases, providers should proceed from a right-to-know
position, determining when and whether a patient is
informed on the basis of the provider's assessment of
the patient's cognitive status and “the balance of ben-

the information.
CONCLUSIONS
Medical specialty societies recommend asking and
counseling about firearms during routine patient care
or as an element of risk assessment (45). Neither the
law nor the Second Amendment prohibits such activi-
ties, and the First Amendment may protect them. The
limited evidence on effectiveness is encouraging, and
the need for additional research should not impede ef-
forts to provide patient care consistent with the best
information available (Table 5).
More training and better resource are needed. A
systematic review identified only 4 reports on the de-
velopment and assessment of training for clinicians
(88). Input from clinician and nonclinician firearm own-
ers is important (51). Collaborations with firearm retail-
ers to prevent suicide are being tested in New England,
the Rocky Mountain states, and Washington and may
become important (89).
We recommend that, at a minimum, clinicians de-
termine access to firearms for patients who fall into any
of the risk categories discussed previously. Depending
on the circumstances, interventions may include educa-
tion; counseling in support of behavior change; or
more direct efforts, such as disclosure to others, to pre-
vent death or serious injury.
