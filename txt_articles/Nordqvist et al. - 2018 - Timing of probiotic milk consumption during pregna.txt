Objectives To investigate whether the timing of probiotic 
milk intake before, during early or late pregnancy 
influences associations with preeclampsia and preterm 
delivery.
Design Population based prospective cohort study.
setting Norway, between 1999 and 2008.
Participants 70 149 singleton pregnancies resulting 
in live-born babies from the Norwegian Mother and 
Child Cohort Study (no chronic disease, answered 
questionnaires, no placenta previa/cerclage/serious 
malformation of fetus, first enrolment pregnancy). Only 
nulliparous women (n=37 050) were included in the 
preeclampsia analysis. Both iatrogenic and spontaneous 
preterm delivery (between gestational weeks 22+0 and 
36+6) with spontaneous term controls (between 
gestational weeks 39+0 and 40+6) were included in the 
preterm delivery analysis resulting in 34 458 cases.
Main outcome measures Adjusted OR for preeclampsia 
and preterm delivery according to consumption of probiotic 
milk at three different time periods (before pregnancy, 
during early and late pregnancy).
results Probiotic milk intake in late pregnancy (but not 
before or in early pregnancy) was significantly associated 
with lower preeclampsia risk (adjusted OR: 0.80 (95% CI 
0.68 to 0.94) p-value: 0.007). Probiotic intake during early 
(but not before or during late pregnancy) was significantly 
associated with lower risk of preterm delivery (adjusted 
OR: 0.79 (0.64 to 0.97) p-value: 0.03).
Conclusions In this observational study, we found an 
association between timing of probiotic milk consumption 
during pregnancy and the incidence of the adverse 
pregnancy outcomes preeclampsia and preterm delivery. If 
future randomised controlled trials could establish a causal 
association between probiotics consumption and reduced 
risk of preeclampsia and preterm delivery, recommending 
probiotics would be a promising public health measure to 
reduce these adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Preeclampsia and preterm delivery are two 
major challenges in modern obstetrics. 
Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder 
affecting 2%–8% of all pregnancies.1 Preterm 
delivery, defined by the WHO as birth occur-
ring before 37 weeks of gestation, is the 
leading cause of perinatal mortality and a 
major cause of paediatric morbidity and 
disability.2 The rates of preterm delivery in 
Scandinavia, 5.6% to 6.4%, are among the 
lowest in the world.3 In the United States, 
however, the rate is as high as 9.6%.4 
Maternal inflammatory response is a crucial 
part in the pathophysiology of these condi-
tions.5–16 The pathogenesis of preeclampsia 
involves activation of the coagulation system 
and endothelial cell dysfunction.17 It is 
believed that this endothelial dysfunction 
is part of a wider maternal inflammatory 
response, present in normal pregnancy but 
exaggerated in preeclampsia.5 Increased 
inflammatory response seems to play a greater 
role especially in early-onset6 7 and severe8–10 
preeclampsia. Preterm delivery is clinically 
divided into spontaneous preterm delivery, 
including preterm labour and preterm 
prelabor rupture of membranes, and iatro-
genic preterm delivery. As with preeclampsia, 
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► Large sample size and participants from both 
urban and rural regions, of different ages and 
socioeconomic groups.
 
► Link to the medical birth registry of Norway.
 
► Self-selection bias has been investigated, and no 
bias was found in eight selected exposure-outcome 
associations.
 
► The questionnaires were filled in before delivery, 
avoiding confounding by retrospective responses.
 
► Limitations include self-reported dietary data and 
that unmeasured confounding can not be ruled out.

an increased inflammatory response seems to play a role 
in spontaneous preterm delivery. This is partly explained 
by microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity leading to 
activation of the innate immune system and increased 
production of prostaglandins, leading to intrauterine 
contractility and increased risk of preterm labour. Addi-
tional inflammatory mediators influence the degradation 
of extracellular matrix in the fetal membranes, contrib-
uting to processes leading toward preterm prelabor 
rupture of membranes.11 12 14 16
Modern obstetrics has not yet developed reliable 
methods to prevent or treat either of these conditions. 
Medical intervention in preeclampsia remains limited,18 
although prophylactic aspirin treatment might be of 
importance.19 20 Interventions aimed at predicting and 
preventing spontaneous preterm delivery have also 
yielded limited success, although cervical length measure-
ment and prophylactic progesterone treatment are prom-
ising.21 22
Growing evidence suggests that maternal diet influ-
ences pregnancy outcome, for example dietary pattern 
characterised by high intake of vegetables, fruits, and 
vegetable oils, which is associated with reduced risk of 
preeclampsia and preterm delivery.23–26 Probiotics are 
defined as ‘live microorganisms, which, when admin-
istered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit 
on the host’.27 It has been shown that orally ingested 
probiotics have the potential to colonise the vagina28 
and normalise the bacterial flora in the lower genital 
tract.29 Probiotics may have an anti-inflammatory effect 
on lipopolysaccharide inflammatory response in human 
placental trophoblast cells.30 31 The anti-inflammatory 
effect of orally ingested probiotics has also been shown in 
vivo.32 33 Two previous studies in the Norwegian Mother 
and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) showed associations 
between intake of milk containing probiotics during the 
first half of pregnancy and reduced risk of preeclampsia 
and spontaneous preterm delivery.34 35 Since pregnancy is 
a time of rapid development and differentiation, the aim 
of this study was specifically to investigate whether there 
might be a certain time window before, during early or 
late pregnancy for a probiotic exposure effect on these 
two adverse pregnancy outcomes.
MethODs
Population and study design
MoBa is a prospective population-based pregnancy 
cohort study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of 
Public Health.36 37 Participants were recruited from all 
over Norway in 1999–2008. The women consented to 
participation in 41% of the pregnancies. The cohort now 
includes 1 14 500 children, 95 200 mothers and 75 200 
fathers. This study is based on version 6 of the quality-as-
sured data files released for research in 2011. Informed 
consent was obtained from each MoBa participant on 
recruitment.
The women were asked to answer three questionnaires 
during pregnancy, at gestational week 15 (Questionnaire 
1 (Q1)), 22 (Questionnaire 2 (Q2)) and 30 (Question-
naire 3 (Q3)). Q2 is a food frequency questionnaire 
(FFQ), whereas Q1 and Q3 are more general question-
naires covering health, exposures, lifestyle and other 
background factors. The records of the participating 
women are linked to the Medical Birth Registry of Norway 
(MBRN).38 This study is based on data from MoBa Q1, Q3 
and the MBRN, in contrast to our previous studies where 
the exposure data was from Q2.34 35
In MoBa, 98 725 women gave birth to live singleton 
babies. Of these 91 038 had answered both Q1 and Q3 and 
were eligible for inclusion in the study. After exclusion of 
women with chronic diseases or pregnancy complications 
(rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, chronic 
hypertension, chronic heart disease, diabetes mellitus 
types 1 and 2 and gestational diabetes, immunosuppres-
sion, epilepsy, asthma, placenta previa, cerclage, serious 
malformation), 70 149 pregnancies were included in the 
study. (figure 1) Only a woman’s first enrolled pregnancy 
in MoBa was included.
exposure
Q139 and Q340 contain questions about intake of two 
different milk products containing probiotic lactobacilli, 
in which consumption is defined in terms of ‘cups/glasses 
per day’, specified as 1 mug=2 cups, 0.5 litres=4 cups and 
1.5 litres=12 cups. In Q1, the women were asked to report 
their consumption both prior to becoming pregnant and 
during pregnancy up until the time that the question-
naire was completed (on average around week 17), while 
Q3 (answered around week 30) asked about consumption 
from week 13 and until answering the questionnaire. The 
participant is defined as a probiotic consumer if she has 
written any number larger than zero, with no cut-off. The 
probiotic milk products were product A (Biola, all types, 
manufactured by Tine SA, Oslo.), containing Lactobacillus 
acidophilus (LA-5), Bifidobacterium lactis (Bb12), and Lacto-
bacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG); and product B (Cultura, all 
types, manufactured by Tine SA, Oslo.), containing Lacto-
bacillus acidophilus (LA-5) and Bifidobacterium lactis (Bb12). 
These were the only probiotic food items commonly avail-
able in Norwegian stores at the time of the study. The 
content of probiotic bacteria in these beverages is 108 
probiotic bacteria/mL according to the manufacturer. 
We did not include information regarding the use of 
probiotic supplements, as detailed assessment of dietary 
supplement use in MoBa41 showed that less than 0.5% 
of the women reported use of supplements containing 
probiotic substances. The contribution of probiotics from 
dietary supplements was therefore considered negligible. 
Consumption prior to pregnancy reported in Q1 was 
defined as consumption before pregnancy, consump-
tion reported during pregnancy in Q1 was defined as 
consumption during ‘early pregnancy’, while consump-
tion reported in Q3 was defined as consumption during 
‘late pregnancy’.

Outcome
The main outcomes were preeclampsia and preterm 
delivery in the current pregnancy, as registered in the 
MBRN. MBRN data contain information from the preg-
nancy and birth records and are based on forms filled in 
by doctors or midwives after birth. There are five boxes 
that can be ticked in the form connected to preeclampsia: 
hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count 
(HELLP) syndrome; eclampsia; early onset preeclampsia 
(diagnosed 
before 
34 
weeks); 
mild 
preeclampsia 
and 
severe 
preeclampsia. In this study, preeclampsia was diagnosed if 
any of these boxes were ticked. All pregnant women in 
Norway receive free prenatal care, including blood pres-
sure measurement and urine analysis for protein at each 
visit. According to the Norwegian Society of Obstetrics 
and Gynaecology, the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia 
are systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic 
blood pressure ≥90 mmHg after 20 weeks’ gestation, 
combined with proteinuria ≥0.3 grams per 24 hours 
or total protein/creatinine ratio >0.3 (or ≥+1 on urine 
dipstick on at least two occasions). Severe preeclampsia 
is defined as blood pressure ≥160/110, clinical signs such 
as epigastric pain, headache or other cerebral symptoms, 
rapidly developing oedema, lung oedema, eclampsia, 
proteinuria ≥3 g/24 hours, oliguria <500 mL/24 hours, or 
HELLP.42 Severe preeclampsia in this study includes even 
HELLP, early onset preeclampsia and eclampsia. The 
registered preeclampsia diagnoses in the MBRN have 
recently been validated.43 As in our previous publication, 
only nulliparous women (n=37 050) were included in the 
preeclampsia analysis.35
Preterm delivery was defined as delivery between 
22+0 and 36+6 weeks of gestation and spontaneous 
preterm delivery as delivery after either preterm labour 
or preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM). 
Gestational age was based on second-trimester ultrasound

in 97.9% of the pregnancies and on last menstrual period 
in the remaining. Early (22+0–33+6) and late (34+0–
36+6) spontaneous preterm delivery subgroups were 
analysed separately. As in our previous study, the compar-
ison group in the preterm delivery analysis consisted of 
spontaneous term pregnancies delivered at gestational 
week 39+0–40+6 (35), resulting in a total of 34 458 women 
included in the preterm delivery analysis.
Covariates
The logistic regression models were adjusted for known 
risk factors for preeclampsia and preterm delivery. The 
maternal characteristics and lifestyle variables initially 
examined as potential confounding variables were as 
follows: maternal age, height and educational level; parity; 
history of late miscarriage (after gestational week 12); 
history of preterm delivery (only for multiparous women 
in the preterm delivery analysis); pre-pregnant body mass 
index (BMI); marital status; smoking and alcohol intake 
during current pregnancy; household income; fetal sex; in 
vitro fertilisation (IVF); intake of non-probiotic milk (ie, 
regular milk and sour milk, including kefir and yoghurt); 
and use of dietary supplements as a marker of health-con-
scious behaviour.25 Dietary supplement use was divided 
into three categories: ‘no supplement use’, ‘use of supple-
ments without vitamin D’ and ‘use of supplements with 
vitamin D’, since it has been shown that supplementary 
vitamin D is associated with reduced risk of preeclampsia 
in previous studies.44 Self-reported pre-pregnancy weight 
and height were used to calculate BMI (weight (kg)/
height (m2)). The variables BMI, maternal height, and 
history of late miscarriage were used as continuous vari-
ables. Maternal age at delivery was used as a continuous 
variable, except in table 1, where it was divided into six 
categories (<19 years, 20–24 years, 25–29 years, 30–34 
years, 35–39 years, >40 years). Smoking (categorised yes/
no) was self-reported in Q1 and has been validated with 
plasma cotinine as the reference measure.45 Parity (catego-
rised in 0, 1, 2, and 3+para) was based on combined infor-
mation from the MBRN and MoBa. Self-reported maternal 
educational level was divided into three categories (≤12 
years, 13–16 years, ≥17 years.) Self-reported maternal and 
paternal annual incomes were divided into three cate-
gories (both have income <3 00 000 Norwegian crowns 
(NOK), one of them has income ≥3 00 000 NOK, both 
have income ≥3 00 000 NOK). Fetal sex was adjusted for 
due to findings, reported by Yeganegi et al, of a significant 
sex difference in inflammatory response to probiotics.30 
First-trimester smoking, dietary supplement use, alcohol 
consumption, non-probiotic milk/yoghurt consumption 
and IVF were registered as yes or no. History of preterm 
delivery was categorised into yes, no, and nulliparous. 
Maternal age at delivery, history of preterm delivery, IVF, 
fetal sex and history of late miscarriage (12–24 weeks) were 
based on MBRN information. Maternal intake of non-pro-
biotic milk (ie, regular milk and sour milk, including kefir 
and yoghurt) and alcohol consumption were reported in 
Q1 and Q3. Dietary supplement use was based on Q1.
statistical methods
Intake of probiotic milk in relation to maternal character-
istics was examined using Pearson´s χ2, while mean intake 
of probiotic milk according to maternal characteristics 
was examined using the Kruskal Wallis test. We estimated 
adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for the association between 
intake of probiotic milk (as categorised variables) and 
preeclampsia and preterm delivery using multiple logistic 
regression models with exposure at all three periods and 
covariates in the model. In categorical variables, missing 
data were given a category of their own. In a sensitivity 
analysis, missing values regarding food/beverage frequen-
cies were classified as non consumers. The significance of 
exposure at each period as well as an overall significance 
of the null hypothesis of no impact of intake at any of the 
three periods was analysed. Preeclampsia and preterm 
delivery, including subtypes of both, were examined as 
separate outcome variables. Confounding variables were 
included in the final model if the covariate was associ-
ated with the exposure at P<0.05 (see table 1) or a priori 
(if there was a strong theoretical or clinical reason for 
keeping them in the model). The significance level was 
set at 5% (2 tailed) and all analyses were performed with 
SPSS version 24.
Patient involvement
Patients were not involved in the design and conduct of 
this study.
results
Probiotic milk consumption in the study population
Consumption of probiotic milk in the whole study popu-
lation (n=70 149) before pregnancy was reported by 6502 
(23.3%) of the women, (mean 1.56 cups/day among 
consumers), during early pregnancy by 11 221 (37.6%) 
women, (mean 1.60 cups/day among consumers), 
and during late pregnancy by 12 784 (32.2%) women, 
(mean 1.51 cups/day among consumers). As illustrated 
in figure 2, a substantial part of the study population 
consumed probiotic milk during more than one time 
period.
Intake of probiotic milk according to maternal charac-
teristics is presented in table 1. Intake of probiotic milk 
was more common in women who were older, primipa-
rous, had BMI <25, did not smoke, used dietary supple-
ments, consumed non-probiotic yoghurt, and had higher 
educational levels and family income. Alcohol intake 
during pregnancy was more common among probiotic 
consumers.
Probiotic milk consumption and preeclampsia
Among the 37 050 nulliparous women included in the 
preeclampsia analysis, preeclampsia was diagnosed in 
1851 (5.0%), including 550 cases of severe preeclampsia. 
Intake of probiotic milk during late pregnancy was signifi-
cantly associated with a lower risk of preeclampsia (aOR: 
0.80 (95% CI: 0.64 to 0.94)), while there was no significant

association with pre-pregnancy probiotic milk consump-
tion and consumption during early pregnancy. (table 2)
When the subtypes mild and severe preeclampsia were 
examined separately, a statistically significant association 
was only found for probiotic milk consumption during 
late pregnancy and severe preeclampsia (aOR: 0.68 (0.50 
to 0.92)). (table 2) We found no significant dose response 
effect when consumption was divided into 0 cups/day, 
one cup/day and ≥2 cups/day.
When the two products where analysed in the same 
logistic regression model, no statistical difference could 
be found: Product A: late pregnancy: aOR: 0.80 (0.67 to 
0.97); Product B: late pregnancy: aOR: 0.80 (0.63 to 0.99). 
However, there was a substantial consumption overlap 
between the two products. Probiotic milk products A and B 
were the only probiotic products widely available in Norway 
until 2007, when other probiotic products were introduced 
on the Norwegian market. Sensitivity analyses excluding 
births after 2007 resulted in similar results as for the full 
sample (late pregnancy: aOR: 0.82 (0.68 to 0.98)). Sensi-
tivity analysis, with missing values in variables regarding 
food/beverage frequency recoded as non consumers, 
resulted in similar results as when missing values were 
coded as a separate category: preeclampisa and probiotic 
consumption in late pregnancy: aOR: 0.79 (0.69 to 0.92).
Probiotic consumption and preterm delivery
In the 34 458 women included in the preterm delivery 
analysis, preterm delivery occurred in 2858 cases, of 
which 1795 were spontaneous preterm deliveries and 
1063 were iatrogenic preterm deliveries. There was a 
significant association between consumption of probiotic 
milk during early pregnancy and reduced risk of preterm 
delivery (aOR: 0.79 (0.64 to 0.97)), while there was no 
significant association with pre-pregnancy probiotic milk 
consumption and consumption during late pregnancy 
(table 3). In subgroup analysis for early (gestational 
weeks 22+0–33+6) and late preterm delivery (gestational 
weeks 34+0–36+6), a significant association was found for 
probiotic consumption during early pregnancy and lower 
risk of late preterm delivery (aOR: 0.73 (0.57 to 0.92)) 
(table 3).

When preterm delivery was divided into spontaneous 
and iatrogenic preterm delivery, association was only 
found for probiotic consumption during early pregnancy 
and lower risk of spontaneous preterm delivery (aOR: 
0.74 (0.57 to 0.96)) (table 3). Four hundred and thirty 
of the 1063 cases of iatrogenic preterm delivery had a 
preeclampsia diagnosis. We found similar results as for 
the whole group when the group of spontaneous preterm 
delivery was divided into early and late preterm delivery. 
(see online supplemental table 1)
We found no significant dose response effect when 
consumption was divided into 0 cups/day, one cup/day 
and ≥2 cups/day. No significant difference was found 
between the two products when analysed in the same 
logistic regression model (data not shown), however 
there was a substantial consumption overlap between the 
two products.
Sensitivity analyses excluding births after 2007 resulted 
in similar results as for the full sample (early pregnancy: 
aOR: 0.82 (0.68 to 0.98)). Sensitivity analysis with missing 
values in variables regarding food/beverage frequency 
recoded as non consumers, resulted in similar results as 
when missing values were coded as a separate category: 
preterm delivery and probiotic consumption in early 
pregnancy: aOR: 0.79 (0.66 to 0.93).
DisCussiOn
We investigated the association between timing (before, 
early and late pregnancy) of probiotic milk consump-
tion and the risk of developing preeclampsia or preterm 
delivery. Our results showed that probiotic milk intake 
during late pregnancy (but not before or in early preg-
nancy) was associated with reduced risk of preeclampsia, 
and that intake during early pregnancy (but not before 
or in late pregnancy) was associated with reduced risk of 
preterm delivery. No dose response effect was found. In 
this study we were not able to separate the impact of the 
specific probiotic products. When analysing subgroups,

we found a stronger association between probiotic milk 
intake and reduced risk of spontaneous and late preterm 
delivery.
We were surprised to find a lack of association between 
probiotic intake and iatrogenic preterm delivery, since 
an important reason for selecting pregnancies for induc-
tion in preterm pregnancy is severe preeclampsia and 
intrauterine growth restriction, which can be a cause of 
placental dysfunction in preeclampsia. A substantial part 
(430 (40%)) of cases with iatrogenic preterm delivery had 
in fact a preeclampsia diagnosis. However, looking at the 
number of cases of iatrogenic preterm delivery included 
in the regression (n=919), a lack of power could explain 
the lack of association.
The biological hypothesis behind this work was that 
probiotics might have an effect on the inflammatory 
cascade following a possible infection, leading to preterm 
delivery.13 15 Therefore, we would have expected to 
find a stronger association with early preterm delivery 
since infection is thought to be the major cause in early 
preterm delivery.46 47 The none-significant finding could 
however be due to lack of power since there were only 
498 cases of early preterm delivery. Further, it must be 
recognised that the preterm parturition syndrome has 
different aetiologies and the potential role of probiotic 
bacteria in preventing preterm delivery could therefore 
not be expected to be the same for all cases.13
The two previous MoBa studies indicating a protective 
effect of probiotic milk on preeclampsia and spontaneous 
preterm delivery were based on the FFQ answered in mid 
pregnancy.34 35 As specific environmental factors such as 
infection (eg, congenital rubella syndrome after infection 
during the first trimester48) or medication (eg, specific 
birth defects after thalidomid medication in certain 
pregnancy weeks49) might influence pregnancy outcome 
during a certain time period, with no effect during other 
periods of pregnancy, it was pertinent to follow-up the 
results to investigate a potential importance of timing. 
Investigating whether probiotics have their effect already 
during placentation or later during pregnancy, for 
example after onset of preeclampsia symptoms, might 
also be a helpful guide when investigating the mecha-
nisms behind these adverse outcomes. Previous publica-
tions in the MoBa cohort and other cohorts demonstrate 
that women tend to adopt a more health-conscious diet 
when they become pregnant, that is, reduced intake of 
coffee, alcohol and sweet beverages, and increased intake 
of fruit and vegetables.50–53 The same pattern was seen for 
probiotics consumption, which increased during early 
pregnancy but decreased slightly during late pregnancy, 
but still remained higher than before pregnancy. This 
additionally highlights the need to study consumption at 
different time-points.
There is evidence that a wider maternal inflammatory 
response plays a role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.4 
Steinborn et al showed that preeclampsia and preterm 
delivery are characterised by changes in the composi-
tion of regulatory T cell, decreasing their suppressive 
activity.54 Increased inflammatory response seems to play 
a greater role especially in severe preeclampsia,8–10 which 
might explain our finding of a significant association 
only between probiotic intake and severe preeclampsia. 
These results are also in alignment with our previous 
study.34 Our biological hypothesis included both a local 
probiotics-mediated effect and an effect on the systemic

inflammatory response. In vitro studies have shown that 
probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and LGG) may 
have an anti-inflammatory effect on LPS inflammatory 
response in human placental trophoblast cells.30 31 It 
has been shown that daily prophylactic intake of probi-
otics (0.5×108 Bifidobacterium longum, 0.5×107 Lactobacillus 
bulgaricus, and 0.5×107 Streptococcus thermophilus) could 
reduce the deviated T-helper cell T-helper 1 (Th1)/T-
helper 2 (Th2) response induced by severe traumatic 
brain injury resulting in a lower rate of nosocomial 
infections.55 These results are very interesting since it 
is known that during pregnancy, the mother’s immune 
system changes from Th1-dominated cellular immunity 
to Th2-dominated humoral immunity in order to accept 
the fetal ‘semi-allograft’.56 57 In a randomised, double 
blind, placebo-controlled trial it was shown that maternal 
probiotics supplementation (109 Bifidobacterium lactis 
alone or in combination with 109Lactobacillus rhamnosus 
GG) significantly modulated the expression of toll-like 
receptor (TLR)-related genes both in the placenta and in 
the gut of babies delivered by elective caesarean section at 
term. These findings suggest a link between the maternal 
gut and that of the developing fetus and that microbial 
contact at the feto-placental interface may be considered 
a physiological phenomenon.58 The characterisation of 
the unique microbiome of the placenta, which resembles 
the oral more than the vaginal microbiome, is another 
interesting finding in this regard.59 Further, periodontal 
disease and the oral microbiome have been shown to be 
linked to preterm birth and preeclampsia.60–63
Probiotics have the potential to impact the pathophysio-
logical processes involved in hypertension, inflammation, 
renal function and diabetes.64 Various microorganisms 
have been found to possess such properties, although 
Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are the most common 
probiotic food adjuvants. It has been shown that probi-
otics (1.68×1010 L. rhamnosus CFUs per ml, 3.2×1010 L. 
casei, and 5.2×1010 L. acidophilus) modulate human gene 
expression in the gut lining, acting similarly to drugs that 
target high blood pressure.32 Clinical intervention trials 
have shown a reduction of blood pressure in non-preg-
nant individuals with probiotics intake (two strains of 
Streptococcus thermophilus (CFU 10×107) and two strains of 
Lactobacillus acidophilus (CFU 2×107) in one of the prod-
ucts and one strain of Enterococcus faecium (human species) 
(CFU 6×107) and two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus 
(CFU 1×109) in the other product).65 66 It could thus be 
hypothesised that probiotics might reduce the risk of 
preeclampsia by modulating blood pressure. This might 
explain our finding of a stronger association between 
probiotics consumption and preeclampsia, when probi-
otics are consumed during late pregnancy.
strengths and limitations
The main strength is the large sample size and the link to 
the MBRN. MoBa is a pregnancy cohort with participants 
from both urban and rural regions, of different ages and 
socioeconomic groups and with a wide range of probiotics 
intake frequencies. The participation rate is 40.6%. 
Self-selection bias has been investigated, showing that 
single women under the age of 25 are underrepresented 
in MoBa. However, differences regarding preterm delivery 
incidence were minor and no differences in preeclampsia 
incidence were found. No bias was found in eight selected 
exposure-outcome associations.67 The questionnaires 
were filled in before delivery, avoiding confounding by 
retrospective responses. It is, however, difficult to obtain a 
true picture of dietary intake from a questionnaire. Ques-
tions about food answered in early pregnancy are espe-
cially challenging since many women experience changes 
in appetite. Another strength in the current study is that 
we have information about ‘typical’ consumption both 
before pregnancy and during early and late pregnancy, 
in contrast to a randomised controlled trial setting where 
the consumption is strictly defined by the study protocol. 
Probiotics are freely available and becoming more and 
more common as adjuvants on the food market. As we have 
shown, women continue to consume probiotics during 
pregnancy, emphasising the importance to investigate 
possible pregnancy-effects of the ‘typical’ consumption at 
any timing before or during pregnancy. Furthermore, we 
had access to information about lifestyle, allowing adjust-
ment for potential health-conscious behaviour. However, 
although we adjusted for a number of confounding vari-
ables, including education and income which are the 
most important markers of socioeconomic position in 
Norway,68 69 unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled 
out.
Another strength is that the women reported whether 
their supplement contained vitamin D or not, which 
allowed us to adjust for intake of vitamin D, since studies 
have shown that vitamin D may be related to a lower risk 
for preeclampsia.44 None of the two probiotic milk prod-
ucts contained any added vitamin D during 1999–2008, 
ruling out that associations with the probiotic products 
could in fact be due to vitamin D.
Until 2007, the two Norwegian-produced probiotic milk 
products assessed in the MoBa questionnaires were the 
only probiotic food products commonly available on the 
Norwegian market, which is why we performed a sensi-
tivity analysis excluding births after 2007. This did however 
not change the results. Still, women recruited to the study 
during years 2005–2008 may have consumed probiotic 
products other than the two assessed in these question-
naires. It is possible that some probiotic consumers have 
been classified as non-consumers in case they consumed 
probiotics from other sources. Another source of misclas-
sification is that sour milk was included in”non-probiotic 
milk’. This misclassification of the exposure would most 
likely contribute to attenuation of a potential association 
with the outcomes studied.
Previous studies on probiotics have evaluated the health 
effect of different products containing various probi-
otic strains. Our study setting did not allow to evaluate 
certain strains of probiotics who may have an effect on 
these two adverse pregnancy outcomes, or at which daily

dose and dose regime. The main difference between the 
two probiotic products in this study was the presence of 
LGG. However, due to a substantial consumption overlap, 
we were not able to separate the impact of the specific 
probiotic products in this study. These results should 
however only imply the need for further studies, espe-
cially since there are earlier studies, showing the potential 
anti-inflammatory effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus both in 
vitro and in vivo.30 31 33 70 Yang et al have indeed shown 
promising results where supernatant (bacteriocin) of 
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 attenuated the LPS-induced 
inflammation and preterm birth in the mouse model.70 
In a recent prospective randomised trial in women with 
PPROM, vaginal probiotics (1×108 Lactobacillus rhamnosus 
and L. gasseri) as an adjunct to antibiotic prophylaxis 
were shown to prolong the latency period until delivery 
and improved the perinatal outcome.71 The probiotic 
consumers in our study consumed a mean dose of around 
1.5 cups per day. This is equivalent to a consumption of 
at least 188 mL per day, and a probiotic dose of 1.9×1010 
(Bb12, LA-5 and LGG in product A and Bb12 and LA-5 in 
product B) according to the manufacturer. Strain viability 
during the product shelf life and its survival and phar-
macokinetics in the gastrointestinal tract are important 
aspects that could not be analysed within the limits of our 
study. However, probiotic bacteria in commercial milk 
products have been shown to exhibit a high survival rate 
in the whole gastrointestinal tract.72 73
COnClusiOn
Probiotics might have a protective effect against adverse 
pregnancy outcomes and timing of probiotic intake might 
be relevant. Intake of probiotic milk during late preg-
nancy was associated with decreased risk of preeclampsia, 
and intake during early pregnancy was associated with 
decreased risk of preterm delivery. However, this observa-
tional study cannot establish causality and the pathophysi-
ological effect of probiotics on the maternal inflammatory 
response must be studied in more detail, including 
strain-/species-specific randomised controlled trials. If 
future randomised controlled studies support a protec-
tive effect of probiotics consumption on reduced risk of 
preeclampsia and preterm delivery, recommending probi-
otics consumption would be a promising public health 
measure to prevent these adverse pregnancy outcomes.
