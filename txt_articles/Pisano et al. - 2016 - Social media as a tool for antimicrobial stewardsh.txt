Session: 39. Antibiotic Stewardship

Background.
Antimicrobial stewardship optimizes antimicrobial use in the treat-
ment and prevention of infection. Providing prescribers with the education and tools
(i.e., pathways and order sets) to guide clinical decisions surrounding antimicrobial use
is central to stewardship practices. To increase the visibility and reach of our Antimi-
crobial Stewardship Program (ASP), we used social media platforms, Facebook and
Twitter, to disseminate educational material to Internal Medicine Residents (IMRs)
with the aim to increase antibiotic (Abx) knowledge and the use of our clinical path-
ways (CP).
Methods.
IMRs consented to a pre/post intervention knowledge-based survey
and agreed to follow our ASP on social media. Along with 20 basic Abx/infectious
diseases (ID) questions, this survey assessed IMRs awareness of our ASP initiatives
and social media usage. Over 6 months, IMRs received daily posts/tweets of basic
Abx and ID trivia while promoting use of educational tools and CP on our ASP
website. Engagement was encouraged with daily/monthly incentives (gift cards)
given to IMRs who answered trivia questions. Categorical and continuous variables
were analyzed using the chi2 and t-test to compare pre/post intervention survey
responses.
Results.
In total, 55 IMRs participated in the intervention, 31/55 (56%) have
completed both pre/post surveys thus far. 90% and 34% of our IMRs use Facebook
and Twitter respectively. 41% (n = 23) of IMRs had >1 interaction with our ASP via
social media and 18% (n = 10) had >5 interactions. Mean scores for Abx knowledge
increased significantly from 11.5/20 (58%) vs 14.4/20 (72%), p = 0.01 when pre and
post intervention scores were compared. No difference in post-intervention scores
was seen when IMRs with and without interactions with our ASP on social
media were compared (p = 0.2). The percentage of IMRs knowing how to access
the ASP’s internal website increased from 67% to 74%, p = 0.6. IMRs indicating
they used ASP-sponsored CP as a part of clinical care increased significantly
(33% vs 62%, p = 0.01).
Conclusion.
Social media is a valuable tool for education and outreach to IMRs to
reinforce ASP initiatives while encouraging the use of CP and educational tools to pro-
mote antimicrobial mindfulness and improve patient care.
