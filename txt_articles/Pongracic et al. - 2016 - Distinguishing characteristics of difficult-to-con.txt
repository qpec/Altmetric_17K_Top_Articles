 Methods—Children with asthma aged 6-17 underwent baseline assessment and bimonthly 
guidelines-based management visits over one year. Difficult- versus easy-to-control asthma were 
defined as daily therapy with fluticasone ≥500mcg +/-LABA versus ≤100mcg assigned on at least 
4 visits. Forty-four baseline variables were used to compare the 2 groups using univariate analyses 
and identify the most relevant features of difficult-to-control asthma using a variable selection 
algorithm. Nonlinear seasonal variation in longitudinal measures (symptoms, pulmonary 
physiology and exacerbations) was examined using generalized additive mixed-effects models.
Results—Among 619 recruited participants, 40.9% had difficult-to-control asthma, 37.5% had 
easy-to-control asthma and 21.6% fell into neither group. At baseline, FEV1 bronchodilator 
responsiveness was the most important characteristic distinguishing difficult- from easy-to-control 
asthma. Markers of rhinitis severity and atopy were among the other major discriminating features. 
Over time, difficult-to-control asthma was characterized by high exacerbation rates, particularly in 
spring and fall, greater day and night symptoms, especially in fall and winter, and compromised 
pulmonary physiology despite ongoing high dose controller therapy.
Conclusions—Despite good adherence, difficult-to-control asthma showed little improvement in 
symptoms, exacerbations or pulmonary physiology over the year. Besides pulmonary physiology 
measures, rhinitis severity and atopy were associated with high dose asthma controller therapy 
requirement.
Clinical Implications—Clinical baseline characteristics related to pulmonary physiology, 
rhinitis severity, and atopy prospectively distinguish difficult- from easy-to-control asthma.

Introduction
The concept of asthma as a heterogeneous disease is supported by several observations, 
particularly the variation in clinical parameters such as symptoms, pulmonary function, 
bronchial hyperresponsiveness and treatment responses among patients. In addition, 
heterogeneity of the response to treatment has become of increasing interest and importance 
with the development of new therapies and a movement towards precision medical 
approaches for asthma. The extent to which treatment response heterogeneity and associated 
phenotypes exist in inner-city children with asthma has yet to be defined. In an earlier, 46-
week study in which guidelines-based care was provided in the context of a randomized, 
double-blind design testing the utility of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) to guide 
therapy, inner-city children required a broad range of asthma controller treatment steps 
suggesting that easy and difficult-to-control asthma may, indeed, represent different disease 
phenotypes.1
A considerable problem with studies that attempt to identify asthma phenotypes is that, in 
their majority, patient characterization occurs as a single-time evaluation and does not 
include a measure of phenotype stability over time. Furthermore, it is not clear whether, in 
most of these studies, therapy has been optimized based on guidelines and that adherence to

 treatment has been carefully assessed. The NIAID-funded Inner City Asthma Consortium 
(ICAC) designed this multi-center study with the primary objective to determine distinct 
characteristics that would discriminate difficult- from easy-to-control asthma in inner-city 
children. To achieve this goal, the study sought to enroll and evaluate children with a broad 
range of asthma severity. The design also aimed at addressing the above-identified 
deficiencies: the study involved prospective, multiple-visit evaluations of its participants for 
an entire year during which a standardized algorithm was used to optimize asthma 
management based on NAEPP Guidelines. In addition, given the known relationship 
between rhinitis and asthma,2 this study included careful evaluation of rhinitis and an 
integrated rhinitis treatment plan also based on a standardized algorithm. Finally, substantial 
effort was devoted to participant adherence to both asthma and rhinitis treatments.
Methods
Study design
Asthma Phenotypes in the Inner City (APIC) was a prospective, longitudinal study of 6-17 
year-old children with asthma living in nine urban areas. Participant selection criteria 
included residence in an area with >20% of residents below the poverty level, physician 
diagnosis of asthma, at least 2 episodes of short-acting beta-agonist administration within 
the past 12 months (exclusive of use associated with exercise-induced symptoms), and ≥50% 
adherence to controller medication between the screening and enrollment visits, as described 
below. Exclusion of those participants who did not achieve 50% adherence was done to limit 
the effect of poor adherence, so that response to treatment, rather than variation related to 
lack of treatment, could be studied. The study was approved by each clinical site's 
Institutional Review Board, and written informed consent was obtained from the parent or 
legal guardian of the child. The study design is illustrated in Figure 1.
Study evaluation and management
Participants received a comprehensive assessment at Screening and had their asthma and 
rhinitis managed based on NAEPP Expert Panel Report - 3 (EPR-3)3 and Allergic Rhinitis 
and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) 20084 guidelines-derived treatment algorithms with 
assessment and medication adjustments every 2 months for one year (V0, V1, V2, V3, V4, 
V5 and V6). To standardize evaluation and treatment across sites, clinical data about asthma 
and rhinitis were entered into a computer program that determined the treatment. Clinicians 
could override the computer-generated treatment recommendations if they deemed 
necessary. For asthma management, a predefined EPR-3 based treatment algorithm (Table 
E1 in the Online Repository) was used by the study clinicians to determine each participant's 
controller regimen (Table E2 in the Online Repository) based on asthma symptoms, 
spirometry results, and exacerbation history (Table E3 in the Online Repository). Asthma 
morbidity was assessed and scored using three domains from the Composite Asthma 
Severity Index (CASI).5 These domains were assessed at each study visit and included day 
symptoms and albuterol use in the past two weeks, night symptoms and albuterol use in the 
past 2 weeks and exacerbations in the past 2 months. Detailed scoring information related to 
these domains is shown in Table E4 in the Online Repository. For rhinitis management, an 
ARIA-derived algorithm was used to adjust medications based on reported severity (level of

 bother) and frequency of nasal symptoms, as well as on allergy status (Table E5 in the 
Online Repository). All study participants also received albuterol as rescue therapy and a 
supply of prednisone that could be used for relief of acute symptoms upon consultation with 
a study clinician. All asthma and rhinitis medications (except montelukast) were provided 
free of charge to the study participants.
Adherence to asthma therapy was assessed at each study visit for all participants requiring 
daily controller therapy (i.e. > Step 0). Calculation of used doses was performed after review 
of built-in dose counters at the visit or after receipt of devices in the mail if they were not 
brought to the visit. Percent adherence was determined based upon the number of doses 
taken divided by the number prescribed. A standardized questionnaire about adherence that 
was previously used in other ICAC studies was also administered at each visit. If the 
medications were not returned to the study site, percent adherence was calculated based 
upon questionnaire data. Questionnaire data were used to determine adherence in 
approximately 20% of study visits.
Study assessments
The visit schedule of study assessments used in this analysis is presented in Table E6 in the 
Online Repository. Prick skin testing was performed at Screening (unless results within one 
year from a prior ICAC study were available) for 12 common indoor and outdoor allergens 
(mouse epithelium, dog epithelium [mixed breeds], mite mix standardized [D. farinae and D. 
pteronyssinus mix], cat hair standardized, rat epithelium, American cockroach, German 
cockroach, Alternaria tenuis, Aspergillus fumigatus, ragweed mix [giant/short], Eastern 8 
tree mix, K-O-T grass mix), with juniper and Bermuda grass being additionally tested at 
sites (Dallas and Denver) where those allergens are common. All allergen extracts were 
obtained from Greer Laboratories (Lenoir, North Carolina). Total serum IgE, Phadiatop 
inhalant allergy screen, fx5 food allergy screen, and allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) 
(ImmunoCAP, Phadia, Uppsala Sweden) to a panel of 20 allergens (egg white, milk, peanut, 
German cockroach, American cockroach, D. farinae, D. pteronyssinus, cat dander, dog 
dander, mouse urine proteins, rat urine proteins, Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus fumigatus, 
oak, pecan, birch, maple/box elder, Cladosporium herbarum, giant ragweed, timothy grass) 
were also measured from blood drawn at V0. Allergen sensitization was defined by a wheal 
≥ 3mm larger than the saline control in the presence of a positive histamine control wheal of 
at least 3 mm on prick skin testing (a smaller histamine wheal invalidated skin tests from 
being used in the analysis) or specific IgE ≥ 0.35 kU/L for environmental and food allergens. 
Variables representing a positive skin prick test or positive sIgE were grouped together using 
a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on Pearson correlations.6 Using the result of this 
cluster analysis as a guide, the 20 sIgEs and the 12 skin test allergens were grouped into one 
the following 7 categories: roaches, pets, rodents, trees, foods, molds, and dust mites.
A complete blood count with differential was performed at V0 for blood eosinophil and 
neutrophil counts. The blood sample was also tested for total 25-hydroxyvitamin D.
Using a Jaeger spirometer, spirometry was performed at every management visit, and 
bronchodilator responsiveness was assessed at Screening and V6. Bronchodilator 
responsiveness was defined as percent change in FEV1 as measured before and 15 minutes

 after 4 inhalations of albuterol. Training and supervision of the clinical site technicians was 
performed by pulmonary function specialists from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
Acceptability was based on the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society 
(ATS/ERS) guidelines.7 For children under eight years of age, the ATS Preschool Guidelines 
were used.8
FeNO was measured at V0 and V6 using the NIOX MINO device (Aerocrine, Stockholm 
Sweden). Two maneuvers were performed, and if the results agreed within 5%, they were 
averaged. If they did not agree, a third maneuver was performed, and the two closest results 
were averaged.
The Asthma Control Test or childhood ACT (ACT/cACT) was administered at Screening 
and V6.9-12
As a measure of household stress, perceived stress was assessed by administering the 
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to the child's primary caretaker at V0. The PSS is a 10-item 
scale that measures the degree to which respondents believe their lives were unpredictable, 
uncontrollable, and overwhelming in the preceding month (reliability=0.85).13
Obesity was measured at Screening by Body Mass Index (BMI) z-score based on CDC 
guidelines.14 Environmental tobacco exposure was evaluated at Screening and V6 by the 
reported number of smokers in the home and urinary cotinine, which was measured using 
the NicAlert™test (Nymox Pharmaceutical Corp).
The variables used in the analyses were identified in a literature review that was performed 
during protocol development to identify clinical and mechanistic factors that contribute to 
asthma severity. The study assessments served as a source of variables for analysis, which 
were subsequently grouped into a number of clinical domains as shown in Table E7 in the 
Online Repository.
Outcome definition
We defined the study groups a priori based upon asthma step level controller requirement. 
Difficult-to-control asthma was defined as requiring 500 mcg per day or more of fluticasone 
with/without long-acting beta-agonist, at four or more of the six post-baseline study visits. 
Of note, difficult-to-control asthma was not defined as uncontrolled or poorly controlled 
asthma. Participants requiring ≤ 100 mcg per day of fluticasone, montelukast only, or 
needing no controller medication, at four of the six post-baseline study visits were classified 
as having easy-to-control asthma. Those participants who did not fall into difficult- or easy-
to-control groups were considered ‘indeterminate’. The decision to limit the analyses to 
participants who completed 4, 5 or 6 visits was pre-specified in the protocol to allow us to 
accurately classify difficult, easy and indeterminate participants over a 12 month period. All 
group assignments were made after study completion.
Statistical methods
A consensus process was used to determine 44 variables measured at Screening or V0 that 
were representative of the following domains (also shown in Table E7 in the Online 
Pongracic et al.

 Repository): demographics, family history, personal allergy history, asthma history, rhinitis, 
BMI, Vitamin D, environmental exposures, allergen sensitization, pulmonary physiology 
(FEV1 bronchodilator responsiveness, FEV1% predicted and FEV1/FVC), allergic 
inflammation, and psychological stress. R version 3.2.2 was used for all analyses.
For each study group (difficult-to-control, easy-to-control, indeterminate), generalized 
additive mixed models were used to estimate the longitudinal pattern of treatment step 
throughout the study, as well as seasonal variation in symptoms, exacerbations, and 
pulmonary function.
To compare the 44 identified variables between study groups, analysis of variance and 
Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for continuous variables (normally distributed and non-
normal, respectively) and chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used for categorical 
variables. FEV1 bronchodilator responsiveness, FEV1% predicted and FEV1/FVC were 
analyzed as continuous variables. Although not originally identified in the list of 44 
variables, BMI percentile at Screening, controller treatment step at Screening and rhinitis 
medication score at Screening (categorized) were also compared. No adjustment was made 
to account for multiple comparisons arising from comparisons between groups or multiple 
variables.
Using the 44 identified variables, the Boruta variable selection algorithm was then used to 
determine the most relevant features distinguishing difficult- from easy-to-control asthma.15 
Boruta, which adjusts for multiple comparisons and accounts for collinearity and potential 
interactions between variables, measures the contribution of each variable in accurately 
classifying an outcome by examining the effect of omitting it from the overall model. As a 
result, each variable is classified by the algorithm as confirmed, tentative or rejected with 
regard to its relevance in distinguishing difficult- from easy-to-control asthma. Prior to 
performing this analysis, a single imputation based on a fully conditional specification 
approach was performed on all variables to account for missing data.
Among difficult-to-control participants, a similar analysis was conducted to identify 
characteristics that were relevant to distinguishing participants with controlled asthma at V6 
from participants with uncontrolled asthma. In this analysis, control status was defined as 
having an ACT/cACT score of 20 or higher at the last study visit.
Results
Between August 2011 and September 2013, 1195 children were recruited, 845 were eligible 
for screening, and 717 became part of the longitudinal cohort (Figure 2). Of these, 619 
(86.3%) completed at least 4 of the 6 bimonthly visits for evaluation and management of 
asthma and rhinitis and were included in this analysis. Two hundred fifty-three (40.9%) 
participants met criteria for difficult-to-control asthma, 232 (37.5%) had easy-to-control 
asthma and 134 (21.6%) were indeterminate. Characteristics of the 485 participants in the 
difficult-and easy-to-control groups are presented in Table I. Males comprised 57.7% of the 
study population. Black, non-Hispanic participants represented 64.3% of the participants, 
followed by Hispanic participants (28.3%). The average age at Screening was 10.9 years.

 Characteristics of all 619 participants in the three groups, i.e. including the indeterminate 
group, are presented in Table E8 in the Online Repository. The majority of participants 
classified as indeterminate required variable treatment step levels during the year; only 18 
participants consistently remained on the “intermediate” level of therapy of 200 mcg per day 
of fluticasone for 4 or more visits.
The guidelines-directed asthma treatment step level of the difficult- and easy-to-control 
groups during the one-year follow-up period is shown in Figure 3. The assigned controller 
treatment step of the difficult-to-control group as a whole remained persistently elevated 
during the study, such that the mean controller treatment step was 4.72 (95% CI: (4.59, 
4.85)) at Screening and 5.00 (4.86, 5.13) at V6. In contrast, the assigned controller treatment 
step for the easy-to-control group decreased, such that the mean controller treatment step 
was 1.81 (1.67, 1.94) at Screening and 0.76 (0.62, 0.91) at V6. This indicates that, in the 
context of the guidelines-based management, the easy-to-control group can improve over 
time, as they required gradually lower controller step level therapy while maintaining good 
control. In contrast, an important feature of the difficult-to-control group was the inability to 
taper controller therapy below Step 4 over the year. Of note, adherence to controller therapy 
was comparable between groups, with a median adherence of 78.4% in the difficult-to-
control group, 76.2% in the easy-to-control group and 77.8% in the indeterminate group 
(p=0.26). While the phenotypes of difficult and easy-to-control were stable over time, they 
also appeared to be distinctly evident from the start of the study. Out of the 253 participants 
in the difficult-to-control group, 203 (80.2%) were at Steps 4-6 at Screening. Out of 212 
participants in the easy-to-control group, 153 (65.9%) were at Steps 0-2 at Screening (shown 
in Table 1). The guidelines-directed asthma treatment step level of all 3 groups is presented 
in Figure E1 of the Online Repository.
The seasonal severity and patterns of conventionally assessed clinical parameters (day 
symptoms and albuterol use, night symptoms and albuterol use, FEV1/FVC and frequency of 
asthma exacerbations) are presented in Figure 4. Compared to the easy-to-control group, the 
difficult-to-control group was characterized by relatively high and striking seasonally 
varying levels of asthma symptoms (fall and winter peaks; summer low) and exacerbations 
(fall and spring peaks; summer low). Persistent but variable airflow obstruction was also 
noted in the difficult-to-control group over the course of the study. Indeed, over the study's 
12 months, difficult-to-control participants had more impaired and more variable lung 
function than easy-to-control participants. In the difficult-to-control group, the average 
within-participant mean of FEV1 (% predicted) over 12 months was 88.9 (SD=14.8) while in 
the easy to control group, it was 97.7 (SD=12.7) (p<0.001). Alternatively, the average 
within-participant SD of FEV1 (% predicted) was 9.7 (SD=4.8) in the difficult-to-control 
group and 6.0 (SD=3.0) in the easy-to-control group (p<0.001). Similarly, in the difficult-to-
control group, the average within-participant mean of FEV1/FVC (×100) over 12 months 
was 76.3% (SD=8.6) while in the easy-to-control group, it was 82.1% (SD=6.4) (p<0.001). 
Alternatively, the average within-participant SD was 5.4 (SD=2.7) in the difficult-to-control 
group while in the easy-to-control group, it was 3.1 (SD=1.6) (p<0.001). Notably, the 
clinical pattern of greater asthma severity in the difficult-to-control group occurred despite 
sustained use of highest step levels of guidelines-based asthma controller medication 
management over the course of the year. In contrast, the easy-to-control group demonstrated

 low levels of symptoms and exacerbations, and normal airflow by spirometry, without 
significant seasonal variation in symptoms or pulmonary physiology. While it appears that 
the easy-to-control group also exhibited spring and fall variation in asthma exacerbations, 
the rate of exacerbations was very low, fluctuating from 1-2%. The seasonal clinical data for 
all 3 groups can be found in Figure E2 of the Online Repository.
Univariate comparisons (Table 1) between the difficult- and easy-to-control groups found 
that 22 out of 47 baseline variables differed. Specifically, difficult-to-control participants 
tended to have worse asthma control and lung function than easy-to-control participants, as 
well as higher levels of controller treatment, caretaker perceived stress, atopy, rhinitis 
severity, and inflammatory markers. To account for multiple comparisons, collinearity 
among variables and potential interactions, a variable importance analysis applied to 44 of 
the 47 baseline variables (shown in the left panel of Figure 5) found FEV1 bronchodilator 
responsiveness to be the most relevant variable that distinguished difficult from easy-to-
control asthma. Several additional variables obtained at Screening or V0 were confirmed as 
being relevant in distinguishing difficult from easy-to-control asthma, including ACT/cACT, 
FEV1/FVC, rhinitis medication score, FEV1 (% predicted), rhinitis symptom score, total 
serum IgE, sensitization to mold, BMI z-score, total number of allergen sensitizations and 
blood neutrophil count. Because lung function was one of the determinants of the treatment 
step level, which in turn was the basis for a participant to be categorized into one of three a 
priori defined groups, we repeated the variable importance analysis after removing the 
pulmonary physiology variables. As seen in the right panel of Figure 5, the variables 
identified as relevant in the first analysis remained relevant after removal of pulmonary 
function except for blood neutrophil count. Additionally, age at which asthma was first 
diagnosed and age of asthma symptom onset emerged as relevant distinguishing variables. 
Using an ACT/cACT score at V6 of 20 or higher as a cut-point for well-controlled 
asthma,9,12 univariate analysis of the same 47 variables was performed to determine if there 
were any statistically significant differences at Screening or V0 between controlled and 
uncontrolled asthma sub-groups within the difficult-to-control group. Of the 253 participants 
in the difficult-to-control group, 239 had V6 ACT/cACT data for analysis; 178 (74.5%) had 
controlled asthma and 61 (25.5%) did not. Among 44 of the 47 variables, only the ACT/
cACT at Screening was confirmed as being relevant to distinguishing these two subgroups.
Discussion
This is the first study to date of a large population of children characterized prospectively 
while receiving guideline-based management for asthma and rhinitis. The unique and novel 
aspects of the study are its longitudinal assessment of participants to help characterize and 
establish the stability of the groups over time, inclusion of standardized, guidelines-based 
asthma and rhinitis assessments and computerized management algorithms, and collection of 
variables in a broad range of domains as reflected by the literature at the time of protocol 
development.
Clear clinical parameter differences were found at study entry between inner-city children 
with difficult-to-control asthma versus those with easy-to-control asthma. Of the 44 baseline 
variables that were used to establish variable importance in distinguishing difficult- from

 easy-to-control asthma, FEV1 bronchodilator responsiveness was the most distinguishing 
characteristic. The Asthma Outcomes Workshop Report16 has recommended that assessment 
of bronchodilator responsiveness be used to characterize populations in clinical trials and to 
classify patients into clinically meaningful groups; our work provides important information 
that supports this endorsement. Because bronchodilator responsiveness is strongly related to 
baseline pulmonary function, it was not surprising that FEV1/FVC and FEV1 (% predicted) 
also differentiated these two groups.17-20 A retrospective, cross-sectional study of low-
income, mainly Hispanic children in Los Angeles found that bronchodilator responsiveness 
of at least 10% was significantly related to poor asthma control in controller-naïve 
children.21 Children with this degree of bronchodilator responsiveness, even in the face of 
normal spirometry, had more nocturnal symptoms, increased beta-agonist use and exercise 
limitation while also having a greater number of allergen sensitizations. Given the fact that 
pulmonary function was one of the determinants of our decision-making algorithm for 
increasing or decreasing the level of asthma controller treatment at each visit, which, in turn, 
determined whether a participant would be categorized as difficult or easy-to-control, the 
variable importance analysis was also performed after removing pulmonary physiology 
measures. Except for blood neutrophil count, all of the other parameters remained relevant in 
their ability to distinguish difficult-to-control asthma, with only two new emerging 
characteristics, age at asthma diagnosis and age at which asthma symptoms started.
The observation of the important contribution of rhinitis in the difficult-to-control asthma 
phenotype is noteworthy, highlighting the relevance of the upper airway in the heterogeneity 
of response to asthma therapy. Other studies have identified associations between severe 
asthma and rhinitis in both adults and children,22-24 and some have suggested that treatment 
of allergic rhinitis with intranasal corticosteroids is associated with improved asthma 
control.25 Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that asthma and rhinitis constitute 
manifestations of the same disease in two parts of the respiratory tract2 and reinforce the 
ARIA guidelines that rhinitis management should be incorporated as part of asthma 
management.26,27
Markers of atopy, particularly total serum IgE, mold sensitization and the total number of 
allergen sensitizations also distinguished individuals with difficult-to-control asthma. Like 
rhinitis, atopy was not among the criteria on the basis of which asthma step therapy and 
consequently, group assignment, were determined. Although atopy and rhinitis outcomes 
had already emerged as relevant in the original variable importance analysis that we 
conducted, they remained relevant when pulmonary function was removed (Figure 5). Other 
studies have shown strong inverse associations between total IgE and asthma control28,29 
and our previous work has demonstrated an association between mold sensitization and 
increased asthma morbidity in inner-city children.30 Interestingly, other established inner-
city allergens, including cockroach31 and mouse,32 were not found to be relevant in this 
study. Most likely, this is because their relevance in disease is strongly linked to both 
sensitization and exposure. Allergen exposure outcomes were not included in this analysis 
because they were obtained only from a subgroup of participants.
BMI also emerged as a relevant characteristic distinguishing difficult- from easy-to-control 
groups. This finding is consistent with previous work that showed an association between

 obesity and increased morbidity and worsening pulmonary function in children with 
asthma,33,34 as well as an adverse effect of obesity on corticosteroid responsiveness.35,36
Age at asthma diagnosis and age at which asthma symptoms started both emerged as 
distinguishing factors between difficult and easy-to-control asthma. These factors have not 
been reported to be associated with the heterogeneity of response to asthma treatment.
Finally, our finding of blood neutrophil count as a factor that could differentiate difficult 
from easy-to-control was unexpected and its significance is unclear. This finding was no 
longer relevant when the variable importance analysis was performed without pulmonary 
measures Notably, blood eosinophil count did not prove to be a relevant discriminating 
characteristic.
During the 12-month longitudinal part of the study, the two groups (difficult- and easy-to-
control) exhibited similarities and differences in clinical parameters measured over time. The 
major differences were a) the difficult-to-control group did not show any trend for 
improvement over one year despite guideline-based treatment, whereas the easy-to-control 
group did; b) the difficult-to-control group had higher peaks in exacerbation rates in the 
spring and fall and more daytime and nighttime symptoms in the fall and in winter. Notable 
similarities between the difficult and easy-to-control groups included comparable adherence 
rates to asthma therapy, lowest incidence of exacerbations in the summer and relatively 
constant pulmonary function, albeit at different levels, over the year.
The prospective nature of this study allowed us to partially examine the phenotypic stability 
of inner-city children with asthma. Given that the definition of our study groups included a 
stability criterion (to be within a specific range of therapy step levels in 4/6 study visits), the 
results presented in Figure 3 are not surprising. However, the fact that the easy-to-control 
group showed a progressive decline in medication requirements over the course of the study, 
whereas the difficult-to-control group did not, emphasizes the unique nature of these 
children's asthma. In support of this notion is the lack of any improvement in lung function 
that this group has exhibited, as well as the increased rate of nocturnal symptoms over the 
fall and winter months, which also constitutes a unique characteristic. The concept of 
nocturnal asthma as an indicator of poor asthma control was endorsed in the GINA report37 
and other investigators have previously demonstrated that nocturnal asthma is associated 
with more severe disease and greater bronchodilator responsiveness.29 While the greater 
frequency of symptoms and exacerbations in the difficult-to-control group was expected, the 
disparity of seasonal variability in day and night symptoms and asthma exacerbations 
between the 2 groups was a surprising finding. A large retrospective study of children found 
similar seasonal variability, such that there were fewer symptoms in the summer and more 
symptoms from fall through spring, but did not link this variability with a specific asthma 
phenotype.38
Our study has potential limitations. Adherence measurements may not accurately reflect 
actual use as they were based upon calculation of used doses from returned inhalers and/or a 
standardized questionnaire, which has not been validated. We acknowledge that pulmonary 
function was used in the determination of treatment step level and this could have enhanced

 the relative importance of spirometry in our findings. As a result we performed two 
analyses: when pulmonary physiology measures were removed, rhinitis, atopy and BMI 
continued to be relevant factors and age of asthma diagnosis and age of asthma symptoms 
onset both emerged as new relevant variables. Other factors determining treatment level 
requirements may exist. For the most part, APIC assessed variables that have been 
traditionally studied. The method used to measure stress may lack precision, which could 
potentially affect our findings. The domains of stress and environmental exposure were 
lacking comprehensive measurements that could more fully describe them. For example, we 
addressed caregiver-perceived stress, but not other potential sources of stress, such as 
neighborhood violence. New markers, particularly markers of immune cell, epithelial cell 
and airway smooth muscle cell biology, may be necessary to develop predictors of the 
response to treatment, as well as predictors of achieving asthma control. In a post-hoc 
analysis, conventional baseline outcomes aside from ACT/cACT did not appear to influence 
asthma control among difficult-to-control participants in this study.
In this large, prospective study, we found that heterogeneity of treatment response in 
children with asthma is associated with clinical characteristics that can be identified early in 
the course of treatment. Besides bronchodilator responsiveness, pulmonary physiology, 
rhinitis and atopy were major features that distinguished children requiring high dose asthma 
controller therapy. Assessments for clinicians and researchers to consider at initial 
evaluation are presented in Table 2. Our observations point to the importance of allergen 
sensitization and its sequelae in children with asthma. These findings also put into 
perspective how various domains may link together to describe patient phenotypes as well as 
potential pathways of disease.

1Race is dichotomized (black vs. other) when establishing variable importance in distinguishing difficult- from easy-to-control asthma.
2ACT is categorized as very poorly controlled (≤15), not well controlled (≥16 & ≤19), and well controlled (≥20). cACT is categorized as very poorly controlled (≤12), not well controlled (≥13 & ≤19), and 
well controlled (≥20).

3Not included in list of variables to establish variable importance in distinguishing difficult- from easy-to-control asthma.
4Summarized using the median and inter-quartile range and tested using a Kruskal-Wallis test.
5Sensitization is based on a positive skin prick test and/or positive specific IgE to at least one of the following allergens: Alternaria tenuis (skin prick test) or Alternaria alternata (specific IgE), Aspergillus 
fumigatus (both skin prick test and specific IgE), Cladosporium herbarum (specific IgE only), Dermatophagoides farinae, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, German cockroach, American cockroach, mouse, 
rat, cat, dog, oak, pecan, birch, maple, Eastern 8 tree mix, ragweed mix (giant/short; skin prick test) or short ragweed (specific Ige), timothy grass, Kentucky Blue/June, Orchard and Timothy (K-O-T) grass 
mix, peanut, egg and milk.
6Sensitization is based on a positive prick skin test and/or positive specific IgE to at least one of the following allergens: Alternaria tenuis (skin prick test) or Alternaria alternata (specific IgE), Aspergillus 
fumigatus, and Cladosporium herbarum.
