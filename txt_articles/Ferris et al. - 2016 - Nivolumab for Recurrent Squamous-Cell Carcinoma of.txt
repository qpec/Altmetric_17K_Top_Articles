Abstract
BACKGROUND—Patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and 
neck after platinum chemotherapy have a very poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. 
Nivolumab, an anti–programmed death 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody, was assessed as treatment 
for this condition.
METHODS—In this randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial, we assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, 361 
patients with recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck whose disease had 
progressed within 6 months after platinum-based chemotherapy to receive nivolumab (at a dose of 
3 mg per kilogram of body weight) every 2 weeks or standard, single-agent systemic therapy 
(methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab). The primary end point was overall survival. Additional 
end points included progression-free survival, rate of objective response, safety, and patient-
reported quality of life.
RESULTS—The median overall survival was 7.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5 to 
9.1) in the nivolumab group versus 5.1 months (95% CI, 4.0 to 6.0) in the group that received 
standard therapy. Overall survival was significantly longer with nivolumab than with standard 
therapy (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 97.73% CI, 0.51 to 0.96; P = 0.01), and the estimates of the 
1-year survival rate were approximately 19 percentage points higher with nivolumab than with 
standard therapy (36.0% vs. 16.6%). The median progression-free survival was 2.0 months (95% 
CI, 1.9 to 2.1) with nivolumab versus 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 3.1) with standard therapy 
(hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.13; P = 0.32). The rate of 
progression-free survival at 6 months was 19.7% with nivolumab versus 9.9% with standard 
therapy. The response rate was 13.3% in the nivolumab group versus 5.8% in the standard-therapy 
group. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 13.1% of the patients in the 
nivolumab group versus 35.1% of those in the standard-therapy group. Physical, role, and social 
functioning was stable in the nivolumab group, whereas it was meaningfully worse in the 
standard-therapy group.

 CONCLUSIONS—Among patients with platinum-refractory, recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma 
of the head and neck, treatment with nivolumab resulted in longer overall survival than treatment 
with standard, single-agent therapy. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb; CheckMate 141 
ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02105636.)
Squamous-Cell Carcinoma of the Head and neck is a major cause of cancer-associated 
illness and death, with more than 600,000 cases diagnosed annually worldwide.1 Most 
patients present with locoregionally advanced disease, and more than 50% have recurrence 
within 3 years.2–4 Patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck who have 
cancer progression within 6 months after platinum-based chemotherapy administered in the 
context of primary or recurrent disease have a median survival of 6 months or less.5 No 
therapeutic options prolong survival among these patients.5,6
The recurrence and metastasis of squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck are 
facilitated by immune evasion,7 which is mediated in part by expression of the programmed 
death ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) of the T-cell–suppressive immune-checkpoint receptor 
programmed death 1 (PD-1).8–11 Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 anti–PD-1 monoclonal 
antibody, has shown antitumor efficacy in multiple tumor types.12,13 We designed a 
randomized trial to investigate whether overall survival would be longer with nivolumab 
therapy than with standard therapy, among patients with platinum-refractory squamous-cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck.
METHODS
PATIENTS
Eligible patients had histologically confirmed, recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck (including metastatic disease) of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx that was 
not amenable to curative treatment; tumor progression or recurrence within 6 months after 
the last dose of platinum-containing chemotherapy administered as adjuvant therapy or in 
the context of primary or recurrent disease; an age of at least 18 years; an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status score of 0 or 1 (on a scale from 0 to 5, 
with higher numbers indicating greater disability); adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal 
function; and measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST), version 1.1.14 Major exclusion criteria were active brain metastases, autoimmune 
disease, or systemic immunosuppression; known human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis 
B or C virus infection; and previous therapy targeting T-cell costimulating or immune-
checkpoint pathways.
TRIAL DESIGN AND TREATMENTS
Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive intravenous nivolumab (Opdivo, 
Bristol-Myers Squibb) or a standard, single-agent therapy of the investigator’s choice, with 
stratification according to receipt of previous cetuximab therapy (yes or no). Nivolumab was 
administered at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks. Standard therapy 
consisted of weekly intravenous administration of methotrexate at a dose of 40 to 60 mg per 
square meter of body-surface area, docetaxel at a dose of 30 to 40 mg per square meter, or

 cetuximab at a dose of 250 mg per square meter after a loading dose of 400 mg per square 
meter.
END POINTS AND ASSESSMENTS
The primary end point was overall survival, which was defined as the time from 
randomization to the date of death from any cause. Secondary end points were progression-
free survival (time from randomization to the date of disease progression or death) and the 
rate of objective response according to RECIST, version 1.1. Additional pre-specified end 
points included the time to response; associations between PD-L1 level and human 
papillomavirus (HPV) status and overall survival, progression-free survival, and response 
rate; safety; and quality-of-life assessments.
Tumor response was assessed by investigators according to RECIST, version 1.1, every 6 
weeks beginning at week 9. Patients were treated until an unacceptable level of drug-related 
toxic effects occurred or until disease progression. However, nivolumab treatment could be 
continued beyond disease progression, as assessed clinically or radiographically, if the 
investigator assessed that it was providing clinical benefit. Patients were followed for overall 
survival every 3 months until death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent.
At each treatment visit and for 100 days after receipt of the last dose, acute toxic effects 
were evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 
4.0. Adverse events with potential immunologic causes were classified as select adverse 
events. The criteria for a dose delay or the discontinuation of nivolumab or standard therapy 
because of treatment-related adverse events were specified in the protocol, available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org. Dose modifications were not permitted for nivolumab 
but were specified for methotrexate, docetaxel, and cetuximab on the basis of the type and 
grade of the toxic effect.
Patient-reported outcomes, including symptoms and health-related quality of life, were 
exploratory end points and were evaluated with the use of the European Organization for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire–Core 30 module 
(QLQ-C30) and the head-and-neck–specific module (QLQ-H&N35). Scores for these 
modules range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better functioning or well-being 
or higher symptom burden, although scales measuring symptom burden were reverse-scored 
to facilitate presentation. The proportion of patients reporting health problems was assessed 
with the use of the three-level version of the European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions 
(EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire. Patients also completed the EQ-5D-3L visual-analogue scale, for 
which scores range from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicate better perceived health status.
BIOMARKER ANALYSIS
Fresh or archived pretreatment tumor specimens were obtained after the last therapy and 
before trial entry from 90.6% of the patients. For patients with oropharyngeal cancer, tumor 
HPV status, assessed by means of p16 immunohistochemical testing, was required to be 
documented by local or central analysis and was defined as positive if diffuse staining was 
present in at least 70% of the tumor cells.15 Immunochemical testing for p16 was not 
performed for nonoropharyngeal cancers because of the low prevalence of HPV-positive

 tumors and poor specificity for HPV status at these anatomical sites.16 Tumor PD-L1 
membrane expression was evaluated centrally by means of immunohistochemical testing 
(Dako North America) with the use of a rabbit antihuman PD-L1 antibody (clone 28–8, 
Epitomics) and was scored at prespecified expression levels, including levels of 1% or more, 
5% or more, and 10% or more in a minimum of 100 tumor cells that could be evaluated.17
TRIAL OVERSIGHT
This trial was registered with the National Cancer Institute and was approved by the 
institutional review board at each participating institution. Written informed consent was 
obtained from all the patients before enrollment. The trial was designed by the academic 
authors in collaboration with the sponsor (Bristol-Myers Squibb). The first and last authors 
attest to the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses and vouch for adherence of 
the trial to the protocol. Medical-writing support, funded by the sponsor, was provided by 
inScience Communications and Chrysalis Medical Communications.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We calculated the required number of events assuming one planned interim analysis of 
overall survival after 70% of the events occurred and stopping boundaries that were based on 
an O’Brien–Fleming alpha-spending function.18 We calculated that a sample of 360 patients 
and a total of 278 deaths would be required to ensure that a two-sided test procedure with 
one interim analysis, a 2:1 ratio for randomization, and an experiment-wide false positive 
rate of 5% would provide the trial with 90% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.667 for the 
comparison of nivolumab with standard therapy.
Analyses of baseline characteristics and efficacy followed the intention-to-treat principle. 
Analyses of dosing and safety were restricted to patients who received at least one dose of 
therapy. The distributions of overall survival and progression-free survival were estimated by 
the Kaplan–Meier method and compared by means of log-rank tests stratified according to 
previous receipt of cetuximab (yes or no). Cox proportional-hazards models (stratified 
according to status with respect to previous receipt of cetuximab) were used to estimate 
hazard ratios and compute confidence intervals. A generalization of the Brookmeyer and 
Crowley method was used to compute confidence intervals for the median survival times, 
and the Borgan and Liestøl method was used to compute confidence intervals for survival at 
specific time points.19
A confidence interval of 97.73% was used for the hazard ratio for death in the analysis of 
overall survival to reflect the significance level for the interim comparison of overall 
survival. All other confidence intervals were calculated at the 95% level. The stratum-
adjusted Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel method was used to compute the odds ratio and the 
associated confidence interval for tumor response. The protocol specified that if nivolumab 
was shown to be superior to standard therapy with respect to overall survival, then 
progression-free survival and response rate would each be tested, hierarchically at an alpha 
level of 5%, to ensure a false positive rate of no more than 5% for testing all three end 
points.

 Prespecified analyses were performed to assess the consistency of treatment effect on the 
end points in a range of baseline subgroups, including subgroups defined according to PD-
L1 expression status and p16 status. A post hoc analysis of treatment effect in PD-L1 
expression subgroups (≥1% vs. <1%) according to p16 status (positive vs. negative) was also 
performed. In addition, tests for interactions between treatment and PD-L1 expression level 
(prespecified) and between treatment and p16 status (post hoc) were performed. All these 
analyses were exploratory and descriptive: no adjustments for multiple comparisons were 
made, nor was the trial powered to detect interactions.
For patient-reported outcomes, a clinically meaningful change in score was regarded as 10 
points for the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-H&N35 and as 7 points for the visual-analogue 
scale of the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire.20–22 Analysis of covariance was used to compare the 
mean score changes between groups, with a separate analysis being performed for each 
patient-reported outcome. Each analysis was adjusted for treatment, visit, status with respect 
to previous cetuximab use, and the baseline value of the patient-reported outcome.
The data cutoff point for the analyses of overall survival, progression-free survival, and 
safety was December 18, 2015, which was the date of the planned interim analysis. Data on 
rate of response were based on a database lock on May 5, 2016. At the interim analysis, the 
independent data monitoring committee confirmed that the P value for the comparison of 
overall survival was below the formal statistical boundary for significance of 0.0227.
RESULTS
PATIENTS AND TREATMENT
From June 2014 through August 2015, we randomly assigned 240 patients to receive 
nivolumab and 121 to receive standard therapy (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available at NEJM.org). Previous treatment included radiotherapy in 91.4% of the patients 
and two or more lines of systemic therapy in 54.5%. The treatment groups were balanced 
with respect to most demographic and clinical characteristics (Table 1), although the 
standard-therapy group included higher percentages of patients 65 years of age or older and 
of patients who had never smoked. Tumor p16 status was reported, per protocol, for 178 
patients (113 patients in the nivolumab group and 65 in the standard-therapy group), and 
26.2% of the patients in the nivolumab group and 24.0% in the standard-therapy group had 
positive p16 status.
Of 361 patients who underwent randomization, 347 (96.1%) received one or more doses of 
assigned therapy (236 patients in the nivolumab group and 111 in the standard-therapy 
group). Standard therapies that were administered included methotrexate (in 46 patients), 
docetaxel (in 52), and cetuximab (in 13). The median duration of treatment was 1.9 months 
in each group. Data on dose delays and reductions according to treatment group are provided 
in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. At the time of analysis, 41 of 236 patients 
(17.4%) were still receiving nivolumab and 3 of 111 (2.7%) were still receiving standard 
therapy.

 EFFICACY
Among 361 patients who underwent randomization, 133 deaths (55.4% of patients) occurred 
in the nivolumab group and 85 deaths (70.2% of patients) occurred in the standard-therapy 
group. The median duration of follow-up for overall survival was 5.1 months (range, 0 to 
16.8).
The median overall survival was 7.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5 to 9.1) in the 
nivolumab group versus 5.1 months (95% CI, 4.0 to 6.0) in the standard-therapy group. 
Overall survival was significantly longer with nivolumab than with standard therapy, and 
nivolumab-treated patients had a risk of death that was 30% lower than the risk among 
patients assigned to standard therapy (hazard ratio, 0.70; 97.73% CI, 0.51 to 0.96; P = 0.01) 
(Fig. 1A). The delayed separation of the Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival is 
indicative of nonproportionality, and the hazard ratio should be thought of as an average over 
time.23 The estimated rate of overall survival at 1 year among patients treated with 
nivolumab (36.0%; 95% CI, 28.5 to 43.4) was more than double the rate with standard 
therapy (16.6%; 95% CI, 8.6 to 26.8).
Nivolumab was associated with longer median overall survival than all the options for 
standard therapy: methotrexate (median, 4.6 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% CI, 
0.43 to 0.96), docetaxel (median, 5.8 months; hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.28), and 
cetuximab (median, 4.1 months; hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.22 to 1.01). Across 
prespecified demographic and clinical subgroups, the estimate of the hazard ratio for death 
in the analysis of overall survival with nivolumab versus standard therapy was less than 1 
(Fig. 1C, and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
No significant difference between groups was observed with regard to the rate of 
progression-free survival (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.70 
to 1.13; P = 0.32). The crossing of the Kaplan–Meier curves is indicative of 
nonproportionality. The median progression-free survival was 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 
2.1) in the nivolumab group versus 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 3.1) in the standard-therapy 
group (Fig. 1B). However, a late separation in the Kaplan–Meier curves was observed, and 
the estimated rates of progression-free survival at 6 months were 19.7% (95% CI, 14.6 to 
25.4) in the nivolumab group and 9.9% (95% CI, 5.0 to 16.9) in the standard-therapy group.
The response rate among nivolumab-treated patients was 13.3% (95% CI, 9.3 to 18.3), 
including 6 complete responses and 26 partial responses. In the standard-therapy group, the 
response rate was 5.8% (95% CI, 2.4 to 11.6), including 1 complete response and 6 partial 
responses. The median time to response was 2.1 months with nivolumab versus 2.0 months 
with standard therapy. Tumor reductions were more durable with nivolumab, as indicated by 
the tumor-burden plots over time for patients who had either a partial response or a complete 
response (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
PD-L1 EXPRESSION AND P16 STATUS
A prespecified, exploratory analysis was performed to evaluate the consistency of the 
treatment effect in subgroups defined according to tumor PD-L1 expression level (≥1% vs. 
<1%) (Table 2). Tumor PD-L1 expression status could be evaluated in 260 of 361 patients

 (72.0%) (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Among the patients who could be 
evaluated, 57.3% had a PD-L1 expression level of 1% or more.
In the analysis of overall survival in the subgroup of patients with a PD-L1 expression level 
of 1% or more, the hazard ratio for death among patients treated with nivolumab versus 
standard therapy was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.36 to 0.83) (Fig. 2A), whereas in the subgroup of 
patients with a PD-L1 expression level of less than 1%, the hazard ratio was 0.89 (95% CI, 
0.54 to 1.45; P = 0.17 for interaction) (Fig. 2B). The estimates of the hazard ratio for death 
in the analysis of overall survival in the subgroups of patients with PD-L1 expression levels 
of 5% or more and of 10% or more were similar to those among patients with PD-L1 
expression levels of 1% or more (Table 2).
In our post hoc exploratory analysis involving the 178 patients for whom tumor p16 status 
was reported, the median overall survival appeared to be longer with nivolumab than with 
standard therapy regardless of p16 status (Table 2). Among patients with p16-positive 
tumors, the median overall survival was 9.1 months in the nivolumab group versus 4.4 
months in the standard-therapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.99); 
among patients with p16-negative tumors, the median overall survival was 7.5 versus 5.8 
months (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.25; P = 0.55 for interaction) (Figs. S4 and S5 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
We further explored the effect of nivolumab versus standard therapy on overall survival in 
subgroups defined according to both PD-L1 expression (≥1% vs. <1%) and tumor p16 status 
(positive vs. negative) (Table 2). The estimated hazard ratios for death in the analysis of 
overall survival with nivolumab versus standard therapy were less than 1 in all four 
subgroups. Results of the exploratory analysis of the treatment effect on response rates in the 
subgroups defined according to tumor PD-L1 level and p16 status are provided in Table S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix.
SAFETY
The most common treatment-related adverse events are shown in Table 3 (see also Tables 
S4, S5, and S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). The rates of treatment-related adverse 
events of any grade were similar in the two groups, but fewer events of grade 3 or 4 were 
reported in the nivolumab group than in the standard-therapy group (occurring in 13.1% vs. 
35.1% of patients). In the nivolumab group, the most frequent adverse events of any grade 
were fatigue, nausea, rash, decreased appetite, and pruritus. Among the select adverse 
events, gastrointestinal events were less common with nivolumab than with standard therapy 
(occurring in 6.8% vs. 14.4% of the patients; primarily diarrhea), whereas adverse events of 
the skin were more common with nivolumab (in 15.7% vs. 12.6%; primarily rash and 
pruritus), as were adverse events of the endocrine system (in 7.6% vs. 0.9%; primarily 
hypothyroidism). Pneumonitis was observed in 2.1% of the patients treated with nivolumab. 
Two treatment-related deaths were reported in the nivolumab group (pneumonitis and 
hypercalcemia in one patient each), and one patient in the standard-therapy group died from 
a treatment-related lung infection.

 PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES
Patient-reported quality-of-life measures were similar at baseline among patients randomly 
assigned to the nivolumab group and those assigned to the standard-therapy group (Table S7 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Analyses were limited to data collected through week 15 
owing to a low number of responses to the questionnaires in the standard-therapy group after 
that time point (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). Patients in the standard-therapy 
group reported clinically meaningful worsening of physical, role, and social functioning (as 
assessed by means of the QLQ-C30), as well as of pain, sensory problems, and social-
contact problems (as assessed by means of the QLQ-H&N35). Conversely, among patients 
treated with nivolumab, these measures remained nearly stable or showed slight 
improvements. P values showed significant between-group differences at both week 9 and 
week 15 for most comparisons (Fig. 2C). Additional patient-reported outcome data, 
including health problems and evaluations of health as measured by the EQ-5D-3L 
questionnaire, are provided in Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix.
DISCUSSION
Among patients with recurrent squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck who had 
disease progression after platinum-based chemotherapy, treatment with nivolumab resulted 
in significantly longer survival than treatment with standard therapy. Patients who were 
treated with nivolumab had stability in several measures of quality of life, whereas the 
patients who received standard therapy had declines in these measures.
Our exploratory biomarker analysis indicated that patients who were treated with nivolumab 
appeared to have longer overall survival than those treated with standard therapy, regardless 
of tumor PD-L1 expression or p16 status. Although we observed preliminary evidence that 
patients with a tumor PD-L1 expression level of 1% or more or p16-positive tumors (or 
both) may have a greater magnitude of effect from nivolumab therapy than those whose PD-
L1 level was less than 1% or who had p16-negative tumors, the interactions were not 
significant and were not corrected for multiple comparisons. The response data from this 
trial are consistent with those from a previous phase 1b trial of anti–PD-1 therapy.24,25
In conclusion, nivolumab prolonged survival, as compared with standard therapy, among 
patients with platinum-refractory squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Nivolumab 
was associated with fewer toxic effects of grade 3 or 4 than standard therapy (13.1% vs. 
35.1%) and with maintenance of quality of life among patients with a treatment-refractory 
cancer that otherwise has serious adverse effects on quality of life as it leads to death.

 Figure 1. Overall Survival, Progression-free Survival, and Treatment Effect on Overall Survival 
According to Subgroup
Panel A shows the Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival among all the patients who 
underwent randomization and were assigned to receive either nivolumab or standard therapy. 
In the planned interim analysis, the boundary for statistical significance for overall survival 
required the P value to be less than 0.0227. Panel B shows the Kaplan–Meier curves for 
progression-free survival among all the patients who underwent randomization. Symbols 
indicate censored observations. Hazard ratios (and confidence intervals) were computed with 
the use of a stratified Cox proportional-hazards model, and the P values were from a

 stratified log-rank test. Panel C shows a forest plot of unstratified hazard ratios for death in 
the analysis of the treatment effect according to demographic and clinical subgroups at 
baseline. Hazard ratios were not calculated for subgroups that included fewer than 20 
patients across the two groups. Platinum-refractory disease in the context of primary therapy 
refers to cancer progression within 6 months after platinum therapy administered in the 
context of primary or adjuvant therapy (a post hoc derived analysis).

 Figure 2. Overall Survival According to Baseline PD-L1 Status and Quality of Life and Symptom 
Burden
Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival according to tumor programmed death 1 ligand 1 
(PD-L1) expression of 1% or higher and of less than 1% are shown in Panels A and B, 
respectively. Symbols indicate censored observations. Hazard ratios (and 95% confidence 
intervals) were computed with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model. Panel C shows 
the results of multivariable analyses of adjusted mean changes from baseline in patient-
reported outcomes at weeks 9 and 15, stratified according to treatment group, for 129 
patients with questionnaire responses. Least-squares mean estimates were based on analyses

 of covariance of changes in scores from baseline with adjustment for treatment group, visit, 
status with respect to previous cetuximab use, and baseline score. Physical, role, and social 
functioning were assessed by means of the European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire–Core 30 module (QLQ-C30), 
and pain, sensory problems, and social-contact problems were assessed by means of the 
EORTC head-and-neck–specific module (QLQ-H&N35). All scales range from 0 to 100 and 
were scored such that higher values indicated better functioning or lower symptom burden. 
A clinically meaningful score change was regarded as one of 10 points (dashed lines) or 
more.21,22 I bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.
