Maternal inflammation during pregnancy affects placental function and is associated with increased risk of neurodevelopmental disor-
ders in the offspring. The molecular mechanisms linking placental dysfunction to abnormal fetal neurodevelopment remain unclear.
During typical development, serotonin (5-HT) synthesized in the placenta from maternal L-tryptophan (TRP) reaches the fetal brain.
There, 5-HT modulates critical neurodevelopmental processes. We investigated the effects of maternal inflammation triggered in mid-
pregnancy in mice by the immunostimulant polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] on TRP metabolism in the placenta and
its impact on fetal neurodevelopment. We show that a moderate maternal immune challenge upregulates placental TRP conversion
rapidly to 5-HT through successively transient increases in substrate availability and TRP hydroxylase (TPH) enzymatic activity, leading
to accumulation of exogenous 5-HT and blunting of endogenous 5-HT axonal outgrowth specifically within the fetal forebrain. The
pharmacological inhibition of TPH activity blocked these effects. These results establish altered placental TRP conversion to 5-HT as a
new mechanism by which maternal inflammation disrupts 5-HT-dependent neurogenic processes during fetal neurodevelopment.

Introduction
Mechanistic links between maternal inflammation during preg-
nancy and the risk for developmental disorders in the offspring,
including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), cognitive delay,
and schizophrenia, are being investigated intensively (Bonnin
and Levitt, 2011; Stolp et al., 2011). Intrauterine bacterial infec-
tion was shown to be an independent risk factor for early autistic
features (Limperopoulos et al., 2008) and systemic maternal viral

Significance Statement
The mechanisms linking maternal inflammation during pregnancy with increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in the
offspring are poorly understood. In this study, we show that maternal inflammation in midpregnancy results in an upregulation
of tryptophan conversion to serotonin (5-HT) within the placenta. Remarkably, this leads to exposure of the fetal forebrain to
increased concentrations of this biogenic amine and to specific alterations of crucially important 5-HT-dependent neurogenic
processes. More specifically, we found altered serotonergic axon growth resulting from increased 5-HT in the fetal forebrain. The
data provide a new understanding of placental function playing a key role in fetal brain development and how this process is
altered by adverse prenatal events such as maternal inflammation. The results uncover important future directions for under-
standing the early developmental origins of mental disorders.

 infection (e.g., influenza) has been reported as a risk factor for
ASD and schizophrenia in the offspring (Patterson, 2002, 2009).
These associations are observed for both vertically (i.e., from
mother to fetus) and nonvertically transmitted pathogens, sug-
gesting that maternal inflammation resulting from exposure to
these pathogens in and of itself is sufficient to alter fetal neuro-
development. In support of this possibility, elevated concentra-
tions of soluble proinflammatory and chemo-attractive cytokines
in the maternal serum have been linked to neurodevelopmental
disorders in the offspring (Bell and Hallenbeck, 2002). Studies in
rodents have demonstrated that systemic exposure to high doses
of the immunostimulant polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid
[poly(I:C)] induces a strong and sustained elevation in several
proinflammatory cytokines, most notably interleukin-6 (IL-6),
in the maternal serum. This dramatic induction of the maternal
inflammatory pathway alters several neurodevelopmental pro-
cesses and results in abnormal adult behavior in the offspring
(Patterson, 2002, 2009; Wang et al., 2009). Intrauterine inflam-
mation is observed in �20% of all pregnancies and a staggering
85% of very premature births, the latter of which has also been
associated with a number of neurodevelopmental disorders (Elo-
vitz et al., 2011). In addition, epidemiological observations of
recent infectious diseases outbreaks (such as H1N1 influenza or
Zika virus) suggest that pregnant women and their fetuses are
high-risk groups for severe and long-lasting complications
(Omer and Beigi, 2016). This highlights the need to investigate
the causal mechanisms underlying maternal inflammation and
fetal neurodevelopment.
During pregnancy, a fraction of the maternal TRP is converted
to 5-HT through the placental tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH1)
enzymatic pathway, providing an exogenous source of 5-HT to
the fetus. Prenatally, 5-HT modulates key neurodevelopmental
processes, including axonal circuit formation (Gaspar et al., 2003;
Bonnin et al., 2007, 2011; van Kleef et al., 2012; Brummelte et al.,
2016). Another important placental TRP metabolic pathway is
the conversion of TRP to kynurenine (KYN) by the indoleamine
2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1). This pathway protects the developing
fetus from the maternal immune system at the early stages of
pregnancy (Munn et al., 1998; Mellor and Munn, 2001). Al-
though the effects of IDO1 induction on the KYN pathway have
been studied, the effects of maternal inflammation on placental
5-HT synthesis and delivery to the fetus have not. Although mod-
erate induction of the IDO1 and TPH1 pathway during preg-
nancy is important from an immunosuppressive (countering
maternal rejection) standpoint, altered 5-HT output to the fetus
may affect neurodevelopment significantly.
Here, we used a well established prenatal immune challenge in
mice to study the effects of maternal inflammation in midpreg-
nancy on TRP metabolism in the placenta and the downstream
consequences on fetal brain development. Moderate doses of
poly(I:C) were used to induce a mild maternal immune challenge
that was shown previously to induce significant long-term brain
and behavioral deficits in the adult offspring (Meyer et al., 2005;
Meyer and Feldon, 2012). We observed that mild maternal in-
flammation during pregnancy leads to a transient increase of
placental TRP concentration, followed by upregulation of Tph1
gene expression and increased TPH1 enzymatic activity in the
placenta. These changes led to a sustained increase of placental
5-HT output to the fetus and ultimately increased 5-HT tissue
concentration specifically within the fetal forebrain. Simultane-
ously, serotonergic axon outgrowth, a neurogenic process mod-
ulated by 5-HT signaling, was disrupted in this region. The
pharmacological inhibition of TPH1 activity prevented the ef-
fects of maternal inflammation on fetal serotonergic develop-
ment. These findings suggest that fetal brain serotonergic
development is highly sensitive to maternal inflammation
through disruptions of placental TRP metabolism to 5-HT.
Materials and Methods
Animals and maternal immune activation. Pregnant female CD-1 dams
(Charles River Laboratories) were injected intraperitoneally at embry-
onic day 12 (E12; the copulatory plug date is considered E1) with saline
(0.9% sterile solution; BD Biosciences, 297753) or 2 mg/kg poly(I:C)
(Sigma-Aldrich, P9582) using 5 �l/g per pregnant dam. For pharmaco-
logical inhibition of TPH activity experiments, dams were injected intra-
peritoneally at E12 with either saline or poly(I:C) (2 mg/kg) and
para-cholorophenylalanine (pCPA; 300 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich, C6506).
Dams were anesthetized and fetal forebrain, hindbrain, placenta, tail
samples, and serum were harvested as described previously (Bonnin et
al., 2011). SRY genotyping for the purpose of analyzing sex differences
was performed on all fetuses. Fetal tissues from each litter were either
fresh frozen or fixed and randomly assigned to subsequent analyses. All
procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee.
qRT-PCR analysis. For mRNA expression analyses, three fresh-frozen
fetal tissue samples from each dam were pooled and 40 mg of tissue was
extracted for RNA using the Bio-Rad Aurum Total RNA Mini Kit according
to the manufacturer’s specifications. Extracted RNA was quantified and
testedforpurityspectrophotometricallyandRNAqualitywasassessedusing
an Agilent Technologies 2100 bioanalyzer with high sensitivity RNA Screen-
tape. Only samples with an RNA integrity number of 8.5 or higher and a
260/280 ratio of 1.8–2.2 were used for subsequent qRT-PCR analysis. After
quality assessment and quantification, 1 �g of RNA was reverse transcribed
to cDNA using the Invitrogen SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis Super-
Mix for qRT-PCR kit according to the manufacturer’s specifications. qRT-

In vitro 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) synthesis assays. Harvested tis-
sues (placenta, forebrain, and hindbrain) were thawed on ice and ho-
mogenized ultrasonically in, respectively, 400, 100, or 80 �l of extraction
buffer composed of 0.05 M Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM dithio-
threitol and 1 mM EGTA. Homogenates were centrifuged at 21,000 � g
for 15 min at 4°C and then assayed for tryptophan hydroxylase activity.
Briefly, 20 �l of supernatant was added to tubes containing 80 �l of
reaction or control buffer to give a final concentration of: 0.05 M Tris
buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA, 50 �g/ml catalase, 200 �M L-tryptophan, 100
�M ammonium iron (II) sulfate, and 100 �M tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4;

 a cofactor required for TPH1 and TPH2 activity). Control buffers did not
receive TRP or BH4. Tubes were incubated for 30 min at 37°C and
reactions were terminated through protein denaturation by adding 100
�l of 0.2 M percholoric acid with 100 �M EDTA. Samples were stored on
ice for 15 min to allow for complete protein denaturation and then
centrifuged for 15 min at 21,000 � g at 4°C. TRP metabolism was deter-
mined by measuring the 5-HTP concentration using HPLC with electro-
chemical detection (see below). Protein concentration of the supernatants
was determined using a detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad) and
enzymatic activity was quantified as picograms of 5-HTP/�g of protein/30
min. Results are expressed as percentage of activity measured against saline-
injected controls. Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich.
HPLC analysis. The HPLC analysis of perfusion samples and enzy-
matic assay supernatants was performed on an Eicom 700 system con-
sisting of an ECD-700 electrochemical detector, an Eicom 700 Insight
autosampler, and Envision integration software. An Eicompak SC-3ODS
3 �m C18 reversed-phase column (3.0 � 100 mm inner diameter) ana-
lytical column was used for separation. Samples were extracted in a 1:1
volume of 0.2 M perchloric acid with 100 �M EDTA and a volume of 10 �l
was injected into the column. The mobile phase used for separation
consisted of 0.1 M citric acid, 0.2 M sodium phosphate dibasic, 7% meth-
anol (JT Baker, 9093-03), and 5 mg of EDTA in ultrapure water at a flow
rate of 450 �l/min. Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. For measures of biogenic amine concentrations in
fetal tissues, see Herve
´ et al. (1996) and Janusonis et al (2006) for detailed
methodology.
Cytokine analysis. The maternal and placental inflammatory response
to poly(I:C) or saline was quantified in every mouse by measuring the
concentration of an array of cytokines and chemokines in serum or tissue
homogenates at time of harvesting. Tissue concentrations were measured
in the maternal serum, placenta, and fetal brains for the following cyto-
kines/chemokines: CCL2–5, CXCL1, CXCL9, IL-1a/b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6,
IL-10, IL-17, IL-23, IFN�, and TNF�. For serum preparation, whole
blood was collected and allowed to coagulate at 4°C for 30 min before
centrifugation at 2000 � g for 10 min at 4°C. Serum supernatant was
collected and stored at �70°C. Placental and fetal brain tissues were
homogenized immediately upon collection in 3 volumes (microliters per
milligram) of ice-cold PBS supplemented with commercially available
protease inhibitor mixture (Cell Signaling Technology, 5871S). Homog-
enates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 � g for 10 min at 4°C,
and then supernatants were collected and stored at �70°C. For assess-
ment of solute concentrations, we used commercially available cytomet-
ric bead arrays (CBAs) (BD Biosciences) as described previously (Lund et
al., 2004). To assay, all samples were thawed on ice, diluted 1:3 in the
supplied dilution buffer, and then run in triplicate. The concentration of
each solute was calculated based on a standard curve of known concen-
trations and the intra-assay variability accounted for using internal con-
trol samples. The CBA sample data were collected using a BD Biosciences
Accuri cytometer and analyzed using the commercially available FCAP
Array Software (BD Biosciences). The mean sample concentration from
serum is given as picograms per milliliter and that from tissue as pico-
grams per milliliter of tissue homogenate.
Ex vivo placental perfusion 5-HT synthesis assay. For perfusion exper-
iments, a separate cohort of pregnant dams was injected with either saline
(n � 4) or poly(I:C) (n � 4) at E12. Briefly, a single placenta per dam was
harvested at E14 and quickly transferred to a thermostatically controlled
incubation chamber at 37°C. The uterine artery was cannulated with a
200-�m-diameter catheter and perfused at 20 �l/min with DMEM (Life
Technologies, 11054-001) containing 200 �M L-tryptophan and 100 �M
BH4. The umbilical artery was cannulated with a 105-�m-diameter cath-
eter and perfused at 5 �l/min with DMEM. The eluate was collected from
the umbilical vein for 90 min and analyzed for 5-HT concentration with
HPLC. (For detailed methodology, see Goeden and Bonnin, 2013).
Neurodevelopmental assays. Fetal brains were dissected in ice-cold PBS,
immediately transferred to 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and incubated
at 4°C for 24 h. The fetal brains were then incubated in 10%, 20%, and
30% sucrose (dissolved in PBS) for 24 h each at 4°C. After incubation, the
brains were embedded in cryomolds on dry ice using Tissue Tek embed-
ding medium (VWR, 25608-930) and stored at �80°C until sectioning.
Embedded brains were removed from the �80°C freezer the night before
sectioning and allowed to warm to �20°C. Fetal brains were sectioned
coronally with a thickness of 20 �m and sectioned tissue was stored at
�80°C until immunohistochemical analysis. Sections were permeabil-
ized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 2% fetal bovine serum in PBS and incu-
bated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies: rabbit anti-5HT (final
concentration 58 �g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, S5545). After extensive washing
in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, slides were incubated at room tempera-
ture for 2 h with secondary antibody: Rhodamine Red-X-conjugated
donkey anti-rabbit (1:800; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Im-
ages were acquired with a Zeiss AxioCam MRm camera using Zeiss Ax-
ioVision version 4.8.2 software. 5-HT fluorescence intensity distribution
was quantified using ImageJ. In every section, the fluorescence intensity
was normalized to the background.
Statistical analyses. In all experiments, dams were treated as individual
experimental groups (1 dam, n � 1) and fetuses (n � 3–5 of either sex per
dam) as biological repeats. For every measure, the number of dams used
in each group is indicated in the figures. For cytokine analyses, qRT-PCR,
HPLC, and enzymatic activity assays, the statistical significance of differ-
ences between groups was assessed using two-way ANOVA (followed by
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, assuming that signifi-
cant (p � 0.05) main effects were observed), with time points and treat-
ments used as variables. Unless otherwise noted, statistical differences
presented are for treatment effects. For ex vivo placental perfusion exper-
iments and PCPA treatment experiments performed at a single time
point, differences between groups were compared using unpaired t tests
with the Holm–Sidak correction for multiple comparisons. For compar-
isons of 5-HT immunofluorescence distribution along the rostrocaudal
extent of the fetal brain in the saline (control) group versus the poly(I:
C)-treated group at a single time point, the Mann–Whitney U test was
used. No sex differences were observed in any of the analyses. All analyses
were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6 software.
Results
Mild inflammation increases placental TRP metabolism and
5-HT delivery to the fetus
Pregnant dams were injected at E12 with 2 mg/kg poly(I:C) or
saline solution (control) and the maternal, placental, and fetal
inflammatory response was quantified in every mouse at time of
harvesting (i.e., E12 � 24 or 48 h). Of all cytokines tested, only the
IL-6 concentration was significantly different in the maternal se-
rum of poly(I:C)-treated dams compared with saline-injected
controls (overall effect of treatment: p � 0.004, F � 10.86, df �
18) and only at the 24 h time point (increase of 92.3% over
controls, p � 0.0002). Importantly, despite the increased concen-
tration of IL-6 in the maternal serum after poly(I:C) exposure,
there was no change in fetal brain or placenta levels at 24 or 48 h
(Fig. 1A,B). qRT-PCR analysis revealed significant effects of ma-
ternal inflammation on TRP metabolic gene expression in the
placenta (Fig. 1C,D). The most significant changes induced by
poly(I:C) treatment over basal expression measured in controls
obtained from saline-injected dams were observed for Ido1 (ex-
pression increased 4.2-fold and 1.9-fold at the 24 and 48 h time
points, respectively; overall significant effect of treatment: p �
0.0001, F � 707.0, df � 14), followed by Tph1 gene expression
(increased 2.5-fold at 24 h and decreased 2.7-fold at 48 h; overall
significant effect of treatment: p � 0.0001, F � 31.58, df � 14);
there was no effect of poly(I:C) exposure on Maoa gene expres-
sion at either time point (no significant overall effect of treat-
ment: p � 0.0855, F � 3.424, df � 14). There was no significant
effect of treatment on any TRP metabolic gene expression (i.e.,
Maoa, Ido1, or Tph2) in the fetal brain at either time point (data
not shown).
To determine whether altered gene expression ultimately af-
fects the placental conversion of maternal TRP to 5-HT, we mea-

 sured TPH1/2 enzymatic activity directly in placentas and brains
harvested from a subset of the same litters. There was a significant
effect of exposure to poly(I:C) on TPH1 activity in the placenta
(overall significant effect of treatment: p � 0.0316, F � 6.766,
df � 8); TPH1 activity was significantly increased 48 h after treat-
ment (p � 0.009) only. In contrast, TPH2 enzymatic activity was
not significantly altered by poly(I:C) exposure in the fetal hind-
brain either 24 or 48 h after treatment (no significant overall
effect of treatment: p � 0.3728, F � 0.8913, df � 8; Fig. 2A). To
determine whether the increase in placental TPH1 enzymatic ac-
tivity affects placental 5-HT synthesis and delivery to the fetus, we
measured the real-time 5-HT output of ex vivo perfused placentas
from saline- and poly(I:C)-injected dams. We observed a signif-
icantly increased (t(6) � 2.7, p � 2.0E-2) concentration of 5-HT
released into the umbilical vein when comparing placentas from
poly(I:C) exposed dams with placentas from control dams (Fig.
2B). These results demonstrate that a mild maternal inflam-
mation induces a cascade of genetic and enzymatic changes
within the placenta that result in increased 5-HT output to the
fetus after 48 h.
Fetal forebrain 5-HT increases rapidly after mild maternal
immune activation
Consistent with previous findings that placental 5-HT synthesis
affects fetal forebrain 5-HT concentration (Bonnin et al., 2011;
Goeden and Bonnin, 2013), there was overall a significant effect
of poly(I:C) treatment on fetal forebrain 5-HT tissue concentra-
tion (p � 0.0028, F � 14.71, df � 11; Fig. 3A,C); although 5-HT
tissue concentration was elevated at both time points after
poly(I:C) exposure, the increase was significant only 48 h after
treatment (comparison with saline controls: p � 0.1342 at 24 h;
p � 0.0130 at 48 h). The treatment had no significant effect on
hindbrain 5-HT tissue concentration at either time point (p �
0.8094, F � 0.0610, df � 11; Fig. 3B,D). Fetal brain tissue con-
centrations of 5-HIAA, the primary metabolite of 5-HT, re-
mained unchanged at both time points (p � 0.1384, F � 2.553,
df � 11). The concentration of 5-HTP in the fetal forebrain was
below detection levels at these time points (data not shown).
Poly(I:C) treatment also had a significant overall effect on KYN
tissue concentration in the fetal forebrain (p � 0.0022, F � 15.67,
df � 11; Fig. 3A,C) and hindbrain (p � 0.0208, F � 7.263, df �
11; Fig. 3B,D). Importantly, there was an overall effect of
poly(I:C) exposure on placental TRP concentration (p � 0.0058,
F � 11.67, df � 11; Fig. 3E), with a significant increase at 24 h
(1.4-fold over saline-injected controls, p � 0.0006), but not 48 h
(p � 0.9999). To test the possibility that increased substrate
(TRP) availability in the placenta 24 h after poly(I:C) injection
leads to increased metabolic conversion to 5-HT, we performed
dose–response studies in placentas 24 h after poly(I:C) or saline
injections. The in vitro enzymatic activity assays demonstrated
that increasing input concentrations of TRP led to a linear in-
crease of 5-HTP production in both the saline (r 2 � 0.9996) and
poly(I:C) (r 2 � 0.9972) groups. Therefore, placental 5-HT syn-
thesis is correlated linearly to TRP substrate availability (Fig. 3F).

 Decreased 5-HT axon outgrowth in the fetal forebrain
In addition to increased placental output, elevated forebrain
5-HT tissue concentration could have resulted from increased
endogenous serotonergic axon outgrowth into the region. To test
this possibility, we measured serotonergic (5-HT-immuno-
reactive, 5-HT�) axon density systematically throughout the
rostrocaudal extent of the fetal forebrain 48 h after maternal ex-
posure to saline, poly(I:C), or poly(I:C) and the TPH inhibitor
pCPA (Fig. 4A). When comparing sets of sections at matching
rostrocaudal levels, densitometric analysis of fluorescence distri-
bution showed a significant decrease of 5-HT� axon density in
the rostral two-thirds of the forebrain in the poly(I:C)-treated,
but not the poly(I:C) � pCPA-treated group, compared with
saline (Fig. 4B). The overall 5-HT� axon density over the entire
rostrocaudal axis was significantly decreased in the poly(I:C)-
treated group compared with saline, but not after the coadmin-
istration of poly(I:C) with pCPA (Fig. 4B; Mann–Whitney test,
U � 60, p � 0.0009). Furthermore, HPLC analyses showed that
coadministration of pCPA prevents the accumulation of 5-HT in
the fetal forebrain that is induced by poly(I:C) exposure alone
versus the poly(I:C) � pCPA group (t(6) � 4.94, p � 0.002; saline
group versus poly(I:C) � pCPA group: t(6) � 1.81, p � 0.119; Fig.
4C). These results show that the elevation of 5-HT in the fore-
brain after mild inflammation is not due to increased serotoner-
gic axon outgrowth into the region. Rather, the results suggest
that elevated placental output of 5-HT after mild immune acti-
vation leads to increased extracellular 5-HT accumulation in the
fetal forebrain that affect serotonergic axon rostral outgrowth
negatively.
Discussion
Our results identify a novel molecular pathway by which mater-
nal inflammation during pregnancy alters specific aspects of fetal
brain development. We used a mild maternal immune challenge
[2 mg/kg poly(I:C) administered i.p. at E12] with the following
characteristics: (1) it does not lead to the accumulation of cyto-
kines in the fetal brain, (2) it mimics clinically common mild
inflammation with transient cytokine elevations in the maternal
serum (Giovanoli et al., 2013; Meyer, 2014), and (3) it induces
significant long-term brain and behavioral deficits in the adult
offspring (Meyer et al., 2005; Meyer and Feldon, 2012). Impor-
tantly, whereas the mild immune challenge induced the expected
transient IL-6 increase in the maternal serum, there was no evi-
dence of cytokine accumulation in the fetal brain tissue (Fig. 1).
This suggests, not only that mild subclinical maternal inflamma-
tion does not alter overall placental permeability to cytokines, but
also that it primarily involves indirect effects on the fetal brain
(Bergstro
¨m, 2003; Tincani et al., 2005; Seong et al., 2008; Romero
et al., 2014) that may be mediated in part by cytokine interactions
with placental toll-like receptors (Girard et al., 2010).
Consistent with an indirect action of maternal inflammation
on the fetal brain through alteration of placental function, our
results show that low-dose poly(I:C) exposure affects placental
TRP metabolism directly upstream of the fetus. The increase in

 placental Ido1 gene expression in response to inflammation dem-
onstrated here is consistent with previously published studies
(Shayda et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010) and, together with cyto-
kine measures, confirms that the injection of low-dose poly(I:C)
at E12 induces an inflammatory response in the mother that is
attenuated locally in the placenta. This upregulation of the IDO1
pathway is critical for the localized suppression of the maternal
immune response to protect the semiallogeneic fetus from rejec-
tion (Du et al., 2014). It was hypothesized recently that such
upregulation would lead to decreased TRP substrate availability
for the competing TPH1 pathway, ultimately decreasing placen-
tal output of 5-HT to the developing fetal brain (Sato, 2013).
Contrary to this hypothesis, our results reveal a transient increase
of TRP in the placenta 24 h after poly(I:C) exposure (Fig. 3F).
Simultaneously, 5-HT tissue concentration is increased in the
fetal forebrain (Fig. 3A), but not the placenta (Fig. 3E). Because
the maternal blood compartment represents �30% of the pla-
cental volume (Coan et al., 2008, 2010), these data suggest that
the maternal TRP, but not 5-HT, blood level is increased 24 h
after poly(I:C) injection. Importantly, placental TPH1 enzymatic
activity is normal at the 24 h time point (Fig. 2A); however, dose–
response studies (Fig. 3F) show that increasing concentrations of
TRP substrate (up to fourfold above the normal physiological
concentrations of � 60 �M; Schro
¨cksnadel et al., 2006) induce a
linear increase of 5-HT synthesis. By 48 h after poly(I:C) injec-
tion, the placental TRP concentration returns to control level
(Fig. 3E), whereas placental TPH1 enzymatic activity is increased
significantly compared with saline-injected controls (Fig. 2A).
Therefore, two different mechanisms contribute successively to
the elevation of fetal forebrain 5-HT measured 24 and 48 h after
maternal poly(I:C) injection: (1) 24 h after induction of maternal
inflammation, the transient elevation of maternal blood/placen-
tal TRP leads to increased output of placental 5-HT to the fetus
and (2) at 48 h, the placental TRP concentration has returned
back to normal levels (Fig. 3E) but TPH1 enzymatic activity is
increased (Fig. 2A), leading to increased placental 5-HT output to
Figure3.

 the fetus (Fig. 2B). This chronological sequence of molecular
changes results in a sustained elevation of fetal brain 5-HT lasting
for at least 48 h after induction of maternal inflammation. The
5-HTP intermediate metabolic product produced by placental
TPH1 activity (Fig. 3F) might also get converted to 5-HT within
the fetal forebrain; however, 5-HTP was not detected in the fetal
forebrain at either time point, suggesting that the contribution of
this pathway to the increase in 5-HT concentration is minimal.
The results also suggest that transfer of maternal blood 5-HT to
the fetus is unlikely to contribute to elevated fetal brain 5-HT
levels. Indeed, poly(I:C) injections do not alter total maternal
blood/placental 5-HT concentration significantly (Fig. 3E) and,
to our knowledge, there is no evidence of active transport of
5-HT across the placenta. Early studies (Robson and Senior,
1964) and more recent studies (Bonnin et al., 2011) show that
maternal blood 5-HT does not cross to the fetal compartment
to a measurable extent. In fact, the absence of active maternal-
fetal 5-HT transport during this time period (E12–E14) may
be consistent with the lack of 5-HT-specific transporter SERT
expression in early pregnancy in the mouse placenta (Ver-
haagh et al., 2001). Importantly, the increase of forebrain
5-HT is not associated with a decrease in 5-HIAA concentra-
tion, indicating that it does not result from decreased 5-HT
degradation in the fetal brain.

 The direct in vivo measure of increased 5-HT output from the
placenta to the fetal blood compartment in response to inflam-
matory challenge was not possible due to the very small volumes
of blood collected at E13/14. However, the data indicate that the
elevation of fetal forebrain 5-HT concentration measured after
the maternal immune challenge results directly from increased
placental 5-HT output. First, maternal inflammation upregulates
TRP substrate availability and TPH1 enzymatic activity in the
placenta, but not TPH2 activity in the fetal hindbrain (Fig. 2A).
Second, the increase of 5-HT tissue concentration is significant in
the fetal forebrain, but not hindbrain, where endogenous 5-HT
neuronal cell bodies and proximal axons are located. Third, im-
munohistochemical analysis shows that maternal inflammation
induces a significant decrease, not increase, of 5-HT axon out-
growth specifically into the rostral forebrain (Fig. 4B). Fourth,
coadministration of the selective TPH inhibitor pCPA prevents,
not only the accumulation of 5-HT, but also the blunting of
endogenous serotonergic axon outgrowth induced by maternal
inflammation in the fetal forebrain. This effect took place be-
tween E12 and E14, a period of active serotonergic axon out-
growth into the rostral forebrain (Lidov and Molliver, 1982;
Wallace and Lauder, 1983). The simultaneous increase in total
tissue 5-HT concentration and decrease of 5-HT axons density in
the forebrain indicates that, at early stages of development (be-
fore E14), tissue concentrations of 5-HT measured by HPLC re-
flect mainly extracellular rather than immunohistochemically
visible axonal 5-HT. A similar observation was made in the fetal
forebrain of E14 Pet-1 knock-out embryos, in which most of the
rostral forebrain serotonergic axon bundle is missing but which
contain a normal tissue concentration of 5-HT (Bonnin et al.,
2007). Increased extracellular 5-HT of placental origin may in
fact affect endogenous serotonergic axon outgrowth directly in
the rostral forebrain. Indeed, earlier studies showed that extracel-
lular 5-HT concentrations regulate 5-HT axon outgrowth
through subsets of 5-HT autoreceptors expressed either on dorsal
raphe 5-HT neuron cell bodies or axons (Daubert and Condron,
2010). This suggests that the blunted rostral serotonergic axon
outgrowth observed after maternal immune challenge may be a
direct consequence of elevated concentrations of exogenous pla-
cental 5-HT reaching the forebrain.
Together, these findings indicate that a mild and acute mater-
nal immune challenge disrupts placental conversion of TRP to
5-HT upstream of the fetal brain, which ultimately affects specific
aspects of fetal neurodevelopment (Fig. 4A,B). Importantly, al-
though the simultaneous increase of TRP metabolic flux through
both the IDO1 and TPH1 pathways in the placenta in response to
maternal
inflammation
provides
an
important
immune-
suppressive protection for the fetus, it also leads to increased fetal
brain exposure to elevated concentrations of 5-HT. Such an in-
crease in ligand concentration affects important developmental
processes in the fetal brain that are normally modulated by 5-HT
at early stages of pregnancy. A mild maternal inflammation trig-
gered by low-dose poly(I:C) exposure, similar to the challenge
used in the current study, was shown to have long-term effects on
offspring brain function and behavior, including disruption of
latent inhibition, spatial working memory impairment, and re-
duced spatial exploration (Meyer and Feldon, 2012). Although
these studies included doses and routes of administration for
poly(I:C) similar to those used in the present study, results indi-
cated that offspring behavioral outcomes are dose dependent and
potentially mouse strain dependent (Meyer and Feldon, 2012).
Nevertheless, it appears that prenatal inflammation can lead to
increased anxiety and depression-like behaviors in the offspring,
behaviors that are influenced by serotonergic function (Butkev-
ich et al., 2003; Enayati et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2012). The possibil-
ity that the effect of maternal inflammation on early serotonergic
development has long-term consequences on 5-HT-dependent
behaviors is also supported by studies showing that low-dose
poly(I:C) exposure during pregnancy decreases serotonergic tone
in specific brain regions of the adult offspring, such as the nucleus
accumbens and hippocampus (Winter et al., 2009). However, to
what extent the early specific disruptions of serotonergic circuit
formation reported here contribute to these long-term altera-
tions of offspring brain function requires additional character-
ization. Further studies on the effects of infectious agents on
placentally derived modulators of neurodevelopment are war-
ranted, particularly in view of recent infectious diseases out-
breaks (such as H1N1 influenza or Zika virus) suggesting that
pregnant women and their fetuses are high-risk groups for severe
and long-lasting complications (Omer and Beigi, 2016).
