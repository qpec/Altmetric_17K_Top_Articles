 Result(s)—No HIV transmission occurred in 11,585 cycles of assisted reproduction using 
washed semen among 3,994 women (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0–0.0001). Among the 
subset of HIV-infected men without plasma viral suppression at the time of semen washing, no 
HIV seroconversions occurred among 1,023 women following 2,863 cycles of assisted 
reproduction using washed semen (95%CI= 0–0.0006). Studies that measured HIV transmission to 
infants reported no cases of vertical transmission (0/1,026, 95% CI= 0–0.0029). Overall, 56.3% 
(2,357/4,184, 95%CI=54.8%–57.8%) of couples achieved a clinical pregnancy using washed 
semen.
Conclusion(s)—Semen washing appears to significantly reduce the risk of transmission in HIV-
discordant couples desiring children, regardless of viral suppression in the male partner. There are 
no randomized, controlled studies or studies from low-income countries, especially those with a 
large burden of HIV. Continued development of lower-cost semen washing and assisted 
reproduction technologies is needed. Integration of semen washing into HIV prevention 
interventions could help further reduce the spread of HIV.

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 37 million people are living with HIV worldwide (1) and over 80% of HIV-
infected individuals are of childbearing age (2). A cornerstone of successful HIV prevention 
campaigns has included the promotion of consistent condom use (3). However, many 
heterosexual HIV-discordant couples desire pregnancy (4, 5) and consistent condom usage 
impedes this desire. Couples may risk sexual HIV transmission in order to achieve 
pregnancy if they do not have access to safer reproductive methods (4, 6, 7). Semen washing 
is a safer reproductive strategy that HIV-discordant couples in which the male is infected 
can use to achieve pregnancy (8).
Semen washing removes spermatozoa, which are not vectors for HIV, from surrounding 
seminal fluid, and the HIV-negative sperm fractions are used in assisted reproduction (8). 
The first study from 1989 offering semen washing to HIV-discordant couples with 
intrauterine insemination (IUI) found no HIV transmission to 29 uninfected female partners 
(9). In the two decades following the introduction of semen washing, many more studies 
have evaluated the effect of this method in conjunction with assisted reproductive 
technologies, such as IUI, in vitro fertilization (IVF), and IVF with intracytoplasmic sperm 
injection (ICSI), on HIV transmission in HIV-discordant couples (10–12). We conducted a 
systematic review and meta-analysis of these studies in order to estimate the safety and 
effectiveness of semen washing in reducing HIV transmission in HIV-discordant couples in 
which the male is infected.
Three systematic reviews addressing prevention of HIV transmission in HIV-discordant 
couples following semen washing have been completed to date. The first by Vitorino et al. 
(10) included 17 observational studies published through December 2007. The second 
review by Eke et al. (11) searched for randomized controlled trials published through 
Zafer et al.

 December 2010 but did not identify any. The third review by Savasi et al. included 22 
observational studies through May 2012 (12). Our systematic review expands on all three 
reviews by including observational study designs, studies of any size, and studies published 
in any language through December 2014. Barnes et al. (13) published a related systematic 
review in 2014 that reviewed 24 articles with the primary objective to evaluate reproductive 
outcomes among HIV-affected couples following IUI and IVF, specifically fecundability, 
miscarriage rates, and multiple gestation rates. Our systematic review and meta-analysis 
complements the review by Barnes et al. (13) by evaluating the effectiveness of semen 
washing in reducing HIV transmission in HIV-discordant couples.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Using Cochrane Collaboration methods, we conducted a rigorous systematic review and 
meta-analysis. We assessed evidence quality with the GRADE methodology (14). We 
reported our findings in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (15).
We developed a search strategy to identify studies with abstracts published through 
December 2014 in four major electronic databases—MEDLINE (via PubMed), Cochrane 
Library, SCOPUS, and the WHO’s Global Index Medicus. We also searched the 
International AIDS Conference, British HIV Association Conference, International 
Conference of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Academy of HIV Medicine 
Conference, American Society for Reproductive Medicine Conference, European Society 
for Human Reproduction and Embryology Conference, and British Fertility Society 
Conference for relevant abstracts. In addition to National Library of Medicine Medical 
Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and other specialized syntax, our search strategies used key 
terms related to “sperm washing”, “assisted reproduction”, and “HIV”. We also hand 
searched the references of existing reviews and studies on semen washing. We considered 
articles irrespective of year of publication, language, or sample size.
The inclusion criteria for studies were: 1) studies that evaluated semen washing; 2) 
comparative and non-comparative observational and experimental studies, such as clinical 
trials, cohort studies, and pre-post-studies; 3) studies among HIV-discordant couples in 
which the male was infected and the female partner was attempting pregnancy; and 4) 
studies that reported the HIV status of the female partner before and after she underwent 
assisted reproduction with semen washing. Primary outcomes were serologic evidence of 
HIV infection in female partners following semen washing and virologic evidence of HIV 
infection in newborns following birth. We excluded studies that did not measure HIV status 
of the female partner before and after insemination with washed semen. Secondary 
outcomes included the proportion of women who achieved clinical pregnancy, the 
proportion of women who had spontaneous abortions/miscarriages, the proportion of infants 
born with low birth weight, and the proportion of deliveries that were premature. This 
review followed the “best available evidence approach” (16) and included single group, 
open label studies that evaluated all subjects before and after undergoing a single 
intervention. Although studies using a randomized, blinded control group are considered the

 highest quality, the best available evidence approach can be taken when these studies are not 
available (16).
Two authors (MZ and JB) independently screened abstracts gathered from electronic 
database and hand searches. Following discussion on discrepancies about abstract inclusion, 
the authors selected a list of articles for full text review. They independently extracted the 
following data from included studies and compiled them into pre-piloted data tables: 1) 
study details, including design, period of recruitment, setting, number of couples enrolled, 
eligibility criteria, method of semen washing and testing, and post-wash semen positivity; 2) 
time point for HIV testing of women and infants and the number of HIV seroconversions 
among both groups; 3) other clinical data, including viral loads and CD4 cell counts of male 
patients, and the proportion of male patients on antiretroviral therapy; 4) assisted 
reproductive techniques used (IUI, IVF, or IVF/ICSI); and 5) reproductive outcomes, 
including pregnancy, spontaneous abortions, low birth weight, and premature deliveries.
Our systematic review and meta-analysis did not involve human subjects and, therefore, did 
not require institutional review board approval.
Statistical analysis
We pooled data from the studies to derive an estimate of the total reported number of 
couples who have used semen washing, the total number of semen washing cycles that have 
been performed, and the total reported number of infants born among couples using this 
method. We calculated the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of HIV transmission risk per cycle 
and per couple for this pooled estimate according to the Jeffreys method (17). We used a 
one-sided exact binomial test to assess whether the overall probabilities of HIV transmission 
per cycle and per couple were lower than historical estimates of per-coital probability of 
HIV transmission, 0.1% (18, 19).
We calculated the proportion of women who acquired HIV for each study and a performed a 
proportion meta-analysis using the random effects methods of DerSimonian and Laird (20). 
We tested for heterogeneity in effects using the I2 statistic.
We calculated the proportion of women achieving clinical pregnancy by dividing the 
number of reported clinical pregnancies by the total number of cycles initiated, which 
included cancelled and completed cycles (21). Not all studies in this review reported 
pregnancy results, and studies that reported pregnancy results did not always report results 
per couple and per cycle. Moreover, not all studies reported pregnancy results disaggregated 
by type of assisted reproductive procedure (e.g. IUI vs. IVF or IVF/ICSI). Therefore, 
numerators and denominators for the pregnancy outcomes vary from the numerators and 
denominators for the HIV outcomes, and do not consistently sum up to the total number of 
events observed.
We also conducted a subgroup analysis among those couples in which the HIV-infected 
male partner had not achieved viral suppression (determined by plasma viral load) at the 
time of semen washing. This analysis estimated the independent effect of semen washing on 
HIV prevention in the absence of viral suppression. The subgroup included men without

 viral suppression regardless of antiretroviral use. When articles reported the number of men 
without viral suppression, but not the explicit number of cycles of assisted reproduction 
performed on their partners, we estimated this number by assuming that the subgroup 
underwent a similar number of cycles as couples with viral suppression. The definition of 
viral suppression used by authors of the included studies varied over time from <50 to <400 
copies/mL. In studies where neither viral load nor use of antiretroviral medication was 
reported, the authors contacted corresponding authors to request this information.
We conducted all data analyses using STATA software version 12.0 (StataCorp LP, College 
Station, Texas, USA).
Assessing the quality of evidence
In order to comment on the overall quality of evidence, we assessed the risk of bias in each 
study. This parameter is our main consideration because it informs how confidently we can 
believe the results of studies. There is no single generic instrument recommended for 
assessing bias risk in observational studies (22). To determine the risk of bias in each study, 
we adapted the GRADE Working Group (23) recommendations to assess the following 
limitations of observational studies: (1) failure to develop and apply appropriate eligibility 
criteria; (2) flawed measurement of both exposure and outcome; (3) failure to adequately 
control confounding; and (4) incomplete follow-up. GRADE is not typically used to assess 
evidence quality of outcomes reported in single-arm studies; therefore, we modified 
GRADE to evaluate evidence quality for HIV-related outcomes in our review.
RESULTS
Search results
The electronic database and conference website searches retrieved 249 relevant abstracts and 
hand searching of previous systematic reviews and studies, an additional six abstracts 
(Figure 1). Of these 255 abstracts, 12 were duplicates and after screening the remaining 243, 
we selected 47 for full-text review. These articles were published in English (n=40), Hebrew 
(n=2), Portuguese (n=2), Dutch (n=1), French (n=1), and Spanish (n=1). A total of 40 
studies (37 published articles and three conference abstracts) met our eligibility criteria and 
were included in this review (Table 1).
We found no randomized controlled trials. All included studies were single arm, open-label, 
pre-/post-test designs. Eighteen studies were prospective, 21 retrospective, and one 
evaluated both retrospective and prospective cohorts. All studies took place in high and 
upper-middle income countries representing the North American, European, Asian, and 
Latin American regions.
Population studied
In the 40 included studies, a total of 4,257 HIV-discordant couples completed 11,915 cycles 
of assisted reproduction following semen washing (Table 2). Men utilizing assisted 
reproductive services ranged in age from 29 to 58 years and women from 29 to 40 years 
(Supplemental Table 1). The vast majority of women (93.8%, 3,994/4,257) and completed

 cycles (97.2%, 11,585/11,915) had an HIV test result available before and after exposure to 
washed semen (Table 2).
Twenty-one studies reported antiretroviral use among male participants; of the 2,326 men in 
these studies, 641 (27.6%) were not taking antiretrovirals at the time of semen washing. 
Twenty-eight studies reported men’s plasma viral load; of the 1,890 men in these studies, 
985 (52.1%) were not virally suppressed at the time of semen washing. Overall, a minimum 
of 24% (1,023/4,257) of the 4,257 couples in the 40 studies were estimated to not have 
achieved viral suppression at the time of semen washing; this includes men without viral 
suppression at the time of semen washing (n=985) plus men without a viral load 
measurement, who were known to not be taking anti-retroviral medications (n=38). Among 
the 21 studies that reported CD4 levels, the average CD4 count of HIV-infected men ranged 
from 200 to 608 cells/µL.
Semen washing technique
Twenty-nine studies in this review reported washing semen using a technique invented by 
Semprini in 1989 (Table 1) (8). Some studies used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to 
detect HIV DNA and RNA in the washed semen fractions (24). Five studies reported post-
wash semen RNA positivity, ranging from 1.3% to 7.7% (25–29) (Table 1). Seminal 
fractions that tested positive for HIV were discarded.
HIV transmission following semen washing
There were no cases of HIV transmission following exposure to washed semen among 3,994 
women undergoing 11,585 cycles of assisted reproduction (0/11,585, 95% CI = 0–0.0001). 
This per cycle HIV transmission risk is significantly lower (P<0.001) than the historical 
HIV transmission risk estimate of 0.1% per act of unprotected vaginal intercourse (18, 19). 
Results of the meta-analysis are presented in Figure 2. Given there were no cases of HIV 
transmission in any study, the I2 score was 0% indicating no observed heterogeneity.
There were no HIV seroconversions among the subset of 1,023 couples in which the HIV-
infected male was not virally suppressed. These couples underwent an estimated 2,863 
cycles of assisted reproduction involving IUI, IVF, and IVF/ICSI (Table 2) and had an 
estimated per cycle risk of HIV seroconversion of 0 (0/2863, 95% CI = 0–0.0006). This per 
cycle HIV transmission risk is significantly lower (P=0.05) than the historical HIV 
transmission risk of 0.1% per act of unprotected vaginal intercourse (18, 19).
In studies that provided data on mother-to-child HIV transmission, there were no cases of 
vertical transmission among 1,026 newborns, either at birth or at the follow-up evaluations 
(0/1,026, 95% CI = 0–0.0029).
Pregnancy following semen washing with IUI, IVF, IVF/ICSI
Assisted reproduction techniques included IUI with ovarian stimulation or natural cycles 
(10), IVF or IVF/ICSI. In studies that reported pregnancy outcomes per women, of the 4,184 
couples that initiated a cycle of reproduction, 2,357 (56.3%, 95% CI=54.8%–57.8%) had a 
clinical pregnancy (Supplemental Table 1). Based on reported data, the proportions of

 couples achieving pregnancy undergoing IUI (56.4%, 95%CI=54.2%, 58.5%) and IVF or 
IVF/ICSI (58.1%, 95%CI=55.0%, 61.1%) were similar (P=0.37). In studies that reported 
pregnancy outcomes per cycle, 19.9% (95%CI=19.1%, 20.6%) of initiated assisted 
reproduction cycles resulted in a clinical pregnancy (Supplemental Table 1). In studies that 
reported data on spontaneous abortions, 17.0% (95%CI=15.4%, 18.6%) of clinical 
pregnancies ended with a spontaneous abortion. Rates of spontaneous abortions following 
IUI (15.5%, 95%CI=13,4%, 17.7%) and IVF or IVF/ICSI (17.7%, 95%CI=13.9%, 22.0%) 
were similar (P=0.32).
Four studies reported birth weight and preterm delivery outcomes (30–32). Of 259 infants, 
115 (44.4%) were born with low (<2500g) or very low (<1500g) birth weight and 107 
(41.3%) were born prematurely (prior to 37 weeks of gestation). All women who 
experienced premature delivery or gave birth to infants with low birth weight had undergone 
IVF or IVF/ICSI. The rate of multiple gestations among ongoing/delivered pregnancies was 
43.5% (81/186).
Quality of evidence
All of the 40 included studies enrolled populations of HIV-discordant couples that addressed 
the study question. Thirty-nine studies were conducted in a controlled manner with rigorous 
biological testing for HIV before and after semen washing to measure HIV seroconversion 
accurately. Individual studies did not calculate effect sizes, nor did they use statistical 
methods to adjust effect estimates. The risk of missing data was very low overall, with HIV 
results before and after exposure to washed semen available for 93.8% of women and 97.2% 
of cycles included in this review. Thirty-nine studies reported no loss to follow-up. Duration 
of follow-up ranged from 3 months to 12 months, which are appropriate lengths of follow-
up to monitor for HIV seroconversion.
DISCUSSION
This is the most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to date evaluating the 
effect of semen washing on HIV transmission among HIV-serodiscordant couples. We 
found that semen washing provides a safe and effective method for HIV serodiscordant 
couples to become pregnant. There were no instances of HIV seroconversion among HIV-
uninfected women inseminated with washed semen from their HIV-infected partners. The 
estimated per cycle HIV transmission risk following semen washing is significantly lower 
than historical estimates of HIV transmission risk per act of unprotected intercourse in both 
the overall population reviewed and the subgroup of men without viral suppression at the 
time of semen washing. Over half of couples in this review achieved a clinical pregnancy, 
and the rate of spontaneous abortions reported was similar to general population estimates 
(33). There were no cases of vertical transmission. HIV prevention programs that encourage 
couples to attempt pregnancy with washed semen as an alternative to intercourse without 
condoms may help to prevent the incidence of sexual transmission of HIV (6).
Approximately half, 52.1%, of men in studies that reported viral loads of participants were 
not virally suppressed at the time of semen washing. This number is an underestimate of the 
true number of men who were virally unsuppressed, as 12 of studies we reviewed did not

 report on viral load, and 19 did not report on antiretroviral use. The absence of HIV 
transmission in this subgroup of men without viral suppression suggests that semen washing 
may be a safer and more effective reproductive method in settings where men are unable or 
unwilling to initiate antiretroviral therapy, are non-adherent, or are not virally suppressed. 
For example, in sub-Saharan Africa it is estimated that at least one-third of individuals who 
have been taking antiretrovirals for 12 months do not attain viral suppression (34). 
Furthermore, up to 48% of men taking effective antiretroviral therapy with undetectable 
viral load in blood plasma samples have detectable virus in their semen (35, 36). Semen 
washing may be relevant in such settings where men can access antiretroviral therapy and 
are highly adherent to it, but remain at risk of transmitting HIV to their partners. Semen 
washing may offer a safer alternative to intercourse without condoms to prevent HIV 
transmission to the uninfected female partner.
Some have argued that IVF and IVF/ICSI have better fertility outcomes than IUI (31); 
however, the overall pregnancy success rates were similar between the methods in the HIV-
discordant population reviewed. Additionally, some have argued that IVF or IVF/ICSI poses 
less risk of HIV transmission than IUI because it uses a single spermatozoon (37). However, 
neither women nor newborns in the reviewed studies acquired HIV following IUI with 
washed semen. Additionally, the vast majority of assisted reproduction cycles performed 
used IUI. While lower cost IVF procedures are being developed and evaluated, the method 
is currently at least 10 times costlier than IUI in most settings (38, 39). Moreover, IVF is 
more invasive, carries some surgical risk, and requires additional clinic and laboratory 
capacity that may not exist in many low-resource settings. Therefore, IUI with washed 
semen may offer an effective, affordable, feasible, and safe strategy for preventing HIV 
transmission among HIV-discordant couples desiring children (40).
Traditionally, semen washing followed by assisted reproduction has been used to meet the 
needs of couples with infertility or subfertility. A 2012 WHO study reported that infertility 
affects one in four couples in developing countries (41). This study estimated that infertility 
globally affected 48.5 million heterosexual stable couples that had been attempting 
pregnancy for five or more years, of which 10 million lived in sub-Saharan Africa, the 
region most impacted by HIV (41). Safer conception strategies in these areas must consider 
not only the risk of HIV transmission but also underlying infertility.
Assisted reproduction with washed semen may help both fertile and infertile couples achieve 
pregnancy, while simultaneously reducing the risk of HIV transmission to the woman and 
her newborn. However, the availability of semen washing must be considered. Semen 
washing is currently provided by only a limited number of fertility or reproductive health 
centers worldwide. Establishing capacity for semen washing in any part of the world will 
depend on the availability of financial and clinical resources and expertise of clinical staff 
(40). Efforts to scale-up capacity for semen washing and the development of lower-cost 
procedures are warranted, particularly in HIV endemic settings.
Despite a comprehensive search of the scientific literature, without language restrictions, 
limitations to include only published studies, or sample size constraints, we did not find any 
published randomized control trials or cohort studies with an internal comparison group to

 test the effect of semen washing on HIV prevention in HIV-discordant couples. Without a 
matched and untreated comparison group, it is difficult to determine whether there would be 
a significant difference in the rate of HIV transmission between women inseminated with 
washed semen compared to those who were not. Given the absence of a direct comparison 
group, studies have evaluated their results against historical estimates of the overall risk of 
HIV transmission during unprotected intercourse. This comparison has its limitations (42). 
Furthermore, the lack of studies without a comparator group impacts the quality of our 
evidence. The GRADE approach to assessing evidence quality by outcome denotes data 
from observational studies with comparators as “low quality evidence” (23). Evidence 
quality can be graded down to very low due to a lack of internal comparators in the studies 
evaluated. Because our included studies are single-arm, observational trials, we assigned 
them a high risk of bias and graded the evidence quality down to very low (Supplemental 
Table 2).
The majority of studies included in this review did not report on differences in semen quality 
between patients with or without previous viral suppression. However, one study by 
Nicopollous et al. noted that semen parameters were not significantly different between men 
with detectable or undetectable viral loads, despite significantly lower CD4 counts among 
unsuppressed men. There is evidence in the literature that while HAART impairs semen 
parameters, resulting in lower ejaculate volume and sperm with less motility (43), HIV 
parameters such as CD4 cell count, viral load, and duration of antiretroviral therapy, are not 
significantly correlated with semen quality (44).
Studies included in this review did not report whether there were significant differences in 
pregnancy rates in the different techniques (IUI, IVF, ICSI) between patients with or without 
viral suppression. However, one study by Savasi et al. calculated the rates of clinical 
pregnancy following IUI among participants taking antiretroviral therapy and those not. The 
rate of clinical pregnancy per cycle in the group taking antiretroviral medication (17.4%, 
332/1902) was not significantly different (p = 0.105) from the rate of clinical pregnancy in 
the group not taking antiretroviral medication (25%, 124/498). Because IUI and IVF 
procedures typically wash sperm in order to prepare it for insemination regardless of the 
HIV status of the patient, this review is unable to comment on rates of birth outcomes 
following assisted reproduction without semen washing.
A future direction of research may explore the utility of conducting post-wash semen HIV 
testing. Very few (n=5) of the studies included in this review reported on this method. 
Additionally, no study compared rates of HIV transmission following assisted reproduction 
with or without post-wash semen HIV testing. Therefore, we are unable to comment on the 
utility of conducting post-wash semen HIV testing prior to IUI or IVF in this context.
This review has numerous strengths, including an exhaustive search strategy, inclusion of 20 
years’ of multi-country and multi-language studies, and the consistency of results across the 
included studies. Additional strengths of the studies included in this review include the use 
of serological and virologic testing of women before and after semen washing and extremely 
high rates of participant retention. Finally, a major strength of this review is its large sample

 size; this review includes 11,585 completed cycles of assisted reproduction with known HIV 
outcomes, and 2,863 cycles in which HIV-infected men had not attained viral suppression.
CONCLUSION
The absence of HIV seroconversion in the studies reviewed suggests that semen washing 
prevents HIV transmission in HIV-discordant couples attempting pregnancy where the male 
is infected. There is a lack of studies on semen washing from low-income and lower-middle 
income countries, including countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with a high HIV prevalence. 
Efforts to develop lower-cost semen washing and assisted reproduction technologies that can 
be used in less resourced settings are therefore warranted. Integration of semen washing into 
HIV prevention protocols may help curb the incidence of sexual HIV transmission.
