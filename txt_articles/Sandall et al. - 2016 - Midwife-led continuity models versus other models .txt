Background
Midwives are primary providers of care for childbearing women around the world. However, there is a lack of synthesised information
to establish whether there are differences in morbidity and mortality, effectiveness and psychosocial outcomes between midwife-led
continuity models and other models of care.
Objectives
To compare midwife-led continuity models of care with other models of care for childbearing women and their infants.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (25 January 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.
Selection criteria
All published and unpublished trials in which pregnant women are randomly allocated to midwife-led continuity models of care or
other models of care during pregnancy and birth.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. The
quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.
Main results
We included 15 trials involving 17,674 women. We assessed the quality of the trial evidence for all primary outcomes (i.e. regional
analgesia (epidural/spinal), caesarean birth, instrumental vaginal birth (forceps/vacuum), spontaneous vaginal birth, intact perineum,
preterm birth (less than 37 weeks) and all fetal loss before and after 24 weeks plus neonatal death using the GRADE methodology: all
primary outcomes were graded as of high quality.
For the primary outcomes, women who had midwife-led continuity models of care were less likely to experience regional analgesia
(average risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 0.92; participants = 17,674; studies = 14; high quality), instrumental

 vaginal birth (average RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.97; participants = 17,501; studies = 13; high quality), preterm birth less than 37
weeks (average RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.91; participants = 13,238; studies = eight; high quality) and less all fetal loss before and
after 24 weeks plus neonatal death (average RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.99; participants = 17,561; studies = 13; high quality evidence).
Women who had midwife-led continuity models of care were more likely to experience spontaneous vaginal birth (average RR 1.05,
95% CI 1.03 to 1.07; participants = 16,687; studies = 12; high quality). There were no differences between groups for caesarean births
or intact perineum.
For the secondary outcomes, women who had midwife-led continuity models of care were less likely to experience amniotomy (average
RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.98; participants = 3253; studies = four), episiotomy (average RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.92; participants
= 17,674; studies = 14) and fetal loss less than 24 weeks and neonatal death (average RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.98; participants =
15,645; studies = 11). Women who had midwife-led continuity models of care were more likely to experience no intrapartum analgesia/
anaesthesia (average RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.37; participants = 10,499; studies = seven), have a longer mean length of labour
(hours) (mean difference (MD) 0.50, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.74; participants = 3328; studies = three) and more likely to be attended at
birth by a known midwife (average RR 7.04, 95% CI 4.48 to 11.08; participants = 6917; studies = seven). There were no differences
between groups for fetal loss equal to/after 24 weeks and neonatal death, induction of labour, antenatal hospitalisation, antepartum
haemorrhage, augmentation/artificial oxytocin during labour, opiate analgesia, perineal laceration requiring suturing, postpartum
haemorrhage, breastfeeding initiation, low birthweight infant, five-minute Apgar score less than or equal to seven, neonatal convulsions,
admission of infant to special care or neonatal intensive care unit(s) or in mean length of neonatal hospital stay (days).
Due to a lack of consistency in measuring women’s satisfaction and assessing the cost of various maternity models, these outcomes were
reported narratively. The majority of included studies reported a higher rate of maternal satisfaction in midwife-led continuity models
of care. Similarly, there was a trend towards a cost-saving effect for midwife-led continuity care compared to other care models.
Authors’ conclusions
This review suggests that women who received midwife-led continuity models of care were less likely to experience intervention and
more likely to be satisfied with their care with at least comparable adverse outcomes for women or their infants than women who
received other models of care.
Further research is needed to explore findings of fewer preterm births and fewer fetal deaths less than 24 weeks, and all fetal loss/
neonatal death associated with midwife-led continuity models of care.

Midwife-led continuity models of care compared with other models of care for women during pregnancy, birth and early
parenting
What is the issue?
There are several ways to look after the health and well-being of women and babies during pregnancy, birth and afterwards - these
ways are called ‘models of care’. Sometimes, an obstetrician or another doctor is the lead healthcare professional and at other times it
is a midwife. Sometimes, the responsibility is shared between obstetricians and midwives. One of the models is called ‘the midwife-
led continuity model’. This is where the midwife is the lead professional starting from the initial booking appointment, up to and
including the early days of parenting. We wanted to find out if women and babies do better with this midwife-led continuity model,
compared with other models.
Why is this important?
Midwife-led continuity models provide care from the same midwife or team of midwives during the pregnancy, birth and the early
parenting period, and many women value this. These midwives also involve other care-providers if they are needed. Obstetrician-led
or family doctor-led models are not usually able to provide the same midwife/wives throughout. We need to know if the midwife-led
continuity model is safe, and if it brings benefits to mothers and babies.
What evidence did we find?
We identified 15 studies involving 17,674 mothers and babies (search date 25 January 2016). We included women at low risk of
complications as well as women at increased risk, but not currently experiencing problems. All the trials involved professionally-qualified

 midwives and no trial included models of care that offered home birth. We used reliable methods to assess the quality of the evidence
and looked at seven key outcomes: preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy); the risk of losing the baby in pregnancy or in
the first month after birth; spontaneous vaginal birth (when labour was not induced and birth not assisted by forceps; caesarean birth;
instrumental vaginal birth (births using forceps or ventouse); whether the perineum remained intact, and use of regional analgesia (such
as epidural).
The main benefits were that women who received midwife-led continuity of care were less likely to have an epidural. In addition, fewer
women had episiotomies or instrumental births. Women’s chances of a spontaneous vaginal birth were also increased and there was no
difference in the number of caesarean births. Women were less likely to experience preterm birth, and they were also at a lower risk of
losing their babies. In addition, women were more likely to be cared for in labour by midwives they already knew. The review identified
no adverse effects compared with other models.
The trials contributed enough high quality evidence for each key outcome to give us reliable results for each one. We can be reasonably
confident that future trials would find similar results for these outcomes.
What does this mean?
Most women should be offered ‘midwife-led continuity of care’. It provides benefits for women and babies and we have identified
no adverse effects. However, we cannot assume the same applies to women with existing serious pregnancy or health complications,
because these women were not included in the evidence assessed.

Description of the condition
In many parts of the world, midwives are the primary providers
of care for childbearing women (ten Hoope-Bender 2014). There
are, however, considerable variations in the organisation of mid-
wifery services and in the education and role of midwives (UNFPA
2014). Furthermore, in some countries, e.g. in North America,
medical doctors are the primary care providers for the vast ma-
jority of childbearing women, while in other countries, e.g. Aus-
tralia, New Zealand, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom and
Ireland, various combinations of midwife-led continuity, medical-
led, and shared models of care are available. Childbearing women
are often faced with different opinions as to which option might
be best for them (De Vries 2001). There is much debate about
the clinical and cost effectiveness of the different models of ma-
ternity care (Ryan 2013) and hence continuing debate on the op-
timal model of care for routine ante-, intra- and postnatal care for
healthy pregnant women (Sutcliffe 2012; Walsh 2012). This re-
view complements other work on models of maternity care and at-
tributes thereof, specifically, the work of Hodnett (Hodnett 2012)
and Olsen (Olsen 2012), in which the relationships between the
various birth settings and pregnancy outcomes were evaluated sys-
tematically. This review also subsumes the Cochrane review, ’Con-
tinuity of caregivers during pregnancy, childbirth, and the post-
partum period’ (Hodnett 2000).
Description of the intervention
Whilst it is difficult to categorise maternity models of care ex-
clusively due to the influence of generic policies and guidelines,
it is assumed that the underpinning philosophy of a midwife-
led model of care is normality and the natural ability of women
to experience birth without routine intervention. The midwife-
led continuity model of care is based on the premise that preg-
nancy and birth are normal life events. The midwife-led continuity
model of care includes: continuity of care; monitoring the physi-
cal, psychological, spiritual and social well being of the woman and
family throughout the childbearing cycle; providing the woman
with individualised education, counselling and antenatal care; at-
tendance during labour, birth and the immediate postpartum pe-
riod by a known midwife; ongoing support during the postnatal
period; minimising unnecessary technological interventions; and
identifying, referring and co-ordinating care for women who re-
quire obstetric or other specialist attention. Differences between
midwife-led continuity and other models of care often include
variations in philosophy, relationship between the care provider
and the pregnant woman, use of interventions during labour, care
setting (home, home-from-home or acute setting) and in the goals
and objectives of care (Rooks 1999).
Midwife-led continuity models of care
Midwife-led continuity of care has been defined as care where “the
midwife is the lead professional in the planning, organisation and
delivery of care given to a woman from initial booking to the
postnatal period” (RCOG 2001). Some antenatal and/or intra-
partum and/or postpartum care may be provided in consultation
with medical staff as appropriate. Within these models, midwives
are, however, in partnership with the woman, the lead professional
with responsibility for assessment of her needs, planning her care,
referral to other professionals as appropriate, and for ensuring pro-
vision of maternity services. Thus, midwife-led continuity mod-
els of care aim to provide care in either community or hospital
settings, normally to healthy women with uncomplicated or ’low-
risk’ pregnancies. In some models, midwives provide continuity
of midwifery care to all women from a defined geographical loca-
tion, acting as lead professional for women whose pregnancy and
birth is uncomplicated, and continuing to provide midwifery care
to women who experience medical and obstetric complications in
partnership with other professionals.
Some models of midwife-led continuity of care provide continuity
of care to a defined group of women through a team of midwives
sharing a caseload, often called ’team’ midwifery. Thus, a woman
will receive her care from a number of midwives in the team, the
size of which can vary. Other models, often termed ’caseload mid-
wifery’, aim to offer greater relationship continuity, by ensuring
that childbearing women receive their ante-, intra- and postna-
tal care from one midwife or her/his practice partner (McCourt
2006). There is continuing debate about the risks, benefits, and
costs of team and caseload models of midwife-led continuity of
care (Ashcroft 2003; Benjamin 2001; Green 2000; Johnson 2005;
Waldenstrom 1998).
Other models of care
Other models of care include the following (a) Obstetrician-pro-
vided care. This is common in North America, where obstetricians
are the primary providers of antenatal care for most childbearing
women. An obstetrician (not necessarily the one who provides
antenatal care) is present for the birth, and nurses provide intra-
partum and postnatal care.
(b) Family doctor-provided care, with referral to specialist obstetric
care as needed. Obstetric nurses or midwives provide intrapartum
and immediate postnatal care but not at a decision-making level,
and a medical doctor is present for the birth.
(c) Shared models of care, where responsibility for the organisation
and delivery of care, throughout initial booking to the postnatal
period, is shared between different health professionals.
At various points during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal
period, responsibility for care can shift to a different provider or
group of providers. Care is often shared by family doctors and mid-
wives, by obstetricians and midwives, or by providers from all three
groups. In some countries (e.g. Canada and The Netherlands),
the midwifery scope of practice is limited to the care of women
experiencing uncomplicated pregnancies, while in other countries
7

Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 (e.g. United Kingdom, France, Australia and New Zealand), mid-
wives provide care to women who experience medical and obstet-
ric complications in collaboration with medical colleagues. In ad-
dition, maternity care in some countries (e.g. Republic of Ireland,
Iran and Lebanon), is predominantly provided by a midwife but
is obstetrician-led, in that the midwife might provide the actual
care, but the obstetrician assumes overall responsibility for the care
provided to the woman throughout her ante-, intra- and postpar-
tum periods.
How the intervention might work
Continuity of care is a means of delivering care in a way which
acknowledges that a woman’s health needs are not isolated events,
and should be managed over time (Reid 2002). This longitudinal
aspect allows a relationship to develop between patients and their
providers of care, and contributes to the patients’ perception of
having a provider who has knowledge of their medical history, and
similarly an expectation that a known provider will care for them
in the future (Haggerty 2003). Continuity refers to a ‘coordinated
and smooth progression of care from the patient’s point of view’
(Freeman 2007) and therefore woman-centredness is an important
aspect in the delivery of continuity of care.
The general literature on continuity notes that a lack of clarity
in definition and measurement of different types of continuity
has been one of the limitations in research in this field (Haggerty
2003). Continuity has been defined by Freeman 2007 as having
three major types - management, informational and relationship.
Management continuity involves the communication of both facts
and judgements across team, institutional and professional bound-
aries, and between professionals and patients. Informational con-
tinuity concerns the timely availability of relevant information.
Relationship continuity means a therapeutic relationship of the
service user with one or more health professionals over time. Re-
lationship/personal continuity over time has been found to have a
greater effect on user experience and outcome (Saultz 2003; Saultz
2004; Saultz 2005). It has been argued that neither management
nor informational continuity can compensate for lack of an ongo-
ing relationship (Guthrie 2008). Midwife-led continuity models
of care have generally aimed to improve continuity of care over a
period of time. Some models of midwife-led care offer continuity
with a group of midwives, and others offer personal or relational
continuity, and thus the models of care that are the foci of this
review are defined as follows.
Why it is important to do this review
There has been a lack of a single source of synthesised evidence on
the effectiveness of midwife-led continuity models of care when
compared with other models of care. This review attempts to pro-
vide this evidence.
O B J E C T I V E S
The primary objective of this review is to compare the effects of
midwife-led continuity models of care with other models of care
for childbearing women and their infants.
We also explore whether the effects of midwife-led continuity of
care are influenced by: 1) models of midwife-led care that provide
differing levels of relationship continuity; 2) varying levels of ob-
stetrical risk.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised trials including trials using individual- or cluster-ran-
domisation methods. We also included quasi-randomised trials,
where allocation may not have been truly random (e.g. where al-
location was alternate or not clear).
Types of participants
Pregnant women.
Types of interventions
Models of care are classified as midwife-led continuity of care, and
other or shared care on the basis of the lead professional in the
antepartum and intrapartum periods. In midwife-led continuity
models of care, the midwife is the woman’s lead professional, but
one or more consultations with medical staff are often part of rou-
tine practice. Other models of care include: a) where the physician/
obstetrician is the lead professional, and midwives and/or nurses
provide intrapartum care and in-hospital postpartum care under
medical supervision; b) shared care, where the lead professional
changes depending on whether the woman is pregnant, in labour
or has given birth, and on whether the care is given in the hospital,
birth centre (free standing or integrated) or in community set-
ting(s); and c) where the majority of care is provided by physicians
or obstetricians.

Search methods for identification of studies
The following methods section of this review is based on a standard
template used by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.
Electronic searches
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Tri-
als Register by contacting the Trials Search Co-ordinator (25 Jan-
uary 2016).
The Register is a database containing over 20,000 reports of con-
trolledtrialsinthe fieldof pregnancyandchildbirth.Forfull search
methods used to populate the PCG Trials Register including the
detailedsearch strategiesforCENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and
CINAHL; the list of handsearched journals and conference pro-
ceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness
service, please follow this link to the editorial information about
the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group in The Cochrane
Library and select the ‘Specialized Register ’ section from the op-
tions on the left side of the screen.
Briefly, the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials
Register is maintained by the Trials Search Co-ordinator and con-
tains trials identified from:
1. monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);
2. weekly searches of MEDLINE (Ovid);
3. weekly searches of Embase (Ovid);
4. monthly searches of CINAHL (EBSCO);
5. handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major
conferences;
6. weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals
plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts.
Search results are screened by two people and the full text of all
relevant trial reports identified through the searching activities de-
scribed above is reviewed. Based on the intervention described,
each trial report is assigned a number that corresponds to a spe-
cific Pregnancy and Childbirth Group review topic (or topics),
and is then added to the Register. The Trials Search Co-ordina-
tor searches the Register for each review using this topic number
rather than keywords. This results in a more specific search set
which has been fully accounted for in the relevant review sections

Midwife-led continuity models versus other models of care for childbearing women (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 For this update, the following methods were used for assessing the
three reports that were identified as a result of the updated search.
The following methods section of this review is based on a standard
template used by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.
Selection of studies
Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all the
potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy. We
resolved any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we
consulted the third review author.
Data extraction and management
We designed a form to extract data. For eligible studies, two re-
view authors extracted the data using the agreed form. We resolved
discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we consulted the
third review author. Data were entered into Review Manager soft-
ware (RevMan 2014) and checked for accuracy.
When information regarding any of the above was unclear, we
planned to contact authors of the original reports to provide fur-
ther details.
One of the review authors (D Devane) is a co-author of one of
the included studies (Begley 2011), so was not involved in data
extraction or in the ’Risk of bias’ assessment for this study.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each
study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Sys-
tematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). Any disagreement
was resolved by discussion or by involving a third assessor.
(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible
selection bias)
We described for each included study the method used to generate
the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment
of whether it should produce comparable groups.
We assessed the method as:
• low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random
number table; computer random number generator);
• high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even
date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);
• unclear risk of bias.
(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection
bias)
We described for each included study the method used to con-
ceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed
whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in ad-
vance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.
We assessed the methods as:
• low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation;
consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);
• high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-
opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);
• unclear risk of bias.
(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for
possible performance bias)
We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to
blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which
intervention a participant received. We considered that studies
were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that
the lack of blinding unlikely to affect results. We assessed blinding
separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.
We assessed the methods as:
• low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;
• low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.
(3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible
detection bias)
We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to
blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a
participant received. We assessed blinding separately for different
outcomes or classes of outcomes.
We assessed methods used to blind outcome assessment as:
• low, high or unclear risk of bias.
(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition
bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete
outcome data)
We described for each included study, and for each outcome or
class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and
exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and ex-
clusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at
each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), rea-
sons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether miss-
ing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.
Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied
by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the
analyses which we undertook.
We assessed methods as:
• low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing
outcome data balanced across groups);
• high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data
imbalanced across groups; ‘as treated’ analysis done with
substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned
at randomisation);
• unclear risk of bias.

 (5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)
We described for each included study how we investigated the
possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.
We assessed the methods as:
• low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study’s pre-
specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the
review have been reported);
• high risk of bias (where not all the study’s pre-specified
outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary
outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are
reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to
include results of a key outcome that would have been expected
to have been reported);
• unclear risk of bias.
(6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not
covered by (1) to (5) above)
We described for each included study any important concerns we
had about other possible sources of bias.
(7) Overall risk of bias
We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high
risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Handbook
(Higgins 2011). With reference to (1) to (6) above, assessed the
likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we con-
sidered it is likely to impact on the findings. In future updates, we
will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking
sensitivity analyses - see Sensitivity analysis.
Assessment of the quality of the evidence using the
GRADE approach
For this update we assessed the quality of the evidence using the
GRADE approach as outlined in the GRADE Handbook. In or-
der to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the fol-
lowing outcomes for the main comparisons of midwife-led versus
all other models of care for childbearing women and their infants.
1. Preterm birth (less than 37 weeks)
2. All fetal loss before and after 24 weeks plus neonatal death
3. Spontaneous vaginal birth (as defined by trial authors)
4. Caesarean birth
5. Instrumental vaginal birth (forceps/vacuum)
6. Intact perineum
7. Regional analgesia (epidural/spinal)
We used GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool to import data
from Review Manager (RevMan 2014) in order to create a ’Sum-
mary of findings’ table. A summary of the intervention effect and
a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced
using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five con-
siderations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision,
indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body
of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded
from ’high quality’ by one level for serious (or by two levelsfor very
serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, in-
directness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect
estimates or potential publication bias. We have not downgraded
evidence for heterogeneity with an I² < 60%. We have not down-
graded for risk of bias due to lack of blinding.
Measures of treatment effect
Dichotomous data
For dichotomous data, we presented results as summary risk ratio
with 95% confidence intervals.
Continuous data
We used the mean difference if outcomes were measured in the
same way between trials. In future updates, as appropriate, we
will use the standardised mean difference to combine trials that
measure the same outcome, but used different methods.
Unit of analysis issues
Cluster-randomised trials
We included a cluster-randomised trial in the analyses along with
individually-randomised trials (North Stafford 2000). This trial
found a negative ICC so no adjustment was made for clustering.
We considered it reasonable to combine the results from cluster-
randomised trials and individually-randomised trials if there was
little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction
between the effectof intervention and the choice of randomisation
unit was considered to be unlikely.
Other unit of analysis issues
Multiple pregnancies were included and both infants included in
the denominator.
Dealing with missing data
For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. In future updates,
if more eligible studies are included, we will explore the impact
of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall
assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.
For all outcomes, analyses were carried out, as far as possible, on
an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all partici-
pants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator
for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus
any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.

 Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using
the Tau², I² and Chi² statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as sub-
stantial if an I² was greater than 30% and either a Tau² was greater
than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi²
test for heterogeneity. If we identified substantial heterogeneity
(above 30%), we planned to explore it by pre-specified subgroup
analysis.
Assessment of reporting biases
Where there were 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis we in-
vestigated reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel
plots. We assessed funnel plot asymmetry visually.
Data synthesis
We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager soft-
ware (RevMan 2014).
As there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the
underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or where sub-
stantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-
effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average
treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.
The random-effects summary was treated as the average of the
range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical
implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the
average treatment effect had not been clinically meaningful, we
would not have combined trials. The results were presented as the
average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the
estimates of Tau² and I².
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Where we identified substantial heterogeneity, we investigated it
using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We considered
whether an overall summary was meaningful, and if it was, we
used random-effects analysis to produce it.
We carried out the following subgroup analyses.
1. Caseload versus team models of midwifery care
2. Low-risk versus mixed-risk status
The following outcomes were used in subgroup analyses.
1. Regional analgesia (epidural/spinal)
2. Caesarean birth
3. Instrumental vaginal birth (forceps/vacuum)
4. Spontaneous vaginal birth (as defined by trial authors)
5. Intact perineum
6. Preterm birth (< 37 weeks)
7. All fetal loss before and after 24 weeks plus neonatal death
We assessed subgroup differences by interaction tests available
within RevMan (RevMan 2014). We reported the results of sub-
group analyses quoting the Chi² statistic and P value, and the in-
teraction test I² value.
Sensitivity analysis
We carried out sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of trial
quality assessed by concealment of allocation, high attrition rates,
or both, with poor quality studies being excluded from the analyses
in order to assess whether this made any difference to the overall
result.

Description of studies
Results of the search
Our search strategy identified 88 citations relating to 38 studies
in total. The updated search in May 2015 identified 11 new re-
ports. Four were additional reports of an already included study
McLachlan 2012; three new reports were included as Tracy 2013;
two reports were excluded (Famuyide 2014; Gu 2013); and one
was an additional reports of an excluded study (Walker 2012). A
final report, Allen 2013, was eligible for the review and included,
though this trial was a feasibility study and presents no usable data.
The updated search in January 2016 identified three new reports
relating to three already included studies in the review (Begley
2011; McLachlan 2012; Tracy 2013). Additional data were ex-
tracted from these new reports on the following outcomes: cost
(economic cost of care analysis) Begley 2011; and maternal sat-
isfaction (maternal experiences of childbirth) McLachlan 2012.
These data were reported narratively. No additional data were ex-
tracted from the additional report of Tracy 2013 which reports on
the number of midwives and health professionals seen by a subset
of publicly funded pregnant women.
Included studies
We included 15 trials involving 17,674 randomised women in
total (Allen 2013; Begley 2011; Biro 2000; Flint 1989; Harvey
1996; Hicks 2003; Homer 2001; Kenny 1994; MacVicar 1993;
McLachlan 2012; North Stafford 2000; Rowley 1995; Tracy
2013; Turnbull 1996; Waldenstrom 2001). See Characteristics of
included studies table.
Included studies were conducted in the public health systems in
Australia, Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom with vari-
ations in model of care, risk status of participating women and
practice settings. The Zelen method was used in three trials (Flint
1989; Homer 2001; MacVicar 1993), and one trial used cluster-
randomisation (North Stafford 2000).
Four studies offered a caseload model of care (McLachlan 2012;
North Stafford 2000; Tracy 2013; Turnbull 1996) and 10 studies
provided a team model of care: (Begley 2011; Biro 2000; Flint

 1989; Harvey 1996; Hicks 2003; Homer 2001; Kenny 1994;
MacVicar 1993; Rowley 1995; Waldenstrom 2001). The compo-
sition and modus operandi of the teams varied among trials. Levels
of continuity (measured by the percentage of women who were
attended during birth by a known carer varied between 63% to
98% for midwife-led continuity models of care to 0.3% to 21%
in other models of care).
Eight studies compared a midwife-led continuity model of care
with a shared model of care (Begley 2011; Biro 2000; Flint 1989;
Hicks 2003; Homer 2001; Kenny 1994; North Stafford 2000;
Rowley 1995), three studies compared a midwife-led continuity
model of care with medical-led models of care (Harvey 1996;
MacVicar 1993; Turnbull 1996), and three studies compared mid-
wife-led continuity of care with various options of standard care
including shared, medical-led and shared care (McLachlan 2012;
Tracy 2013; Waldenstrom 2001).
Participating women received ante-, intra- and postpartum care
in 13 studies (Begley 2011; Biro 2000; Flint 1989; Harvey
1996; Hicks 2003; Homer 2001; Kenny 1994; McLachlan 2012;
North Stafford 2000; Rowley 1995; Tracy 2013; Turnbull 1996;
Waldenstrom 2001), and antenatal and intrapartum care only in
one study (MacVicar 1993).
Some midwife-led continuity models included routine visits to the
obstetrician or family physicians (GPs), or both. The frequency
of such visits varied. Such visits were dependent on women’s risk
status during pregnancy (Biro 2000); routine for all women (one
to three visits) (Flint 1989; Harvey 1996; Kenny 1994; MacVicar
1993; McLachlan 2012; Rowley 1995; Waldenstrom 2001), or
based on the development of complications (Hicks 2003; Tracy
2013; Turnbull 1996) or antenatal care from midwives and, if
desired by the woman, from the woman’s general practitioner (
Begley 2011).
Women were classified as being at low risk of complications in
eight studies (Begley 2011; Flint 1989; Harvey 1996; Hicks 2003;
MacVicar 1993; McLachlan 2012; Turnbull 1996; Waldenstrom
2001) and as ’low and high’ and ’high’ in six studies (Biro 2000;
Homer 2001; Kenny 1994; North Stafford 2000; Rowley 1995;
Tracy 2013).
The midwifery models of care were hospital-based in four studies
(Biro 2000; MacVicar 1993; Rowley 1995; Waldenstrom 2001),
or offered (i) antenatal care in an outreach community-based clinic
and intra- and postpartum care in hospital (Homer 2001); (ii)
ante- and postpartum community-based care with intrapartum
hospital-based care (Hicks 2003; North Stafford 2000; Tracy
2013; Turnbull 1996) (iii) antenatal and postnatal care in the hos-
pital andcommunitysettingswith intrapartumhospital-basedcare
or (iv) postnatal care in the community with hospital-based ante-
and intrapartum care (Flint 1989; Harvey 1996; Kenny 1994;
McLachlan 2012). Four studies offered intrapartum care in home-
like settings, either to all women in the trial (Waldenstrom 2001),
or to women receiving midwife-led continuity of care only (Begley
2011; MacVicar 1993; Turnbull 1996).
Excluded studies
We excluded 22 studies (Berglund 1998; Berglund 2007; Bernitz
2011; Chambliss 1991; Chapman 1986; Famuyide 2014; Giles
1992; Gu 2013; Heins 1990; Hildingsson 2003; Hundley 1994;

 Allocation
Ten studies reported genuine random methods of generation of
the randomisation sequence (Begley 2011; Biro 2000; Harvey
1996; Hicks 2003; Homer 2001; MacVicar 1993; McLachlan
2012; Rowley 1995; Tracy 2013; Turnbull 1996). Five gave no or
insufficient information to form a clear judgement (Allen 2013;
Flint 1989; Kenny 1994; North Stafford 2000; Waldenstrom
2001).
Allocation concealment was judged low risk of bias for 11 studies
(Begley2011; Biro 2000; Harvey 1996, Hicks 2003; Homer 2001;
Kenny 1994; MacVicar 1993; McLachlan 2012; Tracy 2013;
Turnbull 1996; Waldenstrom 2001). Three studies were judged
unclear risk of bias: Rowley 1995 and Allen2013 gave no informa-
tion about the process of random allocation; and Flint 1989 used
sealed opaque envelopes but did not specify any numbering. The
North Stafford 2000 trial was a cluster-randomised trial, whereby
allocation concealment was not possible and it was judged high
risk of bias for allocation concealment.
Blinding
Six of the included studies were judged as high risk in blinding of
participants and personnel (Begley 2011; Homer 2001; MacVicar
1993; North Stafford 2000; Rowley 1995; Tracy 2013) and nine
studies were of unclear risk of bias (Allen 2013; Biro 2000; Flint
1989; Harvey 1996; Hicks 2003; Kenny 1994; McLachlan 2012;
Turnbull 1996; Waldenstrom 2001).
One study was at low risk of bias for blinding of outcome assess-
ment (McLachlan 2012), four were judged as high risk of bias
(Begley 2011; Homer 2001; Rowley 1995; Tracy 2013), and 10
studies were at unclear risk of bias (Allen 2013; Biro 2000; Flint
1989; Harvey 1996; Hicks 2003; Kenny 1994; MacVicar 1993;
North Stafford 2000; Turnbull 1996; Waldenstrom 2001).
Incomplete outcome data
Twelve of the included studies were judged at low risk of bias for in-
complete outcome data on the basis that attrition rate was less than
20% for all outcomes (other than satisfaction), or missing out-
come data were balanced across groups (Begley 2011; Biro 2000;
Flint 1989; Harvey 1996; Hicks 2003; Homer 2001; Kenny 1994;
McLachlan 2012; North Stafford 2000; Tracy 2013; Turnbull
1996; Waldenstrom 2001). Two of the studies (MacVicar 1993;
Rowley 1995) did not provide sufficient information on loss to
follow-up and were judged as unclear. A feasibility study was also
judged as unclear (Allen 2013).
Selective reporting
All outcomes stated in the methods section were adequately re-
ported in the results in 13 studies (Begley 2011; Biro 2000; Flint
1989; Harvey 1996; Hicks 2003; Homer 2001; Kenny 1994;
MacVicar 1993; McLachlan 2012; North Stafford 2000; Rowley
1995; Turnbull 1996; Waldenstrom 2001). Two trials were judged
to be of unclear risk of bias due to reporting: Allen 2013, a fea-
sibility recruiting just one woman to the intervention and Tracy
2013, where we emailed the trial authors for clarification of data
and additional data.
Other potential sources of bias
No other potential sources of bias were identified in most included
studies. A feasibility study (Allen 2013) was considered of unclear
risk, as was Tracy 2013, where a small proportion of women were
crossed-over from each arm.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings forthe main comparisonMidwife-led
compared with other models of care for childbearing women and
their infants (all) for childbearing women
We used random-effects for all analyses. Where we identified sta-
tistical heterogeneity (I² > 30%) we have reported the values of
both Tau² and I². Because our subgroup analyses (reported below)
did not generally explain heterogeneity found in specific primary
outcomes, we discuss additional sources of heterogeneity below
and in the discussion section of the review.
Comparison 1 (main comparison): midwife-led
continuity models of care versus other models of care
for childbearing women and their infants - all trials
Primary outcomes
Women randomised to midwife-led continuity models of care
were, on average, less likely to experience:
• regional analgesia (epidural/spinal) (average risk ratio
(RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 0.92;
participants = 17,674; studies = 14; I² = 57%; high quality
evidence) (Analysis 1.1);
• instrumental vaginal birth (forceps/vacuum) (average RR
0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.97; participants = 17,501; studies = 13;
high quality evidence) (Analysis 1.3);
• preterm birth < 37 weeks (average RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64
to 0.91; participants = 13,238; studies = eight; I² = 33%; high
quality evidence) (Analysis 1.6).
We conducted pre-specified subgroup analysis to investigate het-
erogeneity in the above outcomes of regional analgesia and preterm
16

 birth. Assumed differences between caseload or team models of
care versus other models of care could not explain the heterogene-
ity for these outcomes, and neither could potential differences be-
tween low-risk and mixed-risk groups of pregnant women (see
analyses for regional analgesia Analysis 2.1 and Analysis 3.1 and
for preterm birth Analysis 2.6 and Analysis 3.6).
Women randomised to midwife-led continuity models of care
were on average more likely to experience:
• a spontaneous vaginal birth (average RR 1.05, 95% CI
1.03 to 1.07; participants = 16,687; studies = 12; high quality
evidence) (Analysis 1.4).
There were no statistically significant differences between
groups for the following outcomes:
• caesarean birth (average RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.00;
participants = 17,674; studies = 14; high quality evidence)
(Analysis 1.2);
• intact perineum (average RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.13;
participants = 13,186; studies = 10; high quality evidence)
(Analysis 1.5); there was moderate heterogeneity for this
outcome (Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.01; I² = 54%), and this could
not be attributed to differences in the pre-specified subgroups
(see below and Analysis 2.5 and Analysis 3.5).
The difference in the average treatment effect in all fetal loss be-
fore and after 24 weeks plus neonatal death across included trials
between women allocated to midwife-led continuity models of
care and women allocated to other models has an average RR of
0.84, with 95% CI 0.71 to 0.99. Given that (i) the 95% CI just
reaches 0.99 and (ii) the absence of measurable heterogeneity in
this outcome analysis, the probability is that midwife-led conti-
nuity models of care are associated with a reduction in fetal loss
and neonatal death by approximately 16%.
• all fetal loss before and after 24 weeks plus neonatal
death (average RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.99; participants =
17,561; studies = 13; high quality evidence) (Analysis 1.7).
Secondary outcomes
Women randomised to midwife-led continuity models of care
were, on average, less likely to experience:
• amniotomy (average RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.98;
participants = 3253; studies = four; I² = 75%) (Analysis 1.11);
• episiotomy (average RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.92;
participants = 17,674; studies = 14; I² = 47%) (Analysis 1.16);
• fetal loss less than 24 weeks and neonatal death (average
RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.98; participants = 15,645; studies =
11) (Analysis 1.27).
Women randomised to midwife-led continuity models of care
were on average more likely to experience:
• no intrapartum analgesia/anaesthesia (RR 1.21, 95% CI
1.06 to 1.37; participants = 10,499; studies = seven; I² = 49%)
(Analysis 1.13);
• a longer mean length of labour (hours) (mean difference
(MD) 0.50, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.74; participants = 3328; studies =
three) (Analysis 1.18); however, there was evidence of skewness
in the data from one of the trials in the analyses of length of
labour (Turnbull 1996);
• women allocated to midwife-led continuity models of care
were more likely to be attended at birth by a known midwife
(RR 7.04, 95% CI 4.48 to 11.08; participants = 6917; studies =
seven); however, the effect estimates for individual studies are

 (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.49; participants = 17,359; studies =
12; I² = 0%) (Analysis 1.28).
There was substantial statistical heterogeneity in many of the anal-
yses. The I² value was greater than 50% for 10 outcomes (ante-
natal hospitalisation, amniotomy, augmentation, opiate analgesia,
attendance at birth by known carer, intact perineum, perineum
requiring suturing, duration of postnatal hospital stay, duration of
neonatal stay, breastfeeding initiation, and greater than 30% for
a further six (antepartum haemorrhage, induction of labour, epi-
siotomy, five-minute Apgar score less than seven, preterm birth,
admission to neonatal care). It is likely that heterogeneity could be
due to the nature of the complexity of the intervention of a model
of care, with variation in case mix and organisational setting.
Investigation of publication bias
Visual inspection of funnel plots for analyses where there were
10 or more studies (Analysis 1.1, Analysis 1.2, Analysis 1.3,
Analysis 1.4, Analysis 1.5, Analysis 1.7, Analysis 1.10, Analysis
1.12, Analysis 1.14, Analysis 1.16, Analysis 1.17, Analysis 1.19,
Analysis 1.23, Analysis 1.25, Analysis 1.27 and Analysis 1.28) sug-
gested little evidence of asymmetry for most analyses. For three
analyses (Analysis 1.1 regional analgesia, Analysis 1.2 caesarean
delivery and Analysis 1.16 episiotomy), there was a some sugges-
tion of asymmetry, though in all cases this was due to two small
trials with large treatment effects in the same direction (Harvey
1996 and Hicks 2003, see Figure 3; Figure 4; Figure 5). There
is therefore no strong evidence of reporting bias, though this is
difficult to detect with the number of studies in this review, and
whether it exists and the extent to which it affects the results may
be clarified when more studies have been conducted.

Outcomes reported in single trials or not at all
It was not possible to analyse the following outcomes, either be-
cause data were not reported by any studies or they were reported
in a way that did not allow extraction of the necessary data for
meta-analysis, or losses and exclusions were more than 20% of
the randomised participants. No maternal deaths were reported.
Only one trial reported the following outcomes: mean number of
antenatal visits, perceptions of control, breastfeeding on discharge
and postpartum depression and so results were not included in a
meta-analysis. No trials reported on longer-term outcomes: any
breastfeeding at three months; prolonged perineal pain; pain dur-
ing sexual intercourse; urinary incontinence; faecal incontinence;
and prolonged backache.
Subgroup analyses
Comparison 2: variation in midwifery models of care
(caseload or one-to-one versus team)
Four trials randomised 6782 women to compare a caseload model
of care (defined as one midwife carrying responsibility for a de-
fined caseload of women in partnership with a midwife part-
ner) with other models of care (McLachlan 2012; North Stafford
2000; Tracy 2013; Turnbull 1996). Caseload size was reported
to be 45 women per midwife per year (McLachlan 2012), 35 to
40 women (North Stafford 2000), 40 women (Tracy 2013) and
32.4 women per midwife (Turnbull 1996). Ten trials randomised
11,183 women to compare team models of midwifery (defined as a
group of midwives sharing responsibility for a caseload of women)
with other models of care (Begley 2011; Biro 2000; Flint 1989;
Harvey 1996; Hicks 2003; Homer 2001; Kenny 1994; MacVicar
1993; Rowley 1995; Waldenstrom 2001).
On the whole, there was no evidence of a difference between the
caseload and team subgroups for any of the outcomes included in
the subgroup analysis, which included caesarean section, instru-
mental vaginal birth, spontaneous vaginal birth, intact perineum,
preterm birth < 37 weeks and all fetal loss before and after 24
weeks plus neonatal death.
There were borderline differences between subgroups for the out-
come of regional analgesia (Test for subgroup differences: (P =
0.10), I² = 63.4%). Both caseload and team care (average RR 0.92,

 95% CI 0.82 to 1.04; participants = 6782; studies = four; I² =
56%) and other models of care (average RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73 to
0.89; participants = 10,892; studies = 10; I² = 44%) had substan-
tial heterogeneity. Due to heterogeneity and to the small number
of trials in each subgroup, we would advise caution when inter-
preting this result (Analysis 2.1).
Comparison 3: variation in risk status (low risk versus mixed)
Eight trials randomised 11,195 women to compare midwife-led
continuity models of care versus other models of care in women
defined to be at low risk by trial authors (Begley 2011; Flint
1989; Harvey 1996; Hicks 2003; MacVicar 1993; McLachlan
2012; Turnbull 1996; Waldenstrom 2001). Six trials randomised
over 6578 women to compare midwife-led continuity models of
care with other models of care in women defined to be at mixed
risk of complications by trial authors (Biro 2000; Homer 2001;
Kenny 1994; North Stafford 2000; Rowley 1995; Tracy 2013;).
Of these, two trials excluded women who booked late - after 24
weeks’ gestation (Biro 2000; Homer2001) and 16 weeks’ gestation
(Kenny1994). Twotrialsexcludedwomenwith asubstance misuse
problem (Kenny 1994; Rowley 1995), and two trials excluded
women with significant medical disease or previous history of a
classical caesarean or more than two caesareans (Homer 2001), or
women requiring admission to the maternal fetal medicine unit
(Biro 2000).
There was no evidence of differences in treatment effect between
the low risk and mixed risk subgroups for any of the outcomes
included (see Analysis 3.1 to Analysis 3.7).
Maternal satisfaction
Due to the lack of consistency in conceptualisation and measure-
ment of women’s experiences and satisfaction of care, a narrative
synthesis of such data are presented. Ten studies reported maternal
satisfaction with various components of the childbirth experiences
(Biro 2000; Flint 1989; Harvey 1996; Hicks 2003; Kenny 1994;
MacVicar 1993; McLachlan 2012; Rowley 1995; Turnbull 1996;
Waldenstrom 2001).
Given the ambiguity surrounding the concept of satisfaction, it
was not surprising to find inconsistency in the instruments, scales,
timing of administration and outcomes used to ’measure’ satisfac-
tion across studies. Because of such heterogeneity and as might be
expected, response rates of lower than 80% for most of these stud-
ies, meta-analysis for the outcome of satisfaction was considered
inappropriate and was not conducted.
Satisfaction outcomes reported in the included studies included
maternal satisfaction with information, advice, explanation, venue
of delivery, preparation for labour and birth, as well as giving
choice for pain relief and behaviour of the carer. One study assessed
perceptions of control in labour (Flint 1989), using a three-point
scale. For convenience and ease of understanding, tabulated results
of the overall satisfaction or indicators which directly relate to staff
attitude, or both, are presented in Table 1. In brief, the majority
of the included studies, showed a higher level of satisfaction in
various aspects of care in the midwife-led continuity compared to
the other models of care.
A second study (McLachlan 2012) assessed women’s experience of
childbirth in a postal survey. Women receiving caseload midwifery
care were more likely to rate their experience of childbirth as very
positive overall. These women reported a more positive experience
of pain overall and more often reported feeling very proud of
themselves. Women also felt more in control and more able to cope
physically and emotionally; all of these outcome data are taken
directly from the Machlachlan 2015 report and displayed in our
Table 2 below.
Sensitivity analyses
We performed a sensitivity analysis excluding the cluster-ran-
domised North Staffordshire trial from all outcomes in the pri-
mary comparison (comparison 1) for which it had contributed
data (North Stafford 2000). This did not alter the findings for
any outcome, which remained consistent with overall findings
with all trials included. Similarly, a sensitivity analysis for the pri-
mary outcomes including only the studies rated at low risk of
bias(Begley 2011; Biro 2000; Harvey 1996; Hicks 2003; Homer
2001; McLachlan 2012; Turnbull 1996), found that there were
only minor differences from the overall analyses. The main conse-
quence was that confidence intervals were slightly wider, because
of the smaller number of trials in the analysis. In no case were the
conclusions of the analysis different. The primary outcome with
the largest difference in this sensitivity analysis was preterm birth,
where an analysis restricted to trials with lower risk of bias sug-
gested a larger treatment effect: RR 0.64, (95% CI 0.51 to 0.81)
compared with RR 0.77, (95% CI 0.62 to 0.94) in the overall
analysis.
Economic analysis
Findings from economic analyses will vary depending on the struc-
ture of health care in a given country and what factors are in-
cluded in the modelling. Due to the lack of consistency in mea-
surement of economic evaluations, a narrative synthesis of such
data are presented. Seven studies presented economic analysis in
which various measures and items were included in the final cost
estimation (Begley 2011; Flint 1987; Homer 2001; Kenny 1994;
Rowley 1995; Tracy 2013; Young 1997).
Kenny 2015 reports an economic evaluation based on the Begley
2011 trial. Because the trial found no differences in the effect
of type of care on any primary clinical outcome, the economic
analysis compares only the costs of care rather than their cost-
effectiveness. Both midwifery-led care and obstetric-led care were
shown to be equally safe and effective in the trial, but the costs
21

 of midwife-led care were lower, contributing to a cost saving of
EUR 182 per pregnant woman receiving midwife-led care using
an ’intention-to-treat’ analysis.
Flint 1989 examined the costs for a subgroup of women (n = 49)
and estimated costs for antenatal admission and antenatal care,
and found antenatal care was 20% to 25% cheaper for women
in the midwife-led continuity of care group due to differences in
staff costs. Women in the midwife-led continuity of care group
had fewer epidurals (GBP 19,360 versus GBP 31,460).
Kenny 1994 examined the costs of care in detail. The average cost/
client in the antenatal period was AUD 158 midwife-led continu-
ity of care and AUD 167 control. For high-risk women the aver-
age cost/client was AUD 390 midwife-led continuity of care and
AUD 437 control, and for low-risk women AUD 119 midwife-
led continuity of care and AUD 123 control. The average cost per
woman for intrapartum care was AUD 219 midwife-led continu-
ity of care and AUD 220 control and for postnatal care was AUD
745 midwife-led continuity of care and AUD 833 control. The
total cost/woman was AUD 1122 for midwife-led continuity of
care and AUD 1220 control.
Rowley 1995 used the Australian national cost weights for diag-
nostic-related groups (AN-DRGs) to estimate maternity care in
each study group. The average cost per delivery was higher in
the standard care group (AUD 3475) compared to the team-mid-
wifery group (AUD 3324). This method was limited to the acute
inpatient and did not include antenatal or postnatal care cost esti-
mations. An assessment of midwife salaries from the first antenatal
visit up to and including labour and delivery care resulted in a
cost of AUD 653 for each team care woman and $688 for each
routine care woman. The amount of sick leave taken by team care
midwives was half that taken by standard care midwives.
Tracy 2013 calculated cost outcomes per woman on the basis
of activity-based funding codes (Australian-refined Diagnosis-Re-
lated Group classification [DRG] codes). Expenditure data were
obtained from the hospital financial systems, which provided de-
tailed information about inpatient contacts for the mother and
baby.The per-woman cost of care calculated included both direct
and indirect costs for each full episode of maternity care, taking
account of the length of hospital stay for each woman. Direct and
indirect costs were calculated for midwifery and obstetric clinical
time; use of operating theatres, laboratory tests, imaging, wards,
allied health, pharmacy; capital depreciation; and clinical over-
heads. Costs for each full episode of maternity care we recalcu-
lated from the sum of the services provided to the woman for the
duration of her stay. Neonatal costs were not reported. Caseload
midwifery care for unassisted vaginal birth cost significantly less
than standard maternity care. This difference contributed to a sig-
nificant difference in the overall median cost of birth per woman
of AUD 566.74 (95% CI 106.17 to 1027.30) P = 0·02). How-
ever, the cost data showed several high-cost outliers greater than
$30,000, which were due to serious medical disorders, surgical
complications, or accidental causes. The largest outlier, which cost
more than $40,000, was due to a motor vehicle accident. The to-
tal cost of care per woman was AUD 566.74 (95% CI 106.17 to
1027.30); P = 0·02) less for caseload midwifery than for standard
maternity care.
Young 1997 (costanalysis,Turnbull 1996)usedthe “individual pa-
tient-based costing” approach, in which an assumption was made
about the number of caseloads per midwife. When the assumption
was based on a median caseload of 29 women per midwife, the cost
of midwife managed care was not significantly different from the
shared-care group in the antenatal and intrapartum periods, but
it was higher in the postpartum period. The authors also used an
alternative assumption including a caseload of 39 women per mid-
wife. A lower cost in the antenatal period for the midwife-man-
aged care was shown in comparison with the shared-care group
(mean: GPD 346 versus GPD 384, P = 0.05), but the postnatal
care cost remained higher in the former group (GPD 444 versus
GPD 397, respectively, P < 0.01). The authors did not recalculate
the cost of intrapartum care for the second assumption, and used
the same estimation as for the 29 caseload per midwife (since they
indicated that the main effects were in the unit costs of clinic and
home visits). They reported no significant differences between the
midwifery and shared-care group, in the cost of intrapartum care
(GPD 280 versus GPD 276, P = 0.4).
Homer 2001 calculated the costs of all aspects of care from the
healthcare provider’s perspective, including salaries and wages;
goods and services; and repair, maintenance and renewal (RMR).
The associated costs for all stages of antenatal, intrapartum and
postnatal care were calculated and presented as the mean cost per
woman per group. The results showed a cost-saving effect in the
team midwifery group compared with the standard care arm of
the study (mean cost per woman: AUD 2579 versus AUD 3483,
respectively).
In summary, six studies presented cost data using different eco-
nomic evaluation methods. All studies suggest a cost-saving effect
in intrapartum care. One study suggests a higher cost, and one
study no differences in cost of postnatal care when midwife-led
continuity of care is compared with medical-led maternity care.
There is a lack of consistency in estimating maternity care cost
among the available studies; however, there seems to be a trend
towards the cost-saving effect of midwife-led continuity of care in
comparison with medical-led care.

Summary of main results
This review summarises 15 trials involving 17,674 women that
took place in four countries in a wide variety of settings and health
systems. All trials involved midwife-led continuity models of care
that included either team or caseload midwifery, and women clas-
sified as at low or mixed risk. All trials included licensed mid-
22

 wives, and none included lay or traditional midwives. The review
includes trials that compared midwife-led continuity of care given
both duringthe antepartumandthe intrapartumperiodwith other
models of care, which included obstetricians or family physicians,
or both, collaborating with nurses and midwives in a variety of or-
ganisational settings. No trial included models of care that offered
out of hospital birth.
In the primary comparison, the results consistently show less use
of some interventions for women who were randomised to receive
midwife-led continuity of care compared to women randomised
to receive other models of care without detriment to outcomes.
Specifically, women were on average less likely to experience re-
gional analgesia, episiotomy, and instrumental birth. Women were
on average more likely to experience spontaneous vaginal birth,
a longer mean length of labour, and to be attended at birth by a
known midwife, however, there were no differences in caesarean
birth rates.
Stillbirth is not reported specifically due to differing gestational
definitions, but is included within the outcome ‘Fetal loss equal
to/after 24 weeks and neonatal death’. Women who were ran-
domised to receive midwife-led continuity of care compared to
women randomised to receive other models of care were, on av-
erage, less likely to experience fetal loss less than 24 weeks and
neonatal death and preterm birth before 37 weeks. The difference
in the average treatment effect in all fetal loss before and after 24
weeks plus neonatal death across included trials between women
allocated to midwife-led continuity models of care and women
allocated to other models has an average risk ratio (RR) of 0.84,
with 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.99 (participants =
17561; studies = 13). Given that (i) the 95% CI just reaches 0.99
and (ii) the absence of measurable heterogeneity in this outcome
analysis, the probability is that midwife-led continuity models of
care are associated with a reduction in fetal loss and neonatal death
by approximately 16%.
We conducted pre-specified subgroup analysis to investigate het-
erogeneity in the above outcomes of regional analgesia and preterm
birth. The subgroup analyses of models of midwife-led continuity
of care and risk status did not find any significant subgroup inter-
action tests, indicating that there is no observable subgroup effect.
It is possible that the complexity of the intervention in a range of
settings and populations may influence the heterogeneity found.
Overall, we did not find any increased likelihood for any adverse
outcome for women or their infants associated with having been
randomised to a midwife-led continuity model of care. These re-
sults were moderate in magnitude and generally consistent across
all the trials.
It is possible that practice settings such as midwife-led units can
be a confounding influence on outcomes of midwife-led conti-
nuity of care (Brocklehurst 2011), although home birth was not
offered in any of the trials. Four trials offered care in midwife-led
units (Begley 2011; MacVicar 1993; Turnbull 1996; Waldenstrom
2001), which was available to women in both arms of one trial
(Waldenstrom 2001), and only women in the midwife-led group
in three trials (Begley 2011; MacVicar 1993; Turnbull 1996). The
increased likelihood of spontaneous vaginal birth in women ran-
domised to midwife-led continuity models of care may be a func-
tion of increased mobility due to less use of a range of analgesics,
a much greater likelihood of attendance at birth by a known mid-
wife, and the philosophy of care on offer. Midwife-led continuity
of care is a complex intervention, and it is impossible to unpick the
relative importance of philosophy and continuity of care. How-
ever, in 10 trials, care was provided on the labour ward, suggesting
a separate effect of birth setting. To what extent the observed ben-
efits can be attributed to the model of midwifery care, midwifery
philosophy, or to the quality and degree of relationship between
the care provider and women was outside the scope of this review
and requires an in-depth exploration of the mechanisms through
which midwife-led care might work.
The possible effectsonfetal lossandthe substantive 24%reduction
in preterm birth are important. Aetiology of both these events are
complex but potentially influenced by models of care. Medical
interventions to prevent fetal loss prior to 24 weeks do exist, as this
is mostly due to spontaneous miscarriage, (and are dependent on
quick access to care potentially influenced by continuity), such as
cerclage and progesterone. These interventions are targeted to ’at
risk’ women, and may explain why mixed-risk populations (with
the improved access to care and appropriate referral) have the
effect. Low-risk women may not be referred or when referred the
interventions not used due to lack of evidence in low-risk women.
There is insufficient detail in the trials to elucidate reasons for
loss (e.g. intrauterine death or spontaneous miscarriage), and this
would be important in future research.
Government and hospital policies affect how midwives are ’al-
lowed’ to practise, and/or the institutional structure within which
midwives practise, and would thus affect practices and outcomes
by limiting the potential of midwife-led continuity of care in some
settings. This is in contrast to models of health care which offer
relationship continuity over time, which have been found to pre-
vent clients falling through ’gaps in care’ (Cook 2000). Women’s
experiences of care reported in the original studies include ma-
ternal satisfaction with information, advice, explanation, venue of
delivery and preparation for labour and birth, as well as percep-
tions of choice for pain relief and evaluations of carers behaviour.
In the majority of the included studies, satisfaction with various
aspects of care appears to be higher in the midwife-led continuity
of care compared to the other models of care.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Although there were limitations in the way that satisfaction-re-
lated outcomes were assessed and reported, the majority of the
included studies showed a higher level of satisfaction with various
aspects of care in the midwife-led continuity of care compared to
23

 the other models of care. Estimates of cost and resource use em-
ployed different economic evaluation methods. Results generally
suggest a cost-saving effect in intrapartum care; one study suggests
a higher cost of postnatal care when midwife-led continuity of
care is compared with medical-led care. However, there is a lack of
consistency in estimating maternity care cost among the available
studies, and there seems to be a trend towards a cost-saving effect
of midwife-led continuity of care in comparison with medical-led
care.
Quality of the evidence
We assessed the quality of trial evidence for the following outcomes
usingthe GRADEmethodology:pretermbirth <37weeks, all fetal
loss before and after 24 weeks plus neonatal death, spontaneous
vaginal birth (as defined by trialists), caesarean birth, instrumental
vaginal birth,intactperineumandregional analgesia. All outcomes
were graded as of high quality. Multiple trials of low risk of bias
contributed to each outcome, and there were precise estimates
with no heterogeneity greater than 60%. No trial included in this
review had adequate blinding of participants, staff or outcomes
assessors. We did not downgrade trial evidence for risk of bias due
to lack of blinding. However, we understand that other authors
might choose to do so. We would not expect blinding to affect the
outcomes of preterm birth or fetal loss, but the argument could
be made that blinding matters for mode of birth, intact perineum
and use of analgesia.
Potential biases in the review process
We searched for further studies in the reference list of the studies
identified, and did not apply any language or date restrictions. We
made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk
of bias using the GRADE approach. We carried out sensitivity
analyses to explore the effect of trial quality assessed by conceal-
ment of allocation, high attrition rates, or both, with poor quality
studies being excluded from the analyses in order to assess whether
this made any difference to the overall result. No other potential
sources of bias were identified in any of the included studies. There
was no strong evidence of reporting bias, though this is difficult
to detect with the number of studies in this review, and whether it
exists and the extent to which it affects the results may be clarified
when more studies have been conducted.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Studies of qualitative data can add understanding on why women
experience fewer birth interventions within this model of care.
One meta-synthesis (Walsh 2012), suggests that lower rates of in-
terventions could be linked to the “greater agency experienced by
women and midwives within midwife-led models”, and that these
effects are mediated, in part, by the smallness of scale in these set-
tings. A review of reviews (Sutcliffe 2012), compared midwife-led
care during pregnancy and birth with physician-led care resulted
in similar findings to this review.

Implications for practice
Midwife-led continuity of care confers important benefits and
shows no adverse outcomes. However, due to the exclusion of
women with significant maternal disease and substance abuse from
some trials of women at mixed risk, caution should be exercised
in applying the findings of this review to women with substan-
tial medical or obstetric complications. Policy makers and health-
care providers should be aware that such benefits are conferred
when midwives provide intrapartum care in hospital settings and
also where midwives provide continuity through pregnancy and
childbirth. Not all areas of the world have health systems where
midwives are able to provide midwife-led continuity models of
care, and health system financing is a potential barrier to imple-
mentation. Policy makers who wish to achieve clinically impor-
tant improvements in maternity care, particularly around normal-
ising and humanising birth, and preventing preterm birth should
consider midwife-led continuity models of care and consider how
financing of midwife-led services can be reviewed to support this.
Implications for research
Questions remain about the best way to organise midwife-led con-
tinuity of care under varying conditions, and further comparisons
of different models of midwife-led continuity of care would be
helpful. Furtherresearch shouldexplore whetherthe observedben-
efits can be attributed to the model of continuity of midwifery
care, philosophy, or to the quality and degree of relationship be-
tween the care provider and women. Further research is needed on
more recently developed midwife-led continuity models of care
that include home birth and greater levels of relationship conti-
nuity in community settings to women classified at low and high
risk of complications. One such model that should be evaluated is
the community-based caseload model of midwife-led continuity
of care. These models offer continuity of carer, with a named mid-
wife working in partnership with associate midwives (usually two).
They provide community-based outreach and locally accessible
services, in association with other care providers as necessary, with
the option of intrapartum care provided at home, in a midwife-
led unit or in a hospital setting as appropriate. Others provide care
to socially vulnerable women with promising results but further
trials are required (Rayment-Jones 2015).

Midwife-led continuity models versus other models of care for childbearing women (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Little is known about the interface between midwife-led continu-
ity models of care and the multi-disciplinary network of support.
Although continuity of care has been identified as a core com-
ponent of a model of midwife-led care, there is wide variation in
the definition and measurement of continuity of care, which will
require greater sophistication in future studies. Future research
should also assess acceptability to midwives of different models of
midwife-led continuity of care that offer relational continuity.
Future trials in this area would benefit from drawing on a frame-
work for trials of complex interventions, which explicitly requires
theoretical modelling between processes and outcomes in the pre-
trial stage, and a process evaluation of the trial (Anderson 2008).
All trials should provide greater description of intervention and
standard models of care being assessed (Hoffman 2014) and in-
clude process evaluations of how they are being implemented
(Moore 2014), using reporting guidelines for complex interven-
tions. Future research in this area would benefit from exploring
the theoretical underpinnings of these complex interventions and
their associations with processes and outcomes and implementa-
tion reviews are helpful.
Questions remain about the mechanisms regarding why fetal loss
is reduced, and why there are fewer preterm births in midwife-led
continuity models of care.
There remainsrelativelylittle informationaboutthe effectsof mid-
wife-led continuity models of care on mothers’ and babies’ health
and well being in the longer postpartum period. Future research
should pay particular attention to outcomes that have been under-
researched, but are causes of significant morbidity, including post-
partum depression, urinary and faecal incontinence, duration of
caesarean incision pain, pain during intercourse, prolonged per-
ineal pain and birth injury (to the baby). We will add these to the
review outcomes when the review is updated as available, if not
already specified in this review.
There were no trials in resource-constrained countries and addi-
tional trials may be required in such settings.
Little is known about whether women feel they are part of the de-
cision-making process; sense of control; maternal self-confidence;
post-traumatic stress disorder, coping after the birth. There is wide
variation in the instruments used to measure women’s views of and
experiences of care. There is a need to develop meaningful, robust,
valid and reliable methods to assess psychosocial outcomes and
well being in pregnant and childbearing women. All trials should
include an assessment of maternal and fetal well being. There is a
lack of consistency in estimating maternity care cost, and further
research using standard approaches of cost estimation is required
which also includes cost to women and families. All trials should
include economic analyses of the relative costs and benefits.
Given the heterogeneity in the choice of outcome measures rou-
tinely collected and reported in randomised evaluations of mod-
els of maternity care, a core (minimum) data set, such as that by
Devane 2007, and a validated measure of maternal quality of life
and well being would be useful not only within multi-centre trials
and for comparisons between trials, but might also be a significant
step in facilitating useful meta-analyses of similar studies. In ad-
dition, future trials should include measures of optimal outcomes
for mothers and babies in addition to measures of morbidity.

Participants randomised: 1 midwife-led care, 0 to standard care.
Interventions
Experimental: women randomised to the intervention received antenatal, intrapartum
and postnatal care from a known midwife
Control: women randomised to the control group were able to select any other available
model of antenatal care including YWC, care with a GP
, or a community- or hospital-
based antenatal clinic

Begley 2011
Methods
Study design: RCT.
Duration of study: 2004-2007.
Participants
Setting: Health Service Executive, Dublin North-East, Republic of Ireland.
Inclusion criteria: women were eligible for trial entry if they were: (a) healthy with
an absence of risk factors for complications for labour and delivery as identified in the
‘Midwifery-led Unit(Integrated)Guidelines for Practitioners’ (athttp://www.nehb.ie/midu/
guidelines.htm); (b) aged between 16 and 40 years of age; and (c) within 24 completed
weeks of pregnancy.
Exclusion criteria: women with risk factors.
Participants randomised: 1101 midwife-led care, 552 to CLC.
Interventions
Experimental: women randomised to midwife-led care (MLU) received antenatal care
from midwives and, if desired, from their GPs for some visits. Where complications
arose, women were transferred to CLU based on agreed criteria. Intrapartum care was
provided by midwives in a MLU with transfer to CLU if necessary. Postnatal care was
by midwives in the MLU for up to 2 days, with transfer of women or neonates to CLU
if necessary (and back, as appropriate). On discharge, MLU midwives visited at home,
and/or provided telephone support, up to the seventh postpartum day
Control: women randomised to consultant-led care (CLU) received standard care: an-
tenatal care provided by obstetricians supported by the midwifery and medical team; in-
trapartum and postpartum care (2 to 3 days in hospital) provided by midwives, overseen
by consultants. Women were discharged into the care of Public Health Nurses

Methods
Study design: RCT.
Duration of study: 1996-1998.
Participants
Setting: public tertiary hospital, Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne, Australia.
Inclusion criteria: participants included women at low and high risk of complications.
Exclusion criteria: women who requested shared obstetric care, needed care in the
maternal-fetal medicine unit, were > 24 weeks’ gestation, did not speak English.
Participants randomised: 502 team midwifery, 498 to standard care.
Interventions
Experimental: team of 7 full-time midwives who provided antenatal, intrapartum, and
some postnatal care in hospital in consultation with medical staff. Doctors and team
midwife jointly saw women at 12-16, 28, 36, 41 weeks. Women at high risk of compli-
cations had individual care plans.
Control: various options of care including shared care between GPs in the community
and hospital obstetric staff, shared care between midwives in a community health centre
and hospital obstetric staff, care by hospital obstetric staff only, and less commonly, care
by hospital midwives in collaboration with obstetric staff. Women within these options
experienced a variable level of continuity of care during their pregnancy, from seeing the
same midwife or doctor at most visits to seeing several doctors and midwives

Methods
Study design: RCT, Zelen method.
Duration of study: 1997-1998.
Participants
Setting: public tertiary hospital and community, Sydney, Australia.
Inclusion criteria: women at low and high risk of complications.
Exclusion criteria: women more than 24 weeks’ gestation at their first visit to the
hospital, women with an obstetric history of 2 previous caesareans or a previous classical
caesarean and medical history of significant maternal disease.
Participants randomised: 640 team-midwife-led care, 643 to standard care (shared care)
Interventions
Experimental: 2 teams of 6 midwives sharing a caseload of 300 women a year/team. An-
tenatal care in outreach community-based clinics. Intrapartum and postpartum hospital
and community care. Obstetrician or obstetric registrar did not see women routinely,
but acted as a consultant and reviewed women only as necessary. Women who developed
complications during their pregnancy continued to receive care from the same group of
carers.
Control: standard care provided by hospital midwives and doctors in hospital-based
antenatal clinic, delivery suite and postnatal ward. Woman at high risk of complications
were seen by obstetrician or registrar. Low-risk women were seen by midwives and shared

Methods
Study design: RCT.
Duration of study: 2007-2010.
Participants
Setting: Royal Women’s Hospital (RWH), Melbourne, Australia.
Inclusion criteria: low-risk pregnant women; fewer than 24 completed weeks’ gestation;
a singleton pregnancy; and considered low obstetric risk at recruitment including an
uncomplicated obstetric history.
Exclusion criteria: previous caesarean section, history of stillbirth or neonatal death, 3
or more consecutive miscarriages, previous fetal death in utero, previous preterm birth (<
32 weeks), previous midtrimester loss/cervical incompetence/cone biopsy/known uterine
anomaly, previous early onset of pre-eclampsia (< 32 weeks’ gestation), or rhesus iso-
immunisation; complications during the current pregnancy (such as multiple pregnancy
or fetal abnormality); medical conditions (such as cardiac disease, essential hypertension,
renal disease, pre-existing diabetes, previous gestational diabetes, epilepsy, severe asthma,
substance use, significant psychiatric disorders and obesity [BMI > 35] or significantly
underweight [BMI < 17]).
Participants randomised: 1156 caseload, 1158 standard care.
Interventions
Experimental: majority of care from a ‘primary’ caseload midwife at the hospital. The
primary midwife collaborated with obstetricians and other health professionals and con-
tinued to provide caseload care if complications arose. Women saw an obstetrician at
booking, at 36 weeks’ gestation and postdates if required, and usually had 1 or 2 visits
with a ‘back-up’ midwife. Intrapartum care was provided in the hospital birthing suite.
Where possible, primary midwife was on call for the woman’s labour and birth. The
primary midwife (or a back-up) attended the hospital on most days to provide some
postnatal care and provided domiciliary care following discharge from hospital. Fulltime
midwives had a caseload of 45 women per annum. During the trial there were 7.5 (at
commencement) to 12 full-time equivalent midwives employed in caseload care, equat-
ing to 10-14 midwives
Control: options included midwifery-led care with varying levels of continuity, obstetric
trainee care and community-based care ‘shared’ between a general medical practitioner
(GP) and the hospital, where the GP provided the majority of antenatal care. In the
midwife and GP-led models women saw an obstetrician at booking, 36 weeks’ gestation
and postdates if required, with other referral or consultation as necessary. In all standard-
care options, women were cared for by whichever midwives and doctors were rostered
for duty when they came into the hospital for labour, birth and postnatal care

Tracy 2013
Methods
Study took place in 2 Australian centres (site 1: Royal Hospital for Women, Randwick;
and site 2: Mater Mother’s Hospital, Brisbane). The randomised trial compared caseload
midwifery with standard care. Women were recruited to the study from site 1 between
December 2008 and May 2011, and from site 2 between June 2010 and May 2011
Participants
Women were included if they were less than 24 weeks pregnant at the booking visit, and
aged 18 years and older. Women were excluded if they had planned to have an elective
caesarean section, had a multiple pregnancy, or were planning to book with another care
provider (e.g. a GP
, caseload midwife, or private obstetrician)
Interventions
Intervention: caseload midwifery care (receiving care through antenatal, intrapartum
and postpartum, in hospital and in the community) from a named caseload midwife
working in a small group of midwives known as a midwifery group practice (4 full-
time MWs). Each midwife provides care to 40 women a year as named midwife. The
named midwife was on call for labour and birth. The caseload midwives were backed up
when necessary by other caseload colleagues and by hospital staff during women’s stay
in the postnatal ward. Community postnatal care was provided for up to 6 weeks. An
obstetrician was allocated to each midwifery practice for consultation and referral using
national guidelines. Total number randomised to intervention: 871
Comparison: standard care, which involved shared antenatal care from a GP and hospital
midwives, labour and birth and postnatal hospital care from hospital midwives. It was
unclear whether community postnatal care was provided in standard care. Total number
randomised to standard care: 877
Data were collected at recruitment, at 36 weeks’ gestation and at 6 weeks and 6 months
postpartum
Outcomes
Primary outcomes:
Caesarean section (main PO), instrumental vaginal birth, unassisted vaginal birth, epidu-
ral analgesia, Apgar scores ≤ 7 at 5 minutes, admission to SCBU, preterm birth (GA <
37 weeks)
Secondary outcomes:
Antenatal admission to hospital; induction or augmentation of labour; perineal status
after birth; blood loss after birth; GAs and birthweights of the infants; breastfeeding
at hospital discharge, 6 weeks and 6 months postnatally; and perinatal and maternal
mortality, hospital cost by mode of birth (cost of birth per woman)
Notes
Forti 2015, additional report of Tracy 2013 identified from 2016 update. This reports
on a subset of publicly funded women randomised in the M@ngo trial (n = 420); women
receiving caseload midwifery care saw fewer midwives and health professionals during
their intrapartum care than did women in standard care. No additional data provided
1. Denominator = total randomised minus loss to follow-up, but including fetal loss
before 20 weeks. Intervention = 871 - 31 + 11 = 951; standard care = 877 - 50 + 14 =
841.
2. 19 (2%) women crossed over from caseload to standard care and 65 (7%) crossed

over from standard to caseload care.
3. 70%of participants were first time mothers.
4. The 2 groups were statistically different in terms of their BMI, which was judged
as clinically not significant by authors.
5. An interesting observation was an overall reduction in caesarean sections for both
groups from the pre-trial from 29% (at site 1) to 22% in the study population. This
decrease could be seen as a limitation of the trial and the result of the Hawthorn effect.
6. Participants’ satisfaction data and long-term cost analysis will be reported
elsewhere.
7. Cost calculation: the per-woman cost of care calculated includes both direct and
indirect costs for each full episode of maternity care, taking account of the length of
hospital stay for each woman. These were calculated for midwifery and obstetric
clinical time; use of operating theatres, laboratory tests, imaging, wards, allied health,
pharmacy; capital depreciation; and clinical overheads. Further comprehensive cost
analyses, including neonatal costs, will be reported elsewhere, as will the results of a
survey to assess the participants’ experiences and satisfaction with the different models
of care.
8. For the outcome of PPH, we have added together women who had between 500
and 1000 mL blood loss with those who had > 1000 mL.

Participants
Setting: Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital, Scotland, United Kingdom.
Inclusion criteria: women at low risk of complications.
Exclusion criteria: women booking after 16 weeks of pregnancy, not living in catchment
area or with medical/obstetric complications.
Participants randomised: 648 caseload, 651 standard care (shared care).
Interventions
Experimental: caseload midwifery provided by 20 midwives who volunteered to join
the MDU. Each pregnant woman had a named midwife whom she met at her first
booking visit who aimed to provide the majority of care. When the named midwife was
not available, care was provided by up to 3 associate midwives. Women were not seen
by medical staff at booking. Antenatal care was provided at home, community-based
clinics or hospital clinics. Intrapartum care was in hospital (MDU - 3 rooms with fewer
monitors and homely surroundings) or main labour suite. Postnatal care was provided
in designated 8-bed MDU ward and community. A medical visit was scheduled where
there was a deviation from normal.
Control: all women seen by medical staff at booking. Shared antenatal care with from
midwives, hospital doctors and GPs/family doctors. Intrapartum care from labour ward

 Characteristics of excluded studies [ordered by study ID]
Study
Reason for exclusion
Berglund 1998
This study was a retrospective study comparing outcomes for 2 groups of women who gave birth in 1990 and
1992
Berglund 2007
This study compared risk assessment by physicians with midwives reporting new mothers to the doctor. It does
not compare midwife-led with other models of care
Bernitz 2011
This study compared women giving birth in 3 different birth units: the special unit for high-risk women; the
normal unit; and the midwife-led unit. It does not compare midwife-led with other models of care throughout
pregnancy and birth
Chambliss 1991
Women admitted in labour were assigned to either midwife-led or a resident physician and antenatal care was
not part of the intervention
Chapman 1986
This study compares similar models of care occurring in 2 different birth environments rather than comparing
2 different models of care. The same group of community midwives cared for the women in both groups.
Method of randomisation is not stated
Famuyide 2014
This study did not provide continuity of care from antenatal through to intrapartum period
Giles 1992
The study compares 2 models of antenatal care, i.e. antenatal care by midwives and obstetricians or antenatal
care by midwives only. Intrapartum and postpartum care are not part of the intervention
Gu 2013
This study did not provide continuity of care from antenatal through to intrapartum period
Heins 1990
The study presents a randomised trial of nurse-midwifery prenatal care to reduce low birthweight: intrapartum
and postpartum care are not part of the intervention
Hildingsson 2003
The aim of the study was to determine women’s interest in home birth and in-hospital birth centre care in
Sweden and to describe the characteristics of these women. It did not compare the models of care in these 2
settings
Hundley 1994
The main objective was to compare care and delivery of low-risk women in a midwife-managed delivery unit
with care and delivery in the consultant-led labour ward. It is not indicated if women in the birth centre group
had antenatal midwifery-led care
James 1988
This study compared a schematic approach to antenatal care only and conventional shared care. There are no
data available
Kelly 1986
Study protocol only, search strategy did not reveal any evidence that the trial was conducted and completed
Klein 1984
The intervention involved the comparison of 2 birthing environments
Law 1999
In this study, the randomisation took place on the admission to labour ward, thus the study compared intra-
partum care only

 (Continued)
Marks 2003
This study aimed to compare continuity of midwifery care with standard midwifery care in reducing postnatal
depression in women with a past history of depression. Thus midwife-led care is not being compared to another
model of care
Runnerstrom 1969
The primary reason for exclusion is the fact that the study did not compare a midwifery model of care to another
model. The purpose of the investigation was to study the effectiveness or non-effectiveness of nurse-midwives
in a supervised hospital environment. The population of the study comprised student nurse-midwives and
compared their services to those of MD residents in the same unit. Moreover, there are not enough comparable
data
Slome 1976
Large loss to follow-up after randomisation. A total of 66.5% in the treatment group and 63.5% in the control
group were excluded or lost to the study
Stevens 1988
The care was not midwifery-led. Both groups received shared care. 1 group received most of their care at a
satellite clinic in their neighbourhood, which was an inner-city, socio-economically deprived area. The other
group received care at the hospital clinic. Women receiving satellite clinic care also had additional social support
from link workers during pregnancy. It was a comparison of the same model of care at different settings
Tucker 1996
The study compares a shared care model vs a medical-led model. The primary analyses are not included
Waldenstrom 1997
This study compared birth centre care - characterised by comprehensive antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum
care, on the same premises with a home-like environment and the same team of midwives - to the standard
obstetric care divided into antenatal care at neighbourhood antenatal clinics, intrapartum care in hospital
delivery wards, and postpartum care in hospital postpartum wards. In the standard obstetric care, a woman
usually meets with the same midwife, at the antenatal clinic, throughout pregnancy. In the delivery ward she
meets a new staff team, and in the hospital postpartum ward, yet another staff team. Thus, the study compares
continuous midwifery-led caseload model of care to team midwifery-led care
Walker 2012
This study compared care provided by general physicians, obstetric nurses and professional midwives in a
cluster-RCT in Mexico. It does not compare midwife-led with other models of care throughout pregnancy and
birth. Abstract only available

Appendix 1. Search methods used in previous versions of this review
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register by contacting the Trials Search Co-ordinator (January
2008).
The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register is maintained by the Trials Search Co-ordinator and contains trials
identified from:
1. quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);
2. weekly searches of MEDLINE;
3. handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences;
4. weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts.
Details of the search strategies for CENTRAL and MEDLINE, the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and
the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service can be found in the ‘Specialized Register’ section within the editorial
information about the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.
Trials identified through the searching activities described above are each assigned to a review topic (or topics). The Trials Search Co-
ordinator searches the register for each review using the topic list rather than keywords.
In addition, we searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group’s Trials Register (January 2008), Current
Contents (1994 to January 2008), CINAHL (1982 to August 2006), Web of Science, BIOSIS Previews, ISI Proceedings, (1990 to
2008), and the WHO Reproductive Health Library (WHO-RHL), No. 9. Through WHO-RHL we obtained unpublished studies
from the System for Information on Grey Literature In Europe (SIGLE). We used the search strategy detailed below, modifying it for
each database as appropriate by checking each thesaurus for relevant subject headings and replacing them with text-word search terms
when a subject heading was not available.
We did not apply any language restrictions.

Summary
Are you planning to include intrapartum foetal death rates for women delivering in different types of unit, and with different levels of
risk, as one of your outcome measures? We have been unable to find comparative data for a local review.
(Summary of comment from Sallie Bacon, May 2004)
Reply
We have not looked at intrapartum deaths specifically, but have addressed this issue in the ’Discussion’.

Summary
The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) is the longest established national organization for women’s
reproductive care in North America, with membership made up of obstetricians, gynaecologists, nurses, midwives, family physicians
and scientists. We have long supported a woman’s right to choose the care provider of her preference for obstetrical care, and we actively
support and promote collaborative models of care.
We were therefore very interested to read the review of midwifery-led care that you published in August of this year. We were not
surprised by the main findings cited in the abstract: less use of epidural or intra-partum analgesia, fewer instrumental deliveries and,
in consequence, fewer episiotomies, longer length of labour. These differences would be expected with the different model of care; for
some women an unmediated delivery is a goal. However, for others, access to analgesia is a key consideration; we cannot conclude from
this difference that the midwifery-led model is better for all women.
We were interested by the findings of fewer preterm births, fewer deaths <24weeks, findings which are unexplained, and for which it is
unlikely that we could identify an explanation based on who was providing the care, given that there are few, if any, clinical interventions
by any provider prior to 24 weeks which can affect these outcomes.
Beyond these matters, however, we are primarily contacting you because the abstract failed to list the important outcomes which do not
differ with provider: perineal trauma, induction of labour, oxytocin augmentation of labour, caesarean section, antenatal hospitalisation,
post-partum haemorrhage, length of hospital stay, initiation of breast feeding, neonatal Apgar score, admission to neonatal nursery,
fetal loss or death >24 weeks.
Our greatest concern is that, although the abstract failed to list or consider these fundamentally important clinical outcomes that were
equivalent, the authors still asserted that “most women should be offered midwifery-led continuity models of care and women should
be encouraged to ask for this option…”
We believe this conclusion received, and continues to receive, the bulk of media and lay attention. In fact, those who do not actually
read the review but only the abstract will come away with an incorrect understanding that is not supported by the results, an outcome
that appears to be self-serving and misleading.
We expect better from the Cochrane Collaboration. This was an opportunity to provide women with reassurance that they have
healthful options for their pregnancy care, and that they can feel confident that, regardless of their choice, the outcomes will be similar
with respect to a safe and healthy pregnancy and delivery. Instead, the way this issue has been positioned, and by the selective use
of the data, the Cochrane appears to advocate for a particular model of care, a disservice to women and the many other health care
professionals who care for them.
Comment received from Jennifer Blake, Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, November 2013.
Reply
We are pleased to see the SOGC’s interest in our review and thank them for their comments.
We agree that findings of fewer preterm births and fewer deaths less than 24weeks are interesting. Midwife-led continuity of care is
a complex intervention, and it is impossible to unpick the relative importance of philosophy and continuity of care. We note in our
review that questions remain about the mechanisms underlying these findings.
Our abstract is reported in original format in an effort to present information on multiple outcomes in as clear a manner as possible.
Further to your comments, in the updated review, we have reformatted the presentation of outcomes in the abstract such that all
primary outcomes are presented initially followed by all secondary outcomes. This will, we believe provide the reader with the totality
of information on which to inform their health care decisions. Similarly, we have revised the conclusion to summarise the findings of
the review and key areas for further research.
We trust this addresses your concerns.

New search has been performed
Search updated. Three new trial reports identified re-
lating to three studies already included in the review
(Begley 2011; McLachlan 2012; Tracy 2013). Addi-
tional data have been added from two of the new re-
ports on cost (Begley 2011) and maternal satisfaction

24 weeks as the cut-off for viability in many countries)”
was changed to “All fetal loss before and after 24 weeks
plus neonatal death.”
The secondary neonatal outcomes, “Fetal loss and
neonatal death less than 24 weeks” and “Fetal loss and
neonatal death equal to/after 24 weeks” were changed to
“Fetal loss less than 24 weeks and neonatal death” and
“Fetal loss equal to/after 24 weeks and neonatal death”

In this update the evidence now suggests that women
randomised to receive midwife-led continuity models
of care were less likely to experience preterm birth.
There is now no evidence of a difference between dif-
ferent models of care in terms of antenatal hospitali-
sation and breastfeeding initiation

In response to feedback, we have clarified what is
meant by midwife-led care and have stressed the multi-
disciplinary network of care providers; have added in-

caesarean section; and revised the Abstract’s conclu-
sions from “All women” to “Most women should be
offered midwife-led models of care and women should
be encouraged to ask for this option.”
