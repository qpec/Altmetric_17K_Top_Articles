With Chronic Noncancer Pain
Wayne A. Ray, PhD; Cecilia P. Chung, MD, MPH; Katherine T. Murray, MD; Kathi Hall, BS; C. Michael Stein, MB, ChB
IMPORTANCE Long-acting opioids increase the risk of unintentional overdose deaths but also
may increase mortality from cardiorespiratory and other causes.
OBJECTIVE To compare all-cause mortality for patients with chronic noncancer pain who
were prescribed either long-acting opioids or alternative medications for moderate to severe
chronic pain.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study between 1999 and 2012 of
Tennessee Medicaid patients with chronic noncancer pain and no evidence of palliative or
end-of-life care.
EXPOSURES Propensity score–matched new episodes of prescribed therapy for long-acting
opioids or either analgesic anticonvulsants or low-dose cyclic antidepressants (control
medications).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Total and cause-specific mortality as determined from
death certificates. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and risk differences (difference in incidence
of death) were calculated for long-acting opioid therapy vs control medication.
RESULTS There were 22 912 new episodes of prescribed therapy for both long-acting opioids
and control medications (mean [SD] age, 48 [11] years; 60% women). The long-acting opioid
group was followed up for a mean 176 days and had 185 deaths and the control treatment
group was followed up for a mean 128 days and had 87 deaths. The HR for total mortality was
1.64 (95% CI, 1.26-2.12) with a risk difference of 68.5 excess deaths (95% CI, 28.2-120.7) per
10 000 person-years. Increased risk was due to out-of-hospital deaths (154 long-acting
opioid, 60 control deaths; HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.40-2.58; risk difference, 67.1; 95% CI,
30.1-117.3) excess deaths per 10 000 person-years. For out-of-hospital deaths other than
unintentional overdose (120 long-acting opioid, 53 control deaths), the HR was 1.72 (95% CI,
1.24-2.39) with a risk difference of 47.4 excess deaths (95% CI, 15.7-91.4) per 10 000
person-years. The HR for cardiovascular deaths (79 long-acting opioid, 36 control deaths)
was 1.65 (95% CI, 1.10-2.46) with a risk difference of 28.9 excess deaths (95% CI, 4.6-65.3)
per 10 000 person-years. The HR during the first 30 days of therapy (53 long-acting opioid,
13 control deaths) was 4.16 (95% CI, 2.27-7.63) with a risk difference of 200 excess deaths
(95% CI, 80-420) per 10 000 person-years.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Prescription of long-acting opioids for chronic noncancer
pain, compared with anticonvulsants or cyclic antidepressants, was associated with a
significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality, including deaths from causes other than
overdose, with a modest absolute risk difference. These findings should be considered when
evaluating harms and benefits of treatment.

pain guidelines and recommended for patients with frequent

longed drug levels might increase toxicity. Their more fre-
quent use has been associated with an increase in deaths from
opioid overdose.1,3Thus, comparative studies of the safety of
long-acting opioids relative to other therapy for chronic non-
cancer pain are needed. Common alternative medications
for moderate to severe chronic pain include analgesic
anticonvulsants12,13 and low-dose cyclic antidepressants.14 Al-
thoughthesedrugsarethoughttoberelativelysafe,theydohave
potentially serious adverse effects.12,15 However, there are lim-
ited data from population-based studies about the compara-
tive safety of long-acting opioids.
This study compared the risk of death among patients
initiating long-acting opioid therapy for chronic noncancer
pain with that for matched patients initiating therapy with
either an analgesic anticonvulsant or a low-dose cyclic anti-
depressant. There were 3 questions. First, did total mortality
differ between the 2 groups? Second, what was the relative
risk of deaths outside the hospital, which are less likely to be
due to existing conditions and most plausibly related to opi-
oid adverse effects?16 Third, were there differences in the risk
of deaths other than those from unintentional medication
overdose?
Methods
Cohort
This retrospective cohort study included Tennessee Medicaid
enrollees initiating therapy with a study drug from 1999
through 2012. The Medicaid files provided an efficient source
of data for identifying the cohort, determining periods of
probable exposure to medications, and ascertaining
deaths.17,18 The Medicaid data included enrollment, phar-
macy, hospital, outpatient, and nursing home files, aug-
mented with linkage to death certificates17,19 and a statewide
hospital discharge database. The study was reviewed and
approved by the institutional review boards of Vanderbilt
University and the State of Tennessee Health Department,
which waived informed consent.
To improve study capacity to identify medication-
related deaths, thus reducing the potential for confounding,
the cohort was limited to patients without evidence of can-
cer, or palliative, or end-of-life care (eTables 1 and 2 in the
Supplement).20 Thus, the cohort excluded persons aged 75
years or older; patients with cancer, other life-threatening dis-
eases, or evidence of hospice or other terminal care; and nurs-
ing home residents. Hospitalized patients could not enter the
cohortuntil30daysafterdischarge,becausedeathsduringthis
period may have been related to the reasons for the hospital-
ization. Persons with recorded evidence of drug abuse were
excluded, given the increased risk of abuse-related medica-
tion overdose.
The cohort consisted of qualifying patients initiating
therapy21 with the study drugs who had a diagnosis of
chronic pain (back, other musculoskeletal, abdominal, head-
ache, other neurologic pain) in the past 90 days. The study
drugs were the long-acting opioids (sustained release [SR]
morphine, controlled release [CR] oxycodone, transdermal
fentanyl, and methadone). The control drugs were either
anticonvulsants indicated for chronic pain (gabapentin,
pregabalin, carbamazepine) or low-dose cyclic antidepres-
sants (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Patients had a new epi-
sode of therapy when they filled a study drug prescription
with no prior fill for a drug in that class for the previous year
(except for the past 30 days, permitting inclusion of persons
starting drug after hospitalization). They could not have had
a prescription filled in the prior year for any of the other
study drugs. Patients were excluded if the starting daily dose
(eTables 3-5 in the Supplement) was not recommended for
chronic pain (cyclic antidepressants >150-mg amitriptyline
equivalents) or was unusually high (long-acting opioids
>180-mg morphine equivalents,22 or anticonvulsants
>1800-mg gabapentin equivalents).
Matching
To reduce potential confounding, new episodes of therapy for
long-acting opioids were matched to new episodes of therapy
for the control drugs according to propensity score, the prob-
ability of long-acting opioid use, given the study covariates on
cohort entry. These were factors with a plausible direct or in-
direct relation to both study drug use and mortality (eTable 6
in the Supplement). The 122 covariates included demo-
graphic characteristics, diagnoses related to chronic pain, use
of short-acting opioids and other medications for pain, ben-
zodiazepines and other psychotropic medications linked with
risk of overdose death,23 psychiatric diagnoses, cardiovascu-
lar conditions, respiratory diseases, other illnesses, and medi-
cal care utilization.
Thefrequencymatchingwasperformedbydividingtheco-
hort into centiles (1%) according to the long-acting opioid pro-
pensityscoredistribution.Withineachcentile,onepatientpre-
scribedthecontroldrugwasrandomlyselectedforeverypatient

The random frequency matching increased the likelihood that
all matches were of equal quality and permitted an un-
matched analysis. The final cohort consisted of 1:1 frequency-
matched new episodes of therapy with the long-acting opi-
oids and the control drugs (eTable 6 in the Supplement).
Follow-up
Patients entered the cohort on the date of the filling of the first
study drug prescription. They left the cohort on the earliest

of completing 1 year without filling a study drug prescription,
filling a prescription for a drug in a different class (eg, when a
patients who had been prescribed a long-acting opioid or an
anticonvulsant started a cyclic antidepressant, regardless of
dose), dying, not meeting inclusion-exclusion criteria, or com-
ing to the end of the study. Patients who left the cohort could
reenter if they subsequently became eligible. Because the epi-
sodes were nonoverlapping and the end point occurred only
once, statistical independence assumptions were satisfied.24
Follow-up was further restricted to the dispensed days of
medication therapy included in each study prescription, the
time during which patients were most likely to be taking the
drug. This period was defined as the interval between the fill-
ing of the prescription and the earliest of the end of the days
of supply, filling of a subsequent prescription for a drug in the
same class, or end of study follow-up. Person-time from the
dayafterhospitaladmissionthroughthe30daysfollowingdis-
charge was not considered active medication therapy be-
cause in-hospital medication data were unavailable and post-
discharge medication changes could take up to 1 refill interval
to become known.
End Points
The end point was all deaths that occurred during the study
follow-up. Hospital death was defined as occurring if pa-
tientswereadmittedtothehospitalonadayduringwhichthey
had used one of the study drugs and died either while in the
hospital or within 30 days of admission. All other deaths were
consideredout-of-hospitaldeaths(includingpatientswhodied
in the emergency department) and were further classified as
unintentional medication overdose or other deaths. The lat-
ter included cardiovascular, respiratory, other injury, or other
deaths (eTable 7 in the Supplement). In 1 analysis, we exam-
inedcardiovascularmortalityforthesubgroupsdefinedbyspe-
cific cardiovascular diagnoses (eTable 8 in the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis compared the adjusted risk of death
during follow-up for patients in the long-acting opioid group
with those in the control medication group. Relative risk was
estimated with the hazard ratio (HR), calculated from Cox
regression models (Statistical Analysis section in the Supple-
ment). To adjust for residual confounding, regression models
were stratified according to deciles of the baseline propensity
score.25 The primary models included age, calendar year, and
study medication as time-dependent covariates, estimated
via a counting process formulation that accommodates non-
proportional hazards.26(p172) Other time-dependent covari-
ates were not included in the primary analysis because these
might be on the causal pathway for mortality (eg, nonfatal
injury). A sensitivity analysis included a time-dependent pro-
pensity score27 that accounted for changes in study covari-
ates during follow-up (Statistical Analysis section in the
Supplement).
The adjusted risk difference, or difference in the inci-
dence of death between patients in both groups, was esti-
mated. The risk difference was calculated as I0 × (HR −1), for
which HR is the adjusted HR and I0 the unadjusted incidence
for patients in the control medication group. The 95% CIs were
calculated analogously.
The analysis included a time-dependent analysis of the re-
lation of duration of study drug therapy and dose during
follow-up to total study mortality. Duration was defined as cu-
mulative dispensed days of therapy on the day a study drug
prescription was filled. Cut points for low (≤cut point) vs high
dose (>cut point) were the approximate median time-
dependent doses: 60-mg/d morphine equivalents, 600-
mg/d gabapentin equivalents, and 40-mg/d amitriptyline
equivalents. The regression analysis was stratified by 20 quan-
tiles of a time-dependent disease risk score (Statistical Analy-
sis section in the Supplement).28-30 The disease risk score, the
risk of death as a function of the study covariates estimated
forthereferenceexposurecategory,facilitatesanalysesformul-
tiple exposure categories, given that propensity scores are less
suited to nonbinary comparisons.28-30
Sensitivity analyses that assessed populations of particu-
larinterestortestedstudyassumptionswereperformed.These
included exclusion of patients prescribed methadone, restric-
tion of the cohort to patients with a diagnosis of neurologic
pain,useofcontrolgroupsconsistingexclusivelyofpropensity-
score matched anticonvulsant or cyclic antidepressant pa-
tients, exclusion of patients entering the cohort before 2003,
restriction of analysis to the first 180 days of therapy, exclu-
sion of deaths with unknown cause from the cardiovascular
death category, and expansion of the nonoverdose and car-
diovascular death categories to include hospital deaths.
The effect of cardiovascular death misclassification was
assessed (Sensitivity Analysis in the Supplement) by adjudi-
cation of a convenience sample of 50 deaths from a previous
study of long-acting opioids for which medical records had
been reviewed.16 The analysis made the conservative assump-
tion that control medication deaths were not misclassified.
All analyses were performed with SAS version 9.4 (SAS In-
stitute Inc). All P values were 2-sided, with a P value <.05 in-
dicating statistical significance.
Results
There were 23 308 new episodes of prescriptions for long-
acting opioids and 131 883 new episodes of prescriptions for
control medications (Table 1). These groups differed with re-
gard to baseline characteristics, with standardized differ-
ences exceeding 10% for most study covariates (Table 1). Af-
ter matching, the cohort included 22 912 long-acting opioid
episodes and an equal number of control medication epi-
sodes. The matched long-acting opioid and control medica-
tion groups were more comparable, with no standardized dif-
ference exceeding 3% and the majority less than 1%. The mean
(SD)ageofthematchedpatientswas48(11)yearsand60%were
women. The most common chronic pain diagnoses were back
pain (75%), other musculoskeletal pain (63%), and abdomi-
nal pain (18%). More than 96% of study patients had filled a
prescription for a short-acting opioid in the prior year, and 68%
had a current prescription for these drugs at the beginning of
follow-up.Patientsfrequentlyfilledprescriptionsforotherpain

nonoverdose deaths was cardiovascular deaths, with an HR of
1.65 (95% CI, 1.10-2.46) and a risk difference of 28.9 (95% CI,
4.6-65.3) per 10 000 person-years. Patients in the long-acting
opioid group had elevated cardiovascular mortality for all of
the subgroups defined by specific cardiovascular diagnoses,
with the exception of diabetes (eTable 8 in the Supplement).
The increased mortality for the long-acting opioid group
was limited to the first 180 days of prescribed therapy (Figure).
During the first 30 days of therapy, the HR was 4.16 (95% CI,
2.27-7.63) and the risk difference was 200 (95% CI, 80-420)
per 10 000 person-years; for the remainder of the first 180 days
the HR was 1.56 (95% CI, 1.05-2.30) and the risk difference was
74 (95% CI, 7-172) per 10 000 person-years. By contrast, once
patientsinthelong-actingopioidgrouphadmorethan180days
of therapy, their risk of death did not differ significantly from
that of the control drug group (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.67-1.57; risk
difference, 3; 95% CI, −37-65 per 10 000 person-years).
For both low and high doses of study drugs, total mortal-
ityforlong-actingopioidpatientswasgreaterthanthatforcom-
parable patients in the control medication group (Figure). For
low doses (≤60 mg of morphine or its equivalent) the HR was
1.54 (95% CI, 1.01-2.34) and the risk difference was 51 (95% CI,
1-126) per 10 000 person-years; for high doses (>60 mg mor-
phine or its equivalent) the HR was 1.94 (95% CI, 1.40-2.70)
andtheriskdifferencewas111(95%CI,47-200)per10 000per-
son-years. Similarly, patients in the long-acting opioid group
had greater mortality within categories defined by baseline
short-acting opioid doses of 30 mg or less or more than 30 mg
morphine equivalents.
Sensitivity analyses that assessed populations of particu-
lar interest or tested study assumptions were performed
(Table 4). In each case, findings were similar to those from the
primary analysis.
The medical records–based cardiovascular death misclas-
sification analysis (Sensitivity Analysis section in the Supple-
ment) found that 44% of total out-of-hospital deaths in the
convenience sample met the criteria for cardiovascular death,
slightly lower than the 46% based on the death certificate un-
derlying cause of death. This degree of misclassification would
decrease the observed HR for cardiovascular deaths from 1.65
(95% CI, 1.10-2.46) to 1.58 (95% CI, 1.05-2.36), although, de-
pendingonthespecificadjudicationcriteria,theHRcouldhave

Discussion
Although long-acting opioids increase the risk of uninten-
tional overdose,1-3,5 their overall safety relative to other
medications commonly prescribed to treat noncancer pain
has not been previously well quantified. This study found
that patients prescribed therapy for a long-acting opioid had
a risk of all-cause mortality that was 1.64 times greater than
that for matched patients starting an analgesic anticonvul-
sant or a low-dose cyclic antidepressant, corresponding to
69 excess deaths per 10 000 person-years of therapy. This
difference was explained by a 1.90 times greater risk of out-
of-hospital deaths. More than two-thirds of the excess
deaths were due to causes other than unintentional over-
dose; of these, more than one-half were cardiovascular
deaths. The increased risk was confined to the first 180 days
of prescribed therapy but was present for long-acting opioid
doses of 60 mg or less of morphine-equivalents.
The study was designed to reduce confounding by fac-
tors associated with starting a long-acting opioid. The cohort
excludedpatientswithevidenceofpalliativeorend-of-lifecare.
It was restricted to those initiating therapy with study medi-
cations, managing the bias inherent in study of those who sur-
vive a high-risk early exposure period.21 Patients in the 2 study
groups were tightly matched according to potential confound-
ers, including chronic pain diagnoses, patterns of prior use of
short-acting opioids and other analgesics, use of benzodiaz-
epines and other psychotropic drugs associated with in-
creased risk of overdose deaths,23 and cardiovascular, respi-
ratory, and other somatic comorbidity.
It is important to consider whether the elevated risk of
long-acting opioids is due to confounding by indication.
Long-acting opioids have been widely recommended for
chronic noncancer pain.11,22 Gabapentin and pregabalin are
indicated for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia,12,31,32 and
low-dose cyclic antidepressants for chronic back pain, neuro-
pathic pain, and fibromyalgia.14,32,33 In clinical practice all are
widely prescribed for chronic back and other musculoskel-
etal pain,13,14,32,34 by far the most common recorded diagno-
sis in the study cohort. Thus, material confounding by indi-
cation seems unlikely, a conclusion supported by the
essentially unchanged findings for control groups restricted
to patients with a diagnosis of neurologic pain or consisting
exclusively of patients prescribed either anticonvulsants or
cyclic antidepressants alone. Patients starting a long-acting
opioid may have had other unmeasured factors that
increased risk of death; however, the absence of increased
risk of the hospital deaths and the marked elevation in risk
early in therapy argue against such confounding.
The increased risk of long-acting opioids was not con-
fined to deaths identified as due to unintentional overdose.
Thus, of the estimated 69 excess deaths per 10 000 person-
years of follow-up among long-acting opioid patients, 47 had
an underlying cause of death other than unintentional over-
dose and 29 had a cardiovascular cause of death. The in-
creased risk of cardiovascular death persisted when patients
prescribed methadone, a known proarrhythmic drug,16 were
excluded from the cohort.
The increased risk of cardiovascular death could be
related to adverse respiratory effects of long-acting opioids.

An individual patient can be in multiple duration and dose categories during
follow-up; thus, the numbers do not sum to the total cohort size. Adjusted
hazard ratios and risk differences are shown for current use of long-acting
opioids vs current use of analgesic anticonvulsants or cyclic antidepressants.
The estimates according to duration of use and study drug dose during
follow-up are adjusted for a time-dependent disease risk score; those for
baseline use of short-acting opioids are adjusted for baseline propensity score
and age and calendar year during follow-up. Cut points for low (�cut point) vs
high (>cut point) study drug dose were 60-mg/d morphine equivalents,
600-mg/d gabapentin equivalents, and 40-mg/d amitriptyline equivalents. For
short-acting opioids, doses are in morphine equivalents.

including both obstructive and central sleep apnea.35-37
Patients with sleep-disordered breathing have increased inci-
dence of nocturnal arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia or
infarction, and sudden death.7 Study findings are consistent
with those of Solomon and colleagues,38 who found that
older adults with arthritis prescribed opioids (predominantly
short-acting) had nearly twice the risk of out-of-hospital car-
diac death as did comparable patients prescribed nonselec-
tive NSAIDs.
A study limitation was reliance on the death certificate to
classify the cause of death, thus raising the possibility that the
cardiovascular death finding was due to misclassification. A
sensitivity analysis based on a convenience sample of deaths
for which medical records were reviewed provided evidence
that misclassification was unlikely to explain the elevated car-
diovascular death risk, although under a worst-case scenario
the cardiovascular death HR was no longer statistically sig-
nificant. The convenience sample analysis had several other
limitations (Sensitivity Analysis section in the Supplement).
Furthermore, more than two-thirds of the excess deaths for
patientsinthelong-actingopioidgroupwerenotcodedasbeing
due to unintentional overdose. If there is this degree of mis-
classification,thenpreviousresearchonopioidmortality,most
of which has focused on overdose deaths identified from death
certificates,2,3,5hassubstantiallyunderestimatedthetruerisks
of opioids.
The study cohort differed from other populations of pa-
tients taking long-acting opioids. To improve study capacity
todetectadverseeffectsoflong-actingopioids,thecohortcon-
sisted of patients for whom illness-related deaths should be
relatively infrequent. Thus, it excluded persons 75 years or
older; patients with cancer; other life-threatening diseases, or
evidence of palliative or end-of-life care; and nursing home
residents. These restrictions were likely to reduce study co-
hortmortalitybecausetheexcludedpatientswouldhavehigher
baseline risk and could be more susceptible to adverse medi-
cation effects. The cohort also excluded patients with any re-
corded evidence of drug abuse, thus underestimating the po-
tential for overdose. Conversely, the cohort consisted of
Medicaid enrollees, who are likely to have had greater mor-
tality than the population at large.39
The study findings reinforce the conclusion of the recent
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’
s (CDC’
s) guide-
line for prescribing opioids for chronic noncancer pain that
“of primary importance, nonopioid therapy is preferred for
treatment of chronic pain.”20 Although this study did not
consider medication efficacy, the CDC’
s synthesis of the
available evidence suggests the efficacy of nonopioid phar-
macotherapy for many chronic conditions is at least equal to
that of opioids. The study finding that prescription of long-
acting opioids was associated with increased cardiovascular
and other nonoverdose mortality adds to the already consid-
erable known harms of the opioids and thus should be con-
sidered when assessing the benefits and harms of medica-
tions for chronic pain. Nevertheless, for some individual
patients, the therapeutic benefits from long-acting opioid
therapy may outweigh the modest increase in mortality risk.
As the CDC guideline indicates, all prescribing decisions must
be based on an evaluation of the source and severity of the
patient’
s pain and a discussion of the “known risks and real-
istic benefits of opioid therapy.
”20
Conclusions
Prescription of long-acting opioids for chronic noncancer
pain, compared with anticonvulsants or cyclic antidepres-
sants, was associated with a significantly increased risk of
all-cause mortality, including deaths from causes other than
overdose, with a modest absolute risk difference. These
findings should be considered when evaluating harms and
benefits of treatment.
