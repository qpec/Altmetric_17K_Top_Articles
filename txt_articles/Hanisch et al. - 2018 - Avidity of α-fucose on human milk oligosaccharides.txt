There is agreement with respect to norovirus infection routes
in humans regarding binding of the pathogen to gastrointestinal
epithelia via recognition of blood group–active mucin-type
O-glycans as the initiating and essential event. Among food
additives playing a potential role in applications to protect new-
borns, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) as competitors are
of major importance. By focusing on fractions of high-molecular
mass HMOs with high fucose contents, we attempted to identify
the structural elements required for norovirus GII.4 (Sydney
2012, JX459908) capsid binding in neoglycolipid-based arrays.
We provide evidence that HMO fractions with the strongest
binding capacities contained hepta- to decasaccharides express-
ing branches with terminal blood group H1 or Lewis-b antigen.
H2 antigen, as recognized by UEA-I lectin, is apparently not
expressed in high-mass HMOs. Beyond affinity, sterical and
valency effects contribute more to virus-like particle binding, as
revealed for oligovalent fucose conjugates of �-cyclodextrin and
oligofucoses from fucoidan. Accordingly, high-mass HMOs
with oligovalent fucose can exhibit stronger binding capacities
compared with monovalent fucose HMOs. The above features
were revealed for the most clinically relevant and prevalent
GII.4 strain and are distinct from other strains, like GII.10
(Vietnam 026, AF504671), which showed a preference for
blood group Lewis-a positive glycans.
Norovirus infections belong to the most common causes of
human gastroenteritis worldwide, and epidemic outbreaks
are responsible for hundreds of thousands deaths annually,
mainly among children under the age of 3 years. Data from the
NoroNet network indicate that increased activities of the virus
during November and December of 2012 were related to the
development of a novel, highly virulent genotype II.4 variant, first
reported in Australia (Sydney 2012, JX459908) (1) and currently
the most prevalent strain.
Noroviruses, a genus in the Caliciviridae family, are small
nonenveloped viruses that contain a single-stranded RNA
genome surrounded by a capsid protein. The capsid is formed
by assembly of 180 copies of the major capsid protein, VP1, and
a low copy number of the minor capsid protein, VP2 (2). Based
on variations within the VP1 gene, noroviruses are classified
into seven genogroups, termed GI–VII (3). The GII norovirus
strains are responsible for most infections in humans (4). To
establish an infection, the virus needs to bind to the gastroin-
testinal epithelia, and this binding is at least partly mediated by
specific interactions of a lectin-like activity in the norovirus
capsid and blood group–active mucin-type O-glycans on mem-
brane glycoproteins or mucins (5, 6). Evidence is accumulating
that fucose, a structural part of histo-blood group antigens
(HBGAs)2 or Lewis-like antigens, plays a major role in recogni-
tion of the protruding domain of the VP1 capsid protein of GII
norovirus strains, including the highly infectious GII.4 and the
recently emerged GII.17 noroviruses. ABH and Lewis fucoses of
blood group antigens are introduced by the FUT2 and FUT3
fucosyltransferases, and homozygously recessive individuals
lacking these enzymes were less susceptible or even resistant to
an infection by certain strains in human challenge and outbreak
studies (7, 8). Certainly, similar to the recently identified cellu-
lar protein receptor for murine noroviruses, there might be
other host factors required for attachment and entry of human
noroviruses (9).
One of the strategies to combat the virus by preventing its
binding to epithelial surfaces is based on food additives, like
human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), that mimic the struc-
ture of blood group–active mucin-type O-glycans. Human milk
oligosaccharides represent an ideal source of potential compet-
itors of viral glycan receptors, and although many of their struc-

 tural details were elucidated, knowledge regarding their precise
structure of high-mass HMOs is limited. One of the smaller but
strongly expressed HMOs in the milk of secretors, the trisac-
charide 2-fucosyllactose (2�FL), has gained attention, as it is
able to block norovirus binding quite efficiently (10, 11).
Although 2�FL has reached market approval as a safe food addi-
tive, the question remains whether other more complex glycans
in the fraction of high-mass HMOs might contain components
with higher competitive activity in norovirus binding and
whether these glycans might give clues to the fine structural
requirements of norovirus binding to host epithelia.
Based on these considerations, we have developed a neogly-
colipid-array strategy that allowed us to screen complex frac-
tions for components with high-binding capacity. These HMO
fractions were characterized after HPLC separation of compo-
nents by mass spectrometric analysis of their structures. Inde-
pendent of this approach, we followed a second route of con-
siderations, as it became evident that some of the observed
effects exerted by HMOs were induced by epitope valency
and were unrelated to blood group structures. In this con-
text, we generated a series of �-cyclodextrin dendrimers pre-
senting �-fucosyl residues at varying degrees of scaffold sub-
stitution and revealed stereochemical/valency-dependent
enhancement of competitive activity in norovirus-binding
assays. These findings with synthetic compounds were
finally supported by binding and inhibition studies with nat-
ural compounds, poly- and oligo-fucoses, corresponding to
native and fragmented fucoidan.

Screening of HMO neoglycolipid arrays reveals preference of
norovirus GII.4 binding to blood group H1 on high-mass
glycans
Fractions of HMOs, each containing about 5–20 different
high-mass glycans with different degrees of fucosylation, were
included in an in-house prepared neoglycolipid array. In addi-
tion to these HMO fractions, a series of commercially available
standard HMOs sizing up to hexasaccharides were included
in the array. Strong binding activity of norovirus GII.4 VLPs
was revealed for three HMO fractions (fractions 2, 7, and 46),
whereas seven other fractions showed intermediate or weak
VLP binding, and 32 HMO fractions were negative (Fig.
1A). Among the standard HMO compounds, LNFP-I and
LNneoFP-I with monovalent blood group H1- and H2-tri-
saccharide at the nonreducing termini were strongly active
(Fig. 1B). Smaller HMOs in the trisaccharide and tetrasaccha-
ride range were inactive (2�FL, 3FL, difuco-lactotetraose, data
not shown), probably due to sterical effects preventing access
of the bulky VLPs to the lipid-embedded neoglycolipids.
Also, all tested sialylated neoglycolipids covering the tri- to
pentasaccharides 3-sialyllactose, 3-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine,
and sialyllacto-N-tetraose c were inactive (data not shown).
In conclusion, GII.4 (Sydney, 2012, JX459908) VLPs bind
with high efficiency to blood group H–positive HMOs, with-
out discriminating between H1 and H2 antigens on LNFP-I
and LNneoFP-I, respectively.

HMO fractions, we tested the neoglycolipid array and standard
HMOs with the H2-specific lectin UEA-I for binding (Fig. 2A).
Although LNneoFP-I (H2-active) stained strongly positive with
the lectin, neither LNFP-I (H1-active) nor any of the VLP bind-
ing-positive or -negative HMO fractions were stained by the
lectin (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2). Accordingly, the VLP-binding com-
ponents in high-mass HMO fractions apparently express blood
group H1.
Similarly, a panel of VLP-binding HMO fractions and stan-
dard HMOs was tested for their relative activities of the blood
group H1-related Lewis-b antigen (Fig. 2B). Fractions 2, 7, and

 46 with high VLP-binding capacities were found to express high
levels of Lewis-b antigen, which is in accord with the assump-
tion that in particular type 1-based blood groups H1 and Lew-
is-b are responsible for the high binding capacities in high-
mass HMO fractions. However, also a series of negative VLP-
binding fractions was tested positive for Lewis-b epitopes. A
potential explanation could be the partial cross-reactivity of
the antibody with Lewis-a, as revealed for the neoglycolipid
of LNFP-II (Fig. 2B).
VLP-binding activity and fucose contents of HMOs
Valency of active glycotopes and hence the stereochemistry
of their presentation to VLPs are as expected important deter-
minants for the strength of binding. Accordingly, among high-
mass glycans with branched structures, we can expect species
with higher numbers of fucose and higher VLP-binding activity.
Mass spectrometric profiling of selected HMO fractions (Table
1) revealed 24 distinct species based on compositions of
monosaccharides. Some of these compositional species defined
by their M � Na� masses were found in only one HMO fraction
(see trifucosylated species in fraction 49), although others were
present in several fractions. Of particular interest are those
HMO fractions containing species with high numbers of
fucose residues (fractions 7, 46, and 49), as these may support
the hypothetical relation between VLP-binding activity and
degree of fucosylation. Fraction 49, containing glycans with up
to three fucose residues, exhibited low VLP-binding activity,
most likely because the structure of the dominant undecasac-
charide (refer to MS/MS fragmentation data given in Fig. S3)
revealed no H-type but Lewis-a fucosylation. Fractions 7 and 46
contain high proportions of species with up to five and four
fucose residues, respectively, and showed strong VLP-binding

 activity. Also fraction 2 exhibiting strong VLP-binding activity
contains glycans with up to two fucose residues. In summary,
these findings may support a relation of fucose content in HMO
species and their VLP-binding capacities. However, valency
effects cannot be clearly discriminated from contributions by
structural specificity.
In support of the hypothesis that valency effects might be
important in norovirus capsid binding, 2�FL and LNFP-I, which
both carry monovalent fucose, exhibited equally low activity in
VLP-binding inhibition assays (Fig. 3). The IC50 values of both
HMOs were above 30 mM. Accordingly, a blood group H1-ac-
tive HMO, the assumed specific target of the viral lectin,
appears to have a similar low affinity in binding competition on
gastric mucins as the reference HMO 2�FL.
Structural analysis of HMO fractions with high VLP-binding
activity
Oligosaccharides in HMO fraction 46 were separated by
reversed-phase chromatography on graphitized carbon, and
HPLC subfractions 1–12 were tested after conversion into
neoglycolipids for GII.4 VLP-binding capacities (Fig. 4A). Sub-
fraction HPLC-7, as the fraction with the highest VLP-binding
activity, was chosen for further analysis of glycan components.
Four dominant glycan species were revealed by MALDI-MS
profiling of oligosaccharides as the major components (Fig. 4B).
The molecular ions registered at m/z 1241, 1387, 1533, and
1679 indicated the presence of mono- to tetrafucosylated hex-
asaccharide cores of the composition F1H4N2, F2H4N2,
F3H4N2, and F4H4N2, respectively (Fig. 4B). The correspond-
ing permethylated glycans registered at m/z 1550, 1724, 1898,
and 2072, respectively, were analyzed in the post-source decay
mode to obtain fragmentation spectra and sequence informa-
tion (Fig. 4B). According to these MALDI-MS/MS spectra, the
trifucosylated nonasaccharide at m/z 1898 exhibits two nonre-
ducing termini branching at the galactose of the lactose core, as
indicated by the sodium adducts of primary fragment ions B3
(m/z 660.3), B4 (m/z 834.4), Y2� (m/z 1086.5), Y2� (m/z 1260.6),
Z4� (m/z 1487.7), and Z5� (m/z 1691.8).
These structural features of components in subfraction
HPLC-7 are reflected in the patterns of partially methylated
alditol acetates identified by GC-MS in HMO-46 (Fig. 5).
The glycans in this fraction contain a 3,6-disubstituted
galactose (3,6-Gal) and 3,4-disubstituted N-acetylgluco-
samine as the major hexose and hexosamine derivatives indi-
cating the presence of a backbone branch at the lactosyl core
and Lewis-type structures in the two branches. A minor pro-
portion of the branches terminates with a galactose, and less
than about 30% of the branches yields 4-monosubstituted
GlcNAc, which indicates the presence of H-type structures.
Lewis-b and H-type 1 active glycans on human gastric mucins
are preferred ligands for GII.4 VLP binding
Mucins isolated from human gastric juice express preferen-
tially O-linked glycans with blood group ABH and Lewis-type
structures (12). Testing GII.4 VLPs for their binding to mucins
from blood group Lewis-defined individuals revealed strong
activity on Lewis-b and Lewis-(�)/H1 mucins, but only weak
binding to Lewis-a mucins (Fig. 6A). This binding pattern
contrasts with that observed for GII.10 VLPs, which did not
discriminate between mucins from Lewis-a and Lewis-b
individuals (Fig. 6B). The finding is in agreement with data
from neoglycolipid arrays, where GII.10 VLPs bound most
strongly to Lewis-a active, branched HMOs,3 whereas GII.4
VLPs did not bind to LNFP-II exposing the Lewis-a trisac-
charide (Fig. 1B).
Arrays of neoglycoproteins revealed binding of GII.4 VLPs to
blood group A and B trisaccharides, weaker binding to H-disac-
charide, and no binding to sialylated Lewis epitopes (sLe-a and

 norovirus-to-mucin–binding assays (Fig. 7A). Not only the
native fucoidan from Fucus vesiculosus but also a solvolytically
desulfated and partially fragmented fucoidan were strongly
inhibitory in GII.4 VLP-binding assays on human gastric
mucins. These findings strongly indicate that the observed
competitive effect is independent of sulfation of the polyfucose.
Fucus species have their central chains composed of repeating
(133)- and (134)- linked �-L-fucopyranose residues, and
some minor amounts of �-L-fucopyranose are (1–2)-linked to
fucoses of the core chains (Fig. 7B) (13). The fragment sizes
ranged up to dp 20–25 (Fig. 7C). The structural aspects of
fucoidan are unrelated to the blood group H antigen, because
�-L-fucose is linked (1–2) to L-configurated 6-deoxygalactose
(L-fucose) instead of its D-stereoisomer.
Based on observations with fucoidan, we asked the question
whether a mere clustering of �-fucosyl residues on sugar-type
scaffolds, like �-cyclodextrin, could increase inhibitory activity
of free �-fucose, which exhibits IC50 values in the range of
60–80 mM. A further reference of a monovalent sugar with
norovirus binding inhibitory capacity, 2�FL, blocks GII.4 VLPs
with IC50 values more than 30 mM (see above). We tested den-
drimers of �-fucose substituted at varying degrees to �-cyclo-
dextrin: FCD1, FCD2, and FCD3 (Fig. 8). Whereas the low-
substituted FCD1 with less than one fucose per molecule was of
weak activity in VLP-binding competition, the FCD2 prepara-
tion with two fucosyl residues per molecule, on the average,
showed increased activity with IC values in the range of 20–30
mM. Strongest effects were seen for the FCD3 with three fucose
residues per molecule, and IC50 values of about 4 mM. The
structural features of the fucose dendrimers were revealed by
MALDI-MS (profile of substitution isomers, Fig. 9A), 1H NMR
(anomery of fucose, Fig. S1), and GC-MS linkage analysis

Discussion
Numerous studies have addressed the blood group depen-
dence of norovirus binding to human gastrointestinal epithelia
as an infectivity factor (5). X-ray crystallography studies of the
GII noroviruses revealed that there is a major contribution of
terminal �-fucose to a functional epitope (14), whereas other
parts of the glycan are much less involved. These additional
interactions can be quite complex, and evidence from X-ray
crystallography suggests that adaptive movements of both the
capsid loop and the HBGA glycan can account for these.
Whereas fucose in a blood group H2 trisaccharide is held by six
direct hydrogen bonds, the central galactose forms only two
and the subterminal GlcNAc just one direct hydrogen bond
with the capsid protein. There is also evidence that the H2- and
H1-trisaccharides in the P2 pocket are oriented similarly and
exhibit similar numbers of direct interaction with the protein.
Only a few other reports have dealt with these aspects of fine
specificity referring to the contributions of subterminal sugars
(see below). On the other side, epitope valency and epitope
presentation in clusters have come into the research focus, in
particular with respect to low- or medium-affinity interactions
of glycans with lectin-like proteins, as revealed for norovirus P2
domains. The latter represents an important aspect when ori-
entational constraints imposed on membrane glycoproteins or
glycolipids are considered. For these reasons, we chose a
screening strategy based on neoglycolipids that are immobi-
lized by embedding their nonpolar tails in a lipid layer on poly-

In contrast to X-ray crystallography studies, recently pub-
lished Saturation-Transfer Difference NMR in-solution exper-
iments showed strong contributions also of the sugars at the
reducing end (15). Itwasdemonstratedthatlinkageofthesubter-
minal galactose to GlcNAc is an important structural determinant
foreffectivebinding,anddifferentfromtype1bloodgroupchains,
type 2 structures yield very poor saturation transfer (15). Another
study referred to glycosphingolipids derived from small intestinal
epithelium of humans (type 1 chains) and dogs (type 2 chains) and
revealedstrongGII.4capsidbindingtoalltype1chains,butlowor
no binding to type 2 chains (16). Similarly, Shirato et al. (17) found
more tight binding of GII.4 (1997, Narita104, AB078336) to type 1
HBGAs than to type 2 HBGAs.
However, all the above studies have used GII.4 strains that
are less prevalent (16, 17), but in this study we examined a GII.4
(Sydney 2012) that is still a major strain and has been responsi-
ble for the most outbreaks worldwide since around 2012 (1).
The GII.4 variants have dominated over the past decade and
have caused four pandemics. Although the ABH-fucose–
binding amino acid residues in the P2 subdomain are typically
conserved among GII.4 variants, the residues surrounding the
pocket are more diverse. These mutations generate virus vari-
ants that might escape the host immune response. At the same
time, these variants may alter the interactions with subterminal
sugar units and create specific preferences to a certain glycan
conformation. In agreement with the previous studies (15, 16),
GII.4 (Sydney 2012) VLPs displayed strong binding to H-type 1
and Leb structures in high-mass HMOs, however, in contrast to
the previous studies without discriminating between blood

4-Glc in the ion trace at m/z 118 indicates that at least one-third of the available sites on the cyclodextrin scaffold is substituted with fucose. Minor or trace

 groups H1 and H2 on the standard lacto-N-fucopentaoses
LNFP-I and LNneoFP-I. Lewis-a–positive glycans on gastric
mucins are only weakly recognized by GII.4 (Sydney 2012),
whereas the rarely detected GII.10 Vietnam026 showed similar
binding to both Lea and Leb mucins.
Implications of the specificity toward H-type 1 and Leb for the
infectivity
Interestingly, this pattern is not only limited to noroviruses.
Other enteropathogens that utilize HBGAs as attachment
factors exhibit similar specificity. For instance, the dominant
rotavirus strains P[4] and P[8] also preferentially recognize
H-type 1 and Leb structures, whereas the less prevalent P[19]
rotavirus interacts with A, B, and H-type 1 HBGAs but not
those containing the Lewis epitope (18). Similarly, the bac-
terial pathogen Helicobacter pylori recognizes H-type 1 and
Leb HBGAs (19–21).
H-type 1 and Leb HBGAs as found in gastrointestinal epithe-
lia and secretions are products of the Secretor (FUT2) and
Lewis (FUT3) genes. These genes are active in 80 and 90% of the
general population, respectively. Accordingly, type 1 carbohy-
drates are highly abundant as glycan epitopes in the gastroin-
testinal tract of most individuals. Thus, high availabilities of the
H-type 1 and Leb in the gastric epithelium of the general pop-
ulation might serve as a selection factor and define infectivity of
many gastrointestinal microbes.
Does the length and branching of the carbohydrate chain
matter for the binding of free HMOs?
The norovirus binding to HBGAs is likely dependent on the
proper orientation of ABH and Lewis fucose. However, it is not
clear whether this can play a role when HBGA/HMOs are pres-
ent as free oligosaccharides. Because of the limited availabilities
of HMOs, most studies so far have used HMOs conjugated to
lipid or protein carriers. Only a few have tested HMOs as free
oligosaccharides (2�FL and 3FL, or LNFP-I in this study).
Based on surface plasmon resonance studies, there is not
much difference between type 1 and type 2 core elements,
when looking at binding of GII.17 capsids.4 Most likely, the
degree of fucosylation of HMOs or other antivirals and their
proper stereochemical presentation with respect to occu-
pancy of multiple HBGA-binding sites per virion are more
important for effective inhibition.
Fucose multivalency as an approach for norovirus drug design
The conservation of the HBGA-binding site and its depen-
dence on fucose recognition can serve as a starting point for
development of anti-entry antivirals against noroviruses. Our
recent work has identified two HMOs, 2�FL and 3FL, as possible
broadly reactive antivirals. However, HMOs and other analogs
of HBGA receptors bearing a single fucose unit are assumed
to be less efficient in competing with multivalent virus–
membrane glycan receptor interactions. Therefore, these sin-
gle-fucose inhibitors have to be administered at higher doses.
Alternatively, one can explore multivalent fucose analogs. For
instance, Rademacher et al. (22) generated high-avidity norovi-
rus binders by the attachment of a fucose-bearing compound to
a polymer scaffold (polyacrylamide). In our approach, fucoses
in fucosyl-cyclodextrins were attached to sugar-type scaffolds.
Thus, they are potentially more safe and still of high potency. As
an alternative to synthetic compounds, like fucosyl-cyclodex-
trins, natural products could be evaluated as antiviral food addi-
tives, like polyfucoses or fucans. Among the latter we explored
the potential of native F-fucoidan from F. vesiculosus, desul-
fated F-fucoidan, and oligofucoses derived from the brown algal
polysaccharide
by
partial
acid
hydrolysis
or
solvolysis.
Although these oligo-L-�-fucoses in the size range 2–20 dp do
not exhibit any structural relationship to blood group glycans,
they revealed strong inhibitory potentials in norovirus binding
inhibition on human gastric mucins.
Experimental procedures
Materials and methods
HMO fractions containing high-mass glycans were pro-
vided by Prof. Clemens Kunz. Other milk oligosaccharides
were either commercial products (LNT, LNFP-I, and LNFP-
II, Biocarb, Lund, Sweden; 2�FL, 3FL, and LNneoFP-I, Elici-
tyl, Crolles, France).
Production of norovirus VLPs
Two different strains of the genogroup GII were included in
this study: GII.4 (Sydney, 2012, JX459908) and GII.10 (Vietnam
026, AF504671). VP1 protein was recombinantly expressed in
insect Sf9 cells as described previously (23). Briefly, Sf9 cells
were transfected with recombinant VP1 bacmids using Effect-
ene. The cells were incubated at 26 °
C and harvested 6 days
postinfection. The baculovirus harvest was clarified by low-
speed centrifugation and was used to infect Tn5 cells at 26 °
C.
The cells were then harvested 6 days postinfection. The VLPs
were concentrated by ultra-centrifugation and then purified by
CsCl equilibrium gradient ultracentrifugation. The VLP band
was collected from the side of the tube, and the VLP morphol-
ogy was examined using EM.
Synthesis of �-fucosyl–�-cyclodextrin dendrimers
A variable molar excess of L-fucose over �-cyclodextrin was
solubilized in 0.12 weight % H2SO4 and incubated for 1 h at
110 °
C to achieve variable substitution of the cyclic glucose
scaffold with fucose by acid reversion chemistry. The products
were separated from the bulk of fucose by carbograph solid–
phase extraction (150-mg cartridges, Extract Clean, Grace
Davison Discovery Sciences, Lokeren, Belgium). Formation of
preferential �-glycosidic fucose bonds to the C6 of glucose was
confirmed by 1H NMR and GC-MS linkage analysis, respec-
tively. The degree of fucose substitution on �-cyclodextrin was
analyzed by MALDI-MS. Three distinct preparations could be
obtained with less than one (FCD1), two (FCD2), and three
(FCD3) fucose residues per cyclodextrin on average. A method
description for one- and two-dimensional 1H NMR TOCSY
spectrum of FCD3 is given in Fig. S1.

 fragmentation, the native sulfated F-fucoidan (30 mg) was pro-
tonated by treatment with Dowex 50WX8(H�) cation-ex-
change resin and afterward neutralized with pyridine. The pyr-
idinium salt was dried by vacuum rotation and incubated for
further drying in the presence of phosphorous pentoxide over-
night at 60 °
C in vacuo. The extensively dried pyridinium salt of
the polysaccharide was then treated at 100 °
C with 5 ml of a
mixture of DMSO/ pyridine (5:12, v/v) for 9 h. The solvolysis
product was dialyzed with several changes against water and
dried by vacuum rotation.
Preparation of neoglycolipid arrays
Neoglycolipids were prepared from reducing oligosaccha-
rides as described previously (24) with minor modifications.
In brief, HMOs (20 �g) were taken up in 8 �l of 40 mM
imidazole buffer, pH 6.5, before 156 �l of 1 mg of dipalmitoyl
phosphatidylethanolamine/ml chloroform/ethanol (1:1, v/v)
was added. The reaction mixture was kept at 50 °
C for 2 h,
and after addition of 10 mg of sodium cyanogen borohy-
dride/ml ethanol (8 �l), it was incubated overnight under the
same conditions. Dried by vacuum rotation, the neoglycolip-
ids were solubilized in 500 �l of methanol for application
onto polystyrene plates by drying 50-�l aliquots per well at
37 °
C.
Norovirus capsid binding and binding inhibition assays
VLP binding and inhibition assays were performed either on
immobilized human gastric mucins (HGM, 10 �g/ml) from
pooled gastric juice of blood group undefined subjects or on
HGM from blood group Lewis-defined individuals. For HMO
inhibition experiments, immobilized porcine stomach mucins
(type III, Sigma, 10 �g/ml) were used. Other series of experi-
ments were based on the above-described neoglycolipid arrays.
Polystyrene-immobilized HGM, porcine stomach mucins, or
neoglycolipid arrays were blocked with 5% BSA/PBS for 1 h at
37 °
C before VLPs were applied at 10 �g of protein per ml of
0.05% Tween 20/PBS in the absence or presence of inhibitor.
After incubation for 1 h at 37 °
C and three plate-washing steps
with 0.5% BSA/PBS, bound capsids were detected with poly-
clonal rabbit GII.4 capsid protein antiserum (diluted 1:3000 in
0.5% BSA/PBS). A monoclonal anti-GII.10 was used in combi-
nation with anti-mouse IgG-biotin. Anti-rabbit Ig–alkaline
phosphatase, diluted 1:5000, or anti-rabbit Ig–horseradish per-
oxidase (HRP), diluted 1:2500 in 0.5% BSA/PBS (GII.4), or
StrepTactin-alkaline phosphatase, diluted 1:1000 (GII.10),
were used for development (1 h at 37 °
C), followed by three
washing steps and addition of the substrate: 1) para-nitrophe-
nyl phosphate (1 mg/ml) in 0.1 M diethanolamine buffer, pH 9.8,
containing MgCl2 (0.5 mM) or 2) ortho-phenylenediamine/hy-
drogen peroxide in phosphate citrate buffer. Plates were read
after 30 min at 405 or 490 nm in a Tecan Sunrise (Remote
Control) run with Magellan software.
In binding inhibition experiments, appropriate amounts of
inhibitor in the millimolar range were dried from stock solu-
tions and resolubilized in 0.5% Tween 20/PBS containing 10
�g/ml VLP protein. In binding analyses with anti-blood group
Lewis-b, the monoclonal mouse antibody 2–25LE (25) (Biozol,
Eiching, Germany) was used at 1:200 dilution. For lectin-bind-
ing studies, the agglutinin from Ulex europaeus isoform I was
used in a biotinylated form (Sigma), diluted to 20 �g/ml in 0.5%
BSA/PBS, and applied in 50-�l aliquots onto neoglycolipid
arrays prepared and developed as described above.
Chromatographic separation of milk oligosaccharides
Between 100 and 300 ml of mature human milk from differ-
ent donors were defatted, deproteinized, and separated by gel-
filtration and anion-exchange chromatography as originally
described by Egge et al. (26). Identification and characterization
of HMOs, particularly of isomeric structures, were achieved
by high performance anion-exchange chromatography with
pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) in combination
with MALDI-TOF as described previously (27, 28).
Separation of reducing oligosaccharides from human milk
was performed by reversed-phase chromatography on 100 �
2.1-mm Hypercarb column (Thermoquest, 5�) run at 0.5
ml/min in a gradient from 0 to 80% acetonitrile in water (dura-
tion 20 min). UV detection of the carbohydrates was performed
at 192 nm.
MALDI-MS
MALDI-MS and MS/MS were performed on a Bruker Ultra-
flextreme TOF/TOF instrument (Bruker, Bremen, Germany)
in the reflectron positive-ion mode. Native glycans were
applied onto stainless steel targets by mixing 0.5-�l aliquots
solubilized in water with 1-�l aliquots of the matrix 2,5-dihy-
droxybenzoic acid in acetonitrile, 0.1% aqueous TFA (1:2, v/v).
Permethylated glycans were applied as methanol solutions by
mixing 0.75 �l with an equal volume of saturated 4-hydroxy-�-
cinnamininic acid in 50% acetonitrile, /0.1% aqueous TFA.
Linkage analysis by GC-MS
Permethylation of glycans was performed as described
previously by Albersheim et al. (29). The completeness of
derivatization was controlled by MALDI-MS, and the oligosac-
charides were hydrolyzed, reduced, and acetylated to obtain
partially methylated alditol acetates (29). Separation and iden-
tification of partially methylated alditol acetates were achieved
on a Fison MD800 mass detector (Fison/Thermo) coupled to a
gas chromatograph (GC8000 series). A temperature gradient
from 60 to 100 °
C (40 °
C/min), and from 100 °
C to 260 °
C
(10 °
C/min) was run on a Restec Rxi-Sil MS (15 m, 0.25-mm
inner diameter, 0.25 �m).
