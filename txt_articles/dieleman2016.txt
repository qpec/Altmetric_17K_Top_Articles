Summary
Background Disbursements of development assistance for health (DAH) have risen substantially during the past 
several decades. More recently, the international community’s attention has turned to other international challenges, 
introducing uncertainty about the future of disbursements for DAH.
Methods We collected audited budget statements, annual reports, and project-level records from the main international 
agencies that disbursed DAH from 1990 to the end of 2015. We standardised and combined records to provide a 
comprehensive set of annual disbursements. We tracked each dollar of DAH back to the source and forward to the 
recipient. We removed transfers between agencies to avoid double-counting and adjusted for infl
 ation. We classifi
 ed 
assistance into nine primary health focus areas: HIV
/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, maternal health, newborn and 
child health, other infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, Ebola, and sector-wide approaches and health 
system strengthening. For our statistical analysis, we grouped these health focus areas into two categories: MDG-
related focus areas (HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, child and newborn health, and maternal health) and non-MDG-
related focus areas (other infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, sector-wide approaches, and other). We 
used linear regression to test for structural shifts in disbursement patterns at the onset of the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs; ie, from 2000) and the global fi
 nancial crisis (impact estimated to occur in 2010). We built on past 
trends and associations with an ensemble model to estimate DAH through the end of 2040.
Findings In 2015, US$36·4 billion of DAH was disbursed, marking the fi
 fth consecutive year of little change in the 
amount of resources provided by global health development partners. Between 2000 and 2009, DAH increased at 
11·3% per year, whereas between 2010 and 2015, annual growth was just 1·2%. In 2015, 29·7% of DAH was for 
HIV/AIDS, 17·9% was for child and newborn health, and 9·8% was for maternal health. Linear regression identifi
 es 
three distinct periods of growth in DAH. Between 2000 and 2009, MDG-related DAH increased by $290·4 million 
(95% uncertainty interval [UI] 174·3 million to 406·5 million) per year. These increases were signifi
 cantly greater 
than were increases in non-MDG DAH during the same period (p=0·009), and were also signifi
 cantly greater than 
increases in the previous period (p<0·0001). Between 2000 and 2009, growth in DAH was highest for HIV
/AIDS, 
malaria, and tuberculosis. Since 2010, DAH for maternal health and newborn and child health has continued to 
climb, although DAH for HIV
/AIDS and most other health focus areas has remained fl
 at or decreased. Our estimates 
of future DAH based on past trends and associations present a wide range of potential futures, although our mean 
estimate of $64·1 billion (95% UI $30·4 billion to $161·8 billion) shows an increase between now and 2040, although 
with a large uncertainty interval.
Interpretation Our results provide evidence of two substantial shifts in DAH growth during the past 26 years. DAH 
disbursements increased faster in the fi
 rst decade of the 2000s than in the 1990s, but DAH associated with the MDGs 
increased the most out of all focus areas. Since 2010, limited growth has characterised DAH and we expect this pattern 
to persist. Despite the fact that DAH is still growing, albeit minimally, DAH is shifting among the major health focus 
areas, with relatively little growth for HIV
/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. These changes in the growth and focus of 
DAH will have critical eff
 ects on health services in some low-income countries. Coordination and collaboration between 
donors and domestic governments is more important than ever because they have a great opportunity and responsibility 
to ensure robust health systems and service provision for those most in need.

Introduction
During the past decade, substantial growth in health 
fi
 nancing has contributed to progress toward global 
health goals. At the turn of the millennium, 129·0 
of every 1000 children died before the age of 5 years, 
499·5 of every 100 000 women died due to complications 
from childbirth, and HIV
/AIDS mortality was climbing 
9·4% each year in low-income countries.1–4 In an 
unprecedented response, world leaders came together to 
create the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 
2001.5 Three of the eight goals aimed to improve health. 
MDG 4 called for a two-thirds reduction in under-5 
mortality; MDG 5 called for the reduction of maternal 
mortality by three-quarters; and MDG 6 called for the

reversal of the spread of HIV
/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, 
and other major infectious diseases.6
Since the adoption of the MDGs by the UN General 
Assembly, 
development 
partners 
worldwide 
have 
increased in size and number, with some focused 
exclusively on the specifi
 c diseases targeted by the 
MDGs. Some of the now-largest global health 
organisations did not exist or had been recently created 
in 2000, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation 
(the Gates Foundation); Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi); 
The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and 
Malaria (the Global Fund); The US President’s 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR); and the 
President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI).
Whereas the MDG era saw tremendous success in 
improving international resources for health, other 
global 
issues—including 
the 
continued 
fi
 nancial 
insecurity provoked by the global fi
 nancial crisis, the 
unprecedented number of migrants seeking asylum in 
Europe and elsewhere, and issues related to climate 
change—are 
now 
capturing 
the 
international 
community’s attention. These issues mark a potential 
shift away from the traditional global health landscape 
that has characterised the past several decades.
To better understand past and future trends in global 
health, this paper presents health focus area-specifi
 c 
estimates of development assistance for health (DAH) 
from 1990 to the end of 2015, with predictions of total 
DAH up to 2040. With these estimates of DAH, we 
explore the associations between the establishment of 
the MDGs, the scale-up in terms of funding and global 
health actors, the composition of DAH across key health 
focus areas, and the recent stagnation in DAH.
Methods
Data
DAH refers to the in-kind and fi
 nancial resources 
transferred from primary development channels to low-
income and middle-income countries for the purpose of 
maintaining or improving health.7,8 We tracked DAH 
from 1990 to the end of 2015 using methods developed 
by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We 
collected audited budget statements, annual reports, and 
project-level records from the main international 
agencies that disbursed DAH from 1990 to the end of 
2015. We collected data from all publicly available 
sources of development assistance and obtained 
additional data through correspondence to augment any 
gaps in these data. We standardised and combined 
records to provide a comprehensive set of annual 
disbursements. In some cases, disbursements are 
modelled based on past trends, commitment data, and 
budget data. In-depth information about our methods 
for tracking primary sources of DAH and dealing with 
lags in data reporting and the removal of funds that are 
counted multiple times when agencies transfer funds 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Much research has sought to describe the disbursement of 
development assistance for health (DAH). Previous research 
articles and reports by the Institute for Health Metrics and 
Evaluation have tracked DAH from 1990 onward, 
disaggregating spending by the source of funding, 
intermediary channel, recipient country, and health focus 
area. Other studies have concentrated on specifi
 c health focus 
areas, such as the estimates produced by Countdown to 2015, 
which focused on maternal, child, and newborn health. In 
addition to resource tracking, separate, relatively contentious 
lines of research have aimed to measure the eff
 ectiveness of 
DAH, and the practice in which development assistance 
displaces government spending. These studies vary in scope 
and conclusion, with some focusing on cross-country 
longitudinal analyses, and others concentrating on a single 
country or programme. Finally, there is a substantial body of 
research that aims to connect governance and DAH, and 
explores how DAH is allocated across recipient countries and 
health focus areas. Conclusions from these studies have been 
quite mixed.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the fi
 rst study to track DAH up to the 
end of 2015, the fi
 rst to statistically evaluate changes in DAH 
disbursement over time, and the fi
 rst to use past trends and 
associations to estimate the amount of development 
assistance expected to be provided in the future. Our results 
show that the past 26 years were characterised by three 
distinct periods, with moderate growth in the 1990s, 
accelerated growth in the fi
 rst decade of the 2000s, and 
stagnation since 2010. Additionally, these varying historic 
trends show that there is a great deal of uncertainty about the 
total amount of DAH that will be provided in the future, with 
mean estimates showing substantially slower growth in the 
future than in previous years. Finally, this study makes use of 
improved methods and more detailed tracking than has been 
previously employed.
Implications of all the available evidence
The era of major growth in DAH has, at least temporarily, 
ended. This is crucial for poor people who live in countries 
where domestic resources fall short of the minimum needed to 
cover health needs. Still, substantial uncertainty exists in our 
predictions, showing the enormous potential for donors and 
international policy makers to contribute to health gains 
through the allocation of more resources. Such gains could be 
achieved by use of innovative health fi
 nancing measures to 
encourage domestic spending and by increasing effi
  ciency of 
existing resources.

and are shown in the appendix.
We divide DAH into nine primary, mutually exclusive 
focus areas: HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, maternal 
health, newborn and child health, other infectious 
diseases, non-communicable diseases, Ebola, and sector-
wide approaches and strengthening of health systems. 
Two additional health focus areas exist: resources defi
 ned 
as other are projects that do not fi
 t into one of our 
primary health focus areas; and resources defi
 ned as 
unallocable are projects for which we do not have 
suffi
  cient information to identify the health focus area of 
a particular grant or loan.
For our statistical analysis, we grouped the health focus 
areas into two categories: MDG-related (HIV
/AIDS, 
tuberculosis, malaria, child and newborn health, and 
maternal health) and non-MDG-related (other infectious 
diseases, 
non-communicable 
diseases, 
sector-wide 
approaches, and other) focus areas. We removed 
unallocable and Ebola funding because we did not have

South Korea, which is also now a high-income country, only for those years in which it received DAH; unallocable corresponds to DAH for which we do not have project-level information and cannot 
parse to a region; and 2014 and 2015 are not disaggregated to recipient level because of data limitations. In D, other corresponds to DAH for which we have project-level information but which is not 
identifi
 ed as funding any of the health focus areas that we tracked; and unallocable corresponds to DAH for which we do not have project-level information and cannot parse across health focus areas.

suffi
  cient information for these areas. Together, these 
two categories made up less than 5% of total DAH in 
2015. All tracked funds are converted to 2015 US dollars 
to adjust for infl
 ation.
Past trends and associations
We used linear regression to estimate whether DAH for 
the MDG-related focus areas has increased signifi
 cantly 
faster than for other focus areas, and to test whether 
structural shifts exist in the manner in which DAH has 
grown over time. By use of ordinary least squares analysis, 
we regressed annual changes in DAH on an intercept and 
fi
 ve binary indicators. The fi
 rst indicator marked the years 
between 2000 and 2009 and tested whether a structural 
shift (eg, a systematic change) occurred in annual increases 
in DAH disbursed during these years. The second 
indicator marked the years after 2009 and tested whether a 
structural shift occurred in annual increases in DAH 
during these years. The third indicator marked 
MDG-related health focus areas and tested whether DAH 
for these areas increased at a faster pace than for non-
MDG-related health focus areas between 1990 and 1999. 
Finally, the MDG indicator was multiplied by each of the 
time indicators to produce the fourth and fi
 fth indicators, 
which tested whether the MDG-related health focus areas 
grew at distinct rates during either of these periods. We 
used a Wald test to assess the statistical signifi
 cance of 
diff
 erences between the coeffi
  cient estimates. We also did 
sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our results, 
which are described in the appendix.
Estimation of total development assistance to 2040
We use past trends and associations and an ensemble 
model to estimate future disbursements of DAH through 
the end of 2040. For this analysis, we stratifi
 ed DAH by 
source using an ensemble modelling method. This 
approach, which aggregates across a diverse set of 
modelled scenarios, allows us to avoid basing estimates 
on a single model specifi
 cation. We chose an ensemble 
model 
because 
exploration 
of 
various 
model 
specifi
 cations showed that estimates were highly 
dependent on the specifi
 cation and choice of variable.
DAH was measured as the share of the source 
country’s gross domestic product (GDP), where GDP 
was measured 2 years before disbursement of the DAH. 
We used this 2 year lag because DAH is budgeted and 
committed several years before it is disbursed. We took 
the natural log of the DAH divided by GDP fraction to 
avoid 
modelling 
negative 
values 
and 
to 
ease 
interpretation of coeffi
  cient estimates. We modelled 
year-over-year changes in DAH (fi
 rst diff
 erences). We 
used fi
 rst diff
 erences because the Levin-Lin-Chu unit 
root test could not reject the null hypothesis that the 
non-diff
 erenced data were non-stationary (p=0·167) and 
suitable for econometric forecasts. Potential covariates 
to predict changes in DAH disbursed by each source 
were auto-regressive terms (up to three lags of the 
dependent variable), the fi
 rst-diff
 erenced natural 
logarithm of GDP per capita, a convergence term 
(lagged level of the dependent variable), and country-
specifi
 c fi
 xed or random intercepts. Finally, we included 
an indicator to control for the 2000 to 2009 scale-up of 
DAH. This indicator allows the growth observed during 
these years to be treated as an anomaly, with the high 
growth during this time unlikely to be repeated. All 
potential combinations of these covariates, 400 models 
in total, were considered for inclusion in our ensemble.
To be included in the ensemble, a model needed to 
pass three inclusion criteria. First, only models for which 
all coeffi
  cient estimates were signifi
 cant (α=0·1) were 
included. Second, if included, the coeffi
  cient estimate for 
the convergence term was required to be less than zero, 
prohibiting exponential growth. Third, scenarios were 
required to fall within a range of plausible growth rates. 
This range was determined empirically based on annual 
changes in DAH between 1990 and 2015. The appendix 
contains complete descriptions of these criteria and all 
our methods. 22 models passed all three criteria so were 
included in our ensemble model.
We included four types of uncertainty for these 
prospective estimates. First, we used the ensemble 
modelling approach to show the uncertainty in model 
specifi
 cation by averaging across a diverse set of 
22 specifi
 cations. Second, we took draws from the 
variance-covariance matrix estimated for each model to 
represent parameter uncertainty. Third, we randomly 
selected a GDP series from the previously forecasted 
distribution of GDP estimates. This sampling captures 
uncertainty in our underlying data. Fourth, for each 
scenario, we estimated the country-specifi
 c distribution of 
residuals. These residuals represent unexplained change 
in the amount of DAH disbursed. We added random 
draws from each distribution to each country and year for 
each scenario to capture fundamental model uncertainty. 
The mean of these draws is the reported point estimate,

Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The corresponding author had full access to 
all the data in the study and had fi
 nal responsibility for 
the decision to submit for publication.
Results
We used more than 60 data sources. Data were collected 
from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD)’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS); 
the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC); 
project-level data from the Gates Foundation, the Global 
Fund, Gavi, and the World Bank; grant-level data from the 
Foundation 
Center; 
non-governmental 
organisation 
(NGO) data from the US Agency for International 
Development (USAID)’s annual Report of Voluntary 
Agencies; and a diverse set of audited fi
 nancial records and 
annual budgets. Detailed data used to create the fi
 gures are 
available online. From 1990 to 2015, a total of $502·7 billion 
of DAH was disbursed. In 2015 alone, $36·4 billion was 
provided, a major increase from 1990, in which DAH 
amounted to $7·2 billon, and 2000, when DAH was 
$11·7 billion. Since 2010 annual disbursements have 
changed very little, with DAH generally stable at about 
$35·0 billion. Past trends and associations suggest that 
DAH will remain stable, with the 2040 estimate of DAH at

Unallocable in terms of health focus area corresponds to DAH for which we do not have project-level information and cannot parse across health focus areas. Latin America and the Caribbean includes 
Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, which are now high-income countries. Southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania includes South Korea for 1994, which is also now a high-income country. Unallocable in 
recipient region also corresponds to DAH for which we do not have project-level information and thus, cannot parse across recipients. DAH=development assistance for health. NGO=non-

$64·1 billion (95% UI $30·4 billion to $161·8 billion) with 
a large uncertainty interval surrounding the estimate.
Figure 1 shows these increases and the recent 
stagnation of DAH disbursements. The US Government 
was consistently the largest source of DAH throughout 
the study period, providing between 23·0% and 36·8% 
of total DAH each year. A diverse set of intermediary 
channels have disbursed DAH, with substantial support 
provided by NGOs ($6·9 billion [18·9%] in 2015) and 
bilateral aid agencies ($11·7 billion [32·1%] in 2015). 
Additionally, fi
 gure 1 marks the genesis of several now 
major channels of DAH, including the Global Fund 
($3·3 billion [9·1%] of the total in 2015), the Gates 
Foundation ($1·8 billion [4·9%]), and Gavi ($1·6 billion 
[4·5%]). The largest share of DAH that can be traced to a 
specifi
 c geographic region was targeted at sub-Saharan 
Africa. In 2015, $10·8 billion (29·7%) of DAH was for 
HIV
/AIDS, $6·5 billion (17·9%) was for child and 
newborn health, and $3·6 billion (9·8%) was for 
maternal health.
Between 1990 and 1999, total DAH grew at an 
annualised rate of 4·6% (fi
 gure 2), and between 
2000 and 2009, the annualised growth rate rose to 11·3%. 
However, the annualised growth rate fell to 1·2% 
between 2010 and 2015. During the period of accelerated 
growth between 2000 and 2009, DAH for MDG-related 
focus areas increased the most compared with other 
focus areas. HIV
/AIDS, in particular, received substantial 
support, with annualised growth reaching 24·1%. Since 
2010, DAH for HIV
/AIDS grew at 1·3% annually, slower 
than the annual growth of DAH for NCDs, which was 
1·9%. Between 2010 and 2015, MDG-related health focus 
areas increased at an annualised rate of 2·1% each year, 
whereas non-MDG-related health focus areas increased 
at 1·0% annually. However, all health focus areas were 
aff
 ected by the major deceleration in 2010. Since 2010, 
DAH for maternal health and newborn and child health 
has continued to climb, although DAH for HIV/AIDS 
and most other health focus areas has remained fl
 at 
or decreased.

Figure 3 shows the complexity of international funding 
fl
 ows for health from 2000 to 2013. Between 
2000 and 2013, 31·7% of DAH was provided by the US 
Government, 25·8% of DAH targeted HIV
/AIDS, and 
27·2% was disbursed in sub-Saharan Africa. During this 
period, 60·2% of DAH allocable to a health focus area 
was associated with the MDGs. 
In 2000, $5·7 billion of DAH was disbursed for 
MDG-related health focus areas, with 18·3% of total 
DAH targeting maternal health and 16·1% targeting 
newborn and child health programmes. In that same 
year, HIV/AIDS was the focus of 11·1% of DAH, and 
malaria and tuberculosis programmes each received less 
than 2·1%. By 2015, the cumulative total amount of DAH 
targeting MDG-related focus areas was $24·4 billion, 
with DAH for HIV/AIDS reaching 29·7% of total DAH. 
Newborn and child health received 17·9% of total 
disbursements, maternal health received 9·8%, malaria 
received 6·3%, and tuberculosis received 3·4%. DAH for 
other health focus areas also increased between 2000 and 
2015, but to a lesser extent. For example, in 2015 health 
system support represented $2·7 billion (7·3%) and non-
communicable diseases represented $475 million (1·3%).
The primary sources and intermediary channels of DAH 
prioritise diff
 erent health focus areas and these priorities 
can shift over time, as shown in fi
 gure 4. The Gates 
Foundation has had mostly constant priorities, with the 
largest focus on newborn and child health and HIV
/AIDS. 
Gavi has prioritised child health, although the share of 
Gavi funding focused on health system strengthening has 
increased. The Global Fund targets nearly 50% of its 
resources at HIV
/AIDS, with the remaining resources 
mainly focused on malaria, tuberculosis, and health 
system strengthening. Similar to the Global Fund, the US 
Government targets most of its assistance at HIV
/AIDS. 
UN agencies and the UK gvovernment both fund a wide 
variety of priority areas. The World Bank is the largest 
funder of health system strengthening.
According to our linear regression testing for structural 
shifts in DAH disbursement rates over time, between 
2000 and 2009, DAH for MDG-related health focus areas 
increased faster than did DAH for non-MDG health focus 
areas (table). On average, DAH for MDG-related health 
focus areas increased by $290·4 million per year (95% UI 
174·3 million to 406·5 million) between 2000 and 2009. 
This increase is signifi
 cantly larger than the annual 
increase for the same causes before 2000 (p<0·0001), 
which was $41·6 million (95% UI –19·6 million to 
102·8 million). This increase was also signifi
 cantly larger 
than the average annual increase for non-MDG health 
focus areas between 2000 and 2009 (p=0·009), which was 
$98·6 million per year (95% UI 14·6 million to 
182·6 million). Since 2010, growth has been signifi
 cantly 
slower for both MDG and non-MDG health focus areas 
than in either of the previous two decades. During this 
period, the annual increases for MDG and non-MDG 
health focus areas were not signifi
 cantly diff
 erent from 
each other. These conclusions were supported by the 
results of our sensitivity analysis (appendix).
The future of DAH disbursements is uncertain 
(fi
 gure 5). We estimate annualised growth rates between 
2015 and 2040 ranging from –0·72% (lower UI bound) to 
5·96% (upper UI bound). The mean 2040 estimate 
predicts that across all sources of DAH, $64·1 billion 
(95% UI 30·4 billion to 161·8 billion) will be provided. 
Our estimates, reported with infl
 ation-adjusted 2015 US 
dollars, are strongly aff
 ected by whether the scale-up 
between 2000 and 2009 is judged to be an anomaly or a 
persistent part of a long-term trend.
Discussion
Substantial, 
statistically 
signifi
 cant 
shifts 
have 
characterised the disbursement of DAH over the past 
26 years. The health focus areas associated with the 
MDGs were a central part of the development agenda 
from 2000 onward. The relatively narrow scope of well 
defi
 ned priorities marks 2000 as a moment of unique 
international consensus. Our DAH estimates support

claims that the international community rallied around 
the health focus areas targeted by the MDGs.
Not only was the majority of health aid over the past 
16 years concentrated on the MDGs, but DAH for 
MDG-related health focus areas (HIV/AIDS, malaria, 
tuberculosis, maternal health, and newborn and child 
health) grew substantially faster than for other areas. 
Since 2000, $254·7 billion, or 61·3% of DAH, was 
provided for the MDG-related health focus areas. Annual 
growth in DAH for these health focus areas reached 
10·2% per year from 2000 to 2015, substantially higher 
than the 4·8% annual growth for non-MDG-related 
DAH. Our evidence also shows that 2000 marked a shift 
in the annual rate of DAH growth. Since then, the health 
focus areas that grew the most, in absolute and relative 
terms, were those encompassed by the MDGs.
Data from the 2010 to 2015 and our future projections, 
suggest that substantial scale-up of DAH has not been 
sustained. Our projections for the next 25 years present 
growth rates surrounded by substantial uncertainty. The 
end of the scale-up suggests that we have entered an era 
of stagnation in DAH, which might lead to substantial 
shifts in how global health is fi
 nanced. Recipient 
countries, organisations such as the Global Fund and 
Gavi, and programmes such as PEPFAR, which have 
grown nearly exponentially since their creation, might 
fi
 nd themselves in a new period of constrained resources.
Compounding the impact of this stagnation is the 
possibility that development assistance partners might 
move away from the health focus areas that they previously 
prioritised. Throughout the past decade, some people 
pointed out the seemingly disproportional focus of DAH 
on HIV
/AIDS compared with the health burden of 
HIV
/AIDS.9,14–17 Since 2010, DAH for non-communicable 
diseases and other infectious diseases has grown faster 
than DAH for HIV
/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis 
(fi
 gure 2). These estimates suggest that sources of 
assistance and development partners might be shifting 
their attention towards other health focus areas. This shift 
is hugely consequential for the 15·6 million individuals on 
antiretroviral 
therapy, 
and 
necessitates 
important 
discussions about the need to scale up domestic funding 
in low-income and middle-income countries.18
Data issues represent the main limitation of our 
analysis. Our assumptions about the relevance of 
keywords and how projects are divided between health 
focus areas aff
 ect the division of funds. For some 
estimates, we also used models to estimate dis-
bursements, based on commitment data and how DAH 
was allocated in the most recent years (appendix). These 
methods are described in full in the appendix, have been 
peer-reviewed, and discussed in depth previously.10,19 
Still, advanced methods do not replace the need for 
improved accounting and tracking.9–13 Development 
assistance partners have greatly improved the detail and 
availability of fi
 nancial data, but key improvements are 
still needed.
An additional limitation of this paper is that we tracked 
and estimated only a single type of health fi
 nancing: 
DAH. DAH reached $36·4 billion in 2015, although other 
sources of health fi
 nancing such as government or private 
health spending are, in many countries, a much larger 
share of total health spending. In 2013, governments in 
low-income 
and 
middle-income 
countries 
spent 
$764·9 billion on health.20,21 However, government 
spending is highly variable between countries and is 
substantially lower in the low-income countries where 
most DAH is targeted. On average, across low-income 
countries in 2013, $0·71 of DAH was provided for every 
$1 of domestic government fi
 nancing,20,21 making it a 
critical resource. Additionally, DAH can play an important 
part in the funding of global public goods, providing for 
neglected populations or diseases and encouraging 
increases in domestic fi
 nancing.
The launch of the MDGs was marked by growth in the 
size and number of development partners concentrating 
on health, especially those concentrating on HIV
/AIDS 
and other MDG-related health focus areas. Development 
assistance for these areas grew quickly, especially before 
the global fi
 nancial crisis. Our results show that 2000 and 
2009 mark signifi
 cant shifts in the growth rates of DAH. 
MDG-related and non-MDG health focus areas had 
distinct growth trajectories during the scale-up in funding 
from 2000 to 2009. At the launch of the MDGs, DAH for 
all health focus areas began to grow at increased rates, but 
DAH associated with the MDGs increased the most. 
Although the period of scale-up corresponds with the 
establishment of MDGs and subsequent stagnation 
following the fi
 nancial crisis, it is outside the scope of this 
paper to test whether these events are causally connected.
Since 2010, stagnation has characterised growth in 
DAH across all health focus areas. Past trends and 
associations suggest that this stagnation might be the 
new reality, rather than just a temporary anomaly. 
However, the wide uncertainty intervals surrounding our 
projections represent a challenge for global health donors. 
The amount of DAH provided, and what it is targeted 
towards in the future, will have critical eff
 ects on health 
systems and health services provided in some countries. 
The uncertain future of DAH suggests that now is the 
moment for global leaders and donors to sustain their 
commitment to global health. Ongoing support can target 
marginalised sub-populations, encourage and catalyse 
effi
  ciency, and garner additional domestic support.
With the offi
  cial ending of the MDG era, we look 
forward to the broader realisation of the Sustainable 
Development Goals with the hope that this new era 
pushes gains in health forward. However, this new era 
has so far been punctuated by a host of other major 
international crises. This situation underlines the un-
precedented need for coordination among inter 
national 
and domestic funders to ensure critical resources for 
health are provided and used effi
  ciently. To this end, 
timely and detailed retrospective and prospective

estimates of health fi
 nancing are more important than 
ever, providing a vital input into decision making about 
resource allocation choices and how to tackle acute 
funding gaps.
