Abstract
Background
The urban environment has been criticized for promoting ‘nature-deficit’ and ‘child-nature
disconnectedness’. Keeping in mind the importance of nature exposure and its extensive
health benefits, many environmental programs around the world hope to (re)connect chil-
dren with nature. To evaluate the effectiveness of such efforts, valid tools to measure Con-
nectedness to Nature (CN) are needed but do not exist today, especially for use with pre-
schoolers.
Methods
The original CN Index was modified and tested among the Parents of Preschool Children
(CNI-PPC) in an urban setting (Hong Kong) for its internal consistency (n = 299) and exter-
nal validity (n = 194). The ‘Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire’ (SDQ) was chosen for
divergent and convergent analysis. Conventional recommendations for test adaptation and
translation were used.
Results
Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed that the 16-item scale adequately captured
four major dimensions: enjoyment of nature, empathy for nature, responsibility toward
nature, and awareness of nature (Cronbach’s α were respectively .86, .87, .75 and .80).
When tested against the SDQ, a validated measure for child psychological functioning, and
identification of children’s problem behaviours, three CNI-PPC factors influenced the SDQ
outcomes: (1) the more enjoyment of nature children displayed the less overall distress and
impairment they exhibited (β = -.64); (2) greater responsibility toward nature in children was
associated with less hyperactivity (β = -.50), fewer behavioural and peer difficulties (β = -.62
and β = -.65 respectively) and improved prosocial behaviour (β = .77); (3) the more aware
children were of nature, the less emotional difficulties they exhibited (β = -.51). The variance
explained was large (range R2 = .42 to .80).

 Conclusions
Thus, CNI-PPC factors have meaningful and substantive associations with the strengths
and difficulties parents perceive in their children. This indicates that the CNI-PPC is a valid
and reliable instrument to measure CN at an age when children cannot respond for them-
selves. Further, this simple tool can help researchers/practitioners to better understand how
connectedness to nature affects child psychological functioning and wellbeing.

Background
Around 50 per cent of people worldwide, and 100 per cent of people in Hong Kong, live in an
urban setting [1]. At the same time, around 78 per cent of urban Hong Kong is surrounded by
open green areas and 90 per cent of the population lives within 400 metres of such areas [2].
This is comparable to the 300-meter indicator laid-out by the WHO for monitoring imple-
mentation of the Parma Declaration commitment to providing every child with access to
“green spaces to play and undertake physical activity” [3, 4]. However, despite Hong Kong’s
extensive, adjacent greenness, 16 per cent of pre-schoolers in Hong Kong and up to 22% in
China show signs of mental health problems [5, 6].
Connectedness to Nature (CN) is defined as “an individual’s affective, experiential connec-
tion to nature” [7]. In adults, CN appears to consist of three components: cognitive (personal
awareness or understanding of being a part of nature); affective (sensitivity towards nature
protection); and behavioural (individual engagement in nature protection) [8]. In young chil-
dren, CN has been suggested to be associated with two components (i.e., the cognitive and the
affective) [9]. A ‘unique affinity’ for the natural environment, ‘ecological self’, and self-cogni-
tion related to the surrounding nature progresses from early childhood through adulthood
[10]. Environmental attitudes develop early in life [11, 12] and early childhood appears to be a
crucial period for developing a bond with nature [13]. During this developmental period,
some important milestones relevant to CN (esp. vis-à-vis animal life) occur, including theory
of mind, empathy, and affective perspective taking [14]. Around the age of two, children start
responding to and caring for objects in the natural world [15] and by the time they enter
school, children start to demonstrate a relationship with nature in multiple ways (e.g., trust vs.
mistrust; attempting to make sense of what they see, hear, touch, taste, and smell; spatial
autonomy with interest in micro-spaces, inside bushes, or under trees) [16–22]. Deeper under-
standing of preschoolers’ relationship with the natural world is warranted but remains difficult
to achieve due to the lack of valid measuring tools, making it a significant knowledge gap.
1.1 Impact of connectedness to nature on health
Leisure activities of young children living in urban settings today have shifted from active, out-
door, nature-based play to passive indoor activities [23]. This shift has had negative impacts on
children’s language and cognitive development and has even been associated with low self-
confidence [24]. In contrast, contact with nature is positively associated with children’s length
and quality of sleep [25], levels of physical activity [26], lower stress [27], superior cognitive
skills (e.g., attention ability, working memory, intellectual and problem solving skills and

 creativity) [28–31]. Meanwhile, lower physical activity and higher sedentary behaviour have
been associated with lower psychological well-being (reflected by total difficulties scores, peer
problems, and emotional symptoms) as measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Question-
naire (SDQ), a validated measure for child psychological functioning [32]. In summary, expo-
sure to nature contributes to both better physiological and mental health outcomes for
children [33].
Keeping in mind the importance of exposure to nature and its health benefits, many envi-
ronmental programs around the world, including in China, hope to (re)connect children with
nature [34]. However, to evaluate the effectiveness of such efforts, robust tools to measure CN
among all targeted populations are needed. At present, none of the existing methods for mea-
suring children’s CN have been validated for use among preschool-aged children. Since chil-
dren in this age group are at a critical point in becoming connected to nature, it is imperative
that tools are available to capture this information. Hence, this study has tried to develop a tool
that could reliably measure the degree of connectedness that young children have to their nat-
ural surroundings. The availability of such tools would help with evaluation of interventions,
systems, or policies that seek to overcome barriers created by an urban environment.
1.2 Challenges in measuring connectedness to nature
Tools that measure CN are highly age-specific, partly because of the difficulty in separating
emotional affinity toward nature (affective) from interest in nature (cognition) [35]. Among a
growing number of CN measurement tools for adults, two are commonly used: the Nature
Relatedness Scale (NRS) [36] and the Connectedness to Nature Scale (CNS) [7]. The Inclusion
of Nature in Self (INS) [8] for school children uses single items and cannot be assessed for reli-
ability. The only tool designed for younger school children, the Connection to Nature Index
(CNI), targets 4th-grade students and includes items relating to children’s feelings when in
nature, their perceptions of human–nature relationships, and their concern for plants and ani-
mals; the themes were based on factors used in measurement tools for adults: (a) enjoyment of
nature, (b) empathy for its creatures, (c) sense of oneness, and (d) sense of responsibility [37].
A number of challenges exist in investigating CN among preschool children. Clearly, their
ability to make fine distinctions, especially between emotional affinity towards nature and cog-
nitive interest, can be limited [7, 38]. Furthermore, younger children may have difficulties in
distinguishing gradations in rating scales because they tend to think dichotomously (e.g., chil-
dren are either awake or asleep) [39]. Nonetheless, it is highly likely that they have developed a
degree of CN through their childhood [12]. Given that the 24-item CNI [37] was used with
children aged 8–10 years old, it was the primary choice for adaptation for urban pre-schoolers.
Still, the targeted group of this study differed from Cheng and Monroe’s (2012), who lived in
an area outside major urban centres. The children in our sample were not only much younger
(most did not attend school), but also lived in a highly urbanized context. Thus, a broad adap-
tation of the existing CNI was necessary. Furthermore, we explored the possibility of parents
providing information about their children’s CN because parental-proxy measures of chil-
dren’s activities, behaviours, emotions, and feelings have been widely used in early childhood
research [40].
Two studies are reported. Study 1 reports the adaptation of the existing CNI into Chinese
and pilot testing of the translated version with a sample of urban children and their parents;
the Hong Kong setting presented a good example of such. Study 1 indicated the need to
explore, through qualitative interviews, parental perceptions of their children’s experience of
nature. This led to a revised pool of items for the Connectedness to Nature Index for Parents
of Preschool Children (CNI-PPC). Study 2 used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to

 determine the degree to which the four-factor structure of the CNI-PPC could be recovered.
Finally, the adjusted CNI-PPC was tested against the SDQ, a validated measure for child psy-
chological functioning [32].
The CNI-PPC may be the first tool for understanding and predicting environmental atti-
tudes and behaviours among preschool-aged children. The study was approved by the Ethical
Committee of the lead author’s University.
2. Study 1. Piloting of the original CNI and its adaptations
This study aimed to (1) evaluate if the original CNI [37] was applicable for parents of pre-
schoolers in a big city and (2) identify possible adaptations required to create a pool of valid
items relating to the CNI factors. To ensure adherence to the principles of evaluation and
adaptation of the existing CNI scale (i.e., familiarity of item contents, linguistic and cultural
consistency, and systematic evidence approach), conventional recommendations for test adap-
tation and translation were used [41].
2.1 Methods
Stage 1. The original CNI items were translated/back-translated into Cantonese using tra-
ditional Chinese script. The randomly chosen parents of 31 children aged 2 to 5 (mean
age = 2.16, SD = .90), together with their children, answered the 24 items, giving a rating for
their child. The families were recruited from all over Hong Kong and lived in apartment build-
ings, without any access to front or back yards, which is typical of Hong Kong’s compact living
environment. The inclusion criteria for participation in this study was that parents could
understand and respond to the Cantonese version of the questions. The children, as reported
by the parents, were physically and psychologically quite disconnected from nature and almost
50% of the original CNI items were marked as non-applicable by many parents. This indicated
that families were relatively unable to meaningfully answer a high proportion of the items, rais-
ing doubts about the suitability of the original questionnaire for either the age group or the
urban context.
Stage 2. To better understand the challenges reported by the participants responding to
these original questions, 20 parents participated in either face-to-face or phone interviews
about the CNI items. The semi-structured interview guide focused on environmental behav-
iours and was aligned with the four factors of the original CNI. The parents were asked if their
children, despite living in a big city, already possessed certain feelings about nature and their
reactions toward nature. They were encouraged to express opinions on the thematic issues
around the questions, using their own words, and/or to suggest other wordings. Substitute
items were generated in conversations with participants and finalised after all interviews were
concluded. The audio records of the interviews were transcribed and subjected to thematic
content analysis, using ThematiCoder [42].
Ethics approval and consent to participate.
The study was approved by the Ethical Com-
mittee of the University of Hong Kong (nr EA1502073).
2.2. Results
The participants were able to comment on all four themes of the original CNI and rate their
child on around half the items. Among those items (e.g., ‘When my child feels sad, he/ she
likes to go outside and enjoy nature’), low mean scores were frequently reported. Interviews
indicated that the low score arose because in an urban city like Hong Kong, going outside
meant being in a built environment, rather than a natural one. Items, such as hearing the

 different sounds of nature, were rejected because of difficulties in hearing nature in the noisy,
traffic-filled context of any big city.
The parents reported that the factor ‘Sense of Oneness’ was difficult to understand. Subse-
quent renaming of it as ‘Awareness of Nature’ allowed parents to understand it more easily.
Moreover, the experience of being alone in nature, fundamental to the concept of ‘oneness
with nature’ is a relatively rare experience for urban residents. On the other hand, expressing
interest in natural objects (i.e., plants and animals) through books or being aware of their exis-
tence are relatively simple processes to initiate. This meant that awareness of nature was priori-
tised over an ineffable sense of being part of nature.
All but one of the original items belonging to ‘Sense of Responsibility’, except for one, had
to be deleted. These items were complicated for participating families because urban residents
have very little control over parks and gardens, which are usually controlled by government
departments, and, as such, taking responsibility for the natural world is normally not exer-
cised. The retained item had to do with littering, which is prohibited in big cities like Hong
Kong. In connection to this, and based on feedback from the parents, an item on recycling was
added. It is important to add that, when answering the questions, the parents were instructed
to keep in mind the concept of responsibility toward nature in particular.
Moreover, parents considered the items from the ‘Empathy for Creatures’ factor to be too
abstract, largely because most urban apartment dwellers manage their daily lives without expo-
sure to wild animals. At the same time, ‘wild’ animals in Hong Kong can include monkeys and
snakes, which are a hazard to society and, thus, elicit little empathy from residents. Three of the
revised factor items focused instead upon care for living creatures and nature, which could
include other families’ pets, stray animals in the street, and the extensive insect and bird life of
the city. Indeed, care for caged crickets and birds is a classic Chinese practice, which is still seen
in the older and residential streets of Hong Kong. The lack of answers for items of this factor
suggests that respondents’ attitudes toward nature were shaped by the specific characteristics of
an urban society. It, therefore, was not surprising that many of the assumptions underlying the
original CNI items (developed in a more rural setting) were not applicable in a big city.
All the items were further adjusted to include the phrase ‘my child’ to ensure that the
parents focused clearly on their own family’s experiences rather than those generally in Hong
Kong. At the conclusion of this two-stage pilot process, a 20-item questionnaire (CNI-PPC)
was developed and administered to a sample of Hong Kong parents of preschool-aged
children.
3. Study 2. Large-scale evaluation
Firstly, the factor structure and criteria validity of the CNI-PPC were examined. Secondly,
external validation of the CNI-PPC was performed, using the SDQ for divergent and conver-
gent analysis. The SDQ was chosen on the presumption that a child’s problem behaviour
would be negatively related to his/ her connectedness to nature.
The version of the SDQ used in this study has been validated in Hong Kong already, and its
structure, internal consistency, and reliability was similar to the UK version[43]. It is a 25-item
screening questionnaire that assesses preschoolers’ mental health over the past six months by
five subscales of five items: emotional problems (symptoms), conduct problems, hyperactivity
(inattention), peer relationship problems, and prosocial behaviors.
3.1 Methods
Families (n = 299) with children between 2 and 5 years of age (51% boys, mean age = 2.7,
SD = 1.2) were recruited. All the parents (90.5% mothers, 9.1% fathers, and 0.3% others) were

 asked to complete the CNI-PPC, using a planned missing-data design, while two-thirds com-
pleted the SDQ (n = 194) about their child via the online survey software, SurveyMonkey. The
survey links were sent to kindergartens in Hong Kong and to directly recruited parents. Online
surveys have been found to yield more honest responses, save more time and cost compared to
traditional paper surveys, especially in health fields [44, 45]. Responses to all the items were
expressed on a 5-point balanced agreement scale (i.e., 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly
agree).
Before the final analysis of the surevy results, missing-value analysis removed participants
with >10% missing values and imputed values for the remaining missing using the expectation
maximization procedure [46]. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the fit of
the items to the intended factor structures of the CNI-PPC and the SDQ. Testing the fit of that
model directly was appropriate, rather than conducting exploratory factor analysis (EFA)
which presumes the items had zero face validity for the sub-scales of the CNI-PPC and the
SDQ [47, 48]. Unlike EFA, CFA forces all non-specified paths to be zero, thus simplifying the
data into, in this case, four factors with no paths from items to factors for which they were not
specified. CFA was extended to the SDQ to ensure that the results of previous studies were
applicable in this sample of Cantonese-speaking parents in Hong Kong.
Inspection of modification indices was used to identify poorly fitting items (e.g., low-
loading or strong cross-loading to other items or factors), while ensuring decisions were
conceptually valid. The fit of a CFA to the source data was determined by multiple indices,
using conventional standards for non-rejection: the ratio of χ2 to df should be statistically
not significant (p>.05), the gamma hat should be >.90, the root mean square of approxi-
mation (RMSEA), and the standardized root mean residual (SRMR) should be < .08 [49,
50].
To examine the relationships between the CNI-PPC and the SDQ, a general causal model
was proposed. Because the literature supports the notion that exposure to and connection to
nature is beneficial to well-being, we presumed that parent scores for the CNI-PPC would be
causally predictive of perceived strengths and difficulties. We hypothesised in general that
greater connectedness to nature would predict fewer difficulties and more strengths. To test
this, we used structural equation modelling (SEM) to test our hypothesis by introducing the
two CFA structures into a simultaneous set of linear regressions [47]. Evaluation of an SEM
follows the same principles outlined above for CFA.
3.2 Results
3.2.1 CNI-PPC measurement model.
The original model of four factors for the CNI-PPC
with 20 items did not meet conventional standards for acceptable fit (χ2 = 535.66; df = 164; χ2/
df = 3.27, p = .07; CFI = .88; gamma hat = .89; RMSEA = .087; SRMR = .067). Items were
trimmed from the model sequentially to ensure a simple structure. Modification indices indi-
cated that item 19 had strong paths to multiple items in all the other factors, item 14 had strong
paths to items in Responsibility toward Nature, item 11 was correlated with item 10, and item
16 had strong residual correlations with item 15. After this trimming, 16 items in four factors
(i.e., Enjoyment of Nature [ENN], Empathy for Nature [EMN], Responsibility toward Nature
[RN], and Awareness of Nature [AN]) had acceptable to good fit to the data (χ2 = 214.08;
df = 98; χ2/df = 2.18, p = .14; CFI = .95; gamma hat = .95; RMSEA = .063; SRMR = .046). These
four factors with retained items captured much of the original CNI’s four factors (Table 1),
albeit with more concrete and limited definitions in Empathy for Nature, Responsibility
toward Nature, and Awareness of Nature, making it more concrete and valid for the heavily
built environment of a big city.

 Consistent with the fit indices, the Cronbach α values for the CNI-PPC were sufficient
(Table 1), with three factors having α > .80, suggesting that factors had internal consistency.
The standardized effect sizes between the CNI-PPC factor means were large between AN and
SR in favour of AN (|d| = 1.02) and between ENN and SR in favour of ENN (|d| = 0.78), mod-
erate differences (.40<|d| < .60) existed between EMN and all other factors, while ENN and
AN had a small difference (|d| = .23).
3.2.2 SDQ Measurement model.
The five-factor model of SDQ consisted of correlated
constructs with each construct reflecting five items. Fit statistics for the original Goodman
five-factor model were acceptable (χ2 = 509.29; df = 265; χ2/df = 1.92, p = .17; CFI = .89;
gamma hat = .91; RMSEA = .07; SRMR = .063). However, removal of two items from Hyperac-
tivity produced an alternative trimmed model with good fit (χ2 = 402.06; df = 220; χ2/df = 1.83,
p = .18; CFI = .91; gamma hat = .93; RMSEA = .065; SRMR = .056). The trimmed model had
superior fit relative to the original model by a large margin (ΔAIC = 116.338) indicating it was
better to use this factor structure. All five subscales had acceptable alpha values ranging from
.70� α � .83 (Table 2).
It is noteworthy that the two deleted items (#21 and #25) both correctly had inverse load-
ings from the Hyperactivity factor (-.52 and -.66 respectively). However, these two items, per-
haps by being expressed in a positive way, did not associate purely with the negative construct
hyperactivity and violated simple structure expectations. This could be seen in the strong mod-
ification indices (MI) between item 21 and item 20 (MI = 17.05) within the prosocial factor

 and the residual of item 21 and that of the prosocial behaviour factor (MI = 18.56) and also
between the residual of item 25 and the residual of item 14 (MI = 10.65) in the peer problems
factor. The lack of a simple structure for these two items warranted their removal from further
analysis.
Inter-correlations among the SDQ factors were generally moderate (|M| = .62; range: -.69
� r � .74). Mean scores for three of the difficulties were below the mid-point of the response
scale, with the mean for hyperactivity quite close to the response scale maximum. Prosocial
strength was rated considerably higher. This suggests the participating students were largely
developing normally, rather than clinically problematic. A number of local Hong Kong studies
using the SDQ exist, but some methodological difficulties restricted comparability: the mean
age was usually higher, the assessors were not the parents of the children assessed, or the reli-
ability estimates of sub-scales were not satisfactory, ranging from .41 to .77, [51]. Considering
the above, we compared our results to the best matching studies [43, 52], and concluded that
the mean scores of our samples were relatively similar, except for the prosocial behaviour,
which was rated somewhat higher on our study (7.6 vs 6.7).

 values are in italics. Within the SDQ, the prosocial behaviour factor was negatively correlated
with the four other factors consistently, with an average inter-correlation of r = -.45. The other
SDQ factors had moderately positive inter-correlations, with an average of r = .46. Thus, the
scales functioned as relatively independent facets of strengths and difficulties. In contrast, the
within-construct inter-correlations in the CNI-PPC were stronger, with an average of r = .68.
In terms of between construct inter-correlations, the Prosocial behaviour had a moderate posi-
tive correlation with each of the CNI-PPC scales, with an average of r = .65. In contrast, the four
negative aspects of SDQ had a weaker but negative inter-correlation with the CNI-PPC factors
with an average of r = -.40. Together, these scale inter-correlation values suggest that each scale
provided sufficiently unique information so as to be warranted as a separate construct, and that
the prosocial strengths were positively correlated with connectedness to nature in contrast to the
SDQ difficulties scales. This provides convergent and divergent validation of the CNI-PPC.
Finally, to more robustly test the relations between the CNI-PPC and the SDQ, full-infor-
mation structural equation modelling was used. The literature reviewed has indicated that con-
nectedness to nature is positively associated with well-being. Hence, without suggesting
specific hypotheses about the relationship of the CNI-PPC factors to individual SDQ scales, we
propose that greater CNI-PPC ratings are positive predictors of strengths and negative predic-
tors of difficulties that parents report their children as having. Hence, the structural equation
model positions CNI-PPC factors as predictors of SDQ factors.
Given the relatively small sample (N = 194), the ratio of cases to variables becomes impor-
tant. Full-information modelling with all items for both the CNI-PPC and the SDQ inventories
involved 41 manifest variables giving a ratio of 4.73 cases per variable. This is close to the rec-
ommended threshold of 5:1 [53]. Because the SDQ scale scores involve summing all the con-
tributing items, it is feasible to reduce each scale to a parcelled variable that is the sum of items.
This approach would reduce complexity of the model to 22 items and give a ratio of 8.82:1
cases to variables.
Full-information latent traits and items were used for the CNI-PPC, while the SDQ was
modelled using factor-mean item parcels for each of the five SDQ scales and the total difficul-
ties score. To capture the inter-correlated nature of the SDQ scales, a superordinate latent trait
(SDQ) was introduced with a seed value placed on the prosocial strengths scale. Thus, the
overall SDQ latent factor had negative paths to all SDQ difficulties scale scores except for pro-
social behaviour. After removing all statistically non-significant paths, a well-fitting model was
found (χ2 = 333.59; df = 197; χ2/df = 1.69 (p = .19); CFI = .95; Gamma hat = .94; RMSEA =
.060 (90%CI = .049-.072; SRMR = .051) (Fig 1). Note that one item from the responsibility
toward nature scale was deleted because of its strong inter-correlation with another item
within the same scale; this deletion improved fit considerably (ΔAIC = 50.90).
All five of the SDQ scales were predicted by one of the four inter-correlated CNI-PPC fac-
tors. All, but Empathy for nature, of the CNI-PPC scales contributed to a more positive paren-
tal description of their child’s strengths and difficulties (Table 4). All CNI-PPC factors, except
Empathy for Nature, predicted fewer difficulties, while only Responsibility toward Nature pre-
dicted increases in the strength of Prosocial Behaviour. Responsibility toward Nature contrib-
uted strongly to decreasing Peer Problems, Conduct Problems, and Hyperactivity/Inattention,
while Enjoyment of Nature just contributed to a reduced total number of difficulties, and
Awareness of Nature reduced Emotional Problems. In all relationships, the CNI-PPC had a
stronger loading on the SDQ scale than the latent trait SDQ itself. The proportion of variance
explained by the two predictors for each of the SDQ scales was large. Together these paths sug-
gest that the CNI is a meaningful predictor of parental perceptions of the child’s strengths and
difficulties [54]. This suggests overall that the greater a child’s connectedness to nature was
perceived by their parent, the healthier the parent perceived the child being.

 4. Discussion
The aim of this study was to adapt and validate a multi-dimensional instrument for measuring
connectedness to nature in preschool children, living in a big city. The CNI-PPC was adapted
and validated in a parent-proxy study. The resulting 16-item scale is the first tool to measure
nature related attitudes and awareness for such a young population in the highly urbanised
context of a major Asian city. It captures CN across four major dimensions, including Enjoy-
ment of Nature, Empathy for Nature, Responsibility toward Nature and Awareness of Nature,
which demonstrates its reliability. Results suggest that child’s relationship to nature, through
parental perceptions, is most strongly characterized by Empathy for Nature, Enjoyment of
Nature, Awareness of Nature, and Responsibility toward Nature.
As shown in Table 3 and Fig 1, the CNI-PPC factor inter-correlations ranged from moder-
ate to high. This could be used to argue for treating the CNI-PPC as a single aggregate score
rather than as a multi-dimensional construct. However, the current results suggest that there is
more meaning to be found in allowing the separate factors to play a unique role. The paths
shown in Fig 1 clearly indicate that Responsibility toward Nature is the most influential aspect
of the CNI, with an almost universal prediction on all aspects of the SDQ. However, it is clear
that Enjoyment and Awareness of Nature have unique relations to the SDQ despite their corre-
lation with Responsibility toward Nature. Hence, we conclude at this stage of research, it
makes more sense to retain the separate factors.
The CNI-PPC tool described here may give a unique opportunity to measure and further
understand the relationship between connecting young children with nature and their psycho-
logical wellbeing. It is short, measures both affective and cognitive aspects of CN, and is based
on the children’s personal experiences (via parental-proxy) of nature in a big city.
4.1 Comparison of CNI-PPC to CNI
Nonetheless, the new factors do not perfectly correspond to the factors of the original CNI.
The differences appear to logically arise from the urban context of a big city and the younger
age of the target population. The new Enjoyment of Nature factor excludes the quasi-therapeu-
tic function of going into nature to combat sadness, but retains the original ideas of gaining

 joy by interacting with living things. The new Empathy for Nature retains strong elements of
emotional attachment to living things, but removes the personal sense of unity with nature.

 The new Awareness of Nature has none of the transcendental unity implied by ‘sense of one-
ness’, rather it instead focuses on noticing and paying attention to living things. This recasting
of “Oneness” as “Awareness” de-emphasises the possibility that any sense of self might be
involved in CN. This result is in accordance with Cheng and Monroe (2012), who pointed out
the difficulty of composing ‘self in nature’ items for nine-year olds [37].
Lastly, the Responsibility toward Nature factor restricts action to littering and tidiness,
rather than to making a difference to the natural world. This corresponds with the reflection
that very little is known about the concept of responsibility in young children, as children lack
the competence and experience to be responsible [55]. At the same time, Bjerke argues that
responsibility is not a static entity, ‘but a complex and rich practice embedded in relationship
with others in the sense that it is judged in relation to the actions and attitudes of others’ [55].
In his comprehensive study, three categories of responsibilities are described: personal respon-
sibility, social responsibility, and collective responsibility, all of which may be seen to be
reflected in our items. Deducing from the qualitative analysis of the individual interviews with
children, Bjerke suggests that “children will only learn to become responsible if they are given
opportunities to acquire experience and practice to be responsible” (p.73) [55] and are, there-
fore, in need of practice. Interestingly, the notion of personal responsibility seems to be linked
to children’s prosocial behaviour already in preschool and early school years, which is one of
the findings of external validations of the CNI [56]. However, the factor Responsibility toward
Nature is likely to be susceptible to social desirability bias in a parent-report survey and we
would like the readers and future users to be aware of this.
4.2 Convergent validity of the CNI-PPC
Our studies have confirmed the expectation that CN would be related to psychological func-
tioning and parental perceptions of children’s social and emotional well-being. This corre-
sponds with two recent reviews showing that outdoor nature spaces and activities interacting
with nature benefit both mental and physical health of human beings [57, 58]. In our study,
greater endorsement of the child’s enjoyment of, awareness of, and responsibility toward
nature resulted in reduced perceived behavioural difficulties. Finally, the more parents rated
their child as responsible for nature, the less hyperactivity, conduct, and peer problems were
perceived.
These relationships are entirely consistent with studies that have shown there is an associa-
tion between: (a) urban green space exposure and increased physical and emotional wellbeing
[59, 60], (b) a lack of urban green spaces in a child’s neighbourhood and increased mental
health and behavioural problems [33, 61], including increasing distance to urban green spaces
with greater hyperactivity/inattention and peer relationship problems, with the effect being
strongest for children residing in the inner city [62], (c) the use of green spaces and residential
surrounding greenness with fewer behavioural problems (similarly measured with the SDQ)
[61], and (d) a connectedness to nature score and greater life satisfaction and overall happiness
[7]. Clearly, greater access to nature is a challenge for families with younger children in any
urban setting. In such settings, where there may be relatively good access to minor green
spaces near residences, but relatively weak traditions of taking children into major green
spaces in the suburbs or outlying regions.
4.3 Significance of CNI-PPC
We believe this is the first instrument to measure CN at such a young age, which makes it
unique. Monitoring of child’s behaviour and early psychological development has a crucial

 role in paediatric care [63], because early identification of difficulties and intervention may
influence further reduction of difficulties and improve the quality of family lives [64, 65].
Measuring the relationship between individuals and the natural world is challenging, even
with adults. Measuring relationships with nature among pre-schoolers is even more complex,
requiring a different tool and methodology from those previously developed. Ideally, an
instrument would be simple enough for children who cannot read or write; however, this is
unlikely to be achieved for such children. Fortunately, parents are normally literate and are in
a position to give a good estimate of their child’s CN. Thus, assessment of CN among pre-
school children may be only possible through a child’s parents. To our knowledge, none of the
existing tools for measuring CN have been applied to pre-schoolers, the age when we believe it
is necessary to establish a baseline for any health-promoting interventions. We expect that this
instrument will be sensitive to changes over time, which will be one of the major advantages of
its application. Ultimately, the goal is to measure changes during any nature promoting inter-
ventions early in life, including how such changes affect lifestyle habits and health in general.
The knowledge gained from these investigations will inform future practice and provide valu-
able information on the best approaches to promote CN in children from preschool onwards.
Hence, the tool validated here fills the existing methodological gap, providing a simple possi-
bility to assess CN in young children in an urban population.
4.4 Future research
There are several limitations to the present study. Firstly, because of its exploratory design, the
causal modeling reported here cannot be proven because the data are correlational. However,
the model is based on a presumed directionality of relationship; that is, the modelling
approach assumes causality and models the relationships as causal [66]. Successful modelling,
thus, forms the grounds for future experimental studies that could prove the hypothesised rela-
tions seen in this study. Hence, to explore this, we are currently conducting a randomised,
controlled trial (RCT), collecting data objectively by measuring a number of health-related
outcomes crossed with location information (i.e., urban green spaces or otherwise). Further-
more, given the restriction of constructs in the model, it is not possible to determine whether
the observed effects might have arisen from a lagged association between CN and parents’ per-
ceived difficulties in children or some other influential variable such as socio-economic status
or a child’s individual conscientiousness. Additonally, it was not possible to control for paren-
tal psychopathology, parenting styles, or parental CN and these, in turn, may have influenced
the results. Nonetheless, the obtained sample size (n = 299) was large enough to detect linear
bivariate regressions of β = .20 with substantial power (α = .05; 1-β = .94) [67]. Hence, the cur-
rent results are not likely to be inaccurate estimates of population parameters. Social desirabil-
ity may inflate relationships between nature connectedness and psychological health. Future
research could examine the specific relationship between nature-related enjoyment, empathy,
and so on with psychological health, controlling for non-nature-related enjoyment, empathy,
et cetera. Finally, if interaction with nature is shown to have associations with cognitive and
affective outcomes, a potential benefit of a CN tool for young children is the ability to test if
interactions with nature are more/less beneficial for children with high/low CN. This would
support the creation of customised health promotion or landscape design interventions.
To estimate the practical research value of a new tool, an assessment of its use in other
urban settings should be undertaken. A further application of the tool would be to explore and
compare urban, suburban, and rural children including differences in how they perceive and
appreciate the natural environment surrounding them. A specific next step would be to inves-
tigate differences in the CN between children living in the inner city of Hong Kong compared

 to its surrounding areas. Such a study would build upon recent findings about the positive
effect of green spaces on the mental health of children being different between those living in
the outskirts of a city compared to those living in the inner city, as well as the role played by
the types of green spaces (open countryside, smaller parks) available to them [62]. Many inner
cities lack large open green spaces, and smaller parks/gardens would be expected to play a
more important role for urban families than for children living in the outskirts or rural areas,
where bigger green spaces are more prevalent.
The lack of CN measurement instruments for children of a young age does not allow us to
answer very important questions such as: Has psychological functioning in Hong Kong deteri-
orated over time in relation to disconnection from nature? Since when have children in Hong
Kong lived with little connection to nature? What type of ‘nature’ do Hong Kong children
wish/need to connect with? How has the loss of CN affected cultural and traditional practices
related to psychological functioning? Finding answers to these questions may elucidate some
plausible connections concering the psychological functioning of children in big cities like
Hong Kong.
It must also be noted that perceptions of CN seem to vary not only with age but also with
cultural context [68]. The present version of the CNI-PPC was developed for Hong Kong pre-
schoolers, though it could be potentially useful for children in other Chinese-speaking com-
munities (e.g., Macau, Taiwan, Guangzhou, etc.) and other urban settings worldwide. Being a
parental-proxy tool, the language may not be a barrier, and this short questionnaire could
potentially be adapted for use for non-Chinese-speaking children in other communities. How-
ever, more research is needed to examine the psychometric properties of the tools in Chinese-
speaking and English-speaking sample populations. The reliability of the culturally dependent
sub-scales should be further tested. Furthermore, cut-off scores should be developed, tested,
and standardized taking into account relevant demographic characteristics that might be asso-
ciated with SDQ scores.
5. Conclusion
To conclude, the CNI-PPI has proved to be a satisfactory psychometric tool in regard to its
internal consistency and its logically coherent convergence to and divergence from the dimen-
sions of the SDQ (i.e., positive to prosocial and negative to all other difficulty aspects). It is
likely to be a useful screening tool for paediatricians and early childhood educators in the iden-
tification of children who may need further help in their developmental status. Being a short
and user-friendly tool, it could also be a useful research tool for researchers working on child
cognitive development. It could potentially be used as a tool for the evaluation of early child-
hood intervention programmes designed to enhance children’s early development and well-
being.
