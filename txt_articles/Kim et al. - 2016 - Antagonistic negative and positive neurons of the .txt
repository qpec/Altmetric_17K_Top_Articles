Abstract
The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a site of convergence of negative and positive stimuli, and is 
critical for emotional behaviors and associations. However, the neural substrate for negative and 
positive behaviors and relationship between negative and positive representations in the basolateral 
amygdala is unknown. Here, we identified two genetically distinct, spatially segregated 
populations of excitatory neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) that participate in valence-
specific behaviors and are connected through mutual inhibition. These results identify a 
genetically-defined neural circuit for the antagonistic control of emotional behaviors and 
memories.
INTRODUCTION
The basolateral complex of the amygdala consists of two intimately juxtaposed nuclei—the 
lateral nucleus (LA) and basolateral nucleus (BLA)1, 2. The BLA is a cortical-like brain 
structure consisting of two-types of nonlaminarly organized excitatory pyramidal, 
magnocellular and parvocellular neurons segregated in the anterior and posterior BLA 
(aBLA, pBLA), intermingled with populations of genetically-defined interneurons1, 3–8. The 
BLA is activated by negative and positive emotional stimuli, and participates in emotional 
behaviors and associations9–16. Recent studies showed that BLA neurons drive opposing 
behaviors; therefore, the BLA may be a key site for the regulation of negative and positive

 behaviors9, 15. Despite the critical role of the BLA in emotional behaviors, it is not 
established whether the BLA pyramidal neurons that contributes to negative and positive 
behaviors (negative neurons and positive neurons) are structurally distinct, let alone, 
genetically distinguishable17, 18. Furthermore, a neural circuit subserving the antagonistic 
nature of emotional behaviors has yet to be identified.
Recent studies demonstrated that BLA neurons, which express the activity-dependent gene, 
c-Fos, during a negative or positive stimulus, were capable of driving a behavioral response 
consistent with the valence of the experience9, 15. Therefore, we reasoned that by utilizing a 
c-Fos-based genetic expression system, molecular profiles of the putative negative and 
positive neurons within the BLA can be obtained. Activity-dependent molecular profiles of 
BLA neurons may reveal genetic markers unique to negative and positive neurons. In turn, 
the identification of distinguishing genetic markers for negative and positive BLA neurons 
will provide a foundation for identifying the neural circuits underlying antagonistic 
behaviors elicited by negative and positive stimuli.
RESULTS
Identification of BLA Genetic Markers
Genetics-based RNA profiling strategies in mammalian models have involved ectopically 
expressing epitope-tagged RNA associated proteins or exploiting molecular modifications of 
RNA-associated substrates19–22. In order to obtain transcriptional profiles, we implemented 
a strategy involving ectopically expressing an epitope-tagged RNA binding protein, poly(A) 
binding protein with a c-terminus FLAG tag (PABP-FLAG)23. Two AAV9 constructs were 
used, one containing the tetracyclin-based transcription factor, tTA, under the control of the 
activity-dependent promoter of c-Fos (AAV9-c-Fos-tTA), and the other containing Pabp-flag 
under the control of the tetracycline response element TRE (AAV9-TRE-Pabp-flag). 
Activation of the c-Fos promoter drives the expression of tTA. In the absence of doxycycline 
(Dox), tTA binds TRE to induce the expression of PABP-FLAG. PABP-FLAG competes 
with endogenous PABP and bind the polyA tails of mRNA, which then can be isolated via 
immunoprecipiation using an anti-flag antibody and A/G coated magnetic beads (Fig. 1a).
The putative negative and positive neurons were targeted by exposing male mice to 
footshocks and a female mouse, respectively. AAV9-c-Fos-tTA and AAV9-TRE-Pabp-flag 
were introduced into the BLA in mice kept on a Dox diet. Once placed off a Dox diet for 2 
days, mice were exposed to footshocks or female mouse, then immediately placed back on a 
Dox diet for 2 days prior to sacrifice. A similar number of BLA neurons were FLAG+ in the 
shock and female groups, but were greater than mice that were kept in their home cages or 
kept on a Dox diet (Fig. 1b,c,d,e,g–j). In contrast, a greater number of BLA neurons were 
FLAG+ in the mice that underwent kainic acid-induced seizures compare to the shock or 
female group (Fig. 1b,f–j). This affirms the activity-dependency of the genetic system. 
Therefore, RNA immunoprecipitation using antibodies against FLAG was performed from 
the shock and female group. Isolated RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA and underwent 
microarray analysis using Affymetric Mouse 430A chip. After RMA or MAS5 
normalization (see Methods), differential gene expression profiles were compared between 
the shock and female group and were used as the basis of the screen for identifying genetic

 markers for the putative negative and positive neurons of the BLA (Fig. 1k, Supplemental 
Fig. 1).
Based on previous observations9, 15, we hypothesized that the putative negative and positive 
BLA neurons would be non-overlapping; therefore, we sought to select from our potential 
list of candidate genetic markers a single gene candidate, one for each of the putative 
negative and positive neuron populations. As a corollary, this posits that each of the gene 
markers would label a subpopulation (<100%) of BLA principle neurons. First, independent 
of statistical significance, hundreds of genes whose expression was enriched in the shock 
and female groups were individually screened on Allen Mouse Brain Atlas24. 37 genes were 
selected for single label fluorescent in situ hybridization, of which, 16 probes yielded a 
quantifiable signals in the −1.0 to −1.6 anterior-posterior (AP) plane of the BLA 
(Supplemental Fig 2). Quantification of gene expression in the BLA revealed that the 
majority of these candidate genes were expressed in a virtually all BLA neurons (Fig. 1l, 
Supplemental Fig. 2). Rspo2 (R-spondin 2) was enriched in the shock group (Fig. 1k) and 
was expressed in less than 100% of BLA neurons (Fig. 1l). Furthermore, Rspo2 expression 
was specific to the BLA, with little expression in other brain areas. In fact, because of this 
BLA-specific expression, we had previously generated a BLA-restricted Cre transgenic 
mouse line using the Rspo2 gene promotor, although we had not further characterized this 
transgenic mouse with respect to more detailed expression pattern of the Cre expression 
within the BLA, nor examined the role of Rspo2-expressing BLA neurons in valence-related 
behavior. Therefore, Rspo2 was selected as a candidate for a negative BLA neuron marker 
for further anatomical and functional studies of negative BLA neurons. Rspo2+ BLA 
neurons labeled less than 100%, but greater than 50%, of BLA neurons. Among the 
candidate genes belonging to the female group, Ppp1r1b (protein phosphatase 1 regulatory 
inhibitor subunit 1B, which encoded for DARPP-3225) was the only gene that labeled less 
than 50% of BLA neurons. Furthermore, based on the distribution pattern of Rpso2 and 
Ppp1r1b, it appeared that these two markers may be expressed in neurons that are non-
overlapping. Therefore, we selected Ppp1r1b as a potential marker for positive BLA neurons 
for further characterization.
Double label single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) and quantification 
across the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the BLA (−0.8 to −2.8mm from bregma) revealed 
that Rspo2 and Ppp1r1b labeled spatially segregated population of neurons (Fig. 2a–c). Less 
than 1% of BLA neurons were Rspo2+Ppp1r1b+ (Table 1). Rspo2+ and Ppp1r1b+ BLA 
neurons are co-labelled with the pyramidal neurons marker, Camk2a, and non-overlapping 
with the inhibitory neuron marker, Gad1 (Fig. 2d–g, Table 1). Rspo2+ neurons correspond to 
magnocellular pyramidal neurons in the anterior BLA (aBLA). In contrast, Ppp1r1b+ 
neurons correspond to the parvocellular pyramidal neurons or posterior BLA (pBLA)1, 26. 
Double smFISH with a Camk2a probe and the combined probes of both the Rspo2 and 
Ppp1r1b showed that virtually all Camk2a+ BLA neurons express either Rspo2 or Ppp1r1b 
(Table 1, Supplemental Fig. 3). Therefore, Rpso2+ and Ppp1r1b+ neurons collectively define 
the entirety of BLA pyramidal neurons.
The electrophysiological and morphological properties of Rspo2+ and Ppp1r1b+ neurons 
were examined using patch clamp recordings. Rspo2+ and Ppp1r1b+ were targeted by

 patching magnocellular and parvocellular BLA neurons (Fig. 2h). To ascertain genetic 
identity, Rspo2+ and Ppp1r1b+ neurons were identified by the use of single-cell quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) from cytoplasmic harvest of patch clamped recorded 
BLA neurons. Of 37 magnocellular neurons, single cell qPCR yielded 10 Rpso2+ and 0 
Ppp1r1b+ neurons; of 38 parvocellular neurons, single cell qPCR yielded 0 Rpso2+ and 11 
Ppp1r1b+ neurons (Fig. 2i). Soma diameter was larger in Rspo2+ neurons than Ppp1r1b+ 
neurons; membrane resistance was smaller in Rspo2+ neurons than Ppp1r1b+ neurons; 
membrane capacitance was larger in Rspo2+ neurons than Ppp1r1b+ neurons (Fig. 2j,k). 
qPCR-confirmed Rspo2+ and Ppp1r1b+ neurons were not significantly different from 
unconfirmed magnocellular and parvocellular neurons, respectively (Table1). Taken 
together, Rpso2+ and Ppp1r1b+ BLA neurons defined spatially segregated, genetically, 
morphologically, and electrophysiological distinct cell-types.
BLA Activation by Valence-Specific Stimuli
If Rspo2+ and Ppp1r1b+ neurons represent negative and positive neurons of the BLA, 
respectively, then stimuli that elicit valence-specific behaviors may differentially activate the 
aBLA and pBLA. Mice were exposed to the stimuli used to identify BLA gene markers–
shocks or female mice—and were sacrificed 90 minutes later. c-Fos+ neurons were 
quantified sepearately in the aBLA and pBLA (defined by cytoarchitectural boundaries) by 
measuring the total number of c-Fos + neurons per section at intervals across the AP axis 
(Fig. 3a–c, Supplemental Fig. 4). The relative c-Fos expression, measured by the number of 
c-Fos + neurons in the aBLA or pBLA as a percentage of total c-Fos + BLA neurons, was 
significantly greater in the aBLA in response to footshocks compared to exposure to a 
female mice or control mice, which received no stimulus in a context (Fig. 3d). Conversely, 
relative c-Fos expression was significantly greater in the pBLA in response to female mice 
compared to exposure shock or control, which were exposed to a neutral context (Fig. 3d). 
In response to valence-specific olfactory stimuli—2,3,5-Trimethyl-3-thiazoline (TMT), or 
peanut oil—relative c-Fos expression was significantly greater in the aBLA in response to 
TMT compared to exposure to a neutral odor benzaldehyde (BA) or peanut oil, while 
relative c-Fos expression was significantly greater in the pBLA in response to peanut oil 
compared to exposure to a BA or TMT (Fig. 3e). In response to valence-specific gustatory 
stimuli —quinine (bitter), water, sucrose (sweet)—relative c-Fos expression was 
significantly greater in the pBLA in response to water and sucrose water compared to mice 
that received no water or quinine water (Fig. 3f). In contrast, no significant difference was 
observed in relative c-Fos expression between exposure to quinine water (which did not 
elicit much water drinking) compared to no water, as well as between sucrose water and 
water (Fig. 3f). Overall, the aBLA is recruited by stimuli that elicits negative behaviors 
(shocks, TMT), while the pBLA is recruited by stimuli that elicits positive behaviors 
(female, water, sucrose, peanut oil).
Double smFISH was performed to directly assess the expression of c-Fos in Rspo2+ or 
Ppp1r1b+ BLA neurons in response to valence-specific stimuli (stimuli that will be used in 
subsequent behavioral experiments). Shocks significantly increased c-Fos expression in 
Rspo2+ (Fig. 3g, k), but not in Ppp1r1b+ neurons (Fig. 3h, l), compared to context (Fig. 3g, 
h, m, n). In contrast, administration of water significantly increased c-Fos expression in

 Ppp1r1b+ (Fig. 3j,p), but not in Rspo2+ neurons (Fig. 3i,o), compared no water (Fig. 3i,j,q,r). 
This shock-specific activation of Rspo2+ aBLA cells and water-specific activation of 
Ppp1r1b+ pBLA cells were confirmed by further analyses of A/P axis planes within aBLA 
and pBLA, respectively (Supplemental Fig. 5). However, these analyses also revealed some 
heterogeneity of Rspo2+ neurons activated by shock within aBLA and Ppp1r1b+ neurons 
activated by water within pBLA, relative to the neutral stimuli (Supplemental Fig. 5): 
Rspo2+ cells activated specifically by shock and Ppp1r1b+ neurons activated specifically by 
water were more distributed posteriorly within aBLA and pBLA, respectively (Supplemental 
Fig. 5). Nevertheless, these data suggest that negative and positive information is represented 
by genetically-defined populations of neurons in the BLA that are spatially segregated; 
Rspo2+ neurons, which predominates in the aBLA, represent negative valence, while 
Ppp1r1b+ neurons, which predominates in the pBLA, represent positive valence.
BLA in Valence-Specific Behaviors
Valence-specific activation of Rpso2+ and Ppp1r1b+ neurons posits that these populations 
may be necessary for valence-specific behaviors; therefore, the effects of inhibiting these 
BLA populations were performed in a fear and reward conditioning paradigm. Rspo2+ and 
Ppp1r1b+ neurons were genetically targeted using Rspo2-Cre and Cartpt-Cre mice, 
respectively. Ppp1r1b+ BLA neurons are accessible by Carpt-Cre mice (Supplemental Fig. 
6), and hereafter, virus-injected Cartpt-Cre mice will be referred to using “Ppp1r1b”. Light-
activated inhibitory ion channel, eArch3.0, was expressed in Rspo2+ (Rspo2-Arch) and 
Ppp1r1b+ (Ppp1r1b-Arch) BLA neurons using a Cre-dependent viral vector (AAV5-EF1α-
DIO-eArch3.0-eYFP) bilaterally targeted to the BLA of Rspo2-Cre and Cartpt-Cre mice, 
respectively. Control mice (Rspo2-eYFP, Ppp1r1b-eYFP) received a viral vector lacking 
eArch3.0, (AAV5-EF1α-DIO-eYFP) (Fig. 4a,1,m, Supplemental Fig. 7).
On day 1 of contextual fear conditioning, mice received green light, bilaterally targeted to 
the BLA, during footshocks (Fig. 4b). Rspo2-Arch mice displayed reduced levels of freezing 
in response to footshocks compared with Rspo2-eYFP mice. Ppp1r1b-Arch mice displayed 
similar levels of freezing compared to Ppp1r1b-eYFP mice. On day 2, mice were tested in 
the context without shock or light stimulation. Reduction of freezing was observed in 
Rspo2-Arch mice compared to Rspo2-GFP mice, while, similar levels of freezing was 
observed in Ppp1r1b-Arch mice compared to Ppp1r1b-eYFP mice (Fig. 4c). Thus, Rspo2+, 
but not Ppp1r1bp+, BLA neuronal activity is critical for freezing to shock stimuli and for the 
association of a context to freezing behavior.
Reward conditioning took place in an operant conditioning chamber, where water was 
dispensed contingent on a nose poke following an external light cue (Fig. 4d). Green light 
was bilaterally delivered into the BLA simultaneously with the presentation of water. Rspo2-
Arch and Rspo2-eYFP mice displayed similar levels of nose pokes and cue-reward 
association (z-score of time spent in the reward port during cue period, see Methods). In 
contrast, Ppp1r1b-Arch mice displayed reduced levels of nose pokes and cue-reward 
association compared to Ppp1r1b-eYFP mice (Fig. 4e). Thus, Ppp1r1b +, but not Rpso2+, 
BLA neuronal activity is critical for reward-seeking behavior and for the association of a 
conditioned stimulus to appetitive behavior.

 Next, the effects of activating these BLA neurons were assessed. Light-activated excitatory 
ion channel, ChR2, was expressed in Rspo2+ (Rspo2-ChR2) and Ppp1r1b+ (Ppp1r1b-ChR2) 
BLA neurons using a Cre-dependent viral vector (AAV5-EF1α-DIO-ChR2-eYFP) 
unilaterally targeted to the BLA of Rspo2-Cre and Cartpt-Cre mice, respectively. Control 
mice (Rspo2-eYFP, Ppp1r1b-eYFP) received a viral vector lacking ChR2, (AAV5-EF1α-
DIO-eYFP) (Fig. 4a,n,o).
On day 1 of the optogenetic freezing test, mice were placed in a neutral context while 
receiving blue light stimulation (Fig. 4f, see methods). Rspo2-ChR2 mice displayed greater 
levels of freezing compared to Rspo2-eYFP mice, while Ppp1r1rb-ChR2 and Ppp1r1b-eYFP 
mice displayed similar levels of freezing (Fig. 4g). On day 2, mice were returned to the 
context and freezing was measured without shock. Rspo2-ChR2 mice displayed greater 
levels of freezing compared to Rspo2-eYFP mice, while Ppp1r1rb-ChR2 and Ppp1r1b-eYFP 
mice displayed similar levels of freezing (Fig. 4g). Thus, Rspo2+, but not Ppp1r1b+, BLA 
neurons are capable of eliciting freezing, which can be conditioned to a neutral context.
On day 1 of the optogenetic self-stimulation test, mice were placed in an operant 
conditioning chamber in which blue light stimulation was administered when poking into a 
nose port (Fig. 4h). Ppp1r1b-ChR2 mice displayed greater number of pokes compared to 
Ppp1r1b-eYFP mice, while Rspo2-ChR2 and Rpso2-eYFP mice displayed similar number of 
pokes. On day 2, mice were returned to the operant condition chamber in which no light 
stimulation was delivered. Ppp1r1b-ChR2 mice displayed greater number of pokes 
compared to Ppp1r1b-eYFP mice, while Rspo2-ChR2 and Rspo2-eYFP mice displayed 
similar number of pokes (Fig. 4i). Thus, Ppp1r1b+, but not Rspo2+, BLA neurons are 
capable of eliciting self-stimulation and support reward conditioning.
In real-time optogenetic place preference test (Fig. 4j), Rspo2-ChR2 mice spent less time in 
the light-stimulated side compared to corresponding controls, while Ppp1r1b-ChR2 mice 
spent more time in the light-stimulated side compared to corresponding controls (Fig. 4k). 
Therefore, Rspo2+ BLA neurons are sufficient to elicit place aversion while Ppp1r1b+ BLA 
neurons are capable of eliciting place preference.
Antagonism between negative and positive BLA neurons
Rpso2+ and Ppp1r1b+ neurons drive opposing behaviors; therefore, we examined whether 
these two types of neurons contribute to the antagonistic control of emotional behaviors and 
memories. For this purpose, we examined the behavioral effects of optogenetically activating 
Rpso2+ or Ppp1r1b+ neurons during the presence of valence-specific stimuli. On day 1 of 
contextual fear conditioning, ChR2-expressing mice received bilateral blue light stimulation 
in the BLA during footshocks (Fig. 5a). Rspo2-ChR2 and Rspo2-eYFP mice displayed 
similar levels of freezing in response to footshocks, while Ppp1r1b-ChR2 mice displayed 
lower levels of freezing than Ppp1r1b-eYFP mice (Fig. 5b,c). On day 2, conditioned freezing 
was assessed by returning mice to the context without footshock or light stimulation. Similar 
to day 1, no difference in freezing was observed between Rspo2-ChR2 and Rspo2-eYFP 
mice, while less freezing was observed in Ppp1r1b-ChR2 mice compared Ppp1r1b-eYFP 
mice (Fig.5b,c). Thus, activation of Ppp1r1b+ BLA neurons is capable of disrupting freezing 
to footshocks and the association of a conditioned contextual stimulus with footshocks.

 In reward conditioning, ChR2-expressing mice received blue light stimulation during reward 
delivery (Fig. 5d). Rspo2-ChR2 displayed reduced levels of nose pokes and cue-reward 
association compared to Rspo2-eYFP mice, while Ppp1r1b-ChR2 and Ppp1r1bp-eYFP mice 
displayed similar levels of nose pokes and cue-reward association (Fig. 5e,f). Thus, 
activation of Rspo2 + BLA neurons is capable of disrupting reward-seeking behaviors and 
the association of a conditioned stimulus with a reward.
Although Rpso2+ and Ppp1r1b+ neurons antagonize behaviors elicited by stimuli of the 
opposing valence, behavioral antagonism may be result of interference by downstream 
circuits rather than by direct interactions between these two neuronal populations. Therefore, 
the effect of optogenetic activation of one of the two neuronal populations on the activation 
of the other in response to valence-specific stimuli was measured using c-Fos. In Ppp1r1b-
ChR2 mice, which received blue light stimulation in the presence of footshocks, c-Fos was 
increased in Ppp1r1b+ neurons and decreased in Rpso2+ neurons compared to Ppp1r1b-
eYFP mice (Fig. 5g,h,i). In water-deprived Rspo2-ChR2 mice, which received blue light 
stimulation during the consumption of water, c-Fos was increased in Rspo2+ neurons and 
decreased in Ppp1r1b+ neurons compared to Rspo2-eYFP mice (Fig 5j,k,l). Thus, Ppp1r1b+ 
and Rpso2+ neurons are capable of reducing the activity elicited by valence-specific stimuli 
in the opposite neuronal population.
Antagonism observed at the behavioral and c-Fos activation level of valence-specific BLA 
neurons was further examined at the microcircuit level by combining patch clamp recording 
with optogenetic stimulation of valence-specific neurons. The functional relationship 
between Rspo2+ and Ppp1r1b+ neurons were examined by combining patch clamp 
recordings with optogenetic stimulation of cell type-specific axons (Fig. 6a–d). Patch clamp 
recordings of Rspo2+ and Ppp1r1b+ neurons revealed distinct intrinsic physiological 
properties (Table 1). Therefore, the postsynaptic cell target was recognized based on a 
combination of anatomical position, soma size, and intrinsic electrophysiological properties 
(Fig. 6m,n). Electrophysiological recordings of Rspo2+ neurons in response to optogenetic 
stimulation of Ppp1r1b-ChR2+ fibers and recordings of Ppp1r1b+ neurons in response to 
stimulation of Rspo2-ChR2+ fibers resulted in inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) 
(Fig. 6e–h,k,l). The probability of connections of Rpso2+ to Ppp1r1b+and vice versa were 
100% and 100% inhibitory, respectively (Fig. 6i,j), of which 25% of connections of 
Ppp1r1b+ to Rpso2+BLA neurons and 17% of connections of Rpso2+to Ppp1r1b+were both 
inhibitory and excitatory (Fig. 6i,j). These data suggest that these two populations interact 
predominantly through mutual inhibition.
Projections from negative and positive BLA neurons
The distinct projection targets of the Rspo2+ and Ppp1r1b+ neurons may reveal divergent 
brain structures that mediate negative and positive behaviors. Therefore, retrograde tracing 
from putative projection targets was examined using cholera toxin subunit b (CTB). CTB 
targeted to the capsular nucleus of the central amygdala (CeC), revealed CTB+ neurons 
primarily in the aBLA (Fig. 7a,c,d). CTB targeted to the lateral/medial nucleus of the central 
amygdala (CeL/CeM), resulted in CTB+ neurons distributed along the lateral side of the 
pBLA (Fig. 7a,e,f). CTB targeted to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), resulted in CTB+

 neurons distributed along the medial side of the BLA, spanning the posterior end of the 
aBLA to the posterior end of the pBLA (Fig. 7a,g,h). Dual-labelled CTB targeted to the 
prelimbic (PL) and inframlimbic (IL) cortex resulted in spatially segregated distribution of 
CTB+ neurons in the BLA—PL-CTB+ neurons primarily in the aBLA, IL-CTB+ neurons 
primarily in the pBLA (Fig. 7b,i,j). smFISH of Rspo2 or Ppp1r1b probe in CTB injected 
mice, revealed that CeC-CTB+ BLA neurons are 96% Rpso2+ and 4% Ppp1r1b+; CeL/CeM-
CTB+ neurons are 6% Rspo2+ and 94% Ppp1r1b+; NAc CTB+ neurons are 30% Rpso2+ and 
70% Ppp1r1b+ (Fig. 7k–n, Supplemental Fig. 8, Table 1).
For anterograde characterization, ChR2-eYFP+ fibers in Rspo2-ChR2 and Ppp1r1b-ChR2 
mice was examined. In Rspo2-ChR2 mice, dense fibers were found in the CeC, NAc, PL, 
but not in the CeL, CeM, or IL (Fig. 7o). In Ppp1r1b-ChR2 mice, dense fibers were found in 
the CeL, CeM, NAc, and IL but not in the CeC or PL (Fig. 7p). Together, CTB retrograde 
tracing and anterograde characterization of projection fibers suggest that Rspo2+ distinctly 
project to the CeC and PL, Ppp1r1b+ neurons distinctly project to the CeL, CeM, and IL, 
while both Rspo2+ and Ppp1r1b+ BLA neurons both project to the NAc.
DISCUSSION
Here, we employed a forward genetic strategy in order to transcriptionally profile active 
neurons in BLA. This approach revealed genetic markers for distinct populations of BLA 
neurons and was predictive of neuronal function. Rspo2+ BLA neurons are activated by 
stimuli that elicit negative behaviors, while Ppp1r1b+ BLA neurons are activated by stimuli 
that elicit positive behaviors. Rspo2+ BLA neurons are crucial for negative behaviors and 
associations, while Ppp1r1b+ BLA neurons are crucial for positive behaviors and 
associations. Rspo2+ and Ppp1r1b+ neurons are antagonistic at the behavioral, neuronal 
population, and electrophysiological levels. They not only drive opposing behaviors, but also 
antagonize valence-specific behaviors, antagonize the overall activation of the opposing 
neurons and interact through reciprocal feedforward inhibition. Collectively, these results 
support a model in which mutually inhibitory Rspo2+ and Ppplr1b+ neurons are the principle 
neurons that represent and elicit negative and positive behaviors, respectively.
Previous inactivation studies have implicated a greater contribution of the aBLA in 
contextual fear conditioning12, and the pBLA in reward conditioning27. Here, we 
dissociated, using specific genetic markers for cell-type specific manipulations, the aBLA 
and pBLA in negative and positive behaviors, respectively. Although Rpso2+ and Ppp1r1b+ 
neurons constitute virtually all BLA pyramidal neurons, there may be further functional, 
genetic, and or structural diversity within each of these two cell-types. Other genetic markers 
found as candidates on our screen were not further pursued in this study, but further studies 
could be performed to examine the role of other genetically distinct BLA neurons, and these 
studies may reveal functionally distinct subsets of neurons within Rspo2+ negative neurons 
or within Ppp1r1b+ positive neurons. However, from the examination of Rpso2+ and 
Ppp1r1b+ neurons in a set of behavioral assays (Fig. 4), we found no evidence suggesting 
that Rspo2+ and Ppp1r1b+ neurons participate in behaviors or associations across valence. 
Together, these findings add to the growing evidence of the spatially segregated 
representation of negative and positive information in the brain, as demonstrated in the

neurons in Drosophila31, 32. Thus, spatially segregated representation of negative and 
positive information may be a common motif throughout the central nervous system and 
across invertebrate and vertebrate species.
Previous in vivo electrophysiology and stimulus-dependent studies suggested that negative 
and positive BLA neurons may be intermingled15, 16. However, our results suggest that 
negative and positive neurons are spatially segregated into the aBLA and pBLA, 
respectively. At the transition between the aBLA and pBLA, these two types of neurons can 
be considered intermingled; however, examination of the entire BLA showed that Rspo2 and 
Ppp1r1b are spatially segregated in the BLA and define what has previously been defined as 
the anterior and posterior subfields of the BLA and correspond to magnocellular and 
parvocellular neurons, respectively4.
The identification of a mutually inhibitory microcircuit between negative and positive 
neurons suggests that the BLA is a key site for the antagonistic control of affective 
emotional states and emotional memories. The antagonistic BLA circuit provides a circuit 
mechanism of representing and associating a continuous range of negative and positive 
information based on the balance of excitation between these two populations. Studies have 
correlated negative affective states with elevated excitability in the BLA33, 34, which suggest 
that the imbalance of excitation between negative and positive BLA neurons may be an 
underlying mechanism in emotional disorders. Therefore, the identification of distinct 
molecular markers for neurons that participate in an antagonistic circuit provides an avenue 
for more precise cellular and pharmacological targeting for the treatment of disease in 
addition to genetic models for further elucidation of the circuitry and mechanisms 
underlying emotional behavior and memories.
Previous studies have targeted BLA neurons for the study of negative and positive behaviors 
using projection target-based criteria18. These studies suggested that nucleus accumbens 
(NAc) projections may be a defining feature of positive BLA neurons18. However, 
retrograde and anterograde projection experiments showed that ~30% of BLA neurons that 
project to NAc, are Rspo2+ BLA neurons. Furthermore, stimulation of Rpso2+ somas or 
their NAc projections resulted in negative behaviors (Supplemental Fig.9). These findings 
demonstrate that such a projection-based definition is insufficient for distinguishing negative 
and positive BLA neurons34. Previous observations that BLA to NAc projections mediate 
positive behaviors8,16 are likely due to the observation that a larger proportion of NAc-
projecting BLA neurons are Ppp1r1b+ (Table 1).
It is widely thought that the amygdala fear circuit involves direct transmission of negative 
information from BLA principle neurons to CeL neurons and/or effector neurons in the 
CeM18, 35–38. Contrary to these previous hypotheses, our data suggest that positive, but not 
negative BLA neurons project to the CeM and CeL, while negative, but not positive BLA 
neurons, project to the CeC. Here, previous projection-based definition of BLA neurons—
namely that the neurons projecting directly to the CeM drive negative behavior18, 35–38—is 
not supported by our findings. In regards to CeM and CeL projections, our findings are 
consistent with anatomical studies demonstrating that parvocellular BLA neurons (which are

 Ppp1r1b+) send strong projections to the CeL and CeM and provide further support for the 
role of the central amygdala in appetitive behaviors26, 39–43. In regards to connections from 
negative BLA neurons to effector neurons in the CeM, our findings suggest that this may be 
an indirect route through the CeC. A recent study identified a population of Calcrl+ neurons 
in the CeC/CeL, which supports similar negative behaviors as Rpso2+ BLA neurons, and, 
thus, may be an intermediate between negative BLA neurons and the putative CeM effector 
neurons44.
Overall, the identification of genetic markers for distinct populations of BLA neurons has 
permitted the functional and anatomical dissociation of the circuit underlying negative and 
positive behaviors, in turn, providing a revised functional and structural model of the BLA 
(Supplemental Fig. 10).

 Figure 6. Rspo2+ and Ppp1r1b+ BLA neurons establish reciprocal inhibitory connections
a,b, Scheme for the experimental setup for recording in magnocellular (Rspo2+) (a) and 
parvocellular (Ppp1r1b+) (b) neurons, while stimulating Ppp1r1b+ (Ppp1r1b-ChR2 mice) 
and Rpso2+ (Rspo2-ChR2 mice) neurons, respectively. c,d, Sagittal view of biocytin-filled 
Rspo2+ BLA neurons in Ppp1r1b-ChR2 mice (c) and Ppp1r1b+ BLA neurons in Rspo2-
ChR2 mice (d). Scale bar 200μm, inset: 50 μm (c,d). AsterisksA denotes the 
electrophysiological traces in e and f.f Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPsP) recorded 
in Rspo2+ (e) and Ppp1r1b+ (f) BLA neurons by 10Hz optogenetic stimulation of Ppp1r1b-
ChR2 (e) and Rspo2-ChR2 (f) fibers. Green.G (e) and red (f) traces represent average trace 
of 20 sweeps recorded during periods without spikes. Inhibitory postsynaptic currents 
(IPSCs) recorded in Rpso2+ (magnocellular) (g) and Ppp1r1b+ (parvocellular) (h) BLA 
neurons (clamped at 0 mV) in response to optogenetic stimulation (10Hz train) of Ppp1r1b-
ChR2 (g) and Rspo2-ChR2 (h) fibers. Currents are blocked by bath application of gabazine 
(GBZ, 10 μM), insets: IPSCs amplitude before (GBZ-) and after GBZ (GBZ+) application

*P < 0.05. Probability of connection, Ppp1r1b+ to Rspo2+ connection (i) and Rspo2+ to 
Ppp1r1b+ connection (j). The two groups interact predominately by mutual inhibition rather 
than excitation, Fisher exact test, ***P <0.001 (i,j). IPSC onset in Rspo2+ (green) and 
Ppp1r1b+ (red) neurons were similar (k). IPSC amplitude was greater in Ppp1r1b+ (red) than 
in Rspo2+ (green) neurons (l), unpaired t-test *P<0.05. Recorded magnocellular (green) and 
parvocellular (red) neurons were confirmed using soma diameter and anatomical position 
(m); membrane resistance (Rm) and membrane capacitance (Cm) (n). Rspo2+ and Ppp1r1b+ 
cells were statistically distinct in all four parameters and consistent with values characterized 
in Fig. 2, significance for unpaired t-test *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ****P<0.0001 (n, m). Results 
show mean ± s.e.m (g,h,,k,l). Color scheme corresponds to the neurons recorded or virus-
infected transgenic mouse, Rpso2+ neurons or Rpso2-Cre (green) and Ppp1r1b+ neurons or 
Cartpt-Cre (red) (a–n).

Genetic, anatomical, morphological, and electrophysiological characterization of BLA neurons
(a) smFISH quantification of Rpso2 and Ppp1r1b expression in the BLA, Rpso2 and Ppp1r1b colocalization with Gad1 in the BLA, combined probes of 
Rpso2 and Ppp1r1b and their colocalization with Camk2a in the BLA, Rpso2 and Ppp1r1b colocalization with CTB injected mice (CeC, CeL/M, and 
NAc), cell counts corresponds to the total number of neurons counted in n animals. (b) Rpso2+ and Ppp1r1b+ BLA neurons correspond to magnocellular 
and parvocellular BLA neurons. Quantification of morphological (soma diameter) and electrophysiological properties (resting membrane potential (Vm), 
membrane resistance (Rm), capacitance (Cm), spike threshold, and rheobase) of qPCR-unconfirmed magnocellular, parvocellular, and qPCR-confirmed 
Rpso2+ and Ppp1r1b+ BLA neurons, p-values for unpaired t-test for comparisons, n corresponds to the number of neurons from at least 3 mice per group.
