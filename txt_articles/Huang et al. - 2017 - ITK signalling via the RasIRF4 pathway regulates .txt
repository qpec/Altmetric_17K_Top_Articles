ITK signalling via the Ras/IRF4 pathway regulates
the development and function of Tr1 cells
Weishan Huang1,2, Sabrina Solouki2, Nicholas Koylass2, Song-Guo Zheng1,3 & Avery August2
Type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells differentiate in response to signals engaging the Tcell receptor
(TCR), express high levels of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10, but not Foxp3, and can
suppress inflammation and promote immune tolerance. Here we show that ITK, an important
modulator of TCR signalling, is required for the TCR-induced development of Tr1 cells in
various organs, and in the mucosal system during parasitic and viral infections. ITK kinase
activity is required for mouse and human Tr1 cell differentiation. Tr1 cell development and
suppressive function of Itk deficient cells can be restored by the expression of the tran-
scription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4). Downstream of ITK, Ras activity is
responsible for Tr1 cell induction, as expression of constitutively active HRas rescues IRF4
expression and Tr1 cell differentiation in Itk � / � cells. We conclude that TCR/ITK signalling
through the Ras/IRF4 pathway is required for functional development of Tr1 cells.

 T
regulatory (Treg) cells promote immune tolerance and
suppress inflammation1,2. Unlike Treg cells that stably
express the transcription factor Foxp3, type 1 regulatory T
(Tr1) cells have no or transient expression of Foxp3; however,
they produce high levels of IL-10 and can suppress effector cell
responses in an IL-10 dependent manner1,3, via CTLA-4 and
PD-1 interactions, or by directly killing pro-inflammatory cells
with granzymes2,4. In mice and in humans, induction of antigenic
tolerance during haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and
specific-antigen immunotherapy are positively correlated with the
abundance of Tr1 cells5,6, and Tr1 cells can prevent allergic
asthma induced by the house dust mite peptidase 1 variant Derp
1 in murine models7, and prevent the development of bacterial-
induced atopic dermatitis8. Thus, like Foxp3 þ
Treg cells,
Foxp3 �IL-10 þ
Tr1
cells
have
therapeutic
potential
for
inflammatory diseases. Although much is known about the
development and function of Treg cells, substantially less is
known
about
Tr1
cells.
A
better
understanding
of
the
development and function of Tr1 cells should provide a wider
array of therapeutic options for inflammatory diseases.
IL-2 inducible T cell kinase (ITK) is a Tec family non-receptor
tyrosine kinase expressed by T cells, and has a pivotal role
downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR); the loss of ITK function
leads to attenuated TCR signalling and alters the T cell subset
differentiation
and
function9.
Naive
CD4 þ
T
cells
can
differentiate into Tr1 cells upon TCR engagement in the
presence of IL-27, and although Tr1 cells can express IFN-g,
production of IFN-g or T-bet are not required for Tr1 cell
development10. Alternatively, Tr1 cells can result from Th17
trans-differentiation during the resolution of inflammation11.
These findings suggest that Tr1 cell differentiation may share
some
pathways
of
regulation
with
Th1
and
Th17
cell
development. In mice with ITK deficiency, naive CD4 þ T cells
have defects in the differentiation of Th17 cells12, and enhanced
Th1 differentiation with impaired Th2 and Th9 programming
that leads to attenuated allergic asthma13–15, and have enhanced
differentiation of Foxp3 þ Treg cells16,17. Whether ITK also has a
function in modulating the development and/or function of IL-
10-producing Tr1 cells, is unexplored.
Beyond the finding that the cytokine IL-27 and the transcription
factors interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), avian musculoapo-
neurotic fibrosarcoma (cMAF) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AHR) are important for Tr1 cell differentiation, we have limited
knowledge of the signalling pathways that regulate the develop-
ment and, importantly, function of Tr1 cells. Here we show that, in
the absence of ITK, TCR engagement does not induce optimal
differentiation of Tr1 cells in multiple organs and during parasitic
or viral infection. The expression and activity of ITK are crucial for
Tr1 cell fate programming in both mouse and human, and for Tr1
cell function to suppress effector cell expansion. ITK deficiency
impairs IRF4 expression in both mouse and human Tr1 cell
development, and restoring IRF4 expression rescues Tr1 cell fate
programming and suppressive function in Itk deficient cells. The
RAS/MAPK signalling axis is indispensable for Tr1 cell develop-
ment, and constitutively active RAS signalling completely rescues
induction of IL-10 and IRF4 during Tr1 cell differentiation of Itk
deficient cells. Our findings identify ITK as a crucial component
that bridges extracellular signals, RAS signalling and IRF4
expression during Tr1 cell fate programming, and suggest that
ITK signalling components are potential targets for modulating
Tr1 cell development and function for clinical benefit.
Results
ITK is required for Tr1 cell development in vivo. We and others
have previously shown ITK as a negative regulator of Foxp3 þ
Treg cell development16,17, but its role in CD4 þ Foxp3 �IL-10 þ
Tr1 cell development is unclear. To determine the role of ITK in
Tr1 cell differentiation in vivo, we injected WT and Itk � / �
IL-10GFP/Foxp3RFP dual reporter mice with an anti-CD3e
antibody that has been shown to stimulate pronounced Tr1 cell
development through TCR activation in vivo3. We observed a
significant defect in IL-10 þFoxp3 � LAG3 þCD49b þ Tr1 cell
differentiation systemically in blood, spleen, lung, small intestine
and fat, in mice lacking the expression of ITK (Fig. 1), suggesting
that ITK is required for Tr1 cell development in vivo. IL-10
production can be significantly elevated in the pulmonary mucosa
during the late stages of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis18 and
influenza A19 infection to prevent tissue damage. To determine
whether ITK is required for Tr1 cell development during these
infections, we challenged mice with N. brasiliensis larvae or
influenza A (WSN) virus, and found that ITK is required for Tr1
cell differentiation during parasitic (Fig. 2a,b) and viral (Fig. 2c,d)
infections. Our data support a requisite role for ITK in Tr1 cell
development in vivo.
ITK is required for Tr1 cell fate programming in vitro. To
determine whether ITK regulates Tr1 cell development in vitro,
we isolated naive splenic CD4 þ T cells from WT and Itk � / �
mice carrying IL-10GFP/Foxp3RFP dual reporters, and cultured
them under Tr1-polarizing condition in vitro. We found that in
the absence of ITK, differentiation of IL-10 þ Foxp3 � Tr1 cells is
severely impaired, which persisted along the time course of our
observation (Fig. 3). A similar defect in Tr1 cell differentiation
was also observed using naive T cells isolated from the thymus
(Supplementary Fig. 1). ITK is not required for early activation of
CD4 þ T cells under Tr1-differentiation condition, as Itk � / �
CD4 þ T cells effectively up-regulated early activation markers
CD25 and CD69 within 48 h post stimulation (Fig. 3c), and all
cells proliferated within 72 h post stimulation (Fig. 3d). However,
in the absence of ITK, cells that proliferated failed in the induc-
tion of IL-10 production (Fig. 3d, bottom panel), and are
impaired in expression of the Tr1-related markers LAG3, CD49b,
ICOS and PD-1 (Fig. 3e,f). These data are suggestive of a requisite
role for ITK in Tr1 cell fate programming that is not explained by
a lack of T cell activation.
ITK kinase activity is required for Tr1 cell differentiation. We
have recently shown that the absence of ITK in T cells can have
different functional outcomes compared with inhibition of its
kinase activity20. Furthermore, the ITK inhibitors that have been
developed to date all exhibit varying degrees of cross reactivity with
other tyrosine kinases (see review ref. 21). To get around these
caveats, we developed a unique transgenic mouse system that
expresses an altered form of ITK, referred to as allele sensitive ITK
(or ITKas) that allows us to inhibit the kinase activity of ITK using
the small molecule 3MBPP1 (refs 16,20). To definitively and
unambiguously determine the consequence of inhibiting the kinase
activity of ITK during Tr1 cell development, we generated Itkas IL-
10GFP/Foxp3RFP dual reporter mice. Using naive CD4 þ cells from
these mice, we found that specifically inhibiting the kinase activity
of ITK resulted in similar defect in Tr1 cell differentiation to that
seen in the absence of ITK expression (Fig. 4a). They also exhibited
severely impaired expression of classically defined surface markers
of Tr1 cells, LAG3 and CD49b1 (Fig. 4b). Such defective Tr1 cell
differentiation is unlikely because of the lack of TCR-mediated cell
survival and proliferation but rather impaired Tr1 cell fate
programming, because CD4 þ T cells survival and proliferation
remained similar in the absence of ITK expression or its kinase
activity, compared with the case for WT T cells (Fig. 4b). We also
observed that the absence of ITK or its kinase activity resulted in a

 significant shift in the production of IFN-g instead of IL-10
under Tr1 polarizing conditions, although this was not induced by
TCR
re-activation
(Supplementary
Fig.
2),
suggestive
of
altered commitment to Tr1 cell fate decision during primary
stimulation. In human cells, inhibiting ITK kinase activity using the
selective ITK inhibitor BMS-509744 (ref. 22) or the broad Tec
kinase inhibitor CNX584 (ref. 23) revealed that the kinase activity
of ITK is required for IL-10 production and human Tr1 cell
differentiation as well (Fig. 4c,d), suggesting a conserved requisite
role for ITK activity in Tr1 cell fate programming in human and
mouse.
ITK kinase activity required for Tr1 cell suppressive function.
Tr1 cells can suppress effector T cell function in an IL-10-
dependent manner1,3, but we have little knowledge of how this
function is regulated. Because of the lack of methods to isolate
viable IL-10 producers and specially target them in a co-culture
system in the past, the main efforts in the field have been devoted
to Tr1 cell development as an end point. In our experimental
platform, the use of ITKas and its specific inhibitor 3MBPP1
would allow us to specifically target ITK kinase activity in Itkas
Tr1 cells when they are co-cultured with responding effector cells.
Using FACS sorted IL-10-producing Itkas Tr1 cells, we were able
to examine the role of ITK activity in Tr1 cell suppressive
function. We found that Itkas Tr1 cells are able to suppress
effector T cell expansion as efficiently as WT Tr1 cells, and
importantly, that inhibiting the kinase activity of ITK in the Itkas
Tr1 cells by 3MBPP1 significantly diminished their ability to
suppress (Fig. 5a,b), accompanied by a reduction in IL-10
production (Fig. 5c). These data indicate that ITK activity is
required for functional suppression by Tr1 cells.

 AHR agonist (or antagonist) was not able to rescue Tr1
differentiation in the absence of ITK (Fig. 6b). cMAF in the
other hand, showed an interesting discrepancy in mouse versus
human CD4 þ T cells during Tr1 cell differentiation (Fig. 6c,d),
which may be due to the difference in mouse and human Tr1 cell
polarizing conditions used. Nevertheless, given that ITK kinase
activity is required for both human and mouse Tr1 cell
development (Fig. 4), it is unlikely that defective cMAF
expression down-stream of ITK is responsible for the defect of
Tr1 cell development specifically in the mouse. We did however,
observe a significant reduction in IRF4 expression when ITK is
absent or inhibited in both mouse and human during Tr1 cell
development (Fig. 6e,f).
In CD4 þ T cells, IRF4 up-regulates IL-4 and IL-10 expression
under Th2 polarizing condition25; and IRF4 expression is reduced
during activation of Itk � / � CD8 þ T cells26 and Th9 cell
differentiation15. However, it is unclear whether IRF4 expression
alone is responsible for the Tr1 deficient phenotype we observe in
the absence of ITK. Thus to determine whether IRF4 expression is
down-stream of ITK signalling during Tr1 cell differentiation, we
transduced naive CD4 þ T cells with retroviral particles delivering
IRF4-YFP (or YFP alone as control). The transduction restored

 IRF4 expression in CD4 þ T cells cultured under Tr1-polarizing
condition (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b) and we found that the re-
expression of IRF4 in Itk deficient cells rescued Tr1 cell
development (Fig. 7a,b), suggesting that ITK signalling-driven
IRF4 expression is essential for Tr1 cell differentiation. To further
determine whether re-expression of IRF4 rescued the function of
Tr1 cells as well, we isolated cells that were transduced with IRF4-
RVYFP þ, along with controls, and performed the in vitro Tr1
suppression assay. Our results showed that Itk � / � Tr1 cells that
differentiated upon re-expression of IRF4 were fully functional in
suppressing responding T cell proliferation (Fig. 7c). Thus,
downstream of ITK, IRF4 is required for Tr1 cell functional
developmental.
ITK induced Blimp-1 does not drive Tr1 cell differentiation.
We have also noted that when IRF4 was re-expressed in Itk� / � T
cells, we always observed partial rescue of Tr1 cell differentiation
(Fig. 7), and so we sought to find additional regulators that might
function downstream of ITK in Tr1 cell development. Blimp-1 has
been shown to function jointly with IRF4 in regulating IL-10 pro-
duction in Foxp3 þ regulatory T cells27, and is critical for IL-10
production in CD4 þ T helper effector cells28 as well as antiviral
cytotoxic CD8þ T lymphocytes29. In the absence of ITK, CD4 þ T
cells cultured under Tr1-polarizing condition exhibited significantly
impaired induction of Blimp-1 expression, compared with WT cells
(Fig. 8a,b). To determine whether the lack of Blimp-1 expression
contributes to the impaired Tr1 cell differentiation in Itk� / � cells,
we re-expressed Blimp-1 using retroviral vectors that co-express the
human CD2 marker30 (to identify Blimp-1-expressing cells), and
found that over expression of Blimp-1 (Fig. 8c,d) downstream of
ITK is unable to rescue Tr1 cell differentiation (Fig. 8e).

in an ITK kinase dependent manner20,31. Similarly, MAP kinase
JNK activation is also severely impaired in Itk � / � T cells
stimulated through the TCR32. While TCR signals activate Ras
signalling, and the role of Ras in immediate TCR signalling is
subtle, Ras is required for Th1 protective immunity during
Leishmania major infection and Th2-mediated allergic asthma33
in mouse models. Whether Ras/MAPK signalling plays a role in
Tr1 cell differentiation, in particular, downstream of ITK is
unclear. We found that MAPK inhibitors, including ERK, JNK
and p38 inhibitors, as well as Ras inhibitor diminished IL-10

Discussion
Our data presented in this report support a requisite role for ITK
in Tr1 cell development in both mouse and human. Most
importantly, the activity of ITK is required for the suppressive
function of Tr1 cells. This function is executed through the kinase
activity of ITK, and its down-stream signals through HRas
activation and IRF4 expression.
Although both Tr1 cells and Foxp3 þ regulatory T cells can
produce IL-10 and can suppress T cell proliferation, the role of
ITK is different. We and others have reported that ITK, and its
kinase activity, suppresses the development of Foxp3 þ regulatory
T
cells16,17.
However,
our
work
here
indicates
that
the
requirement for ITK in Tr1 cells is more analogous to its role
in T effector cells such as Th2, Th9 and Th17 cells12,15,34. While
the signals downstream of ITK in inducing Th1 differentiation
remains unclear, ITK regulation of the transcription factor NFAT
has been shown to be critical for its ability to regulate naive cell
differentiation to Th2 and Th17 cell fates12,34. Furthermore,
Schwartzberg and colleagues recently reported that ITK signals
via IRF4 to regulate naive cell differentiation to Th9 cell fate and
production of IL-9 (ref. 15). Notably, in the absence of ITK, Th9
cell differentiation is fully rescued by the presence of IL-2,
production of which is also defective in the absence of ITK. These
previous findings suggest that IL-2 may play a role in the function
of ITK in Tr1 cell differentiation. Indeed, addition of exogenous
IL-2 is able to partially rescue Tr1 cell differentiation in the
absence of ITK, although addition of exogenous TGF-b is unable
to do so (Supplementary Fig. 4).

 We found that the absence of ITK or its kinase activity resulted
in defects in expression of the transcription factor AHR, cMAF
and IRF4 in T cells activated under Tr1 cell-differentiation
conditions. These three transcription factors have all been shown
to be important in Tr1 cell differentiation and IL-10 production
in T cells 24,25,27,35. However, an AHR ligand is unable to rescue
the Tr1 cell differentiation defects in the absence of ITK, and
cMAF expression is not affected in human T cells when ITK
kinase activity is inhibited. Our findings that re-expression of
IRF4 rescues both Tr1 cell differentiation and function, suggests
that IRF4 plays an important role in this process downstream of
ITK. AHR can bind to cMAF promoter and regulates cMAF
expression during Tr1 cell differentiation24. We have also
found that re-expression of IRF4 rescued AHR expression in
Itk � / � CD4 þ T cell under Tr1 cell-differentiating condition
(Supplementary Fig. 3c,d). Our data suggest that IRF4 is sufficient
to compensate for a lack of ITK as re-expression of IRF4 rescues
Tr1 cell differentiation and function. Notably, IRF4 has been
reported to lie upstream of Blimp-1, and together both are
required for IL-10 production in Foxp3 þ regulatory T cells27.
However, despite the requisite role of ITK signals for the
expression of Blimp-1 in Tr1 cells, re-expression of Blimp-1 in
ITK deficient cells does not rescue Tr1 cell differentiation. This
suggests that IRF4-regulated genes are critical for this process,
and the process cannot be rescued by Blimp-1 alone in the
absence of ITK.
We found that inhibition of Ras, and the downstream MAP
kinase pathways, particularly ERK and JNK, reduced both Tr1
differentiation and the expression of IRF4. Furthermore, over-
expression of HRas, or constitutively active HRas, in Itk � / � T
cells also rescued Tr1 cell differentiation, along with IRF4
expression. Given that the re-expression of IRF4 in the absence of
ITK rescues Tr1 function, we infer that the HRas pathway, by
rescuing IRF4, is able to rescue Tr1 cell function as well. The TCR
pathways leading to IRF4 are unclear, and our data shows for the
first time that downstream of the TCR and ITK, the Ras/MAPK
pathways leads to IRF4 expression during Tr1 cell differentiation.
In addition to conventional differentiation of Tr1 cells from
naive CD4 þ progenitors, it has recently been shown that Tr1
cells can be derived from cells that had once been Th17 cells
but then lost IL-17 production (exTh17 cells) during the
resolution of inflammation11. Our unique Itkas mice allowed us
to be able to generate Th17 cells, where ITK could be specifically
targeted by 3MBPP1. We found that similar to the role for ITK in
differentiation of Tr1 cells, the kinase activity of ITK is also
required for optimal trans-differentiation of exTh17 cell into Tr1

 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5b). However, given that ITK kinase
activity is also required for Th17 cell development, survival,
proliferation and maintenance of RORgt expression under Tr1-
polarizing condition (Supplementary Fig. 5a,c), the effect of
inhibiting ITK on down-regulation of IRF4 expression and
inhibition of IL-10 production might be the result of a
combination
of
cell
survival,
proliferation
and
cell
fate
reprogramming. Whether ITK functions in trans-differentiation
of exTh17 cell into Tr1 cells in vivo remains to be further
explored.
Comparing our results in the mouse and human T cells, we
found that in human cells, two different ITK inhibitors exhibit
differential effects inhibiting the level of IL-10, cell surface
markers LAG3/CD49b and transcription factor IRF4 expression.
This may be because of the different characteristics and IC50s of
these compounds, as well as potentially different off target effects.
Note that our work with the 3MBPP1 on the murine cells
expressing the Itkas allele is much more indicative of what would
happen when we only inhibited ITK activity, however, we are
not able to use this inhibitor in the human T cells for
obvious reasons. Furthermore, it is recently reported that IL-10-
producing T cells derived from human CD4 þ memory T cells
exhibit low levels of LAG3/CD49b expression36, in contrast to
what was observed in human Tr1 cells derived from naive human
CD4 þ T cells1. Thus, the effect of inhibiting ITK in human IL-
10-producing CD4 þ T cells needs to be further explored to
consider those derived from naive precursors versus memory
cells.
In our experiments, we also examined the responses of Itk � / �
mice to infection with N. brasiliensis and Flu. While the response
of Itk � / � mice to infection with N. brasiliensis has been
previously reported34, this work was performed before the
discovery of Tr1 cells, and the response of these mice to
infection with Flu have not been reported. In both infection
models, we found that the Tr1 cell response was quite organ
specific, with significant Tr1 cell response found largely in the
lungs and to a lesser extent in the mesenteric/draining lymph
nodes in both models, with little response in the spleen
(Supplementary Fig. 6). Furthermore, while infection with
N. brasiliensis led to increased recovery of parasites in the
absence of ITK (Supplementary Fig. 6), there was no difference in
the recovery of virus from the lungs of Flu infected mice, and
no difference in body weights, although there was reduced
survival of Itk � / � mice (Supplementary Fig. 6). The complex
immunological phenotype of the Itk deficiency beyond our
analysis of Tr1 cell responses in vivo, with multiple cell types
exhibiting different phenotypes12–17,23,26,32,34,37–46, makes it
more
challenging
to
provide
an
explanation
for
these
phenotypes without significant additional experiments.
Regulatory T cell function can be a double-edge sword,
beneficial in controlling inflammation and promoting immune
tolerance, but detrimental in causing immune depression under
conditions of infections or in the face or tumours. Tr1 cells have
been found to be abundant in chronic hepatitis C virus47 and
Mycobacterium tuberculosis48 infection, as well as in tumour
microenvironments49,50, which may lead to a lack of or reduced
60 hrs under Tr1 differentiating condition

 immune response to clearing viruses, bacteria or tumours. Given
the
functional
requirement
for
ITK
kinase
activity
in
differentiated Tr1 cells, targeting ITK activity and its signalling
pathway specifically in Tr1 cells may be a promising strategy in
modulating immune suppression due to the functions of Tr1 cells
under such circumstances, although further work in humans will
have to be done to determine this. These findings place ITK and
its signalling axis as promising therapeutic targets to modulate
Tr1 cell numbers and activity for treating diseases such as
inflammation, chronic infection and tumours.

Itk � / � or Itkas background. ITKas/Itk � / � (Tg(hCD2-Itkas)Itk � / �) mice,
that is, Itkas, were as previously described16,20, and harbour an altered ATP
binding pocket (F434G/D429) in ITK kinase domain allowing specific
inhibition by 1-(tert-Butyl)-3-(3-methylbenzyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-
4-amine (3MBPP1). All mice were bred in house, and both female and male

and IL-4 (Supplementary Fig. 7) as determined by flow cytometry. To test the effect
of IL-2 and TGF-b in Tr1 cell differentiation, recombinant human (rh) TGF-b or
IL-2 (Peprotech) were added as indicated. ITK inhibitor BMS-509744 (Millipore)
was used at 1 mM (ref. 22); ITKas specific inhibitor 3MBPP1 (Millipore) was used at
2 mM (ref. 16). AHR agonist 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and
antagonist GNF-351 (kind gifts from Dr G. Perdew, Penn State University) were

Human Tr1 differentiation in vitro. Leukopaks were procured from the New York
Blood Center (Long Island, NY) collected from healthy cohorts. The use of human
blood cells was considered exempt and approved by the Institutional Review Board
at Cornell University. Human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) were isolated
from blood using gradient separation in Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare).
PBMC were cultured in full RPMI-1640 medium (RPMI-1640 medium base
(Gibco, 11875-093) with 10% fetal bovine serum (ATLAS Biological, F-0500-D),

ratio in the presence of various antibodies and/or cytokines as indicated below:
Th2-polarizing condition included anti-CD3e (1 mg ml–1), anti-CD28 (1 mg ml–1),
rh IL-2 (PeproTech, 20 ng ml–1), and rm IL-4 (PeproTech, 40 ng ml–1), anti-IFN-g

N. brasiliensis and Influenza A/WSN/1933 (WSN) infection. Mice were given
500 L3 N. brasiliensis larvae per mouse through subcutaneous injection, or 1 LD50
(104 PFU) WSN per mouse through intranasal treatment. Cells from the spleen,
lymph nodes and lungs were analyzed at the indicated time points. Parasite burden
in mice infected with N. brasiliensis was determined on 7 days post infection
(7 d.p.i.) by opening the small intestines longitudinally under an optical micro-
scope. Weight of mice infected with WSN was collected every 24 h, and mice that
lost 420% of the original weight were killed and recorded as dead. Plaque-forming
units (PFU) of WSN in lungs of mice infected with WSN were determined by
plaque assay using MDBK cells60. Lungs were sectioned and stained with Periodic
Acid-Schiff (PAS) by the Animal Health Diagnostic Center at Cornell University.
In vitro suppression assay. CD45.1 þCD45.2– naive responder cells were labeled
with 5 mM CFSE (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and co-cultured with Mitomycin-C
treated APCs, in the presence or absence of anti-CD3e (0.5–1 mg ml–1). WT and
Itkas Tr1 cells (CD45.2 þ) were differentiated in vitro, sort purified (4 98%
IL-10GFP þFoxp3RFP �), and used as suppressors in the indicated ratios to the
naive responders (CD45.1 þ). 3MBPP1 (1–2 mM) was added to specifically inhibit
the kinase activity of ITK in Itkas Tr1 cells, without affecting the kinase activity of
ITK in responder T cells. Division of responder cells was analysed 3 days later, and
Division Index (DI) was calculated using the FlowJo (Tree Star) ‘Proliferation
Platform’, in which DI is defined as the ratio of ‘the total number of divisions/the
number of cells at start of culture’. Then the average of DI of responder cells with
anti-CD3 stimulation but no Tr1 cell suppression was termed DI0, while the DI of
responder cells under condition i was termed as DIi. The percentage of suppression
(PS) under condition i was defined as ‘PSi ¼ 100 � (1–DIi/DI0)’61.
Retroviral transduction. The pGC-IRES-yellow fluorescent protein retroviral
vector (YFP-RV), pGC-IRF4-IRES-YFP-RV, and packaging vector pCL-Eco are as
previously described62 (kind gifts from Dr A. Pernis, Hospital for Special Surgery).
To generate pGC-HRas-IRES-YFP-RV and pGC-HRasG12V-IRES-YFP-RV, the
HRas and HRasG12V cDNA (kind gift from Dr R. Cerione, Cornell University)
were cloned into the pGC-IRES-YFP-RV via the 50 Not I and 30 Xho I restriction
site ligation respectively, and verified by DNA sequencing. The pMX-IRES-human
CD2 (hCD2) RV and pMX-Blimp1-IRES-hCD2 RV are as previously described30
(kind gifts from Dr T. Malek, University of Miami). HEK 293FT cells were
cotransfected with the retroviral vector and the packaging vector. Retroviral
supernatants were harvested 48 and 72 h post transfection, concentrated using
Retro-X concentrator (Clontech, Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA), and used to
infect naive CD4 þ T cells that had been stimulated under Tr1 cell differentiating
conditions overnight. 48 h after infection, CD4 þ T cells that expressed the protein
encoded by the retroviral vector (YFP þ or hCD2 þ) were analysed for Tr1 cell
differentiation and function.
Flow cytometry. Surface staining of live cells were done in the presence of Fc
block and fixable viability dye. For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were sti-
mulated with PMA (100 ng
ml–1), Ionomycin (0.5 mM), Brefeldin A (5 mg
ml–1)
and Monensin (2 mM) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 4 h, followed by fixation
with 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA), per-
meabilization and staining with anti-cytokine antibodies in PBS/0.15% saponin
(Sigma). Staining for nuclear factors Ki67, FOXP3, AHR, cMAF, Blimp-1 and IRF4
were performed with Foxp3 staining buffer kit (eBioscience). Flow cytometry data
were acquired on LSRII, FACS Aria II or Fusion systems (BD Biosciences), and
analyzed in FlowJo (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). All analyses were done gated on
fixable viability dye negative singlet population. Representative plots of gating
strategies for sorting and cell analyses are shown in Supplementary Fig. 8.
Quantitative real time PCR. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit
(Qiagen) and cDNA was synthesized using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-
Rad). To quantify the gene transcript levels, ‘Best Coverage’ gene probes for mouse
Gapdh (Mm99999915_g1), mouse Il10 (Mm01288386_m1), human GAPDH
(Hs02786624_g1) and human IL10 (Hs00961622_m1) (TaqMan, Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY) were used on a ViiA 7 real-time PCR system
following the manufacturer’s recommended program (Hold Stage: 50 �C for 2 min,
95 �C for 10 min; then PCR Stage with 40 cycles: 95 �C for 15 s and 60 �C for
1 min). IL-10 relative mRNA level was calculated by normalizing Il10 values to the
internal loading control Gapdh values first, and then to the average of Il10/Gapdh
values in WT.
Statistical analysis. Non-parametric Mann–Whitney test, one-way ANOVA with
Tukey’s Post-Hoc test, two-way ANOVA, and Log-rank test were performed using
GraphPad Prism v5.00 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA), with Pr0.05 considered
statistically significant. ‘NS’ refers to ‘No Significance’.
