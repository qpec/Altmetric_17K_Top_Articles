Abstract
Latin Americans are highly heterogeneous regarding the type of Native American ancestry.
Consideration of specific associations with common diseases may lead to substantial
advances in unraveling of disease etiology and disease prevention.
Here we investigate possible associations between the type of Native American ancestry
and leading causes of death. After an aggregate-data study based on genome-wide geno-
type data from 1805 admixed Chileans and 639,789 deaths, we validate an identified associ-
ation with gallbladder cancer relying on individual data from 64 gallbladder cancer patients,
with and without a family history, and 170 healthy controls. Native American proportions
were markedly underestimated when the two main types of Native American ancestry in
Chile, originated from the Mapuche and Aymara indigenous peoples, were combined
together. Consideration of the type of Native American ancestry was crucial to identify dis-
ease associations. Native American ancestry showed no association with gallbladder

the German Federal Ministry of Education and
Research (BMBF, grant 01DN15021), Germany’s
 cancer mortality (P = 0.26). By contrast, each 1% increase in the Mapuche proportion
represented a 3.7% increased mortality risk by gallbladder cancer (95%CI 3.1–4.3%,
P = 6×10−27). Individual-data results and extensive sensitivity analyses confirmed the asso-
ciation between Mapuche ancestry and gallbladder cancer. Increasing Mapuche proportions
were also associated with an increased mortality due to asthma and, interestingly, with a
decreased mortality by diabetes. The mortality due to skin, bladder, larynx, bronchus and
lung cancers increased with increasing Aymara proportions. Described methods should be
considered in future studies on human population genetics and human health. Complemen-
tary individual-based studies are needed to apportion the genetic and non-genetic compo-
nents of associations identified relying on aggregate-data.
Author summary
A lot of attention has been paid to Latino heterogeneity related to individual proportions
of Native American, European and African ancestry. The importance of the type of Native
American ancestry for health, however, has hardly been studied. Here we examined
genetic data from 2,039 admixed Chileans to investigate possible associations between top
causes of death and the two major types of Native American ancestry in Chile. Our find-
ings demonstrate the necessity of suitable surrogates for ancestry estimation which mirror
the actual composition of the study population, and the advantage of considering fine-
scale Latino heterogeneity for unraveling of disease etiology and personalized healthcare.
Introduction
Differences in disease prevalence between Latinos and other populations are well established.
Latin Americans and Latino Americans show in general higher incidence rates of gallbladder
and stomach cancer, asthma and diabetes, and lower incidences of breast and prostate cancer
than non-Hispanic Whites and African Americans [1–10]. Recently much attention has been
paid to differences in disease susceptibility according to the individual proportions of Native
American, European and African ancestry [11, 12]. On average, Colombians and Puerto
Ricans have higher percentages of African ancestry than Mexicans and Chileans, and this
potentially translates into differential disease risks, with important implications to health pol-
icy [13]. This article focuses on a finer level of genetic heterogeneity, namely on the type of
Native American ancestry. Even if two persons from Mexico and Chile have identical Native
American proportions, let say equal to 50%, their Native American proportions originate from
different native peoples, potentially resulting in unequal disease susceptibilities and preva-
lences. So far, Latino heterogeneity related to the type of Native American ancestry is not con-
sidered in disease prevention and management programs. Present results may contribute to
changing this situation.
The genome of modern Chileans is the result of genetic admixture between Native Ameri-
cans from two major indigenous peoples, the Mapuche and the Aymara, Spaniards who
reached Chile in the mid-sixteenth century, African slaves who arrived in seventeenth century,
and subsequent migrations in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, mainly from Europe.
Recent publications on genetic variability in Chile highlight the relevance of examining Native
American ancestry to understand population history [13–16]. Based on genotype data from

 313 Chileans, Eyheramendy et al. confirmed previously reported larger contributions of Euro-
pean men and Native American women, and attributed the increased Native American pro-
portion in the South of the country to the late occupation of this territory by non-indigenous
immigrants [14]. The predominance of Native American ancestry in the south of Chile was
corroborated by Ruiz-Linares et al., who utilized 1561 Chilean genotypes to investigate the
geographic variation in ancestry in a large Latin American study [13].
The goal of the present study is markedly different. We focus here on the relationship
between top causes of mortality and the two main types of Native American ancestry in Chile.
We conduct first an aggregate-data study based on 1805 subjects, and then validate an identi-
fied association between Mapuche ancestry and gallbladder cancer using individual data from
64 patients and 170 healthy controls with and without a family history. In total, the present
study relies on genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data from 2,039 admixed Chi-
leans and 639,789 country-wide registered deaths between 2005 and 2011. It aims to illustrate
the need to consider fine-scale Latino heterogeneity to advance in the understanding of disease
etiology, and to personalize healthcare. Our investigation benefited from 1) the geography of
Chile, a country with over 4,300 km from north to south but only 200 km from east to west
which shows large regional differences in disease-specific mortality rates, 2) the genetic archi-
tecture of Chileans which is largely composed of European and Native American ancestry and
presents a low (3%) African component, and 3) the clear separation of the two investigated
subcomponents of Native American ancestry which varies greatly from Northern to Southern
Chile.
Results
Fig 1A shows results from a genetic principal component analysis (PCA) of individuals used in
the aggregate-data study using 64 samples from the Americas in the Human Genome Diversity
Project (HGDP) as surrogates of Native American ancestry. The first principal component
explained around 3% of genetic variability and distinguished Africans from non-Africans, the
second principal component explained about 1.5% of variability and separated the European
and Native American ancestry components. Fig 1B shows PCA results relying on Mapuche
and Aymara individuals as surrogates of the two largest indigenous peoples in Chile. The first
and third principal components based on HGDP are plotted in Fig 1C, analogous results using
Mapuche and Aymara reference individuals are shown in Fig 1D. The third principal compo-
nent explained 0.3% of genetic variability and separated the Mapuche from the Aymara Native
American subcomponents. A larger genetic variability was observed in the Mapuche compared
to the Aymara reference group (dot dispersion in Fig 1B and 1D).
Mapuche and Aymara individuals showed the lowest genetic distance among all four refer-
ence groups (Weir & Cockerham’s Fst = 0.038). According to ADMIXTURE recommenda-
tions, the large number of SNPs available (more than 300,000 after quality control and
merging with reference individuals) was more than sufficient to estimate ancestry proportions
[17]. Fig 1E shows the correlation between Native American proportions estimated using
HGDP, and the sum of Mapuche and Aymara proportions when four reference groups (Afri-
can, European, Mapuche and Aymara) were considered. The correlation between the sum of
Mapuche and Aymara proportions, and the sum of the two corresponding Native American
proportions when the number of ancestral populations was set to four in an unsupervised
ADMIXTURE analysis with three reference panels (African, European and HGDP) is shown
in Fig 1F. Irrespective of the admixture estimation method (un/supervised) and the assumed
number of ancestral populations (three/four), use of HDGP instead of Mapuche and Aymara
reference individuals resulted in an underestimation of the Native American ancestry

 component in individuals with a large Mapuche proportion, and an underestimation of the
overall Native American ancestry, represented by the sum of Mapuche and Aymara propor-
tions. Supplementary S2 Fig depicts the high correlation between Native American propor-
tions estimated using HGDP and proportion estimates that relied on the combined set of
Mapuche and Aymara individuals in a single group.
Table 1 shows the estimated average Native American (HDGP reference), Mapuche and
Aymara ancestry components in the aggregate-data study, and possible ancestry differences by
age, gender, educational level, socioeconomic status, salary and each of the 15 Chilean regions.
Complete results for African and European proportions are available as supplementary mate-
rial. The mean Native American ancestry component in the 1805 individuals from the present
aggregate-data study amounted to 40% (95%CI 37%-43%). This proportion was smaller than
the sum of average Mapuche (40%, 95%CI 37%-42%) and Aymara (8%, 95%CI 4%-12%) pro-
portions, confirming the necessity of suitable surrogates for ancestry estimation which reflect
the actual composition of the study population. The average European and African percent-
ages estimated using four reference groups were 49% (95%CI 47%-52%) and 3% (95%CI 2%-
3%), respectively. Increasing Native American ancestry was associated with a lower socioeco-
nomic status, and the largest Native American proportions were found in the north and in the
south of Chile (Fig 2). The overall picture was markedly different when the Mapuche and
Aymara subcomponents of Native American ancestry were separated. Males included in the
aggregate-data study showed a 2% larger Mapuche component than participating women due
to the larger proportion of men enrolled from the south compared to women. Increasing
Mapuche ancestry associated with a lower educational level and with a lower socioeconomic
status. For example, the average Mapuche component was 40%-6% = 34% in the ABC1 group
(high middle class), compared to 40% in the D/E strata (semi- and un-skilled manual occupa-
tions, unemployed and lowest grade occupations). Mapuche ancestry showed large regional
differences, with the highest proportion (54%) in the De los Rı
´os, and the lowest percentage
(30%) in the De Arica y Parinacota regions (Fig 2). Opposite results were noticed for the
Aymara ancestry component. Males included in the aggregate-data study showed a 2% lower
Aymara component than women. Aymara ancestry differences by educational level and socio-
economic status did not reach statistical significance. The highest Aymara component was
found in the De Arica y Parinacota (29%) and De Tarapaca
´ (28%) regions, and the lowest pro-
portion (6%) in the De los Rı
´os region.
In addition to regional estimates of African, European, Native American, Mapuche and
Aymara ancestry components, Fig 2 shows regional mortality rates due to gallbladder cancer
in Chile. The correlation between Mapuche proportions and gallbladder cancer mortality rates
was striking. Table 2 provides estimates of the strength of association between the two leading
causes of death in Chile—diseases of the circulatory system and neoplasms—and Native Amer-
ican, Mapuche and Aymara proportions. Corresponding results for all investigated disease cat-
egories, African and European ancestry components are provided as supplementary material.
Since around 500 ICD10-categories were investigated, the following description of aggregate-
data results highlights associations with probability values under 0.05/500 = 0.0001. The neces-
sity of separating the Mapuche and the Aymara subcomponents due to possible masking of
contrary effects was evident. For example, Native American ancestry did not show evidence of
association with mortality by multiple valve diseases (P = 0.98), but a 1% increase in Mapuche
ancestry translated into a 5.7% increased risk of death due to diseases in this category
(P = 2×10−6). Increasing Mapuche ancestry was also associated with increasing mortality risks
due to atrial fibrillation and flutter, hypertensive heart disease, sequelae of cerebrovascular dis-
ease and myocardial infarction, and with a decreasing risk of death by other cerebrovascular
diseases. Increasing Aymara ancestry associated with a lower mortality risk due to the majority

 of diseases of the circulatory system. The advantage of separating the Mapuche and Aymara
ancestry subcomponents was also obvious for neoplasms. For example, Native American
ancestry did not show any association with gallbladder cancer mortality (P = 0.26). By contrast,
a 1% increase in the Mapuche proportion represented a 3.7% increased mortality risk

 (P = 6×10−27), and a 1% increase in Aymara ancestry translated into a 2.7% lower risk of death
due to gallbladder cancer. Increasing Mapuche ancestry was associated with an increasing
mortality due to gallbladder, esophagus and stomach cancers, malignant neoplasms without
specification of site and myelodysplastic syndromes, and with a decreasing risk of bladder, lar-
ynx, skin, and bronchus and lung cancers. Opposite associations were noticed for Aymara
ancestry, e.g. the mortality risk due to skin, bladder, larynx, bronchus and lung cancers
increased with increasing Aymara proportions.
Standardized mortality ratios for diseases of the respiratory and digestive systems, and for
endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases by 1% increase in the Native American, Mapu-
che andAymara proportions are provided in Table 3. For example, a 1% increase in the Mapu-
che proportion translated into a 4.7% increased mortality risk due to asthma, but also with a
-1.3% mortality risk by diabetes.
Results from the stepwise forward model selection to identify the most significantly associ-
ated ancestry components are shown in Fig 3. Native American ancestry was not selected for
any disease. Mapuche ancestry showed the most significant associations with mortality rates
due to 12 ICD10-disease categories, including asthma and gallbladder cancer, and the Aymara
component was selected for 19 categories. No model selection resulted in the simultaneous
inclusion of both the Mapuche and the Aymara proportions.
Panels A-C in Fig 4 show results from an exploratory genetic principal component analysis
of genotypes of individuals included in the validation study. In agreement with results based
on aggregate-data, the first principal component (7.1% of genetic variability) distinguished
African from non-African ancestry, the second principal component (2.7% of variability)
separated European and Native American ancestry components, and the third principal

 component (0.4% of genetic variability) mirrored the Mapuche-Aymara ancestry axis. The
genotypes of some individuals who developed gallbladder cancer (GBC, filled dots) were
markedly close/similar to the genotypes of Mapuche reference individuals. Hazard ratios esti-
mated in the validation study are shown in Table 4. The validation collective included 186
women and 48 men who showed similar risks of being diagnosed with gallbladder cancer
(P = 0.66). Each 1% increase in the Mapuche proportion translated into a 2% increased risk of
being diagnosed with gallbladder cancer (P = 0.04). Taking into account family structure and
integrating the Chilean gallbladder cancer incidence rates in a Cox proportional hazards sur-
vival model, as implemented in the Mendel software, resulted in a hazard ratio equal to 1.02
(P = 0.05).
Sensitivity analyses identified no outliers with noticeable influence on regional estimates of
the ancestry components; outlier plots are provided as supplementary material. Use of resam-
pling techniques to account for the differential number of individuals per region in the aggre-
gate-data study showed a marginal impact on the estimated standardized mortality ratio for
gallbladder cancer; the increased mortality risk per 1% Mapuche proportion estimated by
resampling was 3.3% (95% CI 2.5 to 4.1%).

 of the Native American proportion in Mapuche reference individuals resulted in a stronger
relationship between Mapuche ancestry and mortality due to gallbladder cancer based on
aggregated data (4.1% increased mortality risk per 1% increase in the Mapuche percentage),
and it showed no effect on the hazard ratios estimated in the validation study.
Inclusion of hospitalization rates due to cholecystectomy as additional explanatory variable
in a multiple Poisson regression model resulted in a 3.0% increased mortality risk due to gall-
bladder cancer (95% CI 2.3 to 3.7%) per 1% increase in the Mapuche percentage.
As above mentioned, part of the validation collective–around half of the dataset–was previ-
ously investigated by Koshiol et al. and it did not include affected families [18]. The average
Mapuche proportion in this subset of the validation collective amounted 47%, and the corre-
sponding hazard ratio for gallbladder cancer per 1% increase in the Mapuche proportion was
1.026. The second half of the validation collective was newly recruited and it included the four
families depicted in Fig 4D. The average Mapuche proportion in the second subset of the vali-
dation study was lower (40%), and the corresponding hazard ratio was higher (1.035) than in
the complete validation collective. Although the difference between hazard ratios in the second

Discussion
We report here for the first time on the relationship between leading causes of death and the
type of Native American ancestry. Fortunately, awareness of the importance of accounting for
genetic diversity within ethnic groups in public health is raising fast [19, 20]. The need to esti-
mate ancestry components using reference individuals who reflect the actual composition of
the study population was also a relevant finding of the present investigation. Previous studies
have demonstrated the need of accounting for fine-scale ancestry patterns to identify possible
associations with biomedical traits [11, 12, 21]. Among Latinos, Puerto Ricans show higher
mortality rates due to asthma than Mexican Americans [22–25]. Considering this difference,
which could be attributed to the increased African component of Puerto Ricans, or to sub-con-
tinental differences in European ancestry with Mexicans, may be critical to individualize medi-
cine approaches tailored to asthmatics from different ethnic groups. Another novelty of the
present study was the identification of the Mapuche-Aymara ancestry axis as the third major
component of genetic variability in Chile. The low genetic distance between Mapuche and
Aymara reference individuals (Fst = 0.038) contrasts with larger genetic differences observed
among other Native American indigenous peoples [21]. The geography and the settlement his-
tory of Chile, which was principally populated from North to South, likely explain this low
genetic distance. Investigation of the subcomponents of Native American ancestry may help to
refine previously identified associations with human disease. For example, combination of the
Mapuche and Aymara subcomponents of Native American ancestry in Chile resulted in an
overall underestimation of the Native American percentage. We identified an association
between asthma mortality and Mapuche ancestry but, due to opposite effects for Mapuche and

 Aymara proportions, the association between Native American ancestry and asthma did not
reach statistical significance.
In agreement with previous studies, the first principal component of genetic variability
among Chileans separated African from non-African contributions, and Chileans showed on
average a low percentage of African ancestry [13, 14]. The bulk of the study population was
dispersed between Native American and European reference individuals, and this dispersion
constituted the second component of genetic variability. Examination of the Mapuche and
Aymara proportions permitted identification of novel associations that are relevant from both
a social and a public health context. Increasing Mapuche ancestry was associated with a lower
educational level and a lower socioeconomic status in Chile. From the point of view of public
health, increasing Mapuche proportions were associated with increased mortalities due to cer-
tain types of cancer (gallbladder, esophagus and stomach tumors, malignant neoplasms with-
out specification of site and myelodysplastic syndromes). Increasing Aymara percentages
corresponded to increased mortality risks by bladder, larynx, skin, and bronchus and lung
neoplasms. Although the relative contribution of socioeconomic factors, access to health ser-
vices and therapy response to mortality differences in Chile needs further investigation, results
from the present study suggest that finer gradation of Latino and Native American ancestry
may have important implications for prevention and disease management, not only in Chile
but in other parts of the world.
The possible confounding of some of the identified associations between ancestry propor-
tions and disease-specific mortality risks by geographical, socioeconomic and cultural factors
was a limitation of present results based on aggregate-data. Regarding geography, the associa-
tion between Aymara ancestry and non-melanoma skin cancer was probably related to the
high ultraviolet radiation in the north of Chile [26]. The relationship between Aymara propor-
tions and mortality due to lung and bladder cancers could be attributed to a large extent to the
high concentration of arsenic in drinking-water in the north of Chile [27]. Although con-
founding by socioeconomic factors cannot be ruled out, access to individual information on
educational level, socioeconomic status and salary represented a clear advantage of the present
aggregate-data study over plain ecological investigations [28]. This permitted adjustment of
the estimated mortality risk ratios for possible confounders at both the individual (Table 1)
and the regional levels (for example, hospitalization rates due to gallbladder removal as surro-
gate of access to the health system in sensitivity analyses). Culture and ancestry go often
together, but it should be kept in mind that our study relied on admixed people with a continu-
ous gradient of ancestry. In other words, two hypothetical individuals with 25% and 30%
Aymara proportions would probably present a similar physical appearance and possibly be
exposed to similar culture-related environments. Yet according to our findings, their mortality
risks due to esophageal cancer would be markedly different, precisely 5 x 3.7% = 18.5%. Sum-
ming up, present aggregate-data results need future investigations based on individual data to
apportion the different components of the complex relationship between genetic ancestry and
human disease.
Consideration of individual ancestry proportions may boost the personalization of preven-
tion and disease management programs [19–21]. Less healthy lipid profiles have been found in
Mexican Americans than in European Americans, and this information has been translated
into tailored prevention programs for associated diseases [29]. Hispanics and European Amer-
icans show higher rates of hepatitis C viral clearance after treatment than African Americans,
and precision medicine has recognized the need of clinical trials with African American partic-
ipants to decrease treatment disparities [30]. In agreement with our findings (Supplementary
S2 Table), European ancestry has been associated with cardiovascular disease, and European-
ancestry specific susceptibility variants for heart failure have been identified, adding

 plausibility to reported associations based on aggregate-data [31, 32]. It is relatively well-
known that race and ethnic group are inaccurate predictors of disease risk and response to
treatment, but this imprecision has been largely attributed to the differential ancestry percent-
ages. For example, Latinos from Mexico show average Native American (African) proportions
equal to 56% (5%), compared to 29% (11%) for Colombian Latinos [13]. The present study
goes one step further and demonstrates the added value of considering ancestral groups which
reflect the actual composition of the study population. The average Native American propor-
tions of Chileans in the De Arica y Parinacota and the De los Rı
´os regions were similar around
(58%), but the Mapuche and Aymara percentages were markedly different, 54% Mapuche and
6% Aymara in the De los Rı
´os compared to 30% Mapuche and 29% Aymara in the De Arica y
Parinacota regions, resulting in considerably different disease-specific mortality rates and
associated healthcare needs.
Gallbladder cancer is a major health problem in Chile, where the disease represents the sec-
ond leading cause of cancer death in women after breast cancer. While the association between
Native American ancestry and gallbladder cancer is well established, an added value of the
present findings lies in the refinement and accurate quantification of the strength of this asso-
ciation [1, 18, 33–36]. We found that the mortality risk due to gallbladder cancer increased by
3.7% (95% CI of 3.1 to 4.3%) per 1% increase in the Mapuche proportion. The statistical analy-
sis of validation data from sporadic and familial gallbladder cancer cases, and from unaffected
individuals, was consistent with this association: a 1% increase in the Mapuche component
corresponded to a 2% increased risk of developing gallbladder cancer. Resampling results sug-
gested that the relationship between Mapuche ancestry and gallbladder cancer was robust
against the differential number of individuals per region in the aggregate-data study. Sensitiv-
ity analyses revealed a minor contribution of the differential access to the health system to this
association, and hinted that the use of Mapuche reference individuals with larger Native
American proportions may result in stronger association effects.
These results may have important repercussions at the population and individual levels
given the large variability of Mapuche proportions in the Chilean population. In the present
study, the first (third) quartiles of Mapuche proportions were 28% (43%) in the aggregate-
data, and 38% (49%) in the validation dataset, respectively. At the population level, the Chilean
government financially supports gallbladder removal for individuals between ages 35 and 49
years to prevent gallbladder cancer; prophylactic cholecystectomy could be also indicated in
other high risk populations [37, 38]. The difference in Mapuche proportions between the De
los Rı
´os and the De Arica y Parinacota regions translates into an expected 24x3.7 = 89% differ-
ence in gallbladder cancer mortality, which may point to the necessity of intensified preven-
tion measures in southern regions of the country. At the individual level, people with relatives
affected by gallbladder cancer could opt for estimating their risk of developing gallbladder can-
cer relying on individual ancestry percentages, and make medical decisions based on this
information. Future studies are needed to develop and validate risk prediction models which
incorporate genetic ancestry and other risk factors in order to personalize gallbladder cancer
prevention.
In summary, admixed Chileans show two main types of Native American ancestry: Mapu-
che and Aymara. Increasing Mapuche proportions are specifically associated with an increased
mortality due to asthma and gallbladder cancer, and with a decreased mortality due to diabe-
tes. Increasing Aymara percentages correspond to increased risk of death by melanoma and
bladder, larynx, skin, and bronchus and lung neoplasms. These results suggest that finer grada-
tion of Native American ancestry has important implications for unraveling of disease etiology
and disease prevention.

 Methods
Ethics statement
Ethics approval was obtained from the Medical Faculties of the Universidad de Chile (approval
#123–2012) and the Pontificia Universidad Cato
´lica de Chile (#11–159), and from Universidad
de Tarapaca
´ and University College London as previously described in Ruiz-Linares et al. [13].
All participants provided written informed consent prior to participation. Structured ques-
tionnaires applied to volunteers of the aggregate-data and validation studies are available upon
request.
Reference individuals, and subjects in the aggregate-data and validation
studies
Surrogates of African and European ancestry were 87 Yorubans in Ibadan, Nigeria, and 80
Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry from the 1000 Genome Project
[39]. Native American reference individuals were 64 samples from the Americas in the
Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) [40]. Nine Mapuche and nine Aymara individuals
were selected to represent the two largest indigenous peoples in Chile based on the three fol-
lowing criteria: four grandparental Mapuche or Aymara surnames, estimated Native American
proportion of at least 74% for Mapuche and at least 99% for Aymara reference individuals, and
mitochondrial DNA haplogroups consistent with Mapuche (haplogroup C or D) or Aymara
(haplogroup B) descent [41].
Table 1 shows demographic characteristics of the 1805 individuals in the aggregate-data
study. The median age of study participants was 27 years and 39% were women. 2% belonged
to the ABC1 socioeconomic group (high middle class) and 27% to the D/E stratum (semi- and
un-skilled manual occupations, unemployed and lowest grade occupations). The Chilean
regions with the largest numbers of participants were De Arica y Parinacota (44% of subjects),
Metropolitana de Santiago (17%) and Del Biobı
´o (9%). About 2/3 of recruited subjects were
professional soldiers, with a relatively large proportion of men born in the south of Chile (Del
Maule, Del Biobı
´o and De la Araucanı
´a regions). Traditionally, the majority of professional
soldiers are recruited from among the middle classes, with minorities from the social elite
(officer corps) and the lowest socioeconomic groups (illiterate citizens), representing well the
general Chilean population. Part of the aggregate-data collective has been previously described
by Ruiz-Linares et al. [13].
The individual-data study to validate the observed association between Mapuche ancestry
and gallbladder cancer included baseline and genotype information from 234 persons, includ-
ing 64 gallbladder cancer cases, four families with multiple affected members (N = 16 subjects)
and 154 healthy individuals without a family history of GBC matched to cases by gender and
region. Part of this validation collective has been previously described by Koshiol et al. [18]
Table 4 shows selected characteristics of individuals in the validation study, and Fig 4D depicts
the four family pedigrees.
Aggregated mortality and incidence data was obtained from the Chilean Department of Sta-
tistics and Health information (www.deis.cl). We considered 639,789 deaths in total registered
between 2005 and 2011. Causes of death were grouped according to the tenth version of the
International Classification of Diseases (www.who.int/classifications/icd/, ICD10). Chile is
divided into fifteen regions, which are the first-level administrative division. Age-standardized
mortality and incidence rates were calculated for each region with respect to the Chilean popula-
tion census data from 2002. Only groups of diseases causing at least 100 deaths in Chile between
2005 and 2011 were considered, resulting in around 500 investigated ICD10-categories.

 Genotyping and quality control
Blood samples were collected by certified phlebotomists and trained nurses. DNA was
extracted following standard laboratory procedures. Participants in the aggregate-data study
were genotyped with Illumina’s Human610-Quad beadchip and participants in the valida-
tion study with Illumina’s OmniExpress array. Both arrays include at least 700,000 genome-
wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Intentional duplicates and arrays with more
than 5% missing genotypes were excluded. Genetic variants were filtered to exclude non-
autosomal polymorphisms, variants with a missing call rate over 5%, and also variants with a
minor allele frequency under 5%. After linkage disequilibrium-pruning at r2 higher than 0.1,
more than 35,000 variants were used for the subsequent genetic principal component and
ancestry analyses.
Genetic principal component analysis and estimation of ancestry
components in the aggregate-data and validation studies
Genetic principal component analyses were conducted using the eigenstrat function available
at www.popgen.dk/software/index.php/Rscripts [42]. The ADMIXTURE software was used
for supervised estimation of individual African, European, Native American, Mapuche and
Aymara ancestry components relying on the above described references [17]. In particular,
Native American surrogates were either the 64 American HGDP samples, or the nine Mapu-
che and nine Aymara selected references, both combined and in two separated groups.
Statistical analyses
The relationship between genetic ancestry and aggregated mortality data was investigated by
multiple linear regression to estimate the expected regional ancestry proportions, followed by
multiple Poisson regression to quantify the association between regional mortality rates and
expected ancestry components [28]. Expected regional ancestry proportions were estimated
using the model:
E½XjZ� ¼ ZTd ;
where each ancestry proportion X depends on the product of a design matrix Z times a fixed-
effect vector d, which includes an intercept and the response variables age, gender, educational
level, socioeconomic status, salary and region, using the categories listed in Table 1. A stepwise
forward model selection was carried out to identify the fixed factors most significantly associ-
ated with each ancestry component, fixing the significance level for entrance and for staying in
the model to 0.1.
After building the linear regression model, multiple Poisson regression:
Y � PoiðmÞ; with logðmÞ ¼ bE½XjZ� þ ~
Za þ ε;
was used to estimate standardized mortality ratios per 1% increase in ancestry proportions
(exp(β)), treating repeatedly measured (once per year) disease-specific 2002-standardized
mortality rates as response variable Y, and an intercept, gender and region as explanatory vari-
ables (region-level design matrix ~
Z multiplied by the fixed-effect vector α), assuming a stan-
dard variance component covariance structure. Summing up, the relationship between genetic
ancestry and aggregated mortality data was adjusted for potential confounders at both the
individual level (linear regression) and regional level (Poisson regression).
Individual-data to validate the association between Mapuche ancestry and gallbladder can-
cer was analyzed by univariate Cox regression. Gallbladder-cancer-free survival was defined as

 the time interval between birth and diagnosis with gallbladder cancer, unaffected subjects at
the time of interview were considered censored. Gender, educational level, region and individ-
ual Mapuche proportion were taken into account as explanatory variables using the categories
listed in Table 4.
Sensitivity analyses
In order to examine the robustness of regional ancestry estimates against possible outliers, sub-
jects were excluded one by one, and the corresponding estimated regional ancestry propor-
tions were visually inspected.
The impact of the differential number of individuals per region (e.g., De Arica y Parinacota
N = 794, De Magallanes y de la Anta
´rtica Chilena N = 5) on the estimated standardized mortal-
ity ratios for gallbladder cancer was evaluated by resampling. Regional ancestry estimates were
assumed to be normally distributed with means equal to the expected regional ancestry pro-
portions, and variances proportional to the corresponding standard errors. After drawing
50,000 samples from the corresponding normal distributions, standardized mortality rates
were estimated and summarized by the median, 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles.
Estimated Native American proportions were relatively low for some Mapuche reference
individuals (minimum 74%). In order to investigate the sensitivity of results to these low pro-
portions, we filtered out variants of likely European descent in Mapuche reference individuals
and reran statistical analyses. In detail, we calculated 80% confidence intervals (CIs) of the
minor allele frequency in European, HGDP and Mapuche reference individuals. Variants with
overlapping 80% CIs in European and HGDP reference groups, and with overlapping 80% CIs
in European and Mapuche reference individuals were excluded from subsequent sensitivity
analyses. This filtering resulted in more than 18000 selected variants after LD pruning, which
artificially increased the Native American proportion of Mapuche reference individuals to
98% at least.
In order to disentangle possible mortality-ancestry associations attributable to collinearity
among the ancestry components—the sum of African, European, Mapuche and Aymara pro-
portions equals 100%—we conducted a stepwise forward model selection to identify the most
significantly associated ancestry components. The significance level for entry and for staying
in the model was set to 0.1. Model selection results were visualized in a Venn diagram.
To apportion the relative contributions of Mapuche ancestry and access to the Chilean
health system, 2002-standardized hospitalization rates due to gallbladder removal were
included into the multiple Poisson regression model as additional explanatory variable (10
cholecystectomies per 105 person-years), and standardized mortality ratios per 1% increase in
ancestry proportions were re-estimated.
The inclusion of families in the validation study originated a dependency among observed
variables—for example, estimated ancestry proportions tend to be similar within families, and
consideration of actual incidence rates of gallbladder cancer may improve the accuracy of can-
cer-free survival estimates. The MENDEL software was used to take into account family rela-
tionships and real incidence rates of gallbladder cancer in Chile in validation analyses [43, 44].
Data was analyzed using ADMIXTURE version 1.23, plink version 1.90b3s for Linux, the R
software environment for statistical computing and graphics (versions 3.2.2 for Linux and
3.1.3 for Windows), MENDEL version 14.5, and SAS version 9.4 [42–45]. Computer code to
reproduce all described analyses is provided as supplementary material.
