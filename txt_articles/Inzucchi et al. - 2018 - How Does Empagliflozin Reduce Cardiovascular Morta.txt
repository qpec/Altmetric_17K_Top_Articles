Diabetes Care 2018;41:356–363 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dc17-1096
OBJECTIVE
In theBI10773 (Empagliflozin)Cardiovascular OutcomeEvent Trial inType2 Diabetes
Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) trial involving 7,020 patients with type 2
diabetes and established cardiovascular (CV) disease, empagliflozin given in addition
to standard of care reduced the risk of CV death by 38% versus placebo (hazard ratio
[HR]0.62 [95%CI0.49, 0.77]). Thisexploratory mediation analysisassessestheextent
to which treatment group differences in covariates during the trial contributed to CV
death risk reduction with empagliflozin.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Effectsofpotentialmediators,identifiedposthoc,ontheHRforCVdeathwithempagliflozin
versus placebo were analyzed by Cox regression models, with treatment group ad-
justed for the baseline value of the variable and its change from baseline or updated
mean (i.e., considering all prior values), each as a time-dependent covariate. HRs were
compared with a model without adjustment for covariates. Multivariable analyses also
were performed.
RESULTS
Changes in hematocrit and hemoglobin mediated 51.8% and 48.9%, respectively, of the
effect of empagliflozin versus placebo on the risk of CV death on the basis of changes
from baseline, with similar results in analyses on the basis of updated means. Smaller
mediation effects (maximum 29.3%) were observed for uric acid, fasting plasma glu-
cose, and HbA1c. In multivariable models, which incorporated effects of empagliflozin
on hematocrit, fasting glucose, uric acid, and urine albumin:creatinine ratio, the com-
bined changes from baseline provided 85.2% mediation, whereas updated mean anal-
yses provided 94.6% mediation of the effect of empagliflozin on CV death.
CONCLUSIONS
In this exploratory analysis from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, changes in markers
of plasma volume were the most important mediators of the reduction in risk of CV
death with empagliflozin versus placebo.
Empagliflozin, a highly selective sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor,
was the first glucose-lowering agent to demonstrate a reduction in cardiovascular
(CV) death in patients with type 2 diabetes and high CV risk (1). In the BI 10773

CARDIOVASCULAR AND METABOLIC RISK
 with empagliflozin versus placebo in ad-
dition to standard of care led to a 14%
reduction in the risk of three-point major
adverse CV events (MACE [the composite
of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarc-
tion, and nonfatal stroke]) (hazard ratio
[HR] 0.86 [95% CI 0.74, 0.99]; P = 0.04).
This was driven by a 38% reduction in
the risk of CV death (HR 0.62 [95% CI
0.49, 0.77]; P , 0.001) (1). The finding
led the U.S. FoodandDrugAdministration
to extend the indication for empagliflozin
to include reducing the risk of CV death in
patients with type 2 diabetes and estab-
lished CV disease (2). Empagliflozin also
reduced the risk of hospitalization for
heart failure (HR 0.65 [95% CI 0.50, 0.85];
P = 0.002) and all-cause mortality (HR
0.68 [95% CI 0.57, 0.82]; P , 0.001) ver-
sus placebo (1).
As with other CV outcome trials,
EMPA-REG OUTCOME was not designed
to determine the mechanisms under-
pinning its results. Several explanations
for the reduction in CV death with
empagliflozin have been proposed, in-
cluding hemodynamic changes related
to plasma volume reduction, a switch in
use of fuel, and direct cardiac effects
(3–9). The very early reduction in CV
death observed in this trial and the het-
erogeneity of the HRs for the components
of three-point MACE suggest that the pre-
dominant mechanism, at least in the early
part of the trial, was not primarily an atten-
uation of atherosclerosis, the traditional
consideration in CV outcome trials in pa-
tients with diabetes. The equally rapid re-
duction in the risk of hospitalization for
heart failure suggests that the cardiopro-
tective benefit of empagliflozin may be
related to improved hemodynamic status
(10). However, effects on atherogenic
processes, the myocardium, ventricular
remodeling, or vessel integrity cannot
be ruled out because the benefits on
CV death were sustained over the
course of the trial, and additional mech-
anisms may have contributed to the re-
duction in the risk of CV death observed
with prolonged treatment. In the cur-
rent exploratory post hoc mediation
analysis of data from the EMPA-REG
OUTCOME trial, we identified the ex-
tent to which treatment-induced changes
in specific variables, either alone or in com-
bination,contributedtothereductioninthe
riskofCVdeathobservedwithempagliflozin
versus placebo and, thereby, considered
potential mediators of this benefit.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Trial Design
The design of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME
trial has been described previously (1,11).
In brief, adults with type 2 diabetes who
were drug-naive with an HbA1c of 7.0–
10.0% (53–86 mmol/mol) or were taking
any background glucose-lowering medi-
cation with an HbA1c of 7.0–9.0% (53–
75 mmol/mol) and who had established
CV disease were eligible for inclusion. Pa-
tients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive
empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg,
or placebo. Glucose-lowering medication
was to remain unchanged for the first
12 weeks, although intensification was
permitted if the patient had a confirmed
fasting glucose level of .240 mg/dL; in
cases of medical necessity, dose reduc-
tion or discontinuation of background
medication could occur. After week 12,
investigators were encouraged to adjust
glucose-lowering medication to achieve
glycemic control according to local guide-
lines. Throughout the trial, investigators
were encouraged to treat other CV risk
factors according to local guidelines. The
trial was to continue until $691 patients
experienced an adjudicated primary out-
come event (three-point MACE). Patients
who prematurely discontinued study
medication continued to be followed for
ascertainment of CV outcomes and vital
status.
CV outcome events and deaths were
prospectively adjudicated by indepen-
dent clinical events committees (1,11).
Analyses of CV outcomes were prespeci-
fied to compare the pooled empagliflozin
dose groups with the placebo group.
Traditional Mediation Analysis
A traditional mediation analysis as ori-
ginally proposed by Baron and Kenny
(12) was used, taking the time-dynamic
evolvement of both the potential media-
tors and the outcome CV death into ac-
count. A variable must satisfy several
conditions to be a mediator of the treat-
ment effect. Treatment must have an ef-
fect on the variable over time, and the
change in the variable over time must
have an effect on the outcome. As an ad-
ditional condition, in an analysis where the
variable is included as a time-dependent
covariate over time, the effect of treat-
ment on the outcome (represented as
the HR) must be reduced compared with
the treatment effect in an unadjusted
analysis.
Analysis of the Effect of Treatment
on CV Death
The primary analysis of CV death with
empagliflozin versus placebo was based
on a Cox proportional hazards regression
model, with treatment group adjusted for
the baseline variables of age, sex, BMI,
HbA1c, estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR), and region, in patients who
received one or more doses of study
drug (1).
Analysis of Changes in Variables
(Considered Potential Mediators)
Over Time
On the basis of evidence from previous
studies, potential mediators of the bene-
fit of empagliflozin on CV death were
identified post hoc from the variables
that were measured and tracked in the
trial. Those chosen for analysis involved
several mechanistic categories (Table 1):
glycemia (HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose
[FPG]), vascular tone (systolic blood pres-
sure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP],
heart rate), lipids (LDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids),
adiposity (weight, BMI, waist circum-
ference), renal function (urine albumin:
creatinine ratio [UACR], eGFR according
to MDRD and Chronic Kidney Disease
Epidemiology Collaboration [CKD-EPI]
equations), volume status (hematocrit, he-
moglobin, albumin), and other (uric acid).
Potential mediators could be physio-
logical parameters conceivably linked to
the outcome (e.g., blood pressure) or bio-
chemical markers of such risk (e.g., LDL
cholesterol). To be a potential mediator, a
variable should satisfy the above-stated
conditions. Differences between treatment
groups in the longitudinal changes from
baseline in each potential mediator were
analyzed individually by using a mixed-
effects repeated-measures model to estab-
lish that treatment had an effect on the
variable. The model for each variable in-
cluded as covariates the baseline value
of that variable, baseline HbA1c, base-
line eGFR, baseline BMI, region, the last
week a patient could havehad a measure-
ment of that variable, treatment, visit,
visit by treatment interaction, baseline
HbA1c by visit interaction, and the base-
line value of the variable by visit interac-
tion as fixed effects. Because of skewed
distributions, triglycerides and UACR were
log-transformed before analysis. Each
analysis used all data available for patients
who received one or more doses of study

 drug and had a baseline and postbaseline
measurement for the variable in question.
Analysis of Potential Mediation of
the Reduction in CV Death With
Empagliflozin
Univariable Analyses
We considered that empagliflozin could
havea direct effect onthe riskofCVdeath
or could affect CV death indirectly through
itseffectsononeormoreoftheaforemen-
tioned potential mediators. Each variable
was analyzed as a time-dependent covari-
ate in Cox regression models with the out-
come time to CV death. The effect of a
specific covariate was analyzed by using
two approaches.
1. Analysisofthecurrentchangefrombase-
line to the most recent value available
before CV death, reflecting the acute
effect of the variable on the risk of CV
death. In the example below, the current
change from baseline in a mediator Y
(changeY) is calculated as the differ-
ence in the current value to baseline:
changeYti 5 Yti 2 Y0
2. Analysis of the mean value considering
all priorvalues(updated mean), reflect-
ing the cumulative effect of all prior
values of the variable on the risk of
CV death (see example illustration in
theSupplementary Data).Intheexam-
ple below, the updated mean of a me-
diator Y (upmeanY) is calculated as the
updated weighted mean, weighted for
the length of time intervals:

The mediating effect of the current
change from baseline in a variable, and
of the updated mean of the variable, on
the treatment effect of empagliflozin ver-
sus placebo with respect to CV death were
analyzed by using separate Cox regression
models, with treatment group adjusted
forthebaselinevalueofthevariableandei-
ther the change from baseline in the vari-
able or the updated mean of the variable
as time-dependent covariates. The models
provided the estimated HR for CV death
associated with a 1-unit increase in the
variable (current change from baseline or
updated mean). The results were com-
pared withamodeladjustingfortreatment
group alone (i.e., without adjusting for the
baseline value of the variable and the lon-
gitudinal values of the variable [change or
updated mean]).

Mediation Analysis of EMPA-REG OUTCOME Results
Diabetes Care Volume 41, February 2018
 Toberegarded as amediator, thetime-
dependent covariate should have an effect
on CV death; this was considered to be ful-
filled if the 95% CI of the HR did not include
1.0. In addition, the effect of empagliflozin
on CV death must be reduced in the analy-
sis adjusted for the time-dependent covari-
ate. Mediation was indicated if the HR for
CV death between treatment groups ad-
justed for the covariate (current change or
updated mean) was closer to unity than the
HR from the model with treatment group
alone. Complete mediation would be indi-
cated by an HR of 1.0 in the model adjusted
for the covariate. Percentage mediation
was calculated as follows:
Mediation % 5 100 3 lnHR 2 lnHRC
lnHR
where HR is the HR for the comparison of
the treatment groups in the model with
treatment group alone, and HRC is the HR
for the comparison of the treatment
groups in the model adjusting for the
baseline and on-study time-dependent
covariate values (change from baseline or
updated mean). The closer HRC is to 1.0,
the greater the mediation effect of that
covariate on the treatment effect of
empagliflozin on the risk of CV death.
Multivariable Analyses
Additional analyses investigated how se-
lected individual mediators from all the
mechanistic categories jointly contribute
to the effect of empagliflozin. Because
variables pertaining to the same mecha-
nistic category may be biologically and
statistically redundant, only the mediator
with the largest mediating effect in the
univariable analyses from each mechanis-
tic category was chosen for the multivari-
able model. A step-up procedure for
multivariable model building was used
to provide a ranking of the various mech-
anistic categories with regard to their
potential as mediators. In each step, the
representative variable from the mecha-
nistic category with the largest mediating
effect was added. For an investigation of
the statistical stability of the results, a
bootstrap resampling procedure was
used on the basis of 100 bootstrap sam-
ples (sampling with replacement) of the
same size as the original data set. The
unadjusted Cox model and the Cox model
adjusted for the final selected mediators
were fitted in each bootstrap sample. The
stability of the relationship between the
resulting treatment effect estimates
(logHR from the unadjusted and adjusted
models) wasgraphicallydisplayedandde-
scribed by linear regression.
RESULTS
Effects of Empagliflozin on the Time
Course of Potential Mediators
Table 1 shows the mean of each potential
mediator at baseline and the differences
with empagliflozin versus placebo in
changes from baseline at week 12 or
28 and week 164. Over the course of the
study, empagliflozin was associated with
small reductions versus placebo in HbA1c,
weight, waist circumference, uric acid, SBP
and DBP, no change in heart rate, and
small increases in LDL and HDL cholesterol
(1). An initial decrease in eGFR (CKD-EPI)
with empagliflozin was observed followed
by stabilization during prolonged treatment
in contrast to a gradual decline in eGFR in
the placebo group (13). Empagliflozin led
to significant reductions in UACR versus
placebo from week 12, regardless of albu-
minuria status at baseline (14). An initial
increase in hematocrit with empagliflozin
was observed followed by stabilization
compared with no notable change in the
placebo group (Fig. 1).
Effects of Change in Potential
Mediators on the Risk of CV Death
Inanalysesadjustingforchangefrombase-
line, models showed that increases in FPG,
heart rate, logUACR, and uric acid were
associated with an increased risk of CV
death, whereas increases in SBP, HDL
cholesterol, eGFR, weight, BMI, hemato-
crit, hemoglobin, and albumin were asso-
ciated with a reduced risk of CV death
(Supplementary Table 1). In analyses
that were based on the updated mean,
models showed that increases in HbA1c,
FPG, heart rate,LDL cholesterol, logUACR,
and uric acid were associated with an in-
creasedriskofCVdeath,whereasincreases
in HDL cholesterol, eGFR, hematocrit, he-
moglobin, and albumin were associ-
ated with a reduced risk of CV death
(Supplementary Table 2).

Versus Placebo
Table 2 presents the HRs for CV death
with empagliflozin versus placebo after
adjusting for the current change from
baseline in each covariate and the per-
centage mediation compared with the
HR adjusting for treatment group alone.
Treatment group differences in changes
from baseline in hematocrit and hemo-
globin mediated 51.8% and 48.9%, re-
spectively, of the effect of empagliflozin
versus placebo on the reduction in risk of
CV death. Changes in albumin and uric
acid mediated 25.5% and 24.6%, respec-
tively. The other potential mediators in-
vestigated, including HbA1c, FPG, weight,
BMI, SBP and DBP, LDL and HDL choles-
terol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, eGFR,
and UACR, had no or negligible effects in
these analyses.

after adjusting for the updated mean of
each covariate and the baseline value.
Adjusting for the updated mean of he-
matocrit and hemoglobin mediated
51.8% and 45.7%, respectively, of the ef-

the reduction in the risk of CV death. Ad-
justing for the updated mean of albumin

respectively. Adjusting for the updated
mean of HbA1c and FPG mediated 22.8%
and 29.3%, respectively, of the treatment
group effect, which were notably stronger
mediating effects than in the change from
baseline analysis (3.0% and 16.1%, respec-
tively). The other potentialmediators inves-

crit, representing the volume category
(proportion of the effect of empagliflozin
on CV death mediated: 51.8%). The addi-
tion of FPG as representative of the
glycemia category led toa proportion me-
diated of 70.9%. The addition of uric acid
increased the proportion mediated to
84.4%. Finally, the addition of logUACR
as representative of the renal function cat-
egory led to an estimated HR for CV death
with empagliflozin versus placebo of 0.931
(95% CI 0.732, 1.183) (Supplementary
Table 3), with the total proportion medi-
ated being 85.2%. In a sensitivity analysis
whereinhematocritwasreplacedbyhemo-
globin as representative of the volume cat-
egory, the estimated HR for CV death with
empagliflozin versus placebo was 0.927
(95% CI 0.730, 1.176), thus showing a sim-
ilar proportion mediated of 84.4%.
In the updated mean analysis, the re-
sultswere similar.The strongestmediator
was again hematocrit (proportion of the
effect of empagliflozin on CV death medi-
ated: 51.8%). The addition of FPG in the
next step led to a proportion mediated of
84.9%. The addition of uric acid led to a
proportion mediated of 92.2%. Finally,
the addition of logUACR led to an esti-
mated HR for CV death of 0.974 (95% CI
0.753, 1.261) (Supplementary Table 4),
with a total proportion mediated being
94.6%. In the updated mean analysis,
the replacement of hematocrit by hemo-
globin showeda similar result (proportion
mediated: 91.2%). Similarly, replacement
of the updated mean FPG by the updated
mean HbA1c resulted in 85.1% mediation.

CONCLUSIONS
Weconducted this exploratory analysis to
identify potential mechanisms underlying
the 38% reduction in the risk of CV death
observed with empagliflozin versus pla-
cebo in patients with type 2 diabetes
and established CV disease in the EMPA-
REG OUTCOME trial. Our approach used a
traditional mediation analysis (15,16),
taking the time-dynamic evolvement of
the potential mediators and the outcome
of CV death into account. This method
has been used by others to determine
or confirm the underlying mechanisms
behind a treatment strategy’s effect on
disease outcomes (17–19). Therein,
change in the point estimate of the HR
denoting a treatment effect is measured
after sequential controlling for a variety
of plausible variables, which are known to
be ameliorated with therapy. The vari-
ables that bring the HR closest to 1.0 are
saidtobethemajormediatorsofthetreat-
ment effect, suggesting, but not proving, a
cause-and-effect relationship. In the
Diabetes Control and Complications Trial
(DCCT)/Epidemiology of Diabetes Inter-
ventions and Complications (EDIC) study,
for example, improvement in HbA1c was
found to mediate essentially 100% of
the benefit of intensive insulin therapy
on the development and progression of
retinopathy (19). Such an outcome was
logical and expected because the goal of
that trial was to reduce glycemia, as mea-
sured by HbA1c, in an effort to reduce
long-term microvascular damage. In con-
trast, multiple mechanisms contribute to
the CV risk in patients with type 2 diabe-
tes. The precise contributions of individu-
al hypothesized mechanisms to the
reduction in CV death with empagliflozin
remain to be elucidated, and a mediation
analysis such as this may be used to drive
future research.
In the current analysis, changes in he-
matocrit (and hemoglobin) appeared to
be the variables with the largest impact
on the HR for CV death with empagliflozin
versus placebo. Therefore, these vari-
ables can be considered important medi-
ators of this benefit, mediating ;50% of
the treatment group effect. Results were
consistent in analyses that were based on

Mediation Analysis of EMPA-REG OUTCOME Results
Diabetes Care Volume 41, February 2018
 the current change from baseline or the
updated mean. For uric acid and mea-
sures of glycemia, modest mediation ef-
fects were found, with those ofHbA1c and
FPG appearing to be stronger in analyses
that were based on the updated mean,
which assessed the more chronic effects
of these measures. In contrast, the medi-
ation effects of other variables, including
changes in classical CV risk factors, such
as BMI, blood pressure, lipids, and other
parameters of renal function, were ab-
sent or negligible.
In the multivariable models, a much
higherpercentage mediationwas demon-
strated (up to 85.2% in the change from
baseline analysis and up to 94.6% in the
updated mean analysis). These models in-
corporated widely disparate effects of
empagliflozin, including those on hemat-
ocrit, FPG, uric acid, and UACR. These
data suggest that although the major in-
fluence governing the reduction in CV
death may have been plasma volume
reduction (as reflected in the increased
hematocrit), other variables may have
played more modest, yet complementary
roles, and multiple mechanisms may be
responsible for the reduction in CV death
with empagliflozin in patients with type 2
diabetes and established CV disease.
Empagliflozin is a selective inhibitor of
SGLT2 in the proximal tubule of the kidney
(20). Inhibition of SGLT2 by empagliflozin
leads to reduced renal glucose reabsorp-
tion and increased urinary glucose excre-
tion (21). Treatment with empagliflozin
reduces volume and sodium load through
its glucuretic, diuretic, and natriuretic
properties (22,23). The initial increase in
hematocrit with empagliflozin followed
by stabilization during the rest of the trial
likely reflect hemodynamic changes re-
lated to plasma volume contraction. The
same pattern was observed for changes
in eGFR with empagliflozin, whichalso are
believed to reflect hemodynamic alter-
ations involving renal blood flow (13).
The resulting decrease in circulatory
load, especially reduced ventricular filling
pressures and cardiac workload, could be
an importantmechanismbehindthe mor-
tality benefits seen with empagliflozin
(5,9). This finding is supported by the
observation that the most frequent
modes of CV death are those typically
seen in patients with heart failure (sud-
den death, death as a result of heart fail-
ure, and presumed CV death, the latter
designated when insufficient data exist
for the adjudication committees to
attribute a cause of death) (24). Although
only 10% of patients in the EMPA-REG
OUTCOME trial had heart failure at base-
line, the trial population comprised indi-
viduals with a mean age of 63 years, of
whom 76% had coronary artery disease
and 52% were obese. Therefore, many
participants in this trial likely had unrec-
ognized left ventricular dysfunction, par-
ticularly diastolic dysfunction, which may
eventually lead to clinical heart failure
with preserved ejection fraction (25).
Thus, a tenable conclusion is that a key
contributor to the reduction in CV death
with empagliflozin is the change in renal
sodium and glucose handling with resul-
tant reductions in fluid burden, ventricu-
lar stress, and risk of sudden cardiac
decompensation.
An increase in erythropoiesis could
be a complementary mechanism to the
hemodynamic changes reflected by an in-
crease in hematocrit and hemoglobin in
patients treated with empagliflozin. In-
creased erythropoietin and a median 7%
increase in red blood cell mass, measured
with 51Cr-labeled erythrocytes, were ob-
served in a small study (n = 30) of the
SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in patients
with type 2 diabetes (26). In a larger
study, a mean increase in erythropoietin
of 30–40% was observed 4 weeks after
initiating empagliflozin, which may be re-
lated to changes in blood flow between
the renal cortex and the medulla (27). The
extent to which this mechanism contrib-
utes to the CV benefits observed with
empagliflozin is unclear, however. Al-
though an improvement in tissue oxygen-
ation in a compromised cellular milieu
may be hypothesized to be beneficial,
such a robust effect on mortality would
be unexpected on the basis of current un-
derstanding of oxygen delivery dynamics
at hemoglobin concentrations within the
normal range (28).
Improvements in the updated mean
HbA1c and FPG explained 23% and 29%,
respectively, of the beneficial effect of
empagliflozin on CV death compared
with 3% and 16% for the current change
from baseline. In the DCCT/EDIC study
and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study
(UKPDS), CV benefits of intensive glucose
control emerged but only after a pro-
longed follow-up period (29,30). Unlike
the UKPDS and the DCCT study, which
were designed to achieve glycemic differ-
ences, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial
was designed as a glycemic equipoise tri-
al, and only a modest difference in HbA1c

 between the empagliflozin and placebo
groups was found. Furthermore, unlike
the UKPDS with a cumulative follow-up
of .10 years (30), trials of shorter dura-
tion did not convincingly demonstrate CV
benefits from this degree of glucose low-
ering(31). The smaller mediation effect of
glycemia relative to hematological vari-
ables, therefore, may reflect these factors.
Change in uric acid had a modest media-
tion effect (24.6% in the analysis adjusting
forthechangefrombaseline).Empagliflozin
reduces uric acid, possibly as a result of
the effect of increased glucose concentra-
tion on glucose transporter 9 in the baso-
lateral membrane of the proximal tubule
andresultingincreaseduricosuria (22,32).
Serum uric acid has been associated with
an increased risk of CV death (33), but ev-
idence is limited regarding the CV bene-
fits of reducing uric acid (34), especially
within the normal range and/or to the
small degree observed in the EMPA-REG
OUTCOME trial.
Limitations of the current analysis in-
clude that it was post hoc, and the results
can only be considered hypothesis gener-
ating, demonstrating possible associations
but not necessarily causal relationships. It
cannot be inferred that similar changes in
these variables achieved with approaches
other than empagliflozin treatment will
yield the mortality benefits observed.
Moreover, only variables measured during
the trial could be examined, and in addi-
tion to the potential mediators we investi-
gated, other variables such as reductions
in glomerular hyperfiltration (35), reduc-
tions in arterial stiffness and vascular
resistance (36), direct cardiac effects
through reductions in myocardial intra-
cellular sodium (37), and a switch in use
of cardiac fuel (4,5) have been proposed
as important. Finally, although the meth-
ods we used in the current analysis have
been used previously, they have not been
used in the context of CV death. CV death
encompassesmultiple subcategories with
potentially disparate etiologies that may
notbeinfluencedbythesamemechanisms.
In conclusion, this exploratory investiga-
tion into potential mediators of the reduc-
tion in risk of CV death with empagliflozin
versus placebo in the EMPA-REG
OUTCOMEtrialfoundthatchangesinhemat-
ocrit and hemoglobindostensibly markers
of the effects of the drug on volumed
appeared to be important mediators of
the reduction in mortality risk in univari-
able and multivariable models. Changes in
variables related to glycemia and urate
metabolism had smaller mediating ef-
fects. These, in addition to changes in
UACR, contributed in the multivariable
models, suggesting that the underpinnings
of empagliflozin’s CV mortality benefit are
likely multifaceted. In contrast, changes in
some traditional CV risk factors, including
obesity, blood pressure, lipids, and renal
function, made negligible contributions.
Ongoing studies, including mechanistic
trials, the EMPEROR outcome trials
(EMPagliflozin outcomE tRial in Patients With
chrOnic heaRt Failure With Reduced Ejec-
tion Fraction and EMPagliflozin outcomE
tRial in Patients With chrOnic heaRt Fail-
ure With Preserved Ejection Fraction)
that are evaluating empagliflozin in pa-
tients with heart failure with and without
diabetes (NCT03057977, NCT03057951),
and studies in patients with chronic kidney
disease (38), will provide additional phys-
iological insightsintothe cardioprotective
effects of this selective SGLT2 inhibitor.
