Abstract
Purpose To explore differences in opioid use across dif-
ferent adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) regimens, factors
associated with opioid use, and the impact of opioid use on
overall survival in female breast cancer patients treated
with AET.
Methods This retrospective study analyzed 2006–2012
SEER-Medicare datasets, following patients for at least
two years from the index date, defined as the first date they
filled an AET prescription. The study included adult
women with incident, primary, hormone-receptor-positive,
stage I–III breast cancer. They were also first-time AET
users, and fee-for-service Medicare enrollees continuously
enrolled in Medicare Parts A, B, and D. The main inde-
pendent variable was the AET regimen. We measured
whether patients used opioids after the initiation of AET.
Results After the adjustment of inverse probability treat-
ment weights and unbalanced covariates, the average
treatment effect probabilities of opioid use were similar
between those who used aromatase inhibitors (AI) only and
those used tamoxifen (TAM) only (56.2 vs. 55.3%,
respectively). Opioid use probabilities for those who
switched from AI to TAM were higher than those for the
TAM-only and AI-only groups. Opioid use was also sig-
nificantly associated with AET non-adherence. Opioid
users had a significantly higher risk of death (adjusted
hazard ratio [HR] = 1.59, p \ 0.001).
Conclusions Switching from AI to TAM was associated
with a high likelihood of opioid use. Opioid use was sig-
nificantly associated with AET non-adherence and higher
risk of mortality in female Medicare beneficiaries with
breast cancer even after adjusting for adherence.

Introduction
Pain is an important area of focus and intervention in breast
cancer survivorship care, mainly due to its high prevalence,
long persistence, and negative impacts on patients’ quality
of life. Pain can affect 25–89% of patients with breast
cancer along the disease trajectory [1–3]. Around 25–60%
of breast cancer survivors report chronic pain related to
cancer treatment, including surgery, radiation therapy,
chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy [2]. Adjuvant endo-
crine therapy (AET), including both AI and TAM, plays a
critical role in improved breast cancer survival. However,
AET-associated adverse drug reactions especially muscu-
loskeletal and joint pain, may compromise patient adher-
ence and result in reductions in treatment effectiveness. A
study of women with stage I–III, hormone-receptor-posi-
tive breast cancer found that concomitant pain medications
for AET-induced pain was associated with reduced odds of
AET adherence by 68% and increase the risk of early AET

 discontinuation by 2.5 times [4]. Johannsen et al. also
revealed that AET was associated with higher rates of pain
at both 15 months and 7–9 years after surgery [1]. In
general, AIs are more likely to be associated with muscu-
loskeletal and joint pain than TAM. However, patients
using TAM may experience delayed onset pain, and there
do not seem to be significant differences between TAM and
AIs in severe cases such as severe intensity of pain and
adverse events leading to hospitalizations or disability
[5, 6].
Differences in the safety profile between AI and TAM
may also contribute to the variations in pain treatment
patterns such as opioid analgesics [5, 7, 8]. A prospective
cohort study in Belgium found that 41% of 188 breast
cancer patients treated with AIs (n = 77) also used non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and/or opioid
analgesics, as did 24% of 104 patients treated with TAM
(n = 25) [9]. A retrospective analysis of the Tamoxifen
Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial found
that 14.29% of the TAM to exemestane group received
opioids compared to 10.40% in the exemestane-only group
[10]. However, the same analysis found that using opioids
seemed to have no significant impact on survival or
recurrence [10], and another study of patients with various
cancer types found that opioid use was associated with
survival [11]. Nevertheless, there has been limited popu-
lation-based research regarding the use of opioids in U.S.
breast cancer survivors treated with AET. Therefore, this
study used the SEER-Medicare dataset to explore differ-
ences in opioid use across different AET regimens, factors
associated with opioid use, and the impact of opioid use on
overall survival in female breast cancer patients treated
with AET.
Methods
Conceptual framework
We utilized the expanded Symptom Management Model
developed by researchers at the University of California,
San Francisco (UCSF) to guide the study design [12]. This
is a generic symptom management model for evaluating
three
dimensions:
symptom
experience,
management
strategies, and outcomes. This study considered opioid use
as one management strategy for pain and assessed its risk
factors and outcomes in breast cancer patients treated with
AET. As per the model, these three dimensions are influ-
enced by three domains: (1) the personal domain, which
comprises the individual’s perspective and response to the
symptom, including demographic, psychological, socio-
logical factors; (2) the health and illness domain, which
consists of the individual’s state of health and illness and
risk factors; (3) the environmental domain, which refers to
the combination of characteristics and context in which a
symptom occurs.
Study design, study population, and data source
This was a retrospective study from January 1, 2006 to
December 31, 2012. The index date was the first date on
which the patient filled an AET prescription, after which all
patients were followed for at least two years. The baseline
period was the one year prior to the index date. The main
data source analyzed was the SEER-Medicare linked
database; this dataset includes a large nationally repre-
sentative data source that contains clinical, demographic,
and health utilization and expenditures information on
Medicare beneficiaries with cancer. To analyze environ-
mental factors (county-level), we linked the county code of
each patient with the Area Health Resources File (AHRF).
We included adult female Medicare fee-for-service
(FFS) beneficiaries with a new and primary diagnosis of
breast cancer between 2007 and 2011 who met the fol-
lowing criteria: (1) cancer stage I, II, or III; (2) a positive
histology, cytology, or microscopic confirmation; and (3)
positive estrogen receptor status. Eligible patients had a
primary treatment for breast cancer (mastectomy or breast-
conserving surgery [BCS]) and newly initiated AET (at
least two pharmacy claims and at least 30 days of use in the
first year) within one year of the cancer diagnosis. We also
required eligible subjects to have a minimum two-year
follow-up period after the index date, as we wanted to
capture possible delayed onset of pain associated with
TAM, as well as possible switching patterns among AET
regimens. Inclusion and exclusion criteria details are pre-
sented in Fig. 1.
Based on the AET use pattern in our dataset, we cate-
gorized individuals in five mutually exclusive groups:
TAM-only, AI-only, switching from TAM to AIs (TAM-
AI), switching from AIs to TAM (AI-TAM), and those who
switched back and forth between TAM and AIs more than
once (mixed group). We identified the type of AET used
(TAM
or
AIs
including
anastrozole,
letrozole,
and
exemestane) using the national drug codes (NDC). The
University of Virginia’s Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approved this study.
Measures
Outcome measure: opioid use
We included the following oral and transdermal opioids:
codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, meper-
idine, morphine, methadone, oxycodone, oxymorphone,

 tapentadol, tramadol, pentazocine, as well as combination
drugs that contained the above opioids. We measured
whether patients used any of the above opioids during the
two-year period after the initiation of AET.
Outcome measure: overall survival and all-cause
mortality
We defined overall survival as the interval from the index
date (AET initiation) until death or the end of observation
(December 31, 2012).
Covariate measures
The analyses included the following covariate measures as
per the Symptom Management Model: (1) personal domain:
age
group
at
diagnosis
(B64 years,
65–69 years,
70–74 years, 75–79 years, 80–84 years, C85 years); race/
ethnicity (white, black, others); marital status (single [single/
separated/divorced/widowed]; partner [married/unmarried
or domestic partner]); dual Medicare and Medicaid eligibility
status during two-year follow-up period (dual-eligible,
Medicare only); (2) health and illness domain: cancer stage at
diagnosis (I, II, III); pain conditions during two-year follow-
up period (cancer pain, back/neck pain, headache/migraine,
musculoskeletal pain, arthritis/joint pain, neuralgia/psy-
chogenic pain, andother chronic pain);Charlson comorbidity
index (CCI) during two-year follow-up period (0, 1, 2 or 3,
C4) [13, 14]; depression during two-year follow-up period
(yes, no); and substance abuse disorders during two-year
follow-up period (yes, no); (3) environmental domain (at the
county-level): SEER region at diagnosis (northeast, south,
west, midwest); percentage of persons aged C25 with less
than a high school diploma (quartiles according to the
national county distribution); 5-year average infant mortality
rate in 2006–2010 (quartiles); average median household
incomein 2010–2014 (quartiles); 2010 unemployment ratein
those aged C16 (quartiles); metropolitan area based on the
2013 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS0 Urban–
Rural Classification Scheme) (yes, no); health professional
shortage area (HPSA) of primary care providers (PCP) in
2010 (whole county in HPSA, part county in HPSA, not in
HPSA); and (4) treatment-related factors: index year (2007,
2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011); breast cancer surgery type
(mastectomy, BCS); had radiation therapy (yes, no), had
chemotherapy (yes, no); index AET adherence measured by
proportion of days covered (PDC) with[
80% categorized as
adherence; use of other non-injectable prescription anal-
gesics including antidepressants, anticonvulsants, muscle
relaxants, NSAIDs, and other non-opioid analgesics (yes,
no); and use of opioids for at least 90 days (chronic opioid
use) prior to the initiation of AET (yes, no).
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics of variables were calculated using
frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. We
examined unadjusted group differences in AET types and
covariates between opioid users and non-opioid users using
cross-tabulation tables and tested significance using Chi-
square tests. Probabilities of opioid use for each variable
were presented. We also calculated marginally standard-
ized probabilities of opioid use derived from multivariate
logistic regression with all variables included [15]. The
tests of significance were based on Wald tests. Since there
were 448 cases with missing information about marital
status (4% of the final study population), 14 cases with
missing race information, and \
11 cases with missing
geographic region and treatment information, we used an
imputation technique (FCS discriminant function method,
SAS guide [16]) for the missing data in these cases.
We examined the effects of different AET regimen types
on opioid use using logistic regression. To control for the
pretreatment
imbalances
and
observed
selection
bias
among AET regimens, we utilized the inverse probability
treatment weights (IPTW) derived from propensity scores
via a generalized boosted model (GBM) [17, 18]. Noted
these covariates controlled were measured at baseline, prior
to the initiation of AET. This method can help non-ran-
domized observational studies to examine the causal
treatment effects of multiple treatments. In this case, the
GBM can generate robust propensity score weights with
better balancing than a simple parametric model such as a
multinomial logistic regression model [17]. The IPTW
method requires a model specifying the causal predictors of
AET regimen; the predictors were created from the study
covariates and limited to information reported during the
year before the index date (including treatment, diagnoses,
dual eligibility, and comorbidities). Average treatment
effects (ATE) were calculated from the weighted popula-
tion after the diagnostics were examined.
Furthermore, to explore how opioids may influence all-
cause mortality in female breast cancer patients treated
with AET, we used Cox proportional hazards (PH) models
controlling for AET regimen type, AET adherence, and
other risk factors including county-level information,
individual sociodemographic information, breast cancer
treatments, cancer stage, comorbidities, non-opioid anal-
gesic use, index year, chronic opioid use at baseline, and
number of months from initial breast cancer diagnosis to
two years after the index date. The method of direct
adjusted survival probabilities was used to produce adjus-
ted survival curves from the Cox PH model [19–22]. The
SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for data
analyses.

 Results
The study included a total of 10,773 women (shown in
Fig. 1). The average age was 72.3 years (standard devia-
tion [SD] = 8.7, range = [29, 103]). Most of the women
(89.7%) did not switch AET regimens during the two-year
analysis period; the percentages of using TAM-only and
AI-only were 13.8 and 75.9%, respectively. The mean PDC
(SD) was 0.78 (0.24); AET adherence rate (PDC[
80%) in
this population was 65.6%. Table 1 shows the study pop-
ulation characteristics and crude probabilities and adjusted
probabilities of opioid use. Most of the women were white
(84.4%), lived in the south or west regions (68%), lived in a
metropolitan area (81.3%), were single (57.3%), were
diagnosed with stage I breast cancer (60.1%), had BCS
(65.6%) and radiation (67.4%), and took non-opioid anal-
gesics (64.1%). During the two-year follow-up period,
56.9% of all women had ever used any opioid. The crude
probabilities of opioid use were higher in those who
switched AET regimens drug classes than those who did
not; however, after adjusting for other covariates including
covariates measured before and after the initiation of AET,
the differences in probabilities were not significant. Greater
adjusted probabilities of opioid use were found in those
who were not adherent to AET, lived in the south or west
region, lived in a county with a lower percentage of adults
with less than a high school education, lived in a county
with lower median household income, were younger in
age, were black (vs. white, others), had more advanced
stage breast cancer, had a mastectomy (vs. BCS), had
chemotherapy, had a greater number of or more severe
comorbidities, had a pain diagnosis, had depression, had
dual Medicaid and Medicare eligibility (vs. Medicare
only), used non-opioid analgesics, and used opioids
chronically prior to the initiation of AET.
Table 2 displays the results of the causal effects of AET
types on opioid use by applying the IPTW. We found that
AET regimens were significantly associated with opioid use.
After the adjustment of IPTW and unbalanced pretreatment
covariates, the average treatment effect probabilities of
opioid use for TAM-only and AI-only were quite similar
(56.2 vs. 55.3%, respectively). Those who switched between
TAM and AI had greater average treatment effect proba-
bilities of opioid use than those who did not. The significant
differences were between those who switched from AI to
TAM or mixed groups vs. TAM-only or AI-only.
Figure 2 illustrates the survival curve of overall survival
by opioid use. For the Cox PH model that adjusted for AET
regimen type, AET adherence, and other risk factors, we
found that opioid users had a significantly higher risk of
death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.59, 95% confidence
interval [CI] = 1.30–1.94, p \ 0.001).
Discussion
This study is among the first to compare opioid use across
different AET regimens in women with breast cancer using
longitudinal, population-based data. After controlling for
the observed selection bias among patients with different
AET
regimens,
we
identified
significant
differences
between AET regimens and opioid use (Table 2). Those
who switched from AI to TAM or switched back and forth
between AET regimens had higher chances of using opi-
oids than those who did not switch. But we did not find
significant relationships between AET type and opioid use
in logistic regression after controlling for all covariates
including before and after the initiation of AET (Table 1),
which may represent the direct effects of AET regimen on
opioid use after additional controlling for potential medi-
ators during follow-up such as AET adherence. The
inconsistent conclusions between the IPTW analysis and
logistic regression may be due to the different sets of
covariates adjusted for. Nevertheless, future research of
formal mediation analysis to elucidate this relationship is
warranted. Additionally, we found that non-adherence to
AET was related to a higher likelihood of opioid use, also
consistent with other studies. For example, a recent study
in a US commercially insured population with breast can-
cer found that non-adherence to AET was related to greater
use of opioid analgesics [23]. Another study also showed
that use of pain medications to treat AET-induced pain was
an important factor resulting in non-adherence to AET and
early discontinuation [4]. AET-induced side effects, espe-
cially musculoskeletal pain or arthralgia, were the leading
cause of AET non-adherence or early discontinuation
[9, 24, 25]. Despite the similar probabilities of opioid use
between the TAM-only and AI-only groups, we hypothe-
size that AIs are more likely to be associated with severe
pain that requires opioids given the higher probabilities of
opioid use in the AI to TAM group compared to the AI-
only or TAM-only groups.
Our study confirms prior findings that being younger,
having cancer in a more advanced stage, being single, and
having depression are all factors associated with a higher
likelihood of opioid use [26–28]. Our results also demon-
strated the relationships between opioid use and other
breast cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and breast
cancer surgery, yet we found no significant association for
radiation therapy. This may be due to less common pain
with
newer,
more
targeted
radiation
therapy,
while
chemotherapy-induced pain still seems to be prevalent
[29]. We also found racial and geographic variations of
opioid
use
in
non-metastatic
breast
cancer
patients
receiving AET. Some of the racial and geographic varia-
tions of opioid use in this population may be attributable to

 the differences in regional and provider opioid prescribing
practices, and functional polymorphisms in CYP19A1
[30, 31]. Nevertheless, the lack of strong evidence of
comparative effectiveness of AET in populations with and
without racial and geographic disparities may prevent
patients from optimizing the benefits of AET in real
practice. Therefore, future research is needed regarding the
causes of these variations as well as comparative effec-
tiveness of AET in populations with and without racial and
geographic disparities.
In our study, opioid use had a negative impact on overall
survival in women with early-stage breast cancer treated
with AET even after controlling for adherence to AET. The
relationship between opioid use and mortality may be lar-
gely attributable to cancer progression and escalating pain
that requires more aggressive pain treatments [11, 32].
Therefore, an escalation of opioid dosing over time is not
uncommon in patients dying of cancer [33]. The relation-
ship was also explained by an underlying biological
mechanism proven in animal studies [11, 34]. Prior to our
study, there had been no population-based research, to the
best of our knowledge, examining opioid use in breast
cancer patients treated with AET or how opioid use can
impact their health outcomes. A Danish population-based

 study of early-stage breast cancer patients (N = 34,188)
did not find a significant relationship between opioid use
and breast cancer recurrence, even taking into considera-
tion opioid type, dosing, strength, and chronic use [35].
Their population may be the most similar to ours in the
literature, but they did not restrict it to those with hor-
monal-receptor positive breast cancer who were treated
with AET. Nevertheless, more evidence about the impacts
of opioid use on health outcomes including survival and
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) may be necessary to
better inform pain management in clinical practice among
breast cancer patients treated with AET.
There are several limitations that require attention.
Firstly, due to data availability issues, we were unable to
know the actual indications for the opioids used, actual
patient experience of the AET-induced side effects, or
actual pain level assessment. Therefore, our hypotheses
regarding the reasons for the relationships between opioid
use and AET regimens should be tested by further studies
that can incorporate these data. Secondly, we did not assess
opioid strength, dosing, or cumulative dosing. Further
research is warranted to determine if differences may still
exist among AET regimens if the strengths, dosing, and
cumulative dosing of opioids are also assessed. Thirdly, our
study population was female Medicare FFS beneficiaries
treated with AET who were tracked for at least two years
after the initiation of AET; therefore, generalizing the
results to other populations requires caution.
Despite the limitations, the use of longitudinal, popu-
lation-based, cross-setting data; the expanded Symptom
Management Conceptual Model; and advanced statistical
techniques such as IPTW allowed us to undertake a
detailed examination of opioid use in this population. The
findings of this study further underscore the importance of
managing pain among breast cancer patients treated with
AET to maximize treatment benefits. It is important for
clinicians to identify patients with a high risk of AET-
induced pain and educate and empower patients about
preventive and pain management strategies when initiating
AET. During the treatment period of AET, it may be
especially critical for clinicians to closely monitor and
regularly assess patients’ pain to prevent potential non-
adherence or early discontinuation of AET. It is also
important to conduct opioid risk screening and monitoring
prior to the start of opioids in this population.
Conclusion
This population-based study using SEER-Medicare data
found that switching from AI to TAM was associated with

 significantly associated with AET non-adherence and
higher risk of mortality in female Medicare beneficiaries
with breast cancer even after adjusting for adherence.
Long-term use of AET is recommended in hormone-re-
ceptor-positive breast cancer patients, and adherence to and
persistence with AET is necessary for it to be effective;
better management of pain may be integral to improving
adherence and achieving better health outcomes.
