Zika virus RNA presence in serum, whole-blood and 
urine samples from six Israeli travellers symptomatic 
for Zika virus disease was examined. Whole-blood 
samples were positive for as late as 2 months (58 
days) post-symptom onset, longer than for urine (26 
days) and serum (3 days). These findings suggest the 
utility of whole blood in Zika infection diagnosis.
The ongoing Zika epidemic was recently declared 
by the World Health Organization as a Public Health 
Emergency of International Concern [1]. Laboratory 
diagnosis of Zika virus infection is thus important, but 
remains however challenging, due to a limited time 
window of possible virus detection, whereby patients 
tested more than one to two weeks post-symptom 
onset are difficult to diagnose [2-4]. There is there-
fore a need for an accurate diagnostic approach that 
will prolong the diagnostic period. We examined the 
utility of whole blood (WB) samples for detecting Zika 
virus RNA, compared with serum, or urine samples. Our 
findings suggest that Zika virus-RNA can be found in 
WB for a longer period than in serum and urine. More 
importantly, we show that Zika virus RNA can be identi-
fied in WB as late as 2 months after the onset of Zika 
virus disease (ZVD) symptoms.
Zika virus RNA in serum, urine and whole 
blood
All patients suspected of being infected with Zika 
virus were diagnosed at the National Center for 
Zoonotic Viruses, which is part of the Central Virology 
Laboratory (CVL) of the Israel Ministry of Health and is 
the reference laboratory for the diagnosis of arboviral 
infections in Israel. From December 2015 to April 2016, 
145 patients returning to Israel after travel to Zika virus 
endemic areas, were respectively tested for the virus 
by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on 
different clinical specimens. Altogether 423 tests were 
performed; 158 on sera, 135 on WB and 130 on urine 
samples. Ten samples from six patients were positive 
for Zika virus RNA (Table).
The six patients were aged 3 to 61 years and two of 
them were male. All had symptoms compatible with 
ZVD; fever (≥38°C), rash, conjunctivitis and arthralgia 
[5]. A serum sample had initially been obtained from 
each patient, while a follow-up serum sample, as well 
as urine and WB specimens were only available for five 
patients.
Testing for the presence of Zika virus RNA in the 
respective initial serum samples was conducted for all 
six patients, whereby the qRT-PCR was only positive for 
one of these samples, which was drawn 3 days post-
symptom onset. The other five initial serum samples, 
which were qRT-PCR negative, were drawn 5 days or 
more after onset of symptoms. For five initial serum 
samples, the amount of serum was sufficient to also 
investigate the presence of Zika virus antibodies by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Of these 
five samples, four were IgM positive, including three 
who were also IgG positive.
Urine was positive in three samples obtained from 
three patients 5 to 26 days post-symptom onset, and 
for these patients a second respective urine sample 
dated 46 days or later after the start of symptoms 
was negative. In contrast, all five patients with WB 
examined, tested positive in a total of six samples 
obtained 5 to 58 days post-symptom onset (Table). In 
two patients, WB remained positive for as long as 46 
(patient 5) and 58 days (patient 4) after the onset of 
symptoms (Table). For patient 4, a urine sample was 
comparatively negative already at 10 days after the 
symptoms began, while for patient 5, one urine sam-
ple obtained 26 days following the start of ZVD was 
 2

positive whereas a second urine sample dated 46 days 
post-symptom onset was negative.
Considering all urine and WB samples found positive 
by qRT-PCR in the study, the median amount of Zika 
virus RNA was 88 plaque-forming units (pfu) equiva-
lents/mL in WB compared with 16 pfu equivalents/mL 
in urine, despite the fact that the WB was taken at a 
longer time after symptom onset (Figure), suggesting 
that the quantity of Zika virus RNA is substantially 
higher in WB.
Most importantly, sequencing of part of the precursor 
membrane (prM) and envelope (ENV) genes (327bp) 
of the Zika genome was achieved from four WB sam-
ples. Results showed Zika virus RNA sequences with 
high similarity to those of strains identified in the 
likely geographical areas of infection (Asian lineage) 
[6]. Unfortunately, we were not able to isolate and grow 
infectious virus in tissue culture.
Laboratory investigations
For Zika virus RNA detection, total nucleic acids were 
purified from 200 µL (WB and serum), or 1mL (urine) 
of specimens by using the NucliSENS EasyMAG system 
(bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions with minor modifications. 
Briefly, MS2 Coliphage (10,000 copies/mL) was added 
to the lysis buffer to control for proper extraction and 
sample inhibition [7] and external lysis was performed 
on all samples immediately upon arrival at the CVL 
(which could be up to 48 hours after a sample was 
obtained from the patient) to inactivate the virus as 
recommended by the manufacturer. This was followed 
by nucleic acid (NA) extraction using the EasyMAG 
extractor. Extracted NA was eluted in 55 µL elution 
buffer and stored at -70 °C pending analysis.
The ABI Prism 7500 sequence detection system 
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, US) was used 
for the amplification and detection of the MS2 and 
Zika RNA by qRT-PCR as previously described [7,8]. 
Briefly, for MS2 qRT-PCR, 5 µL of RNA was added to the 
AgPath Mastermix (Ambion, Applied Biosystems Inc, 
Foster City, California), which contained 300nM of each 
primer and 200nM of probe and 5-carboxy-X-rhoda-
mine succinimidyl ester (ROX) as an internal reference 
dye, whereas for the Zika qRT-PCR assay, 5 µL of RNA 
was added and the specific primer and probe set for 
the ENV protein gene was used as previously described 
[8]. qRT-PCR was performed under the following condi-
tions: 30 min at 48 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and 50 cycles of 
15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Quantification of Zika 
virus NA in the tested samples was based on titration of 
Zika MR-766, which was kindly supplied by R. Lanciotti 
from the Division of Vector Borne Diseases, Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort-Collins, Co, 
United States. The limit of detection of the Zika qRT-
PCR method was between 10 and 20 pfu equivalents/
mL, in WB, urine, and serum specimens.
For sequencing of Zika RNA, a 327 fragment 
from the prM and ENV genes was amplified by 
reverse-transcription PCR using primers ZIKV 835 
(5’-TTGGTCATGATACTGCTGATTGC-3’) 
and 
ZIKV 
1162c (5’-CCACTAACGTTCTTTTGCAGACAT-3’) [8] and 
sequenced on an ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied 
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, United States) using an 
ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit 
(Applied Biosystems) [6].
Frozen whole blood (obtained 5, 26, 34 and 58 days 
post-symptom onset) and urine (obtained 5, 10, and 26 
days post-symptom onset) samples were diluted (1:10) 
in modified Eagle medium (MEM; Biological Industries) 
supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine 
serum (FBS), glutamine, non-essential amino acids and 
penicillin–streptomycin, overlaid on Vero c1008 (E6) 
for 7 days at 37 °C in 5.0% CO2 followed by additional 7 
days on fresh cells.

Serological testing for Zika virus was performed 
by using an ELISA IgM and IgG kit (Euroimmun AG, 
Germany) which detects antibodies against the Zika 
nonstructural protein NS1 [9].
Discussion
Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has 
spread in the last months throughout tropical and sub-
tropical areas of the Americas causing a widespread 
epidemic [10]. As it is strongly suspected that infection 
with this virus may in some cases result in neurological 
disorders as well as congenital abnormalities, accurate 
diagnosis is extremely important [1]. Due to the exten-
sive cross-reactivity between Zika virus and other fla-
viviruses in serology, which can lead to false positive 
results, serological assays have substantial limitations 
[8]. Currently qRT-PCR is the most reliable test, but the 
period in which zika virus RNA can be identified after 
ZVD manifestation is restricted. Following symptom 
onset, qRT-PCR detects Zika virus RNA for only up to 5 
days in serum [4], and up to 10 to 20 days in urine [2]. 
The use of saliva samples has been recently shown to 
increase the rate of molecular detection of Zika virus 
RNA in the acute phase of the disease but did not 
enlarge the detection period window [3]. Here we find 
that Zika virus RNA is present for a substantially longer 
time period in WB than in serum or urine and may even 
persist for up to 2 months post-symptom onset.
Despite the limited number of samples tested, the 
study clearly shows the advantage of WB testing. In 
sera, we could not detect Zika virus RNA more than 5 
days after onset of symptoms, and in urine, the latest 
detection of such RNA post-symptom onset for three 
of five samples was 26 days. In contrast, WB was 
Zika virus-RNA positive in all samples collected within 
the first month post-symptom onset, in three of four 
samples in the second month, and in none when test-
ing after 2 months.
The use of WB for flavivirus RNA detection is not new. 
Several studies, have demonstrated that a large pro-
portion of West Nile virus (WNV) is bound to red blood 
cells (RBCs) and have shown that WNV RNA concentra-
tions in seropositive donations are 10-fold higher in WB 
than in plasma and persist for a much longer period of 
time [11-13]. For diagnostic purposes, we demonstrated 
very recently that WNV RNA can be identified by qRT-
PCR in 86.8% of WB samples but only in 26% of serum 
samples during acute infection [14]. A higher detection 
rate in WB compared with serum or plasma has also 
been described previously for dengue virus [15]. Our 
current study suggests that Zika virus presents simi-
larities to other flaviviruses in this respect.
Virus isolation was unsuccessful for all WB and urine 
samples most probably because of the low amount of 
virus that was present in the samples. However, it is 
also possible that the virus was not viable due to the 
time that has passed from symptoms onset until sam-
ple collection. Future studies should investigate the 
possibility, raised by our study that Zika virus could 
circulate in the blood of infected patients for up to 2 
months. Diagnosis of recent Zika virus infection is 
important even after a patient’s full recovery, not only 
because of the possible risk to the fetus in pregnant 
women, but also considering reports that sexual trans-
mission of the virus from men to women has likely 
occurred [16] and the finding of the virus in semen 
for several weeks following infection [17,18]. Although 
our study establishes the utility of WB in the routine 
diagnosis of Zika infection, more studies are required 
to precisely determine the time frame of presence as
