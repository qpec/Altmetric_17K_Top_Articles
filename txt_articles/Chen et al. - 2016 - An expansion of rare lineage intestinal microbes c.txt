Abstract
Background: The adaptive immune response in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is influenced by an interaction between
host genetics and environment, particularly the host microbiome. Association of the gut microbiota with various
diseases has been reported, though the specific components of the microbiota that affect the host response leading to
disease remain unknown. However, there is limited information on the role of gut microbiota in RA. In this study we
aimed to define a microbial and metabolite profile that could predict disease status. In addition, we aimed to generate
a humanized model of arthritis to confirm the RA-associated microbe.
Methods: To identify an RA biomarker profile, the 16S ribosomal DNA of fecal samples from RA patients, first-degree
relatives (to rule out environment/background as confounding factors), and random healthy non-RA controls were
sequenced. Analysis of metabolites and their association with specific taxa was performed to investigate a potential
mechanistic link. The role of an RA-associated microbe was confirmed using a human epithelial cell line and a
humanized mouse model of arthritis.
Results: Patients with RA exhibited decreased gut microbial diversity compared with controls, which correlated with
disease duration and autoantibody levels. A taxon-level analysis suggested an expansion of rare taxa,
Actinobacteria, with a decrease in abundant taxa in patients with RA compared with controls. Prediction
models based on the random forests algorithm suggested that three genera, Collinsella, Eggerthella, and
Faecalibacterium, segregated with RA. The abundance of Collinsella correlated strongly with high levels of
alpha-aminoadipic acid and asparagine as well as production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A. A
role for Collinsella in altering gut permeability and disease severity was confirmed in experimental arthritis.
Conclusions: These observations suggest dysbiosis in RA patients resulting from the abundance of certain
rare bacterial lineages. A correlation between the intestinal microbiota and metabolic signatures could
determine a predictive profile for disease causation and progression.
Background
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune
disease characterized by inflammation of the synovial
joints. Genome-wide association studies have shown that
genetic factors contribute to RA susceptibility, with
genes in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
providing the strongest association and other genetic
factors providing additional risk [1]. However, low con-
cordance
of
RA
in
monozygotic
twins
indicates
involvement of other factors [2]—perhaps an interaction
between genetic and environmental factors—in the de-
velopment of RA [3]. An infectious etiology of RA has
been proposed for decades, although conclusive evidence
is lacking [4].
During the past decade, our understanding of the
interaction between microbes and host has evolved from
a passive commensal relationship to recognition that the
gut microbiota is essential for maintaining immune
homeostasis [5, 6]. Recent studies suggest that the aber-
rant immune response in RA may be associated with
dysbiosis of the gut microbiota [7–10]. Alterations of the
normal gut microbiome can affect mucosal immunity
with a consequent effect on extra-intestinal diseases like

 RA [8, 9], diabetes, and obesity [11, 12]. Differences in
the abundance of certain commonly present gut commen-
sals between RA patients and those with other rheumato-
logic diseases, as well as with healthy controls (HCs),
suggests the gut microbiota has a possible association with
RA [7, 9, 10]. A role for the gut microbiota in RA patho-
genesis is further supported by the success of antibiotic
treatment in some RA patients [13].
There is a growing realization that gut microbes and their
products may affect the adaptive immune response. Intro-
duction of segmented filamentous bacteria restores the
presence of TH17 cells and contributes to the onset of arth-
ritis in germ-free mice [14]. Mice carrying RA-susceptible
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes show a loss of sex-
and age-dependent changes in the gut microbiota that is as-
sociated with a proinflammatory cytokine profile in the gut
compared with mice with RA-resistant genes [15]. The
Human Microbiome Project and other studies have docu-
mented the diversity of the gut microbiome in healthy indi-
viduals and gut-related diseases [16–19].
Association of the gut microbiota with various diseases
has been reported, though the specific components of
the microbiota that affect the host response leading to
disease remain unknown. In this study, we show not
only an association between RA and certain genera but
also that the role of microbes in the pathogenesis of RA
is biologically plausible. Our observations suggest that
RA is characterized by an expansion of certain intestinal
microbes that are present in low abundance in non-RA
healthy individuals.
Methods
Patients’ samples
Patients attending the Rheumatology Clinic at Mayo Clinic
that fulfilled the exclusion and inclusion criteria were asked
to enroll in the study. Adult patients (aged 18 years or
older) who met the American College of Rheumatology
(ACR) 2010 classification for RA were recruited. The char-
acteristics of the study population are given in Table 1.
At the time of enrollment, any household first-degree rel-
atives (FDRs; n = 15) who consented and did not have any
symptoms of inflammatory arthritis or other autoimmune
diseases were also enrolled. Other controls (n = 17) in-
cluded sex- and age-matched healthy individuals with no
known history of autoimmune diseases. For convenience,
FDRs + HCs are labeled as controls in the figures. Any pa-
tient or control on antibiotics, consuming probiotics, or
having a known history of inflammatory bowel disease or
other autoimmune diseases like diabetes and multiple
sclerosis were excluded. All human studies were approved
by the Institutional Review Board of Mayo Clinic. Written
informed consent was received from all participants prior
to inclusion in the study.
Sample collection, 16S sequencing, metabolomics, and
bioinformatics processing
Fecal samples were frozen within 24 h of their receipt.
Microbial DNA was extracted from fecal samples using
the MoBio PowerSoil Kit with a bead-beating step. A
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using
50 ng cDNA and 0.3 μM V3-V5 barcoded primers tar-
geting 357 F and 926R with Kapa HiFi Hotstart Ready
Mix (Kapa Biosystems). Samples were pooled to equal
concentrations, then sequenced on one lane of MiSeq at
the Mayo Genomics Facility using the MiSeq Reagent
Kit v2 (500 cycles; Illumina Inc.), generating 20 M 2x250
reads. Pre-processed sequence files were then processed
by IM-TORNADO [20].

 Plasma samples were used for determining metabolites
by mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatog-
raphy in Mayo Metabolomics Core facility. These data
were only available for patients with RA and FDRs.
Methods for analysis of microbiome and metabolomics
data are detailed in Additional file 1: Statistical analyses.
Staining for tight junction proteins
The human intestinal epithelial cell line CACO-2 (ATCC)
was grown in vitro as per recommendations. Expression of
the tight junction protein ZO-1 was measured by im-
munofluorescence using a purified anti-ZO-1 antibody
(Life Technologies) as the primary antibody and fluor-
escein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) as the secondary
antibody. Expression of ZO-1 was observed using confocal
microscopy (Leica DM2500, LAS-AF) and the mean flor-
escence intensity of ZO-1 expression was calculated using
image J software.
Collagen-induced arthritis and treatment with Collinsella
Animal care and experiments were conducted in accord-
ance with the institutional guidelines and after approval
from the institutional animal care and use committee.
The HLA-DQ8.AEo mice used in this study have been
characterized and the collagen-induced arthritis model
in the HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice has been described
previously [21, 22]. Arthritis was induced in DQ8 mice
(n = 18) and, 2 weeks later, mice (n = 10) were treated
with Collinsella (109 bacteria suspended in 100 μl tryptic
soy broth (TSB), ATCC25986 strain VPI 1003, cultured
as per instructions) or with media every alternate day for
4 weeks during which time the onset and progression of
arthritis was monitored. The arthritic severity of the
mice was evaluated with a grading system of 0–3 for
each paw as described previously [21]. The mean arth-
ritic score was determined using arthritic animals only.
To evaluate the T-cell response to Collinsella-primed
dendritic cells (DCs), 10 days post-immunization, splenic
CD4 T cells sorted from CII-primed DQ8 mice (200 μg
of CII emulsified 1:1 in complete Freund's adjuvant
(CFA) were cultured in vitro in the presence or absence
of CII (50 μg/ml) and DCs (pre-cultured with bacteria or
supernatant of the bacterial culture). T-cell proliferation
was measured by routine
3H-thymidine incorporation
[23]. All experiments were done two to three times for
reproducibility.
Intestinal permeability
As gut permeability may be diet-dependent, all transgenic
mice were kept on a standard diet. Changes in intestinal
permeability were determined using 4-KDa FITC-labeled
dextran. Mice were deprived of food for 3 h, then gavaged
with FITC-labeled dextran (0.6 mg/g body weight). Mice
were bled and serum collected 3 h later. FITC-dextran
content of the sera was determined by using a microplate
reader with an excitation of 490 nm and emission detec-
tion at 525 nm as reported previously [15].
rtPCR for cytokine and chemokine expression
RNA was extracted from CACO-2 cells using RNeasy
columns (Qiagen) and cDNA was prepared using the
SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen).
Qiagen PAHS-073A RT2 Profiler PCR Array Human
Th17 Response plates were used as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. The data were analyzed as per the online
resources of the manufacturer from their Data Analysis
Center.
Colonization of Collinsella
Fecal samples collected before and at various time points
(3, 6, 24, and 48 h) after gavaging mice with Collinsella
were used to determine colonization. DNA from fecal
pellets was extracted and amplified using a commercial
kit (Kapa Biosystems) and PCR was done using specific
primers:
AERO-F (5′-CTTTCAGCAGGGAAGAGTCAA-3′)
AERO-R (5′-AGCCATGCACCACCTGTATGG-3′)
Statistical analysis
All of the statistical analyses were performed in R-3.0.2
(R Development Core Teams). Details are given in
Additional file 1: Statistical analyses.
Results
Disease duration and seropositivity are associated with
decreased microbial diversity
The study included 40 patients with RA and 32 non-RA
subjects (15 first-degree relatives (FDRs) of the probands
and 17 random healthy controls (HCs). High quality 16S
rDNA V3-V5 sequences obtained from fecal samples were
processed by IM TORNADO (median 122,028 reads per
sample, range 21,045 to 894,587) [20]. A total of 2188 op-
erational taxonomic units (OTUs), after removing single-
tons, were clustered at 97 % sequence similarity (median
54 reads per OTU, range 2 to 686,387) and assigned taxo-
nomic lineages by comparison with the greengenes 16S
rDNA database (version 13.5). The OTUs were classified
into 13 phyla, 26 classes, 40 orders, 76 families, and 157
genera. We first investigated the association of microbiota
α- and β-diversity with the clinical variables within the RA
subjects. α-Diversity determines the species richness and
evenness within the microbiota while β-diversity deter-
mines the shared diversity between microbiota in
terms of various ecological distances (Additional file 1:
Statistical analyses). In support of previous findings [24],
our data demonstrate a decreased species richness of the

 gut microbiota with increased body mass index (BMI;
P = 0.025; Additional file 1: Figure S1), although no signifi-
cant association with overall diversity was detected as
measured by Shannon index (P = 0.34). Association be-
tween increased rheumatoid factor levels and disease dur-
ation with α-diversity showed decreased species richness
for both clinical factors (P < 0.05 and P < 0.1, respectively)
and decreased overall diversity for rheumatoid factor
(P < 0.1; Fig. 1; Additional file 2: Table S1). Patients
using methotrexate (MTX) and hydroxychloroquine ex-
hibited an increase in species richness and diversity, indicat-
ing

with
treatment (P < 0.1; Fig. 1). Interestingly, MTX has shown
interaction effects with prednisone and is associated with
increased species diversity only in patients that receive
prednisone (P < 0.05, Shannon index; Additional file 1:
Figure S2). There was no association between α-diversity
and HLA-DR4, radiographic erosions, or Health Assessment
Questionnaire score (Additional file 2: Table S1). Disease
duration, rheumatoid factor levels, C-reactive protein levels,
and treatment with MTX and hydroxychloroquine were
associated with β-diversity, indicating that these factors
affected the gut microbiota structure.
The gut microbiotas of patients with RA differ from those
of FDRs and HCs
To determine if RA patients have a dysbiotic gut micro-
biota, we compared the 16S sequences of RA patients with
controls (15 FDRs with no autoimmune disease and 17 ran-
domly enrolled HCs; Table 1; Additional file 1: Figure S3).
UniFrac analysis demonstrated that the microbiota of the
FDRs was not significantly different from that of HCs
(P > 0.1), and the average distance between FDRs and
HCs was smaller than that between FDRs and RA pa-
tients (Additional file 1: Figure S4), indicating that dis-
ease
status
had
larger
effects
than
genetic
and
environmental factors. No significant correlation of the
microbiota between FDRs and RA patients (P = 0.40)
was observed. We thus pooled FDRs and HCs as a sin-
gle control group to improve statistical power and iden-
tify consistent change.
The phylum-level profiles for RA patients and con-
trols
were
rather
similar,
with
the
exception
of
increased number of reads from the phylum Actino-
bacteria in the RA group (0.45 vs 0.04 %, respect-
ively; Fig. 2a). Patients with RA exhibited a significant
decrease in gut microbial diversity compared with

Fig. 1 Disease duration and presence of autoantibodies correlate with α-diversity in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Two α-diversity measures, observed
OTU number and Shannon diversity index, were calculated based on the rarefied counts. a, b Duration of arthritis onset (a) and levels of rheumatoid
factor autoantibodies (b) in rheumatoid arthritis patients correlate with decreased α-diversity. The dashed line shows the fitted linear regression line with

 controls as observed by a decrease in OTUs and a
smaller Shannon diversity index (P < 0.05; Fig. 2b, c).
Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PER-
MANOVA) based on Bray–Curtis distance showed
that the structure of the microbiota of RA patients
differed significantly from that of controls (P < 0.001,
1000 permutations; Fig. 2d). Principal coordinate ana-
lysis based on phylum-specific Bray–Curtis distances
revealed that microbiota from patients and controls
differed much more in the low-abundant phylum
Actinobacteria
than
in
the
two
dominant
phyla,
Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (Fig. 2e–g). PERMA-
NOVA also demonstrated significant differences be-
tween the RA gut microbiota and the non-RA controls
(Additional file 1: Figure S5). However, this difference
was significant only in unweighted UniFrac (P = 0.02
and 0.4 for unweighted and weighted UniFrac, re-
spectively), suggesting that the major microbiota dif-
ference was in the presence and abundance of rare
and less abundant taxa [25].

 Expansion of rare microbial lineages characterizes the RA
gut microbiota
Using LFfSe analysis [26], we observed 26 differentially
abundant taxa at different taxonomic levels. The identified
taxa were highlighted on a cladogram to reveal the phylo-
genetic clustering pattern along with their logarithm linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) scores, which measure the
magnitude of differentiation between patients and controls
(Fig. 3a, b; Additional file 2: Table S2). Consistent with our
previous analysis, the abundance of the phylum Actinobac-
teria, along with its two genera, Eggerthella and Actinomy-
ces, was increased in patients compared with controls.
Eubacterium of the family Clostridiales and the taxonomic
clade Bacilli from the phylum Firmicutes also showed clus-
tered differences, with its two genera, Turicibacter and
Streptococcus,
expanded
in
RA
patients.
The
genus
Eggerthella demonstrated the most significant association
with RA, which remained significant even after con-
servative Bonferroni correction for multiple testing
was applied (P = 1.4e-5; Additional file 2: Table S2).
In contrast to the expansion of many low-abundance mi-
crobial lineages in the RA patients, only a few taxa exhib-
ited a
decrease in
abundance; the
common genus
Faecalibacterium had the largest LDA score. The relative
abundance of Eggerthella and Faecalibacterium were con-
sistently different between RA patients and controls (HCs
and FDRs), confirming the above observations (Fig. 3). To
address the concern of multiple testing, we applied a false
discovery control to the tested associations. At a false dis-
covery rate of 0.15, nine of the associations still remained

which are highlighted on the phylogenetic tree in cladogram format (a) and for which the LDA scores are shown (b). Red and green colors indicate an
increase or decrease in taxa, respectively, in the RA patients compared with controls. Among the identified taxa, the association of the genus Eggerthella
was the most significant and remained significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. The genus Faecalibacterium had the largest LDA score.

 significant (Additional file 2: Table S3; Additional file 1:
Figure S6). The potential association of Prevotella copri as
previously reported with new-onset untreated RA and
DR4 [9] was not observed in this cohort of RA patients
(Additional file 1: Figure S7).
We applied PICRUSt [27] to infer the functional con-
tent
of
the
microbiota.
Among
26
KEGG
(Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways tested
(Additional file 2: Table S4), the amino acid metabolism
pathway exhibited differences between RA patients and
controls; specifically, a decrease in OTUs with amino
acid metabolism capabilities was measured in RA pa-
tients compared with controls (unadjusted P = 0.03;
Additional file 1: Figure S8).
Predictive modeling of the gut microbial profile for RA
We next used the machine learning random forests algo-
rithm to construct a prediction model [28] (Additional
file 1: Statistical analyses). Due to its non-parametric as-
sumptions, random forests is able to detect both linear
and nonlinear effects and potential taxon–taxon interac-
tions, thereby identifying taxa that discriminate RA subjects
from control subjects. To assess the prediction accuracy,
we used bootstrap sampling to train the classifier and pre-
dict the class label on different subsets of samples. We
achieved a mean classification error of 0.38, compared with
0.47 based on guessing (Fig. 4a; P < 2.2E-16). The im-
portance of genera assessed by random forests generally
agreed with the single-taxon-based test (Additional file 2:

tion, which is a feature selection method built around ran-
dom forests and selects features that have significantly
more discriminatory power than random permuted fea-
tures [29]. The Boruta method selected three confirmed
genera: Eggerthella, Faecalibacterium, and Collinsella
(Fig. 4b). While single-taxon tests confirmed the differences
in the abundance of Faecalibacterium and Eggerthella in RA
patients compared with controls, the random forests also
identified differences in the genus Collinsella from phylum
Actinobacteria, suggesting the potential power gain of ran-
dom forests in modeling nonlinear and interactive effects.
The abundance of Collinsella was increased in RA patients
compared with controls (Fig. 4c). Hierarchical clustering
based on the abundance profile of the three confirmed gen-
era demonstrated that the samples from patients generally
clustered together (Fig. 4d). Random forests analysis of
species-level OTUs resulted in an even lower classification
error of 0.30 (Additional file 1: Figure S9a). Many OTUs
from the genera Eggerthella, Collinsella, and Faecalibacter-
ium were represented in the OTUs selected by the Boruta
algorithm (Additional file 1: Figure S9b, c).
The metabolome is associated with the intestinal
microbiota in patients with RA
The blood levels of 44 metabolites were measured in both
RA patients and their FDRs (n = 53; Additional file 2:
Table S6). The overall metabolomic profile differed signifi-
cantly between them (P < 0.001; Fig. 5a). No significant
correlation of the metabolome between RA patients and
their FDRs (P = 0.75) was observed, indicating that genetic
and environmental factors explain only a small percentage
of the observed metabolome variability. The levels of 11
metabolites exhibited significant differences between RA
patients and FDRs (adjusted P < 0.05; Fig. 5b), of which six
were present at higher levels in the RA patients. The me-
tabolome correlated significantly with the microbiota of
RA patients (P = 0.03). An association of the 11 differen-
tially abundant metabolites with the three Boruta-selected
genera showed an abundance of Collinsella correlated
with high levels of three metabolites (beta-alanine, alpha-
aminoadipic acid, and asparagine), while exhibiting an in-
verse relationship with allo-isoleucine (P < 0.01; Fig. 5c;
Additional file 1: Figure S10).
Collinsella enhances disease severity in humanized mice
The pathogenicity of Collinsella was confirmed in a human-
ized mouse model. Collagen-induced arthritis-susceptible
HLA-DQ8 mice were treated with Collinsella aerofaciens
(n = 10) and compared with untreated mice (n = 8). Mice
given C. aerofaciens developed arthritis with increased inci-
dence and severity compared with non-treated mice
(100 % incidence in treated vs 62.5 % in untreated,
P = 0.068), although disease severity did not differ
significantly (Fig. 6a, b). However, no colonization by the
microbe was observed (Additional file 1: Figure S11). To
determine the influence of Collinsella on the immune re-
sponse, we tested the antigen-specific recall response by
culturing splenic CD4 cells of type II collagen (CII)-primed
DQ8 mice with untreated dendritic cells (DCs) or those
that were pre-cultured in vitro with Collinsella (n = 3/
group). A significantly robust CD4 T-cell response to CII
was detected in the presence of DCs that were pre-
cultured with the bacteria compared with the response
with untreated DCs (P = 0.02; Fig. 6c).
Collinsella increases gut permeability by reducing the
expression of tight junction protein in epithelial cells and
induces expression of IL-17 network cytokines
For applicability to RA, a human intestinal epithelial cell
line, CACO-2, was cultured in the presence or absence
of Collinsella (Fig. 6d). Escherichia coli was used as a
control. Our observations suggested a significant de-
crease in the expression of the tight junction protein
ZO-1 in the presence of Collinsella as determined by
staining and mean florescence intensity (Fig. 6d, e) while
E. coli did not show a significant difference compared
with the media control (Additional file 1: Figure S12). To
determine if Collinsella lowers gut permeability, we com-
pared gut permeability before and after administering
media (n = 10) or Collinsella (n = 10) for 3 weeks. Collin-
sella administration led to a significant increase in gut per-
meability compared with pre-treatment (P < 0.05; Fig. 6f).
No change in gut permeability was observed with E. coli
(Additional file 1: Figure S12). We also determined if
Collinsella induced mRNA expression of Th17 regula-
tory network cytokines in CACO-2 cells (n = 3; Fig. 6g).
Compared with controls, culturing with Collinsella led
to more than a twofold increase in the expression of
interleukin (IL)-17A as well as RORα and chemokines
CXCL1 and CXCL5, which are known to regulate pro-
duction of IL-17 [30, 31]. Also, an increase in NFkB1
expression suggested activation of inflammatory path-
ways. These data suggest that an expansion of Collin-
sella
may
cause
an
increase
in
pro-inflammatory
conditions with a loss of gut epithelial integrity.
Discussion
Accumulating evidence suggests that RA is a multifactorial
disease dependent on an interaction between genetic and
environmental factors [32, 33]. The HLA-DRB1 “shared
epitope” provides the highest genetic risk factor for RA pa-
tients [1]. Environmental factors affecting mucosal surfaces
(smoking and infections) have the most influence on RA
pathogenesis [10].
There is growing speculation about the role of the gut
in systemic autoimmune diseases. Humanized mice ex-

 dysbiotic fecal microbiome compared with mice carrying
an RA-resistant gene [15]. A recent study detected an
abundance of the bacteria P. copri in fecal samples of pa-
tients with new-onset RA, suggesting a role for the gut
microbiome in RA [9]. Interestingly, an inverse relation-
ship between the presence of P. copri and the presence of
a shared epitope was observed, suggesting that this bacter-
ium may contribute to pathogenesis in a subset of pa-
tients. We did not observe a difference in either the
abundance of Prevotellaceae or P. copri or their associated
OTUs between RA patients and controls (Additional
file 1: Figure S7). In contrast to the previous study,
however, all the patients in the present study were cur-
rently on a treatment regimen. Association of disease sever-
ity measures with the gut microbiota of patients showed
rheumatoid factor levels and disease duration to be associ-
ated with the decreased species richness after adjusting for
various drugs used for treatment. Together, the present and
previous data suggest that cohorts with different patient
characteristics, including disease stage (i.e., early versus
established), activity, and geographical locations, may show
different microbial associations. Microbial metabolites may
provide a window to the functioning of the microbiota and
assume universal importance.

 Autoreactive T-cell responses and auto-antibody pro-
duction leading up to the onset of RA occur much earlier
than the clinical presentation of RA [34]. Since random
HCs possess different genetic factors to the RA patients,
we enrolled FDRs as additional controls so the major ef-
fects observed would be driven by environmental factors
or due directly to the disease process. This would help in
elucidating the expansion or contraction of specific bac-
terial clades in RA patients. Interestingly, FDRs did not
differ significantly from HCs in their fecal microbiota,
suggesting that differences in certain taxa, such as those
observed in the current study, may be dependent on dis-
ease state or factors other than genetics, although genetic
factors may contribute to an altered state of the immune
response. However, the sample size for FDRs was small,
which may have limited the power of analysis.
Our data suggest that the differential microbial com-
munity structure between RA patients and controls was
driven by differences in taxa, mainly the presence and
abundance of rare and less abundant lineages. The

 predictive model suggested that microbes belonging to
the phylum Actinobacteria play a significant role in RA
pathogenesis as both Collinsella and Eggerthella were
observed to predict the RA status. The abundances of
Eggerthella and Collinsella were not significantly associ-
ated with the three commonly used drugs, methotrexate
(MTX), prednisone, and hydroxychloroquine. These ob-
servations confirm a recent study that showed that dys-
biosis in the gut microbiome in RA patients is restored
partially after treatment with MTX [8]. The abundance
of Faecalibacterium showed a significant positive associ-
ation with the use of hydroxychloroquine (P < 0.05),
which does not explain the reduced Faecalibacterium in
RA. Overall, these observations suggest that treatments
are probably not the confounding factor for the identi-
fied associations. An important role for Collinsella was
confirmed both in vivo using a humanized mouse model
of arthritis and in vitro using human intestinal epithelial
cells. A recent study showed shared sequences between
Collinsella and DRB1*0401, suggesting that Collinsella
might contribute to RA via molecular mimicry [8], fur-
ther supporting the current observations that HLA class
II molecules can present self-HLA-derived peptides [35]
and mimicry with a pathogen can result in enhanced
stimulation and inflammation in certain conditions.
One mechanism by which Collinsella contributes to
disease pathogenesis is by increasing gut permeability as
observed by the lower expression of tight junction pro-
teins. Additionally, Collinsella influences the epithelial
production of IL-17A and the chemokines CXCL1 and
CXCL5, which may result in recruitment of neutrophils
and activation of NFkB, which has been observed to be
involved in the pathologic effects of a gut pathobiont
[36]. Recently, a multifactorial role of neutrophils has
been suggested in RA [37]. CXCL5 production by epi-
thelial cells in response to Bacteroides fragilis is associ-
ated with an inflammatory response [38]. Both CXCL1
and CXCL5 are increased in arthritis [39]. IL-17A, a
major cytokine involved in arthritis, upregulates CXCL1,
which is known to cause increased cell migration, angio-
genesis, and activation of the STAT-3 pathway [40]. Induc-
tion of Th17 cytokines systemically by Collinsella would
be informative about its role in arthritis but was not inves-
tigated in this study. Our data suggest that Collinsella
contributes to hyper-permeability of the gut by reducing
the expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1 directly,
as well as by producing specific metabolites. In support of
this, the abundance of Collinsella correlated strongly with
high levels of beta-alanine, alpha-aminoadipic acid, and
asparagine. Alpha-aminoadipic acid is a marker for auto-
immunity and age-associated changes in human collagen
[41, 42], while asparagine is a non-essential amino acid in-
volved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and blocking apop-
tosis [43]. Currently, the source of asparagine is unknown
in this study. Age-associated changes in collagen and
blocking of apoptosis could be involved in the autoreactive
response to collagen in patients, though these mecha-
nisms need to be proved.
Eggerthella lenta is another organism that was de-
tected with more abundance in RA patients, using mul-
tiple methods of analysis, but only rarely in controls.
Eggerthella uses ornithine as substrate to generate energy,
producing citrulline and carbamyol phosphate as bypro-
ducts. We did not observe any association between the
presence of Eggerthella and citrulline levels in the sera of
patients. However, it is unknown whether RA patients
carry higher loads of this amino acid or citrullinated pep-
tides in the gut. Based on the higher abundance of
Eggerthella in patients in the present study, we predict that
patients with RA may exhibit increased levels of citrulline
in the gut available for citrullination, against which anti-
bodies might be produced. Carbamyol phosphate is an en-
zyme that is involved in the pyrimidine pathway. This
pathway is upregulated in RA patients and typically treated
with pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors such as leflunomide
[44]. None of the patients in our study were on lefluno-
mide. While these data provide tantalizing clues, the roles
of these metabolites and rare taxa of the gut microbiome
deserve further study.
The gut microbiota of RA patients exhibited decreased
diversity with increased disease duration and seropositiv-
ity. This change in diversity stemmed from an expansion
of rare lineages like Eggerthella and from a contraction
of the common beneficial genera like Faecalibacterium.
Faecalibacterium is one of the most abundant Firmicutes in
the human gut that produces butyrate [45]. Butyrate is re-
quired for epithelial proliferation and mucin synthesis and
production, which helps maintain the integrity of the gut
epithelial layer. A decreased abundance of Faecalibacterium
with increased Collinsella may lead to an increase in epithe-
lial permeability, causing microbial fragments and products
to enter the sub-epithelial space and lamina propria. In the
presence of these conditions, a change in abundance of any
microbial clade that leads to an altered immune state may
cause local inflammation in the gut as well as outside the
gut. The Boruta feature selection algorithm and LEfse ana-
lysis also confirmed the significance of the differential pres-
ence of Eggerthella, Collinsella, and Faecalibacterium in
RA patients compared with controls.
Elevated BMI has a significant impact on the gut
microbiota of RA patients in this study. The distribution
of BMI was not significantly different between the pa-
tients and controls, suggesting obesity is unlikely to have
a major confounding effect on the differences in the gut
microbiota between patients. Obesity and elevated BMI
are associated with both the incidence [46, 47] and prog-
nosis of RA [48]. Therefore, restricting the sample of pa-
tients

 inappropriately limited the generalizability of our find-
ings, though we cannot exclude the possibility of con-
founding by BMI in this study. Future prospective
longitudinal studies are warranted to dissect the poten-
tial interactions of obesity and gut microbiota on the
pathophysiology of RA.
One can envisage that in a healthy state, dynamic micro-
biome structures based on sex, diet, and other factors and
driven by specific bacterial groups, maintain homeostasis
that modulates the immune response. In contrast, this kind
of microbial axis dynamism is lost in patients. Although
specific molecular mechanisms remain largely unexplored,
the results of this study suggest that susceptibility to RA
could be triggered by gut dysbiosis and alterations in path-
ways in which rare lineages are involved. However, the study
needs to be confirmed with a larger patient and FDR co-
hort. An interesting observation was the loss of sex-biased
differences in RA patients, as a healthy human microbiota
is sex-dependent [49]. In the present study, there were not
enough males in the HC group to perform an analysis of
sufficient power to evaluate this factor. Our studies support
previous data that showed a loss of sex bias in the fecal
microbiota of genetically arthritis-susceptible humanized
mice [15]. Further, similar to the humanized mice, expan-
sion of certain taxa was observed in RA patients.
Conclusions
Collectively, our data demonstrate that a dysbiotic gut
microbiota in RA patients, characterized by a decrease
in Faecalibacterium and expansion of C. aerofaciens and
E. lenta, could trigger inflammatory conditions in the
gut that depend on the production of chemokines and
IL-17A and compromise the gut epithelium integrity. It
is possible that the inflammatory conditions can be
modulated by prebiotics or probiotics. The therapeutic
potential of the only probiotics, lactobacilli, used as
treatment for RA is inconclusive, with some studies in
favor of their use while others did not show significant
improvement with lactobacilli using the American College
of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria for RA [50–53].
Our data suggest specific microbial clades may be viable
targets for therapeutic manipulation by diet, probiotics,
prebiotics, and/or beneficial gut commensals. Determining
the functions of the microbial clades that expand or con-
tract in RA will assist in developing effective means to tar-
get them.
