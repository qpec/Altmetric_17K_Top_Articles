Background-—Health insurance has many benefits including improved financial security, greater access to preventive care, and
better self-perceived health. However, the influence of health insurance on major health outcomes is unclear. Sudden cardiac
arrest prevention represents one of the major potential benefits from health insurance, given the large impact of sudden cardiac
arrest on premature death and its potential sensitivity to preventive care.
Methods and Results-—We conducted a pre–post study with control group examining out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) among adult
residents of Multnomah County,Oregon(2015 adultpopulation 636 000).Two time periods surrounding implementationofthe Affordable
Care Act were evaluated: 2011–2012 (“pre-expansion”) and 2014–2015 (“postexpansion”). Thechange in OHCA incidence for the middle-
aged population (45–64 years old) exposed to insurance expansion was compared with the elderly population (age ≥65 years old) with
constant near-universal coverage. Rates of OHCA among middle-aged individuals decreased from 102 per 100 000 (95% CI: 92–113 per
100 000)to85per100 000(95%CI:76–94per100 000),Pvalue0.01.TheelderlypopulationexperiencednochangeinOHCAincidence,
with rates of 275 per 100 000 (95% CI: 250–300 per 100 000) and 269 per 100 000 (95% CI: 245–292 per 100 000), P value 0.70.
Conclusions-—Health insurance expansion was associated with a significant reduction in OHCA incidence. Based on this pilot
study, further investigation in larger populations is warranted and feasible. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2017;6:e005667. DOI:

H
ealth insurance is an important factor influencing health-
care delivery and patient engagement in health care.
Uninsured individuals are less likely than insured individuals to
receivepreventive care, beappropriatelydiagnosed with chronic
medical conditions, receive care for serious medical conditions,
and report being in good health.1–8 Individuals who newly
acquire health insurance enjoy improved access to care, better
self-reported health, and greater financial security.1,9–13
Nonetheless, findings have been mixed regarding the role of
health insurance on reducing major adverse health out-
comes.13–16 In this study, we sought to evaluate out-of-hospital
cardiac
arrest
(OHCA)
incidence
among
a
middle-aged
population experiencing a rapid, community-wide expansion of
health insurance coverage as part of the federal Affordable Care
Act. OHCA represents an ideal health outcome to study given its
large public health burden and potential rapid responsiveness to
improved cardiovascular diagnosis and prevention.17–21
We hypothesize that OHCA incidence among the middle-
aged population (45–64 years old) has declined after rapid
expansion of health insurance, while OHCA incidence among
the near-universally insured elderly population (≥65 years old)
has remained unchanged. The feasibility of testing these
hypotheses was evaluated in a US metropolitan community
using an emergency medical system (EMS) database.
Methods
Population
Residents of Multnomah County, Oregon
(2015 adult
population 636 000) were studied using US Census Bureau
intercensal data to define population counts within each
prespecified age stratum.
OHCA Ascertainment and Incidence
A database of all EMS dispatches within Multnomah County
was queried to identify those for which EMS providers

 recorded a primary or secondary impression of “cardiac
arrest” from a prepopulated list of discrete variables. All
cases with noncardiac causes recorded in either the primary
or secondary impression fields were excluded (trauma,
accident, suicide, overdose, gastrointestinal bleeding) using
spreadsheet filtering, in a manner blinded to patient age or
date of arrest. On the basis of these exclusions, we
considered the selected cases to represent OHCA of primary
cardiac etiology.
Two
time
periods
were
evaluated:
2011–2012
was
defined as “pre-expansion” and 2014–2015 was defined as
“postexpansion.” The year 2013 was excluded as a transi-
tion year because of large-scale Medicaid and direct-
purchase private insurance enrollment efforts (with coverage
effective January 1, 2014 as part of the Affordable Care Act),
as well as large-scale changes in payment policy and care
delivery infrastructure (as part of implementation of Ore-
gon’s Medicaid waiver). Counts of OHCA cases by patient
age and year of arrest formed the age-based population
numerator for OHCA events in each time period of the study.
US Census Bureau assessments (census table “pepagesex”)
were used to estimate the age-stratified county population
during each time period. Numerators were divided by
respective denominators to generate the age-stratified OHCA
incidences for Multnomah County during each study time
period.
Socioeconomic and Insurance Characteristics
Socioeconomic
and
insurance
characteristics
for
age-
stratified subgroups of Multnomah County residents were
determined using the US Census Bureau’s American Commu-
nities Survey online search.22 Annual characteristics were
determined for 2011–2015. The following variables were
evaluated: proportion with less than high-school education
(census table B1501), poverty (census table B17001), unem-
ployment (census table B23001), and insurance characteris-
tics (census tables S2701, B27001, and B27010).
Statistical Analysis
Power calculations were performed using age-stratified pop-
ulation estimates from the US Census Bureau for 2011–2015
and OHCA incidence estimates from Oregon Sudden Unex-
pected Death Study from 2002 to 2004. Using PASS 13
software “test of two proportions in a repeated measure
design” function with autocorrelation level of 0.5 and a=0.05,
we estimated that the study would have >80% power to detect
≥15% change in OHCA incidence among the elderly and ≥19%
change among the middle-aged. Both were considered
plausible effect sizes.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version
9.4. Rates and their 95% CI were calculated using the function
“proc genmod” with a Poisson distribution. The differences in
rates and their 95% CIs were calculated using the function
“proc nlmixed” with a Poisson distribution. For statistics
directly reported from US Census Bureau summary tables, the
standard errors were back-calculated from the reported
“margin of error” (defining the 90% CI) by dividing the margin
of error by 1.645 and then multiplying by 1.96 to define the
95% CI. When multiple population strata were combined from
US Census Bureau data, standard errors were estimated using
simulation. For these simulations, the numerator and denom-
inator of each stratum was assumed to have a normal
distribution, with the stratum-specific standard errors derived
from the US Census Bureau 90% CIs as described above. The
simulated standard errors for the aggregated strata were
derived by sampling 100 000 iterations of aggregated
numerators and denominators that were randomly generated
based on stratum-specific means and their respective stan-
dard errors. In validation tests against Census-Bureau-
aggregated data, the simulation standard errors were within
30% of the actual standard errors.
This study was approved by the relevant institutional
review boards; informed consent was not required for analysis
of de-identified data.
Results
Overall Population and OHCA Incidence
The total combined population of middle-aged and elderly in
Multnomah County (age ≥45) increased from an average of
274 454 in 2011–2012 time period to 290 838 in 2014–
2015. The number of adult OHCA cases of presumed cardiac
etiology was 844 in 2011–2012 and 834 in 2014–2015
(accounting for 88% of all cases over 18 years old in the
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This pilot study shows an association between insurance
expansion and reduced incidence of cardiac arrest and
shows the feasibility of future larger-scale research.
• These results must be verified in larger populations with
information on preventive care patterns and potential
confounding factors.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Access
to
health
insurance
may
positively
influence
important health outcomes such as cardiac arrest, which
are responsible for a substantial proportion of deaths in
the United States.

 county). There was no significant difference in OHCA annual
incidence for individuals age ≥45 between time periods (154
per 100 000 [95% CI: 143–164 per 100 000] in 2011–2012
and 143 per 100 000 [95% CI: 134–154 per 100 000] in
2014–2015; P=0.15).
Age-Stratified OHCA Incidence
The middle-aged population (45–64 years old) experienced a
17% reduction (95% CI: 3.7–31) in OHCA incidence after
expansion of health insurance (Table 1). The elderly popula-
tion (≥65 years old) did not experience a significant change in
OHCA incidence across the same time periods.
Age-Stratified Population Insurance
Characteristics
Multnomah County rates of uninsurance declined abruptly for
the middle-aged, while the elderly remained stably, near-
universally
insured
(Figure 1).
Medicaid
expansion
was
responsible for the greatest reduction in uninsurance among
the middle-aged (Table 2). Medicaid coverage grew from 7.0%
(95% CI: 5.5–8.5%) before the Affordable Care Act to 13.5%
(95% CI: 11.5–15.5%) after the Affordable Care Act, a 93%
relative increase. Direct-purchase insurance increased from
8.2% (95% CI: 6.9–9.5%) before the Affordable Care Act to
10.0% (95% CI: 8.5–11.5%) after the Affordable Care Act, a
22% relative increase. Employer-sponsored insurance did not
change between time periods.
Age-Stratified Socioeconomic Characteristics
Changes in population socioeconomic factors between 2011
and 2015 were variable (Figure 2). Among the middle-aged,
the poverty rate was not notably different between time
periods (Figure 2A). Among the elderly, the poverty rate rose
from 9.0% (95% CI: 7.1–10.0%) to 12.2% (95% CI: 9.9–13.3%).
Education attainment was similar between time periods for
both age groups (Figure 2B). Unemployment decreased
among the middle-aged, consistent with national trends
(Figure 2C).
Feasibility of Pilot Study Design
OHCA event rates were efficiently ascertained from EMS
encounter data, with noncardiac causes of OHCA excluded
based on age-stratum-blinded review of the primary or
secondary impressions recorded by EMS providers. Age-
stratified population denominators, required to calculate
OHCA incidence, were available from publically available US
Census Bureau. Standard error simulations were required to
generate confidence intervals for some age-stratified insur-
ance and socioeconomic data.
Discussion
After implementation of the Affordable Care Act in Multnomah
County, Oregon, the middle-aged population experienced a 17%
decrease in incidence of OHCA of primary cardiac etiology.
OHCA incidence among the near-universally insured elderly did
not change over the same time period. There were no large
temporal changes apparent in socioeconomic indicators.
Among middle-aged adults, Medicaid expansion was responsi-
ble for the greatest reduction in uninsurance, while coverage
from employer-based insurance did not change.
This pilot study strengthens the rationale to study the
hypothesis, “Health insurance expansion reduces the inci-
dence of sudden cardiac death.” We demonstrated significant

 reductions in OHCA incidence among a population exposed to
abrupt expansion of Medicaid and private insurance during a
period of extensive payment and delivery innovation. At the
same time, a contemporaneous elderly population with near-
universal insurance experienced no change in OHCA inci-
dence. Prior studies showing notable improvements in
cardiovascular care after individuals gain access to insurance
support the potential for insurance expansion to improve
cardiovascular outcomes.1 A relationship between health
insurance expansion and reduced OHCA rates could explain
an important portion of the previously observed decreases in
all-cause
mortality
in
states
that
expanded
Medicaid
enrollment,15 since OHCA constitutes a large proportion of
overall
mortality.17,23
Finally,
future
studies
using
this
methodology could be used to evaluate similarities or
differences in the effects of private insurance expansion and
Medicaid expansion.24
There are potential confounders of these results; nonethe-
less, this pilot study serves the important purpose of showing
both the possibility that insurance expansion may affect
OHCA incidence and the feasibility of an efficient study design
using standard EMS data. Future studies could allow for
causal inference through the use of regression-based tech-
niques that include an interaction term for time period and
covariates that allow for identification and adjustment for
confounders. One potential confounder is improvement in
socioeconomic determinates of health. We have previously
shown that baseline population socioeconomic factors affect
OHCA incidence.25,26 However, among the elderly these
effects were blunted overall and were absent in the Pacific
Northwest (Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver, BC)26; therefore,
socioeconomic determinants of health are unlikely to have
significantly affected OHCA incidence among the control
group of individuals ≥65 years old. Among the middle-aged,
poverty and educational attainment were stable between time
periods. Unemployment among the middle-aged decreased
between time periods. Nonetheless, the significance of this
observation is uncertain since it is unknown to what degree
unemployment affects health outcomes when expanding non-
employer-based health insurance. In addition, it is unknown
whether short-term changes in socioeconomic factors influ-
ence OHCA. Another potential confounder is insurance-
independent improvement in patient- or physician-driven
sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) prevention. This could be
evaluated in future studies with use of adjunctive data on
overall cardiovascular preventative health care and risk factor
prevalence.
A possible explanation for health insurance expansion
influencing OHCA is through improvements in medical care
that could promote cardiovascular prevention and prompt
diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease. How-
ever, this potential explanation was not supported by a prior

 randomized study of Medicaid expansion in Oregon that
showed no change in physical health indicators.13 While that
study utilized very high-quality methodology that minimized
risk of bias or confounding, the covered populations and
Medicaid expansion programs were notably different from the
present study. Baicker et al evaluated a small group of
patients (n=12 229) throughout the state who participated in
a small-scale randomized Medicaid enrollment expansion,
whereas the present study evaluated the population of an
entire county during a large statewide insurance expansion.
The number of patients involved in the program studied by
Baicker et al may have been too small for health systems to
improve access, prevention, and disease management activ-
ities for newly enrolled Medicaid recipients. In contrast, the
large-scale
expansion
and
payment
reforms
that
were
engaged in Oregon after the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid
waiver implementation generated great attention and focus
on how to most effectively engage and care for new
enrollees.27–30
Despite general agreement that expanded insurance
coverage leads to positive health effects, the mechanism of
this benefit and effect on health outcomes remains poorly
understood. OHCA represents an ideal area in which to
investigate the role of health insurance on disease outcomes,
given its large public health burden, unambiguous mode of
presentation, and short-term responsiveness to treatment of
cardiovascular risk factors. OHCA is responsible for a greater
burden of premature death than any individual disease17 and
is responsive to evidence-based primary and secondary
prevention measures focused on coronary artery disease
and ventricular arrhythmias.
More effective outpatient preventive care is one of the
major proposed mechanisms by which health insurance leads
to improved health outcomes,1 and outpatient care is uniquely
important for preventing death attributable to OHCA, given
the 95% mortality rate after a cardiac arrest occurs.31 SCA-
targeted prevention with the implantable cardioverter defibril-
lator is a well-recognized approach to reducing arrhythmic
death.32,33 Other important approaches for reducing arrhythmic
death include improved cardiovascular risk factor modification
through smoking cessation and statin use, and improving
medication therapy for patients with recognized atherosclero-
tic
cardiovascular
disease
or
heart
failure.19–21,32,34,35
Given evidence showing that individuals who receive health
insurance engage more effectively in cardiovascular care,1 it
is plausible to consider that improved diagnosis and preven-
tion of cardiovascular disease resulting from expanded
insurance availability could explain the observed decrease in
OHCA incidence among middle-aged Multnomah County
residents.
Our study has important strengths. OHCA of presumed
cardiac etiology is a highly relevant outcome, since it is a
readily definable major adverse health outcome that consti-
tutes a major proportion of all-cause mortality.17,23 The study
employed consistent measurement methods that did not
change with time and were made by EMS providers unaware
of the study objectives. We studied a populous geographic
area exposed to abrupt, large-scale expansion of Medicaid
and direct-purchase private insurance; therefore, we could
capture adaptive or maladaptive effects of large-scale policy
changes in the context of intentional changes to the regional
healthcare delivery infrastructure.
Our study also has important limitations. As outlined
above, this was an observational study in a single urban

 geographic area that was underpowered for regression-based
techniques; as a result it should not be used to infer that
health insurance was the cause of the observed decline in
OHCA incidence nor that the findings would be consistently
generalizable to other regions. However, as a pilot study the
association observed coupled with a feasible and scalable
study design provides important justification for larger scale
investigations that could exclude confounders and allow more
robust causal inferences. Other limitations include our
assumption that OHCA of presumed primary cardiac etiology
as defined by EMS information from the time of arrest was a
reasonable surrogate for SCA that is defined by detailed
review of arrest-related and pre-arrest medical records. This
method may overestimate SCA magnitude if underlying
disorders such as pneumonia, sepsis, or cancer are not
known or coded by EMS personnel, while it may underesti-
mate SCA magnitude if conditions such as respiratory arrest
are incorrectly identified as the primary cause of OHCA rather
than as a symptom of acute ischemia or ventricular tachy-
cardia. While more detailed clinical information is required for
etiologic and mechanistic investigations of SCA, the approach
used in this study allows for efficient measurement of OHCA
incidence changes over time. Any miscategorization should be
consistent between time periods and therefore would not be
expected to influence the OHCA incidence changes that are
the focus of this investigation.
Conclusion
Community-wide
health
insurance
expansion,
primarily
through Medicaid, was associated with a significant decrease
in the incidence of OHCA among middle-aged individuals in
Multnomah County, Oregon. These results are consistent with
prior studies showing improvements in cardiovascular pre-
ventive care after the acquisition of insurance. Based on this
pilot study, further investigation in larger populations using
quasi-experimental analytic techniques is warranted and
feasible.
