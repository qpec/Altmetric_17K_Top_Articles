Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Young febrile infants are at substantial risk of serious bacterial infections; 
however, the current culture-based diagnosis has limitations. Analysis of host expression patterns 
(“RNA biosignatures”) in response to infections may provide an alternative diagnostic approach.
OBJECTIVE—To assess whether RNA biosignatures can distinguish febrile infants aged 60 days 
or younger with and without serious bacterial infections.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Prospective observational study involving a 
convenience sample of febrile infants 60 days or younger evaluated for fever (temperature >38° C) 
in 22 emergency departments from December 2008 to December 2010 who underwent laboratory 
evaluations including blood cultures. A random sample of infants with and without bacterial 
infections was selected for RNA biosignature analysis. Afebrile healthy infants served as controls. 
Blood samples were collected for cultures and RNA biosignatures. Bioinformatics tools were 
applied to define RNA biosignatures to classify febrile infants by infection type.
EXPOSURE—RNA biosignatures compared with cultures for discriminating febrile infants with 
and without bacterial infections and infants with bacteremia from those without bacterial 
infections.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Bacterial infection confirmed by culture. 
Performance of RNA biosignatures was compared with routine laboratory screening tests and Yale 
Observation Scale (YOS) scores.
RESULTS—Of 1883 febrile infants (median age, 37 days; 55.7%boys), RNA biosignatures were 
measured in 279 randomly selected infants (89 with bacterial infections—including 32 with 
bacteremia and 15 with urinary tract infections—and 190 without bacterial infections), and 19 
afebrile healthy infants. Sixty-six classifier genes were identified that distinguished infants with 
and without bacterial infections in the test set with 87%(95%CI, 73%-95%) sensitivity and 89% 
(95%CI, 81%-93%) specificity. Ten classifier genes distinguished infants with bacteremia from 
those without bacterial infections in the test set with 94%(95%CI, 70%-100%) sensitivity and 
95%(95%CI, 88%-98%) specificity. The incremental C statistic for the RNA biosignatures over 
the YOS score was 0.37 (95%CI, 0.30–0.43).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—In this preliminary study, RNA biosignatures were 
defined to distinguish febrile infants aged 60 days or younger with vs without bacterial infections. 
Further research with larger populations is needed to refine and validate the estimates of test 
accuracy and to assess the clinical utility of RNA biosignatures in practice.

 Febrile infants aged 60 days or younger are at substantial risk of serious bacterial infections 
(defined as bacteremia, urinary tract infections [UTIs], and bacterial meningitis), estimated 
at 7% to 9% in this population.1 Current guidelines recommend obtaining blood, urine, and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures, with consideration of antibiotic treatment and 
hospitalization until culture results are negative. Although these strategies aim to identify 
and treat all young febrile infants with serious bacterial infections, the costs and risks are 
high.2 The lack of an optimal management strategy has led to substantial variation in the 
care for this vulnerable population, unnecessarily exposing many infants to potential harm.
Culture of bacteria remains the reference standard for the diagnosis of serious bacterial 
infections, but cultures are limited by time to bacterial growth and false-positive and false-
negative results.3–6 A genomic approach based on analysis of the host response to infection 
has been investigated as an alternative.3,7–10 Microbial pathogens induce specific host 
responses or “RNA biosignatures” that can be identified using microarray analyses of blood 
leukocytes. Studies involving older children and adults have demonstrated the value of this 
approach to distinguish bacterial from viral infections.10–15 It is unknown, however, whether 
measuring host responses can discriminate febrile infants aged 60 days or younger with and 
without bacterial infections because their immature immune systems may not generate a 
sufficiently robust host response and because the duration of illness when they present for 
medical attention is short.
The objective of this preliminary study was to determine whether RNA biosignatures could 
distinguish febrile infants aged 60 days or younger with and without bacterial infections. We 
determined the performance characteristics of RNA biosignatures compared with standard 
bacterial cultures.
Methods
Study Design, Setting, and Population
This was a prospective observational study that included 22 emergency departments (EDs) 
in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN). A convenience 
sample of infants aged 60 days or younger were evaluated for fever (rectal temperatures 
>38° C documented in the ED, home, or clinic). Those who underwent laboratory 
evaluations that included at least 1 blood culture were enrolled. Febrile infants presenting to 
any of the 22 EDs when study research staff members were available were screened for 
study eligibility. The parents or guardians of eligible infants were approached, and their 
infants were enrolled upon receiving written informed consent. The study was approved by 
the institutional review boards at all sites. For this preliminary analysis, a random sample of 
enrolled infants was selected (described below).
The goal was to focus on infants who posed diagnostic quandaries; therefore, infants with 
clinical sepsis, prematurity, significant comorbidities, focal bacterial infections (except otitis 
media), and those already receiving antibiotics were excluded. Laboratory evaluations, aside 
from blood cultures and blood draws for RNA biosignatures, were performed at the treating 
physician’s discretion and typically included white blood cell counts, urinalyses and urine 
cultures, and CSF analyses and cultures. Based on culture results, febrile infants were

 assigned either to the bacterial infection group (bacteremia, UTI, bacterial meningitis) or to 
the without-bacterial-infection group.
Key Points
Question
Can the host response measured by RNA biosignatures distinguish young febrile infants 
with and without bacterial infections?
Findings
In this prospective observational study of 279 febrile infants 60 days or younger, 66 
classifier genes distinguished infants with and without bacterial infections with 
87%sensitivity and 89% specificity. Ten classifier genes distinguished infants with 
bacteremia from those without bacterial infections with 94% sensitivity and 
95%specificity.
Meaning
In this preliminary study, host RNA biosignatures accurately distinguished febrile infants 
60 days or younger with and without bacterial infections.
Study Definitions
Bacteremia and bacterial meningitis were defined as growth of a single pathogen in the 
blood or CSF, respectively.16 Growth of multiple bacteria or those not commonly considered 
pathogens (eg, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, diphtheroids, bacillus species) were 
categorized as contaminants. Urinary tract infection was defined as the growth of a single 
pathogen in the urine with colony counts (colony-forming units [CFUs]) meeting 1 of 3 
criteria: (1) 1000 CFUs/mL by suprapubic aspiration; (2) 50 000 CFUs/mL from a 
catheterized specimen; or (3) 10 000 CFUs/mL from a catheterized specimen in association 
with an abnormal urinalysis (positive for leukocyte esterase or nitrites, or >5 white blood 
cell counts per high-power field on microscopic examination).17 Patients were classified as 
having bacterial infections or not in a blinded fashion following study definitions, before the 
RNA biosignature results were available.
Training and Test Sets and Sample Size Determination for Microarray Analysis
Best practices for microarray analyses include 2 independent patient sets: one to define 
(training set) and the other to validate (test set) candidate RNA biosignatures. The initial 
goal was to define the bacterial infection biosignature, which would be different from the 
biosignature for infants without bacterial infections. Because there was no information 
regarding RNA biosignatures in infants aged 60 days or younger, the proposed sample size 
implicitly assumed that effect sizes (differences in RNA biosignatures between patients with 
and without bacterial infections) would be of the magnitude encountered in previous 
microarray studies in other age groups.7,18 It was estimated that 30 to 40 infants with 
bacterial infections and 30 to 40 without bacterial infections (15–20 for the training set and 
15–20 for the test set in each group) would be required to define the diagnostic 
biosignatures.19 To ensure that the analysis was not underpowered, additional cases in both

 groups of febrile infants were included. Because patients were recruited from 22 different 
EDs over 2 years, the samples analyzed constitute a diverse study population.
Infants with and without bacterial infections included in the analyses were randomly 
selected from the study population. To have a balanced representation of bacterial infections, 
the PECARN data coordinating center selected infants at random from the groups with 
bacteremia and UTIs. Febrile infants whose bacterial cultures tested negative were 
heterogeneous because not every patient was tested for viral infections. To represent the 
clinical setting, we divided patients without bacterial infections into 4 groups: those with 
proven viral infections, those tested for at least 3 respiratory viruses but with negative 
results, others tested for at least 1 virus and with negative results, and those not tested for 
viruses. Patients were selected from each group by the data coordinating center.
Each group (with and without bacterial infections) was divided into training and test sets at 
random, stratified by age, sex, and infection type to attain matched training and test sets for 
analysis. Following this approach, the RNA biosignatures were first identified in the training 
sets and then validated in the test sets.7,18 For comparison, healthy control afebrile infants 
with neither signs of acute infections nor antibiotic therapy in the preceding 2 weeks were 
also included. These infants were enrolled during primary care visits or at the time of 
elective surgery not involving the respiratory tract.
Study Procedures
For each patient, investigators prospectively recorded demographics, physical examination 
findings including Yale Observation Scale (YOS) scores, and laboratory results. The YOS is 
a clinical score that provides a quantitative assessment of risk for serious bacterial infections 
in febrile infants aged 60 days or younger based on simple clinical and observational 
parameters. It includes 6 items, with each item scored on a 1-to-3-to-5 scale, yielding a total 
YOS score ranging from 6 (perfect score) to 30 (most ill-appearing infant). A YOS score of 
10 or less is considered normal.20 Blood samples for microarray analyses were placed into 
tempus tubes (Applied Biosystems), frozen, and batch-shipped to a central laboratory where 
they were hybridized on Illumina HT12 V4 beadchips.18 The data were deposited in the 
NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO accession number: GSE64456).
Statistical and Microarray Data Analysis
Illumina chips were analyzed with GenomeStudio and GeneSpring GX 7.3 (Agilent 
Technologies) software.7,12,21 Analyses of RNA transcripts included supervised analyses 
(for class comparisons between predefined sample groups) and unsupervised analyses 
(unbiased grouping of samples based on their molecular profiles without prior knowledge of 
sample classification). To identify differentially expressed genes, Mann-Whitney testing (2 
sided) for comparisons between 2 groups (P values <.01 were considered significant) with 
Benjamini-Hochberg corrections for multiple testing, and a 1.25-fold or higher change in 
expression level were used.12,21 Functional analyses of differentially expressed genes were 
performed using modular analyses per infection group and per individual patient. Modules 
are groups of genes with similar biological functions.13,14,21–23 For these analyses, modular 
maps were derived independently for the training and test sets in both groups of patients

 (infants with and without bacterial infections) using the healthy control group as a reference. 
Modules related to interferon and inflammation genes are particularly relevant to identify 
differences in gene expression between infants with and without bacterial infections because 
these modules represent the major immune pathways activated in response to infections. In 
addition to the group analyses, a modular analysis for each individual patient was also 
performed.12,13,21–23 Next class prediction using the κ–nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm7 
was performed to identify genes that best discriminated between infants with and without 
bacterial infections in the training set and then validated in the test set. This was followed by 
a subgroup analysis, again using the KNN algorithm, to identify classifier genes that best 
discriminated infants with bacteremia from those without bacterial infections. Sensitivity 
and specificity of these classifier genes were calculated to assess discrimination first in the 
training set using the leave-one-out cross-validation method and then were validated in the 
test set.7
Sample proportions and exact (Clopper-Pearson) confidence intervals were used to estimate 
the test characteristics.24 The incremental C statistic for the RNA biosignature over the YOS 
score was estimated using logistic regression, once using the YOS as a continuous variable 
and again as a dichotomous variable (normal vs abnormal, that is, YOS ≤10 vs YOS >10).25 
Other continuous and categorical variables such as demographic, clinical and laboratory 
findings of infants with and without bacterial infections were summarized using SAS 
statistical software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
To accrue a sufficient sample size of patients with bacteremia to define the bacterial 
biosignatures, parents of 2820 febrile infants were approached from December 2008 to 
December 2010, and 1883 infants (67%; median age, 37 days, 55.7%boys) were enrolled.
Patients With Bacterial Infections
The data coordinating center randomly selected 33 infants with bacteremia and 58 with 
UTIs. One blood sample in each group did not have adequate RNA for analysis. Thus, 89 
infants with bacterial infections were included for microarray analyses (among patients with 
bacteremia, 1 also had meningitis, 15 had UTIs, and 1 had meningitis and UTI).
Patients Without Bacterial Infections
Of the 204 infants randomly selected, 190 had adequate RNA for analysis. Among the 
selected infants with proven viral infections, 94.4% (51 of 54) with enteroviral infections, 
92.3% (48 of 52) with influenza infections, and 100% (12 of 12) with other viral infections 
had adequate RNA for analysis. Among the other groups selected for analysis, 90.7% (39 of 
43) with negative results for at least 3 viruses had adequate RNA, as did 97.4% (38 of 39) 
with no viral testing performed and 50% (2 of 4) with other viral tests performed with 
negative results.

 Healthy Controls
Twenty-five healthy afebrile infants were enrolled as controls, with a median age of 78 days 
(interquartile range, 44–185 days). Of those, 76%(19 of 25) had samples with adequate RNA 
for analysis.
Figure 1 summarizes the overall study design, patient enrollment, and the allocation of 
samples obtained from the different patient groups and healthy controls for the various 
analyses performed. eTable 1 (in the Supplement) provides a complete description of the 
patients and pathogens.
The demographics and clinical and laboratory parameters of the 279 patients analyzed (89 
with and 190 without bacterial infections) are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2. Patient 
groups were comparable with regards to demographics.
Biosignatures of Infants With and Without Bacterial Infections
The first step was to define each of the specific RNA biosignatures of patients with and 
without bacterial infections compared with healthy controls. Class comparisons identified 
3753 differentially expressed RNA transcripts between 44 infants with bacterial infections 
included in the training set and 19 healthy controls (Figure 2, A). Unsupervised hierarchical 
clustering of the 3753 RNA transcripts applied to a separate test set of infants (45 with 
bacterial infections) correctly grouped 44 of 45 (97%) infants with bacterial infections 
(Figure 2, B). A similar analysis performed with the group without bacterial infections 
compared with the 19 controls identified differential expression of 2486 transcripts in the 
training set (95 without bacterial infections) (Figure 2, C). Unsupervised hierarchical 
clustering of the 2486 transcripts applied to a separate test set (95 without bacterial 
infections) correctly grouped 72 of 95 (76%) infants without bacterial infections (Figure 2, 
D).
Modular Analysis of Biosignatures of Infants With and Without Bacterial Infections
To characterize the biological differences between infants with and without bacterial 
infections, we applied a modular analytical strategy.12,18,21,23 For these analyses, modular 
maps were derived independently for the training and test sets for each of the infection 
groups and were compared with the healthy controls. This analytical method confirmed the 
reproducibility of the RNA biosignatures. As shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, the 
correlations between the training and test sets were statistically significant for both the group 
with bacterial infection biosignatures (r = 0.98; P < .001; Figure 4, A, and Figure 3, A and 
B) and the group without bacterial infection biosignatures (r = 0.99,P < .001; Figure 4, B 
and Figure 3, C and D). This analysis also demonstrated differences in expression of the 
inflammation (M4.6, M5.1, M5.7) and interferon modules (M1.2, M3.4, M5.12) between 
infants with bacterial infections (Figure 3, A and B) and without bacterial infections (Figure 
3, C and D).
Modular maps for each individual patient further illustrate the biological differences 
between the groups.13,22 The group with bacterial infections (eFigure 1A in the Supplement) 
showed marked overexpression of inflammation modules and almost no overexpression of

 interferon modules. Among infants without bacterial infections, patients with influenza and 
enterovirus infections (eFigure 1B in the Supplement) had marked overexpression of 
interferon modules and mild overexpression of inflammation modules. Patients infected with 
other viruses, those who were virus-negative, and those not tested for viruses (eFigure 1C in 
the Supplement) had mild overexpression of inflammation modules and overexpression of 
interferon modules in certain patients only.
Classifier Genes to Discriminate Febrile Infants With and Without Bacterial Infections
The KNN algorithm identified 66 classifier genes (eTable 3 in the Supplement) that best 
discriminated infants with and without bacterial infections. Leave-one-out cross-validation 
in the training set showed 82% (95% CI, 67%-92%) sensitivity and 88%(95%CI, 80%-94%) 
specificity. Validation in the test set demonstrated 87% (95% CI, 73%-95%) sensitivity and 
89% (95%CI, 81%-93%) specificity (Table 3 and Figure 5, A and B).
Because bacteremia is one of the most challenging diagnoses of the invasive infections in 
this population, we conducted a similar analysis to identify genes that best discriminated 
infants with bacteremia from those without bacterial infections. The KNN algorithm 
identified 10 classifier genes (eTable 4 in the Supplement) that best classified these 2 groups 
of patients. Leave-one-out cross-validation in the training set showed 75% (95% CI, 48%–
93%) sensitivity and 93% (95%CI, 85%–97%) specificity, while the test set demonstrated 
94%(95%CI, 70%–100%) sensitivity and 95%(95%CI, 88%–98%) specificity (Table 3 and 
Figure 5, C and D).
RNA Biosignatures vs Microbiological Cultures
Table 3 and eTable 2 (in the Supplement) demonstrate the results of the RNA biosignature 
analysis in categorizing patients with and without bacterial infections, compared with 
standard bacterial cultures. Bacterial culture-positive patients who had RNA biosignatures 
consistent with nonbacterial infections had mean white blood cell and absolute neutrophil 
counts similar to infants who had negative cultures. Furthermore, patients with negative 
bacterial cultures whose RNA biosignatures suggested bacterial infections had mean white 
blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts similar to infants with positive bacterial cultures. 
Three patients with positive blood cultures for viridans streptococci were classified a priori 
as having bacteremia; however, their profiles (using the 10 classifier genes) appeared 
different from those of patients with bacteremia caused by other pathogens (Figure 3C and 
D, arrows). In addition, the individual modular profiles of these 3 infants with suspected 
viridans streptococcus bacteremia lacked the overexpression of inflammation genes 
observed in other cases of bacteremia (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
RNA Biosignatures vs YOS Scores
The incremental diagnostic value of the RNA biosignatures compared with clinical 
observation, the YOS score, was calculated, and C statistics are summarized in eTable 5 (in 
the Supplement). The bacterial RNA biosignature was notably more predictive of bacterial 
infection than clinical examination (YOS) (C statistic, 0.89 vs 0.53) and added significantly 
to prediction beyond the YOS alone (incremental C statistic, 0.37; 95%CI, 0.30–0.43).

 Potential Clinical Utility of RNA Biosignatures
To assess the potential clinical utility of the RNA biosignatures, we calculated posttest 
positive and negative probabilities. The prevalence of serious bacterial infections in the 
parent study cohort was 9.0%, bacteremia was 2.1%, and bacterial meningitis was 0.38%, 
similar to the recent literature.26 Using the sensitivity and specificity of RNA biosignatures 
for the training and test sets (Table 3) and focusing on the most important serious bacterial 
infections (bacteremia and bacterial meningitis), the posttest negative probabilities were 
0.4% and 0%, respectively, in the training set and 0.2%and 0%, respectively, in the test set 
(eTable 6 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this preliminary study, we evaluated and demonstrated the accuracy of RNA biosignatures 
in febrile infants aged 60 days or younger at the time of their initial evaluation in the ED. We 
identified unique RNA biosignatures that discriminated between infants with and without 
bacterial infections.
Microbiologic cultures of sterile fluids remain the standard for diagnosing bacterial 
infections in young febrile infants but have limitations and require invasive procedures to 
obtain samples (urinary catheterization, lumbar puncture).27 The false-positive rate of blood 
cultures in infants may be as high as 10%, and the false-negative rate may be even 
higher.6,28,29 Microarray-based assays to measure host responses to pathogens have been 
suggested as an alternative approach to diagnosis of infectious diseases.8,9,30,31 Studies in 
older children and adults have documented the potential value of this approach for diagnosis 
of viral and bacterial infections, and tuberculosis.9–11,13–15,18,31 Despite the young age of 
the febrile infants evaluated, they carried robust RNA biosignatures and demonstrated that 
regardless of the etiology of the infections, their immune systems are programmed to 
respond not only with shared elements induced by common microbes but also with specific 
patterns that allow discrimination by class of pathogen.
Among patients with discordance between microbiological cultures and RNA biosignatures, 
traditional screening tests for bacterial infections (white blood cell count, absolute 
neutrophil count) suggested agreement with the diagnostic categorization of the RNA 
biosignatures. There were 3 infants classified as having viridans streptococcus bacteremia by 
culture (and considered to have bacteremia a priori for analysis), but whose RNA 
biosignatures, modular analyses, and screening tests suggested a lack of bacterial infection. 
There is controversy surrounding growth of viridans streptococcus from the blood of febrile 
infants and whether growth represents contaminated cultures or potential pathogens.16,32–34 
The RNA biosignatures and the traditional screening tests of these 3 infants suggest that 
growth likely represented contaminated cultures. Although this observation is limited to 3 
patients, it suggests a potential additional benefit of microarray analysis in clarifying the true 
infection status of patients that canaid in solving the conundrum of unclear culture results.
The clinical utility of the RNA biosignatures in the evaluation of febrile infants will 
ultimately be determined by their ability to exclude the diagnosis of serious bacterial 
infections rapidly and reliably. The biosignatures contributed substantially more than the

 YOS in identifying those with bacterial infections. Most importantly, the posttest negative 
probabilities for bacteremia and bacterial meningitis were very low, suggesting future 
clinical application of RNA biosignatures for excluding serious bacterial infections in febrile 
infants aged 60 days or younger.
The study has limitations. RNA biosignatures were evaluated on a convenience sample; 
therefore, the results are not necessarily generalizable to febrile infants whose guardians 
declined enrollment. However, the febrile infants analyzed were enrolled in many centers 
during a 2-year period, and the rate of serious bacterial infections observed in the parent 
cohort was similar to that described in the current literature.26 Patient diagnoses were 
adjudicated before the analysis, and bacterial cultures were considered the reference 
standard for purposes of analysis, despite a known substantial rate of false- positive and 
false-negative results. In addition, viral testing was not consistently performed for all study 
participants. Therefore, the ability to interpret the biosignatures of infants with potential 
bacterial-viral coinfections was limited; however, the ultimate goal of the study was to 
identify the RNA biosignatures of febrile infants with bacterial infections. The analysis was 
based on sampling blood just once in the course of the illness. It appears that the 
biosignatures were stable, as patients presented to the ED at variable times during their 
illnesses. The microarray analyses were performed on frozen samples batched in a central 
laboratory. It is unlikely, although possible, that the RNA biosignatures would be different if 
analyzed at the time blood cultures were obtained. However, novel polymerase chain 
reaction–based assays with rapid turnaround times should allow a practical implementation 
in the future.31 In addition, the analytic sample was relatively small; therefore, the study will 
require external validation in a larger patient population.
As technology advances, RNA biosignatures may prove to be an alternative and accurate 
method to identify infants with bacterial infections. This would help clinicians target 
evaluation and therapy when they are needed and avoid invasive procedures, antibiotics, and 
hospitalizations when they are not.
Conclusions
In this preliminary study, RNA biosignatures were defined to distinguish febrile infants aged 
60 days or younger with and without bacterial infections. Further research with larger 
populations is needed to refine and validate the estimates of test accuracy and to assess the 
clinical utility of RNA biosignatures in practice.

 Figure 2. RNA Biosignatures of Young Febrile Infants With and Without Bacterial Infections
For panels A and C, the heat map representing RNA biosignatures are identified by class 
comparisons by nonparametric test (Mann-Whitney test, P < .01), with the Benjamini-
Hochberg multiple test correction and 1.25-fold change. Transcripts are represented in rows 
and infants are represented in columns. Color bars indicate the normalized gene expression 
level (red, overexpressed; blue, underexpressed) relative to the healthy control infants 
(yellow, median gene expression of the healthy controls). The scale indicates the relative-
fold differences in gene expression levels. For panels B and D, the dendrogram branches of 
the gene tree structure are colored according to condition (blue, healthy controls; red, 
bacterial infection; green, without bacterial infection). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering 
(euclidean distance, average linkage) of the transcripts applied to a separate test set of 
infants. For these analyses, the computer algorithm groups the samples of patients and 
healthy controls according to the similarities in gene expression patterns; this is performed 
in a blinded fashion because the samples are not preassigned to the infection or control 
group.

 Figure 3. Transcriptional Modular Analysis of Young Febrile Infants With and Without 
Bacterial Infections
Modular maps were derived independently for the training and test sets. Modules (groups of 
coordinately expressed genes with similar biological function) are shown as the percentage 
of genes in that particular module that are expressed significantly differently from healthy 
controls. They are represented as dots on a grid. Module functional annotation is indicated 
by the color-code legend key. The first row on the grid includes modules that were identified 
in the first round of selection, when the modules were first described (M1; subnetwork 
constituted of genes coclustering; the letter Mis used to name the modules). Modules that 
were identified in subsequent rounds of selection make up the next rows (M2, M3, M4, M5, 
M6).22 In this display only modules from the first 6 rounds of selection are shown because 
they are considered the most biologically relevant and have better functional 
characterization.23
A and B, the average modular transcriptional profile for patients with bacterial infections vs 
healthy controls is shown.
C and D, the average modular transcriptional profile for patients without bacterial infections 
vs healthy controls.

 Figure 5. Discrimination of Febrile Infants With and Without Bacterial Infections by Classifier 
Genes
The rectangles located on the top of the heat maps represent the patient’s classification 
according to standard bacterial cultures in dark colors (red for patients with bacterial 
infections and green for patients without bacterial infections) and below according to the κ–
nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm in light colors (white represents the patients not 
classified by the KNN algorithm). The arrows located at the bottom of the heat maps 
indicate the transcriptional profiles of 3 patients (2 in panel C and 1 panel D) with positive 
blood cultures for viridans streptococcus. The profiles of these 3 patients appear visually 
different from those of most other patients with bacteremia.
A, Application of the KNN algorithm to the training set composed of febrile infants with 
and without bacterial infections identified classifier genes (listed in eTable 3 in the 
Supplement) that best discriminated the 2 groups.
B. The accuracy of the classifier genes was confirmed in an independent test set of patients 
with and without bacterial infections. The heat maps represent the expression levels of the 
classifier genes in the training and test sets. Overexpressed transcripts are shown in red and 
underexpressed transcripts in blue. Genes are ordered in the heat map from top to bottom 
according to their ability to discriminate between the groups. A similar approach was 
followed to identify classifier genes to discriminate infants with bacteremia and those 
without bacterial infections.
C, The KNN algorithm identified the classifier genes (listed in eTable 4 in the Supplement) 
in the training set composed of infants with bacteremia and those without bacterial 
infections that best discriminated the 2 groups.

Abbreviations: ANC, absolute neutrophil count; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; IQR, interquartile range; UTI, urinary tract infection; WBC, white blood cell; YOS, Yale Observation Scale.
aPatients were enrolled from December 2008-December 2010.
bTwo patients with bacteremia also had bacterial meningitis, 1 each in the training and test sets.
cSee the Methods section for the definition of the YOS score. The total YOS score ranges from 6 (a perfect score) to 30 (for the most ill-appearing infant). A YOS score of 10 or less is considered normal.
