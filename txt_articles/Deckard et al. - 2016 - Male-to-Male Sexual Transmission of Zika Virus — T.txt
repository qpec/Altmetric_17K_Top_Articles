Zika virus infection has been linked to increased risk for 
Guillain-Barré syndrome and adverse fetal outcomes, including 
congenital microcephaly. In January 2016, after notification 
from a local health care provider, an investigation by Dallas 
County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) identified 
a case of sexual transmission of Zika virus between a man 
with recent travel to an area of active Zika virus transmission 
(patient A) and his nontraveling male partner (patient B). 
At this time, there had been one prior case report of sexual 
transmission of Zika virus (1). The present case report indi-
cates Zika virus can be transmitted through anal sex, as well as 
vaginal sex. Identification and investigation of cases of sexual 
transmission of Zika virus in nonendemic areas present valuable 
opportunities to inform recommendations to prevent sexual 
transmission of Zika virus.
Epidemiologic Investigation
In January 2016, 2 days after returning to Dallas, Texas, from 
a 1-week visit to Venezuela, patient A developed subjective 
fever, pruritic rash on his upper body and face, and conjunc-
tivitis lasting 3 days. Both 1 day before and 1 day after his 
symptom onset (Day 0), patient A had condomless insertive 
anal sex with patient B. Patient A reported that during and after 
illness he experienced no symptoms of prostatitis or dysuria, 
and noted no macroscopic hematospermia.
On Day 7, patient B developed a subjective fever, myalgia, 
headache, lethargy, and malaise; a few days later, he developed 
a slightly pruritic rash on his torso and arms, small joint arthri-
tis of his hands and feet, and conjunctivitis. All symptoms 
resolved after 1 week. On Day 11, while still symptomatic, 
patient B visited his primary care provider for evaluation. 
Suspecting Zika virus infection, the provider obtained serum 
specimens from patient B on Day 11 (4 days after patient B’s 
illness onset), and from both patients A and B on Day 14 (14 
and 7 days after respective illness onsets). On Day 24, semen, 
urine, and saliva specimens were collected from both patients 
(24 and 17 days after respective illness onsets).
Patient A had traveled regularly to Central and South America 
for many years. During his recent trip to Venezuela, he reported 
that multiple persons in the area he visited were experiencing 
symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease; autochthonous 
transmission of Zika virus had been confirmed in Venezuela 
in late November 2015.* Patient B had not recently traveled 
outside of the United States and had never traveled to countries 
with active autochthonous Zika transmission. Neither patient 
had a history of prior known arboviral infection nor had they 
received yellow fever or Japanese encephalitis vaccinations. 
The men had been mutually monogamous for more than 
10 years and had no major medical illnesses or history of sexu-
ally transmitted infections. Neither patient reported ulcerative 
anal or genital lesions.
Laboratory Investigation
Samples of all clinical specimens were sent by DCHHS to 
CDC. Patient A’s serum from 14 days after illness onset and 
patient B’s serum from 4 days after illness onset contained no 
detectable Zika virus RNA using reverse transcription poly-
merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing (Table) (2). Sera from 
both patients demonstrated positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) 
responses by capture ELISA for Zika virus and dengue virus, but 
not for chikungunya virus (Table) (2). Plaque-reduction neutral-
ization tests (3) indicated that patient A had been infected with 
Zika virus, dengue virus serotype 1, or both, but that patient B 
had been infected only with Zika virus. Urine and saliva speci-
mens collected from patients A and B at 24 and 17 days after 
respective illness onsets had no detectable Zika virus by RT-PCR.

Semen specimens collected at 24 and 17 days from each 
man were tested for Zika virus by RT-PCR both by CDC and 
DCHHS using the same two sets of primers (2). At CDC, 
neither sample had detectable Zika virus with either primer 
set after 37 cycles. At DCHHS, which pretreated the thawed 
semen samples with dithiothreitol (used to induce liquefac-
tion of viscous specimens and potentially increase detection of 
RT-PCR targets), patient B’s specimen was negative. Patient A’s 
specimen had Zika virus detected at 35 cycles with one primer 
set but produced no signal after 37 cycles with the other primer 
set. Patient A’s semen results were thus deemed equivocal.
Environmental Investigation
Although Dallas is within the geographic range of the Zika 
virus mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, seasonal 
winter temperatures in the area during the week of the traveler’s 
return were not permissive for Aedes activity. Maximum area 
temperatures during the week of the traveler’s return were 
<12°C (<54°F)† and thus not suitable for overwintering Aedes 
eggs to hatch and resulting larvae to survive. BG-Sentinel 
(Biogents AG, Regensberg, Germany) and gravid mosquito 
traps placed around the residential areas of patients A and B 
in January yielded only Culex but no Aedes mosquitoes.
Discussion
In addition to the present case report, at least five other 
cases of sexually transmitted Zika virus infection supported by 
laboratory evidence have now been reported in the published 
literature; all were male-to-female transmissions involving 
vaginal sex. All of the male travelers had symptoms consistent 
with Zika virus infection and could have transmitted infec-
tions to their sex partners a few days before or after as well as 
during the time symptoms appeared (3–5). In this case report, 
patient B’s potential exposures occurred both before and just 
after initial appearance of symptoms in the traveler, which is 
the time when blood viremia appears to be highest (i.e., as 
clinical signs and symptoms of infection emerge).§
Transmission of Zika virus to patient B by Ae. aegypti or 
albopictus was unlikely based on environmental conditions. 
Even if these mosquito species had been present and active, 
the time from exposure to illness in patient B (i.e., 6–8 days) 
was shorter than the minimum estimated time required for 
Aedes to become infectious had a mosquito ingested a Zika 
virus-infected blood meal from patient A (i.e., Ae. aegypti 
extrinsic incubation period is a minimum estimated duration 
of 10 days) (6,7), and for patient B once infected to have then 
developed illness (i.e., 3–12 days).
Studies investigating seminal shedding of infection-compe-
tent Zika virus, including its incidence, pattern (e.g., intermit-
tent shedding or a steady decay), and duration are ongoing. 
At the time of Patient B’s clinical presentation, there had been 
only one published report describing testing of semen from a 
man with Zika virus infection (8); studies of semen from two 
additional men have since been reported (9,10). Zika virus 
has been detected by RT-PCR and isolated in culture from the 
semen of two men at least 2 weeks after onset of illnesses (8,10) 
and possibly up to 10 weeks after illness in one of these cases 
(8). One report described Zika virus detectable in semen by 
RT-PCR 62 days after illness onset; culture was not performed 
(9). In two men, Zika virus was no longer detectable in their 
blood by RT-PCR when the semen specimens were analyzed 
(8,9). None of the three men provided follow-up semen speci-
mens to determine when Zika virus was no longer detectable. 
Notably, all men in the five case reports and the three semen 
studies, as well as patient A, experienced symptomatic illness. 
In the report of the sexual transmission case that occurred in 
2008 (1) and of the man with culturable Zika virus in semen 
in 2013 (8), symptoms also included hematospermia.
Identifying and characterizing cases of sexually transmitted 
Zika virus infection in areas experiencing intense autoch-
thonous vector-borne Zika virus transmission is challeng-
ing. Reports of sexual transmission identified in areas where 
autochthonous transmission is not occurring offer unique 
and important opportunities to learn about this emerging 
mode of transmission and rapidly inform and refine interim 
prevention recommendations. Such cases highlight the need 
for clinicians to remain vigilant for and continue reporting 
any suspected cases of Zika virus infection to their state or

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Although Zika virus is spread primarily by Aedes species 
mosquitoes, published case reports have documented sexual 
transmission from infected men to their female sex partners 
through vaginal sex.
What is added by this report?
This is the first report of transmission of Zika virus from an 
infected man to a sex partner through anal sex.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Sexual transmission through both vaginal and anal sex is an 
emerging mode of Zika virus infection that might contribute to 
more illness than was anticipated when the outbreak was first 
recognized. Cases of sexually transmitted Zika virus infection 
should be reported to public health agencies and can help 
inform recommendations to prevent Zika virus infections.
