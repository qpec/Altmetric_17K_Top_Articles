 Daily step count and the need for hospital care
in subsequent years in a community-based
sample of older Australians
Ben D Ewald1, Christopher Oldmeadow1, John R Attia1,2
The known Most investigations of the benefits of physical
activity for health have used self-reported measures of
physical activity of limited validity. As a large proportion of
people admitted to Australian hospitals are over 55,
quantifying the factors that influence their need for hospital
care is important.
The new An increase in step count from 4500 to 8800 steps
per day was associated with 0.36 fewer hospital bed-days per
person per year.
The implications Health interventions and urban design
features that encourage walking could have a substantial
effect on the need for hospital care, and should be features of
health policy.
E
pidemiologic evidence strongly suggests that increased
levels of physical activity are associated with the reduced
incidence, prevalence and mortality of a range of dis-
eases.1 Its impact on the use of health services, however, is not
well studied. With an ageing and largely inactive population
putting increased pressure on inpatient hospital services, it is
important to understand the extent to which increased physical
activity might reduce the number of hospital admissions. The
direct health care costs for Australia of physical inactivity were
estimated to be $377 million in 2000, but this figure was based on
population-related risks for a range of diseases, rather than
assessment of the actual use of services.2
Data on hospital admissions for particular diseases are available;
for example, for patients in Denmark with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease the risk of hospital admission over the subse-
quent 12 years was 28% lower for those who reported any physical
activity than for patients who reported no activity.3 In another
study, the risk of hospital admission for women with venous
thrombo-embolism was 24% lower in those walking more than 5
hours a week than for those who walked less than one hour per
week.4
Health care costs have also been studied; for example, in a
large community-based sample of Canadians over 65 years of
age, the self-reported health care costs for people who met
physical activity guidelines were CAN$1214 (60%) lower over
the following 12 months than for those who were inactive.5
Similar results were found in Japan, with 12-month health
care costs £174 (13%) lower for those walking one hour a day
than for people who did not.6 Contrasting findings were made
in the younger National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) sample in the United States (average age,
45
years),
for
whom
there
was
no
association
between
self-reported physical activity and total health expenditure in
the following year.5,7
Only one previous study has investigated associations between
objectively measured physical activity and subsequent health
service use. A United Kingdom cohort of 240 people (average age,
78 years) wore accelerometers for a week and was followed for an
average of almost 5 years. The incidence of unplanned hospital-
isation was 2.13 times higher in those with low levels than in people
with higher daily levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity
(mean, 3 v 39 minutes), and 1.81 times higher in those with low
daily step counts than in people with high counts (mean, 2100 v
7100 steps). There was also an inverse association with the number
of prescriptions written, but not for the number of general practice
consultations or referrals to specialist care.8 The question of reverse
causation was not investigated: the possibility that, rather than
physical activity improving health, illness causes people to be less
active.
Research
into
population-wide
physical
activity
has
been
hampered by the low validity of self-reported measures, so that
more recent published research has favoured objective measure-
ment with pedometers, accelerometers, and metabolic methods.
We enrolled people over the age of 55 years in a cohort study
during 2004e2007, collecting a wide range of data on baseline
Abstract
Objectives: To determine the extent to which physical activity
reduces the number of hospital bed-days for Australians over 55,
using an objective measure of activity.
Design, setting and participants: 9784 Newcastle residents
aged 55 years or more were invited to participate. 3253
responders were eligible and wore pedometers for one week
during 2005e2007; their hospital data from recruitment to
31 March 2015 were analysed (mean follow-up time: 8.2 years).
Complete data for 2110 people were available for analysis.
Main outcome measures: Mean annual hospital bed-days,
according to individual step count.
Results: There was a statistically significant reduction in the
number of hospital bed-days associated with higher step counts;
the incidence rate ratio per extra 1000 steps per day at baseline
was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.90e0.94). The disease-specific reductions
were significant for admissions for cancer and diabetes, but not
for cardiovascular disease. The difference between 4500 and
8800 steps per day (the upper and lower quartile boundaries for
step count) was 0.36 bed-days per person per year, after
adjusting for age, sex, number of medications, number of
comorbidities, smoking and alcohol status, and education. When
analysis was restricted to hospital admissions after the first
2 years of follow-up, the difference was 0.29 bed-days per
person per year.
Conclusions: More active people require less hospital care, and
an achievable extra 4300 steps per day would result in an
average of one less day in hospital for each 3 years of life.

 variables, including step counts. This was the first cohort of more
than 1000 people for whom data on an objective measure of
physical activity at baseline were collected, giving us a unique
opportunity to examine the effect of baseline step counts on hos-
pital use in subsequent years.
Methods
The Hunter Community Study includes a cohort of community-
dwelling men and women aged 55e85 years who reside in New-
castle, New South Wales. Participants were randomly selected
from the NSW state electoral roll and contacted between December
2004 and December 2007. Listing on the electoral roll is compulsory
in Australia, and it is estimated to be 93.6% complete.9 A modified
Dillman recruiting strategy10 was applied. Two letters of intro-
duction and an invitation to participate were posted to the selected
candidates; individuals who did not respond to the initial letters
were telephoned by a research assistant if a publicly listed number
was available. If contact was not established after five attempts, the
individual was classified as anon-responder. People who could not
speak English or were living in residential aged care facilities were
excluded.
After providing consent, participants were asked to complete two
questionnaires and to return them when they attended a data
collection clinic, at which a series of clinical assessments was
undertaken. Consent from participants was also sought at this time
to link personal information obtained during the study with
Medicare data (Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme)
and local hospital databases. A package of three further ques-
tionnaires, to be returned by reply-paid post, was given to partic-
ipants to complete at home after their clinical assessment.
Administering the questionnaires in segments before and after the
clinical phase aimed to reduce the burden for respondents and to
thereby maximise attendance for clinical assessments.
Step count was recorded over a week by a pedometer (Yamax)
worn during waking hours, and participants recorded the daily
step count in a diary. In 2004e2007, there was little community
awareness of step count targets, and no guidance was given as to
how many steps constituted a healthy amount of activity. The
pedometer was worn on the waist belt, in line with either leg. Days
with less than 9 hours’ wear were excluded from analysis, and a
daily average count was calculated for participants with at least
3 days of wear.
Hospital admissions for the 2623 people who consented to record
linkage were retrieved from both public and private hospitals. All
hospital admissions in NSW are coded by professional hospital
coders using the International Classification of Diseases, version 10
(ICD-10), with a first position code for the principal reason for
admission and up to ten other codes for comorbidities. We chose
bed-days rather than admissions as the outcome measure because
it more accurately reflects health care costs, and physical activity
could conceivably influence the severity as well as the incidence of
disease.
Statistical methods
Baseline demographic information for the analysis population (all
those with complete pedometry, hospital admissions and relevant
clinical and demographic data) was summarised as means and
standard deviations for continuous variables and as frequencies
and percentages for categorical variables. The distributions of these
variables were compared with the NSW 2006 census population
aged 55e85 years (where available) in c2 tests.
For each consenting participant, we estimated the number of hos-
pital bed-days from enrolment in the study to 31 March 2015, based
on data in the admitted patient database. The number of days in
hospital was defined according to the admission and discharge
dates, initially for all admissions, and then stratified by ICD-10 and
procedural codes, allowing us to determine cancer-, diabetes- and
cardiovascular
disease
(CVD)-specific
hospital
separations.
Private hospital follow-up time was excluded for CVD-related
admissions because data were missing for some years.
We initially analysed the total number of bed-days after recruit-
ment, and then performed a sensitivity analysis that excluded data
for the first 2 years of follow-up, in order to examine the effect of
reverse causality.
To determine the appropriate set of confounding variables for
estimating the effect of physical activity on the number of hospital
admissions, we constructed a directed acyclic graph (online
Appendix). The following variables were deemed sufficient: age at
the baseline survey, sex, number of medications, number of
comorbidities (angina, asthma, heart attack, osteo-arthritis, rheu-
matoid arthritis, stroke, diabetes, elevated cholesterol levels,
thyroid conditions, depression or anxiety, atrial fibrillation, bron-
chitis or emphysema, cancer), smoking status (never, former or
current smoker), level of alcohol consumption (never drink, safe,
moderate, hazardous/binge, hazardous/chronic, unknown), and
most advanced level of education.
A negative binomial regression model was used, with number of
hospital bed-days as the outcome, log length of follow-up as an
offset, and step counts, education level, sex, number of comor-
bidities, number of medications, smoking status, and alcohol
consumption included as independent variables. In the models for
disease-specific bed-days, the number of participants with no
bed-days was high, so a zero-inflated negative binomial model was
employed for these analyses. Incidence rate ratios are presented
with Wald 95% confidence intervals [CIs], P values, and least
squares mean estimates for number of bed-days at the lower
quartile, median, and upper quartile boundaries for step counts.
Goodness of fit was assessed by visually inspecting estimates of
observed and model-predicted bed-days, and plots of deviance
residuals v independent variables. All analyses were conducted in
Stata 13.1 (StataCorp).
Ethics approval
Ethics approval was granted by the University of Newcastle
Human Research Ethics Committee (reference, H-820-0504a).
Results
Invitation letters were sent to 9784 individuals randomly selected
from the electoral roll. Of the 7575 subjects who responded, either
in person or through a relative, 258 were ineligible (148 did not
speak English, 92 had subsequently died, 18 had moved to an aged
care institution); 3440 refused and 3877 agreed to participate.
A total of 3253 people actually participated, giving a response rate
of 44.5% of eligible responders. The participant group reflected the
Australian population aged 55e85 years in terms of sex and marital
status, but was slightly younger. Further details of recruitment and
the representativeness of the sample have been published
elsewhere.11
Valid step count data were recorded for 2458 participants, of whom
2174 had consented to record linkage. The baseline number of
medications was not well reported (20% missing data), so this
variable was omitted from further analyses. We present a complete

 case analysis of the data for the 2110 participants for whom com-
plete data on all variables of interest were available (Box 1).
Compared with the NSW population aged 55e85 years in 2006,
the proportion of participants who did not drink alcohol was
similar; more had a university or trade qualification, fewer were
smokers, and there was a statistically significant different age
distribution.
The total number of person-years followed up was 17 374
(excluding the first 2 years, 13 514 person-years), with a mean of
8.2 years (range, 7.0e11.1 years). The median daily step count was
6.6k steps (k ¼ 1000; interquartile range, [IQR], 4.5ke8.8k steps);
1% of participants had step counts greater than 16.4k, and the
maximum value was 23.9k. The median overall time in hospital
was 2 days (IQR, 0e9 days); 1% of participants spent more than
135 days in hospital, and the maximum stay was 384 days.
Excluding the first 2 years of follow-up, the median time in
hospital was 0 days (IQR, 0e5 days; maximum, 294 days). The
number of bed-days of hospital care associated with particular
diseases is shown in Box 2.
Association between step count and number
of bed-days
The average number of bed-days per year for people at the 25th
percentile step count was 1.12, for those at the 75th percentile it was
0.76, a difference of 0.36 bed-days, or 32%. After excluding the first
2 years’ follow-up, the average number of bed-days per year for
people at the 25th percentile step count was 0.97, while for those at
the 75th percentile it was 0.68, a 30% reduction (Box 3).
After adjusting for potential confounders, the overall estimated
number of bed-days per year of follow-up decreased by 9% for each
1000-step increase in daily step count (95% CI, e10% to e6%;
P < 0.001). A higher step count was found to be associated with
fewer bed-days for cancer and diabetes, but not for CVD (Box 3).
Estimated bed-days for step counts in the range 1ke10k are shown
in Box 4.
A sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the effect of
outliers. Models were re-run after exclusion of the top 1% of values
for bed-days and step counts. The results were essentially similar,
but the benefit for patients with cancer was no longer statistically
significant (data not shown).
Discussion
We report the first investigation of the association between objec-
tively measured physical activity and hospital use over an
extended follow-up period. People taking 8800 steps per day (the
75th percentile boundary) spent almost one-third of a day less in
hospital per year of follow-up than people taking 4500 steps per
day (the 25th percentile boundary). The estimated difference was
slightly smaller (0.29 days) when the first 2 years of follow-up were
excluded, and we regard this smaller figure as the best estimate
of the causal effect. This difference equates to a 30% lower

 requirement for hospital care being associated with 4300 extra
steps per day, or about 40 minutes of walking.
While the effect of step count on cancer and diabetes admissions
data was significant, we were surprised to find no significant effect
on CVD admissions; this anomaly may be related to the fact that
data for CVD admissions in the private sector were missing.
The strengths of our study included the large community-based
sample,
our
adjustment
for
appropriate
confounders,
the
extended follow-up, and complete ascertainment of hospital ad-
missions from NSW hospital records. The response rate with
respect to recruitment was only 22%, but the sample was never-
theless reasonably representative of the NSW population. Potential
weaknesses included the possibility of residual reverse causality,
even after removing the first 2 years’ follow-up and adjusting for
the number of diagnoses at baseline. Our analysis assumes that the
week of step counts recorded at baseline was typical for the par-
ticipant’s usual activity. There is also an inherent limitation in the
use of step counters to record overall physical activity, as they do
not capture, for instance, swimming or cycling, nor do they record
the intensity of activity. They do, however, capture all movement
throughout the day, and we have previously shown that step
counts have greater validity than a self-reported physical activity
scale.12
The cost of a day in hospital in Australia in 2012e13 was $1895,13 so
$550 can potentially be saved annually for each person who
increases their physical activity by an achievable 4300 steps per
day. These steps can be accumulated as many brief activities
throughout the day, or as steady walking for about 3 kilometres.
Previous investigation of the doseeresponse curves for various
health indicators in older people has shown that the steepest part
of the curve is at the lower end of activity.14 Moving from 3000 to

Health implications
Our estimates of the hospital care burden associated with varying
levels of physical activity suggest that large reductions in hospital
use may be possible with measures that increase community
physical activity levels, such as health coaching, restricting parking
availability, and better urban design.
