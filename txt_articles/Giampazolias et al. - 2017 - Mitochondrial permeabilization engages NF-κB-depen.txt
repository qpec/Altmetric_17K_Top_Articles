 Abstract
Apoptosis represents a key anti-cancer therapeutic effector mechanism. During apoptosis, 
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation (MOMP) typically kills cells even in the absence 
of caspase activity. Caspase activity can also have a variety of unwanted consequences that include 
DNA-damage. We therefore investigated whether MOMP-induced caspase-independent cell death 
(CICD) might be a better way to kill cancer cells. We find that cells undergoing CICD display 
potent pro-inflammatory effects relative to apoptosis. Underlying this, MOMP was found to 
stimulate NF-κB activity through the down-regulation of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins. 
Strikingly, engagement of CICD displays potent anti-tumorigenic effects, often promoting 
complete tumour regression in a manner dependent on intact immunity. Our data demonstrate that 
by activating NF-κB, MOMP can exert additional signalling functions besides triggering cell 
death. Moreover, they support a rationale for engaging caspase-independent cell death in cell-
killing anti-cancer therapies.
Introduction
Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation or MOMP, is often essential for apoptosis; 
MOMP enables the release of mitochondrial proteins, including cytochrome c, that activate 
caspases leading to rapid cell death 1. Nevertheless, cells typically die following MOMP 
even in the absence of caspase activity, through a process called caspase-independent cell 
death (CICD). This defines MOMP as a point-of-no-return that commits a cell to die 2.
Apoptosis is broadly considered a positive process that can serve to both prevent and treat 
cancer 3. However, various data argue that apoptosis may also have detrimental effects that 
are potentially tumour promoting 4, 5. For instance, sub-lethal apoptotic stress can engage 
caspase activity in the absence of cell death, leading to DNA damage and genomic 
instability 6–8. We have previously found that these effects were dependent upon MOMP in 
a limited cohort of mitochondria, permitting sub-lethal caspase activity 6.
Caspases are not required for MOMP-induced killing; this finding, coupled to the negative 
effects of engaging sub-lethal caspase activity, led us to ask whether CICD might be a better 
way to kill cancer cells. We find that under caspase-deficient conditions, MOMP can trigger 
TNF-dependent necroptosis as a form of CICD. Underlying this, MOMP triggers NF-κB 
activation during CICD, leading to pro-inflammatory and immunogenic effects. Most 
importantly, therapeutic engagement of CICD displays significantly enhanced anti-tumour 
activity relative to apoptosis.
Results
Mitochondrial permeabilisation can engage necroptosis as a form of caspase-independent 
cell death
Mitochondria are not required to execute necroptosis; however whether they can initiate this 
type of cell death is unclear 9. We investigated whether mitochondrial permeabilisation 
could trigger necroptosis as a type of caspase-independent cell death (CICD). To induce 
apoptosis, SVEC cells were treated with the BH3-mimetic ABT-737 +/- the pan-caspase

 inhibitor Q-VD-OPh. Caspase activity was determined by Western blotting for PARP1 
cleavage and cell viability was measured by propidium iodide (PI) exclusion. ABT-737 
treatment led to PARP1 cleavage that was blocked by Q-VD-OPh treatment (Figure 1A). 
ABT-737 triggered cell death irrespective of caspase-inhibition (Figure 1B) but in a MOMP-
dependent manner, since MCL-1 expression (which is not effectively inhibited by ABT-737) 
prevented cell death (Figure 1C, Supplemental Figures 1A, 1B, 1C) 10. To investigate 
whether necroptosis could contribute to CICD, we inhibited RIPK1 and RIPK3 – two 
kinases often essential for necroptosis 11. SVEC cells were treated with ABT-737 +/- Q-
VD-OPh together with necrostatin-1 (nec-1), to inhibit RIPK1, or following RIPK3 shRNA-
knockdown (Supplemental Figure 1D). RIPK3 knockdown prevented necroptosis induced by 
TNF/zVAD treatment, confirming functional inhibition (Figure 1D). Neither nec-1 treatment 
nor RIPK3 knockdown had any effect upon ABT-737 mediated apoptosis (Figure 1E). 
Nevertheless, inhibition of RIPK1 or RIPK3 reduced CICD following BH3-mimetic 
treatment, demonstrating that necroptosis can be engaged following mitochondrial 
permeabilisation (Figure 1E). We investigated this further using BCL-xL dependent SVEC 
cells generated using our mito-priming method 3. SVEC cells expressing GFP-tBID 2A 
BCL-xL (BCL-xL dependent SVEC cells) were treated with ABT-737 +/- Q-VD-OPh. 
Alternatively, we used BCL-xL dependent SVEC cells in which mitochondrial-dependent 
caspase activity was inhibited by APAF-1 shRNA knockdown 3. Cell viability was measured 
using SYTOX Green exclusion and Incucyte cell imaging. Verifying their BCL-xL survival 
dependency, ABT-737 treatment led to rapid cell death (Figure 1F) and with expected slower 
kinetics, in the presence of Q-VD-OPh or following APAF-1 knockdown (Figure 1F). Q-
VD-OPh treatment completely prevented PARP1, caspase-3, -7 and BID cleavage 
confirming effective caspase inhibition (Figure 1G and Supplemental Figure 1E). Using 
these cells we investigated whether necroptosis could contribute to CICD. BCL-xL 
dependent SVEC cells were treated with ABT-737 together with Q-VD-OPh and necroptosis 
was inhibited by nec-1 treatment, RIPK3 knockdown or by CRISPR/Cas-9 mediated 
deletion of the essential necroptosis executioner protein MLKL (Figures 1H, 1I and 1J, 
Supplemental Figures 1F - H). In all cases, cell death was reduced following ABT-737/Q-
VD-OPh treatment. Therefore, mitochondrial permeabilisation can engage necroptosis as a 
form of caspase-independent cell death.
MOMP induces TNF synthesis under caspase-deficient conditions
We reasoned that MOMP might trigger necroptosis directly by activating RIPK1/RIPK3 or, 
indirectly, via TNF signalling. To discriminate these possibilities, SVEC cells were treated 
to undergo CICD in the presence of nec-1 (to inhibit RIPK1) or Enbrel (TNF-receptor-
II/IgG fusion protein) to inhibit TNF signalling. Cell viability was measured by PI exclusion 
(Figure 2A). As before, ABT-737/Q-VD-OPh induced CICD in a nec-1 sensitive manner. 
Neither Enbrel nor nec-1 treatment impacted on ABT-737 mediated apoptosis (Figure 2A). 
However, inhibition of TNF signalling by Enbrel treatment reduced cell-death following 
ABT-737/Q-VD-OPh treatment that was not further inhibited by nec-1 treatment (Figure 
2A). Similar results were obtained using BCL-xL-dependent-SVEC cells (Figure 2B). This 
demonstrates that MOMP-induced necroptosis requires TNF. In a reciprocal manner, 
exogenous TNF massively enhanced CICD following ABT-737 treatment that was inhibited 
by either RIPK3 knockdown or nec-1 treatment (Figure 2C). Therefore, under caspase-

 inhibited conditions, MOMP can engage and sensitise to TNF-dependent necroptosis. We 
asked whether MOMP could trigger TNF synthesis. BCL-xL dependent SVEC cells were 
treated with ABT-737 +/- Q-VD-OPh and analysed by qRT-PCR for Tnf mRNA transcript 
level (Figure 2D). Under caspase-inhibited conditions, ABT-737 treatment led to an increase 
in Tnf transcript level (Figure 2D) in a MOMP-dependent manner (Figure 2E, Supplemental 
Figure 1I). Using an ELISA, we also confirmed an increase in extracellular TNF protein 
level following engagement of CICD (Figure 2F). To extend these findings, we used cells in 
which mitochondrial-dependent caspase activity was inhibited by APAF-1 knockdown 3 or 
by CRISPR/Cas-9 deletion of caspase-9 (Supplemental Figure 1J). In both settings, 
ABT-737 treatment led to an increase in TNF transcript levels (Figures 2G, 2H). The 
MOMP-dependent increase of Tnf transcript was necroptosis independent since it was not 
impacted by MLKL deletion (Supplemental Figure 1K). Finally, we assayed Tnf transcript 
levels in BCL-xL-dependent-MEFs following ABT-737 treatment in the presence of Q-VD-
OPh. Similar to SVEC cells, Tnf mRNA was also increased in MEFs following ABT-737 
treatment, dependent on caspase inhibition (Figure 2I).
Mitochondrial permeabilisation activates NF-κB
Given a major role of TNF in inflammation, we aimed to understand how MOMP could 
drive inflammatory signals in caspase-deficient settings, hypothesising that MOMP might 
activate NF-κB - a key pro-inflammatory transcriptional regulator. BCL-xL dependent 
SVEC cells were treated with ABT-737 and NF-κB activation was measured by NF-κB p65 
nuclear translocation. Importantly, ABT-737 treatment led to NF-κB activation in a manner 
that was significantly increased under caspase-deficient conditions (Figures 3A and 3B). 
BAX/BAK deleted SVEC cells failed to activate NF-κB following ABT-737 treatment, 
demonstrating its MOMP dependence (Figures 3C, 3D, Supplemental Figure 2A). Inhibiting 
mitochondrial-dependent caspase activity by APAF-1 shRNA-knockdown or by caspase-9 
CRISPR/Cas9 deletion also enabled NF-κB activation following ABT-737 treatment 
(Supplemental Figures 2B, 2C). Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of IKKβ or 
NEMO (also called IKKγ) inhibited NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation following 
ABT-737/Q-VD-OPh treatment (Supplemental Figures 2D, 2E). Consistent with an ability 
of MOMP to activate NF-κB, IκBα phosphorylation and degradation was detected 
following ABT-737 treatment in caspase-deficient settings. Loss of IκBα, but not 
phosphorylation was also observed in cells treated with ABT-737 to undergo apoptosis, in 
line with IκBα being a reported caspase substrate (Figure 3E)12. Using luciferase-based 
reporter constructs, ABT-737 treatment was also found to increase NF-κB transcriptional 
activity under caspase-inhibited conditions (Figure 3F). Combined ABT-737/Q-VD-OPh 
treatment also led to NF-κB activation in MEF and HeLa cells (Supplemental Figure 2F). 
Importantly, neither Enbrel treatment nor MLKL-deletion affected ABT-737/Q-VD-OPh 
induced NF-κB p65 translocation, demonstrating that MOMP-induced NF-κB activation is 
TNF and necroptosis independent (Supplemental Figures 2G and 2H). To investigate 
whether Tnf mRNA up-regulation following MOMP required NF-κB we expressed IκBSR 
(super repressor) - a non-degradable IκBα that inhibits NF-κB nuclear translocation 13. 
Inhibition of NF-κB activity by IκBSR expression was verified by inhibition of NF-κB p65 
nuclear translocation following MOMP and increased cell death following TNF treatment 
(Figure 3G, Supplemental Figures 2I, 2J). Importantly, IκBSR expression completely

 prevented Tnf mRNA up-regulation following ABT-737 treatment, confirming its NF-κB 
dependence (Figure 3H). IκBSR expression also inhibited cell death following ABT-737/Q-
VD-OPh treatment, consistent with a role for MOMP-dependent TNF synthesis in 
necroptosis engagement (Supplemental Figure 2K). These data demonstrate that under 
caspase-deficient conditions, MOMP potently activates NF-κB leading to the expression of 
pro-inflammatory TNF.
MOMP activates NF-κB through IAP down-regulation and NIK activation
We next sought to understand how mitochondrial permeabilisation could trigger NF-κB 
activity. Small molecules called SMAC-mimetics can activate NF-κB by causing IAP 
protein degradation leading to NIK stabilisation and activation 14, 15. Because these 
molecules mimic the mitochondrial protein SMAC (also called DIABLO), which is released 
from mitochondria following MOMP – we hypothesised that MOMP might activate NF-κB 
through a similar mechanism (Supplemental Figure 3A). BCL-xL dependent SVEC cells 
were treated with ABT-737 together with Q-VD-OPh or with SMAC-mimetic (SM-83), and 
cell lysates were probed for c-IAP1, NIK and XIAP (Figure 4A). Supporting previous data, 
SMAC-mimetic (SM-83) treatment led to cIAP1 down-regulation and a concomitant 
increase of NIK (Figure 4A) 14, 15. Phenocopying this effect, combined ABT-737/Q-VD-
OPh treatment also triggered cIAP1 loss, NIK up-regulation and, additionally, XIAP 
depletion. cIAP1 and XIAP loss was partially inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, 
indicating that they were targeted for proteasomal degradation following MOMP 
(Supplemental Figure 3B). Similar effects were observed in MEF and HeLa cells following 
ABT-737 treatment (Supplemental Figure 3C). Demonstrating a MOMP dependency, 
combined ABT-737/Q-VD-OPh treatment triggered a loss of cIAP1, XIAP and an increase 
in NIK that was completely blocked in BAX/BAK deleted cells (Figure 4B). These data 
demonstrate that MOMP can signal IAP-protein degradation and NIK up-regulation. We 
investigated whether this was required for MOMP-dependent NF-κB activity by generating 
NIK-deleted or cIAP2 overexpressing SVEC cells (Supplemental Figure 3D). Cells were 
treated with ABT-737 in the presence of caspase inhibitor and NF-κB activity was assayed 
by measuring nuclear translocation of NFκB p65 (Figure 4C, Supplemental Figures 3E and 
3F). Following NIK deletion or cIAP2 over expression, NF-κB activation was strongly 
suppressed in response to ABT-737/Q-VD-OPh treatment (Figure 4C, Supplemental Figures 
3E and 3F). ABT-737/Q-VD-OPh-dependent Tnf mRNA up-regulation was also inhibited in 
NIK deleted or cIAP2 overexpressing cells (Figure 4D). Finally, ectopic cIAP2 expression 
inhibited up-regulation of NIK following ABT-737/Q-VD-OPh treatment (Figure 4E). NF-
κB transcriptional activity typically occurs following activation of either the canonical or the 
non-canonical (alternative) pathway. Our results support canonical NF-κB activation 
following MOMP, however given the well-established association between NIK with non-
canonical NF-κB activity, we investigated non-canonical NF-κB activity following MOMP. 
Consistent with non-canonical pathway activation following MOMP, increased NF-κB p100 
to p52 processing was observed following ABT-737/QVD treatment (Supplemental Figure 
3G). Nevertheless, inhibiting non-canonical NF-κB activity (by deleting p100 or RelB) did 
not block canonical NF-κB activation following MOMP (Supplemental Figures 3H - J). 
These data support a model that MOMP signals NF-κB activation in a manner analogous to 
SMAC-mimetics. We therefore investigated the dependence of these effects on endogenous

 SMAC and OMI (a mitochondrial protein that also binds IAP proteins upon MOMP). 
E1A/Ras transformed wild-type MEF or SMAC-/- OMI-/- MEFs were treated with a 
combination of ABT-737 and UMI-77 (MCL-1 inhibitor) to engage MOMP and cIAP1 
levels were measured (Figure 4F) 16, 17. cIAP1 was depleted to a similar extent in both cell 
lines, demonstrating that cIAP1 degradation neither requires SMAC or OMI. Similarly, 
combined knockdown of SMAC and OMI did not rescue cIAP1 or XIAP loss following 
ABT-737/Q-VD-OPh treatment (Supplemental Figure 3K). Accordingly, wild-type MEF and 
SMAC-/- OMI-/- MEF activated NF-κB to a similar extent following MOMP (Figure 4G). 
Besides SMAC and OMI, other mitochondrial proteins can bind IAP proteins 18, 19. 
Because these could potentially mediate IAP degradation we investigated whether MOMP 
could trigger IAP degradation by a SMAC-like mechanism. XIAP or an XIAP point-mutant 
(XIAP D214S E314S) unable to bind SMAC were expressed in BCL-2 dependent HeLa cells, 
and cells were treated to undergo MOMP (Figure 4H) 20. While XIAP was rapidly degraded 
following ABT-263/Q-VD-OPh treatment, the XIAP mutant unable to bind SMAC was 
completely stabilised. This supports a model whereby IAP proteins are degraded by a 
SMAC-like mechanism following MOMP leading to NIK and NF-κB activation.
Mitochondrial permeabilisation activates an NF-κB dependent pro-inflammatory response
We investigated whether mitochondrial permeabilisation could induce additional pro-
inflammatory cytokines besides TNF. BCL-xL dependent SVEC cells were treated with 
ABT-737 +/- Q-VD-OPh and culture supernatant was assayed for cytokine levels (Figure 
5A, Supplemental Figure 4A). Several cytokines tested including MCP-1, KC, IL-6, TNF 
and IL-12, were up-regulated following ABT-737 treatment dependent on caspase-inhibition 
(Figure 5A, Supplemental Figure 4A). To investigate the NF-κB dependence of this pro-
inflammatory signature SVEC cells expressing IκBSR were treated with ABT-737 together 
with Q-VD-OPh. NF-κB inhibition silenced most cytokines analysed following ABT-737/Q-
VD-OPh treatment (Figure 5B, Supplemental Figure 4B). Similarly, qRT-PCR analysis also 
revealed NF-κB dependent transcriptional up-regulation of various cytokines following 
ABT-737/Q-VD-OPh treatment (Figure 5C). Pro-inflammatory cytokine up-regulation 
following MOMP was not inhibited in MLKL-deleted cells, demonstrating its necroptosis 
independence (Supplemental Figure 4C). Canonical NF-κB activity alone was required for 
MOMP-induced cytokine up-regulation (Supplemental Figures 4D - H). Importantly, 
mitochondrial permeabilisation has recently been found to trigger a type I interferon 
response dependent upon mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) activating the cGAS/STING 
signalling pathway 21, 22. We therefore asked whether MOMP-induced NF-κB activity also 
contributed to the interferon response. SVEC cells expressing IκBSR were treated with 
ABT-737 together with Q-VD-OPh and an interferon response gene signature was assayed 
by qRT-PCR (Figure 5D). As controls, STING signalling was inhibited by CRISPR/Cas-9 
STING deletion or by using mtDNA-depleted ρ0 SVEC cells (Supplemental Figure 4I and 
4J). Consistent with the findings of others, inhibition of cGAS/STING signalling effectively 
blocked the interferon transcriptional response following MOMP (Supplemental Figure 4K 
and 4L) 21, 22. Significantly, suppressing NF-κB activity by IκBSR expression, also 
inhibited the interferon transcriptional response (Figure 5D). Given this, we investigated the 
relationship between MOMP-induced NF-κB and STING activities. NF-κB activity was 
measured by monitoring NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation following ABT-737/Q-VD-OPh

 treatment in STING deleted or ρ0 SVEC cells (Figure 5E). MOMP induced NF-κB activity 
was unaffected in STING deleted and ρ0 cells, demonstrating that MOMP induced NF-κB 
activity neither requires mtDNA nor STING. In agreement, cIAP1 was still degraded 
following MOMP in both ρ0 and STING-deleted SVEC cells following ABT-737/Q-VD-
OPh treatment (Figure 5F). Finally, we investigated whether MOMP dependent NF-κB 
transcriptional targets also required STING signalling. STING-deleted SVEC cells were 
treated with ABT-737 together with Q-VD-OPh and cytokine transcript levels were 
measured by qRT-PCR (Figure 5G). Interestingly, while some NF-κB dependent 
transcriptional targets were affected by STING-deletion (Mcp-1, Tnf) others (Kc, Gm-csf) 
were not (Figure 5G), highlighting a differential requirement for STING-activity following 
MOMP.
MOMP dependent NF-κB signalling within dying cells promotes macrophage activation
We next investigated whether engaging mitochondrial apoptosis versus CICD could elicit 
different paracrine effects. BCL-xL dependent SVEC cells were incubated with ABT-737 +/- 
Q-VD-OPh and culture supernatant was transferred to primary bone marrow derived 
macrophages (BMDMs). Macrophage activation towards an M1, pro-inflammatory or an 
M2, anti-inflammatory state was assayed by qRT-PCR for transcripts characteristic of either 
state (Figure 6A). Importantly, media from cells undergoing CICD promoted macrophage 
activation towards an M1-phenotype, as determined by an increase in M1-associated 
transcript levels, whereas no effect was observed using media from apoptotic cells (Figure 
6A). Consistent with this, BMDMs incubated with media from cells undergoing CICD also 
displayed an increase in the M1-associated marker, CD86 (Figure 6B). Media transferred 
from SVEC cells undergoing CICD following APAF-1 knockdown or caspase-9 deletion 
also activated macrophages towards an M1-phenotype (Figure 6C, Supplemental Figures 5A 
and 5B). These effects required MOMP but not necroptosis, since media transferred from 
ABT-737/Q-VD-OPh treated BAX/BAK deleted cells failed to activate macrophages 
whereas media from MLKL deleted cells still activated macrophages (Figure 6D, 
Supplemental Figures 5C and 5D). Significantly, NF-κB inhibition (through IκBSR 
expression) completely prevented the ability of cells undergoing CICD to promote M1-
polarisation (Figure 6E). Inhibiting MOMP-dependent NF-κB activation by deletion of NIK, 
NF-κB p65, NEMO or by cIAP2 overexpression also had inhibitory effects (Supplemental 
Figures 5E - 5H). These results demonstrate that the ability of CICD to promote M1-
macrophage polarisation requires MOMP dependent NF-κB activity. Because M1-
macrophages are associated with anti-tumourigenic properties 23 we asked if tumour cells 
undergoing CICD could also activate macrophages towards an M1-profile. Primary tumour 
cells were isolated from a Myc-driven mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC) and treated with ABT-737 together with Q-VD-OPh. Consistent with MOMP-
dependent transcriptional up-regulation, TNF and IFNβ transcript levels increased following 
treatment (Supplemental Figure 5I). Culture supernatant was transferred to primary BMDMs 
and macrophage activation state was determined by qRT-PCR and flow-cytometry (Figures 
6F and 6G). Under CICD conditions, media from PDAC cells also promoted polarisation of 
macrophages towards an M1-state (Figures 6F and 6G). We investigated what factor(s) 
produced by cells undergoing CICD could promote macrophage activation, focusing initially 
on TNF. SVEC cells were treated to undergo CICD and media was transferred to wild-type

 macrophages +/- Enbrel or to BMDMs derived from TNFR-1-/- mice and macrophage 
activation was assessed (Supplemental Figures 5J and 5K). In both cases, TNF signalling 
inhibition abrogated but did not abolish macrophage activation. Given this, coupled to our 
finding and that of others 21, 22 that cells undergoing CICD produce IFNβ led us to carry 
out similar experiments in the presence of neutralising IFNβ antibody. IFNβ neutralisation 
either alone or in combination with Enbrel (to block TNF) also inhibited macrophage 
activation (Supplemental Figure 5L) to some extent, demonstrating that TNF and IFNβ 
contribute to CICD-induced macrophage activation. These data show that apoptosis and 
CICD can exert differential paracrine effects. Importantly, cells undergoing CICD can 
promote macrophage inflammatory activation towards a potentially anti-tumourigenic 
phenotype that requires MOMP-driven NF-κB activity.
Caspase-independent cell death displays potent anti-tumourigenic effects
Our findings suggest that under caspase-deficient conditions, MOMP-dependent NF-κB 
activity could confer therapeutic benefit in cancer treatment. To test this, we performed 
tumour allograft and treatment experiments using the colorectal cancer line CT26. These 
cells are RIPK3 deficient, allowing investigation of anti-tumourigenic CICD effects in the 
absence of necroptosis 24. CT26 cells were transduced with GFP-tBID 2A BCL-2 encoding 
retrovirus to generate a heterogeneous population of BH3-mimetic sensitive and resistant 
cells. These were either caspase-proficient or rendered deficient in MOMP-induced caspase 
activity through APAF-1 knockdown (Supplemental Figure 6A). BH3-mimetic treatment 
induced a similar extent of MOMP in the presence or absence of APAF-1 (Supplemental 
Figure 6A). Cells were subcutaneously injected into BALB/c mice as syngeneic hosts. 
Following tumourigenesis, mice were treated with the BH3-mimetic ABT-263 (the orally 
available bioequivalent of ABT-737) to induce either tumour-cell apoptosis or CICD 
(Supplemental Figure 6B). Caspase activity was only detectable under apoptotic conditions, 
as confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for active caspase-3 (Supplemental Figure 
6C). Supporting our in vitro data, Luminex assay revealed increased systemic cytokine 
levels; the majority of them pro-inflammatory, under conditions where tumour-specific 
CICD had been engaged (Figure 7A, Supplemental Figure 6D). We next investigated 
immune cell infiltration into tumours after CICD induction or apoptosis. While total 
macrophage infiltration was similar following either CICD or apoptosis (Supplemental 
Figure 6E), areas of macrophage accumulation were prevalent in tumours permissive only 
for CICD (Supplemental Figure 6F). Importantly, highly granulated macrophages expressed 
significant levels of MHC-II but not CD206, where CICD had specifically been triggered, 
mirroring the in vitro pro-inflammatory status observed previously (Supplemental Figures 
6G, 6H). An increase in T-cell infiltration was specifically observed following engagement 
of tumour cell CICD (Figures 7B, 7C). Together with our previous results, these data argue 
that CICD may be more immunogenic than apoptosis. Based on this, we directly addressed a 
possible therapeutic benefit of engaging tumour-specific CICD compared with apoptosis. 
BCL-2-dependent control or APAF-1 knockdown CT26 were subcutaneously injected into 
BALB/c mice. Once tumours were established, mice were treated four times with ABT-263 
over a two-week period and tumour growth was monitored (Figure 7D). In the presence of 
vehicle alone, APAF-1 knockdown tumours grew slower than their wild-type counterparts. 
Tumour growth was unaffected by ABT-263 engagement of apoptosis, however under CICD

 conditions, ABT-263 treatment led to a significant overall reduction in tumour growth 
(Figure 7D). Further analysis revealed complete regression in 50% of mice bearing APAF-1 
knockdown tumours, following ABT-263 treatment (Figure 7E). These data show that 
engaging CICD in tumours elicits inflammatory and immune effects. Most importantly, 
CICD displays potent anti-tumour effects, frequently leading to complete tumour regression.
CICD anti-tumourigenic effects requires NF-κB and intact immunity
Because engaging tumour CICD can lead to complete tumour regression, we investigated the 
role of immunity in mediating these effects. Similar to before, BCL-2-dependent control or 
APAF-1 knockdown CT26 were subcutaneously injected into BALB/c mice. Following 
tumour establishment, mice were treated four times with ABT-263 over a two-week period. 
Tumours were isolated at a defined endpoint, then analysed by flow-cytometry for tumour 
infiltrating immune cells. Tumours displaying regression or outgrowth, were termed as 
responders or non-responders respectively. Consistent with earlier results, APAF-1 
knockdown tumours displayed the most effective response following ABT-263 treatment 
(Supplemental Figure 7A). Importantly, ABT-263 treatment led to an increase in total 
macrophage infiltration (F4/80+) as well as an enhancement of activated, anti-tumourigenic 
macrophage subsets (NOS2+, CD86+, MHC-II+) in tumours responding to CICD 
(APAF-1SH)(Figure 8A and Supplemental Figure 7B). Analysis of tumour infiltrating T-
cells, revealed an increase in total T-cell infiltrate, comprised of increased CD4+ T-helper 
cells and cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells specifically in tumours responding to CICD (APAF-1SH)
(Supplemental Figure 7C). Furthermore, an increase in IFNγ+ CD4+ T-helper cells, 
consistent with activation an anti-tumourigenic Th1 response, and activated cytotoxic CD8+ 
cells (IFNγ+, GZMB+, IFNγ+/GZMB+) was identified in tumours responding to CICD 
(Figures 8B and 8C). These results demonstrate that an anti-tumourigenic immune activation 
correlates with response following CICD engagement. We therefore hypothesized that the 
beneficial effects of engaging CICD might be due to an ability of the immune system to 
control tumour growth. To test this, BCL-2-dependent control or APAF-1 knockdown CT26 
cells were subcutaneously injected into immunocompromised NOD scid gamma c-/- (NSG) 
mice. Following tumour establishment, mice were left untreated or repeatedly treated with 
ABT-263 and tumour growth was monitored (Figure 8D and Supplemental Figure 7D). 
Importantly, ABT-263 treatment had no effect on tumour growth in NSG mice thereby 
supporting a key role for the immune system in mediating the anti-tumorigenic effects of 
CICD. APAF-1 knockdown tumours grew with similar kinetics to wild-type tumours in NSG 
mice (Supplemental Figure 7D), unlike their slower growth in immuncompetent BALB/c 
mice (Figure 7D). This may be due to a basal level of CICD activating, growth-inhibitory 
anti-tumour immunity. We carried out similar experiments under T-cell depleted conditions. 
BCL-2-dependent APAF-1 knockdown CT26 were subcutaneously injected into BALB/c 
mice. Once tumours were established, mice were treated with ABT-263 and T-cell depleting 
antibody (anti-Thy.1) or isotype control over a two-week period and tumour growth was 
monitored. Anti-Thy.1 treatment effectively depleted T-cells (Supplemental Figures 7E and 
7F) and robustly inhibited the anti-cancer effects of engaging CICD, completely prevented 
tumour regression (Figure 8E and Supplemental Figure 7G). We addressed whether the anti-
cancer effects of engaging CICD were dependent upon MOMP-induced NFκB activation.

 CT26 were subcutaneously injected into BALB/c mice (Supplemental Figure 7H). 
Following tumour formation, mice were treated with the BH3-mimetic ABT-263 to induce 
tumour-cell CICD and tumour growth monitored (Figure 8F). Importantly, while ABT-263 
CICD engagement promoted complete tumour regression, blocking NF-κB signalling 
through NEMO-knockdown, inhibited these effects (Figure 8F, Supplemental Figure 7I). 
Finally, we examined the potential clinical relevance of our findings by interrogating the 
Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA) 25. We investigated the relationship between NF-κB, 
caspase activity and treatment outcome in renal cell carcinoma. Phospho-NF-κB p65 S536 
and cleaved-caspase 7 were used as measures of NFκB and caspase activity (Figure 8G). In 
line with our data, an inverse correlation between NF-κB activity and caspase-7 activity was 
found (Figure 8G). Importantly, high levels of NF-κB activity and low levels of caspase-7 
activity also correlated with improved prognosis following therapy (Figure 8G). These data 
show that CICD is an immunogenic form of cell death, and that both NF-κB activity during 
CICD and immunity are required for its anti-tumourigenic effects.
Discussion
As others have reported 26, progressive mitochondrial dysfunction that ensues post-MOMP 
under caspase-inhibited conditions, leads to cell death. Nevertheless, our data demonstrates 
that how MOMP kills - either by apoptosis or CICD - has profoundly different effects. 
Unlike mitochondrial apoptosis, cells undergoing CICD display a pro-inflammatory 
phenotype dependent on NF-κB activity in the dying cell. Importantly, recent studies have 
shown that MOMP can also activate cGAS/STING signalling dependent on mtDNA 21, 22. 
While we find that MOMP-dependent NF-κB activation and cGAS/STING signalling are 
independent events, both are required for the collective pro-inflammatory effects of CICD.
How does MOMP activate NF-κB? From our data we propose a model that MOMP activates 
NF-κB in a manner similar to small-molecule SMAC-mimetics. NF-κB is typically anti-
apoptotic27, moreover IKK activity can also promote survival through NF-κB-independent 
means28. Nevertheless, because widespread MOMP represents a terminal event, NF-κB or 
IKK activation post- MOMP won’t allow long-term cell survival. Our results demonstrate 
that NIK-dependent canonical NF-κB activity is important for the inflammatory and anti-
tumour effects we observe. While NIK is best associated with activation of non-canonical 
NF-κB activity it has also been shown to crosstalk with canonical NF-κB activity 29–31. 
Indeed, SMAC-mimetics also activate canonical NF-κB signalling in a manner that can 
depend on NIK 14, 15, 32. The failure of NIK-deletion to completely prevent NF-κB 
signalling following MOMP suggests additional MOMP-dependent pathways may also 
signal NFκB activity.
Importantly, triggering CICD but not apoptosis often led to complete tumour regression. 
Especially under conditions of partial therapeutic response, as our experiments mimic, these 
data suggest that triggering tumour-specific CICD rather than apoptosis may be a more 
effective way to treat cancer. Indeed others have also observed enhanced anti-tumourigenic 
effects treated with cytotoxic agents together with caspase inhibitor 33, 34. Why might 
CICD be more anti-tumourigenic than apoptosis? From our data, we reason that CICD is 
more immunogenic than apoptosis and that this contributes to its increased anti-tumour

 activity. Mirroring our findings, NF-κB activity has recently been shown to be a key 
immunogenic determinant of necroptotic cell death that is essential for anti-tumour 
immunity 35. While necroptosis is not important for the anti-tumour effects of CICD, NF-
κB activation is. Because many cancers are resistant to necroptosis36, this significantly 
broadens the potential utility of targeting CICD in cancer. Importantly, caspase activity is 
neither required for MOMP-dependent cell death and indeed can have unwanted effects 4. 
Coupled to our own findings, we propose that engaging CICD as a means of anti-cancer 
therapy warrants further investigation.

in this study were found in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines that is 
maintained by ICLAC.
Retroviral and lentiviral transduction
Phoenix Eco (for retroviral transduction of mouse cell lines) and Phoenix Ampho (for 
human cells) were transfected with 5 μg of selected plasmids, using Lipofectamine 2000 
(Invitrogen). After two days, the viral supernatant was filtered and used to infect cells, in the 
presence of 1 μg/mL polybrene. After two rounds of infection antibiotic treatment was 
applied as follows: 200 ug/mL Zeocin (Invitrogen) for LZRS vectors and 8 ug/mL of 
blasticidin for PMX vectors. For CT26 cell transductions, 293T cells were used for virus 
production: the indicated plasmids were co-transfected and the packaging plasmids pVSVG 
(Addgene 12260) and HIV (gag-pol). For lentiviral transduction, 293T cells were co-
transfected with selected plasmids and 2 μg of pVSVG (Addgene 12260) and 3.72 μg of 
psPAX2 (Addgene 8454) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Viral infection and 
subsequent selection was performed as above. For positive clone selection blasticidin (8 
μg/mL) or puromycin (10μg/mL) was used. CRISPR/Cas9 KO cells were generated by 
lentiviral transduction as described above and positive clones were selected with puromycin 
(1μg/mL).
Generation of ρ0 cells
SVEC cells were cultured in the presence of ethidium bromide (EtBr, 500 ng / mL) for a 
week to generate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depleted cells (ρ0 cells). Total DNA was 
extracted and qPCR was performed. The mitochondrial content was measured by the ratio of 
mtDNA (Dloop) vs genomic DNA (Tert) as measured by qPCR. Primers: Dloop_FW:

Bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) isolation
Macrophages were generated from bone marrow precursors as described previously 40. 
Briefly, bone marrow stem cells were isolated from mice by flushing the bone marrow with 
PBS. Bone marrow stem cells were differentiated into macrophages by culturing them for 6 
days in RPMI medium containing M-CSF (10 ng/mL). Media (containing M-CSF) was 
replaced after 3 days. Where indicated, BMDM’s were isolated from wild-type and Tnfr1−/− 
mice as previously described 41.

Microscopy
Cells were fixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 10 minutes and then permeabilised with 0.2% 
Triton/PBS for 10 minutes followed by 1 hour incubation at room temperature with blocking 
buffer (2% BSA/PBS). Cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with the following antibodies: 
NFκB-p65 (sc-372, Santa Cruz, 1/300 dilution in blocking buffer), NFκB-p65 (8242P, Cell 
Signalling, 1/400 dilution in blocking buffer) and cytochrome c (556432, BD Biosciences,

staining. Cells undergoing MOMP were scored by the diffusion or loss of cytochrome c 
staining. Cells undergo MOMP were scored as positive with nuclear p65 translocation by 
co-staining with DAPI. As a positive control of p65 nuclear translocation TNF treatment was 
used. Data represents the mean of the total number of fields obtained from three independent 
experiments. Images were taken using a Nikon A1R confocal microscope and analyzed with 
Image J 1.47i. List of antibodies used is also provided in Supplemental Table 6.

 Cell viability assays
Cell viability was determined either by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences, San 
Jose, CA) or IncuCyte FLR imaging system (Essen Bioscience, Ann Arbor, MI), using the 
non-cell-permeable nuclear staining procedures: 10 μg/mL Propidium Iodide (PI, P3566, 
Invitrogen - flow-cytometry) or 30nM SYTOX Green (SG, S7020, Invitrogen - Incucyte), 
respectively, according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The number of SYTOX Green 
positive cells was normalized to the confluency factor and the percentage of SYTOX Green-
positive cells was calculated against a control that achieved 100% cell death. FACS Gating 
strategy for PI staining is outlined in Supplemental Figure 8.

discriminate live/dead cell populations. FACS Gating strategy is outlined in Supplemental 
Figure 8. List of antibodies used is provided in Supplemental Table 6.
T-cell activation
Freshly isolated tumours were digested with collagenase (1.5 mg/ml) for 30 minutes in 37°C 
and subsequently homogenised. 2 x 106 isolated cells were treated with 50 ng/ml PMA, 1 
µg/ml ionomycin and 1X Brefeldin A in complete RPMI medium and incubated for 6 hours 
in corning 96-well plate. Cells were collected, stained with Zombie Yellow cell death dye

ELISA and Luminex assay
Conditioned media was concentrated using the Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Unit with 
Ultracel-3 membrane (UFC800324, 3 kDa cut-off, Milipore), according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol. TNF protein concentration was measured using the Murine TNF 
Mini ELISA Development Kit (900-M54, Peprotech), according to the manufacturer's 
protocol. For the Luminex assay a mouse Cytokine Magnetic 20-Plex Panel (LMC0006M, 
Invitrogen) was used to measure cytokine levels in mouse serum, and tissue culture 
supernatant (condensed with the Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Unit), according to the 
provided protocol.
Luciferase assay
SVEC cells (2 x 106 cells in 10cm plate) were transfected with 2 μg of empty vector (PGL3) 
or NF-κB reporters (reporter 1: PGL3-TNF - TNF promoter binding sites, reporter 2: PGL3-
NP3 - NF-κB binding sites). Luciferase activity was measured by Glomax / Veritas 
Microplate Luminometer, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (luciferase assay kit 
E1500, Promega). Each obtained value was normalized to μg of protein of each individual 
sample and empty vector.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
IHC was performed on 10% buffer-formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (4 μm thick). 
Staining was performed using a Dako autostainer. Anti-caspase-3, ASP-175 (9661, Cell 
Signalling) was used at 1/50 dilution after antigen retrieval with PT buffer (pH 6.0). Anti-
CD3 (VP-RM01, Vector Labs) was used at 1/60 dilution after antigen retrieval with PT 
buffer (pH 6.0). Anti-F4/80 (ab6640, AbCam) was used at 1/400 dilution after antigen 
retrieval with Proteinase K for 10 minutes.
In silico analysis
Protein correlation analysis as well as survival curves of clinical samples (Kidney renal cell 
carcinoma), have been generated by using the TCPA (The Cancer Proteome Atlas) 
bioinformatic-platform provided by MD Anderson Cancer Centre 43.
In vivo experiments
Experiments with Balb/C mice were done in accordance with UK regulations under project 
license PPL 70/8645, ethical review (University of Glasgow) and the EU Directive 2010. To 
observe the effect of Apaf1 on tumour growth in vivo, 0.5 × 106 CT26 GFP tBID 2A BCL-2 
(proficient) and CT26 GFP tBID 2 BCL-2 APAF-1SH (deficient) cells were suspended in 
200 µl PBS and were subcutaneously implanted into the flank of 6 week old Balb/C female 
mice (Charles River, UK). Once tumour volumes reached approximate 100 mm3 (length × 
width2/2), mice were ranked and randomly divided into four groups. Mice were orally dosed 
four times over a two-week period with 100 µl Vehicle (10% ethanol, 30% PEG glycol 400, 
and 60% Phosal 50 PG) or ABT-263 (100mg/kg, diluted in vehicle). Tumours were

 measured by caliper thrice weekly and mice were killed humanely when tumours reached 
clinical endpoint of predetermined size or ulceration. Furthermore, mice that were orally 
dosed two times over a one-week period of time were humanely killed and tumours were 
assessed for immune cell infiltration either by FACS or by IHC.
For NOD scid gamma c-/- (NSG) experiments, 6 week old NSG mice were subcutaneously 
injected with 0.5 × 106 APAF1 KD CT26 cells expressing GFP-tBID 2A Bcl2 cells 
resuspended in 200 μl of PBS. Once tumor volume reached approximately 100 mm3 (length 
x width2/2), mice were given 100 μl of Vehicle (10% Ethanol, 30% PEG glicol 400, and 
60% Phosal 50 PG) or ABT-263 (diluted in vehicle) orally four times over a one week 
period. The animals were then inspected three times a week for tumor development. Once 
tumors started to develop they were measured every day using a caliper. Mice were 
humanely killed when tumors reached a predetermined size.
In vivo T-cell depletion
As described previously, CT26 cells expressing eGFP-tBID 2A BCL-2 together with 
pLKO1-shAPAF-1 (APAF-1SH) were injected subcutaneously into 6 weeks old Balb/C mice 
(5x105 cells/mouse). Once tumor volume reached approximately 100 mm3 Following 
tumour formation, mice were initially treated with 400 μg of isotype control or anti-Thy.1 
(I.P injection) and then were continued to be treated with 200 μg twice per week. Efficiency 
of T cell depletion was checked by flow cytometric analysis of spleen samples. FACS Gating 
strategy is outlined in Supplemental Figure 8. List of antibodies used is provided in 
Supplemental Table 6.
Statistics and Reproducibility
For the in vitro experiments, normal distribution was assumed, whereas for the in vivo 
experiments normal distribution has been tested prior the use of the appropriate statistical 
test. Two-tailed unpaired t-test was used for comparison of two groups, whereas the one-, 
two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and non-parametric one-way ANOVA (Kruskal-
Wallis) was used for comparison of multiple groups. Spearman’s rank test was used for 
correlation analysis. Cox and Log-Rank p-value were used for survival curve (Kaplan 
Meier) analyses. Finally, two-tailed Chi-Square was used to determine any significant 
differences in frequencies of complete tumour regression between two groups. Analyses 
were performed using Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad).
