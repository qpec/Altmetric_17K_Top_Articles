Abstract
Malaria transmission is influenced by climate, land use and deliberate intervention. Recent 
declines have been observed in malaria transmission. Here, we show that the continent has 
witnessed a long-term recession in the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum since 1900-29 (40%) 
to 2010-15 (24%), interrupted at different times by periods of rapidly increasing and decreasing 
transmission. The cycles and trend over the last 115 years are inconsistent with simplistic 
explanations in terms of climate or intervention alone. Previous global initiatives had minor 
impacts on malaria transmission, and a historically unprecedented decline has been observed since 
2000. However, there has been little change to the continued high transmission belt covering large 
parts of West and Central Africa. Previous efforts to model the changing patterns of P. falciparum 
transmission intensity in Africa have been limited to the last 15 years1,2, or have used maps of 
historical expert opinion3. We provide quantitative data comprising 50,424 surveys at 36,966 
geocoded locations to cover 115 years of malaria history in sub-Saharan Africa.

 Short term seasonal cycles are a fundamental aspect of the epidemiology of malaria. Longer-
term climate anomalies, changing environmental and intervention landscapes also alter the 
likelihoods of mosquito-human contact or the duration of host infection. The supra-seasonal, 
long-term cycles of transmission are poorly defined for P. falciparum malaria in Africa.
To provide an empirical basis to define the long-term nature of malaria transmission cycles, 
we used data on the P. falciparum parasite rate, the proportion of persons positive for malaria 
infection among those examined. These data were assembled as part of an intensive search 
lasting 21 years (SI 1). The data represent the largest ever assembled repository of any 
parasitic disease in Africa and provide information on over 50,000 community-based 
surveys across SSA since 19004 (SI 1; Extended Data 1; Extended Data 2), the data are 
released with this publication. We have used the space-time cube of data to leverage power 
from neighbouring areas and preceding data points in time5, within a conditional 
autoregressive spatial and temporal model to compute a smoothed median estimate for 
approximately five-year intervals since 1900 across 520 sub-national administrative 
polygons (Extended Data 3) within the changing limits of P. falciparum transmission (Figure 
1).
The median posterior predictions of P. falciparum prevalence provide a summary of several 
important cycles in the history of malaria transmission across the continent (Figure 2). The 
impact of interventions and/or climate can only be assessed by temporal plausibility rather 
than quantitative analysis. Between 1900 and 1944, efforts to control malaria focused on 
areas of European economic influence, largely targeting vector larvae or mass quinine 
administration campaigns targeting the parasite6, and we did not observe declines in 
transmission.
We observed two precipitous declines in infection prevalence in 1945-49 and in 2005-2009. 
Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and chloroquine were introduced in 1945-1949, and 
the widespread introduction of insecticide treated bed nets (ITN) and artemisinin-based 
combination therapy (ACT) in 2005-2009 (Figure 2). Indoor residual house-spraying (IRS) 
with DDT was introduced through comparatively small projects during the 1950s and 
expanded in the 1960s only in southern Africa, Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia and Madagascar. 
Expansion to national scales of ITN took over a decade following successful trial projects to 
reach moderate levels of coverage in Africa before 20107.
Both precipitous declines in malaria prevalence followed rises in prevalence. The rise in 
median malaria prevalence during the period 1985-2004 led to a return to the prevalence 
witnessed fifty years earlier, before the introduction of DDT (Figure 2). This period also 
included: a) a rapid expansion of chloroquine resistance across Africa9; b) climate 
anomalies on the continent with changes in sea surface temperatures in the pacific10 (Figure 
2); and c) failure of many national health agencies to prioritize the growing malaria 
epidemic because of lack of international donor assistance12.
The period 1960 to 1984 was characterised by a slow decline in malaria prevalence across 
Africa (Figure 2). Remarkably, this coincided with a cessation of malaria elimination 
ambitions across much of SSA13, emerging resistance to organochloride insecticides14 and 
Snow et al.

 a period where malaria was integrated into broader health agendas, focussed on the 
presumptive treatment of fevers with choroquine (cheap, widely available and efficacious). 
This period also included drought across much of the Sahel10 (Figure 2) rendering some 
areas unsuitable for malaria transmission15. Hence several interventions may have 
influenced the observed trends, but no single factor appears sufficient.
Despite impressive gains in the coverage of effective interventions since 2005, the rate of 
malaria prevalence reduction has slowed during the interval 2010-2015 (Figure 2). 
Continued challenges to malaria control include difficulties in ensuring access to ACTs and 
the threat of drug resistance, rapidly emerging insecticide resistance, and inadequate funding 
planning to replace long-lasting insecticide treated nets16.
There has been an overall recession in malaria transmission intensity over the last 115 years. 
Independent abiotic factors related to economic growth may have contributed to this overall 
recession, but the constant growth in GDP17, urbanization18 or female education17, cannot 
explain the emerging malaria epidemic 1985-2004. Conversely, minimum temperatures 
across SSA have risen by over 1°C since the 1970s10 (Figure 2), and the linear phenomena 
of global warming cannot explain the precipitous declines in malaria prevalence witnessed 
after 2004. The interplay between malaria, climate, effective or failing intervention, human 
settlement and development is inevitably complex. Our analysis highlights that a focus on 
one factor alone is too simplistic and fails to adequately explain the cycles of parasite 
prevalence.
The reduction in malaria transmission intensity has not occurred equally between countries 
or within countries (Figure 1), with more substantive declines and “shrinking of the map” at 
the margins of the historical range of P. falciparum transmission compared to the heartland 
of Africa’s most efficient vector species Anopheles gambiae s.s and An. colluzi, that forms a 
densely populated belt from West Africa, through central Africa down toward Mozambique. 
This remains the most significant part of the malaria endemic world today, was ignored after 
196019,20 and risks being ignored today21. Our previous, and current, armoury of 
interventions did not, and will not, eliminate malaria in this part of the world.
Caution is required in predicting a complex future, but if the future is consistent with the 
past we would predict further reductions in the range of and intensity of malaria 
transmission in Africa but punctuated with resurgences. We show the implausibility of 
simplistic explanations for temporal trends over the last 115 years, and therefore caution 
against simplistic explanations for the trend of the last 15 years (e.g. ascribing the trend to 
human intervention alone). The unique endemicity that prevails in Africa cannot be ignored 
in any global effort to eliminate P. falciparum, nor should we wait for a future storm to re-
galvanize interest in a parasite that remains entrenched in across large parts of the continent.
Methods
Data Assembly
Over 21 years we sourced unpublished and published materials related to community-based 
malaria infection prevalence at European, United Nations and African national libraries, 
Snow et al.

 archives and ministry of health repositories. We undertook standard electronic data searches 
of peer-reviewed publications, and contacted malaria scientists, regional health research 
institutes, government and non-government agencies involved in the delivery and monitoring 
of malaria interventions (SI 1.3 and SI 1.4). The minimum data requirements for the survey 
included the date and location, age range, numbers examined, infection prevalence by 
species and parasite detection method. A total of 50,424 parasite prevalence surveys since 
1900 were included4 (SI 1.5; Extended Data 1; Extended Data 2).
Spatial limits and resolution of malaria predictions
We excluded previously endemic north African countries (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya 
and Egypt), off-shore islands and countries where malaria has not been described (Western 
Sahara and Lesotho). We used current national and sub-national first-level administrative 
boundary units used by the UNs GAUL project22, with adaptations for the margins of 
natural P. falciparum risk, disputed boundaries, dissolving small urban municipalities and to 
ensure contiguous shapes between sub-national units. Rwanda, Burundi, Djibouti, Swaziland 
and The Gambia were treated as single polygons (SI 2.1; SI 2.2; Source Data Figure 1). The 
natural spatial limits of P. falciparum risk were derived from expert opinion national maps 
and biological constraints (SI 2.2; Source Data Figure 1). The selection of 520 spatial 
polygons at the natural range of P. falciparum transmission is shown in Extended Data 3. 
Changing limits were mapped using data from national reports of malaria incidence since 
the 1960s (SI 2.3; Source Data Figure 1).
Statistical methods
We employed a Bayesian hierarchical binomial model that simultaneously estimates stable 
spatial and temporal structured patterns and departures from these stable components5. The 
input data were as follows: observed number of P. falciparum positive children aged 2-10 
years, PfPR it , and total number of tested children aged 2-10 ,n it, for subnational region i = 
1, … , 520 , and period t = 1, … , 16 (1900-1929, 1930-1944, and five year periods from 
1945-1949 to 2010-2015). The model was fitted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
simulation using non-informative priors. Posterior distributions of parameters were obtained 
using WinBUGS software (SI 3; Source Data Figure 1). Gelman-Rubin statistics was used to 
assess model convergence (Extended Data 4). Observed versus fitted PfPR2-10 from the full 
model was used to validate output (Extended Data 5).
