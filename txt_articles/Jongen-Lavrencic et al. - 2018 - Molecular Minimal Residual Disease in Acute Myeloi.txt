BACKGROUND
Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) often reach complete remission, but 
relapse rates remain high. Next-generation sequencing enables the detection of mo-
lecular minimal residual disease in virtually every patient, but its clinical value for 
the prediction of relapse has yet to be established.
METHODS
We conducted a study involving patients 18 to 65 years of age who had newly di-
agnosed AML. Targeted next-generation sequencing was carried out at diagnosis and 
after induction therapy (during complete remission). End points were 4-year rates of 
relapse, relapse-free survival, and overall survival.
RESULTS
At least one mutation was detected in 430 out of 482 patients (89.2%). Mutations per-
sisted in 51.4% of those patients during complete remission and were present at vari-
ous allele frequencies (range, 0.02 to 47%). The detection of persistent DTA mutations 
(i.e., mutations in DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1), which are often present in persons 
with age-related clonal hematopoiesis, was not correlated with an increased relapse 
rate. After the exclusion of persistent DTA mutations, the detection of molecular 
minimal residual disease was associated with a significantly higher relapse rate than 
no detection (55.4% vs. 31.9%; hazard ratio, 2.14; P<0.001), as well as with lower rates 
of relapse-free survival (36.6% vs. 58.1%; hazard ratio for relapse or death, 1.92; 
P<0.001) and overall survival (41.9% vs. 66.1%; hazard ratio for death, 2.06; P<0.001). 
Multivariate analysis confirmed that the persistence of non-DTA mutations during 
complete remission conferred significant independent prognostic value with respect to 
the rates of relapse (hazard ratio, 1.89; P<0.001), relapse-free survival (hazard ratio for 
relapse or death, 1.64; P 
= 
0.001), and overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 1.64; 
P 
= 
0.003). A comparison of sequencing with flow cytometry for the detection of re-
sidual disease showed that sequencing had significant additive prognostic value.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with AML, the detection of molecular minimal residual disease during 
complete remission had significant independent prognostic value with respect to re-
lapse and survival rates, but the detection of persistent mutations that are associated 
with clonal hematopoiesis did not have such prognostic value within a 4-year time 
frame. (Funded by the Queen Wilhelmina Fund Foundation of the Dutch Cancer

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
A 
cute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a 
heterogeneous group of clonal hemato-
poietic stem-cell disorders with a variable 
response to therapy.1-3 Although the majority of 
patients with newly diagnosed AML have morpho-
logic complete remission after they are treated 
with intensive induction chemotherapy, relapse 
rates remain high.2 Decisions about the choice 
of postremission therapy in patients with AML 
currently depend on the identification of a selected 
set of genetic markers at diagnosis and the detec-
tion of residual disease with multiparameter flow 
cytometry.2,4 Quantitative molecular evaluation 
during complete remission could further improve 
prognostication of outcomes in patients with AML.
The potential of the detection of molecular 
minimal residual disease after treatment to pre-
dict disease relapse in patients with AML has 
been explored, but assessment of molecular min-
imal residual disease is not widely established in 
clinical practice. Previous studies have dealt with 
only a few leukemia-specific genetic aberrations.5-11 
Next-generation sequencing enables comprehen-
sive, simultaneous detection of somatic mutations 
that are often patient-specific, both at diagnosis 
and during treatment.5,12 Initial studies showed 
the complex dynamics of residual mutations after 
induction therapy and the possible association 
between the persistence of certain somatic mu-
tations and risk of relapse.12,13
In determining whether molecular monitor-
ing may be applicable in patients with AML, the 
phenomenon of age-related clonal hematopoie-
sis (also known as clonal hematopoiesis of inde-
terminate potential),14-17 a condition characterized 
by the recurrence of gene mutations (allele fre-
quency, >2%) in healthy persons with no evidence 
of hematologic disease, has added an extra layer 
of complexity. Persons with age-related clonal 
hematopoiesis have a slightly increased risk of 
developing hematologic cancers over time.14,15,18 
Mutations in the epigenetic regulators DNMT3A, 
TET2, and ASXL1 (i.e., DTA mutations) are most 
common in persons with age-related clonal he-
matopoiesis.14-19 Residual leukemia-specific mu-
tations that are present in the bone marrow 
during complete remission may represent either 
residual leukemic cells or age-related clonal he-
matopoiesis.14,15,17 Whether posttreatment persis-
tence of genetic mutations associated with age-
related clonal hematopoiesis in the bone marrow 
from patients with AML has an effect on the 
disease course remains unclear.
We evaluated a large cohort of patients with 
AML to investigate whether targeted molecular 
monitoring with next-generation sequencing could 
add clinical value for predicting the recurrence of 
leukemia.
Methods
Study Design
The study was designed by the first two and the 
last two authors, who wrote the manuscript with 
input from the other authors. The authors vouch 
for the completeness and accuracy of the data and 
analysis. No one who is not an author contributed 
to the manuscript. There was no commercial sup-
port for the study.
Patients and Cell Samples
Between 2001 and 2013, we obtained samples of 
bone marrow or peripheral blood from 482 pa-
tients, between the ages of 18 and 65, who had 
a confirmed diagnosis of previously untreated 
AML (428 patients) or had refractory anemia with 
excess of blasts, with a score on the Revised 
International Prognostic Scoring System of more 
than 4.5, indicating a high or very high risk of 
relapse (54 patients). To be included in the study, 
patients had to be in either complete remission 
or complete remission with incomplete hemato-
logic recovery (defined according to the European 
Leukemia Net recommendation; hereafter collec-
tively referred to as complete remission), with less 
than 5% blast cells in the bone marrow,2,4 after 
receiving two cycles of induction chemotherapy 
(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). 
Among patients in whom at least one mutation 
was detected at diagnosis, samples were obtained 
during a defined period of remission, between 
21 days and 4 months after the start of the sec-
ond treatment cycle.
Patients were treated according to the clini-
cal protocol of either the Dutch–Belgian Coop-
erative Trial Group for Hematology–Oncology 
(HOVON)20 or the Swiss Group for Clinical 
Cancer Research (SAKK). The treatment proto-
cols and patient eligibility criteria have been de-
scribed previously.21,22 All the patients provided 
written informed consent. Details about the

Supplementary Appendix.
Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing  
and Multiparameter Flow Cytometry
To detect the mutations in 54 genes that are often 
present in patients with hematologic cancers, we 
used targeted next-generation sequencing with 
the Illumina TruSight Myeloid Sequencing Panel 
(Illumina), following the manufacturer’s proto-
col. Detection of residual disease with multipa-
rameter flow cytometry was performed as de-
scribed previously.23 Details about these detection 
methods and data interpretation are provided in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
The 430 patients in whom at least one mutation 
was detected at diagnosis were randomly assigned 
to either a training cohort (283 patients) or a 
validation cohort (147 patients); the two cohorts 
had similar clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular 
characteristics (Table 1, and Fig. S1 and Table S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The primary 
end point was the 4-year cumulative incidence of 
relapse (defined according to the European Leu-
kemia Net recommendation4), and the secondary 
end points were the 4-year rates of overall sur-
vival and relapse-free survival. Within each co-
hort, the difference in the incidence of relapse 
between patients in whom residual disease was 
detected and those in whom residual disease 
was not detected was evaluated with the use of 
the method of Gray and the Fine and Gray model 
for competing risks. The log-rank test and the 
Cox proportional-hazards model were used for 
survival analyses. A two-sided P value of 0.05 or 
less was considered to indicate statistical signifi-
cance. Details about the statistical analyses are 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
Results
Detection of Mutations at Diagnosis
We performed targeted next-generation sequenc-
ing to detect gene mutations at diagnosis in sam-
ples obtained from 482 patients with AML (Fig. 
S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). We detected 
an average of 2.9 mutations per patient; at least 
1 single mutation, which could potentially serve 
as a marker of residual disease, was present in 430

(89.2%) of the patients. Mutations in NPM1, 
DNMT3A, FLT3, and NRAS were among the most 
common detectable mutations at diagnosis (Ta-
ble 1 and Fig. 1A, and Table S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Detection of Mutations during Complete 
Remission
We then performed targeted next-generation se-
quencing to detect persistent mutations after in-
duction therapy in samples of bone marrow ob-
tained from 430 patients who were in complete 
remission. Persistent mutations were detected in 
51.4% of the patients (Fig. 1A, and Fig. S2A in 
the Supplementary Appendix). The rate at which 
mutations persisted was highly variable across 
genes. DTA mutations were most common, per-
sisting at rates of 78.7% for DNMT3A, 54.2% for 
TET2, and 51.6% for ASXL1 (Fig. 1A). In contrast, 
the majority of mutations in genes related to the 
RAS pathway were cleared after induction thera-
py, with mutations in NRAS, PTPN11, KIT, and 
KRAS persisting at rates of 4.2%, 7.0%, 13.5%, 
and 12.5%, respectively.
Of note, the allele frequencies of the muta-
tions that persisted during complete remission 
ranged from 0.02 to 47% (Fig. 1B). This finding 
suggests that residual mutation-bearing cells 
could constitute a minor population of the cells 
or perhaps even a majority of the cells. An allele 
frequency of 50% is consistent with the presence 
of a heterozygous mutation in all cells. Thus, 
although the patients were in morphologic com-
plete remission, which would typically imply that 
heterozygous mutations are present at allele 
frequencies lower than 2.5% (the equivalent of 
<5% blast cells in the bone marrow), the sam-
ples that were obtained during remission often 
contained mutations with much higher allele 
frequencies (Fig. 1B).
Mutations that persisted after induction ther-
apy at allele frequencies higher than 2.5% were 
often DTA mutations (Fig. 1, and Fig. S2 and S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix). In contrast, 
mutations in IDH1, IDH2, STAG2, TP53, and other 
genes only occasionally persisted after induction 
therapy at allele frequencies higher than 2.5%, 
and thus the allele frequencies of these muta-
tions were typically consistent with the state of 
morphologic complete remission (<5% blast cells 
in the bone marrow).
Because DTA mutations have been established 
as the most common gene mutations in persons 
with age-related clonal hematopoiesis,14-19 the 
persistent DTA mutations might have represented 
nonleukemic clones that repopulated the bone 
marrow after induction therapy. Among patients 
who had both DTA mutations and non-DTA mu-
tations at diagnosis, non-DTA mutations were 
generally cleared after induction chemotherapy, 
whereas DTA mutations often remained detect-
able during complete remission and were the 
only persistent mutations in 90 of 133 (67.7%) of 
those patients (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). These observations are consistent with 
the notion that residual cells bearing DTA muta-
tions after induction therapy represent nonleu-
kemic clones rather than persistent malignant 
disease.
Relapse and Survival End Points
In the training cohort (283 patients), we found that 
the detection of any persistent mutation during 
complete remission was associated with an in-
creased risk of relapse (4-year relapse rate, 48.2% 
with detection vs. 32.4% with no detection; 
P 
= 
0.03) (Fig. S4A in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). We then imposed various thresholds for 
allele frequency to determine whether the prog-
nostic value of the persistent mutations would 
improve after the exclusion of mutations with a 
high allele frequency, which could indicate a 
state of clonal hematopoiesis. The correlation of 
persistent mutations with an increased relapse 
risk appeared to be independent of allele fre-
quency. A correlation with relapse risk generally 
remained present when we excluded persistent 
mutations with allele frequencies at or above the 
following thresholds: 30% (P 
= 
0.09), 20% (P 
= 
0.11), 
10% (P 
= 
0.01), 5% (P 
= 
0.04), 2.5% (P 
= 
0.007), 
and 1% (P 
= 
0.07) (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The exclusion of persistent mutations 
with certain allele frequencies had no clear ef-
fect on the relationship between persistent mu-
tations and an increased relapse risk, thus pre-
cluding the identification of a threshold for 
allele frequency that could be used to distin-
guish populations at higher or lower risk for 
relapse. As we mentioned previously, the patients 
with persistent mutations at high allele frequen-
cies were enriched for DTA mutations (Fig. 1B).
We next determined whether persistent DTA 
mutations, which are associated with age-related 
clonal hematopoiesis, might be correlated with

an increased relapse risk. We observed that the 
detection of persistent DTA mutations was not 
significantly associated with a higher 4-year re-
lapse rate than no detection (P 
= 
0.29). The ab-
sence of a correlation was independent of allele 
frequency. No significant correlation of persistent 
DTA mutations with an increased relapse risk was 
apparent when we excluded persistent DTA muta-
tions with allele frequencies at or above the fol-
lowing thresholds: 30% (P 
= 
0.91), 20% (P 
= 
0.66), 
10% (P 
= 
0.89), 5% (P 
= 
0.82), 2.5% (P 
= 
0.53), and 
1% (P 
= 
0.92) (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). In contrast, among patients who had 
persistent DTA mutations during complete remis-
sion, coexisting persistent non-DTA mutations had 
high prognostic value with respect to relapse 
(4-year relapse rate, 66.7% with detection vs. 
39.4% with no detection; P 
= 
0.002) (Fig. 2A). Thus, 
in patients with persistent DTA mutations, the pres-
ence of residual disease that specifically includ-
ed coexisting non-DTA mutations represented a 
predictor of impending relapse.
We next assessed whether persistent non-DTA 
mutations might be correlated with an increased 
relapse risk. The detection of persistent non-DTA 
mutations at any allele frequency was strongly 
associated with an increased relapse risk (4-year 
relapse rate, 55.7% with detection vs. 34.6% with 
no detection; P 
= 
0.001) (Fig. 2B), as well as with 
reduced relapse-free survival (4-year rate of re-
lapse-free survival, 56.7% with detection vs. 36.6% 
with no detection; P 
= 
0.006) and reduced overall 
survival (4-year rate of overall survival, 65.3% with 
detection vs. 43.7% with no detection; P 
= 
0.01) 
(Fig. 2C, and Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
To assess the reproducibility of these results, 
we evaluated the effect of sequencing-based de-
tection of persistent non-DTA mutations during 
complete remission on the rates of relapse, re-
lapse-free survival, and overall survival in the 
validation cohort (147 patients). The rates with 
detection versus no detection were as follows: 
4-year relapse rate, 55.1% versus 26.5% (P<0.001); 
4-year rate of relapse-free survival, 60.6% versus 
35.6% (P<0.001); and 4-year rate of overall sur-
vival, 67.6% versus 37.1% (P<0.001) (Fig. 2B and 
2C, and Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The results in the validation cohort confirmed the 
significant findings in the training cohort.
In the combined training and validation cohorts 
(a total of 430 patients), persistent non-DTA mu-
tations were detected during complete remission 
in 28.4% of the patients. Detection of these muta-
tions was associated with a significantly higher 
4-year relapse rate than no detection (55.4% vs. 
31.9%; hazard ratio, 2.14; 95% confidence inter-
val [CI], 1.57 to 2.91; P<0.001), as well as with 
lower 4-year rates of relapse-free survival (36.6% 
vs. 58.1%; hazard ratio for relapse or death, 1.92; 
95% CI, 1.46 to 2.54; P<0.001) and overall sur-
vival (41.9% vs. 66.1%; hazard ratio for death, 
2.06; 95% CI, 1.52 to 2.79; P<0.001) (Fig. S6 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Multivariate and Sensitivity Analyses
We performed multivariate analyses that accounted 
for the major established relevant prognostic 
factors, including age, white-cell count, 2017 Eu-
ropean Leukemia Network risk classification, 
and the number of cycles of induction chemo-
therapy needed to attain complete remission. 
Sequencing-based detection of non-DTA muta-
tions maintained significant independent prog-
nostic value with respect to the rates of relapse 
(hazard ratio, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.34 to 2.65; P<0.001), 
relapse-free survival (hazard ratio for relapse or 
death, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.20; P 
= 
0.001), and 
overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 1.64; 95% 
CI, 1.18 to 2.27; P 
= 
0.003) (Table 2). No significant 
interactions were apparent between the detec-
tion of residual disease and the other prognostic 
factors in the multivariate model, type of consolida-
tion therapy, or disease entity (AML vs. refractory 
anemia with excess of blasts) (data not shown).
In sensitivity analyses involving correction for 
variation in the time at which bone marrow speci-
mens were obtained for sequencing analysis (with-
in the remission period of 21 days to 4 months 
after the second treatment cycle), the prognostic 
value of sequencing-based detection of non-DTA 
mutations with respect to the rates of relapse, 
relapse-free survival, and overall survival remained 
unaffected (Table S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). In addition, an analysis that included 
postremission treatment with allogeneic stem-
cell transplantation as a time-dependent variable 
conferred no effect on the prognostic value of 
the detection of residual disease (Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).

Minimal Residual Disease in AML
Detection of Residual Disease with 
Multiparameter Flow Cytometry
Multiparameter flow cytometry is an increasingly 
used method for predicting relapse in patients 
with AML who are in complete remission.7,24 We 
compared next-generation sequencing for the de-
tection of persistent non-DTA mutations with flow 
cytometry for the detection of residual disease in 
a representative subgroup of 340 patients, from 
whom sufficient samples were obtained for both 
analyses. Concordant results (either detection or 
no detection on both assays) were found in 69.1% 
of the patients (30 patients with detection and 
205 with no detection), whereas persistent non-
DTA mutations were detected only on sequencing 
in 64 patients and only on flow cytometry in 41 
Figure 2. Rates of Relapse and Overall Survival.
Shown is the cumulative incidence of relapse among patients in the training cohort with persistent DTA mutations, according to the 
 
detection of coexisting persistent non-DTA mutations during complete remission (Panel A), and among all patients in the training and 
validation cohorts, according to the detection of any persistent non-DTA mutations during complete remission (Panel B). Panel C shows

patients in whom both assays were positive, 
52.3% among those who had residual disease on 
sequencing but not on flow cytometry, 49.8% 
among those who had residual disease on flow 
cytometry but not on sequencing, and 26.7% 
among those in whom both assays were negative 
(Fig. 3). In a multivariate analysis that combined 
the results of sequencing and flow cytometry, the 
combined use of the two assays for the detection 
of residual disease conferred independent prog-
nostic value with respect to the rates of relapse 
(P<0.001), relapse-free (P<0.001), and overall sur-
vival (P 
=

Appendix).
Discussion
In addition to the presence of genetic abnormali-
ties at diagnosis, the continued presence of par-
ticular gene mutations during or after treatment 
carries prognostic information for certain geneti-
cally defined AML subtypes.5-11 This applies, for 
example, to AML associated with a mutation in 
NPM1, for which the detection of a residual mu-
tation in NPM1 transcripts during complete re-
mission is indicative of an increased probability 
of relapse.8,9 However, this example is only rep-
resentative of a single-gene approach. We report 
the results of a systematic study that involved a 
large number of patients with AML, in which we 
used a genomewide approach to evaluate the per-
sistence of multiple gene mutations for the effect 
on treatment outcomes. Patients were treated with 
intensive chemotherapy regimens and attained 
morphologic complete remission, with a median 
follow-up exceeding 3 years.
Of note, age-related clonal hematopoiesis,14-17 
which is characterized by recurrent somatic mu-
tations in leukemia-associated genes in persons 
with no apparent hematologic disease, adds a 
challenge in the detection of residual disease. Our 
study showed that the persistence of mutations 
that are most commonly associated with age-
related clonal hematopoiesis (i.e., DTA mutations 
[mutations in DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1]) during 
complete remission did not contribute to a mea-
surably increased risk of relapse within a follow-
up period of 4 years in adults with AML who 
were younger than 65 years of age. This appeared 
to be true for mutations that were present at 
various allele frequencies, which suggests that the

Minimal Residual Disease in AML
clone size in age-related clonal hematopoiesis 
yields no prognostic value with respect to the 
end points defined in this study.
The cells bearing DTA mutations appeared to 
persist and possess a selective clonal advantage 
over normal stem cells when they repopulated 
the bone marrow after induction therapy. This 
finding is consistent with the competitive clonal 
advantage of hematopoietic stem cells with defi-
ciencies and mutations in DNMT3A and TET2, an 
advantage that has been reported previously.25-27 
The proliferative advantage of hematopoietic stem 
cells with DTA mutations and their capacity to 
withstand chemotherapy because of inherent re-
sistance may explain why persistent premalignant 
DTA mutations were not correlated with an in-
creased probability of relapse and thereby did 
not constitute a reliable molecular biomarker for 
the assessment of relapse risk.
It is possible that gene mutations other than 
DTA mutations also partially reflect clonal hema-
topoiesis. However, at this time, we cannot rig-
orously verify the possibility that gene mutations 
associated with age-related clonal hematopoiesis 
also reside as subfractions among the other gene 
abnormalities in leukemia cells. In addition, mu-
tations in TP53, IDH1, and IDH2, along with genes 
related to the RAS pathway and spliceosome 
genes, have been shown to have distinct biologic 
features in the context of AML pathogenesis.28-31 
Therefore, in this study, we collectively considered 
non-DTA mutations to be abnormalities that are 
unrelated to clonal hematopoiesis.
Our study had a median follow-up of almost 
40 months. Among patients with AML who have 
complete remission, most relapses generally oc-
cur within the first 4 years. We found that the 
continued persistence of DTA mutations was not 
associated with an increased relapse risk, and thus 
these residual cells may not need to be eliminated 
to prevent relapse. However, the limited follow-up 
of 40 months does not rule out the possibility that 
persistent DTA mutations represent an increased 
risk of relapse at a later time point.
Although sequencing-based detection enables 
assessment for residual disease in virtually all 
patients with AML, it is imperfect in two ways. 
First, not all patients with residual mutation-bear-
ing cells have a relapse. Second, some patients 
with no measurable residual disease have a re-
lapse. It is conceivable that relapse estimation can 
be improved with the development of technologi-
cal variations of sequencing-based approaches 
that have greater sensitivity or a broader scope 
(e.g., those with molecular barcoding, exome se-
quencing, or whole-genome sequencing) or with 
the identification of additional molecular and 
phenotypic markers so that quantitative minor 
clones or subclones associated with the leuke-
mia are captured by the assay. In this respect, it 
is of particular interest that the use of multipa-
rameter flow cytometry
7,24 — which identifies 
patients with AML who have an increased risk of 
relapse according to an entirely different approach 
that is based on a residual leukemia-associated im-
munophenotype23,32 — can increase the yield of 
identification of residual leukemia during complete 
remission.
In this study, gene sequencing and multipa-
rameter flow cytometry each had independent 
and additive prognostic value with respect to rates 
of relapse and survival in patients with AML. The 
detection of residual leukemia with both methods 
is associated with an excessively high probability 
of relapse (approximately 75%), and the absence 
of detection of residual disease with both meth-
ods is correlated with a relatively low probability 
of relapse (approximately 25%). Thus, the com-
bined use of sequencing and flow cytometry dur-

ing complete remission warrants further develop-
ment and evaluation in clinical practice.
In conclusion, targeted sequencing-based de-
tection of molecular minimal residual disease dur-
ing complete remission was associated with an 
increased risk of relapse or death in patients with 
AML. However, over a 4-year follow-up period, 
the risk of relapse or death was not influenced by 
the persistence of genetic lesions that are associ-
ated with age-related clonal hematopoiesis.
