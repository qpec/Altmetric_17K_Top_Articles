Abstract
Objective: To conduct meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to estimate the effect of
eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid (EPAþDHA) on coronary heart disease (CHD), and to
conduct meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies to estimate the association between EPAþDHA intake
and CHD risk.
Methods: A systematic literature search of Ovid/Medline, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library
from January 1, 1947, to November 2, 2015, was conducted; 18 RCTs and 16 prospective cohort studies
examining EPAþDHA from foods or supplements and CHD, including myocardial infarction, sudden
cardiac death, coronary death, and angina, were identified. Random-effects meta-analysis models were
used to generate summary relative risk estimates (SRREs) and 95% CIs. Heterogeneity was examined in
subgroup and sensitivity analyses and by meta-regression. Dose-response was evaluated in stratified dose
or intake analyses. Publication bias assessments were performed.
Results: Among RCTs, there was a nonstatistically significant reduction in CHD risk with EPAþDHA
provision (SRRE¼0.94; 95% CI, 0.85-1.05). Subgroup analyses of data from RCTs indicated a statistically
significant CHD risk reduction with EPAþDHA provision among higher-risk populations, including
participants with elevated triglyceride levels (SRRE¼0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.98) and elevated low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (SRRE¼0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.98). Meta-analysis of data from prospective cohort
studies resulted in a statistically significant SRRE of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.74-0.92) for higher intakes of
EPAþDHA and risk of any CHD event.
Conclusion: Results indicate that EPAþDHA may be associated with reducing CHD risk, with a greater
benefit observed among higher-risk populations in RCTs.

 to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis of
prospective cohort studies to estimate the as-
sociation
between
EPAþDHA
intake
and
CHD risk. Additional objectives included
examining the effects of dose, as well as the ef-
fects of EPAþDHA on specific outcomes (eg,
myocardial infarction) and among higher-risk
populations (eg, those with elevated triglycer-
ide levels) using subgroup analyses and meta-
regression.
METHODS
We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guide-
lines (see Supplemental Figure 1, available on-
line at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org)
for this systematic review and meta-analysis.3
Literature Search and Study Selection
Comprehensive literature searches using the
PubMed, Ovid/Medline, and Embase data-
bases were conducted. The Cochrane Library
was also reviewed. Literature searches, which
covered studies published from January 1,
1947, through November 2, 2015, were
designed to identify RCTs and prospective
cohort studies that examined EPAþDHA and
CHD outcomes. The full Ovid Medline search
strategy is included as Supplemental Material
(see Supplemental Figure 2, available online
at
http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org).
Level I screening included review of all titles
and/or
abstracts.
Supplementary
literature
searches included examining the reference lists
of
all
relevant
studies,
published
meta-
analyses, and the report published by the
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
Technical Review in 2012.4 In addition, previ-
ously published reviews were scrutinized to
identify pertinent studies that may not have
been captured in our electronic searches.5-10
Full-text publications of all studies not elimi-
nated at level I were retrieved for complete re-
view at level II screening. All search results
were screened by 2 individuals, with minor
differences resolved by discussion and consul-
tation with a third researcher.
Included studies were required to report 1
or more of the following CHD outcomes:
myocardial
infarction
(fatal
or
nonfatal),
angina, sudden cardiac death, coronary death,
and CHD incidence (for prospective cohort
studies).
Study
populations
included
nonhospitalized adults (>18 y) with and
without CHD but otherwise free of significant
noneCHD-related
disease
pathologies.
Studies were required to report hazard ratios
(HR) or rate ratios (RR) of outcomes and mea-
sures of variance (ie, 95% CIs), or data were
required to be available to calculate such mea-
sures. Additional information on the inclusion
criteria, data extraction methods, and evalua-
tion
of
study
quality
are
available
in
Supplemental Figure 3 (available online at
http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org).
For the RCTs, a composite variable, “any
CHD event,” was created and defined as the
combination of fatal or nonfatal myocardial
infarction (MI), coronary death, sudden car-
diac death, and angina. Fatal CHD events
included fatal MI, coronary death, and sudden
cardiac death. Nonfatal CHD events included
nonfatal MI and angina. Coronary death
included all fatal events minus sudden cardiac
death. Individual events, that is, sudden car-
diac death, were also analyzed separately.
For the prospective cohort studies, “any
CHD event” was defined as the combination
of fatal or nonfatal MI, CHD incidence, coro-
nary death, sudden cardiac death, and angina;
fatal CHD events included fatal MI, coronary
death, and sudden cardiac death; and nonfatal
CHD events included angina, CHD incidence,
and nonfatal MI.
Statistical Analyses
Primary
statistical
analyses
using
meta-
analysis
methodology
were
based
on
comparing rates of total CHD events, as
well as specific CHD event outcomes between
the EPAþDHA group and the control group.
If studies did not report RRs, the absolute rate
of CHD events was calculated for each group
and then compared to produce an RR and
95%
CI.
Random-effects
meta-analysis
models were used to generate summary rela-
tive risk estimates (SRREs) and 95% CIs.
Summary associations were interpreted as sta-
tistically significant (ie, P<.05) if the 95% CIs
did not include the null value of 1.0 in their
range. The study weights were equal to the
inverse of the variance of each study’s effect
estimate according to the methodology devel-
oped by DerSimonian and Laird.11 If data for
specific mutually exclusive CHD events, but
not CHD overall, were reported in the same

 study, results data from that study were com-
bined using a fixed effects model to produce a
single risk estimate for total CHD. For the
RCTs, meta-analysis models were generated
for overall study population analyses as well
as for subgroup-specific analyses. Stratified
dose meta-analyses based on levels above
and below 1 g/d were conducted. In addition,
meta-regression analyses based on increasing
EPAþDHA dose and CHD risk were per-
formed. Meta-regression was also used to
evaluate the impact of study quality on
observed summary associations. Given the
larger sample size for “any CHD event”
compared with specific CHD events, such as
fatal MI, a greater number of subgroup-
specific and sensitivity analyses were possible
for this category. The subgroup analyses were
conducted to identify potential sources of
between-study variation and to estimate the
effect of EPAþDHA for specific subpopula-
tions and study characteristics. To determine
the influence that each individual study (RCT
or prospective cohort study) had on the
overall summary effect in the primary meta-
analysis models, one-study removed sensi-
tivity analyses, whereby the meta-analysis is
conducted multiple times with a single study
removed, were undertaken.
Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using
Cochran’s Q, which tests for between-study
statistical variation. A Cochran’s Q P value
of .10 or less in a specific meta-analysis model
is an indication of statistically significant het-
erogeneity of the intervention effects across
the RCTs or the associations across the

 prospective cohort studies. This P value for
heterogeneity is not a significance test for the
relationship
between
the
exposure
(ie,
EPAþDHA) and the outcome (eg, CHD). In
addition, the I2 statistic, which indicates the
percentage
of
variation
attributable
to
between-study heterogeneity, is shown in the
forest plot figures for the primary analyses.
The presence of publication bias was assessed
visually by examining a funnel plot measuring
the standard error as a function of effect size,
as well as statistically by using Egger’s regres-
sion method.12 All statistical analyses were
performed
using
Comprehensive
Meta-
Analysis (version 3.2.00089; Biostat).
RESULTS
Descriptive Study Characteristics
A flow diagram of the literature search and
study selection is shown in Figure 1; 18
RCTs (21 publications)13-33 and 16 prospec-
tive
cohort
studies
(18
publications)34-51
were included in the meta-analysis. Studies
excluded after full-text review are listed in
Supplemental Table 1 (available online at
http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org).
The
main study characteristics of the RCTs and
prospective cohort studies are summarized in
Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Approxi-
mately 93,000 subjects were included in the
meta-analysis of RCT data and 732,000 sub-
jects were included in the meta-analysis of
prospective cohort studies.
Meta-Analyses Results
Results from meta-analyses of RCTs and pro-
spective
cohort
studies
are
reported
in
Tables 3 and 4, with the primary meta-
analytic findings summarized in Figure 2.
Results from additional subgroup and meta-
regression analyses are also presented in
Supplemental Table 2 (available online at
http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org).
In the overall meta-analysis of RCT data,
EPAþDHA provision was associated with a
nonstatistically
significant
SRRE
of
0.94
(95% CI, 0.85-1.05) for any CHD event
(Figure 2A). Statistical heterogeneity in this
RCT model (P¼.07) was explained in part by
differences in several study characteristics,
including
baseline
triglyceride
and
low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol. Participants

cRRs and 95% CIs included in at least 1 of the meta-analyses or combined using a fixed effects model to produce a single risk estimate for “any CHD event” or other composite outcome are shown.
dWhen a series of publications from the same cohort were available, data from only the most recent publication were used in the meta-analysis except in cases in which earlier publications provided estimates for unique outcomes
not presented in the most recent publication. In these cases, outcome data from the earlier publication(s) were also included in the meta-analysis. This approach resulted in only 17 prospective cohort studies in the any CHD
event model as Mozaffarian et al46 was used in place of Ascherio et al37 because Ascherio et al37 reported only total MI vs Mozaffarian et al,46 which reported more recent data including collective coronary events for the HPFS
cohort. Ascherio et al,37 however, was used in the statistical model for total MI because these authors provided this outcome for the HPFS cohort, but Mozaffarian et al46 did not.

and elevated low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol
(SRRE¼0.86;
95%
CI,
0.76-0.98)
(Figure 2C) experienced statistically significant
reduced CHD events, respectively. Further-
more, higher dose (above 1 g/d of EPAþDHA)
had a stronger impact among those with
elevated triglyceride levels (SRRE¼0.75; 95%
CI, 0.64-0.89) compared with trials of less
than 1 g/d of EPAþDHA (SRRE¼0.93; 95%
CI, 0.82-1.07).
The SRRE for any CHD event was 0.83 in
the subgroup analysis of RCTs administering
1 g/d or more of EPAþDHA, but this finding
was not statistically significant (95% CI, 0.61-
1.14) (see Supplemental Figure 4, available
online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.
org). Meta-regression
did not
produce
a
continuous
dose-response
effect
when
including data for less than 1 g/d of EPAþDHA
with all other dose groups (see Supplemental
Figure 5, available online at http://www.
mayoclinicproceedings.org).
Participants
in
RCTs who received EPAþDHA were less likely
(SRRE¼0.81; 95% CI, 0.65-1.00) to have a cor-
onary death event compared with those who
received a placebo; the effect was not modified
by dose level but the summary association was
stronger among secondary prevention studies
(Table 3). No apparent effect modification was
found by prevention status (primary, second-
ary, or mixed), prevalence of diabetes medica-
tion use (Table 3), or in subgroup analyses by
duration of follow-up, use of an implantable
cardioverter defibrillator, or hypertensive status
(Supplemental Table 2) among participants in
RCTs.

 Visual examination of funnel plots and sta-
tistical testing of data from the RCTs revealed
no
apparent
publication
bias
(see
Supplemental Figure 6, available online at
http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org).
In
the overall analysis of any CHD event, removal
of any single RCT did not modify appreciably
the summary association (range of SRRE based
on 1 study removed at a time, 0.92-0.98) (see
Supplemental Figure 7, available online at
http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org)
or
alter the level of statistical significance. The
Cochrane Bias Assessment score for each RCT
(see Supplemental Figure 8, available online at
http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org)
was
modeled as a linear variable. Meta-regression
of the log risk ratio of the Cochrane Bias Assess-
ment score on CHD risk did not result in a sta-
tistically significant quality response trend (beta
coefficient¼0.01; P¼.64) (see Supplemental
Figure 9, available online at http://www.
mayoclinicproceedings.org).
Statistically significant inverse associations
were
observed
among prospective
cohort
studies for any CHD event (SRRE¼0.82;
95% CI, 0.74-0.92) (Figure 2D), fatal CHD
events (SRRE¼0.77; 95% CI, 0.66-0.90), cor-
onary death (SRRE¼0.82; 95% CI, 0.69-
0.98), and sudden cardiac death (SRRE¼0.53;
95% CI, 0.41-0.67), with nonstatistically sig-
nificant inverse associations found for nonfatal
CHD events, coronary events, and nonfatal MI
(Table 4). Between-study statistical variation
was observed in all prospective cohort models
(indicated by the P values for heterogeneity),
except for sudden cardiac death (P¼.62;
Table 4). However, of note, the direction of
association was similar for the large majority
of prospective cohort studies (ie, most indi-
vidual study’s RRs were below 1.0; Table 4).
The funnel plot revealed slight asymmetry
around the effect size but the potential for
publication
bias
was inconsequential (see
Supplemental Figure 10, available online at
http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org).
The
number of Newcastle-Ottawa Score stars for
each
prospective
cohort
study
(see
Supplemental Table 3, available online at
http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org)
was
modeled as a linear variable. Meta-regression
of the log risk ratio of the Newcastle-Ottawa

tistically significant quality response trend
(beta
coefficient¼0.04;
P¼.50)
(see
Supplemental Figure 11, available online at
http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org). Fur-
thermore, removal of any single prospective
cohort study did not modify the summary as-
sociation for any CHD event (range of SRRE
based on 1 study removed at a time, 0.80-
0.85; data not shown) or alter the precision
of the CIs.

 DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the most comprehen-
sive quantitative assessment of the relationship
between
EPAþDHA
supplementation
and
intake and CHD risk to date. Our inclusion
criteria were specific for CHD, which distin-
guishes our findings from those of other
meta-analyses that included a mixture of
vascular as well as less well defined coronary
outcomes. Collectively, the SRREs for RCT
data were relatively consistent across all types
of analyses with many statistically significant
inverse effects that were supported by inverse
associations between EPAþDHA intake and
all coronary outcomes across the prospective
cohort studies.
A well-documented effect of n-3 LCPUFA
supplementation is the reduction in serum tri-
glyceride levels in subjects with hypertriglyceri-
demia.52 Although large-scale RCTs examining

 the effect of lowering triglyceride levels among
those with hypertriglyceridemia are underway
(eg, Outcomes Study to Assess STatin Residual
Risk Reduction with EpaNova in HiGh CV
Risk
PatienTs
with
Hypertriglyceridemia
[STRENGTH], see clintrials.gov), results from
currently available prospective cohort studies
indicate that elevated triglyceride levels are asso-
ciated with increasing CHD risk.53 Our results
indicate that EPAþDHA provision reduced
CHD risk among subjects with triglyceride
levels of 150 mg/dL or more in RCTs but not
among those with triglyceride levels within
normal limits. Similarly, a CHD risk reduction
benefit of n-3 LCPUFA provision was found
among RCT subjects with low-density lipopro-
tein (LDL) cholesterol levels of 130 mg/dL or
more but not for those with LDL cholesterol
levels of less than 130 mg/dL. Although past
meta-analyses have shown that n-3 LCPUFA
administration may increase LDL cholesterol
levels (particularly in patients with very high tri-
glyceride levels),52,54 the beneficial effect of n-3
LCPUFA on CHD seen in subjects with higher
LDL cholesterol levels in this analysis may
reflect the redistribution of LDL cholesterol to
larger, less atherogenic LDL particles that has
been reported following n-3 LCPUFA supple-
mentation in a number of RCTs.55,56 These
findings are particularly relevant for the man-
agement of CHD risk in the general US
population because 25% of Americans older
than 20 years are estimated to have triglyceride
levels of 150 mg/dL57 or more and 27% of
Americans aged between 40 and 74 years have
LDL
cholesterol levels of 130
mg/dL or
more.58
Blood
pressure
is
another
well-
documented CHD risk factor impacted favor-
ably by n-3 LCPUFA administration.59
Our findings are relatively consistent with
previous meta-analyses from the last 10 years
for which 10% to 30% decreased risks of
cardiac/coronary death have been observed
with
provision
or
greater
intakes
of
n-3
LCPUFA.5-9,60-62 In a meta-analysis of prospec-
tive cohort studies, Chowdhury et al63 reported
a statistically significant 13% (RR¼0.87; 95%
CI, 0.78-0.97) CHD risk reduction with greater
n-3 LCPUFA intake and a statistically significant
25% (RR¼0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.89) CHD risk
reduction with higher circulating EPAþDHA
levels. Casula et al61 conducted a meta-analysis
of RCTs in which at least 1 g/d of n-3 LCPUFA
was administered, and reported statistically sig-
nificant
inverse
effects
for
cardiac
death
(RR¼0.68; 95% CI, 0.56-0.83), sudden death
(RR¼0.67;
95%
CI,
0.52-0.87),
and
MI
(RR¼0.75;
95%
CI,
0.63-0.88).
In
our
subgroup analysis of RCTs in which at least
1 g/d of EPAþDHA was administered, reduced
risks of most coronary outcomes, including any
CHD event, MI, nonfatal MI, coronary death,
FIGURE 2. Forest plots derived from random-effects meta-analysis models depicting the effect of EPAþDHA on any CHD event in
RCTs among all subjects (A), among subjects with baseline triglyceride levels of more than 150 mg/dL (B), and among subjects with
baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of more than 130 mg/dL (C), and the association between EPAþDHA intake and
any CHD event in prospective cohort studies (D). Circles represent the RR within the individual studies; 95% CIs are represented by
horizontal lines. Circle size is proportional to the weight of each study. Diamonds represent the SRRE. Summary associations were
interpreted as statistically significant if the 95% CIs did not include the null value of 1.0 in their range. Any CHD event includes fatal or
nonfatal MI, coronary death, sudden cardiac death, and angina, as well as CHD incidence in prospective cohort studies. If a study did
not report a variable for total CHD events, specific events were combined to create a composite CHD variable. When a series of
publications from the same prospective cohort study were available, data only from the most recent publication were used in the
meta-analysis except in cases in which earlier publications provided estimates for unique outcomes not presented in the most recent
publication. In these cases, outcome data from the earlier publication(s) were also included in the meta-analysis. This approach
resulted in only 17 prospective cohort studies in the any CHD event model as Mozaffarian et al46 was used in place of Ascherio et al37
because Ascherio et al37 reported only total MI vs Mozaffarian et al,46 which reported more recent data including collective coronary
events for the HPFS cohort. Ascherio et al,37 however, was used in the statistical model for total MI because these authors provided
this outcome for the HPFS cohort, but Mozaffarian et al did not. CHD ¼ coronary heart disease; DHA ¼ docosahexaenoic acid;
EPA ¼ eicosapentaenoic acid; HPFS ¼ Health Professionals Follow-up Study; MI ¼ myocardial infarction; P-H ¼ P value for het-
erogeneity in statistical model; RCT ¼ randomized controlled trial; RR ¼ relative risk; SRRE ¼ summary relative risk estimate.
Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran’s Q, which tests for between-study statistical variation. In a conventional meta-
analysis, a Cochran’s Q P value of .10 or less is an indication of statistically significant heterogeneity. It is noteworthy that this P value is
only an indication that statistical variability may be present in a specific meta-analysis model, and this P value is not a significance test
for the relationship between the exposure (ie, EPAþDHA) and the outcome (eg, CHD).

 and angina, were observed, although most
were
not
statistically
significant,
with
the
exception of nonfatal MI (SRRE¼0.71; 95% CI,
0.53-0.97).
Findings from our meta-analysis models of
RCTs were supported by strong and consis-
tent, statistically significant inverse associa-
tions in meta-analyses of prospective cohort
studies. These results expand upon findings
from a previous meta-analysis of prospective
cohort studies that examined fish consump-
tion and CHD mortality; Zheng et al64 re-
ported RRs of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.67-0.92) and
0.83 (95% CI, 0.68-1.01) for 2 to 4 servings
of fish/wk and 5þ servings of fish/wk, respec-
tively, and CHD. Stronger inverse associations
for n-3 LCPUFA and CHD in observational
studies (including prospective cohort studies)
compared with RCTs have also been reported
in other reviews and meta-analyses.65,66 There
are many design and methodological differ-
ences between RCTs and prospective cohort
studies. More than 50% of cardiac deaths
occur among individuals without diagnosed
heart disease, and large prospective cohort
studies are able to evaluate populations that
are healthy at baseline and free of the changes
in dietary habits and medications that result
from disease diagnosis.67 Moreover, it is
more feasible and economical to evaluate
longer follow-up periods using a prospective
cohort
study
design.
Prospective
cohort
studies are typically longer in duration than
RCTs, and dietary intake data collected in
these studies may be more representative of
life-long eating habits. Cardiovascular benefits
have been observed at lower EPAþDHA intake
levels in studies of longer duration.46 Most
RCTs, in comparison, are shorter in duration
and evaluate subjects with established CHD
or who are at high risk to maximize power
and minimize cost.67 However, a foremost
advantage of RCTs is the ostensibly greater
ability to control for confounding through
random
allocation
of
exposure.
Findings
from prospective cohort studies and RCTs
are both important, and results from prospec-
tive cohort studies may provide guidance for
first-line treatments for the prevention of
CHD.67 Despite methodological differences,
our analyses by study type (ie, RCTs and pro-
spective cohort studies) should be viewed as
complementary,
offering
a
comprehensive
summary of the state-of-the-epidemiologic sci-
ence on EPAþDHA provision and intake.
As
expected
when
summarizing
and
analyzing data from the peer-reviewed litera-
ture, some potential limitations and sources
of variability should be noted. In the current
meta-analysis, the individual RCTs differed in
terms of CHD prevalence at baseline, the
EPAþDHA dosage provided, follow-up dura-
tion, and the methods of patient selection
and
randomization.
The
benefit
of
n-3
LCPUFA intake is thought to accrue over
time; however, RCTs of longer duration may
suffer from poorer compliance with dietary
supplementation. For example, at the end of
5 years in the study by Roncaglioni et al,28
almost 1 in 5 participants in the n-3 LCPUFA
group
had
discontinued
supplementation.
Our method of data extraction was designed
to specifically address CHD outcomes. Despite
these differences, our sensitivity analyses did
not indicate that these factors contributed
meaningfully to differing patterns of summary
effects. The variable use of terminology spe-
cific to CHD outcomes, or a lack of specificity
required to discern CHD from broader cardio-
vascular disease outcomes, may have resulted
in the exclusion of some publications. All
but 1 study31 provided EPAþDHA in combi-
nation as opposed to either independently;
therefore, more RCTs are needed to fully eval-
uate the relationship between EPA and DHA,
alone or in combination, for reducing CHD
outcomes. Many of the RCTs lack statistical
power to detect an effect because of relatively
small sample sizes and/or few observed events
due to the increased survival rate associated
with current standards of care.68 However,
an inherent methodological strength in meta-
analyses is that combining data from similar
studies enhances the power to detect a statisti-
cally significant difference between groups,
given that the evidence base of studies reflects
the true nature of associations. Finally, most
RCTs did not measure baseline intake of
EPAþDHA from the diet nor track EPAþDHA
intake from sources other than that supple-
mented during the course of study, thus mak-
ing
it
impossible
to
determine
whether
background dietary EPAþDHA intake affected
the
relationship
between
supplemental
EPAþDHA and CHD. Prospective cohort
studies in nutritional epidemiology suffer

 from
several
methodological
limitations,
namely, the potential for inaccurate ascertain-
ment and classification of exposure, and un-
controlled
and
residual
confounding.
Analyses in the prospective cohort studies
included in the present meta-analyses were
based
on
self-reported
dietary
intakes,
although the CHD outcomes were based on
clinical reporting and validation. These limita-
tions notwithstanding, summary associations
across the prospective cohort study meta-
analyses were remarkably consistent, showing
a benefit for CHD outcomes.
Heart disease morbidity and mortality is the
foremost public health burden in the United
States69 and many countries worldwide.70
Poor diet is a leading cause of CHD burden
and one of the leading risk factors related to
disability-adjusted life-years.69 Because a diet
low in seafood omega-3 fatty acids is reported
as a contributor to ischemic heart disease
disability-adjusted life-years and is considered
a dietary risk factor with potentially significant
effects on mortality worldwide,71,72 authorita-
tive bodies recommend intake of EPAþDHA
for heart and overall health.2,73,74
CONCLUSION
Our comprehensive meta-analysis of data from
RCTs and prospective cohort studies supports
this recommendation. Although not statisti-
cally significant, a 6% reduced risk of any
CHD event was observed among RCTs, a
finding supported by a statistically significant
18% reduced risk of CHD among the prospec-
tive cohort studies. From a clinical perspec-
tive, our results indicate that EPAþDHA may
be associated with reducing CHD risk to a
greater extent in populations with elevated tri-
glyceride levels or LDL cholesterol, which are
risk factors that impact a significant portion
of the general adult population in the United
States. Additional RCTs with more homoge-
neous exposure and outcome classifications
with longer follow-up periods may continue
to provide a better understanding of the prom-
ising
beneficial
relationship
between
EPAþDHA and CHD risk.
