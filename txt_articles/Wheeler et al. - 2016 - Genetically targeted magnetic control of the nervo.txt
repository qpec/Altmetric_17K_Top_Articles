Abstract
Optogenetic and chemogenetic actuators are critical for deconstructing the neural correlates of 
behavior. However, these tools have several limitations, including invasive modes of stimulation or 
slow on/off kinetics. We have overcome these disadvantages by synthesizing a single component, 
magnetically sensitive actuator, “Magneto,” comprised of the cation channel, TRPV4, fused to the 
paramagnetic protein, ferritin. We validate non-invasive magnetic control over neuronal activity by 
demonstrating remote stimulation of cells using in vitro calcium imaging assays, 
electrophysiological recordings in brain slices, in vivo electrophysiological recordings in the 
brains of freely moving mice, and behavioral outputs in zebrafish and mice. As proof of concept, 
we used Magneto to delineate a causal role of striatal dopamine receptor 1 neurons in mediating 
reward behavior in mice. Together, our results present Magneto as a novel actuator capable of 
remotely controlling circuits associated with complex animal behaviors.
Introduction
Opto- and chemogenetic actuators have revealed critical properties of neural networks in 
normal and pathological states1–6. While both opto- and chemogenetics remotely control 
neuronal stimulation, optical strategies are limited spatially by poor light penetration into

 dense tissues and chemogenetic strategies suffer from slow pharmacokinetics that prevent 
cellular activation on a physiologically relevant timescale. Therefore, there remains a need 
for next generation actuators that are non-invasive and can respond rapidly and reversibly7. 
Several recent studies have reported transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) ion 
channels can be engineered to become sensitive to a combination of radiowaves and 
magnetothermal heating through coupling to the iron storage protein, ferritin, or to inorganic 
paramagnetic nanoparticles8–12. While these reagents represent an important advance, they 
are multicomponent systems (e.g. requiring delivery of nanoparticles and a genetically 
encoded channel) with possible off-target heating effects. One study has employed non-
thermal magnetogenetic control of somatic tissues to regulate blood glucose13, but a fully 
encoded, single component magnetogenetic system has yet to be applied to the nervous 
system. Here, we have expanded upon these strategies by engineering a magnetogenetic 
actuator through fusion of the non-selective cation channel, TRPV414–16, to the 
paramagnetic protein, ferritin17. We have successfully applied this actuator to the nervous 
system and validated it using in vitro calcium imaging, brain slice electrophysiology, in vivo 
electrophysiology, and acute modulation of behavior in freely moving zebrafish and mice.
Results
Design and screen of a novel magnetically sensitive cation channel
To engineer a novel single-component magnetogenetic actuator, we based our design on 
TRPV4 since it has been reported to respond to pressure14,15. We suspected that, when fused 
to TRPV4, a paramagnetic protein would enable magnetic torque to tug open the channel to 
depolarize cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). While we hypothesized that magnetic field 
dependent activation of TRPV4 would be more facile than using a non-mechanically 
sensitive ion channel, it may also be formally possible that application of torque to ion 
channels in general would achieve the same result. Therefore, we developed a small library 
of 21 proteins consisting of TRPV4 fused to a gene encoding two subunits of the 
paramagnetic ferritin protein (Supplementary Table 1)18. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 
293 cells did not express 18 of the 21 generated chimeric proteins following transient 
transfection, presumably due to cytotoxicity of the chimeric channels. For the three channels 
that did express in HEK293 cells, we performed in vitro calcium imaging to determine 
whether the fusion proteins responded to magnetic fields. Using the fluorescent calcium-
binding dye Fluo-4, we measured calcium transients in response to a ~50 mT magnetic field 
delivered by an electromagnet (Supplementary Fig. 2). Of the three candidate proteins, we 
observed detectable calcium transients in response to magnetic stimulation with one fusion 
protein, consisting of ferritin tethered to a truncated TRPV4 carboxyl-terminus (Δ760–871) 
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Because the 17±3.5% (mean±SEM) increase in magnetically 
evoked calcium transients was smaller than expected TRPV4 responses16 (Supplementary 
Fig. 3h), we hypothesized that trafficking to the plasma membrane was disrupted19, resulting 
in blunted calcium signaling. We next optimized the chimeric channel’s subcellular 
localization by adding a series of subcellular trafficking signals to Magneto akin to the 
optimization of optogenetic actuators20,21. Ultimately, we determined that the addition of a 
plasma membrane trafficking signal enhanced the prototype channel’s membrane expression 
(Supplementary Fig. 4), and we dubbed this improved channel “Magneto2.0.” We confirmed

 that HEK293 cells were viable after Magneto2.0 expression (Supplementary Fig. 5) and then 
measured magnetic field dependent calcium transients produced by Magneto2.0 using the 
paradigm described in Supplementary Fig. 3. We observed that cells expressing Magneto2.0 
(58% transfected cells, n=6 coverslips, n=539 cells) exhibited robust calcium transients 
approximately 2.5-fold higher than baseline after 50 mT magnetic stimulation with no 
change in any of the control conditions (Fig. 1a–f). Controls included: (1) cells expressing 
non-fused TRPV4 and ferritin moieties, (2) unstimulated Magneto2.0 expressing cells, (3) 
Magneto2.0 expressing cells exposed to the TRP pore blocker ruthenium red (RR), and (4) 
Magneto2.0 expressing cells in Ca2+ free extracellular media. We observed calcium influx 
immediately following magnetic stimulation but invariably, maximal calcium fluorescence 
was observed minutes after magnetic field stimulation of Magneto2.0 expressing cells, 
which was not observed in any of the above control conditions (Fig. 1g). We found that the 
delayed calcium response in Magneto2.0+ cells was caused by calcium release from 
intracellular stores following magnetically induced depolarization since this secondary 
response was eliminated following depletion of intracellular calcium stores by thapsigargin, 
a sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium transport ATPase pump inhibitor22 (Supplementary 
Fig. 6). However, we sought to determine if the increase in calcium signaling concomitant 
with magnetic field stimulation was GSK205 sensitive, which would suggest that the signal 
is TRPV4 dependent23. We thus stimulated and quantified the change in calcium 
fluorescence of mCherry+ Magneto2.0-p2A-mCherry transfected cells during magnetic field 
application both in the presence and absence of the specific TRPV4 inhibitor GSK205. We 
observed a magnetic field dependent calcium increase in the GSK205-untreated Magneto2.0 
expressing cells compared to stimulated GSK205-treated cells (two-way ANOVA, 
p<0.0001) (Fig. 1h). Moreover, 70±5.1% (mean±SEM) of Magneto2.0+ cells responded to 
magnetic fields (n=3 coverslips, n=58 cells) with an average maximal change in calcium 
fluorescence of 29±9.8% (mean±SEM) during stimulation compared to only 6.5±0.9% 
(mean±SEM) for the GSK205-treated population (n=3 coverslips per condition, n=88 
GSK205-treated cells, n=57 untreated cells, unpaired two-tailed t-test, t143=2.819, 
p=0.0055). Importantly, all observed changes in calcium fluorescence were noticeably 
improved over the poorly trafficked prototype channel (Supplementary Figs. 3, 4a). These 
data demonstrate that Magneto2.0 is a magnetically sensitive, genetically encoded actuator 
that can manipulate cellular activity in vitro.
Electrophysiological characterization of Magneto2.0 in the mammalian brain
These preliminary experiments prompted us to precisely determine the temporal kinetics of 
Magneto2.0 activation since the future utility of Magneto2.0 is contingent on its rapid 
activation in response to magnetic fields in live tissues. To this end, we generated an adeno-
associated virus (AAV) to express Magneto2.0 in mammalian cells under control of the 
cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter using the double-floxed inverse open reading frame 
(DIO) approach (CMV::DIO-Magneto2.0). This strategy enables permanent Cre-dependent 
expression of a reversed lox site-flanked gene through Cre-lox mediated recombination (Fig. 
2a)24. We bilaterally co-injected the medial entorhinal cortices (mECs) of WT mice with an 
AAV1 containing CMV::DIO-Magneto2.0 and an AAV9 carrying Cre recombinase fused to 
enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under control of the calcium/calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase II alpha (CamKIIα) promoter (CamKIIα::Cre-EGFP), which will

 express Magneto2.0 in excitatory neurons (Fig. 2b). To test whether Magneto2.0 could elicit 
action potentials (APs) in neurons from brain slice preparations in response to magnetic 
fields, we recorded from EGFP+ neurons in the mEC of WT mice doubly transduced with 
AAVs carrying CMV::DIO-Magneto2.0 and CamKIIα::Cre-EGFP under whole-cell current 
clamp conditions. Upon application of a ~50 mT static magnetic field delivered by a NdFeB 
rare earth magnet, neurons in the mEC reliably fired a series of APs akin to spiking behavior 
evoked by injection of 300 pA of depolarizing current (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 7a). APs 
were elicited by both current injection and magnetic fields in 12/12 strongly EGFP+ neurons 
tested (n=5 mice; n=2 mice excluded due to low EGFP expression). Measurement of time to 
threshold and time to peak for APs evoked either by current injection or magnetic fields 
revealed no differences (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Membrane properties, such as resting 
membrane potential, AP amplitude, upstroke velocity, AP width, and firing threshold were 
similar between the two stimulation conditions (Supplementary Fig. 7c–g). As controls, we 
measured that magnetic stimulation initiated APs at a comparable rate to current injection 
(Supplementary Fig. 8a) and did not cause electrical interference in electrophysiology 
measurements (Supplementary Fig. 8b). To test if the magnetically evoked firing was due 
specifically to activation of TRPV4, we bathed brain slices in the selective TRPV4 
antagonist GSK205 (n=3 neurons from 3 mice). After a 10-minute incubation with GSK205, 
magnetic stimulation failed to evoke APs (Fig. 2c, right panel), suggesting that the observed 
APs were due to Magneto2.0 activation. To determine whether magnetic stimulation affects 
mEC neurons not expressing Magneto2.0, we magnetically stimulated cells transduced with 
AAVs delivering CMV::DIO-Magneto2.0 and CamKIIα::EGFP, thus preventing Cre-
dependent expression of Magneto2.0. We found that stimulation with magnetic fields did not 
evoke APs in non-Magneto2.0 expressing EGFP+ neurons of the mEC, although these 
neurons fired spike trains in response to injection with 300 pA of depolarizing current (n=6 
neurons from 3 mice) (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 7h). In sum, we found that only 
Magneto2.0-expressing neurons of the mEC fired APs in response to magnetic field 
stimulation, and bath application of GSK205 blocked these responses (Fig. 2e). These data 
support the notion that activation of Magneto2.0 can rapidly and reversibly depolarize 
neurons leading to remote control over neural circuit dynamics.
Genetically targeted remote magnetic control over zebrafish tactile behaviors
We next began validation of Magneto2.0 function in vivo. We first sought to remotely 
modulate a simple behavior of the zebrafish, Danio rerio. We transiently expressed 
Magneto2.0 in Rohon-Beard sensory neurons (5 Magneto2.0+ Rohon-Beard neurons per 
fish, n=9 fish), using regulatory sequences of the ngn1 promoter25,26. We identified mosaic 
zebrafish expressing Magneto2.0 in Rohon-Beard neurons by selecting for animals that also 
expressed a co-injectable fluorescent marker in the heart (Supplementary Fig. 9a). We 
sought to determine whether magnetic stimulation of zebrafish expressing Magneto2.0 led to 
an increase in calcium signaling within Rohon-Beard neurons. To this end, we performed 
GCaMP imaging of live, 48 hours post-fertilization (hpf) zebrafish larvae expressing 
Tg(s1020t::Gal4);Tg(UAS::GCaMP3);ngn1::Magneto2.0-p2A-mCherry, which enables 
detection of activated neurons through the genetically encoded calcium sensor, GCaMP327, 
which is expressed in ventral spinal cord neurons28. This transgenic combination enables 
direct visualization of calcium transients in response to magnetic stimulation through dual

 labeling of GCaMP3+ and mCherry+ Rohon-Beard neurons. We delivered a 50 mT static 
magnetic field via NdFeB rare earth magnets and observed an immediate increase in 
GCaMP3 fluorescence in stimulated Magneto2.0+, mCherry-labeled Rohon-Beard neurons 
but not in adjacent mCherry- neurons populating the spinal cord (Fig. 3a, Supplementary 
Fig. 10a). We determined that 17/20 mCherry+ neurons responded above the 6.9±0.15% 
(mean±SEM) average maximal fluorescence change of control, mCherry- cells 
(Supplementary Fig. 10a), suggesting that magnetic stimulation in vivo will reliably activate 
Magneto2.0+ neurons, consistent with both our calcium imaging and slice electrophysiology 
data. We next tested whether remote activation of Rohon-Beard neurons is sufficient to 
modulate the behavior of ngn1::Magneto2.0 zebrafish in the presence or absence of 
magnetic fields. We developed a magnetized behavioral testing arena formed by spacing two 
NdFeB rare earth magnets 6 mm apart (Supplementary Fig. 10b), which delivered a ten-fold 
greater magnetic field of ~500 mT to zebrafish larvae than the GCaMP assay. We 
hypothesized that even if only a few Rohon-Beard neurons were activated by Magneto2.0, 
the stereotypical escape response would nevertheless induce a coiling behavior, as 
demonstrated previously26,29. Indeed, in response to a 500 mT magnetic field, groups of 24 
to 34 hours post fertilization (hpf) ngn1::Magneto2.0 expressing zebrafish larvae coiled 
more frequently compared to those not exposed to a field (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Movies 
1–2). In contrast to ngn1::Magneto2.0 fish, which displayed an approximate ten-fold 
increase in coiling behavior upon magnetic field exposure, there was no observable change 
in this behavior for either control group—uninjected WT fish or ngn1::TRPV4-p2A-ferritin 
fish, which bicistronically express independent, unfused TRPV4 and ferritin moieties (Fig. 
3c). Consistent with in vitro findings, fish expressing the Magneto prototype channel under 
control of the β-actin promoter exhibited a response that was five-fold smaller than that of 
fish expressing Magneto 2.0 (Supplementary Fig. 9b–d). Finally, we confirmed that 
Magneto2.0 expression did not disrupt normal peripheral projections of Rohon-Beard 
neurons by examining red fluorescent protein (RFP) expression in sensory neurons of 
Tg(isl1::rfp) fish and Tg(isl1::rfp);ngn1::Magneto2.0-IRES-nlsegfp chimeric fish 
(Supplementary Fig. 10c–f). Together, these results confirm that Magneto2.0 is a viable 
candidate for remotely controlling neuronal activity and animal behavior in vivo.
Remote control of mammalian neural activity in freely behaving mice
To determine if Magneto2.0 is capable of controlling mammalian neural activity in vivo, we 
performed electrophysiology measurements in freely behaving mice transduced with an 
AAV1 carrying CMV::DIO-Magneto2.0, which expresses Magneto2.0 in a Cre-dependent 
manner. We aimed to test if Magneto2.0 is capable of rapidly activating a large nucleus deep 
within the brain, which is more challenging when using optical actuators. To this end, we 
used mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the dopamine receptor 1 promoter 
(Drd1a::Cre), which is expressed in approximately half of the medium spiny neurons 
(MSNs) of the striatum30. We then transduced striatal neurons of Drd1a::Cre mice with an 
AAV1 carrying Magneto2.0 and two weeks post-viral injection, we performed extracellular 
single-unit recordings with tetrode microdrives on Magneto2.0 expressing striatal cells in 
freely behaving mice and examined the effects of magnetic stimulation on neural firing (Fig. 
4a). For this assay, we designed a magnetized chamber (23 cm×4 cm × 18 cm) consisting of 
NdFeB magnets embedded in the chamber walls (Fig. 4b) and quantified the firing rates of 
Wheeler et al.

 striatal neurons under three conditions: (1) at baseline without magnetic stimulation, (2) 
during exposure to 50–250 mT magnetic fields within the chamber, and (3) post-magnetic 
field exposure. We classified recorded cells into two main groups based on firing rate: slow-
spiking (<5 Hz) and fast-spiking (>5 Hz) neurons with mean firing rates of 2.1±0.3 Hz 
(mean±SEM) and 8.6±0.6 Hz (mean±SEM), previously described as putative MSNs (either 
D1R+/D2R− or D1R−/D2R+) and GABAergic interneurons (D1R−), respectively31. 
Exposure of these mice to magnetic fields produced a 43.8±20.3% increase in the overall 
firing rate of slow-spiking putative MSNs (Fig. 4c–e). Importantly, the firing rate of putative 
GABAergic interneurons remained constant (Fig. 4c–d). Subsequent to magnetic 
stimulation, 66.7% of putative MSNs returned to baseline firing rates, while the putative 
interneuron firing rate again remained at baseline (Fig. 4f). Finally, we observed an increase 
in the firing rate of slow-spiking, but not fast-spiking, neurons of the striatum following 
systemic administration of the D1R agonist, SKF81297 (Supplementary Fig. 11a), 
suggesting that the D1R+ population responsive to magnetic fields are indeed slow-spiking 
neurons. Together, these data demonstrate that Magneto2.0 is capable of controlling neural 
firing in deep brain regions in response to magnetic fields.
Remote magnetogenetic control of D1R-mediated striatal reward valence
Ultimately, we sought to determine whether Magneto2.0 dependent control of neural activity 
in vivo could translate to control over complex mammalian reward behaviors regulated by 
dopamine signaling32. While optogenetic studies have implicated the dopaminergic 
signaling axis in causally mediating reward behavior33, it is unclear whether activation of 
postsynaptic D1R+ neurons is sufficient for controlling this effect. For instance, optogenetic 
stimulation of one subset of striatal D1R+ neurons is not causally responsible for induction 
of conditioned place preference (CPP)34. Conversely, studies using systemic 
pharmacological manipulations with D1R agonists confirm that activation of D1R+ neurons 
is sufficient to evoke CPP35,36, suggesting that broadly activating D1R+ neurons may cause 
reinforcing behaviors. Optogenetic techniques are intrinsically limited in the number of 
neurons that can be activated simultaneously via fiberoptic implants and pharmacological 
approaches lack genetic specificity. However, a magnetogenetic paradigm circumvents both 
obstacles simultaneously allowing resolution of this discrepancy with cell-type specificity 
and a real time behavioral output. We tested the sufficiency of D1R+ neurons in eliciting 
reward conditioning by unilaterally injecting the striata of WT and Drd1a::Cre mice with an 
AAV1 carrying CMV::DIO-Magneto2.0 and subjecting the mice to a real time place 
preference (RTPP) assay where they could choose between a magnetized arm, lined with 
eight permanent NdFeB magnets delivering a magnetic field gradient of 250–50 mT, and a 
non-magnetized arm (Fig. 5a). We observed that Magneto2.0 expressing Drd1a::Cre mice 
showed a significant preference for the magnetized arm of the RTPP chamber in contrast to 
WT mice (one-way ANOVA, p=0.0152), which exhibited no preference (Fig. 5b–e). 
Moreover, removal of the magnets from the chamber eliminated the preference of 
Magneto2.0 expressing Drd1a::Cre mice for either arm, a response identical to WT mice 
(Fig. 5c), demonstrating that RTPP is dependent on D1R stimulation. As a control, we 
measured no differences in overall locomotion between unilaterally injected WT and 
Drd1a::Cre mice using a modified open field assay (Supplementary Fig. 11b–c). These data 
show: (1) that broad activation of D1R+ neurons of the striatum is sufficient to control

 reward salience and (2) that Magneto2.0 can be used for remote control of complex 
mammalian behaviors mediated by deep brain nuclei in freely moving mice.
Discussion
In total, we have engineered and optimized a genetically encoded magnetogenetic actuator, 
Magneto2.0, and applied it to the nervous system in freely behaving animals. This is the first 
demonstration of bona fide magnetic control of the nervous system using engineered 
actuators, which we confirmed electrophysiologically and behaviorally using both zebrafish 
and mice. We have shown that Magneto2.0 remotely controls both neural firing rates and 
behavior on a rapid and physiologically relevant timescale, which is a prediction offered by 
the authors of an earlier study employing magnetogenetics to study insulin signaling13. Our 
single-component magnetogenetic system represents a significant advance in the ability to 
study neural circuits with relative ease as broad populations of genetically defined cells can 
be remotely activated in freely behaving animals. We applied Magneto2.0 to the study of 
reward behaviors to directly measure the behavioral consequences involved in remotely 
modulating large populations of cells participating in specific neural circuits37. Our findings 
also shed light on the sufficiency of D1R+ neurons to control reinforcing behaviors, which is 
consistent with the results of a recent study investigating D1R+ neuron necessity in these 
processes38. Magneto2.0 represents a new prototype for a novel class of magnetogenetic 
remote controlled actuators. While we initiated our actuator design using TRPV4 because of 
its small size and known pressure sensitivity14,39–41, Magneto suffers from the unique 
disadvantage of remaining sensitive to several endogenous stimuli known to activate 
TRPV415,16, a problem not encountered with many opto- or chemogenetic methods. Future 
studies will optimize Magneto2.0 such that it no longer responds to these stimuli and 
responds to magnetic fields only. In addition, it will be useful to understand if Magneto 
functions because of the mechanosensitive nature of TRPV4 or whether this property is 
immaterial to its magnetic activation. Continued optimization and utilization of this 
magnetogenetic actuator will position the field to better understand neural development, 
function, and pathology.

 embryo medium and staged according to hour post fertilization (hpf) or days post 
fertilization (dpf). Embryos of both sexes were used for experiments42.
Molecular biology
Molecular biology was performed using standard protocols. Plasmid DNA was purified 
using kits from Qiagen. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. 
Amplification of template DNA was performed with Phusion Flash (Life Technologies, 
F-548) and sequenced by GeneWiz. For TRPV4 S4–S5 fusion proteins, site-directed 
mutagenesis using Quickchange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis (Agilent) was performed 
on TRPV4 to introduce a unique BamHI site, into which a successive series of DNA linkers 
was inserted to gradually expand the linker region flanking TRPV4 and ferritin.
Rat TRPV4 was obtained from Addgene vector: #45751, a gift from Robert Lefkowitz. To 
generate AAV expression vectors, we modified the Addgene vector: #35507, a gift from 
Karl Deisseroth. A CMV promoter was substituted in the #35507 vector, and a small pA 
sequence was used43 to minimize size of the vector. A human ferritin H-L fusion gene was 
designed according to a previous study18 and synthesized by IDT. Other than AAV vectors, 
mammalian expression vectors were maintained in the pcDNA3.0 backbone. Fish expression 
vectors were maintained in pDestTol2CG2 and all entry vector maps are freely available 
from (http://tol2kit.genetics.utah.edu). Relevant plasmids used in this study will be deposited 
in Addgene.

Electromagnets of varying sizes and strengths were purchased from Ebay (seller ID: 
pawnnew). Permanent N42 or N52 grade NdFeB magnets were purchased from CMS 
Magnetics via www.cmsmagnetics.com or http://www.amazon.com. Gaussmeters 
(AlphaLabs, Inc.) were used to determine the field strength of electromagnets over distance 
for each experiment. For the in vivo zebrafish and mice behavioral experiments using 
permanent NdFeB magnets, an online magnetic field calculator (K&J Magnetics) or a 
Gaussmeter (AlphaLabs, Inc.) was also used.

minutes using 10% trypsin, and replated onto poly-D lysine (50 µg/mL) and laminin-coated 
(1 µg/mL) glass coverslips in fresh DMEM:F12 media (Life Technologies) containing 1 mM 
non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 10% FBS, and 1× 
penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco).

 In vitro magnetic calcium imaging
Calcium imaging was performed largely as described previously16,44. Briefly, transfected 
cells were plated onto glass coverslips, incubated overnight in a humidified incubator kept at 
37°C and 10% CO2. Cells were washed 3× with calcium imaging buffer (CIB) solution 
(105mM NaCl, 3mM KCl, 2.5mM CaCl2, 0.6mM MgCl2, 10mM HEPES, 1.2mM 
NaHCO3, 100mM mannitol, and 10mM glucose, adjusted to pH 7.45 with NaOH) and 
loaded with 3 µM Fluo-4 diluted in CIB for 30 minutes at 37°C. Cells were then washed 3× 
with CIB and de-esterified for 30–60 minutes at 37°C. Coverslips were then loaded into 
customized imaging chambers and imaged at 10× magnification for analysis. Ruthenium red 
(RR), a TRP channel pore blocker, (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 10 µM and cells 
were incubated with RR for ~2–3 minutes in the imaging chambers before imaging. For 
calcium-free media experiments, calcium in CIB was replaced with 10 mM EGTA, and cells 
were washed and incubated with calcium-free media. The TRPV4 specific antagonist, 
GSK205, was purchased from Calbiochem (616522) and used at a concentration of 10 µM. 
Cells were incubated in GSK205 for 15 minutes at 37°C before calcium imaging.
A magnetic stimulus was delivered using 3 cm electromagnets (purchased from eBay, 
sellerID: pawnnew) ruled for continuous duty, 12 VDC, 5 W, and 10 kg of pull-force. We 
situated the magnet directly above the imaging chamber during imaging. Using a 
Gaussmeter (AlphaLab Inc.), we calculated the magnetic field experienced by the cells 
(~1.25 cm away from the magnet) to be roughly 40–50 mT (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Imaging was performed by recording 30 seconds of baseline fluorescence and then turning 
on the magnet for 3–6 pulses of 10 seconds each (0.1 Hz, total time of 30–60 seconds, 90% 
duty cycle), using a standard DC powered delivery system. Coverslips were not analyzed if 
they significantly shifted during imaging.
Cells were randomly selected from an image field. Quantification was performed by 
averaging 30 seconds of baseline fluorescence measurements with no applied magnetic field 
followed by quantification of the largest three fluorescence values following magnetic 
stimulation. The three peak values were normalized to the average baseline fluorescence 
before magnetic stimulation to compute a relative fold change for each cell. Fold change was 
normalized to background by respectively scaling all values by the average fold change in 
the background (if applicable) during magnetic stimulation.
For time course analyses (Fig. 1g–h), fluorescence data for each cell was analyzed as a 
relative increase over time compared to the baseline fluorescence (30 seconds) prior to 
magnetic stimulation.
Thapsigargin calcium imaging—HEK cells were prepared for calcium imaging as 
above. Thapsigargin was purchased from Sigma (T9033) and used at a working 
concentration of 1 µM, diluted 1:1000 in CIB. A 30-second baseline of calcium fluorescence 
was recorded before direct application of 800 µL of thapsigargin into the calcium imaging 
chamber. Calcium fluorescence was recorded for 1 hour after thapsigargin addition 
(Supplementary Figure 6a).

 Magneto2.0-expressing cells were treated with thapsigargin and incubated at 37°C for 30 
minutes before calcium imaging as thapsigargin-induced calcium release remained steady at 
30 minutes after application. Cells were stimulated with magnetic fields as above: 10-second 
pulses of 50 mT field for 30 seconds of total field exposure.
Immunocytochemistry
Cells plated on coverslips were washed 3× with 1× PBS, fixed in 4% PFA for 1 hour at RT, 
washed 3× with 1× PBS, and mounted on slides with Fluoromount-G with DAPI (Southern 
BioTech). Immunocytochemistry for each iteration of trafficking signals was performed on 
two independent populations of transfected HEK293 cells.
Fish injection
AB* or Tg(isl:rfp) embryos were injected at the one-cell stage with 1–2 nL of a working 
stock of 12.5 ng/µL DNA for each construct. At 24 hpf, embryos were screened for 
cmcl2::egfp+ transgenics. Imaging of cmcl2::egfp expression was performed on every 
zebrafish embryo examined (n>50 positive fish).
Zebrafish GCaMP3 live imaging
Tg(s1020t::Gal4);Tg(UAS::GCaMP3);ngn1::Magneto2.0-p2A-mCherry expressing 
zebrafish were mounted in 0.8–2% low melting point agarose and imaged on a Leica SP5 
laser-scanning confocal microscope with a white light laser. Fish were imaged using a 40× 
objective with water immersion. After 30–60 seconds of baseline fluorescence readings, 
mounted zebrafish were stimulated by a ~50 mT magnetic field delivered by a permanent 
NdFeB rare earth magnet. The confocal pinhole was increased to 2 µm and the scan speed 
was approximately 1.3 seconds per frame. n=5 fish and n=8 stimulation experiments were 
analyzed from two independent pools of injections.
In vivo zebrafish imaging
Imaging was performed as described previously45. Briefly, a Quorum WaveFX-XI spinning 
disc confocal system (Quorum Technologies Inc.) was used, equipped with a 40× water 
objective (NA=1.1) on a motorized Zeiss AxioObserver ZI microscope. Images were 
processed with Metamorph. n=10 fish imaged per genotype.
Zebrafish behavioral tests
Injected fish were maintained on an AB* background strain. Zebrafish embryos were 
behaviorally tested between 24–34 hours post fertilization (hpf). Two 2”×0.5”×0.25” N52 
grade NdFeB permanent magnets were oriented such that one south and one north pole were 
oriented towards the fish over a fixed distance of ~1 cm. Fish were maintained in egg water 
during the course of behavioral testing and a 30 fps video was taken using an Axio 
Zoom.V16 fluorescent stereo zoom microscope. Fish were randomly selected from their 
groups for behavioral analysis. The videos were manually scored by counting the number of 
coils made by each fish over the length of the video and normalized as a rate of coiling by 
dividing the number of coils by the length of the video. Length of original behavioral 
analysis is between 2–3 minutes per video and Supplementary Movies 1–2 are shown at 8×

 speed. Fish tested had no prior history of behavioral testing. Animals were tested once each. 
Exclusion criteria for analysis consisted of stereotypy such as continuous coiling during the 
recording of the movie. Two uninjected WT animals were excluded from the analysis given 
these criteria. Behavioral testing was performed during the day at consistent times (8am–
4pm).
Zebrafish whole mount immunostaining
Zebrafish were fixed and immunostained according to the protocol described previously45. 
The antibody used was rabbit anti-GFP (Invitrogen, A-6455) at a dilution of 1:1000. The 
secondary antibody was donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 488 used at 1:600.
Stereotaxic injection
Striatum transduction—The AAV1, CMV::DIO-Magneto2.0-pA containing virus used 
in this study was produced in the University of Pennsylvania vector core. Four injections of 
1 µL of ~5×1012 titer AAV1 virus were injected unilaterally into the striata of WT and 
D1R::Cre mice using a 30G Hamilton syringe, stereotaxic alignment system (Cartesian 
Research, Inc.), and automated delivery system (World Precision Instruments) while mice 
were under 2% isoflurane anesthesia on a heating pad. Unilateral injection was performed at 
(M/L: +1.6, A/P: +0.98) relative to Bregma and four 1 µL injections were performed at 
depths of −4.75, −3.75, −2.75, and −1.75 mm over 40 minutes at a rate of 100 nL/min. After 
the final injection, the syringe remained in the brain for 10 minutes, raised 0.5 mm where it 
remained for 5 minutes, then removed. Mice were administered 3 mg/kg ketoprofen post-
injection and for 3 subsequent days and permitted to recover on a heating pad before being 
returned to their home cages.
mEC transduction—For expression of Magneto 2.0 into hippocampal and mEC neurons, 
C57Bl/6 mice (5–6 weeks old) were anesthetized with ketamine/dexmedetomidine solution 
and mounted on a stereotaxic apparatus. Anesthesia was maintained by inhaled isoflurane 
for the duration of the procedure. A small hole was opened in the skull, and a pulled glass 
micropipette was lowered to the target site (M/L: +/− 3.0, A/P: −3.0) at a depth of 2.0 mm. 
Mice were injected with an equivolume mixture of an AAV1 carrying CMV::DIO-
Magneto2.0 and an AAV9 carrying CaMKIIa::EGFP-Cre (obtained from UPenn Vector 
Core) with titers of ~5×1012 and ~1×1013 infectious units per mL, respectively. 200 nL of 
virus was injected with pressure at a rate of ~50 nL/min. After injection the micropipette 
was maintained in place for 4 min before retraction. This procedure was repeated bilaterally. 
Mice were allowed to recover for at least 4 weeks following surgery before commencement 
of electrophysiology testing.
Brain slice electrophysiology
Horizontal brain slices were prepared as previously described46. For recordings, slices were 
held in a small chamber superfused with heated (32°C) oxygenated ACSF at 3 mL/min. For 
electrophysiology experiments, transduced mouse medial entorhinal cortex neurons were 
visually identified by EGFP fluorescence using a Zeiss Axioscope microscope (Zeiss, 
Oberkochen, Germany). Action potentials were evoked using a current injection step to 300 
pA. To evoke action potentials via magnetic stimulus, a permanent NdFeB magnet (CMS

 Magnetics) was used delivering ~50 mT. The magnet was driven toward the EGFP+ neuron 
via a micromanipulator until it was approximately 1 cm from the cell. Action potential 
parameters were measured as previously described46.
Single unit recordings in vivo in freely moving mice
In vivo electrophysiology was performed largely as described previously6. HS-16 four-
tetrode microdrives (Neuralynx) were implanted in anaesthetized mice by using stereotaxic 
coordinates for the striatum described above except two injections of 1 µL each were made 
at depths of −4.75 mm and −4.25 mm within the brain; the head stage was installed at an 
initial depth of −4 mm. After 2 weeks of recovery, mice were connected to a digital Lynx 
(10S) acquisition system through an HS-16 headstage preamplifier (Neuralynx), and signals 
were amplified and filtered (600–6000Hz). Data were acquired by using Cheetah acquisition 
software (Neuralynx). Baseline putative D1R neuron firing properties were recorded for 10 
min in the non-magnetized arm of the custom-made place preference chamber, followed by 
10 min in the magnetic arm of the chamber, and then 10 min of a second baseline recording 
period. Tetrodes were lowered 50µm daily during scanning for distinct units. Offline Sorter 
software (Plexon) cluster analysis was used to isolate units. Clustered waveforms were 
subsequently analyzed with MATLAB (MathWorks). Baseline activity recordings (10 min) 
were used to identify putative D1R neurons that exhibited firing rates below 5 Hz. 
Behavioral testing was performed at consistent times daily (9am–1pm) for 2–4 weeks. One 
mouse was excluded from this analysis because it failed to yield >n=3 units.
After the completion of these three recording sessions, the mice were injected with the D1R 
agonist SKF81297 (Cayman Chemical, diluted to 3 mg/kg in saline, injected i.p.). 15 
minutes after the agonist had been administered, a final 10-minute recording period in the 
non-magnetized arm of the place preference chamber was completed. Drug injection 
experiments were performed only during a 5-day period following the triplicate recording 
procedure performed above (baseline, magnet, post-magnet). Data were not included in the 
triplicate analysis (Fig. 4) once a mouse had been injected with SKF81297. Data in 
Supplementary Fig. 11a using drug are from a single mouse.
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were perfused with 4% PFA in PBS. Brains were removed and post-fixed overnight at 
4°C followed by dehydration in 30% sucrose for 2 days at 4°C. Brains were frozen in OCT 
and sectioned on a cryostat as 30 µm sections. As free-floating sections, tissue was washed 
3× for 5 minutes with 0.3% PBS-T (Triton X-100), followed by blocking for 30 minutes in 
5% donkey serum diluted in 0.3% PBS-T. Sections were then incubated with primary 
antibody diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4°C with agitation. The next day, sections 
were washed 3× for 5 minutes with 0.3% PBS-T followed by incubation with secondary 
antibody diluted in blocking solution for 2 hours at room temperature. Sections were washed 
3× for 5 minutes in 0.3% PBS-T and mounted on slides.
Primary antibodies used in this study were: rabbit anti-TRPV4 (Santa Cruz, sc-98592) and 
rabbit anti-TRPV4 (Novus, NB110-74960). Secondary antibody used was: donkey anti-
rabbit Alexa-488 (Invitrogen) at 1:500.

 NOTE: The TRPV4 antibodies used showed significantly high background staining in WT 
and non-transduced tissue, making it difficult to distinguish between endogenous and 
virally-mediated TRPV4 expression.
Mouse behavioral testing
All testing was conducted was during the mouse light cycle at consistent times (9am–5pm).
Open field—A custom-built open-field chamber was constructed by A. Spano and M. 
Wheeler (23 cm × 23 cm), where four 10 cm diameter electromagnets fit into the floor, and 
were covered with a 0.5 cm wooden platform on which the mouse could walk. Each magnet 
was connected to an independent power supply delivering roughly 2.5A and 30V of power, 
and generating a magnetic field of roughly 150 mT. Mice were placed in the chamber for 5 
minutes and baseline recordings of locomotion were measured. Magnets were turned on for 
5 minutes to measure responses to the magnetic field. Each mouse was tested in the assay 1 
time for a total of 10 minutes per mouse.
Real time place preference (RTPP)—The two arms of the assay were custom-built by 
A. Spano and M. Wheeler (4 cm wide (internal diameter) × 23 cm long). Five permanent 
NdFeB magnets (Four 2” × 0.5” × 0.25” magnets, one 1” × 0.5” × 0.25” magnet) were 
embedded into each wall of the magnetized arm, recessed at a depth of 1 cm. Each 2”×0.5”
×0.25” magnet delivered roughly 250 mT and the magnetic field strength was roughly 50 
mT in the center of the magnetized arm. The magnets were embedded at a height range of 
between 1.1 cm to 1.6 cm above the floor of the chamber to primarily expose the mice’s 
heads to the field. Mice were placed into the chamber in the center of the two arms and 
permitted to explore for 2 minutes before recording began. The testing session lasted a total 
of 10 minutes. The two arms appeared identical except for the presence/absence of magnets.
For experiments using Magneto-transduced Drd1a::Cre mice where the magnets were 
removed from the RTPP chamber, two cohorts of 3 mice each were used. In the first cohort, 
the mice were first exposed to the magnet on Day 1, then the magnets were removed and 
preference was assessed on Day 2. In the second cohort, Drd1a::Cre mice injected with 
AAV1 CMV::DIO-Magneto2.0 were trained in the chamber lacking magnets on Day 1, then 
tested with the magnetized chamber on Day 2. The magnetized/non-magnetized arms were 
transposed for each cohort to ensure that there was no preference for either side in the 
testing chamber.
Mouse behavioral data analysis
Mouse behaviors were measured using Ethovision XT 11 (Noldus), which is an automated 
tracking, recording, and measurement software package. Following each testing session of 
open field, linear velocity was measured (nose-point relative to center-point) with and 
without magnetic field for the open field assay. For RTPP, side preference was calculated as 
the percent of time a mouse spent in the magnetized vs. non-magnetized arm. For RTPP 
experiments where mice were exposed to the chamber without any magnets installed, the 
“magnetic arm” was chosen as the side where the magnet was placed in the testing session 
and numerical values were then calculated.

 Statistical Methods
All statistical comparisons were performed using Prism 6 (GraphPad). No Omnibus 
normality test was performed for any of the data sets because sample sizes were small. Data 
were assumed to be normally distributed except in Fig. 4d, f and Supplementary Fig. 9c. 
Specific statistical tests are explicitly stated in the Figure Legends. No statistical methods 
were used to pre-determine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those generally 
employed in the field6,13,33,44,47,48. No blinding was performed for data analysis or 
behavioral testing but automated and randomized quantification was performed where 
applicable.

 Figure 1. Remote control of calcium signaling using Magneto2.0
(a–e) In vitro calcium imaging micrographs of Fluo-4-loaded HEK293 cells before and after 
3 pulses of 40–50 mT, 0.1 Hz, 90% duty cycle magnetic stimulation. (f) Quantification of 
calcium fluorescence fold change in response to the given condition. All experiments treated 
with magnetic fields except “no magnet” condition. Replicates are shown as individual 
coverslips equaling n=5 (TRPV4/ferritin), n=3 (No magnet), n=4 (Ruthenium red, (RR)), 
n=4 (Ca2+ free), n=5 (Magnet) coverslips per condition; total cells analyzed per condition 
are n=195 (TRPV4/ferritin), n=150 (No magnet), n=148 (RR), n=206 (Ca2+ free), n=396

 (Magnet) with n>30 cells analyzed per coverslip. One-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test, 
(F4,16=7.268, p=0.0016). (g) Average temporal kinetics of all cells analzyed within a single 
coverslip per condition (n=48 (TRPV4/ferritin), n=50 (No magnet), n=45 (RR), n=45 (Ca2+ 
free), n=102 (Magnet)). Horizontal bar/horseshoe indicates magnetic field application. Two-
way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test, (F4,32490=199.1, p<0.0001), *p<0.05 for all time points

 Figure 2. Electrophysiological characterization of Magneto2.0 in mouse brain slices
(a) Schematic of viral vector. ITR: inverted terminal repeats; CMV: cytomegalovirus 
promoter; P: loxP site; 2: lox2272 site. (b) EGFP immunostaining of a WT mouse brain 
slice showing areas of viral transduction. Hippocampus/entorhinal cortex was doubly 
transduced with two AAV vectors: AAV1 carrying CMV::DIO-Magneto2.0 and AAV9 
carrying CaMKIIα::Cre-EGFP. DG: dentate gyrus, sub: subiculum, EC: entorhinal cortex. 
(c) Magnetically evoked spike train of a current-clamped mEC neuron transduced with 
CaMKIIα::Cre-EGFP and CMV::DIO-Magneto2.0. Neuron was stimulated with a 50 mT 
static magnetic field delivered by a permanent magnet. The graded bar represents the 
magnetic field experienced by neurons during the initiation and cessation of magnetic 
stimulation as the permanent magnet was brought toward the brain slice using a 
micromanipulator. Magnetically evoked APs were abolished by bath application of 10 µM 
GSK205. (d) Sample trace from an EGFP+ current-clamped mEC neuron transduced with 
CaMKIIα::EGFP and CMV::DIO-Magneto2.0 and thus, not expressing Magneto2.0. No 
action potentials are elicited in response to magnetic stimulation. (e) Quantification of the 
number of spikes compared between current injection (n=14 neurons, n=5 mice) and 
magnetic stimulation (n=12 neurons, n=5 mice) for EGFP+ cells expressing Magneto2.0. No 
magnetically induced APs are observed during bath application of GSK205 (n=3 neurons, 
n=3 mice) or when Magneto2.0 is not expressed (300 pA: n=6 neurons, Magnet: n=3 
neurons, n=3 mice). All neurons examined are from a total of n=8 mice. Left panel: one-way 
ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test, (F2,26=4.301, p=0.0243). Right panel: unpaired two-tailed t-
test, (t7=13.23, p<0.0001). ***p<0.001, *p<0.05, ns: not significant. Data shown as mean
±SEM.

 Figure 3. Magnetic control over zebrafish tactile behavior in vivo
(a) Quantification of GCaMP3 fluorescence in mCherry+ Rohon-Beard sensory neurons and 
mCherry- spinal cord neurons in 48 hpf zebrafish larvae expressing ngn1::Magneto2.0-p2A-
mCherry. n=20 mCherry+, n=33 mCherry- neurons from 8 stimulation experiments using 
n=5 zebrafish from 2 independent injection cohorts. Two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test, 
(F42,2339=3.248, p<0.0001). *p<0.05 for all points from 35–55 seconds. (b) Coiling rate of 
24–36 hpf ngn1::Magneto2.0 fish. Number of independent experiments for each condition is 
n=3 (No magnet) and n=6 (Magnet). n=26 (No magnet) and n=25 (Magnet) fish were used 
in respective conditions. Unpaired two-tailed t-test, (t7=6.152, p=0.0005). (c) Fold change in 
coiling of fish genotypes aged 24–36 hpf. Number of videos analyzing baseline coiling is 
n=3 per genotype, number of magnetic stimulation experiments include n=4 (Uninjected), 
n=4 (ngn1::TRPV4-p2A-ferritin), and n=6 (ngn1::Magneto2.0). Number of fish analyzed 
shown as (baseline, magnet) for each genotype is: Uninjected: (27, 18), ngn1::TRPV4-p2A-
ferritin (17, 21), and ngn1::Magneto2.0 (26, 25). One-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test 
(F2,11=39.01, p<0.0001). Data pooled from 2 independent injection cohorts per genotype. 
***p<0.001, *p<0.05. Data shown as mean±SEM.
