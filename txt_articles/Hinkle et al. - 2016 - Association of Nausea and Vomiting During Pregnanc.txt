IMPORTANCE Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy have been associated with a reduced
risk for pregnancy loss. However, most prior studies enrolled women with clinically
recognized pregnancies, thereby missing early losses.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy with
pregnancy loss.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized clinical trial, Effects of Aspirin in
Gestation and Reproduction, enrolled women with 1 or 2 prior pregnancy losses at 4 US
clinical centers from June 15, 2007, to July 15, 2011. This secondary analysis was limited to
women with a pregnancy confirmed by positive results of a human chorionic gonadotropin
(hCG) test. Nausea symptoms were ascertained from daily preconception and pregnancy
diaries for gestational weeks 2 to 8. From weeks 12 to 36, participants completed monthly
questionnaires summarizing symptoms for the preceding 4 weeks. A week-level variable
included nausea only, nausea with vomiting, or neither.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Peri-implantation (hCG-detected pregnancy without
ultrasonographic evidence) and clinically recognized pregnancy losses.
RESULTS A total of 797 women (mean [SD] age, 28.7 [4.6] years) had an hCG-confirmed
pregnancy. Of these, 188 pregnancies (23.6%) ended in loss. At gestational week 2, 73 of 409
women (17.8%) reported nausea without vomiting and 11 of 409 women (2.7%), nausea with
vomiting. By week 8, the proportions increased to 254 of 443 women (57.3%) and 118 of 443
women (26.6%), respectively. Hazard ratios (HRs) for nausea (0.50; 95% CI, 0.32-0.80) and
nausea with vomiting (0.25; 95% CI, 0.12-0.51) were inversely associated with pregnancy
loss. The associations of nausea (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.29-1.20) and nausea with vomiting (HR,
0.51; 95% CI, 0.11-2.25) were similar for peri-implantation losses but were not statistically
significant. Nausea (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26-0.74) and nausea with vomiting (HR, 0.20; 95%
CI, 0.09-0.44) were associated with a reduced risk for clinical pregnancy loss.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among women with 1 or 2 prior pregnancy losses, nausea and
vomiting were common very early in pregnancy and were associated with a reduced risk for
pregnancy loss. These findings overcome prior analytic and design limitations and represent
the most definitive data available to date indicating the protective association of nausea and
vomiting in early pregnancy and the risk for pregnancy loss.

N
ausea with or without vomiting is reported by as many
as 80% of women during pregnancy1 and can have a
substantial negative effect on quality of life.2 Al-
though speculation commonly suggests that nausea is a good
sign and indicative of a healthy pregnancy, evidence support-
ing this assertion is limited.
Much of the published literature reports on studies that
enrolled women after a clinically recognized pregnancy,
thereby failing to include women with early pregnancy losses
or relying on participant recall of nausea and/or loss.3-8 Thus,
in the absence of prospective data, nausea and vomiting may
be no more than a sign of still being pregnant as opposed to a
signofthehealthofthepregnancy.Inaddition,mostpriorstud-
ies have not considered behavioral factors, such as stress, ex-
ercise, and caffeine intake, or fetal characteristics, such as
karyotype or the presence of a multiple gestation.
Our objectives in the present study were to describe the
naturalhistoryofnauseaandvomitingsymptomsearlyinpreg-
nancy and to evaluate the association between these symp-
toms and pregnancy loss. We examined data from a prospec-
tive preconception cohort of women who conceived and
recorded daily nausea and vomiting symptoms from gesta-
tional week 2 (ie, conception) through week 8 and monthly
thereafter.
Methods
Study Sample and Procedures
This study was a secondary ad hoc analysis of the Effects of
Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) trial, a multi-
center, block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
clinical trial that examined the effect of preconception low-
dose aspirin on pregnancy loss and live birth.9 All women were
aged 18 to 40 years, were actively trying to conceive, and had
a history of 1 or 2 pregnancy losses (n = 1228). Inclusion and
exclusion criteria have been detailed elsewhere.10 Data were
collected from June 15, 2007, to July 15, 2011. Women were fol-
lowed up for as many as 6 menstrual cycles while trying to con-
ceiveandthroughpregnancyifconceptionwassuccessful.The
present analysis was limited to women with a positive result
ofahumanchorionicgonadotropin(hCG)pregnancytest.11The
institutional review boards at the University of Haifa, Haifa,
Israel; University of Utah, Salt Lake City; and University at Buf-
falo, Buffalo, New York, approved the study, and all partici-
pants provided written informed consent.
During the preconception period, women underwent ac-
tive or passive follow-up (eFigure in the Supplement). Women
were in active follow-up during the first 2 menstrual cycles af-
ter enrollment. During active follow-up, women completed a
preconceptiondailydiary(paperbooklet),provideddailyurine
samples, used a fertility monitor (ClearBlue Easy; Iverness
Medical), and completed clinic visits in the middle and at the
end of each cycle. Women entered passive follow-up if they
did not become pregnant during the first 2 cycles. During pas-
sive follow-up, women used the fertility monitor and com-
pleted clinic visits at the end of each cycle. After an hCG-
positive pregnancy test result, women entered pregnancy
follow-up, during which a pregnancy-specific daily diary as-
sessing common pregnancy symptoms and other exposures
was completed for 4 weeks. Study ultrasonography was per-
formed during gestational week 6 or 7. We determined gesta-
tional age based on ultrasonographic findings. For partici-
pants who had a pregnancy loss before ultrasonography could
be performed, pregnancy dating was based on the first day of
the last menstrual period as recorded with the fertility moni-
tor or the preconception diary. Study clinic visits were per-
formed at weeks 8, 12, 20, and 28 and telephone contact at
weeks 16, 24, 32, and 36.
Assessment of Nausea and Vomiting
In their daily preconception and pregnancy diaries, partici-
pants rated nausea and vomiting as none, nausea only, vom-
iting once per day, or vomiting more than once per day. The
preconception diary was used to quantify nausea and vomit-
ing from gestational week 2 (ie, conception) until pregnancy
was confirmed in the clinic and the pregnancy diary was ini-
tiated. All diaries were paper forms that were completed at
home and then returned and reviewed by study coordinators
at each visit.
From gestational weeks 12 to 36, participants completed
monthly questionnaires describing their nausea and vomit-
ingsymptomsduringtheprior4weeksasfollows:never,rarely
(once per month), occasionally (2 or 3 times per month), some-
times (1 or 2 times per week), often (3-6 times per week), or
daily. Only participants who remained pregnant at the time of
the questionnaire were asked to complete the questionnaire
for the preceding 4 weeks, ensuring that all data were pro-
spectively collected before the pregnancy outcome.
For all analyses, daily diary and questionnaire data were
summarized into week-level variables. For gestational weeks
2 to 8, if a woman reported having any nausea on any given
day during that week, then we considered her to have had nau-
seaduringthatweek;otherwise,weconsideredhernottohave
had nausea. Vomiting was treated similarly. For any week with
vomiting, we also considered women to have had nausea be-
cause the state of nausea precedes vomiting. Nausea and vom-
itingsymptomsascertainedfromthemonthlypregnancyques-
tionnaire were assumed to be the same for all of the 4 weeks
during the questionnaire period.
Key Points
Question Are nausea and vomiting in pregnancy associated with
the risk for pregnancy loss?
Findings In this prospective preconception cohort of 797 women
with a pregnancy confirmed by human chorionic gonadotropin
test results, nausea and nausea with vomiting during pregnancy
were associated with a substantial reduction in the risk for
pregnancy loss.
Meaning These findings indicate a protective association of
maternal nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy with the risk for
pregnancy loss and may provide reassurance to women
experiencing these difficult symptoms in pregnancy.

Pregnancy Outcome
Pregnancies were confirmed by study ultrasonography at 6 to
7 weeks with demonstrated pregnancy signs (eg, a visible ges-
tational sac, clinical documentation of fetal cardiac activity,
orlater-stageconfirmationofpregnancy).Wecategorizedpreg-
nancy loss as peri-implantation or clinically recognized loss.11
Peri-implantation loss was defined as (1) an hCG-positive urine
pregnancy test result at home or the clinical site followed by
the absence of signs of clinical pregnancy at the study ultra-
sonography, with or without missed menses, or (2) an hCG-
positive pregnancy test result via retrospective laboratory
analysis with highly sensitive urine testing from daily first-
morning urine collected at home on the last 10 days of wom-
en’
s first and second cycle of study participation and on spot
urine samples collected at all postcycle visits, followed by the
absence of a positive pregnancy test result at home or in the
clinic. The latter identified early implantation failures. Clini-
cally recognized pregnancy losses were defined as a preg-
nancy loss after ultrasonographic confirmation. We included
ectopic pregnancies; preembryonic, embryonic, and fetal
losses; and stillbirths in our definition of clinically recog-
nized pregnancy loss. No molar pregnancies occurred in this
sample.
Statistical Analysis
Final follow-up was completed on August 25, 2012, and data
were analyzed from January 21, 2015, to March 16, 2016. We
compared bivariate descriptive statistics of maternal precon-
ception characteristics by any nausea or vomiting symptoms
using the χ2 test or Fisher exact test as appropriate. The asso-
ciation between weekly nausea and vomiting and the time to
pregnancy loss was assessed using Cox proportional hazards
regression models with time-varying covariates. We used 3 dif-
ferent models to examine peri-implantation and clinical preg-
nancy losses in aggregate, then individually. All models were
adjusted for potential confounders and independent predic-
tors of pregnancy loss.12 Time-fixed covariates included base-
line variables, such as age, race, income, student status, at-
tained educational level, employment status, marital status,
number of prior pregnancy losses, number of prior live births,
preconception body mass index calculated from measured
weight and height, exercise level, multivitamin intake, low-
dose aspirin treatment, gestational age of previous fetal loss,
andfetalvariables,includingfetalsex,karyotype,andmultiple-
fetalgestation.Time-varyingcovariatescollectedondiariesand
pregnancyquestionnaires,simultaneouslyasnauseaandvom-
iting, included stress, smoking, and caffeine and alcohol in-
take.
We identified missing data as (1) owing to participant
nonresponse and (2) missing diary data owing to study
design because nausea and vomiting were not assessed dur-
ing passive preconception follow-up. We used multiple
imputation with 50 replicates to address missing data owing
to nonresponse and included women’
s baseline characteris-
tics and relevant longitudinal data for the time-varying
covariates.13 Some women became pregnant during passive
preconception follow-up and, thus, did not provide nausea
and vomiting data for gestational weeks 2 to 4 until the
pregnancy diary was initiated; furthermore, some of these
women could have had a pregnancy loss during this period.
Our modeling strategy accounted for this left truncation,
which indicates that the outcome of interest occurs before it
can be observed in a study.14 Last, women who withdrew
from the study and had an unknown pregnancy outcome
were censored at the gestational age of their last study con-
tact. All analyses were conducted using SAS software (ver-
sion 9.4; SAS Institute Inc).
Results
A total of 797 women (mean [SD] age, 28.7 [4.6] years) had an
hCG-positive pregnancy test result. Women’
s baseline char-
acteristics are shown in Table 1. All women had at least 1 prior
pregnancy loss, with 34.3% having 2 prior losses. Most women
(446 [56.0%]) were in active follow-up at conception (first 2
menstrual cycles since enrollment). Overall, 188 pregnancies
(23.6%) ended in a loss. Of these, 55 (6.9% overall) were peri-
implantation losses and 133 (16.7% overall) were clinically rec-
ognized losses. The median gestational age at the time of loss
was 7 weeks, with 25% occurring at 5 weeks or earlier and 25%
occurring at 10 weeks or later. Ten losses occurred during pas-
sive follow-up and were therefore excluded because no expo-
sure data were collected from these women. Twelve women
withanunknownpregnancyoutcomewithdrewfromthestudy
and were censored at the time of last study contact (median,
14 weeks; interquartile range, 9-29 weeks).
The incidence of nausea and vomiting assessed with daily
diaries is shown in Figure 1. Daily diary adherence was high,
withmostwomencompletingall7daysinagivenweek.Atleast
87% of women completed the diary during gestational weeks
2 to 7. At gestational week 2, 73 of 409 women (17.8%) and 11
of 409 women (2.7%) who submitted diaries reported nausea
without and with vomiting, respectively; by week 8, the pro-
portions increased to 254 of 443 women (57.3%) and 118 of 443
women (26.6%), respectively.

women who did not have a peri-implantation pregnancy loss,

0.44 (95% CI, 0.26-0.74) and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.09-0.44),
respectively, each week for clinical pregnancy loss compared
with women with neither symptom. The unadjusted and
adjusted estimates were similar for all models.
Last, most pregnancy losses occurred during the first tri-
mester (176 of 188 women [93.6%]). As an additional analy-
sis, we limited the outcome to first trimester losses only. Re-
sults were similar with overall adjusted hazard ratios of 0.45
(95% CI, 0.28-0.72) and 0.19 (95% CI, 0.09-0.41) for the risk
for loss associated with nausea only and nausea with vomit-
ing, respectively.
Discussion
In this prospective preconception cohort of women with a his-
tory of 1 or 2 prior pregnancy losses and an hCG-confirmed
pregnancy, nausea and nausea with vomiting during preg-
nancy were associated with a substantial reduction in the risk
forpregnancyloss.Throughnovelascertainmentofdailysymp-
toms early in pregnancy from conception, our findings sug-
gest that nausea and vomiting are associated with a reduced,
albeitnonsignificant,riskforperi-implantationpregnancyloss.
Furthermore, given clinical recognition of pregnancy by
ultrasonography at 6 to 7 weeks, the presence of nausea and
vomiting were associated with a reduction in risk by more
than half for clinical pregnancy loss. These findings persist
even after accounting for rarely measured lifestyle and fetal
factors. Our study confirms prior research that nausea and
vomiting appear to be more than a sign of still being pregnant
and instead may be associated with a lower risk for preg-
nancy loss.
Nausea and nausea with vomiting were common symp-
toms, even during the earliest weeks of pregnancy. For ex-
ample, approximately 1 in 5 women reported symptoms even
before they had positive pregnancy test results. Notably, very
few preconception factors were associated with nausea and
vomiting, suggesting few modifiable risk factors. Prior retro-
spective studies that focused on the natural history of nausea
and vomiting in pregnancy1,15 reported lower levels of nausea
during the earliest weeks of pregnancy but relied on symp-
toms recalled late in the first trimester or even post partum.
Alternatively, a recent prospective study that also assessed
symptoms from weeks 2 to 7 using daily diaries16 observed
more frequent levels of symptoms. Given the retrospective na-
ture of most prior data, comparing the frequency of nausea
across populations is difficult.
Ourfindingthatnauseaandvomitingwereassociatedwith
areductionintheriskforpregnancylossisconsistentwithpub-
lished literature. In our study, nausea alone or nausea with
vomiting was associated with a 50% to 75% reduction in the
risk for pregnancy loss. Prior studies have mostly been lim-
ited to examining losses late in or after the first trimester3-5;
therefore, our clinical pregnancy loss findings are compa-
rable to those of the prior literature. These studies all simi-
larly observed a reduced pregnancy loss rate with nausea and
vomiting, but the strength of the association varied because
the timing of the retrospective collection was different across
studies. A recent analysis with prospective collection of nau-
sea and vomiting data observed that only vomiting was asso-
ciated with a reduced risk for pregnancy loss.16 This null find-
ing related to nausea may have been owing to power, with only
95 losses and nausea and vomiting symptoms that were col-
lected for only the first 5 weeks of pregnancy. Our study is
unique in that we prospectively assessed symptoms and pro-
vide data on the risk for peri-implantation and clinical preg-
nancy losses separately. Notably, almost one-third of all preg-
nancy losses were peri-implantation, meaning that the loss

From gestational weeks 12 to 36, participants completed monthly questionnaires describing their nausea and vomiting symptoms during the prior 4 weeks as never,
rarely (once per month), occasionally (2 or 3 times per month), sometimes (1 or 2 times per week), often (3-6 times per week), or daily. Only participants who
remained pregnant at the time of the questionnaire were asked to complete the questionnaire for the preceding 4 weeks, ensuring that all data were prospectively
collected before the pregnancy outcome. Week-specific sample size depends on the number of women remaining pregnant at a given week.

occurred before detection by the clinical ultrasonography at
weeks 6 to 7.17 Our findings related to peri-implantation preg-
nancy loss provide preliminary suggestion of a reduced risk
becausetheyaresimilarindirectionandmagnitudetotheclini-
cal loss findings but do not reach statistical significance. The
study was not powered to assess peri-implantation preg-
nancy loss because only a small number of cases were avail-
able, but our data provide important preliminary results that
other studies have been unable to determine because most
studies enroll women too late in gestation to assess this risk
for early loss. Thus, these findings await corroboration.
Many theories have been proposed regarding the poten-
tial mechanism for an association between nausea and vom-
iting and pregnancy loss. First, symptoms may be part of an
evolutionary advantage to change one’
s dietary intake, in-
crease consumption of carbohydrate-rich foods, or avert in-
take of potentially teratogenic substances.18,19 Our modeling
strategy accounted for smoking, alcohol and caffeine intake,
andstressateachweek,suggestingthatthemechanismislikely
not through avoidance of such substances. Second, the con-
nection between nausea and pregnancy loss may be due to ef-
fects of hCG.19,20 Although β-hCG does not necessarily corre-
late with nausea and vomiting, β-hCG levels are known to be
increased in multiple-fetal gestations and trisomy 21.21 A
unique aspect of our study was the inclusion in analytic mod-

pregnancy loss; notably, our findings related to clinical preg-
nancy loss persisted after accounting for these factors. An-
other possibility is that nausea and vomiting are markers for
viable placental tissue. Thus, less nausea and vomiting may
identify failing pregnancies, with lower hormone levels lead-
ing to nausea and vomiting.
Our study had many strengths. The systematic, prospec-
tive data collection from preconception onward provided an
advantage.Usingpreconceptiondailydiaries,weobtainedrare
dataonthenaturalhistoryofnauseaandvomitingstartingfrom
gestational week 2 (ie, conception). This approach allowed for
uniqueassessmentoftheassociationofnauseasymptomswith
peri-implantationpregnancyloss.Anadditionaladvantagewas
our accounting for the fact that women’
s symptoms were not
continuous every week and could wax and wane with inter-
mittent weeks. Most previous studies have assessed nausea
and/or vomiting as either a single variable for the entire
period3,4,6 or treated it as a continuous exposure from the date
reported that symptoms started to their end date.5 We also ac-
counted for time-varying covariates, including behavioral fac-
torsandrarelyavailablecovariates,suchaskaryotype,thathelp
to elucidate the potential biological mechanism. Last, all preg-
nancy losses, including peri-implantation losses, were thor-
oughly identified in this cohort, which may make the inci-
dence of pregnancy loss appear high compared with studies
that do not capture these early losses, but this estimate is con-
sistent with prior estimates with thoroughly ascertained
losses.22
Thestudyhadseverallimitations.First,thisstudywascon-
ducted within a rather homogeneous sample of women, which
may limit generalizability. Daily early nausea and vomiting
symptoms were not captured for women who became preg-
nant during the passive follow-up phase (ie, cycles 3-6) and did
not complete the preconception daily diary during the rel-
evant time window; however, exclusion of women who be-
came pregnant during passive study follow-up did not appre-
ciablychangeestimatesorthereportedfindings.Furthermore,
our modeling strategy accounted for this systematic exclu-
sion (ie, left truncation). Although daily diary adherence was
very high, missing data were thoroughly addressed using mul-
tiple imputation and leveraging women’
s extensive longitu-
dinaldata(eg,priorandsubsequentsymptomsandrelatedfac-
tors,suchasstressandcaffeineandalcoholintake)tooptimally
inform imputation. Also, a small proportion of women had hy-
peremesis; we were unable to assess the impact of this severe
form of nausea. Notably, the rate of hyperemesis in our study
was consistent with rates in other reports.23
Conclusions
Among women with 1 or 2 prior pregnancy losses, nausea and
nausea with vomiting during pregnancy were associated with
a 50% to 75% reduction in the risk for pregnancy loss. Nausea
and vomiting symptoms were common very early in preg-

a Model accounts for left truncation (ie, passive follow-up schedule).
bTime-varying covariates include smoking, stress, and caffeine and alcohol
intake. Time-fixed covariates include age, race, income, student status,
attained educational level, employment status, marital status, number of prior
pregnancy losses, number of prior live births, preconception body mass index,
exercise level, vitamin intake, low-dose aspirin treatment, gestational age of
previous loss, fetal sex, karyotype, and multiple-fetal gestation.

knowledge,indicatingtheprotectiveassociationofnauseaand
