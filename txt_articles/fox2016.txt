IMPORTANCE Patients’perceptions of their physician can affect subjective and objective
outcomes. Physician attire influences patients’perceptions of their physician and
consequently may affect patient outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To determine patient preferences for different types of dermatologist attire in
dermatology medical, surgical, and wound care clinics. We hypothesized that patients in the
dermatology medical setting would prefer professional attire, while patients in the
dermatology surgical and wound care setting would prefer surgical scrubs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study analyzed responses to a cross-sectional,
anonymous survey by English-speaking dermatology patients (aged 18 years or older) at
general, surgical, and wound care clinics in an academic center in Miami, Florida. Patients who
could not read and understand the survey were excluded. Participants received pictures of a
physician wearing business attire, professional attire, surgical attire, and casual attire, and
responded by indicating which physician they preferred for each of 19 questions. Frequencies
of responses were recorded, and χ2 and regression tests were performed.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Response frequencies.
RESULTS Surveys were administered to 261 persons, and 255 participated and completed
enough of the questions to be included in the outcome analyses (118 men, 121 women, 22
unknown [did not answer sex question]), mean (SD) age, 56.3 (18.6) years; about 49% of
those who reported their sex were men; 56% were Hispanic; and 85% were white.
Approximately 72% of respondents held a college degree or higher. About 63%, 24%, and
13% of respondents were medical, surgical, and wound care dermatology patients,
respectively. Roughly 73%, 19%, 6%, and 2% of cumulative responses were for professional,
surgical, business, and casual attire, respectively. Respondents who received a picture of a
black male or black female physician were more likely to exclusively prefer professional attire:
unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) 3.21 (95% CI, 1.39-7.42) and 2.78 (95% CI, 1.18-6.51),
respectively, compared with respondents who received a picture of a white male physician.
Nonwhite and unemployed respondents were less likely to prefer professional attire
exclusively: ORs, 0.28 (95% CI, 0.1-0.83) and 0.28 (95% CI 0.08-0.99), respectively.
Respondents preferred professional attire in all clinic settings, though respondents in the
dermatology surgery clinic were less likely to prefer professional attire compared with
respondents in the medical dermatology clinic: race-adjusted OR, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.56-0.98).
Wound care and medical dermatology respondents preferred professional attire comparably.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, most patients preferred professional attire for
their dermatologists in most settings. It is possible that patients’perceptions of their
physicians’knowledge and skill is influenced by the physicians’appearance, and these
perceptions may affect outcomes.

P
hysiciansandpatientsquicklydevelopanopinionabout
each other during their initial encounter. Patients (sub-
consciously or consciously) evaluate whether they like
and trust the physician, and this serves in the development
of the physician-patient relationship.1 Patients’perceptions of
their physicians affect outcome and have been linked to im-
provement (or lack thereof) in quality of life, depression, he-
moglobin A1c levels, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.2-4
Part of this perception is based on physician attire,5,6 and con-
sequently, it is possible that physician attire may affect pa-
tient outcomes.
In other medical fields, patients prefer their physicians
to wear formal attire (button-down shirt, tie, and slacks for
male physicians and blouse, skirt, or suit pants for female
physicians), with or without a white coat, but this seems to
vary geographically, by patient age, and by specific fields
within medicine.6 Three prior studies have investigated
patient preference in dermatologist attire. Thomas et al,7
used a written survey without pictures to inquire about the
importance of dermatologists’wearing a white coat with or
without a tie and found that adult respondents preferred
white coats, albeit only slightly. Similarly, most respondents
in a study by Kanzler and Gorsulowsky8 reported the white
coat as a “desirable” physical characteristic of their derma-
tologist. Maruani et al9 evaluated patients’attire preference
in a French inpatient and private-practice setting and found
patients preferred professional attire (though surgical
scrubs was not one of the investigated attire options). We
sought to elucidate patient preference in dermatologist
attire in the outpatient dermatology medical, surgical, and
wound care settings to determine what additional factors
may affect these preferences and how dermatologist attire
affects patients’ perceptions of their dermatologist. We
hypothesized that patients in the dermatology medical set-
ting would prefer the white coat, while patients in the der-
matology surgical and wound care settings would prefer
surgical scrubs.
Methods
After obtaining University of Miami (UM) institutional
review board approval, we prepared a validated,5 anony-
mous, 1-time survey to be administered to UM Miller School
of Medicine Dermatology Department patients in outpatient
general dermatology, Mohs surgery, and wound care clinics.
A copy of the survey questionnaire is provided in the
eAppendix in the Supplement. Eligible respondents were
patients (both new and follow-up patients) in a UM derma-
tology clinic, at least 18 years old, and able to complete the
English-language survey unassisted. We excluded respon-
dents who were unable to visualize the pictures or compre-
hend the survey questions. All participants provided their
written informed consent.
To make the survey better suited to dermatology, modi-
fications were made to a prior survey5 as follows: 6 ques-
tions were added, 1 deleted, and 5 were slightly modified.
These modified questions were administered to volunteers
who affirmed their clarity. Respondents in the clinic waiting
rooms were approached by investigators and invited to
complete the survey without any inducements. If respon-
dents were called to enter their examination rooms, they
completed the survey in their examination rooms. Respon-
dents were assured of the anonymity of their responses.
Each respondent was administered a survey with 1 picture
series of the 4 different attire types (Figure) selected in a
consecutive fashion. Each series featured 1 physician (white
male, white female, black male, or black female) wearing
business attire (suit and tie), professional attire (white coat
and tie), surgical attire (scrubs), and casual attire (t-shirt and
jeans)5 on a single page, so the respondent was able to view
all 4 attire types simultaneously. Each image depicted the
physician using identical lighting, background, facial
expression, hairstyle, and accessories. Respondents were
asked, of the 4 physicians (same physician wearing the 4
different attires), which would they prefer “to be their der-
matologist,” “to cut out skin cancer,” “for a dermatologic
emergency,” and other questions.
Statistical Methods
Using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 22,
we performed χ2 tests for each question to compare
responses across respondent groups such as education
level, race, and sex as well as the pictured physician’
s race
and sex. A multivariate logistic regression model was used
to determine if respondent characteristics or pictured physi-
cian characteristics influenced the respondents’exclusive
preference for the white coat for all questions. Finally, a
negative binomial regression analysis was performed
including a Wald χ2 test along with likelihood ratios to
determine significant linear associations between all
respondents’clinic location and likelihood of choosing pro-
fessional attire vs the other attire options for the sum of all
questions. Statistical significance was set at P < .05 with
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all tests. Surveys with
missing responses were included in the analysis without
imputing missing values.
Key Points
Question What are patient preferences in dermatologist attire in
the outpatient medical, surgical, and wound care settings?
Findings In this survey study of patients’attitudes about
dermatologists’attire, professional attire was preferred in all clinic
settings (73% of cumulative responses), though respondents in
the surgical dermatology setting were significantly less likely to
prefer professional attire compared with those in the medical
dermatology setting. Respondents who received a picture of a
black physician were significantly more likely to exclusively prefer
professional attire, while nonwhite and unemployed respondents
were significantly less likely to prefer professional attire.
Meaning The majority of patients prefer their dermatologist to
wear professional attire in all clinic settings, and patient and
physician characteristics have an effect on this preference.

Results
Surveys were administered to 261 persons (mean [SD] age, 56.3
[18.6] years), and 255 participated and completed enough of
the questions to be included in the outcome analyses; demo-
graphic data were reported for all 261 when available. Nearly
half of respondents who reported their sex (49.4%, n = 118)
were men; 55.5% (n = 142) were Hispanic; and 85.4% (n = 211)
were white. Nearly three-quarters of respondents (72.1%,
n = 186) had a college degree or higher; 86.2% (n = 219) were
employed full-time or part-time or retired; and 55.6% (n = 140)
were married. About three-fifths of respondents (62.6%,
n = 154)weremedicaldermatologypatients,24%(n = 59)were
surgical dermatology patients; and 13.4% (n = 33) were der-
matology wound care patients (Table 1).
The rate of participation was greater than 95%. Only 3 sur-
veys (1.1%) were returned nearly entirely incomplete and were
excluded. In addition, 3 respondents refused to participate, 1
because he believed the project was not important, and 2 be-
causetheywere“notinterested.

ber of respondents who were excluded owing to inadequate
proficiency with the English language because they were ex-
cluded based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Respondents overwhelmingly preferred professional
attire across all clinic settings (Table 2). Of all responses,
73% preferred professional attire, 19% preferred surgical
attire, 6% preferred business attire, and 2% preferred casual
attire. The query “which would you prefer for a dermato-
logic emergency?” was the only case for which respondents
preferred surgical attire more often than professional attire:
49% vs 47% (Table 3).

respondents in the clinic for dermatologic surgery still pre-
ferred, but were significantly less likely to choose, profes-
sional attire compared with respondents in the clinic for medi-
cal dermatology (OR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.56-0.98]). Race did not
affect preference in wound care respondents (OR, 0.99 [95%
CI, 0.69-1.42]).
Discussion
Across wound care, surgical, and medical dermatology clin-
ics, respondents largely preferred professional attire. Unem-
ployed respondents and nonwhites were less likely to prefer
professional attire for all questions, while respondents who
received a picture of black male or black female physician
were more likely to prefer professional attire for all ques-
tions. Furthermore, surgical dermatology clinic respondents
still preferred professional attire but were significantly less
likely to prefer professional attire compared with medical
dermatology respondents. Wound care respondents demon-
strated preferences comparable to those of medical derma-
tology respondents.
Our finding of patients’marked overall preference for
professional attire is similar to findings in other attire
studies.5,6 Interestingly, in the study by Rehman et al,5 the
study participants were less well educated than in the pre-
sent study; most had received less than a high school educa-
tion. In contrast, most of the respondents in our study were
college graduates or beyond. Nonetheless, Rehman et al5
found a similar overwhelming patient preference for profes-
sional attire. This is consistent with our findings that respon-
dent education was not associated with a particular attire
preference. In contrast, we found that nonwhite respon-
dents were significantly less likely to choose professional
attire for all questions, while Rehman et al found that black
respondents were more likely to prefer professional attire for
all questions. Rehman et al5 conducted their study in a Vet-
eran’
s Affairs internal medicine clinic in South Carolina, and
the respondents’ military background and/or differing
geographic, cultural, and social influences may explain this
discrepancy in attire preference. Similarly, in our study,
geographic, cultural, and social influences may have
contributed to perception of appropriate attire for black
physicians.
In the dermatologic setting, Thomas et al7 also found that
respondentagewasnotsignificantlyassociatedwithattirepref-
erence, and most of the respondents in their adult dermatol-
ogy clinics (55%) preferred their dermatologist to wear a white
coat. Likewise, Marauni et al9 found that their adult respon-
dents favored the white coat and most highly ranked their con-
fidence in physicians wearing the white coat, consistent with
our findings that respondents were most confident in physi-
cians wearing professional attire. Kanzler and Gorsulowsky8
studiedavarietyofphysicalcharacteristicsandfoundthatmost
of their respondents reported the white coat as a desirable
physical characteristic. Other desirable characteristics in-
cludeddisplayinganamebadgeandwearingdressshoes,while
wearing sandals, jeans, and earrings (male physicians only)
were all undesirable characteristics. Although patients seem
to prefer their dermatologist to wear a white coat, 77% of der-
matologists do not wear white coats when pictured on their
practice website.10
Professional attire was favored in all 3 clinic settings. We
found that respondents in the clinic for surgical dermatology
were less likely to choose professional attire compared with
respondents in the clinic for medical dermatology. Moreover,

notably higher than that of nearly all other questions. This sug-
gests in surgical and emergency dermatologic settings, pa-
tients prefer either professional or surgical attire. Perhaps pa-
tients associate physicians wearing scrubs with emergency
situations based on their own observations in emergency de-
partments or what they have seen on television.
Contrary to our hypothesis, respondents preferred pro-
fessional attire over scrubs in the surgical clinic. It is possible
that patients do not view cutaneous surgery as they do gen-
eral surgery, at least pertaining to the need for scrubs (and pos-
siblesterility).Infact,thisperceptionmaybeaccurate:inaran-
domized clinical trial, it was found that “newly cleaned
physician uniforms and infrequently washed white coats have
similar rates of bacterial contamination after an 8-hour
workday.”11(p177)
Another unexpected finding was that respondents in the
wound care clinic exhibited attire preferences more similar to
medical dermatology respondents than to surgical dermatol-
ogy respondents, even though wound care patients often un-
dergo surgical procedures such as debridement, grafting, and
dressing changes. In regard to attire, patients seemed to view
their wound care dermatologist as more similar to a medical
dermatologist than to a surgical dermatologist.
Notably, a common sentiment that respondents ex-
pressed to the study investigators was that they did not judge
their physicians by their attire, but rather by their knowledge
and skill. This may be the case consciously, though it is pos-
sible that patients’perceptions of their physicians’knowl-
edge and skill is influenced by the physicians’appearance: we
found that respondents consistently believed that the physi-
cian wearing professional attire would be more knowledge-
able and competent that the physician wearing the other types
of attire, and would have superior diagnostic and treatment
abilities.

Our study is limited in that survey questions modified or
added to make the survey relevant to dermatology were not
validated. More surveys were distributed to medical derma-
tology patients than to surgical and wound care dermatology
patients, though the data was sufficiently robust to allow for
our analysis. While multiple investigators distributed the sur-
veys, survey instructions were simple and clearly printed on
the front page of each survey, which allowed for respondents
to complete the survey without asking the investigators any
questions. By limiting the survey to English language only,
there was some selection bias, as monolingual Spanish-
speaking patients were excluded. This contributed to the ma-
jority of the respondents being white and college educated,
which may limit the generalizability of the study.
With any survey study, there is a possibility of response
bias, such as social desirability bias possibly resulting from the
investigator’
s attire or the respondent’
s actual physician’
s at-
tire,whichmayinfluencetherespondent’
schoices,despitethe
fact that it was emphasized to each respondent that the sur-
vey was completely anonymous.
Our study was conducted in 3 clinics at 1 university aca-
demic medical center in Miami, and it is possible that pa-
tients’attire preferences vary geographically, culturally, and
socioeconomically.6 Future studies could enroll more respon-
dents of varied ethnic, education and socioeconomic strata in
multiple medical centers to more broadly evaluate dermatol-
ogy patients’attire preference. Moreover, other attire permu-
tationscouldbeassessed(eg,poloshirtandslacksvswhitecoat
with scrubs vs white coat with shirt and tie vs white coat with
shirt without a tie). Finally, future investigations could con-
trol for whether the respondent is a new or prior patient and
whether the respondent completed the survey prior to, or af-
ter seeing the dermatologist.
Conclusions
In sum, we found that patient and physician characteristics as
well as clinic setting all affect patient preference in derma-
tologist attire. Nonetheless, professional attire is the predomi-
nantly preferred option for dermatologists in the medical, sur-
gical, and wound care setting. Future research is needed to
define regional, geographic, social, and cultural perceptions
of professional attire in other populations.
