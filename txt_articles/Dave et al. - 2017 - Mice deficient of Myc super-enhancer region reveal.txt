Abstract The gene desert upstream of the MYC oncogene on chromosome 8q24 contains
susceptibility loci for several major forms of human cancer. The region shows high conservation
between human and mouse and contains multiple MYC enhancers that are activated in tumor cells.
However, the role of this region in normal development has not been addressed. Here we show
that a 538 kb deletion of the entire MYC upstream super-enhancer region in mice results in 50% to
80% decrease in Myc expression in multiple tissues. The mice are viable and show no overt
phenotype. However, they are resistant to tumorigenesis, and most normal cells isolated from
them grow slowly in culture. These results reveal that only cells whose MYC activity is increased by
serum or oncogenic driver mutations depend on the 8q24 super-enhancer region, and indicate that
targeting the activity of this element is a promising strategy of cancer chemoprevention and
therapy.

Introduction
Deregulated expression of the MYC oncogene is associated with many cancer types (Reviewed in
Albihn et al., 2010; Dang, 2012; Evan, 2012). MYC acts primarily as a transcriptional activator that
increases expression of many genes required for RNA and protein synthesis above the level that is
required in resting cells. In cancer cells, aberrantly elevated levels of MYC drive global amplification
of transcription rates, providing the cells with necessary resources for rapid proliferation (see, for
example Brown et al., 2008; van Riggelen et al., 2010; Ji et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2012;
Sabo
` et al., 2014; Walz et al., 2014).
Transcription of the MYC gene is regulated by a diverse array of regulatory elements located
both upstream and downstream of the MYC transcription start site (TSS). Variants in the MYC
upstream region contribute to inherited susceptibility to most major forms of human cancer, and
account for a very large number of cancer cases at the population level (Amundadottir et al., 2006;
Gudmundsson et al., 2007; Yeager et al., 2007; Al Olama et al., 2009; Yeager et al., 2009). For
example, the polymorphism rs6983267 linked to colorectal (Tomlinson et al., 2007) and prostate
(Yeager et al., 2007) cancers contributes more to cancer morbidity and mortality than any other

 known inherited variant or mutation, including the inherited mutations in classic tumor suppressors
such as RB, TP53 and APC. Through computational and experimental analyses, we and others have
shown that the risk allele G of rs6983267 creates a strong binding site for the colorectal-cancer asso-
ciated transcription factor Tcf7l2 (Pomerantz et al., 2009; Tuupanen et al., 2009). This binding site
is located within the Myc-335 enhancer element that is dispensable for mouse viability, but required
for efficient Tcf7l2-driven intestinal tumorigenesis (Sur et al., 2012b).
More recently, another enhancer element, located 1.47 Mb downstream of Myc was shown to be
required for formation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in mice (Herranz et al., 2014). How-
ever, in contrast to the Myc-335 element, this element is also required for normal T-cell develop-
ment. Thus, the mechanism by which individual Myc enhancer elements contribute to normal
development and tumorigenesis is still unclear.
Several studies have shown that the 8q24 region contains a large number of additional enhancer
elements (see, for example [Hallikas et al., 2006; Ahmadiyeh et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2013;
Yao et al., 2014]) and super-enhancers that are active in many different types of human cancer
(Hnisz et al., 2013; Love
´n et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2015). The MYC-associated super-enhancers
are activated during the process of tumorigenesis (Hnisz et al., 2013), and downregulation of super-
enhancer activity leads to selective inhibition of MYC expression (Love
´n et al., 2013). Thus, MYC-
associated super-enhancer activity is required for tumorigenesis, but the role of these elements in
normal tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis has been unclear.
To address this problem, we have in this work generated multiple mouse strains deficient of regu-
latory elements upstream of the Myc promoter. Since this region contains multiple tumor type and
tissue -specific enhancers and super-enhancers, for the sake of clarity we refer to the deleted region
here as the ‘super-enhancer region´. By analysis of the mice, we found that the entire super-enhancer
eLife digest Our cells each contain close to 20,000 genes, which provide the instructions
needed to build our bodies and keep us alive. At any one time in the life of the cell, only some of
these genes are active. The activity of each gene is constantly regulated to allow the cell to respond
to changes in its environment. Enhancers are sections of DNA, outside of the genes, that act as
molecular switches controlling the activity of genes. A gene can have many such enhancers; each
enhancer is linked to a particular set of signals and having multiple enhancers allows the same gene
to be activated by different signals in different tissues in the body.
Changes to enhancers can have serious consequences. By altering the activity of genes, an
enhancer can have widespread effects on the health and behavior of a cell, including transforming it
from healthy to cancerous. The small differences in enhancers also make some people more
susceptible to cancers than others. If we can identify enhancers whose activity is commonly altered
in cancers, it could be possible to target them through treatment. Yet, it is not clear whether
targeting enhancers in this way could be effectively used to treat cancer without damaging healthy
cells.
Now, Dave, Sur et al. have examined a large enhancer region with known links to several
different cancers – including prostate, breast and colon cancers – to uncover whether it also plays a
critical role in healthy cells and if it could be safely targeted for treatment. The region has multiple
enhancers for a cancer-linked gene called MYC and is implicated in many cancer-associated deaths
every year. This particular enhancer region is found in both humans and mice, which share many
genes in common. Using genetic engineering, Dave, Sur et al. removed this enhancer region from
the genetic information of a group of mice. The experiment showed that mice without the enhancer
region were completely healthy. Also, when tested for cancer development, these mice were much
less susceptible to several major types of cancer.
This investigation reveals that it may be possible to create drugs to shut down or inhibit certain
enhancers to prevent or treat cancer without damaging healthy cells. However, this is currently just
one example in mice under laboratory conditions. Further research is needed to determine if a
similar approach can be developed to treat patients in the clinic.

 region conferring multi-cancer susceptibility contributes to MYC expression in vivo, yet is not
required for mouse embryonic development and viability. However, this region is required for the
growth of normal cells in culture and cancer cells in vivo. As cultured cells are exposed to serum,
which is a signal of tissue damage, this finding suggests that tumor cells and cells responding to
damage signals share regulatory mechanisms that are dispensable for normal physiological growth
control.
Results
Functional mapping of the super-enhancer region upstream of Myc
To dissect functional significance of the 8q24 region during normal development, we generated
series of Myc alleles in mice using homologous recombination in ES cells. These include the Myc-335
enhancer deletion allele we have described previously (Sur et al., 2012b), and deletions of two addi-
tional conserved enhancer elements, Myc-196 and Myc-540, both of which are active in mouse intes-
tine and colorectal cancer cells. In addition, we generated a point mutation that inactivates a
conserved CCCTC-Binding factor (CTCF) site 2 kb upstream of the Myc TSS. This site has previously
been reported to be required for MYC expression (Gombert and Krumm, 2009), and to have insula-
tor activity (Gombert et al., 2003) (Figure 1a). Each allele contained loxP site(s) in the same orienta-
tion to allow conditional knockouts of the enhancers, and to facilitate generation of large deletions
and duplications by interallelic recombination (Wu et al., 2007). All alleles were bred to homozygos-
ity, and resulted in generation of viable mice. Expression of Myc in the colon of Myc-196�/� and
Myc-540�/� mice was not markedly altered, suggesting that these elements have little effect on reg-
ulation of Myc in the intestine under normal laboratory conditions (Figure 1b). Myc expression level
was also normal in Myc-CTCFmut/mut mouse colon despite loss of CTCF and cohesin (Rad21) binding
to the region proximal to the Myc promoter (Figure 1c).
Mice lacking the Myc super-enhancer region are viable and fertile
As the individual mutations and deletions had limited effect, we next decided to generate two large
deletions in the Myc locus using interallelic recombination between the Myc-CTCFmut loxP site and
the loxP sites at Myc-335� and Myc-540�, yielding deletions of 365 kb (GRCm38/mm10
chr15:61618287–61983375) and 538 kb (chr15:61445326–61983375), respectively (Figure 2a). The
resulting alleles, Myc42-367 and Myc42–540, were then segregated out from the corresponding dupli-
cations, and bred to homozygosity. Given the very large regions that were deleted (Figure 2b), we
expected to see a strong phenotype. However, no overt phenotype was identified in the Myc42-367/
42-367 mice. The mice were born at the expected mendelian ratio, and both males and females were
viable and fertile. Analysis of Myc expression, however, revealed a strong decrease in Myc expres-
sion in the colon and ileum of the mice (not shown).
The larger deletion, Myc42–540, could also be bred to homozygosity, and both males and females
were viable. Given that the entire Myc regulatory region spans more than 2 Mb of DNA and is
located on both sides of the Myc coding region (Rosenbloom et al., 2013; Sloan et al., 2016), the
deletion is not expected to be equivalent to deletion of the Myc gene itself. Still, the viability of the
mice is striking, since the region deleted contains regions linked to risk for myeloma, chronic lym-
phocytic leukemia and pancreatic, thyroid, bladder, prostate, breast, and colon cancers (Chung and
Chanock, 2011; Sahasrabudhe et al., 2015; Mitchell et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016). To charac-
terize the mice further, we analyzed histology and MYC expression in the tissues where these tumors
originate from. This analysis revealed normal morphology of mammary gland, spleen, bladder, pros-
tate and colon in Myc42–540/42–540 mice (Figure 2c).
Loss of the super-enhancer region leads to tissue-specific changes in
Myc expression
Although the Myc42–540/42–540 mice exhibited a normal phenotype, Myc expression was altered in a
tissue-specific manner in these mice. This is expected since this region contains individual tissue spe-
cific regulatory elements. The expression of Myc was strongly decreased in colon, small intestine
and prostate of these mice (Figure 3a and not shown). Immunohistochemical analysis of MYC
expression in intestine revealed strong decrease of nuclear staining, and loss of MYC expression

Figure 1. Cancer susceptibility region upstream of Myc contains several conserved enhancer elements that are dispensable for normal mouse
development and MYC expression. (a) Comparison of Myc locus between human and mouse. The susceptibility regions for prostate cancer (PrCa),
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), breast cancer (BrCa), colorectal cancer (CRC) and bladder cancer (BlCa) are marked. Red vertical lines mark the
location of the Tcf7l2-binding CRC Myc enhancers in the two species. The lower panel shows the regional conservation probability predicted by
PhastCons (hg19 assembly, UCSC) with non-overlapping sliding windows for the whole region and each enhancer locus with a size of 500 bp and 10 bp,
respectively. (b) Deletion of Myc-196 and Myc-540 enhancer elements does not affect Myc expression in the colon as determined by qPCR analysis
(Myc-196�/� n = 2, Myc-540�/� n = 3 and wild-type n = 5). See Figure 1—source data 1 for details. (c) Mutation of the Myc-CTCF site causes loss of
CTCF and Rad21 binding at the Myc locus (top panel). Binding of CTCF and Rad21 at a control Actb locus is not affected. Red and black arrowheads
denote binding sites at Myc and Actb loci, respectively; green: Myc-CTCFmut/mut, blue: wild-type. The gene body for Myc and Actb is shown below the
respective panels. The qPCR analysis reveals that despite loss of CTCF/cohesin binding, the expression of Myc mRNA is not altered in the colon (for
qPCR, Myc-CTCFmut/mut n = 4, wild-type n = 3). See Figure 1—source data 1 for details. Error bars denote one standard deviation.

base of the crypt in the region where the intestinal stem cells are known to reside (Figure 3b). These

 compartment, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the proliferation marker Ki-67. Both
the wild-type and Myc42–540/42–540 had similar proliferative activity in the intestinal crypts
(Figure 3b).
In contrast to colon and prostate, Myc expression was not markedly affected in the bladder, and
was elevated in the spleen (Figure 3a). To analyze the cellular composition of the spleen, we per-
formed flow cytometric analysis of markers for hematopoietic stem cells and lymphoid lineage cells.
Myc42–540/42–540 mice had a near normal hematopoietic compartment (Figure 2d). The only
observed difference was a small reduction of B cells in the Myc42–540/42–540 mice compared to the
wild-type mice both in the spleen and the bone marrow. In contrast to the decrease in B-cells, the T
cell numbers were not affected by the deletion (Figure 2—figure supplement 1a). This finding is
consistent with the published data that regulatory elements controlling T-cell development and
T-cell
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia
are
located
1.47
Mb
downstream
of
the
Myc
ORF
(Herranz et al., 2014).
To identify regulatory elements that could explain the effect in B-cells, we performed ChIP-seq
analysis of chromatin from LSK-Flt3neg hematopoietic stem cells and mature B-cells isolated from
wild-type mice. This analysis identified two B-cell specific regulatory elements. The Myc 2–540 dele-
tion results in loss of one of the elements, and moves the other element very close to the Myc TSS
(Figure 2—figure supplement 1b). Although the exact regulatory mechanism is not clear and
requires further study, the above data is consistent with a role of the super-enhancer region in devel-
opment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which is primarily a B-cell malignancy. However, the
decrease in B-cell number does not affect viability, and the Myc42–540/42–540 mice are healthy and
do not display an immune-deficient phenotype under normal ‘clean’ mouse housing conditions in
the absence of known pathogenic microorganisms.
To compare the role of the 8q24 super-enhancer region in growth of cells in vivo and in cell cul-
ture, we isolated fibroblasts from the skin of adult Myc42–540/42–540 and wild-type mice. Based on
presence of active histone marks, and undermethylation of focal elements, the super-enhancer
region is active in fibroblasts from both humans and mice (Figure 4a and Figure 4—figure supple-
ment 1). However, the resident fibroblasts in the skin of Myc42–540/42–540 mice appeared normal as
judged by Vimentin expression (Figure 4b). Ki-67 staining (IHC) of skin sections showed comparable
proliferation levels in wild-type and Myc42–540/42–540 mice (Figure 4b). In contrast, most lines of
fibroblasts (6 out of 7) isolated from Myc42–540/42–540 mice grew slower in culture compared to fibro-
blasts isolated from wild-type mice (Figure 4c; p-value=0.0256, Mann-Whitney one tailed test).
Deletion of the Myc super-enhancer region affects MYC target gene
expression only under culture conditions
To understand the mechanism by which the deletion of the 8q24 super-enhancer region has a differ-
ential effect on growth during normal tissue homeostasis and growth under culture conditions, we
subjected both the mouse tissues and cultured cells to RNA-seq analysis. Analysis of mouse tissues
confirmed the changes in Myc expression observed by qPCR (Figure 5a and Figure 5—figure sup-
plement 1). Surprisingly, despite more than 80% decrease of Myc expression in the colon, very few
genes were downregulated in the tissues, and none of the significantly altered genes were known
MYC targets (Supplementary file 1). These results suggest that expression of canonical MYC target
genes is not sensitive to decreases in MYC protein level during normal tissue homeostasis. In con-
trast to the in vivo situation, where Myc is downregulated but key target genes are not affected, in
cultured Myc42–540/42–540 fibroblasts that grew slowly in culture, the downregulation of Myc lead to
a loss of expression of key target genes that drive cell growth and division. Upstream regulator anal-
ysis performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that the highest-ranked potential regulator
for the identified gene set was MYC (Figure 5b).
Measured by FPKM values, the cultured wild-type fibroblasts had higher Myc mRNA levels than
normal tissues, whereas the cultured null fibroblasts had Myc levels that were comparable to or
lower than those of normal wild-type tissues. The elevated Myc levels in cultured cells are caused by
serum stimulation, as Myc mRNA levels are low in serum-starved fibroblasts and strongly induced by
serum (Ref. [Dean et al., 1986] and our unpublished data). These results indicate that the 8q24
super-enhancer region is dispensable for normal tissue homeostasis under conditions where MYC
activity is relatively low. However, the region is required for induction of MYC activity to levels that

 are high enough to drive the expression of MYC target genes above their basal levels during patho-
logical growth.
The Myc super-enhancer region is required for tumorigenesis in mice
We have shown earlier that deletion of a 1.7 kb Myc-335 enhancer sequence located at the 8q24
super-enhancer region is required for intestinal tumorigenesis in mice (Sur et al., 2012b). As the
super-enhancer region deleted in Myc42–540/42–540 mice carries risk also for other cancer types,
including breast and bladder cancer, we tested the susceptibility of the Myc42–540/42–540 mice to
carcinogen induced bladder and mammary tumorigenesis. The Myc42–540/42–540 mice were not resis-
tant to N-Butyl-N(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN) induced bladder tumors. Both wild-type (n = 8)

 and Myc42–540/42–540 (n = 8) mice developed urothelial changes ranging from hyperplasia to high
grade invasive urothelial carcinoma after 5 months of BBN treatment. In contrast, comparison of
median tumor-free survival times of wild-type and Myc42–540/42–540 mice exposed to mammary-
tumor inducing dimethylbenz[a]anthracene/ medroxypregesterone (DMBA/MPA) regimen revealed
that the Myc42–540/42–540 mice were partially resistant to mammary tumorigenesis (Figure 6a). The
median tumor-free survival time for the wild-type and Myc42–540/42–540 mice was 88 and >120 days,
respectively. Although we cannot pinpoint the specific regions that contribute to breast tumorigene-
sis by analysis of the Myc42–540/42–540 mice, our work is consistent with the presence of a breast can-
cer susceptibility locus in humans at a region syntenic to the deletion. The region is distinct from the
colon cancer susceptibility locus that harbors Myc-335.
To determine whether additional elements outside of the Myc-335 region are playing a role in
tumorigenesis, we crossed the Myc42–540/42–540 mice with the Apcmin mouse that is susceptible to
intestinal tumors. The Myc42–540/42–540 mice had fewer polyps than the Myc-335�/� mice in the

 Apcmin background. In this study the wild-type mice had on an average 56 polyps at around 4
months of age (n = 5) when they had to be euthanized for ethical reasons similar to what we
reported previously. The Apcmin; Myc42–540/42–540 looked healthy and had on an average 2.4 polyps
even at 6 months of age (n = 5) compared to an average of 14.33 polyps reported for the Apcmin;
Myc-335�/� null mice at 4 months of age (Figure 6b). Together with our earlier findings, these
results indicate that loss of the 8q24 super-enhancer region makes mice resistant to both genetically
and chemically induced tumors.
We further tested the requirement of this region for the proliferation of cancer cell lines in cul-
tures. We found that the corresponding region (hg19: chr8:128226490–128746456) was also
required for GP5d colon cancer cell growth, as indicated by progressive loss of cells bearing a
CRISPR/Cas9 induced deletion of the region during co-culture with unedited cells in the population
(Figure 6c).

 Discussion
The region around the MYC gene carries inherited risk towards multiple major forms of cancer. On
aggregate, this region contributes more to inherited cancer than any other locus in the human
genome. The risk alleles for different cancer types are located in multiple distinct linkage disequilib-
rium blocks, indicating that different variants contribute to different cancer types. Several of these
regions
containing
risk
variants
have
been
implicated
in
regulation
of

expression
(Hallikas et al., 2006; Sur et al., 2012b; Herranz et al., 2014; Uslu et al., 2014), suggesting that a
large number of enhancers within this region can drive tumorigenesis. Some of the identified ele-
ments have also been shown to have roles in normal development (Herranz et al., 2014; Uslu et al.,
2014).
To study the role of the 8q24 region more systematically, we have in this work deleted several
individual enhancer elements, and also analyzed the effect of larger deletions on normal develop-
ment and carcinogenesis in mice. Our analysis of mice lacking a 538 kb region upstream of the Myc
gene suggests that enhancer elements within this region cooperatively enhance Myc expression.
Deletion of individual enhancers in this region has only a weak (Sur et al., 2012b) or no effect on
Myc expression in the mouse intestine in contrast to the deletion of the entire super-enhancer
region, which leads to severe decrease in Myc expression in multiple tissues.
MYC deficient mouse embryos die due to placental defect at E9.5. The embryos are also smaller
in size than wild-type embryos (Davis et al., 1993). However, when Myc is deleted only in the epi-
blast, the embryos grow normally and survive until E11.5, when they die due to defects in hemato-
poiesis (Dubois et al., 2008). None of these defects are observed in mice homozygous for the
deletion of super-enhancer region. The 8q24 super-enhancer region is thus dispensable for MYC
function both in the placenta and during early hematopoiesis. In our mouse colony, the super-
enhancer region deficient mice also do not display the size or weight differences reported for Myc
heterozygous mice that have a 50% reduction in MYC activity (Trumpp et al., 2001). These results
indicate that tissue-specific enhancers that reside outside of the deleted regions drive sufficient
MYC expression in the tissues that contribute to the phenotypes observed in Myc+/� and Myc�/�
mice. Consistently with this, several hematopoietic enhancers have been identified in the region 3’
of the MYC ORF (Hnisz et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2013; Herranz et al., 2014).
Myc
heterozygous
mice
also
display
increased
longevity
and

healthspan
(Hofmann et al., 2015). Although the deletion of the super-enhancer region that contains tissue-
specific enhancers regulating MYC expression is not equivalent to a heterozygous deletion of the
Myc gene in the whole body, the Myc42–540/42–540 mice could be an interesting model for identifica-
tion of the tissues that contribute to the longevity phenotype.
Despite decreased levels of MYC in multiple adult tissues, the mice lacking the super-enhancer
region are viable, fertile and display normal tissue morphology in all the tissues we investigated.
They display no overt phenotype and do not have marked defects in cell proliferation. The mice are,
however, resistant to intestinal tumorigenesis, and DMBA-induced mammary tumors, indicating that
this region is important for tumorigenesis also in mice. Our data thus shows that despite the central
role of this region in tumorigenesis (Sur et al., 2012b; Love
´n et al., 2013), it is dispensable for nor-
mal tissue development and homeostasis under laboratory conditions. Whereas this result may
appear very surprising, it is consistent with the original identification of this region using genome-
wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS has a high power to identify common variants, and most
variants that are common have only a limited effect on physiological functions. This is because a vari-
ant that has strong positive or negative effect is rapidly fixed or lost, respectively. Thus, GWAS are
specifically biased to find variants that have a relatively large effect on disease, but a small effect on
fitness.
Most genes in mammals do not have haploinsufficient phenotypes. Such buffering could be due
to mechanisms that maintain constant expression level irrespective of gene dose. However, a simpler
buffering mechanism involves either expressing a gene at a very low level where it has no effect, or
at a high level where it can contribute its functions even if its expression level is decreased due to
transcriptional noise or loss-of-function of one allele. A similar two state mechanism where physio-
logical transcription factor (TF) activity levels in the relevant cell types are either too low to drive any
target genes (off state), or high enough to activate all important targets (on state) could also mecha-
nistically explain why most heterozygous null mutations of TF genes have no apparent phenotype.

Figure 7. Model showing the activity of the Myc super-enhancer region during normal homeostasis (left) and cancer (right). During normal tissue
homeostasis (left), Myc enhancers are not strongly active, and MYC activity is relatively low. The MYC expression level is insufficient to recruit enough
MAX proteins to MYC/MAX heterodimers to drive strong induction of the MYC target genes, which instead remain under the control of basal
transcription factors (BTF). Under conditions of normal rapid proliferation as seen during embryonic development or during pathological insults in the

 Our analysis of the role of MYC in normal colon is consistent with such a simple buffering model (Fig-
ure 7). However, it should be noted that this buffering mechanism does not operate in all tissues
and under all conditions. For example, Myc gene dose has effects on mouse size, longevity and
hematopoiesis (Davis et al., 1993; Trumpp et al., 2001; Dubois et al., 2008; Hofmann et al.,
2015). In addition, the level of expression of the Myc gene has quantitative effects on cell prolifera-
tion under pathological conditions such as activation of T-cells (Heinzel et al., 2017). These results
indicate that in some situations, MYC is expressed at a level where cell growth responds linearly to
small changes in MYC levels (Figure 7, middle panel). However, the lack of an overt phenotype in
our model under normal physiological conditions in the absence of infection or tissue damage sug-
gests that growth during normal tissue homeostasis in at least some adult tissues does not linearly
respond to changes in MYC levels. The lack of an overt phenotype should not, however, be taken to
mean that the mice have no phenotype at all. As the super-enhancer region contains several highly
conserved DNA segments, and affects cell growth in culture, we expect that it will also affect
responses to tissue damage or some other perturbation that we have not investigated here. There-
fore, further studies are needed to determine the role of the super-enhancer region in various
chronic and acute models of injury and infection.
Based on our data and the earlier literature we propose that under normal physiological condi-
tions in the intestine, the Myc gene regulatory system is in the off state, and a basal level of expres-
sion of the MYC target genes is maintained by a MYC-independent mechanism. The target genes
are thus only sensitive to an increase in MYC levels. Consistently, an 80% decrease of Myc mRNA
expression does not lead to a proliferation defect, or major changes in expression of known MYC
target genes. In contrast, in tumors the system is locked to an on state, where MYC targets are
driven to a maximal level by MYC, and the targets are now only sensitive to a decrease in MYC activ-
ity (Figure 7).
The requirement of MYC in tumor cells appears absolute. In transgenic animal models, overex-
pression of MYC leads to deregulated proliferation and tumor development in multiple tissues
(Felsher and Bishop, 1999; Pelengaris et al., 1999; D’Cruz et al., 2001; Jain et al., 2002;
Shachaf et al., 2004). Furthermore, inhibition of MYC almost invariably causes growth arrest of can-
cer cells both in culture and in vivo (Soucek et al., 2002, 2004; Hart et al., 2014). Despite the
importance of MYC for cancer growth, it appears that the role of MYC in controlling growth during
adult tissue homeostasis is limited. In the adult tissues, MYC is expressed in rapidly proliferating
compartments of the body like the intestinal crypts and skin. Deletion of Myc in these compartments
does not result in prominent proliferation defects (Wilson et al., 2004; Baena et al., 2005;
Bettess et al., 2005; Muncan et al., 2006). Although there is still controversy regarding MYC
requirement for the intestinal homeostasis, in the skin MYC is dispensable under normal adult prolif-
eration and homeostasis in vivo (Oskarsson et al., 2006). It is however required for Ras mediated
tumorigenesis and growth of fibroblasts and keratinocytes in vitro (Mateyak et al., 1997;
Oskarsson et al., 2006). Taken together, these results suggest that MYC is required for pathological
proliferation, but is less important and in many cases dispensable for normal homeostasis of tissues
in the adult. Our results are consistent with these observations.
Prior to our study it was not clear whether the MYC dependence of cancer cells in vivo and nor-
mal cells in culture is due to shared regulatory mechanisms. Our results have uncovered striking
mechanistic similarities between growth of normal cells in culture, and growth of cancer cells in vivo
by showing that MYC expression depend on the same genetic elements in cultured normal cells and
in cancer cells. The similarity between tumor cells and cultured normal cells also suggest that many

adult, MYC is expressed at intermediate levels to elicit response from targets with high affinity binding sites (red). In cancer cells or cells grown in
culture (right), upstream regulators such as Tcf7l2 and b-catenin activate the Myc super-enhancers, driving high levels of MYC expression. This leads to
the formation of MYC/MAX heterodimers that strongly activate transcription of MYC target genes driving cancer cell growth. The high levels of MYC
are also sufficient to induce target genes that harbor low affinity MYC binding sites (grey). The model is consistent with the model of Lorenzin et al
(Lorenzin et al., 2016) who showed genes differ in their response to MYC levels due to differences in the MYC affinity of their promoters. Given that
Myc super-enhancer region is tumor-specific, and induction of the MYC target genes are not required for normal homeostasis, it provides a promising
target for antineoplastic therapies.

 potential drugs that block cancer cell growth may have been inadvertently discarded due to their
negative effects on growth of normal cells in culture, even when they might not have affected normal
tissue homeostasis in vivo.
Our results show that the MYC super-enhancer region that carries multi-cancer susceptibility in
humans contributes to the formation of multiple tumor types also in mice. Despite its role in tumor
formation, it is dispensable for normal development and homeostasis. Loss of the super-enhancer
region leads to low MYC expression, but the lowered expression does not translate to changes in
expression of MYC target genes in the intestine. Thus, the MYC/MAX/MNT system (Grandori et al.,
2000) that drives cell growth and proliferation is robustly set to an off state during normal homeo-
stasis, whereas in cancer, the system is locked to a pathological on state. This also explains how
physiological growth control can be robust to small perturbations and transcriptional noise. Taken
together, our results reveal an important difference between the transcriptional states of normal and
cancer cells, and suggest that therapeutic interventions that decrease the activity of the Myc super-
enhancer region would be well tolerated.
Materials and methods
Mouse strains
We generated cKO Myc-196 and cKO Myc-540 strains with loxP sites flanking the regions
chr15:61445326–61447611 and chr15:61789274–61791107, respectively (Taconic). These mice were
crossed to EIIa-cre mouse strain (Jackson Laboratory) to generate mice with enhancer deletions.
Myc-CTCFmut mouse strain was generated by mutating the CTCF-binding site at chr15:61983375–
61983647 TGGCCAGTAGAGGGCAC to TGGAACGTCTTGAATGC. In order to generate large dele-
tions at the Myc locus (Myc42-367 and Myc42–540) Myc-367� and Myc-540� were crossed to Myc-
CTCFmut that were also heterozygous for the Rosa26-Cre (Taconic). The Myc-540�, Myc-196� and
Myc-CTCFmut carry one lox P site at the respective loci (chr15:61445326, chr15:61618287 and
chr15:61983375). The loxP site on chr15:61983375 is located immediately 5’ of the mutant CTCF
binding
site.

compound heterozygotes were screened by PCR for the interallelic recombination and the resultant
deletion and duplication of the intervening sequence. Mice mosaic for the deletion and duplication
were backcrossed to the C57Bl/6 mice in order to segregate the chromosomes carrying the deletion.
The F1 heterozygotes were intercrossed to generate mice with homozygous large deletions. Myc-
335 strain has been previously described (Sur et al., 2012b). All mice used in the study were on a
C57Bl/6 genetic background. All mouse experiments were conducted in accordance with the local
ethical guidelines, after approval of the protocols by the ethics committee of the Board of Agricul-
ture, Experimental Animal Authority, Stockholm South, Sweden (Dnr S50/13, S11/15 and S16/15).
The sequences of the different primer pairs used for genotypings are given in Supplementary file 2.
Mammary gland whole mount analysis
Inguinal mammary glands were removed from 8 week old virgin females and spread on glass slides.
These were fixed for 4 hr in Carnoy’s fixative and subsequently stained O/N with Carmine Alum. The
whole mounts were rinsed and dehydrated through increasing series of ethanol and cleared in
xylene before mounting with the pertex mounting medium.
Quantitative PCR analysis
qPCR was performed as described previously (Sur et al., 2012b). Essentially, total RNA was isolated
from whole tissue by homogenizing in RNA Bee reagent (ambios AMS Biotechnology) followed by
RNA isolation using Qiagen’s RNA MinElute kit according to manufacturers’ protocols. 0.5–1 mg of
total RNA was reverse transcribed using high capacity reverse transcription kit in a 20 ml reaction
(Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR in triplicates was performed using the SYBR select master
mix (Applied Biosystems) on the LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche). For normalization, mouse b-
actin transcripts were used as internal controls. Following primer pairs were used for quantitative
PCR analysis.

RNA-sequencing
NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA library Prep kit (NEB) was used for preparing the samples for RNA-
seq together with the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA magnetic isolation module (NEB) according to manu-
facturers protocol. In the case of tissues 1–2 mg and for cultured fibroblasts 200 ng of total RNA was
used as starting material. For library preparation, adapters and index primers from NEBNext Multi-
plex Oligos for Illumina kit were used. The RNA-seq library was sequenced on a HiSeq2000 (Illu-
mina). Sequencing reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome (NCBI37/mm9) using
Tophat2 (version 2.0.13; RRID:SCR_013035) (Kim et al., 2013). Cuffdiff (version 2.2.1; RRID:SCR_
001647) was used for differential gene expression analysis and for graphical representation, Cum-
meRbund package (version 2.8.2; RRID:SCR_014568) (Trapnell et al., 2012) was used. The upstream
regulator analysis was performed on all the significant differentially expressed genes (Cuffdiff
q-value <0.05) using QIAGEN’s Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN Redwood city, www.qia-
gen.com/ingenuity; version 24718999, updated 2015-09-14; RRID:SCR_008653).
ChIP-seq
ChIP-seq was performed as described in (Sur et al., 2012b; Yan et al., 2013) with the following
modifications: Adult 8–10 week old mice were euthanized and colon was removed, rinsed with cold
PBS and cut into fine pieces. Tissue was crosslinked with 1.5% formaldehyde and cultured cells were
crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and quenched with 0.33M Gly-
cine. Sequences were mapped to the mouse reference genome (NCBI37/mm9) and human reference
genome (hg19) using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (bwa) (version 0.6.2) (Li and Durbin, 2009)
with default parameters. All antibodies used in ChIP-seq experiments were ChIP-grade. In each
experiment a non-specific IgG was used as control. Following antibodies were used for ChIP-seq
experiments: rabbit anti-H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) (abcam, ab4729: RRID:AB_2118291),
mouse anti-H3 lysine four trimethylation (H3K4me3) (abcam, ab1012; RRID:AB_442796), rabbit anti-
Rad21 (Santa Cruz, sc-98784; RRID:AB_2238151), goat anti-CTCF (Santa Cruz, sc-15914X; RRID:AB_

Cruz, sc-2027; RRID:AB_737197), mouse IgG (Santa Cruz, sc-2025; RRID:AB_737182), goat IgG
(Santa Cruz, sc-2028; RRID:AB_737167). ChIPseq data for Tcf7l2 was used from ENA accession num-
ber PRJEB3354 (Sur et al., 2012a) and for GP5d cells from ENA accession number PRJEB1429
(Yan et al., 2013a). For visualization, ChIP-seq read depth data were average smoothed across win-
dows of 10 pixels (H3K27ac and H3K4me3) or five pixels (Tcf7l2) in UCSC Genome Browser; RRID:
SCR_005780 or alternatively visualized in Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV, version 2.3; RRID:SCR_
011793).
Bisulfite sequencing
Genomic DNA was isolated using Qiagen’s Blood & Tissue Genomic DNA extraction kit. Around 1
mg of wild-type and 250 ng of Myc42–540/42-540 null fibroblast genomic DNA was sonicated to 300
bp fragments using Covaris S220 sonicator. Subsequent to end polishing and A base addition, cyto-
sine methylated paired end adapters (Integrated DNA technologies) were ligated to the DNA frag-
ments. The adapter sequences are as follows
5’-P-GATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAG
5’-ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT
After adapter ligation 300–600 bp fragments were size-selected on a 2% agarose gel. Bisulfite-
conversion was carried out using ZYMO EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (cat. no. D5005). PCR amplifi-
cation with 12 and 18 cycles was carried out to prepare libraries from the wild-type and Myc42–540/
42–540 null mouse fibroblasts, respectively. The primer pair used for PCR amplification was as follows

The final library was size-selected for 250–300 bp fragments on a 2% agarose gel and 150 bp
sequenced from both ends on two lanes of a HiSeq 4000 (Illumina). Raw sequencing reads were
quality and adapter trimmed with cutadapt version 1.8.1 (RRID:SCR_011841) in Trim Galore version
0.4.0 (RRID:SCR_011847). Trimming of low-quality ends was done using Phred score cutoff 30. In
addition, all reads were trimmed by 2 bp from their 3’ end. Adapter trimming was performed using
the first 13 bp of the standard Illumina paired-end adapters with stringency overlap two and error
rate 0.1. Read alignment was performed against mouse genome mm9 with Bismark (version v0.14.3;
RRID:SCR_005604) (Krueger and Andrews, 2011) and Bowtie 2 (version 2.2.4; RRID:SCR_005476)
(Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). Duplicates were removed using the Bismark deduplicate function.
Extraction of methylation calls was done with Bismark methylation extractor discarding first 10 bp of
both reads and reading methylation calls of overlapping parts of the paired reads from the first read
(–no_overlap parameter). Genomic sites with the coverage of at least 10 reads were considered and
methylation ratios smoothed with loess method across 49 bp windows.
All sequencing data is uploaded to European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, EMBL-EBI; RRID:SCR_
006515) under accession number PRJEB11397 (Dave et al., 2016; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/
view/PRJEB11397).
Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry
Five micron paraffin embedded tissue sections were processed for immuno-histochemistry as previ-
ously described (Sur et al., 2012b). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc (Santa Cruz, sc-764; RRID:AB_
631276) (1:500), Rabbit monoclonal anti Ki-67 (abcam, ab16667; RRID:AB_302459) (1:200), Goat
polyclonal anti-Vimentin (Santa Cruz, sc-7557; RRID:AB_793998) (1:500), biotinylated goat anti-Rab-
bit IgG (Vector Laboratories, BA1000; RRID:AB_2313606) and biotinylated rabbit anti-Goat IgG (Vec-
tor Laboratories, BA5000; RRID:AB_2336126) (1:350) antibodies were used. For flow cytometry,
single cell suspensions of spleen and bone-marrow and cells from peripheral blood were stained
with Fc-block (CD16/CD32 clone 93, Biolegend, 101302, RRID:AB_312801) and subsequently with
CD19 (clone 1D3, BD Biosciences, RRID:AB_11154223), TER119 (clone TER119, Biolegend 116210,
RRID:AB_313711), CD3e (clone 145–2 C11, Biolegend 100308, RRID:AB_312673), NK1.1(clone
PK136, Biolegend, 108716, RRID:AB_493590), GR1/LY6G (clone RB6-8C5, Biolegend, 108410, RRID:
AB_313375), CD4 (clone RM4-5, BD Biosciences, 563747) and CD8a (clone 53–6.7, BD Biosciences,
563332). Dead cells were visualized using Propidium iodide. Samples were analyzed using a BD
LSRFortessa instrument.
Isolation and culture of mouse primary fibroblasts
Fibroblasts were isolated from adult mice by dissecting the skin to ~1 mm3 pieces, and allowing the
pieces to adhere to cell culture plates, followed by addition of DMEM medium supplemented with
10% FCS and antibiotics. The fibroblasts were allowed to migrate out from the explants, after which
the cells were collected by trypsinization and passaged in the same media for 1–3 passages. For
growth assays, 2 � 103 cells were plated per well in 96 well plates. Cells were trypsinized and
counted using hemocytometer at respective time points.
Tumor induction
Mammary tumors
Six week-old female mice were implanted s.c. with medroxypregesterone acetate (MPA) pellets (50
mg with a 90 days release period from Innovative Research of America). Subsequently 100 ml of 10
mg/ml dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)/oil solution (Sigma) was administered via gavage at 7, 8,
10, 11, 13 and 14 weeks of age. Mice were checked twice a week for development of palpable
tumors. Detection of palpable mass in the mammary gland was taken as the end point for tumor-
free survival analysis.

 Bladder tumors
Ten week-old male mice were administered 0.1% N-Butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN)
(Sigma) in drinking water for five months. At the end of the treatment the mice were sacrificed and
the bladders scored for tumor development.
Intestinal tumors
Apcmin mouse strain (Jackson Laboratory RRID:MGI:5438590) was used as a model for spontaneous
development of intestinal tumors.
CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletion of super-enhancer region in GP5d cell
line
CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletion of MYC super-enhancer region on chromosome 8q24 (GRCh37/
hg19 chr8: 128226403–128746490) and Immunoglobulin Heavy (IGH) gene locus on chromo-
some 14q32.33 (GRCh37/hg19 chr14: 106527004–107035452) were carried out in GP5d (Sigma,
95090715; RRID:CVCL_1235, confirmed by STR profiling at ECACC) colon cancer cell line stably
expressing Cas9 protein. A lentiviral plasmid containing Cas9 fused via a self-cleaving 2A pep-
tide to a blasticidin resistance gene, was packaged into lentiviral particles using the packaging
plasmids psPAX2 (a gift from Didier Trono, Addgene plasmid # 12260, RRID:SCR_002037) and
pCMV-VSV-G (a gift from Robert Weinberg (Addgene plasmid # 8454, RRID:SCR_002037). The
virus was used to transduce GP5d colon cancer cells. 48 hr after transduction, GP5d cells
expressing Cas9 (GP5d-Cas9) were selected in 5 mg/ml Blasticidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,
Cat. no. A1113903). The single guide RNA (sgRNA’s) were designed (http://www.broadinstitute.
org/rnai/public/analysis-tools/sgrna-design) to span the entire MYC super-enhancer region and
IGH locus (Figure 6), respectively (Eurofins MWG Operon). sgRNAs were cloned into an sgRNA
Cloning Vector (Addgene Plasmid #41824, RRID:SCR_002037) using Gibson assembly master
mix (NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly Master Mix, Cat no. E2621S). GP5d-Cas9 (2 � 106) cells
were transfected (using FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent, Cat.no E2312) with 10 mg of eight
pooled equimolar sgRNA constructs. Post transfection half of the cultured cells were collected
for PCR genotyping, while the other half was re-plated for culturing. Cells were collected at
day 2, 4 and subsequently every fourth day till day 32. DNA from cells was extracted (using
DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit, Qiagen Cat. no. 69506) and genotyped with 300 ng of DNA at fol-
lowing conditions - Initial denaturation of 95˚C for 5 min; denaturation of 98˚C for 15 s, anneal-
ing at 60˚C for 30 s, extension at 72˚C for 30 s (30 cycles for MYC super-enhancer region and
35 cycles for IGH gene locus deletion genotyping); final extension at 72˚C, 5 min. Each experi-
ment was done in triplicate. The sequences of the different guide RNAs and primer pairs used
for PCR genotyping of the deletions are given in Supplementary file 2. GP5d cells were cul-
tured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. The cell line was mycoplasma
free.

Purification of primary mouse cells
Bone marrow (BM) cells harvested from 8- to 12 weeks old C57BL/6 mice. For isolation of LSK
Flt3- cells, BM cells were subjected to depletion of mature cells using a cocktail of purified
antibodies containing TER119 (TER-119; Biolegend 116202; RRID:AB_313703), CD19 (1D3;
BD, 553783; RRID:AB_395047), CD3 (17A2; BD, 555273; RRID:AB_395697), GR1 (RB6-8C5;
Biolegend, 108402; RRID:AB_313367) and CD11b (M1/70; Biolegend, 101202; RRID:AB_
312785) in combination with sheep anti-rat IgG Dynabeads (Invitrogen; 11035). Non-
depleted cells were stained with Ter119 PECy5 (TER-119; Biolegend, 116210; RRID:AB_
313711), NK1.1 PECy5 (PK136; Biolegend, 108716; RRID:AB_493590), CD3 PECy5 (145–2
C11; Biolegend, 100310; RRID:AB_312675), GR1 PECy5 (RB6-8C5; Biolegend, 108410; RRID:
AB_313375), CD11b PECy5 (M1/70; Biolegend, 101210; RRID:AB_312793), CD19 PECF594
(1D3; BD, 562291; RRID:AB_11154223), KIT (CD117) APCeFlour780 (2B8; eBioscience, 47-
1171-82; RRID:AB_1272177), SCA1 PB (D7; Biolegend, 108120; RRID:AB_493273), FLT3
(CD135) PE (A2F10; Biolegend, 135306; RRID:AB_1877217), CD11C PECy7 (N418;
Biolegend, 117318; RRID:AB_493568), LY6C APC (HK1.4: Biolegend, 128016; RRID:AB_
1732076) and IL7R (CD127) biotin (A7R34 Biolegend 135006; RRID:AB_2126118; visualized
using Streptavidin-QD655; Invitrogen Q10121MP). LSK FLT3- (HSCs) cells were subsequently
FACS sorted as TER119/CD3/GR1/NK1.1/
MAC1low/-CD19-LY6C-CD11C-IL7R-SCA1+KIT+FLT3-. For isolation of mature B cells, BM cells
were subjected to MACS column enrichment of CD45R (B220)+ cells using anti-CD45R
beads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-049-501). B220 enriched cells were stained with TER119 PECy5
(TER-119), GR1 PECy5 (RB6-8C5), CD11b PECy5 (M1/70), IgD PB (11–26c.2a; Biolegend,
405712; RRID:AB_1937244), IgM PECy7 (11/14; eBioscience 25-5790-82; RRID:AB_469655),
CD19 PECF594 (1D3). Mature B cells subsequently FACS sorted as TER119/GR1/
MAC1-CD19+IgM+IgD+. Propidium iodide (Life technologies, p3566) was used as a dead cell
discriminator when sorting live cells (for RNAseq experiments) and Aqua fluorescent reactive
dye (Life technologies; L34957) when sorting fixed cells (for ChIPseq experiments).
For ChIPseq experiments, fully antibody/viability dye-stained cells (5 � 106 cells/ml) were
fixed by incubation with 1% formaldehyde (ThermoFisher Scientific; 28908) for 10 min at
room temperature (RT). Formaldehyde was quenched using 0.1 vol 1 M glycine and
incubated for 10 min at RT. Cells were additionally washed with 0.1 M glycine before being
resuspended in PBS with 2% FCS prior to FACS sorting. Cell sorting was done on a BD
FACSAriaIII cell sorter (BD Biosciences).
ChIP-sequencing
3 mg of polyclonal anti-H3K27Ac (Diagenode, cat# C15410196, lot# A1723-0041D, RRID:AB_
2637079) or H3K4me2 (Millipore, cat#07–030, lot#2089140 and lot#2309072, RRID:AB_
11213050) antibody was bound to 10 ml Protein G-coupled Dynabeads (ThermoFisher) per
ChIP and incubated with rotation for 4 hr at 4˚C. Pellets of 0.5 � 106 PFA-fixed cells were
resuspended in 100 ml SDS lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, 0.5% SDS, and 10 mM EDTA),
placed cold for 15 min and sonicated for 12 cycles of 30 s on/30 s off on high power using a
Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode). Samples were centrifuged, and supernatants transferred to new
tubes. After addition of 200 ml of ChIP dilution buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, 225 mM NaCl, 0.15%
NaDoc, and 1.5% Triton-X) and 4 ml of 50X protease inhibitors (Roche), samples were
incubated at room temperature for 10 min. 10% of each sample was saved for input
controls. Antibody-coated dynabeads were washed, resuspended with cell lysate and
rotated overnight at 4˚C.

 Immunoprecipitated chromatin was washed once with low salt buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, 150
mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% NaDOC, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA), high salt buffer (50 mM
Tris/HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% NaDoc, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM EDTA) and LiCl
buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, 250 mM LiCl, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% NaDoc, 1 mM EDTA)
followed by two washings with TE buffer. For reversal of crosslinking, chromatin complexes
and input control samples were diluted in 200 ml ChIP elution buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, 0.5%
SDS, 300 mM NaCl, and 5 mM EDTA) and 2 ml of 20 mg/ml proteinase K (Thermo Scientific).
Samples were vortexed and incubated shaking overnight at 65˚C. After reverse crosslinking,
1 ml 20 mg/ml RNAse (Sigma) was added and incubated at 37˚C for 30 min. After another 2
hr of incubation with 2 ml of proteinase K at 55˚C, samples were placed in a magnet to trap
magnetic beads and supernatant collected. DNA purification was carried out using Qiagen
MinElute PCR Purification Kit.
DNA concentrations in purified samples were measured using Qubit dsDNA HS Kit
(Invitrogen). Libraries were prepared using Rubicon ThruPLEX DNA-seq 12S Kit, according
to manufacturer’s instructions. 2 ng of chromatin was used when available but samples
below Qubit detection levels (<0.5–1.5 ng) were frequently used. After 11 cycles of PCR
amplification, adapter cleanup was done using Agencourt AmPureXP beads (Beckman
Coulter) at a ratio of 1:0.88. Libraries with an average size of 400–500 bp were pooled and
single-end sequenced (50 cycles) using the Illumina sequencing platform (HiSeq2000).
RNA-sequencing
For RNA extraction 5,000–10,000 cells were sorted into buffer RLT (Qiagen) with b-
mercaptoethanol and total RNA was extracted using Rneasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) according to
manufacturers instructions. On-column DNase I treatment was performed to minimize DNA
contamination. Strand specific RNAseq libraries were prepared using TotalScript RNA-seq
kit (Epicentre) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Barcoded libraries were pooled
and pair-end sequenced (2 � 50 cycles) using the Illumina platform (mainly HighSeq 2500).
ChIP-seq data analysis
Quality of sequencing samples was assessed with FastQC (v0.11.2). Samples were mapped to
the mm10 genome using Bowtie2 (v2.2.3) with default parameters (Langmead and
Salzberg, 2012). Mapped reads were filtered with HOMER (v4.6) (Heinz et al., 2010) using
the makeTagDirectory command, only keeping uniquely mapped reads and removing
possible PCR duplicates by restricting the tags per base pair to 1 (-tbp 1). Resulting filtered
reads were visualized by generating bigWig files from tag directories, using HOMER’s
makeBigWig.pl with a set fragment length (fragLength 130) and normalization to 10 million
reads (-norm 1e7).
RNA-seq data analysis
Quality of sequencing samples was assessed with FastQC (v0.11.2) (Andrews, 2010). Samples
were mapped to the mm10 genome using STAR (v2.4) with default parameters for paired-
end reads (Dobin et al., 2013). Mapped reads were filtered with HOMER (v4.6) using the
makeTagDirectory command with strand specific pair-end read settings (-sspe), and
removing excessive possible PCR duplicates by restricting the tags per base pair to 3 (-tbp
3). Resulting filtered reads were visualized by generating bigWig files from tag directories,
