Current guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology advocate regular physical activity as a Class IA recommendation for the preven-
tion and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Despite its undisputed multitude of beneficial effects, competitive athletes with arterial
hypertension may be exposed to an increased risk of cardiovascular events. This document is an update of the 2005 recommendations
and will give guidance to physicians who have to decide on the risk of an athlete during sport participation.

Introduction
Arterial hypertension is the most relevant risk factor for cardiovascu-
lar disease worldwide and one of the most common abnormalities
identified during clinical evaluation of athletes.1 The European
Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines advocate regular physical ac-
tivity as a Class IA recommendation for the prevention and treatment
of cardiovascular disease,2 which is contributing to the growing num-
ber of hypertensive individuals who train regularly and wish to engage
in competitive sport.3
Arterial hypertension has been recognized as a risk factor to cor-
onary artery disease progression and left ventricular (LV) hyper-
trophy, which represent substrates for myocardial infarction and
ventricular arrhythmias.4 Moreover, arterial hypertension induces
structural changes in end-organs including the retina, kidneys, and
brain that can lead to injury and increase the risk of spontaneous hae-
morrhage.5 Furthermore, an acute increase in blood pressure (BP)
during effort may trigger atherosclerotic plaque rupture6–9 leading to
ischaemic myocardial or cerebrovascular events.4,6–9 Therefore,
timely identification of hypertensive individuals is paramount in the
setting of pre-participation screening, in order to implement a health-
ier lifestyle, appropriate management and follow-up.10–13
For the purpose of the present position statement, our panel of
experts was to propose recommendations, which represent the
best possible balance between risks and benefits inherent with
competitive sports participation, based on scientific evidence,
when available, and consensus of experts. Detailed information
on the classification, prevalence, evaluation, and recommendation
for patients with arterial hypertension can be found in the current
European Society of Hypertension (ESH)/ESC guidelines. 5

In this document, competitive athletes are defined as individuals of
all ages, who engage in exercise training on a regular basis and partici-
pate
in
official
sports
competition,
be
it
as
amateurs
or
professionals.14,15
Classification
Hypertension is defined as systolic BP >
_140 mmHg and/or diastolic
BP >
_90 mmHg (Table 1), repeatedly measured in the office.16
Importantly, children and adolescents have lower BP levels with
normal values <120/80 mmHg.17,18 In adults, the threshold for an
elevated 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is
>
_130/80 mmHg
(daytime:
>
_135/85 mmHg;
night-time:
>
_120/
70mm Hg).5,16,19 The cuff size should be chosen according to the cir-
cumference of the athlete’s arm, and in case of asymmetric exercises
(e.g. shot put, tennis, etc.) BP can be measured in the non-dominant
arm.
Isolated systolic hypertension and isolated diastolic hypertension,
both not rare in young men, correspond to an elevated systolic BP
with normal diastolic BP or an elevated diastolic BP with normal sys-
tolic BP, respectively.
Subjects with elevated BP in the clinic and normal home blood
pressure monitoring (HBPM) and/or ABPM have white-coat or iso-
lated clinic hypertension, those with normal office BP but elevated
HBPM and/or ABPM have masked hypertension.20,21 Also in these
conditions, thresholds given above for ABPM and HBPM apply.
During exercise, physiologically systolic BP increases and diastolic
BP remains stable or mildly decreases. Even though the association
between an exaggerated BP response during exercise testing and car-
diovascular events is not well established, it has been related to inci-
dent hypertension.22 Also, 200mmHg at 100 W has been
demonstrated to independently predict long-term mortality in
healthy middle-aged men.23 In Olympic, athletes systolic BP of
220 mmHg in males and 200 mmHg in females measured during cycle
ergometry are beyond the 95th percentile23 and thus warrant further
follow-up evaluation including ABPM.24
Prevalence
The largest study on arterial hypertension in athletes in Europe
(n = 2000; age 25± 6 years; 64% males) reported a prevalence of 3%
with only a small minority (0.2%) with secondary hypertension.25
Evaluation
Assessment of hypertension has to be carried out in the context of
other cardiovascular risk factors and resulting target organ damage
like cardiovascular and/or renal complications (Table 2).16 Testing for
microalbuminuria after 24 h rest26 and tissue Doppler imaging for pla-
que detection of carotid arteries may be considered in high-risk sub-
jects. Also, clinical history, assessment of cardiovascular risk, physical
examination, and subsequent diagnostic tests should be performed in
order to exclude secondary causes, which may account for 5–10%, as
they may be reversed with appropriate management.27 Indeed, widely
used supplements, energy drinks, medications (including anti-
inflammatory drugs or thyroid hormones for weight reduction), or
performance enhancing substances (e.g. erythropoietin, anabolic
steroids) are an underestimated cause of secondary hypertension.28,29
Secondary causes of hypertension should be sought in individuals if:
(1)
Age at onset <30 years,
(2)
Absence of risk factors including family history of hypertension,
(3)
Grade 3 hypertension (>
_180/110 mmHg) or hypertensive emer-
gencies, and
(4)
Sudden increase in BP in a previously normotensive individual or re-
sistant hypertension despite medical treatment.27
In case of border line office measurements or in athletes with
white-coat or masked hypertension, HBPM and ABPM also during
training sessions should be performed.

and mass (>110 g/m2 in men, >95 g/m2 in women),30 impaired relax-
ation (measured by tissue Doppler echocardiography) or systolic
dysfunction (assessed by longitudinal strain analysis),31–34 valves, and
the ascending aorta.
Long-term, high-volume, and high-intensity endurance sport it-
self may induce enlargement of all cardiac cavities and mild LV
hypertrophy, better known as athlete’s heart. Whereas these
physiological adaptations are reversible by detraining,35 remodel-
ling caused by hypertension is not, but is amenable to effective BP
lowering therapy.
Exercise testing (with ECG and BP monitoring)25 should be routinely
performed to assess exercise capacity and to rule out exercise-induced
hypertension. As stated above, BP values obtained during exercise
should not be used for a definitive diagnosis of hypertension,36 since it is
uncertain whether it is a reliable predictor of overt arterial hypertension
later in life.24,37–39 Nonetheless, at least annual follow-up preferably with
ABPM and particular attention to cardiovascular risk factors is war-
ranted, but without restriction from any competitive sport.23
Risk stratification
The terms low-, moderate-, high-, and very high-risk correspond to ap-
proximate absolute 10-year risks of cardiovascular mortality of <1%,
1–4%, 5–10%, and >10%, respectively, according to the European
SCORE system as defined by the 2016 ESC prevention guidelines.2
Recommendations
General recommendations
Athletes with hypertension should be treated according to general
guidelines.27 Appropriate non-pharmacological measures should be
considered as the first step: salt restriction, weight reduction when
obesity is present, alcohol restriction, increased consumption of veg-
etables and fruits, smoking cessation, discontinuation of supplements,
ergogenic,
and/or
anti-inflammatory
drugs.
Aerobic-exercise
Figure 1 Pre-participation examination in competitive athletes with arterial hypertension. Evaluation includes family and personal history, cardio-
vascular risk profile, physical examination, blood pressure, and resting 12-lead ECG. Additional tests according to current guidelines. If blood pressure
is <140/90 mmHg (<140/85 mmHg in diabetic), all competitive sports are allowed. Otherwise, no competitive sports until normalization of values.
Depending on associated clinical conditions and/or target organ damage restrictions may apply (Table 4).

programmes should complement athletes’ training schedules. (Level
of evidence: IB).
Athletes should be periodically reassessed and in case of low or
moderate risk, drug treatment is initiated when hypertension persists,
e.g. 3 months after appropriate lifestyle changes have been imple-
mented or when out-of-office BP remains elevated. It is not recom-
mended to initiate antihypertensive therapy at high normal BP,
however, lifestyle changes are encouraged. Antihypertensive drug
therapy should be started promptly in athletes with Grade 3 hyper-
tension and/or high- or very high risk for cardiovascular complica-
tions (Table 3). (Level of evidence: IB).
The goal of antihypertensive therapy is to reduce BP to <140/
90mmHg and to <140/85 mmHg in diabetic athletes,5 although the
current trend is to adopt lower values, i.e. <130/80, as recently advo-
cated in the ACC/AHA guidelines.40 (Level of evidence: IB).
With regard to white-coat or masked hypertension, ABPM may be
particularly useful in assessing BP load. With regard to antihyperten-
sive drugs, current evidence indicates that they are not required. In
the absence of randomized trials, it will remain an individual decision
to prescribe antihypertensive drugs even in patients with high- or
very high cardiovascular risk (Table 3). In any case, regular follow-up
and non-pharmacological measures are recommended.27 Also, since
it remains uncertain whether isolated systolic or isolated diastolic
hypertension progress to overt hypertension or benefit from drug
treatment, only lifestyle changes are warranted. (Level of evidence: IB).
Choice of drugs
Athletes who compete at national and/or international level have to
review the current list of prohibited substances and methods of the
World Anti-Doping Association41 before starting drug therapy. If
required, a therapeutic use exemption has to be obtained in order to
receive the authorization to take the needed medicine.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II recep-
tor blockers are the preferred choice as they do not affect exercise
capacity and are not on the doping list. However, they shall not be
given to females during reproductive years, because of potential ad-
verse foetal/neonatal effects.
Alternatively or additionally calcium channel blockers are a pre-
ferred choice in athletes. If more than one drug is required, com-
bination drugs should be considered as they may improve
compliance. Beta blockers are rarely used as second line therapy,
as they can generally not be given in athletes with bradycardia
<50/min and/or second or third degree AV block. Furthermore,
different beta blockers (selective/non selective, older/newer com-
pounds, with/without vasodilatory properties) negatively impact
aerobic-exercise performance, which may interfere with compli-
ance. Also, beta blockers are prohibited and considered as doping
in some sports like archery and shooting where control of tremor
is seeked.16,42
Diuretics are banned at all times and in all sports, since they may
mask performance-enhancing drugs.43,44

blood pressure) and long-term impact on cardiac output and remodelling.45,46 Skill sports: achievement depends on technical or bodily skill. Increase
in heart rate is accompanied by modest increase in blood pressure and cardiac output. No cardiac remodelling. Power sports: achievement depends
on explosive muscle power (i.e. high-static exercise). Substantial increase in heart rate and blood pressure during repeated bursts. Cardiac remodel-
ling with increase in left ventricular wall thickness and modest increase in left ventricular cavity size and function occurs. Mixed sports: alternating
phases of dynamic and/or static work and recovery (e.g. ball and team sports). Duration and exercise intensity vary largely according to type of sport
and the role the athlete plays. Phasic increases in heart rate and blood pressure may reach near-maximum values, alternating with recovery phases.
There is cardiac remodelling with increase in left ventricular cavity size and modest change in left ventricular wall thickness. Endurance sports: pro-
longed and intensive high dynamic, often associated with high-static exercise at near maximal cardiac output, through increase in heart rate, and blood
pressure over several hours. Cardiac remodelling with significant increase in left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness is present. -/þ: no, þ: weak,

Recommendations for competitive sports participation
Recommendations are based on risk stratification and with the
understanding that the clinical condition is stable and that general rec-
ommendations for the management of hypertension are observed as
described above (Table 4).
1. In patients with low- or moderate-cardiovascular risk, usually no
restrictions apply. If BP values are not normalized, temporary restric-
tion from competitive sport is recommended, with possible excep-
tion of skill disciplines (Figures 1 and 2).
2. In patients with high-risk or very high-risk in whom control of BP
has been achieved, participation in all competitive sports is possible,
with the exception of power disciplines (Figures 1 and 2). If BP values
are not well controlled, temporary restriction from competitive
sport is recommended.
Leisure-time and amateur sport
activities
Regular exercise training has been shown to reduce morbidity and
mortality47 and is thus a Class IA indication.2 Patients are advised to
perform at least 30 min of moderate-intensity, preferably (but not ex-
clusively) aerobic-exercise training, 5–7 days per week.5 In patients

with low- or moderate cardiovascular risk high-intensity exercises
can be performed,48 even if common but arbitrary cut-offs, e.g. sys-
tolic BP >
_240mmHg, are exceeded during peak intervals.
Follow-up
Patients need to be followed up regularly by their physicians. In add-
ition, during annual pre-competition medical examination BP needs
to be measured at rest and during exercise testing. Furthermore, pos-
sible reversal or progression of existing target organ damage has to
be assessed by ECG, echocardiography, kidney testing, and/or retinal
examination.
An ACC/AHA statement9 recommends athletes with hyperten-
sion who wish to engage in training for competitive sports to undergo
prior clinical assessment including BP, which is in keeping with this
position statement and our ESC consensus statement.49
Summary
The prevalence of arterial hypertension is high overall, increasing
with age and unfavourably influenced by western diet and behaviour
even in athletes. Therefore, screening should also focus on adoles-
cent athletes. Special considerations have to be given regarding the
pharmacological treatment of hypertension in athletes. While eligibil-
ity for competitive sports may have to be restricted if target organ
damage is present, an athlete with well-controlled BP, having no add-
itional risk factors or target organ damage, is eligible for competition
in all sports.
