Background-—In-hospital discontinuation of statins has been linked to poorer early stroke outcomes, but the consequences of
postdischarge discontinuation or dose reduction of statin treatment are unknown. The objective of this study was to explore the
effects of statin discontinuation or statin dose reduction on recurrent stroke risk.
Methods and Results-—We conducted a nationwide cohort study using the data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance
Research Database. Our source population comprised all patients who were prescribed a statin within 90 days of discharge after
an ischemic stroke between 2001 and 2012. Patients were categorized into 3 groups: statin-discontinued, statin-reduced, and
statin-maintained. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratios and 95%CIs of recurrent stroke during
1-year follow-up in the groups who discontinued statins or reduced statin dose compared with the group who maintained statins as
the reference. Among the 45 151 ischemic stroke patients meeting criteria, during the day-90 to day-180 period, 7.0% were on
reduced statin therapy, and 18.5% were not on any statin therapy. Compared with maintained-statin intensity therapy,
discontinuation of statins was associated with an increased hazard of recurrent stroke (adjusted hazard ratio 1.42, 95%CI 1.28-
1.57), whereas reduced-statin dose was not associated with an additional risk (adjusted hazard ratio 0.94, 95%CI 0.78-1.12).
Propensity-matching analysis obtained similar results.
Conclusions-—Discontinuation of statin therapy between 3 and 6 months after an index ischemic stroke was associated with a
higher risk of recurrent stroke within 1 year after statin discontinuation. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2017;6:e005658. DOI: 10.1161/

I
t is now well established that treatment with statins
reduces the frequency of first and recurrent ischemic
stroke.1,2 Expert consensus guidelines recommend statin
treatment for patients who have experienced an ischemic
stroke or transient ischemic attack due to large- or small-
artery atherosclerosis.3 Moreover, prestroke statin use, in-
hospital statin initiation, nondiscontinuation of premorbid
statins in the hospital have all been linked to better early
stroke outcomes.4 However, in routine clinical practice, many
high-risk patients are not maintained on statin therapy beyond
the initial period.5 The effects of discontinuing or reducing
statin treatment beyond the initial period (first 3 months)
after an index ischemic stroke have not been well studied. A
single-center study of modest sample size found that patients
discontinuing their use of statins during the first year after the
acute cerebrovascular event had higher mortality,6 but that
study did not look at the outcome of recurrent stroke, and
larger multicenter data are warranted.
Given the limited data on the impact of changes to statin
prescription just beyond the initial period following an

 ischemic stroke, the objective of this study was to explore the
effects of statin discontinuation or statin dose reduction on
recurrent stroke risk in a large, nationwide, multicenter “real
world” patient population.
Methods
Study Design and Data Set
We conducted a retrospective cohort study by retrieving all
hospitalized patients (≥20 years) with a primary diagnosis of
ischemic stroke from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2012
using Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database
(NHIRD). The Taiwan National Health Insurance program was
launched in 1995. It covers 99% of the population and
reimburses for outpatient and inpatient services as well as
prescription drugs. All contracted institutions must file claims
according to standard formats, which later transform into
NHIRD. This study has been approved by the institutional review
board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi, Taiwan.
Study Population
We identified all hospitalized patients who were admitted with
a primary diagnosis of ischemic stroke (International Classi-
fication of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] codes 433.X1,
434.X1, 436)
among
subjects
(≥20 years)
encountered
between 2001 and 2012. This was a nationwide study that
included all available and eligible patients. The requirement of
informed consent from subjects included in this study was
waived. The accuracy of the diagnosis of stroke has been
validated by a prior study showing that among confirmed
cases of acute ischemic stroke in a hospital medical record,
94.5% were assigned “ischemic stroke” as the principal
diagnosis in the NHIRD.7
We defined the first ischemic stroke during the study
period as the index stroke. Stroke severity was evaluated by
The Stroke Severity Index (airway suctioning, bacterial
sensitivity test, general ward stay, intensive care unit stay,
nasogastric intubation, osmotherapy, and urinary catheteriza-
tion), developed specifically to evaluate the severity of strokes
in Taiwan NHIRD.8 Information regarding patients’ medica-
tions during the first 180 days after discharge from the index
stroke
was
retrieved
from
the
pharmacy
prescription
database.
During the study period, the Taiwan National Health Bureau
would only reimburse initial statin prescriptions for stroke
patients if the total cholesterol was ≥200 mg/dL or the low-
density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol was ≥130 mg/dL. Fur-
thermore, it was recommended that statins be discontinued
or reduced in intensity once goal cholesterol levels were
reached (total cholesterol <160 mg/dL or LDL-cholesterol
<100 mg/dL). To explore the effect of statin discontinuation
or statin dose reduction in the chronic poststroke period, we
assessed patients receiving high-intensity or moderate-
intensity statin therapy within 90 days after discharge for
the index stroke. The 2013 ACC/AHA guideline recom-
mended initiation of a high-intensity statin in patients with
clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (eg, stroke)
aged ≤75 years and moderate-intensity statin in patients
aged >75 years.3 Therefore, we did not enroll patients on a
low-intensity statin at the start of the study. Statin intensity
was defined based on 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines on the
treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic
cardiovascular risk in adults.3 For a daily dose lowering LDL-
cholesterol by ≥50%, atorvastatin 40 to 80 mg or rosuvastatin
20 to 40 mg was categorized as high-intensity statin therapy.
For a daily dose lowering LDL-cholesterol by 30% to <50%,
atorvastatin 10 to 20 mg, rosuvastatin 5 to 10 mg, simvas-
tatin 20 mg to 40 mg, pravastatin 40 to 80 mg, lovastatin
40 mg, fluvastatin 80 mg, or pitavastatin 2 to 4 mg was
categorized as moderate-intensity statin therapy. For a daily
dose lowering LDL-cholesterol by <30%, simvastatin 10 mg,
pravastatin 10 to 20 mg, lovastatin 20 mg, fluvastatin 20 to
40 mg, or pitavastatin 1 mg was categorized as low-intensity
statin therapy. Patients receiving the combination of low-
intensity statin with ezetimibe were regarded as receiving
moderate-intensity statin therapy. Patients receiving the
combination of moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe were
regarded as receiving high-intensity statin therapy. We then
categorized
these
patients
into
3
groups.
The
statin-
discontinuation group was defined as patients not receiving
any statin between day 91 and day 180 after discharge. The
statin-reduced group was defined as patients receiving low-
intensity statin therapy or changing their medication from
high-intensity statin to moderate-intensity statin between day
91 and day 180 after discharge. The statin-maintained group
was defined as patients receiving high-intensity or moderate-
intensity statin therapy between day 91 and day 180 after
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Discontinuation of statin therapy between 3 and 6 months
after an index ischemic stroke is associated with a higher
risk of recurrent stroke within 1 year after statin discontin-
uation.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Discontinuation
of
statin
treatment
in
patients
with
ischemic stroke of large- or small-vessel atherosclerotic
origin taking a statin who have reached a target low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol goal should be strongly discouraged.

 discharge. Because use of an oral anticoagulant, rather than
statin therapy, is the major factor affecting risk of recurrent
stroke for ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation, we
excluded patients with atrial fibrillation from this study.
Because antiplatelet therapy is a standard therapy for
secondary stroke prevention in ischemic stroke patients
without atrial fibrillation, patients who did not receive
antiplatelet therapy within 90 days or between day 91 and
day 180 after discharge were excluded. We also excluded
patients with end-stage renal disease and having recurrent
stroke within 180 days of discharge from index stroke. The
study population was followed from day 181 after index
stroke discharge to the date of recurrent stroke (code 430-
432, 433.X1, 434.X1, or 436), death, or 1 year from day 181
(ie, 545 days after discharge), whichever came first. Recur-
rent stroke events were identified only if patients received
brain computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance
imaging during hospitalization for recurrent stroke or within
7 days before hospitalization at an outpatient or emergency
department. The requirement for imaging served to exclude
stroke patients who were hospitalized solely for rehabilitation
during the chronic stage.
We assessed the comorbidities considered to be potential
confounding factors for computing the propensity score.
These comorbidities were selected based on prior clinical
knowledge about established risk factors for stroke recur-
rence, and the univariable analyses indicated an association
with stroke recurrence in this particular study. In addition to
age, sex, and stroke severity index, the comorbidities
included in propensity score analysis were hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, ischemic heart disease,
stroke history, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease,
and sleep apnea. Comorbidities were identified using ICD-9
codes based on coding of concomitant diagnoses during the
index stroke hospitalization and on coding for all outpatient
visits before the index stroke. Comorbidities from ICD-9
codes in Taiwan NHIRD have been validated in a prior study,7
and the comorbidities that were considered in multivariable
models are listed in Table 1. Potential factors or complica-
tions, such as myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, and memory/
cognitive impairment, between day 91 and day 180 that
may
lead
to
statin
discontinuation
or
reducing
statin
intensity were retrieved. Information on antihypertensive
therapy in each group between day 91 and day 180 was also
retrieved.
Main Outcome Measures
The primary outcome of this study was the first occurrence of
recurrent stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic). The secondary
end points were all-cause mortality, intracerebral hemorrhage
(code 431), ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction (code 410),
all major events (composite of ischemic and hemorrhagic
stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality), and any
hospitalization in the 1-year follow-up period (ie, 6 to
18 months after discharge from index stroke). All-cause
mortality analyzed included those that occurred during a
rehospitalization. Data regarding deaths occurring without a
hospitalization were not captured.
Statistical Analysis
The baseline characteristics of 3 groups (statin-discontinued
versus statin-reduced versus statin-maintained) were com-
pared using a Student t test for continuous variables and a
chi-squared test for categorical variables. To mitigate differ-
ences of baseline characteristics among groups, we con-
ducted
propensity
score
matching
with
2
contrasts
separately: statin discontinuation versus maintenance, and
dose reduction versus maintenance. For each of the 2
contrasts, we performed logistic regression models separately
to estimate a propensity score and created matched pairs. In
the 2 logistic regression models, we included the same
variables including age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
hyperlipidemia,
ischemic
heart
disease,
stroke
history,
chronic kidney disease, heart failure, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, sleep apnea,
and the stroke severity index.
We then employed the Cox proportional hazard model to
estimate the unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and
95%CIs of discontinued and reduced statin therapy groups,
with the statin-maintained group as the reference group. The
model was adjusted for baseline age, sex, hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, stroke history,
chronic kidney disease, heart failure, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, sleep apnea,

 and stroke severity index. We also employed the Cox
proportional hazard model to estimate HRs and 95%CIs based
on propensity score matching between statin-discontinued
versus statin-maintained and statin-reduced versus statin-
maintained groups, respectively. We have also performed an
analysis in which the index date was the date of dose
reduction for the statin-reduced group and the date of
discontinuation for the statin-discontinued group.
We performed subgroup analyses stratified by risk factors
of stroke to assess whether these variables modified the
association between statin treatments and risk of stroke
recurrence. The subgroup analyses were prespecified, includ-
ing age, sex, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and stroke
severity, which were well-known risk factors and considered
of clinical importance. We used a severity index score to
classify patients into 3 groups of stroke severity: mild,
estimated National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 0 to 5;
moderate, estimated Stroke Scale 6 to 12; severe, estimated
Stroke Scale ≥13. We tested the significance of the
interaction terms in the regression models using the Wald
test for interactions.
The data were analyzed with SAS statistical software, V.9.4
(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). A 2-sided P<0.05 was consid-
ered to be statistically significant.
Results
Among the 45 151 ischemic stroke patients who received
moderate or high-intensity statin therapy for 90 days after
discharge, by the day-90 to day-180 period, 33 623 patients
(74.5%)
remained
on moderate or high-intensity
statin
therapy as the initial statin therapy, 3175 patents (7.0%)
were on reduced statin therapy, and 8353 patients (18.5%)
were not on any statin therapy (Figure 1). Table 2 shows the

 stroke, heart failure, and stroke severity index varied among
the 3 groups. Potential complications that could lead to
statin discontinuation or reduction were not different among
the 3 groups. Propensity score matching generated patients
with similar baseline characteristics in statin-maintained
versus statin-reduced therapy, and statin-maintained versus
statin-discontinued
therapy,
respectively,
as
shown
in
Table 3.
There were 2120 recurrent strokes during the 1-year
follow-up period based on the analysis from whole cohort.
Table 4 shows the impact of statin-reduced therapy and statin
discontinuation on recurrent vascular events and other clinical
end points. In multivariable analyses, compared with statin-
maintained therapy, discontinuation of statins was associated
with an increased hazard of recurrent ischemic or hemor-
rhagic stroke (6.2% versus 4.4%, adjusted HR 1.42, 95%CI
1.28-1.57, P<0.0001), whereas statin-reduced therapy was
not associated with an additional risk (4.1% versus 4.4%,
adjusted HR 0.94, 95%CI 0.78-1.12, P=0.47). Discontinuation
of statins was also linked to higher risks of ischemic stroke
(5.6% versus 3.9%, adjusted HR 1.45, 95%CI 1.30-1.61,
P<0.0001), all-cause mortality (1.4% versus 1.0%, adjusted HR
1.37, 95%CI 1.11-1.70, P=0.003), all major events (7.8%
versus 5.6%, adjusted HR 1.38, 95%CI 1.26-1.51, P<0.0001),
and any hospitalization (31.7% versus 27.1%, adjusted HR
1.19, 95%CI 1.14-1.24, P<0.0001) but had neutral effects on
intracerebral hemorrhage (0.6% versus 0.5%, adjusted HR
1.19, 95%CI 0.86-1.64, P=0.30) and myocardial infarction

 (0.5% versus 0.5%, adjusted HR 0.96, 95%CI 0.68-1.35,
P=0.80). Statin-reduced therapy was not associated with
increased risks of ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage,
all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or all major events.
Results from propensity score matching comparing statin-
maintained versus statin-discontinued, and statin-maintained
versus statin-reduced, respectively, were similar to the results
from an original cohort (Table 5). We performed an analysis in
which the index date was the date of dose reduction for the
statin-reduced group and the date of discontinuation for the
statin-discontinued
group
and
obtained
similar
results
(Table 6).
In subgroup analyses based on a propensity score–
matching data set, there was no interaction between most
baseline characteristics by the day-90 to day-180 time period
statin utilization status except that a detrimental effect of
statin discontinuation was noted mostly in patients with minor
stroke severity (Figure 2).
Discussion
The primary finding of this analysis is that discontinuation of
statin treatment beyond the first 3 months after an index
ischemic stroke was associated with increased risk of

 recurrent stroke and all-cause mortality at 1 year after statin
discontinuation. Among the one fifth of patients who did
discontinue statin therapy in the 3- to 6-month period, the
risks of any recurrent stroke (mostly ischemic stroke),
increased by 42%, from 4.4% to 6.2% in the 6- to 18-month
period of discharge after an index ischemic stroke. Statin
discontinuation in the 3- to 6-month period was also
associated with a 37% relative risk increase in mortality in
the 6- to 18-month time window. On the other hand, a
reduction in the dose of statin therapy in the 3- to 6-month
period after an ischemic stroke did not affect recurrent stroke
or all-cause mortality rates.

Statin Discontinuation and Recurrent Stroke

ORIGINAL RESEARCH

 Our findings are consistent with, and further extend, results
of a meta-analysis that revealed higher risks of cardiovascular
events and mortality among individuals with poor statin
adherence.9 Reasons for statin discontinuation in the current
study might be different from those in most prior studies.
Potential complications of statin, such as myalgia, rhabdomy-
olysis, memory/cognitive impairment, and increased liver
enzymes, were not different among statin utilization groups
and were unlikely to have contributed to discontinuation or
reducing intensity of statin therapy. High-intensity statin use
(SPARCL [Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in
Cholesterol Levels] study)2 and moderate-intensity statin use
(post hoc analyses of the HPS [Heart Protection Study])10 have
been associated with a reduction in vascular events after
stroke, and we are unaware of published data examining the link
between low-intensity statin use and reduced recurrent vascu-
lar events after stroke. Nonetheless, we speculated that
because both the high-intensity statin used in SPARCL2 and
moderate-intensity statin used in HPS10 were prescribed over
5-year follow-up periods, that the follow-up period in our study
(around 1 year) may have been too short to detect a clinically
significant difference between high/moderate-intensity statin
versus maintained yet reduced-intensity statin dose.
Patients who may have been poorly adherent to overall
medical instructions or too sick to comply were likely to have
been very few in this study cohort because we purposely
excluded patients who discontinued the cornerstone of the
recurrent stroke preventive regimen, antithrombotic therapy,

 from our analyses. As a result, the potential for bias arising from
the “healthy user” effect was curtailed in the current study.
Using compliance to concomitant therapies to control for the
healthy user effect is an established approach in analysis of
administrative data sets.11 Reinforcing the notion that the
patients stopping statins were not systematically sicker than
patients continuing statins was the observation that there were
no major differences in the baseline characteristics between
the groups, including no differences in the rates of receipt of
another key concomitant therapy, antihypertensive agents.
Statin discontinuation was unlikely to be due to cost concerns
because the National Health Insurance in Taiwan covers all
medication costs for eligible patients. However, the Taiwan
National Health Bureau during the study period did recommend
that physicians should consider stopping statins or reducing
statin dosage once LDL-cholesterol <100 mg/dL or total
cholesterol <160 mg/dL was achieved in a stroke patient, and
this recommendation might have contributed to the discontin-
uation of statin in some stroke patients.
Our findings also confirm and build on prior studies of
statin discontinuation in patients with ischemic stroke. A
randomized trial found that discontinuation of statins in the
acute poststroke period, within 3 days after onset, was
associated
with
increased
death
or
dependency
at
90 days.12 The current study found adverse effects in
patients who did continue statins through the acute period
but then were no longer on the therapy more than
3 months after onset. A single-center study found increased
mortality among patients stopping statins in the first year

 after stroke.6 Our study affirms the deleterious effect of
stopping statins after the initial period following a stroke
but does so in a population 30-fold larger, demonstrates
increased risk of recurrent stroke, and controls more
rigorously for the healthy-user effect.
Several mechanisms may explain a harmful effect of statin
discontinuation. Statins stabilize plaques in arteries supplying
brain and heart, reducing the risk of recurrent cerebral
infarction and coronary artery disease–related events.13 Also,
statin cessation has been associated with reduced flow-
mediated vasodilation, increased atrial fibrillation, and ele-
vated C-reactive protein serum levels.14-16
The observation in this study that patients had similar rates
of intracerebral hemorrhage among different groups of statin
therapy during 1-year follow-up is consistent with prior
studies. Studies have found that use of statins is associated
with neutral effect on risk of intracerebral hemorrhage in
persons without prior ischemic stroke,1 neutral effect on early
hemorrhagic transformation of acute ischemic stroke,17-19
and neutral or increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage
when used for long-term secondary prevention after an
ischemic stroke.1,20,21 An observational study based on
Taiwan NHIRD showed no association between statin use
and the risk of intracranial hemorrhage among subjects
without a previous history of stroke.22
Our study has both clinical and policy implications.

 index ischemic stroke. After a stroke due to large or small
vessel atherosclerosis, patients are at high risk of recurrent
stroke and should be treated aggressively in the absence of
clear contraindications. Physicians also need to increase
awareness among stroke patients about the potential risk of
discontinuing their medications and to encourage greater
adherence. It has been shown that statin-related side effects
often lead to statin discontinuation, but most patients who
initially experience statin-provoked symptoms can actually
tolerate statins in the long term by either taking a lower
dose or by switching to a different statin type. Symptoms
occurring while on a statin may not necessarily be related to
its use, may eventually be tolerated by the patient, may not
recur with a rechallenge, or may be specific to individual
statins rather than the entire drug class.23 Ideally, discon-
tinuation of statin treatment in patients with ischemic stroke
of large- or small-vessel atherosclerotic origin taking statin
who have reached a target LDL-cholesterol goal should be
strongly discouraged. Our study indicated that shifting
to low-intensity statin therapy did not increase recurrent
stroke risk and could be an alternative choice for stroke
patients not able to receive moderate or high-intensity statin
therapy.
This study has limitations inherent to studies of admin-
istrative data sets. First, LDL-cholesterol values over time
are important because achieved cholesterol could influence
both the decision to discontinue/reduce dose and long-
term outcomes. However, such information was not avail-
able in the Taiwan NHIRD, and we were unable to know
exactly whether it potentially biased our results. Second,
this is a retrospective study, and not all possible con-
founders may have been adjusted. Because statin therapy
is a proven strategy for secondary stroke prevention,2 it
would be unethical to assign certain stroke patients to
discontinue their statin therapy. Still, we conducted a
propensity core matching analysis, which likely minimized
differences of baseline characteristics among statin utiliza-
tion groups. Third, it was possible that a few patients may
have received medications without filing a medication claim,
and such data were not captured by Taiwan NHIRD.
However, because medication fees are typically covered by
national insurance in Taiwan, the numbers of patients who
might have done this was likely negligible. Fourth, the
current database did not provide information on whether a
recurrent stroke was related to a medical procedure or
occurred during a hospitalization for a non-stroke-related
problem.
In conclusion, this nationwide study evaluated outcomes in
poststroke patients among whom one-fifth discontinued the
use of prescribed statin therapy 3 to 6 months after
discharge for an ischemic stroke, although they continued
to
receive
other
standard
secondary
stroke-prevention
therapies such as antithrombotic agents. Stroke patients no
longer on statins beyond the initial period following their index
event had increased rates of recurrent stroke and death
during the first year after statin discontinuation. These
findings suggest that providers and atherosclerotic stroke
patients should not discontinue statin therapy unless there is
a highly compelling reason for doing so. Additional prospec-
tive studies should be carried out to clarify the underlying
mechanisms, such as LDL-cholesterol rebound and/or inflam-
mation, linking statin discontinuation to higher risk of
recurrent stroke.
