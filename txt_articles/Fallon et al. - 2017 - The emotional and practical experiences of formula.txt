Abstract 
The majority of infant-feeding research is focused on identifying mother’s reasons for the 
cessation of breastfeeding.  The experience of mothers who choose to use formula is largely 
overlooked in quantitative designs.  This study aimed to describe the emotional and practical 
experiences of mothers who formula feed in any quantity and examine whether these 
experiences would vary among different cohorts of formula feeding mothers according to 
prenatal feeding intention and postnatal feeding method.  A total of 890 mothers of infants up 
to 26 weeks of age, who were currently formula feeding in any quantity, were recruited 
through relevant international social media sites via advertisements providing a link to an 
online survey.  Predictors of emotional experiences included guilt, stigma, satisfaction, and 
defence as a result of their infant feeding choices. Practical predictor variables included 
support received from health professionals, respect displayed by their everyday environment, 
and main sources of infant feeding information.  Descriptive findings from the overall sample 
highlighted a worryingly high percentage of mother’s experienced negative emotions as a 
result of their decision to use formula. Multinomial logit models revealed that negative 
emotions such as guilt, dissatisfaction, and stigma were directly associated with feeding 
intention and method.  The evidence suggests that the current approach to infant-feeding 
promotion and support may be paradoxically related to significant issues with emotional 
wellbeing.  These findings support criticisms of how infant-feeding recommendations are 
framed by health care professionals and policy makers and highlight a need to address 
formula feeding in a more balanced, woman-centred manner.

Key Messages 
A high percentage of mothers experienced negative emotions including guilt (67%), stigma 
(68%), and the need to defend their decision (76%) to use formula.   
Mothers who had intentions to exclusively breastfeed in pregnancy (I-EBF) or those who 
exclusively formula fed at the time of study, yet initiated breastfeeding in accordance with 
current guidelines (EBF now EFF), were at a significantly higher risk of experiencing guilt 
and dissatisfaction as a  result of their feeding method 
 2 
 
Those that intended to exclusively formula feed in pregnancy (I-EFF) and initiated exclusive 
formula feeding from birth (EFF) were at a higher risk of experiencing stigma as a result of 
their feeding method  
The study suggests that the current approach to infant feeding promotion and support in 
higher-income countries may be paradoxically related to significant issues with emotional 
wellbeing.   
The emotional and practical experiences of formula feeding mothers 
Introduction 
Breastfeeding has unanimously positive short and long term health benefits for both mother 
and infant (Kramer & Kakuma 2012) and these effects are enhanced with the exclusivity and 
duration of breastfeeding (Ip et al. 2007).  The World Health Organisation [WHO] 
recommend exclusive breastfeeding up to six months of age, with continued breastfeeding up 
to two years of age or beyond (WHO, 2015).  To achieve this goal, a wide variety of pro-
breastfeeding initiatives and campaigns have been developed to promote the commonly 
affirmed “breast is best” message.  The dominant infant feeding discourse emphasises not 
only the nutritional benefits of human milk, but also stresses the advantages of breastfeeding 
from environmental, economic, feminist, and attachment perspectives (Lee 2007; Knaak 
2010).  This multidisciplinary belief in the superiority of breastfeeding has been widely 
disseminated among the lay population and the way mothers feed their babies has become a 
matter of international social and public interest (Murphy 1999; Lee 2007) . However, despite 
growing evidence for the positive impact of breastfeeding promotion on breastfeeding 
outcomes (Semenic et al. 2012), differences in breastfeeding initiation and continuation rates 
persist (WHO, 2012).  In many developed countries achieving the WHO recommendation 
remains a challenge.  For example, despite UK breastfeeding initiation rates increasing by 
 3 
 
19% since 1990 (62% in 1990 - 81% in 2010), the latest infant Feeding Survey [IFS] revealed 
that only 1% of UK mothers are exclusively breastfeeding their infants up to the 
recommended six months juncture (McAndrew et al., 2012).  Sub-optimal exclusive 
breastfeeding statistics can also be observed in the United States (16%), Canada (25%), and 
Australia (15%) leaving the vast majority of babies in developed countries receiving some 
formula milk in the first six months of life (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2011; 
Health Canada 2011; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2015; Mcandrew et al. 
2012).  A small percentage (up to 2%) of mothers are physically unable to breastfeed due to 
biological problems such as hypoplasia, breast abnormalities, prior surgery or other medical 
contraindications (Brown et al. 2011).  However, in the majority of cases the introduction of 
formula is related to breastfeeding management rather than biological issues (Neifert & 
Bunik 2013). 
A growing body of literature highlights some of the more problematic aspects of the 
dominant breastfeeding discourse (Lagan et al. 2014; Knaak 2010; Williams et al. 2012; 
Murphy 1999; Knaak 2006; Lee 2007).  While breastfeeding promotion is fundamentally a 
medical based discourse with the objective of conveying the health benefits of breastfeeding, 
it subliminally situates breastfeeding as the appropriate and “moral” choice (Knaak 2010).  
Given the widespread knowledge of the many merits of breastfeeding among mothers, the 
moral statuses of those who decide not to breastfeed, or who are unable to, are left in 
jeopardy (Murphy 1999; Spencer et al. 2015).  Assuming that every new parent desires the 
“best” for their infant, the “breast is best” slogan becomes a profoundly moralistic message, 
rather than a promotional tool to simplify the scientific evidence about the benefits of 
breastfeeding.  This is amplified further by expert claims about the “riskiness” of choosing 
formula (Lee 2007).  In this manner, the pro-breastfeeding discourse has become intertwined 
with broader ideologies of the concept of optimal parenting (Lee 2007; Knaak 2010).  This 
 4 
 
can lead to considerable pressure to conform to infant feeding guidelines in pregnancy and an 
emotional burden for those who do not manage to adhere to current recommendations in the 
postnatal period.    
This discursive trend has also guided research protocols with a predominance of infant 
feeding research  focused on identifying mother’s reasons for the cessation of breastfeeding 
(Lakshman et al. 2009).   While this is important in informing breastfeeding interventions, the 
lived experience of mothers who choose to use formula in a context where breastfeeding is 
strongly advocated has been largely overlooked (Knaak 2006).  The limited evidence which 
examines mothers who formula feed from this perspective does however raise important 
socio-cultural concerns which extend beyond those about health and nutrition (Lee 2007; 
Murphy 1999; Bailey et al. 2004; Mozingo et al. 2000; Knaak 2010). A mixed methods 
systematic review by Lakshman et al. in 2009 effectively synthesises the available evidence.  
Two key themes were identified among only 23 studies examining mother’s experiences of 
formula feeding; maternal emotions; and perceptions of support. Negative feelings of guilt, 
stigma, and dissatisfaction were highlighted in all of the qualitative studies examining the 
emotional experiences of formula feeding women (Bailey et al. 2004; Cloherty et al. 2004; 
Lee 2007; Mozingo et al. 2000; Earle 2000; Cairney et al. 2006; Spencer et al. 2015).  In 
some of the studies, these feelings were internally motivated by an awareness of the 
superiority of breastfeeding (Lee 2007; Cloherty et al. 2004; Bailey et al. 2004) and appeared 
to be more pronounced when formula feeding was not intended in pregnancy (Lakshman et 
al. 2009).  Lee (2007) describes this intention-behaviour incongruence as one of “moral 
collapse” (p. 1087) which refers to women who have strong intentions to breastfeed in 
pregnancy and experience negative emotions as a result of being unable to in the postnatal 
period.  However, in other studies, an allegedly unreasonable pressure to breastfeed from 
external sources, namely health professionals, emerged as the emotional catalyst (Lee 2007; 
 5 
 
Mozingo et al. 2000; Earle 2000; Lagan et al. 2014; Spencer et al. 2015).  A perceived 
emphasis on the promotion of breastfeeding starting in pregnancy functioned as a vehicle of 
persuasion, rather than a vehicle of education, and alienated those who had chosen to formula 
feed (Lakshman et al. 2009).  Mothers who initiate breastfeeding and then move to formula 
appear to be particularly susceptible to feelings of distress  as a result of failing to conform to 
the “breast is best” message (Lagan et al. 2014).  It has also been reported that these women 
experience a lack of support and information from health professionals concerning formula 
feeding (Lagan et al. 2014; Lakshman et al. 2009). Support and information is instead found 
to be heavily slanted towards breastfeeding, which again, reinforces the supremacy of the 
pro-breastfeeding discourse (Cairney et al. 2006; Furber & Thomson 2006; Lagan et al. 
2014).  To foster appropriate infant feeding intentions, the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative 
(BFHI) code on infant feeding discourages health professionals from actively disseminating 
formula feeding information antenatally (UNICEF, 2010).  However, this policy is often 
misinterpreted.  Findings from two qualitative studies in the UK highlight that midwives in 
Baby-Friendly settings erroneously failed to provide support to formula feeding mothers in 
the postnatal period because they believed they were prohibited by BFHI policy (Furber & 
Thomson 2006; Lagan et al. 2014).  Consistent with this, mothers report a perceived 
reluctance by health professionals to provide advice about formula feeding postnatally (Lee 
2007; Lagan et al. 2014).   
Compared with the large literature on breastfeeding and despite the high percentage of infants 
receiving formula (McAndrew et al., 2012) and the potentially grave consequences for 
maternal and infant health and wellbeing arising from negative feeding experiences, there is 
very limited evidence regarding the opinions and experiences of formula feeding mothers. 
Previous qualitative studies have only explored emotional experiences; while the quantitative 
studies primarily describe perceptions of information and support (see review by Lakshman 
 6 
 
et al., 2009).  To our knowledge, no study has explored emotional and practical factors 
simultaneously nor quantified them in a large sample.  Specifically, the aims of the current 
large scale internet study were to i) describe experiences of infant feeding support, 
information, respect, stigma, guilt, satisfaction, and defence in mothers who use formula in 
any quantity; ii) examine whether these experiences would vary among different cohorts of 
formula feeding mothers, and iii) examine whether these experiences would differ according 
to feeding intention in pregnancy. It was predicted that formula feeding mothers who planned 
to follow current breastfeeding guidelines in pregnancy, would perceive their infant feeding 
experiences more negatively than those who intended to formula feed in any quantity. 
Furthermore, mothers who exclusively formula feed at the time of study, yet initiated 
breastfeeding in accordance with current guidelines were predicted to perceive their infant 
feeding experiences more negatively than other cohorts of formula feeding mothers.    
Method 
Participants and Recruitment 
A total of 890 mothers of infants up to 26 weeks of age, who were currently formula feeding 
in any quantity, were recruited through relevant social media sites and mailing lists via 
advertisements providing a link to the Qualtrics survey software. The 26 weeks cut off point 
applied reflects the current WHO infant feeding recommendations (WHO, 2015).  The 
advertisements stated that participants were invited to take part in a short study which would 
examine the opinions and experiences of formula feeding mothers.  Women who were 
exclusively breastfeeding, younger than 18 years of age, or non-English-speaking, were not 
eligible to participate.  Of the 890 participants, 289 (32%) were excluded from final analyses 
as they did not complete the full survey. The age of the final sample of 601 mothers ranged 
from 18 to 46 years (M = 29.44; SD = 5.65).  Their babies’ ages ranged from 1 to 26 weeks 
 7 
 
(M = 17.96; SD = 7.38).  The sample were predominately married (64%), primiparous (62%) 
women from the United Kingdom (57%).  Fifty-six percent of the sample intended to 
exclusively breastfeed which is comparable with UK breastfeeding data (Mcandrew et al. 
2012).  Forty six percent of the sample initiated exclusive breastfeeding but were exclusively 
formula feeding at the time of study.  See Table 1 for full demographic details. The study 
gained ethical approval from the University of Liverpool Institute of Psychology, Health and 
Society Ethics Committee in January 2015. All aspects of the study were performed in 
accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Participants were provided with an 
information sheet and informed consent was gained with a tick box. The online survey was 
accessible from 30/1/2015 to 3/3/2015.  
The Survey 
Demographics 
Mothers were initially asked demographic questions relating to their age, marital status, and 
country of residence. To assess socio-economic status participants were asked to report their 
current occupation (or if currently on maternity leave, previous occupation). The simplified 
National Statistics Socio-economic Classification, which contains 8 occupation 
classifications was then applied (Office for National Statistics n.d.). Demographic 
information (birth order and age in weeks) relating to the infant was also obtained. 
  
Exposure Variables 
The exposure variables were developed from exploratory qualitative work which examined 
the infant feeding experiences of a sample of 19 postpartum women at two time points (4-8 
weeks and 12-16 weeks).  The data revealed various themes relating to emotional and 
practical infant feeding experiences which were consistent with the qualitative literature 
 8 
 
highlighted in the introduction and were used to generate survey items.  Basic face and 
content validation were conducted on the items.  The survey was reviewed and revised by all 
members of the research team with the following characteristics in mind:  1) simplicity and 
viability 2) reliability and precision in item wording 3) adequacy of the experience that it was 
intended to measure 4) reflection of the underlying concept that was measured.  See Table 2 
for a breakdown of items in the order that they were displayed to participants. 
The first part of the survey assessed the perceived level of infant feeding support that mothers   
received from health professionals, the perceived level of respect displayed by their everyday 
environment with regards to their feeding choices, and the perceived level of satisfaction 
experienced as a result of their feeding choices.  All answers were provided via a 5 point 
Likert-scale (higher responses indicated higher levels of support, respect, and satisfaction). 
Mothers were also asked about their main source of information about infant feeding. 
Potential responses included the internet, health professionals, family members, other 
mothers, the media, or previous experiences/own accord.   
In the second part of the survey mothers were asked to provide a binary (yes/ no) response to 
indicate the presence of feelings of guilt, stigma and the need to defend as a result their infant 
feeding choices. Display-logic was embedded in the survey software so that only participants 
with a positive response to these items were provided with a further item which examined the 
source of the feelings (potential options included the internet, health professionals, family 
members, other mothers, the media, or previous experiences/own accord).  Participants were 
able to choose more than one source if applicable.  A positive response to the presence of 
guilt was also followed up using display-logic to ascertain whether the feelings were 
experienced internally, as a result of other’s opinions, or both.  Experiencing guilt internally 
is not dependent on other’s knowing about one’s behaviour (in this case feeding 
 9 
 
intention/type) for it to arise. Conversely, experiencing guilt as a result of other’s opinions is 
linked to public evaluation and is imposed on you by someone else. 
Outcome Variables  
The outcome variables, current feeding type and feeding intention in pregnancy were 
independently ascertained.  Available answers were based on WHO-defined categories 
(WHO, 2002).  Six different categories were available to the mothers (exclusively formula 
feeding from birth; breastfeeding to begin with but now a little formula; breastfeeding to 
begin with but now some formula; breastfeeding to begin with but now mostly formula; 
exclusively breastfeeding to begin with but now exclusively formula feeding; and 
combination feeding from birth).  
Feeding intention was asked retrospectively at the end of the study to avoid response bias on 
answers relating to guilt, stigma or the need to defend infant feeding choices. Five choices 
were available to the mothers (exclusively breastfeeding, mostly breastfeeding with some 
formula, approximately 50% breastfeeding and 50% formula feeding, mainly formula feeding 
with some breastfeeding and exclusively formula feeding).   
Statistical analysis 
All analysis was conducted using the IBM SPSS 22 software package. Due to unexpected 
singularities (empty cells in the cross-tabulations) occurring during statistical analysis both 
outcome variables (current feeding type and feeding intention) were collapsed into three 
categories.  Current feeding type: exclusively formula feeding from birth (EFF); exclusively 
breastfeeding to start with but now exclusively formula feeding (EBF now EFF); and all other 
types of combination feeding (combi) and feeding intention: exclusively breastfeeding [I-
EBF]; any type of combination feeding [I-combi] and exclusively formula feeding [I-EFF].  
 10 
 
Descriptive statistics were generated for demographic and exposure variables of interest 
(Tables 2 and 3).  One way ANOVA and 2 tests were used to examine bivariate associations 
between study variables and both feeding type, and feeding intention (Table 3).  Relative risk 
ratio’s (RRRs) for the association between exposure (emotional and practical variables) and 
outcome variables (feeding type and feeding intention) were then calculated using 
multinomial logit models.  These include two sets of referent categories, one for the exposure 
category and one for the outcome category.  Separate models were built for feeding type and 
feeding intention.  The referent outcome category was set to reflect the hypotheses (i.e. 
feeding type: exclusive breastfeeding but now exclusively formula feeding; feeding intention; 
exclusive breastfeeding).  Backward elimination was used to build the adjusted models and 
demographic variables were kept as confounders in the model if they changed the beta 
coefficients of the exposure categories by more than 10%. Feeding intention and feeding type 
were also included as potential confounders in the opposing models.  When necessary 
exposure categories were collapsed (as described above) to meet the requirements of the 
statistical test and overcome complete separation issues within the sample (see Tables 4 and 
5). 
Results 
Overall Sample 
Of the 601 mothers, the majority experienced feelings of guilt (67%) about their choice of 
feeding method (Table 3).  Interestingly, guilt was more likely to be internally motivated 
(30%) than stem from external sources (12%), although many experienced it from both 
channels (55%).  Similar statistics were observed for other negative emotions with 68% of 
the sample experiencing feelings of stigma and a large majority (76%) of the sample 
experiencing the need to defend their choice of feeding method.  External sources of guilt, 
 11 
 
stigma, and defence were primarily perceived to come from other mothers in similar 
quantities (68%, 62%, and 69% respectively), although this was closely followed by health 
professionals (64%, 59%, and 58% respectively).  Despite these experiences, the majority 
(67%) of mothers responded that they were satisfied with their feeding method with a much 
lesser proportion (17%) reporting feelings of dissatisfaction.  Similarly, the majority (62%) of 
mothers indicated that they felt respected, rather than disrespected (14%) in their everyday 
environment in terms of their infant feeding choices.   
Thirty six percent of the sample felt well supported by health professionals about their choice 
of feeding method.  This left the majority of mothers experiencing low to moderate levels of 
infant feeding support (64%) from health professionals.  This was echoed in the descriptive 
statistics regarding infant feeding information.  The internet was favoured above health 
professionals as a source of infant feeding information among the sample with one in three 
mothers (31%) choosing this option.  Remarkably, mothers were almost equally likely to gain 
information from health professionals (23%) as they were to use their own accord (22%).  
Associations by feeding type 
Descriptive statistics for all predictor variables split by feeding type can be found in Table 3.  
Forty six percent of the mothers who were exclusively formula feeding at the time of study 
initiated breastfeeding in accordance with current guidelines (EBF now EFF).  EBF now EFF 
mothers were more likely to be married (p<.001) than exclusive formula feeding (EFF) 
mothers and mother who were combination feeding in any quantity (combi).  EFF mothers 
were significantly younger than EBF now EFF mothers and combi mothers (p=.001).  There 
were no differences in infant age, birth order, or occupational status between groups (Table 
1). 
 12 
 
Crude multinomial regression revealed that for those who experienced guilt as a result of 
their feeding method, the relative risk for being in the EFF group was four times lower in 
relation to EBF now EFF mothers and two times lower in combination feeding mothers when 
compared to EBF now EFF mothers (Table 4).  After adjusting for maternal age, marital 
status, and feeding intention, the effect estimate for the EFF/EBF now EFF comparison was 
attenuated but the relative risk was still much lower (RRR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.79).  
Adjustment for covariates actually lowered the effect estimate further in the combi/EBF now 
EFF comparison (RRR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.64).  Conversely, for those experiencing 
stigma as a result of their feeding method, the relative risk for being in the EFF group was 
much higher when compared to EBF now EFF mothers (RRR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.04, 3.41).  
However, in adjusted analyses, this association was no longer significant. No associations 
between groups were observed with respect to defence.   
In crude models, for those who experienced dissatisfaction or neutrality as a result of their 
feeding method, the relative risk of being in the EFF group was almost three times lower 
(RRR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.77; RRR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.85) when compared to EBF 
now EFF mothers.  However, for those experiencing dissatisfaction and neutrality, a contrary 
association occurred when comparing combi/EBF now EFF groups (RRR: 1.78; 95% CI: 
1.04, 3.06; RRR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.01, 2.91).  Neither of these associations were significant in 
adjusted models.   
There were no differences in levels of respect or support between groups.  However, one 
association was present when examining sources of information.  Interestingly, in both crude 
(RRR: 2.99; 95% CI: 1.38, 6.51) and adjusted models (RRR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.16, 6.44), for 
those that used family members over health professionals as their source of infant feeding 
information, the relative risk for being in the EFF group was three times higher when 
compared to EBF now EFF mothers.    
 13 
 
Associations by feeding intention 
Descriptive statistics for all predictor variables split by feeding intention can be found in 
Table 3.  More than half of the mothers (56% of 601) intended to exclusively breastfeed their 
baby in pregnancy (I-EBF).  These mothers were more likely to be primiparous (p<.001) than 
those who planned to exclusively formula feed (I-EFF) or combination feed in any quantity 
(I-combi) (Table 3).  Crude multinomial regression revealed that for those experiencing guilt, 
the relative risk for being in the I-EFF group was seven times lower when compared to I-EBF 
mothers (RRR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.26) and two times lower for I-combi mothers when 
compared to I-EBF mothers (RRR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.79).  Adjustment for maternal age, 
birth order, and feeding type lowered the relative risk further (RRR: 0.13, 95% CI:  0.06, 
0.28; RRR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.78 respectively).  Conversely, for those experiencing 
stigma, the relative risk for being in the I-EFF group was 2.6 times higher than those in the I-
EBF group (RRR: 2.63; 95% CI: 1.31, 5,27) and 1.7 times higher in the I-combi group (RRR: 
1.75; 95% CI: 1.03, 2.96) than those in the I-EBF group.  Neither association remained 
significant in adjusted models.  Again, no associations between groups were observed with 
respect to defence.   
Although this finding was as hypothesised, the relative risk of being in the I-EFF group rather 
than the I-EBF group was 14 times lower for those experiencing dissatisfaction (RRR: 0.07; 
95% CI: 0.02, 0.30).  The risk was also four times lower when comparing I-combi/I-EBF 
mothers (RRR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.49).  In adjusted models the associations were 
attenuated but remained strong (Table 5).  However,  in adjusted models, for those 
experiencing disrespect from their everyday environment, the relative risk of being in the I-
EFF group was three times higher (RRR: 3.25; 95% CI: 1.12; 9.38) than I-EBF mothers.  No 
differences in levels of support were observed between groups.  However, when examining 
sources of information, for those that used family members and their own accord over health 
 14 
 
professionals (RRR: 2.50; 95% CI: 1.04, 6.02; RRR: 3.78; 95% CI: 1.74, 8.21 respectively), 
the relative risk of being in the I-EFF group was higher than the risk of being in the I-EBF 
group.  The same pattern was observed in the I-combi/I-EBF comparison (RRR: 2.51; 95% 
CI: 1.35, 4.68).  Again, no associations for infant feeding information remained significant in 
adjusted models.   
 
Discussion 
Given the limited evidence base in quantitative designs, the first aim of this study was to 
examine the emotional and practical experiences of mothers who use formula in any quantity.  
Descriptive findings from the overall sample indicate that despite feeling satisfied and well 
respected; a high percentage of mothers experienced negative emotions including guilt 
(67%), stigma (68%), and the need to defend their decision (76%) to use formula.  This is the 
first study to provide numerical evidence to support qualitative research (Bailey et al. 2004; 
Cloherty et al. 2004; Lee 2007; Mozingo et al. 2000; Earle 2000; Cairney et al. 2006) and 
quantify the highly pervasive nature of negative emotions occurring among formula feeding 
women.  Eighty-eight percent of women are using some quantity of formula in the first six 
months of life (McAndrew et al. 2012).  These findings indicate a widespread public health 
issue that requires urgent attention from infant feeding policy makers in order to protect the 
emotional wellbeing of formula feeding mothers at an already precarious time.  Mood 
disturbances are more common postpartum as compared to prepartum or the rate that 
characterises women in the general population (O’Hara et al., 2012; Viguera et al., 2011; 
Wenzel, Haugen, Jackson, & Brendle, 2005).  Moreover, they are a precursor to more serious 
postnatal mood disorders and potentially deleterious maternal or infant health outcomes 
(Raes et al. 2014; Glasheen et al. 2010; Grace et al. 2003).  Undesirable emotions relating to 
infant feeding may exacerbate these relationships. 
 15 
 
Feelings of guilt were more likely to be internally motivated than stem from external sources.  
This is an interesting finding supporting previous literature that proposes an instinctive 
knowledge regarding the superiority of breastfeeding (Lee 2007; Cloherty et al. 2004; Bailey 
et al. 2004) and indicates that self-reproach is the likely consequence of a discordant infant 
feeding outcome.  With regards to external emotional catalysts, the data followed a similar 
pattern for guilt, stigma, and the need to defend feeding method.  The primary external source 
of all the emotions under study was other mothers.  Although this is a novel finding in the 
infant feeding literature, the media-fuelled “mummy-wars” between breastfeeding and 
formula feeding mothers may be a contributing factor (Christopher & Krell 2014).  Informal 
relationships between mothers both face to face, and via social media platforms are an 
important source of social and emotional support (Lee 2007; Zimmerman et al. 2008) and the 
socio-cultural significance of infant feeding decisions may be placing these networks in 
jeopardy (Christopher & Krell 2014). 
These negative emotions were secondarily driven by health professionals. These feelings may 
occur as a result of not conforming to health professionals’ recommendations or stem from a 
perception that health professionals judge formula to be an inferior option (Lagan et al. 2014; 
Spencer et al. 2015).  Such conclusions are further reinforced by data revealing that the 
majority of mothers in this study felt unsupported by health professionals and were more 
likely to rely on the internet for infant feeding information than seek advice from them.  
Although it is acknowledged that the vast majority of health professionals strive to promote 
and support the health and well-being of mothers and their infants, a perceived lack of infant 
feeding support and information from commissioned health services may result in errors in 
the preparation, handling, and storage of formula.  These mistakes were noted in a number of 
studies reviewed by Lakshman (2009) and such consistencies in the literature raise 
considerable implications for infant health.  Inadequate conditions when handling formula 
 16 
 
milk may lead to inadequate or excessive intake of calories and nutrients, dehydration, and 
diarrhoea.   Moreover, there is a high risk of infection if bottles are washed or diluted with 
water at incorrect temperatures or stored inappropriately (Labiner-Wolfe et al. 2008; 
Lakshman et al. 2009). 
The secondary aims of this work were to assess whether these experiences varied according 
to prenatal feeding intention and postnatal feeding type.  Specifically, it was predicted that 
formula feeding mothers who had intentions to exclusively breastfeed in pregnancy (I-EBF) 
or those who exclusively formula fed at the time of study, yet initiated breastfeeding in 
accordance with current guidelines (EBF now EFF), would have more negative experiences 
than the other groups under study.  Regression analyses revealed that both I-EBF and EBF 
now EFF type mothers were at a significantly higher risk of experiencing guilt about their 
choice of feeding method than other cohorts.  These associations remained strong after 
adjustment for a range of confounders and could be most clearly observed when mothers 
expressed intentions to exclusively breastfeed in pregnancy.  Guilt arises from the internal 
consciousness of an immoral action, this finding further exposes the moralistic nature of the 
pro-breastfeeding discourse (Murphy 1999; Lee 2007; Knaak 2010) and highlights the 
emotional costs for those who try, yet are unable to achieve the current WHO guidance of 
exclusive breastfeeding for six months  This guidance is intended to inform international 
government policies, but is instead widely disseminated by health professionals as an 
individual feeding goal for women (Hoddinott et al. 2013).  Others have suggested that this is 
an unachievable “one size fits all” approach which disregards individual women’s 
circumstances (Schmied et al. 2001; Lagan et al. 2014) and sets women up for failure 
(Hoddinott et al. 2013) 
Similarly, the findings revealed that both I-EBF and EBF now EFF type mothers were at a 
significantly higher risk of experiencing dissatisfaction about their choice of feeding method 
 17 
 
than other cohorts, although this result was not significant in adjusted models for feeding 
type.  Cultural representations of formula as nutritionally inferior, unsafe or risky have been 
highlighted as a contributors to feeding dissatisfaction (Lee 2007; Knaak 2010; Knaak 2006; 
Murphy 1999); these findings lend agreement to this body of qualitative work.  In addition, 
dissatisfaction with infant feeding has been associated with overall discontent about the initial 
postnatal period (Symon et al. 2013).  Several other studies have noted the emotional burden 
for those that intend to, and initially start breastfeeding in accordance with current policies, 
yet change to formula feeding early (Lagan et al. 2014; Schmied et al. 2001; Lee 2007).  
These findings provide quantitative evidence to support criticisms of how infant feeding 
recommendations are framed by policy makers and appeals for a less prescriptive approach to 
the way current guidelines are presented to women (Lee 2007; Knaak 2006; Lagan et al. 
2014).  Associations for both guilt and dissatisfaction were stronger in feeding intention 
analyses than feeding type analyses.  This suggests that the negative emotions experienced 
when prenatal exclusive breastfeeding expectations are unmet may be more profound than 
those experienced when exclusive breastfeeding is ceased in the postnatal period.  Although 
this is a novel finding, recent work has indicated that the psychological disappointment 
generated by unmet expectations leads to lower wellbeing and a higher risk of depressive 
symptoms in the postpartum (Gregory et al. 2015).  Others have also noted this mismatch 
between idealism and realism, suggesting that policy makers are encouraging idealistic 
expectations in pregnancy but failing to support women to achieve these goals after birth 
(Hoddinott et al. 2013; Lee 2007; Lagan et al. 2014). 
Contrary to the hypothesis, I-EFF and EFF mothers were at a higher risk of experiencing 
stigma as a result of their feeding method than other cohorts, although these associations 
were attenuated in adjusted models.  This suggests that mothers who intentionally use 
formula may be prone to a different, albeit undesirable, emotional experience.  Furthermore, 
 18 
 
these mothers were also more likely to rely on family members than health professionals for 
infant feeding information when compared to those who attempted to follow current 
breastfeeding recommendations.  Stigma is defined as a negative and widely held social 
belief about an undesirable behaviour (Goffman, 1963), and is highly associated with 
perceptions of social isolation (Link & Phelan 2006).  It is argued, that the highly prevalent 
“breast is best” mantra serves to alienate those who intend to exclusively formula feed and 
creates reluctance among women to seek professional advice about their “suboptimal” 
feeding method.  This finding resonates with other work highlighting feelings of isolation 
(Murphy 1999; Lee 2007)  and  information gaps in the current infant feeding message for 
those who decide to formula feed (Lagan et al. 2014; Knaak 2006; Knaak 2010).  The Royal 
College of Midwives (2004) advocates that women who choose to formula feed should have 
their decision respected.  Similarly, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (2008) 
guidelines emphasises that health professionals need to provide balanced and individualised 
information in discussions which encompass all infant feeding options.  Counterintuitively, 
BFHI policy continues to prohibit health professionals from providing antenatal formula 
feeding advice in pregnancy, even to those who express intentions to exclusively formula 
feed in pregnancy (UNICEF, 2010).  There may be a critical window of time for such 
conversations to take place to enhance perceptions of care and prevent negative maternal 
emotions from occurring prior to the postnatal period.  Furthermore, this will enable health 
professionals to promote the safe and appropriate use of formula prior to commencement of 
use.   
While the BFHI  message is critically important  in developing countries (Bartington et al. 
2006) or high-risk situations (prematurity, very low birth weight) (UNICEF 2013) where the 
relevance for child survival is undisputed, it may be internalised differently among affluent or 
low-risk populations.  The evidence presented here suggests that the current approach to 
 19 
 
infant feeding promotion and support in higher-income countries may be paradoxically 
related to significant issues with emotional wellbeing and may need to be situationally 
modified.  This is not an isolated finding (Lagan et al. 2014; Lee 2007; Knaak 2006; Spencer 
et al. 2015; Thomson & Dykes 2011; Schmied et al. 2011) and points to tensions with 
breastfeeding initiatives such as BFHI in their current form.  Exclusive breastfeeding rates are 
very low in some higher-income countries such as the UK and continue to stagnate 
(Mcandrew et al. 2012; Bolling et al. 2005).  At present, there is limited evidence examining 
the efficacy of public health interventions designed to increase rates of breastfeeding 
initiation and duration in higher-income settings.  Only two studies in the UK have been 
conducted in BFHI settings and both indicate that the benefits of the current strategy are 
transient and not sustained (Bartington et al. 2006; Broadfoot et al. 2005).  There is urgent 
need for further evaluation of current initiatives such as BFHI in higher-income settings to 
identify barriers to breastfeeding success and eliminate risks to maternal and infant 
wellbeing.   
These conclusions are reinforced by the present study’s large sample size which allowed 
assessment and adjustment of a range of established confounders while maintaining statistical 
power.  The study design allowed us to distinguish between the emotional and practical 
experiences of different groups of formula feeders and as such provides a rationale for 
support to be tailored to specific cohorts of women.  These experiences were however 
explored in a self-selected online sample of mothers.  It is possible that responses were biased 
towards those with extreme experiences as those who are neutral about the topic may have 
chosen not to participate.  For instance, mothers who wanted to breastfeed yet were unable to 
for biological reasons are likely to experience negative emotions as a result of diminished 
choice.  Feeding intention was assessed retrospectively which may have also increased the 
chance of response bias.  However, this is offset by the high levels of anonymity experienced 
 20 
 
when participating in online research.  The study sample was predominantly first time, 
married mothers from the UK which limits the generalizability of findings to other settings.  
Data from exclusively breastfeeding women were also not obtained and so comparisons 
cannot be made with those who successfully adhere to current recommendations; this may be 
an interesting avenue for future research.  The survey items used were not subject to 
comprehensive validity testing, again, this should be explored if the questions are to be used 
again with a different sample.   
To conclude, descriptive findings from the overall sample indicate widespread negative 
emotions among those who choose to formula feed in any quantity.  Although the hypotheses 
were only partially supported, this is the first study to identify that failure to initiate, or 
premature discontinuation of breastfeeding is directly associated with negative emotions, 
namely guilt and stigma.  Women who intended to exclusively breastfeed, or initiated 
exclusive breastfeeding were more susceptible to guilt, whereas those that intended to or 
initiated exclusively formula feeding were at greater risk of experiencing stigma.  As such, it 
exposes the specific emotional repercussions of formula feeding and provides further 
evidence to suggest that there is insufficient support and advice in place for those who use 
formula to feed their infants.  The findings quantitatively summarise a rich body of 
qualitative work which highlights a need to address formula feeding in a more balanced, 
woman-centred manner.  Such consistency in the literature provides a solid basis to inform 
large-scale trials and evaluations examining the efficacy of current infant feeding initiatives.  
Ultimately, it is imperative to determine whether the benefits of the current infant feeding 
message outweigh the apparent risks to maternal and infant wellbeing.
