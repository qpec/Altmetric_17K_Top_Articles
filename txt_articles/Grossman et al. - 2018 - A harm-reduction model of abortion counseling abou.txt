Abstract
Background
In Peru, abortion is legal only to preserve the life and health of the woman. A non-profit clinic
system in Peru implemented a harm-reduction model for women with unwanted pregnancy
that included pre-abortion care with instructions about misoprostol use and post-abortion
care; they started offering telephone follow-up for clients in 2011. This study aimed to evalu-
ate the effectiveness and safety of the harm-reduction model, and to compare outcomes by
type of follow-up obtained.
Methods
Between January 2012 and March 2013, 500 adult women seeking harm-reduction services
were recruited into the study. Telephone surveys were conducted approximately four weeks
after their initial harm-reduction counseling session with 262 women (response rate 52%); 9
participants were excluded. The survey focused on whether women pursued an abortion,
and if so, what their experience was. Demographic and clinical data were also extracted
from clinic records.
Results
Eighty-six percent of participants took misoprostol; among those taking misoprostol, 89%
reported a complete abortion at the time of the survey. Twenty-two percent obtained an
aspiration after taking misoprostol and 8% self-reported adverse events including hemor-
rhage without transfusion, infection, or severe pain. Among women who took misoprostol,
46% reported receiving in-person follow-up (in some cases both telephone and in-person),
34% received telephone only, and 20% did not report receiving any form of follow-up. Those

 who had in-person follow-up with the counselor were most likely to report a complete abor-
tion (<0.001). Satisfaction with both types of follow-up was very high, with 81%-89% report-
ing being very satisfied.
Conclusions
Liberalization of restrictive abortion laws is associated with improvements in health out-
comes, but the process of legal reform is often lengthy. In the interim, giving women informa-
tion about evidence-based regimens of misoprostol, as well as offering a range of follow-up
options to ensure high quality post-abortion care, may reduce the risks associated with
unsafe abortion.
Introduction
Abortion is legally restricted throughout most of Latin America, leading many women with
unwanted pregnancies to turn to clandestine or unsafe providers, or to attempt self-induction of
abortion using a variety of techniques, some of which may be unsafe or ineffective. The most
recent estimate of the annual incidence of abortion in South America is 47 per 1,000 women
aged 15–44; this rate has been stable since 1990 and is higher than the global abortion rate of 35
per 1,000 women [1]. Throughout Latin America, unsafe abortion is responsible for 10–20% of
maternal deaths [2]. In Peru, where abortion is legal only to preserve the life and health of the
woman, a large, population-based survey of women aged 18–29 found that 11.6% reported a
prior induced abortion [3]. Liberalizing abortion laws to allow for provision of safe, clinic-based
abortion care could lead to a reduction in abortion-related morbidity and mortality in the region.
In settings where mifepristone is not available, the World Health Organization recom-
mends a regimen of misoprostol alone in a dosage of 800 mcg administered vaginally or sub-
lingually, repeated up to three times at intervals of 3–12 hours to induce an abortion [4].
Misoprostol is a safer and more effective alternative to other forms of abortion self-induction
[5], and studies have documented widespread availability of the drug in Latin America [6–9].
Two modeling studies have demonstrated that replacement of unsafe abortion methods with
misoprostol could significantly improve health outcomes and reduce costs associated with
treating complications of unsafe abortion in Latin America [10, 11]. The decline in the rate of
serious complications from unsafe abortion in Peru has been attributed to misoprostol avail-
ability in the country [12], although studies have also demonstrated that pharmacy staff in
Latin America provide limited information about appropriate regimens of misoprostol [13,
14].
A risk- or harm-reduction approach to unsafe abortion has shown promise in Uruguay. In
response to high maternal mortality from unsafe abortion, the non-governmental organization
Iniciativas Sanitarias developed a program to ensure that women planning to have an abortion
outside of the mainstream health system have adequate counseling and care before and after
the procedure. The aim of this harm-reduction approach is to decrease the negative health
effects of unsafe abortion among particularly vulnerable populations [15]. The model asserts
that even in contexts where abortion is legally restricted, it is legal and appropriate for health
professionals to provide information and medical care to women before and after an illegal
abortion [15].
The Uruguay model, which was implemented before the law was changed in 2012 to allow
abortion on request in the first trimester, includes informing women with unintended

 pregnancies and no legal grounds for clinic-based induced abortion about the risks involved in
clandestine pregnancy termination, according to gestational age and method used. In particu-
lar, women are given information about the evidence indicating that appropriate doses of
misoprostol early in pregnancy may safely and effectively terminate an early pregnancy. The
objectives of the post-abortion follow-up visit are to identify medical complications and ongo-
ing pregnancy, as well as to provide emotional support and post-abortion contraception as
needed. Evaluation of the initial implementation of the program at the main maternity hospital
in Uruguay demonstrated that complications and deaths from unsafe abortion decreased dur-
ing the study period compared to previous years [15]. The evaluation also found that a high
proportion of women used misoprostol and returned for the follow-up visit, indicating that
women were receptive to the program [15].
A similar harm-reduction program was implemented at the Instituto Peruano de Paterni-
dad Responsable (INPPARES), a non-governmental sexual and reproductive health organiza-
tion that provides educational and clinical services for women and men in Peru. INPPARES
implemented the harm-reduction model in its largest clinic in Lima in 2006. The model has
since expanded to various clinic sites in Lima as well as a high-volume clinic in Chimbote, a
small town along the northwestern coast of Peru. Similar to the model in Uruguay, women at
INPPARES have an initial consultation with a trained counselor that includes information
about safe and unsafe methods of self-induction. Misoprostol is presented as a safer alternative
to other methods, and women are given information on appropriate dosing, side effects, and
effectiveness. The model encourages women to attend a follow-up visit, either for antenatal or
post-abortion care depending on their decision. In July-December 2011, INPPARES reported
that 30% of women seeking harm-reduction services returned for an in-person follow-up visit.
In November 2011, INPPARES started offering follow-up services by telephone in addition
to in-person visits to women who received harm-reduction counseling. The option of tele-
phone follow-up was added to make the process more user-friendly for women with the hope
that it would increase the proportion of women obtaining follow-up care. The objectives of
this study were to document women’s experiences with and acceptability of this harm-reduc-
tion model of care, to document the effectiveness and safety of the harm-reduction model, and
to compare outcomes between women who receive telephone vs. in-person follow-up. Results
from this study have the potential to provide evidence for scale-up of the harm-reduction
model and telephone follow-up services in Peru as well as other countries where abortion is
legally restricted.
Materials and methods
Between January 2012 and March 2013, women who were eligible for harm-reduction services
based on the clinic standard of practice at INPPARES clinic study sites in Lima (2 sites) or
Chimbote (1 site) were recruited for the study. Women who spoke Spanish and were at least
18 years old were eligible to participate in the study.
Women went through the standard harm-reduction consultation, which included confir-
mation of pregnancy, assessment of gestational age by ultrasound and counseling about preg-
nancy options, including the use of misoprostol for those opting to terminate, and any other
needed emotional support. At the end of the initial harm-reduction consultation, clinic coun-
selors described in-person and telephone follow-up options to all women. If a woman wanted
the counselor to call her, this call was scheduled in advance, although women were also en-
couraged to call the clinic at any point if they had questions. The counselor then introduced
the research study to potential participants, and if the woman was interested in participating
in the study, the counselor reviewed the informed consent form with her. When a woman

 agreed to participate in the study, she orally consented, and a copy of the form was given to
her. Women who gave informed consent were asked to provide a telephone number where
they could be contacted and a name or pseudonym they would like to be identified by when
the interviewer called. Alternatively, if a woman preferred to call, she was given a card with the
name and telephone number of the interviewer, the approximate date when she should call,
and her study ID number.
Women who chose telephone follow-up underwent an assessment that was based on a
study in the US [16]. Telephone assessment occurred approximately one week after counsel-
ing, and clinic staff asked whether women had taken misoprostol. Those indicating they had
taken misoprostol were asked a series of questions to confirm successful completion of the
abortion and to gather information about the woman’s experience. The questions used to eval-
uate abortion completion were:
1. Did you have pain and bleeding heavier than a normal period?
2. Did you expel blood clots and/or tissue?
3. Is your bleeding currently less than the heaviest day of your period?
4. Have the symptoms of pregnancy (nausea, swollen breasts) disappeared?
If the answer was “no” or “not sure” to any of these, counselors encouraged women to
come to the clinic. Women were given information about additional assessments that could be
done, such as ultrasound or urine pregnancy testing, to confirm completion of the abortion.
Counselors also provided emotional support and information about contraception at the time
of the follow-up call.
Data for this analysis came from two sources: 1) participants were called by study interview-
ers approximately one month after recruitment to complete a questionnaire via telephone
(which was separate from any telephone follow-up provided by clinic staff) and 2) we
abstracted demographic and clinical data from clinic records at the initial counseling visit.
Clinical data for enrolled participants were obtained from information normally documented
in patient records as a part of the clients’ regular care.
The telephone questionnaire aimed to examine women’s experiences with and acceptability
of the harm-reduction model of service provision. The questionnaire included closed- and
open-ended items asking women about their pregnancy decision and outcome, and for women
who chose to have an abortion, experiences obtaining and using misoprostol, the amount and
timing of medication taken, and experiences with side effects and complications. Women were
asked about their experience and satisfaction with the initial and follow-up sessions and reasons
for not returning for follow-up. If women scheduled three calls with the interviewer without
successfully completing the interview or were unreachable three months after their initial con-
sult, they were considered lost to follow-up. Participants were reimbursed approximately USD
$7 in cellular phone time or cash for completing the telephone questionnaire.
Clinical data were extracted from patient charts by Investigacio
´n en Salud y Demografı
´a
(INSAD), a non-profit health and demography research group in Mexico. Clinical data were
collected on paper forms for all women who obtained harm-reduction services and these
forms were sent to INSAD for data entry. INSAD extracted the clinical data of study partici-
pants based on their patient IDs.
Data from telephone questionnaires were captured in the encrypted online survey program,
SurveyMonkey (SurveyMonkey Inc.,Palo Alto, CA), either while the interview was conducted
or afterward if internet was unavailable. Questionnaire data, as well as demographic and clini-
cal information, were entered into a database with no personal identifiers and analyzed in

 StataIC 12 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). The study was approved by the Allendale
Investigational Review Board which is the IRB usually used by Ibis Reproductive Health
(where the principal investigator was based at the time of data collection). INPPARES leader-
ship reviewed the protocol internally and relied on the Allendale IRB approval.
In order to compare women across type of follow-up and evaluate telephone follow-up
specifically, we categorized participants into three groups based on the type of follow-up
they received: telephone only, in-person (including in-person only, or both in-person and
telephone follow-up), and no follow-up. Some women with telephone-only or no follow-up
did report having an ultrasound performed at a facility other than INPPARES to confirm
the abortion was complete; however, if the woman did not self-report this clinical encoun-
ter as in-person follow-up, it was not categorized as such during analysis. Commonly
women did not tell the provider who performed the ultrasound that they had had an
abortion.
In order to assess whether women took the misoprostol regimen recommended by
INPPARES, we asked women about how many pills they took at each dosing and the amount
of time that passed between doses. Women were considered to be within the medically-recom-
mended range if they took two or three doses of 800 mcg of misoprostol per dose and outside
the medically-recommended range if they 1) took less than a total dose of 1600 mcg, 2) took a
total dose of 1600–2400 mcg but in a number of doses that did not align with recommenda-
tions, 3) took more than 2400 mcg regardless of number of doses.
The sample size for this study was based on feasibility and determined by the number of
participants that could be recruited and followed up during the 15-month data collection
period. We used descriptive statistics to describe the study sample and identify the clinical tra-
jectories of patients, including the proportion that chose to have an abortion, misoprostol use,
the regimen they used, and clinical outcomes. Satisfaction with initial and follow-up visits and
selected clinical outcomes were compared across follow-up categories using Fisher’s exact tests
and t-tests.
Results
There were 1,574 women who received harm-reduction counseling at INPPARES study sites
during the study period. Clinic counselors invited 955 (61%) of these women to participate in
the evaluation, and a total of 500 women (52% of women recruited) agreed to participate and
were enrolled in the study. Among those that enrolled, 48% were lost to follow-up. Nine
women that completed the survey (3%) were excluded from analysis: five did not meet inclusion
criteria (they attended counseling for contraception options, they did not have an unwanted
pregnancy, or they were younger than 18 years of age), and four answered fewer than 30% of
the questions. Therefore, 253 women were included in analysis (Fig 1).
Demographic information from abstracted clinic forms was available for 229 participants
completing the interview and is summarized in Table 1. The women in the sample had a mean
age of 26 (range: 18–47 years). The majority had completed secondary education (69%) and
were single (71%). Almost half of the women (46%) did not report any paid work, while 31%
had formal paid work and 23% had informal paid work. The majority of participants had
never given birth (62%) and reported no prior abortions (73%). The mean gestational age at
ultrasound was 6 weeks (range: 4–10 weeks). Demographic data were also available for 230
women who consented for the study but were unable to be contacted for the follow-up inter-
view. Those lost to follow-up were similar to those who completed the interview, except more
married women and more women in Chimbote were lost to follow-up; there was also a trend
toward more women without paid work being lost to follow-up (Table 1).

 Harm-reduction initial counseling and follow-up
The vast majority of participants (85%) reported being very satisfied with their initial harm-
reduction consultation visit. Most women reported that the information was very easy (57%)
or somewhat easy (29%) to understand, and the vast majority said they felt comfortable asking
questions (97%), although a significantly lower proportion of those with no follow-up (88%)
reported feeling comfortable asking questions (Table 2). Most women reported they decided
to have an abortion (88%), and of those, all took misoprostol except three women who ob-
tained a surgical termination. A small proportion of women (3%) reported they had a miscar-
riage, and 9% decided to continue the pregnancy (Fig 2). Among the 220 women who took
misoprostol, 46% reported receiving in-person follow-up (12% received in-person only and
34% received both telephone and in-person), 34% received telephone only, and 20% did not
receive any form of follow-up. Of the participants reporting no follow-up (n = 43), the most
common reason was that they did not have time or had other personal commitments (n = 30).
Of note, women recruited in Chimbote, the smaller, more rural recruitment site, were more

 recommend the service to a friend compared to those with any type of follow-up (91% vs.
100% for telephone only follow-up and 99% for any in-person follow-up, p = 0.02). Similarly, a
lower proportion of women who had no follow-up said they would use the service again if they
were in a similar situation (88% vs. 100% for telephone only follow-up and 95% for any in-per-
son follow-up, p = 0.03) (Table 2).
As an alternative to both telephone and in-person follow-up, we asked women if they
would be interested in a program that provided text message follow-up. Approximately three-
quarters (77%) of participants were very or somewhat interested in the text message option,
with a trend toward higher interest among women who did not have follow-up as compared to
those with telephone only or in-person (Table 2).
Misoprostol use and clinical outcomes
All study participants who reported obtaining misoprostol also reported taking the medication
to self-induce an abortion (n = 220). In addition to the information received from the coun-
selor, women reported getting information from other sources, including family and friends
and the internet (Table 3). Women reported traveling a median of 30 minutes from their
Fig 2. Women’s clinical trajectories. The number and proportion of study participants who had an abortion or miscarriage or continued the pregnancy are
shown. For those who had an abortion, the number and proportion who reported taking misoprostol, obtaining a uterine aspiration and having a complete
abortion by the time of the study interview are shown.

 home to obtain the medication at pharmacies (80%), from family or friends (11%) or from the
internet (4%). Forty-six percent found it somewhat or very easy to get misoprostol, 37% found
it somewhat hard, and 14% found it very hard. The most common challenge was that the phar-
macy refused to sell the medication or required a doctor’s prescription. The average cost of a
single misoprostol tablet was approximately $3, and all but 10 women were able to obtain the
amount recommended during their harm-reduction consultation visit (data not shown).

 At the time of taking misoprostol, 37% of women reported being very sure and 32%
reported being somewhat sure that they knew how to take the correct regimen. Almost three-
quarters of women took misoprostol according to the recommended regimen, while 27% of
women followed a regimen outside the recommendations. Among those that did not follow
the recommended regimen, the majority took less than 1600 mcg of misoprostol (Table 3).
Among women who took misoprostol, 8% (n = 17) reported adverse events including hem-
orrhage (without transfusion), infection, or severe pain. Treatments included antibiotics (2%;
n = 5), intravenous fluids (1%; n = 1) and/or surgical abortion (4%; n = 8). Six women (3%)
reported no treatment for their symptoms. Only two of the women (1%) spent one or more
nights in a hospital, both of whom reported receiving treatment for infection. Rates of adverse
events were similar across women with in-person and telephone follow-up, and importantly,
no adverse events were reported among women with no follow-up (Table 4).
Eighty-nine percent of women who took misoprostol reported having a complete abortion
and when asked how they knew it was complete, the majority said they had an ultrasound
(67%) (Table 4). The proportion reporting ultrasound was highest among those with in-person
follow-up (80%), but it was also commonly reported among those with telephone-only (57%)
or no follow-up (44%). Twenty-two percent reported having a surgical procedure such as uter-
ine curettage or vacuum aspiration by the time of the follow-up interview, and all of these
reported that the abortion was now complete. There were 24 women (11%) who took miso-
prostol and reported their abortion was incomplete or they did not know it if was complete at
the time of the telephone interview. Women who reported being unsure if the abortion was
complete said they planned to get medical attention either at INPPARES (n = 4, 16%) or
another facility (n = 6, 25%), while one said she planned to take another dose of misoprostol.
Those who had any in-person follow-up were most likely to report the abortion was complete
(97%), followed by telephone-only (88%) and no-follow-up (70%) (Table 4).
At the time of the telephone questionnaire, 55% of women who took misoprostol were
using a contraceptive method, and women with follow-up of any kind (in-person, telephone
or both) were more likely to use post-abortion contraception than those without follow-up
(58% vs 40%; p = 0.04). Most women using contraception reported using more effective meth-
ods, including IUD, implants, and hormonal methods such as the pill or injectable (Table 4).
Discussion
This study is one of the few to document outcomes with a harm-reduction model of care
aimed at reducing the risks associated with unsafe abortion. We found that the vast majority of
women receiving the initial harm-reduction counseling—including those who did not return
for follow-up—went on to take misoprostol appropriately and terminated their pregnancies in
this context. Although satisfaction with the model was high, women also report challenges
obtaining the drug, and some said they were unsure about how to take it. These findings sug-
gest that other models of care that include medication provision, including expanding the pro-
vision of care within the legal guidelines or through telemedicine, could further improve
access to safe abortion in settings with restrictive legislation [17] [18] [19]. In 2014, Peru
launched a national protocol for legal abortion, which will help physicians to better provide
services within the legal framework [20]. Ultimately, legal reform is also needed to ensure
women’s health and reproductive rights are fully respected.
The clinical outcomes we observed with this model of care are similar to published data on
the use of misoprostol alone for early medication abortion. Among women taking misoprostol,
22% reported having a surgical procedure to complete the abortion, which is similar to the effi-
cacy of the misoprostol alone regimen (approximately 85%) reported in large clinical trials

 [21], although some women in our study (14%) were still unsure if the abortion was complete
at the time of the interview. The proportion receiving a surgical procedure may be somewhat
higher in this legally restricted setting given that women may seek follow-up care without giv-
ing complete information about their medical history. For example, they may seek care saying
they had a spontaneous miscarriage, and physicians may be more likely to intervene with a
surgical evacuation. Higher rates of curettage have been reported among women living in
Table 4. Clinical outcomes and contraceptive use by follow-up type among women who used misoprostol.

 Latin America who access a telemedicine site providing medical abortion with mifepristone
and misoprostol compared to those living in Western Europe [19].
Few women reported serious adverse events after taking misoprostol on their own. Only
two of 220 women (1%) reported a major complication, defined as transfusion, abdominal sur-
gery or overnight hospitalization [22]; both of these women reported being hospitalized for
treatment of an infection. The low prevalence of major complications is similar to reported
findings from the Uruguay harm-reduction model [23]. These studies corroborate data from
Brazil, where serious complications were much less common with use of misoprostol com-
pared to other methods of clandestine abortion [5]. Other reports from Peru suggest that
maternal mortality related to abortion has declined with more widespread access to misopros-
tol [12].
We found that adding the option of telephone follow-up was associated with more women
who underwent harm-reduction counseling obtaining some type of follow-up (77%) com-
pared to historical data (30% obtained in-person follow-up in July-December 2011). At the
same time, satisfaction with telephone follow-up was high and similar to that reported with in-
person follow-up. Women who had telephone follow-up were somewhat less certain the abor-
tion was complete compared to those that had in-person follow-up, but they were more certain
than those who had no follow-up. Most women who had telephone follow-up and were not
sure the abortion was complete reported they were planning to go back to the clinic or take
another dose of misoprostol, suggesting that accurate information had been transmitted to
these women. It is notable that three-quarters of the participants reported being interested in a
text-message option for follow-up, and more research should be done to explore this model in
Peru.
Since this research was performed, studies have documented the accuracy of a multi-level
pregnancy test to identify women with ongoing pregnancy after medication abortion [24, 25].
These tests have multiple strips to detect different concentration ranges of hCG in urine, and
the hCG concentration usually falls after a successful medication abortion. An increase in hCG
concentration or a stable reading 5–15 days after using the drugs has a very high sensitivity
for detecting ongoing pregnancy after medication abortion used up to 63 days. Most of the
research on multi-level pregnancy tests after medication abortion has focused on the mifepris-
tone regimen; more research is needed on using the test with misoprostol alone, especially in
legally restricted settings.
Providing women comprehensive post-abortion contraceptive services, including counsel-
ing about and provision of the full range of contraceptive methods, is an important component
of abortion care, including harm-reduction services. It is interesting that contraceptive uptake
was similar in the telephone and in-person follow-up groups, suggesting that the addition of
telephone follow-up improves contraceptive use post-abortion compared to no follow-up. All
contraceptive methods other than the IUD can be offered on the first day of medication abor-
tion, even with the mifepristone regimen [26] [27]. Provision of depoprovera and implants on
the day of harm-reduction counseling may not be feasible because women may not have
decided on the plans for the pregnancy and due to legal constraints.
This study has several limitations. Only about half of women invited to participate in the
study agreed to participate, and we were able to contact only about half of those women for the
follow-up interview. However, we observed few demographic differences between those lost to
follow-up and those interviewed. Unfortunately this high loss-to-follow-up is a reality of abor-
tion-related research in settings where the procedure is legally restricted and highly stigma-
tized. In addition, the findings here are specific to the model implemented in this context and
may differ from other settings. For example, in other countries, such as in Central America,

 misoprostol is very difficult to obtain in the community, so the outcomes of the model may be
different.
Worldwide, unsafe abortion is estimated to account for 8–18% of maternal deaths [2] [28]
as well as a large number of medical complications [29]. Evidence from several countries indi-
cates that liberalization of restrictive abortion laws results in improvements in health outcomes
[30] [31], but the process of legal reform is often lengthy. In the interim, giving women infor-
mation about evidence-based regimens of misoprostol that can be used to safely terminate an
early pregnancy, as well as offering a range of follow-up options to ensure high quality post-
abortion care, may reduce the harms associated with unsafe abortion. Rather than waiting for
laws to change in settings where unsafe abortion is prevalent, medical professionals should
explore introducing a harm-reduction model to improve women’s health in their countries.
