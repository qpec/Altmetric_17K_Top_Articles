Abstract
Background: Testicular cancer survivors (TCS) are at significantly increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), with metabolic syndrome 
(MetS) an established risk factor. No study has addressed clinical and genetic MetS risk factors in North American TCS. Patients and Methods: 
TCS were aged <55 years at diagnosis and received first-line chemotherapy. Patients underwent physical examination, and had lipid pan-
els, testosterone, and soluble cell adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) evaluated. A single nucleotide polymorphism in rs523349 (5-α-reductase 
gene, SRD5A2), recently implicated in MetS risk, was genotyped. Using standard criteria, MetS was defined as ≥3 of the following: hyper-
tension, abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, and diabetes. Matched con-
trols were derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Results: We evaluated 486 TCS (median age, 38.1 years). TCS 
had a higher prevalence of hypertension versus controls (43.2% vs 30.7%; P<.001) but were less likely to have decreased HDL levels (23.7% 
vs 34.8%; P<.001) or abdominal obesity (28.2% vs 40.1%; P<.001). Overall MetS frequency was similar in TCS and controls (21.0% vs 22.4%; 
P=.59), did not differ by treatment (P=.20), and was not related to rs523349 (P=.61). For other CVD risk factors, TCS were significantly more 
likely to have elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (17.7% vs 9.3%; P<.001), total cholesterol levels (26.3% vs 11.1%; 
P<.001), and body mass index ≥25 kg/m2 (75.1% vs 69.1%; P=.04). On multivariate analysis, age at evaluation (P<.001), testosterone level 
≤3.0 ng/mL (odds ratio [OR], 2.06; P=.005), and elevated sICAM-1 level (ORhighest vs lowest quartile, 3.58; P=.001) were significantly associated with 
MetS. Conclusions and Recommendations: Metabolic abnormalities in TCS are characterized by hypertension and increased LDL and total 
cholesterol levels but lower rates of decreased HDL levels and abdominal obesity, signifying possible shifts in fat distribution and fat me-
tabolism. These changes are accompanied by hypogonadism and inflammation. TCS have a high prevalence of CVD risk factors that may 
not be entirely captured by standard MetS criteria. Cancer treatment–associated MetS requires further characterization.

Testicular cancer (TC) is the most common cancer 
among men aged 18 to 39 years, with increasing inci-
dence over the past 20 years.1 Cisplatin-based chemo-
therapy has resulted in unprecedented survival rates 
among patients with metastatic disease,2 with cure ex-
pected in 80%.3 Overall, the 5-year relative survival 
rate for all patients with TC is 95%.4 As a result, 1 in 
600 men in the United States is now a TC survivor 
(TCS),5 with a gain of upwards of 40 years of life.6 
Thus, TCS comprise a unique population in which 
to study the long-term adverse effects of cancer treat-
ment in survivors of adult-onset cancer.7 In particular, 
TCS treated with chemotherapy experience up to a 
7-fold increased long-term risk for cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD) compared with controls.8–13 
In the general population, metabolic syndrome 
(MetS) is a major risk factor for CVD.14 MetS is a 
constellation of interrelated CVD risk factors, in-
cluding insulin resistance, hypertension, elevated 
triglyceride levels, decreased high-density lipopro-
tein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and obesity.14 Using 
various definitions, European studies of TCS have 
reported a wide variation in the prevalence of MetS, 
ranging from 13% to 39%.15–19 Some investigations 
have demonstrated MetS risk to be higher among 
TCS compared with controls,15–18 but others have 
not.19 Boer et al20 reported MetS to be more prev-
alent in TCS carrying the minor allele of a single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs523349 (V89L), 
compared with wild-type (33% vs 19%; P=.032). 
This SNP is a nonsynonymous coding variant in the 
SRD5A2 gene, encoding steroid 5-α-reductase type 
II. The prevalence of MetS was particularly high 
(66.7%) in TCS who had low testosterone levels 
(<4.3 ng/mL) and carried a minor allele (homozy-
gous or heterozygous) genotype.
Given the conflicting data on MetS prevalence 
in European studies of TCS and the lack of informa-
tion in North American patients, we evaluated for 
the first time MetS and associated risk factors among 
a large cohort of North American TCS.21 We also 
examined the reported association of the rs523349 
SNP with MetS in our patients.
Patients and Methods
Participants
The ongoing Platinum Study is evaluating the late 
consequences of platinum-based chemotherapy and 
has been approved by Institutional Review Boards 
at all participating institutions.21,22 Each participant 
provided written informed consent allowing access 
to medical records since cancer diagnosis. Eligibil-
ity criteria included a diagnosis of germ cell tumor 
(GCT) at age <55 years, treatment with first-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy, no salvage chemo-
therapy, no radiotherapy, and no antecedent chemo-
therapy for another primary cancer. All participants 
were disease-free at the time of clinical evaluation. 
We included in this analysis all TCS for whom blood 
samples had been analyzed and who had complete 
data on all MetS components.
Assessments
Sociodemographic, Lifestyle, and Behavioral Fac-
tors: TCS completed a questionnaire regarding 
health outcomes, lifestyle behaviors, and current 
prescription medications (including antihyperten-
sive, diabetic, and lipid-lowering medications). 
Demographic information included age at cancer 
diagnosis and clinical evaluation, race, education, 
employment, and marital status. Smoking status 
was categorized as current, former, or never-smoker. 
Physical activity was reported as the average time per 
week engaged in various forms of exercise.23 Mod-
erate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity were 
defined as participating in at least one activity per 
week with a metabolic equivalent of 3 to <6, or ≥6 
metabolic equivalents, respectively.24,25 
Data Collection From Medical Records: Study staff 
abstracted data according to a uniform protocol, us-
ing forms adapted from a prior study.22 Data included 
date of GCT diagnosis, histology and site of GCT, 
and, for each cytotoxic drug, name, dose, dates of 
administration, number of cycles, and cumulative 
dose. All data were entered into the eClinicalWorks 
system (Westborough, MA), supported by the study 
coordinating center.
Clinical Evaluation: TCS underwent a physical 
examination measuring height, weight, and waist 
circumference. Body mass index (BMI) was calcu-
lated as kg/m2. Blood pressure was measured twice 
after resting for 5 minutes and then averaged. Blood 
samples were drawn, time of last meal was recorded, 
and the samples were frozen and shipped to the cen-
tral laboratory. Serum levels of testosterone, lutein-
izing hormone, lipids, creatinine, and soluble cell

adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), a known CVD 
biomarker,26–28 were measured using commercial as-
says. Hypogonadism was defined using the FDA 
definition (total serum testosterone ≤3.0 ng/mL),29 
which is commonly used in clinical practice. 
DNA Genotyping and Imputation: DNA was ex-
tracted from blood samples collected at clinical eval-
uation. SNPs were genotyped on the HumanOm-
niExpressExome-8 BeadChip (Illumina, Inc., San 
Diego, CA) at the RIKEN Center for Integrative 
Medical Sciences. Because the SNP of interest is not 
called on this chip, we performed genotype imputa-
tion following standard quality control measures as 
previously described.30 Imputation was performed on 
the University of Michigan Imputation Server31 with 
the following parameters: 1000 Genomes Phase 1 
(version 3) Shapeit2 (no singletons) reference panel, 
SHAPEIT phasing, and the EUR (European) popula-
tion. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) structures around 
the variant of interest were determined using NIH’s 
LDlink32 using the CEU (European) population.
Definition of MetS
MetS was defined using a modification of the Na-
tional Cholesterol Education Program’s Adult Treat-
ment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) Guidelines14 as the 
presence of ≥3 of the following (Table 1): (1) systolic 
blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood 
pressure ≥85 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive medi-
cation; (2) abdominal obesity (waist circumference 
≥102 cm); (3) self-reported diabetes and medication 
use; (4) HDL cholesterol level <40 mg/dL or lipid-
lowering medication; and/or (5) serum triglyceride 
level ≥150 mg/dL (fasting) or ≥175 mg/dL (nonfast-
ing). These MetS criteria were developed by several 
major organizations to represent one harmonized 
definition.14 Criteria for HDL and triglyceride cut 
points were adapted from recent guidelines.33
Control Group
Matched controls for selected comparisons were 
chosen from the National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES) using 2 consecutive 
data sets (2011–2012 and 2013–2014), following 
methods applied by the St. Jude’s Lifetime Cohort 
study.34 Controls (restricted to men without cancer) 
were matched 1:1 on race, age (within 5 years), and 
educational level.
Statistical Analyses
Data were summarized, with medians (ranges) for 
continuous variables and proportions for categorical 
variables in 2 TCS subgroups defined by the presence 
or absence of MetS. The 2 groups were compared us-
ing the Pearson chi-square and 2-sided Wilcoxon 
rank sum tests on categorical and continuous vari-
ables, respectively. TCS were compared with con-
trols using the Pearson chi-square test with regard 
to the prevalence of various MetS components, as 
well as other CVD risk factors not included in the 
NCEP ATP III criteria. A composite score was calcu-
lated based on the cut points for the individual MetS 
components, with a range of 0 to 5 (0 indicated no 
abnormal components). Based on MetS diagnostic 
criteria,14 participants with a composite score of 3 to 
5 were classified with MetS.

To determine factors associated with MetS in 
TCS, a 2-step approach was used. First, logistic re-
gression models were used to estimate the odds ratios 
(ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and P values 
for all clinical, demographic, behavioral, and labora-
tory measures. Second, factors that were significant-
ly associated with MetS in univariate analyses were 
included in the multivariable model. All statistical 
analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Insti-
tute, Cary, NC). All tests were 2-sided, with P values 
<.05 considered statistically significant.
Results
TCS Characteristics
Median time from chemotherapy completion to 
study enrollment was 4.7 years (range, 0.4–23.9). 
TCS with MetS (n=102) were significantly older 
at clinical evaluation compared with those without 
MetS (n=384; median, 44.4 vs 36.6 years; P<.001) 
(supplemental eTable 1, available with this article at 
JNCCN.org). TCS received either bleomycin/eto-
poside/cisplatin (BEP; 54.7%) or etoposide/cisplatin 
(EP; 33.1%), but MetS prevalence did not differ by 
treatment regimen nor by cumulative dose of cispla-
tin or bleomycin. TCS with MetS had a significant-
ly higher prevalence of obesity (60.8% vs 22.7%; 
P<.001), hypogonadism (46.1% vs 26.8%; P<.001), 
and elevated sICAM levels compared with those 
without MetS (supplemental eTable 2). 
Comparison With Matched Controls
TCS were more likely to have hypertension (43.2% 
vs 30.7%; P<.001) but less likely to have low HDL 
levels (23.7% vs 34.8%; P<.001) and abdominal 
obesity (28.2% vs 40.1%; P<.001) compared with 
controls (Table 2). Although overall MetS preva-
lence in TCS and controls was comparable (21.0% 
vs 22.4%; P=.59), there were significant differences 
in other CVD risk factors not included in the NCEP 
ATP III definition. TCS were more likely to have 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels 
≥160 mg/dL (17.7% vs 9.3%; P<.001), total choles-
terol levels ≥240 mg/dL (26.3% vs 11.1%; P<.001), 
and BMI ≥25 kg/m2 (75.1% vs 69.1%; P=.04). Ad-
ditionally, a larger proportion of TCS compared with 
controls reported participating in moderate- (93.8% 
vs 42.4%; P<.001) or vigorous-intensity (66.7% vs

Factors Associated With MetS in TCS 
Results of a univariate analysis of factors potentially 
associated with MetS are shown in Table 3. Factors 
statistically significant on univariate analysis were 
incorporated into a multivariate model, in which 
age, low serum testosterone level, and sICAM level 
remained significantly associated with MetS (Ta-
ble 4). For every 10-year increase in age at clinical 
evaluation, MetS risk increased by 1.7-fold (95% 
CI, 1.33–2.30; P<.001). Testosterone level ≤3.0 ng/
mL was associated with a significant 2-fold increased 
risk of MetS compared with higher levels (P=.005). 
MetS risk increased monotonically with increasing 
sICAM level (OR, 3.58 comparing highest vs low-
est quartile; P=.001). Educational level, marital sta-
tus, alcohol intake, and vigorous-intensity physical 
activity were not associated with MetS risk in the 
multivariate model.
Genetic Association of MetS With SRD5A2 
The SNP rs523349 showed high imputation qual-
ity (R2=1), call rate (>0.99), and perfect Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium (P=1.0). This imputed SNP 
was in perfect LD with a nearby genotyped SNP, 
rs12467911. LDlink revealed that the expected LD 
R2 in a European population is 0.975. Genotype fre-
quencies by MetS status are presented in Table 5. 
The variant genotype did not correlate with MetS 
(P=.61).
Discussion
Our investigation represents the largest to date to 
address the prevalence of metabolic abnormalities 
in TCS treated with contemporary platinum-based 
regimens and is the only investigation of North 
American patients. At a median age of only 38 years, 
3 in 4 TCS were overweight or obese, 43% had hy-
pertension, and a significantly higher proportion had 
elevated LDL or total cholesterol levels compared 
with matched controls. Overall, 1 in 5 TCS had 
MetS according to the NCEP ATP III definition.14 
No difference was seen in the prevalence of MetS 
by treatment regimen (BEP vs EP) nor by cumula-
tive dose of cisplatin or bleomycin. Significant risk 
factors for MetS included hypogonadism, increasing

age, and increasing sICAM level. No association 
with MetS was observed with the variant genotype 
for rs523349.
Westerink et al35 recently pointed out that the 
etiology of cancer treatment-induced MetS (CTI-
MetS) differs from MetS in the general population, 
where sedentary lifestyle, along with excess caloric 
intake, are the primary causes.14 In contrast, CTI-
MetS is multifactorial and differs by cancer diagnosis, 
treatment, and patient characteristics. Surgery,36,37 
radiotherapy,38 chemotherapy,18,19,39 and hormonal 
therapy40–44 have each been shown to induce CTI-
MetS. In TCS, hypogonadism and chemotherapy, 
rather than sedentary behavior, are likely the main 
causes for metabolic abnormalities. The TCS in our 
study were at least twice more likely than controls to 
engage in moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical 
activity. Despite this, we did not find a significant 
difference in the prevalence of MetS between TCS 
and NHANES controls, likely because MetS crite-
ria originally developed for the general population14 
does not reflect the full spectrum of metabolic abnor-
malities seen in TCS.
The relationships between hypogonadism with 
MetS and CVD in the general population45–50 and 
TCS13,16–19 are well-established. In our study, approx-
imately one-third of survivors were hypogonadal, 
which is higher than reported in the general popula-
tion51 but not unexpected because our participants 
had undergone orchiectomy. In our cohort, TCS with 
hypogonadism were twice as likely to have MetS in 
multivariate analysis. Hypogonadism also correlated 
with obesity, hypertension, and high LDL and total 
cholesterol levels in univariate analysis (data not 
shown). Hypogonadism may also explain the lower 
prevalence of low HDL in TCS compared with con-
trols because androgens can have a suppressive effect 
on HDL.52 In addition, the smaller waist circumfer-
ence in TCS compared with controls, while having 
a higher BMI, may be explained by increased femoral 
adipose tissue deposition observed in hypogonadal 
compared with eugonadal patients.53

Metabolic Outcomes After Testis Cancer
263
Studies of the effect of testosterone replace-
ment on MetS and CVD risk in TCS are sparse. 
Although such investigations in older men in the 
general population showed favorable effects on lip-
id metabolism, bone mineral density, muscle mass, 
and fat-free body mass,54,55 the effects of testosterone 
replacement on CVD risk have been conflicting.56 
One clinical trial showed an excess of CVD adverse 
events in older men treated with testosterone com-
pared with placebo,57 but another trial in a similar 
population did not.58 However, these findings may 
not apply to young and physically active TCS. For 
young TCS with symptomatic hypogonadism, testos-
terone replacement should be considered, and future 
research is needed to address both the benefits and 
risks of testosterone replacement therapy.
Inflammation is considered a critical pathogenic 
component of atherosclerosis.59 de Haas et al17 pro-
vided a comprehensive assessment of proinflamma-
tory markers in chemotherapy-treated TCS, finding 
significantly elevated levels of several markers in pa-
tients with MetS versus those without. Herein, we 
found that sICAM levels increased with increasing 
MetS risk even after adjustment for age and addi-
tional risk factors in multivariate analysis. sICAM is 
an adhesion molecule that serves a critical role in 
the adhesion and transmigration of leucocytes across 
the endothelial wall, an early step in the formation 
of the atherosclerotic plaque.60 Epidemiologic stud-
ies have shown strong, positive associations between 
sICAM levels and future CVD events in apparently 
healthy men and women.26–28 Vaughn et al61 report-
ed sICAM levels to be higher in TCS treated with 
chemotherapy than with surgery alone, suggesting a 
direct mechanism for CVD through chemotherapy-
induced endothelial dysfunction. In vitro studies fur-
ther support this hypothesis.62–64 
There has been increasing interest in personal-
izing care for cancer survivors. One approach is to 
identify genetic variants that can predispose survi-
vors to selected adverse health outcomes.7 In this 
study, we evaluated an SNP (rs523349) in the ste-
roid 5-α-reductase type II gene recently associated 
with MetS in TCS.20 This SNP decreases enzyme ac-
tivity and thus the conversion of testosterone to the 
more active metabolite dihydrotestosterone.65 The 
frequencies of the wild-type and variant rs523349 in 
our cohort were comparable to those in Boer et al20 
(Table 5); however, in our cohort, with more than 
twice the sample size, we found no association with 
MetS. An approach that accounts for multiple genes 
involved in relevant pathways may better identify 
clinically actionable results that could inform risk-
adapted management approaches.
The prevalence of MetS in our patients is within 
the range (17%–41%) reported in European stud-
ies of platinum-treated TCS (summarized in supple-
mental eTable 3).13,15–19 Although each European 
series used slightly different criteria for MetS than 
applied in this study, it is still possible to compare 
the prevalence of individual MetS components. 
The most pronounced component of MetS among 
our TCS was hypertension (43%). Haugnes et al19 
found significantly increased risks of hypertension in 
patients treated with cisplatin compared with those 
treated surgically (≥45% vs 34%, respectively), as 
did Willemse et al18 (31% vs 14%, respectively). The 
association between cisplatin-based chemotherapy, 
hypertension, and CVD in TCS is well-established, 
and is reviewed elsewhere.7,64 
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of our study include the large number of 
patients, detailed medical chart abstraction, and use 
of contemporary and homogeneous platinum-based 
chemotherapy regimens. We used a definition for 
hypogonadism that is clinically relevant and easily 
applicable to clinical practice.
However, any cross-sectional design has poten-
tial limitations and does not allow us to infer causa-
tion of evaluated risk factors to MetS, although pro-
spective data collection is planned for this cohort. 
Additionally, the SNP of interest was imputed and 
not genotyped, although it was in perfect LD with a 
nearby genotyped SNP. Our study participants also 
largely represent well-educated TCS followed at 
major academic institutions, and the prevalence of 
MetS may be higher in community-based settings. 
Moreover, participants in the population-based 
NHANES cohort may not be comparable to our 
TCS in terms of all relevant sociodemographic and 
lifestyle variables.
Conclusions and Recommendations
There is a high prevalence of metabolic abnormali-
ties in TCS treated with chemotherapy at a relative-
ly young age and shortly after completion of cancer

treatment. The etiology of MetS in cancer survivors 
likely differs from the general population,35 thus, ap-
plying criteria developed for the general population 
to cancer survivors may underestimate CVD risk. 
Importantly, longitudinal cohort studies of survivors 
are needed to develop more accurate risk prediction 
models for CVD. Meanwhile, it is reasonable to as-
sume that management strategies for components
