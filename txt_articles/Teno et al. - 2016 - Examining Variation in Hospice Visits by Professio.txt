Examining Variation in Hospice Visits by Professional Staff
in the Last 2 Days of Life
Joan M. Teno, MD, MS; Mike Plotzke, PhD; Thomas Christian, PhD; Pedro Gozalo, PhD
IMPORTANCE In the final days of life, symptoms are exacerbated and often families need both
education and emotional support from hospice professional staff. The Medicare Hospice
Benefit provides a per-diem payment with no requirements on the frequency of patient
visits.
OBJECTIVE To examine individual characteristics, hospice program, and geographic variation
in hospice visits by professional staff during the last 2 days of life.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study of 661 557 Medicare
hospice beneficiaries included all patients who died in federal fiscal year 2014 (October 1,
2013–September 30, 2014) in hospice services while receiving routine home care in the last 2
days of life. Data analysis was conducted from March 9 to August 25, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Medicare regulations require that hospice care centers
report daily the frequency and duration of patient visits by professional staff, as well as the
type of hospice staff who conduct these visits. We examined visit variation by hospice
professional staff (physician, nursing staff, and social worker) during the last 2 days of life
using a multivariable logistic model adjusting for decedent and hospice program
characteristics.
RESULTS Of the 661 557 patients in the study, 81 478 (12.3%) received no professional staff
visits in the last 2 days of life. State variation ranged from 590 of 15 399 patients (3.8%) in
Wisconsin to 97 of 492 patients (19.7%) in Alaska, and hospice program interquartile variation
ranged from 3.2% (25th percentile) to 19.5% (75th percentile). Black patients were less likely
to have any visits than were white patients (7352 of 48 221 [15.2%] vs 70 365 of 585 377
[12.0%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.24-1.37). Those dying in a nursing home were
1.74 times less likely to have any visits than those dying at home (30 880 of 186 649 [16.5%]
vs 40 973 of 386 654 [10.6%]; 95% CI, 1.62-1.88). Those dying on a Sunday were 3.35 times
less likely to have a visit compared with persons dying on a Tuesday (19 519 of 95 979
[20.3%] vs 6784 of 92 127 [7.4%]; 95% CI, 3.17-3.55).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Hospice visits in the last 2 days of life by professional staff
vary by race, hospice program, and geographic region of the country. Visits were less likely
when the Medicare beneficiary was black, dying on a Sunday, and receiving care in a nursing
home.

A
key component of the Medicare hospice benefit that is
intended to ensure patient quality of life and safety is
that hospice programs should provide visits from pro-
fessionalstafftomonitorandtreatthepatient’
ssymptoms,pro-
vide emotional support to the dying patient and family mem-
bers, and educate caregivers on what to monitor, as well as
which treatments to provide for worsening symptoms and
when to call the hospice program for additional support. These
in-person visits are particularly important in the days imme-
diately preceding death, when symptoms and needs for emo-
tional support are extremely high.1,2 Medicare-certified hos-
pice programs are paid a per-diem rate to administer services
that include staff visits, medications, and durable medical
equipment to care for a patient’
s terminal illness and related
conditions.Similartoamanagedcareprofessional,hospicepro-
grams do not have any mandated minimum number of re-
quired visits for the most common level of hospice care re-
ferredtoroutinehomecare(RHC).However,ahospiceprogram
must deliver the highest possible quality of care for the dying
person and support the family members in their role as care-
givers with the payments they receive from Medicare.
In the development of the Family Evaluation of Hospice
Care survey,3,4 which asks families about their perceptions of
the care the patient received from hospice, focus group par-
ticipants noted the importance of professional hospice staff
in providing education and training to family caregivers. This
finding is illustrated by the following quotation from a focus
group member who was family to a person dying at home:
“I’
m glad I (kept her at home) but I think towards the end-
…giving the medications and upping the medications
seemed so fast. All of the sudden [sic] now she is on all this
morphine and all this whatever it is. And that kind of both-
ered me too. It really did. Because it was like, my God, I’
m
giving her this stuff. Am I giving her too much? I’
m not a
trained medical person.5(p743)
Anotherfamilymemberclearlyexpressedherdistressinher
caregiving role, stating, “I, being the caregiver, I was scared to
death.ImeanI’
mnotanurse.Idon’
thavethatexperience.
”5(p743)
Visits by professional staff who can assess symptoms and
make changes to the plans of care as well as work with the pa-
tient and the primary caregiver to provide the appropriate pal-
liation and emotional support are important to the quality of
care hospices deliver, as noted by the National Quality Fo-
rum’
s preferred practices on the recognition and manage-
ment of the actively dying patient.6 Previous research has
shown that patients have worsening symptoms as death ap-
proaches and family caregivers need education about how to
identify the signs and symptoms of impending death.1,2 Since
2010, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has re-
quired hospices to report the frequency, duration, and type of
visits they provide to their patients. Given the previous find-
ings from the development of the Family Evaluation of Hos-
pice Care survey, in which families voiced the importance of
visits by professional staff in the last days of life, we exam-
inedMedicareadministrativeclaimsdatacorrespondingtofed-
eral fiscal year 2014 to examine patterns in visits by hospice
professional staff to the dying patient and family in the final
2 days of life.
Methods
We examined all Medicare beneficiaries who died while in hos-
pice during federal fiscal year 2014 (October 1, 2013–
September 30, 2014). In addition, the patient had to be receiv-
ing only RHC services (the most common level of care that is
provided) during their final 2 days of life (ie, the last 2 calen-
dar days, with a partial day counted as 1 day). Routine home
care services are paid using a per-diem payment rate for hos-
pice services, in contrast with care for the hospice patient
during a crisis, which is provided under the continuous home
care level of care or general inpatient level of care. Continu-
ous home care has a mandatory requirement for visits by
nursing staff. The general inpatient level of care requires
24-hour nursing services. Our focus was on whether the
patient received a visit from the hospice’
s nursing staff (RN
and LPN), social workers, nurse practitioners, or physicians
in the last 2 days of life.
The main focus of this analysis was to examine the varia-
tion in visits received by patients as well as characteristics of
the professional staff. The Medicare enrollment database and
Medicare claims data were used to determine a patient’
s age,
sex, race and ethnicity, primary diagnosis, residential setting
atdeath(home,nursinghome,assistedlivingfacility,orother),
the lifetime length of stay in hospice, and the day the patient
died. We operationalized length of stay into quartiles, result-
ing in ranges of 7 days or less, 8 to 23 days, 24 to 91 days, and
92 days or more. The Provider of Services file was used to char-
acterize the age of the hospice program (classified into 4 quar-
tiles: ≤3, 4-8, 9-19, and ≥20 years), whether the hospice pro-
gram was facility-based, the tax status of the hospice program
(for profit vs nonprofit), the state in which the hospice pro-
gram was located, and the size of the hospice program (clas-
sified into 4 quartiles based on the number of Medicare hos-
pice deaths in federal fiscal year 2014: <33, 34-90, 91-201, and
>201 deaths). This study was reviewed and approved by the
Brown University Institutional Review Board, who waived the
requirement for patient consent.
Simple descriptive statistics were used to show the varia-
tion in the proportion of hospices providing no visits by pro-
fessionalstaffduringthelast2daysoflifeforpatientswhodied
while receiving RHC services. For the purpose of describing
hospice variation, we used only Centers for Medicare & Med-
icaid Services certification numbers for hospice programs that
had at least 30 discharges during federal fiscal year 2014. For
beneficiary-level analyses, we examined all hospices. In ad-
dition, we used descriptive statistics to characterize the asso-
ciation of sociodemographic characteristics, hospice primary
diagnosis,andorganizationalcharacteristicsofthehospicepro-
gram with the lack of professional staff visits in the last 2 days
of life. We used a multivariable logistic model to examine pa-
tientandhospiceorganizationalcharacteristicsassociatedwith
the lack of visits by professional staff. All models used robust
SEsthatadjustedforclusteringofpatientswithinahospicepro-
gram. All analyses were performed using Stata, version 13.1
(StataCorp). Data analysis was conducted from March 9 to
August 25, 2015.

Results
In federal fiscal year 2014, a total of 661 557 Medicare benefi-
ciaries cared for by 3935 hospice programs died while receiv-
ingRHClevelofhospicecareduringthelast2daysoflife.Over-
all, 81 478 of these patients (12.3%) did not receive any visits
from professional staff during the last 2 days of life. For those
notreceivingvisitsduringtheirlast2daysoflife,32 743(40.2%)
received a visit 3 days before death, 17 257 (21.2%) received a
visit 4 days before death, 9185 (11.3%) received a visit 5 days
before death, and the remaining 15 867 (19.5%) received a visit
6 days or more before death.
Variation by state in visits by professional staff in the last
days of life is shown in Figure 1. The state with the highest pro-
portion of patients not receiving visits from professional staff
in the last 2 days of life was Alaska (97 of 492 patients [19.7%]),
followed by Washington (2825 of 14 394 [19.6%]), New Jersey
(3417of17 753[19.2%]),andRhodeIsland(486of2528[19.2%]).
Only590of15 399patients(3.8%)inWisconsinwhodiedwhile
receiving hospice care did not receive any visits from profes-
sional staff in the last 2 days of life. There were 3935 hospices
in our sample; but, to examine the variation among the hos-
pice programs, we restricted the analysis to only the 3448 hos-
piceprogramswithatleast30discharges.Variationamonghos-
pice programs ranged from 281 hospice programs (8.1%) that
provided no visits during the last 2 days of life to 21 hospice
programs (0.6%) that provided visits to 100% of their pa-
tients receiving RHC services during their last 2 days of life.

visits from professional staff during the last 2 days of life com-
pared with the 1 793 012 patients in the other 3167 hospice pro-
gramsthatdidprovidesuchvisitsdifferedinanumberofways.
Patients from the 281 hospice programs that provided no
visits from professional staff during the last 2 days of life were
more likely to be in a rural area (14 444 [34.3%] vs 307 217
[17.1%]; P < .001), more likely to be treated by a hospice in exis-
tence for 3 years or less (7960 [18.9%] vs 137 898 [7.7%];
P < .001), less likely to be treated by a freestanding hospice
(28 459[67.5%]vs1 390 669[77.6%];P < .001),andmorelikely
to be treated by a for-profit hospice (20 951 [49.7%] vs 755 221
[42.1%]; P < .001).
Variation by Patient Characteristics
Of the full sample of 661 557 decedents, the proportion of pa-
tients who received no visits from professional staff in the last
2 days of life varied by patient sociodemographic character-
istics (Table). Relative to white patients, black patients were
less likely to have any visits from professional staff in the last
2 days of life (70 365 of 585 377 white patients [12.0%] vs 7352

of 48 221 black patients [15.2%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.30; 95%
CI, 1.24-1.37). Persons with a primary hospice diagnosis of un-
specified debility, dementia, or failure to thrive were less likely
to have professional staff visits in the last 2 days of life. In ad-
dition, hospice patients residing in nursing homes had a higher
proportion of not having any visits from professional staff in
the last 2 days of life compared with patients not in a nursing
home (30 880 of 186 649 [16.5%] vs 40 973 of 386 654 [10.6%];
adjusted odds ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.62-1.88). Figure 2 pre-
sents the proportion of visits by professional hospice staff in
the last 2 days of life based on the day of death. More than 1 in
5 persons who died on a Sunday (19 519 of 95 979 [20.3%]) did
not have a visit from professional staff in the last 2 days of life.
The day of death was a strong predictor of whether a patient
received a visit in the last 2 days of life, with those dying on
Sunday being 3.35 times more likely to not receive a visit in
the last 2 days of life compared with those dying on a Tues-
day (95% CI, 3.17-3.55).
Variation by Hospice Program Characteristics
Several hospice program characteristics were associated with
a lower likelihood of not receiving skilled visits in the last 2
days of life (Table). Smaller hospice programs (defined as those
with <33 deaths and those with 34-90 deaths) were signifi-
cantly less likely to provide visits by professional staff in the
last 2 days of life compared with programs with more than 201
deaths. Hospice programs based in a nursing home were less
likely to provide these visits compared with freestanding hos-
piceprograms(677of2240[30.2%]vs61 243of499 017[12.3%;
adjusted odds ratio, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.04-7.45). Visits did not dif-
fer by whether the hospice program was for profit or non-
profit.
Discussion
Physical symptoms, such as pain, dyspnea, and excess respi-
ratorysecretions,worseninthelastdaysoflife,withupto80%
of decedents experiencing 1 or more symptoms.1,2 The Na-
tional Quality Forum’
s Framework and Preferred Practices for
Palliative and Hospice Care Quality emphasized the impor-
tance of educating the family on what to expect and on symp-
tom management during the last hours of life.6 Focus groups
of family members attest to the importance of the hospice
staff’
s support in providing ongoing assessment, treatment of
symptoms, monitoring the plan of care, and education about
caring for the imminently dying patient.5 Professional staff,
such as physicians, nurses, and social workers, may imple-
ment changes to the care plan that ensure expert symptom
management. For these reasons, we studied visits by profes-

sional staff in the last 2 days of life and found that 12.3% of hos-
pice decedents did not receive such visits when undergoing
the most commonly provided level of care, RHC.
TheMedicareHospiceBenefitdoesnotmandateasetnum-
ber of visits for RHC services and states only that hospices are
responsible for providing high-quality care to dying patients
and their families. Our findings that professional staff from 281
hospice programs, which had at least 30 discharges, did not
visit any of their patients who received RHC services during
their last 2 days of life raises concerns that deserve further re-
search to understand whether a lack of visits by professional
staff affects the quality of care for that dying patient and their
family. In addition, black patients and frail, older patients re-
siding in nursing homes often did not receive visits from
hospice staff in the last 2 days of life, providing evidence of
disparities of care found in other areas of health care.
Previous research reported concerns with black Medi-
carebeneficiaries’accesstohospiceservices,includingahigher
proportion of patients discharged alive, and significant differ-
ences in bereaved family members’reporting of unmet needs,
concernswithqualityofcare,andtheoverallratingofthequal-
ity of hospice care.7-9 Our finding that black patients are less
likely to have visits by professional staff in the last 2 days of
life is a potential explanation for observations that bereaved
black family members rate their quality of care lower than
do their white counterparts. In addition, bereaved black
family members are more likely to have an unmet need for
pain and symptom management in hospice and to want
more information regarding management of the dying
patient’
s symptoms.9
Larger hospice programs (ie, those with >201 hospice
deaths among patients receiving RHC services) are more likely
to provide visits in the last 2 days of life. Previous research
has found an association of the size of the hospice program
with reduced live discharges,8,10 implementation of National
Quality Forum preferred practices,11 and an increased like-
lihood of providing labor-intensive bereavement services.12
Potential explanations include that larger hospice programs
may have the financial resources to provide more staffing
on weekends and/or create dedicated teams for off-hours
care.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recently fi-
nalized initial hospice payment reform policies. The 2 differ-
ent rates for RHC services will provide increased payment for
the first 60 days of hospice care and a service intensity add-on
policy will pay up to 4 hours per day in the last week of life for
an in-person visit by a social worker and/or registered nurse.
The changes may encourage additional services to ensure that
the hospice patient and family receive needed services. Hos-
pice professional staff expressed concerns about reimburse-
ment regarding the need for providing essential care, but not
meeting the requirements to bill for the continuous home
care level of hospice services. Thus, the service intensity
add-on policy may alleviate some of these concerns ex-
pressed by hospices.
There are important limitations to our study. Aside from
the patient’
s diagnosis, age, and other sociodemographic in-
formation, we did not have knowledge of the severity of the
dyingpatient’
ssymptomsorthefamily’
spreferencesforavisit.
It is possible that professional staff from the 281 hospice pro-
grams that did not have visits on days the patient was receiv-
ing RHC services during the last 2 days of life provided care
that anticipated problems and concerns at an earlier date, such
that a visit immediately prior to death was not needed. How-
ever, we believe that our finding that death on a Sunday is as-
sociated with fewer visits compared with death on any other
day of the week suggests that this explanation is less plau-
sible. Persons who died on a Sunday were more than 3 times
less likely to receive a visit during the last 2 days of life. Bio-
logically, it is implausible that any particular day of the week
would be associated with different severity of symptoms or
other family needs for education and support in the dying pro-
cess. It is possible that some of these patients suddenly died,
so we would not expect the proportion of those receiving no
visits by professional staff to be zero. Finally, we have no in-
formation on visits by spiritual counselors, which Medicare
does not require hospices to report. We examined visits only
by professional staff who can directly assess the patient’
s con-
dition and implement changes in the plan of care. While hos-
pice aides, spiritual counselors, and volunteers play an impor-
tant role in the care of patients and family, state law does not
allow them to assess the patient’
s condition and implement
changes to the hospice plans of care. Therefore, we do not be-
lieve they can serve as an adequate substitute for profes-
sional staff in terms of their ability to assess the patient’
s con-
dition and make changes to the plan of care.
Conclusions
Hospice care began as a social movement led by persons with
a vision to improve inadequate treatment of pain and other
symptoms at the end of life and to provide emotional support

to the family. Medicare policy has focused on the provision of
hospice care at “home” whether it is the patient’
s home, an as-
sisted living facility, or a nursing home. Regardless of the site
of service, a key part of safely caring for patients is that the hos-
pice professional staff provides ongoing assessment, moni-
toring, and education about the medical management of the
imminently dying patient. Our findings raise concerns that
black patients and nursing home residents receive less sup-
port in the last 2 days of life from hospice professional staff.
In addition, persons dying on a Sunday were less likely to re-
ceive any visits in the last 2 days of life. However, recent
changes to the Medicare hospice payment system may ad-
dress these problems. Starting in 2016, Medicare will provide
a service intensity add-on payment to hospices that provide
visits during the last 7 days of life (on days the patient is re-
ceiving RHC services). The intent of the payment is to pro-
mote visits by professional staff at the end of life and to bet-
ter align the payments hospices receive with the increased care
and service requirements at the end of life for all dying pa-
tients and those who care for them.

Invited Commentary
Variability in Hospice Care at the Very End of Life
Eric Widera, MD; Shaida Talebreza, MD
More than 1.6 million individuals in the United States receive
hospice care every year,1 which is provided by an increasing
numberofhospiceagencies.Whatstartedwithafewsmallnon-
profit hospice agencies in the
1970s is now a multibillion-
dollar industry comprising
nonprofit and for-profit com-
panies that have doubled in number in the last 10 years. With
this growth comes concern about variability in services and
the quality of care delivered by hospice agencies.
In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, Teno and
colleagues2 present more evidence that hospice agencies
differ in how they support patients at the very end of
life. While the vast majority of hospice patients receive
skilled visits from nurses, physicians, or social workers in
the last 2 days of life, 12.3% of hospice patients received no
skilled visits in the last 2 days of life. What raises the most
concern is the significant variation across hospice agencies
in skilled visits at the end of life. Most notably, 8.1% of hos-
pice agencies made no skilled visits in the last 2 days of life
