have
determined
whole body protein kinetics, i.e., protein synthesis (PS), break-
down (PB), and net balance (NB) in human subjects in the fasted
state and following ingestion of �40 g [moderate protein (MP)],
which has been reported to maximize the protein synthetic re-
sponse or �70 g [higher protein (HP)] protein, more representative
of the amount of protein in the dinner of an average American diet.
Twenty-three healthy young adults who had performed prior re-
sistance exercise (X-MP or X-HP) or time-matched resting (R-MP
or R-HP) were studied during a primed continuous infusion of
L-[2H5]phenylalanine and L-[2H2]tyrosine. Subjects were randomly
assigned into an exercise (X, n � 12) or resting (R, n � 11) group, and
each group was studied at the two levels of dietary protein intake in
random order. PS, PB, and NB were expressed as increases above the
basal, fasting values (mg·kg lean body mass�1·min�1). Exercise did
not significantly affect protein kinetics and blood chemistry. Feeding
resulted in positive NB at both levels of protein intake: NB was
greater in response to the meal containing HP vs. MP (P � 0.00001).
The greater NB with HP was achieved primarily through a greater
reduction in PB and to a lesser extent stimulation of protein synthesis
(for all, P � 0.0001). HP resulted in greater plasma essential amino
acid responses (P � 0.01) vs. MP, with no differences in insulin and
glucose responses. In conclusion, whole body net protein balance
improves with greater protein intake above that previously suggested
to maximally stimulating muscle protein synthesis because of a
simultaneous reduction in protein breakdown.
essential amino acids; optimal protein intake; protein turnover; stable
isotope tracers.
THE PRINCIPAL NUTRITIONAL goal of a protein-rich meal is to
induce an anabolic state in which protein synthesis exceeds
breakdown. Several recent studies, including our own (25),
indicate that the maximum acute stimulation of muscle protein
synthesis (MPS) occurs with ingestion of � 20–35 g of
high-quality protein (20, 25, 31) or more specifically 0.24 g·kg
body wt�1·meal�1 in healthy young adults (19). The maximal
dose in terms of stimulation of MPS is less than that typically
consumed with the dinner meal in the average American diet,
which generates a hypothesis that distributing the amount of
protein intake throughout the day can more effectively stimu-
late anabolic response. However, the assertion that there is
limited effectiveness of the conventional protein intake with
dinner is based on incomplete assessment of the metabolic
response of muscle protein. Importantly, the extent of mus-
cle protein anabolism (the anabolic response) is not simply
the response of MPS but rather the net balance between the
response of protein synthesis and protein breakdown. We
recently demonstrated the potential importance of suppres-
sion of protein breakdown in response to dietary intake of
meals containing two levels of protein totaling either 0.8 or 1.5
g protein·kg�1·day�1. We found that at both levels of dietary
protein whole body net protein balance became positive in the
fed state compared with the fasted state, mainly due to reduc-
tions in protein breakdown (18). Furthermore, the anabolic
response was greater with the higher level of protein intake.
Also, previous studies evaluated the anabolic response to
protein or amino acids (AAs) in the circumstance of either the
ingestion of only AAs/protein (34) or the ingestion of protein
occurring in a particular food source (e.g., meat or milk) (20,
24, 25) but not in the context of a complete meal (18). Finally,
previous studies have focused entirely on the response of
muscle, but this approach may underestimate total anabolic
response to feeding. Dietary protein supplies precursors for the
synthesis of all proteins in the body. Furthermore, AAs taken
up and incorporated into proteins in rapid turnover tissues such
as the gut can be later released into systemic circulation and
used for synthesis of protein in other tissues, including muscle
(13, 14). A further consideration of potential importance is the
nature and amount of prior physical activity before a meal. For
example, it has been shown that resistance exercise stimulates
MPS (28). Despite the stimulation of MPS, even resistance
exercise may not result in a positive NB in the fasting state
because of the simultaneous increase in muscle protein break-
down (MPB) (28). However, prior resistance exercise may
amplify the normal stimulatory effect of protein/AA intake
alone (28). Thus it is reasonable to examine whole body effects
of exercise in the context of quantifying the anabolic response
to different levels of dietary protein.
In the current study we have quantified protein kinetics
[protein synthesis (PS), breakdown (PB), and net balance
(NB)] at the whole body level before and throughout the
response to two levels of protein intake in mixed meals with or
without prior resistance exercise in healthy young adults. We
hypothesized that 1) the whole body net anabolic response

with 40 g protein in mixed meals; and 2) the whole body net
anabolic response to either level of dietary protein in mixed
meals would be greater following resistance exercise.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Subjects. Twenty-three healthy subjects [18–40 yr] were recruited
from the Little Rock area using local newspaper advertisements and
flyers posted around the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences
(UAMS) campus and the Little Rock area. Upon their first visit to the
laboratory, a battery of medical tests was performed to determine
subject eligibility, including medical history, blood count, plasma
electrolytes, blood glucose concentration, and liver and renal function
tests. Exclusion criteria ruled out subjects with diabetes, active ma-
lignancy within the past 6 mo, gastrointestinal bypass surgery, a
chronic inflammatory disease, low hematocrit or hemoglobin concen-
tration, low platelets, concomitant use of corticosteroids, any unstable
medical conditions, and subjects who performed resistance exercise
more than once per week. Eligible subjects were then randomly
assigned to the resistance exercise group (X) or the resting group (R).
Subjects assigned to the exercise group were then tested for determi-
nation of their one-repetition maximum (1RM, the heaviest weight
lifted one time) of four different exercises (see Exercise protocol) at
least 4 days apart from the start of the study. Written informed consent
was obtained from all subjects, and the study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board at the UAMS.
Experimental protocol. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (QDR-
4500A; Holologic, Waltham, MA) was performed for determination
of body composition during the screening for subject eligibility (Table
1). Subjects were randomly assigned by a study coordinator to
resistance exercise (X) or resting groups (R) and studied at two levels
of protein intake in the form of 40 g [moderate protein (MP)] vs. 70
g [high protein (HP)] in mixed meals administered, in random order
with �1-wk interval between the two levels of protein intake. The
primary source of protein in each meal was beef patties. Subjects were
instructed to abstain from strenuous physical activity for �72 h before
the initiation of the metabolic study. Meals were provided in the 3-day
run-in period before the metabolic study on day 4. All foods, includ-
ing the interventional meals on day 4, were prepared by a study
dietician in the Metabolic Kitchen at the Reynolds Institute on Aging
(RIOA) (Table 2). The first 3 days served as dietary normalization
period. Subjects obtained the 3-day meal allotments from our study
coordinator and were also given a dietary record and point-and-shoot
digital camera. Subjects were asked to record time of meal consump-
tion and percentage of meal consumption and to photograph the meal
before and after consumption. Subjects were instructed to return all
unused or empty meal/supplement packaging and camera on the
morning of the fourth day when they reported to the RIOA for the
metabolic study. These data helped the research dietician ascertain
caloric/protein intake as well as study compliance. Subjects who
achieved a minimum compliance of 80% consumption of meals
progressed to the metabolic study.
Preparation of interventional meals. We purchased 85% lean
ground beef from a local grocery and formed them into patties
weighing 113.4 g (4 oz) or 283.5 g (10 oz) of the beef (precooked/
raw). The beef patties were cooked each in a skillet on a gas burning
stove until fully cooked. The cooked beef patties were then individ-
ually packaged and were stored frozen at �18°C. The non-beef
component of the meals was also prepared in advance in the Meta-
bolic Kitchen and stored frozen at �18°C. The beef meals were
thawed overnight under refrigeration at 4°C before being served. The
meals were microwaved before service. The protein content was �19
g per 100 g raw beef.
Exercise protocol. The resistance exercise bout consisted of 3 sets
of 10 repetitions of bench press, lateralis pull-down, leg press, and leg
extension each at 80% of 1 repetition maximum (1 RM, the maximum
weight that can be lifted for 1 repetition). Each set was completed
within 30 s. The rest interval between sets was �2 min, and the entire
exercise bout was completed in �45–50 min.
Stable isotope tracer infusion protocol. The 7-h tracer infusion
protocol is presented in Fig. 1. On the fourth day, subjects reported to
the RIOA after an overnight (after 2200) fast. Subjects in the exercise
group performed resistance exercise as described above and then
rested on a bed for 1 h. During this resting period (both groups), two
polyethylene catheters were placed into each lower arm; one for the
infusion of stable isotope tracers and the other for “arterialized” blood
sampling via a heating box (1). Before the infusion of tracers, a baseline
blood sample was collected to determine background isotopic enrich-
ments. For determination of PS, PB, and NB at the whole body level,
primed continuous infusions of L-[2H5]phenylalanine (prime, 5.04 �mol/
kg; rate, 5.04 �mol·kg�1·h�1) and L-[2H2]tyrosine (prime, 2.16 �mol/
kg; rate, 1.995 �mol·kg�1·h�1) were performed. To appropriately
reach isotopic equilibrium of L-[ 2H4]tyrosine enrichment derived
from
L-[2H5]phenylalanine
tracer
infused,
a
priming
dose
of
L-[2H4]tyrosine was also injected (prime: 5.04 �mol/kg). All isotope
tracers were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (An-
dover, MA). Blood samples were taken at 0, 150, and 180 min before
a meal intake (the fasted blood samples) and at 200, 220, 240, 270,
300, 330, 360, 390, and 420 min to measure tracer enrichment and
plasma responses of AAs, glucose, and insulin. A total of 12 blood
samples were taken during the study (�100 ml). Muscle samples were
obtained before meal intake (at �180 min) and at the end of the
metabolic study (at 420 min) from vastus lateralis muscles to deter-
mine muscle protein fractional synthetic responses to respective meal
intake.
Calculations. Whole body protein kinetics were calculated based
on the determinations of the rate of appearance (Ra) into the plasma of
phenylalanine and tyrosine and the fractional Ra of endogenous
tyrosine converted from phenylalanine as in the previous study (18).
Briefly, area under the curve (AUC) of plasma enrichments of phe-
nylalanine and tyrosine tracers (Fig. 2) was calculated using Graphpad
Prism 5 for Mac (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA) to account for
variations in postmeal tracer kinetics (18, 32). Whole body protein
kinetics were calculated by dividing kinetic values of phenylalanine
by its fractional contribution to protein (4%) (5). For the calculations
for whole body protein breakdown rate, contribution from exogenous
meal and tracers infused were subtracted from total Ra. The following
equations were used for the calculations of whole body protein
kinetics:

Enrichment (E) is expressed as tracer-to-tracee ratio (TTR) or mole
percent excess (MPE), calculated as TTR/(TTR � 1). TTR was used
for calculations of PB whereas MPE was used for calculations of PS.
E is enrichment of respective tracers. F is the tracer infusion rate into
a venous site: FPhe for phenylalanine tracer. ETyr M�4 and EPhe M�5
are plasma enrichments of tyrosine tracers at M�4 and M�5 relative
to M�0, respectively. The correction factor of 25 is for conversion of
value for phenylalanine to protein based on the assumption that
contribution of phenylalanine to protein is 4% (100/4 � 25) (5). PRO
is the amount of exogenous protein (g) that was the amount of AAs
appearing in the circulation as a result of the exogenous protein
digestion, accounting for splanchnic extraction (29%) of AAs in
young adults (30). Phe hydroxylation rate is the rate of appearance
of tyrosine derived from phenylalanine through process of hy-
droxylation. Calculation of MPS was performed as previously
described (18). EBP1 and EBP2 are the enrichments of protein bound
L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine in the first and second muscle biopsies,
respectively, and Em is the mean plasma enrichment (180 � 420
min) of the L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine. t I ¡ is the duration of time
in minutes elapsed between two muscle biopsies; 60 and 100 are
factors used to express MPS in percent per hour.
Analytic methods. Plasma samples were processed as previously
described before determination of enrichment by gas chromatography-
mass spectrometry (GCMS: Models 7890A/5975; Agilent Technolo-
gies, Santa Clara CA) (18). Briefly, 125 ul of 10% sulfosalicylic
acid were added to plasma samples to precipitate protein. Plasma
free AAs were then extracted from 300 ul supernatant fluid by
cation exchange chromatography (Strata-X-C; Phenomenex, Tor-
rance, CA) and dried under Speed Vac (Savant Instruments,
Farmingdale, NY). Enrichments of phenylalanine and tyrosine
were measured on the tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivative with the
use of GCMS (18, 29). Ions of mass to charge ratios of 234, 235,
and 239 for phenylalanine and of 466, 467, 468, and 470 for
tyrosine were monitored with electron impact ionization and se-
lected ion monitoring. Plasma glucose concentrations were mea-
sured spectrophotometrically on a Cobas c 111 analyzer (Roche, F.
Hoffman-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Plasma insulin concen-

 trations were measured by using commercially available human
insulin ELISA kit (Alpco Diagnostics, Salem, MA). Plasma AA
concentrations were determined by using liquid chromatography-
mass spectrometry (QTrap 5500 MS; AB Sciex) using internal
standard method (12). Preparations of muscle tissue samples ob-
tained from the vastus lateralis muscles at 180 and 420 min were
performed as previously described (18). Phenylalanine tracer en-
richment from muscle bound protein was determined as in plasma
analyses.
Statistical analysis. Mixed effects ANOVA models were used to
analyze protein kinetics (NB, PS, and PB), MPS, and concentrations
of AAs, insulin, and glucose in the plasma. Each model included fixed
effects for protein amount (MP and HP) and physical activity (R and
X). Because this was a cross-over study, factors representing sequence
order and period were included in the model to allow for the assess-
ment of possible carryover effects. The analyses of the AA, insulin,
and glucose data also included sampling time, which was modeled as
a continuous variable. P � 0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant. In cases where multiple testing was necessary, Sime’s
method was used to adjust the P values. This analysis was performed
using SAS (version 9.4 SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Protein kinetics at whole body and muscle levels. Whole
body protein kinetics (NB, PS, and PB) were calculated as
changes from the fasted to the fed states to account for any
variability in the fasting kinetic values (Fig. 3). Statistical
comparisons for kinetics between fasted and fed states were not
made, since the focus of this paper was the response to dietary
intake of protein. There was no sequence (MP and HP) effect
on any kinetics (for all, P � 0.39). In contrast to the hypoth-
esis, we did not find an effect of exercise on protein kinetics
(P � 0.490). However, we found there were significant effects
of protein amount on the protein kinetics (P � 0.00005). NB
was increased in both MP and HP groups, with the increase in
response to HP significantly greater than the response to MP
(for all, P � 0.00001). PS was stimulated in response to both
levels of protein intake, and the magnitude was greater with
HP. Similarly, PB was decreased in both MP and HP groups,
with the reduction in PB markedly greater in the HP group (for
all, P � 0.00001). Although the difference in NB between MP
and HP groups was due to differences in the magnitude of
changes in both PS (P � 0.00004) and PB, the predominant
factor in the difference in NB was the greater reduction in PB
in the HP group. MPS responses following meal intake are
presented in Fig. 4. There were no significant effects with
respect to interaction (group-by-amount), protein amount, and
groups (R vs. X) for MPS (for all, P � 0.25).
Plasma concentrations. Plasma responses of insulin, glu-
cose, and total essential amino acids (EAA) and nonessential
amino acid (NEAA) are expressed as area under the curves in
Figs. 5 and 6. There was no significant exercise effect on any
concentration value (P � 0.150). For the EAA, there was a
protein-by-time interaction (P � 0.00001), which suggests the
effect of protein amount depends on the time elapsed since
ingestion. Furthermore, there was a significant effect of protein
amount (P � 0.001): EAA was significantly higher with HP
compared with MP. For NEAA, there was a significant protein
effect (P � 0.0001) that was not dependent on time: NEAA
was significantly higher with HP compared with MP. Both
insulin and glucose were elevated upon meal intake (P �
0.0001; Fig. 6). However, there was no protein effect for
insulin (P � 0.4053) or for glucose (P � 0.0866).
DISCUSSION
In this study we assessed the response to ingestion of
isocaloric meals that contained either the amount of protein
(i.e., MP) that others have considered to be optimal based on
the effect on stimulation of MPS or twice the moderate amount
of protein (i.e., HP). We found that both levels of protein intake

ANABOLIC RESPONSES TO INCREASING PROTEIN INTAKE IN A MEAL

 resulted in a positive whole body NB (i.e., anabolic response)
and that the higher level of protein intake resulted in a signif-
icantly greater anabolic response than the previously described
“optimal” amount of protein (20, 25). The greater NB with the
higher protein intake was achieved largely through a greater
reduction in PB and, to a lesser extent, through a greater
increase in PS than with the lower protein intake.
Change in protein mass of the body is not determined solely
by PS but by the balance between PS and PB. However, the
important role of changes in PB in amplifying the anabolic
response to increased dietary protein in the context of mixed
meals has been largely ignored. The previously suggested
“optimal dose” of protein intake in a meal (20, 25, 31) was
recommended entirely based on the response of PS at the
muscle level. The determination of the true optimal dose of
protein in a meal should also account for the other side of the
protein balance equation, i.e., PB. There is a complex relation-
ship between protein synthesis and breakdown in a variety of
circumstances. In general, PS is closely linked to PB, as AAs
derived from PB serve as the major source of precursors for the
synthesis of new proteins (32). For example, in clinical cir-
cumstances such as in type I diabetes, NB may be negative,
indicating a net catabolic state. Nonetheless, PS is likely to be
normal (26) or paradoxically increased (21). The mainte-
nance of a normal or elevated rate of PS in the catabolic
circumstance of a negative NB can be attributed to the
increased availability of intracellular AAs resulting from
accelerated PB. Since some oxidation as well as outward
transport of AAs released from PB occurs continuously, PS
generally cannot keep pace with accelerated PB in a catabolic
state. If only PS is measured in this circumstance, it would
appear that the individual is not in a catabolic state, whereas in
fact an (unmeasured) elevated rate of PB is responsible for the
negative NB characteristic of a catabolic state. Alternatively, in
an anabolic state in which stimulation of PS is the principal
response driving the improvement in NB, PB may be either
unchanged or increased, but to a lesser extent than PS (17, 27,
29). In contrast to the link between PS and PB in a variety of
circumstances, our results indicate that PS and PB change in
the opposite direction following a meal containing protein.
This is not entirely unexpected, since there are separate regu-
latory factors affecting PS and PB, and these factors appear to
function at the same time following a meal.
Our observation that whole body NB was increased to a
greater extent with HP compared with MP, is at odds with
the previous observation that the maximal MPS is achieved
with protein dose of 20–35 g of high-quality protein (20, 25,
31). However, the previous assertion that an optimal dose
(i.e., 20–35 g) can be based on the MPS response alone is
incorrect. First, the optimal dose is based on an incomplete
assessment of the anabolic response by measuring only PS.
The rationale for using only PS to estimate the total anabolic
response is supported by the results of many previous
studies in which increased NB following intake of pro-
tein/AA alone was achieved through increases in PS without
apparent changes in PB (17, 27, 29). However, in the
context of mixed meals, the main contributing factor to
achieving positive NB appears to be reductions in PB, not in
increases in PS, as shown in our previous findings (18). In
contrast to the previous finding at one recommended dietary
allowance (1RDA 0.8 g·kg�1·day�1), both levels of protein
intake in the present study not only prevented plasma AA
levels from declining but actually increased plasma AA
levels well above the fasted levels. The magnitude of in-
creases in plasma EAA levels in the present study was
comparable to that observed when the protein was given by
itself (e.g., 40 g of protein intake in the exercise groups in
both studies) (20). These findings are consistent with the
notion that plasma EAA levels are the main determinant of

 protein synthesis (10). In the present study, NB increased
58% more above the fasted state with HP compared with
MP, which closely paralleled the 62% difference in the
amount of protein dose between MP and HP. These results
are consistent with our previous observation that whole-
body NB increases linearly with increasing amounts of
dietary protein (18). Furthermore, the linear relationship
between the increase in dietary protein in the meal and the
increase in NB is consistent with our previous observation
in older adults (18) over levels of protein intake ranging
from 6.4 to �91.7 g protein. This suggests that the gain in
NB following a meal is not maximized at 70 g.
In the present study, we did not find a synergistic response
between prior resistance exercise and the intake of protein on
NB, PS, and PB. The absence of an effect of prior exercise is
in contrast to the initial hypothesis that prior resistance exercise
would amplify the increase in NB observed when meals were
consumed at rest. This original hypothesis was based on
previous findings demonstrating that prior resistance exercise
synergistically increased the rate of MPS following ingestion
of either protein or AAs. Results were consistent throughout
tracer methodologies, whether utilizing the precursor product
method (20, 31) or the arteriovenous (a-v) balance method (7).
Although prior experiments involved measurements at the
muscle level, an exercise effect would be expected at the whole
body level as well. Several studies have shown that changes in
protein turnover in muscle are also reflected at the whole body
level (14, 15). There are several potential explanations for the
lack of an exercise effect on the response to dietary protein in
the current study. It is likely that a maximal increase in MPS
was already achieved in the MP. In support, we observed no
significance increases in MPS with HP compared with MP in
both exercise and resting groups. However, it is also possible
that in our study a stimulation of MPS after exercise was
diminished over the 7-h experimental time period (22) as it has
been shown that MPS response generally peaks within �2 h (2,
11). An effect of the meal on protein breakdown is also a
possible explanation for the lack of an effect of prior exercise.
MPB increases in response to resistance exercise (6, 8, 23). On
the other hand, carbohydrate feeding suppresses MPB via
insulin (3, 9). However, insulin has differential effects on MPB
at resting or following exercise. For example, Biolo and Wolfe
(8) have shown that combined infusions of insulin and glucose
abolished postexercise stimulation of MPB but not in resting
state in healthy male adults (8). Glynn et al. (16) have recently
shown a reduction in MPB following combined ingestion of 20
g EAA and carbohydrate (30 or 90 g). Thus a suppression of
PB by insulin may have contributed to the absence of an
exercise effect on NB in the present study.
The mechanisms responsible for the greater reduction in PB
with HP compared with MP are unclear. Plasma insulin re-
sponses were similar between HP and MP, which was to be
expected since the meals contained similar amounts of carbo-
hydrate. Thus differences in plasma AA response between
groups cannot be attributed to insulin alone. We have previ-
ously postulated that intracellular EAAs play a role in regulat-
ing protein breakdown. When the rate of EAA influx into the
intracellular compartment exceeds the capacity of the cell to
incorporate EAAs into protein, intracellular EAA concentra-
tions will increase. Thus, at low rates of entry of EAAs, such
as occurs after a small dose of dietary protein, the rate of
protein synthesis will be stimulated sufficiently to maintain
constant levels of EAAs. However, at higher rates of entry of
EAAs the corresponding intracellular concentrations will rise,
and this may inhibit protein breakdown. Consistent with this
notion, Bohé et al. (10) demonstrated that intracellular EAA
concentrations remained constant during the infusion of an AA
mixture at increasing rates up to 87 mg·kg�1·h�1. MPS in-
creased proportionately to the increases in AA infusion rate.
When the AA infusion rate was increased to 261 mg·kg�1·h�1,
there was no further stimulation of MPS, indicating that the
maximal capacity of the cell to dispose of free EAAs via
incorporation to protein had been exceeded. At that point the
intracellular concentrations of EAAs increased significantly.
The amounts of AA infused over 4 h in the study by Bohé et
al. (10) were �25g (87 mg·kg�1·h�1) and 50 g (261
mg·kg�1·h�1), respectively, which are comparable to MP (29
g) and HP (50 g) in the present study, assuming that 71% of the
ingested protein was absorbed and appeared into systemic
circulation (30). In accordance with the notion, we observed
that MPS did not increase with HP, compared with MP,
regardless of groups. Furthermore, in contrast to the present
study, in our previous study differences in NB between 1RDA
and �2RDA were solely due to differences in PS. This sug-
gests that the amount of protein intake in our previous study
(average protein intake/meal �40 g even in the higher protein
group) might not reach the threshold level above which PB is
reduced. It also must be considered that some aspect of the
reductions in PB may be due to a limitation of the methodol-

 ogy. Total protein breakdown is the sum of Ra AAs into plasma
and rate of AAs that are released from protein breakdown but
directly reincorporated into protein without appearing in
plasma (33). The tracer methodology used in the present study
only determines Ra AA using a representative EAA (i.e.,
phenylalanine), which thus could underestimate total PB if
reincorporation of AA released from PB to proteins is elevated
due to feeding (via insulin) (4). Although total PB might be
underestimated due to the methodological limitation, this does
not explain differences in PB between MP and HP. In addition,
the magnitude of reductions in PB in both MP and HP is far
greater than those of whole body PS. Thus it is unlikely that the
difference in PB is due to a methodological limitation. Taken
together, we found PB was reduced to a greater extent with HP
compared with MP despite similar plasma insulin responses.
This suggests the existence of factor(s) affecting MPB, other
than the insulin response, and intracellular EAAs are good
candidates.
In the present study, we observed increases in PS with both
levels of protein intake above the fasted values. It has been
shown that stimulation of MPS is mainly affected by extracel-
lular (plasma and interstitial) AA availability (10), and sys-
temic insulin response following intake of mixed meals leads
to hypoaminoacedemia via stimulating AA uptake and perhaps
inhibiting protein breakdown (4). Thus, to stimulate MPS, it is
important to prevent plasma AA concentration from declining
by giving a sufficient amount of protein. A decline in plasma
AAs can occur following relatively small amounts of protein
intake in the context of mixed meals, as shown in our previous
study (18), leading to reductions in PS from the fasted state
despite the intake of protein. In the present study, both levels
of protein intake that resulted in progressive increases in
plasma EAA (also NEAA) levels were accompanied by
increases in PS above the fasted states, confirming the
importance of plasma AA availability for stimulation of PS
(10). Although all of our meals contained more than the
dose (35 g) of protein promoted as optimal, we observed
further increases in PS with HP (�70 g) compared with MP
(�40 g). It is likely that increases in whole body PS likely
reflected increases in PS in tissues other than muscle, such
as gut (14) as we did not find increases in MPS with HP
compared with MP. Consistent with this notion, it was
reported that feeding and concomitant insulin response in-
crease gut tissue net protein synthesis (13). Stimulation of
gut protein synthesis is potentially beneficial, particularly in
a situation where MPS has been already maximized. Pro-
teins retained in the gut can be released into the circulation
as a consequence of gut protein turnover and then be used
for MPS (14). This mechanism could be particularly impor-
tant overnight, in which the fasting state is predominated by
PB, with resultant negative NB.
In conclusion, in the context of a mixed meal, whole body
net protein balance increases in healthy young individuals with
protein intake above the amount of protein that was previously
shown to maximally increase muscle protein synthesis. The
increase in net balance was primarily the result of reductions in
protein breakdown, and to a lesser extent, increases in protein
synthesis. Prior exercise did not influence this response in the
setting of our experiment.
