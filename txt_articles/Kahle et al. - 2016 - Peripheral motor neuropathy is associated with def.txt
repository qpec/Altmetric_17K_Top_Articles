Using exome sequencing, we identified a de novo mutation (c.2971A>G; T991A) in SLC12A6, the gene en-
coding the K+-Cl− cotransporter KCC3, in a patient with an early-onset, progressive, and severe peripheral
neuropathy primarily affecting motor neurons. Normally, the WNK kinase–dependent phosphorylation of
T991 tonically inhibits KCC3; however, cell swelling triggers Thr991 dephosphorylation to activate the trans-
porter and restore cell volume. KCC3 T991A mutation in patient cells abolished Thr991 phosphorylation, re-
sulted in constitutive KCC3 activity, and compromised cell volume homeostasis. KCC3T991A/T991A mutant
mice exhibited constitutive KCC3 activity and recapitulated aspects of the clinical, electrophysiological,
and histopathological findings of the patient. These results suggest that the function of the peripheral ner-
vous system depends on finely tuned, kinase-regulated KCC3 activity and implicate abnormal cell volume
homeostasis as a previously unreported mechanism of axonal degeneration.
INTRODUCTION
Inherited peripheral neuropathies are heterogeneous, involving at least 75
different loci (1–3), and are classified, in part, by whether the affected gene
product involves the myelin sheath, axon, or both in sensory or motor neu-
rons or both. Consideration of boththegene mutationand theresulting path-
ological and clinical phenotype is required to develop an appropriate
diagnosis. This classification scheme is complicated, however, because dif-
ferent mutations in the same gene can yield distinct disease phenotypes. For
example, dominant gain-of-function (GOF) duplications in PMP22, encod-
ing peripheral myelin protein 22, cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 1A
(CMT1A; OMIM #601097); in contrast, recessive loss-of-function (LOF)
deletion in PMP22 causes hereditary neuropathy with liability of pressure
palsies (HNPP; OMIM #162500) (4). CMT1A is characterized by distal
muscle weakness with atrophy, sensory loss, slowed nerve conduction ve-
locity, and foot deformities. HNPP is a slowly progressing, pressure-
induced demyelinating neuropathy causing mild symptoms, such as
numbness and pain, to more severe symptoms involving muscle atrophy
and paralysis of affected areas.
The SLC12A genefamilyencodes K+-Cl− cotransporters (KCCs), which
are electroneutral transporters that use outwardly directed K+ gradients gen-
erated by the Na+- and K+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+
ATPase) to mediate the regulated extrusion of K+ and Cl− ions from cells
(5,6).Hence,KCCsplayimportantrolesincellvolumehomeostasis,epithelial
transport, and neuronal excitability (7). KCC3 is encoded by SLC12A6, which
is expressed in neurons and glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS)
(8–10) and in the primary sensory (that is, the dorsal root ganglion) and
motor nerves of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (8, 11). The function
and regulation of KCC3 in both the CNS and PNS are not well understood.
Autosomal recessive homozygous or compound heterozygous LOF
mutations in SLC12A6 cause the Mendelian disease agenesis of the
corpus callosum with peripheral neuropathy (ACCPN; OMIM
#218000) (9, 12, 13). ACCPN patients and KCC3 knockout (KO) mice
exhibit severe peripheral nerve degeneration (11, 14–17); however,
ACCPN patients also exhibit severe brain phenotypes, including mal-
development of the corpus callosum, hydrocephalus, developmental
delay, mental retardation, and seizures (14, 15). GOF mutations in KCC3
have not been identified in any organism, and the clinical consequences of
overactive KCC3 in vivo are unknown.
Here, we describe a child with a severe and progressive peripheral
neuropathy that affects primarily motor, rather than sensory, neurons
and with normal brain structure and function. The patient harbored a
de novo heterozygous mutation in KCC3 (T991A). Thr991 is an impor-
tant regulatory site of KCC3 activity required for normal cell volume
homeostasis, as demonstrated in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293
cells (18–20). We show in patient-derived cells and in vivo with a
mouse engineered with the same mutation that the T991A in KCC3
abolished WNK (with no lysine) kinase–dependent inhibitory phos-
phorylation of this site, thereby constitutively enhancing the activity
of the transporter even under basal conditions. Dephosphorylation at
this site normally occurs in response to cell swelling. These observa-
tions advance our understanding of KCC3 in human physiology, reveal
a critical dependence of PNS neurons on kinase-regulated KCC3 activ-
ity, and implicate abnormal cell volume homeostasis as a previously
unreported contributing mechanism to the pathogenesis of peripheral
neuropathy.

 RESULTS
Clinical presentation of predominantly peripheral
motor neuropathy
A 10-year-old boy presented to the Neuromuscular and Neurogenetic Dis-
orders of Childhood Section at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for
diagnostic evaluation of an early-onset and progressive motor-predominant
axonal neuropathy. At 9 months of age, the patient first exhibited foot
dragging while cruising. At 15 months, he developed bilateral foot drop
and experienced frequent falls when walking. He had no early delays in fine
motor skill acquisition, but at 3 years of age, he had further progression,
from distal to proximal, of leg weakness followed by hand weakness. At
8 years, he required an assistive device to ambulate. At 9 years, he lost
the ability to independently ambulate. The patient reported no numbness,
tingling, hearing problems, learning difficulty, or seizures. Cognitive devel-
opment was normal as assessed by neuropsychological testing. Family
history was noncontributory.
Upon examination at age 10 at the NIH, there were no dysmorphic
features (such as high arched palate, abnormal distance between eyes, or
syndactyly), and he had normal cognition, hearing, and language. There
were no clinical signs of spasticity. He had pronounced muscle atrophy in
his gastrocnemius, quadriceps, and hamstrings, as well as in his intrinsic
hand muscles, biceps, and triceps. He had severe weakness in a distal to
proximal distribution, with near lack of antigravity strength (scoring 2 of
a possible 5) with attempted wrist extension and finger extension and
spread, and scoring 1 to 2 of a possible 5 in strength in all lower extremity
muscle groups. Deep tendon reflexes were absent. Vibration sense, joint po-
sition sense, and pinprick testing were normal.
At 6 years of age, nerve and muscle biopsies were performed at the
Virginia Commonwealth University Children’
s Hospital. The nerve biopsy
showed two nerve fascicles with mild loss of myelinated axons. A neuro-
filament stain also indicated mild axonal loss, whereas Luxol fast blue and
Periodic acid–schiff stains indicated intact myelination. No onion bulbs
were detected, indicating absence of demyelination followed by remye-
lination. Hematoxylin and eosin–stained sections of muscle showed
scattered hypertrophic and numerous atrophic fibers, indicative of de-
nervation. Adipose tissue and endomysial connective tissue were both
increased in focal areas. Notably, there was no evidence of muscle regen-
eration or degeneration, inflammation (infiltration of immune cells),
vasculitis (inflammation and narrowing of the blood vessels), or perifas-
cicular atrophy (reduction in diameter of fibers in the periphery of the
fascicle).
Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was unremarkable and re-
vealed an intact corpus callosum, brain stem, cerebellum, and cortical
folding pattern (Fig. 1, A and B). Comparison of muscle by ultrasound anal-
ysis between the patient and a healthy age- and gender-matched child

 revealed increased echogenicity (an indication of adipose or fibrous tissue),
reduced bulk, and prominent atrophy (Fig. 1, C and D).
Data from nerve conduction studies performed for the patient at age 7
and later at 9 years were compatible with the diagnosis of a progressive pre-
dominantly motor axonal neuropathy with secondary demyelinating fea-
tures (Table 1). At 7 years of age, the tibial, median, and ulnar motor nerve
studies all showed a marked reduction in amplitude with moderate slowing;
the facial motor nerve was also reduced in amplitude. Median and ulnar sen-
soryresponsesshowedmildlyreducedamplitudeswithmildslowing;thesural
sensory response was normal. At 9 years of age, the peroneal motor response
was absent, and median and ulnar motor studies showed a further reduction in
amplitude. The sural sensory response showed mild slowing, and the median
and ulnar sensory responses showed a further mild reduction in amplitude
and mild slowing of conductionvelocity, indicating the presence of milder
sensory nerveinvolvement inadditionto thepredominant motor neuropathy.
Blood counts were normal. The mean corpuscular volume and osmotic
fragilityof red blood cells were normal. Blood pressure and serum and urine
electrolytes were normal (Table 2).
Identification of the mutation in the clinical case
Genetic testing before referral to our center included a negative complete
CMT panel (including PMP22 deletion and duplication testing and sequen-
cing, and CX32, MPZ, PMP22, EGR2, NFL, PRX, GDAP1, LITAF, MFN2,
and SH3TC2 sequencing) and negative targeted sequencing for other rele-
vant disease-causing genes, including SETX, HSBP8, HSPB1, GARS,
BSCL2,ATP7A,TRPV4, andIGHMBP2. Clinicalwhole-exomesequencing
of DNA derived from the blood of the patient and both of his parents was
performed at the Emory Genetics Laboratory using the Agilent V5 Plus tar-
geted sequence capture method and the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing
instruments. Variants were analyzed using bioinformatics analysis through
the Emory Genetics Laboratory, with a “Neuropathy Boost option” to ensure
complete coverage of genes known to cause neuropathy-related disease.
A heterozygous c.2971A>G (T991A) mutation in exon 22 of SLC12A6,
the gene encoding KCC3, was identified (reference NM_133647.1) and
confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Fig. 2A). Parental segregation testing
was negative, demonstrating that the mutation was de novo. This mutation
has not been previously reported in the literature and was not represented in
any of the major databases of genetic mutations, including dbSNP
, NHLBI
EVS, ExAC Browser, or GEM (21). Thr991 is conserved among the four
different human KCC family members (KCC1, KCC2, KCC3, and
KCC4) and in KCCs across evolution (Fig. 2, B and C).
Thr991 resides in the KCC3 cytoplasmic C terminus and is a critical reg-
ulatory residue of transporter activity in response to cell swelling (22). To
predict the effect of this mutation, we generated a structural model of the
human KCC3 CTD (Fig. 2D), using the cytoplasmic domain of a prokaryotic
cation chloride cotransporter (PDB ID: 3G40) as a template. Ala substitution
at this site is predicted to have a functional impact by MutationTaster (23),
SIFT (24), and PolyPhen-2 (25).
Effect of KCC3 T991A mutation on KCC3 function
Given the importance of Thr991 phosphorylation in swelling-induced stim-
ulation of KCC3 activity (18, 19), we assessed the phosphorylation and
swelling-regulated function of KCC3 in patient and parental (control) fibro-
blasts. For positive controls, we expressed wild-type KCC3 or KCC3-
T991A in HEK293cells,whichhavelowendogenous amounts of this protein
(Fig. 3A). In all conditions tested, the T991A mutation significantly reduced
KCC3Thr991phosphorylation,asassessedwithapolyclonalphosphorylation-
specific antibody that recognizes KCC3 when phosphorylated at this residue
(19). The residual signal may represent incomplete absorption and removal of
antibodies directed against the nonphosphorylated epitope.
The activity of KCCs, the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporters (NKCCs),
and the Na+-Cl− cotransporters (NCCs) are regulated by a kinase cascade
involving the WNK kinase family, which phosphorylates and activates

 the kinases SPAK and OSR1 (collectively referred to as SPAK/OSR1).
Activated SPAK/OSR1 redundantly function to phosphorylate KCC,
NKCC, and NCC proteins. WNK-dependent phosphorylation of KCCs in-
hibits their transporter function, whereas WNK-dependent phosphorylation
of NKCCs stimulates their transporter function (26–28). Total abundance of
KCC3, NKCC1, SPAK, OSR1, and extracellular signal–regulated kinase
1 (ERK1) signals appeared unchanged, whereas phosphorylated SPAK
and NKCC1 signals increased upon exposure of the cells to the hypotonic
low Cl− solution (Fig. 3A, bottom), confirming that the cells responded pos-
itively to this treatment, as described (19). Relative to parental fibroblasts,
patient fibroblasts had ~50% less phosphorylation at Thr991 (Fig. 3, B and
C), consistent with the heterozygous nature of the KCC3 T991A mutation.
Phosphorylation at Thr1048 appeared unchanged (Fig. 3B).
To confirm that the mutation altered KCC3 function, we assessed K-Cl
cotransport activity by measuring 86Rb+ uptake under various conditions
in HEK293 cells transfected with either wild-type or KCC3-T991A
complementary DNA (Fig. 4A), or in human fibroblasts isolated from pa-
rental controls or the KCC3-T991A patient (Fig. 4B). Transporters and
channels that can conduct K+ can also conduct 86Rb+, which is a radio-
active ion that can be conveniently measured. To isolate the KCC-mediated
flux,weexposedthecells toouabainand bumetanide, which are inhibitors of
the Na+/K+ pump and NKCC1, the transporters that mediate the bulk (85%)
of K+ uptake in these cells (29), and then monitored 86Rb+ uptake in the
presence of hypotonic low-Cl−, conditions that cause an increase in cell vol-
ume and inactivation of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling pathway and
increased KCC3 activity, and hypotonic low-K+ conditions that also pro-
mote the cell swelling–induced dephos-
phorylation of Thr991 and Thr1048 through
activationof proteinphosphatase-1and pro-
tein phosphatase-2A (PP1/PP2A). We inhib-
ited WNK-dependent SP
AK/OSR1 activation
with STOCK1S-50699, a drug that blocks
the interaction between WNK and these
downstream kinases and results in the acti-
vation of KCC3 by decreasing transporter
phosphorylation, in part, at Thr991 (21, 22).
Both untransfected and wild-type KCC3–
transfected HEK293 cells showed a signifi-
cant increase in K+ influx upon WNK-SP
AK/
OSR1 inhibition, consistent with increased
KCC3 activity. In the absence of STOCK1S-
50699, cells expressing KCC3-T991A ex-
hibited significantly higher activity than cells
expressing the wild-type KCC3. Further-
more, in all but the isotonic low-Cl− control
condition,WNK-SP
AK/OSR1inhibitionpro-
duced no significant increase in K+ influx,
indicating no additional activation of the
KCC3 (Fig. 4A).
ToisolateKCC3activityinthepatientand
parental fibroblasts, we measured K+ influx
in the presence and absence offurosemide, a
KCC inhibitor (Fig. 4B). Both the parental
and patient fibroblasts exhibited furosemide
reduction in K+ influx under all conditions
tested (Fig. 4B). However, compared with
the parental cells, fibroblasts isolated from
the patient had a greater furosemide-sensitive
K+ flux (difference between flux measured
in the absence and presence of furosemide)
under hypotonic low-Cl− conditions, indi-
cating higher cotransporter activity in the
patient cells compared with that in the pa-
rental cells (Fig. 4B). The KCC3-T991A fi-
broblasts have significantly higher K+ flux
compared with the parental control fibro-
blasts; furosemide-treated KCC3 control fi-
broblasts exhibit significantly decreased K+
flux, and KCC3-T991A fibroblasts are also
sensitive to furosemide treatment with sig-
nificantly decreased K+ flux.
We also assessed cell volume regulation
in KCC3-T991A patient fibroblasts and

 parental control fibroblasts, using methods described previously (30).
Parental cells exposed to hypotonic Hepes-MEM (150 mosmol/kg H2O)
exhibited a ~2.3 ± 0.6–fold increase in cell volume (at a rate of 1.03 ±
0.1% cell volume/min) (Fig. 4, C and D), which recovered to the original
volume after returning cells to isotonic conditions. In contrast, the patient
fibroblasts with KCC3-T991A had a compromised acute swelling response
to hypotonic stress (1.4 ± 0.1-fold). These results are consistent with the
hypothesis that the greater furosemide-sensitive flux in KCC3-T991A pa-
tient cells compromises cell volume regulation.
Generation and characterization of KCC3T991A/+ and
KCC3T991A/T1991A mice
Using CRISPR/cas9 gene editing, we created a mouse that reproduces the
T991A mutation found in the human patient (Fig. 5, A to D). To demonstrate
functional activation of K+-Cl− cotransport in this mouse, we isolated fibro-
blasts from mouse tails and measured K+ influx through 86Rb+ tracer uptake

under these conditions, the wild-type cells had very little K+ flux, indicating
very low KCC transporter activity (Fig. 5E). In contrast, we observed a high
furosemide-sensitive K+ influx in fibroblasts from KCC3-T991A heterozy-
gous (KCC3T991A/+) mice under these isotonic conditions, consistent with
the mutation resulting in a constitutively active transporter (Fig. 5E).
We assessed motor function by accelerated rotarod test (31) in two co-
horts of young [around postnatal day 40 (P40); mixed gender] mice with
cohort 1 consisting of 12 wild-type and 12 KCC3-T991A heterozygous sib-
lings KCC3T991A/+, and cohort 2 consisting of 8 wild-type, 7 heterozygous
KCC3T991A/+, and 7 homozygous KCC3T991A/T991A siblings. In neither co-
hort of mice did the heterozygous mice exhibit impaired motor per-
formance; however, homozygous mice (KCC3T991A/T991A) exhibited a
significant locomotor deficit (Fig. 5F).

Fig. 4. T991A increases KCC3 activity and affects cell volume regulation in
HEK293 cells and patient fibroblasts. (A) Transport activity of WT KCC3 and
KCC3 T991A expressed in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were transfected
and exposed to low-Cl− in isotonic conditions (isotonic low Cl−), hypotonic
low-Cl− conditions, high K+ in isotonic conditions (isotonic high K+), or hypo-
tonic high-K+ conditions in the presence or absence of STOCK1S-50699
(STOCK; WNK-SPAK/OSR1 inhibitor), for an additional 30 min in the pres-
ence of 1 mM ouabain (Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor) and 0.1 mM bumetanide
(NKCC1 inhibitor), to functionally isolate KCC activity. K+ influx is presented
in picomoles of K+ per milligram of protein per minute and plotted for both
isotonic and hypotonic conditions. K+ uptake was significantly increased
upon WNK/SPAK inhibition in untransfected and transfected cells [repeated-
measures two-way ANOVA; F(15, 40) = 38.43, P < 0.0001]. KCC3-Thr991
Ala–transfected cells exhibited significantly higher activity than WT KCC3
in all conditions [F(5, 40) = 813.9, P < 0.0001]. (B) Activity of endogenous
WT KCC3 (WT1 and WT2) and KCC3 T991A in human fibroblasts. Cells
were exposed to the indicated conditions and then treated in the same
conditions with 1 mM furosemide (Furo; a KCC inhibitor) for an additional
30 min in the presence of 1 mM ouabain and 0.1 mM bumetanide. K+ influx
was measured and analyzed as in (A). Data from a single representative
experiment are shown as means ± SD. Statistical significance was
determined by two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests (*P <
0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; ns, not significant or P > 0.05). Similar results
were obtained in three separate experiments. (C) Relative change in cell water
volume during acute hypotonic stress in KCC3 WT parental control fibroblasts
and KCC3 T991A patient fibroblasts. Both cell types were exposed to isotonic
Hepes–minimum essential medium (MEM) (310 mosmol/kg H2O), followed by
hypotonic Hepes-MEM (150 mosmol/kg H2O) for 20 min, and then isotonic
Hepes-MEM for 5 min. (D) Summary data of cell volume increase. KCC3
T991A patient cells exhibited abnormal regulatory volume decrease com-
pared to KCC3 WT cells. Data are means ± SEM; n = 3 coverslips or

 To assess overall motor coordination and fine motor movements, we
used the balance beam task (31). The mice first began their trials on the
standard-sized square beam (12 mm). We found a significant difference
in performance between wild-type mice and homozygous mice but no
differencebetweenheterozygousmiceandwild-typemice(Table3).During
the task, wild-type and heterozygous mice quickly traversed the beam with little

presents a 12-bp (TATGAGCGCACA) insertion upstream of the tyrosine co-
don. Only mice #22, #51, #31, and #12 had the desired mutation without
other mutations. (E) K-Cl cotransport–mediated K+ flux was measured under
isosmotic conditions in fibroblasts isolated from WT and KCC3-T991A heter-
ozygous mice (progeny of line #31). Flux was measured in triplicate under
0.1 mM ouabain, 20 mM bumetanide, and in the presence or absence of 2 mM
furosemide. K-Cl cotransport is defined as the flux detected in the absence
of furosemide minus the flux detected in the presence of furosemide. The
experiment was reproduced once with similar data. (F) Accelerated ro-
tarod data (seven to eight mice per group, age P40, and three trials a day
for 3 days) report the time until the animal falls from the rod. KCC3-T991A
WT, heterozygous, and homozygous mice were obtained from heterozy-
gous breeding (line #31). Difference between genotypes was significant
[two-way ANOVA; F(2, 18) = 7.584, P = 0.0041]. No difference was
measured between WT and T991A/+ mice in the first cohort of 24 mice
[two-way ANOVA; F(1, 22) = 3.681, P = 0.0681, or ns].

 to no hindlimb paw slips, whereas the KCC3T991A/T991A mice displayed a ten-
dency to stall, indicated by the delayed time to reach the platform, and
experienced multiple hindlimb paw slips during their crossing (Table 3).
To determine the robustness of this phenotype, we assessed the performance
of the mice on a narrower 6-mm cross-sectional square beam. This size
beam is considered a more difficult task for the mice, particularly for those
that exhibit any limb deficits. On this beam, the wild-type and heterozygous
mice continuedtoswiftlytraversewithlittletonopawslips(Table3).However,the
KCC3T991A/T991A mice experienced greater difficulty in crossing, with in-
tense dragging of the hindlimbs and with multiple homozygous mice unable
to complete the task. Three of the six homozygous mice began traversing
the beam, displaying appropriate forelimb coordination, but would im-
mediately fall due to the dragging of their hindlimbs and inability to
properly place their hindlimbs onto the beam in coordination with the
fore limbs. We scored the mice on beam walking by adapting the scoring
method of Feeney et al. (32) to assign a neurological score to the mice: a
score of 7 indicates that the mouse crossed the beam with no more than two
paws and a score of 2 means that the mouse was unable to cross beam but
maintained horizontal balance for at least 5 s (see Materials and Methods for
details). Overall, we observed a significant effect of genotype on the beam
walk score (Table 3). Whereas no significant differences were observed per
trial within a genotype, there was a statistically significant difference be-
tween the beam walk performance of wild-type and T991A/T991A mice
(Fig. 6A and Table 3).
We also tested for forelimb motor deficits with the wire hang grip test
(31). We observed no significant difference between genotypes (Table 3).
Whereas the mice were allowed to hang on the wire for 60 s, we observed
the KCC3T991A/T991A mice clasping to the wire and thrashing to remain on
thewire. They commonly used their hindlimbs and tail to secure themselves
on the wire. Comparatively, both wild-type and KCC3T991A/+ mice would
often shift their grip to either side but mainly used their forelimbs. Thus,
although the KCC3T991A/T991A mice demonstrated no statistical differences
in their latency to hang on the wire, we observed a unique behavior that
might indicate forelimb weakness. To further assess forelimb and hindlimb
strength, we used the force grip assay, a noninvasive method that uses a bar
attached to a force transducer. All of the mice were first weighed to account
for variability in mass versus force (Table 3). We did not detect any signif-
icant differences in weight or grip strength among the three mouse geno-
types (Fig. 6B and Table 3).
We next assessed nerve function on the basis of the amplitude of the
compound muscle action potentials and the length of latencies using nerve
conduction studies on the dorsal caudal tail nerve and the sciatic nerve (Fig. 6,
C and D). The sciatic nerve and dorsal caudal tail nerve branch provide sen-
sory and motor innervation to the upper and lower leg and tail, respectively.
A decrease in amplitude is representative of axonal loss, and an increase in
latency is representative of demyelination. We observed a trend toward a de-
creased amplitude for the sciatic nerve in heterozygous and homozygous
mice compared with that of thewild-type mice, but the decrease did not reach
statistical significance (Fig. 6D and Table 4). In contrast, we observed a sig-
nificant reduction in the amplitude for motor function in the tail (Fig. 6C and
Table 4). We also observed a statistically significant difference between wild-
type and homozygous mice for the latencies in motor nerve tail conduction
(Table 4).
We also assessed sensory nerve function by increasing the gain to record
smaller sensory signals. Amplitude and conduction latency measurements
were made in all three genotypes. Sensory amplitudes were not statistically
significantly different for either the tail or the sciatic nerve for sensory mea-
surements (Fig. 6, C and D, and Table 4), but the sensory nerve latencies
tended to be higher in the KCC3T991A/T1991A mice compared with the wild-
type and KCC3T991A/+ mice (Table4). Traces recorded from the dorsal caudal
nerve of wild-type and KCC3T991A/T1991A mice illustrate the differences in
amplitude and response latency between genotypes (Fig. 6, E and F).
We assessed the integrity of sciatic nerves using ultrastructural analyses.
Nerve fibers from wild-type and KCC3T991A/T1991A mice were cut transver-
sally to observe the integrity of the myelin sheaths surrounding the axons

 (Fig. 7A). At high magnification (Fig. 7, B and C, for wild-type and Fig. 7,
D and E, for homozygotes), there was no abnormal pathology. At lower
magnification, both genotypes exhibited fibers with double rings of myeli-
nation (Fig. 7, Fand G). These events are indicative of improper initial con-
tact between axons and Schwann cells (33), which can occur under
nonpathological conditions or may indicate a neuropathology. Upon closer
examination, sections of the nerves from the KCC3T991A/T1991A mice also
showed breakage of the myelin sheaths enwrapping the axon (Fig. 7, H
and I). This degeneration seemed to be specific to the fibers showing dou-
ble myelinating Schwann cells, suggesting that individual Schwann cells
attempted remyelination but did not appear to succeed. This pathology
was not observed in fibers that had a single, successful Schwan cell myeli-
nation. We quantified the occurrence of this double myelination breakage
by counting the number of degenerating Schwann cells that was present in
relation to normal single or double myelinating Schwann cells. In three
homozygous sections, we observed 8 fibers with double-myelin breakages
and 67 adjacent normal fibers, thus representing 10% of the total number.
Comparatively, this was observed only once in over 50 sections of wild-type
sciatic nerve.
DISCUSSION
Our report presents the first human with a GOF mutation in KCC3, result-
ingfromde novo substitutionof Ala for Thr at aminoacidposition 991. This
patient has an early-onset, severe, and progressive motor-predominant neu-
ropathy. The regulated phosphorylation of Thr991 (in concert with Thr1048)
is a key mechanism controlling KCC3 activity in heterologous expression
studies (18, 19). KCC3 is normally inactive in isotonic conditions due to
inhibitory phosphorylation at Thr991 and Thr1048 (18, 19). Cell swelling
causes rapid dephosphorylation of these sites by PP1 and PP2A to increase
KCC3 activity (18, 19). When mutant KCC3 that cannot be phosphorylated
at either Thr991 or Thr1048 due toalanine substitution is expressedin cultured
cells, the mutant KCC3 exhibits constitutive activity (18, 19). Computer
modeling predicted a close proximity of Thr991 to Thr1048 in KCC3 (Fig. 2D).
Our patient’
s KCC3 T991A mutation recapitulates the constitutively active
function found in KCC3 mutated and expressed in cultured cells. Further-
more, discovery of this mutation in human and reproducing the mutation in
mouse provided a unique window to gain insight into the role of KCC3
function of the nervous system.
Our combined clinical, genetic, neurobehavioral, and physiological
results implicate this de novo GOF mutation in KCC3 as the cause of the
patient’s progressive motor-predominant neuropathy. We have not yet
identified additional alleles with this mutation in the population, including
patients suffering from peripheral nerve disease. On the basis of the known
importance of Thr991 in the regulation of KCC3 activity and the data we
presented, we propose that this heterozygous mutation causes the symp-
toms of the disease: (i) this mutation is de novo and extremely rare (that
is, this variant is not present in the patient’s parents or the general un-
affected population, as expected for a dominantly acting pathogenic allele);
(ii) Thr991 is conserved in all KCC family members across evolution;
(iii) modeling programs predict high pathogenicity scores for T991A; (iv)
reversible phosphorylation of Thr991 is a key mechanism limiting KCC3
activity and regulating cell volume homeostasis (18, 19); (v) KCC3 ac-
tivity is high, and cell volume homeostasis is defective in the patient’s
fibroblasts, paralleling effects of this mutant protein expressed in HEK293
cells; and (vi) a homozygous mouse model of the T991A mutation exhibits
motor nerve conduction and locomotor deficits. The importance of KCC3
in the nervous system is also supported by the abnormal, pathogenic central,
and peripheral phenotypes associated with KCC3 LOF in both humans and
mice (11, 12, 17).
Although our datawith the KCC3T991A/T991A mice indicated that the pa-
thology predominantly affected the hindquarters (tail and hindlimbs), we
observed that homozygous mice required all four limbs with or without
the tail to remain hanging on the wire. This indicates some forelimb weak-
ness. In contrast to the human patient, we only observed locomotor deficits
in the homozygous state in mice. Multiple precedents exist for dominant
mutations causing human diseases, which can be only recapitulated in the
homozygote state in the mouse. Such an example is lamin A (N195K),
which in humans causes dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction system
disease (34) in the heterozygous condition but in mice requires homozygous
loss to be pathogenic (35). Differences between two species are not unex-
epected. Although there is overall conservation in proteins and function

 between mouse and human, the precise contribution of each protein to a
function is likely to be species-specific because some factors in one spe-
cies might better compensate for the loss of a protein than in the other
species.
Our patient’
s clinical syndrome appears distinct from ACCPN, which
features severe brain pathology and both sensory and motor peripheral neu-
ropathies (nearly all ACCPN patients lack electrophysiological sensory re-
sponses and have only mildly reduced and slowed motor responses).
ACCPN is due to recessive LOF KCC3 mutations commonly found in
French Canadians (9, 12, 13, 36). In contrast, our patient has an early-onset
and severe predominantly motor peripheral neuropathy, lacks clinical or
radiographic brain pathology, and harbors a de novo GOF mutation in
KCC3. Although the neurological and physiological examination of
the patient indicated the neuropathy to be predominantly affecting motor
nerves, evidence from nerve conduction studies showed that peripheral
sensory nerves are also involved, albeit to a lesser extent. We also de-
tected a trend toward decreased sensory function in the nerves of the
KCC3T991A/T991A mice. ACCPN patients and KCC3 KO mice exhibit
axonal swelling of spinal nerve roots and cranial nerves (9). This finding,
our results with the T991A mutant patient and mice, along with the
knowledge that Thr991 is dephosphorylated in response to cell swelling
to trigger regulatory volume decrease, suggests that either excessive (for
example, T991A GOF mutation) or insufficient KCC3 activity (for ex-
ample, the LOF mutation that causes ACCPN)—dysregulated KCC3
activity—results in peripheral nerve dysfunction, although with some-
what different consequences (Fig. 8).
We show in human cells and in mice that KCC3 T991A abolishes the
WNK1 kinase–dependent inhibitory phosphorylation at this site, resulting
in a constitutively activated species of the transporter (Figs. 4 and 5). Dys-
regulation and constitutive transporter activation likely contribute to a fail-
ure of cell volume homeostasis in central or peripheral neurons with
possible secondary axonal degeneration or loss. Consistent with this is
the finding that KCC3-T991A patient cells exhibited significantly
diminished cell swelling in response to acute hypotonic stress compared
to the wild-type KCC3 parental cells. We propose that this molecular mech-
anismdefines anovel formof CMT type 2. Phosphorylation-dependent reg-
ulation of KCC3 could also affect and thus alter neuronal excitability. In
central neurons, control of intracellular Cl− concentrations is mostly

Fig. 8. Finely tuned KCC3 activity is required for structure and function of the
human peripheral nervous system (PNS). KCC3 activity, schematically repre-
sented on a scale from none (0) to maximal (max) activity, is contingent on the
amount of KCC3 and a balance between the phosphorylated (inhibited) and
dephosphorylated (activated) species of KCC3 in the neuronal plasma mem-
brane. Insufficient KCC3 (for example, as occurs in ACCPN; OMIM #218000)
due to LOF KCC3 mutations (or as seen in KCC3 KO mice) or excessive, un-
regulated KCC3 activity (as in the patient described here with a de novo GOF
KCC3 T991A mutation that abolishes a WNK1 kinase–dependent inhibitory
phosphorylation event) results in severe and progressive peripheral axonal
neuropathy with secondary demyelinating features, likely from impaired cell
volume regulation and subsequent neurodegeneration. Normal humans and
mice, as well as ACCPN carriers and KCC3 heterozygous KO mice, fall within
a “functional range” that is free of significant pathology.

 accomplishedbytherelatedtransporterKCC2,whichisrestrictedtothebrain
and spinal cord (37–41), but evidence exists for colocalization of KCC2 and
KCC3 (8–10), possible heterodimerization (42), and their coregulation of
neuronal [Cl−]i (9). Whether the primary defect of the T991A mutation is
dyregulation of cellular volume homeostasis or altered neuronal excitability
due to altered intracellular Cl− concentrations remains to be established.
The precise mechanism by which KCC3 affects peripheral nerve integ-
rity is still unknown. Disruption in the transport properties of the cotranspor-
ter is certainly a reasonable explanation for the disorder, and data from
various patients show that both LOF and GOF of KCC3 lead to peripheral
nerve disease. At this point, however, we cannot dismiss the possibility that
substitution of Thr991 into alanine leads to pathologies through mechanisms
that are unrelated to the transport function of the cotransporter, although this
seems very unlikely given the known role of this residue for transport
function. For instance, membrane proteins are not present in isolation but
interact with manyother proteins, and disruption of theC terminus of KCC3
might affect oneof these interactions.Similarly, the central versus peripheral
origin of the disorder has yet to be settled. The neuropathy and locomotor
phenotype observed in the global KCC3 KO mouse and ACCPN patients
can be recapitulated by specifically knocking out KCC3 in neurons (17) and
even more specifically by knocking out KCC3 in proprioceptive sensory
neurons (16). Furthermore, severe pathology is observed in parvalbumin-
positive sensory fibers in both global and parvalbumin-specific KCC3
KO mice. Thus, it is clear that KCC3 in sensory neurons is critical for
PNS integrity. It remains to be tested whether a similar neuropathy
and locomotor phenotype to observed in the various KCC3 KO mice
can be elicited by knocking out KCC3 in motorneurons. If that is the
case, we would conclude that both CNS and PNS neurons then contrib-
ute to the neuropathy. In the contrary, this would suggest that motor def-
icits observed in ACCPN patients and KCC3 KO mice are secondary to
the sensory deficit.
It is also possible that loss of KCC3 function affects predominantly sen-
sory neurons, whereas gain of KCC3 function affects mainly motor neu-
rons. Because the PNS lacks KCC2, PNS neurons would be particularly
dependent on KCC3. PNS neurons have a relatively higher resting concen-
trationof intracellularCl−comparedwithCNS(43,44).Thepresenceofaqua-
porin water channels in PNS, but not in CNS, neurons may also make PNS
neurons moredependent onthevolume homeostaticfunctionof KCC3(22).
In motor neurons, both KCC2 and KCC3 are present with KCC2 function
predominant in lowering the intracellular Cl− concentration (40, 45, 46).
Constitutive or unregulated KCC3 activity in the motor neurons would likely
upset the balance of KCC2 and KCC3 function, enhancing Cl− extrusion and
g-aminobutyricacid(GABA)–mediatedinhibition.Enhancedinhibitioncould
negatively affect motor nerve conduction, because GABA inhibits motor neu-
rons, thereby contributing to the neuropathy. Additional work will be required
to fully establish all the neuronal cell types involved in the KCC3-mediated
neuropathies.
Recognition of KCC3-mediated dysregulation as a disease mechanism
identifies the transporter as a potential therapeutic target. KCC3, including
the T991A mutant, is sensitive to inhibition by the loop diuretic furose-
mide, as we showed in our patient’
s fibroblasts. Identification of additional
patients with activating KCC3 mutations may enable their treatment with
clinically approved drugs. Dysfunctional kinase-mediated KCC3 regula-
tion may also contribute to other forms of inherited or acquired neuro-
pathies. For example, these findings may have relevance for diabetic
peripheral neuropathy, a condition associated with accumulation of the
intracellular organic osmolyte sorbitol (47), which is a sugar alcohol
derived from fruit, corn, and other vegetables that is slowly metabolized
in humans and is used as an artificial sweetener. Sorbitol is also an ac-
tivator of WNK1 activity (48).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient recruitment
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Na-
tional Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and NIH.
Written informed consent was obtained by a qualified investigator. DNA
from blood and skin fibroblasts was obtained on the basis of standard pro-
cedures. Medical history was obtained, and clinical evaluations were per-
formed as part of the standard neurologic evaluation.
Cell culture, transfections, and cell treatments
HEK293 and human fibroblast cells were cultured in 10-cm-diameter dishes
in Dulbecco’
s modified Eagle’
s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%
(v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin (100 U/ml), and strep-
tomycin (0.1 mg/ml). For transfection experiments, each dish of adherent
HEK293cellswastransfectedwith20mlofpolyethylenimine(1mg/ml;Poly-
sciences) (49). Posttransfection cells (36 hours) were stimulated with either
control isotonic or hypotonic medium for a period of 30 min. Cells were lysed
in 0.3 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer/dish, lysates were clarified by centrifugation
at 4°C for 15 min at 26,000g, and the supernatants were frozen in aliquots in
liquid nitrogen and stored at −20°C. Protein concentrations were determined
using the Bradford method. Where indicated, cells were treated with the in-
dicated concentrations of the SPAK/OSR1 CCT domain inhibitor
STOCK1S-50699 (50), which was purchased from InterBioScreen Ltd.

to residues 319 to 331 of human OSR1 in which the sequence is RRVPGS
(S)GRLHKT]; OSR1 total antibody (residues 389 to 408 of human OSR1);
and ERK1 total antibody (full-length human ERK1 protein). All antibodies
were raised in sheep, affinity-purified on the appropriate antigen by the
Division of Signal Transduction Therapy Unit at the University of Dundee,

Immunoprecipitation with
phosphorylation-specific antibodies
KCC3 phosphorylated at the Thr991 and Thr1048 residues was immunopre-
cipitated from human fibroblast cell lysates. The phosphorylation-specific
antibodywas coupledwithProteinG Sepharoseat aratioof 1mgof antibody/
1 ml of beads. A total of 2 mg of clarified cellular lysateswas incubated with
15 mg of antibody conjugated to 15 ml of Protein G Sepharose in the pres-
ence of lysate (20 mg/ml) of the corresponding nonphosphorylated peptide.
Incubation was done for 2 hours at 4°C with gentle agitation, and the
immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer
containing 0.15 M NaCl and twice with 1 ml of buffer A. Bound proteins
were eluted with 1× LDS (lithium dodecyl sulfate) sample buffer.
Immunoblotting
Cell lysates (15 mg) in SDS sample buffer were subjected to electrophoresis
on polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The
membranes were incubated for 30 min with TTBS containing 5% (w/v)
skimmed milk. The membranes were then immunoblotted in 5% (w/v) skim
milk in TTBS with the indicated primaryantibodies overnight at 4°C. Sheep
antibodies were used at a concentration of 1 to 2 mg/ml. The incubation with
phosphorylation-specific sheep antibodies was performed with the addition
of the nonphosphorylated peptide antigen (10 mg/ml) used to raise the
antibody. The blots were then washed six times with TTBS and incubated
for 1 hour at room temperature with secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies
diluted 5000 fold in 5% (w/v) skimmed milk in TTBS. After repeating the
washing steps, the signal was detected with the enhanced chemi-
luminescence reagent. Immunoblots were developed using a film automatic
processor (SRX-101A, Konica Minolta Medical), and films were scanned
with a 600–dpi (dots per inch) resolution on a scanner (Powerlook 1000,
UMAX). Figures were generated using Photoshop/Illustrator (Adobe).
The relative intensities of immunoblot bands were determined by densitom-
etry with ImageJ software.
K+ influx assay in human fibroblast cells and
HEK293 cells
Human fibroblast cells were plated in 12-well plates (2.4-cm diameter per
well), and the 86Rb+ uptake assay was performed on cells that were 80%
confluent. HEK293 cells were plated at a confluence of 50 to 60% in 12-
well plates (2.4-cm diameter per well) and transfected with wild-type full-
length KCC3 or a human disease mutant form of full-length flag-tagged
KCC3 (T991A). Each well of HEK293 cells was transfected with 2.5 ml
of polyethylenimine (1 mg/ml) and 1 mg of plasmid DNA. K+ influx mea-
surement, through 86Rb+ uptake assay, was performed on the cells at 36 hours
after transfection. In both cases, culture medium was removed from the wells
and replaced with either isotonic or hypotonic medium for 15 min at 37°C.
Cell medium was removed by means of aspiration with avacuum pump and
replaced with stimulating medium plus inhibitors including 1 mM ouabain
and 0.1 mM bumetanide, to prevent 86Rb+ uptake by the Na+/K+ ATPase
and NKCC1, for a further 15 min. After this period, the medium was re-
moved and replaced with isotonic medium plus inhibitors containing
86Rb+ (2 mCi/ml) for 10 min at 37°C. After this incubation period, cells were
rapidly washed three times with the respective ice-cold nonradioactive me-
dium. The cells were lysed in 300 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer, and 86Rb+
uptake tracer activity was quantified with a PerkinElmer liquid scintillation
analyzer. K+ influx was calculated from 86Rb+ uptake and expressed in pi-
comoles K+ per milligram of protein per minute.
CRISPR/cas9 generation of KCC3-T991A mice
A 20-bp sequence (ATATGAGCGCACCCTGATGA, boxed in Fig. 5A)
located in exon 22 of mouse Slc12a6 and followed by TGG as protospacer
adjacent motif was selected for guide RNA targeting sequence. This
sequence flanked by Bbs I sites was added to a guide RNA sequence in
pX330, a vector expressing the guide RNA under a strong U6 promoter
and cas9 under a hybrid chicken b-actin promoter. The vector was injected
alongside a 179-bp repair oligonucleotide into 498 mouse embryos. The
repair oligo contained 83-bp homology arms, a codon substituting Thr991
to Ala, a unique Sac I restriction site, and a few additional third base muta-
tions to prevent targeting of cas9 to the repair DNA. Of 498 embryos
injected, 283 were transferred to 13 pseudopregnant females, thereby gen-
erating 54 pups. At weaning, genotyping was done by amplifying a 479-bp
fragment followed by Sac I digest. Eight Sac I–sensitive (positive) animals
out of 54 (15%) were identified. We sequenced the Sac I–containing mutant
alleles and identified four mice carrying the proper mutation, whereas the
other four mice carried additional insertions or deletions (Fig. 5D). We
selected two lines (#31 and #51) and crossed them to C57BL/6J mice to
demonstrate germline transmission. The lines were then further bred to
C57BL/6J to dilute any possible off-target effects.
Mouse fibroblasts
The tip of a mouse tail (5 mm) was minced using sterile fine forceps and
sterile razor blades in a 35-mm culture dish containing 2 ml of DMEM/F12
containing penicillin (350 U/ml), streptomycin (350 mg/ml), and collagen-
ase D (2 mg/ml) (from Clostridium histolyticum; Roche Diagnostics). The
2-ml medium containing small tail chunks was then added to 3 ml of iden-
tical medium in a 15-ml conical tube and rotated overnight at room tempera-
ture. Thenext day, 5ml of complete DMEM/F12medium[10% fetal bovine
serum, penicillin (150 U/ml), and streptomycin (150 mg/ml)] was added to
each tube, and the remaining large pieces of tails were allowed to sediment
by gravity to the bottom of the tube (1 to 2 min). The supernatant (10 ml)
was recovered, placed in new tubes, and spun at 150g for 4 min. The super-
natants were aspirated, and the pellets were resuspended in 0.5-ml complete
DMEM/F12 medium and placed in a 24-well plate for growth. Upon con-
fluence, the cells were detached and successively moved to 35- and 100-mm
plates.
86Rb+ uptake in mouse fibroblasts
Dishes (35 mm) were coated with 1 ml of water containing poly-D-lysine
(0.1 mg/ml) overnight in a 37°C incubator. The dishes were then rinsed
twice with 1 ml of water and covered with 2 ml of fibroblasts (1 × 10–cm
dish resuspended in 16 ml of medium or 1:8 splitting ratio) for 2 hours of
incubation at 37°C to allow the cells to stick. All dishes were plated from
the same cell resuspension, thereby guaranteeing equal seeding. After
2 hours, the dishes were moved to room temperature and preincubated for
15 to 20 min in an isosmotic solution containing 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl,
2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 5 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), and 1 mM glucose. At
the end of the preincubation period, the medium was aspirated and replaced
with identical solution containing 100 mM ouabain, 20 mM bumetanide, and
86Rb+ (1 mCi/ml) in the presence or absence of 2 mM furosemide. After the
15-min 86Rb+ uptake, the dishes were washed three times with ice-cold
buffer, exposed to 500 ml of 0.25 N NaOH for 1 hour, and neutralized with
250 ml of acetic acid glacial. Samples of 300 ml were added to 5 ml of scin-
tillation fluid in glass vials for 86Rb+ counts, and samples of 30 mlwere used
for protein assay (Bio-Rad). Each condition was done in triplicates, and K+
flux was calculated from 86Rb+ counts [counts per min (cpm)] and

is based on measuring and averaging the counts (cpm) of 5 ml of aliquots of
radioactive extracellular solution and relating these counts to the amount of
K+ contained in these aliquots (1 cpm = 2.5 pmol K+).
Cell volume experiments
Cell volume changes in patient and parental cells were determined using
calcein as a marker of intracellular water volume as described previously
(20). Briefly, cells on coverslips were incubated with 0.5 mM calcein acet-
oxymethyl for 30 min at 37°C. The cells were placed in a heated (37°C)
imaging chamber (Warner Instruments) on a Nikon Ti Eclipse inverted epi-
fluorescence microscope equipped with perfect focus, a 40× Super Fluor oil
immersion objective lens, and a Princeton Instruments MicroMAX CCD
camera. Calcein fluorescence was monitored using a fluorescein isothio-
cyanate filter set (excitation, 480 nm; emission, 535 nm; Chroma Technol-
ogy). Images were collected every 60 s with MetaFluor image acquisition
software (Molecular Devices), and regions of interest (~10 to 15 cells) were
selected. Baseline drift resulting from photobleaching and dye leakage was
corrected as described previously (30). The fluorescence changewas plotted
as a function of the reciprocal of the relative osmotic pressure, and the re-
sulting calibration curve was applied to all subsequent experiments as pre-
viously described (30). The Hepes-buffered isotonic solution contained (pH
7.4) 100 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.3 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM MgSO4, 20 mM
Hepes, 5.5 mM glucose, 0.4 mM NaHC03, and 70 mM sucrose with 310
mosmol determined using an osmometer (Advanced Instruments). Anisos-
motic solutions (150 and 280 mosmol) were prepared by removal or addi-
tion of sucrose to the above solution.
Accelerated rotarod assay
A neuromotor coordination task was performed using an accelerating rotat-
ing cylinder (model 47600; Ugo Basile, S.R. Biological Research Appara-
tus) in two cohorts of mice: 12 wild-type mice and 12 heterozygous T991A
mice, and 8 wild-type, 7 heterozygous, and 7 homozygous mice. The cyl-
inder was 3 cm in diameter and was covered with scored plastic. Mice were
confined to a 4-cm-long section of the cylinder by gray Plexiglass dividers.
Two to five micewere placed on the cylinder at once. The rotation rate of the
cylinder increased over a4-minperiodfrom4 to 40rpm. The latencyof each
mouse to fall off the rotating cylinder was automatically recorded by the
device. Mice that remained on the rotarod during the 300-s trial period were
removed and given a score of 300 s. The test was performed at three trials
daily for three consecutive days with an intertrial interval of at least 30 min.
Wire hang grip test
To assess forelimb strength and coordination, we used the wire hang grip
test. The wire was 50 cm long and 2 mm in diameter. The string was about
33.5 cm above the table surface with bedding placed underneath to prevent
injury to any mice that fell. We trained the mice for two trials followed by
three test trials in 1 day. The mice were allowed to hang on the wire for a
maximum of 60 s, but timing ceased when the mouse fell. The mice were
scored on latency to fall. Those that did not fall were given a score of 60 s.
Force grip test
We used the Chatillon digital force meter (San Diego Instruments) to assess
force grip strength in all limbs of the mice. Training and testing were done
on the same day: we trained the mice for three practice trials with 10-min
relief periods between each trial, followed by three test trials. The mice were
allowed to initially grip the wire with all four paws and were then pulled
horizontally with consistent force todeterminegrip strength.We normalized
grip strength values to account for any variances due to body weight versus
grip strength through the formula: Forcemouse/body weightmouse.
Balance beam
To assess motor coordination and balance, we used a 1-m-long steel balance
beam. We used two beams of varying thickness: a standard-sized beam
(12 mm) and a thinner beam (6 mm), both of which had square cross
sections to assess finer motor movements. The beam was placed about
50 cm from the ground and positioned between two pillars. At the start of
the balance beam, mice began on an open, square platform and ended in an
enclosed black box with bedding as motivation for the mice to cross. We
trained the mice for 2 days (three trials per day for each beam) beginning
with the thicker beam (12 mm) and progressing to the thinner beam (6 mm).
Themicewere tested consecutivelyoneach beamwith10-minrelief periods
between each trial. The third day was used as a test day with three trials for
eachbeam. The micehad about 60s totraverse the beam and were scoredon
the neurological scoring system for beam walking adapted from Feeney and
colleagues (32). This scoring system is based on the ability of the mouse to
cross the beam and accounts for the number of paw slips. The mice received
a score ranging from 1 to 7 based on their ability to complete the task, to
place affected limbs on beam, and on the number of paw slips. This neuro-
logical scoring system considers a high score of 7 to be indicative of a wild-
typemousephenotypewithnocoordinationdeficitsandalowscoreof1that
is indicative of motor defects [score of 7, mouse crosses beam with no more
than two paw slips; 6, can cross beam but uses affected limbs more than
halfway along beam; 5, can cross beam but uses affected limbs less than
halfway along beam; 4, crosses beam and can place affected limbs at least
once on horizontal beam; 3, crosses beam but drags (affected) hindlimbs; 2,
unable to cross the beam but can hold horizontal balance for at least 5 s; 1,
unable to cross the beam].
Nerve conduction studies
We measured the nerve conduction amplitude and latency in both sensory
and motor neurons of the mouse tail and the sciatic nerve. Mice were an-
esthetized with isoflurane vaporizer (Vaporizer Sales & Service Inc.) with a
continual flow of oxygen. Body temperature was maintained with a
warming pad. For tail nerve conduction studies, we determined tail motor
latency through proximal stimulation using single Nicolet 0.4-mm steel
needle electrodes (Rhytmlink International LLC) with an additional
grounding electrode. For sensory and motor sciatic nerve measurements,
we stimulated proximally the sciatic nerve. For all nerve conduction mea-
surements, we stimulated at a duration of 20 ms and a stimulation range of
10 to 25 mA, with 25 mA being the supramaximal stimulus. We assessed
latencies and traces using the Viking software, where latency is measured
from initial onset to maximum negative peak.
Transmission electron microscopy
Sciatic nerves were dissected from adult mice, then nerves were fixed with
2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate for 1 hour at room tem-
perature (RT) and then at 4°C overnight. The Vanderbilt Electron Micros-
copy core further processed the sciatic nerves samples by washing them and
fixing in 1% osmium tetroxide solution for 1 hour at RTand then with 0.5%
osmium for 24 hours. The tissue samples underwent a series of ethanol de-
hydration steps (50% for 5 min, 75% for 15 min, 95% two times for 15 min,
100% three times for 20 min) before they were embedded in Spurr resin at
60°C for 24 to 48 hours. Semithin sections (500 nm) were stained with tolui-
dine blue and examined for positioning. Ultrathin sections (80 nm) were
then stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and placed on copper grids.

 zygous groups of mice for the accelerated rotarod, wire hang grip, force
grip, and balance beam behavioral assays, followed by Tukey’s multiple
comparisons test. For the force grip assay, we divided each force value ob-
tained by the weight of the mouse (Force/massmouse) to account for any
variation due to mass differences. For nerve conduction studies, we used
one-way ANOV
A followed by Tukey’
s multiple comparisons test to analyze
statisticalsignificanceamongallthreegenotypes.Forallstatisticalanalysis,we
considered P < 0.05 to be statistically significant. GraphPad Prism (version
7.0, GraphPad Software Inc.) was used for all statistical tests.
Three-dimensional structure modeling
The three-dimensional structure of human KCC3 CTD was modeled by
the I-TASSER server (51). Structure templates against the primary
sequence KCC3 residues 733 to 1150 identified from the PDB database
were used for comparative modeling. The top-ranking template is the cy-
toplasmic domain of a prokaryotic cation chloride cotransporter (PDB ac-
cession code 3G40), which shows 21.1% sequence identity with KCC3
CTD. Among the top five models predicted by I-TASSER, the one with
good topology secondary structure assignment and a high C-score was
chosen. The secondary structure elements of KCC3 were predicted by
PredictProtein. PyMOL was used for molecular visualization.
