Abstract
Importance—The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended the use of aspirin 
to prevent colorectal cancer and cardiovascular disease among many U.S adults. However, the 
association of aspirin on risk of other cancer types, and aspirin’s potential population-wide impact 
on cancer, particularly within the context of screening, remain uncertain.
Objective—To examine potential benefits of aspirin use for overall and subtype-specific cancer 
prevention, at a range of doses and duration of use, and estimate the absolute benefit of aspirin in 
the context of screening.
Design—Two large prospective cohort studies: the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS, 1980–2010) and 
Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS, 1986–2012).

 Setting—Health professionals in the United States
Participants—88,084 women and 47,881 men participating in the NHS and HPFS who reported 
aspirin use biennially.
Main Outcome Measures—Relative risks (RRs) for incident cancers and population 
attributable risk (PAR).
Results—During up to 32 years of follow-up, we documented 20,414 cancers among women and 
7,571 among men. Compared with nonregular use, regular aspirin use was associated with lower 
risk of overall cancer (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.94, 0.99), which was primarily due to a lower incidence 
of gastrointestinal cancers (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.80, 0.91), especially colorectal cancers (RR 0.81; 
95% CI 0.75, 0.88). The benefit of aspirin on gastrointestinal cancers appeared evident with use of 
at least 0.5 to 1.5 standard aspirin tablets per week; the minimum duration of regular use 
associated with lower risk was 6 years. Among individuals aged over 50, regular aspirin use could 
prevent 33 colorectal cancers (PAR 17.0%) among those who have not undergone a lower 
endoscopy and 18 colorectal cancers per 100,000 person-years (PAR 8.5%) among those who 
have. Regular aspirin use was not associated with risk of breast, advanced prostate, or lung cancer.
Conclusions and Relevance—Long-term aspirin use was associated with modest but 
significantly reduced risk of overall cancer, especially gastrointestinal tumors. Regular aspirin use 
may prevent a substantial proportion of colorectal cancers and complement the benefits of 
screening.
Introduction
Secondary analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of aspirin for the prevention of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) supports a potential role of aspirin in reducing overall cancer 
incidence. In six trials of daily low-dose aspirin (75 mg and above), aspirin was associated 
with a relative risk (RR) of 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66, 0.88) for overall cancer 
after 3 years, with benefit increasing with longer duration.1 However, the number of cancers 
was too limited to reliably establish effects on specific cancer types and uncertainties remain 
in relation to the optimum dose and duration of use. With 10 years of active intervention and 
another 8 years of post-trial follow-up, the Women’s Health Study found no association 
between alternate-day low-dose aspirin (100 mg) and overall risk of cancer (RR 0.97; 95% 
CI 0.92, 1.03), but a significant risk reduction for colorectal cancer (CRC) (RR 0.80; 95% CI 
0.67, 0.97).2
Prospective data on the association of aspirin with overall cancer within a single, well-
characterized population are limited to an analysis of the Cancer Prevention Study II. In this 
cohort, daily use of adult-strength aspirin for at least 5 years, compared with no use, was 
associated with lower overall cancer incidence in men (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76, 0.93) and 
non-statistically significantly lower overall cancer incidence in women (RR 0.86, 95% CI 
0.73, 1.03) over 11 years of follow-up.3 Additional studies have also examined aspirin use 
and risk of individual cancers; benefit appears most evident for gastrointestinal cancers, 
including CRC and gastroesophageal cancers.4–6 However, comparison across these studies 
is challenging owing to heterogeneities in the definition of aspirin exposure, doses evaluated, 
length of follow-up, and timing of assessment.

 In 2007, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against the use of 
aspirin for the prevention of CRC.7 However, in their 2015 updated draft recommendations, 
the USPSTF reversed this position, acknowledging that supporting evidence had become 
compelling enough8,9 to warrant the inclusion of CRC prevention into their rationale for 
routine low-dose aspirin use among certain subgroups of adults with specific cardiovascular 
risk profiles.10 This recommendation distinguishes aspirin as the first pharmacologic agent 
to be endorsed by the USPSTF for chemoprevention of a cancer in a population not 
characterized as high risk.11 However, both the USPSTF and a UK panel have emphasized 
the need for additional research into the effect of long-term aspirin use on not only the 
incidence of CRC, but overall cancer, according to a range of doses and by subgroups, 
including age, sex, baseline cancer risk, or comorbid conditions.12,13 It is also unclear what 
the additional impact of aspirin use on cancer would be in the setting of screening, including 
lower endoscopy,11 which is associated with a significantly lower risk of CRC.14
To address these critical questions, we examined the association of aspirin with incident 
cancer among 135,965 women and men enrolled in two large prospective U.S. cohort studies 
who provided detailed and updated information on aspirin use over 32 years. Our study 
setting allowed a more comprehensive assessment of the potential population-wide impact of 
aspirin at a wide range of doses over long-term follow-up within the context of screening, 
and other medical, reproductive and lifestyle factors than would be feasible in a RCT.
Methods
Study Population
We utilized two ongoing prospective studies; the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), a cohort 
study of 121,700 US female nurses aged 30–55 at enrollment in 1976, and the Health 
Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), a cohort study of 51,529 US male health 
professionals aged 40–75 in 1986. Participants have returned mailed questionnaires at 
enrollment and every 2 years thereafter to provide data on lifestyle factors, medical history, 
and disease outcomes and every 4 years to report dietary intake. The follow-up rates in both 
cohorts have been greater than 90%. The institutional review boards of the Harvard T.H. 
Chan School of Public Health and Partners Healthcare approved the study protocol.
Assessment of Aspirin Use
In the NHS, aspirin use was first assessed in 1980 and every 2 years thereafter, except in 
1986, and the participants were asked whether they took aspirin most weeks, the number of 
tablets taken per week, and years of aspirin usage. In the HPFS, in 1986 and every 2 years 
thereafter, participants were asked whether they used aspirin 2 or more times per week. 
Beginning in 1992, the number of tablets taken per week was assessed. For both cohorts, 
participants were specifically asked about standard-dose (325-mg) aspirin tablets. Between 
1994–1998, participants were also asked to convert intake of 4 baby (81-mg) aspirin to 1 
standard aspirin tablet. Since 2000, participants were asked to report separately for regular 
use of baby/low-dose aspirin from standard-dose aspirin. In this analysis, regular aspirin 
users were defined as who reported aspirin use at least 2 times per week, including both 
standard and low-dose aspirin. Nonregular users included who consumed fewer than 2 times

 per week or no aspirin. The major reasons for aspirin use were headache, arthritis and other 
musculoskeletal pain, and CVD prevention among women,15 and CVD prevention, 
musculoskeletal pain, CVD, and headache among men.16
Ascertainment of Cancer
In each cohort, incident cancers were ascertained by biennial questionnaire reports and the 
National Death Index. Researchers obtained permission from participants or next-of-kin to 
obtain their medical records and pathological reports and abstracted the information on 
anatomic location, stage, and histological type of the cancer. The confirmed cancers were 
defined according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9].
Statistical Analysis
We analyzed regular aspirin use in relation to risk of any type of cancer, gastrointestinal 
cancer (colorectum, pancreas, gastroesophagus, and others that included small intestine, 
anus, liver, biliary tract and peritoneum) and other non-gastrointestinal cancer (breast, 
advanced prostate, lung, and other non-gastrointestinal cancers) in the main analyses. We 
also conducted analysis according to organ site. Person-years accrued from the date of return 
of the baseline questionnaire (1980 in NHS and 1986 in HPFS) until diagnosis of any type 
of cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin or non-advanced prostate cancer17), death or the 
end of follow-up (June 2012 for NHS and January 2010 for HPFS). At baseline, we 
excluded participants with cancer or who reported implausible energy intakes.17
Cox proportional hazards models conditioning on age (months), questionnaire cycle and sex/
cohort (in the combined cohort analysis) were used to compute hazard ratios as estimates for 
age- and multivariable-adjusted RRs and 95% CIs. We used time-varying aspirin exposure 
and covariates (when applicable). The covariates included in the multivariable models were 
established/potential risk factors for major cancers (eMethods and Table 1). For dose 
analysis, we calculated the total standard aspirin tablets per week by combining the use of 
low-dose (converted to standard aspirin tablets) and standard aspirin with their 
corresponding frequency of use within a week and updated the information biannually. We 
also assessed the influence of duration of regular use (years), which summed all previous 
intervals of regular use before each 2-year follow-up. We assessed linear trend using the 
median of each category as a continuous variable, and non-linearity using restricted cubic 
splines. We evaluated if effects of aspirin differed according to strata defined by the 
covariates and cardiac risk factors. We tested interactions by likelihood ratio tests.
To estimate the potential population-level impact of aspirin use on reducing the burden of 
cancer, we calculated the proportion of cancers that were attributable to aspirin use (partial 
population attributable risk [PAR]) controlling for other covariates.18 We also examined the 
potential impact of aspirin, including PAR as well as age- and gender- adjusted absolute 
incidence and incidence reduction, according to CRC endoscopy history among participants 
aged 50 and above.
As a sensitivity analysis, we evaluated the latency of aspirin dose and risk of cancer using a 
lag of 6–8 years. We examined the influence of regular aspirin use and duration (former ≤10

 or >10 years, current ≤10 or >10 years), and time since last regular use among former long-
term regular users (>10 years). We also jointly classified aspirin dose and duration to 
examine whether risk reduction would be achieved with shorter duration for higher dose of 
use. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 with a 2-sided significance P value of 
<0.05.
Results
During 32 years of follow-up, we documented 20,414 cancers among 88,084 women (65%) 
and 7,571 cancers among 47,881 men (35%) (excluding non-melanoma skin and non-
advanced prostate) over 3,245,734 person-years. Over time, regular aspirin users (≥2 times 
per week) were more likely to have diabetes, use multivitamins, have a previous lower 
endoscopy, and consumed more alcohol (eTable 1). Postmenopausal women who used 
aspirin regularly were more likely to use menopausal hormone therapy. Men who used 
aspirin were also more likely to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) 
regularly and have a previous PSA test.
Compared with nonregular use, regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of 
overall cancer (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.94–0.99), which was primarily due to a lower incidence 
of gastrointestinal cancers (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.80–0.91), especially CRC (RR 0.81; 95% CI 
0.75, 0.88) (Table 1), with similar estimates in women and men. Regular aspirin use was 
associated with a non-significant reduced risk of gastroesophageal cancer (RR 0.85; 95% CI 
0.70, 1.03). Regular use of aspirin was not associated with risk of non-gastrointestinal 
cancers (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.97–1.02) (Table 1 and eTable2). Specifically, we did not 
observe a significant association between aspirin and breast, advanced prostate or lung 
cancer.
The apparent benefit of aspirin on gastrointestinal cancers (including CRC) appeared to be 
dose dependent emerging at 0.5 to 1.5 standard aspirin tablets per week or the equivalent of 
a daily dose of low-dose aspirin (Table 2 and eTable 3) and no departure from linearity was 
observed (P for trend <0.001). The estimates were similar after applying a 6–8 year lag 
(eTable 4). For CRC specifically, compared with participants who reported no aspirin use, 
the multivariable RRs were 0.86 (95% CI 0.76, 0.97) for 0.5 to 1.5 standard aspirin tablets 
per week; 0.84 (95% CI 0.75–0.93) for 2 to 5 tablets/wk; 0.76 (95% CI, 0.68–0.86) for 6 to 
14 tablets/wk; and 0.61 (95% CI 0.45–0.81) for ≥15 tablets/wk (P for trend <0.001).
During the first 5 years of use, we did not observe any significant reduction in risk of cancer 
compared with nonregular users. Beyond 5 years, we observed progressively greater risk 
reduction in risk of gastrointestinal cancers (Table 3 and eTable 5) and CRCs (P for 
trend<0.001). Furthermore, the benefit was no longer evident beyond 5 years since last use 
among former long-term users; however, power was limited (eTable 6). A joint analysis of 
both dose and duration suggests that the apparent benefit of aspirin use for both 
gastrointestinal cancers (eTable 7) and CRCs appear with longer duration (>10 years) of use 
for regular users of 0.5–1.5 standard aspirin tablets/wk compared with people using higher 
dosages.

 The associations of regular aspirin use with risk of gastrointestinal cancer overall and CRC 
specifically were similar for women and men (Table 1, eTable 3 and 5) and were not 
modified by age, family history of cancer, history of diabetes, cardiac risk factors, BMI, 
menopausal status and menopausal hormones use among women, multivitamin use, regular 
NSAID use, smoking history and history of cancer screening (eFigure A and B). The 
association of aspirin use with relative risk of colorectal (eFigure B), breast and advanced 
prostate cancer (null associations) did not appear to vary according to history of endoscopy, 
mammography, and PSA screening, respectively.
The partial population attributable risk (PAR), or proportion of incident cancers that would 
have been prevented with regular use of aspirin was 1.8% for overall cancers, 8.0% for 
gastrointestinal cancers overall, and 10.8% for CRCs specifically (eTable 8). Among 
individuals aged over 50, regular aspirin use is estimated to prevent 33 CRCs per 100,000 
person-years (128 for nonregular vs. 95 for regular users; PAR 17.0%) among those who did 
not have a lower endoscopy and 18 CRCs per 100,000 person-years (97 for nonregular vs. 
79 for regular users; PAR 8.5%) among those who did have lower endoscopy.
Discussion
In two large prospective cohort studies, regular aspirin use was significantly associated with 
3% lower risk of overall cancers, which was primarily due to a 15% lower risk of 
gastrointestinal cancers and 19% lower risk of cancers of the colon and rectum. In contrast, 
regular use of aspirin was not associated with a lower risk of other major types of cancer, 
such as breast, prostate, or lung. The benefit of aspirin on gastrointestinal cancers appeared 
evident with use of at least 0.5 to 1.5 standard aspirin tablets per week; the minimum 
duration of regular use associated with lower risk was 6 years. Among individuals aged over 
50, regular aspirin use could prevent 33 CRCs per 100,000 person-years, or 17.0% among 
those who have not undergone a lower endoscopy and 18 CRCs per 100,000 person-years, or 
8.5% among those who have undergone lower endoscopy.
Although the relative reduction in overall cancer risk may appear modest, extrapolation of 
our PAR estimates to U.S. cancer incidence rates in 201519 indicates that regular aspirin use 
could prevent more than 29,800 gastrointestinal tumors per year, which account for 25% of 
cancer-related deaths.19 Although CRC screening accounted for 50% of the overall decline 
in CRC incidence over the past two decades,20 uptake remains suboptimal, with only 58% of 
the eligible population having undergone an accepted screening option.21 Our findings 
suggest regular aspirin use could prevent about 7,400 additional CRCs among the estimated 
41.3 million U.S. adults aged 50–7522 that undergo CRC screening, and 9,800 CRCs among 
the 29.9 million who are unscreened.
Besides confirmation of the link between aspirin and CRC,3–6,23–26 we also observed 
possible benefits for gastroesophageal cancer, a finding supported by some observational 
studies.4–6,26–28 In addition, we found that the apparent benefit of aspirin required at least 6 
years of regular use with greater benefit observed with increasing duration of use for 
gastrointestinal cancers and was evident with use of relatively low dose equivalents (0.5–1.5 
standard tablets/week). These findings are consistent with the secondary analyses of CVD

 prevention RCTs.2,26 However, in contrast with the European RCTs,2 we did observe greater 
risk reduction among individuals taking higher doses. Nonetheless, few RCTs directly 
compared different doses.26,29
Consistent with RCTs and other observational studies,6 including previous analyses from 
our cohorts with shorter follow-up,30–32 we did not observe any association of aspirin use 
with incidence of breast, advanced prostate and lung cancer. However, accumulating 
evidence suggests that, compared with cancer incidence, aspirin may have a stronger role in 
reducing cancer mortality,1,33,34 particularly death from CRC,26,35,36 and possibly for death 
from gastroesophageal, breast, lung and prostate cancer.6,37,38 It is thus possible that for 
most cancer types, aspirin may primarily act through specific mechanisms (e.g. anti-platelet 
effects)39 to inhibit progression or metastases.18 However, our findings suggest that for the 
gastrointestinal system, aspirin may influence additional mechanisms critical to early 
tumorigenesis that may explain the stronger association of aspirin with lower gastrointestinal 
cancer incidence. Such mechanisms include modulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2),39,40 
the principal enzyme that produces pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, including 
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) which increases cellular proliferation, promotes angiogenesis, and 
increases resistance to apoptosis. Aspirin may also play a role in Wnt signaling,41 NFKB 
(NF-κB), polyamine metabolism, and DNA repair.42
To date, few studies have evaluated the potential differential benefits of aspirin in subgroups 
of population defined by clinical or lifestyle factors. In our analysis, the relative benefits of 
aspirin did not appear to differ according to age, family history of cancer and cardiac risk 
factors, comorbid conditions such as diabetes, reproductive factors, and other major lifestyle 
risk factors for cancer including cancer screening. Our study also significantly extends prior 
data by demonstrating that aspirin use may have a substantial absolute benefit among not 
only those individuals that do not undergo endoscopic screening but also complements the 
reduction in risk associated with screening.
The strengths of our study include a large, well-characterized population which included 
detailed, prospective and updated assessment of aspirin use over 32 years of follow-up and a 
large number of cases in which were able to examine the potential benefits of aspirin on 
overall and subtype-specific cancer risk at a range of doses and duration of use. In addition, 
we collected detailed data on potential confounders and were also able to conduct subgroup 
analysis in the context of important risk factors. Finally, our large population-based cohort 
allowed us to estimate the potential absolute benefits of aspirin, particularly in the context of 
endoscopic screening.
Our study has limitations. As an observational study, our results are not as definitive as a 
RCT designed to evaluate the effect of various doses of aspirin on cancer risk. However, 
such a trial is not likely to be feasible owing to the need for a large number of participants, 
prolonged follow-up, and likelihood of treatment crossover given the high prevalence of 
aspirin use in clinical practice. In addition, as total cancer is an endpoint that reflects the 
distribution of specific cancer-sites in the underlying population, our results with respect to 
overall cancer risk may not be generalized to populations in which breast, prostate and 
colorectal cancers do not account for a substantial proportion of overall cancer incidence.

 Finally, the majority of our participants are White; additional research among other race/
ethnicities is warranted.
Conclusions
In summary, regular aspirin use is associated with modestly reduced incidence of overall 
cancer, with more substantial benefits observed for gastrointestinal cancers, especially 
colorectal. Aspirin may be a potential low-cost alternative to endoscopic CRC screening in 
resource-limited settings or a complement in settings in which such programs are already 
implemented, including the general U.S. population in which screening adherence remains 
suboptimal.21 Cost-effectiveness analyses balancing benefits for both CVD and cancer, 
harms such as GI bleeding, and costs of aspirin in the prevention of cancer and CVD are 
warranted. Continued advances in genetic43 and molecular biomarkers44,45 as a basis for a 
precision medicine-based approach to disease prevention may be helpful in identifying 
individuals who are most likely to benefit and less likely to be harmed from the long-term 
use of aspirin.
