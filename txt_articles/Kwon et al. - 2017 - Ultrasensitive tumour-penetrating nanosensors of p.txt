Abstract
The ability to identify cancer lesions with endogenous biomarkers is currently limited to tumours 
~1 cm in diameter. We recently reported an exogenously administered tumour-penetrating 
nanosensor that sheds, in response to tumour-specific proteases, peptide fragments that can then be 
detected in the urine. Here, we report the optimization, informed by a pharmacokinetic 
mathematical model, of the surface presentation of the peptide substrates to both enhance on-target 
protease cleavage and minimize off-target cleavage, and of the functionalization of the 
nanosensors with tumour-penetrating ligands that engage active trafficking pathways to increase 
activation in the tumour microenvironment. The resulting nanosensor discriminated sub-5 mm 
lesions in human epithelial tumours and detected nodules with median diameters smaller than 2 
mm in an orthotopic model of ovarian cancer. We also demonstrate enhanced receptor-dependent 
specificity of signal generation in the urine in an immunocompetent model of colorectal liver

 metastases, and in situ activation of the nanosensors in human tumour microarrays when re-
engineered as fluorogenic zymography probes.
Early detection of tumours offers hope for greatly improved outcomes for cancer patients1. 
For the majority of cancer types, diagnosis when the disease is localized to the organ of 
origin correlates with significantly greater long-term survival compared to when disease has 
spread to distant sites, largely because currently available therapeutics are most effective 
when patients are treated in early stages of disease2–4. Despite the need for technology that 
can detect early stage disease, the predictive value of existing biomarkers used to diagnose 
cancers is limited. For example, recent studies have shown that screening with the blood 
biomarker CA-125 for ovarian cancer diagnosis does not improve patient prognosis5. 
However, screening with biomarkers that are predictive can significantly improve patient 
outcomes: colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality at 30-years follow-up was reduced by 32% 
with annual fecal occult-blood testing6. These studies indicate more research is needed to 
develop biomarkers that are predictive of disease.
Despite the progress in improving tumour detection tools, clinical detection of tumours is 
limited to masses ~1 cm in diameter via imaging techniques (e.g. MRI and PET)7,8 and 
analysis of blood biomarkers shed by the tumour (e.g. proteins and cell free nucleic 
acids)8,9. It is estimated that it can take up to ten years to establish tumours this size from 
initial tumourigenesis8, leaving a large window of opportunity for early diagnosis to improve 
patient outcomes. A minimally invasive tool to screen patients would significantly impact 
patient prognosis. To this end, we have previously developed an exogenously administered 
activity-based nanosensor (ABN) that, in response to protease activity in the tumour, sheds 
peptide fragments that are ultimately concentrated in the urine10,11. Aberrantly expressed 
proteases are promising candidate enzymes to leverage in both diagnostics and therapeutics 
as they play critical roles cancer progression12. While this ABN has shown promise for 
tumour detection in a subcutaneous flank model of CRC, a tool suitable for early detection 
would require magnitude-fold gains in sensitivity.
Whereas the focus of conventional blood-based biomarkers is to identify specific signatures 
that are a barometer for disease state and then develop methods to sensitively detect them, 
our synthetic system has the advantage in that it can be engineered to both maximize the 
amplitude of signal and specificity of signal generation. A multi-compartment 
pharmacokinetic model built as a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) we have 
previously built predicted that a 100-fold improvement in parameters related to tumour-
specific signal generation would be necessary for the detection sub-5 mm sized tumours13. 
Inspired and instructed by this model, we chose parameters to optimize our urinary 
diagnostic with the following design principles: detection of molecular events that are 
conserved hallmarks of tumour invasiveness, minimal interaction with the non-tumour host 
biology, and robust sampling of the tumour microenvironment. We pursued two strategies, 
which we believed would act in synergy: (1) optimal proteolytic substrate presentation on 
the nanoparticle surface to maximize the relative on- vs. off-target cleavage rates and (2) 
increased tumour access using tumour-penetrating ligands. Herein, we engineered our ABN 
platform based on the above design criteria, and achieved sub-5 mm detection of tumour

 lesions in disease models that recapitulate important features of human disease. 
Furthermore, we validated that our sensors respond to human cancer biopsy samples.
MMP9 is upregulated across human cancers
Our first objective was to engineer the ABN based on a proteolytic target that is highly 
elevated across numerous human cancers and that has a fundamental biological role in 
tumour progression. Analysis of mRNA expression data from Oncomine and TCGA showed 
that matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) levels are significantly upregulated across many 
human cancer types compared to healthy controls (Fig. 1a), and can classify cancer as 
distinct from normal tissue, as established by constructing receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves (median area under the curve (AUC) = 0.81; Fig. 1b). Furthermore, MMP9 
mRNA levels are consistent across all stages, indicating it can be used for both early and late 
stage diagnosis (Fig. S1a–b). Using MMP9 as a disease marker may be valuable in 
identifying aggressive from indolent cancers as it is known to play a critical role in the 
angiogenic switch needed for access to host vasculature when tumours reach 1–2 mm in 
diameter14. Therefore, MMP9 activity measurements may prospectively reflect disease 
progression, and not merely detect a byproduct of tumour growth, as is the case with many 
existing blood biomarkers.
We performed MMP9 immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of a tumour tissue microarray 
(TMA), which was blindly scored by a pathologist and confirmed elevated MMP9 protein 
levels across many human cancers (Fig. 1c–f, Fig. S1b–c). Thus, based on our analysis of 
human protein expression and evidence in the literature14,15, we proceeded to engineer our 
ABN as a probe for MMP9 activity in vivo for platform development, and to establish 
design principles that could be applied to other tumour-specific proteases found to be 
upregulated in cancer. Existing point-of-care technologies inadequately access MMP9, as it 
acts locally at the tumour site14 and thus, cannot be assayed from body fluids with high 
sensitivity and specificity16. Further exploration into other MMPs in breast cancer samples 
from TCGA revealed several other biomarker candidates that had elevated mRNA levels 
(Fig. S1e). These proteases could be explored with multiplexed substrates in future iterations 
of ABNs.
ABN optimization achieves magnitude-fold improvement
We pursued two strategies to engineer an ultrasensitive nanosensor: (1) presentation of 
peptide substrates on the nanoparticle surface for maximal on-target and minimal off-target 
protease cleavage, and (2) modification of ABNs with tumour-penetrating ligands that 
engage active tumour trafficking pathways initiated by receptor binding. We hypothesized 
these two strategies would cooperate to increase cancer-specific signal generation.
Extrapolating from experimental observations of enzyme-substrate interactions on 
monolayer surfaces17, we hypothesized surface presentation would allow us to tune 
specificity between on- and off-target proteolytic cleavage rates of our MMP9 substrate. We 
tested cleavage kinetics of an MMP9 peptide substrate (PLGVRGK), flanked by a 
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair, at varying distances from our

 nanoparticle core (Fig. 2a). MMP9 cleavage rates of this substrate increased with increasing 
presentation distance for all substrate concentrations tested (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 μM); as an 
example, cleavage velocity (V) increased from 0.24 to 0.96 nM/s at a 6 μM substrate 
concentration (Fig. 2b). Unexpectedly, this phenomenon was not generalizable across 
enzymes; cleavage rates by the serine protease thrombin decreased with increasing 
presentation length when the same MMP9 substrate was tested, with V (at 6 μM substrate 
concentration) decreasing from 0.29 to 0.01 nM/s (Fig. 2c). Nor was increasing the tether 
length generalizable across substrates; thrombin cleavage of a thrombin-selective substrate 
(fPRSGGG, lower case = D-amino acid) was optimally presented at an intermediate length 
(Fig. S2). Taken together, these data indicate it is possible to significantly augment the 
signal-to-noise ratio of ABNs simply by tuning presentation on nanoparticle surfaces (Fig. 
2d). Optimizing substrate presentation is a possible solution to the challenge of engineering 
protease specificity for synthetic substrates8,19 that has been relatively unexplored in the 
literature and could also be leveraged in other enzyme-activated technologies20,21. We 
exploited the increased on-target and decreased off-target protease cleavage at long tether 
lengths to present the MMP9 substrate on our ABN.
Next, we turned to the question of how to localize our MMP9 sensor to sample the tumour 
microenvironment in a living organism. Passive nanoparticle accumulation via the enhanced 
permeation and retention (EPR) effect is heterogeneous in human tumours22; however, 
ligands can be deployed to improve tumour distribution23. Although tumour-targeting 
ligands may not significantly affect overall bulk accumulation of nanomaterials into the 
tumour23,24, they can increase cell-specific association and retention in the tumour 
environment and positively impact clinical outcomes25,26. Furthermore, we hypothesized 
that the benefit of tissue-level localization is magnified when applied to an activity-based 
system, due to the synergy of the accumulation and enzymatic amplification effects. To this 
end, we employed a unique class of peptide ligands discovered by in vivo phage display that 
mediate active internalization and transport of nanomaterials past tumour stroma and into the 
tumour tissue, referred to as tumour-penetrating peptides27,28.
We combined the dual strategies of optimized MMP9 substrate presentation and increased 
tumour tissue access into our engineered urinary diagnostic platform, described 
previously10. We decorated our ABNs with the cyclic tumour-penetrating peptide, LyP-1 
(CGNKRTRGC), previously shown to increase penetration of a variety of nanomaterials 
deep into the tumour parenchyma by binding its cognate receptor, p32, and engaging a 
secondary receptor, NRP-1, which triggers an active transport pathway29,30. We employed 
an MDA-MB-435 subcutaneous flank xenograft model as a model of an epithelial tumour. 
MDA-MB-435 tumours have elevated p3231 and MMP932 expression. Non-penetrating 
(NTP) and LyP-1 ABNs were matched for substrate valency (Fig. S3a–b) and were 
measured to have a ~60 nm hydrodynamic diameter and a slightly negative surface potential 
(Fig. S3c). Visualization of the fluorescent core of the ABN three hours after administration 
revealed accumulation in the tumour at similar levels to organs (Fig. 2e–g), with a moderate 
increase (~20%) in tumour accumulation and concomitant decreases in off-target organ 
accumulation with the addition of LyP-1 (Fig. 2g).

 We employed our previously developed pharmacokinetic mathematical model as a tool to 
understand how our improvements could affect the performance of the nanosensor13. The 
model is comprised of a set of five ODEs solved in three separate compartments (blood, 
tumour, and bladder) derived from transport and biochemical governing equations (e.g., 
Fick’s Law and Michaelis-Menten kinetics) with variables fit to experimental data (SI Text). 
Based on in vitro and in vivo experimental ABN data presented above (Fig. 2a–g), we 
modified three parameters of the model: tumour protease-specific cleavage ( 
), off-
target cleavage ( 
), and tumour accumulation ( 
) (Fig. 2h). When applied to 
tumours of moderate size (10 mm diameter), the model predicted cooperation between the 
three parameters: increases in detection signal were greater when parameters were input 
simultaneously compared to the sum of each parameter input individually (Fig. 2i, red bar). 
In fact, the model ascribed negligible benefit in detection signal with increased tumour 
accumulation by itself. When we applied the same analysis to small tumours (5 mm 
diameter), similar trends were observed (Fig. 2j). The model predicted interactions between 
parameters to be greater for the small tumour size, suggesting that multi-parameter 
optimizations are important when engineering ABNs for detection of small tumours. Lastly, 
we looked at the potential benefit from improvements in accumulation when combined with 
the other two parameters by measuring the difference in detection signal when all three 
parameters were input versus when just the improved protease cleavage parameters were 
input (Fig. 2k). The model predicted only modest gains in urine signal. We hypothesized that 
the contribution from spatial distribution, tissue-level localization, and overall changes in 
non-tumour biodistribution is greater than estimated. We therefore investigated performance 
of our optimized ABNs in a series of in vivo models with sub-5 mm tumour sizes.
Tumour-penetrating ABNs detect sub-5 mm diameter tumours
In order to establish the smallest tumour sizes that these tumour-penetrating ABNs could 
detect, a urinary test (measurement of peptide fragments in the urine 1 hour after 
nanoparticle administration) was performed at 1, 2, and 3 weeks after initial tumourigenesis 
of MDA-MB-435 xenografts (Fig. 3a). Measurement of ABN half-life in the blood and the 
free substrate clearance in the blood and urine show that signal decays rapidly with half-
lives far shorter than the 7 day intervals between particle administrations (Fig. S4a–b). At 
the time of each weekly urine test, we also measured the total tumour volume per mouse as 
determined by caliper measurements (Fig. S5a–c). Non-penetrating ABNs with optimally 
presented MMP9 substrate discriminated tumours that were ~150 mm3 in volume (Fig. 3b) – 
volumes approximately 3-fold smaller than when substrate was directly presented on the 
nanoparticle surface11. Consistent with the in silico predictions of greater effects from multi-
parameter optimization at small tumour sizes (Fig. 2j), the addition of tumour-penetrating 
ligand improved the detection to tumour volumes between 20–50 mm3, corresponding to 
3.4–4.6 mm diameter tumours (Fig. 3c). ROC analysis for tumour volumes of 50 mm3 and 
greater yielded an AUC value of 0.83 for non-penetrating ABNs (Fig. 3d) compared to 0.95 
for LyP-1 ABNs (Fig. 3e), indicating LyP-1 could increase the predictive power of our ABN. 
Urine signals were also elevated when tracked over time (Fig. S5d–e). The urinary limit of 
detection markedly improved with tumour-penetrating ligands, from 150 mm3 to 30 mm3, 
despite the moderate 1.2-fold increase in accumulation. This unanticipated dramatic

 enhancement may be explained by biological phenomena such as cell- and tissue-level 
distribution, as observed previously in the literature25,26. Although this level of biological 
sophistication was not built into our model, because the collective knowledge of 
nanoparticle-biological interactions is still an active area of research, our result demonstrates 
the value of molecular-targeting beyond simple measurements of bulk tissue accumulation24 
and highlights the need to develop our understanding of tumour localization. Taken together, 
optimized substrate presentation and tumour-penetration led to over an order of magnitude 
improvement (~14-fold) in detection size compared with previous technology without these 
modifications, which detected ~500 mm3 tumour volumes11.
ABNs outperform a clinical test in an ovarian cancer model
Early detection of ovarian cancer could yield substantial improvements in patient prognosis. 
80% of current cases are diagnosed once the tumour has spread past the ovary due to 
inadequate detection methods33. In addition, 70% of ovarian cancer patients relapse after the 
standard of care, and therefore would greatly benefit from point-of-care longitudinal 
monitoring for early indications of relapse. Based on this clinical need, we challenged the 
tumour-penetrating ABN platform to detect low tumour burden in an orthotopic 
disseminated xenograft model of high-grade serous ovarian cancer. The mouse model was 
established by intraperitoneal implantation of the human cell line OVCAR-8 (Fig. 4a), 
which displays surface p3234 and NRP-1 (Fig. 4b), and secretes HE435 (Fig. S6a–c) and 
MMP936,37. We confirmed OVCAR-8 conditioned media can cleave the MMP9 substrate, 
which can be inhibited by the broad spectrum matrix metalloprotease inhibitor, Marimistat 
(Fig. S6d). Growth of tumours can be monitored by bioluminescence tracking of luciferized 
cells (Fig. S6e–f). When implanted into the peritoneal space of mice, OVCAR-8 cells form 
disseminated tumour nodules (timescale of weeks) and mice eventually accumulate ascites 
(timescale of months) — two disease presentations that also occur in human ovarian cancer 
patients. Two weeks after initial tumourigenesis, mice showed no overt signs of illness and 
had an average total tumour burden of 36 mm3 with a median nodule diameter of < 2 mm 
(Fig. 4c, Fig. S7). After intravenous ABN administration, resected tumours showed 
significant accumulation of nanoparticles (Fig. 4d, e) and a strong dependence between total 
tumour accumulation and tumour size (Fig. S7a).
We tested whether our ABNs could: (1) detect low burden ovarian cancer and (2) outperform 
a clinical blood biomarker. We chose to compare our system to the blood biomarker HE4 as 
OVCAR-8 cells produce relatively high levels of HE4, on par with four other human ovarian 
cancer cell lines (Fig. S6b–c). At 36 mm3 total tumour burden, urinary signal from the ABN 
was significantly elevated compared to mice with no tumours (Fig. 4f). This threshold of 
sensitivity is critical as clinically approved imaging modalities can typically only resolve 
individual tumour nodules greater than 5 mm. Additionally, in a retrospective analysis of 
clinical data, it has been estimated that to decrease serous ovarian cancer mortality by 50% 
with an annual screen, a test would have to be sensitive to tumours < 5 mm38. In 
comparison, the blood biomarker HE4 was not elevated to detectable levels at this timepoint 
and was only significantly elevated three weeks post-tumourigenesis, when the average total 
burden was 88 mm3 (Fig. 4f, Fig. S7b–c). A comparison of the predictive powers between 
the two diagnostic systems results in ABN performance at 2-weeks (ROC-AUC = 0.99)

 exceeding the blood biomarker HE4 at 2-weeks (ROC-AUC = 0.51) and 3-weeks (ROC-
AUC = 0.93), with improvement in true positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR; 
Fig. 4g–h). We confirmed that our tumour nodule retrieval methodology accounted for 
greater than 80% of the tumour burden by measuring luminescence pre- and post-resection 
(Fig. S7d–g). The tumour burden remaining can be attributed to uncollected macroscopic 
and microscopic lesions.
The difference in tumour volumes between detection via application of HE4 blood serum 
ELISA and tumour-penetrating ABNs was 2.4-fold. It has previously been estimated that 
early stage human serous ovarian carcinomas have a doubling time of four months38. 
Extrapolating the benefit seen in detection compared to HE4 and assuming a simple 
monoexponential growth model of human ovarian cancer (NT(t) = NT,0e(ln2/[DT])t where NT 
is the starting tumour size and DT is the doubling time)8, diagnosis could occur 5 months 
sooner with ABNs than the blood biomarker. Improving diagnosis time by 5 months could 
significantly impact the prognosis of ovarian cancer patients, especially considering ovarian 
cancers spend on average 1 year as stage III and IV cancers before they become clinically 
apparent38.
Ligand-receptor matching improves ABN urinary signal
Receptor expression on tumours varies by tumour type and patient. In order to engineer a 
nanosensor with versatile tumour-penetrating capabilities, we utilized another tumour-
penetrating ligand, iRGD (CRGDKGPDC), which engages the same active-internalization 
pathway as LyP-1, but binds to αvβ3/β5 integrin heterodimers as its primary receptor, which 
are ectopically overexpressed in a large subset of cancers39,40(Fig. 5a). We applied iRGD 
and LyP-1 ABNs to an immunocompetent mouse model of colorectal liver metastasis 
(CLM), induced via an intrasplenic injection of p32-negative, integrin-positive, and NRP-1-
positive MC-26 cells (Fig. 5b–c, Fig. S8a–c). MC-26 cells are derived from a mouse 
colorectal cancer line and secretes MMP941, which can be detected in the tumour nodules as 
well as in the tumour-adjacent liver but not in non-tumour bearing liver lobes (Fig. 5d). 
Substrate conjugation on iRGD ABNs was at similar stoichiometries as the LyP-1 ABNs (SI 
Fig. 9a). Mouse and human MMPs have high homology42, and we confirmed that mouse 
MMP9 cleaves our substrate (Fig. S9b). A study of ABN clearance in immunocompetent 
BALB/c mice shows no signal is detectable after 24 hours in the urine, 48 hours in the 
blood, and 7 days in the tissues (Fig. S10a–c). This was consistent in the model of orthotopic 
ovarian cancer (Fig. S10d). Furthermore, no signs of toxicity were observed in 
histopathological assessment of tissues 3 hours, 24 hours, and 7 days after ABN 
administration compared with PBS injected controls (Fig. S11).
The growth of individual liver metastases was measured by MRI and was well-correlated 
with bioluminescence signal of luciferized MC-26 cells, allowing us to monitor total tumour 
burden via bioluminescence imaging (Fig. 5e, Fig. S12). We examined nanoparticle 
localization after intravenous administration of iRGD or LyP-1 ABNs and observed no 
changes in overall organ accumulation (Fig. S13a), but increased penetration of iRGD ABNs 
into the tumour metastases compared to LyP-1 (Fig. 5f, Fig. S13b–c). Application of either 
LyP-1 or iRGD ABNs in the urinary test resulted in distinct increases in signal when applied

 to CLM mice compared to healthy mice (Fig. 5g), and compared to mice with sham 
surgeries (Fig. S14). Consistent with low p32 and high integrin surface expression on 
MC-26 tumours (Fig. 5c), iRGD ABNs had significantly improved diagnostic performance 
with relative reporter concentration increases over LyP-1 ABNs (AUC=1.00 vs. 0.86, 
respectively). Urine signal from iRGD ABNs was also more positively correlated with 
overall burden than LyP-1 ABNs (Fig. S14b). As might be anticipated from low p32 surface 
expression in MC-26 tumours, administration of LyP-1 ABNs to CLM mice resulted in 
relative reporter concentration increases similar to non-penetrating ABNs administered in 
the hind flank model (Fig. 3b), supporting the interpretation that presence of the primary 
receptor can generate enhanced urinary signal. ABNs could serve as a minimally invasive 
modality to monitor patients longitudinally after primary tumour resection in colorectal 
cancer, where the majority of patients are at-risk to develop CLM3.
ABN zymography tool evaluates substrates in human tissues
With the long-term goal of translation into patients, we set out to validate that our sensors 
are responsive in human samples. However, the evaluation and localization of protease 
activity on synthetic peptide substrates in excised tissues has been challenging because 
substrates can diffuse away after proteolysis43. To investigate ABN activity in ex vivo 
tissues, we applied a FRET-pair flanked substrate such that cleavage could be monitored 
with fluorescence imaging (Fig. 6a). Combining existing zymography techniques44 with our 
ABN (ABNz) allows the mapping protease activity to tissue localization. Here, the critical 
step involves binding the nanoparticle to the tissue prior to proteolysis, thereby enabling 
localization. When iRGD ABNz were applied to frozen liver metastasis sections from CLM 
mice, signal was dependent on both MMP activity, which was reduced by pharmacological 
inhibition, and binding, which was reduced when divalent cations necessary for integrin 
receptor engagement were omitted (Fig. 6a).
Lastly, we applied iRGD ABNz to a frozen human CRC TMA that contained biopsies from 
tumours and normal adjacent tissue (Fig. 6b). Extent of signal colocalization of activated 
ABNz, integrin, and MMP9 in cells of each tissue core was blindly scored and revealed that 
ABNz differentially responded to tumour tissue compared to normal adjacent tissue, with 
9/20 tumour cores showing high signal generation compared to only 3/20 normal cores (Fig. 
6c). We note that normal adjacent tissues are collected from CRC patients and may have 
elevated protease levels compared to tissue from healthy patients. A closer examination of 
the tissue (Fig. 6d–e) shows examples of ABNz activation co-localizing with integrin and 
MMP9 staining. The finding that ABN-based signal generation correlates with MMP9 and 
integrin expression supports that this platform may be applicable for detection of human 
cancers. Beyond this application, our technology could also be used as a tool to profile 
human tissues for spatial information of protease activity that could support the translation 
of other protease-sensitive technologies and therapeutics.
Outlook
To extend the ABN technology for application to a wide selection of tumours, a suite of 
tumour-penetrating ligands specific for a range of primary receptors could be built by

 incorporation of the C-end Rule motif, K/RXXK/R, which triggers the active internalization 
pathway28. Recent investigation into the mechanisms of these ligands implicates trafficking 
pathways distinct from endocytosis30. In this work, we employed two peptides, LyP-1 and 
iRGD, which bind to different primary receptors, but use the same NRP-1 secondary 
receptor to initiate tumour-penetration31,45. In particular, the iRGD peptide has been shown 
to increase the accumulation and activity of the antibody therapy, trastuzumab45. We note 
that the target of trastuzumab is extracellular HER2, motivating our use of these peptides to 
sense extracellular MMP9. Furthermore, a corollary to the observation that urinary signal 
increases when primary receptor is matched with the tumour-penetrating ligand is that this 
technology can be further developed as a cocktail of tumour-penetrating ABNs to 
noninvasively and rapidly stratify patients based on receptor expression. This tool could be 
used as a companion diagnostic to monitor receptor status in tumours treated with precision 
medicines, such as integrin-targeted therapeutics.
To move this technology towards potential clinical translation, we validated that our ABN 
technology responds to human tumour biopsy samples. We benchmarked our technology 
against the blood biomarker HE4, which is shown to perform well in detecting early stage 
ovarian cancer 46. Our technology was able to outperform HE4, detecting orthotopic tumour 
volumes that were 2.4-fold lower. Based on simple, monoexponential growth models,8 this 
would yield a detection advantage of 5 months. We also note that the median ovarian cancer 
nodule diameter detected by transvaginal ultrasound in humans is 4.7 cm, a tumour volume 
that is ~1500 larger than the volume we detected in our orthotopic mouse model47. 
Nonetheless, it is unclear how the limit of detection in mouse models will scale to human 
tumour detection. While both pre-clinical and clinical characterization and development will 
be necessary to apply this technology for detection of small tumour lesions in humans, 
recent translation of protease-activated imaging has shown promise from mouse models to 
human clinical trials and outlines a path for application in patients26. Looking forward, 
further improvement in protease-based cancer detection technology can be made as new 
cancer-specific protease profiles and specific substrates are identified. Our approaches to 
engineering an ultra-sensitive diagnostic can be coupled with specificity achieved through 
multiplexing of protease substrates10 and targeting ligands.
Methods
MMP9 expression analysis
MMP9 expression data was queried from Oncomine (https://www.oncomine.org/) and 
TCGA (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) where transcriptomic data was available from both 
tumour and control samples. The list of cancers analyzed can be found in the Supplementary 
Information. Expression in tumours was normalized to controls from each data set.
Tissue microarray staining and scoring
Multiple Organ Cancer and Normal Tissue Microarray was obtained from US Biomax, Inc. 
(Catalog number MC5003b). Microarray was stained with anti-MMP9 antibody (Abcam; 
1:1000). Blind scoring of cores was done by a pathologist.

 Synthesis of peptides and NPs
All peptides were synthesized by CPC Scientific, Inc. For recombinant enzyme studies and 
ABNz, intramoleculary quenched peptides were used (MMP substrate: 5FAM-
GGPLGVRGKK(CPQ2)-PEG2-C; Thrombin Substrate: 5FAM-GGfPRSGGGK(CPQ2)-
PEG2-C; FAM: fluorophore, CPQ2: quencher, lower case: D-stereoisomer). In vivo protease 
sensitive substrates were synthesized to contain a urinary reporter comprised of a protease 
resistant D-stereoisomer of Glutamate-Fibrinopeptide B with a near-IR dye for urinary 
detection (Biotin-CGPLGVRGKK(Cy7)eGvndneeGffsar). Targeting peptides were 
synthesized and cyclized (LyP1: C-K(5FAM)-C6-CGNKRTRGC,; iRGD: C-PEG2-
CRGDKGPDC; C6 = 6-aminohexanoic acid linker, Cys2 & Cys3 bridge).
Iron-oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) were formed by reacting iron(III) chloride hexahydrate 
and iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate with dextran as previously described48. These 
nanoparticles have been previously shown to be biocompatible and safe, and were cleared 
from the animal within 5 days10. Nanoparticles were aminated by reacting with ammonium 
hydroxide. Size measurements were performed by dynamic light scattering (Malvern 
Instruments Nano ZS90). For conjugation of peptides to NPs, NPs were first reacted with 
NHS-VivoTag 680 (VT680, PerkinElmer) and MAL-PEG(5k)-SVA (Laysan Bio.) to 
introduce sulfhydryl reactive handles. Cysteine terminated peptides were then reacted with 
the NPs and unreacted peptide was filtered using spin filters (Millipore, MWCO = 30 kDa). 
For experiments to identify optimal PEG lengths, PEG of varying length was purchased 
(Thermo Scientific) and reacted in the same manner. Nanoparticles were stored in PBS at 
4 °C or at -20 °C. Valencies of peptide conjugation and concentrations were quantified by 
absorbance (Molecular Devices SpectraMax Plus). Typical valencies were: ~60 protease 
cleavable peptide, ~5 targeting peptide, and ~10 VT680 per nanoparticle.
In vitro recombinant protease assays
Nanoparticles coupled with intramolecularly quenched peptide substrates were reacted with 
recombinant proteases to identify cleavage velocities. NPs were mixed with 1% (wt/vol) 
BSA (Sigma) and incubated with recombinant proteases (MMP-9: Enzo Life Sciences; 
Thrombin: Haematologic Technologies) in a final volume of 50 μL in enzyme specific 
buffers (MMP9 buffer: 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 1μM ZnCl2, pH 7.5; 
Thrombin: PBS) in a 384 well plate for time-lapse fluorimetry to measure dequenching at 
37 °C (SpectroMax Gemini EM Microplate Reader). Michaelis-Menten constants were 
determined by assessing initial cleavage velocities at different substrate concentrations 
(Prism 5.0). Final MMP-9 concentration was 100 nM and final thrombin concentration was 
7 nM.
Cell culture
MDA-MB-435 human cancer cell line (American Type Culture Collection) and MC-26 
(Tanabe Laboratory, Massuchusetts General Hospital) mouse colon carcinoma cell line were 
cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal 
bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). OVCAR-8 human ovarian cancer 
cell line (NCI-60) was cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) also

 supplemented with FBS and P/S. All cell lines used in these studies were tested for 
mycoplasma.
Antibody staining and flow cytometry
To confirm the expression of targetable integrins on the MC-26 cells, cells were harvested 
with Cell Dissociation Buffer, enzyme-free (ThermoFisher Scientific). Cells were stained for 
αv integrin (550024 BD Pharmingen; 1:100), NRP-1 (AF566 R&D Biosystems; 1:100), and 
p32 (AB 2991 Millipore; 1:100) at 4 °C for 1 hour and probed with secondary antibodies 
conjugated with fluorophores using standard protocols. Cells were analyzed by flow 
cytometry on a BD LSR II Flow Cytometer.
ELISA for ovarian cancer blood biomarkers
Secreted and cytoplasmic levels of human epididymis protein (HE4) were measured by 
ELISA, according to manufacturer protocols (R&D Systems). Cultured supernatant and 
lysed cells from five cell lines were diluted as needed. All measurements were normalized to 
number of cells and secretion time.
MDA-MB-435 subcutaneous xenograft studies
All animal studies were approved by MIT’s committee on animal care (MIT protocol 
0411-036-14). To generate subcutaneous grafts, 3–4 week-old female NCr nude mice 
(Taconic) were injected bilaterally with 5 × 106 MDA- MB-435 cells per flank. Urine 
measurements were made prior to tumour inoculation by injecting either 0.5 μM LyP1 or 
non-penetrating ABNs (by protease cleavable peptide) in 200 μL PBS intravenously at most 
every week after inoculation. After nanoparticle injection, mice were placed in custom 
housing with a 96-well plate base for urine collection. After 1 hour, bladders were voided to 
collect between 100–200 μL of urine. For analysis, urine was diluted between 10- to 25-fold 
in PBS. Reporter concentration was quantified by fluorescence measurement of Cy7 using a 
Licor by comparing to a ladder (Odyssey). Tumour sizes were measured using digital 
electronic calipers (Marathon Management Co.) and volume was calculated as volume = 0.5 
× length × width2, where length and width are the larger and smaller dimensions, 
respectively. Total tumour volume was defined as the sum of the tumour volume in each 
flank. Mice were binned based on tumour sizes and urine signal was quantified for the bins. 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated in GraphPad.
For organ and tumour biodistribution and quantification, mice were sacrificed at 3 hours 
post-NP injection and organs were removed and scanned on the LI-COR Odyssey Infrared 
Imaging System. Fluorescence from the nanoparticle scaffold (VT680) and the peptide 
(Cy7) was quantified using ImageJ software (NIH).
Pharmacokinetic mathematical model
For complete description and derivation of the model, refer to Kwong GA et al, PNAS 
201513. We inputted the measured properties of this sensor by modifying the base case 
values from the previous model. From the data in Figure 2a–g: MMP9 cleavage went up 4-
fold at the 6 μM concentration and thrombin cleavage went down 29.1-fold at 6 μM 
substrate. We used these numbers and inputted them to change the base case values for

 kcat, tumour and kcat, background by the respective fold changes observed. Here, we assume the 
change in thrombin cleavage is abstracted to background proteolysis for simplicity. From the 
data in Figure 2g: tumour accumulation went up 1.2-fold. We updated the permeability term 
in the ODE, knp_tumour by the observed difference. We further modified the nanoparticle 
half-life to match that of our nanosensors. For 10-mm tumour, we used the base case model 
tumour enzyme concentration of 700 nM; for 5-mm tumour, we used a concentration of 7 
nM, which is approximately in the range for such a tumour size.
Ovarian cancer orthotopic model studies
To generate an orthotopic model of human ovarian cancer, 3–4 week-old female NCr nude 
mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2 × 106 OVCAR-8 cells expressing firefly 
luciferase. Tumour burden was measured using luminescence with an In Vivo Imaging 
System (IVIS, PerkinElmer). Each mouse was sacrificed and tumours retrieved from all 
organs in the peritoneal space. Tumours were collected on a glass slide and scanned on a LI-
COR Odyssey with 169 μm resolution. Widths and lengths were measured with ImageJ 
software and tumour volume was calculated as described above for subcutaneous tumours. 
Reported tumour volumes for each group is the average of 10 mice. The size distribution of 
nodules recovered from each mouse is shown in Fig. S7c. Prior to tumour induction, urine 
measurements were performed by injecting mice with 0.5 μM LyP1 ABNs as described 
above.
Approximately 200 μL of blood was collected and spiked with EDTA to a final 
concentration of 5 mM and blood cells were pelleted. Plasma was stored at -20 °C prior to 
HE4 quantification. HE4 levels were measured using the HE4 quantikine ELISA kit 
according to manufacturer protocols (R&D Systems).
Liver metastasis model studies
Immunocompetent, 6–8 week-old female BALB/c mice were injected with 5 × 104 
syngeneic MC-26 cells expressing firefly luciferase in the subsplenic capsule to allow cells 
to seed the liver. After 90 seconds, the spleen was removed to prevent splenic tumours. 
Tumour growth was monitored by luminescence and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
Prior to induction of liver metastases, urine measurements were made by injecting 0.5 μM 
iRGD or LyP-1 ABNs biomarkers. Post tumour inoculation urine measurements were 
performed when tumour luminescence reached an average of 1–1.5×107 photons/sec/cm2/sr.
Toxicity and clearance studies
All studies were completed in immunocompetent, 6–8 week-old female BALB/c mice. After 
administration of ABN or free reporter, 10 μL of blood and urine were collected at the 
indicated timepoints for fluorescence measurements. For tissue clearance and 
histopathological examination, animals were sacrificed at the indicated timepoints and 
organs were fixed in formalin. Organs were imaged for ABN with the LI-COR Odyssey as 
described above before embedding in paraffin and sectioning.

 Histology
All histology sectioning and staining was performed at the KI Histology Core. Organs were 
fixed using formalin immediately after necropsy for 24 hours and stored at 4 °C prior to 
embedding into paraffin, sectioning, and staining. OVCAR-8 tumour sections were stained 
with p32 (Genscript custom antibody; 1:100) and NRP-1 (R&D Biosystems AF3870; 
1:100). MC-26 tumour sections were stained with αv integrin (Millipore AB1930; 1:100), 
p32 (AB 2991 Millipore; 1:100), and NRP-1 (AF566 R&D Biosystems; 1:100).
Application of ABNz
Livers from CLM mice were extracted and immediately embedded and frozen in optimal 
cutting temperature (OCT) compound. Before application of ABNz, liver sections were air-
dried and fixed in cold acetone44. Protease substrates were designed similarly to 
intramolecular quenched probes for in vitro cleavage experiments except fluorophore/
quencher positions were flipped. Fresh frozen acetone fixed human CRC TMA was 
purchased from US Biomax, Inc (Catalog # FCO405a). After hydration in PBS and blocking 
in 2% BSA solution for 1 hour at 4 °C, ABNz were applied and incubated for 3 hours at 
4 °C with and without divalent cation in the buffer to allow for binding but no cleavage. The 
slide was washed and the buffer exchanged with MMP9 cleavage buffer (recipe above) and 
incubated at 37 °C overnight in a humidified box. For inhibited controls, 50 μM marimastat 
was added to the binding and cleavage buffers. Slides were stained with αv integrin 
(Biolegend 327902; 1:100) and MMP9 (Abcam ab137867; 1:500) followed by application 
of the appropriate secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunolabs). Slides were scanned on a 
Pannoramic 250 Optimum (Perkin Elmer) and co-localization was scored blindly by an 
independent researcher.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad (Prism 5.0) or MATLAB R2013b. Each 
set of data shown is representative of studies repeated in at least two independent 
experiments. Sample sizes of n = 7–10 used in animals experiments were estimated using a 
power test with an expected effect size of 50–100% with a variance of 30–50%. No animals 
were excluded in analyses. The investigators were not blinded to groups and treatments 
during experiments. For each animal experiment, groups were established before 
tumourigenesis and therefore no randomization was used in allocation of groups.

retrieved from the intraperitoneal space of a representative animal at 2 weeks after tumour 
initiation. Average total tumour burden at this timepoint was 36 mm3 (Fig. S6b, n = 10). (d) 
Accumulation of ABNs in tumour nodules in a representative animal (scale bar = 1 cm) and 
(e) biodistribution of ABNs in organs (n = 10, mean ±SEM). (f) Urinary measurements of 
ABNs (green bars) and blood measurements of HE4 (black line). (n = 10 per group, mean 
±SEM, Student’s t-test, two-tailed, ***P<0.001). (g) ROC of urinary diagnostic and blood 
biomarker. (h) Calculated sensitivity (true positive rate (TPR)) and specificity (true negative 
rate (TNR)) based on diagnostic cutoffs and ROC-AUC.

 Figure 5. Minimally-invasive receptor classification in syngeneic liver metastasis by targeted 
ABNs
(a) LyP-1 and iRGD both engage the same tumour trafficking pathway but rely on different 
primary receptors. LyP-1 and iRGD ABNs were tested in a liver metastasis model. (b) MRI 
image of colorectal liver metastasis (CLM) mouse with 40 mm3 of total tumour burden; 
tumour nodules are indicated by red arrows. (c) Top, H&E staining (scale bar = 5 mm). 
Bottom, immunohistochemical staining of tumour sections for primary receptors, p32 and 
αv integrin, and secondary receptor, NRP-1 (scale bar = 200 μm). (d) Imaging of tumour 
center, margin, and normal liver in sections from CLM mice. Tumour margin is indicated by 
dotted line and inset is indicated by white box. Sections were stained for nuclei (blue) and

 Figure 6. ABN zymography is responsive to human tissues
(a) Top left, schematic for ABN technology re-engineered for zymography (ABNz). 
Nanoparticles are modified with iRGD targeting ligand and FRET pair flanked substrates 
that increase in fluorescence upon proteolytic cleavage. Frozen sections of CLM livers 
collected from mice were bound with PBS only (-ABNz), ABNz without divalent cations 
necessary for iRGD binding, and ABNz. Tissues were subsequently cleaved in MMP9 buffer 
with and without MMP9 inhibitor and imaged for the bound ABNz (ABNzb; red) and 
cleaved ABNz (ABNzact; green) (scale bar = 50 μm). (b) Application of iRGD ABNz to 
human CRC tumour microarray consisting of 20 colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) 
samples and 20 normal adjacent tissue (NAT) (scale bar = 2 mm). (c) Extent of signal 
colocalization between COAD and NAT samples scored on a scale of 0 to 3 by a blinded, 
independent researcher. (d) Higher magnification of one patient sample containing cancer vs 
normal adjacent tissue from box denoted in (b) (scale bar = 400 μm). (e) Magnified tissue
