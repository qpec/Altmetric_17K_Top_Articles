The bony pelvis of adult humans exhibits marked sexual dimor-
phism, which is traditionally interpreted in the framework of the
“obstetrical dilemma” hypothesis: Giving birth to large-brained/
large-bodied babies requires a wide pelvis, whereas efficient bi-
pedal locomotion requires a narrow pelvis. This hypothesis has been
challenged recently on biomechanical, metabolic, and biocultural
grounds, so that it remains unclear which factors are responsible for
sex-specific differences in adult pelvic morphology. Here we address
this issue from a developmental perspective. We use methods of bio-
medical imaging and geometric morphometrics to analyze changes
in pelvic morphology from late fetal stages to adulthood in a known-
age/known-sex forensic/clinical sample. Results show that, until
puberty, female and male pelves exhibit only moderate sexual
dimorphism and follow largely similar developmental trajectories.
With the onset of puberty, however, the female trajectory di-
verges substantially from the common course, resulting in rapid ex-
pansion of obstetrically relevant pelvic dimensions up to the age of
25–30 y. From 40 y onward females resume a mode of pelvic de-
velopment similar to males, resulting in significant reduction of ob-
stetric dimensions. This complex developmental trajectory is likely
linked to the pubertal rise and premenopausal fall of estradiol lev-
els and results in the obstetrically most adequate pelvic morphol-
ogy during the time of maximum female fertility. The evidence that
hormones mediate female pelvic development and morphology
supports the view that solutions of the obstetrical dilemma de-
pend not only on selection and adaptation but also on develop-
mental plasticity as a response to ecological/nutritional factors
during a female’s lifetime.

emales and males of most mammalian species differ in vari-
ous morphological characteristics, such as the size and shape
of the body as a whole and of soft and hard tissue structures (1).
Sex-specific differences are also well documented in humans and
nonhuman primates, particularly in the pelvis, and various hy-
potheses have been proposed to explain how pelvic sexual di-
morphism evolves and develops (2–11). There is general
agreement that the female pelvis is under obstetric selection to
be adequately capacious for childbirth. However, the exact na-
ture of selective pressures and developmental mechanisms yield-
ing female and male pelvic phenotypes is still largely unknown,
and whether obstetric adaptations involve trade-offs with other
aspects of pelvic function, such as locomotor efficiency and ab-
dominal stabilization, continues to be debated (12, 13).
One key hypothesis discussed in this context is Washburn’s
obstetrical dilemma (OD) (14). In its original form (14), the OD
hypothesis posits a conflict between the evolution of bipedal lo-
comotion (selection for biomechanically efficient, narrow pelves)
and of large brains (selection for large-brained neonates, and
obstetrically efficient, wide pelves). According to Washburn, the
dilemma is “solved by delivery of the fetus at a much earlier stage
of development” (ref. 14, p. 74) than in our closest living relatives,
the great apes. Although the OD hypothesis thus primarily seeks
to explain the early timing of birth and human altriciality (15), it
also provides an explanation for pelvic sexual dimorphism: Se-
lection favored wider female pelves to reduce the risks involved
in birthing large-brained/large-bodied babies, but did so at the
expense of locomotor efficiency (2, 5, 7). According to this hy-
pothesis, the tight fit between the neonate head and maternal
pelvis (obstetric constraints) and the high prevalence of obstructed
labor in humans (16–18) reflect a trade-off between obstetric and
locomotor selection pressures on the female pelvis.
Over the past years, the OD hypothesis has been reexamined
extensively and has been challenged on various grounds (10–13,
19–22). The energetics of gestation and growth (EGG) hypoth-
esis (12, 20, 23) provides a new perspective, proposing that the
timing of birth is constrained by the limited metabolic output of
the mother rather than by spatial limitations of her pelvis. Fur-
thermore, inverse-dynamics models and experimental data in-
dicate that a wide pelvis does not reduce bipedal locomotor
efficiency (12, 13). Because these studies effectively falsify a
major tenet of the OD, the tight fit between neonate head and
maternal pelvis and the high prevalence of obstructed labor re-
quire alternative explanations. It has been proposed that solu-
tions to the OD can be renegotiated (11) through ecologically
Significance
The obstetrical dilemma hypothesis states that the human fe-
male pelvis represents a compromise between designs most suit-
able for childbirth and bipedal locomotion, respectively. This
hypothesis has been challenged recently on biomechanical, met-
abolic, and biocultural grounds. Here we provide evidence for
the pelvis’ developmental adaptation to the problem of birthing
large-headed/large-bodied babies. We show that the female
pelvis reaches its obstetrically most adequate morphology
around the time of maximum fertility but later reverts to a
mode of development similar to that of males, which signifi-
cantly reduces the dimensions of the birth canal. These de-
velopmental changes are likely mediated by hormonal changes
during puberty and menopause, indicating “on-demand” ad-
justment of pelvic shape to the needs of childbirth.

 mediated phenotypic plasticity of pelvic and fetal dimensions but
that rapid changes in environmental conditions may result in
fetopelvic mismatch (10, 11, 23). Obstructed labor thus would
be a consequence of a mismatch between maternal and neo-
nate developmental plasticity (23, 24) or of biocultural factors
(22) rather than an evolutionary trade-off between obstetrics
and locomotion.
On the other hand, indirect evidence for gene-mediated con-
straints on fetopelvic proportions comes from a recent study
demonstrating that mothers with large heads (who, because of
the high heritability of cranial dimensions, are likely to have
large-headed babies) tend to have obstetrically more favorable
pelvic dimensions than mothers with small heads (25). However,
correlation between head size and these pelvic dimensions is also
present in males (25), although the correlation is less pro-
nounced than in females. Thus the extent to which the observed
patterns represent female-specific obstetric selection, sex-neutral
genetic–developmental integration, and/or developmental plas-
ticity remains to be clarified.
Somatic sexual dimorphism such as that of the pelvis is largely
the result of hormonally regulated sex-biased gene expression
(26, 27). Previous research on the development of pelvic sexual
dimorphism in mammals reveals a wide variety of modes of di-
vergence. Several studies in rodents (28–30) suggest that the
pubertal developmental trajectory of the male pelvis deviates
from the prepubertal mode shared by both sexes, presumably
under testosterone influence. This hypothesis also was proposed
for humans and for other primates (6, 31). Other studies suggest
that estrogen effects are crucial for female pelvic development
during puberty (4, 32).
Here we reevaluate the evidence for the OD and alternative
hypotheses from a developmental perspective. We propose the
developmental obstetric dilemma (DOD) hypothesis, which
posits that pelvic morphology reflects changing obstetric needs
(versus other, possibly locomotor, needs) during a female’s life-
time. Given that female fertility (measured as birth rate per year)
reaches its peak around the age of 25–30 y (33, 34) and declines
toward 40–45 y, the DOD hypothesis predicts that (i) sex-specific
differences in human pelvic morphology become pronounced
after puberty; (ii) the female pelvis reaches its obstetrically
most adequate morphology around the age of highest fertility;
(iii) during postmenopausal life, the female pelvis reverts to an
obstetrically less adequate morphology, which is probably most
adequate for locomotion and other functions; (iv) the male pelvis
does not show these developmental changes.
To test the DOD hypothesis, we track pelvic development
from late fetal stages to late adulthood in an anonymized known-
age and known-sex forensic/clinical sample (n = 275) (Materials
and Methods). The bony elements constituting the pelvis fuse
relatively late during development, so that the 3D morphology of
the pelvis critically depends on the presence of ligaments and
other soft tissue structures. Thus computed tomography (CT)
was used to analyze pelvic morphology in the context of sur-
rounding tissues. Pelvic size and shape were quantified with a total
number of k = 377 3D anatomical landmarks. Sex-specific pat-
terns of shape variation during development were analyzed and
visualized with methods of geometric morphometrics (GM)
(Materials and Methods).
Results
Fig. 1 graphs sex-specific trajectories of pelvic shape change
along the first three principal components (PCs) of shape space
and visualizes actual pelvic morphologies at six developmental
stages from birth to late adulthood. Fig. 2 graphs the temporal
course of pelvic size and shape change. Pelvic growth trajectories
(i.e., age-related increase in size) of females and males are
largely similar (Fig. 2A). PC1, which accounts for 45% of the
total shape variation in the sample, captures a shared male/female
mode of shape change (Fig. 2B). It is closely correlated with
increase in size (females: r2 = 0.91; males: r2 = 0.92) and thus
represents ontogenetic allometry (i.e., growth-related change
in shape). PC2 (accounting for 11% of the total shape varia-
tion) and PC3 (accounting for 10%) track the development of
sex-specific differences in pelvic shape. Female and male tra-
jectories diverge early during infancy (see PC3 in Figs. 1B and
2D) and exhibit further separation during late childhood (see
PC2 in Figs. 1A and 2C), resulting in moderate but significant
sexual dimorphism at the onset of puberty (age 10–12 y) (Fig.
2E and Table S1). These findings confirm previous studies on

 the early development of sexual dimorphism in pelvic sub-
structures (7, 35–37).
From the age of ∼10 y onward the female trajectory changes
its direction substantially, whereas the male trajectory continues
its earlier course (Figs. 1B and 2D and Table S2). Around the
age of 40–45 y, the female trajectory changes again, assuming a
direction that is largely parallel to that of the male trajectory
(Figs. 1B and 2D and Table S2). Overall, the mean difference
between male and female pelvic shapes (i.e., pelvic sexual di-
morphism) reaches a peak during early adulthood and is re-
duced during later adult life (Fig. 2E), as has been observed
earlier (38).
Fig. 3 visualizes the corresponding modes of sex-specific change
in pelvic shape (for additional visualizations and animations, see
Fig. S1 and Movies S1–S6). In males, pelvic development from
∼15 y to young adulthood (∼25 y) is characterized by a relative
reduction of anteroposterior and superoinferior dimensions
(Fig. 3A and Movies S1–S3). During this process the superior
portion of the sacrum is tilted ventrally, and the greater sciatic
notch becomes narrower.
Development of the female pelvis during the same period
(∼15 to ∼25 y) (Fig. 3A and Movies S1–S3) differs substantially
from the male mode (Table S2). The sacrum and the ischiopubic
region undergo substantial eversion, and the iliac blades undergo
inversion. As a result, the anteroposterior dimensions of the pelvic
midplane and outlet and the transverse dimensions of the pelvic
inlet and outlet become larger (Figs. 3A and 4). Also, the subpubic
angle (Fig. 4A) and the angle formed by the greater sciatic notch
become wider. As an additional effect, the biacetabular distance
becomes relatively wider, and bi-iliac width is relatively reduced
(Fig. 4D). Overall, these developmental changes result in a wide,
obstetrically favorable birth canal.
It should be noted that the contrasting patterns of male and
female pelvic development from puberty to young adulthood
visualized here (Fig. 3) were described in part by Coleman (39),
who used anteroposterior radiographs and a precursor of GM
methods to track pelvic development in a longitudinal sample of
the Fels Longitudinal Study begun in 1929. Using the same
sample, a multivariate analysis of linear pelvic dimensions yielded
similar results (7).
Around the age of 40–45 y, the female pelvis resumes a mode
of shape change which is similar to that of males (Figs. 2 and 3B,

 Table S2, and Movies S4–S6). This pattern largely corresponds
to that present in ∼15- to 25-y-old males (Table S2). Ante-
roposterior and superoinferior pelvic dimensions become rela-
tively shorter. Interspinous distance is reduced, and the iliac
blades become more everted. At the same time, the subpubic
angle and the greater sciatic notch become narrower, as observed
earlier (38, 40). In females, this mode of shape change results in a
significant reduction of obstetrically relevant birth canal dimen-
sions (Fig. 4).
Although our data show that female and male trajectories
diverge substantially before the attainment of sexual maturity, we
further assessed whether maternity (pregnancy and lactation) has
an influence on the development of pelvic shape, as reported, for
example, in mice (41). To this end, we analyzed pelvic shape
variation in a subsample of females with known maternity status.
Results show that pelvic morphologies of parous and nonparous
females (both groups with an average age of 34 y) are statistically
indistinguishable (Figs. 1, 2, and 4 and Table S3).
Discussion
The findings presented here provide support for the DOD hy-
pothesis along several lines of evidence: With the onset of pu-
berty, the female developmental trajectory diverges substantially
from the childhood trajectory, whereas the male trajectory es-
sentially continues its earlier course (Table S2). As a result, the
female pelvis attains its obstetrically most favorable morphology
around the age of 25–30 y, i.e., at the age of highest fertility (33,
34). Furthermore, pelves in postmenopausal women assume a
developmental mode that is largely similar to that of males (Table
S2), with the effect that the birth canal becomes constricted.
Sexual dimorphism is largely the outcome of the sex-biased
expression of autosomal genes, which in turn are regulated by
sex-specific hormone levels and/or differential hormone receptor
sensitivity (26, 27, 42). In mice, for example, testicular-feminized
males (i.e., males lacking androgen receptors) and gonadecto-
mized males develop female-like pelvic morphologies, whereas
experimental administration of androgens to females induces
male-like morphologies (28–30). In humans, direct evidence for
hormone-mediated sex-specific bone remodeling patterns of the
pelvis is not yet available. Nevertheless, studies on long bone
morphology indicate that sexual skeletal dimorphism develops
via complex interactions between sex-specific steroid hormone
levels, sex-biased gene expression, and gender differences in sen-
sitivity to bone-loading conditions and to hormones such as the
growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) axis (42–45).
Our data on pelvic development thus may be tentatively linked
to hormonal change in the following way: The early differentia-
tion of sex-specific pelvic shape might be related to the transient
hormonal “minipuberty” during the first year of life (46). Di-
rectional changes in developmental trajectories during the pre-
pubertal stage (see PC2 in Figs. 1 and 2) may be linked to the
increase in IGF1 (47). The substantial divergence of the female
developmental trajectory during puberty (see PC3 in Figs. 1 and
2) is most likely caused by the sex-specific rise in estradiol levels,
triggering a change in pelvic bone-remodeling patterns (46, 47).
We further hypothesize that the obstetrically favorable shape of
the female pelvis is maintained by the high estradiol levels during
the time of maximum fertility and that the significant reduction of
obstetric dimensions from age 40 y onwards is related to the
premenopausal decline in estradiol levels (46). Further testing of
these hypotheses will require combined hormonal, morphometric,
and life-history data.
Short-term hormonal effects of pregnancy and birthing on sa-
croiliac and pubic joint motility, as well as the effects of body po-
sition on pelvic obstetric dimensions, are well documented (48–50).
However, the age-matched sample of parous and nonparous indi-
viduals studied here does not provide evidence for major effects of
pregnancy and lactation on the development of female-specific
pelvic morphology. The weak or absent influence of the growing
fetus on its mother’s pelvic development thus might be one of the
reasons for fetopelvic disproportion and obstructed labor.
What are the possible evolutionary implications of hormone-
mediated development of pelvic obstetric dimensions? Our data
suggest that estrogens have a strong influence on the develop-
ment of the female pelvic morphology during puberty. At the
same time, they imply a weak-to-absent influence of androgens
on human male-specific pelvic development during puberty, al-
though such influences are well documented in other de-
velopmental modules such as the face (51–53). As proposed

 earlier (4), testosterone may be involved in the maintenance of
the human male pelvic morphology throughout development but
does not lead to developmental divergence during puberty.
Referring to recent hypotheses on ecological and nutritional
factors influencing the OD (23), we postulate that the female
pelvis is highly sensitive to in vivo modification via environmental
modulation of hormone levels. As proposed in the framework of
human reproductive ecology (23), and specifically by the pre-
dictive adaptive response hypothesis (54), an individual’s develop-
mental trajectory may be modified according to the environmental
conditions “expected” (i.e., likely) during its reproductive phase.
The relationship between the term fetus and its mother’s pelvic
morphology thus might be mediated via estrogen levels, which in
turn are sensitive to the current state of ecological parameters
relevant for prenatal and postnatal development.
Based on the evidence presented here, the DOD hypothesis
predicts that higher levels of estrogen in females during puberty/
young adulthood result in development/maintenance of an ob-
stetrically more favorable pelvic morphology, which facilitates
the delivery of larger babies. The relationships between sex
hormone levels, maternal pelvic morphology, fetal size, and pre/
postnatal development are complex and are topics of intense
research (10, 11, 23, 55, 56). For example, it has been shown that
females who are large at birth have comparatively high estradiol
levels during adulthood (57). Estradiol levels also are influenced
by diet and nutritional status (58–60) and are good predictors of
fertility (61), and, likely, of adult pelvic shape (this study). Given
this network of cause and effect, there is ample opportunity for
in vivo feedback between ecological/nutritional conditions, sex
hormone levels, neonate size, and maternal body and pelvic di-
mensions. For instance, the observed within-subject correlation
of pelvic obstetric dimensions with body size and head size (25)
could partly be an effect of higher estradiol levels in larger fe-
males (57), resulting in obstetrically more favorable morphol-
ogies of their pelves.
Evidence for estradiol-mediated female-specific patterns of
pelvic development in humans (this study), nonhuman primates
(4), and rodents (32) may indicate either evolutionarily con-
served or convergent developmental mechanisms of sexual di-
morphism in mammalian species exhibiting obstetric constraints.
Because pelvic width does not correlate with locomotor effi-
ciency (13), the question remains why the female pelvis did not
evolve and/or does not develop wider obstetric dimensions,
which would significantly reduce the existing perinatal risks for
the mother and the infant. Pelvic size might be limited by nu-
tritional conditions, which impose global constraints on body
growth (11). The high prevalence of obstructed labor thus might
largely represent a modern phenomenon resulting from a mis-
match between secular increases in neonate size and maternal
size. However, additional factors must be advanced to explain
both the limited expansion of female pelvic dimensions during
pubertal development and the reversal to more constricted di-
mensions during postmenopausal development. One conspicu-
ous feature of the female expansion/reversal pattern is the
widening/shortening of the distance between the ischial spines
(Figs. 3 and 4C). The ischial spines are larger in humans than in
nonhuman primates, because they constitute important attach-
ment sites for the ligaments and fasciae forming the pelvic floor
(62). The spines and associated ligamentous structures sub-
stantially constrain the birth canal dimensions, but they provide
support for the abdominal and pelvic organs and contribute to
sagittal stabilization of the sacrum (62–64). Intraabdominal hy-
drostatic pressure reaches high peak values during walking and
running (65), and although that pressure positively influences the
stability of the lumbar spine, it results in high strains in the pelvic
floor (66). Pelvic floor strains thus might represent a limiting
factor of birth canal dimensions, and this hypothesis receives
support from the observation that wider dimensions correlate
with a higher prevalence of pelvic floor disorders (67).
Based on these considerations, we hypothesize that the evo-
lutionary and developmental dilemma of the female pelvis reflects
a trade-off between obstetrics and abdominopelvic stability.
During a female’s lifetime, the dilemma is alleviated first in one
direction, by widening the birth canal during the time of highest
fertility, and then in the other, by restricting its dimensions during
postmenopausal life. Although our data provide support for the
obstetric side of the dilemma, testing its locomotor side will re-
quire a shift of focus from bipedal locomotor economy toward
locomotion-related abdominopelvic stability. It remains to be
clarified whether the female postmenopausal reversal to more
constricted birth canal dimensions evolved under selective pres-
sures acting on postreproductive life (68) or whether it represents
a proximate effect of reduced estrogen levels and developmental
plasticity. Also, when during human evolution the developmental
mode of the female pelvis started to diverge from the male mode
remains to be investigated.
Materials and Methods
The study is based on an anonymized known-age and known-sex forensic/
clinical sample of nonsymptomatic humans (n = 275) ranging from late fetal
stages to late adulthood (Table S4). Data sources are the Collections of the
Anthropological Institute, the Virtopsy database of the Institute of Forensic
Medicine of the University of Zurich, Children’s Hospital of Zurich, the In-
stitute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology of the University of Zurich,
the digital autopsy database of the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium
(KU Leuven), and clinical datasets freely available from the OsiriX web-page
(www.osirix-viewer.com).
Volumetric data were acquired with medical CT (beam collimation 128 ×
0.6 mm; in-plane pixel size 0.2 × 0.2–0.7 × 0.7 mm2, slice increment 0.2–1.0 mm).
3D surface models of the bony pelvis were generated with Avizo 6.3.1
(FEI Visualization Sciences Group), and subsequent mesh cleaning was per-
formed with Geomagic XOS (3D Systems). Only well-preserved pelves were
used. Several specimens (n = 9 with ages <8 y, n = 5 with ages 12–15 y, and
n = 14 with ages 50–80 y) required minor virtual reconstruction (69, 70).
The shape of the pelvis was quantified with a total number of k = 377 3D
anatomical landmarks, which denote locations of biological and/or geo-
metric homology among specimens of the sample. These comprise fixed
landmarks (LMs) (kf = 63), curve semi-landmarks (SLMs) (kc = 90), and surface
SLMs (ks = 224) (Fig. S2 and Tables S5 and S6). The fixed-LM set comprises 14
LM pairs, which eventually fuse during pelvic development. For geometric
morphometric analyses, the mean position was calculated for each pair,
resulting in kf = 49 fixed LMs and a total of k = 363 LMs. Surface SLMs were
generated from an arbitrary specimen’s point cloud, and iterative SLM
sliding procedures were applied as described in ref. 71. SLM sliding was
performed relative to the symmetrized mean configuration, using the min-
imum bending energy criterion. These data were submitted to generalized
Procrustes analysis. All procedures were performed with the R package
Morpho, version 2.3.1.1 (72).
Principal component analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of
shape space and visualize major patterns of shape variation in the sample.
Sex-specific moving averages of PC scores, centroid size, and angular and
linear pelvic dimensions were calculated to explore patterns of morphological
change along developmental trajectories. To test for differences between
group-specific pelvic shapes (Tables S1 and S3), Procrustes ANOVA was
performed using the R package geomorph, version 3.0.0-1 (73). Directions of
developmental trajectories through shape space were compared using the
methods proposed in ref. 74 (Table S2).
