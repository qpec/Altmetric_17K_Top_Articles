ZP2 peptide beads select human sperm in vitro,
decoy mouse sperm in vivo, and provide
reversible contraception
Matteo A. Avella,1 Boris A. Baibakov,1 Maria Jimenez-Movilla,2 Anna Burkart Sadusky,1 Jurrien Dean1*
Gamete recognition in the female reproductive tract occurs at the surface of the zona pellucida surrounding ovu-
lated eggs. The acellular zona matrix is composed of three (mouse) or four (human) proteins (ZP1 to ZP4), and the
amino terminus of ZP2 is the primary sperm-binding ligand. Mouse and human sperm bind, respectively, to recom-
binant moZP235–149 and huZP239–154 peptides attached to agarose beads. Mouse ZP2 peptide beads markedly
inhibited fertilization of ovulated mouse eggs inseminated in vitro and incubated overnight. Similarly, human
ZP2 peptide beads prevented sperm binding and penetration of transgenic ZP2Rescue zonae pellucidae, in which
human ZP2 replaced mouse ZP2. When mouse ZP2 peptide beads were transcervically deposited into the uterus,
there was no change in mating behavior and copulatory plugs were present, but bound sperm did not progress
into the oviduct and female mice were infertile. On average, contraception lasted >10 estrus cycles but was revers-
ible with no detectable pathology in the reproductive tract. Despite the long-term contraceptive effect, initial sperm
binding to the peptide beads was reversible in vitro. We exploited this observation to select human sperm that
were better able to penetrate the zonae of human ZP2Rescue eggs, and the approach holds promise for identifying
superior sperm for human assisted reproductive technologies (ART). We conclude that the amino-terminal ZP2 pep-
tide supports sperm binding, which is initially reversible but, with time, becomes irreversible. Short-term, reversible
binding may be useful in selecting sperm for ART, and long-term binding decoys sperm and results in effective
contraception in mice.
INTRODUCTION
Improved reproductive choice requires more robust options for con-
traception as well as enhanced assisted reproductive technologies (ART)
for treatment of infertility. The current world population (7.2 billion)
is expected to increase to 9.6 billion to 12.3 billion by 2100 (1), giving
immediacy to the discovery of innovative and effective contraceptive
strategies. Conversely, improved gamete selection would materially
benefit successful outcomes for ART in the treatment of infertility that
affects roughly one in eight couples (2). A compelling target for non-
hormonal modulation of fertility is the zona pellucida, an extracellular
matrix surrounding ovulated eggs and the preimplantation embryo.
The zona pellucida is composed of three (mouse) or four (human)
homologous glycoproteins designated as ZP1 to ZP4 (3, 4).
Successful mammalian fertilization requires sperm binding to ZP2.
Human sperm do not bind to the mouse zona pellucida (5) but will
bind and penetrate genetically engineered mouse zona pellucida, in which
human ZP2 replaces the endogenous mouse protein (huZP2Rescue mice).
The penetrating human sperm do not bind or fuse with mouse eggs
but accumulate in the perivitelline space between the zona matrix and
the plasma membrane (6). After fertilization, egg cortical granules release
ovastacin (7), a zinc metalloendoprotease that cleaves the N terminus
of ZP2 to prevent gamete recognition and polyspermy (8, 9). Recent
progress in understanding the molecular basis of gamete recognition
has documented that the N terminus of ZP2 is necessary and suffi-
cient for human and mouse sperm binding and essential for female
mouse fertility. Recombinant mouse and human ZP2 N-terminal
peptides (moZP235–149 or huZP239–154) produced in baculovirus and
attached to agarose beads can support in vitro binding of their cognate
sperm (10).
Our current studies investigate the ability of the N terminus of ZP2
to (i) select human sperm better able to bind and penetrate the zona
pellucida and (ii) decoy sperm in the female reproductive tract for
reversible contraception. Existing selection criteria for sperm used in
ART are based on Kruger’s strict morphology (11), sperm motility,
and the ability of sperm to bind hyaluronic acid and penetrate through
the cumulus oophorus or bind in a hemizona assay. However, none
seem ideal (12). We now report that human sperm isolated by ZP2
peptide beads show enhanced ability to bind and penetrate zonae
pellucidae surrounding ovulated huZP2Rescue eggs. In addition, we doc-
ument the ability of N-terminal ZP2 peptides attached to agarose beads
to decoy mouse sperm and prevent fertilization in vitro. After in-
trauterine administration, sperm bound to the ZP2 peptide beads and
did not progress into the oviduct to encounter ovulated eggs, which
provided long-term, reversible contraception in vivo.
RESULTS
AcrmCherry sperm bind to ZP2 peptide beads
A transgene (Fig. 1A) in which complementary DNA (cDNA) encod-
ing mCherry replaced enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in
AcrEGFP (13) was used to establish mouse lines (fig. S1A). Under the
control of the acrosin promoter, these mice expressed fluorescent mCherry
that accumulated in the acrosomes overlying the anteriorly located sperm
nucleus and was detected before, but not after, induction of acrosome
exocytosis (Fig. 1B). The AcrmCherry transgenic mice were fertile with
normal litter sizes. Their sperm had normal morphology and motility

 as determined by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA-IVOS)
(fig. S1B).
To test whether sperm, immediately after release from the epididymis,
have the ability to bind the zona pellucida or the N terminus of ZP2,
we isolated AcrmCherry and AcrEGFP (13) sperm from epididymides into
the human tubal fluid (HTF) medium supplemented with bovine serum
albumin (BSA) and used immediately or after a 1-hour incubation at
37°C, respectively. After either treatment, fluorescently tagged sperm
bound within 5 min to the zona pellucida surrounding cumulus-free
eggs either alone or as a 1:1 mixture (Fig. 1C and fig. S1C). Mouse
sperm also bound to moZP235–149 peptide beads (Fig. 1, D and E,
and fig. S1D), but not to beads alone (fig. S1E), and previous incuba-
tion (1 hour) in HTF/BSA medium did
not affect the number of sperm that ini-
tially bound (Fig. 1F). We conclude that
mouse and human sperm incubated for
as little as 5 min in HTF/BSA can bind
to the N terminus of ZP2 in numbers
comparable to those observed at 1 hour.
This is consistent with reports that sperm
bind in vitro to the zona pellucida sur-
rounding eggs before capacitation (14),
which is required for acrosome exocyto-
sis and fertilization (15, 16).
MoZP235–149 peptide beads inhibit
in vitro fertilization
To determine whether moZP235–149 could
decoy sperm, we inseminated eggs in cu-
mulus mass in vitro with 1 × 105 sperm
in 500 ml of medium in the presence of
moZP235–149 peptide beads (3000 beads/ml)
or agarose beads (3000 beads/ml) lacking
zona peptides (Fig. 2A). In the absence of
beads or in the presence of beads alone,
84.5 ± 1.6% [average (avg) ± SEM] and
75.8 ± 1.6% of eggs were fertilized, re-
spectively. However, in the presence of
moZP235–149 peptide beads, only 6.8 ± 3.8%
of the eggs were fertilized after a 24-hour
incubation (Fig. 2B).
MoZP235–149 peptides incubated for
1 hour with live epididymal sperm bound
to the anterior surface and postacrosomal
region of acrosome-intact sperm and trans-
located to the equatorial segment after sponta-
neous acrosome exocytosis (Fig. 2C). Under
identical experimental conditions, reduced
and alkylated moZP2 peptides lacking sec-
ondary structure did not bind at all to
acrosome-intact or acrosome-reacted sperm
(fig. S2, A and B). To study the effect of
sperm–peptide bead interactions in vitro,
we added 10 ml of moZP235–149 peptide
beads (300 beads/ml) to 1 × 105 progres-
sive motile AcrmCherry sperm immediately
after or 1 hour after release from the ep-
ididymis in 500 ml of HTF/BSA. At 5 min
to 8 hours after insemination, we determined the number, motility,
and acrosome status of bound sperm, as well as the motility of the
free sperm in the medium. Sperm freshly released from the epididymis
or incubated in medium for 1 hour before insemination bound to the
peptide beads in comparable numbers (fig. S2, C and D). Unbound
sperm in the medium maintained progressive motility for 2 hours af-
ter insemination but completely lost their motility by 4 hours (Fig.
2D), at which time the beads to which sperm were bound no longer
rotated (fig. S2E).
Both freshly released sperm from the epididymis and sperm that
were incubated for 1 hour in medium before insemination, which then
bound to the ZP2 peptide beads, underwent acrosome exocytosis

Downloaded from 
 between 60 min and 4 hours after insemination (Fig. 2E), but acrosome-
reacted, nonmotile sperm remained bound to the peptide bead as de-
termined by light (fig. S2, C and D) and electron microscopy (Fig. 2F),
presumably via the equatorial region to which the moZP235–149 pep-
tide remained bound (Fig. 2C, right panel). We conclude that over
time, sperm decoyed by the moZP2 peptide beads lose motility, lose
membrane integrity, and are unable to fertilize eggs.
HuZP239–154 peptide beads
inhibit zona matrix penetration by
human sperm
To extend these observations to human
biology, we documented that human sperm,
either freshly thawed or incubated in HTF/
BSA for 2 hours before insemination,
bound to huZP239–154 peptide beads (Fig.
1, D and F, and fig. S3, A and B). Sperm
binding and zona penetration were as-
sayed using huZP2Rescue eggs from trans-
genic mice, in which huZP2 replaced
endogenous moZP2 (6). HuZP2Rescue eggs
in cumulus and 1 × 105 progressive mo-
tile human sperm were incubated over-
night in medium (500 ml), beads alone
(3000 beads/ml), or huZP239–154 peptide
beads (3000 beads/ml) (Fig. 3A). Progres-
sive motility of unbound sperm was main-
tained for at least 2 hours (Fig. 3B). In
the presence of medium, beads alone, or
moZP235–149 peptide beads, one to five
human sperm were observed in the peri-
vitelline space of these eggs. However, in
the presence of huZP239–154 peptide beads,
no sperm were present in the perivitelline
space of 27 huZP2Rescue eggs, and a single
human sperm was observed in the 28th egg
(Fig. 3C). We conclude that moZP235–149
and huZP239–154 peptide beads are effective
in decoying mouse and human sperm, re-
spectively, and preventing them from bind-
ing and penetrating the zona pellucida
surrounding ovulated eggs in cumulus, even
when the number of sperm is substantially
greater than encountered in vivo (17).
HuZP239–154 peptide beads select
sperm competent for binding and
penetration of the zona pellucida
In the peptide bead–binding experiments,
we observed that 30 min after insemina-
tion, human sperm bound to the beads
were loose and easily detached by gentle
pipetting. To determine whether the ini-
tially bound sperm have a superior ability
to penetrate the zona matrix, we incu-
bated 1 × 105 progressive motile human
sperm in 500 ml of medium with beads
alone (300 beads/ml) or huZP2 peptide
beads (300 beads/ml) for 30 min and
transferred to a second dish where sperm and beads were separated
by gentle pipetting (fig. S3C). Beads were then removed under micro-
scopic visualization. The remaining sperm, selected for their ability to
reversibly bind to the huZP2 peptide beads, were fixed and immu-
nostained with antibodies to sperm equatorial segment protein
1 (SPESP1) and CD46 (6) to determine whether the acrosome was
intact or reacted, respectively. Under these experimental conditions,

 62.6 ± 10.4% (avg ± SEM) of the human sperm were acrosome-intact
compared to the starting population in which 53.2 ± 5.2% sperm were
acrosome-intact.
To investigate the biological activity of the selected sperm from in-
dividual donors, we added 5 to 10 huZP2Rescue eggs in cumulus mass
after the removal of the beads under microscopic visualization (fig.
S3C). Using sperm (~103 ml−1) from five anonymous, fertile human
donors, the number of sperm that bound to the surface of the zona
pellucida (Fig. 4, A to C, and fig. S4, A and B) or penetrated through
the zona matrix (Fig. 4, D to F, and fig. S4, C and D) was substantially
increased after selection with huZP2 peptide beads compared to un-
selected sperm incubated with medium or beads alone. The five do-
nors differed in the number of sperm bound to the zona pellucida
[donor A, 2.0 ± 0.5 (avg ± SEM); donor B, 8.6 ± 2.2; donor C, 4.8 ±
0.6; donor D, 4.2 ± 0.9; donor E, 4.3 ± 0.7) and in the number of sperm
in the perivitelline space (donor A, 2.0 ± 0.5; donor B, 2.2 ± 0.7; donor
C, 6.1 ± 1.1; donor D, 3.7 ± 0.7; donor E, 2.7 ± 0.4) (fig. S4).
To document that the selected human sperm could bind to native
human zonae pellucidae, we removed the beads and added four to
seven immature human zonae pellucidae (Fig. 4G). After 1 hour of
incubation, human sperm bound robustly to the native zona matrix
and were quantified after fixation and confocal microscopy (avg ±
SEM; donor A, 55.2 ± 7.8 sperm per zona; donor B, 43.5 ± 4.4 sperm
per zona; donor C, 105.6 ± 15.0 sperm per zona), with results that were
comparable to earlier reports (18, 19). From these observations, we con-
clude that human sperm selection with huZP2 peptide beads is a rapid
(35 min) and effective procedure to identify subpopulations of sperm
competent for zona pellucida binding and penetration. These results sug-
gest utility in the clinic to improve the outcome of ART for humans.
MoZP235–149 peptide beads act to decoy sperm in vivo
To determine whether the same sperm decoy effect observed in vitro
could be achieved in vivo, we transcervically administered moZP235–149
peptide beads or beads alone (1.5 × 106) (Fig. 5A) into the bilateral
uterine horns of mice using a 1-ml syringe attached to a blunted plas-
tic needle (10). To assay the effectiveness of this procedure, we con-
firmed the presence of moZP235–149 peptide on the moZP2 peptide
beads in vitro with a monoclonal antibody to ZP2N-term (Fig. 5B). Af-
ter intrauterine administration, the reproductive tract was fixed and
clarified for 3 weeks with ScaleA2 (20), and ZP2 peptide beads were
detected throughout the uterus by confocal microscopy. No immuno-
reactivity with the anti-ZP2 antibody was observed after administra-
tion of beads alone, which were identified by staining with wheat germ
agglutinin (Fig. 5C).
We hypothesized that precocious interaction between sperm and
moZP2 peptide beads would impede sperm progression after intra-
uterine ejaculation and cause infertility. To follow sperm migration
and acrosome status, we crossed AcrmCherry mice with Prm1EGFP (21)
and FiglaEGFP (22) mice to establish AcrmCherry; Prm1EGFP; FiglaEGFP
mice in which protamineEGFP was present in the nucleus, myristoylated
EGFP was embedded in the plasma membrane, and mCherry was pres-
ent in the acrosome. These mice were fertile with normal litter sizes, and
their sperm had normal morphology, albeit with a decrease in the number
of sperm with progressive motility as determined by CASA-IVOS
(Fig. 5D and fig. S1B).
Eggs in cumulus oophorus from Zp3EGFP female mice with a green
zona pellucida (23) were inseminated in vitro with AcrmCherry; Prm1EGFP;
FiglaEGFP sperm. After 5 min, sperm and eggs were fixed and clarified
and then imaged by confocal microscopy, where both acrosome-intact
(yellow heads) and acrosome-reacted sperm (green heads) could be
observed at single-cell resolution (Fig. 5E). These fixation and clarifi-
cation procedures were used to determine whether sperm competent
for binding and zona matrix penetration reach the oviductal ampulla
after encountering the moZP2 peptide beads in the uterus. To avoid pos-
sible inconsistencies with in vivo fertilization (time of insemination,

 dissolution of the cumulus oophorus, etc.), we crossed Zp3EGFP mice
into the Cd9 (24) null background to inhibit gamete fusion (and fer-
tilization), which allowed sperm to accumulate in the perivitelline
space. Female mice were treated with HTF medium, beads alone, or
moZP2 peptide beads before overnight mating with AcrmCherry;
Prm1EGFP; FiglaEGFP male mice. Female mice with copulatory plugs were
anesthetized 14 hours after mating and perfused by transcardiac ad-
ministration of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/heparin. After fixation
and clarification of the female reproductive tract, acrosome-reacted and
acrosome-intact sperm bound to moZP2 peptide beads were detected

 MoZP235–149 peptide beads provide long-term reversible
contraception in female mice
The four cysteine residues in moZP235–149 that form two disulfide
bonds were reduced and alkylated (fig. S5B) to confirm the specificity
of the mouse peptide as a sperm decoy. Sperm bound robustly to the
native moZP235–149 peptide beads (26.3 ± 0.2 sperm, avg ± SEM), but
little, if at all (1.3 ± 0.3), after the peptide had been reduced and alkylated
(fig. S5, C and D). Consequently, the reduced and alkylated moZP235–149
peptide beads had little inhibitory effect on in vitro (fig. S5E) or in vivo
(fig. S5F) fertilization, and beads alone were used as negative controls in
subsequent experiments.
Gonadotrophin-stimulated normal female mice were mated with
fertile males after treatment with medium, beads alone, or moZP235–149
peptide beads (~1.5 × 106 beads in 500 ml). Embryos from females with
copulatory plugs were isolated 48 hours after mating. Females (n = 5)
treated with medium or beads alone were fertile, and 21.0 ± 2.1 (avg ±
SEM) and 17.7 ± 1.2 two-cell embryos, respectively, were recovered from
their oviducts 40 hours after mating. Embryos were rarely (1.3 ± 0.3) ob-
served in females (n = 5) treated with moZP2 peptide beads (Fig. 6A).
To investigate an effect on the female mice (n = 5) treated with me-
dium, beads alone, or moZP2 peptide beads, the female mice were co-
caged and continuously mated with a male proven to be fertile (1:3).
Female mice treated with beads alone or medium became pregnant
and delivered pups 25.4 ± 0.6 (avg ± SEM) and 28.2 ± 3.1 days after
mating, respectively. Female mice treated with moZP2 peptide beads
were initially infertile and did not give birth to pups until 72.8 ±
4.6 days after mating. The first moZP2 peptide bead–treated litters
were smaller (3.2 ± 1.2 versus 7.2 ± 1.5) (avg ± SEM) than the beads
alone control, but matched them (8.0 ± 0.7 versus 8.4 ± 1.5) by the
second litter. All of the moZP2 peptide bead–treated mice eventually
resumed fertility and produced at least two litters within the 5-month
study (Fig. 6B), by the end of which no beads were present in the
uterine cavity. To investigate potential pathology as causative of the
observed infertility, we isolated the reproductive tracts of female mice
14 days after treatment. Compared to female mice treated with beads
alone, no histopathology or evidence of inflammation was observed in
female mice treated with moZP2 peptide beads (Fig. 6C). Thus, we
conclude that moZP2 peptide bead treatment results in long-term, re-
versible contraception with no obvious adverse effects.
DISCUSSION
Effective contraception is critical for family planning and includes bar-
rier methods, hormone intervention, intrauterine devices, and steriliza-
tion (27). Newer methods for male contraception reversibly prevent
sperm maturation (28, 29), disrupt the Sertoli cell barrier to promote
sperm loss (30, 31), or affect sperm motility (30). As an alternative ap-
proach, we now provide evidence that decoying sperm in the lower fe-
male reproductive tract with ZP2 N-terminal peptide beads prevents
interactions with ovulated eggs. This strategy provides highly effective,
nonhormonal, long-term, but reversible contraception in female mice.
The N terminus of huZP2 has a compa-
rable effect on human sperm in vitro, and
ZP2 is conserved among eutherian mam-
mals (32). Thus, we envision that the
sperm-decoy strategy can be translated to
theriogenology and reproductive medicine
to provide effective female contraception.
Normally, sperm undergo capacitation
during passage through the female re-
productive tract or after incubation with
serum proteins to gain the ability to fertilize
ovulated eggs (15, 16). Neither mouse nor
human sperm need to be incubated in
HTF/BSA medium longer than 5 min to
bind to the peptide beads, which provide
immediate capture of sperm after initial
contact with the ZP2 N-terminal peptide
both in vitro and in vivo. After 4 (mouse)
to 8 (human) hours, bound sperm lose their
motility as well as the integrity of the plas-
ma and outer acrosome membranes in
vitro and remain adherent to the beads.
Once irreversibly bound to the peptide
beads, sperm do not ascend through the
uterotubal junction and are not observed
in the oviduct. Whether all sperm interact
with the peptide beads or just a sufficient
number to fall below a threshold needed
to progress into the upper female repro-
ductive tract remains to be determined. It
appears that inert beads (37- to 100-mm
diameter) themselves are no obstacle to

 sperm passage through the uterus, because female mice treated with beads
alone had normal in vitro and in vivo fertility. In these proof-of-principle
experiments, the peptide beads provided effective, long-term contraception
that was ultimately reversible. To better provide contraception on demand,
it may be beneficial to combine the ZP2 peptide beads with spermicidal
gels or attach them to removable spermicidal sponges. Alternatively, the
ZP2 peptides could be attached to vaginal rings impregnated with steroid
hormones (estrogen and progestin) to improve contraceptive efficacy by
decreasing available sperm and suppressing ovulation.
Sperm binding to the N terminus of ZP2 in vitro may also provide a
physiological criterion to identify sperm for ART. Intracytoplasmic
sperm injection, in which a single human spermatozoon is injected di-
rectly into a retrieved egg (33), relies on anthropomorphic selection of
one sperm out of many, and successful outcome may not be apparent
until birth or later in life (34). We used huZP2 peptide beads to select
human sperm that have an improved ability to bind and penetrate the
huZP2Rescue zona pellucida and bind robustly to native human zona pel-
lucida. The advantage of sperm selection with huZP2 peptide beads is
multifold. The recombinant human peptide provides an inexhaustible
supply of reagents, and commercial production of the peptide beads is
technologically simple. The selection procedure takes ~30 min and can
be supplementedbysecondary criteriasuchasspermmorphology and/or
motility. It may be useful to concentrate sperm in patients with oligo-
zoospermia (<20 million sperm ml−1), select better performing sperm
from patients with asthenozoospermia (<50% normal motility or <25%
any motility), and discriminate between normal and abnormal sperm in
patients with teratozoospermia (<30% normal morphology).
Although the findings are promising, further validation of these ob-
servations is required. Double-blind clinical trials will be needed to de-
termine the relative merit of choosing sperm with huZP2 peptide beads
compared to existing selection procedures. It remains to be seen whether
selected sperm will result in better outcomes for in vitro fertilization or
intracytoplasmic sperm injections, and it is not yet clear how that will be
determined and whether it will be consistent across mammalian species.
Despite its effectiveness in a rodent model, the ability of ZP2 peptide
beadstodecoysperminthefemalereproductivetractneedstobeassessed
in more translationally relevant mammals. Similarly, agarose beads may
not be the optimal substrate to tether the ZP2 peptides for delivery into
the female reproductive tract, and alternatives will need to be explored. In
addition, the long-termeffectsof repeatedadministration of ZP2 peptides
are unknown and remain a concern given the association of autoimmune
oophoritis with zona pellucida–based contraceptive vaccines (35).
Last, we used perfusion and clarification strategies developed for
brain tissue (20) to image fluorescently tagged sperm (AcrmCherry; Prm1EGFP;
FiglaEGFP) and determine their localization and acrosome status with
single-cell resolution. Coupled with the use of fluorescently tagged
eggs (for example, Zp3EGFP), these approaches may be proven useful
for investigations in oocyte maturation within the ovary, the acrosome
status of sperm as they traverse the female reproductive tract, fertiliza-
tion within the cumulus oophorus in the ampulla of the oviduct, and
embryonic progression during preimplantation development.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
These investigations are based on the recent observation in transgenic
mice that sperm bind to the N terminus of ZP2 in the extracellular
zona pellucida surrounding mouse and human eggs. The objectives
of the current studies were twofold. The first objective was to deter-
mine whether mouse N-terminal ZP2 peptides attached to agarose
beads could act as a decoy to bind mouse sperm and prevent in vitro
fertilization. These studies were then extended by transcervical admin-
istration of control beads and peptide beads, which resulted in long-
term, reversible contraception in vivo. The second objective was to
translate these observations from mouse to human by using huZP2
peptide beads to prevent human sperm from penetrating zonae pellu-
cidae, in which huZP2 replaces moZP2. The success of this approach
prompted further investigations into using the huZP2 peptide beads to
select superior sperm for ART, as judged by their ability to bind and
penetrate huZP2 rescue zonae pellucidae better than unselected sperm.
The results were confirmed by using multiple, randomly selected,
anonymous, fertile sperm donors to minimize bias. These studies also
introduced the use of ScaleA2 to clarify the female reproductive tract
and facilitate observations of fluorescently tagged sperm and eggs in
fixed tissues.
Establishment of mouse lines with fluorescent sperm
DNA encoding EGFP was released from Acr3EGFP (13) in pUC19 by
digestion with Pst I (New England Biolabs) and treated with Klenow
(Promega) to generate blunt ends. We used mCherry (Takara Clontech)
as a template to synthesize mCherry + SV40 poly(A) cDNA by poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) with oligonucleotides flanking the Eco RV
restriction sites (forward, 5′-GATATCACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGC-3′;
reverse, 5′-GATATCCACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGC-3′). The PCR
product was subcloned into pCR2.1, isolated after digestion with
Eco RV, and blunt end–ligated into pUC19-Acr3 to establish a
transgene with an acrosin promoter (2.4 kb), the proacrosin signal
peptide (MVEMLPTVAVLVLAVSVVA) including an N-terminal
peptide (KDNTT) in-frame with the mCherry cassette, analogous to
Acr3EGFP.
The transgene was isolated with Bam HI and Hind III (New England
Biolabs), gel-purified, and injected into the male pronucleus of ferti-
lized FVB/N eggs. Mice were genotyped by PCR (95°C for 30 s, 58°C
for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min ×30 cycles, 72°C for 7 min, and 4°C for >30 min)
using mouse tail DNA and primers that amplified a 507–base pair
region across the 5′ untranslated region of Acrosin and mCherry (for-
ward, 5′-TTTGTGAGGTCACAGCTTGC-3′; reverse, 5′-GTAGAT-
GAACTCGCCGTCCT-3′). Expression of the AcrmCherry transgene
was detected by reverse transcription PCR with a gene-specific primer
set (table S1) and total RNA isolated from a 12-week-old male mouse
tissue (fig. S1A). Gapdh transcripts served as a control for RNA integ-
rity (table S1) (10).
Three founder males passed the transgene through their germ line
and accumulated mCherry in their acrosomes. One line, Tg(Acr/
mCherry1Dean), was used in the experiments reported and desig-
nated as AcrmCherry. This line was crossed with the Prm1EGFP (21)
and the FiglaEGFP (with myristoylated EGFP embedded in the plasma
membrane) (22) lines to obtain a mouse line with sperm that accumu-
lates mCherry in the acrosome and EGFP in the sperm nucleus and in
the plasma membrane (AcrmCherry; Prm1EGFP; FiglaEGFP).
All mice were handled in compliance with the guidelines of the
Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institutes of Health
under the Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Dia-
betes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), which approved
the animal study protocols.

 Preparation of mouse and human gametes
Normal or transgenic mouse sperm were released from cauda epidi-
dymides in HTF (EMD Millipore) supplemented with 0.4% BSA
(Sigma-Aldrich) and analyzed by CASA-IVOS (10). Mouse sperm
were incubated for 1 hour (37°C, 90% N2, 5% O2, 5% CO2) to ensure
capacitation before use. Control (ICR) or Zp3EGFP (23) female mice
were stimulated with 5 IU of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG)
and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (Sigma-Aldrich), and eggs
in cumulus were collected 12 hours after hCG injection and incubated
as described above in 500 ml of HTF with 0.4% BSA at a final concen-
tration of 1 × 105 ml−1 progressive motile sperm (9, 10). Fertilization
was scored 24 hours later by the presence of two-cell embryos. To assess
in vivo fertility, males (≥5) from each mouse line were singly co-caged
with control fertile female mice, and litters were recorded until females
gave birth to at least two litters.
To isolate human sperm, human semen (Genetics & IVF Institute
Cryobank) was added to an Eppendorf tube (2.0 ml) containing 0.5 ml
of 40% of PureSperm (Nidacon) layered over 0.5 ml of 80% PureSperm
(http://nidacon.com/ifu/density_gradient.pdf). After centrifugation
(swinging bucket, 20 min × 300g) and removal of the supernatant,
the sperm pellet was resuspended in the residual buffer and
transferred into 1.0 ml of HTF. After a second centrifugation (5 min
× 300g), sperm were resuspended in 0.2 ml of HTF/BSA and diluted in
500 ml of HTF with 0.5% BSA to 1 × 105 ml−1 progressive motile
sperm (6, 36). Human sperm were incubated (37°C, 90% N2, 5%
O2, 5% CO2) in HTF/BSA for 4 hours (10).
Light microscopy
Fixed gamete samples (1 hour, 2 to 4% paraformaldehyde) were mounted
in PBS, and images of eggs, embryos, and beads were obtained with an
LSM 780 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss AG) using a 63×/1.2 NA
(numerical aperture) water immersion objective lens at room tempera-
ture (10). Images were exported as full resolution TIF files and pro-
cessed in Photoshop CS6 (Adobe Systems) to adjust brightness and
contrast. Alternatively, confocal optical sections were projected on a
single plane with maximum intensity and combined with DIC images
of sperm, eggs, or peptide beads using LSM image software.
For live imaging of acrosome exocytosis, AcrmCherry sperm were in-
cubated with A23187 (6). To examine sperm peptide bead interac-
tions, moZP235–149 peptide beads (300 beads/ml) were inseminated
with 105 progressive motile AcrmCherry mouse sperm. Z sections were
collected every 15 s by confocal microscopy for 8 hours after insem-
ination using a 20×/0.8 NA objective lens and a 35-mm glass-bottom,
14-mm microwell dish (MatTek) incubated (37°C, 90% N2, 5% O2,
5% CO2) in a Gas Incubation System (ibidi) (10). Projections of con-
focal and DIC images were obtained and analyzed by ZEN and LSM
software. The centers of each bead/circle were tracked at each time
point with individual dots, which were connected with straight lines
to summarize the beads’ translocation over time.
To analyze moZP2 peptide bead binding to sperm, AcrmCherry sperm
were released from the isolated epididymides in 100 ml of 0.4% HTF/
BSA. After a 1-hour incubation (37°C, 5% CO2), sperm (1 × 106 pro-
gressive motile) were added to 2.0 ml of pre-equilibrated moZP235–149
peptide (PBS, 1.5 mg/ml) for an additional hour under the same
conditions. A 2% formaldehyde solution (Invitrogen) was used to
cross-link sperm and peptide (30 min, 20°C, end-over-end rotation).
After centrifugation (5 min, 4000g), the sperm were resuspended (1.0 ml
of PBS/BSA), fixed (3.7% formaldehyde, 5 min, 20°C), resuspended in
blocking solution (1.0 ml of PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5% BSA), and in-
cubated (overnight, 4°C) with a monoclonal antibody (1:50) specific
to the N terminus of moZP2 (37, 38). Confocal and DIC images of
acrosome-intact and spontaneously acrosome-reacted sperm were
obtained after incubation with donkey anti-rat immunoglobulin G
(H + L) secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (1:100, Thermo
Fisher), and Hoechst. The acrosome status of human sperm was deter-
mined by immunostaining with antibodies to SPESP1 and CD46 to
detect acrosome-intact and acrosome-reacted sperm, respectively (6).
Electron microscopy
Mouse sperm bound to beads were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M
cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated at 4°C for 2 hours. After
extensive washing in the cacodylate buffer, beads were embedded in
2% agarose. The samples were then dehydrated through a graded series
of ethanol and processed for embedding in LR White resin. Ultrathin
sections were obtained with an ultramicrotome (Microm International
GmbH) and mounted on formvar-coated nickel grids (Electron Micros-
copy Sciences). Ultrathin sections were counterstained with uranyl
acetate followed by lead citrate and imaged in a Jeol JEM-1011 trans-
mission electron microscope (Jeol).
Sperm-egg–binding assays
After treatment with hyaluronidase to remove cumulus cells, eggs
were washed three times in HTF/BSA (9) and incubated with sperm
freshly released from the epididymis (AcrEGFP), sperm incubated for
1 hour in HTF/BSA medium (AcrmCherry), or both types (1:1 ratio)
of progressive motile sperm (final concentration, 1 × 105 ml−1)
suspended in 500 ml of HTF/BSA. After incubation (5 min), eggs were
washed in HTF/BSA by careful transfer to a second and third dish.
Fixed sperm and eggs were mounted in PBS with Hoechst (10 mg/ml)
to identify nuclei. Bound sperm were quantified from Z projections
obtained by confocal microscopy.
Mouse and human sperm binding to ZP2 peptide beads
IMAC Sepharose beads (100 ml; GE Healthcare Life Sciences) were
incubated overnight (37°C, 90% N2, 5% O2, 5% CO2) with recombi-
nant moZP235–149 peptides in 100 ml of HTF/BSA and washed in the
same medium to remove free peptide. The presence of the N terminus
peptide on the agarose beads (37- to 100-mm diameter) was determined
with a monoclonal antibody to the N terminus of ZP2 (6). Beads alone
or moZP2 peptide beads were incubated (37°C, 90% N2, 5% O2, 5%
CO2) with freshly released AcrEGFP (13) or 1 hour–incubated AcrmCherry
mouse sperm in HTF/BSA (500 ml). Samples (20 to 50 beads) were
collected at 5 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 3 hours, 4 hours, and
8 hours, fixed, washed and mounted in PBS with Hoechst. Bound sperm
were quantified from Z projections, and acrosome status was determined
by confocal microscopy. Concomitantly, the concentration and pro-
gressive motility of unbound sperm were evaluated at each time point.
Alternatively, sperm were imaged live for 8 hours (37°C, 90% N2, 5%
O2, 5% CO2) while interacting with moZP2 peptide beads in HTF/
BSA (500 ml) under mineral oil. A 60-mm Z series (5 mm each) was
acquired at 15-s intervals to prevent sperm bleaching/damage.
Recombinant huZP239–154 peptides were attached to IMAC beads
as described for moZP2 peptide. Beads alone or huZP2 peptide beads
(6, 10) were incubated with freshly thawed or 2 hour–incubated human
sperm in HTF/BSA (500 ml). Samples (20 to 50 beads) were collected
over time and analyzed as described for mouse sperm binding.

 Competitive sperm-binding assays
Eggs in cumulus from control (ICR) mice were incubated (37°C, 90%
N2, 5% O2, 5% CO2) with capacitated, progressive motile sperm (1 ×
105 ml−1) in the presence of beads alone or moZP2 peptide beads in
HTF/BSA (500 ml). Sixteen hours later, eggs were collected, and fertil-
ization was scored by the presence of two-cell embryos. Experiments
were performed in triplicate. Alternatively, eggs in cumulus from
huZP2Rescue female mice were incubated (HTF/BSA, 500 ml; 37°C,
90% N2, 5% O2, 5% CO2) with capacitated, progressive motile hu-
man sperm (1 × 105 ml−1) in the presence of beads alone or huZP2
peptide beads. Sixteen hours later, eggs were fixed, stained with WGA-
633 (Thermo Fisher) to visualize the zona pellucida, and mounted in
PBS with Hoechst to quantify by confocal microscopy the number of
supernumerary human sperm in the perivitelline space. Experiments
were performed in triplicate.
Human sperm selection by peptide bead binding
Beads alone or coated with the huZP239–154 peptide were incubated
(30 min, 37°C, 90% N2, 5% O2, 5% CO2) with freshly thawed, progres-
sive motile human sperm (1 × 105 ml−1) in HTF (500 ml). Beads with
sperm loosely attached were carefully transferred to a second dish con-
taining HTF (50 ml). Sperm were released from beads by gentle pipet-
ting and quantified by IVOS. In each sample, beads were removed by
pipette under microscopic visualization, leaving the unbound sperm
behind, and zona-intact immature human oocytes or ovulated eggs in
cumulus from huZP2Rescue female mice were added. As a control, a
comparable number of sperm from the parental dish (before selection)
were incubated (37°C, 90% N2, 5% O2, 5% CO2) with huZP2Rescue eggs
in cumulus. Sixteen hours later, eggs were fixed, stained with WGA-633,
and mounted in PBS with Hoechst (10 mg/ml). The number of sperm
bound to the zona pellucida and present in the perivitelline space was
quantified by Z projections using confocal microscopy. Experiments
were performed using sperm from five different fertile donors.
In vivo ZP2 peptide bead contraception
Gonadotrophin-stimulated female mice were anesthetized with tribro-
moethanol (0.2 mg/10 g body weight). Beads alone, or moZP2 peptide
beads (3 × 105), each diluted in 700 ml of HTF/BSA, were administered
transcervically into both uterine horns using a syringe (1 ml) attached
to a blunt plastic needle. To facilitate injections, anesthetized mice
were positioned by grasping the tip of their tails to expose external
genitalia. Care was taken to advance the needle no more than 1 cm
beyond the cervix to ensure equal delivery into the two uterine horns.
After recovery from the anesthesia, females were mated overnight with
ICR males proven to be fertile. Those with a copulatory plug 24 hours
after mating were euthanized to determine the number of one- and two-
cell embryos within the oviduct. Alternatively, female mice administered
with beads alone or moZP2 peptide beads (five in each experimental
group) were co-caged with a medium (HTF)–treated female and mated
with a male proven to be fertile.
To localize beads in the female reproductive tract, beads alone or
moZP235–149 peptide beads were stained, respectively, with WGA-633
orIE-3(1:50),amonoclonalantibodyspecifictotheNterminusofmoZP2
(37, 38). Stained beads were transferred transcervically, and 1 hour later,
females were anesthetized, perfused by cardiac puncture with PBS (60 ml)
containing heparin (10 U/ml), and sacrificed. After isolation, the female
reproductive tract was fixed overnight in 3% paraformaldehyde, washed
three times in PBS, and clarified in ScaleA2 (20) for 4 weeks.
Ovulated eggs from Cd9Null mice fuse poorly with sperm, resulting
in an accumulation of spermatozoa in the perivitelline space. To doc-
ument interactions of sperm with moZP2 peptide beads in vivo and to
determine whether sperm are able to penetrate the eggs’ zonae pellu-
cidae upon interaction with the ZP2 peptide beads in the uterus,
Zp3EGFP female mice with green zonae pellucidae (23) in a Cd9Null
background (24) were mated overnight with AcrmCherry; Prm1EGFP;
FiglaEGFP male mice. Twenty-four hours after mating, females with
copulatory plugs were anesthetized, perfused, and sacrificed as de-
scribed. Their reproductive tracts were fixed and clarified before im-
aging with an Axioplan2 microscope equipped with an AxioCam ERc
5S camera (Carl Zeiss).
Statistics
All statistical analyses were performed with SigmaStat 12.3 (Systat
Software). The original data are in table S2, and summaries of statis-
tical analyses are in table S3. Descriptive statistics were used for hu-
man and mouse sperm binding, where the numbers of spermatozoa
bound to zonae pellucidae or agarose beads were reported as box plots
reflecting the median (horizontal line) and data points within the 10th
and 90th percentiles (error bars) of three independent experiments.
Boxes included the middle two quartiles, and outliers, when present,
were indicated by dots. Three independent experiments were used to
determine the number of eggs (avg ± SEM) with 0, 1, 2, 3, or >3 sperm
in the perivitelline space for each experimental group. The total num-
ber of eggs analyzed was reported above each graph. The significance
of differences in the avg ± SEM from three independent experiments
evaluating in vitro and in vivo fertilization rates as well as CASA-
IVOS sperm parameters was determined using a one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test for multigroup com-
parison. The Ρ value was considered statistically significant, and the
number of biological replicates for all studies is included in the figure
legends and table S3.
