Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells targeting CD19 mediate potent effects in relapsed/
refractory pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) but antigen loss is a frequent cause of 
resistance to CD19-targeted immunotherapy. CD22 is also expressed on most B-ALL and usually 
retained following CD19 loss. We report results from a phase I trial testing a novel CD22-CAR in 
twenty-one children and adults, including 17 previously treated with CD19-directed 
immunotherapy. Dose dependent anti-leukemic activity was observed with complete remission in 
73% (11/15) of patients receiving ≥ 1 × 106 CD22-CART cells/kg, including 5/5 patients with 
CD19dim/neg B-ALL. Median remission duration was 6 months. Relapses were associated with 
diminished CD22 site density that likely permitted escape from killing by CD22-CART cells. 
These results are the first to eastablish the clinical activity of a CD22-CAR in pre-B cell ALL,

Graphical Abstract
INTRODUCTION
Cure rates for children with B-ALL approach 90%, but outcomes for those with relapsed and 
chemotherapy refractory disease remain poor.1,2 Adults with B-ALL experience survival 
rates <50%, even when treated with pediatric-inspired, risk-adapted, multi-agent regimens.
3–5 Risk-adapting therapy can diminish the prevalence of severe late effects in survivors, but 
long-term morbidity remains substantial, especially in patients treated with intensive 
regimens for high risk-disease.6,7
Immunotherapies targeting CD19 have recently provided a new class of effective 
therapeutics for B-ALL. Blinatumomab, a CD19xCD3 bispecific antibody, mediates 
impressive effects in patients with overt8,9 and minimal residual disease (MRD) levels of B-
ALL10. T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting CD19 have also 
demonstrated impressive antileukemic effects in children and adults with relapsed/refractory 
B-ALL with remission rates ranging from 70–90%.11–13 However, the likelihood of durable 
remission following CD19 targeted immunotherapy remains unknown. Although CD19 is 
expressed on essentially all cases of B-ALL at clinical presentation14,15, relapses with loss 
or diminished surface expression of CD19 are increasingly recognized as a cause of 
treatment failure.12,16–18
Like CD19, CD22 is expressed on most cases of pre-B cell ALL14,19,20, and normal tissue 
expression is restricted to the B cell lineage. Substantial clinical experience and success has 
been reported with monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based therapeutics targeting CD22.21–29 We 
report the first clinical experience using a CD22-CAR in pre-B ALL19,30. Our data 
demonstrate that CD22-CAR expressing T cells have a similar safety profile to CD19-CARs 
and mediate similarly potent anti-leukemic effects, in both immunotherapy-naïve patients 
and patients with CD19 dim/negative relapse following CD19-directed immunotherapy. 
These results are the first to establish that CAR expressing T cells targeting antigens other 
than CD19 can mediate similarly potent antineoplastic effects and the first to demonstrate 
that resistance to immunotherapy via antigen loss can be overcome by treatment with CAR 
T cells targeting an alternative antigen, opening the way to dual targeted 
immunotherapeutics.

 RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The first twenty-one consecutive patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL treated with 
CD22 CAR T cells are included in this analysis. The median age was 19 years (range 7–30 
years), and all patients had undergone at least 1 prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(HSCT) and 2 patients had received 2 prior HSCTs (Supplementary Table 1). Seventeen 
patients had received prior CD19 directed immunotherapy, including 15 who received prior 
CD19-CAR therapy. Lymphoblasts were CD19-negative or dim in 10 patients, including 9 
following CD19-CAR therapy and 1 following blinatumomab. Median marrow blast 
percentage was 70.5% (range 1%-99%) and all were CNS1 (< 5 WBC/mcL and no blasts). 
Median CD22 site density was 2839 molecules per cell (range 613–13452). Fourteen 
patients manifested B-cell aplasia at enrollment (B cell counts < 50 cells/mcL), including 7 
patients who had received prior therapy with a CD19-CAR suggesting ongoing effects of the 
previous CAR therapy please clarify why this is important. You need to provide more 
information for the general reader.Also, please describe in more detail the design of the 
CAR so that readers know from the outset that it is CD22.BB.z. All treated patients received 
the intended protocol-specified cell dose of T cells modified to express the anti-CD22 CAR 
construct which is based on a binding domain previously reported30 and modified to 
incorporate a 41BB endodomain which has been shown to improve persistence.31 A 
schematic of the anti-CD22 CAR construct is shown in Figure 1A. Product characteristics 
are shown in Supplemental Table 2.
Toxicity
The primary toxicity was cytokine release syndrome (CRS)11–13 occurring in 16/21 patients, 
coinciding with CAR T cell expansion, and with onset after day +5 in all patients. Protocol-
defined (supplemental methods) grade 1 CRS occurred in 9 patients and grade 2 CRS 
occurred in 7 patients. Patient #2 experienced grade 3 self-limited, non-infectious, diarrhea 
during CRS which resolved with supportive care, but resulted in a dose limiting toxicity 
(DLT) at the first dose level requiring a protocol-specified expansion of the first dose level to 
6 patients with no further DLTs observed. Three patients received dose level 2 (1×106/kg 
CD22-CAR T cells/kg) with no evidence of DLT. Two patients then proceeded to dose level 
3 (3 × 106/kg CD22-CAR T cells/kg), and patient #10 developed dose limiting grade 4 
hypoxia associated with rapid disease progression requiring brief intubation with complete 
resolution of the hypoxia within 24 hours after initiation of steroids. A second patient was 
safely treated at this dose level without DLT. Based on the single DLT at dose level 3 and 
clinical activity associated with significant CD22-CAR T cell expansion and persistence at 
dose level 2, 1×106/kg CD22-CAR T cells/kg was identified as the recommended phase II 
dose and the cohort was expanded to ten additional patients (n=13 total at dose level 2). One 
subject (patient #14) with a pre-enrollment history of multi-organ failure due to sepsis, died 
from gram negative rod sepsis developing after resolution of CRS and neutrophil count 
recovery to >1000 cells/mcL. Prospective neurotoxicity evaluations demonstrated no 
irreversible neurotoxicity or seizure. Amongst the first 16 patients with complete 
assessments, transient visual hallucinations (n=2), mild unresponsiveness (n=1), mild 
disorientation (n=1) and mild-moderate pain (n=2) were observed but returned to baseline by

 day 28 post-infusion. B-cell aplasia (< 50 cells/mcL) was noted in all patients achieving 
remission, including patients who were not previously B-cell aplastic. Grade 3–4 toxicities 
possibly, probably or definitely attributed to the CD22-CAR are listed in Supplemental Table 
3.
CD22 CARs Demonstrate Robust Expansion and Anti-leukemic Activity
CAR expansion, persistence and response for individual patients are summarized in 
Supplemental Table 4. As shown in Figure 1, CD22-CAR T cells were detected in the 
peripheral blood of 19/21 treated patients, peaking on Day 14. Median peak expansion was 
62% of circulating T cells expressing the CD22-CAR (Figure 1B, range 1–91%), median 
circulating CAR T cell number was 316/mcl (Figure 1C, range 1–3593/mcl), and median 
peak expansion in the first 16 patients, measured by PCR for CAR DNA sequence was 7007 
copies/100ng DNA (Figure 1D, range 15–30,500 copies/100ng DNA). On Day 28, CAR T 
cells remained detectable in the peripheral blood of 15/21 patients, in the bone marrow in 
15/19 patients for whom bone marrow flow was performed (median 25%, range 0–78.2%) 
and in the cerebrospinal fluid in 12/17 patients for whom CSF analysis was performed 
(range 21–71.6%). CAR-T cells remained detectable in the blood of 7 of 9 patients evaluated 
3 months post-infusion, in 2 of 3 patients evaluated at 6 months post-infusion, and in one 
patient each evaluated 9 and 18 months post-infusion who were in ongoing remission at 
these timepoints.
Twelve patients (57%) achieved a complete remission (CR) (Figure 2A); 9 were MRD 
negative (Supplemental Table 4). Response varied with administered cell dose. At the first 
dose level (3×105 CD22-CAR/kg) 1 of 6 patients attained a CR compared to 11 of 15 
patients (73%) at doses ≥ 1 × 106 CD22-CAR/kg (p<0.001, Fisher’s exact test). Among 
patients receiving ≥ 1 × 106 CD22-CAR/kg, complete remissions occurred in 9/10 patients 
who had received prior CD19 directed immunotherapy, including 5/5 who enrolled with 
CD19dim/neg B-ALL and 1 patient who was refractory to both CD19-CAR and 
blinatumomab (patient #11). Thus, we saw no evidence that previous CD19-directed 
immunotherapy or diminished expression of CD19 impacted response to CD22-CAR T 
cells. Figure 2B illustrates response in patient #2 whose leukemia had dim CD19 expression 
with substantial disease burden and experienced an MRD negative complete remission 
following infusion of 3×105 CAR T cells/kg. Similarly, patient #15 had complete absence of 
surface CD19 expression and high disease burden, but attained MRD negative remission 
with grade 1 CRS and considerable lymphocyte expansion (Figure 2C and D). Reponses 
were also seen in patients with extramedullary disease, including patient #13 who attained 
MRD negative marrow remission at day 28, with steady decrease in FDG-glucose uptake in 
lymphomatous disease, which fully resolved by 5 months post CAR infusion (Figure 2E).
Among the 4 non-responders at dose levels 2 and 3, two (patients #10 and #18) 
demonstrated very high disease burden with rapid disease progression, which may have 
contributed to lack of response. Two additional non-responders (patients #12 and #17) 
expressed dim or partial CD22 on leukemic blasts at the time of enrollment, which emerged 
following inotuzumab ozogamicin, an anti-CD22/calicheamicin conjugate,29 administered 
immediately prior to enrollment on this study.

 Serum cytokines were measured serially during the first month in all patients (Supplemental 
Figures 1 and 2, representative images). Similar to previous reports following CD19-CAR 
therapy, we saw a general correlation between high leukemia burden and high peak cytokine 
levels, as illustrated by patient #4 and patient #9.
Relapse is Associated with Diminished CD22 Site Density Without Detectable CD22 
Mutations or Changes in CD22 mRNA Level
Among the 12 patients who attained complete remission, 3 remain in ongoing complete 
remission at 21 mos, 9 mos, and 6 mos (Supplemental Table 4). Eight patients relapsed 1.5–
12 mos (median 6 months) post CD22-CAR infusion and relapse was associated with 
diminished CD22 expression in 7 patients (Figure 3A). Illustrative examples include patient 
#9, who enrolled with CD19 negative leukemia and experienced relapse 6 months following 
CD22-CAR therapy with blasts that were negative for both CD19 and CD22 (Figure 3B). 
Two patients who enrolled after receiving inotuzumab ozogamicin experienced early relapse 
including Patient #11, who relapsed at 1.5 mos following anti-CD22-CAR infusion with low 
but variable CD22 expression on leukemic blasts (Figure 3C) and patient #15 with CD19 
negative leukemia following CD19-CAR therapy who relapsed with variable dim to negative 
CD22 expression 2 months following CD22-CAR infusion (Figure 3D), despite high-levels 
of circulating CD22-CAR cells (Figure 2C).
Rather than the persistent and complete absence of target that has been reported following 
CD19 directed immunotherapy due to preferential expression of CD19 splice variants in 
resistant leukemia lacking the targeted epitope16, we observed a pattern of acquired 
resistance to CD22-CAR associated with diminished (Figure 3) and variable (Supplemental 
Figure 3) CD22 site density assessed by flow cytometry as described in Methods. To 
determine whether diminished CD22 site density may have had a causal role in relapse in 
this setting by enabling escape from CD22-CAR T cells, we assessed functionality of the 
CD22-CAR against NALM6 derived cell lines engineered to express varying CD22 site 
densities reflecting the range observed in this study (Figure 4A). IFN-gamma (Figure 4B) 
and IL-2 (Figure 4C) production by CD22-CAR T cells was reduced following exposure to 
NALM6 expressing low CD22 density corresponding to levels observed at the time of 
relapse in patients following CD22-CAR therapy. Finally, although CD22 CAR T cells delay 
in vivo progression of CD22lo ALL, leukemia progression eventually ensues (Figure 4D). 
These results implicate diminished CD22 expression on B-ALL as a mechanism for relapse 
following CD22-CAR therapy.
To identify possible genetic or transcriptomic mechanisms underlying the observed 
alteration in CD22 site density, longitudinal assessment of the CD22 genomic locus and 
corresponding mRNA was evaluated in two patients who relapsed following CD22-CAR 
with diminished CD22 site density. Genome-wide copy number profiles of the leukemias 
remained stable despite substantial changes in CD22 site density. Heterozygosity of the 
CD22 locus was maintained and no focal copy number changes were observed. Mutation 
analysis comparing the pre-treatment and post-treatment samples demonstrated no aquired 
mutations within the CD22 locus (Figure 5A, Supplemental Figure 4A). Corresponding 
analysis of CD22 mRNA levels pre- and post-CD22 CAR treatment demonstrated no

 qualitative change in the observed CD22 transcripts, and no evidence for diminished 
transcription of CD22, since in each case, total CD22 mRNA levels were slightly increased 
at the time that CD22 site density was diminished (Figure 5B, Supplemental Figure 4B). We 
saw no evidence for alternative CD22 isoforms as a cause of the downmodulation of CD22 
expression observed although a novel isoform cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, we studied 
a patient derived xenograft model in mice subjected to pressure with CD22-CAR T cells 
which induced complete loss of CD22 surface expression. Remarkably, such leukemias 
again showed no evidence for genetic mutation, changes in gene copy number or isoform 
expression and no evidence for diminished mRNA expression (Figure 5D and E). Together, 
the data implicate post-transcriptional effects in modulating CD22 protein levels rather 
genomic mutation, modulation of gene expression or altered isoform expression.
A bispecific CAR targeting both CD19 and CD22 can recognize and kill CD19+CD22+, 
CD19−CD22+ and CD22+CD19− B-ALL
Multi-agent combination chemotherapy is a central tenet of ALL therapy. The results 
presented here credential a novel CAR-based therapeutic for the treatment of B-ALL, but 
also illustrate the challenges associated with sequential administration of CD19 CAR 
followed by CD22 CAR therapy. We therefore sought to develop a multi-specific CAR T 
cell which could simultaneously recognize CD19 or CD22 expressing targets. Using a single 
CAR construct that incorporates both CD19 and CD22 scFv sequences into one bivalent 
receptor (Figure 6A), we demonstrate in vitro cytokine production against and killing of 
CD19+/CD22+, CD19+/CD22−, and CD22−CD19+ cell B-ALL cell lines (Figures 6B and 
C, Supplemental Figure 5). T cells transduced with this mutispecific construct administered 
intravenously at a dose 3 × 106 into NSG mice 3 days after injection of luciferase-expressing 
B-ALL demonstrate the ability to clear B-ALL (Figure 6D). Thus, the binding domain in the 
CD22 CAR validated in the clinical trial reported here can be combined with a CD19 
binding domain validated as a CAR construct in multiple clinical trials to generate a single 
multitarget CAR with the potential to overcome leukemic resitance to either CAR 
administered alone.
DISCUSSION
CD22, a sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (SIGLEC), expressed exclusively 
within the B cell lineage, is expressed on the vast majority of B cell malignancies, including 
B-ALL, indolent and high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 
and hairy cell leukemia.14,19,20,32,33 Numerous CD22 directed therapeutics have been 
studied in clinical trials. Epratuzumab, an unconjugated anti-CD22 mAb, mediated modest 
clinical activity in adult and pediatric ALL.21,26,27 CD22-immunotoxins mediated clinical 
activity in hairy cell leukemia23 and B-ALL22, but benefits were transient due to the agent’s 
short half-life, and substantial immunogenicity. A recent phase 3 trial of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin, an anti-CD22 mAb conjugated to the toxin calicheamicin, demonstrated 
complete responses in 80.7% of patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL.29 However, liver 
toxicity limited the dose intensity that could be safely delivered and the agent is associated 
with higher rates of veno-occlusive disease following subsequent HSCT.24,34

 We generated a novel CAR targeting CD22, which we optimized by comparing potency 
across multiple scFvs and multiple costimulatory domains.19,30,35 Therapeutics 
incorporating the m971 binding domain30 have not been tested previously in clinical trials. 
The data presented here demonstrate no evidence for off-target toxicity, modest cytokine 
release syndrome and potent anti-leukemic activity following CD22-CAR therapy. Doses ≥ 1 
× 106 CD22-CAR cells/kg mediated substantial anti-leukemic activity, comparable to results 
with CD19-CAR, with 11/15 patients rendered into complete remission, including 8/10 
patients previously treated with CD19 based immunotherapies, and 5/5 patients who 
enrolled with CD19 neg/dim relapse. Notably, all patients enrolled had undergone previous 
HSCT and patient #7 who had undergone two previous HSCTs prior to receiving CD22 
CAR T-cells, remains in remission 21 months following CD22-CAR therapy with persistent 
CAR T cells and has received no additional anti-leukemic therapy since treatment with 
CD22-CAR T cells. Together, the data provides no evidence to suggest that previous 
chemotherapy or CD19-based immunotherapy diminishes the likelihood of remission 
induction following bioactive doses of CD22-CAR T cells. The CD22-CAR studied here 
incorporates a 4-1BB costimulatory endodomain, and the cells demonstrate a pattern of 
expansion and persistence that is similar to that observed following CD19-CAR T cells 
incorporating a 4-1BB endodomain, consistent with previous evidence that CAR 
costimulatory domains play a dominant role in modulating the rate of expansion and the 
likelihood of persistence following CAR therapy.35 CD22-CAR cells also migrated 
efficiently to the CSF, but we observed no evidence for severe neurologic toxicity or 
seizures, which have been observed in studies of CD19-CAR therapy.11–13
CARs targeting CD19 have demonstrated remarkable activity in B-ALL and diffuse large B 
cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and we demonstrate similar complete response rates in B-ALL 
with the CD22-CAR tested here. This is notable since numerous non-CD19 targeted CARs 
have entered clinical trials for B cell malignancies, (CD20-CAR36, κ-CAR37, CD138-
CAR38, BCMA-CAR39), AML40 and solid tumors, yet none of these have demonstrated 
complete responses rates of >50%. This work therefore provides the first evidence that 
CD19 is not a uniquely effective CAR T cell target and raise the prospect that similarly 
effective CARs could ultimately be developed for an array of antigenic targets. Future 
studies are needed to determine whether the high rates observed with CD22-CARs in B-
ALL will translate into similarly significant response rates in DLBCL, where CD22 
expression is common.
CD19 is universally expressed at high levels on B-ALL at the time of diagnosis and is 
retained following cytotoxic therapy.41–43 However, since the introduction of CD19-based 
immunotherapies, relapse with diminished or absent surface CD19 has been increasingly 
observed and has emerged as the dominant mechanism of resistance to this class of 
therapeutics. CD19 immune escape was first reported following blinatumumab therapy10, 
but has now been observed by several groups following CD19-CAR therapy.12,44 In a recent 
report of 50 patients rendered into remission with CD19-CAR therapy, with a median 
follow-up of 10.6 months, 40% of patients had relapsed, and loss of the CD19 target 
accounted for 65% of the total relapses.17 Thus, while the true incidence is unknown, CD19 
immune escape is emerging as the most common cause of relapse following CD19-CAR 
therapy for B-ALL. Recent investigation into the biology of “CD19 negative B-ALL” has

 revealed that the majority of cases retain mRNA specific for CD19, but are enriched for 
CD19 isoforms that preferentially remain intracellular and/or lack the epitopes targeted by 
all CD19-CARs currently under study as well as blinatumumab.16 An alternative pathway 
for loss or diminished CD19 expression involves lineage switch of blasts with acquisition of 
myeloid markers and characteristics.45 None of the patients enrolled on this study appeared 
to manifest CD19 loss associated with lineage switch.
The data presented here demonstrate that diminished CD22 site density, rather than total loss 
of expression, is sufficient to permit escape of leukemia from CD22-directed CAR therapy. 
This is not unique to the CD22-CAR, but rather reflects a pattern observed across chimeric 
antigen receptors, which demonstrate a higher requirement for antigen induced activation 
than is seen for native T cell receptors46–49. Decrease in CD22 site density or complete 
CD22 loss were observed in 7/8 patients who relapsed following CD22-CAR induced 
remission. Given that CD22 expression is often variable at presentation, it appears likely that 
this phenomena represents selection of pre-existing CD22lo cells within the heterogeneous 
leukemia population. Notably, we identified no genetic basis for the change in expression 
level and no evidence for diminished mRNA levels in leukemic cells demonstrating low 
CD22 site density, thus implicating post-transcriptional mechanisms in this biology. 
Regardless of the mechanism, decades of experience with cytotoxic chemotherapy for B-
ALL have convincingly established that multimodal chemotherapy is required to achieve 
long-term remission. Based on clear evidence for CD19 antigen loss or downregulation 
following CD19-directed immunotherapy, and evidence for diminished CD22 expression 
contributing to relapse following sequential CAR therapy, we propose that simultaneous 
immunotherapeutic targeting of multiple antigens may diminish the likelihood of antigen 
loss escape. Proof-of-principle for bioactivity of a multispecific CD19/CD22-CAR in mice 
is demonstrated here.
The majority of patients who develop CD19 immune escape following CD19 directed 
immunotherapy retain CD22 expression and this report demonstrates that such leukemias 
retain susceptible to immune-based targeting. Furthermore, while we demonstrate proof-of 
principle that sequential immunotherapeutic targeting of a second antigen can mediate 
clinical benefit, we also observe a high rate of relapse associated with diminution in CD22 
expression using this approach, raising the prospect that simultaneous multispecific targeting 
may be a more effective approach to enhance the durability of immunotherapy-induced 
remissions in B-ALL. Toward this end, we have developed a chimeric antigen receptor that 
simultaneously targets both CD19 and CD22, which could prove more effective at inducing 
remissions and be less susceptible to relapse associated with antigen escape50. Clinical trials 
testing this CD19/CD22 mutispecific target CAR are underway.
METHODS
Trial Design and Toxicity Monitoring
This Phase I, first-in-human, dose escalation trial conducted at the Pediatric Oncology 
Branch of the National Cancer Institute was designed to test the safety and feasibility of 
CD22-CAR T cell therapy in children and young adults, aged 1–30 years, with relapsed or 
refractory CD22 expressing hematopoietic malignancies which had not responded to or had

 recurred following standard regimens. The protocol was approved by the NCI Institutional 
Review Board and the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (NCT02315612). All 
authors reviewed, discussed and interpreted the study results and vouch for the data and 
analyses. Written informed consent for participation was obtained from patients or the 
parents according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the protocol was approved by the 
National Cancer Institute Institutional Review Board.. This report represents an interim 
analysis from the first, consecutively treated 21 patients with pre-B ALL who received 
CD22-CAR T cell infusions between December 2014 and August 2016 with a data cut-off of 
June 1, 2017. A total of 23 subjects were enrolled, but in one case T lymphocyte numbers 
were inadequate for CAR cell production and thus this patient was not treated on study; in a 
second case the diagnosis was diffuse large B cell lymphoma, which is not included in this 
analysis of efficacy in B-ALL.
A standard 3 + 3 Phase I dose escalation design was used. If 2/6 patients experienced a DLT 
at dose level 1, safety would have been evaluated in a de-escalated dose of 1 × 105 
transduced T cells/kg. Once the maximum tolerated dose (or highest level evaluated) was 
reached, enrollment into an expansion cohort of a total of 12 patients in two strata proceeded 
to provide additional information regarding the feasibility, safety and efficacy of this 
treatment. In the expansion cohort, patients who have previously received CD19-CAR T 
cells will be evaluated as a separate stratum from CAR-naïve patients. All doses allowed a 
range of ± 20% of the prescribed dose to allow for potential variations in the cell products.
Dose limiting toxicity was defined as any ≥ Grade 3 toxicity attributed as possibly, probably, 
or likely related to either the lymphodepletion regimen or the CD22-CAR T cells with 
exception of low electrolyte levels responding to supplementation, tumor lysis syndrome, 
hypoalbuminemia, liver dysfunction resolved to < grade 2 within 14 days, transient (< 72 
hours) grade 4 hepatic enzyme abnormality, pre-existing coagulopathy, grade 3 or 4 fever 
lasting 7 days or less, grade 3 diarrhea that resolves to grade 2 within 4 days, grade 3 nausea 
and/or anorexia and any infusion related toxicity occurring within 24 hours that would 
resolve with minimal intervention. and grade 3 cytokine release syndrome. Cytokine release 
syndrome was graded and managed based on Lee et al.51 Additionally, subjects with 
abnormal blood counts at baseline due to marrow involvement were not evaluable for 
hematologic toxicity.
To evaluate possible neurotoxic effects, psychologists administered a brief (<1 hour) 
neurocognitive battery to patients prior to (baseline) and 1-month after (day 21–28) CD22 
CAR T cell infusion. The test battery consisted of the NIH Toolbox computerized test1 
evaluating attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and a paper/pencil test assessing 
processing speed2. At baseline and then at approximately 14 and 21 days post-infusion, the 
caregiver of the patient or the adult patient completed a neuro-symptom checklist that 
assessed fever, auditory or visual hallucinations, responsiveness to commands, 
disorientation, depressed mood, and pain.52

that would limit their ability to tolerate or comply with the study requirements were 
ineligible. Patients were also ineligible if they demonstrated seropositivity for HIV or HCV 
or positive testing for HBV surface antigen or if they had a history of hypersensitivity to 
agents required for the treatment regimen. Other exclusion criteria included inadequate liver 
function defined as total bilirubin > 2× upper limit of normal (ULN) (except for patients 
with documented Gilbert’s) or transaminase levels > 3× ULN; renal function < 60 mL/min/
1.73 m2 or hyperleukocytosis (≥50,000 circulating blasts/uL).

CD22 CAR Construct and Manufacturing of CD22-CAR T cells
The CD22-CAR contains a fully human single chain fragment variable region generated 
from a human B cell phage library30, a CD8 transmembrane domain and CD3 zeta plus 
4-1BB signaling chains (CD22.BB.z) as previously described and as illustrated in Figure 
1A.19,35 All patients received the identical preparative regimen consisting of fludarabine 25 
mg/m2/d on Days −4, −3, −2 and cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m2 on day −2, with CD22-
CAR T cell infusion on Day 0. Additional details can be found in the Supplementary 
Methods.
CD22-CAR T cells were produced in the Cell Processing Section of the Department of 
Transfusion Medicine, NIH Clinical Center. This laboratory operates under principles of 
Good Manufacturing Practices and Good Clinical Laboratory Practice with established 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and/or protocols for sample receipt, processing, 
freezing, and analysis. All patients underwent leukapheresis within 5 days following 
enrollment. Leukapheresed peripheral blood mononuclear cells were either placed directly 
into culture or cryopreserved prior to culture initiation on a subsequent day. In cases where

 substantial numbers of myeloid cells were present in the apheresis products, elutriation 
and/or plastic adherence53 was performed based on evidence that such cells inhibited 
expansion54. The lentiviral vector containing CD22.BB.Z-CAR, was produced by Lentigen 
Inc. Cells were expanded in sterile bags in a 37oC incubator for 9 days, with an additional 3 
days of culture permitted to allow resolution of intercurrent clinical events. If > 3 days was 
required, cells were cryopreserved then thawed immediately prior to infusion. Final product 
release criteria required the following: cell viability ≥ 70%, cell number within 20% of 
planned dose, % CAR T cells ≥ 15% as measured using CD22-Fc fusion protein, endotoxin 
≤ 5 EU/mL, Mycoplasma negative, gram stain and culture negative, VSV-G DNA (as a 
surrogate marker for replication competent lentivirus (RCL)) negative by qPCR. In process 
culture-based testing was also performed on an aliquot of the product at the National Gene 
Vector Laboratory (Indiana University) using assays for p24 antigen and product-enhanced 
reverse transcriptase assay (PERT) to complete testing for RCL.
Response Monitoring
Baseline bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and lumbar puncture were performed within 14 
days prior to beginning the lymphodepletion preparative regimen, and then response was 
monitored via bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and lumbar puncture performed on Day 28 
± 4 days from cell infusion, and at months 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Complete remission 
(CR) was defined by morphologic assessment of the bone marrow as M1 (<5% leukemic 
blasts) with no evidence of extramedullary disease. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was 
assessed by multiparametric flow cytometry conducted at the NCI Laboratory of Pathology 
using standard techniques.
Cytokine Assays, PCR and Flow cytometry
Plasma was cryopreserved before measurement of cytokines in a multiplex format according 
to manufacturer's instructions (MesoScaleDiscovery, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). CD22-CAR 
T cell expansion was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Life Technologies, Grand 
Island, NY, USA), and adapted from published methods55. Briefly, measured CAR copies 
per 100 ng DNA were normalised to the input quantity of amplifiable DNA by measurement 
of the single-copy gene, CDKN1a.
Specimens for flow cytometry were processed within 12 h of collection and stained with a 
panel of antibodies to quantitate leukemic burden and measure CAR T cells numbers. 
Briefly whole blood lysis was performed using ammonium chloride prior to staining for 30 
minutes at room temperature with the following two cocktails (antibody concentration 
according to manufacturer’s recommendations): Cocktail A- CD16FITC (clone DJ130c, 
Dako), CD19PE (clone SJ25C1), CD3PerCP (clone SK7, BD), CD13PECy7 (L138, BD), 
CD34APC (clone 8G12, BD), CD14 APC H7 (MP9, BD), CD56v450 (clone B159, BD), 
CD45 v500 (clone HI30, BD); and Cocktail B-CD66bFITC (clone G10F5, BD), CD22PE 
(clone S-HCL-1, BD), CD34PerCP5.5 (clone8G12, BD), CD19PECy7 (clone SJ25C1, BD), 
CD24APC (clone SN3 A5-2H10, eBioscience), CD45 APC H7 (clone 2D1, BD), 
CD10BV421 (cloneHI10a, BD) and CD38BV510 (clone HB-7, Biolegend). At least 1 
million cells were acquired per tube using an 8-color multiparametric approach on a 3-laser 
FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) with DiVa 6.1.1 software and analyzed by

 FCS Express 4 software (DeNovo Software, Los Angeles, CA). The validated limit of 
detection of leukemic blasts with this assay is 0.002% of cells.
CD22-CAR T cells were measured using a CD22-Fc (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). 
Circulating CAR T-cell numbers were calculated on the basis of estimated blood volume and 
measured absolute lymphocyte counts. CAR T-cells were detected using the following 
cocktail: CD20FITC (B-Ly1, Dako), CD10PE (cloneHI10a, BD), CD34PerCP5.5 
(clone8G12, BD), CD19PECy7 (clone SJ25C1, BD), CD22-Fc-APC (R&D Systems), 
CD3APC-H7 (clone SK7, BD), CD14 v450 (Mtems), CD3APC-H7 (clone SK7, BD), 
CD19PECy7 (clone SJ25C1, BD), , CD10PE s instructions (QuantiBRITE Beads, BD 
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).E content of the Quanti-BRITE beads was constructed 
using QuantiCALC software. Circulating CAR T-cell numbers were calculated on the basis 
of estimated blood volume and measured absolute lymphocyte counts.
CD19 and CD22 Flow Cytometric Site Density Determination
CD22 and CD19 site density on blasts was enumerated by flow cytometry according to 
manufacturer's instructions (QuantiBRITE Beads, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). 
The antibody bound per cell (ABC) was determined as previously described56,57 for anti-
CD19PE (clone SJ25C1) and anti-CD22PE (clone S-HCL-1) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, 
CA) on leukemic blasts using saturating concentrations of antibody and the BD Biosciences 
QuantiBRITE system (QuantiBRITE standard beads and QuantiCALC software) for 
fluorescence quantitation. The ABC value represents the mean value of the maximum 
capacity of each cell to bind the antibody. QuantiBRITE PE beads are pre-calibrated 
standard beads containing known numbers of PE molecules bound per bead. QuantiBRITE 
beads were acquired on a FACSCanto™II (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) on the same day 
at the same instrument settings as the individual patient specimens. A standard curve 
comparing the geometric mean of fluorescence to known PE content of the Quanti-BRITE 
beads was constructed using QuantiCALC software. The regression analysis, slope, 
intercept, and correlation coefficient were determined. By gating based upon 
immunophenotype, blasts were distinguished from normal cells and the geometric mean 
fluorescence of CD19 and CD22 staining was reported for each population. The ABC values 
were generated from the measured geometric mean fluorescence of the gated cells using the 
QuantiBRITE standard curve. ABC values were only determined for populations containing 
100 or greater events to achieve adequate precision. The geometric mean fluorescence of T- 
and NK-cells stained with the B-cell antibodies (negative control) has been previously 
determined and the negative ABC range is used to confirm positivity versus negativity. In 
addition, blasts with anti-CD19 or anti-CD22 staining less than or equal to T-cells (internal 
negative control) are considered negative.
CRISPR/Cas9 Editing of cell lines
Guide-RNAs were designed from the GeCKO human sgRNAs library, cloned into 
LentiCRISPR v2 plasmid (Addgene Plasmid 52961), and transformed into Stbl3 bacteria as 
previously published (hCD19F: 5’ CACCGTGGAATGTTTCGGACCTAGG 3’, hCD19R: 
5’ AAACCCTAGGTCCGAAACATTCCAC 3’, hCD22F: 5’ 
CACCGTCTCCTTCTCGAATCGGCAT 3’, and hCD22R: 5’

 AAACATGCCGATTCGAGAAGGAGAC 3’). Plasmids were co-transfected with packaging 
plasmids RRE, pMD-G, and REV into LentiX HEK293T cells (Clontech, Mountain View, 
CA, USA). After two days, CRISPR supernatants were harvested and filtered through a 
0.45µm low protein binding membrane (Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA), 
concentrated using Lenti-X concentrator (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), 
resuspended in PBS, and used immediately or stored at −80°C. For viral transduction, 1×105 
leukemia cells were incubated with 10µl of concentrated viral supernatant for 2 days, 
followed by expansion in RPMI with 10%FBS, Pen/Strep, and Glutamax. Cell phenotype 
was assessed by flow cytometry, followed by sorting of cells with phenotypic alterations and 
single cell cloning. Sequencing was performed on single cell clones to confirm genotypic 
alterations by Plantinum PCR Supermix High Fidelity Kit (Invitrogen) (hCD19F Seq: 5’ 
TCTCCCTCTCCTGGGTG 3’, hCD19R Seq: 5’ CTCTCCCTCCCAGATCTCAG 3’, 
hCD22F Seq: 5’ AGGAGGGAAGGGGTACTG 3’, and hCD22R Seq: 5’ 
AGCCAACGTTTTGGATCTTCAG 3’). To obtain cell lines with various CD22 site 
densities, a complete sequence of cDNA human CD22 plasmid (Origene) was re-transduced 
into the CD22-negative cell line at different concentrations. Cell lines were single-cell 
cloned with resultant cell lines including CD22-negative (CD22neg), CD19-negative 
(CD19neg), CD2-low site density (CD22lo), and CD22-high site density (CD22hi) cell lines. 
QuantiBRITE Beads (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) were used, as per above 
description to identify site density of CRISPR/Cas9-modified cell lines.
CD19xCD22 Bispecific CAR
A Bispecific CAR construct was developed using a CD19 binding domain derived from a 
clinically active CD19 CAR12 and a CD22 binding domain used for the CD22 CAR reported 
herein. A schematic of the CD19xCD22 bispecific CAR is shown in Figure 4A and the full 
sequence is provided Supplemental Figure 6.
The bispecific CAR was transduced onto human T cells using lentiviral vectors. The potency 
of the bispecific CAR was tested against the CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out cell lines as well as 
parental Nalm6 ALL cell line. Cytokine production was analyzed in cell co-culture 
supernatants using R&D ELISA Kit for Interferon-gamma and IL-2, following the product 
protocol (R&D Systems Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA). In brief, CD22 CAR T cells were 
washed three times and co-incubated with varying tumor target cells at 1:1 effector-to-target 
ratio for 16–20 hours. Supernatant was collected from co-incubation and used for evaluation 
of cytokine production. Of note, supernatant was diluted 1:10 in media for Interferon-
gamma analysis. Supernatant was not diluted for IL-2 evaluation. Optical density was 
determined within 30 minutes, using a microplate reader set to 450nm with wavelength 
correction of 540nm. In vitro killing was analyzed using an Incucyte assay (Essen 
bioscience). CAR cells were co-incubated with GFP-positive tumor target cells at a range of 
effector-to-target ratio. At the 24-hour time-point, Green Fluorescent Units per well (GFU/
well) was calculated using Incucyte software, standardized to baseline GFU/well and 
normalized to tumor only wells. Assays were performed in triplicate and data is 
representative of multiple repeat experiments.

 Xenograft Models
In vivo analysis of CAR activity was conducted using a xenograft model with NOD.Cg-
Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG, Jackson Laboratories) mice. Mice were injected 
intravenously with 1×106 GFP-positive Nalm6 tumor cells on Day 0. On Day CAR-
transduced T cells or Mock-transduced T cells were injected as indicated. Mice were imaged 
using IVIS technology and luciferin-D IP injections. All animal studies were approved by 
National Cancer Institute Animal Care and Use Committee.
Genomic Profiling
All primary patient samples were collected on IRB approved protocols for biological 
specimen research. Leukemia samples from bone marrow specimens containing greater than 
90% leukemia were isolated by density gradient separation using Lymphocyte Separation 
Medium (Lonzo). The cells were lysed and nucleic acid extraction was performed using 
Qiagen Allprep Kits (Qiagen) per the manufactures protocol. DNA and RNA were 
quantified and assessed for quality using an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer. Poly-adenylated 
RNA libraries were generated and sequenced using TruSeq 4.0 chemistry on a Hiseq2500 
(Illumina). Whole exome data was generated using Agilent SureSelectXT Human All Exon 
V5 and TruSeq V4 chemistry and sequenced to a median of 300× coverage using on a 
HiSeq2500 (Illumina).
Whole exome and RNA-sequencing data was analyzed and mapped using the CCR 
Collaborative Bioinformatics Resource (CCBR) pipeline (https://
bioinformatics.cancer.gov/). Reads were aligned to reference genome Hg19. Somatic variant 
calling was performed using MuTect58 and copy number alterations were analyzed using 
Nexus Copy Number Discovery Edition #9. (BioDiscovery). The integrity of the CD22 gene 
was interrogated by manual inspection using Integrative Genome Viewer (IGV). 
RNAsequencing reads for each sample were trimmed of their adapters and low quality bases 
using Trimmomatic software and aligned with reference human Hg38 and Gencode V24 
transcripts using STAR software. Expression of CD22 transcript was evaluated using a log2 
of the RPKM of RNAseq data.
Statistical Analyses
Doses of anti-CD22-CAR transduced T-cells were administered in a standard 3 + 3 dose 
escalation design until MTD was determined. After treatment of the first patient in the first 
cohort there was a four-week (28 day) safety assessment prior to treatment of the second 
patient. Subsequent patients in a cohort were treated after a one-week safety assessment 
period following cell infusion. Patients were enrolled sequentially; therefore, enrollment did 
not proceed to a higher dose level until all patients had been treated in the prior cohort and 
the last patient treated on the completed cohort had been observed for at least 4 weeks. If a 
minimum of 1 ×105 anti-CD22-CAR-transduced T cells per kg cannot be obtained for 
infusion, the patient may be treated but would not be evaluable for toxicity or response, but 
would be considered a feasibility failure. Up to 6 evaluable patients may be enrolled in 
cohorts 1 to 4 (24 total in order to determine MTD. In addition, the study will allow for up to 
3 patients to be replaced in each of the dose cohorts 1 through 3 (9 additional patients) due 
to inability to achieve target doses. In addition, the study will allow for 6 total in-evaluable
