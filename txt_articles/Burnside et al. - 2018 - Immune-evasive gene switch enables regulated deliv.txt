Chondroitinase ABC is a promising preclinical therapy that promotes functional neuroplasticity after CNS injury by degrading
extracellular matrix inhibitors. Efficient delivery of chondroitinase ABC to the injured mammalian spinal cord can be achieved by
viral vector transgene delivery. This approach dramatically modulates injury pathology and restores sensorimotor functions.
However, clinical development of this therapy is limited by a lack of ability to exert control over chondroitinase gene expression.
Prior experimental gene regulation platforms are likely to be incompatible with the non-resolving adaptive immune response
known to occur following spinal cord injury. Therefore, here we apply a novel immune-evasive dual vector system, in which
the chondroitinase gene is under a doxycycline inducible regulatory switch, utilizing a chimeric transactivator designed to evade T
cell recognition. Using this novel vector system, we demonstrate tight temporal control of chondroitinase ABC gene expression,
effectively removing treatment upon removal of doxycycline. This enables a comparison of short and long-term gene therapy
paradigms in the treatment of clinically-relevant cervical level contusion injuries in adult rats. We reveal that transient treatment
(2.5 weeks) is sufficient to promote improvement in sensory axon conduction and ladder walking performance. However, in tasks
requiring skilled reaching and grasping, only long term treatment (8 weeks) leads to significantly improved function, with rats able
to accurately grasp and retrieve sugar pellets. The late emergence of skilled hand function indicates enhanced neuroplasticity and
connectivity and correlates with increased density of vGlut1+ innervation in spinal cord grey matter, particularly in lamina III–IV
above and below the injury. Thus, our novel gene therapy system provides an experimental tool to study temporal effects of
extracellular matrix digestion as well as an encouraging step towards generating a safer chondroitinase gene therapy strategy,
longer term administration of which increases neuroplasticity and recovery of descending motor control. This preclinical study
could have a significant impact for tetraplegic individuals, for whom recovery of hand function is an important determinant of
independence, and supports the ongoing development of chondroitinase gene therapy towards clinical application for the treatment
of spinal cord injury.

Introduction
Spinal cord injury results in permanent disruption to ner-
vous system function, for which there is no current regen-
erative or pathology-modifying treatment (Ramer et al.,
2014). Following CNS injury, reactive glia synthesize
and
secrete
chondroitin
sulfate
proteoglycans
(CSPGs)
into
the
extracellular
matrix
(McKeon
et
al.,
1991).
CSPGs have one or more covalently attached chondroitin
sulfate glycosaminoglycan (CS-GAG) side-chains, which
are known to inhibit neuronal extension and plasticity.
Removal
of
CS-GAGs
by
the
chondroitinase
ABC
(ChABC) enzyme reverses neurite growth arrest in vitro
(Smith-Thomas et al., 1994), enhances CNS axonal regen-
eration and neuroplasticity in vivo (Moon et al., 2001;
Alilain et al., 2011) and promotes functional recovery fol-
lowing spinal cord injury in adult rats (Bradbury et al.,
2002; Garcia-Alias et al., 2009). This effect has been repli-
cated across multiple laboratories, species and CNS injury
models (Bradbury and Carter, 2011), and recently in a
canine clinical trial (Hu et al., 2018). A gene therapy
method of enzyme delivery, where host cells are them-
selves transduced to express the ChABC gene, circumvents
the need for repeated, invasive administration of the
enzyme, which has low thermal stability (Lee et al.,
2010) and a short half-life that is thought to limit efficacy
in severe models of trauma that mimic clinical pathology
(Tom et al., 2009). We have previously reported a gene
therapy strategy whereby optimization of the prokaryotic
ChABC gene to render it compatible with translation and
secretion from mammalian cells (Muir et al., 2010) and
incorporation of this gene into viral vectors (Zhao et al.,
2011), leads to high levels of ChABC gene expression and
active enzyme release in vivo. This results in extensive CS-
GAG digestion across many segments of the mammalian
spinal cord (Bartus et al., 2014). This large scale matrix
modification leads to reduced tissue pathology and im-
proved functional recovery following contusion injury to
the thoracic (Bartus et al., 2014) and cervical (James et al.,
2015) spinal cord. Thus, ChABC gene therapy is a pro-
mising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of spinal cord
injury.
However, uncontrolled gene expression can limit or even
reverse therapeutic benefits (Georgievska et al., 2004; Fouad
et al., 2013). Therefore, the ability to both administer and
remove any treatment has a key advantage over permanent
application in the development of clinically feasible strate-
gies. Furthermore, most current clinical applications of gene
therapy for treating human disorders are targeted mainly to
rare genetic conditions with rapid progressive decline or fatal
neurodegenerative diseases (Mendell et al., 2017), where any
negative effects of gene delivery, which cannot be switched
off, carry less risk in terms of cost-to-benefit analysis
(Bender, 2016). Spinal injured individuals, however, repre-
sent a higher risk group for irreversible gene therapy since
they are a relatively stable population. Following the initial
trauma, early surgical and medical interventions and a
period of adjustment during which any spontaneous recov-
ery reaches a plateau, the majority of spinal injured individ-
uals remain in a stable condition for the rest of their lives,
albeit severely debilitated (Ahuja et al., 2017). Thus, an im-
portant safety consideration in the development of gene
therapies for spinal cord injury and other long term neuro-
logical disorders is the ability to control transgene expres-
sion. Effective methods of regulating gene expression in the
CNS would also expand the number of conditions that are
amenable to gene therapy treatment. While there is no evi-
dence that sustained ChABC gene therapy, at least for up to
12 weeks, has any negative effects in rats (Bartus et al.,
2014), given its potent effects on neuroplasticity, the ability
to switch off the gene represents a significant step towards
generating a more clinically feasible treatment. Moreover, it
provides an experimental tool to ask how temporal regula-
tion of ChABC delivery influences treatment efficacy. This
could provide important insight regarding therapeutic timing
since, despite a wealth of positive preclinical findings, little is
known as to how timing of ChABC administration could
affect functional outcome and whether long term adminis-
tration would have any additional advantage over acute
transient delivery. Doxycycline-regulated Tet-On systems
are widely used inducible gene expression platforms that
have been optimized for use in vitro (Urlinger et al., 2000;
Zhou et al., 2006; Loew et al., 2010) and have shown prom-
ise in some in vivo experiments (Stieger et al., 2009).
However, particularly when studies are scaled-up to testing
in non-human primates, experiments have shown that an
immune response may be generated against the system trans-
activator, resulting in cytotoxic T cell-mediated removal of
cells expressing the therapeutic transgene (Favre et al., 2002;
Latta-Mahieu et al., 2002; Ginhoux et al., 2004). This phe-
nomenon was not overcome by replacing activation domains
with humanized moieties (Le Guiner et al., 2014). Hence,
in vivo use, and further translation of transactivator-based
systems is compromised by immune recognition and re-
moval. The injured spinal cord has a complex and non-resol-
ving inflammatory profile, comprising both innate and

 adaptive responders (Fleming et al., 2006; Pruss et al., 2011;
reviewed in Ankeny and Popovich, 2009; David and Kroner,
2011) and removal of cells expressing a therapeutic trans-
gene would not only prevent treatment, but could itself
confer damaging neuronal or glial loss if these cells are
transduced to express the transgene. We therefore sought
to use an immune-stealth modification, created by fusing
the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator with a gly-
cine-alanine repeat (GARrtTA) (Zaldumbide et al., 2010;
Hoyng et al., 2014), which is known to enable the
Epstein-Barr virus to evade T lymphocyte-mediated removal
(Levitskaya et al., 1997; Yin et al., 2003). This enabled the
development of a potentially immunologically-inert, doxy-
cycline-inducible, gene delivery system to stably and control-
lably
deliver
ChABC
to
injured
tissue
within
the
environment of a traumatic spinal cord injury.
Here we assess the efficacy of a novel dual lentiviral
immune-evasive
doxycycline-inducible
ChABC
(dox-i-
ChABC)
vector
system.
In
this
system
ChABC
gene
expression is regulated via the widely clinically-available
broad-spectrum antibiotic doxycycline (dox). Since the ma-
jority of spinal injured individuals are injured at the cer-
vical level (National Spinal Cord Statistical Centre, 2017)
and a top priority for improving independence and quality of
life is recovery of hand and digit function (Anderson, 2004),
we investigate the effect of dox-i-ChABC treatment following
a clinically relevant cervical spinal contusion injury model in
adult rats. This model closely mimics the pathology and pro-
gression of spinal cord injury found clinically and affects
functions of the upper limb and hand. We demonstrate effect-
ive regulation of ChABC delivery following injury, where
doxycycline administration and removal controls ChABC
gene expression. Using this tool, we switch on ChABC tran-
siently or maintain delivery long term following injury and
demonstrate task-specific therapeutic temporal dependence,
whereby short-term dox-i-ChABC treatment is sufficient to
mediate improvements in a task of sensorimotor ability that
correlates with increased ascending sensory transmission and
sustained dox-i-ChABC treatment confers additional later
benefit in a measure of skilled hand function, associated
with anatomical evidence of neuroplasticity of descending
motor pathways.
Materials and methods
Generation and in vitro testing of the
immune-evasive dox-i-ChABC
system
The mammalian-compatible ChABC gene has been described
previously (Muir et al., 2010). Briefly, the gene contains
codons optimized for expression in mammalian cells, an opti-
mized 50 Kozak sequence, and a mouse matrix metalloprotei-
nase-2 signal sequence for secretion. It is also modified by
removal of specific post-translational N-glycosylation sites,
which impede passage of the prokaryotic enzyme through
the eukaryotic secretory machinery (Muir et al., 2010). This
transgene
was
cloned
into
a
lentiviral
transfer
vector
(pRRLsin-PPth) where gene expression is under control of a
tetracycline response element (TRE) comprising eight TetO re-
peats (p8teto-36�I) and a cytomegalovirus minimal promoter
(Agha-Mohammadi
et
al.,
2004;
Hoyng
et
al.,
2014)
(pLV.TRE.ChABC). A second transfer vector was generated
in
which
the
immune-evasive
transactivator
GARrtTA
(Zaldumbide et al., 2010) is constitutively expressed from a
full-length PGK1/PGK promoter (pLV.PGK.GARrtTA).
In vitro assessment of dox-i-ChABC plasmids
Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells grown in
SensiCellTM
medium
supplemented
with
10%
foetal
calf
serum (FCS) were plated into 6-well plates and left overnight
to achieve 70% confluency. Cells were then washed twice with
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium and transfected using
XfectTM (Clontech) in serum free medium for 4 h, with a
total
of
3 mg
DNA
consisting
of
the
TRE.ChABC
and
PGK.GARrtTA
plasmids
in
a
ratio
of
1:4
and
0.3 mg
pAdVAntageTM
plasmid
(Promega).
pAdVAntageTM
was
added to enhance expression of the ChABC gene (Muir
et al., 2010). Following transfection, medium was removed
and replaced with doxycycline-free medium containing 10%
FCS (Clontech). Doxycycline was then added at 1, 10 and
100 ng/ml. Medium and cells were harvested after 48 h and
enzyme levels in the medium measured by enzymatic colori-
metric assay (Morgan Elson reaction), n = 5, 3, 3 and 6 for 0,
1, 10 and 100 ng/ml, respectively, where n = individual well
normalized to the maximum activity in each plate.
Dox-i-ChABC gene therapy dual lentiviral vector

Lentiviral

(second
generation)
were
generated
as
described previously (Naldini et al., 1996; Hendriks et al.,
2007).
In
short,

were

by
co-transfection
of

vector
(pCMVdeltaR8.7.4)
and
the

plasmid
(pLV.TRE.ChABC or pLV.PGK.GARrtTA) into HEK293T
cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, lentiviral particles
were
harvested
from
the
medium
(Iscove’s
modified
Dulbecco’s medium supplemented with 2% FCS and 2 mM
GlutaMAX, Sigma Aldrich) by ultracentrifugation and the
viral particle-containing pellet was dissolved in phosphate-buf-
fered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). Lentiviruses were aliquoted and
stored at � 80�C until further use. Lentiviral stocks were
titred by infecting HEK293T cells in serial dilutions followed
by a quantitative PCR (qPCR) (using SYBR� Green, Applied
Biosystems) for the Woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcrip-
tional regulatory element (WPRE) to determine the number of
inserted viral genomic copies (GC) into the host cell genomic
DNA. WPRE qPCR primer sequences used forward: 50-

Study design
Assessing inducible gene expression with
dox-i-ChABC
To assess whether ChABC expression could be induced by
doxycycline administration and to compare the novel dox-i-
ChABC system with our previous constitutive ChABC gene
therapy system, negative control rats received a contusion
injury and either no treatment (contusion only; n = 2 for
qPCR), or dox-i-ChABC vector injection without doxycycline
administration (dox–; n = 3 for qPCR, n = 2 for histology).
Positive control rats received LV.PGK.ChABC vector injection
(n = 3 for qPCR, n = 2 for histology). Dox-i-ChABC treated
rats received dox-i-ChABC dual vector injections and were
administered doxycycline for 2.5 weeks (n = 3 for qPCR,
n = 2 for histology). All tissue was processed at 2.5 weeks
for evidence of ChABC gene expression at the mRNA level
and for histological evidence of digested CS-GAGs, see below.

evade recognition by T cells. (C) Expression of IFNg in tissue immediately rostral and caudal to the injury epicentre at 2.5 weeks following

[F(3,8) = 13.17, P = 0.0018, one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc]. (D) The expression of CD8b was upregulated by contusion injury and further
increased in the rtTA group, but not when the ChABC transgene was delivered with the ‘stealth’ GARrtTA gene switch [F(3,8) = 18.18, P = 0.006,
one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc], indicating differential immune response to these two regulated delivery systems. The immune-evasive
GARrtTA dox-inducible vector (dox-iChABC) was used throughout the remainder of the study.

was not increased by 1 ng/ml doxycycline administration. Application of 10 ng/ml doxycycline initiated the induction of ChABC gene expression
(43% � 4.4 U/ml), relative to maximal activity achieved by application of 100 ng/ml doxycycline (87% � 7.6 U/ml). (C) In vivo expression of the
ChABC gene is induced by dox-i-ChABC treatment to the same magnitude as LV.PGK.ChABC, measured by qPCR on extracted RNA from spinal
cord tissue at 2.5 weeks following contusion injury and intraspinal injection [F(3,7) = 27.13, P = 0.0003, one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s correction for
multiple comparisons]. (D) Translation and secretion of active enzyme was assessed by immunostaining for C-4-S in sagittal spinal cord sections
through the C5/6 lesion epicentre (top five rows) and at C3, C7, T10 and L3 at 2.5 weeks following contusion and intraspinal injection. Dox-i-
ChABC (left) induced intense C-4-S expression throughout the lesioned tissue, to a comparable magnitude to LV.PGK.ChABC (right). This
extended to spinal levels rostral (C3) and caudal (C7) to the lesion. At 2.5 weeks, little C-4-S is observed in thoracic (T10) or lumbar (L3) spinal
cord, with a small amount of basal ‘leaky’ expression detectable without doxycycline (middle), localized around the injection sites. Scale

 Sample sizes for biochemical quantitation are consistent with
prior data (Didangelos et al., 2014), and generated using [type
1 error threshold (�) 4 0.05 and power (1 � b) 5 0.80].
Assessing validity of on/off switch and efficacy of
long- versus short-term dox-i-ChABC after spinal
contusion injury
A long-term study was designed (Fig. 3) in which there were
four treatment groups following in vivo spinal contusion
injury: dox-i-ChABC dual vector injection and doxycycline ad-
ministration for 8 weeks (long-term dox-i-ChABC), dox-i-
ChABC dual vector injection and doxycycline administration
for 2.5 weeks (short-term dox-i-ChABC), dox-i-ChABC dual
vector injection without doxycycline administration (dox�)
and GFP vector injection and doxycycline administration for
8 weeks (GFP). ChABC gene expression was assessed by qPCR
at 2.5 weeks, 5 and 8 weeks (n = 3 per group per time point).
Animals were assessed weekly in behavioural tasks (n = 7, 7, 7
and 5 for long-term dox-i-ChABC, short-term dox-i-ChABC,
dox� and GFP, respectively). The present study had no a
priori expectation as to effect size, as dox-i-ChABC gene ther-
apy has not been used before in this context. To select sample
size, G*Power 3.17 was used to suggest a sample size of n = 7
per group would be sufficient to detect an effect size less than
that observed in a previous cervical contusion study using
LV.PGK.ChABC in the horizontal ladder task (James et al.,
2015),
accounting
for
differences
in
group
number
and
number of weeks of repeated assessments [type 1 error thresh-
old (�) 4 0.05 and power (1 � b) 5 0.80]. At the end of be-
havioural assessments, n = 4 per group underwent terminal
electrophysiological assessment of sensory axon conduction.
This sample size is consistent with previous studies (James
et al., 2011). Tissue from animals was subsequently taken
for histological analyses (methodology detailed below).
Blinding and randomization
For all animals used in behavioural studies the experimenter
performing analysis was blind to the treatment groups. During
Figure 3 Dox-i-ChABC study design. To validate the on/off switch over time and assess functional efficacy of long term versus short term
dox-i-ChABC, animals were randomly assigned to four treatment groups following pretraining in behavioural tasks and midline cervical 225 kdyn
contusion injury (dox administration is in green): (from top to bottom) Dox-i-ChABC vectors with doxycycline administration sustained for the 8
week duration of the study (long-term dox-i-ChABC); Dox-i-ChABC vectors with doxycycline administration for the first 2.5 weeks (short-term
dox-i-ChABC); Dox-i-ChABC vectors without doxycycline administration (dox�); and GFP vector injection with doxycycline administration
throughout (GFP), to control for broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. Additional animals were also included to assess ChABC gene expression at
different time points throughout the experiment (dotted lines). Terminal electrophysiology and histological assessments were performed after the
final behavioural time point.

 surgical procedures this was ensured by the experimenter in-
jecting the vectors being unaware of animal identification
number. Animals across the three groups receiving doxycycline
administration were randomized into cages, where an experi-
menter unaware of treatment group randomly assigned caging.
The dox� group were, by necessity, in the same cages initially,
since they were the only group not to receive doxycycline
chow; however, at the 2.5 week time point when doxycycline
was removed from the short-term dox-i-ChABC group, all ani-
mals were again randomized. Thus, blinding was maintained
as far as possible during data collection and all behaviour was
video recorded and analysed with the experimenter blind to
treatment. Electrophysiological assessments were also per-
formed with the experimenter blind to treatment.
Surgical procedures and treatment
Adult female Lister Hooded rats (n = 70) were given periopera-
tive analgesia (carprofen, CarprieveTM, 5 mg/kg, administered
subcutaneously) and anaesthetized (ketamine, 60 mg/kg, and
medetomidine,
0.25 mg/kg,
administered
intraperitoneally).
Skin was shaved and cleansed with sequential chlorohexidine
and iodine swabs. Overlying muscle was retracted and a dorsal
laminectomy of C6 vertebral process and half of C5 vertebral
process was performed. Periosteum was removed. Rats then
received a midline 225 kdyn spinal cord contusion injury at
level C5/6 using an Infinite Horizon impactor and 3-mm diam-
eter rounded impact tip (Precision Systems Instrumentation).
Immediately following injury, rats underwent midline intrasp-
inal injection of viral vectors at two sites, 1 mm rostral and
1 mm caudal to the injury, using a fine glass pulled-pipette and
microdrive
pump
(NanoLiter
2010
Injector/Micro
4
Controller, World Precision Instruments). The pipette was low-
ered 1.5 mm in the dorsoventral axis then retracted 0.5 mm
and vectors were injected at a rate of 200 nl/min. The pipette
was left in place for a further 2 min to ensure vector diffusion.
Viral vectors were injected at a volume of 1 ml per site
(LV.PGK.GARrtTA and LV.TRE.ChABC mixed in a 1:1
ratio;
n = 55)
or
0.5 ml
(LV.PGK.ChABC,
n = 5,
and
LV.PGK.GFP, n = 8). Following intraspinal injection, overlying
musculature was sutured in layers, skin was closed and anaes-
thesia was reversed (atipamezole hydrochloride, 1 mg/kg, ad-
ministered subcutaneously). Body temperature was maintained
at 37�C using a self-regulating heating mat throughout and
animals recovered for at least 1 h in an incubator (water
base thermostat 32�C, Thermocare) and were then returned
to home cages placed partially on heated mats overnight
(�35�C). For animals receiving doxycycline, this was adminis-
tered at a dose of �80 mg/day via custom chow (Envigo). In
the acute postoperative period following surgery, extensive
welfare checks were carried out, including provision of access-
ible chow and hydration gel in all cages. During this period
animals were housed in soft bedding and absorbent-lined cages
with less sawdust, to maximize ability to locomote, before re-
turning to standard husbandry conditions.
Assessing immune-evasive properties of the ‘stealth’
gene switch
To assess the immune-evasive properties of dox-i-ChABC, an
additional cohort of animals (n = 12) was prepared for com-
parisons of T cell-related gene expression in animals receiving
the dox-i-ChABC dual vector system compared to animals
with the same dual vector system without the immune-evasive
(GAR) component. Rats received a 225 kdyn contusion injury
at the C5/6 level, as described above, followed by intraspinal
injections 1 mm rostral and caudal to the lesion with 1 ml of
LV.PGK.rtTA and LV.TRE.ChABC (in a 1:1 ratio, working
titre
1010
GC/ml)
(n = 3)
or
LV.PGK.GARrtTA
and
LV.TRE.ChABC (in a 1:1 ratio, working titre 1010 GC/ml)
(n = 3), or received no intraspinal injection (contusion only,
n = 3). Animals injected with inducible vectors received daily
doxycycline (80 mg) for 2.5 weeks and were then deeply anaes-
thetized with sodium pentobarbital (Euthatal�, 80 mg/kg, ad-
ministered intraperitoneally) and transcardially perfused with
50 ml PBS supplemented with EDTA (12.5 mM). Two sections
of spinal cord rostral and caudal to the 8 mm injury epicentre
were rapidly dissected and frozen on dry ice and stored at
�80�C until processing. Tissue was thawed on ice and homo-
genized in 600 ml TRIzol� reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
An aqueous (RNA-containing) phase was generated using 1:10
bromo-chloro-propane, mixed 1:1 with 70% isopropanol and
centrifuged at 12 000 rpm to precipitate RNA. RNA samples
(3000 ng) were pooled in a 1:1 ratio from the rostral and
caudal samples and converted into cDNA using the high cap-
acity RNA-to-cDNATM kit (Applied Biosystems). Thirty nano-
grams of RNA per reaction was quantified using prevalidated
Taq Assays for interferon gamma (IFNg) and CD8b (Thermo
Fisher). GAPDH served as the housekeeping gene, using pre-
validated GAPDH primers (Roche). RT-qPCR (TaqManTM
assay) was performed using an automated cycler (Roche
LightCycler� 480 II) and mRNA expressed as ��Ct relative
to control tissue from uninjured rats (n = 3).
Behavioural functional assessments
Horizontal ladder
Prior to injury, animals were trained 15 min daily for 2 weeks
to cross a 1-m horizontal ladder with unevenly spaced rungs
and baseline values were obtained. Across the course of three
video-recorded runs along the ladder, total forelimb and hind-
limb steps were quantified and rated as successful or incorrect.
Steps were rated incorrect if the paw slipped from the rung
(partially or fully) or were non-weight bearing. This was ex-
pressed as a percentage of total steps. Following injury, ani-
mals were assessed weekly on this task. They were assessed in
chronological numerical order, which was independent and
unrelated to treatment group, during the morning.
Single pellet reaching: Whishaw window
Prior to injury, animals were trained 15 min daily for 2 weeks
to reach for sucrose pellets (Test Diet, Sandown Scientific),
with their dominant paw, through a window in a Plexiglas�
box. Pellets were placed in an indented well, retrieval from
which requires grasping and paw supination rather than drag-
ging of the pellet towards the mouth. During baseline and
testing, rats were offered 10 practice pellets and then 20
‘trial’ pellets which were scored from the dominant paw.
‘Hits’ (trials resulting in first-time pellet acquisition) were re-
corded and expressed as a percentage of ‘trials’ (Whishaw
et al., 2008). Rats were not trained to return to the back of
the testing arena each time as we wished to assess grasping
ability independently of any general locomotor deficit con-
found. For inclusion in assessment all rats achieved 465%

 pellet retrieval success at baseline. Sessions were video recorded
at 560 frames per second and rats were not food-restricted
prior
to
testing.
Following
injury,
animals
were
assessed
weekly. They were assessed in chronological numerical order,
which is independent and unrelated to treatment group, during
the morning. Rats were given any sugar pellets they failed to
retrieve after the task.
Manual 2D kinematic analysis of reaching and
grasping
A representative sample of rats were taken from the short and
long-term dox-i-ChABC treatment groups (n = 3 from each
group, the worst, median and best performers from prior ana-
lysis). Videos from the 8-week time point were split into single
frames and the middle proximal phalange position recorded in
sequential frames using a Manual Tracker plugin (Fiji). Traces
were smoothed via a single interpolation for graphical repre-
sentation. The y-coordinate, representing window opening,
was used to select x–y information as to paw location
during ‘grasp phase’. This is defined as having been initiated
when the paw passes through the window. Heat maps of rela-
tive paw position during this time were generated using the
NumPy
and
Matplotlib/Pyplot
histogram2d
function
in
Python 3.6. From these traces and known frame length, the
average length of time the rat took to successfully grasp the pel-
let was also calculated from onset of first passage of the paw
through the window opening to successful retrieval of that
pellet.
Analysis of ChABC gene expression by
quantitative PCR
Animals were deeply anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital
(Euthatal�,
80 mg/kg,
administered
intraperitoneally)
and
transcardially perfused with 50 ml PBS supplemented with
EDTA (12.5 mM). A section of spinal cord spanning injury
epicentre and injection site (�8 mm) was rapidly dissected
and frozen on dry ice and stored at �80�C until processing.
Tissue was thawed on ice and homogenized in 700 ml TRIzol�
reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). An aqueous (RNA-contain-
ing) phase was generated using 1:10 bromo-chloro-propane,
mixed 1:1 with 70% isopropanol and centrifuged at 12
000 rpm to precipitate RNA. RNA was converted to cDNA
using
the
high
capacity
RNA-to-cDNATM
kit
(Applied
Biosystems). Thirty nanograms of RNA per reaction was quan-
tified using primers generated against the modified ChABC
gene at a concentration of 100 nM (Forward: 50-AGAGC
CGTAGGCGTCTCTCT-30.
Reverse:
50-AGCGTTGAGGGT
CATCTCTC-30). GAPDH served as the housekeeping gene,
using
prevalidated
GAPDH
primers
(Roche).
RT-qPCR
(TaqManTM assay) was performed using an automated cycler
(Roche LightCycler� 480 II). The log fold change in mRNA
expression of ChABC was calculated from ��Ct values.
Immunohistochemistry
Animals were deeply anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital
(Euthatal�,
80 mg/kg,
administered
intraperitoneally)
and
transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformal-
dehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Tissue spanning the lesion
site (C5/6), plus C3/4, C7/C8, T10 and lumbar spinal cord was
dissected and post-fixed overnight, cryoprotected in 30% su-
crose, embedded and frozen in O.C.T. compound and then cut
into serial 20 mm transverse or sagittal sections using a cryo-
stat. To detect ChABC enzyme activity, immunohistochemistry
for the terminal non-reducing C-4-S product, indicative of
ChABC digestion of CS-GAGs, was performed (Barritt et al.,
2006). Briefly, mouse monoclonal anti-C-4-S (1:5000; MP
Biomedicals) immunohistochemistry was amplified using tyra-
mide signal amplification and detected using extra-avidin FITC
(1:500). Images were acquired at �20 using a Zeiss LSM710
confocal microscope. To assess excitatory glutamatergic in-
nervation, transverse C4/5 and C7/8 sections were immunos-
tained using a rabbit anti-vGlut1 antibody (1:500, Synaptic
Systems) and Alexa Fluor� 488 secondary antibody (1:1000,
Life
Technologies).
These
were
imaged
and
analysed as
described below. A further series of C4/5 and C7/8 sections
from
the
long-term
dox-i-ChABC
and
short-term
dox-i-
ChABC groups were double stained for vGlut1, as above,
and a neuronal marker (mouse monoclonal biotinylated anti-
NeuN 1:500 Millipore followed by extra avidin TRITC 1:500,
Sigma) for further examination of vGlut1 expression in these
two treatment groups. These images were acquired on a Zeiss
LSM10 confocal microscope at �40. To detect serotoninergic
fibres, transverse T2 sections were immunostained using rabbit
polyclonal
anti-5HT
(1:15
000;
ImmunoStar)
and
Alexa
Fluor� 488 secondary antibody (1:1000, Life Technologies)
and
imaged
at
�20
using
a
Zeiss
LSM710
confocal
microscope.
VGlut1 analysis
Transverse sections of C4/5 spinal cord were imaged at �10
on a Zeiss LSM10 confocal microscope and transverse sections
of C7/8 spinal cord were imaged at �10 on a Ziess Z1 wide-
field fluorescence microscope. Images were converted to 8-bit,
rigid orientation-registered to a spinal cord template section
corresponding to the appropriate spinal level by feature
mark-up, and batch processed using custom macros for thresh-
old and regional-specific mask application for spinal laminas I–
II, III–V and VI–X (Fiji). A pixel value threshold was assigned
as representative of positive immunostaining and maintained
across all analysis for C4/5 analysis and again for C7/8 ana-
lysis. Pixels above this threshold were summed and averaged
for laminas I–II, III–V and VI–X, across three sections per
animal in four to five animals per treatment group alongside
three uninjured controls. Averaged threshold grey matter data
per group were then converted to heat maps to display density
of vGlut1 + staining using NumPy and Matplotlib/Pyplot his-
togram2d function in Python 3.6.
5HT analysis
Three transverse sections per animal were imaged at �20 on a
Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope and regions of interest
applied over an area comprising the intermediolateral columns
and ventral horns. These regions were assigned a pixel thresh-
old representative of positive immunostaining that was main-
tained across all analysis, whereby pixels above this threshold
were summed and averaged across each animal (n = 3) in each
experimental group.

 Electrophysiology
At 8 weeks post-injury, terminal electrophysiological experi-
ments were performed to assess the conduction properties of
dorsal column sensory axons through the injury site (James
et al., 2015). Rats were deeply anaesthetized with urethane
(1.25 g/kg, administered intraperitoneally) and body tempera-
ture was maintained close to 37�C using a self-regulating
heated mat. A lumbar cord laminectomy was performed to
expose dorsal roots from L3–S1, followed by a separate cer-
vical exposure of the injury site to enable placement of stimu-
lating electrodes rostral and caudal to the injury. Following
both spinal cord exposures, the dura was removed and mineral
oil applied over CNS tissue. Filaments of dorsal roots L3–S1
on the left and right hand side, were teased using sharp forceps
and individually mounted on silver wire recording electrodes in
order to record �10 single-unit antidromic responses to a
stimulus of 0.2-ms duration square wave pulses at a frequency
of 1 Hz caudal to the lesion. Increasing stimulus amplitude (0–
800 mA) recruits sequentially more all-or-none unit responses,
whereby all action potentials in the filament were typically
present
by
400 mA.
The
stimulating
electrode
was
then
switched rostral to the lesion and the single units remaining
quantified and expressed as a percentage of those recruited
when stimulating caudal to the lesion.
Statistical analysis
Numerical values are reported as mean � standard error of the
mean (SEM). The experimental unit (n) is the rat. Parametric
statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics
24 or GraphPad Prism 7. Behavioural data were analysed by
two-way repeated measures analysis of covariance (RM-
ANCOVA), where baseline performance was a covariate.
Assumptions of ANCOVA, including normality, homogeneity
of error variances and sphericity were tested and satisfied.
Histological and electrophysiological data were analysed by
one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) or t-test. All statistics
and post hoc tests are stated in the text and correction for
multiple comparisons performed where appropriate. Error
bars are SEM unless stated.
Results
Addition of GAR peptide confers
immune evasive properties to the
inducible gene switch
Expression of IFNg (known to be predominantly produced
by T cells) and CD8b (a CD8 + T cell marker) was exam-
ined in tissue immediately rostral and caudal to the epi-
centre (the injury penumbra rather than epicentre was
examined because of the mass influx of immune cells at
the epicentre, which would likely mask any vector-related
changes) in animals receiving intraspinal injections of dox-
inducible vectors, which were designed with either a clas-
sical transactivator (rtTA) to activate gene expression upon
doxycycline administration (Fig. 1A), or an identical vector
design
except
for
the
addition
of
the
GAR
peptide
(GARrtTA), to create a ‘stealth’ gene switch designed to
evade the immune system (Fig. 1B). At 2.5 weeks following
injury and daily doxycycline treatment, a dramatic upregu-
lation of IFNg was observed in the classical reverse tetra-
cycline
controlled
transactivator
(rtTA)
group
in
comparison
with
all
other
groups
[F(3,8) = 13.17,
P = 0.0018, one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc; Fig 1C].
Moreover, while CD8b was found to be increased by con-
tusion only, it was further increased in the classical rtTA
group,
but
not
the
GARrtTA
group
[F(3,8) = 18.18,
P = 0.006, one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc; Fig. 1D].
These data indicate a differential immune response between
the classical rtTA and GARrTA dox-inducible ChABC
vector systems, with no IFNg response and no enhanced
CD8b response in the GARrTA group. Thus, we provide
an in vivo indication that our GAR peptide confers
immune-evasive properties to the inducible vector system.
In all subsequent studies, we used the GARrtTA stealth
system (termed dox-i-ChABC).
In vitro co-transfection of
PGK.GARrTA and TRE.ChABC
plasmids confers dox-sensitive
ChABC enzyme activity
We next sought to assess whether the PGK.GARrtTA and
TRE.ChABC constructs could be used to induce synthesis
of active ChABC enzyme in the presence of doxycycline
in vitro. HEK cells transfected with both plasmids were
treated with a range of concentrations of doxycycline for
48 h. Culture medium was then isolated and assessed for
ChABC
activity
via
colorimetric
(spectrophotometric)
assay. Without doxycycline administration, medium from
co-transfected cells had some low basal ChABC activity
(14% � 4.5 U/ml), which was not increased by 1 ng/ml
doxycycline administration. In contrast, application of
10 ng/ml doxycycline initiated the induction of ChABC
gene expression (43% � 4.4 U/ml), relative to maximal ac-
tivity achieved by application of 100 ng/ml doxycycline
(87% � 7.6 U/ml) (Fig. 2B). Thus, in vitro co-transfection
of dox-i-ChABC plasmids confer dox-sensitive expression
of active ChABC enzyme.
Doxycycline administration induces
expression and secretion of active
ChABC in vivo
We then sought to assess whether the dox-i-ChABC gene
therapy system could be used to deliver ChABC, in vivo, to
the
injured
spinal
cord.
LV.PGK.GARrtTA
and
LV.TRE.ChABC (Fig. 2A) were combined in equal ratio
and injected either side of a midline cervical contusion
injury at spinal level C5/6 and ChABC expression was as-
sessed after 2.5 weeks � doxycycline. In the presence of

 doxycycline, expression of the ChABC gene was success-
fully induced, to a similar magnitude as that in the positive
control (constitutive) LV.PGK.ChABC. LV.PGK.GARrtTA
and LV.TRE.ChABC co-injection without doxycycline ad-
ministration
resulted
in
very
low
gene
expression
[F(3,7) = 27.13, P = 0.0003, one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s
post hoc] (Fig. 2C). Translation of the ChABC gene and
secretion of active enzyme was confirmed by immunostain-
ing for C-4-S, a non-reducing epitope only exposed follow-
ing CS-GAG digestion by the ChABC enzyme. C-4-S
immunoreactivity in sagittal spinal cord sections through
the lesion epicentre revealed extensive matrix modification
by dox-i-ChABC (Fig. 2D, left), of a comparable magnitude
to that observed with LV.PGK.ChABC (Fig. 1D, right). The
pattern of intense C-4-S expression extended to spinal
levels rostral (C3) and caudal (C7) to the lesion. Little
matrix digestion was observed in distal segments of the
thoracic (T10) or lumbar (L3) spinal cord at this early
(2.5 week) time point. A small amount of C-4-S immunor-
eactivity was apparent in the spinal cord of dox� rats
(Fig. 2D, middle) in localized regions close to the injection
sites, revealing a low-level of ‘leaky’ transgene expression.
Thus, our dox-i-ChABC system enables doxycycline-sensi-
tive expression of active ChABC enzyme in vivo within the
injured mammalian spinal cord.
Dox-i-ChABC treatment can be
temporally regulated in vivo
Following confirmation that ChABC gene expression could
be induced in the injured spinal cord in the presence of
doxycycline, we then assessed whether gene expression
could be regulated by manipulating the period of doxycyc-
line exposure (validation of the on/off gene switch). QPCR
was used to measure ChABC mRNA expression in spinal
cord tissue at different post-injury time points after differ-
ent doxycycline regimes (Figs 3 and 4) revealing differential
ChABC gene expression [F(8,18) = 11.23, P 5 0.001, one-
way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc]. Relative to rats injected
with LV.PGK.GFP (which do not express ChABC as it is a
non-endogenous gene, and thus serve as negative controls),
at 2.5 weeks following dox-i-ChABC vector injection with
doxycycline administration ChABC expression was induced
[F(2,6) = 25.67, P = 0.0011, one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s
post hoc]. Without doxycycline administration (dox�)
there was a low level of ‘leaky’ transgene expression, and
this low level transgene expression without doxycycline
was apparent at all time points (Fig. 4). However, at 2.5
weeks the low level expression without doxycycline was
significantly (17-fold) less than ChABC gene expression
achieved with doxycycline administration (Fig. 4). At 5
weeks, following sustained administration of doxycycline,
ChABC gene expression was maintained [F(2,6) = 5.204,
P = 0.0489, one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc], whereas
removal of doxycycline at 2.5 weeks resulted in lower
transgene expression (not significant at this time point,
P = 0.1598). By 8 weeks ChABC expression decreased to
baseline levels following removal of doxycycline at 2.5
weeks, in contrast to sustained expression of ChABC
mRNA
with
maintained
doxycycline
administration
[F(2,6) = 15.87, P = 0.0040, one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s
post hoc] (Fig. 4). Thus, doxycycline administration and
removal allows temporal regulation of ChABC gene deliv-
ery following experimental spinal cord injury. This con-
firms the functionality of the dox-i-ChABC on/off gene
switch in vivo within the injured mammalian spinal cord.
Dox-i-ChABC treatment promotes
recovery of ladder walking
performance following cervical
contusion injury in adult rats
We next assessed the efficacy of dox-i-ChABC treatment in
promoting functional recovery following cervical spinal
Figure 4 Dox administration and removal allows temporal
regulation of ChABC gene expression in the injured spinal
cord. ChABC gene expression as measured by qPCR on RNA ex-
tracted from spinal cord injury tissue epicentre and injection site
following different periods of doxycycline (dox) exposure is regu-
lated by doxycycline. Low levels of ‘leaky’ transgene expression are
apparent at all time points following dox-i-ChABC vector injection
without doxycycline administration (dox�, grey data points). At 2.5
weeks, high ChABC gene expression is achieved with doxycycline
administration [F(2,6) = 25.67, P = 0.0011, one-way ANOVA,
Tukey’s post hoc]. At 5 weeks, following sustained administration of
doxycycline (red data points), ChABC gene expression is maintained
whereas removal of doxycycline at 2.5 weeks (yellow data points)
results in lower transgene expression [F(2,6) = 5.204, P = 0.0489,
one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc]. By 8 weeks, ChABC expression
has decreased to baseline levels following removal of doxycycline at
2.5 weeks (yellow data points), while high transgene levels are
maintained with sustained doxycycline administration (red data
points) [F(2,6) = 15.87, P = 0.0040, one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post
hoc] (dox� versus dox + !�, P = 0.7895; dox� versus dox + ,
P = 0.0096; dox + !� versus dox + , P = 0.0049).

 contusion injury and whether long term versus short term
treatment confers more benefit. Contusion device impact

of
equal
severity
across
treatment
groups
(Fig.

Assessment
of
forelimb
function
using
the
horizontal
ladder, a task requiring sensorimotor integration, revealed
improved performance following either dox-i-ChABC treat-
ment for 2.5 or 8 weeks, relative to controls (Fig. 5B).
While both dox� and GFP treated animals at 1 week
post-injury
made
81.0% � 7.9
and
81.0% � 9.3
footslips, respectively, those in dox-i-ChABC groups were
already
more
accurate
in
their
paw
placement,
making fewer slips (58.0% � 7.8 and 51.3% � 7.9 for
long-term
dox-i-ChABC
and
short-term
dox-i-ChABC,
respectively). This early effect was maintained into the
chronic post-injury time points, where there was a signifi-
cant effect of treatment over time. The long- and short-term
dox-i-ChABC groups made significantly fewer incorrect
steps than the dox� and GFP groups [F(3,21) = 6.875,
P = 0.02, two-way RM-ANCOVA, Bonferroni post hoc].
A trend for improvement with dox-i-ChABC treatment
was
observed
for
hindlimb
performance,
although
this
was
not
statistically
significant
[F(3,21) = 2.473,
P = 0.09, two-way RM-ANCOVA] (Fig. 5C). Thus, short-
term dox-i-ChABC treatment appears sufficient to induce
early
improvements
in
ladder
walking
performance,
with no greater improvement conferred by longer term
dox-i-ChABC.
Figure 5 Long- and short term dox-i-ChABC treatment promotes differential recovery following cervical contusion injury in
adult rats. (A) Contusion device impact force measurements did not differ between treatment groups, confirming consistent injuries across all
groups [F(3,22) = 0.9582, P = 0.4299, one-way ANOVA, n = 7, 7, 7, 5). (B) Assessment of forelimb function using the horizontal ladder task
revealed a significant improvement in performance following either long or short-term dox-i-ChABC treatment, relative to controls
[F(3,21) = 6.875, P = 0.02, two-way RM-ANCOVA, Bonferroni post hoc, n = 7, 7, 7, 5]. (C) No significant differences were observed in hindlimb
function on the horizontal ladder task [F(3,21) = 2.473, P = 0.09, two-way RM-ANCOVA, Bonferroni post hoc, n = 7, 7, 7, 5]. (D) Assessment of
skilled reaching using the Whishaw window showed that while all groups were severely impaired in reaching and grasping ability at early post-
injury time points, rats in the long-term dox-i-ChABC treatment group showed significant improvements in pellet reaching performance over
time, with recovery emerging around 5 weeks post-injury and continuing throughout the testing period, with significantly improved performance
in comparison to all other groups [F(3.17) = 9.643, P = 0.001, two-way RM-ANCOVA, Bonferroni post hoc]. (E) Manual kinematic tracing of paw
trajectory during assessment at the final 8 week time point. ‘Hits’ are coloured and successful pellet retrievals following more than one attempt
are grey. Heat maps show paw location in space during the grasp phase relative to the sugar pellet (white squares). Long term dox-i-ChABC
treated animals have a focused paw position in close proximity to the pellet during the grasping phase. Paw location of short-term dox-i-ChABC
animals is less focused and frequently further from (beyond) the pellet, reflecting a repetitive grasping motion before successful retrieval. (F) The
average time taken to successfully retrieve a pellet was significantly faster in long-term dox-i-ChABC animals compared to short term (t-test
P = 0.028, n = 3, 3).

 Sustained dox-i-ChABC treatment
promotes recovery of skilled reaching
following cervical contusion injury
We next assessed whether dox-i-ChABC could promote
recovery in a measure of skilled reaching and grasping.
Following pre-training, rats in all groups made a similar
number of ‘hits’ per ‘trial’ (successfully acquired pellets in
a single reaching movement) (Whishaw et al., 2008), which
dropped to zero in all groups one week following injury.
However, rats in the long-term dox-i-ChABC treatment
group continued to improve over time, with improvements
over all other treatment groups emerging around 4 weeks
post-injury
and
continuing
thereafter
[F(3.17) = 9.643,
P = 0.001, two-way RM-ANCOVA, Bonferroni post hoc;
Fig. 5D]. Pairwise comparisons collapsed across all time
points revealed not only a significant recovery in long-
term dox-i-ChABC treated rats relative to dox� and GFP
controls (P = 0.002, P = 0.001, respectively), but also signifi-
cantly greater improvement than the short-term dox-i-
ChABC treatment group (P = 0.033). Scores at Week 8
were
43.4% � 5.8,
19.2% � 5.7,
7.5% � 5.3
and
11.9% � 5.4 for long-term dox-i-ChABC, short-term dox-
i-ChABC,
dox�
and
GFP,
respectively
(Fig.
5D
and
Supplementary Videos 1–4).
To investigate this effect further, a representative sample
of animals from the two dox-i-ChABC groups were ana-
lysed at the final 8-week time point using manual kinematic
tracing. Reaches that led to successful pellet retrieval were
traced based on the position of the middle proximal phal-
ange of the paw. Figure 5E shows reaching and grasping
traces from each rat, where first time ‘hits’ are coloured
and successful pellet retrievals following more than one
attempt (‘pellets’; Whishaw et al., 2008) are grey (i.e.
more colour signifies greater skill and precision). This high-
lights that long-term dox-i-ChABC-treated animals more
accurately retrieved the pellet in fewer attempts. From
these traces, information as to paw location in space,
during the grasping phase, can be represented as a heat
map for each group, relative to the sugar pellet (white
square). Long term dox-i-ChABC treated animals have a
focused paw position in close proximity to the pellet
during grasping phase (Fig. 5E, bottom heatmap). In con-
trast, the paw position of short-term dox-i-ChABC treated
animals is spread and frequently further from (beyond) the
pellet, reflecting repetitive grasping motion before successful
retrieval (Fig. 5E, top heatmap). This represents an ongoing
deficit in the pronation and grasping phase of reaching fol-
lowing short term treatment, whereas long-term dox-i-
ChABC treated animals have recovered pronation, grasp-
ing, supination and ability to retrieve the pellet upon tar-
geted reach. This is additionally reflected by the average
time taken to successfully retrieve a pellet, where long-
term dox-i-ChABC treated animals successfully retrieved
the pellet almost three times faster than those in the
short-term
dox-i-ChABC
group
(0.16 � 0.02
and
0.45 � 0.08 s,
respectively,
t-test
P = 0.028)
(Fig.
5F).
Thus, only sustained dox-i-ChABC gene therapy (with
doxycycline administered for the full 8 weeks) promotes
recovery of skilled paw use and accurate grasping, indicat-
ing that long term CSPG digestion may be required for
significant neuroplasticity of descending systems involved
in skilled reaching.
Dox-i-ChABC treatment improves
conduction of ascending dorsal
column sensory axons through the
cervical contusion site
To assess physiological conduction properties of dorsal
column sensory axons traversing the contusion injury site
we
used
a
terminal
electrophysiological
preparation,
whereby single unit action potentials were recorded from
teased fine-filaments of lumbar roots after antidromic
stimulation rostral and caudal to the lesion (Fig. 6A).
Following the final behavioural time point, at 8 weeks
post-injury, both long-term and short-term dox-i-ChABC-
treated groups showed a significant improvement of sen-
sory fibre conduction, with an increased percentage of
axons able to conduct through the injury (70.4% � 2.3
and 69.3% � 4.4, respectively), compared to dox� and
GFP-treated controls (58% � 3.3 and 54% � 5.5, respect-
ively)
[F(3,12) = 3.961

P = 0.036,

ChABC treatment is sufficient to confer increased conduc-
tion of dorsal column sensory afferents, with no greater
improvement
conferred
by
longer-term
dox-i-ChABC
treatment.
Sustained dox-i-ChABC treatment is
associated with increased density and
distribution of vGlut1+ spinal
innervation
Following spinal cord injury, descending excitatory input is
severely disrupted. Since ChABC treatment has previously
been shown to promote neuroplasticity (Barritt et al., 2006;
Alilain et al., 2011; Starkey et al., 2012), we investigated
whether dox-i-ChABC treatment could alter the distribu-
tion and density of the presynaptic excitatory marker
vGlut1 in the spinal cord. Threshold analysis for vGlut1+
boutons, and heat maps representing their distribution in
grey matter at spinal levels C4/5 rostral to injury, revealed
that following injury there is a decrease and change in spa-
tial distribution of excitatory vGlut1+ fibres relative to con-
trol
uninjured

tissue
(Fig.

Regional
analysis to quantify vGlut1 expression in different spinal
lamina revealed a similar pattern of vGlut1 expression in
superficial lamina (I-II) in all animals, with no significant

 Discussion
Here we demonstrate a novel immune-evasive gene switch
that enables regulated delivery of ChABC in the injured
mammalian spinal cord. This provides an experimental
tool to control delivery (by effectively switching the gene
on and off) and understand the role of timing in ChABC
treatment, as well as a step towards creating a clinically
applicable viral vector system. Dox-i-ChABC effectively
mediates temporal control over CS-GAG removal, where
administration of doxycycline, a safe and widely used
pharmacological agent, induces high expression of the
ChABC gene and enables secretion of the active enzyme
and extensive matrix digestion. Removal of doxycycline
returns ChABC gene expression to baseline levels, with
some low ‘leaky’ transgene expression. We use this to
reveal that short-term ChABC gene therapy is sufficient
to replicate prior reported functional improvements and
find that long term administration elicits additional recov-
ery of skilled forelimb reaching and grasping behaviours
and this is associated with vGlut1 + fibre remodelling in
the spinal cord.

 Regulating ChABC gene delivery
This is the first demonstration of a regulated chondroiti-
nase gene therapy system in vivo. One previous attempt to
generate
Tet-On
chondroitinase,
using
an
adenoviral
vector encoding chondroitinase AC has been reported
and used in a human astrocytoma cell line (Curinga
et al., 2007) but this was not tested in vivo. Here, we
use a tetracycline derivative to induce expression of an
optimized ChABC transgene in order to exert temporal
control over enzyme delivery in vivo, in the mammalian
spinal cord, following a clinically-relevant cervical level
spinal contusion injury to adult rats. The ability to pre-
cisely control transgene expression is important, both for
extending the range of biological applications of viral
vector delivery and for advancing clinical development.
An ideal system would be able to stably maintain expres-
sion of a particular gene within the desired therapeutic
range but also allow gene expression to be turned off to
avoid potential side effects associated with long term de-
livery of some genes (Stieger et al., 2009). For example,
off target side effects such as aberrant sprouting and
weight loss have been reported with long term viral
vector
delivery
of
glial
cell
line-derived
neurotrophic
factor (GDNF) (Georgievska et al., 2002; Manfredsson
et al., 2009; Su et al., 2009) and may limit its effectiveness
for application to Parkinson’s disease and other disorders,
leading to efforts to develop inducible GDNF vector sys-
tems (Chtarto et al., 2016). Long-term viral delivery of
some therapeutic transgenes to the injured spinal cord
has also been reported to induce deleterious effects. For
example, BDNF delivered via AAV intraspinal injection to
cervical hemisected rats was shown to enhance axonal
growth, but was also associated with hyperreflexia and
spasticity, which was attributed to excitatory effects of
chronic BDNF over expression (Lu et al., 2012; Fouad
et al., 2013). Neuroplasticity effects of ChABC have
been widely demonstrated in numerous preclinical studies
and related to restored connectivity and recovery of many
functions (Pizzorusso et al., 2002; Garcia-Alias et al.,
2009;
Alilain
et
al.,
2011;
Wiersma
et
al.,
2017).
However, there is the possibility that long-term ChABC
overexpression could eventually lead to maladaptive remo-
delling. Although no negative effects have been docu-
mented thus far following ChABC delivery to the injured
or uninjured spinal cord, for example with measures of
pain thresholds showing no enhanced sensitivity (Barritt
et al., 2006; Galtrey et al., 2007; Karimi-Abdolrezaee
et al., 2010), even with sustained ChABC gene therapy
for up to 12 weeks (Bartus et al., 2014). Nevertheless,
clinical translation of ChABC will likely require a safe-
guard against potential aberrant plasticity.
In addition to improving clinical acceptability, the ability
to precisely modulate the period of ChABC administration
opens possibilities for exploring windows of neuroplasti-
city, which could be particularly potent if combined with
rehabilitation paradigms. The neuroplasticity afforded by
unmodified bacterial ChABC enzyme treatment adminis-
tered early post-injury has previously been shown to open
a window during which rehabilitation could promote upper
limb recovery, leading to improved manual dexterity in
skilled reaching tasks in dorsal hemisected rats (Garcia-
Alias et al., 2009). Controlled delivery with dox-i-ChABC
offers the opportunity to establish whether late stage win-
dows of neuroplasticity are possible in the chronically
injured spinal cord, as has recently been shown in experi-
mental models of chronic stroke where bacterial ChABC
enzyme injections dramatically potentiated the efficacy of
rehabilitative training (Wiersma et al., 2017), or indeed
whether multiple windows of neuroplasticity are possible.
Timing of intervention and training is also an important
issue that can be explored with dox-i-ChABC, as for
other neuroplasticity-inducing interventions such as anti-
Nogo immunotherapy where sequential (rather than con-
current) timing of the neuroplasticity intervention and the
rehabilitation protocol was shown to improve recovery
from experimental stroke and spinal cord injury (Wahl
et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2017). Furthermore, it is likely
that rehabilitation paradigms, which aim to consolidate
and strengthen correct connectivity, may benefit from
restoring appropriate neural stability following training by
switching off ChABC.
Thus, the ability to regulate ChABC transgene expression
represents a significant advance in exerting greater control
over neuroplasticity. The ability to modulate ChABC deliv-
ery could also have a range of applications other than in
the treatment of spinal cord injury. It may represent an
experimental tool in studies of developmental neurobiol-
ogy, learning and memory whereby ChABC-mediated deg-
radation of CSPG-rich perineuronal nets is known to
effectively reopen the critical period and re-enable induc-
tion of ocular dominance plasticity and the erasure of sub-
sequently acquired fear memories (Pizzorusso et al., 2002;
Gogolla et al., 2009). Temporary or repeated induction of
large-scale plasticity, or greater control over critical period
elongation could be achievable by using dox-i-ChABC in
these systems. Regulated ChABC delivery also has potential
wider applications for other preclinical models of CNS dis-
order and trauma. For example, ChABC bacterial enzyme
injection has been applied to experimental stroke models,
with observed increases in midline sprouting of corticosp-
inal tract axons and recovery of forelimb sensorimotor
function
(Soleman
et
al.,
2012)
and
tau
pathology
models, where restoration of memory was transiently
restored (Yang et al., 2015). These effects could poten-
tially be enhanced with longer term delivery, or with mul-
tiple treatment windows, using dox-i-ChABC. Furthermore,
the wider implications of developing an effective immune-
evasive
method
of
regulating
gene
expression
in
the
mammalian CNS may be expanded to other neurological
disorders with an autoimmune or inflammatory compo-
nent such as multiple sclerosis or amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis.

 T
et-regulated gene therapy in the
injured spinal cord
The current study represents the first use of an immune-
stealth gene therapy vector system to deliver a transgene to
the injured rodent spinal cord. It has been questioned
whether the ‘immune-privileged’ CNS could evade the
issue of rtTA recognition and removal of transduced cells
(Chtarto et al., 2016), observed following gene delivery to
the peripheral nervous system in rats (Markusic et al.,
2010) and primates (Favre et al., 2002; Latta-Mahieu
et al., 2002). However, injury to the spinal cord results
in non-resolving trauma-induced autoimmunity (Popovich
et al., 1996; Fleming et al., 2006; Ankeny and Popovich,
2009; Pruss et al., 2011). Thus, the potential for immune-
mediated removal of transduced cells in the aggressive in-
flammatory environment of the injured spinal cord is likely
to pose a problem for advancing Tet-regulated gene ther-
apy to the injured CNS. Following lesion to basal forebrain
cholinergic neurons, previous work has shown that Tet-Off
delivery of NGF can be achieved via ex vivo transduction
and transplantation of fibroblasts (Blesch et al., 2001) or
lentivirus injection, for 2 weeks (Blesch et al., 2005). In the
injured spinal cord, a further study demonstrated 6 weeks
of neurotrophin delivery via transplantation of fibroblasts
that were ex vivo transduced to express Tet-On BDNF
(Blesch and Tuszynski, 2007) and BDNF delivery up to 8
weeks following in vivo transduction distal to a lateral
hemisection injury and cellular transplantation site (Liu
et al., 2017). However, gene therapy treatments for spinal
cord injury using in vivo transduction via intraparenchymal
vector delivery in close proximity to a contusion site, where
the environment is one of aggressive inflammation, is more
likely to expose rtTA to antigen presenting cells. Indeed,
here we examined whether the addition of a ‘stealth’ gene
switch, which uses a chimeric transactivator fused with
GAR, could confer immune-evasive properties following
in
vivo
injection
into
the
contused
rat
spinal
cord.
Following intraspinal injection and 2.5 weeks of doxycyc-
line administration to activate gene expression, we found
no interferon response and no enhanced CD8b response
with the GARrTA dox-inducible ChABC vector system, in
contrast to the classical rtTA system. This provides evi-
dence that classical rtTA systems can elicit and/or exacer-
bate a T cell mediated immune response when injected into
an immune compromised spinal cord injury environment,
and that the stealth component of dox-i-ChABC can evade
T cell recognition, at least at this post-injury time point.
Furthermore, this is supported by recent work showing that
even in the uninjured spinal cord the classical rtTA system
is compromised over time (de Winter et al., in preparation).
A side by side comparison of rtTA and GARrtTA inducible
vectors driving luciferase gene expression (enabling long
term bioluminescence imaging) showed that rtTA-mediated
gene expression undergoes shutdown upon repeated induc-
tion in rats, whereas GARrtTA-mediated gene expression is
maintained; rtTA shutdown was associated with cell and
tissue damage, presumably due to immune cell activation
(de Winter et al., in preparation). These data, together with
the current findings, support previous in vitro findings,
which used a bioassay for human antigen presentation to
demonstrate that GAR protects rtTA from human cytotoxic
T cell mediated recognition, confirming that the chimeric
transactivator GARrtTA had an immune-evasive advantage
over classical rtTA (Hoyng et al., 2014) and support the
need for addition of an immune evasive component for
application of inducible vector systems to spinal cord
injury. The present demonstration that dox-i-ChABC gene
therapy both replicates and adds to our previous reported
functional improvements with a non-regulatable ChABC
vector (Bartus et al., 2014; James et al., 2015) together
with the demonstration that a vector system designed to
evade
the
immune
system
(Zaldumbide
et
al.,
2010;
Hoyng et al., 2014) has immune-stealth properties in vivo
in the injured mammalian spinal cord represents an import-
ant experimental advance in the use of regulated gene ther-
apy systems for spinal cord injury as well as a step towards
increasing clinical feasibility of ChABC gene therapy.
Dox-i-ChABC has low-level basal
‘leaky’ transgene expression
Some ChABC gene expression and enzyme activity was
detected
without
doxycycline
administration.
Although
these low levels of leaky gene expression did not appear
to have any biological effects, at least in terms of affecting
forelimb function and anatomical plasticity, it nevertheless
would be an advantage to eliminate residual leakiness from
the system. Although addition of GAR significantly im-
proves upon traditional rtTA systems in terms of reduction
in basal expression (Hoyng et al., 2014), it may prove
beneficial to further optimize the construct, using minimal
activation domains such as those found through screening
assays (Urlinger et al., 2000) or viral evolution (Zhou et al.,
2006). Furthermore, the TRE tetO sequences are also
amenable to modification to reduce background expression
and increase sensitivity (Loew et al., 2010; Roney et al.,
2016). Current efforts are ongoing to introduce these elem-
ents to enhance the robustness and translational potential
of the dox-i-ChABC system. In addition, because AAV-
based gene therapy has a well-established clinical safety
profile, efficacy of dox-i-ChABC within an AAV delivery
platform will be assessed. AAV-based gene therapy has
been approved for clinical use in the treatment of genetic
lipoprotein lipase deficiency (Gaudet et al., 2012) and in
the CNS, AAVs are the most commonly used vector in
clinical trials targeting tumours and neuronal disorders
(Choudhury et al., 2017). However, recent success with
lentiviral-mediated gene therapy for the treatment of cere-
bral adrenoleukodystrophy in children (Eichler et al., 2017)
also highlights the ongoing potential of lentivirus-based sys-
tems for clinical use.

 T
emporal and task dependence of
functional recovery
Here we found that both short term and long term ChABC
delivery with dox-i-ChABC promoted improved perform-
ance on the horizontal ladder task as well as enhanced
conduction of the ascending dorsal column projections.
These functions have previously been found to be highly
correlated (James et al., 2011) and both were shown to be
enhanced with our previous (non-regulated) ChABC gene
therapy system (Bartus et al., 2014; James et al., 2015),
where early improvements on the ladder were associated
with neuroprotection due to modulation of the inflamma-
tory response by large scale CSPG digestion (Bartus et al.,
2014). The finding that dox-i-ChABC treatment improved
both ladder performance and ascending neurotransmission
is an important confirmation that the new regulatable
system confers the same functional benefits as our previous
non-regulated vector. Furthermore, these data have provided
important information on timing, since it appears that short
term (2.5 weeks) treatment is sufficient to confer neuropro-
tective effects that are comparable to those observed with a
non-regulated ChABC vector. Finally, dox-i-ChABC also led
to an increase in descending serotonergic projections, again
confirming
previous
observations,
both
with
bacterial
ChABC enzyme (Barritt et al., 2006; Karimi-Abdolrezaee
et al., 2010; Alilain et al., 2011) and with non-regulated
ChABC gene therapy (Bartus et al., 2014).
In addition to replicating previous findings with a non-
regulated ChABC vector, we also wanted to assess efficacy
of dox-i-ChABC in a task which requires skilled reaching
and grasping performance and to determine the effect of
timing on these functions. It appears that short term
ChABC delivery is not sufficient to elicit recovery of skilled
motor performance, since only long-term dox-i-ChABC
treatment promoted significant recovery of skilled grasping
ability. The late stage emergence of recovery on this task
(improvements only began to emerge after 4 weeks) indi-
cates that recovery of skilled hand function was not attrib-
utable to neuroprotection, but more likely to be due to
neuroplasticity as a result of long term CS-GAG digestion.
Accordingly, these animals also had a greater density of
vGlut1+ innervation in the spinal cord rostral and caudal
to the injury. VGlut1+ populations of neurons in the spinal
cord constitute proprioceptive afferents synapsing on motor
neurons (Rotterman et al., 2014), corticospinal tract ter-
minals (Du Beau et al., 2012) and primary afferent fibres
(Alvarez et al., 2004). Feasibly, plasticity in any or all of
these populations could contribute to the observed recov-
ery, but density heat maps and regional specific analysis of
spinal cord lamina (split into lamina I–II, III–V and IV–X)
to
delineate
the
spatial
profile
of
plasticity
showed
increased immunoreactivity particularly in regions III–IV
both above and below the injury, areas likely to represent
grey matter innervation by the corticospinal tract. As the
corticospinal projection is associated with rodent success in
the Whishaw window reaching task (Whishaw et al.,
1993), it is possible that long-term treatment enables re-
organization and compensatory connectivity of this des-
cending
pathway.
Neuroplasticity
of
other
descending
systems may also be involved, for example dox-i-ChABC
may augment the natural capacity of reticulospinal tract
fibres derived from the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis
to form compensatory detour circuits with propriospinal
neurons (Filli et al., 2014). Future studies should character-
ize this further, with anatomical tract tracing of specific
spinal pathways since the corticospinal tract, or pathways
that can compensate for loss of its function, are of particu-
lar importance to human motor control and recovery of
these descending systems are thought to be important de-
terminants of independence following cervical spinal cord
injury (Wirth et al., 2008). Electrophysiological assessments
of descending transmission should also be evaluated in the
future, to evaluate conduction and connectivity in descend-
ing
motor
pathways
involved
in
skilled
reaching
performance.
Thus, our novel immune-evasive gene switch represents a
powerful experimental tool to temporally explore the ef-
fects of ChABC therapeutic treatment and an encouraging
step towards generating a more clinically-feasible ChABC
gene therapy strategy. Its use reveals temporally dependent,
task-specific, functional effects where short term adminis-
tration is sufficient to enable recovery of sensorimotor in-
tegration during walking and long term administration
confers additional benefit to skilled reaching and grasping
after cervical contusion injury. This preclinical study repre-
sents a significant advance since recovery of hand function
is the highest rated priority for improving functional out-
come in individuals with tetraplegia.
