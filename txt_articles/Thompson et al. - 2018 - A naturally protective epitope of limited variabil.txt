Current antigenic targets for influenza vaccine development are either highly immunogenic
epitopes of high variability or conserved epitopes of low immunogenicity. This requires
continuous update of the variable epitopes in the vaccine formulation or boosting of immunity
to invariant epitopes of low natural efficacy. Here we identify a highly immunogenic epitope
of limited variability in the head domain of the H1 haemagglutinin protein. We show that a
cohort of young children exhibit natural immunity to a set of historical influenza strains which
they could not have previously encountered and that this is partially mediated through the
epitope. Furthermore, vaccinating mice with these epitope conformations can induce
immunity to human H1N1 influenza strains that have circulated since 1918. The identification
of epitopes of limited variability offers a mechanism by which a universal influenza vaccine
can be created; these vaccines would also have the potential to protect against newly
emerging influenza strains.

easonal influenza is estimated to cause between 1 and 4
million cases of severe illness and 200,000 to 500,000 deaths
per year1. The best way to protect against influenza infec-
tion is through vaccination. Currently, a trivalent (TIV) or
quadravalent influenza (QIV) vaccine is given each year, targeting
the circulating H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A strains and one or
two lineages of the circulating influenza B strains. However, the
vaccine has to be formulated at least 6 months prior to the
influenza season and so the strains that are subsequently pre-
valent in the actual flu season do not always match the strains
used in the vaccine2.
The antigenic evolution of influenza is known to occur through
mutations in surface glycoproteins, principally haemagglutinin
(HA), allowing strains to escape the pre-existing host immunity3–
5. Epitopes within HA are commonly assumed to be either highly
variable due to strong immune selection (and typically located in
the head domain of HA) or conserved due to the absence of
immune selection (for example, in the stalk of HA)6. Together,
these form the backbone of the theory of antigenic drift, whereby
the virus population slowly and incrementally acquires mutations
in protective highly variable epitopes. However, the antigenic drift
model can only explain the epidemiology and limited genetic
diversity observed among influenza virus populations when very
specific constraints are placed on the mode and tempo of
mutation
or
by
invoking
short-term
strain-transcending
immunity7,8. An alternative model known as antigenic thrift
successfully models the epidemiology and genetic diversity of
influenza by assuming that immune responses against epitopes of
limited variability drive the antigenic evolution of influenza9–11.
Within this framework, new strains may be generated constantly
through mutation, but most of these cannot expand in the host
population due to pre-existing immune responses against epi-
topes of limited variability. This creates the conditions for the
sequential appearance of antigenically distinct strains and pro-
vides a solution to the long-standing conundrum of why the virus
population exhibits such limited antigenic and genetic diversity
within an influenza epidemic. An important translational cor-
ollary of this model is that a universal influenza vaccine may be
constructed by targeting such protective epitopes of limited
variability.
We show that studies of sera from young children taken in
2006/7 using neutralisation assays and ELISAs reveal a periodic
pattern of cross-reactivity to historical isolates consistent with the
recycling of epitopes of limited variability. We identify one epi-
tope of limited variability responsible for this pattern through a
structural bioinformatics analysis. We demonstrate that muta-
genesis of the epitope removes the cross-reactivity to historical
strains, and vaccination of mice with the 2006 conformation of
the epitope is able to reproduce the cross-reactivity pattern
identified in the serology studies. We further show that vacci-
nation of other epitope conformations induces similar but asyn-
chronous
cross-reactivity
to
historical
strains.
Finally,
we
demonstrate that vaccination with either the 2006 or 1977 epitope
conformations is able to protect the mice from the challenge with
a H1N1 influenza strain that last circulated in 1934. By estab-
lishing that the antigenic space within which influenza evolves is
much smaller than previously thought, we show that there are
epitopes in the major influenza antigen, HA, which if vaccinated
against would allow us to avoid the requirement for yearly
influenza vaccination necessitated by the current TIV and QIV
vaccines.
Results
Periodic cross-reactivity to historical isolates. We tested the
prediction that HA epitopes of limited variability exist by
performing microneutralisation assays using pseudotyped lenti-
viruses, displaying the H1 HA proteins from a panel of historical
influenza isolates (hereafter described as pMN assays12,13), with
sera obtained in 2006/2007 in the UK from 88 children born
between March 1994 and May 2000 (Fig. 1a). This panel con-
sisted of pseudotyped lentiviruses displaying HAs from seasonal
influenza strains as well as two pandemic strains: A/California/
04/2009 and A/South Carolina/1/1918. All individuals possessed
neutralising antibodies to the A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 strain,
and 98% of individuals possessed neutralising antibodies to A/
New Caledonia/20/1999. A total of 99% of individuals also pos-
sessed neutralising antibodies to the A/USSR/90/1977 strain,
while 30% of individuals also possessed neutralising antibodies to
the A/WSN/1933 strain. By contrast, only 3%, 9.1% and 3.4% of
individuals possessed antibodies to the A/California/4/2009, A/
PR/8/1934 and A/South Carolina/1/1918 strains, respectively.
ELISA analysis using the HA1 domain of the same seven strains
as an antigen was consistent with the pMN data and also iden-
tified broadly cross-reactive non-neutralising antibodies that bind
the HA1 region of various H1 influenza strains (Supplementary
Fig 1). These results are in agreement with a number of recent
studies suggesting that antibody responses showing some degree
of periodic cross-reactivity to historical strains14–22 counter to the
view of antigenic drift within which antigenic distance accumu-
lates linearly with time.
We
noted
that
the
A/Solomon
Islands/3/2006,
A/New
Caledonia/20/1999, A/PR/8/34 and A/WSN/33 HAs all contained
a deletion at position 147 (linear numbering, where Met = 1, H3
numbering: 133, WHO numbering: 130) and exhibited some
degree of reactivity to the 2006/2007 sera. This position otherwise
typically contains a positively charged arginine, in the case of the
A/USSR/90/1977 HA, or lysine, as is the case for the A/
California/4/2009 and A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 HAs. To deter-
mine whether the cross-reactivity observed between these strains
could be attributed to the deletion, a lysine was inserted at
position 147 (−147K) in the A/Solomon Islands/6/2006, A/PR/8/
1934 and A/WSN/1933 HAs (Fig. 1b–d). A statistically significant
loss of neutralisation for the −147K A/Solomon Islands/3/2006,
A/PR/8/1934 and A/WSN/1933 mutant pseudotyped lentiviruses
was observed (p-value = 0.0005, Fig. 1b, p-value = 0.0004, Fig. 1c
and p-value = 0.0056, Fig. 1d; p-values were determined using
Student’s t tests). In the case of the A/PR/8/1934 −147K mutant,
there was a total loss of neutralisation in four samples and a
reduction in two samples indicating that the bulk of cross-
reactivity between the A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 and the A/PR/
8/1934 strains is mediated through an epitope located in the
vicinity of the deletion (p-value = 0.0004 using Student’s t test,
Fig. 1c). Therefore, it seems that the absence of a positively
charged lysine at position 147 mediates much of the observed
cross-reactivity to historical strains induced by the 2006/2007
cohort sera in Fig. 1a.
Analysis of historical strain data shows that the deletion, the
only one to occur in the H1 HA, appears periodically over the
course to the antigenic evolution of H1N1 subtype of influenza
occurring in 1933, 1934, 1943, 1957 and between 1995 and 2008.
To ascertain whether the absence of an amino acid at position 147
would also mediate cross-reactivity with other historical strains
possessing the deletion, A/WSN/1933 neutralisation-positive
samples were run against the WT and −147K mutant A/Iowa/
1943 and A/Denver/1957 pseudotyped lentiviruses (Fig. 1e, f). A
statistically significant reduction in neutralisation was observed
for the −147K A/Iowa/1943 and A/Denver/1957 HA mutants (p-
value = 0.012, Fig. 1e, p-value = 0.011 using Student’s t test,
Fig. 1f). Furthermore, three samples, which neutralised the WT
A/Denver/1957 HA failed to neutralise the −147K mutant
entirely. These results imply that at least part of the cross-

 reactive neutralising immune response within this cohort is
mediated through the recognition of an epitope that contains a
deletion at position 147. Moreover, the existence of a lysine at
position 147 may contribute to the overall lack of neutralisation
of A/California/4/2009 and A/South Carolina/1/1918, in addition
to other variation across the HA.
Identification of an epitope of limited variability. Several pre-
vious studies have highlighted the importance of position 147.
Although not included within any of the canonical antigenic sites
defined by Caton et al.3 (being absent in the A/PR/8/1934 Mt.
Sinai strain), position 147 has recently been assigned to a new
antigenic site-denoted Pa in Matsuzaki et al.23, where it was
shown to be responsible for several A/Narita/1/2009 escape
mutants3,23. Position 147 is also important for the binding of
several known broadly neutralising antibodies: for example, the
5j8 antibody requires a lysine to be present at position 147, whilst
the CH65 antibody cannot bind if a lysine is present at position
14724,25. Furthermore, Li et al.18 demonstrated that certain
demographics, such as individuals born between 1983 and 1996,
possess antibodies that bind to an epitope containing a lysine
residue at position 14718.
We next employed a structural bioinformatic approach to
identify an epitope of limited variability that contained position

 147. In silico analysis was used to determine how the accessibility
and binding site area contributed to the variability of hypothetical
antibody binding sites (ABSs) (Fig. 2a) on the surface of the A/
Brevig Mission/1/1918, A/PR/8/1934, A/California/04/2009 and
A/Washington/5/2011 H1 HA crystal structures26–30. The ABS of
lowest variability containing position 147 was consistently
represented by the site shown in Fig. 2b31 and could be shown
to locate to an exposed loop in the head domain of the H1 HA,
not
covered
by
N-linked
glycosylation
(Fig.
2b,
c),
and
encompassing additional residues in the Ca2 antigenic site.
Analysis of this site (hereafter called OREO) suggested that
various conformational epitope variants could be defined on the
basis of variation and structural proximity of positions 147, 158
and 159. Combining these analyses with the site-directed
mutagenesis SDM results, we arrived at a maximum of five
epitope conformations of the epitope (Fig. 3 and Supplementary
Fig 3), which arise and disappear in a cyclical manner during the
known evolutionary history of the pre-pandemic and post-
pandemic H1N1 lineages (Fig. 2d). This analysis demonstrates
that there are numerous potential sites of limited variability in the
head domain of the H1 HA represented by the local minima in
Fig. 2a, in addition to a range of highly variable sites; the antigenic
trajectory of the latter has been tracked in detail by several
previous studies32,33.
Vaccination induces cross-reactivity to historical isolates. We
next substituted the five proposed conformations of OREO (Fig. 3
and Supplementary Table 1) into H5, H6 and H11 HAs, which
have not circulated in the human population, to maintain the
conformations of the epitope and allow the immune response to
be focused on the epitope via a prime–boost–boost vaccination
regimen (Fig. 4a). Consequently, mice were vaccinated using a
DNA–DNA-pseudotyped lentivirus regimen alternating between
different HA scaffolds (Fig. 4a). Analysis of sera obtained from
the final bleed at 21 weeks prior to the influenza challenge
demonstrated that vaccinating with these epitopes produces
antibodies that are cross-reactive to a number of historical strains.
Notably, the 2006-like epitope conformation (red) produces
cross-reactive antibodies that mirror the neutralisation profile of
sera taken in 2006/2007 from young children aged 6–12 years
(Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig 1): both datasets show neu-
tralisation of pseudotyped lentiviruses displaying HAs from A/
Solomon Islands/3/2006, A/USSR/90/1977, A/PR/8/1934 and A/
WSN/1933 via the OREO epitope, but not from A/California/4/
2009 or A/South Carolina/1/1918 (Fig. 4b–g). Intriguingly, the
1977-like conformation (green) containing an arginine at position
147 also displays similar cross-reactivity to that of the 2006-like
epitope (red), containing a deletion at position 147. Furthermore,
the 2009-like (blue) and 1991-like (orange) conformations
showed periodic cross-reactivity to historical strains demon-
strating the chronological reoccurrence of epitopes of limited
variability (Fig. 4b–g).
Vaccination protects against heterologous challenge. To test
whether antibodies directed against these epitopes conferred
protective immunity, the 2006-like (red) and 1977-like (green)
epitope-vaccinated groups were challenged with a strain collected
in 1934 (A/PR/8/1934) (Fig. 5a, c). The 2009-like (blue), 1995-like
(orange) and 1940-like (pink) groups were challenged with a 2009
pandemic strain (A/California/04/2009; Fig. 5b, d). In each
challenge experiment, an unvaccinated group (n = 6) was inclu-
ded as well as a group vaccinated via the DNA–DNA-pseudo-
typed lentivirus regimen with the H6, H5 and H11 HAs without
the substituted epitope conformations (n = 6). Vaccination with
the 2006-like (red) and 1977-like (green) epitope conformations
conferred immunity to challenge with the A/PR/8/1934 virus
(Fig. 5a, c). As expected, vaccination with the 2009-like epitope
also conferred immunity to challenge with A/California/04/
2009 strain, which last circulated in 2009 (Fig. 5b, d). These
results demonstrate that epitopes that circulated in the A/Solo-
mon Islands/8/2006 and A/USSR/90/1977 strains, which last
circulated in 2006 and 1977, respectively, were able to produce
antibodies that confer protection against challenge with the A/
PR/8/1934 strain, which last circulated in 1934.
Discussion
Our results demonstrate the existence of a highly immunogenic
epitope of limited variability in the head domain of the H1 HA,
which has been theorised by mathematical modelling studies to
drive the antigenic evolution of influenza9,10. Sera from children
aged 6–12 years taken in 2006/7 were shown to cross-react with a
panel of historical isolates, the majority of which they will not
have experienced (Fig. 1a). This cross-reactivity was removed by
mutagenesis of an epitope of limited variability identified through
a structural bioinformatic analysis (Fig.1b–f and Fig. 2). We were
further able to reproduce the cross-reactivity exhibited in the
serology studies in a mouse model, and demonstrated that vac-
cination with the epitope conformations circulating in 2006 or
1977 induced protective immunity to challenge with a strain that
last circulated in 1934 (Fig. 4). Vaccination with other con-
formations of the epitope produced complementary but asyn-
chronous cross-reactivity to historical strains (Figs. 4 and 5).
Furthermore, between 1918 and the present day, the 2006-like
147-deleted conformation of the epitope has occurred 5 times. In
two instances, when circulating strains contained the 147-deleted
conformation
of
the
epitope,
lineage
replacement
of
the
H1N1 strain occurred (in 1957 and 2008). This suggests that the
possession of a conformation of the epitope in which 147 is
present conferred a very significant selective advantage once
population immunity has built up against the 147-deleted
conformation.
Another site of limited variability identified by our analysis in
the head domain of the H1 HA appears to be centred on position
180 (linear numbering, position 166: H3 numbering, position
163: WHO numbering). Linderman et al19. and Huang et al20.
have identified and purified antibodies that bind to a site
including position 180 and neutralise A/California/04/2009, A/
USSR/07/1977 and A/Brevig Mission/1/1918, but not A/Solomon
Islands/30/2006, A/New Caledonia//1999 and A/PR/8/1934, dis-
playing cyclical cross-reactivity in a similar but asynchronous
manner to OREO19,20,22. However, as this site is periodically
covered by glycosylation, the OREO epitope is likely to be a better
vaccine target.
Currently available influenza vaccines are believed to target
epitopes of very high variability on the haemagglutinin and
neuraminidase surface glycoproteins. This requires them to be
continuously updated, with the only alternative being seen as the
artificial boosting of immunity to conserved epitopes of low
immunogenicity. By identifying such epitopes, we have estab-
lished an alternate method of producing improved influenza
vaccines: targeting highly immunogenic epitopes of limited
variability as opposed to targeting highly immunogenic epitopes
of high variability or conserved epitopes of low immunogenicity.
Through vaccination against the various conformations of the
epitope of limited variability identified in this study, it is possible
to induce immunity to all previous and future H1N1 strains.
The OREO site has been under selective pressure over a period
of 80 years, providing us the opportunity to observe and docu-
ment its variation: the site has historically cycled between four
conformations

 conformation where it has undergone a deletion. Once the
deletion has occurred, instead of the epitope varying further, on
two occasions the circulating seasonal H1N1 strain died out—
once in 1957 and again in 2009. In 2009, the seasonal influenza
strain was replaced through zoonotic spillover with a pandemic
H1N1 strain displaying a previously seen conformation of OREO,
to which immunity in 2009 has not yet built up against34,35. In
1957, the seasonal influenza strain was replaced with H2N2
influenza (Fig. 2d)36. These observations suggest that the anti-
bodies generated against these five conformations cover all pos-
sible variations within the OREO epitope that are found in
evolutionary fit H1N1 influenza viruses.
This limited variation exhibited by the epitope is determined
by the composition of the site. Position 147 is next to, and
affects the polarity of, the receptor binding site, and therefore
there is a limited repertoire of amino acids it can cycle between.
Furthermore, the OREO site is composed of a smaller number of
residues compared with other sites containing position 147,
which intrinsically limits its overall variability (Supplementary
Fig 4a, b).
All the conformations of the OREO epitope could be displayed
in a single vaccine by itself or in concert with other epitopes of
limited variability to create a single universal influenza vaccine.
Alternatively, the epitopes could be displayed in individual vac-
cines and deployed when the circulating conformation changes
(currently the OREO epitope changes roughly every 10 years, see
Supplementary Fig 3). The critical feature of both approaches
described above is that the OREO epitope does not drift to the
same level as the currently targeted highly variable epitopes.
Hence, both of these approaches could provide longer-lasting
vaccines in comparison to the trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines.
Moreover, the longer cycling period of OREO might help
decrease and also avoid mistakes in the formation of the vaccines,
which sometimes occur due to formulation decisions having to be
made at least 6 months prior to the influenza season2.
The evolutionary framework on which these studies are
based9,37 applies generally to other subtypes of influenza A such
as H3N237 and also to influenza B, suggesting that epitopes of
limited variability can also be identified in these viruses. Indeed,
Zinder et al.37 have shown that the phylodynamics of H3N2
influenza is easily reproduced using the antigenic thrift frame-
work. Consequently, the same strategy could be used to produce
vaccines for other subtypes of human influenza, as well as swine
and avian influenza viruses and potentially other viruses.
Methods
Serum samples. A total of 88 serum samples from young children aged 6 to 12
years were collected in Oxford in 2006/2007. The legal guardians of all donors gave
written informed consent for research use of blood samples with ethical approval
by a local research ethics committee, South Central– Hampshire B Research Ethics
Committee (ref: 16/SC/0141). Further permission for the use of the samples in this
specific study was also granted by the Oxford Vaccine Centre Biobank.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anti-HA1 antibody responses
were measured using ELISAs. In brief, Nunc-Immuno 96-well plates (Thermo
Fischer Scientific, USA) were coated with 1.0 μg ml−1 of HA1 protein (Sino Bio-
logical Ltd, China) in PBS buffer and left overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed with
6x with PBS–Tween PBS/T, then blocked with casein in PBS for 1 hour at room
temperature. Serum or plasma was diluted in casein–PBS solution at dilutions
ranging from 1:50 to 1:1000 before being added to Nunc-Immuno 96-well plates in
triplicate. Plates were incubated at 4 °C overnight before being washed with 6x with
PBS–Tween PBS/T. Secondary antibody rabbit anti-human whole IgG conjugated
to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma, USA) was added at a dilution of 1:3000 in
casein–PBS solution and incubated for 1.5 hours at room temperature. After a final
wash, plates were developed by adding 4-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate in die-
thanolamine buffer (Pierce, Loughborough, UK), and optical density OD was read
at 405 nm using an ELx800 microplate reader (Cole Parmer, London, UK). A
reference standard comprising of pooled cross-reactive serum and naïve serum on
each plate served as positive and negative controls, respectively.
The positive reference standard was used on each plate to produce a standard
curve. The standard was made from cross-reactive serum against each HA1
protein. It was added in duplicate at an initial dilution of 1:100 in casein–PBS
solution and diluted twofold 10 times, starting with an arbitrary value of antibody
units determined using the NIH standard calculator38. Three blank wells
containing casein–PBS solution only and further three blank wells containing naïve
human sera or plasma were used as negative controls. The mean of the OD values
of the naïve sera was then subtracted from all OD values on each plate before
triplicates were fitted to a four-parameter standard curve using the positive
reference standard38. At least two technical replicates were performed to ensure
reproducibility.
Pseudotyped influenza virus production. Pseudotyped lentiviruses displaying
influenza HAs were produced by transfection of HEK 293 T/17 cells (ECCAC,
Public Health England, UK) with 1.0 μg of gag/pol construct, p8.91, 1.5 μg of a
luciferase reporter carrying construct, pCSFLW, 250 μg of TMPRSS4-expressing
construct and 1.0 μg of HA glycoprotein-expressing construct12. Transfections
were performed in 10 ml of media DMEM 10% FCS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin,
20% L-glutamate and left for 8 hours. One unit of endogenous NA (Sigma, USA)
was added to 10 ml of new media to induce virus budding. Media was removed 48
hours post the induction of budding and filtered with a 0.45-μm syringe. The
pseudotyped influenza viruses were stored at −80 °C.
The strain accession numbers used for production of the pseudotyped
lentiviruses are A/California/04/2009 (AEE69009), A/Solomon Islands/3/2006
(ABU99109), A/USSR/90/1977 (AAA43240), A/Denver/1957 (ABD15258), A/
Iowa/1943 (ABO38373), A/PR/8/1934 (CCH23213), A/WSN/1933 (ACF54598)
and A/South Carolina/1/1918 (AAC57065).
The p8.91, pCSFLW and TMPRSS4-expressing construct were gifts from Dr
Nigel Temperton, whilst the HA-expressing plasmids were either gifts from Dr.
Temperton or produced through the cloning of GeneArt Strings (Thermo Fischer
Scientific, USA) into the pI.18 expression vector (also a gift from Dr. Temperton).
All plasmids are available on request.

 Pseudotyped influenza virus titration. Serial dilutions were made of pseudotyped
influenza virus preparations in Corning Costar plates 96-well plates (Promega,
USA). A total of 104 HEK 293 T/17 cells were added to each well and incubated for
3 days at 37 °C. The cells were then lysed with BrightGlo reagent (Promega, USA),
and the relative light units of the cell lysate were determined using a Varioscan
luminometer microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).
Pseudotype microneutralisation assay. Neutralising antibodies were quantified
using a pseudotype microneutralisation assay. Serially diluted sera was added to
Corning Costar plates 96-well plates (Promega, USA) before being incubated with
106 RLU-pseudotyped influenza virus for 1 hour at 37 °C. Each dilution was made
in duplicate. A total of 2 μl of sera were used per replicate in Fig. 1a. For
comparison of WT and SDM-pseudotyped influenza viruses, 10 μl of sera was used
per replicate in Fig. 1b–f. A total of 1 ul of sera per replicate was used in the
vaccination experiment shown in Fig. 4 due to the small amounts of blood collected
from the mice. HEK 293 T/17 cells 2.0*10^5 cells ml−1 were subsequently added to
each well and incubated for 3 days at 37 °C. The cells were lysed with BrightGlo
reagent (Promega), and the relative light units of the cell lysate were determined
using a Varioscan luminometer microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).
The reduction of infectivity was determined by comparing the RLU in the presence
and absence of antibodies and expressed as percentage neutralisation. The 50%-
inhibitory dose, IC50, was defined as the sample concentration at which RLU were
reduced 50% compared with virus control wells after subtraction of background
RLU in cell-only control wells. At least two technical replicates were performed for
each biological sample to ensure replicability.

 The C179 antibody used as a control in Fig. 1 b–f was obtained from Takara
Bioscience (Product code: SD3145)
Structural bioinformatic analysis. Amino acids present on the surface of various
H1 HAs were determined by calculating the accessibility of amino acids on the
surface of the crystal structures of A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (1RUZ26 [https://www.
rcsb.org/structure/1ruz]), A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (1RU726 [https://www.rcsb.org/
structure/1ru7]), A/California/4/2009 (3LZG28 [https://www.rcsb.org/structure/
3lzg]) and A/Washington/5/2011 (4LXV29 [https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4LXV])
HAs using Swiss-Pdb viewer. Areas of 600, 800 and 1000 Å2 were mapped onto the
surface of the crystal structures by determining the distances between the α carbon
of a given amino acid and all others within a structure. Those residues whose α
carbon sequences were within the specified area were recorded and used to produce
disrupted peptide sequences for a given binding site. ABS variability was calculated
as the mean pairwise hamming distance between the consensus sequences collected
between 1918 and 2016. The sequences were aligned using MUSCLE before being
manually curated using AliView.
Vaccination of mice. Animal studies were approved by the University of Oxford
Ethical Review Committee and were performed in strict accordance with the terms
of a licence granted by the UK Home Office under the Animal (Scientific Proce-
dures) Act 1986 (licence number: 30/2889).
Female BALB/c mice, n = 6, (bought from Envigo, UK) were sequentially
vaccinated with the OREO sequences substituted into H6, H5 and H11 HA
backbones in a prime–boost–boost regime at intervals of 3–4 weeks. As a backbone
control, two groups were vaccinated with native H6, H5 and H11 constructs.
Further two groups were mock vaccinated and used as an unvaccinated control.
The prime and first boost were administered as a 100-µg intramuscular injection of
DNA into the musculus tibialis, whilst the final vaccination was administered as an
intramuscular injection into the musculus tibialis of eight HI units of lentivirus
pseudotype displaying the chimeric H11 HA in Alum adjuvant Alhydrogel
(Invitrogen, USA) at a 1:1 volume ratio.
Individuals carrying out the mouse vaccination experiments were blinded
regarding the vaccines being administered to the mice; vaccines and cages were
numbered and administered as outlined above. The individuals carrying out the
experiments were only notified of the vaccine identities after completion of the
experiment. No exclusion criteria were applied to the mice and no randomisation
was applied to the experiments as inbred mice were used.
Haemagglutinin inhibition assay. Pseudotyped lentivirus displaying influenza HA
was diluted twofold down a 96-well plate and mixed with 50 µl of 4% chicken red
blood cells. After an hour, the coagulation of red blood cells was assessed visually to
determine the point at which coagulation could no longer be observed.
Influenza challenge. At 5 weeks post final boost, mice were challenged intranasally
with either A/PR/8/1934 at 1.0 × 103 PFU per mouse or A/California/04/2009 at
1.5 × 105 PFU per mouse. Mice were weighed daily. At 3 days post-challenge, food
in proportion to the number of mice in each cage was placed on the floor of the
cage. Mice were euthanised at their pre-determined humane endpoint of 20%
weight loss or if they showed no sign of recovery at 7 days post-challenge. Group
sizes were determined using a power calculation based on data from the previous
studies38.

 Statistical analysis. Student’s t tests were performed to determine all p-values
shown in Fig. 1.
Area under the curve was calculated for the mouse weight loss data (Fig. 5a and
c, main text) and analysed in a single-factor ANOVA. Between-group comparisons
were then performed using Tukey’s post hoc method for pairwise comparison
correction to provide the corrected p-values.
Fisher’s exact test was used to determine survival differences in the
experimental groups after 7 days (Fig. 5b and d). All p-values were adjusted to
multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni–Holm correction.
Phylogenetic analysis. RAxML version 8.2.11 was used to build a maximum
likelihood tree based on the strain HA amino acid sequences, using a gamma
distributed site heterogeneity model and the amino acid FLU substitution model.
Tip-to-root distance was regressed against sequence dates, using a best fitting root,
in Tempest V1.5.1. This yielded an R-squared of 0.886 and 0.834 for the ≤ 2008 and
≥ 2009 data, respectively, indicating a good fit between the genetic distance and the
time of sampling. The colour of branches was determined by the identification of
amino acids at positions 147 and 158, which are the variable amino acids at the
centre of the amino acid binding site. Blue OREO was defined as position 147 as
lysine and position 158 as no lysine; orange OREO as position 147 as lysine and
position 158 as lysine; green OREO was defined as position 147 as arginine; red
OREO was defined as position 147 as a deletion; pink OREO was defined as
position 147 as isoleucine.

Competing interests: C.P.T and S.G are named as inventors on a patent application for
an influenza vaccine targeting the epitope conformations outlined in this paper (PCT/
GB2017/052510). It should be noted in the interests of full disclosure that S.C.G is a co-
founder of Vaccitech, a spin-out company from the University of Oxford, which is
developing an MVA-NP + M1 influenza vaccine. However, the MVA-NP + M1 vaccine
as well as Vaccitech are entirely separate from and in no way are connected to the work
undertaken in this paper as well as the vaccine proposed in the paper. All other authors
report no potential conflicts.
