 SUMMARY
Mitochondrial acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) regulates pyruvate dehydrogenase 
complex (PDC) by acetylating pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and PDH phosphatase. How 
ACAT1 is “hijacked” to contribute to the Warburg effect in human cancer remains unclear. We 
found that active, tetrameric ACAT1 is commonly upregulated in cells stimulated by EGF and in 
diverse human cancer cells, where ACAT1 tetramers but not monomers are phosphorylated and 
stabilized by enhanced Y407-phosphorylation. Moreover, we identified arecoline hydrobromide 
(AH) as a covalent ACAT1 inhibitor, which binds to and disrupts only ACAT1 tetramers. The 
resultant AH-bound ACAT1 monomers cannot reform tetramers. Inhibition of tetrameric ACAT1 
by abolishing Y407-phosphorylation or AH treatment results in decreased ACAT1 activity, leading 
to increased PDC flux and oxidative phosphorylation with attenuated cancer cell proliferation and 
tumor growth. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of how oncogenic events signal 
through distinct acetyltransferases to regulate cancer metabolism, and suggest ACAT1 as an anti-
cancer target.
Graphical Abstract
INTRODUCTION
Cyclic acetylation/deacetylation plays a key role in regulation of many essential proteins that 
are involved in diverse cellular processes including cell survival, proliferation, chromatin 
remodeling and metabolism (Choudhary et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2010). Recent studies 
revealed that metabolic enzymes including pyruvate kinase M2 isoform, lactate 
dehydrogenase A and lysine acetylation of ATP-citrate lyase are regulated by lysine 
acetylation, providing insights into a mechanistic link between cell signaling pathways and 
metabolic pathways in cancer cells (Hitosugi and Chen, 2014; Lin et al., 2013; Lv et al., 
2011; Zhao et al., 2013). We reported that commonly upregulated acetylation at K76 and 
K294 of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) promotes NADP+-binding to 6PGD 
and formation of active 6PGD dimers, respectively. Moreover, we identified DLAT and

 ACAT2 as upstream acetyltransferases of K76 and K294, respectively, and HDAC4 as the 
deacetylase of both sites. Inhibition of 6PGD by expressing acetyl-deficient mutants of 
6PGD or treatment with 6PGD inhibitors Physcion or its derivative S3 in cancer cells 
significantly attenuated cell proliferation and tumor growth (Lin et al., 2015a; Shan et al., 
2014). However, how oncogenic events signal through distinct acetyltransferases and 
deacetylases to regulate metabolic enzymes via cyclic acetylation/deacetylation remains 
unknown, and metabolism-related protein acetyltransferases and deacetylases as potential 
anti-cancer targets remain unexplored to date.
The metabolic switch from OXPHOS to glycolysis is partially achieved through 
upregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase (PDHK) activity by c-Myc and 
HIF-1α, which phosphorylates and inactivates mitochondrial PDH, leading to attenuated 
pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) flux in cancer cells (Kim and Dang, 2006; 
Papandreou et al., 2006). In addition, we found that lysine acetylation-dependent inhibition 
of PDH and PDH phosphatase (PDP) is common in EGF-stimulated cells and diverse human 
cancer cells, contributing to PDC attenuation and consequently promoting cancer cell 
proliferation and tumor growth. We identified mitochondrial acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 
(ACAT1) and SIRT3 as upstream acetyltransferase and deacetylase, respectively, of PDHA1 
and PDP1 (Fan et al., 2014). Active ACAT1 is a tetrameric enzyme in ketogenesis that 
converts two acetyl-CoA molecules to acetoacetyl-CoA and CoA (Balasse and Fery, 1989; 
Haapalainen et al., 2007; Haapalainen et al., 2006). We reported ACAT1 as a mitochondrial 
protein acetyltransferase and most importantly, stable knockdown of ACAT1 attenuates 
tumor growth (Fan et al., 2014). However, how ACAT1 is “hijacked” to contribute to the 
Warburg effect in human cancer remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated upregulated 
Y407 phosphorylation activates ACAT1 by stabilizing tetrameric ACAT1 proteins in cancer 
cells and validated arecoline hydrobromide (AH) as a tetrameric n ACAT1 in treatment of 
human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS
Activation of ACAT1 by EGF stimulation and diverse tyrosine kinases involves tyrosine 
phosphorylation and tetramer formation
We found that the enzyme activity of ACAT1 is commonly upregulated in diverse human 
leukemia, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, and prostate cancer cells compared to 
corresponding control cells that are normal human proliferating cells with same tissue 
origins, despite comparable protein expression levels of ACAT1 (Figure 1A). In addition, we 
found that ACAT1 enzyme activity levels are also commonly upregulated in human primary 
leukemia cells from diverse acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia 
(CML), B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), and acute promyelocytic leukemia 
(APL) patients (n=22), compared to control peripheral blood cells from healthy donors (n=4) 
(Figure 1B). However, ACAT1 protein expression level is not significantly altered in these 
cancer and leukemia cells compared to normal proliferating cells, or in human primary 
leukemia cells compared to healthy peripheral blood samples (Figure 1A–1B). Moreover, 
although ACAT1 was found to be significantly elevated in aggressive prostate cancer 
(Saraon et al., 2014), ACAT1 gene expression is not significantly upregulated in diverse

 human cancers according to Oncomine™ Cancer Genomics Data Analysis (Figure S1A). 
These results suggest that the underlying molecular mechanism for sustained ACAT1 
activation in cancer cells likely does not involve aberrant ACAT1 gene or protein expression 
levels.
We next found that EGF stimulation activated ACAT1 in NIH/3T3 cells in a time-dependent 
manner (Figure 1C), which is due to increased ACAT1 tetramer formation (Figure 1D) with 
increased tyrosine phosphorylation (Figure 1E). We thus performed a series of in vitro 
kinase assays using purified recombinant tyrosine kinases incubated with ACAT1 protein as 
an exogenous substrate. We found that purified EGFR and FGFR1 directly phosphorylate 
and activate ACAT1 (Figure 1F). Similar results were obtained using purified recombinant 
FLT3, ABL and JAK2 (Figure S1B).
Tetrameric but not monomeric ACAT1 can be phosphorylated at Y407, and such 
phosphorylation promotes tetramer accumulation
We next performed mutational analysis and generated four phospho-deficient Y→F mutants 
of ACAT1 based on public data that identified ACAT1 as phosphorylated at four tyrosine 
residues, including Y90, Y214, Y219 and Y407 (Figure 2A), in human cancer cells (http://
www.phosphosite.org/proteinAction.action?id=9172&showAllSites=true). We found that 
substitution of Y407 with phenylalanine resulted in abolishment of FGFR1-dependent 
activation of ACAT1 (Figure 2B). Further cellular fractionation and Western blot studies 
revealed that EGF treatment induced Y407 phosphorylation of mitochondrial ACAT1 with 
detection of a fraction of EGFR along with ACAT1 in the mitochondrial fraction of 
stimulated NIH/3T3 cells (Figure 2C; upper), while treatment with FGFR1 inhibitor TKI258 
in FGFR1-expressing H1299 cells led to decreased Y407 phosphorylation of ACAT1 in the 
mitochondrial fraction where both ACAT1 and a fraction of FGFR1 were detected (Figure 
2C; lower). These data are consistent with our previous findings of mitochondrial EGFR and 
FGFR1 (Fan et al., 2014; Hitosugi et al., 2011), and other mitochondrial localized tyrosine 
kinases including FLT3, ABL1 and JAK2 (Fan et al., 2014; Hitosugi et al., 2011), which 
may also phosphorylate ACAT1 in mitochondria.
Moreover, we found that Y407 phosphorylation of ACAT1 is commonly upregulated (Figure 
2D, upper) in diverse human leukemia, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, and prostate 
cancer cells with elevated ACAT1 enzyme activity (Figure 1A) compared to corresponding 
control cells. In addition, treatment with distinct tyrosine kinase inhibitors to target different 
leukemogenic tyrosine kinases including FOP2-FGFR1 (TKI258), BCR/ABL (imatinib), 
JAK2-V617F (AG490), FLT3/ITD (TKI258) and FIP1L1-PDGFRA (imatinib) in 
corresponding leukemia cells resulted in decreased levels of ACAT1 Y407 phosphorylation 
(Figure 2D, left lower). Treatment with these inhibitors to target tyrosine kinases including 
JAK2, EGFR, FGFR1 and c-ABL (Figure S1C) in diverse tumor cell lines revealed that 
FGFR1 is responsible for ACAT1 Y407 phosphorylation in H1299 lung cancer cells (Figure 
2D; middle lower), while EGFR represents the upstream kinase of ACAT1 in A549 lung 
cancer cells, Tu212 and Tu686 head and neck cancer cells, and PC3 prostate cancer cells 
(Figures S1D and 2D, right lower). Consistently, we found that FGFR1 promotes tetramer 
formation and activation of ACAT1 WT and the control Y90F, Y214F, Y219F mutants,

 whereas Y407F mutant shows resistance to FGFR1 treatment (Figure 2E). Note that only 
ACAT1 tetramers but not monomers were phosphorylated. In addition, substitution of each 
tyrosine residue did not result in a significant decrease in overall tyrosine phosphorylation 
levels of ACAT1 proteins (Figures 2B and 2E), suggesting that none of these tyrosine 
residues represents a major phosphorylation site of ACAT1.
We next purified monomeric and tetrameric ACAT1 proteins using a sucrose density 
ultracentrifugation approach. We found that the majority of recombinant ACAT1 proteins 
are monomers, while phosphorylation by FGFR1 resulted in a shift to tetramer formation 
(Figure 2F). Moreover, to determine whether ACAT1 monomers and/or tetramers can be 
phosphorylated by FGFR1, we separated ACAT1 monomers and tetramers on a native gel. 
The gel slices containing tetrameric or monomeric ACAT1 proteins were incubated with 
recombinant FGFR1 in the presence of “cold” ATP or “hot” ATP (γ32P-ATP) in an in vitro 
kinase assay. The results revealed that only tetrameric ACAT1 proteins were phosphorylated 
and labeled by 32P (Figure 2G). These data together suggest that Y407 phosphorylation of 
tetrameric ACAT1 may contribute to accumulation of ACAT1 tetramers. However, Y407 is 
located distal from the sites of enzymatic cleft and tetramerization, and at the molecular 
level it is not clear how phosphorylation mediates long-range effects to impact the 
oligomerization state of ACAT1 (Figure S1E).
Arecoline hydrobromide (AH) is a covalent ACAT1 inhibitor
Currently there is no defined ACAT1 inhibitor available. To better understand the role of 
tetrameric ACAT1 in human cancer, we designed a screening strategy using an in vitro 
ACAT1 assay and identified arecoline hydrobromide (AH; arecoline•HBr) as an ACAT1 
inhibitor from a library of 2,000 FDA approved small molecule compounds (Figure 3A). AH 
is a salt form of arecoline (methyl 1-methyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-3-carboxylate), 
which is a nicotinic acid-based alkaloid found in the areca nut that is commonly referred to 
as betel nut (Gupta and Warnakulasuriya, 2002; Sharan et al., 2012). AH effectively inhibits 
ACAT1 but not two other human acetyltransferases, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 2 
(ACAT2) and dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (DLAT), which were included as 
negative controls (Figure 3B). AH inhibits purified recombinant ACAT1 with an IC50 value 
of approximately 11.1±3.9µM, whereas the IC50 values for AH to inhibit ACAT2 and DLAT 
were not reached (NR; Figure 3B).
Molecular docking study of arecoline based on the crystal structure of ACAT1 (PDB code: 
2IB8; (Haapalainen et al., 2007)) revealed that AH binds to ACAT1 at its catalytic site and 
most of the predicted interaction residues of ACAT1 for AH binding are hydrophobic, 
indicating the ester group of AH is important (Figure 3C). In particular, we predicted that 
AH could covalently bind to a nearby cysteine residue (C126) in the ACAT1 catalytic site 
through a Michael addition reaction (Shiraki et al., 2005) between an α,β-unsaturated ketone 
group in AH and the thiol group of cysteine (Figure 3C). We thus tested such an addition 
reaction using purified L-cysteine and AH in water at pH 7 and 5 (to mimic the acidic 
conditions within tumor). The NMR analysis of the product collected after four hours of the 
reaction at both pH 7 and 5 showed the C=C bond of AH disappeared after the reaction,

 confirming the addition reaction taking place between L-cysteine and AH and thus 
supporting the predicted model (Figure 3D).
We next generated a C126A mutant of ACAT1 and performed a thermal shift assay. The 
results suggested that AH directly binds to ACAT1 WT with Kd value determined as 
33.8±4.4µM, whereas AH did not bind to the C126A mutant and the Kd value was not 
reached (NR) (Figure 3E). In addition, AH effectively inhibited purified recombinant 
ACAT1 wild type (WT) and a control mutant C413A but not ACAT1 C126A mutant (Figure 
3F). Moreover, we generated “rescue” H1299 cells with stable knockdown of endogenous 
ACAT1 followed by rescue expression of ACAT1 WT or distinct C→A mutants. We found 
that AH treatment effectively inhibited enzyme activity of ACAT1 WT and control C413A 
mutant, but not AH binding-deficient C126A mutant (Figure 3G). These results together 
suggest that C126 is important to mediate AH binding and its inhibitory effect on ACAT1.
AH disrupts active ACAT1 tetramers and blocks tetramer reformation
Using purified ACAT1 proteins in the presence or absence of AH, we found that AH inhibits 
ACAT1 by disrupting ACAT1 tetramers to yield monomers (Figure 3H). Further studies 
confirmed that purified tetrameric and monomeric ACAT1 proteins represented active and 
inactive forms of ACAT1, respectively (Figure 3I, left) and ACAT1 activity correlated with 
increasing levels of tetramer in different compositions of purified monomeric and tetrameric 
ACAT1 proteins (Figure 3I, right), while incubation of purified monomeric and tetrameric 
ACAT1 proteins for 12 hours resulted in formation of a small fraction of ACAT1 tetramers 
and monomers, respectively, accompanied with slightly increased and decreased ACAT1 
activity, respectively (Figure 3J). These results suggest an equilibrium between tetrameric 
and monomeric ACAT1 proteins with spontaneous cycles of formation and disruption of 
ACAT1 tetramers.
We next sought to determine whether AH promotes disruption of ACAT1 tetramers or 
blocks monomers from forming tetramers. We separated monomeric and tetrameric ACAT1 
WT or C126A proteins on a native gel. The gel was incubated with 3H-labeled AH and the 
binding ability of 3H-AH to monomeric and tetrameric ACAT1 proteins was assessed by 
scintillation counting of excised gel bands containing ACAT1 monomers or tetramers. The 
results of this “overlay” assay suggested that AH binds to ACAT1 tetramers with higher 
affinity compared to ACAT1 monomers, whereas C126A mutation attenuates AH binding to 
tetramers (note that C126A monomers still bind less than WT monomers) (Figure 3K), 
suggesting AH likely binds to and disrupts ACAT1 tetramers to release monomers. 
Moreover, we found that a small fraction of tetramers were formed from purified ACAT1 
monomers in the absence of AH after 12 hours, whereas monomers resulting from AH-
dependent disruption of ACAT1 tetramers did not form any tetramers (Figure 3L). 
Furthermore, we repeated this native gel experiment using 3H-AH-treated purified ACAT1 
tetramers compared to purified ACAT1 monomers without AH treatment. The scintillation 
counting results suggest that after disruption of ACAT1 tetramer, 3H-AH remains bound to 
ACAT1 monomers (Figure 3M). These data together suggest a “two-step” model where AH 
binds only to tetrameric ACAT1 and disrupts ACAT1 tetramers to yield monomers, while

 although AH cannot bind to ACAT1 monomers, it can bind to monomers resulting from 
tetramer disruption and prevent reformation of tetramers from monomers.
Y407 phosphorylation activates ACAT1 by stabilizing ACAT1 tetramers but not promoting 
tetramer formation from monomers
We found that AH treatment not only attenuated EGF-dependent ACAT1 activation and 
tyrosine phosphorylation of ACAT1 (Figure 4A), but also decreased tetramer formation 
induced by EGF (Figure 4B). In addition, in an in vitro kinase assay using purified proteins, 
AH treatment disrupted ACAT1 tetramers that were induced by FGFR1 incubation. 
Interestingly, the monomeric ACAT1 proteins resulting from FGFR1-phosphoryated ACAT1 
tetramers treated with AH were still phosphorylated at Y407 (Figure 4C). This might be due 
to lack of phosphatase in the in vitro system. In addition, pre-treatment with AH abolished 
FGFR1-dependent activation of ACAT1 (AH>FGFR1) compared to ACAT1 protein 
incubated with FGFR1 prior to AH treatment (FGFR1>AH), while AH eventually inhibited 
phosphorylated and activated ACAT1 (FGFR1>AH) (Figure 4D; left), suggesting that 
decreased tetramer protein levels due to AH dependent disruption provided less substrate for 
FGFR1. Indeed, both FGFR1-dependent tetramer formation and Y407 phosphorylation of 
ACAT1 tetramers pre-treated with AH (AH>FGFR1) were found at lower levels compared 
to tetramerization and tetramer phosphorylation of ACAT1 incubated with FGFR1 prior to 
AH treatment (FGFR1>AH), while AH treatment of ACAT1 phosphorylated by FGFR1 
resulted in decreased protein levels and phosphorylation of ACAT1 tetramers with increased 
protein level of monomers (FGFR1>AH) (Figure 4D; right). Note that monomeric ACAT1 
was not phosphorylated, with the exception of ACAT1 monomers resulting from disruption 
of phosphorylated ACAT1 treated with AH (FGFR1>AH) (Figure 4D; right). These data 
confirm that only tetrameric ACAT1 can be phosphorylated and AH disrupts both 
phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated ACAT1 tetramers.
We next found that phosphorylation by FGFR1 resulted in a shift to tetramer formation of 
ACAT1 WT but not Y407F mutant protein, which is predominantly monomeric in the 
presence and absence of FGFR1 (Figure 4E). In addition, Y407F mutant demonstrated 
resistance to FGFR1-promoted activation and tetramer formation, while AH treatment 
inhibited Y407F mutant enzyme activity by disrupting Y407F tetramers (Figure 4F). These 
data together suggest that Y407 phosphorylation of tetrameric ACAT1 stabilizes ACAT1 
tetramers by preventing spontaneous tetramer disruption, which unbalances the equilibrium 
between tetramer disruption and reformation, leading to a shift to promote spontaneous 
tetramer formation from monomers that eventually achieves phosphorylation of the majority 
of ACAT1 proteins (Figures 2F and 4E).
Y407 phosphorylation of ACAT1 is important for cancer cell proliferation and tumor 
growth, which signals through the PDP1-PDHA1 axis to promote glycolysis
We next generated “rescue” H1299 cells with stable knockdown of endogenous ACAT1 and 
stable rescue expression of FLAG-ACAT1 WT or Y407F mutant (Figure 5A). Consistent 
with our previous findings in rescue H1299 cells with stable knockdown of ACAT1 (Fan et 
al., 2014), expression of catalytically less active ACAT1 Y407F resulted in decreased cell 
proliferation under hypoxia but not normoxia and made cells more sensitive to ATP synthase

 inhibitor oligomycin treatment in term of attenuated cell proliferation, compared to control 
cells expressing ACAT1 WT (Figure 5B). In addition, Y407F rescue cells showed decreased 
phosphorylation and acetylation levels of PDHA and reduced acetylation level of PDP1, 
which correlated with increased PDH activity (PDC flux rate), decreased glycolytic rate and 
lactate production, and elevated ROS level (Figure 5C), oxygen consumption rate and 
intracellular ATP level (Figure 5D), compared to control ACAT1 WT cells. Moreover, 
Y407F cells were more sensitive to treatment with oligomycin in terms of inhibition of 
oxygen consumption and ATP production (Figure 5D). Consistent with these findings, we 
found that decreased cell proliferation under hypoxia in Y407F cells was reversed by 
expression of acetyl-mimetic PDP1 K202Q mutant but not acetyl-deficient K202R mutant 
(Figures 5E–5F), which also reversed the decreased lactate production, as well as elevated 
PDC flux and oxygen consumption rate (Figures 5G–5I, respectively) in Y407F cells, 
compared to control ACAT1 WT cells. Similar results were obtained by expressing PDHA1 
K321Q or K321R mutants in Y407F cells (Figures S2A–S2E). These data together suggest 
that Y407 phosphorylation is important for activation of ACAT1, which predominantly 
signals through the PDP1-PDHA1 axis to promote the metabolic switch from oxidative 
phosphorylation to glycolysis in cancer cells.
Furthermore, in a xenograft experiment, the growth rate and masses (Figure 5J; left two 
panels) of tumors derived from H1299 cells expressing Y407F were significantly reduced. 
This was likely due to decreased ACAT1 activity that led to reduced S293 phosphorylation 
level of PDHA, decreased acetylation levels of PDHA1 K321 and PDP1 K202 (Figure 5J; 
middle two panels) and consequently attenuated cell proliferation assessed by decreased 
IHC staining of proliferation marker Ki67 (Figure S2F, and 5J; right panel) in tumors 
derived from Y407F cells compared to those formed by control ACAT1 WT cells.
AH inhibits glycolysis as well as cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo
AH effectively inhibits ACAT1 enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner in H1299 
(Figure 6A) and K562 cells (Figure S3A), as well as cell proliferation of diverse human 
leukemia and cancer cells compared to control cells (Figure 6B), suggesting selective 
toxicity of AH in treatment of human cancer cells. In contrast, stable knockdown of ACAT1 
conferred resistance to H1299 cells to treatment with increasing concentrations of AH in 
terms of ACAT1 activity and cell proliferation rate (Figure 6C, left and right, respectively), 
suggesting that AH as a selective ACAT1 inhibitor has no off-target effect when inhibiting 
cancer cell proliferation.
In addition, AH treatment effectively inhibits Y407 phosphorylation and tetramer formation 
of ACAT1 in K562 and H1299 cells (Figure 6D), leading to increased PDH activity (PDC 
flux rate) with decreased lactate production in H1299 (Figure S3B) and K562 (Figure S3C) 
cells, as well as decreased glycolytic rate, increased oxygen consumption rate, and elevated 
intracellular ATP (Figures S3D–S3F, respectively), compared to control untreated cells. AH 
treated cells are more sensitive to oligomycin treatment in terms of inhibition of oxygen 
consumption and ATP production (Figures S3E–S3F), suggesting that AH inhibits ACAT1 
to attenuate glycolysis and promotes oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, AH treatment 
similarly resulted in increased PDH activity, decreased lactate production, increased oxygen

 consumption rate with elevated intracellular ATP, as well as decreased cell proliferation rate 
under hypoxia (Figures S4A–S4D and 6E, respectively) in H1299 “rescue” cells with stable 
knockdown of PDP1 or PDHA1 and stable expression of PDP1 WT or PDHA WT, 
respectively. In contrast, “rescue” cells expressing either acetyl-mimetic K→Q or acetyl-
deficient K→R forms of PDP1 or PDHA1 demonstrated resistance to AH treatment in terms 
of these altered metabolic properties (Figures. S4A–S4D, respectively) and cell proliferation 
rate (Figure 6E). These results are consistent with the observation that AH treatment resulted 
in reduced S293 phosphorylation level of PDHA as well as decreased acetylation levels of 
PDHA1 K321 and PDP1 K202 in H1299 and K562 cells (Figure S4E). These data suggest 
that AH predominantly targets ACAT1, leading to subsequently altered PDC flux that is 
predominantly important for the changes in cancer cell metabolism and proliferation. 
Interestingly, inhibition of ACAT1 by AH treatment (Figure S4F) or stable knockdown 
(Figure S4G) did not affect the intracellular levels of these two major ketone bodies in cells, 
suggesting that upregulated ACAT1 primarily contributes to the metabolic switch from 
OXPHOS to glycolysis in cancer cells.
Initial toxicity studies of chronic injection of AH to nude mice for ~4 weeks revealed that 
treatment with AH at dose up to 50mg/kg/day administered intraperitoneally was well-
tolerated, and did not affect complete blood counts (CBC) or hematopoietic properties of 
nude mice (Figure S5A). Further histopathological analyses revealed no notable differences 
between PBS as the vehicle and AH-treated groups in tissue samples from different organs 
(Figure S5B). These results demonstrate that AH treatment has minimal toxicity in vivo. We 
next performed an in vivo AH treatment experiment using xenograft nude mice with 
subcutaneous injection of H1299 cells, where AH led to decreased dose-dependent reduction 
in tumor mass with reduced growth (Figure 6F, left and right, respectively), and did not 
affect hematopoietic properties of treated nude mice either (Figure S5C). Further drug 
treatment experiments using the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 50mg/kg/day revealed 
that AH treatment inhibited tumor growth in H1299 xenograft mice (Figure 6G; left two 
panels) with decreased ACAT1 activity accompanied with reduced S293 phosphorylation 
level of PDHA and lysine acetylation levels of PDHA1 and PDP1 (Figure 6G; right two 
panels) in resected tumors from xenograft nude mice, along with reduced Ki67 expression 
assessed by IHC staining in tumors (Figure 6H). Similar results were obtained using K562 
leukemia cell xenograft nude mice treated with AH for 20 days (Figures S5D–S5E). 
Moreover, AH treatment decreased Y407 phosphorylation level and tetramer formation of 
ACAT1 in tumors derived from K562 and H1299 cells (Figure 6I) with increased PDH 
activity and decreased glycolytic rate as well as increased sensitivity to oligomycin 
treatment in terms of intracellular ATP levels (Figure S5F). These results suggest that AH 
inhibits ACAT1 in vivo without off-target effect, conferring a specific inhibitory effect on 
tumor cell proliferation by promoting a metabolic shift from glycolysis to OXPHOS.
AH inhibits Y407 phosphorylation of tetrameric ACAT1, which is commonly upregulated in 
primary human leukemia cells
Consistently, ACAT1 enzyme activity levels are commonly upregulated in diverse human 
primary leukemia cells from patients (Figures 1B and 7A; left), which is due to increased 
Y407 phosphorylation and tetramer formation with comparable ACAT1 protein expression

 levels (Figures 7A; right, 7B and S6A) compared to control peripheral blood (PB) cells from 
healthy donors. Moreover, AH did not affect cell viability of CD34+ progenitors isolated 
from bone marrow samples from a healthy donor, or mononucleocytes in PB samples from a 
representative healthy human donor (Figure 7C, left and right, respectively), In contrast, 
human primary leukemia cells treated with AH had decreased cell viability (Figures 7D; left, 
and S6B) with reduced Y407 phosphorylation of ACAT1 (Figures 7D; right, and S6C). 
Consistent with these results, AH effectively inhibited ACAT1 enzyme activity in diverse 
primary human leukemia cells (Figures S7A and 7E; right two panels), but not basal level 
ACAT1 activity in control CD34+ progenitors and mononucleocytes in PB samples from 
healthy donors (Figure 7E; left two panels). In addition, AH treatment disrupted tetrameric 
ACAT1 in human primary leukemia cells (Figures 7F and S7B–S7C) but did not affect levels 
of monomeric ACAT1 in CD34+ BM or PB samples from healthy donors (Figure S7C). 
Together these data suggest targeting ACAT1 as a promising therapeutic strategy in the 
treatment of human malignancies, and AH as an ACAT1 inhibitor with minimal toxicity to 
human blood cells.
DISCUSSION
Our findings reveal a molecular mechanism underlying tetrameric ACAT1 regulation in 
normal proliferating and highly proliferative cancer cells, and suggest that targeting ACAT1 
tetramer stability represents a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of human 
cancer (Figure 7G). In this model, our results suggest a spontaneous equilibrium between 
monomeric and tetrameric ACAT1 proteins in cells, which represent inactive and active 
ACAT1 forms, respectively. In normal proliferating cells such as EGF-stimulated cells, only 
ACAT1 tetramers can be phosphorylated by a fraction of mitochondria-localized EGFR 
tyrosine kinase, leading to stabilization of active ACAT1 tetramers. Moreover, this 
mechanism is “hijacked” in human cancer cells, where oncogenic tyrosine kinase signaling 
is commonly upregulated. These findings suggests a molecular mechanism by which 
proliferative and oncogenic events signal through distinct acetyltransferases to regulate 
metabolic enzymes via cyclic acetylation/deacetylation.
Our results also demonstrate that none of the four identified tyrosine residues including Y90, 
Y214, Y219 and Y407 represents a major phosphorylation site of ACAT1 upon FGFR1 
treatment. There might exist unidentified tyrosine residue(s) that, when phosphorylated, 
represent the majority of tyrosine phosphorylation of ACAT1 by FGFR1. This may be due to 
such Tyr-modification site(s) being incompatible with the common LC-MS platform, which 
is possible. It is also possible that phosphorylation of one sister molecule in an ACAT1 
tetramer is sufficient to stabilize the tetramer, thus it is not necessary to achieve 
phosphorylation of all four sister molecules. Nevertheless, although Y407 is not a major 
phosphorylation site of ACAT1 by FGFR1, Y407 phosphorylation is sufficient to enhance 
ACAT1 tetramer formation and consequently increase ACAT1 activity to promote the 
Warburg effect and tumor growth.
AH as a potent ACAT1 inhibitor only binds to and disrupts active ACAT1 tetramers despite 
its phosphorylation status, while AH-bound monomeric ACAT1 proteins cannot reform 
active ACAT1 tetramers (Figure 7G). Moreover, AH inhibits cell proliferation of diverse

 human cancer cells and primary leukemia cells from human patients as well as tumor growth 
of xenograft nude mice with no obvious off target effect and minimal toxicity. In addition, 
Lo et al. recently suggested that ACAT1 may confer doxorubicin resistance to uterine cancer 
cells (Lo et al., 2015). These data provide “proof of principle” to suggest targeting 
tetrameric ACAT1 as a promising therapy in the clinical treatment of human cancer patients 
with elevated ACAT1 activity and glycolysis rate, as well as relapsed cancer patients with 
chemo-resistance.
One reasonable concern is that targeting ACAT1 might have off-target effects other than 
impact on PDC flux in cells due to possible additional ACAT1 targets besides reported 
PDHA and PDP1. However, our results show that rescue cancer cells expressing acetyl-
mimetic K→Q or acetyl-deficient K→R mutants of PDHA or PDP1 demonstrated 
resistance to attenuation of ACAT1 by AH treatment or expression of Y407F mutant in 
terms of alteration of cell proliferation, PDC flux, or glycolysis and oxidative 
phosphorylation rates. Another concern is that, although our results showed that inhibition of 
ACAT1 did not affect intracellular levels of ketone bodies in cancer cells, since ACAT1 is 
involved in beta-oxidation, targeting ACAT1 may result in similar phenotypes of “beta-
ketothiolase deficiency” that is a rare, autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by 
defective mitochondrial ACAT1 due to point mutations, which is characterized by an 
attenuated ability to process isoleucine amino acid or the products of lipid breakdown with 
an increased level of cholesterol (Fukao et al., 1992). These concerns warrant further 
detailed toxicity, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics studies to evaluate the proposed 
anti-ACAT1 therapies in cancer treatment.
Arecoline hydrobromide is a salt form of arecoline, which is a nicotinic acid-based alkaloid 
found in the areca nut that is commonly referred to as betel nut (Gupta and Warnakulasuriya, 
2002; Sharan et al., 2012). Clinically, low dose intravenous application of arecoline 
hydrobromide has been used to treat Alzheimer's disease (Christie et al., 1981; Tariot et al., 
1988). Arecoline hydrobromide was reported to induce HA22T/VGH hepatoma cells to 
undergo anoikis (Cheng et al., 2010) and arecoline causes epigenetic changes in K562 
leukemia cells that lead to chemical-mediated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity (Lin et al., 
2011). However, arecoline has also been associated with the development of oral 
premalignant lesions and risk of oral cancer in many areas of Asia, the Pacific region, and in 
migrant communities in the United Kingdom, United States and South Africa where betel 
chewing is prevalent (Gupta and Warnakulasuriya, 2002; Sharan et al., 2012). Several animal 
studies have shown that arecoline administered by oral gavage to male mice induced lung 
adenocarcinoma and liver hemangioma (Bhide et al., 1984; Bhide et al., 1979), and chronic 
oral administration of arecoline through drinking water resulted in oral squamous cell 
carcinoma in mice (Lin et al., 2015b). However, arecoline was found not mitogenic to oral 
mucosal fibroblasts, and it causes cell cycle arrest of cultured oral KB epithelial cells 
(Chang et al., 2001; Tsai et al., 1997). Our results also demonstrate the inhibitory effect of 
intraperitoneal injection with arecoline hydrobromide on tumor growth in xenograft mice. 
Thus, further detailed studies are warranted to decipher the molecular and pharmacological 
mechanisms underlying acecoline treatment in vitro and in vivo, optimize dosage, duration 
and alternative application routes of in vivo treatment with arecoline and related compounds,

 and develop second generation of anti-ACAT1 drugs with improved potency and reduced 
potential cancer risk for future clinical application.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
ACAT1 activity assay and inhibitor screening
An in vitro ACAT1 activity assay was performed as described (Haapalainen et al., 2007) to 
identify lead compounds as ACAT1 inhibitors using a library of 2,000 biologically active 
compounds (The Spectrum Collection; MicroSource). In brief, 100ng purified ACAT1 
protein was added to assay buffer containing 50mM Tris–HCl (pH8.1), 20mM MgCl2, 
40mM KCl, 10µM acetoacetyl-CoA, and 60µM CoA. The change in absorbance at 303 nm 
was measured using a SpectraMax Plus spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices).
Thermal melt shift assay
In brief, thermal shift assay of compound-protein interaction was performed in 96-well PCR 
plates with various compound concentrations and 200µg/ml protein in a buffer solution 
(20mM Tris-HCl, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4) according to the instruction of Protein Thermal 
Shift Dye Kit (Thermo Fisher). Small molecules were dissolved in DMSO and added to 
protein solution. Final DMSO concentration of the solution was 1 %.
Michael addition reaction assay
The standard NMR spectra of arecoline are available online (https://
orgspectroscopyint.blogspot.com/2014/12/arecoline.html). Arecoline hydrobromide (2.36 
mg, 0.01 mmol) and L-cysteine (6.06 mg, 0.05 mmol) were mixed before dissolving in 
deuterium oxide (1 mL) at pH 5 (adjusted by concentrated hydrochloric acid) and 7. The 
solutions were incubated at 37 °C for four hours. Thin layer chromatography was used to 
monitor the reaction. The reaction between arecoline and L-cysteine was confirmed 
by 1HNMR and 13CNMR spectroscopy.
Arecoline hygdrobromide (AH) binding assay
Purified recombinant 6xHis-FLAG-ACAT1 proteins that are immobilized on anti-Flag beads 
were treated with or without rFGFR1 in an in vitro kinase assay. The ACAT1 proteins were 
eluted and separated on a native PAGE gel. The gel was incubated with 0.1 µM [3H]-
Arecoline hygdrobromide (synthesized by American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc) for 2 
hours at 4 °C and then washed twice with TBS to remove the unbound [3H]-Arecoline 
hygdrobromide. The ACAT1 proteins in monomer and tetramer form were cut from the gel 
and the retained [3H]-Arecoline hygdrobromide on both forms of ACAT1 proteins were 
measured using a scintillation counter.
Native PAGE
Native gels were prepared as described (Zong et al., 2010) in 10% acrylamide, 0.375M Tris-
HCl, pH 8.8, without SDS. The cell lysates were mixed with 5×native gel sample buffer 
(312.5mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.05% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol). The gel was run in 
native PAGE buffer (25mM Tris-HCl, 192mM glycine) and followed by Western blotting.

 Sucrose density ultracentrifugation
Sucrose gradient centrifugation was previously performed as described (Anastasiou et al., 
2012). In brief, purified recombinant 6xHis-FLAG-ACAT1 was laid on a 10–40% sucrose 
gradient and spun at 50,000 rpm for 12 hours using a Beckman MLS-50 rotor and fractions 
were analyzed by Coomassie blue staining and Immunoblotting.
Xenograft study and studies using primary human tissue samples from patients
Approvals of mice use and experimental designs were given by the Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee of Emory University. Approval of use of human specimens was 
given by the Institutional Review Board of Emory University School of Medicine. All 
clinical samples were obtained with informed consent with approval by the Emory 
University Institutional Review Board. Clinical information for the patients was obtained 
from the pathologic files at Emory University Hospital under the guidelines and with 
approval from the Institutional Review Board of Emory University School of Medicine and 
according to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

tumor samples were tested for ACAT1 enzyme activity (middle), Western blot and cell 
proliferation assessed by IHC staining of Ki67 (right two panels). Data are mean ± s.d; n=3 
each; p values were obtained by a two-tailed Student’s test. For tumor growth, data are mean 
± SEM; p values were obtained by a two-way Anova test.
