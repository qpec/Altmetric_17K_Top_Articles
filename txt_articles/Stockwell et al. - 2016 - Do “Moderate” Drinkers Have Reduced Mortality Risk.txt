ABSTRACT. Objective: Previous meta-analyses of cohort studies
indicate a J-shaped relationship between alcohol consumption and all-
cause mortality, with reduced risk for low-volume drinkers. However,
low-volume drinkers may appear healthy only because the “abstainers”
with whom they are compared are biased toward ill health. The purpose
of this study was to determine whether misclassifying former and oc-
casional drinkers as abstainers and other potentially confounding study
characteristics underlie observed positive health outcomes for low-
volume drinkers in prospective studies of all-cause mortality. Method: A
systematic review and meta-regression analysis of studies investigating
alcohol use and mortality risk after controlling for quality-related study
characteristics was conducted in a population of 3,998,626 individuals,
among whom 367,103 deaths were recorded. Results: Without adjust-
ment, meta-analysis of all 87 included studies replicated the classic
J-shaped curve, with low-volume drinkers (1.3–24.9 g ethanol per
day) having reduced mortality risk (RR = 0.86, 95% CI [0.83, 0.90]).
Occasional drinkers (<1.3 g per day) had similar mortality risk (RR =
0.84, 95% CI [0.79, 0.89]), and former drinkers had elevated risk (RR
= 1.22, 95% CI [1.14, 1.31]). After adjustment for abstainer biases and
quality-related study characteristics, no significant reduction in mortality
risk was observed for low-volume drinkers (RR = 0.97, 95% CI [0.88,
1.07]). Analyses of higher-quality bias-free studies also failed to find re-
duced mortality risk for low-volume alcohol drinkers. Risk estimates for
occasional drinkers were similar to those for low- and medium-volume
drinkers. Conclusions: Estimates of mortality risk from alcohol are
significantly altered by study design and characteristics. Meta-analyses
adjusting for these factors find that low-volume alcohol consumption has
no net mortality benefit compared with lifetime abstention or occasional
drinking. These findings have implications for public policy, the formula-
tion of low-risk drinking guidelines, and future research on alcohol and
health. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 77, 185–198, 2016)

T
HERE HAS BEEN INCREASING DISCUSSION
within the field of alcohol epidemiology regarding the
scientific status of claimed health benefits from the con-
sumption of alcohol in relatively low doses (Chikritzhs et al.,
2015; Holmes et al., 2014). The status of the hypothesis that
alcohol in moderation confers health benefits has implica-
tions for estimations of the global burden of disease from
alcohol (Lim et al., 2012) and the development of public
health policies to reduce alcohol’s harm (Babor et al., 2010)
and national guidelines for low-risk alcohol use (Stockwell
& Room, 2012).
It has been suggested that the epidemiological (Ronks-
ley et al., 2011) and physiological evidence (Brien et al.,
2011) for both an association and a causal mechanism
is sufficiently compelling to recommend consideration
of advising abstainers to drink. However, an increasing
number of questions have been raised about the quality of
the studies contained in these meta-analyses. We first sum-
marize some reasons for skepticism and then present new
meta-analyses that explore the extent to which alternative
study designs enhance or minimize associations indicative
of health benefits.
Theoretical and empirical background
Evidence of health benefits from alcohol use has been
reported for implausible types and numbers of health
conditions in observational longitudinal studies. Fekjaer
(2013) identified a long list of such conditions (including
deafness, hip fractures, the common cold, cancers, birth
complications, dementia, and liver cirrhosis) in which the
classic J-shape curve was observed, with lower risk for
low-volume drinkers compared with abstainers. In some
cases—notably a reduced likelihood of alcoholic liver cir-
rhosis among low-volume drinkers (Rehm et al., 2010) and
of developmental disorders of infants born of low-volume
drinking mothers (Kelly et al., 2009)—a causal basis for
such associations is highly unlikely. These findings raise
 186
JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / MARCH 2016
the question as to whether a range of lifestyle and/or ge-
netic confounding factors that favor “moderate drinkers”
over abstainers are responsible.
Naimi et al. (2005) reported that 27 (90%) of 30 potential
adverse confounders for coronary heart disease were more
prevalent among abstainers than among moderate drink-
ers. Fillmore et al. (2006) classified prospective studies on
alcohol and health according to their definition of “an ab-
stainer” (i.e., the reference group that all classes of drinker
are typically compared with in these studies). They reported
that when studies explicitly excluded former and occasional
drinkers from the abstainer reference group, there was lim-
ited evidence of protection from moderate alcohol con-
sumption. The underlying theory was that as people age and
become unwell, they are more likely to quit or substantially
reduce their alcohol consumption, leading to an exaggeration
of the already poor health profiles of abstainers (Kerr et al.,
2002; Shaper et al., 1988).
Consistent with this view, Mäkelä et al. (2005) showed
that reclassifying former drinkers as abstainers, thereby
placing them in the reference group, markedly lowered the
relative risk (RR) estimates for all active drinkers. Taking a
more rigorous approach to the role of potential bias caused
by former drinkers, Liang and Chikritzhs (2013) argued that
former drinkers should be combined with current drinkers
when drinking groups are compared with lifelong abstainers
and that bias is not eliminated by merely separating former
drinkers from abstainers.
A recent investigation of a large cohort from the Euro-
pean Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC; Bergmann
et al., 2013) used an analysis that took into account mortality
risks from multiple and competing causes at multiple points
over the life course. A reduced risk of death from heart
disease was associated with alcohol consumption, but only
when study participants with a history of ill health were ex-
cluded from analysis. Such exclusions are often conducted to
mitigate confounding but may also be a source of selection
bias. The authors concluded: “The apparent health benefit of
low to moderate alcohol-use found in observational studies
could therefore in large part be due to various selection bi-
ases and competing risks, which are related to both lifetime
alcohol use and risk of disease, usually occurring later in
life” (Bergmann et al., p. 1789).
Competing risks are also an issue for studies of all-cause
mortality because the comparative risk of different diseases
varies across the life course (e.g., coronary disease usually
occurs later in life than does injury, cancer, or liver disease).
This in turn creates selection bias in the sampling of indi-
viduals available to participate in cohort studies, especially
in older cohorts (Stockwell & Chikritzhs, 2013).
The kinds of methodological problems identified above
are quite common in this literature, in particular the practice
of misclassifying former and occasional drinkers as abstain-
ers (Stockwell et al., 2012).
Objective and overall analytic strategy
The purpose of the current study was to investigate the
extent to which abstainer reference group bias (e.g., mixing
former and occasional drinkers with abstainers) and other
potential study-level confounders influence the risk rela-
tionship between alcohol use and mortality. Changes in RR
estimates will also be examined after progressively excluding
studies from meta-analyses based on theory-driven meth-
odological design problems outlined in previous critiques
(Stockwell & Chikritzhs, 2013; Stockwell et al., 2012).
Consistency of results across these different analyses will
be assessed to address the question as to whether low-dose
alcohol consumption provides net protection in relation to
all-cause mortality.
Method
Overall approach
We performed a systematic review following the Pre-
ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al., 2009) on
original prospective studies concerning the association
between alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality. The
study protocol was first approved as an R01 grant appli-
cation to the U.S. National Institutes of Health (Award #
1RO1AAO19939–02) and is presented as online Appendix
A. (See “Supplementary Materials” available with this article
online.) The codebook is also available from the authors on
request.
Inclusion criteria
Included studies were original English-language research
articles published in the peer-reviewed literature that quanti-
fied the relationship between all-cause mortality and alcohol
consumption among human populations in cohort studies.
All genders, age groups, and subjects from any racial, eth-
nic, cultural, or religious groups were eligible for inclusion,
regardless of geographic region. Studies were excluded if
all-cause mortality outcomes could not be separated from
morbidity outcomes. Studies were also excluded if the
sample was defined in terms of pre-existing illness or poor
health status. When more than one publication of the same
study was available, the most recent or comprehensive in its
treatment of potential bias and confounding was selected.
Data sources
We identified all potentially relevant English-language
articles published up to December 31, 2014, by searching
PubMed (last searched February 25, 2015) and the Web of
Science and through reference list cross-checking of previ-
ous meta-analyses.
 STOCKWELL ET AL.

Search strategy
We used the following key words and subject headings
to identify relevant articles in electronic databases: [mor-
tality OR death OR coronary heart disease OR coronary
artery disease OR ischemic heart disease OR atherosclerotic
heart disease] AND [alcohol OR consumption OR ethanol
OR alcohol drinking] AND [cohort OR prospective OR
longitudinal].
Study selection
Two trained reviewers read the titles of all the citations
retrieved from the electronic database searches and removed
those clearly unrelated to the relationship between mortality
and alcohol consumption. At the next stage of study selec-
tion, abstracts were reviewed to further exclude studies that
clearly did not meet inclusion criteria. At the third stage, the
full articles were checked for eligibility with cross-checking
by senior investigators. Reasons for exclusion were docu-
mented at each stage. The reference lists from two previous
meta-analyses—Fillmore et al. (2006) and Ronksley et al.
(2011)—also were searched for additional eligible studies
that would not otherwise have been included.
Data extraction
Two reviewers extracted and coded data from all studies
fulfilling the inclusion criteria, and any disagreements were
resolved by discussion with the investigators. The original
Fillmore et al. (2006) codebook was refined to provide more
detailed classifications of the type of reference groups used
and methods of quantifying alcohol consumption and study
characteristics. The coding of all variables in the analysis
presented here was double-checked by the first two authors
(T.S. and J.Z.).
Data items
Summary measures of outcome. The outcome of interest
was defined as all-cause mortality. Hazard ratios and rate
ratio estimates of mortality in individual studies were used
as the RR estimates. Where studies only reported mortality
rates, these were converted to RR estimates (Woodward,
2000). When occasional drinkers were the reference category
and risk for abstainers was independently assessed, risk val-
ues were recalculated with abstainers as the reference group
(Fillmore et al., 2006).
Measures of alcohol consumption. The primary exposure
variable of interest was mean daily alcohol consumption in
grams of ethanol assessed at baseline. When studies did not
define the grams of alcohol per unit or drink, we used pub-
lished sources for country-specific estimates of typical drink
size varying from 8 g in the United Kingdom to 19.75 g in
Japan (see Appendix A) (International Center for Alcohol
Policies, 2010; Turner, 1990).
We converted alcohol intake into grams per day using
the midpoints of reported categories. For open-ended top
categories (e.g., ≥6 drinks/day) we followed other meta-
analysts by adding three quarters of the range of the next
lowest category to the lower bound (e.g., if 3–5 drinks, this
would be 6+((5–3) × 0.75) = 7.5) (Roerecke & Rehm, 2012).
It was necessary to make some assumption or estimate of
mean consumption for these upper unbounded categories.
We used a predetermined definition of “low-volume”
drinking (up to 20 g of ethanol per day for both men and
women) against which to test the health benefits hypothesis
based on Australian National Health and Medical Research
Council low-risk drinking guidelines (National Health and
Medical Research Council of Australia, 2009). This was
operationalized as up to 24 g per day given that respondents
in the studies reported whole drinks rather than grams: 24 g
per day is closer to two than three 10-g standard drinks per
day. We used the broad definition of “occasional drinking” as
less than one drink per week, because few studies reported
outcomes for drinking less than monthly.
Quality assessment
To identify potential study-level covariates to be con-
trolled in multivariable meta-regression analyses (Greenland,
1998; Normand, 1999), each study was coded for publication
year, sample size, population characteristics (age, gender,
country), and whether covariates (e.g., smoking status,
previous illness) were controlled for in individual studies.
Covariates available for all selected studies were median
age of study participants at first assessment, sex, country in
which a study was conducted, date a study was conducted,
number of years of follow-up, whether persons with previous
illnesses were excluded, and quality of the measure used for
typical daily alcohol intake.
On theoretical grounds, it was expected that a long fol-
low-up period, inclusion of individuals with previous illness-
es, and an earlier age at intake would be study characteristics
that reduce selection biases (Bergmann et al., 2013; Stock-
well & Chikritzhs, 2013). Studies were classified according
to the presence or absence of two key types of potential bias:
(a) including former drinkers and/or (b) including occasional
drinkers in the abstainer reference category.
Following Fillmore et al. (2006), lifetime abstention was
strictly defined as zero consumption and did not include
studies with any level of occasional lifetime or past-year
drinking (e.g., less than 12 drinks or “rarely” or “hardly
ever” drinking). Such self-reported infrequent drinkers have
been shown to greatly underreport their personal consump-
tion (Stockwell et al., 2014; Y
e et al., 2013). When studies
assessed usual or typical drinking patterns over a month or a
week, it was assumed that individuals classified as abstain-
 188
JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / MARCH 2016
ers by this method would include occasional drinkers (e.g.,
abstaining in a typical week is still consistent with drink-
ing less than once a week). We coded a drinking measure
as “adequate” for the purpose of estimating average daily
alcohol intake if both quantity and frequency of drinking
were assessed for a period of at least 1 week. Given that
simple quantity–frequency measures of drinking typically
result in substantial underreporting (e.g., Stockwell et al.,
2014), we recognize these are minimal criteria for adequacy
of measurement, necessitated by the poor overall quality of
drinking measures in this literature.
Analyses
Visual inspection of the data suggested the presence of
extreme outliers among estimates of the risk of all-cause
mortality from drinking. Estimates of RR were classified
as “extreme” when they were outside of the interval of the
sample mean of natural log RR ± 2 times the standard de-
viation of estimates within each drinking category (Acuna
& Rodrigues, 2014; Pagano & Gauvreau, 2000; Wood-
ward, 2000). This procedure identified 11 risk estimates
significantly below the mean (RR range: 0.1–0.46) and
18 risk estimates markedly higher (OR range: 1.89–4.57).
Compared with other available methods (Cook & Weisberg,
1982; Viechtbauer & Cheung, 2010), this is a conservative
approach excluding relatively few risk estimates. Removal
of outliers made no substantive difference to the results;
therefore, models are presented without any outlier estimates
excluded.
Publication bias was assessed first through visual inspec-
tion of the funnel plot of log-RR of all-cause mortality due
to alcohol consumption against the inverse standard error of
log-RR (see Figure C1 in Appendix C) (Woodward, 2000),
and also by Egger’s linear regression method (Egger et al.,
1997). We also assessed between-study heterogeneity of RRs
using Cochran’s Q (Cochran, 1954) and the I2 statistic (Hig-
gins & Thompson, 2002). When significant heterogeneity
was detected, mixed-effects models were used to obtain the
summarized RR estimates.
Mixed regression analyses were performed in which
drinking groups and control variables were treated as fixed
effects with a random-intercept study effect (Normand,
1999). The dependent variable was the natural log of the RR
estimated using the rate ratio or hazard ratio of each drink-
ing group in relation to the abstainer category. Analyses
were weighted by the inverse of the estimated variance of
the natural log RR. Variance was estimated from reported
standard errors or confidence intervals (CIs). The weights
for each individual study were created using the inverse
variance weight method used in mixed regression analysis
in order to get maximum precision for the main results of
the meta-analysis (Woodward, 2000). Studies with large or
small estimates and/or variance can be highly influential.
Sensitivity analyses also were run after excluding such stud-
ies to detect influential cases (Woodward, 2000).
Drinking levels were examined in terms of predefined
specific consumption levels. Drinking categories were
defined as (a) lifetime abstainers; (b) former drinkers now
completely abstaining; (c) current occasional drinkers, up to
one drink per week (<1.30 g per day); (d) low-volume drink-
ers, up to two drinks or 1.30–24.9 g per day; (e) medium-
volume drinkers, up to four drinks or 25–44.9 g per day; (f)
high-volume drinkers, up to six drinks or 45–64.9 g per day;
and (g) higher volume drinkers, more than six drinks or 65 g
per day. The adequacy of methods used by studies also was
assessed against minimal quality criteria as discussed above.
Median cohort age, sex, country, quality of drinking mea-
sure, and abstainer bias variables were included as covariates
in adjusted models. The country in which a study was con-
ducted was dichotomized into those with mainly Caucasian
populations versus without variable to reflect evidence that
health protection from moderate drinking was more likely to
be observed among Caucasians (Kerr et al., 2011).
Other covariates were selected for inclusion on empirical
grounds based on p values of bivariable tests of the natural
log-RR and each covariate, and significant correlations with
other variables. Based on bivariable analysis of the data set,
any variable producing a bivariable test result with p < .20
was considered a candidate for the multivariable regression
analyses of the natural log-RR of all-cause mortality and alco-
hol consumption (Hosmer & Lemeshow, 2000). Independent
variables with particularly high intercorrelations (>.30) were
identified, less precise measures were excluded (Stokes et al.,
2000), and the variable pool was reduced to avoid synony-
mous variables and collinearity (Pagano & Gauvreau, 2000).
Median age of a study cohort was treated as a continuous
variable, whereas other variables with fixed multiple response
options were all reduced to two or three category variables
(see Table 1 and Table D1 in online Appendix D) to remove
options with few or no values and to make the models more
efficient. Median age of the study population at intake,
gender, or being a mainly Caucasian versus non-Caucasian
population were tested as possible effect modifiers of the
relationship between alcohol consumption and mortality.
No significant interactions were observed; therefore, pooled
meta-analyses of all studies are presented.
All significance tests assumed two-tailed p values or 95%
CIs. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS Ver-
sion 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), and the SAS PROC
MIXED procedure was used to model the log-transformed
RR.
Synthesis of results
We used three separate meta-analytical approaches to
explore the role of abstainer biases caused by drinker mis-
classification errors and other predetermined study quality
 STOCKWELL ET AL.
189
variables. For the first approach (Table 3), analyses were con-
ducted on all 87 studies with the effects of various abstainer
biases controlled for by inclusion of covariates in all models.
Second, stratified meta-analyses were performed on four
distinct subsets of studies grouped according to the num-
ber and type of abstainer biases present (Table 4). A third
approach (Table 5) modeled only studies that met stricter
quality criteria; that is, the analysis included studies in which
only strictly defined lifetime abstainers were included in the
reference group, there was an adequate measure of mean
daily alcohol volume, smoking status was controlled for, and
median age of the study population was less than 60 years at
intake (to minimize lifetime selection biases at enrollment)
and at least 55 years at follow-up (i.e., an age at which coro-
nary heart disease and hence potential health protection may
occur). Sensitivity analyses were conducted in which studies
were excluded one at a time to determine if they were influ-
ential in the significance of observed estimates. Synthesis
of results essentially involved examining the consistency of
results across these three analytic strategies.

Results
Study selection
Of the 2,662 studies initially identified, 87 satisfied the
criteria for meta-analysis on all-cause mortality outcomes
after further removing studies for reasons identified in Figure
1. Citations and details of all included studies can be found
in Tables B1–4 in online Appendix B.
Study characteristics including controls for potential bias
The 87 selected studies included a total of 523 esti-
mates of the risk relationships between levels of alcohol
consumption and all-cause mortality. Among these, 30
studies reported separate estimates for men and women,
31 for men only, 7 for women only, and 19 for both com-
bined. Only 13 of these studies (127 risk estimates) were
coded as free of abstainer biases because they strictly
defined lifetime abstainers as the reference group. Table 1
summarizes these and other study characteristics. A sum-
mary of potentially confounding variables controlled for
or not in each study is provided in online Appendix D
(Table D1).
Results of individual studies
Two forest plots illustrate the range of RR estimates for (a)
any level of drinking (Figure C2 in online Appendix C) and
(b) low-volume drinking (Figure 2) across individual studies
(Woodward, 2000). Consistent with most previous meta-
analyses, these indicate (a) a wide range of estimates across
differentstudiesand (b) meanestimatesfor low-volumedrink-
ing significantly below unity, indicating health protection in
comparison with abstainers. When all drinking outcomes are
considered collectively in each study and compared against
those for abstainers, no significant overall difference is ob-
served, although again there is great variation across studies
(see also Figure C2 in onlineAppendix C).
Synthesis of results
Pooled estimates of all-cause mortality with limited
adjustment. Table 2 presents mean estimates of all-cause
mortality risk by level of alcohol intake with standard ad-
justments only for both precision and between-study varia-
tion in estimates. Analyses of simple RR means indicated a
significant protective effect for both low-volume (RR = 0.86,
95% CI [0.83, 0.90], p < .0001) and occasional drinkers

(RR = 0.84, 95% CI [0.79, 0.89], p < .0001). Significantly
increased risk was evident for former (RR = 1.22, 95% CI
[1.14, 1.31], p < .0001), high-volume (RR = 1.12, 95% CI
[1.07, 1.17], p < .0001), and higher volume drinkers (RR =
1.29, 95% CI [1.22, 1.36], p < .0001). There was significant
heterogeneity across studies (p < .001) for all drinking cat-
egories using the Q statistic and with I2 estimates also all
significant and above 50%. No significant publication bias
was detected using Egger’s linear regression tests at the .05
significance level for individual drinking categories or all
drinkers combined.
Table 2 also presents RR estimates using occasional
drinkers instead of abstainers as the reference, as recom-
mended by some prominent researchers (Rehm et al., 2008).
The methodology for these estimates is detailed in Box 1,
online Appendix A. Compared with occasional drinkers, in
this model abstainers were at significantly higher risk (RR =
1.19, 95% CI [1.12, 1.27], p < .0001), low-volume drinkers
were not at significantly different risk (RR = 1.02, 95% CI
[0.95, 1.10]), and all drinkers combined were at significantly
higher risk (RR = 1.24, 95% CI [1.08, 1.42], p = .0133).
Pooled estimates of all-cause mortality after adjustment.
Table 3 illustrates two further mixed models with suc-
cessive adjustments for (a) the precision of estimates and
between-study variation and (b) the addition of key study
characteristics treated as covariates. In fully adjusted mod-
els no significant protection was estimated for occasional
(RR = 0.95, 95% CI [0.85, 1.05]), low-volume (RR = 0.97,
95% CI [0.88, 1.07]), or medium-volume drinkers (RR =
1.07, 95% CI [0.97, 1.18]). In each model, both former
and high-volume drinkers showed a significantly elevated
risk of all-cause mortality. The same pattern of results was
obtained in sensitivity analyses after elimination of outliers
(not reported).
Figure 3 summarizes the changes in the all-cause mortal-
ity RR estimates for low-volume drinkers after successive
inclusion of key covariates. As controls for abstainer biases
and key covariates are removed, the RR estimate changes
from 0.97 (95% CI [0.88, 1.07]) down to 0.86 (95% CI [0.83,
0.90]). Further details of the impact of removing individual
covariates from the model are shown in online Appendix E,
which confirms the importance of former drinker bias while
suggesting that occasional drinker bias may be less influential.
Estimates of all-cause mortality risk among studies strati-
fied by abstainer bias. Although all models using studies
with at least one abstainer bias showed evidence of health
benefits, the risk of all-cause mortality for low-volume
drinkers in bias-free studies (Model 4 in Table 4) was not
significantly reduced, although the RR was below unity. By
contrast, mortality risk was significantly elevated among
higher volume drinkers as well as former drinkers in these
models. The available estimates for occasional drinkers (only
Model 2 and Model 4 in Table 4) found no significant reduc-
tion or elevation in risk of all-cause mortality. Similar results
were obtained in sensitivity analyses excluding outliers.
Meta-analysis of higher quality studies. As shown in
Table 5, meta-analysis of seven higher quality studies free
from abstainer bias indicated no significantly altered risk of
all-cause mortality for any drinking group with the exception
of a raised risk for higher volume drinkers (RR = 1.58, 95%
CI [1.05, 2.38], p = .0295). Sensitivity analysis that each
excluded just one study at a time identified Friesema et al.
(2007) as being highly influential. The analysis of outliers
in the pooled sample of 87 studies also identified 6 of the 8
estimates in this study as extreme outliers.
When this study was removed, all RR estimates in-
creased with both former (RR = 1.31, 95% CI [1.11, 1.55],
p = .0022) and medium-volume drinkers (RR = 1.29, 95%
CI [1.06, 1.56], p = .0106) having significantly elevated
all-cause mortality risk. The risk estimate for low-volume
drinkers was close to unity (RR = 1.04, 95% CI [0.95,
1.15]). Results were otherwise stable after removal of each

obtained in sensitivity analyses after elimination of outliers.
Examination of the heterogeneity of risk estimates across
studies showed these to be significant but substantially

ity covariates in studies of the relationship between alcohol
consumption and all-cause mortality. Drinker misclassi-
fication errors were common. Of 87 studies identified, 65
included former drinkers in the “abstainer” reference group,
50 included occasional drinkers, and only 13 were free from
both these abstainer biases. However, even this last group
contained other potentially serious methodological problems
that could have biased results in either direction.
Using several analytic approaches, we found evidence that
abstainer biases and other study characteristics influenced the
shape of the risk relationship between mortality and rising al-
cohol consumption. In summary, analyses of groups of higher
quality studies free from abstainer biases were less likely to
find evidence of reduced risk of mortality (i.e., health benefits)
at low levels of alcohol consumption. Rather, the pattern of
results is more consistent with a linear dose response than a

in adjusted models. CI = confidence interval.
J-shaped curve describing the risk relationships between level
of alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality.
Our first analytic strategy involved pooling all 87 stud-
ies and attempting to control for design characteristics and
potential biases in a step-by-step fashion (Table 2 and Table
3). In each model, regardless of degree of adjustment for
design characteristics and covariates, we consistently found
that former drinkers had significantly elevated risk of all-
cause mortality compared with abstainers. This confirms the
well-accepted need to control for former-drinker bias and
not include former drinkers in the abstainer reference group
(Roerecke & Rehm, 2012; Ronksley et al., 2011).
We also replicated the J-shaped curve when only limited
controls for study characteristics were used (i.e., showing
low-volume drinkers with reduced mortality risk and high-
volume drinkers with increased mortality risk). Significant
heterogeneity was detected in these estimates. However, a
J-shaped curve was not observed when abstainer biases and
other study characteristics were controlled for (Table 3). In
the fully adjusted model, mortality risk for former, high-
volume, and higher volume drinkers was increased, whereas
low- and medium-volume drinkers displayed nonsignificant
RRs close to unity (RR = 0.97 and 1.07, respectively).
In each of these pooled models, regardless of level of
control for study-level characteristics, RRs for occasional
drinkers were similar to those for low-volume drinkers. Thus,
if occasional drinkers were used as the reference group (as
recommended by some epidemiologists, e.g., Rehm et al.,
2008), low-volume drinkers would have RRs close to unity
in each of these models (i.e., not be experiencing health
protective effects). Evidence that lifetime abstainers have
poorer health even before their peers begin drinking (Ng Fat
& Shelton, 2012) also provides some support for choosing
occasional drinkers as the reference group and is consistent
with the observation of increased mortality risk for abstain-
ers (RR = 1.19, 95% CI [1.12, 1.27]) versus occasional
drinkers shown in Table 2.
On one hand, it can be argued that occasional drinking in
most developed countries is more normative than abstinence
and also that consumption of less than one drink per week is
unlikely to confer any biological health benefit. On the other
hand, it can be argued that some low-volume drinkers are
underestimating their consumption and are thus misclassified
as occasional drinkers (Stockwell et al., 2014).
The second set of analyses stratified studies according to
the presence or absence of different types of abstainer bias
(Table 4). Here, groups of studies containing former and/
or occasional drinker biases also replicated the J-shaped
curve—that is, significant protection was observed for low-
volume drinkers and elevated risk for higher volume drink-
ers. However, the model with 13 studies free from abstainer
biases showed no significant protection for low-volume
drinkers, although the RR estimate was below unity (RR =
0.90, 95% CI [0.76, 1.06]). Former and higher volume drink-
ers were consistently at increased risk for all-cause mortality
in these models.
A third analysis (Table 5) was performed on higher
quality studies that were free from abstainer biases, used
an “adequate” measure of mean alcohol consumption, fol-
lowed subjects up to an age at which cardiovascular disease
 196
JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / MARCH 2016
becomes a greater risk (at least 55 years), and did not use
an aged population at intake more likely to be subject to an
array of lifetime selection biases (Bergmann et al., 2013).
Once more, there was significantly increased risk of all-
cause mortality for former and higher volume drinkers,
whereas there was no significant protection for low-volume
drinkers (RR = 1.04, 95% CI [0.95, 1.15]). Heterogeneity of
these estimates across studies was still significant, but, for
former, low-, and medium-volume drinkers, it was at a level
considered to have no practical importance. Thus, for each
of the three strategies, evidence for reduced mortality risk
among low-volume drinkers largely disappeared once design
and methodological issues were controlled for directly in the
analysis or by study selection.
Although former drinkers had a 38% increased risk of
mortality compared with lifetime abstainers in the pooled
and fully adjusted model (Table 3), there was mixed
evidence for the importance of controlling for occasional
drinker bias. Only 17 studies reported separate estimates for
occasional drinkers even with the broad definition of less
than one drink per week. In both the pooled model using all
87 studies and the model with the 13 error-free studies, oc-
casional drinkers had reduced mortality risk, although this
was only significant in the pooled model (Table 2). In the
model with 13 error-free studies, however, there were only
three risk estimates available for occasional drinkers and
none at all in the model using the 6 higher quality studies
(i.e., occasional drinkers were misclassified as low-volume
drinkers in these latter studies).
Uncertainty about the significance of occasional-drinker
bias adds a note of caution when interpreting the results of
our final model of higher quality studies. Nonetheless, it may
be that occasional drinkers are a more appropriate reference
group against which to compare low-volume drinkers in that
(a) they may have more personal and lifestyle characteristics
in common with low-volume drinkers that may otherwise
confound observed risk relationships, and (b) it may be im-
plausible to suggest a physiological basis for health benefits
associated with occasional consumption (Knott et al., 2015).
Study characteristics other than drinker misclassification
errors strongly influenced whether health protective effects
were indicated in studies and may be at least as important.
Controlling for some study-level variables (including length
of follow-up, median age, smoking status, and ethnicity) in
the models increased RR estimates for low-volume drink-
ers. This is consistent with evidence for systematic biases
operating across the life course in prospective studies of al-
cohol and health that will be more pronounced among older
populations (Bergmann et al., 2013; Stockwell & Chikritzhs,
2013). The results are also consistent with studies of other
lifestyle factors associated with moderate drinking being
responsible for the appearance of reduced mortality risk
(Naimi et al., 2005) and the possible absence of protective
effects in non-Caucasian populations (Kerr et al., 2011).
Limitations
A number of limitations and caveats around our findings
need to be acknowledged. A major limitation involves imper-
fect measurement of alcohol consumption in most included
studies. Self-reported alcohol consumption is mostly under-
reported (Stockwell et al., 2014), and even the classification
of drinkers as lifetime abstainers can be unreliable (Kerr et
al., 2002). The number of available studies in some stratified
analyses was small, and therefore there may be limited power
to control for potential study-level confounders. However,
the required number of estimates per variable for linear re-
gression can be much smaller than in logistic regression, and
a minimum of at least two estimates per variable is recom-
mended for linear regression analysis (Austin & Steyerberg,
2015), suggesting that the sample sizes were adequate in all
models presented.
It has been demonstrated that a pattern of heavy episodic
(i.e., “binge”) drinking is not associated with the appearance
of reduced health risks even when average daily volume is
low (Roerecke & Rehm, 2010). Too few studies adequately
controlled for this variable to investigate its effect on differ-
ent outcomes across studies. Finally, our findings only apply
to the net effect of alcohol at different doses on all-cause
mortality, and different risk relationships likely apply for
specific disease categories.
Conclusions
The hypothesis that abstainer biases crucially determine
the shape of the risk relationship between alcohol consump-
tion and mortality is partly supported by our findings. Spe-
cifically, the common practice of including former drinkers
in the abstainer reference group will bias drinking risk
estimates downward, thereby magnifying the appearance of
health benefits from low-level drinking. RR estimates for
former drinkers were consistently high, second only to the
heaviest alcohol consumption category. This is likely because
of individuals giving up drinking for health reasons, which
bias toward shorter life expectancy, whether or not this is re-
lated to their drinking. Evidence for significant bias because
of the inclusion of occasional drinkers with abstainers could
not be confirmed and requires further investigation, as does
the proposal that they replace lifelong abstainers as the most
appropriate reference group for evaluating the risk of drink-
ing in future studies.
It is also noteworthy that in all the pooled models present-
ed, regardless of whether outliers were excluded or study-
level characteristics were controlled for, occasional drinkers
had very similar mortality risks to low-volume drinkers.
This means that if occasional drinkers are considered to be
a more appropriate reference group than lifetime abstainers,
there would be no evidence of health protective effects for
low-volume drinkers or any other category of drinker.
 STOCKWELL ET AL.
197
In summary, our study suggests that a skeptical position
is warranted in relation to the evidence that low-volume
consumption is associated with net health benefits. This con-
clusion is consistent with a recent Mendelian randomization
study that found that a genetic variant associated with re-
duced drinking lowered rather than increased cardiovascular
risk among low-volume drinkers (Holmes et al., 2014). We
recommend that future prospective studies on alcohol and
health minimize bias attributable to the misclassification of
former and occasional drinkers by carefully excluding these
from the abstainer reference group.
Our analyses also indicate that other study quality char-
acteristics need to be addressed, such as the adequacy of
measures of both average daily alcohol consumption and
potentially confounding lifestyle variables. We also recom-
mend that (a) outcomes for occasional drinkers should be
estimated separately from those for low-volume drinkers, (b)
consideration should be given to using occasional drinkers
as the reference group in these prospective observational
studies given evidence that lifetime abstainers have poorer
health for reasons other than their drinking (Ng Fat & Shel-
ton, 2012), (c) following Bergmann et al., drinking behavior
needs to be assessed at multiple time points so that more
stable drinking patterns can be identified and health risks/
benefits more firmly identified, and (d) following Liang and
Chikritzhs (2013), efforts should be made to estimate the
volume and duration of drinking by former drinkers so they
can be correctly classified along with current drinkers for
less biased estimates of risk.
