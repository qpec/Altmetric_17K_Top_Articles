In Brief
Kim et al. compared mitochondrial
features in aging human fibroblasts and
directly induced neurons (iNs). They find
that only iNs display severe signs of
mitochondrial aging defects and show
that the metabolic shift during fibroblast-
to-neuron conversion renders iNs
particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial
aging.

SUMMARY
Mitochondria are a major target for aging and are
instrumental in the age-dependent deterioration
of the human brain, but studying mitochondria in ag-
ing human neurons has been challenging. Direct
fibroblast-to-induced neuron (iN) conversion yields
functional neurons that retain important signs of
aging, in contrast to iPSC differentiation. Here, we
analyzed mitochondrial features in iNs from individ-
uals of different ages. iNs from old donors display
decreased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-
related gene expression, impaired axonal mitochon-
drial morphologies, lower mitochondrial membrane
potentials, reduced energy production, and in-
creased oxidized proteins levels. In contrast, the
fibroblasts from which iNs were generated show
only mild age-dependent changes, consistent with
a
metabolic
shift
from
glycolysis-dependent
fibroblasts
to
OXPHOS-dependent
iNs.
Indeed,
OXPHOS-induced old fibroblasts show increased
mitochondrial aging features similar to iNs. Our data
indicate that iNs are a valuable tool for studying mito-
chondrial aging and support a bioenergetic explana-
tion for the high susceptibility of the brain to aging.
INTRODUCTION
Mitochondria are major generators of energy in our cells, and
their age-related dysfunction is linked to impaired ATP produc-
tion and an increase in oxidative damage (Bratic and Larsson,
2013). Dysfunctional mitochondria are major drivers of cellular
aging and age-related disorders. Aging-related accumulation
of macromolecular damage, including but not limited to mito-
chondrial DNA mutations, leads to increased proportions of
impaired mitochondria within aged cells and tissues (Kujoth
et al., 2005). Mitochondrial dysfunction is characterized by the
loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), which is
directly linked to a loss of energy generated through the electron
transport chain (ETC) that performs oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS); the failure of OXPHOS is believed to set the stage
for the development of age-related disorders (Pickrell et al.,
2011). Interestingly, inherited mitochondrial diseases that can
be caused by mutations in genes encoded on the nuclear
DNA, which encodes the vast majority of mitochondrial genes,
or in genes that are encoded in mtDNA are often associated
with neurodegenerative phenotypes, indicating a particular
vulnerability of brain neurons to mitochondrial defects (Simon
and Johns, 1999). Similarly, the human brain is an organ that is
strongly affected by aging, and advanced age is by far the stron-
gest risk factor for most neurodegenerative disorders (Wyss-
Coray, 2016).
The generation of human neurons through induced pluripotent
stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming and differentiation has been
used
to
model
mitochondrial
disease-related
phenotypes
caused by mutations in nuclear genes (Chung et al., 2016).
Modeling phenotypes caused by mtDNA mutations is more chal-
lenging, as the severity of mtDNA-based diseases is typically
defined by the ratio of mtDNAs that carry the mutation within a
mitochondrion, a phenomenon known as heteroplasmy (Stewart
and Chinnery, 2015). Similarly, the increase of mtDNA mutations
with aging can be recapitulated by investigating several hetero-
plasmic iPSC lines (Kang et al., 2016). However, progressive ag-
ing affects not only mtDNA but also other organelle structures,
nuclear transcriptomics, and several cellular pathways that

 regulate mitochondria. Furthermore, as iPSC reprogramming
erases cellular aging signatures (Miller et al., 2013), including
mitochondrial phenotypes and nuclear transcriptomes (Prigione
et al., 2011; Suhr et al., 2010), the usefulness of iPSCs for study-
ing age-related phenomena that lie beyond DNA mutations is
limited. Therefore, to investigate and link the specific susceptibil-
ity of neurons to aging and mitochondrial dysfunction, a human
neuronal model that integrates known and as-yet-unknown
mitochondrial aging phenotypes would be desirable. Directly
converted induced neurons (iNs) from old human donor-derived
fibroblasts
possess
important
features
of
cellular
aging,
including global transcriptomic changes, nuclear pore defects,
and DNA methylation, rendering them a valuable tool for the
study of age-related neurodegenerative diseases (Huh et al.,
2016; Mertens et al., 2015; Tang et al., 2017). Here, we specif-
ically assessed endogenous human age-dependent mitochon-
drial aging phenotypes in iNs using our previously established
iN system (Mertens et al., 2015).
RESULTS
Old Fibroblast-Derived iNs Show Decreased OXPHOS-
Related Gene Expression
We have previously described the generation and purification of
functional iNs from a cohort of aging human donors ranging in
age from 0 to 89 years. Following at least 3 weeks of conversion,
iN cultures consisted of a major fraction of excitatory neurons
and a minor fraction of inhibitory neurons (Figures S1A–S1C;
Mertens et al., 2015). Throughout this study, and similar to pre-
vious studies, we defined ‘‘young’’ cells as those derived from
human donors younger than 40 years and ‘‘old’’ cells as those
derived from donors aged 40 years and older (Figure 1A; Mertens
et al., 2015). Here, we focused on 1,118 expressed mitochondrial
genes selected based on the Human MitoCarta 2.0 project
(human genes selected for high confidence of mitochondrial
localization based on integrated proteomics, computation, and
microscopy [Calvo et al., 2016]). We found that 70% of all mito-
chondrial genes were downregulated in old iNs compared to
young iNs (Figure 1B). Interestingly, categorization of the mito-
chondrial genes into functional groups revealed that 93% of
the genes that composed the mitochondrial ETC complexes
I–V were downregulated in old iNs (Figure 1C). Also, genes that
related to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the pentose
phosphate pathway (PPP) were downregulated in old iNs,
whereas genes that related to mitochondrial biogenesis or the
pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) were not affected (Fig-
ure 1C). Among the ETC genes, complex I, V, III, and IV genes
were all significantly affected (in that order by significance) (Fig-
ure 1D). Western blot analysis for SDHB (complex II [cII]),
UQCRC2 (cIII), COXII (cIV, mtDNA-encoded), and ATP5A (cV)
confirmed decreased protein levels of these representative
ETC complex factors (Figures 1E and S1D). Furthermore, trans-
lation and transcription of the mtDNA plus-strand-encoded MT-
ND1 were found to be decreased by qPCR and western blot, and
expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) was also
significantly decreased in old iNs (Figures S1E–S1G). These data
indicate that aging alters mitochondrial OXPHOS-related gene
expression and protein abundance in neurons.
iNs from Old Donors Show Impaired Mitochondrial
Function
We next asked whether the observed transcriptional changes
corresponded to functional impairment of mitochondria in old
iNs. Axonal localization of mitochondria is vital to their function,
and reduced axonal densities and the appearance of frag-
mented mitochondria are associated with impaired mitochon-
dria in neurons (Chan, 2012; Sun et al., 2013). Using a lentiviral
MitoEGFP reporter to label mitochondria, we detected signifi-
cantly reduced mitochondrial densities in SMI-312-positive
axons (Figures 2A, 2B, S2A, and S2B). Furthermore, we
observed higher levels of mitochondrial fragmentation, as indi-
cated by reduced mitochondrial length, as well as reduced mito-
chondrial coverage in the axons of old iNs (Figures 2B, S2A, and
S2B). These morphological features are indicative of general
mitochondrial dysfunction in old iNs, so we decided to next
test the mitochondrial MMP, which is known to determine
many mitochondrial functions (Chan, 2012; Mitchell, 1961; Sax-
ton and Hollenbeck, 2012). To measure MMPs specifically in iN
cells, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) anal-
ysis of human synapsin-1 promoter-driven blue fluorescent pro-
tein (hSyn::BFP)-labeled iNs with the green fluorescent cationic
dye JC-1, which accumulates in red fluorescent aggregates in
mitochondria with high MMPs (Figure 2C) (Smiley et al., 1991).
We first gated for the BFP-positive neuronal population (Fig-
ure 2D) and then measured green and red JC-1 fluorescence
in this population (Figure 2E). Young iNs showed significantly
higher MMPs than old iNs, which showed an average 43%
drop (Figure 2F). Next, to test whether this age-dependent
loss of MMP was consequential for the total neuronal energy
levels in young and old iNs, we purified iNs by polysialylated-
neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) FACS and then
measured ATP level in FACS-purified iNs. In line with the gene
expression and morphological and MMP defects, we detected
significantly lower total ATP levels in old neurons (Figure 2G).
Oxyblot analysis revealed significantly increased levels of
oxidized protein damage in old iN cultures, further indicating
mitochondrial defects (Figures 2H and S2C). Furthermore, to
test to what extent neuronal features downstream of mitochon-
dria became impaired in old iNs, we assessed neurite beading
and found that almost 50% of all neurites in old iN cultures
showed axonal varicosities at 6 weeks in culture (Figures S2D
and S2E). Consistently, and as early as 3 weeks in culture,
synaptic transmission gene expression (GO: 0007270) was
significantly decreased in old iNs (Figure S2F). While global anti-
oxidant gene expression profiles of fibroblasts and iNs showed
cell-type-specific differences, the major antioxidant genes
NURR1 (NR4A2) and NRF2 (NFE2L2) did not show obvious
expression differences between the cell types (Figures S2G–
S2J). Interestingly, we found FOXO transcription factor tran-
scripts to be slightly upregulated and FOXO3-repressed genes
to be downregulated in old iNs (Figures S2K and S2L), whereas
HIF1A and its target genes were not changed (Figures S2M and
S2N). Together, these data show that directly converted iNs
from young and old donor fibroblasts reflect broad functional
defects associated with mitochondrial aging and provide a
model to study bioenergetic aspects of human neuronal aging
in vitro.

 iPSC-Derived Neurons from Aging Donors Show No Age-
Related Mitochondrial Defects
Several groups have previously shown that iPSC reprogramming
results in clonal cell lines with rejuvenated mitochondria (Lapas-
set et al., 2011; Prigione et al., 2011; Suhr et al., 2010) and that
iPSC-derived neurons lack age-related phenotypes in general
(Huh et al., 2016; Mertens et al., 2015; Miller et al., 2013; Tang
et al., 2017). To confirm these observations with regard to our
readouts and our present cohort, we analyzed iPSC-derived
neurons from three of our donors (29, 43, and 71 years of age;

 Figure S3A), and consistent with previous data, we observed no
age-dependent transcriptional differences in mitochondrial or
OXPHOS gene expression as determined by RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq) (Figure S3B). Furthermore, OXPHOS protein levels,
mitochondrial morphologies in neurites, MMPs, total ATP levels,
and levels of oxidized proteins were not different between the
29-, 43-, and 71-year-old iPSC-derived neurons (Figures S3C–
S3J). These data confirm the previously described mitochondrial
rejuvenation that follows iPSC differentiation and neuronal
differentiation.
Old Primary Human Fibroblasts Show Only Mild
Mitochondrial Aging Defects
Although both aging- and mutation-caused mitochondrial dys-
functions can cause multi-systemic dysfunctions, the brain is
one of the organs most vulnerable to both aging and inherited
mitochondria-associated diseases. To test this phenomenon in
our model system, we asked to what extent the parental fibro-
blast cultures from which the iNs were derived possessed similar
age-dependent mitochondrial impairments. To our surprise,
RNA-seq analysis of the 12 young and old fibroblast cultures
showed only a slight decrease in the Human MitoCarta 2.0 mito-
chondrial genes (Figure 3A). Overall, mitochondrial gene mRNA
levels decreased 2.3 times less between young and old fibro-
blasts than they did between young and old iNs (Figure 3B).
Similarly, while an age-related decrease of ETC genes was
detectable in fibroblasts, the loss was also 2.3 times less pro-
nounced than in the iN system, and other gene categories did
not show significant age-related changes (Figures 3B and
S4A). No loss of the ETC proteins SDHB, UQCRC2, COXII,
and ATP5A could be detected in old fibroblasts (Figures 3C
and S4B). Next, we performed a morphological analysis of
MTC02 antibody-labeled mitochondria in fibroblasts (Figures
3D, S4C, and S4D), which also revealed no significant age-
dependent
differences
in
mitochondrial
aspect
ratios
or
form factors (Figures 3E, S4C, and S4D). MMP analysis
detected a slight but significant 15% drop in MMP in old fibro-
blasts compared to young fibroblasts that, consistent with the

 transcriptome data, was 2.9 times weaker than the aging effect
measured in iNs from the same donors (Figures 3F and 3G).
Furthermore, while we detected higher levels of oxidized pro-
teins in old fibroblasts than in young ones (Figures 3H and
S4E), measurements of total ATP levels detected no decrease
in old fibroblasts (Figure 3I). Together, these data show that,
although old fibroblast-derived iNs showed severe mitochon-
drial defects, their parental fibroblasts showed only mild age-
related phenotypes. We therefore reasoned that our model
system might recapitulate aspects of the neuronal specificity of
age-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and might be useful
to further explore this phenomenon.
A Metabolic Shift between Fibroblasts and Neurons
toward OXPHOS Underlies the Neuron-Specific
Vulnerability of Mitochondria to Aging
Given that mitochondria showed strong age-dependent defects
in human iNs whereas the same old mitochondria appeared
largely undisturbed in fibroblasts, we asked whether general
bioenergetic differences between the two cell types might
explain this observation. Comparing the expression of metabolic
genes in fibroblasts and iNs, we found that ETC cI–V genes as
well as TCA cycle, PDC, and mitochondrial biogenesis genes
were expressed at higher levels in iNs than in fibroblasts, indi-
cating much higher levels of mitochondrial OXPHOS in iNs

 (Figures 4A and S2). Mitochondrial ribosomal genes are also ex-
pressed at higher levels in iNs, indicating a higher activity of the
mitochondrial transcription and translational machinery (Fig-
ure S4F). In contrast, PPP and glycolysis genes did not show a
clear difference between fibroblasts and iNs (Figure 4A). We
next tested the expression of five representative OXPHOS genes
(SDHB, ATP5F1, NDUFA1, UQCR10, and COX6A1) over the time
course of fibroblast-to-iN conversion (days 3, 6, 12, 18, and
FACS-purified iNs), which revealed a progressive upregulation
of OXPHOS/ETC gene expression during conversion (Figure 4B).
Conversely, the key glycolysis genes ENO1, LDHA, ADH1C, and
HK2 became downregulated in the process, indicating a
decrease in canonical glycolysis in neurons (Figure 4B). To test
the extent to which ATP production in the two cell types de-
pended on mitochondrial OXPHOS, we treated fibroblasts and
FACS-purified iNs with rotenone and antimycin-A (ROT/AA)
and measured total ATP levels after 6 hr. While ATP production
in fibroblasts did not decrease significantly in response to
ROT/AA (Figure 4C), iNs lost 47% of their ATP levels as a result
of the treatment (Figure 4D). As iNs bioenergetically depend
more on mitochondrial OXPHOS whereas fibroblasts derive their
ATP predominantly by performing glycolysis, neuronal mito-
chondria likely display stronger aging phenotypes because of
their increased work burden. We therefore asked whether old fi-
broblasts, when artificially forced to perform OXPHOS, would
show mitochondrial aging phenotypes similar to neurons. To
induce OXPHOS in fibroblasts, the cells were cultured in
glucose-depleted but galactose-containing culture medium for
3 days. Under these conditions, ROT/AA treatment for 6 hr led
to a near-complete loss of the fibroblasts’ ATP, indicating a

 successful induction of OXPHOS and loss of glycolysis (Fig-
ure 4E). We next measured the MMP of old and young
OXPHOS-induced fibroblasts and, indeed, similar to the iNs,
old OXPHOS-induced fibroblasts showed 40% lower MMP
levels than young OXPHOS-induced fibroblasts (Figure 4F).
Consequentially, and similar to the observations in iNs, old
OXPHOS-induced fibroblasts had 33% lower total ATP levels
(Figure 4G). These data indicate that a cell type’s susceptibility
to mitochondrial aging critically depends on the level of OXPHOS
it performs and that the metabolic profile of neurons might render
them particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial aging.
Taken together, our results indicated that fibroblast-derived
iNs showed broad signs of mitochondrial aging, making them
valuable for the study of age-related bioenergetic dysfunctions
directly in human neurons. The data further emphasize the
importance of mitochondrial aging specifically for neuronal cells
and point to a bioenergetic explanation for the type selectivity of
mitochondria-associated cellular dysfunctions.
DISCUSSION
Aging is a degenerative process caused by the accumulation of
macromolecular damage that leads to organelle, cell, and even-
tually tissue dysfunction. Neurons are postmitotic cells born dur-
ing development and have very limited capacity for self-renewal
in the brain over a person’s life span. The age-dependent decline
of neuronal mitochondrial function is one of the major hallmarks
of the aging brain (Payne and Chinnery, 2015). In addition to age-
dependent global transcriptome changes and defects in nucleo-
cytoplasmic shuttling (Mertens et al., 2015), we show here that
iNs directly reprogrammed from primary human skin fibroblasts
derived from old donors displayed typical aspects of human
neuronal mitochondrial aging.
Previous microarray-based transcriptome studies in both ag-
ing rats and aging human prefrontal cortex samples (Lu et al.,
2004) have found that the expression of multiple, nuclear-en-
coded mitochondrial genes gradually declines during aging.
Consistently, old iNs showed decreased expression of more
than two-thirds of all expressed mitochondrial genes (Calvo
et al., 2016) and a specific reduction in OXPHOS-related genes,
which have been considered to impair respiratory function in the
old brain (Manczak et al., 2005). Furthermore, similar to our ob-
servations in iNs, mitochondria in the young rhesus monkey
brain have spheroid elongated tubular structures whereas old
mitochondria often show altered shapes (Hara et al., 2014).
Morphological changes and ATP production loss are typical
signs of dysfunctional mitochondria and are, like most mitochon-
drial functions, controlled by the MMP (Ahmad et al., 2013; Miller
and Sheetz, 2004). Thus, the reduced MMPs in old iNs represent
a major hallmark of bona fide mitochondrial aging in our model
system. Taken together, our results show that old human donor
fibroblast-derived iNs display a broad range of aging signatures
that have been previously described in human post-mortem hu-
man brain samples. iN technology thus represents a valuable
tool to study functional phenotypes of mitochondrial aging in hu-
man neurons.
The human brain consumes up to 20% of the energy used by
the entire human body, more than any other single organ. Mito-
chondrial OXPHOS provides this massive amount of ATP for the
neurons, and the disease- or age-dependent failures of mito-
chondria due to mutations or toxins typically primarily affect
the brain more than other organs (Hall et al., 2012). In our system
of young and old fibroblasts and directly derived young and old
iNs, we observed a similar neuron-specific vulnerability to mito-
chondrial aging. Consistent with our data, it has previously been
shown that, during differentiation of iPSC-derived neural progen-
itors to postmitotic neurons as well as during iN conversion, cells
undergo a metabolic shift from glycolysis to OXPHOS. This
switch proved to be very important for the establishment of
neuronal identity, as neuronal differentiation/conversion failed
when the canonical glycolysis genes LDHA and HK2 were over-
expressed during differentiation (Zheng et al., 2016) or when
OXPHOS was prevented by oligomycin A treatment (Gasco
´ n
et al., 2016). Consistently, LDHA and HK2 became downregu-
lated during iN conversion, and prolonged treatments with
ROT/AA were found to be very toxic to our iNs, further supporting
the view that active OXPHOS is a necessity for human neuronal
identity in vitro. During short-term ROT/AA exposure, however,
iNs appeared to be competent in generating ATP through glycol-
ysis and/or other pathways. This metabolic plasticity might be a
useful mechanism for human neurons to compensate for tempo-
rary oxygen shortage (e.g., stroke) or mitochondrial failure (e.g.,
toxins). However, this plasticity might not be sufficient to
compensate for age-related mitochondrial dysfunction over
long periods of time, whereas optimizing oxygen supply for
OXPHOS appears to be a successful strategy to mitigate age-
dependent cognitive decline (Barnes, 2015). Furthermore,
OXPHOS induction in fibroblasts for only 3 days was sufficient
to reveal age-dependent mitochondrial defects in MMP and
ATP generation similar to iNs. These data suggest that the bioen-
ergetic profile of neurons is the primary reason for the specific
vulnerability of the brain to age-dependent mitochondrial
decline, and we support a model in which mitochondrial aging
defects require a certain threshold of mitochondrial activity
before unfolding. In addition, a temporary overshoot of oxidative
stress that has been described to occur during iN conversion
might further contribute to eliciting mitochondrial defects in
already handicapped old iNs (Gasco
´ n et al., 2016).
We feel that iN technology is both unique and complementary
to iPSC reprogramming paradigms in the study of mitochondrial
aging. Unlike in iNs, each iPSC line is a clonal derivative of one
single fibroblast. Due to the fact that iPSC reprogramming and
expansion are highly selective processes, the generation of het-
eroplasmic iPSC lines from mtDNA disease patients allows com-
parison of ‘‘mutation-rich’’ to ‘‘mutation-free’’ iPSC lines from the
same donor (Fujikura et al., 2012; Inak et al., 2017). While this is a
clear advantage for iPSCs when it comes to the investigation of a
certain mtDNA mutation, such model iPSC lines do not neces-
sarily reflect the genetic state in a patient’s cells (Folmes et al.,
2013; Hatakeyama et al., 2015; Ha
¨ ma
¨ la
¨ inen et al., 2013). In this
current study, iNs have the advantage that they do not involve
a clonal selection process and do not require cell division (Fish-
man et al., 2015; Mertens et al., 2016), so iN cultures can be
expected to reflect the heteroplasmic state of the donor and
most likely also contain other non-mtDNA-related drivers of
mitochondrial aging that are lost during iPSC reprogramming

 and proliferation. This advantage, together with the general tran-
scriptomic retention of age in iNs, renders iNs an interesting hu-
man model system to study neuronal phenotypes that involve
biological aging, including mitochondrial decay.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Further details and an outline of resources used in this work can be found in
Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Direct Conversion of Human Fibroblasts into iNs
iN conversion of primary human dermal fibroblasts was previously described.
Briefly, healthy donor-derived fibroblasts (0–89 years of age) were obtained
from the Coriell Institute Cell Repository, the University Hospital in Erlangen,
and ATCC (Table S1). Protocols were previously approved by the Salk Institute
Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was obtained from all sub-
jects. The fibroblasts were lentivirally transduced to express Ngn2:2A:
Ascl1controlled by a tetOn system. Direct conversion was performed over
3–6 weeks before characterization (Table S2). A more detailed description of
the method can be found in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
MMP Analysis
MMP was assayed using the JC-1 lipophilic cationic dye (Life Technologies).
hSyn::BFP-labeled iNs or fibroblasts were dissociated to single cells using
TrypLE Express, washed twice, resuspended in 1 mL of warm 2 mM JC-1
diluted in the media and incubated at 37�C for 15–20 min. The cells were
washed twice and resuspended in warm PBS, and then the green and red fluo-
rescence of JC-1 dye was quantitated by flow cytometry (LSRII; Becton Dick-
inson). Histogram plots of green and red fluorescence were created to
determine the red/green intensity ratio using FlowJo 10 software (Tree Star).
OXPHOS Induction in Fibroblasts
The fibroblasts were washed twice with PBS, then changed into galactose me-
dia (DMEM deprived of glucose; Invitrogen; 11966-025) supplemented with
5 mM galactose and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells were incubated
for 3 days until harvest.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical values for RNA-seq data were corrected for false-discovery rates
(FDRs) using the Benjamini-Hochberg method implemented in R. Statistical
tests of quantitative data were calculated using GraphPad Prism 7 software
with the method indicated for each figure. Significance evaluation are marked
as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.005, and ****p < 0.001.
