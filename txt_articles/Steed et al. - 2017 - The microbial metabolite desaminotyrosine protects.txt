The microbiota is known to modulate the host response to influenza infection through
as-yet-unclear mechanisms. We hypothesized that components of the microbiota exert
effects through type I interferon (IFN), a hypothesis supported by analysis of influenza
in a gain-of-function genetic mouse model. Here we show that a microbially associated
metabolite, desaminotyrosine (DAT), protects from influenza through augmentation
of type I IFN signaling and diminution of lung immunopathology. A specific human-
associated gut microbe, Clostridium orbiscindens, produced DATand rescued antibiotic-
treated influenza-infected mice. DAT protected the host by priming the amplification
loop of type I IFN signaling. These findings show that specific components of the
enteric microbiota have distal effects on responses to lethal infections through
modulation of type I IFN.
S
ignificant heterogeneity in the host response
to infection likely results from inherited as
well as environmental factors. The enteric
microbiota clearly interacts with the host to
influence immune responses (1–5), possibly
by integrating environmental signals. Influenza
virus pathogenicity is highly influenced by the
microbiota; infection of antibiotic-treated or germ-
free mice results in poor outcomes (6–8). How the
microbiota exerts its protective effects remains
incompletely understood, but we do know that
microbial metabolites modulate a variety of im-
portant systemic phenotypes (5, 9–11). Possibly,
specific microbial metabolites mediate protec-
tion against viral infection.
We focused on type I interferon (IFN) as an
important signaling pathway in viral immunity
in part because increasing evidence shows that
the microbiota can regulate host immune ho-
meostasis, as well as the response to injury and
bacterial infection, through type I IFN signaling
(12). However, its role during in vivo influenza in-
fection remains uncertain, with multiple studies
reporting dichotomous results (13–32). These stud-
ies primarily use loss of function of type I IFN
signaling or administration of high levels of type
I IFN. Given our hypothesis that microbially me-
diated changes in basal type I IFN levels influence
outcomes in response to influenza, we used a
genetic gain-of-function animal model, a mouse
in which the immunity-related guanosine triphos-
phatasefamilyMmember1(Irgm1)isnot expressed
(Irgm1–/– knockout mouse). This model has a
modestbutfunctionallyrelevantthreefoldelevation
in systemic type I IFNs compared with controls
(33) and allows evaluation of the role of augmented
type I IFN signaling before influenza infection.
To confirm that the lungs of Irgm1–/– mice
expressed elevated type I IFNs, we used multiple
assays. First, an IFN-specific varicella zoster vi-
rus infectivity bioassay of whole-lung tissue ho-
mogenate showed elevated type I IFN activity of
Irgm1–/– lungs compared with littermate con-
trols (Fig. 1A). Second, quantitative reverse tran-
scription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
analysis of type I IFN–stimulated genes (ISGs),
Oas2 and Mx2, showed enrichment in Irgm1–/–
lungs (Fig. 1B). Third, analysis of total RNA se-
quencing of control and Irgm1–/– lungs confirmed
a robust signature for elevated type I IFN signaling
(table S1). These assays support the utility of this
model to study host responses to influenza in-
fection in a background of elevated type I IFN in
the lung.
A dose of influenza that caused ~50% mortal-
ity of control mice showed minimal mortality
and weight loss in Irgm1–/– littermates (Fig. 1C
and fig. S1). However, influenza induced similar
mortality and weight loss when these strains
lacked the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) (Fig. 1C
and fig. S1). The lungs of Irgm1–/– mice had sim-
ilar viral loads, kinetics, and viral antigen loca-
lization as controls (Fig. 1D and fig. S2). In contrast,
viraltranscriptswereglobally decreasedinIrgm1–/–
lungs compared with controls (Fig. 1E). Histo-
pathological analysis of Irgm1–/– lungs compared
with controls showed less airway epithelial dam-
age with less apoptosis, a known mechanism of
cell death during influenza infection (34, 35) (Fig. 1,
F to H, and fig. S3). Analysis of RNA sequencing
of lung tissue showed that infected controls had
enhanced enrichment scores for proinflamma-
tory innate immune responses and cell death
pathways compared with infected Irgm1–/– lungs
(table S2). As expected, infected Irgm1–/– lungs
displayed reduced tissue levels of cytokines and
chemokines previously associated with severe in-
fluenza in humans (36), including TNFa, MIP-1,
interleukin-10 (IL-10), MCP-1, and interleukin re-
ceptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) (fig. S4).
The gut microbiota generates many small, dif-
fusible metabolites that enter the systemic cir-
culation (37). We hypothesized that specific
metabolites protect from influenza pathogenesis
by enhancing type I IFN signaling. Therefore, we
screened the effects of 84 microbially associated
metabolites (38) using a reporter cell line that
harbors multiple type I IFN response elements
(39). Each metabolite was screened for its in-
duction of type I IFN signaling with polyinosinic-
polycytidylic acid [poly(IC), a structural analog of
double-stranded RNA] or amplification of type I
IFN pathways with IFN-b treatment (fig. S5).
We identified 11 metabolites that reproducibly
increased reporter activity with either poly(IC)
or type I IFN treatment (Fig. 2A). Three metabo-
litesshowed dose-dependent increases in reporter
activity (Fig. 2B and fig. S6). Note that the level of
activity was comparable to that found in high-
throughput screens with this reporter for current
drug discovery and design (39).
One of these metabolites, desaminotyrosine
(DAT), is potentially biologically relevant. DAT is
a degradation product of flavonoids (40, 41),
which comprise a group of polyphenolic com-
pounds enriched in certain foods (42). Addition-
ally, human enteric bacteria produce DAT from
flavonoids and amino acid metabolism (40, 41, 43),
and flavonoids have been proposed to exert im-
munoregulatory effects (44). In our facility,
wild-type mice produce nanomoles of DAT per
gram of feces and have picomolar quantities of
DAT in the serum. By contrast, mice treated for
2 weeks with vancomycin, neomycin, ampicillin,
and metronidazole (VNAM) had no fecal DAT and
markedly reduced serum levels (Fig. 2C). Groups
of mice were pretreated with VNAM followed by
either 200 mM DAT or vehicle in drinking water
for 1 week; concomitant treatment with oral DAT
and systemic poly(IC) enhanced serum type I IFN
activity (Fig. 2D). DAT treatment alone increased
the expression of multiple ISGs in the lungs
(Fig. 2E), potentially by augmenting production
of type I IFN in response to ubiquitous viruses
found in mice (45).
Groups of mice with or without VNAM pre-
treatment were given 200 mM DAT or vehicle in
drinking water 7 days before influenza infection
and throughout infection for 14 days. Consistent
with prior findings (6–8), antibiotic-treated mice
showed increased mortality and weight loss com-
pared with non–antibiotic-treated mice (Fig. 3A
and figs. S7 and S8). Influenza-associated mor-
tality and weight loss were less in DAT-treated
mice compared with controls (Fig. 3A and figs. S7

 to S9). Consistent with our hypothesis that DAT
protects from influenza infection by enhancing
type I IFN signaling before infection, DAT con-
ferred no beneficial effect on weight loss or sur-
vival in Ifnar–/– animals (Fig. 3B and fig. S10).
DATprotectionwasnotH1N1WSN strain–specific,
as mice infected with PR8 and California/09 were
protected by DAT (fig. S11).
We hypothesized that augmentation of type I
IFN activity by DAT protects mice via a mecha-
nism similar to that found in the Irgm1–/– mice.
Indeed, DAT protection was not associated with
a difference in viral titers 5 days postinfection
(Fig. 3C), but we found less viral RNA in the
lungs of mice treated with DAT than in controls
(Fig. 3D). Similar to our findings in the Irgm1–/–
gain-of-function model, greater airway epithelial
damage and apoptosis were observed in con-
trol lungs than in DAT-treated mice (Fig. 3, E
to G). These findings show that DAT also dam-
pens host damage associated with influenza
infection.
DAT generation occurs during flavonoid metab-
olism, and specific microbiota species metabo-
lize flavonoids (46). A limited screen of the human
fecal microbiota for flavonoid metabolism to DAT
identified Clostridium orbiscindens (41) (Fig. 3H).
Note that clostridial species are sensitive to met-
ronidazole and vancomycin (47), the individual
antibiotics that enhanced influenza-associated

 mortality (fig. S12). To investigate the role of spe-
cific bacteria in DAT generation and ultimate-
ly influenza protection, we obtained isolates of
C. orbiscindens, C. leptum (a related bacterium),
and Enterococcus faecalis (an unrelated microbiota
member sensitive to vancomycin). Consistent with
prior studies, we found that C. orbiscindens de-
graded flavonoid substrates effectively (Fig. 3H).
Mouse cecal contents containing multiple pro-
karyote species also degraded the flavonoid sub-
strate, albeit less effectively than pure cultures
of C. orbiscindens (Fig. 3H). In contrast, other
vancomycin-sensitive species, C. leptum and
E. faecalis, did not degrade flavonoids (Fig. 3H).
We gavaged groups of VNAM-pretreated mice

protected mice from influenza mortality and mor-

 DAT levels, whereas C. leptum and E. faecalis did
not (Fig. 3J).
Pretreating mice with DAT for 1 week before
influenza infection, followed by cessation of
treatment at the time of infection, protected
mice from mortality and weight loss similarly
to mice continuously treated (Fig. 4A and fig. S14).
However, administration of DAT starting 2 days
postinfection led to a worse outcome than for mice
who never received DAT (Fig. 4A and fig. S14).
This finding suggests that priming of the immune
system by DAT before infection is protective.
Consistent with this idea, Irgm1–/–;Rag1–/– mice,
which maintain elevated levels of type I IFN,
showed protection compared with Rag1–/– mice
(fig. S15), and this implies that innate, not adapt-
ive, immunity is crucial for the protective priming
effect of type I IFN.
Within the lung, phagocytes are essential me-
diators of innate immune responses to bacterial
and viral pathogens (48). To determine whether
type I IFN mediates protection from influenza
infection through a phagocytic-dependent mech-
anism, we treated mice systemically with clod-
ronate liposomes to deplete lung phagocytes (49)
(fig. S16). Clodronate treatment also abolished
DAT- and Irgm1–/–-mediated protection (Fig. 4,
B and C, and fig. S17). These results indicate that
phagocytes are required for type I IFN–mediated
protection from influenza infection.
Similarly to lung homogenates, influenza viral
RNA was depleted in DAT-treated and Irgm1–/–
bone-marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs)
in an Ifnar-dependent manner (Fig. 4D). DAT-
pretreated BMDMs showed increased ISG tran-
scripts after in vitro influenza infection, in an
Ifnar-dependent manner (Fig. 4E). Similarly, ISG
transcript abundance increased when DAT treat-
ment was combined with either poly(IC) or type I
IFN (Fig. 4, F and G).
Our initial validation of DAT did not discern
between augmentation of type I IFN induction
or type I IFN amplification. To clarify where DAT
exerts its effects, BMDMs were isolated from mice
genetically deficient in key mediators of type I
IFN induction and amplification. To query the
upstream induction pathway, we isolated BMDMs
from Mavs–/– mice and found that DAT still en-
hanced poly(IC) and type I IFN expression of
interferon-g–induced protein 10 (IP-10) (Fig. 4, F
and G). Therefore, we conclude that DAT is less
likely to act in the induction pathway than in the
amplification loop. To confirm this, we examined
the role of STAT1, a signaling molecule down-
stream of IFNAR. IP-10 expression was not en-
hanced in similarly treated BMDMs from Stat1–/–
mice (Fig. 4, F and G). This finding was confirmed
with the STAT1 inhibitor, fludarabine (fig. S18).
Taken together, these findings indicate that DAT
augmentation of type I IFN signaling is mediated
by IFN amplification via IFNAR and STAT1.
Our findings that preexisting members of the
human microbiota protect the host from influ-
enza infection may have implications for the
known heterogeneous response to this infection
in humans. Our results suggest that prior colo-
nization by specific bacteria and a flavonoid-
enriched diet are key components that modulate
the immune response to influenza infection. Given
that DAT offers a protective priming of the im-
mune system, our findings also indicate the im-
portance of timing in the ensuing overall immune
response.
