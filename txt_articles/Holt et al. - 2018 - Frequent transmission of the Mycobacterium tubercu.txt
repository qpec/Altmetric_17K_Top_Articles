Abstract
To examine transmission dynamics of Mtb isolated from TB patients in Ho Chi Minh City, 
Vietnam we sequenced whole genomes of 1,635 isolates and compared these with 3,144 isolates 
from elsewhere. The data reveal an underlying burden of disease caused by endemic Mtb Lineage 
1 associated with activation of long-term latent infection, and a three-fold higher burden associated 
with more recently introduced Beijing lineage and Lineage 4 Mtb strains. We find that Beijing 
lineage Mtb is frequently transferred between Vietnam and other countries, and detect higher 
levels of transmission of Beijing lineage strains within this host population than endemic Lineage 
1 Mtb. Screening for parallel evolution of Beijing lineage-associated SNPs in other Mtb lineages 
as a signal of positive selection, we identify a mutation in the ESX-5 type VII secreted protein 
EsxW, which could potentially contribute to the enhanced transmission of Beijing lineage Mtb in 
Vietnamese and other host populations.
Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death from infectious disease and the global burden 
is now higher than at any point in history1,2. Despite coordinated efforts to control TB 
transmission, the factors contributing to its successful spread remain poorly understood. 
Vietnam is identified as one of 30 high burden countries for TB and MDR-TB with an 
incidence of 137 TB cases per 100,000 individuals in 20152. Recent phylogenomic analyses 
of the causative agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in other high-prevalence regions 
have provided insights into the complex processes underlying TB transmission3–5.
Results
Genetic diversity and drug resistance
To characterize the diversity of Mtb circulating in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), we 
sequenced the genomes of 1,635 isolates (Supplementary Table 1) obtained from 2,091 HIV 
uninfected, smear positive adults (≥18 years) commencing anti-TB therapy at district TB 
units (DTUs) in eight districts of HCMC between December 2008 and July 2011 (see 
Methods). This identified 73,718 SNPs, which we used to reconstruct a maximum likelihood 
phylogeny (Fig. 1a) and to assign lineages6. The majority of isolates (n=957, 59%) belonged 
to lineage 2.2.1, a subgroup of the Beijing lineage (2.2). Lineage 1 (Indo-Oceanic lineage;

 n=388, 23.7%) and Lineage 4 (Euro-American lineage; n=192, 11.7%) were also common. 
A single isolate belonged to Lineage 3 (East African-Indian lineage) and was excluded from 
further analysis. The distribution of lineages did not change during the 2.5-year period of 
study (Fig. 1b), and was in agreement with previous genotyping studies in urban areas of 
Vietnam (≥50% 2.2/Beijing lineage and ~20% Lineage 1.1/EIA in Hanoi and HCMC, 
1998-2009)7–11. Known antimicrobial resistance mutations were detected in all lineages but 
were more frequent in Beijing sublineage 2.2.1 (Table 1), consistent with earlier reports 
from Vietnam7–9,11. In particular, Beijing sublineage 2.2.1 was enriched for mutations 
associated with resistance to streptomycin (OR 4.6 [95% CI 3.6-6.0], p=1×10-15), isoniazid 
(OR 1.7 [1.3-2.1], p=3×10-5), rifampicin (OR 5.4 [2.5-13.2], p=1×10-7) and ethambutol (OR 
5.6 [2.6-13.7], p=1×10-7), using Fisher’s exact test to compare to all non-2.2.1 Mtb isolates.
Mtb lineage and host demographics
Whilst the majority of TB patients were male (74%, typical for TB studies in Vietnam and 
elsewhere8–10,12), the Beijing sublineage was significantly associated with TB in females 
(OR 1.28 [95% CI 1.01-1.62], p=0.043 using Fisher’s exact test; Table 1), consistent with 
prior observations in Vietnam8 and Nepal13. Beijing sublineage 2.2.1 was also significantly 
associated with younger people: its frequency declined with age, from 74% of cases in <20 
year olds to 50% in ≥60 year olds (p=0.0023 Fisher’s exact test, p=0.0024 linear trend test; 
Fig. 1c). In contrast, Lineage 1 was significantly associated with males (25% of male cases 
vs 19% of females, p=0.017) and increased with age regardless of gender, from 12% in <20 
year olds to 35% in ≥60 year olds (p=0.0007 Fisher’s exact test, p=0.0014 linear trend test; 
Fig. 1c). These data confirm that Beijing sublineage 2.2.1 is capable of causing active 
disease in a wider demographic range of the Vietnamese host population, particularly among 
females and younger people, than the endemic Lineage 17–10, which is associated with the 
more typical profile of TB susceptibility that is skewed towards males [M:F prevalence ratio 
for smear-positive TB was recently estimated at 2.5 (95% CI 2.07–3.04), based on 40 
surveys in 22 countries12] and older people2,14.
Mtb lineages display distinct local transmission dynamics
We hypothesised that Beijing lineage or sublineage 2.2.1 was more transmissible than 
Lineage 1, and/or more capable of causing active disease in infected hosts, in the local 
Vietnamese Kinh host population. To investigate this, we used the whole genome phylogeny 
to compare diversity metrics for each lineage (Fig. 2). Terminal branch lengths, which 
represent an upper bound of evolutionary time since transmission for each Mtb case, were 
significantly shorter for Beijing sublineage 2.2.1 Mtb isolates (median 8 SNPs) than for non-
Beijing lineage isolates (Lineage 1: median 53 SNPs, p<1×10-15 using Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test; Lineage 2.1: 30 SNPs, p<1×10-6; Lineage 4: 17 SNPs, p<1×10-9), and slightly 
shorter than Beijing sublineage 2.2.2 isolates (9 SNPs, p=0.02) (Fig. 2a). The distribution of 
mean node-to-tip distances for all internal nodes was skewed significantly lower within the 
Beijing sublineage 2.2.1 compared to the rest of the tree (median 16 SNPs compared to 62, 
57, 39 and 60 SNPs for Lineages 1, 2.1, 2.2.2 and 4, respectively; p<0.0015 in all cases).
To better understand the differences in transmission dynamics, we explored the distribution 
of potential transmission clusters using a range of maximum pairwise SNP distance

 thresholds to define a cluster15 (Fig. 2b-c). Using the smallest cut-off of five SNPs 
(transmission age of <5 years) there were n=109 clusters, of which 76 (70%) belonged to 
Beijing sublineage 2.2.1; these had a mean size of 2.4 strains per cluster, compared to mean 
2.1 for other clusters (Fig. 2b-c). Using cut-offs of 10 and 20 SNPs there were n=164 and 
n=220 clusters, respectively; of these, 118 (72%) and 156 (71%), respectively, were Beijing 
2.2.1 and these showed significantly larger cluster sizes (means, 2.5 and 3.2 strains per 
cluster) than those of other lineages (means, 2.2 and 2.4). Notably, the proportion of cases 
that belonged to transmission clusters was significantly lower amongst Lineage 1 cases 
(7.7% at the 10 SNP threshold) compared to Lineage 4 cases (20.3%, p=2×10-5), which in 
turn was significantly lower than among Beijing lineage cases (31.5%, p=3×10-3; see Fig. 
2b). Therefore sublineage 2.2.1 infections were more likely to result from recent detectable 
transmission within the local population, despite our study having low power to detect recent 
transmission due to sampling only a small fraction of all incident cases in HCMC (~30% of 
those in the study districts, <10% across HCMC, and restricted to new cases of smear-
positive, culture-positive HIV-negative TB only; see Methods). Household data was not 
available; however pairs of TB cases whose infecting Mtb strains were separated by ≤10 or 
≤20 SNPs were significantly more likely to be diagnosed in the same DTU than more 
distantly related pairs of the same lineage (27% or 21%, vs 15% amongst strains separated 
by >20 SNPs; p<1×10-12, see Supplementary Figure 1). This phenomenon was observed for 
both Beijing 2.2.1 and non-Beijing clusters, but the effect was significantly less for the 
Beijing lineage (of strain pairs separated by <20 SNPs, 21% of Beijing pairs vs 29% of non-
Beijing pairs were diagnosed in the same DTUs; p=0.036, see Supplementary Figure 1), 
suggesting they may be more readily transmitted across greater geographical distances 
within HCMC than other Mtb. This could potentially be associated with the higher 
frequency of Beijing lineage TB amongst younger adults (Fig. 1c), who may be more likely 
to travel regularly between districts, promoting onward transmission; however the age 
distribution amongst transmission clusters did not differ by lineage. Taken together, the 
phylogenomic data reveal significant differences in transmission dynamics between the 
various Mtb lineages circulating in HCMC, and suggest that newly diagnosed cases of 
Lineage 1 Mtb in this population often result from activation of longer-term latent infections 
with many private SNPs and no evidence of recent transmission, whilst new cases of Beijing 
sublineage 2.2.1 Mtb often result from more recent transmission and shorter time to develop 
active disease.
Geographical relationships of Vietnamese Mtb strains
It has been suggested that the Beijing lineage is slowly displacing the resident Lineage 1 
strains in Vietnam, following the introduction of the Beijing strain into urban areas and 
subsequent spread to rural areas where Lineage 1 still dominates8,10. Our data are 
consistent with this, showing a higher frequency of Beijing lineage (65%) amongst Mtb 
infections in HCMC in 2008-2011 compared to the frequencies reported in the city a decade 
earlier7 (53% in 1998), or in rural areas outside the city8 (32-37% in 2003-2005). We 
therefore hypothesized that Beijing 2.2.1 isolates from HCMC may represent a locally 
established epidemic subclade of the Beijing lineage, similar to that previously described in 
Russia3. To investigate this we combined our HCMC Mtb genome data with 3,146 publicly 
available Mtb whole genome sequences from Russia3, Malawi4,5, Argentina16, and

 China17; and globally dispersed Lineage 1 and 2 genomes18,19,20 (Supplementary Table 
2); then inferred phylogenies for each lineage (Fig. 3). HCMC Lineage 1 strains were quite 
distinct from those in other locations (Fig. 3a), with little evidence of transfer between 
Vietnam and other regions. The vast majority (n=319, 82%) belonged to a localised subclade 
(1.1.1.16) that included only seven previously sequenced strains, all of which were from 
Vietnam. A further 46 (12%) of the HCMC strains belonged to a related sister clade (1.1.1) 
which also included strains from neighbouring Cambodia (n=1) and Thailand (n=2); the 
remainder (n=23, 6%) belonged to subclade 1.2.1, in which the HCMC strains were 
intermingled with others from the Philippines (n=9) and China (n=1). These data suggest 
that Lineage 1 associated TB in HCMC results mainly from a local endemic Mtb population. 
In contrast, Beijing 2.2.1 isolates from HCMC formed several distinct clusters that each 
shared a recent common ancestor with isolates from outside Vietnam (Fig. 3b). Notably, 
isolates from Russia, Malawi, China and numerous other countries were interspersed 
throughout the HCMC Beijing 2.2.1 population (Fig 3b), suggesting multiple, frequent 
transfers between host populations in HCMC and other geographic regions. HCMC Lineage 
4 isolates were drawn from eight of the ten recognised sublineages6 (including those 
identified as specialist, generalist and intermediate in their geographic range21) and were 
interspersed with isolates from other geographical locations, consistent with multiple 
imports into HCMC (Fig. 3c). In further support of these observations, stochastic mapping 
of locations onto the phylogenies predicted dozens of strain transfer events between Vietnam 
and other locations for Lineages 2 and 4, but not for Lineage 1 (Fig. 3d), strongly supporting 
that Mtb sublineage 1.1.1.1 is endemic in Vietnam.
Beijing lineage-defining SNPs under positive selection
The population structure (Figs 1-2) provides evidence that Beijing lineage strains are more 
transmissible within this HIV-negative HCMC population than are other Mtb lineages. 
Genomic evidence for enhanced transmission of the Beijing lineage has been documented in 
Russia (associated with antimicrobial resistance)3 and Malawi (independent of antimicrobial 
resistance)4. While antimicrobial resistance was common amongst HCMC Beijing lineage 
isolates, the majority of transmission clusters (defined by ≤10 SNPs) comprised groups of 
isolates that did not share any known resistance mutations that could account for their 
transmission success (Supplementary Figure 2). This is consistent with previous reports that 
the Beijing lineage is highly transmissible and more likely to progress to active disease in 
various host populations and is also more virulent and less pro-inflammatory in various 
cellular assays, independent of antimicrobial resistance22–25. We therefore aimed to 
interrogate the Mtb genome data to identify mutations that may contribute to the success of 
the Beijing lineage (2.2). Evolutionary convergence has previously been used as a signal of 
positive selection to identify mutations associated with antimicrobial resistance in Mtb26,27. 
We reasoned that advantageous polymorphisms contributing to the enhanced transmissibility 
of Lineage 2.2 should be fixed in this lineage, and should also be under positive selection 
that is detectable as convergent or parallel evolution at the same variant sites in other 
lineages. We identified a total of 424 homoplasic nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) across the 
HCMC phylogeny. The most frequent of these occurred in genes in which convergent 
evolution has previously been associated with antimicrobial resistance including gidB, 
embB, gyrA, rpoB, and inhA26, which together accounted for 12.4% of all homoplasic

 nsSNPs. The distribution of common homoplasic nsSNPs in these genes is shown in 
Supplementary Figure 3; in particular, rifampicin resistance-associated mutations in rpoB 
and ethambutol-associated mutations in embB arose independently many times in Beijing 
sublineage 2.2.1 (n=33/35 rpoB-450 mutations; n=16/17 embB-306 mutations; n=8/10 
embB-406 mutations). The homoplasic nsSNPs included three that arose on the branch 
defining Lineage 2.2 and also elsewhere in the HCMC tree (Table 2, Supplementary Figure 
4). One was a mutation in esxW (Rv3620c) codon 2 (EsxW-Thr2Ala), which arose on nine 
other branches (six times in Lineage 4, three times in Lineage 1; see Supplementary Figure 
4) and showed evidence of onward transmission on 4/9 occasions. Comparison to the global 
tree detected the same esxW mutation on a further ten Lineage 4 branches in Malawi and 
Russia, with onward transmission detected on 6/10 occasions. The other two mutations were 
in Rv3081 (conserved hypothetical protein) and gidB (mutations in which are often 
associated with streptomycin resistance) and arose less frequently (Table 2). In contrast, 
homoplasic nsSNPs on the branches defining Lineages 1 or 4 were each detected on only 
1-2 other branches in the HCMC tree and no additional branches of the global tree 
(Supplementary Table 3). No homoplasic SNPs were associated with sublineage 2.2.1, and 
although synonymous or intergenic SNPs can have functional consequences, we found no 
such homoplasies associated with Beijing or other lineages.
EsxW mutation
EsxW is included in multiple Mtb vaccines currently under development (including H65, 
ID83, ID93)28–31 due to its demonstrated immunogenicity in mice, safety and 
immunogenicity in non-human primates31, demonstrated T-cell targeting in humans32, and 
epitopes predicted to bind a wide range of human HLA-DRB1 alleles28,33. Hence we 
considered whether the EsxW-Thr2Ala mutation could affect epitope binding. However, 
residue two lies in the N-terminal loop of EsxW (see Fig. 4e), outside the experimentally 
demonstrated epitope region (residues 24-34)34. In silico epitope binding analysis on the 
Beijing and non-Beijing EsxW protein sequences using the Immune Epitope Database 
Analysis Resource35 predicted HLA binding to the first 9-10 residues of EsxW, but no 
differences in binding affinities for the wildtype and Thr2Ala mutant alleles. This is 
consistent with experimental data showing that immunization with ID93 (a recombinant 
fusion protein containing H37Rv (Lineage 4) wildtype alleles of EsxW/V) is protective 
against Beijing (2Ala) as well as non-Beijing (2Thr) strains30,31.
Next we considered whether the EsxW-Thr2Ala mutation could impact on gene expression 
or protein structure and function. esxW is one of 23 esx genes in the Mtb genome, including 
11 clustered pairs of esx genes whose products form heterodimers that are each secreted by 
one of five type VII secretion systems (T7SS; ESX-1 to ESX-5). The most-studied of these 
pairs is esxB (CFP10)/esxA (ESAT-6), secreted by ESX-1 and encoded in the RD1 locus 
which also encodes the ESX-1 system. EsxW and its heterodimerization partner EsxV are 
encoded by adjacent genes in the RD8 locus and secreted by ESX-5. The ESX-5 system is 
the most recently evolved T7SS in Mtb and is present only in the slow-growing 
Mycobacteria36,37 (including the Mtb complex, M. leprae, M. ulcerans and M. marinum). 
ESX-5 is unique amongst the Mtb T7SS in that (a) it secretes most of the PE/PPE 
proteins38, which are also unique to slow-growing Mycobacteria, comprise a substantial

 amount of protein coding capacity (~10%) in the Mtb genome and play various roles in 
virulence39,40; and (b) it is associated with five pairs of Esx proteins, resulting from 
duplication and expansion of esxM and esxN (which are encoded within the locus encoding 
the ESX-5 T7SS machinery) to create four paralogous copies elsewhere in the Mtb 
genome41 (Fig. 4). Each pair includes a member of the QILSS family (EsxM paralog, 
including EsxW) and a member of the Mtb9.9 family (EsxN paralog, including EsxV), 
which partner to form heterodimers. The paralogous proteins differ from one another by just 
a few amino acids (Fig. 4b), and the reason for this apparent redundancy is not clear. One 
pair, EsxJ/EsxI, has been shown to play a role in substrate selection for ESX-5 secretion42, 
and it is hypothesized that the other paralogs including EsxW/V play a similar role41. 
Notably, two of the loci encoding QILSS paralogs (EsxP/O, RD5; and EsxW/V, RD8) are 
missing from the M. bovis BCG vaccine strain.
The upstream sequences of esxW and its homologs differ substantially (Fig. 4a). This 
suggests their expression is subject to different regulatory controls, which could provide a 
reason for their expansion in the Mtb genome despite the lack of differentiation at the 
protein level43 (Fig. 4b); indeed, it has been shown that the different QILSS family 
members are all expressed at different levels by Mtb strain H37Rv during growth in broth, 
sputum and macrophages44. This uniqueness also allows unambiguous read mapping and 
confident SNP calling at the N-terminal region of EsxW; however we also used PCR and 
capillary sequencing to confirm the EsxW-2Ala allele in all non-Lineage 2 strains in which 
the SNP was identified from Illumina reads (see Methods). We sought to investigate the 
expression of QILSS family proteins, and the potential impact of the EsxW-Thr2Ala 
mutation on gene expression, during growth in macrophages. For these experiments we 
selected four non-Beijing Mtb isolates harbouring the EsxW-2Ala allele, and the closest 
genetic relative of each with the wildtype allele EsxW-2Thr, and used RNAseq to measure 
genome-wide Mtb expression levels (see Methods). The results showed that the ESX-5 
system was highly expressed in all isolates following 24h growth in macrophages (mean 
0.25% of total Mtb RNAseq reads); however the QILSS paralogs were expressed at different 
levels relative to ESX-5 (Fig. 4c). Compared to esxM, which is encoded within the ESX-5 
locus itself and was expressed at the highest levels in all isolates, esxK and esxP were 
expressed at intermediate levels (mean 42% of esxM level) and esxJ and esxW were 
expressed at low levels (mean 2.2% of esxM level). There were no significant differences 
between the EsxW-2Ala mutant vs wildtype in terms of Mtb growth in macrophages 
(measured at 4, 7 or 11 days post-infection), or in esxW (Fig. 4d), ESX-5 or global gene 
expression measured at 24h post-infection. It has been reported that esxW was significantly 
expressed in the lungs of Mtb aerosol-infected mice45; hence future experiments with 
wildtype and mutant EsxW in this animal system could potentially help to unravel its 
functional effects.
Given the proposed role for the EsxW/V heterodimer in substrate selection for ESX-5 
secretion41, we investigated whether the EsxW-Thr2Ala mutation could affect protein 
structure and function. In M. canetti, the reference Mtb genome H37Rv, and the majority of 
non-Beijing Mtb isolates, EsxW carries the polar threonine (codon ACC) at residue 2, while 
the other QILSS proteins in the Mtb complex and other slow growing Mycobacteria carry 
the hydrophobic alanine (GCC) at this position (Fig. 4b). In the Mtb Beijing lineage, EsxW

 residue 2 is converted to the more typical residue alanine (GCC), making it identical at the 
protein level to EsxJ, which has been shown to be involved in substrate selection for ESX-5 
secretion42. We analysed the quantitative effects of the Thr2Ala mutation on the stability 
and affinity of the EsxW protomer and the EsxW/V heterodimer, using computational 
modeling and direct biophysical experiments (see Methods and Fig. 4e). This indicated that 
the 2Ala mutation was likely to lead to a mild increase in the affinity and stability of the 
heterodimer complex (mean ΔΔG 0.28±0.06 Kcal/mol), and this was supported by 
biophysical measurements that showed the mutant bound slightly stronger to EsxV than the 
wildtype (KDwt=0.6 µM; KDT2A=0.4 µM; p=0.05 using two-tailed t-test; Fig. 4f). We 
hypothesise that, if EsxW/V does indeed play a role in substrate selection for ESX-5 
secretion, then increased stability of the heterodimer and/or the hydrophobicity of 
EsxW-2Ala could potentially affect the efficiency of secretion of certain PE/PPE proteins. 
This could thereby have downstream impacts on one or more of the known functions of 
ESX-5 including inflammasome activation, IL-1β secretion or escape from macrophages46, 
any of which could potentially work to promote transmission between hosts.
Discussion
The shorter terminal branch lengths and node-to-tip distances for local Beijing lineage Mtb 
(Fig 2) could be explained by (i) a slower mutation rate in the Beijing lineage, resulting in 
slower accumulation of SNPs over time; (ii) sampling bias, whereby new cases of active TB 
arising in the study population were more likely to be detected and included in the study if 
they were caused by Beijing lineage strains; or (iii) strain-specific transmission dynamics in 
the study population, whereby the average time taken to progress to active disease is shorter 
for Beijing lineage than for other Mtb strains. The mutation rate for Mtb has been estimated 
at ~0.5 SNPs per year for Lineage 4, and ~2x faster for Beijing strains47 (Lineage 1 has not 
been specifically measured but is assumed to be similar to Lineage 4, which is considered 
typical). Hence if all Mtb lineages were subject to the same transmission dynamics within 
the study area, we would expect to see longer terminal branch lengths for Beijing lineage 
isolates, whereas here we observe the opposite (significantly shorter branch lengths). 
Patients were recruited into the study following positive diagnosis at eight central DTUs in 
HCMC (map in Supplementary Figure 5). The identity of the infecting Mtb lineages was not 
known at the time of recruitment, and we are unaware of any factors that would bias the 
inclusion of Beijing lineage cases over others presenting to the clinics for treatment; hence 
we conclude the frequency of infections with Beijing strains, and their shorter branch 
lengths, reflect differences in the transmission dynamics of these strains within the study 
population.
The lack of transfer of Mtb sublineage 1.1.1.1 between Vietnam and other geographical 
locations (Fig 3) may be associated with adaptation to the local host population with which 
it has co-evolved for centuries, similar to the ‘host-specialist’ clades recently identified 
within Lineage 421. In contrast, whilst the direction of transfer of Lineage 2.2.1 strains 
between HCMC and other geographical regions cannot be determined from our data, the 
frequency of transfer events and the scale of diversity amongst the HCMC strains (Fig 3) 
makes it unlikely that the rise of Beijing sublineage 2.2.1 in HCMC represents clonal spread 
of a locally established subclade. Regardless of direction, the frequency of transfer between

 Vietnam and diverse geographically dispersed populations supports previous contentions 
that the Beijing lineage is a host-generalist, capable of moving between ethnically diverse 
host populations24.
While the mechanism remains to be elucidated, our results provide evidence that the Beijing 
lineage carries a variant of esxW that is under positive selection in natural Mtb populations. 
This is consistent with the idea that the protein is important for host interactions, potentially 
through substrate selection for ESX-5 secretion under certain conditions. Immunizing 
against EsxW has already been shown to be protective against infection29–32, and positive 
selection for this protein suggests vaccines including it are likely to remain effective in the 
long term.
Taken together, our data show that the burden of TB in HCMC comprises (i) an underlying 
burden of disease caused by endemic Lineage 1 Mtb strains (24% of all TB cases), which 
disproportionately affects men and older people and is associated more with activation of 
long-term latent infection than short-term transmission clusters; and (ii) an additional 
disease burden caused by more recently introduced Lineage 2 and 4 Mtb strains (76% of all 
TB cases). In particular, Beijing sublineage 2.2.1 was associated with a wider demographic 
host range, infecting women and young people significantly more frequently than other 
lineages, and was associated with shorter time to active disease and frequent onward local 
transmission. One third of all Beijing strains were involved in transmission clusters (≤10 
SNPs), and these were associated with wider geographic dispersal within HCMC. Notably, 
75% of TB cases associated with transmission clusters involved the Beijing lineage, 
accounting for 20% of all cases included in the genomic study.
Importantly, these data show that not all Mtb are equal: genetically diverse strains display 
distinct transmission dynamics even within a single localized host population, suggesting 
that more detailed understanding of lineage-specific variation in Mtb could be informative to 
tailor local TB control in HCMC and other settings. For example, TB contact tracing is 
commonly used in low-incidence high-income countries, but results vary in high-incidence 
low- and middle-income countries and there is a need to prioritize resources towards cases 
where contact tracing is most likely to yield results, which includes considering the 
likelihood of transmission and progression to active disease within the time frame of a 
contact tracing program (1-2 years)48,49. In HCMC it may thus be advantageous to direct 
contact tracing resources towards Beijing lineage cases, as they pose the greatest risk of 
onward transmission resulting in new active TB cases.
Online Methods
Bacterial isolates used in this study
Between December 2008 and July 2011, 2,091 individuals of the Vietnamese Kinh ethnic 
group attending the outpatient department of Pham Ngoc Thach Hospital or from 8 District 
Tuberculosis Units (District 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, Tan Binh, Binh Thanh and Phu Nhuan) in HCMC 
were recruited into a clinical study investigating predictors of failure and relapse in isoniazid 
resistant TB 50. The 8 TB units were chosen for inclusion from amongst the 24 servicing 
HCMC as they are centrally located and close to the TB reference laboratory, which was

 essential for the logistics of sample collection and processing (see map in Supplementary 
Figure 5). Inclusion criteria were: (1) 18 years or older, (2) negative HIV test, (3) provision 
of written informed consent, (4) smear positive pulmonary TB. Exclusion criteria were: (1) 
under 18 years of age, (2) HIV infected, (3) unable or unwilling to provide consent, (5) 
pregnancy, (6) prior history of TB antibiotic therapy, (7) will receive TB-DOTS (directly 
observed treatment, short-course) outside the study centres. Over the 2.5 year study period 
there were N=5036 new smear positive cases of TB (HIV positive and negative) at the 
district tuberculosis units, of which N=2091 were eligible for recruitment. Of these, N=1822 
Mtb strains were isolated from the study participants. The annual incidence of pulmonary 
TB in HCMC is ~82,000, of which ~11,000 are in HCMC; therefore our sample represents 
~6.6% of all cases in HCMC during the 2.5-year study period, and >30% of cases in the 
study districts.
Ethics
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Research Board of Pham Ngoc Thach 
Hospital (the supervisory institution of the District TB Units in southern Vietnam), Ho Chi 
Minh City Health Services and the Oxford University Tropical Research Ethics Committee, 
UK (Oxtrec 030-07). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.
DNA extraction and sequencing
Mtb isolates were subcultured on Lowenstein Jensen media and DNA extracted at the 
Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in HCMC using the cetyl trimethylammonium 
bromide (CTAB) extraction protocol as described previously 51. DNA was successfully 
obtained from N=1,728 isolates and shipped to the University of Melbourne for whole 
genome sequencing. DNA extracts were purified using AxyPrep™ Mag PCR Normalizer 
Protocol prior to library preparation. A total of N=1,655 DNA samples passed QC, were 
included for sequencing and subjected to library preparation using the Nextera XT protocol. 
Libraries were quantified using Quant-iT PicoGreen (dsDNA kit, Invitrogen), then 
normalised and pooled to 4 nM concentration. DNA underwent 150 bp paired end 
sequencing (Rapid mode v2) on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina, San Diego). 
Sequence data was excluded for N=19 Mtb isolates that yielded less than the pre-established 
criteria of 10x mean read depth across the Mtb genome, as SNPs can not be reliably called 
below this depth. Sequence data was successfully generated for N=1,635 Mtb isolates from 
HCMC (representing 90% of those isolated from eligible patients in the cohort) with median 
three million reads per sample, providing median 99.2% coverage and 86x depth for each 
Mtb genome (Supplementary Table 1). To confirm the esxW codon 2 SNP, we performed 
PCR and capillary sequencing of the region flanking the SNP in all non-Beijing lineage 
strains in which the SNP was detected from Illumina data. The primers used are listed in 
Supplementary Table 4.
Data Availability
Mtb genome data generated from 1,635 isolates (Figure 1) has been deposited in NCBI 
BioProject [accession ID: PRJNA355614; see URLs section]. A total of 3,144 Mtb genomes 
were included in the analysis in Figure 3, comprising data from localized studies: 1,032 
from Russia 3, 1,621 from Malawi 4,5, 248 Argentina 16, and 78 from China 17; as well as

 106 globally dispersed Lineage 2 genomes 18 and 59 globally dispersed Lineage 1 genomes 
19,20. Illumina Mtb genome sequences from various previously published studies were 
downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive (see URLs section, individual accession 
numbers are given in (Supplementary Table 2). The H37Rv reference genome sequence (see 
URLs section) was used for all reference-driven analyses.
SNP analysis
Sequence reads were mapped to the H37Rv reference genome using the RedDog pipeline 
v0.5 (see URLs section). Briefly, Bowtie2 v2.2.3 was used for read alignment with the 
sensitive-local algorithm and the maximum insert length set to 2000 (via the -x parameter) 
52 and variant sites (i.e. SNPs) were called using SAMTools v0.1.19 53. SNPs located in 
previously reported repetitive regions of the genome were excluded prior to phylogenetic 
analysis 54,55 (Supplementary Table 5); sites for which a definitive allele call could not be 
made in at least 99.5% of all isolate sequences were also excluded from the set of SNPs used 
for phylogenetic analysis. Two SNP alignments were compiled for analysis: one comprising 
the 1,635 HCMC isolates (total 73,718 SNPs), and one comprising all 4,779 isolates 
(including the HCMC isolates and the global collections downloaded from public data; total 
133,492 SNPs).
In silico lineage and antimicrobial resistance typing
Mykrobe Predictor v0.3.6 was used to analyse raw Illumina reads generated from HCMC 
Mtb isolates and (a) assign each isolate to one of the seven Mtb lineages, and (b) detect 
known resistance associated polymorphisms 56 (summarized in Table 1, individual mutation 
calls are provided in Supplementary Table 1). All Mtb isolates were further assigned to 
sublineages by comparing SNPs identified using RedDog with those used in the haplotyping 
scheme defined by Coll et al. 6 (lineage assignments are in Supplementary Tables 1-2).
Phylogenomic analyses
ML phylogenetic trees were inferred using RAxML v7.7.2 57 for (a) all HCMC isolates 
(presented in Fig. 1); and (b) each of lineages 1, 2 and 4 using combined data from the 
HCMC isolates and available public data (presented in Fig. 3; see isolates list in 
Supplementary Tables 1-2). The trees presented are those with the highest likelihood from 5 
replicate runs, constructed using the GTR model of nucleotide substitution and a Gamma 
model of rate heterogeneity to analyse a concatenated alignment of SNP alleles. An 
approximate ML tree containing all data (HCMC isolates and available public data) was 
inferred using FastTree v2.1.8 58. Ancestral sequence reconstruction was performed for the 
HCMC tree and combined tree using FastML v3.1 to infer the sequence alignment at each 
internal node of the ML phylogeny 59. Substitution events occurring on each branch of the 
tree were extracted by comparing the joint reconstruction sequences for the parent and child 
nodes; these data were used to identify homoplasic SNPs, and to identify lineage-specific 
polymorphisms as well as independent occurrences of those polymorphisms outside of the 
lineage of interest (data in Table 2). Terminal branch lengths reported are the number of 
substitutions (SNPs) mapped to each terminal branch (data in Fig. 2a) and were compared to 
Beijing 2.2.1 sublineage using 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Metrics for genetic 
diversity and tree topology were calculated from the phylogenies using R. Node-to-tip

 distances showed similar variances within groups (standard deviations of 27-75 SNPs) and 
all groups were compared to Beijing 2.2.1 sublineage using 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
tests. Clusters were defined as subtrees for whom the maximum patristic distance between 
descendant tips fell below a specified threshold (data in Fig. 2b-c). Each cluster was checked 
to determine whether all members of the cluster shared any of the antimicrobial resistance 
mutations identified by Mykrobe Predictor; clusters in which no known antimicrobial 
resistance mutation was conserved in all members of the cluster are reported as not 
explained by antimicrobial resistance (data in Supplementary Figure 2).
Phylogeography analysis
Transmission between geographical regions was assessed separately for Lineage 1, 2 and 4 
trees using an implementation of stochastic mapping on phylogenies (SIMMAP) 
implemented in the phytools v0.5 package for R 60,61. Region of origin was treated as a 
discrete trait and mapped to each tree using the ARD model (which allows each region-to-
region transfer rate to vary independently) with 100 replicates. The results reported (Fig. 3d) 
are the median values for the number of transitions to Vietnam from any other region, 
summarized from 100 replicate mappings for each tree.
Esx sequence analysis
Esx protein sequences were extracted from the H37Rv reference genome using Artemis, 
aligned using Muscle, and subjected to phylogenetic inference using PhyML v3.0 (tree in 
Fig. 4). DNA sequences flanking the start codon of each esx gene were extracted from the 
H37Rv reference genome using Artemis and aligned and visualised using JalView v2.6.1 
(Fig. 4).
Macrophage infections
Mtb infection of macrophages (THP1 human cell line, 88081201, Sigma-Aldrich) has been 
previously described 62. To study Mtb growth in macrophages, 2.5 x 105 THP1 cells were 
seeded in 24-well cell culture plates and infected with Mtb isolates in triplicate at a 
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. At 4h post infection extracellular bacteria were 
removed by washing. At 0, 4, 7 and 11 days post-infection, intracellular bacteria were 
harvested and plated on Middlebrook 7H10 agar plates. Colony forming unit counts resulted 
after 3 to 4 weeks incubation at 37°C. To measure genome-wide Mtb expression levels, 
confluent monolayers of 1.5 x 107 THP1 in 75cm2 cell culture flasks were infected with Mtb 
isolates at MOI 4. At 4h post infection extracellular bacteria were removed by washing. At 
24h post-infection, intracellular bacteria were stabilized and collected in guanidine 
thiocyanate-based lysis buffer (4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 0.5% Na N-lauryl sarcosine, 25 
mM sodium citrate, and 0.1 M β-mercaptoethanol). Total RNA from was then extracted 
using a previously published method 63.
RNAseq analysis
RNA samples were subjected to reverse transcription and the resulting cDNA was sequenced 
via Illumina HiSeq (100 bp paired end) at Macrogen. The resulting reads were first mapped 
to the H37Rv Mtb reference genome to retrieve bacterial sequences, resulting in 6-19

 million bacterial sequence reads per sample. A strain-specific reference genome was 
prepared for each of the eight Mtb isolates, by polishing the H37Rv genome sequence with 
the Illumina reads previously obtained by sequencing whole genomic DNA extracted from 
that isolate (i.e. the data used for phylogenomic analyses) using Pilon (v1.22) with default 
settings. For each isolate, the RNAseq reads were mapped to the isolate’s own reference 
genome sequence using Bowtie2 (v2.2.3) 52. Read alignments were visualised using the 
BamView function in v14.0.0 64, which was also used to filter reads to include only those 
with mapping score ≥30 for both forward and reverse reads, and to extract read counts for 
regions of interest. Expression values for the ESX-5 locus were calculated as the total reads 
mapping to the region spanning from pe19 to eccA5 (coordinates 2029880 to 2038532 in 
H37Rv). Due to the very close sequence homology in the protein-coding regions of the 
QILSS genes, it was not possible to assess their expression by counting total reads mapping 
to the length of the gene. Instead, we assessed relative expression of these genes by 
extracting the number of reads mapping to a unique 30 bp marker region spanning the start 
codon of each paralog (coordinates -21 to +9 relative to the first base pair in each protein-
coding sequence; see Fig. 4 for uniqueness of these regions). To facilitate comparison of 
QILSS gene expression across strains with different RNAseq library sizes, we normalised 
the read counts for each isolate by the total number of reads mapping to the ESX-5 locus 
from pe19 to eccA5 (coordinates 2029880 to 2038532 in H37Rv). The ESX-5 locus was 
chosen for this purpose as all QILSS proteins are secreted by ESX-5 and thus depend on its 
expression (note the locus contains the QILSS gene esxM, which was the highest expressed 
of all QILSS genes in all isolates). The ratios of reads mapping to each QILSS gene vs 
ESX-5 locus in each strain i (xi/ESX-5i) is shown in Figure 4. To investigate differences in 
QILSS gene expression between wildtype (i) and mutant (j) isolate pairs (Fig. 4), we 
calculated the difference in these ratios relative to the wildtype level, as follows: (xi/ESX-5i 
– xj/ESX-5j)/(xi/ESX-5i).
Computational protein structure analysis
Structure guided approaches can provide valuable insight into the molecular mechanism of 
mutations and their role in diseases 20,65–74, 75. To evaluate the structural effects of the 
Thr2Ala mutation in EsxW, models of EsxW and EsxV were generated using Modeller 
v9.1976 and MacroModel (vSchrodinger 2017, New York, NY), based on the experimental 
structures of homologous ESAT-6-like complexes (PDB IDs: 1WA8, 2KG7, 2VS0, 3OGI, 
3ZBH, 4GZR, 4IOG and 4LWS; sequence identities ranging from 20-91%). The models 
were then minimized using the MMF94s forcefield in Sybyl-X 2.1.1 (Certara L.P., St Louis, 
MO), with the final structure having more than 95% of residues in the allowed region of a 
Ramachandran plot. The quality of the models was confirmed with Verify3D v1 (data not 
shown). Model structures were examined using Pymol v1.9. The model of the EsxW-EsxV 
complex was built using the homologous complexes to guide protein docking. The EsxW 
protomer and EsxW-EsxV heterodimer model were subjected to molecular dynamics to 
generate a series of representative conformations using Desmond (vSchrodinger 2017, New 
York, NY). Sodium and chloride ions were added to reach a final concentration of 150 mM 
Na+ and the system was solvated. The Amber and Charmm36 force fields were applied to 
the system and the default Desmond minimization and equilibration procedure was 
followed. Simulations were kept at constant pressure (1 atom) and temperature (335 K). The

 structural consequences of the EsxW Thr2Ala variant were analysed to account for all the 
potential effects of the mutations 77. The effects of the variant upon the stability of EsxW 
was predicted using SDM v2 78, mCSM-Stability v1 79 and DUET v1 80. The effect of the 
mutations upon the affinity of EsxW to bind to EsxV, and the stability of the complex, were 
predicted using mCSM-PPI v1 79. The predictions were analysed and averaged across the 
conformational landscape. These computational approaches represent the wild-type 
structural and chemical environment of a residue as a graph based signature in order to 
determine the change upon mutation in Gibb’s Free Energy of stability or binding. Reported 
results are based on analysis of EsxW (wildtype and Thr2Ala mutant) and EsxV amino acid 
sequences encoded in the H37Rv (lineage 4) reference genome; the only difference between 
these dimers and those encoded in lineage 1 or 2 is at EsxV residues 20 and 23. Structural 
modelling with the lineage 1/2 EsxV sequence yielded the same results as the analyses 
conducted with the lineage 4 background (i.e. stronger binding affinity observed with the 
EsxW Thr2Ala mutant).
Biophysical Measurements
EsxV and wildtype (2Thr) and mutant (2Ala) EsxW were cloned into a pET18 vector with a 
C-terminal hexahistidine tag (again using the sequences encoded in H37Rv (lineage 4) 
reference genome). A di-lysine motif was added prior to the hexahistidine tag of EsxW to 
facilitate labelling on the extended C-terminus. Protein was expressed, purified and refolded 
following the method of Mahmood and colleagues81. Solution microscale thermophoresis 
(MST) binding studies were performed to measure the binding affinity of EsxV for both the 
wildtype and mutant EsxW, using standard protocols on a Monolith NT.115 (Nanotemper 
Technologies)82–84. The EsxW was chosen to be labelled due to the presence of a lysine in 
EsxV at the heterodimer binding interface. As there were no lysines present in EsxW, the 
dilysine motif was added to the C-terminal projection to facilitate labelling using a RED-
NHS (Amine Reactive) Protein Labeling Kit (Nanotemper Technologies), which contains an 
NT-647 dye, as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Labelled either wildtype or 2Ala mutant 
EsxW was mixed with EsxV in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20. Each replicate was undertaken 
using a 16-step 2-fold serial dilution series. The EsxW protein concentration was chosen 
such that the observed fluorescence was approximately 400 units at 70% LED power. The 
samples were loaded into standard capillaries and heated at 40% laser power (48 mW) for 30 
s, followed by 5 s cooling. The data were normalized against the baseline obtained in the 
absence of any EsxV, and the maximal response obtained at the highest concentration of 
inhibitor. The dissociation constant KD was obtained by plotting the normalized 
fluorescence (Fnorm) against the logarithm of the concentrations of the dilution series and 
resulted in a sigmoidal binding curve that could be directly fitted with a nonlinear solution 
of the law of mass action (Figure 4). All experiments were performed with four replicates, 
and the normalized fluorescence thermophoresis curves were analyzed using GraphPad v6 
(GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA).
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.3.3 unless otherwise stated. 
Associations between lineages and patient demographics (age group, sex) were assessed 
using Fisher’s exact test (two-sided in all cases) to assess n=1,634 HCMC Mtb genomes (i.e. 
Holt et al.

 excluding the Lineage 3 isolate). A linear test for trend in proportions was also used to test 
for an increase in frequency of Lineage 1 within increasing age groups (also n=1,634). Tests 
for difference in the distributions of terminal branch lengths or node-to-tip distances 
between lineages (Fig 2) were conducted using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (two-sided in 
all cases, n=1,634 Mtb genomes). Differences in the proportion of pairs involved in 
transmission clusters between lineages, or between case pairs isolated at the same DTU 
within ≤10 SNP or ≤20 SNP clusters vs pairs separated by >20 SNPs (Supplementary Figure 
1), were tested using a two-sided test for equal proportions (n=1,634 Mtb genomes). A two-
tailed t-test was used to compare KD values for mutant vs wildtype (Fig 4f), analysed using 
GraphPad Prism (n=8, i.e. 4 replicates each for wildtype and mutant).
