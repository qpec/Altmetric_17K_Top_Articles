undetermined significance

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is, in many ways, a unique hematologic entity. Unlike
most hematologic conditions in which the diagnosis is intentional and credited to hematologists, the discovery of MGUS
is most often incidental and made by nonhematologists. MGUS is considered an obligate precursor to several lym-
phoplasmacytic malignancies, including immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis, multiple myeloma, and Waldenstr ¨
om
macroglobulinemia. Therefore, long-term follow-up is generally recommended. Despite its high prevalence, there is
surprisingly limited evidence to inform best clinical practice both at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up. We
present 7 vignettes to illustrate common clinical management questions that arise during the course of MGUS. Where
evidence is present, we provide a concise summary of the literature and clear recommendations on management.
Where evidence is lacking, we describe how we practice and provide a rationale for our approach. We also discuss the
potential harms associated with MGUS diagnosis, a topic that is rarely, if ever, broached between patients and
providers, or even considered in academic debate. (Blood. 2018;131(2):163-173)
Introduction
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)
is a premalignant, clonal plasma cell disorder, characterized by
the presence of a monoclonal (M) protein, ,10% clonal plasma
cells in the bone marrow, and absence of multiple myeloma or
related lymphoplasmacytic malignancies (LPMs).1 MGUS is
present in 3% of the general population $50 years old, but only
0.3% among those ,50 years old.2,3 There is a higher risk and
earlier age of onset in blacks than in whites.3,4 It is considered a
requisite precursor of multiple myeloma (MM), as well as im-
munoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis and Waldenstr ¨
om
macroglobulinemia (WM), and can be detected years before
the diagnosis of these particular LPMs.5-7 There are 3 subtypes
of MGUS, namely, immunoglobulin M (IgM) MGUS, non-IgM
MGUS, and light-chain MGUS, each with distinct rate and type
of progression (Table 1).8,9
MGUS is of considerable clinical importance because of its high
prevalence in the general population, the persistent risk of
progression to LPM, its known causal association with several
serious nonmalignant disorders, and the high frequency with
which coincidental associations are detected in practice. Since
its first description in 1960 by Jan G. Waldenstr ¨
om as “essential
hyperglobulinemia” or “benign monoclonal gammopathy” and
the coinage of the current term by Robert A. Kyle in 1978,10,11
there has been a remarkable amount of progress in un-
derstanding the biology, epidemiology, disease associations,
and natural history of MGUS.12,13 Even though there is universal
agreement on the criteria for the diagnoses of MGUS and LPMs,1
the more practical aspects, such as guidelines for the extent of
initial evaluation and subsequent follow-up of MGUS, are less
than uniform because of the lack of high-level evidence.14-17 In
this article, we select 7 MGUS cases from our daily practice to
illustrate commonly encountered clinical questions and describe
how we manage them. We also summarize the relevant sup-
porting literature and highlight controversial areas in which
evidence is insufficient or absent.
Case 1. Indications for testing and
disease associations
A 75-year-old man was admitted for overnight observation after
presenting with a 5-day history of headache, persistent cough,
severe lower-rib pain, and generalized weakness. Physical ex-
amination and chest x-ray were unremarkable. The next day,
nasal swab showed the presence of influenza A. On admission,
his laboratory evaluation (reference ranges provided paren-
thetically) was remarkable only for a hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL
(13.5-17.5). Subsequent tests included a serum protein elec-
trophoresis (SPEP), immunofixation, and free light-chain (FLC)
studies that revealed a monoclonal IgGl of 0.5 g/dL with normal
FLC values. The anemia and rib pains resolved weeks later.
When do we test for monoclonal gammopathy?
In general, we test for the presence of monoclonal gammopathy
in patients who have clinical symptoms and signs concerning for
the presence of MM, AL amyloidosis, or WM. However, with the
exception of diffuse lytic bone lesions, macroglossia, infiltrative
cardiomyopathy, and engorgement of retinal veins, most pre-
senting symptoms and signs of LPMs are nonspecific. As a result,
in most instances when testing for M-proteins is performed, an
alternative explanation for the clinical presentation is typically

 found, and patients with positive tests are labeled as having an
incidental diagnosis of MGUS. Because MGUS is common and
LPMs are rare (;35 000 new cases annually),2,18 the chance of
identifying LPM in day-to-day practice is very low. In a study of
7090 patients without a history of LPM who had SPEP performed
for various indications, 3% were found to have MGUS, and only
1% were diagnosed with LPM. The majority (81%) of tests were
performed by nonhematologists.19 It is estimated that, on av-
erage, a hematologist-oncologist in the United States sees
2 new MM cases annually and 1 new case of AL and WM every
10 years.20 These numbers are expected to be far less in general
medical practice. We also look for monoclonal gammopathy if a
patient has a nonmalignant disease known to be a cause of,
or associated with, monoclonal gammopathy, especially if the
treatment requires control or eradication of the plasma cell clone
(see the next section).
What are the nonmalignant diseases associated
with monoclonal gammopathy?
Table 2 displays a list of nonmalignant diseases secondary to,
or associated with, monoclonal gammopathy. The presence of
any of these conditions prompts us to screen for monoclonal
gammopathy, even though signs or symptoms of LPMs are
absent. Because the management of these diseases is beyond
the scope of this article, we have provided relevant references
from recent publications. In addition, we direct the readers to
case vignettes and reviews for more in-depth clinical descrip-
tions and general management.21-25
How do we screen for monoclonal gammopathy?
We perform SPEP, serum immunofixation, and FLC as the initial
screening test when looking for LPMs associated with mono-
clonal gammopathy. Urine protein electrophoresis is ordered
subsequently when an M-protein is detected. This panel of
testing is highly sensitive because it will detect an M-protein in
virtually all patients with MM, AL amyloidosis, and WM.26
Case 2. Extent of evaluation
A 78-year-old woman was evaluated for chronic progressive
right-shoulder pain, limiting her joint mobility. She was a farmer
and engaged in heavy lifting. A shoulder x-ray showed advanced
degenerative arthritis and no lytic lesion. Laboratory tests
revealed a normal complete blood count, calcium, and creati-
nine, but total protein was elevated at 8.7 g/dL (6.3-7.9). Further
testing showed IgGk M-protein of 1.7 g/dL, k FLC of 8.61 mg/dL
(0.33-1.94), l FLC of 0.63 mg/dL (0.57-2.63), and k/l ratio of
13.67 (0.26-1.65). Because the M-protein and FLC were sub-
stantially elevated, additional work-up was performed. A bone
marrow biopsy showed 6% k-restricted plasma cells. A low-dose
whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan did not show lytic
lesions. She was diagnosed with MGUS.

From 
 What are the minimum tests necessary during the
initial evaluation of monoclonal gammopathy?
Once an M-protein is detected, the extent of further evaluation
to rule out LPM depends on the pretest probability of the latter
and whether or not an alternative explanation for the signs or
symptoms that prompted the screening was found. We gen-
erally order the following tests, if not yet done, at the time of
hematology consult: complete blood count, serum calcium,
creatinine, FLC, immunofixation, and 24-h urine protein
electrophoresis.
When do we perform skeletal imaging and bone
marrow biopsy?
Although by definition, MGUS requires bone marrow clonal
plasma cells ,10% and no evidence of lytic lesions on skeletal
imaging,1 not all patients with suspected MGUS need these tests
(Figure 1).15,27 In patients with low-risk MGUS who do not have
any unexplained clinical concerns, skeletal imaging and bone
marrow biopsy can be deferred. We use the Mayo Clinic risk
stratification model with low-risk defined as having all of the
following: serum M-protein #1.5 g/dL, IgG isotype, and normal
FLC ratio.28 A study of 1271 patients found that the probability of
finding bone marrow plasma cells $10% in patients with an IgG
MGUS and M-spike #1.5 g/dL was very low (4.7%). Similarly, the
probability of finding bone lesions with M-spike #1.5 g/dL was
also very low (2.5%).29 Moreover, in a large Mayo Clinic study,
the life-time risk of progression was only 2% in patients with low-
risk MGUS, despite the fact that only 10% of patients had
baseline bone marrow biopsies to confirm the diagnosis.28 Thus,
routine skeletal imaging and bone marrow biopsy in low-risk
MGUS have a low yield. In these patients, a follow-up assess-
ment of M-protein level in 6 months will most likely identify any
patient who needs further evaluation. Because approximately
50% of MGUS patients are low risk,28 avoiding skeletal imaging
and bone marrow biopsy in these patients will minimize health
care costs without adversely affecting clinical outcome. Risk
stratification models developed by the Spanish and Swedish
groups are also available.9,30
Skeletal imaging can also be deferred in IgM MGUS patients
without unexplained bony symptoms. IgM M-protein is as-
sociated most commonly with WM, which seldom causes lytic
lesions. Although IgM MM can be encountered rarely, we feel
that in the absence of bone-related symptoms, routine
skeletal imaging in IgM MGUS is unnecessary. Similarly, a
baseline bone marrow biopsy can also be omitted in patients
with apparently asymptomatic IgM MGUS who have a small
quantity of M-protein (,1.5 gm/dL) and normal blood counts
because the probability of finding an LPM needing therapy
is very low. Although data on light-chain MGUS are lacking,
we do not recommend routine skeletal imaging and bone marrow
evaluation in patients who have a low involved/uninvolved
FLC ratio (,8) in whom there are no clinical concerns for
LPMs.
For all other patients with MGUS (as in the patient presented
in case 2), we perform skeletal imaging (either conventional
radiographic survey or low-dose whole-body CT) and bone
marrow biopsy at the time of diagnosis. If available, low-dose
whole-body CT is preferred because it is a more sensitive
test.31
Case 3. Follow-up
A 70-year-old man who moved to town was seen in the out-
patient clinic to establish primary care. Initial blood tests showed
normal complete blood count, calcium, and creatinine levels.
He was diagnosed with IgGk MGUS 10 years ago during the
evaluation of sensory neuropathy. At diagnosis, the serum
M-protein was 0.5 g/dL, but subsequent values were unavail-
able. On repeat testing, the M-protein was 0.7 g/dL. FLC studies
were performed for the first time and showed k 2.6 mg/dL,
l 1.8 mg/dL, and k/l ratio of 1.44.
What is the evidence for MGUS follow-up?
The purpose of follow-up in MGUS is to detect early progression
of MGUS into LPM, with the expectation that major complica-
tions will be minimized and survival prolonged because of
the initiation of timely treatment. However, prospective data
supporting routine follow-up of MGUS are unavailable.32 The
most relevant evidence comes from 2 population-based studies
showing better overall survival (identical hazard ratios of 0.9)
among MM patients who had an MGUS diagnosis or follow-up
prior to the discovery of MM.33,34 In 1 study, the rates of acute
kidney injury, fracture, and hypercalcemia were also decreased.34
On the basis of these data, one could argue that MM patients
with a known diagnosis of MGUS do better because they are
followed annually, leading to timely diagnosis and prevention
of serious complications. However, without randomized trials
comparing follow-up versus no follow-up, it is not possible to
infer a causal relationship, and these improved outcomes may
be due to lead-time bias. Furthermore, studies show that most
patients with MGUS, including those with high-risk MGUS, who
progress to symptomatic LPMs, are diagnosed incidentally and
not as a result of follow-up.19,35 Approximately one third of
progressions diagnosed during follow-up of MGUS are smol-
dering multiple myeloma,35 a rate double that expected in the
population (;15%).36 Despite these limitations, and the lack of
data from randomized trials, annual follow-up is recommended
in current clinical practice guidelines for the majority of patients
with MGUS given the seriousness of certain LPM complications
and the relative ease with which testing for M-proteins can be
added to other routine medical tests (Table 3).14-17 Prior to the
publication of these guidelines, institutional studies showed
that follow-up practices varied substantially in both academic
and community settings.35,37 However, years after the publi-
cations of these guidelines, evidence suggests that they have
not been widely adopted. A recent MGUS pattern of care
study in the United States showed a relatively low guideline
concordance rate (41% to 59%) in terms of follow-up fre-
quency, with significant disparities both geographically and
demographically.38
Who do we follow and for how long?
Our recommendations for follow-up largely conform to the
guidelines of the International Myeloma Working Group.15 We
recommend that all patients with MGUS be reassessed in
6 months with complete blood count, SPEP, FLC, calcium, and
creatinine to determine clinical stability and detect rapidly
evolving LPM. Although this practice is sensible and recom-
mended by all clinical practice guidelines,14-17 evidence for this
approach was unavailable until recently. A large retrospective
nationwide study performed in the United States (N 5 17 963)
suggests that the risk of MGUS transformation is highest during

 the first year (2.1%) and gradually declines thereafter (1.6%,
1.2%, 1.0%, and 0.8%, for years 2-5, respectively).39 After initial
follow-up, patients with low-risk MGUS need additional follow-
up of MGUS only if symptoms concerning for LPMs develop.28
These patients have only a 2% risk of progression over a 20-year
period. All other patients with MGUS should have an annual
follow-up (Figure 2). Discontinuation of such follow-up can be
considered for patients with a life expectancy of ,5 years and
among those .80 years old, consistent with screening guide-
lines for other common yet potentially curable cancers (dis-
continuation of screening at .65 years of age for cervical cancer,
.75 years for breast and colon cancers, and .80 years for lung
cancer).40 Nevertheless, evidence suggests that the majority
(60%) of MGUS patients .80 years old continue to be followed
regularly in current clinical practice.38
Case 4. Progression
A 50-year-old man presented with anemia and new onset of
severe back pain. He had been diagnosed with MGUS 9 years
ago with a serum monoclonal IgGk of 1.7 g/dL. He was followed
annually, and the M-protein level fluctuated between 1.6 and
1.9 g/dL. Over the last 2 years, there was a gradual rise in
M-protein to 2.5 g/dL, but there were no clinical features to
suggest transformation into LPM. Laboratory tests revealed a
further increase in M-protein to 3.2 g/dL. Serum FLC assay showed
k 23.6 mg/dL, l 1.0 mg/dL, and FLC ratio of 23.6. Skeletal survey
detected multiple lytic lesions and pathologic vertebral fractures.
Bone marrow biopsy revealed ;50% k-restricted plasma cells.
When should we suspect progression to an LPM?
A rising M-protein or serum FLC level should raise concern for
progression but is seen in only about 50% of patients with MGUS
prior to diagnosis of disease progression.5-7 Even when a change
occurs, it is challenging to interpret such a change if it is not
accompanied by symptoms or alterations in other laboratory
parameters such as hemoglobin, calcium, or creatinine. A
recent study in patients with smoldering multiple myeloma
has identified specific changes in M-protein and hemoglobin
levels associated with rapid symptomatic progression in more
than 80% of patients.41 However, among those with MGUS, an
“evolving” pattern (progressive rise in M-protein over 3 annual
consecutive measurements) is associated with progression
only in approximately 50% over a 10-year period. In contrast,
a “nonevolving” pattern is associated with a low likelihood
of LPM transformation (10% in 10 years).42 In addition to
changes in M-protein level, progression should be consid-
ered in the presence of any unexplained signs and symptoms
listed in Table 4. Any concern for progression should prompt
additional testing, such as bone marrow or tissue biopsy, or
imaging studies. To make a timely diagnosis, current di-
agnostic criteria for MM have been updated to allow a di-
agnosis to be made prior to end-organ damage and enable
the use of advanced imaging for early detection of bone
disease. In this patient, it is possible that earlier use of whole-
body low-dose CT or positron emission tomography CT to
work up a rising M-protein level may have led to a more timely
diagnosis.

 What are the other complications that can result
from MGUS besides progression to LPM?
MGUS has been reported to be associated with .130 different
diseases in addition to progression to malignancy.43 Because of
the high prevalence of MGUS in the general population, most of
these reported associations are likely coincidental. However,
some associations have been verified and are now considered
to be causally related to MGUS. These include monoclonal
gammopathy–associated peripheral neuropathy,25 monoclo-
nal immunoglobulin deposition disease,44 and monoclonal
gammopathy–associated proliferative glomerulonephritis.45,46
In addition, some studies show that patients with MGUS
may be at a higher risk of fractures (increased cortical bone
porosity) and deep vein thrombosis.47-49 Awareness of these
(and other) known disease associations and exclusion of other
causes of these syndromes are important for accurate di-
agnosis (Table 2).
Case 5. Screening for monoclonal
gammopathy in asymptomatic patients
A 61-year-old man was referred to hematology because of a strong
family history of MM. His mother was diagnosed with active MM at
the age of 70 and died 8 years later, and his sister was found to have
the same diagnosis just 3 months before the visit. Neither his mother
nor sister had risk factors. Prior to hematology referral, he had an
SPEP and FLC performed, and no M-protein was detected.
Current practice guidelines do not recommend routine
screening for MGUS in the general population because of the

From 
 lack of proven benefit and absence of curative or preventive
therapy.14-17 Although this rationale appears to be sound, the
counterargument also has merits. It is notable that only ;20% of
prevalent MGUS cases are clinically recognized and fewer than
10% of MM, AL amyloidosis, or WM patients have a prior clinical
diagnosis of MGUS.33,34,50 Therefore, approximately 80% of
prevalent MGUS cases (approximately 2.8 million individuals in
the United States) are not clinically recognized.51 Although this
group of individuals should be at similar risk of progression to
LPM, we neither seek them out nor follow their clinical course.
A randomized controlled trial of MGUS screening is currently
ongoing in Iceland to determine whether screening of the
general population will be of clinical benefit,.
The prevalence of MGUS is increased in certain demographics
(blacks, persons with occupational exposures to certain
pesticides),2,4,52 immunocompromised patients (HIV infection,
transplant recipients),53-55 and first-degree relatives of patients
with MGUS or LPMs.56,57 These associations support a role for
germline susceptibility genes and shared environmental expo-
sures. They also raise the question of whether we should screen
individuals at particularly high risk. Although there is no treat-
ment, such individuals may benefit from periodic follow-up to
prevent major complications. The patient in this case has 2 first-
degree relatives affected with MM. We believe that it may be
reasonable to screen for monoclonal gammopathy in high-risk
patients who have 2 or more first-degree relatives with MM, AL
amyloidosis, or WM, while we await data of the efficacy of
screening from the Icelandic trial.
Case 6. Light-chain MGUS
A 76-year-old man was incidentally found to have hypercalcemia
during an annual clinic visit. Because the review of systems
elicited new-onset low-back pain, further evaluation was per-
formed. Pertinent blood findings included a normal complete
blood count and creatine, calcium at 10.9 mg/dL (8.9-10.1),
parathyroid hormone at 72 pg/mL (15-65), and serum phos-
phorus at 2.1 mg/dL (2.5-4.5). SPEP and serum immunofixation
were normal. Serum FLC studies showed k 6.1 mg/dL, l 1.5 mg/dL,
and k:l 4.07. Lumbar radiographs showed degenerative changes
without compression fracture or lytic lesion. The hypercalcemia was
attributed to hyperparathyroidism, and the back pain resolved a
week later.
What is light-chain MGUS?
The criteria for light-chain MGUS are listed on Table 1. A di-
agnosis of light-chain MGUS is made when a patient meeting the
clinical criteria for MGUS has an M-protein consisting only of
either monoclonal k or l light chains without an immunoglobulin
heavy chain. It is a distinct entity and considered the precursor
of light-chain MM (20% of all MM) and majority (65%) of
AL amyloidosis.58 Unlike MGUS with intact immunoglobulin,
light-chain MGUS is less common, with a prevalence of 0.8%
among individuals age $50 years and a lower rate of malignant

From 
 transformation to LPM of 0.3% per year. The risk of renal disease
is increased in this population.59 As was stated earlier, we do not
recommend routine skeletal imaging and bone marrow evalu-
ation in patients who have a low involved/uninvolved FLC ratio
(,8.0), in whom there are no clinical concerns for LPM. Patients
should be followed-up in 6 months and then annually.
How do we interpret light-chain values in patients
with chronic kidney disease?
Because serum FLCs are cleared by the kidneys, their concen-
trations rise as the glomerular filtration rate falls. Generally,
both polyclonal k and l FLC levels are elevated and produce an
FLC ratio that is within the normal range (0.26-1.65). In patients
with chronic kidney disease, studies show that k FLC levels tend
to be higher, resulting in a revised renal reference range for
FLC ratio of 0.37 to 3.1.60 Thus, to consider that an increase in
the serum FLCs is a result of clonal plasma cell disorder, the
serum FLC ratio must be ,0.37 or .3.1 in patients with renal
impairment. If the FLC ratio falls within the renal range but the
index of suspicion for an underlying monoclonal gammopathy
remains high, we add urine protein electrophoresis and urine
immunofixation for confirmation.
Case 7. Harms of MGUS diagnosis
A 32-year-old woman was incidentally found to have an
M-protein after participating in a blood donor screening held at
a plasma donation center. She was healthy otherwise and given a
diagnosis of MGUS. For 5 years, she was followed annually by
her hematologist, and her M-protein remained stable. During
the most recent visit, she confided, for the first time, that she was
“scared to death” to come to follow-up visits. Every day, she felt
as though she was “living on a cliff” and “could fall off anytime.”
She lived in fear of hearing “the bad news” that she might not be
lucky enough to “dodge the bullet” this time.
Although rarely a topic of doctor’s office conversation or even
academic debate, the potential harms associated with MGUS
diagnosis and subsequent follow-up deserve more attention.
Several studies have now shown that psychological distress
suffered by patients with nonmalignant hematologic diseases,
including MGUS, is no less than it is for those with malignancies.61-63
An in-depth survey showed that among patients referred to a
university cancer center for evaluation of nonmalignant he-
matologic diagnoses, nearly half reported increases in anxiety
and stress (46% and 40%, respectively) and almost a third
(30%) reported fear of having a cancer during the referral
process.64 Similarly, a physician survey revealed similar
concerns.65 Although this may be in part due to patients un-
dergoing evaluation at cancer centers or being cared for by
hematologists who also practice oncology, paying more at-
tention to the psychological concerns of MGUS patients is
warranted. Similar to cancer screenings, overdiagnoses of
LPMs, especially the smoldering type, are inevitable.66 Harms
of overtreatment and surveillance are well documented in
cases of solid tumors but have yet to be studied in MGUS or
monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, the precursor to B-cell
chronic lymphocytic leukemia.67 Finally, the economic cost of
MGUS follow-up is substantial and cannot be ignored. With
over 500 000 individuals living with a diagnosis of MGUS in the
United States and assuming once-yearly follow-up, the health
care cost is estimated to be over $100 million annually.51
Although it is relatively easy to order SPEP, serum immuno-
fixation, and serum FLC assays, clinicians need to be more
judicious when ordering these tests, given the consequences
of a MGUS diagnosis. These tests should be performed only in
patients in whom there is clear suspicion of certain LPMs or
conditions known to be associated with M-protein (Table 2).
Conclusion and future directions
Because the number of Americans $65 years in 2050 is pro-
jected to be more than double that in 2010, we expect that the
number of living individuals diagnosed with MGUS will be well
over a million in 30 years.51,68 How do we individualize MGUS
follow-up care at the time of diagnosis while simultaneously
accounting for life expectancy and competing comorbidities?
In this article, we have outlined our approach to diagnostic
work-up and management of patients with MGUS based on
current data and our experience in managing these patients.
We need studies targeted to populations that are at the
highest risk of developing MGUS, including blacks and first-
degree relatives of patients with LPMs. We must routinely
engage our patients in an informed conversation incorporating
the absolute risk of MGUS progression and comorbidity-adjusted
life expectancy prior to recommending a follow-up program.
We also need better biomarkers to predict the risk of trans-
formation and into what type of LPM (or nonmalignant disease)
MGUS will transform. In parallel, while awaiting the results of
the Icelandic trial, we should also harness the power of
machine-learning methods to analyze existing big data ac-
cumulated from MGUS patients followed over the past several
decades. We hope that these will not only help reduce patient
anxiety but also permit optimization of follow-up strategies
and the development of preventive measures targeting the
appropriate population.
