cell types in the neocortex

The mammalian neocortex contains many cell types, but whether they organize
into repeated structures has been unclear. We discovered that major cell types
in neocortical layer 5 form a lattice structure in many brain areas. Large-scale
three-dimensional imaging revealed that distinct types of excitatory and inhibitory
neurons form cell type–specific radial clusters termed microcolumns. Thousands of
microcolumns, in turn, are patterned into a hexagonal mosaic tessellating diverse
regions of the neocortex. Microcolumn neurons demonstrate synchronized in vivo
activity and visual responses with similar orientation preference and ocular
dominance. In early postnatal development, microcolumns are coupled by cell
type–specific gap junctions and later serve as hubs for convergent synaptic inputs.
Thus, layer 5 neurons organize into a brainwide modular system, providing a template
for cortical processing.
T
he mammalian neocortex is densely popu-
latedby diverse types of excitatory and inhib-
itory neurons, each with specific molecular
and cellular properties, synaptic connec-
tions, and in vivo functions. Whether neo-
cortical cell types organize into repeated structures
representing common motifs for information
processing has been poorly understood. Cortical
columns, including orientation columns in the vi-
sual cortex and barrels in the somatosensory cor-
tex, have patterned structures, but their cellular
and circuit-level organization is largely unsolved
(1). Moreover, cortical columns are restricted to
specific cortical areas and therefore do not rep-
resent brainwide structural motifs.
In neocortical layer 5, subcerebral projection
neurons (SCPNs) are one of the two major ex-
citatory neuron types and have well-defined
anatomical and genetic specifications. SCPNs
constitute the major cortical output pathway,
sending massive axonal projections to subcortical
targets including the pons, spinal cord, and su-
perior colliculus (2). Prior studies described a lo-
cal arrangement of SCPNs in radial clusters with
a diameter of one to two cells and tangential
distances of a few cell diameters (3, 4). These
clusters, here termed microcolumns, have been
reported in visual and somatosensory cortical
areas in mice (3) and in language areas in hu-
mans (4). To study the cellular organization of
neocortical layer 5, we conducted structural and
functional analyses of SCPN microcolumns and
investigated whether other cell types organize
into microcolumnar structures.
Spatial organization of major cell types
in layer 5
We examined the three-dimensional organiza-
tion of SCPN microcolumns in the mouse brain.
SCPNs were retrogradely labeled by injecting fluo-
rescent tracers into the pons (Fig. 1A and fig. S1A).
After fixation and clearing, the neocortex was
scanned using two-photon microscopy (Fig. 1B).
Confirming previous results (3), we observed SCPN
microcolumns in visual and somatosensory corti-
ces (Fig. 1, C and D). The radial alignment of SCPNs
was also conserved in the motor cortex (Fig. 1E).
Statistical analyses showed a microcolumnar or-
ganization in nearly all examined neocortical re-
gions (Fig. 1F and fig. S1, B to L). The orientation
of microcolumns gradually changed along the
cortex (Fig. 1F and fig. S1M) but remained ap-
proximately parallel to apical dendrites (fig. S1,
N to P, and materials and methods). The radius
of microcolumns was ~10 mm in visual, somato-
sensory, and motor cortices (Fig. 1G).
Analyses of the organization of microcolumns
have been performed previously in brain slices
(3, 4), but their two-dimensional lateral arrange-
ment in the cortex has not been determined. A
two-dimensional Fourier analysis of the SCPN
distribution revealed a periodicity of 30 to 45 mm
(P < 0.001 in three of three mice; fig. S1, Q to S).
We further analyzed the periodicity with a cor-
rection for microcolumn tilt (fig. S1T). Tangential
section images (Fig. 1, H and I) and the autocor-
relogram of the SCPN distribution (Fig. 1J) sug-
gested an approximately hexagonal pattern, which
was observed in multiple cortical areas (Fig. 1K).
We found a sixfold symmetry (P < 0.01; fig. S1, U
to X) but no other rotational symmetries. Consist-
ently, the two-dimensional power spectrum had
six peaks ranging from 24 to 30 cycles/mm, two
of which were located on the anterior-posterior
axis and the other four of which were at lateral
positions (Fig. 1L; computed for areas containing
≥2,000 microcolumns). Individual microcolumns
were positioned near the intersections of the
three waves reconstructed from the six peaks of
the power spectrum (Fig. 1, H and I).
Layer 5 contains another major type of excit-
atory neuron that innervates the cerebral cortex:
cortical projection neurons (CPNs) (2). We labeled
CPNs in Tlx3 (T-cell leukemia homeobox 3)–cre/
Ai9 mice (5) (green in Fig. 2A and fig. S2, A to F)
and, in parallel, visualized SCPN microcolumns
by retrograde labeling (magenta in Fig. 2, A and
B, left). In layer 5b—the lower part of layer 5,
where SCPNs are present—the density of CPNs
radially aligned to SCPNs was lower than the
average density of CPNs (P < 0.01; Fig. 2B, middle),
indicating that CPNs were excluded from SCPN
microcolumns. Moreover, CPNs were radially
aligned to each other in an orientation parallel
to SCPN microcolumns (P < 0.01; Fig. 2B, right).
Thus, CPNs are organized into cell type–specific
microcolumns that interdigitate with SCPN micro-
columns. CPNs in layer 5a also adopted a micro-
columnar arrangement (fig. S2G).
We also investigated the arrangement of the
two most prevalent inhibitory neuron types in layer
5—parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) and somatostatin-
expressing (SOM+) cells (6)—using fluorescent im-
munostaining in three-dimensional samples (7)
(Fig. 2, C to F). PV+ and SOM+ cells aligned radi-
ally with SCPNs (P < 0.01; Fig. 2, C and D) but
not with CPNs (Fig. 2, E and F, and fig. S2H),
indicating a selective alignment of inhibitory neu-
rons to excitatory neuron microcolumns.
In vivo neuronal activity
of microcolumns
In vivo microcolumn activity has been only in-
directly inferred from studies of immediate early
gene expression in fixed slices (3). We therefore
investigated microcolumn activity in vivo using an
adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector that expresses
the Ca2+ indicator G-CaMP6 (8) almost exclusively
in SCPNs (Fig. 3, A and B, and fig. S3), most likely
owing to tropism. Ca2+ signals were obtained from
awake mice using two-photon volume imaging
(120 to 240 mm thick, 1.6 to 2.4 volumes/s). The
orientation of SCPN microcolumns was approxi-
mated from the axes of the apical dendrites. Data
from four representative SCPNs in the binocular
visual cortex, recorded without visual stimulation,
are shown in Figure 3, C to G. Cells 1 to 3 (tan-
gential distance of <15 mm) showed synchronous
Ca2+ signals, whereas cell 4 (tangential distance
to the other three cells of >25 mm) exhibited no
synchronization with other cells (Fig. 3E). In ac-
cord, the temporal correlation of Ca2+ traces was
higher among cells 1 to 3 than between cell 4 and
other cells (Fig. 3G). We calculated the average
correlation as a function of the tangential distance
(Fig. 3H, left). The actual correlation values at
tangential distances of <15 mm were greater than
those for random surrogates (Fig. 3H), whereas
the actual values at tangential distances of >20 mm
were almost at the level of those for the surro-
gates (Fig. 3H), indicating synchronized activity

 within radially aligned SCPNs (Fig. 3, H and I, and
fig. S4, A to D). We also confirmed significant
synchronization within individual microcolumns
(materials and methods). The observed correlation
was not caused by light contamination (Fig. 3, E
and F; fig. S4, E to G; and materials and methods).
Similar results were obtained in the primary so-
matosensory and motor cortices (Fig. 3, J and K;
fig. S4, A to G; and materials and methods).
Although the superficial layers of the mouse
visual cortex show weak clustering of neurons
with similar response properties (9, 10), cellu-
lar clustering for visual functions in layer 5 is
poorly understood. We analyzed the orienta-
tion preference and ocular dominance of SCPN
microcolumns in the binocular visual cortex.
We presented drifting gratings with six differ-
ent orientations (Fig. 4A) and determined the
preferred orientation for each SCPN that exhib-
ited orientation-selective responses. The differ-
ence in the preferred orientation of SCPN pairs
with a tangential distance of >20 mm was similar
to that of randomly selected pairs (~45°; Fig. 4C,
left). In contrast, SCPN pairs with a tangential
distance of <10 mm and pairs within individual
microcolumns had a significantly smaller differ-
ence (~32°; Fig. 4C, left; fig. S4H; and materials
and methods). The similarity was observed even
when the radial distance was as large as ~80 mm
(Fig. 4C, right, and fig. S4H). We also determined
the ocular dominance index (ODI) by stimulat-
ing both eyes alternately (Fig. 4B). The ODI was
similar for SCPN pairs with a tangential dis-
tance of <10 mm and within individual micro-
columns (Fig. 4D and materials and methods).
Chemical and electrical synaptic
connections of microcolumns
We investigated the synaptic circuits that could co-
ordinate microcolumnar neuronal activity. Whole-
cell patch clamp recordings were obtained from
two to four enhanced green fluorescent protein
(EGFP)–labeled SCPNs in acute slices prepared
from the visual cortex of Crym-egfp mice (3) at ~4
postnatal weeks (Fig. 5A), when in vivo synchron-
ized activity was already present (fig. S5A). We
first examined mutual connections and failed to
detect preferential connections between radially

 aligned SCPNs (fig. S5B), consistent with previ-
ous findings (11, 12). We next examined common
synaptic inputs to a pair of neurons, which gen-
erate synchronized excitatory postsynaptic cur-
rents (EPSCs) with a typical time difference of
<1 ms (13–15) (Fig. 5, B and C, and fig. S5, C and D).
When all EPSCs were included for the analysis of
synchronized EPSCs, we found no preference for
radially aligned SCPNs (fig. S5E). We subsequently
examined large EPSCs, which are particularly im-
portant for mammalian brain function (16–18).
When we analyzed the largest 7.4% of EPSCs in-
duced by presynaptic spikes (corresponding to
the largest 2% of all recorded EPSCs, including
those not induced by presynaptic spikes; Fig. 5D;
fig. S5, F and G; and materials and methods), the
probability that radially aligned SCPNs (tangen-
tial distance of <7.5 mm) had synchronized syn-
aptic activity was higher than that expected for
uniform random connections (P = 0.0036, one-
tailed binomial test; Fig. 5E), and more than seven
times that for pairs with only slightly longer tan-
gential distances (7.5 to 22.5 mm; P = 0.0012, one-
tailed Fisher’s exact test; Fig. 5E). The results were
robust against changes in the parameters used for
the analyses (fig. S5H). In contrast, we found no
preference for tangentially aligned SCPNs (P =
0.63, one-tailed binomial test, and P = 0.51, one-
tailed Fisher’s exact test; Fig. 5F). These results
suggest that SCPNs in individual microcolumns
preferentially receive strong synaptic inputs from
common presynaptic neurons (materials and
methods).
Microcolumns are present at postnatal day 6
(P6) (3), when chemical synapses are still infre-
quent (19, 20), suggesting the possibility that
microcolumn neurons have cellular interactions
other than chemical synaptic connections during
cortical development. We therefore investigated
gap junction–mediated electrical coupling, which
is implicated in the development of neuronal cir-
cuits (21), in acute visual cortex slices (Fig. 6, A
and B, and fig. S6, A to D). At P6 to P7, about
half of neighboring SCPN-SCPN and CPN-CPN
pairs exhibited electrical coupling (37 of 75 SCPN-
SCPN pairs, 49%; 44 of 80 CPN-CPN pairs, 55%;
Fig. 6C), whereas only 12% of neighboring SCPN-
CPN pairs were coupled (7 of 58 pairs; Fig. 6C).
The coupling probabilities of SCPN-SCPN and
CPN-CPN pairs were significantly higher than
that of SCPN-CPN pairs (P < 10−5 for both, two-
tailed Fisher’s exact tests). Further, the coupling
coefficients of SCPN-SCPN and CPN-CPN pairs
were significantly greater than those of SCPN-
CPN pairs (Fig. 6C). Electrical coupling became
undetectable by the end of the second postnatal
week (Fig. 6C).
In the radial orientation, the coupling coeffi-
cient of SCPN-SCPN pairs was largely indepen-
dent of distance up to 50 mm (Fig. 6, D and E). In
contrast, in the tangential orientation, the cou-
pling coefficient rapidly decreased and approached
zero at a distance of >30 mm (Fig. 6, D and E).
Consequently, radially aligned pairs had larger
coupling coefficients than tangentially aligned
pairs at the same distance (Fig. 6E). Moreover,
pairs with a tangential distance of <15 mm had
greater coupling coefficients and coupling prob-
abilities than those with larger tangential dis-
tances (Fig. 6F). A similar radial bias was found
for CPN-CPN coupling (fig. S6, E and F). These re-
sults suggest that gap junctions preferentially
couple neurons within individual microcolumns
(materials and methods).
In the developing neocortex, clonally related
excitatory neurons are preferentially coupled by
gap junctions, but the coupling becomes in-
frequent by the end of the first postnatal week
(~2% at P6) (21). In contrast, radially aligned
SCPNs are mostly nonsisters (3) and frequently
coupled at P6 to P7 (Fig. 6, D to F), suggesting
that the coupling observed in this study occurred
between nonsister pairs. In accord, half of neigh-
boring nonsister SCPN pairs had electrical cou-
pling at P6 to P7 (18 of 38 pairs; fig. S6, G to J).
Discussion
We discovered that wide areas of neocortical
layer 5 are organized into a cellular lattice system
composed of cell type–specific microcolumns
(fig. S7). The functional modularity suggests that

 single microcolumns perform elementary cir-
cuit functions that collectively constitute large-
scale parallel processing. The descriptions of
microcolumns in multiple cortical areas in mice
[(3) and this study] and humans (4) suggest that
the lattice system is a neuronal architecture com-
mon to cortical functions as diverse as sensory,
motor, and language processing. The coordi-
nated in vivo activity of SCPN microcolumns
and their convergent inputs indicate that they
constitute a brainwide system of modular, re-
peated synaptic circuits and discrete cortical
output channels.
Several mammalian species, but not rodents,
possess ocular dominance columns and orien-
tation columns. The typical width of an ocular
dominance column is ~500 mm, and the pre-
ferred orientation of orientation columns changes
gradually across the cortical surface. In mice,
neighboring microcolumns (distance of ~40 mm)
had no apparent similarity in visual responses.
We hypothesize that in species that have orien-
tation columns and ocular dominance columns,
neighboring microcolumns may be progressively
arranged to have similar functions, thereby con-
tributing to the anatomy of known cortical col-
umns. Orientation columns have a width roughly
similar to microcolumn spacing (1) and exhibit
a hexagonal arrangement (22); therefore, they
may be constructed on the basis of the lattice
system.

related neurons show electrical coupling in the

 early neonatal stage (21) and later exhibit similar
orientation preference (23, 24). In contrast, our
findings show that microcolumns are composed
of clonally unrelated cells (3) that have specific
electrical coupling during P6 to P7, when cortical
synapses are being generated (19, 20). The tran-
sient coupling may synchronize neuronal activity
and promote the development of microcolumn-
specificcircuits through Hebbian-like mechanisms.
Gap junctions may also facilitate microcolumnar
clustering through cell adhesion properties (25).
Microcolumns might be structurally linked to
“neuronal domains”—radial neuronal clusters ob-
served in neonatal cortex that are suggested to
have gap junction coupling (26–28). Because neu-
ronal domains span multiple cortical layers, micro-
columns might also be present in other cortical
layers.
