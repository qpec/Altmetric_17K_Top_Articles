Abstract
Purpose—Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a major cause of blindness and visual 
disability. Several genetic risk factors for POAG and optic nerve features have been identified. 
Here we measure the relative risk for glaucoma these factors contribute to participants in the 
Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS).
Design—Comparative Series
Participants—1057 (65%) of the 1636 participants of the OHTS were enrolled in this genetics 
ancillary study.
Methods—DNA samples were available from 1057 OHTS participants. Of these, 209 developed 
POAG (cases) and 848 did not develop glaucoma (controls) between 1994 and 2009. The 
frequencies of 13 risk alleles previously associated with POAG or with optic disc features in other 
cohorts were compared between POAG cases and controls in the OHTS cohort using ANOVA. 
The two largest subgroups non-Hispanic whites (n = 752; 70.7%) and blacks (n = 249, 23.7%) 
were also analyzed separately. The probability of developing glaucoma over the course of the 
OHTS was compared between participants stratified for TMCO1 risk alleles using Kaplan-Meier 
and Cox proportional hazards analyses.
Main Outcome Measures—Association of POAG with known genetic factors.
Results—No association was detected between the known POAG risk alleles when the OHTS 
cohort was examined as a whole. However, in the subgroup of non-Hispanic whites, allele 
frequencies at the TMCO1 locus were statistically different between cases and controls (p =

 0.00028). By 13 years, non-Hispanic white participants with TMCO1 risk alleles had a 12% 
higher cumulative frequency of developing glaucoma than participants with no TMCO1 risk 
alleles. Moreover, the Cox proportional hazard analysis demonstrated that TMCO1 alleles increase 
relative risk comparable to that of some previously analyzed clinical measures (i.e. intraocular 
pressure).
Conclusions—The size of the OHTS cohort and its composition of two large racial subgroups 
may limit its power to detect some glaucoma risk factors. However, TMCO1 genotype was found 
to increase risk for developing glaucoma among non-Hispanic whites, the largest racial subgroup 
in the OHTS cohort, at a magnitude similar to clinical predictors of disease that have long been 
associated with glaucoma.
INTRODUCTION
Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a common cause of blindness and visual 
disability. 1–3 POAG is characterized by retinal ganglion cell death that produces a 
distinctive pattern of optic nerve head damage (cupping) and visual field loss. Four classic 
risk factors for glaucoma include increasing age, family history of disease, race, and elevated 
intraocular pressure (IOP).4
Heredity is important in pathogenesis of POAG, however, the genetic basis of glaucoma is 
complex.5 Some cases of POAG are caused primarily by mutations in a single gene, such as 
myocilin (MYOC),6 optineurin (OPTN),7 or TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1).8 Mutations in 
these glaucoma-causing genes are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and have high 
penetrance. The vast majority of individuals with mutations in these genes develop 
glaucoma. Consequently, such mutations are only rarely observed in healthy individuals (i.e. 
those not known to have glaucoma). Mutations in MYOC cause POAG that is characterized 
by high IOP,9 while mutations in OPTN or TBK1 are associated with POAG that typically 
occurs at low IOP.7, 8 Together these genes are responsible for approximately 5% of POAG 
cases.5
Other cases of POAG are caused by the combined actions of many genes and environmental 
factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of glaucoma patients have begun to 
identify these genetic risk factors. The first glaucoma risk factor, CAV1/CAV2, was detected 
by a large GWAS of POAG patients from Iceland.10 Additional POAG risk factors 
(CDKN2B-AS1 and TMCO1) were detected by a GWAS that included especially severe 
cases of POAG.11 Other GWAS confirmed that CAV1/CAV2,12 CDKN2B–AS1,13–16 and 
TMCO117 are POAG risk alleles and identified more factors including ATOH7,13 SIX1/
SIX6,13, 16 and GAS7.17 More recently additional factors (ABCA1,18, 19 AFAP1,18 
GMDS,18 PMM2,19 FNDC3B,20, 21 TGFBR3,22 TXNRD2,23 ATXN2,23 and FOXC123) 
have been detected by GWAS with larger cohort sizes
GWAS of normal tension glaucoma patients have identified additional risk factors for 
glaucoma that occurs at IOP levels at or below population norms including SRBD1.24 
Another potential risk factor, ELOVL5, nearly met genome-wide threshold for 
significance24 and was later studied in targeted association studies suggesting it may also be 
a glaucoma risk factor.25 TLR4 has also been identified as risk factor for normal tension

 glaucoma with some,26, 27 but not all, 28, 29 association studies focused on this gene. Further 
GWAS of normal tension glaucoma have detected a novel chromosome 8q22 locus15 and 
have also shown that a locus previously identified with studies of POAG with high IOP, 
CDKN2B–AS1, is also associated with normal tension glaucoma.15
The genetic basis of quantitative features or endophenotypes of glaucoma has also been 
investigated using GWAS. Several genes that influence the magnitude of vertical cup-to-disc 
ratio (CDKN2B-AS1, SIX1/SIX6, SCYL1, CHEK2, ATOH7, and DCLK1) or optic disc 
area (ATOH7, CDC7/TGFBR3, and SALL1) were identified in early endophenotype studies 
of glaucoma.30, 31 More recent GWAS have detected additional genetic factors that 
determine optic disc features.32 Similar studies have also identified many genetic factors 
associated with other endophenotypes of glaucoma including the magnitude of IOP17, 20 and 
central corneal thickness.21, 33–35 There is some overlap between the genes identified by 
GWAS of endophenotypes and GWAS of glaucoma overall.
Elevated IOP in the absence of diagnostic features of glaucoma (optic nerve damage and/or 
visual field loss) is classified as ocular hypertension (OHT).36 The Ocular Hypertension 
Treatment Study (OHTS) was a multicenter treatment trial that investigated the efficacy of 
medical treatment of OHT to prevent development of POAG.36 Of the 1,636 individuals with 
ocular hypertension that were enrolled in the OHTS, 19% developed POAG at 13 years of 
follow up between 1994 and 2009.37 Here we report investigating the role of 10 previously 
reported glaucoma risk alleles and 3 alleles associated with optic nerve features in the 
participants of the OHTS. We tested OHTS participants at SNPs located in a total of 13 loci. 
Six of these loci were discovered with genome-wide association studies of POAG with high 
IOP (ATOH7, CAV1/CAV2, CDKN2B-AS1, GAS7, SIX1/SIX6, and TMCO1). We also 
tested SNPs in five loci that have been associated with glaucoma that occurs with low IOP 
(CDKN2B-AS1, Chromosome 8q22, ELOVL5, SRBD1, and TLR4), one of which is also 
associated with glaucoma with high IOP. Finally, we evaluated SNPs at 6 loci that influence 
optic disc features (ATOH7, CDC7/TGFBR3, CDKN2B-AS1, CHEK1, SALL1, SIX1/
SIX6), three of which are also associated with POAG. Since the onset of our study of these 
13 factors, additional POAG risk factors have been detected but were not included in our 
analysis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patient cohort
Informed consent was obtained from all participants and approval for the study was granted 
by the Institutional Review Boards of all participating institutions. A total of 1,636 
individuals with ocular hypertension were enrolled in the Ocular Hypertension Treatment 
Study (OHTS) with inclusion and exclusion criteria that have been previously described.36 
Briefly, participants were required to have ocular hypertension defined as IOP ≥ 24 mm Hg, 
but ≤ 32 mm Hg in one eye and IOP ≥ 21 mm Hg, but ≤ 32 mm Hg in the other eye at the 
time of enrollment after washout of any topical glaucoma medications. OHTS participants 
were also between 40 and 80 years of age inclusively and had normal and reliable baseline 
visual fields as determined by Humphrey 30–2 visual field testing and review by the OHTS 
Visual Field Reading center. Finally, OHTS participants were judged to have normal optic

 nerve heads by both clinicians and review of stereoscopic optic disc photos by the OHTS 
Optic Disc Reading Center. At the time of enrollment, all participants were judged to have 
ocular hypertension and none had been diagnosed with glaucoma. The demographics, 
including self-reported ethnicity, of the entire OHTS cohort have been previously 
described.36
A subset (n=1,077) of the 1,636 subjects of the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study 
(OHTS) were enrolled in an ancillary genetics study. Informed consent for genetic studies 
was obtained from all study participants. DNA was obtained from peripheral blood samples 
using standard methods38 and high quality DNA samples was obtained from 1,063 (98.7%) 
of the 1,077 participants. The analysis sample investigated in the current study is described 
in Figure 1.
OHTS participants were examined bi-annually for the development of POAG using a well-
described set of criteria for optic nerve damage and/or visual field defects.36 By 2009, 209 
(19.7%) of the 1063 participants that contributed DNA samples for genetic study had met 
study criteria for a diagnosis of glaucoma.
Genotyping
The cohort of 1063 OHTS participants that contributed DNA samples was studied as part of 
a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to search for genes that determine quantitative 
features of glaucoma. Participants were genotyped at 1.1 million single nucleotide 
polymorphisms using Illumina Omni-1M-Quad microarrays (Illumina, San Diego, CA) in 
collaboration with the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR cidr.jhmi.edu) and the 
National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI genome.gov). An additional 24 
masked duplicate samples and 50 control samples from the International HapMap Project 
were also genotyped to aid with quality control. All DNA samples were genotyped at the 
same time, on the same genotyping platform, and were plated in random order. Quality 
control and data cleaning of the genotypic data was conducted in collaboration with CIDR. 
A total of six participants were excluded from this analysis due to unexpected duplicate 
enrollment (n=2), ethnicity classification errors (n=1), and unexpected relatedness (n=3) The 
genotypes generated from the remaining 1057 samples all passed quality control thresholds 
with overall call rates > 87.9%. Individual SNPs that produced genotypes with call rates < 
99% or that produced Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium < 10−6 were eliminated from the 
study. Concordance of genotype calls between duplicate samples was 99.99% for masked 
OHTS duplicates and 99.7% for HapMap controls. Genotypes from 905,636 of the SNPs on 
the Omni-1M-Quad microarrays satisfied all quality control criteria for the 1057 study 
participants and were released by CIDR and have been posted at dbGaP on the National 
Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
Power Calculations
We calculated that our sample of 209 participants who were diagnosed with POAG (cases) 
and 848 participants who were not diagnosed with POAG has greater than 80% power to 
detect a 7.2% difference in risk factor allele frequency between cases and controls when the

 minor allele frequency is 10% among controls. The Bonferroni method was used to correct 
p-values for multiple measures at an overall significance of 0.05.
Analysis of genotypes
Genotypes of 1057 OHTS participants were further analyzed using GenomeStudio 
(Illumina, San Diego, CA) and PLINK v1.07. Multiple dimensional scaling was used as a 
covariate in linear regression to control for possible population stratification and was 
compared with self-reported ethnicity. Age and gender were also included as covariates.
Of 20 SNPs at 13 loci previously associated with POAG, 10 SNPS were present on the 
Omni1-Quad microarray and genotypes were readily available for analysis. For the 
remaining 10 SNPs, an alternate SNP was chosen using the HapMap linkage disequilibrium 
data (release 27). There were two cases where a single SNP replaced a pair of SNPs in the 
TLR4 gene. Using these alternates resulted in examining 20 unique SNPs at 13 previously 
associated loci (Table 2).
Statistical Analysis
The allele frequencies of 20 SNPs at 13 loci were compared between OHTS participants 
who developed POAG (n = 209) and those who did not develop POAG (n = 848) at 13 years 
follow-up using a Mantel-Haenszel test to control for race. The allele frequencies of these 
SNPs in the two largest sub-populations (self-reported blacks n = 249 and non-Hispanic 
whites n = 752) were also compared separately using a chi square test. A gene-based (n = 
13) Bonferroni correction for multiple measures was used to set the threshold for 
significance at p = 0.05 / 13 = 0.0038.
The risk for glaucoma was assessed using the Kaplan Meier survival analysis and Cox 
proportional hazards analysis. The proportion of OHTS participants that remained free of 
glaucoma at 6 month intervals was assessed for those initially randomized to treatment or 
observation. We calculated the Cox proportional hazard for POAG using the software 
package R (The R Project for Statistical Computing, http://www.r-project.org) with the same 
covariates as previously used to assess risk in the OHTS cohort. These covariates include: 1) 
age at enrollment; 2) IOP at enrollment (average between right and left eyes); 3) central 
corneal thickness (average between right and left eyes); 4) vertical cup-to-disc ratio at 
enrollment (average between right and left eyes); 5) pattern standard deviation of Humphrey 
visual field testing at enrollment (average between right and left eyes). We added 
randomization to treatment or observation at enrollment; gender; and presence of TMCO1 
risk alleles to the Cox proportional hazard model.
RESULTS
Study participants
A total of 1,636 participants were enrolled in the OHTS, and DNA samples were available 
from a subset of this cohort (n=1077). These 1077 OHTS participants were genotyped at 
1,051,295 SNPs as part of a quantitative traits study. After quality control criteria were 
applied, 905,636 SNPs typed in 1063 participants were released for analysis. An additional 6

 participants were removed from the study due to inadvertent duplicate enrollment in the 
OHTS (n=2); due to excess relatedness (n=3); and due to an ethnicity misclassification 
(n=1). The remaining 1057 OHTS participants and their genotypes are the focus of this 
study (Figure 1).
The demographic information from 1057 OHTS subjects in the genetics study is shown in 
Table 1. The racial composition of this subset of the OHTS is 71.1% non-Hispanic white and 
23.6% black and is similar to the entire OHTS cohort as previously described.58 Over the 
course of 13 years of follow-up examinations, 209 (19.8%) of these 1057 OHTS participants 
met study criteria for a diagnosis of POAG, while 848 (80.2%) were not diagnosed with 
glaucoma.
Analysis of previously reported genetic factors for POAG
Prior studies have reported associations between SNPs at nineteen loci and POAG (including 
normal tension glaucoma). Many additional loci associated with endophenotypes of 
glaucoma such as vertical cup-to-disc ratio have also been identified. We examined the role 
of SNPs at 13 loci that had been discovered at the time of our study’s onset. SNPs at 10 loci 
associated with POAG were investigated in our study (ATOH7,13 CAV1/CAV2,12 
CDKN2B–AS1,13–16 CHR 8q22,15 ELOVL5,24 GAS7,17 SIX1/SIX6,13, 16 SRBD1,24 
TLR4,26, 27 and TMCO117) and POAG. Of these 10 loci, CDKN2B–AS1, CHR 8q22, 
ELOVL5, SRBD1, and TLR4 have been associated with normal tension glaucoma. We also 
investigated six loci that have been associated with optic disc features (i.e. disc area or 
vertical cup-to-disk ratio) ATOH7, CDC7/TGFBR3,13, 39 CDKN2B–AS1, CHEK2,40 
SALL1,13 and SIX1/SIX6 (three of which are also associated with POAG). Genotype 
frequencies at each of these 13 loci were compared between 209 OHTS participants that 
were diagnosed with POAG and 848 OHTS participants who were not diagnosed with 
glaucoma using linear regression controlling for population stratification, gender, and age as 
covariates. When the entire OHTS cohort (n=1057) was analyzed (Table 2), no SNPs at 
these 13 loci were associated with POAG with a threshold for significance corrected for 
multiple measures (p < 0.0038).
The OHTS cohort includes participants from several racial and ethnic groups (Table 1), 
however, the two largest subgroups are self-reported Non-Hispanic whites (n=752) and 
blacks (n=249). When these groups were analyzed separately (Table 2), one locus (TMCO1) 
contained a SNP (rs4656461) with allele frequencies that were significantly associated with 
POAG among the Non-Hispanic white subset of participants. The minor allele frequency of 
rs4656461 was 24.6% in non-Hispanic whites that developed POAG and 15.5% in those that 
did not develop POAG (p = 0.00028). Numerous clinical studies have established that age, 
IOP, and CCT are important risk factors for POAG. However, TMCO1 genotypes were not 
associated with age, IOP, or CCT in the OHTS cohort (p > 0.05), suggesting that TMCO1 is 
an independent risk factor for POAG. Moreover, the association between TMCO1 and 
POAG in non-Hispanic white participants remained significant (p = 0.000072) when the data 
were reanalyzed using age, gender, IOP, and CCT as covariates, further indicating that 
TMCO1 is independently associated with POAG in the OHTS cohort.

 Assessment of risk for POAG conferred by TMCO1 alleles at the rs4656461 locus
At the onset of the OHTS, all participants were determined to be free of glaucoma damage. 
Over the course of the first 13 years of follow-up, 209 of 1057 participants who contributed 
DNA samples developed incident cases of POAG. At 13 years, 59 (29.6%) of the 199 OHTS 
participants with TMCO1 risk alleles still in the study had glaucoma, while 69 (19.1%) of 
the remaining 362 participants without TMCO1 risk alleles had glaucoma. Overall, the 
proportion of participants with glaucoma at 13 years was 10.5% greater in OHTS 
participants with TMCO1 risk alleles than in those with no risk alleles.
The rate at which POAG was diagnosed was compared between OHTS participants with 
TMCO1 risk alleles (either one or both alleles) and participants with no risk alleles using a 
modified Kaplan-Meier analysis (Figure 2A). Carriers of one or two TMCO1 risk alleles 
were grouped together, because of the relative rarity of participants with two risk alleles. 
Overall, participants with TMCO1 risk alleles developed glaucoma at a higher rate than 
participants with no risk alleles (p = 0.0128). By 13 years, OHTS participants with TMCO1 
risk alleles have a 30.2% probability of developing glaucoma compared with a probability of 
22.3% for those with no TMCO1 risk alleles (Figure 2A). Thus, TMCO1 risk alleles are 
associated with a 7.9% higher probability for developing glaucoma at 13 years.
Reduction of IOP is known to influence the risk for developing glaucoma. Consequently, we 
compared TMCO1 risk allele frequencies between the subset of the OHTS participants that 
was randomized to initially receive IOP lowering medications and the subset that was 
randomized to initially receive placebo (Table 3). TMCO1 risk allele frequencies are the 
same in treated and untreated arms of the OHTS (p = 0.35). Moreover, the same trend of 
increased rates of glaucoma among carriers of TMCO1 risk alleles was observed when 
either initially treated or untreated subsets of the OHTS participants were investigated 
separately with Kaplan-Meier analysis (Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B).
The two largest racial subsets of the OHTS participants (non-Hispanic whites and blacks) 
were also studied separately with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Non-Hispanic whites that carried 
one or two TMCO1 risk alleles developed glaucoma at a statistically higher rate than those 
with no risk alleles (Figure 2B, p = 0.0014). These data show that after 13 years, non-
Hispanic whites with high-risk TMCO1 alleles have a 28.8% probability of having glaucoma 
compared with a probability of 17.1% for those with no TMCO1 risk alleles (Figure 2B). 
These data suggest that TMCO1 risk alleles are responsible for an 11.7% higher probability 
for developing glaucoma at 13 years. Further, Kaplan-Meier analysis shows that TMCO1 
risk alleles are associated with a higher risk for developing glaucoma in both the initially 
treated (p = 0.00909) or untreated (p = 0.0304) subgroups of Non-Hispanic whites 
(Supplemental Figures 1A and 1B). No statistically significant difference in the rate of 
glaucoma was detected between the smaller cohorts of black OHTS participants with 
TMCO1 risk alleles and black participants with no risk alleles.

 OHTS cohort included 1) age, 2) IOP, 3) central corneal thickness, 4) vertical cup-to-disc 
ratio, and 5) pattern standard deviation of Humphrey visual field tests. We added initial 
randomization to treatment or observation, gender and TMCO1 genotype to our POAG risk 
calculator. We focused our analysis on the non-Hispanic white subset of the OHTS 
participants (n = 752) for which TMCO1 alleles are significantly associated with POAG. In 
this model, TMCO1 genotype is highly associated with risk for POAG (Table 4). TMCO1 
risk alleles have a hazards ratio of 1.73 per allele (p-value = 0.00036) and have an influence 
on risk for glaucoma that is on par with other clinical and demographic features of glaucoma 
(Table 4). A similar analysis with the black subset of the OHTS cohort did not produce 
hazards ratios that were statistically significant (p=0.085).
DISCUSSION
Observational and epidemiological studies have provided strong evidence for genetic 
contributions to both the overall risk for a clinical diagnosis of glaucoma as well as many of 
the component quantitative features of disease, such as corneal thickness, IOP, and optic disc 
morphology.41–45 The first successes in genetic studies of glaucoma were achieved with 
investigations of Mendelian (single-gene) forms of POAG. Linkage studies of rare pedigrees 
identified mutations in genes (e.g. MYOC, OPTN, and TBK1) that are each capable of 
causing glaucoma with little influence from other genes and the environment.5 Risk factors 
have also been discovered for forms of glaucoma that have a complex basis involving many 
genes that contribute to pathogenesis but are not causative on their own. For example, the 
LOXL1 locus has been identified as a powerful risk factor for exfoliation syndrome (odds 
ratio >20) and exfoliation glaucoma.46 Several POAG risk factors have also been discovered 
including CAV1/CAV2,10 CDKN2B–AS1,11, 13, 15, 47 TMCO1,11 ATOH7,13 SIX1/SIX6,13 
GAS7,17 TLR4,26 SRBD1,25 E LOVL5,25 chromosome 8q22,15 ABCA1,18 AFAP1,18 
GMDS,18 P MM2,19 FNDC3B,20, 21 TGFBR3,22 TXNRD2,23 ATXN2,23 and FOXC1.23 
Each of these POAG risk factors was discovered with case control association studies that 
provide estimates of their influence on the development of glaucoma (i.e. odds ratios). These 
factors each confer relatively modest risk for POAG, which suggests that numerous risk 
factors (genetic and environmental) must be present for disease to occur and that many more 
factors remain to be discovered.
The known glaucoma risk factors have been studied and further validated in patient cohorts 
from prior epidemiological studies and treatment trials. Members of the Nurses Health Study 
(NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) were screened for glaucoma 
and included in multicenter POAG genetic studies (GLAUGEN and NEIGHBOR). 
Associations between CDKN2B-AS1 and SIX1/SIX6 were validated with these cohorts and 
a new chromosome 8q22 risk factor locus was discovered.15 The Blue Mountain Eye Study 
(BMES) examined a cohort of 3,654 predominantly white residents of a suburb of Sydney to 
determine the prevalence of glaucoma in this population (2.4% definite glaucoma).48 Later 
DNA samples from BMES participants were used in the initial GWAS study that discovered 
an association between risk factors TMCO1 and CDKN2B–AS1 and POAG.11 Furthermore 
a subset of the BMES participants were followed over 10 years for the development of 
incident cases of POAG. In a recent report, a focused association study of BMES 
participants confirmed the association between several previously discovered risk factors and

 incident cases of glaucoma in the BMES cohort. SNPs in CDKN2B–AS1 (rs141829), and 
SIX1/SIX6 (rs10483727) were each associated with increased risk for developing glaucoma 
with calculated odds ratios (univariate) of 1.67 and 1.66 respectively.49 A marginal 
association between TMCO1 and incident glaucoma was also detected with an odds ratio of 
1.74 (univariate) but did not survive multiple measures corrections.49
Our analysis of the OHTS cohort identified a significant association between TMCO1 risk 
alleles and incident glaucoma cases among white participants. It is likely that the association 
was detected in whites and not in black participants primarily due to larger sample size 
(Table 1). There is 9.1% difference in TMCO1 minor allele frequency of SNP rs4656461 
between non-Hispanic whites with POAG and non-Hispanic whites with no POAG in the 
OHTS. If the same difference in minor allele frequency were observed in the smaller cohort 
of black OHTS participants, there would only be 36% power to detect a statistically 
significant difference at this locus. This low power suggests that small sample size might be 
one reason that an association was not detected between TMCO1 and glaucoma in the black 
subset of the OHTS participants. It is also notable that the minor allele at the TMCO1 locus 
(rs4656461) that is associated with glaucoma in non-Hispanic whites is more common 
among blacks without glaucoma (controls) than among blacks with glaucoma (Table 2). 
These data suggest that if there were an association between TMC01 and glaucoma in blacks 
that could be detectable with a larger cohort, the association would likely be in the opposite 
direction (i.e. with the major allele at rs4656461). Moreover, some of the other SNPs in our 
study, such as rs1063192 and SNP9–22023366 at the CDKN2B-AS1 locus, have much 
lower minor allele frequencies in black participants than in non-Hispanic white participants 
which may have also challenged our ability to detect statistically significant differences. It is 
interesting to note, that these same CDKN2B-AS1 SNP alleles that are less common in 
blacks are “protective” and reduce risk for glaucoma and could be a source of the increased 
risk for glaucoma among blacks. Finally, other studies of African blacks have suggested that 
known glaucoma risk alleles may not be as strong in these populations and that a different 
set of risk factors may be more important.50 Our analysis of black OHTS participants is 
consistent with this conclusion.
Our failure to detect significant associations with additional known glaucoma risk factors is 
most likely due to the relatively small size of the OHTS cohort. For example, nominal 
associations were detected at the CDKN2B-AS1 locus (p = 0.0060) that didn’t survive 
multiple measures corrections for 13 loci. It is possible that an association between 
CDKN2B–AS1 or other factors might have been detectable if the OHTS cohort were larger 
or if less stringent multiple measures corrections were employed.
Although TMCO1 was first associated with POAG,11 it was later identified as a gene that 
regulates the magnitude of IOP. 17, 51 Consequently, we considered that the association 
between TMCO1 and glaucoma might be influenced by IOP. However, TMCO1 remains 
associated with POAG in the OHTS cohort even when baseline IOP is controlled using 
linear regression. These results suggest that TMCO1 may contribute risk for glaucoma that 
is independent of its influence on IOP. Since both the POAG cases and controls in the OHTS 
cohort were required to have high IOP through enrollment criteria, our analyses may be 
poorly suited to detecting IOP-dependent risk for POAG.

 Since this analysis of 13 loci was begun, several additional SNPs associated with POAG 
have been identified with studies of larger patient cohorts (ABAC1, AFAP1, GMDS, PMM2, 
FNDC3B, TGFBR3, TXNRD2, ATXN2, and FOXC1). Future studies of these additional 
genes with the OHTS cohort may be warranted.
The primary goal of the OHTS randomized trial was to determine the safety and efficacy of 
medical reduction of IOP reduction on the risk for developing glaucoma. Rigorous 
longitudinal assessments for incident cases of glaucoma were conducted at 6-month 
intervals for over 13 years and demonstrated that IOP reduction lowers risk for progression 
of ocular hypertension to POAG. We were able to use the same glaucoma incidence dataset 
to determine the influence of TMCO1 risk alleles on glaucoma incidence. Analysis of non-
Hispanic white OHTS participants demonstrated that those with one or two TMCO1 risk 
alleles developed glaucoma at a significantly higher rate than those with no risk alleles (p = 
0.0014, Figure 2B). After 13 years, 12% more of the non-Hispanic whites with TMCO1 risk 
alleles developed POAG than non-Hispanic whites without risk alleles. Half of the OHTS 
participants were randomized to initial observation and half to IOP reduction therapy. 
TMCO1 alleles influence risk for glaucoma when initially-observed or initially-treated 
groups are analyzed separately (Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B).
The OHTS cohort TMCO1 genotype data was also examined with Cox proportional hazards 
models similar to those used in prior studies.52 In addition to the clinical predictors used in 
the original model, our calculator included three more factors: 1) number of TMCO1 risk 
alleles, 2) gender, and 3) initial randomization (observation or treatment). The number of 
TMCO1 risk alleles is highly associated with development of glaucoma (p = 0.00036). In 
our model each TMCO1 risk allele has a hazard ratio of 1.73 and confers risk for glaucoma 
greater than the risk associated with a 0.1 larger baseline cup-to-disc ratio or with a 40 
micron thinner baseline corneal thickness (Table 4).
Genetic analysis of the OHTS cohort provides evidence that TMCO1 genotype is a strong 
predictor for the development of glaucoma. This analysis of TMCO1 is based on individuals 
with ocular hypertension and may not be generalizable to all types of glaucoma suspects, 
however, its conclusions are supported by Burdon and coworkers recent study of incident 
cases of POAG in the BMES.49 Both Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportion hazards 
models suggest that determining TMCO1 genotype might have clinical utility in assessing 
risk for glaucoma. The potential value of including TMCO1 genotypes in a glaucoma risk 
calculator is promising, but requires additional validation.

 Figure 2. Kaplan-Meier analysis of OHTS participants with TMCO1 glaucoma risk factors
At the onset of the study, none of the OHTS participants had a diagnosis of glaucoma. At 
six-month intervals participants were evaluated for onset of glaucoma. Survival probability, 
which refers to the probability of remaining free of glaucoma, is plotted on the Y-axis. Thus, 
the probability of developing glaucoma is equal to 1 – the probability of survival. Survival 
probability for participants with no TMCO1 risk alleles is plotted with a solid line, while 
survival probability for participants with either 1 or 2 TMCO1 risk alleles is plotted with a 
dashed line. A. Data plotted from all participants in the genetics ancillary study of the OHTS

TMCO1 risk alleles are present at the same frequency among OHTS participants randomized to initial treatment or to initial observation when the whole cohort is analyzed (left columns). The TMCO1 risk 
alleles are also present at the same frequency in white participants randomized to initial treatment or initial observation (middle columns), while their was a difference between groups among the black 
participants (right columns) which is likely due to the smaller sample size.
