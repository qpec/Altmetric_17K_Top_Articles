Sufentanil sublingual tablet 30 mcg in the ED 
 
ABSTRACT 
Background: Pharmacological properties of the sufentanil sublingual tablet 30 mcg (SST 30 mcg) could 
offer potential analgesic advantages in settings requiring noninvasive, acute pain management. The 
feasibility of using SST 30 mcg for moderate-to-severe pain management in the emergency department 
(ED) was evaluated. 
Methods: This open-label, multicenter feasibility study included patients aged ≥18 years who presented 
to the ED with moderate-to-severe pain (≥4 on the numeric rating scale of pain intensity (NRS); opioid-
tolerant patients were excluded. Patients received a single SST 30-mcg dose (single-dose cohort) or, 
upon request, ≤3 additional doses ≥60 minutes apart (multiple-dose cohort) and were evaluated over 1 
or 2 hours. Effectiveness was assessed by patient-reported pain scores (11-point NRS; 5-point pain relief 
scale). Safety and tolerability were also assessed.  
Results: Overall, 76 patients enrolled into the single-dose (n = 40) and multiple-dose (n = 36) cohorts. In 
the first hour (combined cohorts), mean pain intensity was significantly lower 15-minutes post-dosing (P 
<.001; clinically meaningful within 30-minutes post-dosing) and continued to decrease during the first 
hour (P <.001 for each 15-minute interval). Mean pain intensity (multiple-dose cohort) decreased from 
7.6 at baseline to 4.5 at 1 hour and to 4.6 at 2 hours (P <.001 for both); mean pain relief increased from 
baseline to 1.9 at 1 hour (P <.001) and to 2.0 at 2 hours (P <.001). Most (79%) patients had no adverse 
events (AEs), and there were no severe AEs. 
Conclusions: SST 30 mcg was feasible for managing moderate-to-severe acute pain in an ED setting.

1. 
INTRODUCTION   
Pain is the most common reason people visit the emergency department (ED). Studies indicate however, 
that ED physicians often do not provide adequate analgesia to their patients as a result of time 
constraints, gender and age bias, opiophobia, and insufficient formal training in acute pain management 
[1]. Often, these patients are suffering from moderate-to-severe pain, have long delays before obtaining 
pain relief, and are discharged in a significant degree of pain. In a study of more than 800 patients 
treated in 20 EDs with a baseline pain score of 8 out of 10, patients incurred a median delay of 90 
minutes to receive an analgesic, with only 60% of patients receiving any analgesic at all; overall, three-
quarters of patients were discharged with moderate-to-severe pain [2]. A recent study showed that 
difficult intravenous (IV) placement requiring advanced techniques, such as ultrasound guidance, further 
increased the time to successful IV placement by 118–135 minutes [3]. Demonstrating the benefit of 
early pain management, a study of over 2000 ED patients demonstrated that more rapid administration 
of analgesics was associated with shorter lengths of stay [4].  
 
A commonly used treatment for moderate-to-severe pain is IV opioids, but IV drug administration 
requires significant ED resources (bed, nurse, equipment, etc) which may be limited during busy periods, 
thereby presenting a significant barrier in terms of time delay to pain treatment in the ED [5]. While oral 
opioids require fewer resources to administer, the time to onset and titratability of oral opioids limit 
their use in severe pain [6]. Novel classes of analgesics have recently been introduced, but many 
patients still suffer from acute pain in situations where immediate IV access may be unavailable [7].  
 
The sufentanil sublingual tablet (SST) 30 mcg (SST 30 mcg), dispensed using a single-dose applicator, is 
being studied in clinical trials for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain in short-term use 
settings, such as the ED and ambulatory surgery centers. SST 30 mcg, developed to take advantage of 
the unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of sufentanil following sublingual 
administration (avoids first-pass metabolism, short time of onset as reflected by a plasma:brain 
equilibrium half–life [t1/2ke0] of 6.2 minutes, and no active metabolites), could offer potential analgesic 
advantages in settings requiring noninvasive, acute pain management [8–12]. 
 
Several clinical safety and efficacy trials of SST (15-mcg and 30-mcg doses) have demonstrated favorable 
tolerability in post-operative patients [13–16]. However, because SST 30 mcg has the potential to treat 
pain in other acute settings where safety has not been studied, the purpose of this open-label study was

to determine the feasibility of using SST 30 mcg in patients in the ED, as they represent a relatively 
unique patient population. 
 
2. 
METHODS 
This single-arm, multicenter, open-label feasibility trial was conducted at 3 hospitals in the United States 
(Hennepin County Medical Center, Minneapolis; Memorial Hermann-Memorial City Medical Center, 
Houston; and Ben Taub General Hospital, Houston). The study was registered with clinicaltrials.gov 
(NCT02447848) in May 2015. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board for each 
study site, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The study was conducted 
under the International Conference on Harmonisation, Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical 
Practice (International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of 
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use; http://www.ich.org/home.html ) and the Guidelines of the Declaration 
of Helsinki (64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013; 
http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/).  
 
2.1. 
Primary inclusion and exclusion criteria 
Male and nonpregnant female patients aged ≥18 years who presented to the ED with moderate-to-
severe pain due to obvious trauma or injury on physical examination, who were classified as American 
Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical class І–ІІІ [17,18], and were willing and capable of 
understanding and cooperating with the requirements of the study were eligible for inclusion. Patients 
were excluded if they were opioid tolerant (>15 mg oral morphine sulfate-equivalent daily); used illicit 
drugs of abuse, abused prescription medication or alcohol, or were dependent on supplemental oxygen; 
had an allergy or hypersensitivity to opioids; or had a medical condition—in the opinion of the 
investigator—that could adversely affect the patient’s participation or safety, study conduct, or interfere 
with pain assessments (including chronic pain or active infection). Prior to dosing, patients were 
additionally excluded if they were not awake, not breathing spontaneously; were unable to answer 
questions and follow commands; or had a respiratory rate <8 or >24 breaths per minute. 
 
2.2. 
Study treatment and rescue medication 
Eligible patients reporting a moderate-to-severe pain intensity score of ≥4 (0–10 numeric rating scale, 
where 0 represents no pain and 10 represents the worst possible pain) received their SST 30-mcg dose 
sublingually by a healthcare professional (HCP) [19,20]. The initial patients entering the study (the first

Sufentanil sublingual tablet 30 mcg in the ED 
 
40 patients) received a single dose only (single-dose cohort), with subsequent patients (36 patients) 
being able to receive additional doses if needed for pain (multiple-dose cohort).  
 
Patients in both cohorts could receive, only upon request by the patient, rescue opioid medication (oral 
oxycodone elixir; Oxyfast 5 mg/5 mL at 0.1 mg/kg or IV morphine [0.05 mg/kg] if they had an IV catheter 
in place) ≥10 minutes after dosing with SST 30 mcg. All patients could receive rescue medication starting 
10 minutes after their first SST 30-mcg dose. Patients in the single-dose cohort were restricted to a 
single SST 30-mcg dose and remained in the study for up to 2 hours to accommodate safety 
assessments; after 1 hour, since study drug was no longer available, patients in the single-dose cohort 
could receive other analgesics if required. Patients in the multiple-dose cohort could receive, upon 
request, up to 3 additional SST 30-mcg doses ≥60 minutes apart, up to 5 hours. Since study drug was 
available hourly, only the pre-specified rescue opioid medication per the patient’s request could be 
utilized to treat inadequate analgesia in this cohort.   
 
2.3. 
Effectiveness and safety assessments included in the analysis 
Effectiveness was assessed by patient reports of pain intensity on the 11-point numeric rating scale (0 = 
no pain; 10 = worst possible pain) and a 5-point pain relief scale (0 = no relief; 1 = a little relief; 2 = 
moderate relief; 3 = a lot of relief; 4 = complete relief). In addition, all HCPs who administered SST 30 
mcg to ≥3 patients answered a Study Drug Administration Questionnaire (Supplementary Fig. S1) at the 
end of the study. 
 
Patient-reported pain intensity was initially recorded by HCPs at baseline prior to dosing. Pain intensity 
and pain relief scores were then obtained at 15-minute intervals for the first 45 minutes, followed by 
every hour (from 1–5 hours) following the first dose of SST 30 mcg. Effectiveness endpoints included the 
time-weighted summed pain intensity difference [21–25] from baseline over the first hour of treatment, 
and individual pain intensity and pain relief scores at designated timepoints, compared with baseline. 
Overall satisfaction with SST 30 mcg as a method of pain control (indicated as “poor”, “fair”, “good”, or 
“excellent”) was evaluated at the time of study discontinuation for the multiple-dose cohort via patient 
and HCP global assessments (PGA and HPGA, respectively) [26–28].  
 
Other effectiveness endpoints included the proportion of patients who required rescue medication 
while receiving SST 30 mcg (ie, in the first hour for the single-dose cohort and throughout the study for 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

the multiple-dose cohort), the proportion of patients terminated from the study due to inadequate 
analgesia; and the total number of doses of study and rescue medication used. 
 
Safety was monitored via periodic measurement of vital signs (ie, respiratory rate, radial pulse rate, and 
blood pressure) and continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation (SpO2) via pulse oximetry monitors (but 
was only recorded at the time points when respiratory rates were measured and recorded), per direct 
observation, as well as assessment and recording of spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs; 
including cognitive impairment-associated AEs), and assessment of the use of concomitant medications. 
The study site investigators assessed and described AE severity and relatedness (not related or 
possibly/probably related) to the study drug (Supplementary Text).  
 
Heart rate was measured over 30 seconds and respiratory rate was measured over 1 minute. 
Respiratory rate and other vital signs could be checked at additional times on an ad-hoc basis per clinical 
judgment. SpO2 was measured continuously by pulse oximetry and recorded at predose and every 15 
minutes following drug dosing for the first hour and every 30 minutes thereafter. 
 
A 6-item screener (SIS) [29] was used to detect cognitive impairment and generate a SIS score (0–6). In 
general, SIS scores of 5 and 6 are considered non-impaired and a score <5 is considered as cognitive 
impairment. Assessment of cognitive impairment (eg, confusion, somnolence, memory impairment, and 
reaction time) before and 1 hour after dosing with SST 30 mcg was requested by the United States 
Department of Defense (study sponsor), due to the concern of impaired cognitive skills with other field-
based analgesics used in the military, such as ketamine [30].  
 
2.4. 
Statistical analysis 
A sample size of approximately 120 patients was planned for this analysis based on clinical judgement. 
All enrolled patients who had both baseline and follow-up data were included in the analysis. 
Effectiveness data from the intent-to treat (ITT) population, defined as all patients who received ≥1 dose 
of SST 30 mcg, were summarized by descriptive statistics. All enrolled patients who received at least 1 
dose of SST 30 mcg were included in the analyses and summaries of safety data. Effectiveness data from 
the entire patient population were combined for the first study hour (ie, after the first dose); 
effectiveness data at hour 2 were reported only for the multiple-dosing cohort, as the single-dose cohort 
no longer had access to SST 30 mcg after the first hour. Given the nature of ED studies, a limited number

of patients had available pain data after 2 hours (<10% of patients remained in the study), therefore, 
pain variables by evaluation time point were analyzed only up through the 2-hour study period. 
Subgroup analyses for age (<65 years and ≥65 years), sex (male and female), race (Caucasian and non-
Caucasian), and body mass index (BMI) (<30 kg/m2 and ≥30 kg/m2) were performed for the effectiveness 
endpoint (time-weighted summed pain intensity difference from baseline over the first hour of 
treatment for all enrolled patients). For baseline pain intensity, the least squares (LS) mean and standard 
error of the mean (SEM) were estimated from the analysis of variance model that included each 
subgroup factor, and for the time-weighted summed pain intensity difference from baseline over the 
first hour of treatment, the LS mean and SEM were estimated from the analysis of covariance model 
that included each subgroup factor and baseline pain intensity as a covariate. Pain intensity scores were 
derived from data from the Study Drug Administration Questionnaire.  
 
Patients who had baseline vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and SpO2, 
and at least 1 follow-up data point were included in these analyses of vital signs. Vitals signs taken at 
baseline and follow-up time points, and AEs occurring after patients received the first dose were 
summarized. A paired t-test was used for the test of mean change from baseline to follow-up time 
points within the group. Other safety data, such as termination data and concomitant medications used 
during the study were tabulated. Analyses of all effectiveness and safety data were performed at a 
significance level of α=0.05. 
 
Missing pain intensity or pain relief data were first imputed on a patient-by-patient basis by linear 
interpolation method between 2 observed pain scale values. Missing pain data at follow-up time points 
post-termination up to the end of the study period were imputed on a patient-by-patient basis. If rescue 
analgesics were used, pain scores just prior to dosing with rescue medications were imputed for a 1-
hour time interval. The worst observation carried forward method was used to impute any remaining 
missing data points after termination up to the end of the study period. The worst pain intensity 
difference from baseline was the smaller number between “0” and the last pain intensity difference 
from baseline obtained prior to termination. The worst pain relief was “0”. For patients who enrolled in 
the single-dose cohort, the missing pain intensity and pain relief data after the 2-hour evaluation time 
point was not imputed.

3.1. 
Baseline demographics and patient disposition  
The first patient enrolled October 5, 2015 and the final patient completed the study June 17, 2016. 
Despite the inherent difficulty in recruiting patients in the ED with acute injury or trauma to take part in 
a study of an experimental analgesic, 78 patients in total were ultimately recruited and screened, and 76 
eligible patients were enrolled and included in the ITT population and effectiveness and safety analyses 
(Fig. 1). The initial 40 patients received a single dose of SST 30 mcg; an additional 36 patients enrolled 
and were eligible to receive multiple SST 30-mcg doses. Eleven of 76 total patients terminated prior to 
the end of the 2-hour study period due to either early hospital discharge (n = 4), lack of effectiveness (n 
= 4), exiting hospital before notifying investigators (n = 1), or no longer wanting to take part in the study, 
despite an improvement in pain relief (n = 1); 1 patient did not cite a reason for withdrawal. Overall, 
86% (65/76) of patients from the combined cohort completed 2 hours in the study.  
 
The mean age was 42 years (12% were aged ≥65 years), 61% were male, mean BMI was 30.6, and the 
majority (61%) of patients were ASA Class I (Table 1). The most common types of trauma presented in 
the ED were fractures (33%), sprains/strains (30%), and contusions/soft tissue hematomas (17%). Mean 
baseline pain intensity was 8.1 (on a scale from 1–10). 
 
3.2. 
Study drug dosing 
All patients received at least 1 dose of SST 30 mcg. Of the 36 patients in the multiple-dose cohort, 19% 
(n = 7) received 2 additional doses and 6% (n = 2) received 3 additional doses of SST 30 mcg (mean [SD] 
number of doses: 1.3 [0.6]).  
 
3.3. 
Effectiveness  
3.3.1. Effectiveness within the first hour of study dosing (combined cohorts) 
For the combined cohort over the first hour (n = 76), the mean pain intensity significantly decreased 
from baseline within 15 minutes following initiation of SST 30 mcg (P <.001), and the difference from 
baseline continued to decrease during the first hour of the study period (Fig. 2A). At 60 minutes, pain 
intensity decreased by 2.9 (from 8.08 at baseline to 5.20 at 60 minutes), a drop of 36%. Within the first 
hour of study drug dosing, increases (P <.001 at each timepoint) in pain relief (1.7, on a scale from 0–4) 
were also reported (Fig. 2B).

To evaluate the overall drop in pain intensity in both cohorts between different demographic subgroups, 
the time-weighted summed pain intensity difference from baseline over 1 hour was analyzed by age 
group (<65 vs ≥65 years), sex (male vs female), race (Caucasian vs non-Caucasian), and BMI (<30 vs ≥30 
kg/m2). No significant differences within each subgroup were observed (Table 2). 
 
3.3.2. Effectiveness within the first 2 hours of study dosing (multiple-dose cohort) 
Although study drug was available every hour, the majority (75%; 27/36) of patients in the multiple-dose 
cohort required only 1 dose of SST 30 mcg. Mean pain intensity was 7.6 at baseline and decreased to 4.5 
at 60 minutes and remained relatively stable (4.6) at 2 hours (P <.001 compared to baseline at each 
timepoint) (Fig. 3A). Mean pain relief increased from baseline to 1.9 at 60 minutes and 2.0 at 2 hours (P 
<.001 at each timepoint) (Fig. 3B). 
 
3.3.3. Termination due to inadequate analgesia  
Prior to the end of the 2-hour study period, early termination due to inadequate analgesia occurred for 
4 of 76 patients (5.3%). There were an additional 2 patients in the multiple-dose cohort who remained in 
the study after 2 hours but terminated the study before the 5-hour study period due to inadequate 
analgesia.  
 
3.3.4. Rescue medication 
Overall, rates of rescue opioid usage were low. Only 3 (7.5%) patients in the single-dose cohort utilized 
rescue medication within the first hour. For the multiple-dose cohort (which had access to study drug 
for the full 5-hour study period), 3 (8.3%) patients required rescue medication throughout the study 
period.  
 
3.3.5. Patient and HCP global assessments of methods of pain control 
Of the patients who completed the PGA in the multiple-dose cohort (n=33), the majority responded that 
SST 30 mcg provided “excellent” (n=9, 27.3%) or “good” (n=15, 51.5%) control of their pain (Table 3). 
Similarly, 27 of 36 HCPs responded “excellent” (n=12, 33.3%) or “good” (n=15, 41.7%) on the HPGA at 
the time of discontinuation from the study. 
 
3.3.6. HCP assessment of single-dose applicator for SST 30 mcg administration  
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

Sufentanil sublingual tablet 30 mcg in the ED 
 
The majority of HCPs who administered SST 30 mcg to ≥3 patients indicated that SST 30 mcg was 
“somewhat easy” or “easy” to administer when patients were dosed in an upright (100%; 7/7) or 
reclined (83.4%, 5/6) position, and in limited-lighting situations (85.7%; 6/7). Most HCPs considered the 
single-dose applicator to be “somewhat intuitive” or “intuitive” (85.7%, 6/7), and that, when dispensed, 
the SST 30-mcg tablet was “somewhat detectable” or “detectable” (85.7%; 6/7). 
 
3.4. 
Safety 
3.4.1. Cognitive impairment (SIS Cognitive Test) 
Of the 75 patients who had SIS scores recorded both pre- and post-dosing, 73 (97%) had either the same 
or improved SIS scoring 1 hour after dosing. The remaining 2 patients demonstrated a single-point drop 
in SIS scoring at the 1-hour time point compared with baseline. Of these 2 patients, one was a 47-year-
old male (BMI: 26 kg/m2) who presented with a closed mandible fracture and other facial trauma (ie, 
abrasions, lacerations, and swelling to his left eye and cheek). The other patient was a 26-year-old 
female (BMI: 27 kg/m2) who presented with partial thickness second-degree burns on her left thigh 
(approximately 10 cm in diameter). Both patients had a baseline pain score of 8 (on a scale from 1 to 
10). 
 
3.4.2. Adverse events 
Adverse events were analyzed for both cohorts together. Overall, 79% (60/76) of patients did not incur 
an AE (Table 4). The most frequently (in ≥2% of patients) reported AEs were nausea (9%), somnolence 
(5%), vomiting (4%), and oxygen desaturation (3%). Eleven (15%) patients had ≥1 AE considered possibly 
or probably related to SST 30 mcg. The most frequently reported AEs related to SST 30 mcg were nausea 
(7%) and vomiting (4%). Two patients experienced transient room air oxygen desaturations below 95% 
(88% and 94%) that immediately improved with nasal cannula oxygen; both events were considered 
related to SST 30 mcg. 
 
All AEs were mild, with the exception of 1 event each of angina pectoris (considered possibly treatment-
related by the investigator) and nausea (unrelated to treatment) that were considered moderate in 
severity; there were no severe AEs. The only serious AE (angina pectoris, moderate in severity) occurred 
in a woman aged 65 years with a medical history that was significant for coronary artery disease. No 
patient discontinued the study due to an AE. There were no clinically meaningful changes in mean vital 
signs and no patient required use of naloxone.

DISCUSSION 
 
Results from this open-label feasibility study suggest that SST 30 mcg has potential as a noninvasive (eg, 
not requiring intravenous access) treatment for moderate-to-severe acute pain in patients in an ED 
setting. A single dose resulted in an approximate 3-point decrease in pain intensity within 60 minutes 
(36% reduction from baseline). Significant reductions in pain intensity from baseline were observed as 
early as 15 minutes after the start of SST 30-mcg dosing. Clinically meaningful analgesia—as defined by a 
≥1.3-point reduction on the numeric rating scale for acute pain in the ED [31]—occurred on average in 
less than 20 minutes in the combined cohort. Pain intensity continued to decline through 1 hour post-
dose, and for patients allowed to receive additional doses of study drug after the 1-hour time point, the 
reduction was maintained through 2 hours. Similarly, significant improvements in pain relief were 
observed within 15 minutes, continued until 1 hour, and were maintained through 2 hours after the 
initial dose. Although the majority (75%) of patients in the multiple-dose cohort only required 1 dose of 
study drug (ie, did not re-dose), some of those patients were not available for re-dosing at the 1-hour 
time point (ie, 2 patients were discharged; 1 patient left the hospital early without notifying the 
investigator). For the multiple-dose cohort, there was a significant decrease in pain intensity from 7.6 at 
baseline to 4.5 at 1 hour, and this pain control was maintained at 2 hours. Similarly, there were 
significant increases in pain relief at 1 and 2 hours compared with baseline. Although pain intensity 
remained relatively high (4.6) in the multiple-dose cohort at 2 hours, SST 30 mcg was considered 
effective in managing pain since the majority of patients in this cohort did not request a second dose of 
SST 30 mcg, and the majority of patients (78.8%) and nurses (75.0%) noted satisfaction ratings of “good 
or excellent” on the PGA and HPGA, respectively. 
 
All but 2 patients in the study had either no change in cognition or an increase in cognitive skills, as 
indicated by no change or an increase from baseline to 1 hour in SIS scores, with both patients (aged ≤65 
years) having only a 1-point drop from baseline. In early studies, IV morphine has been shown to impair 
recall and reaction time [32,33], and in more recent studies, patients with acute dosing of opioids had 
an increased risk of developing delirium [34,35], shown to be especially prevalent in the elderly 
population [36,37]. In the current study, no patient aged ≥65 years had a decrease in cognitive skills. 
Further, concern of possible cognitive effects in older and elderly patients have been associated with 
poorer quality pain care, with patients being prescribed lower doses of opioid analgesics or longer 
delays in treatment compared with younger patients [38–41]. However, conflicting data from studies of 
elderly post-operative patients following hip fracture has shown that among the opioids morphine,

hydromorphone, fentanyl, oxycodone, and meperidine, only meperidine was associated with cognitive 
dysfunction [42,43]. Ketamine, a N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist gaining widespread use in emergency 
medicine and in battlefield medicine for its rapid-acting analgesic and sedation properties [44], is limited 
by its psychomimetic effects (eg, cognitive dysfunction, hallucinations, nightmares, and excessive 
sedation) at higher (>2 mg/kg) doses [45,46].  
 
Most (79%) patients in this study did not experience an AE, and the types of AEs reported were generally 
as expected in this type of patient population in an ED setting [47,48]. One serious AE (angina pectoris) 
was reported in a patient aged ≥65 years who had a history of coronary artery disease, and 2 patients 
experienced transient room air oxygen desaturations below 95%, which was considered related to SST 
30 mcg. Rates of AEs in this study were generally similar or lower with SST 30 mcg compared with AE 
rates in other recent studies of IV opioids in a similar setting [47–49]. In a prospective study of 150 
patients treated with IV morphine in the ED, 22.6% of patients experienced nausea and 4.4% 
experienced vomiting [49]. In a retrospective analysis of more than 30,000 ED patients treated with 
opioids, the IV route of opioid administration was associated with an 8.5% rate of reported 
nausea/vomiting, as well as a 7.5% rate of oxygen saturation levels falling below 92% [47]. AEs were also 
reported in a randomized clinical trial where 224 patients in an ED were treated with either IV 
hydromorphone or an IV opioid, as determined by the treating physician [48]. Patients treated with IV 
hydromorphone experienced high rates of nausea (17.2%), pruritus (6.5%), and vomiting (4.7%).  
Current reports on the use of IV opioids (ie, morphine and hydromorphone) in the ED indicate that they 
may be inadequate in treating severe acute pain [50]. Analgesic onset—the time it takes the drug to 
reach the central nervous system—occurs more rapidly with sufentanil than with hydromorphone or 
morphine, which is reflected by the t1/2ke0 (6.2 [10], 46 [51], and 168 [9] minutes, respectively) between 
plasma and the central nervous system. Slow onset of analgesia can lead to early drug redosing which 
may ultimately cause a CNS overdose due to “dose stacking”, with potential risk for incurring AEs [52–
56]. AEs, including respiratory depression, may also be exacerbated by active metabolites, present 
following treatment with morphine (ie, morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide) and 
hydromorphone (ie, hydromorphone-3-glucuronide and hydromorphone-6-glucuronide), but not 
sufentanil [12], particularly in patients with renal impairment [52,53,57–59].

Sufentanil sublingual tablet 30 mcg in the ED 
 
At least 1 study (N = 119) has reported that the standard dose of 0.1 mg/ kg of IV morphine is not 
effective in treating acute severe pain in an ED setting [60], and, in a similar study, that higher doses of 
IV morphine (0.15 mg/kg) did not provide clinically superior pain relief compared with 0.1 mg/kg of IV 
morphine [61]. Further, patient pain may be prolonged due to time constraints associated with the 
setup of an IV line [1,5], which is estimated to take an additional 2 or more hours when advanced IV 
placement techniques are required (overall mean time from triage to IV setup:  64–81 minutes 
[traditional IV] vs 199 minutes [advanced placement]) [3]. In contrast, the current study demonstrates 
the feasibility of using SST 30 mcg in an ED setting and provides evidence that SST 30 mcg is effective in 
managing acute pain, and therefore may be considered a reasonable alternative to IV morphine. The 
unique characteristics of SST 30 mcg (including rapid onset and no IV required) may be advantageous in 
an ED population, in which patients are, by nature, not prescreened (ie, without benefit of a complete 
physical examination and laboratory workup afforded a pre- and post-operative patient) and are 
matriculating through a rapid-paced environment. 
 
5. 
LIMITATIONS 
By virtue of the inherent difficulty in recruiting ED patients with trauma into an experimental analgesic 
study, this was a relatively small (N=76) single-arm study; as such, the lack of a comparator group limits 
our interpretation of effectiveness results. Also, only a single dose of SST 30 mcg was used or required 
for much of this study, which may further limit the ability to interpret effectiveness and safety data in 
trauma patients who may otherwise require multiple dosing; however, the safety profile of SST 30 mcg 
in this study was similar to the safety profile of sublingual sufentanil 15 mcg in 1 active (vs IV patient-
controlled analgesia with morphine sulfate) and 2 placebo-controlled phase 3 studies in post-surgical 
patient populations [13–15]. Further, in a phase 2, dose-finding, placebo-controlled study of sublingual 
sufentanil for the management of pain following bunionectomy, SST 30 mcg was well tolerated; all but 1 
AE were considered mild-to-moderate in severity [16]. Finally, pain intensity data were not collected 
earlier than 15 minutes post-dosing (per protocol), limiting the ability to gauge effectiveness earlier than 
this timepoint. 
 
6. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Sufentanil sublingual tablet (30 mcg) was demonstrated to be a potentially feasible option for managing 
moderate-to-severe acute pain in the ED. Additional research is needed to assess the safety, efficacy, 
and ease of use relative to other pain treatments in the ED.
