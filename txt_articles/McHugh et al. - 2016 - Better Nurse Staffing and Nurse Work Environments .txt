Abstract
Background—Although nurses are the most likely first responders to witness an in-hospital 
cardiac arrest (IHCA) and provide treatment, little research has been undertaken to determine what 
features of nursing are related to cardiac arrest outcomes.
Objectives—To determine the association between nurse staffing, nurse work environments, and 
IHCA survival.
Research Design—Cross-sectional study of data from: (1) the American Heart Association’s 
Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation database; (2) the University of Pennsylvania Multi-State 
Nursing Care and and Patient Safety; and (3) the American Hospital Association annual survey. 
Logistic regression models were used to determine the association of the features of nursing and 
IHCA survival to discharge after adjusting for hospital and patient characteristics.
Subjects—A total of 11,160 adult patients aged 18 and older between 2005 and 2007 in 75 
hospitals in 4 states (Pennsylvania, Florida, California, and New Jersey).

 Results—Each additional patient per nurse on medical-surgical units was associated with a 5% 
lower likelihood of surviving IHCA to discharge (odds ratio = 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 
0.91–0.99). Further, patients cared for in hospitals with poor work environments had a 16% lower 
likelihood of IHCA survival (odds ratio = 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–0.99) than patients 
cared for in hospitals with better work environments.
Conclusions—Better work environments and decreased patient-to-nurse ratios on medical-
surgical units are associated with higher odds of patient survival after an IHCA. These results add 
to a large body of literature suggesting that outcomes are better when nurses have a more 
reasonable workload and work in good hospital work environments. Improving nurse working 
conditions holds promise for improving survival following IHCA.
Keywords
nursing; in-hospital cardiac arrest; cardiopulmonary resuscitation
Despite the resources and opportunity to intervene early when a cardiac arrest occurs in the 
hospital, fewer than a quarter of patients survive to discharge.1 Some hospitals, however, 
have been much more successful than others at improving survival following an in-hospital 
cardiac arrest (IHCA).2–6 One study showed that the odds on survival differed by as much as 
42% for similar patients treated in different hospitals with similar characteristics.2 There is 
little evidence, however, to help explain why patients cared for in one hospital can fare so 
much better than a similar patient in another hospital, and importantly, what could be done 
to improve things
One possible explanation for the range in outcomes is variation in the identification of IHCA 
and initiation of an appropriate and timely response—the first link in the “chain of 
survival.”4,7–9 Nurses are the primary surveillance system in the highly complex hospital 
environment.10 Close patient observation and evaluation are defining characteristics of 
professional nursing.10 Nurses are at the bedside 24 hours a day, everyday; they are 
responsible for early warning system monitoring, they have direct knowledge of patient 
condition and changes in condition, and they are often the first on the scene of a cardiac 
arrest, initiate treatment, and coordinate the activities of others to save a patient’s life. Thus, 
nurses are ideally positioned to identify IHCA and mobilize lifesaving interventions.11–13
Research over the past decade has shown that sufficient nurse staffing levels and favorable 
work environments facilitate nurses’ effectiveness as a surveillance system. Staffing is 
important to surveillance because sufficient numbers of nurses are necessary to manage 
complex patient care needs, identify when something has gone wrong, and intervene rapidly 
to save patients’ lives. Nurses in good work environments have greater autonomy, control 
over their practice and resources, and excellent working relationships and communication 
with physicians, all of which can empower nurses’ ability and agency to act on behalf of 
patients. One example of this is the research on failure to rescue (FTR)—a measure created 
to assess a hospital’s ability to rescue patients who have developed serious complications. 
Measures of FTR have been endorsed by the National Quality Forum as nursing sensitive14 
and by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality as a patient safety indicator.15 A

 significant body of evidence has shown that patients cared for in hospitals with better nurse 
staffing16–19 and better nurse work environments18–20 have lower odds of FTR.
Very few studies have examined any aspect of hospital nursing and the relationship with 
outcomes of cardiac arrest. Nurse staffing is the only nursing variable that has been studied. 
However, these studies have limitations. Chen et al21 found that nurse staffing was the only 
modifiable hospital factor associated with both decreased cardiac arrest incidence and 
improved survival to discharge. Although Chen and colleagues used the same patient data 
that we use, they were limited by having a measure of nurse staffing based on American 
Hospital Association (AHA) data, which have well-documented limitations,22 including the 
inability to distinguish bedside nurses from other registered nurses who do not provide direct 
patient care. Needleman et al16 found that better staffing was associated with lower rates of 
cardiac arrest using a better staffing measure but only had administrative patient data. 
Although standard administrative patient data files can be used to identify cardiac 
arrhythmias and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, they do not allow for patient risk adjustment 
based on detailed characteristics of the cardiac arrest event, such as the initial cardiac rhythm 
and whether the event was witnessed or not. No paper had a measure of the nurse work 
environment and thus, no studies have evaluated the relationship between nursing and IHCA 
outcomes using detailed measures of nurse staffing and nurse work environment linked with 
detailed patient registry data as we do in this study.
The aim of this study was to assess the relationship of nurse staffing and nursing work 
environment with survival following IHCA. We hypothesized that patients cared for in 
hospitals with lower patient to nurse ratios and better nursing environments would have 
better odds of survival to discharge following IHCA.
METHODS
This cross-sectional study linked data from 3 sources: (1) the American Heart Association’s 
Get With The Guidelines In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest-Resuscitation database (GWTG-R) 
(from which data on the characteristics and outcomes for patients who suffered IHCAs were 
obtained); (2) the University of Pennsylvania Multi-State Nursing Care and Patient Safety 
Survey (from which data on hospital nursing were obtained)23; and (3) the AHA’s annual 
survey of hospitals (from which hospital characteristics were obtained). Hospitals included 
in this study participated in the GWTG-R clinical registry between the years 2005 and 2007, 
responded to the 2006 AHA survey, and were in the 4 states studied in the nurse survey—
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, California, and Florida. These states represent over 20% of 
hospital admissions nationally, and hospitals in these states are reasonably representative of 
hospitals nationally.23
Get With the Guidelines Resuscitation
Data for IHCA came from GWTG-R which is a large, prospective, national quality-
improvement registry of IHCA sponsored by the American Heart Association. Trained 
quality-improvement hospital personnel enroll all patients with a cardiac arrest treated with 
resuscitation. Cases are identified by a centralized collection of cardiac arrest flow sheets, 
hospital paging system log reviews, routine code cart checks, pharmacy drug records, and

 hospital billing for resuscitation medications. The registry uses standardized Utstein-
style24,25 definitions for all patient variables and outcomes to facilitate uniform reporting 
across hospitals. Data accuracy is ensured by rigorous certification of data abstractors and 
use of standardized software with data checks for accuracy and completeness with an error 
rate of 2.4%.26 Outcome Sciences Inc. serves as the data collection and coordination center 
for GWTG-R. The University of Pennsylvania serves as the data analytic center and has an 
agreement to prepare the data for research purposes. Further detail can be found in previous 
descriptions.27
The patient population for the study was limited to patients on inpatient units at the time of 
IHCA who had initial documented rhythms of pulseless electrical activity, asystole, 
ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. Exclusion criteria included: (1) patients 
under the age of 18 (resuscitation guidelines differ for children); (2) unit type [obstetrics, 
pediatrics, psychiatry, rehabilitation, emergency departments, and procedural areas are 
excluded because our focus is on intensive care unit (ICU) and general medical-surgical 
areas]; and (3) patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (a cardiac arrest primary 
prevention measure). The final analytic sample consisted of 11,160 adult patients in 75 
hospitals that had information from all 3 data sources on patient characteristics, resuscitation 
outcomes, nursing resources, and hospital characteristics (Fig. 1). Analyses were restricted 
to hospitals with ≥ 10 cardiac arrests events in 2005–2007.
Multistate Nursing Survey
Nurse survey data were collected previously for another study in Pennsylvania, California, 
and New Jersey between September 2005 and August 2006 and in Florida between 
November 2007 and April 2008. More than 100,000 nurses responded to the survey, which 
was mailed to a large random sample in all 4 states. Their responses were aggregated by 
employing hospital, providing detailed information on 650 acute care hospitals, or almost all 
hospitals of over 100 beds in the 4 states; 601 hospitals had the required data on variables of 
interest from the nurse and AHA surveys. A full description of the survey method is 
described elsewhere.23
Measures
Each nurse surveyed reported the number of patients and the number of nurses on their last 
shift. We then created our aggregate measures of medical-surgical and adult ICU staffing for 
each hospital by dividing the average number of patients reported by nurses on their unit on 
their last shift by the average number of nurses on the unit for that same shift. We have 
found our direct survey measure of staffing to be superior to other data sources in predicting 
patient outcomes, possibly because it includes only bedside nurses.23,28
The 31-item Practice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index (PES-NWI)29 was used 
to measure the nurse work environment. The PES-NWI has been widely used in previous 
research,18,30,31 has established reliability and validity, and is an endorsed measure by the 
National Quality Forum.14 The scale indicates the degree (1 = strongly disagree to 4 = 
strongly agree) to which numerous organizational features are present in the current practice 
setting. Hospital-level measures were created by aggregating nurses’ responses to items

 comprising 4 of the 5 subscales: nurse participation in hospital affairs, nursing foundations 
for quality care, nurse manager ability, leadership, and support of nurses, nurse-physician 
relations. The Cronbach α for the subscales ranged from 0.71 to 0.84. The staffing/resource 
adequacy subscale was omitted because it was correlated with, and conceptually similar to, 
the direct measure of staffing. We then used these subscales to classify hospitals as having 
“poor,” “mixed,” and “good” work environments based on the number of work environment 
subscales that were above the median for all hospitals, where 0–1 subscales above the 
median represents a poor work environment, 2–3 above the median represents a mixed 
environment, and all 4 above the median represents a good work environment. Thus, 
hospitals in the “poor” category are those with work environments that are below the median 
on nearly every dimension, hospitals in the “good” category are those with work 
environments that are above the median for all hospitals on every dimension, and hospitals 
in the “mixed” category are the remainder, or those which are above the median on 2 or 3 
dimensions.
We used additional control variables pertaining to hospital characteristics in our models 
adapted from the 2006 AHA hospital survey, which have been shown in previous research to 
be associated with patient outcomes.2,28,32 Hospital size was measured by number of beds to 
differentiate between hospitals with <250 beds, 251–500 beds, and >500 beds. Teaching 
status was categorized into nonteaching (no residents or fellows), minor teaching (≤ 1:4 
residents/fellow to bed ratio), and major teaching (> 1:4). High-technology hospitals were 
identified by whether they had facilities for open-heart surgery, major organ transplants, or 
both. For-profit hospitals were distinguished from nonprofit hospitals. We created an 
indicator for hospitals in the top decile for the Medicaid percentage of inpatient days. We 
used an indicator for hospital state and whether the hospital was in an urban versus rural 
area. We also included a variable indicating whether the hospital was part of a multihospital 
system.
Our key outcome was a binary variable indicating whether a patient did or did not survive 
IHCA to hospital discharge. Our risk-adjustment approach was based on the model 
developed and validated by Chan et al33 that includes controls for age, select conditions 
present before IHCA (malignancy, septicemia, hepatic insufficiency, and hypotension), pre-
IHCA critical care interventions (vasopressors, assisted/mechanical ventilation, and cardiac 
monitoring), and initial IHCA rhythm, all of which are strongly associated with IHCA 
survival.33 We also included variables indicating whether the arrest occurred in an ICU and 
for whether the arrest was monitored or witnessed.
Data Analysis
Hospital-level measures of nursing were derived from the nurse survey data and merged with 
categorical hospital characteristic data derived from the AHA annual survey and patient-
level data from GWTG-R patient data, using common hospital identifiers. All data were 
deidentified before being returned to the investigators for analysis. The resulting analytic file 
included individual patient and event characteristics, as well as the nursing and 
organizational characteristics of the hospitals from which they were discharged. We first 
provide a description of the hospitals in the GWTG-R sample used in our analyses (n = 75).

 We also compared the characteristics of those hospitals with the hospitals that were 
represented in the nurse survey data but not in GWTG-R (n = 526). We then compared 
characteristics of the patients who survived to discharge with those who died before 
discharge using χ2 tests to determine the significance of the differences between them. 
Finally, logistic regression models that accounted for the clustering of patients within 
hospitals34 were used to estimate the size and significance of the associations between nurse 
staffing, nurse work environment, and patient survival following IHCA. Estimated odds 
ratios (ORs) from adjusted models show the effects of medical-surgical and ICU staffing, 
and poor work environment on the likelihood of surviving to discharge. Models were fit 
sequentially; the first model was a bivariate test of the effects of ICU staffing, medical-
surgical staffing, and poor work environments on survival separately, without controlling for 
patient and hospital characteristics. The second model estimated the effects of nursing 
factors simultaneously, while also adjusting for hospital and patient characteristics.
RESULTS
Table 1 provides comparison information on the characteristics of the 75 GWTG-R hospitals 
and the other hospitals in the multistate sample (n = 526) to determine whether and how 
GWTG-R hospitals differed from hospitals in general. GWTG-R hospitals were significantly 
larger and more likely to be high-technology hospitals. GWTG-R hospitals were not 
significantly different from other hospitals with respect to teaching status, state, urban/rural 
location, system membership, for-profit status, or high Medicaid, nor with respect to nurse 
staffing levels and nurse work environments, which were the factors of greatest concern. 
Staffing in hospital medical-surgical units varied considerably (mean medical-surgical 
staffing = 7 patients per nurse, SD = 2.8). Staffing was less variable across hospital ICU 
settings (mean = 2.3, SD = 0.6).
Table 2 shows characteristics of the 11,160 IHCA patients in the 75 study hospitals. The 
mean patient age was 68 ± 15.6 years, 56% were male, and 17% were black. Overall, 15% 
of IHCA patients survived to discharge. Over half of IHCA occurred in the ICU, over 80% 
were witnessed, and 88% were monitored. Hypotension was the most common condition 
present before cardiac arrest. A shockable rhythm was initially present for 15% of patients. 
The likelihood of surviving to discharge was significantly related to all of the characteristics 
listed in the table.
Table 3 shows the results of fitting bivariate models, which estimate the effects of the 
different nursing factors and the other hospital and patient characteristics (one at a time) on 
the likelihood of surviving to discharge, and a multivariate model which estimates all effects 
simultaneously. In the multivariate models for which results are displayed in the table, some 
of the hospital characteristics were dropped when their effects were insignificant or did not 
significantly alter the effects of the nursing characteristics (Supplementary Digital Content 
2, http://links.lww.com/MLR/B77 shows similar results for the full model). In both the 
bivariate and multivariate models, the effects of the different patient and event characteristics
—the characteristics we thought might be potential confounds to estimating the effects of 
the nursing characteristics—are sizable and, in most cases, significant. Notably, patients 
with shockable rhythms were over 3 times as likely as patients without shockable rhythms to

 survive, even when other factors were taken into account, and patients who were being 
monitored were nearly twice as likely to survive. Patients who were mechanically ventilated 
were only half as likely to survive, and the odds on survival were also significantly 
diminished for patients with the other characteristics we considered, including septicemia, 
hepatic insufficiency, hypotension, and malignancies. What is most noteworthy for present 
purposes, however, is that in the final model, in which we estimate the effects of the nursing 
factors after taking account of these potential confounds, as well as other hospital 
characteristics, the effects of 2 of the 3 nursing characteristics remained sizable and 
significant. Although ICU staffing had no discernable effect on survival, either before or 
after adjustment, each additional patient per nurse on medical-surgical units was associated 
with a 5% (OR = 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–0.99) lower odds of survival to 
discharge in the adjusted model. Furthermore, there was a decreased likelihood of survival, 
by 16%, in hospitals with poor work environments (OR = 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 
0.71–0.95). We also evaluated models (Supplementary Digital Content 2, http://
links.lww.com/MLR/B77) focusing on ICU and medical-surgical patients separately. The 
results were qualitatively similar.
DISCUSSION
The study reported here is the first to describe the relationship between nursing factors and 
patient outcomes following in-hospital resuscitation, after taking into account other 
explanations, including patient severity of illness and clinical interventions. Our findings 
have implications for workforce interventions to improve patient outcomes.
Better work environments and lower patient to nurse ratios on medical-surgical units were 
associated with increased odds of survival after IHCA, even after taking into account other 
likely explanations. The likelihood of survival was 16% lower for patients cared for in 
hospitals with poor nursing work environments. In addition, the odds of survival were 5% 
lower for each additional patient per nurse on medical-surgical units. In contrast, there was 
no association between nurse staffing in ICUs and survival, most likely due to the national 
standardization of ICU nurse staffing at 2 patients per nurse, whereas nurse staffing in 
medical-surgical units varies substantially across hospitals. Thus, the interpretation is not 
that nurse staffing is any less important in the ICU than on medical-surgical units, but that 
detecting the impact of very small variations in ICU staffing in large, multihospital studies is 
difficult.
Prior research points to the importance of early detection of IHCA and rapid treatment. In 
our study, non-witnessed and nonmonitored arrests, in which response time to treatment is 
greater, occurred most frequently on medical-surgical units where there is most variability in 
nurse staffing. Considering our findings that survival is much better when patients are 
monitored, better targeted and increased use of cardiac monitoring would be a worthwhile 
consideration. Only 12% of patients, however, were not monitored. An advantage of 
focusing on nursing is that the benefits not only accrue to those at risk for IHCA as we show 
in this study, but, as the large body of literature has now shown, many populations at risk for 
multiple poor outcomes benefit (eg, mortality, FTR, and readmissions for general surgery 
patients, mortality and readmissions for medical patients, adverse events, infant outcomes).

 Ultimately, more monitors still require sufficient numbers of nurses to watch, interpret, and 
respond to them. In addition, poor work environments, which we found to be significantly 
associated with lower likelihood of survival independent of staffing levels, may have their 
effect because they are associated with in-efficiencies and interruptions that undermine 
nurses’ surveillance and mobilization of rapid treatment. Poor nurse and physician 
relationships for example, a component of our measure of work environments, may also add 
to delays in comprehensive treatment.35,36
Our results add to a growing body of research literature suggesting that improving hospital 
work environments may hold promise for reducing preventable deaths, and specifically for 
improving survival following IHCA. Our findings also supply additional evidence that 
adequate hospital nurse staffing may be an important strategy in efforts aimed at achieving 
excellent patient outcomes. Improving nurse staffing, however, may be difficult for some 
hospitals because of costs; nurse staffing accounts for over 40% of direct inpatient care 
costs.37 Improvement of work environments, in contrast, requires a change of 
interprofessional culture and extended delegation of care management to those care 
providers who are closest to patients. We have found in prior research that the relationship 
between staffing and outcomes can depend on having a good work environment.23 This 
suggests that adding more nurses without considering the work environment may be a poor 
investment. One potential pathway for dealing with the obstacles of culture change and 
achieving improved nurse work environments is the American Nurses Credentialing 
Center’s Magnet Recognition Program.38 Research suggests that Magnet programs tend 
have better work environments as measured empirically using the PES-NWI as in this 
paper.39
This study should be interpreted in the context of the following limitations. Foremost, 
because this study used a cross-sectional design, we cannot establish causality. Establishing 
causality would require, at a minimum, an alternative design with different data, and 
repeated measures over time. In addition, although GWTG-R allowed us to adjust for key 
variables that have been linked to survival, there may be other confounding variables not 
accounted for that might otherwise have influenced our findings. Participation in GWTG-R 
is voluntary, and as we have shown, hospitals that participate are larger and more likely to be 
high-technology hospitals compared with the full population of hospitals. Thus, care should 
be taken in generalizing our research findings from the GWTG-R hospitals to others, 
although there is evidence to suggest that nurse staffing and better work environments are 
associated with improved patient outcomes in representative groups of hospitals.23,40 
Likewise, we expect that the GWTG-R hospitals have less variation than the general hospital 
population in terms of both staffing and work environment, which likely leads us to 
understate the relationship between these nursing factors and outcomes.
Adequate nurse staffing and good nurse work environments are associated with survival 
following an IHCA and are important to consider as factors to be modified in efforts to 
improve the survival of patients who experience a cardiac arrest in the hospital. Nearly half 
of IHCAs occur on medical-surgical units, which also have the most variable staffing levels 
and the most problematic work environments. Higher patient-to-nurse ratios on these units 
are associated with lower odds of survival after IHCAs. This study adds to the evidence that

 investment in nursing resources, particularly nurse staffing and work environments in 
medical-surgical units, should be considered as potentially important factors in efforts to 
improve patient survival following IHCA.

ICU staffing and medical-surgical staffing are measured by the ratios of patients to nurses; the work environment measure contrasts hospitals with 
poor environments with hospitals with mixed or good environments; the referent categories for beds, teaching status, technology status, and urban 
are <200 beds, nonteaching, nonhigh technology, and rural, respectively. Our models include dummy variables for state leaving one state as the 
reference category; age is coded in years; arrest location is coded as occurring on an ICU unit (1) versus medical-surgical unit (0); all other patient 
characteristics are coded as present (1) versus absent (0).
