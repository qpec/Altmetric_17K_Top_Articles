approach

Abstract
Despite timely intervention, there exists a small subgroup of patients with septic shock who develop progressive
multi-organ failure. Seemingly refractory to conventional therapy, they exhibit a very high mortality. Such patients
are often poorly represented in large clinical trials. Consequently, good evidence for effective treatment strategies is
lacking. In this article, we describe a pragmatic, multi-faceted approach to managing patients with refractory septic
shock based on our experience of toxin-mediated sepsis in a specialist referral centre. Many components of this
strategy are inexpensive and widely accessible, and so may offer an opportunity to improve outcomes in these
critically ill patients.

Introduction
The Surviving Sepsis Guidelines provide a suitable
framework to guide therapy for the majority of patients
with septic shock [1]. Appropriate and timely antimicro-
bial therapy, source control if indicated, fluid therapy,
and targeted vasopressors remain the backbone of treat-
ment. However, a small proportion of patients fail to re-
spond to these measures and deteriorate precipitously
into refractory shock and progressive multi-organ fail-
ure. This subgroup of patients is often poorly repre-
sented in large randomised controlled trials investigating
the efficacy of interventions in septic shock. As a result,
there is little conclusive evidence to guide management
in this particular population.
Refractory septic shock is variably defined as the pres-
ence of hypotension, with end-organ dysfunction, requir-
ing high-dose vasopressor support often greater than
0.5 μg/kg/min norepinephrine or equivalent [2]. Regard-
less of the precise definition, there is an associated mortal-
ity of up to 60%. Furthermore, patients with vasopressor
requirements greater than 1 μg/kg/min norepinephrine or
equivalent who continue to deteriorate clinically have a re-
ported mortality as high as 80–90% [3, 4]. Microcircula-
tory failure and associated ischaemic consequences are
frequently observed and alternative therapeutic strategies
are desperately needed to improve outcomes in this small
subgroup of critically ill patients.
In this viewpoint article we describe a pragmatic,
multi-faceted approach to managing patients with refrac-
tory septic shock. The list of interventions described
below is drawn from our clinical experience managing pa-
tients with confirmed, or suspected, toxin-producing bac-
teria in a specialist Severe Respiratory Failure centre in
the UK. It is recognised that some of these interventions
lack a robust evidence base. Our intention is not to re-
hearse the current evidence for each component of ther-
apy, but merely to describe our institutional approach
with brief reference to selected relevant literature.
Albumin
Early fluid requirements in these patients often signifi-
cantly exceeds the standard recommended initial regi-
men of 30 ml/kg. Our practice is to use balanced
crystalloids for initial volume replacement, guided by dy-
namic cardiac output monitoring and echocardiography,
followed by 20% human albumin solution if ongoing
fluid resuscitation is required. During the early phase of
severe shock we target a serum albumin level of > 30 g/l.
Albumin maintains plasma oncotic pressure and acts as
an antioxidant and as a buffer for acid-base equilibrium.

 albumin is lacking, a subgroup analysis of 1121 patients
with septic shock in the ALBIOS trial demonstrated a
reduced mortality [5]. Other studies have also suggested
a beneficial effect. However, debate continues over the
role of albumin in septic shock with concerns mainly re-
lated to cost-effectiveness [6]. Our approach is informed
by physiological rationale, a suggestion of benefit in clin-
ical studies, and limited evidence for harm associated
with albumin administration.
Hydrocortisone
The use of corticosteroids in septic shock has been fre-
quently studied. It has been argued that steroid treat-
ment reduces the duration of shock and length of
intensive care unit (ICU) stay [7]. Large randomised
controlled trials have failed to identify a clear survival
benefit [8]. However, the beneficial effects may only be
seen in those patients with the highest illness severity
scores [9]. Our practice is to administer a hydrocorti-
sone infusion (8 mg/h following a 50-mg bolus) to all
patients with refractory septic shock on the basis that
these patients are most likely to benefit and there is little
evidence of harm. This is supported by results from the
recently published APPROCHS study [10] where a sur-
vival benefit was seen in a population of septic shock pa-
tients with high mortality (43.0% vs 49.1% in controls).
This compares to no difference in outcome in the AD-
RENAL study where the observed mortality was much
lower (27.9% vs 28.8% in controls) [11].
Femoral arterial access
Radial arterial pressure waveforms often underestimate
blood pressure in the context of severe hypovolaemia
and peripheral vasoconstriction. This can lead to the ad-
ministration of significantly higher doses of vasopressor
to achieve the ‘target mean arterial blood pressure
(MAP)’. In early septic shock, the difference between
radial and femoral invasive MAP measurements is re-
ported to be around +5 mmHg; however, this discrep-
ancy is increased in advanced shock [12]. We routinely
use femoral arterial access for invasive blood pressure
monitoring in this population. The subsequent increase
in measured MAP frequently allows a significant reduc-
tion in vasopressor dosing in a considerable proportion
of patients [13].
Lower the MAP target
Although retrospective analyses of haemodynamic vari-
ables are available [14], the traditional MAP target of
65 mmHg has not been subjected to scrutiny by many
randomised controlled trials. In a recently published
pooled analysis, lower blood pressure targets were not
associated with adverse outcomes even in patients with
pre-existing
hypertension
[15].
Individually
selected
goals are likely to be more appropriate than rigid pre-
scriptive targets. Arguably, preservation of renal function
is less vital as patients with refractory septic shock are
often already receiving renal replacement therapy. Fur-
thermore, splanchnic perfusion has been shown to be
adequate with a MAP target above 50 mmHg if hypovol-
aemia is avoided in selected patient groups [16]. Young,
previously well patients are particularly tolerant of lower
systemic blood pressure. We therefore reduce the MAP
target in patients with refractory septic shock to 50–
55 mmHg. Our experience is that, in selected patients
without intracranial pathology, this lower MAP target al-
lows a worthwhile reduction in vasopressor require-
ments leading to improved tissue perfusion and an
associated reduction of hyperlactataemia. Norepineph-
rine remains our vasopressor of choice and we avoid the
use of vasopressin which, in our experience, appears to
be associated with an increased risk of peripheral and
mesenteric ischaemia in patients with refractory septic
shock. Early enteral nutrition is also avoided in these pa-
tients with refractory septic shock on high-dose vaso-
pressors; we prefer the use of parenteral nutrition until
the shock state has resolved.
Minimise sedation
Sedative medications exacerbate hypotension through
myocardial depression and systemic vasodilation. Micro-
circulatory flow may also be impaired. Current guide-
lines
suggest
minimising
sedation
in
mechanically
ventilated patients with sepsis [1]. However, our experi-
ence is that this approach is not always adhered to. Pa-
tients with refractory septic shock often have a reduced
level of consciousness as a result of septic encephalop-
athy, and consequently sedation requirements may be
even lower than the general ICU sepsis population. Fur-
thermore, altered hepatic metabolism and reduced renal
clearance may lead to accumulation of sedative agents in
shocked patients [17]. Sedative strategies and agents are
numerous. Perfusion may be improved using low-dose
midazolam instead of propofol [18]. However, delirium,
accumulation, and duration of action can limit the use-
fulness of long-term benzodiazepine infusion. We min-
imise sedation in patients with refractory septic shock.
Where sedation is required, our first-line strategy is to
use a predominantly opiate-based regimen in conjunc-
tion with low-dose propofol titrated to a specified target
sedation score.
Replacement of thiamine and vitamin C
Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is an essential water-soluble
substance that cannot be synthesised by the body. It has
powerful antioxidant properties and functions as an im-
portant enzyme co-factor in the biosynthesis of en-
dogenous catecholamines and vasopressin [19]. It also

remain extremely low in critically ill patients despite
regular supplementation. This is exacerbated in patients
with septic shock where vitamin C deficiency is common

or

ported a significant reduction in vasopressor require-
ments with intravenous replacement of vitamin C [22].
Further trials are ongoing, but intravenous replacement
of vitamin C in septic shock is based on scientific ration-
ale and appears to be a safe and useful intervention [23].
Vitamin B1 (thiamine) is a water-soluble vitamin with
an essential role in carbohydrate metabolism and energy
production. Absolute or relative thiamine deficiency is
common in patients with septic shock [24]. Such a defi-
ciency may present as an unexplained lactic acidosis but
remains undetected since routine red cell transketolase
measurements are rarely available and often very costly.
Intravenous thiamine replacement has been shown to re-
duce lactate levels and mortality in patients with proven
thiamine
deficiency
[25].
Furthermore,
intravenous
thiamine replacement may also be associated with a re-
duced need for renal replacement therapy and improved
renal function in patients with septic shock [26].
Our practice is to give combined vitamin C (4.5 g/day)
and thiamine (2.25 g/day) using three pairs of intraven-
ous Pabrinex™ three times per day until shock has re-
solved. This dosing regimen has been used in our
institution, hospital-wide, for several years to prevent
Wernicke’s encephalopathy in alcoholics. Combination
therapy may be more effective with the suggestion of a
synergistic effect between the two agents [27]. A recent
retrospective cohort study demonstrated a dramatic re-
duction in organ failures, duration of vasopressor sup-
port, and mortality using combination treatment with
intravenous hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine
[28]. The presence of thiamine may mitigate concerns
over renal oxalate crystal precipitation secondary to
high-dose vitamin C and, whilst more robust evidence is
awaited, there appears to be little harm with this
approach.
Adjunctive antimicrobial therapy
In addition to broad spectrum antibiotics, we routinely ad-
minister clindamycin to patients with refractory septic
shock until initial microbiological analyses have excluded
toxin-producing pathogens or until stabilisation of organ
dysfunction is achieved. Clindamycin inhibits bacterial pro-
tein synthesis and prevents generation of super-antigens. It
is an inexpensive and accessible intervention with a proven
efficacy in toxic shock syndrome [29]. Although recom-
mended by several guidelines, clindamycin is often consid-
ered late into a patient’s presentation despite maximal
benefit being associated with early administration.
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
Treatment with IVIG in patients with septic shock has
been proposed for several decades. There is extensive bio-
logical plausibility as to the beneficial immunological ef-
fects of IVIG in patients with toxin-mediated septic shock
[30]. However, the literature remains conflicting, with sev-
eral meta-analyses failing to demonstrate improved out-
comes. Although current guidelines recommend against
the routine use of IVIG in septic shock, it is acknowledged
that further trials are needed. Early administration is likely
to offer the optimal prospect of benefit. We empirically ini-
tiate treatment with IVIG to progressively deteriorating pa-
tients with refractory septic shock secondary to suspected
toxin-producing organisms such as group A streptococcus
(1 g/kg on day 1, then 0.5 g/kg on days 2 and 3) or
Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) Staphylococcus aureus
(2 g/kg on day 1, repeated on day 3 if no improvement).
Levosimendan
Septic cardiomyopathy resulting in a low cardiac output
state is relatively common in patients with refractory
septic shock. Central venous saturations (ScvO2) may be
difficult to interpret in this context due to significant im-
pairment of oxygen utilisation. Screening echocardiog-
raphy identifies those patients with moderate to severely
impaired myocardial function and may exclude primary
cardiogenic causes. Dobutamine has traditionally been
used in this context, but exacerbation of existing tachy-
cardia and increased myocardial oxygen consumption
limit its usefulness. Alternatively, improved cardiac func-
tion can be achieved using levosimendan in conjunction
with the maintenance of ionised calcium levels greater
than 1.2 mmol/l. Although the LeoPARDS trial found no
benefit with levosimendan in patients with sepsis [31], it
is difficult to extrapolate these findings to a subgroup
with refractory shock. Only 10% of the patients studied
demonstrated evidence of a low cardiac output state and
mortality was much lower than would be expected in
this subgroup. Our practice is to administer levosimen-
dan to patients with echocardiographic features of mod-
erate
to

function and impaired end-organ perfusion. Concerns
over the potential need for increased vasopressor re-
quirements can be mitigated by many of the points pre-
viously described in this article.
Epoprostenol and heparin
Intravenous prostacyclin has beneficial effects on micro-
circulatory flow. It has been shown to increase oxygen

 delivery in critically ill patients [32] and successfully re-
verse symmetrical peripheral limb ischaemia secondary
to high-dose vasopressors in septic shock [33]. Its wider
use is frequently limited by concerns over exacerbating
hypotension; other vasodilators such as nitrates are used
by other centres, but in our experience do not appear to
be as effective. In patients with refractory septic shock
with peripheral mottling we commence a low-dose epo-
prostenol infusion (0.5–5 ng/kg/min) to improve micro-
circulatory
flow
and
prevent
the
occurrence
of
peripheral thrombotic events. Our experience is that
peripheral ischaemic complications are reduced and
haemodynamic compromise is rarely encountered if the
prostacyclin infusion is titrated up very slowly. In the
setting of disseminated intravascular coagulation and
suspicion of end-organ microthrombosis, and in the
absence of absolute contra-indications, we also initiate
low-dose
intravenous
heparin
infusion
(fixed
rate
250–500 IU/h).
Renal replacement therapy
Although the IVOIRE study did not identify a survival
benefit with high-volume haemofiltration compared with
standard dosing [34], in refractory septic shock our prac-
tice is to initiate early haemodiafiltration with doses of
40–60 ml/kg/h. This facilitates rapid temperature con-
trol and correction of metabolic acidosis which, in our
experience, contributes to a reduction in vasopressor re-
quirements and improved cardiac output. Whilst there
are concerns about removal of antibiotics, water-soluble
vitamins, and trace elements, a recent review concluded
that high-volume haemofiltration is not associated with
adverse effects [35]. Appropriate compensatory anti-
biotic dosing and vitamin/trace element supplementa-
tion
must
be
taken
into
account.
Correction
of
metabolic acidosis may be achieved with sodium bicar-
bonate [36] but this risks further fluid administration
and sodium overload, both of which can be avoided with
renal replacement therapy.
Extracorporeal support
Finally, in highly selected patients with refractory septic
shock (often in the context of severe respiratory failure),
extracorporeal technology providing respiratory and/or
cardiac support achieves stability and buys time for the
therapeutic interventions described above to have an im-
pact. The benefits of extracorporeal support include im-
proved global oxygen delivery, reduced intrathoracic
pressures from reduced mechanical ventilatory require-
ments, improved carbon dioxide clearance and acid-base
management, and improved myocardial performance. A
recent publication has reported positive clinical out-
comes using this approach [37].
Conclusion
The management of refractory septic shock remains ex-
tremely challenging. We believe that where established
conventional interventions fail to deliver improvements,
a different approach using pragmatic strategies is neces-
sary. Many of the interventions described here have
proven biological plausibility but lack conclusive evi-
dence. However, many remain unstudied in the context
of refractory septic shock. Most of these strategies are
relatively inexpensive, widely accessible, and are likely to
be available in the majority of institutions. Our collective
belief is that a bespoke approach can help to achieve
haemodynamic stability and reverse progressive deterior-
ation in this small subgroup of critically ill patients with
a very high mortality.
