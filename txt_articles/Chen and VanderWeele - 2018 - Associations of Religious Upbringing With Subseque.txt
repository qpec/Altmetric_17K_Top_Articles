In the present study, we prospectively examined the associations of religious involvement in adolescence (includ-
ing religious service attendance and prayer or meditation) with a wide array of psychological well-being, mental
health, health behavior, physical health, and character strength outcomes in young adulthood. Longitudinal data
from the Growing Up Today Study were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Sample sizes ranged
from 5,681 to 7,458, depending on outcome; the mean baseline age was 14.74 years, and there were 8–14 years of
follow-up (1999 to either 2007, 2010, or 2013). Bonferroni correction was used to correct for multiple testing. All
models were controlled for sociodemographic characteristics, maternal health, and prior values of the outcome vari-
ables whenever data were available. Compared with no attendance, at least weekly attendance of religious services
was associated with greater life satisfaction and positive affect, a number of character strengths, lower probabilities
of marijuana use and early sexual initiation, and fewer lifetime sexual partners. Analyses of prayer or meditation
yielded similar results. Although decisions about religion are not shaped principally by health, encouraging service
attendance and private practices in adolescents who already hold religious beliefs may be meaningful avenues of
development and support, possibly leading to better health and well-being.

America is highly religious (1, 2). Religious beliefs and prac-
tices are likely shaped by a number of factors, the most promi-
nent of which may be religious upbringing in early life (3, 4). It
is a common practice for parents to raise their children based on
their own religious beliefs (5). There has, however, been a con-
tinuing decline in religiosity for decades, for the most part due
to lower rates in younger generations (6, 7). Despite the general
trends of declining religious participation, there is still consider-
able intergenerational religious continuity in the United States
(4). For instance, recent estimates of the rates of intergenera-
tional transmission of religious affiliation were 82% in Jews,
85% in Muslims, 62% in Evangelical Protestants, and 43% in
Catholics, and 59% of parents who attended religious ser-
vices at least weekly had children who reported frequent ser-
vice attendance (4).
Empirical research suggests that religion is associated with
better health and well-being in adults (8). For instance, there
is a gradient relationship between frequent religious service
attendance and lower mortality risk, even in the most rigorous
studies (9–14). In other studies, religious involvement has also
been linked to a wide range of other outcomes, such as greater
psychological well-being, character strengths, reduced mental
illness, and healthier behaviors (8, 15, 16). Religious teachings
often concern practices related to living a healthy lifestyle and
also sometimes explicitly consider character or respect for the
body as an integral part of the beliefs (15).
Individuals engage in religion in a variety of ways, such as
public participation, religious affiliation and identity, private
practices, and religious coping (15). There have only been a
limited number of studies in which investigators have com-
pared the health associations of multiple forms of religious
participation within the same study. Results from studies in
adults generally suggest that religious attendance shows the
strongest health associations in community samples, whereas

 religious coping is a prominent predictor for recovery and sur-
vival in clinically ill populations (13, 15, 17).
To date, prior studies have mostly been conducted in adults.
However, research has increasingly suggested that religion may
confer lifecourse influences and that religion may have even
more profound health effects at younger ages (18, 19). Existing
evidence in adolescents suggests that religious involvement may
protect against certain behaviors and promote positive practices
(20–23). These studies are, however, subject to certain limita-
tions. Specifically, much of the prior work is cross-sectional.
There is often limited control for baseline characteristics, and
reverse causation often cannot be ruled out. For example, an
observed inverse association between service attendance and
depression may be confounded by prior depression status,
because depression may affect subsequent service attendance
(24). In addition, different aspects of religious involvement
are often examined in separate studies and a limited number
of outcomes are investigated, so that existing evidence re-
mains scattered across studies. It may be important to exam-
ine multiple health and well-being outcomes simultaneously
within the same study (25, 26).
To provide additionalinsightsinto the role of religious upbring-
ing, we used an outcome-wide analytic approach (26) to prospec-
tively examine the associations of religious involvement in
adolescence with a wide array of psychological, mental, behav-
ioral, physical health, and character strengths outcomes in
young adulthood. The 2 aspects of religious participation that
were examined were frequency of religious service atten-
dance (a form of public participation) and frequency of
prayer or meditation (a form of private practice). The inde-
pendent associations of service attendance and prayer or
meditation across outcomes were also examined in a second-
ary analysis. We hypothesized that both frequent service
attendance and prayer or meditation are each associated with
greater psychological, mental, behavioral, and physical health
and character strengths outcomes. Drawing upon prior literature
in adults (13, 15, 17), we expected that service attendance would
have stronger associations with various outcomes than would
prayer or meditation.
METHODS
We used longitudinal data from the Nurses’ Health Study II
(NHSII) and the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS). NHSII was
initiated in 1989, and it enrolled 116,430 nurses aged 25–42
years. In 1996, NHSII participants with children between 9 and
14 years of age were invited to have their children participate in
another cohort of GUTS. A total of 16,882 children completed
the questionnaires about their health. NHSII and GUTS partici-
pants continue to be followed up with mailed or Web-based
questionnaires annually or biennially (27, 28). This study was
approved by the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Institutional
Review Boards.
Religious participation was first assessed in the GUTS 1999
questionnaire wave; therefore, this year was considered as base-
line for the present study. The outcome variables were assessed in
the most recent waves, either the 2010 wave (for participants aged
23–30 years) or the 2013 or 2007 wave (if data were not available
in the 2010 wave). Of respondents to the 1999 questionnaire
(n = 12,410), those with missing data on the exposure (n = 1,597
on religious service attendance and n = 1,621 on prayer or medi-
tation) or the outcome variable (n ranged from 3,355 to 5,124 for
analyses on service attendance and from 3,341 to 5,108 for analy-
ses on prayer or meditation, depending on the outcome) were
removed from each analysis involving those variables. Missing
data on the covariates were imputed from the previous ques-
tionnaire year; if no such data were available, the mean values
(for continuous variables) or values of the largest category
(for categorical variables) of the nonmissing data were used
for imputation. This yielded samples of 5,689–7,458 indivi-
duals (up to 1,329 were siblings) for analyses on service atten-
dance and 5,681–7,448 individuals (up to 1,325 were siblings)
for analyses on prayer or meditation, depending on the out-
come. Compared with participants who were lost to follow-up
in the 2010 questionnaire wave, those who remained in the
cohort were older and healthier, had a higher socioeconomic
status, and were more likely to report frequent religious partici-
pation at baseline; in addition, a higher percentage was female
(Web Table 1, available at https://academic.oup.com/aje).
Web Table 2 shows the timing of the assessment of all vari-
ables. The exposure variables (service attendance and prayer
or meditation) were assessed in the GUTS 1999 questionnaire
wave (participants aged 12–19 years). To reduce the possibil-
ity of reverse causation, prior values of the outcome variables
assessed in wave 1998 or 1999 were used as a covariate when-
ever available.
Exposure assessment
Religious service attendance.
Frequency of religious service
attendance (1999 wave) was measured using the question, “How
often do you go to religious meetings or services?” Response op-
tions ranged from 1 (never) to 5 (more than once per week). Re-
sponses were grouped into 3 categories: never, less than once per
week, and at least once per week (29).
Prayer or meditation.
Frequency of prayer or meditation
(1999 wave) was assessed with the question, “How often do you
pray or meditate?” Response categories ranged from 1 (never) to
4 (once per day or more).
Outcome assessment
A wide array of psychological well-being (life satisfaction,
positive affect, self-esteem, emotional processing, and emotional
expression), character strengths (frequency of volunteering, sense
of mission, forgiveness of others, and being registered to vote),
physical health (number of physical health problems and
overweight/obesity), mental health (depression, anxiety, and
probable posttraumatic stress disorder), and health behavioral
(cigarette smoking, frequent binge drinking, marijuana use,
other illicit drug use, prescription drug misuse, number of life-
time sexual partners, early sexual initiation, history of sexually
transmitted Infections (STIs), teen pregnancy, abnormal Pap
test results) outcomes were assessed (waves 2010, 2013, or
2007). See Web Table 3 and the Web Appendix for details on
each measurement.

 Covariates assessment
Sociodemographic characteristics.
Sociodemographic co-
variates included participant age (in years), sex (female or male),
race (white or nonwhite), and geographic region (West, Mid-
west, South, or Northeast) (GUTS 1999). Maternal covariates
included maternal age (in years; NHSII 1999), race (white or
nonwhite; NHSII 1999), marital status (NHSII 1997), subjec-
tive socioeconomic status in the United States and in the com-
munity (both rated on a scale from 1 to 10), and pretax household
income (<$50,000, $50,000–$74,999, $75,000–$99,999, or
≥$100,000; NHSII 2001). We also considered census-tract col-
lege education rate (used as a continuous variable) and median
income (<$50,000, $50,000–$74,999, $75,000–$99,999, or
≥$100,000; NHSII 2001).
Maternal depression.
The 5-item Mental Health Index (30)
was used to measure maternal depressive symptoms over the
past 4 weeks (NHSII 1997). As in prior work, a score less than
53 was considered to be an indicator of probable depression (31).
Maternal smoking.
The mothers also reported their current
smoking status (NHSII 1997). The response categories were
yes and no.
Prior values of the outcome variables.
To reduce the possi-
bility of reverse causation, we adjusted for prior values of the
outcome variables whenever data were available. Specifically,
adjustments were made for prior depressive symptoms, weight
status, smoking, drinking, marijuana use, other drug use, prescrip-
tion drug misuse, number of lifetime sexual partners, history of
early sexual initiation, history of STIs, and history of pregnancy
(GUTS 1998 or 1999).
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS, version
9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) (P values were
calculated based on 2-sided tests). Distributions of participant
characteristics in the full analytic samples were first exam-
ined. Next, χ2 test and analysis of variance test were used to
examine the associations of service attendance and prayer or
meditation with covariates separately.
In primary analyses, multiple generalized estimating equa-
tions were first used to regress each health and well-being
outcome on religious service attendance in separate models,
with adjustment for clustering by sibling status. Continuous
outcomes were standardized (mean = 0, standard deviation, 1)
to facilitate comparison of effect estimates across outcomes.
Bonferroni correction was used to correct for multiple testing.
For all analyses, we adjusted for sociodemographic character-
istics, maternal health, and prior values of the outcome vari-
ables whenever available. Next, we reanalyzed the primary sets
of models with prayer or meditation as the exposure. Lastly, we
included service attendance and prayer or meditation simulta-
neously in the models to examine their independent associa-
tions across outcomes.
Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robust-
ness of the observed associations to unmeasured confounding
(32, 33). Specifically, we calculated E-values (33), which indi-
cate the minimum strength of association that an unmeasured
confounder would need to have with both the exposure and
the outcome on the risk ratio scale to fully account for an
observed exposure-outcome association, above and beyond
the measured covariates.
RESULTS
Descriptive analyses
In the full analytic sample, participants were predominantly
white, a higher percentage was female, and most had a high
family socioeconomic status (Web Tables 4 and 5). The mean
baseline age was 14.74 (standard deviation, 1.66) years. Nearly
60% of the participants attended religious services at least
weekly, and 36% reported prayer or meditation at least once
per day. Participant characteristics by frequency of service atten-
dance are shown in Table 1, and characteristics by frequency of
prayer or meditation are shown in Web Table 6.
Religious service attendance, health, and well-being
Compared with never attendance, at least weekly service
attendance was subsequently associated with greater life sat-
isfaction and positive affect, greater volunteering, greater
sense of mission, more forgiveness, and lower probabilities
of drug use and early sexual initiation (Table 2). It was also
possibly associated with fewer depressive symptoms and lower
probabilities of probable posttraumatic stress disorder, cigarette
smoking, prescription drug misuse, history of STIs, and abnormal
Pap test results, although the associations did not reach P < 0.05
after correction for multiple testing. In comparison, there was little
difference between less than weekly and never attendance of ser-
vices except for in the character outcomes.
When service attendance and prayer or meditation were simul-
taneously included in the model, the associations of service atten-
dance with outcomes were mostly attenuated (Web Table 7),
which may be due to the correlation between service attendance
and prayer or meditation (r = 0.60). Nevertheless, the associa-
tions of service attendance with volunteering, forgiveness, mari-
juana use, early sexual initiation, and the number of lifetime
sexual partners remained at the level P < 0.05 even after correc-
tion for multiple testing.
Prayer or meditation, health, and well-being
Compared with never praying or meditating, at least daily
practice was associated with greater positive affect, emotional
processing, and emotional expression; greater volunteering,
greater sense of mission, and more forgiveness; lower likeli-
hoods of drug use, early sexual initiation, STIs, and abnormal
Pap test results; and fewer lifetime sexual partners (Table 3).
It was also possibly associated with greater life satisfaction and
self-esteem, greater likelihood of being registered to vote, fewer
depressive symptoms, and a lower risk of cigarette smoking,
although the associations did not reach a level of P < 0.05 after
correction for multiple testing. Somewhat unexpectedly, com-
pared with never praying or meditating, at least daily practice
was possibly associated with more, rather than fewer, physical
health problems. A comparison of less than daily praying or
meditating with never showed little difference, with only a few
exceptions. For example, prayer or meditation was positively
associated with volunteering, sense of mission, and forgiveness

a The full analytic sample was restricted to those who had valid data on religious service attendance. The actual sample size for each analysis

ous questionnaire years; if no such data were available, missing data were imputed as the mean values (continuous variables) or values of the larg-
est category (categorical variables) of the nonmissing data. All models were controlled for participants’ age, race, sex, geographic region, and prior
health status or prior health behaviors (prior depressive symptoms, overweight/obesity, smoking, drinking, marijuana use, other drug use, prescrip-
tion drug misuse, number of sexual partners, early sexual initiation, history of sexually transmitted infections, history of teen pregnancy), as well as

 processing, emotional expression, volunteering, sense of mission,
forgiveness, drug use, number of sexual partners, and history of
STIs still held (Web Table 7); associations were attenuated,
though some remained, when instead controlling for young adult,
rather than adolescent, service attendance (Web Table 8).
Sensitivity analyses for unmeasured confounding
To assess the robustness of the observed associations to
unmeasured confounding, we calculated E-values (33) for the
associations of religious service attendance (at least weekly
vs. never) and prayer or meditation (at least daily vs. never)
with various outcomes (Table 4). In the present study, there is
evidence suggesting that some of the observed associations
were likely robust to unmeasured confounding. This is espe-
cially true with the character outcomes, drug use, and sexual
behaviors. For example, as noted in Table 4, an unmeasured
confounder would need to be associated with both service
attendance and volunteering by risk ratios of 1.90 each to fully
explain away the observed association of at least weekly (vs.
never) attendance of services with volunteering and by 1.72-fold
each to shift the lower confidence limit for the estimate to include
the null value, above and beyond the measured covariates.
DISCUSSION
There is growing interest in promoting protective factors
that lead to better health, beyond the traditional approach that
focuses on reducing risk factors for diseases (34). Once risk
factors are established, it can be difficult to restore a healthy
state. It may be more effective to promote and maintain health
and well-being starting in early life (35). Results from the pres-
ent study suggest that religious involvement in adolescence may

 be one such protective factor for a range of health and well-
being outcomes (20).
Consistent with prior literature, our results suggest associa-
tions of frequent religious participation in adolescence with
greater subsequent psychological well-being, character strengths,
and lower risks of mental illness and several health behaviors
(36–38). For instance, congruent with prior meta-analyses of
mostly cross-sectional adolescent studies on religion and health
behaviors (37, 38), we found reduced probabilities of drug use
and several sexual behaviors among religiously observant ado-
lescents. Also, consistent with results from a prior meta-analysis
of religion and forgiveness (39), we found a positive association
of religious involvement with forgiveness in early life. Likewise,
the effect size between religious involvement and depressive
symptoms in the present study is similar to that from a meta-
analysis (β = −0.09, 95% confidence interval: −0.11, −0.08) in
which investigators integrated evidence across ages (40). In our
study, there was little association between religious involvement
and anxiety, which is in fact consistent with results from other
prior longitudinal studies of adult populations (15) and contrasts
with results from cross-sectional studies (16). Our study adds to
prior literature by providing evidence from longitudinal data with
confounding control and also control for baseline values of the
outcome variables.
Contrary to our expectation, our results suggest that frequent
prayer or meditation may be associated with more physical
health problems. To our knowledge, the association between
religion and adolescent physical health has not been well-
studied; we are not aware of any prior longitudinal work in
this area using community samples of adolescents (41). There
is, however, evidence from clinical populations that individuals
with chronic conditions are more likely to use private religious
practices to cope with illness (41, 42). Because of the lack of
available data, we did not control for baseline physical health.
The inverse association between prayer or meditation and
physical health in the present study may in part be due to
reverse causation. Those who already have physical health pro-
blems may be more likely to pray. It is also conceivable that
those with religious beliefs may sometimes avoid medical care
because of these beliefs or potentially thinking that the prayer
will suffice for healing.
Service attendance is generally the strongest religious/spiritual
predictor of health in nonclinical adult samples (8, 13, 17, 36). In
contrast, we found that compared with service attendance, prayer

were for life satisfaction, positive affect, probable posttraumatic

In adolescent populations, service attendance may be a marker of
parental service attendance patterns that may not persist into later
life, whereas private religious practices may more closely corre-
spond to their own service attendance patterns later in life (43).

a See VanderWeele and Ding (33) for the formula for calculating E-values.
b The E-values for effect estimates are the minimum strength of association on the risk ratio scale that an unmea-
sured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome to fully explain away the observed as-
sociations of religious service attendance (at least weekly vs. never) and prayer or meditation (at least daily vs. never)
with various health outcomes as shown in the last column of Tables 2 and 3, conditional on the measured covariates.
For example, an unmeasured confounder would need to be associated with both religious service attendance and for-
giveness of others by risk ratios of 3.15 each, above and beyond the measured covariates, to fully explain away the
observed association between at least weekly religious service attendance and forgiveness of others.
c The E-values for the limit of the 95% CI closest to the null denote the minimum strength of association on the risk
ratio scale that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome to shift the
confidence interval to include the null value, conditional on the measured covariates. For example, an unmeasured
confounder would need to be associated with both religious service attendance and forgiveness of others by 2.88-fold
each, above and beyond the measured covariates, to shift the lower limit of the CI for the observed association
between at least weekly service attendance and forgiveness of others to include the null value.

 service attendance only partially attenuated the associations, per-
haps suggesting some independent effect.
Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to heightened inter-
est in pursuing thrill-seeking behaviors (18). The behavioralnorms
and patterns formed in this period may, in fact, exert profound in-
fluences over the lifecourse (18). For example, the initiation of
smoking is more likely to occur in adolescence than in other
stage of life, if it happens at all. Adolescents who have initiated
smoking are also likely to continue smoking into adulthood (44).
Therefore, if a resilience factor can protect adolescents from initi-
ating smoking, it may reduce their lifetime health risk substan-
tially (18). The present study adds to prior evidence suggesting
that religious involvement in adolescence may serve as one such
protective factor in not only reducing smoking but also in main-
taining psychological well-being, developing character strengths,
and reducing certain behaviors, as well as possibly also reducing
depression. The beneficial effects of religious involvement in
adolescence may function through a number of mechanisms.
For instance, religion provides directives or personal virtue to
help maintain self-control and develop negative attitudes toward
certain behaviors (45). Some religious groups promote beliefs that
create meaning and practices that foster active coping, such as
practicing forgiveness and meditation, which could help youth
actively cope with stress (45). Moreover, peer religious youth
groups may be an important source of social support and adult
role modeling, and they may be an avenue to direct peer influ-
ences on behavioral choices. Religious congregations could also
connect adolescents to networks and resources in the broader
community (41, 45).
The present study advances beyond prior literature in a number
of ways. First, we took an outcome-wide analytic approach to
provide a broad picture of the role of religious participation dur-
ing adolescence in relation to a wide range of health and well-
being outcomes within the same sample, which helps synthesize
previously scattered evidence on individual health outcomes in
separate studies. Second, the longitudinal design and the follow-
up periods of 8–14 years help establish temporal ordering for as-
sessing causality. Third, the longitudinal data along with the
adjustment for baseline values of the outcome variables help
reduce the possibility of reverse causation, which has been identi-
fied as a major threat to assessing causal effects of religious prac-
tice (8). The present study also used sensitivity analyses to assess
the robustness of the associations to unmeasured confounding,
which provides further evidence for assessing causality.
Our study is, however, subject to certain limitations. First,
religious involvement was measured with 2 single items that
were widely used in adults. These measures did not consider
developmental characteristics of adolescents. For instance,
adolescents’ decisions on religious participation are likely shaped
by both parents and peers. It may, therefore, be important to
assess influences from both (e.g., pressure by parents to attend
religious services and participation in peer religious youth groups)
to facilitate understanding in a developmentally relevant frame-
work (46). Second, the results may be subject to residual con-
founding by parental religiousness (e.g., parental church attendance
and parental religious affiliation) for which information was not
available. However, we adjusted for baseline maternal depres-
sion and smoking status, which have both been linked to reli-
gious participation and to child outcomes (16, 47). Results from
the sensitivity analysis also suggest that a number of the observed
associations are relatively robust to potential unmeasured con-
founding. As a further limitation, GUTS participants were mostly
white, and their mothers all worked in the nursing field. Therefore,
results of this study may not be generalizable to other populations.
There is evidence that religion is an important social deter-
minant of health over the lifecourse (18). Religious participa-
tion in adulthood is, in many cases, a function of religious
upbringing in early life (18). Intergenerational transmission
of religious values and practices occurs largely through parental
modeling and is likely facilitated by close parent-child relation-
ships (48). Although decisions about religion are not shaped
principally by health, for adolescents who already hold reli-
gious beliefs, encouraging service attendance and private prac-
tices may be meaningful avenues of development and support,
possibly leading to better health and well-being.
