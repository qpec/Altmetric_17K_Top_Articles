Endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) are small molecules
biosynthesized from membrane glycerophospholipid. Ananda-
mide (AEA) is an endogenous intestinal cannabinoid that controls
appetite and energy balance by engagement of the enteric
nervous system through cannabinoid receptors. Here, we uncover
a role for AEA and its receptor, cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), in the
regulation of immune tolerance in the gut and the pancreas. This
work demonstrates a major immunological role for an endocanna-
binoid. The pungent molecule capsaicin (CP) has a similar effect as
AEA; however, CP acts by engagement of the vanilloid receptor
TRPV1, causing local production of AEA, which acts through CB2.
We show that the engagement of the cannabinoid/vanilloid recep-
tors augments the number and immune suppressive function of
the regulatory CX3CR1hi macrophages (Mϕ), which express the
highest levels of such receptors among the gut immune cells. Ad-
ditionally, TRPV1−/− or CB2−/− mice have fewer CX3CR1hi Mϕ in
the gut. Treatment of mice with CP also leads to differentiation of
a regulatory subset of CD4+ cells, the Tr1 cells, in an IL-27–depen-
dent manner in vitro and in vivo. In a functional demonstration,
tolerance elicited by engagement of TRPV1 can be transferred to
naïve nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice [model of type 1 diabetes
(T1D)] by transfer of CD4+ T cells. Further, oral administration of
AEA to NOD mice provides protection from T1D. Our study unveils
a role for the endocannabinoid system in maintaining immune
homeostasis in the gut/pancreas and reveals a conversation be-
tween the nervous and immune systems using distinct receptors.

T
he endocannabinoid system (ECS) is highly conserved in evo-
lution dating back to at least 600 million years (1). It consists of
(i) lipid endocannabinoids; (ii) their receptors such as the G
protein-coupled receptors, cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), canna-
binoid receptor 2 (CB2), and a ligand-gated cation channel vanilloid
receptor 1 (i.e., TRPV1); and (iii) the enzymes such as fatty acid
amide hydrolyase (FAAH) that regulate the levels of endocanna-
binoids in vivo (2). The ECS impacts several aspects of mammalian
physiology, particularly in the gut. Endogenous cannabinoids such
as anandamide (AEA) belong to the N-acylethanolamine family
and are synthesized from membrane glycerophospholipids (3, 4).
AEA is an intestinal endocannabinoid, which engages its cognate
receptors on the enteric nervous system and contributes to con-
trol of appetite and energy balance (5). Here, we have unraveled
a role of the ECS in regulating immune homeostasis in the gut–
pancreas axis.
The intestinal immune system is continuously exposed to a va-
riety of antigens. An effective immune response must be launched
against pathogenic insults; however, it must maintain tolerance to
the vast amount of antigens such as those in commensal flora,
endogenous metabolites, and food components. Mononuclear
phagocytes (MNPs) such as CX3CR1hi macrophage (Mϕ) and
CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs), which are present abundantly in the
small intestinal lamina propria (siLP), play an instrumental role in
maintaining this exquisite balance between inflammation and
tolerance (6).
On the basis of expression level of the chemokine receptor
CX3CR1, two functionally and phenotypically distinct populations
of MNPs in the gut have been identified. Although both pop-
ulations differentiate from blood derived monocytes, CX3CR1hi
Mϕ are regulatory in nature, whereas CX3CR1lo cells are per-
petuators of inflammation (7). Adoptive transfer of CX3CR1hi
Mϕ provide protection from inflammatory diseases like colitis in
mouse models (8). However, the microenvironment signal that
“educates” the monocytes and promotes differentiation into
CX3CR1hi (as opposed to CX3CR1lo) Mϕ still remains elusive.
It is increasingly appreciated that the MNPs play a crucial role in
gut equilibrium. Identifying key elements that condition the siLP
MNPs to become tolerogenic will enable exploration of strategies
that can be helpful in providing protection from inflammatory
diseases.
The studies described here connect the nervous system (re-
sponsible for sensing exogenous cannabinoids such as marijuana,
as well as endogenous ones) to one of the most fundamental
properties of the immune system, i.e., maintenance of an immune
tolerant environment in the gut. These studies have a bearing on
marijuana use and abuse, particularly with respect to the formu-
lations meant for ingestion, and very significantly, for new avenues
of understanding and treating human diseases.
Significance
Exogenous cannabinoids such as marijuana exert their influ-
ence through cannabinoid receptors. Endogenous cannabi-
noids such as anandamide (AEA) function through the same
receptors, and their physiological roles are a subject of intense
study. Here, we show that AEA plays a pivotal role in main-
taining immunological health in the gut. The immune system in
the gut actively tolerates the foreign antigens present in the
gut through mechanisms that are only partially understood.
We show that AEA contributes to this critical process by pro-
moting the presence of CX3CR1hi macrophages, which are im-
munosuppressive. These results uncover a major conversation
between the immune and nervous systems. In addition, with
the increasing prevalence of ingestion of exogenous mari-
juana, our study has significant implications for public health.

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
 Results
CX3CR1hi Mϕ Express the Highest Levels of ECS Receptors CB2 and
TRPV1. siLP cells were isolated after removing the Peyer’s patches
(PPs), and cell suspensions obtained were analyzed. Fig. S1A
depicts the gating strategy to identify the different cell pop-
ulations. The SSChi cells were gated for CD11b+SiglecF+ cells
(i.e., eosinophils) and the SSClo cells for lymphocytes (B220+ and
CD3+) and the MNPs. Phenotypic characterization of the MNPs
was based on the expression of integrins CD11b (αM), CD11c
(αX), CD103 (αE), and the chemokine receptor CX3CR1.
Special attention was paid to the CX3CR1 phenotype because
CX3CR1hi Mϕ but not the CX3CR1lo cells play a significant role
in immune homeostasis (7). To facilitate the identification of
CX3CR1hi and CX3CR1lo cells, we used the CX3CR1+/gfp reporter
mice in which GFP expression is a marker for CX3CR1 ex-
pression (9). As a quality-control measure, cell suspensions de-
rived from siLP of these mice were stained with antibody against
CX3CR1 and also checked for GFP by flow cytometry. The two
patterns were consistent (Fig. S1B). We classified the MNPs as R1
(CD11b+CD11c+) and R2 (CD11b−CD11c+). R1 was further sub-
classified into CD11b+CD11c+CX3CR1hi, CD11b+CD11c+CX3CR1lo,
and CD11b+CD11c+CD103+, and, in the R2, we looked for
CD11b−CD11chiCD103+ (Fig. S1A, Bottom). Selected pop-
ulations were analyzed for the expression level of TRPV1 (Fig.
S1C) and CB2 (Fig. S1D). Of note, the MNPs expressed higher
levels of TRPV1 and CB2 compared with the lymphocytes and
eosinophils. Strikingly, CX3CR1hi cells expressed higher levels of
TRPV1 and CB2 compared with the other cells analyzed (Fig.
1A). This finding was corroborated by quantitative PCR (qPCR)
analysis of mRNA levels of TRPV1 and Cnr2 (gene encoding
CB2) on the various gut immune populations (Fig. S1E). Be-
cause of the substantial overlap in surface phenotype of in-
testinal DCs and Mϕ, designation of CX3CR1hi cells as DCs or
Mϕ is debatable. However, Tamoutounour et al. have shown that
expression of CD64 (the high-affinity FcγR1) and absence of
CD103 can be used in combination with CD11c and MHCII to
definitively define functionally distinct Mϕ in intestine of mice
(10). The population predominantly expressing TRPV1 and
CB2 was found to meet these criteria (Fig. 1B, Top). Consistent
with Tamoutounour et al., we show that CX3CR1lo cells are a
heterogeneous population comprising of Mϕ (CD64+) and DCs
(CD64−; Fig. S2A). Previous reports demonstrate that CX3CR1hi
Mϕ make IL-10 ex vivo without stimulation (7). The IL-10–
producing capacity of the CX3CR1hi Mϕ was tested ex vivo with-
out any stimulation by using the IL-10–GFP reporter mice (11); it
was observed that CX3CR1hi Mϕ express high levels of IL-10 (Fig.
1B, Bottom). Thus, TRPV1 and CB2, which are integral compo-
nents of the ECS, are preferentially expressed by the CX3CR1hi
regulatory Mϕ.
ECS Receptors Regulate CX3CR1hi Mϕ Homeostasis in the Gut. Given
the high expression of TRPV1 and CB2 on CX3CR1hi Mϕ, we
analyzed the role of each receptor. For TRPV1, we back-crossed
TRPV1−/− mice (12) with CX3CR1gfp/gfp reporter mice to obtain
CX3CR1gfp/+ TRPV1−/− mice. We validated the expression of
functional (i.e., WT) allele and GFP allele for CX3CR1 and the
absence of TRPV1 by PCR (Fig. S2B). Introduction of GFP
disrupts the expression of endogenous CX3CR1 such that a
homozygous mice does not express functional CX3CR1 protein
whereas heterozygous mice do, and the expression of CX3CR1
in them can be followed through GFP. By analyzing the siLP cells
of the CX3CR1gfp/+TRPV1−/− mice, we observed that the absence
of TRPV1 influences the frequency and number of CX3CR1+
cells differently: the frequency and number of CX3CR1hi Mϕ are
reduced significantly (Fig. 1C, Middle), whereas, in case of the
CX3CR1lo cells, there is a trend of decreasing number and fre-
quency but the difference is not statistically significant (Fig. 1C,
Bottom). These results in CX3CR1gfp/+TRPV1−/− mice were also
reproduced in TRPV1−/− mice in which CX3CR1 was identified
with antibody staining (Fig. S2C). The frequency and number of
the other cells such as CD103+ DCs and CD3+ and B220+ cells
remain unaffected in the absence of TRPV1 (Fig. S2 D and E).
Next, we tested the importance of CB2 on the homeostasis of
CX3CR1hi Mϕ by using mice genetically lacking CB2: the fre-
quency and absolute number of CX3CR1hi Mϕ was significantly
reduced in CB2-deficient mice (Fig. 1D, Middle). As in TRPV1−/−
mice, there is a trend of decreasing number and frequency
among the CX3CR1lo cells in CB2−/− mice as well, but the dif-
ference is not statistically significant (Fig. 1D, Bottom).

regulatory CX3CR1hi Mϕ but not the frequency and number of
the CX3CR1lo cells (Fig. 2A). CP did not affect the frequency of

 CD11c+CD103+ DCs (Fig. S3A). To test if CP-mediated in-
crease in CX3CR1hi Mϕ frequency was caused by enhanced
proliferation, an in vivo BrdU incorporation assay was per-
formed in mice that had undergone oral gavage with CP: feeding
of CP did not result in incorporation of BrdU in CX3CR1hi Mϕ
(Fig. S3B). We performed RNA sequencing and IsoEM/IsoDE
analysis (13, 14) (as described in SI Materials and Methods) on
the total MNPs of siLP to study the changes mediated by
treatment with CP; the heat map for hierarchical clustering of
the top 1,200 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shows a
clear presence of genes that are significantly up- or down-
regulated by CP treatment (Fig. S3C). We used Database for
Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID)
Bioinformatic Resource, version 6.8, to study the functional-
related gene groups and pathways. We found that CP treat-
ment significantly enhances the cytokine/chemokine-mediated
signaling pathways such as CCL2, CXCL12, CSF1, and IL-10
(Table S1). Thus, the increase in the frequency of CX3CR1hi
Mϕ must derive from augmented migration or differentiation or
a combination of both processes.
To distinguish between the contribution of TRPV1-expressing
neurons vs. immune cells to the phenomenon shown in Fig. 2A,
TRPV1−/− mice reconstituted with bone marrow (BM) from
TRPV1+/+ mice were treated with CP. The siLP CX3CR1hi Mϕ
populations in all groups were monitored: CP-fed BM chimeric
(BMC) mice behaved like the WT mice, indicating that TRPV1
expression on the hematopoietic cells was sufficient for activity.
There was a notable, albeit statistically insignificant, difference
between the expansion observed in the WT mice compared with
the BMC mice, suggesting a possible, though not definitive,
contribution from the neuronal TRPV1 in the process (Fig. 2B).
The effect of oral administration of AEA, an endogenous
compound capable of activating vanilloid and cannabinoid re-
ceptors, on CX3CR1hi Mϕ of siLP was examined. Oral adminis-
tration of AEA led to a significant increase in the frequency of
CX3CR1hi Mϕ (Fig. 2C, Bottom Left). As expected, we did not
observe a difference in the frequency of CX3CR1lo cells after
treatment with AEA (Fig. 2C, Bottom Right). We reasoned that, if
administering exogenous AEA can affect the CX3CR1hi Mϕ, in-
creasing the endogenous levels of AEA by inhibiting the enzyme
that catabolizes it should yield similar results. Endogenous levels
of AEA are controlled by the enzyme FAAH, which catabolizes
AEA into arachidonic acid and ethanolamine (Fig. 2D, Top).
Inhibition of FAAH, the enzyme that catabolizes AEA, increases
the levels of AEA in the brain and peripheral tissues (15). Massa
et al. demonstrated that mice genetically deficient in FAAH are
protected from 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis,
highlighting the antiinflammatory role of AEA in the gut (16).
Mice underwent gavage with an orally viable, irreversible
FAAH inhibitor, PF3845, and the effect of this treatment on
CX3CR1hi Mϕ in LP was examined 24 h after feeding. Treat-
ment of mice with PF3845 increased the frequency of the regu-
latory Mϕ demonstrating that endogenous AEA can profoundly
influence the homeostasis of CX3CR1hi Mϕ (Fig. 2D, Bottom).
CP Induces AEA Production in Myeloid Cells. As shown here earlier,
CP and AEA influence CX3CR1hi Mϕ in a similar manner. The
potential of cross-talk between the two was investigated. AEA
biosynthesis involves hydrolysis of a membrane phospholipid
precursor N-arachidonoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) by
a phospholipase C to yield phospho-AEA (pAEA), which is then
dephosphorylated by phosphatases such as the tyrosine phos-
phatase PTPN22; this process in Mϕ is associated with an in-
crease of the level of PTPN22 (17) and a decrease in the level of
phospholipase D NAPE-PLD (17). Consistent with this pattern,
analysis of the transcriptome of siLP MNPs from CP-treated
mice revealed that CP leads to increase in the expression of
PTPN22 with a concomitant decrease in the level of NAPE-PLD
(Fig. 3A, Top Left).
To explore this phenomenon mechanistically in a pure mye-
loid population (as opposed to in vivo, in which the effects could
be indirect), the Mϕ cell line RAW264.7, which expresses
TRPV1 (Fig. S4A), was used. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)
analysis of CP-treated cells shows that treatment with CP acti-
vates the AEA biosynthesis pathway as described earlier (Fig.
3A, Top Right). The changes in the expression levels of
PTPN22 and NAPE-PLD in CP-treated RAW264.7 cells were
validated by a qPCR analysis (Fig. 3A, Middle and Bottom).
AEA Is the Central Molecule in Expansion of CX3CR1hi Mϕ Population.
As shown in Fig. 2 A and C, oral administration of CP or AEA
leads to expansion of the CX3CR1hi population in the siLP. This
phenomenon was now tested in TRPV1−/− and CB2−/− mice. In
TRPV1−/− mice, CP failed to mediate expansion of CX3CR1hi
cells, but AEA still did so (Fig. 3B, Top). As AEA has a higher
binding affinity for CB2 than for TRPV1 (18), the same phe-
nomenon was tested in CB2−/− mice as well. Neither CP nor
AEA mediated expansion of the CX3CR1hi population in the
CB2−/− mice (Fig. 3B, Bottom). These results (Fig. 3 A and B)
indicate that AEA, through its interaction with CB2, is the final
mediator of the expansion of the CX3CR1hi population in siLP
upon oral administration of CP or AEA. The effect of CP is
mediated through two steps: one, generation of AEA upon its
interaction with TRPV1; and two, interaction of AEA with CB2.

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
 Stimulation of ECS by AEA or CP Enhances the Tolerogenic Properties
of MNPs and Provides Protection from Autoimmune Diabetes. IL-10
is a cytokine with potent tolerogenic and antiinflammatory
properties (19, 20). It is particularly important in the gut, as it
has been demonstrated that mice deficient in IL-10 develop
spontaneous enterocolitis (21). We looked at IL-10 production
as a measure of tolerogenicity in the CX3CR1hi Mϕ and CD103+
DCs 24 h after treatment with CP by using the IL-10 GFP-reporter
mice. Compared with vehicle-treated mice, the CX3CR1hi Mϕ of
CP-fed mice showed a significant increase in the production of
IL-10 (Fig. 3C). CP treatment also resulted in a modest but sta-
tistically significant increase in IL-10 production in CD103+ DCs
(Fig. S4B). The capacity of CP to alter the ability of the siLP
MNPs to induce IL-10–producing regulatory T cells was tested.
The CX3CR1hi Mϕ and CD103+ DCs constitute the over-
whelming majority of siLP MNPs; therefore, the total MNPs
(CD11b+CD11c+ and CD11b−CD11c+ cells; Fig. S4C) were sor-
ted from mice treated with vehicle or CP 24 h earlier and cocul-
tured with naïve splenic CD4+ T cells (1:1) for 4 d, and IL-10– and
IFN-γ–producing CD4+ T cells were analyzed. CP-elicited MNPs
led to a significant increase in the expression of IL-10 in the CD4+
T cells (Fig. 3D, Left). Additionally, CP-elicited MNPs led to
significant increase in the induction of a population of CD4+
T cells that express IL-10 and IFN-γ (Fig. 3D, Right). CD4+
T cells, which produce IL-10 and IFN-γ, have been previously
described as a potent regulatory subset called Tr1 cells (22). IL-27,
a member of the IL-12 family, plays a dominant role in the in-
duction of Tr1 cells (23). The requirement of IL-27 for the in-
duction of Tr1 cells by CP-elicited MNPs was tested. Functional
IL-27 receptor has two subunits, IL-27RA (WSX1) and gp130,
gp130 being a common receptor shared with IL-6R family,
whereas IL-27RA is specific to IL-27 signaling (24). The sorted
MNPs were cocultured with naïve CD4+ T cells from IL-27RA+/+
(WT) or IL-27RA−/− mice: the increase in the frequency of CD4+
IL-10+IFN-γ+ T cells seen in the presence of CP-elicited MNPs is
completely abrogated in the T cells derived from the IL-27RA−/−
mice (Fig. 3D, Right). The possibility that CP treatment induces
IL-27 production in the MNPs was tested. IL-27 (p28) levels were
quantified by qPCR: at 2 d after CP treatment, there was a fivefold
increase in the level of IL-27p28 in the MNPs (Fig. 3E). Alto-
gether, these data suggest that (i) CP-elicited MNPs have a su-
perior ability to induce a subset of regulatory T cells called Tr1
cells, (ii) this phenomenon is dependent on IL-27–IL-27R in-
teraction, and (iii) CP treatment makes the milieu in the gut more
amiable for induction of IL-27 in the MNPs. We then tested the
ability of CP to elicit such regulatory T cells in vivo. Two weeks after
CP treatment, the frequency of CD4+IL-10+IFN-γ+ Tr1 cells in siLP
was measured. Consistent with the differentiation of Tr1 cells
in vitro, CP-fed mice showed expansion of Tr1 cells in siLP (Fig. 3F).
We also tested the ability of AEA-elicited MNPs to induce
Tr1 cells in vitro and observed that AEA-elicited MNPs did lead
to a significant increase in the differentiation of Tr1 cells com-
pared with vehicle-elicited MNPs (Fig. 3G). Given that the ECS
promotes several aspects of tolerance-enhancing mechanisms,
we tested the protective effect of AEA in context of type 1 di-
abetes (T1D). We observed (Fig. 3H) that orally gavaged AEA
provided significant protection from T1D in a mouse model, as
seen by us previously in CP-fed mice (25).
Lymph Node Specificity of Increase in the Number of Regulatory Mϕ
by Stimulation of ECS. The pancreatic lymph node (PLN) is the
first site in which initiation and priming of autoreactive T cells
occur in context of T1D (26). Besides draining the pancreas, the
PLN has been shown to drain the gastrointestinal tract (27).
Hence, the PLN is located at the crux of the pancreas and the gut
and can sample the environment of both. Turley et al. showed that
perturbations in the gut can affect the quality of immune response
in the PLN that in turn can alter the course of T1D (27). Based on
this observation that establishes a strong immunological axis be-
tween the gut and the pancreas, we tested the possibility that ECS-
mediated tolerance was evident in the PLN as well.

Acharya et al.
 The effect of oral administration of CP on the PLN Mϕ of
nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice was tested. Engagement of
TRPV1 led to a significant increase in the frequency of CD11b+
CX3CR1+ cells (Fig. 4A). Given that the PLN of NOD mice is
inflamed, we wanted to determine if CP-mediated effect on the
PLN Mϕ is a universal phenomenon and whether it is affected by
the absence of TRPV1. To answer these questions, TRPV1+/+
and TRPV1−/− C57BL/6 mice underwent oral gavage with CP.
Three days after CP administration, there was a significant in-
crease in the frequency of CX3CR1+ Mϕ in the PLN of
TRPV1+/+ mice but not in TRPV1−/− mice (Fig. S5A). These
data demonstrate that the ECS-mediated regulation of the PLN
Mϕ is not restricted to NOD mice and that this phenomenon
requires the presence of functional TRPV1. Although the PLNs
and mesenteric lymph node (MLNs) drain the gut (27), the
CP-elicited increase in the frequency of Mϕ was evident in the
PLN but not in the MLN (Fig. S5B).
The phenotype of the PLN Mϕ was examined and was ob-
served to be akin to that of the siLP Mϕ (Fig. 1B) in terms
of expression of CX3CR1, CD11c, MHCII, and CD64 and
spontaneous production of IL-10 (Fig. 4B). The phenotypic
similarity of the siLP and PLN Mϕ and the kinetics of the
changes (changes in the siLP Mϕ were seen as early as 24 h after
feeding with CP, whereas they were seen only after 3 d in the
PLN) suggest that these Mϕ migrate from the gut to the PLN.
Engagement of ECS Expands a Tolerogenic Subset of CD4+ T Cells in
the PLN in an IL-27–Dependent Manner. Two weeks after CP
treatment, the PLNs were harvested, and the frequency of Tr1
cells in the PLN was measured. Consistent with the CP-mediated
expansion of Tr1 cells in siLP (Fig. 3F), CP-fed mice showed an
expansion of Tr1 cells in the PLN (Fig. 4C). Closer analysis
revealed that CP leads to a significant increase in the frequency
of CD4+IL-10+ but not CD4+IFN-γ+ cells. The mechanism of
Tr1 induction was investigated. Experiments were carried out in
IL-27RA+/+ and IL-27RA−/− mice and, consistent with our study
in vitro, we observed that CP-elicited Tr1 cells depend on the
presence of functional IL-27–IL-27R signaling (Fig. 4D). Sur-
prisingly, when the effects of IL-27 signaling were tested in
CP-fed mice that lacked IL-27RA (i.e., −/−), mice that are hemi-
zygous (i.e., +/−) and mice that are homozygous (i.e., +/+), a clear
gene dose-dependence of Tr1 cell elicitation was observed (Fig.
S5C). Based on these data, it would be important to study the
development of T1D in IL-27RA−/− and IL-27RA+/− mice in an
NOD background. Given that the CX3CR1hi Mϕ are critical to
TRPV1-induced tolerance, we asked if functional CX3CR1 is
required for CP-elicited expansion of Tr1 cells. CX3CR1gfp/gfp
mice underwent oral gavage with CP or vehicle as a control, and
Tr1 cells were analyzed in the PLNs. It was observed that, in the
absence of functional CX3CR1 protein, CP does not elicit
Tr1 cells (Fig. 4E). Of note, we found that oral administration
of CP also leads to a significant decrease in the frequency of
CD4+IL-17A+ T cells in the PLN (Fig. 4F). We note the low fre-
quency of cells in these experiments in Fig. 4, but the clear consis-
tency and very high reproducibility of these modest numbers
persuade us as to their significance. Further testing of these results in
IL-27RA−/−IL-10–GFP and IL-17A–GFP reporter mice in NOD
background is necessary for a more definitive proof of our conclu-
sions in this regard. The physiological consequence of the phenom-
enon seen in experiments described here earlier was partially tested
in NOD mice; CD4+ T cells were isolated from the PLN and spleen
of CP- or vehicle-treated female NOD mice. Naïve female NOD
mice received the CD4+ T cells that were derived from the CP- or
vehicle-treated NOD donors. Disease was monitored by checking the
urine glucose levels twice per week. It was observed that CP-elicited
CD4+ T cells could provide significantly higher protection from T1D
compared with the vehicle-elicited CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4G). However,
we have not tested the possibility that the transfer of IL-10–producing
Mϕ may also recapitulate the phenomenon partly or wholly.
Discussion
The studies reported here show that the endogenous cannabinoid
AEA is a major participant in maintaining tolerance in the gut. It
does so through two nonoverlapping and mutually reenforcing
pathways, i.e., through maintenance/differentiation of the well-
known immune regulatory CX3CR1hi Mϕ population and by me-
diating expansion of the regulatory T cells called Tr1 cells. With
respect to the former, we show that the CX3CR1hi Mϕ express the
highest levels of the cannabinoid receptors CB2 and TRPV1. Ad-
ditionally, oral administration of CP (ligand of TRPV1) or AEA
(ligand of TRPV1 and CB2) led to a significant increase in the
number of functionally active CX3CR1hi Mϕ. Consistent with this
observation, CB2−/− as well as TRPV1−/− mice have a significantly
decreased frequency of the CX3CR1hi Mϕ. In these same mice, the
frequency of CX3CR1lo cells also showed a decreasing trend, al-
though this decrease was not statistically significant.

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
 or receptors suggests two interesting ideas. One, this observation is
important because CX3CR1hi and CX3CR1lo cells are ontogeni-
cally related and arise from Ly6Chi blood-derived monocytes.
Hence, the decrease in the frequency of the CX3CR1+ cells in
the absence of CB2 or TRPV1 suggests that the ECS may be
playing a role in the recruitment of the monocyte precursors.
Second, the observation that the absence of TRPV1 or CB2
powerfully influences the CX3CR1hi Mϕ in particular suggests
that some mechanism other than recruitment governs the ho-
meostasis of these cells. It is conceivable that the ECS may be the
erstwhile esoteric microenvironmental signal that plays a critical
role in the conditioning and maturation of CX3CR1hi Mϕ.
Our results clarify the relationship between the roles of CP, AEA,
TRPV1, and CB2. Both CP and AEA, administered orally, lead to
an expansion of the CX3CR1hi Mϕ population, and protection from
T1D in NOD mice. However, AEA, through its engagement with
CB2, is the actual and final mediator of expansion of CX3CR1hi Mϕ.
CP simply mediates release of endogenous AEA through its in-
teraction with TRPV1, and the AEA in turn acts through CB2.
Engagement of ECS also leads to a significant increase in the
frequency of the regulatory Tr1 cells in the siLP and PLN, al-
though it does not, as reported earlier, increase the number and/
or function of Foxp3+Tregs (25). Induction of Tr1 cells in vivo
occurs through the established IL-27–IL-27R axis (28, 29). In our
study as well, the requirement of IL-27 for TRPV1-mediated
Tr1 expansion is seen in IL-27RA−/− mice. Importantly, CP-
mediated Tr1 expansion in mice that are IL-27RA(−/−), hemi-
zygous (+/−), or homozygous (+/+) demonstrated a gene dose-
dependence of Tr1 cells on IL-27RA. Such dose-dependency of
IL-27 signaling is an observation that suggests that the quantity of
IL-27RA is the limiting factor in physiological conditions. Addi-
tionally, engagement of TRPV1 causes a modest but significant
decrease in the frequency of IL-17A CD4+ T cells in the PLN.
Thus, CP can skew the CD4+ T-cell compartment toward toler-
ance promotion by inhibiting Th17 cells and augmenting the
Tr1 cells. Although modest, the cytokine changes in the CD4+
T-cell compartment were significant and consistent. However, the
use of IL-27RA−/−IL-10–GFP reporter mice and IL-17A–GFP
reporter mice in NOD background would be necessary for a final
confirmation of our conclusion. Functional relevance of this
modulation in the cytokine production is exemplified by the study
that transfer of CP-elicited CD4+ T cells could transfer tolerance
to naïve NOD mice. Further, as IL-27RA−/− mice are not avail-
able in the NOD background, the involvement of IL-27 in ECS-
mediated protection from diabetes has not been directly proven,
even though it is supported by several key observations. Study of
the course of T1D development in IL-27RA−/− mice in an NOD
background is required for a firm delineation of the role of
IL-27 in this autoimmune disease.
Our studies report an example of a neurologically active endo-
cannabinoid playing a substantial immunological role, and suggests
interesting possibilities of concordant regulation of immune tol-
erance and energy balance through one ligand and two receptors.
Materials and Methods
Mice. C57BL/6, NOD/Lt, TRPV1−/−, CB2−/−, IL-27RA−/− (also known as WSX-1−/−),
CX3CR1gfp/gfp, and IL-10–GFP reporter mice were obtained from the
Jackson Laboratory. All animals except NOD/Lt were on a C57BL/6 back-
ground. CX3CR1gfp/gfp were crossed with C57BL/6 mice to obtain CX3CR1gfp/+
mice. CX3CR1gfp/gfp mice were backcrossed with TRPV1−/− to obtain
CX3CR1gfp/+TRPV1−/− mice.
Generation of BMCs. Eight-week-old TRPV1−/− mice received 1,000 rads in a
single dose of γ-irradiation. Two hours later, via retroorbital injection, irra-
diated hosts were adoptively transferred with 1.5 × 106 BM cells harvested
from femurs and tibias of CD45.1+C57BL/6 WT mice. After 7 wk, BM chimeric
mice were bled via tail bleeding to check for BM reconstitution by FACS.
Statistical Analyses. Data were analyzed by Student’s t test (unpaired, one-
tailed) or one-way ANOVA except for the survival curves, which were ana-
lyzed by Mantel–Cox test (GraphPad). P < 0.05 was considered significant.
