Abstract
Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a motor neuron (MN) disease characterized by the loss of MNs
in the central nervous system. As MNs die, patients progressively lose their ability to control voluntary movements,
become paralyzed and eventually die from respiratory/deglutition failure. Despite the selective MN death in ALS,
there is growing evidence that malfunctional astrocytes play a crucial role in disease progression. Thus,
transplantation of healthy astrocytes may compensate for the diseased astrocytes.
Methods: We developed a good manufacturing practice-grade protocol for generation of astrocytes from human
embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The first stage of our protocol is derivation of astrocyte progenitor cells (APCs) from
hESCs. These APCs can be expanded in large quantities and stored frozen as cell banks. Further differentiation of
the APCs yields an enriched population of astrocytes with more than 90% GFAP expression (hES-AS). hES-AS were
injected intrathecally into hSOD1G93A transgenic mice and rats to evaluate their therapeutic potential. The safety
and biodistribution of hES-AS were evaluated in a 9-month study conducted in immunodeficient NSG mice under
good laboratory practice conditions.
Results: In vitro, hES-AS possess the activities of functional healthy astrocytes, including glutamate uptake,
promotion of axon outgrowth and protection of MNs from oxidative stress. A secretome analysis shows that these
hES-AS also secrete several inhibitors of metalloproteases as well as a variety of neuroprotective factors (e.g. TIMP-1,
TIMP-2, OPN, MIF and Midkine). Intrathecal injections of the hES-AS into transgenic hSOD1G93A mice and rats
significantly delayed disease onset and improved motor performance compared to sham-injected animals. A safety
study in immunodeficient mice showed that intrathecal transplantation of hES-AS is safe. Transplanted hES-AS
attached to the meninges along the neuroaxis and survived for the entire duration of the study without formation
of tumors or teratomas. Cell-injected mice gained similar body weight to the sham-injected group and did not
exhibit clinical signs that could be related to the treatment. No differences from the vehicle control were observed
in hematological parameters or blood chemistry.
Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the safety and potential therapeutic benefits of intrathecal injection of
hES-AS for the treatment of ALS.

 Background
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset
disease characterized by the loss of both upper and
lower motor neurons (MNs). Symptoms include pro-
gressive paralysis of MN target muscles. The disease is
incurable, and fatal within 3–5 years of first symptoms,
due to respiratory failure when the diaphragm is affected
[1]. About 10–15% of cases of ALS are familial, and the
other cases are sporadic. Familial ALS includes muta-
tions in Cu2+/Zn2+ superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) [2]
and in RNA/DNA binding proteins FUS and TAR DNA
binding protein-43 [3]. However, the most frequent
genetic cause of ALS (40% of familial ALS) is an amplifi-
cation of a hexanucleotide in a noncoding region of the
C9orf72 gene [4].
The pathological mechanisms for ALS are still not well
understood
and
the
proposed
mechanisms
include
inflammation, oxidative stress, glutamate cytotoxicity
and protein aggregation. Although MNs are the main
affected cells in the disease, a growing body of evidence
suggests the involvement of astrocytes in the pathology
of ALS in a non cell autonomous pathway. The contri-
bution of astrocytes to the pathology of ALS is probably
a combination of loss of homeostatic functions and/or
gain of toxic functions. Several mechanisms by which
ALS patients’ astrocytes affect ALS pathology include
astrocyte toxicity; astrocytes that were isolated from
sporadic and familial postmortem ALS patients and
astrocytes derived from iPSCs of ALS patients have been
shown to be toxic to healthy (WT) MNs [5, 6]. Similar
results were obtained by primary astrocytes isolated
from the hSOD1G93A mouse model with both WT and
MNs derived from ALS [7, 8]. The toxic effect of
astrocytes on MNs was also demonstrated by addition of
astrocyte condition medium [9, 10]. This lead to the
notion that astrocytes of ALS patients secrete toxic/mu-
tated proteins that cause specific death of MNs. This
hypothesis is also supported by in-vivo studies in the
hSOD1G93A high copy number ALS models [11–14].
Another proposed mechanism is the reduction of func-
tional astrocytic glutamate uptake suggested to contrib-
ute to glutamate excitotoxicity found in ALS patients
[15]. GLT-1, a glutamate transporter (aka EAAT2), was
found impaired in ALS patients [16, 17]. In-vivo studies
have demonstrated that focal loss of GLT-1 in the ven-
tral horn of the spinal cord precedes disease onset in a
transgenic rat model for ALS overexpressing SOD1 [18].
Transplantation of SOD1(G93A) glial-restricted precur-
sor cells–glial progenitors that are capable of differenti-
ating into astrocytes in the cervical spinal cord of WT
rats induced host MN ubiquitination and death, fore-
limb motor and respiratory dysfunction, and reactive
astrocytosis and reduced GLT-1 transporter expression
in WT animals [11].
Inflammation-mediated neuronal injury is also recog-
nized as a major factor to promote ALS disease progres-
sion and amplifies MN death-inducing processes. The
neuroimmune activation is not only a physiological reac-
tion to cell-autonomous death, but also an active compo-
nent of non-autonomous cell death. Astrocytes participate
in the cellular response to damage and danger signals by
releasing inflammation-related molecules like NO, IL-6,
INF-γ, Prostaglandin D2, TGF-β and TNF-α that can
induce the apoptosis of neurons observed in ALS disease
[19–23]. In both physiological and pathological condi-
tions, astrocytes secrete a wide range of factors with
multiple influences on their cellular neighbors.
In addition, disruption of the astrocytic TNFR1–
GDNF axis accelerates MN degeneration and disease
progression, as the levels of the protective agents for
MNs, glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), are
reduced [24]. Astrocytes in the ALS rat model acquire
an accelerated senescent phenotype that shows reduced
support in MNs, that can be partially reversed by GDNF
[25]. Another factor that plays a role in ALS pathology is
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), originally
described as a factor with a regulatory role in vascular
growth and development but it also directly affects neur-
onal cells [26, 27]. Transgenic mice expressing reduced
levels of VEGF develop late-onset MN pathology, similar
to that of ALS [28, 29]. VEGF is secreted by astrocytes
and has been shown to protect MNs from excitotoxic
death, as occurs in ALS [30]. In line with these results,
low levels of VEGF and GDNF were reported in the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of ALS patients [31]. Other
mechanisms include activation of necroptosis [32] and
mitochondrial alterations [33–37].
These observations led to the rationale that ALS could
be treated by implantation of normal wild-type healthy
astrocytes from an external source, to support or replace
dysfunctional ALS astrocytes [38]. In the present work,
we have used human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as a
source for large-scale production of astrocyte progenitor
cells (APCs), which can be stored as frozen banks. These
APCs can be further expanded and differentiated into an
enriched population of young committed astrocytes by
removal of the growth factors for 7 days (hES-AS),
which demonstrate functional properties of “healthy” as-
trocytes in vitro. These properties include: uptake of glu-
tamate; production and secretion of a wide diversity of
neuroprotective factors, as seen by secretome analysis;
promotion of axonal outgrowth; and protection of MNs
from oxidative stress. In animal ALS models (high-copy
number hSOD1G93A transgenic mice and rats), we show
that intrathecal injection of hES-AS into the CSF of
hSOD1G93A mice and rats had significant effects on delay-
ing disease onset, maintaining motor performances and
delayed death. To obtain safety data that are relevant to

 both hES-AS and to their proposed clinical use, we con-
ducted long-term safety and toxicology studies in NSG
immune-deficient mice. These studies were designed to
address key safety aspects associated with direct adminis-
tration of hES-AS into the CSF by intrathecal injection,
including toxicity, biodistribution, long-term engraftment
and formation of tumors.
Results
Direct differentiation of hESCs into astrocyte progenitor
cells and young astrocytes
Two hESC lines (HADC100 and NCL-14) were used to
produce astrocytes for engraftment in hSOD1G93A ALS
animal models. Both hESC lines had a normal karyotype,
expressed pluripotency markers and were capable of
differentiating into all three embryonic germ layers
[39, 40]. We modified our previously reported protocol
[41] to generate an enriched population of APCs from
hESCs, followed by further differentiation of the APCs
into functional astrocytes (Fig. 1a). The protocol was
optimized to include good medical practice (GMP)-grade
materials and factors to be compatible for clinical use. In
brief, hESC cultures having at least 70% of pluripotent
stem cells expressing the SSEA4, TRA-1-60 and EPCAM
markers were used as a starting material. The hESCs were
detached and cultured in suspension with stepwise
changes in media composition (Fig. 1a, b). First, all-trans
retinoic acid and EGF were added for 7 days. This elicited
increased production of bone morphogenetic factors (i.e.
BMP4, BMP6, BMP2, BMP7 and BMP11), which were
found to be essential for obtaining glial restricted cells,
particularly astrocyte lineage cells [41, 42]. The suspension
culture was continued with EGF resulting in the formation
of neurospheres, which were seeded in 2D culture on
laminin. The cells were expanded by successive passages
in the presence of growth factors (bFGF and EGF) and
human serum with the doubling time being 21 ± 2.6 h.
This produced APCs that can be stored as frozen cell
banks. The APC karyotype was tested at different passages
(up to passage 12) and was found normal (Fig.1c). Flow
cytometry analysis of APCs showed that the levels of
pluripotent markers, SSEA-4, EPCAM and Tra-1-60, were
< 0.2% (Fig. 1e). Above 90% of APCs were positive for the
astrocytic marker CD44 [43] (Fig. 1d). The APCs had
additional astrocytic markers such as the Glutamate
Aspartate Transporter (GLAST, aka Excitatory Amino
Acid Transporter 1 (EAAT1)) [44], glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP) [45] and Aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) [46], as
well as neuroepithelial stem cell markers Nestin, A2B5
and CXCR-4 (Fig. 1d). The frozen/thawed APCs were
further expanded for 2–3 weeks and then differentiated
toward committed astrocytes, by removing growth factors
EGF and bFGF as well as human serum from the media
and adding vitamin C. After 7 days without growth factors
(7-day astrocytes, hES-AS), flow cytometry showed that
the percentages of GLAST, GFAP and AQP-4 astrocytic
markers were increased compared to APCs (Fig. 1d).
Upon differentiation of APCs toward committed young
astrocytes there were no remaining undifferentiated cells,
as shown by the levels of TRA-1-60, SSEA-4 and EPCAM,
which remained < 0.1% (Fig. 1e), indicating high purity
and low risk of teratoma formation [47]. It is important to
note that only few Ki-67-positive cells were observed in
hES-AS cultures (Fig. 1f), indicating that most hES-AS
are post mitotic.
Biological functionality of hES-AS
Glutamate uptake capacity
The glutamate uptake capacity of hES-AS was tested by
incubating the cells in medium containing 0.5 mM glu-
tamate and measuring the remaining concentration of
the neurotransmitter at different times up to 120 min.
Astrocytes from human spinal cord served as positive
control and medium without cells as negative control.
As shown in Fig. 2a, the hES-AS take up glutamate from
the medium occurred in a time-dependent manner simi-
lar to the control human spinal cord astrocytes. After
2 h, more than 85% of the glutamate was removed from
the culture media.
To investigate whether GLT-1 (EAAT2) participates in
the glutamate uptake, the same experiment was done in
the presence of either WAY-213,613 (1 μM) or dihydro-
kainic acid (DHK, 500 μM) [48]. With either of these
GLT-1 inhibitors (Fig. 2b) the removal of glutamate in
60 min was inhibited by 60% (from 64.1% removal in the
control to 25% with the inhibitors), demonstrating that a
significant part of the glutamate uptake can be attributed
to GLT-1 activity in the hES-AS.
Neuroprotective effect against oxidative stress
Cultures of mouse spinal cord MNs were challenged
with 150 μM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The number of
apoptotic MNs was measured after staining for activated
caspase-3 and the total number of MNs being measured
by staining for tubulin-β3. Using high-content image
screening analysis, we calculated the percentage of apop-
totic MNs (seen as yellow cells, Fig. 3b, left panel). The
results (Fig. 3a) indicate a significant decrease (p < 0.05)
in MN death by adding conditioned medium from the
hES-AS, as seen by the decrease in caspase-3-positive
cells (Fig. 3b, right panel). When the hES-AS were
added in coculture with the MNs, there was a greater
decrease in apoptosis resulting from oxidative stress
(Fig. 3a, p < 0.01) to levels similar to spontaneous apop-
tosis. These results demonstrate the neuroprotective
effects by hES-AS in vitro.

 hES-AS stimulate axonal outgrowth in vitro
We next assessed the ability of hES-AS to induce axonal
outgrowth in vitro. Rat primary cortical neurons derived
from day 18 embryos were precultured for 2 days in
Neurobasal medium (with B27) and then further cul-
tured for 4 more days in either medium alone or
supplemented with 10 ng/ml Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3, as
positive control), or cocultured with hES-AS (1–2 × 104
cells), or cocultured with hES-AS conditioned medium
(collected from days 5 to 7 of astrocyte differentiation).
The cultures were labeled by ICF with antibodies against
axonal neurofilament-160 and GFAP markers. Represen-
tative images of the five conditions are shown in Fig. 4a.
By high-content image screening analysis, the total area of
axons and neurites in the NF160-stained images was deter-
mined. A significant increase in axonal outgrowth was seen
in the neurons cocultured with hES-AS (Fig. 4b, p < 0.01).
Moreover, addition of the hES-AS conditioned medium
was found to stimulate axonal outgrowth to a similar
extent as compared to the cocultures, indicating that

 this neurogenic activity can be attributed to factors se-
creted by these astrocytes. As expected, GFAP-positive
cells were observed only in the cocultures, indicating
that the rat cortical neurons were not contaminated by
rat astrocytes.
Neurotrophic factor synthesis and secretion
We first measured the levels of known neurotrophic
factors GDNF, BDNF, VEGF and IGF-I both in hES-AS
culture supernatant media and in cell extracts (cell con-
tent). VEGF was found to be secreted from hES-AS that
were differentiated without growth factors for 28 days
(Additional file 1: Figure S1). IGF-1 was also secreted,
whereas GDNF and BDNF were found inside the cells
but less was secreted (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The
levels of these classical neurotrophic factors were in the
range found in human CSF [49, 50].
To have a more comprehensive view of the factors
secreted by 7-day and 28-day differentiated hES-AS, we
carried out secretome analysis. The 48-h conditioned
medium of replica cultures of hES-AS were analyzed using
the human Quantibody Kiloplex Array (RayBiotech), cap-
able of detecting 1000 proteins. A total of 220 protein fac-
tors were found to be secreted at levels over the threshold
in 7-day hES-AS, about 25% of which being more abun-
dant at 28 days (see Additional file 2: Table S1). Among
the highest 120, there were 25 proteins with activities in
neurogenesis, axon or neurite outgrowth or axon guidance.
Interestingly, there were 13 proteins with antiprotease
activity. In addition, there were extracellular matrix (ECM)
components, cell adhesion membrane proteins and a few
peptidases. This indicates that there is a complex set of
factors secreted by the hES-AS, beyond the classical neuro-
trophic factors. Many of these factors may be responsible
for the neurogenic and neuroprotective activities observed
earlier. Examples of the secreted factors with effects on
neurons or with antiprotease activity are presented in
Table 1. Several of these factors may be relevant for poten-
tial therapeutic mechanism of action in ALS (e.g. Osteo-
pontin, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and
TIMP-2, Midkine, MIF; see Discussion).
Transplantation of hES-AS in SOD1G93A mouse and rat
ALS models
Both SOD1G93A mouse and rat models present a typical
pattern of ALS disease progression, in which onset of
the disease in hindlimbs precedes that in forelimbs, and
in which the end stage results from compromised
respiratory function [18, 51]. A dose of 2 × 106 hES-AS
(differentiated for 7 days) were injected into the CSF of
hSOD1G93A mice through the cisterna magna (CM),
either once on day 67 ± 2 after birth or twice on days 67
± 2 and 97 ± 2 (Additional file 3: Figure S2). Disease
onset was determined by the loss of 3% of maximal body
weight. Results demonstrate that double transplantation
of the hES-AS significantly delayed disease onset com-
pared to sham-injected controls (Additional file 3: Figure
S2A; median 119 days vs 112 days; p = 0.0012, log-rank),
and was better than with a single injection. Motor per-
formance, as measured by Rotarod test as well as by neuro-
logical scoring, was significantly improved in mice that were
injected twice with hES-AS, compared to sham-injected

 mice (Additional file 3: Figure S2D, E; p < 0.05). Two injec-
tions were better than a single dose. The survival of mice
injected twice with hES-AS was somewhat prolonged com-
pared to sham-injected mice (Additional file 3: Figure S2B;
median survival 130 days vs 126.5 days; but p = 0.1,
log-rank). With the double injection there was also a trend
for longer survival at late times, compared to one injection.
We then shifted to the rat hSOD1G93A ALS model,
which allows use of intrathecal injection by lumbar punc-
ture (LP), a route of administration similar to what could
be applied in human patients. The rat model also allowed
administration of more cells. A total of 6 × 106 hES-AS
(differentiated for 7 days) was administered divided into
two injections, the first on day 50 ± 2 after birth and the
second on day 70 ± 2. A control group was sham-injected
with the vehicle solution. The LP injections were in the
subarachnoid space between L5 and L6 vertebra. The
median survival of the hES-AS-treated rats was 216 days
compared to 182 days in the sham-injected rats (Fig. 5a);
Kaplan–Meier analysis for the entire experiment showed
an increased survival trend (p = 0.077 by area under the
curve (AUC) analysis). The disease onset was delayed very
significantly by hES-AS treatment (Fig. 5b, p = 0.0001);
Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that 50% of treated rats
lost 3% of their body weight by day 175 compared to day
157 in the sham-injected group. The hES-AS-treated rats
maintained their body weight significantly longer (by
about 30 days) than sham-injected rats (Fig. 5c, p = 0.007).
A set of motor tests demonstrated the therapeutic
effect of the hES-AS treatment. First the overall devel-
opment of clinical symptoms, as evaluated by open field
neurological scoring, was significantly delayed (Fig. 5d,
p < 0.001). The decline of motor functionality, as mea-
sured by “time to fall” from a Rotarod, was markedly
slowed down by hES-AS treatment, the animals main-
taining normal motor activity for more than 1 month
longer than the controls (Fig. 5e, p < 0.001). Likewise,
the loss of forelimb muscle strength, as measured by
the grip strength test, was significantly slowed down,
just as the Rotarod performance (p < 0.001; data not
shown). Other observations were that no tumors were
observed in the animals post mortem.

 Assessment of safety, tumorigenicity and biodistribution
of hES-AS following a single injection to the cisterna
magna of NSG mice
The safety, tumorigenicity and biodistribution phases were
conducted in compliance with principles of good laboratory
practice (GLP) over a period of up to 9 months. hES-AS,
differentiated for 7 days, were injected intrathecally into the
CSF of NSG mice through the CM with 0.4 × 106 cells/
mouse, or with a vehicle. Mice were sacrificed 4, 17 and
39 weeks post transplantation. No clinical signs were
attributable to treatment during the monitoring periods.
Cell-injected mice made similar body weight gain by 4, 17
and 39 weeks post dose to the vehicle control groups. In
addition, there were no differences from the vehicle control
at the hematological and blood chemistry investigations at
4, 17 and 39 weeks after dose administration (data not
shown). Histopathological evaluation of the brain and
spinal cord was performed to assess tumorigenicity. No
teratoma or other tumors that could be related to the treat-
ment were seen in the transplanted animals in any of tested
time points. In order to evaluate the hES-AS distribution in
the CNS, the sections were stained using an in-situ
hybridization (ISH) technique with a human-specific Alu Y
sequence. Cells positive for Alu Y sequences were present
at all levels of the CNS in similar incidences between the
three study time points. The incidence for the various levels
range between 17% (distal areas from injection site) and
80% (at vicinity of the injection site) after 4 weeks, between
13% and 97% after 17 weeks and between 21% and 96%
after 39 weeks (Fig. 6 and Additional file 4: Table S2). The
cells were almost uniformly seen along the meninges,
attached to the pia mater. To assess the biodistribution of
hES-AS outside the CNS, the detection of human cells in
mouse tissues was performed by quantitative real-time PCR
(qPCR), targeting the specific sequence of the human Alu
sequence. The detection was performed in nine organs
including the spleen, kidney, testis/ovary, liver, heart, bone
marrow of the femur, lungs, and cervical lymph nodes. The
qPCR method was validated prior to the study and both
the limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification
(LOQ) were set at one human cell (DNA equivalent) per
1 μg of mouse DNA. The PCR results showed no detection
of human DNA above the LOD in any of the tested organs
4 and 17 weeks after transplantation.
We also examined the astrocytic identity of hES-AS in
vivo 2 months after their transplantation in the CSF of
immunodeficient
mice.
Histological
sections
were
stained for the general human cytoplasmic specific
marker
Stem121
and
for
Stem123
(human-specific
GFAP antibody) in order to ascertain the presence of
human cells. All Stem121-positive cells were positive for
human
GFAP,
demonstrating
that
the
transplanted
hES-AS maintained their astrocytic identity in the CSF
(Fig. 7). Further staining for the cell cycle marker
Ki67 showed that 0.33 ± 0.15% of Stem121-positive
cells in the CSF were also positive for Ki67, indicating
for the very low proliferative capacity of hES-AS in
vivo (Fig. 7g).

 therapeutic activity in vivo following intrathecal injection
into the CSF of transgenic SODG93A rats and mice. In
addition, we describe the results of a preclinical safety
study in immunodeficient mice to assess the tumorigen-
icity potential and biodistribution of hES-AS in target
and distal organs.
To date, two FDA-approved drugs, riluzole and Radi-
cava, were shown to modestly attenuate motor deterior-
ation in ALS patients [52–55]. Still, many late-phase
clinical trials failed to demonstrate a significant improve-
ment in slowing down disease progression when using
single-target drugs [56]. ALS is a multifactorial disease
and therapeutic approaches should take into account the
multiplicity of mechanisms that underlie MN degener-
ation in this disease. Thus, a potential therapy that acts
through multiple mechanisms of action to treat the
broad pathological aspects of the disease is more likely
to be effective. An example for the complexity of the
disease is the involvement of astrocytes in the degener-
ation of MNs [5, 7, 8, 57]. Such noncell autonomous
death of MNs caused by ALS-type astrocytes supports
the rationale that transplantation of healthy human as-
trocytes into the CNS of ALS patients may compensate
for the malfunctional astrocytes and rescue dying MNs
(review in [38]).
hES-AS exhibit multiple activities that were shown to
be impaired in ALS-type astrocytes. Astrocytes from
ALS transgenic mice express more iNOS/NOS2, leading
to increased release of NO, which exacerbates oxidative
stress leading to MN death [58]. We show in our study
that hES-AS protect in-vitro spinal cord MNs from
oxidative stress produced by H2O2. In ALS patients, a
decrease of the astroglial GLT-1 glutamate transporter is
observed [16], leading to decreased glutamate uptake in
the synaptic clefts of the spinal cord. Accumulation of
excitatory glutamate makes MNs in ALS more suscep-
tible to excitotoxicity [59]. hES-AS express both glutam-
ate transporters GLAST and GLT-1 and efficiently
uptake glutamate, which is in part due to their GLT-1
expression, as shown by GLT-1 inhibitors. Another
mechanism by which the diseased astrocytes lead to MN
death is by a decrease in the secretion of neurotrophic
factors. hES-AS produce and secrete the neurotrophic
factors GDNF, BDNF, IGF-1 and VEGF in a comparable
amount to that of endogenous astrocytes. The neuro-
tropic property of hES-AS was demonstrated by cocul-
tures of hES-AS with neurons and by hES-AS conditioned
medium alone, indicating activity of soluble secreted
factors. Secreted VEGF is likely to play an important
role by protecting neurons in ALS, reducing excitotoxi-
city [28, 60], and its concentration is lower in the CSF
of ALS patients [31]. In addition, GDNF synergizes with
VEGF to prolong survival in a murine ALS model [61].
Intrathecal injection of CSF from sporadic ALS patients
to neonatal rats induces selective degeneration of MNs
[62] and downregulates the levels of both BDNF and
IGF-1 in the spinal cord [63]. Supplementation of
BDNF reverses the neurodegenerative changes induced
by ALS-CSF in MN cultures [64].
The nature of the secreted factors was further investi-
gated by a secretome analysis, clearly illustrating the pleio-
tropic activity of the cells. hES-AS secrete many factors
having activities on neurons [65, 66–68] as well as several
antiproteases and factors which could remodel the ECM
(see Table 1). Among the more abundant factors found in
the secretome analysis, several have been linked to ALS,
thereby shedding new light on the possible mechanisms of

 action underlying the observed therapeutic effect in ALS
models. One of the most abundant factors in the secre-
tome is Osteopontin (OPN/SSP1), which in the mutant
SOD1 model of ALS is found to be associated with MNs
that are more resistant to degeneration early in the dis-
ease, but low in the MNs more vulnerable to degeneration
in ALS [69]. Conversely, the vulnerable MNs are high in
matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9 (MMP9high /OPNlow),
whereas MMP-9 is low and OPN is high in the
ALS-resistant MNs [69, 70]. Exogenous addition of OPN
has neurogenic effects, stimulating regeneration of motor
axons [71] and protecting neurons after ischemia in vitro
and in vivo [72]. Although MMP9 was not detected in the
secretome of our astrocyte cultures, inhibitors of MMP9
and other matrix metalloproteases were abundantly se-
creted, particularly the tissue inhibitors of metallopro-
teases TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, which play a major role in
preventing degradation of ECM components by MMPs or
regulating ECM remodeling (review in [73]). Another
chemokine found in the secretome is MIF, which has the
capacity to save primary MNs from the degeneration
caused by the ALS mutant SOD1 form, probably by acting
as a chaperone [74]. Also secreted is Clusterin, another
chaperone, promoting axon regeneration, as observed on
peripheral sensory neurons [71], and increasing neuron
survival [75]. Midkine secreted by astrocytes is a known
neurotrophic factor promoting neurite outgrowth and
neuron survival (review in [76]). The multiple nature of
the factors secreted by the hES-AS supports a mode of
action much more diversified than merely through the
classical neurotrophic factors.
The efficacy of hES-AS to delay disease onset and to
ameliorate disease progression was evaluated in trans-
genic high copy number SOD1G93A mouse and rat
models, which recapitulate many of the clinical symp-
toms of the ALS disease in humans [18, 51, 77]. Intra-
thecal injection of hES-AS significantly delayed the
onset of the disease and slowed down the deterioration
of motor function. These effects were more pronounced
when the cells were administered twice (3–4 weeks

 apart) than with a single injection. Intrathecal injection
into the CSF is in line with the proposed mode of
action, in which the healthy astrocytes would work at a
distance to modify the environment of brain and spinal
cord MNs. Indeed, the CSF composition shows several
changes in the course of ALS [78, 79], including an
increase in oxidative stress markers, an increase in
glutamate in at least 40% of patients and variations of
VEGF concentration correlating with the length of
survival [80], and other changes including OPN in-
crease [81]. Moreover, the fact that inoculation of CSF
from ALS patients to animals is neurotoxic [63] dem-
onstrates that materials injected into the CSF can
affect the parenchyma.
A major safety concern associated with pluripotent stem
cell-based therapies is the presence of residual undifferen-
tiated stem cells that might continue to divide without
control or develop teratoma after their transplantation in
the body [82, 83]. We minimize the possibility of teratoma
formation by assuring a complete differentiation of hESCs
into committed astrocytes with a normal diploid karyo-
type and minimal proliferation capacity. Teratoma forma-
tion from undifferentiated hESCs depends on several
factors, among them the site of implantation and number
of transplanted cells. Several studies reported that undif-
ferentiated hESCs develop teratomas within 6 weeks after
transplantation in immunodeficient mice [47, 82, 84, 85].
We previously reported that injection of undifferentiated

 hESCs intrathecally into immunodeficient mice results in
teratoma formation within 5–7 weeks after injection [86].
In our current study, we evaluated the formation of
teratomas, or any other tumor, by hES-AS up to 39 weeks
after their intrathecal injection, long enough to allow
development of teratomas. Histology evaluation showed
the cells survived in the CSF for the entire duration of the
study, attached to the pia mater along the neuroaxis, The
cells uniformly expressed astrocytic markers with very rare
coexpression of the cell cycle marker Ki67. Importantly,
hES-AS did not develop teratoma or any other tumors in
any of the treated mice. In line with these results, Priest et
al. [87] also reported the absence of teratomas in the CNS
following intraspinal injection of oligodendrocyte progeni-
tors derived from hESCs into the spinal cord of immuno-
deficient rats.
To access the CNS, we chose the CSF as the injection
site for hES-AS. The circulating CSF helps to distribute
the injected cells throughout the subarachnoid space. In
addition, injection into the CSF by LP is a common
low-risk
medical
practice
already
demonstrated
in
several clinical trials with cell-based therapies [88–91]. A
biodistribution evaluation of hES-AS in the CNS was
performed by in-situ hybridization of the Alu Y gene at
4, 17 or 39 weeks following a single intrathecal injection
of cells into immunodeficient mice. The analysis re-
vealed the presence of hES-AS cells in the subarachnoid
space throughout the entire CNS. Cell numbers were
maintained stable over time, supporting that the cells re-
main quiescent in the CSF. The effective biodistribution
of hES-AS along the entire CSF supports the clinical
benefits we observed in SOD1G93A models. We found an
attenuation in motor activity loss in both lower and
upper limbs and the tail, indicating that the cells exert
their activity on multiple regions of the CNS. The pos-
sible migration of cells to distant organs was evaluated
by qPCR for amplification of the Alu Y genomic se-
quence in nine organs. hES-AS were not found in any
distant organ above the detection limit of the method (1
cell) at 4 and 17 weeks after their intrathecal injection.
This confined distribution of the cells to the CNS mini-
mizes any possible risk of presence of ectopic glial tissue
in nontarget organs outside the CNS.
Large quantities of human astrocytes would be needed
for the treatment of ALS patients worldwide. As shown
here, clinical-grade human ESCs provide a robust and
controlled source of cells for mass production of glial
progenitors that can give rise to functional astrocytes. To
comply with GMP standards, we adjusted our previous
protocol, originally aimed to produce both astrocytes and
oligodendrocytes [41], to include only GMP-grade mate-
rials. Under this protocol, large amounts of astrocyte pro-
genitor cells (APCs) are obtained, which can be frozen in
liquid nitrogen for long-term storage [41] as master and
working cell banks for future expansion. Upon thawing of
the APC vial, the differentiation into hES-AS is completed

 within 7 days of culturing. In terms of yield, using our
protocol we can produce a total of 2 × 1013 hES-AS from
a single batch of hESCs. Hence, the process described here
is suitable for mass production of clinical-grade hES-AS
per batch, which can potentially treat thousands of pa-
tients [92, 93].
In recent years, clinical trials of cell therapy in ALS
have mainly used autologous transplantation of mesen-
chymal stem or stromal cells (MSCs) [89, 94], in which
cells are taken from the patients and after in-vitro
culture are returned to the same patient. While giving
promising clinical efficacy, these autologous transplan-
tations have limitations and it would be advantageous
to develop allogeneic cells as a shelf-product that would
provide a treatment for all ALS patients. Given that
intrathecal administration is effective (as seen with the
MSCs), it would be easier than injections in the spinal
cord anterior horn, which requires major surgery as
done in recent ALS clinical trials with neural stem cells
taken from human organ donors [95, 96]. Future
clinical trials could use human pluripotent stem cell
cultures for mass production of neural cells, either
from human iPSCs [97, 98] or from human ES cell lines
as described here.
Conclusions
Here we describe the derivation of a highly enriched
population of functional, clinical-grade, human astrocytes
(hES-AS) from embryonic stem cells. The hES-AS were
shown to protect MNs by multiple mechanisms, similarly
to normal astrocytes, including clearance of glutamate,
secretion of multiple NTFs, neutralization of ROS and
promotion of neural outgrowth. Intrathecal injection of
hES-AS to rodent models of ALS delays disease onset,
slows down disease progression and extends life expect-
ancy. A 9-month safety study conducted in an immunode-
ficient NSG animal model, under GLP conditions, showed
that intrathecal transplantation of hES-AS cells to the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is safe. Thus, these findings
demonstrate the feasibility, safety and potential efficacy of
intrathecal injections of hES-AS for the treatment of ALS.
The safety and efficacy of hES-AS treatment in ALS
patients will be tested in a phase I/IIa clinical trial (Clini-
calTrials.gov identifier: NCT03482050).
Methods
Derivation of astrocyte progenitor cells and committed
astrocytes from hESCs
Two clinical-grade hESC lines, were used: NCL14, licensed
from the University of Newcastle; and HADC100,
obtained from the Hadassah Medical Organization
(HMO), Jerusalem (Prof. Benjamin Reubinoff). Master
cell banks (MCB) and working cell banks (WCB) of
these hESCs were created at Kadimastem Ltd. The
undifferentiated state of the hESCs was routinely
assessed by flow cytometry analysis of the surface
markers SSEA-4, EpCAM and TRA-1-60, and by im-
munofluorescence staining for the transcription factors
NANOG and OCT4. Both lines were propagated in
undifferentiated state on a HFF feeder layer (25,000
cells/cm2) by passaging every 6–7 days using collage-
nase in order to detach the whole hESC colonies from
the feeder cell layers. The colonies were mechanically
broken and seeded in a ratio of 1:3–6. The hESCs were
grown in ES1 media composed of KO-DMEM, 14% (v/v)
KO serum replacement, 2 mM glutamine, 1× MEM non-
essential amino acids, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol and
25 U/ml penicillin, 25 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Life
Technologies) and 8 ng/ml bFGF (R&D). Important to
note is that for generation of clinical-grade hESCs, the
cells were adapted to feeder free conditions and the media
composition was changed to Essential 8™ (E8) medium
(Thermo Fischer Scientific).
Formation of neurospheres (NS) was done in suspension
(3D) cultures. In brief, the harvested hESC colonies were
transferred into 100-mm ultralow attachment culture plates
(Corning) containing ITTSPP/B27 medium. ITTSPP/B27 is
a mixture of DMEM/F12 containing 1% B27 supplement,
1% Glutamax, 1.5% Hepes at pH 7.4 (all from Thermo Sci-
entific), 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin solution
(Biological Industries), 25 μg/ml human insulin (ActRapid;
Novo Nordisk), 50 μg/ml human Apo-transferrin (Athens),
6.3 ng/ml progesterone, 10 μg/ml putrescine, 50 ng/ml
sodium selenite and 40 ng/ml triiodothyronine (T3) (all
from Sigma). ITTSPP/B27 was supplemented with 20 ng/
ml r-human EGF (R&D Systems). After 2 days, the medium
was switched to ITTSPP/B27 supplemented with 20 ng/ml
EGF and 10 μM ATRA (Sigma). The culture was continued
in suspension in the nonadherent plates for 7 days with
daily replacement of the medium (stage 2; Fig. 1). During
the last step, which allows for NS ripening, the culture was
continued in ITTSPP/B27 medium supplemented with
20 ng/ml EGF for 18 days. Medium was replaced every
other day (stage 3; Fig. 1). For APC expansion, round yel-
low NS were manually selected using a stereoscopic micro-
scope and transferred into six-well plates coated with
Matrigel or GMP-compliant laminin 521 (from Biolamina)
in ITTSPP/B27 supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF. Medium
was replaced every other day for 7–10 days (passage 0). In
order to produce a monolayer, the spheres were dissociated
with TryplE (Thermo Scientific) and reseeded on ECM
(passage 1) in N2/B27 medium consisting of DMEM/F12
with 0.5% (v/v) N2 supplement, 1% (v/v) B27 supplement,
1% Glutamax and 1.5% Hepes at pH 7.4 (all from Thermo
Scientific). The growth factors EGF and bFGF (R&D
Systems) were added at 10 ng/ml each. The monolayer cells
were further passaged weekly until a sufficient number of
cells was generated. Cells were then frozen in liquid

 nitrogen and stored as banks of APCs. Thawed APCs were
further expanded as described earlier for 2–3 weeks. In
order to differentiate the APCs toward astrocytes, EGF and
bFGF were removed from the media, 50 μg/ml ascorbic
acid (Sigma) was added and the culture was continued for
7 or 28 days.
Immunocytofluorescence assays
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), washed
with PBS and kept at 4 °C before staining. Permeabilization
was done by 0.5% Triton X-100 in Blocking solution (5%
BSA; Sigma) and 3% horse serum (w/v in PBS; Biological
Industries). Incubation in the same blocking solution was
done for 1 h at RT. Primary antibodies, diluted in blocking
solution, were as follows: anti-Nanog, anti-Nestin (1:500;
BD Pharmingen), anti-GFAP-cy3 (mouse monoclonal anti-
body (Mc), 1:500; Sigma), anti-GLAST (rabbit Mc, 1:100;
Miltenibiotec), anti-S100 (rabbit polyclonal antibody, 1:100;
DAKO), anti-AQP-4 (rabbit, 1:2000; Mc Abcam) and
anti-Ki67 (rabbit, 1:50; Mc Cell Marque). After overnight
incubation at 4 °C, secondary antibody (1:200; Jackson
Immuno Research) was added for 1 h at RT, followed
by the nuclear fluorescent dye DAPI (0.05 μg/ml;
Sigma). Pictures were taken using Arrayscan VTI
(Thermo Scientific, Cellomics).
Immunohistochemical staining
Brain and spinal cord tissues were trimmed, decalcified
and embedded in paraffin, sectioned at approximately
5 μm thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E). For immune-cytofluorescence assays, tissues were
deparaffinized using the following washes: xylene (Sigma),
two washes × 5 min; 100% ethanol, two washes × 5 min;
95% ethanol, one wash × 5 min; 70% ethanol, one wash ×
5 min; and cold tap water, two washes × 5 min.
Heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed by boiling
the sections in a domestic microwave, twice for 10 min,
using 100× H-3300 citrate-based solution (Vector Labora-
tories). Permeabilization was done by 0.5% Triton X-100
in blocking solution as described earlier, and incubation
continued in the same blocking solution for 1 h at RT.
Primary mouse Mc antibody Stem123 or Stem121 (1:500;
Stem Cells) were added overnight and kept at 4 °C.
Secondary antibody goat anti mouse Cy2 or Cy3 (1:200;
Jackson Immuno Research) were added for 1 h at RT,
followed by the nuclear fluorescent dye DAPI (0.05 μg/ml;
Sigma).
Karyotype
The test was performed using spectral karyotyping
analysis (SKY) on cells from two APC banks (passages
11 and 12). The analysis was performed by the Stem
Cell Core and Advanced Cell Technologies Unit,
Department of Life Sciences Core Facilities, Weizmann
Institute of Science.
Flow cytometry
Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for identity and pur-
ity markers using the following antibodies: anti-A2B5
(1:20; Miltenibiotec), anti-GLAST (1:20; Miltenibiotec),
anti-CD44 (1:20; BD Pharmingen), anti-CXCR4 (1:20;
Biolegend), anti-TRA-1-60 (1:50; Biolegend), anti-EPCAM
(1:50; Biolegend), anti-SSEA4 (1:50; Biolegend), anti-GFAP
(1:2000; Sigma), Nestin (1:500; BD Pharmingen) and
anti-AQP-4 (1:2000; Abcam). The Flow Cytometer FACS
Canto II (BD) was operated with FACSDIVA software
(BD). At least 10,000 events were collected per sample.
Glutamate uptake assay
Glutamate uptake capability of the cells was measured in
28-day differentiated hESC-derived astrocytes. Glutamic
acid (0.5 mM; Sigma) in Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution
(Gibco) was added to 1 × 106 cells/ml. After 0, 10, 30, 60
and 120 min, the solution was aspirated and kept at 4 °C
until further testing. Human astrocytes derived from the
spinal cord (from Thermo Scientific) served as positive
control, while 0.5 mM glutamic acid kept at 37 °C for
120 min served as negative control. In addition, 0.5 mM
glutamic acid kept at 4 °C for 120 min served as time 0
concentration control. The EnzyChrom™ Glutamate Assay
Kit (BioAssay Systems) was used to measure the concen-
tration of glutamate in the collected samples according to
the manufacturer’s protocol and recommendations. The
optical density was read at 565 nm using the iMark
Microplate reader (Bio Rad). Dihydrokainic acid (DHK,
500 μM; Sigma) or 1 μM WAY-213,613 (Sigma) were used
as inhibitors of GLT-1.
Secretome analysis
In order to promote astrocyte differentiation, APCs
were deprived from growth factors (bFGF and EGF)
and vitamin C was added for 7 days and 28 days.
Conditioned media were collected after 48 h from each
experimental well. The number of cells for each well
was counted (at least two replicas per each cell type)
and secretome analysis was performed by multiplex
ELISA using the human quantibody kiloplex Array
(Raybiotech). The values obtained in secretome analysis
were normalized to 1 × 106 cells/ml.
Transplantation of hES-AS in the hSOD1G93A animal

Transgenic hSOD1G93A mice aged 8–9 weeks of mixed
gender (B6SJL-Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur/J) were purchased

 were purchased from Taconic Biosciences Inc. (Hudson,
NY, USA; http://www.taconic.com). All animal care and
surgical procedures described here were carried out accord-
ing to protocols approved by the Israeli National Commit-
tee for Animal Care. The animals were kept in a certified
animal facility in IVC cages with a light cycle of 12 h and at
temperature of 22 ± 2 °C. Rodent diet and drinking water
were provided ad libitum.
Intrathecal injection through the cisterna magna
Mice were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of keta-
mine/xylazine (K4138; Sigma) and then mounted on a
stereotaxic frame. The head was then bent, resulting in
nape distention. A midline skin incision was made at the
nape area to expose the sagittal suture of the cranium
and midline of the nape. Under a dissection microscope,
the subcutaneous tissue and muscles were separated by
blunt dissection with forceps to expose the cleft between
the occipital bone and the atlas vertebra. The muscles
were held apart to expose the dura mater which was
carefully penetrated using a 29G-gauge 45° beveled
needle (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) connected to a 10-μl
Hamilton syringe preloaded with 10 μl of cell suspension
or vehicle (DMEM/F12 medium). Then 2 × 106 hES-AS
(APCs differentiated for 7 days) were injected once on
day 67 ± 2 (CellsX1 group, n = 14 mice) or twice on day
67 ± 2 and on day 97 ± 2 at interval of 30 days (CellsX2
group, n = 13), or injected with DMEM F12 (Sham
group, n = 10) into the CSF through the CM. The
syringe was held in position for 3 min before being grad-
ually pulled away to avoid liquid outflow along the
needle tract. The skin cut was secured with stainless
steel surgical clips and wiped with 70% ethanol.
Injection of the cells by lumbar puncture
The rats were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine. The
lumbar region was shaved, sterilized with iodine and the
intervertebral spaces widened by placing the animal on a
15-ml conical plastic tube. The injections were per-
formed by inserting a 29-gauge 45° beveled needle
(Hamilton) connected to a 10-μl Hamilton syringe into
the tissues between the dorsal aspects of L5 and L6.
Correct subarachnoid positioning of the tip of the needle
was verified by a tail flick test. A volume of 10 μl
containing 3 × 106 APCs was injected twice on day 50 ±
2 and on day 70 ± 2 (n = 7), or vehicle (DMEM/12
medium, n = 7) was injected. The syringe was held in
position for 30 s before being progressively pulled away.
Immunosuppression
Immunosuppression was used only in the transplantation
experiment in SOD1G93A mice. In this experiment, Cyclo-
sporin A was given daily by intraperitoneal injection, at a
dose of 10 mg/kg, starting 3 days prior to the treatment
and lasting all throughout the duration of the experiment.
CellCept was administered orally twice a day at a dose of
15 mg/kg (total daily dose was 30 mg/kg). Dosing started
3 days prior to the treatment and lasted for a total of 10
consecutive days. Cohort 3, which was given the treatment
twice, started receiving CellCept 3 days prior to each treat-
ment injection for 10 consecutive days.
Measurements
Measurement of body weight and all motor tests took
place 7–10 days prior to cell transplantation and rou-
tinely afterward. Motor function was tested using an
acceleration Rotarod device (Rotarod 7650; Ugo Basile,
Comerio, Italy) for the duration of 180 s. The time it
took each mouse to fall from the rod was recorded.
Animals were trained for 1 week prior to conducting the
test. Forelimb muscle grip strength was determined
using a Grip Strength Meter 47,200 (UGO Basile). Grip
strength testing was performed by allowing the animals
to grasp a thin bar attached to the force gauge. This is
done by pulling the animal away from the gauge until
the mice forelimbs released the bar. The procedure
provides a value of the force of maximal grip strength.
The force measurements were recorded in three separate
trials, and the averages were used in the statistical
analysis. Neurological scoring was done according to
neurological score on a scale from 0 to 5 [99].
Statistical analysis
Kaplan–Meier analysis of the SOD1G93A mice and rats
was conducted using the statistical software Sigmastat
(SAS Software) to analyze survival, disease onset and dur-
ation data. Weight, time to fall from the Rotarod, neuro-
logical score and grip strength results were analyzed via
repeated-measures ANOVA. All data are presented as
mean ± SEM, and significance level was set at p ≤ 0.05.
Statistical analysis was performed by MediStat Ltd, Israel.
Transplantation of hES-AS in NSG mice
The mouse was mounted on a stereotaxic frame. A mid-
line skin incision was made at the nape area to expose the
sagittal suture of the cranium and midline of the nape.
The head was then bent, resulting in nape distention.
Under a dissection microscope, the subcutaneous tissue
and muscles were separated by blunt dissection with for-
ceps to expose the cleft between the occipital bone and
the atlas vertebra. The muscles were held apart to expose
the dura mater which was penetrated using a 29G needle
connected to a Hamilton syringe, preloaded with 10 μl of
0.4 × 106 hES-AS. The cells were injected within 30 s into
the CSF space. The needle was held for about 30 s
after injection and then withdrawn. The skin cut was
secured with stainless steel surgical clips and wiped
with polydine solution.
