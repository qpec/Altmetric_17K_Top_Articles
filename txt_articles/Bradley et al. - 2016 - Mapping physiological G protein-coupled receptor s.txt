G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are known to initiate a plethora
of signaling pathways in vitro. However, it is unclear which of these
pathways are engaged to mediate physiological responses. Here, we
examine the distinct roles of Gq/11-dependent signaling and receptor
phosphorylation-dependent signaling in bronchial airway contrac-
tion and lung function regulated through the M3-muscarinic acetyl-
choline receptor (M3-mAChR). By using a genetically engineered
mouse expressing a G protein-biased M3-mAChR mutant, we reveal
the first evidence, to our knowledge, of a role for M3-mAChR phos-
phorylation in bronchial smooth muscle contraction in health and in
a disease state with relevance to human asthma. Furthermore, this
mouse model can be used to distinguish the physiological responses
that are regulated by M3-mAChR phosphorylation (which include
control of lung function) from those responses that are downstream
of G protein signaling. In this way, we present an approach by which
to predict the physiological/therapeutic outcome of M3-mAChR–
biased ligands with important implications for drug discovery.
G protein-coupled receptor | asthma | muscarinic | ligand bias | signaling
A
irflow in the lung is limited by vagally derived ACh that me-
diates airway smooth muscle (ASM) contraction primarily
via activation of M3-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3-
mAChRs) (1). In both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, this activity can be up-regulated, leading to bronchocon-
striction and impaired lung function (1), thus explaining the ther-
apeutic benefits provided by anticholinergics, such as tiotropium
bromide (2).
M3-mAChRs can mediate ASM contraction through both calcium-
dependent and calcium-independent mechanisms (1). The calcium-
dependent mechanism is centered on Gq/11-mediated phospholipase
C activation generating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which mo-
bilizes calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum together with
promoting extracellular calcium entry that ultimately results in a
rise in intracellular calcium, activation of myosin-light chain ki-
nase, and the phosphorylation of myosin leading to contraction
(3). In contrast, the mechanism by which the M3-mAChR me-
diates calcium-independent ASM contraction is via activation of
the small GTPase RhoA, which, in turn, activates Rho-kinase. The
phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) phosphatase by Rho-
kinase decreases enzymatic activity, which results in higher levels of
phosphorylated myosin and smooth muscle contraction (3–5). Al-
though G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation of RhoA is
generally considered to be via Gq/11 and G12/13 heterotrimeric G
proteins (6), the mechanism by which the M3-mAChR activates the
RhoA pathway is unclear, with some researchers indicating that
activation might proceed in a G protein-independent manner and
possibly involve a direct interaction between the receptor and
RhoA (7). The prominence of the calcium-independent pathway in
the excessive airway narrowing (i.e., bronchial hyperresponsiveness)
previously observed in animal models of allergic bronchial asthma
has prompted the suggestion that inhibiting the M3-mAChR
pathways leading to RhoA activation might be of therapeutic
potential (8, 9).
GPCRs become rapidly phosphorylated following agonist stim-
ulation, and this phosphorylation results in the recruitment of
adaptor arrestin proteins that (i) uncouple receptors from their
cognate G proteins and (ii) act as signaling scaffolds to drive G
protein-independent signaling (10). The activation of RhoA
signaling has been identified as one of those pathways regulated
by receptor phosphorylation/arrestin-dependent signaling (11,
12). Because we have shown previously that the M3-mAChR is
multiply phosphorylated following agonist stimulation (13) and
Significance
Studies in transfected cells have established that G protein-
coupled receptors (GPCRs) activate a number of intracellular
signaling pathways; however, which of these pathways are phys-
iologically important is unclear. Here, we use a genetically engi-
neered mouse to demonstrate a novel role for M3-muscarinic
acetylcholine receptor (M3-mAChR) phosphorylation in air-
way constriction, with implications for human respiratory disease,
including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Combining this finding with other M3-mAChR physiological re-
sponses, we generate a map of responses that are downstream of
G protein-dependent signaling or receptor phosphorylation-
dependent signaling. Such a map predicts the outcome of biased
GPCR drugs designed to drive receptor signaling preferentially to-
ward pathways that improve therapeutic efficacy while minimizing
toxic/adverse outcomes and provides a fundamental approach to
the rational design of next-generation GPCR-based therapies.

 that removal of the phosphorylation sites on the receptor results in
the uncoupling of the M3-mAChR from arrestin, as well as arrestin-
dependent processes such as receptor internalization (14, 15), we
wanted to determine if M3-mAChR phosphorylation might play a
role in calcium-independent ASM contraction and regulate lung
function and airway hyperresponsiveness through this mechanism.
In addition, we aimed to establish an experimental system
whereby we might distinguish between GPCR-mediated physio-
logical responses that are downstream of G protein-dependent
signaling and those responses that are downstream of receptor
phosphorylation/arrestin-dependent signaling processes (16, 17).
In this way, we might develop an approach by which to predict
the physiological action of biased GPCR ligands, with important
implications for drug discovery.
To achieve these dual aims, we use here a mouse model in which
the M3-mAChR gene locus has been targeted to express a form
of the M3-mAChR that is mutated in its phosphorylation sites
(14, 15). This mutant receptor is uncoupled from phosphorylation-
dependent pathways, including the recruitment of arrestin (14), but
maintains coupling to Gq/11-dependent signaling (14, 15). In this
regard, this mutant receptor can be considered as G protein-biased.
Using this model, we determined a role for M3-mAChR phos-
phorylation in the regulation of lung function and in driving
allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. In addition, we were
able to include this analysis in a map of M3-mAChR physiological
responses that lay downstream of receptor phosphorylation/
arrestin-dependent signaling and, in this way, provide a pre-
dictive model for the action of biased ligands to the M3-mAChR.
Results
Phosphorylation-Deficient M3-mAChR Mutant Is Expressed in ASM and
Coupled Normally to Gq Signaling. We have previously established that
a mutant of the M3-mAChR, where 15 Ser phosphoacceptor sites in
the third intracellular loop were mutated to Ala, showed reduced
levels of agonist-mediated phosphorylation and significantly attenu-
ated coupling to arrestin and arrestin-dependent signaling while
maintaining near-normal coupling to Gq/11-dependent signaling (14,
15). Here, we present further evidence that G protein coupling of
the phosphodeficient M3-mAChR mutant is normal by evaluating
the coupling of both WT and mutant receptors to 10 different
Gα-subunits in a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer
(BRET)-based live cell assay (18, 19) (Fig. 1A). These experiments
demonstrated that the profile of G protein activation between the
WT M3-mAChR and the phosphodeficient mutant was very
similar, with both receptor types predominantly coupling to Gq
(Fig. 1 B and C). Importantly, there appeared to be no significant
coupling of the M3-mAChR to G12/13 proteins (Fig. 1 B and C).
Control experiments in which the receptor was not transfected
showed no significant activation of G proteins, including Gq (Fig.
S1 A and B).
A mutant mouse strain, termed M3-knockin (M3-KI), was gen-
erated, where the M3-mAChR gene locus was modified to express
the phosphodeficient M3-mAChR mutant in place of the WT re-
ceptor (14, 15). The muscarinic receptor expression levels in lungs
from M3-KI mice (determined by radioligand binding) were not
significantly different from the muscarinic receptor expression levels
in lungs from WT mice (Fig. S2 A and B). Furthermore, the levels of
the mutant receptor transcript in the lungs from M3-KI mice were
similar to the levels of the WT receptor in C57BL/6J mice as
determined by RT-PCR (Fig. S2C). Using an in-house Ab to the
M3-mAChR, we found a normal expression profile of the mutant
M3-mAChR in ASM of M3-KI mice, as indicated by colocalization
of immunostaining of the receptor and α-actin in airways (Fig. 1E).
M3-mAChR Mediates ASM Contraction in a Receptor Phosphorylation-
Dependent Manner. To determine the impact of mutating phos-
phorylation sites on the M3-mAChR in the lung, we used
precision cut lung slices (PCLS) to monitor bronchoconstriction
(20). In agreement with previous reports (21), we showed that
muscarinic receptor stimulation of PCLS from WT mice resulted
in a concentration-dependent narrowing of the airways [half-
maximum effective concentration (pEC50) = 5.47 ± 0.06, maxi-
mum drug effect (Emax) = 82.47 ± 5.82] (Fig. 2 A–D). In com-
parison, the responsiveness of PCLS from M3-KI mice was
significantly reduced in both maximal response and potency
(pEC50 = 4.01 ± 0.06, Emax = 40.79 ± 5.73) (Fig. 2 A–D and
Movies S1 and S2.). Importantly, the coupling of the phosphode-
ficient M3-mAChR mutant to Gq/calcium signaling in PCLS derived
from M3-KI mice was seen to be very similar to the coupling ob-
served in WT PCLS cultures (Fig. 2 E–G). Thus, despite normal
coupling to Gq/calcium mobilization, the mutant receptor expressed
in M3-KI mouse lung showed reduced airway contraction, in-
dicating an important role for receptor phosphorylation-dependent
signaling in M3-mAChR–mediated ASM contraction.
Because previous studies had established that the RhoA pathway
mediates calcium-independent ASM contraction (3–5), we in-
vestigated the role of RhoA signaling downstream of M3-mAChR
phosphorylation. In vitro analysis of RhoA activation using a FRET-
based biosensor (Fig. 3A) revealed that the phosphodeficient M3-
mAChR mutant coupled with >200-fold lower potency to the RhoA
pathway (pEC50 = 5.41 ± 0.63) than the WT receptor (pEC50 =
7.74 ± 0.17) (Fig. 3B). Activation of the RhoA pathway ultimately
results in the phosphorylation of MLC and smooth muscle con-
traction (3–5). Staining for phosphorylation of MLC on Ser-19
showed pronounced MLC phosphorylation in the ASM in PCLS
from WT animals in both the basal state and following carbachol
stimulation (Fig. 3C). In contrast, ASM in PCLS from M3-KI mice
showed substantially less MLC phosphorylation (Fig. 3D), a result
consistent with reduced activation of RhoA signaling in M3-KI air-
ways. Furthermore, the RhoA-kinase inhibitor H1152 reduced the
maximal M3-mAChR contractile response in PCLS from WT mice
by 43% and the potency of ACh-mediated contraction by >10-fold
(pEC50 was reduced from 5.07 ± 0.15 to 3.98 ± 0.13 following H1152
treatment) (Fig. 3 E–G). These data indicate that a significant
component of the M3-mAChR–mediated ASM contractile response
was independent of Gq/calcium signaling but was dependent on M3-
mAChR phosphorylation and the activation of the RhoA pathway.
Consistent with this notion was the fact that inhibition of M3-
mAChR–mediated Gq/calcium mobilization in PCLS from WT
mice using the recently characterized Gq inhibitor FR900359 (22)
(Fig. 3H and Fig. S3 A and B) did not affect the M3-mAChR–
mediated contractile response (Fig. 3 H and J). The concentration
of FR900359 used in these experiments (30 nM) completely
prevented the carbachol-mediated calcium response in PCLS

 (Fig. 3H) but had no significant effect on carbachol-mediated
smooth muscle contraction (Fig. 3 I and J). Importantly, inhibition
of Gq/calcium signaling with FR900359 did not significantly affect
the small contractile response seen in PCLS from M3-KI mice in
response to carbachol, (Fig. S4 A and B) and FR900359 did not
appear to affect the level of MLC phosphorylation in PCLS from
WT mice stimulated with carbachol (Fig. 3K). These data point
to RhoA-mediated signaling downstream of receptor phos-
phorylation having a prominent role in M3 receptor-mediated
ASM contraction.
Lung Function and Allergen-Associated Airway Hyperresponsiveness Are
Dependent on M3-mAChR Phosphorylation. To test if the reduction in
the contractile response of PCLS obtained from M3-KI mice
translated to changes in in vivo lung function, lung resistance in
response to ACh challenge in WT mice and M3-KI mice was
monitored. These studies revealed a rightward shift in the potency
and a decrease in the maximal response of the lung resistance in-
duced by administration of ACh in M3-KI mice (Fig. 4A). The de-
crease in lung resistance in response to ACh in the M3-KI mice was
also reflected in a significant increase in the concentration of ACh
required to elevate lung resistance by 100% (−logPC100) (Fig. 4B).
M3-mAChR signaling through RhoA in ASM has been closely
linked with experimentally induced airway hyperresponsiveness in
different studies using murine models of allergy (23, 24). We tested
here if the reduced coupling of the phosphodeficient M3-mAChR
mutant to RhoA signaling and the subsequent reduction in ASM
contraction observed in M3-KI mice had an impact on allergen-
induced airway hyperresponsiveness using a murine model of al-
lergic inflammatory airway disease (25). In these experiments, WT
mice sensitized with ovalbumin and challenged with saline (0.9%
NaCl) showed an increase in lung resistance to ACh that was sig-
nificantly augmented in mice sensitized with ovalbumin and chal-
lenged with ovalbumin (Fig. 4C), a response defined as classical
airway hyperresponsiveness (24, 26, 27). In contrast, M3-KI mice
sensitized with ovalbumin and challenged with ovalbumin showed
no hyperresponsiveness in response to ACh administration (Fig.
4C). The lack of hyperresponsiveness following ovalbumin sensiti-
zation/challenge in M3-KI mice was also reflected by the lack of
change in the −logPC100 value in M3-KI mice following ovalbumin
sensitization/challenge (Fig. 4D). Hence, the −logPC100 value fell
from 2.38 ± 0.02 in WT mice sensitized with ovalbumin and chal-
lenged with saline to 1.68 ± 0.06 after ovalbumin sensitization and
ovalbumin challenge, indicative of airway hyperresponsiveness (Fig.
4D). In contrast, the −logPC100 value for the M3-KI mice that were
ovalbumin-sensitized and saline-challenged (2.64 ± 0.17) was not
significantly different from the −logPC100 value for M3-KI mice
that had been ovalbumin-sensitized and ovalbumin-challenged
(2.59 ± 0.06) (Fig. 4D). These data indicate that M3-mAChR
phosphorylation was required in the development of allergen-
induced airway hyperresponsiveness.
The acute ovalbumin-sensitization model used here is associated
with an inflammatory response, as indicated by changes in cytokine
levels and infiltration of immune cells into the lung. Analysis of cell
infiltration by assessing total cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage
(BAL) determined that the accumulation of inflammatory cells
into the lung following ovalbumin sensitization and ovalbumin
challenge was not significantly different between WT and M3-KI
mice (Fig. S5A). Analysis of different inflammatory cell types in the
BAL was carried out. Whereas the macrophage levels (Fig. S5B)
were not seen to change following ovalbumin sensitization/chal-
lenge of WT and M3-KI mice, the numbers of eosinophils (Fig.
S5C), neutrophils (Fig. S5D), and lymphocytes (Fig. S5E) were
significantly increased, by the same extent, in WT and M3-KI mice
sensitized with ovalbumin and challenged with ovalbumin.
Phosphorylation of the M3-mAChR Regulates Specific Physiological
Responses. We show here how the G protein-biased M3-mAChR
mutant receptor expressed in M3-KI mice can be used to define
the role of receptor phosphorylation-dependent signaling in
bronchial ASM. We reasoned that this approach could be ex-
tended to include other M3-mAChR–mediated responses and that
a map of the physiological responses that lay downstream of the
two fundamental signaling arms of the M3-mAChR, namely, G
protein-dependent and phosphorylation/arrestin-dependent sig-
naling, could be generated. To test this hypothesis, we compared
the M3-mAChR–mediated contraction of bronchial smooth
muscle with other M3-mAChR–mediated physiological re-
sponses, namely, salivary secretion and weight gain.
Previous gene KO studies established that salivary secretion in
response to low doses of the muscarinic partial agonist pilocarpine
was almost completely dependent on M3-mAChR (28). The results
of these studies were confirmed here, where salivary secretion in
response to pilocarpine was significantly reduced in M3-mAChR KO
mice (Fig. 5A). In contrast, salivary secretion in response to pilo-
carpine in M3-KI mice was significantly enhanced compared with
WT animals (Fig. 5A). These results indicated that in contrast to M3-
mAChR–mediated contraction of ASM, M3-mAChR–mediated
secretion of saliva was independent of receptor phosphorylation
signaling but was dependent on signaling through Gq pathways. The
slight increase in salivary secretion observed in M3-KI mice may
reflect the fact that phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms, which
are traditionally considered to desensitize G protein responses, are
not in operation in M3-KI mice.
M3-mAChR KO mice have also previously been reported to
show reduced food intake and decreased body fat (29). This
phenotype has been associated with the action of the M3-
mAChR on the hypothalamic leptin/melanocortin system (29).
In addition, the M3-mAChR KO mice showed an increase in
both resting and total energy expenditure (oxygen consumption)
as well as an increase in the rate of oxidation of fatty acids (30),

 phenotypes that have been linked with M3-mAChR regulation of
sympathetic flow (30). Disruption of both of these physiological
processes in M3-mAChR KO mice combines to generate an
overall lean phenotype, where the mice show reduced total body
weight (29, 31). We confirm these data here by demonstrating
that M3-mAChR KO mice have reduced body weight compared
with WT controls (Fig. 5 B and C). In contrast to the M3-
mAChR KO mice, M3-KI mice were slightly, but significantly,
heavier than the WT controls (Fig. 5 B and D). These data
suggest that M3-mAChR signaling via Gq protein is the primary
signaling pathway that regulates M3-mAChR metabolic and
feeding responses responsible for weight gain.
Combining these data with previously published results (Discus-
sion), a map of the physiological pathways downstream of phos-
phorylation/arrestin signaling and G protein-dependent signaling
can be generated (Fig. 5E). This map can be used to predict the
physiological/therapeutic outcome of biased M3-mAChR ligands
(Fig. 5F).
Discussion
Our study demonstrates a previously unidentified role for M3-
mAChR phosphorylation in the regulation of lung function and in
driving airway hyperresponsiveness, one of the key features of al-
lergic inflammatory airway disease. Our unique observation also
highlights the importance of receptor phosphorylation in mediating
M3-mAChR–induced ASM contraction via the activation of the
RhoA pathway.
Because previous studies had demonstrated a role for RhoA
signaling in calcium-independent ASM contraction (3–5), we used
a genetically engineered mouse that expresses a phosphorylation-
deficient variant of the M3-mAChR (M3-KI) to investigate the
possibility that phosphorylation of the M3-mAChR was involved in
coupling the receptor to RhoA signaling and, through this mecha-
nism, to ASM contraction. That phosphorylation of the M3-
mAChR plays a role in coupling to RhoA was indicated by (i) data
showing that pharmacological inhibition of Rho-kinase in WT PCLS
phenocopied the reduced airway contraction response observed in
PCLS from M3-KI mice, (ii) that the phosphodeficient M3-mAChR
showed markedly reduced coupling to RhoA, and (iii) that phos-
phorylation of MLC was significantly reduced in ASM of M3-KI
mice. In addition, we used the recently characterized Gq inhibitor
FR900359 (22) to demonstrate that M3-mAChR–induced calcium
mobilization was inhibited by FR900359, whereas M3-induced airway
contraction was not. Because our experimental design measured the
overall calcium changes in whole PCLS, we cannot completely exclude
a role of compartmentalized changes in Gq-driven calcium signals in
ASM in the regulation of airway contraction, as shown by others (32,
33). Nonetheless, our data are consistent with a recent report dem-
onstrating that muscarinic-mediated contractile responses in human
PCLS were less sensitive to FR900359, and therefore less dependent
on calcium, than contraction mediated by histamine receptors (34).
Furthermore, knocking down β-arrestin-1 has recently been shown to
impair muscarinic-mediated bronchoconstriction (33), demonstrating
the complexity surrounding the procontractile pathways coupled to
M3-mAChRs in ASM. These studies, coupled with our data, support
the hypothesis that M3-mAChR phosphorylation mediates activation
of RhoA signaling (possibly by arrestin recruitment) that results in
increased MLC phosphorylation and ASM contraction. This phos-
phorylation-dependent calcium sensitization process plays a prom-
inent role in M3-mAChR–dependent ASM contraction, with a minor
role played by calcium transient-dependent processes.
It is known that vagally derived ACh limits airflow by broncho-
constriction mediated by the activation of the M3-mAChR on ASM

 (1). If the role for M3-mAChR phosphorylation in ASM contraction
identified here is of physiological relevance, then it might be expected
that the lung function of M3-KI mice would be different from the
lung function of WT mice. We found (by assessing lung resistance)
that airway obstruction in response to ACh was significantly reduced
in M3-KI mice compared with WT mice, an observation consistent
with the notion that the phosphorylation status of the M3-mAChR is
important in regulating baseline cholinergic ASM tone. This obser-
vation is in line with studies conducted in healthy volunteers showing
a significant improvement in lung function by anticholinergic drugs
(2). Furthermore, in an acute murine model of allergic inflammatory
airway disease, which mimics several of the central hallmarks of
human bronchial asthma (35), including airway hyperresponsiveness
and immune cell lung infiltration, we show that the development of
allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness to ACh was dependent
on M3-mAChR phosphorylation-dependent pathways because sen-
sitized M3-KI mice failed to demonstrate the typically enhanced
airway hyperresponsiveness. Thus, both normal and pathophysiolog-
ical lung function in M3-KI mice was significantly different from WT
mice, indicating an important role for M3-mAChR phosphorylation
in the regulation of airway narrowing in health and disease states.
The mechanisms by which allergen-exposed M3-KI mice were
protected against the development of abnormal bronchial respon-
siveness appeared to be unrelated to the number of inflammatory
cells (eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils) recruited within
the airways. This dissociation between airway inflammation and the
degree of airway hyperresponsiveness has been previously reported
in various studies, including observations in asthmatic patients (36)
as well as in animal models of allergic inflammatory airway disease
(34, 37, 38). Rather, we propose that in the lung, phosphorylation
of the M3-mAChR is important in driving key asthmatic features,
such as airway hyperresponsiveness, in part, via M3-mAChR
phosphorylation and RhoA-dependent signaling.
Because our M3-KI mouse line expressing G protein-biased M3-
mAChR mutant defined a previously unidentified role for M3-
mAChR phosphorylation-dependent signaling in ASM contraction,
we reasoned that this mouse line could be used to investigate other
M3-mAChR–mediated physiological responses and establish whether
these responses were dependent on G protein- or receptor phos-
phorylation/arrestin-dependent signaling. We therefore ex-
amined M3-mAChR–mediated salivary secretion and weight gain
and established that both of these responses were slightly up-reg-
ulated in M3-KI mice, indicating that they were not dependent on
receptor phosphorylation/arrestin signaling, but more likely de-
pendent on G protein coupling. The loss of the phosphorylation-
dependent desensitization of G protein-mediated signaling may

Lung function and airway hyperresponsiveness are regulated by M3-
mAChR phosphorylation/arrestin signaling. (A) Lung resistance (RL) was mea-
sured in WT and M3-KI mice at various ACh concentrations. Data represent the
mean ± SEM (WT, n = 10; M3-KI, n = 13). (B) −LogPC100 was determined for WT
and M3-KI mice. Data presented in A and B are the mean ± SEM (WT, n = 10;
M3-KI, n = 13). Data were analyzed using Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney
tests (WT vs. M3-KI: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001). (C) Airway hyper-
responsiveness was induced using ovalbumin sensitization followed by oval-
bumin challenge in WT and M3-KI mice. Controls were ovalbumin sensitization
followed by saline challenge. RL was determined at various ACh concentrations.
Data represent the mean ± SEM (WT, n = 6; M3-KI, n = 6). Data were analyzed
using Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney tests (WT saline vs. WT ovalbumin:
*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01 and WT ovalbumin vs. M3-KI ovalbumin: #P < 0.05;
##P < 0.01). (D) −LogPC100 was determined for WT and M3-KI mice sensitized
with ovalbumin and challenged with either control saline or ovalbumin.
Data present the mean ± SEM (WT, n = 6, M3-KI, n = 6). Data were analyzed
using Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney tests (WT saline vs. WT ovalbumin:

mice. (B) Representative images of M3-KI, M3-KO, and WT mice demonstrating

to 11 mice and were analyzed using two-way ANOVA (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01;
****P < 0.0001). (E) Illustration of the physiologically relevant signaling path-
ways downstream of the M3-mAChR. Some of the pathways activated by the
M3-mAChR in heterologous systems are illustrated (i.e., PLC, ERK, PKD, JNK, PI3-
K, Src, RhoA, PLA2, and p53). P13-K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PKD, protein
kinase D; PLA2, phospholipase A2; PLC, phospholipase C. In this study, we used a
mutant mouse strain (M3-KI) expressing a G protein-biased variant of the M3-
mAChR to assign those physiological responses that were downstream of either
G protein signaling (green arrows) or receptor phosphorylation and arrestin
signaling (orange arrows). (F) Such a map also allows for the rational design of
biased ligands because our studies present a model by which the physiological/
therapeutic outcome of biased ligands can be predicted. Thus, for the M3-
mAChR, a ligand that is biased toward receptor phosphorylation and arrestin
signaling would preferentially affect insulin release, learning and memory, and
bronchial contraction (orange arrows), although having potentially little impact
on weight gain, salivary secretion, and cell death pathways (gray arrows).

 be responsible for the modest but significant increase in weight and
salivary secretion observed in M3-KI mice.
These physiological responses could be added to our previous
studies demonstrating a predominant role for M3-mAChR
phosphorylation/arrestin coupling in the regulation of insulin
secretion (14) and learning and memory (15), as well as in G
protein coupling in M3-mAChR regulation of p53 subcellular
localization and apoptosis (39, 40). By combining all these
studies, we have generated a map of the physiological responses
mediated by the M3-mAChR through either G protein- or re-
ceptor phosphorylation/arrestin-dependent signaling (Fig. 5E).
This map has allowed us, for the first time to our knowledge, to
make a prediction of the likely physiological outcomes of a biased
GPCR ligand. Thus, an M3-mAChR drug-like ligand showing
stimulus bias toward receptor phosphorylation and arrestin sig-
naling would preferentially engage physiological signaling pathways
that would promote changes in insulin secretion, have an impact on
learning and memory, and regulate bronchoconstriction (Fig. 5F).
This same ligand would not be expected to have a substantial im-
pact on salivary secretion, weight gain, and mechanisms associated
with cell survival (Fig. 5F). This analysis has considerable potential
application in drug discovery, where biased ligands can be designed
to direct signaling toward those pathways that result in clinical ef-
ficacy and away from pathways that lead to adverse/toxic outcomes.
Hence, by using a genetically modified mouse expressing a G pro-
tein-biased receptor, we are not only able to define the physiolog-
ically relevant signaling pathways acting downstream of a particular
GPCR (in this case, the M3-mAChR) but also to determine what
type of signaling bias to design into ligands targeting that receptor
to promote a particular physiological/therapeutic outcome.
