Abstract
Background and objectives There are inconsistent reports on the association of dietary protein intake with serum
albumin and outcomes among patients on hemodialysis. Using a new normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR)
variable accounting forresidual renalurea clearance, we hypothesized that higher baseline nPCR andriseinnPCR
would be associated with higher serum albumin and better survival among incident hemodialysis patients.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements Among 36,757 incident hemodialysis patients in a large United
States dialysis organization, we examined baseline and change in renal urea clearance–corrected nPCR as a protein
intake surrogate and modeled their associations with serum albumin and mortality over 5 years (1/2007–12/2011).
Results Median nPCRs with and without accounting for renal urea clearance at baseline were 0.94 and 0.78 g/kg
per day, respectively (median within-patient difference, 0.14 [interquartile range, 0.07–0.23] g/kg per day).
Duringamedianfollow-upperiodof1.4years,8481deathswereobserved.Baselinerenalureaclearance–corrected
nPCR was associated with higher serum albumin and lower mortality in the fully adjusted model (Ptrend,0.001).
Among 13,895 patients with available data, greater rise in renal urea clearance–corrected nPCR during the first 6
months was also associated with attaining high serum albumin ($3.8 g/dl) and lower mortality (Ptrend,0.001);
compared with the reference group (a change of 0.1–0.2 g/kg per day), odds and hazard ratios were 0.53 (95%
confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.63) and 1.32 (95% confidence interval, 1.14 to 1.54), respectively, among patients
with a change of ,20.2 g/kg per day and 1.62 (95% confidence interval, 1.35 to 1.96) and 0.76 (95% confidence
interval, 0.64 to 0.90), respectively, among those with a change of $0.5 g/kg per day. Within a given category of
nPCR without accounting for renal urea clearance, higher levels of renal urea clearance–corrected nPCR
consistently showed lower mortality risk.

Introduction
Protein-energy wasting (PEW), manifested by inade-
quate dietary protein intake or low serum albumin,
is a common condition and a predictor of mortality in
patients on dialysis (1–4). PEW is characterized by
simultaneous loss of body protein and energy stores
among patients with advanced CKD (5–7). Among
patients on dialysis, the protein requirement is higher
than in healthy adults because of the removal of
amino acid by the dialysis treatment and the protein
catabolic or antianabolic state caused by the uremia,
inflammation, oxidative stress, and exposure to bio-
incompatible dialysis materials (8). The National
Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality
Initiative (KDOQI) clinical practice guidelines
recommend a dietary protein intake of 1.2 g protein
per 1 kg of ideal body wt per day for patients on
maintenance hemodialysis (9). However, the role of
dietary protein intake on serum albumin levels re-
mains controversial on the basis of current published
data mostly from cross-sectional studies (10,11).
The urea kinetic–based protein catabolic rate, which
is usually normalized for body weight (normalized
protein catabolic rate [nPCR]), is often interpreted
as a measure of dietary protein intake. During steady-
state conditions, protein intake is equal to or slightly
greater than nPCR (9). Although serum albumin is a
strong predictor of mortality among incident and

 prevalent hemodialysis patients (2,12,13), the mortality
predictability of nPCR in patients on hemodialysis remains
controversial. A previous study of patients on hemodialysis
showed that there was no association between mortality and
either baseline or 6-month follow-up measurements of nPCR
(14), whereas other studies have shown an increased risk of
death among patients with low levels or decreasing trend in
nPCR (15–18).
These inconsistent results may be partly due to the fact
that previous studies calculated nPCR without account-
ing for the contribution of residual renal urea clearance
(rCLurea) (19,20). In addition, most studies evaluated the
association between nPCR and serum albumin in a cross-
sectional manner. We, therefore, hypothesized that nPCR
accounting for rCLurea (i.e., rCLurea-corrected nPCR) pro-
vides better mortality risk stratification among incident
hemodialysis patients while retaining its association with
better survival and that a rise in nPCR, not baseline nPCR,
is associated with attaining higher serum albumin.
Materials and Methods
Patients
We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from all inci-
dent in-center hemodialysis patients ages $18 years old
treated in facilities operated by a large United States dial-
ysis organization from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011
(21). Patient follow-up was divided into 20 consecutive
patient-quarters representing 91-day intervals from the start
of dialysis. Among 208,820 incident dialysis patients, we
identified 133,134 patients who were treated only with
conventional hemodialysis. We excluded patients with miss-
ing data on serum albumin, single-pool Kt/V (spKt/V), and
rCLurea at baseline and those with multiple measurements of
BUN on the same day, resulting in a cohort of 36,757 patients
for evaluation of the association between baseline nPCR
and mortality (Supplemental Figure 1). Differences in base-
line characteristics among included versus excluded patients
are shown in Supplemental Table 1. We further restricted
to 13,895 patients with available data on serum albumin,
spKt/V, and rCLurea at the third patient-quarter to evaluate
the association of change in nPCR during the first 6 months
of dialysis (i.e., from the first quarter to the third quarter) with
attained serum albumin $3.8 g/dl and mortality risk.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Com-
mittees of the University of California, Irvine and Los
Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor–University
of California, Los Angeles, with the exemption of obtaining
written consent given the large sample size, anonymity of
the patients studied, and nonintrusive nature of the research.
Demographic, Clinical, and Laboratory Measures
Information on demographics, cause of ESRD, access
type, presence of comorbidities, and death was obtained
from the large dialysis organization’s database. Most blood
samples were collected before dialysis. Dialysis dose was
estimated by spKt/V using the urea kinetic model. Serum
albumin was assayed using the bromocresol green method
throughout the study period. The average serum urea
concentrations during the urine collections were assumed
to be 90% of the predialysis concentrations according to the
approach by Daugirdas (22), and rCLurea was calculated as
described with adjustment for body surface area (23,24) as
presented in Supplemental Material. As an indicator of
daily protein intake, nPCR was calculated accounting for
rCLurea (i.e., rCLurea-corrected nPCR) and expressed as
nPCRdial+renal. In contrast, nPCR calculated without account-
ing for rCLurea (i.e., non-rCLurea–corrected nPCR), as com-
monly used in current clinical practice, is expressed as
nPCRdial. To account for varying frequencies of dialysis
treatments per week (two versus three times), the correction
component for the predialysis BUN (C0) for nPCRdial+renal
and nPCRdial equations is used as shown in Supplemental
Material. To minimize measurement variability, all repeated
measures for each patient during any given patient-quarter
were averaged. The averaged values during the first patient-
quarter were used as baseline data.
Statistical Analyses
To examine differences between nPCRdial and nPCRdial+renal
levels, we used the Bland–Altman plot and summarized the
differences by rCLurea strata (,1.5, 1.5 to ,3.0, 3.0 to ,4.5,
and $4.5 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Baseline characteristics
between the high and low baseline nPCRdial+renal groups
(,1.2 and $1.2 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively) were
summarized as proportions, means (6SD), or medians
(interquartile ranges [IQRs]). Given the relatively large
sample size of this study, baseline characteristics were
compared by standardized differences, of which 0.2, 0.5,
and 0.8 were considered small, medium, and large differ-
ences, respectively, and $0.1 was defined as a meaningful
imbalance (25). Ten categories of baseline nPCRdial+renal
were created: ,0.6 and $1.4 g/kg per day and eight
incremental categories of 0.1 g/kg per day in between.
Likewise, change in nPCRdial+renal from the first quarter to
the third quarter of dialysis was calculated, and nine
categories were created as follows: ,20.2 and $0.5 g/kg
per day and seven incremental categories of 0.1 g/kg per
day in between.
Logistic regression models were used to estimate asso-
ciations between baseline nPCRdial+renal and having base-
line serum albumin $3.8 g/dl and between change in
nPCRdial+renal and attained serum albumin $3.8 g/dl at the
third patient-quarter. The Cox proportional hazards model
was used to estimate the associations between the exposure
categories and all-cause mortality. The hazard proportion-
ality was confirmed by the Schoenfeld residuals plot. Both
baseline nPCRdial+renal and change in nPCRdial+renal were
also modeled as continuous variables, and their relationship
with outcomes (mortality or attained serum albumin level
$3.8 g/dl at the third patient-quarter) was estimated using
restricted cubic spline functions with four knots at the fifth,
35th, 65th, and 95th percentiles of each index and referent at
the median of nPCRdial+renal. For each analysis, associations
were adjusted by using three levels of hierarchical models:
(1) unadjusted model; (2) case mix–adjusted models that
included age, sex, race/ethnicity, diabetes mellitus, vascular
access type, spKt/V, and rCLurea at baseline as well as the nine
preexisting comorbidities listed in Table 1; and (3) case mix–
and malnutrition-inflammation cachexia syndrome (MICS)–
adjusted models that included all above-mentioned covariates
plus surrogates of nutritional and inflammatory status, in-
cluding body mass index and 11 laboratory variables listed in
Table 1. For models evaluating changes in nPCR, adjustment

 for baseline nPCR was added to all models. Missing data in
covariates (,1% for most laboratory variables and 4% for
serum creatinine) were imputed by the mean or median of the
existing values as appropriate. All analyses were carried
out using STATA MP, version 13.1 (StataCorp, College
Station, TX).

 Results
Differences between Baseline nPCR Values with and without
Accounting for rCLurea
Median values (IQR) of nPCRdial and nPCRdial+renal at
baseline were 0.78 (0.65–0.94) and 0.94 (0.77–1.14) g/kg per
day, respectively. The median (IQR) difference between
these two indices was 0.14 (0.07–0.23) g/kg per day. There
was a trend toward larger differences between these two
indices across higher averaged values of nPCRdial and
nPCRdial+renal (Figure 1A). Patients with greater rCLurea
had higher nPCRdial+renal; among patients with rCLurea,1.5,
1.5 to ,3.0, 3.0 to ,4.5, and $4.5 ml/min per 1.73 m2,
nPCRdial+renal showed consistently higher values with
median (IQR) values of 0.81 (0.67–0.98), 0.91 (0.76–1.08),
0.98 (0.82–1.16), and 1.07 (0.89–1.28), respectively, while
median (IQR) values of nPCRdial were 0.77 (0.64–0.93),
0.79 (0.66–0.94), 0.80 (0.67–0.94), and 0.78 (0.65–0.94) g/kg
per day, respectively. Differences between nPCRdial and
nPCRdial+renal were significantly larger across higher rCLurea
categories: 0.04 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.01 to
0.06), 0.11 (95% CI, 0.09 to 0.14), 0.18 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.22),
and 0.28 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.36) g/kg per day, respectively
(Pinteraction,0.001) (Figure 1B).
Baseline Demographic, Clinical, and Laboratory
Characteristics according to Baseline
rCLurea-Corrected nPCR
Among 36,757 patients, the mean6SD age was 62615
years old, 37% were women, 54% were non-Hispanic
white, 28% were black, and 47% had diabetes as the cause
of ESRD (Table 1). Patients were dichotomized on the basis
of baseline nPCRdial+renal ,1.2 g/kg per day (n=29,685;
81%) versus $1.2 g/kg per day (n=7072; 19%). The latter
nPCR range is the recommended target range set forth by
the KDOQI clinical practice guidelines (8). Compared with
patients with nPCRdial+renal,1.2 g/kg per day at baseline,
those who had greater nPCRdial+renal ($1.2 g/kg per day)
were more likely to be men and Hispanic or Asian and less
likely to be black; were more likely to use arteriovenous fis-
tula; had higher spKt/V, rCLurea, hemoglobin, albumin, phos-
phorus, creatinine, and total iron binding capacity; and had
lower serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and bicarbonate.

 Association of Baseline rCLurea-Corrected nPCR with Serum
Albumin Levels and All-Cause Mortality
A total of 8481 deaths were observed during the follow-
up period (up to 5 years; median [IQR] =1.4 [0.7–2.5] years),
with a mortality rate of 13.5/100 patient-yr. There was an
unadjusted trend toward higher baseline serum albumin
across higher baseline nPCRdial+renal categories (Table 2),
which were robust against adjustments (Ptrend,0.001 for all
models) (Figure 2A, Supplemental Table 2). Additionally,
there was a consistent trend toward lower mortality risk
across higher nPCRdial+renal irrespective of adjustment
model, albeit with an attenuation in the fully adjusted
model (Ptrend,0.001 for all models) (Table 2, Figure 2C,
Supplemental Table 3). Compared with the reference group
(0.8–0.9 g/kg per day), baseline nPCRdial+renal ,0.7 g/kg
per day was significantly associated with higher mortality;
fully adjusted hazard ratio (HRs) were 1.25 (95% CI, 1.14 to
1.37) and 1.14 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.24) for nPCRdial+renal,0.6
and 0.6 to ,0.7 g/kg per day, respectively. Patients with
nPCRdial+renal$1.1 g/kg per day had a lower mortality risk
compared with the referent: fully adjusted HRs, 0.89
(95% CI, 0.81 to 0.98), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.90), 0.79
(95% CI, 0.69 to 0.89), and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.92) for
nPCRdial+renal=1.1–1.2, 1.2–1.3, 1.3–1.4, and $1.4 g/kg per day,
respectively. Consistent results were observed in the models
using restricted cubic spline functions (Figure 2B and D).
Association of Change in rCLurea-Corrected nPCR with
Serum Albumin Level and All-Cause Mortality
Among 13,895 patients, patients with a greater rise in
nPCRdial+renal had lower baseline nPCRdial+renal and serum
albumin (Table 3). There was a consistent trend toward
higher likelihood of having serum albumin $3.8 g/dl at the
third patient-quarter across greater rise in nPCRdial+renal
categories, irrespective of adjustment model and without
attenuation (Ptrend,0.001 for all models) (Figure 3A,
Figure 2. | Higher baseline renal urea clearance-corrected normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCRdial+renal) levels were associated with
higher likelihood of having baseline serum albumin (Alb) ‡3.8 g/dl and lower mortality among 36,757 incident hemodialysis patients.

 Supplemental Table 4). Consistent results were also ob-
served in models using restricted cubic spline functions
(Figure 3B). Similarly, greater rise in nPCRdial+renal was also
associated with higher likelihood of an increase in serum
albumin $0.2 g/dl per 6 months (Supplemental Figure 2).
Among 13,895 patients with available data on change in
nPCRdial+renal, 2877 patients died during the follow-up
period (up to 4.5 years; median [IQR] =1.5 [0.8–2.4] years).
Greater rise in nPCRdial+renal categories had lower over-
all crude rates of all-cause death, despite lower baseline
nPCRdial+renal and serum albumin (Ptrend,0.001) (Table 3).
There was an inverse linear relationship between change
in nPCRdial+renal and mortality risk (Ptrend,0.001 for all
models) (Figure 3C, Supplemental Table 5). Compared
with the reference group (a rise of 0.1–0.2 g/kg per day
between the first and third patient-quarters), a decline in
nPCRdial+renal$0.1 g/kg per day was significantly associ-
ated with higher mortality risk: HR, 1.32 (95% CI, 1.14 to
1.54) and HR, 1.22 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.42) for decrease in
nPCRdial+renal.0.2 and .0.1–0.2 g/kg per day, respec-
tively. However, a rise in nPCRdial+renal$0.4 g/kg per day
showed a lower mortality risk in fully adjusted models:
HR, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.97) and HR, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.64 to
0.90) for rise in nPCRdial+renal=0.4–0.5 and .0.5 g/kg per
day, respectively. Consistent results were also observed in
models using restricted cubic splines (Figure 3D).
Mortality Risk Associated with Discordance between nPCR
Values with versus without Accounting for rCLurea
To examine the mortality risk associated with discor-
dance between nPCR values with versus without account-
ing for rCLurea, we conducted a Cox regression analysis
with case-mix adjustment after categorizing patients ac-
cording to nPCRdial+renal and nPCRdial values (i.e., ,0.8,
0.8 to ,1.0, 1.0 to ,1.2, and $1.2 g/kg per day). For
example, among 10,827 patients who were categorized
as having nPCRdial levels of 0.8 to ,1.0 g/kg per day,
there were 3659 (34%) who were concordantly catego-
rized as having nPCRdial+renal levels of 0.8 to ,1.0 g/kg
per day (Figure 4A). There was an incrementally lower
risk of all-cause death across increasing nPCRdial+renal
categories
within
each
category
of
nPCRdial
(Ptrend,0.001) (Figure 4B). However, this relationship
did not persist on examination from the opposite axis. Among
patients who were categorized as having nPCRdial+renal levels of
0.8 to ,1.0 g/kg per day, the adjusted mortality risk was
paradoxically higher in greater nPCRdial values (i.e., HR, 1.13
[95% CI, 1.00 to 1.27] in ,0.8 g/kg per day versus HR, 1.21 [95%
CI, 1.07 to 1.37] in 0.8 to ,1.0 g/kg per day; P=0.04).
Furthermore, there were no significant trends observed across
categories of nPCRdial within the other nPCRdial+renal
categories (Ptrend=0.73 in 1.0 to ,1.2 g/kg per day and
Ptrend=0.46 in $1.2 g/kg per day).
Discussion
In this longitudinal and national cohort of over 36,000
incident hemodialysis patients with documented data on
residual kidney function, we found that nPCR without
accounting for rCLurea tended to underestimate nPCR
values, especially among patients with greater rCLurea.
We also showed that baseline nPCRdial+renal (i.e., rCLurea-
corrected nPCR) was inversely associated with mortality.
Additionally, change in nPCRdial+renal during the first 6
months of hemodialysis was a significant correlate of at-
taining high serum albumin and mortality risk indepen-
dent of baseline nPCRdial+renal and other MICS markers.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the
association of nPCR with serum albumin levels and mor-
tality accounting for the contribution of rCLurea.
In current clinical practice, nPCR is calculated without
accounting for rCLurea, resulting in the underestimation of
total urea excretion from the body among patients with
residual kidney function. One previous study showed that
there was no association of nPCR at either baseline or 6
months follow-up with mortality outcomes (14). However,
it was acknowledged in this study that there may be bias
toward the null due to lack of uniformity of the postdialysis
blood flow for BUN measurement, which may have
affected the precision of nPCR values (14). Given the large
error in calculation of nPCR and the strong association with
patient health-related quality of life and clinical outcomes,
we believe that rCLurea should be periodically monitored
and accounted for when evaluating protein intake using
nPCR among patients with residual kidney function.
Our study showed a clear inverse linear trend toward
lower mortality across higher nPCRdial+renal, whereas

 previous studies have shown a reverse J-shaped associa-
tion, where patients with nPCRdial$1.4 g/kg per day
had a higher mortality risk (16,17). The association between
nPCRdial+renal and mortality in our study was robust, even
after rigorous adjustment for case mix variables and MICS
markers. The difference in results between our study and
the previous studies is likely attributed to the difference
between nPCRdial and nPCRdial+renal; the differences be-
tween these two variables are especially greater among
patients with higher nPCR levels (Figure 1). In our study,
there also seemed to be an incrementally higher mortality
risk associated with lower nPCRdial+renal levels within the
same nPCRdial category, suggesting that a better risk
stratification of all-cause mortality attributed to nPCR
accounting for rCLurea. The paradoxically lower mortality
risk associated with lower nPCRdial among patients who
were categorized as having low nPCRdial+renal (i.e., 0.8–
,1.0 g/kg per day) may be due to residual kidney function,
a strong predictor of better survival among patients on
hemodialysis (19,20).
Higher rise in nPCRdial+renal was a correlate of attaining
higher serum albumin at the third patient-quarter, despite
lower baseline nPCRdial+renal and serum albumin. Inflamma-
tion decreases serum albumin levels by reducing the rate of
synthesis via downregulation of albumin gene transcription
(26–29). Malnutrition and inflammation are closely related to
each other and orchestrate the development of PEW (3,5), and
recent randomized clinical trials showed that protein supple-
mentation reduced inflammation and increased serum albu-
min levels (30,31). Moreover, higher rise in nPCRdial+renal
predicted lower mortality. These associations between baseline
or change in nPCRdial+renal and mortality seemed to be
attenuated in the fully adjusted model, but it is likely due
to overadjustment for MICS markers, which also included

 serum albumin and other potential intermediate factors in the
causal pathway between dietary protein intake and survival.
Rise in nPCR over the first 6 months of dialysis may be one of
the representations of increased appetite and intake in relation
to the resolution of uremic symptoms (32). Nevertheless,
baseline or change in nPCRdial+renal was independently asso-
ciated with all-cause death even after adjustment for MICS-
related variables. Therefore, nPCR may be a useful predictor of
mortality in patients on hemodialysis among others (3,33) as
included in composite nutritional scores (34,35).
Several limitations of our study should be noted. First, there
are day-to-day fluctuations in nPCR caused by changes in
daily protein intake (36). However, the use of nPCR data that
were averaged over a treatment quarter might mitigate the
effect of these fluctuations on our examined associations.
Second, the use of nPCR as a reflection of daily protein intake
assumes that protein metabolism is in equilibrium at the time
of measurement (37). This is not always the case with patients
on hemodialysis, because they are susceptible to various
comorbidities, which may induce protein catabolism. Addi-
tionally, information about rCLurea was not available for all
patients. Therefore, our results may not be representative of
the entire cohort and may be subject to selection biases. As
shown in Supplemental Table 1, patients with available rCLurea
were more likely to be non-Hispanic white and had higher
spKt/V, albumin, and body mass index. However, adding
rCLurea data to the calculation of nPCR may have provided a
more accurate approach in evaluating nPCR. Although we
adjusted for a number of inflammatory markers, such as
serum ferritin, total iron binding capacity, blood white blood
cells, and lymphocyte percentage (38–40), other inflammatory
markers, such as C-reactive protein, were not available.
In conclusion, our study shows that both higher baseline
values and greater increase in dietary protein intake, represen-
ted by rCLurea-corrected nPCR, are independently associated
with attaining higher serum albumin levels and lower all-cause
mortality among incident hemodialysis patients. Compared
with conventional nPCR, rCLurea-corrected nPCR may be a
better marker of mortality among patients on hemodialysis with
substantial residual kidney function. Future studies should
investigate effective nutrition treatments in patients on hemo-
dialysis and their effects on clinical outcomes.
