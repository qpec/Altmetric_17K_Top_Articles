The maintenance of pregnancy relies on finely tuned immune adaptations. We demonstrate that these adaptations are
precisely timed, reflecting an immune clock of pregnancy in women delivering at term. Using mass cytometry, the
abundance and functional responses of all major immune cell subsets were quantified inserial blood samples collected
throughout pregnancy. Cell signaling–based Elastic Net, a regularized regression method adapted from the elastic net
algorithm, was developed to infer and prospectively validate a predictive model of interrelated immune events that
accurately captures the chronology of pregnancy. Model components highlighted existing knowledge and revealed
previously unreported biology, including a critical role for the interleukin-2–dependent STAT5ab signaling pathway in
modulating T cell function during pregnancy. These findings unravel the precise timing of immunological events
occurring during a term pregnancy and provide the analytical framework to identify immunological deviations
implicated in pregnancy-related pathologies.
INTRODUCTION
During pregnancy, the maternal immune system must engage in a fine
balancing act: maintaining tolerance to the fetal allograft while preserv-
ing innate and adaptive immune mechanisms for protection against
microbial challenges (1, 2). The dysregulation of immunological mech-
anisms normally engaged in the maintenance of a term pregnancy is
increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of preterm birth and other
pregnancy-related complications (2–4). The capacity to capture such
dysregulation during the course of pregnancy in an accessible body
compartment (such as peripheral blood) is of high clinical importance,
because it will enable risk prediction and alleviation. A critical question
is whether a chronology of precisely timed immune adaptations, evoc-
ative of an “immune clock,” can be tracked in peripheral blood during
term pregnancy. Demonstrating that an immune clock characterizes
term pregnancy is a key premise to search for chronological deviations
associated with pathologies of gestation such as preterm birth.
Elucidating the feto-maternal immunological cross-talk implicated
in the maintenance of a term pregnancy has been the subject of substan-
tial interest. Animal and human studies investigating the role of the
feto-maternal interface have been particularly useful in revealing the lo-
cal cellular mechanisms that control maternal immune tolerance to the
semi-allogeneic fetus (1, 2, 4, 5). In contrast, fewer efforts have focused
on the systemic immune adaptations to pregnancy. Seminal studies
centered on plasma cytokine profiles and flow cytometry analyses of
isolated peripheral leukocytes have provided important clues to the
understanding of the peripheral immune response during pregnancy
(6–9). These studies are consistent with gestational age–dependent
and cell type–specific immune adaptations, which provide the mother
with effective protection from harmful pathogens while allowing for tol-
erance to fetal antigens (5, 10). For example, some aspects of adaptive
immunity are decreased during pregnancy, such as T cell and B cell fre-
quencies and the ability of naïve CD4+ T cells to produce T helper cell
1 (TH1)– and TH2-type cytokines. In contrast, specific innate immune
responses are exacerbated, such as natural killer (NK) cell, monocyte,
and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) cytokine responses when stimu-
lated with viral particles (8, 11). However, the limited information at the
cellular level afforded by proteomic analyses, the drawbacks of using
isolated cells removed from their natural multicellular milieu, and the
computational challenges presented by the statistical interpretation of
high-dimensional immune networks have thus far precluded the char-
acterization of the chronology underlying these immune system–wide
adaptations to pregnancy.
The recent “bedside” applications of high-content immune profiling
technologies, including mass cytometry, hold significant promise for
providing comprehensive insights into immunological processes impli-
cated in normal and pathological pregnancies (12, 13). Mass cytometry
is a single-cell analysis platform that enables the simultaneous interro-
gation of multiple signaling pathways in distinct cell subsets spanning
the entire immune system (14). The multiplex functional readout af-
forded by mass cytometry provides unprecedented opportunities to
describe the human immune system as a network of correlated, cell
type–specific attributes and to investigate the functional relationships
between cells within and across hematopoietic lineages (15, 16). How-
ever, as the number of measured parameters increases, the development
of appropriate computational methods that make optimal use of the
dimensionality and correlated nature of the data while avoiding “over-
fitting” has become paramount (17).

 Elastic Net (csEN) algorithm to infer a model of interrelated immune
features that accurately predicts the timing of immunological adapta-
tions over the entire course of a term pregnancy. Such a model can then
serve as a reference to detect immunological disruptions that may pre-
cede clinical manifestations of pregnancy-related pathologies. The csEN
algorithm was adapted from the Elastic Net (EN) regularized regression
method (18) and accounts for the influence of previous biological
knowledge of receptor-specific signal transduction on the generation
of single-cell mass cytometry data. Here, the immunological data set
comprised the phenotype and intracellular signaling activities of all
major innate and adaptive immune cells, which were simultaneously
quantified in serial whole-blood samples. Three sets of data were gen-
erated by quantifying the abundances of peripheral immune cell sub-
sets, capturing endogenous intracellular signaling activities, and
determining the capacity of immune cell subsets to respond to stimu-
lation with receptor-specific ligands.
RESULTS
Deep single-cell profiling of the systemic immune response
to pregnancy
Twenty-one pregnant women receiving routine antepartum care at
Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital were enrolled in the study. Patient
demographics, antepartum parameters, mode of delivery, and gesta-
tional age at delivery are listed in Table 1. The analysis was performed
on 18 patients who delivered at term (≥37 weeks of gestation). Three
women who delivered prematurely (<37 weeks of gestation) were ex-
cluded from the analysis. An independent cohort of 10 pregnant women
who delivered at term was subsequently enrolled to prospectively vali-
date study results.
Serial blood samples were collected at three time points during preg-
nancy (early-, mid-, and late-pregnancy time points) and at 6 weeks
postpartum (Fig. 1A). The approach leveraged the interindividual var-
iability in sample collection time to define a continuous variable (gesta-
tionalageattime ofsampling)distributedacrossthe course ofpregnancy.
Using a 41-parameter mass cytometry assay (table S1), a total of 984
immune features were extracted from each blood sample including
the frequencies of 24 immune cell subsets representing major innate
and adaptive compartments (fig. S1), their endogenous intracellular
signaling activities, and the capacities of each cell subset to respond to
a series of receptor-specific immune challenges [stimulation with lipo-
polysaccharide (LPS), interferon-a2A (IFN-a), and a cocktail of inter-
leukins (ILs) containing IL-2 and IL-6] (Fig. 1, B and C). Immune
features were derived from measurements performed in whole-blood
samples, which allowed the functional assessment of all peripheral im-
mune cell subsets while minimizing perturbations by experimental
processing.
An immune clock of pregnancy: csEN predicts the dynamic
changes of the maternal immune system over the course
of pregnancy
The mass cytometry data set formed a correlation network emphasizing
the interconnectivity of measured immune features (Fig. 2A and the
Supplementary Materials). The highly correlated nature of the mass cy-
tometry data suggested an EN method—a regularized regression
method particularly suitable to the analysis of intercorrelated data
(18)—as a primary candidate to determine whether dynamic changes
occurring in peripheral immune cells during pregnancy could predict
gestational age at time of sampling.
csEN, an extension of the existing EN algorithm, was developed to
account for the fact that previous biological knowledge of intracellular
signal transduction exerts an inherent influence on the generation of
mass cytometry data sets. In our study, ligands for ex vivo stimulation
were selected a priori to evoke cell-intrinsic and receptor-specific signal-
ing responses [e.g., Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4–dependent signaling for
LPS, Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription
(STAT) signaling for IFN-a, and JAK/STAT and mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) for the type I ILs IL-2 and IL-6]. Although these
stimulationsmayactivateimportantintracellularcross-talkandreceptor-
independent signaling responses, we hypothesized that emphasizing
canonical, receptor-specific signaling responses would improve the ro-
bustness of the analysis. We implemented a cell signaling–based matrix
constructed a priori that indicated for each cell subset whether a receptor-
specific signaling response to each stimulation condition is supported by
prior knowledge of intracellular signal transduction (Fig. 2B and table
S2). In analogy to L1 and L2 penalties of the EN algorithm, a third pen-
alty function was introduced that allowed, but did not force, prioritizing

 signaling responses included in the cell signaling–based matrix. The
magnitude of such penalization was agnostically and objectively
determined, resulting in a 5:1 prioritization of knowledge-based
signaling responses (see Materials and Methods).
The csEN algorithm identified a predictive model in the first cohort
of pregnant women that was strongly associated with gestational age at
the time of sampling (R = 0.89, P = 2.2 × 10−16; Fig. 2, C to E). The
validity of the EN model was prospectively tested in the mass cytometry
data from a cohort of 10 additional women. The EN model strongly
predicted gestational age at time of sampling in this independent cohort
(R = 0.62, P = 2.4 × 10−4; Fig. 2, F and G). Although the analysis only
considered data collected during pregnancy, applying the coefficients of
the csEN model to postpartum data allowed for comparison of the ma-
ternal immune state during and after pregnancy (Fig. 2, E and G). The
csEN model agnostically placed the postpartum state closest to the
earliest stage of pregnancy.
Together, the analysis identified a precisely timed chronology of in-
terrelated immune events that differed from a nonpregnant state and
progressed dynamically over the course of pregnancy. A side-by-side
comparison of the predictive power for estimating the gestational
age variable demonstrated that the csEN method significantly im-
proved the existingEN algorithm and outperformed algorithms repre-
senting the most common alternative predictive methods including
randomForest (19), k-nearest neighbors (20), Support Vector Machines
(21), and LASSO (Fig. 3, A and B) (22). In comparison with the less
predictive, non–signaling-based EN model, the csEN algorithm ex-
cluded 21 immune features by applying the signaling-based penaliza-
tion (table S3). These immune features were either (i) nonspecific
signaling responses to ex vivo stimulation with LPS in cell subsets for
which TLR4 expression is supported by little evidence [11 features, in-
cluding the STAT1/3/5 signaling responses in T cell subsets and the in-
hibitor of nuclear factor kB (IkB) response to LPS stimulation in pDC
andCD4+Tcells]or(ii)noncanonicalsignalingresponsestoIL-2/IL-6or
IFN-a stimulation [10 features, including extracellular signal–regulated
kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), riboprotein S6 (rpS6) andNF-kB phosphorylation
in response to IFN-a stimulation, and adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate
response element–binding protein (CREB), rpS6, and MAPK-activated
protein kinase 2 (MAPKPAK2) phosphorylation in response to IL-2/IL-6
stimulation].
csEN components are proxies that reveal broader cellular
programs of pregnancy-induced immune adaptations
The csEN algorithm provided a statistically robust predictive model by
attributing positive or negative coefficients to a set of nonredundant im-
mune features. Animportantsteptofurthercorroborate the csEN model
was the examination of its biological plausibility. Piecewise regression
analysis of csEN outputs containing immune features associated with
the highest coefficients revealed 25 particularly robust immune features
that were further explored (Fig. 3, C and D, and fig. S2).
An unsupervised clustering algorithm (k-means) segmented the cor-
relation network into 20 distinct communities (Fig. 4A and the Supple-
mentary Materials). Communities were described on the basis of the cell
types, stimulation condition, orfunctionalattributesthat appearedmost
frequently within each community (Fig. 4B). csEN components were
nested in different communities and pointed to closely interrelated
immune features behaving in synchrony over the course of pregnancy

Fig. 1. Experimental workflow and analytical approach. (A) Eighteen women who delivered at term gestation were initially studied. Ten additional women were
subsequently enrolled as a validation cohort. A whole-blood sample was obtained at three time points (early, mid, and late) during pregnancy and 6 weeks postpartum
(PP). (B) Aliquots were either left unstimulated (to quantify cell frequency and endogenous intracellular signaling activity) or stimulated with a panel of receptor-specific
ligands, including IFN-a, a cocktail of ILs containing IL-2 and IL-6 (IL), and LPS. Immune cells were stained with surface and intracellular antibodies and analyzed with
mass cytometry. (C) The assay produced three categories of immune features, providing information about cell frequencies (Fq) measured in 24 manually gated
immune cell subsets (purple bar), cell type–specific signaling capacity to respond to exogenous ligands (IFN-a, yellow bar; IL, red bar; LPS, green bar), and endogenous
signaling activity (blue bar). The number of immune features contained within each data category is indicated in parentheses. The analyses used the variability in
sample collection time to define a continuous variable (gestational age at time of sampling in weeks) distributed across the course of pregnancy (left, black circles).

 (Fig. 4C). Hence, csEN components can be viewed as statistically strin-
gent proxies that can provide further insight into pregnancy-related
immunological adaptations upon examination of their respective
communities. We examined the five communities (16, 2, 18, 14, and
7, highlighted in Fig. 4C) that contained the most informative model
components, as visualized by the largest (increasing strength of the
correlation with the gestational age variable) and darkest (increasing
absolute value of the csEN model coefficient) nodes on the graphical
representation of the csEN model (fig. S2 and table S4).
Community 7 contained the two most informative components of
the csEN model, “endogenous pSTAT5ab signal in naïve CD4+ T cells”
and “pSTAT5ab response to IL in neutrophils,” which were examined
separately. Immune features most strongly correlated to the csEN
component “endogenous pSTAT5ab signal in naïve CD4+ T cells” pri-
marily pointed to endogenous pSTAT5ab signaling activities in T cell
subsets. This community reflected important physiological cellular
adaptations of the JAK/STAT5ab signaling pathway over the course of
pregnancy. Comparedwiththe postpartum state, endogenousSTAT5ab
signaling progressively increased over the course of pregnancy across
several T cell subsets including memory CD4+, naive CD8+, memory
CD8+,Tcellreceptor(TCR)gd+T,andCD25+ForkheadboxP3(FoxP3)–
positive regulatory T cells (CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs; Fig. 4D and fig. S3A). In
contrast, the pSTAT5ab signal was not increased in innate immune cells
during pregnancy (fig. S3). Community 7 also anchored in the csEN
component“pSTAT5abresponsetoILinneutrophils,”whichwasstrong-
ly correlated to immune features pointing at the expansion of neutro-
phils and their global hypersensitization to multiple immunological
challenges during pregnancy including stimulation with IL-2 and IL-6,
LPS, and IFN-a (Fig. 4E and fig. S3B).
The next four communities that were highly informative to the csEN
model provided additional functional readouts for the capacity of spe-
cific immune cell subsets to respond to ex vivo stimulations during
pregnancy. Community 16, anchored in the csEN component “pSTAT1
response to IFN-a in CD16+CD56−NK cells,” was primarily populated
by immune features related to STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation in re-
sponse to IFN-a, an essential pathway fortype-I IFN signaltransduction
(23). Compared with the postpartum state, STAT1 signaling response to
IFN-a increased in CD16+CD56−NK cells over the course of pregnancy
(Fig. 4F). On further inspection, the analysis showed that multiple other
immune cell subsets in community 16 displayed a coordinate STAT1
signaling response to IFN-a stimulation, including classical monocyte
cells, myeloid DCs (mDCs), and CD8+ T cells (fig. S3C).
Community 2, anchored in the csEN component “pNF-kB response
to LPS in mDCs,” was populated with immune features that primarily

upon stimulation with LPS (Fig. 4G). More specifically, activation
(phosphorylation) of P38, MAPKAPK2, ERK1/2, rpS6, CREB, and
NF-kB by LPS was dampened in mDCs early in pregnancy compared
with the postpartum state. Consistent with these findings, the IkB signal
measured in LPS-stimulated mDCs decreased during pregnancy (fig.
S3D). These results are suggestive of a coordinated dampening of
TLR4 responses in mDCs in early pregnancy. These observations con-
trast with the increased TLR4 response in neutrophils during pregnancy
(Fig. 4E) and suggest that the modulation of the TLR4 pathway during
gestation is time-dependent and cell type–specific.

finding highlights the effect of basal signaling tone on the assessment of
immune cell responses to in vitro stimulations, which are quantified as
the difference in signaling activity between the stimulated and unstimu-
lated (basal) conditions. A similar effect was observed for features within
community 18, which correlated with the csEN component “pCREB
response to LPS in NK cells” (Fig. 4I). In this case, a higher basal pCREB
signal in NK cells primarily accounted for the decreased pCREB re-
sponse to LPS observed early in pregnancy (fig. S3F, black rectangles).
Intracellular pSTAT5ab signal provides an integrated
readout of T cell responses to the systemic environment
Endogenous STAT5ab signaling responses in community 7 were par-
ticularly interesting because they were anchored on the most informa-
tive csEN model component and reflected in vivo functional behaviors
of immune cell subsets throughout the course of pregnancy. These
signalingresponsesweresharedacrossmultipleTcellsubsets,whichsug-
gest that common upstream mechanisms may regulate the STAT5ab-
dependentactivityanddifferentiationofthesecelltypesduringpregnancy.
More than 20 cytokines and hormonal factors are known to activate
the transcription factors STAT5a and STAT5b (referred together as
STAT5ab) through cell type–specific combinations of receptor expres-
sion. STAT5ab was first described for its activation by prolactin (PRL)
(24), a lactogenic hormone that increases during pregnancy. Among its
many functions, PRL influences the proliferation and differentiation of
B cells and T cells (25). This raises the question of whether the shared

 integrated cellular readout of multiple hormonal or immunological
factors regulated by pregnancy.
To address this question, we quantified the plasma levels of 18 cir-
culating factors capable of activating the JAK/STAT5ab signaling
pathway in peripheral leukocytes at each time point during pregnancy.
The heat map in Fig. 5A depicts the correlation between these 18 factors
and endogenousSTAT5ab activitiescaptured in community 7. The data
visually emphasize stronger associations between JAK/STAT5ab activa-
tors and the pSTAT5ab signal in T cell subsets rather than innate or
B cells and indicate that multiple factors likely contribute to the shared
STAT5ab response in T cell subsets. Although endogenous STAT5ab
signaling in T cell subsets moderately correlated with PRL levels (R =
0.26, P = 0.016; Fig. 5B), correlations were stronger with immune
mediators such as IL-3 (Fig. 5C) and IL-2 (Fig. 5D). The strongest cor-
relation was observed between STAT5ab signaling in naïve CD4+ T cells
and IL-2 (R = 0.56, P = 5.4 × 10−6), a cytokine that is mainly produced
by activated T cells (26). Consistent with these findings, plasma IL-2
levels increased during pregnancy and were elevated at all trimesters
compared with the postpartum levels (Fig. 5E). Together with findings
from the csEN analysis, these results suggest a critical role for IL-2–
dependent STAT5ab signaling pathways in modulating T cell function
during pregnancy.
DISCUSSION
This study applied high-dimensional mass cytometry to characterize
with single-cell resolution the dynamic changes occurring in the mater-
nal peripheral immune system over the course of a term pregnancy. We
introduced a stringent analytical approach that takes advantage of the
interconnected nature of the single-cell immunological data set to infer,
as well as independently validate, a robust statistical model predicting
gestational age during pregnancy. The model provided a set of biolog-
ically compelling immune features that captured the progression of the
maternal immune system during pregnancy. Hence, the system-wide
analysis of immune cell behaviors in peripheral blood revealed an im-
mune clock of term pregnancy, a critical premise to detect chronological
deviations associated with pathological pregnancies, such as preterm
birth, in an accessible tissue compartment.

 Analysis of peripheral blood samples with mass cytometry produced
a highly correlated data set reflecting the modular biology of the im-
mune system in which multiple cell subsets act in concert (27). The re-
sulting high-content and interrelated data sets constitute an analytical
challenge. A modified and extended version of the EN algorithm was
implemented for the current analysis, which significantly increased the
predictive power of the derived and validated csEN model (Fig. 3). The
csEN algorithm allowed for an objective weighting of the observed
immunological data based on the previous knowledge of signaling
responses to receptor-specific ligands. In our data set, the csEN al-
gorithm outperformed other widely used predictive methods. Integrat-
ing known biology into an EN analysis is a powerful statistical approach
suitable for the analysis of highly modular data sets.
The high-content mass cytometry data set segregated into commu-
nities of correlated immune features that behaved in synchrony over the
course of pregnancy. The csEN model components nested in such com-
munities are statistically stringent immunological proxies that can
reveal the broader biological characteristics of their respective commu-
nities. For example, several csEN model components pointed at specific
signaling responses that were shared across multiple cell lineages, in-
cluding the increased endogenous STAT5ab activity among multiple
T cell subsets or the increased STAT1 signaling response to IFN-a ob-
served in a number of innate and adaptive immune cells. Alternatively,
other csEN components pointed at coordinated signaling events within
a specific immune cell subset (e.g., TLR4 signaling responses in mDCs).
Hence, the analysis revealed entire cellular programs, rather than
isolated mechanisms, that characterized the chronological progression
of immune adaptations over the entire course of pregnancy.
The csEN model identified several features that are in agreement
with previous work (5–8). With respect to innate cell function, our data
indicate an overall enhancement of innate immune responses during
pregnancy. Consistent with previous studies quantifying neutrophil
abundance and proinflammatory functions during pregnancy (6), our
findingssuggestthatthenumberofcirculatingneutrophilsincreaseddur-
ing pregnancy and that this abundance was correlated at the single-cell
level with the progressive enhancement of the responsiveness of neutro-
phils to a variety of stimuli (including LPS, IFN-a, and IL-2/IL-6; Fig. 4E).
Similarly,withintheNKcellcompartment, weobservedprogressive-
ly enhanced STAT1 signaling responses to stimulation with IFN-a, a
key mediator of defensive immunity against viral pathogens (Fig. 4F).
A gestational age–dependent increase in STAT1 response to IFN-a also
applied to several immune cell subsets including monocytes and mDCs.
This result is consistent with previous in vitro and in vivo studies, which
demonstrated that NK cell and monocyte responses to viral challenges
are enhanced during pregnancy (8, 11). Our data also suggested that
basal CREB signaling in peripheral NK cells (both CD56+CD16− and
CD56−CD16+ NK cell subsets) was increased early in pregnancy (Fig. 4I
and fig. S3F). CD56+CD16− NK cells are the most abundant immune
cells in the decidua during the first trimester of pregnancy, where they
are critical for the normal development of the placenta and the
establishment of feto-maternal tolerance (28, 29). Several hypotheses re-
garding the origin of decidual NK cells have been considered, including
the recruitment of mature peripheral CD56+CD16− NK cells, the differ-
entiation of peripheral CD16+ CD56− NK cells, and the differentiation
of progenitor cells within the decidua (30). Given the pivotal role for the
transcription factor CREB in immune cell survival, it is possible that the
increased basal CREB signaling tone observed early in pregnancy
confers a survival advantage on peripheral NK cells, allowing them to
contribute, as mature or precursor cells, to the pool of decidual NK cells.
In contrast to the STAT1 response to IFN-a observed in NK cells
and mDCs, TLR4 signaling responses to LPS in mDCs were dampened
early in pregnancy (Fig. 4G). TLR signaling can result in either pro-
inflammatory orimmunogenic versustolerogenicprograms,depending
on the biologic context (31). Although the function of DCs in maintain-
ing tolerance toward the fetus has been studied extensively at the feto-
maternal interface (1, 4), fewer studies have focused on peripheral
mDCs. Human peripheral mDCs express higher levels of tolerogenic
surface proteins (including PD-L1, B7-H4, CD200, and CD200R) dur-
ing the first trimester of pregnancy compared with the third trimester
(32). Whether observed TLR4 hyporesponsiveness of mDCs con-
tributes to peripheral tolerance toward fetal antigens early in pregnancy
requires further investigation.
Some of our findings differ from previous descriptions of immune
cell function during pregnancy. For example, Kraus et al. (6) reported
broadly diminished cytokine expression in naïve CD4+ T cells and
NK cells during pregnancy, whereas our data support an increased re-
sponsiveness of these cell types to certain extracellular ligands (e.g.,
STAT1 signaling responses to IFN-a). These discrepancies most likely
result from technical differences in the assays used to examine immune
cell function. In this regard, we opted for functional assays that empha-
sized short incubation times and minimal experimental manipulation
of immune cells, whose functions were interrogated in the context of
whole-blood samples.
Our analysis also enabled intriguing discoveries, especially with re-
gard to endogenous T cell function. Pregnancy induced a robust and
progressive increase in endogenous STAT5ab signaling across multiple
T cell subsets, including CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs, naïve and memory CD4+
and CD8+ T cells, and gd T cells. In ovarian cells, STAT5ab plays a crit-
ical role downstream of PRL in maintaining progesterone levels during
pregnancy (33). However, the importance of the progressively increased
endogenous STAT5ab signaling activity in peripheral T cell subsets is
unknown. Our data suggest that IL-2, perhaps in conjunction with
other immune or hormonal mediators including IL-3 and PRL, is a
prime candidate as an upstream activator of STAT5ab signaling in
T cell subsets. Alternatively, observed changes in circulating IL-2 levels
during pregnancy may be a downstream effect of antigen-dependent
activation of CD4+ T cells, because activated CD4+ T cells are the main
cellular sources of IL-2 (26, 34). The IL-2/STAT5ab signaling pathway
regulatesmanyaspectsof Tcelldifferentiation.IL-2–dependentSTAT5ab
activity is essential for the development of CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs, which
are critically implicated in the maintenance of feto-maternal tolerance
during pregnancy (35). In pregnant mice, Treg depletion via an IL-2 re-
ceptor (CD25)–specific antibody results in early resorption of the allo-
geneic fetus (36). Our finding of increased circulating IL-2 during
pregnancy indicates that activated T cells may play an autocrine and/or
paracrine role in enhancing immune regulation by Tregs during preg-
nancy. Thus, the progressive increase in endogenous STAT5ab signal-
ing activity may reflect at least in part an increasing requirement for the
presence of Tregs throughout human pregnancy.
This study has several limitations. First, the cohort included women
who all delivered at term but had various medical and obstetric his-
tories. These clinical characteristics may of course modulate aspects
of the immune response to pregnancy and contribute to observed inter-
individual variability. Our study was therefore designed to ask, “is there
an immunological progression associated with gestational age in preg-
nancies that reach full term?” Despite some heterogeneity in the patient
cohort, we were able to capture the chronology of immune adaptations
over the course of term pregnancies and validate these findings in an

 independent cohort. On the other hand, the recruitment of participants
from a single-care center limited the diversity of the study cohort. In the
future, it will be important to test the generalizability of our approach
and examine variations in the csEN model associated with ethnic, racial,
and socioeconomic differences. Second, the introduction of a signaling-
based penalization favored ligand-specific signaling pathways by a 5:1
margin over other signaling responses. The rationale for introducing a
signaling-based penalization was to reduce the impact of biologically
less plausible immune features (such as induction of STAT3 by LPS
in cell subsets not known to transduce TLR4 receptor signaling). This
approach significantly improved the predictive power of the csEN
model. However, a caveat inherent to cell signaling–based weighting
is a decreased sensitivity for detecting biologically relevant but not
particularly pronounced signaling responses. Last, although mass cy-
tometry currently enables the simultaneous detection of more than
50 parameters, the technology remains limited to the analysis of prese-
lected surface markers, intracellular responses and stimulation
conditions. Future studies will expand on this effort and examine
whether deeper phenotyping of specific cell subsets and interrogation
of agreaterrange of signaling responseswillimprovethe predictivevalue
of the csEN model.
Our study revealed a precisely timed chronology of immune adapta-
tions in peripheral blood over the course of a term pregnancy. This
finding was enabled by high-content, single-cell mass cytometry
coupled with a csEN algorithm accounting for the modular structure
of the immune system and previous knowledge. The study provides
the conceptual backbone and the analytical framework to examine
whether disruption of this chronology is a diagnostically useful
characteristic of preterm birth and other pregnancy-related pathologies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The aim of this observational study was to determine whether a precise
chronology of pregnancy-related immunological adaptations is detect-
able from the mass cytometry analysis of peripheral immune cell phe-
notype and functional changes during pregnancy. The study was
conducted at the Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital (Stanford, CA).
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and all par-
ticipants signed an informed consent. Pregnant women receiving rou-
tine antepartum care were eligible for the study if they were 18 years of
age and in their first trimester of pregnancy. Participants were followed
longitudinally until 6 weeks after delivery of the fetus. Comorbidities
included hypertension (3), asthma (2), hypothyroidism (2), and auto-
immunehepatitis(1).Onlyparticipantsthatdeliveredatterm(≥37weeks
of gestation) were included in the analysis. Pregnancy complications in-
cluded mild gestational hypertension (2) and preeclampsia (2). Demo-
graphics and pregnancy characteristics for the 28 participants included
in the analysis are summarized in Table 1.
Derivation of mass cytometry immune features
Whole-blood samples collected at three time points during pregnancy
(an early-, a mid-, and a late-pregnancy time point) and 6 weeks post-
partum were stimulated for 15 min with either LPS, IFN-a, or a cocktail
containing IL-2 and IL-6, or left unstimulated. Samples were then pro-
cessed using a standardized protocol for fixation (Smart Tube Inc.), bar-
coding, and antibody staining of whole-blood samples for mass
cytometry analysis (see the Supplementary Materials) (13). Mass cy-
tometry data from each sample were manually gated into 24 immune
cell types of interest (fig. S1). Three categories of immune features were
derived:
Cellfrequency features: Cell frequencieswere expressed as a percent-
age of gated singlets in the case of neutrophils and as a percentage of
mononuclear cells (CD45+CD66−) in the case of all other cell types.
Endogenous signaling immune features: Endogenous intracellular
signaling activities were derived from the analysis of unstimulated blood
samples. The signal intensity of the following functional markers was
simultaneously quantified per single cell: phospho (p) STAT1, pSTAT3,
pSTAT5, pNFkB, total IkB, pMAPKAPK2, pP38, prpS6, pERK1/2, and
pCREB. For each cell type, signaling immune features were calculated as
the median signal intensity (arcsinh transformed value) of each signal-
ing protein.
Intracellular signaling response features: The signal intensity of all
functional markers was analyzed from samples stimulated with LPS,
IFN-a, or IL. For each cell type, signaling responses were calculated
as the difference in median signal intensity (arcsinh transformed value)
of each signaling protein between the stimulated and unstimulated
conditions.
Proteomic analysis of circulating plasma factors
A total of 1310 proteins were assayed from plasma samples collected at
each time point using a highly multiplexed, aptamer-based platform
(SomaLogic Inc.) (37). See details in the Supplementary Materials.
Statistical analysis
Multivariate modeling of mass cytometry data using a cell
signaling–based matrix
The csEN algorithm was adapted from the existing EN algorithm (18)
to allow accounting for the influence of previous knowledge of intra-
cellular signal transduction on the generation of the mass cytometry
data set. For a matrix X of all immune features and a vector of estimated
gestational age at time of sampling Y, a multivariate model was devel-
oped to calculate the coefficients b for each entity in X to minimize the
overall differences from Y: L(b) = |Y – Xb|2. An L1 regularization (38)
was applied on the b coefficients to reduce the model complexity, such
that L(b) = |Y − Xb|2 + l1|b|1, where l1 is selected by cross-validation.
This produces a sparse model in which only a limited number of
features are used. However, this approach is not ideal for the analysis
of the highly interrelated mass cytometry data set, because it would se-
lectonly representativesof communitiesof correlated featureswhile dis-
regarding highly correlated but potentially biologically relevant features.
Thislimitation isaddressed by using an additional L2 regularization (18)
to allow the inclusion of highly correlated measurements: L(b) = |Y −
Xb|2 + l1|b|1 + l2|b|2, where l1 and l2 are selected by cross-validation.
To account for the fact that previous biological knowledge of intra-
cellular signal transduction influences the selection of markers included
in the mass cytometry panel, we introduced a previously unknown term
into the model that allowed prioritizing receptor-specific signaling re-
sponses selected a priori by a cell signaling–based matrix (described in
Fig. 2 and table S2):

cross-validation analysis evaluating the correlation between the model
and the gestationalage at time of sampling (see the csEN algorithm eval-
uation section in the Supplementary Materials). The optimization
algorithm was initialized using an exhaustive search with a uniform grid
for all values in [0, 1]. Optimization results for φ and y were φ ~ 0.21
