Small-molecule inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) antagonists, called Smac mimetic compounds
(SMCs), sensitize tumours to TNF-a-induced killing while simultaneously blocking TNF-a
growth-promoting activities. SMCs also regulate several immunomodulatory properties
within immune cells. We report that SMCs synergize with innate immune stimulants
and immune checkpoint inhibitor biologics to produce durable cures in mouse models of
glioblastoma in which single agent therapy is ineffective. The complementation of activities
between these classes of therapeutics is dependent on cytotoxic T-cell activity and is
associated with a reduction in immunosuppressive T-cells. Notably, the synergistic effect is
dependent on type I IFN and TNF-a signalling. Furthermore, our results implicate an
important role for TNF-a-producing cytotoxic T-cells in mediating the anti-cancer effects of
immune checkpoint inhibitors when combined with SMCs. Overall, this combinatorial
approach could be highly effective in clinical application as it allows for cooperative and
complimentary mechanisms in the immune cell-mediated death of cancer cells.

vasion of apoptosis and avoidance of immune attack
represent two key hallmarks of cancer1. Members of the
inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) gene family play important
interconnecting roles in both of these characteristic pathways of
tumorigenesis2, providing a critical nexus in the targeting of
cancer. Small-molecule antagonists of the IAPs, known as Smac
mimetic compounds (SMCs), are in clinical development for
cancer therapy3. SMCs were found to exert immunological effects
leading to the eradication of tumours4,5. Mechanistically, SMCs
bind to cellular IAP 1 and 2 (cIAP1 and cIAP2), which induces
the auto-ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal-mediated
degradation of these IAPs6. At higher
doses, SMCs
can
antagonize X-linked IAP (XIAP), de-repressing the ability of
XIAP to inhibit pro-apoptotic caspases. These three IAPs are E3
ubiquitin ligases that control diverse signalling pathways through
post-translational ubiquitination reactions, including pathways
central to immunity7. The SMC drug-sustained loss of IAPs has
important consequences. First, SMC-mediated antagonism of the
IAPs sensitizes cancer cells to death ligands originating from
the immune system by switching tumour necrosis factor alpha
(TNF-a) from a survival factor to a potent death factor, leading to
death through the ripoptosome or the necrosome8,9. Second, the
loss of the cIAPs activates the alternative nuclear factor kappa B
(NF-kB) pathway through the stabilization of NF-kB-inducing
kinsase (NIK) in cells10. NIK is a target of the cIAPs, wherein
NIK is constitutively ubiquitinated and degraded. However, on
binding of a TNF superfamily ligand to their cognate receptor,
such as CD137 (aka, 4-1BB), the cIAPs are sequestered and
degraded, thereby allowing for the accumulation of NIK and
activation of the alternative NF-kB pathway10,11.
In general, tumours are resistant to the induction of apoptosis
due to the p53-mediated adaptations of the intrinsic mitochon-
drial cell death pathway to damaging DNA lesions and prior
chemotherapy treatments12. In contrast, the extrinsic cell death
pathway, which responds to death ligands from the immune
system, is typically intact in cancer cells12. Thus, the extrinsic
pathway provides an avenue to exploit for the induction of cancer
cell death. However, tumours have evolved other means to
suppress
immune
attack
such
as
by
upregulating
T-cell
co-inhibitory molecules, typified by Programmed death-ligand
(PD-L1, a.k.a., CD274), on the cancer cell surface. The recent
clinical successes for antibody-based biologics, called immune
checkpoint
inhibitors
(ICIs),
which
target
molecules
like
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1, a.k.a. CD279), have
demonstrated
remarkable
efficacy13–15.
ICIs
overcome
the
countervailing immune checkpoint blockade and promote the
immune system to attack tumour cells. However, these drugs are
not without limitations: a notable example is the appearance of
limiting toxicities related to the induction of autoimmunity.
Here, we investigate the efficacy of targeting cIAP1 and cIAP2
with a SMC in combination with an immunotherapy agent for the
treatment of glioblastoma. We demonstrate that SMCs and ICIs
combine to form an effective immunotherapy for the treatment in
mouse models of this deadly brain cancer, and for other cancers,
such as mammary carcinoma and multiple myeloma/plasmacy-
toma. In addition to the synergy that we have found with innate
immune stimulants, our results uncover a second important
mechanism by which SMCs exert their anti-cancer effects,
specifically through the potentiation of cytotoxic T-cell (CTL)
activity against tumours, which is amplified with an ICI.
Results
Combining immunostimulatory agents for glioblastoma therapy.
We previously found that SMC-mediated death of cancer cell
lines was potentiated with a type I IFN-inducing oncolytic virus,
such as the attenuated rhabdovirus Vesicular stomatitis virus
(VSVD51)16. VSVD51 infection lacks cytolytic activity for the
tested glioma cell lines, presumably due the presence of a partial
type I interferon (IFN) response17. Notably, cIAP2 (a mediator
and an indicator of NF-kB activity) is upregulated in glioblastoma
tumours, showing that cIAP2 promotes tumorigenesis and
further drives therapeutic resistance18–20. We show here that
cultured and primary glioblastoma cell lines are killed with SMC
when combined with exogenous TNF-a, the oncolytic virus
VSVD51 or with an infectious
but non-replicating
virus,
VSVD51DG (Fig. 1a,b). We confirmed that the synergistic
effects between the SMC, LCL161, and TNF-a is a general
phenomena within this drug class, as we observed death of
glioblastoma cells with the combination of TNF-a and different
SMCs (Supplementary Fig. 1). Furthermore, we also observed
potentiation of SMC efficacy with the oncolytic rhabdoviruses,
VSVD51 or Maraba-MG1, for human brain tumour-initiating
cells (BTICs) (Fig. 1c). Non-replicating rhabdovirus particles
(NRRPs), which retain their infectious and immunostimulatory
properties without the ability to replicate21, similarly were found
to synergize with SMCs to induce glioblastoma cell death
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Notably, only B50% of profiled cancer
cell lines are sensitized to death in combination of SMC and
TNF-a or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL); the
majority of resistant cell lines are further sensitized to death with
the downregulation of the caspase-8 inhibitor, cFLIP (cellular
FLICE-like inhibitory protein)22. Consistent with this previous
finding, two glioblastoma lines that are refractory to combined
treatment with SMC and TNF-a or VSVD51DG were killed upon
silencing of cFLIP (Supplementary Fig. 3). Normal diploid
human fibroblasts, in contrast, were not sensitized to cell death
with the downregulation of cFLIP and combined treatment.
These findings suggest that an IFN and/or cytokine response,
and not direct virus-induced cytolysis, are responsible for the
SMC-induced death of glioblastoma cells.
Since VSVD51 is neurotoxic, and since issues remain about the
‘immune privileged’ brain microenvironment and penetration of
drugs across the blood–brain barrier (BBB), we set out to test
the effects of systemic and intracranial immunotherapy agent
delivery. Following the establishment of intracranial CT-2A tumours
(Supplementary Fig. 4), we tested whether systemic administration by
oral gavage of the SMC, LCL161, could cause the transient
degradation of its primary targets proteins, cIAP1 and cIAP2, within
intracranial murine tumours. We observed downregulation of cIAP1/
2 within CT-2A brain tumours in SMC-treated mice (Fig. 2a).
In contrast, we did not observe downregulation of the cIAPs
in neighbouring non-tumorous brain tissue (Fig. 2a) nor in the cortex
or cerebellum in non-tumour bearing mice (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Therefore, SMCs have the capacity to reach tumours within the brain
that have a compromised BBB. The systemic administration of
immunostimulatory agents, such as the synthetic TLR3 agonist
poly(I:C) injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) or the oncolytic virus
VSVD51 administered intravenously (i.v.), induced the production of
cytokine TNF-a in the serum and brain of non-tumour bearing mice
(Fig. 2b). Our results are in agreement with a report demonstrating
that systemic infection or immune stimulation induces cytokine
production including type I IFN within the brain23. When mice
bearing intracranial CT-2A glioblastoma were treated singly with
SMC (oral gavage), VSVD51 (i.v.) or poly(I:C) (intracranially, i.c.),
the extension of mouse survival was minimal for this aggressive
cancer (17% survival rate) (Fig. 2c). However, the combination of
systemic SMC with an immunostimulatory trigger, VSVD51 or
poly(I:C), significantly extended survival and resulted in durable
cures for 71 or 86% of the mice, respectively. Tumours (which were
not tagged with a foreign protein to avoid enhanced immunity) were
imaged at day 40 post-implantation by MRI to confirm the observed
treatment outcomes (Fig. 2d).

 The virus-induced immune effects are mediated in part by type
I IFNs. We show here that CT-2A cells are partially sensitive to
combined SMC and recombinant IFN-a in vitro (Fig. 2e). We
observed that the intracranial administration of SMC resulted in
even more profound degradation of the IAP proteins in CT-2A
brain tumours (Supplementary Fig. 6). For in vivo studies, we
used a form of recombinant IFN-a that consists of a hybrid of
human isoforms IFN-a B and IFN-a D, which displays potent
antiviral activity among a broad range of species24. A single
co-administration of SMC and IFN-a significantly extended
mouse survival and resulted in a 50% durable cure rate (Fig. 2f).
Long-term survivors displayed no overt physical or behavioural
defects from the single or combined intracranial treatments of
SMC, poly(I:C) or IFN-a (Fig. 2c,f; Supplementary Fig. 7).
Furthermore, as we observed a transient increase of intracranial
TNF-a within the brain on systemic VSVD51 infection or
treatment with poly(I:C) (Fig. 2b), we sought to determine
whether systemic administration of recombinant IFN-a alongside
with SMC treatment would be efficacious in the CT-2A
glioblastoma model. Similar to the combination of SMC and
VSVD51, the combination of IFN-a administered i.p. with oral
gavage of SMC resulted in durable cures in 55% of the
mice (Fig. 2g). These results suggest that the presence of a
transient inflammatory environment in the brain is tolerable and
indicate that indirect and other direct (intracranial) routes of
combination treatment administration may be feasible.
Generation of long-term tumour immunity in cured mice. The
innate immune system is a key player in the SMC-mediated death
of tumour cells16. Nevertheless, fundamental questions remain as
to the contributory role of the adaptive immune system in
this SMC combination approach. Furthermore, a potential
pitfall of the proposed use of oncolytic viruses or other
immunostimulatory agents in combination with SMC treatment
could be the increase in expression of checkpoint inhibitor
ligands on cancer cells, thereby negating CTL-mediated attack of
tumours25. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that treatment of
glioma cells with recombinant type I IFN or infection with
VSVD51, but not treatment with TNF-a, resulted in the increased
surface expression of PD-L1 and major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) I markers. Moreover, there was no significant
impact on the expression of these tumour surface molecules by
SMC treatment (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Fig. 8).

 Interestingly, mice previously cured of orthotopic EMT6
mammary carcinomas by combined SMC treatments were
completely resistant to tumour engraftment when rechallenged
with EMT6 cells (Fig. 3b). However, another syngeneic cell line,
4T1, that shares the major histocompatibility proteins, was not
rejected from these cured mice. We found that mice cured with
intracranial CT-2A tumours were also resistant to tumour
engraftment of CT-2A cells injected either subcutaneously or
intracranially (Fig. 3c). We next evaluated the cytotoxic potential
of CD8 T-cells from cured mice via an ELISpot assay. Stimulation
of CD8 þ T-cells from cured mice, but not cells isolated from
naive mice, with CT-2A cells revealed the presence of specific
reactive T-cells, as demonstrated by enhanced IFN-g and
Granzyme B (GrzB) production (Fig. 4a). The inclusion of
anti-PD-1 blocking antibodies further increased the expression
of IFN-g and GrzB. Similar results were observed with mice cured

 of EMT6 tumours (Supplementary Fig. 9). Collectively, these
results suggest the generation of a robust and specific long-term
tumour immunity using SMC combination therapy.
Immune checkpoint inhibitors synergize with IAP antagonists.
We
next
investigated
whether
a
current
class
of
cancer
immunotherapy, known as immune checkpoint inhibitors or
ICIs, could enhance SMC efficacy. It has been recently reported
that ICI treatment of glioblastoma in mice results in at least a
partial extension of survival26,27. We first sought to determine
whether SMC treatment influences PD-1 expression in a subset of
infiltrating immune cells within CT-2A brain tumours. While
there was no statistical difference between the levels of infiltrating
CD3 þ
or CD3 þ
CD8 þ
cells within intracranial CT-2A
tumours, we observed a robust increase of CD3 þ and CD3 þ
CD8 þ cells expressing the immune checkpoint, PD-1 (Fig. 4b;
Supplementary Fig. 10). Although there was a general increase
in the expression of PD-L1 in CD45 �
cells, which are
predominantly CT-2A cells, the trend did not reach statistical
significance (Fig. 4c).
To determine whether the increased levels of PD-1 þ CD8 þ
T-cells may be a negative modulator for SMC efficacy, we also
assessed blocking the checkpoint target, PD-1, as well as CTLA-4,
in
combination
with
SMC
using
two
mouse
models
of
glioblastoma. The systemic administration of anti-PD-1 or
anti-CTLA4 antibodies demonstrated no activity on their own
(Fig. 4d,e). In contrast, the combination of anti-PD-1 and SMC
significantly extended survival and resulted in 71% and 33%
durable cure rates in the CT-2A and GL261 models, respectively.
Furthermore, when combined with a SMC, the anti-PD-1 biologic
was superior to the anti-CTLA4 biologic in the CT-2A model
(71% versus 43%) (Fig. 4d). There are two structural classes of
SMCs: monomers and dimers. Monomeric SMCs consist of a
single chemical molecule that binds to the BIR domains of the
IAPs while dimeric SMCs consist of two SMC molecules
connected by a linker allowing for cooperative binding and/or
tethering of IAPs. A clinically advanced SMC, LCL161, is the
focus of most of our studies, and is a potent monomer. We next
sought to assess whether another clinically advanced dimeric
SMC similarly synergizes with an ICI for the treatment of
glioblastoma. Similar to our previous results, we observed a
significant increase in survival of mice bearing intracranial CT-2A
tumours when treated with anti-PD-1 and the dimer SMC,
Birinapant (Fig. 4f). As the combined blockade of PD-1 or
CTLA-4 is beneficial for patients with melanoma28, we sought to
determine whether the combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-
CTLA-4 would similarly significantly enhance SMC therapy.
Consistent with a previous report, the combination of antibodies
targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4 was effective at inducing durable
cures in a mouse model of cancer27, as we observed an overall
survival rate of 67% (Fig. 4g). Strikingly, the inclusion of SMC
treatment with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 together resulted in a
100% durable cure rate.
The synergistic effect between SMC and ICIs is not restricted to
brain tumours. We also observed a significant extension of the
survival of mice bearing a highly aggressive and treatment
refractory model of multiple myeloma using MPC-11 cells
(Supplementary Fig. 11). A durable cure rate of 75% was also
obtained in mice harbouring mammary EMT6 tumours, which
was further increased to 100% with the inclusion of an immune
stimulant (Supplementary Fig. 12).
CD8 þ T-cells are required for efficacy of SMCs and ICIs. To
provide an initial insight into the cellular mechanism of action,
we profiled the production of immune factors from CT-2A cells
that were cocultured with splenocytes derived from mice cured of
intracranial CT-2A tumours using combined SMC and anti-PD-1
treatment. Similar to that depicted in Fig. 4a and Supplementary
Fig. 9, we observed a significant increase in the production of
IFN-g and GrzB from CT-2A cells co-incubated with splenocytes

 derived from surviving mice (Fig. 5a; Supplementary Fig. 13a).
Notably, there was an increase in the production of Interleukin
17 (IL-17), which has been shown to promote an antitumor
cytotoxic T-cell response29. We also observed a reduction in the
expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-a,
which was unexpected, given that IL-17 has been previously
found
to
stimulate
the

However,
the
expression of IFN-g and IL-17 from splenocytes isolated from

 augmented on checkpoint inhibition through the PD-1 axis. We
next sought to determine whether this cytokine response is
affected by SMC treatment. Among the previously analysed
cytokines, the inclusion of SMC in these cocultures along with
anti-PD-1 blockade increased the secretion of IFN-g, GrzB, IL-17
and TNF-a (Fig. 5b; Supplementary Fig. 13b). Notably, the level
of IL-6 in the supernatant was not affected by SMC treatment.
Furthermore, the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 had a
general trend of decreased secretion with combined SMC and
anti-PD-1 treatment. As there is an increase in the levels of GrzB,
a cytotoxic factor that is partially blocked by XIAP31–33, and
TNF-a, we next assessed whether cocultures of glioblastoma cells
with splenocytes from naive mice or mice previously cured of
CT-2A intracranial tumours would lead to death of CT-2A cells.
Using

structured
SMCs,
we
saw
a
statistically
significant increase in the death of CT-2A cells in the presence
of SMCs, and this response was increased with the inclusion of

 Collectively, these results indicate that a robust effector T-cell
response is elicited with the combination treatment of ICI and
SMC. To further elucidate the cellular mechanism of action, we
undertook the depletion of immune cells using specific CD4 or
CD8 targeting antibodies. We found that the 71% cure rate
induced by the combination therapy is completely abrogated on
depletion of CD8 þ T-cells (Fig. 5d). Interestingly, the depletion
of CD4 þ
T-cells resulted in a 100% cure rate with the
combination of SMC and anti-PD-1, and a 17% cure rate in the
control group. These results suggest that removal of CD4 þ
immunosuppressive cells (such as regulatory T-cells) aids with
the induction of tumour regression and that CD4 þ cells are not
required for efficacy of the combined treatment approach34.
In a second approach, intracranial CT-2A tumours were
established
in
CD-1
nude
mice,
which
lack
functional
T-cells, and then treated with the combination of anti-PD-1
antibodies
with
vehicle
or
SMC.
The
survival
advantage
provided by the SMC and anti-PD-1 combination was lost in
these T-cell deficient mice (Fig. 5e). Overall, the synergistic
effect
between
SMC
and
anti-PD-1
is
dependent
on
a
functional adaptive immune response and thus implicates
CD8 þ
T-cells as the primary immune cell mediators for
long-term in vivo efficacy.
SMC treatment affects intratumoral immune cell infiltration.
To understand the immune cellular aspect of the synergy between
SMC and ICI treatment, we evaluated the profiles of infiltrating
CD45 þ immune cells in mice bearing glioblastoma. In these
studies, we evaluated the infiltrating immune cells in later stage
glioblastoma tumours following anti-PD-1 and SMC cotreatment
(Fig. 6a). A flow cytometry analysis of tumour infiltrating T-cells
revealed a statistically insignificant trend in the proportion of
CD4 þ and CD8 þ T-cells between the vehicle and IgG control
treatment group and all single and double-treated mice (Fig. 6b).
However, an analysis of CD4 þ and CD25 þ T-cells, indicative of
a regulatory T-cell (Treg) population35, revealed a significant
decrease of this cell population with SMC treatment alone or
combination of SMC and ICI (Fig. 6c). Next, we characterized the
surface presentation of PD-1 in T-cells following single and
combinatorial treatment. As previously observed (Fig. 4b), we
noted a significant increase in CD8 þ T-cells expressing PD-1 in
mice treated with SMC alone, and the treatment of anti-PD-1 or
combined treatment of SMC and anti-PD-1 resulted in less
detectable surface presentation of PD-1 (Fig. 6d). In addition, we
observed a trend in the decreased presentation of PD-1 in CD4 þ
T-cells in SMC or anti-PD-1 treatment groups. However, the
detectable level of surface PD-1 was abrogated with combinatorial
treatment of SMC and anti-PD-1 (Fig. 6e).
In addition to the observed T-cell infiltration of intracranial
glioblastoma tumours, we next characterized the presence
of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and astrocytes/
microglia. In contrast to a previous report27, we did not detect
differences in the MDSC population (CD11b þ Gr1 þ) in any
treatment cohorts (Fig. 6f). However we noted that the astrocyte/
microglia population was significantly decreased in the treatment
cohorts that included anti-PD-1 (Fig. 6g). Overall, these results
indicate that the consequence of combinatorial treatment is the
decrease of an immunosuppressive CD4 þ T-cell population with
a concomitant decrease of PD-1 presentation in T-cells and a
reduction of astrocytes and/or microglia.
SMC synergy with ICIs is dependent on TNF-a. We next
characterized the tumoral cellular cytokine and chemokine
profiles of mice bearing intracranial glioblastoma tumours treated
with combinations of SMC and anti-PD-1. Flow cytometry
analysis revealed that there was an increase of CD8 þ cells
expressing GrzB with the inclusion of anti-PD-1 antibodies. The
ratio of cytotoxic CD8 þ (Fig. 7a) and CD4 þ Treg ratio was also
increased in the anti-PD-1 and SMC and anti-PD-1 treatment
cohorts (Fig. 7b). In addition to assessing GrzB expression, we
analysed the levels of IFN-g and TNF-a in T-cells. Unexpectedly,
we observed a decrease in the proportion of CD4 þ
cells
expressing IFN-g on SMC treatment (even in inclusion of
antibodies targeting PD-1) but saw no change in the expression
level of IFN-g in any treatment cohort within CD8 þ cells
(Fig. 7c). As a main mode of cell death mediated by SMCs relies
on the engagement of the apoptotic pathways in cancer cells on
stimulation by TNF-a, we accordingly analysed the expression
level of TNF-a in T-cells. In this context, we observed a
significant increase of TNF-a expressing CD4 þ and CD8 þ
T-cells (Fig. 7d), indicating that these T-cells can directly induce
SMC-mediated tumour cell death.
We also evaluated the effect of combined SMC treatment and
anti-PD-1 blockade on serum concentration and gene expression
levels of cytokines and chemokines in the intracranial CT-2A
glioblastoma model. We detected statistically significant increases
in the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-b, IL-1-a, IL-1b, IL-17 and
the multifaceted cytokines IFN-g, IL-27 and GM-CSF (Fig. 7e;
Supplementary Fig. 14). Notably, there was no difference in the
presence of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. Similarly,
an analysis of the cytokine and chemokine expression profiles
within intracranial CT-2A tumours following combined SMC and
ICI treatment revealed clustering of proinflammatory cytokines
and chemokines (Fig. 7f; Supplementary Fig. 15). Among these
candidates from SMC or combined SMC and ICI treatment were
the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-b, IL-1b, IL-17, Osm and
TNF-a, the chemokines Ccl2 (also known as MCP-1), Ccl5, Ccl7,
Ccl22, Cxcl9, Cscl10 and Cxcl11, and multifaceted factors such as
FasL, IL-2, IL-12 and IFN-g. As we observed a consistent increase
in the levels of IFN-b and IFN-g, we next sought to characterize
the functional role of these signalling molecules with the use of
blocking/neutralizing antibodies in mice bearing intracranial
CT-2A tumours and treated with SMC and anti-PD-1. Abrogation
of type I IFN signalling by using an antibody that blocks
the IFNAR1 receptor negated the synergistic effects towards
increasing survival of mice bearing intracranial CT-2A tumours
following combined SMC and anti-PD-1 treatment (Fig. 7g).
In contrast, antagonism of IFN-g function by employing an
anti-IFN-g antibody partially inhibited the synergistic effects of
combined SMC and ICI treatment. Overall, these results indicate
that each treatment agent, including when combined, results in
the generation of different gene and protein signatures, but
overall, is dependent on intact type I IFN signalling.
Overall, our results indicate that the synergistic effects between
SMC and ICI can be primarily attributed towards enhancing a
CTL-mediated attack against glioblastoma cells, and this involves
a proinflammatory response that includes type I IFN. The
coculture of CT-2A cells and CD8 þ T-cells isolated from mice
previously cured of intracranial tumours resulted, as expected, in
an increase of GrzB positive CD8 þ T-cells, which was not
increased
with SMC treatment alone (Fig. 8a). However,
there was only a slight decrease of viable CT-2A cells when
co-incubated with the same CTLs, even when the PD-1/PD-L1
axis was abrogated (Fig. 8b). As we previously noted that the type
I IFN response also leads to the production of TNF-a16, we
assessed the ability of T-cells to produce TNF-a following SMC
treatment in the presence of glioblastoma cells. Accordingly, we
next evaluated the production of TNF-a. The inclusion of SMC
significantly increased the proportion of CD8 þ T-cells expressing
TNF-a, regardless of inclusion of antibodies targeting PD-1
(Fig. 8a). In accordance with the increased expression level of

 TNF-a from CD8 þ T-cells, we observed significant decrease of
CT-2A cells in a coculture system using CT-2A cells and CD8 þ
T-cells from cured mice (Fig. 8b). Notably, the SMC-mediated
effects on eliciting death of CT-2A cells were mainly dependent
on TNF-a (the primary mediator of SMC-induced tumour
killing). Next, we evaluated whether SMC treatment enhances
T-cell proliferation. Indeed, we observed a significant decrease of
CFSE-loaded CD8 þ T-cells, along with the appearance of a new
population of faintly labelled CFSE-cells, following co-incubation
of CT-2A cells, and this effect was pronounced with the inclusion
of SMC and anti-PD-1 (Supplementary Fig. 16).
These results indicate that cytotoxic T-cells, in response to
SMC and anti-PD-1 treatment, may lead to enhanced tumour cell
death due to the increased production of GrzB and TNF-a, pro-
death factors that induce tumour cell death due to the antagonism
of the IAPs. We functionally characterized the role of TNF-a by
employing blocking antibodies targeting TNF-a. When systemic
blockade of TNF-a was applied, we observed almost a complete

 reversal of the efficacy of combined SMC and ICI treatment
(Fig. 8c), highlighting the importance of TNF-a for the synergistic
effect of these disparate agents.
Discussion
SMCs are a class of molecularly targeted drugs that are being
evaluated as an anti-cancer therapy. The immunomodulatory
anti-cancer
effects
of
SMCs
are
multimodal
(Fig.
9;
Supplementary Fig. 17). SMCs can polarize macrophages away
from the immunosuppressive M2 type towards the inflammatory
TNF-a-producing M1 phenotype36. Moreover, SMC anti-cancer
effects are highly potentiated by proinflammatory cytokines, and
the presence of these cytokines, such as TNF-a or TRAIL, within
the tumour microenvironment leads to tumour cell death16,37–39.
Specifically, SMC-mediated depletion of the cIAPs converts the
TNF-a-mediated survival response into a death pathway in
cancer cells. Recently, we demonstrated that a self-limiting
cytokine storm that includes TNF-a and TRAIL can be generated
with immunostimulatory agents to safely synergize with SMCs to
cure mice of cancer and that this outcome depends largely on
innate immunity16. Similarly, the delivery of cell-permeable Smac
peptides with recombinant TRAIL was found to lead to a
significant increase in survival of mice bearing intracranial
glioblastoma tumours40. In addition, the cIAPs also regulate the
activation of the alternative NF-kB pathway in immune cells,

 which is postulated to produce co-stimulatory signals to enhance
adaptive immune responses against tumours5,10,41. In support of
this concept, it is relevant that SMCs stimulate dendritic cell
maturation42 and T-cell proliferation, and potentiate cytotoxic
T-cell activation and expansion in the absence of ligands such as
4-1BB5,43. Notably, these SMC-mediated effects have also been
shown to increase T-cell activity of a cancer vaccine approach5.
Our current studies demonstrate that SMCs can cooperate and
dramatically intensify the action of ICIs, including anti-PD-1 or
anti-CTLA-4
antibodies,
allowing
for
durable
cures
of
mice bearing aggressive intracranial tumours. The multiplicity
and complexity of mechanisms involved with SMC therapy
make
it
difficult
to
isolate
the
individual
roles
for
the
varied immunomodulatory actions in the combination synergy.
However, it is clear from this and previous work that TNF-a
cytotoxicity is involved. Moreover, the current study further
demonstrates that CD8 þ T-cells are also required for anti-cancer
activity when an ICI is combined with an SMC.
We chose glioblastoma as a model to study because it
represents a high-fatality cancer for which immunotherapy is
being investigated as a potential therapy. In addition, cIAP1 and
cIAP2, which are co-amplified in some brain tumours18,
represent valid drug targets for glioblastoma. Brain cancer
also raises additional challenges for testing cancer therapies,
as drug-penetration across the BBB may be an impediment to
drug activity and differences in the brain immune system may
affect
tumour
immunotherapies.
We
show
that
the
oral
administration of the monomer SMC, LCL161 (ref. 44) can
induce the antagonism of its IAP targets within brain tumours,
yet does not lead to downregulation of the IAP proteins in normal
(non-tumorous) brain tissues. The penetrance of SMCs may
be explained by the compromised BBB which is seen in
brain
tumours.
In
addition,
we
find
that
systemically
applied immunostimulatory agents such as oncolytic VSV or
recombinant IFN-a can result in increased TNF-a in the brain
to
potentially
kill
tumours
with
SMCs,
releasing
tumour
antigens and stimulating inflammatory and immunomodulatory
responses.
Our
results
are
in
agreement
with
a
report
demonstrating that systemic infection or immune stimulation
induces cytokine production including type I IFN within the
brain23. Importantly, the systemic administration of antibody-
based drugs targeting ICIs have been found to induce tumour
responses for intracranial glioblastoma in mouse models and for
humans with melanoma brain metastases26,27,45,46. It may be that
these antibodies may infiltrate into brain tumours or that the
antibodies coat T-cells in the periphery blocking the inhibitory
action of immune checkpoint molecules once they extravagate
from the circulation into brain tissue and then into the tumour
microenvironment47.
We and others shown that SMCs or Smac peptides kill cancer
cells when combined with immunostimulatory agents that induce
IL-1b, IFN-b, TNF-a and TRAIL16,31–33,40. In this report, we
show for the first time that SMCs can potentiate the activity of
ICIs in mouse tumour models. Furthermore, this combination
effect depends on the presence of CD8 þ
T-cells with a
concomitant decrease of immunosuppressive CD4 þ
T-cells,
and on the type I and II IFN and TNF-a signalling pathways,
clearly implicating the role of adaptive immunity for SMC-
mediated cures in mice. We propose that SMC-mediated T-cell
co-stimulatory signals provide the drive for adaptive immune
responses that develop against the tumour and this is fully
realized when the brakes imposed by co-inhibitory signals such as
PD-1
or
PD-L1
are
removed
with
ICIs.
Although,
this
mechanistic hypothesis remains to be firmly established, the
fact that SMCs can kill cancer cells by at least two different
mechanisms (involving both the innate and the adaptive immune
system) makes these immunomodulatory drugs a compelling and
rational class of agents that should be tested in a combination
immunotherapy
clinical
setting.
Indeed,
cancer
trials
testing SMC combination immunotherapies, in particular with
immune checkpoint inhibitors, are expected to initiate soon
(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02587962, NCT02890069). We eagerly
await the initiation of these trials as we continue to decipher the
many SMC-mediated immunomodulatory effects that potentiate
the killing of tumour cells.

Figure 9 | Cooperative and complimentary mechanisms for synergy
between SMCs and ICI. (1) The presence of therapeutic recombinant
antibodies that block the PD-1/PD-L1 axis allows for signalling of the TCR of
a CD8 þ T-cell with its associated antigen presented by the cancer cell
through a MHC-I molecule. Concurrent depletion of the IAPs through SMC
treatment can enhance T-cell activation, likely by providing a tumour
necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) co-stimulatory response
(similar to 4-1BB or OX40 activation), resulting in enhanced activation and
expansion of tumour-specific CD8 þ T-cells. As a result, Granzyme B
(GrzB) and Perforin (Pfn) are secreted to kill target cells. (2) SMC-mediated
antagonism of the casp-3 inhibitor, XIAP, can result in enhanced death of
tumour cells by GrzB. (3) The depletion of cIAP1 and cIAP2 by SMCs leads
to increased local production of TNF-a by T-cells in the tumour
microenvironment, an effect that is likely mediated by activation of the
alternative NF-kB pathway. (4) As a result of cIAP1/ 2 loss, SMC-treated
cancer cells are sensitized to cell death induction in the presence of
proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a.

 Assay Science. Broad host range IFN-aB/D was produced in yeast and purified by
affinity immunochromatography24. Nontargeting siRNA or siRNA targeting cFLIP
were obtained from Dharmacon (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool). High molecular
weight poly(I:C) was obtained from Invivogen.
Cell culture. Cells were maintained at 37 �C and 5% CO2 in DMEM media
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 1% non-essential
amino acids (Invitrogen). All of the cell lines were obtained from ATCC, with
the following exceptions: SNB75 (Dr D. Stojdl, Children’s Hospital of Eastern
Ontario Research Institute) and SF539 (UCSF Brain Tumor Bank). Primary
NF1 � / þp53 � / þ cells were derived from C57Bl/6 J p53 þ / �/NF1 þ / � mice49.
Cell lines were regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination. BTICs were
cultured in serum-free culture medium supplemented with EGF and FGF-2
(ref. 50). For siRNA transfections, cells were reverse transfected with Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) for 48 h as per the manufacturer’s protocol.
Viruses. The Indiana serotype of VSV was used in this study. VSV-EGFP,
VSVD51 (lacking amino acid 51 in the M gene) and Maraba-MG1 were propagated
in Vero cells and purified on an OptiPrep gradient. VSVD51 with the deletion
of the gene encoding for glycoprotein (VSVD51DG) was propagated in
HEK293T cells that were transfected with pMD2-G using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen), and purified on a sucrose cushion. NRRPs were generated by
exposing VSV-EGFP to ultraviolet (250 mJ cm � 2) using a XL-1000 ultraviolet
crosslinker (Spectrolinker)21.
In vitro viability assay. Cell lines were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated
overnight. Cells were treated with vehicle (0.05% DMSO) or LCL161 and infected
with the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI) of virus or treated with
1 mg ml � 1 IFN-aB/D, 0.1 ng ml � 1 TNF-a or the indicated of NRRPs for 48 h. Cell
viability was determined by Alamar blue (Resazurin sodium salt (Sigma)) and data
were normalized to vehicle treatment. The chosen sample size is consistent with
previous reports that used similar analyses for viability assays, but no statistical
methods were used to determine sample size16,22.
Western blotting. Cells were scraped, collected by centrifugation and lysed in
RIPA lysis buffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Tumours
were excised, minced and lysed as above. Equal amounts of soluble protein were
separated on polyacrylamide gels followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes.
Individual proteins were detected by western blotting using for cFLIP (7F10, 1:500,
from Alexis Biochemicals) and b-tubulin (1:1,000, E7 from Developmental Studies
Hybridoma Bank). Rabbit anti-rat IAP1 and IAP3 polyclonal antibodies were used
to detect human and mouse cIAP1/2 and XIAP, respectively (1:5,000)51 (Cyclex).
AlexaFluor680 (Invitrogen) or IRDye800 (Li-Cor) (1:2,500) were used to detect the
primary antibodies, and infrared fluorescent signals were detected using the
Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor). Full-length blots are located in
Supplementary Fig. 18.
ELISA. For detection of TNF-a in vivo, mice were treated with 50mg poly(I:C) i.p. or
5 � 108PFU of VSVD51 i.v. Brains were homogenized in 20mM HEPES-KOH (pH
7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and 1 mM MgCl2, supplemented with EDTA-free
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). NP-40 was added to final concentration of 0.1%
and clarified through centrifugation. Equal amounts were processed for the detection
of TNF-a with the TNF-a Quantikine assay kit (R&D Systems).
To assess the specificity of the adaptive immune response, mice cured of CT-2A
tumours by SMC and anti-PD-1 treatment and age-matched control (naive)
C57BL/6 female mice were injected subcutaneously with 1 � 106 CT-2A cells. After
seven days, splenocytes were isolated and cocultured with CT-2A cells for 48 h
(20:1 ratio of splenocytes to cancer cells) in the presence of vehicle or 5 mM SMC or
20 mg ml � 1 of the indicated antibodies. The secretion of IFN-g, GrzB, TNF-a,
IL-17, IL-6 and IL-10 was determined by ELISA (kits are from R&D Systems).
CT-2A and GL261 brain tumour models. Female 5-week-old C57BL/6 or CD-1
nude mice were anesthetized with isofluorane and the surgical site was shaved and
prepared with 70% ethanol. A total of 5 � 104 cells were stereotactically injected in
a 10-ml volume into the left striatum over 1 min into the following coordinates:
0.5 mm anterior, 2 mm lateral from bregma and 3.5 mm deep. The skin was closed
using surgical glue. Mice were treated with either vehicle (30% 0.1 M HCl, 70%
0.1 M NaOAc pH 4.63) or 75 mg kg � 1 LCL161 orally and intratumorally (i.t.) in
10 ml with 50 mg poly(I:C), i.v. with 5 � 108 VSVD51 or i.p. with 250 mg of anti-CD4
(GK1.5), anti-CD8 (YTS169.4), anti-PD-1 (J43) or CTLA-4 (9H10). For treatment
with birinapant, mice were treated with vehicle (12.5% Captisol) or 30 mg kg � 1
birinapant (i.p.). In some cases, animals were treated with anti-IFNAR1
(MAR1-5A3), anti-IFN-g (R4-6A2) or anti-TNF-a (XT3.11). Isotype control IgG
antibodies were used as appropriately: BE0091, BE0087, BP0090, MOPC-21
or HPRN. All neutralizing and control antibodies were from BioXCell. For
intracranial cotreatment of SMC and type I IFN, mice were injected 10 ml i.t. with
combinations of vehicle (0.5% DMSO), 100 mM LCL161, 0.01% BSA or 1 mg
IFN-aB/D. Alternatively, mice were treated orally with vehicle or 75 mg kg � 1
LCL161 and 1 mg IFN-a B/D (i.p.). Animals were euthanized when they showed
predetermined signs of neurologic deficits (failure to ambulate, weight loss 420%
body mass, lethargy, hunched posture). Treatment groups were assigned by cages
and each group had 5–9 mice for statistical measures (Kaplan–Meier with log-rank
analysis). There was no randomization and the lead investigator was blinded to
group allocation. The sample size is consistent with previous reports that examined
tumour growth and mouse survival following cancer treatment but no statistical
methods were used to determine sample size16,52.
MRI. Live mouse brain MRI was performed at the University of Ottawa
pre-clinical imaging core using a 7 Tesla GE/Agilent MR 901. Mice were
anaesthetized for the MRI procedure using isoflurane. A 2D fast spin echo
sequence (FSE) pulse sequence was used for the imaging, with the following
parameters: 15 prescribed slices, slice thickness ¼ 0.7 mm, spacing ¼ 0 mm, field of
view ¼ 2 cm, matrix ¼ 256 � 256, echo time ¼ 25 ms, repetition time ¼ 3,000 ms,
echo train length ¼ 8, bandwidth ¼ 16 kHz, 1 average, and fat saturation. The FSE
sequence was performed in both transverse and coronal planes, for a total imaging
time of about 5 min.
EMT6 mammary tumour model. Mammary tumours were established by
injecting 1 � 105 EMT6 cells in the mammary fat pad of 5-week-old female BALB/c
mice. Mice with palpable tumours (B100 mm3) were cotreated with either vehicle
(30% 0.1 M HCl, 70% 0.1 M NaOAc pH 4.63) or 50 mg kg � 1 LCL161 orally and
either i.t. injections of 5 � 108 PFU of VSVD51 or i.p. injections of control IgG
(BE0091) or anti-PD-1 (J43). Animals were killed when tumours metastasized i.p.
or when the tumour burden exceeded 2,000 mm3. Tumour volume was calculated
using (p)(W)2(L)/4, where W ¼ tumour width and L ¼ tumour length. Treatment
groups were assigned by cages and each group had 4 to 5 mice for statistical
measures (mean, standard error; Kaplan–Meier with log-rank analysis). There was
no randomization and the lead investigator was blinded to group allocation.
MPC-11 multiple myeloma model. A mouse model of multiple myeloma and
plasmacytoma was established by injecting 1 � 106 luciferase-tagged MPC-11 cells
(i.v.) into female 4–5-week-old BALB/c mice. Mice were treated with vehicle
(30% 0.1 M HCl, 70% 0.1 M NaOAc pH 4.63) or 75 mg kg � 1 LCL161 orally and
with 250 mg of control IgG or a-PD-1 antibodies (i.p). Bioluminescence imaging
was captured with a Xenogen 2000 IVIS CCD-camera system (Caliper Life
Sciences) following i.p. injection of 4 mg luciferin (Gold Biotechnology). Treatment
groups were assigned by cages and each group had 3 to 4 mice for statistical
measures (Kaplan–Meier with log-rank analysis). There was no randomization and
the lead investigator was blinded to group allocation.
Tumour rechallenge. Naive age-matched female C57BL/6 mice or mice previously
cured of intracranial CT-2A tumours by SMC-based combination treatment with
immunostimulants (minimum of 180 days post implantation) were reinjected with
CT-2A cells i.c. as described above or with 5 � 105 cells subcutaneously. Naive
BALB/c or mice previously cured of luciferase-tagged EMT6 mammary tumours
with SMC and VSVD51 combination treatment (90–120 days post implantation)
were reinjected with 5 � 105 untagged EMT6 cells in the fat pad. Animals were
euthanized as described above. Blinding or randomization was not possible.
All animal experiments were conducted with the approval of the University of
Ottawa Animal Care and Veterinary Service in accordance with guidelines
established by the Canadian Council on Animal Care.
Flow cytometry. For in vitro analysis, cells were treated with vehicle (0.01% DMSO)
or 5 mM LCL161 and 0.01% BSA, 1 ng ml� 1 TNF-a, 250 U ml� 1 IFN-b or 0.1 MOI
of VSVD51 for 24 hr. Cells were released from plates with enzyme-free dissociation
buffer (Gibco) and stained with Zombie Green and the indicated antibodies. For
analysis of tumour immune infiltrates, intracranial CT-2A tumours were mechani-
cally dissociated, RBCs lysed in ACK lysis buffer and stained with Zombie Green and
the indicated antibodies. In some cases, cells were stimulated with 5 ng ml� 1 PMA
and 500 ng ml� 1 Ionomycin in the presence of Brefeldin A for 5 h, and intracellular
antigens were processed using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm kit. Antibodies include Fc
Block (101319, 1:500), PD-L1 (10F.9G2, 1:250), PD-L2 (TY25, 1:100), I-A/I-E (M5/
114.15.2, 1:200) and H-2Kd/H-2Dd- (34-1-2S, 1:200), CD45 (30-F11, 1:300), CD3
(17A2, 1:500), CD4 (GK1.5, 1:500), CD8 (53-6.7, 1:500), PD-1 (29.1A12, 1:200),
CD25 (PC61, 1:150), Gr1 (RB6-AC5, 1:200), F4/80 (BM8, 1:200), GrzB (GB11,
1:150) and IFN-g (XMG1.2, 1:200). All antibodies were from BioLegend except for
TNF-a (MP6-XT22, 1:200) and CD11b (M1/70, 1:100) where from BD Biosciences.
Cells were analysed on a Cyan ADP 9 (Beckman Coulter) or BD Fortessa (BD
Biosciences) and data were analysed with FlowJo (Tree Star).
Microscopy. Detection of mKate2-CT-2A cells was performed in an incubator
outfitted with an Incucyte Zoom microscope equipped with a � 10 objective.
Enumeration of fluorescent signals from the Incucyte Zoom was processed using
the integrated object counting algorithm within the Incucyte Zoom software.

 Multiplex ELISA. The detection of serum proteins following combinatorial SMC
and anti-PD-1 treatment was analysed by a flow cytometry-based multiplex kit
(LEGENDplex inflammation panel from Biolegend). Hierarchical analysis was
determined using Morpheus (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus).
RT-qPCR. Total RNA from mice was isolated from mice treated with combinations
of LCL161 and anti-PD-1 using the RNAEasy Mini Plus Kit. Two step RT-qPCR
was performed using iScript and SsoAdvanced SYBR Green supermix (BioRad) on
a Mastercycler ep realplex (Eppendorf). The library panel of cytokine and
chemokine genes was from realtimeprimers.com. A n ¼ 4 was performed for each
treatment conditioned and data were normalized to eight different reference genes
and compared with each vehicle and IgG sample. The data were analysed by
hierarchical analysis using Morpheus.
ELISpot. CD8 þ T-cells were enriched from splenocytes of female age-matched
naive mice or mice previously cured of intracranial CT-2A (180 days
post-implantation) or mammary EMT6 tumours (120 days post-implantation)
using a CD8 magnetic selection kit (Stemcell Technologies). CD8 þ cells were
cocultured with cancer cells (1:20 for CT-2A, LLC, and 1:12.5 for EMT6 or 4T1
cells) and with 10 mg ml � 1 IgG (BE0091) or anti-PD-1 (J43) for 48 h using the
IFN-g or Granzyme B ELISpot kits (R&D Systems).
Statistical analysis. Comparison of Kaplan–Meier survival plots was conducted
by log-rank analysis and subsequent pairwise multiple comparisons were
performed using the Holm–Sidak method (SigmaPlot). Comparison between
multiple treatment groups was analysed using one-way ANOVA followed by
post hoc analysis using Dunnett’s multiple comparison test with adjustments for
multiple comparison (GraphPad). Estimate of variation was analysed with
GraphPad. Comparison of treatment pairs was analysed by two-sided t-tests
(GraphPad).
