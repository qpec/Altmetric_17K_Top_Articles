SUMMARY
Microglia play key roles in brain development, ho-
meostasis, and function, and it is widely assumed
that the adult population is long lived and maintained
by self-renewal. However, the precise temporal and
spatial dynamics of the microglial population are un-
known. We show in mice and humans that the turn-
over of microglia is remarkably fast, allowing the
whole population to be renewed several times during
a lifetime. The number of microglial cells remains
steady from late postnatal stages until aging and is
maintained by the spatial and temporal coupling of
proliferation and apoptosis, as shown by pulse-
chase studies, chronic in vivo imaging of microglia,
and the use of mouse models of dysregulated
apoptosis. Our results reveal that the microglial pop-
ulation is constantly and rapidly remodeled, expand-
ing our understanding of its role in the maintenance
of brain homeostasis.
INTRODUCTION
Microglial cells are the brain’s resident innate immune cells, with
proposed key roles in brain communication and the control of
inflammation in brain disease (Gomez-Nicola and Perry, 2015),
the developmental control of neurogenesis (Cunningham et al.,
2013), wiring (Squarzoni et al., 2014) and synaptic pruning (Pao-
licelli et al., 2011), the monitoring of synaptic activity (Wake et al.,
2009) and the regulation of adult neurogenesis (Sierra et al.,
2010). Microglia account for 5%–12% of the total number of glial
cells in the mouse brain (Lawson et al., 1990) and 0.5%–16.6% of
the total number of cells in the human brain (Mittelbronn et al.,
2001), depending on the region studied.
Microglia are derived from the yolk sac at embryonic day (E)
8.5 (Ginhoux et al., 2010), a lineage distinct from most other tis-
sue-resident macrophages (Hoeffel et al., 2015), and they ac-
quire their definitive local density soon after birth, after a wave
of microglial proliferation at early postnatal stages (Nikodemova
et al., 2015). However, it is unclear whether proliferation alone
can account for the rapid increase in microglial numbers and
suggests the possibility of additional recruitment and differentia-
tion from blood-derived monocytes perinatally (Ginhoux et al.,
2013), although the contribution of monocytes has not been
observed in fate mapping studies (Hoeffel et al., 2015; Sheng
et al., 2015).
In the adult, it has been suggested that the microglial popula-
tion is long lived and maintained by self-renewal (Lawson et al.,
1992), although the dynamics of the microglial population in
the adult brain are largely unknown. However, evidence arising
from manipulations of the numbers of resident microglial cells
highlights that this population can be rapidly reconstituted by
the proliferation of resident cells after genetic ablation by using
the Cx3cr1CreER-based system (Bruttger et al., 2015), by phar-
macological elimination (Elmore et al., 2014), or by infiltrating
monocytes after the death of microglia induced using the
CD11b-TK system (Varvel et al., 2012). Microglia are rarely re-
placed by bone marrow (BM)-derived progenitors in health or
disease (Gomez-Nicola and Perry, 2015). These observations
suggest that microglia resemble the behavior of other tissue-
resident macrophage populations, like lung or BM macro-
phages, which are maintained by self-renewal in the steady state
(Hashimoto et al., 2013). Although these studies suggest that mi-
croglia are a dynamic population and give some clues about the
molecular determinants of the repopulation response, we do not
know the rules governing the homeostatic maintenance of mi-
croglia during an organism’s lifetime.
In this study, we show that the adult microglial population is
formed without a contribution from circulating progenitors. We
show that in the adult mouse and human brain, microglia display
a high proliferation rate that accounts for several rounds of
renewal of the whole population during the organism’s lifetime.
This proliferation is temporally and spatially coupled to intrinsic
apoptosis, resulting in the maintenance of a relatively steady

 number of cells from early postnatal stages through to aging. Our
results reveal highly dynamic but tightly regulated control of mi-
croglial cell numbers, expanding our understanding of the func-
tions of microglia in the healthy and diseased brain.
RESULTS
A Perinatal Wave of Infiltrating Monocytes Does Not
Contribute to the Adult Microglial Population
Although evidence supports the concept that the adult microglial
population is generated from yolk sac emigrants (Ginhoux et al.,
2010), followed by a wave of microglial proliferation (Nikode-
mova et al., 2015), it is unclear whether this alone accounts for
the total increase in microglial cell numbers. Contrasting reports
described the infiltration of blood-derived monocytes into the
brain at perinatal stages (Alliot et al., 1999; Tambuyzer et al.,
2009), although monocytes have been shown not to contribute
to the adult microglial population (Hoeffel et al., 2015; Sheng
et al., 2015). To address this question, we used an approach to
label and track hematopoietic cells during embryonic develop-
ment that is based on the in utero intra-liver delivery of lentiviral
LeGO vectors driving the expression of the fluorescent protein
Venus at E14, a stage when the liver is the main hematopoietic
organ (Figure 1A). This method allows rapid, selective, and mini-
mally invasive tracing of cells from the hematopoietic lineage and
further analysis in target organs. Intra-liver tracing at E14 and
subsequent analysis of the brain from postnatal day (P) 0 onward
allowed the visualization of waves of infiltrating monocytes
(Venus+), acquiring migratory phenotypes (bipolar, elongated;
87.9% of all Venus+ cells at P3) or ramified phenotypes (multiple
radially orientated processes; 12.0% of all Venus+ cells at P3)
within the brain’s parenchyma (Figures 1B and 1C). The visuali-
zation of the differentiation of Venus+ cells into ramified Iba1-
expressing morphologies supported the use of this tracking
method for long-term purposes, because the expression of the
Venus transgene was not affected by phenotypic changes with
postnatal age (Figure 1C). Venus+ cells were not found in the
perivascular space of the blood vessels or in the meninges.
This, together with the morphologies observed in Figure 1C, sup-
ports that Venus+ cells infiltrate the parenchyma proper. The
quantification of the total Venus+ cells (ramified + migratory) (Fig-
ures 1B and 1C) showed the time course of infiltration (Figures
1D and 1E). This wave of infiltration was coincident in time
with the expansion of the resident microglial population
(Iba1+Venus�) followed by further refinement (Figure 1D), in
accordance with previously reported data (Nikodemova et al.,
2015). After a peak of infiltration at P3, the infiltrated monocytes
were found to radically decrease in number until only rare cells
survive in the adult brain (Figure 1E). These cells were not
observed when vectors were delivered to the amniotic sac,
supporting the specificity of the intra-liver approach. Intra-liver
injections were comparable in different litters, as shown by a
comparable degree of labeling of Kupffer cells and hepatocytes
in the liver (Figure 1F), preserved over time. Venus+ cells in the
brain parenchyma were identified at P3 to be CD206low when
compared with choroid plexus or perivascular macrophages
(Figure 1G) and GFAP�Olig2�NG2� (Figure 1H), supporting their
monocytic lineage. Venus+ cells were also defined as non-prolif-
erative cells (Venus+ bromodeoxyuridine [BrdU]�) in the different
regions analyzed (Figure 1I).
The analysis of cell death in the Venus+ population revealed an
apoptotic response from P3, as identified by the expression of
cleaved caspase-3 or chromatin condensation (non-significant
difference between activated caspase-3+ cells versus cells
with condensed nuclei stained with DAPI) (Figure 1J). We found
that at P3, 1.83% (condensed DAPI) or 3.17% (act-caspase-3+)
of Venus+ cells were apoptotic, with small variations across re-
gions. Other cells, mostly neurons, were also found to be acti-
vated caspase-3+ (Figure 1K) because of postnatal circuitry
refinement. Given that the average time for an apoptotic cell to
be removed from the brain is about 80 min (Sierra et al., 2013),
and assuming that the clearance rates remain constant until
adulthood, we estimated that the infiltrated monocytes could
be removed from the brain parenchyma within approximately
42–72 hr. Although this is an estimation based on the mean
rate of observed apoptosis, it helps explain the drop in Venus+
cell numbers detected from P3 to P6 (Figure 1E).
In light of these data, we conclude that the adult microglial
population is composed exclusively from yolk sac-derived cells,
without the contribution of hematopoietic-derived monocytes
infiltrating at perinatal stages.
The Number of Microglial Cells Remains Stable
throughout Life in Mice and Humans
We next investigated the regional and temporal changes in the
number of microglial cells in a select number of brain regions
to understand their population dynamics. The density of murine
microglial cells (Iba1+) remained remarkably stable throughout,
with little change from the young (4–6 months) to the aged (18–
24 months) brains in all areas analyzed except the thalamus,
where an increased number was found with aging (Figure 2A).
Microglial cells were denser in gray matter-enriched versus white
matter-enriched areas, as previously shown (Lawson et al.,
1990). To better understand whether the maintenance of micro-
glial numbers was achieved by local self-renewal or by a contri-
bution from circulating monocytes, we compared the microglial
density in young versus aged CCR2�/� and wild-type (WT)
mice. CCR2�/� monocytes have deficient egress from the
bone marrow, leading to fewer circulating monocytes (Serbina
and Pamer, 2006) and making them a valuable model in
which to study the role of recruited monocytes (Gomez-Nicola
and Perry, 2015). The contribution of patrolling monocytes
(CX3CR1+/CCR2�) was not studied by our approach and cannot
be excluded, although these cells have been shown to infiltrate
the CNS only under pathological conditions (Shechter et al.,
2013). Neither young nor aged CCR2�/� mice had a different

 number of microglial cells when compared to WT mice (Fig-
ure 2B), suggesting that circulating monocytes do not contribute
significantly to the microglial population during a healthy lifetime.
A similar picture was observed when we compared young (20–
35 years old) versus aged (58–76 years old) human cases. The
density of microglia in the gray or white matter of the temporal
cortex was found to be unchanged with aging (Figure 2C). Micro-
glial cell density was greater in the white matter than in the
gray matter (Figures 2C and 2D), in agreement with previous
findings (Mittelbronn et al., 2001). This pattern of distribution
opposes that previously found in rodents (Lawson et al., 1990),
indicating species-specific regional differences in the microglial
population.
Altogether, these data demonstrate that the density of micro-
glial cells is remarkably stable in young and aged brains from
both mice and humans.
The analysis of microglia in aged mice led to the identification
of small numbers of multinucleated microglial aggregates (Fig-
ure 2E), previously described in the aged rat brain (Perry et al.,
1993). Multinucleated microglial aggregates were more frequent
in the aged thalamus and cerebellum (Figure S1A) and ex-
pressed major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class
II) (Figure S1B), as well as CD45 (data not shown). Using
confocal microscopy, we could identify aggregates containing
up to ten nuclei within the same cytoplasmic syncytium (Fig-
ure S1C). To better understand whether failed cytokinesis after
increased proliferation was the origin of these aggregates, we
performed analysis of proliferation after repeated BrdU incor-
poration using confocal microscopy (Figure S1D). The incor-
poration of BrdU was minimal in these aggregates (0.48%
were BrdU+ and showed only two cells per aggregate) (Fig-
ure S1D), ruling out the hypothesis of failed cytokinesis. Our
next hypothesis was that these aggregates could have a periph-
eral origin, which was confirmed after observing that aged
CCR2�/� mice were devoid of multinucleated microglial aggre-
gates (Figure 2F).
Microglia Have a High Proliferation Rate in the Mouse
and Human Brain
Although it is often assumed that the microglial population is
maintained by a slow turnover of long-lived resident cells, little
formal evidence exists (reviewed in Gomez-Nicola and Perry,
2015). Earlier work from Lawson et al. (1992), using H3 thymidine
combined with immunohistochemistry for F4/80, demonstrated

 that microglia proliferate in the healthy brain but do so more
slowly than other tissue macrophages: 0.05% of the microglia
were proliferating at a given time, 20 times less than the lowest
labeling index for any other resident macrophage populations
studied (Lawson et al., 1992). We set out to analyze the prolifer-
ation of resident microglia by using more sensitive techniques
(BrdU incorporation detected in Iba1+ cells by double immuno-
histochemistry of diaminobenzidine [DAB] and alkaline phospha-
tase [AP]) (Olmos-Alonso et al., 2016). We found that microglial
proliferation rates in the adult brain were approximately ten times
higher (Figures 3A–3C) than those previously reported by Law-
son et al. (1992). On average, 0.69% of the total microglial cells
were proliferating (Iba1+BrdU+) after a single pulse of BrdU. This
rate was particularly high in the dentate gyrus (DG), the only area
where we also found that aging had an impact on the prolifera-
tion rate (Figures 3A–3C). We ensured that these rates were
not underestimated by the dose of BrdU, because we had per-
formed a dose-response analysis of microglial proliferation
confirming that the BrdU dose (7.5 mg/mL) used was optimal
(Figures S2A and S2B). We next performed a time-course anal-
ysis of proliferation and division after a single pulse of BrdU in
microglial cells (Figure 3B). In the cortex, we could detect the
duplication of the proliferating population from 16 hr after the
BrdU pulse, indicating successful cell-cycle exit and cell division
(Figure 3B). Return to the baseline number of Iba1+BrdU+ cells
was observed from 24 hr. Considering that the S phase of
mammalian cells comprises �50% of the duration of the cell
cycle, with G2/M only taking a few hours (Cameron and Greulich,
1963), this allows an estimate of a cell-cycle length (Tc) of 32 hr.
This would be in agreement with reported cell-cycle lengths of
macrophages, which vary depending on the differentiation stage
from 20 to 40 hr (Kueh et al., 2013). If the S phase spans �50% of
the cell-cycle length, our data from BrdU labeling would only
detect half of the dividing population. This indicates that
�1.38% of the population will be proliferating at a given time
(F = fraction of cells in a cell cycle). If we use these rates to calcu-
late the time needed for the entire rodent microglial population to
renew (X), with the equation
X = 100xTc
F
we can estimate that the population renews once every 2,318 hr
(�96 days), allowing as many as six cycles of complete renewal
during an animal’s lifetime (average 21 months). However, these
calculations are based on estimations of Tc and require further
specific study.
The proliferative cycle was quicker in the DG, where the initial
duplication returned to baseline before 24 hr (Figure 3B). In
addition to revealing the higher proliferative activity of microglia
in the DG, these data strongly suggest that microglial death
must be tightly temporally and spatially coupled to proliferation
to maintain the stable density of microglial cells, as discussed
later.
Higher figures were observed when analyzing the proliferation
of human microglia (on average, 2% of the microglial population
proliferating at a given time), according to double staining of Iba1
and Ki67 (Figures 3D and 3E). This rate is 2.9 times higher than
that observed for mice described earlier (0.69%). However,
Ki67 expression is not directly comparable to BrdU incorpora-
tion. This difference might be explained by how Ki67 would label
not only the S phase but also other cell-cycle phases except G0.
This means the labeling of Ki67 is approximately two times
higher than that of BrdU (Kee et al., 2002), which only labels
the S phase, comprising �50% of the duration of the cell cycle
(Cameron and Greulich, 1963). If cell-cycle length remains con-
stant in mammals (32 hr, as noted earlier), this would allow an
estimation of hundreds of cycles of complete renewal during a
lifetime (average 80 years).
To further explore age-related changes in microglial prolifera-
tion, we studied the expression of genes related to the
colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R)-driven proliferative
response (Go
´ mez-Nicola et al., 2013). We found a significant
reduction in the expression of PU.1 and IRF8 in aging brains
and a non-significant trend toward a reduction in relevant genes
like CSF1, CSF1R, C/EBPa, CD34, or RUNX1 (Figure S3). To
further address the significance of the CSF1R pathway in con-
trolling microglial turnover, we administered young mice a diet
containing GW2580, a specific CSF1R inhibitor previously
shown to cause blockade of microglial proliferation, but not mi-
croglia survival (Go
´ mez-Nicola et al., 2013; Uitdehaag et al.,
2011; De Lucia et al., 2016; Olmos-Alonso et al., 2016), in
contrast to the microglia-depleting effects caused by the
CSF1R inhibitor PLX3397 (Elmore et al., 2014). Treatment with
GW2580 for 3 months decreased the total number of microglial
cells (PU.1+) by 17% (Figures 3F and 3G), supporting the rele-
vance of the CSF1R pathway in controlling the homeostatic
maintenance of microglial turnover.

 To provide an independent method to validate our analysis of
microglial proliferation in mice, we took advantage of the ability
of g-retroviral vectors to selectively transduce proliferating glial
cells (Gomez-Nicola et al., 2014). We delivered an Eco-SFFV
g-retroviral vector driving the expression of mCherry to the
lateral ventricle of CSF1R promotor (c-fms) EGFP mice, allowing
diffusion to adjacent areas (cortex and striatum) due to the
initially injected volume (5 mL) (Figure 3H). We analyzed the incor-
poration of Eco-SFFV-RV (retroviral vector) mCherry 3 days after
injection to allow the expression of detectable levels of mCherry
(Gomez-Nicola et al., 2014) and the potential visualization of
pairs of cells before postdivision microglial death (Figure 3B).
We found a limited number of microglial cells (EGFP+) expressing
mCherry, presenting as typical microglial duplets (Figure 3I). The
quantification of proliferating microglial cells (mCherry+EGFP+)
offered a proliferation rate (Figure 3J) similar to that previously
described by analyzing the incorporation of BrdU in Iba1 cells
(Figure 3A), validating our previous findings.
For direct visualization of microglial turnover, we used chronic
live imaging of the olfactory bulb microglia in CX3CR1GFP/+ mice,
coupled to repeated blood vessel imaging (Figure S4A) (Koval-
chuk et al., 2015). To control for potential interference of the im-
plantation of the chronic window on the microglial behavior, mice
were analyzed 3–4 weeks after surgery to allow initial inflamma-
tion to resolve. After this, imaged microglia were typical highly
branched, CD11blow and CD68� (Figures S4B and S4C), and
therefore considered surveillant microglia. Repeated live imag-
ing of microglia allowed the identification of cell division (duplica-
tion) (Figure 3K) or death (disappearance) (see Figure 6A later)
and defined the proliferation rate of microglia at 0.79% per day
(Figure 3L), similar to the rate we found with Iba1/BrdU staining
(Figure 3A). During the first 24 hr after division, paired microglia
were found at a significantly closer distance than resident non-
dividing microglia (Figure 3M), suggesting that these cells were
generated from the same proliferating cell. During the following
days, the cells migrated away from each other and reached
cell-to-cell dispersion similar to the rest of the microglial popula-
tion within 3–4 days (Figure 3N). These data confirm the high
rates of microglial proliferation detected by Iba1/BrdU staining
and suggest that the territories occupied by microglia change
upon cell division, probably affecting the performance of local
homeostatic functions.
Thus, using three independent lines of evidence, our data
show that microglia proliferate in the adult mouse and human
brain at a high rate, allowing several cycles of renewal of the
whole population during the organism’s lifetime.
Microglial Turnover Is Not Maintained by Nestin+
Precursors
In light of findings suggesting that Nestin+ microglial precursors
may be involved in the repopulation response after pharmaco-
logical microglial ablation (Elmore et al., 2014) or transgenic
microglial ablation (Bruttger et al., 2015), we aimed to study
whether microglial proliferation in the steady state was main-
tained by a subpopulation of stem cell-like microglia. We
analyzed Nestin-GFP mice as an optimal reporter mouse for
the expression of nestin (Mignone et al., 2004), and although
we showed the previously reported expression in pericytes (Fig-
ures 4A–4C), neural stem cells (Figure 4B), and oligodendrocyte
precursor cells (Figures 4A and 4C) (Mignone et al., 2004), we did
not find evidence of nestin expression in microglia (Iba1+) (Fig-
ures 4A–4C). We specifically studied the expression of nestin
in proliferating microglia (Iba1+BrdU+; 24 hr postinjection) and
found no evidence of nestin+ microglia (Figure 4D). We therefore
conclude that microglial proliferation is not maintained by
Nestin+ microglial precursors in the steady state.
Microglial Proliferation and Apoptosis Are Temporally
and Spatially Coupled to Maintain Microglial
Homeostasis
The time-course analysis of microglial proliferation (Figure 3B)
suggested that microglial cell death plays a key role in maintain-
ing the stable number of microglia over time. Given the diffi-
culties of analyzing microglial apoptosis by traditional methods
(Sierra et al., 2013), we set out to address this point by using
live imaging of microglia in CX3CR1GFP/+ mice. Under these con-
ditions, microglial death is defined as a disappearance of a cell
within the network of relatively immobile neighboring cells (Fig-
ure 5A), with the blood vessel pattern providing additional land-
marks. The death rate of resident microglia was found to be
1.23% per day, while the death rate for newborn (recently
divided) microglia was 2.40% (Figure 5B). For newborn micro-
glial cells, the death rate was highest during the first 5 days after
division (5.0% ± 3.5%), significantly higher than the death rate in
the resident adult cell population.
To further study the relevance of microglial apoptosis in the
maintenance of the population, we studied the numbers of mi-
croglia in three mouse models defective in intrinsic apoptosis
(PUMA�/�, BIM�/�, and Vav-Bcl2). While the first two have ubiq-
uitous deletion of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology domain 3
(BH3)-only molecules PUMA or BIM, the Vav-Bcl2 mice have
the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl2 overexpressed only in cells of
the myeloid lineage. When compared to WT mice, both BIM�/�
and Vav-Bcl2 mice were found to have a significant increase in
the number of microglial cells (Figure 5C). PUMA�/� showed
no difference, or even a reduction, in the number of microglia
(Figure 5C), in agreement with previous findings in the eye
(Zhang et al., 2012) and suggesting that microglial apoptosis is
PUMA independent. Because Vav-Bcl2 mice provide a robust
block in intrinsic apoptosis only in lymphoid and myeloid lineage
cells (Egle et al., 2004), which in the brain is restricted to micro-
glia, we decided to focus on the study of this model (Figure 5D).
A time course of postnatal development of the microglial popu-
lation in Vav-Bcl2 mice showed that the increase in the number
of microglial cells is reached early in life (P44) and remains stable
until middle age (before the onset of other health defects) (Fig-
ures 5E and 5F) (Egle et al., 2004). This stabilization of increased
density, caused by deficient microglial apoptosis, is perhaps ex-
plained by the inability of the parenchyma to accommodate
more cells, suggesting contact inhibition mechanisms are in
place.
To understand the impact of apoptosis blockade on microglial
phenotype, we isolated microglia by flow cytometry analysis
and sorting (FACS) and analyzed their transcriptomic profile
by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (Figure 6). Flow cytometry
analysis showed a significant increase in the population of

 CD11b+CD45high cells in Vav-Bcl2 mice when compared to
WT littermates (Figure 6A), identifying this subpopulation of
microglia as the biggest contributor to increased numbers
observed previously. Isolation of CD11b+CD45low and CD11b+
CD45high subpopulations from WT and Vav-Bcl2 followed by
RNA-seq profiling rendered a total of 137 genes statistically
(p < 0.01; fold change > 10) upregulated in Vav-Bcl2 versus
WT and 259 genes statistically downregulated in Vav-Bcl2
versus WT microglia (Figure 6B; Table S1). Gene Ontology anal-
ysis revealed that differentially expressed genes were particu-
larly associated with gene ontology (GO) Slim terms involved in
metabolic processes and biogenesis (Figure 6C). Clustering of
GO terms (based on genes shared between each GO category)

revealed GO processes previously identi-
fied to be upregulated in microglia (Gra-
bert et al., 2016), including immune
response and macromolecule biosyn-
thesis (Figure 6D). Vav-Bcl2 mice also
showed a significant alteration of genes
clustered under the processes of the
cell cycle, proliferation, and death, con-
firming the expected effects of Bcl-2 up-
regulation (Figure 6C). Vav-Bcl2 microglia
had significant repression (>200-fold) of
the pro-apoptotic gene Bad and signifi-
cant upregulation (17-fold) of the anti-
apoptotic
gene
Api5
(Table
S1).
In
addition, Vav-Bcl2 microglia showed sig-
nificant repression of cell-cycle-promot-
ing genes like Mad2l1, Mdm2, Cdca3,
Cdk1, Cdc20, and Cdc20b (all > 25-
fold downregulated) (Table S1). These
changes confirm the anti-apoptotic ef-
fects of Bcl-2 overexpression in microglia
but also
suggest
impaired
cell-cycle
regulation as an associated effect. A
Venn diagram showing the relations be-
tween the gene sets of CD45low and
CD45high identifies the CD11b+CD45low
subpopulation as the major contributor
to the transcriptional variability observed
between WT and Vav-Bcl2 microglia
(Figure 6E).
Although Vav-Bcl2 mice had significant alteration in the num-
ber and phenotype of microglia through most of their adult life,
they did not display gross deficiencies in the astrocyte popula-
tions (Figure S5A) or the neuronal populations (Figure S5B) and
only showed minor differences in age-dependent changes in
synaptic density (Figure S5C). Vav-Bcl2 mice showed no differ-
ences in behavioral performance when compared to WT mice
(Figures S6A and S6B).
We next analyzed the temporal and spatial relationship be-
tween death and proliferation events in vivo. We observed rapid
reorganization of the microglial landscape (Figure 7A). This is
exemplified by the representation of the history of microglia dur-
ing the 22-day-long imaging period in a sample field of view, with

 stable cells shown in gray, cells going to die shown in red, and
cells going to divide shown in blue (Figure 7B). Microglial prolif-
eration and apoptosis were spatially and temporally coupled,
because many more cells proliferated in the vicinity (%200 mm)
of a dying cell immediately after its death (Figure 7C). Some of
the proliferating cells were immediately adjacent to the dying
cells, whereas others were located more distantly (Figures 7B
and 7D). The median distance between the dying and the nearest
proliferating cell was 72.95 ± 43.13 mm (n = 19 cell pairs), almost
double the distance between the dying and the nearest resident
cell (37.94 ± 11.74 mm, n = 31 cell pairs) (Figures 7D and 7E).
Overall, proliferating cells were found to be the second-closest
neighbors to dying cells.
In summary, our data indicate that the microglial population
undergoes constant and rapid remodeling based on temporal
and spatial coupling of proliferation and apoptosis, providing a
mechanism for the homeostasis of the population through life.
This constant renewal causes not only the individual cellular
players to change but also their spatial layout to be rapidly
modified.

 DISCUSSION
During the last decade, the study of microglial cells and neuroin-
flammation has experienced a revolution. Minimally invasive
methods have revealed microglia to be highly dynamic in their
interaction with the microenvironment, responding to inflamma-
tory signals (Nimmerjahn et al., 2005; Davalos et al., 2005) and
interacting with neuronal circuits at the synaptic level (Tremblay
et al., 2010; Wake et al., 2009). Microglia can sculpt the brain and
affect its physiology, because they have been observed to
contain phagocytic inclusions with features of axonal terminals,

dendritic spines, or unneeded neuronal
progenitors (Tremblay et al., 2010; Paoli-
celli et al., 2011; Sierra et al., 2010). Our
data demonstrate that microglial cells
are actively renewed and that the brain
population is maintained by a finely tuned
balance of proliferation and apoptosis.
It has long been assumed that microglia are long-lived cells. At
the population level, microglia are long lived, but at the individual
cell level, they are not. The microglial landscape changes radi-
cally within a few weeks, with cells dying, other taking their place,
and their absolute position changing. This renewing landscape
will likely influence the interpretation of phenomena such as mi-
croglial priming, in which the microglial response is exaggerated
(stronger than that observed in stimulus-naive microglia) to a
secondary insult. This is perhaps best illustrated when the first
(priming) and second stimuli are separated by prolonged periods
of time in the context of adult responses to early-life infections

 (Bilbo and Schwarz, 2009), delayed inflammation after traumatic
brain injury (TBI) (Johnson et al., 2013), or the onset of age-
related amyloid deposition after gestational inflammation (Krstic
et al., 2012). There, microglial priming implies the need for a ‘‘mi-
croglial memory’’ of the first stimulus to elicit an exaggerated
response to the second stimulus. We suggest that our findings
could either support the hypothesis that microglial priming is
achieved through epigenetic (inheritable) changes (Schwarz
et al., 2011) or suggest that microglia memory could be stored
elsewhere in the neural or glial network. We believe that the pa-
rameters defined here will stimulate a reinterpretation of many of
the functions of microglia in health and disease.
That adult microglial population is maintained at least partly by
self-renewal has been largely assumed for more than 2 decades,
since our group reported on the proliferation of resident micro-
glia (Lawson et al., 1992). Using [3H]-thymidine incorporation
and detection with autoradiography, Lawson et al. (1992)
described a very low turnover rate for microglia, with �0.05%
of the cells dividing at a time. Although a probable underestima-
tion, acknowledged at the time due to the relative insensitivity of
the method, these studies were never revisited using the gold
standard in the field: incorporation of BrdU. We now show, using
three independent methods, that the proliferation index of micro-
glia is much higher than expected (more than ten times higher),
and an average of 0.69% microglial cells are in S phase at a given
time. This rate would allow for an estimation of the brain’s micro-
glial population being renewed every �95 days, allowing several
cycles of renewal within the lifetime of a mouse. Higher rates are
found in the human brain (average 2%), with a more dramatic
consequence on the turnover cycles, leading to estimates that
microglia would cycle hundreds of times during 80 years of life.
However, the estimation of the turnover rate of human microglia
would need alternative methods to provide a more accurate
calculation and allow extrapolation to the average human
population.
This homeostatic microglial proliferation is balanced by the
opposing force of microglial apoptosis. The apoptotic cascade
controlling microglial death seems to be dependent on the pro-
apoptotic molecule BIM but not PUMA, as shown from the
analysis of knockout (KO) mice. A report demonstrated that defi-
ciency in PUMA leads to decreased numbers of both retinal and
brain microglia because of unexpected roles of this protein in
promoting cell survival (Zhang et al., 2012), consistent with our
present findings showing a decreased density of microglia in
PUMA�/� mice. Microglial death can be counteracted by the
inhibition of mitochondrial apoptosis as indicated by the overex-
pression of Bcl2, leading to increased microglial numbers. Sur-
prisingly, our results support the hypothesis that the brain can
only accommodate certain number of microglial cells, because
deficient microglial death causes the increased microglial
numbers to plateau after postnatal development. In the normal
brain, the microglial population displays a mosaic-like organiza-
tion in which processes of individual cells avoid contact with one
another, being disrupted only with the emergence of changes
related to pathology, age, or systemic influences (Gomez-Nicola
and Perry, 2015). Transcriptomic profiling of microglia from Vav-
Bcl2 mice highlights profound alterations of their functional
profile, including altered metabolism and immune response,
providing a link between homeostatic microglial apoptosis and
phenotypic profile. A more detailed future study of the mecha-
nisms by which altered microglia turnover could affect basic mi-
croglia functions, including those controlling their inflammatory
properties, will provide valuable insights into understanding the
maintenance of the microglial population in health and disease.
The sub-regional analysis of microglial turnover highlighted
the DG as a particularly active anatomical region. In the DG, mi-
croglial proliferation is higher, is quicker, and decays more
rapidly with age. An age-dependent decrease in proliferation is
also observed in the population of DG neural progenitors (Kuhn
et al., 1996), and this can be correlated with the decrease of mi-
croglial proliferation, because microglial phagocytosis of pro-
genitors is coupled to neurogenic activity (Sierra et al., 2010).
Thus, aging would lead to a decrease in DG microglial prolifera-
tion indirectly, through a decline in neurogenesis. A more direct
effect of aging on microglia residing within the DG would imply
microglial senescence. Replicative senescence, the loss of
mitotic potential accompanied by significant telomere short-
ening, occurs once a cell has undergone approximately 50 rep-
lications, the so-called Hayflick limit (Hayflick, 1965). Thus, we
hypothesize that the increased microglial turnover in the DG
will lead to a quicker extinction of the proliferative capacity of
these cells, as observed in our data. The microglial population
at the DG seems particularly susceptible to telomere shortening,
as highlighted using a mouse model of telomere dysfunction
(telomerase RNA component [TERC] KO) (Khan et al., 2015),
supporting the hypothesis that increased microglial division
can lead to replicative senescence.
In an attempt to reconcile conflicting evidence about the
contribution of circulating monocytes to the composition of the
microglial population at perinatal stages (Ginhoux et al., 2013),
we developed a cell-tracking approach based on the intra-liver
tracing of embryonic hematopoiesis. Our results support the ex-
istence of a wave of monocytes that infiltrate the brain, peaking
at P3, but indicate that these are rapidly depleted by apoptosis
and do not contribute to the final microglial population, which
we can now confirm is exclusively formed by yolk sac-derived
progenitors. The elimination of infiltrated macrophages is coinci-
dent with a wave of microglial proliferation, followed by a further
selection process before the final number of cells is achieved
(Nikodemova et al., 2015). The functional significance of this
wave of liver-derived monocytes is unknown, and should be
the subject of future research, but the temporal coincidence
with the refinement of the microglial numbers prompts specula-
tion that these cells could trigger the death of a subpopulation of
yolk sac-derived microglia.
The changes in microglial morphology that occur during aging
are well documented; however, a particular morphological
change that has received little attention to date is the formation
of giant, multinucleated microglial aggregates in aged mice,
such as those observed in our study. Previous studies have
shown that microglia form aggregates with multiple nuclei, which
can include more than 20 individual cells, under certain inflam-
matory conditions (Fendrick et al., 2007; Perry et al., 1993).
Our data show that these aggregates are not generated by failed
cytokinesis after division. Similar structures are observed in the
context of a repopulation paradigm after genetic ablation of
402
Cell Reports 18, 391–405, January 10, 2017
 microglia (Bruttger et al., 2015). However, these clusters are
BrdU+ (Bruttger et al., 2015), transient, and not fused, suggesting
they serve as pools of repopulating microglia, whereas we here
observe a fusion or aggregation of groups of cells. Given the ter-
ritorial nature and lack of contact between microglial cells in
younger brains, this is seen as an aberrant morphological devel-
opment and represents a significant change in the phenotype
and function of microglia in aging. With our data, we can provide
clear evidence that these aggregates likely originate from the
incorporation of circulating monocytes into the brain paren-
chyma, but further research is needed to fully understand their
function.
One question raised by our data relates to the molecular regu-
lation of the self-renewal process. We provide evidence for a
necessary, but not sufficient, role of CSF1R in controlling micro-
glial turnover in homeostasis, as shown from our mRNA studies
and from the pharmacological inhibition of the CSF1R tyrosine
kinase activity with GW2580. Elimination of microglia can be
achieved by acute treatment with a highly potent CSF1R/c-kit/
FLT3/PDGFRb inhibitor, highlighting the relevance of these re-
ceptors in maintaining microglial numbers (Elmore et al., 2014).
However, other systems may have to be in place to fully control
microglial turnover. Recent studies, using genetic ablation of mi-
croglia, show that interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) plays a crucial
role in the replenishment process (Bruttger et al., 2015). Although
a repopulation process cannot be compared to the homeostatic
maintenance of the microglial population, complementary sys-
tems (CSF1R, IL-1R, or others) must be in place to ensure the
stability of this important population of non-neuronal cells in
the CNS.
In light of the current data, we conclude that the turnover of
the microglial population is a highly dynamic process, made
possible by the finely tuned temporal and spatial balance of mi-
croglial proliferation and apoptosis. Our data question the view
of microglia as a long-lived population, almost never renewed
in the adult brain, and propose a more dynamic scenario, which
will help uncover the key microglial functions in the healthy and
the diseased brain.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Experimental Mice
All experimental procedures were either approved by a local ethical review
committee and conducted in accordance with personal and project licenses
under the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986) or performed in accor-
dance with institutional animal welfare guidelines and were approved by the
government of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany. Details of experimental mice
can be found in the Supplemental Information.
To analyze cell proliferation, mice received injections of intraperitoneal (i.p.)
BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich; 7.5 mg/mL, 0.1 mL/10 g weight in sterile saline). A dose-
response experiment was performed using 3.75, 7.5, or 15 mg/mL BrdU.
Postmortem Human Brain Samples
For immunohistochemical analysis, human brain autopsy tissue samples
(n = 15 per group) (temporal cortex, paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed, 96%
formic acid-treated, 6 mm sections) from the National CJD Surveillance Unit
Brain Bank were obtained from Alzheimer’s disease or variant Creutzfeldt-
Jakob disease (vCJD) non-diseased age- and sex-matched young (age
20–35) or aged (age 58–79) controls, from whom consent for use of autopsy
tissues for research had been obtained. Ethical permission for research on
autopsy materials stored in the National CJD Surveillance Unit was obtained
from Lothian Region Ethics Committee.
In Utero Intra-liver Tracing of Embryonic Hematopoiesis
Cell tracking was performed by the administration of VSVG-SFFV-Venus or
VSVG-SFFV-mCherry lentiviral vectors. Details on the design, production,
and application of these vectors can be found in the Supplemental Information.
Chronic Cranial Window Implantation
The chronic cranial window was installed as previously described (Kovalchuk
et al., 2015). A detailed description of the method can be found in the Supple-
mental Information.
Two-Photon Imaging
Microglia expressing EGFP in the olfactory bulb (OB) of CX3CR1GFP/+ mice
were imaged once a day for 10 to 22 days by means of two-photon micro-
scopy. Details of the method can be found in the Supplemental Information.
Immunohistochemistry
Coronal hippocampal sections were cut from paraformaldehyde-fixed, frozen,
or fresh brains. Mice perfusion, tissue processing, and immunohistochemical
analysis were performed as previously described (Go
´ mez-Nicola et al., 2013),
with details found in the Supplemental Information.
Statistical Analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± SEM and analyzed with the GraphPad Prism 5
software package. When normality and homoscedasticity assumptions were
reached, we applied the two-tailed Fisher t test, one-way or two-way
ANOVA, followed by the Tukey post hoc test for multiple comparisons. For
the analysis of two-photon imaging for normally distributed data, mean ±
SEM was calculated, and the Student’s t test was used for comparison of
two groups. For data that were not normally distributed, median ± 1 interquar-
tile range was presented as a boxplot, and 10 to 90 percentiles were shown as
whiskers. For comparisons between non-parametrically distributed groups,
we used the Mann-Whitney test. The Wilcoxon matched pairs test was used
for nonparametric comparison of two paired groups. All statistical tests were
two sided. Differences were considered significant for p < 0.05.
