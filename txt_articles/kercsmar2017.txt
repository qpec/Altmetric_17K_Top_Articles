IMPORTANCE Asthma is the most common chronic condition of childhood. Hospitalizations
and emergency department (ED) visits for asthma are more frequently experienced by
minority children and adolescents and those with low socioeconomic status.
OBJECTIVE To reduce asthma-related hospitalizations and ED visits for Medicaid-insured
pediatric patients residing in Hamilton County, Ohio.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2015, a
multidisciplinary team used quality-improvement methods and the chronic care model to
conduct interventions in inpatient, outpatient, and community settings in a large, urban
academic pediatric hospital in Hamilton County, Ohio. Children and adolescents aged 2 to 17
years who resided in Hamilton County, had a diagnosis of asthma, and were Medicaid insured
were studied.
INTERVENTIONS Interventions were implemented in 3 phases: hospital-based inpatient care
redesign, outpatient-based care enhancements, and community-based supports.
Plan-do-study-act cycles allowed for small-scale implementation of change concepts and
rapid evaluation of how such tests affected processes and outcomes of interest.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The study measured asthma-related hospitalizations and ED
visits per 10 000 Medicaid-insured pediatric patients. Data were measured monthly on a rolling
12-month mean basis. Data from multiple previous years were used to establish a baseline. Data
were tracked with annotated control charts and with interrupted time-series analysis.
RESULTS Of the estimated 36 000 children and adolescents with asthma in Hamilton County
(approximately 13 000 of whom are Medicaid insured and 6000 of whom are cared for in
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital primary care practices), asthma-related hospitalizations decreased
from 8.1 (95% CI, 7.7-8.5) to 4.7 (95% CI, 4.3-5.1) per 10 000 Medicaid patients per month by
June 30, 2014, a 41.8% (95% CI, 41.7%-42.0%) relative reduction. Emergency department visits
decreased from 21.5 (95% CI, 20.6-22.3) to 12.4 (95% CI, 11.5-13.2) per 10 000 Medicaid patients
per month by June 30, 2014, a 42.4% (95% CI, 42.2%-42.6%) relative reduction. Improvements
were sustained for the subsequent 12 months. The proportion of patients who were
rehospitalized or had a return ED visit for asthma within 30 days of an index hospitalization was
reduced from 12% to 7%. The proportion of patients with documented well-controlled asthma in
this study’s primary care population increased from 48% to 54%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE An integrated, multilevel approach focused on enhancing
availability and accessibility of treatments, removing barriers to adherence, mitigating
multidomain risks, augmenting self-management, and creating a collaborative relationship
between the family and the health care system was associated with improved asthma
outcomes for a population of Medicaid-insured pediatric patients. Similar models used in
accountable care organizations or across patient panels and with other chronic conditions
could be feasible and warrant evaluation.

 P
ediatric asthma is a common, complex chronic condi-
tion. In 2010, asthma accounted for 14.2 million phy-
sician office visits and medical expenses of $50.1 bil-
lionperyear.1Hospitalizationsandemergencydepartment(ED)
visits have historically been used to measure asthma morbid-
ity.Riskfactorsforsuchpotentiallypreventablehealthcareuse
include minority race, low socioeconomic status, financial or
socialhardships,andlivinginasingle-parenthousehold.2-4For
example, minority children have hospitalization and ED visit
rates 3 times greater than white children.5,6
Successful long-term asthma management can be chal-
lenging; medications may be taken several times a day using
complicated devices. Patients and caregivers may have diffi-
culty comprehending instructions delivered during clinical
care, complicating at-home implementation.7-9 Moreover, just
50% of patients keep appointments or fill prescriptions, per-
petuating poor asthma control.10 Traditional care models do
not adequately address underlying risk factors, propagating
disparities and costly health care use. Within 12 months, ap-
proximately 40% of children and adolescents hospitalized for
asthma are rehospitalized or revisit the ED.2,11
Hamilton County, Ohio, the location of Cincinnati Chil-
dren’
sHospitalMedicalCenter(CCHMC),hasmorethan36 000
pediatric patients with asthma; more than 13 000 are Medic-
aid insured.3 With a global aim of improving the health of pe-
diatric patients in the area, the CCHMC launched the Asthma
Improvement Collaborative (AIC) in 2007; improvement ef-
forts started in earnest in 2009. In 2010, the AIC was embed-
ded within the CCHMC’
s 2015 strategic plan, aiming to re-
duce asthma-related hospitalizations and ED visits for
Medicaid-insured pediatric patients aged 2 to 17 years in Ham-
ilton County by 20% by June 30, 2015. Specifically, the AIC
sought to reduce the asthma-related hospitalization rate from
a rolling 12-month mean of 7.2 to 5.8 per 10 000 patients per
month and the ED visit rate from 20.9 to 16.7 per 10 000 pa-
tients per month.
Methods
Setting
From January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2015, a multidis-
ciplinary team used quality improvement methods and the
chronic care model to conduct interventions in inpatient, out-
patient, and community settings in the CCHMC. The CCHMC
is a 628-bed, urban pediatric academic center that cares for
more than 90% of Hamilton County children and adolescents
who require hospitalization and 65% or more of those seek-
ing emergency care. The CCHMC general pediatric clinics
provide primary care for approximately 34 000 Medicaid-
insured children and adolescents, including those cared for at
a primary care center opened during improvement efforts that
increased to serve approximately 6000 pediatric patients.12 In
addition, more than 7000 patients receive long-term asthma
careintheCCHMCpulmonaryorgeneralpediatricsclinicseach
year. There are approximately 1000 hospitalizations and ap-
proximately 2500 ED visits annually for asthma for in-
county children and adolescents. This project was reviewed
by the CCHMC Institutional Review Board and deemed to be
nonhuman subject research; therefore, informed consent was
not required. Because this study used population-based data,
no patient identifiers or patient-level data were used.
Planning the Study of the Intervention
The AIC was framed using the chronic care model13-17 and ex-
ecuted using quality improvement (QI) methods.18 The mul-
tidisciplinary improvement team consisted of hospitalist,
primary care, and community pediatricians; pediatric pul-
monologists and allergists; ED physicians; pediatric resi-
dents; social workers; respiratory therapists; nurses; care co-
ordinators;pharmacists;projectmanagers;QIconsultants;and
representativesfromMedicaidmanagedcareorganizationsand
the Cincinnati Health Department school health program.
A key driver diagram was developed to frame elements be-
lieved to affect use by the target population (Figure 1). Inter-
ventionswereimplementedinandcontinuedthrough3phases
(hospital-based inpatient care redesign, outpatient-based care
enhancements, and community-based supports and partner-
ships) and were tested using plan-do-study-act cycles.18
Improvement Activities
Because current hospitalization predicts future hospi-
talization,19,20 phase 1 targeted redesign of inpatient pro-
cesses for acute asthma management (Table and eTable in the
Supplement). Hospitalization was recognized as a sentinel
event, and focus was placed on identifying and mitigating rel-
evant medical, social, and environmental risks. Interven-
tions included the following:
• A medications-in-hand program that ensured that all pa-
tients received a 30-day supply of medications for use at
home, an asthma action plan, and standardized inhaler
training.
• An asthma-specific history and physical examination form
that prompted in-depth assessment of chronic asthma con-
trol, severity, and triggers.21
• Administration of an adapted Childhood Asthma Risk
Assessment Tool–Revised (CARAT-R).22
Key Points
Question Is implementation of a hospital-driven improvement
collaborative associated with a reduction in acute asthma health
care utilization in a population of Medicaid-insured pediatric
patients?
Findings In this study of Medicaid-insured pediatric patients with
asthma from Hamilton County, Ohio, monthly asthma-related
hospitalizations and emergency department visits decreased
significantly with use of a hospital-driven improvement
collaborative during a 5-year intervention period.
Meaning An integrated, multilevel approach using quality
improvement methods that extended from the hospital to the
community was associated with improved asthma outcomes for a
population of Medicaid-insured pediatric patients; similar models
could be applied to other chronic conditions to improve outcomes
and potentially reduce costs.

 • Decision support embedded in the electronic history and
physical examination and CARAT-R that suggested consul-
tation with pulmonary or allergy specialists if the diagnosis
was in question, if symptoms were hard to treat, or for ques-
tions about optimal management. Similar prompts sug-
gested referrals to social workers, environmental assess-
ments by Cincinnati Health Department sanitarians,23 or a
newly developed home health pathway.
• A home health pathway consisting of up to 5 in-home nurse
visits.Visitsweretailoredtofamilies’needsandincludededu-
cation on medications and trigger avoidance. Nurses also ad-
ministered the Asthma Control Test (ACT),24 ensured that an
asthma action plan and prescribed medications were in the
home, reinforced proper device use, conducted informal
environmental assessments, and supported needs related to
self-management. Findings were shared with primary care
practitioners.
• Partnerships with Medicaid managed care organizations to
support care transitions and leverage resources (medical
equipment, transportation).
Because primary care access and continuity improve
asthma outcomes,10,13 phase 2 focused on outpatient care pro-
cesses (Table and eTable in the Supplement). Routine asthma
visits were enhanced and standardized to focus on long-term
controlandacuteexacerbationfollow-up.Electronichealthrec-
ord (EHR)–based prompts facilitated determination of asthma
control, severity, and triggers. Refined processes promoted
families’scheduling and keeping ambulatory asthma appoint-
ments. Interventions included the following:
• Care coordination in the CCHMC primary care sites for chil-
dren with 1 or more asthma-related hospitalizations and/or
2 or more ED visits in the preceding 12 months. Care coordi-
nators, master’
s-level social workers certified as asthma edu-
cators, applied an intervention bundle, including risk assess-
ment, education, medication home delivery, collaboration
with a Medicaid managed care practitioner, and improved ac-
cess to community resources. Children graduated from care
coordination if they had no hospitalizations or ED visits for
365 consecutive days after enrollment.
• Standardized assessment of barriers to access, adherence,
and environmental exposures with direct linkages to care
modifications, including medication changes, referrals to
subspecialists, and/or community-based resources (eg,
medicolegal partnership).
• Enhanced previsit screening, including use of a standard-
izedmetered-doseinhalerchecklist,ACT,andEHR-basedpre-
visit planning tool.
• Expanding the home health pathway to accept referrals from
outpatient sources.
• Externalfunding25inDecember2010allowedtheCCHMCpri-
mary care practices to implement a web-based registry and
improved alert system through the local health information
exchange. Alerts notified practices of hospitalizations or ED
visits by a patient at any regional hospital system.26 This reg-
istry was replaced in November 2013 by an EHR-embedded
registry codeveloped by the CCHMC primary care and sub-
specialty practices to improve cross-divisional tracking.
Because asthma is influenced by community-based so-
cial determinants of health,2,8 phase 3 focused on enhancing
connections between the CCHMC and community resources
(Table and eTable in the Supplement). Interventions in-
cluded the following:
• Partnership with Cincinnati public schools and the Cincin-
nati Health Department School Nursing Program to deliver
bundled asthma-related services, including ACT collection,
protocols on how to access medication delivery services and
home health pathway, and facilitated referrals to asthma sub-
specialists.
• To build QI capacity within schools, 2 teams of school-
based health staff completed a CCHMC-sponsored QI course.

 Teams worked on increasing rates of ACT completion (and
sharing results with primary care physicians) and ensuring
that students had completed asthma action plans on file at
school.Successeswerespreadtoadditionalschools,andmore
teams were enrolled in QI courses, first spreading to schools
with high rates of asthma morbidity.2
• Read-only access to the CCHMC EHR system by school nurses
was tested to improve communication of ACT scores, asthma
action plans, primary care and subspecialty visits, and infor-
mation on hospitalizations and ED visits.
Methods of Evaluation
Primary outcomes were the rates of asthma-related hospital-
izations and ED visits by Medicaid-insured children and ado-
lescents aged 2 to 17 years living in Hamilton County. The base-
lineperiodforprimaryoutcomemeasureswasdefinedas2007
to2009,the3yearsbeforethelaunchofthe2015strategicplan.
This period was chosen because accurate and complete data
on enrollment from the state Medicaid office (denominators)
only became available in 2007. Although tests of change be-
gan during the preintervention or baseline period, these in-
terventions focused in the CCHMC on rehospitalizations and
ED revisits (Table). Broader work targeting children and ado-
lescents across Hamilton County commenced in 2010.
Hospitalization and ED data were obtained from hospital
administrative databases and reported per 10 000 total Med-
icaid enrollees. Asthma-related visits were identified using
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)
codes: asthma as the primary diagnosis (493.**) or a specified
set of respiratory diagnoses as primary diagnosis (034.**,
460.**-466.**, 472.**, 473.**, 475.**, 477.**- 493.**, 495.**,
496.**, 510.**-513.**, 786.**, and 995.**) with asthma as a
secondary diagnosis.
Secondary outcomes were the percentage of patients with
anasthma-relatedrehospitalizationorEDrevisitwithin30days
of a hospital discharge and the percentage of CCHMC primary
care patients with well-controlled asthma, defined as an ACT
score greater than 19. Process measures were assessed using
data collected at the point of care or extracted from the EHR
daily, weekly, or monthly.
Changes over time were tracked on annotated run charts
and statistical process control charts and displayed using Ex-
cel. When possible, standard industry criteria were used to dis-
tinguish random, common-cause variation from significant,
special-causechangesattributabletotheinterventions.27-29Pri-
mary statistical process control charts revealed a rolling 12-
monthmeanfortherateofasthma-relatedhospitalizationsand
ED visits. We opted for this type of chart to blunt potential ef-
fectsofseasonality.Thisapproach,however,incorporatednon-
independent historical data. Although each chart could de-
pict what would look to be special cause (8 consecutive points
above or below the established center line, 6 consecutive in-
creasing or decreasing points, or points outside control lim-
its), center lines could not be moved because of data
autocorrelation.29
To compensate for autocorrelation, we pursued a seg-
mented regression analysis, modeling interrupted time-
series data to draw conclusions about the effect across
phases.30Achangeintrendwasdefinedasachangeintheslope

 were grouped according to the timing of the 3 phases. Autore-
gressive models using the maximum likelihood method were
built using SAS statistical software (SAS Institute Inc).31 The
Durbin-Watson test for autocorrelation was performed on fi-
nal regression models.
Because data were autocorrelated, conventional meth-
ods for estimating absolute change, relative change, and CIs
would lead to biased results. Thus, predicted values were ob-
tained from respective autoregressive models instead.
Two additional models were built to estimate the num-
ber of hospitalizations and ED visits avoided because of the in-
terventions. To overcome the issue of overdispersion, a nega-
tive binomial regression model was built instead of a Poisson
regression model. The preintervention trend and slope after
eachinterventionphasewereindependentvariables(eMethods
in the Supplement).
Results
The study consisted of an estimated 36 000 children and ado-
lescents with asthma in Hamilton County (approximately
13 000 of whom are Medicaid insured and 6000 of whom are
cared for in primary care practices). Key process and out-
comemeasuresweretrackedthroughouteachphase(Tableand
eFigures 1-6 in the Supplement). The main inpatient (phase 1)
process measure was associated with the medications-in-
hand intervention. The percentage of patients discharged with
a 30-day supply of inhaled controller medications increased
from 50% in May 2008 to 90% by May 2010 (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement). The percentage of patients discharged with a
short course of oral corticosteroids increased from 0% to 70%
by March 2011 (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). The key second-
ary outcome, the 30-day rate at which hospitalized patients
were rehospitalized or revisited the ED, decreased by 41%
within 3 years of implementation of the inpatient care inter-
ventions, from 12% to 7% (Figure 2).
Outpatientprocesses(phase2)focusedonbaselineasthma
control of the CCHMC primary care patients. These processes
included ensuring that ACT scores were collected and pa-
tients were provided asthma action plans (eFigure 3 and eFig-
ure 4 in the Supplement). This phase also included our care
coordination program. By the end of June 2015, a total of 763
patients with high-risk asthma had been enrolled in asthma
carecoordinationand394hadgraduated;345wereofferedand
received medication delivery. After implementation of phase
2 interventions, the percentage of primary care patients with
well-controlled asthma increased from 48% to 54% (eFigure
5 in the Supplement).
In the community setting (phase 3), efforts focused on en-
hancing screenings and communication. By the end of the
study period, more than 80% of Cincinnati public school stu-
dents with asthma were screened using the ACT (eFigure 6 in
the Supplement). Those with suboptimal scores, indicative of
poorly controlled asthma, were referred to their existing or a
new medical home.
Ourphasedapproachcontributedtooutcomeimprovement.
Asthma-relatedhospitalizationsdecreasedfrom8.1(95%CI,7.7-
8.5) to 4.7 (95% CI, 4.3-5.1) per 10 000 in-county Medicaid pa-
tients per month by June 30, 2014, a 41.8% (95% CI, 41.7%-
42.0%) relative reduction (Figure 3). Asthma-related ED visits
decreasedfrom21.5(95%CI,20.6-22.3)to12.4(95%CI,11.5-13.2)
per10000in-countyMedicaidpatientspermonth,a42.4%(95%

creases in the rolling 12-month mean (rate per 10 000 Medic-
aidenrollees)were3.4(95%CI,3.3-3.5)forasthma-relatedhos-
pitalizations and 9.1 (95% CI, 9.0-9.2) for ED visits. From the
regression model, we estimate that during the last year of the
project (2015), the improvements were associated with a re-
duction of 153 hospitalizations and 318 ED visits (eMethods in
the Supplement). The improvement in health care utilization
was sustained for the subsequent 12 months, apart from a tran-
sient increase in hospitalizations and ED visits coinciding with
an enterovirus 68 outbreak in late summer to early fall of 2014.

 Interrupted time-series analyses confirmed these find-
ings, revealing the change in slope for key outcome measures
across all phases (Figure 4). For ED visit rates, a significant
change occurred in postintervention slopes across all phases
(Figure 4). Before the intervention, the slope was positive, im-
plying an increase in ED visits. After implementation of inter-
ventions, for each phase and cumulatively after all phases, the
slopesignificantlydecreased,indicatingadecreaseinthenum-
ber of ED visits. Findings were similar for hospitalization rates,
withasignificantchangeinslopeafterphase3(Figure4).There
was no autocorrelation in final regression models.
Discussion
Implementation of an integrated, multilevel approach fo-
cused on enhancing availability and accessibility of treat-
ments, removing barriers to adherence, mitigating risks re-
lated to adverse exposures, and augmenting self-management
and collaborative relationships between the family and the
health care system was associated with improved asthma out-
comes. During the initiative, Medicaid-insured children had
a more than 40% relative decrease in asthma-related hospi-
talizations and ED visits, whereas the number of 30-day re-
turn visits to the hospital or ED after an index hospitalization
decreasedby41%.Thus,patienthealthimprovedandtherewas
a potential reduction in cost, 2 critical arms of the Triple Aim
Initiative.32
We saw evidence of improvement across each phase. Al-
though QI methods make it difficult to isolate the most influ-
ential intervention, we expect that certain interventions were
particularly influential. Our first interventions targeted hos-
pitalized pediatric patients because, at baseline, 12-month
asthma rehospitalization rates at the CCHMC were approxi-
mately 20% and ED revisit rates were approximately 40%.2 In-
patient interventions shifted the focus to long-term manage-
ment by identifying barriers to asthma control. Previous
research has found that 38% to 70% of patients do not obtain
prescribed medications at hospital discharge33-35 despite evi-
dence that adherence to inhaled and oral corticosteroid treat-
ment after acute exacerbations reduces the risk of additional
acute asthma episodes.36,37 Having asthma controller and

 rescue medications and systemic corticosteroids in hand at
discharge likely obviated a major barrier (getting to a neigh-
borhood pharmacy) for the urban, indigent families in our
study. Thus, we believe that providing a 30-day supply of all
daily asthma medications at discharge was key to observed
improvements.
Successfulasthmamanagementrequiresmedicalandnon-
medical strategies that may be difficult for families to imple-
ment. Phases 2 and 3 applied and expanded inpatient-
focused interventions to outpatient and community settings.
Use of a care coordinator in primary care to facilitate deploy-
ment of an evidence-based care bundle led to reduced acute
care service use by some of the highest-risk patients in our
study.38 We believe that the bundle, which included in-depth
risk assessment, directed education, medication delivery, and
robust connections with hospital- and community-based part-
ners, including schools, promoted lasting relationships with
families and extended the reach of primary care.
To our knowledge, this is one of the largest population-
based improvement efforts to successfully reduce asthma-
related health care utilization by Medicaid-insured pediatric
patients. Other investigators have found similar improve-
ments in asthma symptoms and health care utilization with
multidimensional interventions. However, most have used a
randomized clinical trial design or have focused on small, se-
lect cohorts.39,40 We believe that using elements derived from
the chronic care model13-17 to structure the framework and in-
terventions was key to the success of our approach. More-
over, the QI frame with which interventions were developed
and tested allowed for real-world, sustainable improvements
to occur.
Our multidisciplinary, cross-divisional, community-
inclusive team was bolstered by trusting relationships and a
shared vision. We focused on supporting capacity building and
skill acquisition among frontline hospital- and community-
based health care professionals by using knowledge expan-
sion and QI training that was practical and translatable to the
workplace. Identifying neighborhoods with high rates of
asthma hospitalizations helped the teams and community to
understand and begin to tackle the problem.41 Sharing data
across systems promoted communication, shared decision
making, and improved health-condition management and
prompted interventions that support risk assessment, popu-
lation segmentation, and subsequent action. Focusing on tran-
sitions from hospital to primary care and to and from the com-
munity minimized lapses in continuity and provided more
opportunities to intervene before crises occurred.
Limitations
Our study has some limitations. First, although the observed
improvement could, in part, have been attributable to regres-
siontothemeanorreflectoverallimprovementinhealthacross
the studied community, this is unlikely given the long-term
baseline data and evidence of sustained improvement. The
most recent statewide data from the Ohio Hospital Associa-
tion indicates that hospitalization rates for patients aged 5 to
14 years increased slightly and then stabilized from 2007
through2009(26.2to29.3per10 000population).5,42,43More-
over, national data indicate that hospitalization and ED visit
rates for children were stable between 2001 and 2010; data be-
yond 2010 were not available nationally.4,5 More recent data,
although limited, suggest continued stability during the sub-
sequentyears.InOhio,pediatricpatientscoveredthroughMed-
icaid had a stable rate of hospitalizations and ED visits be-
tween 2011 and 2015.44 California had a relatively flat rate of
pediatric asthma hospitalizations between 2010 and 2014,45
whereas children in Missouri experienced an increase in acute
asthma hospital visits between 2005 and 2014.46 Second, al-
though the observed decrease in hospitalizations and ED vis-
its in our study may have resulted in cost savings, a formal eco-
nomicevaluationofthisprogramwasnotconductedandwould
be needed to understand the actual economic effect. Third, be-

 Fourth, this project took place in 1 county; our findings and in-
terventions may not be generalizable to other communities.
Conclusions
Children and adolescents with asthma experience consider-
able morbidity marked by persistent disparities. A multidis-
ciplinary approach to improving family-centered care deliv-
ery may reduce the rate of health care utilization for high-risk
patients. Our success has broad implications for manage-
ment of asthma and other chronic conditions. Under evolv-
ing care provision and payment models, use of a multidisci-
plinary team approach to long-term disease management is
feasible, with cost savings to potentially help sustain the
program.
