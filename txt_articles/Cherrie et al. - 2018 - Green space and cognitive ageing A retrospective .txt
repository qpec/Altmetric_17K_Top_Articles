International evidence suggests that green space has beneficial effects on general and mental health but little is
known about how lifetime exposure to green space influences cognitive ageing. Employing a novel longitudinal
life course approach, we examined the association between lifetime availability of public parks and cognitive
ageing. Lifetime residential information was gathered from the participants of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936
using a “life-grid” questionnaire at age 78 years. Parks information from 1949, 1969 and 2009 was used to
determine a percentage of parks within a 1500 m buffer zone surrounding residence for childhood, adulthood,
and later adulthood periods. Linear regressions were undertaken to test for association with age-standardised,
residualised change in cognitive function (Moray House Test score) from age 11 to 70 years, and from age 70 to
76 (n = 281). The most appropriate model was selected using the results of a partial F-test, and then stratified by
demographic, genetic and socioeconomic factors. The local provision of park space in childhood and adulthood
were both important in explaining the change in cognitive function in later life. The association between
childhood and adulthood park availability and change in the Moray House Test Score from age 70 to 76 was
strongest for women, those without an APOE e4 allele (a genetic risk factor), and those in the lowest socio-
economic groups.
Greater neighbourhood provision of public parks from childhood through to adulthood may help to slow
down the rate of cognitive decline in later life, recognising that such environmental associations are always
sensitive to individual characteristics.
1. Introduction
With the global increase in life expectancy, there is an urgent need
to identify factors that affect changes in cognitive abilities as people
age. Explanatory models of cognitive ageing posit a variety of demo-
graphic, genetic, behavioural and environmental factors contributing to
cognitive function (Anstey, 2014). The focus of the current research is
on how environmental conditions – or more specifically local green
spaces - throughout life affect people's cognitive ageing relative to one
another. There have been significant advances made in understanding
the range of demographic, genetic, and behavioural factors affecting
cognitive ageing. For instance, women tend to have greater resilience to
age-related decline (McCarrey et al., 2016). The major genetic predictor
responsible for increased susceptibility to non-normative cognitive
ageing is the presence of the APOE (apolipoprotein) e4 allele (Davies
et al., 2014; Deary et al., 2012b; Schiepers et al., 2012). Behavioural
factors, including diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol con-
sumption, closely related to an individual's socioeconomic status, are
often associated with cognitive function in older age, although, apart
from smoking, results differ between studies and some associations are
prone to confounding by prior cognitive function (Deary et al., 2009;
Plassman et al., 2010). Little work has considered specific built, social
or environmental features of local areas, with previous research relying
on aggregate measures of social deprivation (Lang et al., 2009). Yet
cognitive function could be affected by a range of environmental or
neighbourhood conditions including: local social capital; residential

 segregation; perceived safety and incivilities; availability of community
resources such as food shops and other services; walkability; and the
availability of public open space or local greenness (Y. T. Wu et al.,
2015a).
It is well established that public open space and greenness is often
beneficial for the physical and mental health of local residents (van den
Berg et al., 2015). It is also feasible that public open space and green-
ness may help to optimise cognitive function. Several studies with dif-
fering population, design and outcome measures are suggestive of a
direct positive benefit of natural environments to directed attention
(Ohly et al., 2016). Increased support and motivation for social inter-
action and physical activity, reductions in stress and exposure to higher
air quality offer indirect benefits to cognitive capability, evidenced by a
large body of research on changes in physiological markers and emo-
tional states (Hartig et al., 2014). Other indirect benefits such as ex-
posure to beneficial microbiota could indirectly affect cognitive pro-
cesses through facilitating a reduction in blood pressure and boost to
immune function (M. Kuo, 2015). Some of these mechanisms have been
shown to directly link with change in cognitive function; for example,
in participants over 70 years old, low levels of leisure-time physical
activity were associated with a decline in cognitive function five years
later (Willey et al., 2016). The only previous longitudinal study of area-
level greenness and cognitive change focused on children. The authors
found that greenness surrounding a child's home, school and commute
was correlated positively with improvements in memory and a reduc-
tion in inattentiveness (Dadvand et al., 2015a). However, the study
only considered these associations over a 12-month period during early
life, and therefore the influence of green space on cognitive function
over an individual's lifetime remains unknown.
In the present study, we examined whether availability of green
space (using a measure of nearby public parks) was associated with age-
related changes in cognitive function between age 11 and 70 years, and
between age 70 and 76 years. Three life course models (critical periods,
accumulation, and effect modification) were used to address three key
hypotheses. First, early childhood has been shown to be a critical period
for brain growth due to heightened brain plasticity (Lyu and Burr,
2016). Therefore, we hypothesised that greater public park availability
during childhood has positive associations with cognitive change in
later life (critical period model). Second, we hypothesised that a greater
accumulation of park availability over life is required to promote suc-
cessful cognitive ageing in later life (accumulation model). This was
based on the assumption that cross-sectional effects of access to parks
on cognitive function are consistent, albeit weaker, over time (Dadvand
et al., 2015a) and that for significant cognitive ageing to be observed a
threshold must be surpassed (Anstey, 2014). Finally, by combining the
critical periods and accumulation models, we hypothesised that avail-
ability during adulthood is important for determining the extent of
cognitive reserve, with the capacity to modify the effect of exposure on
the sensitive childhood period (effect modification model). As men-
tioned previously, demographic, genetic and behavioural factors will
set an individual on a unique cognitive health trajectory. Therefore,
with the aim to determine which groups would benefit most from
greater park availability, we stratified the life course model by sex, the
presence of an APOE e4 allele, and occupational social class (as a
marker of individual socioeconomic status).
2. Methods
2.1. Study design and setting
A retrospective life course study was designed using data from the
Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) (Deary et al., 2007, 2012a). The
participants, who were all born in 1936, were recruited from Edinburgh
and the Lothians in Scotland. Most had taken part in a nationwide as-
sessment of their general intelligence in 1947 (Scottish Mental Survey,
1947; N = 70,805) (SCRE, 1949). The cohort participants were re-
contacted in 2004 and, from 2318 responses, 1091 were eligible for
wave 1 data collection (Deary et al., 2012a). Cohort participants were
subsequently contacted and tested at mean ages of approximately 70
years (Jul 2004–May 2007), 73 (Oct 2007–May 2010) and 76 (Jul
2011–Nov 2013). At mean age 78, a stand-alone questionnaire booklet
was posted out with returns received between July 2014 and April
2015.
2.2. Operationalising change in cognitive function
We operationalised the outcome of cognitive ageing using the par-
ticipant's Moray House Test No. 12 (MHT) scores from mean ages of 11,
70 and 76 years (SCRE, 1949). The MHT is a validated measure of
cognitive function, which correlates highly with the current “gold
standard” cognitive tests (Deary et al., 2004). The MHT is a general
intelligence test that is composed of 71 items, measuring the partici-
pant's ability on a variety of mental tasks including verbal reasoning,
arithmetic, and following directions. Each score was adjusted for age in
days at the time of examination by taking the standardised residuals
from a linear regression with age as the independent variable. The score
was then standardised to have a mean of 100 and standard deviation of
15. Change was calculated by generating the standardised residual from
a linear regression model with previous MHT score (e.g. change from 11
to 70 calculated by taking age 70 score as the dependent and age 11 as
the independent variable). This statistical technique to calculate change
in score is superior to an arithmetic difference as the outcome is in-
dependent of baseline level (Prochaska et al., 2008), and has been used
in relation to changes in cognitive function previously (Gow et al.,
2005). The procedure above provided two outcomes: residualised
change in MHT score from age 11 to 70 and residualised change in MHT
score from age 70 to 76.
2.3. Operationalising LBC1936 covariates
During the structured interview as part of the cognitive testing ap-
pointment at age 70, respondents provided the information required for
all the covariates except for father's social class, which was obtained via
a questionnaire, and BMI, which was obtained during the physical ex-
amination. Covariates were selected a priori based on previous litera-
ture (Deary et al., 2009), including sex, Occupational Social Class (OSC)
(Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, 1980) of participant's fa-
ther, people per room in childhood household, childhood smoking
status, OSC of participant, smoking status and alcohol consumption
(Deary et al., 2007). OSC of the participant's father was used as a
measure of socioeconomic status from childhood and dichotomised into
Professional-managerial (I and II) and Skilled, partly skilled, unskilled
(III, IV and V). Additionally, we used childhood overcrowding as a
secondary measure of socioeconomic status, defined as the number of
people per household room. Participants were asked at what age they
started smoking and were categorised as a childhood smoker if they
responded that they had started before age 16, as per convention
(Hopkinson et al., 2014). Smoking status at age 70 was dichotomised as
smoker or non-smoker. Similarly, alcohol consumption was dichot-
omised as drinks alcohol or doesn't drink alcohol. BMI at age 70 was
calculated as weight divided by height squared. Socioeconomic status
during adulthood was defined by OSC of the participant's main job from
their career and dichotomised in the same way as their father's OSC. For
females, husband's OSC was used if higher than their own. We selected
a number of variables as effect modifiers a priori including sex, adult-
hood OSC and APOE e4 allele. Sex and adulthood OSC at age 70 were
operationalised as above. Blood samples were taken during examina-
tion and participants were genotyped for APOE allele status using
TaqMan technology at the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility
Genetics Core (Deary et al., 2012a). Participants were dichotomised
into having at least one APOE e4 allele or having none. In addition to
the variables above, we selected several variables to act as auxiliary

 variables in the imputation of missing data. Due to the association with
cognitive ageing, these included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale score (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983), history of stroke (Yes or No)
and family history of heart disease, stroke, or problems with blood
vessels (Yes or No).
2.4. Operationalising public parks information
We identified four open space surveys that recorded public parks in
Edinburgh during the 20th and 21st century (Pearce et al., 2016).
Public parks were deemed a suitable indicator of urban green space
because they promote social interaction and a range of uses, including
physical activity, to a greater extent than ambient greenery (such as
road side verges or river corridors) (E. Richardson et al., 2010). Public
parks data were scanned from paper maps from the Edinburgh Civic
Survey 1949 (Abercrombie et al., 1949) and the Open space survey
1969 (Town Planning Department Edinburgh, 1969), georeferenced
and converted to geographic information system vector data using
ArcMap 10.1 GIS software (ESRI, Redlands, CA). Contemporary public
parks data were derived from the Open Space Audit 2009 (The City of
Edinburgh Council, 2009). Although descriptions of the parks changed
slightly between surveys (e.g. “public parks” and “public recreation
grounds”), consistency was confirmed by the continued presence in
certain spaces over time. Hereafter we refer to these spaces simply as
‘parks’.
2.5. Operationalising lifetime residential address history
The surviving participants of the LBC1936 were re-contacted in
2014 (mean age 78) (n = 704/1091), and asked to fill out a residential
(i.e. Life grid) questionnaire (Blane, 1996), with a response rate of 87%
(n = 612/704). From these responses, a total of 593 participants had
useable life grid data; these participants are referred to as the “Life grid
sample”. The participants were given the option to recall the dates of
personal events in their life, and to fill them in next to a column con-
taining global events such as the Falklands War. These events acted as
memory prompts for participants to provide information on their re-
sidential address and occupation (of self or father) for each decade from
birth. We have utilised contemporary sources to geocode the 7423
participant addresses. We geocoded the participant addresses using
Nomatim to query Open Street Map (OSM) (OpenStreetMap con-
tributors, 2017), as the accuracy for addresses in Edinburgh is between
1 and 3 m and the coverage is excellent (Grosso et al., 2015). The
output contained the latitude, longitude and the comma separated
OSM-derived address string (e.g. 82, Home Street, Edinburgh, United
Kingdom). This address string was then compared with what was sup-
plied by the participant, which was recorded in the same format. 15%
of the participant addresses were not able to be geocoded or had lost
information (i.e. the difference in the number of comma separated
‘information bits’ was negative). As we hypothesised that this may be
due to misspellings or imperfect matches, the Google Maps geocoding
API was used as it employs a fuzzy string matching algorithm. We then
manually compared the Google maps geocoding API quality output (i.e.
‘rooftop’, ‘range_interpolated’, ‘geometric_center’ and ‘approximate’) to
the address supplied by the participant. 6% of the google-derived
geocodes did not contain the same level of information supplied by the
participant and were manually geocoded using historic building re-
positories such as Canmore.org.uk (i.e. using the 8-digit National Grid
Reference, 1m resolution). Participants were eligible for the “Analysis
sample” (n = 281) if they recorded Edinburgh addresses during the
decades when parks were surveyed (i.e. childhood: 1949; adulthood:
1969; later adulthood: 2009). This approach was markedly less re-
strictive than an analysis sample where participants had to have all of
their previous addresses within Edinburgh (n = 174) and only resulted
in a modest drop in the mean percentage of the participant's total
number of addresses that were within Edinburgh (i.e. from 100% to
94%).
2.6. Determining park availability using lifetime residential address history
Park availability for the LBC1936 participants was calculated by
taking the percentage of park area that intersected with a 1500 m buffer
zone surrounding the participant's address at each time period (child-
hood, adulthood, and later adulthood). A 1500 m buffer zone was se-
lected as it corresponds to approximately a 15-25 min walk to the edge
of the buffer zone, based upon data on mean walk speeds of between 1
and 1.5 m/s for ages 20-80 (Ferrucci et al., 2016). Also, a 1500 m
circular buffer was used as approximately 90% of the 500 people sur-
veyed in the 1969 Open space survey reported travelling up to 1.6 km
(as the crow flies) to reach public parks within the city (Town Planning
Department Edinburgh, 1969). A sensitivity analysis was undertaken by
repeating the analysis using buffer zones of 500 m and 1000 m. The
availability of parks metric was analysed as a continuous variable, for
each 10% increase in park area within the 1500 buffer zone.
2.7. Main analyses
All statistical analysis was performed in R version 3.3.1. To in-
vestigate the relationship between availability of parks measured at
three time periods (childhood, adulthood and later adulthood) and
cognitive ageing, we adapted an established method to detect the most
appropriate life course model (Mishra et al., 2009). The general premise
was to build a series of linear regression models that represent the life
course models under investigation (“accumulation”, “critical periods”,
and “effect modification”). The model fit was then compared, via the
partial F test, with a “saturated” model. The “saturated” model was
specified by including all the individual park terms, three two-way
multiplicative interactions and a three-way multiplicative interaction
(Fig. 1; see Model 1). The saturated model represents the full com-
plexity of combinations of park availability through life. We determined
whether parks have an effect on cognitive ageing or not by comparing
the fit statistics of the saturated model with a “no effects” model which
contained only the intercept (Fig. 1; see Model 5). This “no effects”
model crudely predicted an individual's cognitive change as the mean of
the cognitive change experienced by all the participants. Thus, if park
availability was important for cognitive ageing then the inclusion of all
park terms would explain more of the variance in cognitive change than
just using the mean. This was established by comparison of the two
models using a partial F-test. If the “no effects” model fitted the data
just as well as the saturated model, then a p-value above 0.05 was
obtained and we could assume that parks did not have an association
with cognitive ageing. If the p-value was lower than 0.05, it signified
that the “no effects” model was not superior and we could assume that
parks had an effect on cognitive ageing. We could also, subsequently,
repeat this procedure to compare life course analyses and determine the
most appropriate models.
The Accumulation models were categorised into strict and relaxed.
The strict model was defined as the park terms summed (i.e. sum of
parks from childhood, adulthood and later adulthood), which assumed
that parks had an equal association with cognitive ageing, irrespective
of the time they were measured (Fig. 1; see Model 2a). The relaxed
model contained each of the park terms as individual predictors; i.e.
parks from childhood, adulthood and later adulthood were mutually
adjusted for one another, which allowed any differences in the strength
of association by time of park measurement to be observed (Fig. 1; see
Model 2b).
The Critical Periods models were tested by running separate models
for each park term from a single point in time. This assumed that the
other park terms did not influence cognitive ageing or modify the as-
sociation of the parks under investigation (e.g. Fig. 1; see Model 3a).
The Effect Modification models were defined at two points in time,
early and later, and were specified by including a multiplicative

58
 interaction term between parks from the two successive time periods
(i.e. an interaction between childhood parks and adulthood parks)
(Fig. 1; see Model 4a). These models emphasised the temporal sequence
of exposure during early or later life as being important for the eventual
association with cognitive ageing. As before, we compared the partial F-
statistics of each life course model with the “saturated” model. A p-
value of over 0.05 signified that the life course model fitted the data as
well as the “saturated model”. The life course model with the highest p-
value was deemed the most appropriate as this meant that it not only fit
the data as well as the “saturated model”, but was more parsimonious.
All models were adjusted for sex in a complete-case analysis. A positive
regression coefficient represented higher residualised change in cogni-
tive function between the time points (i.e. relatively better cognitive
change) whereas a negative regression coefficient represented de-
creasing residualised change in cognitive function between the time
points (i.e. relatively worse cognitive change). The multiplicative in-
teraction regression coefficient was interpreted as the coefficient of one
park term being conditional on another.
2.8. Adjusted and stratified analyses
After identifying the most appropriate life course model we con-
tinued to the multiple regression analysis, adjusting for childhood and
adulthood covariates. Some data were missing for covariates and the
two outcomes. These were assumed missing at random and imputed by
chained equations using the ‘mice’ package (van Buuren and Groothuis-
Oudshoorn, 2011). We imputed 20 datasets using the following socio-
demographic and behaviour variables that were proposed to be related
to the missing structure: sex, OSC, smoking, alcohol consumption and
BMI; and variables proposed to be associated with cognitive ageing:
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score, history of stroke, and
family history of heart disease, stroke or problems with blood vessels.
The estimates from the imputed datasets were pooled using Rubin's
rules. We then ran a linear regression for three nested models with
adjustment for: (i) sex; (ii) father's OSC, number of people per rooms in
childhood household, childhood smoking status, (iii) adulthood OSC,
alcohol consumption and adulthood smoking status. Finally, using the
fully adjusted model we stratified by sex, the presence of the APOE e4
allele and adulthood OSC.

 3. Results
We found few discernible differences between the Full sample and
the Analysis sample for most of the selected characteristics, as shown by
chi-square and two sample t-tests (Table 1). The Analysis sample had
significantly higher levels of individuals recorded as Skilled, partly
skilled, unskilled OSC during the adulthood period. The frequency of
missing data was low at below 6% for all the variables. We found si-
milar rates of missing data in the outcomes, with 6.7% for MHT change
from 11 to 70, and 4.6% for change in MHT score from 70 and 76. On
average, MHT scores increased from 11 to 70 and decreased from 70 to
76. There were differences in age standardised MHT scores by the se-
lected characteristics (Table 2). Men had lower scores at age 11, but
were similar to women at age 70 and 76. Those in the skilled, partly
skilled, unskilled OSC and carriers of the APOE e4 allele also performed
worse at each age. We compared the availability of parks at the three
measurement periods using Pearson correlation coefficients and found
the highest correlation between adulthood and later adulthood parks
(0.63) compared to the lowest between childhood and later adulthood
parks (0.19) (See Supplementary material; see Fig. S1). Median per-
centage of parks surrounding participant residence increased with
measurement period: from childhood at 7.0%, to adulthood at 7.7%,
and later adulthood at 8.4%. This mirrored the increase in parks in
Edinburgh during these periods (See supplementary material; see Fig.
S2).
3.1. Associations between availability of parks and cognitive change
There was no significant association between the availability of
parks and cognitive change from age 11 to 70, as shown by the com-
parison between the “no effects” model and the saturated model
yielding a p-value of over 0.05 (p = 0.780) (Table 3). However, there
was an association between park availability and cognitive change from
age 70 to 76, with the same comparison yielding a p-value below 0.05
(p = 0.027) (Table 3). The life course model with the best fit was the
“early effect modification” model (i.e. the interaction between child-
hood and adulthood parks), given that this model recorded the highest
p-value (p = 0.071) and the lowest AIC (758.1). The coefficient for the
interaction term was positive and statistically significant (β = 0.31;
95% CI 0.02–0.59) (Fig. 2). Fig. 2A shows the marginal effects of
childhood park availability on cognitive change from age 70 to 76,
conditional on the percentage of parks in adulthood. This shows that
childhood park availability had an increasingly positive/advantageous
association with cognitive change from 70 to 76 years as the person's
adulthood park availability increases. This was found predominantly at
the highest levels (i.e. top tertile) of adulthood park availability
(Fig. 2B).
3.2. Moderating role of demographic, genetic and socio-economic factors
As the most parsimonious model, we undertook further analysis
using the early effect modification model with adjustment for childhood
(i.e. father's OSC, childhood smoking status, people per room in
childhood home) and adulthood covariates (i.e. adulthood OSC,
adulthood smoking status and adulthood alcohol consumption status).
In the adjusted models, the coefficient was attenuated, to the extent
that in the fully adjusted model (i.e. model 3) the association was no
longer significant (β = 0.26; 95% CI -0.06–0.57) (Table 4). In analyses
stratified by these variables we found that the “early effect modification
model” was moderated by sex, the presence of the APOE e4 allele and
adulthood OSC. We found the association to be strongest in women
(β = 0.64; 95% CI 0.24–1.05), those without an APOE e4 allele
(β = 0.29; 95% CI -0.05–0.63) and in a Skilled, partly skilled, unskilled
OSC during adulthood (β = 0.66; 95% CI 0.15–1.18) (Table 5).
3.3. Sensitivity analyses
We found similar results when we used a stricter definition for the
Analysis sample (See Supplementary material; see Table S1). We also
tested how sensitive the results were to the buffer zone size. In the
sensitivity analysis, we found that the results for the 1000 m buffer zone
were similar to those using the 1500 m buffer zone, but no association
between parks availability and cognitive change was found using the
500 m buffer zone (see Supplementary material; see Table S2). A case-
complete analysis was undertaken to test our assumptions of data being
missing at random and we found that the coefficients varied marginally.
As we found that the interaction was most significant at the highest

 levels of adulthood park availability, we present the adjusted and
stratified results using tertiles of adulthood park availability (Table S3
and Table S4). Finally, in the current analysis, we acknowledge that the
meaning and purpose of public parks may differ depending on level of
urbanity (see Supplementary material; see Fig. S3). As a proxy for de-
gree of urbanity we have extracted the population density from the
Edinburgh Civic survey 1947 (for 1941) and 1951/1961 censuses and
appended this information to the participant addresses. In the fully
adjusted model (model 3), the early effect modification model coeffi-
cient for participants residing in areas with greater population density
(27.4–76 people per hectare) was 0.43 (95% CI; 0.00–0.86) compared
with −0.03 (95% CI; −0.52-0.47) for those residing in a lower popu-
lation density area (3.06–27.4 people per hectare).
4. Discussion
This research is the first to consider the role of green space in in-
fluencing cognitive ageing, and identifies an important new line of
enquiry for understanding the factors promoting successful cognitive
ageing. We examined the association between combinations of park
availability over an individual's lifetime and cognitive ageing. Our key
finding was that greater availability of parks in both childhood and
adulthood were associated with successful cognitive ageing in later life.
Although the effect size is modest, the result makes a valuable con-
tribution to understanding how aspects of physical environment may be
protective against poorer cognitive ageing. These findings are amongst
the first to suggest that environmental conditions in childhood might
have significant implications for health outcomes much later in life. The
work is also novel because it is the first to examine the role of green
space over a participant's lifetime in influencing any health outcome;
examining a wider set of health outcomes and environmental char-
acteristics are important next steps for researchers in this field.
We observed greater park availability in childhood to have a posi-
tive association with the stability of cognitive functioning in older
adulthood, conditional on early adulthood environment. Previous work
on children pre-post home relocation have shown cognitive function to
be highest amongst children who moved to greener neighbourhoods
(Wells, 2000). Other studies have found the school environment to be
important for childhood cognitive development, with significant posi-
tive effects on academic performance with higher surrounding green-
ness of schools (Dadvand et al., 2015b; C. D. Wu et al., 2014). In ad-
dition, objective measures of a child's residential neighbourhood and
self-reported greenness of their activity spaces have been associated
with fewer symptoms of social, emotional and behavioural difficulties
(F. E. Kuo and Taylor, 2004; E. A. Richardson et al., 2017).
Parks may represent a feature of the urban environment that are
more stimulating cognitively than other kinds of green spaces,

 including those found in rural environments (Cassarino et al., 2016).
Whilst it has been shown that a lower percentage of surrounding green
space and private gardens is associated with a higher likelihood of
cognitive impairment and dementia (Y. T. Wu et al., 2015b), this is not
uniformly the case (Clarke et al., 2012). Conflicting results in these
previous studies may be due to the age of participants. As the majority
of the participants in the Clarke et al. study were under 70 years old,
null findings may be because there were smaller variations in cognitive
ageing trajectories.
While we hypothesised that adulthood park availability modifies the
influence of childhood park exposure due to childhood being a sensitive
period for brain development, the reverse may also be true. It is feasible
that modification of park availability during adulthood by childhood
exposure relates to the theory of the “childhood factor”, whereby the
frequency of visits and positive experiences with natural spaces in
childhood predicts use in adulthood (Thompson et al., 2008). Those
who participated in nature-based recreation when they were children
may be better able to mitigate any constraints they face to participation
in adulthood (Asah et al., 2012). Other researchers stress the im-
portance of unstructured play for infants and structured support from
the family, school and social clubs thereafter strengthening the link
with nature-based recreation in adulthood (Lovelock et al., 2016; Wang
et al., 2013). Both interpretations emphasise the importance of child-
hood exposure and the associated opportunity for brain development
and acculturation, which, if not realised, could result in much lower
accumulated benefits from green space throughout life.
We found that associations were strongest in those without the
APOE e4 allele, women and those with skilled, partly skilled and un-
skilled occupations; these results may be explained by differences in
outcome subtype and interaction with parks. The presence of the APOE
e4 allele has been shown as the single biggest predictor of older age
cognitive change using the LBC1936 (Ritchie et al., 2016). Ritchie et al.,
found that women in the LBC1936 were more likely to retain cognitive
functions, in particular under the specific domain of acquired knowl-
edge, as they aged (Ritchie et al., 2016). Previous studies have found
that biomarkers of inflammation consistently associate with cognitive
ageing (Marioni et al., 2010; Rafnsson et al., 2007), but in some cases,
associations have also only been found in women and those without the
APOE e4 allele (Metti et al., 2014). These results could be due to dif-
ferences in the pathology of cognitive ageing. The presence of APOE e4
alleles is mainly associated with Alzheimer's dementia (Corder et al.,
1993) and women experience cardiovascular health problems 7-10
years later than men (Maas and Appelman, 2010). Taken together, our
result may suggest that park availability, through the potential me-
chanism of inflammatory biomarker variability, could have a greater
impact on vascular dementia, thus explaining heightened significance
in these groups. Our finding of a stronger association for lower socio-
economic individuals is consistent with previous evidence showing that
the greenest areas have the lowest inequality in mortality (R. Mitchell
and Popham, 2008) and mental wellbeing (R. J. Mitchell et al., 2015).
This may be because those in a lower socioeconomic status have less
resource to take advantage of spaces outside of their immediate en-
vironment, and therefore spend more time closer to home.
A major strength of the study is the availability of childhood mea-
sures of cognitive function and repeated measures in older age from the
LBC1936 study, thus reducing the issue of reverse causality associated
with cognitive testing being undertaken within older age only. We have
used change in cognitive function rather than level at one point in time,
thus avoiding cohort-specific differences in ageing and measurement
error (Liu et al., 2010). Our outcome is complemented by our en-
vironmental exposure being the most consistently used measure of
historical natural space currently available (Pearce et al., 2016). We
have also considered parks throughout life, decreasing differential as-
sessment error which can occur from using an address from a single
point in time (e.g. birth or last known address) (Brokamp et al., 2016).
However, given the lengthy time frame of exposure we were unable to
classify subtypes of green space (e.g. golf courses, allotments) or the
quality of green space, which has been shown to be important in con-
temporary analyses (Wheeler et al., 2015). The life course method we
applied has been validated (Mishra et al., 2009). We used continuous
variables in the life course models, hence slight modifications to the
specifications presented elsewhere. Namely, we did not constrain the
effect modification models to have fixed effects to be 0, which would
have resulted in a decrease in the model degrees of freedom and
therefore errors in the nested model comparison. We conducted a
sensitivity analysis dichotomising the variables, based on being within
the highest quartile for public park availability with the fixed effects
constrained to 0, and the results were congruous to the continuous
analysis. Findings from the sensitivity analysis suggest that level of
urbanity, defined by residential population density in childhood, has an
impact on the effect size and significance of the associations. The non-
significant relationship in suburban areas may be in part due to the
differences in use of public parks, whereby suburban residents have
lower reliance on public parks, as private gardens and other types of
green space (e.g. river/canal corridors and forests) may be used more
often (Mitchell and Popham, 2007). We did not perform sensitivity
analyses with different buffer methods as we would expect the same
results regardless of whether a circular or network buffer was used
(Bodicoat et al., 2014).
A weakness of this study is the retrospective data collection of re-
sidential address history, which can be prone to recall bias. We were
also limited by the numbers available for the analysis sample due to the
criteria for eligibility being based on continued lifetime residence in a
small geographic area. It was necessary to dichotomise OSC as to pro-
vide greater statistical power for stratified models (i.e. to keep cell sizes
to an appropriate size). This dichotomisation was also appropriate
when this variable was used as a covariate, as previous research found
that significant differences in health outcomes were only found be-
tween “professional or managerial occupations” compared to the rest
(Gale et al., 2016). We dichotomised other covariates (e.g. smoking
status) as they were not recorded in the same way for childhood and
adulthood and therefore dichotomisation was used to aid interpretation
of change over time. The analysis sample was broadly similar in terms
of selected characteristics compared with the full cohort at age 70, but
selection bias may have caused a higher number of participants from
lower socioeconomic groups being included. The issue of selection bias
was partly addressed by running the sensitivity analysis using a sample
with different assumptions. For addresses within the Edinburgh area,
the precision of the addresses supplied varied and therefore, for a small
number of addresses that did not have a house number, the error be-
tween actual participant residence and geocoded address was larger as
we took the centre of their street. In addition, by geocoding using
contemporary sources, we have assumed that the street layout was the
same as it is today for the majority of the addresses, with only minor
changes to the street content. However we acknowledge that these
small changes could have affected the precision of the park exposure
estimate for the earlier time periods. Given that we were geocoding a
relatively small number of addresses, we were able to employ a system
to detect information lost compared with what was supplied, so that if
the results were unsatisfactory they would be geocoded manually. This
ensured that addresses that had changed significantly (e.g. demolished)
would be geocoded to the same accuracy as those that were able to be
geocoded with contemporary sources (< 3m). Given the complexity of
the existing analysis, with multiple exposures from different time
points, we were unable to include the examination of non-linearity.
However, we would encourage this in future analyses, especially using
the forthcoming cognitive data waves in the LBC1936.
Availability of parks represents a ‘cumulative opportunity’ indicator
of urban green space, which was shown recently to represent the sum of
intentional and incidental interactions to a greater extent than proxi-
mity based measures (Ekkel and de Vries, 2017). However, we were still
unable to distinguish how the space was being used and therefore the

 specific mechanisms by which green spaces were beneficial to health. It
has been argued that the sum of a range of mechanisms could have a
large effect on health through the pathway of enhanced immune
function (M. Kuo, 2015). Even though the effect of individual me-
chanisms may only contribute slightly to this effect, the ability to define
the function of specific green spaces, and use these individual function-
based accessibility metrics to examine the association with mechanisms
via responses or biomarkers from cohort participants is still warranted
to determine their relative importance. The challenge for future re-
search will be to collect accurate information on historical function and
use of public parks and green space by individuals over time.
This is the first study to consider the association between area-level
green space on long-term cognitive ageing but, unlike recent studies
over shorter time frames (Dadvand et al., 2015a), we did not estimate
the effect of school, work or commuting green space. Due to the long-
itudinal nature and complexity of the analysis, we concentrated on one
feature of the residential environment (green space) that may affect
cognitive ageing; however, in cross-sectional analyses, multiple features
have been examined (Clarke et al., 2012). In addition, we have tested
multiple temporal combinations of one feature of the urban environ-
ment, as advised previously (Mishra et al., 2009), but this may have led
to significant results by chance using conventional p-value thresholds of
0.05; therefore, we recommend the replication of these results in fur-
ther studies. Future studies in other settings can learn from the ap-
proach used in this study in collecting and harmonising historical green
space data (Pearce et al., 2016). Comparable green space surveys are
available in other large urban areas of the UK and could be linked to
cohorts with longitudinal health outcomes in later life. Further auto-
mation, using techniques such as Optical Character Recognition on
paper maps (e.g. those produced periodically in the UK by the Ordnance
Survey), offers significant analytical promise for extracting historical
environmental information for larger areas up to the national level.
Temporal environmental data collected at this spatial scale can then be
integrated with nationwide cohorts (e.g. the various British birth cohort
studies). This approach is contingent on the availability of participants’
residential addresses over time, which are increasingly being made
available for studies of health and place over the life course.
5. Conclusions
This study has demonstrated that environmental circumstances in
early life, in particular the availability of local parks, may have life-long
impacts on cognitive ageing, particularly for women, people without an
APOE e4 allele, and those in lower socioeconomic groups during
adulthood. The findings are not only novel but also have relevance for
policymakers. The results emphasise the need to ensure a good level of
access to parks throughout the life course, but particularly during
childhood. Encouraging parents to help their children's use of parks
become regular and frequent may also be warranted, as this can inspire
lifelong green space usage as well as providing continued positive ef-
fects for the parent (Refshauge et al., 2012). Future research could
usefully investigate the geographic nature of availability of parks (e.g.
accounting for movement from home to work and school) and which
features (e.g. safety, number of amenities) are important for both
children and adults to encourage lifelong use for health-promoting
behaviours, as well as considering how exposure to a wider set of en-
vironmental features across the life course affect health and wellbeing
in later life.
