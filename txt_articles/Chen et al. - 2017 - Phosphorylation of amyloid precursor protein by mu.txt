Mutations in LRRK2, which encodes leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, are the most common genetic cause of familial and
sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD), a degenerative disease of the central nervous system that causes impaired motor
function and, in advanced stages, dementia. Dementia is a common symptom of another neurodegenerative dis-
ease, Alzheimer’s disease, and research suggests that there may be pathophysiological and genetic links between
the two diseases. Aggregates of b amyloid [a protein produced through cleavage of amyloid precursor protein
(APP)] are seen in both diseases and in PD patients carrying G2019S-mutant LRRK2. Using patient-derived cells, brain
tissue, and PD model mice, we found that LRRK2 interacted with and phosphorylated APP at Thr668 within its intra-
cellular domain (AICD). Phosphorylation of APP at Thr668 promoted AICD transcriptional activity and correlated with
increased nuclear abundance of AICD and decreased abundance of a dopaminergic neuron marker in cultures and
brain tissue. The AICD regulates the transcription of genes involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and apoptosis. Over-
expression of AICD, but not a phosphodeficient mutant (AICDT668A), increased the loss of dopaminergic neurons in
older mice expressing LRRK2G2019S. Moreover, the amount of Thr668-phosphorylated APP was substantially greater
in postmortem brain tissue and dopaminergic neurons (generated by reprogramming skin cells) from LRRK2G2019S
patients than in those from healthy individuals. LRRK2 inhibitors reduced the phosphorylation of APP at Thr668 in the
patient-derived dopaminergic neurons and in the midbrains of LRRK2G2019S mice. Thus, APP is a substrate of LRRK2,
and its phosphorylation promotes AICD function and neurotoxicity in PD.
INTRODUCTION
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease
that is characterized by the loss of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA)
neurons, which leads to a reduction of dopamine in the striatum
(1). Among the known genetic contributors to PD, pathogenic leucine-
rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutations are currently recognized to be
the most common, accounting for up to 40% of familial cases in cer-
tain populations (2). Increasing evidence suggests that some LRRK2
mutations exert their toxicity through an enhanced LRRK2 kinase ac-
tivity (3). In particular, the common G2019S mutation has been
shown to elevate LRRK2 kinase activity toward generic kinase sub-
strates and to induce neuronal loss by enhancing the phosphorylation
of putative downstream targets (4). To improve our understanding on
how enhanced LRRK2 kinase activity contributes to PD development,
it is important to identify specific LRRK2 substrates that mediate its
neurotoxicity.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia
among the elderly. Although AD and PD have distinct genetic risk
factors that contribute to susceptibility to each disorder, previous re-
search revealed that there might be common pathophysiological and
genetic links between these two diseases (5–8). LRRK2 has been found
to phosphorylate Tau by promoting the activity of glycogen synthase
kinase–3b (GSK-3b), which induces the mislocalization of Tau (9, 10).
Altered Tau phosphorylation is closely related to AD pathogenesis (11).
Similarly, hyperphosphorylated amyloid precursor protein (APP) has
been observed in the brains of patients with AD (12), and the phospho-
rylation of APP at its tyrosine or serine or threonine residues can pro-
mote APP processing and result in neuronal loss (13). For example,
phosphorylation of APP at Thr668 generates amyloid depositions
(12). Moreover, amyloid depositions are seen to accumulate in post-
mortem specimens derived from carriers of LRRK2 mutations (14),
suggesting a link between the two pathogenic proteins. However, little
is known about the potential pathophysiological interplay between
LRRK2 and APP, particularly whether phosphorylation of APP might
predispose neurons to LRRK2-mediated toxicity in PD. Here, we used
LRRK2G2019S mouse models and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)–
derived neurons from PD patients to investigate the potential patho-
physiological interplay between LRRK2 and APP in PD.
RESULTS
LRRK2 interacts with APP
Previous studies show that LRRK2 phosphorylates Tau and induces its
mislocalization (9, 10), suggesting a link between the neuro-
degenerative processes in PD and AD. Given this, we speculated that

 LRRK2 might also interact with APP, a pathogenic protein of AD. To
determine whether LRRK2 interacts with APP, we cotransfected Flag-
tagged APP with LRRK2 complementary DNAs (cDNAs) into human
embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells. Upon confirmation of over-
expressed APP and LRRK2 in HEK293T cells, we performed immu-
noprecipitation and subsequent Western blot analysis. The assays
revealed that LRRK2 and Flag-APP reciprocally coimmunoprecipi-
tatedwithAPPandLRRK2(Fig.1,AandB).WhenAPPwascoexpressed
with PD-associated mutant LRRK2 (G2019S) or kinase-deficient
LRRK2 (D1994A), we found that Flag-APP bound to LRRK2G2019S
or LRRK2D1994A with similar efficiency relative to its interaction with
wild-type LRRK2 (Fig. 1C) and vice versa (Fig. 1D). To examine the
interaction on an endogenous level, we immunoprecipitated LRRK2
or APP from adult mouse brain lysates, and LRRK2 was present in the
APP immunoprecipitates and vice versa (Fig. 1E). Our data therefore
suggest that LRRK2 may interact with APP.
LRRK2 phosphorylates APP at Thr668
We then explored whether LRRK2 phosphorylates APP. Full-length
LRRK2 protein and recombinant human APP were mixed with aden-
osine triphosphate (ATP) in kinase assay buffer and then loaded
onto a 4 to 12% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
gel. After electrophoresis, in-gel digestion was performed, and liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis
was carried out on an Orbitrap Fusion (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
We found that the only identified phosphorylation site of APP was
K.QYTSIHHGVVEVDAAVTPEER.H (Thr724, equivalent to Thr668
of APP695 protein sequence) (Fig. 2A). The phosphorylation degree
[area of phosphorylated peptide/(area of unphosphorylated peptide +
area of phosphorylated peptide)] was estimated as 2.6% (Fig. 2B), sug-
gesting that LRRK2 directly phosphorylated APP at Thr668. This predic-
tion was confirmed with in vitro kinase assays (fig. S1A) as well as
Western blot analyses showing that expression of either wild-type or
PD-associated mutant (G2019S), but neither ROC (“Ras of complex
proteins”) domain–mutant [R1441G; (15)] nor kinase-deficient
(D1994A) LRRK2,increasedThr668-phosphorylatedAPPin transfected
HEK293T cells (Fig. 2, C and D, and fig. S1, B and C). To determine
whether LRRK2 phosphorylates APP at Thr668 in neuronal cells, West-
ern blot analysis of cortical neurons isolated from the brain tissue of
nontransgenic (NTg) or transgenic (Tg) LRRK2G2019S mice showed an
increased abundance of phosphorylated APP in Tg neurons compared to
NTgcontrolneurons(Fig.2,EandF).ShorthairpinRNA–1(shRNA-1)–
mediated knockdown of endogenousLRRK2 abundance in NTg primary
cortical neurons (fig. S1, D and E) reduced APP phosphorylation at
Thr668 (Fig. 2, G and H).
LRRK2 stimulates the transcriptional activity of the APP
intracellular domain
Phosphorylation of APP at Thr668 affects APP processing and is
known to stimulate APP intracellular domain (AICD) production
through nonamyloidogenic metabolism of the protein (16). Given
our demonstrated relationship between LRRK2 and APP phosphoryl-
ation, we evaluated the effect of LRRK2 on AICD transcriptional ac-
tivity using the APP-Gal4 and C99-Gal4 luciferase reporter systems
(Fig. 3A), in which AICD fused to Gal4 interacts with the Gal4 re-
sponse element and activates the expression of a luciferase reporter
(17, 18). We found that coexpression of APP-Gal4 with LRRK2 or
LRRK2G2019S in HEK293T cells led to enhanced reporter activity by
upto two-tofourfoldcomparedtovectorcontrol.Moreover, LRRK2G2019S
induced more AICD transcriptional activity than did wild-type LRRK2.
In contrast, kinase-deficient LRRK2D1994A abolished AICD transcrip-
tional activity when compared to LRRK2 or LRRK2G2019S (Fig. 3B). Sim-
ilar to APP-Gal4, coexpression of C99-Gal4 led to a two- to threefold
increase of AICD transcriptional activity in the presence of LRRK2 or,
to a greater extent, LRRK2G2019S (Fig. 3C). To further confirm the role
of Thr668 phosphorylation in APP processing, we mutated the APP-Gal4
and C99-Gal4 luciferase constructs at this residue to alanine (T668A).
The luciferase assay showed that AICD reporter activity was inhibited
significantly in cells expressing APPT668A (Fig. 3, B and C). In addition,
Western blotting showed that AICD protein abundance was greater in
LRRK2G2019S-transfected cells than in wild-type or kinase-deficient
mutant LRRK2–transfected cells (fig. S2, A and B). Together, the data
indicate that Thr668 phosphorylation promotes Gal4/reporter interac-
tion, thus suggesting that Thr668 phosphorylation may promote AICD
function.
AICD translocates to the nucleus and is associated with
dopaminergic neuron loss in 20-month-old Tg
LRRK2G2019S mice
Given the role of LRRK2G2019S in dopaminergic (DA) neurodegenera-
tion (1, 3) and our findings that it phosphorylated APP at Thr668, we
hypothesized that the two observations were linked and that LRRK2G2019S

 may induce DA neuronal loss through the phosphorylation of APP. To
investigate this in vivo, we isolated the midbrain from 12- and 20-month-
old NTg and LRRK2G2019S Tg mice, respectively. By Western blotting and
immunohistochemical staining analysis, we found no significant
difference in the abundance of Thr668-phosphorylated APP (fig. S3, A
and B) or the amount of the DA neuron marker tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH) in 12-month-old LRRK2G2019S Tg mice compared to NTg controls
(fig. S3, A and C to E). This is consistent with the lack of DA neurotoxicity
that is observed in 12-month-old LRRK2G2019S mice (19). In contrast, in
midbrains from 20-month-old LRRK2G2019S mice, we saw increased
abundance of Thr668-phosphorylated APP relative to controls (Fig. 4,
A and B), which correlated with a decreased amount of TH (Fig. 4, A
and C to E). To evaluate whether the neuron toxicity is selective to DA
neuron in the substantia nigra (SN), we performed TH and neuronal

 nuclei immunofluorescence staining; the result showed that DA neuro-
nal loss in 20-month-old LRRK2G2019S Tg mice was mainly selective to
thelossofDAneuronsin the SN, but notothertypesof neurons(fig. S7).
These results suggest that phosphorylation of APP at Thr668 correlates
with age-associated LRRK2G2019S-induced DA neuronal loss in vivo.
Immunostaining of 20-month-old mouse midbrain tissues showed
that phosphorylated AICD (hereafter referred to as “phospho-APP”
per antibody used) was localized mainly to the nuclear compartment
in LRRK2G2019S mice (Fig. 4F). We quantified the intranuclear
phospho-APP immunostaining signal intensity and found that the
abundance of phospho-APP per TH-positive cell in LRRK2G2019S
Tg mice was significantly higher than that in NTg mice, but with less
TH (cytoplasmic) in LRRK2G2019S than NTg control mice (Fig. 4, F
and G). These results suggested that increased phospho-APP in the
nuclear fraction was associated with a reduction in TH abundance.
To investigate whether the phosphorylation of APP by LRRK2 pro-
motes AICD nuclear translocation, we isolated the nuclear fraction
from 20-month-old LRRK2G2019S midbrains and performed Western
blot analysis to detect AICD using an antibody against the C terminus
of APP. We found that the amount of AICD was increased in the
nuclear fraction of LRRK2G2019S mouse midbrain tissues (fig. S3, F
and G). We used the nuclear protein histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1)
to assess enrichment of the nuclear fraction (20). Collectively, these
results indicated that the phosphorylation of APP leads to AICD
translocation to the nucleus and triggers TH-positive cell loss in
LRRK2G2019S mice.
AICD exacerbates LRRK2G2019S-mediated neurotoxicity
in culture
Several studies demonstrate that nuclear translocation of the AICD
induces neurotoxicity (16, 21). Given that phosphorylation of APP
at Thr668 enhanced the nuclear translocation of the AICD and was
correlated with LRRK2G2019S-induced neuronal loss (Fig. 4), we ex-
plored the direct regulation of AICD in LRRK2G2019S-mediated neu-
rotoxicity in cultured cells using the lentiviral UbC promoter to drive
AICD transgene expression and the P2A promoter to drive tdTomato
(Fig. 5A). Western blot analysis demonstrated the expression of wild-
type and phosphodeficient AICD constructs in HEK293T cells (Fig.
5B). Lentivirally expressed wild-type or phosphodeficient AICD
(AICDT668A) was introduced into cortical neurons derived from
LRRK2G2019S Tg and control (NTg) mice. We found that expression
of AICD alone was sufficient to induce neuronal toxicity and exacer-
bated toxicity when introduced into LRRK2G2019S neurons (Fig. 5, C
and D), whereas expression of phosphodeficient AICDT668A exhibited
no neurotoxic effect in NTg control or LRRK2G2019S neurons (Fig. 5, C
and D). Neural injury was assessed as a measure of dendritic length
after AICD transduction into NTg control and LRRK2G2019S neurons.
Healthy neurons were defined as having at least one smooth neurite
extension that was twice the length of the cell body (22, 23). With this
criterion, we found that AICD led to neuronal damage and further
enhanced LRRK2G2019S-mediated neural injury (Fig. 5, E and F).
Our study suggests that APP, as a substrate of LRRK2G2019S, promotes
neuronal cell death and neurite shortening.
AICD exacerbates LRRK2G2019S-mediated neurotoxicity
in vivo
To confirm the effect of AICD on the regulation of LRRK2G2019S-
mediated neurotoxicity in vivo, we performed intrastriatal adminis-
tration of lentiviral-expressing wild-type and phosphodeficient
AICD into 12-month-old LRRK2G2019S mice. These mice were used
because we did not observe any TH loss at this age (fig. S3, A to E).
Three weeks after stereotaxic injection of AICD or AICDT668A virus
into the ipsilateral striatum of LRRK2G2019S mice, we found that len-
tivirally expressed AICD and AICDT668A were retrogradely trans-
ported to the TH-positive SN pars compacta region and infected
TH-positive cells (fig. S4, A and B). Control virus was injected into
the left hemisphere, whereas AICD or AICDT668A was injected into
the right hemisphere of the same mouse. Immunostaining for TH
revealed that wild-type but not phosphodeficient mutant AICD ex-
pression caused neuronal loss (TH cell viability), whereas phospho-
deficient AICD had no significant effect in NTg mice (Fig. 6, A to C)
or LRRK2G2019S Tg mice (Fig. 6, D to F); however, wild-type AICD
expression enhanced the neurotoxicity of LRRK2G2019S, reducing the
proportion of TH-positive cells in Tg mice further by ~20% (Fig.
6G). Thus, the cell culture and in vivo data suggest that the AICD
promotes LRRK2G2019S-mediated DA neuronal loss. Together, these
results indicated that AICD enhances LRRK2 neurotoxicity. Con-
versely, AICDT668A has no effect on neuronal cell loss.

 LRRK2G2019S phosphorylates APP at Thr668 in human DA
neurons and postmortem tissues
To address the pathophysiological relevance of APP phosphorylation
by LRRK2G2019S, we examined human DA neuronsgeneratedfrom hu-
man control and LRRK2G2019S-derived iPSCs. iPSC-derived neurons
were characterized by immunostaining (fig. S5). LRRK2G2019S neurons
displayed a significantly increased abundance of endogenous phospho-
Thr668 APP (Fig. 7, A and B). We detected a significant decrease in the
amount of TH in LRRK2G2019S neurons (Fig. 7, A and C), suggesting
neurodegeneration. Next, we examined whether phospho-Thr668 APP
was increased in LRRK2G2019S. Western blot analysis of patient tissue
and age- and gender-matched healthy donor postmortem brain tissue
revealed increased APP phosphorylation in the cytosolic fraction of the
cortex from LRRK2G2019S patients (Fig. 7, D and E). The total abun-
dance of LRRK2 was not significantly different (Fig. 7D).
An LRRK2 inhibitor reduces APP phosphorylation and
restores TH abundance in LRRK2G2019S patient–derived DA
neurons and in 20-month-old LRRK2G2019S mice
To confirm that the increased phosphorylation of APP was caused
specifically by LRRK2, we applied the LRRK2 catalytic inhibitor
LRRK2-IN-1 (24, 25) to cultured human iPSC-derived LRRK2G2019S
DA neurons. Given that LRRK2 kinase activity is dependent on phos-
phorylation of Ser935 and Ser910, we evaluate the phosphorylation sta-
tus of these sites to assess the efficiency of the LRRK2 inhibitor. Dose
response curves showed that LRRK2-IN-1 blocked the phosphoryl-
ation of both LRRK2G2019S at Ser935 and Ser910 (fig. S6, A to C) and
APP at Thr668 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7, F and G). De-
creased phosphorylation of APP correlated with increased abundance
of TH (Fig. 7, F and H), suggesting a greater number of neurons in
cultures treated with LRRK2-IN-1. To determine the pathological sig-
nificance of direct phosphorylation of APP by LRRK2 in vivo, we used
HG-10-102-01, a potent and selective LRRK2 inhibitor that is capable
of crossing the blood-brain barrier (26). Twenty-four hours after
treating mice with HG-10-102-01 [50 mg/kg by intraperitoneal
injection (26)], Western blotting of harvested midbrain tissues re-
vealed substantially less Ser935 phosphorylation of LRRK2 in 20-month-
old LRRK2G2019S mice than in controls (Fig. 7I), as well as significantly
less APP phosphorylation at Thr668 (Fig. 7, I and J) and less neuro-
toxicity as inferred from increased TH abundance (Fig. 7, I and K).
Together, our results suggest that LRRK2G2019S phosphorylates APP
in DA neurons, which promoted its intracellular domain translocation
to the nucleus and further induce neurotoxicity (Fig. 7L).
DISCUSSION
It is interesting that LRRK2 mutations have been associated with AD-
like pathology (14, 27), which supports the existence of overlapping
pathways between the two diseases. APP is an important molecule
in AD, and the phosphorylation of APP at tyrosine, serine, or threo-
nine residues can promote APP processing and result in neuronal loss
(16). Here, we show that LRRK2 phosphorylated APP at Thr668 and
that it further promoted the transcriptional activity of AICD, an intra-
cellular domain of APP, and its translocation to the nucleus to en-
hance LRRK2G2019S-induced neurotoxicity (Fig. 7L). In addition, we
found that the phosphorylation of Thr668 was increased in
LRRK2G2019S PD brains and in LRRK2G2019S iPSC-derived DA neu-
rons. Conversely, treatment with LRRK2 kinase inhibitor reduced
APP phosphorylation at Thr668. These observations suggest that the
enhancement of Thr668-phosphorylated APP was a pathology that is
specific to LRRK-related PD and that the transcriptional activity of
AICD contributes to LRRK2-mediated neuronal cell loss.
By LC/MS/MS analysis of APP, we found that Thr668 was the
unique site to be phosphorylated by LRRK2. Although various

 approaches have been performed to identify LRRK2 substrates, like
SILAC (28) and phosphoproteomics (29), none of the approaches
had identified APP as a potential substrate of LRRK2. Because
these experiments have been set using different values and individ-
ual criteria, both false-negative and false-positive results can occur.
Direct interaction experiments are still the most useful in validating
specific interactions.
There is no doubt that screening of the most important LRRK2
substrates is one of the key steps in developing efficacious drugs. Steger
et al. (29) identified only a subset of Rab guanosine triphosphatases as
bona fide physiological LRRK2 substrates with a high-stringency as-
say, but they still did not rule out the existence of other functional sub-
strates. Lin et al. (30) had explored the neuropathology of APP and
G2019S double-Tg mice in their work about LRRK2 and a-synuclein
and had not observed obvious APP-mediated astrocytosis and micro-
gliosis. However, the mice they detected were only 1 month old, and
the pathological change may not take place at this early stage. There-
fore, the relationship between LRRK2 and APP was still elusive; our
work has now uncovered APP as an LRRK2 substrate.
Phosphorylation of APP, seen in postmortem brain tissue from
AD patients, promotes APP processing by b- and g-secretase to gen-
erate Ab and promote neuronal loss (12). In contrast, the AICD,
which is also a product of this cleavage event, has received much less
attention. However, previous studies have shown that AICD regulates a
number of important cellular events (31–33). Here, we describe a PD-
related function of AICD, which promoted neuronal cell loss, reduced
dendrite length, and promotes LRRK2G2019S-induced neurotoxicity
in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we have discovered a new physiological role
for AICD in PD pathogenesis.
Previous studies have suggested that the release of Ab is not suffi-
cient to explain all of the neuropathological consequences of APP cleav-
age and that AICD may contribute to cellular dysfunction and death in

 APP-associated neurodegenerative diseases (31). Mice overexpressing
AICD do not show Ab accumulation, but they do display AD-like
pathologies, including Tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation,
GSK-3b activation, and working memory deficits (33). Moreover,
AICD is found to be increased in human AD brains (32). It has there-
fore been proposed that AICD may be causally involved in AD patho-
genesis. Understanding AICD signaling is more important than ever
because AICD is the pharmacological target of a compound under clin-
ical investigation for AD treatment and prevention. The compound 1-
(3′,4′-dichloro-2-fluoro[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)-cyclopropanecarboxylic
acid (CHF5074), which is in clinical trials aimed at treating mild cog-
nitive impairment and AD (34, 35), has been shown to interact with
the AICD and impair its nuclear translocation and activity (36). In the
future, it will be interesting to investigate whether the inhibition of
AICD will protect against LRRK2G2019S-induced neuronal loss in PD.
In conclusion, we have identified APP as a new substrate of
LRRK2 that contributes to LRRK2-mediated cell loss in PD. Our
study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying
LRRK2-induced neurotoxicity. It links LRRK2 and APP, two impor-
tant proteins that are involved in two of the most common neuro-
degenerative diseases (PD and AD). Furthermore, the identification
of targets of AICD can provide new therapeutic approaches to manag-
ing LRRK2-linked PD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
LRRK2G2019S Tg mice were generated using a bacterial artificial
chromosome containing the entire mouse LRRK2G2019S mutation
(19) and were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (#012467).
Genotypes were verified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using
genomic DNA from tails. LRRK2G2019S Tg and NTg male mice (12
and 20 months old) were maintained in accordance with institutional
guidelines, and all protocols were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the National Neuro-
science Institute (NNI) of Tan Tock Seng Hospital. The mice were main-
tained in a pathogen-free facility and exposed to a 12-hour light/dark
cycle with food and water.
Postmortem brain tissues
We obtained LRRK2G2019S and control postmortem samples from
UK Brain Bank. Postmortem study was approved by the SingHealth
Institutional Review Board Committee.
Constructs and inhibitors
Human wild-type LRRK2 cDNA was synthesized by PCR using
PfuUltra fusion HS DNA polymerase (#600670, Stratagene) and

which contributes to LRRK2G2019S-mediated neurotoxicity.

point mutation (G2019S) was introduced into the above LRRK2 by
using an XL QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (#200521, Stra-
tagene). The APP751 (NM_201413.1) clone was purchased from OriGene.
The C-terminal fragment of APP (AICD59) was amplified by PCR from
human APP cDNA with the following primers: 5′-CTAGCTAGCGC-
CACCATGATAGCGACAGTGATCGTCATCACC-3′ (forward) and
5′-CCGCTCGAGGTTCTGCATCTGCTCAAAGAACTTG-3′ (re-

lentiviral vector. A point mutation (T668A) was introduced by site-
directed mutagenesis according to the method described above
(#200521, Stratagene). All constructs were verified by sequencing to en-
sure the integrity of the cloned open reading frames.Togenerate theAPP-
Gal4 and C99-Gal4 mutant constructs, the LRRK2 substrate site (Thr668,
ACC) was mutated to Ala (GCC) based on the wild-type constructs using
the mutagenesis kit described above with the following primers: 5′-
GACGCCGCTGTCGCCCCAGAGGAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTC-
CTCTGGGGCGACAGCGGCGTC-3′ (reverse). The mutant constructs
were verified by sequencing. The LRRK2 kinase inhibitor HG-10-102-01
waspurchasedfromApexBio (#B1262), andLRRK2-IN-1 was purchased
from Tocris Bioscience (#4273).
Cell culture
The American Type Culture Collection cell line of HEK293T was
maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
(#D1152, Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine ser-
um (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% glutamine, 1% non-
essential amino acid (NEAA), and 1% sodium pyruvate in an
atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Coimmunoprecipitation
HEK293T cells were cotransfected with LRRK2 and APP plasmids
using Lipofectamine 2000 (#P/N 52887, Invitrogen). Cells were
collected 24 hours after transfection for Western blot analysis.
Transfected HEK293T cells were washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and lysed in M-PER mammalian protein extraction re-
agent buffer (#78501, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with
protease inhibitors (#11697498001, Roche). The lysates were then
incubated with antibody against LRRK2 (ab133474, Abcam) overnight
at 4°C. For reverse coimmunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with
antibody against Flag (F3165, Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4°C. Endog-
enous pull-down was performed using adult mouse brain lysates with
antibody against LRRK2 (NB300-268, Novus Biologicals) and antibody
against APP (#A8717, Sigma-Aldrich). The precipitates were then
washed five times using NP-40 buffer [50 mM tris (pH 7.4), 300 mM
NaCl, and 1% NP-40] and resuspended in 2× SDS loading buffer for
Western blot analysis.
LC/MS/MS analysis
Wild-type, full-length LRRK2 protein (1 ml; cat. no. A15197, 0.2 mg/
ml; Life Technologies) and recombinant human APP751 (10 ml; cat.
no. 842601, 0.1 mg/ml; BioLegend) were mixed with kinase assay
buffer [50 mM tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 50 mM MgCl2] and heated to
30°C. We added 10 ml of ATP solution [1 mM in 10 mM Hepes buffer
(pH 7.4)] and incubated for 30 min at 30°C. Laemmli buffer was added
to stop the reaction and loaded to a 4 to 12% SDS-PAGE gel (NuPAGE,
Thermo Fisher Scientific).
In-gel digestion was performed according to the standard
protocol. The LC/MS/MS analysis was carried out on an Orbitrap
Fusion (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The column was 20 cm × 75 mm
(inner diameter) home-packed with 3-mm C18 (Reprosil, Dr.
Maisch). The tryptic peptides were separated on a nano-UPLC
(Easy-nLC 1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with gradient from
0% mobile phase A (water with 0.1% formic acid) to 30% mobile
phase B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) in 30 min. The mass
spectrometer was configured to perform MS/MS (HCD) on top
abundant multiple-charged ions (400 to 1500 m/z) every 3 s.
The mass spectrometry and MS/MS spectra from the raw data were
sent to the Mascot (Matrix Science) database search engine against the
UniProt human protein database (90,441 sequences). The search pa-
rameters were peptide mass tolerance (7 ppm), fragment mass tolerance
(0.3 Da), enzyme (trypsin), maximum missed cleavages (1), fixed mod-
ification [carbamidomethyl (C)], and variable modifications [oxidation
(M) and phospho (ST)]. The quantification of phosphorylation was
based on the extracted ion chromatograph of the triply charged non-
phosphorylated and phosphorylated peptide containing Thr724.
Primary mouse cortical neuronal cultures
and electroporation
Primary cortical neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic day
16 (E16) Tg LRRK2G2019S mouse cortex. The cortex was dissected in
Hepes-buffered HBSS, incubated in 0.025% trypsin for 30 min, and
then washed with HBSS. We triturated brain tissues very gently with
a fire-polished glass Pasteur pipette with a reduced diameter (10 to
15 times) in seeding medium (DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS).
We allowed the cells to settle for 2 min and then removed the super-
natant to a new tube. Dissociated cells were counted for subsequent
experiments. Electroporation of the AICD, AICD mutant, and control
plasmids into primary neurons was performed using a Neon electro-
porator (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, 1 to 2 × 106 cells were resuspended in Nucleofector solution
and electroporated using a preestablished program. The electroporated
cells were plated on poly-L-lysine–coated four-well coverslips at a den-
sity of 0.5 to 0.7 × 106 cells per well. After 4 hours, the medium was
exchanged for feeding medium (Neurobasal containing GlutaMAX,
B27, andantibiotics). After48 hours, the transfected neurons were fixed,
permeabilized, and immunostained.
iPSC-induced human DA neuron cultures
Human LRRK2G2019S and control iPSCs were purchased from Coriell
Institute. All iPSCs were cultured in chemically defined mTeSR medium
(#05850, STEMCELL Technologies) on Matrigel-coated tissue culture
plates. Confluent cultures were passaged using Dispase (1 mg/ml;
#07923, STEMCELL Technologies) at a split ratio of 1:6 every 7 days.
For neuronal differentiation, iPSC colonies were detached using Dis-
pase (1 mg/ml; #07923, STEMCELL Technologies) and were split 1:6

ROCK inhibitor. Neural induction from iPSCs into neural progenitor
cells (NPCs) was initiated 1 day after passaging the iPSCs. At day 1,
mTeSR medium was replaced with N2B27 medium (DMEM/F12 with
2 mM L-glutamine and 1× N2 supplement and Neurobasal medium

 (#SCR005, Merck Millipore) and split on cell culture plates that were
coated with poly-L-ornithine hydrochloride and laminin. Starting
from day 8, NPCs were treated with mDA patterning medium con-
sisting of N2 and B27 media supplemented with fibroblast growth
factor 8 (100 ng/ml) (#100-25, PeproTech), 2 mM purmorphamine
(#540220, Merck Millipore), dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(db-cAMP; 300 ng/ml) (#D0627, Sigma-Aldrich), and 200 mM L-ascor-
bic acid (L-AA; #A4403, Sigma-Aldrich) for 14 days. From day 22, cells
were fed with maturation medium consisting of N2B27 medium sup-
plemented withhumanglialcellline–derivedneurotrophicfactor(20ng/ml;
#212-GD, R&D Systems), human brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(20 ng/ml; #248-BD, R&D Systems), 0.5 mM db-cAMP, and 200 mM
L-AA. mDA neuron differentiation cultures were replated as single cells
on days 36 to 40 on poly-L-ornithine hydrochloride and laminin-coated
plates for further experiments.
Subcellular fractions and Western blot analysis
Tissues or cells were lysed in the lysis buffer supplemented with pro-
tease inhibitors [50 mM Hepes (pH 7.3), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl flu-
oride, and aprotinin (10 mg/ml)]. Harvested protein lysates were
separated on 7 to 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to poly-
vinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (#IPVH00010, Millipore).
The blots were incubated with antibody against LRRK2 (1:1000;
ab133474, Abcam), APP (1:1000; A8717, Sigma-Aldrich), phospho-
APP Thr668 (1:1000; #3823S, Cell Signaling), TH (1:500; NB300-109,
Novus Biologicals), or b-actin (1:3000; sc-69879, Santa Cruz Bio-
technology) antibodies. For detection of the APP C-terminal fragment
(AICD) in the mouse midbrain, cellular fractionation was performed.
Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were extracted using the NE-PER
Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (#78835, Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Cytoplasmic and nuclear
extracts were separated by 4 to 20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Stain-Free
Precast gels (#456-8094, Bio-Rad) and transferred to a Trans-Blot Tur-
bo Transfer Pack with 0.2-mm PVDF (#170-4156, Bio-Rad). The blots
were probed with antibody against b-tubulin (1:3000; #05-661, Milli-
pore) to detect the cytosolic fraction and antibody against HDAC1
(1:1000; #06-720, Millipore) to detect the nuclear fraction. The mem-
branes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C in
TBST (tris-buffered saline–Tween 20) supplemented with 5% skim
milk, washed in TBST, and then incubated with secondary horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated antibody against mouse IgG (#NA931V,
GE Healthcare) or HRP-conjugated antibody against rabbit IgG
(#NA934V, GE Healthcare) and developed using an ECL detection
kit (#RPN2106, GE Healthcare) or a SuperSignal West Femto detection
kit (#34096, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Immunohistochemistry and intranuclear
intensity measurement
Animals were anesthetized and intracardially perfused with ice-cold
PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer.
The brains were removed and fixed in the same fixative. After cryopro-
tection with 30% sucrose, a complete set of 30-mm-thick serial sections
was cut through the SN on a freezing microtome (#CM3050S model,
Leica). Every sixth section was selected. Free-floating sections in one
group were blocked in 10% goat serum plus 0.3% Triton X-100 and in-
cubated with antibodies against phospho-APP (#3823S, Cell Signaling)
and TH (#MAB318, Millipore), followed by incubation with streptavi-
din–Alexa 488 (1:500; #S-11223, Invitrogen) and donkey against mouse
Alexa 555 (1:500; #A-31570, Invitrogen) secondary antibodies. Nuclei
were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
(1:200; #268298, Calbiochem). Finally, sections were mounted on glass
slides. Images were acquired with a confocal microscope (Olympus).
The fluorescence intensities of phosphorylated APP in nuclear fraction
were measured by analyzing the images with ImageJ software.
Luciferase assay
The day before transfection, HEK293T cells were cultured in 24-well
plates and then transiently cotransfected with the following constructs:
0.1 mg per well of pG5E1B and APP-Gal4 or C99-Gal4, luciferase inter-
nal control plasmid pCMV-b-Gal and 0.05 mg per well of LRRK2 or
LRRK2G2019S or LRRK2D1994A overexpression constructs using Lipo-
fectamine reagent (#18324-012, Life Technologies). Cells were har-
vested 24 to 48 hours after transfection, and luciferase activity was
measured with the Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay Kit (E2510, Promega)
using a GloMAX 20/20 luminometer (Promega). Luciferase activity
was normalized to pCMV-b-Gal luciferase activity.
Lentivirus production
Lentivirus was prepared according to the established protocols. Briefly,
lentivirus packaging was performed by cotransfecting lentivectors with
pLP, VSV-G (Invitrogen), and psPAX2 (Addgene plasmid #12260) into
293FT cells cultured in Opti-MEM I medium using Lipofectamine 2000
(all from Invitrogen). Culture supernatant was collected on day 2 and 3
aftertransfectionandpassedthrougha0.45-mmfilter.Viralparticleswere
concentrated from culture supernatants by ultracentrifugation through a
20%sucrosecushionat20,000rpminanSW28rotor(BeckmanCoulter)
for3 hoursat 4°C. Viralpelletsused forin vivo delivery were resuspended
in a minimal volume of HBSS (Invitrogen), whereas pellets for neuronal
transduction were resuspended in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen).
Lentivirus in vivo delivery
For stereotaxic injection of lentivirus particles overexpressing control,
AICD, and mutant AICD, experimental procedures were followed
according to the guidelines of the Laboratory Animal Manual of the
NNI Guide for the Care and Use of Animals. All procedures used in
this study were approved by the NNI Animal Care Committee and the
NNI IACUC. Twelve-month-old LRRK2G2019S Tg mice were anesthe-
tized using 2% xylazine and 10% ketamine and placed in a Kopf ste-
reotaxic frame. For nigrostriatal transduction, either lentivirally
expressed control, AICD, or mutant AICDT668A infectious particles
was injected bilaterally into the striatum (anterior/posterior, +1.2 mm;
medial/lateral, −1.3 mm; and dorsal/ventral, −3.2 mm) (2 ml per site)
at a rate of 0.25 ml/min with a 5-ml Hamilton syringe (25 gauge) driven
by a Harvard pump. After infusion, the cannula remained in place for
4 min to prevent reflux. Each lentivirus particle was injected into least
six sites in different mice brains.
Three weeks after injection, animals were perfused with 1× PBS
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were postfixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, and processed
for immunohistochemistry. Thirty-micrometer coronal sections
were cut throughout the brain, including the striatum and SN. Every
sixth section was taken for TH staining.
In vitro kinase assay
Invitro kinase assay was carried out using recombinant LRRK2 protein
(cat. no. A15197, Life Technologies), ATP (Sigma-Aldrich), kinase
buffer (Cell Signaling), and purified APP–glutathione S-transferase

 (GST) protein. The kinase assay was carried out for 2 hours at room
temperature and was stopped by adding 2× SDS loading buffer and
boiled for 5 min at 95°C. The protein was loaded on SDS-PAGE gel,
and APP phosphorylation was detected by antibody against phospho-
APP T668.
In vitro toxicity assay
Neuronal toxicity assay includes cell death and neurite shortening
(neural injury) assays. For cell death assays, neurons were subject to
TUNEL and DAPI staining following the manufacturer’s protocols
and then visualized using a confocal microscope (Olympus). For
neurite shortening assays, healthy neurons were defined as having
at least one smooth neurite extension that was twice the length of
the cell body (25, 26), whereas injured neurons were defined as those
with neurite extensions that were less than twice the length of the cell
body. The ratio of injured neurons to the total number of viable cells
was assessed.
DAB staining and stereology counting
For TH DAB staining, brain sections were reacted with a 1:1000 dilu-
tion of mouse monoclonal antibody against TH (MAB318, Millipore)
and visualized with biotinylated goat against mouse IgG, followed by
streptavidin-conjugated HRP (Mouse on Mouse kit, PK-2200, Vector
Laboratories). Positive immunostaining was visualized with DAB after
reaction with hydrogen peroxide (DAB kit, SK-4100, Vector Labora-
tories). Total numbers of TH-stained neurons in substantia nigra pars
compacta were counted using the stereological cell counting with the
Optical Fractionator probe of the Stereologer 2000 software.
Statistical analyses
For each experiment, at least three independent experiments were per-
formed. The images obtained from one representative experiment
were presented. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Data
were presented as mean ± SD for Western blotting and cell counting
quantification. For two-group comparisons, two-tailed Student’s t test
was performed. Paired t test was used to evaluate TH viability after
virus injection in 12-month-old mice. For multiple comparisons, data
with a normal distribution were analyzed by one-way ANOVA
followed by the Tukey’s HSD test. The investigators were blinded to
genotypes during experiments involving immunohistochemical
counting. Significance level was set at P < 0.05.
