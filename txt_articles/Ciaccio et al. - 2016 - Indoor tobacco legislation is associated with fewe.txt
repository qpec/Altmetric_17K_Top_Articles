Introduction
Over the past three decades, numerous cities and states have adopted laws that ban smoking 
in public indoor spaces, including hotels, workplaces, restaurants, and bars. The rationale for 
these policies is to protect nonsmokers from the numerous adverse health effects of second 
hand smoke. One population that is particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of second 
hand smoke exposure is children as they typically have little or no control over their 
surrounding environment. As approximately 8% of children now have asthma and second 
hand tobacco smoke is a known trigger for asthma exacerbation, these policies would ideally 
decrease asthma exacerbation; however, little is known of about the overall impact of these 
local and state policies on protecting children from severe asthma exacerbations.1

 Common triggers for asthma exacerbations in children include allergens, (such as animal 
dander, pollens, molds, and pests), weather changes, upper respiratory infections, influenza, 
and inhaled irritants such as tobacco smoke.2 National campaigns have emphasized 
vaccinations and hand hygiene to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases that may 
trigger asthma exacerbations. Few other triggers, however, have potential to be controlled 
and/or reduced by public policy, except for indoor and outdoor air quality, particularly 
tobacco smoke exposure. Although national campaigns have also increased awareness of the 
adverse effects of smoking tobacco, children may still be adversely influenced by smoke 
exposure in restaurants and other public spaces. As medical expenses related to asthma now 
exceed $70 billion a year, the implementation of smoking bans in indoor public spaces not 
only has the potential to significantly decrease the incidence of asthma exacerbation in 
children but also to lead to an overall significant decrease in the costs associated with this 
disease by protecting this vulnerable population from this potent asthma trigger.3
This study assesses the association between municipal and state indoor smoking legislation 
and severe asthma exacerbation resulting in emergency department visits to pediatric 
hospitals. We hypothesized that despite variations in policy among cities and states, 
restricting smoking in public indoor spaces would be associated with an overall decrease in 
the incidence of emergency department visits for asthma exacerbation in children.
Methods
Study Design and Setting
This study design was a retrospective, secondary data analysis capitalizing on a natural 
experiment to estimate the impact of clean indoor air legislation on the rate of emergency 
department (ED) admissions for asthma exacerbation. The study sample was limited to 
children under the age of 18 who were treated at a pediatric hospital. Data from the twenty 
United States children’s hospitals in which a complete data set was available were included 
covering 3 years prior to indoor smoking legislation until 3 years after implementation of 
indoor smoking legislation for the region surrounding the hospital. This study was approved 
by our local hospital Institutional Review Board and the deidentified data were analyzed.
Participants
Metropolitan areas were included if 1) the metropolitan area had a local children’s hospital 
that contributes data to the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) and if 2) ED data 
were available in PHIS for 3 years prior to indoor smoking legislation and 3 years post 
indoor smoking legislation for the area surrounding the hospital. Data were not available for 
any metropolitan area that allowed indoor smoking in public buildings to use as “controls”.
Data Sources and Variables
PHIS contains inpatient, ED, ambulatory surgery and observation data from 44 not-for-
profit, tertiary care pediatric hospitals in the United States. These hospitals are affiliated with 
the Children’s Hospital Association (Overland Park, KS), which serves as the data 
repository for these secondary data. Data quality and reliability are assured through a joint 
effort between the Children’s Hospital Association and participating hospitals. The data

 warehouse function for the PHIS database is managed by Truven Health Analytics (Ann 
Arbor, MI). For the purposes of external benchmarking, participating hospitals provide 
discharge/encounter data including demographics, diagnoses, and procedures. Data are de-
identified at the time of data submission, and data are subjected to a number of reliability 
and validity checks before being included in the database. It has been estimated that this 
database captures approximately 15% of all pediatric admissions across the country.4–6
We obtained data for all ED visits by children under the age of 18 with a primary discharge 
diagnosis of asthma (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code 493) 
utilizing PHIS. Date of discharge, admit age in years, gender, race, payer source, and cost of 
visit were also downloaded from the PHIS database.
The remaining data were retrieved from publicly available records. Dates of indoor smoking 
legislation for each metropolitan area were determined from the Americans for Nonsmokers’ 
Rights website and Wikipedia then confirmed on local/regional websites.7,8 Population 
estimates (<18 years of age) for each metropolitan statistical area (MSA) for each included 
year were obtained from the United States Census Bureau and used as the denominators in 
rate calculations.9
Measures
Dependent variable/Outcome measure: The primary outcome measure was the rate of ED 
visits for asthma each day. The number of ED admissions for asthma was counted for each 
day. As asthma exacerbations were counted rather than individuals, individual children may 
be included in the analyses more than once. Rates were calculated by dividing the number of 
ED admissions for each day by the child population of the MSA for the respective year.
Independent Variables/Covariates/Adjusters: Independent variables were as follows. A 
dummy variable was coded to test the impact of legislation with 0 indicating an event prior 
to legislation in the region surrounding the hospital and 1 indicating an event after legislation 
in the same region. In order to account for seasonal variation in asthma exacerbation, first 
and second order harmonics were included in the model as was done in a related type of 
analysis.10 In order to control for secular linear time trends in asthma, a variable was created 
that assigned a unique number 1–163 for each month beginning January 2000 to July 2013. 
Results were unchanged when the linear time trend was replaced with separate indicator 
variables for each month in the data. Finally, gender, black race, payer source (Medicaid 
versus all other) and admit age were included in the adjusted model.
Statistical Analysis
Poisson regression with negative binomial distribution to account for overdispersion was 
used to model the rate of ED visits for asthma exacerbation for combined and local data and 
results are presented as rate ratios (RR). Records with missing covariates were retained in 
the final model. It is possible that our policy measures, which change from zero to one at the 
time of the smoking legislation, are just capturing temporal variations in ED rates. To 
mitigate this concern, we conducted a falsification test where we assigned an arbitrary date 
of January 1, 2007 for our policy variable in all locations. We expected to find no

 statistically significant policy effect in this placebo test. All analyses were conducted using 
SAS software version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Pacific Grove, CA).
RESULTS
For the cities that contribute to the PHIS database, indoor tobacco legislation was 
implemented between January 1, 1990 (Norfolk, VA) and June 4, 2012 (Birmingham, AL). 
Almost half of the included municipalities (19 of 43) implemented indoor tobacco 
legislation between the years 2006 and 2008. At the time we accessed the data (second 
quarter of 2014), 20 of the 44 hospitals which participate in PHIS had data available for 3 
years prior to implementation of indoor smoking legislation and 3 years after 
implementation. These 20 hospitals were located in 14 different states plus the District of 
Columbia. A total of 335,588 asthma ED visits were captured from these hospitals from July 
2000 to January 2014. Included hospitals, the relevant MSA, the estimated population 
(children <18) for the MSA at the time of smoke free ordinance, and the dates of 
implementation of the smoking ordinance are included in Table 1.
The impact of indoor tobacco legislation in each individual metropolitan area varied. A 
statistically significant reduction was found in four urban regions and ranged from 5% to 
15% in adjusted analyses (secular trends, seasonality, male gender, Medicaid status, black 
race, and age). However, two cities had a statistically significant increase rate in ED visits 
for asthma in children despite indoor tobacco legislation (adjusted RR=1.14 and 1.44). 
These results are summarized in Table 2.
In the pooled results, indoor smoking legislation was associated with a 17% decrease in 
childhood ED visits for asthma exacerbation between the 3 years prior to law 
implementation and 3 years after law implementation after controlling for secular trends, 
seasonality, male gender, Medicaid status, black race, and age (adjusted RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 
0.82 to 0.85; p<0.001). An appreciable and increasing rate reduction was also seen after only 
1 year post law implementation (adjusted RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.90 to 0.94; p<0.001) as well 
as 2 years after law implementation (adjusted RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.85 to 0.88; p<0.001). 
These results are included in Table 3.
Results for our falsification test are included in Table 4. We found no statistically significant 
relationship between our placebo policy measure and ED visits in all but the 2 year 
estimation; however, in the case of the 2 year estimation, the rate ratio estimates are nearly 
one (adjusted RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94 to 0.98; p<0.0001). Lack of meaningful effects in the 
falsification test increase our confidence that we are capturing true policy effects in our 
baseline models.
DISCUSSION
The objective of our analysis was to examine the impact of indoor smoking legislation in the 
US on pediatric asthma exacerbations that lead to emergency room visits. Considering three 
years pre- and post-legislation data pooled across 20 geographic locations, we found that 
indoor smoking legislation was associated with a 17% decrease in the incidence of severe

 asthma emergency room visits. Significant decreases also occurred within one year and two 
year time windows. The absolute degree of reduction varied across metropolitan areas.
These results overall support the importance of widespread restriction of smoking in public 
places on the respiratory health of children. States and metropolitan areas that have yet to 
implement such protective laws should consider new ordinances in order to protect the 
respiratory health of their children. As of January 2014, ten states remained with no general 
statewide ban on indoor smoking: Alabama, Alaska, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, 
Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming. In addition, Oklahoma 
remains the only state in which state law prohibits local governments from regulating 
smoking more strictly than the state. As most major metropolitan areas have implemented 
indoor smoking bans despite the lack of a statewide ban, Oklahoma is the only state without 
any legislated smoking bans7–8.
The results of this study are corroborated by similar findings from previous studies on both a 
national and regional level. Rayens et al reported a very similar 18% (95% CI, 4% to 29%) 
decline in childhood ED visits for asthma in Lexington-Fayette County, Kentucky after 
implementation of indoor smoking legislation. Their study also found a 24% (95% CI, 16% 
to 31%) decrease in adults with a total reduction across all ages of 22% (95% CI 14% to 
29%).10 A second study in 2010 by Mackay et al reported an 18.2% (95% CI, 14.7% to 
21.8%) decrease in hospital admissions for asthma in Scotland in both preschool and school-
age children after analyzing over 21,000 hospital admissions for asthma over a 9 year 
period.11 The publication of the latter study was followed by a Letter to the Editor of the 
Journal which also described a 30.7% (95% CI, 22.8% to 38.6%) decrease in asthma 
admissions in the Lombardy region of Italy after analyzing over 15,000 asthma 
admissions.12 Finally, Millett et al described a 9% (95% CI, 7% to 11%) decrease in 
pediatric asthma admissions after smoke-free legislation in England in 2007.13 These results 
collectively support the findings of this study as well as the positive impact of indoor 
tobacco legislation on pediatric asthma.
To our knowledge only one study has been published that failed to find that indoor tobacco 
legislation had an impact on asthma exacerbation in children. In 2013, Gaudreau et al 
analyzed discharge data from the Prince Edward Island Discharge Abstract Database, a 
validated Canadian database which captures all admissions of Prince Edward Island with 
Provincial Health Numbers.14 Although a decrease in acute myocardial infarction post-ban 
was seen, the Prince Edward Island legislation was not found to decrease pediatric or adult 
asthma admissions (OR 1.48 95% CI, 0.90 to 2.41). The Prince Edward Island tobacco 
legislation, however, was unique from legislation implemented in Scotland, England, and 
most United States cities in that the original 2003 ban still allowed smoking in bars and 
restaurants in designated smoking rooms.15 It has been shown that separate smoking areas 
with or without separate ventilation does not protect nonsmokers from second hand 
smoke.16,17 Presumably, restaurants are a major source of second hand tobacco exposure in 
children outside of the home environment, and therefore, the Canadian legislation in its 2003 
form may have been inadequate to protect children (or adults) with asthma.

 These data identified two cities in which emergency department visits for asthma in children 
increased despite legislation. One metropolitan area was struck with natural disaster near the 
time of implementation of indoor tobacco legislation. As such, any short term benefit of the 
legislation in this city was likely blunted by several environmental and social factors. The 
increase in emergency department visits for asthma seen at the other identified city was 
likely artifact due to the implementation of a marketing campaign across the respective 
metropolitan area advertising a new asthma center and known effort on the part of the 
institution to increase access to and quality of asthma care around the time of law 
implementation. This likely influenced families with an asthmatic child to transfer care to 
this institution (personal communication with local asthma center).
The strength of this paper is the innovative approach used to understand the impact of public 
health legislation. Because of the many variables that impact asthma exacerbations, 
accessing large amounts of data is essential to have appropriate power to determine if indoor 
smoking legislation is significantly associated with a lower rate of asthma ED admissions. 
This is exemplified by the inability to determine significance in the small, individual MSA 
datasets. The collaborative approach that many pediatric hospitals have taken by pooling 
their billing data into one, unified data warehouse has proven to be an effective strategy to 
make observations that would otherwise not be feasible.
These findings should be interpreted with full knowledge of the study’s limitations. First, 
this study was designed to determine association, not causation, and should therefore be 
interpreted as such. A randomized controlled trial, however, designed to determine causation 
is not feasible because of the ethical implications of knowingly subjecting children to second 
hand smoke. Therefore, epidemiologic studies are an essential method to determining the 
impact of indoor tobacco legislation. Second, this study is attempting to associate a decrease 
in asthma exacerbation with implementation of several unique, regional legislations. As no 
national indoor smoking legislation exists, a comparison of unique legislations was also 
necessary and exemplified by the fact that no difference in rates existed pre- and post- indoor 
tobacco legislation, with several of the smaller datasets obtained from one regional hospital 
within each MSA. This limitation is also likely to have minimal influence in the findings as 
the major source of variability in each policy was the inclusion or exclusion of bars, casinos, 
and/or other age restricted environments which are unlikely to have a significant impact on 
children. Third, since all of the pediatric hospitals who contribute data to PHIS are in 
metropolitan areas that have passed indoor smoking legislation, we did not have control 
locations. We attempted to address this concern by using historical comparisons and varying 
time windows. We also included a falsification test to address concerns about temporal 
trends in asthma ED visits. In addition, each hospital included was a nonprofit tertiary care 
pediatric hospital in an urban area, and therefore, the results may not be generalizable to all 
areas of the country. Finally, as each pediatric hospital which participates in PHIS has 
unique billing and coding systems, institutional variability in these data may exist; however, 
we also believe this to be a minor limitation as the PHIS system is supported by a robust 
data quality program.
In summary, these multi-regional data show a significant decrease in ED visits due to asthma 
in children is associated with the implementation of indoor tobacco legislation. Since

 government taxes are typically a significant contributor to fund the cost of children’s 
healthcare, action should be considered in localities that yet remain without indoor tobacco 
legislation in order to both protect children of the state as well as to allow redistribution of 
the significant dollars spent on emergency department visits for asthma in these children.
