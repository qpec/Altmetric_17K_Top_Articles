Medical Centre Delft, Delft, the Netherlands
Background: CrossFit is a strength and conditioning program that has gained widespread recognition, with 11,000 affiliated gyms
worldwide. The incidence of injuries during CrossFit training is poorly analyzed.
Purpose: To investigate the incidence of injuries for persons participating in CrossFit. Risk factors for injury and injury mechanisms
were also explored through athlete demographics and characteristics.
Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study.
Methods: A questionnaire that focused on injury incidence in CrossFit in the past year and included data on athlete demographics
and characteristics was distributed to all 130 CrossFit gyms in the Netherlands and was also available online in active Facebook
groups. Data were collected from July 2015 to January 2016. Inclusion criteria consisted of age �18 years and training at a registered
CrossFit gym in the Netherlands. A total of 553 participants completed the survey. Univariable and multivariable generalized linear
mixed models were used to identify potential risk factors for injury.
Results: A total of 449 participants met the inclusion criteria. Of all respondents, 252 athletes (56.1%) sustained an injury in the
preceding 12 months. The most injured body parts were the shoulder (n ¼ 87, 28.7%), lower back (n ¼ 48, 15.8%), and knee
(n ¼ 25, 8.3%). The duration of participation in CrossFit significantly affected the injury incidence rates (<6 months vs �24 months;
odds ratio, 3.687 [95% CI, 2.091-6.502]; P < .001). The majority of injuries were caused by overuse (n ¼ 148, 58.7%).
Conclusion: The injury incidence for athletes participating in CrossFit was 56.1%. The most frequent injury locations were the
shoulder, lower back, and knee. A short duration of participation (<6 months) was significantly associated with an increased risk for
injury.

CrossFit defines itself as a “constantly varied, high inten-
sity, functional movement” strength and conditioning
program. The aim of the sport is to forge broad, general,
and inclusive fitness, preparing its trainees for any physi-
cal contingency.12 Since its invention in the year 2000,
CrossFit has seen a rising popularity with over 11,000 affil-
iated gyms worldwide and has gained widespread recogni-
tion. There are approximately 130 registered CrossFit
gyms in the Netherlands with approximately 15,000 ath-
letes. There are also unregistered gyms that offer CrossFit
but do not meet the instructor requirements and do not pay
the license to use the name “CrossFit.”8 The number of
unregistered gyms and participants is unknown.
Typical exercises include a wide variety of sports, ranging
from Olympic weightlifting to running and rowing, kettle-
bells and other odd-shaped objects, gymnastics, and
powerlifting.
The program is usually formed by “workouts of the day”
(WODs). WODs are designed to include functional move-
ments in various patterns executed at high intensity. Each
WOD can be scaled to allow participation regardless of
strength and fitness levels. CrossFit has been adopted in
both military and civilian populations, with widespread
reports of fitness and other health-related gains, and has
been shown to improve physical fitness in a heterogeneous
group of people.9,18,22,25

 Incidence data of injuries during CrossFit training are
sparse.17 Two observational studies have examined the
injury rate in CrossFit and suggest that it is similar
to other sports and exercise programs.13,29 However, both
studies have been criticized because of their methodolog-
ical limitations. Therefore, accurate data on the injury
prevalence, rates, and patterns among CrossFit athletes
are needed.1-4 CrossFit has been criticized as having a
potentially disproportionate risk of musculoskeletal
injury, and research on injury rates and risk factors for
injury are recommended.5,17
The injury rates from the various sports that are blended
into CrossFit are known6,7,15,16,20,23,24; however, they cannot
be applied to CrossFit because of the combination that is
used compared with the single modality form of the original
sport. Analyzing injury rates and patterns for CrossFit is the
first step of injury prevention during CrossFit training, as
described in the “injury prevention model.”28
Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the incidence
of injuries for athletes participating in CrossFit. Potential
risk factors for injury and injury mechanisms were also
explored as a secondary aim.
METHODS
Study Design
Study data were collected via an electronic survey using
SurveyMonkey from July 2015 to January 2016 and hosted
at the Department of Orthopaedics, Reinier de Graaf
Gasthuis, Medical Centre Delft. The study protocol was
assessed by the regional medical ethics committee, and no
ethics approval was necessary because it did not fall under
the scope of the Medical Research Involving Human Sub-
jects Act.
A musculoskeletal injury was defined as applied in prior
research29: any new musculoskeletal pain, feeling, or dis-
comfort as a result of a CrossFit workout that met 1 of the
following criteria:
�
Total removal from CrossFit training and other outside
routine physical activities for >1 week.
�
Modification of normal training activities in duration,
intensity, or mode for >2 weeks.
�
Any physical complaint severe enough to warrant a visit
to a health professional.
Data Collection
All CrossFit gym owners in the Netherlands were identified
through maps.crossfit.com (which has an overview of all
registered and affiliated CrossFit gyms) and were sent a
link to our online survey via email. There are approxi-
mately 130 CrossFit gyms in the Netherlands. We asked
each gym to encourage their members to complete the
online survey. We also posted a link to the online survey
in the active Facebook group “CrossFit Nederland.” All
adult athletes training at a CrossFit gym in the Nether-
lands were invited to participate in our study by completing
the online survey. Participation was voluntary, and parti-
cipants were informed that completion of the survey
implied their consent to participate.
Inclusion criteria were age �18 years and training at a
CrossFit gym in the Netherlands. Exclusion criteria con-
sisted of training independently outside of a CrossFit gym
and training at a CrossFit gym outside the Netherlands.
Participants completed a single survey (see the Appen-
dix), which focused on the incidence of musculoskeletal
injuries during CrossFit training in the preceding year and
any injuries sustained during CrossFit training in the past.
The survey was based on the study by Weisenthal et al,29
which assessed injury rates and patterns among CrossFit
athletes in the United States. Athlete demographics and
characteristics were also obtained.
Statistical Analysis
Injury data were reported based on athlete demographics
and characteristics. The associations between each variable
and injury during CrossFit training were examined using
logistic regressions and univariable analyses to estimate
the odds ratios (ORs). The outcome variable of the logistic
regressions was dichotomous: injury versus no injury. Fac-
tors determined to be associated with the outcome via uni-
variable analyses (P < .10) were included in a multivariable
logistic regression. Risk factors found to be significantly
associated with injury in prior research13,29 were also
included in the multivariable logistic regression. In the
multivariable regression, P < .05 was considered statisti-
cally significant. Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS Statistics version 24 (IBM Corp).
RESULTS
Athlete Demographics and Characteristics
A total of 553 athletes completed the survey, of whom 449
met the inclusion criteria. Figure 1 provides a flowchart of
potentially eligible participants in the study, and Table 1
provides the demographic data of the 449 included athletes.
The majority of our study population achieved higher edu-
cation or college (n ¼ 326, 72.6%), and 183 (40.8%) respon-
dents had sedentary jobs.
Athlete characteristics are shown in Table 2. Approxi-
mately 20% of our study population consisted of beginners,
with a duration of participation in CrossFit of less than
6 months (n ¼ 88, 19.6%). Training sessions lasted 30 to
60 minutes for most participants (n ¼ 249, 55.5%). The
majority of the included CrossFit gyms provided a begin-
ners’ program (n ¼ 397, 88.4%), which was mandatory for
the majority of participants (n ¼ 314, 79.1%) and sometimes
voluntary (n ¼ 83, 20.9%).
Injury Characteristics
Of all respondents, 252 athletes (56.1%) sustained an injury
in the preceding 12 months. A total of 68 athletes (15.2%)
sustained �2 injuries (Table 3). The most injured body
2

 parts were the shoulder (n ¼ 87, 28.7%), lower back (n ¼ 48,
15.8%), and knee (n ¼ 25, 8.3%) (Figure 2). Injuries were
most frequent during WODs (n ¼ 100, 39.7%); other times
of injury included during strength training (n ¼ 54, 21.4%),
skill training (n ¼ 23, 9.1%), condition training (n ¼ 10,
4.0%), or unknown (n ¼ 42, 16.7%).
Medical professionals diagnosed 77.4% (n ¼ 195) of all
injuries, the majority of which were reported as chronic/
overuse in nature (n ¼ 148, 58.7%). We asked the athletes
what they thought might have caused their injury; possible
causes included bad/incorrect form (n ¼ 75, 20.5%), fatigue
(n ¼ 74, 20.2%), too heavy of weight (n ¼ 59, 16.1%),
unknown (n ¼ 37, 10.1%), relapse of an old injury (n ¼
34, 9.3%), and too little or bad coaching (n ¼ 6, 1.6%). The
majority of athletes reported that they did not feel any dis-
comfort, pain, or stiffness in the week before the injury (n ¼
149, 59.1%).
Injury Rate Analysis
Results of the univariable and multivariable models are
presented in Table 4. All variables with P < .10 were used
for the multivariable analysis, which included age (increas-
ing) (OR, 0.979 [95% CI, 0.947-0.992]; P ¼ .009), duration of
participation in CrossFit for 0 to 6 months (OR, 3.687 [95%
CI, 2.091-6.502]; P < .001), and sports activities in addition
to CrossFit (OR, 1.172 [95% CI, 0.995-1.381]; P ¼ .058). We
also added sex to the multivariable analysis because of its
significance in prior research. After performing a step-by-
step backward model for the multivariable analysis, dura-
tion of participation in CrossFit for 0 to 6 months was the
only independent risk factor for injury (OR, 3.687 [95% CI,
2.091-6.502]; P < .001).
DISCUSSION
The injury incidence rate in CrossFit athletes among the
cohort in this study was 56.1%. The most frequent injury
locations were the shoulder, lower back, and knee. A short

 duration of CrossFit participation (<6 months) was signifi-
cantly associated with an increased injury risk.
A comparison of the existing literature aids in under-
standing this high injury incidence. A recent study con-
ducted by Sprey et al27 in Brazil observed an injury
incidence rate of 31% for CrossFit athletes. Earlier studies
that examined injuries in CrossFit found injury incidence
rates of 19.4%29 and 73.5%.13 However, the definition used
in these epidemiology studies for an “injury” certainly influ-
ences the results. We used a strict definition, which was
in accordance with the definition used in the studies of
Weisenthal et al29 and Sprey et al.27 Hak et al13 defined
an injury as “any injury sustained during training that
prevented the participant from training, working, or com-
peting in any way and for any period of time.” This broad
and unspecific definition may explain the high injury inci-
dence rate of 73.5% reported in that study.
Despite using a similar definition of injury, our injury
incidence rate is higher than those of Weisenthal et al29
and Sprey et al.27 We hypothesize that this can be
explained by demographic, environmental, and methodo-
logical differences. For example, the popularity of Cross-
Fit is different within the 3 countries where the studies
were conducted. Also, there may be differences in the
practice of CrossFit, the programming, and the knowledge
of the coaches, which can have an impact on the injury
incidence rate. We also distributed the survey through
member groups on the Facebook page of CrossFit gyms,
which enabled us to reach CrossFit athletes more directly
compared with only posting a link to the survey online.
The argument for the definition that we used was 3-fold.
Because of the constantly varied programming, CrossFit
athletes are often sore or have some discomfort as a result
of their training. This can result in an inability to exercise
in the days following a CrossFit workout. It is unclear
whether the discomfort felt by these athletes is better
categorized as soreness or as an injury. Sports medicine
physicians and CrossFit athletes reported that 1 week
was usually the time needed to differentiate the discomfort
that they felt as soreness (<1 week) or an injury (>1
week).29 Also, as athletes perform all kinds of different exer-
cises from a wide variety of sports during CrossFit training,
they can modify their training around their current inju-
ries.12,29 For example, an athlete sustaining an upper
body/limb injury is still able to continue CrossFit by training
his or her legs. Most athletes have reported that modifica-
tion for more than 2 weeks meant that the injury would not
heal without medical attention. Although these criteria were
not validated, we believe that they were concrete and cov-
ered the variety of injuries that are seen in CrossFit, as the
criteria were established by physicians, athletes, gym own-
ers, and coaches.29
Because we did not calculate an injury rate (injures per
1000 hours of training) and because definitions of injury
vary by study and sport, we have to be cautious when com-
paring injury incidence rates from our study with the
results of others. When compared with soccer, we found
injury incidence rates ranging from 57%26 to 62%.19 How-
ever, an injury was defined as “any physical complaint sus-
tained by a player resulting from a soccer match or soccer
training session and leading to the player’s being unable to
fully take part in a soccer activity on the day after the
injury,”10 and therefore, comparison is difficult. Another
difference is that we collected the data directly from the
athletes in contrast to other studies in which injuries were
registered by physicians or physical therapists.
The most injured body parts were the shoulder, lower
back, and knee. This is in accordance with previous
research performed in the United States regarding injuries
in CrossFit.29 Also, in comparison, the same predominance
of injured body parts is found in the sports that are blended
into CrossFit: Olympic weightlifters and powerlifters injure

 the shoulder, lower back, and knee most frequently7,16,23,24;
gymnasts injure the shoulder most frequently6; and run-
ners injure the knee and lower leg.15,20
In our study population, the risk of injury was signifi-
cantly increased in athletes participating in CrossFit for
less than 6 months. This finding is important; we suggest
that coaches and athletes focus on correct movement
patterns and scale workouts for beginners. This is possible
through a beginners’ program, which 88.4% of the
included CrossFit gyms had. Despite these beginners’ pro-
grams, we still found beginners to be more at risk of being
injured. Every CrossFit gym has a different beginners’
program; therefore, the quality of coaching might vary.
Also, CrossFit workouts can be scaled to allow participa-
tion regardless of strength and fitness levels. If beginners
do not scale or scale incorrectly, they may be more prone to
injuries due to overuse and the complexity of the workouts
and movements, as we found that the majority of injuries
were chronic/overuse in nature. This may be fixed by coa-
ches through correction of the volume, complexity, and
intensity of the workouts for beginners. Unfortunately,
these are merely suggestions, as there is no supporting
literature yet. Previous research has found that higher
levels of coaches’ involvement (all the time, most of the
time, sometimes, or never) is associated with a decreased
risk of injuries.29
When an athlete is new (beginner) at a certain sport and
then increases volume and intensity over a short period of
time, a higher rate of injury can be expected. This pattern
has been observed in rowing14 and skiing,21 which are
sports in which athletes also start participation at an older
age and tend to increase volume and intensity rapidly, for
instance, during winter holidays or collegiate rowing. The
mean age in our study was 31.9 years, which is comparable
with previous research at 31.3 years.27 This raises the issue
of the profile of the beginner itself; if beginners increase the
volume and intensity of training rapidly, injuries that are
chronic/overuse in nature can be expected.
This study has several limitations. Because we distrib-
uted our survey electronically, this may have generated a
selection bias, as certain athletes might have felt more
inclined to answer the survey. The studied cohort may not
reflect the overall population that participates in CrossFit
because of the potential selection bias and as the exact
number of CrossFit participants in the Netherlands is
currently unknown. For example, athletes who sustained
multiple injuries or a certain type of injury might have
been more likely to complete the questionnaire. Addition-
ally, older and more educated athletes may have been
more likely to complete the survey. We posted the link
to our survey online and asked CrossFit gym owners to
share the link with their members. Some CrossFit gym
owners gave us permission to temporarily join their mem-
bers’ group on Facebook to reach out to the CrossFit athletes
more directly. Also, because we only reached active CrossFit
athletes, we may have missed injured athletes who dropped
out of CrossFit. Furthermore, there was no physician vali-
dation of the injuries; we collected the data directly from the
athletes, which leaves space for personal interpretation.
Moreover, the retrospective nature of the study design
introduces the possibility of recall bias.
The validity of a self-reported, 12-month sports injury
history has been assessed in a prior study.11 There was
perfect recall whether an injury was sustained during that
period, with a decreasing percentage of athletes recalling
specific factors such as body parts injured or diagnoses.11
Therefore, we can assume that the injury incidence rate is

 reported correctly, with decreasing accuracy of the reported
specific injury characteristics such as body part and diag-
noses. These potential biases might cause an overestima-
tion of injured athletes and the injury incidence rate.
Despite these limitations, our study has made a first step
for injury prevention in CrossFit training. We examined
the injury incidence rate for athletes participating in Cross-
Fit and explored risk factors for injury and injury mechan-
isms. Our findings regarding the demographic and injury
characteristic profile provide insight for physicians, coa-
ches, and athletes and can be used for further research.
Future research is required to expand the scientific
knowledge of injury characteristics in CrossFit. Now that
we have gained insight into the demographic and injury
characteristic profiles of CrossFit athletes and have identi-
fied factors associated with injury patterns, the next step
for injury prevention is to perform a prospective study
examining injury characteristics and analyzing the profile
of beginners versus advanced CrossFit athletes to investi-
gate potential causes and mechanisms of injury.
CONCLUSION
The injury incidence rate for athletes participating in
CrossFit among the studied cohort was 56.1%. The most
commonly injured body parts were the shoulder, lower
back, and knee. A short duration of CrossFit participation
was significantly associated with an increased risk of
injury. These results provide useful information as a basis
for future injury prevention research in CrossFit athletes.
