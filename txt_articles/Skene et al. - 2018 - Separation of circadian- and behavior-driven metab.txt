Misalignment between internal circadian rhythmicity and externally
imposed behavioral schedules, such as occurs in shift workers, has
been implicated in elevated risk of metabolic disorders. To determine
underlying mechanisms, it is essential to assess whether and how
peripheral clocks are disturbed during shift work and to what extent
this is linked to the central suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) pacemaker
and/or misaligned behavioral time cues. Investigating rhythms in
circulating metabolites as biomarkers of peripheral clock distur-
bances may offer new insights. We evaluated the impact of
misaligned sleep/wake and feeding/fasting cycles on circulating
metabolites using a targeted metabolomics approach. Sequential
plasma samples obtained during a 24-h constant routine that
followed a 3-d simulated night-shift schedule, compared with a
simulated day-shift schedule, were analyzed for 132 circulating
metabolites. Nearly half of these metabolites showed a 24-h rhyth-
micity under constant routine following either or both simulated shift
schedules. However, while traditional markers of the circadian clock
in the SCN—melatonin, cortisol, and PER3 expression—maintained a
stable phase alignment after both schedules, only a few metabo-
lites did the same. Many showed reversed rhythms, lost their
rhythms, or showed rhythmicity only under constant routine fol-
lowing the night-shift schedule. Here, 95% of the metabolites with
a 24-h rhythmicity showed rhythms that were driven by behavior-
al time cues externally imposed during the preceding simulated
shift schedule rather than being driven by the central SCN circa-
dian clock. Characterization of these metabolite rhythms will pro-
vide insight into the underlying mechanisms linking shift work and
metabolic disorders.

ndogenous circadian rhythms exist in nearly all physiological
and behavioral processes, including metabolism. In normal
physiology, the central circadian clock, located in the hypothalamic
suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), synchronizes the timing of periph-
eral clocks in the liver, gut, pancreas, and adipose tissue via mul-
tiple neural and hormonal pathways (1). Desynchronization of this
circadian timing system from externally imposed behavioral
rhythms (light/dark exposure; sleep/wakefulness; rest/activity;
feeding/fasting)—such as occurs in shift workers—over time re-
sults in a number of metabolic disorders including obesity, met-
abolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes (2). To determine the
underlying mechanisms linking shift work to metabolic disorders,
it is essential to understand whether and how peripheral clocks are
disturbed during shift work and to what extent these peripheral
clocks are driven by the central SCN pacemaker versus misaligned
behavioral time cues. Investigating rhythms in circulating metab-
olites as biomarkers of peripheral clock disturbances may enable
this, thereby offering an important step forward.
Previous circadian and sleep metabolomics studies have shown
time-of-day variation in plasma metabolites. As expected under
fully entrained conditions with alignment of the central SCN
pacemaker and behavioral cycles, a large number of metabolites
are rhythmic (3, 4). However, under constant routine conditions in
which exogenous factors are removed or fixed, only 10–20% of
metabolites appear rhythmic (5–7). It remains unknown whether
the oscillations seen in metabolites that remain rhythmic under
constant routine conditions are driven by the central SCN pace-
maker or whether they are reflections of peripheral oscillators that
continue to cycle in the absence of externally imposed behavioral
time cues that were initially driving them. Distinguishing these
possibilities is critical for understanding how shift work may lead
to peripheral rhythm disturbances that may be involved in the
etiology of metabolic disorders.
The rhythmic production of the hormones melatonin and
cortisol is driven directly by SCN timing; these hormones are
therefore considered reliable markers of the phase of the central
SCN clock (8). Rhythms that reflect the SCN pacemaker have
Significance
Shift workers, whose schedules are misaligned relative to their
suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) circadian pacemaker, are at ele-
vated risk of metabolic disorders. In a study of simulated day-
versus night-shift work followed by a constant routine, we
separated plasma-circulating metabolites according to whether
their 24-h rhythms aligned with the central SCN pacemaker or
instead reflected externally imposed behavioral schedules. We
found that rhythms in many metabolites implicated in food
metabolism dissociated from the SCN pacemaker rhythm, with
the vast majority aligning with the preceding sleep/wake and
feeding/fasting cycles. Our metabolomics study yields insight
into the link between prolonged exposure to shift work and
the spectrum of associated metabolic disorders by providing a
window into peripheral oscillators and the biobehavioral fac-
tors that orchestrate them.

 also been observed in the expression of core clock genes, such as
Period3 (PER3), that can be measured in blood-borne cells (9).
Previous studies in both simulated (10, 11) and real-world (12,
13) shift work have shown that the rhythms of these circadian
markers are resistant to phase shifting, indicating that the en-
dogenous SCN rhythm is slow to adapt to shift work schedules.
As such, exposure to a night-shift schedule produces misalign-
ment between behavioral rhythms and the rhythm of the central
SCN pacemaker.
In a between-groups, in-laboratory study, we assigned healthy
volunteers (ages 22–34 y) to 3 d of either a simulated night-shift
schedule (seven subjects) or a simulated day-shift (i.e., control)
schedule (seven subjects). In each group, this was followed by a
24-h constant routine protocol, during which blood was drawn at 3-h
intervals to measure plasma metabolite profiles using a targeted
liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) metabolomics
approach (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). We thus characterized 24-h
rhythms in metabolites, free of exogenous factors, after the cen-
tral SCN clock and behaviorally induced rhythms were experi-
mentally misaligned (night-shift condition) or aligned (day-shift
condition). This allowed us to assess whether oscillations observed
in metabolites are driven by the central SCN pacemaker—or
whether they are the signature of shifted behavioral rhythms
during the preceding days of shift work.
Results
During the constant routine after 3 d of simulated shift work, the
dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and the 24-h rhythm of
plasma cortisol (traditional markers of the central SCN pace-
maker) as well as the 24-h rhythm in clock gene PER3 expression
all showed relatively little phase difference between the day-shift
and night-shift conditions (SI Appendix, Figs. S2–S4). A delay
of ∼2 h was observed after the night-shift condition, regardless
of which rhythm marker was used, which is congruent with a

 free-running rhythm (circadian period τ > 24 h) (14). This in-
dicates that the SCN pacemaker was resistant to phase shifting
by the behaviorally imposed schedule, as expected, and that
adaptation of the endogenous SCN timing system to the night-
shift schedule was limited. Thus, the night-shift condition suc-
cessfully produced misalignment between behavioral rhythms
(light/dark exposure; sleep/wakefulness; rest/activity; feeding/
fasting), which were shifted by 12 h under the simulated night-
shift condition, and the relatively unyielding rhythm of the
central SCN pacemaker.
The blood samples taken during the 24-h constant routine
were analyzed for 132 circulating metabolites from 5 metabolite
classes using targeted LC/MS metabolomics. For each of these
metabolites, the samples were analyzed with cosinor analysis to
assess the presence and timing of 24-h rhythmicity (SI Appendix,
Table S1). Nearly half of the metabolites analyzed (i.e., 65 of
132) showed significant 24-h rhythmicity during the constant
routine under either or both conditions. Of these, a group of 27
metabolites showed rhythmicity following both the simulated
day-shift and night-shift schedules. A group of 19 metabolites
lost their rhythmicity under constant routine following the night-
shift schedule. For another group of 19 metabolites, no signifi-
cant rhythmicity was observed following the day-shift schedule,
but rhythmicity emerged under constant routine following the
night-shift schedule. For each of the metabolites that showed a
significant 24-h rhythm, Fig. 1 shows the clock time at which the
rhythm peaked (acrophase).
Fig. 1, Bottom Left, shows the 27 metabolites with significant
24-h rhythmicity under both conditions. Only three of these
metabolites maintained approximately the same peak time fol-
lowing both the simulated day-shift and night-shift schedules (as
did the traditional circadian markers, DLMO and cortisol peak):
serotonin, taurine, and sarcosine (Fig. 2, Left). By contrast, un-
der constant routine following the simulated night-shift schedule,
24 metabolites significantly shifted—and in most cases essen-
tially reversed (i.e., shifted by 12 h)—their rhythms. These me-
tabolites comprised four amino acids (ornithine, arginine,
isoleucine, and proline), octadecanoylcarnitine (AC-C18:1), and
a collection of glycerophospholipids, lysophosphatidylcholines
(lysoPCs), and sphingolipids (for an example, see Fig. 2, Right).
Fig. 1, Top, shows the metabolites that exhibited significant
24-h rhythmicity following the day-shift condition, but lost
rhythmicity following the night-shift schedule. These metabolites
included half of the measured lysoPCs, and 7 of the 20 amino
acids, all of which peaked during the daytime hours. Fig. 1, Right,
on the other hand, shows the metabolites that did not exhibit
significant 24-h rhythmicity following the day-shift condition, but
exhibited rhythmicity following the night-shift condition. These
metabolites comprised half of the measured acylcarnitines, glu-
tamate, tryptophan, citrulline, and 11 phosphatidylcholines, all
but 1 peaking during the nighttime hours.
Fig. 2, Top, illustrates the contrast between one of the three
metabolites that maintained a stable peak time following both the
simulated day-shift and night-shift schedules, namely the amino
acid sarcosine (N-methylglycine, Left), and one of the 24 metab-
olites that reversed their rhythms under constant routine following
the simulated night-shift schedule, namely the sphingolipid SM
C20:2 (Right). As shown in Fig. 2 (Middle), when plotted against
circadian time—i.e., relative to DLMO (which itself remained
relatively stable between the two schedules)—the 24-h rhythm in
sarcosine aligned nearly perfectly between the day- and night-shift
schedules, indicating a strong influence of the central SCN
pacemaker; but this was not the case for SM C20:2. By contrast, as
shown in Fig. 2 (Bottom), when plotted against zeitgeber time—
i.e., relative to the scheduled timing of the light/dark, sleep/wake,
rest/activity, and feeding/fasting cycles in the preceding shift days—
the 24-h rhythm in SM C20:2 lined up nearly perfectly between the
day- and night-shift conditions. This was observed despite the fact
that these behavioral cycles were no longer present under the
constant routine conditions in which these metabolites were
measured, providing substantial evidence that the observed
rhythms in this metabolite (and others like it) were driven by
behavioral rhythms in the preceding shift days and were
subsequently retained.
The subdivision according to the observed rhythms following the
day- and night-shift schedules as captured in Fig. 1 was corrobo-
rated by principal component analysis, which yielded three distinct
clusters of metabolites (SI Appendix, Table S2). Cluster 1 rep-
resented the group of metabolites that showed 24-h rhythmicity
under constant routine following both the day- and night-shift
schedules, but reversed their rhythms following the night-shift
schedule (SI Appendix, Fig. S5, Top). Heat maps revealed that
this pattern was the primary response to the experiment in the
overall data set (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Cluster 1 was dominated
by glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. Cluster 2 repre-
sented the group of metabolites that showed significant 24-h
rhythmicity under constant routine only after the day-shift
schedule (SI Appendix, Fig. S5, Middle). This cluster was
dominated by lysophosphatidylcholines and a variety of amino
acids. Cluster 3 represented the group of metabolites that did not
show significant 24-h rhythmicity under constant routine after
the day-shift schedule, but was rhythmic after the night-shift
schedule (SI Appendix, Fig. S5, Bottom). Similar to the other
two clusters, cluster 3 was dominated by acylcarnitines, some
amino acids, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids.
The 65 metabolites that showed significant rhythmicity during
constant routine following the day-shift and/or night-shift schedules
were entered into pathway analyses. Under the day-shift condition,
nine pathways were significantly enriched (SI Appendix, Table S3),
including aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism, argi-
nine–proline metabolism, and D-glutamine–glutamate metabolism—
as well as alanine–asparate–glutamate metabolism, cyanoamino
acid metabolism, D-arginine and D-ornithine metabolism, glutathi-
one metabolism, and glycine–serine–threonine metabolism, which
were not significantly enriched under the night-shift condition.
Under the night-shift condition, five pathways were significantly
enriched (SI Appendix, Table S4), including aminoacyl-tRNA bio-
synthesis, nitrogen metabolism, arginine–proline metabolism,
and D-arginine–ornithine metabolism—as well as valine–leucine–
isoleucine biosynthesis, which was not significantly enriched under
the day-shift condition. As such, the observed rhythms in circulating
metabolites and the metabolic pathways affected appear to reflect
metabolic processes in the liver, pancreas, and digestive tract.
Discussion
Night-shift workers are at elevated risk of a wide range of
chronic medical conditions, including gastrointestinal disorders
and debilitating metabolic disorders such as metabolic syndrome
and type 2 diabetes mellitus (2, 15). It has been hypothesized
that misalignment between internal circadian rhythmicity and
externally imposed behavioral schedules associated with night-
time wakefulness underlies this elevated risk (15, 16). However, a
reliable tool to separate circadian- and behavior-driven rhythms
in metabolism to test this hypothesis has been lacking.
In the current laboratory-controlled, simulated shift work
study, we investigated the metabolic consequences of misaligned
sleep/wake and feeding/fasting cycles using a targeted metab-
olomics approach. We found that, whereas traditional markers
of the circadian clock in the SCN (melatonin, cortisol, PER3
expression) remained relatively stable after 3 d of simulated shift
work, many of the plasma metabolites (62 of 132) showed pro-
found changes in the timing of their rhythms following simulated
night work (Fig. 1; SI Appendix, Table S1). In the majority of
cases, these changes involved nearly complete reversal of the 24-h
rhythmicity in the metabolites (SI Appendix, Figs. S5 and S6)—
typically peaking during the daytime after the day-shift condition

 and during the nighttime after the night-shift condition (e.g., Fig.
2, Right). In other instances, 24-h rhythms were seen only after
the day-shift condition, peaking during the daytime, or only after
the night-shift condition, peaking during the nighttime (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S5). Although with 14 subjects our sample was rel-
atively small, these effects were robust and highly statistically
significant. Importantly, the altered rhythms persisted under
constant routine conditions in the absence of any externally
imposed rhythms. This provides strong evidence that most of the
metabolite rhythms observed were driven by behavioral time
cues—from the light/dark exposure, sleep/wakefulness, rest/ac-
tivity, and/or feeding/fasting cycles—during the preceding simu-
lated shift schedules. Exogenous, behavioral time cues associated
with externally imposed schedules thus have the capacity to drive
endogenous rhythmicity in metabolism, likely by impacting on
peripheral oscillators (17, 18) and dissociating them from the
rhythm of the central SCN pacemaker.
The mechanisms linking shift work with an increased risk of
type 2 diabetes are not well understood. Although metabolic
profiling (metabolomics) has been used to investigate pre-
diabetic/obese and type 2 diabetic phenotypes (19–21), this has
been limited to single-time-point samples. To assess the in-
teraction between circadian timing and metabolic physiology, we
recently compared 24-h metabolite rhythms in overweight/obese
individuals and in individuals with type 2 diabetes to age- and
weight-matched controls (4). Several metabolites, including
proline, sarcosine, and lysoPC a C18:1 and C18:2, exhibited ro-
bust daily rhythms in the majority of participants in all study
groups and showed a progressive change in concentration from
lean to overweight/obese to type 2 diabetes groups. Isoleucine
and valine rhythms were lost in patients with type 2 diabetes
compared with controls. These metabolites may play a role or act
as biomarkers in the progression from a healthy weight to obesity
with type 2 diabetes. In the current study, rhythms in proline,
lysoPC a C18:1 and C18:2, leucine, and isoleucine were altered
by externally imposed behavioral time cues (Fig. 1), and pathway
analysis implicated proline metabolism and biosynthesis of
branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine) as im-
pacted by simulated night-shift work (SI Appendix, Table S4).
Whether these metabolite rhythms and pathways reflecting dis-
rupted circadian rhythms in peripheral metabolism due to sim-
ulated night-shift work link to the metabolic phenotype of type 2
diabetes remains to be studied.
In addition to type 2 diabetes, shift work has been linked to
a host of other chronic medical conditions, including renal dys-
function (22, 23) and various types of cancer (24–27). There is

 evidence that the kidneys have their own circadian oscillators
(28), and it is possible that disruption of these peripheral oscil-
lators leads to renal disease (29). Consistent with this possibility,
we found that tryptophan and kynurenine, markers of renal
function (30), were altered by prior exposure to simulated
night-shift work. Peripheral clocks are also critically involved
in the coordination of cellular processes such as cell cycles,
DNA repair, and apoptosis (31). Animal models with exter-
nally disturbed circadian rhythms show dysregulation of these
processes, promoting tumorigenesis and tumor growth (32–
34). Our pathway analyses revealed that some of the major
components of amino acid metabolism—including cyanoamino
acid, glycine, serine, threonine, alanine, and glutathione
pathways—were enriched under the day-shift condition but
not under the night-shift condition (SI Appendix, Tables S3
and S4). These pathways have the capacity to influence
cancer-cell gene-expression patterns, cell proliferation, and
tumor microenvironments (35), and glutathione in particular
plays a role in protection against oxidative stress, increased
mitochondrial respiration, and protection from cell death (36).
Our targeted metabolomics approach was not specifically fo-
cused on such effects, but the results suggest that altered
metabolite rhythms after exposure to night-shift work could
be involved in the development of a wide range of chronic
diseases (37).
Of the 65 metabolites that showed 24-h rhythmicity under
constant routine following either or both simulated shift sched-
ules, only 3 maintained a rhythm after both schedules in which a
stable phase alignment was kept relative to traditional markers
of the central SCN clock (melatonin, cortisol, PER3 expression;
SI Appendix, Figs. S2–S4). These metabolites—taurine, seroto-
nin, and sarcosine (N-methylglycine; Fig. 2, Left)—thus appear
to be resistant to externally imposed behavioral rhythms. Their
temporal profiles may be controlled by the SCN clock (38), or
they may be generally slower to adapt to shifted temporal cues.
The observed 24-h rhythms in the other 62 metabolites, most of
which are bioactive lipids, amino acids, acylcarnitines, and other
compounds implicated in metabolic processes and energy me-
tabolism, provide a window on peripheral clock function in the
liver, pancreas, and digestive tract. Although our study involved
acute exposure to simulated night-shift work in healthy non–
shift-working volunteers inside the laboratory, and the results
therefore do not readily generalize to real-world shift-work
settings, our data nonetheless provide clues about which
metabolic pathways to target for further research. Such re-
search could, on the one hand, aim to identify early stage
biomarkers of the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders
associated with shift work and, on the other hand, aim to
elucidate underlying mechanisms and enable the develop-
ment of new therapeutic interventions to promote long-term
shift worker health.
The 24-h duration of our constant routine protocol was rela-
tively short, which is a limitation of the study. Even so, our re-
sults were robust to any transient effects from physiological
adjustment to the constant routine procedures that may have
occurred (SI Appendix, Materials and Methods). Also, the tar-
geted metabolomics approach that we used (3, 4) did not cover
the entire metabolome. As such, we do not know whether other
classes of metabolites (e.g., polar metabolites) would show a
similar predominance of synchronization to behavioral time cues
rather than the central SCN pacemaker. While our targeted
approach is restrictive in that regard, it is quantitative and reli-
able (39) and, compared with whole-metabolome analyses, can
be more readily confirmed and validated in other laboratories.
Through our targeted metabolomics approach, we were thus
able to separate circadian- and behavior-driven rhythms in me-
tabolism. The behavior-driven rhythms that we observed may
have been influenced by the experimentally imposed time cues in
light/dark exposure, sleep/wakefulness, rest/activity, and/or feed-
ing/fasting; our experimental paradigm did not allow us to disen-
tangle these external factors. However, night-shift workers
typically experience changes in these behavioral time cues in
tandem, as their work schedules force them to shift their wake-
fulness—and thereby also their activity and feeding patterns and
exposure to light—into the night.
Time-restricted feeding has been proposed as a potential strat-
egy to restore normal peripheral clock rhythmicity in metabolic
pathways disturbed by circadian misalignment (40). In mouse
models, feeding restriction during the inactive part of the day re-
sults in ∼12-h phase shifting in core clock genes in peripheral tis-
sues such as the liver (17, 41) within a time span of just 2 d (42).
Time-restricted feeding patterns also affect the mouse metabolome
(43), but the phase shifting in peripheral oscillators appears to be
independent of clock gene expression in the central SCN pace-
maker (17, 42). Initial laboratory studies in humans suggest that
time-restricted feeding may help to address abnormalities in glu-
cose metabolism in night-shift workers (44). Our current finding of
simulated night-shift work inducing changes in the timing of me-
tabolite rhythms, indicative of disturbed peripheral clock function
in the liver, pancreas, and digestive tract, provides a mechanistic
foundation for this type of intervention and a quantitative tool to
determine its effectiveness.

S1) was conducted under controlled conditions (constant ambient temper-
ature of 21 ± 1 °C, constant light level of less than 50 lx during scheduled
wakefulness) in the Sleep and Performance Research Center at Washington
State University Spokane. The study consisted of a baseline day and night
followed by assignment to either a 3-d simulated day-shift schedule (sleep
opportunity: 22:00–06:00) or, after a transition nap (sleep opportunity:
14:00–18:00), to a 3-d simulated night-shift schedule (sleep opportunity:
10:00–18:00). During the simulated shift days, breakfast, lunch, and dinner
were provided at 1.5, 7, and 13.5 h of scheduled wakefulness, respectively.
The 3-d simulated shift schedule was followed by a 24-h constant routine
protocol, which involved controlled environmental conditions with fixed
semirecumbent posture, hourly identical snacks, and sustained wakefulness
to investigate rhythms free of exogenous factors (45). The study concluded
with a recovery day.
During the 24-h constant routine, blood samples were taken through an
i.v. catheter at intervals of 1–3 h (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). The samples were
used for targeted LC/MS metabolomics and cortisol and PER3 assays. Addi-
tional i.v. blood samples were taken hourly during the baseline day (18:30–
21:30) and during the constant routine (18:30–01:30) for melatonin assays (SI
Appendix, Fig. S1).
Analyses. See SI Appendix, Materials and Methods for details of the targeted
LC/MS metabolomics analysis; melatonin, cortisol, and PER3 assays; and
statistical analyses.
