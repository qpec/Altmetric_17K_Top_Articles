SUMMARY
Aging and lipotoxicity are two major risk factors for
gout that are linked by the activation of the NLRP3
inflammasome. Neutrophil-mediated production of
interleukin-1b (IL-1b) drives gouty flares that cause
joint destruction, intense pain, and fever. However,
metabolites that impact neutrophil inflammasome
remain unknown. Here, we identified that ketogenic
diet (KD) increases b-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and
alleviates urate crystal-induced gout without impair-
ing immune defense against bacterial infection. BHB
inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome in S100A9 fibril-
primed and urate crystal-activated macrophages,
which serve to recruit inflammatory neutrophils in
joints. Consistent with reduced gouty flares in rats
fed a ketogenic diet, BHB blocked IL-1b in neutro-
phils in a NLRP3-dependent manner in mice and
humans irrespective of age. Mechanistically, BHB
inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome in neutrophils
by reducing priming and assembly steps. Collec-
tively, our studies show that BHB, a known alternate
metabolic fuel, is also an anti-inflammatory molecule
that may serve as a treatment for gout.
INTRODUCTION
Gout is a debilitating chronic inflammatory arthritis that afflicts
4% of adults in the United States and is caused by the deposition
of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in the joints (Garrod, 1876;
Seegmiller and Howell, 1962). It is widely known that aging and
diet-induced lipotoxicity predispose for the development of
gout, as the prevalence of gout in elderly persons above the
age of 60 years is �10% (Joosten et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013;
Roddy and Choi, 2014). MSU crystal-induced gouty flares are
characterized by interleukin-1b (IL-1b)-driven acute inflamma-
tion, fever, and intense pain caused by monocyte-mediated
neutrophil accumulation and activation in joints (Duff et al.,
1983). Mechanistically, the inflammatory gouty flares caused
by MSU crystals are mediated via the activation of the NLRP3 in-
flammasome in myeloid cells that causes the release of bioactive
IL-1b and IL-18 (Martinon et al., 2006).
The NLRP3 inflammasome is a carefully regulated inflamma-
tory complex that responds to both endogenous cellular
abnormalities and microbial components. Activation of the
complex requires two signals: (1) a priming signal (signal 1)
that licenses nuclear factor kB (NF-kB)-dependent expression
of inflammasome complex proteins and (2) a secondary signal
(signal 2) that promotes assembly of the complex leading
to caspase-1 activation. MSU crystals provide signal 2 of
NLRP3 activation, and NLRP3-deficient mice are protected
from MSU-induced inflammation (Martinon et al., 2006).
Therefore, gout patients face a vicious feed-forward loop
in which the chronic deposition and presence of MSU crystals
enables constant reactivation of acute inflammatory res-
ponses, known as gouty flares, which are associated with
intense pain and fever due to high systemic IL-1b levels
(Dalbeth et al., 2016; Duff et al., 1983).
The long-term prophylactic treatment of gout hinges on
reducing hyperuricemia. Intriguingly, a major side effect of
all current urate-lowering drugs such as xanthine oxidase
inhibitors (allopurinol and febuxostat), recombinant uricase
(pegloticase), and uricosurics (probenecid and benzbromar-
one) is the induction of gouty flares (Dalbeth et al., 2016).
Despite progress in the field, the relief from inflammation dur-
ing acute gouty flares currently relies on non-NLRP3-specific
therapeutic approaches such as the use of adrenocorticotro-
pic hormone (ACTH), corticosteroids, or nonsteroidal anti-in-
flammatory drugs (NSAIDS) (Dalbeth et al., 2016 and refer-
ences therin). Thus, elucidating the endogenous metabolites
that regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation and resolution
of inflammation remain a priority for effective management of
gout.
Interestingly, metabolic interventions such as caloric restric-
tion (CR) or moderate carbohydrate restriction reduces gout
(Dessein et al., 2000). Of note, a classical feature of adaptive

 starvation response during negative energy balance is the in-
duction of fatty acid oxidation and production of ketone bodies
b-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate (AcAc) that serve
as major substrates for ATP production to support the function
of heart and brain (Cahill, 2006). Intriguingly, CR and BHB reduce
inflammation and extend lifespan in animals (Edwards et al.,
2014; Mitchell et al., 2016), suggesting immune-metabolic inter-
actions driven by BHB may serve as pseudostarvation signals or
CR mimetic that could be harnessed against acute inflammatory
diseases such as gouty flares.
We made the surprising discovery that myeloid cells also ex-
press ketogenic and ketolytic machinery and that BHB blocks
the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages (Youm et al., 2015).
This suggests that ketones may function as regulatory metabo-
lites, serving as endogenous regulators of inflammation (Gold-
berg and Dixit, 2015). Given that neutrophils are key instigators
of inflammation-induced gouty flares, we hypothesized that
upregulation of BHB-mediated signals in neutrophils serve as a
key immunometabolic checkpoint against gout. Here, we report
that BHB prevents NLRP3 inflammasome activation in both
mouse and human neutrophils irrespective of the aging process.
We found that BHB inhibits the signals that control the priming
and assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome in primary neutro-
phils and protects against gout.
RESULTS
Elevated BHB Protects against Acute Gout
MSU crystals are the hallmark characteristic of gout (McCarty
and Hollander, 1961); the proposed mechanism of a gouty flare
is that activation of macrophages by urate crystals recruits neu-
trophils in an inflammasome-dependent manner, and the accu-
mulation and activation of neutrophils cause substantial pain
and swelling (Duff et al., 1983; Martinon et al., 2006). The priming
of inflammasome is also a critical step in the process of gouty
flare. Interestingly, cytoplasmic S100A8/9 protein heterodimers
are highly expressed in neutrophils (Edgeworth et al., 1991)
and increase in synovial fluid (Holzinger et al., 2014) and plasma
(Ryckman et al., 2003) during a gout flare. Furthermore, S100A8
can activate TLR4 (Vogl et al., 2007), and MSU stimulates the
secretion of S100A8/9 from neutrophils (Ryckman et al., 2004).
We found that BHB prevented caspase-1 activation and IL-1b
secretion in MSU-treated S100A9-primed bone-marrow-derived
macrophages (BMDMs) (Figures 1A and 1B). While S100A9 fi-
brils provided a priming signal in BMDMs (Figure S1E), they do
not function as a danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)
to provide signal 2 for inflammasome activation in lipopoly-
saccharide (LPS)-primed BMDM (Figure S1F). Thus, S100A8/9
proteins may represent one of the endogenous sources of
priming signal for NLRP3 inflammasome in vivo.
BHB serves as an alternate metabolic fuel during starvation
state or in absence of insulin when glucose cannot be utilized.
Ketogenic diets (KDs) that are rich in fat and low in carbohy-
drates are routinely employed to induce BHB or nutritional
ketosis, because sustained elevation of BHB through infusion
of sodium salts of BHB is contraindicated due to adverse effects
on blood acid-base balance. Thus, KD has been safely em-
ployed to treat drug-resistant epilepsy (Cahill, 2006). Although
IL-1R antagonists have shown benefit in small clinical trials (So
et al., 2007, 2010), the high cost of these biologicals and their po-
tential detrimental impact on host defense have limited their use
in treatment of gouty flares. Therefore, we next developed a
model of gouty arthritis and investigated the induction of nutri-
tional ketosis by feeding KD as a potential therapy against
gout. Humans, but not rodents, are susceptible to gout due to
loss of the uricase enzyme, which normally functions to prevent
high concentrations of uric acid. Therefore, we developed an
in vivo gout model in outbred Sprague-Dawley rats by intra-artic-
ular injection of MSU crystals in the knee. One week of high-fat,
low-carbohydrate KD feeding induced endogenous BHB pro-
duction (Figure 1C). Rats fed KD were protected from the
MSU-induced elevated serum IL-1b (Figure 1D) and knee
swelling observed in the chow-fed rats (Figures 1E and 1F). Pa-
thology analysis of H&E-stained sections of the joints showed
that MSU-injected rats displayed combined lesions of intra-artic-
ular exudate and synovial soft tissue inflammation (Figure 1G).
Intra-articular exudate was characterized by masses of fibrin,
amorphous granular foreign material, and clusters of macro-
phages (Figure 1H). The extent of both intra-articular exudate
and synovial inflammation was less severe in KD-fed animals
than in those on chow diet. Overall, KD reduced the severity of
the inflammatory reactions in MSU-injected knees. Foci of frank
necrosis were present in animals on the control diet, but not in
those on the ketone-rich diet (Figure 1H). Notably, KD results
in elevation of blood ketone bodies BHB as well as AcAc. Our
data suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of ketones
are limited to BHB, as neither AcAc nor the microbiota-derived
short chain fatty acid butyrate prevented IL-1b secretion in in-
flammasome-activated BMDM (Figure 1I). Importantly, reduced
inflammatory responses during KD did not increase disease
severity in mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus (Figures
1J and S1G–S1I) and surprisingly reduced bacterial burdens in
the lungs of infected mice (Figure 1K). Taken together, our data
show that elevated BHB levels protect against acute gouty flare
without compromising the host-defense functions of the immune
system.

 BHB Acts on Neutrophils to Block IL-1b Secretion
throughout the Lifespan
Gout flares are mediated by both macrophage and neutrophil
activation. Because BHB inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activa-
tion in macrophages (Youm et al., 2015) and in an in vitro model
of gout (Figure 1B), we next tested whether BHB regulates IL-1b
secretion from neutrophils. Indeed, BHB dose-dependently
inhibited IL-1b secretion in isolated murine neutrophils (Figures
2A and S2). Aging is a major risk factor for gout, and if not prop-
erly managed, gouty flares increase in frequency and intensity in
the elderly. Importantly, BHB potently inhibited the NLRP3 in-
flammasome-induced IL-1b secretion in neutrophils of young
and elderly humans (Figure 2B), but not secretion of S100A8 pro-
tein implicated in the propagation of gouty flares (Figure 2C).
BHB inhibited IL-1b secretion in response to classical NLRP3
inflammasome activation (Figure 2D) as well as the age-related
lipotoxic DAMP ceramide (Figure 2E) in isolated adult and old
murine neutrophils. Ketogenesis is typically induced during
hypoglycemia or lack of glucose availability, which may alter
neutrophil function. Therefore, we next determined whether neu-
trophils in humans exposed to hypoglycemia in vivo respond to
BHB (Figure 2F). Indeed, IL-1b secretion is still sensitive to BHB-
mediated inhibition regardless of glucose availability in vivo (Fig-
ure 2G). These experiments reveal a regulatory role for BHB in
neutrophil inflammasome activation regardless of the host’s age.
BHB Reduces Urate-Crystal-Induced Inflammation
during Aging
Neutrophils are reported to accumulate several defects during
aging, including impaired Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling
(Qian et al., 2014) and NETosis (Hazeldine et al., 2014). Neutro-
phils are also associated with immunopathology during infection
in aged hosts (Bou Ghanem et al., 2015; Menter et al., 2014).
Bone marrow neutrophils from aged mice exhibited no remark-
able differences in abundance or expression of NLRP3 inflam-
masome proteins compared to young controls (Figure S2). To
test neutrophil-intrinsic inflammasome activation defects during
aging, isolated neutrophils from adult and old mice were stimu-
lated with LPS+ATP. IL-1b, but not tumor necrosis factor a
(TNF-a) secretion, was NLRP3- and ASC-dependent and no
age-related differences were observed (Figures 3A and 3B).

 in vitro (Figures 2B, 2D, and 2E), we next sought to determine
whether BHB could reduce neutrophillic inflammation in vivo
during aging. To induce endogenous ketogenesis, old mice
were fed KD for 1 week. During this time, no alterations to
body weight (Figure 3C) were observed and blood BHB levels
increased rapidly (Figure 3D). KD did not change peritoneal
neutrophil infiltration (Figure S3) but prevented upregulation of
Nlrp3 and Il1b gene expression, but not the general inflammatory
marker Tnfa in old mice (Figures 3E–3G) after MSU-induced
peritonitis. This suggests that BHB levels can be elevated during
aging to reduce acute urate-crystal-induced inflammatory
responses.
b-Hydroxybutyrate Inhibits NLRP3 Inflammasome
Priming and Assembly
Neutrophils contain both inflammasome-dependent and inflam-
masome-independent IL-1b cleavage processes (Cassel et al.,
2014; Joosten et al., 2009; Karmakar et al., 2015; Mankan
et al., 2012). In our experimental conditions, neutrophil IL-1b
secretion, in response to several DAMPs, including extracellular
ATP, the crystalline silica, or lipotoxic ceramide, was entirely
caspase-1/11-dependent (Figure 4A). In cell-free assays, BHB
had no effect on enzyme activity of neutrophil serine proteases
elastase (Figure 4B) or cathepsin G (Figure 4C), both of which
have been implicated in IL-1b cleavage (Cassel et al., 2014;
Guma et al., 2009). We next investigated the mechanism by
which BHB inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation in neutro-
phils. GPR109a can bind BHB on the cell surface to inhibit
inflammation; however, we found that niacin, a high-affinity
ligand for GPR109a, failed to impact neutrophil IL-1b cleavage,
suggesting that in vitro GPR109a signaling is dispensable for
neutrophil inflammasome activation (Figure 4D). Ketogenesis
occurs during energy restriction, a physiological state in which
autophagy is induced. However, BHB’s inhibition of IL-1b
secretion does not rely on autophagy, because treatment of
neutrophils with the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA did not prevent
BHB-mediated inhibition of IL-1b secretion (Figure 4E). Similarly,
treating cells with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle entry inhibi-
tor (aminooxy)acetic acid hemihydrochloride (AOA) did not pre-
vent BHB’s inhibition of IL-1b secretion, suggesting oxidation
of BHB is not required for its effect (Figure 4E). Interestingly,
the non-oxidizable chiral enantiomer S-BHB, which cannot enter
the TCA cycle, also inhibited IL-1b secretion from neutrophils
(Figure 4F), suggesting that in the presence of glucose in vitro,
myeloid cells energetically spare BHB to block inflammasome
activation.
Unaltered caspase-11 activation or gasdermin D expression in
the presence of BHB (Figure S4A) suggested that BHB also does
not impact neutrophil pyroptosis (He et al., 2015; Kayagaki et al.,
2015; Shi et al., 2015) and BHB did not alter cell viability (Fig-
ure S4B). BHB treatment led to increased histone H3 acetylation
(Figure 4G), probably due to its reported histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitor activity (Shimazu et al., 2013). Interestingly,
BHB inhibited phosphorylation of NF-kB (Figure 4H), a neces-
sary signaling event for inflammasome activation, confirming
previous findings (Fu et al., 2014). Finally, BHB was tested in a
mouse model of the severe human disease familial cold autoin-
flammatory syndrome (FCAS), which contains an L351P nucleo-
tide substitution in Nlrp3 that facilities constitutive inflamma-
some assembly (Brydges et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2006). IL-1b
secretion from neutrophils in this FCAS model was dose-depen-
dently inhibited by treatment with BHB-conjugated nanolipogels
(Figure 4I). These data suggest that the inhibitory effect of BHB
upon NLRP3 inflammasome activation is two-pronged: (1) it
prevents TLR4-mediated priming, and (2) it blocks the physical
assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex.
DISCUSSION
Gout is a chronic disease characterized by recurrent painful
gouty flares. The incidence of gout has steadily increased, and
individuals over age 65 account for the majority of gout-related
hospitalizations (Lim et al., 2016). Although a primary treatment
strategy for gout is to lower uric acid levels, many of these
medications induce gouty flares, presumably due to disruption
of tophi, which results in poor adherence by patients. We found
that elevated blood BHB levels protected outbred rats from joint
swelling and systemic inflammation after intra-articular injection
of MSU crystals. Reduced joint swelling was due to a qualitative
reduction in the inflammatory response, as pathology analysis
revealed reduced tissue damage despite similar neutrophil and
macrophage infiltration into the joints.
In vitro, BHB also inhibits neutrophil IL-1b secretion from adult
and elderly individuals. Notably, elevated BHB levels during KD
did not increase disease severity during S. aureus infection in
mice and even reduced bacterial burdens in the lungs of infected
mice, suggesting high translational potential of BHB against
gouty flares. It was recently reported that glucose metabolism
promotes mortality during bacterial infection and LPS sepsis
(Wang et al., 2016), which may explain the beneficial effects of
KD in S. aureus-infected mice, as BHB reduces glucose avail-
ability. Notably, other macronutrients in KD can induce hormonal
alterations and plasma lipid profile changes in patients. More-
over, at the cellular level, limited glucose availability during KD
can induce autophagy, which inhibits the inflammasome. Thus,
additional studies are required to rule out the exact contribution
of each of these mechanisms in mediating anti-inflammasome
effects of KD in vivo in models of gout. Regardless, our findings
that BHB can target neutrophil inflammasome have important
clinical implications, as an estimated 8 million Americans have
gout (Zhu et al., 2011) and the cumulative nature of the disease
causes the risk and frequency of gouty flares to increase during
aging.
S100A8/9 proteins are also reported to increase during age-
related inflammatory diseases, including obesity (Nagareddy
et al., 2014), cardiovascular disease (Ma et al., 2012), and Alz-
heimer’s disease (Wang et al., 2014), and in the aged prostate
(Yanamandra et al., 2009). This implies that these proteins may
provide an endogenous, local signal 1 for NLRP3 inflammasome
activation and may be universal biomarkers of inflammation
(Vogl et al., 2007). During a gouty flare, neutrophils are recruited
to inflamed joints by resident macrophages and secrete a variety
of proinflammatory molecules, including S100A8/9 and IL-1b
(Ryckman et al., 2004). BHB inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome
activation in S100A9-primed macrophages (Figure 1B). Our
data suggest that BHB can break this feed-forward cycle to

secretion from caspase-1/11 knockout mice, cell-free assays
revealed no effect on enzymatic activity of serine proteases
neutrophil elastase or cathepsin G. These data highlight the
targeted effects of BHB upon the NLRP3 inflammasome,
making it an ideal candidate for preventing NLRP3-driven
inflammation.
Together with our prior findings that BHB inhibits NLRP3 in-
flammasome activation in macrophages (Youm et al., 2015)
and our current data that BHB also regulates neutrophil inflam-
masome activation, we propose that strategies to increase
BHB levels are likely to be therapeutically beneficial in gout pa-
tients. Furthermore, the NLRP3-targeted effects of BHB make
it ideal for reducing or preventing many age-related inflammatory
disease that have been shown to be driven by chronic NLRP3
inflammasome activation (Youm et al., 2013). Adherence to a
high-fat low-carbohydrate KD is difficult and can promote dysli-
pidemia in gout patients. However, ketone esters have been
delivered orally to humans, which increased circulating BHB
levels and enhanced physical performance in athletes (Clarke
et al., 2012; Cox et al., 2016), and should be explored for
inducing mild ketosis to prevent inflammation in individuals
with gout.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
All animals were housed under specific-pathogen-free conditions under a
12-hr light/dark cycle. All mice used were on the C57BL/6 genetic background.
See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details of mouse and rat
strains. KD (Research Diets D12369B) was initiated 1 week prior to experi-
mental manipulation. Blood BHB concentrations were measured with
Precision Xtra b-ketone strips. All animal experiments were performed in
compliance with the Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
Human Subjects
Healthy adult (18–45 years) and old (>65 years) males and females with no
current steroid use were recruited. Individuals were not fasting at time of pe-
ripheral blood collection, except for hypoglycemic studies. Insulin was used
to induce hypoglycemia, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for
detailed procedure. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects and
all studies were approved by the Institutional Review Committee of Yale
University.
Cell Isolation and Activation
Neutrophils were isolated from bone marrow (mice) or peripheral blood (hu-
mans) by negative magnetic selection (Stem Cell Technology; Figure S2).

Figure 5. Hypothetical Model for the Dual Role of BHB as a Regulatory Metabolite
(A) The metabolic role of BHB as an alternative energy source during limited energy availability, coordinated with the anti-inflammatory role of BHB on the NLRP3
inflammasome.
(B) BHB inhibits both the priming signal and the secondary assembling signal in neutrophils.
(C) Inhibition of IL-1b secretion by BHB does not involve inhibition of serine protease activity, autophagy, oxidation in the TCA cycle, or the surface receptor
GPR109a, although additional experiments will be needed to further clarify the mechanism.

 BMDM were generated and all cells were stimulated as previously described
(Youm et al., 2015), see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for detailed
treatment conditions.
In Vitro Activation Measurements
All biochemical analysis methods are described in detail in Supplemental
Experimental Procedures. Cytokine secretion was measured by Multiplex (Fig-
ures 3A and 3B; IL-1b and TNF-a from Life Technologies) or ELISA (human IL-
1b from eBioscience 88-7261-22; S100A8 from Thermo EHS100A8) according
to manufacturers’ protocols. Elastase (ab118971) and cathepsin G (ab204693)
enzymatic activity was assessed using kits (Abcam) according to manufac-
turer’s instructions.
Peritonitis Model
Peritonitis was induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of MSU crystals (Inviv-
ogen). Mice were injected with 2.5 mg MSU in PBS. 4 hr later, total peritoneal
cells were collected by lavage. Cells were counted using a hemacytometer,
and phenotype and gene expression were analyzed by flow cytometry and
RT-PCR, respectively.
Staphylococcus aureus Infection
Mice were infected intranasally with 108 colony-forming units (CFUs)
or 106 CFUs of S. aureus (strain 14458). Bacterial burdens were deter-
mined by plating serial dilutions 24 hr post-infection. Bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid (BALF) was collected by washing lungs three times with 1 mL ster-
ile PBS.
Gout Model
Gout was induced in rats by intra-articular injection of 1.25 mg MSU
in the knee. Knee thickness was measured with digital calipers. IL-1b
was measured in serum by ELISA (eBioscience BMS630). Knees were
fixed and decalcified in Bouins solution (Sigma). Tissue sectioning and
H&E staining were performed by the Yale Mouse Research Pathology and
Histology Core. For pathology analysis, all sections were taken from the
mid-sagittal region of the femoro-tibial joint, encompassing cruciate liga-
ments and menisci. Images are oriented with the patellar ligament on the
right. In high-power images, all images were taken from the anterior synovial
tissue.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (Graph-
Pad) as indicated in the text and figure legends. p < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant for all tests. All experiments were performed at least
twice. All graphs shown are combined from all replicates of each experiment,
and each data point represents an individual test subject. All data are ex-
pressed as mean ± SEM unless otherwise specified. For all statistical differ-
ences, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001. Western blot
experiments were repeated at least three times, each time pooling cells from
n = 3–5 mice.
