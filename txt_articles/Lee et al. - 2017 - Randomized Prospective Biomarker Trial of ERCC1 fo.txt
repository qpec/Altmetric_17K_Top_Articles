Purpose
Retrospective studies indicate that expression of excision repair cross complementing group 1
(ERCC1) protein is associated with platinum resistance and survival in non–small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). We conducted the first randomized trial, to our knowledge, to evaluate ERCC1 prospectively
and to assess the superiority of nonplatinum therapy over platinum doublet therapy for ERCC1-positive
NSCLC as well as noninferiority for ERCC1-negative NSCLC.
Patients and Methods
This trial had a marker-by-treatment interaction phase III design, with ERCC1 (8F1 antibody) status as
a randomization stratification factor. Chemona¨
ıve patients with NSCLC (stage IIIB and IV) were
eligible. Patients with squamous histology were randomly assigned to cisplatin and gemcitabine or
paclitaxel and gemcitabine; nonsquamous patients received cisplatin and pemetrexed or paclitaxel
and pemetrexed. Primary end point was overall survival (OS). We also evaluated an antibody specific
for XPF (clone 3F2). The target hazard ratio (HR) for patients with ERCC1-positive NSCLC
was # 0.78.
Results
Of patients, 648 were recruited (177 squamous, 471 nonsquamous). ERCC1-positive rates were 54.5%
and 76.7% in nonsquamous and squamous patients, respectively, and the corresponding XPF-positive
rates were 70.5% and 68.5%. Accrual stopped early in 2012 for squamous patients because OS for
nonplatinum therapy was inferior to platinum therapy (medianOS, 7.6months [paclitaxel andgemcitabine]v
10.7 months [cisplatin and gemcitabine]; HR, 1.46; P = .02). Accrual for nonsquamous patients
halted in 2013. Median OS was 8.0 (paclitaxel and pemetrexed) versus 9.6 (cisplatin and
pemetrexed) months for ERCC1-positive patients (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.44), and 10.3
(paclitaxel and pemetrexed) versus 11.6 (cisplatin and pemetrexed) months for ERCC1-negative
patients (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.33; interaction P = .64). OS HR was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.83 to
1.44) for XPF-positive patients, and 1.39 (95% CI, 0.90 to 2.15) for XPF-negative patients (in-
teraction P = .35). Neither ERCC1 nor XPF were prognostic: among nonsquamous patients, OS
HRs for positive versus negative were ERCC1, 1.11 (P = .32), and XPF, 1.08 (P = .55).
Conclusion
Superior outcomes were observed for patients with squamous histology who received platinum
therapy compared with nonplatinum chemotherapy; however, selecting chemotherapy by using
commercially available ERCC1 or XPF antibodies did not confer any extra survival benefit.

INTRODUCTION
Little progress has been made in managing wild-
type non–small-cell lung (NSCLC) cancer in the
last decade compared with advances that have
been made in treating the small subpopulations of
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–positive
and anaplastic lymphoma kinase–positive tumors
with tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Most pa-
tients with advanced NSCLC are treated with a
platinum doublet. An effective predictive bio-
marker is required to direct treatment to improve
outcomes.

 One of the most promising biomarkers is excision repair cross
complementing group 1 (ERCC1) protein, which is involved in the
repair of cytotoxic platinum DNA adducts.1-4 These adducts es-
tablish covalent cross-linking within and between DNA strands,
which inhibits DNA replication and leads to cell death. ERCC1
binds to XPF protein, forming a heterodimer complex that cleaves
DNA structures near the platinum adduct and allows for removal
of the cytotoxic DNA lesion.
ERCC1 has been examined as a prognostic or predictive marker
in several cancers that are treated with platinum chemotherapy. In-
creased ERCC1 expression is thought to be associated with platinum
resistance in retrospective NSCLC studies.5 In a meta-analysis of these
studies of patients with advanced NSCLC who were treated with
platinum therapy, mortality was higher in ERCC1-positive patients
than in those with low expression (overall survival [OS] hazard ratio
[HR], 1.48).6 Recent studies similarly conclude that ERCC1 is
prognostic,7 but others do not.8,9 ERCC1 gene polymorphisms
have also been investigated, but results are inconsistent for NSCLC,
again often on the basis of retrospective studies.10-12
Analyses of stored samples from 761 resected patients with
early-stage NSCLC (International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial
[IALT]) suggested that platinum chemotherapy versus no che-
motherapy had a different effect among ERCC1-negative patients
(HR, 0.65) than among ERCC1-positive patients (HR, 1.14; P = .006).13
Consequently, several centers use ERCC1 to customize treatment.
Review articles and the Centre for Comparative Effectiveness Research
in Cancer Genomics identified ERCC1 as a top research priority
because its use lacked high-quality evidence, with current evidence
on the basis of retrospective studies.14,15
We conducted the first—to our knowledge—large, phase III
study to prospectively evaluate ERCC1 in any tumor type as
a predictive and prognostic biomarker.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Design and Participants
The ERCC1 trial (ET) was a phase III randomized trial conducted
across 85 UK hospitals to determine whether nonplatinum therapy is
superior to platinum therapy for patients with NSCLC with ERCC1-
positive tumors, but noninferior for patients with ERCC1-negative
tumors. Inclusion criteria were age $ 18 years with histologic con-
firmation of advanced NSCLC (stage IIIb or IV), no prior chemo-
therapy, one or more measurable lesions (Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors v1.1 [RECIST v1.1]), Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status of 0 to 1, and stable brain metastases (if present).
Centers that routinely performed EGFR testing did not refer EGFR-positive
patients to ET.
The trial had ethics approval and was conducted according to the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Random Assignment
Registered patients had their tumor sample sent for central ERCC1
testing and were only randomly assigned after the result was known. Random
assignment was performed by telephoning the Trials Center, where a com-
puter program allocated patients by using minimization, stratified by ERCC1
status (positive v negative), disease stage (IIIb v IV), smoking history (never,
former, or current), and hospital. This was done separately for nonsquamous
(includes adenocarcinoma, large cell, and not otherwise specified) and
squamous patients because of the different treatments.
Procedures
Small biopsied specimens that were obtained mainly from primary
tumors (formalin fixed and paraffin embedded) were sent to University
College London Advanced Diagnostics—a Clinical Pathology Accredited
and Host Laboratory for the UK National External Quality Assessment
Service—for centralized ERCC1 testing (immunohistochemistry).
We used an approved 8F1 ERCC1 antibody (Neomarkers, Fisher
Scientific, Loughborough, UK) and clone Ab-2 (8F1; 1/300 dilution) and
fully automated Leica Biosystems Bond III. Two expert pathologists (M.F.
and A.C.) scored each sample blindly, classifying ERCC1 positive as
moderate expression in $ 50% of tumor cells, or strong expression in
$ 10% of tumor cells.13 The quality control validation process involved
testing each new antibody batch against established controls from both
normal tonsil and tumors with known ERCC1 expression to ensure re-
producibility and accurate interpretation.
From April 2013, after new information about the ERCC1-8F1
antibody,16 the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) and
investigators added anti–XPF clone 3F2/3 (AbCam, Cambridge, UK),
which is specific for the XPF-ERCC1 protein complex,17 because XPF
is also involved in the repair of the cytotoxic platinum DNA adduct. Thirty-
four patient samples were measured prospectively and 614 retrospectively.
Random assignment was still based on the ERCC1-8F1 antibody. XPF was
scored by using QuickScore (familiar to many pathologists)18 as the sum of
staining intensity (score 1 to 3) and proportion of cells stained (score 1 to 5),
with a score of $ 6 signifying positive staining for the ERCC1-XPF complex.
Doublet chemotherapy was administered once every three weeks, up
to 6 cycles (using standard regimens). Squamous patients were randomly
assigned to cisplatin 75 mg/m2 day 1 plus gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m2 days 1
and 8, or to paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 day 1 plus gemcitabine. Nonsquamous
patients were randomly assigned to cisplatin plus pemetrexed 500mg/m2
day 1, or to paclitaxel plus pemetrexed. Paclitaxel was used because it is more
cost effective than docetaxel, with little association between ERCC1 expression
and sensitivities to paclitaxel (regimens used from prior phase II studies).19
Clinical examinations, biochemistry, and chest x-rays were per-
formed at baseline, before each chemotherapy cycle, and monthly until
1 year from the start of the first chemotherapy cycle, then every 2 months
thereafter. Chest and abdomen computed tomography scans were per-
formed after cycles 2, 4, and 6, or when clinically indicated thereafter.
Statistical Considerations
The primary end point was OS. Secondary end points were progression-
free survival (PFS), tumor response, adverse events, chemotherapy adherence,
and health-related quality of life (European Organisation for Research and
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 and LC13).20
For ERCC1-negative patients, the expected median OS was 9 months
(United Kingdom audit data), with a noninferiority margin of 1.5 months
(HR should not be $ 1.2), which required 669 deaths (80% power, 5%
one-sided statistical significance). For ERCC1-positive patients, we aimed
to increase OS from 9 months (platinum) to 11.5 months (nonplatinum),
a minimum clinically important benefit (target HR # 0.78, which required
511 deaths; 80% power, 5% two-sided statistical significance. Total target
was 1,272 patients.
Analyses were by intention-to-treat. Time-to-event end points were
analyzed by using the log rank test and Cox proportional hazards re-
gression model, measured from the random assignment date. For OS,
surviving patients were censored at the date last seen alive, and for PFS,
an event was RECIST progression or death from any cause and those
without an event were censored when last seen alive. ERCC1 and XPF
were each examined as predictive—that is, whether the marker status
influenced the OS or PFS HR for nonplatinum versus platinum, using
an interaction test—and prognostic—that is, whether marker status is
correlated with OS or PFS, using multivariable Cox proportional hazards
regression. Toxicities were based on the maximum National Cancer In-
stitute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity grade for
each patient and event. Quality of life was analyzed by using mixed modeling
for repeated measures.

 Early Stopping
Since September 2012, we excluded squamous patients after the
IDMC observed that OS and PFS were significantly better with plat-
inum therapy. Squamous histology patients who were still taking
nonplatinum treatment and their clinicians were informed and rec-
ommended to switch to platinum therapy, unless there was benefit. In
July 2013, the IDMC recommended closing the trial for two reasons:
reanalysis of the IALT16 indicated that the 8F1-ERCC1 antibody was
questionable, with updated results showing it to not be predictive, and
our observed ET data were consistent with these findings (OS HR, 1.08
among ERCC1-positive patients, and the 0.78 target was unlikely to be
achieved if ET continued).
RESULTS
Of patients, 648 were randomly assigned between October 2009
and July 2013 (Fig 1). Baseline characteristics were similar between
groups (Table 1).

had already finished their chemotherapy or had died previously. *Minimization was used to randomly assign patients, but only after excision repair cross complementing group 1
(ERCC1) status and histology were known. Squamous patients were then randomly assigned between each treatment arm using stratification factors ERCC1, smoking, stage,
and center. This process ensured balance between the arms for each of these factors, such that they do not differ between the groups (and hence would not act as
confounders). The same was done separately for nonsquamous patients. EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; NSCLC, non–small-cell lung cancer.

 ERCC1 results were available for 95% of patients within 3 days
after the central laboratory received samples (Appendix Table A1,
online only). The ERCC1-positive rate for all patients was 60.6%
(386 of 637 patients) or 69.9% (332 of 475 patients) using the 8F1
or anti-XPF antibodies, respectively. Corresponding positive rates
were 54.5% (253 of 464 patients) and 70.5% (234 of 332 patients)
for nonsquamous histology, and 76.7% (133 of 173 patients) and
68.5% (98 of 143 patients) for squamous histology. Appendix Table
A2 (online only) lists the concordance between ERCC1 and XPF.
Chemotherapy Adherence
Thirty two patients did not start trial chemotherapy after
random assignment (Appendix Table A3, online only). Among
those who started treatment, the percentage of patients who
completed at least four cycles was 67.9% (platinum) versus 60.2%
(nonplatinum) for those with nonsquamous histology (P = .11),
and 58.7 versus 54.2% (P = .64) for those with squamous histology.
Appendix Table A4 (online only) lists reasons for nonadherence.
There was no material difference in the number of cycles
(P = .09, nonsquamous; and P = .25, squamous histology). The
proportions with dose reductions were broadly similar, but more
patients seemed to have dose delays in the platinum therapy groups
(both histologies). Median drug dose administered was as ex-
pected, without differences between groups (Appendix Table A5,
online only). Additional treatments after trial chemotherapy are
listed in Appendix Table A6 (online only).
ERCC1 and XPF as Predictive Biomarkers
Among evaluable patients with squamous histology, the
partial or complete tumor response rate was 51.6% (platinum)
versus 26.5% (nonplatinum; P = .004), and was similar for ERCC1-
positive patients (50.0 v 27.4%) and ERCC1-negative patients
(57.1 v 23.5%; Appendix Table A7, online only). Among those with
nonsquamous histology, the response rate was higher for platinum
therapy versus nonplatinum therapy (48.4 v 33.0%; P = .04) in
patients who were ERCC1 positive and similar in patients who were
ERCC1 negatives (32.9 v 39.0%; P = .51). Appendix Table A8
(online only) lists odds ratios for ERCC1 as a predictive marker of
response, with no evidence of an association among squamous
histology patients (interaction P = .58). Although the interaction
P value was of borderline statistical significance for nonsquamous
subtypes (P = .04), results for ERCC1-positive patients contrasted
with our hypothesis.
Median follow-up was 30 months; there were 563 deaths (511
from lung cancer) and 594 PFS events. OS and PFS were similar
between nonsquamous histology patients who received platinum
therapy and nonplatinum therapy (Fig 2). For squamous histology
patients, OS and PFS were significantly better with platinum
therapy compared with nonplatinum treatment (Fig 2).
Baseline characteristics were similar between ERCC1-positive
patients and ERCC1-negative patients (Appendix Table A9, online
only). Appendix Fig A1 (online only) shows Kaplan-Meier curves
comparing platinum treatment and nonplatinum treatment
according to ERCC1 status (8F1 antibody) in all patients (HRs are
for nonplatinum v platinum therapy). There was no evidence of
superiority for nonplatinum therapy (OS or PFS) among ERCC1-
positive patients; however, because the effects differed between
squamous and nonsquamous subtypes, results are presented sep-
arately hereafter. Figure 3 and Appendix Fig A2 (online only) show
no evidence for a treatment-by-ERCC1 interaction for either OS
(P = .64 nonsquamous; P = .51 squamous histology) or PFS (P = .84

 nonsquamous; P = .12 squamous). Among patients with non-
squamous histology, although the observed OS HR of 0.99 was
within the noninferiority limit of 1.20 in ERCC1-negative patients,
the HR in positive patients (1.11) was not lower than the target effect
of 0.78, and the median OS was higher with platinum therapy
(9.6 months v 8.0 months; Fig 3). Among patients with squamous
histology, all HRs exceeded 1.0 regardless of ERCC1 status (Appendix
Fig A2).
Results were similar after excluding 32 patients who did not start
trial chemotherapy and censoring four patients with squamous
histology when they switched from nonplatinum therapy to
platinum therapy after the IDMC recommendation, or after
excluding patients randomly assigned to platinum therapy who later
received a taxane (docetaxel) as well as those randomly assigned
to paclitaxel who later received platinum therapy (Appendix
Table A10, online only).
We conducted similar analyses for XPF. Baseline character-
istics were similar between XPF-negative patients and XPF-positive
patients (Appendix Table A11, online only). Kaplan-Meier curves
are shown in Fig 4 (nonsquamous) and Appendix Fig A3 (online
only; squamous). OS seemed to be better for platinum treatment
than for nonplatinum treatment among patients with non-
squamous histology who were XPF negative, though not sta-
tistically significant at the 0.05 level (median 11.6 months v
8.9 months; HR, 1.39; P = 1.14), but given the OS HR (1.09)
among XPF-positive patients, interaction P value was .35. This was
in contrast to an apparent survival benefit for platinum therapy in
squamous histology patients who were XPF positive (OS HR, 1.65;
P = .02; PFS HR, 1.88; P = .003), with no effect among XPF-
negative patients (OS HR, 1.06; P = .86; PFS HR, 1.30; P = .39;
interaction P = .21 for OS). Using higher scores to categorize
patients as XPF positive produced similar results (Appendix Table
A12, online only).
Analyses that examined the predictive effects of ERCC1 or
XPF according to sex, disease stage, and smoking did not show any
subgroup effects (Appendix Table A13, online only).
We combined ERCC1 and XPF and still found no evidence
that they were predictive. OS HR among patients with non-
squamous subtypes who were positive for both markers was 1.09
(95% CI, 0.78 to 1.51) compared with 1.16 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.99)

 for patients who were negative for both markers, that is, not
materially different. The corresponding HRs for squamous his-
tology were 1.56 (95% CI, 1.00 to 2.43) and 1.82 (95% CI, 0.64 to
5.17), respectively.
ERCC1 and XPF As Prognostic Biomarkers
Unlike many retrospective studies,6 neither ERCC1 nor XPF
were prognostic markers for OS or PFS (Table 2 and Appendix
Fig A4, online only; HRs are for marker positive v negative). All
but one of the associations indicated that ERCC1-positive pa-
tients or XPF-positive patients had outcomes that were similar
to patients who were negative, overall or within each treatment
group (the association [PFS HR, 1.86 in squamous histology]
had a P value of .03, possibly as a result of multiple testing and
only 84 patients). Similar conclusions were made after com-
bining ERCC1 and XPF: the adjusted OS HR comparing pa-
tients who were positive for both markers with those who
were negative for both was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.44) for
nonsquamous histology, and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.51 to 1.47) for squa-
mous histology.
Adverse Events and Quality of Life
The proportion of patients who experienced any grade 3 to 5
adverse events was similar between platinum and nonplatinum
groups: 66.7% versus 70.8% (squamous, P = .56), and 69.1%
versus 72.2% (nonsquamous, P = .46; Appendix Tables A14 and
A15, online only). Health-related quality of life was also broadly
similar (Appendix Table A16, online only).
DISCUSSION
ET is the first randomized phase III study in advanced NSCLC
specifically designed to evaluate prospective testing of ERCC1 as
a predictive biomarker. Neither tumor ERCC1 nor XPF protein

 expression using commercially available antibodies predicted
outcomes for platinum therapy or nonplatinum chemotherapy.
More patients with squamous histology had high ERCC1
expression (77%) than did nonsquamous patients (55%), which is
similar to other reports.13,21 Despite this higher rate, which was
thought to be associated with platinum resistance, platinum
therapy was significantly better (response rate, PFS, and OS) than
nonplatinum therapy in patients with squamous histology. Results
for squamous histology patients indicated that OS (10.7 months v
7.6 months), PFS (8.0 months v 5.0 months), and response rate
(51.6% v 26.5%) after platinum therapy were all better than ex-
pected, even though the patient group seemed similar to those
reported in practice and studies (Appendix Table A17, online
only).22,23 Squamous NSCLC might have different DNA repair
profiles for platinum and nonplatinum therapy compared with
nonsquamous subtypes, thus warranting further investigation. To
our knowledge, this is the first time any randomized trial has
shown superior outcomes among squamous NSCLC treated with
platinum versus nonplatinum therapy, and these patients should
continue to have this.
For nonsquamous tumors, although nonplatinum therapy
was noninferior to platinum therapy among ERCC1-negative patients
(OS HR, 0.99), we could not demonstrate that nonplatinum was
superior among ERCC1-positive patients (OS HR, 1.11; superiority
P = 0.60; target HR, 0.78).
We also did not find a correlation between ERCC1 and OS
and PFS, unlike that reported in retrospective studies. OS among
nonsquamous histology patients with ERCC1-positive tumors
was similar to those who were negative (median, 9.6 months v
11.6 months; HR, 1.05).
Our study strengths were as follows: evaluation of both the
8F1-ERCC1 and 3F2-XPF antibodies assessed centrally by two
consultant pathologists which increased the accuracy and re-
liability of the analysis; the ability to examine each marker as
predictive or prognostic; and ERCC1 was measured pro-
spectively in all patients in real time, with ERCC1 stratification
incorporated into the randomization to ensure balance be-
tween treatment groups.
Only three previous trials have measured ERCC1 pro-
spectively, but all used it to direct treatment and so they could not

 allow for any prognostic interaction effect of ERCC1,24-26 and
there was no comparator group without directed treatment. Two
trials considered ERCC1 to influence response rates,24,25 whereas
the other found no effect.26 ET has the only design that is able to
compare platinum therapy with nonplatinum therapy in each
ERCC1-positive and ERCC1-negative group, that is, a marker-by-
treatment interaction design.27
We encountered some challenges: introduction of routine
local EGFR mutation testing at hospitals competed with ET for
tissue blocks of eligible patients; 25% of samples received were
small and were just enough for ERCC1 testing; and 70 patients
were not randomly assigned because of insufficient sample. ET
was designed and set up in 2008 when the 8F1-assay for ERCC1
was in common use, but after accumulating evidence, the re-
liability of this assay was questioned. It would be difficult to
switch to another biomarker in the prospective randomization
process, which is an important potential problem for future
biomarker-driven trials.
Several reasons might explain our findings. First, lack of
specificity of ERCC1 immunohistochemistry testing, despite
using the recommended 8F1 antibody when our trial was
launched.17,28-31 Second, although the 55% observed ERCC1-
positive rate for nonsquamous histology patients in our trial is
within the range reported from other studies (31% to 65%), some
variability may be a result of different fixation methods, newer
antibody batches, and different thresholds for classifying posi-
tivity.6 Of interest, within the IALT, the rate was 44% in 2006 but
77% in the subsequent reanalyses of the same samples using
a different antibody batch.13,16 During ET, the ERCC1-positive rate
did not change noticeably over time, despite using different an-
tibody batches.
In the 2006 IALTreport,13 the OS HR for chemotherapy versus
no therapy was 0.65 among ERCC1-negative patients, but 1.14 in
ERCC1-positive patients, with a strong treatment-by-ERCC1 in-
teraction (P = .009). However, reanalyses of the same samples using
a different batch produced corresponding HRs of 0.81 and 0.96,
respectively, with no evidence that ERCC1 was predictive (in-
teraction P = .53).16 Analyses of two other trials with the later batch
showed similar inconsistent results.16 The authors concluded that
only one of four ERCC1 protein isoforms (202) had full capacity
for nucleotide excision repair and cisplatin resistance, but none of
the 16 commercially available antibodies distinguishes between
them.16,32 Processing issues associated with ERCC1 testing requires
a validated standard procedure to be developed for future
studies.6,33
After reports on the specificity of the 8F1 antibody to detect
functional ERCC1 during ET (first raised by Bhagwat et al,17 who
found it cross-reacted with an unrelated protein), we revised our
protocol to also examine the obligate XPF partner protein ex-
pression by using an anti-XPF antibody.17 Repair of the cytotoxic
platinum DNA adducts involve the ERCC1-XPF heterodimer
complex.34,35 XPF expression using 3F2 anti-XPF antibody could
be a better predictive biomarker than 8F1-ERCC1 for platinum
therapy,17,36 and targeting XPF-ERCC1 by RNA interference in-
creases cisplatin efficacy.37 Several studies suggest a role of XPF in
platinum resistance.37,38 In ET, we observed that patients with
nonsquamous histology who were XPF negative derived some
benefit from platinum therapy (HR, 1.39; P = .14), but this is
inconclusive and there was little association in XPF-positive pa-
tients (HR, 1.09; P = .52).
Because the active ERCC1 202 isoform is associated with
XPF to form the only functional heterodimer,32 such that
a coexpression between ERCC1 and XPF dimers might have
a stronger predictive value than either marker alone, we an-
alyzed our data for patients who were positive for both ERCC1
and XPF (compared with those who were negative for both). We

 again found no evidence for them to be either prognostic or
predictive.
Although the IDMC stopped ET early, it was not un-
derpowered. The primary objective was to show that non-
platinum therapy is more effective than platinum therapy
among ERCC1-positive patients. Conditional power is the
chance of obtaining the target OS HR of # 0.78 if the trial had
continued to the planned end (target 511 deaths), given the
observed number of deaths and observed HR. It would have
been futile to continue because conditional power was small: , 0.01%
among all patients (352 deaths), and 7% among nonsquamous
subtypes (225 deaths).
In conclusion, patients with advanced squamous NSCLC
who were treated with nonplatinum chemotherapy had sig-
nificantly worse outcomes than did those who were treated with
platinum chemotherapy. Prospectively selecting the type of
chemotherapy using the 8F1 or XPF antibody for ERCC1 did
not predict OS or PFS for either histologic subtype. Further-
more, ERCC1 and XPF were not prognostic markers for ad-
vanced NCSLC. Neither ERCC1 nor XPF, using current
commercial tests, should be used in routine practice without
further investigation. Future studies could focus on developing
assays that target the functional ERCC1 202 protein, which may
be associated with cisplatin resistance.

hazard ratio (HR), 1.0. One-tailed P value for the null hypothesis of HR $ 1.20 versus alternative HR , 1.20 (ie, the prespecified noninferiority margin) is 0.34 where P , .05
is evidence for noninferiority. HRs for nonplatinum versus platinum therapy.

*Appendix Table A6: The following patients were excluded (acknowledging this will not be based on a full randomized comparison): Patients randomly assigned to and
started cisplatin and pemetrexed who had any docetaxel (taxane) therapy later. Patients randomly assigned to and started paclitaxel and pemetrexed who had any
platinum therapy later on.

NOTE. In relation to sex, disease stage, and smoking. Data are given as hazard ratios and 95% CIs for nonplatinum versus platinum therapy, among patients with
nonsquamous histology, and smoking status for squamous histology (because of potential correlation with ERCC1). Nonsmoker is defined as never smoker plus former
smokers. There are only two interaction P values , .05, but only P = .03 (weak evidence for interaction), possibly as a result of chance, given the multiple analyses above.

Scores range from 0 to 100 for each item. For the global health and functional scales, 0 indicates poor health and 100 good health. For all other scales, 0 indicates no
symptoms and 100 high level of symptoms. The mean difference is the treatment effect for nonplatinum minus platinum, from a repeated measures mixed model,
allowing for the baseline values. For the global health and functional scales, a positive mean difference indicates that nonplatinum was better and a negative difference
indicates that platinum was better. For all other scales, a negative mean difference indicates that nonplatinum was better and a positive difference indicates that platinum
was better. 99% CIs are shown because there are multiple analyses. As expected, paclitaxel and pemetrexed was associated with fewer patients with nausea and
vomiting in nonsquamous patients (P = .001). Platinum therapy caused less peripheral neuropathy and alopecia in both squamous and nonsquamous patients (P , .001
for both).
