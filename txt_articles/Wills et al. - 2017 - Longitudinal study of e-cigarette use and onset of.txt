ABSTRACT
Objective Use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) is
prevalent among adolescents, but there is little
knowledge about the consequences of their use. We
examined, longitudinally, how e-cigarette use among
adolescents is related to subsequent smoking behaviour.
Methods Longitudinal school-based survey with a
baseline sample of 2338 students (9th and 10th
graders, mean age 14.7 years) in Hawaii surveyed in
2013 (time 1, T1) and followed up 1 year later (time 2,
T2). We assessed e-cigarette use, tobacco cigarette use,
and psychosocial covariates (demographics, parental
support and monitoring, and sensation seeking and
rebelliousness). Regression analyses including the
covariates tested whether e-cigarette use was related to
the onset of smoking among youth who had never
smoked cigarettes, and to change in smoking frequency
among youth who had previously smoked cigarettes.
Results Among T1 never-smokers, those who had used
e-cigarettes at T1 were more likely to have smoked
cigarettes at T2; for a complete-case analysis, adjusted
OR=2.87, 95% CI 2.03 to 4.05, p<0.0001. Among
ever-smokers at T1, using e-cigarettes was not related to
significant change in their frequency of smoking at T2.
Uptake of e-cigarette use among T1 never-users of
either product was predicted by age, Caucasian or
Native Hawaiian (vs Asian-American) ethnicity, lower
parental education and parental support, higher
rebelliousness, and perception of e-cigarettes as
healthier.
Conclusions Adolescents who use e-cigarettes are
more likely to start smoking cigarettes. This result
together with other findings suggests that policies
restricting adolescents’ access to e-cigarettes may have a
rationale from a public health standpoint.
BACKGROUND
Adolescent use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes)
is an emerging public health issue.1 2 The preva-
lence for ever use among US high school students
increased from 1–3% in 2010–2011 to 10–20% in
2013–2014.3 4 Similar increases have occurred in
European and Asian countries.5 6 Recent US studies
of regional samples have shown prevalence rates in
the range from 25% to 29%,7–9 and e-cigarette use
has surpassed cigarette use in some studies.4 10
These findings have sparked a debate about ado-
lescent e-cigarette use.1
11–13 E-cigarettes could
produce
a
public
health
benefit
if
they
help
smokers to quit smoking tobacco cigarettes.12 13
Alternatively, being exposed to e-cigarettes market-
ing14–16 and e-cigarette use in smoke-free areas
may contribute to renormalising smoking,11 which
could increase smoking initiation and deter quitting
among adolescents. However, there is little evi-
dence from longitudinal studies on the relationship
between adolescent e-cigarette use and smoking.
One study with adolescents17 and one with young
adults18 have found that e-cigarette use is positively
related
to
initiation
of
smoking.
Furthermore,
cross-sectional studies have reported a relationship
between e-cigarette use among adolescent and
young adult non-smokers, and intention19 20 and
willingness21 to smoke. Because of the policy impli-
cations,1 11 12 it is important to have evidence from
different
settings
on
the
relation
between
e-
cigarette use and smoking.
To address this question, we measured e-cigarette
use and smoking on two occasions (1 year apart)
among high school students. Our primary aim was
to test whether e-cigarette use is related to the
onset of smoking; thus, among adolescents who
had never smoked at time 1 (T1), we determined
the likelihood of smoking at time 2 (T2) as a func-
tion of previous e-cigarette use. A second aim was
to determine longitudinal predictors for e-cigarette
uptake, as most previous studies have been cross-
sectional.1 2 A third aim was to determine if e-
cigarette use was associated with smoking reduction
among baseline smokers.13 All analyses controlled
for a range of demographic and psychosocial cov-
ariates, variables that could be correlated with e-
cigarette use and with smoking.
METHODS
Schools on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, were
selected to be representative of school systems in
Hawaii. Previous studies have shown that predictive
relationships found in Hawaii for adolescent sub-
stance use are similar to results obtained in other
areas.9 21 22
Participants and procedure
Six of the seven invited high schools participated in
the study; there were four public and two private
schools. At T1 (2013; N=2338), 49% of the parti-
cipants were 9th graders, 42% were 10th graders
and 9% were 11th graders, and the age range was
14–16 years (M age 14.7 years, SD=0.7). The par-
ticipants
were
resurveyed
approximately
1 year
later at T2 (2014; N=2239) when M age was
15.8 years (SD=0.9). The T1 sample was 53%
female, 24% were of Asian-American background
(Chinese,
Japanese
or
Korean),
19%
were
Caucasian, 27% were Filipino-American, 20% were

 Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and 10% were of
other race/ethnicity. Regarding family structure, 17% of partici-
pants lived with a single parent, 12% were in a step-parent
family (one or both parents being step-parent), 60% lived with
two biological parents, and 11% were in an extended family
structure (two parents plus two or more relatives in the house-
hold). The mean for a father’s education, on a 1–6 scale, with
anchor-points grade school and post-college was 4.2 (SD=1.2).
The sampling frame at both assessments was all students in
the target grades with adequate English language ability. The
research was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the
University of Hawaii and the Hawaii State Department of
Education. Signed parental consent and signed student assent
were required at each assessment. The response rates were 70%
at T1 and 67% at T2.
The paper survey took 40 min and was administered by
trained research staff in school classrooms. Students were
instructed that data were completely confidential and that they
should not write their name on the survey. Participants were
assigned an arbitrary numerical code to de-identify surveys
while linking participants across data collection points. Most
non-participation was due to parents not returning the consent
form (71% of missing cases at both waves).
Measures
The same previously validated measures22–25 were administered
at both assessments. Variables were all scored such that a higher
score reflects a higher level of the indicated variable.
Demographic variables included gender and age (written in
years), family structure (‘What adults do you live with right
now?’ with nine response alternatives); parental education
(‘What is the highest level of education your father/mother has
completed?’ with six fixed responses from grade school to post-
college); and ethnicity (14 options: Native American/Alaska
Native, Black (African-American), Chinese, Hispanic (Latino),
Native
Hawaiian,
Filipino,
Japanese/Okinawan,
Korean,
Micronesian, Portugese, Samoan, Southeast Asian, Tongan,
White (Caucasian)). Students who checked more than one ethni-
city were asked ‘If you had to choose only one, what would you
say?’ and this item was used to index primary perceived
ethnicity.
E-cigarette and cigarette measures: T
wo items with No/Yes
responses asked, ‘Have you ever heard of or seen an electronic
cigarette (e-cigarette, Volcanos) before?’, and ‘Do you think
smoking electronic cigarettes is healthier than regular cigar-
ettes?’ The item on e-cigarette use asked: ‘Which of the follow-
ing is most true for you about smoking electronic cigarettes
(e-cigarettes, Volcanos)? (Check One)’. A 0–6 scale had response
points ‘I have never smoked an e-cigarette in my life’, ‘I have
smoked e-cigarettes 1–2 times’, ‘I have smoked e-cigarettes 3–4
times’, ‘I usually smoke a few e-cigarettes a year’, ‘I usually
smoke a few e-cigarettes a month’, ‘I usually smoke a few e-
cigarettes each week’, and ‘I usually smoke e-cigarettes every
day’. The item on cigarette use had the stem, ‘Which of the fol-
lowing is most true for you about smoking cigarettes? (Check
One)’, and also had a 0–6 response scale (‘I have never smoked
cigarettes in my life’ to ‘I usually smoke cigarettes every day’).
T1 never-smokers who reported any smoking at T2 were con-
sidered to have initiated smoking.
Several variables were included as psychosocial covariates
because they could be correlated with e-cigarette use and with
cigarette use (for sources, see ref. 9 24 25). Items were intro-
duced with the stem, ‘Here are some things that people may say
about themselves. Read each one and circle a number (from 1
to 5) to show what is true for you’. Responses were on five-
point Likert scales (‘Not at All True for Me’ to ‘Very True for
Me’). Parental support was a seven-item scale (α =0.94 and
0.94 for T1 and T2, respectively) assessing the perceived avail-
ability of emotional and instrumental support from parents (eg,
‘When I feel bad about something, my parent will listen’).
Parental monitoring was a five-item scale (α=0.75 and 0.75)
indexing the extent to which parents were aware of the youth’s
activities
(‘My
parent
knows
where
I
am
after
school’).
Sensation seeking was a five-item scale (α=0.75 and 0.75)
indexing the extent to which the youth desired novel and excit-
ing
activities
(‘I
like
to
do
dangerous
things
for
fun’).
Rebelliousness was a five-item scale (α=0.84 and 0.81) indexing
the extent to which the youth liked to do things he/she was not
supposed to (‘I like to break the rules’).
Analysis methods
Univariate frequency distributions described the prevalence of e-
cigarette use and cigarette use at each time point. T
o determine
the proportions of participants in various user groups, we classi-
fied participants into four ever use groups at each time point
(Cigarette Only Use, E-cigarette Only Use, Dual Use (Cigarettes +
E-cigarettes), and Non-user (never used either product)), and
a cross-classification of usage status at both time points was per-
formed. All multivariable analyses controlled for demographics,
parenting and personality variables, and adjusted for clustering
within schools. To obtain an empirical basis for defining use, a
preliminary logistic regression analysis, conducted for persons
who had never smoked cigarettes, modelled the likelihood of
T2 smoking onset (ever used vs never used) in relation to level
of T1 e-cigarette use. On the basis of this analysis, ever use of e-
cigarettes was selected as the basic definition of use for subse-
quent analyses. To determine the relationship between e-
cigarette use and smoking initiation, a multilevel logistic regres-
sion analysis using the SAS V
.9.4 SURVEYLOGISTIC procedure,
adjusting for covariates, and clustering within schools, tested
how T1 e-cigarette use predicted onset of smoking at T2 among
persons who had never smoked cigarettes at T1. To address the
predictors of e-cigarette uptake, a multinomial regression ana-
lysis including covariates determined which of the study vari-
ables predicted T2 change in e-cigarette usage status among the
T1 non-user group. To address whether e-cigarette use is related
to reduction in smoking, a multilevel linear regression analysis
using the SAS V
.9.4 MIXED procedure tested how T1 e-
cigarette use predicted change in the 0–6 smoking score from
T1 to T2 among persons who had ever smoked cigarettes at T1.
Because of convergence issues, parental education and the psy-
chosocial covariates were analysed as tertiles. Sensation seeking
and parental monitoring were substantially correlated with
other covariates, and did not show significant unique contribu-
tions to outcomes when entered together with the other covari-
ates in a multivariable model. Hence, the models reported here
included age, gender, ethnicity, parental education, parental
support and rebelliousness as the covariates.
W
e analysed attrition between T1 and T2 using t tests to
compare baseline data for participants who were surveyed at
both T1 and T2 with data for participants who provided data at
T1 but not at T2. Consistent with typical findings in longitu-
dinal studies of adolescents,26 there was some differential attri-
tion
(ie,
more
attrition
among
persons
with
higher
rebelliousness or lower parental support scores). However, the
effect sizes were small (for Cohen d, range=0.10 to 0.23,
mean=0.18), and a multivariable analysis showed that these
variables together accounted for only 3% of the variance in

data at T1 and T2 (complete-case analysis; N=1302), and also
including
those
who

(full-information
analysis;
N=2772).28 The full-information analysis was based on mul-
tiple imputation, employing Proc MI in SAS with 20 imputa-
tions using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method,29 so as to
use all data from the 2338 T1 cases plus 434 T2 only cases.30
RESULTS
As shown in table 1, 31% of the sample had ever used e-
cigarettes at T1, and 38% at T2; while 15% of the sample had
ever smoked cigarettes at T1, and 21% at T2. The increase in
use over time for both products is consistent with age trends
typically observed in adolescent research.27 31 Prevalence rates
for e-cigarette use are similar to, although somewhat higher
than, rates from several recent studies,5 7 8 but rates for cigarette
smoking tend to be lower in Hawaii, which has been attributed
to high taxation and strict restrictions on sales of tobacco to the
underaged.32 Data for T1 indicated that 96% of participants
were aware of e-cigarettes, and that 68% considered them
healthier than cigarettes.
Longitudinal patterns based on cross-classification of the four
usage categories at both time points are presented in table 2. Of
the original e-cigarette-only group (second row of table 2), 20%
had initiated smoking at T2. This compared with a lower onset
rate among persons who were non-users of either product at T1
(first row of table 2). Of the group who were non-users of
either product at T1 (first row of table 2), 10% had initiated
only e-cigarette use at T2, 2% only cigarette smoking, and 4%
both.
Of the T1 ever-users of e-cigarettes, 28% had used e-
cigarettes once or twice, 38% had used them 3–4 times, and
34% had used them more often. A preliminary logistic regres-
sion analysis including covariates, conducted for the subsample
of adolescents who had never smoked a cigarette at T1, mod-
elled the probability of T2 smoking status (never smoked vs
ever smoked) as a function of level of e-cigarette use at T1.
Results for a complete-case analysis (table 3) indicated that ORs
for the likelihood of onset of smoking by T2 were significant
for each level; that is, any level of T1 e-cigarette use was related
to a significantly higher likelihood of onset of smoking. Pairwise
comparisons with T
ukey-Kramer adjustment indicated that each
level of e-cigarette use differed significantly from never used,
but the four levels of e-cigarette use did not differ significantly
from each other; this is analogous to a pattern previously
observed for attitudinal willingness to smoke.21 Accordingly, we
employed ever use of e-cigarettes as the basic definition of use
for subsequent analyses. Supplementary analyses were per-
formed using progressively stricter criteria for defining smoking
status at T2 (ie, 3–4 times or higher, yearly or higher, and
monthly or higher). These indicated that any level of e-cigarette
use at T1 was related to smoking 1–2 times or 3–4 times at T2,
but regular (yearly or monthly) smoking at T2 was only related
to higher levels of e-cigarette use at T1 (see online supplemen-
tary table S1).
Logistic regression analysis
For the overall test of onset of smoking, a multilevel (students
nested within schools) logistic regression analysis, based on par-
ticipants who had never smoked cigarettes at T1, predicted T2
smoking status (never smoked vs ever smoked) from T1 e-
cigarette ever use, including the covariates. Effect sizes were
stronger for the complete-case analysis than the full-information
analysis, but were significant in both analyses (table 4). In each
model, the OR for T1 e-cigarette ever use predicting T2 onset
of smoking was positive and significant. For example, in the first
analysis, the model-computed probability of being a T2 smoker
was 5% for T1 e-cigarette never-users and was 14% for T1
ever-users. That is, the multivariable analysis indicated that par-
ticipants were about three times more likely to start smoking if
they had ever used e-cigarettes.
Three covariates (age, ethnicity and rebelliousness) independ-
ently predicted onset of smoking. Onset of smoking was more
likely for adolescents who were older (OR=1.49, CI 1.08 to
2.06, p=0.02). Compared with Asian-Americans, Caucasians
were more likely to begin smoking (OR=2.67, CI 1.69 to 4.26,
p<0.0001), as were Native Hawaiians (OR=2.27, CI 1.17 to
4.38, p=0.02). Additionally, onset of smoking was more likely
for adolescents who scored high at T1 on rebelliousness
(OR=2.09, CI 1.22 to 3.59, p=0.01). Gender, parental support
and parental education were not significantly related to onset of
smoking in the multivariable model.
A sensitivity analysis determined whether the onset results
were dependent on how use was defined (see online supplemen-
tary tables 2A,B). The multiple logistic regression analyses were
re-run using two more stringent cut-off levels to define e-
cigarette use and cigarette smoking. For example, in the first

 definition, a non-regular user was defined as the first two points
on the scale (never used, or used 1–2 times), and a regular user
as someone who had used 3–4 times or more.
The results were similar to those for ‘ever use’. The OR for
onset of smoking was 3.45 (CI 2.09 to 5.69) with the first defin-
ition, and 6.36 (CI 3.10 to 13.08) with the second definition,
indicating that the observed relationship between e-cigarette use
and onset of smoking does not depend on a particular definition
of use.
Other transition analyses
For predicting onset of e-cigarette use, a multinomial regression
model, including covariates, predicted change in usage category
membership among the T1 never-user group (first row of table
2). Results are shown in table 5 for the complete-case analysis
(similar for the full-information analysis). Using a conservative
probability level (p<0.01) for interpretation, adolescents were
more likely to transition from never-user to dual-user status
(ORs >1) if they were older; Caucasian or Native Hawaiian
(compared with Asian-American); more rebellious; and per-
ceived e-cigarettes as healthier. Adolescents with higher parental
support, and from families with more education, were less likely
to make this transition (OR<1). The transition to use of
e-cigarettes-only had many of the same predictors, but rebelli-
ousness had a smaller effect, whereas perception of e-cigarettes
as healthier had a larger effect. Transition to cigarette-only
status had similar predictors, but results were not consistently
significant.
To determine whether e-cigarette use was related to reduction
in smoking, a multiple regression analysis based on T1 ever-
smokers predicted T2 smoking score (log transformed) from T1
e-cigarette ever use and the covariates, including T1 smoking
score (log transformed) as a control. In the complete-case ana-
lysis, the regression coefficient for T1 e-cigarette use predicting
change in smoking score over time was b=0.08 (SE=0.10)
which is non-significant (p=0.44). The coefficient for T1
smoking was significant (b=0.73, SE=0.09, p<0.0001), reflect-
ing the stability of smoking over time, but none of the covariates
predicted change in the smoking score. This analysis did not
show e-cigarette use predicting a reduction over time in the fre-
quency of smoking. A similar conclusion was provided by the
full-information analysis.
DISCUSSION
The aim of this research was to determine whether e-cigarette
use in adolescence is longitudinally related to transitions in cig-
arette smoking. Prospective analyses tested the effect of e-
cigarette use for onset of smoking, including demographic and
psychosocial covariates that were themselves predictors of
smoking. Results showed the probability of onset of smoking
was higher among adolescents who used e-cigarettes, inde-
pendent of the covariates. Sensitivity analyses indicated this
finding was not dependent on a particular definition of use. We
also demonstrated that several of the study variables predicted
onset of e-cigarette-only use, or dual use. However, a test of
whether e-cigarette use by adolescent smokers was related to
reduction in their frequency of smoking did not show a signifi-
cant effect.

 E-cigarette use and health policy
These findings have implications for the current debate about e-
cigarettes.11–13 W
e found that e-cigarettes had a risk-promoting
effect for onset of smoking, and this study provided a relatively
strong test of the question, because at T1 there were a substan-
tial number of participants who had only used e-cigarettes, and
hence, were susceptible to transition. While some of the transi-
tion to dual use was attributable to other variables that are cor-
related with e-cigarette use (eg, ethnicity and rebelliousness), the
effect of e-cigarettes for onset of smoking was independent of
these variables. The present results converge with findings from
other studies of adolescents9 17–18 19–21 and provide support for
the hypothesis that e-cigarette use may promote initiation of
smoking.1 5 This suggests that e-cigarette use among adolescents
is not without behavioural costs. These findings should be con-
sidered for policy discussions about the availability of e-
cigarettes to adolescents.33
Some investigators have suggested that even if e-cigarette use
has costs, it may still provide a net public health benefit if e-
cigarettes enable smokers to quit or reduce smoking.13 This has
not generally been found in longitudinal studies of adult
smokers,1 and our analyses did not show a significant relation of
e-cigarette use to reduction in smoking among adolescents, par-
allel to findings from a study of Finnish adolescents.34 However,
the present study did not provide a strong test of the question
because the sample contained relatively few persons who only
smoked cigarettes. From a methodological standpoint, it should
also be noted that there was a certain level of error in the data,
as some persons who said at T1 that they had ever smoked
cigarettes or ever used e-cigarettes indicated at T2 that they
were never-users. This type of error has been observed in
national studies of adolescents,35 36 and is found across ages
and waves of data collection.37 Our supplemental analyses
addressed this issue, testing definitions more stringent than ever
use; results showed the findings on onset of smoking remained
significant with these alternative definitions.
Reasons for transition
The reasons for the effect of e-cigarette use on transition to
smoking remain to be clarified, but plausible hypotheses have
been suggested.1 2 38 39 One is that some e-cigarettes mimic the
look and feel of cigarettes, and the inhaling and exhaling of e-
cigarette aerosol produces some of the same sensory experiences
as smoking a cigarette. This similar experience may contribute
to an inclination towards trying cigarette smoking. Additionally,
nicotine exposure via e-cigarettes, even at lower levels, may sen-
sitise adolescents to its effects. If adolescents begin to experience
mild physiological effects from nicotine they may be inclined to
shift to cigarettes in order to get a bigger ‘kick’. This hypothesis
may help to account for the high prevalence of dual use
observed in adolescent samples.1 40
Some aspects of the present study could be noted as possible
limitations. The measure of e-cigarette use was relatively simple,
not covering the many types of products that are now avail-
able,1 2 and we measured cigarette smoking but not other forms
of tobacco use. As in most longitudinal studies, there was attri-
tion from the baseline sample, but we demonstrated that find-
ings
were
similar
for
complete-case
and
full-information
analyses that included variables related to attrition. There was
some misclassification in reports of smoking, which is typical
for studies of adolescent substance use,35–37 but measurement
error is compensated by having a large sample. It should be
noted that there are several types of influences that potentially
contribute to e-cigarette use and onset of smoking (eg, market-
ing, family attitudes and use). In the present research, we con-
trolled for a number of variables correlated with e-cigarette use
that index disposition to smoke cigarettes (eg, rebelliousness,
parental support), and found that the effect of e-cigarettes for
onset of smoking was significant in controlling for these predis-
posing factors. Further studies may include other types of cov-
ariates so as to ascertain unique effects of e-cigarette use for
patterns of adoption. Note that the rate of cigarette smoking
was relatively low in this population, and the majority of T1 e-
cigarette ever-users did not transition to cigarette smoking over
a 1-year period. Still, we were able to detect a significant effect
of e-cigarette use for increasing the likelihood of onset of
smoking, and we think this has public health implications.
What this paper adds
▸ E-cigarette use is known to be associated concurrently with
cigarette smoking, but the temporal relation between these
two behaviours had not been clear. Evidence from
longitudinal research is needed to determine whether
e-cigarette use precedes the onset of cigarette smoking.
▸ We followed a sample of high school students over a 1-year
interval, and found that among initial non-smokers, those
who used e-cigarettes were more likely to initiate cigarette
smoking. This suggests that e-cigarette use in adolescence
has behavioural costs, and this should be considered for
policy formulation.
