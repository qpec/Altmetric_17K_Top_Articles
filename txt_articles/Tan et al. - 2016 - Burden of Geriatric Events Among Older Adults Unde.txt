Purpose
Most malignancies are diagnosed in older adults who are potentially susceptible to aging-related
health conditions; however, the manifestation of geriatric syndromes during surgical cancer
treatment is not well quantified. Accordingly, we sought to assess the prevalence and ramifications
of geriatric events during major surgery for cancer.
Patients and Methods
Using Nationwide Inpatient Sample data from 2009 to 2011, we examined hospital admissions for
major cancer surgery among elderly patients (ie, age $ 65 years) and a referent group age 55 to 64
years. From these observations, we identified geriatric events that included delirium, dehydration,
falls and fractures, failure to thrive, and pressure ulcers. We then estimated the collective prevalence
of these events according to age, comorbidity, and cancer site and further explored their relationship
with other hospital-based outcomes.
Results
Within a weighted sample of 939,150 patients, we identified at least one event in 9.2% of patients.
Geriatric events were most common among patients age $ 75 years, with a Charlson comorbidity
score $ 2, and who were undergoing surgery for cancer of the bladder, ovary, colon and/or rectum,
pancreas, or stomach (P , .001). Adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, those patients
who experienced a geriatric event had a greater likelihood of concurrent complications (odds ratio
[OR], 3.73; 95% CI, 3.55 to 3.92), prolonged hospitalization (OR, 5.47; 95% CI, 5.16 to 5.80),
incurring high cost (OR, 4.97; 95% CI, 4.58 to 5.39), inpatient mortality (OR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.94 to
3.53), and a discharge disposition other than home (OR, 3.64; 95% CI, 3.46 to 3.84).
Conclusion
Many older patients who receive cancer-directed surgery experience a geriatric event, particularly
those who undergo major abdominal surgery. These events are linked to operative morbidity,
prolonged hospitalization, and more expensive health care. As our population ages, efforts focused
on addressing conditions and complications that are more common in older adults will be essential
to delivering high-quality cancer care.

INTRODUCTION
The aging population—along with improved health
care access and prolonged cancer survivorship—is
expected to intensify the cancer burden of our
nation during the coming decades.1 On the basis of
current projections, the number of older adults
age $ 65 years will double by midcentury, leading to
a nearly 50% increase in the annual cancer inci-
dence.2 By that time, seniors will account for the
majority of US patients with cancer.3 Even now,
more than one half of new cancer cases in the United
States come from this segment of the population.4
Given these epidemiologic trends, cancer will
firmly become a disease of the elderly. Whereas
cure remains an achievable priority, age-related
health concerns can complicate the course of care
for older adults. Functional decline, cognitive dis-
orders, frailty, comorbidities, malnutrition, and
polypharmacy are common within the elderly
population—especially for those with cancer—and
have been associated with worsening morbidity,
toxicity, and intolerance during cancer treatment.5-9
To better meet these patient needs, multiple
organizations have called for greater incorporation of
gerontologic principles into cancer care via practice
guidelines or interdisciplinary care models.10-12

 Recent collaborations between surgical and geriatric societies have also
produced guidelines for the preoperative assessment of elderly adults
and the management of postoperative delirium.13,14 Such initiatives ask
providers and health care systems to devote more time and resources to
screening and managing older adults who are potentially at risk for
adverse events; however, the extent and magnitude of age-related
conditions have not been systematically evaluated on a national level.
In this context, there is an immediate need to better
understand the burden of geriatric events among elderly patients
who undergo major surgery for cancer. Using a national sample, we
examined the presence of dehydration, delirium, falls and frac-
tures, failure to thrive, and pressure ulcers after surgery for the 10
most common solid-organ malignancies in older adults, and
explored the potential association with other patient outcomes. In
doing so, we identify cancer populations in need of a more
integrated, geriatric-based approach to cancer care.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Data Source
To assess the burden of geriatric events during major cancer surgery,
we used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2009 to 2011 as
provided by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project and the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The NIS includes 20% of US
inpatient hospitalizations from nonfederal, community hospitals stratified
by facility bed size, location, control and/or ownership, teaching status, and
region. Abstracted from discharge data, this sample draws from more than
40 states and represents 97% of the US population. The sample also
includes established weights to standardize to the general population as
well as information on patient demographics, hospital characteristics,
discharge diagnoses and procedures, and hospital charges.15 This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of California,
Los Angeles.
Case Selection, Patient Demographics, and Hospital
Characteristics
To focus on the older population, we created a sample consisting of
adults age $ 65 along with a referent group of adults age 55 to 64 years. We
then selected surgical admissions for the 10 most common solid-organ
malignancies in the United States—on the basis of age-specific cancer
incidence rates4—by identifying cases with an International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9) code for cancer
of the bladder, breast, colon and/or rectum, endometrium, kidney, lung,
ovary, pancreas, prostate, or stomach, along with a corresponding pro-
cedure code for surgical resection (Appendix Table A1, online only). In
total, we identified an unweighted cohort of 190,014 patients who
underwent major surgery for treatment of cancer.
On the basis of the information provided in NIS, we identified patient
age, gender, and race/ethnicity for each observation. We assessed pre-
existing comorbidity by using a modification of the Charlson comorbidity
index, socioeconomic position on the basis of median ZIP code income,
and admission acuity (elective v urgent or emergent hospitalization).16,17
In addition, we used established methodology to identify minimally
invasive surgery for patients undergoing nephrectomy, cystectomy, col-
orectal surgery, gastrectomy, lung surgery, prostatectomy, oophorectomy,
or hysterectomy.18,19 We also distinguished organ-sparing techniques for
patients undergoing surgery for cancer of the kidney, bladder, lung,
pancreas, ovary, or stomach. To control for hospital characteristics that can
influence outcomes,20,21 we used hospital-level measures related to bed
size, location, control and/or ownership, teaching status, and region.
Finally, we determined the annual procedure-specific volume for each
hospital, stratified into four equally sized quartiles.
Primary Outcome Measures
To reflect the scope of health concerns pertinent to the geriatric pop-
ulation, we developed a composite measure for geriatric events on the basis of
ICD-9 codes that indicate dehydration (ie, 276.5x), delirium (ie, 290.11, 290.3,
290.41, 291.0, 292.81, 293.0, 293.1, 348.31, 349.82), falls and fractures (ie,
800–829, E880–E888), failure to thrive (ie, 783.2x, 783.7, 260–263), and
pressure ulcers (ie, 707.0x, 707.2x, 707.8, 707.9).22-24 Our claims-based def-
inition focuses on events that tend to be acute, incorporates the AHRQ Patient
Safety Indicators for pressure ulcer and hip fractures, and consists of codes used
previously to examine geriatric conditions in administrative data.22-27
Secondary Outcome Measures
To assess the potential impact of geriatric events, we examined several
additional outcomes: inpatient complications; length of stay; hospitalization
costs; and disposition status. As described previously,28 we drew from the
Complication Screening Program and AHRQ Patient Safety Indicators and
identified inpatient complications by using specific ICD-9 codes for acci-
dental puncture or laceration, acute renal failure, cardiac complications,
gastrointestinal complications, genitourinary complications, neurologic
events, postoperative hemorrhage, postoperative infection (eg, pneumonia
and Clostridium difficile), pulmonary failure, sepsis, venous thromboemb-
olism, wound complications, and miscellaneous complications.23,24,29-31
Because length of stay and expenditures vary by disease, we created indi-
cator variables for hospitalizations in the top deciles of admission length and
cost, the latter of which was estimated from total charges, cost-to-charge
ratios, and adjustment factors as provided by Healthcare Cost and Utilization
Project.32,33 Finally, disposition status was assessed in two ways. First, we
monitored the occurrence of inpatient mortality during the hospital
admission. Second, we determined if a patient expired or transferred to
another facility versus discharged to home.
Statistical Analysis
Applying the appropriate sampling frame and weights, we obtained
national estimates for our composite geriatric measure. Next, we compared
patient demographics and hospital characteristics according to the
occurrence of a geriatric event by using x2 testing. We then examined the
proportion of cases with a geriatric event for each cancer type with respect
to age and age-adjusted comorbidity.
To further investigate the relationship between age and geriatric events,
we fitted multivariable logistic regression models that adjusted for patient
demographics (ie, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and
admission acuity), cancer type, and hospital characteristics (ie, bed size,
location, control and/or ownership, teaching status, region, and procedure
volume). Holding these variables constant, we calculated the predicted
probability of a geriatric event for patients age 55 to 64, 65 to 74, and $ 75.
As some of our geriatric events could reflect pre-existing conditions, we
repeated our analyses for patients who underwent elective surgery and those
without baseline comorbidity. In addition, because such events may be
related to disease severity, we estimated the probability of geriatric events for
patients who underwent minimally invasive and/or organ-sparing surgery,
which tend to be performed for less aggressive malignancies.
Next, as an exploratory analysis, we examined the relationship
between geriatric events and our secondary outcome measures. For each
outcome, we fit multivariable logistic regression models that adjusted for
patient characteristic, cancer type, and hospital factors. We then deter-
mined the model-adjusted probability for each outcome according to
exposure to a geriatric event.
Finally, to gauge the robustness of our findings, we performed several
additional sensitivity analyses. First, we refitted our primary models for each
specific cancer to gauge the consistency of our findings across cancer type.
Second, we examined each component of our primary outcome measure
separately to determine whether the relationships with age and our sec-
ondary outcomes persisted. Third, we fitted multilevel, mixed-effect models
in the unweighted sample given the hierarchical nature of the dataset. Fourth,
given measurable differences between patients with and without a geriatric

 event, we reassessed the relationship between geriatric events and our
secondary outcomes using propensity score weighting. To do so, we weighted
each observation by the inverse probability of a geriatric event, which was
calculated by using logistic regression adjusted for our described covariates.
All statistical testing was two sided and completed using STATA
software (STATA, College Station, TX; Computing Resource Center, Santa
Monica, CA), and carried out at the 5% significance level.
RESULTS
From 2009 to 2011, we identified a weighted sample of 939,150
patients age $ 55 admitted to the hospital for major cancer surgery.
Overall, 9.2% (95% CI, 8.8% to 9.7%) experienced at least one
geriatric event during the inpatient hospitalization. Among those
who experienced a geriatric event, specific conditions occurred as
follows: nutrition-related events (failure to thrive and dehy-
dration), 81.3% (95% CI, 80.2% to 82.3%); delirium, 17.1% (95%
CI, 16.1% to 18.0%); and mobility-related events (pressure ulcers,
falls, and fractures), 9.6% (95% CI, 9.0% to 10.2%). As detailed in
Table 1, these events occurred more often among the very old,
adults with greater comorbidity, and patients who underwent
nonelective procedures (P ,.001). Our aging-related conditions
also seemed to be more common in nonteaching institutions
(P , .001) and lower-volume centers (P , .001).

Geriatric Events During Cancer-Directed Surgery
 As highlighted in Figures 1 and 2, the occurrence of events
varied significantly with cancer site, age, and comorbidity. Patients
who underwent operations for prostate cancer (1.0%; 95% CI,
0.9% to 1.2%), breast cancer (2.0%; 95% CI, 1.8% to 2.2%), or
endometrium cancer (4.2%; 95% CI, 3.7% to 4.7%) had the lowest
proportion of patients with a geriatric event. Patients treated
surgically for kidney cancer (6.2%; 95% CI, 5.7% to 6.7%) or lung
cancer (8.4%; 95% CI, 7.8% to 9.0%) had moderate rates of
geriatric events. Patients who underwent cancer-directed surgery
for the following cancers had the highest proportion of geriatric
events: ovary, 14.4% (95% CI, 12.9% to 15.9%); bladder, 15.3%
(95% CI, 13.5% to 17.3%); colon and/or rectum, 16.6% (95% CI,
16.1% to 17.2%); pancreas, 25.2% (95% CI, 22.9% to 27.7%); and
stomach, 25.5% (95% CI, 23.5% to 27.5%). Across all cancer sites,
patients age $ 75 years and those with high comorbidity were
significantly more likely to experience a geriatric event compared
with their younger or healthier counterparts (P , .05). The
prevalence of geriatric events by type, cancer site, and age is
reported in Appendix Table A2 (online only).
Adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, the pre-
dicted probability of a geriatric event increased substantially with
age strata; elderly patients (ie, age 65 to 74 years) and very elderly
patients (ie, age $ 75 years) encountered a 22.9% and 65.7%
higher probability of a geriatric event, respectively, compared with
patients age 55 to 64 years. Whereas the likelihood of experiencing
an event was lower among elective cases, laparoscopic surgeries,
and patients without comorbidity, the relative probability of a
geriatric event remained substantially higher for patients ages 65 to
74 and $ 75 years (Fig 3).
Finally, these events seem to be associated with other adverse
outcomes. As depicted in Figure 4, patients with a geriatric event
had a nearly two-fold higher probability of a concurrent inpatient
complication compared with those without a geriatric event (odds
ratio [OR], 3.73; 95% CI, 3.55 to 3.92). These events also seemed to
be linked to prolonged hospitalization (OR, 5.47; 95% CI, 5.16 to
5.80) and high cost (OR, 4.97; 95% CI, 4.58 to 5.39). Furthermore,
patients who experienced a geriatric event were less likely to be
discharged to home (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.29) and were
more likely to die during the index hospitalization (OR, 3.22; 95%
CI, 2.94 to 3.53) compared with patients who did not experience
such events. These relationships remained significant across cancer
type, for each specific event, and through our exploratory mixed-
effect and propensity-weighted models.
DISCUSSION
The US population continues to grow older, bringing major change
to the cancer landscape.2,10 In addition to increasing the number of
patients with cancer, the aging population will push to the forefront
a distinctive set of health concerns—those related to frailty,
function, cognitive decline, malnutrition, and other syndromes.
Even now, as defined in this study, these affect approximately one
in 10 patients older than age 54 who undergo cancer surgery in the
United States. With even higher rates observed among the very old
(ie, patients age $ 75 years), the fastest growing segment of the US
population,2 geriatric events during cancer-directed surgery are
likely to become even more prevalent.
In addition to patient age, the risk for geriatric events seems to
be driven by cancer site. Geriatric events occurred in 1.0% to 25.5%
of surgical cases according to cancer location, with the highest
frequency noted for cancers requiring major abdominal surgery.
For these procedures, our estimates seem to be consistent with the
published literature. Our observed rate of falls and fractures and

 pressure ulcers are in line with previous population-based esti-
mates.34 Though failure to thrive and dehydration are reported
infrequently, failure to thrive seems to be a leading reason for
readmission to the hospital.35,36 With respect to delirium, published
rates vary widely, ranging from 5% to 50%, depending on a
multitude of parameters, including patient population, surgical
indication, and performed procedure.14 The relative contribution
from delirium noted here stands slightly below this range, likely as a
result of under-reporting of delirium when using administrative
data.25,37 Even so, the estimated prevalence of delirium is consistent
with previous claims-based assessments and seems higher than that
reported for orthopedic surgery.26 Taken together, geriatric events
seem to be a major category of postoperative morbidity, especially
for those who undergo abdominal cancer surgery.
Irrespective of cancer type, these age-related events seem to
indicate worse surgical outcomes. Patients with dehydration,
delirium, falls and fractures, failure to thrive, or pressure ulcers
have a nearly two-fold greater probability of a concurrent medical
or surgical complication. As observed with other types of
complications,38,39 these events may also escalate resource use

Geriatric Events During Cancer-Directed Surgery
 (ie, hospital and postacute care days) and hospitalization cost.
Although we cannot infer causality (eg, geriatric events could occur
as both an inciting or ensuing incident), specific interventions
aimed at addressing geriatric needs during surgery have demon-
strated reductions in delirium, medical complications, hospital-
ization length, and cost.40-44 Given their associated ramifications,
geriatric events during cancer surgery need to be reduced, espe-
cially as health care systems aim to improve patient outcomes and
curtail the rising cost of cancer care in the United States.10
These results should be considered in the context of several
limitations. First, the use of administrative data to identify these
events relies largely on coding accuracy. To the extent possible, we
used either validated measures or diagnoses codes used previously
in population-based assessments.22-26 These metrics have dem-
onstrated higher levels of accuracy within surgical cohorts and
when applying more current coding algorithms.27,29,31 Second,
although our selected events are typically acute, they may, in some
cases, represent pre-existing conditions rather than postsurgical
events.27,45 However, our sensitivity analyses found similar results
for our healthiest patients and elective cases where these selected
conditions are unlikely to exist at baseline. Even in the event of
misclassification, geriatric conditions present on admission likely
carry similar ramifications for hospital care. Third, given the cross-
sectional nature of our dataset, we are unable to assess longitudinal
outcomes pertinent to the geriatric population, such as rehospi-
talization and functional recovery. It is worth noting, though, that
skilled nursing facility use, which was greater among patients with
a geriatric event, has been linked to an increased number of 30-day
readmissions for patients who underwent major surgery involving
the gastrointestinal tract.35,46 Fourth, and most important, as with
any observational study, our findings remain subject to potential
bias. In particular, the absence of cancer staging may lead to
residual confounding. To offset this limitation, we examined the
likelihood of geriatric events among patients who underwent
laparoscopic and/or organ-sparing surgery—techniques typically
reserved for less aggressive disease. Even within these subgroups,
the likelihood of a geriatric event increased significantly with age,
confirming the robustness of our analyses. As mentioned in the
preceding paragraph, the relationship between geriatric events and
our secondary outcomes may be bidirectional. Though our
findings did not differ when using mixed-effect and propensity-
weighted models, future studies will be needed to clarify the causal
relationship between geriatric events and other clinical outcomes.
These limitations notwithstanding, our findings have impor-
tant implications for surgical cancer care in the context of an aging
population. As highlighted through recent guidelines and proposed
care models,10-14 integrating geriatric care—comprehensive geriatric
assessments, polypharmacy management, physical conditioning,
social support—within oncologic practice may enhance quality by
addressing health concerns that are frequently encountered by
older adults. Whereas geriatric oncology programs or coordinated
care teams with geriatricians may represent the most straight-
forward approach, access to such services may be limited, especially
when considering the limited geriatrics-trained workforce.10,47 As
such, it will be critical to develop core competency in geriatric
medicine for surgical and medical oncologists and other members
of the cancer care team. The Geriatrics-for-Specialists Initiative of
the American Geriatric Society is one ongoing effort that aims to
enhance the uptake and application of geriatric medicine by
surgical and medical specialists.48 Among several milestones, this
initiative has piloted geriatric education programs in select spe-
cialty residency programs.49 Though advanced training in medical
oncology typically offers exposure to similar curricula, embedding
geriatric education in oncology fellowship programs in gynecology,
surgery, and urology may prove especially prudent. Along with
other modalities (eg, practice guidelines and core competency
tested on board certification),50 specialty cancer providers may be
more empowered to care for these high-risk, elderly adults.
Although greater knowledge and comfort with geriatric
concerns remain essential, certain patients with cancer who are at
high risk may benefit from a more integrated, team-based
approach. As highlighted in Figures 1 and 2, as many as one

 third of very old patients who undergo major abdominal surgery
for treatment of cancer experience a geriatric event. For these
patients, comanagement models that actively involve geriatric-
trained providers may increase adherence to evidence-based
care and reduce overall morbidity. Used previously for patients
undergoing orthopedic procedures, these models span the entire
treatment episode, from planning through recovery, and incor-
porate thorough geriatric assessment and tailored perioperative
care from a comanaging geriatrician or internist.42-44 Previous
studies suggest that such approaches can reduce acute geriatric
events as well as other complications and total hospitalization
length.40-44 Future studies in oncology will be critical to under-
stand the role and effectiveness of such care processes in reducing
geriatric events. Until then, building the working knowledge in
geriatrics and selectively applying geriatric-based team care to
high-risk patients may provide the most practical means for
delivering optimal care to older patients who require cancer
surgery.
In conclusion, geriatric events arise regularly after cancer
surgery, especially for the very old and sick and those who require
major abdominal surgery. These events may add to operative
morbidity and resource use, straining both patients and the cancer
care delivery system. Efforts aimed at addressing age-related health
concerns and reducing associated morbidity will be essential as the
number of older adults with cancer continues to grow.
