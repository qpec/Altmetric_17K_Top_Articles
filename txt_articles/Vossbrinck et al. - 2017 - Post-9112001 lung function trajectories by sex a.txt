Abstract
Objective—To determine whether lung function trajectories after 9/11/2001 (9/11) differed by 
sex or race/ethnicity in World Trade Center-exposed Fire Department of the City of New York 
emergency medical service (EMS) workers.
Method—Serial cross-sectional study of pulmonary function tests (PFTs) taken between 9/11 and 
9/10/2015. We used data from routine PFTs (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and FEV1% 
predicted), conducted at 12–18 month intervals. FEV1 and FEV1% predicted were assessed over 
time, stratified by sex, and race/ethnicity. We also assessed FEV1 and FEV1% predicted in current, 
former and never-smokers.
Results—Among 1817 EMS workers, 334 (18.4%) were women, 979 (53.9%) self-identified as 
white and 939 (51.6%) were never-smokers. The median follow-up was 13.1 years (IQR 10.5–
13.6), and the median number of PFTs per person was 11 (IQR 7–13). After large declines 
associated with 9/11, there was no discernible recovery in lung function. In analyses limited to

 never-smokers, the trajectory of decline in adjusted FEV1 and FEV1% predicted was relatively 
parallel for men and women in the 3 racial/ethnic groups. Similarly, small differences in FEV1 
annual decline between groups were not clinically meaningful. Analyses including ever-smokers 
were essentially the same.
Conclusions—14 years after 9/11, most EMS workers continued to demonstrate a lack of lung 
function recovery. The trajectories of lung function decline, however, were parallel by sex and by 
race/ethnicity. These findings support the use of routine, serial measures of lung function over 
time in first responders and demonstrate no sex or racial sensitivity to exposure-related lung 
function decline.
INTRODUCTION
Thousands of Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) firefighters and emergency 
medical service workers (EMS) responded to the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks on or 
after September 11, 2001 (9/11). During the months of rescue and recovery, many were 
exposed to high volumes of aerosolised dust, resulting in a well-described burden of WTC-
related physical and mental health conditions.1–3 Starting before 9/11, the FDNY Bureau of 
Health Services (BHS) included lung function tests as part of its routine monitoring 
examination, recognising their importance in assessment of work fitness, efficacy of 
personal protective equipment and treatment response. Our earlier study of lung function in 
the FDNY cohort found that during the first post-9/11 year, lung function (forced expiratory 
volume in 1 s (FEV1)) decreased substantially in never-smokers, with greater declines in 
firefighters (−439 mL, or ~15 times greater than usual) than EMS (−267 mL or ~9 times 
greater than usual).4 The forced vital capacity (FVC) behaved similarly.4 A recently 
completed 13-year follow-up study that included only firefighters showed a lack of recovery 
in lung function.5
It remains unknown whether the observed lack of recovery in lung function following WTC 
exposure was influenced by sex and race/ethnicity. In the general population, lung volumes 
and their age-related declines are known to differ by sex and race/ethnicity.6 The incidence 
and clinical course of several respiratory diseases are also known to differ by sex and race/
ethnicity.7–10 Further, non-WTC exposures, such as smoking and air pollution, have 
demonstrated a disproportional impact on women, who are at increased risk for reduced lung 
function, obstructive airways disease (OAD) and lung cancer.9–13 Sex hormones may play a 
role as they are associated with the regulation of lung innate immunity and inflammation.14 
For these reasons, federally funded research mandates that sex and race/ethnicity effects be 
examined.15
FDNY firefighters are homogeneous—nearly all white men. FDNY EMS, however, are a 
diverse group, which allows examination of differences in the host response to WTC 
exposure by sex and race. Recently, we reported that in FDNY WTC-exposed EMS, the 
incidence of OAD was higher in women, but similar between whites and non-whites.16 We 
undertook the current study to compare the trajectories of post-9/11 lung function decline in 
this cohort, by sex and race/ethnicity, through the first 14 post-9/11 years.

 METHODS
Study population
Our base population included 2075 FDNY-EMS who were active FDNY employees on 9/11 
or had left FDNY employment, but responded to the WTC attacks within the first 2 weeks 
(9/11–9/24/2001). Study participants gave written informed consent for research, had 
available body weight information (recorded on at ≥50% of monitoring examinations) and 
known smoking status. Owing to small numbers, Asians (n=43) and Native Americans (n=2) 
were excluded. The final population included 1817 (87.6% of base population) EMS. 
Montefiore Medical Center’s institutional review board approved this study.
Spirometric measurements
FEV1 and FVC measurements were obtained from spirometries conducted during the 
FDNY-BHS’s routine monitoring examinations, scheduled every 12–18 months, between 
9/11 and 9/10/2015. The spirometers used during the current study were identical to those 
used in our previous work, as were exclusion criteria (improper scheduling, poor quality or 
physiologically impossible values) for invalid measurements, resulting in the exclusion of 
1173 of 18 638 spirometries (6.3%).45 We used NHANES normative prediction equations to 
calculate FEV1% predicted based on sex, race/ethnicity and height for whites, African-
Americans and Hispanics. FEV1, as an absolute value and as a per cent predicted (FEV1% 
predicted), was the outcome of interest due to the known greater variability of FVC.5
Other measures
Descriptive information (age, sex, race/ethnicity) was obtained from the FDNY employee 
database. Height and weight data were recorded at each monitoring examination. Weight 
was missing from 546 monitoring examinations with concurrent spirometry (3.1%); for 
these examinations, we imputed weight from the time of the closest examination with a non-
missing weight.
Cigarette smoking status (never, former or current) was based on information from 
participants’ most recent monitoring questionnaire. Only those reporting never smoking 
throughout the study period were classified as ‘never-smokers’.
Statistical analysis
Demographic comparisons were made using Pearson’s χ2 test. We assessed FEV1 and 
FEV1% predicted over time in never-smokers (n=939) stratified by sex and race/ethnicity, 
and in current, former and never-smokers stratified by sex. We conducted similar analyses 
using FVC as the outcome (absolute and % predicted). The FEV1 and FEV1% predicted 
findings have different interpretations: The longitudinal FEV1 analyses are comparisons of 
decline rates within-individuals, across the different groups. The longitudinal FEV1% 
predicted analyses assess differences over time in how the NHANES reference population 
compares with our population in FEV1. Owing to the nature of our data (repeated measures 
with significant variability between participants), we used mixed linear models with a 
random intercept and adjusted for age on 9/11 and weight at the time of the spirometry. 
Models with absolute FEV1 as the outcome were adjusted for height. Age was assessed as a

 linear and non-linear effect; however, because there was no discernable difference, age was 
included as a linear effect. All models estimated the weighted average values of each 
outcome in 1-year increments from 9/11 to 9/10/2015. Analyses were performed using SAS 
(V.9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA).
RESULTS
Study population
Three hundred and eighty-eight of the 1817 (21.4%) were African-American and 450 
(24.8%) were Hispanic; 334 (18.4%) were women. While the most common race was white 
(n=979, 53.9%), women were more likely than men to be African-American (27.5% vs 
20.0%, p=0.002). Overall, 51.7% were never-smokers and 12.5% were current-smokers. 
Smoking status differed slightly by sex, as women were less likely than men to report never 
smoking (46.4% vs 52.9%; p=0.033) and by race, as African-Americans were more likely to 
be never-smokers (61.9% vs 46.6% for whites and 54.0% for Hispanics; p<0.001). The 
median number of spirometries per participant was 11 (IQR 7–13) with a median length of 
follow-up 13.1 years (IQR 10.5–13.6); both were similar by sex. Excluded EMS had similar 
characteristics to those included in the final population (data not shown).
After 9/11, there was no discernible recovery in lung function. FEV1 annual decline was 
greatest among current-smokers and lowest among never-smokers, with a difference of 12.5 
mL/year for men and 10.8 mL/year for women between the two smoking statuses.
Among the 939 never-smokers, the trajectories of post-9/11 decline in adjusted FEV1 and 
FEV1% predicted were relatively parallel for men (figure 1, panels 1 and 2) and women 
(figure 1, panels 3 and 4) in the three race/ethnic groups throughout follow-up. African-
Americans had the lowest adjusted FEV1, but the highest FEV1% predicted. The small 
differences among race/ethnic groups in FEV1 annual decline were not clinically 
meaningful. The largest difference in yearly decline was between white and Hispanic men 
(4.1 mL/year) and African-American and Hispanic women (4.9 mL/year). Neither sex nor 
race/ethnicity was associated with recovery. Analyses including former and current-smokers 
were similar, as were results using FVC and FVC% predicted (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
We carried out this study among 1817 WTC-exposed EMS, and believe that we are the first 
to report that the trajectory of post-9/11 lung function decline (FEV1 and FEV1% predicted) 
was similar for WTC-exposed men and women and also did not differ by race/ethnicity. As 
we found in firefighters,5 current-smokers had a greater annual decline than never-smokers. 
Our findings rely on the availability of high-quality, serial lung function measurements, 
which have proven to be an extraordinary resource for understanding the impact of WTC 
exposures on worker health. An important distinction between this WTC-exposed EMS 
cohort and general population studies is that in this cohort, neither sex, race/ethnicity, nor 
smoking status is associated with income, as all EMS were FDNY employees with similar 
pay based on collective bargaining agreements.

 Our study has some limitations. We do not have normative equations that are more specific 
than ‘African-American’; thus, our finding that African-Americans have the lowest adjusted 
FEV1 but the highest FEV1% predicted may be the result of ethnic and/or demographic 
differences between our population and the NHANES reference population. Also, we used 
the ‘Mexican-American’ prediction equations from NHANES as normative values for 
Hispanics, although the proportion of our Hispanic population that identifies as Mexican-
American is unknown. As a result, intra-racial/ethnic differences in FEV1 may be greater 
than inter-racial/ethnic differences. We also acknowledge that the use of these equations to 
adjust for the impact of ‘normal’ ageing on FEV1 is imperfect. Nonetheless, normative 
equations are widely used and we observed similar trajectories when our outcome was actual 
FEV1 rather than FEV1% predicted. Finally, since we modelled annual decline by sex and 
race/ethnicity, some of the data for women were based on relatively small sample sizes, 
which also prevented our examination of decline by smoking status and by race/ethnicity in 
women.
The study strengths outweigh its limitations. Strengths include a relatively large proportion 
of women and non-whitess, all of whom met pre-employment physical requirements; a 
cohort defined prior to 9/11 with analyses limited to lung function data obtained from 
routine monitoring examinations, thereby reducing potential selection bias; and, minimal 
longitudinal dropout over a lengthy post-exposure follow-up, using the same spirometers and 
techniques as we have previously reported.
In conclusion, over 14 years of follow-up, we found a continued lack of lung function 
recovery and trajectories of lung function decline that did not vary by sex or race/ethnicity. 
The public health implications of this study include support for routine serial measures of 
lung function over time in occupational cohorts with significant exposure risks.

 What this paper adds
•
Previous studies of the prevalence of post-9/11 symptoms and diagnoses in 
workers and others have shown differences by sex and by race and ethnicity.
•
None of these studies examined lung function decline over time by these 
demographic characteristics.
•
This study shows that there were no clinically significant differences in lung 
function trajectories by sex or race/ethnicity as a result of exposure to the 
World Trade Center (WTC) disaster.
•
Ongoing surveillance of affected populations remains important in 
understanding the long-term consequences of WTC exposure.
