Nations within a nation: variations in epidemiological 
transition across the states of India, 1990–2016 in the Global 
Burden of Disease Study
India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative Collaborators*
Summary
Background 18% of the world’s population lives in India, and many states of India have populations similar to those of 
large countries. Action to effectively improve population health in India requires availability of reliable and comprehensive 
state-level estimates of disease burden and risk factors over time. Such comprehensive estimates have not been available 
so far for all major diseases and risk factors. Thus, we aimed to estimate the disease burden and risk factors in every state 
of India as part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2016.
Methods Using all available data sources, the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative estimated burden (metrics were 
deaths, disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs], prevalence, incidence, and life expectancy) from 333 disease conditions and 
injuries and 84 risk factors for each state of India from 1990 to 2016 as part of GBD 2016. We divided the states of India 
into four epidemiological transition level (ETL) groups on the basis of the ratio of DALYs from communicable, maternal, 
neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNNDs) to those from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries combined 
in 2016. We assessed variations in the burden of diseases and risk factors between ETL state groups and between states 
to inform a more specific health-system response in the states and for India as a whole.
Findings DALYs due to NCDs and injuries exceeded those due to CMNNDs in 2003 for India, but this transition had a 
range of 24 years for the four ETL state groups. The age-standardised DALY rate dropped by 36·2% in India from 
1990 to 2016. The numbers of DALYs and DALY rates dropped substantially for most CMNNDs between 1990 and 
2016 across all ETL groups, but rates of reduction for CMNNDs were slowest in the low ETL state group. By contrast, 
numbers of DALYs increased substantially for NCDs in all ETL state groups, and increased significantly for injuries 
in all ETL state groups except the highest. The all-age prevalence of most leading NCDs increased substantially in 
India from 1990 to 2016, and a modest decrease was recorded in the age-standardised NCD DALY rates. The major 
risk factors for NCDs, including high systolic blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, high total cholesterol, and 
high body-mass index, increased from 1990 to 2016, with generally higher levels in higher ETL states; ambient air 
pollution also increased and was highest in the low ETL group. The incidence rate of the leading causes of injuries 
also increased from 1990 to 2016. The five leading individual causes of DALYs in India in 2016 were ischaemic heart 
disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, and cerebrovascular 
disease; and the five leading risk factors for DALYs in 2016 were child and maternal malnutrition, air pollution, 
dietary risks, high systolic blood pressure, and high fasting plasma glucose. Behind these broad trends many 
variations existed between the ETL state groups and between states within the ETL groups. Of the ten leading causes 
of disease burden in India in 2016, five causes had at least a five-times difference between the highest and lowest 
state-specific DALY rates for individual causes.
Interpretation Per capita disease burden measured as DALY rate has dropped by about a third in India over the past 
26 years. However, the magnitude and causes of disease burden and the risk factors vary greatly between the states. The 
change to dominance of NCDs and injuries over CMNNDs occurred about a quarter century apart in the four ETL state 
groups. Nevertheless, the burden of some of the leading CMNNDs continues to be very high, especially in the lowest 
ETL states. This comprehensive mapping of inequalities in disease burden and its causes across the states of India can 
be a crucial input for more specific health planning for each state as is envisioned by the Government of India’s premier 
think tank, the National Institution for Transforming India, and the National Health Policy 2017.

Introduction
India has a population of 1·34 billion spread across

have populations of similar sizes to large countries; 
ten states had more than 60 million people in 2017

than 220 million people, ranked fifth largest among all 
nations of the world.2 India has more than 2000 ethnic 
groups with genetically distinct ancestry and diverse 
lifestyles3 and has undergone heterogeneous economic 
growth over the past few decades, which would be 
expected to lead to wide variations in health and disease 
distribution in different parts of the country. The overall 
economic growth rate in India has been one the fastest in 
the world in the past decade.4 This growth should be used 
to enhance major long-term enablers of societal 
development, of which population health is a crucial 
aspect that would further boost economic growth.
Some research has tried to understand the epidemi-
ological transition that India is undergoing,5–9 but a 
comprehensive understanding of the changes in disease 
burden and risk factor trends with large-scale robust data 
for each state of India is not readily available. The social 
development status of the states in India varies widely. 
For example, the state of Kerala has been reported to 
have had much better health indicators than the rest of 
India for the past several decades.10 The Government of 
India focuses more development efforts on the 
Empowered Action Group (EAG) states in north India 
and the states of the northeast region of India, which 
often have poorer health indicators than the rest of 
India.11 Diversity in the magnitude and causes of disease 
burden, as well as the risk factors, is generally anticipated 
between and within the broad state groupings, but no 
systematic and comprehensive analysis of the state-level 
variations for these is available to inform specific state-
level planning. Although the central government policies 
have significant influence on health initiatives across the 
country, health is a state subject in the Indian federal 
structure.12 Of total government spending on health at 
the state level, on average two-thirds is from the state 
budget and one-third from the central budget.13 A robust 
disaggregated understanding of the disease burden and 
risk factors trends in each state of India is essential for 
effective health-system and policy action to improve 
population health.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Existing evidence suggests that India has been going through 
an epidemiological transition with an increase in the 
proportion of disease burden attributable to 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Attempts have been 
made to understand the epidemiological transition of India as 
a whole for its population of 1·3 billion people. The burden 
from major communicable diseases such as diarrhoea, lower 
respiratory infections, and tuberculosis, as well as neonatal 
disorders, continues to be quite high in India relative to other 
countries. State-level estimates of key indicators such as 
neonatal, infant, and under-5 mortality rates are provided by 
the Sample Registration Survey of India annually for the states 
of the country. The Sample Registration Survey has also 
reported causes of death from verbal autopsy for aggregate 
causes by regions of the country. State-level estimates for HIV 
are produced by the National AIDS Control Organization of 
India. The major national surveys, the National Family Health 
Survey, District Level Household Survey, and the Annual 
Health Survey have provided valuable periodic data on key 
health indicators, though mostly related to child and 
reproductive health. Data on the prevalence of diabetes, 
ischaemic heart disease, and their risk factors are increasingly 
being generated for a number of states by several studies. 
However, a comprehensive assessment of all major diseases 
and risk factors across all states of India providing estimates 
over an extended period of time, which is needed for an 
informed health-system and policy development in each 
state, has not previously been published to our knowledge.
Added value of this study
For the first time to our knowledge, this study provides estimates 
of 333 disease conditions and injuries and 84 risk factors for 
every state of India from 1990 to 2016, using all available data 
identified through an extensive effort involving over 200 leading 
health scientists and policy makers in India from 103 institutions. 
The generation of estimates and their interpretation have 
benefited from the insights of domain experts through an 
intensive collaborative process over 2 years. The findings from 
this study have enabled a comprehensive mapping of the 
epidemiological transition in each state of India, which has 
revealed that grouping the states into four groups by different 
epidemiological transition levels is a useful intermediate step in 
understanding disease burden and risk factor trends across the 
country. The specific state-level findings presented to some 
extent in this paper, and in more detail with a profile of each 
state in the policy report being presented to the Government of 
India and the state governments, are crucial valuable additions 
to state-specific health policy making in India.
Implications of all the available evidence
The evidence now explicitly describes the extent of 
epidemiological transition, burden of broad disease groups and 
specific diseases, and risk factors in each state of India and in the 
four state groups by epidemiological transition level. Although 
the burden due to NCDs and injuries as a whole has overtaken the 
burden due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional 
disorders (CMNNDs) in every state of the country, the extent of 
this varies widely. Accordingly, the enhancement of interventions 
to control NCDs and injuries must happen in every state of the 
country, but, in parallel to this, the burden of CMNNDs has to be 
addressed with vigour, commensurate with its magnitude in each 
state. This specific titration of health policy will be key to achieving 
an appropriate balance of interventions needed to reduce the vast 
inequalities in health status among the states of India.

The India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative was 
launched in October, 2015, to address this crucial gap 
that hinders informed health-system and policy develop-
ment commensurate with the state-level vari 
ations in 
diseases and risk factors. This initiative is a collaboration 
involving 103 institutions with the aim of producing 
robust state-level disease burden trends from 1990 
onward as part of the Global Burden of Disease Study 
(GBD), using all identifiable epidemiological data from 
India and the expertise of a large number of leading 
health scientists and thinkers in India. More information 
on this initiative is provided in the appendix (p 4). This 
effort is consistent with the recent inclusion of disease 
burden tracking using disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) as a specific objective in the India National 
Health Policy 2017, and the emphasis by the National 
Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog; the 
premier thinktank of the Government of India) on 
developing robust systems for disaggregated data to 
inform policy, indicating high-level policy interest in 
using reliable disease burden estimation to guide 
improvements in population health.14–17
In this paper we report findings from the first compre-
hensive assessment by the India State-Level Disease 
Burden Initiative produced as part of GBD 2016, 
highlighting that the country is in different phases of 
epidemiological transition, which have resulted in massive 
variations in disease burden across the Indian states. This 
has fundamental implications for state-specific health-
system and policy efforts to improve the health of the 18% 
of the world’s population that lives in India.
Methods
Overview
The network of the India State-Level Disease Burden 
Initiative collaborators worked closely on the data sources, 
analyses, and interpretation of the findings for the 
calculation of state-level disease burden and risk factor 
estimates as part of GBD 2016. This collaborative work 
benefitted immensely from the deliberations of the 
14 expert groups formed under the India State-Level 
Disease Burden Initiative. The work of this initiative is 
approved by the Health Ministry Screening Committee of 
the Indian Council of Medical Research, and by the ethics 
committee of the Public Health Foundation of India.
A comprehensive description of data sources, data 
quality, statistical modelling and analyses, and metrics for 
GBD 2016 have been reported elsewhere.18–22 GBD 2016 
estimated disease burden due to 333 diseases and injuries 
(appendix pp 5–11) and 84 risk factors (appendix pp 12–13). 
The GBD cause list is hierarchical and includes three 
broad categories at the top level: communicable, maternal, 
neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNNDs); non-
communicable diseases (NCDs); and injuries.19,21
The findings in this paper are presented for 
31 geographical units in India: 29 states, Union Territory 
of Delhi, and the union territories other than Delhi 
(combining the six smaller union territories of Andaman 
and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar 
Haveli, Daman and Diu, Lakshadweep, and Puducherry). 
The states of Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, and Jharkhand 
were created from existing larger states in 2000, and the 
state of Telangana was created in 2014. For trends from 
1990 onward, the data for these four new states were 
disaggregated from their parent states on the basis of 
data from the districts that now constitute these states.
Mortality, causes of death, and YLLs
The estimation process of all-cause mortality includes 
estimation of under-5 mortality, adult mortality, age–
sex mortality estimation, adjustment for HIV
/AIDS 
mortality, and the effects of fatal discontinuities such as 
wars, disasters, and pandemics. Life expectancy was 
computed at birth and at each age category for India and 
for states by age, sex, and time period. The major data 
sources for estimation of mortality in India include 
sample registration system (SRS) and vital registration, 
censuses, and large-scale national household surveys 
such as the National Family Health Surveys and District 
Level Household Surveys (appendix pp 14–121).
Causes of death were estimated on the basis of the 
GBD cause list using Cause of Death Ensemble model 
(CODEm), negative binomial models for rare causes, 
natural history models, subcause proportion models, and 
prevalence-based models. To generate the cause-of-death 
estimates, the completeness of death records was 
assessed by dividing registered deaths in each location–
year by all-age death estimates and using statistical 
models. We mapped revisions of the International 
Classification of Diseases into a consistent classification 
for causes of deaths, and redistributed deaths assigned to 
causes that were not underlying causes of death (garbage 
codes) to specific underlying causes proportionately or 
using regression models. The sum of the predicted 
deaths from these models in an age-sex-state-year group 
do not necessarily equal the number of deaths from all 
causes in the mortality envelopes, and hence we made 
these consistent with the results from all-cause mortality 
estimation using the CoDCorrect algorithm.19 The data 
sources used for the causes of deaths estimation in India 
were verbal autopsy from SRS, Medically Certified 
Causes of Deaths, cancer registries, and smaller verbal 
autopsy studies (appendix pp 14–121). We obtained the 
years of life lost (YLLs) because of premature death by 
multiplying each death by the normative standard life 
expectancy at each age.19
The verbal autopsy cause of death data for 455 460 deaths 
covered by SRS from 2004 to 2013 across all states and 
union territories of India was a major additional data 
source for GBD 2016. The SRS in India is operated by 
the Office of the Registrar General of India working 
under the Ministry of Home Affairs, Govern 
ment of 
India.23 Using the 2001 census, 7597 geographic units, 
4433 (58·4%) of which were rural, were sampled for the

2004–13 SRS to represent the population of each state 
and union territory of India, ultimately with a sample of 
6·7 million people that was equivalent to 0·7% of India’s 
population. The SRS cause-of-death data for 2004–06, 
2007–09, and 2010–13 were provided for each state and 
union territory by the Office of the Registrar General of 
India for use in the state-level disease burden estimation. 
We used 2005, 2008, and 2012 as midpoint years for these 
three time periods. The inclusion of SRS 2004–13 data in 
this analysis offers a comprehensive picture of causes of 
death in India. The Office of the Registrar General of 
India was not involved with the production of the GBD 
modelled estimates, and therefore their estimates might 
differ from those presented here.
YLDs and DALYs
We estimated non-fatal health outcomes mostly 
using DisMod-MR, version 2.1, an updated Bayesian-
regression analytic tool, to synthesise con 
sistent estimates 
of disease incidence, prevalence, remission, excess 
mortality, and cause-specific mortality rates. Details of 
this and other estimation methods, severity distributions 
and disability weights, which are used to quantify the 
relative severity of GBD causes, including the sources 
used for India, are published elsewhere.20
The major input data sources used to quantify the non-
fatal burden of disease in India were representative 
population-level surveys and cohort studies, pro-
gramme-level data on disease burden from government 
agencies, surveillance system data on disease burden, 
administrative records of health-service encounters, 
disease registries, and a wide range of other studies done 
across India (appendix pp 14–121). These studies included 
published literature as well as unpublished studies that 
were identified and accessed through a network of expert 
group members and collaborators in India.
Years lived with disability (YLDs) are calculated by 
multiplying the prevalence of each sequela by its disability 
weight, developed using population-based surveys.20 The 
computation of YLDs involved the estimation of prevalence 
of disease, injuries, and their sequelae. To compute 
YLDs for the particular sequela, the prevalence of each 
sequela was multiplied by the disability weight for the 
corresponding health state.20 The sum of all YLDs for 
relevant sequelae equated to overall YLDs for each disease, 
because sequelae in GBD are mutually exclusive and 
collectively exhaustive. We computed DALYs for India and 
states by summing YLLs and YLDs for each cause, age, 
and sex. For some causes that had reduction in DALY rates 
over time, we also assessed the change in their prevalence 
or incidence rates over time to understand whether the 
lower DALY rates were due to improving health care or 
decreases in these prevalence or incidence rates.
Risk factors
A detailed description of comparative risk assessment for 
exposures and estimation of attributable risks and the 
GBD 2016 risk factor hierarchy is available elsewhere.22 
To calculate risk-attributable fractions of disease burden 
by cause, we modelled the effects of risk exposure levels, 
documented relative risks associated with risk exposure 
and specific health outcomes, and computed theoretical 
minimum risk counterfactual levels of risk exposure on 
estimates for India and state-level deaths, YLLs, YLDs, 
and DALYs.
The input data sources for the estimation of risk factors 
in India include large-scale national household surveys, 
population-level surveys provided by collaborators, 
programme-level data from government agencies, and 
systematic reviews of epidemiological studies (appendix 
pp 14–121). These sources provided empirical estimates of 
risk factor exposure with incorporation of relevant 
predictive covariates in statistical models to obtain a 
summary measure of exposure for each risk, called the 
summary exposure value (SEV). This metric captures 
risk-weighted exposure for a population, or risk-weighted 
prevalence of an exposure, the details of which are 
described elsewhere.22 The scale for SEV spans from 
0% to 100%, with an SEV of 0% reflecting no risk 
exposure in a population and 100% showing that an 
entire population is exposed to the maximum possible 
risk. We then combined the estimates for SEV with 
relative risk estimation for health outcomes with 
sufficient evidence of a causal relationship to provide 
estimates of population attributable fractions of disease 
caused by each risk factor.
All estimates in GBD are strengthened by using 
covariates that are associated with the variable being 
estimated. This is particularly useful when data for a 
variable are scarce.
Grouping of states
We grouped the states of India according to their 
epidemiological transition level (ETL) in 2016, which was 
defined as the ratio of all-age DALYs due to CMNNDs 
versus those due to NCDs and injuries together. A smaller 
ratio indicates advancing epidemiological transition—ie, 
higher burden of NCDs and injuries than CMNNDs. The 
states with ratios of 0·56–0·75 in 2016 were considered 
to have low ETLs (Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, 
Rajasthan, Meghalaya, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Madhya 
Pradesh, and Odisha; total population 626 million 
in 2016), those with ratios of 0·41–0·55 had lower-
middle ETLs (Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, 
Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Tripura, Sikkim, and Manipur; 
total population 92 million), those with ratios of 0·31–0·40 
had higher-middle ETLs (Haryana, Delhi, Telangana, 
Andhra Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, West 
Bengal, Maharashtra, and union territories other than 
Delhi; total population 446 million), and those with ratios 
less than 0·31 had high ETLs (Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, 
Tamil Nadu, Goa, and Kerala; total population 152 million). 
Kerala had the lowest ratio of 0·16. The highest ETL 
group could have been split into two groups, with Kerala 
 Articles

2441
and Goa in one group and the other three states in the 
other groups, but this would have led to very small 
groups. We preferred state groups with at least five states, 
because describing very small groups of states would not 
be very different from describing individual states. The 
ranges of ratios that we used to define the ETL groups 
varied, with a range of 0·2 (0·56–0·75 inclusive) for low 
ETL, 0·15 (0·41–0·55 inclusive) for lower-middle ETL, 
and 0·1 (0·31–0·40 inclusive) for higher-middle ETL. The 
logic for this is that as the ratio increases towards 1, 
a larger range captures similar levels of CMNNDs. 
A combination of this logic and breaks in between 
clusters of ratios were used to define the ETL groups.
We present in this paper trends of epidemiological 
transition, deaths, DALYs, YLLs, YLDs, prevalence, 
incidence, risk factors, and life expectancy for the Indian 
states from 1990 to 2016, highlighting major variations 
between ETL state groups and states, which are relevant 
to inform more nuanced health-system and policy 
development across the states of India.
We related the epidemiological transition ratios across 
the states with their Socio-Demographic Index (SDI), 
which is based on an equal weighting of lag-distributed 
income per capita, average years of education in the 
population older than 15 years, and total fertility rate.19 
We present results as all-age rates to show the disease or 
risk factor burden that the states have to deal with in 
reality at any given time, as well as age-standardised rates 
using a global population reference age structure to 
assess epidemiological differences after adjusting for 
differences in population age structure.
GBD computes 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) around 
estimates. We assessed whether the DALY estimates for 
the causes and risk factors for each state were significantly 
different from the national mean, using 95% UIs based 
on 1000 draws.

Results
All states of India had epidemiological transition ratios 
of 0·75 or less in 2016 (figure 1). By contrast, in 1990, only 
Kerala (ETL 0·49) had a ratio of 0·75 or less, Goa (0·84) 
and the union territories other than Delhi (0·85) had 
ratios 0·76–1·00 and all other states had ratios of one or 
more, showing a major shift across all states between 
1990 and 2016. The percent reduction of epidemiological 
transition ratios ranged from 55·2% to 75·4% across the 
states of India (appendix p 122). The year in which the 
epidemiological transition ratio dropped to less than 1—
and thus, the point at which NCDs and injuries accounted 
for more DALYs than CMNNDs—was 1986 for the high 
ETL state group, 1996 for the higher-middle ETL state 
group, 2000 for the lower-middle ETL state group, 
and 2010 for the low ETL state group, showing a 
24-year variation across the groups; this epidemiological 
transition year for India as a whole was 2003 (figure 2). 
A significant inverse relationship existed between the 
epidemiological transition ratio and the SDI of the 
states, with a correlation coefficient of –5·82 in 1990 and 
–1·81 in 2016. This shows that the relationship between 
SDI and epidemiological transition ratio was stronger in 
1990 than in 2016 (appendix p 130).
In 2016, deaths due to CMNNDs were 34·7% (95% UI 
31·9–39·7) and those due to NCDs were 55·2% 
(50·6–58·1) of the total number of deaths in the low 
ETL group, and 15·9% (13·9–19·3) and 72·3% 
(68·9–74·2) in the high ETL state group (table 1). For 
India as a whole, 27·5% (95% UI 25·4–31·5) of deaths 
were due to CMNNDs, 61·8% (58·2–64·0) due to NCDs, 
and 10·7% (9·6–11·2) due to injuries in 2016 (table 2). 
For the disease categories within CMNNDs, the 
proportional contribution to deaths decreased from the 
lowest to the highest ETL groups. In the NCD categories, 
the proportion of deaths due to cardiovascular diseases 
was highest in the high ETL state group and lowest in 
the low ETL group, but deaths due to chronic respiratory 
diseases were highest in the low ETL group and lowest 
in the high ETL group. The proportion of total deaths in 
the 0–14 years age group was highest in the low ETL 
state group (14·2%) and lowest in the high ETL state 
group (4·1%). In this age group, CMNNDs were 
responsible for the majority of deaths, contributing 
to 82·5% (95% UI 80·3–84·5) in the low and 72·1% 
(68·2–76·6) in the high ETL state groups. The 
proportion of deaths due to injuries was highest in the 
15–39 years age group, with 33·6% (95% UI 31·1–35·3) 
in the low ETL state group and 43·0% (39·6–45·1) in 
the high ETL state group. The proportion of deaths due 
to cardiovascular diseases was similar between the 
40–69 years and 70 years or older age groups, but, when 
comparing these two age groups, the proportion of 
deaths due to neoplasms was higher in the 40–69 years 
age group, whereas the proportion of deaths due to 
chronic respiratory diseases was higher in the 70 years 
or older age group; this trend was similar across the 
ETL state groups.
Of the top ten individual causes of death in India in 
2016, deaths due to all NCD causes increased between 
1990 and 2016; the all-age death rate increased 
significantly for ischaemic heart disease (percentage 
change 54·5% [95% UI 44·1 to 66·4%]), diabetes 
(130·8% [111·1 to 150·4%]), and chronic kidney disease 
(32·7% [18·4 to 49·3%]); and the age-standardised 
death rate increased for ischaemic heart disease (12·0%

[4·5 to 21·3%]) and diabetes (63·7% [48·1 to 79·1%]), but 
decreased for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD; –40·2% [–47·4 to –28·2%]) and cerebrovascular 
disease (–23·7% [–31·2 to –15·3%]; appendix p 131). Of 
the leading injury causes, number of deaths increased 
from road injuries and self-harm (suicide), the all-age 
and age-standardised death rates increased for road 
injuries, and the age-standardised death rate decreased 
for self-harm between 1990 and 2016. The deaths and the 
all-age and age-standardised death rates decreased 
significantly for the leading CMNND causes of death 
such as diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, 
and tuberculosis.
The all-age and age-standardised death rates reduced 
significantly in India from 1990 to 2016, with a greater 
reduction in women than that in men (appendix p 132). 
The reduction in all-age death rates was highest in the low 
ETL state group (–32·8% [95% UI –36·2 to –29·4]) and 
lowest in the high ETL state group (–14% [–20·6 to –6·9]), 
but the reduction in age-standardised death rates was 
similar across the ETL groups. The ratio of the highest to 
lowest was 1·9 for all-age death rates and 2·0 for age-
standardised death rates between the states in 2016; this 
ratio was higher for women than for men.
The low ETL state group had 39·9% (95% UI 
37·7 to 42·7) of the total DALYs from CMNNDs, 
49% (46·4 to 51·0) from NCDs and 11·1% (10·2 to 11·9) 
from injuries in 2016, and the high ETL state group had 
19·5% (18·0 to 21·3), 67·4% (65·5 to 68·9) and 13·1% 
(11·8 to 14·1) DALYs, respectively (appendix p 124). The 
number of DALYs due to NCDs increased by 36·4% 
(28·5 to 45·8) in the high ETL state group from 
1990 to 2016, whereas the number increased by 55·0% 
(47·6 to 62·1) in the higher-middle ETL group, 
68·5% (58·2 to 79·5) in the lower-middle group, and 
64·9% (55·3 to 76·1) in the low group (appendix p 125). 
The all-age DALY rates due to NCDs remained almost 
the same across all ETL state groups over this period, 
but the age-standardised rates decreased significantly in 
all four ETL groups, with a minimum decrease of 9·4% 
(95% UI 14·2 to 4·0) in the low ETL state group and a 
maximum decrease of 17·3% (21·8 to 12·0) in the high 
ETL state group. The number of DALYs due to injuries 
increased significantly from 1990 to 2016 in the lowest 
(29·5% [95% UI 18·0 to 45·5]), lower-middle (36·6% 
[23·9 to 51·3]), and higher-middle (13·5% [4·4 to 23·8]) 
ETL state groups, but the change in the high ETL group 
was not significant –0·2 (–9·9 to 10·1). However, 
both the all-age and age-standardised DALY rates 
due to injuries significantly decreased across all

Figure 1: Epidemiological transition ratios of the states of India
(A) 1990 and (B) 2016. The states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Telangana, and 
Uttarakhand did not exist in 1990, as they were created from existing larger 
states in 2000 or later. Data for these four new states were disaggregated from 
their parent states based on their current district composition. These states are 
shown in the 1990 map for comparison with 2016.

56·2% [60·1 to 51·9] in the lower-middle ETL group, 
maximum decrease 62·1% [66·7 to 57·2] in the high 
ETL group).
The disease categories causing 5% or more of total 
DALYs in India in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases 
(14·1% [95% UI 12·9–15·3]), diarrhoea, lower respiratory 
and 
other 
common 
infectious 
diseases 
(12·7% 
[11·1–15·0]), neonatal disorders (7·9% [7·2–8·8]), chronic 
respiratory diseases (6·4% [5·8–7·0)), diabetes, uro-
genital, and endocrine diseases (5·6% [5·2–6·0]), mental 
and substance abuse disorders (5·6% [4·5–6·7]), 
unintentional injuries (5·4% [4·7–5·8]), and neoplasms 
(5% [4·6–5·5]; appendix p 124). The contribution of most 
CMNNDs to the proportion of DALYs decreased, and that 
of most NCDs and injuries increased from 1990 to 2016 
across all ETL state groups.
The top five individual causes of disease burden in 
India in 1990 were CMNNDs, whereas in 2016, three 
of the top five causes were NCDs, showing a shift 
toward NCDs (figure 3). The number of DALYs due to 
most NCDs increased from 1990 to 2016. Of the 
individual NCDs that are in the top 30 leading causes of 
DALYs in 2016, the increase in all-age DALY rate between 
1990 and 2016 was highest for diabetes (80·0% [95% UI 
71·6–88·5]), ischaemic heart disease (33·9% [24·7–43·6]), 
and sense organ diseases (mainly vision and hearing loss 
disorders; 21·7% [20·1–23·3]); the rates for low back and 
neck pain, migraine, other musculoskeletal disorders, 
chronic kidney disease, depressive disorders, and anxiety 
disorders were also significantly increased (figure 3). The 
age-standardised DALY rate increased significantly only 
for diabetes (39·6% [95% UI 32·1–46·7]) and skin 
diseases (5·3% [2·1–8·6]). Number of DALYs for COPD 
increased significantly by 36·3% (95% UI 21·1–56·8) 
and cerebrovascular disease by 52·9% (40·4–66·7); 
however, their all-age DALY rates did not change 
significantly and their age-standardised DALY rates 
decreased significantly. DALYs due to each of the three 
leading causes of injury in India increased from 
1990 to 2016 (road injuries 65·1% [95% UI 53·4 to 76·6], 
falls 41·3% [17·4 to 59·5], and self-harm 29·8% 
[15·2 to 52·4]), the all-age DALY rate increased sig-
nificantly for road injuries (8·3% [0·7 to 15·9]), and the 
age-standardised DALY rates decreased significantly for 
self-harm (–19·5% [–28·2 to –5·7) and falls (–12·6% 
[–25·1 to –4·2]). The number, all-age rates, and age-
standardised rates of all CMNNDs in the leading 
30 causes in 1990 decreased substantially by 2016, except 
for iron-deficiency anaemia, for which the number of 
DALYs increased by 41·8% (95% UI 39·9–43·8), and the 
all-age DALY rate decreased by 6·9% with no significant 
change in age-standardised rate. In 2016, road injuries 
and self-harm were among the top ten causes of DALYs 
for men, whereas no injury cause was in the top ten for 
women (appendix pp 132–133). Iron-deficiency anaemia, 
migraine, and low back and neck pain were among the 
top ten causes of DALYs for women, but not for men.

Table 2: Percentage contribution of disease categories to total deaths by age groups for all of India, 2016

The all-age prevalence increased from 1990 to 2016 for 
most of the leading NCD causes of DALYs, but the 
age-standardised prevalence increased only for ischaemic 
heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes and skin 
diseases, whereas all other causes remained unchanged 
or had minor decreases (appendix p 126). The percent 
increase in prevalence was more than or similar to the 
percent change in the DALY rates for most of the leading 
NCDs. Similarly, among the leading causes of injuries, 
the percent increases in the incidence rate of road 
injuries were much higher than the percent increase in 
DALY rates; for self-harm and falls the DALY rates 
decreased whereas the incidence did not change 
markedly.
The DALY rates were not consistent across the state 
ETL groups for individual NCDs and injuries (figure 4; 
appendix p 134). Compared with the other ETL state 
groups, the all-age DALY rates for ischaemic heart 
disease, diabetes, sense organ disease, self-harm, low 
back and neck pain, migraine, falls, other musculo-
skeletal disorders, chronic kidney disease, depressive 
disorders, and anxiety disorders were highest in the 
high ETL state group; and the rates for COPD, asthma, 
congenital defects, rheumatic heart disease, and 
drowning were higher in the low ETL state group. The 
ETL group with the highest DALY rate for cerebrovascular 
disease was the higher-middle ETL group, but the 
individual states with the highest DALY rates were spread 
over the low, lower-middle, and higher-middle ETL 
groups (figure 4). Some variations were recorded within 
the ETL state groups: within the high ETL state group, 
all-age DALY rates were about two-times higher for 
ischaemic heart disease in Punjab and Tamil Nadu than 
in Himachal Pradesh, and within the low ETL state 
group, rates of COPD were markedly higher in Rajasthan 
and Uttar Pradesh than other states. The all-age DALY 
rates for the leading CMNNDs were generally highest in 
the low ETL state group, with substantial variations 
between individual states within ETL groups. For 
example, in the low ETL state group, Odisha and 
Jharkhand had the highest DALY rates for diarrhoeal 
diseases but had some of the lowest rates for lower 
respiratory infections. The range of all-age DALY rates 
across the states was wide for many of the leading causes, 
and the highest state-specific rate was more than five 
times the lowest state-specific rate for five of the 
top ten causes in 2016 (appendix p 135).
The ratio of the observed versus expected DALY rate 
based on SDI were assessed (appendix p 127). The 
highest ratios for ischaemic heart disease, diabetes, and

Causes are connected by lines between time periods. Three measures of change are shown: percent change in the number of DALYs, percent change in all-age DALY 
rate and percent change in age-standardised DALY rate. COPD=chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. DALY=disability-adjusted life-year.

chronic kidney disease were in the high ETL state group, 
and the highest ratios for COPD and asthma were in the 
low ETL state group, similar to the trends of DALY rates 
of these diseases across the ETL groups (figure 4). By 
contrast, the highest ratio of the observed versus expected 
DALY rate for diarrhoeal diseases and iron-deficiency 
anaemia was in the high ETL state group, whereas the 
DALY rates for these were the lowest in the high ETL 
state group. For India as a whole, the ratios of the 
observed versus expected DALY rates were 2·10–3·00 for 
COPD, diarrhoeal diseases, iron-deficiency anaemia, 
other neonatal disorders and rheumatic heart disease; 
3·61 for tuberculosis and 4·19 for HIV
/AIDS; and 61·75 
for intestinal infectious diseases (mainly typhoid and 
paratyphoid fevers; appendix p 127).
DALY rates reduced significantly in India by 43·1% 
(95% UI 45·9–40·3; all-age rate) and 36·2% (38·6–33·8; 
age-standardised rate) from 1990 to 2016 (appendix 
p 128). The reductions were slightly greater for women 
than for men. The ratio of the all-age DALY rate in the 
low ETL to the high ETL state group dropped from 1·48 
in 1990 to 1·20 in 2016, but this ratio did not change 
much for age-standardised DALY rates. The highest 
age-standardised DALY rate of an individual state in 2016 
was 1·8 times the lowest.
We assessed DALY burden in India in 2016 by age 
group, taking into account the proportion of the total 
population that each age group contributes. The age 
groups of younger than 5 years and 45 years or older all 
had a higher proportion of the total DALY burden 
relative to their proportion of the population (ratio >1; 
figure 5). The younger than 5 years group had 17·6% of 
the DALYs and constituted 8·5% of the population, a 
ratio of 2·1, which was an improvement from a ratio of 
3·6 in 1990 (appendix p 136). This ratio of DALYs to 
population in 2016 increased from 1·1 in the 45–49 years 
group to 2·1 in the 60–64 years group, and further to 
4·5 in the 85 years and older group. The highest 
proportion of DALYs attributed to CMNNDs were in 
children younger than 5 years (83·4%), and the lowest

was in the 50–54 year age group (14·7%). The proportion 
of DALYs due to NCDs exceeded 50% in the 30–34 years 
group and was highest at 78·8% in the 65–69 years 
group. The proportion of total DALYs due to injuries was 
highest in the age groups from 15 years to 39 years 
(range 18·3–28·1%).
Of the total DALYs in India, 67·2% were YLLs and 
32·8% were YLDs in 2016, whereas 82·5% were YLLs 
and 17·5% were YLDs in 1990 (appendix p 137). In 2016, 
the YLD proportion increased with ETL, from 29·6% in 
the low group to 39·1% in the high ETL state group. 
Among the leading 30 disease burden causes in India 
in 2016, sense organ diseases, low back and neck pain, 
migraine, depressive disorders, and anxiety disorders 
contributed only YLDs; and iron-deficiency anaemia, 
skin diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, and protein-
energy malnutrition contributed more YLDs than YLLs 
(appendix p 138). The leading causes of YLDs were 
quite different from the leading causes of YLLs. Low 
back and neck pain, migraine, skin diseases, depressive 
disorders, other musculoskeletal disorders, diabetes, 
and anxiety disorders featured in the top ten causes of 
YLDs, but not in the top ten causes of DALYs. Migraine, 
depressive disorders, and anxiety disorders had a 
higher YLD ranking among women than men (data 
not shown).
The leading risk factors in India in 2016 responsible 
for more than 5% of the total DALYs each were child 
and maternal malnutrition (undernutrition; 14·6%), 
air pollution (9·8%), dietary risks (unhealthy diet; 
8·9%), high systolic blood pressure (8·5%), high 
fasting plasma glucose (6%), and tobacco use (includes 
smoking, second-hand smoke, and smokeless tobacco; 
5·9%; figure 6). Child and maternal malnutrition 
consisted of child growth failure (underweight, wasting, 
and stunting), low birthweight and short gestation, 
suboptimal breastfeeding, iron-deficiency anaemia, 
vitamin A deficiency, and zinc deficiency. Dietary risks 
comprised of ten components that are protective such 
as low fruit, low vegetables, low whole grains, and low 
nuts and seeds, and five components that are harmful 
such as high sodium, high trans-fats and high red 
meat. Dietary risks, systolic blood pressure, high total 
cholesterol, tobacco, and alcohol and drug use 
contributed more to the DALYs in men than in women, 
whereas child and maternal malnutrition and unsafe 
water, sanitation, and handwashing contributed more 
in women than in men. The proportion of total DALYs 
due to child and maternal malnutrition and unsafe 
water sanitation and handwashing were much higher 
in the low than in the high ETL state group (appendix 
p 139). The proportion for air pollution was also higher 
in the low than in the high ETL state group. Conversely, 
the proportion of total DALYs due to dietary risks, high 
systolic blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, 
high cholesterol, and high body-mass index were 
highest in the high ETL state group.
The all-age DALY rate due to child and maternal 
malnutrition increased with decreasing ETL, with a rate 
three-times higher in the low ETL group than in the high 
ETL state group (figure 7). The DALY rate due to unsafe 
water sanitation and handwashing was 3·4-times higher

in the low than in the high ETL state group. The DALY 
rate due to air pollution was also highest in the low ETL 
state group. In the low ETL group, the DALY rate due to 
outdoor ambient air pollution was 1·5-times higher and 
the rate due to household air pollution was 2·6-times 
higher than the high ETL state group. By contrast, the 
DALY rates due to dietary risks, high systolic blood 
pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, high total 
cholesterol, high body-mass index, and impaired kidney 
function were higher in the high ETL state group, with 
ratios of 1·7–2·6 between the rates in the high versus low 
ETL groups. The DALY rate due to tobacco was lower in 
the high ETL state group than in the other ETL groups. 
Some significant variations were recorded within a group 
between the states. For example, within the high ETL 
state group, Himachal Pradesh had much lower DALY 
rates due to dietary risks, high systolic blood pressure, 
high fasting plasma glucose, high total cholesterol, high

body-mass index, and impaired kidney function than 
most of the other states, and Goa too had a significantly 
lower DALY rate due to dietary risks than most of the 
other states. Age-standardised DALY rates due to each 
risk factor in the states of India are shown in the 
appendix (p 140).
Child and maternal malnutrition mainly contributed to 
DALYs from neonatal disorders, nutritional deficiencies, 
and diarrhoea, lower respiratory, and other common 
infectious diseases (figure 6). These DALYs decreased by 
64·3% (95% UI 67·8–60·1) from 1990 to 2016, but child 
and maternal malnutrition was still the top risk factor, 
causing the highest disease burden in India in 2016 as it 
was in 1990, when it caused 35·5% of the DALYs 
(figure 8). For individual risks under child and maternal 
malnutrition, the SEV of child wasting decreased by 
27·2% (30·3–24·4) from 1990 to 2016 in India (table 3). 
The SEVs of related individual risks also decreased, for 
child stunting by 32·7% (95% UI 29·6–36·6) and child 
underweight by 43·4% (40·0–47·0) from 1990 to 2016 in 
India (data not shown because their contributions to total 
DALYs were <2%). The smallest decrease was in the low 
ETL state group for child stunting, and the greatest 
decrease was in the low ETL group for child wasting. 
Negligible changes were noted in the SEVs of short 
gestation, low birthweight, and iron deficiency between 
1990 and 2016 across all of the ETL state groups.
Unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing contributed 
to DALYs from diarrhoeal diseases and other infections 
(figure 6). These types of DALYs decreased by 69·0% 
(95% UI 74·9–60·9) from 1990 to 2016, with their ranking 
changing from second to seventh leading cause of DALYs 
(figure 8). The SEV of unsafe sanitation decreased by 
43·5% (95% UI 46·2–40·6) and that of unsafe water 
source decreased by 16·9% (20·1–13·7) from 1990 to 2016 
in India (table 3); the smallest decreases were in the low 
ETL state group for both risk factors.
Air pollution mainly contributed to disease burden 
from cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, 
and lower respiratory infections (figure 6). DALYs due to 
air pollution decreased by 23·6% (95% UI 30·8–14·3) in 
India from 1990 to 2016, mainly due to reduction in 
household air pollution (figure 8). The SEV of ambient 
air pollution increased by 16·6% in India during this 
period, with increases in all ETL state groups except the 
high ETL group (table 3). The SEV of household air 
pollution decreased by 40% (95% UI 45·3–35·4) in the 
low ETL state group and 77% (81·1–73·1) in the high ETL 
group between 1990 and 2016.
Metabolic risks such as high systolic blood pressure, 
high fasting plasma glucose, high total cholesterol, and 
high body-mass index, along with dietary risks, which are 
predominantly associated with cardiovascular disease 
and diabetes, together were responsible for 15·9% and 
8·9% of the DALYs in India in 2016, respectively, as 
compared with 7·0% and 4·5% of the DALYs in 1990 
(data not shown). The number of DALYs and the all-age 
DALY rates from each of these risk factors increased in 
India from 1990 to 2016 (figure 8). The SEV of high 
systolic blood pressure did not significantly change 
in the low ETL state group between 1990 and 2016, 
but increased 5·9–10·6% in the other ETL state 
groups (table 3). The SEV of high fasting plasma glucose 
increased across all the ETL state groups by 32·5–53·3%. 
The SEV of high total cholesterol increased by 11·0% 
(95% UI 6·7–15·9) in the low ETL state group and by 
21·5% (15·7–27·8) in the high ETL state group. Large 
increases were recorded in the SEV of high body-mass 
index, ranging from 86·1% (95% UI 64·7–109·6) in the 
low ETL state group to 181·1% (140·3–227·5) in the high 
ETL state group. For the two leading individual risks 
under dietary risks, diet low in fruits and diet low in 
nuts and seeds, the 2016 SEVs were quite high (table 3). 
A modest reduction in these SEVs was recorded between 
1990 and 2016, and the reduction was greatest in the high 
ETL state group.
The all-age and age-standardised DALY rates due to 
tobacco use decreased in India from 1990 to 2016, but 
tobacco still contributed 8·3% of total DALYs in men and 
3·0% in women (figures 6, 8). The SEV of smoking 
decreased in India during this period by 22·9% (95% UI 
29·7–14·8), with the highest individual group decrease of 
37·9% (48·0–25·9) in the high ETL state group (table 3).
Life expectancy at birth in India was 66·9 years (95% UI 
66·2–67·6) for men and 70·3 years (69·6–71·0) for 
women in 2016, an increase of 8·6 years (7·8–9·5) for 
men and 10·6 (9·7–11·6) for women since 1990 (appendix 
p 129). The difference between the life expectancy 
increases for men and women was least for the high ETL 
state group (0·8 years greater increase for women than 
for men); for the other state groups this difference ranged 
from 1·9 years to 2·5 years. In 2016, the life expectancy 
of women was 4·9 years more than that of men in the 
high ETL state group, and 2·0 years more in the low 
ETL state group.
Discussion
The age-standardised DALY rate in India dropped by 
36% from 1990 to 2016, indicating overall progress in 
reducing disease burden. Behind this, however, are huge 
variations in the magnitude and progress across the 
states of India for the various diseases and risk factors. 
We offer insights into the challenges that need to be 
addressed to more effectively improve health across one 
of the most populous countries in the world. The NITI 
Aayog has articulated a progressive action agenda for 
improving health in the country from 2017 to 2020, 
which includes data-driven and decentralised health 
planning that is focused on the specific needs of each 
state.16 The state-level disease burden and risk factor 
estimates reported by the India State-Level Disease 
Burden Initiative can serve as a crucial aid in this health-
planning approach suggested by the premier thinktank 
of the Government of India.

Eight north Indian states that have low development 
indicators, which are referred to as the EAG states, along 
with the eight northeastern states and the two states of 
Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, have been 
the focus since 2005 of the National Rural Health 
Mission, which was renamed the National Health 
Mission in 2013.11 The findings in this paper show that 
generally, the EAG states have the lowest ETLs, followed 
by the north-eastern states, and then the others. However, 
some exceptions to this trend do exist, and significant 
variations were seen in the distribution of diseases and 
risk factors within these state groups that should be 
considered while planning health improvements in each 
state. In this Article we present the trends in disease 
burden and risk factors for states grouped by level of 
epidemiological transition as well as the key findings 
for individual states. The India State-Level Disease 
Burden Initiative policy report, which is being released 
Nov 14, 2017, provides detailed findings for individual 
states, including a profile of each state.24 These granular 
findings are expected to better define the health in-
equalities between the states, thereby leading to more 
focused attention on addressing these inequalities. Our 
findings can provide important inputs into how to fine 
tune in each state the components of the National Health 
Assurance efforts that the Government of India has 
undertaken.25 India’s 2017 National Health Policy has set 
out a series of disease-reduction targets.14 Monitoring the 
trends across the states with robust findings is crucial to 
understand where more effort is needed to meet the 
national targets.
The epidemiological transition ratio (DALYs due to 
CMNNDs vs NCDs and injuries combined) ranged from 
0·16 for Kerala to 0·74 for Bihar in 2016, a greater 
than four-times difference. The transition of disease 
epidemiology in India towards a dominance of NCDs 
and injuries from 1990 to 2016 is remarkable, with all 
states having a higher disease burden from NCDs and 
injuries than CMNNDs in 2016, in contrast to 1990, when 
the majority of disease burden in most states was due to 
CMNNDs. NCDs and injuries became the contributor to 
the majority of overall disease burden for India in 2003; 
but this event occurred from 1986 to 2010 for the four 
ETL state groups. The large low and higher-middle ETL 
state groups with 48% and 34% of India’s total population 
in 2016, contributed more to the overall India trend than 
the other two smaller ETL groups. The epidemiological 
transition ratio had a significant inverse relation with 
SDI, but the slope of this association had reduced by 
about half from 1990 to 2016, indicating reducing 
differences with increasing SDI over time. We stratified 
states by epidemiological transition ratio because we 
were interested in understanding disease and risk factor 
variations between and within the epidemiological 
transition levels. Another approach that could offer 
additional insights would be to assess variations by SDIs 
of the states.
Although the burden of CMNNDs has dropped 
substantially across all ETL state groups in India from 
1990 to 2016, the ratio of the observed to expected DALY 
rate for the SDI level of India is quite high for most 
of these diseases, indicating that India suffers a 
disproportionately higher burden of these diseases than 
other parts of the world with similar SDIs. The DALY 
rates due to the leading CMNNDs continue to be much 
higher in the low and lower-middle ETL states, showing 
the need for greater efforts in reducing the burden due to 
lower respiratory diseases, diarrhoeal diseases, neonatal 
disorders, iron-deficiency anaemia, and tuberculosis in 
these states.
The high neonatal and under-5 disease burden relative 
to other age groups, predominantly due to the leading

CMNNDs, continues to be a major priority for India. 
Intensive efforts to reduce this burden are necessary to 
meet the Sustainable Development Goals targets in 
2030.26 India has adopted the Newborn Action Plan, 
which is in synchrony with the Global Every Newborn 
Action Plan, focusing on 187 priority districts.27,28 
Remarkably, child and maternal malnutrition continues 
to be the leading risk factor in India, responsible for 15% 
of total DALYs in 2016; and unsafe water, sanitation, and 
handwashing still causes 5% of total DALYs in India. 
This trend continues despite major programmes in India 
for several decades to address these risk factors. The 
Government programme, Integrated Child Development 
Services, was launched in 1975 to provide supplementary 
nutrition, nutrition and health education, and other 
preschool development services across India; it had a 
total annual budget of more than US$2 billion in the 
2015–16 fiscal year.29 The Mid Day Meal Scheme, 
launched by the Government of India in 1995, provides 
free lunch to more than 120 million primary and upper-
primary school children and has an annual public 
expenditure of more than US$2 billion.30 In 2013, the 
Government of India legislated the National Food 
Security Act with the objective of providing food and 
nutritional security to the country’s population through 
provision of subsidised food grains and focused 
nutritional support to women and children.31 The Rural 
Sanitation Programme was launched by the Government 
of India in 1986, and has had several transformations 
since; the current more elaborate version is the Clean 
India Mission (Swachh Bharat Abhiyan), which was 
launched in 2014 by the Prime Minister of India as a 
major campaign to clean India and eliminate open 
defecation, with an estimated cost of about US$30 billion 
over 5 years.32,33 Notably, the burden of these risk factors 
continues to be the highest in the states with lower ETLs, 
with Bihar having the highest DALY rate in India due to 
child and maternal malnutrition and Jharkhand due to 
unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing. Although 
some improvements have been seen in overall nutrition, 
the exposure to iron deficiency in India has not improved 
much, though interventions for this risk have been 
attempted.34 An important challenge that needs to be 
addressed for a higher impact of interventions is efforts 
at behavioural change along with provision of better 
nutrition, safe water, and safe sanitation for higher 
uptake by those who need these most.35
India has the highest tuberculosis burden among the 
countries of the world, with a DALY rate more than three-
times higher than can be explained by its SDI level.36 India 
has scaled up basic tuberculosis services in the public 
health system, but the rate of decline in tuberculosis 
seems too slow to meet the 2030 Sustainable Development 
Goals and the 2035 End TB targets.26,36,37 Major challenges 
have been delayed detection and treatment of tubercu-
losis, inadequate surveillance, poor notification, and 
absence of coordination with the private health-care sector. 
A National Strategic Plan for Tuberculosis Elimination 
was announced in 2017 by India’s Revised National 
Tuberculosis Control Programme to achieve a 10–15% 
annual decline in the incidence of tuberculosis; this plan 
is estimated to cost US$2·5 billion over 5 years.36 The 
burden of tuberculosis varies markedly across the states of 
India, with the DALY rate of the highest-burden state at 
seven times that of the lowest-burden state. Control or 
elimination of malaria and some neglected tropical 
diseases, including visceral leishmaniasis, lymphatic 
filariasis, and leprosy have also been specified by the 
National Healthy Policy 2017 and NITI Aayog action 
agenda as priorities.14 The estimates produced by the India 
State-Level Disease Burden Initiative could be a useful 
reference for titrating the efforts according to the diverse 
epidemiology of tuberculosis and neglected tropical 
diseases across the states of India.
The all-age prevalence of most leading NCDs increased 
substantially in India from 1990 to 2016, but the age-
standardised prevalence increased only for diabetes, 
cerebrovascular disease, ischaemic heart disease, and 
skin diseases. This trend implies that the overall increase 
in NCD prevalence in India is a mixed phenomenon, 
with ageing of the population responsible for the increase 
in many NCDs plus an additional increase due to 
changes in risk exposure for the causes that have an age-
standardised increase in prevalence. From 1990 to 2016, 
all ETL state groups had a substantial increase in the 
number of NCD DALYs and no significant change in the 
all-age DALY rate but a significant modest decrease in 
the age-standardised DALY rates. These results imply 
that the improving health interventions in India have 
started blunting the NCD DALY burden to some degree. 
However, the interventions need to be greatly enhanced 
to achieve steeper declines in both the prevalence of 
DALYs and DALY rates from all NCDs. In 2016, the 
observed DALY rate in India exceeded the rate expected 
for its SDI level for several leading NCDs, namely 
ischaemic heart disease, COPD, sense organ disease 
(mainly vision and hearing loss disorders), migraine, 
asthma, and rheumatic heart disease.
The trajectory of the major risk factors for ischaemic 
heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes has 
been on the rise across all ETL state groups in India. 
Dietary risks, high systolic blood pressure, high fasting 
plasma glucose, high total cholesterol, and high body-
mass index together contributed about a quarter of the 
DALYs in India in 2016, which is more than twice their 
contribution in 1990. Tobacco use contributed 6% of 
DALYs in India in 2016. Intervention planning for major 
NCDs has picked up in India over the past decade or so. 
The National Programme for Prevention and Control of 
Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke 
was launched in India in 2010.38 The Government 
of India enacted the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco 
Products Act in 2003 to discourage the use of tobacco 
products, and the National Tobacco Control Programme 
 Articles

was launched in 2007
.39 The National Mental Health 
Programme has been in place in India since 1982,40 and 
the Mental Health Care Act was enacted in 2017
.41 
Although these national programmes and legislative 
acts indicate the interest of the Government of India in 
controlling the increasing burden of NCDs, the absence 
of strong declining trends for the prevalence of DALYs 
and DALY rates of most NCDs suggest that progress in 
the control of NCDs in India needs a bigger and more 
organised effort, supported by commensurate financial 
and human resources. These efforts would have to 
include extensive intersectoral collaborations, because 
many of the interventions needed for the control of 
NCDs go beyond the traditional health sector. The 
recent National Health Policy 2017 and the NITI Aayog 
action agenda have set targets for reduction of 
premature death and morbidity due to major NCDs in 
India.14,16 Monitoring of this progress would be aided by 
the ongoing production of reliable state-level estimates 
of disease burden and risk factors.
Exposure to air pollution in India is among the 
highest in the world,22 contributing to both NCDs and 
communicable diseases. Disease burden due to air 
pollution is highest in the low ETL state group, with 
Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar having the highest 
DALY rates. The burden from household air pollution is 
on the decline across all ETL state groups in India on 
account of the decreasing use of solid fuels for cooking. 
However, this decline was least in the low ETL group, 
suggesting that targeted subsidies to accelerate the 
transition to clean fuels is warranted. A recent initiative 
by the Prime Minister of India, the Pradhan Mantri 
Ujjwala Yojna, is expected to further increase access to 
clean cooking gas for households that are below the 
poverty line.42 However, the burden attributable to 
ambient air pollution continues to pose substantial 
challenges, because the current trajectory of emissions 
and dust from the power, industrial, transport, and 
construction sectors is likely to contribute to continuing 
increases in exposure across all ETL state groups. Policies 
are needed that effectively help increase the use of 
technologies that produce less emissions and dust in the 
sectors that are contributing to ambient air pollution. 
Enhanced monitoring of particulate matter smaller than 
2·5 μm at more sites across India by the Ministry of 
Environment and by the Ministry of Earth Sciences is 
expected to facilitate more granular understanding of air 
pollution trends.43,44
The number of DALYs caused by injuries increased 
significantly from 1990 to 2016 in all ETL state groups 
except the high ETL group, while both the all-age and 
age-standardised DALY rates for injuries decreased 
across all ETL state groups, indicating that the increase 
in number of DALYs was due to increase in population 
size. The all-age and age-standardised incidence rate of 
road injuries increased substantially during this period, 
and the all-age rates of self-harm and falls increased 
modestly but the age-standardised rates did not. The 
ratio of the observed DALY rate in India to the rate 
expected for its SDI level was close to two for self-harm 
and falls. However, injuries have typically received very 
little attention from policy makers and researchers in 
India.45,46 India does not have a comprehensive policy for 
injury prevention, and the multisectoral nature of 
interventions needed for the control of injuries is not 
addressed adequately. A National Road Safety Policy 
under the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways was 
announced in 2010, and the Ministry of Health has a 
capacity-building programme for trauma care facilities 
on the national highways, which have been implemented 
to varying extents.47,48 The National Highways Authority 
of India announced plans in 2017 to provide more prompt 
trauma care on highways.49 However, a comprehensive 
road injuries prevention and care approach is needed 
with balanced attention to safe road infrastructure, safe 
use of roads with enforcement, and appropriate trauma 
care. The multitude of reasons contributing to self-harm 
mean that the social determinants of self-harm must be 
addressed more effectively and better preventive mental 
health services should be provided.50–52 Prevention of falls 
and adequate management to reduce their population-
level burden requires a systematic effort in India that 
currently does not exist. Falls could be made a specific 
focus in the National Programme for Health Care of 
the Elderly.53
Notably, the estimated risk factors explain only about 
half of the disease burden in India, pointing to the need for 
enhancing the understanding of additional broader 
determinants of health.54,55 Two factors that will pose major 
challenges to the Indian health system over the next few 
decades are urbanisation and ageing of the population. 
Increasing unplanned urbanisation is a major challenge in 
India, with half of the population projected to be urban 
by 2050, up from a third at present.56 With increasing 
life expectancy and reducing premature mortality, the 
contribution of YLDs (disability) to the total DALYs 
(disease burden) will continue to increase. Long-term 
policy responses to these ongoing major transitions will be 
needed as part of comprehensive health planning for the 
states of India.
The main strengths of the findings presented in this 
paper are the following: (1) extensive efforts were made to 
identify, access, and use all available data that could 
contribute to the estimates for each state of India; 
(2) standardised GBD methods were used; and (3) a large 
network of leading health scientists and policy makers 
from India contributed to the analysis and interpretation 
of the estimates. The limitations of the findings include 
the general limitations of the GBD approach that are 
described elsewhere.18–22 Other limitations were specific to 
the India findings. First, India does not have an adequately 
functional cause-of-death reporting system. The Medical 
Certification of Cause of Death (MCCD) system under the 
Office of the Registrar General of India covered only

2457
22% of the deaths in India in 2015, with the coverage less 
than 20% in 15 states, 20–50% in ten states and union 
territories, and more than 50% in some states and union 
territories with less than 3% of India’s population.57 SRS 
provides cause-of-death data for all states in India using 
verbal autopsy. Verbal autopsy is considered a reasonable 
alternative for cause-of-death data when these data are not 
adequately available from the vital registration system.58–60 
Although the SRS cause-of-death data for the years 2004–13 
were very useful for the state-level disease burden 
estimates in this paper, a long-term plan and investment is 
needed to improve the coverage and quality of the MCCD 
system in India for more robust cause-of-death data. 
Second, disaggregated data for estimation of state-level 
population disease morbidity were scarce for some major 
conditions, including musculoskeletal disorders, chronic 
kidney disease, chronic respiratory diseases, cerebro-
vascular disease, and mental health and substance abuse 
disorders. When data are scarce for a disease or risk factor, 
GBD uses covariates and techniques that borrow strength 
from proximity and over time to arrive at the best possible 
estimates. Third, data on some risk factors were sparse 
across the states, including urban dietary intake and drug 
use at the population level. Findings released in 2017 from 
a multistate urban diet survey will enhance the estimates 
in the next GBD cycle. Fourth, GBD does not separately 
estimate the burden of Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya, 
and fluorosis. These conditions are important for India, 
and future GBD cycles are expected to estimate these. 
Broadly, India needs to systematically develop a comp-
rehensive health information system that can provide 
adequate data for ongoing and reliable mortality, 
morbidity, and risk factor estimation at suitable levels of 
geographic disaggregation, a notion supported by both 
the recent NITI Aayog action agenda and the National 
Health Policy. Details of the data gaps identified as part of 
the work of the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative 
can be used to inform development of an adequate health 
information system in India.
In conclusion, this analysis of epidemiological transition, 
disease burden, and risk factors across the states of India 
from 1990 to 2016 is perhaps the most comprehensive 
attempt so far to understand the entire landscape of 
disease epidemiology in India. The findings presented for 
groups of states at similar ETLs and for individual states 
can provide crucial and robust disaggregated inputs for 
steering health policy in India to improve population 
health in each state and union territory of the country. The 
ongoing work of the India State-Level Disease Burden 
Initiative could be a useful tool for NITI Aayog’s recently 
articulated vision of transforming health services and 
health outcomes in India over the next 15 years and for 
tracking progress in the goals and targets set by the 
National Health Policy 2017
.14,16 To achieve its optimal 
development potential, India should improve the health 
and nutritional status of its people in earnest now, 
investing more resources in social sectors as a result of its 
continuing impressive economic progress and using the 
increasing understanding of health heterogeneity across 
the country in a manner that reduces the major health 
inequalities between the nations within this nation, which 
comprises almost a fifth of the world’s population.
