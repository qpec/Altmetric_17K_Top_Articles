Abstract
Insulin replacement therapy is the standard of care for patients with type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes mellitus. Porcine and bovine 
pancreatic tissue was the source of the hormone for many years, followed by semisynthetic human insulin obtained by modification of 
animal insulin. With the development of recombinant DNA technology, recombinant (biosynthetic) human insulin became available in large 
amounts by biosynthesis in microorganisms (Escherichia coli, yeast) providing reliable supplies of the hormone worldwide at affordable 
costs. The purity and pharmaceutical quality of recombinant human insulin was demonstrated to be superior to animal and semisynthetic 
insulin and patients with diabetes could be safely and effectively transferred from animal or semisynthetic human insulin to recombinant 
human insulin with no change expected in insulin dose. The decision for change remains a clinical objective, follow-up after any change of 
insulin product is recommended to confirm clinical efficacy. This review provides a summary and retrospective assessment of early clinical 
studies with recombinant insulins (Insuman®, Humulin®, Novolin®).

Insulin preparations extracted from bovine or porcine pancreatic 
tissue have served as the mainstay of diabetes therapy since 1923, 
when commercial production was established in Europe and the 
US.1 Animal insulin sources became a limiting factor to provide 
sufficient supply of insulin for the increasing clinical demand of 
insulin worldwide. When the molecular structure of human insulin 
was elucidated, attempts were made at total chemical synthesis but 
failed to provide a clinically relevant supply.2,3 A next step towards 
obtaining clinically suitable human insulin was processing of animal 
insulin by exchange of amino acids and extensive purification.4–6 The 
modified material was addressed as ‘semisynthetic human insulin’ 
and all pharmaceutical formulations (regular, neutral protamine 
Hagedorn [NPH], premixed insulins) were manufactured from such 
semisynthetic insulin. At the time when semisynthetic human insulin 
was introduced to the market, there was an intensive and partly 
acrimonious discussion about this change in insulin source and about 
the clinical relevance of the need for ‘human insulin’. When clinical 
studies confirmed the comparable efficacy of this new type of insulin, 
the discussion subsequently focused on the improvements related to 
further purification, in particular, in decreasing the formation of insulin-
directed antibodies due to therapy, and reducing the risk of local and 
 
systemic allergic reactions.
‘Recombinant human insulin’ became available in large amounts by 
recombinant DNA technology using fermentation in microorganisms 
(bacteria or yeast). Recombinant insulin has a superior level of purity and 
consistent quality compared with semisynthetic insulin. The process of 
biosynthesis was initially developed by Genentech and rapidly applied 
on an industrial scale by Eli Lilly,2,6 followed by pharmaceutical and 
clinical process development at Novo Nordisk and Sanofi (formerly 
Hoechst AG/Hoechst Marion Roussel/Aventis). These companies are 
the lead manufacturers of recombinant human insulin (see Table 1), 
 
the human insulin profiles and clinical aspects have been described and 
reviewed extensively.7–9 Since its first introduction to clinical therapy in 
1982, recombinant human insulin represents the standard of care,10–12 
even after the introduction of insulin analogues.12 The standard of 
care in diabetes therapy is addressed by international treatment 
guidelines.10–12 Many clinical studies with recombinant human insulins 
submitted for regulatory approval have not been published in detail. 
Bioequivalence studies performed with recombinant Insuman® (Sanofi, 
Paris, France) have been reported recently.13 “Scientific Summaries and 
Public Assessment Reports” of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
for marketed human insulins including Insuman14 are found at the 
 
EMA website, and approval information at the website of the US Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA).15

 Recombinant Human Insulins – Clinical Efficacy and Safety in Diabetes Therapy
EUROPEAN ENDOCRINOLOGY
13
In this review, we report on unpublished pivotal clinical studies 
with recombinant Insuman documenting the efficacy and safety of 
semisynthetic and recombinant Insuman, and comparing recombinant 
Insuman with marketed formulations of Humulin® (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, 
Indiana, US). Furthermore, the use of insulin formulations in clinical 
practice is discussed to review the place of recombinant human insulin 
in routine clinical practice of today.  
Clinical Studies with Recombinant  
Human Insulins 
The initial clinical studies with recombinant human insulins (Humulin, 
Novolin®, Insuman) explored the change from animal insulin to 
semisynthetic insulin and to recombinant human insulin formulations. 
Clinical studies in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes included 
paediatric and pregnant subjects.16,17 Clinical pharmacology studies 
using the euglycaemic clamp technique were performed to demonstrate 
bioquivalence between the insulin formulations.13 The clinical studies of 
6 to 12 months duration focused on clinical efficacy and safety. Safety 
aspects comprised the incidence of hypoglycaemia, the perception of 
decreasing glucose levels (hypoglycaemic awareness) and the level 
of manifestations of antigenicity (hypersensitivity reactions). Special 
interest was directed at the antigenicity response (insulin-directed 
antibodies, and antibodies to Escherichia coli or Saccharomcyes 
cerevisiae proteins) remaining after extensive purification of the 
preproinsulin.18–23 Clinical study objectives were incidence and severity 
of hypoglycaemia,24–26 injection-site reactions and adverse events (AEs) 
profile. Glycaemic targets (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c], fasting blood 
glucose [FBG]) were usually defined individually for each subject by the 
investigators. Insulin dose titration did not yet follow a fasting treat-to-
target concept at that time.27
Humulin and Novolin
The pharmaceutical formulations of recombinant human insulins provided 
by the key manufacturers include soluble regular insulin, crystalline NPH 
insulin and premixed formulations (soluble insulin and NPH insulin in fixed 
ratios). The formulations were found to be bioequivalent and similar in 
efficacy and safety to those of semisynthetic insulin.7–9,13,19 Bioequivalence 
studies comparing porcine insulin with recombinant human insulin 
showed small differences in the time–action profile, but were comparable 
in clinical efficacy.19
 
Clinical studies with semisynthetic and recombinant insulin derived 
from baker’s yeast (Novolin, Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark) 
showed similar profiles in efficacy and safety and established that 
patients with diabetes can be safely and effectively transferred from 
semisynthetic human insulin to recombinant human insulin with no 
change expected in the insulin dose.28–31 
Clinical pharmacology studies with recombinant human insulin 
produced by fermentation in E. coli (Humulin, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis) 
established bioequivalence of semisynthetic and recombinant Humulin 
formulations.14,32,33 Extensive clinical studies were performed in patients 
with type 1 and type 2 diabetes14,33–36 to confirm consistent clinical efficacy 
when transferring patients to the recombinant formulations.14,33,34
Insuman
Recombinant Insuman was approved in Europe in 1997 and launched 
in 1999. The early clinical studies are summarised in the EMA approval 
documents.37 The formulations comprise regular soluble insulin (Insuman 
Rapid), an intermediate-acting insulin suspension that contains isophane 
insulin (Insuman Basal), and premixed combinations of regular insulin 
and intermediate-acting insulins (Insuman Comb).13,38 During early 
studies, the bioequivalence of formulations based on semisynthetic 
insulin and recombinant Insuman was established (see Figure 1),39 
subsequently bioequivalence studies for comparison with marketed 
recombinant insulin formulations were performed13 and followed by the 
clinical studies reviewed here.
Two pivotal clinical studies with recombinant Insuman were conducted 
in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes investigating the efficacy 
and safety of the change from semisynthetic insulin to recombinant 
Insuman,40 and in comparison with recombinant insulin formulations of

Huminsulin®.41 An overview of the patient characteristics and the key 
efficacy and safety results of the two studies are provided in Table 2.
In a first multinational, randomised, double-blind 24-week study 
including 575 adult patients with diabetes (87% with type 1, 33% 
type 2), patients were stratified either to a free combination of NPH 
insulin (crystalline, basal), with or without regular insulin, or to a 
fixed combination of Insuman Comb 25/75 and randomised to either 
recombinant or semisynthetic insulin preparations in each group. Of 
the randomised patients, 96% had been treated with insulin prior to the 
study and 37% of patients had a history of diabetic late complications, 
and 42% had frequent mild hypoglycaemic episodes during the year 
before start of the study. The glycaemic target was to achieve a FBG 
value of 140 mg/dl or lower.
Both recombinant and semisynthetic human insulin achieved a similar 
decrease of HbA1c and FBG after 24 weeks. Subgroups analyses by 
age, gender, type of diabetes, prior insulin treatment and presence 
of diabetic late complications demonstrated similar outcomes. There 
has been an intense discussion about perception of hypoglycaemia 
in patients previously treated with animal insulins after changing 
to semisynthetic or recombinant human insulins.24,25 In this study 
no difference in incidence of symptomatic hypoglycaemia and in 
calculated episodes per patient-year were found, as well as no change 
in the perception of hypoglycaemia. 
Antigenicity has always been a concern when using animal insulins. 
However, early studies showed that antigenicity decreased markedly 
when changing from animal insulins to recombinant insulins.

 Recombinant Human Insulins – Clinical Efficacy and Safety in Diabetes Therapy
EUROPEAN ENDOCRINOLOGY
15
In this study, the level of insulin antibodies related to insulin exposure 
before treatment was very low, and there was no relevant increase 
after treatment with semisynthetic insulin or recombinant Insuman. 
In addition, there was a very low level of antibodies detected 
 
to E. coli proteins in patients treated with recombinant insulin. The 
absence of such proteins is particularly relevant for the pharmaceutical 
quality of recombinant insulins after intensive purification. The 
number of patients with AEs, serious AEs and with local and 
systemic reactions to insulin injection also did not differ between 
 
the insulin treatments. 
In a second multinational, randomised, open-label 54-week study in 
473 insulin-naïve subjects with type 2 diabetes the efficacy and safety 
of recombinant Insuman was compared with recombinant Huminsulin 
formulations. Huminsulin formulations were selected as a comparator 
based on bioequivalence confirmed with Insuman.13 Treatments 
comprised regular insulin, crystalline NPH insulin and premixed insulins 
(Insuman Comb 25 and 50, Huminsulin 30/70). Selection of treatment 
regimen was at the discretion of the investigators and individual dose 
titration was applied to achieve the best possible glycaemic control for 
each subject. 
The primary study objective was an evaluation of antigenicity and 
measurement of antibodies to human insulin and E. coli proteins.20–23 
Further safety aspects included hypoglycaemia assessment, local or 
general manifestations of insulin allergy and clinical AEs during treatment.
As expected for insulin-naïve type 2 subjects, the insulin antibody 
binding increased in both treatment groups while on insulin treatment, 
with no relevant difference between groups. In both groups, increased 
insulin antibody binding was not associated with deterioration 
of metabolic control or a marked increase on the insulin dose 
 
or hypoglycaemia incidence. At study endpoint, 52% and 49% 
of Insuman- and Huminsulin-treated subjects, respectively, had 
detectable insulin antibody binding. Similar results were found for E. 
coli antibody binding status. Only two Insuman and eight Huminsulin 
subjects had an increase in their E. coli protein antibody titre from 
baseline to endpoint. 
Randomised patients had a poor glycaemic control at baseline. As a 
result of insulin treatment, a clinically relevant decrease from baseline 
to endpoint was observed in HbA1c and FBG in both treatment groups, 
with no statistically significant difference (see Table 2). Throughout 
the entire treatment phase, 40% and 44% of Insuman and Huminsulin 
patients reported at least one episode of symptomatic hypoglycaemia, 
respectively, and only a few subjects in both treatment groups reported 
moderate or severe hypoglycaemia during the study. The frequency 
and spectrum of non-serious and serious AEs were comparable in 
both treatment groups. Hypersensitivity events of mild or moderate 
intensity were reported in 12 Insuman and in one Huminsulin subject, 
respectively. These events were associated with pre-existing skin 
disorders, allergic reactions to concomitant medication or allergic 
diathesis. None of the 12 Insuman subjects discontinued treatment 
because of a hypersensitivity event. Injection-site haemorrhage 
occurred occasionally and was attributed to poor injection technique. 
Injection-site reactions42 were reduced dramatically when educational 
training for regular changes in injection sites along with improved 
injection techniques were initiated during the study. None of the 
subjects in either treatment group discontinued treatment because of 
injection site reactions.
In summary, both studies demonstrated improvements in glycaemic 
control and good tolerability with Insuman in type 1 and type 2 
diabetes patients comparable to comparator treatment. In addition,no 
difference in immunogenicity between Insuman and Huminsulin 
or semisynthetic insulin was found, an important characteristic of 
recombinant insulin formulations.20–23
Clinical Use of Recombinant Human  
Insulin Formulations
The change from semisynthetic synthesis to recombinant rDNA 
technology1,2 has enabled a worldwide human insulin supply of 
consistent high quality. The range of different insulin formulations 
derived from recombinant human insulin allows for an individual 
patient’s tailored treatment using different regimens that have been 
proved effective and safe in the long term (see Table 3). Hypoglycaemia 
associated with insulin treatment remains one of the major challenges 
during therapy; to minimise the risk, close monitoring and guidance 
for the patient is recommended, particularly during initial and any 
later dose titration. Self-monitoring of fasting and post-prandial blood 
glucose are helpful tools to avoid or reduce hypoglycaemia and to 
maintain blood glucose values in the target range. Therefore, patient 
education and guidance is a general task of insulin therapy to ensure a 
continued adherence to therapy and good metabolic control.

EUROPEAN ENDOCRINOLOGY
Regular Human Insulin
In this review, the use of formulations of recombinant insulin, in 
particular that of Insuman, is considered with references to daily 
clinical practice, in diabetes therapy of today. The clinical evidence 
for an injection-to-meal interval of about 30 minutes (prandial insulin) 
is based on the time–action profile of regular insulin,13,39 to match 
subcutaneous insulin absorption with ingestion of carbohydrates (see 
Figure 2).43,44 This ensures efficacy, albeit at the disadvantage of having 
to follow a more restrictive lifestyle. Subsequent studies have shown 
some advantage for insulin analogues in reducing the injection-to-
meal interval, at the expense of increasing the cost of therapy. 
In clinical emergency, Insuman Rapid may be injected or infused 
intravenously under strict glucose control. When using continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pumps), there is a clear clinical 
preference for fast-acting insulin analogues in the paediatric population. 
Studies with a specific formulation (Insuman Infusat) in external 
portable insulin pumps have shown improved stability to minimise 
loss of efficacy, which may result from mechanical and thermal stress. 
 
A limited number of studies have been performed for the use of Insuman 
Infusat in external insulin pumps, and with Insuman Implantable in 
intraperitoneal insulin pumps.45,46
Neutral Protamine Hagedorn Insulin 
Intermediate-acting NPH insulin has been used extensively for basal 
insulin supply, the clinical efficacy has been well documented47,48 
and the associated quality of life has not been found to be worse 
when compared with long-acting insulin glargine.49 There has been a 
discussion about once- or twice-daily injections,  in the morning and 
at dinner time/bedtime.50 Limitations of clinical utility when using NPH 
insulin are the duration of action and more frequent hypoglycaemia 
episodes than with long-acting insulin analogues. Another limitation is 
the need for re-suspension immediately before each injection.
In several clinical trials, where human NPH insulin was used as the 
comparator for insulin glargine47,45,51,52 comparable glycaemic control 
was found, whereas the incidence of nocturnal hypoglycaemia was 
reduced with insulin glargine. Decreased incidence of hypoglycaemia 
was also described with other long-acting analogue insulins (detemir, 
degludec). NPH insulin in vials or insulin pens needs to be re-suspended 
immediately before the injection. This requires patient guidance and 
instruction to ensure consistent adherence to this procedure. Twice-daily 
injections of NPH insulin, in the morning and at dinner time/bedtime, 
are recommended by some clinicians because the time–action profile of 
NPH insulin does not adequately cover the 24-hour period (see Figure 2). 
The recommendation for twice-daily injection is valid for premixed 
insulins, which contain a 70–75% fraction of NPH insulin.
Premixed Insulins
In the early clinical period of using semisynthetic insulins from vials, 
patients used to perform the mixing themselves using two separate 
vials of regular insulin and NPH insulin. In several studies, premixed 
insulins were compared with self-mixed insulins, and formulations 
were developed for the use in cartridges containing a ratio of soluble 
to NPH insulin over a range which varied from 15/85 to 50/50.
Today, the ratio of 30/70 is most frequently used both in pens with 
cartridges and disposable insulin pens.38 Premixed insulins are 
recommended for patients with a regular lifestyle and consistent 
insulin requirement. When compared with premixed insulin 
analogues, they retain the advantages of low cost and established 
efficacy. The availability of reliable and affordable insulin pens has 
contributed markedly to patient convenience in countries with 
limited resources.53
Use in Pregnancy and Gestational Diabetes
Human insulin is the standard of care in pregnant women.17,54 In the 
early clinical studies in pregnancy, the change from animal insulins to 
recombinant insulin was addressed and subsequently implemented.17 
Consistent glucose monitoring and dose adaptation is important 
throughout pregnancy and counselling needs to be established 
within the programme of pregnancy care for mothers with diabetes. 
Gestational diabetes develops during pregnancy and may disappear 
after parturition. The condition of gestational diabetes has received 
much attention, because there are established treatment options 
with insulin during pregnancy, which have considerable efficacy in 
preventing foetal macrosomia,55 in a similar manner as for women 
with established diabetes prior to pregnancy. The use of human insulin 
and Insuman formulations during pregnancy has been monitored 
in pharmacovigilance programmes (periodic safety updates, risk-
management plan) and found to be safe.
Use in Paediatrics
The change from animal insulins to recombinant human insulin is 
well documented in the paediatric population7,16 and is found to be an 
advantage because the decrease in manifestations of antigenicity is 
particularly relevant in children. The preference for use in children has 
been included in guidelines.10 Consistent glucose monitoring is required 
because of the widely varying dose requirement and distinct changes in 
insulin requirement during the growth period of children.
The Place of Recombinant Human Insulin in 
Diabetes Therapy
When considering efficacy, there is clearly an established place for 
human insulin formulations in the therapy of type 1 (multiple daily 
injections) and type 2 diabetes. This is clearly addressed in current 
guidelines.10–12 The need for action is particularly urgent in type 2 
diabetes.10 When comparing cost of therapies, recombinant human 
insulin formulations are the choice for countries in patients with limited 
resources. In countries with more ample resources, combination 
therapy is now extensively investigated, e.g. adding glucagon-like 
peptide 1 agonists or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors,56,57 and by once-
daily injection of prandial insulin.27,56–58
Convenience of using insulins analogue is well established, and there 
is a certain advantage in reducing hypoglycaemic episodes.24,25,48 The 
established regiments of basal, premixed and basal–bolus therapy 
can be implemented with the available range of human insulin 
formulations when access to insulin analogues and reimbursement 
are not available.
The essential conditions for improving therapy are glucose monitoring, 
its frequent implementation, continuing patient education about insulin 
injection technique42 and how to re-suspend NPH premixed insulins 
before each injection. Although adherence to recommendations for 
storage conditions is helpful, there is, however, no difference from the 
analogue insulins in this respect. In light of worldwide awareness that 
early implementation of insulin therapy can prevent or delay diabetes 
complications, access to affordable insulin therapy is the predominant 
factor when considering recombinant human insulin formulations.

Conclusions 
As the burden of diabetes is predicted to increase dramatically in the next 
decades, the demand of insulin in sufficient amounts and at affordable 
costs remains a challenge, particularly in developing countries. For that 
reason, recombinant human insulin formulations are considered to 
be effective alternatives to insulin analogues in countries with limited 
healthcare systems and limited resources. Continuing patient education 
support programmes on disease management and correct use of 
human insulins are essential (e.g. re-suspension of NPH and premixed 
formulations, injection technique, adequate storage) for a key role 
of recombinant human insulins in diabetes treatment. In developing 
countries, improving access to human insulin can support initiatives for 
earlier insulin therapy, to improve glycaemic control in the communities, 
and finally to delay or reduce diabetes complications in the long term. n
