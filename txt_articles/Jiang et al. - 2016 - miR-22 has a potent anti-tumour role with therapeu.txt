MicroRNAs are subject to precise regulation and have key roles in tumorigenesis. In contrast
to the oncogenic role of miR-22 reported in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and breast
cancer, here we show that miR-22 is an essential anti-tumour gatekeeper in de novo acute
myeloid leukaemia (AML) where it is significantly downregulated. Forced expression of
miR-22 significantly suppresses leukaemic cell viability and growth in vitro, and substantially
inhibits leukaemia development and maintenance in vivo. Mechanistically, miR-22 targets
multiple oncogenes, including CRTC1, FLT3 and MYCBP, and thus represses the CREB and MYC
pathways. The downregulation of miR-22 in AML is caused by TET1/GFI1/EZH2/SIN3A-
mediated epigenetic repression and/or DNA copy-number loss. Furthermore, nanoparticles
carrying miR-22 oligos significantly inhibit leukaemia progression in vivo. Together, our study
uncovers a TET1/GFI1/EZH2/SIN3A/miR-22/CREB-MYC signalling circuit and thereby
provides insights into epigenetic/genetic mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AML,
and also highlights the clinical potential of miR-22-based AML therapy.

 A
s one of the most common and fatal forms of hematopoietic
malignancies, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is frequently
associated with diverse chromosome translocations (for
example t(11q23)/MLL-rearrangements, t(15;17)/PML-RARA and
t(8;21)/AML1-ETO) and molecular abnormalities (for example,
internal tandem duplications of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) and mutations in
nucleophosmin (NPM1c þ))1. Despite intensive chemotherapies,
the majority of patients with AML fail to survive longer than
5 years2,3. Thus, development of effective therapeutic strategies
based on a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms
underlying the pathogenesis of AML is urgently needed.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs
that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression4. Individual
miRNAs may play distinct roles in cancers originating from
different tissues or even from different lineages of hematopoietic
cells4. It is unclear whether a single miRNA can play distinct roles
between malignancies originating from the same hematopoietic
lineage, such as de novo AML and myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS). Although around 30% of MDS cases transform to AML,
the genetic and epigenetic landscapes of MDS or MDS-derived
AML are largely different from those of de novo AML5,6. MDS
and MDS-derived AML are more responsive to hypomethylating
agents
than
de
novo
AML7.
The
molecular
mechanisms
underlying the distinct pathogenesis and drug response between
MDS (or MDS-derived AML) and de novo AML remain unclear.
The ten-eleven translocation (Tet1/2/3) proteins play critical
transcriptional regulatory roles in normal developmental processes
as activators or repressors8–10. In contrast to the frequent loss-of-
function mutations and tumour-suppressor role of TET2 observed
in hematopoietic malignancies11–13, we recently reported that
TET1 plays an essential oncogenic role in MLL-rearranged AML
where it activates expression of homeobox genes14. However, it is
unknown whether TET1 can also function as a transcriptional
repressor in cancer. Moreover, Tet1-mediated regulation of
miRNA expression has rarely been studied10.
In the present study, we demonstrate that miR-22, an
oncogenic miRNA reported in breast cancer and MDS15,16, is
significantly downregulated in most cases of de novo AML due to
TET1/GFI1/EZH2/SIN3A-mediated epigenetic repression and/or
DNA copy-number loss. miR-22 functions as an essential anti-
tumour gatekeeper in various AML and holds great therapeutic
potential to treat AML.
Results
The downregulation of miR-22 in de novo AML. Through
Exiqon miRNA array profiling, we previously identified a set
of miRNAs, such as miR-150, miR-148a, miR-29a, miR-29b,
miR-184, miR-342, miR-423 and miR-22, which are significantly
downregulated in AML compared with normal controls17. Here we
showed that among all the above miRNAs, miR-150 and especially
miR-22 exhibited the most significant and consistent inhibitory
effect on MLL-AF9-induced cell immortalization in colony-
forming/replating assays (CFA) (Supplementary Fig. 1a). In
contrast to the reported upregulation of miR-22 in MDS16, our
original microarray data17 (Fig. 1a,b) and new quantitative PCR-
independent validation data (Supplementary Fig. 1b) demonstrated
a significant and global downregulation of miR-22 in de novo AML
relative to normal controls. Notably, miR-22 is significantly
downregulated in AML samples (Po0.05) compared with all
three sub-populations of normal control cells, that is, normal
CD34þ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), CD33þ
myeloid progenitor cells, or mononuclear cells (MNCs) (Fig. 1a).
Expression of miR-22 is significantly downregulated in all or the
majority of individual subsets of AML samples than in the normal
CD33þ or CD34þ cell samples (Fig. 1b).
To rule out the possibility that the inhibitory effect of miR-22
shown in Supplementary Fig. 1a was due to a non-specific effect of
our miR-22 construct, we included the MSCV-PIG-miR-22 construct
from Song et al.16 in a repeated CFA. Both miR-22 constructs
dramatically inhibited MLL-AF9-induced colony formation (Fig. 1c).
As the ‘seed’ sequences at the 50 end of individual miRNAs are
essential for the miRNA-target binding18, we also mutated the
6-bases ‘seed’ sequence of miR-22 and found that the miR-22 mutant
did not inhibit colony formation anymore (Fig. 1c). In human AML
cells, forced expression of miR-22, but not miR-22 mutant,
significantly inhibited cell viability and growth/proliferation, while
promoting apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 1c,d).
Furthermore, as miR-22 is globally downregulated in all major
types of AML (Fig. 1b), we also investigated the role of miR-22 in
colony formation induced by other oncogenic fusion genes,
including MLL-AF10/t(10;11), PML-RARA/t(15;17) and AML1-
ETO9a/t(8;21) (ref. 19). As expected, forced expression of miR-22
significantly inhibited colony formation induced by all individual
oncogenic fusions; conversely, miR-22 knockout20 significantly
enhanced colony forming (Fig. 1d). These results suggest that
miR-22 likely plays a broad anti-tumour role in AML.
In accordance with the potential anti-tumour function of
miR-22 in AML, miR-22 was expressed at a significantly higher
level (Po0.05) in human normal CD33 þ myeloid progenitor
cells than in more immature CD34 þ HSPCs or MNC cells
(a mixed population containing both primitive progenitors and
committed cells) (Fig. 1a,b), implying that miR-22 is upregulated
during normal myelopoiesis. Similarly, we showed that miR-22
was also expressed at a significantly higher level in mouse normal
bone marrow (BM) myeloid (Gr-1 þ/Mac-1 þ) cells, relative to
lineage negative (Lin �) progenitor cells, long-term hematopoietic
stem
cells
(LT-HSCs),
short-term
HSCs
(ST-HSCs),
and
committed progenitors (CPs) (Supplementary Fig. 1e), further
suggesting that miR-22 is upregulated in normal myelopoiesis.
The anti-tumour effect of miR-22 in the pathogenesis of AML.
Through bone marrow transplantation (BMT) assays, we showed
that forced expression of miR-22 (but not miR-22 mutant) drama-
tically blocked MLL-AF9 (MA9)-mediated leukemogenesis in
primary BMT recipient mice, with a more potent inhibitory effect
than miR-150 (Fig. 1e; Supplementary Fig. 2a). All MA9 þ miR-22
mice exhibited normal morphologies in peripheral blood (PB), BM,
spleen and liver tissues (Fig. 1f), with a substantially reduced c-Kit þ
blast cell population in BM (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Forced
expression of miR-22 also almost completely inhibited leukemo-
genesis induced by MLL-AF10 (Fig. 1g; Supplementary Fig. 2a).
Conversely, miR-22 knockout significantly promoted AML1-ETO9a
(AE9a)-induced AML (Fig. 1h). Thus, the repression of miR-22 is
critical for the development of primary AML. Notably, forced
expression of miR-22 in MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF10 leukaemia mouse
models caused only a 2–3-fold increase in miR-22 expression level
(Supplementary Fig. 2a), in a degree comparable to the difference in
miR-22 expression levels between human AML samples and normal
controls (Fig. 1a), suggesting that a 2–3-fold change in miR-22
expression level appears to be able to exert significant physiological
or pathological effects.
To examine whether the maintenance of AML is also
dependent on the repression of miR-22, we performed secondary
BMT assays. Forced expression of miR-22 remarkably inhibited
progression
of
MLL-AF9-,
AE9a-
or
FLT3-ITD/NPM1c þ-
induced AML in secondary recipient mice (Fig. 2a–d), resulting
in largely normal morphologies in PB, BM, spleen and liver
tissues (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Fig. 2c). Collectively, our findings
demonstrate that miR-22 is a pivotal anti-tumour gatekeeper in
both development and maintenance of various AML.

 Identification of critical target genes of miR-22 in AML. To
identify potential targets of miR-22 in AML, we performed a
series of data analysis. Analysis of In-house_81S (ref. 21) and
TCGA_177S (ref. 22) data sets revealed a total of 999 genes
exhibiting
significant
inverse
correlations
with
miR-22
in
expression. Of them, 137 genes, including 21 potential targets
of miR-22 as predicted by TargetScan18 (Supplementary Table 1),
were significantly upregulated in both human and mouse AML
compared with normal controls as detected in two additional in-
house data sets14,23. Among the 21 potential targets, CRTC1,

 ETV6 and FLT3 are known oncogenes24–29. We then focused
on these three genes, along with MYCBP that encodes the
MYC-binding protein and is an experimentally validated target of
miR-22 (ref. 30) although due to a technical issue it was not shown
in the 21-gene list (Supplementary Table 1), for further studies.
As expected, all four genes were significantly downregulated in
expression by ectopic expression of miR-22 in human MONO-
MAC-6/t(9;11) cells (Fig. 3a). The coincidence of downregulation
of those genes and upregulation of miR-22 was also observed in
mouse MLL-ENL-ERtm cells, a leukaemic cell line with an
inducible MLL-ENL derivative31, when MLL-ENL was depleted
by
4-hydroxy-tamoxifen
(4-OHT)
withdrawal
(Fig.
3b;
Supplementary Fig. 3a). While MLL-AF9 remarkably promoted
expression of those four genes in mouse BM progenitor cells, co-
expressed
miR-22 reversed the upregulation
(Fig. 3c). In
leukaemia BM blast cells of mice with MLL-AF9-induced AML,
the expression of Crtc1, Flt3 and Mycbp, but not Etv6, was
significantly downregulated by co-expressed miR-22 (but not by
miR-22
mutant)
(Fig.
3d).
Because
miR-22-mediated
downregulation of Etv6 could be observed only in the in vitro
models (Fig. 3a–c), but not in the in vivo model (Fig. 3d), which
was probably due to the difference between in vitro and in vivo
microenvironments, we decided to focus on the three target genes
(that is, Crtc1, Flt3 and Mycbp) that showed consistent patterns
between in vitro and in vivo for further studies. The repression of
Crtc1, Flt3 and Mycbp was also found in leukaemia BM cells of
mice with AE9a or FLT3-ITD/NPM1c þ-induced AML (Fig. 3e,f).
As Mycbp is already a known target of miR-22 (ref. 30), here we
further confirmed that FLT3 and CRTC1 are also direct targets of
miR-22 (Fig. 3g,h). The downregulation of CRTC1, FLT3 and
MYCBP by miR-22 at the protein level was confirmed in both
human and mouse leukaemic cells (Supplementary Fig. 3b,c).
Overexpression of miR-22 had no significant influence on the
level of leukaemia fusion genes (Supplementary Fig. 3d).
Co-expression of the coding region (CDS) of each of the three
target genes (that is, CRTC1, FLT3 and MYCBP) largely reversed
the effects of miR-22 on cell viability, apoptosis and proliferation
(Fig. 4a–e). More importantly, in vivo BMT assays showed that
co-expressing CRTC1, FLT3 or MYCBP largely rescued the
inhibitory
effect
of
miR-22
on
leukemogenesis
(Fig.
4f,g;
Supplementary Fig. 3e). Our data thus suggest that CRTC1, FLT3
and MYCBP are functionally important targets of miR-22 in AML.

 miR-22 represses both CREB and MYC signalling pathways.
CRTC1, a CREB-regulated transcription coactivator, facilitates
CREB in regulating transcription of its targets, in both normal
and malignant hematopoiesis24–26. CDK6, HOXA7 and RGS2 are
known direct targets of CREB that are either positively (CDK6
and HOXA7) or negatively (RGS2) regulated by CREB32–35.
In both In-house_81S (ref. 21) and TCGA_177S (ref. 22) data
sets, CDK6 and HOXA7 inversely, while RGS2 positively,
correlated with miR-22 in expression (Supplementary Table 2;
Supplementary Fig. 3f). In leukaemic BM blast cells from primary
and secondary BMT recipients, overexpression of miR-22 (but
not miR-22 mutant) significantly downregulated expression of
Cdk6 and Hoxa7, while upregulating Rgs2, which could be
reversed by co-expressing CRTC1 (Supplementary Fig. 3g,h).
These results suggest that miR-22 represses the CREB signalling
pathway in AML by targeting CRTC1.

FLT3

of miR-22, but not miR-22 mutant, significantly repressed
expression of MYC downstream oncogenic targets Bmi1, Fasn
and Hmga1 (refs 36–38); the repression could be reversed by co-
expressing MYCBP or FLT3 (Supplementary Fig. 3i,j). Those
three genes all showed significant inverse correlations with miR-
22 in expression in human AML (Supplementary Table 2;
Supplementary Fig. 3f). The miR-22-induced repression of Bmi1,
Cdk6 and Hmga1 at the protein level was also observed
(Supplementary Fig. 3c).

 DNA copy-number loss of miR-22 gene locus in AML. DNA
copy-number loss of tumour-suppressor gene(s) is a hallmark of
many cancers including AML39. Deletions of human chromosome
17 band p13.3, where miR-22 is located, have been frequently
reported in various types of leukaemia, lymphoma and solid
tumours40–43. Here we found that 18% (9/50) of the AML samples
showed deletions (mostly hemizygous) of the miR-22 gene locus
(Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). Similarly, in analysis of three publically
available AML data sets, we found that 7–9% of the AML cases
carried loss of one or even two alleles of the miR-22 locus
(Supplementary Fig. 4c). Therefore, DNA copy-number loss in
miR-22 gene locus does exist in AML cases.
Expression of miR-22 is epigenetically repressed in AML. It was
reported that TET2 is repressed by miR-22 as its direct target in

 breast cancer and MDS15,16. Here we analysed the expression
patterns of TET1/2/3 and miR-22 in three independent AML
patient data sets21,22,44 (Supplementary Table 3). To our surprise,
we found that TET2 (and likely also TET3) exhibited a positive
correlation, whereas only TET1 exhibited a negative correlation,
with miR-22 in expression in AML (Supplementary Table 3;
Fig. 5a). The primary, precursor and mature miR-22 levels were
all significantly downregulated by MLL-AF9, MLL-AF10, AE9a
and FLT3-ITD/NPM1c þ in colony-forming cells, while Tet1
(but not Tet2 or Tet3) was upregulated (Fig. 5b). Conversely, in
MLL-ENL-ERtm cells31, Tet1, but not Tet2 or Tet3, was
downregulated when miR-22 was upregulated after withdrawal
of 4-OHT (Fig. 5c). Thus, Tet1, instead of Tet2, exhibited an
inverse correlation with miR-22 in expression in both human and
mouse leukaemic cells. Tet1 also exhibits an inverse correlation
with miR-22 in expression during mouse normal myeloid
differentiation (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Furthermore, as miR-22
and TET1 were expressed at a significantly higher and lower level,
respectively, in human normal CD33 þ myeloid progenitor cells
than in CD34 þ HSPCs or MNCs (see Fig. 1a and ref. 14), the
inverse expressional correlation between miR-22 and TET1 likely
also existed in human normal hematopoietic cells.
However, forced expression of miR-22 caused no noticeable
changes in Tet1 expression in MLL-AF9, AE9a or FLT3-ITD/
NPM1c þ
colony-forming cells (Fig. 5d). Similarly, neither
miR-22 knockout nor overexpression resulted in any significant
changes of Tet1/TET1 expression (Fig. 5e,f). In contrast, Tet1
knockout remarkably increased the levels of pri-, pre- and mature
miR-22 (Fig. 5g). Thus, our data suggest that miR-22 is a
downstream target of and negatively regulated by Tet1, and that
there is no negative feedback of miR-22 on Tet1 expression.
Tet1 has been shown to cooperate with Polycomb repressive
complex 2 (PRC2) components and cofactors, such as Ezh2 and
Sin3a, to repress transcription of their co-target genes in mouse
embryonic stem cells8,9. Our luciferase reporter assay showed that
forced
expression
of
Tet1
significantly
repressed
the
transcriptional activity controlled by the miR-22 promoter45,
suggesting that miR-22 is a direct repressed target of Tet1
(Fig.
6a).

 that on treatment with ATRA, TET1 (but not TET2 or TET3),
EZH2 and SIN3A were significantly downregulated, accompanied
by the upregulation of miR-22 (Fig. 6b). WDR81 is the gene that
is located closely (within 500 bp) but oppositely to the miR-22
gene loci (Fig. 6d). We also tested the potential influence of
ATRA on the expression level of WDR81 in the same model.
ATRA treatment showed no significant effects on WDR81 level
(Supplementary Fig. 5b), suggesting that TET1 specifically
inhibits the transcription of miR-22, but not its neighbouring
gene with the opposite orientation.
While miR-22 expression level had a more than fivefold
increase on ATRA treatment, the degrees of decrease in
expression levels of TET1, EZH2 and SIN3A are relatively mild
(though statistically significant) (Fig. 6b). To identify additional
transcription factor(s) that is (are) more responsive to ATRA
treatment and can facilitate TET1 binding to miR-22 promoter
region, we searched for transcription factors that have evolutio-
narily conserved binding sites within the CpG island of miR-22
locus. Among a set of such transcription factors (including GFI1,
STAT, PAX4, HMX1 and SRF), only GFI1 exhibited a significant

 inverse correlation with miR-22 in expression in all large-scale
AML cohorts (Supplementary Table 3). Interestingly, it was
reported previously that ATRA treatment could significantly
diminish the binding of GFI1 to the loci of many of its target
genes, for example, IL-6R, JAK3, E2F6 and so on47. Thus, we
chose GFI1 for further studies.
Notably, we found that ATRA treatment substantially reduced
the transcription level of GFI1 in AML cells and its decrease
degree was greater than that of TET1, EZH2 or SIN3A (Fig. 6b).
We further showed that GFI1 is a binding partner of TET1 in
both THP1 and HEK-293T cells (Fig. 6c; Supplementary Fig. 5c).
ATRA treatment remarkably reduced the binding of GFI1, TET1,
EZH2 and SIN3A, but not that of MLL protein, to the miR-22
promoter region (Fig. 6d). H3K27me3 modifications and RNA
polymerase II (RNA pol II) occupancy were significantly
decreased and increased, respectively, while H3K4Me3 modifica-
tions showed no significant change (Fig. 6d). Noticeably, the
enrichment of GFI1 to this region was diminished by ATRA to a
greater degree than that of TET1, EZH2 or SIN3A (Fig. 6d),
suggesting that GFI1 might be the primary effector of ATRA
treatment in regulating miR-22 expression. Consistently, knock-
down of GFI1 resulted in a dramatic increase in miR-22
expression (44 fold; Fig. 6e), associated with a significant
decrease in the binding of TET1, EZH2, SIN3A and GFI1 itself to
the miR-22 promoter region (Fig. 6f). Knockdown of expression
of TET1, EZH2 or SIN3A resulted in a 2–3-fold increase in
miR-22 expression (Fig. 6g), with no effects on GFI1 expression
(Supplementary Fig. 5d); only their combinational knockdown
could cause a similar level of increase in miR-22 expression
(Fig. 6g; Supplementary Fig. 5e) to that induced by GFI1
knockdown (Fig. 6e). As expected, the expression level of
WDR81 was not changed on knockdown of GFI1, TET1, EZH2
or SIN3A (Supplementary Fig. 5f,g). The above data suggest that
GFI1, TET1, EZH2 and SIN3A are all involved in transcriptional
repression of miR-22 expression; and when treated with ATRA,
GFI1 likely functions as the primary effector that facilitates the
binding of TET1/EZH2/SIN3A complex to the miR-22 promoter
region.
As TET1 is a methylcytosine dioxygenase8–10, we conducted
bisulfite sequencing analysis to investigate whether TET1 affects
the methylation status of the miR-22 promoter. The analysis
showed that the miR-22 promoter was hypomethylated in AML
cells, no matter with ATRA treatment or not (Supplementary
Fig. 5h). The hypomethylated status of the miR-22 promoter
region in various AML was confirmed by analysing the

Figure 7 | Therapeutic effect of miR-22-nanoparticles in treating AML. (a,b) Primary leukaemia BM cells bearing MLL-AF9 (a) or AE9a (b) were
transplanted into sublethally irradiated secondary recipient mice. After the onset of secondary AML (usually 10 days post transplantation), the recipient
mice were treated with PBS control, or 0.5 mg kg � 1 miR-22 or miR-22 mutant RNA oligos formulated with G7 PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, i.v., every
other day, until the PBS-treated control group all died of leukaemia. (c) NSGS mice49 were transplanted with MV4;11/t(4;11) AML cells. Five days post
transplantation, these mice started to be treated with PBS control, miR-22 or miR-22 mutant nanoparticles at the same dose as described above.
Kaplan–Meier curves are shown; the drug administration period and frequency were indicated with yellow arrows. The P values were detected by log-rank
test. (d) Wright–Giemsa stained PB and BM, and H&E stained spleen and liver of the MLL-AF9-secondary leukaemic mice treated with PBS control, miR-22
or miR-22 mutant nanoparticles.

 (Supplementary Fig. 5i). The methylation status of the miR-22
promoter
showed
no
significant
correlation
with
miR-22
expression level in AML (Supplementary Fig. 5j). These data
suggest that the hypomethylation status of miR-22 promotor
region does not lead to a high-level expression of miR-22 in AML,
and TET1-mediated repression of miR-22 transcription is
unlikely related to its methylcytosine dioxygenase activity.
The miR-22-associated regulatory circuit in AML. The above
data suggest that repression of miR-22 in AML is attributed to
both DNA copy-number loss and especially TET1-mediated
transcriptional suppression. Interestingly, among the nine AML
samples
with
DNA
copy-number
loss
of
miR-22
locus
(Supplementary Fig. 4a,b), the AML samples with both copy-
number loss and TET1 overexpression generally exhibited a more
significant repression of miR-22 expression than those with copy-
number loss alone (Supplementary Fig. 5k). Thus, those two
mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and can have synergistic
effect on reducing miR-22 expression.
Collectively, our studies revealed a previously unappreciated
genetic/epigenetic regulatory circuit in AML (Fig. 6h). In this
circuit, oncogenic fusion genes or gene mutants (for example,
MLL-fusions, AE9a and FLT3-ITD/NPM1c þ) function as the
‘drivers’. They promote the expression of TET1, which in turn,
through recruiting polycomb cofactors such as EZH2 and SIN3A,
represses the transcription of miR-22 by increasing H3K27me3
and decreasing RNA Pol II binding at the miR-22 promoter.
When AML cells are treated with ATRA, ATRA substantially
diminishes the enrichment of GFI1, a binding partner of TET1, at
the miR-22 promoter, and thereby inhibits the recruitment of the
TET1/EZH2/SIN3A complex to this region. In addition, miR-22
can also be compromised in its function by genetic mechanism(s)
such as DNA copy-number loss in a portion (7–18%) of the AML
cases. The inactivation of miR-22 results in the de-repression of
its critical oncogenic targets such as CRCT1, MYCBP and FLT3,
and thereby the activation of both CREB and MYC signalling
pathways, leading to cell transformation and leukemogenesis.
Restoration of miR-22 expression and function to treat AML.
To investigate the therapeutic potential of restoration of miR-22
expression/function in treating AML, we employed amine-ter-
minated,
generation

poly(amidoamine)
(PAMAM)
dendrimers (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b), an effective non-viral gene

effects48.
Nanoparticles
carrying miR-22 oligos significantly delayed AML progression
in both MLL-AF9 and AE9a-induced secondary leukaemic
recipients (Fig. 7a,b). Notably, at least 40% of the treated mice
seemed to be completely cured by the miR-22 nanoparticles as the
pathological morphologies in PB, BM, spleen and liver tissues all
became normal (Fig. 7d; Supplementary Fig. 6c). In contrast, the
miR-22 mutant nanoparticles exhibited no significant therapeutic
effect (Fig. 7a,b,d; Supplementary Fig. 6c). As expected, miR-22
oligos, but not miR-22 mutant oligos, significantly inhibited
expression of its critical targets (that is, Crct1, Flt3 and Mycbp) in
BM cells of the treated mice (Supplementary Fig. 6d). The miR-
22-nanoparticles showed no noticeable effects on blood cell
lineages (Supplementary Table 4).
We
then
tested
the
miR-22
nanoparticles
in
a
xeno-
transplantation model49. Similarly, the nanoparticles carrying
miR-22 oligos, but not miR-22 mutant, significantly delayed AML
progression induced by human MV4;11/t(4;11) cells (Fig. 7c).
The miR-22-nanoparticle administration also resulted in less
aggressive leukaemic pathological phenotypes in the recipient
mice (Supplementary Fig. 6e). Thus, our studies demonstrated
the therapeutic potential of using miR-22-based nanoparticles
to treat AML.
Discussion
It remains poorly understood how TET proteins mediate gene
regulation in cancer. Here we show that in de novo AML, it is
TET1, but not TET2 (a reported direct target of miR-22 in MDS
and breast cancer15,16), that inversely correlates with miR-22 in
expression and negatively regulates miR-22 at the transcriptional
level. Likely together with GFI1, TET1 recruits polycomb
cofactors (for example, EZH2/SIN3A) to the miR-22 promoter,
leading to a significant increase in H3K27me3 occupancy and
decrease in RNA pol II occupancy at that region, and thereby
resulting in miR-22 repression in AML cells; such a repression
can be abrogated by ATRA treatment. Thus, our study uncovers a
novel epigenetic regulation mechanism in leukaemia involving
the cooperation between TET1/GFI1 and polycomb factors.
Besides GFI1, it was reported that LSD1 is also a binding partner
of TET1 (ref. 50). Interestingly, LSD1 is known as a common binding
partner shared by TET1 and GFI1, and mediates the effect of GFI1
on hematopoietic differentiation51,52. Thus, it is possible that LSD1
might also participate in the transcriptional repression of miR-22 as a
component of the GFI1/TET1 repression complex.
We previously reported that TET1 cooperates with MLL
fusions in positively regulating their oncogenic co-targets in
MLL-rearranged AML14. Here we show that TET1 can also
function as a transcriptional repressor (of a miRNA) in cancer.
The requirement of TET1-mediated regulation on expression of
its positive (for example, HOXA/MEIS1/PBX3)14 or negative
(for example, miR-22) downstream effectors in leukemogenesis
likely explains the rareness of TET1 mutations in AML53, and
highlights its potent oncogenic role in leukaemia.
The aberrant activation of both CREB and MYC signalling
pathways has been shown in AML24–26,54,55, but the underlying
molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Our data suggest that the
activation of these two signalling pathways in AML can be
attributed, at least in part, to the repression of miR-22, which in
turn, results in the de-repression of CRTC1 (CREB pathway),
FLT3 and MYCBP (MYC pathway), and leads to the upregulation
of oncogenic downstream targets (for example, CDK6, HOXA7,
BMI1, FASN and HMGA1) and downregulation of tumour-
suppressor downstream targets (for example, RGS2).
In summary, we uncover a TET1/GFI1/EZH2/SIN3ABmiR-
22BCREB-MYC signalling circuit in de novo AML, in which
miR-22
functions
as
a
pivotal
anti-tumour
gate-keeper,
distinct from its oncogenic role reported in MDS or MDS-
derived AML16. Thus, our study together with the study of Song
et al.16 highlight the complexity and functional importance of
miR-22-associated gene regulation and signalling pathways in
hematopoietic malignancies, and may provide novel insights into
the
genetic/epigenetic
differences
between
de
novo
AML
and MDS.
Our findings also highlight the possibility of using miR-22-
based therapy to treat AML patients. Our proof-of-concept
studies demonstrate that the nanoparticles carrying miR-22 oligos
significantly inhibit AML progression and prolong survival of
leukaemic mice in both BMT and xeno-transplantation models.
Notably,
miRNA-based
nanoparticles
have
already
entered
clinical trials56. It would be important, in the future, to further
test the combination of miR-22-carrying nanoparticles (or small-
molecule compounds that can induce endogenous expression of
miR-22)
with
standard
chemotherapy
agents
(cytosine
arabinoside and anthracycline), or with the emerging small
molecule inhibitors against MYC and/or CREB pathway effectors,
to achieve optimal anti-leukaemia effect with minimal side effects.
Overall, our results suggest that restoration of miR-22 expression/
function (for example, using miR-22-carrying nanoparticles or
small-molecule compounds) holds great therapeutic potential to
treat AML, especially those resistant to current therapies.

 Methods
AML and MDS samples and cell lines. The AML and MDS patient samples were
obtained at the time of diagnosis with informed consent at the University of
Chicago Hospital (UCH), and were approved by the University of Chicago
Hospital Institutional Review Board (UCHIRB). All patients were treated according
to the protocols of the corresponding institutes/hospitals. THP-1, KOCL48,
MV4;11, MEF and HEK-293T cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA)
and maintained in the lab. The MLL-ENL-ER cell line was a gift from Dr Robert
Slany31. All the cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination yearly using a
PCR Mycoplasma Test Kit (PromoKine).
Preparation of AML and MDS samples. The primary AML and MDS samples
were stored in liquid nitrogen until used. Blasts and mononuclear cells were
purified by use of NycoPrep 1.077A (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway) according to the
manufacturer’s manual.
Human normal hematopoietic control cell samples. The MNC normal control
samples were isolated from normal BM cells purchased from AllCells, LLC
(Emeryville, CA) by use of NycoPrep 1.077A (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway)
according to the manufacturer’s manual.
Mouse normal BM cell population sorting. As described previously23, wild-type
C57BL6/J mice were used for the sorting. All laboratory mice were maintained in
the animal facility at the University of Chicago and the University of Cincinnati.
All experiments on mice in our research protocol were approved by Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Chicago and the
University of Cincinnati.
The long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs; Lin �Sca1 þc-Kit þFlk2-,
LSKF �), short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs; Lin �Sca1 þc-Kit þFlk2 þ, LSKF þ), and the
committed progenitors (CP, Lin �Sca1 �c-Kit þ) were enriched by lineage þ cell
depletion (EasySep Mouse Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Enrichment Kit;
StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC), and purified by FACSAria flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) sorting after 20 ml per test fluorescein
isothiocyanate-conjugated lineage (FITC-Lin) cocktail (including FITC-CD3
(17A2), FITC-B220 (RA3-6B2), FITC-CD11b (M1/70), FITC-TER-119 (TER-119),
FITC-Gr1 (RB6-8C5)), 5 mg ml � 1 phycoerythrin (PE)-Sca1 (D7), 1.5 mg ml � 1
APC-c-Kit (ACK2) and 20 mg ml � 1 PE-Cy5.5-Flk2 (A2F10) staining. Then,
Gr1 þMac1 þ myeloid cells and B220 þ B cells were sorted from BM cells after
2.5 mg ml � 1 FITC-Gr1 (RB6-8C5), 2.5 mg ml � 1 PE-Mac1 (M1/70) and 5 mg ml � 1
APC-B220 (RA3-6B2) staining. All fluorescent antibodies used were purchased
from eBioscience (San Diego, CA).
RNA extraction and quantitative RT–PCR. Total RNA was extracted with the
miRNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and was used as template to
synthesize complementary DNA for quantitative reverse transcription PCR
(qRT–PCR) analysis in a 7900HT real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). TaqMan qPCR assay was performed to validate the differential
expression patterns of miR-22 using commercial kits from Applied Biosystems
(Cat. no. 4427975). Sequences for the controls are: sno202: 50-GCTGTACTGACT
TGATGAAAGTACTTTTGAACCCTTTTCCATCTGATG-30; RNU6B: 50-CGCA
AGGATGACACGCAAATTCGTGAAGCGTTCCATATTTTT-30. qPCR with
SYBR Green dye (Qiagen) was used to determine expression of mRNA genes.
snoRNA202, RNU48, Gapdh or GAPDH were used as endogenous controls for
qPCR of miRNA and mRNA, respectively. Each sample was run in triplicate. qPCR
primers are available on request. For determining the miR-22 DNA locus copy
number, TaqMan qPCR assay was used as described previously57.
microRNA microarray and exon array assays. As described previously17,23, our
miRNA expression profiling assay of 85 (including 10 t(8;21), 9 inv(16), 9 t(15;17),
10 MLL-rearranged, 11 ( þ 8), 29 normal karyotype and 7 others) AML samples,
and 15 human normal BM samples was performed by Exiqon (Woburn, MA) using
the miRCURY LNA arrays (v10.0; covering 757 human miRNAs). The 15 normal
BM controls included six CD34 þ hemtopoietic stem/progenitor, five CD33 þ
myeloid progenitor and four MNC samples. In terms of patient samples, MNCs
isolated from the BM or PB cells of the 85 AML patients were used. The expression
values are log2 (Hy3/Hy5) ratios, which were obtained on the basis of the
normalized data where replicated measurements on the same slide have been
averaged. In addition, as described previously14,17,23, a total of 100 human AML
(including 30 t(8;21), 27 inv(16), 31 t(15;17) and 12 MLL-rearranged), and 9
normal BM samples (including three each of CD34 þ hematopoietic stem/
progenitor, CD33 þ myeloid and MNC samples) were analysed by use of
Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetirx, Santa Clara, CA).
The QC test and Affymetrix exon array assays were done in the core facility of
National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH (Bethesda, MD). Robust multi-
array average (RMA)58 was used for the data normalization with Partek Genomics
Suite (Partek Inc., St Louis, MI). The complete microarray data set has been
deposited in the GEO database under the accession codes GSE34184 and
GSE30285.
Among the above 100 human AML samples, 81 samples (that is, the In-house_81S;
including 29 t(8;21), 26 inv(16) and 26 t(15;17) AML) have been also included in the
Exiqon microRNA array assay21. The microarray data set of those 81 AML samples
has been deposited in GEO database under the accession code GSE27370.
Affymetrix gene arrays of mouse samples. As described previously17, a total of
15 mouse BM samples including 6 primary (including three each of negative
control and MLL-AF9) and 9 secondary (including three negative control and six
MLL-AF9) obtained from the in vivo mouse BM reconstitution assays were
analysed by use of Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetirx).
The RNA quality control, cDNA amplification, hybridization and image scan were
conducted in the Functional Genomics Facility of the University of Chicago.
RMA58 was used for the data normalization with Partek Genomics Suite (Partek
Inc.). The microarray data set of those 15 mouse AML samples has been deposited
at GEO database (GSE34185)
Affymetrix microarray assay of GSE37642_562S set. The GSE37642_562S set
(n ¼ 562) AML samples (including 30 t(8;21), 38 inv(16), 24 t(15;17), 38
MLL-rearranged, 6 del(5q), 16 del(7q), 15 inv3/t(3/3), 74 complex, 199 normal
karyotype and 122 others) were analysed by use of Affymetrix Human Genome
U133Plus2.0 GeneChips (n ¼ 140) or Affymetrix Human Genome U133A and B
(U133Aþ B; n ¼ 422) GeneChips. RMA method58 was used for data normalization.
The AML samples were collected by the German AMLCG study group. Part of the
microarray data have been reported previously44. The GEO ID of the entire data set
is GSE37642.
TCGA data sets. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) AML database22 includes
mRNA gene expression profiling data of 183 adult de novo AML cases (that is,
TCGA_183S; including 7 t(8;21), 11 inv(16), 17 t(15;17), 9 MLL-rearranged, 3
t(9;22), 22 complex, 78 normal karyotype and 36 others), which were generated by
use of Affymetrix Human Genome U133Plus2.0 GeneChips. Among the 183 AML
cases, 177 (including 7 t(8;21), 11 inv(16), 16 t(15;17), 9 MLL-rearranged, 3 t(9;22),
22 complex, 75 normal karyotype and 34 others) also have microRNA expression
profiles as detected by IlluminaGA_miRNASeq platform, and the mRNA/miRNA
profile data of the 177 AML cases were collectively referred to as TCGA_177S. One
hundred ninety-four adult de novo AML cases (including 7 t(8;21), 11 inv(16), 15
t(15;17), 9 MLL-rearranged, 3 t(9;22), 24 complex, 91 normal karyotype and 34 others)
with DNA methylation data as detected by Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip
were referred to as TCGA_194S. The mRNA/miRNA expression data and methylation
data were downloaded from https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/dataAccessMatrix.htm?

Cell culture and transfection. These experiments were conducted as described
previously17,23 with some modifications. THP-1, KOCL-48 and MV4;11 cells were
grown in RPMI medium 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% FBS, 1%
HEPES and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. MONOMAC-6 cells were maintained
in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine,
100 � Non-Essential Amino Acid, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 9 mg ml� 1 insulin and 1%
penicillin–streptomycin. Plasmids or siRNAs were transfected into MONOMAC-6
cells with Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V following program T-037, and THP-1 and
KOCL-48 cells following program U-001, using the Amaxa Nucleofector Technology
(Amaxa Biosystems, Berlin, Germany). Experiments were performed 48 h after
transfection.
For the ATRA-treatment study, THP-1 cells were seeded at a concentration of
0.4 � 106 ml � 1 and treated with ATRA (1 mmol l � 1) or vehicle control (DMSO,
0.001%) for 72 h before cells were collected for RNA analysis or chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays.
The MLL-ENL-ERtm cell line was kept in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
interleukin 3 (IL-3), IL-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF), 10 ng ml � 1; stem cell factor (SCF) 100 ng ml � 1; 10% FBS and 1%
penicillin–streptomycin. 4-OHT (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was added at a
100-nM final concentration as a 1-mM stock solution in ethanol. Cells were
collected for experiments at the indicated days after drug withdrawal.
The MEF and HEK-293T cells were kept in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing
10% FBS, 1% HEPES and 1% penicillin–streptomycin; HEK-293T cells were
transfected with Qiagen Effectene Transcription Kit (Qiagen) following the
manufacturer’s protocol.
All the cell lines were mycoplasma negative.
Lentivirus production and infection. All the plasmid for packaging lentivirus,
including pMD2.G, pMDLg/pRRE and pRSV-Rev, were purchased from Addgene
(Cambridge, MA). First, 0.5 mg pMD2.G, 0.3 mg pMDLg/pRRE, 0.7 mg pRSV-Rev
and 1.5 mg shRNA constructs, that is shGFI1 and control (purchased from GE
Dharmacon, Pittsburgh, PA) were co-transfected into HEK-293T cells in 60 mm
cell culture dish with Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). The lentivirus
particles were harvested at 48 and 72 h after transfection and concentrated with
PEG-it Virus Precipitation Solution (SBI). Finally, the lentivirus particles were

 directly added into leukaemic cells and these cells were washed with PBS 24–48 h
after infection.
Viability and proliferation assays. These experiments were conducted as
described previously17,23 with some modifications. For apoptosis and viability
assays, 48 h after transfection, cells were collected and seeded with requested
concentration. Cell apoptosis and viability were assessed using ApoLive-Glo
Multiplex Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) following the corresponding
manufacturer’s manuals. For cell proliferation assays, per million cells were
electroporated with 1.5 mg plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were
seeded in 96-well plates at the concentration of 10,000 cells per well. Cell numbers
were counted at the indicating days.
Plasmid construction. The home-prepared expression vector of miR-22, that is
MSCV-PIG-miR-22, was amplified by PCR using primers: forward: 50-GCCCTCG
AGTCTAGACTCCAGTTC-30 and reverse: 50-GGGGAATTCCTACTCCTCAAT
CCAG-30, and was subsequently cloned into the XhoI and EcoRI sites of the
retrovirus vector MSCV-PIG (that is, MSCV-puro-IRES-GFP vector; bearing GFP
gene), a kind gift from Drs Gregory Hannon, Scott Hammond and Lin He (Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). The other miR-22 construct,
the MSCV-PIG-miR-22_2 expression vector, was a gift from Dr Pier P. Pandolfi
(Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA)59. The MSCVneo-MLL-AF9 plasmid60 was
kindly provided by Dr Scott Armstrong (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA).
The MSCV-FLT3-CDS plasmid61 was a gift from Dr Michael Cleary (Stanford
University, Stanford, CA). The p1005-Crtc1 plasmid was provided by Dr Sheena
Josselyn (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada)62, and sub-cloned into
MSCV-PIG vector. The MSCV-PIG-MYCBP plasmid was PCR-amplified using
primers: forward 50-AAACTCGAGATGGCCCATTACAAAGC-30 and reverse
50-CCGGAATTCCTATTCAGCACGC-30. The 30UTR constructs of CRTC1 and
FLT3 containing putative binding sites for miR-22 were amplified by PCR from
human normal bone marrow mononuclear cells using the primers below:
CRTC1-30UTR: forward 50-GCCATTACTAGTCCCACCTGAGTG-30and
reverse 50-GCCATTAAGCTTGAGGACAGAAGC-30;
FLT3-30UTR: forward 50-GCCGCCACTAGTAGGAACAATTTAGTTTTAAG
G-30 and reverse 50-CGCAAGCTTGTGGGGACAAGAGTAACTTTA-30, and then
cloned into pMIR-REPORT Luciferase miRNA Expression Reporter Vector
(Ambion, Austin, TX). Site mutations were induced by PCR based on the sequence
shown previously for the miR-22 binding site(s) mutant of 30UTR of CRTC1 and
FLT3. The miR-22 promoter region ( � 1,100/ þ 55 bp, as was identified by Bar
et al.45) was PCR-amplified using primers: forward 50-AATAATGAGCTCAAGG
TCGGACG-30 and reverse 50-AATAATGATATCCTTTAGCTGGGTC-30, and
cloned into the SacI and EcoRV sites of the pGL4.15 Luciferase Reporter Vector
(Promega). The MSCV-Tet1 construct was as described previously14. All the above
insertions were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. ChIP assay was performed, as described pre-
viously14,17, with SABiosciences Corporation’s ChampionChiP One-Day kit
(Qiagen, Frederick, MD) following the manufacturer’s protocol, with some
modifications. Briefly, pellets of 5 � 106 cells were treated with fresh fixing buffer
(1% formaldehyde) for 10 min at 37 �C to crosslink DNA and proteins. The
reaction was terminated by the addition of stop buffer and incubated at room
temperature for 5 min. After cell lysis, the cross-linked chromatin was sonicated to
an average size of B500 bp and was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against
TET1, GFI1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), the N0-terminal
portion of MLL (MLL-N), the C0-terminal of MLL (MLL-C), H3K27Me3,
H3K4Me3, RNA polymerase II, EZH2, SIN3A or IgG (Abcam, Cambridge, MA).
Purified ChIP DNA was amplified by real-time qPCR using specific primers
targeting the CpG-enriched upstream region of human miR-22: forward: 50-GTT
GTTGGAGTCGTGAGTG-30; reverse: 50-CGCTCCACCTTTCCTTAAA-30; or
mouse miR-22: forward: 50-TGAATGGGCGGGAGTAA-30; reverse: 50-CCACGA
GCTGCGAATGAA-30.
Bisulfite sequencing. THP-1 cells were treated with 1 mM ATRA or DMSO
control for 72 h. Genomic DNA was extracted thereafter. One microgram of
genomic DNA was then applied to MethylCode Bisulfite Conversion Kit (Invi-
trogen) following the manufacturers’ instructions. After bisulfite conversion, 3 ml of
purified converted DNA was PCR-amplified using ZymoTaq DNA polymerase
(Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) following the manufacturers’ instructions. The PCR
products were purified using PCR purification kits (Qiagen) and sent for
sequencing. Primers applied in the PCR assays: miR-22 promoter: forward: 50-TTT
GTTTATTTTTGTTTTTTGGTT-30; reverse: 50-ACAACCCCTCCTTATTAAA
ATC-30; SLC43A2: forward: 50-TGTTTTGTTTTTATGGAGTGATTTG-30; reverse:
50-AAAAATAACCATAAACCATCCTTCC-30.
Luciferase reporter and mutagenesis assays. Luciferase reporter and muta-
genesis assays were conducted as described previously17,23, with some
modifications. Briefly, for transfection, HEK-293T cells were plated in 96-well
plates at a concentration of 6,000 cells per well in triplicate for each condition. For
the miR-22 targeting CRTC1 and FLT3 experiments, after overnight incubation,
cells were transfected with 20 ng of the pMIR-REPORT bearing the CRTC1 or
FLT3 30UTR or the 30UTRs with miR-22 binding site mutations, and 20 ng of
MSCV-miR-22 or an empty MSCV vector using Effectene Transfection Reagent
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. pMIR-REPORT Beta-
galactosidase Reporter Control Vector (Ambion) (1 ng) was co-transfected for
transfection efficiency control in all transfections. Cells were lysed and firefly
luciferase and b-galactosidase activities were detected using Dual-Light Combined
Reporter Gene Assay System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) 48 h post
transfection. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to b-galactosidase activity
for each transfected well. For the Tet1 targeting miR-22 study, HEK-293T cells
were transfected with 20 ng MSCV-Tet1 construct and/or 20 ng pGL4.15-miR-22
promoter. The succeeding luciferase reporter assay was conducted according to the
manufacture’s protocol (Promega). Each experiment was performed in triplicate
and repeated three times.
Co-immunoprecipitation analysis. For immunoprecipitation, cells were washed
with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 800 ml Nonidet P-40 solubilization buffer
(50 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mM
EDTA, 1 mM NaF, plus 10 mg ml � 1 aprotinin, 10 mg ml � 1 benzamidine and
0.2 mM PMSF). The following procedures are performed as described previously63.
GFI1 was precipitated by using protein A Sepharose beads coated with 400 ng
rabbit anti-GFI1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Lysates and
immunoprecipitation complexes were separated and detected by western blotting.
Packaging of recombinant retroviruses and CFA assays. Those experiments
were conducted as described previously17,23 with some modifications. Briefly,
retrovirus vectors were co-transfected with pCL-Eco packaging vector (IMGENEX,
San Diego, CA) into HEK-293T cells using Effectene Transfection Reagent
(Qiagen) to produce the retroviruses. BM cells were collected from a cohort of
4–6-week-old B6.SJL (CD45.1) donor mice after 5 days of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)
treatment, and primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells were enriched with Mouse
Lineage Cell Depletion Kit (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA). An aliquot of
enriched hematopoietic progenitor cells were added to retroviral supernatant
together with polybrene in a conical tube, which were centrifuged at 2,000g for 2 h
at 32 �C (that is, ‘spinoculation’14,17,23) and then the media was replaced with
fresh media and incubated for 20 h at 37 �C. Next day, the same procedure was
repeated once.
Then, on the day following the second spinoculation, an equivalent of 2.0 � 104
cells were plated into a 35-mm Petri dish in 1.5 ml of Methocult M3230
methylcellulose medium (Stem Cell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, Canada)
containing 10 ng ml � 1 each of murine recombinant IL-3, IL-6, and granulocyte-
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and 30 ng ml � 1 of murine
recombinant SCF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), along with 1.0 mg ml � 1 of
G418 and/or 2 mg ml � 1 of puromycin. For each transduction, there were two
duplicate dishes. Cultures were incubated at 37 �C in a humidified atmosphere of
5% CO2 in air. The colonies were replated every 7 days under the same conditions.
The colony-forming/replating assays were repeated three times.
Primary and secondary BMT. These experiments were conducted as described
previously14,17,23 with some modifications.
For primary BMT assays shown in Fig. 1e, normal bone marrow cells of B6.SJL
(CD45.1) mice were retrovirally transduced with MSCV-neo þ MSCV-PIG (as
control; Ctrl), MSCV-neo þ MSCV-PIG-miR-22 (that is, miR-22), MSCV-neo-
MLL-AF9 þ MSCV-PIG (that is, MA9), MSCV-neo-MLL-AF9 þ MSCV-PIG-miR-
22 (that is, MA9 þ miR-22) or MSCV-neo-MLL-AF9 þ MSCV-PIG-miR-22
mutant (that is, MA9 þ miR-22mut), through two rounds of spinoculation. Then,
retrovirally transduced cells were plated into methylcellulose medium supplied
with a set of cytokines to form colonies as described in the CFA assays. Seven days
later, colony cells were collected and washed, and then were injected by tail vein
into lethally irradiated (960 rads) 8–10-week-old C57BL/6 (CD45.2) recipient mice
with 1.5 � 105 donor cells plus a radioprotective dose of whole BM cells (1 � 106;
freshly collected from a C57BL/6 mouse) per recipient mouse. Notably, as the
colony cells were under selection of both G418 (1.0 mg ml � 1) and puromycin
(2 mg ml � 1) for a week, all donor cells (that is, the collected colony cells) must be
positive for retroviral transductions of both MSCVneo- and MSCV-PIG-based
constructs. Thus, MLL-AF9 and miR-22 (or miR-22mut) must be ectopically
co-expressed in MA9 þ miR-22 (or MA9 þ miR-22mut) donor cells, which actually
were confirmed by qPCR. Indeed, due to the potent inhibitory effect of miR-22 on
MLL-AF9-induced colony forming, we had to prepare more mouse BM progenitor
cells for the co-transduction of MLL-AF9 and miR-22. Thus, we plated them in a
larger number of dishes than what we did for other groups of co-transductions.
After BMT, all recipient mice were watched for leukemogenesis for a period of
200 days or till the end point that the mice developed full-blown AML or other
severe illness.
For primary BMT assays shown in Fig. 1g, C57BL/6 mouse (CD45.2) BM
progenitor cells were co-transduced with MSCVneo-MLL-AF10, together with
MSCV-PIG-miR-22 or MSCV-PIG vector. Cells were grown in RPMI medium
1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS, 1% HEPES and 1% penicillin–

 streptomycin, supplemented with a supply of SCF, IL-3 and IL-8. The cells were
selected with both puromycin and G418 for 7 days before transplantation. After
that, 1.5 � 105 donor cells plus a radioprotective dose of whole bone marrow cells
(1 � 106; freshly collected from a B6.SJL (CD45.1) mouse) were injected into per
lethally irradiated (960 rads) 8–10-week-old B6.SJL recipient mouse.
For primary BMT assays shown in Fig. 1h, C57BL/6 mouse (CD45.2)
BM progenitor cells or miR-22 � / � BM progenitor cells were retrovirally
transduced with MSCV-PIG-AE9a. The cells were selected with puromycin for
7 days before transplantation. After that, 1.5 � 105 donor cells plus a
radioprotective dose of whole bone marrow cells (1 � 106; freshly collected from a
B6.SJL (CD45.1) mouse) were injected into per lethally irradiated (960 rads)
8–10-week-old B6.SJL recipient mouse.
For secondary BMT assay shown in Fig. 2a,c,d, leukaemic BM cells isolated
from the primary leukaemic mice bearing MLL-AF9, AML1-ET9a (AE9a) or FLT3-
ITD/NPM1c þ were retrovirally transduced with MSCV-PIG þ MSCVneo (as
control; MA9-AML þ Ctrl, AE9a-AML þ Ctrl or FLT3-ITD/NPM1c þ-
AML þ Ctrl) or MSCV-PIG þ MSCVneo-miR-22 (that is, MA9-AML þ miR-22,
AE9a-AML þ miR-22, or FLT3-ITD/NPM1c þ-AML þ miR-22). Similarly,
retrovirally transduced cells were plated into methylcellulose medium supplied
with puromycin and G418 (for selection) and a set of cytokines to form colonies.
Seven days later, the colony cells were collected and washed, and then were
transplanted into sub-lethally irradiated (480 rads) 8–10-week-old C57BL/6
(CD45.2) secondary recipient mice via tail vein injection, with the dosage of
1.5 � 105 donor cells per recipient mouse.
For secondary BMT assays shown in Fig. 4f, leukaemic BM cells isolated from
the primary leukaemic mice bearing MLL-AF9 fusion were retrovirally transduced
with MSCV-neo þ MSCV-PIG (that is, MA9-AML þ Ctrl), MSCV-neo-miR-22 þ
MSCV-PIG (that is, MA9-AML þ miR-22), MSCV-neo-miR-22 þ MSCV-PIG-
CRTC1 (that is, MA9-AML þ miR-22 þ CRTC1), MSCV-neo-miR-22 þ MSCV-
PIG-FLT3 (that is, MA9-AML þ miR-22 þ FLT3) or MSCV-neo-miR-22 þ MSCV-
PIG-MYCBP (that is, MA9-AML þ miR-22 þ MYCBP). Again, retrovirally
transduced cells were plated into methylcellulose medium supplied with G418 and
puromycin (for selection) as well as a set of cytokines to form colonies. Seven days
later, the colony cells were collected and washed, and then were transplanted into
sub-lethally irradiated (480 rads) 8–10-week-old C57BL/6 (CD45.2) secondary
recipient mice via tail vein injection, with the dosage of 1.5 � 105 donor cells per
recipient mouse.
Preparation of Cy5.5-labelled G7 PAMAM dendrimers. G7 PAMAM
dendrimers obtained from Sigma-Aldrich were purified and fluorescently labelled
using an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of cyanine5.5 (NHS-Cy5.5) (Lumiprobe
Corporation, Hallandale Beach, FL), as has been previously reported64. In brief, G7
PAMAM dendrimers (38.7 mg, 332 nmol) were dissolved in 2 ml ddH2O, to which
NHS-Cy5.5 (3.75 mg, 3.32 mmol) in 400 ml DMSO was added dropwise, and the
reaction allowed to proceed under vigorous stirring for 24 h at room temperature.
Excess NHS-Cy5.5 was removed using an Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit
(MWCO 10,000, Millipore, Billerica, MA) at 4,000 r.p.m. and 4 �C for 20 min and
washing with ddH2O 10 times. Remaining product was re-dissolved in ddH2O and
lyophilized, resulting in G7-Cy5.5-NH2. All products were characterized by 1H
NMR using a 400-MHz Bruker DPX-400 spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin Corp.,
Billerica, MA).
Nanoparticle treatment in BMTor xeno-transplantation models. For secondary
BMT followed with G7-Cy5.5-NH2 dendrimer treatment shown in Fig. 7a,b,
leukaemic BM cells isolated from the primary leukaemic mice (CD45.1) bearing
MLL-AF9 or AE9a fusion were transplanted into sub-lethally irradiated (480 rads)
8–10-week-old C57BL/6 (CD45.2) secondary recipient mice via tail vein injection,
with the dosage of 1.5 � 105 donor cells per recipient mouse. After the onset of
leukaemia (when mice had an engraftment (CD45.1) over 20% and/or white blood
cell counts higher than 4 � 109 l � 1; for the MLL-AF9 and AE9a secondary
transplantation models, usually 10 days post transplantation), the recipient mice
were injected with PBS control, or 0.5 mg kg � 1 miR-22 or miR-22 mutant RNA
oligos formulated with G7-NH2 nanoparticles, i.v., every other day, until the PBS-
treated group all died of leukaemia.
For xeno-transplantation followed with G7-Cy5.5-NH2 dendrimer treatment
shown in Fig. 7c, MV4;11 cells were transplanted into NSGS (NSG-SGM3) mice via
tail vein injection, with the dosage of 5 � 105 donor cells per recipient mouse. Five
days after xeno-BMT, the recipient mice were injected with PBS control, or
0.5 mg kg � 1 miR-22 or miR-22 mutant RNA oligos formulated with G7-NH2-
nanoparticles, i.v., every other day, until the PBS-treated mice all died of leukaemia.
The maintenance and monitoring of mice. C57BL/6 (CD45.2), B6.SJL (CD45.1)
mice were purchased from the Jackson Lab (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) or Harlan
Laboratories, Inc (Indianapolis, IN, USA). NSGS (NSG-SGM3) immunodeficient
mice49 and miR-22 � / � (ref. 20) mice were purchased from the Jackson Lab and
were bred and maintained in house. Both male and female mice were used for the
experiments. All laboratory mice were maintained in the animal facility at the
University of Chicago and the University of Cincinnati. All experiments on mice in
our research protocol were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) of the University of Chicago and the University of
Cincinnati. The maintenance, monitoring and end-point treatment of mice were
conducted as described previously14,17,23.
Western blotting. Western blotting was conducted as described previously14,17,23
with some modifications. Briefly, transiently transfected MONOMAC-6 cells were
collected and lysed with RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific, BufferRockford, IL).
Proteins from the lysate were fractionated by electrophoresis through 4–15%
polyacrylamide gels (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA) and transferred to polyvinylidene
fluoride membranes using tris-glycine transfer buffer (Thermo Scientific). Blots
were incubated with IRDye 800CW-conjugated or 700CW-conjugated antibody
and infrared fluorescence images were obtained with the Odyssey infrared imaging
system (Li-Cor Bioscience, Lincoln, NE). 100-200 ng ml � 1 anti-CRTC1, anti-FLT3,
anti-MYCBP, anti-BMI1, anti-CDK6, anti-PGK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.),
anti-HMGA1 (Abcam) and anti-GAPDH (Thermo Scientific) antibodies were used
to detect corresponding proteins. Original scans can be found as Supplementary
Figures 7–9.
Target gene prediction. Putative targets of miR-22 was predicted by TargetScan
(http://www.targetscan.org)18.
DNA copy-number analysis of miR-22 gene locus in human AML. The copy-
number data of AML from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project were
downloaded from Broad Firehose’s analyses runs. The putative copy-number calls
were determined using GISTIC 2.0 (ref. 65). The latest GISTIC analyses data were
obtained using the following shell command: ‘firehose_get -o ‘GISTIC’ analyses
latest LAML’.
The.cel files of Affymetrix SNP 6.0 data for GSE21107 (ref. 66) and GSE23452
(ref. 67) were downloaded from NCBI GEO. The raw data were preprocessed using
PennCNV68. Then ASCAT69 was used to obtain the copy-number alterations. The
putative copy-number calls were determined using GISTIC 2.0 as described above.
Software and statistical analyses. The miRNA and gene/exon array data ana-
lyses, as well as qPCR data analyses were conducted by use of Partek Genomics
Suite (Partek Inc.), TIGR Mutiple Array Viewer software package (TMeV version
4.6; TIGR, Rockville, MA)70 and/or Bioconductor R packages. The miRNA-gene
expression correlation was analysed by use of Partek Genomics Suite (Partek Inc.).
The t-test, Kaplan–Meier method and log-rank testand so on were performed with
WinSTAT (R. Fitch Software), GraphPad Prism version 5.00 (GraphPad Software,
San Diego, CA) and/or Partek Genomics Suite (Partek Inc.). The P values o0.05
were considered as statistically significant. Significance analysis of microarrays,
embedded in the TMeV package (TIGR, Rockville, MA), was used to identify the
genes that are significantly (qo0.05; false discovery rate, FDRo0.05) dysregulated
in the MLL-AF9-mediated mouse leukaemia samples or human AML samples
relative to the normal controls. Pearson correlation was used in the analysis of the
correlation between miR-22 and candidate genes in expression. The list of
transcription factors that have evolutionarily conserved binding sites within the
miR-22 promoter region (that is, the adjacent upstream CpG island) was obtained
by searching UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/
hgTracks?db=hg19&position=chr17%3A1614689-1623188&hgsid=467686877_
