In Brief
Exposing C. elegans to pathogenic
bacteria early in life leads to a long-lasting
aversive memory. Memory formation
requires a tyramine learning signal that is
made by one group of neurons and
relayed to a second group of neurons
required for memory retrieval.

SUMMARY
Memories formed early in life are particularly stable
and influential, representing privileged experiences
that shape enduring behaviors. We show that
exposing newly hatched C. elegans to pathogenic
bacteria results in persistent aversion to those bacte-
rial odors, whereas adult exposure generates only
transient aversive memory. Long-lasting imprinted
aversion has a critical period in the first larval stage
and is specific to the experienced pathogen. Distinct
groups of neurons are required during formation
(AIB, RIM) and retrieval (AIY, RIA) of the imprinted
memory. RIM synthesizes the neuromodulator tyra-
mine, which is required in the L1 stage for learning.
AIY memory retrieval neurons sense tyramine via
the SER-2 receptor, which is essential for imprinted,
but not for adult-learned, aversion. Odor responses
in several neurons, most notably RIA, are altered in
imprinted animals. These findings provide insight
into neuronal substrates of different forms of mem-
ory, and lay a foundation for further understanding
of early learning.
INTRODUCTION
Although learning can occur at any stage of life, early memories
are especially robust and long lasting. An evocative example
is imprinting, defined as a process in which a sensory cue
presented at a specific time—the critical period or sensitive
period—subsequently gains unique access to ecologically rele-
vant behaviors. Imprinting was first described in newly hatched
birds such as chicks or geese, which form an attachment to
the first moving object they see (Lorenz, 1935; Nakamori et al.,
2013). It has since been described in a variety of animals, partic-
ularly in the olfactory system. For example, young Pacific salmon
form an olfactory memory of the natal stream that guides their re-
turn years later to spawn (Nevitt et al., 1994), and rodents and
other mammals show a strong preference for food odors that
they experience perinatally (Wilson and Sullivan, 1994). Each of
these imprinted behaviors is critical for an animal’s survival or
reproductive success. Among the questions raised by these
privileged memories are their sites of formation and retrieval,
and the degree to which their mechanisms overlap with those
of less specialized memories.
Learning is a universal property of the nervous system. Even
the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, whose nervous
system consists of 302 neurons, can modify its preferences for
sensory cues such as temperature, touch, tastes, and odors
based on experience (Ardiel and Rankin, 2010). As in other
animals, learning and memory in C. elegans depend on the
training regimen. For example, pairing an odor with bacterial
food in a single training session results in a short-term preference
for that odor, whereas pairing over multiple spaced sessions re-
sults in long-term memory that can last for 24 hr (Kauffman et al.,
2010; Torayama et al., 2007). Interestingly, pairing odors with
food in newly hatched animals can result in positive imprinting,
with increased odor preference in adults and even in the
following generation (Remy, 2010; Remy and Hobert, 2005).
C. elegans lives in a complex microbial environment, and its
survival depends on its ability to distinguish between nutritious
bacteria and pathogenic bacterial species that can infect and
kill the animal (Meisel and Kim, 2014). A substantial component
of its pathogen defense is behavioral. Within 6 hr of exposure to
a bacterial pathogen, C. elegans learns to avoid that bacterial
odor in an associative behavior that resembles conditioned taste
aversion, a widespread form of animal learning (Melo and Ruv-
kun, 2012; Zhang et al., 2005). This associative aversive memory
lasts between 12 and 24 hr. Neurons required for naive bacterial
preference as well as learned pathogen aversion have been map-
ped by laser-killing experiments (Figure S1A; Ha et al., 2010), and
molecules required for learning have been identified in genetic
studies and mapped back to this circuit (Meisel and Kim, 2014).
How these molecules change information processing in the ner-
vous system is unknown. Sensory neuron responses to bacterial
odors appear unchanged by aversive learning (Ha et al., 2010),
suggesting that the circuit changes occur in integrating neurons,
but the neural correlates of memory are obscure.
Neural circuits for learning and memory are studied in many an-
imals, but C. elegans raises unique questions because of its small
nervous system. How many forms of learning and memory can be
encoded by 302 neurons? How similar are they to each other and
to related phenomena in more complex nervous systems? Here
we show that pathogen training during the first larval stage results
inlong-lastingaversive memorythatis maintained intoadulthood.
We characterize distinct groups of neurons required for the for-
mation and retrieval of this privileged aversive memory, define
genes required for learning, and identify functional changes in

 neuronal activity associated with memory. Our results reveal sim-
ilarities and differences between imprinting and other forms of
learning, and they suggest a logic for imprinted aversive memory.
RESULTS
Pathogen Training Early in Development Gives Rise to
Long-Term Associative Aversion
Learned pathogen aversion is induced by exposing adult
C. elegans to pathogenic bacteria for 4–24 hr or by cultivating an-
imals with both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria (Chen
et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2005). In either case, the aversive mem-
ory lasts between 12 and 24 hr. We modified the learning assay
by hatching C. elegans eggs on a uniform lawn of the pathogenic
bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 (Figure 1A) and forc-
ing exposure to the pathogen for 12 hr during the first larval (L1)
stage. This treatment establishes an intestinal infection but does
not kill the animals (Tan et al., 1999). Antibiotic washes were then
performed to clear the infection (Figure S1B), and animals were
grown on non-pathogenic Escherichia coli OP50 until adulthood.

 When tested in an olfactory choice assay between PA14 and
OP50, animals trained as L1 larvae were significantly more likely
to migrate away from PA14 than naive animals (Figure 1B). This
shift in preference, measured days after training as a learning
index (naive choice index minus trained choice index), resem-
bled the shift in preference of adult animals immediately after
training with PA14 (Figures 1A–1C). No shift in preference was
observed in animals that had been exposed to non-pathogenic
P. aeruginosa PA*50E12 (Rahme et al., 1997) or starved for
12 hr as L1 larvae, suggesting that pathogenic infection is
required for learning to occur (Figure 1C). The progeny of trained
animals returned to the naive preference (Figure 1C).
To ask whether this long-lasting aversive memory occurs
during a critical period, we exposed animals to PA14 at different
developmental stages and tested olfactory choice in mature
(second-day) adults. Only exposure in the L1 stage for the full
12 hr resulted in stable learned aversion (Figure 1D). In agree-
ment with previous work, animals trained with PA14 as first-
day adults did not show learned aversion 24 hr later, nor did
animals trained as L2, L3, or L4 larvae. This long-lasting behav-
ioral response is called imprinted aversion to emphasize its
early formation, long duration, and the existence of an apparent
critical period in the L1 stage.
Imprinted adults appeared as healthy as naive adults, sug-
gesting that the altered behavior is not a consequence of
sustained damage from the bacterial infection or early starvation.
Their growth, locomotion patterns, and abilities to perform
behavioral tasks such as chemotaxis and local search were
similar to those of naive animals, although they had subtle
changes in quantitative behavioral assays (Figure S2).
The pathogenicity of PA14 is in part mediated by the toxic
translational inhibitor exotoxin A (ToxA) (McEwan et al., 2012).
Animals imprinted on an E. coli strain expressing ToxA avoided
the ToxA strain as adults in an olfactory choice assay with
OP50, showing that imprinted aversion can be induced by a sec-
ond strain (Figure 1E). ToxA-imprinted animals did not avoid
PA14, and, conversely, PA14-imprinted animals did not avoid
ToxA (Figure 1E). Thus, animals selectively avoid the bacterial
odors that they experienced during pathogenic infection, a
defining property of associative learning.
Formation and Retrieval of the Imprinted Memory
Require Distinct Neural Circuits
Olfactory chemotaxis in C. elegans is initiated by sensory neu-
rons that converge on common interneurons including AIB and
AIY, which synapse with each other and with downstream neu-
rons including RIM and RIA (White et al., 1986; Figure 2A).
Adult-learned pathogen aversion requires either AIB or AIY,
both RIA and RIM, and several sensory neurons including
AWB, AWC, and the serotoninergic neuron ADF (Ha et al.,
2010; Figure S1A). To ask whether the same neurons participate
in imprinted aversion, we examined strains expressing the
tetanus toxin light chain (TeTx), the gain-of-function potassium
channel UNC-103(gf), or a cytotoxic mouse caspase from cell
type-selective promoters. These experiments indicated that
AIB, AIY, RIA, and RIM were all required for imprinted aversion
(Figure S3A). Since our behavioral choice assays were different
from those in prior circuit work, we confirmed that the AIB::TeTx
strain was proficient in adult learning but impaired in imprinted
aversion in this assay, whereas RIM::TeTx was impaired in
both forms of learning (Figure S3A). Among sensory neurons,
AWB and AWC/ASE were required both for imprinted aversion
and for adult-learned aversion (Ha et al., 2010; Figure S3A).
Thus, imprinted aversion and adult-learned aversion have
similar, but not identical, neuronal requirements.
Neurons expressing toxic transgenes or subjected to laser ab-
lations are inactive throughout life. To distinguish the contribu-
tions of interneurons in formation and retrieval of the imprinted
memory, selected neurons were acutely silenced using the
Drosophila histamine-gated chloride channel HisCl1 (Pokala
et al., 2014; Figure 2B). C. elegans does not use histamine as
an endogenous transmitter, but absorbs exogenous histamine
to rapidly and reversibly silence neurons expressing a HisCl1
transgene. Silencing either AIB or RIM during the L1 learning
period abolished imprinted aversion in the adult, suggesting
that AIB and RIM are required for formation of the imprinted
memory (Figure 2C). Silencing AIB or RIM neurons in adults
during the olfactory choice assay spared imprinted aversion,
indicating that AIB and RIM are dispensable for memory retrieval
(Figure 2C). Conversely, imprinted aversion was robust to
silencing AIY or RIA neurons during the L1 learning period, but
impaired by silencing AIY or RIA neurons during the olfactory
choice assay in adults (Figure 2D). These results identify distinct
neurons required during learning and retrieval stages of im-
printed aversion.
Imprinting occurs while the nervous system is still developing,
but it was not associated with an obvious remodeling of neuronal
number, morphology, or fate among AIB, AIY, RIA, and RIM neu-
rons (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The AIY and RIA
neurons required for memory retrieval were examined more
closely with synaptic markers (Shao et al., 2013). Synaptic re-
gions of AIY and RIA were superficially similar in naive and im-
printed adults, suggesting that imprinting did not lead to major
structural changes in these neurons (Figure S4).
Imprinting Alters Chemotaxis Behaviors to the
Experienced Pathogen
The behavioral strategies that give rise to imprinted aversion
were examined through a quantitative analysis of chemotaxis
parameters. C. elegans approaches attractive chemicals using
a biased random walk, in which the frequency of high-angle turns
(pirouettes) increases when an animal moves down the gradient
and decreases when it moves up the gradient (Figure 3A; Pierce-
Shimomura et al., 1999). The turning bias is reversed in a gradient
of repellent (Yamazoe-Umemoto et al., 2015). We found that
naive animals turned less when approaching PA14 and more
when leaving PA14, as expected for biased random walk attrac-
tion, whereas PA14-trained animals expressed the reversed
pirouette bias appropriate for aversion (Figure 3B). This effect
depended on the learned association, as animals imprinted on
PA14 did not change their pirouette bias in response to the
non-pathogenic bacteria OP50 (Figure 3B) or the untrained toxic
bacterium ToxA (Figure 3C).
Silencing the AIY memory retrieval neurons with HisCl1
during the olfactory choice assay eliminated the PA14 pirou-
ette bias in both naive and imprinted animals (Figure 3D).
634
Cell 164, 632–643, February 11, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
 In addition, imprinting changed AIY’s contribution to basal
pirouette regulation, resulting in a stronger AIY effect in
chemotaxis assays and a weaker AIY effect during undirected
local search (Figures S2A and S2B). Thus, AIY neurons have
altered functions after imprinting, which include an acute
role in generating the reversed pirouette bias of imprinted
aversion.
Imprinted Aversion Shares Genetic Requirements with
Other Forms of Learning and Memory
The overlap between neurons required for adult-learned aver-
sion and imprinted aversion suggested that they might share
molecular components. Indeed, the serotonin biosynthesis
enzyme TPH-1 and serotonin receptor MOD-1 required for
adult-learned aversion were required for imprinted aversion as
well (Zhang et al., 2005; Figure 4A).
Glutamate is broadly employed as an excitatory neurotrans-
mitter in vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. Glutama-
tergic signaling and the vesicular glutamate transporter EAT-4
are required for touch habituation in C. elegans, among other be-
haviors (Lee et al., 1999; Rankin and Wicks, 2000; Rose et al.,
2003). We found that adult-learned aversion and imprinted aver-
sion both required eat-4, but glutamate receptors distinguished
between the two forms of memory. The glutamate receptor
GLR-3, which is expressed in RIA, was required for adult-learned
aversion and for imprinted aversion. However, the AMPA-type
glutamate receptor GLR-1 was required for imprinted aversion,
but not for adult-learned aversion, and the NMDA-type gluta-
mate receptor NMR-1 affected adult-learned aversion, but not
imprinted aversion (Figure 4A).
The cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a tran-
scription factor required for long-term memory in Aplysia,
C. elegans, Drosophila, and mice (Kauffman et al., 2010; Silva
et al., 1998). The C. elegans CREB homolog crh-1 was required
for imprinted aversion, but not for adult-learned aversion (Fig-
ure 4A). Imprinted aversion did not require SRA-11, a G pro-
tein-coupled receptor required for positive odor imprinting
(Figure 4A; Remy and Hobert, 2005). Although much remains
to be learned about the timing, neuronal site of action, and
specificity of these genes, it appears that imprinted aversion
has genetic requirements that overlap partly, but not entirely,
with other forms of learning.

 Imprinting Requires the Neuromodulator Tyramine in
RIM Neurons and the Tyramine Receptor SER-2 in AIY
Neurons
The RIM neurons release several neurotransmitters, including
the monoamine neurotransmitter tyramine (Alkema et al., 2005;
Figure 4B). Invertebrate tyramine and octopamine are analogous
to vertebrate epinephrine and norepinephrine, neuromodulators
that can act as learning cues (Tully et al., 2007). Synthesis of
tyramine and of the related transmitter octopamine requires
the tyrosine decarboxylase TDC-1, and we found that tdc-1
mutants were defective both in imprinted aversion and in
adult-learned aversion (Figures 4C and S3B). The tbh-1 mutants,
which are deficient in octopamine synthesis, had normal im-
printed aversion, suggesting that tyramine is the relevant
transmitter (Figure 4C). tdc-1 is expressed in RIM and RIC neu-
rons and in non-neuronal cells in the gonad (Alkema et al.,
2005). Imprinted aversion in tdc-1 mutants was rescued by ex-
pressing a tdc-1 cDNA from the RIM-specific gcy-13 promoter,
but not from the RIC-specific tbh-1 promoter, indicating that
tyramine synthesized by the RIM neurons is sufficient for
imprinting (Figure 4C).
Imprinted aversion in tdc-1 mutants was rescued by exoge-
nous tyramine during the L1 stage, when the RIM neurons

(A) A pirouette is a reversal coupled to a high-angle
turn. The bearing angle q is the animal’s direction
of movement with respect to the odor source
(here, PA14 lawn) before the pirouette. Each
choice assay has two bacterial odor sources,
which were examined separately (see the Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures).
(B) Normalized pirouette frequency of naive and
imprinted animals at different bearing angles with
respect to a PA14 lawn (left) or OP50 lawn (right) in
the choice assay. Naive event frequency was
compared to imprinted frequency at each bearing
angle; p values were generated by ANOVA with the
Sidak correction (*p < 0.05).
(C) Normalized pirouette frequency of naive and
PA14-imprinted animals navigating between a
novel toxic bacterium, ToxA, and OP50 in the
choice assay.
(D) Normalized pirouette frequency of naive and
PA14-imprinted animals navigating between PA14
and OP50 with AIY neurons silenced with HisCl1 in
the choice assay.
Pirouette rates were calculated from three to five
movies with 40–50 animals each and normalized to
average pirouette rates across angles.

were required, but not at later times
(Figure 4D, left). Direct administration of
tyramine during the L1 learning period
rescued imprinted aversion when RIM
was simultaneously silenced with HisCl1
(Figure 4D, right). The requirement for
RIM in
imprinted
aversion
is,
there-
fore, closely associated with tyramine
signaling in the L1 stage. However, L1 supplementation with
exogenous tyramine and serotonin was not sufficient to induce
imprinted aversion to non-pathogenic bacteria (Figure S3C).
C. elegans senses tyramine through the G protein-coupled
receptors TYRA-2, TYRA-3, SER-2, and the tyramine-gated
chloride channel LGC-55 (Donnelly et al., 2013; Pirri et al.,
2009; Rex et al., 2005; Wragg et al., 2007). tyra-2, ser-2, and
lgc-55 were all required for imprinted aversion, but tyra-3 was
not (Figure 4E). Among these, ser-2 was required for imprinted
aversion, but not adult-learned aversion (Figure S3B).
The ser-2 gene encodes multiple isoforms from different
promoters (Tsalik et al., 2003). A distal promoter fragment (ser-
2p2) driving a ser-2e cDNA rescued imprinted aversion in ser-2
mutants, but a proximal promoter fragment (ser-2p1) did not
(Figure 4E). Rescuing activity was narrowed down further using
an inverted Cre-lox (FLEx) recombination strategy to provide
ser-2 to subsets of ser-2p2 neurons (Figure 4F). Expressing the
Cre recombinase only in AIY neurons rescued learned aversion
almost as well as full ser-2p2 expression, whereas expression
in other ser-2p2-expressing neurons (RME, SIA, and AIZ) was
ineffective (Figure 4F). Thus, SER-2 in AIY detects the tyramine
produced by RIM, bridging the memory formation and retrieval
circuits for imprinted aversion.

 Imprinting Alters Neuronal Responses to Bacterial
Chemosensory Cues
How is imprinted aversion represented in the neural circuit? To
assess changes in functional activity, neuronal responses to
bacterial odors were examined in animals expressing genetically
encoded calcium indicators in AIB, RIM, AIY, and RIA. All of
these neurons respond to odors with calcium transients that
are likely correlated with neuronal activity, albeit with relatively
low temporal resolution (Chalasani et al., 2007; Gordus et al.,
2015; Hendricks et al., 2012). Each neuron was examined in
naive and imprinted animals presented with alternating streams
of OP50- and PA14-conditioned medium to imitate the sensory
experience associated with a choice between bacterial odors.
In the memory formation neurons AIB and RIM, calcium fell
after a transition from OP50- to PA14-conditioned medium and
increased after a reciprocal transition from PA14 to OP50 (Fig-
ures 5A, 5B, and S5A). Calcium transients were similar in naive
and imprinted adult animals, albeit with a slightly stronger AIB
response after imprinting. Therefore, although AIB and RIM are
not required for memory retrieval, they are still active and odor
responsive after imprinting (Figures 5 and S2C).
In the AIY memory retrieval neurons, calcium increased after a
transition from OP50- to PA14-conditioned medium and fell after
the reciprocal transition (Figure 5C). The average response in AIY
was significantly stronger in imprinted adults (Figures 5C and
S5B), identifying a second functional change associated with
memory.
The RIA interneurons have compartmentalized axonal calcium
dynamics that integrate sensory input and motor feedback (Hen-
dricks et al., 2012). In naive animals, average axonal calcium
levels in RIA transiently increased each time bacterial odors
were exchanged, rising immediately and falling within 2 s (Fig-
ures 5D and S6A). In imprinted animals, RIA calcium transients
changed in polarity to fall immediately after a switch from
OP50- to PA14-conditioned medium, and increased more
strongly after a switch from PA14 to OP50 (Figures 5D and
S6A). Examination of individual responses demonstrated a
systematic shift across the entire distribution of responses as
follows: after imprinting, a switch to PA14 elicited more calcium
decreases and fewer calcium increases, and a switch to OP50
had the opposite effects (Figures 5E and S6A). Sensory cues
such as bacterial medium elicit synchronous calcium responses
in both RIA axonal compartments (Hendricks et al., 2012), and
these synchronous events also reversed polarity to PA14 pre-
sentation after imprinting (Figure 5F). Alterations in RIA activity
were restricted to the bacterial choice context (Figure S6C)
and to the PA14 bacteria experienced during training (Figures
S6D and S6E).
To ask which changes in AIY or RIA activity correlated with
memory, we examined animals whose RIM neurons had been
silenced during L1 imprinting, precluding memory formation
(Figure 5G). These animals had the same increased AIY re-
sponses to bacterial odors as wild-type imprinted animals, but
their RIA calcium responses were not remodeled (Figures 5H,
5I, and S6B). Thus, imprinted behavioral memory correlates in
its circuit requirements with changes in RIA calcium dynamics.
DISCUSSION
C. elegans that are exposed to pathogenic bacteria in the first
larval stage form an associative learned aversion to the bacterial
odors that is maintained in mature adults. Based on its defined
critical period, odor specificity, and potential ecological rele-
vance, this behavior appears to represent a form of olfactory
imprinting.
Imprinted aversion in C. elegans differs from classical olfactory
imprinting in its valence. Classical olfactory imprinting drives
approach behavior, such as homing to the natal stream for
salmon (Nevitt et al., 1994), bonding between mammals and their
young (Lorenz, 1935), kin recognition in zebrafish (Gerlach et al.,
2008), and acceptance of imprinted foods (Wilson and Sullivan,
1994). Positive imprinting to odors experienced early in life also
has been described in C. elegans, although little is known about
its mechanisms beyond a requirement for the orphan G protein-
coupled receptor SRA-11 in AIY neurons (Remy and Hobert,
2005). Unlike positive imprinting, aversive imprinting does
not require sra-11 and is not transmitted to the progeny of
imprinted animals (Remy, 2010; Remy and Hobert, 2005). The
combined value of positive and aversive imprinting, encoded
by different mechanisms, may be considerable for an organism
like C. elegans, whose bacterial environment can be either
favorable or life threatening.
A Circuit for Imprinted Aversion
The formation and retrieval of the imprinted memory depend on
distinct groups of interneurons in a sensory processing circuit
(Figure 6). These neurons receive input from many sensory neu-
rons that detect pathogenic and benign bacteria. The AWC and
AWB neurons, which are required for imprinted aversion and
adult-learned aversion, detect both E. coli- and PA14-condi-
tioned media (Ha et al., 2010). The ASJ neurons detect PA14
secondary metabolites associated with virulence (Meisel et al.,
2014), and they also detect E. coli-conditioned medium, as do
numerous other sensory neurons (Zaslaver et al., 2015). The col-
lective activity of multiple sensory neurons allows discrimination
among bacterial odors, providing a substrate for olfactory
learning and memory (Harris et al., 2014).
Tyramine Neuromodulation Encodes a Learning Signal
The AIB and RIM neurons are necessary during learning but
dispensable for memory retrieval in the adult. The RIM neuro-
transmitter tyramine is also necessary for learning during the

 L1 stage, and tyramine can replace the requirement for RIM
activity. These results indicate that tyramine from RIM is an
essential learning cue.
AIB and RIM are acutely involved in sensorimotor behaviors,
so it was surprising that they were required only during learning.

 1986; Figure 6), and AIB and RIM are elements of a coupled
network of neurons that is active during most or all reversals
(Gordus et al., 2015). After imprinting, AIB and RIM remained
responsive to OP50 and PA14 bacterial odors, and AIB could still
drive reversals when optogenetically activated. Nonetheless,
these sensorimotor functions were dispensable during memory
retrieval, whereas AIY and RIA were essential.
Both imprinted aversion and adult-learned aversion require
tyramine and a second neuromodulator, serotonin (Zhang
et al., 2005). These modulators are necessary, but not sufficient,
for imprinted aversion. Although they may relay information
about pathogenic infection, they probably do not encode the
aversive unconditioned stimulus directly, as certain dopami-
nergic neurons do in Drosophila olfactory learning (Aso et al.,
2010). Instead, we suggest that the role of tyramine from RIM
in learning may be related to its role in generating variability in
sensory responses. RIM increases the coupling of AIB to the
reversal circuit and decreases its coupling to sensory neurons
(Gordus et al., 2015), effectively introducing variability in sensory
transmission to motor circuits. Behavioral variability is closely
allied with learning, a process that is best understood during
auditory-motor learning in songbirds. A young bird learns and
practices its tutor song using a specialized brain region called
LMAN that is not required for adult song performance (Bottjer
et al., 1984). The active generation of variability by LMAN is
essential for song learning in juveniles, and it can be re-engaged
in the adult to permit more limited song plasticity (Kao et al.,
2005; Olveczky et al., 2005). Like songbird LMAN, C. elegans
RIM neurons might generate sensorimotor variability during early
learning that gives rise to altered adult circuit function. We spec-
ulate that a requirement for variability-generating neurons at the
learning stage may be a general feature of sensorimotor path-
ways for long-term memory.
Retrieval of the Imprinted Memory
The AIY and RIA neurons are essential for retrieval of the
imprinted memory. The G protein-coupled tyramine receptor
ser-2 in AIY appears to recognizes the tyramine learning signal
from RIM, providing a molecular bridge between the neurons
involved in memory formation and memory retrieval.
Of the three tyramine receptors required for aversive learning,
SER-2 was required for imprinted aversion, but not for adult-
learned aversion. In motor neurons, SER-2 signals through Gao
to inhibit neurotransmitter release (Donnelly et al., 2013); how it
functions in AIY to affect imprinted memory is unknown. Both im-
printed aversion and adult-learned aversion require two other
tyramine receptors, LGC-55 and TYRA-2. LGC-55 is expressed
in the forward command neuron AVB and in head motor neurons,
and TYRA-2 is expressed in head sensory neurons, suggesting
that these neurons also could contribute to aversive memory
(Pirri et al., 2009; Rex et al., 2005).
AIY and RIA responses to bacterial odors were altered after
imprinting. AIY and RIA have common synaptic inputs, and AIY
provides synaptic input to RIA, so these functional changes
may be linked (Figure 6). Alterations in AIY were not sufficient
for memory, but changes in RIA calcium dynamics correlated
with imprinted aversion, were specific to the imprinted bacteria,
and depended on RIM learning signals.
RIA is a major integrating interneuron with inputs from multiple
neurons required for aversive learning and memory (Figure 6). It
is activated by sensory signals and by feedback from motor
neurons that guide head movements (Hendricks et al., 2012).
One possible model for memory is that RIA receives both excit-
atory and inhibitory inputs from bacterial odors, and imprinting
changes the relative weights of excitation and inhibition based
on odors that are present when RIM is active and tyramine is
released. Many neurons required for learning form both direct
connections with the RIA neurons (ADF, AWB, AWC, and AIB)
and indirect connections through AIY and other integrating neu-
rons (Figure 6). The convergence of these signals in RIA is a po-
tential site for the representation of the imprinted memory.
Imprinted Aversion and Other Forms of Memory
The existence of this long-lasting C. elegans memory raises
a number of questions for future study. One is the nature of

Imprinting Neurons AIB, RIM, AIY, RIA, and
Their Synaptic Partners
Synaptic strengths are based on the number of
chemical synapses from www.wormweb.org. The
four imprinting interneurons receive input from
many sensory neurons (in gray) that represent
different sensory modalities, and they send output
to motorneurons (in brown) to produce behaviors.
Many additional neurons are synaptically con-
nected to this network (Figure S1A; White et al.,
1986). Adult learning requires either AIB or AIY
neurons, whereas aversive imprinting requires both
AIB and AIY. Both adult learning and aversive
imprinting appear to require AWC, AWB, ADF, RIM,
and RIA neurons.Amongthe neurons shown, AWC,
AIB,RIM, andRIAareglutamatergic;AIY,SMD,and
RMD are cholinergic; ADF is serotonergic; RIM is
tyraminergic; and all neurons express one or more
neuropeptides. The SRA-11 receptor required for
positive imprinting is required in AIY.

 transient adult-learned aversion. These forms of memory have
overlapping, but not identical, genetic and circuit requirements.
Imprinting has a stronger reliance on the AIB and AIY interneu-
rons, which are individually dispensable for adult-learned
aversion (Ha et al., 2010). AIB and AIY are immediate targets
of sensory neurons, suggesting that imprinting engages early
steps of sensory processing. Imprinted aversion also requires
three genes that are not required for adult-learned aversion,
ser-2, glr-1, and crh-1. ser-2 acts in AIY, which is also the
site of action of the one gene known to affect positive
imprinting to odors, the orphan G protein-coupled receptor
sra-11 (Remy and Hobert, 2005). Thus, both genetics and cir-
cuit analysis point to AIY as an important mediator of imprinted
memory. The enhanced AIY response to odor input is not suf-
ficient for imprinted aversion, but the relationship between AIY
and pirouette behaviors is altered in several ways in imprinted
animals, suggesting that changes in AIY output are an element
of the memory.
The requirement for C. elegans CREB (crh-1) in imprinted
aversion is consistent with the requirement for this tran-
scription factor in long-term learning in many animals. The
site of CRH-1 action and its transcriptional targets may pro-
vide
further
information
about

mechanisms.
Notably, CREB is required for long-term appetitive olfactory
learning and long-term habituation in C. elegans as well as
aversive imprinting (Kauffman et al., 2010; Timbers and Ran-
kin, 2011); in each case, CREB is required for memory that
lasts at least 24 hr. In long-term appetitive olfactory training,
CREB changes the expression of over 1,000 genes (Lakhina
et al., 2015).
A second question about imprinted aversion concerns the
basis of the early critical period. During the L1 stage, the
C. elegans nervous system remodels its synaptic connections
and neuronal gene expression and incorporates 80 new post-
embryonic neurons (Hobert, 2010; Kage et al., 2005; Lesch
et al., 2009; White et al., 1978). The development of func-
tional connectivity may be modified by L1 experience during
imprinting. Silencing RIM led to subtle changes in adult RIA
calcium responses in naive as well as imprinted animals, a
hint that RIM activity during early development may affect the
maturation or refinement of sensorimotor circuits. A closer
examination of structural and functional connections in these
circuits, and the relative balance of sensory connections and
behaviors driven by different interneurons, might confirm or
refute this hypothesis.
A third open question is the site of memory storage in the cir-
cuit. Imprinted aversion led to changes in neuronal activity at
multiple sites in the circuit, including AIY and RIA memory
retrieval neurons, but also including the AIB neurons that are
not required for retrieval. This result highlights the fact that a
memory can be expressed at many sites in the nervous system
that are not active sites of memory storage. At the extreme, if
memory were stored in sensory neurons, it could lead to indirect
changes in the activity of any neuron downstream of sensory
input. The ability to manipulate the activity of individual neurons
with precision, while monitoring changes in circuit activity and
behavior, should allow a future identification of the essential in-
formation in the stored memory.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Standard nematode culture and molecular biology methods were used. A
complete strain list and Supplemental Experimental Procedures are provided.
Imprinting Training
Eggs from young adult hermaphrodites were obtained by bleaching (Stiernagle,
2006), placed on a nematode growth media (NGM) plate with pathogen or con-
trol OP50 bacteria, and incubated at room temperature (22�C). Eggs hatched
after �7 hr. After 19 hr (12 hr of post-hatching training), both naive and imprinted
L1 larvae were washed off the plate with 200 nM neomycin (Tan et al., 1999) in
M9 buffer, rinsed three times, transferred to an OP50-seeded plate, washed
again with neomycin solution after 24 hr, and transferred to a second OP50-
seeded plate where they were grown at room temperature (22�C).
Food Choice Assay
Fresh overnight bacterial cultures were diluted to optical density 600 (OD600) = 1,
and 20 ml of each bacteria suspension was seeded on a round NGM plate
(radius = 5 cm) and incubated at room temperature (22�C) for <2 hr. After
this relatively short incubation, chemotaxis is dominated by olfactory cues
rather than slowly diffusing water-soluble cues. To start the assay (modified
from Zhang et al., 2005), young adult hermaphrodites were washed from their
growth plate with M9 buffer, rinsed twice, and 100–200 animals were placed in
the middle of the assay plate, equidistant from the bacterial lawns. Assays
were incubated at room temperature for 60 min before being placed in 4�C
to end the assay. To test animals bearing transgenic exchromosomal arrays,
a COPAS large-particle flow cytometry sorter (Union Biometrica) was used
to collect the L4-stage animals that expressed the transgenic array 1 day prior
to the food choice assay.
Calcium Imaging and Data Analysis
Bacteria-conditioned medium was prepared on the day of the experiment by
filtering a fresh overnight bacterial culture in NGM buffer (with peptone) with
a sterile bottle top filter (Nalgene) into amber glass vials (EssVials).
Young transgenic adults expressing GCaMP calcium sensors (Tian et al.,
2009) were transferred to a fresh NGM plate, starved for 5 min, then loaded
into a custom polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chamber, which restrained the an-
imal to allow precise odor stimulation as previously described (Chalasani et al.,
2007). The acetylcholine agonist (-)-tetramisole hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich,
L9756) at 1 mM was used only during transfer of animals into the chip, but not
during imaging, to paralyze body wall muscles and keep animals stationary.
Alternating bacteria-conditioned media stimuli were delivered every 60 s
(AIB and RIM) or 10 s (AIY and RIA). The 60-s alternation was used in AIB
and RIM imaging to capture their slow calcium dynamics (Gordus et al.,
2015). Calcium signals were recorded at 10 frames per second using a 403
objective on an upright Axioskop 2 microscope (Zeiss), with Metamorph soft-
ware (Molecular Devices) and an iXon3 DU-897 EMCCD camera (Andor).
Imaging data were analyzed using custom scripts (ImageJ). MATLAB (Math-
Works) was used for subsequent data analysis and display as previously
described (Gordus et al., 2015). Bleach-corrected GCaMP fluorescence was
divided by the lowest 5% as a baseline value, and then divided by the maximal
value inthe trace toobtainthe normalized calciumresponse dF/Fmax for each an-
imal. Each animal was normalized only once for data taken throughout a full
experiment with many trials. Responses from multiple trials were averaged to
obtainameanpopulationresponseandSEM.Becauseofthe bimodalresponses
of AIB and RIM, only the trials in which neurons were in high activity states before
PA addition were averaged in Figure 5 (see Supplemental Experimental Proce-
dures). RIAcalcium synchrony was calculated as previously described as events
in which both axon compartments had time derivatives >0.005 (% s�1) (influx)
or <�0.005 (% s�1) (efflux) (Hendricks et al., 2012).
