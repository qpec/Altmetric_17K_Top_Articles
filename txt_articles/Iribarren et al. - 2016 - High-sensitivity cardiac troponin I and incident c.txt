ABSTRACT
Objective High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) is
a novel biomarker of myocardial injury and ischaemia.
Our objective was to ascertain correlates of hs-cTnI and
its incremental prognostic utility for incident coronary
heart disease (CHD) among older asymptomatic subjects.
Methods We performed a cohort study among 1135
asymptomatic control participants in the ADVANCE
(Atherosclerotic Disease, VAscular FunctioN and GenetiC
Epidemiology) study at Kaiser Permanente Northern
California and Stanford University, with follow-up
through 31 December 2014. Hs-cTnI was measured in
stored baseline (2002–2004) serum samples.
Results After a median follow-up of 11.3 years, 164
CHD events were documented. The most significant
correlates of hs-cTnI were black race, body mass index,
hypertension, LDL cholesterol and estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) (R2=0.16) After adjustment for
race/ethnicity, education level, diabetes status, ATP-III
Framingham risk score (FRS), C reactive protein and
eGFR, each 1 SD increment of log-transformed Hs-cTnI
was associated with 1.11 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.23,
p=0.04) increased hazard of CHD. The c-statistic
increased to 0.70 from 0.68 (p=0.16) and the category-
based net reclassification index was 18% (95% CI 8%
to 30%) after adding hs-cTnI to the model containing
the ATP-III FRS.
Conclusions Hs-cTnI conveys incremental prognostic
information for incident CHD among asymptomatic older
adults.
INTRODUCTION
Cardiac troponin I is a regulatory subunit of the
troponin complex that interacts with the actin thin
filament within cardiac muscle cells.1 Therefore,
cardiac troponin I, in conjunction with cardiac tro-
ponins C and T
, plays an integral role in the regula-
tion of muscle contraction. Cardiac troponin I
concentrations measured with conventional assays
are routinely used in the rule out of acute myocar-
dial infarction (AMI) and in the assessment of
30-day and 90-day prognosis among patients pre-
senting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).2
3
Recently,
new
generations
of
cardiac
troponin
assays (‘high-sensitivity or ultra-sensitivity’ troponin
assays) have been developed with limits of detec-
tion at least one order of magnitude lower than
current commercial assays.4 5
Prior studies employing high-sensitivity troponin
assays, capable of measuring troponin levels in the
general population or in patients with stable cardio-
vascular disease, have shown that elevated high-
sensitivity troponin levels are associated with struc-
tural heart disease, risk of future cardiovascular
events and mortality.6–10 However, the additional
predictive value for incident coronary heart disease
(CHD) risk that high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I
(hs-cTnI)
may
provide
among
asymptomatic
patients has been less studied. To address this
knowledge gap, we examined the distribution of
hs-cTnI, its correlates, as well as the complimentary
prognostic utility for incident CHD in an asymp-
tomatic population-based sample.
METHODS
Study population
The Atherosclerotic Disease, VAscular FunctioN
and GenetiC Epidemiology (ADVANCE) study was
originally designed as a case-control investigation
of genetic and non-genetic determinants of coron-
ary artery disease (CAD) and mode of CAD presen-
tation. For the present analysis, we used the control
subjects
with
no
prior
cardiovascular
disease
derived from the adult membership of Kaiser
Permanente Northern California, a large integrated
healthcare delivery system providing comprehensive
care to approximately a third of insured adults in
the
Greater
San
Francisco
Bay
Area.
Kaiser
Permanente members are representative of the local
surrounding and state-wide insured adult popula-
tion, except at the extremes of age and income
distributions. These controls have been described
in
detail
before.11
In
brief,
clinical
and
laboratory baseline data were collected between
December 2001 and January 2004 among 1287
healthy men and women aged 33–69 years (as of 6
January
2001).
Potential
eligible
participants
were identified in the health plan’s electronic data-
bases, after excluding those with a major chronic
disease or living over 50 miles from the research
clinic. Institutional review boards of the collaborat-
ing
institutions
approved
the
study
and
all
participants gave written informed consent prior to
enrolment.
Cohort derivation, study covariates and hs-cTnI
laboratory methods
All participants included in this analysis were free
of CVD at baseline and attended comprehensive
baseline clinic visits in 2002–2003 consisting of a
physical examination (weight, height and blood

 pressures by certified personnel and standard instruments and
protocols), completion of a self-administered questionnaire and
blood draw. Blood aliquots were banked at −80°C. W
e were
unable to measure hs-cTnI in 130 subjects because they did not
have stored serum specimens. Of the remaining 1157 subjects,
22 were excluded for missing variables required for estimation
of the Framingham risk score (FRS) resulting in a final analysis
sample of 1135 persons.
Information on age, sex, race/ethnicity, education level and
smoking status was self-reported. Body mass index was esti-
mated as weight in kg over height in m2. Diabetes status was
derived using fasting blood glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L, in combin-
ation with our health plan longitudinal diabetes registry.12
Hypertension was defined as self-report of hypertension or sys-
tolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure
≥90 mm Hg or using antihypertensive agents. Serum lipid levels
(total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)
and triglycerides) were measured in fasting serum using a
Beckman Synchron LX20 Analyser (Beckman Coulter, Brea,
California,
USA)
at
the
Stanford
Hospital
and
Clinics
Laboratory,
which
is
certified
by
the
CDC/NHLBI
Lipid
Standardization Program. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C) was calculated using the Friedewald equation.13 Fasting
blood glucose was determined with a hexokinase reagent kit
and insulin by radioimmunoassay at W
ashington University,
Saint Louis, Missouri, USA. Use of cholesterol-lowering agents
was ascertained using electronic pharmacy dispensing records
indicating an active prescription at the clinical examination date
and up to 6 months prior to the clinic visit. Glomerular filtra-
tion rate (GFR) was estimated using creatine levels extracted
from health plan databases and applying the Chronic Kidney
Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatine equa-
tion.14 Plasma C reactive protein (CRP) was measured using an
immunoturbidimetric assay on the Hitachi 917 analyser (Roche
Diagnostics—Indianapolis, Indiana, USA), using reagents and
calibrators from Denka Seiken (Niigata, Japan). Hs-cTnI con-
centrations were measured on serum specimens using the
ARCHITECT STAT high-sensitivity troponin I assay (Abbott
Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA).5 This assay has
within-laboratory coefficient of variation (CV) of 4.0% at the
99th centile and ≤0.1% cross-reactivity with skeletal troponin I
and ≤1% cross-reactivity with cardiac troponin T and troponin
C. The lower limit of detection (LoD) of this assay is 1.2 pg/
mL.5 Three men (3/577=0.5%) and 11 women (11/558=2%)
had hs-cTnI below the LoD. The 99th centile of a reference
population, using the same high-sensitivity assay was 23 pg/
mL.15 The ARCHITECT STAT high-sensitivity troponin I assay
therefore meets the two requirements for high-sensitivity tropo-
nin assay explicitly stated by the International Federation of
Clinical Chemistry: first, that the total imprecision (CV) at the
99th centile value should be <10% and second, that measurable
concentrations below the 99th centile should be attainable with
an assay at a concentration value above the assay’s LoD for at
least 50% (and ideally >95%) of healthy individuals. W
e esti-
mated the 10-year risk of CHD using the Adult Treatment Panel
III FRS equation that included age, sex, smoking status, systolic
blood pressure, treatment for hypertension, total cholesterol
and HDL cholesterol.16 W
e considered three risk categories,
<10% (low), 10–20% (intermediate) and >20% (high). W

CHD outcome
Incident CHD was determined from inpatient, outpatient, emer-
gency department primary or secondary discharge diagnostic
International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 codes consistent
with non-fatal or fatal AMI (410.x), angina pectoris (411.1,
413.x), CAD (414.x), coronary revascularisation procedures
(CPT4 codes 33510, 33511, 33512, 33513, 33514, 33515,
33516, 33517, 33518, 33519, 33521, 33522, 33523, 33530,

92995, 92996) or CHD death (ICD-9 codes 410–414 or
ICD-10 codes I20-I25). If multiple events occurred, only the
first one was counted and modelled. These codes have been pre-
viously validated by prior Kaiser Permanente of Northern
California (KPNC) studies.19
Statistical methods
W
e first tabulated the baseline characteristics of the cohort and
then examined the bivariate association between these variables
and hs-cTnI sex-specific quartiles. Differences across hs-cTnI
quartiles were evaluated with analysis of variance (ANOVA) (in
the case of normally distributed variables) or the Kruskal–W
allis
test (in the case of skewed variables) for continuous variables
and with the χ2 test for categorical variables. To ascertain inde-
pendent correlates of hs-cTnI, we used multivariable linear
regression with log-transformed hs-cTnI as the dependent vari-
able and all study covariates as independent variables simultan-
eously entered in the same model. The follow-up period was
determined as time from baseline to incident CHD, death by
any cause identified from comprehensive mortality databases,
termination of health plan membership or end of follow-up (31
December
2014),
whichever occurred
first.
W
e
calculated
age-adjusted incidence rates of CHD per 1000 person-years
with associated 95% CIs across quartiles of hs-cTnI using
Poisson regression. To examine the prospective relation of
hs-cTnI with incident CHD, we employed Cox proportional
hazards models with hs-cTnI as the main predictor (para-
metrised both as a standardised loge-transformed continuous
variable and as quartiles one through four with the first quartile
as referent), first adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity and educa-
tion level (model 1), then adjusting for model 1 covariates plus
FRS (model 2), and then for model 2 covariates plus diabetes,
CRP and estimated GFR (eGFR) (model 3). Formal a priori
effect modification of the association between hs-cTnI and CHD
by sex and FRS were examined by adding interaction terms
hs-cTnI by sex and hs-cTnI by FRS, respectively. To assess the
added predictive utility of hs-cTnI above and beyond FRS, we
plotted the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and
calculated
Harrel’s
c-statistic
and
integrated
discrimination
improvement (IDI) before and after inclusion of hs-cTnI.20 To
further characterise the incremental prognostic information pro-
vided by hs-cTnI, we estimated the category-based net reclassifi-
cation index (NRI),21 using standard FRS categories, namely low
(<10%), intermediate (10–20%) and high (>20%). Sensitivity
analysis was performed using a hard CHD outcome definition
that excluded angina pectoris and revascularisation procedures.
All statistical analyses were done using SAS V
.9.13 (SAS Institute,
Cary, North Carolina, USA) and with R software. The criterion
for statistical significance was a type I error (α) of 0.05.
RESULTS
The mean age of the cohort was 62 years, 49% was female and
about 38% was non-white (table 1). Half of the cohort had a
college or higher education level and 9% reported current

 smoking. The prevalence of diabetes and hypertension was 17%
and 44%, respectively, and 21% was on cholesterol lowering
medications. The median (IQR) FRS was 7 (12), range 0.04–
31.9.
Hs-cTnI concentrations (in ng/L) ranged from 0.9 to 141 in
men, and from 0.9 to 83 in women. The median hs-cTnI con-
centrations were 4.2 ng/L in men and 3.3 ng/L in women; the
75th centile cut points (to define the upper quartile) were
5.5 ng/L in men and 4.2 ng/L in women, and the 99th centile
cut points were 45.4 ng/L in men and 30.5 ng/L in women. The
distributions of hs-cTnI in men and women, in loge scale, are
depicted in figure 1. Overall, there were no statistically signifi-
cant differences in the distribution of education level, smoking
status or use of cholesterol lowering drugs across sex-specific
quartiles of hs-cTnI (table 2), but there were clear trends
towards worse risk factor profile with increasing levels of
hs-cTnI. The independent correlations of study covariates with
Loge hs-cTnI are summarised in online supplementary table S1.
The most significant ones were black race (ß=0.30; SE=0.06;
p≤0.0001), body mass index (ß per 1 SD=0.10; SE=0.02;
p≤0.0001),
hypertension
(ß=0.14;
SE=0.04;
p=0.0002),
LDL-C (ß per 1 SD=0.08; SE=0.02; p≤0.001), eGFR <60 vs
≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (ß=0.16; SE=0.07; p=0.02) and eGFR
60–89 vs ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (ß=0.09; SE=0.04; p=0.03);
all together explained 16% of its variance.
The median follow-up time was 11.3 years (range, <1–
13.0 years). In analysis using hs-cTnI as a standardised continu-
ous variable in loge scale, there was a significant, independent
linear effect of hs-cTnI on the risk of CHD: the model 1 HR
was 1.12 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.24), the model 2 HR was 1.12
(95% CI 1.01 to 1.24) and the model 3 HR was 1.11 (95% CI
1.01 to 1.23). Table 3 summarises the analysis of the association
between quartiles of hs-cTnI and risk of incident CHD. In
model 1, there was an almost threefold (95% CI 1.9 to 4.9)
increased hazard of incident CHD in the upper quartile relative
to quartile 1. Further adjustments for 10-year FRS and for
10-year FRS plus diabetes, CRP and renal function mildly atte-
nuated the strength of the association. No significant statistical
interactions were found between hs-cTnI and sex (p=0.88) or
between hs-cTnI and FRS (p=0.71), thus stratified analysis by
these variables is not presented.
The ROC curves for models with and without hs-cTnI are
shown in figure 2. The model containing the 10-year FRS but
not hs-cTnI had a c-statistic of 0.68; adding hs-cTnI increased
the c-statistic to 0.70 (p-contrast=0.16). The IDI was 0.0267
(p<0.0001). Adding hs-cTnI resulted in a category-based NRI
of 0.18 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.30). In sensitivity analysis excluding
angina pectoris and revascularisation procedures from the CHD
outcome (149 events; 15 events excluded), each 1 SD increment
of loge-transformed Hs-cTnI was associated (in a fully adjusted
model) with 1.12 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.24, p=0.04) increased
hazard of CHD. The c-statistic increased to 0.69 from 0.68
(p=0.23) and the category-based NRI was 0.17 (95% CI 0.06
to 0.30) after adding hs-cTnI to the model containing ATP-III
FRS. The reclassification tables for non-events and events are
provided as online supplementary table S2.
DISCUSSION
Supporting prior investigations,8 9 15 22 23 this biomarker sub-
study of ADVANCE demonstrates that circulating levels of
cardiac troponin I can be detected using a high-sensitivity assay
in
free-living
populations
without
prior
clinical
CVD.
Remarkably, in our sample of older controls subjects, 100% had
a measurable level of hs-cTnI. The 99th centile of hs-cTnI in
our sample (45 ng/L in men and 30 ng/L in women) were
higher than the 99th centile reported in a referential European
cohort (MORGAM)24 and in a sample of apparently healthy
volunteers in Minnesota.15 This may be due to the fact that our
cohort, even though was free of clinical CVD, had a consider-
able risk factor burden, for example about 17% had type-2 dia-
betes, 44% had hypertension and 21% were treated for
hyperlipidaemia. Also, a number of studies support the fact that
occult cardiovascular disease has a significant impact on the
hs-cTnI 99th centile.25 26
But more importantly, this population-based cohort study
demonstrates an independent association between circulating
ambulatory levels of hs-cTnI and subsequent non-fatal or fatal

 CHD among asymptomatic patients. More specifically, subjects
above the 75th centile were at about 2.5-fold increased risk,
irrespective of traditional risk factors, CRP and renal function.
Our results also provide evidence that consideration of hs-cTnI
resulted in improved discriminative capacity for CHD risk
assessment
above
and
beyond
baseline
10-year
ATP-III
Framingham risk, and in significant and clinically relevant
reclassification improvement. Another finding worth noting is
that black race was significantly associated with higher hs-cTnI
levels, and this was not explained by the differential risk factor
profile in whites compared with blacks (see online supplemen-
tary table S3). This disparity should be corroborated in other
multiethnic cohorts.
Our results are in agreement with those of Zeller et al27
among a general middle-aged Scottish population with regard
to incident cardiovascular risk prediction and reclassification. In
the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala
Seniors (PIVUS) study among elderly community dwellers in
Uppsala, Sweden, hs-cTnI levels were also higher in men than
in women and were associated with all-cause mortality in both
genders.28 The findings of our analysis are also commensurate
with those in the FINRISK cohort, where one (multivariate
adjusted) SD of hs-cTnI was associated with 1.18 increased
hazard of major acute coronary events and improved the
NRI by 5.1%.29
In the population-based Dallas Heart Study, circulating levels
of cardiac troponin T measured with a different high-sensitivity
assay was associated with structural heart disease (left ventricu-
lar wall thickening and dilation and left ventricular systolic dys-
function by cardiac MRI) and with all-cause mortality.9 In an

Heart: first published as 10.1136/heartjnl-2015-309136 on 30 March 2016. Downloaded from 
 analysis of the Cardiovascular Health Study of older adults
without known heart failure, baseline and change in high-
sensitivity cardiac troponin T was significantly associated with
incident heart failure and cardiovascular death.8 In the Bypass
Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation in T
ype 2 Diabetes
trial, cardiac troponin T concentration measured with a high-
sensitivity assay was an independent predictor of death from
cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction or stroke in patients
with both type 2 diabetes and stable ischaemic heart disease.
However, an abnormal troponin T value of 14 ng/L or higher
failed to identify a subgroup of patients who benefited from
random assignment to prompt coronary revascularisation.10 In a
recent cohort study of 6304 consecutive enrolled patients with
suspected ACS, those with hs-cTnI levels under 5 ng/dL had
very low risk of AMI or cardiac death at 30 days (adjusted HR
of 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.80).30
The strengths of the current study include the longitudinal
design, the inclusion of a diverse cohort, the comprehensive and
rigorous assessment of cardiovascular risk factors and the fact
that the sample was derived from a real world community-based
healthcare setting representative of the general insured popula-
tion. However, there are limitations to keep in mind: First, the
possibility of residual confounding by factors potentially asso-
ciated with elevated troponin and not controlled for in the ana-
lysis, for example left ventricular hypertrophy,22 or other
markers of left ventricular strain remains. Second, we could not
rule out other causes of myocardial necrosis, such as myocardi-
tis, although this is rare. Third, we lacked adequate statistical
power to examine the relationship between hs-cTnI and heart
failure, because only 32 patients (9 women, 23 men) had
inpatient or outpatient utilisation consistent with heart failure
during the follow-up.
In conclusion, our data provide support for the importance
of subclinical ischaemia or ‘troponin leak’ as an independent
risk factor for clinical CHD and inform the debate about the
clinical utility of hs-cTnI assessment for risk prediction among
asymptomatic subjects with no prior known cardiovascular
disease. High-sensitivity troponin testing may thus play a role in
screening for structural and heart disease, and for triggering
more aggressive primary prevention. This represents a shift in
paradigm from using troponin as a diagnostic tool in the acute
setting to using it as another tool in primary prevention.
Further research is needed to establish optimal cut-off thresh-
olds for risk stratification, along with whether modification of
hs-cTnI levels improves clinical outcomes.
Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
Cardiac troponin I, a marker of myocardial ischaemia, is
traditionally used for the clinical diagnosis of acute myocardial
infarction (AMI). Cardiac troponin measured with contemporary
assays with improved sensitivity has been shown to have
prognostic value for future risk of AMI in the context of
unstable angina and stable coronary disease.
What might this study add?
The findings of the present study extend earlier reports of
prognostic usefulness of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI)
in patients with AMI or stable coronary disease to asymptomatic
persons. In particular, hs-cTnI level in the top quartile (>5.5 ng/L in
men; 4.2 ng/L in women) was independently associated with 2.5
increased hazard of coronary heart disease. Furthermore, the
category-based net reclassification index was 18% (95% CI 8% to
30%) after adding hs-cTnI to the model containing the ATP-III
Framingham risk score.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
Findings from the study could help shift the cardiac troponin I
paradigm from diagnostic utility in the acute setting to the
realm of primary prevention at the population level.
