A
bdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a complex multifac-
torial disease associated with increased morbidity and 
mortality.1,2 The prevalence of AAA increases with age and 
affects ≤2% of men aged ≥65 years.3 Emerging evidence sug-
gests that AAA is a focal representation of a systemic disease 
with a distinct inflammatory component, rather than a mere 
consequence of atherosclerosis.4–7 Chronic inflammation in the 
aortic wall is crucial for AAA formation, and recent evidence 
has shown striking similarities between central inflammatory 
pathways involved in AAA and those occurring in psoriasis, a 
prevalent chronic inflammatory disease, with apparent pivotal 
roles of T-helper-17 cells and interleukin-17 in both condi-
tions.8–12 In view of these overlapping inflammatory pathways 
and an established increased risk of atherosclerotic disease in 
patients with psoriasis, it seems plausible that patients with 
psoriasis may also have increased risk of AAA.13,14 Although 
limited case series have reported an increased risk of AAA in 
some other autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthri-
tis and systemic lupus erythematosus, no large-scale studies 
have explored the potential association between AAA and pso-
riasis.15,16 Therefore, we conducted a retrospective cohort study 
by using Danish national registers to investigate the risk of AAA 
in patients with psoriasis compared with the general population.

Objective—Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a complex multifactorial disease associated with a high morbidity and 
mortality. Increased inflammation including T-helper 17 cell–mediated effects has been implicated in AAA pathogenesis. 
Psoriasis is considered to be a T-helper 17-driven chronic inflammatory disease and in view of potentially overlapping 
inflammatory mechanisms, we investigated the risk of AAA in patients with psoriasis in a nationwide cohort.
Approach and Results—The study comprised all Danish residents aged ≥18 years followed up from January 1, 1997, until 
diagnosis of AAA, December 31, 2011, migration or death. Information on comorbidity, concomitant medication, and 
socioeconomic status was identified by individual-level linkage of administrative registers. Incidence rates for AAA were 
calculated and incidence rate ratios adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity, medications, socioeconomic status, and smoking 
were estimated in Poisson regression models. A total of 5 495  203 subjects were eligible for analysis. During the study 
period, we identified 59 423 patients with mild psoriasis and 11 566 patients with severe psoriasis. The overall incidence 
rates of AAA were 3.72, 7.30, and 9.87 per 10 000 person-years for the reference population (23 696 cases), mild psoriasis 
(240 cases), and severe psoriasis (50 cases), respectively. The corresponding adjusted incidence rate ratios for AAA were 
increased in patients with psoriasis with incidence rate ratios of 1.20 (95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.39) and 1.67 
(confidence interval, 1.21–2.32) for subjects with mild and severe disease, respectively.
Conclusions—In a nationwide cohort, psoriasis was associated with a disease severity-dependent increased risk of AAA. 
The mechanisms and consequences of this novel finding require further investigation.

with a history of psoriasis (n=14 352) and AAA (n=5318) were 
excluded at the study start. During follow-up, we identified a 
total of 59 423 subjects with mild psoriasis and 11 566 with 
severe psoriasis. These patients were compared with the ref-
erence population of 5 404 544 individuals. During the study 
period, 23 986 patients were diagnosed with AAA. A flowchart 
of the study population is illustrated in the Figure, and base-
line characteristics for the study population are presented in 
Table 1.
Risk of AAA in Patients With Psoriasis
The results showed a disease–severity–dependent asso-
ciation between psoriasis and AAA (Table 2). The overall 
incidence rates (IRs) of AAA were 3.72, 7.30, and 9.87 per 
10 000 person-years for the reference population (23 696 
cases [mean follow-up, 14.4 years]), mild psoriasis (240 
cases [mean follow-up, 5.7 years]), and severe psoriasis 
(50 cases [mean follow-up, 5.7 years]; Table 3). The mul-
tivariable and time-dependent Poisson regression analyses, 
adjusted for age, sex, and calendar year showed increased 
risk of AAA in patients with psoriasis when compared with 
the reference population with IR ratio (IRR) of 1.36 (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.19–1.54) and IRR 2.00 (95% 
CI, 1.51–2.64) for mild and severe psoriasis, respectively. 
The risk associated with psoriasis remained significant in 
the fully adjusted statistical models controlling for age, 
sex, calendar year, comorbidity, concomitant medications, 
socioeconomic status, and smoking history with IRRs of 
1.20 (95% CI, 1.03–1.39) for mild and 1.67 (CI 1.21–2.32) 
for severe psoriasis (Table 2).
Sensitivity Analyses
Censoring of patients who developed atherosclerotic disease 
during the study and exclusion of patients with atherosclerotic 
disease before the study start did not alter the risk of AAA in 
psoriasis patients (Table 2). With the use of the more liberal 
criteria for psoriasis, we identified 88 910 patients with mild 
and 23 059 patients with severe psoriasis. The results in this 
analysis were similar to the primary analyses with increased 
IRRs for AAA in patients with mild (IRR, 1.41 [95% CI, 
1.26–1.57]) and severe (IRR, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.35–2.03]) 
psoriasis. When we adjusted for comorbidity that was con-
tinuously updated throughout the study period, the results 
for severe disease remained comparable with those of the 
primary analyses with IRR of 1.12 (95% CI, 1.00–1.27) for 
mild psoriasis and IRR of 1.67 (95% CI 1.21–2.32) for severe 
psoriasis. The additional analysis to assess the risk of AAA in 
patients with osteoarthritis showed no significant association 
(IRRs, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.99–1.18]) between these 2 diseases. In 
line with our primary results, supplementary analyses to esti-
mate risk of ruptured AAA in patients with psoriasis yielded 
increased IRRs for mild (IRR, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.21–2.12]) and 
severe (IRR, 1.94 [95% CI, 1.01–3.36]) psoriasis. The IRs 
per 10 000 person-years of undergoing surgery for AAA were 
estimated to be 3.03, 7.73, and 8.09 for the reference popula-
tion (n=22 455), mild psoriasis (n=254), and severe psoriasis 
(n=41), respectively.
Discussion
In this retrospective cohort study of the Danish population, 
we found an increased risk of AAA in patients with psoria-
sis, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. 
Notably, the observed risk increased with increasing severity 
of psoriasis. The results were supported by the sensitivity 
analyses. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess 
the risk of AAA in patients with psoriasis in a nationwide 
setting. These results may warrant the need for increased 
awareness on higher risk of AAA in patients with severe 
psoriasis.
Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory dis-
ease associated with cardiometabolic comorbidities.13,14,17,18 
Although it is well-established that psoriasis is an indepen-
dent risk factor for atherosclerotic disease and persistent 
systemic inflammation is thought to play a contributory role, 
the risk of AAA in patients with psoriasis has not previously 
been investigated.13,19,20 AAA is a common and often asymp-
tomatic disease characterized by progressive localized dila-
tation of the abdominal aorta with risk of rupture and fatal 
outcomes.21 Several studies have found a positive correlation 
between cardiovascular disease and AAA, and there is signifi-
cant overlap of risk factors for atherosclerotic and AAA (eg, 
male sex, smoking, and a family history) with frequent coexis-
tence of the 2 diseases.22–24 However, the traditional view that 
atherosclerotic disease is the primary driving factor for the 
development of AAA has been reviewed, and contemporary

data suggest that atherosclerosis is not the casual factor for 
AAA.25–28 Indeed, the pathogenesis and progression of AAA 
are considered to be a multifactorial process that comprises, 
for example, inflammation, matrix degradation, thrombo-
sis, increased biomechanical aortic wall stress, and a host of 
associated mediator molecules.1,2,29 Evidence has indicated 
that systemic levels of inflammatory markers, eg, C-reactive 
protein and tumor necrosis factor-α, are increased in patients 
with AAA and other chronic inflammatory diseases includ-
ing psoriasis.9,30 Furthermore, a central pathogenic role for 
tumor necrosis factor has been suggested for both AAA and 
psoriasis, and more specifically, recent studies have indicated 
that T-helper-17 cells and interleukin-17 can be of pivotal 
importance in the inflammatory pathogenesis of AAA, as was 
established long ago for psoriasis.8,11,31,32 Also, hemodynamic 
forces and segmental aortic stiffening probably contribute to 
AAA development, and in patients with psoriasis, increased 
arterial stiffness is associated with systemic inflammation.33,34 
Moreover, anti–tumor necrosis factor therapy can attenu-
ate AAA formation in a murine model, and in subjects with 
psoriasis, these agents decrease aortic stiffness and endothe-
lial dysfunction along with their amelioration of psoriatic 
lesions.35–37 Taken together, these data support the notion that 
shared inflammatory mechanisms contribute to the psoriasis 
severity-dependent increased risk of AAA observed in the 
current study. This finding clearly requires independent rep-
lication and the clinical consequences are unclear at present, 
eg, whether patients with psoriasis should undergo increased 
ultrasonic screening for AAA, and whether anti–tumor necro-
sis factor and other anti-inflammatory treatment of psoriasis 
may reduce the risk of AAA.

studies are susceptible to changes in registration of the data 
over time, eg, International Classification of Diseases cod-
ing practices. However, in Danish National Patient Registry, 
established International Classification of Diseases codes 
have been used since 1978 and the Danish Health Authorities 
and speciality associations continuously monitor registration 
practices, with no major alterations or administrative changes 
of coding practices relevant to our study occurring during the 
1997 to 2011 study period.38,39 Increased diagnostic activity 
after the diagnosis of psoriasis increases the risk of surveil-
lance bias and such effects may not have been captured by 
our adjustments for important covariates including concomi-
tant medication and comorbidity, and even in the sensitivity 
analyses, respectively. Moreover, we used the third hospital 
diagnosis as classification of severe psoriasis, and although 
results of our sensitivity analyses (severe psoriasis classified 
by first hospital diagnosis) generally were in agreement with 
our primary findings, the validity of hospitalization numbers 
for assessment of psoriasis severity has not been formally 
investigated.
AAA is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally 
as a result of screening. Of note, our group has previously 
validated the AAA diagnoses used in the present study with 
an overall predictive value of 89%. In 90% of these cases, the 
diagnoses were established by imaging techniques including 
ultrasound examination and computer tomographic scans.40 
Nevertheless, an element of residual confounding related to 
our approach with identification of exposures and end points 
based on hospital diagnoses cannot be ruled out. Also, our 
method of identifying mild psoriasis by the use of claimed 
prescriptions of vitamin D derivatives cannot be extrapolated 
to patients who may have received other topical therapies 
or ultraviolet phototherapy, in private dermatology clinics. 
However, we have validated this method in a previous study, 
where we assessed hospital records of 155 randomly selected 
patients, who were diagnosed with psoriasis by a hospital der-
matologist. In this validation analysis, vitamin D derivatives 
were found to be the preferred first-line treatment for 73% of 
the patients with psoriasis.41 Although the results cannot be 
generalized to the patients who were not captured by our cri-
teria for mild psoriasis, these patients would have been mis-
classified as controls and hence bias our estimates toward the 
null hypothesis. Also, given the large sample size, the impact 
of such misclassification is likely to be small.41 Furthermore, 
the registries used in the study lacked information on impor-
tant clinical parameters such as smoking status. Therefore, 
as a proxy for smoking, we used information on diagnoses 
of smoking, tobacco use, chronic obstructive lung disease, 
lung cancer, and pharmacological treatment for smoking 
cessation. Although this method is likely to have captured 
some of the effect in the analyses, it is an indirect approxima-
tion of smoking status and the results should be interpreted 
accordingly.42 Finally, the Danish population is primarily 
of Northern European decent, and extrapolation to other 
nationalities should be performed with caution. Because of 
the observational design of our study, we cannot determine 
causality.
The study strengths include use of nationwide prospec-
tively recorded data with limited loss to follow-up, adjust-
ment for important covariates, and use of validated measures 
of exposures and outcomes, respectively. The Danish tax 
financed healthcare system ensures free access to medical 
care to all citizens, which minimized the risk of selection bias 
attributed to, eg, age, sex, health insurance, and socioeco-
nomic status. Also, the exclusion of subjects with a history 
of psoriasis and AAA at the baseline provided a more precise 
allocation of time at risk.
Conclusion
The results of the present study indicate a disease severity-
dependent increased risk of AAA in patients with psoriasis. 
These findings add importantly to current evidence of pso-
riasis as a clinically relevant risk factor for cardiovascular 
disease and may require increased focus on heightened risk 
of AAA in patients with psoriasis. Further research is war-
ranted to delineate the mechanisms and consequences of this 
association.

The present study attempts to investigate the risk of abdominal aortic aneurysms in patients with psoriasis by using nationwide data. The 
results show that psoriasis severity is linked with increased risk of abdominal aortic aneurysms independent of the conventional risk factors. 
These data add significantly to the foregoing evidence with respect to the relationship of cardiovascular disease and psoriasis. The results 
extend the need of further research to understand the molecular mechanisms of how skin severity promote vascular inflammation and even-
tually lead to augmented cardiovascular disease burden in these patients. Nevertheless, these results may warrant the need for increased 
awareness on higher risk of aortic abdominal aneurysms in patients with severe psoriasis.
