June 23, 2016; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00117.2016.—Recently, we
documented age-related attenuation of efferent drive to contracting
skeletal muscle. It remains elusive if this indication of reduced muscle
strength is present with lifelong strength training. For this purpose, we
examined evoked potentials in the calf muscles of 11 [71 � 4 (SD) yr]
strength-trained master athletes (MA) contrasted with 10 (71 � 4 yr)
sedentary (SO) and 11 (73 � 6 yr) recreationally active (AO) old
subjects, as well as 9 (22 � 2 yr) young controls. As expected, MA
had higher leg press maximal strength (MA, 185 � 32 kg; AO, 128 �
15 kg; SO, 106 � 11 kg; young, 147 � 22 kg, P � 0.01) and rate of
force development (MA, 5,588 � 2,488 N/s; AO, 2,156 � 1,100 N/s;
SO, 2,011 � 825 N/s; young, 3,663 � 1,140 N/s, P � 0.05) than the
other groups. MA also exhibited higher musculus soleus normalized V
waves during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) [maximal V
wave amplitude/maximal M wave during MVC (Vsup/Msup); 0.28 �
0.15] than AO (0.13 � 0.06, P � 0.01) and SO (0.11 � 0.05, P �
0.01), yet lower than young (0.45 � 0.12, P � 0.01). No differences
were apparent between the old groups in H reflex recorded at rest or
during MVC [maximal H reflex amplitude/maximal M wave during
rest (Hmax/Mmax); maximal H reflex amplitude during MVC/maximal
M wave during MVC (Hsup/Msup)], and all were lower (P � 0.01)
than young. MA (34.4 � 2.1 ms) had shorter (P � 0.05) H reflex
latency compared with AO (36.4 � 3.7 ms) and SO (37.3 � 3.2 ms),
but longer (P � 0.01) than young (30.7 � 2.0 ms). Using interpolated
twitch analysis, MA (89 � 7%) had plantar flexion voluntary activa-
tion similar to young (90 � 6%), and this was higher (P � 0.05), or
tended to be higher (P � 0.06–0.09), than SO (83 � 10%) and AO
(84 � 5%). These observations suggest that lifelong strength training
has a protective effect against age-related attenuation of efferent drive.
In contrast, no beneficial effect seems to derive from habitual recre-
ational activity, indicating that strength training may be particularly
beneficial for counteracting age-related loss of neuromuscular func-
tion.

NEW & NOTEWORTHY
This cross-sectional study shows that efferent drive to contract-
ing muscle is compromised with age. Furthermore, it shows
that old subjects involved in long-term strength training miti-
gate this decline in efferent drive. In contrast, no difference in
efferent drive was observed between recreationally active and
sedentary old subjects. This indicates that strength training in
particular may be beneficial for counteracting the age-related
loss of efferent drive.
THE AGE-RELATED LOSS OF MUSCLE strength is associated with
remodeling of the nervous system (2, 26). Contributing to the
deleterious effects with age is a gradual loss of motoneurons
(2), resulting in lowered spinal and cortical motoneuron excit-
ability (15, 38, 39), reduced motoneuron firing frequency (17),
increased presynaptic inhibition (30), and slower nerve con-
duction velocity (28, 39). In combination, these impairments
seem to compromise the efferent drive to the muscle (13, 16,
42), and consequently also the force production of contracting
skeletal muscle. Ultimately, the reduction in efferent drive may
culminate in a lowered voluntary activation (VA) (10, 31),
albeit VA reductions are not always observed with advancing
age (34).
Applying evoked reflex recordings in the calf muscles, we
recently documented that the efferent drive in old individuals
was improved after 8 wk of strength training, evident as a
�70% increase of the normalized V wave response [maximal
V wave amplitude/maximal M wave during maximal voluntary
contraction (MVC) (Vsup/Msup) ratio] during superimposed
MVC, and accompanied by an unaltered resting H reflex
response (42). While the H reflex primarily reflects the excit-
ability and inhibition of the peripheral Ia-afferent reflex arc, the
V wave is more sensitive to the magnitude of efferent volun-
tary drive, because motoneuron recruitment and firing fre-
quency will directly influence the size of the reflex that can be
recorded in the muscle during superimposed MVC (1, 46).
Indeed, improvements in motoneuron recruitment and firing
frequency have previously been reported following strength
training in the old. Although the completeness of motoneuron
recruitment cannot be measured directly (19), improvements
reflecting enhanced motoneuron recruitment and/or motoneu-
ron firing frequency have been indicated by measurements of
VA estimated by interpolated twitch analysis (39, 41). Also,
utilizing needle electromyography (EMG) recordings, im-
provements in motoneuron firing frequency have been docu-
mented after strength training (6, 12). Together these findings
suggest that efferent drive, specifically motoneuron firing fre-
quency, and likely also motoneuron recruitment, can be im-
proved by strength training in the old.
Interestingly, despite the observed efferent drive im-
provements in the Unhjem et al. (42) study, the Vsup/Msup
ratio of the old was still �60% lower than what was
observed in the young. Even the strongest old individuals,
with similar muscle strength as the young, exhibited sub-

 stantial efferent drive deficits. While the Vsup/Msup ratio
appears to improve following strength training in the old,
the normalized H reflex response measured at rest has been
demonstrated not to change (39, 42). The age-related depres-
sion of the resting H reflex (15, 39), in combination with the
lack of change following strength training (39, 42), may
suggest that spinal neural factors compromise efferent drive in
the old and that these deficiencies cannot be recovered by
short-term strength training. Alternatively, the lack of strength
training-induced changes on the Ia-afferent reflex arc may also
be explained by methodological limitations. Specifically, mus-
cle contractions of a certain intensity may be necessary to
detect differences. Indeed, in studies with young subjects,
strength training is shown to increase H reflex excitability
when the reflex is obtained during muscle contractions (1, 8)
but not when it is measured at rest (1, 8, 46).
To our best knowledge, all previous strength-training studies
investigating evoked potentials have been of relatively short
duration (months), typically involving subjects with little or no
strength-training experience. Not only is a short-term training
intervention insufficient to reach the strength levels attained by
long-term continuous strength training, but also it may be
questioned whether a lack of strength training over many
decades may have led to irrefutable neuronal loss, which might
not be restored if it is first lost. Therefore the aim of the current
study was to assess evoked reflex potentials in exceptionally
strength-trained master athletes, a testament to long-term high-
intensity strength training, and compare these to recreationally
active and sedentary old individuals. Specifically, we hypoth-
esized that efferent drive and Ia-afferent reflex arc excitability
would be higher in master athletes compared with recreation-
ally active and sedentary old, but not different from young.
METHODS
Subjects
A total of 41, 32 old (�65 yr) and 9 young (18–30 yr), healthy,
nonsmoking, nonobese [body mass index (BMI) � 30] male subjects
participated in the study. Strength-trained master athletes [MA; n �
11; age 71 � 4 (SD) yr; weight 92.5 � 12.9 kg; height 178 � 9 cm]
were recruited through strength and weight-lifting clubs. All MA
participants reported to have started their strength training before 20
yr of age and that they subsequently had been engaged in continuous
lifelong strength training. At the current time they all competed in
power and/or weight lifting at the national and/or international level,
and the group included two recent world champions, as well as six
recent national champions. Strength-training characteristics of the MA
are presented in Table 1. Other old subjects were recruited through
senior societies and assigned to two groups, sedentary old (SO; n �
10; age 71 � 4 yr; weight 97.4 � 12.9 kg; height 179 � 6 cm) or
recreationally active old (AO; n � 11; age 73 � 6 yr; weight 87.0 �
17.6 kg; height 178 � 8 cm), on the basis of their activity level.
Subjects that reported participation in recreational activities (i.e.,
hiking, golf, orienteering, cross-country skiing, biking, dancing) 2–4
times a week were allocated to the AO group, while those that
reported less than one time per week were allocated to the SO group.
Importantly, all subjects in the AO and SO groups reported not
engaging in systematic strength training. Young moderately active
subjects (n � 9; age 22 � 2 yr; weight 79.3 � 12.0 kg; height 187 �
5 cm) were recruited among students at the university. The young
subjects reported participation in sports and habitual activities (i.e.,
cross-country skiing, soccer, hiking, golf) 2–4 times per week, but
none engaged in regular strength training or participated competi-
tively in sports. Exclusion criteria were any neuromuscular, pulmo-
nary, or cardiovascular disease or if the participants had any ortho-
pedic restrictions when carrying out the testing procedures. The study
was approved by the local ethics committee (Regional Committee for
Medical and Health Research Ethics in Central Norway) and con-
ducted in accordance with the latest Declaration of Helsinki. Written
informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to inclusion.
Testing of Physical Fitness
In additional to the self-reported level of recreational activities, as
an objective measurement of general fitness level, maximal oxygen
consumption (V
˙ O2max) was tested using an incremental treadmill
(Woodway, Weil am Rhein, Germany) protocol. After a 10-min
warm-up period, the speed was set to 6 km/h for the three old groups,
and then the incline was gradually increased by 2% every minute. For
the moderately active young group, to allow running, the inclination
was kept constant at 5%, and the speed increased by 1 km/h every
minute. All subjects continued their effort until exhaustion, and
encouragement was given to the participants toward the end of the
test. Oxygen consumption measurements were obtained using the
Cortex Metamax II (Cortex Biophysik, Leipzig, Germany), and stan-
dardized criteria were applied to determine V
˙ O2max in accordance with
previous literature (47).
Strength-Testing Experimental Protocol
Participants carried out all strength testing in a single day. The 3-h
experimental protocol started with MVC and evoked reflex record-
ings, continued with VA measurements after 20-min rest, and ended
after another 20 min of rest with measurements of one-repetition
maximum (1RM) and rate of force development (RFD) in a leg press
apparatus. All subjects performed all testing procedures.
Evoked Potentials
Evoked potentials were elicited in the tibial nerve in the right leg in
a custom-made, fixed plantar flexion apparatus (Fig. 1A) (42). All
reflex recordings were obtained seated with a 90° knee angle and the
ankle joint dorsiflexed at 20°. Eyes were fixed on a marked point on
the wall, to ensure similar eye and head movement during testing. A
1-ms square-wave stimulus was delivered in the popliteal fossa, using
a current stimulator (DS7AH; Digitimer, Welwyn Garden City, UK)
and bipolar felt pad electrodes (8 mm in diameter, 25 mm between
tips; Digitimer) at the position eliciting the largest H reflex potential
with the concomitant smallest M wave. Recordings of evoked poten-
tials were obtained from musculus soleus (SOL), m. gastrocnemius
medialis (GM), m. gastrocnemius lateralis (GL), and m. tibialis
anterior (TA), through self-adhesive AgCI electrodes (M-00-S/50;
Ambu, Ballerup, Denmark). By use of measuring tape and anatomical
landmarks, electrodes were placed in accordance with Surface Elec-
tromyography for the Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles (SE-
NIAM) recommendations (11), after a skin preparation procedure
including shaving, rubbing with skin prep gel (Nuprep; Weaver,
Aurora, CO), and wiping the skin with alcohol, to provide interelec-
trode impedance �5 k�. Data were obtained using a ME6000
Biomonitor (Mega Electronics, Kuopio, Finland) at 2 kHz with a

filtered (8–500 Hz), mediated through Megawin software 700,046
version 3.0.
Although recordings were obtained from all three plantar flexors
(SOL, GM, and GL), stimulation intensity was consistently adjusted
to optimize SOL reflex recordings throughout the testing. After
performing two plantar flexion MVCs, resting maximal H reflex
amplitude (Hmax) was determined by gradually increasing the current
intensity with 2-mA increments until a plateau or a decline in H reflex
amplitude was observed with further increasing current intensity.
After resting H reflex recordings were obtained, the subjects were
instructed to perform MVC, while the electrical stimulus was applied
during MVC to determine the SOL maximal superimposed H reflex
amplitude (Hsup). The current stimulator was initially set to the
intensity needed to evoke resting Hmax and was further increased with
2-mA increments until a plateau or a decline in reflex amplitude was
observed with further increasing current intensity. Each contraction
lasted �2 s, and the stimuli were given after a plateau of torque was
observed. Two-minute rest periods were given between each trial, and
Hsup was achieved within four to six trials. The highest recorded reflex
potentials during MVC in GM and GL are also referred to as Hsup.
Maximal M wave amplitude during rest (Mmax) was then determined
by increasing the current intensity by 5–10 mA, until no further
increase in M wave amplitude was observed. To ensure that a true
Mmax was obtained, two supramaximal stimuli at 150% of the inten-
sity needed to evoke Mmax were given. After a 10-min rest period, six
V waves were recorded by delivering a supramaximal stimulus during
MVC (1). EMGrms was determined from the best MVC trial, and the
recordings between �100 ms of peak force were converted to the root
mean square (rms) and normalized to the maximal peak-to-peak
amplitude M wave obtained during MVC (Msup).
VA Assessment Using Interpolated Twitch Method
Plantar flexion VA was determined by interpolated twitch, with the
ankle in a �20° dorsiflexed position. Six plantar flexion MVCs were
performed, in which a single square-wave supramaximal stimulus
(150% of the stimulus intensity needed to evoke Mmax) was delivered
to the tibial nerve when a plateau of force was reached. Three seconds
after the MVC another supramaximal stimulus was given to determine
potentiated resting twitch. Two-minute rest was given between each
trial. Force data were recorded at 2 kHz through a force platform (Fig.
1B) (model 9286AA; Kistler, Winterthur, Switzerland).
Strength Testing
Plantar flexion MVC was obtained prior to the evoked potential
recordings, in the same custom-made plantar flexion apparatus (Fig.
1A). Each subject was given two trials, and the highest torque attained
was recorded as MVC. A 2-min rest period was given between each
trial, and subjects were instructed to perform the contraction as fast
and forcefully as possible. Finally, after the evoked potentials and VA
assessments for plantar flexion, as a measurement of performance-
associated strength, maximal dynamic muscle strength in the lower
extremities was measured as 1RM using a seated horizontal leg press
apparatus (Technogym, Gambettola, Italy). Knee joint angle in the
lower position was set to 90°. After three warm-up sets of six to eight
repetitions, the load was gradually increased by 10 kg until failure.
1RM was typically achieved within three to five trials. Rest periods
between each trial were 3–5 min. RFD was recorded in the same leg
press apparatus, through a force platform (model 9286AA; Kistler) at
2 kHz. The load was set to the closest 10-kg increment above the
subject’s body weight (32), and the lift was performed from a 90°
knee joint angle. Subjects were instructed to move slowly down to a
90° knee angle, hold the position for 1 s, and then perform the
concentric phase of the movement as fast and forcefully as possible.
Each subject was given three attempts, of which only the best trial was
considered for analysis.
Leg Muscle Volume
Leg muscle volume of the right thigh and lower leg was estimated
through anthropometrical measurements, utilizing measuring tape and
skin fold caliper (Holtain, Crosswell, UK). Thigh length was mea-
sured from the lateral femoral epicondyle to the greater trochanter,
while lower leg length was measured from the lateral malleolus to the
head of fibula. Thigh circumferences were measured at the midpoint
and 10 cm proximal and distal to the midpoint, while lower leg
circumferences were measured below the fibular head, at the mid-
point, and above the lateral malleolus. Skin fold measurements were
taken at three sites at the midpoint for both thigh (medial, anterior, and
lateral) and lower leg (medial, posterior, and lateral). The method has
previously been found valid with acceptable accuracy compared with
proton magnetic resonance imaging (1H-MRI) (22).
Data Analysis
Only the V wave trials in which the torque was �90% of MVC and
the M wave was �95% Msup were used for analysis. Reflex potentials
obtained during rest (Hmax) were normalized to Mmax, while reflex
recordings obtained during MVC (Hsup, Vsup) were normalized to the
maximal M wave amplitude obtained during MVC (Msup). Latency of
the H reflex was determined as the time interval between the electrical
stimulus to the first detection of the reflex volley. Because stimulation
intensity was optimized for SOL, the percentage of Mmax/Msup elic-
ited at Hmax/Hsup was analyzed only for this muscle. VA was calcu-
lated, using Bioware software v.3.06 (Kistler), as [1 � (superimposed
twitch/resting peak twitch)] � 100, and expressed as a percentage (3).
RFD, both for dynamic leg press and isometric plantar flexion, was
calculated as �force/�time between 10 and 90% of peak force (32).
Isometric plantar flexion RFD was normalized to MVC to express
relative plantar flexion RFD. Furthermore, to account for potential
differences in body mass, leg press 1RM was expressed in absolute
values, relative to body weight (kg�1), and relative to allometrically
scaled body weight (kg�0.67). Leg muscle volume was calculated
using the following equation: V � (L/12�)·(C12 � C22 � C32) �
[(S � 0.4)/2]·L·[(C1 � C2 � C3)/3], where L refers to length, C1, C2,
and C3 refer to proximal, middle, and distal circumferences, respec-
tively, and S refers to skin fold thickness (22), and divided by length
to express leg cross-sectional area.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using the software package
SPSS 21.0 (Chicago, IL), while figures were made using GraphPad
Prism 5 (San Diego, CA). Normality of data was confirmed by
quantile-quantile plots. One-way ANOVAs were applied to detect

analysis, when appropriate. The Pearson test for linear regression was
used to assess correlation between variables. The level of statistical
significance was set to P � 0.05. All data are presented as means � SD,
unless otherwise noted.
RESULTS
All 41 subjects completed all the testing procedures, without
any circumstances advocating subject exclusion. The four
groups were not different with respect to height and weight,
and the three old groups were not different from each other
with regard to age, but all were naturally significantly different
from the age of the young (P � 0.01). V
˙ O2max measurements
confirmed the reported activity level of the old subjects, as both
AO (26%) and the MA (19%) exhibited higher V
˙ O2max com-
pared with SO (P � 0.05). Furthermore, all the old groups had
a lower V
˙ O2max compared with young (P � 0.01).
Muscle Strength
As expected, the MA exhibited superior performance in all
measured strength variables compared with AO and SO (Table
2). 1RM was 45% higher than AO, 75% higher than SO, and
even 26% higher than the moderately active young controls (P
� 0.01). Similarly, dynamic leg press RFD was 159% faster
than AO, 178% faster than SO (P � 0.01), and 53% faster than
young (P � 0.05). Also for the plantar flexion MVC, MA was
28 and 24% stronger than AO and SO, respectively (P � 0.05),
but with no difference from the young controls. Isometric
plantar flexion RFD was 93 and 87%, respectively, faster in
MA compared with SO and AO (P � 0.01). Also when
expressed relative to MVC, the MA had faster RFD than SO
(38%) and AO (37%) (P � 0.01). Thigh muscle volume was
22, 14, and 14%, respectively, higher in the MA compared with
AO, SO, and young (P � 0.05).
Evoked Potentials
MA had 53 and 60% higher (P � 0.01) SOL Vsup/Msup
ratios compared with AO and SO, respectively (Table 3). Yet
SOL Vsup/Msup ratio of all three old groups was lower (P �
0.01) compared with young (Fig. 2). No difference was ob-
served in SOL Vsup/Msup ratio between AO and SO. SOL
Vsup/Msup ratio correlated positively with MVC (r � 0.30, P �
0.05), VA (r � 0.45, P � 0.01), and RFD (r � 0.34, P � 0.05).
In contrast, SOL Hmax/Mmax ratio and SOL Hsup/Msup ratio
were not different between any of the old groups, but again all
the old groups were lower (P � 0.01) compared with young

 (Fig. 3). SOL H reflex latency was 7 and 5% shorter (P � 0.05)
in MA compared with AO and SO, respectively, with no
difference observed between AO and SO. The young group
exhibited SOL H reflex latency shorter (P � 0.05) than all
three old groups. The relative M response (% of Mmax) elicited
during resting Hmax was lower in MA compared with AO (P �
0.01) and SO (P � 0.01), but not different from the young
(Table 3). There was a negative correlation between SOL
Hmax/Mmax ratio and SOL H reflex latency (r � �0.63, P �
0.01), while the relative M response elicited at resting Hmax
correlated negatively with 1RM (r � �0.43, P � 0.01) and
RFD (r � �0.55, P � 0.01). A positive correlation was
observed between SOL Hsup and SOL Vsup (r � 0.52, P �
0.01).
Similar to what was observed in SOL, GM Vsup/Msup ratio
was higher (P � 0.05) in MA compared with both AO (75%)
and SO (110%) (Table 4). However, MA had a 51% lower
(P � 0.01) Vsup/Msup ratio compared with young. Additionally,
no difference in GM Vsup/Msup ratio was observed between AO
and SO. Furthermore, there was no difference in H/M ratio
between any of the three old groups, neither at rest nor during
MVC. However, all three old groups were lower compared
with young, both at rest (GM Hmax/Mmax, P � 0.01) and during
MVC (GM Hsup/Msup, P � 0.01). GM latency was shorter in
MA compared with AO (12%, P � 0.05) and SO (9%, P �
0.05), while young exhibited shorter latency in GM compared
with all the old groups (P � 0.05). Correlations revealed that
GM Vsup/Msup ratio was associated with MVC (r � 0.41, P �
0.01) and VA (r � 0.33, P � 0.05). Finally, similar to SOL, a
positive correlation was observed between GM Hsup and GM
Vsup (r � 0.77, P � 0.01).
Adding support to the notion that evoked potentials are not
muscle dependent, recordings in GL revealed a pattern similar
to those evoked in SOL and GM (Table 5). While GL Vsup/
Msup ratio was higher in the MA compared with AO and SO
(50%, P � 0.05), no difference was observed between the old
groups in GL H/M ratio, neither at rest (Hmax/Mmax) nor during
MVC (Hsup/Msup). GL Vsup/Msup ratio, GL Hsup/Msup ratio, and
GL Hmax/Mmax ratio were all lower (P � 0.01) in the three old
groups compared with young. GL Vsup/Msup ratio correlated
with MVC (r � 0.30, P � 0.05) and VA (r � 0.55, P � 0.05).
Similar to that in SOL and GM, there was a positive correlation
between the GL Hsup and GL Vsup (r � 0.63, P � 0.01).
Mirroring the Vsup/Msup ratios, VA exhibited a tendency to
be higher in MA (89 � 7%) compared with AO (84 � 5%, P �
0.09) and SO (83 � 10%, P � 0.06), but with no difference
compared with the young (90 � 6%) (Fig. 4). In contrast, the
young group had higher VA compared with AO (P � 0.05) and
tended to be higher than SO (P � 0.06). No differences were
observed between any of the four groups in EMGrms for either
agonist (SOL, GM, and GL) or antagonist (TA) muscles. VA
correlated with the Vsup/Msup ratios in all three plantar flexor
muscles (SOL, GM, and GL) as well as MVC (r � 0.55, P �
0.01).
DISCUSSION
Efferent drive to contracting muscle has been documented to
decline with age. However, since it is not known if this
consequence of advancing age may be blunted by continuous
long-term strength training, we assessed evoked reflex record-
ings in exceptionally strength-trained master athletes and con-
trasted them to sedentary and recreationally active age-
matched individuals, as well as a young reference group. The
main finding was that the MA had twofold higher Vsup/Msup
ratios compared with the other two old groups, indicating
higher efferent drive among the MA. Second, no difference in

Strength Training Mitigates Efferent Drive Decline in the Old • Unhjem R et al.

 Vsup/Msup ratio was observed between AO and SO, indicating
that recreational activity is not a sufficient stimulus to maintain
efferent drive. Finally, despite the elevated efferent drive of the
MA over the other old groups, their Vsup/Msup ratio was lower
compared with young. This apparent inevitable impairment
may, at least in part, rely on deterioration of the Ia-afferent
reflex arc since MA had an elevated V wave, but not H reflex
response compared with AO and SO. In combination, these
findings imply that strength training in particular is necessary
for efferent drive preservation with age.
Evoked Reflex Potentials and Age
The elevated Vsup/Msup ratios observed in strength-trained
MA in this study were present in all three plantar flexor muscle
groups, suggesting that lifelong strength training has a system-
atically protective effect on the efferent drive with advancing
age. Although the 0.28 � 0.15 ratio in this group of excep-
tionally trained old individuals is somewhat lower than the
0.3–0.5 ratio that has typically been observed in young men (1,
9, 42), it was twofold higher than what was observed in
sedentary and recreationally active counterparts in the current
study. Interestingly, the V wave response, reflecting the mag-
nitude of efferent neural drive, was similar in AO and SO. This
suggests that high-intensity strength training in particular may
be necessary to preserve efferent neural drive and that physical
activity per se is not sufficient to induce any efferent drive
maintenance. Thus, in light of this, both SO and AO may be
referred to as untrained. The results in these two untrained
groups are in agreement with Vsup/Msup ratios reported in
moderately active �70-yr-old men in a previous study (42). In
contrast to the Vsup/Msup ratio, the H/M ratio did not reveal any
difference between the MA and untrained old, either at rest or
during MVC. Thus the decline in both resting and superim-
posed H/M ratio appears to be inevitable with aging per se (15,
39). Previous short-term training interventions with old partic-
ipants have also documented that the resting Hmax/Mmax ratio
does not demonstrate plasticity (39, 42). In combination, these
findings suggest that a decrease of the H/M ratio with age (i.e.,
deterioration of the Ia-afferent reflex arc) is independent of
training status and training duration. Importantly, although the
H reflex and the V wave rely on the same Ia-afferent pathways,
the V wave recruits a broader motoneuron pool, because of
stronger electrical stimuli and greater supraspinal input during
MVC, bringing more motoneurons closer to their firing thresh-
old (27). In light of this, the characteristics of the V wave relate
more to high-threshold, faster motor units than does the H
reflex response, which is mainly constituted by slow twitch
motor unit action potentials. Thus the elevated Vsup/Msup ratio
of the MA, together with the declined H/M ratios, may suggest
that strength training has the most prominent neuroprotective
effect on the high-threshold fast twitch motor units.
Evoked Reflex Potentials Mechanisms
The supramaximal electrical stimulus applied during a MVC
evokes an antidromic volley in the efferent axons (in addition
to an afferent reflex volley and a M wave). At rest the H reflex

 is completely abolished by collisions with these antidromic
potentials, but during MVC the V wave arises because of
removal of antidromic potentials by voluntary efferent output,
leaving the motoneurons open for transmission of the reflex
volley (1, 43). On this basis, the V wave, in combination with
the H reflex, has been used to express the magnitude of efferent
drive to the muscle. Importantly, as emphasized by Aagaard et
al. (1), the V wave should be interpreted in conjunction with
the maximal H reflex volley evocable during MVC (Hsup). This
is because H reflex measurements obtained during MVC more
accurately reflect the motoneuron excitability and amount of
presynaptic/postsynaptic inhibition during a contraction (1)
and thus also the actual reflex volley traveling the reflex arc
during a V wave trial. In fact, in this scenario, the term “H
reflex” may also be somewhat inappropriate, i.e., because a
stronger electrical stimulus is needed to evoke the maximal
reflex volley during MVC, which may suggest the activation of
higher threshold motoneurons (as with the V wave), while the
resting H reflex involves mainly the activation of lower thresh-
old motoneurons.
V wave interpretation. Since the H reflex response did not
differ between any of the old groups, this implies that the
elevated Vsup/Msup ratio of the MA may not be explained by
the size of the reflex volley (i.e., differences in motoneuron
excitability and/or presynaptic/postsynaptic inhibition). In pre-
vious literature (1, 7, 46), alterations in Vsup/Msup ratio have
been partly ascribed to changes in supraspinal activation of the
motoneuron pool. Although this explanation is certainly also
germane for the disparate Vsup/Msup ratios in the current study,
caution should be observed in elucidating the origin of such a
change in efferent drive, since different recruitment of affer-
ents and motoneurons, as well as spinal reflex pathways, may
influence the efferent drive during MVC (4, 24). In general, the
V wave response as a measure of the magnitude of efferent
neural drive to myofibers is sensitive to changes in motoneuron
firing frequency and motoneuron recruitment (1). Previous
studies have indeed shown that strength training is accompa-
nied by marked increases in maximal motoneuron firing fre-
quency, both in old and young subjects (6, 12). Accordingly,
strength-trained MA are shown to possess �20% higher max-
imal firing rates, compared with untrained old (23). Such a
difference may indeed account for some of the observed
differences in efferent drive in our study. However, based on
the original equation put forward by Upton et al. (43), a �20%
maximal firing frequency difference cannot alone explain the
twofold larger Vsup/Msup ratio in the current study. This sug-
gests that in addition to elevated firing frequency, motoneuron
recruitment is likely also more complete in strength-trained
master athletes (1).
H reflex interpretation. The interpretation of the similar H/M
ratio in the three old groups in this study is challenging
because, regardless of age, participants in explosive sports
have previously been documented to exhibit lower H/M ratios
compared with untrained individuals (5). This is because ex-
plosive athletes typically have a high proportion of fast twitch
type II muscle fibers, whereas the H reflex primarily manifests
itself in the slower twitch type I fibers (5). Since the strength-
trained MA in the current study should be considered “explo-
sive athletes,” the H/M ratios similar to the untrained old may
actually represent some maintenance of the reflex arc, since a
lower reflex response among athletes would be expected in
general. In support of this notion, the H reflex latency was
found to be shorter in the MA compared with the two untrained
old groups. Indeed, this finding suggests superior maintenance
of the Ia-afferent reflex arc of the old MA. The shorter reflex
latency in the MA may be due to denser myelination and
shorter internodal length in both afferent and efferent fibers (2,
28, 39, 42) but may also reflect a lower dropout of the largest
axonal fibers, which possess the highest conduction velocity
(2). Interestingly, our results revealed that MA had relative M
waves accompanying the resting Hmax similar to the young.
This indicates that the most excitable largest Ia-afferent fibers
may be preserved. In contrast, the untrained old had larger
relative M waves associated with their resting Hmax. In turn,
this suggests a closer excitability threshold between afferent
and efferent fibers, possibly due to a loss of the largest
Ia-afferent fibers (40). Notably, no difference in the relative M
waves accompanying Hsup was observed during MVC.
V wave and H reflex relationship. A direct comparison of the
Vsup/Msup ratio between subjects with very different H reflex
responses may be difficult, i.e., because the size of the evoked
H reflex response will directly influence the size of the con-
comitant V wave. Indeed, a relationship between Hsup and Vsup
was indicated by strong correlations between the two variables
for all three plantar flexors in this study. For example, an old
subject with a small reflex response will need more efferent
drive to achieve the same Vsup/Msup ratio compared with a
young subject with a larger reflex response. While comparison
of the Vsup/Msup ratio between the three old groups in the
current study is fairly straightforward because their H reflex
responses were similar, comparison to the young is challenging
since their Hsup/Msup ratios were larger. To account for this
difference, the maximal V wave amplitude and the maximal H
reflex amplitude obtained during MVC may be seen in relation
to each other when comparing the efferent drive in subjects
with H reflex differences. In fact, in the current study it implies
that the master athletes’ efferent drive may actually be closer to
the young than what is first observed when the Vsup/Msup ratio
is considered alone. Discrepancies in the relationship between
Vsup and Hsup may however also imply that different M-H

 recruitment curves exist at MVC between the groups. Because
aging is characterized by a loss of the largest axonal fibers (2),
it may become more difficult to selectively activate Ia-afferents
without also recruiting motor axons; hence antidromic colli-
sions may occur already at lower stimulus intensity in the old,
decreasing the maximal amplitude of the H reflex. Importantly,
although this feature hampers the comparison of Vsup and Hsup
across different age groups, it may advocate better preservation
of the largest axonal fibers in the MA compared with the
untrained old.
Voluntary Activation
As assessed by interpolated twitch (3), VA was similar
between MA and young. MA also exhibited a clear tendency to
have a higher VA than the untrained old groups. Although
interpolated twitch techniques have been widely used to assess
VA differences between young and old, the findings with
regard to this measure remain equivocal. Some studies have
reported a very high or complete VA in the old (34, 45), while
others have documented an incomplete activation (10, 31, 48).
Our results endorse the latter, advocating that a reduced effer-
ent drive in untrained old is manifested in a reduced ability to
fully activate skeletal muscle. While changes in the Vsup/Msup
ratio often have been ascribed to changes in motoneuron firing
frequency (1), interpolated twitch measurements performed
with a single stimulus (i.e., for measurements of VA) may be
more sensitive to differences in motoneuron recruitment. This
is because a single supramaximal nerve stimulation is likely to
recruit all available motoneurons simultaneously, yet a single
stimulus has very limited potential to detect changes in dis-
charge frequency (29). Recognizing the corresponding differ-
ences in both interpolated twitch and Vsup/Msup ratio, it ap-
peared that the old MA exhibited greater capacity for both
motoneuron recruitment and firing frequency compared with
the untrained old. Indeed, this difference in efferent drive may
be the main contributing factor to the differences in force
production between the groups.
Reduced Efferent Drive and Skeletal Muscle Strength
While previous studies with strength-trained master athletes
have demonstrated that they possess maximal muscle strength
similar to what is typically seen in 20-yr-old individuals (20,
33), the findings in the current study strengthen this assertion,
presenting evidence that 70-yr-old athletes can be considerably
stronger than young. Our careful selection of highly trained
master athletes certainly is an example of exceptionally suc-
cessful aging and likely represents close to a muscle strength
ceiling relative to their age. Not only was the MA maximal
strength superior compared with what was observed in the
young, but also the functionally important dynamic leg press
RFD was �50% faster than the young controls, and more than
150% faster than the two untrained old groups. Similarly, the
isometric plantar flexion RFD, both expressed in absolute
values and relative to MVC, was higher (�90 and �40%,
respectively) compared with the untrained old. The RFD is
documented to largely rely on neuromuscular factors, reflect
maximal motoneuron firing frequency, and decrease with age
(6, 12, 13). Also, strength training-induced gains in RFD seem
to closely relate to increases in maximal motoneuron firing
frequency (6, 12), particularly during the initial phase (�75
ms) of contraction (16, 25, 44). As a consequence, the RFD
characteristics of the MA in the current study likely reflect a
high efferent neural drive during rapid muscle contractions.
Importantly, none of the investigated characteristics of the
neuromuscular system in our study displayed any differences
between sedentary and recreationally active old participants.
This is somewhat surprising but may suggest that high-inten-
sity strength training in particular, and not physical activity per
se, may be essential to preserve the neuromuscular function
with age. Although assessed by indirect estimates and animal
studies, it has been proposed that lifelong physical training
may selectively mitigate the loss of motoneurons, as motoneu-
ron preservation seems to manifest itself primarily in the motor
units directly associated with the physical strain (14, 37).
Albeit investigated in endurance athletes, the estimated number
of motor units in the tibialis anterior muscle was higher in
lifelong runners compared with age-matched sedentary indi-
viduals (35, 36). In contrast, the estimated number of motor
units in the biceps brachii muscle, which is not directly in-
volved in running, was not different between the two groups.
Since the age-related loss of motoneurons is suggested to
primarily affect the fast twitch motor units (2, 18, 21), it may
be that high-intensity strength training, targeting the fast twitch
motor units, could be particularly beneficial for counteracting
the age-related loss of neuromuscular function. Indeed, the
elevated V wave response of the MA, along with the declined
H reflex response, is in accordance with this assumption.
Conclusion
Although some deterioration of the Hoffman reflex circuit
seem inevitable, the current study demonstrated that exception-
ally strength-trained master athletes showed mitigated age-
related attenuation in the magnitude of efferent neural drive to
maximally contracting skeletal muscle. In contrast, recreation-
ally active old individuals did not exhibit any of this advantage
for healthy aging, suggesting that strength training in particular
may be necessary for efferent drive maintenance.
