Context: Human cross-sectional and animal studies have shown an association of the chemical
bisphenol A (BPA) with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic diseases, but no human
experimental study has investigated whether BPA alters insulin/C-peptide secretion.
Design: Men and postmenopausal women (without diabetes) were orally administered either the
vehicle or a BPA dose of 50 mg/kg body weight, which has been predicted by US regulators (Food and
Drug Administration, Environmental Protection Agency) to be the maximum, safe daily oral BPA dose
over the lifetime. Insulin response was assessed in two cross-over experiments using an oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT; experiment 1) and a hyperglycemic (HG) clamp (experiment 2). Main outcomes
were the percentage change of BPA session measures relative to those of the control session.
Results: Serum bioactive BPA after experimental exposure was at levels detected in human bio-
monitoring studies. In the OGTT, a strong positive correlation was found between hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c) and the percentage change in the insulinogenic index (Spearman = 0.92), an indicator of early-
phase insulin response, and the equivalent C-peptide index (Pearson = 0.97). In the HG clamp study,
focusing on the later-phase insulin response to a stable level of glucose, several measures of insulin and
C-peptide appeared suppressed during the BPA session relative to the control session; the change in
insulin maximum concentration (Cmax) was negatively correlated with HbA1c and the Cmax of bio-
active serum BPA.
Conclusions: This exploratory study suggests that BPA exposure to a dose considered safe by US
regulators may alter glucose-stimulated insulin response in humans.

Disruption of glucose homeostasis is a common feature of metabolic diseases that has become
more prevalent in recent decades [1, 2]. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is modulated by
hormones and can be altered by environmental endocrine-disrupting contaminants such as
bisphenol A (BPA), which is the monomer commonly used to manufacture thermal paper

 receipts, polycarbonate plastic, and a wide range of other products; BPA is one of the highest
volume chemicals in global production (.7 billion metric tons per year).
Experiments with human and mouse pancreatic b cells have revealed the molecular
mechanisms by which a low-dose exposure of estradiol or BPA, in the presence of 8 mM
(144 mg/dL) glucose, triggers a rapid release of insulin within minutes [3–6]. In contrast to
these rapid effects, an experiment with adult male mice showed that low-dose BPA exposure
for 4 days caused insulin resistance, as indicated by intraperitoneal glucose and insulin
tolerance tests [3, 7].
Because of these findings and the ubiquitous nature of BPA exposures in the general US
population [8], a hypothesis has been proposed that in susceptible individuals, exposure to BPA
could interact with genetic and lifestyle factors to promote the development of metabolic diseases
[2]. This hypothesis is supported by data from cross-sectional and prospective epidemiological
studies showing a relationship between BPA levels and metabolic diseases: obesity, insulin
resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and both cardiovascular and nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease [9–15], as well as a large literature showing that BPA causes similar effects in animals
[1, 2, 16]. Although there has been controversy concerning whether human exposure to BPA is
high enough to warrant concern, the exposure models used have been based on the assumption
that BPA exposure is almost entirely from food sources, such that BPA would be subjected to
extensive first-pass metabolism. However, we have shown that transdermal absorption from BPA-
coated thermal paper, when enhanced by the use of hand sanitizer, can result in serum levels of
bioactive (unconjugated) BPA within the range of levels reported in human biomonitoring studies
[17, 18], and that these levels are similar to the ones showing effects in vitro and in animal studies.
Resolving controversies about the safety for the general population of exposure to manmade
chemicals is often hampered, appropriately, by ethical challenges to conducting human ex-
periments with chemicals that are potentially harmful. However, we identified an ethical path
to a controlled human experimental exposure using BPA. First, the BPA effect we were looking
for is rapid and transient and should require only a single BPA exposure. BPA itself is not
persistent and is cleared with a half-life of about 6 hours after oral administration [19]. There is
evidence of repeated daily exposures to BPA [20], to which our study would only add one ad-
ditional exposure. We thus exposed subjects to the oral BPA exposure believed by US regulators
to be safe over a lifetime, known as the “reference dose,” which is 50 mg BPA/kg body weight per
day [21]. Finally, before we began the formal study, we conducted a pilot study on two of the
authors (R.W.S. and F.S.v.S.) and found that the BPA reference dose produced internal bioactive
levels that were not different from what we found in our thermal receipt paper study [18].
We conducted this experiment to test two competing hypotheses: US regulatory agencies
hypothesize that there should be no measurable adverse effect on health-relevant outcomes
in people in response to daily exposure to BPA at the reference dose. We hypothesized on the
basis of a large literature from animal experiments and human epidemiology that there
would be demonstrable effects in response to a single exposure to this dose of BPA.
We therefore conducted two exploratory cross-over studies, with each subject serving as
his/her own control, by testing subjects with and without BPA exposure. We recruited adults
without diabetes to investigate effects of oral BPA exposure on the insulin response to
glucose. In experiment 1, we examined the effect of BPA on insulin response with an oral
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to examine both the initial and later phases of the insulin
response to glucose. In experiment 2, we used the hyperglycemic (HG) clamp because it
enabled us to stabilize glucose prior to BPA administration. The focus of the clamp exper-
iment was thus only on the later phase of the insulin response to glucose.
1. General Methods
In this exploratory study, we assessed the insulin response to a glucose challenge using the
OGTT in experiment 1 and the HG clamp in experiment 2 (Fig. 1). Two investigators (R.W.S.,
F.S.v.S.) piloted the OGTT protocol. Both experiments used a cross-over design, with par-
ticipating subjects attending two separate sessions, BPA and control, such that each subject

 was his/her own control. As a result, the main outcome variables were not the session-specific
results but instead were the percentage difference between the subject’s BPA and control visit
results [100% 3 (XBPA – Xcontrol)/Xcontrol]. This environmental exposure study was not reg-
istered at Clinicaltrials.gov because it does not meet the definition of an “applicable drug
clinical trial” according to federal regulations. As part of this assessment, we requested and
received an exemption from the relevant Investigational New Drug requirements of the US
Food and Drug Administration. The University of Missouri Health Sciences Institutional
Review Board approved the protocols. There were no adverse events.
A. Subject Visits
Subjects were scheduled for two visits to the University of Missouri Clinical Research Center
(CRC), allowing at least 1 week of washout time between visits. The subjects were randomly
assigned by author J.A.T., via a software-generated sequence, to receive BPA at either the first or
second visit. Other investigators, the subject, and nurses were blinded as to treatment order. For
48 hours prior to a visit, subjects were asked to avoid canned food and beverage and to minimize
handling of cash register receipts to reduce background BPA levels. The subjects were instructed
to fast overnight before the study visit, and to report to the CRC in the morning (typically 8 AM).
B. BPA/Control Solutions and Administration
BPA (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; .99% pure) was dissolved in Everclear
(95% food-grade ethanol Luxco, St. Louis, MO) to form a BPA stock solution (10 mg BPA/mL).
Tonic water was mixed with Everclear (Luxco, St. Louis, MO) to create a tonic water and 15%
ethanol stock solution. Tonic water helped maintain blinding by masking the slightly bitter
Figure 1. Experimental design summary. We performed two experiments; 8 subjects in each
experiment (16 total). To assess insulin response, we used the OGTT in the first experiment
and the HG clamp in the second experiment. For the OGTT, the oral glucose dose was 100 g.
In the clamp study, glucose was measured every 5 minutes, and the rate of the 20% glucose
IV was changed according to a spreadsheet-based algorithm to achieve a stable (“clamped”)
glucose level of 144 mg/dL (8 mM) by a time of ~30 minutes. This glucose level was chosen
based upon published in vitro studies that showed a rapid release of insulin was triggered in
human and mouse b cells by estradiol or BPA at a glucose concentration of 8 mM. Main
blood draw times (insulin, C-peptide, BPA) are indicated by “X”; the events marked with
arrows (e.g., BPA or control dosing, oral glucose administration) occurred just after the blood
draw at the specified time.

 taste of BPA. All solutions were stored at 4°C. The concentration of the BPA in the BPA stock
solution was measured by Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
prior to use as previously described [18]. For control sessions, subjects were given 1 mL of the
tonic water/15% ethanol solution. For the BPA visits, the body weight measured at the CRC
for that visit was used to calculate the BPA dose. The volume of the BPA stock solution
required to give that dose was added to the tonic water/ethanol stock solution to give a final
volume of 1 mL. When administered, the subjects were directed to hold the BPA or control
solution under their tongues for 60 seconds before swallowing to increase sublingual ab-
sorption of BPA. Based on the subjects’ BPA visit weights, the total BPA administered ranged
from 3.3 to 5.4 mg and ethanol volume from 0.41 to 0.58 mL to achieve a final dose of 50 mg/kg
body weight in a 1-mL ethanol-tonic water solution.
C. Insulin and C-Peptide (b Cell) Response Assessment
In both experiments we measured glucose (plasma), insulin (serum), and C-peptide (serum)
at multiple time points. These data were corrected for within-subject differences between
control and BPA sessions so that the starting point of each outcome measure was equal to the
average of the starting point data from subjects’ control and BPA sessions, with other session
values adjusted accordingly. The starting point for the OGTT experiment was glucose time
zero (10 minutes after BPA administration), and for the HG clamp experiment, at the time of
BPA/control administration (clamp time, 30 minutes) when blood glucose was stabilized. For
BPA and the metabolic measurements, we identified the maximum concentration (Cmax) of
each analyte and calculated the area under the concentration time curve (AUC) using the
trapezoidal rule.
D. Metabolic Measurements
Serum was analyzed at the University of Missouri Diabetes Diagnostic Laboratory for he-
moglobin A1c (HbA1c) (using the Tosoh G8 variant mode ion-exchange HPLC method; Tosoh
Biosciences, San Francisco, CA). Insulin and C-peptide were measured using the Tosoh AIA-
PACK IRI and ST AIA-PACK C-peptide II reagents on the Tosoh AIA-900 (Tosoh Biosciences,
San Francisco, CA). In the OGTT experiment, glucose was measured in fluoride plasma using
the Roche GLUC3 hexokinase reagents on a Roche Cobas 311 (Roche Diagnostics, Indian-
apolis, IN). In the HG clamp experiment, plasma glucose was measured every 5 minutes at
the bedside in the CRC using the YSI 2300 Stat Plus (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH).

Unconjugated BPA (uBPA) and its primary metabolites, bisphenol glucuronide (BPA-G) and
bisphenol monosulfate, were measured in the vom Saal laboratory by author J.A.T. as

A and B plot the insulinogenic index, an indicator of first-phase insulin release, which is
calculated as D insulin from 0 to 30 minutes)/(D glucose from 0 to 30 minutes) (DI0-30/DG0-30).
Panels C and D plot the equivalent index using C-peptide (DCP0-30/DG0-30). Panels A and C
show two versions of the insulinogenic index, DI0-30/DG0-30 and DCP0-30/DG0-30, by session

and control sessions, plotted against HbA1c, where the percentage change in the insulinogenic
index or the C-peptide equivalent was calculated as the percentage change in outcome (%D X)
between BPA and control sessions = 100% 3 (XBPA – Xcontrol)/Xcontrol. HbA1c was measured
from the baseline blood draw of each subject’s first visit. A linear regression line is included
in the scatterplots with shaded 95% CI. The correlations of these variables with HbA1c are

HbA1c (M1 to M8 = low to high). Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to select Pearson or

 previously described [18]. The on-column limit of detection for uBPA, BPA-G, and bisphenol
monosulfate was 0.12, 0.08, and 0.15 ng/mL, respectively.
F. Statistical Analyses
For data analysis we used the R statistical system, version 3.4.0 [22], and the RStudio pro-
gramming environment, version 1.0.143 [23]. All plots were made using the R graphics package
ggplot2 [24]. Our main results were descriptive statistics, plots, correlations, and within-
subject comparisons between BPA and control session results. We added linear regression lines
to some plots. To choose between parametric (Pearson correlations, t tests) and nonparametric
methods (Spearman correlations and Wilcoxon rank tests), we tested the distribution of each
variable with the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Due to our small sample size, we conservatively
required a normality test P value .0.3 to treat data as normally distributed. We bootstrapped
95% confidence intervals for significant correlations by sampling with replacement 10,000
times. Because this is an exploratory study, we conducted many statistical tests to maximize
the information extracted from these first human experimental data. As discussed by Rothman
[25], correction for multiple comparisons in this scenario increases the chance of false nega-
tives, which in an exploratory study should be reduced.
2. Experiment 1: OGTT
A. Methods
In 2014 we consented eight male subjects with body mass index (BMI) ,30, who reported
being a nonsmoker, without prescription medications, diabetes, or prediabetes. Each subject
was weighed, had vital signs collected, and was placed in a hospital bed, with a saline lock (IV
access port) placed for blood draws. Ten minutes before the glucose drink was administered, a
blood sample was collected for fasting glucose, insulin, and C-peptide. At the first visit, this
sample was also measured for HbA1c. The BPA or control solution was then given as de-
scribed above. Ten minutes after the BPA/control administration, a second baseline was
collected (glucose time = 0 minutes), after which the subject consumed a glucose tolerance test
drink (100 g dextrose) over 1 to 3 minutes. Blood was subsequently collected at 10, 20, 40, 60,
80, 100, and 120 minutes after glucose administration.

 A-1. Calculations
In addition to the AUC and Cmax for insulin and C-peptide, the insulinogenic index, an
indicator of early-phase insulin release [26], was calculated as the change in insulin divided
by the change in glucose from time 0 to 30 minutes (DI0-30/DG0-30). The equivalent index was
also calculated for C-peptide (DCP0-30/DG0-30). Values at 30 minutes were estimated as the
mean of the 20- and 40-minute values. The Matsuda insulin sensitivity index (ISIOGTT) was
calculated as 10,000/square root (fasting insulin 3 fasting glucose 3 glucose mean(time 0-120) 3
insulin mean(time 0-120)) [27].The disposition index was insulinogenic index 3 ISIOGTT. Units
for glucose, insulin, and C-peptide were mg/dL, mU/mL, and pmol/mL, respectively).
B. Results
Our subjects are described in Table 1. Glucose, insulin, and C-peptide vs time are plotted in
Supplemental Figure 1 and BPA serum levels in Supplemental Figure 2. At baseline at the
BPA exposure session, three subjects had detectable levels of uBPA (0.7 to 1.1 ng/mL), which
indicates that these subjects had some BPA exposure prior to arrival at the CRC.
HbA1c was a strong predictor of the BPA-associated change in insulin response in the first
30 minutes after oral glucose challenge (Fig. 2; Table 2). Specifically, there was a strong cor-
relation between HbA1c and the within-subject percentage change between control and BPA
sessions in the insulinogenic index: Spearman = 0.92 (95% CI: 0.48, 1.0), P = 0.0014. The
equivalent C-peptide–based index was similar: Pearson = 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.0), P = 0.0001.
Excluding the subjects M3, M4, and M8 who had detectable uBPA at baseline, as well as subject
M5 who did not have sufficient serum for the baseline analysis, did not substantially change the
relationship of HbA1c and the insulinogenic index (Spearman = 0.80) or the C-peptide equivalent
(Pearson = 0.94). HbA1c was moderately, but not statistically significantly, associated with the
percentage change between BPA and control in the insulin sensitivity index (Spearman = –0.63,
P = 0.10) and the disposition index (Pearson = 0.64, P = 0.09).

 Beyond the initial 30 minutes after glucose administration, the results for the later phase
of insulin and C-peptide release relative to glucose levels (AUC for insulin or C-peptide,
divided by glucose AUC) were highly variable and not significantly correlated with HbA1c
or pooled serum uBPA levels (data not shown). Ignoring HbA1c, there were no significant
within-subject differences between either the treatment conditions (BPA, control) or the
pooled serum uBPA values and the percentage change in any of the outcome measures.
Measurement of pooled serum samples for uBPA in this experiment (Table 2) prevented us
from examining associations with uBPA Cmax.

 glucose in the OGTT study. Figure 1 shows the experimental design: subjects could be older,
female (postmenopausal), with obesity and prediabetes by HbA1c. Our first subject (M1) was
author R.W.S. Females were required to be postmenopausal to eliminate estrogen cycling and
any fetal risk of exposure to BPA during pregnancy. Subjects reported no history of cancers that
could be estrogen responsive. Ten subjects were originally consented (2016 to 2017); however, two
females were unable to complete both sessions due to IV access problems.
An IV was placed in one arm and a saline lock in the other arm. The IV was used to
administer 20% glucose, and the saline lock to draw blood. The saline lock was typically
placed in a dorsal hand vein of the blood draw arm; however, the antecubital fossa was used
in a few cases. The hand of the blood draw arm was then placed in a warming box maintained
at 50°C to help arterialize the venous blood.
The glucose infusion rate was calculated using a computerized algorithm provided to us by
Thomas Solomon, PhD [28], which was based on the original description of the glucose clamp
protocol [29]. The infusion rate for the first 15 minutes was set by the algorithm based on
baseline data. Thereafter, the algorithm used plasma glucose measurements, made every
5 minutes using the YSI glucose analyzer, to adjust the 20% glucose infusion rate to stabilize
(clamp) plasma glucose at 8 mM (144 mg/dL) by clamp time ~30 minutes, and then to maintain
this level for the next 90 minutes (total time, 120 minutes). Blood draws for BPA and metabolic
measurements other than glucose were taken at clamp times 0, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 90, and
120 minutes. The first blood draw (clamp time, 0) was taken just before the glucose infusion began
and was used to determine HbA1c and the fasting values for glucose, insulin, and C-peptide. The
30-minute blood draw was taken just before BPA or vehicle control administration.
A-1. Calculations
We calculated the AUC for insulin, C-peptide, and uBPA. We split these AUCs at clamp times
30 to 70 and 70 to 120 minutes because, as shown in Figure 3A, BPA peaked on average at
clamp time 70 minutes (40 minutes after BPA administration). A “late insulin response” was
calculated as the mean insulin from 90 to 120 minutes minus fasting insulin, and insulin
sensitivity was computed as 100 times the mean glucose infusion rate (mg/kg/min) from clamp
time 90 to 120 minutes divided by the mean insulin level (mU/mL) from 90 to 120 minutes [30].
B. Results
Eight subjects completed the experiment (three females, five males); their age, BMI, and

Subject IDs (males M1 to M5 and females F1 to F3) are in order of HbA1c from low to high. BMI, fasting glucose, and
fasting insulin are the average of each subject’s BPA and control visit values. HbA1c was measured during screening
prior to the main study visits. Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) is an insulin re-
sistance estimate, calculated as [fasting glucose (mM) 3 fasting insulin (mU)]/22.5.

 overlap. Based upon subject weights for their BPA sessions, the total BPA administered ranged
from 3.5 to 5.4 mg (mean, 4.6 mg). The Cmax for serum uBPA ranged from 2.3 to 15.1 ng/mL
(mean, 7.3 ng/mL), with the uBPA peak [time of Cmax (Tmax)] occurring between 20 and
60 minutes post-BPA administration (mean, 41 minutes; Fig. 3). Five of 8 subjects showed a
temporary decrease in uBPA concentration at 30 minutes postadministration, suggestive of
enterohepatic recirculation. The correlation between the serum uBPA Cmax and AUC30-120
measures was high (Pearson = 0.96; P , 0.001). Plots by subject of uBPA, insulin, and C-peptide
vs time are shown in Supplemental Figure 3. Summary plots of mean serum insulin, plasma
glucose, and glucose infusion rates are shown in Supplemental Figure 4.
For within-subject comparison of BPA vs control sessions, several C-peptide and insulin
measures were at or near significance (Table 4). The late-phase insulin measure for the BPA
session averaged 17.4% less than the control session (95% CI: –30% to –4.8%; t test, P = 0.042;
Fig. 4A). The C-peptide Cmax during the BPA session averaged 6.4% less than that of the
control session (95% CI: –11% to –1.3%; t test, P = 0.046; Fig. 4B). The insulin sensitivity
measure was not statistically different between BPA and control sessions (P = 0.24).
The HG clamp results did not show a significant association between HbA1c and the
percentage change in insulin response between BPA and control sessions (specifically, insulin
or C-peptide AUC from clamp time 30 to 120 minutes). Of these measures, the strongest
associations were between the percentage change in C-peptide AUC70-120 (t test, P 5 0.06;
Fig. 4C) and between HbA1c with the percentage change in C-peptide AUC70-120 (Spearman =
–0.66, P = 0.076; Fig. 4D).
There was some evidence for a negative association between serum uBPA and insulin
response. Serum uBPA Cmax was significantly negatively associated with percentage change
in insulin Cmax (Supplemental Fig. 5; Pearson = –0.74; P = 0.037). However, the correlation
of uBPA Cmax with C-peptide Cmax was not significant (Pearson = –0.46, P = 0.25).
The serum uBPA AUC from 30 to 120 minutes was positively correlated with age
(Spearman = 0.71, P = 0.047; Supplemental Fig. 6), although the fact that six of eight subjects
tightly cluster around age 60 years weakens this evidence.
C. Discussion
In our OGTT experiment, we found a strong positive relationship in healthy adult young men
between serum HbA1c and the within-subject percentage change between BPA and control

 sessions in the insulinogenic index and the C-peptide equivalent (Fig. 2; Table 2). Given that
the insulinogenic index is an important indicator of early-phase insulin release [26], and
HbA1c is an indicator of glycemic control and a predictor of type 2 diabetes [31], this strong
association was striking, especially considering the narrow range of HbA1c (4.9% to 5.5%)
over which it was seen. A possible hypothesis is that even a mild impairment in glucose
control (as indicated by increasing HbA1c) increases the likelihood of a stronger BPA effect on
insulin/C-peptide release, or, alternatively, that people with elevated A1c are elevated be-
cause they are more sensitive to existing estrogenic exposures.
In the HG clamp experiment in which glucose was stabilized prior to BPA or vehicle
administration, our subjects showed a different response to BPA: we observed a sig-
nificant percentage decrease between control and BPA sessions in late-phase insulin and
the C-peptide Cmax (Table 4), as well as a weak inverse relationship between the
percentage change in later-phase C-peptide AUC with HbA1c (Fig. 4D). These results,
which are opposite to the early-phase OGTT insulin findings, could indicate that BPA
has different effects on the mechanisms of the early response (release of stored insulin)
vs later insulin response (de novo insulin synthesis). This finding could also be influ-
enced by our wider subject inclusion criteria in the HG clamp experiment (e.g., inclusion
of obese, older subjects with prediabetes, including postmenopausal females). Hyper-
insulinemia, which could be aggravated by acute BPA exposure, decreases second-phase
insulin release in humans [32]. Increased levels of palmitate in obese children and ado-
lescents are also associated with initial hyperinsulinemia and then a later decrease in b-cell
function [33].
Although our study results do not demonstrate that these effects of BPA are related to
metabolic disease, they could have clinical and regulatory implications. Clinically, they

BPA administration that the Cmax occurred. C-peptide and insulin columns are the percentage difference between
BPA and control sessions [%D X = 100% 3 (XBPA – Xcontrol)/Xcontrol]. uBPA AUCs were split at 70 minutes (30 to 70 and

 support the relevance to human health of the large experimental literature (animal and in
vitro) demonstrating numerous BPA effects on metabolic outcomes [2]. From a regulatory
perspective, identifying any physiological response in humans to BPA at the presumed
“safe” daily BPA dose would indicate that key assumptions in the regulatory process are
incorrect, as discussed in prior reviews [34–36]. Guideline toxicology studies conducted by
regulatory agencies use relatively crude measures such as organ weights, histology, and tumor
incidence (often in relatively short-term studies) to determine the doses at which overtly toxic

 effects are seen, and from there, the human “safe” dose is extrapolated, but typically not tested
directly. Within that scientific framework, the results we report here should not have been found.
Regulatory agency guideline testing methods cannot be expected to detect alterations in
metabolism that, although not overtly toxic, can initiate or exacerbate metabolic dis-
orders. Despite these limitations, the absence of such experimental data demonstrating
causality has been considered adequate for regulatory decision-making about the safety
of BPA, while numerous findings from human epidemiology cross-sectional and pro-
spective studies have been ignored [16].
This study is an initial step toward investigation of an intriguing hypothesis that
exposure to estrogenic chemicals such as BPA may contribute to insulin resistance by
triggering an innate insulin resistance mechanism. We thus assume that other estro-
genic endocrine-disrupting chemicals, such as other bisphenols [37], could interact with
BPA to impact glucose homeostasis. In late pregnancy, women develop a temporary
insulin resistance, which enables increased glucose transfer across the placenta and
rapid fetal growth [1]. This insulin resistance is believed to be caused by increases in
steroid and other hormones during pregnancy [38]. Although estrogens at typical
premenopausal levels appear to promote insulin sensitivity and protect the endocrine
pancreas, estrogen excess appears to cause impairment of glucose control and create
insulin resistance [39]. In male mice, repeated exposure to a low dose of BPA for 4 days
produced insulin resistance [3]. If humans are similarly responsive, and the effect is primarily
mediated through extranuclear estrogen receptors that respond to BPA at 100 pM to 1 nM
(228 pg/mL) concentrations [4, 6], this would predict that insulin resistance and type 2 di-
abetes can be exacerbated by BPA exposures and therefore be improved by reducing
such exposures.
Given these implications, verification of our findings in this exploratory study is
clearly required. The findings from our OGTT experiment were strong (Fig. 2), but the
effects of BPA on glucose control are likely far more complex than a simple function of
HbA1c and BPA exposure. Background endogenous estrogen levels may matter, and
these vary by age in men and in premenopausal females by monthly cycling or use of
hormonal contraceptives, as well as in relation to BMI [40]. The serum uBPA levels are
important as well, because hormones and hormonally active chemicals like BPA may have
nonmonotonic dose-response relationships whereby very high chemical concentrations shut
down the systems that are stimulated at lower concentrations, and entirely different responses
are activated [6, 35]. There was considerable between-subject variability in the serum levels of
uBPA (Fig. 3; Table 4), which could be related to differences in the degree to which different
subjects absorbed BPA sublingually vs enterally [41] as well as other factors such as age
(Supplemental Fig. 6).
In summary, the results of our two experiments suggest that oral exposure to the ubiquitous
environmental contaminant BPA at the Environmental Protection Agency–estimated “safe”
daily (reference) dose alters the insulin/C-peptide response to a glucose challenge in adults.
Importantly, the effect of BPA on insulin and C-peptide occurred at an internal dose of serum
uBPA that could plausibly result from real-world exposures, which for some persons might
occur multiple times each day [18, 20]. A growing experimental literature suggests that BPA
and other endocrine-disrupting chemicals may meaningfully contribute to the etiology of
metabolic diseases [1, 2]. If true, it implies that susceptible people might improve with reduced
exposure to BPA and other bisphenols that are functionally similar [37]. These findings suggest
new research directions into the causes and treatment of glucose dysregulation.
