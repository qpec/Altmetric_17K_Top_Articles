compression garments enhance the active recovery process
after high-intensity running? J Strength Cond Res 25(12):
3264–3268, 2011—This study examined the effect of wearing
waist-to-ankle compression garments (CGs) on active recovery
after moderate- and high-intensity submaximal treadmill running.
Twenty-five
male
semiprofessional
rugby
league
players
performed two 30-minute treadmill runs comprising of six
5-minute stages at 6 km�h21, 10 km�h21, approximately 85%
_
VO2max, 6 km�h21 as a recovery stage followed by approximately
85% _
VO2max and 6 km�h21 wearing either CGs or regular
running shorts in a randomized counterbalanced order with each
person acting as his own control. All stages were followed by
30 seconds of rest during which a blood sample was collected
to determine blood pH and blood lactate concentration [La2].
Expired gases and heart rate (HR) were measured during the
submaximal treadmill tests to determine metabolic variables with
the average of the last 2 minutes used for data analysis. The HR
and [La2] were lower (p # 0.05) after the first and second
6 km�h21 recovery bouts when wearing CGs compared with
when wearing running shorts. The respiratory exchange ratio
(RER) was higher and [La2] lower (p # 0.05) after the
10 km�h21 stage, and only RER was higher after both 85%
_
VO2max stages when wearing CGs compared with when
wearing running shorts. There was no difference in blood pH at
any exercise stage when wearing the CGs and running shorts.
The results of this study indicate that the wearing of CGs may
augment the active recovery process in reducing [La2] and HR
after high-intensity exercise but not effect blood pH. The ability
to reduce [La2] and HR has important consequences for many
sports that are intermittent in nature and consist of repeated
bouts of high-intensity exercise interspersed with periods of
low-intensity exercise or recovery.

INTRODUCTION
M
any sports involve periods of high-intensity
exercise interspersed with periods of low-
intensity exercise or recovery. It is during the
periods of low-intensity exercise that athletes
look to maximize their recovery, in particular by reducing
blood lactate concentration [La2] and blood pH, which has
been shown to affect subsequent performance (8,16). Various
methods have been implemented to facilitate the removal of
lactate during recovery such as active and passive recoveries
(15,23), massage (24), ergogenic aids (6), and cold water
immersion therapy (31). More recently, the wearing of
compression garments (CGs) has been suggested as a possible
method that may aid in an athlete’s recovery after high-
intensity training and competition (11,22).
Although CGs have been used clinically for years in the
treatment and therapy of a number of pathological conditions
(26), it is only recently that the potential benefit of CGs in
enhancing sports performance has been recognized (7,21,22).
One possible benefit for enhancing performance is the
increased venous return from the compression of superficial
veins and improved capillary filtration, which may reduce
venous pooling in the lower limbs during and after exercise
(25,26). This is achieved by applying a pressure gradient
which is the highest in the ankle region and lowest in the
upper thigh. As a result, the increase in blood flow is thought
to aid in the removal of waste products and allow a quicker
return to blood gas homeostasis (11).
Despite the increased use of CGs as a method of recovery (2),
previous studies have produced conflicting results regarding
the potential benefit of CGs during exercise and recovery
(1,4,5,11,13,14,21). One of the earliest studies (4) to compare
the effect of CGs on postexercise [La2] found no difference in
[La2] after 3 minutes of high-intensity treadmill running with
and without CGs. However, technological advances in the

 materials used in the manufacture of CGs may provide more
optimal compression and more measurable positive benefits
than earlier CGs (22). More recently, CGs worn during 40
minutes of treadmill running (80% maximal oxygen uptake) by
elite runners also produced no change in [La2] compared with
control values despite participants being blinded as to whether
they were wearing the control (no pressure), low pressure, or
high pressure CG (1). However, [La2] produced during the
treadmill test only reached maximal values of 3.9 6 1.4
mmol�L21, which may not have been sufficiently high for the
CGs to have a positive effect on [La2]. Other studies (5,10) that
have found reduced [La2] postexercise have used a variety of
recovery methods in conjunction with the CGs that may have
confounded the results. The effect of wearing CGs on
postexercise recovery and [La2] remains unclear. The use of
CGs during recovery may assist in reducing edema and
enhancing venous return during active recovery (22). This may
in return help reduce [La2] and the heart rate (HR) during the
recovery process. We therefore hypothesized that the use of
CGs in conjunction with active recovery would enhance the
‘‘muscle pump’’ allowing blood to return to the heart for
a greater removal of lactate and lower the HR after high-
intensity exercise. Thus, the purpose of this study was to
examine the effect of CGs on active postexercise recovery after
a bout of high-intensity exercise.
METHODS
Experimental Approach to the Problem
The use of CGs as an aid to sporting performance has become
increasingly popular in recent years. However, despite their
widespread use, there is little evidence regarding the ability of
CGs to reduce [La2] and blood pH during active recovery
and enhance subsequent performance between bouts of high-
intensity running. This study examined the physiological
effects of wearing CGs and a control condition in which
regular running shorts were worn on moderate- and high-
intensity treadmill running before and after active (walking)
recovery. Elite semiprofessional rugby players who encoun-
ter similar high-intensity exercise and recovery periods
during competitive match play were used in this study.
Selected physiologically dependent measures that included
HR, _
VO2, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), [La2], and blood
pH were recorded and analyzed to determine the effect of
wearing CGs. These results were then compared with those
of the control condition of wearing regular running shorts.
Based on the findings of previous studies (5,10), it was
hypothesized that wearing CGs would enhance the active
recovery process and result in lower HR, [La2], and blood
pH during recovery.
Subjects
Twenty-six semiprofessional rugby league players with
a mean 6 SD age 21.6 6 2.5 years, height 182.2 6 6.1 cm,
and weight 92.6 6 7.7 kg had the experimental risks of the
study explained to them and subsequently gave written
informed consent to participate. Ethics approval was granted
by The University of the Sunshine Coast Ethics Committee.
The players had participated in rugby league for 13. 3 6
3.3 years and regularly performed 3–5 training sessions per
week consisting of aerobic interval, anaerobic interval,
resistance training, and team skills training. Testing took
place after preseason training and before the commencement
of regular match competition.
Procedures
Participants attended 3 testing sessions separated by 7 days
and were advised to avoid exercise and the consumption of
alcohol 24 hours before testing and to avoid food and caffeine
3 hours before testing. A food and training log was kept by
participants 24 hours before testing for compliance and to
ensure a similar routine before the subsequent testing session.
The study comprised a randomized counterbalanced within-
study design with each participant acting as his control, and
involving a test session with regular running shorts and with
lower body CGs during exercise and recovery.
Waist-to-ankle CGs (Body Science, Gold Coast, Australia)
with decreasing pressure from the ankle to the hips were
individually fitted to each participant to ensure that the correct
pressure was applied to the lower body in accordance with
the manufacturer’s recommendations (Figure 1). A pressure
bladder (Kikuhime BG3792, Advancis Medical, Nottingham,
United Kingdom) was placed beneath the skin and the CG
at the ankle and calf with the pressure measurement taken in

 the standing position. This procedure was repeated at the end
of the submaximal treadmill testing to ensure that no change in
pressure occurred during the exercise bout.
Physiological Testing
The first session involved participants performing a graded
exercise test on a treadmill (Woodway, Waukesha, WI, USA)
to determine their cardiovascular fitness ( _
VO2max). The initial
speed was set at 8 km�h21, and the speed increased by
1 km�h21 every 1 minute until 14 km�h21 with the grade
increasing thereafter until exhaustion.
Cardiorespiratory-metabolic variables were measured using
open
circuit spirometry (Parvo-Medics TrueOne�
2400
Metabolic Measurement System, Sandy, UT, USA). The HR
was measured via an HR monitor (Polar S610 HR Monitor,
Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland) strapped against the
participant’s chest. During the progressive exercise test, each
participant was encouraged to give a maximal effort. Maximal
values for oxygen consumption were calculated from the
average of the last minute of exercise before volitional fatigue.
_
VO2max was confirmed when 3 or more of the following
criteria were met: (a) a plateau in _
VO2 despite an increase in
running intensity; (b) an RER . 1.20; (c) an HR within 10
b�min21 of its predicted maximum; (d) a lactate concentration
.10 m�mol�L21.
The second and third tests involved participants completing
a 6-stage submaximal treadmill test, which consisted of 5-minute
stages at 6 km�h21, 10 km�h21, approximately 85% of _
VO2max,
and 6 km�h21 as a recovery stage followed by approximately
85% _
VO2max and 6 km�h21. All stages were followed by 30
seconds of rest during which 80 mL of blood was taken from the
fingertip for subsequent analysis. The first 75 mL of blood was
used to determine blood pH (Radiometer ABL 80, Melbourne,
Australia) with the remainder of the blood used to determine
[La2] (Lactate Pro, Arkray, Japan). Expired gases and HR
were measured during the submaximal treadmill tests to deter-
mine metabolic variables with the average of the last 2 minutes
of the 5-minute stages averaged and used for data analysis.
Participants completed 1 test wearing the CGs and the other
test wearing their normal playing shorts.
Statistical Analyses
TheStatisticalPackageforthe Social Sciences (SPSS Version17.0)
was used for all analyses. Based on previous research (1,11,22)
and data from our laboratory involving CGs and exercise,
a minimum sample size of 22 was established to achieve a
statistical power of 90%. For dependent variables used in this
study, the intraclass correlation coefficient was R $ 0.89.
A paired t-test was used to determine differences in physiological
variables between the conditions (CGs vs. no CGs) at each stage

 of the treadmill exercise with the significance level set at
p # 0.05. Data are reported as means and SDs (M 6 SD).
RESULTS
Of the 26 participants who began the study, 1 withdrew
because of injury occurring during match play unrelated to
this study. The participants were individually fitted with CGs
to ensure that the level of compression was within the
manufacturer’s recommendations. The average compression
was 20 6 2 mm Hg at the ankle and 15 6 2 mm Hg at the calf.
There was no difference between CGs and running shorts for
any physiological measures after the first 5 minutes of treadmill
walking at 6 km�h21. After the next 5 minutes of treadmill
running at 10 km�h21, RER values were higher and [La2]
lower (p , 0.05) when wearing CGs compared with when
wearing running shorts. After both 5-minute treadmill runs at
85% of _
VO2max, RER values were higher (p , 0.05) when
wearing CGs compared with when wearing running shorts. At
the completion of the first and second recovery stages at
6 km�h21, HR (p , 0.05) and [La2] (p , 0.05) were lower
when wearing CGs compared with when wearing running
shorts (Table 1). There was no difference in blood pH when
wearing CGs compared with when wearing running shorts, at
any stage of the treadmill exercise.
DISCUSSION
The main finding of this study was that [La2] and HR were
lower when wearing CGs during active recovery after a bout
of high-intensity running compared with values obtained
when wearing regular running shorts. Additionally, CGs
reduced [La2] at 10 km�h21 during submaximal treadmill
running compared with when wearing running shorts. The
ability to reduce [La2] has important consequences for many
sports that are intermittent in nature and consist of repeated
bouts of high-intensity exercise interspersed with periods of
low-intensity exercise or recovery.
Although some studies (5,10) have reported lower [La2]
when comparing CGs with running shorts after exercise,
most have reported no change in [La2] immediately after
high-intensity treadmill running (1,30), simulated game
conditions (19), and high-intensity shuttle tests (20). Equally,
we found no significant difference in [La2] immediately after
high-intensity treadmill running (;85% _
VO2max) but did find
lower [La2] after active recovery when wearing CGs.
However, the lower [La2] was not associated with any
difference in blood pH between wearing CGs and running
shorts (Table 1). Although traditionally lactate was thought
to be the primary cause of metabolic acidosis, recent
evidence has suggested that changes in blood pH are
because of other metabolic by-products and not because of
changes in [La2] (27). The lack of association between blood
pH and [La2] may explain the differences found in this study.
The results of this study indicate that the wearing of CGs may
assist the active recovery process in reducing [La2] after high-
intensity exercise. The skeletal muscle pump during active
recovery has been shown to facilitate the return of blood from
the lower extremities by rhythmic muscle contractions creating
intramuscular pressure oscillations, which increase blood flow
and venous return (28). The specific design of the CGs used in
this study may have also assisted in the pushing of edema from
the damaged muscle tissue back into circulation, increasing the
returning blood flow (22). The increased blood flow is believed
to enhance the removal of lactate from the exercising muscle
allowing a faster redistribution to alternative metabolism sites
such as the liver, heart, and nonworking muscles (3) and
increase CO2 delivery to the lungs (12). The high-intensity
exercise bout in this study produced RERvalues .1.0 indicating
a greater contribution of lactate buffering to the CO2 being
expelled from the lungs. This view is supported by the [La2]
measured during the high-intensity bout (.6.0 mmol�L21).
Interestingly, RER values measured during the 10 km�h21 and
85% _
VO2max treadmill run were higher in participants wearing
CGs compared with in those wearing running shorts, suggesting
a greater release of CO2 from the buffering of lactate while
wearing CGs. Although there was no difference in [La2] at 85%
_
VO2max between wearing CGs and wearing running shorts,
during the 10 km�h21 treadmill run, participants wearing the
CGs had lower [La2]. Plasma [La2] has been shown to be the
most significant determinant of RER at submaximal workloads
similar to the 10 km�h21 used in this study (17). Possibly, the lack
of difference in [La2] at 85% _
VO2max may have been because of
the higher concentration of lactate masking the effectiveness of
CGs at the higher intensity. However, there was no difference in
RER during the active recovery despite there being lower [La2]
in participants wearing the CGs, indicating a delay in the
relationship between [La2] and metabolic measurements from
expired gases. Previous studies (18,29) have also reported a delay
in the adjustments in CO2 balance, which may in turn take the
RER several minutes to reach baseline values during recovery.
Therefore, the higher RER values found for the participants
wearing CGs in this study during the high-intensity treadmill
run may have influenced their lower [La2] during the recovery
process.
The HR was also lower when wearing CGs during active
recovery compared with that when wearing running shorts.
This may have been because of the augmented skeletal muscle
pump and increased venous return previously mentioned,
lowering HR during the active recovery. The changes in HR
and subsequent cardiac output seen during recovery from
exercise have been shown to be primarily because of the
muscle pump maintaining central blood volume and not
because of central command (9). Therefore, the combined
effect of lower limb compression and the skeletal pump
during active recovery appears to result in a lower HR during
recovery when wearing CGs.
In conclusion [La2] and HR are lower when wearing CGs
during active recovery after a bout of high-intensity treadmill
running compared with when wearing regular running shorts.
This is thought to be because of CGs assisting the muscle
pump associated with active recovery and enhancing blood

 flow and venous return. The RER values measured during the
10 km�h21 and 85% _
VO2max treadmill run were higher in
participants wearing CGs compared with when wearing
running shorts, suggesting a greater release of CO2 from the
buffering of lactate while wearing CGs.
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
The practical applications of this study demonstrate the
efficacy of wearing a waist-to-ankle CG during active
recovery between bouts of high-intensity running. Reductions
in blood lactate and HR during active recovery may assist in
the recovery of an athlete in the preparation for their next
bout
of
high-intensity
exercise.
Coaches
and
athletes
associated with sports that involve high-intensity intermittent
exercise may use CGs to assist in their recovery process and
therefore improve subsequent performance.
