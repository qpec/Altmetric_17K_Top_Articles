SUMMARY
The diverse malignant, stromal, and immune cells in tumors affect growth, metastasis and 
response to therapy. We profiled transcriptomes of ~6,000 single cells from 18 head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, including five matched pairs of primary tumors and 
lymph node metastases. Stromal and immune cells had consistent expression programs across 
patients. Conversely, malignant cells varied within and between tumors in their expression of 
signatures related to cell cycle, stress, hypoxia, epithelial differentiation, and partial epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition (p-EMT). Cells expressing the p-EMT program spatially localized to the 
leading edge of primary tumors. By integrating single-cell transcriptomes with bulk expression 
profiles for hundreds of tumors, we refined HNSCC subtypes by their malignant and stromal

INTRODUCTION
Genomic and transcriptomic studies have revealed driver mutations, aberrant regulatory 
programs, and disease subtypes for major human tumors (Stratton et al., 2009; Weinberg, 
2014). However, these studies relied on profiling technologies that measure tumors in bulk, 
limiting their ability to capture intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Substantial evidence indicates 
that intra-tumoral heterogeneity among malignant and non-malignant cells, and their 
interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME) are critical to diverse aspects of 
tumor biology (Meacham and Morrison, 2013; Weinberg, 2014).
Recent advances in single-cell genomics provide an avenue to explore genetic and functional 
heterogeneity at a cellular resolution (Navin, 2015; Tanay and Regev, 2017). Single-cell 
RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) studies of human tumors, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and patient-
derived xenografts have revealed new insights into tumor composition, cancer stem cells, 
and drug resistance. However, scRNA-seq studies have not deeply characterized epithelial 
tumors, despite their predominance. In these tumors, metastasis to draining lymph nodes 
(locoregional metastasis) and other organs (distant metastasis) represents a major cause of 
morbidity and mortality. Metastases are often treated based on molecular and pathologic 
features of the primary tumor, raising the question of whether they share the same genetics, 
epigenetics, and vulnerabilities. However, the potentially different composition of primary 
tumors and metastases hinders the straightforward comparison of bulk tumor profiles. 
Single-cell expression profiling studies would, in principle, offer a compelling alternative.
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been suggested as a driver of epithelial 
tumor spread (Gupta and Massague, 2006; Lambert et al., 2017). The process of EMT is 
fundamental to embryonic development and may be co-opted by malignant epithelial cells to 
facilitate invasion and dissemination (Thiery et al., 2009; Ye and Weinberg, 2015). EMT 
markers have been detected on CTCs associated with metastatic disease (Ting et al., 2014; 
Yu et al., 2013). However, since most EMT studies have focused on laboratory models, the 
extent and significance of EMT in primary human tumors and metastases remains 
controversial (Lambert et al., 2017; Nieto et al., 2016). Moreover, while mesenchymal 
subtypes have been identified for certain tumors (Cancer Genome Atlas, 2015; Cancer 
Genome Atlas Research, 2011; Verhaak et al., 2010), it remains unclear whether they reflect 
mesenchymal cancer cells or, alternatively, contributions of non-malignant mesenchymal 
cell types in the TME.

 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a heterogeneous epithelial tumor with 
strong associations to alcohol and tobacco exposure (Puram and Rocco, 2015). Metastatic 
disease remains a central challenge, with patients often presenting at advanced stages with 
LN metastases. Here, we investigate primary HNSCC tumors and matched LNs to better 
understand intra-tumoral heterogeneity, invasion, and metastasis. Transcriptional profiles for 
~6,000 cells from 18 patients revealed expression programs that distinguish diverse 
malignant, stromal, and immune cells. Malignant cells varied in their expression of cell 
cycle, stress, hypoxia and epithelial differentiation programs. A subset of cells also 
expressed a partial EMT (p-EMT) program with extracellular matrix proteins, but lacking 
classical EMT transcription factors (TFs). p-EMT cells localized to the leading edge of 
primary tumors in proximity to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). We used this 
knowledge of the HNSCC ecosystem to re-evaluate bulk RNA-seq data from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA). This revealed new insight into HNSCC expression subtypes, and 
established the p-EMT program as an independent predictor of adverse clinical features, 
including invasion and metastasis.
RESULTS
A single-cell expression atlas of HNSCC primary tumors and metastases
To explore the cellular diversity in HNSCC tumors, we focused on oral cavity tumors, the 
most common subsite of HNSCC. We generated full-length scRNA-seq profiles for primary 
tumors from 18 treatment-naïve patients and for matching LN metastasis from five of these 
patients (Figure 1; Tables S1 and S2). We also acquired whole exome sequencing (WES) 
and targeted genotyping (SNaPshot) data for these tumors, which demonstrated a range of 
putative driver mutations and chromosomal aberrations (Figure S1B; Tables S3 and S4), 
consistent with established HNSCC genetics (Agrawal et al., 2011; Cancer Genome Atlas, 
2015; Stransky et al., 2011).
We retained single-cell transcriptomes for 5,902 cells from 18 patients after initial quality 
controls (Figure S1A). We confidently distinguished 2,215 malignant and 3,363 non-
malignant cells by three complementary approaches. First, we inferred large-scale 
chromosomal copy-number variations (CNVs) in each single cell based on averaged 
expression profiles across chromosomal intervals (Muller et al., 2016; Patel et al., 2014; 
Tirosh et al., 2016b). These inferred CNVs, which were consistent with WES (Figures 1B, 
S1B, and S1C), separated malignant cells from non-malignant cells with normal karyotypes. 
Second, we distinguished malignant cells by their epithelial origin, which differs from 
stromal and immune cells in the TME (Figure 1C). We found remarkable concordance 
between cells with epithelial marker expression and cells with aberrant karyotypes (Figure 
1D). Finally, we partitioned cells to preliminary clusters by their global expression patterns. 
The vast majority of cells were part of clusters with concordant malignant or non-malignant 
classifications, based on CNV and epithelial marker analyses (Figure S1D).
Landscape of expression heterogeneity in head and neck cancer
Single-cell profiles of non-malignant cells highlighted the composition of the TME. We 
partitioned the 3,363 non-malignant cells to eight main clusters by their expression states

 (Figures 2A, S1E, S1F and S2H). We annotated clusters by the expression of known marker 
genes as T-cells, B/plasma cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, endothelial cells, 
fibroblasts, and myocytes (Figure S1F). Notably, each of the clusters contained cells from 
different patients, indicating that cell types and expression states in the TME are consistent 
across HNSCC tumors and do not represent patient-specific subpopulations or batch effects, 
though they do vary in their proportions.
We found further diversity within both T-cells and fibroblasts through finer clustering, 
powered by their relatively large numbers in our dataset (Figure 2B). The main T-cell cluster 
(~1,000 T-cells) can be partitioned into four sub-clusters (Figures 2B and S2A), which we 
annotated as regulatory T-cells (Tregs), conventional CD4+ T-helper cells (CD4+ Tconv), and 
two cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell populations (CD8+ T and CD8+ Texhausted). The cytotoxic 
subsets differed in expression of co-inhibitory receptors (e.g. PD1, CTLA4) and other genes 
associated with T-cell dysfunction and exhaustion, and thereby defined a putative T-cell 
exhaustion program in HNSCC (Figures 2B and S2A). Proportions of exhausted CD8+ T-
cells varied significantly among patients in our cohort (Figure S2B). These T-cell expression 
states may inform efforts to understand and predict responses to checkpoint 
immunotherapies (Mellman et al., 2011).
Despite significant interest, the regulatory states of fibroblasts in human tumors remain 
obscure. The ~1,500 fibroblasts partitioned into two main subsets (Figure 2B, black and 
blue), and a third minor subset (Figures 2B, brown, S2C and S2D). One subset expressed 
classical markers of myofibroblasts, including alpha smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) and 
myosin light chain proteins (MYLK, MYL9). Myofibroblasts are an established component 
of the TME and have been linked to wound healing and contracture (Rockey et al., 2013). A 
second subset expressed receptors, ligands, and extracellular matrix (ECM) genes, including 
fibroblast activation protein (FAP), podoplanin (PDPN), and connective tissue growth factor 
(CTGF), that have been associated with CAFs (Madar et al., 2013). The third subset was 
depleted of markers for myofibroblasts and CAFs and may represent resting fibroblasts. 
These diverse fibroblast expression states were reproducibly detected across tumors, and 
may thus represent common features of the HNSCC TME.
Although the cellular identity and origin of CAFs has been ascribed to various lineages 
(Madar et al., 2013), the subpopulations we detect are highly consistent with a fibroblast 
identity. Further analysis partitioned CAFs into two subsets (CAF1 and CAF2) with 
differential expression of immediate early response genes (e.g. JUN, FOS), mesenchymal 
markers (e.g. VIM, THY1), ligands and receptors (e.g. FGF7, TGFBR2/3), and ECM 
proteins (e.g. MMP11, CAV1) (Figures S2D and S2E; Table S5). This intra-tumoral 
fibroblast heterogeneity is consistent with the view that CAFs are involved in complex 
structural and paracrine interactions in the TME.
In contrast to non-malignant cells, the 2,215 malignant cells clustered according to their 
tumor of origin (Figures 2C and S2H). Over 2,000 genes were preferentially expressed in 
individual tumors (Figure 2D). Differentially-expressed genes were enriched within CNVs 
that vary between tumors (Figure S2F and S2G). Other differences relate to tumor subtypes 
(see ‘HNSCC subtypes…’, below). For example, genes associated with detoxification and

 drug metabolism (e.g. GPX2, GSTMs, CYPs, ABCC1) were preferentially expressed by the 
two classical subtype tumors in our cohort (MEEI6 and MEEI20; Figure 2D). Finally, other 
differentially expressed genes relate to stress (e.g. JUNB, FOSL1) or immune activation 
(e.g. IDO1, STAT1, TNF), potentially in response to varied TMEs. Thus, inter-tumoral 
malignant cell expression heterogeneity reflects differences in genetics, subtypes, and TME 
between tumors in our cohort.
Intra-tumoral expression heterogeneity of the malignant compartment
We next explored how expression states varied among different malignant cells within the 
same tumor, focusing on 10 tumors from which the largest numbers of malignant cell 
transcriptomes were acquired. We used non-negative matrix factorization to uncover 
coherent sets of genes that were preferentially co-expressed by subsets of malignant cells. 
For example, we defined six gene signatures that vary among malignant cells of MEEI25 
(Figures 3A and S2I; Table S6). Applying the approach to each of the 10 tumors defined a 
total of 60 gene signatures that coherently vary across individual cells in at least one tumor 
(Table S6). Next, we used hierarchical clustering to distill these 60 signatures into meta-
signatures that reflect common expression programs that vary within multiple tumors 
(Figures 3B, S3A and S3B; Table S6 and S7). The high concordance between signatures 
from different tumors suggests that they reflect common patterns of intra-tumoral expression 
heterogeneity.
Seven expression programs were preferentially expressed by subsets of malignant cells in at 
least two tumors. Two programs (clusters 1,2 in Figures 3A and 3B) reflected the G1/S and 
G2/M phases of the cell cycle and distinguished cycling cells in each tumor (14–40% of 
cells in different tumors) (Figure S3A; Table S7). A third program (cluster 6 in Figures 3A 
and 3B) consisted of JUN, FOS, and immediate early genes implicated in cellular activation 
and stress responses (Figure S3A; Table S7). A fourth program was enriched for hypoxia-
related genes and increased in HNSCC cells cultured in hypoxic conditions (Figures 3B, 
S3A and S5Q; Table S7).
Two additional programs (clusters 4,5 in Figures 3A and 3B) consisted primarily of 
epithelial genes, such as EPCAM, cytokeratins (e.g. KRT6, 16, 17, 75), and kallikreins 
(KLK5-11) (Figure S3A; Table S7). While all malignant cells expressed epithelial markers, 
many of which were largely uniform across malignant cells (Figures 1C, 1D and S3E), 
expression of these particular epithelial genes varied coherently across malignant cells 
(Figure S3D), and may reflect the degree of epithelial differentiation. A final expression 
program (cluster 3 in Figures 3A and 3B) contained genes associated with ECM and had 
features of EMT (Figure S3A; Table S7). This program was evident in subsets of cells from 
seven of the ten tumors examined (Figure S3B).
A partial EMT program in HNSCC
Although EMT programs have been widely considered as potential drivers of drug 
resistance, invasion, and metastasis, their patterns and significance in human epithelial 
tumors in vivo remains unclear (Nieto et al., 2016; Thiery et al., 2009; Ye and Weinberg, 
2015). We therefore closely examined the ECM program for features of EMT. In addition to 
Puram et al.

 ECM genes such as matrix metalloproteinases, laminins and integrins, this program included 
the EMT markers vimentin (VIM) and integrin α-5 (ITGA5) (Figures 3A, 3C, S3A and 
S3C; Table S7). Moreover, one of the top scoring genes in this program was TGFβ-induced 
(TGFBI), implicating the classic EMT regulator TGFβ (Figure S3C).
While the program had key features of classical EMT, it lacked other hallmarks. First, 
although the signature was accompanied by reduced expression of certain epithelial genes, 
overall expression of epithelial markers was clearly maintained (Figures S3D and S3E). 
Second, we did not detect expression of the classical EMT TFs, ZEB1/2, TWIST1/2 and 
SNAIL1. Only SNAIL2 was detected (in 70% of HNSCC cells), and while its expression 
correlated with the program across tumors, it did not correlate with the program across 
individual cells within a tumor (Figure S3F). Recent work suggests that SNAIL2 peaks 
earlier than other EMT TFs (van Dijk et al., Pre-print, 2017). SNAIL2 is also implicated in a 
partial EMT response in wound healing (Savagner et al., 2005). We note that EMT is 
increasingly recognized to be a continuous and variable process (Lambert et al., 2017; 
Lundgren et al., 2009; Nieto et al., 2016). We therefore suggest that the in vivo program 
identified here reflects a partial EMT-like state or ‘p-EMT’. Several additional analyses 
demonstrate that that this p-EMT program is distinct from full EMT programs derived from 
cell lines and tumor models, as well as from “Mesenchymal” signatures derived from bulk 
tumor profiles (Figures S4A–D) (Cancer Genome Atlas, 2015; Tan et al., 2014).
In vitro p-EMT cells are dynamic and invasive
We investigated the functional significance of the p-EMT program across five HNSCC cell 
lines. Expression profiles of 501 cells were largely distinct from human tumors (Figure 
S3G). However, a subset of cells in SCC9, an oral cavity-derived line, partially recapitulated 
the in vivo p-EMT program (Figure S3H). When these p-EMThigh cells were isolated by 
flow cytometry, they demonstrated increased invasiveness (Figures 3D and 3E). They also 
had a decreased proliferation rate (Figure 3F), consistent with scRNA-seq analysis of patient 
samples (Figure S4E) and prior EMT studies (Nieto et al., 2016; Ye and Weinberg, 2015).
Prior studies suggested that early stages of EMT may be transitional or metastable (Lambert 
et al., 2017; Lundgren et al., 2009; Nieto et al., 2016). We therefore considered whether p-
EMT might reflect a transient state in dynamic equilibrium with more epithelial 
subpopulations. To test this, we sorted p-EMThigh and p-EMTlow cells from SCC9, cultured 
them, and re-assessed marker expression. The two populations remained distinct 4 hours and 
24 hours after sorting (t-test, p<0.0001; Figure S4H) but became indistinguishable after 4 
days of culture, with both cultures recapitulating the distribution of marker expression in 
unsorted SCC9 cells (Figures 3G, 3H and S4H). The dynamic nature of this in vitro program 
raises the possibility that the in vivo p-EMT program may also represent a transient state.
p-EMT cells localize to the leading edge in proximity to CAFs
Taken together, our in vivo profiles and in vitro functional data suggest the p-EMT program 
is dynamic, invasive, and potentially responsive to TME cues. This led us to investigate the 
in situ spatial localization of cells expressing this program within HNSCC tumors. We used 
immunohistochemistry to stain a collection of tumors for the top genes in the p-EMT

 program (PDPN, LAMC2, LAMB3, MMP10, TGFBI and ITGA5), along with the HNSCC 
marker p63 (Figures 4A, 4B and S5A–D). These experiments revealed a population of 
malignant cells that co-stain for p-EMT markers and localize to the leading edge of tumors 
in close apposition to surrounding stroma. Tumors that lacked the p-EMT program per 
scRNA-seq did not stain for these markers (Figures S5E–G). In contrast, epithelial 
differentiation markers (SPRR1B, CLDN4) stained a distinct set of cells at the core of 
tumors (Figures 4C and S5H–K), consistent with the negative correlation between these 
programs in scRNA-seq data (Figure 4D).
The localization of the p-EMT program to the leading edge prompted us to consider 
interactions with the TME, such as ligand-receptor signaling. We inferred putative tumor-
stromal interactions based on high expression of a ligand by one cell type and a 
corresponding receptor by another cell type (Ramilowski et al., 2015). This predicted 
“outgoing” signals from malignant cells to the various TME cell types in similar proportions 
(Figure 4E). Conversely, when we considered “incoming” signals to malignant cells, we 
found that CAFs expressed notably higher numbers of ligands that correspond to receptors 
expressed by the malignant cells of the corresponding tumor (hypergeometric test, p<0.05; 
Figures 4E and S5L). These included interactions that may promote EMT, such as TGFB3-
TGFBR2, FGF7-FGFR2 and CXCL12-CXCR7 (Figure 4F) (Moustakas and Heldin, 2016; 
Ranieri et al., 2016; Yao et al., 2016). Accordingly, when we stained tumors for CAF 
markers (FAP, PDPN), we found that CAFs were present near p-EMT cells at the leading 
edge (Figures 4C and S5M).
To evaluate the functional significance of the ligand-receptor interactions, we treated SCC9 
cells with TGFβ. Four hours of exposure induced a p-EMT-like program, which was 
repressed upon inhibition of TGFβ (t-test, p<10−16; Figures 4G and 4H). TGFβ treatment 
also increased invasiveness and reduced proliferation, while inhibition had opposite effects 
(ANOVA, p<0.0001; Figures 4I and S5N). In addition, overexpression of TGFBI, a known 
target of TGFβ and the top p-EMT gene, led to similar effects on invasiveness and 
proliferation (t-test, p<0.005 and ANOVA, p<0.0001, respectively; Figures S4F and S4G). 
Conversely, genetic inactivation of TGFBI abrogated the TGFβ response (ANOVA, 
p<0.0001; Figure S5O and S5P). Although we sought to test CAFs from primary tumors in 
co-culture, we found that cultured fibroblasts lost expression of typical activation markers 
and ligands (Figure 4F) and failed to induce a p-EMT response in co-cultured cancer cells 
(Figure S5R). Taken together, these data suggest that paracrine interactions between CAFs 
and malignant cells promote a p-EMT program at the leading edge of HNSCC tumors with 
potential roles in tumor invasion.
Intra-tumoral HNSCC heterogeneity recapitulated in locoregional metastases
To gain further insight into potential determinants of HNSCC spread, we compared LN 
metastases to primary tumors. Although WES and inferred CNVs revealed some genetic 
differences between primary and matched LN samples, they did not identify any distinctions 
that were consistent, possibly due to the small number of individuals studied (Figures S1B, 
S1C and S6A).
Puram et al.

 The expression profiles of malignant cells in LNs also largely matched the corresponding 
primary tumors (Figure 5A). Few differentially-expressed genes were evident for each 
matched pair, and they were not consistent across the cohort (Figure S6B). The existence of 
p-EMT high and low subpopulations was also consistent between primary tumors and LNs 
of all patients, though their prevalence differed between sites (Figures S6C and S6D). These 
findings raise the possibility that programs required for LN metastasis are dynamic and 
hence undetected in comparisons of primary tumors and LNs. Indeed, prior studies have also 
failed to detect genetic or transcriptional distinctions between tumors and locoregional 
metastases (Colella et al., 2008).
We also observed an overall concordance in the identity and representation of stromal and 
immune cells in LNs and matched primary tumors, albeit with some important distinctions. 
Although most clusters contained cells from both sites, myocytes were observed only in 
primary tumors and B/plasma cells were found only in LNs (Figure 5B). Fibroblast subsets 
were also differentially represented: LN fibroblasts were enriched for myofibroblasts and the 
CAF1 subtype (hypergeometric test; p<0.05), and preferentially expressed certain receptors 
and ligands (e.g. IL1R1, MMP11, SPARC) (Figures 5B, S2E and S6E). These differences 
support an altered signaling environment in the LN, but suggest that the TME remains 
largely stable upon locoregional metastasis.
These findings prompted us to examine the histology of LN specimens, using the markers 
described above. We found largely intact epithelial structures or ‘nests’ of malignant cells 
(Figures S6F and S6G) with p-EMT markers at their periphery, surrounded by CAFs and 
other TME components. These observations are consistent with a ‘collective migration’ 
model (Clark and Vignjevic, 2015; Lambert et al., 2017), where malignant and stromal cells 
move in clusters to spread lymphatogenously and form LN metastases. Alternatively, 
individual cells may disseminate and engraft at the same site (‘single-cell dissemination’), 
thereby recapitulating primary tumor heterogeneity within LN metastases.
HNSCC subtypes refined by deconvolution of bulk expression data
We next considered the generality and prognostic significance of the malignant and stromal 
expression programs identified from our scRNA-seq data. A recent TCGA study analyzed 
expression profiles for hundreds of HNSCC tumors, and classified them into four subtypes: 
basal, mesenchymal, classical, and atypical (Cancer Genome Atlas, 2015). Although the 
TCGA profiles were acquired from bulk tumors, we reasoned that expression programs of 
individual cellular components might enable us to extract additional insights. In particular, 
we asked whether molecular subtypes defined from these bulk data reflect differences in 
malignant programs, malignant cell composition, and/or TME composition.
We first determined the TCGA expression subtypes of our ten HNSCC tumors. We scored 
malignant cells from each tumor for their correspondence to subtype expression signatures. 
Strikingly, each tumor clearly mapped to just one of three subtypes: basal (n=7), classical 
(n=2), or atypical (n=1) (Figure 6A). None of the malignant cells mapped to the 
mesenchymal subtype, even though it is the second most frequent subtype among oral cavity 
tumors. However, when we expanded our analysis to include stromal and immune cells, we 
found that hundreds of CAFs, myofibroblasts, and myocytes mapped to the mesenchymal

 subtype (Figure 6B). This finding raised the possibility that the mesenchymal TCGA 
subtype reflects high stromal representation in bulk samples, rather than a distinct malignant 
cell program. Indeed, analysis of TCGA samples confirmed that mesenchymal subtype 
tumors highly expressed genes specific to CAFs and myocytes (Figure 6C). Furthermore, 
when we examined histology sections for HNSCC tumors from TCGA, we confirmed that 
mesenchymal tumors had roughly 2.7-fold more fibroblasts than basal tumors (t-test, 
p<0.0001; Figures S7A–D).
To investigate the influence of TME composition on TCGA classifications further, we 
devised a computational approach to subtract the effect of non-malignant cells from TCGA 
profiles. We restricted the analysis to genes expressed by malignant cells. Since most of 
these genes were also expressed by non-malignant cells, we normalized their expression to 
remove the expected contribution of non-malignant cells. To this end, we used cell type-
specific gene signatures to estimate the relative abundance of each cell type in each tumor 
and then, for each gene, we inferred a linear relationship between its bulk expression across 
tumors and the relative abundance of each cell type using multiple linear regression (Figure 
6E). By using the residual of this regression model, we removed the influence of cell type 
frequencies, including malignant cell frequency (i.e. purity), and inferred a malignant cell-
specific intrinsic expression profile for each TCGA tumor.
Remarkably, while standard analysis of TCGA data recovered all four subtypes (Figure 6D), 
analysis of inferred malignant cell-specific expression eliminated the mesenchymal subtype, 
while maintaining the other three subtypes (Figure 6F). Tumors previously classified as 
mesenchymal were found to be part of the previously described basal subtype (now referred 
to as ‘malignant-basal’). We validated that TCGA mesenchymal scores reflect genes 
primarily expressed by CAFs and do not correlate with the malignant cell-specific p-EMT 
program (Figure S4B–D). We therefore suggest that HNSCC tumors may be refined into 
three subtypes of malignant cells (malignant-basal, classical and atypical), with the 
previously described mesenchymal subtype reflecting malignant-basal tumors with a large 
stromal component. The combined malignant-basal subtype would be particularly prevalent, 
comprising >70% of oral cavity tumors in TCGA, consistent with the classification of seven 
out of ten tumors in our cohort.
p-EMT predicts metastasis and adverse pathological features
Incorporation of TCGA data gave us an opportunity to examine the prevalence and 
significance of the p-EMT program across a larger cohort. In our smaller cohort, the p-EMT 
program was evident in cells from seven of ten tumors (Figure S3B), which exactly 
correspond to the seven tumors that mapped to the malignant-basal subtype (Figure 6A). 
Consistent with our smaller cohort, p-EMT levels were highest in malignant-basal tumors in 
TCGA (Figure S7E). Furthermore, principal component analysis of malignant-basal TCGA 
tumors, but not atypical and classical tumors, revealed that the first two components were 
associated with expression of p-EMT genes and were inversely correlated with epithelial 
differentiation genes (Figures 7A, 7B, S7F and S7G). Remarkably, p-EMT programs defined 
from these unbiased analyses of bulk expression data were highly consistent with those 
defined by our scRNA-seq analyses (Figure 7A). They independently confirmed the absence

 of classical EMT TFs, except for SNAIL2 (Figure S7L), and further support an in vivo p-
EMT state in human tumors. Thus, by controlling for confounding effects of TME 
composition, we demonstrate that differences in p-EMT program expression represents a 
predominant source of inter-tumoral variability in HNSCC tumors.
Lymphatogenous spread of HNSCC tumors to form LN metastases is a major source of 
disease burden and mortality. Accordingly, resection of oral cavity tumors is typically 
accompanied by neck dissection to remove the first echelon of draining LNs, a procedure 
associated with patient morbidity. Tumors with poor prognostic features, such as 
extracapsular extension or lymphovascular invasion, also receive adjuvant therapy. We 
therefore tested whether the in vivo p-EMT signature might predict unfavorable pathological 
features or disease outcome in malignant-basal tumors.
We found that high p-EMT scores were associated with the existence and number of LN 
metastases and with higher nodal stage (hypergeometric test; p<0.05; Figure 7C). We also 
found an association with higher tumor grade, offering an explanation for the aggressiveness 
of poorly differentiated tumors. High p-EMT scores were similarly associated with adverse 
pathological characteristics, including extracapsular extension and lymphovascular invasion 
(Figure 7C), for which reliable biomarkers are lacking. Interestingly, p-EMT was not 
associated with primary tumor size (Figure 7C), suggesting a direct association with 
invasion and metastasis but not with tumor growth. Overall, p-EMT genes were among the 
top correlated genes with these clinical features, while other programs such as cell cycle or 
hypoxia did not correlate nearly as strongly (Figures 7D and S7H). In contrast, the epithelial 
differentiation program was negatively associated with metastasis (Figure S7H), consistent 
with our prior observation of an inverse correlation between p-EMT and epithelial 
differentiation. Importantly, the p-EMT program is a stronger predictor of nodal metastasis 
and local invasion (Figure S7I) than either the TCGA mesenchymal program or conventional 
EMT signatures, both of which primarily reflect CAF frequency (Figures S4A and S7I) 
(Cancer Genome Atlas, 2015; Tan et al., 2014). Current clinical practice relies on imperfect 
predictors of nodal metastasis, such as tumor thickness and size, resulting in a high rate 
(~80%) of unnecessary neck dissections (Monroe and Gross, 2012). The p-EMT score could 
help predict nodal metastasis and thus spare patient morbidity associated with unnecessary 
neck dissections (Figure S7J).
DISCUSSION
Intra-tumoral heterogeneity represents a major challenge in oncology. Among emerging 
technologies, scRNA-seq has facilitated the identification of developmental hierarchies, drug 
resistance programs, and patterns of immune infiltration relevant to tumor biology, 
diagnosis, and therapy (Kim et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017; Patel et al., 2014; Tirosh et al., 
2016a; Tirosh et al., 2016b; Venteicher et al., 2017). Here, we applied the approach to 
characterize primary HNSCC tumors and matched LN metastases. Our analysis highlights a 
complex cellular ecosystem with active cross-talk between malignant and non-malignant 
cells, and an in vivo p-EMT program associated with metastasis (Figure 7E). Our study 
represents an important step towards understanding intra-tumoral expression heterogeneity 
in epithelial tumors, which encompass most solid malignancies.

 Among our key findings is the identification of a p-EMT program in malignant cells in vivo. 
This program involves upregulation of certain mesenchymal genes and moderation of 
epithelial programs. Although reminiscent of an EMT-like process, the program lacks 
classical TFs thought to drive EMT, with exception of SNAIL2 (Nieto et al., 2016; Thiery et 
al., 2009; Ye and Weinberg, 2015). SNAIL2 levels do not correlate with the p-EMT program 
across individual cells in a tumor, but do correlate with the p-EMT program across tumors, 
both in our small cohort and in TCGA tumors (Figures S7K and S7L), hinting at post-
transcriptional regulation. Prior studies have linked SNAIL2 to EMT-like changes required 
for wound healing (Savagner et al., 2005), raising the possibility that such physiologic 
responses are co-opted by invasive tumor cells.
Given the absence of classical regulatory programs, the retention of epithelial markers, and 
the likely transience of this expression state, we speculate that the p-EMT program reflects a 
‘metastable’ state that recapitulates certain aspects of EMT, but may be fundamentally 
different from those defined in vitro (Lundgren et al., 2009; Nieto et al., 2016). Indeed, 
although we describe an isolated EMT-like program, the molecular description of EMT is 
currently being re-evaluated with increasing evidence for a continuum of states. It has also 
been hypothesized that a dynamic, partial EMT state confers invasive properties without 
losing tumor initiation capacity (Lambert et al., 2017). It remains unclear whether a full 
EMT state exists in HNSCC, or if the spectrum extends only to p-EMT. Regardless, our 
unbiased definition of an in vivo partial EMT-like program in patients should guide future 
studies of this process as it relates to human cancers and metastases.
Several observations suggest that the p-EMT program may promote local invasion and LN 
metastasis. First, IHC analyses clearly showed that the program localizes to the leading edge 
of primary tumors, potentially enabling the collective migration of cohorts of cells (Figure 
7E) (Clark and Vignjevic, 2015; Lambert et al., 2017). Interestingly, p-EMT cells are in 
close proximity to CAFs in the surrounding TME, consistent with ligand-receptor analyses 
supporting regulatory cross-talk between these populations. Second, p-EMThigh HNSCC 
cells have increased invasive potential in vitro. Third, deconvolution of bulk expression 
profiles for hundreds of HNSCC tumors identified the p-EMT program as a leading source 
of variability between patients that is strongly predictive of nodal metastases, 
lymphovascular invasion, and extranodal extension. Importantly, although CAF abundance 
did not independently predict nodal metastasis and invasion, tumors with both high CAF 
scores and high p-EMT scores had a particularly high propensity for metastasis, consistent 
with a cooperative effect (Figure S7I). This may reflect a role for paracrine signaling 
between CAFs and malignant cells in promoting nodal disease.
At the same time, other observations temper our conclusions. First, an important caveat of 
our study is that only 10 tumors were deeply characterized. Analysis of more tumors may 
reveal additional stromal, immune and malignant cell states, potentially including malignant 
cells that have further progressed towards a mesenchymal state. Second, the p-EMT program 
is largely absent from classical and atypical HNSCC tumors, which nonetheless metastasize 
at similar rates. Thus, p-EMT may be relevant in some subtypes but not others, potentially 
explaining discord regarding the importance of EMT in tumor biology (Nieto et al., 2016; 
Thiery et al., 2009; Ye and Weinberg, 2015). Third, although our data imply that the p-EMT

 state is responsive to CAF signals, the program might simply be a function of increased 
TME interactions due to disrupted tumor borders, and thus a correlate but not a cause of 
metastasis. Further study is needed to define the precise mechanisms by which p-EMT and 
corresponding stromal interactions drive HNSCC metastasis.
Subtype classification schemes have been applied to several tumor types based on ‘bulk’ 
analyses, which cannot effectively parse intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Here, knowledge of the 
expression states of malignant, stromal, and immune cell types in HNSCC tumors enabled 
us to deconvolve bulk TCGA data and infer malignant cell-specific expression profiles. This 
analysis suggested that the mesenchymal subtype reflects the TME, namely the fraction of 
CAFs and myocytes within a tumor. Indeed, no malignant cells mapped to the mesenchymal 
subtype described by TCGA. Thus, the mesenchymal subtype may reflect stromal 
composition and should be re-evaluated in future studies. In contrast, we find strong support 
for the other three HNSCC subtypes (classical, atypical, basal). Malignant cells from each of 
our tumors map exclusively to one of those subtypes. These subtypes also remain stable 
when controlling for TME. Nonetheless, the potential of stromal components to offer 
orthogonal prognostic insight (Figure S7I) suggests that future classification systems may 
ultimately need to integrate both malignant and non-malignant components in a tumor.
In summary, our work provides important insights into HNSCC biology and an atlas of 
malignant, stromal, and immune cells that should prove relevant to other epithelial 
malignancies. Our computational approach for inferring malignant cell-specific profiles 
from bulk expression data refined HNSCC subtypes, and offers a general strategy to extract 
information from many other cancer datasets. Finally, our definition of a p-EMT program 
helps relate a large body of EMT data to the in vivo biology of a human tumor. Although 
further studies are needed, the association of this p-EMT program to unfavorable clinical 
features may guide future diagnostic strategies and treatment algorithms.

 56/M; MEEI24 78/F; MEEI25 76/F; MEEI26 51/M; MEEI28 58/M. Fresh biopsies of oral 
cavity head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) were collected at the time of 
surgical resection, either from the primary tumor or lymph node (LN) dissection. A small 
fragment was snap frozen for bulk whole exome sequencing and the remainder of the 
provided tissue was processed for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq).
Cell Lines—Oral cavity HNSCC cell lines (Cal-27, SCC9, SCC4, SCC25, and JHU-006; 
all derived from male patients) were generously provided by Dr. James Rocco and 
colleagues after confirmation by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis (data not shown). They 
were cultured as follows: JHU-006 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media (ThermoFisher 
Scientific), while others cells were grown in 3:1 Ham’s F12 (ThermoFisher 
Scientific):DMEM (ThermoFisher Scientific). 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Peak Serum, 
Fort Collins, CO) and 1X penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (PSG; ThermoFisher Scientific) 
were added to all growth media.
METHOD DETAILS
Tumor Dissociation—Fresh biopsy samples of oral cavity HNSCC were minced, washed 
with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and 
dissociated using a Human Tumor Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, 
Germany) per manufacturer guidelines. Viability was confirmed to be >90% in all samples 
using trypan blue (ThermoFisher Scientific) exclusion. Cell suspensions were filtered using 
a 70 μm filter (ThermoFisher Scientific), and dissociated cells were pelleted and re-
suspended in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). 
Cells were stained with CD45-vioblue (Miltenyi Biotec), along with either the combination 
of CD90-PE (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and CD31-PE-cy7 (BD Biosciences) or 
CD3-PE-cy7 (ThermoFisher Scientific), then washed with cold PBS, and re-suspended for 
flow cytometry analyses.
Sorting of Patient Samples—Cells were stained for viability with 1 μM calcein AM 
(ThermoFisher Scientific) and 0.33 μM TO-PRO-3 iodide (ThermoFisher Scientific) 
immediately prior to sorting. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed on 
FACSAria Fusion Special Order System (BD Biosciences) using 488 nm (calcein AM, 
530/30 filter), 640 nm (TO-PRO-3, 670/14 filter), 405 nm (Vioblue, 450/50 filter), 561 nm 
(PE, 586/15 filter; PE-Cy7, 780/60 filter) lasers. Standard forward scatter height versus area 
criteria were used to discard doublets and capture singlets. Viable cells were identified as 
calceinhigh and TO-PROlow and additional gates were used to enrich or deplete specific cell 
types in each plate. For each tumor, plates were sorted containing CD45-cells (to deplete 
immune cells), CD45-/CD90-/CD31-cells (to further deplete fibroblasts and endothelium 
and enrich for malignant cells), CD45+ cells (to enrich for immune cells), and CD45+/CD3+ 
cells (to enrich specifically for T-cells). Single cells were sorted into 96-well plates 
containing TCL buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Plates were 
briefly centrifuged, snap frozen, and stored at −80 °C before cDNA synthesis and library 
construction. For each tumor sample, at least one CD45- and one CD45+ plate was 
sequenced.

 cDNA Synthesis and Library Construction—Libraries for isolated single cells were 
generated based on the SMART-Seq2 protocol (Picelli et al., 2014) with the following 
modifications: RNA was purified using Agencourt RNAClean XP beads (Beckman Coulter, 
Brea, CA), prior to reverse transcription with Superscript II (ThermoFisher Scientific) or 
Maxima (ThermoFisher Scientific) reverse transcriptase and whole transcriptome 
amplification using KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). 
Full length cDNA libraries were tagmented using the Nextera XT Library Prep Kit 
(Illumina, San Diego, CA). 384 samples were pooled and sequenced as paired-end 38 base 
reads on a NextSeq 500 instrument (Illumina).
Whole Exome and Targeted Sequencing—Snap frozen fresh biopsy and matched 
whole blood samples were processed by the Genomics Platform at the Broad Institute. 
Whole exome sequencing was performed per standard protocols using Illumina technology 
(Illumina). Briefly, library construction was performed as previously described (Fisher et al., 
2011). Subsequently, hybridization and capture were performed using the Rapid Capture 
Exome Kit (Illumina) per manufacturer protocol. After post-capture enrichment, library 
pools were quantified using an automated qPCR assay on the Agilent Bravo (Agilent 
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Cluster amplification of denatured templates was performed 
per manufacturer’s protocol using HiSeq 4000 cluster chemistry and HiSeq 4000 flowcells 
(Illumina). Flowcells were sequenced using v1 Sequencing-by-Synthesis chemistry for 
HiSeq 4000 flowcells. The flowcells were then analyzed using RTA v.1.18.64 or later 
(Illumina). In addition, SnAPShot next generation sequencing v2 assay was performed on 
FFPE samples at the MGH Center for Integrated Diagnostics per standard protocols as 
previously described (Zheng et al., 2014). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina 
NextSeq (Illumina). Novoalign (Novocraft Technologies, Selangor, Malaysia) was used to 
align reads to the hg19 human genome reference. Single nucleotide and indel variants were 
detected using MuTect1 (Cibulskis et al., 2013), LoFreq (Wilm et al., 2012), and GATK 
(DePristo et al., 2011; McKenna et al., 2010; Van der Auwera et al., 2013). Exons from 91 
gene targets were sequenced.
RNA-seq of Cell Lines—For scRNA-seq, cells were harvested, stained for viability, and 
sorted into 96-well plates, as described above. cDNA synthesis, library construction, and 
sequencing were also performed as described. For bulk RNA, RNA was isolated from 1,000 
pooled cells using RNEasy Micro Kit (Qiagen).
Flow Cytometry and Sorting of Cell Lines—Sorting of SCC9 cells was performed 
using TGFBI antibody (LifeSpan Biosciences, Seattle, WA) conjugated to PE using the R-
PE IgG labeling kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) per manufacturer specifications. Cells were 
sorted as described above. For stained samples, cells were considered marker-positive if 
marker signal was at least as high as the top ~2% of cells in the unstained control. For 
repopulation experiments, 105 TGFBIhigh, TGFBIlow, and bulk sorted cells were plated and 
propagated. Cells were harvested after 4 hours, 24 hours, 4 days, and 7 days, stained with 
TGFBI-PE as described, and re-analyzed by FACS. Cells harvested at 4 hours were not re-
stained prior to FACS analysis. Final analysis was performed in FlowJo version 10.2

 (TreeStar, Ashland, OR). In addition, single cells in each condition at the 7 day time point 
were sorted into 96-well plates for scRNA-seq.
Modification of Culture Conditions—For hypoxia cultures, SCC9 cells were grown for 
seven days in a Galaxy 48R CO2 incubator (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), with 2% O2, 
5% CO2. Cells were then harvested and FACS sorted for scRNA-seq. For co-culture 
experiments, a tumor biopsy from MEEI18 was used to derive CAFs by the Broad Institute 
Cancer Cell Line Factory. Briefly, the tissue was washed with PBS (ThermoFisher 
Scientific) and minced using a scalpel. It was digested in 5 mL media with 1 mL 10X 
collagenase-hyaluronidase (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) and 1 mL dispase 
(StemCell Technologies) for one hour at 37°C. Cells were then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 
5 minutes, followed by RBC lysis with a 5 minute incubation in ACK lysis buffer 
(ThermoFisher Scientific), followed by 3 minutes in 1 mL media with 1:6 DNase I 
(StemCell Technologies). Cells were then washed and plated for propagation in ACL4 media 
(RPMI with L-glutamine (ThermoFisher Scientific) with 5% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5% 
BSA (Rockland Immunochemicals, Limerick, PA), 10 mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5

transferrin (Sigma-Aldrich), 25 nM sodium selenite (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 nM hydrocortisone 
(Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich)). Growth of a pure 
population of fibroblasts was confirmed by a PCR-based targeted sequencing assay using the 
TruSeq Custom Amplicon platform (Illumina). These tumor-derived fibroblasts were 
initially plated at a 1:3 ratio with SCC9 cells, and cells were harvested after 48 hours when 
the ratio of tumor-derived fibroblasts to SCC9 cells was approximately 1:1.
TGFβ Treatment and TGFBI Overexpression—For drug treatment experiments, 
SCC9 cells were grown in vehicle (4μM HCl with 1μg/mL BSA), TGFβ, or TGFβ-inhibitor. 
For TGFβ-treated cells, 10 ng/mL recombinant TGFβ1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) 
or TGFβ3 (R&D systems) was applied. Cells in the TGFβ-inhibitor condition were either 
grown in 3:1 F12:DMEM (ThermoFisher Scientific) with 1μM A-83-01 (Tocris Bioscience, 
Bristol, UK) or small airway basal medium (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) with four inhibitors 
of the TGFβ pathway: 1 μM DMH-1, 1 μM A-83-01, 1 μM CHIR99021 (Tocris Bioscience), 
and 10 μM Y-27632 (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX). For scRNA-seq, cells in each 
condition were harvested 4 hours after treatment. For bulk RNA-seq, cells were harvested 2, 
4, or 6 days after treatment and titrated for analysis. For matrigel invasion assay and cell 
proliferation assays, cells were maintained in the given conditions for the duration of the 
experiment.
For TGFBI overexpression, TGFBI was PCR-amplified from pDNR-Dual-TGFBI (Harvard 
Plasmid Consortium, Cambridge, MA) using the following primers (Integrated DNA 
Technologies, Coralville, IA): For: 5′-CAC CAT GGC GCT CTT CGT GCG G-3′ and Rev: 
5′-CTA ATG CTT CAT CCT CTC-3′. The PCR product was then cloned into pMAL (van 
Galen et al., 2014) using the pENTR/D-TOPO Cloning Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and 
the Gateway LR Clonase protocol (ThermoFisher Scientific). SCC9 cells at 50–70% 
confluence were transfected with pMAL-TGFBI or pMAL-Luc (van Galen et al., 2014) 
using the FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) per manufacturer

 protocol. Transfection with pMAX-GFP (van Galen et al., 2014) in parallel conditions 
confirmed adequate transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 24 hours after transfection.
TGFBI Knockout Using CRISPR-Cas9—CRISPR sgRNAs were subcloned into 
lentiCRISPRv2 (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) using primers listed in the Key Resources 
Table. The target sequences were: sgRNA1 (exon 1 CDS, antisense): 5′-AGC TGG TAG 
GGC GAC TTG GC-3′; sgRNA2 (exon 1 CDS, antisense): 5′-CGA CTT GGC GGG ACC 
CGC CA-3′; and sgRNA3 (exon 8 CDS, sense): 5′-CAT GCT CAC TAT CAA CGG GA-3′. 
A non-targeting control (“mock”) plasmid (BRDN0001478216, Broad Genetic Perturbation 
Platform, Broad Institute, Cambridge MA) was used for comparison. CRISPR plasmids 
were co-transfected into 293T cells with GAG/POL and VSVG plasmids, per the Addgene 
third generation lentiviral system, using the FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Promega) per 
manufacturer’s protocol. At 36 hours post-transfection, the supernatant was collected and 
concentrated using Lenti-X Concentrator (Clontech), per manufacturer’s protocol. SCC9 
cells at 70% confluence (approximately 2.5 × 104 cells) in 24-well plates were infected with 
concentrated virus for 36 hours, allowed to recover for multiple passages, and selected with 
1 μg/mL puromycin (Life Technologies) for 48 hours, prior to harvesting for matrigel and 
sequencing assays. Genomic DNA was isolated from 3 × 106 cells using QIAamp DNA 
Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen). A ~200 bp fragment surrounding the CRISPR cut site of each 
sample was PCR amplified (PCR Supermix, ThermoFisher Scientific) using TGFBI NGS 
primers listed in the Key Resources Table. Efficient genome editing was confirmed with next 
generation sequencing of PCR products at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) 
Center for Computational & Integrative Biology (CCIB) DNA Core per standard core 
protocols. Briefly, this entailed Illumina adapter ligation, low-cycle PCR amplification, and 
sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina). Results were analyzed using the CRISPResso 
software pipeline (Pinello et al., 2016).
Matrigel Invasion Assay—Matrigel invasion assay was performed as previously 
described (Puram et al., 2012). Preformed matrigel invasion chambers (Corning, Corning, 
NY) were prepared per manufacturer protocol. Serum-containing media was placed below 
the invasion chambers and 2.5 × 104 cells suspended in 500 μL serum-free media were 
placed above the invasion chambers and incubated for 24 hours. Cells on the lower surface 
of the membrane were fixed with methanol, stained with crystal violet, and counted in a 
blinded manner. Cells in serum-containing media were used as a negative control.
Cell Proliferation Assay—CellTiter-Glo (CTG) proliferation assay were performed per 
manufacturer protocol. Cells were plated in 96-well plates in 6–9 replicates per condition at 
1,000 cells per well. Cells were lysed on days 2, 4, and 6 by adding CTG reagent (Promega), 
and point luminescence was measured via the BioTek Synergy HTX Platereader (BioTek, 
Winooski, VT). For all experiments, a proportional sampling of cells were also lysed at 1 
hour after initial plating to ensure that equal numbers were plated across conditions. For 
cells lysed on day 6, fresh media was added on day 3. CTG luminescence values for 
individual wells were normalized by subtracting background luminescence (mean 
luminescence values for wells containing PBS, with CTG reagent added), adjusting for 2μM

 adenosine triphosphate (ATP) luminescence measured on the same 96-well plate, and 
normalizing by numbers of plated cells in each condition (as measured by T0 luminescence).
Staining of Tissue Sections—Sectioning and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of 
formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) HNSCC specimens was performed by the MGH 
Histopathology Core per standard protocols. All sections were 5 μm thick. Briefly, antigen 
retrieval was performed in a decloaker (Biocare Medical) using citrate buffer at pH 6.0. 
Sections were deparaffinized through xylenes and graded ethanol. Primary antibodies were 
visualized with HRP- or AP-linked secondary antibodies, followed by diaminobenzidine 
(DAB; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) or AP-red (Dako) chromogens, respectively. Sections 
were counterstained with hematoxylin (ThermoFisher Scientific). Human papillomavirus 
(HPV) in situ hybridization (ISH) was performed per Advanced Cell Diagnostics RNAscope 
DAB ISH protocol (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA), with dewaxing followed by a 
95-minute target retrieval step, incubation with the RNAscope enzyme, and a 6-hour 
hybridization. Stained sections were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope with a 
Nikon DS-Fi1 high definition color camera and NIS-Elements Advanced Research version 
3.10 software (Nikon, Melville, NY). Images were captured with a 20X objective and were 
reviewed by a dedicated head and neck pathologist (W.C.F.).
TCGA Stromal Quantification—Digital hematoxylin and eosin stained slides for TCGA 
tumors were downloaded and entire sections were examined in a blinded manner. Working 
with a dedicated head and neck pathologist (W.C.F.), the stromal content of each basal and 
mesenchymal tumor was quantified by percent and scored as 0 (<10% stromal content), 
1+ (10% to <20%), 2+ (20% to <30%), 3+ (30% to <50%), or 4+ (≥50%).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism version 7. (GraphPad Software, La 
Jolla, CA) or MatLab version 2014b (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Parameters such as sample 
size, the number of replicates, the number of independent experiments, measures of center, 
dispersion, and precision (mean ± SD or SEM), and statistical significance are reported in 
Figures and Figure Legends. Results were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05, 
or a lower threshold when indicated, by the appropriate test (ANOVA, t-test, Pearson 
correlation). The Student’s t-test, permutation test, and hypergeometric test were utilized for 
comparisons in experiments with two sample groups. In experiments with more than two 
sample groups, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed followed by Bonferroni’s 
post-hoc test.
Single-Cell RNA-seq Data Processing—Expression levels were quantified as 
Ei,j=log2(TPMi,j/10+1), where TPMi,j refers to transcript-per-million for gene i in sample j, 
as calculated by RSEM (Li and Dewey, 2011). TPM values are then divided by 10 since we 
estimate the complexity of single-cell libraries to be on the order of 100,000 transcripts and 
would like to avoid counting each transcript ~10 times, as would be the case with TPM, 
which may inflate the difference between the expression level of a gene in cells in which the 
gene is detected and those in which it is not detected. This modification has a minimal 
influence on the expression values (Spearman correlation of 1, Pearson correlation of 0.98),

 but decreases the difference between the expression values of undetected genes (i.e. zero) 
and that of detected genes (data not shown), thereby reducing the impact of dropouts on 
downstream analysis. We note that the SMART-Seq2 protocol cannot incorporate unique 
molecular identifiers (UMI) and therefore we cannot directly identify duplicate reads.
For each cell, we quantified two quality measures: (i) the number of genes for which at least 
one read was mapped, which is indicative of library complexity and (ii) the average 
expression level (E) of a curated list of housekeeping genes (Tirosh et al., 2016a), which is 
meant to verify that genes which are expected to be expressed highly, regardless of cell type, 
are indeed detected as highly expressed. Scatter plot analyses of all profiled cells separated 
low and high quality cells based on the these two measures (data not shown), and we 
therefore conservatively excluded all cells with either fewer than 2,000 detected genes or an 
average housekeeping expression level (E) below 2.5, as done in previous studies (Patel et 
al., 2014; Tirosh et al., 2016a). For cells passing these quality controls, the median number 
of reads were 1.34 million per cell, with a 52.2% transcriptome mapping rate and 3,880 
detected genes.
We used the remaining cells (k=5,902) to identify genes that are expressed at high or 
intermediate levels by calculating the aggregate expression of each gene i across the k cells, 
as Ea(i)=log2(average(TPM(i)1...k)+1), and excluded genes with Ea<4. For the remaining 
cells and genes, we defined relative expression by centering the expression levels, Eri,j=Ei,j-
average[Ei,1...k]. The relative expression levels, across the remaining subset of cells and 
genes, were used for downstream analysis. Although normalization approaches can 
potentially introduce bias into initial clustering, relative expression levels, as defined above 
and as defined with an alternative normalization method (Bacher et al., 2017) were highly 
similar. The use of alternative normalization had a limited influence on downstream results 
such as the distribution of p-EMT scores (data not shown).
To test for batch effects, we performed preliminary clustering of all cells using t-SNE with 
perplexity of 30 followed by density clustering (DBscan with parameters epsilon=5 and 
MinPoints=15). The resulting clusters showed limited impact of sequencing batches but an 
apparent batch effect linked to the enzyme used for reverse transcription (Superscript II or 
Maxima; data not shown). Since these batch effects have a different impact on the 
transcriptomes of distinct cell types, we corrected the effect in two steps. First, of the 27 
clusters identified in our preliminary clustering described below (see Classification to 
Malignant and Non-malignant Cells and Figure S1D), we identified seven pairs of clusters 
that differed by the enzyme used but otherwise were highly similar (as defined by an average 
Pearson correlation above 0.9); each of these pairs of clusters were then merged, thereby 
reducing the impact of enzyme usage on cluster assignment. We then normalized the data 
within each cluster to correct for within-cluster differences that may be linked to enzyme 
usage. In each cluster, we calculated, for each gene, the average expression among cells 
processed with Superscript II, the average expression among cells processed with Maxima, 
and the difference between those. We then subtracted the difference from all cells processed 
with Maxima in order to correct for the average differences between the two subsets of cells, 
and make all data comparable to that generated by Superscript II.

 Annotation of t-SNE clusters (as in Figures 2A and 2C) by the reverse transcription enzyme 
revealed that all non-malignant clusters and most malignant clusters contained cells 
processed with both enzymes (data not shown), suggesting that the choice of enzymes has a 
minimal effect on the final clustering pattern. Five malignant clusters (each corresponding to 
all malignant cells from a specific tumor) included cells processed only with Superscript II 
or only with Maxima. Four of these clusters included only cells processed by Superscript II; 
since the normalization was done to make all data comparable to Superscript II (by only 
correcting the Maxima-generated data) these clusters should remain comparable to all other 
clusters. One malignant cluster contained only cells processed by Maxima, corresponding to 
all malignant cells of MEEI28, which could theoretically introduce variability between 
MEEI28 and other malignant clusters; however, this tumor had few differentially expressed 
genes compared to other tumors (Figure 2D), indicating that batch effects are unlikely to 
explain the differences between tumors. Importantly, variability of the p-EMT and epithelial 
differentiation programs was not influenced by the enzyme used for reverse transcription 
(data not shown).
Epithelial Classification—We defined a set of potential epithelial markers consisting of 
all cytokeratins, EPCAM, and SFN. We excluded potential markers that were lowly 
expressed (Ea<4) or not co-regulated with the other markers across all single cells (Pearson 
R<0.4 with the average of all other markers). The average expression (E) of the 14 
remaining genes was used to quantify an epithelial score, which was bimodally distributed 
(Figure 1C). Epithelial and non-epithelial cells were defined as those with epithelial scores 
above 3 and below 1.5, respectively, and the remaining cells (with intermediate scores) were 
unresolved.
CNV Estimation—Initial CNVs (CNV0) were estimated by sorting the analyzed genes by 
their chromosomal location and applying a moving average to the relative expression values, 
with a sliding window of 100 genes within each chromosome, as previously described (Patel 
et al., 2014; Tirosh et al., 2016a). To avoid considerable impact of any particular gene on the 
moving average, we limited the relative expression values to [−3,3] by replacing all values 
above 3 by a ceiling of 3, and replacing values below −3 by a floor of −3. This was 
performed only in the context of CNV estimation. We scored each cell for the extent of CNV 
signal, defined as the mean of squares of CNV0 values across the genome, and for the 
correlation between the CNV0 profile of each cell with the average CNV0 profile of all cells 
from the corresponding tumor. Putative malignant cells were then defined as those with 
CNV signal above 0.05 and CNV correlation above 0.5, putative non-malignant cells as 
those below the two cutoffs, and unresolved cells as those above only one of the thresholds. 
This initial analysis was based on the average CNV0 of all cells as a reference, which is 
biased due to the inclusion of many malignant cells. We thus redefined CNV estimations, the 
CNV signal, and CNV correlations values using the average patterns of non-malignant cells 
as a reference. Non-malignant cells were separated into distinct clusters based on t-SNE as 
described below. For each cluster we defined a baseline reflecting the average CNV0 
estimates of all cells in that cluster, and based on these distinct baselines we defined the 
maximal (BaseMax) and minimal (BaseMin) baseline at each window. The final CNV 
estimate of cell i at position j was defined as:

 CNV f (i, j) =
CNV0(i, j) − BaseMax(j),

if CNV0(i, j) < BaseMin(j) − 0.2
0,
if BaseMin(j) − 0.2 < CNV0(i, j) < BaseMax(j) + 0.2
Classification to Malignant and Non-malignant Cells—Epithelial and CNV-based 
classifications were highly concordant and enabled robust assignment of single cells as 
malignant or non-malignant. To further support these classifications, we reasoned that global 
similarity of gene expression programs should also distinguish between malignant and non-
malignant cells. We examined 27 clusters as defined by the preliminary clustering described 
above. Most clusters contained exclusively malignant or non-malignant cells by the above 
two criteria. Five clusters of smaller sizes were associated primarily with cells that had 
unresolved or inconsistent assignments by the above two criteria. These clusters were also 
associated with low complexity (number of genes detected in each cell) and low expression 
of housekeeping genes, leading us to suspect that they reflect low-quality data. Exclusion of 
these 324 cells was therefore useful both in order to maintain confidence in malignant 
classifications and to remove cells of low quality for which the global expression profile and 
associated clustering may be highly affected by their low data quality.
Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes—To identify differentially 
expressed genes between different clusters, including comparisons of non-malignant clusters 
and of malignant clusters, we combined three criteria: (i) an average fold-change of 2, (ii) a 
t-test p-value below 10−10, and (iii) a permutation test p-value below 0.001. The latter 
criterion was defined by shuffling the assignments of cells to clusters 10,000 times and 
counting the fraction of times where an equal or larger difference was obtained between the 
average expression of each cluster and that of the remaining clusters. The cutoff in the 
second criterion ensures the control for multiple testing (a stringent Bonferroni correction 
would result in a corrected p-value of 6.5 × 10−6, as there are at most 10 × 6,465 tests in the 
family of hypotheses for differential expression).
Classifying Non-malignant Cells—t-SNE analysis of all non-malignant cells using 
perplexity of 30 was followed by DBscan clustering (with parameters 5 and 15) to identify 
eight major clusters. Clustering using this approach was highly consistent with an alternative 
approach (Figure S1E) (Bacher et al., 2017). Furthermore, additional t-SNE analyses with 
multiple perplexity parameters (15, 20, 25, 30 and 35) and six instances for each perplexity 
parameter confirmed the robustness of the clustering patterns (data not shown). For each 
original cluster, we quantified its robustness in each alternative t-SNE instance by the 
fraction of cells for which the five nearest neighbors (in the alternative t-SNE) are all 
assigned to the same cluster as the cells being examined. This analysis demonstrated an 
average rate (across the 30 alternative t-SNE analyses) of consistent clustering larger than 
99.6% for each of the clusters. Inspection of the top differentially expressed genes revealed 
classical cell type markers; for each cluster, we thus defined a set of marker genes, which 
were both identified as differentially expressed and previously associated with a specific cell

 type. The average expression profiles of those gene-sets were indeed highly specific to the 
corresponding clusters (Figure S1F), supporting the cell type classifications.
To further identify subtypes we focused on the two cell types with the largest numbers of 
cells: T-cells and fibroblasts. We used refined DBscan clustering of the t-SNE analysis (with 
parameters Epsilon=3, and MinPoints=5) to separate each of those clusters to sub-clusters, 
and further examined the results with multiple t-SNE analyses to evaluate the robustness of 
cluster assignments (data not shown).
The T-cell cluster was subdivided into four subtypes, which were annotated based on the 
differential expression of T cell markers (Figure S2A). This clustering was not strict as 
variability among T cells was continuous, yet the four clusters were used to represent the 
main patterns of variability that we observed among T cells (exhausted, CD4, CD8, Tregs).
For fibroblasts, we first observed two robust sub-clusters (myofibroblasts and CAFs, each 
with more than 98% consistent clustering as defined above) and a third intermediate sub-
cluster which was less robust (89% consistent clustering, data not shown). In subsequent 
analysis, we explored further the diversity of fibroblasts using a focused PCA (Figure S2D). 
This analysis was restricted to fibroblasts and to genes that are preferentially expressed by 
fibroblasts (defined as Ea of fibroblast higher than Ea of all other non-malignant cells 
combined). It recapitulated the three sub-clusters defined above, but also demonstrated that 
CAFs may be further separated into two subtypes (CAF1 and CAF2) that differ in the 
expression of many ligands, receptors, and other fibroblast-related genes (Figure S2E).
Expression Programs of Intra-tumoral Heterogeneity—For each of the 10 tumors, 
non-negative matrix factorization (as implemented by the Matlab nnmf function, with the 
number of factors set to 10) was used to identify variable expression programs. NNMF was 
applied to the relative expression values (Er), by transforming all negative values to zero. 
Notably, undetected genes include many drop-out events (genes that are expressed but are 
not detected in particular cells due to the incomplete transcriptome coverage), which 
introduce challenges for normalization of single-cell RNA-seq; since NNMF avoids the 
exact normalized values of undetected genes (as they are all zero), it may be beneficial in 
analysis of single-cell RNA-seq (data not shown). We retained only programs for which the 
standard deviation in cell scores within the respective tumor was larger than 0.8, which 
resulted in a total of 60 programs across the 10 tumors. The 60 programs were compared by 
hierarchical clustering (data not shown), using one minus the Pearson correlation coefficient 
over all gene scores as a distance metric. Six clusters of programs were identified manually 
(Figure 3B) and used to define meta-signatures. For each cluster, NNMF gene scores were 
log2-transformed and then averaged across the programs in the cluster, and genes were 
ranked by their average scores (see Table S6 for the top 50 genes in each cluster). The top 30 
genes for each cluster were defined as the meta-signature that was used to define cell scores 
(see Table S7); each of those genes had average scores above 1 and a t-test p-value below 
0.05, based on their scores across the individual programs in the cluster. Since the number of 
programs in a cluster was small this analysis was not powered to correct for multiple testing 
and thus we refer to an uncorrected p-value and selected the top ranked genes. However, 
while confidence is difficult to establish for individual genes in each meta-program, each

 gene-set defined as a meta-program is highly significant in its co-variation in tumors. For 
each of the meta-programs, and within each of the tumors included in those meta-programs 
(2–8 tumors for each meta-program), the average Pearson correlation between all pairs of 
genes included in the gene-set (calculated across single malignant cells from the respective 
tumor) was higher than that obtained for 10,000 control gene-sets, which were selected to 
reproduce the overall distribution of expression levels of the meta-program genes (see also 
Defining Cell and Sample Scores).
To show the robustness of the NNMF-derived programs with regards to the number of 
NNMF factors in our dataset, we repeated the NNMF analysis with the number of factors 
between 5 and 15 (data not shown). We then compared the resulting NNMF programs to the 
meta-programs defined in our original analysis, with a threshold of global Pearson 
correlation (across all genes) of 0.2. This threshold is highly significant as it was never 
observed among 10,000 permutation analyses, in which we permuted the centered 
expression data of each cell and repeated the analysis. Each of the six meta-programs was 
identified with each of the NNMF parameters.
Defining Cell and Sample Scores—We used cell scores in order to evaluate the degree 
to which individual cells express a certain pre-defined expression program. These are 
initially based on the average expression of the genes from the pre-defined program in the 
respective cell: Given an input set of genes (Gj), we define a score, SCj(i), for each cell i, as 
the average relative expression (Er) of the genes in Gj. However, such initial scores may be 
confounded by cell complexity, as cells with higher complexity have more genes detected 
(i.e. less zeros) and consequently would be expected to have higher cell scores for any gene-
set. To control for this effect we also add a control gene-set (Gjcont); we calculate a similar 
cell score with the control gene-set and subtract it from the initial cell scores: 
SCj(i)=average[Er(Gj,i)] – average[Er(Gjcont,i)]. The control gene-set is selected in a way 
that ensures similar properties (distribution of expression levels) to that of the input gene-set 
to properly control for the effect of complexity. First, all analyzed genes are binned into 25 
bins of equal size based on their aggregate expression levels (Ea). Next, for each gene in the 
given gene-set, we randomly select 100 genes from the same expression bin. In this way, the 
control gene-set has a comparable distribution of expression levels to that of the considered 
gene-set, and is 100-fold larger, such that its average expression is analogous to averaging 
over 100 randomly-selected gene-sets of the same size as the considered gene-set. A similar 
approach was used to define bulk sample scores from TCGA.
Flow Cytometry and Sorting of Cell Lines—We performed n=3 independent 
experiments for TGFBI staining. For stained samples, cells were considered marker-positive 
if marker signal was at least as high as the top ~2% of cells in the unstained control.
Matrigel Invasion Assay—We performed n=3 independent experiments per condition, 
and n=4–6 replicates per independent experiment. Invaded cells in each well were counted in 
a blinded manner across four distinct high powered fields and averaged. Error was calculated 
as SEM for a representative experiment.

 Cell Proliferation Assay—We performed n=3–4 independent experiments per condition, 
and n=6–9 replicates per independent experiment. CTG luminescence values for individual 
wells were normalized by subtracting background luminescence (mean luminescence values 
for wells containing PBS, with CTG reagent added), adjusting for 2μM adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) luminescence measured on the same 96-well plate, and normalizing by 
numbers of plated cells in each condition (as measured by T0 luminescence). Error was 
calculated as SEM for a representative experiment.
Putative Interactions Between Cell Types—We identified putative interactions 
between any pair of cell types based on expression of a receptor by one cell type and 
expression of an interacting ligand by the other cell type: whenever a ligand transcript is 
“expressed” by cell type A and the interacting receptor transcript is “expressed” by cell type 
B, we define it as a potential interaction between A and B. If the malignant cells express the 
receptor or the ligand, then the corresponding interaction was defined as incoming or 
outgoing, respectively. This analysis required two additional definitions. First, the set of 
potential receptor-ligand interactions were obtained from Ramilowski et al. (Nature 
Communications, 2015). Second, a ligand or receptor transcript was defined as “expressed” 
by a given cell type if its average expression in that cell type was above our threshold of 4 
(in values of log2(TPM+1)).
TCGA Subtype Analysis—Bulk RNA-seq data of HNSCC tumors (rnaseqv2-
RSEM_genes_normalized) was downloaded from the Broad Firehose website (https://
gdac.broadinstitute.org/), along with additional tumor and clinical annotations. Expression 
data was log2-transformed, filtered to include only the top 10,000 genes (based on average 
expression), centered for each gene, and compared between subtypes. We identified all 
genes preferentially expressed in each of the four subtypes (fold-change >2 and p<0.01 by t-
test, when comparing a given subtype to each of the other three subtypes) and scored single 
cells by the four subtype gene-sets (Figures 6A and 6B). To further examine the 
classification of TCGA samples, we first calculated the average Pearson correlation of each 
sample with all samples classified by TCGA into a given subtype; samples with an average 
correlation above 0.1 to one (and only one) subtype were retained for further analysis 
(Figures 6C–F), while samples with lower correlations for all four subtypes or higher 
correlation to more than one subtype were excluded.
Inferring Cancer-cell Specific Expression—We first excluded all genes that are not 
expressed by the malignant cells (i.e., are only expressed by the TME) based on the single-
cell data. We retained cells with Ea above 3 (as calculated only over the malignant cells). 
While this step reduces the influence of TME on bulk expression profiles, it is not sufficient 
to control for the effect of TME because most genes expressed by malignant cells are also 
expressed at comparable levels by additional cell types in the TME. We thus aimed to 
remove this influence using regression analysis. For each of the cell types (t) (both TME and 
malignant cells) we used the average expression of cell type-specific genes to estimate the 
relative abundance of the cell type (Frt) across all bulk tumors. These estimates were then 
used for a multiple linear regression seeking to approximate Ex(i,g), the (log-transformed 
and centered) expression level of gene g in bulk tumor i, by the sum of Frt(i), the estimated

 relative cell type frequencies of tumor i, multiplied by gene-specific and cell type-specific 
scaling factors Xt(g):
Ex(i, g) = ∑t ∈ Tg
(Frt(i) ∗ Xt(g)) + R(i, g)
Tg includes all the cell types for which the average expression of gene g is lower than that of 
the malignant cells by at most 2-fold; note that this definition includes also the malignant 
cell as a cell type, which enables the regression to account for purity. This regression defines 
the scaling factors Xt(g) that minimize the sum of squares of the residuals, R(i,g), which 
reflect the component of expression level that is not accounted by the expression of cell 
types Tg based on the assumption of linear relationship between cell type abundances and 
total expression level; we define the residuals as the inferred cancer-cell specific expression.
p-EMT Stratification of TCGA samples—Since p-EMT and epithelial differentiation 
scores were a prominent source of variability in malignant-basal tumors, but not in classical 
and atypical, we classified only those tumors into p-EMT high and p-EMT low. We defined 
sample scores (see Defining Cell and Sample Scores) for all malignant–basal tumors based 
on the inferred cancer-cell specific expression of the p-EMT and epithelial differentiation 
(Epi. Diff. 2) signatures; only the subset of genes from these signatures which were included 
in the inferred cancer-cell specific expression were used for these scores. We then ranked the 
tumors based on their p-EMT score minus the epithelial differentiation, and defined the 
highest 40% as p-EMT high and the lowest 40% as p-EMT low, while excluding the 
remaining 20% of tumors with intermediate scores.
Prognostic analysis of p-EMT and CAF scores—To evaluate the effect of p-EMT on 
seven clinical features (Figure 7C), we compared the fractions of patients with that feature 
between p-EMT high and p-EMT low tumors, and evaluated the significance of enrichments 
with a hypergeometric test. To further evaluate the effect of p-EMT while also taking CAF 
frequency (which is highly consistent with TCGA mesenchymal scores) into account, we 
used a binomial logistic regression model as implemented by MATLAB fitglm function, 
with binomial distribution and included interactions. These models fit a logistic regression of 
two effects (p-EMT scores and CAF frequency scores) and their interactions, in order to 
predict the clinical features, with a separate model for each feature. The p-values from these 
models are shown in the bottom panel of Figure S7I.

 Figure 2. Expression heterogeneity of malignant and non-malignant cells in the HNSCC 
ecosystem
(A) t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) plot of non-malignant cells from 10 
patients reveals consistent clusters of stromal and immune cells across tumors. Clusters are 
assigned to indicated cell types by differentially expressed genes (see also Figure S1F).
(B) (Left) Zoomed in t-SNE plot of T-cells with distinct naïve-like, regulatory, cytotoxic, 
and exhausted populations as identified by DBscan clustering. (Right) Zoomed in t-SNE plot 
of fibroblasts with myofibroblasts, non-activated resting fibroblasts, and activated CAFs, 
which can be seen to further divide into two sub-clusters. Differentially expressed genes are 
listed for key subsets.
(C) t-SNE plot of malignant cells from 10 patients (indicated by colors) reveals tumor-
specific clusters. Clustering patterns for malignant and non-malignant cells are not driven by 
transcriptome complexity (see Figure S2H).
(D) Heatmap shows genes (rows) that are differentially expressed across 10 individual 
primary tumors (columns). For five tumors, expression is also shown for matched LNs. Red: 
high expression; Blue: low expression. Selected genes are highlighted. Two classical subtype 
tumors (MEEI6 and MEEI20; see also Figure 6A) preferentially expressed genes associated 
with detoxification and drug metabolism (e.g. GPX2, GSTMs, CYPs, ABCC1).

 Figure 3. Unbiased clustering reveals a common program of partial EMT (p-EMT) in HNSCC 
tumors
(A) Heatmap shows differentially-expressed genes (rows) identified by non-negative matrix 
factorization (NNMF) clustered by their expression across single cells (columns) from a 
representative tumor (MEEI25). The gene clusters reveal intra-tumoral programs that are 
differentially expressed in MEEI25. The corresponding gene signatures are numbered and 
selected genes indicated (right).
(B) Heatmap depicts pairwise correlations of 60 intra-tumoral programs derived from 10 
tumors, as in (A). Clustering identifies seven coherent expression programs across tumors. 
Rows in the heatmap that correspond to programs derived from MEEI25 are indicated by 
arrows and numbered as in (A).
(C) Heatmap shows NNMF gene scores (rows) for common (top) and tumor-specific 
(bottom) genes within the p-EMT program by tumor (columns).
(D) Representative images of SCC9 HNSCC cells sorted by p-EMT marker TGFBI into p-
EMThigh and p-EMTlow populations and analyzed by matrigel invasion assay.
(E) Bar plot depicts relative invasiveness of p-EMThigh and p-EMTlow SCC9 cells sorted 
and analyzed as in (D) (representative experiment; error bars reflect SEM; ANOVA, 
p<0.005, n=3).
(F) Bar plot depicts relative proliferation of p-EMThigh and p-EMTlow SCC9 cells sorted as

SCC9 cells isolated based on TGFBI expression. (Right) Histogram (offset) reveals the 
distribution (x-axis) of TGFBI expression across cells from the respective isolates (p-
EMThigh, p-EMTlow, and unsorted; separated by dashed lines). After 7 days in culture, p-
EMThigh, p-EMTlow, and unsorted cells have similar distributions of p-EMT marker 
expression. Additional experiments with the p-EMT marker CXADR demonstrate similar 
findings (data not shown).
(H) Violin plot depicts p-EMT scores for unsorted, p-EMTlow, and p-EMThigh SCC9 cell 
sorted and cultured as in (G). Respective isolates largely recapitulate the initial distribution 
of p-EMT scores.

 Figure 4. p-EMT cells at the leading edge engage in cross-talk with CAFs
(A–C) IHC images of representative HNSCC tumors (MEEI5, MEEI16, MEEI17, MEEI25, 
MEEI28) stained for p-EMT markers (PDPN, LAMB3, LAMC2) and the malignant cell-
specific marker p63 (A and B) or the epithelial program marker SPRR1B (C). Scale bar = 
100 μM.
(D) Scatter plot shows the Pearson correlation between the p-EMT program and other 
expression programs underlying HNSCC intra-tumoral heterogeneity (Figure 3). Blue 
circles depict the correlations within individual tumors; black circles and error-bars represent 
the average and standard error, respectively, across the different tumors.
(E) Bar plot depicts numbers of putative receptor-ligand interactions between malignant 
HNSCC cells and indicated cell types. Interaction numbers were calculated based on 
expression of receptors and corresponding ligands in scRNA-seq data. Outgoing interactions 
refer to the sum of ligands from malignant cells that interact with receptors on the indicated 
cell type. Incoming interactions refer to the opposite. CAFs express a significantly greater 
number of ligands whose receptors are expressed by malignant cells (hypergeometric test, 
p<0.05).
(F) Heatmap depicts expression of ligands expressed by in vivo and in vitro CAFs. Relative 
expression is shown for all in vivo CAFs, MEEI18 in vivo CAFs, and in vitro CAFs derived 
from MEEI18.

 (G) Heatmap depicts relative expression of genes that were differentially regulated when 
SCC9 cells were treated with TGFβ3 or TGFβ pathway inhibitors. Panel includes all genes 
with significantly higher expression upon TGFβ3 treatment and lower expression upon 
TGFβ inhibition, relative to vehicle (t-test, p<0.05). Heat intensity reflects relative 
expression of indicated genes in bulk RNA-seq profiles for nine samples in each group, 
corresponding to distinct dosage or time points (see STAR Methods). Selected genes are 
labeled and overlap with the in vivo p-EMT program (bold).
(H) Violin plot depicts distributions of the p-EMT gene expression score across SCC9 cells 
treated as in (G) and profiled by scRNA-seq. p-EMT scores were increased with TGFβ3 
treatment and decreased upon TGFβ inhibition, relative to vehicle (t-test, p<10−16)
(I) Bar plot shows relative invasiveness of SCC9 cells treated as in (G) (representative 
experiment; error bars reflect SEM; ANOVA, p<0.0001, n=3). In vitro treatment of HNSCC 
cells with the CAF-related ligand TGFβ causes coherent induction of the p-EMT program 
and increases invasiveness, while TGFβ inhibition has the opposite effect.

 Figure 6. HNSCC subtypes revised by deconvolution of expression profiles from hundreds of 
tumors
(A) t-SNE plot of malignant cells from ten tumors (as in Figure 2). Each cluster of cells 
corresponds to a different tumor. Cells are colored according to the TCGA expression 
subtype that they match. Black indicates no match. Each tumor can be clearly assigned to 
one of three subtypes: basal, atypical, or classical.
(B) t-SNE plot of non-malignant cells (as in Figure 2) from ten tumors. Each cluster of cells 
corresponds to a different cell type. Cells are colored according to the TCGA expression 
subtype that they match. Black indicates no match. Fibroblasts and myocytes highly express 
signature genes of the mesenchymal subtype, which likely reflects tumor profiles with high 
stromal representation.
(C) For each TCGA subtype (columns), heatmap shows relative expression of gene 
signatures for non-malignant cell types (rows), which were used as estimates of cell type 
abundances. Tumors classified as mesenchymal highly expressed genes specific to CAFs 
and myocytes, while atypical tumors were enriched for T- and B-cells.
(D) Heatmap depicts pairwise correlations between TCGA expression profiles ordered by 
their subtype annotations. This analysis included all genes and recovered all four subtypes.
(E) Schematic of linear regression used to subtract the influence of non-malignant cell 
frequency from bulk TCGA expression profiles, and thereby infer malignant cell-specific 
expression profiles.

 (F) Heatmap depicts pairwise correlations between TCGA expression profiles ordered by 
their subtype annotations. This analysis was based on the inferred malignant cell-specific 
expression profiles in (E). Classical and atypical subtypes are maintained. However, basal 
and mesenchymal subtypes collapse to a single subtype, which we term ‘malignant-basal.’

 Figure 7. p-EMT predicts nodal metastasis and adverse pathologic features
(A) PC1 and PC2 gene scores based on PCA of inferred malignant cell-specific profiles 
from all malignant-basal TCGA tumors (n=225). p-EMT genes (red) and epithelial 
differentiation genes (green) underlie variance among malignant-basal tumors.
(B) PC1 and PC2 gene scores based on PCA of inferred malignant cell-specific profiles from 
all classical and atypical TCGA tumors (n=156). p-EMT (red) and epithelial differentiation 
(green) genes are weakly associated with variance in these tumors.
(C) Plot depicts percentage of p-EMT high and p-EMT low malignant-basal tumors 
associated with each clinical feature. Higher p-EMT scores were associated with positive 
LNs, advanced nodal stage, high grade, extracapsular extension (ECE), and lymphovascular 
invasion (LVI) (hypergeometric test, p<0.05). Advanced local disease (T3/T4) as determined 
by T-stage did not correlate with p-EMT score.
(D) Volcano plot depicts gene expression differences between malignant-basal TCGA 
tumors with multiple LNs versus those without positive LNs. p-EMT genes (red) have 
increased expression, while epithelial differentiation genes (green) have decreased 
expression in metastatic tumors.
(E) Model of the in vivo p-EMT program associated with invasion and metastasis in 
malignant-basal HNSCC tumors.
