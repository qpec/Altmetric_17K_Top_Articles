Summary
QUESTIONS UNDER STUDY: Alzheimer-type amyloid-
β (Aβ) pathology was reported in brains of individuals de-
veloping iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (iCJD) after
treatment with human cadaveric growth hormone, and in-
terpreted as evidence of human transmission of Aβ by
the treatment. Here we investigated the prevalence of Aβ
pathology in other instances of iCJD related to dura mater
grafts.
METHODS: By use of immunohistochemistry for Aβ, we
investigated seven brains of patients (age range 28–63)
who succumbed to iCJD after dural grafting, which had
been applied by means of neurosurgery between 11 and 25
years before death. For control, we examined a series of 21
brains of age-matched (40–63 years) patients with sporad-
ic CJD (sCJD) and an additional series of 81 sCJD cases
(55–85 years) with the same methods.
RESULTS: In five of seven iCJD brains, Aβ was deposited
in meningeal vessels as congophilic amyloid angiopathy
and brain parenchymal plaques. This was significantly (p
<0.001) more frequent than in the age-matched sCJD con-
trols and in the usual sCJD series.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that congophilic amyloid
angiopathy and brain parenchymal Aβ plaques are frequent
in iCJD after dural grafting. The presence of Aβ pathology
in young individuals is highly unusual and suggests a caus-
al relationship to the dural grafts. Further studies will be
needed to elucidate whether such pathology resulted from
the seeding of Aβ aggregates from the grafts to host tissues.

Introduction
Many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), Parkinsons’s disease (PD), polyglutamine
expansion diseases and prion diseases share fundamental
pathogenetic similarities. In each of these diseases, proteins
coalesce to form self-propagating oligomers that can re-
cruit further monomers and elongate to form higher-order
aggregates [1]. Such aggregates can then break, thereby
multiplying their numbers [2]. This phenomenon is thought
to represent the basis for the infectivity of prions [1, 3].
In prion diseases, the seeded propagation of the patholo-
gical, “scrapie” conformer of the prion protein PrPSc is de-
pendent on the presence of its cellular counterpart PrPC
[4]. During the pathogenesis of AD, Aβ displays behaviour
similar to that described above, raising the legitimate ques-
tion whether it may also behave as a prion and be infec-
tious. Indeed, thorough experiments with transgenic mice
overexpressing Aβ have repeatedly shown that Aβ aggreg-
ates (derived from mice or from humans) may be propag-
ated in a prion-like manner [5–8]. Similar observations
have been made for tau [9, 10], the other major protein in-
volved in AD. Likewise, it was found that injection of α-
synuclein aggregates in transgenic and even in wild-type
mice can provoke a spreading pathology similar to that ob-
served in human synucleinopathies [11–14]. However, epi-
demiological surveillance has thus far failed to detect any
correlation between iatrogenic manipulations, which may
conceivably introduce Aβ or α-synuclein seeds, and the de-
velopment of AD or PD.
Recently, Jaunmuktane et al. [15] reported Alzheimer-type
gray matter and vascular Aβ pathology in four of eight
brains of individuals with iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob dis-
ease (iCJD) after treatment with human growth hormone
(hGH) preparations from cadaveric pituitary glands. They
interpreted their data as evidence of human transmission
of Aβ by the treatment and suggested that healthy exposed
individuals may be at risk of iatrogenic Alzheimer’s dis-
ease. These findings have raised the question whether other
known iatrogenic routes of prion transmission may also be
relevant to Aβ and other proteopathic seeds [15]. Another
major transmission route known in iCJD has been the use
of dural grafts during neurosurgery in the 1980s and early
1990s that resulted in more than 220 iCJD cases, a number
similar to that caused by hGH treatment [3].

 To answer this question, we have retrospectively analysed
iCJD patients from two National Prion Reference Centres
(namely Austria and Switzerland) and assessed brain speci-
mens histologically for the presence or absence of AD-as-
sociated pathology.
Methods
We performed immunohistochemistry for Aβ on brains of
seven individuals with autopsy-confirmed iCJD (age range
28–63) after dural grafting, including two cases previously
reported [16, 17]. Dural transplants (Lyodura, Braun-
Melsungen, whenever specified) had been applied by
neurosurgery between 11 and 25 years before death. Patient
details are provided in table 1.
At least three different cortical and other brain regions were
investigated. Monoclonal anti-Aβ antibodies 6F/3D from
DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark, or 4G8 from Signet, Dedham,
MA, USA, were used after paraffin section pretreatment
with formic acid 80% for 1 hour or 100% for 5 minutes.
Each iCJD case was age-matched to three cases of sporadic
CJD (sCJD) from the Swiss or Austrian National Reference
Centres for Human Prion Diseases (age 40–63 years) (fig.
1B). As additional controls, Aβ pathology was studied in
81 sCJD cases in the expected age range (namely 55–85
years) [18] (fig. 1B) in the Austrian cohort.
Statistical comparisons were made by one-way analysis
of variance with Bonferroni correction (all groups vs all
groups, fig. 1B) and Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni
correction (fig. 1C–E).
This study was approved by the Cantonal Ethics Commis-
sion of Zurich (KEK-ZH-Nr. 2015-0672) and the Ethics
Commission of the Medical University Vienna (396/2011).
Results
Aβ was detectable in meningeal vessels as cerebral amyl-
oid angiopathy (CAA) and as plaques in gray matter of five
of seven iCJD brains (71%, age 28, 33, 47, 52, 63 years)
(fig. 1A), but in only one as CAA (5%, age 55) and in five
as parenchymal deposits (24%, age 49, 51, 62, 62, 63) of
the 21 age-matched sCJD controls (fig. 1C & D). Of note,
no conspicuous tau pathology was observed in all iCJD
patients. Moreover, all five iCJD brains with Aβ patho-
logy showed the combined presence of CAA and brain Aβ
depositions, while age-matched sCJD cases showed either
CAA or parenchymal Aβ (fig. 1E). The larger sCJD series
showed CAA in 9/81 (11%), brain Aβ deposits in 9/81
other cases, and both in one more case (fig. 1C–E). Stat-
istically, CAA was significantly more frequent in iCJD
than in age-matched sCJD (p <0.01) and sCJD (p <0.001);
brain parenchymal deposits were significantly more fre-
quent in iCJD than in sCJD (p <0.01); and their combina-
tion was significantly more frequent in iCJD than in both
age-matched sCJD and sCJD (p <0.001).

 Discussion
We report here that CAA and brain parenchymal Aβ
plaques are frequent in iCJD after dural grafting, even in
young individuals. Similarly to what was previously repor-
ted in iCJD after hGH treatment [15], we failed to detect
any marked tau pathology in our series after dural grafting.
The presence of Aβ pathology in young individuals who
present with neither a family history of early-onset demen-
tia or prominent AD-related tau pathology is highly unusu-
al and suggests a causal relationship to the dural grafts [19].
It is plausible that such pathology may have resulted from
the seeding of Aβ aggregates from the grafts to host tissues,
yet alternative explanations are also possible.
The Aβ pathology was observed many years after
neurosurgery that applied a graft of dura mater. It is in-
triguing that all cases with particularly long intervals after
dural grafting (more than 20 years) were the five who
had Aβ pathology, whereas the two brains without Aβ had
much shorter intervals of 11 and 12 years, respectively.
This does not seem to be a function of age, as both cases
without Aβ had ages in the 50s, whereas Aβ brains in-
cluded three cases younger than 50. Such prolonged in-
cubation over decades would be another striking similarity
with prion diseases. As data on the site of the applied dural
graft were not available for all cases, we were unable to in-
vestigate conclusively whether the severity of the induced
Aβ pathology had a topographic relationship to the site of
grafting. For the same reason, it was not possible to assert
any local difference between meningeal vs parenchymal
Aβ according to graft site.
The clinical signs and symptoms in all patients reported
here were typical of CJD [3]; there was no report of pre-
vious mild or slowly progressive cognitive impairment that
might have been the result of Aβ pathology prior to the on-
set of rapidly progressive iCJD. All brains had prominent
and widespread deposition of PrPSc; in comparison, Aβ was
less prominent. Thus, any striking local co-occurrence sug-
gestive of potential cross-seeding was not discernible.
The findings reported here extend a previous study of iCJD
after hGH treatment [15] and suggest that both human
dural tissue grafts and pituitary extracts are able to elicit
Aβ pathology decades later. This would be in agreement
with ample evidence of prion-like propagation of aggreg-
ated proteins in animal models of neurodegeneration [8].
However, as discussed previously [16], it is currently im-
possible to eliminate the possibility that head trauma or the
underlying conditions which had led to dural grafting, or
neurosurgery, may have contributed to the induction of Aβ
pathology.
A previous study [20] demonstrated the presence of Aβ in
human pituitary tissue, the source of prion-contaminated
hGH preparations. However, no clinically manifest cases
of AD or PD were identified among recipients of pituitary-
derived hGH in review of the large US National Hormone
and Pituitary Program cohort database [20]. Hence, further
studies are needed to elucidate whether potential trans-
mission
and
propagation
of
Aβ
–
and
of
other
neurodegeneration-related proteins – from external sources
is indeed able to induce a clinically manifest human dis-
ease.
Whilst the iatrogenic transmission of aggregated Aβ is one
of several possible explanations for the findings reported
here, the growing circumstantial evidence for such trans-
mission should prompt a critical re-evaluation of the de-
contamination procedures for surgical instruments and
drugs of biological origin, with the goal to ensure the com-
plete absence of potentially transmissible contaminants.
