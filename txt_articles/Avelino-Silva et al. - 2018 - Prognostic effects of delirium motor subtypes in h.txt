Abstract
Objectives
To investigate the association between delirium motor subtypes and hospital mortality and
12-month mortality in hospitalized older adults.
Design
Prospective cohort study conducted from 2009 to 2015.
Setting
Geriatric ward of a university hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Participants
We included 1,409 consecutive admissions of acutely ill patients aged 60 years and over.
We excluded admissions for end-of-life care, with missing data on the main variables, length
of stay shorter than 48 hours, or when consent to participate was not given.
Main outcomes and measures
Delirium was detected using the Confusion Assessment Method and categorized in hypoac-
tive, hyperactive, or mixed delirium. Primary outcomes were time to death in the hospital,
and time to death in 12 months (for the discharged sample). Comprehensive geriatric
assessment was performed at admission and included socio-demographic, clinical, func-
tional, cognitive, and laboratory variables. Further clinical data were documented upon
death or discharge. Multivariate analyses used Cox proportional hazards models adjusted
for possible confounders.
Results
We included 1,409 admissions, with a mean age of 80 years. The proportion of in-hospital
deaths was 19%, with a cumulative mortality of 38% in 12 months. Delirium occurred in 47%

 of the admissions. Hypoactive delirium was the predominant motor subtype (53%), followed
by mixed delirium (30%) and hyperactive delirium (17%). Hospital mortality rates were
respectively 33%, 34% and 15%. We verified that hypoactive and mixed delirium were inde-
pendently associated with hospital mortality, with respective hazard ratios of 2.43 (95%CI =
1.64–3.59) and 2.31 (95%CI = 1.53–3.50). Delirium motor subtypes were not independently
predictive of 12-month mortality.
Conclusions
One in three acutely ill hospitalized older adults who suffered hypoactive or mixed delirium
died in the hospital. Clinicians should be aware that hypoactive symptoms of delirium,
whether shown exclusively or in alternation with hyperactive symptoms, are indicative of a
worse prognosis in this population.
Introduction
Delirium affects up to 50% of hospitalized older adults. It is associated with several unfavorable
outcomes and it is estimated that more than US$160 billion are annually spent on the disorder
in the United States [1–3]. It typically manifests with either of two patterns of psychomotor
activity: hypoactive or hyperactive [4]. Hypoactive delirium is characterized by stupor, psycho-
motor lentification and lethargy, and is the most frequent pattern in older adults [5]. Con-
versely, hyperactive delirium is characterized by agitation, hypervigilance and hallucinations.
Cases in which an alternance of the two patterns is observed are common and classified as
mixed delirium [6].
The more exuberant hyperactive delirium is easier to detect and is often associated with
alcohol withdrawal [7]. Hypoactive delirium frequently goes undetected or is interpreted as a
mood disorder or fatigue, which can delay diagnosis and the implementation of therapeutic
measures [8, 9]. Although the hypoactive pattern is more commonly indicated in the literature
as being associated with a worse prognosis, current evidence to support this claim is conflict-
ing. Of the seven studies identified in a recent systematic review that examined the effects of
motor subtype on the clinical course of patients with delirium, only three showed an associa-
tion between hypoactive delirium and a worse prognosis [10–13]. Of the four other studies,
one concluded that hyperactive delirium had worse prognosis [14], and the other three did not
find any association between delirium motor subtypes and the examined outcomes [15–17].
The inconsistency in findings concerning delirium motor subtypes and prognosis has
important practical implications, both in the clinical and in the research context. Clinician
education and awareness to the meaning of different patterns of psychomotor activity depend
on these results. Likewise, researchers working on the evaluation of delirium severity need reli-
able data to adequately incorporate psychomotor activity in their assessment tools. For exam-
ple, commonly used scales such as the Delirium Rating Scale and the Memorial Delirium
Assessment Scale tend to value symptoms typical of hyperactive delirium, despite allusions to
hypoactive delirium as potentially more severe [18, 19].
Therefore, we proposed to add to previous studies examining the association between
delirium motor subtypes and mortality by following a large, consecutive, well characterized
sample, and adjusting our analyses to several important covariates. In this study, we sought to

 investigate the effects of delirium motor subtypes on hospital mortality and 12-month mortal-
ity of acutely ill older adults.
Methods
Study design and population
This was a prospective cohort study involving acutely ill patients admitted to a geriatric ward
of a 2,200-bed tertiary university hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This 24-bed unit admits medical
patients aged 60 years and over, and is staffed with a multidisciplinary team that includes geri-
atricians, nurses, physiotherapists, speech therapists, social workers, psychologists and nutri-
tionists. Despite age being the only criterion for admittance in the ward, as a specialty unit
with a limited number of beds, older adults with high clinical complexity and vulnerability are
preferably referred for admission.
We included consecutive hospitalizations from January 2009 to June 2015. Inclusion crite-
ria for the study were: (1) age of 60 years or over; (2) admission for acute illness (defined as
disease of recent onset, or as recent complication of chronic disease, requiring hospitalization
for clinical management). Exclusion criteria included: (1) admission for end-of-life care; (2)
incomplete data on the main variables; (2) length of stay shorter than 48 hours; (4) patient or
caregiver refusal to authorize use of hospital data for research.
Measures
Outcomes.
The primary endpoints for the study were: (1) time to death during hospitali-
zation, analyzed for the whole sample; (2) time to death in 12 months, analyzed for participants
who were discharged from the hospital.
Time to death in the hospital was documented at the end of hospitalization. Time to death
in the follow-up period was obtained by TJAS, who attempted to contact patients 12 months
after admission, in up to three telephone contacts. Dates of death were provided by family
members, who were asked to confirm the information in their copies of the death certificates.
When unable to reach patients or caregivers, TJAS examined medical records (including medi-
cal consultations, consultations with multidisciplinary team, records of tests and procedures)
to identify information regarding dates of death, or the last dates on which the participants
were known to be alive. When verifiable information was limited to the later, cases were con-
sidered lost to follow-up.
Predictors.
Patients were evaluated according to a standardized comprehensive geriatric
assessment that is routinely performed within the first 24 hours of admission [20]. Additional
information regarding the characteristics of delirium (time of onset, predominant motor sub-
type, primary precipitating factors), new diagnoses and complications, functional status, and
hospitalization summary, were recorded at discharge or death. Trained geriatric fellows per-
formed the assessments under the supervision of experienced geriatricians. Study data were
collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools [21].
Delirium was detected using the Short Confusion Assessment Method (Short CAM) [22],
both at admission and throughout the hospital stay. The CAM has been successfully validated
against different editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, and
has been reported as the most widely used standardized instrument to detect delirium in clini-
cal practice and research [23], Delirium severity was measured using the Delirium Index,
which assesses seven domains of the Long CAM (attention, thinking, level of consciousness,
orientation, memory, sensory perception, and psychomotor activity) and generates scores
ranging from zero to 21 (21 = most severe) [24], The primary independent variable was delir-
ium motor subtype, which was defined according to predominant psychomotor features as

 hyperactive, hypoactive or mixed. This classification was completed upon discharge or death
by the fellow and attending physician responsible for each case, and was based on the clinical
features presented throughout the hospital stay. Characteristics of psychomotor agitation (vol-
untary or involuntary increased level of motor activity, such as restlessness, picking at bed-
clothes, tapping fingers, making frequent or sudden changes of position) and/or retardation
(voluntary or involuntary sluggishness, staring into space, staying in one position for a long
time, or moving very slowly) were observed for during the daily clinical follow-up and were
established using the CAM Training Manual as reference [25].
Covariates of interest included: sociodemographic information (age; sex; self-reported race;
marital status; literacy; economic classification; referring unit); medical history and physical
examination data (visual and auditory deficits; vital signs; admission diagnoses); comorbidities
(Charlson Comorbidity Index) [26]; cognitive status (Clinical Dementia Rating, CDR; Short
Form of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, Short IQCODE)
[27, 28]; functional status (six activities of daily living, ADLs; each activity was scored on a
scale ranging from zero to two points and a final score was generated from the total sum of the
items; range = 0–12, 12 = best) [29]; nutritional status (Mini Nutritional Assessment, MNA)
[30]; polypharmacy (defined as the chronic use of five or more medications) [31]; laboratory
tests (hemoglobin; total leukocytes; C-reactive protein; glomerular filtration rate, GFR; urea;
sodium; potassium; sodium bicarbonate; albumin; 25-hydroxy vitamin D). To characterize
baseline cognitive status and separate it from acute impairment, informants were instructed to
respond to CDR and Short IQCODE items using conditions at 3 moths before admission as
reference for baseline status [20].
Statistical analysis
A descriptive analysis of demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics, was performed
using counts and proportions, means and standard deviations, medians and interquartile
ranges. Categorical variables were compared across the study groups (no delirium, hyperac-
tive, mixed, and hypoactive delirium) using Chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test as appropri-
ate. Continuous variables were compared using one-way ANOVA or Kruskal Wallis test as
appropriate.
Kaplan Meier curves were used to represent unadjusted hospital survival and 12-month
survival according to delirium motor subtypes, and log-rank tests to compare the groups. The
associations between delirium motor subtypes and time to death were analyzed using Cox pro-
portional hazards models, with “no delirium” as the referent category and adjusted to the fol-
lowing pre-selected covariates: age; sex; marital status; referring unit; ADL dependency level;
dementia diagnosis and severity; nutritional status; comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes,
heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, coronary disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease, cancer); polypharmacy; vital signs (heart rate, mean arteria pressure); GFR; urea; albu-
min; total leucocytes; C-reactive protein. The analyses were performed within clusters of
patients, considering each individual might have had more than one hospitalization through-
out the years. We used cluster-analysis routines which specify that the standard errors allow
for intragroup correlations, adjusting the model to the fact that observations are independent
across clusters, but not necessarily within. Since the purpose for these procedures was to group
hospitalizations from the same patient, we employed constraint-based clustering to define
groups based on medical record identifications. All statistical tests were two-tailed and an
alpha error of up to 5% was accepted. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata SE 14.1
(Stata Corp, College Station, TX).

 Ethical considerations
This study was approved by the local institutional review board (Comissao de Etica para
Analise de Projetos de Pesquisa do Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina de Uni-
versidade Sao Paulo). Written informed consent was obtained from all cases according to the
principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Capacity to consent was based on cogni-
tive assessments as described above, and determined according to the ability to clearly com-
municate decisions and understand relevant clinical information [32]. Dual consent was
obtained from participants and their legal surrogates when mild to moderate cognitive
decline was detected, and only from the surrogates when moderate to severe decline was
present.
All patient identifiable information was stored in locked cabinets and/or secure electronic
servers.
Results
Overall characteristics
There were 1,409 hospitalizations that met inclusion and exclusion criteria, representing 1,204
clusters of patients (Fig 1). Participants were predominantly aged 80 years and over, female
and from middle to low income groups (Table 1). Most admissions were referred from the
emergency department (ED) and nearly half of these cases waited at least 48 hours before
being transferred to our unit. Median length of hospital stay was of 15 days (interquartile
range, IQR = 9;26). The median Charlson Comorbity Index score was 3 (IQR = 1;5). Infectious
diseases were common at admission (48%), the most prevalent of which were pneumonia
(41%) and urinary tract infection (34%).
One in four admissions were of patients with moderate to severe dementia. Alzheimer’s dis-
ease corresponded to 38% of the cases of dementia, while vascular dementia was observed in
23% of cases, mixed dementia in 20%, and other causes in 19%. The median score in the Short
IQCODE was 3.63 (IQR = 3.13;4.56). Only 15% of the patients could be classified as having a
normal nutritional status according to the MNA, which had a median score of 8 (IQR = 5;11).
Other common geriatric syndromes in our sample were depression, urinary incontinence,
falls, sensory deficits, and pressure ulcers. In the initial laboratory assessment, the mean value
of serum albumin was low (3.2 ±0.6 g/dL) and the median value of C-reactive protein was high
(37 ng/L, IQR = 11; 88). Mean hemoglobin level at admission was 11 (±2.3) g/dL and mean
GFR was 67 (±39) mL/min.
Delirium characteristics
We identified delirium at admission in 379 (27%) hospitalizations (Table 1). We subsequently
detected delirium in the course of an additional 278 (20%) hospitalizations. Patients with delir-
ium had a mean age of 83 (±8) years and 62% were women. When compared to patients with-
out delirium, they were older (p <.001) and more often admitted from the emergency and
intensive care units (p <.001). When compared to participants without delirium, those who
suffered from the condition had a greater proportion of ADL dependency (p <.001), dementia
(p <.001) and malnutrition (p <.001). Hypoactive delirium was the most frequently observed
motor subtype in our setting (53%), followed by mixed delirium (30%) and hyperactive delir-
ium (17%). The median Delirium Index score was 13 (IQR = 9;16), which is suggestive of
moderate delirium symptom severity, and we did not find differences in scores between delir-
ium motor subtypes.

 Unadjusted mortality
A total of 265 (19%) older adults died in the hospital and an additional 272 died in the follow-
up period after discharge. In-hospital mortality reached 30% in the delirium group, but was of
only 9% in the non-delirious group (Pearson X2 = 109; p <.001). After discharge, 12-month
mortality reached 32% in the delirium group, compared to 18% in the group without delirium
(Pearson X2 = 27; p <.001). We found the following hospital mortality rates according to
delirium motor subtypes: 15% for hyperactive delirium; 34% for mixed delirium; and 33%
for hypoactive delirium. After discharge, the proportion of 12-month deaths for hyperactive,
mixed and hypoactive delirium were, respectively, 34%, 27% and 34%. The probabilities of sur-
vival differed according to delirium motor subtype and are represented in Fig 2.
Effects of delirium motor subtypes on mortality
We verified an independent association between hypoactive and mixed delirium subtypes and
hospital mortality in a model adjusted for several possible confounders (age, sex, marital status,
Fig 1. Flowchart of inclusion and follow-up in the study. A total of 1,409 admissions from 2009 to 2015 were
included in the study, with 657 cases of delirium. Hypoactive delirium was identified in 348 admissions, followed by
mixed delirium (197) and hyperactive delirium (112). Missing data represented only a minor proportion of the sample
and was excluded from the analysis.

Table 2). We did not observe a statistically significant association between the hyperactive
form of delirium and hospital mortality. After the adjusted analysis, we could also not demon-
strate an independent association between any of the delirium motor subtypes and 12-month
mortality (Table 3). Age, admission from the ED, malnutrition, cancer, low GFR, leukocytosis
and hypoalbuminemia had statistically significant associations with decreased hospital sur-
vival. Age, admission from intensive care units, functional dependency, low GFR and elevated
C-reactive protein level were predictive of higher 12-month mortality.
Discussion
In our cohort of acutely ill hospitalized older adults, we observed that delirium occurred in
47% of admissions. One in three of these admissions resulted in death during hospitalization,
with a cumulative mortality of 52% in 12 months. The high frequency of delirium and elevated
mortality rates are consistent with data reported in the literature [7, 33]. We found that the
predominant motor subtype of delirium was the hypoactive form (53%), and that hospitalized
older adults with hypoactive delirium, either exclusively or in alternation with the hyperactive
pattern, had a substantially lower hospital survival than patients without delirium or with
pure hyperactive delirium. In contrast, we did not verify statistically significant associations
between delirium motor subtypes and 12-month mortality. Other factors demonstrated to
have prognostic importance in our cohort were age, admission from ED or ICU, functional
dependency, malnutrition, cancer, reduced GFR, hypoalbuminemia, leukocytosis, and ele-
vated C-reactive protein.
Although hypoactive delirium is usually described as potentially more severe than the other
forms [34], results presented in the literature on their prognostic differences are sparse and
conflicting. The discordance may result from disparities in how psychomotor activity subtypes
were determined, or from differences in sample characteristics, but might also originate from
methodological limitations. Kiely et al. (2007) conducted a study in eight post-acute care facili-
ties and found that hypoactive delirium was associated with 1.6 times the rate (hazard) of
12-month mortality when compared to normal psychomotor activity [10]. The study included
457 patients with delirium and adjusted the analyses for important covariates, but their results

 higher risk of death [12]. In another study, Meagher et al. (2011) reported an association
between hypoactive delirium and death within one month of inclusion in a cohort of 100 hos-
pitalized patients in palliative care [13]. However, the analysis was not adjusted for possible
confounding factors, and the morbidity and mortality profile of the selected population (i.e.
palliative care) might have limited the external validity of the results to settings with similar
goals of care.
In contrast, Marcantonio et al. (2002) reported in a sample of 122 older adults with delirium
following hip fracture repair that hyperactive symptoms were associated with a six-fold
increase in the odds of death or institutionalization [14]. It is noteworthy, however, that most

 of the cases were classified as hypoactive delirium, and that because only 2 patients presented
with hyperactive delirium in its pure form, these were grouped with the cases of mixed delir-
ium, raising concerns that the conclusion that hyperactive features of delirium were associated
with increased mortality might have been over simplified. Kelly et al. (2001), DeCrane et al.
(2011), and Slor et al. (2013) did not observe independent associations between delirium
motor subtypes and mortality [15–17]. The first two studies analyzed the prognosis of delirium
patients in nursing homes, while the third conducted a prospective study following older
adults undergoing hip fracture repair. Nevertheless, interpretation of their results was limited
by factors such as small sample sizes and lack of adjustments for potential confounders.

 The association of hypoactive and mixed delirium subtypes with a worse prognosis was
demonstrated even after adjusting the analysis for demographic, clinical and laboratory char-
acteristics. In one of the earliest studies on delirium motor subtypes, Liptzin and Levkoff
(1992) suggested that, in most cases, the expression of characteristics associated with hyperac-
tive delirium would only happen in individuals who were sufficiently fit to manifest agitation
[35]. This theory is consistent with the fact that hypoactive delirium is more common in older,
frailer, more dependent patients, and therefore with the perception that it might be a marker
of clinical vulnerability. The higher incidence of hypoactive delirium in long term care facili-
ties and geriatric wards, like ours, is also consistent with this understanding [16].
It has been suggested that subtyping delirium according to altered level of arousal, which is
one of the components of delirium psychomotor activity, could be simpler and easier to stan-
dardize [36]. However, it is still unclear how level of arousal relates to prognosis in patients
with delirium. Han et al. (2017) observed in a cohort of 1,084 older adults from the emergency
department that only delirium with normal arousal was significantly associated with increased
mortality, compared to the no delirium group [37]. Further studies are needed to understand
the clinical value of subtyping delirium only according to arousal level as compared to assess-
ing additional characteristics of psychomotor activity.
Our findings on the high frequency and poor prognosis associated with hypoactive mani-
festations of delirium have particular relevance for clinical practice, since it is documented that
physicians and nurses have greater difficulty in recognizing these cases [9]. This fact, added to
the challenge of engaging the affected individuals in beneficial activities for their recovery,
may impair therapeutic efficacy and subsequent clinical outcomes. Reports on the association
between hypoactive delirium and other complications such as functional decline, worse quality
of life, pressure ulcers and nosocomial infections, reinforce the need to expand the knowledge
about the best strategies for its management [38].
Our study had limitations. It was conducted in a single center, in a unit specialized in the
care of geriatric patients with high clinical complexity and vulnerability. Although many of
our results are consistent with those described by other groups, these aspects may have
decreased their external validity. A large proportion of patients spent more than 48 hours in
the ED, which might have led to detection bias of delirium, as it could have resolved before
referral to our unit. Still, the high prevalence of delirium found at admission suggests the num-
ber of cases missed in the ED is likely to have been minimum. The prolonged hospital stay and
high mortality are noteworthy as well, but it is likely that these results are the product of a set-
ting reserved for patients with the highest clinical severity, and of a health care system ineffi-
cient in providing high quality primary care and effective post-acute rehabilitation.
We sought with this study to provide new evidence to a field that still lacks consensus infor-
mation. To this end, we examined the association of delirium motor subtypes with mortality,
adjusting our analyses for numerous clinical variables that have not yet been simultaneously
controlled for in this context. Nevertheless, delirium is a complex and multifaceted syndrome,
and it is reasonable to assume that there are predictors of mortality in this population that
were not measured or contemplated. Among these factors, the duration of delirium episodes is
one aspect that has been indicated as a prognostic marker and was not investigated in our
work [11]. The interface between delirium motor subtypes and delirium severity also needs to
be further explored. Even though Delirium Index contemplates drowsiness and unresponsive-
ness in several of its items, only one of them is specific to motor disturbances, therefore assess-
ments that provided additional granularity to this element would be important.
Finally, categorizing delirium by its psychomotor subtypes can be complex and, despite
using CAM guidelines to characterize psychomotor agitation and/or retardation, we did not
formally apply an existing instrument to classify the different delirium subtypes, such as the

 Delirium Motor Subtype Scale [5]. The involvement of multiple geriatric fellows as study
examiners performing geriatric assessments may also have affected the reliability of the mea-
sures, although they were routinely trained to ensure the consistency of the method. Previous
studies have reported a substantial proportion of delirious patients with normal psychomotor
activity [12]. While this has not been our experience and that of other groups [39], we must
accept the possibility that cases of delirium without motor disturbances might have been mis-
classified. Nonetheless, we believe that due to the exuberant nature of the hyperactive symp-
toms of delirium, it is unlikely that cases with normal psychomotor activity would have been
misclassified as having hyperactive delirium. On the other hand, while there could be a greater
risk of categorizing normal motor subtype of delirium as hypoactive delirium, this would
probably have pulled our results towards the null [10], meaning that the associations we found
would in fact be even greater.
The study also had many positive aspects. This is one of the largest cohorts ever to be ana-
lyzed investigating the effects of delirium motor subtypes on the mortality of acutely ill older
adults. The sample size provided adequate power to detect statistically significant associations
and allowed us to adjust the multivariate analysis models for various relevant characteristics.
Data were recorded prospectively and systematically, following a standardized model of com-
prehensive geriatric assessment, which allowed for a detailed view of the health of the patients
admitted to our unit. After discharge, loss to follow-up was under 5% and non-differential
between non-delirium and delirium groups, minimizing this issue as a potential source of bias.
Lastly, the ward routines ensured a horizontal follow-up of its clientele, with supervision by
experienced geriatricians and daily discussions on all the admissions, which reduced the risk
of non-detection of delirium and other geriatric syndromes.
Characterization of delirium motor subtypes is a potentially important element to identify
patients at high risk for poor clinical outcomes. This type of evaluation can assist in the selec-
tion of candidates for targeted therapeutic interventions, resource allocation, and decisions on
advanced life support. The possibility of stratifying risk can be useful for health professionals
who need to help patients and families better understand the clinical recovery process and
likely outcomes [7]. Our study indicates that the occurrence of delirium in its hypoactive and
mixed subtypes should be used in the prediction of hospital mortality in acutely ill older adults.
Still, the attending staff must be attentive to the importance of other clinical characteristics to
estimate short and/or long-term survival. Future studies should focus on the use of motor sub-
types to refine measures of delirium severity, and on individualized strategies to improve clini-
cal outcomes.
