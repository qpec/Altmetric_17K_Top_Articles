Abstract
CRISPR-Cas systems provide protection against viral1 and plasmid2 infection by capturing short 
DNA sequences from these invaders and integrating them into the CRISPR locus of the 
prokaryotic host1. These sequences, known as spacers, are transcribed into short RNA guides3–5 
that specify the cleavage site of Cas nucleases in the genome of the invader6–8. When spacer 
sequences are acquired during viral infection is not known. To investigate this, we followed spacer 
acquisition in Staphylococcus aureus cells harboring a type II CRISPR-Cas9 system after infection 
with the staphylococcal bacteriophage ϕ12. We found that new spacers are acquired immediately 
following infection preferentially from the cos site, the viral free DNA end that is first injected 
into the cell. Analysis of spacer acquisition after infection with mutant phages demonstrated that 
most spacers are acquired during DNA injection, but not during other stages of the viral cycle that 
produce free DNA ends, such as DNA replication or packaging. Finally, we showed that spacers 
acquired from early-injected genomic regions, which direct Cas9 cleavage of the viral DNA 
immediately after infection, provide better immunity than spacers acquired from late-injected 
regions. Our results reveal that CRISPR-Cas systems exploit the phage life cycle to generate a 
pattern of spacer acquisition that ensures the success of the CRISPR immune response.
The acquisition of new spacer sequences from foreign DNA elements is hallmark of the 
CRISPR-Cas immune response1. The molecular mechanisms of this process, also known as 
CRISPR adaptation, have mostly been studied in the type I CRISPR-Cas system of 
Escherichia coli, one of the six different CRISPR-Cas types9. Recent work in this bacterium 
examined the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas autoimmunity; i.e. the acquisition of spacer 
sequences from the host genome and resident plasmids10. In this scenario, new spacers are

 acquired primarily from the chromosomal terminus, due to the presence of double-stranded 
DNA breaks (DSBs) that occur during replisome stalling. Adaptation is limited by 
chromosomal chi sequences and strongly depends on RecBCD, a complex required for the 
repair of genomic breaks in Gram-negative bacteria11 that degrades DNA starting at the 
DSB and stopping at the chi site. It is believed that this degradation generates the DNA 
substrates used as new spacers that are incorporated into the CRISPR array by the Cas1-
Cas2 integrase complex10. However, it remains unclear how and when new spacers are 
acquired from phages and other common prokaryotic invaders during the CRISPR-Cas 
immune response.
Here we studied spacer acquisition in the Gram-positive bacterium S. aureus RN4220, which 
lacks an endogenous CRISPR system, harboring a plasmid engineered to carry the 
Streptococcus pyogenes type II-A CRISPR-Cas locus (Extended Data Fig. 1a), an 
experimental system that was previously developed in our lab12. Cas9 is the crRNA-guided 
nuclease of this system13,14, which requires the presence of a protospacer adjacent motif 
(PAM) immediately downstream of the target with the sequence NGG13,15. To avoid the 
potentially confusing effects of primed adaptation, a form of more frequent spacer 
acquisition that relies on the presence of pre-existing spacers with partial matches to the 
invading genome16, we removed all spacers from the type II-A CRISPR locus and left only a 
single repeat sequence. We also used a cas9 allele, hyper-cas9 or hcas9, that enhances spacer 
acquisition by two orders of magnitude17. Using this system and a PCR amplification 
technique that enriches for newly incorporated spacers (Extended Data Fig. 1a), we were 
able to detect rare spacer acquisition events occurring minutes after phage infection. We first 
looked at the autoimmunity pattern of chromosomal spacer acquisition during exponential 
growth. The PCR products of adapted CRISPR loci were subjected to next generation 
sequencing and the reads per million (RPM) for each new spacer sequence was calculated 
(full data for all next generation sequencing experiments in this manuscript is provided in 
Supplementary Data File 1; a summary of this data in table format is provided in s). Plotting 
the RPM values for spacers of chromosomal origin along the S. aureus genome revealed a 
strong adaptation hotspot surrounding the dif site, which marks the terminus of the circular 
bacterial chromosome (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1b–e). The peak is limited by the first 
staphylococcal chi sequence (5′-GAAGCGG-3′)18 upstream from the dif site on each DNA 
strand (Extended Data Fig. 1b–e). In addition, the introduction of an I-sceI site19 resulted in 
an additional adaptation hotspot when the I-SceI endonuclease was expressed, again limited 
by chi sites (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1f–g). These results demonstrate that both type I 
and type II CRISPR-Cas systems can utilize DSBs as the source of new spacers for CRISPR 
adaptation.
Are DSBs and/or free DNA ends also used for spacer acquisition during the CRISPR-Cas 
immune response against viral infection? If so, when during the life cycle of the invading 
virus are these DSBs and free DNA ends generated? Free DNA ends can be found in several 
stages of the infectious cycle of lambda-like dsDNA (double-stranded DNA) bacteriophages, 
for example following DNA injection, through accidental DNA breaks during theta 
replication, following the transition to rolling circle replication and throughout DNA 
packaging20. To address this fundamental question, we analyzed the incorporation of new 
spacers shortly after infection with the lambda-like ϕ12γ3 bacteriophage (Extended Data

 Fig. 2a–b), a lytic derivative of the temperate dsDNA staphylococcal phage ϕ1221. We first 
estimated the onset of ϕ12γ3 lysis at approximately 45 minutes (Extended Data Fig. 2c); 
therefore we chose to analyze spacer acquisition at 30 minutes post-infection, when most 
phages are still going through the first lytic cycle. In this way we avoided the selection and 
counter-selection of spacer sequences that produce more or less efficient crRNAs, 
respectively, that occurs during multiple rounds of infection, and which could skew the 
original distribution of newly acquired spacers. In contrast to the acquisition of 
chromosomal spacer sequences (where the CRISPR adaptation hotspot was flanked by two 
symmetrically opposed chi sites), the majority of newly acquired viral spacers mapped to a 
13 kb region (the ϕ12 genome encompasses 45 kb) flanked by the cos site and its first 
upstream chi site, both in experiments with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 (Fig. 1b) 
and 1 (Extended Data Fig. 3a). The cos site marks the viral free DNA ends that are 
generated by staggered cleavage of the phage DNA during packaging, which serve as 
cohesive ends for re-circularization of the linear phage genome following DNA injection22 
(Extended Data Fig. 2d–e). The cos-adjacent pattern of spacer acquisition was not 
introduced by the enrichment primers or the use of the hcas9 allele (Extended Data Fig. 4), 
was observed on both DNA strands upstream from the cos site (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c) 
and was not simply a reflection of the PAM sequence distribution on the phage genome 
(Extended Data Fig. 5d–e). Efficient spacer acquisition depended on the AddAB repair 
machinery, the Gram-positive functional paralog of RecBCD11, since S. aureus hosts 
harboring a mutation in the nuclease active site of the AddA subunit (addAn) led to a 
significant reduction of spacer acquisition, with a small peak clustered closely to the cos site 
and not reaching the first chi site (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 3b–c). In addition, the 
introduction of two extra chi sites ~2.5 kb upstream of the ϕ12γ3 cos site created a new limit 
for the spacer acquisition hotspot, with a peak occurring immediately adjacent to the cos site 
(Extended Data Fig. 3d). Altogether these results demonstrate that CRISPR adaptation 
against ϕ12γ3 exploits the presence of a natural and invariable free DNA end at the cos site 
of the virus to generate new spacers.
The results of figure 1b suggest that new spacers could be acquired soon after injection of 
the viral DNA. It is also possible that spacer acquisition occurs during cos site cleavage at 
the initiation of genome packaging by terminase enzymes23 and/or, similarly to the case of 
chromosomal spacer acquisition near the genome terminus, DSBs generated during viral 
DNA replication could be substrates for CRISPR adaptation (Extended Data Fig. 6a). To 
distinguish between these possibilities we measured spacer acquisition in ϕ12γ3 mutants 
impaired at different stages of the lytic cycle (Extended Data Fig. 6a–d). polA mutant 
phages lack DNA polymerase A and cannot replicate the injected genome (Fig. 2a), cannot 
continue the lytic cycle after injection and produce neither intracellular (Fig. 2b) nor 
extracellular viral particles (Fig. 2c). Therefore these mutants provide a measure of the level 
of spacer acquisition that occurs following injection and before replication (Extended Data 
Fig. 6a–b). terS mutants lack the small subunit of the terminase complex and are incapable 
of cos site cleavage by this complex during DNA packaging23. After DNA injection they can 
replicate their genome (Fig. 2a) but cannot form functional intracellular (Fig. 2b) nor 
extracellular viral particles (Fig. 2c). Thus spacer acquisition in the terS mutants can occur 
during DNA injection and/or replication but before DNA packaging (Extended Data Fig. 6a–

 b). Finally, phages with a deletion encompassing the genes encoding the holin and lysin 
enzymes (ho/ly) are impaired at host lysis24, but they can replicate (Fig. 2a) and package 
their DNA, producing intracellular (Fig. 2b) but not extracellular (Fig. 2c) viral particles. In 
this mutant, spacer acquisition can occur throughout DNA injection, replication and/or 
packaging, but not during a second infectious cycle (Extended Data Fig. 6a–b). First we 
compared adaptation levels between terS and ho/ly mutants at 0 and 60 minutes post-
infection, when DNA packaging is mostly completed in the ho/ly mutant (Fig. 2b). We did 
not detect significant differences in spacer incorporation between these two infections, both 
quantitatively (Fig. 2d) and qualitatively (Extended Data Fig. 6e), demonstrating that the 
free DNA ends generated at the cos site during phage DNA packaging do not contribute 
substantially to the generation of new spacers. To measure how much CRISPR adaptation 
occurs during phage DNA replication we compared the levels of spacer acquisition between 
polA and ho/ly mutants at 0 and 30 minutes post-infection, when DNA levels in the ho/ly 
mutant are ~30-fold higher than in the polA mutant (Fig. 2c). Both mutants allowed similar 
spacer incorporation into the CRISPR array both quantitatively (Fig. 2e) and qualitatively 
(Extended Data Fig. 6f), demonstrating that replication is not a major stage in the viral cycle 
for the acquisition of new spacers. These results suggest that the great majority of new 
spacers are acquired early in the phage life-cycle, during or shortly after injection of the viral 
dsDNA ends. In addition, because the phage mutants cannot propagate, these results show 
that the pattern of spacer acquisition is not a result of selection generated by multiple 
infection cycles. One prediction of this conclusion is that adaptation rates should scale with 
the MOI, which directly determines how many phage dsDNA ends are injected. Indeed, we 
found that adaptation rates are linearly correlated with MOI (Extended Data Fig 6g). A 
second prediction is that the region of the phage genome that is first injected into the host 
would be the source of most of the new spacers. To test this we inverted the cos site (116 
base pairs) of ϕ12γ3, generating ϕ12γ3cos-flip (Fig. 2f), a phage with an inverted order of 
entry. In contrast to the pattern of CRISPR adaptation obtained following challenge with 
wild type phages, during infection with the mutant phage a minority of spacers were 
acquired from the region upstream of the cos site, with the highest spacer density mapping 
downstream of the flipped cos site at both MOI of 10 (Fig. 2g) and 1 (Extended Data Fig. 
3a). Acquisition peaks in ϕ12γ3cos-flip were lower but covered a larger area compared to 
those in ϕ12γ3, likely because there are no chi sites in the reverse strand of the ϕ12 genome 
to limit and concentrate adaptation activity. In addition, spacer acquisition from ϕ12γ3cos-flip 
in the addAn mutant displayed a major peak within 5 kb of the cos site, a mirror image 
pattern of that observed for ϕ12γ3 (Extended Data Fig. 3e). Altogether, the data in figure 2 
demonstrate that the acquisition of spacer sequences by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation 
machinery occurs primarily from the viral dsDNA ends first introduced during the injection 
of the ϕ12γ3 genome.
This pattern of spacer acquisition presents a potential advantage to the immunized host 
population upon subsequent phage encounters, since the cos-adjacent spacers will direct the 
Cas9 nuclease to cleave the next invading virus shortly after its injection. To test this we 
generated a library of spacers evenly distributed throughout the ϕ12γ3 genome (Figs. 3a and 
Extended Data Figures 7a–f). Cells harboring this library were infected with ϕ12γ3 or 
ϕ12γ3cos-flip phages in conditions where the incorporation of additional spacers is inhibited

 (see Extended Data Figure 7c–d). Staphylococci surviving infection overnight were 
collected and their spacer content was assessed by next-generation sequencing to determine 
if the selective pressure of the phage enriched for spacers targeting any particular region of 
ϕ12γ3. Indeed, spacers targeting the region immediately upstream of the cos site were 
enriched after infection with wild type ϕ12γ3 (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Figure 7g); i.e. the 
region that is injected first. The opposite pattern was observed following ϕ12γ3cos-flip 
infection, with the enrichment of spacers targeting the region downstream of the flipped cos 
site (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Figure 7g). This pattern of selection, opposite for spacers 
targeting different sides of the cos site, is more evident when spacer enrichment is plotted as 
the ratio of ϕ12γ3/ϕ12γ3cos-flip RPMs (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Figure 7h). These results 
suggest that during the targeting phase of CRISPR-Cas immunity, Cas9 cleavage of early-
injected phage sequences provides better phage clearance than the cleavage of late-injected 
sequences. To corroborate this, we used a type II CRISPR-Cas system lacking the 
adaptation-specific genes cas1, cas2 and csn2 (strictly required for spacer acquisition12), and 
expressing Cas9 programmed with spacers targeting viral sequences immediately (within 1 
kb) upstream or downstream from the cos site (Fig. 3c). During infection with wild type 
ϕ12γ3 the three upstream spacers target the first region to be injected; during infection with 
ϕ12γ3cos-flip the order of targeting is inverted (Fig. 3c). In host populations where all 
bacteria carry one of these six spacer sequences, CRISPR-Cas immunity allows cell survival 
upon infection with either of the two phages at low MOI (Extended Data Fig. 8). However, 
the incorporation of new spacers during CRISPR immunization is a very rare event1,12. To 
mimic this situation, we mixed bacteria programmed with either the three upstream or 
downstream spacers with staphylococci lacking a CRISPR-Cas plasmid at a ratio of 
1:10,00025, resulting in extremely high MOIs following the lysis of non-CRISPR cells. We 
then infected the mixed cultures with either ϕ12γ3 or ϕ12γ3cos-flip. The population 
harboring the three upstream targeting spacers was able to recover and survive ϕ12γ3 but 
not ϕ12γ3cos-flip infection (Fig. 3d). In contrast, the culture carrying the three downstream 
targeting spacers recovered and survived ϕ12γ3cos-flip but not ϕ12γ3 infection (Fig. 3e). 
These data confirm that target location can strongly influence the efficiency of Cas9 
targeting, especially immediately following CRISPR adaptation, when only a small fraction 
of cells acquire a new spacer. Altogether, our results demonstrate that spacer acquisition 
from early-injected viral sequences is an effective strategy for establishing a robust CRISPR-
Cas immune response.
Our study showed that type II CRISPR-Cas systems use free DNA ends as an entry point for 
the acquisition of new spacers. During infection by dsDNA phages, the linear genomic end 
is injected first. We demonstrated that this initial step in viral infection is exploited by the 
CRISPR-Cas immune response both to acquire new anti-viral spacers and to direct Cas 
nucleases to the invading target rapidly after infection begins, immediately halting the lytic 
cycle (Extended Data Fig. 9). At the same time the preference for free DNA ends could 
provide a mechanism to prioritize the acquisition of spacers from the invading virus, which 
produces free DNA ends as an obligate life-cycle step, over acquisition from chromosomal 
DNA (to avoid CRISPR “autoimmunity”). Our studies used the staphylococcal phage ϕ12, 
whose DNA packaging mechanism ensures that every viral particle injects the cos site first 
(Extended Data Fig. 10a–b). Analysis of the pattern of spacer acquisition after infection with

 the pac staphylococcal phage ϕNM4γ4, which lacks a defined genomic entry site, also 
shows a mode of spacer incorporation consistent with CRISPR adaptation during phage 
DNA injection (Extended Data Fig. 10c–d), suggesting that our findings apply to both cos 
and pac dsDNA phages. We propose that, although not strictly required for spacer 
acquisition (Extended Data Fig. 3e), DNA degradation by AddAB of the injected viral 
genome (which starts at the cos site and ends at the first chi site) generates additional free 
DNA ends that are used as substrates for the Cas1-Cas2-Csn2-Cas9 spacer acquisition 
complex12 to incorporate new viral sequences in the CRISPR array (Extended Data Fig. 9). 
We did not detect significant spacer acquisition in the opposite direction of the cos site; i.e. 
from the cos site DNA end that enters the cell last, a result that suggests that spacer 
acquisition occurs during DNA ejection. Interestingly, many dsDNA phages have evolved to 
protect their ends from this degradation by producing proteins that cap the injected dsDNA 
end or that inhibit RecBCD/AddAB26. It is tempting to speculate that the low frequency of 
spacer acquisition is related to these protection mechanisms, which would limit the 
generation of substrates for the Cas1-Cas2-Csn2-Cas9 complex. In this case, these 
mechanisms would provide a double protection for the phage, from RecBCD/AddAB 
degradation and CRISPR adaptation. Recent studies have shown that the injection of the 
phage lambda genome takes on average five minutes and can last up to twenty minutes27; 
this provides a window of opportunity for spacer acquisition before DNA injection is 
complete. It also provides a window for the cleavage of the viral DNA before it is 
completely ejected, something that we found to be important for an effective type II 
CRISPR-Cas immune response. Finally, CRISPR-Cas systems also acquire spacers from 
conjugative plasmids2 most of which transfer to neighboring cells as ssDNA. Since ssDNA 
is not a good substrate for RecBCD28, it is improbable that spacer acquisition happens 
during plasmid transfer. Most likely it occurs during plasmid replication, as reported 
previously10. In conclusion, our study highlights the intimate relationship between both 
stages of CRISPR-Cas immunity, immunization and targeting, and reveals how these 
immune systems have exploited the biology of phage infection to provide robust protection 
against prokaryotic predators.
Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Cultivation of S. aureus RN422029 and E. coli strains were carried out in brain-heart 
infusion (BHI) or LB liquid media (BD) respectively at 37°C, 30°C for maintenance of 
pE194-derived temperature sensitive plasmids or 28°C for maintenance of pIMAY-based 
plasmids. S. aureus media were supplemented with chloramphenicol at 10 μg/ml, 
erythromycin at 10 μg/ml, kanamycin at 25 μg/ml or spectinomycin at 250 μg/ml. E. coli 
media were supplemented with chloramphenicol at 25 μg/ml, ampicillin at 100 μg/ml, 
kanamycin at 50 μg/ml or spectinomycin at 50 μg/ml for plasmid maintenance. Media was 
supplemented with 1 mM IPTG to express genes from the inducible promoters Pspac and 
Pspac(h) and with 2 μg/ml mitomycin C (A&G Scientific) to induce prophage excision and

 PCR amplification of expanded CRISPR loci
CRISPR plasmids were harvested from S. aureus cells with a modified QIAprep Spin 
Miniprep Kit protocol: Bacterial cell pellets were resuspended in 250 μl of P1 buffer 
supplemented with 107 μg/ml lysostaphin (AMBI Products) and incubated at 37°C for 10 
minutes followed by the standard QIAprep protocol. 150 ng (log phase) or 50 ng (overnight) 
of plasmid were used as input for the enrichment PCR of the CRISPR locus using Phusion 
DNA Polymerase (Thermo) with the following primer mix: 3 parts JW8 and 1 part each 
JW3, JW4 and JW5 (Extended Data Table 1). Variants of the primer JW8 with 3–8 bp bar 
codes at the 5′ end were used to distinguish experiments from each other during 
multiplexed high-throughput sequencing. PCRs with conventional primers were performed 
similarly using primers JW1131 and L401 with 5′ bar codes for multiplexing. Amplicons 
were gel or PCR purified and subjected to Illumina high-throughput sequencing with either 
the MiSeq, HiSeq or NextSeq platforms.
Deep sequencing data analysis
Spacers were aligned to chromosomal, plasmid and phage genomes using the Burrows-
Wheeler Aligner30. Perfectly aligned spacers were assigned to the position in the reference 
genome at the 5′ end of the alignment, and the number of spacers occurring at each 
genomic position was aggregated. Two layers of normalization were next applied. First, 
spacer counts were multiplied by a factor which accounted for the base at that spacer’s 3′-
end. The enrichment PCR leverages the clamping of the reverse primers’ 3-end (T, A or G) 
with the 3′ ends of newly acquired spacers12. A reverse primer ending in C is omitted from 
the primer mix in order to avoid priming against the single repeat in non-adapted plasmids. 
Because of the increased G-C bond strength relative to A-T, spacers ending in C are 
overrepresented compared to spacers ending in A or T. Spacers ending G, as well as non-
adapted loci, are observed at low frequencies despite the absence of a perfectly matching 
reverse primer, likely because of 3′ trimming during primer synthesis or PCR. We therefore 
examined the observed frequencies of spacers ending in A, T, C or G following enrichment 
PCR and multiplied each by a factor that normalized the frequencies to the expected values 
of 22.8%, 41.9%, 18.1% and 17.2%. These values reflect the observed frequencies for 
phage- or chromosomally-derived spacers following amplification with non-enrichment 
primers (Extended Data Fig. S6a–b). When using conventional primers, the spacer 3′ base 
normalization step was skipped. Following the further aggregation of read counts into 1kb 
(phage) or 10kb (S. aureus chromosome) bins, we multiplied each bin by a factor accounting 
for the number of GG sequences within that bin, and on a given DNA strand where 
applicable. This is based on the observation that adaptation occurs primarily at sites 
immediately upstream from a 5′-NGG-3′ sequence, known as the PAM12. Finally, reads per 
million (RPM) were calculated either as RPMtot, RPMspc, RPMϕ12 or RPMchr. RPMtot 
corresponds to phage reads within a bin per million total CRISPR loci (including adapted 
and unadapted sites), while RPMspc corresponds to phage reads per million total spacers 
(from chromosomal, plasmid and phage sequences). These are measures of absolute spacer 
acquisition rates where RPMtot is used for comparisons across different host cell genetic 
backgrounds and RPMspc for comparisons within the same genetic background. RPMϕ12 
refers to phage reads within a bin per million total phage reads. RPMchr refers to

 chromosomal reads within a bin per million total chromosomal reads. RPMϕ12 and RPMchr 
highlight the distribution of acquired spacers within a given genome.
Phage construction
We used a variation of a method previously described31. ϕ12γ3 was isolated as a 
spontaneous escaper plaque following an infection of ϕ12 on a soft agar lawn of S. aureus 
RN4220 cells carrying plasmid pJW479, which encodes a type III CRISPR-Cas system 
targeting the ϕ12 cI-like repressor. PCR of the cI locus confirmed a 1347 bp deletion 
spanning the complete cI gene and the first 616 base pairs of the upstream gene (RNaseT 
family protein) as indicated in Extended Data Fig. 2a. ϕ12γ3cos-flip was created by 
propagating ϕ12γ3 in liquid culture in cells harboring plasmid pJW481 which contains the 
flipped cos site and surrounding upstream and downstream homology regions for 
recombination with the phage genome. Recombinant ϕ12γ3cos-flip plaques were recovered 
on a soft agar lawn of RN4220 cells carrying plasmid pJW482, which encodes a type III 
CRISPR-Cas system targeting a sequence present only in ϕ12γ3 and not in ϕ12γ3cos-flip. 
ϕ12γ3chi-extra was created in a similar fashion to ϕ12γ3cos-flip with pJW484 and pJW483 
substituted for the recombination and targeting plasmids respectively.
Strain construction
The addAn (D1159A) nuclease domain mutation was introduced into the S. aureus RN4220 
genome (generating strain JW418) using the pIMAY allelic replacement system32 with 
plasmid pJW233. An I-sceI recognition site immediately adjacent to a kanamycin-resistance 
gene (for selection purposes) was introduced into the S. aureus RN4220 genome at the srtA 
locus (generating strain JW263) using the pMAD allelic replacement system33 with plasmid 
pJW480. Mutations in ϕ12 were introduced into strains of S. aureus RN4220 harboring the 
ϕ12 prophage using the pWJ244/pWJ327 allelic replacement system developed in our lab by 
Wenyan Jiang. A pWJ244-derived suicide vector containing the ho/ly mutation was 
introduced by electroporation into S. aureus RN4220∷ϕ12 lysogens. Co-integrants 
(containing the plasmid integrated into the chromosome via recombination) were isolated on 
BHI agar plates supplemented with chloramphenicol grown at 37°C. pWJ327-derived 
temperature sensitive plasmids containing the polA and terS mutations were introduced by 
electroporation into S. aureus RN4220∷ϕ12 lysogens and colonies were grown on plates 
supplemented with chloramphenicol at 28°C. Co-integrants were isolated by re-streaking 
colonies from 28°C plates directly onto 37°C plates. Co-integrants of pWJ244 or pWJ327 
were re-struck onto a second chloramphenicol plate and grown at 37°C to remove non-
transformed, background cells, and their genotype confirmed by PCR using primers that 
amplify the integration site. Bona-fide co-integrants were grown overnight in plain media at 
28°C. Logarithmic-phase cultures were treated with the pWJ326 counter-selection 
phagemid, producing a Cas9 nuclease programmed to target and destroy the cat gene of the 
integrated plasmid, for 1 hour and plated on BHI agar supplemented with erythromycin at 
30°C. The selected mutants were confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing and by 
checking their growth on chloramphenicol plates at 37°C (to ensure chloramphenicol-
sensitivity). Mutants were re-struck at 30°C on BHI agar supplemented with erythromycin, 
and colonies were inoculated overnight in plain BHI at 37°C to inhibit replication of 
pWJ326 and cure this counter-selection plasmid. Overnight cultures were plated on plain

 BHI agar at 37°C, and colonies were replica-plated on both plain BHI agar at 37°C and BHI 
agar supplemented with erythromycin at 30°C to check for plasmid loss. With this method, 
strains JW924, JW833 and JW563, containing the polA, terS and ho/ly mutations, were 
created using plasmids pJW430, pJW410 and pJW271 respectively.
Propagation of ϕ12 mutants
For the experiments in Fig. 2c–g, infections were performed at an approximate MOI of 10. 
Subsequently, the precise MOI was determined for each experiment, and the qPCR data and 
adaptation bar graphs were normalized to this precise MOI. Supplementary Data File 2 
shows the exact MOI for each experiment.
pWJ326 phagemid propagation
S. aureus ST24 cells34 harboring plasmid pWJ326 were inoculated at 30°C in BHI 
supplemented with erythromycin. Spontaneous induction of the prophage 80α results in the 
exclusive phage packaging of pWJ326, which harbors the sequence for the 80α packaging 
(pac) site, within the 80α terS gene. pWJ326 phagemids were isolated by concentrating the 
supernatant of overnight S. aureus ST24/pWJ326 cultures using Amicon Ultra centrifugal 
filter units (EMD Millipore) and resuspending the retentate in 1/10 the original volume of 
PBS.
Propagation of ϕ12 mutants

plasmids pJW474, pJW383 and pJW278 respectively, were induced from logarithmic phase 
cultures by the simultaneous addition of 2 μg/ml of mitomycin C and 1 mM IPTG for 3 
hours. Supernatants were filtered through 0.45 μm syringe filters (Acrodisc), concentrated 
with Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units (EMD Millipore) and resuspended in PBS. In 
order to generate phage stocks that were free of mitomycin C-induced DNA damage, 
logarithmic phase cultures of S. aureus RN4220 harboring the complementing plasmids 
pJW474, pJW383 and pJW278 were infected with the PBS phage stocks obtained from 
strains JW924, JW833 and JW563, respectively, at an MOI of 1 and treated with 1 mM 
IPTG. After 3 hours, final phage stocks were prepared by filtration of the supernatant.
qPCR
Total DNA was extracted from S. aureus cells using a modified phenol/chloroform/isoamyl 
alcohol (Fisher) protocol as described35. qPCR was performed using Fast SYBR Green 
Master Mix (Life Technologies) and 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied 
Biosystems) with primer pairs JW703/JW704 (ϕ12) and W915/W916 (S. aureus RN4220 
rho control). The sequences of the primers used in this study are listed in Extended Data 
Table 1.
Plaque formation assay
Plaque forming units (pfu) were counted on a layer of S. aureus cells suspended in 50% 
heart infusion agar (HIA) plated on a BHI agar base. Samples for measuring extracellular 
pfu were obtained by filtering culture supernatants through a 0.45 μm syringe filter. Samples

 for measuring intracellular pfu were obtained by spinning cells at 10,000 rpm for 1 minute, 
resuspending cell pellets in BHI supplemented with lysostaphin (167 μg/ml) and incubating 
the suspensions at 37°C for 5 minutes. Samples were stored on ice until all time points were 
taken. Finally, samples were briefly vortexed, spun at 10,000 rpm for 1 minute, and 10-fold 
dilutions were made from the supernatant.
Spacer library generation
Total phage DNA was extracted by a modified phenol/chloroform/isoamyl (PCI) alcohol 
extraction protocol. Phage were concentrated with Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units to 
~109 pfu/μl, and 100 μl of phage were digested with 10 μl (8 units) proteinase K (NEB) in 
the presence of 1X CutSmart buffer (NEB) in a total volume of 500 μl at 37°C for 3 hours. 
500 μl of PCI were added and the DNA extraction protocol was followed as described 
without bead beating35. 50 μg phage DNA was sonicated in a 130 μl total volume in 
microTUBE AFA Fiber Pre-Slit Snap-Cap 6×16mm tubes (Covaris) using the Covaris S220 
Focused-ultrasonicator to a fragment size of 150 bp. The sonicated DNA was dialyzed and 
50 μl (~20 μg) was transformed by electroporation into 50 μl of electro-competent S. aureus 
RN4220 cells carrying the pRH223 and pRH240 plasmids (L6308). L6308 cells were 
pretreated with 0.25 μg/ml anhydrotetracycline hydrochloride for 8 minutes prior to being 
made electro-competent to induce cas1, cas2 and csn2. Following electroporation, cells were 
outgrown in plain BHI at 37°C for 3 hours and CaCl2 was added for 20 minutes before 
infection with live phages.
CRISPR immunization simulation assay
After overnight inoculations in TSB supplemented with spectinomycin, S. aureus RN4220 
strains containing plasmids pJW465, pJW466 and pJW469 (“upstream targeting”) or 
plasmids pJW471, pJW476 and pJW477 (“downstream targeting”) were pooled in equal 
volumes. Each pool was mixed with S. aureus RN4220 cells at a ratio of 1:104 and 0.5 μl of 
this mix was added to 150 μl of TSB supplemented with calcium chloride in quadruplicate in 
a 96-well cell culture plate (Cellstar, 655180). Following 1 hour of shaking at 37°C in a 
microplate reader (TECAN Infinite® 200 PRO), ϕ12γ3 or ϕ12γ3cos-flip phages were added 
at an MOI of approximately 18. OD600 measurements were recorded every 10 minutes 
during further shaking at 37°C. Spectinomycin was added after 5 hours to maintain plasmid 
selection and to inhibit the growth of non-plasmid containing, phage-resistant, CRISPR-
independent cells.

(pink arrow and dotted line) in tandem into this phage about 2.5 kb upstream of the cos site 
generating ϕ12γ3chi-extra. CRISPR adaptation against this phage showed comparable levels 
of spacer acquisition for sequences mapping to the region between the cos site and the new 
chi sites. However, adaptation in the region to the left of the new chi sites, normally a highly 
adapted region, was reduced significantly. Abundance (RPMspc) of ϕ12γ3 (green) or 
ϕ12γ3chi-extra (pink) sequences incorporated as spacers into the CRISPR array 30 min after 
infection at MOI 10 is shown. e, Abundance (RPMϕ12) of ϕ12γ3 (red) or ϕ12γ3cos-flip (blue) 
sequences incorporated as spacers following a 30 minute infection of addAn cells at MOI 10. 
Despite the absence of chi sites pointing in the 3′-5′ direction, spacer acquisition from 
ϕ12γ3cos-flip is limited to the area immediately adjacent to the cos site, in contrast to that 
observed for wild-type cells in Fig. 2g. This suggests that addAn degradation increases the 
number of free DNA ends used as adaptation substrates and that the cos site serves as the 
main entry point for the adaptation machinery.

 S. pyogenes CRISPR-Cas system in the presence of aTc. This generated a library of cells 
containing a type II CRISPR-Cas system programmed with different spacers from the ϕ12γ3 
genome. c, After transformation, cells recovered for 3.3 hours in ATC-free media and were 
treated with live ϕ12γ3 phage for 15 minutes. The surviving bacteriophage-insensitive 
mutant (BIMs) colonies were counted by plating 100 μl of the infected culture. Bacteria 
transformed with a water control (−) yielded 9 cfu/100 μl, none of which had incorporated a 
new spacer (data not shown). This demonstrates that at least after 3.3 hours without the aTc 
inducer, staphylococci harboring the engineered CRISPR-Cas system cannot acquire new 
spacers during subsequent infection with live phage. This rules out new events of spacer 
acquisition during the infection of the library with ϕ12γ3 or ϕ12γ3cos-flip. Conversely, cells 
transformed with sonicated ϕ12γ3 DNA yielded 327 cfu/100 μl, and all of those tested (n=4) 
carried an expanded CRISPR array, indicating that significant adaptation occurred during the 
electroporation of ϕ12γ3 fragments. d, Analysis of spacer selection from the library after 
infection. The library of spacers was treated with ϕ12γ3 or ϕ12γ3cos-flip (not shown) at 
MOIs of 0, 10 or 100 for 24 hours to determine whether selection during phage interference 
could influence the spacer distribution within the library. Spacer acquisition in the 
uninfected library (MOI =0) could not be detected by PCR, indicating that the majority of 
cells in the library do not enlarge the CRISPR array with viral spacers during this period. In 
contrast, strong PCR products corresponding to expanded CRISPR loci were observed 
following the overnight phage infections, demonstrating the enrichment of adapted cells 
during CRISPR-Cas targeting, both at MOI 10 and 100. Incorporation of new spacers could 
not be detected by PCR in the control cells transformed with water, providing further 
evidence that in this assay cells are only able to adapt during electroporation in the presence 
of aTc, but not after this treatment, in the absence of the inducer. S1 and S0, CRISPR loci

 Extended Data Figure 9. Coordination between the immunization and targeting phases of the 
type II CRISPR-Cas immune response
Immunization occurs shortly after the beginning of the infection through the acquisition of 
new viral spacer sequences preferentially from the first injected free DNA end (green circle). 
Degradation of this DNA end by the AddAB nuclease, limited by chi sites, generates 
additional free DNA end substrates for recognition by the Cas1-Cas2-Cas9-Csn2 spacer 
acquisition complex and subsequent integration into the CRISPR array by the Cas1-Cas2 
integrase. During targeting, Cas9 nucleases loaded with the crRNA guides generated by the 
acquired spacers allow the majority of the cells of the immunized host population to target 
the first region to be injected (green; red, last injected region) by subsequent invading 
viruses, providing faster and more efficient immunity.

 Extended Data Figure 10. Pattern of spacer acquisition during ϕNM4γ4 infection
a, Packaging of cos phages. In phage lambda, and presumably in ϕ12, the packaging of the 
viral genome invariably starts by cleavage of the terminase complex (red arrowhead) at the 
cos site of the phage concatamer generated by rolling circle replication, located between 
hypothetical genes a and z. The DNA to the left of the cos site (z gene, green circle) is the 
last to be packaged into the phage capsid and therefore always the first to be injected into a 
newly infected bacterial cell. The expected pattern of spacer acquisition starts from this 
dsDNA end and progressively decreases until the first chi site (yellow gradient box). b, 
Pattern of spacer acquisition for ϕ12γ3 10 minutes after infection at an MOI of 10. This is 
similar to the results obtained at 30 minutes (Fig. 1c) but comparable to the infection 
conditions of panel d. The area highlighted with a yellow gradient shows the expected 
spacer acquisition pattern. cos, cohesive end; grey triangles, chi sites pointing in the 5′-3′ 
direction, with the dotted line marking the first chi site upstream of the cos site. c, Packaging 
of pac phages. These phages employ a “headful” DNA packaging mechanism in which each 
genomic concatamer is cleaved first at the pac site with subsequent cleavages occurring 
processively but imprecisely, after packaging about 105 % genome lengths. The exact 
percentage is determined by how much DNA can be filled into the phage capsid and it is 
always >100 % to ensure duplicated sequences at each end of the injected genome for 
recombination and circularization after infection of the next host. S. aureus pac phages and 
pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) display a rightward packaging mechanism where the 
duplicated DNA is located downstream of the next pac site. Therefore the last sequence to be 
packaged into the phage capsid and therefore the first to be injected into a newly infected 
bacterial cell is variable for each infection (a, b, c gene, green circles) but lies immediately 
downstream of the pac site. The expected pattern of spacer acquisition starts from every 
different dsDNA end and progressively decreases leftward until the first chi site (yellow

 gradient box). d, We determined the spacer acquisition pattern of the pac phage ϕNM4γ4 (a 
lytic derivative of ϕNM4, 10 minutes after infection at an MOI of 10. As expected for the 
injection of variable dsDNA ends downstream of the pac site, we detected a spacer 
acquisition hotspot in the 10–20 kb region to the right of this site (the expected pattern is 
highlighted in yellow). This is consistent with the rightward migration of pac phage injection 
points, with 10–20 kb corresponding to the packaging of about 5–10 viral genomes, well 
within observed ranges of pac phage processivity. cos, cohesive end; grey triangles, chi sites 
pointing in the 5′-3′ direction, with the dotted line marking the first chi site upstream of the 
cos site.
