Abstract
Background: Sinks in patient rooms are associated with hospital-acquired infections. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the effect of removal of sinks from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patient rooms and the introduction of
‘water-free’ patient care on gram-negative bacilli colonization rates.
Methods: We conducted a 2-year pre/post quasi-experimental study that compared monthly gram-negative bacilli
colonization rates pre- and post-intervention using segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series data.
Five ICUs of a tertiary care medical center were included. Participants were all patients of 18 years and older
admitted to our ICUs for at least 48 h who also received selective digestive tract decontamination during the
twelve month pre-intervention or the twelve month post-intervention period. The effect of sink removal and the
introduction of ‘water-free’ patient care on colonization rates with gram-negative bacilli was evaluated. The main
outcome of this study was the monthly colonization rate with gram-negative bacilli (GNB). Yeast colonization rates
were used as a ‘negative control’. In addition, colonization rates were calculated for first positive culture results from
cultures taken ≥3, ≥5, ≥7, ≥10 and ≥14 days after ICU-admission, rate ratios (RR) were calculated and differences
tested with chi-squared tests.
Results: In the pre-intervention period, 1496 patients (9153 admission days) and in the post-intervention period
1444 patients (9044 admission days) were included. Segmented regression analysis showed that the intervention
was followed by a statistically significant immediate reduction in GNB colonization in absence of a pre or post
intervention trend in GNB colonization. The overall GNB colonization rate dropped from 26.3 to 21.6 GNB/1000 ICU
admission days (colonization rate ratio 0.82; 95%CI 0.67–0.99; P = 0.02). The reduction in GNB colonization rate became
more pronounced in patients with a longer ICU-Length of Stay (LOS): from a 1.22-fold reduction (≥2 days), to a 1.6-fold
(≥5 days; P = 0.002), 2.5-fold (for ≥10 days; P < 0.001) to a 3.6-fold (≥14 days; P < 0.001) reduction.
Conclusions: Removal of sinks from patient rooms and introduction of a method of ‘water-free’ patient care is
associated with a significant reduction of patient colonization with GNB, especially in patients with a longer ICU
length of stay.

 Background
Hospital acquired infections in the Intensive Care Unit
(ICU) result in patient morbidity and mortality [1].
Environmental contamination in hospitals wards and
ICUs is a recognized problem for infection prevention
and control [2–7], as the environment may facilitate
transmission of several important health care-associated
pathogens, including gram-negative bacilli (GNB) [8]. As
part of the traditional hospital hand hygiene strategy and
patient care, sinks are present in virtually all hospital
wards and patient rooms. While sinks in the proximity
of patients are advocated as a best practice of ICU
design [9], involvement of these sinks in hospital-
associated infections have been reported as early as the
1970s [10–14]. Recent publications have highlighted the
role of sinks as a source of outbreaks and transmission
of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB)
in intensive care units, including paediatric and neonatal
ICUs [15–28]. Interventions to reduce transmission of
MDR-GNB from sinks in outbreak settings have been
explored [29–31], while the effect of sinks on overall
infection and colonization rates has not been studied.
As multi-drug resistance (MDR) in GNB is an increasing
problem in the management of hospitalized patients
[32–34], we investigated the effect of the removal of sinks
from the ICU patient rooms combined with ‘water-free’
patient care on ICU-acquired GNB colonization rates in
patients admitted to the ICU.
Methods
Background and study design
In early 2014 an outbreak with extended-spectrum β-lac-
tamase
(ESBL)-producing
Enterobacter
cloacae
was
identified in our ICU that could be related to contami-
nated sinks. When the decision to remove the sinks and
to implement the ‘water-free’ patient care method was
taken, it was prospectively decided to evaluate its effect
after 12 months. We conducted a pre/post quasi-experi-
mental study to evaluate the effect of sink removal and
introduction of ‘water-free’ patient care on colonization
with GNB in patients admitted to the ICU for at least
48 h during a 12-month pre-intervention (May 2013–
April 2014), the months of intervention (May 2014–
August 2014) and a 12-month post-intervention period
(September 2014–August 2015).
Study setting
This study was conducted in a large tertiary care medical
center in the Netherlands with 953 beds. The ICU con-
sists of five subunits, with a total 34 operational single
patient rooms. Patients admitted to the ICU that need
mechanical ventilation and are anticipated to stay >24 h
receive selective digestive tract decontamination (SDD),
which consists of 4 days of intravenous cefotaxime and
topical application of tobramycin, colistin, and ampho-
tericin B in the oropharynx and stomach [35]. No alter-
ations were made to the SDD protocol during the study
period. An essential part of SDD strategy is twice a week
routine screening for colonization with gram-negative
bacilli and yeasts from rectal, sputum and throat swabs.
The intervention
Between May and August 2014, all sinks were removed
from all ICU patient rooms and a ‘water-free’ method of
patient care was introduced, meaning that all patient
care related activities that take place in the patient room
and that would normally involve the use of tap water
were adapted to a ‘water-free’ alternative, see Table 1.
Patient selection and medical ethical aspects
All patients of 18 years and older who were admitted to
the ICU for at least 48 h were included in this study.
The study was reviewed and approved (File number
CMO: 2015–1764) by the ethics committee of the Rad-
boud university medical centre and was carried out in
accordance with the applicable rules concerning biomed-
ical research using patient information. Patient data were
collected and analyzed anonymously.
Data collection
Data were collected in a standardized manner according
to standard definitions and were subject to data quality
checks [36]. Demographic information including sex and
age, referring specialty and location before ICU admis-
sion, type of admission, comorbidity, Acute Physiology
and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) score, days
on mechanical ventilation, and ICU length of stay, were

 collected. We collected culture results (from routine SDD
screenings) from the medical microbiology laboratory
database. Culture results from cultures taken <48 h of
admission, including all repeat findings, were excluded
from further analyses. When a patient was readmitted to
the ICU during the study period, culture results identical
to the first ICU admission were excluded.
Outcomes and definitions
The primary outcome of this study was the GNB
colonization rate, calculated as the number of primary
positive microbiological results per 1000 ICU admission
days, during the pre- and post-intervention periods. The
colonization rates of patients with yeasts were used as a
‘negative control’
, as yeasts do not thrive in sinks and the
ICU sinks at all times had been free of yeast colonization.
Statistical analysis
‘To compare the patient characteristics between pre-
intervention and post-intervention period, we described
continuous data as mean ± standard deviation and
groups were compared using a Student-t-test, or as
median (25th and 75th percentile) and compared using a
Mann-Whitney U test, depending on the distribution.
Dichotomous or categorical data were described as num-
ber with percentage and subgroups were compared
using a Chi-squared test. The pre- and post-intervention
GNB and yeast colonization rates were calculated per
1000 admission days. The colonization rate ratios were
(with 95% confidence interval (CI)) calculated to quan-
tify the effect of the intervention on these rates. For
calculating the subsequent colonization rates related to
ICU- length of stay (LOS), only admissions of ≥3, ≥5,
≥7, ≥10 or ≥14 days were used for the denominator
(number of admission days).
Segmented regression analysis of interrupted time
series data was conducted to estimate the effect of the
intervention on the monthly GNB and yeast colonization
rates, both immediately and over time and to identify
whether there was a baseline or a post-intervention
monthly trend in colonization rate [37]. An autoregres-
sive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was
used. The model was adjusted for negative first order
autocorrelation by including an autocorrelation parameter
in the segmented regression model [37]. To determine if
colonization was likely to be ICU-acquired and to relate it
to exposure duration, time-dependent (ICU-LOS) effects
were investigated. In this ARIMA model, β0 estimates the
baseline level of the monthly colonization rate at time
zero; β1 estimates the pre-intervention or baseline linear
trend of the monthly colonization rate; β2 estimates the
level change in the monthly colonization rate immediately
after the intervention (i.e. step change or change in level:
immediate effect of the intervention); and β3 estimates the
post-intervention change in linear trend of the monthly
colonization rate. Predicted rates are calculated based on
model parameters. The rates during the intervention
months (May 2014 – August 2014) were excluded from
this analysis.
First, the full regression model was specified for the
GNB and the yeast colonization, meaning that the fol-
lowing estimates were given: β0, β1, β2, and β3. After
stepwise elimination of non-significant terms, the most
parsimonious model contained only the intercept (β0)
and the significant level change (β2) in the monthly
colonization rate. This segmented regression analysis
was performed on all GNB identified ≥2 days after ICU
admission, and subsequently repeated for GNB first
identified ≥3, ≥5, ≥7, ≥10 or ≥14 days after ICU admis-
sion, respectively.
If the segmented regression analysis would show that
there was no monthly trend in GNB colonization either
before or after the intervention, overall GNB colonization
rates were calculated and compared between pre- and
post-intervention and were defined as the number of
GNB (or MDR-GNB) per 1000 ICU admission days. The
rates during the intervention months (May 2014 – August
2014) were excluded from this analysis. Colonization rate
ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) were calculated to
quantify the effect of the intervention on the outcome and
rates were compared using a Chi-squared test. This ana-
lysis was repeated for GNB identified ≥3, ≥5, ≥7, ≥10 or
≥14 days after ICU admission, respectively.
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS
Statistics version 22 and STATA/SE version 11.0. A two-
sided p-value <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical
significance.
Results
An increased number of Enterobacter cloacae ESBL
positive isolates was detected and communicated to the
ICU in May 2014. In total 11 isolates pre and one isolate
post-intervention were identified. By molecular typing
we were able to show that 5 isolates were related pre-
intervention. Sinks in the ICU were tested positive for
Enterobacter cloacae ESBL prior to removal. The out-
break developed despite routine use of extensive infec-
tion prevention measures including the use of protective
clothing and gloves with all patient contacts. It was
decided to remove the sinks from all ICU patient rooms
in order to eradicate the source of MDR-GNB in the dir-
ect patient environment.
1644 patients were admitted to the ICU in the
12 months prior to the removal of sinks from the ICU
patient rooms, of which 1496 patients had a ICU-LOS
≥2 days (total 9153 admission days). In the 12 months
after the removal of sinks, 1618 patients were admitted
to the ICU, of which 1444 were in the ICU for ≥2 days

 (total 9044 admission days). 145 (9.7%) in the pre-
intervention period and 137 (9.5%) post-intervention
were re-admissions (P = 0.85). See Fig. 1.
The
baseline
demographic
characteristics
of
the
patients at ICU admission are described in Table 2.
Apart from a statistically significant difference between
pre- and post-intervention patients for chronic respira-
tory insufficiency as a comorbidity, no other relevant dif-
ferences in demographics were observed. The median
ICU-length of stay was 3 days (IQR 2–6 days) pre-
intervention, and 3 days (IQR 2–6 days) post-intervention
(p = 0.90). In the pre- and post-intervention periods,
31.2% and 30.5% (P = 0.66) had an ICU-LOS ≥5 days, and
15.6% and 16.1% (P = 0.71) had an ICU-LOS ≥ 10 days,
respectively. Over a third of the ICU admissions (38.3%
pre-intervention; 34.9% post-intervention; P = 0.06) had a
type of registered comorbidity at admission. A statistically
significant difference between pre- and post-intervention
patients (7.8% vs 4.9%, respectively; P = 0.002) was
observed for chronic respiratory insufficiency.
Interrupted time series analysis
The results of the segmented regression analysis are
shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. There was a statisti-
cally significant immediate effect of the removal of sinks
on the monthly colonization rate of GNB, but not on
the colonization rate of yeasts, with statistically significant
β2 level changes for all GNB colonization outcomes for
the different ICU LOS (P = 0.037 for ICU LOS ≥48 h,
P = 0.005 for ICU LOS ≥3 days; P = 0.001 for ICU LOS
≥5 days; P < 0.001 for ICU LOS ≥7 days; P = 0.005 for
ICU LOS ≥10 days; P = 0.011 for ICU LOS ≥14 days) .
There was no pre-intervention drift in monthly GNB rates
and this was also the case in the ICU-LOS-dependent
analyses.

with
the
observed
and
predicted
colonization rates are shown in Fig. 2. The data for the
interrupted time series analysis for yeast colonization are
shown in Additional file 2: Figure S4.
In the most parsimonious model, the pre-intervention
trend (β1) and post-intervention trend-change (β3) were
omitted, resulting in a statistically significant immediate
effect of the intervention on the GNB colonization rates.
Overall GNB colonization rates
The overall GNB colonization rates were 26.3 and 21.6
GNB/1000 ICU admission days (rate ratio 0.82; 95%CI
0.67–0.99; P = 0.02) for pre- and post-intervention groups,
respectively. The difference between the groups became
more pronounced over time: GNB colonization rates that
were first identified in cultures taken ≥3 days (22.5 vs. 15.2;
RR 0.68; 95%CI 0.53–0.86; P < 0.001), cultures taken

Discussion
We have shown that the removal of sinks in patient rooms
and implementation of water-free patient care is associ-
ated with a significant reduction of patient colonization
with GNB and this effect was most pronounced in
patients with a longer ICU length of stay.
The effect of the intervention on GNB colonization
rates became even more apparent when pathogens that
were first identified after longer durations of ICU stay
were compared between the pre-intervention and post-
Fig. 2 Monthly gram-negative bacilli (GNB) colonization rates. Legend: Monthly GNB colonization rates (bars), the predicated rate based on the
full model (grey line) and the predicted rate based on the parsimonious model (black line). β2 level change p-values are shown in 2A to 2F, where
β2 stands for the level change in the monthly colonization rate immediately after the intervention. Section A to F refer to GNB identified in ICU
patients with a length of stay of ≥2, ≥3, ≥5, ≥7, ≥10 or ≥14 days after ICU admission

 intervention period. Apart from the fact that with
increased ICU-LOS the likelihood increases that these
pathogens were acquired at the ICU, it appears plausible
that a longer stay in an ICU increases the exposure to
potential pathogens in the direct patient surroundings
including those originated from the sinks.
The lower number GNB in the post-intervention
period cannot be explained by an overall decrease in
observed pathogens, as there was no effect of the inter-
vention on yeast colonization rates. Yeast do not thrive
in sinks or siphons and therefore we used them as a
negative control. Furthermore, the overall number of
cultures processed in the pre- and post-intervention
study period were similar meaning that there was no
reduction in the total number of screening cultures
taken that could explain our findings.
In this study, we focused on colonization rates, and
not infections. Even though infections caused by GNB
would have been a more relevant clinical outcome than
colonization, demonstrating the effect of an intervention
on clinical infection rate would require a sample size
that is not feasible. Previous work on the effects of SDD
on infections with gram-negative bacilli showed that the
cumulative incidence of ICU-acquired bacteremia in the
SDD study group was 0.9%. To demonstrate a 30%
reduction related to this intervention, approximately
26,000 patients would need to be included. Nevertheless,
as colonization precedes infection, it is plausible that
the intervention will have an impact on bloodstream
infections with GNB.
Limitations of the study
Several limitations of this study need to be addressed.
First and most importantly, this is an open label,
non-randomized
single-centre
study.
Naturally,
the
implementation procedures importantly limited the
feasibility of using other study designs. Despite of the
design limitations, in the absence of alternative expla-
nations, we believe that it is conceivable that the
removal of sinks and implementation of water-free
patient care resulted in a significant reduction of
GNB colonization. There was no pre-existing down-
ward drift in colonization rate, no changes were made
during the study period in the hand hygiene protocol,
protocol of standard or transmission-based precau-
tions and the protocols of cleaning and disinfection.
No chlorhexidine gluconate bathing is performed in
our ICU. The quality of cleaning and disinfection
remained constant and antibiotic guidelines did not
alter during the study. The only difference between
the pre- and post-intervention periods were the differ-
ences in some of the baseline demographic character-
istics, e.g., patients in the pre-intervention period
more often suffered chronic respiratory insufficiency
compared to post-intervention admissions. However, as
the vast majority (87%) of GNB colonization was identi-
fied in patients without chronic respiratory insufficiency,
it appears unlikely that this difference could account for
the observed effects. Importantly, no relevant changes in
procedures, staffing levels, technical infrastructure, or
other major changes that could influence patient manage-
ment took place during the conduct of the study. No alter-
native confounders could be identified that could have
influenced the outcome of the study. Second, our inter-
vention was performed in a relatively “low GNB endemic
setting” due to the use of SDD [35]. It is difficult to predict
how the findings of this study can be generalized to a
broader setting including non-SDD hospitals. On ICU’s
with a higher GNB colonization rate compared to our set-
ting, it appears plausible that the effects could be more
pronounced. Removing sinks from patient rooms could be
a very effective intervention with a high impact for ICUs
in low-resource settings, where nosocomial infections with
GNB are very common [38]. Some may argue that the
removal of the sinks could interfere with the prevention of
nosocomial transmission of Clostridium difficile, as spores
are resistant to alcohol-based handrub. In our hospital the
incidence of Clostridium difficile infections is very low.
Over the last 2.5 years 4 patients were diagnosed with
Clostridium difficile in the ICU. Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention advises to wear gloves when caring for
patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhea. After gloves
are removed, hands should be washed with a non-anti-
microbial or an antimicrobial soap and water or disin-
fected with an alcohol-based handrub [39]. Our ICU
setting with use of gloves in all patient contacts is in line
with these recommendations. In our ICU, we have pur-
chased a mobile hand washing sink that can be used as a
back-up in case of a serious Clostridium infection outbreak.

 In view of our results we should reconsider the neces-
sity of sinks and other ‘wet’ areas in the patient rooms.
Under time constraints, healthcare workers compliance
with infection prevention and control measures is often
reduced, specifically in the case of hand hygiene, infec-
tion prevention protocols and waste management proto-
cols. Reconstructing the hospital infrastructure in a way
that behavior of healthcare workers is more directed
towards good clinical practice is a step in the direction
of sustainable infection control.

This study shows that removal of the sinks from all
patient rooms and the
introduction of
‘water-free’
patient care is associated with a statistically significant
lower number of ICU patients that become colonized
with
GNB,
including
MDR-GNB,
especially
among
patients with a longer length of stay at the ICU. To our
knowledge, this is the first study that indicates that sinks
in patient rooms not only play a role in outbreak situa-
tions, but also in sporadic transmission of GNB from
sinks to patients.
