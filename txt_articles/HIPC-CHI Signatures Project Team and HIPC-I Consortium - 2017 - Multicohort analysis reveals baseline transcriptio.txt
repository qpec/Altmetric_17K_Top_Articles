Multicohort analysis reveals baseline transcriptional 
predictors of influenza vaccination responses
HIPC-CHI Signatures Project Team* and HIPC-I Consortium†
Annual influenza vaccinations are currently recommended for all individuals 6 months and older. Antibodies in-
duced by vaccination are an important mechanism of protection against infection. Despite the overall public health 
success of influenza vaccination, many individuals fail to induce a substantial antibody response. Systems-level 
immune profiling studies have discerned associations between transcriptional and cell subset signatures with 
the success of antibody responses. However, existing signatures have relied on small cohorts and have not been 
validated in large independent studies. We leveraged multiple influenza vaccination cohorts spanning distinct 
geographical locations and seasons from the Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) and the Center 
for Human Immunology (CHI) to identify baseline (i.e., before vaccination) predictive transcriptional signatures of 
influenza vaccination responses. Our multicohort analysis of HIPC data identified nine genes (RAB24, GRB2, DPP3, 
ACTB, MVP, DPP7, ARPC4, PLEKHB2, and ARRB1) and three gene modules that were significantly associated with 
the magnitude of the antibody response, and these associations were validated in the independent CHI cohort. 
These signatures were specific to young individuals, suggesting that distinct mechanisms underlie the lower vac-
cine response in older individuals. We found an inverse correlation between the effect size of signatures in young 
and older individuals. Although the presence of an inflammatory gene signature, for example, was associated with 
better antibody responses in young individuals, it was associated with worse responses in older individuals. These 
results point to the prospect of predicting antibody responses before vaccination and provide insights into the 
biological mechanisms underlying successful vaccination responses.
INTRODUCTION
Influenza infection is a serious global public health concern. Vaccina­
tion is currently the best available tool for protecting against infec­
tion. However, current estimates indicate that the vaccine is only 51% 
to 67% effective in adults under age 65 (1). This efficacy is further 
reduced in older adults who are 20% less likely to seroconvert than 
young adults and often fail to generate neutralizing antibodies that 
are critical to protection (2). A number of demographic factors have 
been associated with differential vaccination response, including age, 
gender, and smoking (3, 4). Furthermore, gene expression patterns 
can display different temporal patterns in young and older individuals 
(5), as well as in males and females after vaccination (4, 6). In addi­
tion, immune “states” can be highly variable across individuals (7). For 
instance, although some immune variables have strong genetic deter­
minants (8, 9), many can be environmentally determined (10). Despite 
their substantial influence, preexisting molecular and cellular factors 
tend to account for a relatively modest fraction of the response vari­
ability (11). Reliable predictors involving a limited number of genes 
could provide useful information at the point of care to modify vacci­
nation strategies or provide counseling on increased risk. Further, 
these signatures could provide insights into the underlying biological 
mechanisms that influence the immune response to vaccination and 
thus may offer clues on novel vaccine candidates and previously un­
known vaccination strategies.
A number of systems biology studies have proposed gene expres­
sion and cellular signatures that are correlated with early vaccination 
response (7, 12–16). However, all but one (13) analyzed relatively 
small cohorts from single influenza seasons and geographic locations. 
Thus, these studies are not sufficiently powered to account for the 
substantial heterogeneity observed in the world, and their findings 
have yet to be validated in independent cohorts. Despite a number of 
systems biology studies on vaccination, only one study has found base­
 
 
line predictive signatures that were based on immune cell frequencies 
after interrogating a large number of variables, including peripheral 
blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression (7), and baseline gene 
expression signatures were not predictive and thus remain elusive.
Here, we leveraged six influenza vaccination cohorts spanning 
distinct geographical locations and vaccination seasons from the 
Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) and the Center 
for Human Immunology (CHI) (a National Institutes of Health intra­
mural affiliate of HIPC) to conduct a multicenter analysis to identify 
baseline transcriptional signatures predictive of influenza vaccina­
tion responses. We took advantage of transcriptional profiling and 
antibody titer measurements across cohorts in HIPC and applied a 
common quantitative metric to stratify relative vaccine responses in 
all cohorts (7). We applied a recently developed framework designed for 
integrated, multicohort analysis of existing data sets. The framework 
has been shown to be successful in identifying robust and reproducible 
gene signatures by leveraging biological and technical heterogeneity 
present in those data sets (17) and has been successfully applied to a broad 
range of diseases including cancer (18, 19), organ transplants (20), 
and infectious diseases (4, 21–23). We applied this framework to four 
of our cohorts and successfully identified baseline gene expression 
signatures associated with responses. In addition, we used the Quan­
titative Set Analysis for Gene Expression (QuSAGE) (24) gene set 
analysis framework to identify baseline gene modules robustly as­
sociated with vaccination responses. We validated both the gene ex­
pression and module­based signatures in an independent cohort from 
a distinct geographic location (Fig. 1). These validated signatures were 
specific to young participants (below 35 years), and their effect sizes 
(strength of correlation with antibody responses) were inversely cor­
related in young and older participants.

RESULTS
We selected four large cohorts that each included both young and 
older adults as discovery cohorts to identify robust baseline (i.e., 
immediately before vaccination) gene expression signatures of in­
fluenza vaccination responses (see Fig. 2 and Methods for details). 
The age distribution within each cohort was bimodal (Fig. 2A), with 
participants either below the age of 35 or above 60 years. Before 
initiating this study, we further selected two independent validation 
cohorts for testing any signatures derived from the discovery co­
horts (Fig. 2). Together, these studies include >500 individuals from 
four independent institutions within the United States across five 
consecutive vaccination seasons beginning in 2008–2009 (Fig. 2B). 
Basic demographic data were available for all of these individuals, 
along with pre­ and postvaccination antibody titers from ImmPort 
and ImmuneSpace. In addition, genome­wide transcriptional profil­
ing data were available from blood samples taken immediately before 
vaccination in a subset of 275 individuals.
Categorization of individual influenza  
vaccination responses
Vaccination responses were quantified for each individual within 
each cohort using the “adjusted maximum fold change” (adjMFC) 
metric (7, 11). This metric reflects the vaccination­induced increase 
in antibody titers adjusted for differences in the prevaccination titers 
and was adopted as the primary end point because this measure (i) 
mitigates the effect of prevaccination serology on the predictive sig­
natures given that baseline titers tend to correlate negatively with 
the fold change in titers after vaccination (Fig. 3A) (11), (ii) uses the 
maximum response across all viral strains given that none of the 
gene expression measurements we assessed reflected specificity to 
any of the individual influenza strains in the vaccine, and (iii) reflects 
the relative response among individuals instead of treating the titer 
values and their fold changes as absolute measurements and thus can 
potentially mitigate the effect of noise in titer measurements (25). 
Further details about the adjMFC calculation can be found in Methods 
and in (7, 11).
Given the bimodal age distribution across the discovery cohorts 
(Fig. 2A) and the previously published observation that both the 
antibody and transcriptional responses to vaccination have strong 
age dependencies (5, 26), we opted to divide each of the cohorts into 
young (35 years and below) and older (60 years and above) groups 
and analyzed them separately. This approach allowed us to uncover 
signatures beyond those driven by age, which was the focus of the 
original studies, as well as other existing studies (3, 5, 14). It allowed 
us to compare response signatures in young versus older adult par­
ticipants, which is an important issue that has been largely unexplored. 
We thus computed the adjMFC metric separately for each of the 
young and older adult fractions within each cohort. As expected, the 
adjMFC metric was uncorrelated with the prevaccination antibody 
titers (Fig. 3B). Following Tsang et al. (7), the participants were then 
stratified into “low,” “moderate,” and “high” responder classes based 
on the percentile of each participant’s adjMFC value (see Methods). 
Thus, this discretized, relative response measure delineates lower re­
sponders versus higher responders, as opposed to the absolute sero­
conversion status based on a fold change cutoff (i.e., “nonresponders” 
versus “responders”). In total, the discovery cohorts contained 66 low, 
53 moderate, and 57 high responders where transcriptional profil­
ing data were also available for signature identification (fig. S1).
Identification of baseline gene and module signatures
To identify individual genes for which baseline expression levels were 
associated with influenza vaccination responses, we compared high 
responders with low responders in the discovery cohorts. We used 
a previously described computational framework for integrated multi­
cohort analysis of gene expression profiles (4, 19, 20, 23) to analyze 
32,034 total gene symbols measured across the discovery cohorts. 
The analysis of young adults identified nine genes (RAB24, GRB2, 
DPP3, ACTB, MVP, DPP7, ARPC4, PLEKHB2, and ARRB1) with 
significantly increased expression and six genes (PTPN22, PURA, SP4, 
CASP6, NUDCD2, and PPIB) with significantly reduced expression in 
high responders at a false discovery rate (FDR) of <10% (Fig. 4). Only 
one of these genes identified by the meta­analysis would have been 
identified using a single cohort (RAB24 in SDY212, FDR < 10%), which 
demonstrates the power of multicohort analysis in leveraging evi­
dence across multiple studies to identify robust, differentially ex­
pressed genes. We observed similar trends for these 15 genes when 
comparing moderate responders versus low responders, although 
only PTPN22 reached statistical significance (fig. S2). No significant 
heterogeneity among studies was observed for any of these genes 
(P = 0.3 by Cochran’s Q). Among older adults, there were no genes 
that were significantly different between low and high responders, 
even considering a more lenient FDR of 20%. Despite the fact that 
gender differences are known to affect vaccine responses (3, 4, 6),

we observed no significant gender association with these signature 
genes at baseline (P = 0.56). To assess the ability of these genes to 
predict the vaccination response of individuals, we defined a “response 
score” as the geometric mean of the nine genes with increased ex­
pression in high responders, similar to previous analyses (4, 19, 20). 
This score distinguished low and high responders with high accuracy 
in the discovery cohorts [area under the curve (AUC) = 83 to 100% 
for young adults, mean AUC = 92%, fig. S3A]. Furthermore, the re­
sponse score was significantly correlated with adjMFC in the discovery 
cohorts (R = 0.55, P = 1.63 × 10−54). In contrast, an analogous response 
score calculated using only the genes with decreased expression in 
high responders had lower classification accuracy in the discovery 
cohorts (AUC = 80 to 96% for young adults, mean AUC = 87%, fig. 
S3B). Therefore, we chose to use only the overexpressed genes as our 
response score for validation. Overall, this analysis identified a small 
gene expression signature for which the prevaccination level was pre­
dictive of the vaccine­induced antibody response for younger adults.
We next sought to identify gene modules associated with the 
vaccination response using QuSAGE (24) on the discovery cohorts. 
QuSAGE quantifies gene module activity with a complete probability 
density function (PDF) and was designed to detect the perturbation 
of gene modules (i.e., coordinated, but potentially small, changes in 
sets of related genes). QuSAGE was originally designed to operate 
on a single study. To estimate a combined gene module activity for 
the four discovery cohorts, the QuSAGE PDFs computed for each 
data set were combined into one PDF for each gene module using 
numerical convolution (see Methods). QuSAGE analysis on blood 
transcription modules (BTMs) (27) identified 11 gene modules in 
young individuals that were significantly different between low and 
high responders (FDR ≤ 30% and P ≤ 0.01) (Fig. 5 and Table 1), in­
cluding B cell receptor (BCR) signaling (M54) and the inflammatory 
response (M33). An equivalent analysis in older individuals did not 
detect any significant gene modules (FDR ≤ 30% and P ≤ 0.01). Even 
with the use of much less stringent criteria (FDR ≤ 50% and P ≤ 0.01), 
only two gene modules could be detected for older individuals (table S2). 
Overall, this analysis identified several gene 
modules for which activities before vac­
cination were associated with altered vac­
cination responses.
Baseline signatures can  
predict vaccination response in 
young adults
To validate the gene and module signa­
tures identified in the discovery cohorts, 
we tested them in independent cohorts. 
At the time this study was initiated, no 
additional large cohorts that included both 
young and older adults were available. 
Thus, we validated the young and older 
signatures using two different cohorts with 
comparable age distributions: Predictions 
based on the young discovery cohort were 
validated in SDY80, whereas predictions 
from the older discovery cohort were 
validated in SDY67.
Validation was carried out for the nine 
individual genes in young adults with sig­
nificantly increased expression in high 
vaccine responders in the discovery cohorts. Because two genes 
(RAB24 and DPP3) were not measured in SDY80, the response score 
for validation in this case was composed of seven genes (GRB2, 
ACTB, MVP, DPP7, ARPC4, PLEKHB2, and ARRB1). Even with the 
use of this reduced signature, the response score showed a signifi­
cant trend of increasing values when comparing low, moderate, and 
high responders (Fig. 6A, P = 0.02 using Jonckheere­Terpstra trend 
test) and was significantly correlated with the adjMFC in SDY80 (R = 
0.44, P = 0.016). Further, the response score effectively distinguished 
low and high responders with high accuracy (AUC = 79%, P = 0.02 
Fig. 6B). Low and moderate antibody responders could also be dis­
tinguished but with lower accuracy (AUC = 74%, P = 0.10; Fig. 6B), 
which is noteworthy because moderate responders were not included 
in the signature identification from the discovery cohort. However, 
high and moderate responders could not be distinguished (AUC = 
62%, P = 0.27). Furthermore, four genes from the response signa­
ture were individually significantly more highly expressed when com­
paring high responders versus low responders in the validation 
cohort (GRB2, P = 0.036; ACTB, P = 0.002; MVP, P = 0.09; DPP7, 
P = 0.651; ARPC4, P = 0.031; PLEKHB2, P = 0.154; ARRB1, P = 
0.027). In addition to the baseline time point (taken immediately 
before vaccination), the validation study included several additional 
time points where transcriptional profiling was carried out, including 
7 days before vaccination, as well as 1, 7, and 70 days after vaccina­
tion. Consistent with the baseline analysis, we found a marginally sig­
nificant difference in the response scores between low and high responders 
1 week before vaccination (P = 0.06) and a significant difference at 
70 days after vaccination (P = 0.05). However, the vaccination re­
sponse appeared to transiently modulate these signature genes. We 
observed a significant increase in the response score when compar­
ing baseline to day 1 after vaccination (Fig. 6C, P = 0.01), and there 
was no significant difference between low and high responders at 
day 1 or 7 after vaccination (day 1, P = 0.21; day 7, P = 0.37). No 
significant genes were identified in older adults in the discovery co­
horts; thus, no additional validation of individual genes was carried

out. Overall, these results identify a prevaccination gene expression 
signature in young adults predictive of the antibody response. This 
signature was also modulated by vaccination as evidenced by signif­
icant changes after vaccination.
We also carried out a validation of the gene module signatures 
identified in the discovery cohorts. Of the 11 gene modules associ­
ated with vaccination response in young adults, 3 were also signifi­
cant in the validation cohort (FDR ≤ 10%). These included BCR 
signaling (M54) (Fig. 7), platelet activation (III) (M42) (fig. S4), and 
inflammatory response (M33) (fig. S5). Gene module activity of all 
three gene modules was higher in high responders in both the com­
bined discovery and validation cohorts. If we included an additional 
restriction of P ≤ 0.01 (as was used in the discovery cohort analysis), 
then only two modules, BCR signaling (M54) and platelet activation 
(III) (M42), were significant. We observed that the individual genes 
within these signature modules tended to display a consistent pattern of 
association with vaccination response in each of the cohorts (Fig. 5B). 
Like the case for the individual gene signature, the gene modules were 
significantly different between low and high responders at most time 
points in the validation cohort (Fig. 7C and figs. 4C and 5C). This 
included both baseline and day 70 after vaccination for all three mod­
ules, suggesting that they were temporally stable over a course of more 
than 2 months. However, the vaccination response appeared to tran­
siently modulate some of these modules. We observed significant 
increases in the activity of the inflammatory response (M33) and plate­
let activation (III) (M42) and a significant decrease in the activity of 
BCR signaling (M54), when comparing baseline to day 1 after vacci­
nation (fig. S5C). Neither of the two gene modules identified in older 
adults was associated with vaccination response in the older valida­
tion cohort (table S2). These results show that there exist temporally 
stable, prevaccination states of the immune system that are significantly 
associated with the antibody response in young participants (7).
These analyses used the set of BTMs that are based on correlated 
expression patterns identified in diverse public data sets (27). To de­
termine whether the biological functions implied by these modules 
were robustly correlated with vaccination response, we identified related 
modules from other sources. Specifically, we identified 24 modules 
related to inflammation, B cells or platelets from the Kyoto Ency­
clopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (28), Reactome (29), and 
the modules used in Obermoser et al. (16) (table S3). In support of the 
BTM analysis, we found that 13 of these modules were significantly 
different between high and low responders in a QuSAGE meta­ 
analysis 
including both the discovery and validation cohorts (FDR ≤ 5%). Most 
of the modules that were not significantly different were related to plate­
lets, and the identification of this module (M42) in the BTM analysis 
(Table 1) may have been due to its high overlap with the BCR signal­
ing (M54) module (5 of the 10 genes in M42 overlap with M54 in the 
BTM definition). These results implicate the prevaccination status of 
B cell signaling and inflammation as important indicators of immune 
state that influence the vaccination response.
Baseline signatures remain predictive after correcting for 
major cell subset frequencies
The transcriptional profiling data used to identify these signatures 
were obtained from PBMCs or whole blood and thus can reflect both 
changes in cell subset proportions, as well as differences in gene ex­
pression state (30, 31). To test whether the signatures we found were 
simply capturing differences in cell subset frequencies, we used re­
gression to adjust the young validation cohort data for variation 
in major cell subset proportions (B cells, monocytes, and CD4 and 
CD8 T cells measured by flow cytometry) that were measured on the 
same samples (see Methods). Although classification performance 
was decreased after this adjustment (high versus low AUC = 68%, 
moderate versus low AUC = 75%), the gene expression signature 
retained modest predictive power, suggesting that the performance 
cannot be attributed solely to differences in cell subset composition (fig. 
S6, A and B). The response score calculated on the adjusted data was not 
correlated with the nonadjusted data (r = −0.02). Inspection of the 
individual genes composing the response score showed that the predic­
tive signal was almost entirely due to ACTB in the adjusted data. Two 
of the gene modules [BCR signaling (M54) and platelet activation (III) 
(M42)] also remained significant after correcting for major cell subset 
frequencies (with similar P values to the nonadjusted analysis), whereas 
the P value for the inflammatory response (M33) module increased 
from 0.02 to 0.11. Overall, these results suggest that the signatures

of major cell subset variation.
Inverse correlation between young and older individuals
Because our analysis of the vaccination response in older adults failed 
to identify any prevaccination signature that could be validated in 
an independent cohort, we sought to determine how the signature 
genes and modules identified in young individuals behaved in older 
adults. To do this, we correlated signature gene and module effect 
sizes between young and older individuals across all discovery co­
horts and found that they generally exhibited opposite trends in these 
two age groups (Fig. 8). For instance, although the expression of the 
nine signature genes was significantly increased in high vaccine re­
sponders among young adults, their expression was decreased in high 
vaccine responders among older adults (Fig. 8A). A similar pattern 
was observed for signature gene modules (Fig. 8B). To determine 
whether this inverse relationship was restricted only to the signatures, 
we determined the individual gene and module effect sizes for all mea­
sured genes and BTMs. We observed a strong negative correlation 
between the effect sizes in young and older adults for both the individual

genes (R = −0.28 and P = 2.2 × 10−16) and the modules (R = −0.65 
and P = 2.2 × 10−16). This negative correlation was observed both 
for the summary effect sizes (calculated across the discovery cohorts, 
Fig. 8) and for the effect sizes in multiple individual discovery co­
horts. These observations suggest that immune states that are good for 
the vaccination response in young individuals may actually be detri­
mental to the response in older individuals.
DISCUSSION
The move toward precision medicine has underscored the impor­
tance of understanding whether and how information on an indi­
vidual’s immune states can help predict disease progression and treatment 
outcomes (11, 32). Influenza vaccination provides a model pertur­
bation to study this issue in the context of assessing immune response 
quality. Healthy individuals given the influenza vaccine exhibit a wide 
variation in the extent of the induced antibody response. We identi­
fied and validated baseline (i.e., before vaccination) gene and module­ 
based signatures that are associated with the vaccine­induced anti­
body response.
Signature validation using independent cohorts is critical, because 
genes associated with an outcome in one study may fail to be signifi­
cantly associated with that same outcome 
in other studies. This lack of reproduc­
ibility may have several underlying causes. 
First, if the studies involve a small num­
ber of individuals or geographic sites, 
then random fluctuations or confound­
ing factors may lead to spurious associ­
ations. Second, when large numbers of 
potential predictors are tested (e.g., the 
expression of every gene in the genome), 
a failure to properly account for statis­
tical issues involved in multiple testing 
and overfitting may lead to poor speci­
ficity. Last, it is well­known that experi­
mental measurements are subject to batch 
effects (33), and failure to account for 
these differences may hinder compari­
sons across studies. Although multiple 
studies have suggested postvaccination 
transcriptional signatures that are asso­
ciated with titer responses to influenza 
vaccination (5, 12, 15, 34, 35), only a 
few have identified baseline signatures 
that are significantly associated with the 
antibody response (3, 7, 13, 14), and 
none of these baseline signatures were 
found and then further validated using 
independent cohorts. Furman et al. (14) 
analyzed a cohort of 91 individuals 
(SDY212) and identified an age­ and 
apoptosis­related gene module that was 
correlated with the hemagglutination 
inhibition assay (HAI) response. In 
a separate study of the same cohort, 
Furman et al. (3) identified a gene mod­
ule enriched for lipid biosynthesis (also 
containing many genes modulated by 
testosterone) that was associated with sex and testosterone­dependent 
differences in the antibody response. Nakaya et al. (13) identified 
several gene modules for which expression was correlated with anti­
body response in multiple cohorts, but this result has not yet been 
validated in independent cohorts. Tsang et al. (7) found that base­
line transcripts robustly correlated with antibody responses were 
enriched for functions such as pattern recognition and interferon sig­
naling, but baseline predictive models (as assessed by cross­validation 
analysis of the same cohort, SDY80) involving transcripts alone could 
not be built. Instead, they were able to build machine­learning models 
predictive of the antibody response (as reflected by the adjMFC metric) 
independent of age and gender by using the frequency of a few tem­
porally stable cell populations from the baseline. Thus, our current 
study is distinct in identifying baseline transcriptional signatures asso­
ciated with antibody responses after influenza vaccination in young 
adults and subsequently validating these signatures using an inde­
pendent cohort.
In the analysis presented here, we attempted to identify robust 
signatures through several means. First, the six studies (four discovery 
and two validation) used were highly diverse and heterogeneous. They 
included data from multiple geographic areas (including California, 
Connecticut, Maryland, and Minnesota) using vaccines from different

effect sizes we detected in individual cohorts were high, they were not 
statistically significant in any of the discovery cohorts due to high vari­
ance among participants within individual cohorts. Hence, despite 
their high effect size, these genes (with the exception of RAB24 in 
SDY212) would not have been found without integration of data across 
multiple independent cohorts. Overall, our analysis revealed tem­
porally stable baseline signatures both at the gene expression and at 
the module level, as was observed in previously identified baseline 
predictive signatures involving peripheral immune cell subset fre­
quencies (7). Such stable signatures are particularly attractive bio­
markers for potential clinical use because they are robust to the timing 
of measurement and potentially reflect the inherent biological state 
of individuals (11).
In addition to recapitulating many known findings, the signatures 
identified by our analysis revealed the involvement of previously un­
reported genes and pathways. RAB24 is a small Ras­like guanosine 
triphosphatase that regulates protein trafficking and mediates auto­
phagy (36). Autophagy is important for antiviral innate immunity, 
antigen presentation, and cytokine secretion. Although not directly 
implicated in viral responses, the RAB family of proteins has been 
extensively studied in the context of trafficking in immune cells, 
especially dendritic cells and macrophages (37). GRB2 is an adaptor 
protein with involvement in BCR signaling (38, 39). It has been impli­
cated in mediating viral entry in retroviruses (40) and has also been 
associated with chronic leukemia, breast cancer, and Wiskott­Aldrich 
syndrome, a condition characterized by severe immunodeficiency 
and inability to clot (41). DPP3 is a metallopeptidase that is essential 
for the intracellular replication of the influenza virus and inhibits 
proapoptotic genes while promoting inflammation (42). The role of 
DPP3 in inflammation is consistent with our implication of the in­
flammatory response module in the vaccination response. Previous 
studies have also suggested the involvement of proapoptotic (14) and 
inflammation­related (13) genes with vaccine response but with an 
inverse relationship to that found here. It is possible that this discrepancy

is caused by the inclusion of older patients in these previous studies, 
which we have shown to be inversely correlated with younger partic­
ipants at the gene level. DPP3 is expressed in many types of immune 
cells, although its function in these contexts has not been described 
in detail (43, 44). In neutrophils, it may be involved in regulating inflam­
mation in peripheral tissue (45). DPP7, another member of the metallo­
peptidase family of DPP3 (46), has been shown to exhibit similar 
anti­apoptotic functions in lymphocytes (47). ACTB, the gene encod­
ing for ­actin, is a pivotal component of the cell cytoskeleton and is 
necessary for viral cell interactions and endocytosis across many 
different types of viruses (48–51). ARPC4 is a subunit of the human 
Arp2/3 complex, which is responsible for actin polymerization (52) 
and further supports the role of ­actin in promoting response to 
vaccine. Increased levels of these actin­associated genes can affect cell 
motility and may help promote antigen presentation in response to 
the vaccine. ARRB1 is a member of the arrestin/­arrestin protein 
family expressed at high levels in peripheral blood leukocytes and im­
plicated in regulating receptor­mediated immunological activity 
(53). It is also an essential gene for Marburg virus infection (54) and 
is further involved in dendritic cell activation and maturation in re­
sponse to HIV virus­like particles (55). PLEKHB2 is involved in retro­
grade transport of recycling endosomes (56), a pathway exploited 
by many viruses throughout their life cycle (57) that may also be rel­
evant to cross­presentation in the context of a vaccine response (58). 
Last, MVP is the major subunit of the vault complex, a multiprotein 
structure involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport. It is induced by 
double­stranded RNA and virus infection and is essential for the in­
duction of interleukin­6 (IL­6) and IL­8, suggesting an important 
role in host proinflammatory response (59). High expression of MVP 
has been shown to suppress viral replication by inducing a type 1 in­
terferon response through nuclear factor B, establishing a further 
link with the inflammatory component identified in the module anal­
ysis (60). The implication of the B cell signaling module is broadly 
consistent with the findings of Tsang et al. (7), who identified predic­
tive populations before vaccination that included CD20+ transitional 
and memory B cells that express CD38. Together, the implication of 
B cell signaling and inflammatory response modules suggests that 
overall immune status at the time of vac­
cination can influence the course of the 
vaccine response. Collectively, these find­
ings support the idea of an active basal 
immunological state that can enhance 
antigen presentation and inflammatory 
response, hence resulting in a more ef­
fective vaccine response. Further studies 
are needed to determine whether these 
signatures are associated specifically with 
influenza vaccination or rather reflect vac­
cination responses in general.
The cohorts analyzed in this study in­
cluded both young and older individuals, 
which were analyzed separately based on 
the observation that these groups display 
qualitatively different antibody and tran­
scriptional responses to influenza vacci­
nation. Our own analysis of the combined 
age groups in the discovery cohort found 
that the response was dominated by the 
young adults, and the older cohort did 
not provide additional insights. Although the number of individuals 
was similar in both age groups, significant gene and pathway signatures 
could only be validated for young individuals. Our superior perfor­
mance in the young may be expected because of the increased hetero­
geneity in older adults given the presence of age­related diseases and 
a larger age span. Surprisingly, we found that the effect sizes of these 
genes were negatively correlated in young and older individuals. 
That is, genes that were positively associated with higher vaccina­
tion responses in young individuals tended to be negatively associated 
with higher vaccination responses in older individuals. Thus, in­
creased expression levels of our gene signature before vaccination were 
associated with better antibody responses in the young but were 
inversely correlated with those in older individuals (Fig. 8). The same 
negative correlation was observed for gene modules. For example, 
although the presence of an inflammatory gene signature was associ­
ated with an improved vaccination response in young individuals, it 
was associated with a worse response in older individuals. There are 
many potential explanations for this observation, including differences 
in cell composition, cell activation state, the extent of chronic in­
flammation in older individuals, the possibility of intrinsic differences 
in vaccination responses of young and older adults, and the observed 
age­related change in transcriptional noise and cell­to­cell protein ex­
pression variation in immune cells (61–63). The underlying reason for 
this inverse relationship is unclear and warrants further study.
There are several potential limitations of the current study. Al­
though the results are based on multiple independent studies, the 
validation of the young and older signatures was each based on a 
single independent cohort, and it will be important to further confirm 
these observations in additional studies. The integration of additional 
studies will also provide increased power to detect subtle differences 
in immune state that are associated with vaccination responses. Lack 
of power may be one explanation for why the current analysis failed 
to identify validated signatures in older adults. The failure to validate 
signatures identified in older adults may also be due to the fact that 
the average age of the validation cohort was substantially lower than 
that of the discovery cohort. Another concern relates to the influence 
of differences in cell subset frequencies. The transcriptional profiling

data analyzed here were based on PBMCs and whole blood and thus 
reflect a mix of cell types. We used deconvolution analysis to con­
firm that the signatures we identified did not simply reflect variations 
in frequencies of major cell subsets. However, because of sample size 
limitations, the adjustment included only four major cell subsets 
(B cells, monocytes, and CD4 and CD8 T cells) and did not include 
potential effects conferred by cell subsets that lie deeper in the 
hematopoietic hierarchy.
In summary, we have integrated data from the HIPC and the CHI 
to conduct a multicohort analysis to identify baseline (i.e., before vac­
cination) predictive transcriptional signatures of influenza vaccina­
tion responses, and the effects of these signatures were inversely 
correlated between young and older individuals. In addition to 
potentially enabling the prediction of antibody responses before vac­
cination in the clinic and in vaccine trials, these results provide hy­
potheses on potential biological mechanisms underlying successful 
influenza vaccination responses and how these mechanisms could 
change with age. More broadly, the discovery of baseline signatures 
offers the possibility of modulating an individual’s immune state be­
fore vaccination to improve the resulting antibody response. All of the 
data used in this study are available from ImmPort and ImmuneSpace.
METHODS
Influenza vaccination response cohorts and data
All participants received injectable trivalent influenza vaccine. Raw and 
processed data are available from ImmuneSpace (https://immunespace.
org), and data can also be obtained from ImmPort (http://immport.org). 
The discovery cohorts are identified by ImmPort study numbers SDY63, 
SDY400, SDY404, and SDY212. The validation cohorts are SDY80 
and SDY67. To match the age composition of the discovery cohorts, 
we only included individuals below 35 or above 60 years of age in the 
analysis of the validation cohorts. The SDY212 data set was derived 
from whole blood, whereas all others were derived from PBMC sam­
ples. Transcriptional profiling of SDY63, SDY404, and SDY400 used 
HumanHT­12 V4.0 expression beadchip (Illumina), whereas SDY212 
was performed on HumanHT­12 V3.0 expression beadchip (Illumi­
na). Illumina data from the above four studies were log­transformed 
and quantile­normalized using the Lumi package in R. The microarray 
data from SDY80 was run on HuGene­1_0­st array (Affymetrix) and 
normalized by robust multichip average. SDY67 was an RNA­seq study 
run on HiSeq 2000 (Illumina), and read count data were summarized by 
gene and normalized using DESeq (64). The transcriptional profiling data 
from SDY67 were obtained in two experimental batches, and only data 
from the larger batch were used in this study.
Identification of low, moderate, and high  
vaccine responders
We adopted the adjMFC metric used in a previous systems biology 
study of influenza vaccination [SDY80; see the extended experimental 
procedure of Tsang et al. (7) for details]. This metric was adopted 
for three main reasons. First, this measure mitigates the effect of pre­
vaccination serology on the predictive signatures. This is important 
given that preexisting titers against influenza are highly prevalent, 
exhibit substantial variability across individuals, and are observed 
to correlate in a nonlinear manner with the fold change in titers after 
vaccination (Fig. 3A) (11). The adjMFC metric captures the response 
variability among individuals with similar preexisting titers and thus 
“decorrelates” the initial titers from the response based on fold change 
to enable the identification of predictive signatures independent of 
initial serology (7). Second, given that none of the gene expression 
measurements we assessed reflected specificity to any of the indi­
vidual influenza strains that comprised the vaccines, using the max­
imum response across all viral strains, as captured by the adjMFC 
metric, is more appropriate and can potentially provide better sen­
sitivity, compared with using the response to each strain individually 
(7, 12). Last, the adjMFC metric reflects the relative response across 
individuals instead of treating the titer values and their fold changes 
as absolute measurements and thus can potentially mitigate the ef­
fect of noise in titer measurements (25).
Here, we provide a concise description of how adjMFC was com­
puted. Given that the vaccines used in our cohorts contained three 
to four strains (usually three, but in the 2009 season, the seasonal strains 
were supplemented with an additional pandemic H1N1 strain), we 
quantitated both preexisting (baseline) and response serology by 
computing the maximum across all strains. Titer calculations were 
performed separately for each cohort and age group (young and older; 
see above). Titers were measured at days 0 and 28 by HAI for all 
studies except SDY80, which used virus neutralization assay (VNA) 
at days 0 and 70. A titer of half the first dilution was assigned to sam­
ples in which the first dilution was negative except for SDY404, for 
which the first dilution (1:8) was reported. In all studies, the largest 
dilution was reported if the largest dilution was positive. To help 
ensure that baseline titers and response fold changes of individual 
strains were comparable, so that the maximum is meaningful, we 
standardized titers for each strain at baseline (day 0) by subtracting 
the median and then scaling by the SD. We then defined the base­
line (relative) titer for each individual as the maximum across stan­
dardized baseline values for all strains. Similarly, we used the same 
approach to standardize the titer response fold change (usually day 
28 over day 0) and called these the MFC. In addition, we applied the 
inverse normal transformation to the MFC values to avoid extreme 
skews in the distribution. We next plotted baseline and MFC, and as 
previously observed, we saw a strong nonlinear inverse correlation 
between them in all of our data sets. To compute adjMFC (i.e., remov­
ing the nonlinear correlations), we binned the individuals based on 
their baseline titer so that the correlation between baseline and re­
sponse titers within each bin was not statistically significant, and at 
the same time, we tried to keep the number of bins as low as possible 
so that each bin would have a reasonable number of individuals for 
decorrelation. Typically, two to three bins were used. In some of our 
cohorts, there were a few outlier individuals with extremely high base­
line titers and correspondingly small response fold changes; they were 
removed from further analysis. For each bin, we computed the decor­
related responses (adjMFC) by standardizing the MFC values within 
each bin, that is, subtracting the median and scaling by the SD. Last, 
individuals within each cohort were defined as low, moderate, and 
high responders using percentile cutoffs (7). To accommodate the 
relatively small number of individuals in some of the cohorts, we 
defined low, moderate, and high responders as those whose adjMFC 
was lower than the 30th percentile value, between the 30th and the 
70th percentile values, and above the 70th percentile value, respectively. 
After applying the decorrelation procedure, we also performed a num­
ber of diagnostic checks to ensure that our approach had achieved 
the desired effects. Specifically, we confirmed the following: (i) The 
correlation between baseline titer and the adjMFC was removed on 
the basis of the Spearman rank correlation; (ii) at the individual strain 
level, the correlation between the baseline titer and the response fold

change was statistically insignificant (i.e., before aggregation of the 
individual titer per strain via computing the maximum); (iii) the iden­
tity of the strain that contributed to the baseline (or response fold 
change) maximum did not correlate with adjMFC. In all of the above 
checks, two variables were considered not correlated if the Spearman 
correlation P value was greater than 0.1.
Integrated multicohort analysis
Gene expression data sets were analyzed using a computational 
framework for integrated multicohort analysis (17, 20, 23). Briefly, 
for each gene expression data set used as a discovery cohort, we labeled 
samples either as a case or as a control and then computed a Hedges’ 
g effect size for each gene in each data set. The individual effect sizes 
were then integrated into a single summary effect size per gene across 
all discovery data sets. Significant genes were then identified using 
z statistics, and P values were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing 
using Benjamini­Hochberg FDR correction. We generated a response 
score from signature genes by computing the geometric mean of the 
expression of the individual genes within a given individual. We then 
estimated the response score accuracy in discriminating high and low 
responders by generating a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve and computing the AUC. A t test was carried out to compare 
response scores between low and high responders at various post­
vaccination time points in the validation cohort (SDY80).
Gene module analysis
The set of 346 BTMs were obtained from (27). Gene module activity 
was calculated using QuSAGE version 2.0.0 (24). The activity of each 
gene module (comparing high vaccine responders versus lower vac­
cine responders) was first quantified independently for each of the 
discovery cohorts using QuSAGE to produce a PDF. A meta­analysis 
was then carried out by combining the activity PDFs generated for 
each of the discovery cohorts into a single PDF using numerical con­
volution. The sizes of each cohort were used as weight factors during 
numeric convolution. P values for each gene module were calculated 
by testing whether the activity was different from zero using a two­sided 
test. Gene modules associated with influenza vaccination response 
were detected by P ≤ 0.01 and FDR ≤ 0.3. To identify related gene 
modules from KEGG (28) and Reactome (29) and the modules de­
fined in Obermoser et al. (16), we used regular expressions to extract 
gene modules containing the keywords “inflamm,” “b[_]*cell,” and 
“platelet.”
Correction for cell proportion variations
Flow cytometry measurements for the validation cohort (SDY80) 
were obtained from http://chi.nhlbi.nih.gov/DATA/chi/09­H­0239/
flow. The transcriptional profiles associated with this cohort were 
then adjusted for variation in four major cell subset proportions 
(B cells, monocytes, and CD4 and CD8 T cells) using the flow cytometry 
data expressed as percentage of total PBMCs. For each gene sepa­
rately, we fit a linear model with intercept (using the R function lm) 
on the normalized non–log­transformed data, including proportions 
as covariates. The complete adjusted transcriptional profiling data 
were then computed as the sum of the intercept coefficient and the 
residuals, and back log2–transformed.
Availability of data in ImmPort and ImmuneSpace
The data used in this study were generated by HIPC and CHI, a 
National Institutes of Health intramural affiliate of HIPC. The HIPC 
program is a major collaborative effort that is generating large amounts 
of human immune profiling data—including high­dimensional data—
to characterize the status of the immune system in diverse popula­
tions under both normal conditions and in response to stimuli (e.g., 
vaccination). Data management is an integral part of the program, 
and to address the issues involved with integrating and disseminating 
such data, HIPC has developed ImmuneSpace (https://immunespace.
org), a high­quality public web interface to HIPC data. ImmuneSpace 
facilitates retrieval, exploration, and comparison of data across in­
dependent studies. To support the wide range of immunological 
experiments being carried out, HIPC is taking advantage of the con­
siderable infrastructure already developed as part of the National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Immunology 
Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) system (https://immport.
niaid.nih.gov), which serves as a repository of data generated by in­
vestigators funded by the NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, 
and Transplantation. Data from ImmPort are automatically loaded 
into ImmuneSpace and joined with basic metadata (e.g., cohort 
membership and treatment information) to facilitate data explora­
tion, visualization, and analyses. ImmuneSpace also provides addi­
tional standardization to facilitate data integration. For example, gene 
expression data in ImmuneSpace are preprocessed using standardized 
pipelines ensuring that the same normalization is used, gene names 
are consistent, etc. ImmuneSpace also provides a “Data Finder” inter­
face for filtering participants across assays and studies based on a set 
of predefined study and assay variables, making it easy to browse and 
search extremely large combined data sets from dozens of studies and 
tens of thousands of participants. An R package (ImmuneSpaceR) is 
also available to facilitate programmatic access to data. Using these 
interfaces, the studies included in the analysis presented here can 
easily be identified, combined, and explored to gain further insights.
