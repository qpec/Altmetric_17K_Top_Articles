Cycling as a healthy and environmental friendly transport mode is gaining popularity.
Most research on cyclist safety is focused on crashes involving light vehicles, trucks, or
pedestrians. Only a few studies address single-bicycle crashes, and fewer focus on bicycle
crashes at skewed railroad grade crossing. This study relies on empirical video data col-
lected from a heavily travelled railroad grade crossing over a two month period, covering
more than 2000 bicycle traversings and 32 single-bicycle crashes caused by tire interac-
tion with the rail flangeway. A representative random sample of 100 successful traversings
were drawn from the population and analyzed against the crashes. Video data was mined
to identify crash factors, including demographic, riding behavior, bicycle characteristics,
and environmental characteristics. A binary logistic regression model was built to explore
factors that influence bicycle crashes. Approach angle is the most significant determinant
of crashes, with a critical traversing angle of 30°. Group riders, women, and wet roadway
conditions all contribute to higher odds of a crash. Crash rates are dramatically reduced at
approach angles greater than 30°, and (in our dataset), non-existent at angles greater than
60°. Road-railway crossing should be designed with increased scrutiny. We suggest
countermeasures, like jughandle designs, that improve the approach angle for cyclists.
This study focuses on bicycle crash at railway crossings using empirical data. It fills up the
gap in the research on this type of crashes and addresses issues on potential bicycle fa-
cility design at railway crossings.

1. Introduction
Cycling is a transportation mode with a wide range of individual and public health benefits (Frumkin et al. 2004: Teschke
et al. 2012; Ma and Dill 2015). Many cities throughout the world have been making efforts to improve cycling infrastructure.
As cycling increases, safety challenges manifest around infrastructure that was not carefully designed for cyclists. Most
research on cyclist safety is focused on crashes involving cars or trucks, pedestrians, or even riding under the influence. Only
a few studies address single-bicycle crashes, and fewer still focus on crashes that involve traversing railway tracks, where
the cyclist loses control when their wheel interacts with the rail flangeway. Railway grade crossings occur where a road or
mixed use cycle path crosses at least one set of at-grade railway tracks. Other instances where railway operate within
roadways (e.g., streetcars) also introduce hazards. Potential conflicts between trains and cyclists and potential crashes of

 cyclists must be addressed due to the rate and severity of crashes (Noyce, 2013). There are over 100,000 at-grade rail
crossings in the USA in 2015 (Federal Railroad Administration). Additionally, many cities have on-road streetcar and tram
tracks with continuous bicycle conflict zones (Lovely Bicycle 2009; Let's Go Ride; a Bike 2009; I Love Biking SF 2013). Despite
being a known risk that is detrimental to increased cycling rates, few studies have investigated the magnitude of this risk. In
a Portland, Oregon survey, over 67% of 1520 respondents said they have had a bike crash on streetcar or light trail tracks.
Some cyclists list rail tracks as top cause of single bike crashes (Let's Go Ride a Bike, 2009). A different study found about 22%
of injured electric bicyclists were injured after being caught in tram tracks in Switzerland (Papoutsi et al., 2014). These
crashes could diminish the retention of existing, potentially inexperienced, cyclists and cycing's associated transportation
and health benefits.
There is little design guidance and understanding of the mechanics of bicycle crashes at rail crossings. The US Depart-
ment of Transportation policy statement recommends that the design of bicycle facilities follow the commonly available
standards and design guidelines, such as the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO)’s
Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities. AASHTO recommends crossing angle, crossing surface, bikeway width, and
flange opening are key factors to railroad grade crossing for bicycles (AASHTO, 2012). Noyce (2013) suggests road designers
should minimize the negative effects of the flangeway gap since it would create safety hazard for bicyclists. However, to date
there are no empirical analyses or data to assess the mechanics of single bicycle crashes at railroad crossings. This problem is
under researched, in part, because single-bicycle crashes are rarely reported in official road crash statistics with enough
detail to inform policy or design (Langley et al., 2003; Schepers et al., 2014).
This paper aims to fill this important gap by focusing on the mechanics of bicycle crashes caused by railway tracks,
building a model that will include the most important factors influencing bicycle crashes on tracks, and suggesting solutions
for grade crossings. This study relies on continuous video monitoring of a heavily traveled grade crossing over a two month
period, covering more than 2000 traversings and including 32 single-bicycle crashes. A representative random sample of
100 successful traversings were drawn from the population and the video data was dissected to assess crash factors, in-
cluding demographic, riding behavior, bicycle characteristics, and environmental characteristics. A binary logistic regression
model is developed to describe bicycle crashes on the tracks and explore the key factors to cross successfully or crash. This
study fills a gap in the research literature on this type of crash and addresses issues on potential bicycle facility design and
road-railway crossing design. The results of this study could also be extended to streetcar or other rail crossings.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. A literature review of bicycle crashes is given in the next section, followed
by data collection methods, research methodology, model results and discussion, and finally conclusions and limitations.
2. Background
Research on bicycle safety can be classified into two categories: bicycle related multi-vehicle crashes, and single-bicycle
crashes. Many studies have contributed to the literature on bicycle related multi-vehicle crashes in recent decades, including
examining crash types, crash occurrence and frequency, injury severity, crash locations. Most bicycle-vehicle crashes
(especially severe) are reported in crash databases. This body of research tends to focus on risk factors and offer roadway
design and traffic control department guidelines for safety improvement (Chen and Shen, 2016). According to previous
research, these risk factors can be classified into six groups, including demographic profiles, behavior related factors, vehicle
types and crash characteristics, traffic design and controls, environment related factors, and land use and socioeconomic
variables (Chen and Shen, 2016).
Some studies focus on specific factors on bicycle crash frequency. Alcohol was found to increase bicycle crash risks (Li
and Baker, 1994; Andersson and Bunketorp, 2002). Researchers found that age is a significant risk factor, with on young (18–
24 years) and older (4 65 years) cyclists having higher crash risk (Rodgers, 1997; Stone and Broughton, 2003; Wang et al.,
2014). Public health literature reveals that helmet use is an effective way to prevent cyclists from being injured in the event
of a crash (Curnow, 2003; Macpherson et al., 2004; Graves et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). Most researchers have found that
bike lanes and improved bicycle crossings improve safety and reduce injuries (Aultman-Hall and Michael Adams, 1998,
Gårder et al., 1998), while others argued that they tended to increase injuries (Moritz, 1998). Cyclists struck by larger
vehicles have higher risk of serious and fatal injuries compared to those struck by passenger vehicles (Maki et al., 2003).
Some socioeconomic factors, such as the percentage of poor households within a neighborhood can play an important role
in bicycle crash rates (Epperson, 1995). Prato (2015) emphasized heterogeneity and spatial correlation are significant factors
to the probability of cyclists-motorist crash occurrence.
For cyclists’ injury severity levels, demographic characteristics were found to have significant influence on cyclists’ injury
severity including age, gender, and drug and alcohol use (Stone and Broughton, 2003; Kim et al., 2007; Stipdonk and
Reurings, 2012; Hu et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Martínez-Ruiz et al., 2015). Roadway (e.g. alignment) and traffic (e.g.,
speed) characteristics also have significant influence on injury severity (Klop and Khattak, 1999; Stone and Broughton, 2003;
Teschke et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2014; Kröyer, 2015). Environmental factors also influence injury severity – darkness, rain, and
fog tend to increase injury severity (Klop and Khattak, 1999; Kim et al., 2007; Wang et al. 2014). Finally, conflict type impacts
injury severity (Kim et al., 2007; Eluru et al., 2008; Moore et al. 2011). Angle crashes with motorized vehicles turning right
(i.e. right hook crashes) are the most frequent type of bicycle-motor vehicle crash. Head-on collisions more than double the
probability of a cyclist suffering a fatal injury (Kim et al., 2007).

 A few studies have focused on single-bicycle crashes. De Rome et al. (2014) interviewed cyclists injured from November
2009 to May 2010 in Australia, finding that 52% of these participants were injured in single bicycle crashes. Kroon (1990)
classified single-bicycle crashes into three types including crash caused by the cyclists themselves, by the infrastructure, or
by mechanical failure. Schepers and Wolt (2012) identified that half of all single-bicycle crashes are related to infrastructure.
Some researchers found that road surface and lighting conditions have significant contribution to single-bicycle crashes
(Nyberg et al., 1996; Boufous et al. 2013). More than 80% of on-road single bicycle crashes occurred because cyclists lost
control of the bicycle (Boufous et al., 2013). Other possible factors include forces on the front wheel, or risky riding behavior
(Schepers and Wolt, 2012). Regarding rail crossings, Noyce (2013) pointed out road designers should minimize the negative
effects of the flangeway gap since it would create safety hazard for bicyclists. Rail crossings were first introduced into design
guidance in North America in 2012 (AASHTO, 2012), where crossing angle, crossing surface, bikeway width, and flange
opening play an important role on railroad grade crossings for bicyclists. However, none of those recommendations are
based on empirical research.
Although some studies have discussed some guidelines for bicyclists traversings at railroad grade crossing, they only
provide some general frameworks for road designers. This study would empirically estimate the mechanics of bicycle
crashes caused by railway tracks and discuss possible variables that would help to better explain the varying crash me-
chanisms and better support road designers and transportation engineering departments.
3. Data collection
Single-bicycle crashes are underreported in official road crash statistics (Schepers et al., 2014), and hospital records are
generally limited to severe injuries and do not collect detailed crash data (Aldred and Crosweller, 2015). In this study, we
rely on a video based observation of a single skewed rail crossing. From that video, we extract data of the entire traversing
process (approach, traversing, and departure) of each bicycle across the railroad tracks. A freight and passenger rail line that
crosses Neyland Drive in Knoxville, Tennessee was selected for monitoring and data collection, shown in Fig. 1. There are
two cyclist grade crossings in this area; a parallel shared use 3 m (10 ft.) wide shared-use pathway (greenway) on the north
side of the roadway (�20° rail skew tangent to tangent) and a wide (�3.5 m or 11.5 ft.) shoulder on the south side of the
roadway (�10° rail skew). In both cases, cyclists can cross the rails at approximately 45° at low speeds within the shoulder
or greenway. On the shoulder, many cyclists cross into the adjacent travel lanes to cross the tracks at larger angles. The speed
limit on Neyland Drive is 72 km/h (45 mph). This study focuses on the shoulder crossing because of better visibility from the

 camera location. The camera was positioned on the fourth floor of a building approximately 137 m (450 ft.) from the
crossing. The video was captured continuously at 720p resolution at 30 frames per second from August 2, 2014 to October 3,
2014 and was analyzed using Luxriot software. The shoulder crossing approach is used by all types of cyclists, from ex-
perienced road cyclists to young children. In general, the rate of use for the most inexperienced cyclists are lower on the
shoulder than the separated greenway (e.g. children only constitute 2.5% on shoulder and 7.4% on greenway, of the 13,247
cyclists we observed), but this approach still attracts a diverse set of users.
During the study period, 13,247 cyclists traversed the crossings, including 9,521 on the Neyland Greenway (Eastbound
and Westbound) and 2,091 on Neyland Drive shoulder (Eastbound), with the remaining 1,635 traversing at different parts of
the roadway. While we report total traversings and crashes, this paper focuses on modeling crashes on the road shoulder.
Fig. 2 shows cyclist volume varying by date and time in colored cells (because of technology problems, we lost several days’
data shown in white). Fig. 2 indicates that cyclists were distributed from 6:00 to 22:00, while largest cyclist volumes
occurred during 10:00 to 12:00, and 18:00 to 20:00 respectively. During the study period, 53 crashes occurred at the
crossing, including 21 (crash rate: 2.2 per 1000 traversings) on the Neyland Greenway (both directions) and 32 (crash rate:
15.3 per 1000 traversings) on Neyland Drive shoulder (eastbound) (orange dots in Fig. 2). Fig. 2 shows most crashes occurred
during the 10:00 to 20:00 time period, specifically, over half (17) of the crashes happened between 15:00 to 18:00.
Due to the restricted view and geometric characteristics, we only focus on traversings and crashes that occur on the
eastbound shoulder of Neyland Drive. That crossing is constructed from pre-cast concrete panels that includes a uniform
6.35 cm (2.5 in.) wide and 7.6–10.2 cm (3–4 in.) deep flangeway gap between the rail and the panel. An example of a bicycle
crash mechanism at the railway crossing is shown in Fig. 3. In previous matched case-control studies in transportation area,
control cases were selected for the same location at the same time but in different weeks to study motorized vehicle crashes
(Abdel-Aty et al., 2004; Ahmed and Abdel-Aty, 2012; Shi and Abdel-Aty, 2015). The motivation is to control the possible
variability caused by time of day, weather, season, and roadway geometric designs (Shi and Abdel-Aty, 2015). We drew a
sample of 100 random and representative (through a random number generator) non-crash traversings to further scrutinize
against the 32 crashes, yielding a case:control ratio of about 1:3.
As shown in Table 1, demographic factors, bicycle related factors, traffic, environmental factors, and crash severity were
collected. Notably, since we are only able to investigate one crossing, we cannot assess the effect of different design ele-
ments on crashes.

 factor's distribution, or population means between non-crash and crash samples. For binomial factors, such as gender, a chi-
squared test was used. For Gaussian distributed factors, such as approaching speed and traversing speed, a t-test was used.
Of the 132 observations, about 17% of cyclists were women, yet they represent about 38% of the crashes (p¼0.0007). It is
unclear why women are over-represented, except that women may be less experienced cyclists (Emond et al., 2009; Bíl
et al., 2010) or might have different ability to overcome sudden torque when hitting the track. Cyclists’ ages are distributed
across all ages, while 77.3% are in the estimated 20–40 years category. Most (78.8%) of the cyclists wore a helmet,1 while
only 56.3% of cyclists in crashes used a helmet (p¼0.0007). Obvious braking efforts immediately before traversing were
different, with 30.3% of all cyclists obviously braking, while 62.5% of crashing cyclists made braking efforts (po0.0001).
Ambient light also had different crash rates, 5.3% cyclists crossed during twilight times, but 12.5% crashes occurred with
twilight. More crashes happened when road was damp or wet (p¼0.0184). Adjacent car traffic was present is almost half of
the total sample. The average approaching speed of total sample is 4.2 m/s, while that of crashes is 3.7 m/s (p¼0.0300).
Among crash cases, about 60% of the cyclists had seemingly minor injuries (i.e., non-incapacitating) and one cyclist was
seriously injured and transported by ambulance.

 non-crashes. Nearly 90% of the crashes occurred at traversing angles less than 30°, whereas 74% of the successful traversings
approaches were greater than 30°. Still, nearly one quarter of traversings less than the critical 30° threshold are successful.
4.2. Model development and discussion
The binary logistic regression model is widely used in road safety studies including cyclists’ safety studies where the
response variable is binary (Zhang et al., 2000; Simončič, 2001; Tay et al., 2008). In a model of crashes and non-crashes, the
logit is the natural logarithm of the odds or the likelihood ratio that the dependent variables is 1 (crash) as opposed to 0
(non-crash). The probability P of a traverse in respondent mode is given by

Where β is a vector of parameters to be estimated and X is a vector of independent variables include demographics, cyclist
riding performance, and environmental factors. Compared to the descriptive results in Table 2, the logit model in Table 3
presents all factors that could contribute to crash rates and allows for simultaneous control of explanatory variables.
The overall model is statistically significant against the null model (po0.001). Several insignificant factors were re-
moved. Traversing angles were transferred into the midpoints for each angle class (e.g., 40–50 ¼ 45 degrees). From Table 3,
two cyclist related variables including number of people in a group and gender have a significant effect on crash or non-
crash outcomes. Crashes are more likely to occur among female cyclists. The log odds of crashes for males decrease by 3.506
(p¼0.004). This effect is consistent with the finding in descriptive statistics section where men might have unobserved
characteristics that allow them to avoid crashes, holding all else equal. Individual cyclists (non-group riders) have a reduced
log odds of crash (�3.475) compared to a cyclist in a group that has 3 or more people (p¼0.044). Having two people in a
group versus 3 or more people decreases the log odds of crash by 2.984 (p¼0.037). This effect is similar to other studies of
increased risk of group riding of motorcycles, where inexperienced riders can be put in situations outside their level of
comfort (Chorlton et al., 2012). Another possible situation is cyclists in a group with three or more people may have dif-
ficulty maneuvering to adopt a larger traversing angle or may have less chance to notice railroad crossing and warning
signage.
As expected, the traversing angle is an important variable in this model, and the variable the can influence. Traversing
angle has a strong effect on crash outcome, with low crash angles yielding high crash rates. For every 1° increase in the
traversing angle, the log odds of a crash decreases by 0.270. This finding is intuitive and consistent with suggestions and
design recommendations proposed by Noyce (2013) and, AASHTO (2012) that perpendicular traversing help minimize the
chances of a bicycle's front wheel getting caught in the flangeway. However, based on our descriptive analysis, the design
does not need to reach (the recommended) 90° traversing angles to be safe.
Though approach speed is significantly different from crash and non-crash outcomes in the descriptive statistics (Ta-
ble 2), controlling for other variables it is insignificant in this model. Obvious braking has a significant positive effect on
crash or non-crash outcomes (p¼0.002). Possible reason for the effect could be experienced cyclists or cyclists who are
familiar with the crossing have already know how to traverse successfully, so they did not brake before traversing. It could

 also a more causal effect – braking reduces overall control and contributes to the mechanics of the crash. The log odds of a
crash increases by 4.215 compared to no braking before traversing. Moreover, road surface conditions contribute to higher
crash rates, riders on dry surface has lower crash probability than on wet road surface, decreasing the log odds of crash by
5.803 (p¼0.014), which is consistent with the observation that rubber and steel materials in crossings that are slippery
when wet (AASHTO, 2012).
For bike type, though difference between mountain bikes (wide tires, wide handle bars) and road bikes (narrow tires,
narrow handle bars) are insignificant, there are still some possible influence on crashes. For example mountain bike tire
width and tread may be more capable of traversing the gap and handlebars are generally wider, allowing more control.
Helmet use is insignificant in the model. However, non-crashes and crashes have significant different distribution of cyclists
who wore helmet or not (shown in Table 2), implying some confounding in the model. There are several reasons for this
finding, including potential inexperience, helmet use by bicycle type, or others. With the small sample, it is difficult to
untangle these effects. Among the removed factors, adjacent traffic present is also an interesting factor that could have
multiple effects. Adjacent traffic could cause the riders to adopt smaller crossing angles since they have less perceived space
to maneuver and their trajectory goes into the adjacent traffic lane. Most crash victims landed in the vehicle travel lane,
introducing substantial safety risks. Psychological factors, like stress from high speed traffic, could be associated with dif-
ferent behavior while crossing. For example, one experienced rider interviewed after a crash heard a car approaching from
behind and was convinced the car was crowding her, which contributed to the crash. However, the video showed the car
was in the inside lane.
5. Conclusion
The purpose of this paper was to document the factors influencing single bicycle crashes on a skewed railroad grade
crossing, a known problem with very little empirical analysis. A railroad crossing on Neyland Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee

 was chosen as the field study site because of high bicycle traffic on a skewed crossing and that could easily be continuously
monitored. We observed 13,247 cyclists traversing two sections of the railway over about two months. The crash rates were
much higher than expected and almost all of them were unreported. The crash rate on the shoulder (eastbound) over this
period was 15.3 per 1000 traversings, while the crash rate of the greenway (eastbound and westbound) was 2.2 per 1000
traversings. This is the first study that uses empirical video data to identify factors on detailed crossing and crash processes
quantitatively. Factors cover cyclist characteristics, bicycle type, riding behavior, geometric characteristics, and weather.
A binary logistic regression model was built to explore the key factors to traverse successfully or crash. Although ap-
proach angle is the most obvious and important factor to consider when designing rail crossings, other environmental or
rider attributes influence crash outcomes. For example, group riders, women, and wet roadway conditions all contribute to
higher crash rates. Facilities that share these characteristics should be designed with increased scrutiny. Crash rates are
reduced dramatically at approach angles greater than 30°, and (in our dataset), non-existent at angles greater than 60°. We
suggest countermeasures, like jughandle designs, that improve the traversing angle for cyclists. Improving traversing angle
up to 90° is ideal but often infeasible due to space constraints. Any traversing angle more than 30° would be highly effective
at reducing crashes and providing traversing angles greater than 60° would effectively eliminate them.
The crossing studied here was infeasible to construct at a crossing angle that approached 90°. Responding to the pro-
blem, the City of Knoxville did construct a jughandle design (Fig. 5) with a tangent angles of 57°, with a possible minimum
angle of 37° (inside-to-outside of bike lane). This design encourage cyclists approach this crossing with larger than 37°
angle. It has effectively eliminated crashes except in cases where cyclists traverse the hash marks and cross at low angles.
Future research will further evaluate rider behavior and crash performance under this design.
This paper provides researchers, planners and engineers with railroad crossings-specific tools and results to improve
potential bicycle path design and road-railway crossing design. The results of this study would also support design in similar
situations, like streetcar or light trail tracks, or evaluating other treatment crossings, such as the effectiveness of mechanical
flangeway fillers.
6. Limitations
There are two main limitations to this study. First, this study only collects data from one site so that the representa-
tiveness is limited in some extent. Notably, we cannot assess the effect of different design elements on crashes. Second, a
larger sample size from this site could further improve the accuracy and reliability of model performance. However, this is
the first empirical analysis of rail grade crossings and single bicycle crashes, a known risk that is often underreported. More
deliberate design of this infrastructure could result in reduced injury risk, while improving the attractiveness of bicycling.
