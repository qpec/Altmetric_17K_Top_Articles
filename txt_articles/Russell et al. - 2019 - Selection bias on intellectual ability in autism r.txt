Selection bias on intellectual ability in
autism research: a cross-sectional review
and meta-analysis

Abstract
Background: Current global estimates suggest the proportion of the population with autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) who have intellectual disability (ID) is approximately 50%. Our objective was to ascertain the existence of
selection bias due to under-inclusion of populations with ID across all fields of autism research. A sub-goal was to
evaluate inconsistencies in reporting of findings.
Methods: This review covers all original research published in 2016 in autism-specific journals with an impact factor
greater than 3. Across 301 included studies, 100,245 participants had ASD. A random effects meta-analysis was used
to estimate the proportion of participants without ID. Selection bias was defined as where more than 75% of participants
did not have ID.
Results: Meta-analysis estimated 94% of all participants identified as being on the autism spectrum in the studies
reviewed did not have ID (95% CI 0.91–0.97). Eight out of ten studies demonstrated selection bias against participants
with ID. The reporting of participant characteristics was generally poor: information about participants’ intellectual ability
was absent in 38% of studies (n = 114). Where there was selection bias on ID, only 31% of studies mentioned lack of
generalisability as a limitation.
Conclusions: We found selection bias against ID throughout all fields of autism research. We recommend transparent
reporting about ID and strategies for inclusion for this much marginalised group.

Introduction
Selection bias occurs when representation of the popula-
tion of interest, in this case people with autism spectrum
disorder (ASD), is not achieved on key characteristics.
Studies are vulnerable to selection and recruitment bias
when those with particular characteristics are excluded
or under-recruited [1]. Selection bias occurs when
samples are drawn from non-random sub-populations to
estimate what is happening in the whole population,
causing errors in the effect size estimation. We set out
to review whether participants with intellectual disability
(ID) are excluded or routinely under-recruited in studies
that feature people on the autism spectrum as the
population of interest. The only other study we know
of to address this topic is an annual research review
that reported bias on ID to be common in psychiatric
neuroscience, but the focus was limited to studies of
neuroimaging [2].
The inclusion of participants with ID in studies of
autism is important because our knowledge base about
autism is predicated on the assumption that what we
know about autism can be applied to all people with
autism. So for example, in the case of research about
autism interventions, if selection bias against partici-
pants with ID occurs, it will mean that interventions that
have been shown to improve outcomes may not be
effective in the population with ID.
To give a more concrete example, consider an autism
intervention trial that tests a parent-delivered behavioural
intervention

children,

 symptoms as a primary outcome. If data on the propor-
tion of autistic children with ID are not reported in either
the initial trial or the long-term follow-up, then it would
not be clear if there was selection bias on ID. If there is
selection bias on ID, however, the evidence for the effec-
tiveness of this intervention in the ID group would be
lacking. In this scenario, interventions, which are often
somewhat intensive and parent-mediated, may be erro-
neously recommended to parents already stretched by
having a child with challenging intellectual difficulties.
Mounting evidence suggests sub-groups on the autism
spectrum may have distinct aetiology, as well as varied
responses to interventions, treatment and diverse care
needs [3–5]. The argument above can be applied to any
autism research that focusses on the aetiology and deve-
lopmental pathways that lead to autistic symptoms and
traits. If our knowledge about autism genetics, for
example, is predicated on a sample primarily drawn
from children without ID, this may mean that genetic
predispositions to autism with ID are not correctly
understood. If such biases are not transparently reported
and acknowledged in citing literature, the implications
may be that the autism literature erroneously under-
stands the ‘genetics of autism’ which in fact best explains
cases without intellectual disability. Thus, our entire
knowledge base about autism rests on an assumption
that selection bias is not endemic in the research litera-
ture. Lack of evidence for autistic children with ID is
particularly concerning in the case of drug development
because parents of children with autism who have more
profound impairment are likely to be the most enthu-
siastic users of such treatments [6].
Of course, there are some instances of autism research
where exclusion of people with ID is scientifically neces-
sary. These include studies of the specific needs and
capacities of autistic people without ID, for example,
investigating their experiences in a university or employ-
ment within the technology sector. In most cases, how-
ever, strategies should be taken to ensure meaningful
inclusion of participants with ID is achieved [7].
Historically, 70–75% of autistic children were esti-
mated to have ID [8]. This figure has fallen, and recent
estimates suggest globally 50–55% have an IQ below 70
[9, 10]. This percentage is currently considered to be the
most reliable for the current prevalence. The historical
shift in the USA from a predominantly ‘lower function-
ing’ sample to a ‘higher functioning’ one has been docu-
mented in a sequential cohort study of over six million
children from California published in 2012 [11]. This
demonstrated the chances of autism diagnosis were 15
times greater for ‘high-functioning’ children in 2002
compared to 1992, whereas odds of diagnosis increased
only fourfold for the ‘lower functioning’ group. Clearly,
the prevalence of the proportion of autistic individuals
with ID is a moving target as more individuals without
ID are being identified today than previously [11].
Nevertheless, according to a worldwide systematic re-
view, the autism population is still ‘associated with intel-
lectual
impairment
among
a
large
and
significant
portion of those affected’ [12].
We hypothesised that many studies that are presented
as including people from the entire autism spectrum are
actually based on the findings drawn from predomin-
antly non-ID samples. Thus, our primary objective was
to assess if there was a selection bias by ID through all
sub-fields of autism research. A secondary objective was
to record the quality of reporting in studies concerning
potential selection bias.
Methods
We aimed to establish if all fields of autism research ex-
hibit selection bias. We utilised an established review
methodology [13] which provided a cross-sectional sam-
ple across 1 years’ autism research publications.
Sampling strategy
Figure 1 illustrates the sampling strategy for studies. To
sample a representative cross-section of strong and
influential autism research studies, we reviewed all
studies published in autism-specific journals with an
impact factor higher than 3 between 1 January 2016 and
31 December 2016 (dates for printed, as opposed to on-
line publication). The journals that met these criteria
were Molecular Autism, Autism Research, Journal of
Autism and Developmental Disorders, and Autism: Inter-
national Journal of Research and Practice. All studies
published in these journals were eligible for our sample.
The methodology was adapted from Lee and colleagues
[13]: like them, we developed a sampling protocol that is
easily replicable. We wanted to sample the literature at
one time point as estimates of the proportion of autistic
individuals with ID have shifted over time. A cross-sec-
tional method of review (over 1 year) was therefore best
placed to test our hypothesis.
It is important to emphasise that we did not set out to
undertake a full systematic review, although we utilised sys-
tematic review methodology in terms of screening titles,
data extraction techniques and meta-analysis to investigate
the presence and extent of selection bias among re-
search studies involving participants with autism.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
To be eligible, papers needed to report empirical research,
rather than commentaries, letters, editorials, reviews and
errata. We included data-based short reports and original
research articles that covered children or adults identified
as having ASD. We aimed to provide a cross-section of re-
search studies across the field where titles of published
Russell et al. Molecular Autism            (2019) 10:9 
Page 2 of 10
 studies stated the population of interest was people on the
autism spectrum. In order to test for selection bias, we de-
fined population of interest according to that stated in art-
icle titles. Articles were therefore included where the titles
referred to ‘autism’
, ‘autism spectrum disorders’ or ‘autism
spectrum conditions’
, i.e. stated population of interest was
the entire autism spectrum, and findings were applicable
to this. We therefore excluded research studies whose ti-
tles stated the population of interest were sub-groups of
the autism spectrum in terms of lower/higher cognitive
functioning. Examples that were excluded had titles
referring to ‘high-functioning’ or ‘minimally verbal’ groups
as their findings only applied to these groups. Included ar-
ticles were those where at least a proportion of the study
sample was identified as having ASD, regardless of the
study design. We excluded studies where part of the sam-
ple or the entire sample was in infancy (age below 2) be-
cause this is before autism can be reliably identified [14].
Also, IQ measurement is not possible in this group.
The process of screening for inclusion was carried out by
two researchers (DE, RW), who independently screened ti-
tles and abstracts. Disagreements and uncertainties were re-
solved by a discussion at weekly meetings (with GR and
TP) to resolve any uncertainties. For those records deemed
relevant after the title and abstract screening, full-text arti-
cles were retrieved. Articles were stored as full-text refer-
ences using Zotero software.
Data extraction
Data were extracted from 20 included studies by 4
researchers to develop a pilot data extraction form. The
remaining articles were divided between 3 researchers
(RW, DE and TP) who extracted data into the finalised
bespoke data extraction form. Over 20% of studies were
rated by 2 or more reviewers (n = 61). Inter-rater re-
liability was good to perfect: agreement values for
Cohen’s kappa for primary extractor (DE) vs secondary
extractor (RW) ranged from 0.72 to 1. The lower range
was due to the lack of consensus over sub-field, as some
studies belonged to multiple fields, data extractors some-
times coded studies under different sub-fields.
Articles were classified into six sub-fields based on the
categories provided by 2008 US funding portfolio analysis
(epidemiology; intervention studies; basic biology includ-
ing genetics, psychology and neuroscience; social and ser-
vices
research;
diagnostic
scales/identification
and
screening). After calculating kappa, studies were classified
into sub-field by consensus within the weekly team

 meetings. Data extracted from each published study in-
cluded the total number of participants and number of
participants on the autism spectrum, for the latter their
mean age and age range (which we classified as covering
children (age 2–10), adolescents, (age 11-18) adults (18
+)), gender ratios, whether participants were minimally or
non-verbal, exclusion criteria, sub-field of study, recruit-
ment setting and method of case ascertainment.
Data recorded for each included study are presented
in Additional file 1: Table S1. Additional file 2 gives a
complete citation list.
Primary objective: assessing selection bias by ID
Ascertaining ID
ID is often defined in autism research studies using
intelligence quotient (IQ) above and below 70. IQ is
used to define both ID [IQ < 70] and high-functioning
autism [IQ > 70] and is the most commonly used
sub-type in autism research [15, 16]. For each study
where data were available, we classified the proportion
of the ASD sample that did not have intellectual disabil-
ity (No ID) using procedures which have been applied
by others [9, 17]. The hierarchy below was used so that
1 was used in preference to 2, etc. We recorded the
number of studies that did not include any of this
information and estimated the proportion of ASD par-
ticipants in each study that have IQ above 70 (No ID).
The proportion of participants without ID was estimated
using the first two methods in two thirds of all cases (for
included studies).
1. Reported as having IQ above 70, cut-off based on
standard accepted ranges of intellectual disability
and borderline intellectual disability
2. Estimation of proportion with IQ above 70 taken
from the mean and SD of IQ
3. The proportion that was described as ‘high-
functioning’
4. The proportion that was identified as not having ID
We did not estimate numbers with ID where data
were missing, i.e. when studies did not report on any
measures we used to ascertain ID (above). We did not
impute data. Where data on ID were missing, we
recorded and reported on this.
Defining selection bias by ID
We categorised studies where over three quarters of the
sample were without an intellectual disability as showing
selection bias, as population estimates of levels of ID
among autistic people are around 50%. The highest pub-
lished epidemiological estimate of the prevalence of
ASD children without ID is 69%, taken from US parent
report [18]. This is likely an overestimate due to a
self-selecting sample. Nevertheless, to err on the side of
caution, we defined selection bias with a conservative
approach (a large bias where 75% or more of partici-
pants in each study had no ID).
Meta-analysis
We used random effects meta-analysis to estimate the
total proportion of all ASD participants who did not have
ID across all the included studies (where data were pro-
vided). This was achieved by weighting the estimate by the
number of ASD participants in each study using the meta-
prop command on Stata 15 software. We then estimated
the mean IQ overall and by sub-field of autism research.
We also estimated the overall proportion of non- and
minimally verbal autistic participants, where these data
were provided. As a sensitivity analysis, we meta-analysed
studies that had not actively excluded on ID.
Secondary objective: assessing quality of reporting within
and between studies
We wanted to find out about the quality of reporting as
well as selection bias. We recorded the number of
included studies that did not report any data on partici-
pants’ intellectual dis/ability according to the definition
above. We also recorded where studies that showed selec-
tion bias on ID did not report a lack of generalisability as
a limitation or mention sub-populations in their abstracts.
For included studies that did not contain any participants
with intellectual disability (100% No ID, N = 78), forward
citation chasing was carried out to establish whether later
publications cited the studies as a source of knowledge
about all people with autism or took the lack of generalis-
ability into account. ‘Forward citation chasing’ refers to the
method of finding articles that have cited a previously pub-
lished work. Cited reference searching was carried out in
Google Scholar, which indexes citing studies for each paper.
The first three published citing articles were selected where
more than three were available for one study. This method
of tracking citations is simply another way of searching
databases to find relevant sources and articles and has been
used in multiple reviews (e.g. [19, 20]).
Results
There were 563 eligible articles, in total, of which 301
studies were included (Fig. 1).
There were 7,215,166 participants across the 301
included studies, of which 100,245 participants were
identified as having ASD. The bulk of the non-autistic
participants came from a few very large population-based
studies, with one cohort accounting for over six million
participants [21]. Additional file 1: Table S1 shows attri-
butes of individual studies including the method of case
ascertainment. Table 1 shows the median number of
participants for each type of study. Overall, the median
Russell et al. Molecular Autism            (2019) 10:9 
Page 4 of 10
 number of participants identified as having ASD across
the 301 studies was 32. On average, four fifths of the
participants in each study were male.
Between disciplines, unsurprisingly, epidemiological
studies had the highest number of participants, and
basic
biological
studies
had
the
lowest
number.
Seventy-nine percent of studies covered children, adoles-
cents or both. Only two studies recruited adults where
the youngest participant was over 25. Thus, the majority
of ASD research was conducted with children and ado-
lescents, with few studies focussing on older adults.
Selection bias on ID
The majority (82%) of the 165 studies that provided
IQ/ID data showed selection bias against individuals with
ID (Table 2) despite declaring the population of interest to
be, and applying their findings to, the entire autism
spectrum. Column 5 of Table 2 shows that an estimated
94% of all ASD participants from 165 studies that
provided data did not have ID: the random pooled effect
was 0.94 (95% CI 0.94–0.97). Pooling data from all studies
where IQ was provided, the mean IQ was 93.8 (n = 136).
Figure 2 shows the forest plot for studies in epidemiology,
which was the field with the lowest bias. The random
pooled effect (given as the effect size in Stata output) is
illustrated by the dotted line in Fig. 2.
We also estimated the percentage of participants who
were non- or minimally verbal using meta-analysis of
the 50 studies that reported data: the random pooled
effect was 0.98 (95% CI 0.93–1.0). Thus, we estimated
that 94% of autistic participants in the included studies
did not have ID (an estimated 6% had ID) and only 2%
of participants were non- or minimally verbal. The ran-
dom pooled effect size in sensitivity analysis removing
studies that had deliberately excluded participants with
ID was 0.89 (95% CI 0.84–0.94).
Reporting quality within and between studies
Out of 301 included studies, most (55%, n = 165) did
provide ID data. A quarter, 25% (n = 77), of studies spe-
cifically excluded autistic participants with intellectual
disability as defined by our hierarchy. Over a third, 38%
(n = 114), did not report any data on ID status according
to
our
measures
or
exclude
participants
with
ID,
although some of these did report on rarer measures of
developmental
delay,
especially
studies
of
younger
children. Only a small proportion of included studies
reported data on the proportion of ASD participants

 who were verbal or non-verbal/minimally verbal: just 50
(17%) of the 301 studies.
One hundred and thirty-six of the 165 included studies
that did provide ID data showed selection bias against
participants with ID (Table 2). The majority of these
studies (52%) did not report sub-populations in their
abstracts or lack of generalisability (n = 71). Only 31%
mentioned a lack of generalisability or selection bias as a
limitation to the study. There was a wide variation in
quality in the way the lack of generalisability was pre-
sented for those that did refer to it, ranging from simply
stating the participant characteristics, e.g. ‘we only
looked at higher functioning children’ [22], to meticu-
lous
consideration
of
the
potential
for
biases, ‘we
acknowledge several limitations to this study. Data were
collected through a specialist clinical diagnostic service
for ASD, where adults are expected to have IQ in the
normal range. Thus the sample does not reflect the ASD
community as a whole’ [23].
Forward citation chasing
For studies that did not include any participants with
ID, we checked 187 later publications that cited the
2016 findings. Ninety-one percent of the citations
cited the 2016 results as being about autism generally
or applicable to all people with autism, despite being
drawn from studies where people with ID did not ap-
pear in the sample. Therefore, as we suspected, stud-
ies’ findings are typically generalised to the entire
spectrum despite being exclusively drawn from the in-
tellectually able group.
Discussion
Substantive findings
In order to learn about selection bias on ID in autism re-
search, we sampled all papers published in the most
cited specialist autism journals in 2016. First, the review
found considerable evidence of selection bias on ID: par-
ticipants with ID were under-recruited to all sub-fields
of autism research. Second, the reporting of participant
characteristics was generally poor, with information
about intellectual ability and/or ID often absent. There
was a limited discussion of this, and forward citation
chasing showed that citing authors did not typically
acknowledge bias.
Our findings are consistent with the review that
focused on brain imaging studies of autism, which found
people with ID were under-represented in neuroimaging
studies of autism [2]. It also tallies with individual
reports: for example, the US National Database of
Autism Research has 47,400 participants, but only 11%
have borderline ID or ID (IQ < 85) [24]. Our finding is
important because the validity of findings in individual
studies is grounded on the assumption that the recruit-
ment of study participants is not overly influenced by
selection bias.
For studies using samples without any ID participants,
forward citation chasing showed later papers typically
cited them to describe knowledge about the whole
autism spectrum, without taking sample profiles into ac-
count. Selection bias in participant characteristics might
mean much of the information we have about autism
may not be generalisable to all those with autism.

 Forward citation chasing illustrated how ‘facts’ travel
based on titles and abstracts alone. Only a minority of
studies displaying bias mentioned lack of generalisability
as a limitation, none referred to sub-samples in their
titles. Lack of generalisability was dealt with by some
studies in their limitations sections (e.g. [25–28]) but
sometimes in a cursory way, although others were
examples of best practice. We recommend that if a
No ID sample is used, this should be clearly stated in
the title and abstract.
Barriers to participation, and solutions
Selection bias on intellectual disability may occur in aut-
ism research because children and adults with more se-
vere difficulties are harder to recruit and retain in
research studies and, similarly, that families of children
with ID are harder to recruit as they may have less time
and resources [29]. There is also an issue around mental
capacity to consent to take part in research for some se-
verely affected individuals with ID, so for ethical reasons,
severely impaired individuals are excluded. ID is also a
spectrum, however, and the lack of capacity to consent
to research does not apply to everyone with ID. Another
reason for bias is that the field is lacking good instru-
ments to study people with intellectual disabilities [30].
Many research studies in the field of ID have examined
strategies to make research more inclusive [7, 31–35], and
there are reports and guides full of practical strategies and
references to other work [36–38]. Two useful systematic
reviews [39, 40] describe the barriers to cognitively
disabled individual participation in trials and public
health, and another review summarises the last 20 years of
research in this area [7]. Such work concludes that stra-
tegies to counter selection bias on ID require more time,
effort and funding to be put into recruitment. Strategies
include one-to-one meetings with participants to explain
study aims, enrolment and protocols [31]; piloting and
adaptation
of
measures
and
working
closely
with
gatekeepers (like service providers) to recruit potential
participants. Recruitment phases for populations with ID
should be longer than other populations, with researchers
prepared to make home visits and visit after hours to
allow for time constraints of participants and carers [32].
Being kept up-to-date with the progress of the research
projects was found to be an important part of engendering
a sense of personal benefit for participants [38].
Many carers experience overwhelming workloads and
exhaustion [41]. Carers (most often women [42]) often
have little time available for research or resources to
support participation in research activities. Respite care
for participants to give carers time off could be a strong
motivation to enable participation. Participants and
intermediaries
need
motivators
to
participate
in
research. A small payment to cover time and travel can
help, although can be viewed as coercive [33]. People
with ID living independently may also be recruited
through peer networks or advocacy movements (e.g. the
‘Academic Autism Spectrum Partnership in Research and
Education’ involves self-advocates). A strong self-advocacy
movement has been identified as one of the conditions ne-
cessary for inclusive research to flourish [43].
Obtaining consent for participants with ID can be
challenging and may require another person to give
consent on their behalf. This means going through gate-
keepers at services organisations, which should start at
the highest level [32]. Identification of key workers
within the organisations who may become allies to assist
researchers in recruitment is a helpful strategy [32].
There is a sub-group of autistic individuals who may
not be fluent verbally but are very able with technology
to express their needs and wants. Measures to allow
them access to research are developing rapidly as tech-
nology improves, for example measuring diet through
participants’ mobile photos of their food [44]. There are
many more people on the spectrum with ID who do not
speak but can use such devices and who can, therefore,
make their consent and needs for participating known.
Although many measures are not currently designed for
the population with very severe ID (such as standard IQ
tests), there are creative ways to adapt measures and
replicate similar constructs but using non-verbal tasks,
such
as
tests
of
spatial
intelligence
or
Adaptive
Behaviour Scales [45].
Impact of bias by ID
One consequence of the bias encountered is the lack of
an evidence base for effectiveness or otherwise of inter-
ventions, which have not specifically been trialled in
autistic individuals with intellectual disability. This has
implications for the introduction of a medication or a
specific behavioural therapy or new service. Forward cit-
ation chasing indicated that cognitive, psychological and
neuroscientific models of autism may be misapplied to
the ID group in ongoing research, when in reality, there
is no strong evidence base to support their application.
Similarly, a diagnostic test that has not been adequately
tested on the full population may under-identify the
autistic population with ID.
Not only does selection bias lead to inappropriate gen-
eralisation, but it may shift the boundaries around who
is included for an autism diagnosis. The evidence base
about a particular diagnostic category feeds back into
what we understand about it via revisions to diagnostic
criteria. Thus, the parameters of the category itself are
shifted if the research base predominantly contains per-
sons of one type. Autism is a case in point of such ‘loop-
ing’
, as it was once understood to be a condition
affecting very severely impaired children, but is now

 increasingly associated with non-ID individuals, inclu-
ding adults. Conceptually, autism can be thought of as a
collection of multi-dimensional traits that interact with
each other and the environment, and these traits may
alter with development. They are bounded together as a
diagnostic category based on the best current evidence
but also bounded for historical, pragmatic and political
reasons [46, 47]. If autism research is predominantly
drawn from studies of individuals without ID, this will
feedback into the evidence base and remodel how we
understand ‘autism’. This argument is applicable to all
psychiatric
diagnoses,
with
our
findings
specifically
drawing attention where intellectual disability is comor-
bid [48]. ADHD, psychotic disorder, anxiety disorder and
depression all co-occur with ID. Future research could
examine if such a bias exists more widely across other
psychiatric classes.
Strengths and limitations
Our review has a number of limitations. First, not all
autism research was sampled; we are aware that the
studies that include individuals with autism might also
appear in a variety of other types of journals that are not
specific to autism. These include the highest impact
journals (e.g. Nature). A systematic review was impracti-
cal as an initial scoping review threw up 30,000 hits.
Therefore, we simply did not have the capacity to mount
a systematic review that was an exhaustive study of all
papers relating to autism. This would have included the
journals that are specifically about ID (which we would
expect to be more balanced for ID and perhaps more
transparent in reporting).
A number of studies in our review excluded partici-
pants with ID, even though this was not apparent
from title screening. Morett et al. [49], for example,
operated an exclusion cut-off at 1 SD below mean IQ
(IQ < 85). However, even when we removed all studies
that deliberately excluded participants with ID, our
sensitivity analysis still revealed considerable bias, es-
timating a large preponderance of autistic participants
without ID.
In 2013, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Vol-
ume 5 (DSM-5) unified the diagnoses of autistic dis-
order, Asperger’s disorder and Pervasive Developmental
Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) into
‘autism spectrum disorder’. Our findings may partly re-
flect the response of the research community to this
change. It could be that selection bias towards autistic in-
dividuals with an IQ in the normal range is a relatively re-
cent phenomenon, as historically, estimates of population
of autistic people with ID were higher. Here, we were in-
terested in sampling the up-to-date (post-DSM-5) picture.
Further, it was not possible to report more detail on bias
by IQ or by severity of ID as a continuous measure as not
enough studies provided data. Nevertheless, this review is
the first (we know of) to comprehensively examine a
cross-section of autism research for bias by ID in a large
sample.
Recommendations
Our recommendation is to address barriers to research
participation for the ID group. We agree with Mulhall et
al.
that
studies
that
have
inclusive
strategies
for
recruitment should become a priority for research funders
along with that development of inclusive measures [40].
Researchers and academics can help by recommending
grants for funding only where broad inclusion strategies
to include participants with ID have been considered or
are in place. We suggest that exclusionary recruitment
strategies are acceptable, and may be necessary for prag-
matic reasons, but should be reported in a transparent
way in abstracts and titles and justified carefully in funding
applications, explaining why the protocol cannot be
modified to include those with ID.
Conclusion
Our study throws attention on a gap in the research lit-
erature for autistic people with ID, but the point could
be extended to other hard-to-reach populations, such as
people with complex comorbid mental health condi-
tions, severe ID or minimally verbal participants. Future
research might investigate whether such groups may be
largely absent from the evidence base for autism but also
neurodevelopmental conditions more widely, suggesting
what we know about a condition may largely reflect
groups who are easier to access.
The reporting
evidenced in
our
study
would
be
unproblematic if all autistic people shared the same
neurological profiles, genetic predisposition, aetiological
pathways,
cognitive
and
perceptual
differences
and
responses to intervention, but recent evidence suggests
this may not be the case [3, 5, 50]: it is difficult to find a
‘signal’ that is specific to one ‘autism’. There are real-world
implications if selection bias on ID occurs when partici-
pants’ intellectual ability is associated with the phenomena
under study. This may be the case for studies of interven-
tion, aetiology, service use, diagnosis, neuroscience and
psychology/cognitive functioning: all the sub-fields exam-
ined in this review.
