Summary
Background The obesity epidemic has major public health consequences. Expert dietetic and behavioural counselling 
with intensive follow-up is eff
 ective, but resource requirements severely restrict widespread implementation in 
primary care, where most patients are managed. We aimed to estimate the eff
 ectiveness and cost-eff
 ectiveness of an 
internet-based behavioural intervention (POWeR+) combined with brief practice nurse support in primary care.
Methods We did this pragmatic, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial at 56 primary care practices in central and 
south England. Eligible adults aged 18 years or older with a BMI of 30 kg/m² or more (or ≥28 kg/m² with hypertension, 
hypercholesterolaemia, or diabetes) registered online with POWeR+—a 24 session, web-based, weight management 
intervention lasting 6 months. After registration, the website automatically randomly assigned patients (1:1:1), via 
computer-generated random numbers, to receive evidence-based dietetic advice to swap foods for similar, but 
healthier, choices and increase fruit and vegetable intake, in addition to 6 monthly nurse follow-up (control group); 
web-based intervention and face-to-face nurse support (POWeR+Face-to-face [POWeR+F]; up to seven nurse contacts 
over 6 months); or web-based intervention and remote nurse support (POWeR+Remote [POWeR+R]; up to fi
 ve emails 
or brief phone calls over 6 months). Participants and investigators were masked to group allocation at the point of 
randomisation; masking of participants was not possible after randomisation. The primary outcome was weight loss 
averaged over 12 months. We did a secondary analysis of weight to measure maintenance of 5% weight loss at months 6 
and 12. We modelled the cost-eff
 ectiveness of each intervention. We did analysis by intention to treat, with multiple 
imputation for missing data. This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, 
number ISRCTN21244703.
Findings Between Jan 30, 2013, and March 20, 2014, 818 participants were randomly assigned to the control group 
(n=279), the POWeR+F group (n=269), or the POWeR+R group (n=270). Weight loss averaged over 12 months was 
recorded in 666 (81%) participants. The control group lost almost 3 kg over 12 months (crude mean weight: baseline 
104·38 kg [SD 21·11; n=279], 6 months 101·91 kg [19·35; n=136], 12 months 101·74 kg [19·57; n=227]). The primary 
imputed analysis showed that compared with the control group, patients in the POWeR+F group achieved an 
additional weight reduction of 1·5 kg (95% CI 0·6–2·4; p=0·001) averaged over 12 months, and patients in the 
POWeR+R group achieved an additional 1·3 kg (0·34–2·2; p=0·007). 21% of patients in the control group had 
maintained a clinically important 5% weight reduction at month 12, compared with 29% of patients in the POWeR+F 
group (risk ratio 1·56, 0·96–2·51; p=0·070) and 32% of patients in the POWeR+R group (1·82, 1·31–2·74; p=0·004). 
The incremental overall cost to the health service per kg weight lost with the POWeR+ interventions versus the 
control strategy was £18 (95% CI –129 to 195) for POWeR+F and –£25 (–268 to 157) for POWeR+R; the probability of 
being cost-eff
 ective at a threshold of £100 per kg lost was 88% and 98%, respectively. No adverse events were reported.
Interpretation Weight loss can be maintained in some individuals by use of novel written material with occasional 
brief nurse follow-up. However, more people can maintain clinically important weight reductions with a web-based 
behavioural program and brief remote follow-up, with no increase in health service costs. Future research should 
assess the extent to which clinically important weight loss can be maintained beyond 1 year.

Introduction
Obesity is a major threat to public health,1,2 the prevalence 
 
has risen sharply since the early 1990s,3 and most patients 
are managed in primary care.4 Systematic reviews,5 
including that from the National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence (NICE),4 advocate dietary and physical 
activity intervention supported by intensive behavioural 
techniques. The low availability of high-level dietetic and

behaviour-change expertise, and the little time available 
for counselling and follow-up, makes this approach 
challenging in the progressively resource-constrained 
primary care environment. A review6 of randomised 
controlled trials in primary care (excluding trials with 
more than 30% attrition at 12 months, which is common 
in studies of obesity) showed little evidence of appropriately 
intensive behavioural counselling and suggested trained 
interventionists.
One alternative to a cadre of highly trained inter-
ventionists is to harness the capacity of the internet to 
help support behaviour change. Reviews suggest that 
automated interactive web-based interventions without 
human input can achieve greater weight loss than does no 
treatment or minimal interventions, but the evidence base 
included too many small, short-term trials in volunteer 
samples, arguing the need for large, pragmatic trials with 
at least 1 year of follow-up and including assessments of 
cost-eff
 ectiveness.7,8 The trials identifi
 ed by NICE mostly 
had expert lifestyle and behavioural input, and followed 
up patients intensively—on average 13 times per year 
during the fi
 rst 12 months.4 NICE also estimated that any 
intervention costing £100 per kg lost was likely to be 
cost- eff
 ective if a 1 kg diff
 erence in weight was maintained 
for life. Automated interventions could be enhanced by 
human support, but although intensive support improves 
web-based weight management,9 we are aware of no 
studies examining the eff
 ectiveness of brief support by 
primary care staff
  that is likely to be both more feasible 
and cost-eff
 ective. A 2015 review10 identifi
 ed nine studies 
comparing internet support with minimal intervention, 
but two studies had unusual populations (university staff
 ; 
lactating women), and the only study to report fewer than 
ten contacts by behavioural counsellors documented less 
than 1·5 kg of weight loss and high attrition at 12 months, 
with only 49% of individuals followed up.
We did the POWeR+ trial to estimate the eff
 ectiveness 
and cost-eff
 ectiveness of a web-based behavioural weight 
management intervention (POWeR+) with either brief 
face-to-face nurse support or brief remote nurse support 
for obese patients managed in primary care. 
Methods
Study design and patients
We did this pragmatic, parallel-group, randomised 
controlled trial at 56 primary care practices in central and 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We did not repeat the most recent systematic review, done by 
Hutchesson and colleagues, which included studies of adults 
aged 18 years or older that assessed weight loss or weight 
maintenance interventions with an e-Health component. 
Between 1995, and Sept 17, 2014, Hutchesson and colleagues 
searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and PreMEDLINE, 
Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and 
PsycINFO. Search terms were obesity/ or obesity, abdominal/ or

 ed as 
higher quality (quality and risk of bias), 57 (67·9%) studies were 
classifi
 ed as moderate quality, and nine (10·7%) studies were 
lower quality. Meta-analysis showed signifi
 cantly greater 
weight loss (kg) with e-Health interventions than with minimal 
interventions (mean diff
 erence −1·40, 95% CI −1·98 to −0·82; 
p<0·001). However, two studies had unusual populations 
(university staff
 ; lactating women), and the only study to report 
fewer than ten contacts by behavioural counsellors 
documented less than 1·5 kg weight loss and high attrition at 
12 months, with only 49% of individuals followed up. Thus, 
evidence for the eff
 ectiveness of internet interventions using 
brief behavioural support in a primary care setting is poor.
Added value of this study
Our results show that clinically important weight reduction is 
possible with a web-based behavioural program lasting 
6 months combined with brief remote follow-up. Patients 
assigned to the web-based intervention and either face-to-face 
nurse support (POWeR+Face-to-face) or remote nurse support 
(POWeR+Remote) achieved roughly 1·5 kg more weight loss 
than those assigned to the control group (evidence-based 
dietetic advice and 6 monthly nurse follow-up). Furthermore, 
30% of patients in the POWeR+ groups maintained 5% weight 
loss by 12 months, with less recourse to other weight loss 
activities and with no increase in health service costs.
Implications of all the available evidence
The weight loss achieved with POWeR+ was similar to that 
achieved with the best performing interventions evaluated in a 
primary care setting over a 12 month period, including those 
produced by face-to-face commercial programmes. When 
combined with very brief staff
  support, the POWeR+ program 
could be feasibly used in most practices and could make a 
clinically important contribution to the management of obesity. 
Future research should assess the extent to which clinically 
important weight loss can be maintained beyond 1 year.

south England (around Southampton and Oxford). Up to 
100 patients from each practice were randomly chosen, by 
use of computer-generated numbers, and invited to a 
screening appointment. Patients could also be referred 
opportunistically from routine practice appointments.
We enrolled individuals aged 18 years or older with a BMI 
of 30 kg/m² or more (or ≥28 kg/m² with hypertension, 
hypercholesterolaemia, or diabetes) as identifi
 ed from 
general practitioner (GP) routine electronic health records. 
We excluded patients with severe mental health problems 
(eg, psychosis; diffi
  culty completing outcomes), patients 
who were too ill to take part in a study such as this one or 
who were unable to change their diet (eg, individuals 
with severe heart, lung, kidney, bowel, or liver diseases), 
patients who were pregnant or breastfeeding, patients 
with a perceived inability to walk 100 m (physical activity 
diffi
  cult), and patients with another member of the 
household taking part or no regular access to the internet. 
The study was approved by the National Research Ethics 
Service Committee South Central—Southampton B 
(reference 11/SC/0455). All participants provided written 
informed consent.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were given details of how to log in and register to 
the POWeR+ intervention, whereupon individuals were 
presented with baseline questionnaires. Upon completion 
of the questionnaires, the website automatically randomly 
assigned patients (1:1:1), via computer-generated random 
numbers, to one of three intervention groups: evidence-
based dietetic advice and 6 monthly nurse follow-up 
(control group); web-based intervention and face-to-face 
nurse support (POWeR+Face-to-face [POWeR+F] group); 
or 
web-based 
intervention 
and 
remote 
support 
(POWeR+Remote [POWeR+R group]). Participants and 
investigators were masked to group allocation at the 
point of randomisation; masking of participants was not 
possible after randomisation. The 12 month weight 
measurement was masked whenever possible.
Procedures
POWeR+ is a theory and evidence-based intervention to 
teach patients self-regulation and cognitive-behavioural 
techniques to form sustainable eating and physical activity 
habits for long-term weight management in a series of 
24 web-based sessions designed to be used over 6 months, 
with novel content, links to external content, and email 
reminders. Patients initially chose either a low-calorie or a 
low-carbohydrate eating plan, but could change plans at 
any stage if they wished (appendix pp 1–4).
Participants assigned to the control group were directed 
to a set of two printable web-based pages with brief 
structured advice. This intervention was active, since it was 
intended to aid weight loss. The materials were developed 
by the Institute of Food Research to provide appealing 
strategies to minimise the pressure to cut down favourite 
foods, and to instead swap less healthy foods for healthier 
choices (healthy foods swap sheet), or to increase fruit and 
vegetable intake (we used the National Health Service 
[NHS] fi
 ve-a-day sheet). Our previous trial11 documented 
1·2 kg weight loss at 6 months when patients with 
hypertension received prompt sheets promoting healthy 
eating compared with a generic advice booklet. To enhance 
retention, participants were informed that this intervention 
had been shown to support weight loss. Nurses arranged 
brief follow-up (5–10 min appointments) with suffi
  cient 
time to measure weight at 6 months and 12 months, but 
not to provide explicit counselling.
The aim of the POWeR+F intervention was to provide 
automated behavioural counselling, with just three 
scheduled (and four optional) face-to-face nurse support 
sessions, thus requiring substantially less health 
professional skill and time than the evidence-based 
lifestyle interventions documented in the NICE review,4 
and hence being much easier to implement in the NHS. 
In addition to weight recording every 6 months, as in the 
control group, participants had three scheduled face-to-
face appointments in the fi
 rst 3 months, and then up to 
four more appointments during a further 3 months if 
needed (ie, 6 months in total). Weight gain on two 
consecutive logins triggered an automated email to the 
nurse advising that the patient needed further support, 
or patients could request additional support.
The aim of the POWeR+R intervention was to assess 
whether even briefer professional support for the web 
intervention could be eff
 ective. Patients could access the 
same web-based intervention as in the POWeR+F group. 
In addition to weight recording every 6 months, as in the 
control group, participants had three scheduled phone or 
email contacts and up to two optional phone or email 
contacts in the fi
 rst 6 months (triggered by weight gain 
or patient request, as in the POWeR+F group).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was weight loss averaged over 
12 months. Weight loss was measured with participants 
lightly clothed without shoes, at the same time every day 
when possible, with automated digital scales (Tanita Europe 
BV, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Piloting suggested that 
intensive follow-up for anything but the primary outcome 
would increase dropout, we therefore focused on weight. 
As such, the fi
 nal analysis plan (July 1, 2015), matching the 
clinical rationale for our original sample size, included a 
secondary analysis of weight—maintenance of 5% weight 
loss. This outcome is very important clinically,12,13 and 
facilitated direct comparison with a previous UK primary 
care trial14 published after our study commenced. Although 
there was no explicit measurement of the work of 
participants (ie, how much time was spent doing the 
intervention activities), other secondary outcomes included 
health service resource use, use of the website (pages 
accessed and time taken, recorded automatically by the 
website), how enabled patients felt (measured with the 
modifi
 ed Patient Enablement Instrument15), and any

additional activities participants used to help lose weight. We 
also documented various other secondary outcomes (waist 
measurement, blood pressure, HbA1c, liver function tests, 
self-reported measures of physical activity, and diet; appendix 
p 11). We planned to use Actiheart monitors in a randomised 
subset of individuals, but organising this method at a time 
of intensive fi
 nal follow-up became too diffi
  cult.
Participants had appointments for weight measurement 
with the practice nurse at baseline and 6 months, and an 
appointment or home visit by a nurse researcher masked 
to group allocation at 12 months. When a blinded weight 
measurement could not be obtained, we used practice 
nurses’ recorded weights, and when that was not possible, 
we used participants’ reported weights. Participants 
received a £10 gift voucher with the 12 month 
appointment notifi
 cation letter as a thank you for 
participation, irrespective of whether an appointment 
was made. For self-reported measures, participants 
received three emails prompting online completion 
followed by a postal version of the questionnaire.
Statistical analysis
On Sept 25, 2013, the Trial Steering Committee advised 
an increase to the sample size to allow for clustering; this 
amendment required an extension to the planned 
recruitment period.
We allowed all groups to be compared with each other 
(α 0·05/3=0·017), but for the primary analysis compared 
each intervention group with the control group. For the 
primary outcome, we estimated that a standardised 
eff
 ect size of 0·33 (equivalent to 2–3 kg diff
 erence 
assuming 
a 
standard 
deviation 
of 
change 
of 
6·5–7·5 kg16,17), and 80% power, required 174 patients per 
group with complete data or 654 patients in total, 
allowing for a 20% loss to follow-up. After liaison with 
both the funder of the study and the Trial Steering 
Committee, the power calculation was revised on 
Sept 25, 2013, to allow for modest clustering at practice 
level if signifi
 cant clustering was recorded. We assumed 
recruitment of 18 patients per practice to achieve 
15 patients at follow-up, of whom roughly fi
 ve to six 
patients would be in each of the two intervention groups 
at follow-up. Assuming fi
 ve patients per group in each 
practice for an intracluster correlation of 0·05—ie, a 
design eff
 ect of 1·2 (1 + [(5–1) × 0·05])—resulted in a 
minimum of 654 × 1·2=785 patients.
To avoid loss of data, on July 1, 2015, repeated measures 
ANOVA for the principal continuous outcome (ie, 
weight) was changed to mixed multivariate regression 
models to enable data to be used from any participant 
who had 6 months’ or 12 months’ data. We modelled the 
risk ratios compared with the control group for the 
number of patients achieving 5% weight loss. All 
regression models controlled for weight at baseline, sex, 
age, smoking, diabetes, medications (including orlistat 
used at baseline), any comorbidities, deprivation (Index 
of Material Deprivation 2010), and any clustering by 
practice. No interim analyses were undertaken.

50 replications). Secondary analyses used both complete 
cases and measured weights.
We explored whether there was signifi
 cant eff
 ect 
modifi
 cation in subgroups using interaction terms in the 
models. Key pre-identifi
 ed subgroups were baseline waist 
measurement (high or very high waist vs low waist; men: 
high 94 cm, very high 102 cm; women: high 80 cm, very 
high 88 cm), and presence of metabolic syndrome 
(syndrome vs no syndrome). Metabolic syndrome18 was 
defi
 ned as the presence of three out of fi
 ve conditions: 
elevated waist circumference (>94 cm for men, 80 cm for 
women), triglyceride concentrations of 1·7 mmol/L or 
more, reduced HDL-cholesterol (<1·00 mmol/L in men, 
<1·3 mmol/L in women), raised blood pressure (systolic 
>130 mm Hg or diastolic >85 mm Hg, or treatment of 
high blood pressure), and elevated fasting glucose 
(≥5·6 mmol/L).18 We also explored outcomes according to 
the type of diet chosen by patients.
We obtained data for health service resource use from 
case-note review of medication, primary care visits, 
outpatient consultant, obesity-related admissions to 
accident 
and 
emergency 
and 
hospital 
(eg, 
for 
management of obesity and disorders aff
 ected by obesity, 
such as cardiovascular disease, control of asthma, and 
musculoskeletal problems [hip, back, and knee]; 
appendix pp 5–8). For the cost-eff
 ectiveness analysis, we 
measured outcomes as incremental costs per kg weight 
loss; we imputed missing data and used bootstrapping 
methods to produce confi
 dence intervals. We did analysis 
with Stata (version 14).
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data interpretation, data analysis, or writing of 
the report. The corresponding author had full access to 
all the data in the study and had fi
 nal responsibility for 
the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Figure 1 shows the trial profi
 le. Between Jan 30, 2013, and 
March 20, 2014, 826 patients underwent randomisation. 
After exclusion of eight participants identifi
 ed as ineligible 
post-randomisation, 818 individuals were randomly 
assigned to the control group (n=279), the POWeR+F 
group (n=269), or the POWeR+R (n=270). 439 (54%) 
patients had a weight recorded at 6 months’ follow-up and 
666 (81%) patients had a weight recorded at 12 months. 
510 (77%) of the 666 recordings were blinded, 28 (4%) were 
unblinded, and 128 (19%) were self-reported. The number 
of self-reported measurements was similar between 
groups (control n=40, POWeR+F n=48, POWeR+R n=40). 
Baseline characteristics were generally well balanced 
(table 1). The practice intracluster correlation for weight in 
the repeated measures analysis was 0·01 (95% CI 
0·003–0·09) when controlling for baseline weight.
Of the 539 participants randomised to the POWeR+ 
intervention groups, 524 (97%) participants started the fi
 rst 
session and 404 (75%) participants completed all three core 
sessions (n=208 in the POWeR+F group and n=196 in the 
POWeR+R group). Participants completed a mean of 10·97 
(SD 12·65) weight and goal reviews (range zero to 52), with 
a mean of 10·16 (11·92) completed reviews in the 
POWeR+F group and 11·85 (13·38) in the POWeR+R 
group. The median number of nurse contacts was four 
(range zero to seven) in both intervention groups, with a 
median of two (IQR one to three) face-to-face contacts, one 
(zero to two) phone contact, and one (zero to two) email 
contact in the POWeR+F group, and a median of one (zero 
to two) phone contact and three (two to four) email contacts 
in the POWeR+R group. We recorded a 2–2·5 kg diff
 erence 
in weight reduction for participants who completed more 
than the fi
 rst basic stage of the program.
Patients in the control group maintained a weight loss 
of almost 3 kg in total over 12 months (table 2). The 
primary imputed analysis showed that compared with the 
control group, patients in the POWeR+F group achieved 
an estimated additional 1·5 kg reduction averaged over 
12 months and patients in the POWeR+R group achieved 
an additional 1·3 kg reduction (table 3). A secondary 
analysis of only the complete cases showed a greater 
weight reduction at 12 months in the intervention groups 
than in the control group (POWeR+F: –1·78 kg, 95% CI 
–2·81 to –0·76; p=0·001; POWeR+R: –1·6 kg, –2·6 to –0·6; 
p=0·002; appendix pp 9, 10).

was 19% in the control group, 28% in the POWeR+F 
group, and 32% in the POWeR+R group; the imputed 
estimates were 21%, 29%, and 32%, respectively (table 4).
We reviewed 753 case notes from the GP electronic 
health records for 12 months after recruitment. Mean 
intervention costs were low both per person using the 
services (£22 [95% CI 21–23] for POWeR+F and £12 
[11–13] for POWeR+R) and for all participants in each 
group (£17 [15–18] and £9 [8–10], respectively). Addition of 
the estimated cost of the website raised the overall costs 
for all participants to £18 [95% CI 16–19] in the POWeR+F 
group and £10 [9–11] in the POWeR+R group. We 
recorded greater diff
 erences in overall costs for estimated 
overall NHS resource use related to obesity in the 
intervention versus the control groups (appendix pp 7, 8). 
Bootstrapping analysis showed that diff
 erences in costs 
compared with the control group were £23 for POWeR+F 
and –£36 for POWeR+R; neither of these diff
 erences 
was statistically signifi
 cant (table 5). The estimated 
incremental overall NHS cost per kg weight loss was £18 
for POWeR+F and –£25 for POWeR+R (table 5)—ie, 
POWeR+R was more eff
 ective and cost less than the 
control strategy. The probability of cost-eff
 ectiveness was 
more than 80% in cost-eff
 ectiveness acceptability curves 
for both POWeR+F and POWeR+R versus control (88% 
and 98%, respectively; appendix pp 8, 9).
For patients returning the fi
 nal questionnaire, almost 
half the people in the control group were doing additional 
activities, compared with almost two-fi
 fths in the 
POWeR+F group and only a quarter in the POWeR+R 
group (table 6). Participants in the intervention groups 
also felt more enabled to manage their weight problem 
than did those in the control group (table 6).
Due to the priority to obtain follow-up data for weight, 
and the clear feedback from piloting suggesting that 
pressurising participants to have blood taken was off
 -
putting, achievement of high follow-up for blood samples 
was necessarily a secondary priority; therefore, only a 
small number of participants had follow-up blood 
measurements. The available results suggest generally 
positive directions of outcomes in the POWeR+ groups 
versus the control group, although changes were mostly 
non-signifi
 cant (raised HDL cholesterol, lower aspartate 
transaminase and alanine transaminase, lower HbA1C; 
appendix pp 12–14). The low completion rate of the 
EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire reduces the reliability 
of these data; as such, the direction of change in EQ-5D 
scores is diffi
  cult to interpret, particularly because the 
estimate of direction of change varies dependent on 
whether we controlled for baseline values (appendix p 18).
Body fat percentage and blood pressure were recorded 
in most participants at follow-up (n=454 and n=494, 
respectively), and although there were no consistent 
changes in blood pressure in any of the three groups, fat 
mass was slightly reduced at 12 months in both POWeR+ 
groups (appendix p 15).
In subgroup analysis, we recorded some evidence of a 
reduced eff
 ect of the POWeR+F group at 6 months in 
patients with metabolic syndrome, but no signifi
 cant 
eff
 ect of type of diet chosen (appendix p 9). No harms 
were reported during the study
Discussion
This study is one of few to compare simple weight 
management interventions using primary care staff
  for 
support to manage obesity. Clinically important weight 
loss (5% reduction) was achieved by some participants in 
the control group, and the crude mean weight reduction 
by 12 months was not signifi
 cantly lower in the POWeR+ 
behavioural web-based intervention groups. However, in 
the POWeR+ groups, signifi
 cantly more weight loss 
occurred over 12 months, and more participants 
maintained clinically important weight reduction and felt 
enabled to manage their weight. This outcome was 
achieved with no increase in health service costs despite 
brief nurse remote support.
Individuals who take part in trials are likely to be fairly 
well motivated, but participants are also the intended 
target group in whom intervention is likely to be most 
helpful. The present study was large and pragmatic,

mimicking the everyday conditions in primary care 
settings; therefore, patients in the control group were not 
closely regulated and so undertook other activities to lose 
weight. However, this factor is also a strength because 
resulting estimates are more refl
 ective of real-world 
practice. Participants with obesity in primary care settings 
are notoriously diffi
  cult to follow up, but we achieved 
follow-up of more than 80% of individuals at 12 months. 
Loss to follow-up was similar between groups, which 
reduces the eff
 ect of missing data. Furthermore, we 
imputed data for the primary analysis, thus providing 
more conservative estimates of eff
 ectiveness than 
complete cases. However, in practice, multiple imputation 
modifi
 ed the estimates only slightly, which suggests that 
attrition bias was not a major issue. On the basis of the 
experience of piloting, whereby pressure to achieve 
follow-up of both primary and secondary outcomes 
resulted in participants dropping out, our eff
 orts were 
concentrated on maximising the primary outcome, which 
resulted in fewer secondary outcomes being available. As 
a result, even though estimates used multiple imputation, 
the results for blood samples should be interpreted 
cautiously. Nevertheless, we recorded signifi
 cant weight 
loss irrespective of the method of specifying the weight 
outcome (average reduction over 12 months as specifi
 ed 
in the funding application, or clinically important [5%] 
weight loss at 6 months or 12 months), and most 
secondary outcomes also changed in positive directions, 
albeit mostly not signifi
 cantly, suggesting that selective 
reporting and type I error are less likely.
In the control group, we observed 3% loss in weight, and 
12% and 19% of participants in this group maintained a 
clinically important weight loss (5%) at 6 and 12 months, 
respectively. These results are consistent with our previous 
fi
 ndings,11 showing that a brief intervention promoting the 
use of simple sheets for food swaps and fi
 ve-a-day fruit and 
vegetable consumption aids weight control. Some of the 
eff
 ective weight management in this group might also be 
due to the motivational eff
 ects of regular follow-up 
weighing by the nurse, and to the undertaking of additional 
activities to help themselves (which about half of 
participants did). By contrast, fewer individuals off
 ered the 
POWeR+ interventions undertook other activities, and they 
felt signifi
 cantly more enabled to manage their weight.
Systematic reviews4,6,19 of interventions in other settings 
and primary care suggest that both intensive dietetic 
behavioural counselling and intensive follow-up are 
usually necessary to achieve eff
 ective weight reduction. 
However, we found that a behavioural web-based 
intervention such as POWeR+ was eff
 ective with just a 
few brief phone calls and emails, plus weight monitoring 
every 6 months. The weight loss achieved with POWeR+ 
compares 
favourably 
with 
other 
internet-based 
interventions, which, on average (albeit with high 
heterogeneity), have led to only short-term weight loss, of 
less than 1 kg weight loss compared with no treatment, or 
less than 2 kg when combined with face-to-face support, 
based on a review of predominantly motivated volunteer 
samples.20 Improved weight loss (around 5 kg) with an 
internet-based program has only been achieved with 
much more intensive human support (eg, weekly 20 min 
contact for 12 weeks, and then monthly up to 24 month 
follow-up9). Encouragingly, the weight loss achieved with 
POWeR+ was similar to that achieved with the best-
performing interventions21 evaluated over 12 months in a 
primary care setting, including those produced by face-to-
face commercial programmes.
The estimates of resource use suggest that neither 
intervention was resource intensive. Considering overall 
NHS costs, fewer NHS resources were used in the 
POWeR+R group, mainly due to reduced primary care 
costs. In view of the variability of cost estimates, these 
results should be treated with some caution, but health 
service costs are unlikely to be signifi
 cantly increased with 
the remote POWeR+ intervention. We also recorded that 
POWeR+ users felt signifi
 cantly more enabled to manage 
their condition, so if individuals can be enabled to manage

their own condition without needing signifi
 cant face-to-
face contact, this could empower self-management more 
generally. Previous modelling by NICE showed that at least 
a 1 kg per head weight loss among overweight or obese 
adults is likely to be cost- eff
 ective, provided that the cost 
per person of intervening is less than £100 and the weight 
diff
 erence is maintained for life. The present results 
suggests that irrespective of whether intervention costs or 
overall costs are used, both POWeR+ interventions achieve 
weight losses at a cost per kg that is less that required by 
NICE.4 The POWeR+ intervention was for 6 months, but 
the number of patients maintaining clinically important 
weight loss remained steady up to 1 year, which suggests 
that long-term benefi
 t could be achieved. However, future 
research should assess the extent to which clinically 
important weight loss can be maintained beyond 1 year.
