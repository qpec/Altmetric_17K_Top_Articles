Abstract 
This study examined changes in countermovement jump (CMJ) height after an 
intermittent or a continuous static stretching protocol of equal total duration. Design: Sixteen 
male, elite-level gymnasts performed 90 s of intermittent (3 x 30 s with 30 s rest) or 
continuous stretching (90 s) of the quadriceps muscle. A single-leg stretching and jumping 
design was used, with the contra-lateral limb serving as a control. The same individuals 
performed both conditions with alternate legs in a randomized, counterbalanced order. One leg 
CMJ height was measured for the stretched and the control leg after warm-up, immediately 
after stretching, and at regular intervals for 10 min after stretching. Range of motion (ROM) 
of the hip and knee joints was measured before, after, and 10 min post-stretching. Compared 
to the control leg, intermittent stretching increased CMJ height by 8.1±2.0%, 4 min into 
recovery (+2.2±2.0 cm, 95%CI: 1.0-3.4 cm, p=0.001), while continuous stretching decreased 
CMJ height by 17.5±3.3% immediately after (-2.9±1.7 cm, 95%CI: -2.0 to -3.7 cm, p=0.001) 
and by 12.0±2.7% one min after stretching (-2.2±2.1 cm, 95%CI: -1.2 to -3.2 cm, p=0.001). 
The increases in hip (2.9 and 3.6o, p=0.001. d=2.4) and knee joint ROM (5.1 and 6.1o, 
p=0.001. d=0.85) after the intermittent and continuous stretching protocols were not different. 
The opposite effects of intermittent vs. continuous stretching on subsequent CMJ performance 
suggests that stretching mode is an important variable when examining the acute effects of 
static stretching on performance in flexibility-trained athletes.

INTRODUCTION 
Over the past two decades a substantial body of research has demonstrated that 
prolonged static stretching (total duration ˃ 60 s) reduces the ability of muscles to generate 
power, and that performance reductions may persist for several minutes or hours post stretch 
(1,5,34). This stretch-induced force and power loss has been attributed to neuromuscular 
inhibition, and decreased muscle-tendon stiffness due to alterations of the viscoelastic 
properties of the musculotendinous unit (1,15,21). Based on this evidence, it has been 
recommended to avoid static stretching before exercise requiring rapid force production (34), 
and several coaches have reduced or abandoned static stretching as part of the warm-up and 
replaced it with dynamic stretching (18). 
Interestingly, previous cross-sectional studies using professional and national level 
athletes (10) reported no stretch induced deficit on sprint, agility and jumping ability 
following an acute bout of static stretching. Therefore, the effect of static stretching on 
performance may depend on the training background of the subjects (22,30). More 
importantly, there are studies that either failed to detect impairments in muscle performance 
after static stretching (10,23), or even reported enhancement of muscle power during sprint or 
jumping tests, provided that the duration of the stretching bouts were brief (<30 s) (2,3). Such 
brief stretching durations are more realistic in the sporting environment, since a typical warm-
up routine in most sports includes 1-3 sets of shorter duration stretches (10-30 s) interspersed 
with rest intervals of equal duration while the contra-lateral limb is being stretched (33). 
Therefore, in training practice, short-duration stretches are applied to each limb in an 
intermittent fashion and further research is required to determine how this might influence 
subsequent performance. This is even more important to be examined in well trained athletes 
who regularly apply stretching routines during training and competition.

Although previous findings support total static stretching duration as an important 
determinant of the magnitude of stretch-induced muscle performance decrements (6,19,20), 
there is limited evidence of whether this depends on if stretching is applied in an intermittent 
or a continuous fashion (20,34). Trajano, et al. (36) compared an intermittent (5 x 1-min 
stretches) with a continuous stretching protocol of the same total duration (i.e., 5 min) and 
reported that intermittent stretching induced a greater reduction of torque production (-23.8% 
versus -14.3%), electromyographic (EMG) activity (-27.1% versus -7.9%), and voluntary 
activation (-15.9% only after intermittent stretching). Once again, however, the total 
stretching duration used in this study was much greater than what is commonly used in 
training practice (6,20). Thus, the purpose of the present study was to examine changes in 
lower-limb explosive performance after two static stretching protocols of equal stretching 
time (90 s), performed in either an intermittent (3 x 30-s) or a continuous manner (1 x 90-s), 
in flexibility-trained athletes. 
 
METHODS 
Experimental approach to the problem 
To investigate the time course of the effect of stretching on jump height, a single-leg 
stretching and jumping design was used, with the contra-lateral limb serving as control, while 
the same individuals performed both conditions (intermittent and continuous stretching) with 
alternate legs on two separate randomly assigned occasions. It was hypothesized that these 
two stretching protocols would have different effects on jump performance. Following one 
familiarization session, subjects performed two experimental sessions. On the first visit, 
anthropometric measurements were taken and they were familiarised with the testing 
procedures. On the next two visits, the two main experimental sessions took place one week 
apart at the same time of day (10:00 a.m.). In one experimental session (intermittent protocol)

the stretching protocol included 3 static stretches of 30 s of one leg, with a 30-s rest interval in 
between, while the other leg served as a control and received no stretching treatment. In the 
other experimental session, the leg used as the control in the previous visit received the 
stretching treatment (i.e. one 90-s bout of continuous stretching - continuous protocol), with 
the other leg serving as a control. The order of the stretching treatment (intermittent or 
continuous) and the order of the legs (right and left) was randomized and counterbalanced. In 
both experimental sessions, countermovement jump (CMJ) performance of the stretched and 
control legs were measured by a single, one-leg CMJ at the following time-points: 
immediately (10-15 s) after warm-up, immediately (10-15 s) after stretching, and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 
6, 8 and 10 min after stretching. Range of motion (ROM) of the hip and knee joints of the 
stretched leg was measured by two experienced examiners using the modified Thomas test 
immediately after warm-up, immediately after, and 10 min following stretching. ROM of the 
hip and knee joints of the control leg was also measured after the warm up and following the 
last CMJ. 
Subjects 
Sixteen elite male gymnasts, members of the national team (age: 24 ± 4 y, age range: 
19-30 y, training experience: 18 ± 4 y, height: 166 ± 5 cm, body mass: 64 ± 5 kg) took part in 
this study. They were free of injury and were training six days a week, twice per day 
(approximately 36 hours/week). They gave informed consent to participate in the study, after a 
thorough explanation of the testing protocol, the possible risks involved, and the right to 
terminate participation at will. The study was approved by the University’s Institutional 
Review Board (2254/10-6-2015). All procedures were in accordance with the Helsinki 
declaration of 1964, as revised in 2013.

Procedures 
Prior to each experimental session a standardized warm-up was performed, including 5 
min of jogging at a moderate intensity (50-60% of age-predicted maximal heart rate). The 
training load for the week preceding each main session was recorded and kept similar, while 
subjects were instructed to have a light training session 24 h prior to performing each main 
experimental session. 
Static stretching procedure. 
The stretching movement of the modified Thomas test (hip extension combined with 
knee flexion while lying on a plinth, with force applied by an investigator) was used to stretch 
the hip flexor and knee extensor muscles of one leg to the point of discomfort (Fig. 1). This 
maneuver stretches the knee extensors that significantly contribute to one-leg jump, such as 
the vastus lateralis and the bi-articular rectus femoris muscles (8), as well as hip flexors that 
are not directly involved in jumping, such as the iliopsoas muscle. The intensity of the 
stretching was adjusted based on feedback from the subject to ensure the stretch subjectively 
achieved 90% of the point of discomfort, where 0 represents “no stretch discomfort” and 
100% the “maximum imaginable stretch discomfort” (7,40). The static stretching protocols 
were applied and controlled by the same strength and conditioning researcher. Subjects were 
familiar with this stretching movement as they performed it regularly in their daily flexibility 
programs. 
Range of motion measurement 
Range of motion (ROM) of the hip and knee joints of the stretched leg was measured 
using the modified Thomas test (Fig. 1) immediately after warm-up, immediately after and 10 
min following stretching. ROM of the hip and knee joints of the control leg was also measured 
after the warm up and following the last CMJ, in order to avoid the possible influence of static

stretching on CMJ performance. Subjects sat at the edge of a plinth, then rolled back and lay 
supine holding the knee of the non-tested leg to the chest with the arms placed around the 
tibia, so that the lumbar spine was flat on the table. To avoid pelvic tilt, subjects’ hips were 
firmly strapped on the physiotherapy bed (Fig. 1). The leg under testing was lowered down 
towards the floor with force progressively applied by an experienced examiner, to induce hip 
hyperextension and knee flexion, up to the point that each subject could tolerate (point of 
discomfort). Το calculate hip and knee ROM, reflective motion analysis markers were placed 
on the following anatomical marks: hip (trochanterion), knee (femur-tibia joint line) and ankle 
(lateral malleolus). The position of the markers was recorded using a digital camera (Casio 
Exilim Pro EX-F1) placed perpendicular to the plane of motion of the leg, and knee and hip 
angles were calculated as follows (Kinovea Video Analysis Software, v.0.8.15): 
(a) hip extension ROM, i.e. the angle between the horizontal and the line joining the hip 
and knee markers 
(b) knee flexion ROM, i.e. the range of movement of the shank around the knee joint, 
from an extended knee position (straight knee= 0o) 
 
Measurement of single leg CMJ performance 
One leg CMJ performance was assessed according to the protocol of Bosco et al. (1983) 
by measuring flight time from force plate data. Participants were asked to bend their knee to 
approximately 90 degrees, and to take off until hip, knee and ankle were fully extended, and 
then land in the same spot keeping their hands on their hips throughout the entire jump. Two 
CMJs separated by 30 s of rest were performed at baseline, while only one CMJ was 
performed at each recovery time point. In both experimental sessions, CMJ performance of 
the stretched and the control legs were measured (Ergojump, Psion XP, MA.GI.CA, Rome, 
Italy) at the following time-points: immediately (10-15 s) after warm-up, immediately (10-15

s) after stretching and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10 min after stretching. Subjects rested while 
standing between CMJ efforts. 
STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics Version 23). To 
examine the differences in CMJ height a 3-way repeated measures analysis of variance (2 x 2 
x 9, ANOVA) was used: leg (2 conditions: stretched vs. control) x stretching protocol (2 
conditions: intermittent vs. continuous) x time (9 time points). ROM of the hip and knee joints 
were examined with separate 2 x 2 two-way repeated measures ANOVA for the control leg (2 
testing conditions x 2 time points) and the stretched leg (2 testing conditions x 3 time points), 
due to the fact that ROM in the control leg was measured only at baseline and after the last 
CMJ, in order to avoid the possible influence of static stretching on CMJ performance in the 
control condition. When a significant main effect or interaction was observed (p<0.05) a 
Tukey’s post–hoc test was performed. Effect sizes (ES) were determined by partial eta 
squared (η2) (small: 0.01 to 0.059, moderate: 0.06 to 0.137, large >0.138). For pairwise 
comparisons, ES was determined by Cohen’s d (small: <0.2, medium: >0.2-0.5, large: >0.8). 
Test-retest reliability for all dependent variables was assessed by calculating the intraclass 
correlation coefficient (ICC) using a two-way random effect model. Additionally, the standard 
error of measurements (SEM) was calculated as the square root of the mean square error term 
from the ANOVA and was expressed both as an absolute value and as a percentage of the 
participants’ mean scores (coefficient of variation, CV) (38). Data are presented as 
mean±standard deviation and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).

RESULTS 
There was a 3-way interaction of leg x stretching protocol x time (p<0.0001, η2=0.25). 
As shown in Fig. 2 (left panel), the intermittent stretching protocol resulted in an increase in 
CMJ from the 2nd until the 8th minute of recovery compared with baseline, that peaked 4 min 
after stretching (+3.8±1.5 cm, 95%CI=+3.1 to +4.5 cm, p=0.0001, Cohen's d=1.3). In contrast, 
the continuous stretching protocol resulted in a decrease in CMJ performance immediately 
after (-2.5±1.0 cm, 95%CI= -2.0 to -3.0 cm, p=0.0001, Cohen's d=0.9) and 1 min after 
stretching (-1.5±1.0 cm, 95%CI= -0.9 to -2.1 cm, p=0.049, Cohen's d=0.5), followed by an 
increase above baseline 6 min into recovery (+1.7±1.0 cm, 95%CI=+1.2 to +2.2 cm, 
p=0.001;Cohen's d=0.6; see Fig. 2, left panel). Comparison of the CMJ values between the 
two stretching protocols at corresponding time points revealed higher scores during the first 4 
min of recovery following the intermittent protocol compared with the continuous protocol 
(Fig. 2, left panel). 
For the non-stretched leg (control) CMJ was gradually increased on each subsequent 
jump from baseline up to the 4th min of recovery (1.6±1.3 cm, 95%CI = +1.0 to +2.3 cm, 
p=0.001, Cohen's d=0.6; Fig. 2, right panel). Post-hoc comparisons revealed that following 
intermittent stretching, CMJ was 8.1±2.0% higher compared with the control leg at the 4th 
minute of recovery (+2.2±2.0 cm, 95%CI = +1.0 to +3.4 cm, p=0.001, Cohen's d=0.7; see Fig. 
2, left panel). In contrast, after the continuous stretching protocol, CMJ was 12.0±2.7 to 
17.5±3.3% lower for the stretched compared with the control leg immediately after (-2.9±1.7 
cm, 95%CI=-2.0 to -3.7 cm, p=0.001, Cohen's d=0.9) and 1 min after stretching (-2.2±2.1 cm, 
95%CI=-1.2 to -3.2 cm, p=0.001, Cohen's d=0.8; Fig. 2, left panel). The test-retest reliability 
of single leg CMJ performance was high (ICC=0.965, p<0.01; SEM=0.62 cm; CV=3.1%; p 
value of ANOVA= 0.69) as determined in a separate session.

Hip and knee ROM of the control leg remained unchanged during both testing protocols 
(p=0.57 to 1.00). However, the two-way ANOVA for the hip and knee joint ROM of the 
stretched leg showed significant interaction (p=0.005, η2=0.53 and p=0.035, η2=0.38, for the 
hip and knee joint ROM, respectively). Immediately after the intermittent and continuous 
stretching protocol, hip joint ROM increased similarly by 2.9±0.8o (95%CI = 2.3 to 3.5o, 
p=0.001, Cohen's d=2.8) and 3.6±0.5o (95%CI = 3.3 to 4.0o, p=0.001, Cohen's d=2.4), 
respectively. Likewise, knee joint ROM increased similarly after the intermittent and 
continuous stretching protocol (5.1±1.9o, 95%CI = 4.2 to 6.1o, p=0.001, Cohen's d=0.85, and 
6.4±1.0o, 95%CI = 5.9 to 6.9o, p=0.001, Cohen's d=0.87, respectively). After the end of the 
CMJ testing, hip and knee joint ROM partially recovered towards the baseline only in the 
intermittent stretching condition. In contrast, in the continuous stretching condition, both hip 
and knee joint ROM remained increased after the jumps (Fig. 3). The test-retest reliability of 
both ROM measurements was high. For hip extension ROM: ICC=0.946, p<0.01; SEM=0.6o; 
CV=4.6%; p value of ANOVA= 0.44. For knee flexion ROM: ICC=0.971, p<0.01; 
SEM=1.4o; CV=1.9%; p value of ANOVA= 0.15. 
 
DISCUSSION 
The main finding of this study was that, compared to the control leg, a 3 x 30-s 
intermittent stretching protocol increased CMJ performance by 8.1%, while a continuous 
stretching protocol of equal total duration resulted in a transient decrease of CMJ performance 
of 17.5 and 12.0%, immediately after stretch to one minute post stretch, respectively. Thus, it 
may be suggested that in flexibility-trained athletes, total stretching duration (i.e. 90 s) may 
not be the main factor determining the effects of stretching on muscle performance (6), since 
intermittent and continuous stretching produced distinctly opposite changes in CMJ 
performance. Moreover, CMJ performance was enhanced following the intermittent stretching

protocol despite an increase in hip and knee joint ROM that was maintained for 10 min post-
stretching. 
The novel finding of the present study is that CMJ performance of flexibility-trained 
athletes increases following intermittent stretching of the lower-limb musculature. This is in 
apparent disagreement with current practice that advocates against static stretching due to its 
possible detrimental effect on explosive performance (34,39). However, a recent review (5) 
concluded that static stretching with total duration of <60 s may have little or no negative 
effect on force and jump performance. In addition, there are a few studies showing small (2-
4%) improvements in muscle power and running speed following static stretching of 4-5 
different leg muscle groups, each lasting 10-30 s (3). In line with those studies, the results of 
the present study showed a large increase in one-leg CMJ performance compared both with 
baseline as well as with the non-stretched, control leg (Fig. 2). 
The increase in CMJ following intermittent stretching may be partially explained by the 
short duration of each stretching bout (30 s) followed by a 30 s rest interval. A previous study 
(27) showed that during repeated 90 s stretches, muscle viscoelastic properties were largely 
affected from the initial 90 s bout, and viscoelastic relaxation of the hamstrings remained for 
1 h after stretching. However, when stretching duration of stretching bouts was shorter (3 x 45 
s), viscoelastic stress relaxation recovered rapidly in each 30 s rest period between the 
stretches (25). Thus, in the present study, the combination of a relatively short stretch with a 
30 s rest interval may have resulted in maintenance of muscle stiffness, in contrast with the 
longer (90 s) continuous stretching (21,26,28). A possibly maintained stiffness, in 
combination with repeated jumping, may partially explain the improved CMJ performance in 
the first 4 min of recovery following intermittent stretching (Fig. 2). 
Another factor contributing to the increase in CMJ performance following intermittent 
stretching may be the use of single vs. double leg jumps. Due to the phenomenon of bilateral

deficit, total work of the hip, knee and ankle joints is between 28 and 58% greater during one 
leg compared with two-leg jumping (8). Furthermore, muscle activation is also higher and 
push-off time is about 40% longer during single-leg, compared with two-leg jumping (8). The 
slower movement, combined with higher muscle load and muscle activation in single-leg, as 
opposed to double-leg jumping, may result in a potentiating effect with each subsequent jump 
i.e. an increase in muscle power following a “conditioning” stimulus from each preceding 
jump (31,35). From the data of the control leg, it is clear that repeated jumping (every 1 min) 
results in a gradual increase in CMJ performance that was significantly higher than baseline 
on the 4th min of recovery (Fig. 3). Thus, single-leg CMJ efforts performed every minute 
serve as a muscle activation stimulus. However, an increase of the rest interval between jumps 
from 1 to 2 min after the 4th min of recovery resulted in a gradual decline of CMJ 
performance towards baseline (Fig. 2). The fact that repeated CMJ testing induces by itself a 
potentiation of jump performance may be a confounding factor in studies examining the 
effects of an intervention during recovery. However, the design of the present study, where 
one leg received an intervention and the other served as the control, allowed the calculation of 
the net effect of the two interventions on CMJ performance, and showed clear and opposite 
effects of intermittent and continuous stretching. 
The finding that a continuous static stretch lasting 90 s reduced subsequent vertical jump 
performance has been confirmed by several previous studies and has implications for its use 
immediately before activities requiring speed and power (20,34). The decrease of CMJ 
performance after continuous stretching protocols has been attributed to the effect of 
prolonged stretching on mechanical and neural factors that impair effective force transmission 
and muscle activation, such as decreased muscle activation or altered reflex sensitivity and the 
storage and utilization of elastic energy (13,21,25,27,36,37,40). A decrease in muscle stiffness 
following long duration static stretching (27) could increase the electromechanical delay (11),

thus reducing CMJ performance. Additionally, a more compliant muscle-tendon unit may 
result in a decreased sensitivity of muscle spindles possibly reducing the speed of muscle 
activation and thus power output after stretching exercises (1,15). Viscoelastic deformation of 
a muscle’s parallel elastic components may also influence lateral force transmission and 
consequently force and power generation (9,25,27). As shown in previous studies, the 
viscoelastic deformation of the muscle is not only larger when stretching duration is 90 s, but 
does not recover even after 1 hour, compared with shorter duration stretches, and this may 
also explain our findings (21,26,28). Recent evidence shows that the increase in muscle 
compliance after prolonged static stretching may also alter the length-tension relationship, so 
that the stretch-induced strength decrements are most apparent at a short muscle length (4). A 
possible shift of the length-tension relationship in the present study implies that muscle 
performance is affected at the more open knee angles, i.e. the range of motion where the 
quadriceps muscles exert force during the one-leg vertical jump (8). Finally, larger fatigue 
during the continuous vs. intermittent stretching may contribute to the results observed in the 
present study. There is evidence suggesting that static stretching may place a portion of the 
motor units into a fatigue state, resulting in an increased number of motor units recruited to 
perform the same submaximal mechanical work compared to no preceding stretching (24,40). 
Interestingly, muscle fatigue was only observed following continuous static stretching (40 s), 
compared with equal duration of intermittent stretching (2 x 20 s) (16). Ιn line with this result, 
Gomes et al. (17) also reported that intermittent stretching (3 sets of 30 s of static stretching 
interspersed by 30 sec of interval) did not reduce muscle endurance. 
The two stretching methods conferred similar increases in hip extension and knee 
flexion immediately after stretching, thus confirming previous studies reporting that the acute 
change of ROM following stretching is dependent on total stretch duration (20). Ten minutes 
after stretching, hip and knee joint ROM in both protocols remained increased, with only hip

joint ROM after intermittent stretching exhibiting a small recovery towards baseline (Fig. 3). 
Thus, although both protocols are equally effective in increasing ROM, continuous stretching 
may be superior if maintenance of ROM is required. The dissociation of changes in ROM and 
CMJ performance is an interesting finding of the present study. Although ROM was similarly 
increased following both stretching protocols, there were opposite effects of intermittent and 
continuous stretching on subsequent CMJ performance (Fig. 2). Interestingly, Mizuno et al. 
(29) reported that following 5 min of static stretching, the increase in ROM lasted 30 min, 
while the decrease in muscle stiffness and isometric peak torque were restored within 10 min.  
A few previous studies have shown contralateral effects from stretching on the 
unstretched limb. For example, Cramer et al. (14) reported decreases in muscle activation 
from pre to post-stretch in both the stretched and the unstretched leg extensors, suggesting that 
the stretch-induced neural deficit could be related to a central nervous system inhibitory 
mechanism. More recently, da Silva et al. (32) also found decreased drop jump height and 
impulse for the non-stretched limb immediately after an acute static stretching protocol (6 x 45 
s with 15 s rest), suggesting a stretch induced central nervous system inhibitory effect. In the 
present study, the static stretching protocol had no negative effect on the control leg in either 
type of stretching for the entire recovery period (Fig. 3). Cramer et al. (12), using a similar 
stretching protocol with the present study (4X30 sec of stretching with 15 sec of rest between 
stretches), found no effect of static stretching on peak torque in women in both the stretched 
and the unstretched limb during eccentric muscle actions and associated the lack of the stretch 
induced deficits with the characteristics of eccentric muscle actions. Single leg CMJ has a 
large eccentric component where high forces are built up during the eccentric phase and peak 
at the end of the eccentric/downward movement. Thus, in the present study, the lack of a 
contralateral effect of stretching may be explained by the significant eccentric component of

the single-leg jump, the shorter total duration of the stretching protocol and the training 
background of the study population. 
In conclusion, the application of an intermittent stretching protocol (3 x 30 s) causes a 
transient increase in CMJ performance, whereas the application of a continuous protocol (90 
s) led to a transient decrease of CMJ performance. Although an intermittent and a continuous 
stretching protocol results in similar increases in ROM, they have opposite effects on CMJ 
performance in elite athletes; this is despite the fact that total stretching duration is the same. 
This indicates that the mode of stretching (continuous vs. intermittent) is an important variable 
when examining the acute effects of static stretching on muscle performance. 
Practical applications 
The results of this study show that in flexibility-trained individuals an intermittent 
stretching protocol (3 x 30 s) increases, while a continuous stretching (1 x 90 s) protocol 
decreases, CMJ performance, despite the same total stretching duration. Thus, although static 
stretching has generally been shown to be detrimental to subsequent explosive performance, 
this may not be the case when static stretching is applied in an intermittent manner in 
flexibility-trained subjects. Due to the fact that CMJ performance following an intermittent 
stretching protocol peaked 4 min after its application, the combination of intermittent 
stretching with repeated single-leg jumps may be used as an effective stimulus during warm-
up, in order to acutely increase both explosive muscle performance and ROM. The fact that 
CMJ performance was transiently decreased following 90 s of static stretching, even in these 
flexibility-trained individuals, suggests that prolonged stretching should be avoided as part of 
a warm-up performed immediately prior to explosive muscle activities. However, it should be 
noted that the results of this study may not apply to all individuals since participants in this 
study were elite gymnasts who were accustomed to long stretching protocols and this may 
modify muscle responses to acute stretching. The combination of high levels of flexibility and
