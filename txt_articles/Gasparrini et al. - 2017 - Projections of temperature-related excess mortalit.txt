Summary
Background Climate change can directly affect human health by varying exposure to non-optimal outdoor temperature. 
However, evidence on this direct impact at a global scale is limited, mainly due to issues in modelling and projecting 
complex and highly heterogeneous epidemiological relationships across different populations and climates.
Methods We collected observed daily time series of mean temperature and mortality counts for all causes or 
non-external causes only, in periods ranging from Jan 1, 1984, to Dec 31, 2015, from various locations across the globe 
through the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network. We estimated temperature–mortality 
relationships through a two-stage time series design. We generated current and future daily mean temperature series 
under four scenarios of climate change, determined by varying trajectories of greenhouse gas emissions, using 
five general circulation models. We projected excess mortality for cold and heat and their net change in 1990–2099 
under each scenario of climate change, assuming no adaptation or population changes.
Findings Our dataset comprised 451 locations in 23 countries across nine regions of the world, including 
85 879 895 deaths. Results indicate, on average, a net increase in temperature-related excess mortality under 
high-emission scenarios, although with important geographical differences. In temperate areas such as northern 
Europe, east Asia, and Australia, the less intense warming and large decrease in cold-related excess would induce a 
null or marginally negative net effect, with the net change in 2090–99 compared with 2010–19 ranging from −1·2% 
(empirical 95% CI −3·6 to 1·4) in Australia to −0·1% (−2·1 to 1·6) in east Asia under the highest emission scenario, 
although the decreasing trends would reverse during the course of the century. Conversely, warmer regions, such as 
the central and southern parts of America or Europe, and especially southeast Asia, would experience a sharp surge 
in heat-related impacts and extremely large net increases, with the net change at the end of the century ranging 
from 3·0% (−3·0 to 9·3) in Central America to 12·7% (−4·7 to 28·1) in southeast Asia under the highest emission 
scenario. Most of the health effects directly due to temperature increase could be avoided under scenarios involving 
mitigation strategies to limit emissions and further warming of the planet.
Interpretation This study shows the negative health impacts of climate change that, under high-emission scenarios, 
would disproportionately affect warmer and poorer regions of the world. Comparison with lower emission 
scenarios emphasises the importance of mitigation policies for limiting global warming and reducing the 
associated health risks.

Introduction
Climate change is now widely recognised as the biggest 
global threat of the 21st century.1 The Fifth Assessment 
Report2 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC), the leading international body for the 
assessment of climate change, has established that 
anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases represent 
the dominant cause for the warming of the planet. 
Scenarios of climate conditions depend therefore on 
current and future trajectories of greenhouse gas 
emissions, 
mainly 
determined 
by 
socioeconomic 
development and climate policies.3 High-end scenarios, 
in which no mitigation strategies are in place, predict an 
average increase in surface temperature between 2·6°C 
and 4·8°C by the end of this century (2081–2100) relative 
to 1986–2005.2
Impacts on human health can occur through multiple 
pathways.4,5 In addition to indirect effects mediated, for 
instance, by the spread of disease vectors, increase in food 
insecurity, and migration and conflicts, direct effects are 
expected from the increase in extreme weather events 
such as floods, droughts, and heatwaves.1,4 Several studies

have focused on the health consequences directly 
associated with variation in outdoor temperature, 
predicting an increase in heat-related mortality and 
morbidity, 
and—when 
considered—a 
concomitant 
decrease in cold-related mortality.6–13 However, evidence on 
this direct impact at the global scale is limited. This is 
mainly due to the complexity of modelling the 
epidemiological relationships, characterised by differential 
patterns of non-linear and lagged effects associated with 
heat and cold, and to limitations of previous location-
specific or country-specific assessments to capture the 
heterogeneity of the risk across different populations and 
climates.14,15 Questions also remain about the extent to 
which expected decreases in cold-related mortality can 
offset the increase in deaths caused by heat. These issues 
make it difficult to draw a comprehensive picture of the 
direct impact of climate change across regions of the 
world and under different scenarios. This evidence is 
nonetheless crucial to develop coordinated and evidence-
based climate and public health policies.
In this contribution, we present projections of the 
impact of climate change on temperature-attributable 
mortality in hundreds of locations around the globe, using 
recently developed study designs and statistical methods.
Methods
Data sources and scenario models
A detailed description of the data, analytical framework, 
and statistical methods, partly described in previous 
work,16 is provided in the appendix.
We estimated location-specific associations using 
observed data on outdoor temperature and mortality. 
For this purpose, we obtained information from a 
dataset created through the Multi-Country Multi-City 
(MCC) Collaborative Research Network. The dataset is 
composed of observed daily time series of mean 
temperature and mortality counts for all causes or 
non-external causes only (International Classification of 
Diseases [ICD] codes 0–799 in ICD-9 and codes A00-R99 
in ICD-10) in largely overlapping periods ranging from 
Jan 1, 1984, to Dec 31, 2015, in addition to location-
specific meta-variables (appendix).
We computed future effects under alternative climate 
change scenarios using modelled climate and mortality 
projections. First, we obtained daily mean temperature 
series under scenarios of climate change consistent with 
the four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 
defined in the 2014 IPCC report.2 These four scenarios 
(RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5) correspond to 
increasing greenhouse gas concentration trajectories, 
and describe a range of changes in climate and related 
global warming, from mild (RCP2.6) to extreme 
(RCP8.5). We generated the temperature series under 
each RCP by general circulation models (GCMs), which 
offer a representation of past, current, and future climate 
dependent on greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, 
projections for five GCMs, representative of the range 
of available climate models, were developed and 
made available by the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model 
Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP).17 The ISI-MIP 
database provides daily mean temperature for his 
torical 
(1960–2005) 
and 
projected 
(2006–99) 
periods, 
bias-corrected and downscaled at a 0·5° × 0·5° spatial 
resolution, as single runs of each GCM under each RCP.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Several studies have evaluated the potential direct health impacts 
of climate change through variation in temperature-related 
excess mortality. Most of these investigations have only analysed 
heat-related impacts, and report an increase in excess mortality 
proportional to the extent of global warming under different 
climate change scenarios. Some studies have examined and 
compared variations in both heat-related and cold-related deaths. 
As expected, they consistently report an increase in the former 
and a reduction in the latter. However, results on the net impact 
on excess mortality are dependent on location and scenarios, and 
a quantitative comparison is made difficult by the variety of 
analytical designs that involve alternative effect summaries, 
statistical modelling, and assumptions.
Added value of this study
Our assessment provides a consistent comparison across 
hundreds of locations in various regions of the world, 
characterised by different climates, socioeconomic and 
demographic conditions, and levels of development of 
infrastructures and public health services. The analysis makes 
use of advanced analytical methods to flexibly account for 
changes in both heat-related and cold-related excess mortality, 
and to take into account local climates and 
temperature–mortality relationships.
Implications of all the available evidence
This study indicates that, in high-emission scenarios, most 
regions are projected to experience a steep rise in heat-related 
mortality that will not be equalled by a reduction in cold-related 
deaths, resulting in a substantial positive net increase in 
mortality. However, the potential impact varies across areas, and 
populations living in warmer and potentially poorer regions are 
expected to sustain an increased burden. Furthermore, the 
increase in temperature-related excess mortality would be 
substantially reduced in scenarios involving mitigation strategies 
to limit greenhouse gas emissions and further warming of the 
planet, and stricter mitigation approaches are associated with 
larger benefits. This evidence is crucial for the development of 
coordinated and evidence-based climate and public health 
policies, and for informing the ongoing international discussion 
on the health impacts of climate change.

We extracted the modelled daily temperature series for 
each of the studied locations in the period 1990–2099 by 
linking the coordinates with the corresponding cell of 
the grid, and recalibrated the modelled series using the 
observed series.18 We computed projected daily series of 
all-cause mortality as the average observed counts for 
each day of the year, repeated along the same projection 
period (1990–2099).
Estimation of the exposure–response relationships
We obtained location-specific estimates of temperature–
mortality associations from a two-stage time series 
analysis, as previously described.16 Briefly, in the first 
stage, we performed a quasi-Poisson regression separately 
in each location, controlling for season, long-term trends, 
and day of the week. We modelled the non-linear and 
delayed exposure–lag–response relationship between 
temperature and mortality with a distributed lag 
non-linear model, applying a bidimensional cross-basis 
spline function with 21 days of lag.19 We replaced the 
quadratic B-spline for the exposure–response relationship 
used in the previous analysis with a natural cubic 
spline, which allows a log-linear extrapolation beyond the 
observed temperature range.
In the second stage, we pooled the reduced estimates 
of the overall cumulative exposure–response curves 
using a multivariate meta-regression.20 We included a set 
of meta-predictors to capture part of the heterogeneity 
across locations: specifically indicators for region, 
indicators for climate classification,21 country-level gross 
domestic product per capita, and location-specific 
average and range of temperature. We then derived the 
best linear unbiased prediction of the overall cumulative 
exposure–response 
association 
in 
each 
location, 
expressed as relative risk.
Projection of the impact on mortality
We computed the excess mortality attributable to 
temperature by projecting the impact using the modelled 
daily series of temperature and mortality under the 
assumption of no adaptation or population changes, 
extending a method previously illustrated.16 Briefly, for 
each location, we used the overall cumulative relative risk 
corresponding to each day’s temperature to compute the 
attributable deaths and fraction in the next 21 days, using 
the minimum mortality temperature, referred to as the 
optimal temperature, as the reference. The sum of the 
contributions from all the days of the series is interpreted 
as the total excess mortality attributed to non-optimal 
temperature, whereas the components attributable to 
cold and heat were separated by summing the subsets 
corresponding to days with temperatures lower or higher 
than the minimum mortality temperature, respectively 
(see appendix for an illustrative example).
We first calculated the excess mortality separately for 
each location and combinations of GCMs and RCPs. We 
then computed attributable fractions as GCM-ensemble 
averages by aggregating by region and country, decade, 
and RCP, using the related total number of deaths as 
denominator. We used Monte Carlo simulations to obtain 
empirical CIs (eCIs), quantifying the uncertainty in both 
the estimation of the exposure–lag–response relationships 
and climate projections across GCMs (appendix).
We did all analyses with R (version 3.4.0), using the 
packages dlnm and mvmeta. The code is available on 
request from the first author (AG).

Results
We analysed MCC data for 451 locations within 
23 countries aggregated in nine regions (separated 
considering climatic and socioeconomic criteria, and 
consistent with United Nations geoscheme): North 
America, Central America, South America, northern 
Europe, central Europe, southern Europe, east Asia, 
southeast Asia, and Oceania (referred to from this point 
on as Australia, which was the only country included in 
the region; table 1). The dataset included 85 879 895 deaths 
observed within overlapping periods. The geographical 
distribution and average mean temperature of the 
451 locations shows the wide range of regions of the 
world included in this assessment and characterised by 
different climatic conditions, from cold places in North 
America and northern Europe to tropical areas in South 
America and southeast Asia (figure 1). However, entire 
regions of the world, such as Africa and the Middle East, 
are not represented.
Table 2 shows the distribution of average location-
specific temperature in the current period (2010–19) and 
the projected increase at the end of this century 
(2090–99) under the four climate change scenarios, with 
a graphical representation of the temperature trends in 
the appendix. A steep increase is consistently projected 
under high-end scenarios (RCP6.0 and RCP8.5), 
whereas in pathways that assume mitigation policies to 
limit greenhouse gas emissions (RCP2.6 and RCP4.5), 
the increase slows at different times during the next 
decades and potentially decreases in some regions under 
RCP2.6 (appendix). By the end of the century, a reduction 
in greenhouse gas emissions could prevent a large part 
of warming in the analysed areas, with the average 
temperature increase being in the range 0·4–0·8°C 
under RCP2.6 compared with 3·3–4·9°C under RCP8.5. 
However, comparison between regions reveals strong 
geographical differences, with a smaller temperature 
increase in regions such as Australia and northern 
Europe compared with southern Europe and South and 
North America (table 2, appendix).
Heat-related and cold-related excess mortality in the 
nine regions projected under three different RCPs are 
reported in figure 2 (see appendix for the actual figures 
by region and country for all the RCPs). As expected, the 
graphs indicate a common pattern of attenuation in cold-
related mortality and rise in the excess associated with 
heat. Slopes are steeper under RCP8.5, whereas the 
projected trends slow down during the 21st century 
under scenarios involving mitigation strategies. The 
graphs show important differences across regions. In 
some areas, such as northern Europe, east Asia, and 
Australia, the currently high cold-related excess mortality 
is projected to decrease from 7·4–8·7% in 2010–19 to 
3·7–5·9% in 2090–99 under scenarios of intense 
warming (RCP8.5). The heat-related excess mortality is 
currently low in these regions (0·3–0·5%), and it is 
projected to increase moderately in the same period and 
scenario (2·5–3·2%).
By contrast, areas dominated by hotter climates, such 
as Central and South America, southern Europe, and 
southeast Asia, show a different pattern and an increased 
impact of climate change. These regions are currently 
characterised by relatively higher heat-related impacts, in 
the order of 0·6–1·7% in 2010–19. The excesses are 
projected to rise considerably by the end of the century 
under RCP8.5, reaching 10·5% (95% eCI 5·6 to 17·3) in 
southern Europe and 16·7% (−1·7 to 33·2) in southeast 
Asia. Conversely, the cold component becomes less 
important and would almost disappear in equatorial 
areas, for instance decreasing to 0·7% (0·1 to 1·7) in

southeast Asia at the end of the century. North America 
and central Europe, regions characterised by diverse 
climatic conditions or a continental climate with cold 
winters and relatively hot summers, show results that are 
intermediate between the two groups.
With regard to net change in mortality totally 
attributable to non-optimal temperature (ie, combining 
heat and cold contributions), the first group of regions 
(northern Europe, east Asia, and Australia) are projected 
to initially experience a net reduction, with the net 
change ranging from −1·2% (95% eCI −3·6 to 1·4) in 
Australia to −0·1% (−2·1 to 1·6) in east Asia (appendix); 
however, this pattern would reverse at some point 
during this century under the more extreme RCP8.5 
scenario (figure 3). Conversely, the change in all the 
other regions, especially those characterised by hotter 
climates, is driven by the sharp surge in heat-related 
mortality, with indications of a substantial net increase 
in excess mortality. The net change becomes pronounced 
in areas such as South America (4·6% increase, 95% eCI 
−17·1 to 18·6), southern Europe (6·4% increase, 2·3 to 
12·3), Central America (3·0% increase, −3·0 to 9·3), 
central Europe (3·5% increase, 0·4 to 7·1), and 
particularly southeast Asia (12·7% increase, −4·7 to 28·1) 
under RCP8.5 (appendix). Country-specific estimates 
indicate within-region differences, especially in areas 
with diverse climates (appendix).
The comparison of the impact across RCPs suggests 
that the net excess mortality would be reduced under 
lower greenhouse gas emission scenarios (figure 3). 
Although an important net increase is still present 
in hotter areas under RCP4.5, the changes are 
comparatively very small under the stricter RCP2.6 
(figure 3). However, the estimates of the net change are 
affected by a low precision, due to the uncertainty 
related to the projected changes in temperature across 
GCMs and to the extrapolated exposure–response 
relationships, in particular in areas projected to 
experience a substantial shift in temperature (appendix).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study represents by far the 
largest epidemiological investigation of potential health 
effects directly associated with variation in outdoor 
temperature under climate change scenarios. The 
assessment includes and compares results from 
hundreds of locations across various regions of 
the 
world, 
characterised 
by 
different 
climates, 
socioeconomic and demographic conditions, and levels 
of development of infrastructures and public health 
services. The analysis applies advanced analytical 
methods to flexibly account for changes in both 
heat-related and cold-related excess mortality, and 
allows for local climates and temperature–mortality 
relationships in projecting impacts under different 
ranges of temperature increase consistent with 
scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions.
Results of this investigation show that climate change 
has the potential to produce a substantial increase in 
temperature-related mortality in most regions. Figures 
show a steep rise in heat-related excess mortality that, 
under extreme scenarios of global warming, is not 
balanced by a decrease in cold-related deaths. However, 
the predicted impacts show a strong geographical 
variability. Some temperate areas such as northern 
Europe, east Asia, and Australia, are characterised by a 
relatively small projected warming and increase in 
heat-related mortality. In these regions, the cold 
component remains higher and the net change would 
be smaller than in the other regions studied. By 
contrast, all the other regions are projected to 
experience a strong surge in heat-related excess 
mortality, 
while 
the 
cold 
component 
becomes 
progressively less important. The net impact seems to 
be stronger in warmer areas of America and Europe, 
and particularly in places with tropical climates such as 
southeast Asia. Notably, arid or equatorial regions, 
although under-represented in our dataset, include a 
large proportion of the current and projected global 
population, and will contribute greatly to the global 
impact of climate change.
Changes in temperature-related excess mortality are 
also highly dependent on the extent of warming 
expected under alternative emission scenarios. The 
strongest effects are projected under RCP8.5, a scenario 
characterised by unabated greenhouse gas emissions 
and an associated steep increase in temperature. 
Conversely, the effects of climate change, and 
particularly the increase in heat-related mortality in 
warmer regions, are comparatively smaller in scenarios 
assuming mitigation strategies, and null or marginally 
negative under the stricter RCP2.6. These findings 
emphasise the importance of implementation of 
effective climate policies to contain global warming and 
prevent the associated negative impacts.

Our results are largely consistent with published 
investigations in single locations or countries, although 
previous findings have often been limited to heat-related 
mortality and are dependent on the choice of location, 
scenarios, and modelling approaches.6–13 In particular, 
the variety of analytical designs, with alternative effect 
summaries, statistical modelling, and assumptions, 
makes it difficult to quantitatively compare results and 
to draw a comprehensive picture of the global impact of 
climate change directly attributable to changes in 
non-optimal temperature exposure. By contrast, our 
assessment applies an advanced and well tested 
statistical framework across various regions and 
climates, accounting for location-specific non-linear 
and lagged temperature–mortality relationships,22 and 
provides a consistent overview of geographical and 
temporal differences.
Some 
assumptions 
and 
limitations 
must 
be 
acknowledged. Our projections of current estimates 
of temperature–mortality associations under future 
warming scenarios allow isolation of the effects of the 
changing climate, but ignore contributions from other 
factors, including demographic changes and adaptation 
(see appendix).23–26 The reported figures should therefore 
be interpreted as potential impacts under well defined but 
hypothetical scenarios, and not as predictions of future 
excess mortality. We did not choose locations and 
countries following a sampling procedure that ensured 
representativeness for each region, and as mentioned 
above, this study does not provide evidence for large areas 
of the world owing to insufficient data. Estimates are also 
affected by considerable uncertainty, particularly those 
related to the net impact, due to both variability in 
the climate models and imprecision in the estimated 
exposure–response curves.15 The latter component is often 
larger, and mainly related to uncertainty in extrapolation 
of the functions beyond the observed temperature range. 
In relation to this point, the log-linear extrapolation 
applied here can be inadequate to pick potential non-linear 
increases in risk due to particularly intense heat events 
that might occur in the future, and this would result in an 
underestimation of heat-related excess deaths.

In summary, this study offers a comprehensive 
characterisation of climate change impacts due to 
changes in exposure to non-optimal outdoor temperature, 
hot as well as cold, across various regions and under 
alternative scenarios of global warming. Two results 
must be highlighted. First, the impact varies across areas, 
and populations living in warmer and, in some cases, 
poorer regions are expected to experience a heavier 
burden. Second, increases in temperature-related excess 
mortality are substantially reduced in scenarios involving 
mitigation strategies to limit greenhouse emissions and 
further warming of the planet, and stricter mitigation 
approaches are associated with larger benefits. The 
evidence produced in this study can inform the ongoing 
international discussion and implementation of the 
recent agreement reached in Paris,27,28 and contribute to 
the development of coordinated and evidence-based 
climate and public health policies.1,29
Figure 3: Temporal change in excess mortality by region
The graph shows the difference in excess mortality by decade compared with 2010–19 in nine regions and under three climate change scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5). Estimates are reported
