ABSTRACT 
Background 
Women aged 35 years or over have an increased risk of antepartum stillbirth at term. Labor 
induction would likely reduce stillbirth, but might increase Cesarean delivery, which already is 
common among older women.  
Methods 
We conducted a randomized controlled trial involving women in their first pregnancy, aged 35 years 
or over. Women were randomised to labor induction between 39+0 and 39+6 weeks or “expectant 
management”, waiting until the spontaneous onset of labor, or until a medical problem arose 
mandating induction.  The primary outcome was Cesarean delivery.  
Results  
619 women participated. In an intention to treat analysis, there were no significant differences 
between groups in the proportion of women who had cesarean section (98 (32%) in the induction 
group versus 103 (33%) in the expectant group (relative risk [RR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 – 1.14), or 
instrumental vaginal delivery (115 (38%) v. 104 (33%), respectively, RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.96 – 1.77).  
There were no maternal or infant deaths and no significant between group differences in maternal 
experience or in the frequency of adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes. 
Conclusions 
Induction of labor at 39 weeks for women of advanced maternal age, as compared with expectant 
management, had no significant effect on the rate of cesarean section nor adverse short-term 
effects on maternal or neonatal outcomes. Our trial was not designed or powered to assess effects 
of this strategy on stillbirth. (ISRCTN11517275)

Introduction 
 
The average age at childbirth in industrialized nations has been steadily increasing for about 30 
years1. Between 1996 and 2006, births to women aged 35 years or over in the UK rose from 12% to 
20% of all births2. In 2006, 5.6% of UK live births were to nulliparous women aged 35 years or over.   
 
As compared with younger women, women aged 35 years or over have higher risks of perinatal 
death, hypertensive disease, gestational diabetes mellitus, placenta praevia and placental 
abruption1,3,4. They are also at increased risk of preterm labor and of bearing macrosomic (>3999g) 
or low birth weight (<2500g) infants. The women themselves typically believe that their age puts 
their infant at increased risk3. Unsurprisingly, they have higher rates of obstetric intervention.   
 
The Cesarean section rate for nulliparous women in the UK is 38% among those 35 years or over and 
50% among those 40 years or over3. In nulliparous women, the relationship between maternal age 
and delivery by emergency Cesarean is linear5.   
 
Induction at or before the due date in women aged 35 years or over may be beneficial because the 
gestational age of delivery associated with the lowest cumulative risk of perinatal death is 38 
weeks6.  Nulliparous women have a higher risk of stillbirth than multiparous women for all maternal 
age groups7,8. Induction is currently offered to all women in the UK at 41-42 weeks gestation, when 
the stillbirth risk is 2 to 3 in 10009,10; older women experience this risk at earlier gestational ages (2.6 
in 1000 from 37 weeks onwards)7. However, induction carries risks (cord prolapse, uterine 
hyperstimulation), has a perceived association with Cesarean section and benefits may be offset by 
longer term adverse child outcomes due to delivery at ‘early-term’ gestations (37-39 weeks)11-14.    
 
Some UK obstetricians already induce older pregnant women at the due date (40 weeks) (39% 
women aged 40-44, 58% women aged 45 and over), but of those who do not, one third are reluctant 
to offer it for fear of increasing the likelihood of Cesarean delivery, despite believing it would 
improve perinatal outcomes15. However, there is a growing body of evidence that induction of labor 
 4 
 
at term for other reasons does not increase Cesarean rates and may even reduce them16, in which 
case an effective intervention is being underutilised. 
 
Most trials of induction at or near term have included women with established pregnancy 
complications, hypertension17, pre-labor rupture of membranes18 growth restriction19, diabetes20 or 
macrosomia21.  The few trials of induction in the absence of pathology22-25 are relatively small (total n 
= 1377), date from the 1970s, and may not be applicable to modern obstetric practice. To our 
knowledge there have been no trials of induction of labor for advanced maternal age. The 35/39 trial 
was designed to test the hypothesis that induction of labor at 39 weeks among nulliparous women 
of advanced maternal age would reduce Cesarean delivery. 
 
METHODS 
 
We performed a multi-center randomized controlled trial of induction of labor between 39+0 and 
39+6 weeks gestation or expectant management in nulliparous pregnant women aged 35 years or 
over.  The original and final trial protocols are available on line at NEJM.org. Professor James 
Thornton and Dr. Kate Walker take responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of reporting 
and for the fidelity of the report to the study protocol. 
 
Participants 
Nulliparous women aged 35 years or over on their expected due date, with a singleton live fetus in a 
cephalic presentation were recruited between August 2012 and March 2015 from 38 UK National 
Health Service hospitals and 1 UK primary care trust. Women were ineligible if their pregnancy was 
complicated by a known lethal fetal congenital abnormality or if they had any contraindications to 
labor (e.g. evidence of fetal compromise), vaginal delivery (e.g. placenta praevia) or expectant 
management (e.g. gestational diabetes).  
 
Women with a previous myomectomy, no ultrasound (for gestational age estimation) before 22 
weeks, or who had undergone in vitro fertilization using donor eggs were also excluded. The study 
 5 
 
was approved by the Derby Research Ethics Committee, and participants gave written informed 
consent. 
 
 
Women were randomized at 36+0 – 39+6 weeks gestation.  Randomization was individual, using a 1:1 
ratio, based on a computer generated pseudo-random code using random permuted blocks of 
randomly varying size generated by the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit. The randomization was 
stratified by center and maternal age (3 strata: 35-37, 38-39, 40 years or over). After gaining 
consent, research staff at individual sites logged into an internet based randomization system to 
access the randomised treatment allocation. Neither participants nor treating clinicians were 
masked to the allocated group.  
 
Women were randomly allocated to either induction of labor between 39+0 and 39+6 weeks 
gestation, or to expectant management i.e. awaiting spontaneous onset of labor unless a situation 
developed necessitating delivery either by induction or Cesarean. Women randomized to the 
expectant group were offered induction between 41+0 and 42+0 (i.e. 7-14 days after the due date), 
with the exact time determined by their preference and the consultant’s usual practice. No 
additional monitoring prior to 42+0 was offered unless it was the consultant’s usual practice. If the 
patient declined the offer of induction at 42 weeks, she was offered a scan for growth and amniotic 
fluid volume and daily or alternate daily cardiotocography monitoring according to the consultant’s 
usual practice. In the induction group, local policies for induction of labor were followed. Each unit 
recorded its regimen for use of prostaglandin and oxytocin and Bishop score cut-off for amniotomy, 
prior to starting the trial. Staff within a given unit were encouraged to use the same induction 
protocol for all participants and also for those women who for whatever reason required induction 
in the expectant management group.   
 
The primary outcome was Cesarean delivery. The maternal secondary outcomes were mode of 
delivery other than Cesarean (vaginal delivery, assisted vaginal delivery, vaginal breech delivery), 
onset of labor, indication for induction of labor, method of induction of labor, indication for 
 6 
 
cesarean section, intrapartum complications, and postpartum morbidity (need for blood transfusion, 
systemic infection). Postpartum hemorrhage was defined as blood loss of ≥ 500ml at vaginal delivery 
or ≥ 1000ml at cesarean delivery. The neonatal secondary outcomes were livebirth/stillbirth, birth 
weight, neonatal intensive care admission, birth trauma and two composite outcomes for serious 
neonatal morbidity (direct trauma and hypoxic trauma). The composite neonatal direct trauma 
outcome included subdural hematoma, intracerebral or intraventricular haemorrhage, spinal-cord 
injury, basal skull fracture, peripheral nerve injury or long bone fracture. The composite neonatal 
hypoxia outcome included seizures, hypotonia, abnormal level of consciousness, and the use of 
cooling. The components of the two perinatal composite outcomes (trauma and hypoxia) were 
prespecified in the statistical analysis plan before the trial allocation code was broken. Data were 
collected immediately following hospital discharge by the research midwife at each center.  Other 
secondary outcomes included maternal delivery expectation/experience measured by the Childbirth 
Experience Questionnaire 26 sent one month after the birth. This measure assesses four domains of 
childbirth experience (Own capacity, Professional support, Perceived safety and Participation).  
Responses were scored according to the author’s instructions (Supplementary Appendix Table 2). 
Scores on each domain ranges from 0 to 4; higher scores indicate better childbirth experience.    
 
Additional secondary outcomes pertaining to resource use and baseline and postnatal health status 
were collected to allow a future cost-utility analysis to be performed. 
 
Statistical analysis 
The power calculation was based on Cesarean delivery rates in women with singleton cephalic 
pregnancies in labor at term from a Scottish 2004-2008 cohort of all deliveries which were 23% 
among women 35-39 years of age and 27% among women aged 40 years or older (Gordon Smith, 
unpublished data , Dec 2011). Assuming a Cesarean delivery rate of 25% in controls, a sample size of 
630 women was calculated to provide 80% power with a two-sided significance level of 5% to test 
 7 
 
the hypothesis that induction of labor reduces the cesarean section rate to 16%, a 36% relative 
reduction (or a 9% absolute reduction).  
 
Participants were analyzed according to their allocated group (intention to treat), regardless of 
adherence with allocation and according to a pre-specified statistical analysis plan. For the primary 
outcome , a generalized linear model (with a binomial family and a log link) was used to calculate 
relative risk and 95% confidence intervals after adjustment for center and age (center was 
accounted for using robust standard errors using the vce cluster command in Stata). We had planned 
also a sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of missing data on our results, but this was 
unnecessary as there were minimal missing data.  
 
For analyses of mode of delivery (if not by cesarean section), we used a multinomial logistic 
regression model to calculate relative risk and 95% confidence intervals after adjustment for center 
and age, using vaginal delivery as the reference group. For intrapartum complications, postpartum 
morbidity and the serious neonatal morbidity composites, we used the same generalized linear 
model as for the primary outcome to calculate relative risk and 95% confidence intervals. For 
individual birth trauma outcomes, we summarized the frequency of these events in each group.   
For maternal experience measured by the Childbirth Experience Questionnaire (CEQ)26  a complete 
case analysis was performed comparing the mean subscale scores and mean total score (average of 
the 4 individual subscale scores) for women in the treatment group versus women in the control 
group, using an unpaired t test. A Mann Whitney U test was used to calculate p values. Where there 
were a few missing items, the half-scale method was used so that when the respondent had 
answered at least half of the items in the scale, the sum of the scores were divided by the number of 
answered items [87]. 
 
For the primary outcome, a prespecified subgroup analysis by maternal age (35-37, 38-39, 40 years 
or over) was performed by including an interaction term in the model.  An independent Data 
 8 
 
Monitoring Committee met regularly throughout the study.  No interim analyses were undertaken.  
All analyses were performed in Stata (version 13). 
 
RESULTS 
 
Recruitment took place between August 2012 and March 2015. Recruitment by trial center is shown 
in Supplementary Appendix Table 3. One woman in the treatment group withdrew consent for her 
data to be used. The number of participants randomly assigned to each group and whether they 
received the intended treatment is shown in Figure 1. Uptake was 13.6% (619/4642).  Of the 46% of 
non-participants (n=1804) who expressed a preference for one of the management strategies, 1595 
(88%) preferred expectant management. Non-adherence was more common in the induction group 
vs expectant arm group (13.4% vs. 5.4%) (Table 2). 
 
The baseline characteristics were similar between groups (Table 1).   
 
There was no significant difference between the induction group and the expectant management 
group in the frequency of Cesarean section (98 (32%) versus 103 (33%); relative risk (RR) 0.99, 95% 
CI 0.87 – 1.14). The frequency of assisted vaginal delivery was 115 (38%) in the induction arm, versus 
104 (33%) in the expectant management arm (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.96 – 1.77). There were no 
significant differences between groups in other maternal outcomes (Table 3) or neonatal outcomes 
(Table 4). Serious adverse events were reported in 10 (3%) women in the induction group versus 23 
(7%) in the expectant management group; most of these were included as predefined secondary 
outcomes (Supplementary Appendix Table 4). The groups did not differ materially in the methods of 
induction (Supplementary Appendix Table 5). 
 
Subgroup analysis of the primary outcome by maternal age showed no significant difference in the 
treatment effects by age (p interaction 0.65), (Table 3). 
 
 9 
 
In total, 512 (83%) women returned the Childbirth Experience Questionnaire. There were no 
significant differences in subgroup or total CEQ scores (indicating childbirth experience) between the 
two groups (Supplementary Appendix Table 6). 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
In this multicenter randomized trial involving women aged 35 years or over, induction of labor at 39 
weeks gestation, as compared with expectant management had no significant effect on the cesarean 
section rate. Moreover, maternal and neonatal outcomes, and women’s experience of labor, did not 
significantly differ between these strategies.  
   
Our trial had some limitations. For one, it was restricted to nulliparous women in the UK who did not 
have high risk pregnancies. Thus the results may not be generalizable to older multiparous women 
and also may not apply to all nulliparous pregnant women aged 35 years or over.  
 
Although we found no significant between group difference in maternal experience of labor, this 
finding may not apply to women with a preference for one or other strategy.  
 
The time gap between randomization (36 weeks) and intervention (39 weeks) in our trial was 
imposed by the practical constraints of NHS maternity services. This limitation might not apply in 
other settings. This interval inevitably resulted in some women in the intervention arm entering 
labor spontaneously prior to their date for induction. Such "non-adherence" reduced the power of 
the trial but would not have biased the test for a difference between the groups because the 
analysis was by intention to treat.   
 
This trial was powered to detect a 36% relative difference (9% absolute difference) in Cesarean 
section rates, but we cannot rule out a smaller effect. The observed confidence intervals suggest 
that the plausible effect of induction ranges from a 28% percent decrease to a 36% percent increase 
in Cesarean delivery. 
 10 
 
 
The rate of assisted vaginal delivery appeared higher in the induction group than the expectant 
management group, although differences were not statistically significant. In populations with 
higher rates of second stage cesarean sections, the rate of cesarean delivery with induction of labor 
might be higher than in the present report.  
 
The current trial included participants from 38 UK NHS hospitals and one UK primary care trust, 
representing a mixture of secondary and tertiary level units. The results are generalizable to 
countries with similar demographics to the UK.   
 
The design was pragmatic; units were encouraged to use their usual method of induction for women 
in both arms requiring induction. There is considerable heterogeneity in methods employed for 
induction across the world. Different methods of induction have differing efficacy10. Most 
participating units used prostaglandin ripening followed if necessary by amniotomy and oxytocin 
infusion. It is unclear whether the results of this trial would be generalizable to centers using other 
methods of induction. 
 
 
Previous studies of induction of labor in women of advanced maternal age have been observational 
and have found an increased risk of cesarean delivery associated with induction27-29. Numerous 
randomized trials have assessed effect of labor induction at term for other indications, and these 
have been included in three recent meta-analyses, all of which demonstrated a reduction in 
cesarean delivery in women assigned to induction of labor30,31,16. The present results likewise did not 
indicate an increase in caesarean rates with induction as compared with expectant management. 
 
Our trial does not address whether induction of labor at 39 weeks can prevent stillbirths. However it 
supports the safety of performing of a larger trial to test the effects of induction on stillbirth and 
uncommon adverse neonatal outcomes in women aged 35 years or over, although such a trial would 
need to be extremely large.  
 
 11 
 
Although some observational studies have suggested a possible association between delivery at 
‘early-term’ gestations (37-39 weeks), versus ‘late-term’ gestations (40-41 weeks)11-14 and subtle 
long-term impact on children’s development and educational attainment, data are lacking from 
randomized trials to inform outcomes of infants after discharge from the hospital.  
 
In summary, induction of labor at 39 weeks for women of advanced maternal age, as compared with 
expectant management, had no significant effect on the rate of cesarean section nor adverse short-
term effects on maternal or neonatal outcomes.
