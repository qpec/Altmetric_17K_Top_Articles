The ability to hold information in working memory is fundamental for cognition. Contrary
to the long-standing view that working memory depends on sustained, elevated activity,
we present evidence suggesting that humans can hold information in working memory
via “activity-silent” synaptic mechanisms. Using multivariate pattern analyses to decode
brain activity patterns, we found that the active representation of an item in working
memory drops to baseline when attention shifts away. A targeted pulse of transcranial
magnetic stimulation produced a brief reemergence of the item in concurrently measured
brain activity. This reactivation effect occurred and influenced memory performance
only when the item was potentially relevant later in the trial, which suggests that
the representation is dynamic and modifiable via cognitive control. The results support
a synaptic theory of working memory.
T
he ability to mentally retain information in
an accessible state, to manipulate it, and to
use it to guide behavior is a critical building
block for cognition. It has long been assumed
that the neural basis for this working mem-
ory (WM) ability is elevated and persistent neu-
ronal firing (1). This assumption has been called
into question by recent proposals that infor-
mation can be held in WM via synaptic mecha-
nisms that do not require sustained, elevated brain
activity (2–4).
Building on theoretical frameworks that in-
formation can be held in WM in one of several
states of activation (5, 6), we recorded neural
activity while participants performed a multi-
step task in which two items were presented as
memoranda for each trial. A cue indicated which
item would be tested by the impending recog-
nition memory probe, followed by the probe, then
by a second cue, and then a second probe (Fig. 1).
There was equal probability following the first
cue, but not the second, that the uncued item
might be needed for an ensuing memory judg-
ment. This procedure moves the uncued item into
a different state than the cued item, which, by
definition, is in the focus of attention (7). Cogni-
tive theories refer to the intermediate state of this
unattended memory item (UMI) as “activated
long-term memory” (LTM) (5, 6).
For experiment 1, multivariate pattern analy-
sis (MVPA) showed evidence for an active repre-
sentation of the UMI that dropped to baseline
levels (Fig. 2) (7–9). This suggests that informa-
tion in WM (but outside of focal attention) can
be maintained in a latent state via mechanisms
other than sustained, elevated activity. Although
a similar drop-to-baseline pattern is observed when
participants are instructed to drop information

Fig. 1. General procedure. (A) In phase 1, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired while participants performed a one-item delayed-
recognition task for words, faces, or directions of motion; these data were used for multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). (B) Classifiers trained on the delay period
were used for subsequent analyses. For experiment 1, these classifiers were used to decode fMRI activity from phase 2 (Fig. 2). (C and D) For experiments 2 and 3, they
were used in a whole-brain searchlight conjunction analysis to generate participant-specific maps of category-sensitive areas (C); nonoverlapping areas were used for
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) targeting in phase 2 (D). (E) In phase 2, single pulses of TMS were delivered during the postcue delay periods.

 from WM (10, 11), here the UMI remained in
WM because, when so instructed by the second
cue, participants accurately reactivated it and
used it to evaluate the final probe (Fig. 2B).
In three additional experiments, we tested the
hypothesis that if a UMI is encoded in a dis-
tributed pattern of synaptic weights and held in
a state that is more accessible than trial-irrelevant
information, the readout from a nonspecific
burst of activity filtered through this network
might reveal this latent representation (2) (fig.
S1). This would be consistent with the idea that
networks in the posterior cortex can be dynam-
ically configured as matched filters to encode
behaviorally relevant information (3, 4, 12, 13).
For experiments 2 and 3, participants per-
formed the phase 2 WM task (Fig. 1) while we
recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and
applied single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimu-
lation (TMS) 2 to 3 s after the cue. For experi-
ment 2, we targeted brain regions identified from
the phase 1 MRI task as preferentially support-
ing MVPA decoding for one category, but not
the other two. MVPA of the spectrally transformed
EEG data from only the phase 2 task detected
reliable evidence for an active representation of
both memory items across the initial portion of
the trial, until the onset of the first cue, at which
point decoding accuracy remained elevated for
the attended memory item (AMI) but dropped to
the baseline for the UMI (14).
After a single pulse of TMS, there was a brief
recovery of MVPA decoding of the UMI—a “re-
activation effect”—before it returned to baseline
and remained there while the cued item was tested
[P = 0.01; Bayes factor (BF) = 3.64 against the
null] (Fig. 3A). TMS affected neither broadband
decoding of the AMI nor recognition memory
judgments (fig. S4). When we analyzed bandpass-
filtered data, the TMS reactivation effect was
isolated to signal from the beta band (fig. S5)
and was associated with a transient period of
above-chance decoding performance for both the
UMI and the AMI. The TMS reactivation effect
was specific for information that was in WM on
that trial, because above-chance MVPA perform-
ance, as assessed with the AUC (area under the
curve) analysis, necessarily means that TMS did
not activate a representation of the category that
was irrelevant on that trial.
In experiment 2, we administered blocks of
trials with TMS targeting one of the category-
selective regions, but we varied, on a trial-by-trial
basis, which category was the AMI and which
was the UMI. Each block included trials for which
the UMI belonged to the targeted region’s pre-
ferred category, and trials for which it did not.
A TMS reactivation effect was observed (Fig. 3B)
whether or not TMS targeted the UMI’s category-
preferred region, although the effect was larger
and more prolonged when it did (BF = 4.02
for targeted sites, 1.72 for nontargeted sites).
This finding suggests that WM is supported by
heightened connectivity between cortical networks
that represent all trial-relevant information (AMI
and UMI) relative to trial-irrelevant information
(15, 16).

but for the uncued category (blue) dropped to baseline. (A) After the first probe (red square), on
half the trials the second cue designated that the same item would be tested by the second probe,
and evidence for the two categories remained the same relative to baseline. (B) When the second

 Retrocues that inform subjects that they can
drop an item from memory result in a rapid loss
of multivariate evidence for the no longer
relevant item (11, 17). Nonetheless, proactive inter-
ference from stimuli presented on previous trials
indicates that the brain retains a residual trace
of such recent, but no longer relevant, informa-
tion (18). An important test of state-based models
of WM is whether there is a functional distinc-
tion between UMIs (putatively held in a state
of activated LTM) and dropped information (no
longer in WM). In experiment 3, with a differ-
ent group of participants, we also administered
TMS after the second cue, after which the un-
cued item would no longer be relevant on the
trial, and at which point it should have the same
status as an irrelevant item. If the TMS reacti-
vation effect is a consequence of an item being
maintained in a privileged state, it should only
be observed when that item is still potentially
relevant for the trial. We also jittered the onset
of TMS between 2 and 3 s after the cues (14)
and standardized TMS by targeting the same
region on every trial for all participants—an
MVPA-defined region in the right precuneus
known to be critical for the top-down control of
visual attention (19) (Fig. 4A).
For the first half of the trial, the results from
experiment 3 replicated those from experiment
2 (Fig. 4B), with a robust TMS reactivation ef-
fect for the UMI (BF = 9.8 against the null). For
the delay period following the second cue, how-
ever, there was no evidence for significant decod-
ing of the uncued item following the TMS pulse
(BF = 3.4 in favor of the null). These results sug-
gest that UMIs are maintained in a different state
than are items that have been dropped from WM,
and that the mechanisms that maintain latent
representations in WM are dynamic and modifi-
able via cognitive control (20).
Because our design entails decoding at the
category level, it does not rule out the pos-
sibility that the TMS reactivation effect reflects
a general reinstatement of category context (21),
rather than the temporary activation of the
UMI itself. The idea that the representation of
the UMI itself drives this effect would be
strengthened by demonstrating that TMS can
influence recognition memory decisions on this
task. If the TMS reactivation effect reflects a
temporary reinstatement of the UMI back into
the focus of attention, participants should have
more difficulty rejecting the UMI as a lure when
probing their memory of the AMI.
In experiment 4, we presented recognition
memory probes that matched the AMI on 50%
of trials; of the 50% of nonmatch probes, 30%
were drawn from the same category as the AMI,
and a critical 20% matched the UMI (14). Par-
ticipants were instructed to reject memory
probes that did not match the AMI. Critically,
only for the first probe was there an increased
proportion of false alarms to the UMI for TMS
relative to no-TMS trials (Fig. 3C, P = 0.01, BF =
3.48) (14).
Our results have important implications for
the understanding of WM at many levels. They

 provide neural evidence for at least two levels
of WM that are distinct from the default state
of LTM representations (5, 6). They are inconsistent
with models positing just one level of WM stor-
age (22, 23). They also suggest that instead of
“activated LTM,” a more apt label for the second
level of WM would be “prioritized LTM.” Informa-
tion can be held in WM in latent “activity-silent”
traces (11, 20). What might be the physiological
bases of such representations? Computational
models of WM have proposed that short-term
synaptic plasticity could be the basis for the tran-
sient formation of weight-based networks that
can represent information over short time periods
(2, 24).
Our results provide empirical evidence for
the existence of a short-term plasticity mech-
anism that is likely to be fundamental to a wide
range of cognitive functions involving attentional
selection (25) and may provide the building
blocks for long-term potentiation mechanisms
that support LTM (26). Therefore, our findings
introduce a potential avenue for reactivating and
strengthening representations that underlie many
classes of high-level cognition.
