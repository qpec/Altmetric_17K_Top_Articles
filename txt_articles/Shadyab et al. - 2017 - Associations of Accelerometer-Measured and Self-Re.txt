Few studies have assessed the association of sedentary time with leukocyte telomere length (LTL). In a
cross-sectional study conducted in 2012–2013, we examined associations of accelerometer-measured and self-
reported sedentary time with LTL in a sample of 1,481 older white and African-American women from the
Women’s Health Initiative and determined whether associations varied by level of moderate- to vigorous-
intensity physical activity (MVPA). The association between sedentary time and LTL was evaluated using multi-
ple linear regression models. Women were aged 79.2 (standard deviation, 6.7) years, on average. Self-reported
sedentary time was not associated with LTL. In a model adjusting for demographic characteristics, lifestyle be-
haviors, and health-related factors, among women at or below the median level of accelerometer-measured
MVPA, those in the highest quartile of accelerometer-measured sedentary time had significantly shorter LTL
than those in the lowest quartile, with an average difference of 170 base pairs (95% confidence interval: 4, 340).
Accelerometer-measured sedentary time was not associated with LTL in women above the median level of
MVPA. Findings suggest that, on the basis of accelerometer measurements, higher sedentary time may be
associated with shorter LTL among less physically active women.

Telomeres are repetitive DNA-protein structures located at
the ends of chromosomes that protect and maintain chromo-
somal stability and integrity (1). Telomeres progressively
shorten with age, leading to cellular senescence and apoptosis
(2, 3). Shortened leukocyte telomere length (LTL) has been
associated with cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and
major cancers (3–6).
Emerging evidence has linked LTL to modifiable factors
such as smoking, body mass index, and physical activity
(7–12). Sedentary behavior has also been studied in relation
to LTL, but with mixed findings. In the Nurses’ Health
Study, there was no association of total sedentary time or
specific sedentary behaviors with LTL (12), but in 2 recent
studies, reduced sedentary time was associated with longer
LTL (13, 14). However, these studies were limited by several
factors, including failure to measure sedentary time objec-
tively (i.e., by accelerometer). Accelerometer-measured sed-
entary time is not highly correlated with self-reported time,
the latter of which often underestimates actual time spent in
sedentary behaviors (15). These studies also did not measure
LTL using the Southern blot method, which has low mea-
surement error (16, 17). Additionally, they did not determine
whether associations of sedentary time with LTL varied by
level of physical activity. In previous studies, associations of

 sedentary time with adverse health outcomes were stronger
among persons with low levels of physical activity (18–21).
In a cross-sectional study, we assessed associations of
accelerometer-measured and self-reported sedentary time with
LTL in older white and African-American women from the
Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health
(OPACH) Study, an ancillary study of the Women’s Health
Initiative (WHI). We also determined whether associations
varied by hours of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical
activity (MVPA), race/ethnicity, or physical function.
Understanding the relationship between sedentary time and
LTL, a purported biomarker of cellular aging (22), is
important among older adults, who spend 8.5–10.7 hours/
day sedentary and are particularly vulnerable to the adverse
health consequences (e.g., obesity, type 2 diabetes, and all-
cause mortality) associated with prolonged sedentary time
(19, 23–25).
METHODS
Study population and data collection
The WHI is a large US prospective study investigating
the determinants of chronic diseases in postmenopausal
women. Details on the study have been previously pub-
lished (26, 27). Briefly, a racially and ethnically diverse
cohort of 161,808 postmenopausal women aged 50–79
years was recruited from 40 clinical centers nationwide
during 1993–1998. Women were randomized into one or
more of 3 clinical trials, including one of 2 hormone ther-
apy trials, or an observational study. In 2005, 77% of eli-
gible women agreed to be followed through 2010 in the
first WHI Extension Study. In 2010, 87% of women con-
sented to an additional 5 years of follow-up in the second
WHI Extension Study. Over 7,800 women from Extension
Study 2 were enrolled in the WHI Long Life Study, which
consisted of a one-time in-person visit conducted between
March 2012 and May 2013. The population of the current
study included women from OPACH, an ancillary study
of the Long Life Study that enrolled 7,048 women.
At the 1993–1998 baseline examination, participants
completed self-administered questionnaires assessing de-
mographic characteristics, medical history, and lifestyle
behaviors. The 2012–2013 visit involved collection of a
blood sample and assessment of physical measurements
(blood pressure, height, and weight) and physical function-
ing status. Study participants additionally wore an acceler-
ometer for 1 week and completed a sleep log and physical
activity questionnaire. A random sample of women from
the Long Life Study was selected for participation in a
case-cohort study on the relationship between LTL and
coronary heart disease. The present study was exclusive to
women with LTL measurements and complete information
on either accelerometer-measured (n = 1,297) or self-
reported (n = 1,383) sedentary time. There were 1,481
women in the final analytical sample.
All participants provided written informed consent, and
institutional review board approval was received by all par-
ticipating institutions.
Sedentary time and physical activity measures
Accelerometer-measured variables.
Participants were
asked to wear a triaxial accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X+;
ActiGraph LLC, Pensacola, Florida) on their right hip for 7
consecutive days during waking and sleeping hours, except
during bathing or swimming. Movement was captured
along 3 axes (vertical, anteroposterior, and mediolateral)
in 15-second epochs, and activity counts were provided
as composite vector magnitudes (VM) of these 3 axes.
Accelerometer wear time was identified using sleep logs
and a computer-automated algorithm developed specifically
for this study (28). Nonwear time was defined as an inter-
val of ≥90 minutes of consecutive zero VM counts/minute,
with allowance of up to 2 minutes of nonzero VM counts
if no counts were detected 30 minutes upstream or down-
stream from that interval; any other nonzero VM counts
were considered wear time (29, 30). Only participants with
4–7 valid days of accelerometer data were included in the
analysis, with a valid day being defined as having ≥10
hours of wear time (31).
A calibration study was performed in 200 study partici-
pants to determine relevant cutpoints along the distribu-
tion of VM counts to define sedentary behavior and
physical activity intensity in older women (32). Based on
this study, sedentary behavior was defined as 0–18 VM
counts per 15 seconds and MVPA as ≥519 VM counts per
15 seconds. Data are presented as the average number of
hours spent per day in these behaviors. For example,
hours/day of sedentary time was calculated as the sum of
total sedentary time during all valid days divided by the
number of valid days.
Self-reported variables.
In the physical activity ques-
tionnaire, participants were asked to estimate time spent sit-
ting in response to the question: “During a usual day and
night, about how many hours do you spend sitting? Be
sure to include the time you spend sitting at work, sitting at
the table eating, driving, or riding in a car or bus, and sit-
ting up watching TV or talking.” Participants also esti-
mated the time spent lying down: “During a usual day and
night, about how many hours do you spend sleeping or
lying down with your feet up? Be sure to include the time
you spend sleeping or trying to sleep at night, resting or
napping, and lying down watching TV.” A third question
asked participants to estimate the number of hours they had
typically spent sleeping per night during the past 4 weeks.
Total daily sedentary time was calculated as the sum of sit-
ting time and lying time minus sleeping time. This ques-
tionnaire previously showed moderate-to-high test-retest
reliability (33).
Participants also completed the Community Healthy
Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS)
Physical Activity Questionnaire, which was developed
for older adults and measures time spent in domestic and
leisure-time activities in a typical week during the past 4
weeks (34). Data are presented as average number of
hours per day spent in activities of moderate-to-vigorous
intensity, calculated by summing the total number of
hours spent in these activities during a typical week and
dividing by 7.

 Covariates
Variables assessed at the WHI baseline visit, at the
2012–2013 visit, and during WHI follow-up were used as
covariates. Baseline covariates included race/ethnicity,
education, marital status, smoking status, and alcohol con-
sumption. At the 2012–2013 visit, trained clinic staff mea-
sured height and weight and systolic and diastolic blood
pressures. Body mass index was calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by squared height in meters and was
categorized according to standard cutpoints (35). Current
physical functioning status was measured objectively at
the 2012–2013 visit using the Established Populations
for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) Short
Physical Performance Battery, which provides a summary
score (range, 0–12) calculated as the sum of balance,
chair-stand, and gait-speed scores, with a higher score
indicating better physical performance (36, 37).
Variables assessed during WHI follow-up included self-
rated health and history of hormone therapy, hypertension,
and chronic diseases. Self-rated health was measured by
means of a single item (38); the most recent value collected
within 2 years of the 2012–2013 visit was used. History of
hormone therapy was defined according to self-reported use
of hormones or participation in one of the WHI hormone
therapy trials. History of hypertension was defined as self-
reported physician diagnosis of hypertension, use of antihy-
pertensive medication, systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg,
or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg (measured at base-
line, during follow-up, or at the 2012–2013 visit). History
of chronic diseases was defined as occurrence of 1 or more
of the following diseases, each of which has been associ-
ated with both sedentary time and LTL in previous studies
(4–6, 21, 39, 40): coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes,
and cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer). Disease
status was self-reported at baseline. Incident diseases were
identified through the date of the 2012–2013 visit via peri-
odic clinic visits and via mailed questionnaires sent biannu-
ally to participants in the WHI Clinical Trial and annually
to Observational Study and Extension Study participants.
Diagnoses of incident diseases, except for diabetes, were
adjudicated by physician medical record review (41).
Diabetes was defined as self-reported physician’s diag-
nosis of diabetes treated with either oral medication or
insulin (42).
Measurement of LTL
DNA samples were extracted using the 5-prime method
(5 PRIME, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland) and were sent
in batches over a 1-year period to the Center of Human
Development and Aging Laboratory at Rutgers University
(New Brunswick, New Jersey) for LTL measurement. Each
batch consisted of randomly selected samples. The labora-
tory performing the LTL measurements was blinded to all
participant
characteristics.
Quality
control
procedures
included assessment of DNA integrity prior to LTL mea-
surement (16). DNA integrity was assessed visually after
ethidium bromide-stained 1% agarose gel electrophoresis
(200 V for 2 hours) and required that DNA appear as a
single compact crown-shaped band migrating in parallel
with the other samples on the gel. Telomere length (in kilo-
bases) was determined by the mean length of the terminal
restriction fragments using the Southern blot method, as
previously described (16). Analysis of each sample was
run in duplicate on different gels, and mean LTL was used
in the analyses. The average interassay coefficient of varia-
tion for blinded pair sets was 2.0%.
Statistical analysis
Data on accelerometer-measured and self-reported seden-
tary time variables were divided into quartiles for the analy-
sis. Categorical variables were compared across quartiles of
sedentary time using χ2 tests. Analysis of variance and
Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for comparisons of normally
distributed and non-normally distributed continuous variables
across quartiles of sedentary time, respectively. Because LTL
was normally distributed, general linear models were used to
determine age- and race/ethnicity-adjusted mean LTL values
across quartiles of sedentary time. Correlations were mea-
sured using the Pearson correlation coefficient.
Associations of accelerometer-measured and self-reported
sedentary time with LTL were evaluated using multiple linear
regression models. The first model adjusted for age and race/
ethnicity, and successive models adjusted for other potential
confounders, including demographic characteristics (education
and marital status), lifestyle behaviors (smoking, alcohol use,
body mass index, and MVPA), and health-related variables
(history of chronic diseases and hormone therapy). All models
for accelerometer-measured sedentary time were also adjusted
for wear time. Models for accelerometer-measured sedentary
time adjusted for accelerometer-measured MPVA, and those
for self-reported sedentary time adjusted for self-reported
MVPA.
Multicollinearity between variables was evaluated using
tolerance values, with a value less than 0.10 indicating mul-
ticollinearity. However, multicollinearity was not observed
in any of the models. Tests for linear trend were performed
by including sedentary time variables as continuous vari-
ables in the models. Interactions between sedentary time
and race/ethnicity, physical performance score, and MVPA
were tested by including interaction terms for the products
of these variables with sedentary time in the models.
Results were stratified according to the median MVPA
level, based on an a priori assumption that associations of
sedentary time with LTL may vary by MVPA (18–21).
Cutpoints of 0.5 hours/day of MVPA, based on current rec-
ommendations of ≥30 minutes/day of MVPA for adults
(43), and 0.36 hours/day (which equates to 2.5 hours/week
based on current guidelines), were also used. P values were
2-tailed and were considered nominally statistically signifi-
cant at P < 0.05. All analyses were performed using SAS,
version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
In the overall sample, there were 863 (58.3%) white and
618 (41.7%) African-American women. Women were aged
79.2 (standard deviation (SD), 6.7) years, on average,

 ranging in age from 64 years to 95 years. Women wore the
accelerometer for an average of 14.7 (SD, 1.3) hours/day
over an average of 6.3 (SD, 0.8) days. The mean amounts
of accelerometer-measured and self-reported sedentary time
were 9.2 (SD, 1.5) hours/day and 8.6 (SD, 4.3) hours/day,
respectively. The mean amounts of accelerometer-measured
and self-reported MVPA were 0.8 (SD, 0.5) hours/day and 0.5
(SD, 0.6) hours/day, respectively. Accelerometer-measured and
self-reported sedentary time were weakly correlated (r = 0.27;
P < 0.001); accelerometer-measured and self-reported MVPA
were similarly weakly correlated (r = 0.28; P < 0.001). Mean
LTL was 6.6 (SD, 0.6) kilobases and ranged from 4.9 kilo-
bases to 8.9 kilobases. LTL was inversely associated with age
(r = −0.38; P < 0.001), and telomeres were longer in African-
American women than in white women (age-adjusted mean
lengths were 6.75 (standard error, 0.02) kilobases and 6.52
(standard error, 0.02) kilobases, respectively; P < 0.001).
Women with greater amounts of accelerometer-measured
sedentary time were more likely to be older, white, and
obese (Table 1). They were also more likely to have high
blood pressure, a history of chronic diseases, a lower physi-
cal performance score, and fewer hours/day of MVPA and
to have experienced a fall in the past 12 months. Women
with higher self-reported sedentary time were more likely
to be older, white, and obese and to have a history of
chronic diseases (Table 2). They also had a lower physical
performance
score
and
lower
levels
of
self-reported
MVPA, and they were less likely to be in excellent or very
good health.
In a model adjusting only for wear time, accelerometer-
measured sedentary time was significantly associated with
LTL (Table 3). After further adjustment for age and race/
ethnicity, findings were no longer significant; in addi-
tional models, no significant findings were observed.
After stratifying by the median accelerometer-measured
MVPA value (0.69 hours/day), significant associations
between accelerometer-measured sedentary time and LTL
were not observed among women with MVPA levels
above the median (Table 4). Among women at or below
the median MVPA level, only women in the highest quar-
tile of sedentary time had significantly shorter LTL in the
full-adjustment model. LTL was on average 170 (95%
confidence interval: 4, 340) base pairs shorter in the most
sedentary women than in the least sedentary women.
Although the stratum-specific signal for sedentary time
and LTL was stronger among women at or below the
median MVPA level, there was no significant interaction
between sedentary time and MVPA (Pinteraction = 0.80).
After stratification on a cutpoint of 0.5 hours/day of
MVPA, all P values for trend were significant among
women with less than 0.5 hours/day of MVPA. At a
cutpoint of 0.36 hours/day of MVPA, associations of
accelerometer-measured sedentary time with LTL were
stronger among women with less than 0.36 hours/day of
MVPA; LTL was 369 (95% confidence interval: 60, 679)
base pairs shorter among the most sedentary women than
among the least sedentary women in the full-adjustment
model. Sedentary time was not significantly associated
with LTL among women with ≥0.36 or ≥0.5 hours/day of
MVPA (data not shown).
In the model with no adjustment for covariates, self-
reported sedentary time was significantly associated with
LTL (Table 5). In subsequent models adjusting for age,
race/ethnicity, and other factors, findings were no longer
significant. Results did not vary by level of self-reported
MVPA (data not shown).
Results did not vary by race/ethnicity, by physical per-
formance score, or after exclusion of participants with a
history of cancer (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Among older women who were less physically active as
measured by accelerometry, a greater amount of accelerometer-
measured sedentary time was significantly associated with
shorter LTL. Findings persisted after adjustment for demo-
graphic characteristics, lifestyle behaviors, and body mass
index but were attenuated after adjustment for a history of
chronic diseases and use of hormone therapy. In the full-
adjustment model, LTL was on average 170 base pairs
shorter in the most sedentary women compared with the
least sedentary women. Since women may lose on average
21 base pairs/year (8), this suggests that the most sedentary
women were biologically older by 8 years. Our findings
have important implications for an aging population, in which
greater time spent sedentary and less physical activity tends to
be the norm (23).
We observed that self-reported sedentary time was not
associated with LTL, similar to a previous study of 7,813
Nurses’ Health Study participants who were aged 59 years
on average (12). Although results were not stratified by
physical activity in the Nurses’ Health Study, joint classifi-
cation of sedentary time and physical activity through a
combined variable showed that women who were less
active and more sedentary had shorter LTL than those who
were more active and less sedentary. In a study of 2,401
primarily female white twins aged 49 years, on average,
Cherkas et al. (8) observed that the LTL of inactive partici-
pants was 200 base pairs shorter than that of the most
active participants; however, total sedentary time was not
specifically evaluated. It is difficult to directly compare our
results with those of other studies due to differences in
sample size, methods used to assess sedentary time, the
age ranges of the study populations, and low correlation
between accelerometer-measured and self-reported seden-
tary time. Unlike previous studies, our study focused on
older women and used accelerometer-measured sedentary
time—an important consideration given that time spent
sedentary may be underestimated in self-reported data (15).
An absence of association between self-reported sedentary
time and LTL may, to a large extent, reflect measurement
imprecision in questionnaire assessments of sedentary time,
particularly among older adults.
Although we did not observe a significant statistical
interaction between sedentary time and MVPA, several
studies examining joint associations of sedentary time
and physical activity with adverse health outcomes have
observed that disease and mortality incidence risks associ-
ated with higher sedentary time were either attenuated or

 eliminated among persons engaging in greater amounts of
physical activity and were stronger in those with lower levels
of physical activity (18–21). In our study, accelerometer-
measured sedentary time was not associated with LTL among
women who were more physically active. Additionally, seden-
tary time was not associated with LTL among women meeting
current public health recommendations of ≥30 minutes/day of
MVPA (43); in those not meeting this recommendation, higher
sedentary time was associated with shorter LTL. Our findings
suggest that prolonged sedentary time may be associated
with shorter LTL when adequate levels of MVPA are not
attained. However, our findings should be interpreted with
caution given the lack of a statistical interaction, and further
research is needed to determine whether there is a syner-
gistic association of sedentary time and MVPA with LTL
shortening.
We observed that women spent an average of 9.2 hours/
day sedentary according to accelerometer data, in concor-
dance with other studies carried out among older adults
(44–46). In a study of 7,247 older Women’s Health Study
participants, Shiroma et al. (44) also observed an average
of 9.2 hours/day spent in accelerometer-measured seden-
tary time. In our study, women reported spending an aver-
age of 8.6 hours/day sedentary. This is much higher than
the total self-reported sedentary time observed in previous
studies among older adults, which has ranged from 5.2
hours/day to 6.7 hours/day (23). We also observed that
African-American women spent less time sedentary than
white women. In a previous study carried out in a national
sample of adults, Matthews et al. (47) observed that white
and African-American women had similar patterns of sed-
entary behavior; however, older adults were not specifically
evaluated.
Several mechanisms may explain the association of sed-
entary time with LTL. Oxidative stress and inflammation
accelerate telomere attrition (2, 11, 48). It has been shown
that regular engagement in physical activity increases anti-
oxidant activity and may induce antiinflammatory re-
sponses (49, 50). Therefore, it is possible that women who
spend long hours sedentary coupled with less time in
MVPA may not be exposed to these antioxidant and antiin-
flammatory defenses. Increased time spent being sedentary
and inactive may lead to insulin resistance (51), which has
been previously associated with short LTL (52). The asso-
ciation of sedentary time with LTL may also be due to
mediation by obesity. In previous studies, engaging in high
amounts
of
sedentary
behavior
was
associated
with
increased risk of obesity (25), and obesity has been associ-
ated with shorter LTL (7); however, findings persisted after
adjustment for body mass index. Reverse causation due to
chronic disease burden may also be possible; that is,
women who have a history of chronic diseases may be
more likely to have a sedentary lifestyle and shorter LTL.
Limitations of our study included its cross-sectional
design, which precluded our ability to assess a temporal
relationship between sedentary time and LTL. Our study
was exclusive to older women, and our findings cannot be
generalized to men or younger women. Our results apply
to telomere length dynamics in leukocytes but not in other
tissues. Women who enrolled in the WHI extension studies
were more likely to be healthier at baseline; thus, those
who experienced greater health-related LTL shortening
may have been excluded. Strengths of our study include
the diverse sample, adjustment for a large number of poten-
tial confounders, adjudication of data on chronic diseases,
and accelerometer-measured sedentary time and MVPA.
In conclusion, higher accelerometer-measured sedentary
time was associated with shorter LTL among less physically
active women, suggesting that prolonged sedentary time
and limited engagement in MVPA may act synergistically

 to shorten LTL among older women. Therefore, avoidance
of a highly inactive lifestyle may provide health benefits at
the cellular level. Longitudinal studies assessing sedentary
time and MVPA in relation to changes in LTL are currently
needed. Future studies should also determine whether
cardiorespiratory fitness modifies the relationship between
sedentary time and LTL (53).
