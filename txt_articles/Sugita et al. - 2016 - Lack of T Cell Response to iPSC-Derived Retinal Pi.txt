SUMMARY
Allografts of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells have been considered for the treatment of ocular diseases. We recently started the
transplantation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPE cells for patients with age-related macular degeneration (autogenic
grafts). However, there are at least two problems with this approach: (1) high cost, and (2) uselessness for acute patients. To resolve these
issues, we established RPE cells from induced iPSCs in HLA homozygote donors. In vitro, human T cells directly recognized allogeneic
iPSC-derived RPE cells that expressed HLA class I/II antigens. However, these T cells failed to respond to HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1-matched
iPSC-derived RPE cells from HLA homozygous donors. Because of the lack of T cell response to iPSC-derived RPE cells from HLA
homozygous donors, we can use these allogeneic iPSC-derived RPE cells in future clinical trials if the recipient and donor are HLA
matched.
INTRODUCTION
Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells play an important
role in maintaining the immune privileged status of the
eye. RPE cells have both proliferative and anti-prolifera-
tive effects on T cells, and these effects are regulated by
cytokines (Streilein, 2003; Sugita, 2009). Interferon-g
(IFN-g) inflammatory cytokines are upregulated in immu-
nological processes such as transplant rejection (Huber
and Irschick, 1988). IFN-g induces the expression of
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II
(MHC-I, MHC-II) molecules on RPE cells (Enzmann
et al., 1999; Sugita et al., 2009). T lymphocytes and in-
flammatory cytokines play the central effector role in
cellular immune reactions including immune rejection.
In addition to effective antigen recognition, the activa-
tion of these cells causes the secretion of inflammatory
cytokines, i.e., IFN-g. A complex network of helper
CD4+
T cells
(Th cells)
is
then
initiated,
and
the
lymphatic
cell
proliferation
and
immune
reactions
continue. This cascade may play a role in the rejection
of allogeneic RPE transplants in the eye. Modulation of
the transplanted cells leads to secretion of inflammatory
cytokines that attract T cells and cause immune rejection.
Therefore, the investigation of rejection mechanisms is
important for the prevention of this process and pro-
longed graft survival.
RPE cell-associated allografts have been considered for
the treatment of ocular diseases such as age-related ma-
cular degeneration (AMD). We successfully established
human RPE cells from human iPSCs (Kamao et al.,
2014; Sugita et al., 2015). In addition, we recently trans-
planted an iPSC-derived RPE (iPS-RPE) sheet into an
AMD patient autograft. RPE cells including iPS-RPE cells
have immunosuppressive properties; human RPE cells
suppress T cell activation and can convert T cells to regu-
latory T cells (Horie et al., 2010; Imai et al., 2012; Sugita
et al., 2015; Usui et al., 2008). However, several groups
in human clinical trials found that RPE allografts did
not survive because of immune rejection (Algvere, 1997;
Algvere et al., 1999; Peyman et al., 1991; Weisz et al.,
1999). Algvere et al. (1999) reported that immune rejec-
tion after RPE transplantation in humans includes loss
of visual function over the transplant, development of
an exudative response (e.g., serous retinal detachment),
fluorescein leakage of the grafts, disruption of the grafts,
depigmentation of the grafts, and encapsulation of the
grafts. However, there have been no previous reports of
how antigen and cell type affect the outcome of the
retinal transplantation. In addition, as far as we know,
no one has reported that RPE cells derived from embry-
onic stem cells (ESCs)/iPSCs are recognized by MHC-
restricted immune cells, especially T cells.
Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to deter-
mine whether human RPE cells derived from iPSCs could
be
recognized
by
human
leukocyte
antigen
(HLA)-
restricted T cells. We used an in vitro model with human
iPS-RPE cells from HLA-3 locus (A, B, DRB1) homozygote
donors as target cells and allogeneic T cells as responder
effector cells.

 RESULTS
Expression of HLA Class I and II on iPSC-Derived
RPE Cells
To confirm the expression of HLA molecules on human iPS-
RPE cells, wepreparedseveraliPS-RPEcell lines(Kamaoetal.,
2014; Sugita et al., 2015) and human control cells (ESC-
derived RPE cells, ARPE-19 cell lines, fetal primary RPE cells,
cornea endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and iPSCs). First, we
examined the expression of HLA class I and II on iPS-RPE
cells by flow cytometry. The iPS-RPE cells constitutively
expressed HLA class I (A, B, C), but not class II (DR, DP,
DQ, Figure 1A). IFN-g-pretreated iPS-RPE cells expressed
HLA class II, but interleukin-17A/F (IL-17A/F)-treated or tu-
mor necrosis factor a (TNF-a)-treated cells did not. Conven-
tional human RPE cell lines (ARPE-19) had similar results
(data not shown). Other RPE cell lines also did not express
class II under normal conditions, but class II expression
was induced in the presence of IFN-g (Figure S1). The expres-
sionpatternincontrolhumanRPEcells,suchasESC-derived
RPE cells, ARPE-19 cells, and fetal RPE cells, and other con-
trol cells (cornea endothelial cells and fibroblasts) was
similar. However, iPSCs did not express HLA class II mole-
cules even when IFN-g was added to the culture (Figure S1).
During culture, the expression pattern of class I and II mol-
ecules in iPS-RPE cells was similar, but a slightly different
(Figure S2). For example, iPS-RPE cells at the early stage
(p1, day 14) expressed high levels of HLA class II when
IFN-g was added to the culture, but the expression was
downregulated during the culture (p4, day 90). Importantly,
the expression of HLA-DR on iPS-RPE cells was upregulated
when the cells were pretreated with IFN-g, but not with
other recombinant proteins (IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12,
IL-17A/F, IL-22, IL-23, TNF-a, transforming growth factor
b2 [TGF-b2], granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating
factor [GM-CSF], IL-8, MIG, MCP-1 [Figure 1B], IL-10, IL-
21, IL-27, TGF-b1, TNFRI, macrophage migration inhibitory
factor, thrombospondin, and lipopolysaccharide; data not
shown). The expression of HLA-DR in the presence of
IFN-g was upregulated in a cytokine dose-dependent
manner (Figure 1C), and iPS-RPE cells exposed to superna-
tants from activated Tcells,butnotfrom naive Tcells, clearly
expressed HLA-DR (Figure 1D). Taken together, our experi-
mental evidence indicates that HLA molecules are uniquely
expressed on thesurface of RPE cells,including iPS-RPE cells.
HLA Molecule Disparity between Lymphocytes and
Allogeneic iPS-RPE Cells Induces Immune Responses
We confirmed that the HLA mismatch between peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and allogeneic iPS-RPE
cells was sufficient to elicit allogeneic immune responses.
We summarized the results of HLA-typing tests for
HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1, and -DPB1, in Tcells collected
from healthy volunteers (n = 26, Table S1). MHC disparity
between T cells and allogeneic iPS-RPE cells was previously
shown to induce immune responses in animal models
(Kamao et al., 2014). PBMCs from healthy donors were
cultured with human iPS-RPE cells from the same donor
(autogenic) or another donor (allogeneic). In a PBMC-RPE
mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay, the PBMCs prolif-
erated in vitro when co-cultured with allogeneic 454E2 iPS-
RPE cells, as well as allogeneic B cells (positive control cells:
Figure 2A). On the other hand, the PBMCs did not prolifer-
ate when co-cultured with allogeneic iPSCs (data not
shown). PBMCs from a TLHD1 donor did not induce prolif-
eration of TLHD1 iPS-RPE cells, whereas the PBMCs
induced proliferation when co-cultured with allogeneic
454E2 iPS-RPE cells and ARPE-19 cells (Figure 2B). Alloge-
neic proliferation did not occur between TLHD21 or
TLHD10 PBMCs and 454E2 RPE cells with completely
matched HLA class I and II (HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1), whereas
the PBMCs responded to other HLA-mismatched RPE cells
(Figures 2B, S3A, and S3B). In addition, PBMCs from
TLHD15, TLHD23, and TLHD24 donors proliferated when
HLA homozygote iPS-RPE cells (454E2 and 453F2) and
RPE cell lines were added to the cultures (Figure S3A).
iPS-RPE Cells from HLA Homozygote iPSCs Do Not
Respond to HLA-Matched Allogeneic Immune Cells
In Vitro
Next, we examined what kind of cell proliferates in
cultures of PBMCs plus iPS-RPE cells. For the assay, we used
Figure 1. Expression of HLA Class I and II on human iPSC-Derived RPE Cells
(A) iPS-RPE cells (836B1) were stained with anti-HLA class I antibody (A, B, C) or class II antibody (DR, DQ, DP). iPS-RPE cells in the
presence of recombinant IFN-g, IL-17A/F, or TNF-a were cultured for 48 hr (red). Numbers in the graphs indicate mean fluorescence
intensity (MFI). Isotype control is shown in blue.
(B) iPS-RPE cells (454E2) were cultured with human recombinant proteins, such as IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17A/F, IL-22, IL-23,
TNF-a, TGFb2, GM-CSF, IL-8/CXCL8, MIG/CXCL9, and MCP-1/CCL2, for 48 hr, and the cells were stained with anti-HLA-DR antibodies. We
obtained similar results with anti-human HLA-DR, -DP, and -DQ antibodies.
(C) 454E2 iPS-RPE cells were cultured with recombinant IFN-g in a dose-dependent manner (0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 ng/mL), and the cells were
stained with anti-HLA-DR antibody. Numbers in parentheses indicate MFI.
(D) iPS-RPE cells exposed to supernatants from activated T cells (agonistic anti-CD3 antibody-treated) or naive T cells were stained with
anti-HLA-DR antibodies. Numbers in parentheses indicate MFI.

 anti-human Ki-67 antibody (a cell proliferation marker) in
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. In the
MLR assay with fresh PBMCs all cell types in PBMCs prolif-
erated, except CD11b+ cells, when co-cultured with alloge-
neic B cells as a positive control compared with PBMCs
only (Figure S4). The target B cells greatly expressed HLA
class I, class II, CD40, CD80 (B7-1), and CD86 (B7-2) mole-
cules (data not shown). By contrast, CD4+ cells (Th cells),
CD8+ cells (cytotoxic T cells), CD11b+ cells (macrophages/
monocytes), CD19+ cells (B cells), and CD56+ cells (natural
killer [NK] cells) in TLHD1 PBMCs failed to proliferate
when co-cultured with autogenic RPE cells (Figure S4).
In the PBMC-RPE MLR assay with allogeneic HLA homo-
zygote iPS-RPE cells (454E2 and Ff-I01), these immune cells
in PBMCs (TLHD10) failed to proliferate when co-cultured
with HLA-matched allogeneic iPS-RPE cells (HLA-A, -B,
and -DRB1 matched: Figure 3A). However, these immune
cells in PBMCs (TLHD14) induced the proliferation of
HLA-mismatched iPS-RPE cells (TLHD1 and Ff-I01), i.e.,
all inflammatory cell types, especially CD4+ and CD8+
T cells, responded to TLHD1 iPS-RPE cells (all HLA mis-
matched) compared with PBMCs only (Figure 3B). More-
over, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in a TLHD14 donor responded
to Ff-I01 RPE lines that were HLA-A matched and HLA-B,
-DRB1 mismatched. We had similar results with TLHD21
donor PBMCs plus HLA-mismatched TLHD1 RPE cells and
HLA-matched Ff-I01 RPE cells; CD4 + and CD8+ T cells in
TLHD21 donor PBMCs failed to respond to Ff-I01 RPE, but
CD4+ and CD8+ Tcells highly responded to TLHD1 RPE cells
in vitro (Figure S5). These results imply that T lymphocytes
may recognize MHC molecules on allogeneic iPS-RPE cells
and then proliferate. However, an immune response cannot
be induced in the PBMC-RPE MLR assay when the lympho-
cytes and RPE cells are HLA matched.
CD4+ T Cells Can Recognize HLA Molecules on
Allogeneic iPS-RPE Cells, but Not MHC-Matched
RPE Cells
We next examined whether the RPE-direct recognition by
T cells occurred in an HLA-restricted manner. We used pu-
rified CD4+ Tcells co-cultured with iPS-RPE cells in the pres-
ence of recombinant IL-2 for a CD4-RPE cytokine assay.
HLA homozygote 454E2 iPS-RPE cells and CD4+ T cells
were co-cultured, and the supernatants were collected for
48 hr to measure the inflammatory cytokines.
We first examined which cytokines are released at high
concentrations in the direct reactions between CD4+
Tcells and allogeneic iPS-RPE cells. As revealed in Figure 4A,
supernatants from the cultures of 454E2 iPS-RPE cells and
CD4+ T cells (a TLHD1 MHC-mismatched donor) con-
tained significant levels of IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-1RA, IL-4, IL-6,
IL-12p70, GM-CSF, TNF-a, TNF-b, and IFN-g, compared
with that of T cells only or T cells exposed to autogenic
TLHD1 RPE cells. When CD4+ T cells were prepared from
an MHC-matched donor TLHD21 to 454E2 RPE cells, the
T cells did not respond to the RPE cells. The T cells did
not produce inflammatory cytokines, especially Th1-
related cytokines (IL-1b, IL-12p70, GM-CSF, TNF-a, TNF-
b, and IFN-g), although the T cells are able to produce these
cytokines in the presence of 453F2 RPE cells that are
MHC-mismatched MHC homozygote cell lines (Figure 4A).
These T cells in the cultures do not produce IL-7, IL-15,
IL-31, or IFN-a (data not shown).
We next examined whether T cells exposed to allogeneic
iPS-RPE cells can exhibit the Th1 phenotype. In qRT-PCR
analysis, PBMCs in the presence of iPS-RPE cells expressed
higher levels of mRNA for Th1-related genes such as T-bet,
Stat1, IFN-g, and CXCR3 compared with PBMCs alone
without RPE cells (Figure 4B).
We then confirmed these results by performing FACS
analysis with antibodies for Th1 cytokines, IFN-g, IL-2,
and TNF-a. Compared with control cultures (T cells
without iPS-RPE cells), CD4+ T cells exposed to 454E2
iPS-RPE cells expressed IFN-g, IL-2, and TNF-a (Figure 5A).
However, TLHD21 T cells failed to express IFN-g (but not
IL-2 and TNF-a) when co-cultured with MHC-matched
RPE cells (Figure 5B). Therefore, we chose IFN-g evaluation
for the following experiments.
CD4+ T Cells Cannot Recognize HLA-DRB1-Matched
Allogeneic iPS-RPE Cells from HLA Homozygous
Donors
To examine the allogeneic recognition of T cells to HLA ho-
mozygous iPS-RPE cells, we next prepared CD4+ T cells
from several healthy volunteers. First, we confirmed that
CD4+ T cells recognize autogenic iPS-RPE cells. TLHD1
T cells did not produce IFN-g when co-cultured with
TLHD1 RPE cells, and the Tcells produced significant levels
of IFN-g without RPE cells (control culture, Figure 6A). On
the other hand, TLHD3 T cells recognized TLHD1 iPS-RPE
Figure 2. Lymphocyte Reactions of Allogeneic iPSC-Derived RPE Cells: PBMC-RPE MLR Assay
(A) CFSE-labeled PBMCs with iPS-RPE cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. iPS-RPE cells (target cells, 454E2 from HLA homozygote
donors) or B cells (a positive control) were co-cultured with PBMCs (effector cells) from a TLHD1 donor for 120 hr (effector/target ratio =
200:1, 100:1, or 50:1).
(B) RPE cells (454E2 iPS-RPE, TLHD1 iPS-RPE, and ARPE-19 cells) were co-cultured with PBMCs from a TLHD1 donor (left panels) or a
TLHD21 donor (right panels). The TLHD21 donor was completely matched for HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 in 454E2 iPS-RPE cells, and the TLHD1
donor was mismatched. Numbers in the histogram indicate CFSE-positive cells.

 Figure 3. Another PBMC-RPE MLR Assay with Alloge-
neic iPS-RPE Cells by Ki-67 Proliferation
To evaluate the PBMC-RPE MLR assay with allogeneic HLA
homozygote iPS-RPE cells (454E2, 453F2, and Ff-I01)
and B cells as positive control cells, we used Ki-67 pro-
liferation by FACS analysis using antibodies against CD4+
cells (helper T cells), CD8+ cells (cytotoxic T cells),
CD11b+ cells (macrophages/monocytes), CD19+ cells
(B cells), and CD56+ (NK cells).

HLA-A, -B, -DRB1 mismatched, and Ff-I01 iPS-RPE

matched.

 cells (HLA mismatched), and the T cells produced signifi-
cant amounts of IFN-g. Unlike TLHD1 RPE cells, TLHD1
T cells greatly produced IFN-g when co-cultured with
HLA-mismatched 454E2 RPE cells (Figure 6B). Importantly,
there was a statistically significant difference between
T cells and RPE cells, but the extent of the difference was
reduced when we added anti-CD3 antibody (first signal
blocking) to the cultures (Figure 6B). On the other hand,
there was no difference between T cells and RPE cells
when TLHD10 T cells were co-cultured with 454E2 RPE
cells (HLA-A, -B, -DRB1 matched) in the presence or
absence of anti-CD3 antibody (Figure 6C). Moreover, we
obtained similar results when using other HLA homozy-
gote lines 453F2 (Figure 6D) and human RPE cell lines (Fig-
ure 6E). These results suggest that T cells directly recognize
MHC molecules on RPE cells via the first signal.
To confirm the ratio of T cells to RPE cells in the cultures,
we prepared 5 3 105 T cells and from 1 3 103 (500:1) to
5 3 105 RPE cells (1:1). T cells significantly produced
IFN-g in an RPE cell number-dependent manner, whereas
T cell activation was suppressed with 5 3 105 confluent
RPE cells (Figure 6F), indicating that human RPE cells also
have anti-inflammatory properties (Horie et al., 2010;
Imai et al., 2012; Sugita et al., 2015; Usui et al., 2008).
To confirm these results, we prepared T cells from several
HLA-mismatched donors. Representative results indicate
that supernatants contained significant levels of IFN-g in
the T cell RPE cultures when the tested T cells were mis-
matched to HLA class II (DRB1) of 454E2 RPE cells (Figures
S6A and S6B) or 453F2 RPE cells (Figures S6D and S6F). In
contrast, the RPE recognition by T cells was reduced if the
tested T cells (TLHD4 or TLHD6) matched the HLA-DRB1
on these RPE cells (Figures S6C and S6E). These results sug-
gest that CD4+ helper Tcells can recognize MHC molecules,
probably HLA class II such as HLA-DRB1, on allogeneic
iPS-RPE cells. We summarize the results of the T cell
response to MHC homozygote 454E2 iPS-RPE cells in Table
S2. In the tested donors, six types of T cells from TLHD6
(HLA-B*52:01
and
DRB1*15:02
matched),
TLHD10
(HLA-A*24:02,
B*52:01,
and
DRB1*15:02
matched),
TLHD11 (HLA-A*24:02 matched), TLHD18 (HLA-B*52:01
and DRB1*15:02 matched), TLHD19 (HLA-DRB1*15:02
matched),
and
TLHD21
(HLA-A*24:02,
B52:01,
and
DRB1*15:02 matched) did not respond to the RPE cells
in vitro.
To confirm this finding, we examined whether CD4+
T cells can recognize allogeneic iPS-RPE cells in the pres-
ence of anti-HLA class II (MHC-II) blocking antibody.
T cells significantly produced IFN-g when co-cultured
with 454E2 RPE cells, but the T cells failed to respond
when anti-HLA class II antibodies were added to the cul-
tures (Figure 7A). In addition, FACS analysis exhibited
similar results (Figure 7B). These results indicate that the
helper T cell response to allogeneic iPS-RPE cells is HLA
class II restricted.
We next examined whether T cells are able to recognize
iPSCs in vitro. First, we examined the expression of HLA
class II (MHC-II) on human iPSCs, 454E2 homozygote
lines. The iPSCs did not express HLA class II even when
IFN-g was added to the culture (Figure 7C). In an in vitro
rejection assay using iPSCs, CD4+ T cells produced less
IFN-g even if co-cultured with allogeneic iPSCs (Figure 7C).
In contrast, T cells produced large amounts of IFN-g when
co-cultured with allogeneic iPS-RPE cells or human skin
fibroblasts (both from a 454E2 donor). Therefore, it is
assumed that RPE cells are highly immunogenic compared
with iPSCs.
We also examined whether IFN-g-pretreated RPE cells
have more immunogenicity because these iPS-RPE cells in-
ducibly express HLA class II (see Figure 1). As expected,
supernatants from T-RPE cultures contained high levels of
IFN-g when 454E2 or 453F2 RPE cells were pretreated
with recombinant IFN-g, compared with the results for un-
treated RPE cells (Figure S7A). We also verified that the Tcell
recognition is required for antigen-presenting cell (APC)
immunity. Autogenic APCs were used in the CD4-RPE
rejection assay. T cells produced significant amounts of
IFN-g in cultures of 454E2 RPE cells with or without
APCs, but there was more effective production when
APCs were added (Figure S7B). These results imply that
T cell recognition by RPE cells might be required for APC
activation.
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we prepared human RPE cells derived
from iPSCs as stimulators and T cells as responders to eval-
uate immune rejection in vitro. The ability of RPE cells to
stimulate the bystander T cells was analyzed using MLR
and IFN-g production by T cells. In some experiments,
APCs and anti-CD3 antibody (first signal blocking) were
also used for the in vitro rejection assay. For the assay, we
used T cell culture medium containing recombinant hu-
man IL-2. IL-2 is a growth factor for all subpopulations of
T cells and acts as an antigen-nonspecific factor in the pro-
liferation of these T cells. Th1 cells produce IL-2 as well as
IFN-g. The MLR assay is a useful tool with which to inves-
tigate
the
mechanisms
of
allogeneic
responsiveness
in vitro (allo-MLR) including the response to RPE cells (Ka-
mao et al., 2014). In addition, we purified CD4+ T cells co-
cultured with iPS-RPE cells in the presence of recombinant
IL-2. To evaluate the recognition of T cells, we collected the
supernatants to measure inflammatory cytokines such as
IFN-g for CD4+ T cells. We then analyzed whether the
T cell recognition of RPE cells was HLA restricted. In this

 study, we focused on HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 among the six
HLA loci antigens, although we tested all six HLA geno-
types, A, B, C, DRB1, DQB1, and DPB1, in PBMCs and
RPE cells.
Retinal allografts have been considered for the treatment
of ocular disease, and there is extensive evidence that allo-
grafts can survive in the retina without immunosuppression
(Algvere et al., 1999). However, we previously showed that
allogeneic transplants of iPS-RPE cells in animal models
could elicit immune responses in the retina (Kamao et al.,
2014), and several groups found that RPE allografts did not
survive in human clinical trials (Algvere, 1997; Algvere
et al., 1999; Peyman et al., 1991; Weisz et al., 1999). There
have been no previous reports of how antigen (including
MHC antigen) and cell type affect the outcome of retinal
transplantation. In humans, allogeneic cell transplants
almost always include a short course of immunosuppres-
sion, commonly cyclosporine A or tacrolimus, to minimize
the chances of graft rejection through a T cell-mediated
adaptive
immune
response
(Clipstone
and
Crabtree,
1992). Eventuallywemightbeable tocontrolimmunerejec-
tion by using T cell-specific medication. In addition, in
immunohistochemistry with retinal sections, many T cells
had invaded the retina after transplantation of iPS-RPE
cells/sheets (allografts) in animal models, whereas control
retinal sections examined by immunohistochemistry had
no T cells in the retina (our unpublished data). Therefore,
the T cell-mediated immune response plays a critical role
in the pathogenesis of immune rejection after allogeneic
RPE transplantation. As revealed in the present study,
T cells exposed to iPS-RPE cells exhibited a Th1-type
response (IFN-g+ IL-2+ IL-1b+ T-bet+ STAT1+ CXCR3+). In
fact, RPE cells, especially IFN-g-treated RPE cells, can pro-
duce Th1-related chemokines (IFN-g-related chemokines)
such as CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 (Juel et al., 2012).
We have confirmed that established iPS-RPE cells consti-
tutively express MHC-I but not MHC-II. However, the cyto-
kines produced acutely in response to immune rejection
may upregulate RPE MHC-II expression, as seen in vitro.
This upregulation may be sufficient to initiate a recogni-
tion response in vivo, and it seems that infiltrating T cells
would be strongly activated by the presentation of allospe-
cific MHC. Since MHC-II was inducibly expressed by IFN-g-
treated RPE cells, but not by other cytokine-treated cells, it
is assumed that the unique MHC-II expression on RPE cells
might be IFN-g specific, as shown in this study. In addition,
RPE cells have been reported to act as APCs in the retina
(Percopo et al., 1990). In previous reports (Drukker et al.,
2002; Suarez-Alvarez et al., 2010), human iPSCs/ESCs
have low MHC-I expression, undetectable MHC-II expres-
sion, and no expression of CD80 (B7-1)/CD86 (B7-2) co-
stimulatory molecules, suggesting that the human iPSCs/
ESCs have a limited capacity for antigen processing and
presentation. However, RPE cells, including differentiated
cells from human iPSCs, expressed MHC-I, MHC-II, and
several co-stimulatory molecules (B7-H1, B7-H3, and
B7-H5; data not shown), and the expression of these
antigens in RPE cells determines the outcome of alloan-
tigen-specific T cell responses in vitro.
Compared with the rejection of other graft types, corneal
allograft rejection is delayed and less frequent, in part
because the normal cornea lacks MHC-II-expressing APCs
(Hamrah et al., 2002). Human RPE cells have a similar
phenotype as corneal cells. As shown in the present study,
iPS-RPE cells do not express MHC-II, and they constitu-
tively express MHC-I. During the stress of immune rejec-
tion, MHC-II molecules are expressed by RPE cells, making
these MHC-II-positive retinal cells potential targets for
CD4+ effector T cells, especially Th1 cells. After the activa-
tion of helper T cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) can
be activated by inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2 and
IFN-g, which are produced by Th1 cells. Eventually, CTLs
attack and kill the target cells that express MHC-I. To avoid
immune rejection without strong immunosuppression for
successful transplantation, we should use HLA homozy-
gous RPE cell lines to match the recipient. As revealed in
the present study, HLA disparity between Tcells and alloge-
neic iPS-RPE cells can induce immune responses, i.e., MLRs

Homozygote iPS-RPE Cells
(A) Supernatants of CD4+ T cells (a TLHD1 donor) exposed to TLHD1 iPS-RPE cells (autogenic) or 454E2 iPS-RPE cells (allogeneic) were
collected for a multiplex cytokine array assay (IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-1RA, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-13, GM-CSF, TNF-a, TNF-b, and IFN-g).
In addition, data from TLHD21 CD4+ T cells plus 454E2 iPS-RPE cells (allogeneic reaction, but HLA-A, -B, -DRB1 matched) or 453F2 iPS-RPE
cells (allogeneic reaction, HLA-A, -B, -DRB1 mismatched) are also presented. Data represent the mean ± SEM of three independent ex-
periments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005, ***p < 0.0005 compared with the positive control (CD4+ T cells alone, open bars). ND, not detected.

exposed to allogeneic iPS-RPE cells (453F2 MHC homozygote lines). PBMCs without RPE cells were also prepared as a control. For PCR
amplification, cDNA was amplified by using primers for T-bet (transcription factors T box), Stat1 (signal transducer and activator of
transcription 1), CXCR3 (chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 3), IFN-g, and b-actin. Results indicate the relative expression of the molecules
(DDCt for control PBMCs = 1). We obtained similar results with other iPS-RPE cell lines (836B1 and 454E2). Data represent the mean ± SEM
of three independent experiments. *p < 0.05 compared with the control (PBMCs alone, open bars).

 (allogeneic) and T cell activation (production of infla-
mmatory cytokines). However, the HLA-restricted immune
reaction did not occur when iPS-RPE cells from HLA
homozygous donors were used. Although a more detailed
analysis is needed with a large number of target cells (RPE
cells) and effector cells (T cells or PBMCs), we note that
effector T cells can recognize MHC molecules on allogeneic
iPS-RPE cells, and the immune reaction by the Tcells can be
prevented after HLA blood tests.
In conclusion, T lymphocytes cannot recognize HLA
molecules on allogeneic iPS-RPE cells established from
HLA homozygote donors, as well as autogenic iPS-RPE cells
in vitro. We plan to transplant human iPS-RPE cells using
HLA homozygote allografts in our next clinical trial, and
are now examining the HLA phenotype in patients with
ocular retinal diseases such as AMD.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Establishment of Human iPSCs
After informed consent was obtained, iPSCs (454E2, 453F2, and
TLHD1) were established from skin fibroblasts or dental pulp cells
of a patient with retinitis pigmentosa or a healthy donor by using
an episomal vector of several genes, OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, L-MYC,
LIN28, and p53 small hairpin RNA (Sugita et al., 2015). iPSCs were
established from dermal fibroblasts of a patient with retinitis pig-
mentosa (101G26) or a healthy donor (836B1) by using an
episomal vector of six genes, OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, L-MYC,
LIN28, and GLIS1 (Sugita et al., 2015). Ff-I01 iPSCs (Okita et al.,
2013) were also established from healthy donor PBMCs by pCE-
hSK, pCE-hUL, pCE-hOCT3/4, pCE-mp53DD, and pCXB-EBNA1.
101G26, 836B1, and TLHD1 iPSCs were established from HLA
heterozygous donors, and 454E2, 453F2, and Ff-I01 iPSCs were es-
tablished from HLA homozygous donors. The research followed
the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study was
approved by the Institutional Ethics Committees of the Center
for Developmental Biology, RIKEN.
Preparation of iPSC-Derived RPE Cells
To differentiate into RPE cells, we cultured human iPSCs on
gelatin-coated dishes using Glasgow’s minimal essential medium
(GMEM) supplemented as previously described (Kamao et al.,
2014; Sugita et al., 2015). Signal inhibitors Y-27632 (10 mM,
Wako), SB431542 (5 mM, Sigma), and CKI-7 (3 mM, Sigma) were
added to the GMEM (Kamao et al., 2014; Sugita et al., 2015). After
the appearance of pigment epithelium-like colonies, the medium
was switched to DMEM/F12 medium with B27 supplement
(Invitrogen). iPS-RPE cells expressed specific makers for primary
RPE cells such as RPE65, bestrophin, MiTF, ZO-1, TGF-b1, -b2,
and -b3, pigment epithelium-derived factor, and vascular endothe-
lial growth factor (Kamao et al., 2014; Sugita et al., 2015).
HLA Typing
HLA typing (A, B, C, DRB1, DQB1, and DPB1) of human iPS-RPE
cells, control cells, or blood of healthy donors was performed
with
PCR
reverse
sequence-specific
oligonucleotide
probes
using LABType SSO (One Lambda) or WAKFlow (Wakunaga Phar-
maceutical) (Okita et al., 2011). The results of HLA-allele typing
of blood from healthy donors are shown in Table S1. HLA-allele

Preparation of T Cells and Antigen-Presenting Cells
T cells were established from autogenic or allogeneic T cells from
PBMCs. CD4+ T cells were prepared separately by using separation
beads (MACS cell isolation kit, Miltenyi Biotec). These cells were
more than 94% CD4-positive. These T cells were co-cultured
with RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(BioWhittaker), human recombinant IL-2 (Becton Dickinson),
10 mM HEPES (Sigma), 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids (Sigma),
1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma), penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco),
and 1 3 10�5 M 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). APCs from PBMCs
of healthy donors were also prepared. The X-irradiated APCs
(20 Gy) were cultured with T cells plus iPS-RPE cells in some
experiments.
Mixed Lymphocyte Reactions with iPS-RPE Cells
After informed consent was obtained, PBMCs were isolated from
healthy donors, and allogeneic immune responses were assessed
for proliferation by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE;
Cayman Chemical) incorporation by the PBMCs. CFSE-labeled
PBMCs were cultured with iPS-RPE cells (454E2, 453F2, Ff-I01,
and TLHD1) and ARPE-19 cell lines. As a positive control,
Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells from a healthy donor that
are HLA class I+, HLA class II+, CD40+, B7-1 (CD80)+, and B7-2
(CD86)+ were also prepared. The culture medium used was RPMI-
1640. Before the assay, the target RPE cells or B cells were irradiated
(20 Gy). After 96–120 hr, CFSE-labeled PBMCs were washed and
analyzed by flow cytometry. The PBMC-RPE MLR assay in monkey
cells was also performed using similar methods (Kamao et al.,
2014).
In the Ki-67 proliferation assay by FACS analysis, the following
antibodies were used: anti-human CD4 (BioLegend, catalog

(FITC) (BioLegend, #400208), mouse IgG1, k isotype control
APC, and mouse IgG1 (BioLegend, #400122), k isotype control
phycoerythrin (PE) (BioLegend, #400112). The harvested PBMCs
and PBMCs co-cultured with human iPS-RPE cells (or B cells)
were stained with these antibodies at 4�C for 30 min. For intracel-
lular staining by Ki-67, staining was performed after cell fixation
and permeabilization (BioLegend). All samples were analyzed on
a FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD). Data were analyzed by using
FlowJo software (version 9.3.1).

103 cells/well: effector/target ratio = 100:1) for 48 hr. T cell activa-
tion was assessed for IFN-g production (R&D Systems) by the
CD4+ T cells. The target iPS-RPE cells were prepared from three
HLA homozygote cell lines, 454E2, 453F2, and Ff-I01, and three
HLA heterozygote cell lines, TLHD1, 836B1, and 101G26. As
controls, human iPSCs (454E2), human fibroblasts (454E2), and
human RPE cell lines (ARPE-19) were also prepared for the assay.

cells. Anti-human CD3 antibody (1 mg/mL; Ancell, #144-020)
was also used in the CD4-RPE rejection assay.
Flow Cytometry
Expression of MHC-I (HLA-A, -B, -C) and MHC-II (HLA-DR, -DQ,

(ES-RPE cells, ARPE-19 cell lines, primary fetal RPE cells, cornea
endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and 836B1 or 454E2 iPSCs) was exam-
ined by FACS analysis. Before staining, these cells were incubated
with a human Fc block (Miltenyi Biotec) at 4�C for 15 min. The
cells were stained with anti-HLA class I antibody (FITC anti-human
HLA-A, -B, -C; Sigma-Aldrich, #F 5662), anti-HLA class II antibody
(FITC anti-human HLA-DR, -DP, -DQ; DakoCytomation, #F0817 or

30 min. iPS-RPE cells or control cells co-cultured with recombinant
IFN-g (100 ng/mL) for 48 hr were also prepared. RPE cells were also
treated with other recombinant proteins and supernatants of
T cells (agonistic anti-human CD3 antibody-treated activated
T cells or naive untreated T cells). We used recombinant human
proteins such as IL-1b (50 ng/mL; R&D Systems), IL-2 (100 U/ml;

these cytokines, cells were pre-stimulated with T cell-stimulation
materials (CytoStim, Miltenyi Biotec) for 1–2 hr, and cells were
incubated for an additional 5 hr in the presence of a protein
transport inhibitor (BD GolgiStop, BD). After Fc block staining,

Multiplex Cytokine Array
Supernatants of CD4+ T cells (from TLHD1 or TLHD21 donors)
exposed to TLHD1, 454E2, or 453F2 iPS-RPE cells were prepared
for multiplex cytokine array assay (Procarta Immunoassay Kit,
Filgen). The following 16 factors were measured: IL-1a, IL-1b,
IL-1RA, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-31, GM-CSF,
TNF-a, TNF-b, IFN-a, and IFN-g. A significant concentration
for each cytokine is >10.0 pg/mL, and the undetectable level is
<1.0 pg/mL. The assay was performed twice, and the supernatants
were measured in triplicate each time that the assay was
performed.
qRT-PCR
mRNA expression for Th1-related genes such as T-bet, Stat1, IFN-g,
and CXCR3 in PBMCs in the presence of iPS-RPE cells was evalu-
ated by qRT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from PBMCs with and
without exposure to iPS-RPE cells (453F2 or 836B1). After cDNA
synthesis, the expression of Th1-related genes and b-actin in
triplicate samples was analyzed by qRT-PCR. The primers were as
follows: tgtggtccaagtttaatcagca (left) and gacaggaatgggaacatcc
(right) for T-bet; tgagttgatttctgtgtctgaagtt (left) and acacctcgt
caaactcctcag (right) for Stat1; ggcattttgaagaattggaaag (left) and
tttggatgctctggtcatctt (right) for IFN-g; and ccatggtccttgaggtgag
(left) and tccatagtcataggaagagctgaa (right) for CXCR3. The probes
(Universal Probe Library) were #9 for T-bet, #32 for Stat1, #21 for
IFN-g, and #79 for CXCR3. The results indicate the relative
expression of the molecules (DDCt for control cells = 1).
Statistical Evaluation
At least three independent experiments were performed for all
in vitro assays. All statistical analyses were performed with the
Student’s t test (paired or unpaired, as appropriate). Values were
considered statistically significant if p was less than 0.05.
