Effect of gargling with tea and ingredients
of tea on the prevention of influenza
infection: a meta-analysis
Kazuki Ide, Hiroshi Yamada* and Yohei Kawasaki
Abstract
Background: Influenza viruses can spread easily from person to person, and annual influenza epidemics are serious
public health issues worldwide. Non-pharmaceutical public health interventions could potentially be effective for
combatting influenza epidemics, but combined interventions and/or interventions with greater effectiveness are
needed. Experimental studies have reported that tea and its ingredients (especially catechins) have antiviral
activities. Although several clinical studies have investigated the use of tea or its ingredients to prevent influenza
infections, the effect of gargling these substances has remained uncertain.
Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies and prospective cohort studies to assess
the effect of gargling with tea and its ingredients on the prevention of influenza infection. The published literature
was searched using the Cochrane Library, PubMed/MEDLINE (1966 to September 2015), Web of Science (1981 to
September 2015), and Ichu-shi Web (1983 to September 2015). The extracted studies were read by two reviewers
independently, and their overall scientific quality was evaluated. Studies meeting our inclusion criteria were pooled
using the Mantel-Haenszel method in a fixed effects model and were also analyzed in a random effects model. The
qualities of the model fits were assessed using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information
criterion (BIC).
Results: The literature search and review identified 5 studies that met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis (total
number of participants, 1890; mean age range, 16–83 years). The participants who gargled with tea or its ingredients
showed a lower risk of influenza infection than did participants who gargled with placebo/water or who did not gargle
(fixed effects model, Mantel-Haenszel method: relative risk [RR] = 0.70, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.54–0.89; random
effects model: RR = 0.71, 95 % CI = 0.56–0.91). The fixed effects model had a better quality of fit than the random
effects model (fixed effects model: AIC = 6.04, BIC = 5.65; random effects model: AIC = 8.74, BIC = 7.52).
Conclusions: Gargling with tea and its ingredients may have a preventative effect for influenza infection. However,
additional large-scale studies in different populations and a pooled analysis of these studies are needed to confirm the
effect.

 Background
Influenza viruses can spread easily from person to person,
and annual epidemics create serious public health prob-
lems worldwide. The World Health Organization esti-
mates that 5 to 10 % of adults and 20 to 30 % of children
are infected by the virus annually, resulting in approxi-
mately 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and 250,000 to
300,000 deaths [1]. Effective preventative measures are
therefore needed to reduce serious cases of influenza.
Vaccination is a commonly used and widely recom-
mended preventive measure for influenza infection [1, 2].
Its effectiveness has been reported in both randomized
controlled trials and meta-analyses [2, 3]. Nonetheless,
there are several drawbacks to vaccinations for influenza
viruses, including the limited supplies of vaccines [4–6]
and their strain-specific effects [2, 3]. The effectiveness
of influenza vaccination may also depend on the charac-
teristics of the vaccinated population [7]. Neuraminidase
inhibitors are also used for influenza prevention, but they
have limited effects and the existence of resistant viruses
has been reported [8, 9]. Therefore, in addition to these
pharmaceutical interventions, non-pharmaceutical public
health interventions are also important for epidemic con-
trol, including measures such as the use of facemasks,
hand hygiene, and gargling [10–12]. One meta-analysis
study reported that a combination of hand hygiene with
facemasks was effective for influenza prevention, even
though hand hygiene was ineffective by itself [13]. Non-
pharmaceutical public health interventions have the po-
tential to be effective, but a combination of these interven-
tions and/or improvements to their effectiveness would be
needed to control influenza.
Tea catechins have been reported to have antiviral ac-
tivities in in vitro and in vivo studies [14–16]. In vitro
studies have suggested that (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, a
highly bioactive catechin, reduces the infectivity of both
influenza A and B viruses in Madin-Darby canine kidney
cells [14, 15]. Influenza A and B are mainly spread sea-
sonally, and are particularly problematic to public health.
Several clinical studies have also investigated the use of
tea and its ingredients to prevent influenza infection
[17–23]. These studies have examined both the effects of
tea consumption and the use of tea as a gargle rinse.
However, only a limited number of studies have focused
on tea consumption [20, 23], and the effect of gargling
with tea or its ingredients has remained inconclusive. In-
deed, although several small-scale studies have demon-
strated efficacy [17, 18], other studies have not shown
any significant effect [19, 21, 22].
Considering the current state of research, we decided
to conduct a meta-analysis of randomized controlled
studies and prospective cohort studies to assess the ef-
fect of gargling with tea and its ingredients on the pre-
vention of influenza infection.
Methods
Design overview
The primary endpoint of this study was influenza infec-
tion that had been confirmed by antigen detection test-
ing and/or antibody titer testing. We searched the
published literature using common electronic databases
(Cochrane Library, PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science,
and Ichu-shi Web), and additionally performed a manual
search using the reference lists of the included studies.
All studies were reviewed by two reviewers independ-
ently (KI and HY). The overall scientific quality of the
randomized controlled studies was assessed using the
Jadad score [24, 25] and the Cochrane Collaboration's
tool for assessing risk for bias [26]. The non-randomized
cohort studies were assessed using the Newcastle-
Ottawa scale [27, 28]. The studies that were ultimately
selected for our meta-analysis were pooled using the
Mantel-Haenszel method [29] and a random effects
model. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot
[30] and Egger’s regression analysis [31]. This study was a
meta-analysis of previously published results and did not
enroll any humans or animals. Accordingly, additional
informed consent and ethical approval were not required.
Search strategy and selection criteria
The
published
literature
was
searched
using
the
Cochrane
Library
(http://www.cochranelibrary.com/),
PubMed/MEDLINE (1966 to September 2015), Web of
Science (1981 to September 2015), and Ichu-shi Web (1983
to September 2015). This search was performed with the
following terms in MEDLINE: (“catechin” [MeSH Terms]
OR “tea” [MeSH Terms]) AND (“influenza, human” [MeSH
Terms] OR “upper respiratory tract inflammation” [All
Fields]) AND gargling [All Fields] AND (clinical trial [pt]
OR “clinical trials as topic” [MeSH Terms: noexp] OR trial
[ti]) AND Clinical Trial [ptyp]. In addition, the reference
lists of the included studies were searched manually.
All studies extracted from the databases were inde-
pendently reviewed by two reviewers (KI and HY). As
noted above, the randomized controlled studies were
assessed using the Jadad score [24, 25] and the Cochrane
Collaboration's tool for assessing risk for bias [26]. The
Jadad score is calculated by assessing randomization
(range, 0–2), double blinding (range, 0–2), and with-
drawals and dropouts (range, 0–1). The total score
ranges from 0 to 5 and is interpreted according to the
following criteria: 0–2 indicates a low-quality report
and 3–5 indicates a high-quality report. The non-
randomized cohort studies were assessed using the
Newcastle-Ottawa scale [27, 28]. This scale is constructed
from 3 grouping items, and stars are awarded for each
item: 1) selection of cohorts (range, 0–4 stars), 2) compar-
ability of cohorts (range, 0–2 stars), and 3) assessment of
outcomes (range, 0–3 stars). The total number of stars
Ide et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:396 
Page 2 of 7
 ranges from 0 to 9, and a high quality study can be
awarded 9 stars.
The meta-analysis included studies that met each of
the following criteria: 1) studies with randomized con-
trolled designs or prospective cohort designs; 2) studies
that investigated gargling with tea or its components for
at least 60 days; 3) studies with a control group, such as
a placebo, water, or non-gargling group; 4) studies in
which influenza infection was confirmed by antigen and/
or antibody detection methods; 5) studies published in
English and/or Japanese. The criterion regarding the
duration of the gargling was chosen based on seasonal
epidemic periods.
Data extraction
The following information was extracted from published
reports: 1) the authors’ names and the year of publica-
tion, 2) the study population, 3) the study design and the
duration of the intervention or observation, and 4) the
number of participants infected by influenza and the
methods of confirmation.
Endpoint
The primary endpoint of this study was influenza infec-
tion that had been confirmed by an antigen detection
test. In addition to rapid antigen tests that are used in
clinical practice, we also included changes in antibody
titer in this endpoint.
Statistical analyses
The studies that were selected for the meta-analysis
were pooled using both the Mantel-Haenszel method
for a fixed effects model and a random effects model
[32, 33]. The random effects model was fitted via re-
stricted maximum-likelihood estimation. The results were
expressed as relative risks (RRs) with 95 % confidence in-
tervals (CIs). Heterogeneity among the studies was assessed
using a Q-test and quantified with the I2 statistic for the
random effects model [34]. For the Q-test, P < 0.1 was con-
sidered representative of statistically significant heterogen-
eity. I2 estimates the total percentage of variability in the
effect size estimates, with I2 > 50 % indicating moderate to
large heterogeneity. The relative qualities of model fits were
assessed using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) [35]
and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) [36]. AIC and
BIC values were compared between the fixed and random
effects models to judge their relative qualities, with smaller
values of AIC and BIC indicating better fits of the model to
the data [35, 36]. Publication bias was assessed using a fun-
nel plot [30] and Egger’s regression analysis [31]. For the
Egger’s regression analysis, P < 0.1 was considered repre-
sentative of statistically significant publication bias. All stat-
istical analyses were performed using R version 3.2.0 for
Windows with the Metafor package [37] (The R Founda-
tion for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Results
Description of the included studies
The flow diagram for the meta-analysis is shown in
Fig. 1. Seventeen studies were identified in the literature
search (8 from the Cochrane Library, 3 from PubMed/
Medline, 2 from Web of Science, and 4 from Ichu-shi
Web). Twelve studies were excluded because they were
duplicated or did not present original data on the effi-
cacy of gargling. The 5 remaining studies were included
in the meta-analysis. Of the included studies, 2 had pro-
spective cohort designs and 3 were randomized con-
trolled trials. The characteristics of the studies, such as
the publishing details (author and year), study popula-
tions, and study designs, are shown in Table 1. The total

 number of participants in each study ranged from 124 to
757, and the range of mean ages was 16 to 83 years. The
durations of the studies ranged from 3 to 5 months. In the
randomized controlled studies, the active groups received
either green tea extract (catechin solution, 1 study) or bot-
tled green tea (2 studies), and the control groups received
either placebo (1 study) or water (2 studies). One cohort
study selected the exposed cohort from the population of
persons with a habit of gargling green tea. The other co-
hort study selected the exposed cohort from the popula-
tion of persons with a habit of gargling black tea. The 2
cohort studies selected the non-exposed cohort from the
same population—persons with or without a habit of garg-
ling water. All of the 5 studies were conducted in Japan.
Regarding the overall scientific quality of the studies, the
2 prospective cohort studies were awarded 7 stars on the
Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and the 3 randomized controlled
studies received Jadad scores of 3 to 5. The results of the
assessments using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale are shown
in Table 2 and, the results of those using the Cochrane
Collaboration's tool for assessing risk for bias and the
Jadad score are shown in Table 3.
Heterogeneity
The Q-test and I2 statistic both suggested low hetero-
geneity among the studies included in this meta-analysis
(I2 = 0.00 %; Q-test: Q = 3.05, P = 0.55).
Efficacy assessment
A forest plot of the RRs for influenza infection is shown
in Fig. 2a, b. The 5 studies included a total of 1890
participants. The participants who gargled with tea or its
ingredients showed a lower risk of influenza infection
than did the participants who gargled with placebo/
water or who did not gargle (fixed effects model: RR =
0.70, 95 % CI = 0.54–0.89; random effects model: RR =
0.71, 95 % CI = 0.56–0.91). The results were consistent
between the fixed effects model (Fig. 2a) and the random
effects model (Fig. 2b). The qualities of the model fits
were as follows: the fixed effects model had an AIC of
6.04 and a BIC of 5.65, while the random effects model
had an AIC of 8.74 and a BIC of 7.52. Accordingly, the
fixed effects model showed a better quality of fit to the
data, as compared with the random effects model.
Potential publication bias
A funnel plot of the included studies is shown in Fig. 3.
Because of the limited number of studies that were in-
cluded in this analysis (n = 5), visual interpretation of the
plot was inconclusive. The result of the Egger’s regres-
sion analysis was not significant (P = 0.30).

 Discussion
The meta-analysis of 5 studies with 1890 participants in-
dicated that gargling with tea and its ingredients reduces
the risk of influenza infection, as compared with the
control activities. The effects of gargling with tea and its
ingredients on the prevention of influenza infection have
been investigated since the 1990s; nonetheless, the
present study is the first meta-analysis to consider this
subject. A combination of non-pharmaceutical interven-
tions and/or an improvement in the effectiveness of
non-pharmaceutical interventions are needed to control
influenza epidemics [13]. Tea and its ingredients may be
useful for this purpose. The mean ages of participants in
the included studies ranged from 16 to 83 years, and this
suggested that gargling with tea and its ingredients
might be effective for any age group or population. All
of the studies included in the analysis used a control
group or non-exposed cohort from the same population,
which ensures the comparability of their results. In
addition, all of the cohort studies and randomized con-
trolled trials were well designed [17–19, 21, 22]. There-
fore, the results of this meta-analysis of well-designed
studies may be reliable. The AIC and BIC values for the
fixed effects model were smaller than those for the ran-
dom effects model, which indicates that the fixed effects
model had a better fit.
Although the meta-analytic results of this study suggest
that gargling with tea and its ingredients has efficacy for
influenza prevention, there are several limitations to our
study. A principal limitation is the small number of stud-
ies that met the inclusion criteria. Further, all 5 of these
studies were conducted in Japan, which could bias or limit
interpretations of the findings. The fact that all of the
studies were conducted in Japan may have helped to avoid
between-study heterogeneity, which is often caused by the
inclusion of different populations with different sociode-
mographic characteristics. Nonetheless, additional studies
of different populations would still be needed to improve
the generalizability of the meta-analytic results. If the
number of studies were increased, a sensitivity analysis
could also be performed. Sensitivity analyses can provide
indications of the robustness of meta-analytic results, in-
cluding insight into factors that affect the efficacy of garg-
ling with tea and its ingredients [38, 39]. A sensitivity
analysis should be carried out in future pooled analyses
with additional high-quality studies. As additional high-
quality studies become available in the future, it may also
be possible to consider more sophisticated methods for
the meta-analysis. We used standard methods for the
meta-analysis in the present study [32, 33]. However, sev-
eral newer approaches are also available, such as individual
participant data meta-analysis [Riley 2010] and Bayesian

 meta-analysis [Sutton 2008]. If future meta-analytic studies
apply both standard and new approaches, then they could
offer more reliable results and greater information about
the robustness of the meta-analytic conclusions. The qual-
ity of the present study could also be improved by expand-
ing the analysis to additional databases, and by collecting
data from other Asian countries. Although we searched 5
major databases for the present study, there are several da-
tabases that were not searched, such as EMBASE.
With respect to publication bias, the result of the
Egger’s regression analysis was not significant and there-
fore did not suggest significant publication bias. None-
theless, visual interpretation of the funnel plot was
inconclusive. The results may have been affected by the
small number of studies that were pooled in the analysis,
and additional studies are needed to obtain more defini-
tive conclusions regarding publication bias. In the future,
additional large-scale randomized controlled studies and
a pooled analysis of these studies could help to improve
the accuracy and robustness of the effect estimate for
gargling with tea and its ingredients.
Conclusions
Gargling with tea or ingredients of tea may be effective
for the prevention of influenza infection. Given the ef-
fectiveness that has been shown in this meta-analysis,
gargling with tea or its ingredients may provide a simple
and useful addition to the non-pharmaceutical interven-
tions that are currently employed for influenza control.
However, additional large-scale randomized controlled
trials of different populations are needed to confirm our
findings.
