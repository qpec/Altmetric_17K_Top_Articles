Abstract  
Background: Approximately 10% of older adults is annually admitted to a hospital. Hospitalisation is 
associated with a higher risk of falls and mortality after discharge. This study aimed to identify 
predictors at admission for falls and mortality three months post-discharge in hospitalised older 
patients. 
Methods: The EMPOWER study is an observational, prospective longitudinal inception cohort of 
378 patients aged 70 years and older who were subsequently admitted to a tertiary hospital (the 
Netherlands). Potential predictors for falls and mortality three months post-discharge were tested 
using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses and included the following domains: 
demographic (age, sex, living independently), lifestyle (alcohol, smoking), nutrition (SNAQ score), 
muscle mass (absolute, relative), physical function (handgrip strength, Katz ADL score), cognition (6-
CIT score) and disease (medications, diseases).  
Results: The mean age was 79.6 years (standard deviation 6.23) and 50% were male. Within three 
months post-discharge, 19% reported a fall and 13% deceased. Univariate predictors for falls were 
higher age, lower absolute muscle mass and higher 6-CIT score. Lower absolute muscle mass 
independently predicted falls post-discharge (multivariate). Univariate predictors for mortality were 
higher age, male sex, no current alcohol use, higher SNAQ score, lower absolute and higher relative 
muscle mass, higher Katz ADL score and higher number of diseases. Male sex, higher SNAQ score 
and lower absolute muscle mass independently predicted mortality post-discharge (multivariate).  
Conclusions: In hospitalised older adults, muscle mass should be measured to predict future outcome. 
Future intervention studies should investigate if increasing muscle mass prevent short term falls and 
mortality.

Introduction 
Hospitalization in older individuals is associated with adverse health outcomes such as 
increased risk of falls and mortality after discharge (1,2). Falls are a serious medical problem 
in older individuals leading to decreased physical function, severe injury and morbidity (3,4). 
Falls rates have been reported to be specifically higher during the first weeks after discharge 
due to recent illness and decline of physical function during hospital stay (5). In the majority 
of cases, mortality is an unwarranted outcome of a disease trajectory after hospitalization and 
affects 35% of older individuals one year after hospital admission (6).  
 
Tools predicting short term falls and mortality post-discharge remain limited and are most 
often tailored to a specific group of patients based on their disease characteristics (6-10). Risk 
factors known to contribute to falls and mortality in hospitalised older patients include poor 
functional status, poor cognition, illness severity, comorbidities and polypharmacy (11-13). 
Additionally, malnutrition and low health-related quality of life has also been attributed to a 
higher mortality rate three months post-discharge (14,15). Muscle mass and muscle strength 
have been shown to strongly predict adverse outcomes in cohorts of older individuals (16-
20), but very limited data is available on its capacity predicting short term outcome post-
discharge in older patients (14). 
 
The aim of this study was to identify predictors at admission for falls and mortality three 
months post-discharge in a cohort of hospitalised patients 70 years and older.

Methods 
Study design 
The Evaluation of Muscle parameters in a Prospective cohort of Older patients at clinical 
Wards Exploring Relations with bed rest and malnutrition (EMPOWER) study is an 
observational, prospective, longitudinal inception cohort study which was conducted from 
April 2015 to December 2015 at the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, The 
Netherlands. In total, 838 patients aged 70 years or older who were admitted to either one of 
four clinical wards (acute admission, internal medicine, neurosurgery and orthopaedics or 
traumatology) were considered eligible and subsequently screened for participation in 
EMPOWER. Patients had to sign informed consent to participate. Patients were excluded if: 
(i) their expected length of stay was less than 24 hours; (ii) they were nursed in isolation 
rooms; (iii) they were terminally ill; (iv) they were not able to understand the Dutch 
language. A total of 378 patients were included in the EMPOWER study (14). Patients were 
assessed within 48 hours after admission (n=378) and three months post-discharge by a 
telephone interview (n=297). The study was approved by the medical ethics committee of the 
VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  
 
Domains characteristics at admission 
Potential predictors for falls and mortality were grouped into seven domains: demographics, 
lifestyle, nutrition, physical function, muscle mass, cognition and disease.

Age and sex were collected from medical records and living situation during a bed side 
interview. Living independently (yes/no) was defined as living at home compared to living 
dependently in nursing homes and rehabilitation centres. 
Lifestyle 
Current alcohol use (yes/no) and current smoking (yes/no) were collected during a bed side 
interview. 
 
Nutrition 
Risk of malnutrition was measured using the Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire 
(SNAQ) with a score ranging from 0-7 points with higher scores indicating greater risk of 
malnutrition (21).  
 
Physical function 
Handgrip strength (HGS) was measured using a Jamar Hydraulic Handheld Dynamometer 
(Sammons Preston, Inc. Bolingbrook, IL, USA). Patients were asked to sit in an upright 
position with shoulders adducted and the elbow unsupported and flexed at 90 degrees. If 
patients were unable to sit, HGS was measured with the bed at an angle of 30 degrees, elbows 
unsupported and flexed at 90 degrees. Patients were asked to squeeze maximally twice for 
each hand, encouraged by the trained assessor. The maximum score of the four trials was 
used for the analyses and expressed in kilograms (22). Activities of daily living (ADL) 
dependency was assessed using the Katz score, ranging from 0-6 points, a higher score 
meaning greater dependency (23).

Muscle mass 
Weight was measured on a weighting chair. If patients were unable to get out of bed, an 
estimate was obtained from the patient or a relative. Height was estimated using knee-height 
and the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam formula (LASA): female: height (cm) = 68.74 
– (0.16 x age) + (2.07 x knee-height in cm), male: height (cm) = 74.48 – (0.15 x age) + (2.03 
x knee-height in cm) (24). Direct segmental multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis 
(DSM-BIA, InBody S10, Biospace Co., Ltd, Seoul) was used to assess muscle mass (25), 
expressed as: (i) skeletal muscle mass (SMM) in kilograms; (ii) skeletal muscle mass as 
percentage of body weight (26); (iii) skeletal muscle index (SMI: SMM divided by height 
squared) in kg/m2 (19); and (iv) appendicular lean mass (ALM) in kilograms. All muscle 
mass variables were analysed as continuous variables. SMM in kilograms, SMI and ALM in 
kilograms were considered absolute muscle mass, SMM as a percentage was considered 
relative muscle mass. DSM-BIA measurements were not performed in case of an implantable 
cardioverter defibrillator or other implanted devices (n=29) or if it was impossible to position 
the electrodes at both middle fingers, thumbs and ankles (n=28).  
 
Cognition 
Cognition was assessed with the Six Item Cognitive Impairment Test (6-CIT), ranging from 
0-28 points, a higher score indicating lower cognitive functioning (27).

Medical records were used to collect data on the number of medications and number of 
diseases. The following diseases contributed to the number: stroke, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, chronic kidney failure, hypertension, myocardial infarction, diabetes 
mellitus, cancer, thyroid disease, Parkinson’s disease, arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, 
osteoporosis and dementia.  
 
Falls and mortality three months post-discharge 
Falls three months post-discharge was assessed by a telephone interview and defined as at 
least one fall within three months post-discharge. All-cause mortality was extracted from the 
hospital data system three months post-discharge and included in-hospital deaths.  
 
Statistical analyses 
Continuous variables with a normal distribution were presented as mean ± standard deviation 
(SD) and a skewed distribution as median and interquartile range (IQR). Categorical and 
binomial variables were presented as numbers (n) and percentage (%). Patient characteristics 
at hospital admission were compared between patients who reported at least one fall three 
months post-discharge with patients who reported no fall, and between patients who were 
deceased three months post-discharge with patients who were alive. Statistical differences 
were analysed using Paired Samples T-Test (continuous variables with normal distribution), 
Mann-Whitney U test (continuous variables with skewed distribution) and Chi-square or 
Fisher’s Exact Test (dichotomous variables).

Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to analyse associations between the 
independent variables (variables within the health domains) at admission and dependent 
variables (falls and mortality) three months post-discharge. Multivariate logistic regression 
analysis was performed using the significant variables (p<0.20) from the univariate logistic 
regression analysis. Due to the multicollinearity within the muscle mass domain, the variable 
with the lowest p-value was chosen for the multivariate analysis. Significance for the 
multivariate logistic regression analysis was set at p<0.05. Results of the logistic regression 
analysis were presented as odds ratios (OR and 95% confidence intervals (CI)). Patients were 
selected to be included for the univariate and multivariate if data was available on all 
potential predictors and falls/mortality three months-post discharge (222 patients for the                                                                   
falls analysis and 291 patients for the mortality analysis). Statistical analyses were performed 
using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, 
Version 24.0 Armonk, NY, IBM Corp).

Results 
Figure 1 shows the flowchart of patient screening, inclusion, follow-up and patients included 
for the present analysis. The falls analysis included 222 patients and the mortality analysis 
291 patients. Table 1 shows the descriptive characteristics of patients at hospital admission. 
The mean age was 79.4 ± 5.99 years and 79.6 ± 6.23 years, and 49.1% and 50.2% of the 
patients were male for the falls and mortality subgroup respectively. Three months post-
discharge, 19.4% reported at least one fall and 12.7% deceased in the period from hospital 
admission to three months post-discharge. Patients that reported at least one fall three months 
post-discharge had significantly higher SNAQ score, lower absolute SMM, lower SMI and 
higher 6-CIT score at admission compared to patients with no fall. Patients who were 
deceased three months post-discharge were significantly more often male, had higher SNAQ 
score, lower SMI and higher number of diseases at admission compared to patients who were 
alive. 
 
Predictors for falls three months post-discharge 
Table 2 shows the univariate and multivariate analysis of the domain characteristics at 
admission with falls three months post-discharge. Univariate predictors (p<0.20) for falls 
were a higher age, lower absolute SMM, SMI and ALM, and higher 6-CIT score. SMI had 
the lowest p-value predicting falls within the muscle mass domain. Lower SMI was the only 
independent significant predictor for falls in the multivariate analysis.

Discussion 
A lower absolute muscle mass, represented by SMI, was found to be an independent predictor 
for falls while male sex, a higher SNAQ score and lower SMI were independent predictors 
for mortality three months post-discharge.  
 
The finding that muscle mass, represented by SMI, was one of the most significant 
independent predictor for falls is in agreement with recent meta-analyses showing an 
association of sarcopenia with falls, fractures and mortality in diverse populations of older 
individuals (28,29). Despite the scarce evidence of muscle mass as predictor of adverse 
outcomes in hospitalized patients, the strong association across different cohort settings 
underlines the potential generalizability of pathophysiological mechanisms. Growing 
evidence highlights the clear relationship between low muscle mass and morbidity, such as 
osteoporosis and frailty, and the association with outcomes after surgical or pharmacological 
interventions (30). This is of upmost importance as muscle measures are sensitive to change 
during hospitalization due to prolonged bedrest (31,32). The appealing trait of skeletal muscle 
is its capacity to be modifiable in volume by nutritional and exercise interventions (33). 
Therefore, lower muscle mass as a risk factor for adverse outcomes is potentially reversible, 
which differentiates muscle mass from most other non-modifiable risk factors, such as age, 
cognition and the majority of chronic diseases. However, it is yet unknown if increasing 
muscle mass will subsequently lead to a reduction in adverse outcomes after hospitalization. 
Furthermore, barriers of effective interventions such as patients’ engagement in physical 
exercise have to be overcome (34,35).

Additional to SMI, multiple other factors of various domains were independently predictive 
for mortality three months post-discharge. Male sex is a risk factor for mortality across all 
age ranges (36). In line with our finding, another observational longitudinal study of 
inpatients also highlighted sex differences (37), most likely due to sex differences in disease 
burden (36).  
 
 
Risk of malnutrition, assessed by the SNAQ, was positively associated with mortality three 
months post-discharge. This finding is concurrent with a study showing that hospitalised 
older patients who were at risk of malnutrition or who were malnourished were more likely to 
die in the hospital compared to those well-nourished (38). Furthermore, a high risk of 
malnutrition has been found to be associated with lower muscle mass and mortality in the 
same EMPOWER cohort (14,39). 
 
Strengths/limitations 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating several characteristics from 
different domains at admission with both falls and mortality three months post-discharge. The 
design being an inception cohort minimised selection bias of the study sample. The data for 
falls three months post-discharge were collected via telephone interviews, which could be 
prone to (recall) bias. Death (n=42) and patients lost of follow up (n=29) may have 
introduced bias of the study sample. Furthermore, body composition measurements may have 
been influenced by the hydration status affecting the ratio of muscle mass/fat mass. As the 
follow-up was performed using a phone call, the data collected post-discharge was limited

Conclusion 
In hospitalised older adults, muscle mass represented by SMI was an important independent 
predictor for both falls and mortality three months post-discharge. Male sex and a higher risk 
of malnutrition were also significant predictors for mortality. Risk factor detection should be 
an essential part of a hospital stay and post-discharge policies should be established to 
prevent falls and mortality post-discharge. Muscle mass, however, is infrequently measured 
in regular clinical care (40) and further research should focus on the feasibility measuring 
muscle mass in routine clinical inpatient settings and interventions improving muscle mass as 
a modifiable risk factor eventually reducing falls and mortality after hospital stay.
