Systemic inflammation increases with
age, but the underlying causes are
debated. Using young and old germ-free

demonstrate that age-related microbiota
changes drive intestinal permeability,
age-associated inflammation, and
decreased macrophage function.
Reducing TNF levels rescues microbiota

SUMMARY
Levels of inflammatory mediators in circulation are
known to increase with age, but the underlying cause
of this age-associated inflammation is debated. We
find that, when maintained under germ-free condi-
tions, mice do not display an age-related increase
in
circulating
pro-inflammatory
cytokine
levels.
A higher proportion of germ-free mice live to
600 days than their conventional counterparts, and
macrophages derived from aged germ-free mice
maintain anti-microbial activity. Co-housing germ-
free mice with old, but not young, conventionally
raised mice increases pro-inflammatory cytokines
in the blood. In tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-deficient
mice, which are protected from age-associated
inflammation, age-related microbiota changes are
not observed. Furthermore, age-associated micro-
biota changes can be reversed by reducing TNF
using anti-TNF therapy. These data suggest that
aging-associated microbiota promote inflammation
and that reversing these age-related microbiota
changes represents a potential strategy for reducing
age-associated inflammation and the accompanying
morbidity.
INTRODUCTION
In 1907, Elie Metchnikoff proposed that tissue destruction and
senescence were consequences of chronic systemic inflamma-
tion, which occurred as a result of increased permeability in the
colon and the escape of bacteria and their products (Metchnik-
off, 1907). He believed that these bacterial products activated
phagocytes and that the resulting inflammatory response
caused deterioration of surrounding tissues. Indeed, aging is
characterized by a state of chronic, low-grade, systemic inflam-
mation (Franceschi et al., 2000). Higher than average levels of
age-associated inflammation are a strong predictor of overall ill
health, development of chronic inflammatory conditions, and
all-cause mortality in the elderly. Although age-associated
inflammation influences the aging process, it is unclear why
levels of cytokines in the tissues and circulation increase with
age. It has been theorized that gradual, cumulative, sub-clinical
tissue damage occurs, which increases the burden of tissue
repair and results in increasing background levels of pro-inflam-
matory cytokine production (Franceschi et al., 2000); however,
the experimental evidence that would definitively prove this
hypothesis is lacking.
In contrast, studies in Drosophila demonstrate that age-
related changes in the microbiota increase intestinal perme-
ability (Clark et al., 2015) and drive inflammation and mor-
tality (Rera et al., 2012). Although it has been demonstrated
that the microbial composition of the gut correlates with
levels of circulating cytokines in the nursing home elderly
(Claesson et al., 2012) and in old mice (Conley et al., 2016),
it is not known whether this association is correlative or
whether the gut microbiota are a driver of age-associated
inflammation. If the latter is true, it would indicate that these
age-related changes in composition are a form of microbial
dysbiosis.
Herein we report that intestinal permeability increases with
age in mice due to age-related microbial dysbiosis. We
demonstrate that microbial products enter the bloodstream
of aged mice where they trigger systemic inflammation
(i.e., elevated levels of serum interleukin 6 [IL6]). Chronic expo-
sure to inflammation alters macrophage function, rendering
these cells poor killers of bacteria but potent producers of
inflammatory cytokines, which ultimately contributes to the
inflammatory state of the aged host. Using old (18–22 months)

 germ-free mice, which do not have age-associated inflam-
mation, we demonstrate that colonization with the micro-
biota from old mice drives the inflammation that accompanies
aging.

RESULTS
TNF Drives Age-Associated Defects
in Macrophage Function
We
found
that,
after
normalizing
for
differences in bacterial uptake between
mice, resident peritoneal (Figure 1A) and
bone marrow-derived (Figure 1B) macro-
phages from old wild-type (WT) mice (18–
22 months) were impaired in their ability
to
kill
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
as
compared to those from young WT mice
(10–14 weeks). Following internalization,
bacterial lysis was observable in macro-
phages from young mice but reduced or
delayed in old mice (Figure 1C). Maturation
markers on macrophages from young and
old mice were expressed at equal levels,
indicating that differences observed with age were not due to
altered differentiation or maturity (Figure S1, related to Figure 1).
Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL6 and tumor
necrosis factor (TNF), in the circulation and tissues increase

 with age, both in humans and mice (Bouchlaka et al., 2013; Fran-
ceschi et al., 2007). In keeping with previous reports, levels of
TNF and IL6 in the circulation (Figures 1D and 1E) and IL6 in
the lungs (Figure 1F) were higher in old mice. Peribronchiolar
cellular infiltration was observed in the lungs of old mice in the
absence of stimulation or overt infection (Figure 1G). Consistent
with what others have shown, whole blood (Figure 1H) from old
mice produced higher baseline levels of IL6 than that from
young mice, and it produced more IL6 when stimulated with
S. pneumoniae or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), demonstrating
significantly enhanced pro-inflammatory responses to live bac-
teria and bacterial products. This phenotype was also observed
using bone marrow-derived macrophages from old mice,
which produced more IL6 following stimulation with LPS or
S. pneumoniae compared to young mice (Figure 1I).
It has been frequently observed that individuals with higher
levels of age-associated inflammation are at increased risk of
both developing and dying from S. pneumoniae infection (An-
tunes et al., 2002; Yende et al., 2005). Furthermore, infusion

test where appropriate (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.005, and

of TNF into mice impairs anti-pneumo-
coccal immunity and increases levels of
S. pneumoniae in experimental models
(Hinojosa et al., 2009). We therefore hy-
pothesized that the chronically elevated
levels of TNF that occur with age could
have a direct effect on macrophage-medi-
ated killing of S. pneumoniae. The exogenous addition of TNF
(10 ng/mL) to culture media reduced bacterial killing by macro-
phages from young or old mice (Figure 2A), indicating that the
decreased ability of old macrophages to kill S. pneumoniae
could be due to higher levels of TNF.
Since acute exposure to TNF impaired macrophage killing of
S. pneumoniae, we postulated that chronic age-associated
inflammation, characterized by high systemic levels of TNF,
might underpin the reduction in macrophage anti-bacterial activ-
ity. In contrast to WT animals, aged TNF knockout (KO) mice did
not have greater levels of IL6 in the circulation in the steady state
(Figure 2B), and when LPS was added to whole blood, old TNF
KO mice did not produce higher amounts of IL6 than the stimu-
lated blood of young mice (Figure 2C). Constitutive IL6 produc-
tion was not affected by age in TNF KO lung slices (Figure 2D),
and pulmonary cellular infiltrates were not observed in old
mice, demonstrating protection from inflammation in the lungs
(Figure 2E) Finally, bone marrow-derived macrophages from
old TNF KO mice did not have impaired pneumococcal killing

 in contrast to old WT mice (Figure 2F). Thus, age-associated
inflammation and, more specifically, chronic exposure to TNF
contribute to changes in macrophage function, resulting in
decreased S. pneumoniae killing capacity.
Intestinal Permeability and Levels of Circulating
Bacterial Products Increase with Age
Although our data demonstrated that the presence of TNF
promoted systemic inflammation and impaired macrophage
function, the cause of increased TNF production with age was
unclear. Based on Metchnikoff’s hypothesis that bacterial
components from the gut microbiota could cause systemic
inflammation, we investigated whether increased intestinal
permeability and translocation of bacterial products occurred
in aged mice.
Intestinal permeability was measured in WT mice (3, 12,
15, and 18 months old), by performing oral gavages with
3–5 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran and
measuring translocation of fluorescence into the plasma. Intesti-
nal permeability increased with age (Figure 3A). We next as-
sessed whether this was due to altered paracellular and/or pas-
sive permeability in the ileum and colon of young and old WT
mice. Although there were no gross differences in intestinal ar-
chitecture (Figure 3B), paracellular permeability was higher in
the colons of old mice (Figure 3C), as determined by mucosal-
to-serosal flux using 51chromium-EDTA (51Cr-EDTA). Consistent
with evidence of increased permeability in the colon, where bac-
terial numbers are highest, levels of the bacterial cell wall
component muramyl dipeptide (MDP) were also significantly
higher in the plasma of old WT mice compared to young mice
(Figure 3D). Thus, increased leakiness of the gut is a conse-
quence of aging.

 Germ-free Mice Are Protected from Age-Associated
Inflammation and Dysregulated Macrophage Function
If the increase in circulating microbial products is a driving force
in age-associated inflammation and mortality, we reasoned that
germ-free (GF) mice, which have no detectable MDP in the circu-
lation nor increased intestinal permeability with age (Figure 3E),
would be protected. The proportion of GF mice that lived to
600 days was higher than the specific pathogen free (SPF)
mice (Figure 3F). These GF mice were protected from age-asso-
ciated inflammation, lacking the high circulating IL6 levels found
in old control animals (Figure 3G). They also did not have peri-
bronchiolar cellular infiltrates (Figure 3H) or increased levels of
IL6 in the lungs (Figure 3I) compared to young GF mice. Further-
more, baseline and LPS-induced IL6 in whole blood did not in-
crease with age in GF mice, in contrast to the significantly higher
levels in old SPF/WT mice (Figure 3J). Finally, bone marrow-
derived macrophages from old GF mice did not have impaired
S. pneumoniae killing capacity (Figure 3K) or produce more IL6
than young GF mice either basally or after stimulation with LPS
ex vivo (Figure 3L). These data demonstrate that chronic age-
associated inflammation requires the presence of microbiota.
The Composition of the Microbial Community Influences
Intestinal Permeability and Age-Associated
Inflammation
We envisioned two possibilities that could explain how the mi-
crobiota drive age-associated inflammation. In the first, the pres-
ence of any microbiota, even minimal microbiota, could result in
increased intestinal permeability. The second hypothesis was
that microbial dysbiosis occurs with age to drive increased intes-
tinal permeability.
To test these hypotheses, mice with a minimal microbiome
were used. Mice were colonized with the altered Schaedler flora
(ASF) (Dewhirst et al., 1999) on the C57BL/6 background and
bred for two generations, during which time their microbiota
diversified naturally as previously described (Slack et al.,
2009). The result is a low-diversity microbial community. Similar
to old SPF WT mice, old ASF-derived mice had greater intestinal
permeability (Figure 4A), higher levels of plasma IL6 (Figure 4B),
and higher IL6 production in whole blood following PBS or LPS
stimulation (Figure 4C) than did young mice. Despite having min-
imal microbiota these mice also experienced age-related micro-
bial dysbiosis (Figure 4D).
Although our data demonstrated that colonization with micro-
biota of initially limited diversity was sufficient to elicit age-asso-
ciated changes in permeability and inflammation, we next inves-
tigated whether the microbial composition changes with age to
determine if microbial dysbiosis might contribute to these phe-
notypes. Similar to what others have reported, we found that
there were changes in both community structure (Figure 4E)
and specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the SPF
mice between young and old mice (Table 1). To determine
whether this dysbiosis could increase age-associated inflamma-
tion, young and old GF mice were colonized, via co-housing, with
microbiota from either young or old SPF mice. The microbial dys-
biosis that was evident in the fecal microbiota of the donor mice
was maintained in the colonized recipient mice over the time
course of this study (Figure 4E). After a minimum of 6 weeks,
changes in paracellular permeability were assessed in the colo-
nized mice. The paracellular permeability was measured from all
the GF mice colonized with the microbiota sourced from old mice
(n = 23 total, n = 11 young mice and n = 12 old mice) compared to
young microbiota (n = 13, n = 6 young mice and n = 7 old mice).
Microbiota sourced from old mice significantly increased
paracellular permeability (Figure 4F). The age of the host did,
however, influence the development of paracellular permeability.
Young mice colonized with the microbiota from old mice had
higher paracellular permeability, demonstrating that the compo-
sition of the microbiota can increase permeability. Although old
mice colonized with the old microbiota had the greatest degree
of permeability, old mice colonized with the young microbiota
also had an increase in permeability, implying that there
are age-related changes in the gut that predispose to barrier
dysfunction (Figure 4G).
In addition to the paracellular permeability, the age of the host
contributed to levels of circulating TNF (Figure 4H). Circulating
TNF was measured from all the young GF mice (n = 13 total,
n = 5 colonized with young microbiota and n = 8 colonized
with old microbiota) and old GF mice (n = 11 total, n = 5 colonized
with the young microbiota and n = 6 colonized with the old micro-
biota). Old recipients had higher levels of circulating TNF than
young recipients (Figure 4H). Young GF mice that were colonized
with old SPF microbiota had higher levels of plasma TNF than
those recolonized with young SPF microbiota (Figure 4H), indi-
cating that the specific composition of the aging microbial com-
munity contributes to age-associated inflammation but there are
age-related changes that predispose old mice to increased
inflammation when they are exposed to any microbiota (Fig-
ure 4I). These data indicate that the composition of the aged mi-
crobiota altered intestinal permeability but that the composition
of the microbiota interacts with other age-related changes in the
host to enhance systemic inflammation.
A Reciprocal Relationship between Age-Associated
Inflammation and Microbial Dysbiosis
Our data demonstrate that the gut microbiota and/or age-related
microbial dysbiosis can lead to increased gut permeability with
age and result in age-associated inflammation. However, since
expression of TNF has been shown to increase intestinal perme-
ability in vitro (So
¨ derholm et al., 2004) and anti-TNF treatment
can alter intestinal permeability in vivo (Noth et al., 2012), we
also considered the possibility that age-associated increases
in TNF could exacerbate intestinal permeability and subsequent
release of bacterial products. We hypothesized that, if age-asso-
ciated increases in TNF promoted increased intestinal perme-
ability, old TNF KO mice would be protected and would not
have higher levels of circulating bacterial components than
young TNF KO mice. Consistent with this, intestinal barrier func-
tion in old TNF KO mice was equivalent to young TNF KO mice,
young SPF WT mice, and young or old GF mice (Figure 5A), and
circulating levels of MDP in these mice did not increase with age
(Figure 5B).
Although TNF is proposed to alter permeability of epithelial
barriers, the mechanism remains unclear. We hypothesized
that TNF may be a driver of microbial dysbiosis and that this
might be an indirect way in which barrier function is decreased.
If this hypothesis is correct then age-related microbial dysbiosis
would be less pronounced in old TNF KO mice. To determine

(A and B) Mice with minimal ASF-derived microbiota
were aged, and their intestinal permeability was
measured via FITC-dextran oral gavage assay (A;
n = 5). Old (18 months) ASF mice had higher intestinal
permeability than young (10–14 weeks) ASF mice in
addition to higher levels of plasma IL6 (B).
(C) IL6 production after LPS stimulation in whole blood
was higher in old ASF mice (n = 3).

ASF mice indicates that age-related microbial dys-
biosis occurs.
(E) Taxa summaries illustrate that the composition of
the young and old microbiota is retained upon transfer
to young or old GF mice (n = 5–16 mice/group over four
independent colonization experiments).
(F) Paracellular permeability was measured in GF mice
colonized with young and old microbiota (n = 6–8 mice
per group). There was a statistically significant in-
crease in paracellular permeability in mice colonized
with old microbiota (n = 23 total, n = 11 young mice and
n = 12 old mice) compared to young microbiota (n = 13,
n = 6 young mice and n = 7 old mice). This demon-
strates that the age of the microbiota alters barrier
function.
(G) Colonization of young GF mice with old microbiota
increased

compared
to
those colonized with young microbiota; however, old
mice colonized with either young or old microbiota
demonstrated increased permeability, indicating that
age-related changes in the host increased suscepti-
bility to the microbiota.
(H) Circulating TNF was measured from all the young
GF mice (n = 13 total, n = 5 colonized with young mi-
crobiota and n = 8 colonized with old microbiota) and
old GF mice (n = 11 total, n = 5 colonized with the
young microbiota and n = 6 colonized with the old
microbiota). Old recipient mice had higher levels of
circulating TNF than young recipient mice.
(I) The microbiota contributed to the increased TNF in
the circulation of young mice, since young GF mice
colonized with old microbiota had higher circulating
levels of TNF than those colonized with young micro-
biota. In contrast, colonization with either the young or
old microbiota increased circulating TNF in old GF
mice, indicating that the age of the host interacts with
the age of the microbiota to induce systemic inflam-
mation. Bars represent the mean ± SEM. Statistical
significance was determined using the Mann-Whitney
test or two-way ANOVA with Fisher’s post-test or un-
paired t test where appropriate (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.005,
and ***p < 0.0005).

 whether the fecal microbiota of TNF KO mice were less divergent
with age than the WT microbiota, the distances between young-
old pairs were calculated using the Bray-Curtis distance matrix.
Average distances between the young and old WT mice were
greater than the young and old TNF KO mice, indicating that
the beta diversity was greater between young and old WT mice
(p = 0.04, Mann-Whitney test). The divergence in the microbiota
that occurs in aging WT mice and the decreased divergence that
occurs in aging TNF KO mice is visualized in Figure 5C and listed
in Table 1.
To further evaluate the potential of TNF to induce changes to
the intestinal microbiota, young and old WT mice were treated
with the anti-TNF drug Humira for 2 weeks, which reduced
TNF levels in old mice to below the limit of detection. Anti-TNF,
but not an IgG control, altered the composition of the intestinal
microbiota of old mice (Figure 5D), as there was a significant
(p = 0.045) interaction on the Bray-Curtis distances of the old
Humira and IgG microbiota, but not the young Humira- and
IgG-treated microbiota. This demonstrates that the microbiota
can be manipulated by altering the inflammatory status of the
host. Changes in specific OTUs during anti-TNF treatment are
described in Table 2. Despite altering the microbiota, anti-TNF
treatment had no measurable effect on intestinal permeability,
as measured by translocation of FITC-dextran (data not shown),
indicating that these changes to the composition of the intestinal
microbiota were not a consequence of altered TNF levels having
any direct effect on intestinal permeability. These experiments
do not rule out a role for age-associated increases in TNF driving
intestinal permeability by directly altering intestinal barrier
function, but they do indicate that elevated levels of TNF
contribute to age-associated microbial dysbiosis. Collectively
these data are most consistent with dysbiosis causing increased
intestinal permeability and translocation of bacterial products,
which increases systemic inflammation that ultimately impairs
macrophage function, a model for which is presented in
Figure 5E.
DISCUSSION
Age-associated inflammation is a strong risk factor for overall
mortality in older adults. In fact, individuals having higher than
age-average levels of inflammatory markers are more likely to
be hospitalized (de Gonzalo-Calvo et al., 2012a), have higher
all-cause mortality rates (Giovannini et al., 2011), be frail (Leng
et al., 2007), be less independent (de Gonzalo-Calvo et al.,
2012b), and are more likely to have a variety of late-life diseases
(Bruunsgaard, 2006; Bruunsgaard et al., 1999) Age-associated
inflammation has also been shown to increase susceptibility to
pneumococcal infection (Yende et al., 2005, 2013), and it is asso-
ciated with increased disease severity and decreased survival
from pneumococcal infection in older adults (Antunes et al.,
2002; Reade et al., 2009). Despite the clinical importance of
age-associated inflammation, the etiological factors that lead
to its development have not been identified. This study demon-
strates that age-associated inflammation and microbial dysbio-
sis drive intestinal permeability and translocation of bacterial

 components, further fueling inflammation and impairing cellular
antibacterial function.
In humans, transient endotoxemia occurs naturally after inges-
tion of high-fat meals, vigorous exercise, and in many diseases
(Kelly et al., 2012). Microbial translocation has been shown to
occur in HIV patients due to a loss of immune control at the
gut mucosa, and this translocation leads to a state of immune
activation and systemic inflammation that is reminiscent of
what is observed in normal aging (Brenchley et al., 2006). This in-
crease in chronic inflammation correlates with early mortality,
which is often due to premature development of diseases of
age such as cardiovascular disease (Sandler et al., 2011). In sim-
ian models of HIV, translocation of bacterial products is a precur-
sor of immune activation and macrophage dysfunction (Estes
et al., 2010). In these models, reducing levels of circulating
LPS by chelation with the drug sevelamer prevents immune
dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and, most relevant to our
study, reduces intestinal permeability, implying that bacterial

Figure 5. Microbial Dysbiosis Occurs with
Age and Inflammation
(A) Intestinal permeability, as measured by plasma
FITC-dextran following oral gavage, was increased
in old WT/SPF mice, but not old TNF KO or old GF
mice.
(B) Circulating MDP is increased in old SPF/WT
mice. Old TNF KO and GF mice are not signifi-
cantly different from young WT/SPF mice (n = 5–
10). GF mice do not have any detectable MDP in
the circulation.
(C) Principal coordinate analysis based on Bray-
Curtis demonstrates that the microbial commu-
nities of old WT mice diverge from young mice, but
this is not the case in old TNF KO mice. Mice were
sampled from multiple cages. Chi-square of the
likelihood ratio test in DESeq2 shows old and young
microbiota are significantly different (p < 0.001).
(D) Anti-TNF (Adalimumab) or a human IgG isotype
control was administered at a dose of 50 ng/g of
body weight every other day for 2 weeks. Principal
co-ordinate analysis was used to visualize differ-
ences in the microbial communities after 2 weeks
of anti-TNF treatment. Anti-TNF treatment altered
the composition of the fecal microbiota of old, but
not young, mice.
(E) Basal translocation of microbial products oc-
curs throughout life; however, with age, these
induce an inflammatory response, which contrib-
utes to microbial dysbiosis. Microbial dysbiosis
increases intestinal permeability, which increases
bacterial translocation. This feed-forward process
increases with age.
translocation and subsequent inflamma-
tion are a driver of intestinal permeability,
rather than a readout of intestinal damage
(Kristoff et al., 2014). These data are
consistent with our model in which both
GF and TNF KO mice (which do not have
increased levels of circulating bacterial
products) are protected from age-associ-
ated inflammation. Unlike the GF mice,
which are protected by virtue of not being exposed to bacteria,
the TNF mice may be protected because they do not undergo
microbial dysbiosis with age, which we demonstrate confers in-
testinal permeability and systemic inflammation in the context of
the aged host. This may be an evolutionarily conserved compo-
nent of the aging process, since intestinal permeability has been
demonstrated to precede systemic inflammation and to be a
marker of premature death in Drosophila (Rera et al., 2012).
Metchnikoff made careful observations that, in acute inflam-
mation, macrophage-mediated phagocytosis seemed to be
impaired. In examining autopsy samples of the elderly, he
noticed that brain tissue macrophages seemed to be associated
with areas of damage, and he hypothesized that their presence
might do more harm than good. He also observed that the integ-
rity of the gut changed with age and concluded that, ‘‘it is indu-
bitable, therefore, that the intestinal microbes or their poisons
may reach the system generally and bring harm to it’’ (Metchnik-
off, 1907). He believed that this macrophage ‘‘intoxification’’ had
462

 systemic effects and led to deterioration of even distal tissues.
Our observations are consistent with his, as we observed an in-
crease in circulating bacterial products as our WT mice aged and
evidence of systemic and distal inflammation. Although we only
measured the presence of bacterial products in the serum, it is
entirely possible that they also enter the lymphatics. It has
recently been demonstrated that acute infections can perma-
nently remodel the lymphatics, causing them to become more
permeable (Fonseca et al., 2015). Whether age-related microbial
dysbiosis increases lymphatic permeability is unknown. Regard-
less of how bacterial products enter the periphery, the systemic
inflammation they cause has profound effects on myelopoiesis,
since macrophages derived from bone marrow precursors in
the absence of the aging microenvironment become hyper-in-
flammatory and have poor killing capacity. Although Metchnikoff
imagined that loss of macrophage function was a result of age-
associated inflammation, he did not predict that they may also
contribute to the global inflammatory state. In fact, it appears
as though both aged monocytes (Puchta et al., 2016) and mac-
rophages (Mirsoian et al., 2014) contribute to chronic inflamma-
tion, as their depletion reduces levels of inflammatory cytokines.
Consistent with our findings that the gut microbiota can also
influence systemic (i.e., lung) inflammation and tissue damage,
it has been shown that increased circulating bacterial toxins
result in reduced tight junction gene expression and lethal pul-
monary damage following fecal transplantation (Ji et al., 2014).
The authors suggest that these changes may occur following
overgrowth of gut microbes and/or threshold production of
bacterial products, resulting in their systemic translocation,
increased inflammation, and ensuing pulmonary endothelial
damage. The bacterial taxa that were mainly implicated in this
pathogenicity were members of Clostridia, which others have
also demonstrated have distinct abundance patterns in the ag-
ing gut microbial community (Claesson et al., 2011, 2012).
Although it has been suggested that changes in the microbiota
might drive the ills of aging, determining cause and effect has
been challenging. Numerous studies have demonstrated that
there are characteristic changes in gut microbial communities
in elderly humans (Claesson et al., 2011; M€
akivuokko et al.,
2010; Mariat et al., 2009; Zwielehner et al., 2009) and that these
changes correlate with health status in the elderly population
(Bartosch et al., 2004; Claesson et al., 2012). Furthermore, ther-
apeutic manipulation of the gut microbiota appears to improve
immune function in the elderly. For example, oral supplementa-
tion with Bifidobacterium increased lymphocyte proportions in
the circulation, improved the anti-tumoricidal activity of natural
killer cells, and restored phagocytosis in peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells and neutrophils (Gill et al., 2001a, 2001b). Interest-
ingly, these benefits were most strongly evident in individuals 70
years of age and older, as well as those individuals who demon-
strated the greatest degree of cellular immunosenescence.
Furthermore, dysbiosis in HIV patients, which shows many

 parallels to that which occurs in the elderly (including decreased
Bifidobacteria frequency and increased clusters of Clostridium),
decreases following prebiotic administration. This led to a
decrease in the overall degree of microbial translocation and
ultimately improved immune cell function (Gori et al., 2011).
The microbial communities of the elderly gut appear to be
strongly influenced by diet (Claesson et al., 2012), and dietary in-
terventions designed to restore a robust microbiota may improve
anti-bacterial immunity by reducing age-associated inflamma-
tion and macrophage immunosenescence (Clements and Card-
ing, 2016; Vaiserman et al., 2017).
Although manipulation of the microbiota may improve health
in the elderly, until now it has not been clear whether microbial
dysbiosis is a driver of immune dysfunction. For example, it has
been demonstrated that gut microbial composition correlates
with levels of circulating cytokines and markers of health in
the elderly (Claesson et al., 2012) and that intestinal perme-
ability and systemic inflammation increase in old mice (Scott
et al., 2017), but not whether the microbiota drive these
changes. Our data demonstrate that microbial dysbiosis occurs
with age, even in minimal microbiota, and these changes are
sufficient to promote age-associated inflammation, although
we have not determined whether this is due to enrichment of
specific species, changes in microbe-microbe interactions,
alterations in the functional capacity of the aging microbiota
(e.g., changes in short-chain fatty acid production), or loss of
compartmentalization

as

Drosophila (Li et al., 2016). Interestingly there may be a causal
relationship between age-associated inflammation and microbi-
al dysbiosis, since we found that TNF KO mice had a less diver-
gent microbiota with age and treatment with anti-TNF altered
the microbial communities of aged mice. Although there were
significant changes in the composition of the microbiota with
anti-TNF treatment, we have not yet identified which members
of the microbial community alter barrier function with age.
Further experiments will need to be performed to determine if
it is the loss of beneficial members of the microbial community,
overgrowth of harmful members, or a shift in metabolism that
contributes to this phenomenon.
Metchnikoff had great faith that the appropriate experiments
could be performed to demonstrate that manipulation of the
intestinal microbiota would extend life. Until that time he sug-
gested, ‘‘. those who wish to preserve their intelligence as
long as possible and to make their cycle of life as complete
and as normal as possible under present conditions, must
depend on general sobriety and on habits conforming to the
rules of rational hygiene.’’ The experiments he envisioned remain
to be performed, and, until they are, the only reliable ways to
reduce age-associated inflammation, delay the onset of inflam-
matory diseases, and prolong life are a sensible diet (Fontana
and Hu, 2014; Fontana and Klein, 2007) and exercise (Lee
et al., 1995). For those of us less inclined to live a lifestyle of gen-
eral sobriety, targeting age-associated inflammation may pro-
vide an attractive alternative.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Ethics statement
All experiments were performed in accordance with Institutional Animal Utilization protocols approved by McMaster University’s
Animal Research Ethics Board as per the recommendations of the Canadian Council for Animal Care.
Mouse Experiments
WT young (10-16 wk) and old (18-22 mo) C57BL/6 and TNF–/– mice (originally from Jackson Laboratories), were bred in house. To
protect from age-related obesity, aging SPF mice (and corresponding young controls) are fed with a low protein diet Teklad Irradiated
Global 14% protein Maintenance Diet and provided with an exercise wheel. The average weight of a young SPF mouse (8-14 wks) in
this study is 20 g+/–1g and the old SPF mice (18-22 mo) are on average, 27 g+/–2.5g. Mice were housed in pathogen-free conditions
and pathogen-free status of mice within the aging colony was confirmed in mice through constitutive monitoring of sentinel mice and
specific testing of fecal samples for common mouse pathogens. Mice were maintained in the same animal room, with the exception
of germ-free and ASF mice (all C57BL/6), which were bred in the Gnotobiotic Facility of McMaster. Because the WT and TNF–/– mice
were originally from different breeding colonies from Jackson labs, and the ASF mice had fundamentally different microbiota,
changes in the microbiota were made within strains (i.e., differences between young and old WT or young and old TNF–/– or young
and old ASF mice) but not between strains. For experiments described in Figures 1, 2, 3, and 5 female mice were used. For exper-
iments described in Figure 4 groups of sex matched male and female mice were used. For studies of the microbiota, in order to mini-
mize cage effects or familial transfer of the microbiota (as described in (Ubeda et al., 2012)), mice were selected from multiple cages
and multiple breeding pairs. No evidence of cage effects was found in any of the studies of the microbiota. Due to the limited avail-
ability of aged ASF mice, experiments were performed in groups of 2-4 mice from multiple breeders over 2 years, again minimizing
cage effects.
METHOD DETAILS
TNF ablation
Adalimumab (HUMIRA, Abbott Laboratories), a humanized anti-TNF antibody, or the human IgG isotype control diluted in sterile sa-
line were administered to mice. A dose of 40 mg per gram of body weight was given intraperitoneally in a volume of 200 ml every other
day, for a period of 3 weeks to young and old WT mice.
Histological analysis
Histopathological analysis was carried out on samples from the lungs of old WT, TNF KO and germ-free mice, and their young con-
trols. Upon collection, lungs were formalin-inflated and these, alongside formalin fixed spleens, were paraffin-embedded. Tissue
blocks were cut into 5-mm sections that were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE). The slides were blinded/coded and the colon
epithelial architecture and inflammation were histologically scored. Histological scoring was performed using the following system:
tissue architectural changes: 0, normal; 1, blebbing; 2, loss of epithelium; 3, complete loss of crypt architecture; and inflammation: 0,
normal; 1, increased number of inflammatory cells in lamina propria; 2, increased number of inflammatory cells in submucosa; 3,
dense inflammatory cell mass, but not transmural in nature; 4, transmural inflammation. The average score for all mice was 0 for
both inflammation and epithelial cell architectural changes. Cellular infiltration in the lungs was quantitated in H&E stained sections.
The degree of inflammation within each lung was measured by expressing the total area of the cellular infiltrate within the lung as a

 percentage of the total lung area using ImageJ. Images were acquired with a Leica DM LB2 microscope at a magnification of 20X and
captured using a Leica DFC 280 camera.
Measurement of cytokine production
For circulating levels of cytokines, blood samples from naive animals were collected by retro-orbital bleeding into heparin, and spun
at 1500 x g for 5 min. 100 mL of plasma was then collected, and IL6 levels assayed using ELISA as per the manufacturer’s direction
(eBioscience). To measure the TNF and IL6 cytokine concentrations within the plasma samples of the colonized germ-free mice, Milli-
plex immunoassay Kits were used and completed as recommended by the manufacturer’s instructions (Millipore, Etobicoke, ON).
For whole blood stimulation studies, 100 mL of whole blood samples collected in heparin from young and old WT, TNF KO and
germ-free mice were stimulated with 100 ng/ml of LPS (Eschericia coli 055:B5, ultrapure Invivogen), or left unstimulated. Samples
were incubated for 24 hr at 5% CO2 and 37�C, then centrifuged at 1500 x g for 5 min. 50 mL of plasma samples were assayed for
the presence of IL6 using ELISA. To measure constitutive levels IL6 in the lung, right lobe samples of lung were mechanically homog-
enized in 500 mL of PBS and assayed by ELISA. To measure inducible cytokine production in lung tissue, lungs were perfused with
low melt agarose and sliced into 10 micron sections. 3 slices were cultured in 1 mL of media for 24 hr; supernatants were then
removed and assayed for IL6 production using 100 mL of sample ELISA. To measure cytokine production by bone marrow macro-
phages, 3.5 3 105 mature bone-marrow-derived macrophages were seeded in a 24-well tissue culture-grade plate (Fisher) in 1.5 mL
of media and allowed 24 hr to recover. Cells were then stimulated with either 100 ng/ml of LPS (Eschericia coli 055:B5, ultrapure In-
vivogen), whole heat-killed P1547 at an MOI of 50 or 50 mL of media control. Supernatants were collected at 24 hr post-stimulation.
Levels of TNF or IL6 were measured by ELISA.
Macrophage culture
Bone marrow derived-macrophages were isolated according to previously published methods(60) and differentiated in the presence
of L929 conditioned media for 8 days as per standard protocols. After 8 days the cells were incubated with 4 mg/ml lidocaine (Sigma)
for 15 min at 4�C and gently lifted using a cell lifter. Cells were then centrifuged, counted and re-suspended in medium at a concen-
tration appropriate for measurement of cytokine production, bacterial uptake, flow cytometry or bacterial killing assays. Macrophage
maturation was assessed by flow cytometry using APC-conjugated anti-F4/80, PE-conjugated anti-Ly6G or -CCR2, FITC-conju-
gated Ly6C, eFluor 450-conjugated CD45 and PE-Cy7-conjugated CD11b, or corresponding isotype controls. Pattern recognition
receptor (PRR) expression was measured using anti-TLR4-FITC, anti-TLR2-PE-Cy7 and anti-CD14-PerCpCy5.5 (eBioscience), as
well as anti-MARCO-PE (RND systems). To visualize S. pneumoniae uptake by macrophages, TRITC labeled bacteria were incubated
with bone marrow derived macrophages for 2h at an MOI of 200. Cells were fixed and stained using an anti-beta actin antibody (Cell
Signaling). Images were acquired at 40X magnification using an inverted Zeiss LSM510 laser confocal microscope.
Bacterial killing assays
To measure macrophage killing of S. pneumoniae, 5 3 105 bone marrow derived macrophages were pre-incubated with an multi-
plicity of infection (MOI) of 10 bacteria per macrophage for 60 min at 37�C with gentle inversion as outlined above to allow for inter-
nalization of bacteria (Novakowski et al., 2017). Viable CFUs were determined by culturing of supernatants on TS agar plates.
In vitro and in vivo permeability
Sections of colon and ileum were excised, opened along the mesenteric border, and mounted in Ussing chambers (World Precision
Instruments, Sarasota, Florida). Tissues (ileum and colon) were allowed to equilibrate for 15-25 min before baseline values for poten-
tial difference (PD) and short circuit current (Isc) were recorded. Tissue conductance (G) was calculated by Ohm’s law using the PD
and Isc values. Mucosal to serosal flux of the small inert probe (360 Da) 51-chromium-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (51Cr-EDTA)
was used to assess paracellular permeability. After equilibration, time zero samples were taken from the serosal buffer and 6mCi/ml
51CR-EDTA was added to the mucosal compartment. A ‘‘hot sample’’ was taken from the mucosal buffer then samples were then
taken every 30 min from the serosal buffer for 2 hr and counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman). Counts from each
30 min were averaged and compared to the ‘‘hot sample’’(100%). Data expressed as mucosal-to-serosal flux (%flux/cm2/hr).
Each sample was completed in duplicates. Recordings were performed as described previously (Slack et al., 2009; Verdu
et al., 2008).
For non-terminal studies, tracer FITC-labeled dextran (4kDa; Sigma-Aldrich) was used to assess in vivo intestinal permeability.
Mice were deprived of food 4 hr prior to and both food and water 4 hr following an oral gavage using 200 ml of 80 mg/ml FITC-dextran.
Blood was retro-orbitally collected after 4 hr, and fluorescence intensity was measured on fluorescence plates using an excitation
wavelength of 493nm and an emission wavelength of 518 nm.
MDP Detection Bioassay
HEK293T cells stably were transfected with mNod2 (a kind gift from Dr. Jonathan Schertzer) and pNifty2-SEAP plasmids (Invivogen)
to create a reporter system. Binding of the intracellular mNod2 receptor with its ligand, MDP, results in downstream activation and
translocation of NFkB. Activation of this transcription factor leads to SEAP expression via the ELAM proximal promoter, which is de-
tected via absorbance spectroscopy. Plates were seeded with cells 24 hr prior to addition of heat-inactivated mouse plasma, diluted

 1 in 200 in HEK Blue Detection Media (Invivogen) to a final volume of 200 ml, in a 96-well plate format. Readings were performed at
630nm, 24 hr subsequent to stimulation as described in (Verschoor et al., 2015).
Germ-free Mouse Recolonization
For recolonization studies, one young and old germ-free mice were transferred to individually ventilated racks and co-housed with
either a young or old mouse. Due to the availability of aged germ free mice, 8 independent colonization experiments of 2-6 young or
old germ-free mice were performed over 3.5 years. Consequently the SPF mice that were used were from different breeding pairs,
ensuring that cage effects or changes specific to a particular breeding pair were minimized. The mice were left undisturbed for two
week following the start of the colonization and then maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks at which point fecal pellets were collected
for microbiome analysis (as described below), plasma cytokines were assayed and intestinal permeability was measured as
described above.
Bacterial profiling by deep sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA with Illumina
Fecal pellets were collected and the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR as in Bartram et al. (2011); Stearns et al.
(2015); and Whelan et al. (2014). Briefly, each 50 mL PCR reaction mixture contained 1.5 mM of MgCl2 (50mM), 200 mM dNTPs, 4 mM
of BSA, 25 pmol of each primer, 1U of Taq polymerase (Life Technologies), and 200 ng of DNA. The reaction was then run for 30 cycles
(94�C for 2 min, 94�C for 30 s, 50�C for 30�C, 72�C for 30 s), with a final polymerization step at 72�C for 10 min (Eppendorf). The prod-
ucts were separated by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel and visualized under a UV transilluminator and the products correspond-
ing to the amplified V3 region (�300 base pairs) were excised and purified using standard gel extraction kits (QIAGEN). Illumina
sequencing and initial quality control were carried out by the MOBIX-McMaster Genome Center (McMaster University). Custom,
in-house Perl scripts were developed to process the sequences after Illumina sequencing (Whelan et al., 2014). Briefly, Cutadapt
was used to trim the forward and reverse paired-end reads at the opposing primers for input into PANDAseq for assembly (Martin,
2011; Masella et al., 2012). Mismatches and ambiguous base attributions in the assembly from specific set of paired end sequences
were discarded. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were picked using AbundantOTU+ and taxonomy-assigned using the Ribo-
somal Database Project (RDP) classifier against the Greengenes reference database (Ye, 2011). OTU number are generated in order
from most abundant (OTU 1) when clustering using AbundantOTU +. Single sequence OTUs (singletons) were removed prior to all
analyses using Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) (Caporaso et al., 2010).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Unless otherwise mentioned in the figure legend, statistical significance was determined by two-way analysis of variance with
Fischer’s post-test and unpaired t tests (two tailed). Statistical significance was defined as a p value of 0.05. All data were analyzed
with Prism (Version 6; GraphPad). Differences in the survival curves were analyzed by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test Microbiota changes
were analyzed with Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) software using principal component analysis as measured by
Bray-Curtis. The Chi-square of the likelihood ratio test in phyloseq DESeq2 was used to determine differences between groups as in
(McMurdie and Holmes, 2013). In order to avoid the challenges of multiple testing correction, two datasets for the young and old
microbiota samples were generated from samples gathered approximately 6 months apart from at least 5 different cages of mice.
A list of OTUs representing families or genuses which changed in abundance in old SPF mice was created and statistically significant
differences in the second dataset were determined using Welch’s unequal variances t test. Data from the second dataset are pre-
sented in Tables 1 and 2. No evidence of cage effects was found. Bray-Curtis distances were calculated and interactions between
age and treatment were tested using the permanova test ‘adonis’ from the ‘vegan’ package in R.
