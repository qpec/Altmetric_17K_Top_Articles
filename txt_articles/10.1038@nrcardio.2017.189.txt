 Advances in our understanding of the risk factors for 
cardio 
vascular disease have been extraordinary given that 
the first cohort studies on cardiovascular disease, such 
as the Minnesota Business and Professional Men study1, the 
Framingham Heart study2, and the British Doctors study3, 
were initiated only 6 or 7 decades ago. Since that time, 
declines in age-specific cardiovascular disease rates have 
been enormous, more than those for cancer and neuro-
logical disorders4. According to the Global Burden of 
Disease estimates, between 1990 and 2016, age-standard-
ized life-years lived with ischaemic heart disease declined 
by 47% and those of cerebrovascular disease by 17%4. 
Reductions in known cardiovascular disease risk factors, 
such as smoking, blood-pressure levels, and serum chol-
esterol levels, have helped prevent the disease5,6. In addi-
tion, the prognosis of cardiovascular disease has improved 
because of better medical care, including diagnosis, 
 
treatment of acute events, and care after hospital stay5,6.
Despite this progress, coronary heart disease and 
stroke remain the two leading causes of disease burden 
globally4. From 2006 to 2016, the number of people dying 
from cardiovascular disease actually increased by 15%, 
reaching 17.6 million deaths per year, because of popula-
tion ageing and growth4. The number of years lost owing 
to ill health, disability, or early death from cardio 
vascular 
disease is 18 times higher than the number of cardio-
vascular deaths, at 321.9 million per year7. These rates 
underline the continuing need to identify new comple-
mentary targets for prevention and to evaluate the future 
potential of therapeutic management of patients.
One emerging risk and prognostic factor for cardio-
vascular disease is stress, the topic of this Review. A large 
body of prospective research links stress to increased 
rates of coronary heart disease, stroke, and other presen-
tations of cardiovascular disease, such as atrial fibrilla-
tion. In addition, analyses of prospective follow-up data 
from 27,461–603,838 adults confirm outcome specifi-
city, supporting the associations of stress with cardio-
vascular disease8–11, diabetes mellitus12–14, and mental 
health15, but not with cancer (all sites or lung, prostate, 
breast, colon, or  
rectum cancer)16,17 or with diseases in the 
 
gastrointestinal18 and respiratory systems19,20.

Effects of stress on the development 
and progression of cardiovascular 
disease
Mika Kivimäki1 and Andrew Steptoe2
Abstract | Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of disease burden globally, which 
underlies the continuing need to identify new complementary targets for prevention. Over the 
past 5–10 years, the pooling of multiple data sets into ‘mega-studies’ has accelerated progress in 
research on stress as a risk and prognostic factor for cardiovascular disease. Severe stressful 
experiences in childhood, such as physical abuse and household substance abuse, can damage 
health and increase the risk of multiple chronic conditions in adulthood. Compared with childhood 
stress and adulthood classic risk factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure, and high serum 
cholesterol levels, the harmful effects of stress in adulthood are generally less marked. However, 
adulthood stress has an important role as a disease trigger in individuals who already have a high 
atherosclerotic plaque burden, and as a determinant of prognosis and outcome in those with 
pre-existing cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. In real-life settings, mechanistic studies 
have corroborated earlier laboratory-based observations on stress-related pathophysiological 
changes that underlie triggering, such as lowered arrhythmic threshold and increased sympathetic 
activation with related increases in blood pressure, as well as pro-inflammatory and procoagulant 
responses. In some clinical guidelines, stress is already acknowledged as a target for prevention 
for people at high overall risk of cardiovascular disease or with established cardiovascular disease. 
However, few scalable, evidence-based interventions are currently available.

 In this Review, we assess the current evidence for stress 
as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Our main focus 
is on reproducible findings obtained from the largest 
stress studies to date and the most recent literature-based 
and individual-participant data meta-analyses. Rather 
than just updating previous field synopses21–26, we seek 
to determine the clinical and public health importance of 
major stressors in relation to various presentations 
of cardio 
vascular disease and to provide comparisons 
to more established risk factors and treatments, such as 
smoking, physical activity, and statin therapy. To cover 
the multiple roles of stress in cardiovascular pathology, 
this Review is organized according to the disease pro-
cess, from the long-term development of atherosclerosis 
to subclinical disease, and the acute triggering of cardiac 
or cerebro 
vascular events in people with advanced under-
lying disease. In addition to this aetiological process, 
stress is thought to impair recovery, accelerate the pro-
gression of the disease, and contribute to cardiovascular 
death among patients who have survived an acute coro-
nary syndrome or stroke; in other words, stress might 
act as a prognostic factor. We conclude this Review with 
a discussion of the implications of managing stress for 
 
cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment.
Measurement of stress
The most commonly studied adult stressors include stress 
at work and social isolation22, although other stressors, 
such as marital problems, caring for a sick spouse or child 
at home, and the death of a close person, have also been 
linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease27–29. 
Other stressors include natural and man-made disasters 
(for example, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, and wars) 
that elicit clinical events and cardiac abnormalities30,31. 
Commonly studied episodic stressors include emotional 
upset, sporting events, and stressful changes at work, 
such as layoffs32,33. In this Review, we discuss evidence 
on all these stressors and also on overall perceived stress, 
because previous reviews have discussed depression34−36, 
anxiety37, common mental disorder and/or psychological 
distress38, vital exhaustion39, and post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD)40, which, despite being correlates of 
stress, are consequences rather than sources of stress. 
Various personality types or personality characteristics 
have been considered as risk factors for experiencing 
both stress and cardiovascular disease. These person 
ality 
factors have been addressed in previous publications, 
and include the type A behaviour pattern41 and type D 
 
personality42, as well as anger-proneness and hostility43.
At least three distinct approaches are available to 
measure stress: self-report (perception), external obser-
vation, and biomarkers (BOX 1). Although self- 
completion 
questionnaires and interviews are still the most com-
monly used methods, new technology is increasingly 
providing opportunities to make progress in stress 
measurement. Mobile health (mHealth) applications 
on mobile telephones and wearable devices for inter-
active communication allow more precise monitoring 
of specific stress exposures and their timing in relation 
to physiological changes44. For example, PTSD Coach 
is a smartphone application designed to help individ-
uals who have PTSD measure and self-manage their 
symptoms45. The use of biomarkers includes measur-
ing stress on a moment-to-moment basis (for exam-
ple, via salivary corti 
sol) and summary measures over 
longer time spans (for example, 3-month cortisol assay 
by hair sample analysis). A wide range of mobile, even 
wearable electrochemical sensors and biosensors has 
been developed for real-time, noninvasive monitor-
ing of electrolytes and metabolites in sweat or saliva as 
indicators of a wearer’s biological status44. For example, 
surface- 
enhanced Raman spectro 
scopy biosensor assays 
have been developed to detect cortisol levels in saliva46, 
and stored electrocardiograms (ECGs) from implantable 
cardioverter– 
defibrillators can be used as real-time data 
to investigate associations of stress with arrhythmia47.
Scale of the problem
Pooling of multiple, individual-level prospective data 
sets into mega-studies involving hundreds of thousands 
of participants has accelerated the progress of research 
on stress and cardiovascular disease, corresponding to 
developments in genetic approaches and study of  
classic 
cardiovascular risk factors. For stress research, these 
mega-studies are a fairly recent paradigm shift, as major 
multicohort consortia, such as the IPD-Work consor-
tium, were established <10 years ago48,49. Combining 
data across studies has several advantages. Pooled data 
increase the precision (but not necessarily the accuracy) 
of effect estimates and the power to detect weak signals 
between the risk factor and the disease. Further advan-
tages include the possibility of testing the robustness of 
associations across subgroups to examine whether the 
observed relation 
ship is a result of a third factor (con-
founder). In addition, convincingly showing and pub-
lishing the absence of  
associations is possible with large 
data sets.
Risk factors doubling the likelihood of developing a 
disease are considered to have a large effect size50. For 
example, meta-analyses have reported a hazard ratio 
of ≥2 for the associations of classic risk factors, such as 
Key points
• Pooling of individual-level data and published data from multiple cohorts into 
mega-studies has allowed for a more precise assessment of the association between 
stress and cardiovascular disease
• In the general population, adults with work stress or private-life stress have a  
1.1-fold to 1.6-fold increased risk of incident coronary heart disease and stroke
• The excess risk of cardiovascular disease associated with adulthood stress is less 
marked than the risks associated with smoking, high blood pressure, high serum 
cholesterol levels, obesity, or multiple severe stressful experiences in childhood
• Stress in adulthood has an important role as a disease trigger in individuals with 
high atherosclerotic plaque burden and as a determinant of prognosis and outcomes 
in those with pre-existing cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease
• Potential pathophysiological effects of stress involve increased cardiac electrical 
instability, myocardial ischaemia, plaque disruption, and thrombus formation, 
contributing to clinical events such as arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, 
cardiomyopathy, and stroke
• Only European guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention acknowledge stress 
as a clinically meaningful risk factor in individuals with a high overall risk of 
cardiovascular disease or with established cardiovascular disease

 diabetes and midlife high blood-pressure levels, with 
coronary heart disease and ischaemic stroke51,52. Meta-
analyses have also demonstrated a strong association 
between high serum cholesterol levels before the age 
of 50 years and vascular-related death53. Severe obesity 
(BMI >35 kg/m2) doubles the risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease and increases the risk of comorbid cardiovascular 
disease and diabetes more than 10-fold54. The rates of 
myocardial infarction in smokers are more than two 
times those in non-smokers55.
FIGURE 1 summarizes evidence on stress as a predictor 
of cardiovascular disease and death from meta- 
analyses 
 
of published papers and from pooled analyses of 
individual- 
participant data from multiple cohort stud-
ies. Whereas the exposure and outcome definitions were 
hetero 
geneous in published studies, many individual- 
participant data analyses used predefined and harmo-
nised exposures, an approach that reduces bias owing to 
multiple testing48,49. The findings from the two types of 
multi 
cohort studies are consistent in showing that com-
pared with classic risk factors (high blood pressure, high 
serum cholesterol levels, obesity, diabetes, and smoking), 
the hazard ratios of incident coronary heart disease and 
ischaemic stroke for stress are less marked in the general 
population8–11,56,57. The only exception is the excess risk 
associated with a history of multiple severe stress experi-
ences in childhood, such as physical abuse and household 
substance abuse58. This association might be indirect, 
because individuals who have had such experiences are 
more than twice as likely to be smokers in adulthood 
and almost six times as likely to drink problem 
atically 
compared with those who did not have severe stress 
 
experiences in childhood58.
In contrast to the moderate associations of adulthood 
stress with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events 
in the general population, strong associations between 
stressors and cardiovascular disease have been observed 
in high-risk populations29,32,59,60. In combination, these 
observations suggest that stress in adulthood has a more 
pronounced role as a trigger of cardiovascular disease than 
as a contributor to the development of the disease (FIG. 1). 
In patients with cardiovascular disease, several stress-
ors have also been strongly correlated to cardio 
vascular 
end points, such as recurrent cardiovascular events and 
mortality61–65. This observation indicates that stress in 
adulthood might also have a more important role in the 
progression and outcome of cardiovascular disease than 
 
as a contributor of the development of the disease.
In general, strong multivariable-adjusted associ-
ations are less likely to be confounded than weak multi-
variable-adjusted associations. For example, the 4.7-fold 
excess risk of a cardiac event during an anger outburst in 
individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease60 could 
be explained away only if an unmeasured confounder 
was associated with both stress and cardiac events with 
a hazard ratio as large as 9.0; a weaker uncontrolled con-
founder could not account for the association (FIG. 2). 
By contrast, an unmeasured confounder that doubled 
the likelihood of both work stress and stroke could 
explain the entire 1.3-fold increased risk of stroke among 
 
individuals working long hours10.
Stress mechanisms and pathophysiology
The acute stress response, an integrated cascade of 
physio 
logical reactions in the face of challenging situ-
ations, has been well described21,26. Much less is known 
about how stress responses convert to pathological 
changes over time, contributing to the development and 
progression of cardiovascular disease. Similarly, whereas 
the evidence quantifying links between various stressors 
and disease end points is rapidly accumulating (FIG. 1), 
less progress has been made in understanding which 
speci 
fic pathophysiological changes underlie these links. 
In the following section, we describe the main features 
of the acute stress response and review the evidence 
on stress-related pathophysiological changes, related 
both to atherosclerosis and to the triggering of major 
 
cardiovascular events (FIG. 3).
Acute stress response
Activation of the stress response produces changes in 
brain stress-responsive neurocircuitry, affecting vigilance 
to sensory stimuli, producing emotional responses of fear 
and avoidance, and stimulating peripheral physio 
logical 
responses21. Peripheral physiological responses include 
the autonomic nervous system response, hypothalamus– 
pituitary–adrenal (HPA) responses, and elevation of 
the levels of inflammatory proteins in the absence 
of  
pathogens (known as sterile inflammation)23,66.
Autonomic nervous system response. Briefly, the auto-
nomic nervous system, which innervates nearly all 
organs of the body, activates within seconds after 
exposure to a stressor, inducing both sympathetic and 
parasympathetic nervous system responses. The cate-
cho 
lamines adrenaline (released by the adrenal medulla) 
and noradrenaline (released by the sympa 
thetic nerve 
terminals) increase the heart rate and decrease heart 
rate variability, optimize blood flow to muscle tissues, 
and elevate core body temperature67. The sympathetic 
nervous system has direct cardiostimulatory effects 
(chronotropy and inotropy via β1-adrenergic receptors) 
and pressor effects (via α1-adrenergic receptors) and 
also affects metabolism (promotes insulin resistance 
and lipolysis) and the immune system68,69, including

 inhibition of mast-cell degranulation by stimu 
lation of 
IL-6 release (a pro-inflammatory cytokine). The para-
sympathetic nervous system releases acetylcholine to 
inhibit sympathetic nervous system drive to the tissues. 
However, the stress-related regulatory process is often 
characterized by removal of sympathetic inhibition to 
enhance excitation. For example, the stress response 
can involve initial simultaneous activation of both the 
sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, followed by 
parasympathetic nervous system withdrawal to sustain 
stress-evoked  
elevated heart rate70.
Hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal responses. The HPA 
axis activates within minutes of exposure to a stressor. 
The hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hor-
mone in the anterior pituitary67. Corticotropin-releasing 
hormone stimulates the release of adrenocortico-
tropic hormone into the blood circulation, which in turn 
stimu 
lates the adrenal cortex to release the gluco 
corti 
coid 
cortisol, producing increases in blood  
glucose  
levels71. 
When the circulating glucose level is high, β-cells in the 
pancreas release insulin, which promotes the absorption 
of glucose from the blood into fat  
tissues, the liver, and 
skeletal muscle cells. In combination, the autonomic 
nervous system and HPA-axis response affect haemo-
static factors, increasing platelet activation, fibrinogen 
levels, viscosity, and coagulation factors.
Inflammatory response. Activation of the stress sys-
tem, especially after severe stressors, with the ensuing 
increase in circulating catecholamines can stimulate 
exosomal damage and the release of danger-associated 
molecular patterns (DAMPs)66, which are endogenous 
molecules that can stimulate an inflammatory response. 
The stress response might also reduce the exosomal 
cargo of immunoinhibitory microRNAs, a further  
factor 
contributing to stress-related sterile inflammation66. 
One of the puzzles of the stress response is the simul-
taneous increase in inflammation and gluco 
corticoid 
levels, such as cortisol, given that steroid hormones are 
anti-inflammatory. One explanation is that chronic or 
repeated exposure to a stressor leads to exhaustion of

 the stress response, contributing to chronic low-grade 
inflammation and antigen-specific immunosuppres-
sion66. Furthermore, cortisol might only limit inflam-
matory responses, and the pro-inflammatory cytokine 
expression induced by stress would be much greater in 
the absence of increased cortisol72. In addition, gluco-
corticoids can have pro-inflammatory effects under 
some circumstances. In vitro administration of gluco-
corticoids induces an increase in cytokine produc-
tion and the activ 
ation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) 
in isolated macro 
phages73, and pretreatment of healthy 
individuals with cortisol enhances the production 
of IL-6 in response to a subsequent endotoxin chal-
lenge74. Glucocorticoid responses to stress have been 
proposed to be neuro 
endocrine warning signals to the 
innate immune system, sensitizing neuro 
inflammatory 
processes even after the corticosteroid response 
has dissipated75.
Pathophysiological changes
Stress-related changes in the sympathetic– 
parasympa-
thetic balance and the tone of the HPA axis might 
adversely affect the cardiovascular system both by 
acceler 
ating the atherosclerotic process and by precipi-
tating the occurrence of a cardiovascular or cerebro-
vascular event26. Whereas the pathophysiological effects 
on the progression of atherosclerosis are likely to involve 
repeated or chronic exposure to stress, stress- 
related 
trigger 
ing of events among people with an already 
high atherosclerotic plaque burden might also be a 
 
consequence of acute stress responses.
Atherosclerosis and metabolic dysregulation. In the 
general population, combined long-term effects of 
dysfunction of both the autonomic nervous system 
and HPA-axis can, in principle, contribute to changes 
that accelerate atherosclerosis, such as increases in 
blood-pressure levels and imbalance between vaso-
dilatating and vasoconstricting substances produced by, 
or acting on, the endothelium21. However, no consist-
ent evidence demonstrates an association of stress with 
major atherosclerosis risk factors such as hypertension 
and LDL-cholesterol levels76–80 (TABLE 1). By contrast, 
stress has been linked to an increased risk of developing 
diabetes14, a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, 
ischaemic stroke, and haemorrhagic stroke51 (TABLE 1). 
This association was observed both among individ-
uals with a healthy lifestyle and those with unhealthy 
lifestyle factors12,14.
The mechanisms underlying the increased risk of 
developing cardiovascular disease among individuals 
with stress can also be indirect via lifestyle changes 
that accelerate atherosclerosis and metabolic dysregu-
lation. For example, a marginal increase in smoking 
frequency has been observed in smokers under stress81, 
and meta-analyses show that individuals with extensive 
working hours are more likely to increase their alcohol 
use to levels that pose a health risk82. Evidence also sug-
gests that work-related stress is associated with reduced 
leisure-time physical activity83. In the British Whitehall II 
study84, participants with long-term stress were more 
likely to have an unhealthy diet than those participants 
free of stress. Furthermore, at least two meta-analyses, 
one based on published studies85 and another com-
bining published and  
unpublished individual- 
level 
data86, confirmed an association between stress and 
obesity. However, the association of stress with weight 
change seems to be complex as some individuals tend to 
lose weight under stress, others gain weight, and others 
 
experience no changes87.
Triggering of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events. 
The potential of psychological stress to trigger myo-
cardial ischaemia in people with underlying coronary 
arterial disease was recognized several hundred years 
ago88. The first detailed description of angina  
pectoris 
in the medical literature in 1772 noted that angina 
pectoris “is increased by disturbance of the mind” 
(REF. 89). Numerous independent studies have subse-
quently confirmed this statement in experimental and 
real-life settings90–96.
Among individuals who already have a high athero-
sclerotic plaque burden, multiple stress-related mech-
anisms can act as triggers that precipitate the occurrence 
of a cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event97 (FIG. 3). 
The common pathology in acute cardiovascular events 
is rupture or disruption of the fibrous cap of the athero-
sclerotic plaque coupled with active inflammation and 
hypercoagulability, which are the result of multiple 
processes98–100. Relevant physiological changes, in addi-
tion to stress-induced ischaemia, include: an increase 
in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhe-
sion molecules that contribute to athero 
sclerotic plaque 
destabiliza 
tion and monocyte chemotaxis; release of 
 
tissue factor; increased blood viscosity; platelet activ-
ation and increases in the levels of coagulation and 
fibrinolytic factors and in the hepatic production 
of fibrinogen (an acute-phase protein important in both 
coagulation and whole blood viscosity); systemic vaso-
constriction and an increase in arterial blood- 
pressure 
levels; increases in sinus node firing rates and atrio-
ventricular conduction velocity, thereby increasing the 
heart rate; changes in the balance between sympathetic

analyses adjusted for a number of classic risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), 
residual confounding by unmeasured or imprecisely measured risk factors for CVD that 
are associated with both the stressor and the risk of CVD remains possible. Evaluation 
of unmeasured confounding that could explain the observed associations between 
stress and CVD is shown for the general population (left panel) and a subgroup of 
individuals with high overall risk of CVD (right panel). An unmeasured confounder 
should be associated with a doubling of the likelihood of stress and CVD to explain the 
observed association in the general population (relative risk (RR) 1.3) and with ninefold 
increased risk of stress and CVD to explain the observed association in individuals at high 
overall risk of CVD (RR 4.7).

 and para 
sympathetic cardiac control in favour of the for-
mer; and increases in myocardial oxygen consumption 
and myocardial work101.
These physiological responses interact with one 
another; for example, reduced parasympathetic activity 
correlates with systemic inflammation and catechola-
mine release promotes cardiac repolarization abnormali-
ties, whereas heightened haemodynamic responses are 
associated with increased plasma viscosity102–104. These 
responses, in turn, stimulate pathophysiological effects, 
including electrical instability of the heart and transient 
myocardial ischaemia as well as plaque disruption and 
thrombus formation. Acute clinical events can occur, 
such as ventricular fibrillation, myocardial infarction, 
or stroke (FIG. 3).
As shown in FIG. 4, the findings from large-scale popu-
lation studies are consistent with the above- 
described 
process and show that stress is linked to both increased 
systemic inflammation and coagulation and/or viscosity 
as indicated by high platelet levels78 and excess risk of 
pulmonary embolism29. Stress is also related to cardiac 
arrhythmia79, elevated ambulatory blood pressure105 — 
a measure that is more sensitive to temporary elevations 
in blood pressure than clinic-assessed blood pressure — 
and increased alcohol use in men78,82,106, three additional 
factors that can precipitate the rupture of vulnerable 
 
atherosclerotic plaque or the formation of blood clots.
Studies that used online diary (eDiary) assessments of 
emotions combined with portable devices that continu-
ously monitor electrical activity of the heart confirmed 
that stress often precedes arrhythmia episodes47,107. 
In atrial fibrillation — the most common form of clin-
ical cardiac arrhythmia — the irregular rhythm can cause 
blood to pool in the left atrium and form clots that can 
travel to the brain and cause a stroke. An individual- 
participant meta-analysis published in 2017 that included 
nearly 85,500 men and women showed that people who 
work long hours have an increased risk of develop-
ing atrial fibrillation79. This association was evident in 
individ 
uals with no history of coronary heart disease or 
stroke, suggesting that the adverse effects of this stressor 
on atrial fibrillation are not attributable to pre-existing 
cardiovascular disease. This finding is consistent with the 
hypothesis that stress-induced arrhythmias might in part 
mediate the association between stress and increased risk 
of stroke10.
Mechanisms of stress in the brain. Other advances in 
the study of stress mechanisms have focused on the 
central nervous system rather than peripheral physio-
logical responses affecting the heart and vessels. Resting 
metabolic activity within the amygdala (a region of the 
brain implicated in emotional experience) was associated 
with the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in a 
Figure 3 | Effects of stress. Schematic model of the physiological responses and pathophysiological effects of stress that 
contribute to the triggering of cardiovascular events. The response to emotional stress involves changes in the function 
of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal cortex axis and the autonomic nervous system. Among individuals who already 
have a high atherosclerotic plaque burden, stress might be the trigger that precipitates the occurrence of a cardiac or 
cerebrovascular event. The common pathology in acute cardiac events is rupture or disruption of the fibrous cap of the 
atherosclerotic plaque, coupled with active inflammation and hypercoagulability. Cardiac electrical instability, myocardial 
ischaemia, and possibly excessive levels of circulating catecholamines are also contributing factors. Stress-related clinical 
events include ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction and other forms 
of acute coronary syndromes (for example, unstable angina and stress cardiomyopathy), and stroke.

 4-year follow-up study of 300 participants (median age 
55 years): the higher the amygdala activity, the higher the 
risk of cardiovascular disease108. Amygdala hyperactiv-
ity was related to conventional stress mechanisms, such 
as arterial inflammation measured by arterial ¹⁸F-FDG 
uptake, in line with findings from experimental studies109. 
These observations are preliminary, but give rise to the 
hypothesis that the amygdala could be a critical struc-
ture in the central nervous system mechanisms linking 
stress to cardiovascular disease events. Additionally, the 
dorsal anterior cingulate cortex is particularly involved 
in the regulation of cardiovascular responses to acute 
challenge110, and inflammatory cytokine expression 
after reappraisal of emotional stimuli links this neural 
region with preclinical atherosclerosis111. Conversely, 
greater  
levels of social support, which might be cardio-
protective, are associated with diminished activity in the 
dorsal  
anterior cingulate cortex112.
Reduced self-care. Finally, it has been suggested that 
stressed individuals with cardiovascular disease have 
poorer self-care, are more likely to ignore symptoms of 
disease, and have longer prehospital delays related to 
acute cardiovascular events than individuals who are free 
of stress113. Patients with heart failure and coro 
nary heart 
disease who become depressed show poor self-care and 
reduced adherence to medication114,115. In addition, stress 
has been linked to reduced chances of successful modifi-
cation of risk factors (such as  
smoking cessation)116 and 
high stress can also adversely affect  
participation in 
 
rehabilitation among patients62.

 and increase the risk of multiple chronic conditions 
in adulthood. In a meta-analysis of >120,000 partici-
pants from eight studies, individuals with at least four 
adverse childhood experiences were at a higher risk of 
future cardiovascular disease than those with no such 
experience (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.7–2.6)58. In these individ-
uals, the risk ratios for adverse behavioural and mental 
health outcomes in adulthood, such as sexual risk taking, 
psychi 
atric disorders, drug use, and problematic alcohol 
use, were higher than the risk of cardiovascular disease, 
 
varying between 3 and 6 (REF. 58).
In adult general populations, the observed associ-
ations between chronic stress and risk of cardiovascular 
disease have been weaker8,22,117 (FIG. 1). A meta-analysis 
of first cardiac events in the general population showed 
a 1.5-fold (95% CI 1.2–1.9) pooled relative risk related 
to social isolation or loneliness compared with other 
stressors across nine cohort studies23. The risk ratio for 
coronary heart disease was 1.4-fold (95% CI 1.1–1.8) 
for people experiencing multiple work stressors (high 
workload combined with low control over work, plus 
high efforts relative to income, job security, or recog-
nition) compared with people with low work stress9. 
These associations remained robust after exclusion of 
the first 3 or 5 years of follow-up, suggesting that the 
associ 
ation is not attributable to bias arising from 
the effects of  
pre-existing cardiovascular disease on 
stress levels9,48.
Research on other presentations of cardiovascular 
disease includes studies on stroke and atrial fibril-
lation. A pooled analysis of unpublished and pub-
lished data on >500,000 men and women found that 
individuals working long hours (≥55 h per week) had 
a 1.3 times (95% CI 1.1–1.6) higher risk of incident 
stroke than individuals working the standard 35–40 h 
per week10. A similar association between isolation or 
loneliness and stroke incidence was reported in another 
meta-analysis, with a relative risk of 1.3 (1.0–1.7) that 
was unchanged when studies that might have informa-
tion bias were excluded56. Job strain was associated with 
a 1.2-fold (95% CI 1.1–1.5) increased risk of ischaemic 
stroke, but no association was found with haemor-
rhagic stroke57. In addition, individuals with long work-
ing hours and job strain were more likely to develop 
atrial fibrillation79,118,119.
Disease triggering
In investigating triggering, researchers have exploited 
natural experiment designs that include a change in 
stress level owing to an adverse life event. This design 
does not rely on randomization and is, therefore, sub-
ject to confounding and bias, but probably to a lesser 
extent than traditional prospective studies with a single 
 
baseline assessment and follow-up of the outcome.
Natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurri-
canes, as well as unnatural events (for example, threat 
of imminent missile attack) have been associated with 
increases in cardiovascular events immediately after the 
disaster120–123. Excess cardiovascular event rates have 
been observed even in major sporting competitions124,125. 
In a German study, for example, the incidence of acute 
cardiac events was 2.0 times higher (95% CI 1.7–2.4) 
on match days involving the German national team 
during the 2006 FIFA World Cup than in the control 
period63 (FIG. 1).
Other triggers, such as the death of a close person, 
exceptionally stressful work changes, and emotional 
upset, have also been associated with considerable 
increases in the risk of both cardiovascular events 
and death29,32,33,60,126–129 (FIG. 1). For example, a matched 
Figure 4 | Stress and factors linked to disease triggering. Summary of the 
meta-analyses and large-scale studies on the associations between 
adulthood stress and factors that increase the risk of rupture or disruption 
of the fibrous cap of the atherosclerotic plaque and subsequent thrombus 
formation, leading to cardiac or cerebrovascular events. The associations 
of adulthood stress with high work-time ambulatory blood pressure, 
increased risk of atrial fibrillation and pulmonary embolisms, high platelet 
and white cell counts, and increased alcohol consumption (indicated by 
elevated γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels and self-reported increasing 
alcohol use) support the notion that stress contributes to the triggering of 
cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Strong associations are shown with red

 cohort study using the UK primary-care database, 
which included >30,000 elderly people with experience 
of partner bereavement and >83,000 matched non- 
bereavement controls, showed that within a month of 
the partner’s death the risk of cardiovascular disease 
in the bereaved compared with the non-bereaved group 
was 2.1-fold for myocardial infarction and 2.4-fold for 
stroke29. Moreover, the bereaved group had a 2.2-fold 
increased risk of acute coronary syndromes other than 
myocardial infarction and a 2.4-fold risk of pulmonary 
embolism in the first 90 days.
The large INTERHEART study32, conducted in 
52 countries with a case-control design, found that 
anger or emotional upset in the case period immediately 
preceding symptom onset was associated with 2.4-times 
increased odds of acute myocardial infarction (99% CI 
2.1–2.9), with no effect modification by geographical 
region, prior cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular 
risk factor burden, cardiovascular disease prevention 
medica 
tions, or time of day or day of onset of the infarc-
tion. Other studies have shown that the stress induced 
by receiving a diagnosis of cancer might have serious 
consequences. In a cohort study of >6 million adults, the 
relative risk of cardiovascular death after cancer diagno-
sis was 5.6 (95% CI 5.2–5.9) during the first week and 3.3 
(95% CI 3.1–3.4) during the first 4 weeks129.
An advanced approach, known as case- 
crossover 
design, is based on within-person comparisons 
between a hazard period before symptom onset and a 
control period in the same individual, thereby taking 
into account base-rate issues and individual differences 
between patients and controls130. A meta-analysis pub-
lished in 2013 identified five studies that used a com-
parable time period of 24 h before the hazard period as 
a control23. In this analysis, the pooled relative risk of 
symptom onset for acute coronary syndrome in  
periods 
of stress, anger, or depressed mood was 2.5 (95% CI 
1.7–3.5). Single studies have reported even larger effects. 
Mostofsky and others60, for example, found an incidence 
of acute cardiac event as high as 21-fold in the 24 h 
follow 
ing the death of a close person60. This finding is in 
agreement with a previous case-crossover study report-
ing an odds ratio of 14.0 (95% CI 4.4–89.7) for negative 
emotions in the 2 h before stroke onset131. When major 
stressful events in the month before ischaemic stroke are 
considered, the increased risk might be lower, at 3.0-fold 
(95% CI 2.2–4.0), but still substantial132.
Major downsizing in workplaces that have tradition-
ally provided stable employment, such as public-sector 
organizations in Finland before the major economic 
recession in the 1990s, is a potential stressor not only 
for those who lose their jobs, but also for employees 
who continue working in heavily downsized units 
with increasing workloads133. According to one analy-
sis, Finnish public-sector employees remaining in 
their organizations after downsizing in the 1990s had a 
2.0-fold (95% CI 1.0–3.9) higher risk of cardiovascular 
death than those who worked in places where no down-
sizing had occured33. Splitting the follow-up period 
into two halves produced a 5.1-fold (95% CI 1.4–19.3) 
increase in cardiovascular mortality following major 
downsizing during the first years, but no excess risk 
was observed during the second half of the follow-up33. 
Given the long preclinical phase in cardiovascular dis-
ease, this finding suggests that the affected employees 
were those who already had underlying disease.
Besides the above-reviewed common presentations 
of cardiovascular disease, stress has been linked to 
stress cardiomyopathy, a transient systolic and diastolic 
left ventricular dysfunction with wall-motion abnor-
malities often accompanied with emotional or phys-
ical stress134–136. Stress cardiomyopathy is considered 
an acute heart failure syndrome136, and one hypothesis 
is that an overstimulation of the sympathetic nervous 
system resulting in a cardiotoxic discharge of circulat-
ing catecholamines has a role in this acute coronary 
syndrome135,137. Data from cohort studies and regis-
tries suggest that more than half of patients with stress 
cardio 
myopathy have a history of psychiatric or neuro-
logical disorders, supporting a neurogenic origin for 
this condition136.
Stress and disease progression
In aetiological research, the aim is to examine whether 
the development of a disease can be reliably attributed 
to a particular risk factor. However, both episodic and 
chronic stress can also affect the outcomes of the disease 
and its course and progression. This type of research is 
prognostic as the aim is to examine factors that affect 
the risk of future adverse outcomes in individuals who 
already have cardiovascular disease.
Arrhythmias, particularly ventricular tachy 
cardia and 
ventricular fibrillation, are common causes of sudden 
cardiac death. Implantable cardioverter– 
defibrillators 
are used in the management of ventricular arrhyth-
mia and stored ECGs from these devices have been 
used to investi 
gate associations of stress with arrhyth-
mia in patients with coronary heart disease. A case- 
crossover study showed that approximately 15% of atrial 
arrhythmias leading to discharge of the implantable 
cardioverter– 
defibrillator were preceded by neg 
ative 
emotion, compared with 3% in the control periods, a five-
fold difference47. Another study of patients with implant-
able cardioverter–defibrillators showed that ventricu 
lar 
tachyarrhythmias increased significantly in the 30 days 
following the terrorist attacks of 11th September 2001 in 
the USA compared with the control months138.
Work stress has been linked to an increased risk 
of recurrent cardiac events in patients with coronary 
heart disease, but the sample size in these studies has 
typically been small and the findings were not entirely 
consistent27,139–143. A more holistic assessment of per-
ceived life stress, irrespective of the source, has yielded 
clearer findings. A measure combining work, family, 
and life-event stress predicted increased 3-year mortal-
ity in the β-Blocker Heart Attack trial, and the effect was 
accentu 
ated when coupled with social isolation144. In a 
cohort study of 4,200 patients with acute myo 
cardial 
infarction published in 2012, participants who were 
stressed had an elevated 2-year risk of death compared 
with those who were not stressed, the mortality being 
12.9% and 8.6%, respectively62. This association was not

 attributable to sociodemographic differences, clinical 
factors, revascularization status, or discharge risk as 
indicated by the confounder-adjusted hazard ratio of 1.4 
(95% CI 1.2–1.8) for mortality under stress  
compared 
with no stress.
As summarized in FIG. 1, to date, few studies have 
examined the association between stress and disease 
progression. Given the promising findings, this field 
would merit more high-quality research.
Prevention and treatment
Preventive recommendations need to be justified by 
strong evidence, because non-evidence-based interven-
tions might expose the target population to potentially 
harmful or ineffective strategies, and the use of such 
interventions might also divert attention and resources 
from strategies that might be more effective145.
The two major approaches to prevention are a univer-
sal (population-wide) strategy and a targeted strategy, 
the first involving the general population and the latter 
being focused on those at the highest risk of adverse end 
points146. The number-needed-to-treat (NNT) is a simple 
 
statistic to evaluate cost- 
effectiveness and is defined as 
the number of individuals who should be intervened 
to prevent one extra event. In TABLE 2, we provide the 
NNT to prevent one additional cardio 
vascular event 
for various interventions and risk  
factors to illustrate 
that the unit cost should be lower for population-wide 
interventions than for targeted interventions in order to 
achieve the same cost- 
effectiveness48,147–151. Accordingly, 
in the general working population, 550 employees with-
out coronary heart disease and with job strain should 
become free of job strain to prevent one myocardial 
infarction or cardiac death within 5 years48. The NNT 
in the general population for increase in physical activ-
ity to a level recommended by the WHO (>150 min per 
week of moderate- 
intensity physical activity) is 310 
to prevent one myocardial infarction and 195 to pre-
vent one major cardiovascular event within 5 years148. 
For statin and antihypertensive pharmacotherapy, the 
NNT to prevent one major cardio 
vascular event is 
80 for a targeted group of individ 
uals at intermediate 
risk of cardiovascular disease149. The corresponding 
NNT for antihypertensive medication alone is 70 for 
people with hypertension147, and the NNT for  
statin 
treatment alone is 18 for patients with established 
cardiovascular disease151.
The relevance of stress as a target for cardiovascular 
disease prevention, universal or targeted, remains under 
debate. At least four alternative scenarios exist for such 
prevention. First, stress considered as a universal risk 
factor: this strategy is the most far-reaching option, 
encouraging the entire population to reduce stress or its 
adverse effects. Second, stress treated as a risk factor in 
high-risk groups only: this option assumes the associ-
ation between stress and cardiovascular disease is causal, 
but only targeted anti-stress interventions are clinically 
meaningful and cost-effective. Third, stress considered 
only a risk marker: under this scenario, stress is treated 
as a risk marker to identify at-risk groups for targeted 
prevention that focuses on the management of standard 
cardiovascular risk factors in this group. Fourth, wait for 
more definite evidence: this option is to defer the inclu-
sion of stressors in universal or targeted cardiovascular 
disease prevention programmes until better evidence 
is forthcoming152.
Universal strategies
Data from randomized, general-population trials on 
stress and cardiovascular disease are limited; the few 
intervention studies available are small in scale and are 
based on case-specific, tailor-made solutions rather than 
scalable interventions153,154. A major barrier for large 
intervention studies is the practical challenge of modify-
ing stressors in healthy individuals, because methods of 
stress intervention are often time consuming and diffi-
cult to implement at the population level. Adherence is 
poor even for treatments as simple as taking a pill once a 
day to lower blood pressure or cholesterol levels. In stress 
management interventions, which might require study 
participants to modify long-held habits, the adherence 
problem is orders of magnitude greater. A further  
barrier 
is funding; large drug trials are expensive, but are also 
often profitable investments for the pharmaceutical 
industry. For stress intervention studies, however, the 
financial incentives for industrial partners are less clear.

 Natural (nonrandomized) experiments might be infor-
mative. A far-reaching, population-wide option against 
 
stress in the general population is to legislate against com-
mon stressors in the same way as other health  
hazards are 
dealt with, for example, exposure to chemical toxins. This 
approach has been adopted at least in work stress. One 
example comes from the European Union and Canada, 
where legislation that provides workers with the right 
to cap their working hours at 48 h per average week has 
been implemented155. Another example is a French law 
for employees’ “right to disconnect” (REF. 156). This 
law requires companies to establish hours when staff 
should not send or answer emails, with a view to ensur-
ing rest periods and preventing burnout by protecting 
private time. Neither of these laws was enacted with 
cardio 
vascular disease prevention in mind. Nonetheless, 
analy 
ses of risk of cardiovascular disease before and after 
the implementation of the legislation, with comparisons 
to countries with no such policy, could provide an oppor-
tunity to evaluate the effects of stress-related interven-
tions in the general population. We are not aware of the 
 
existence of such analyses.
Population-strategies for reducing the risk of acute 
triggering of cardiac events by stress might also be pos-
sible157. One possibility is increasing precautions in high-
risk situations, such as major sporting events and natural 
disasters. Improved access to defibrillators, public health 
awareness programmes, and education of emergency and 
health professional staff in the dangers of these settings 
would ensure more rapid responses to potentially fatal 
symptoms. Mobile technologies and mHealth interven-
tions might also offer ways of delivering mental health 
support to mitigate stress in people experiencing war, 
ethnic conflict, and human-caused and natural disasters. 
The platforms include social media, video teleconfer-
encing, text messaging, and smartphone-based applica-
tions (for example, PTSD Coach has been downloaded 
>243,000 times in 96 countries)158. To date, systematic 
research on the potential benefits of these interventions 
for cardiovascular disease prevention is not available.
For stressors that are difficult to manipulate, a way 
forward is to intervene on the intermediary factors 
that are downstream on the causal pathway and target 
them by proven, evidence-based prevention strategies. 
As cardiovascular disease is a multifactorial condition, 
removal of any of the standard risk factors would reduce 
overall risk. Accordingly, physical activity has been 
suggested as an intervention to mitigate adverse stress 
effects159. Indirect evidence supports this approach, with 
meta-analyses of trial findings showing that physical 
activity might alleviate distress feelings, such as depres-
sion and anxiety160, and extensive observational evidence 
support a protective effect of physical activity on cardio-
vascular disease148. Workplace wellness programmes, 
such as those promoted by the AHA, are designed to 
support healthy lifestyles, including routine health 
screenings and the facilitation of healthy eating, weight 
management, and physical activity161,162. These wellness 
programmes could also be beneficial for people under 
stress, although, again, systematic research on benefits 
and harms of these programmes is lacking.
Targeted strategies
FIGURE 5 illustrates that, in terms of reducing absolute risk, 
prevention and treatment focusing on individuals at high 
overall risk of cardiovascular disease32 and patients with 
pre-existing disease62 might seem a more attractive target 
group than the general population10. The rationale is that, 
for example, a 1.5-fold increase in relative risk of disease 
owing to stress would mean that a person with a high 
(>10%) overall risk of a cardiovascular disease event in 
the next 10 years on the basis of established risk factors 
would actually have a 15% overall risk after also account-
ing for stress. By contrast, in a person with a low (1%) 
overall risk of cardiovascular disease, a 1.5-fold excess risk 
of disease owing to stress would increase the  
overall 
risk only to 1.5%, a relatively trivial clinical difference.
The greatest stress effects are the triggering of cardio-
vascular events among individuals with high cardiovas-
cular risk or with established disease when exposed 
to stressful events, such as emotional upset, adverse 
changes at work, major life events, and natural and 
unnatural catastrophes. These stressors are difficult to 
address by interventions, because such events are typi-
cally stochastic and, therefore, are difficult to predict. 
For this reason, a more typical approach in targeted 
interventions involves strengthening stress management 
skills and psychosocial support more generally.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of psycho-
logical treatment among cardiac patients, published in 
2007, identified 43 relevant randomized trials, of which 
23 reported mortality data for almost 10,000 patients163. 
Figure 5 | Absolute risk difference between groups 
exposed and not exposed to stress. Estimated 5-year 
risk of incident disease or death by status of stress in 
stroke-free population10, coronary heart disease (CHD)-free 
population48, and high-risk population32, and in patients 
with a history of myocardial infarction (MI)62. The bars 
illustrate that given the low overall incidence rates, the 
difference in absolute disease risk between disease-free 
individuals with and without stress is small. By contrast, 
high-risk populations and patients with cardiovascular 
disease have high overall rates of morbidity and mortality, 
and in these groups, the moderately and strongly increased 
relative risk associated with stress translates to large 
differences in absolute risk between those exposed to 
stress versus those not exposed to stress.

 A benefit of the psychological treatment was observed 
among men in terms of reduced all-cause mortality at 
≤2 years of follow-up. The odds ratio for all-cause mortal-
ity for the comparison between the group receiving 
 
psychological treatment and usual care with the group 
receiving only usual care was 0.7 (95% CI 0.6–1.0) for 
men, but 1.0 (95% CI 0.9–1.7) for women. A longer 
 
follow- 
up attenuated this effect. Although some 
individ 
ual trials have shown impressive results for the 
use of psycho 
logical treatment for the prevention of 
cardio 
vascular disease164,165, summary evidence from a 
Cochrane review, published in 2017, of 35 studies includ-
ing a total of 10,703 patients with coronary heart disease 
showed little benefit at the population level166. The review 
suggests that psychological treatment might reduce car-
diac mortality, but the trials available had low quality 
and no robust data suggesting an effect of psychological 
treatment on total mortality, the risk of revascularization 
procedures, or the rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction.
Comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation for patients 
with cardiovascular disease often includes a psycho-
logical component related to lifestyle behaviour change, 
risk factor modification, and psychosocial well-being167. 
Although exercise training remains the cornerstone of 
cardiac rehabilitation, an additional goal is to offer stress 
management interventions for those in need168. Meta-
analyses suggest that exercise-based cardiac rehabilita-
tion is effective for reducing the risk of cardiovascular 
disease167,169, although notable exceptions have null find-
ings (for example, the large UK RAMIT trial170). Exercise 
training in patients with chronic disease might addition-
ally have stress-mitigating effects171. No specific cardio-
vascular benefits have been shown for including stress 
management as part of rehabilitation167,169.
Current clinical guidelines
Although findings from randomized, controlled trials are 
the gold standard evidence, such evidence is lacking for 
much of modern medical practice, and in many cases, 
no randomized, controlled trial is even being planned to 
provide evidence for action172. An argument that has been 
used to justify this practice is that waiting for more data is 
an implicit decision not to act or to act on the basis of past 
practice rather than best available evidence172.
The 2016 European clinical guidelines for the pre-
vention of cardiovascular disease include family history 
of premature cardiovascular disease, familial hyper-
lipidaemia, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, 
and raised blood lipid levels as main risk factors173. 
Stress is acknowledged as a potential contributing  
factor 
to both development and progression of the disease, 
and a targeted rather than universal strategy for stress 
 
management is recommended.
More specifically, the guideline ranks the strength 
of evi 
dence and recommendations into four classes. 
Class I evidence (evidence and/or general agreement that 
a given treatment or procedure is beneficial, useful, and 
effective and “is recommended”) relates to risk factors 
such as hypertension and high serum cholesterol levels. 
The evidence on the status of stress as a cardiovascular 
disease risk factor is rated as class IIa, indicating that 
the weight of evidence is in favour of usefulness and/or 
efficacy and that addressing the risk factor “should be 
considered” (REF. 173). The guideline recommends assess-
ment and management of stress and other psychosocial 
factors (socioeconomic adversity, lack of social support, 
stress at work and in family life, hostility, depression, 
 
anxiety, and other mental disorders) in individuals at 
high risk of cardiovascular disease or with established 
cardiovascular disease, but not in the general population.
The Cardiac Rehabilitation Section of the Euro-
pean Association of Cardiovascular Prevention and 
Rehabilitation of the ESC additionally emphasizes that 
“the success of cardiac rehabilitation may critically 
depend on the interdependence of the body and mind 
and this interaction needs to be reflected through the 
assessment and management of psychosocial risk fac-
tors in line with robust scientific evidence, by trained 
staff, integrated within the core cardiac rehabilitation 
team” (p. 1290)168.
Other prevention guidelines provide either  
indirect 
recommendations in terms of stress prevention or state 
that insufficient evidence is available to provide a recom-
mendation. The Canadian 2016 guidelines, for exam-
ple, note that health-care providers can explore stress 
management techniques for patients with myocardial 
infarction and depression to optimize quality of life; the 
importance of moderate sleep duration is also empha-
sized174. By contrast, the most recent WHO report on 
cardiovascular disease management in primary health 
care, the AHA and ACC risk assessment tool, and the 
AHA/American Stroke Association secondary preven-
tion guideline do not list stress as a specific prevention 
target175–177. Nonetheless, most clinical guidelines make 
recommendations on the composition of a multidisci-
plinary cardiac rehabilitation team and acknowledge 
that core components should include initial assess-
ment, structured exercise training, nutrition counsel-
ling, patient education, risk factor management, and 
 
psychosocial support178.
Conclusions
Meta-analyses published during the past 5–10 years sug-
gest that stress in adulthood has a modest role in cardio-
vascular disease aetiology among healthy individuals 
compared with severe childhood stress or adult classic 
risk factors, such as hypertension, high serum choles-
terol levels, diabetes, smoking, and obesity. By contrast, 
adulthood stress might be an important disease trigger 
in susceptible persons and a determinant of prognosis 
and outcome in those with pre-existing cardiovascular 
or cere 
brovascular disease. Knowledge on the cardio-
vascular implications of stress pathophysiology, includ-
ing disturbance in autonomic, metabolic, inflammatory, 
and haemostatic processes, is accumulating and new 
discover 
ies involved the identification of functional 
changes in the central nervous system. Although the 
main emphasis in stress studies has traditionally been on 
cardiovascular disease aetiology, the emerging evidence 
is increasingly shifting weight into the role of stress in 
disease progression in individuals at high risk or with 
cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease.

 To complement research on disease causation and 
mechanisms, studies aimed at developing cost- 
effective, 
scalable stress interventions that can deliver substan-
tial health gains are needed; in other words, science 
of delivery. The first steps towards clinical application 
have already been made in the European guidelines by 
acknowledging stress as a contributing factor to cardio-
vascular disease. Precision medicine is an emerging 
approach in the medical sciences that seeks to pre-
dict more accurately which prevention and treatment 
strat 
egies for a disease will work in a specific group of 
individuals179. In the future, it is important to examine 
whether information on stress can contribute to pre-
cision medicine approaches by characterizing distinct 
groups of individuals in need of special attention or as 
part of  
targeted prevention and treatment strategies.
Although clinical guidelines have favoured, if any-
thing, targeted rather than universal strategies for stress 
prevention, this approach might need reconsideration 
when more evidence accumulates. Population-wide poli-
cies and strategies have been shown to be cost-effective 
in reducing classic risk factors, for example, smoking 
by means of clean indoor air legislation, cigarette price 
increases, and reductions in licences for tobacco out-
lets180–182. Modelling studies suggest that universal diet 
interventions, such as the UK sugar tax, might also bene-
fit public health183. Given the much higher  
numbers of 
people with stress in the general population than among 
individuals with advanced disease, the population- 
attributable risk (a measure of preventive potential) 
is broadly similar for heart disease in these groups at 
3–7% for chronic stressors in the general population and 
approximately 4% for stress triggers in high-risk individ-
uals9,48,62,126. These rates suggest there might be scope for 
multiple stress intervention strategies, including tar-
geted interventions for people with high overall risk of 
cardio 
vascular disease and a general plan for the general 
 
population; that is, a public health approach.
