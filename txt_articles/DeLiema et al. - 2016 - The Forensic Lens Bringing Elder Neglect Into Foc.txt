 were nonverbal with histories of dementia and end-stage disease. Their primary caregivers, adult 
children, were uncooperative with Adult Protective Services (APS) and disregarded treatment 
recommendations. Although both elders had signs suspicious of neglect, a comprehensive review 
revealed many layers of complexity. We use these cases to illustrate an approach to the assessment 
of possible elder neglect in ED settings and how to intervene to ensure patient safety. We begin 
with a discussion of the differences between willful, unintentional, and unsubstantiated neglect by 
a caregiver, and then describe when to suspect neglect by evaluating the elder, interviewing the 
caregiver and first responders, assessing the caregiver's ability to meet the elder's needs, and, if 
possible, obtaining past medical history and information about the home care environment. These 
cases illustrate the importance of careful documentation in cases of suspected neglect in order to 
assist investigative agencies, reduce the risk of further harm, and improve patient outcomes.

Introduction
Case 1
Responding to a 9-1-1 call from Adult Protective Services (APS), paramedics found Mr. K., 
age 73, clothed in only a T-shirt, lying in the fetal position in a dimly lit bedroom in the back 
of his home. Paramedics observed that he was emaciated, filthy and in pain. At the 
emergency department, Mr. K was awake but disoriented with generalized weakness, 
contractures, cachexia, hypoalbuminemia, and a BMI of 15.6, indicative of severe 
malnutrition. Records showed he had a history of Alzheimer's disease, alcoholism, tobacco 
use, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Early-stage pressure ulcers 
covered his left side. Test results for leukocytosis and hypercalcemia pointed to a finding 
that was confirmed by chest X-ray: a right lung mass measuring 12cm × 8.5cm was later 
determined to be non-small cell lung cancer and had metastasized to bone.
Mr. K's son lived in the home and was intoxicated when the paramedics arrived. He rejected 
recommendations for moving his father into a skilled nursing facility, insisting that his 
father's wishes were to live and die at home. Mr. K's inadequate dress, high pain level, 
malnutrition, multiple decubiti, and his caregiver's lack of response to the gravity of his 
condition were all red flags for elder neglect.
Case 2
Mr. M., age 85, with end-stage Parkinson's disease, was brought to the emergency 
department (ED) by his daughter who lived in his home. Mr. M was nonverbal but presented 
with significantly deteriorated health, impaired physical and cognitive function, and multiple 
decubiti ranging from Stage I to Stage III. Like Mr. K.'s son, Mr. M's daughter insisted that 
he be discharged back to her care and challenged the hospital's recommendation to place 
him in a skilled nursing facility. The physician believed that Mr. M required professional

 care and made a report to APS with suspicion of elder neglect. The same red flags were 
present: poor nutrition, contractures, multiple decubiti, and an uncooperative caregiver.
Elder Neglect—A seminal report by the National Research Council defined elder neglect 
as “failure by a caregiver to satisfy the elder's basic needs or protect the elder from harm.”1 
Examples include failure to ensure the elder's physical safety, failure to help with personal 
care, and/or failure to prevent malnutrition or dehydration.2 The American College of 
Emergency Physicians recommends that emergency personnel screen patients for elder 
mistreatment3 and laws mandate that healthcare providers report suspicions of neglect to 
APS in 49 states and the District of Columbia.4
Elder neglect can be difficult to diagnose. Symptoms are often confounded with end-of-life 
physiologic states,5 and, unlike other forms of elder mistreatment such as physical or sexual 
abuse, neglect stems from an omission of care as well as actions that inflict harm, like 
physical restraints and social isolation. As these two cases demonstrate, patients may be 
unable to report poor quality care due to cognitive impairment, advanced illness, or, 
ultimately, death.2 Others may deny mistreatment for fear of angering and/or losing their 
caregiver.6
There are important distinctions between willful neglect, unintentional neglect, and sub-
acute symptoms caused by an underlying illness that manifest as neglect in spite of a 
caregiver's best efforts. Examples of willful neglect are intentionally denying food, water, 
and medication, use of physical restraints, or isolating the elder thereby withholding 
emotional stimulation and social interaction.7 Some caregivers have underlying motives like 
financial compensation, free housing, desire for power and control, and retaliation for 
dementia-related problem behaviors by the elder.8 Other caregivers may have mental illness9 
or substance abuse disorders.
Conversely, unintentional neglect occurs when a caregiver lacks the necessary resources, 
strength, psychological stability, maturity, or skills to meet the elder's needs.7 Physical or 
cognitive impairments, inadequate training (e.g., wound care, administering injections), 
mistrust of the health care system, and limited support can also compromise care. In other 
situations, elders present with advanced geriatric conditions that are difficult to manage even 
by skilled professionals, including extreme frailty, loss of skin integrity, weight loss, and 
poor mental functioning. Even with optimal care, physiological states may develop in dying 
persons that are not caused by willful or unintentional neglect.10
This complexity, coupled with lack of training in identifying mistreatment,11-14 make it 
especially difficult for ED personnel to identify neglect although they are often the first 
healthcare providers to interact with victims and caregivers. Victims often receive low levels 
of social support and infrequent primary care,15 which are risk factors for ED use,16 and 
some frail elders arrive to the ED by ambulance due to caregiver inability to transport them. 
Emergency physicians may feel trapped between doing too little—failing to identify neglect, 
not reporting, and increasing risk of further harm—and doing too much—accusing a 
caregiver of neglect, eroding trust, and inhibiting caregivers from providing care consistent 
with the patient's preferences.17,18 Given the aging of the population, emergency physicians

 need to be prepared to balance their obligations to the patient by documenting findings, 
reporting suspicions, and referring to appropriate agencies.
The Forensic Lens
The “forensic lens”19 involves using medical expertise to answer questions pertaining to 
criminal justice and the law. The forensic lens is intended to help investigators evaluate the 
entire clinical, social, and legal scenario when determining the cause of elder mistreatment. 
Objective documentation of the signs of neglect is helpful to neglect investigators who may 
subpoena health records if the case is referred for prosecution. While emergency providers 
are unlikely to be involved in the entire investigation process, viewing patients and their 
medical presentations through a forensic lens will help providers assess the possibility of 
neglect and improve patient outcomes.
Evaluating the Elder
All older patients presenting to the ED with signs suspicious of neglect should be 
interviewed privately at some point during the evaluation. If the patient is unable to answer 
questions, like Mr. K and Mr. M, individuals who have knowledge of the patient (caregivers, 
family members, home care workers, primary care physician) may be able to provide 
information. We recommend starting with general questions about care at home followed by 
more specific questions regarding neglect.20
Observation of a patient's behavior is critically important at the ED encounter, particularly 
when the patient cannot communicate. If the patient is alert, nonverbal clues such as changes 
in demeanor or guarded body language in the presence of the caregiver could indicate fear 
and anxiety. The physician should note general appearance (cleanliness, hygiene, dress) and 
state of nutrition and hydration. Specific attention should be paid to dental hygiene, 
contractures, decubiti, bruises, untreated injuries, and elongated toenails.20 Whenever 
possible, the provider should take photographs of pressure ulcers and other injuries, and 
document their locations, color, and size on a body map (a drawing of the injuries on a body 
diagram). Severe weight loss and pressure ulcers may be signs of neglect, but can also be 
markers of end-stage disease. The context in which they develop is important.
Some laboratory findings can be useful in determining whether neglect has occurred. 
Hypernatremia (Na > 145), elevated BUN/Creatinine ratio (>20), and elevated hemoglobin/
hematocrit suggest dehydration. Other markers of malnutrition are anemia, low serum 
albumin (<3.5 g/dL), low prealbumin, and low lymphocyte count (<1500/mm).21 Toxicology 
panels can show inappropriate use of chemical restraints and overuse/underuse of 
medications.
Evaluating the Caregiver
Caregivers should be interviewed separately from the patient using a nonjudgmental and 
person-centered approach.20 Questions should focus on the patient's medical conditions, 
daily care needs, medications and assistance provided. The caregiver's mental/physical 
health and access to support resources (other family caregivers, in-home care, financial 
resources, transportation) is important. The physician can look for inconsistencies between

 the elder's condition and the caregiver's narrative, and assess the caregiver's attitude toward 
the elder. Questions should elucidate gaps in the caregiver's understanding of the elder's 
condition and the extent to which their cultural or religious beliefs, as well as personal 
coping styles, influenced care choices.
Neglect may occur when caregivers can't perform the tasks they claim to do, such as helping 
administer medications and preparing regular meals. By actively involving caregivers in the 
history and medical evaluation of the patient, emergency physicians can observe how 
caregiving duties are performed and whether additional training could help. For example, the 
physician could ask Mr. K's and Mr. M's caregivers, “I understand that your father has some 
pressure ulcers. Can we take a look at them together?” By focusing on the patient's health, 
the physician can avoid questions that could be construed as condescending or accusatory. 
Rather, questions should be task-based: “How often do you change these dressings? Can you 
show me how you do it?
Obtaining Collateral Information
Although not always readily accessible, when available, health records may provide 
important clues about the caregiver's commitment to the elder, and patterns such as missed 
appointments, delay in seeking treatment, and medication noncompliance. Records can also 
show previous hospitalizations, diagnoses, trajectory of cognitive and physical impairment, 
failure to follow through with a physician's recommendations, and previous signs/reports of 
neglect. If available, chart notes from social services agencies and visiting home care 
workers also offer insights. Busy ED physicians do not typically have patients' medical 
records on hand, but federal initiatives to develop a nationwide health information network 
may eventually make them easier to access.22,23
ED personnel should attempt to contact the patient's primary care physician to determine 
when the elder was last evaluated, for how long s/he has been a patient, and to ask about the 
caregiver's competency. If the patient has no primary care physician, ED personnel should be 
attentive to any other signs that the elder is not getting proper care. Emergency responders 
may also have information about the home environment and the caregiver. If the patient was 
accompanied to the ED by APS or law enforcement, their observations should be noted 
along with their motivation for seeking emergency services for the patient. If they are 
involved, hospice workers, personal care aides, occupational therapists, and other friends/
family members can also be contacted for information.
Revisiting Mr. K and Mr. M
Based on the medical examinations, caregiver interviews, and health records, Mr. K and Mr. 
M were both reported to APS for neglect. APS brought these cases to an elder abuse forensic 
center for review. The forensic center is a multidisciplinary team that brings together APS, 
law enforcement, district attorneys, public guardians, health professionals, and forensic 
neuropsychologists.24 This team used a systematic approach to differentiate between willful 
neglect, passive neglect, and end-of-life physiologic states not caused by neglect 
(unsubstantiated neglect).
DeLiema et al.

 Health records offered key details in both cases. They showed that Mr. M developed the 
decubiti during a temporary stay at a skilled nursing facility, which left his daughter with a 
strong prejudice against nursing homes and a general suspicion of the medical system. 
Although a caregiver's failure to seek medical treatment is one form of elder neglect,2 it 
became apparent that she sought hospital care for her father in emergency situations, but 
once his condition stabilized, she believed she could provide better care at home. She was 
able to demonstrate how she rotated her father to relieve pressure, changed his dressings, and 
administered medication, proving she routinely did these tasks. Records showed that a home 
care agency had come weekly until Mr. M's condition became so severe that they refused to 
accept liability for his care. Mr. M's daughter admitted that she had promised to care for him 
until his death but had difficulty accepting his prognosis.
In comparison, Mr. K had not seen a doctor in several years and was not receiving any 
medications or in-home services. Three years prior to the APS report, a chest computerized 
tomography scan detected a 9mm mass in the upper lobe of his right lung, suspicious for 
malignancy. Records stated Mr. K was “lost to follow-up” after he missed a subsequent 
oncology appointment and medications were not refilled. When the APS worker asked Mr. 
K's son why he did not take him to see a doctor or administer medications, he replied, “He 
doesn't need to see a doctor or take medicine because he is dying.” The son's indifference 
toward seeking treatment contributed to Mr. K's pain and may have hastened death. Later 
investigations by the forensic center revealed that the son was compensated through the 
state's In-Home Supportive Services program and was the representative payee for Mr. Ks' 
social security benefits. By keeping Mr. K at home, the son received these benefits and 
avoided paying for professional care.
These two cases share a number of similar features: Mr. K and Mr. M. were fully dependent 
on their cohabitating adult children, both were experiencing the end stage of debilitating 
illnesses and were nonverbal, and both caregivers claimed that the elders' final wishes were 
to die at home. Despite these similarities, the forensic center arrived at different conclusions 
about which caregiver intentionally neglected the patient and how to address each situation, 
underscoring the importance of carefully documenting the entire clinical scenario in the ED.
Pulling Back the Curtain: A Visit to the Home
In forensic center investigations, team members may recommend a home visit to evaluate 
the elder and assess the appropriateness of the care setting. Although emergency physicians 
typically do not examine patients in their homes, first responders—APS, paramedics, and 
law enforcement—may be able to provide information about safety issues and potential 
hazards such as extreme temperatures, lack of water or electricity, weapons, aggressive pets, 
or caregivers or other residents with mental illness or substance abuse problems.25 For 
example, Mr. K's son was intoxicated the morning paramedics were called, and Mr. M's 
daughter screamed at investigators to leave, requiring them to involve the police.
When inside the home, emergency responders should note the following: Where is the elder 
in relation to other residents? How do the elder's living conditions compare to other parts of 
the household? Mr. K's back bedroom was sparsely furnished and unclean, discordant with 
the elegantly remodeled area where his son resided. He was lying exposed on a filthy 
DeLiema et al.

 mattress, a half-empty glass of a nutritional supplement collected dust and fruit flies on his 
bedside table, and medications were untouched. Although Mr. M's home was mildly 
cluttered, his bedroom was the center of activity. It was furnished with a hospital bed and air 
mattress to prevent decubiti, a lift to transport him to a wheelchair, an IV pole to administer 
fluids, and a supply of gauze pads.
To augment any information that first responders can provide, physicians should ask the 
caregiver about what medical equipment is used, if any, and how the elder's needs are met 
when the caregiver is away. Other considerations include whether food, medications, and 
assistive devices are within easy reach, whether the elder has access to clean water and an 
appropriate place to sleep and eat.
In a busy emergency department setting, an ED physician may not have the time to gather all 
of this information. If they have concerns that the home is not safe, especially if it appears 
that the elder will not be admitted or will be taken AMA, physicians can ask the ED or 
hospital social worker to contact local agencies and/or community partners to conduct 
welfare checks and home assessments26 and assist in disposition planning.
Reporting
ED providers are not responsible for determining the cause of neglect, but if they have 
suspicions, and particularly if further harm is possible, they should contact APS immediately 
in compliance with mandatory reporting laws and emergency department protocol.27,28 If 
there is imminent concern for safety, law enforcement should also be contacted right away.
After receiving a report, APS investigates the allegations and may cross-report to law 
enforcement. An investigation typically involves meeting face-to-face with the elder to 
conduct a needs assessment and safety check. APS cannot share details about ongoing 
investigations, but can share their concerns with the ED physician if they called for 
emergency services. This information can help inform the disposition decision.
Achieving a Safe Disposition
Emergency medical care is the first priority when neglect is suspected, but situational 
assessment, reporting suspicions, long-term planning, and preventing further risk are also 
essential. Proper use of the diagnostic code for Adult Maltreatment (unspecified) can be 
useful in ensuring care (ICD10: suspected T76.91, confirmed T74.91). If there is immediate 
danger, contact between the patient and caregiver must be prevented. Hospitalization is one 
option, however if there is no medical need for hospitalization, safe placement in another 
care facility is advisable.
Elder abuse interventions differ from child abuse interventions because ED physicians must 
respect the autonomy of mentally competent adults. If the patient refuses intervention, the 
ED physician must determine if the elder has the capacity to make decisions. In questionable 
cases, a psychiatric consultation may be helpful. If the elder lacks capacity, APS, hospital 
social workers, and the medical team can consider a court ordered guardianship. If the 
caregiver attempts to take the patient home against medical advice, the ED physician should 
DeLiema et al.

 determine if the caregiver has a valid power of attorney. Several other options can be 
considered: medical hold, admission for safety (under alias with restricted visits), risk 
management, and ethics consultation. An elder who has capacity has the right to refuse 
intervention, but should be educated about risk and resources. In either case, a report should 
be made to APS.
When there is less concern for danger, but signs of neglect are present, interventions can be 
more individualized. If the elder can be safely discharged home, a follow-up plan should be 
developed with the primary care physician. A hospital social worker can help coordinate 
community services to assist a well-intentioned caregiver to provide better care. Options 
include: referral for Medicare, in-home services, Meals on Wheels, transportation services, 
adult day care, and hospice care.
Outcomes
Mr. K's and Mr. M's cases demonstrate the complexity of elder neglect and how two cases 
with similar features in the initial assessment have different underlying dynamics that lead to 
different interventions. If the case is referred for prosecution there must be clear evidence of 
criminal negligence, like the behavior demonstrated by Mr. K's son. This means that the 
caregiver acted in a reckless way that created a high risk of death or great bodily injury, and 
he knew that acting that way would create such a risk.29 In contrast, if the caregiver did not 
understand the elder's prognosis and needs for end-of-life care, as with Mr. M, the goal of 
APS and physicians is to support the caregiver through referrals to community-based 
services.30
In Mr. K's case, law enforcement conducted an investigation and the forensic center 
geriatrician reviewed all medical records to produce a report documenting the signs of 
neglect. To ensure that Mr. K was safe, APS involved his daughter who lived out-of-state. 
She hired a hospice agency to manage Mr. K's care until he passed away. Although the case 
was filed for prosecution, Mr. K's son was never indicted as is typical of most elder neglect 
cases. Actions which might have made indictment possible would be bringing in law 
enforcement as early as possible, more detailed documentation by medical providers on the 
elder's medical condition and its evolution over time, and systematic examination of the 
caregiver's attentiveness and approach.
In Mr. M's case, when the forensic center geriatrician conducted a home evaluation, it 
became apparent that his daughter desperately wanted to care for him at home and stated 
that this was Mr. M's preference as well. After a lengthy family meeting, APS, law 
enforcement, and the geriatrician helped her understand her father's prognosis and validated 
her desire to care for him. A hospice agency was found and she was referred to respite and 
counseling services. This case was not further investigated by law enforcement.
Conclusion
Using the forensic lens approach that focuses on both the elder and the caregiver, physicians 
can gather important information that could allow later investigation to differentiate 
negligent care from situations involving overwhelmed caregivers and/or conditions related to

 end-of-life. Ultimately, the definitive determination of whether a patient is being neglected is 
the responsibility of APS and the criminal justice system. The emergency physician's 
responsibilities are to initiate the investigation by reporting to APS and law enforcement (if 
required), provide detailed documentation, and ensure the patient's safety. Emergency 
physicians can also help prevent misunderstandings about elder neglect by encouraging 
patients to document care preferences, involve others in care planning, and communicate 
with their caregivers about how to fulfill their wishes.
