ABSTRACT
Reducing the number of preterm births is a high public health
priority in the U.S. Preterm birth, affecting an estimated 380,000
infants annually, is a leading cause of infant mortality and
morbidity
and
is
associated
with
individual
and
systemic
characteristics. Preterm birth is estimated to cost society $26
billion annually. Despite an elevated financial burden caused by
preterm birth, very little is known about who bears these costs.
This study seeks to understand the relationship between Medicaid
and private insurance payment for preterm birth, using multiple
years of vital statistics data, which for the first time since 2010
include information on payment source. The nationwide data
cover births that occur in all settings, including non-hospital
settings, and many maternal characteristics not available in other
datasets, improving upon previous analyses. These data can be
used to promote better Medicaid coverage of interventions
known to be effective in reducing preterm births.

Introduction
Preterm birth represents a significant public health problem, affecting close to 380,000
infants (1 in 10 infants born in the U.S.) in 2014 (Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion 2015). Preterm births are a leading cause of infant mortality and morbidity, imposing
a societal burden estimated at $26 billion annually (Behrman and Butler 2007). However,
despite an elevated financial burden caused by preterm birth, very little is known about
who bears these costs. In this article, we provide up-to-date data on Medicaid coverage
and preterm birth since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), in 2010, which
coincides with the first time that the public use file for national birth certificate data
included information on source of insurance coverage.
Some of the causes of preterm births have been well established. They include socioe-
conomic and sociodemographic characteristics of the mother as well as behavioral,

 psychosocial, and health risks that affect women during their pregnancy. Socioeconomic and
sociodemographic maternal factors empirically associated with preterm births include age
(young or old maternal age), income (low income), education (less than a high school
degree), marital status (unmarried), neighborhood (urban), and race/ethnicity (nonwhite)
(Behrman and Butler 2007). Maternal behavioral, psychosocial, and health risks proven to
contribute to preterm births include smoking; consuming alcohol; using illicit drugs; suffer-
ing from anxiety and/or depression; or lacking social supports (Behrman and Butler 2007).
System-level factors have also been demonstrated to influence preterm birth and
include adequate prenatal care measured from the month care begins, total number of pre-
natal care visits, and early diagnosis, treatment, and management of maternal chronic con-
ditions, including diabetes, hypertension, and preeclampsia (Behrman and Butler 2007).
Health insurance coverage is another important system-level factor associated with
increased utilization of prenatal services and medical management of maternal conditions,
which in turn are associated with improved health outcomes for mother and child.
The two main sources of health insurance coverage for maternity care are private health
insurance and publicly funded state Medicaid programs (Markus and Rosenbaum 2010).
As of 2011, one year after ACA’s passage, private insurance and public (mostly Medicaid)
insurance each covered almost 50% of all births (Kowlessar, Jiang, and Steiner 2013;
Markus et al. 2013).
In general, pregnant women access private health insurance through their own or their
spouses’ employers, through the individual market, or, since 2014, through insurance mar-
ketplaces. They can also access Medicaid coverage in several different ways if they meet
income eligibility requirements.
Low-income pregnant women who are undocumented, or legally present in the U.S.
and subject to a five-year ban on Medicaid eligibility, are eligible for emergency Medicaid
coverage limited to labor and delivery services (MACPAC 2014). For most other low-
income pregnant women, Medicaid benefits are limited to the duration of pregnancy
and 60 days postpartum (with some variation by state), but coverage is otherwise broad
in terms of pregnancy-related services because the Medicaid medical necessity standard
focuses on the health of the mother and unborn child (MACPAC 2014). However, preg-
nant women must pay out of pocket for any services that are not deemed to be pregnancy
related (MACPAC 2014).
Coverage rules in the private sector differ from those in Medicaid, and benefits are
typically less generous than Medicaid due to a more restrictive medical necessity stan-
dard. Before the enactment of ACA, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) of
1978, which amends Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, required ‘employers
who offer health insurance to include coverage of pregnancy, childbirth, and related
medical conditions’, but mandatory coverage of maternity care benefits was limited in
the private sector to businesses that had more than 15 employees and offered health
insurance to those employees (U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
2015). Otherwise, prior to ACA, maternity care was often outright excluded in the indi-
vidual market and varied greatly in the small-group market. Fewer than half of states
required small-group policies to include maternity care, and in states without mandates,
employers with fewer than 15 employees were exempt from providing maternity cover-
age by virtue of the PDA provisions. With the implementation of ACA, individual and
small-group policies offered in the insurance marketplaces must cover maternity care as
80

 one of 10 essential health benefits. The specific content of the maternity care benefit is
determined by a benchmark equivalency standard. ACA provides for a federal process to
update the benefit package in cases of controversial treatments, which over time should
make the benefits more explicit and specific. Additionally, ACA requires all insurers in
the marketplaces and most other health plans to pay for preventive care (another 1 of
the 10 essential health benefits) without cost sharing, as long as the specific services
or procedures that fall under the preventive care benefit category have reached an A
or B recommendation from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Several preg-
nancy-related services have reached that level and are now mandated for all pregnant
or lactating women without cost sharing as part of the preventive benefit unless other-
wise specified (U.S. DHHS HealthCare.gov 2015). These services include tobacco and
alcohol counseling, and gestational diabetes screenings, as well as a number of other
screens (U.S. DHHS HealthCare.gov 2015).
Expansion of coverage to more women with broader coverage of evidenced-based
benefits, such as preventive and maternity care, has the potential to improve health out-
comes for women and their infants. Improved access has the potential to improve
women’s health prior to, and during, pregnancy, so that women will experience healthier
pregnancies and, consequently, fewer preterm births and will give birth to fewer infants
with low birthweight or other poor developmental and health outcomes. Currently, little
is known about the burden of preterm birth by payer source, especially by the clinically
defined gestational stages of very/moderately preterm, late preterm, early term, and full
term. Two studies published in the scientific literature in the last 10 years, both national
in scope, focus on preterm birth and the cost of hospitalization attributable to preterm
birth (Russell et al. 2007; Fowler et al. 2014). Both used hospital discharge data from the
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS).
Russell et al. (2007) analyzed one year of data for 2001 and applied simple bivariate stat-
istics; none of the authors’ analyses controlled for covariates known to influence preterm
birth and related costs. Fowler et al. (2014) analyzed multiple years of data from 2002 to
2009 and used multiple logistic regression, which included a limited set of covariates as
available in HCUP NIS (Fowler et al. 2014). Both studies found that the average cost
per complicated delivery was roughly the same for Medicaid and private insurance:
$15,800 for Medicaid vs. $15,000 for private insurance in 2001 (p = .58) (Russell et al.
2007); $14,888 for Medicaid vs. $12,065 for private insurance in 2009 (Fowler et al.
2014). Neither study examined specific gestational stages, and in both studies, key maternal
factors that have been associated with preterm births were not included, such as maternal
age, race/ethnicity, education level, smoking status, pregnancy and birth history, and
type of delivery, which the HCUP NIS does not contain. The National Vital Statistics
Birth Data include these maternal sociodemographic variables but do not include infor-
mation about payment source until 2010. In addition, the data with payment information
did not become publicly available for further analysis until early 2014.
The first objective of our study was to evaluate the association between Medicaid cover-
age and the risk of preterm births, including very/moderately and late preterm births (i.e.
<34 weeks and between 34–36 weeks of gestation, respectively), compared with that
between private insurance coverage and preterm birth risk, using newly available natality
public use data files of all births (National Vital Statistics Birth Data) in years 2010–2013
with payment information. Our second objective was to identify risk factors among
JOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND POVERTY
81
 women whose labor and delivery were covered by Medicaid, which may be associated with
these preterm outcomes. The opportunity to improve services by focusing on preterm
births is particularly relevant to the Medicaid program, since roughly half of all Medicaid
hospital stays are for childbirth, the proportion of complicated births billed to Medicaid
has increased over the past decade, and complicated births covered by Medicaid are
more likely due to preterm birth/low birthweight and respiratory distress than other
causes (Fowler et al. 2014).
Methods
Outcome measures
Our study focused on preterm births (gestational age <37 weeks) compared with full-term
births by source of insurance coverage (private insurance, Medicaid, self-pay, or other).
We also examined births stratified by the following gestational stages: early preterm or
very/moderately preterm (fewer than 34 weeks), late preterm (34 through 36 weeks),
early term (37 through 38 weeks), and full term (39 weeks or more). Preterm birth was
defined using the best obstetric estimate of completed weeks of gestation available on
the newborn section of the birth certificate.
General approach
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using 2010–2013 National Vital Statistics
Birth Data from the National Center for Health Statistics (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention). The annual birth cohort files contain information on approxi-
mately four million annual live births in the U.S. and are considered to be as close to a
census as possible. As stated previously, only since 2010 has the public use file for
national birth data included a payment source variable, and the data with payment
information did not become publicly available for further analysis until early 2014.
Information is obtained from the 2003 revised birth certificate, which has been
adopted by most states. For this study, we limited the dataset for each year of data to
all states that reported payment source information. We analyzed the association
between Medicaid coverage (exposure) and preterm birth (outcome), using private insur-
ance coverage as a nonequivalent comparison, in each of the four years of data in which
payment source was available as well as in a pooled dataset, because reporting from states
was lower in 2010 than in 2013. We controlled for other known factors available in the
dataset. Covariates included maternal age, race, ethnicity, education, marital status, pre-
pregnancy BMI, cigarette smoking, infertility treatment, interval between pregnancies,
number of prior births, prior preterm birth, prenatal care, method of delivery, gestational
diabetes, hypertension, and eclampsia. Our hypothesis was that Medicaid covered a dis-
proportionate number of preterm births compared with private insurance, controlling for
known influencing factors. Our second main hypothesis was that women with Medicaid-
covered preterm births shared some mutable (amenable to change) and immutable
characteristics that were different from those of women who had experienced privately
insured preterm births and those who had experienced Medicaid-covered term births.
The George Washington University Institutional Review Board deemed this study exempt.

 Study cohorts
We studied births in all states that have adopted the 2003-revised birth certificate, repre-
senting 3,516,974 births in 2013 (88.9% of all births), 3,444,925 births in 2012 (87.2% of all
births), 3,336,100 births in 2011 (84.4% of all births), and 3,030,147 births in 2010 (75.8%
of all births). Table 1 lists states included in the analyses by year.
Statistical analyses
We conducted our analysis in four steps. First, we summarized descriptive statistics on the
characteristics of the birth cohort stratified by insurance status, including Medicaid and
private insurance coverage. Second, we analyzed the data for each year of data available

 between 2010 and 2013 to determine whether there was any detectable trend in the rate of
preterm birth over that four-year period.
Third, we examined the relationship between Medicaid coverage and outcomes, using
bivariate statistics (chi-square) and multivariate logistic regression models controlling for
confounders available in the dataset to estimate risk of preterm birth for Medicaid-covered
births relative to privately insured births. We applied these analyses to each individual year
as well as a pooled 2010–2013 sample.
Fourth, we restricted the analysis to Medicaid-covered women to identify predictors of
preterm births among Medicaid-covered women. We limited our analysis to the 2013
sample, as no clear patterns were detectable from year to year over the four periods of
data available for analysis.
All analyses were conducted using STATA v. 13.1 software (StataCorp. 2013).
Results
Preterm birth by payment source
Comparison of Medicaid vs. private coverage of preterm birth: bivariate results
Distribution of Medicaid vs. private coverage of all births and preterm births in general and
over time. Overall, private insurance covered a higher proportion of all births in 2013 –
47.3% compared with 43.5% of Medicaid births covered that year. Of the 3,516,974
births in 2013 meeting our inclusion criteria, i.e. for which we had payment source infor-
mation (88.9% of all births in the dataset), 397,417 were preterm, representing 11.3% of all
live births with payer source data in 2013. Among all preterm births, Medicaid covered a
higher percentage of births than private insurance, at 48.9% vs. 42.3%, and a higher per-
centage of births covered by Medicaid were preterm than was true of private insurance
(12.7% vs. 10.9%). Similar results were observed in 2010, 2011, and 2012. In 2010,
2011, and 2012, Medicaid and private insurance, respectively, covered 48.9% vs. 41.7%,
48.9% vs. 42.1%, and 48.5% vs. 42.4% of all preterm births (Figure 1). Results from our
pooled 2010–2013 data analysis remained consistent with reported year-by-year findings.
In this pooled data set, Medicaid and private insurance, respectively, covered 48.8% and
42.1% of all preterm births. All results comparing Medicaid and private insurance were
statistically significant at the p < .001 level.

 Distribution of Medicaid vs. private coverage of preterm birth by gestational stages. When
examining the distribution of Medicaid-covered births vs. privately covered births by gesta-
tional stages, we found that Medicaid – compared with private insurance – covered a higher
percentage of all very/moderately preterm births (50.3% vs. 40.6%) and all late preterm
births (48.3% vs. 43.0%) but not early-term births (45.1% vs. 45.9%) in 2013 (Figure 2).
All of these differences were statistically significant at the p < .001 level, although the differ-
ence was small and not clinically meaningful for the early-term group.
Comparison of Medicaid vs. private coverage of preterm birth: multivariate results
Table 2 presents the results of our adjusted analysis with respect to our main outcomes.
Compared with private insurance and controlling for other relevant covariates, we found
that in 2013, Medicaid was 7.5% more likely to be the payer source for a preterm birth
than for a full-term birth. All covariates included in the model were also significantly associ-
ated with preterm births at the p < .001 level, with higher rates of preterm birth associated
with the sociodemographic and maternal health risk factors highlighted in Table 3.
Maternal risks associated with preterm birth
Comparison of maternal characteristics of women with a Medicaid vs. privately
covered preterm birth
Table 3 summarizes the prevalence of sociodemographic characteristics and health risks of
women who had Medicaid-covered preterm births and women who had privately covered
preterm births. Compared with women who had experienced privately covered preterm
births, women who had experienced Medicaid-covered preterm births were more likely
to be young (age 12–19), unmarried, black or Hispanic, underweight, and in the habit
of smoking cigarettes. They were also more likely to have less than a high school
degree, to have foregone any prenatal care, to have had a prior preterm birth, and to
have experienced too short a pregnancy interval between births. In contrast, women

 who had gone through privately covered preterm births were more likely than women who
had experienced Medicaid-covered preterm births to be white or otherwise of a race other
than black, to have a diagnosis of diabetes, to have eclampsia, and to have undergone a
cesarean delivery or infertility treatment.
More specifically, in 2013, 4% of all women covered by Medicaid who had preterm
births had no prenatal care, compared with 1.2% of all privately insured women with
preterm births; 5.2% of all Medicaid-covered women who had preterm births were under-
weight, compared with 3.3% of all women with private insurance who had preterm births;
7.8% of all women covered by Medicaid who had preterm births had had previous preterm
births, compared with 5.9% of all privately insured women; 21.2% of all Medicaid-covered
women who had preterm births had had a short pregnancy interval, compared with 13.6%
of all privately insured women; and 16.5% of all women with Medicaid who had preterm
births smoked cigarettes, compared with 4.6% of all women with private coverage. In con-
trast, having eclampsia, diabetes, a C-section, and infertility treatment was more prevalent
among privately insured women who had preterm births than among Medicaid-covered
women who had done so. For example, 8.5% of all women with private insurance who
had preterm births used infertility treatment, compared with 0.4% of all women with Med-
icaid who had preterm births. All of these differences were significant at p < .001.

 very/moderately preterm, late preterm, early term, and full term), and ran one model com-
paring very/moderately and late preterm with early and full term to reflect pre/post 37
weeks of gestation. In 2013, 61.6% of Medicaid births (n = 941,513) were full term,
25.7% (n = 393,654) were early term, 8.8% (n = 134,859) were late preterm, and 3.9% (n
= 59,365) were very/moderately preterm. Table 4 displays the results from the sample
restricted to Medicaid. When we move from the general sample (with payment infor-
mation) to the Medicaid sample (very/moderately + late preterm vs. early + full term),
all of the same factors remain statistically significant and in the expected direction. In
this Medicaid sample, women who had preterm births were 51% more likely to have a
short interpregnancy interval, 287% more likely to have had a prior preterm birth,
388% more likely to have eclampsia, 221% more likely to have no prenatal care, and
62% more likely to have a C-section than women who had term births.
Discussion and implications
To our knowledge, this analysis is the first since passage of ACA to provide up-to-date data
on the burden of preterm birth for Medicaid by comparing with private insurance; it is also

 the first to provide data on the characteristics of women who had Medicaid-covered
preterm births vs. women who had Medicaid-covered term births.
This analysis confirmed our main hypothesis that compared with private insurance,
Medicaid disproportionately covers preterm births, a statistically significant difference
that holds over time. This finding persisted when we controlled for relevant risk factors
that are known to contribute to preterm birth. Thus, during our study period, a birth
was more likely to be preterm if it was to a mother covered by Medicaid rather than to
a mother covered by private insurance, even when controlling for relevant covariates
that contribute to preterm births.
Among all preterm births, Medicaid also covers more very/moderately preterm and late
preterm births, which carry the highest risk for mother and infant as well as imposing the
greatest costs (Behrman and Butler 2007). The higher proportion of preterm births
covered by Medicaid has significant implications for the program and the financial
burden it must bear.
Preterm births impose a societal burden of more than $26 billion every year in lost
household and labor market productivity, maternal hospital stay for delivery, special edu-
cation services, early intervention services, and medical care services (Behrman and Butler
2007). Medicaid covers a higher number and percentage of preterm births than private
insurance. Therefore, a disproportionate share of this burden is funded by Medicaid.
However, this analysis does not reveal how this burden translates into total costs,
especially in comparison with total costs borne by private insurers. Given that some esti-
mates show that the average payment by commercial payers for maternal and newborn
care may be as high as twice the average payment by Medicaid (March of Dimes 2008;
Santoro and Rudolph 2014; Truven Health Analytics 2013), overall Medicaid costs
could be similar to private insurers’ costs despite a higher proportion of preterm birth.
Nevertheless, given an average cost of $21,500 per hospital stay per preterm birth in
2011 and a total of 189,358 Medicaid-covered preterm births in 2011, this could represent
upwards of $4 billion in total costs for the program that could be averted, at least in part.
This analysis also confirmed our second hypothesis – that women who have Medicaid-
covered preterm births differ in some respects from women who have privately insured
preterm births. Unique characteristics of the Medicaid population could provide insight
into risk factors for higher rates of preterm birth. Several maternal characteristics and
risk factors were found to be significantly associated with preterm birth, as was expected
from the literature, including age (Anum, Retchin and Strauss 2010; Feijen-de Jong et al.
2011; Goldenberg et al. 2008), BMI (Gould et al. 2014), eclampsia and hypertension
(Behrman and Butler 2007), gestational diabetes (Behrman and Butler 2007), education
(Anum, Retchin and Strauss 2010; Feijen-de Jong et al. 2011; Goldenberg et al. 2008),

(Behrman and Butler 2007; Conde-Agudelo, Rosas-Bermudex, and Kafury-Goeta 2006),
marital status (Feijen-de Jong et al. 2011; Shah, Zao, and Ali 2011), prenatal care
(Anum, Retchin and Strauss 2010; Feijen-de Jong et al. 2011), prior preterm birth (Gold-
enberg et al. 2008), race (Anum, Retchin and Strauss 2010; Feijen-de Jong et al. 2011;
Goldenberg et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2013), and tobacco use (Anum, Retchin and
Strauss 2010; Goldenberg et al. 2008). Many of these contributory factors are more preva-
lent in Medicaid-covered women than in women with private insurance coverage. Our
analysis showed that a much higher proportion of Medicaid-covered women than of
JOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND POVERTY
89
 privately insured women had characteristics associated with higher risk for preterm birth,
including younger age, unmarried status, education less than a high school degree, and
being black or of Hispanic ethnicity. These characteristics are shared within the low-
income Medicaid population in general. In addition, Medicaid-covered women with
early and late preterm births were more likely to have a short spacing between pregnan-
cies, receive late prenatal care or no prenatal care at all, be underweight, smoke cigarettes
during pregnancy, and experience a previous preterm birth than were privately insured
women. Privately insured women, on the other hand, were more likely to deliver via C-
section and use infertility treatments.
Among all women who had Medicaid-covered births, women with Medicaid-covered
very/moderately and late preterm births (<37 weeks gestation) were more likely than
women with Medicaid-covered early and full-term births (>37 weeks gestation) to lack
any prenatal care, have diabetes and eclampsia, deliver by C-section, have too short a preg-
nancy interval, be underweight, use infertility treatment, have prior preterm births, and
smoke cigarettes, indicating differences within the Medicaid program between women
who have and do not have preterm births.
Although further research is needed to understand the associations between maternal
risk factors and Medicaid-covered preterm births, our analysis would indicate that inter-
ventions, such as tobacco cessation, early entry into prenatal care, and promoting adequate
birth spacing could present significant opportunities for Medicaid programs to improve
birth outcomes and reduce program costs. Additionally, ACA provides new opportunities
for more effective implementation of interventions for low-income women of reproduc-
tive age through provisions that aim to improve seamless coverage and increase access
to insurance coverage via an expansion of Medicaid eligibility coupled with premium sub-
sidies and cost-sharing assistance in the new marketplaces. Between the summer of 2013
(prior to ACA implementation) and the winter of 2014–2015 (after one year of enroll-
ment), 5.5 million women of childbearing age gained coverage even before any plans of
becoming pregnant, reducing the uninsurance rate for this group from 19.6% to 13.3%
(ASPE 2015; Shartzer et al. 2015). Despite efforts to make coverage more seamless, we
expect pregnant women to move in and out of coverage options both within a given
state Medicaid program and between a state Medicaid program and the state’s market-
place due to fluctuations in income and changes in pregnancy status.
The fluctuation between insurance coverage options makes the changes to the benefits
available to pregnant women under ACA all the more important. The 2010 reforms
strengthen the availability and comprehensiveness of maternity care services and preven-
tive, pregnancy-related services for a higher number of women whether they are publicly
or privately insured. The exact content of the maternity care and preventive care benefits
continues to develop, as insurers make decisions about the medical necessity of specific
procedures in individual instances of need. Nevertheless, because these benefits are man-
dated on a wide scale for most pregnant women, opportunities to better manage pregnan-
cies for healthier birth outcomes and potentially lower costs abound.
Strengths and limitations
One strength of this study is that it uses vital statistics data to capture all births regardless
of delivery setting (Martin et al. 2015). This analysis found that 11.3% of all live births with
90
A.R. MARKUS ET AL.
 payer data source were preterm in 2013 and 11.6% were preterm in 2011. This is a higher
estimate than those produced by prior analyses of 2011 HCUP data, which likely under-
estimate the percentage of preterm births because the HCUP sample is limited to births in
the hospital setting (Henke et al. 2014; Kowlessar, Jiang, and Steiner 2013). Still, our analy-
sis may underestimate the total percentage of preterm births covered by Medicaid and
private insurance because not all states use the 2003 revised birth certificate, which specifi-
cally includes a question about payment source. In 2011, 14 states did not report any infor-
mation about payment source (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2011). Twelve
states in 2012 and nine states in 2013 had not yet adopted the revised birth certificate or
reported payment source (Martin et al. 2015). Our analysis focused on 2013, since the vast
majority of states (41 states plus DC) are represented in the data. Even so, we may still
underestimate the role of Medicaid, because states such as Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,
and West Virginia were excluded. Although smaller in terms of total births, these states
have a high percentage (>50%) of all births covered by Medicaid (Markus et al. 2013).
Similarly, one large state, New Jersey, is not included in the analysis. However, the percen-
tage of births covered by Medicaid in that state (28% in 2010) is much lower than the
national average (Markus et al. 2013).
This study has several limitations. First, the dataset is missing several states that have
not yet adopted the 2003-revised birth certificate. Thus, when we narrow the analysis
by data source, it is no longer fully representative of all births in the U.S. Second, the
main explanatory variable, payer source, does not allow for stratification between Medi-
caid fee-for-service and Medicaid managed care. Research has found that Medicaid
managed care may not improve birth outcomes but can impose higher costs on the
program, compared with Medicaid fee-for-service (Sparer 2012). Earlier research provided
ambiguous and conflicting findings on the effect of managed care on birth outcomes
(Krieger, Connell, and LoGerfo 1992). Third, the dataset is also missing several key vari-
ables reported in the literature to be associated with preterm birth, including alcohol con-
sumption, depression, illicit drug use, neighborhood characteristics, nutritional status,
periodontal disease, socioeconomic status, and participation in the WIC program
(Anum, Retchin, and Strauss 2010; Dasanayake et al. 2008; Feifen-de Jong et al. 2011;
Goldenberg et al. 2008; Kent et al. 2013; Patra et al. 2011; U.S.D.A. Food and Nutrition
Service 2012). Finally, this analysis does not reflect whether women received prenatal
care funded by Medicaid, since women enroll at different points during pregnancy and
some may be eligible only for emergency Medicaid during delivery.
Conclusion
Women covered by Medicaid are more likely to have preterm births, even after controlling
for various risk factors. Implementing effective preterm birth risk reduction strategies
could yield significant improvements in birth outcomes and could lower costs. Certain
social determinants and clinical and behavioral factors that increase preterm birth risk
are more prevalent among women enrolled in Medicaid than among privately insured
women. Effective interventions targeting pregnancy spacing, access to prenatal care,
smoking cessation, and healthy weight exist, and Medicaid should consider implementing
those more widely to improve birth outcomes and achieve substantial cost savings.
Maternal and child health agencies and advocates could promote coverage of these

 interventions by Medicaid programs in their state. Further research should be conducted
to determine the underlying causes of preterm birth that contribute to higher rates of
preterm birth among women with Medicaid coverage.
