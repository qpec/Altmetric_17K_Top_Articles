Early life microbial colonization and succession is critically important to healthy development with 
impacts on metabolic and immunologic processes throughout life. A longitudinal prospective cohort 
was recruited from midwifery practices to include infants born at full term gestation to women 
with uncomplicated pregnancies. Here we compare bacterial community succession in infants born 
vaginally, with no exposure to antibiotics (n = 53), with infants who were exposed to intrapartum 
antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for Group B Streptococcus (GBS; n = 14), and infants born by C-section 
(n = 7). Molecular profiles  of the 16 S rRNA genes indicate that there is a delay in the expansion of 
Bifidobacterium, which was the dominate infant gut colonizer, over the first 12 weeks and a persistence 
of Escherichia when IAP for GBS exposure is present during vaginal labour. Longer duration of IAP 
exposure increased the magnitude of the effect on Bifidobacterium populations, suggesting a longer 
delay in microbial community maturation. As with prior studies, we found altered gut colonisation 
following C-section that included a notable lack of Bacteroidetes. This study found that exposure of 
infants to IAP for GBS during vaginal birth affected aspects of gut microbial ecology that, although 
dramatic at early time points, disappeared by 12 weeks of age in most infants.
The intestinal microbiota is essential for metabolic, nutritional, physiological and immunologic processes and 
influences a broad range of health outcomes1,2. In the first hours and days following birth there is a rapid evolution 
of microbial communities3 becoming adult-like before 3 years of age4,5. When initial exposure to the maternal 
microbiota is altered, for instance due to birth by Caesarean section (C-section), colonisation of the infant gut has 
been shown to differ in both the type and distribution of organisms6–10. It is possible that an atypical microbiota 
established early in life disrupts the initiation of metabolic and immunologic processes and contributes to lifelong 
changes in the host but details about microbial succession during this formative period are limited. The microbi-
ome has been associated with chronic diseases in adulthood, such as obesity11,12, allergy and atopy13, inflamma-
tory bowel disease14, and the development of colon cancer15, however causal effects in either direction have not 
been shown. It is, therefore, essential to understand infant gut microbial community succession, in the absence of 
medical interventions, and to study the impacts of early life exposures on the processes involved.
In North America, as many as 50% of all low risk, full term infants are exposed to intrapartum antibiotic 
prophylaxis (IAP) for indications such as prevention of maternal infection associated with C-section birth16 and 
management of Group B Streptococcus (GBS)17. Although treatment with IAP is considered safe, the impact on 
gut microbiome development in the infant is uncertain. IAP may affect non-target bacterial populations within 
the mother and reduce the transmission of susceptible bacterial groups to the infant during delivery. In addition,

establishment of the gut microbiome may be altered as a result of IAP passed into the fetal/neonatal bloodstream 
through the placenta.
While many studies have addressed the gut microbiome in adults, research on the developing infant microbi-
ome has focused mainly on the impact of C-section birth7,9,10,18, infant feeding practices10,18 and administration of 
oral antibiotics to infants18,19. Here we describe early findings of the Baby & Mi pilot study20, a prospective birth 
cohort designed to specifically determine the effects of intrapartum antibiotic administration on the development 
of infant gut microbiome among a low-risk population in Ontario, Canada. This longitudinal study describes the 
very early gut microbiome development at four time points over the first 12 weeks of life.
Results
Description of cohort. 
The Baby & Mi pilot cohort20 enrolled 83 mother-infant pairs. Five participants were 
excluded as follows: ineligibility for continued follow up due to a high risk complication prior to birth (n = 1), 
withdrawal prior to birth (n = 1), lost to follow up (n = 2) and not providing any samples up to the 12 week time 
point (n = 1). As our intent was to focus on the influence of IAP for GBS on the developing gut microbiome, we 
also excluded 4 participants from this analysis due to exposure to IAP for GBS and C-section (n = 3) or exposure 
to antibiotics for treatment of a suspected infection (n = 1). An analysis of the effect of IAP for GBS on the infant 
gut microbiome that also accounts for delivery mode will be undertaken in the full study, should the number 
of participants be sufficient to overcome the inter-individual variability in the type and abundance of shared 
microbial signatures. Thus, the analysed cohort was comprised of 74 mother-infant pairs. Table 1 presents the 
characteristics of the analysed cohort and the antibiotic exposures, stratified by mode of birth and IAP exposure. 
Overall, 21 women received IAP of any kind during the birth (28%): 14 (19%) received penicillin for prevention 
of vertical transmission of GBS during the vaginal birth; and the 7 (10%) women undergoing a C-section received 
IAP for prevention of infection (cefazolin (n = 5), ampicillin (n = 1) or cephalexin (n = 1)). Among the 21 women 
exposed to IAP the median duration of exposure was 225 minutes (95th CI: 11, 831 minutes), with longer expo-
sures in the vaginal IAP for GBS group than in those receiving IAP for a C-section. Furthermore, 63% of the 
vaginal IAP group were exposed to antibiotics for >4 hours prior to delivery compare to none in the C-section 
group. All of the C-section deliveries occurred after the onset of active labour; none were electively scheduled. All 
babies were breastfed at least partially. Infant exposure to antibiotics was low in the first 12 weeks of life with only 
2 (3%) receiving antibiotics.
Effects of IAP and delivery mode on microbial communities. 
Overall, the gut microbiome of infants 
born vaginally without exposure to IAP differed significantly from that of infants born vaginally but exposed 
to IAP for GBS or born by C-section (also exposed to IAP). The bacterial community in fecal microbiota from 
infants exposed to IAP for GBS prior to vaginal birth, differed from that of unexposed infants at 10 days and 6 
weeks of age (p < 0.05) but no differences were seen by 12 weeks (Table 2; Fig. 1A). The relative contribution of 
each genera to these differences is presented in Table 3. Interestingly, when assessing the impact on microbial 
communities of the duration of IAP exposure within vaginal births with IAP for GBS, there was a significant effect 
on bacterial communities at 12 weeks only (Table 2; p < 0.01), with the contribution of each genera to these dif-
ferences shown in Table 4. This suggests that for most infants born vaginally, the effects of IAP on the microbiome 
disappear by 12 weeks of age but lasting effects remain for infants exposed to the longest course of antibiotics.
The gut microbiome of infants born by C-section was different from the microbiome in vaginally born infants, 
without IAP exposure, at each time point except 6 weeks (p < 0.05; Table 2; Fig. 1A). The contributions of each 
genera to this is presented in Table S1. No differences in the fecal microbiota of vaginally born infants exposed 
to IAP for GBS compared to C-section were seen in spite of the fact that these 2 groups were exposed to different

intrapartum antibiotics. This last analysis, however, was likely underpowered due to the small sample size and 
high variability in the composition of the microbiome in infants born by C-section.
Phylum level summaries (Fig. 1B) indicate a delay in colonization with Actinobacteria in both vaginally-born 
infants exposed to IAP for GBS and those delivered by C-section. Further, in vaginally-born IAP for GBS 
exposed infants, there was a delay in colonization by Firmicutes and prolonged persistence in the abundance of 
Proteobacteria. In contrast, the gut microbiome in infants born by C-section lacked Bacteroidetes up to 12 weeks 
of age and contained a greater abundance of Firmicutes compared to infants born vaginally without exposure to 
IAP. These findings highlight that the pattern of the development of the gut microbiota differed between groups 
of infants born vaginally and those born by C-section and exposed to intrapartum antibiotics.
Bacterial species richness and Shannon diversity in the gut microbiome of infants born vaginally and exposed 
to IAP for GBS was significantly lower (p < 0.01) at early time points but, reached levels similar to communities in 
unexposed infants by 12 weeks of age (Fig. 2A). Trends could not be calculated for infants born by C-section due 
to the large amount of variability and the small sample size (n = 7).
Effects of IAP and delivery mode on individual bacterial taxa. 
The effect of IAP exposure on the 
abundance of individual bacterial genera over time was assessed with a linear mixed model in order to account 
for individual variability. Within vaginal births, exposure to IAP for GBS had a significant negative effect on the 
abundance of Bifidobacterium (p < 0.01), a positive effect on the abundance of Escherichia (p < 0.05), at 12 weeks 
of age (Fig. 2B).
The duration of IAP for GBS exposure before birth on vaginally born infants had an effect on the overall gut 
microbiome of infants at 12 weeks of age. In order to speculate about which bacterial taxa might be contribut-
ing to this difference we have reported the contribution of each genus to the variability in the model (Table 4). 
Notably, for each hour of IAP for GBS administration during vaginal birth there was a decrease of 7.2% in the 
abundance of Bifidobacterium. This was also illustrated in Fig. 2B where the duration of IAP for GBS exposure 
had a negative effect on Bifidobacterium over time (p < 0.01) and positive effect on the abundance of Clostridium 
(p < 0.05) over time (Fig. 2B).
The abundance of several bacterial genera was associated with C-section delivery when compared with infants 
born vaginally and not exposed to IAP (Table S2). Notably there was a significant decrease in Bifidobacteria, 
Bacteroides and Escherichia in C-section born infants and an increase in unclassified genera of Enterobacteriaceae 
and Clostridium over the first 12 weeks of life.
Discussion
Succession of bacterial populations during early infancy has an important influence on early immunological 
and metabolic programming that can affect long-term health21,22. The current study examines the succession of 
bacterial populations during early infancy in a healthy, full term, breastfed population while taking exposure to 
intrapartum antibiotics into account. We present here differences based on v3 sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene, 
which, although not accounting for complete species or strain level difference, illustrate the structure of the gut 
microbiome at these early time points. In addition to our findings supporting recent literature on the composi-
tion of the early microbiome and the influence of C-section birth (including antibiotic exposure) on the pattern 
of microbiome development, we made several novel observations. We identified a distinct influence of IAP for 
GBS on the fecal microbiota of infants born vaginally and noted that the length of intrapartum exposure to the 
antibiotics influenced this impact.
Similar to previous studies that found the infant gut microbiome of newborns were colonized mainly by 
Bifidobacterium, Escherichia and Bacteroides10,23, we found that amongst healthy, full-term, vaginally born infants 
not exposed to IAP, an abundance of Bifidobacterium came to dominate the bacterial communities in many

infants by 12 weeks, with a corresponding decrease of other members of the communities that were most domi-
nant at 3 days and 10 days, notably Escherichia and Streptococcus.
Early life events such as preterm birth24, C- section8–10,18,19 and formula feeding7,10,25 have been shown to alter 
patterns of succession. However, prior studies have not accounted for IAP for GBS during vaginal delivery, which 
may have influenced these results. We have demonstrated a clear effect of IAP for GBS on the infant gut micro-
biome amongst vaginally born infants. The fecal microbiota of IAP exposed infants had significantly lower alpha 
diversity and there was a delay in the colonization patterns in these infants compared with unexposed infants. 
Bacterial genera most impacted by IAP for GBS during vaginal birth included Bifidobacterium, Escherichia and 
Parabacteroides. By 12 weeks of age, community diversity and structure of the bacterial communities of vaginally 
born infants exposed to IAP for GBS was similar to that of unexposed infants. However, for every hour of IAP 
administration, there was a decrease of 7% in the abundance of Bifidobacterium at 12 weeks suggesting that 
infants with longer IAP exposures experienced a more persistent impact. Previous studies on the effect of IAP6 
(or GBS26) on the early infant gut microbiome have overlooked its impact on populations of Bifidobacterium.

Whether this is due to underestimation of Bifidobacteria in these previous studies or a genuine difference in bac-
terial profiles within participants is unknown.
Birth by C-section has been associated with negative health outcomes in childhood and later life such as 
allergy, asthma and obesity27,28. Consistent with previous studies, we observed an effect of C-section delivery 
on the infant microbiome. Though the number of infants born by C-section was low, it is important to note that 
none of these babies was a planned C-section, meaning that all of the mothers had entered labour. Results from 
previous studies on the effect of C-section8–10 matched what we observed, namely an absence of Bacteroidetes 
for up to 12 weeks and a reduction in Actinobacteria. The reduction in the abundance of Bacteroidetes was more 
pronounced after C-section delivery (for which IAP is also administered) than it was after vaginal birth with IAP 
for GBS when compared with infants born vaginally and not exposed to IAP. This suggests that IAP exposure acts 
independently of mode of delivery in influencing the gut microbiota over the first 12 weeks of life. It is important 
to consider that the antibiotics utilized for GBS are different from those used to prevent maternal infection asso-
ciated with C-section.
The first 12 weeks of life is a period marked by few outside exposures, compared to later in infancy, and is a 
critical period for development of the infant gastrointestinal microbiome. This study found that IAP for GBS 
affected all aspects of gut microbial ecology including species richness, diversity, community structure, and the 
abundance of colonizing bacterial genera. We found that although dramatic at early time points, effects of IAP for 
GBS on the microbiome during vaginal birth largely disappeared by 12 weeks of age in most infants. The impact 
of IAP for GBS on the gut community in infants was also impacted by the duration of IAP administration. This 
study recapitulated previously published observations examining the influence of C-section delivery, and sug-
gests that IAP may act independently of mode of delivery to impact the bacterial populations that colonize the 
infant gut. A larger study is underway20 that will determine the long-term consequences of IAP for GBS on both 
microbial community succession and on host health and disease risk and provide the power necessary to explore 
in more depth the influence of maternal and infant covariates on the infant gut microbiome.
Methods
Study design, setting and participants. 
A cohort of mother-infant pairs was formed by enrolling eligi-
ble women from midwifery practices in Hamilton and Burlington, Ontario, Canada between July 1st 2012 and 
December 31st 2013. Women were eligible to participate in the study if they were under the care of a midwife 
which necessitates that they have a healthy pregnancy with low predictable risk (i.e. low risk) defined according to 
the Ontario Antenatal record29 with no pregnancy complications now or in the past, no significant maternal med-
ical disease, no prior perinatal morbidity or mortality, with adequate fetal growth and they needed to be planning

multiple pregnancy or a preterm birth (before 37 completed weeks gestation).
Birth data and obstetrical history, including maternal age, place of birth, mode of birth, IAP exposure (dura-
tion, dosage, type of antibiotic) and gender were collected from antenatal and birth records and mother and infant 
charts by the midwives. Infant stool samples and data about infant diet and infant antibiotic use were collected 
from the mothers as closely as possible to 3 days, 10 days, 6 weeks and 12 weeks postpartum. Diapers containing 
stool were transferred to a plastic storage bag, stored frozen in a household freezer and delivered to the labora-
tory by the women when they attended study visits with their infants at weeks 6 and 12 at McMaster University 
Medical Centre. Methods were carried out in accordance with the Research Ethics Boards at all participating 
healthcare organisations (Hamilton Health Sciences Faculty of Health Sciences (Project number: 12-201), St.

Bacterial DNA isolation and Illumina sequencing of bacterial tags. 
DNA was extracted from 100–
200 mg of stool with a custom DNA extraction protocol involving mechanical and enzymatic lysis followed by a 
phenol:chloroform extraction and purification, as previously described30. The bacterial 16 S ribosomal ribonucleic 
acid (rRNA) gene v3 region (150 bp) was amplified as in31 and libraries were sequenced in the McMaster Genomics 
Facility in the forward and reverse direction on the Illumina MiSeq instrument as described previously30. 
The completed run was de-multiplexed with Illumina’s Casava software.
Sequence processing and analysis. 
Illumina sequences were processed as described30,32,39. Briefly, after 
sequence trimming, alignment and filtering to remove sequences with length <100 bp, operational taxonomic 
units (OTU) were picked using AbundantOTU+ 
33 with a clustering threshold of 97%. Taxonomy for each OTU’s 
representative sequence was assigned using the Ribosomal Database Project classifier34 with a minimum confi-
dence cut-off of 0.8 against the Greengenes (2013 release) reference database. All OTUs classified as “Root:Other”
, 
indicating that they were not of bacterial origin, were excluded.
Species number was estimated from OTU abundances with use of the rarefy function within the vegan pack-
age in R, which implements Hurlbert’s35 formulation for calculating the expected species richness in random 
subsamples from the community, calculated with a depth of 11,231 sequences. Shannon diversity was calculated 
with the diversity function, within the vegan package in R36. For principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) beta diver-
sity was calculated with the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure36 on relative OTU abundances. For comparative 
analyses (permutational multivariate analysis of variance, described below) beta diversity was also calculated 
with the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure but on genus level abundances, since OTU level analysis (excluding 
singletons) did not indicate an effect of IAP for GBS (10 days p = 0.30, 6 weeks p = 0.08). This was likely due to 
inter-individual variability in OTU carriage since many OTUs provided only a minor contribution to the varia-
bility in the microbiome due to IAP for GBS exposure, whereas only a small number of genera contributed greatly 
to the IAP for GBS effect (Figure S1).
Statistical analyses. 
Beta diversity was explored with PCoA ordination of Bray-Curtis dissimilarities cal-
culated from relative OTU abundances. Next, a comparative analysis was done with permutational multivariate 
analysis of variance using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices calculated from genus level taxonomic assignments 
with the adonis function within the vegan package in R36 and coefficients above 0.005 (i.e., a >0.5% change in 
bacterial genus level abundance between treatments) were reported in a separate table. For the comparative anal-
ysis, samples were first stratified by collection time point, then by mode of birth. Amongst vaginally born infants 
with IAP for GBS exposure, the effect of IAP (binary variable) and duration of IAP administration (continuous 
variable) were analysed. Finally, the effect of mode of birth on the microbiome was compared among Caesarean 
born and vaginally born infants who were not exposed to IAP for GBS.
There was a distribution of ages at each collection point (Figure S2), therefore analysis of univariate outcomes 
was done over time (as a continuous variable) using a generalized linear mixed effects model with infant age (in 
weeks) as a fixed effect and individual infant as a random effect, to account for individual variation. This was done 
using the lme4 package in R37 significance was determined with the lmerTest package in R38. The effect of IAP for 
GBS on alpha diversity estimates was modeled within vaginal births only by adding IAP to the model as a fixed 
effect. Abundance of each of the top 10 bacterial genera was modeled over time within infants born vaginally and 
either exposure to IAP for GBS or duration of IAP exposure for GBS included as a fixed effect. The effect of deliv-
ery method was similarly modeled, however, first excluding all vaginal births with IAP for GBS then including 
Caesarean delivery as a fixed effect. Multiple testing correction was not applied, due to the exploratory nature of 
this study, whose purpose was for the generation of hypotheses and not for definitive inference.
