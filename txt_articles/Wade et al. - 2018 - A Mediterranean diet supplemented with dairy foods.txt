ABSTRACT
Background: The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) offers benefits to
cardiovascular health but may not meet Western recommendations
for calcium and dairy intake, which could impede long-term
adoption.
Objective: The current study aimed to determine the effect of
a MedDiet supplemented with dairy foods on cardiovascular risk
factors.
Design: A randomized, controlled, crossover design compared a
MedDiet with 3–4 daily servings of dairy (MedDairy) and a low-
fat (LF) control diet. Forty-one participants aged ≥45 y and at
risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were randomly allocated to
their first intervention, either the MedDairy or LF diet. Participants
followed each intervention for 8 wk, and an 8-wk washout period
separated interventions. The primary outcome was home-measured
systolic blood pressure (SBP) assessed in the morning, afternoon,
and evening. Secondary outcomes included clinic-measured blood
pressure (morning), body composition, blood lipids, C-reactive
protein (CRP), plasma glucose, serum insulin, and the Framingham
Risk Score.
Results: Compared with the LF intervention, the MedDairy
intervention resulted in a significantly lower morning SBP (mean
difference: −1.6 mm Hg; 95% CI: −2.8, −0.4 mm Hg; P = 0.01),
lower morning diastolic blood pressure (mean difference: −1.0;
95% CI: −1.7, −0.2 mm Hg; P = 0.01) and clinic SBP (mean
difference: −3.5 mm Hg; 95% CI: −6.4, −0.7 mm Hg; P = 0.02),
significantly higher HDL cholesterol (mean difference: 0.04 mmol/L;
95% CI: 0.01, 0.06 mmol/L; P < 0.01), lower triglycerides (mean
difference: = −0.05 mmol/L; 95% CI: −0.08, −0.01 mmol/L;
P < 0.01), and lower ratio of total to HDL cholesterol (mean
difference: −0.4; 95% CI: −0.6, −0.2; P < 0.001). No effects were
observed for other outcome measures.
Conclusions: Following a MedDiet with additional dairy foods
led to significant changes in markers of cardiovascular risk over
8 wk. The MedDiet supplemented with dairy may be appropriate
for an improvement in cardiovascular risk factors in a population
at risk of CVD. This trial was registered at anzctr.org.au as
ACTRN12616000309482.

meat and commercial sweets (1). Through these foods, the Med-
Diet delivers a range of bioactive nutrients including antioxidants,
fiber, vitamins and minerals, polyphenols, monounsaturated fats,
and omega-3 polyunsaturated fats (2).
Previous research indicates that the MedDiet is capable of
reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, reducing CVD
mortality, and promoting longevity (3–7). Proposed mechanisms
suggest that the MedDiet reduces inflammation (8–10), which
leads to significant improvements in blood pressure (BP), lipid
profiles, insulin sensitivity, oxidative stress, and atherosclerosis
(3–6, 11–14).
The Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) study,
a large-scale randomized controlled trial in >7000 individuals,
examined the efficacy of a MedDiet against a low-fat (LF)
control diet in a Spanish population at risk of CVD (15). After
a median follow-up of 4.8 y, improvements were reported for
ambulatory BP, lipid profiles, insulin sensitivity, and indicators of
oxidation and inflammatory stress (5). Further, incidence of major
cardiovascular events and CVD mortality were significantly
reduced.
Western countries, including the United States, are beginning
to recommend the MedDiet as a healthful dietary pattern (16).
However, discrepancies between the nutrients provided by the
MedDiet and those required by Western populations warrant
attention. Notably, a traditional MedDiet does not satisfy the
Australian Dietary Guidelines for dairy foods and calcium intake.
The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council
currently recommends 2.5–4 servings of dairy foods/d for adults.
In contrast, a typical MedDiet only provides 1–2 servings of dairy
foods/d (1). The amount of calcium provided by a MedDiet is
estimated at between 700 and 820 mg/d (17, 18). During the
Mediterranean Diet for Cardiovascular and Cognitive Health in
the Elderly (MedLey) trial, Australian participants consumed an
average of 930 mg Ca/d while achieving high adherence to the
MedDiet (3). This meets the Recommended Dietary Intake (RDI)
of 750 mg for European countries (19). However, Australian
women up to the age of 50 y and men up to the age of 70 y are
advised to consume 1000 mg/d and 1300 mg thereafter (20). If
the amount of calcium provided by a traditional MedDiet does
not meet Australian Dietary Guidelines it may be inadequate
for the long-term health of Australians, potentially reducing the
sustainability of long-term consumption.
It is unknown whether supplementing the MedDiet with dairy
foods, to meet Australian guidelines and Nutrient Reference
Values, will compromise the known cardiovascular benefits of
the diet. Findings from individual studies indicate that dairy food
consumption may improve markers of CVD (21–23), whereas
meta-analyses have found either neutral or favorable associations
between dairy food intake and cardiovascular-related outcomes,
including hypertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes, CVD risk, and
cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (23–25). The current
study therefore aimed to examine the effects of a MedDiet
modified to meet Australian dairy and calcium recommendations.
Specifically, cardiovascular-related outcomes were evaluated in a
sample of Australians at risk of CVD.
METHODS
The study protocol for a MedDiet with adequate dairy foods
has been described in detail elsewhere (26).
Ethics
The trial was registered with the Australia and New Zealand
Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12616000309482) on 9 March
2016 and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki
guidelines. All procedures involving human participants were
approved by the University of South Australia Ethics Committee
(no. 34,954).
Design
A randomized controlled trial used a 2 × 2 crossover design to
compare a MedDiet with adequate dairy (MedDairy) against an
LF control diet. Participants followed each dietary intervention
for 8 wk, and the 2 intervention periods were separated by an 8-
wk washout during which participants returned to their habitual
diet (Figure 1). Using block randomization and a block size of
4, an independent staff member randomly assigned participants
to their first dietary intervention (MedDairy or LF), stratified by
gender and age. Allocation concealment ensured study personnel
and participants were not aware of the allocated intervention
group before enrollment.
Participants
Australian volunteers aged between 45 and 75 y and at risk of
CVD were recruited from metropolitan Adelaide. Cardiovascular
risk was determined by systolic BP (SBP) ≥120 mm Hg and the
presence of ≥2 of the following risk factors: BMI (in kg/m2) ≥25;
abdominal adiposity (waist circumference >94 cm for men and
>80 cm for women); elevated total cholesterol (≥5.5 mmol/L),
triglycerides (≥2.0 mmol/L), or LDL cholesterol (≥3.5 mmol/L)
or low concentrations of HDL cholesterol (≤0.9 mmol/L for
men and ≤1.0 mmol/L for women); impaired glucose tolerance
(between 6.1 and 7.8 mmol/L); or a family history of CVD
or type 2 diabetes. Aside from cardiovascular risk, participants
were free of any cardiovascular, liver, kidney, respiratory, or
gastrointestinal disease; cognitive impairment; type 1 or type
2 diabetes; malignancy in the past 6 mo; and significant head
trauma or psychiatric condition. Participants also completed
a MedDiet screening questionnaire based on that used in the
PREDIMED study to ensure that they were not already following
a MedDiet.
A total of 41 community-dwelling Australian men (n = 13)
and women (n = 28) commenced the study between April and
June 2016. Participants were randomly allocated into 2 groups
to determine their starting diet and order of interventions. Group
1 (n = 20) completed the MedDairy intervention first, followed
by the LF intervention; group 2 (n = 21) completed the LF
intervention first, followed by the MedDairy intervention.
Procedure
Participants attended the Sansom Institute for Health Research
Clinical Trial Facility 1 wk before baseline to be enrolled by
study personnel and to receive study information and equipment.
Clinic assessments were conducted at weeks 0, 8, 16, and 24
while participants were fasted and included the measurement
of BP, anthropometry, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and
the collection of fasting blood. At the beginning of each

dietary phase participants met with a dietitian to discuss dietary
guidelines. At week 0, the dietitian also informed participants
of their group allocation. Throughout each intervention phase
participants also attended biweekly dietetic visits to discuss
progress, difficulties, and possible adverse events. During the
washout period, participants were instructed to return to their
habitual diet. Change in medications, dietary supplements, and
exercise was noted throughout the course of the study.
Dietary interventions
Guidelines for the MedDairy and LF interventions were
adapted from the PREDIMED study and tailored for an
Australian population (15).
The MedDairy diet
During the MedDairy intervention, participants were in-
structed to adhere to the following:
• 3–4 daily servings of dairy foods (1 serving = 250 mL LF
milk, 40–120 g hard or semisoft to soft cheese, 200 g LF
Greek yogurt, or 200 g tzatziki dip);
• ≤1 serving of cheese (any type)/d (1 serving = 40 g hard,
50 g semi-soft, or 120 g soft cheese such as ricotta and
cottage cheese);
• abundant use of EVOO [minimum of 1 tablespoon
(20 mL)/d];
• ≥2–3 daily servings of fresh fruit (1 serving = 150 g fresh,
40 g dried, or 1 cup canned in juice);
• ≥3 weekly servings of legumes (1 serving = 75 g);
• ≥3 weekly servings of fish and seafood (≥1 serving of oily
fish; 1 serving = 100 g cooked);
• ≥5 weekly servings of nuts or seeds (1 serving = 30 g; 7.5 g
hazelnuts, 15 g walnuts, 7.5 g almonds supplied for each
serving);
• ad libitum consumption of whole-grain cereal products
(bread, pasta, rice, cereal), nuts, eggs, and raw and cooked
vegetables;
• select white meats (poultry without skin) instead of red
meats or processed meats;
• limit consumption of red meat (remove all visible fat), cured
ham, and chocolate to ≤1 serving/wk (1 serving of red
meat/cured ham = 100 g; 1 serving of chocolate = 50 g);
• use EVOO as the main culinary fat in cooking and for
dressing vegetables and salad;
• cook regularly (at least twice a week) with a tomato-based
sauce (EVOO, tomato, garlic, and onion);
• dress vegetables, pasta, rice, and other dishes with EVOO,
tomato, garlic, and onion sauce;
• eliminate or limit the consumption of cream, butter,
margarine, cold meat, pate, duck, carbonated or sugared
beverages, pastries, commercial bakery products (cakes,
donuts, cookies), desserts (puddings), French fries, potato
crisps, and sweets; and
• for usual drinkers, red wine was recommended as the
preferred source of alcohol with a maximum of 2 standard
drinks/d (200 mL = 2 standard drinks) (27).
Notably, EVOO recommendations of ≥1 tablespoon/d differ
from the PREDIMED trial, in which participants were advised
to consume ≥4 tablespoons olive oil/d. In contrast to the
PREDIMED trial, the current study was conducted in Australia,
where EVOO is not part of the habitual diet nor consumed
in abundance (28). Minimum EVOO recommendations were
therefore reduced in order to increase the palatability and
sustainability of the MedDairy intervention. Furthermore, the
MedLey trial, with the same recommendations for EVOO as were
used here, reported improvements in markers of cardiovascular
health after adherence to a MedDiet (3).
Consistent with Australian Dietary Guidelines (29), serving
sizes of dairy foods delivered 300 mg Ca. Three to 4 servings of
dairy each day provided 900–1200 mg Ca, whereas vegetables
and nuts provided ˜
100 mg. Based on this modeling, the
MedDairy intervention provided 1000–1300 mg Ca/d, thus
meeting the Australian RDI for calcium. The combination of
almonds, walnuts, and hazelnuts was recommended to reflect the
dietary guidelines from the PREDIMED trial and to provide a
combination of MUFAs and PUFAs.

WADE ET AL.
To assist with introducing the MedDairy diet to the interven-
tion group and to assist with dietary adherence, the following
foods were provided: Chobani Greek yogurt (Chobani Australia
Pty. Ltd.); almonds (Almond Board of Australia); walnuts and
hazelnuts; EVOO (Cobram Estate); Mainland Tasty regular-fat
and reduced-fat cheese slices (Fonterra Co-Operative Group);
Edgell chickpeas, cannellini beans, red kidney beans, 4-bean mix,
and lentils (Simplot Australia Pty Ltd.); and canned John West
tuna “tempters” and salmon “tempters” (Simplot Australia Pty.
Ltd.).
The LF diet
The LF control was implemented to replicate the design of
the PREDIMED trial (15). Furthermore, an LF control enables
examination of the feasibility of the MedDairy intervention in
Australia, where LF diets have been considered best practice and
are frequently consumed and recommended for heart health.
During the LF intervention participants were instructed to
follow their habitual diet while reducing their total fat intake by
choosing LF foods and using LF cooking methods. Restricted
foods included oil, butter, margarine, full-fat dairy products,
processed and high-fat meats, nuts, chocolate, cakes, biscuits,
pastry, and ice cream. Participants were instructed to replace
restricted foods with LF alternatives such as breads, cereals,
legumes, rice, vegetables, fruits, lean meats, and LF dairy food
choices. Participants were specifically instructed to consume
≤20 mL oil/d and ≤2 teaspoons butter or margarine/d and to
remove visible fat and skin from meat and fish before cooking.
Measures
BP
SBP is one of the leading modifiable risk factors for CVD and
mortality (30) and was chosen as the primary outcome. Because
home BP assessments have stronger predictive power than clinic
BP assessments (31), participants were provided with an A&D
Company Ltd. digital BP monitor to measure their SBP, diastolic
blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) 3 times every morning,
afternoon, and evening for 6 d in the week preceding each clinic
assessment visit. This allowed the collection of 54 measurements
of BP readings for analysis at 4 time points over the course of the
trial (at prebaseline, week 7, week 15, and week 23). BP and HR
were also measured at each of the clinic assessment visits with the
use of an Omron Healthcare Co. digital BP monitor (model 1A1B
Hem-7000-CIL).
Secondary outcomes
Secondary outcomes included BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, body
composition (percentage body fat, lean mass, and abdominal
adiposity) assessed via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, fasting
blood lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP), fasting plasma glu-
cose, fasting serum insulin, and the Framingham Risk Score
(FRS) (32).
Lipids, CRP, glucose, and insulin were measured at an external
National Association of Testing Authorities–accredited labora-
tory via standard procedures. Insulin resistance was calculated
with the use of the HOMA2 Calculator version 2.2.3 (33). A
higher HOMA2-IR score indicates greater insulin resistance.
Erythrocyte cell fatty acids were collected to determine
change in the ratio of monounsaturated fat to saturated fat
(MUFAs:SFAs). Samples were frozen at −20◦C and will be
stored at −80◦C until funding can be secured for analyses.
Dietary adherence
During the MedDairy intervention a weekly semiquantitative
checklist was provided to assess adherence and assist participants
in becoming familiar with foods and serving sizes associated with
the MedDairy diet. The semiquantitative checklist was based on
that used in the MedLey study, a previous study conducted in our
research center (34). Participants were instructed to complete the
checklist daily with the use of a simple tick system (1 tick = 1
serving).
Participants were also provided with a 14-item MedDiet
adherence tool for each fortnight during the MedDairy inter-
vention and a 9-item LF diet adherence tool for each fortnight
during the LF intervention. These tools were adapted from
the PREDIMED study to align with Australian food supply
and alcohol recommendations and were designed to capture
a generalized pattern of consumption relevant to each dietary
phase. The semiquantitative checklist and diet-specific adherence
tools were completed throughout each dietary phase and returned
at biweekly dietetic visits.
A 3-d weighed food record was completed 1 wk before and in
the final week of each dietary intervention to calculate energy,
macronutrient, and micronutrient intakes. The weighed food
record was also used to calculate dietary adherence according to
a 10-point MedDiet Score (MDS), adapted from Trichopoulou
et al. (7). Food intake as grams per day was divided into 10 food
groups, and a gender-specific median was calculated for each
food group at week 0. For vegetables, fruit, legumes, cereals,
nuts, fish, dairy, and MUFA:SFA, participants scored 1 point for
consumption above the median and 0 for consumption under the
median. For meat and meat products, participants scored 1 point
for intake below the median and 0 for intake above the median.
For alcohol, women consuming 5–25 g/d and men consuming
10–50 g/d were awarded 1 point. To calculate adherence to the a
priori MedDiet we also applied a literature-based MedDiet score
developed by Sofi et al. (35) (S-MDS). Similar to the MDS, the
S-MDS includes 9 food groups relevant to the MedDiet. For food
groups typically consumed within a MedDiet (vegetables, fruit,
legumes, cereals, fish, and olive oil), 2 points were awarded for
the highest level of consumption, 1 point for the middle level of
consumption, and 0 points for the lowest level of consumption.
For foods not typical of a MedDiet (meat and meat products),
2 points were awarded for the lowest level of consumption, 1
point for the middle level of consumption, and 0 points for the
highest level of consumption. For alcohol, 1 point was awarded
for <12 g/d, 2 points for 12–24 g/d, and 0 points for >24 g/d.
In the original S-MDS, dairy intake is scored similarly to meat
and meat products. However, the current study sought to increase
dairy consumption and therefore awarded 2 points for the highest
intake, 1 point for medium intake, and 0 points for the lowest
intake (Supplemental Table 1).

Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed with the use of STATA (version 13;
StataCorp) and IBM SPSS Statistics (version 21). To detect
a clinically relevant difference of 2.5 mm Hg in the primary
outcome of home SBP with ≥90% power, a sample size of
31 volunteers was required. This calculation assumes a within-
group SD of 14 mm Hg, a within-subject correlation between
the 4 BP measures at each visit of r = 0.6, and a between-
phase within-subject correlation of ρ = 0.5. This correlation
(ρ) and the crossover design reduce the number of required
participants by a factor of 1 / [(1 − ρ)/2] (46), that is, from
n = ∼124 for a parallel-group design with the use of ANCOVA
(n = 62/group) to n = 31 subjects in total. To account for a
withdrawal rate of 30%, an additional 9 volunteers were recruited.
Residuals were screened for normality, and non-normal variables
were transformed through the use of log10 and square root
transformations.
Linear mixed-effects models included terms for Diet (Med-
Dairy compared with LF), Visit (1 or 2), Order (1 or 2), and
Period (1 or 2). Preliminary analyses were conducted to detect
significant period and carryover effects. Where significant period
effects were observed, a Diet × Visit × Period term was included
in the model to allow the Diet × Visit effect, the primary
effect of interest, to vary by period. Where carryover effects
were observed, a Visit × Period interaction was included to
obtain separate estimates for the 2 intervention periods. The
inclusion of the Visit term in the model provided adjustment
for any group differences at baseline and allowed interpretation
of any between-group differences at each visit (with the Group
× Visit term) as differences in baseline-adjusted changes. The
Diet × Visit effect then allowed us to estimate the differences
in baseline-adjusted Visit 2 values between the 2 interventions.
Participant IDs were included in the model as a random intercept.
Weight at each time point was included as a covariate for
all cardiometabolic outcomes, excluding measures of body
composition and adiposity, because any change in weight might
influence the results (36). Any missing data were accounted for
in the mixed-effects models by the use of best linear unbiased
predictions.
A significant Diet × Visit interaction term indicates an overall
significant effect between the 2 interventions and is presented
as “estimated mean difference between interventions (MedDairy
compared with LF)” with 95% CIs. Positive values indicate
MedDairy outcomes were greater than LF outcomes. Negative
values indicate MedDairy outcomes were less than LF outcomes.
Continuous variables are presented as means ± SEMs.
Results were considered significant where P < 0.05, unless α
was adjusted for multiple comparisons. For SBP, DBP, and HR,
an adjusted α of 0.02 (0.05/3) was applied to control for multiple
comparisons across morning, afternoon, and evening readings.
For measures of blood lipids, an adjusted α of 0.01 (0.05/5)
was applied to control for multiple comparisons across total
triglycerides, total cholesterol, HD cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,
and cholesterol:HDL. For measures of body composition, an
adjusted α of 0.006 (0.05/9) was applied to control for multiple
related comparisons across weight, BMI, waist circumference,
hip circumference, fat mass (%), lean mass (%), fat mass
(kilograms), lean mass (kilograms), and abdominal fat. For
percentage energy from macronutrients, an adjusted α of 0.01
(0.05/4) was applied to control for multiple comparisons across
percentage energy from protein, percentage energy from total fat,
percentage energy from carbohydrates, and percentage energy
from alcohol. For fatty acids, an adjusted α of 0.02 (0.05/3) was
applied to control for multiple comparisons across percentage
energy from saturated fat, percentage energy from MUFAs, and
percentage energy from PUFAs. An adjusted α of 0.005 (0.05/10)
was applied to control for multiple comparisons across whole
grains, refined grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, meat/meat
alternatives, red meat, nuts and seeds, total dairy, and EVOO.
For dairy foods, an adjusted α of 0.02 (0.05/3) was applied for
comparisons across milk, cheese, and yogurt.
For the primary outcome, home SBP, previous studies have
indicated that readings taken on the first day might be higher than
those taken on subsequent days. Daily averages were computed
for home SBP at week 0, and paired-samples t tests were
conducted to compare day 1 with all other days. No significant
differences were detected at P < 0.05, and therefore day 1
SBP readings were retained in the analysis. Averages were also
computed for the first, second, and third readings taken at week
0. Paired-samples t tests showed significant differences of first
readings as compared with second and third readings. First
readings were therefore excluded from the final analysis.
Nutrient intake was calculated with the use of Foodworks
9, databases AusFoods17 and AusBrands17 [Xyris Software
(Australia) Pty. Ltd.]. The grouping of individual foods into
MedDiet components is presented in Supplemental Table 2.
Baseline medians of MedDiet food groups for the calculation
of the MDS are presented in Supplemental Table 3. Calcium
RDIs were calculated based on individual participant age and
gender according to the Australian National Health and Medical
Research Council guidelines (37).
RESULTS
Thirty-eight participants completed the first dietary phase and
washout (MedDairy: n = 19; LF: n = 19), and 37 participants
completed the second dietary phase of the study by January 2017
(MedDairy: n = 19; LF: n = 18). Figure 2 shows the flow of
participants through the study. Four participants withdrew during
the study. Reasons for withdrawal included family commitments
(MedDairy: n = 1), illness preventing adherence to the dietary
intervention (MedDairy: n = 1; LF: n = 1), and difficulties
in blood collection (LF: n = 1). All participants with baseline
data (n = 41) were included in the following intention-to-treat
analyses.
Baseline characteristics for group 1 (MedDairy intervention
first) and group 2 (LF intervention first) are shown in Table 1.
At baseline, characteristics of the 2 groups were similar, with the
exception of home SBP (millimeters of mercury), which was 4.1
mm Hg higher in group 1.
Home BP and HR
Results for home BP are presented in Table 2. For participants
who completed BP measurements at all 4 time points (n = 37),
a mean of 49 measurements were taken, indicating 90%
compliance with instruction.
Compared with LF, the MedDairy intervention resulted in
significantly lower morning home SBP and DBP and significantly

lower afternoon home HR. No significant differences were
observed for afternoon or evening home SBP or DBP.
Clinic measures
Results for clinic measures are presented in Table 3. Compared
with the LF intervention, the MedDairy intervention resulted
in significantly lower clinic SBP, significantly higher HDL
cholesterol, and significantly lower total triglycerides and ratio of
total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol. No significant differences
were observed for clinic DBP or HR, total cholesterol, LDL
cholesterol, insulin, glucose, HOMA scores, CRP, or FRS.
Compared with the MedDairy intervention, the LF interven-
tion resulted in significantly lower fat mass (kilograms) and
significantly higher lean mass (%). No significant differences
were observed for BMI, waist and hip circumferences, abdominal
fat, or bone mineral density.
Dietary adherence
According to the modified PREDIMED diet adherence tools,
the MDS and S-MDS participants were generally adherent to both
dietary interventions. The mean PREDIMED MedDiet score at
screening was 5.4 out of 14 and increased to a mean ± SD of
12.9 ± 0.4 during the MedDairy intervention, indicating 92%
adherence and an increase of 7.5 points, from moderate to high
MedDiet adherence. The mean ± SD PREDIMED LF score
across the LF intervention was 7.8 ± 0.2, out of a maximum of 9
points, indicating 87% adherence.
The mean ± SD MDS increased from 4.3 ± 1.9 at week
0 to 6.9 ± 1.4 at week 8 of the MedDairy intervention. In
comparison, the MDS did not increase from week 0 to week 8
of the LF intervention (Figure 3). Similarly, the mean ± SD S-
MDS increased from 6.7 ± 3.1 to 10.5 ± 3.2 by the end of the
MedDairy intervention. During the LF intervention, the mean ±
SD S-MDS increased from 6.9 ± 2.7 to 7.0 ± 2.4 (Figure 4).
Dairy consumption
Frequency values of dairy servings per day are presented
in Table 4. During the MedDairy intervention, the minimum
recommendation for dairy foods was 3 servings/d, equating to
42 servings/fortnight. The maximum based on 4 servings/d was
56 servings/fortnight.
Values for nutrient consumption across intervention periods
are shown in Table 5. At baseline, mean ± SEM dairy food
consumption was 2.2 ± 0.2 servings/d. At the end of the
MedDairy intervention, mean ± SEM dairy consumption was
3.0 ± 0.2 servings/d. A significant effect of the MedDairy
intervention led to a mean ± SEM increase of 1.0 ± 0.2 dairy
servings/d. There was no change in milk intake during either
intervention phase. However, there was a significant effect of the
MedDairy intervention on both yogurt and cheese intake.
The Australian calcium RDI for men aged >70 y and women
aged >50 y is 1300 mg/d. Mean ± SEM calcium intake
at baseline was 1011.7 ± 54.3 mg/d before the MedDairy
intervention and 1040.4 ± 50.8 mg/d before the LF intervention.
A significant effect of diet was observed for calcium intake
(milligrams per day), where intake increased significantly after
the MedDairy intervention. Before the MedDairy intervention,
85% of men and 19% of women met their calcium RDI (40%
of the total cohort). Before the LF intervention, 85% of men and
15% of women met their calcium RDI (40% of the total cohort).
At week 8 of the MedDairy intervention, 82% of men and 58%

of women met their calcium RDI (66% of the total cohort). At
week 8 of the LF intervention, 46% of men and 15% of women
met their calcium RDI (24% of the total cohort) (Figure 5).
Other nutrients
The remaining nutrients are presented in Table 5. The LF
diet led to significantly lower energy intake. Compared with the
LF intervention, energy from fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated
fat, and polyunsaturated fat was significantly higher during
the MedDairy diet, whereas energy from carbohydrate was
significantly lower. There was no difference between diets for
percentage energy from protein or alcohol.
Compared with the LF diet, the MedDairy intervention led
to significantly higher intakes of vitamin E, linoleic acid, and
α-linolenic acid and a significantly lower intake of folate. No
significant differences were observed for cholesterol, dietary
fiber, vitamin C, vitamin A, β-carotene, sodium, potassium, iron,
or zinc.
The MedDairy intervention led to a significantly higher
consumption of nuts and seeds, EVOO, and legumes and a lower
consumption of red meat and refined grains. No interactions were
observed for fruit, vegetables, or whole grains.

DISCUSSION
Before the MedDiet can be recommended at a population
level, it is necessary to ensure that it meets Western dietary
guidelines for essential nutrients. Current Australian Nutrient
Reference Values for calcium suggest an RDI of 1300 mg/d
for women aged ≥50 y and men aged ≥70 y (37). However,
previous studies indicate that a traditional MedDiet may not meet
these recommendations (1, 3).We have therefore conducted a
randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of modifying
a traditional MedDiet to meet the calcium needs of an Australian
population. Our findings suggest that the MedDairy intervention
is capable of improving cardiovascular health in a population at
risk of CVD.
During the MedDairy intervention, participants consumed a
mean of 1284 mg Ca/d, with two-thirds of participants meeting
their RDI specific to age and gender. In comparison, dairy food
and calcium intake decreased during the LF control intervention,
and only 24% of participants met their calcium RDI. This
was likely the result of efforts to reduce total fat intake. The
Australian Guide to Healthy Eating informed recommendations
for daily dairy servings during the MedDairy intervention. The
guide suggests that men consume 2.5 servings of dairy foods/d
until the age of 70 y and 3.5 servings/d thereafter. Women are
recommended to consume 2.5 servings/d until the age of 50 y
and 4 servings/d thereafter. While adhering to the MedDairy diet,
participants consumed a mean of 3 servings of dairy products/d.
Approximately 1 serving of dairy provides 300 mg Ca. Therefore
∼900 mg Ca was provided by dairy foods and the remaining
384 mg was provided by other sources (such as nuts, leafy green
vegetables, and fish). These data suggest that 3 servings of dairy

consumed within a MedDiet bring calcium intake closer to the
RDI for older Australians.
According
to the 14-item questionnaire, adherence to the
MedDiet increased during the MedDairy phase, from 5.4 points
to 12.9 points. To account for cultural differences in dietary
habits, the scoring scheme of the current study was adjusted
for an Australian population. For example, consumption of 3–
4 tablespoons of EVOO/d was necessary to score 1 point on
the original questionnaire but was deemed unrealistic for an
Australian sample (34). This criterion was therefore reduced to 1
tablespoon/d. It is possible that such modifications influenced the
results of the current study. For example, EVOO is considered to
be a beneficial bioactive ingredient of the MedDiet. By reducing

the required daily intake, potential benefits of EVOO may have
been mitigated.
A significant effect was observed for morning readings of
our primary outcome, home SBP. This finding is consistent with
recent MedDiet and dairy literature (3, 5, 6, 38, 39). The effect
of diet did not reach statistical significance for afternoon and
evening readings. In comparison to the current study, the MedLey
study found a significant effect of the MedDiet on total BP (3),
driven by an effect on morning and afternoon home BP. Although
the addition of dairy may have reduced effects on BP, it is possible
that our failure to capture a significant change in afternoon and
evening SBP was due to our comparatively short intervention
duration and limited sample size.
Our analyses also indicate a significant effect of the MedDairy
intervention on clinic SBP. Clinic SBP was taken between 0800
and 0930, supporting the effect of the diet on morning home
SBP. Due to the characteristics of a clinical environment, clinic
BP measurement can induce a reactionary stress response. As
a result, clinic BP is often overestimated and may be less
reliable than home BP (40, 41). In the current study, clinic SBP
readings were markedly higher than home SBP readings at the
baseline of each dietary intervention and at week 8 of the LF
intervention (mean difference: 5 mm Hg). However, at week 8 of
the MedDairy intervention, clinic and home SBP were within 1.3
mm Hg. This may indicate a true reduction in BP or BP reactivity.
A significant effect of diet was observed for afternoon HR,
which decreased by 1.9 beats/min after the MedDairy interven-
tion and increased by 1.4 beats/min after the LF intervention. The
decrease in afternoon readings after the MedDairy intervention is
consistent with previous cross-sectional and longitudinal studies
associating the MedDiet with lower HR (42). Because elevated
HR is an established predictor of cardiovascular mortality (43),
the effect of the MedDairy intervention on afternoon HR is
clinically relevant.
Significant effects of the MedDairy intervention were also
observed for variables of blood lipids, including total triglyc-
erides, HDL cholesterol, and the ratio of total cholesterol
to HDL cholesterol. Previous investigations of the MedDiet
have reported similar improvements in lipid profiles (4, 5).
Furthermore, a recent review of the effects of dairy foods on LDL-
cholesterol concentrations indicates a positive benefit of milk and
cheese. Our results support these findings and indicate that dairy
consumed within a MedDiet pattern can lead to positive effects
on lipid profiles, even over a short intervention period.
The current study did not observe significant effects of diet for
glucose, insulin, or indicators of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR),

insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S), β-cell function (HOMA-B), or

S, HOMA-B, HOMA-IR, and CRP were within recommended
ranges (44). It is therefore not surprising that neither diet led
to a significant effect on these markers. Furthermore, despite
improvements in BP and lipid profiles after the MedDairy
intervention, the current study did not observe significant change
in 10-y absolute CVD risk, as measured by the FRS.

these differences were driven by the reduction in energy intake
during the LF diet.
The current study was subject to a number of limitations.
First, the current study aimed to evaluate the benefits of the
MedDairy intervention compared with current best practice in
dietetics in Australia. At the time of study conception, this was
considered to be the LF diet. However, the use of an LF control
diet may limit the generalizability of our results, as well as our
capacity to evaluate the benefits of adding dairy to a traditional
MedDiet. Regarding the MedDairy intervention, it is possible that
recommendations for EVOO consumption during the MedDairy
intervention were not reflective of a traditional MedDiet and
therefore mitigated potential cardiovascular effects. However,
the MedLey trial used the same dietary recommendation for
EVOO and found significant improvements in BP and endothelial
function (3). Furthermore, our data indicate that participants
consumed a mean of 2.6 tablepoons of EVOO each day,
increasing their baseline consumption by 400%.
It is possible that the addition of dairy diluted potential
health benefits of the MedDiet. Indeed, dairy is not a traditional
component of the MedDiet, and dairy intake receives a negative
score in the 9-point MedDiet score developed by Trichopoulou
et al. (7). Notably, Trichopoulou et al. reported that dairy
intake was associated with a 4% increase in hazard of death
for every 20-g increase in daily consumption. However, recent
studies report positive relations between dairy intake and
markers of cardiovascular health (22, 45), whereas a meta-
analysis of prospective studies reported no associations of total
dairy consumption with mortality, CVD, or coronary artery
disease (24).
The calculation of sample size was based on previous research
and attempted to find a clinically meaningful change in BP of 2.5
mm Hg. However, given the short time frame, the expectation
of such an effect size may have been unrealistic. Therefore, the
current study may have been underpowered to detect smaller,
non–clinically significant effects in BP. Although previous
research indicates that 8 wk is adequate to observe changes
in cardiovascular outcomes, a longer intervention may have
produced larger effects. Moreover, our ability to detect significant
changes in home SBP may have been limited by our eligibility
criterion of SBP ≥120 mm Hg. Although SBP >120 mm Hg
is considered elevated and responsive to intervention, many
participants reported a home SBP lower than their screening SBP,
which may have been unlikely to change significantly in response
to a dietary intervention.
Despite randomization, mean home SBP was 4.1 mm Hg
higher for the MedDairy diet than for the LF diet at baseline.
Randomization may have ensured overall balance between the
2 groups in terms of observed and unobserved confounders.
However, the disparity in mean home SBP between the 2 groups
was reversed at the beginning of the second intervention period,
indicating the possibility of a significant carryover effect if
the observed effects for SBP were real. To help address this,
we allowed the estimated intervention effect for MedDairy to
vary for the 2 intervention periods by including a Visit ×
Period interaction term in the analysis of home SBP. Despite
this adjustment in our analysis, there remains the possibility
of underlying differences between the 2 groups, which could
potentially bias our estimates.
Finally, due to the nature of the current study, blinding of both
participants and researchers was neither practical nor possible.
As such, the potential for bias related to expectations must be
considered when interpreting results.
The current study has achieved a number of significant and
clinically relevant findings regarding the benefits of a MedDiet
with adequate servings of dairy to meet the calcium needs of
Australians. Namely, we have shown that following a MedDiet
with 3–4 daily servings of dairy for 8 wk is feasible and
achievable for an Australian population. Furthermore, a MedDiet
with 3 daily servings of dairy is capable of meeting the Australian
RDI for calcium while improving risk factors for CVD, including
BP, lipid profiles, and HR. These findings are of particular interest
to health care professionals who may wish to recommend the
MedDiet to older Australians for improvement in cardiovascular
health while ensuring adequate calcium intake for the prevention
of osteoporosis.
