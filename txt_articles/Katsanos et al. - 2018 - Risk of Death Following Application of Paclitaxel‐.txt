Background-—Several
randomized
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
have
already
shown
that
paclitaxel-coated
balloons
and
stents significantly reduce the rates of vessel restenosis and target lesion revascularization after lower extremity
interventions.
Methods and Results-—A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs investigating paclitaxel-coated devices in the femoral and/
or popliteal arteries was performed. The primary safety measure was all-cause patient death. Risk ratios and risk differences were
pooled with a random effects model. In all, 28 RCTs with 4663 patients (89% intermittent claudication) were analyzed. All-cause
patient death at 1 year (28 RCTs with 4432 cases) was similar between paclitaxel-coated devices and control arms (2.3% versus
2.3% crude risk of death; risk ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.72–1.61). All-cause death at 2 years (12 RCTs with 2316 cases) was
significantly increased in the case of paclitaxel versus control (7.2% versus 3.8% crude risk of death; risk ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.15–
2.47; —number-needed-to-harm, 29 patients [95% CI, 19–59]). All-cause death up to 5 years (3 RCTs with 863 cases) increased
further in the case of paclitaxel (14.7% versus 8.1% crude risk of death; risk ratio, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.27–2.93; —number-needed-to-
harm, 14 patients [95% CI, 9–32]). Meta-regression showed a significant relationship between exposure to paclitaxel (dose-time
product) and absolute risk of death (0.4�0.1% excess risk of death per paclitaxel mg-year; P<0.001). Trial sequential analysis
excluded false-positive findings with 99% certainty (2-sided a, 1.0%).
Conclusions-—There is increased risk of death following application of paclitaxel-coated balloons and stents in the femoropopliteal
artery of the lower limbs. Further investigations are urgently warranted.

T
o date, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and
stenting have developed to the mainstream treatment
of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease with constantly
increasing numbers of procedures worldwide.1,2 The femor-
opopliteal artery is the most common site of involvement in
atherosclerosis of the lower limb and is typically characterized
by multilevel steno-occlusive disease, often complex calcified
morphology,
and
aggressive
postangioplasty
neointimal
hyperplasia associated with high rates of early vessel
restenosis and failure.3 Drug-eluting stents (DESs) and drug-
coated balloons (DCBs) have been extensively investigated as
a potential solution to inhibit vessel restenosis and improve
clinical outcomes after endovascular revascularization of the
femoropopliteal artery.4

SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 2, 2019
 paclitaxel has emerged as the single potent and proven
antirestenotic agent for the infrainguinal vessels.3–5 Recent
meta-analyses of several RCTs with low risk of bias have
amassed strong evidence about the clinical effectiveness of
paclitaxel DES and DCB in significantly reducing restenosis
and thereby reducing the risk of recurrent limb ischemia and
target lesion/limb revascularization.4,6,7 Consequently, after
extensive preclinical testing and having demonstrated strong
clinical efficacy combined with a good safety profile, a number
of paclitaxel DES and DCB devices have gradually received
the CE mark and Food and Drug Administration approval for
use in the femoropopliteal segment of the leg.
However, the INPACT-DEEP (Study of IN.PACT Amphir-
ionTM Drug Eluting
Balloon
vs. Standard
PTA for
the
Treatment of
Below
the
Knee
Critical
Limb
Ischemia)
randomized study has shown higher rates of major ampu-
tations in the active paclitaxel arm compared with control.8
In addition, a couple of RCTs with longer-term follow-up have
shown hints of increased late patient mortality with the use
of paclitaxel DESs9 or DCBs.10,11 In the absence of obvious
causal links, these findings have been dismissed by expert
review panels as statistical artifacts or anomalies, and both
devices are currently under clinical use with extended on
label indications. Moreover, coronary drug-eluting stents
have been long incriminated for late stent thrombosis with
an associated risk of death.12 Hence, we conducted an
updated systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of
RCTs investigating paclitaxel-coated balloons and stents in
the femoropopliteal artery, in order to analyze the early and
late risk of death associated with these novel endovascular
technologies that deliver paclitaxel to the vessel wall of the
lower limbs.
Material and Methods
Literature Search
The authors declare that all supporting data are available within
the tables, figures, and supplemental material of the present
article. This systematic review has been registered in the
PROSPERO public database (CRD42018099447; http://www.c
rd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO). We performed electronic searches
of PubMed (Medline), EMBASE (Excerpta Medical Database),
AMED (Allied and Complementary medicine Database), Scopus,
CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials),
archived online content, public filings of regulatory bodies (Food
and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency) and
published abstracts from international vascular meetings for
eligibleRCTs.Therewerenorestrictionsonpublicationlanguage,
publication date, or publication status. The literature was
screened for randomized studies investigating paclitaxel-coated
DESs or DCBs in the femoropopliteal artery of the lower limbs.
Search terms included Cochrane, femoral artery, popliteal artery,
femoropopliteal artery, late lumen loss, restenosis, target lesion
revascularization, peripheral angioplasty, stent, randomized,
balloon angioplasty, paclitaxel-eluting balloons, paclitaxel-coated
balloons, paclitaxel-eluting stents, paclitaxel-coated stents, pacli-
taxel-eluting stents,drug-coatedballoons,anddrug-eluting stents,
as well as the corresponding Medical Subjects Headings with
Boolean syntax (ie, the logic terms AND and/or OR). The
literature search was last updated in August 2018. Trials were
considered for inclusion in the present meta�analysis if they
fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: (1) Randomized con-
trolled study design, (2) investigation of a paclitaxel-coated/
paclitaxel-eluting stent or balloon in the femoropopliteal artery,
(3) patient population with peripheral arterial disease of the
femoral and/or popliteal artery and symptoms of intermittent
claudication and/or critical limb ischemia, (4) clinical follow-up
of at least 1 year available.
Evaluation of the quality and risk of bias of the selected
RCTs was performed independently by two of the authors
(K.K., D.K.) using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for
assessing risk of bias,13 which evaluates 7 key design items
of an RCT: (1) random sequence generation, (2) allocation
concealment, (3) blinding of participants and personnel,
(4) blinding of outcome assessment, (5) incomplete outcome
data, (6) selective outcome reporting, and (7) other potential
sources of bias. Each aforementioned domain was evaluated
as high, low, or unclear risk of bias according to Cochrane.
Disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Data Extraction and Outcome Measures
The trial selection process complied with the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses

Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• There is strong evidence from statistical inference that the
risk of death is significantly increased beyond the first year
following application of paclitaxel-coated balloons and
stents in the femoropopliteal artery of the leg in patients
with intermittent claudication.
• Actual causes remain unknown and further clinical investi-
gations are urgently warranted.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Collection and reporting of longer-term follow-up (beyond
1 year) in case of all commercial clinical studies is
recommended to confirm or refute the present findings.
• Pharmacological studies may also help understand the
potential biological mechanisms behind the association of
paclitaxel in the lower limbs and patient mortality.

 also queried for potential study candidates. Three of the
authors (K.K., S.S., and P.K.) selected the trials to be included in
further quantitative synthesis and independently extracted
relevant raw data in duplicate. Information was abstracted from
the main text and tables of published manuscripts or other
archived online material as cited. Again, any disagreements
were resolved by consensus among the investigators. Data
extracted from each RCT included baseline patient demograph-
ics, procedural variables, follow-up time period, prescribed
antiplatelet therapy, and outcome data on patient mortality
during different time periods. Our meta-analysis concentrated
only on patient mortality because metrics of clinical effective-
ness have been previously thoroughly reported.4,15 The
outcome measure was set at all-cause patient death and
adjudicated/reported as such in the studies. All-cause patient
death was analyzed at different time points following paclitaxel-
coated balloon and/or stent angioplasty of the leg.
Statistical Methods
Quantitative synthesis of the included RCTs was performed in
R language environment (version 3.4.1) with the “meta”
package (version 4.9-2). Categorical variables were expressed
as counts and percentages, and continuous variables as
means � SD if normally distributed. Patient mortality rates
were pooled with a random effects model to account for any
clinical and study design heterogeneity. Summary statistics
were expressed both as risk ratios and risk differences and
the associated 95% CI. To help clinical judgment, the number-
needed-to-harm (NNH) with corresponding 95% CIs were also
calculated in cases of statistical significance. Publication bias
was assessed (1) qualitatively by visual inspection of inverted
funnel plot asymmetry, and (2) quantitatively with the
Horbold-Egger test.16
Prespecified sensitivity and subgroup analyses were per-
formed to test the validity and stability of the results.
Analyses included fixed versus random effects models,
bayesian models to address rare events, omission of one
study at a time (leave-one-out meta-analysis), and subgroups
of
different
paclitaxel
dosages.
Meta-regression
was
employed to further explore the relationship of treatment
effects and exposure to paclitaxel. Trial sequential analysis
(TSA, Copenhagen Trial Unit) was further used to adjust for
between-trial diversity and reduce the risk of false-positive
findings. TSA was applied to ensure enough statistical power
to detect the relevant effect size, better control type I and II
errors, and calculate the diversity-adjusted information size in
the context of the present meta-analysis.17 We also con-
ducted sensitivity analyses on different TSA settings (Trial
Sequential Analysis Version 0.9.5.5, Copenhagen Trial Unit,
Centre for Clinical Intervention Research, Rigshospitalet,
2016). The level of statistical significance was set at a=0.05.
Results
Included RCTs
The
literature
search
yielded
386
articles
eligible
for
potential inclusion based on their title and content of
abstract. Of those, 48 items were found to be relevant and
were included in further full-text analysis. Another 20
articles were excluded because they did not meet the
predefined inclusion criteria. In all, 28 RCTs with 4663
patients were finally included in the present meta-analysis
(Figure S1). Full citation information for all studies, as well
as the properties of the 12 different devices tested that
were coated with 2.0-, 3.0- or 3.5-lg/mm2 paclitaxel, are
outlined in Tables S1 and S2. There were 4 RCTs with a
paclitaxel DES9,18–22 and 24 RCTs testing different paclitaxel
DCB devices. Out of the 24 DCB studies, 16 involved sole
application of a paclitaxel-coated balloon (versus balloon
PTA)23–48; 4 combined the paclitaxel balloon with bare metal
stent (versus PTA and BMS)49–52; and 3 studies investigated
use of a DCB for the treatment of in-stent restenosis (versus
PTA).53–55 Baseline patient demographics and morphologic
lesion variables were largely homogeneously distributed
across all studies and in line with previous meta-analyses.
The design characteristics of the 28 selected RCTs are
shown in Table 1.
Briefly, paclitaxel-coated balloons and stents were used
primarily for the treatment of short-distance intermittent
claudication
(n=4133
of
4663
subjects;
89%)
in
the
majority of the study population and infrequently for a
critical limb ischemia indication (n=530). A detailed over-
view
of
baseline
patient
and
lesion
characteristics
is
provided in Table S3 for all included studies. Overall,
approximately two thirds of the patients were men; the
mean age ranged from 67 to 76 years; and there was a
high incidence of smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia
across all studies. The crude incidence of diabetes mellitus
ranged from 21% to 77%. A wide range of intermediate to
higher-length lesions was enlisted. With few exceptions,
most protocols recommended a short period of 1 to
3 months of dual antiplatelet therapy. The median RCT
follow-up period was 2 years (range, 1–5 years). Fifteen
studies had 1 year, 10 studies had 2 years, 1 study had
4 years, and 2 studies had 5 years of clinical follow-up
available (Table 1). A majority of the RCTs were executed
as randomized multicenter studies except for 3 single-
center studies and 3 dual-center studies. Randomization
and allocation concealment were performed adequately and
methodological quality was high for all trials with the
exception of an inherently high risk of performance bias in
all 28 RCTs because of the universal absence of systematic
blinding of the operators during application of the devices
(Figure S2).

*The design of the ZILVER PTX study included a primary randomization (optimal PTA vs primary DES) and a secondary randomization in the case of PTA failure (bailout BMS vs bail-out DES)—results of the 2 randomization levels were pooled
for the purposes of the present meta-analysis. For the Thunder trial (3-arm trial), the arm of paclitaxel dissolved in the contrast medium was excluded. For the ISAR-STATH trial (3-arm trial), the arm of directional atherectomy was excluded
from the present analysis. For the DEBATE in SFA trial, the 2 BMS arms (with or without cilostazol) were pooled against the ZILVER PTX arm. For the DEBELLUM trial, only femoropopliteal lesions were analyzed. In the LEVANT I trial,
randomization between plain BA and PCB was performed after provisional stent placement in a quarter of the cases (26 of 101). In the RAPID study, the Supera biomimetic nitinol stent was used in both arms. Data extraction was
supplemented by online archived material from international meetings or regulatory authority filings as cited (US Food and Drug Administration—Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency).

Deaths After Paclitaxel Interventions in the Leg
Katsanos et al
SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 2, 2019
 All-Cause Death at 1 Year
All-cause patient death up to 1 year was reported by all
included RCTs for a total of 4432 subjects. There was good
evidence that the pooled risk of death did not differ
significantly between the active use of paclitaxel-coated
balloons or stents versus the control arms. There were 58
deaths out of 2506 patients in the paclitaxel arms (2.3% crude
risk of death) compared with 45 deaths in 1926 patients in
the control arms (2.3% crude risk of death) with a calculated
pooled risk ratio of 1.08 (95% CI, 0.72–1.61; Figure 1). There
was no statistically significant heterogeneity between studies
(P=0.98).
All-Cause Death at 2 Years
In all, 12 studies out of the 28 RCTs reported the incidence of
all-cause patient death up to 2 years in a total of 2316
patients. There was good evidence that application of
paclitaxel-coated devices in the femoropopliteal artery was
related to significantly increased risk of death. There were
101 deaths out of 1397 patients in the paclitaxel arms (7.2%
crude risk of death) compared with 35 deaths in 919 patients
in the control arms (3.8% crude risk of death) with a
calculated risk ratio of 1.68 (95% CI, 1.15–2.47). Absolute
risk difference was 3.5% (95% CI, 1.7–5.3%) with a corre-
sponding NNH of 29 patients (95% CI, 19–59). There was no
statistically
significant
heterogeneity
between
studies
(P=0.80; Figure 2).
All-Cause Death Up to 5 Years

 risk of death) versus 27 deaths out of 334 cases in the control
(8.1% crude risk of death) with a pooled risk ratio of 1.93 (95%
CI, 1.27–2.93). Absolute risk difference was 7.2% (95% CI,
3.1–11.3%) and NNH was 14 patients (95% CI, 9–32). There
was no statistically significant heterogeneity between studies
(P=0.92; Figure 3).
Sensitivity and Subgroup Analyses
There was no visual asymmetry of the respective funnel
plots to suggest publication bias at 1 year (Horbold-Egger
test, 0.27; P=0.66), 2 years (Horbold-Egger test, 0.47;
P=0.55), or 4 to 5 years of follow-up (Horbold-Egger test,
�0.43; P=0.11; Figure S3). We opted to report summary
estimates from a frequentist random effects model to
account for conceptual and study design differences among
different RCTs. The randomized studies included here tested
numerous designs of paclitaxel-coated devices with variable
drug dosages and different drug excipients in slightly
different patient populations. Hence, a different, but similar
treatment effect was assumed as the basis for the random
effects modeling.58 In addition, different methods of anal-
yses (with or without continuity correction and Bayesian
methods) were employed to interrogate potential bias and
uncertainty arising from meta-analysis of low event rates as
recommended
elsewhere.59
Bayesian
methods
generally
increased the size of treatment effect (Table S4). The
pooled point estimates remained consistent across sensi-
tivity and subgroup analyses with some variation in the
magnitude of effect size. There were also differences in the
estimated long-term risk of death when examining different
paclitaxel doses, although those results are underpowered,
with variable follow-up periods, and informed by few studies
in each case (Table 2).

 Trial Sequential Analysis
TSA was performed to test availability of adequate patient
sample size and adjust positive findings after the first year in
order to minimize the risk of statistical errors because none of
the included studies were designed or powered to investigate
differences in patient mortality. The information size required
for a valid meta-analysis may be assumed to be at least as
large as the sample size of a single well-powered RCT
designed to confirm or reject the null hypothesis.60 TSA
included 13 RCTs with clinical follow-up >1 year (weighted
mean follow-up of 3 years; range, 2–5 years) from 2401
cases in total. TSA is illustrated in Figure 4, which shows the
cumulative curve of the Z score statistic and the O’Brien-
Fleming trial sequential monitoring boundaries to control
statistical errors against the available sample size. Clearly, the
cumulative Z curve crosses the external alpha-spending
boundaries, and the required information size (cumulative
patient sample) has been achieved. Using a type II error
threshold of b=10% (power 90%) and by varying the threshold
of type I error (alpha range, 1–5%), TSA confirmed accumu-
lation of adequate information size to refute a type I error (ie,
false-positive results) with up to 99% certainty (two-sided a,
1.0%).
Meta-Regression Analysis
In line with Bradford Hill’s criteria61 for establishing epidemi-
ological evidence for causation, we explored presence of a
biological gradient, that is, whether greater exposure leads to
greater incidence of the effect. To that end, we performed
meta-regression of the absolute risk difference of all-cause
death against exposure to paclitaxel in all 28 RCTs. Consid-
ering that crystalline paclitaxel delivered by paclitaxel-coated
devices has a half-life of weeks to months,62–64 we calculated
exposure to paclitaxel as the dose-time product after
treatment. To account for nominal device dose and treated
vessel surface area, the following equation was used for
calculation of paclitaxel dose-time product expressed in
milligram-years for each individual study (i):
Exposurei ¼ Dosei � ðp � Di � LengthiÞ � Timei
where, Dosei is the nominal paclitaxel dose loaded on the
balloon or stent (lg/mm2), Di is the reference vessel diameter
(mm), Lengthi is the treated lesion length (mm), and Timei
indicates the available follow-up time period (years). Random
effects meta-regression identified a highly significant associ-
ation between paclitaxel dose-time product and absolute risk
of death; there was a 0.4�0.1% excess risk of death for every
paclitaxel milligram-year (95% CI, 0.1–0.6%; P<0.001; Fig-
ure 5). The result was stable on a resampling permutation test
(1000 iterations; P=0.013).
Discussion
Paclitaxel-coated balloon and stents have emerged as the
most promising strategy for the inhibition of neointimal
hyperplasia following angioplasty of the femoropopliteal artery
of the leg. Several randomized controlled studies have already
demonstrated
strong
evidence
of
clinical
effectiveness
enrolling predominantly patients suffering from intermittent
claudication (�90% of the sample size).3,4 Following the
progressive release of longer-term clinical outcomes, a
comprehensive updated systematic review and meta-analysis
was undertaken to compare the all-cause patient mortality
associated with the use of those devices. Overall, there was
good evidence that all-cause death at 1 year was equivalent
between paclitaxel and control arms. However, the risk of all-
cause death appeared to increase dramatically after the first
year in the case of paclitaxel arms. Synthesis of study-level
outcomes at 2 years documented a significant 68% relative
risk increase of all-cause death with a corresponding NNH of
29 patients. Risk of death increased further in the long-term
analysis (at 5 years) with a 93% relative risk increase and an
NNH of 14. Overall, the present statistical inference appeared
to be credible and stable on various sensitivity tests.
Furthermore, we found neither any statistical heterogeneity

 nor any major diversity between the included studies. We
employed trial sequential analysis to address potential
random sampling errors and other unknown bias because of
the fact that none of the present studies was designed or
adequately powered to explore the outcome of patient
mortality. Interestingly, TSA meta-analysis powered at 90%
has shown accumulation of adequate information size to
exclude false-positive findings (type I error)
with 99%
certainty.
The authors consider the herein reported findings of
particular concern because most of the interrogated devices
have already received clearance by regulatory authorities
and are currently under routine clinical use. The potential
causes of this alarming late increased incidence of death
remain unknown. Experience with paclitaxel-coated devices
has been previously limited to the coronary TAXUS stents
(Boston
Scientific,
Marlborough,
MA),
which
allow
for
prolonged release of paclitaxel from a polymer-based stent
coating. Of note, long-term results of the safety of the
TAXUS paclitaxel stent in the heart (patient-level analysis of
2797 randomized patients receiving TAXUS versus bare
stents) have long shown a significant increase of long-term
death and myocardial infarction after 1 year following
implantation (6.7% versus 4.5%, P<0.01).65 Likewise, long-
term results from the SYNTAX (TAXUS Drug-Eluting Stent
Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for the Treatment of
Narrowed Arteries) study (1800 patients with complex
coronary artery disease randomized between TAXUS pacli-
taxel stent and coronary artery bypass surgery) have shown
a significantly higher cardiovascular mortality up to 5 years
in the case of paclitaxel coronary interventions compared
with bypass grafting (9.6% versus 5.6%; P=0.008) to be
explained mostly by late myocardial infarctions. The latter
was further confirmed in the nested nonrandomized SYNTAX
registries extending to involve both a cardiovascular (12.1%
versus 4.7%) and an inexplicable noncardiovascular (14.9%
versus
5.3%)
mortality
difference.66
Consequently,
the
coronary field has gradually moved away from paclitaxel
DES also because of the well-recognized issues of vessel
wall tissue inflammation, aneurysm formation, and late stent
thrombosis.62,63
In addition, most drug-coated balloons and stents for the
femoropopliteal artery contain at least an order of magnitude
higher payload of paclitaxel in comparison with paclitaxel-
eluting coronary stents (a 3.5932 mm coronary TAXUS stent
contains around 200 lg paclitaxel compared with around
1.2 mg for the ZILVER-PTX 6.09120 stent, 4.5 mg for the
LUTONIX 6.09120 drug-coated balloon and 8.5 mg for the
IN.PACT 6.09120 balloon). From a pharmacological view-
point, paclitaxel-coated balloons and stents have been
engineered to deliver prolonged levels of paclitaxel into the
vessel tissues so as to inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation
and avert vessel restenosis. Paclitaxel is a lipophilic cytotoxic
agent that blocks the cell cycle during mitosis by interfering
with the spindle disassembly.67 To enable sustained tissue
bioavailability without a polymer, most modern balloons and
stents (Table S2) are coated with a mostly solid crystalline
form of paclitaxel combined with a unique paclitaxel spacer or

 excipient that modulates drug transfer into the vessel wall.5,68
Preclinical animal studies have shown prolonged vessel wall
retention of paclitaxel in the iliofemoral arteries after DES- or
DCB-mediated delivery with therapeutic tissue levels (>1 ng/
mg) maintained up to 2 months after delivery.63,69–71
The authors postulate that late paclitaxel toxicity may be
the reason for the observed increased death rate. Contrary to
solvent-based (eg, cremophor) intravenous paclitaxel used in
cancer chemotherapy that has a half-life of around 6 hours,72
paclitaxel crystals loaded on DCB or DES for the peripheral
arteries have a half-life of weeks to months, depending on
the exact chemical properties of the applied paclitaxel
formulation.62–64
Increased
paclitaxel
crystallinity
helps
achieve higher tissue uptake and retention and improved
biologic effect, however, at the expense of microparticle
formation that may embolize in the downstream systemic
circulation.63 Worrisome rates
of potential downstream
embolization of the skeletal muscles of the lower limbs have
been confirmed on the bench and animal studies62,73 and are
postulated to be responsible for the significantly higher rates
of major amputations noted in the active paclitaxel arm of the
randomized INPACT-DEEP study.8,71 Preclinical follow-up
studies have shown that in the case of paclitaxel-coated
balloons, �1% to 10% of the paclitaxel dose gets transferred
into the target vessel wall, and as much as 90% (or as much as
8.5 mg of paclitaxel on a 6.09120 mm 3.5 lg/mm2 device)
gets
lost
into
the
systemic
circulation
with
unknown
consequences.64,74 Rates of distal paclitaxel embolization, if
any, in the case of paclitaxel DES remain unknown.70
Within the modern epidemiologic framework of structural
causal modeling developed by Judea Pearl,75,76 the present
work shows strong signals of biomedical causality between
paclitaxel and mortality within multiple controlled randomized
trials. According to the more traditional Bradford Hill criteria61
for establishing a causal relationship between a presumed
cause and an observed health effect, the present work has
shown evidence of strength, consistency, temporality, and
biological gradient. Risk of death was identical at 1 year but
more than doubled during the second year following inter-
vention. Twelve of 13 studies showed increased mortality
between 1 and 2 years after intervention. In addition, a
significant relationship between dose-time exposure to pacli-
taxel and incidence of deaths was identified; risk of death
increased by 0.4�0.1% per paclitaxel milligram-year. Inter-
estingly, the risk of death beyond 1 year also seemed to vary
among different paclitaxel dosages, being significantly higher
in the 3.5 lg/mm2 devices compared with the lower-dose
devices (Table 2). Still, the present meta-analysis is under-
powered to discern outcome differences between the differ-
ent paclitaxel devices as some devices are supported by a
single trial and follow-up beyond 2 years is missing in most
cases. The authors would therefore encourage collection of
longer-term follow-up (beyond 1 year) in case of all studies to
help confirm or refute the present findings.
Two-year clinical outcomes from large-scale phase IV
registries have been recently released for 2 DCB and 1 DES
device in the femoropopliteal artery. The ZILVER-PTX post-
market single-arm DES surveillance registry reported a 2.6%
annualized risk of death (41 of 787 subjects at 2 years),19 the
Lutonix Global SFA registry stated a 3.0% risk (38 of 637 died
at 2 years),77 and the IN.PACT Global postmarket DCB study a
3.5% annualized risk of death (89 of 1269 at 2 years).78 The

 aforementioned rates of patient death appear to be consistent
with an annualized 3.1% incidence of death in the case of
paclitaxel DES and DCB documented in the present meta-
analysis (compared with 1.9% in the control angioplasty
arms). Population-based contemporary series of intermittent
claudication that constituted 89% of the patient population
included here have documented a 1.0% to 2.0% annual
mortality rate,79–81 which is consistent with the 1.9%
incidence of all-cause death in the control arms of the
current analysis.
The present meta-analysis has several limitations. First, we
excluded studies with DCB or DES in the below-knee
infrapopliteal arteries as they pertain to a distinctively
different patient population mostly with critical limb ischemia
associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Second,
some study protocols did not include an independent blinded
clinical events committee for event adjudication, and nearly
universally a single-blind or open-label study design was
applied that may have introduced detection or performance
bias,
respectively.
Third,
unfortunately
and
with
few
exceptions,9,10,19,82 most studies did not report the actual
causes of deaths to help infer potential causal links with
paclitaxel use. An association of paclitaxel with more
cardiovascular deaths, but also of infectious, gastrointestinal,
and pulmonary origin, was noted in the INPACT SFA
(Randomized Trial of IN.PACT AdmiralTM Drug Coated Balloon
vs Standard PTA for the Treatment of SFA and Proximal
Popliteal Arterial Disease) and ZILVER PTX (Evaluation of the
Zilver PTX Drug-Eluting Peripheral Stent) studies (Table 3).
Although baseline demographics were generally well bal-
anced, in a few studies a numerically greater incidence of
patient comorbidities—eg, smoking, hyperlipidemia, hyper-
tension, or diabetes mellitus—were noted in the paclitaxel
arms, for example, in the ZILVER PTX study.
Hence,
undetected sources of heterogeneity could not be explored
in depth in the absence of individual patient data. Finally, we
could not establish a plausible mechanism between paclitaxel
and deaths, but as Sir Bradford Hill noted, knowledge of the
mechanism may be limited by current knowledge.61
In conclusion, there seems to be an increased long-term
risk of death beyond the first year following femoropopliteal
application of paclitaxel-coated balloons and stents in the
lower limbs. Actual causes for this serious late side effect
remain unknown, and further investigations with longer-term
follow-up are urgently warranted.

Nominal paclitaxel dose is expressed in micrograms/mm2 (μg/mm2). Based on the relevant FDA 
submission, dose is around (3.7μg/mm2) for the IN.PACT drug-coated balloon. In case of the ZILVER-
PTX drug-coated stent, nominal paclitaxel dose adjusted for corresponding vessel surface area is 
actually 0.37μg/mm2 based on corresponding FDA filing data. The latter doses were used for 
calculation of paclitaxel dose for the purposes of meta-regression analysis.
