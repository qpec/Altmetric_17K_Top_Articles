Abstract
Even children attending the same primary school and taught by the same teacher differ greatly in 
their performance. In the Netherlands, performance at the end of primary school determines the 
enrollment in a particular level of secondary education. Identifying the impact of genes and the 
environment on individual differences in educational achievement between children is important. 
The Netherlands Twin Register has collected data on scores of tests used in primary school (ages 6 
to 12) to monitor a child’s educational progress in four domains, i.e. arithmetic, word reading, 
reading comprehension and spelling (1058 MZ and 1734 DZ twin pairs), and of a final test (2451 
MZ and 4569 DZ twin pairs) in a large Dutch cohort. In general, individual differences in 
educational achievement were to a large extent due to genes and the influence of the family 
environment was negligible. Moreover, there is no evidence for gender differences in the 
underlying etiology.

1 Introduction
Children differ in their ability to learn the subject material that is taught at school. Some 
master basic skills, such as reading and arithmetic, and pick up knowledge about science, 
history and biology much faster than their peers. Low educational achievement is associated 
with continued low achievement, school dropout and delinquency (Moilanen, Shaw, & 
Maxwell, 2010). General cognitive ability is the most important predictor of educational 
achievement (Deary, Strand, Smith, & Fernandes, 2007) and explains about half of the 
variation (Frey & Detterman, 2004). Most research on educational achievement of children 
has focused on environmental factors, such as socioeconomic status (SES) of the parents and 
school characteristics, and on differences between groups of children, for example boys and

 girls (OECD, 2010). However, even children attending the same school and taught by the 
same teacher differ greatly in their performance at school. It may be less relevant to look at 
group differences when differences within a group are much larger. Causes for individual 
differences between children do not necessarily have to be the same as for average 
differences between groups. The main reason for mean differences in educational 
achievement between boys and girls might be environmental whereas the cause for 
differences in performance between individual children may be largely genetic in nature.
Genetic research can address questions about the causes of individual differences among 
children and disentangle the underlying etiology, i.e. the extent to which the differences in 
educational achievement between children are explained by their genes or by the 
environment (Boomsma, 2013; Plomin, Defries, McClearn, & McGuffin, 2008). One of the 
most often used designs in behavior genetics is the twin study, which is based on the 
difference in genetic relatedness between identical or monozygotic (MZ) and fraternal or 
dizygotic (DZ) twins. Monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs are genetically (nearly) identical while 
dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs share approximately 50 per cent of their segregating genes. If the 
larger genetic resemblance of MZ twin pairs is mirrored in a larger resemblance for a 
phenotype the phenotype is being influenced by genetic effects. Genetic effects are the sum 
of the effects of all additive genetic variants with an influence on educational achievement. 
When the correlation between MZ twin pairs is higher than between DZ twin pairs, this 
constitutes evidence for the influence of genetic effects. Environmental effects often are 
distinguished into common or shared environmental and unique or non-shared 
environmental effects. Common environmental effects are influences that are shared 
between twins or siblings who grow up in the same family and enhance their similarity 
beyond the similarity due to shared genes. There are other effects that also make offspring 
from the same parents more similar, including the effects of assortative mating, the similarity 
between spouses, which in the classical twin design will also be detected as common 
environmental effects (Evans, Gillespie & Martin, 2002). When the correlation between DZ 
twin pairs is more than half the correlation between MZ twin pairs there is an indication for 
the influence of the common environment. Unique environmental effects are influences that 
are not shared between twins, and make children less similar. When the correlation between 
MZ twin pairs is not equal to unity the unique environment has an influence. The unique 
environmental effects also include measurement error.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that genetic effects have a substantial influence on 
differences between children in general cognitive ability. General cognitive ability is often 
seen as an aptitude while reading, mathematics and spelling are taught at school and 
perceived as the outcome of education. Hence, it seems reasonable to expect that heritability 
of educational achievement is lower than the heritability of general cognitive ability. 
However, a recent study has shown that the opposite was true for primary school children in 
the United Kingdom (UK). Literacy and numeracy were significantly more heritable than 
general cognitive ability at ages 7 and 9, but no longer at age 12 (Kovas et al., 2013). 
Heritability of general cognitive ability also increases in the Netherlands from low (20%) to 
moderate (50%) (Bartels, Rietveld, van Baal, & Boomsma, 2002) during primary school, to 
high (65%) in adolescence (Van Soelen et al., 2011) while heritability of educational 
achievement is already high at the start of primary school (70%) (Calvin et al., 2012) and 
de Zeeuw et al.

 remains the same until the end of primary school (60%) (Bartels et al., 2002). It has been 
proposed that the equal opportunities in the relatively homogenous education environment 
provided in Western societies acts to reduce environmental variation, making differences in 
educational achievement between children to a greater extent due to genetic differences 
(Kovas et al., 2013).
Twin studies have mainly focused on the educational domain of reading and, more recently, 
mathematics, while less is known about the etiology of other educational domains, such as, 
science. Most studies have used teacher assessments or tests that had been administered by 
the researchers through the internet, telephone or during a home-visit while only a few used 
standardized tests administered at school. Even though teacher assessments are correlated 
with standardized tests they might be less reliable measures of educational achievement. 
Furthermore, teacher ratings may be subject to rater bias when twins are taught in the same 
classroom and their educational achievement is rated by the same person. Each teacher has 
his or her own perception on educational achievement, which can make children seem more 
similar when they are assessed by the same teacher (Kan, van Beijsterveldt, Bartels, & 
Boomsma, 2014; Simonoff et al., 1998).
Most twin studies on educational achievement have primarily included English speaking 
children from the USA and the UK. Studies from other countries with different educational 
systems and languages are scarce (Byrne et al., 2009; Chow, Ho, Wong, Waye, & Bishop, 
2011; Samuelsson et al., 2008). The question addressed in this study is whether the same 
pattern of the relative contribution of genetic and environmental effects on the variation in 
educational achievement exists in the Netherlands. (Calvin et al., 2012) found genetic effects 
to be an important cause of variation in achievement in the educational domains language 
(43-74%) and arithmetic (36-73%) at ages 8, 10 and 12 in Dutch primary school children. 
However, they used a population cohort without information on zygosity and estimated the 
resemblance between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs from the proportion of same-sex 
and opposite-sex twin pairs, which is a much less powerful design than when zygosity is 
known.
In the Dutch educational system, the majority of primary schools use a pupil monitoring 
system that includes standardized tests assessing educational achievement (Cito, 2014a; 
Vlug, 1997). Tests are available for all grades and all important educational domains. The 
tests are independent of teaching methods and can be used to monitor a child’s educational 
development in comparison to peers and across grades and educational domains. Tests 
measuring arithmetic, word reading, reading comprehension and spelling are, according to 
an inventory amongst teachers, the most informative with regard to the educational 
development of children (Polderman et al., 2011). A standardized nation-wide educational 
achievement test is available for the last grade, measuring what a child has learned during all 
primary school years (Cito, 2002). Together, these data provide a unique opportunity to give 
an overview of the underlying etiology of differences in educational achievement on 
different educational domains across primary school grades.
Differences in average educational achievement between boys and girls could be due to 
differences in the etiology of educational achievement. Quantitative gender differences are

 present if one gender is affected to a greater extent by the same genetic or environmental 
effects. Qualitative gender differences exist when different genetic or environmental effects 
have an influence on boys and girls. Very few studies have examined differences between 
boys and girls in the etiology of educational achievement, probably due to small sample 
sizes. One large study utilizing teacher ratings to determine the level of educational 
achievement in language, reading, mathematics and science found no gender differences in 
the causes underlying differences between children (Kovas et al., 2007). Gender differences 
were also absent in another study using a standardized test to measure the reading level of 
children (Harlaar, Hayiou-Thomas, & Plomin, 2005).
The aim of the current study is to identify the impact of genes and the environment on 
educational achievement, i.e. arithmetic, word reading, reading comprehension and spelling, 
in primary school in a large cohort of Dutch twins and to explore possible gender 
differences.
2 Methods
2.1 Participants
The Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) was established around 1987 by the Department of 
Biological Psychology at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and registers approximately 40 
per cent of all multiple births in the Netherlands. The parents of twins participate in 
longitudinal data collection and receive a survey about the development of their children 
every 2 to 3 years up until the twins are 12 years old. Details about selection and response 
rates are described elsewhere (Bartels et al., 2007; Boomsma et al., 2002; Boomsma et al., 
2006; van Beijsterveldt et al., 2013). In 1999 the NTR started asking parents for their 
consent to approach the teacher(s) of their children attending primary school. Each year the 
parents of twins aged approximately 7, 9 and 12 years have been approached with this 
request. After parental consent, a survey is sent to the primary school teacher(s) of the twins 
and their siblings with questions about behavioral and emotional problems, functioning at 
school and educational achievement. In the Netherlands, a widespread pupil monitoring 
system is developed with standardized tests to monitor a child’s educational progress in 
primary school (‘LeerlingVolgSysteem’ in Dutch) (Cito, 2002). Since 2008 teachers are 
systematically asked to submit copies (usually a print-out) of the results on the pupil 
monitoring tests administered during the primary school period. Teachers were asked to 
provide information on the results of the tests administered in the current and previous 
grades. Approximately one third of the teachers who returned the teacher survey also send in 
a student report with the pupil monitoring test results. A final educational achievement (EA) 
test is administered at the end of the last grade of primary school (Cito, 2002). Because the 
results of the EA test become available at the end of the last school year, both the parents as 
well as the children themselves instead of the teachers are asked to report the scores on this 
EA test. Results on the EA test at the end of the primary school period have already been 
collected since 2000.
Data on at least one of the pupil monitoring tests (cohorts 1995-2006) or on the EA test 
(cohorts 1987-2001) were available for 16234 children. We excluded children who had a 
disease or handicap that interfered severely with daily functioning (N=90) or attended

 specialized education (N=79), in the Dutch education system special schools are available 
for children who need extra care due to learning problems, physical and/or mental 
disabilities or a behavioral disorder, resulting in data for 7228 complete and 1609 
incomplete twin pairs. The main reason for incomplete data is that twins attend different 
classes or schools and only one of the teachers returned the results on the pupil monitoring 
tests. Approximately 45 per cent of the twin pairs attend different classes in a given grade of 
primary school, with only a very small proportion of these twin pairs going to different 
schools.
This study included data of 2818 twin pairs of opposite sex. For same-sex twin pairs, the 
determination of zygosity status was based on blood group or DNA polymorphisms 
(N=1363) or on parental report of items on resemblance in appearance and confusion of the 
twins by parents and others (N=4586). This last method can establish zygosity with an 
accuracy of approximately 93 per cent (Rietveld et al., 2000). Twin pairs for which zygosity 
was unavailable were excluded from the analyses (N=70). Results for at least one of the 
pupil monitoring tests were available for approximately one third of these twin pairs (496 
MZm, 456 DZm, 541 MZf, 418 DZf and 825 DOS) and data on the EA test were available 
for the majority of the twin pairs (1113 MZm, 1132 DZm, 1338 MZf, 1149 DZf and 2288 
DOS).
2.2 Measurements
The pupil monitoring system consists of age appropriate tests, independent of teaching 
methods, which are administered at three fixed time points (i.e. beginning, half way and end 
of a school year) to assess the educational achievement of a child in all important 
educational domains (Cito, 2014a). Tests with increasing difficulty are available for both the 
different time points in each grade and the different grades of primary school (grade 1: 6-7 
years; grade 2: 7-8 years; grade 3: 8-9 years; 4: 9-10 years; grade 5: 10-11 years; grade 6: 
11-12 years). The results on the tests are entered into a database which enables teachers to 
compile student reports with the results of the different tests across all time points and 
grades. In this study the results on the tests administered halfway through the school year 
have been used in the analyses.
Each test consists of a number of items that can provide a correct response and the number 
of correct responses is converted in an ability score. Conversion of test scores is done based 
on item-response theory (IRT) to ensure that the development in ability scores is on a single 
scale (Vlug, 1997). This results in ability scores that can be compared within and between 
grades to monitor a child’s development over time and in comparison to its peers. Some of 
the pupil monitoring tests have been updated with new questions which resulted in different 
versions of the tests administered across children. An inventory amongst teachers indicated 
that the tests measuring arithmetic, reading, reading comprehension and spelling were the 
most informative with regard to a child’s educational achievement (Polderman et al., 2011).
2.2.1 Arithmetic—The arithmetic test (grade 1 to 6) consists of one part in which 
children have to solve simple math problems within a short time period and a second part 
with more complex math problems without a time limit. The test assesses general knowledge 
de Zeeuw et al.

 of mathematics and arithmetic and comprises written computational problems of addition, 
subtraction, multiplication and division and problems on the notion of measurements, time 
and money, and knowledge about fractions, ratios and percentages.
2.2.2 Word Reading—The word reading test (grade 1 to 6) measures word decoding 
skills by counting the total number of individual words a child can correctly read aloud in 1 
minute. The test consists of three levels of increasing difficulty and complexity. The first 
level includes words that are pronounced exactly as they are spelled, the second level 
includes also other monosyllabic words and the third level includes two or more syllabic 
words. This study used the most difficult level of the test which is in general not yet 
administered in the first grade.
2.2.3 Reading Comprehension—The reading comprehension test (grade 3 to 6) 
includes a large variety of different text types and genres with two different types of multiple 
choice questions. The test consists of a first part in which a child has to read a number of 
short texts and answer questions related to the text and a second part with parts of the text 
left blank that need to be filled out. The test tries to assess different components of reading 
processing by questions regarding both the facts and events described in the texts as well as 
by questions about the purpose of the writer and the intended readership of the texts.
2.2.4 Spelling—The spelling test (grade 1 to 6) measures both active, writing down the 
words, and passive, recognizing spelling errors, spelling. Active spelling is measured with a 
dictation by the teacher where a sentence is read aloud and a child has to write down a 
specific word from this sentence. Passive spelling is measured with multiple choice 
questions were a student has to select the answer in which the word that is printed in bold is 
spelled incorrectly.
2.2.5 Educational Achievement—At the end of primary school a nationwide 
educational achievement (EA) test is administered over a period of 3 days (Cito, 2002). This 
final test measures what a child has learned in 6 years of primary education. The results of 
this test determine, along with the advice of the teacher, which level of secondary education 
is suitable for a child. The EA test consists of multiple choice items in four different 
educational domains, namely Arithmetic, Language, Study Skills and Science and Social 
Studies. The first three test scales are combined into a Total Score, which is standardized on 
a scale from 501 to 550. The Arithmetic scale includes items on numbers and operations, 
ratios, fractions and percentages, and measurements, geometry, time and money. The 
Language scale includes items on writing, spelling, reading comprehension and vocabulary. 
The Study Skills scale includes items on handling of study texts, handling of information, 
reading diagrams, tables and graphs and map reading. The Science and Social Studies scale 
includes items on geography, history and biology. All scores on the scales are standardized 
to percentile scores to correct for differences in the number of items across the years. The 
internal reliability of the EA test is good (α = .95) as is the simulated test-retest reliability (r 
= .96) (Herman, Ronald, & Anja, 2011). The score on the test has been shown to correlate 
moderately with general cognitive ability (r = .63) (Bartels et al., 2002).

 2.3 Statistical Analyses
Twin correlations, separately for gender, were estimated using maximum likelihood 
estimation in the R (R Core Team, 2014) package OpenMx Version 2.3.1 (Boker et al., 2012; 
Boker et al., 2011). A model that freely estimated all parameters, i.e. means, variances and 
covariances, separately for the different zygosity-by-gender groups (MZm, DZm, MZf, DZf 
and DOS), was fitted to the data (saturated model). In this model, it was tested whether 
constraining the means and variances to be equal across gender led to a significant 
deterioration of the model fit (Purcell, 2002). Questions have been updated for the tests for 
arithmetic, reading comprehension and spelling, resulting in different versions of the tests 
administered across children. To correct for differences across versions, means and variances 
were estimated separately for the two versions.
To gain further insight into the causes of individual differences in educational achievement 
of children in primary school, univariate genetic models were fitted to the data for each 
educational domain and grade. The variation in educational achievement was decomposed 
into variance due to additive genetic effects (A), to shared or common environmental effects 
(C) and to non-shared unique environmental effects (E) (Posthuma et al., 2003). Additive 
genetic effects are the sum of the additive effects of all genetic variants influencing 
educational achievement. Shared or common environmental variance results from 
environmental effects that are shared by both members of a twin pair. Non-shared or unique 
environmental variance results from environmental effects that are not shared by a twin pair 
and also includes measurement error. The variance components A, C and E were estimated 
separately for boys and girls. The variance components are expected to correlate differently 
for MZ and DZ twin pairs due to the difference in genetic resemblance (Figure 1). Since MZ 
twin pairs share (nearly) all their genes the correlation between the genetic effects of MZ 
twin pairs is fixed to 1.0. DZ twin pairs share approximately 50 per cent of their segregating 
genes and therefore the correlation between the genetic effects of DZ twin pairs is fixed to 
0.5. The correlation between the genetic effects is estimated freely for DOS twin pairs as 
different genetic effects could have an influence on educational achievement in boys and 
girls. For both MZ, DZ and DOS twin pairs the correlation between the common 
environmental effects is fixed to 1.0.
In the subsequent models, the influence of the gender of the student on the variance 
components was tested in two ways. First, we tested whether the same genetic effects are 
important in boys and girls (qualitative gender differences) by fixing the correlation between 
the genetic effects of DOS twin pairs to be equal to the correlation for DZ twin pairs. 
Qualitative gender differences will result in a lower genetic correlation between DOS twin 
pairs. Second, we tested whether the genetic effects had an influence to the same extent in 
boys and girls (quantitative gender differences) by fitting a model, which incorporates total 
variance differences, but does not allow the relative contribution of the variance components 
to be different between boys and girls. Quantitative gender differences will result in unequal 
variance components between boys and girls. Finally, the significance of the common 
environmental effects was tested by dropping them from the model. The difference in model 
fit between the nested models was assessed with a log-likelihood ratio test (LRT) which 
calculates the difference in -2log-likelihood (-2LL) between the models and evaluates the chi

 square-statistic using the difference in degrees of freedom between the models. A p-value 
smaller than 0.01 was considered significant. Constraints were kept, when a more restrictive 
model did not significantly decrease the goodness of fit, as a more parsimonious model is 
preferred.
3 Results
Table 1 gives the means and standard deviations of scores on the pupil monitoring tests 
across all grades and the educational achievement test, for boys and girls separately and for 
the different versions of the tests. There were significant gender differences for arithmetic in 
all grades and for reading comprehension and spelling in some grades. Boys were on 
average better at arithmetic and girls performed on average better on the reading 
comprehension and spelling tests. On average there were no gender differences for the word 
reading tests. Gender differences were also present for the total score on the educational 
achievement test and for all subscales.Boys scored on average higher on arithmetic, study 
skills and science and social studies while girls obtained on average better results for 
language.
Twin correlations were estimated in the five zygosity-by-gender groups (Table 2). All MZ 
correlations were higher than DZ correlations, suggesting additive genetic effects.Sometimes 
DZ correlations were larger than half the MZ correlations, suggesting common 
environmental effects. The genetic model fitting results with the standardized estimates and 
their 95% confidence intervals are reported for arithmetic, word reading, reading 
comprehension and spelling across grades and an educational achievement test administered 
in the last grade of primary school (Table 3). In bold the results for the most parsimonious 
model that did not significantly deteriorate the goodness of fit. The full models showed 
small differences between boys and girls in the estimates of the variance components, but 
these were, in general, not significant. The relative contribution of the additive genetic, 
common environmental and unique environmental effects are displayed for the models 
estimating all variance components equal for boys and girls while allowing total variance 
differences (Figure 2).
Genetic effects were the most important contributor to individual differences in educational 
achievement in arithmetic (60-74%), word reading (72-82%) and reading comprehension 
(54-64%) and for most grades in spelling (33-70%). Common environmental effects had a 
negligible influence on arithmetic (0-8%), word reading (0-7%) and reading comprehension 
(1-12%) and a slightly larger influence on spelling (0-29%). Unique environmental effects 
explained the remaining variance in arithmetic (26-34%), word reading (11-29%), reading 
comprehension (32-35%) and spelling (30-39%). Genes were also the largest contributor to 
the variation in the educational achievement test (74%). The heritability differed somewhat 
between the educational domains measured with this test, i.e. arithmetic (68%), language 
(67%), study skills (60%) and science and social studies (56%). The common environmental 
effects were also small for the total score (8%), arithmetic (5%), language (10%), study 
skills (6%) and science and social studies (21%). Unique environmental effects explained 
the remaining variance (18-34%).

 4 Discussion
The current study presents the etiology of achievement in several educational domains 
across primary school grades 1 to 6, approximately corresponding to ages 6 to 12, in a large, 
representative cohort from The Netherlands. The influence of the genetic and environmental 
effects was systematically examined for the educational domains of arithmetic, word 
reading, reading comprehension and spelling. The extent to which genes influenced 
differences in educational achievement was large and relatively stable across all grades for 
arithmetic (60-74%), word reading (72-82%) and reading comprehension (54-64%). Similar 
heritability estimates were obtained at all ages despite large differences in content across 
grades. The influence of the common environment was negligible for these educational 
domains. The heritability of spelling was somewhat small in the first grade (33%), but 
increased at later ages (58-70%). In contrast to later grades, the common environment had an 
influence on spelling in the first grade of primary school. Studies in preschool children 
report a much larger influence of the common environment, shared by all children in a 
family, on, for example, reading (Byrne et al., 2009; Oliver, Dale, & Plomin, 2005), than has 
been found for school children. Lessons in the first grade focus mainly on reading and 
arithmetic while spelling becomes more important in later grades when children have 
learned how to read words. It could be that, in the first grade, the common home 
environment still influences spelling while this is no longer the case for reading and 
arithmetic.
Heritability of a standardized educational achievement test in the last grade was high (74%) 
while the influence of the common environment was low. There was a noteworthy difference 
with regard to the etiology of the specific domains included in the educational achievement 
test. Science and social studies was less heritable with a larger influence of the common 
environment compared to arithmetic and language. A lower heritability is also observed in 
earlier research on science performance (Haworth, Dale, & Plomin, 2009; Haworth, Kovas, 
Dale, & Plomin, 2008). A possible explanation for this difference in heritability between the 
core educational domains, i.e. language and reading, and science and social studies is that 
there is more heterogeneity in the curriculum and lessons on topics related to geography, 
history and biology while the methods for teaching children to read and calculate are more 
standardized. The larger heterogeneity in education will increase differences in the 
environment and, as a result, individual differences between children will, relatively, to a 
lesser extent be explained by genes (Heath et al., 1985).
Traditional mean gender differences in educational achievement were observed with boys, 
on average, scoring better on numeracy and girls performing, on average, better at some of 
the literacy subjects (Cito, 2014b; OECD, 2010). However, there was no consistent 
indication for the presence of quantitative gender differences, meaning that the extent to 
which genes and the environment influence educational achievement is similar across 
gender. Qualitative gender differences were also not present which means that the genes that 
have an influence on educational achievement are the same for boys and girls. Taken 
together, this rules out a difference in the genetic architecture of educational achievement as 
an explanation for the mean differences between boys and girls. This is in line with findings 
from a study of teacher ratings measuring educational achievement in multiple educational

 domains (Kovas et al., 2007). The absence of gender differences in genes with an effect on 
educational achievement in children has implications for the attempts to find genetic variants 
with genome-wide association studies since it will be possible to combine the data on 
educational achievement in boys and girls resulting in larger sample sizes.
The twin method assumes that MZ twins are more similar than DZ twins because of their 
larger genetic resemblance and not because MZ twins are treated more alike than DZ twins, 
by for example teachers, or otherwise experience more similar environments, such as sharing 
the same classroom or friends. The equal environment assumption is potentially violated 
when characteristics of the environment are more often shared between MZ twins than DZ 
twins. This would mean that the difference between the similarity for MZ and DZ twin pairs 
is no longer due to differences in genetic similarity, but to a combination of genetic and 
environmental effects, and the impact of genes will be overestimated. However, this is only 
the case when the similarity in the environment relates to a resemblance in a phenotype. 
Research has shown that the equal environment assumption holds for, amongst others, 
general cognitive ability and educational achievement (Evans & Martin, 2000; Loehlin, 
1989).
To be able to generalize the outcome of twin studies to the general population, the twin 
method further assumes that twins are representative of the general population for the 
phenotype of interest. Twins do differ from singletons in striking ways with regard to birth 
conditions.Twins are born, on average, 3-4 weeks prematurely and have approximately 1 kg 
lower birth weights (Martin et al., 2010). These differences dissipate fairly early on, 
however, and, already in childhood, twins and singletons have very similar scores for body 
size (Estourgie-van Burk, Bartels, Boomsma, & Delemarre-van de Waal, 2010) and, more 
relevantly, for general cognitive ability (Webbink, Posthuma, Boomsma, de Geus, & 
Visscher, 2008) and educational achievement (Cohen, van Goozen, Orlebeke, Buitelaar, & 
Cohen-Kettenis, 2002; de Zeeuw, van Beijsterveldt, De Geus, & Boomsma, 2012).
Heritability estimates for educational achievement in the Netherlands are comparable to 
other countries, especially the UK (Kovas et al., 2013). Apparently genes account for most 
individual differences across these populations. The relative contribution of genes and the 
environment to the variation in educational achievement can differ when either the genetic 
effects are different or the environmental effects differ, for example, due to differences in 
SES, national curriculum or educational opportunities. Differences across countries may 
lead to a relatively larger or smaller role of the environment. The educational system in The 
Netherlands is similar to the one implemented in the UK, as both countries have a national 
curriculum, while the educational system in, for example, the USA is more decentralized. A 
national curriculum likely restricts the variation in school environments leading to an 
increase in the relative contribution of genes to the variation in educational achievement. It 
would be of interest to systematically investigate whether these differences between 
countries in educational system are reflected in differences in heritability.
Although the individual differences between children in their achievement across different 
educational domains are for a large part due to innate differences, one must keep in mind 
that this heritability does not equal determinism. First of all, the variance between children

 may be heritable, but the mean can be positively influenced by a school environment of good 
quality. For example, when increasing instruction time for a certain educational domain 
there will be an increase in the average ability in this domain. Furthermore, some 
environments can affect some children more than others (gene-environment interaction). For 
example, children with a certain genetic make-up may respond better to a specific tutoring 
program than other children. In our view, the challenge for teachers is to make sure that 
children, who have more difficulty at school, will learn how to read, write and perform 
calculations, while the children that learn easily are still sufficiently challenged. Whole-
classroom teaching might not be the best method to achieve this goal and a more 
personalized approach to education will be necessary. Unfortunately, the increasing number 
of children per teacher and the demand on teachers with regard to administrative duties 
might preclude teachers from customizing their lessons to the needs of each child. Advances 
in technology might perhaps in the future be the answer to providing each child with 
individual lessons targeting their specific needs.
