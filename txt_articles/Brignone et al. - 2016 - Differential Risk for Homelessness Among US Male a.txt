IMPORTANCE Military sexual trauma (MST) is associated with adverse physical and mental
health outcomes following military separation. Recent research suggests that MST may be a
determinant in several factors associated with postdeployment homelessness.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate MST as an independent risk factor for homelessness and to determine
whether risk varies by sex.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort study of US veterans who used
Veterans Health Administration (VHA) services between fiscal years 2004 and 2013 was
conducted using administrative data from the Department of Defense and VHA. Included in
the study were 601 892 US veterans deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan who separated from the
military between fiscal years 2001 and 2011 and subsequently used VHA services.
EXPOSURE Positive response to screen for MST administered in VHA facilities.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Administrative evidence of homelessness within 30 days, 1
year, and 5 years following the first VHA encounter after last deployment.
RESULTS The mean (SD) age of the 601 892 participants was 38.9 (9.4) years, 527 874
(87.7%) were male, 310 854 (51.6%) were white, and 382 361 (63.5%) were enlisted in the
Army. Among veterans with a positive screen for MST, rates of homelessness were 1.6%
within 30 days, 4.4% within 1 year, and 9.6% within 5 years, more than double the rates of
veterans with a negative MST screen (0.7%, 1.8%, and 4.3%, respectively). A positive screen
for MST was significantly and independently associated with postdeployment homelessness.
In regression models adjusted for demographic and military service characteristics, odds of
experiencing homelessness were higher among those who screened positive for MST
compared with those who screened negative (30-day: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.89; 95%
CI, 1.58-2.24; 1-year: AOR, 2.27; 95% CI, 2.04-2.53; and 5-year: AOR, 2.63; 95% CI, 2.36-2.93).
Military sexual trauma screen status remained independently associated with homelessness
after adjusting for co-occurring mental health and substance abuse diagnoses in follow-up
regression models (30-day: AOR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.36-1.93; 1-year: AOR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.33-1.66;
and 5-year: AOR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.24-1.55). In the fully adjusted models, the interaction
between MST status and sex was significant in the 30-day and 1-year cohorts (30-day: AOR,
1.54; 95% CI, 1.18-2.02; and 1-year: AOR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.23-1.74), denoting higher risk for
homelessness among males with a positive screen for MST.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A positive screen for MST was independently associated with
postdeployment homelessness, with male veterans at greater risk than female veterans.
These results underscore the importance of the MST screen as a clinically important marker
of reintegration outcomes among veterans. These findings demonstrate significant long-term
negative effects and inform our understanding of the public health implications of sexual
abuse and harassment.

T
he US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) defines mili-
tary sexual trauma (MST) as “psychological trauma,
which in the judgment of a mental health professional
employed by the Department, resulted from a physical
assault of a sexual nature, battery of a sexual nature, or
sexual harassment which occurred while the veteran was
serving on active duty or active duty for training.”1 Approxi-
mately 25% of female and 1% of male veterans report having
experienced MST during their military service.2 Military
sexual trauma is related to adverse outcomes following
separation from the military, including posttraumatic stress
disorder, depressive disorders, substance use disorders,2-6
and higher rates of cooccurrence among these diagnoses.
Military sexual trauma is also associated with poorer family
relations and lower quality of life.4 Given the negative effect
of MST on postdeployment health, the Veterans Health
Administration (VHA) initiated MST screening for all veter-
ans seeking care in any of its medical facilities in 2004.
Many outcomes associated with MST are known corre-
lates of homelessness,7 and preliminary research has sug-
gested elevated rates of MST among homeless veterans.8-12
Veterans are overrepresented in the US homeless
population.13,14 This presents a serious public health con-
cern because homelessness is associated with major physi-
cal and mental health disparities as well as mortality.15-18
Given the near-universal administration of MST screening
to new VHA users, screen results represent a potentially
valuable early marker for homelessness. Unlike related
mental health and substance abuse risk factors for home-
lessness, MST screen results are available for most VHA
users, regardless of treatment-seeking behaviors or level of
care received.
To our knowledge, no study has systematically evalu-
ated MST as a risk factor for postdeployment homelessness
in a sample of male and female veterans recently discharged
from military service to date. Additionally, although sex
differences have been identified in certain MST-related
outcomes,19-21 it is currently unknown whether risk for
homelessness is similar among men and women who
have experienced MST. Therefore, the purpose of this study
was to address these gaps by using a large, representative
cohort of male and female veterans of Operation Enduring
Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) who
have used VHA services to examine the association between
MST and postdeployment homelessness. We set out to
determine whether: (1) a history of MST, as indicated by a
positive screen for MST, serves as a risk factor for postde-
ployment homelessness; (2) the association between MST
status and homelessness varies by sex; and (3) positive MST
status remains significantly associated with homelessness
after adjusting for additional known correlates of MST and
homelessness, such as mental health and substance use
disorders.
Identifying and substantiating MST as a risk factor for
homelessness, including possible differential effects by sex,
may aid in the prevention and mitigation of veteran home-
lessness and may help explain the current overrepresenta-
tion of military veterans in the US homeless population.
Methods
Theworkingdatasetwascreatedbymergingdemographicand
military service data from the 2011 OEF/OIF official roster file
with health care data from VHA. The roster included veter-
ans who separated from the military between fiscal years (FY)
2001 and 2011. The roster contained the following adminis-
tratively determined demographic and military service vari-
ables: age, education, race/ethnicity, marital status, branch of
service, rank, and component (Active Duty, Reserve, or Na-
tional Guard). Data from the VHA were extracted from the
Managerial Cost Accounting National Data Extracts from FY
2004 to 2013 and contained information on nationwide clini-
cal service usage, including inpatient, outpatient, and phar-
macyuse.Visit-leveldatawereusedtocreatevariablesforMST
screen results, indicators of homelessness, and mental health
and substance use diagnoses. The merged data set included
785 612 veterans found on the roster and whose first VHA en-
counter occurred from FY 2004 to 2013.
Approval for this study was granted from the institu-
tional review boards of the University of Utah School of Medi-
cine and of Utah State University as well as the Research and
Development Committee for the VA Salt Lake City Health Care
System. Because of the large number of veterans involved and
the retrospective nature of the study, Health Insurance Por-
tabilityandAccountabilityActauthorizationandinformedcon-
sent were waived.
To address individual variability in the available length of
follow-up in VHA clinical data and to evaluate both the short-
and long-term associations between MST screen status and
postdeployment homelessness, 3 cohorts were constructed to
determine the incidence of homelessness within 30 days, 1
year, and 5 years from initial VHA encounter.22 Administra-
tive surveillance in each cohort began on the date of each vet-
eran’
s first VHA encounter after the last deployment noted in
the OEF/OIF roster file and ended after the specified length of
follow-up for the given cohort. Included in each analytical co-
hort were MST screening results recorded at any point over ad-
ministrative follow-up, static demographic and military ser-
vicecharacteristics,indicatorsformentalhealthandsubstance
Key Points
Question Is exposure to military sexual trauma (MST), as
indicated by a positive screen for MST, a risk factor for
postdeployment homelessness, and does risk vary by sex?
Findings In this cohort study of 601 892 recently discharged
veterans, a positive screen for MST was significantly and
independently associated with homelessness among men and
women, with a differentially stronger risk among men. By 5 years,
nearly 10% of veterans with a positive screen for MST had
experienced homelessness.
Meaning Results from MST screening represent a clinically
important marker for homelessness. These findings demonstrate
significant long-term negative effects of sexual abuse and
harassment.

use conditions as primary diagnosis codes, and evidence of
homelessness that occurred during the range of follow-up cor-
responding to each cohort. Veterans were included in a given
cohort if they contributed data for the duration of the period
and if their file indicated an MST screen result of “yes” or “no.
”
The cohort selection process is shown in the Figure.
Military Sexual Trauma Classification
During VHA primary care and mental health inpatient or out-
patient visits, a clinical reminder appears on the electronic
medical record if the veteran has not been screened for MST.
The reminder prompts the clinician to administer the screen,
which consists of the following questions: “While you were in
the military… (a) did you receive uninvited and unwanted
sexual attention, such as touching, cornering, pressure for
sexualfavors,orverbalremarks?(b)didsomeoneeveruseforce
or threat of force to have sexual contact with you against your
will?”
Veterans may respond “yes,” “no,” or “decline” to either
item. Exposure to MST is considered a duty-related hazard,
and screening items are designed to represent a single con-
struct. Thus, the screen is considered positive if a veteran
responds in the affirmative to either item. Results are
recorded as a single variable in VA administrative data, and
items cannot be analyzed separately. Cases with a response
of “decline” (<0.2%) were omitted from the sample.
Because MST represents a historical experience, the screen
is generally administered once for each veteran. However,
those who initially decline the screen are rescreened in a
year. In the case of multiple screen results on file, the most
recent screen result was used.
Although MST screening protocol does not include evalu-
ation for psychological trauma, which is a component of MST
as defined by VA, a positive screen is considered sufficient evi-
dence for eligibility for MST-related services, including treat-
ment and additional evaluation. For the purposes of the pre-
sent study, a positive screen was considered a marker for
history of MST.
Veteran Homelessness
Veterans were identified as having administrative evidence of
postdeployment homelessness if they received an Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modi-
fication (ICD-9-CM) code of V60.0 (indicating “lack of hous-
ing”) as either their primary or other code during a VHA visit
or a non-ICD VHA clinic or specialty code related to the re-
ceipt of homeless services.12,23 Therefore, a veteran was con-
sidered to be homeless in a given cohort if they had any ad-
ministrative evidence since military separation within that
period.

Amongveteranswithevidenceofhomelessness,86%were
screened for MST prior to their first evidence of homeless-
ness. Rates of positive MST screen did not significantly differ
betweenveteranswhowerescreenedforMSTbeforeinitialevi-

sure in the latter group.
Mental Health Diagnoses
Mental health and substance abuse ICD-9-CM diagnoses were
retrieved from VHA clinical data. The posttraumatic stress dis-
ordervariablewascreatedusingICD-9-CMcode309.81.There-
maining diagnostic variables were based on classifications of
ICD-9-CM codes as defined by the Healthcare Utilization and
Costs Project Clinical Classification Software (HCUP-CCS;
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality).24 The following
categories from HCUP-CCS were used: depressive disorders,
alcohol-relateddisorders,substance-relateddisorders,person-
ality disorders, bipolar disorders, and schizophrenia and other
psychotic disorders. To increase diagnostic specificity, a diag-
nosis was marked as present if the medical record contained 2
or more ICD-9-CM codes in the given category. Additionally, a

Results
Table 1 presents a summary of all demographic and military
information and MST screening results for each follow-up co-
hort. Table 2 presents the incidence of homelessness strati-
fied by MST screen status and sex for each cohort. Among vet-
eranswithapositivescreenforMST,incidenceofhomelessness
was 1.6% within 30 days, 4.4% within 1 year, and 9.6% within
5 years. The trends were similar for male and female veterans
with a positive MST screen but with slightly higher rates
for males (30-day: 2.3%; 1-year: 6.2%; and 5-year: 11.8%)
compared with females (30-day: 1.3%; 1-year: 3.9%; and
5-year: 8.9%). Rates of positive MST screens among homeless
veterans were nearly double those of nonhomeless veterans
(30-day: 0.7%; 1-year: 1.8%; and 5-year: 4.3%).
Table 3 presents AORs and their 95% CIs for each logistic
regression analysis. In every model across all 3 follow-up co-
horts, a positive screen for MST was significantly and inde-
pendently associated with homelessness. In models unad-
justedformentalhealthandsubstanceusediagnoses,veterans
with a positive MST screen had approximately double the odds
for homelessness (30-day: AOR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.58-2.24; 1-year:
AOR, 2.27; 95% CI, 2.04-2.53; and 5-year: AOR, 2.63; 95% CI,
2.36-2.93) than those who screened negative (1 [Reference]).
Additionally, there was a significant MST by sex interaction for
the 30-day (AOR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.19-2.02) and 1-year (AOR, 1.43;
95% CI, 1.21-1.69) cohorts, with positive screens for MST con-
ferring greater risk for homelessness among men compared
with women. Follow-up tests of simple main effects revealed
that MST was significantly associated with homelessness
among both men and women for each follow-up cohort but
more strongly for men (Table 3).
In models adjusted for mental health and substance use
diagnoses, MST screen status remained significantly associ-
ated with homelessness; veterans with a positive MST screen
hadapproximately1.5timesgreateroddsforhomelessness(30-
day: AOR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.36-1.93; 1-year: AOR, 1.49; 95% CI,
1.33-1.66; and 5-year: AOR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.24-1.55) than those
who screened negative (1 [Reference]). A significant interac-
tion between MST status and sex in the 30-day (AOR, 1.54; 95%
CI, 1.18-2.02) and 1-year (AOR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.23-1.74) cohorts
again suggested a greater risk for homelessness among men
with a history of MST than women. Follow-up tests of simple
main effects again revealed that MST was significantly asso-
ciated with homelessness among both men and women for
each follow-up cohort, also stronger for men (Table 3).

among a large national sample of US veterans and the first to
examine the differential risk for homelessness due to MST ex-
posure by sex. These results indicate that positive MST screen
status is independently associated with homelessness above
and beyond demographic and military service characteristics
as well as related cooccurring mental illnesses and substance
abuse. Additionally, risk for homelessness varies differen-
tially for males and females depending on MST screen status,

associated with homelessness as early as 30 days after the first
VHA encounter and continued to be associated with home-
lessness through the end of follow-up at 5 years, indicating
that MST affects both immediate and long-term reintegration
outcomes.
In addition to the independent association of MST screen
status with homelessness, results from this study indicate that

effectsofMSTandassociatedmentalhealthdiagnosesonpost-
deployment reintegration are far-reaching. Psychosocial
sequelae include a tendency toward poorer interpersonal re-
lationships, lower levels of social support, medical problems,
postmilitary adversity, revictimization, and criminal justice
involvement,4,9,26allofwhichmayconferriskforfinancialand
housing instability. Given these linkages, positive MST status
may represent a single data point that serves as an important
marker for potential challenges to successful community re-
integration, with postdeployment homelessness as an ex-
treme case of poor reintegration.
The results of this study extend previous research8-12 in
severalways.First,thesamplesusedinthisstudyincludedvet-
erans with and without a history of homelessness, allowing for
direct comparisons between these groups. Second, the data
used in this study were comprehensive, using a national data
set including male veterans and covering multiple years of ob-
servation. Last, evaluating the association between MST and
homelessness with and without adjusting for related mental
health and substance use diagnoses allowed for the exami-
nation of MST both as a marker for homelessness in the
absence of further diagnostic information and as a signifi-
cant association above and beyond known correlates of MST
and homelessness.
The stronger risk conferred by MST for postdeployment
homelessness among men suggests that men with a positive
MST screen are a particularly vulnerable group. This finding
provides additional evidence for certain disproportionately
negative effects of sexual abuse and harassment among men.
Several studies have identified adverse outcomes associated
with sexual abuse and harassment for which men are at
greater conditional risk compared with women, including
psychiatric symptoms, reported distress, and alcohol abuse
in civilian populations,20-22 and bipolar disorder, psychosis,

and schizophrenia in military populations.2 In addition to the
burden of issues regarding masculinity, sexuality, and self-
concept among males who have experienced sexual trauma,27
sex differences in risk for homelessness conferred by MST sta-
tus may relate to differences in treatment-seeking behaviors
following a positive screen. Specifically, among veterans not
using mental health services prior to MST screening, women
were more likely to access mental health treatment following
apositivescreenthanweremen,28potentiallyleavingmenwith
unmet mental health needs and vulnerable to adverse out-
comes, including the progression of psychiatric symptoms and
homelessness.
We acknowledge several limitations in this study. A posi-
tive screen for MST is a self-reported marker of having expe-
rienced MST and not a diagnosis. Because a positive screen for
MST is associated with increased service use, there may be
more opportunities to detect homelessness among veterans
with a positive screen. However, the differentially lower MST-
related risk for homelessness among women despite their
higher rates of MST-related treatment-seeking suggests that
increased use does not account for greater detection of home-
lessness. Additionally, the exclusive use of administrative data
to determine housing status may result in an underestima-
tion of homelessness rates, and the use of a sample limited to
veterans seeking care at VHA facilities may limit generaliz-
ability. This study relies on self-reported MST status, and vet-
erans may choose not to disclose MST for a variety of reasons.
Under current screening protocol, a positive screen for MST
may indicate a broad range of experiences from verbal harass-
ment to physical assault. Thus, there may be an unseen “dose
response” relating to severity or chronicity of trauma and as-
sociated outcomes. Finally, these data do not provide infor-
mation regarding adverse premilitary circumstances or other
traumatic stressors, which may be an important factor given
theincreasedlikelihoodforinterpersonalviolenceamongthose
with prior trauma.6,9,29
Although this study is limited to veterans of the US mili-
tary, sexual abuse and harassment of military personnel is not
unique to the United States; international research literature
indicatesthatsexualharassmentandassaultareprevalent.30-33
Sexual abuse and harassment are also prevalent in civilian
populations, and similar difficulties may exist among survi-
vors in these populations.
Conclusions
Results from this study inform our understanding of veteran
homelessness, demonstrating the role of sexual abuse and ha-
rassment as an important factor in the complex causal path-
ways to homelessness. Additionally, these results under-
score the relevance of the MST screen as a marker of clinical
and prognostic significance regarding reintegration out-
comesandemphasizetheimportanceoftrauma-informedcare
and trauma-specific interventions for veterans with a posi-
tive screen for MST.34,35 Future research focusing on the tem-
poral associations among sexual trauma, mental health diag-
noses, and treatment use could yield important information
on effective prevention and intervention of postdeployment
homelessness.
