Purpose
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) offers the potential for minimally invasive genome-wide profiling of tumor
alterations without tumor biopsy and may be associated with patient prognosis. Triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by few mutations but extensive somatic copy number al-
terations (SCNAs), yet little is known regarding SCNAs in metastatic TNBC. We sought to evaluate
SCNAs in metastatic TNBC exclusively via cfDNA and determine if cfDNA tumor fraction is as-
sociated with overall survival in metastatic TNBC.
Patients and Methods
In this retrospective cohort study, we identified 164 patients with biopsy-proven metastatic
TNBC at a single tertiary care institution who received prior chemotherapy in the (neo)adjuvant
or metastatic setting. We performed low-coverage genome-wide sequencing of cfDNA from
plasma.
Results
Without prior knowledge of tumor mutations, we determined tumor fraction of cfDNA for 96.3% of
patients and SCNAs for 63.9% of patients. Copy number profiles and percent genome altered were
remarkably similar between metastatic and primary TNBCs. Certain SCNAs were more frequent in
metastatic TNBCs relative to paired primary tumors and primary TNBCs in publicly available data sets
The Cancer Genome Atlas and METABRIC, including chromosomal gains in drivers NOTCH2, AKT2,
and AKT3. Prespecified cfDNA tumor fraction threshold of $ 10% was associated with significantly
worse metastatic survival (median, 6.4 v 15.9 months) and remained significant independent of
clinicopathologic factors (hazard ratio, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.8; P , .001).
Conclusion
We present the largest genomic characterization of metastatic TNBC to our knowledge, exclusively
from cfDNA. Evaluation of cfDNA tumor fraction was feasible for nearly all patients, and tumor
fraction $ 10% is associated with significantly worse survival in this large metastatic TNBC cohort.
Specific SCNAs are enriched and prognostic in metastatic TNBC, with implications for metastasis,
resistance, and novel therapeutic approaches.

INTRODUCTION
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) makes up
10% to 15% of all breast cancers yet accounts for
more than one third of breast cancer–related deaths.1-5
TNBC is defined by lack of expression of ther-
apeutic targets human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2) and estrogen receptor alpha
(ERa), and chemotherapy remains the mainstay
of treatment.4,6,7 Extensive recent efforts have
defined clinicopathologic, genomic, and tran-
scriptomic features of primary TNBC (pTNBC).2,5,8-18
pTNBC is defined by relatively few somatic
single-nucleotide variants and indels (approxi-
mately one mutation per megabase).2,18,19 How-
ever, pTNBC demonstrates frequent loss of TP53
and genomic instability with widespread somatic
copy number alterations (SCNAs), implicating a crit-
ical role of SCNAs in TNBC tumorigenesis.2,9,10

 Although a few studies have begun to interrogate the genomic features of
metastatic TNBC (mTNBC),20-27 there have been no analyses of large
cohorts of patients with mTNBC published to date.
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is shed into the circulation by both
normal and malignant cells, and next-generation sequencing
analysis of cfDNA offers minimally invasive genomic profiling of
tumor alterations without tumor biopsy. Prior applications of
cfDNA have focused on tracking specific mutations28-33 or se-
quencing targeted panels of cancer-related genes.22,34-38 Building
on others’ work demonstrating the feasibility of genome-wide copy
number analysis from plasma in patients with cancer,21,39,40 we
developed an algorithm, ichorCNA,38 to profile SCNAs and quantify
tumor fraction (TFx) via low-coverage (0.13) whole-genome
sequencing of cfDNA, without the need for prior knowledge of
tumor mutations. Here, we evaluate the association of cfDNA TFx
with survival and use cfDNA as a comprehensive biopsy surrogate
to study the genomics of a disease infrequently biopsied in clinical
practice, identifying key SCNAs that are enriched and prognostic in
mTNBC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patient Identification and Clinicopathologic Data
Consecutive, nonoverlapping patients with metastatic biopsy-proven
TNBC enrolled on ongoing clinical data and biospecimen banking protocols for
metastatic breast cancer (DFCI#09-204, n = 97; and DFCI#05-246, n = 10) or
collected as part of two clinical trials for patients with metastatic TNBC
(DFCI#12-024 [ruxolitinib; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01562873], n = 14;
and DFCI#12-431 [cabozantinib; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT0173843841],
n = 37) were identified for analyses. TNBC was defined as , 5% staining for
estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2) immunohistochemistry (IHC) 0 to 1+ and/or HER2:
Cep17 fluorescent in situ hybridization ratio , 2.0. Clinicopathologic data were
abstracted from the medical record. Survival events were determined from
medical record or Social Security Death Index. BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline
mutation status was ascertained by medical record review for the receipt of
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-approved germline
testing. All patients received chemotherapy in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or
metastatic setting before first blood draw used in analyses. Use of patients’
clinicopathologic data were institutional review board approved, and all patients
provided written consent.
Sample Processing and DNA Extraction
Venous blood samples were collected in EDTA (BD, Franklin Lakes,
NJ), CellSave Preservative (Cell Search, Raritan, NJ), or Cell-Free DNA
BCT (Streck, Omaha, NE) tubes.42 Blood processing to component parts
within 4 hours of collection, cell-free DNA extraction from plasma, and
DNA quantification were performed as described previously.38 For met-
astatic biopsy samples, . 50% tumor was confirmed via hematoxylin and
eosin staining of fresh frozen samples and then DNA extracted using
Qiagen AllPrep DNA kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD).
Ultra-Low-Pass Whole-Genome Sequencing
Library construction of cfDNA was performed using the Kapa
HyperPrep kit with custom adapters (IDT, Coralville, IA). Three to 20 ng
of cfDNA input (median, 5 ng), or approximately 1,000 to 7,000 haploid
genome equivalents, was used for ultra-low-pass whole-genome sequencing.
Constructed sequencing libraries were pooled (2 mL of each 3 96 per pool)
and sequenced using 100-bp paired-end runs over 1 3 lane on a HiSeq2500
(Illumina, San Diego, CA) to average genome-wide fold coverage of 0.13.
Segment copy number and TFx were derived via ichorCNA.38 Samples were
excluded if the median absolute deviation of copy ratios (2log2 ratio) between
adjacent bins, genome-wide, was . 0.20, suggesting poor-quality sequence
data.
Identification of TNBC Samples in Publicly Available Data Sets
Patients with triple-negative breast cancer were identified in The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA18; n = 166) and METABRIC1 (n = 277) on the basis of
study-reported negative for the ER and progesterone receptor via IHC and HER2-
receptor copy number diploid (GISTIC2.0 value of 0) or IHC 0 to 1. If ER status
was not available, ER status was inferred from RNA expression data.43
Gene-Level Copy Number Analyses
GISTIC2.044,45 output was used for all gene-level copy number
analyses. Segmented data files derived from ichorCNA for mTNBC cfDNA
and publicly available segmented data for METABRIC1 were purity and
ploidy corrected, then input into GISTIC2.044,45 with amplification/
deletion threshold log2ratio . 0.3, confidence level 0.99, and Q-value
threshold 0.05. Genes were defined as gain (GISTIC value 1; corresponds to
three copies) or amplification (GISTIC value 2; corresponds to four or
more copies) versus diploid (GISTIC value 0). TCGA GISTIC2.0 copy
number data were obtained from cBioPortal.46,47
Statistical Analyses and Data Visualization
All statistical analyses and data visualizations were performed in R
version 3.3.1. Contrasts in patient and tumor characteristics were evaluated
using Pearson’s x2 tests. The association of TFx to continuous and categorical
clinicopathologic factors was evaluated using Wilcoxon rank-sum and x2 test
or analysis of variance, respectively. Correlation of cfDNA yield and TFx from
independently processed same-day blood draw samples was calculated using
interclass correlation coefficient. Performance of cfDNA relative to paired
metastatic biopsy—including sensitivity and specificity with biopsy consid-
ered truth—was computed across 1-Mb bins. Correlation among bin-level
copy number calls for all samples was calculated using Spearman correlation
coefficient, and hierarchical clustering was performed using average linkage.
Comparison of Primary Versus Metastatic TNBC
For principal component analysis (PCA), gene-level cfDNA GISTIC
copy number calls were projected onto the METABRIC TNBC PCA co-
ordinate basis and visualized using ggbiplot.48 Comparison in frequency
of gain/amplification (v no gain) and loss/deletion (v no loss) between
metastatic and primary samples was calculated using Fisher’s exact test.
All frequency calculations of copy number calls across the genome were
multiple-testing corrected using Benjamini–Hochberg procedure for false
discovery rate. Volcano plots were generated using ggplot2 package,49
CoMut plots were visualized with GenVisR package,50 and genome-wide
significance plot using qqman package.51
Survival Analyses
All Kaplan-Meier plots were generated using packHV package.52 For
baseline clinicopathologic characteristics, survival was defined as time
from metastatic diagnosis and significance evaluated by log-rank test. For
cfDNA variables, including line of metastatic therapy at blood draw, first
blood draw, and highest TFx blood draw, survival was defined as time
from blood draw. Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards
models were calculated using the survival package.

Cell-Free DNA and Survival in Metastatic TNBC
 November 2016 under institutional review board–approved pro-
tocols at a single institution and abstracted detailed clinico-
pathologic information (Fig 1A; Table 1). All patients received
chemotherapy before blood collection, with most patients having
received neoadjuvant or adjuvant anthracycline and taxane-based
chemotherapy. The median time to follow-up from metastatic
diagnosis was 17 months (range, 0 to 82 months). Overall, this
cohort reflects similar trends to other analyses of mTNBC, in-
cluding worse prognosis for patients initially diagnosed with stage
III relative to lower stage (I or II) disease and improved prognosis
for patients with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations (Appendix
Fig A1, online only).
Copy Number Is Highly Concordant With Metastatic
Biopsy Secimens and Reflects Distinct Subsets of
mTNBCs
Low-coverage whole-genome sequencing provided evaluable
sequencing data for 478 (94.5%) samples that subsequently underwent
copy number analysis and TFx determination via ichorCNA.38 TFx
could be determined for 158 of 164 patients (96.3%); 337 of 478
evaluable samples (70.5%) had detectable tumor DNA above the
lower limit of detection (TFx $ 3%). One hundred one of 158
evaluable patients (63.9%) had at least one sample with TFx $
10%, the prespecified proportion of tumor DNA adequate for
high-confidence copy number calls on the basis of extensive prior
benchmarking.38 Patients with maximum TFx $ 10% had similar
clinicopathologic characteristics relative to patients with maximum
TFx , 10% (Table 1).
We and others have demonstrated robust concordance of copy
number and mutation between metastatic biopsy specimens and
paired cfDNA.38,53 As confirmation in this data set, we performed
low-coverage sequencing of metastatic biopsy samples obtained at
disease progression with concurrent plasma (range, 0 to 7 days
from biopsy; n = 10 pairs). We compared copy number of 1-megabase
segments across the genome using ichorCNA. Altered segments in the
tumor biopsy specimen were detected in cfDNA with high sen-
sitivity (0.86) and specificity (0.90), and, as anticipated, overlap
was not identical,22,54 with instances of private SCNAs present in
cfDNA (Fig 1B).
TNBC is a heterogeneous disease comprising distinct
subtypes.8,55 To investigate patterns of chromosomal alter-
ations, we compared genome-wide copy number profiles for all
cfDNA samples with TFx $ 10%. Hierarchical clustering
revealed two main copy number clusters, with cluster1 sig-
nificantly enriched for patients with mTNBC whose primary
receptor status was non-TNBC (x2 P = .007; Appendix Figs
A2A-A2C, online only). We observed that the gene-level copy
number profile of cluster2 tumors closely mirrors basal-like
IntClust10 pTNBCs in METABRIC1 (Appendix Figs A2D-
A2E). Principal component analysis of METABRIC gene-
level copy number data revealed high concordance of cfDNA
cluster2 with basal-like METABRIC IntClust10 and cfDNA
cluster1 with non-IntClust10 (nonbasal) pTNBCs (Appendix
Fig A2F), although formal IntClust designation requires con-
current gene expression analysis.1
Copy Number Gains in Drivers NOTCH2, AKT2, and
AKT3 Are Enriched in mTNBCs Relative to pTNBCs
We hypothesized that chemoresistant mTNBCs would be
enriched for specific SCNAs relative to chemotherapy-na¨
ıve
pTNBCs, including alterations potentially involved in drug
resistance and/or metastasis. We determined gene-level SCNA
status via GISTIC2.044,45 for the highest TFx ($ 10%) cfDNA
sample per patient with mTNBC (n = 101; Appendix Figs A3A
and A3B, online only). We then identified 20 patients with
mTNBC with at least one cfDNA sample with TFx $ 10%
whose primary tumor underwent targeted panel sequencing56
as part of clinical management. The median time between pri-
mary sample and metastatic cfDNA was 26 months (interquartile
range, 11 to 38 months) with 18 of 20 primary tumors resected.
We compared frequency of gain or loss for 25 cancer-related
genes commonly altered in breast cancer between primary
tumor panel sequencing and metastatic low-coverage cfDNA
sequencing. Four genes demonstrated greater frequency of
gain in mTNBC versus pTNBC samples (NOTCH2 on 1p,

Cell-Free DNA and Survival in Metastatic TNBC
 AKT3 on 1q, GATA3 on 10p, AKT2 on 19q; Fisher’s exact P , .05),
whereas four genes demonstrated single copy loss more frequently
in pTNBC than mTNBC (CDKN2A on 9p, PTEN on 10q, RB1 on
13q, NF1 on 17q; Fisher’s exact P , .05; Appendix Figs A3C and
A3D).
To evaluate SCNA differences in a large number of primary
versus metastatic TNBCs, we identified pTNBCs in publicly available
data sets METABRIC1 and TCGA18 (total, n = 433) and determined
gene-level copy number status in both data sets via GISTIC2.0 to
facilitate uniform comparison. Overall, altered regions were re-
markably concordant between pTNBC and mTNBC (Figs 2A and
2B); however, mTNBCs demonstrated greater SCNA frequency of
both commonly altered regions (1q, 7q, 8q) and less commonly
altered regions (11q, 18q, 19p; Appendix Fig A3E). A subset of genes
was altered more frequently in mTNBC relative to pTNBC, including
high-frequency (. 50% of samples) gains in MYC (8q), AKT3 (1q),
GATA3 (10p), NOTCH2 (1p), EZH2 (7q), BRAF (7q), and MET (7q;
Fisher’s exact, genome-wide false discovery rate (FDR) correction
P , .05; Figs 2A-2C; Data Supplement). Four genes were enriched in
mTNBC relative to pTNBC both in paired samples and across co-
horts: gains in GATA3 and drivers NOTCH2, AKT2, and AKT3.
Interestingly, the genome-wide percentage of genes altered was not
significantly increased in mTNBC relative to pTNBC, although there
was greater heterogeneity among primary tumors (Fig 2D).
Chromosomal Gains of 18q11 and 19p13 Are
Associated With Poor Survival in mTNBC
Little is known regarding genomic determinants of TNBC
metastatic survival. Focusing on mTNBC-enriched SCNAs (Fig
3A), we calculated the Cox proportional hazard ratio of each gene
for metastatic survival (Fig 3B; Data Supplement). Only a subset
of mTNBC-enriched loci were prognostic in the metastatic setting.
Unexpectedly, the loci most strongly associated with poor metastatic

 survival, 18q11 and 19p13, have never previously associated with
TNBC survival. More than half of mTNBCs harbored gain/
amplification of 18q11, 19p13, or both, significantly more
frequent than in pTNBCs (x2 P , .001; Appendix Fig A4A, online
only). Gain/amplification of both 18q11 and 19p13 was strongly
associated with worse survival in univariate analyses and multi-
variable Cox proportional hazard models including clinicopath-
ologic factors and TFx (hazard ratio, 3.30; 95% CI, 1.30 to 8.38;
P = .012) and was also associated with poor prognosis in pTNBCs
(log-rank P = .038; Fig A4B-A4E).
Tumor Fraction of cfDNA Is an Independent Prognostic
Biomarker in mTNBC
Our approach offers a tumor fraction calculation on the basis
of SCNAs detected in cfDNA without a priori knowledge of tumor
mutation status.38 To evaluate reproducibility, two plasma samples
were drawn in a single venipuncture and fractionated in in-
dependent laboratories for 11 patients. Data showed high TFx
concordance of paired samples (intraclass correlation coefficient =
0.984) and nearly identical copy number profiles despite variable
cfDNA yield (Appendix Fig A5A-A5D, online only).

Cell-Free DNA and Survival in Metastatic TNBC
 Tumor fraction measurement using ichorCNA has a broad
dynamic range, both within individuals and among distinct pa-
tients. Within-patient TFx variability is illustrated by a single
patient on a clinical trial of cabozantinib,41 who demonstrated a
TFx nadir of 3.5% while responding to therapy with a maximum
TFx of 48.2% at progression (Fig 4A). Evaluating a first sentinel
blood draw, this cohort demonstrated a diverse range of TFx
from , 3% to 77.2% (Fig 4B). We hypothesized that metastases to
more highly vascular organs could be associated with higher TFx,
and indeed the presence of liver metastasis was associated with
significantly higher TFx in both the sentinel draw and maximum
TFx draw (Appendix Fig A6A-A6B, online only), remaining sig-
nificant when adjusting for characteristics in a multivariate model
(Appendix Fig A6A-A6B).

Stover et al
 Allele fraction of tumor mutations detected in cfDNA is
suggested to be a prognostic for metastatic breast cancer.28 We
evaluated prognostic association of TFx at a prespecified thresh-
old $ 10% on the basis of . 2,400 tumor/normal in silico ad-
mixtures of varying sequencing coverage and tumor fractions that
demonstrated optimal SCNA prediction performance at a tumor
fraction $ 10%.38 In this cohort, TFx $ 10% on a patient’s first
blood draw was associated with significantly shorter survival,
median 6.4 months versus 15.9 months (log-rank P , .001; Fig
4C). TFx remained an independent prognostic factor in a multi-
variate Cox proportional hazards model (hazard ratio, 2.14; 95%
CI, 1.40 to 3.28; P , .001; Fig 4D) and also in sensitivity analyses
including only patients whose primary tumor was TNBC (n = 121)
and with TFx as a continuous variable (Appendix Fig A6C-A6E).
DISCUSSION
We present the largest genomic characterization of mTNBC to our
knowledge. Using a cfDNA-exclusive approach relevant for most
patients with mTNBC, we demonstrate that TFx is a robust,
minimally invasive independent prognostic biomarker in mTNBC.
pTNBC and mTNBC exhibit remarkably similar copy number
profiles, yet we identified known cancer drivers among SCNAs
enriched in mTNBC relative to pTNBC.
Allele fraction of known mutations detected in cfDNA is
suggested to be prognostic but is dependent on knowledge of
existing tumor mutations and has not been evaluated in a large
cohort of mTNBCs.28 Our approach evaluates TFx without a priori
tumor mutation status and is evaluable in the vast majority of patients
with mTNBC. We demonstrate that TFx is a genomic biomarker for
mTNBC independent of standard clincopathologic characteristics in
a large modern cohort. Patients with higher tumor fraction (TFx $
10%) had significantly inferior survival but showed no significant
differences in baseline characteristics relative to patients with lower TFx.
Patients with higher TFx were more likely to have documented liver
metastases, potentially associated with highly vascular organs or distinct
features of TNBC that metastasizes to the liver. In support of further
testing of this approach in clinical practice, we will be launching
a prospective cohort study to further investigate mTNBC TFx dynamics
while on therapy and subsequent association with response to standard
or experimental therapies. Future efforts may allow minimally invasive
analysis of clinically relevant mutational signatures, such as homologous
recombination deficiency or microsatellite instability.
Several cancer types have been shown to evolve with pro-
gressive collection of mutations over time and on therapy.2,34,53 It
has been hypothesized that primary tumors with genomic in-
stability such as TNBC will collect immense numbers of genomic
alterations in the metastatic setting after chemotherapy. Surpris-
ingly, we demonstrate no significant difference in percent ge-
nome altered and remarkably similar patterns of chromosomal
alterations when comparing more than 100 mTNBCs with more
than 400 pTNBCs. This suggests that large-scale chromosomal
events are rare in metastatic development and supports prior work
demonstrating that most SCNAs occur early in tumorigenesis in
TNBCs.57,58

Cell-Free DNA and Survival in Metastatic TNBC
 Despite few large-scale SCNA changes between primary and
metastatic tumors, we identify certain loci enriched in mTNBCs
relative to paired primary and/or large cohorts of pTNBCs. We
identify a novel association of 18q11 and 19p13 gains with met-
astatic survival that is independent of both clinicopathologic
factors as well as TFx. Gain or amplification of both regions
identifies a subset of TNBC rapid progressors with remarkably
poor survival in the metastatic and also the primary setting. Both
18q1159 and 19p1360,61 include known breast cancer risk loci.59,60
19p13 is associated with increased breast cancer risk, specifically
among BRCA1 mutation carriers,60 and associated specifically with
ER-negative61 and TNBC60 in the general population. An assess-
ment of focal events, recently shown to be a driving force in
prostate cancer,54 might lead to identification of additional prog-
nostic SCNAs.
Our study involved a modern cohort representing current
standard treatment approaches, with 86% of patients without
distant metastasis at diagnosis having received anthracycline
and taxane-based (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. Over the first
20 months from metastatic diagnosis, patients initially diagnosed
with stage III disease are more likely to die as a result of their
disease relative to patients diagnosed with stage I or II or de novo
metastatic disease, supporting prior epidemiologic studies.5 Pa-
tients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations have improved prognosis.
The patients in our cohort were relatively young, with more than
half of the patients’ primary diagnoses before age 50 years, pri-
marily wild-type for germline BRCA1/2 (15% with documented
mutation), and most patients were white, an important limitation
of this study.
In summary, we illustrate a framework for minimally invasive
genomic characterization of metastatic cancer and subsequent
integration with clinicopathologic data and patient outcomes. This
analysis provides the most comprehensive genomic profile of
metastatic TNBC SCNAs to date, to our knowledge, and suggests
that determining cfDNA TFx via a blood test provides important
prognostic information beyond standard clinicopathologic factors.
This approach has the potential to reveal clinically useful bio-
markers while identifying unique genomic features of metastatic
cancer and may advance our understanding of metastasis, drug
resistance, and novel therapeutic targets.

10%. Colors bars indicate unique patients. (B) Association of factors with metastatic TNBC Cluster. (C) Proportion of samples by primary receptor status of two largest
clusters from. Chi-square test of independence on proportions indicated. (D) Gene-level copy number frequency plots of primary TNBCs from METABRIC, stratified by
study-reported IntClust10 (bottom) versus other IntClust groups (top). (E) Gene-level copy number frequency plots of metastatic TNBCs from cfDNA, stratified by
metastatic TNBC Cluster from Figure 1C. Gain and loss frequencies are shown in red and blue, respectively. Deletion frequencies are negated for comparison. (F) Principal
component analysis (PCA) of gene-level copy number calls for METABRIC1 triple-negative breast cancers (n = 123) with projection of gene-level copy number calls for
mTNBC from plasma (n = 101) onto the PCA coordinate basis. Samples were designated as basal-like IntClust10 versus other (non-basal) IntClust for METABRIC or
Cluster1 versus Cluster2 for mTNBC.

Fig A5. Tumor fraction and copy number profiles are reproducible from independent blood draws. (A) Schematic of independently processed same-day blood draws. Two
separate blood tubes from a single venipuncture had plasma separated and were frozen in independent laboratories. Equivalent volumes of plasma then underwent DNA
extraction, library construction, low-coverage sequencing, and TFx calculation via ichorCNA. (B) Total cell-free DNA yield (ng per mL plasma; left panel) and TFx (right panel)
per patient. (C-D) Representative ichorCNA copy number plots from same-day blood draws for the two patients with the highest detected TFx.

Fig A6. Tumor fraction is associated with liver metastasis and metastatic survival in patients with primary TNBC. (A) Multiple linear regression of TFx with covariates. (B)
TFx by presence or absence of liver metastasis in first blood sample collected per patient (left) or maximum TFx per patient (right). Boxplots indicate 25th-75th percentiles
with median indicated by central line and whiskers representing 1.5 times interquartile range. (C) Kaplan-Meier curve of survival from first blood draw stratified by TFx above
versus below 10% for only those patients with primary TNBC. (D) Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model of TFx above versus below 10% for only those patients with
primary TNBC. (E) Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model of TFx as a continuous variable. Hazard ratio for TFx reported based on increments of 10%.
