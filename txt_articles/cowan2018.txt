INTRODUCTION Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell neoplasm with substantial morbidity
and mortality. A comprehensive description of the global burden of MM is needed to help
direct health policy, resource allocation, research, and patient care.
OBJECTIVE To describe the burden of MM and the availability of effective therapies for 21
world regions and 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016.
DESIGN AND SETTING We report incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY)
estimates from the Global Burden of Disease 2016 study. Data sources include vital
registration system, cancer registry, drug availability, and survey data for stem cell transplant
rates. We analyzed the contribution of aging, population growth, and changes in incidence
rates to the overall change in incident cases from 1990 to 2016 globally, by sociodemographic
index (SDI) and by region. We collected data on approval of lenalidomide and bortezomib
worldwide.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Multiple myeloma mortality; incidence; years lived with
disabilities; years of life lost; and DALYs by age, sex, country, and year.
RESULTS Worldwide in 2016 there were 138 509 (95% uncertainty interval [UI],
121 000-155 480) incident cases of MM with an age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of 2.1
per 100 000 persons (95% UI, 1.8-2.3). Incident cases from 1990 to 2016 increased by 126%
globally and by 106% to 192% for all SDI quintiles. The 3 world regions with the highest ASIR
of MM were Australasia, North America, and Western Europe. Multiple myeloma caused 2.1
million (95% UI, 1.9-2.3 million) DALYs globally in 2016. Stem cell transplantation is routinely
available in higher-income countries but is lacking in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of the
Middle East. In 2016, lenalidomide and bortezomib had been approved in 73 and 103
countries, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Incidence of MM is highly variable among countries but has
increased uniformly since 1990, with the largest increase in middle and low-middle SDI
countries. Access to effective care is very limited in many countries of low socioeconomic
development, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Global health policy priorities for MM are to
improve diagnostic and treatment capacity in low and middle income countries and to ensure
affordability of effective medications for every patient. Research priorities are to elucidate
underlying etiological factors explaining the heterogeneity in myeloma incidence.

ultiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma cell neo-
plasmwithsubstantialmorbidityandmortality,char-
acterizedbyendorgandamage—renalimpairment,hy-
percalcemia, lytic bony lesions, and anemia. With the
developmentofbettertherapies,myelomahaschangedfroman
untreatable ailment to one that is still not curable but treatable
with mostly outpatient therapy. Myeloma treatment has im-
proved substantially over the past decade. The first major ad-
vance was the development of autologous stem cell transplant
(ASCT)inthe1980sand1990s.1So-callednovelagentswerefirst
developedinthelate1990sandearly2000s—beginningwiththe
“IMIDs”(thalidomideandlenalidomide)andfollowedbythepro-
teasome inhibitors (PIs).2 More recently, monoclonal antibod-
ies,suchasdaratumumabandelotuzumab,andhistonedeacety-
latingagents,suchaspanobinostat,havealsobeenapprovedby
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).2
Myeloma is unique as a cancer because basic diagnostic
testing includes only a complete blood cell count with differ-
ential, basic metabolic panel; serum calcium, serum and urine
proteinelectrophoresis;andosseoussurvey,allofwhichshould
be accessible in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).3,4
Many advanced tests, such as the serum-free light-chain as-
say, fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography (FDG
PET) scan, cytogenetics, and fluorescence in situ hybridiza-
tion (FISH) may not be available. Because of this, resource-
stratified guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of MM
have been developed.4 Another unique feature of myeloma is
that treatment can be delivered almost exclusively in the out-
patient setting (with the exception of ASCT).
Standard treatment for myeloma is largely dependent on
patient fitness and underlying health status. For those in good
health and younger than 70 to 75 years, the preferred treat-
ment for newly diagnosed patients with myeloma comprises
a triplet novel agent regimen, typically including an IMID and
PI in combination with glucocorticoids, followed by ASCT and
maintenance therapy with low-dose IMID or PI.5,6 For those
unable to undergo ASCT, standard therapy includes induc-
tion with novel agents and low-dose maintenance therapy.7
Despite improvements in the care of patients with my-
eloma, these advances have largely delivered better out-
comes to patients in high-income countries. In many LMICs,
delivery of cancer care is often hindered by lack of access to
general and specialized health care, diagnostics, and ad-
vanced treatments, like novel agents, radiation oncology, and
stem cell transplantation, leading to poor outcomes. In stud-
ies of patients with myeloma treated in Nigeria, lack of access
to affordable health care, late presentation, and inadequate
treatment were suggested as common factors contributing to
poor outcomes, with a 5-year survival of only 7.6%.8,9

Methods
Flowcharts describing the process to estimate mortality, inci-
dence, prevalence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of
lifelost(YLLs),anddisability-adjustedlife-years(DALYs)canbe
found in eFigures 1 and 2 in the Supplement. Methods for the
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study and the cancer estima-
tion have been described in detail previously.3,10-12 To esti-
mate myeloma mortality, we used vital registration (VR) sys-
tem as well as cancer registry (CR) data. Data sources used for
myeloma mortality can be found in the GBD source tool (http:
//ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2016/data-input-sources). The VR
andCRdatawereprocessedinmultiplesteps.Majoradjustments
includedtheredistributionofundefinedcodes(“garbagecodes”)
orcodesthatcannotbeconsideredtorefertounderlyingcauses
of death, and mapping of different coding systems to GBD
causes.13 Codes from the International Statistical Classification
of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-
10) mapped to the GBD cause “multiple myeloma” were C88
(“malignant immunoproliferative diseases and certain other
B-celllymphomas”)andC90(“multiplemyelomaandmalignant
plasma cell neoplasms”). Cancer registry incidence data were
transformedtomortalityestimatesbyusingseparatelymodeled
mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs). The VR data were
combined with the mortality estimates that were derived from
CRMMincidencedataandusedasinputforanensemblemodel
of mixed-effects linear models and spatiotemporal Gaussian
process regression models for MM cause fractions and death
rates.14 Covariates used in the models can be found in the
Appendix(eTable1intheSupplement).Myelomamortalitywas
adjusted to fit into the separately estimated all-cause mortality
in a process called “CodCorrect,” which is an algorithm that
scales single causes of death to all-cause mortality and child
causes to parent causes.10 The YLLs were estimated by
calculating the difference between a standard life expectancy
and the age at death.13 Final MM mortality estimates were
divided by MIR, resulting in incidence estimates.
Key Points
Question What is the burden of multiple myeloma globally and by
country, how has it changed over time, and how widely available
are treatments for this disease?
Findings Myeloma incident cases and deaths increased from
1990 to 2016, with middle-income countries contributing the
most to this increase. Treatment availability is very limited in
countries with low socioeconomic development.
Meaning Marked variation in myeloma incidence and mortality
across countries highlights the need to improve access to
diagnosis and effective therapy and to expand research on
etiological determinants of myeloma.

 Myeloma survival was estimated by scaling GBD loca-
tions between a theoretical best-case and worst-case sce-
nario using the MIR as a scaling factor. For each incidence co-
hort, 10-year prevalence was estimated using the modeled
survival. Ten-year myeloma prevalence was divided into 4 se-
quelae: (1) diagnosis and treatment (7 months),15 (2) remis-
sion (remaining duration after taking into account the other
sequelae), (3) metastatic and/or disseminated phase (37
months),16 and (4) terminal phase (1 month). Each sequela
prevalence was multiplied with a distinct disability weight,
which can be found in eTable 2 in the Supplement, and these
were summed to generate YLDs.13 DALYs were calculated as
the sum of YLDs and YLLs.11 Rates are reported per 100 000
person-years with a 95% uncertainty interval (UI) reported in
parentheses.Fortheagestandardization,theGBDworldpopu-
lation standard was used.17 For measuring availability of ef-
fective therapies, lenalidomide global approval information as
of 2016 was provided by the Australian Therapeutic Goods
Administration.18 Bortezomib global approval was deter-
mined via personal communication with Takeda Oncology
(email communication; Takeda Oncology; May 3, 2018). Data
on stem cell transplant availability were reported using a prior
publication by the World Bone Marrow Transplant Society.19
To estimate the effect of population growth on myeloma in-
cidence, we applied the population size of 2016 onto the rate,
sex, and age structure of 1990. To estimate the effect of aging
on incident cases, we applied the age structure of 2016 onto
the rate, sex distribution, and population size of 1990. To es-
timate the effect of changing age-specific incidence rates on
theincidentcases,weappliedtheincidenceratesfor1990onto

Results
DatausedfortheMMestimatesincluded16 005site-yearsfrom

cidence rate (ASIR) of 2.1 per 100 000 persons (95% UI, 1.8-

million) DALYs at the global level in 2016, with an age-
standardizedrateof30.5(95%UI,27.4-33.9)DALYsper100 000
person-years (eTable 3 in the Supplement). From 1990 to 2016,
MM incident cases increased by 126%, and deaths increased
by 94% (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Among SDI quintiles, the
largest increase (192%) was seen in middle SDI countries (from
7974 [95% UI, 7233-8821] in 1990 to 23 273 [95% UI, 21 136-
26 947] in 2016). Of the 126% increase in incident cases at the
global level, population growth contributed 40.4%, an aging
world population contributed 52.9%, and increases in age-
specific incidence rates contributed 32.6% (eTable 4 in the
Supplement). Among the regions, the largest increase in inci-
dent cases from 1990 to 2016 was seen in East Asia (China,
NorthKorea,andTaiwan),withariseof262%(from4760[95%
UI, 4271-5575] in 1990 to 17 218 [95% UI, 14 482-19 093] in
2016). The largest contributor to this increase was a rise in age-
specific incidence rates (contributing 157%), followed by an ag-
ingpopulation(contributing85%)andpopulationgrowth(con-
tributing 20%) (eTable 4 in the Supplement).

plantation (for all indications, not just MM) were Israel (814),
Italy (671), Germany (665), Sweden (625), and the Nether-
lands (614) (Figure 2). Some regions of the world lack access
to stem cell transplantation entirely, particularly sub-
Saharan Africa (with the exception of South Africa). With re-
spect to drug availability, as of 2016, out of 195 countries and
territories, lenalidomide (Revlimid) had been approved in 73
countries and bortezomib (Velcade) in 103 countries (Figure 3).
Notably, neither drug has been approved in most countries in
sub-Saharan Africa and some countries in Central Asia.

respect to these differences between incidence of MM in high-
incomeandLMIC,afulldiscussionofthepredispositionformy-
eloma is beyond the scope of this report, but known risk factors
includeantecedentdiagnosisofmonoclonalgammopathyofun-
determined significance or smoldering myeloma, and possible
occupational risk factors.22 In addition, there have been re-
cently described autosomal germline mutations that can pre-
disposeapatienttoMM.23Atleastsomeofthedifferencesinin-
cidence may be due to lack of diagnostic abilities in lower SDI
countries compared with high SDI countries and do not neces-
sarily reflect differences in disease biology (eFigure 6 in the
Supplement shows a map of the SDI quintiles). Supporting this
hypothesis is the fact that the disease burden of MM in African
Americans in the United States is markedly higher than that of
European Americans in the United States, yet the disease bur-
den among Africans living in Africa is among the lowest in the
world,asshowninourstudyandinpreviousstudies.24,25Toex-
plain the heterogeneity in incidence, collaborative research
within the global oncology community is required on 2 fronts:
the basic research question of differences in underlying dis-
ease biology, and the population health question of under-
ascertainment. Despite the heterogeneous geographical bur-
den of myeloma, time trends show that incident cases of
myeloma have increased in all regions and have more than
doubled for all SDI quintiles from 1990 to 2016. Global inci-
dent cases of myeloma increased by 126%, with aging contrib-
uting 52.9%. This is in line with the increase seen for other
cancers that predominantly affect an older population. Pros-
tate cancer cases at the global level, for example, increased by
217% from 1990 to 2013.26 We also showed that among SDI
quintiles, the largest increase of 192% in incidence cases was
seen in middle-SDI countries with an aging population and
rising age-specific rates contributing equally. Among regions,
the largest increase of 262% was seen in East Asia, mostly
from a rise in age-specific incidence rates. Given the lack of
known strong risk factors for myeloma, research in locations
with rapidly rising incidence rates might help to identify pre-
disposing factors and guide future preventative strategies.
We have also described an improvement in ASDRs for MM
from 1990 to 2016 in high-income SDI regions despite increas-
ing incidence rates, which is likely reflective of improvements
in treatments. Novel agents, such as PIs and IMIDs, in addition
to high-dose melphalan and ASCT, have changed the therapeu-
tic landscape, with improvement in 5-year survival rates from
25.1% in 1975 to 1979 to 52.7% in 2009 in the United States.7,27
With respect to availability of effective therapies, we de-
scribed the approval status of bortezomib and lenalidomide
and the availability of ASCT as a surrogate measure, although
our ability to assess true “availability”—as determined by fac-

governments to pay for cancer treatments—is limited. Prior re-
search has demonstrated major differences in affordability of
importantcancerdrugsaroundtheworld—bortezomibwasspe-
cifically examined in this analysis.28 Nonetheless, 2 drugs that
are now considered standard of care, lenalidomide and
bortezomib, have not been approved in some African and
Middle Eastern countries, and it is notable that there are no
stem cell transplant centers in sub-Saharan Africa, with the ex-
ceptionofSouthAfrica.Thus,onagloballeveltherearemarked
discrepancies in the availability of effective therapies. In ad-
dition to ensuring universal access to health care, as speci-
fied in target 3.8 of the Sustainable Development Goals, it is
imperative to at least ensure access to highly effective
medications.29 Initiatives like the market access agreements
negotiated by the American Cancer Society and the Clinton
Health Access Initiative with Pfizer Inc and Cipla Inc to ex-
pand access to essential cancer medications are hopefully re-
flective of improved affordability, as has been the case with an-
tiretroviral treatments for HIV/AIDS.30
Limitations
Limitationsofourstudyarethatdatainformingthemodelstoes-

taintyaroundourestimatesintheselocationsisthereforelarge.

our attempts to obtain data on drug sales from pharmaceutical
companieswereunsuccessful,andthereforewecouldreportonly

neric drugs like thalidomide, we chose to report approval rates
oflenalidomideandbortezomibwiththeunderstandingthattha-
lidomide might represent an effective treatment options in
countriesthathavenotapprovedlenalidomide.Otherquestions,
suchaswhichdrugsareavailablethroughgovernment-sponsored
health plans, which phases of the disease the drug is approved
in, which combinations are approved, were not specifically ex-
amined, and thus we were limited in making more definitive
conclusions about drug “access” beyond regulatory approval.
As an important example, within the European Union (EU), the
EuropeanMedicinesAgency(EMA)isresponsiblefortheautho-
rization of medicines in EU countries. The EMA has approved
lenalidomide for use in the EU; however, member countries
have individually decided whether the drug will be paid for by
governmental health insurance. Thus, although marketing ap-
proval may be present, it does not guarantee that a drug will be
covered by insurances or that patients can afford the cost. With

ment of effective treatments for myeloma.
Conclusions
Although more common in high SDI countries, myeloma is a
global disease, and there has been a marked increase in inci-
dent cases from 1990 to 2016, predominantly in middle SDI
countries and East Asia. Approval for effective drugs and
stem cell transplantation options are lacking in many low-
SDI countries. Collaborative global efforts are needed to
ensure that every patient with myeloma is being diagnosed
and has access to effective treatment. Further research is
needed to determine the reasons behind the observed
heterogeneity in disease burden.
