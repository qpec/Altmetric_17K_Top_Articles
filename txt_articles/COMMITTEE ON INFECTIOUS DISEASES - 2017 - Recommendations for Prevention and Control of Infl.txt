 Recommendations for Prevention 
and Control of Influenza in 
Children, 2017–2018
COMMITTEE ON INFECTIOUS DISEASES
This statement updates the recommendations for routine use of the seasonal influenza 
vaccine and antiviral medications for the prevention and treatment of influenza in 
children. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends annual seasonal influenza 
immunization for everyone 6 months and older, including children and adolescents. 
Highlights for the upcoming 2017–2018 season include the following:
1. Annual universal influenza immunization is indicated with either a trivalent or 
quadrivalent (no preference) inactivated vaccine;
2. The 2017–2018 influenza A (H1N1) vaccine strain differs from that contained in the 
2016–2017 seasonal vaccines. The 2017–2018 influenza A (H3N2) vaccine strain and 
influenza B vaccine strains included in the trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines are 
the same as those contained in the 2016–2017 seasonal vaccines:
a. trivalent vaccine contains an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an  
A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (B/
Victoria lineage); and
b. quadrivalent vaccine contains an additional B virus (B/Phuket/3073/2013-like 
virus [B/Yamagata lineage]);
3. Quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) is not recommended for 
use in any setting in the United States during the 2017–2018 influenza season. This 
interim recommendation, originally made in 2016, followed observational data from 
the US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network revealing that LAIV4 performed 
poorly against influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses in recent influenza seasons;
4. All children with an egg allergy of any severity can receive an influenza vaccine 
without any additional precautions beyond those recommended for any vaccine;
5. All health care personnel should receive an annual seasonal influenza vaccine, a 
crucial step in preventing influenza and reducing health care–associated influenza 
infections, because health care personnel often care for individuals at high risk for 
influenza-related complications; and
6. Pediatricians should attempt to promptly identify children suspected of having 
influenza infection for timely initiation of antiviral treatment, when indicated, to 
reduce morbidity and mortality. Best results are seen when treated within 48 hours 
of symptom onset.

POLICY STATEMENT

www.aappublications.org/news
Downloaded from 
 The American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) recommends annual seasonal 
influenza vaccination for everyone 
6 months and older, including 
children and adolescents, during the 
2017–2018 influenza season. Special 
effort should be made to vaccinate 
individuals in the following groups:
 
• All children, including infants born 
preterm, 6 months and older (on 
the basis of chronologic age) with 
conditions that increase the risk 
of complications from influenza 
(eg, children with chronic medical 
conditions such as pulmonary 
diseases like asthma, metabolic 
diseases like diabetes mellitus, 
hemoglobinopathies like sickle 
cell disease, hemodynamically 
significant cardiac disease, 
immunosuppression, or neurologic 
and neurodevelopmental 
disorders);
 
• All household contacts and out-of-
home care providers of children 
with high-risk conditions or 
younger than 5 years, especially 
infants younger than 6 months;
 
• Children and adolescents (6 
months through 18 years of age) 
receiving an aspirin- or salicylate-
containing medication, which 
places them at risk for Reye 
syndrome after influenza virus 
infection;
 
• American Indian/Alaskan native 
children;
 
• All health care personnel (HCP);
 
• All child care providers and staff; and
 
• All women who are pregnant, 
are considering pregnancy, are 
in the postpartum period, or are 
breastfeeding during the influenza 
season.
KEy POINTS RELEvANT FOR ThE 2017–
2018 INFLUENzA SEASON
1. The annual seasonal influenza 
vaccine is recommended 
for everyone 6 months and 
older, including children 
and adolescents, during the 
2017–2018 influenza season. 
It is important that household 
contacts and out-of-home care 
providers of children younger 
than 5 years, especially infants 
younger than 6 months, and 
children of any age at high 
risk for complications from 
influenza (eg, children with 
chronic medical conditions 
such as pulmonary diseases 
like asthma, metabolic 
diseases like diabetes mellitus, 
hemoglobinopathies like sickle 
cell disease, hemodynamically 
significant cardiac disease, 
immunosuppression, 
or neurologic and 
neurodevelopmental disorders) 
receive the annual influenza 
vaccine. In the United States, 
more than two-thirds of children 
younger than 6 years and 
almost all children 6 years and 
older spend significant time 
in child care or school settings 
outside the home. Exposure to 
groups of children increases the 
risk of contracting infectious 
diseases. Children younger 
than 2 years are at increased 
risk of hospitalization and 
complications attributable to 
influenza. School-aged children 
bear a large influenza disease 
burden and have a significantly 
higher chance of seeking

 influenza-related medical 
care compared with healthy 
adults. Reducing influenza 
virus transmission (eg, by using 
appropriate hand hygiene 
and respiratory hygiene and/
or cough etiquette) among 
children who attend out-of-
home child care or school has 
been shown to decrease the 
burden of childhood influenza 
and transmission of influenza 
virus to household contacts and 
community members of all ages.
2. The 2016–2017 influenza 
season was moderate overall, 
and influenza A (H3N2) 
viruses predominated. 
Severity indicators were within 
the range of what has been 
observed during previous H3N2-
predominant seasons, which 
have been associated with more 
severe illness and mortality, 
especially in older individuals 
and younger children, compared 
with seasons during which H1N1 
or B viruses predominated. 
The start of the season was 
typical in the United States, 
with increasing activity noted in 
mid-December 2016 and peak 
activity in late February. The 
majority of circulating strains 
matched vaccine strains well. 
Pediatric hospitalizations and 
deaths caused by influenza 
vary by the predominant 
circulating strain and from one 
season to the next (Table 1). 
Historically, 80% to 85% of 
pediatric deaths have occurred 
in unvaccinated children 6 
months and older. Influenza 
vaccination is associated with 
reduced risk of laboratory-
confirmed influenza-related 
pediatric death. In a recent 
case-cohort analysis comparing 
vaccination uptake among 
laboratory-confirmed influenza-
associated pediatric deaths with 
estimated vaccination coverage 
among pediatric cohorts in the 
United States, Flannery et al1 
found that only 26% of cases 
received a vaccine before illness 
onset, compared with average 
vaccination coverage of 48%. 
In the past 10 seasons, the 
rates of influenza-associated 
hospitalization for children 
younger than 5 years have 
always exceeded the rates for 
children 5 through 17 years of 
age. However, among healthy 
children hospitalized with 
influenza B, those 10 to 16 years 
of age were found to be at the 
highest risk for admission to the 
ICU. As of August 19, 2017, the 
following data were reported by 
the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) during the 
2016–2017 influenza season: 
 
• 104 laboratory-confirmed 
influenza-associated pediatric 
deaths occurred:
 
⚬ 66 of these were associated 
with influenza A viruses;
 
⚬ 37 of these were associated 
with influenza B viruses; and
 
⚬ 1 of these was associated 
with an undetermined type of 
influenza virus.
Flannery et al1 found that more 
than half of pediatric deaths 
from 2010 through 2014 had ≥1 
underlying medical condition 
with an increased risk of severe 
influenza-related complications; 
notably, only 1 in 3 of these 
at-risk children had been 
vaccinated.
Although children with certain 
conditions are at a higher risk 
of complications, 53.7% of the 
deaths during the 2016–2017 
influenza season occurred 
in children with no high-risk 
underlying medical condition. 
Among children hospitalized 
with influenza and for whom 
medical record data were 
available, ∼41% had no recorded 
underlying condition, whereas 
∼29% had underlying asthma 
or reactive airway disease 
(Fig 1). In a recent study of 
hospitalizations for influenza A 
versus B, the odds of mortality

influenza B than with A and

underlying health conditions. 
3. The AAP continues to 
recommend that quadrivalent 
live attenuated influenza 
vaccine (LAIV4) not be used in 
any setting during the 2017–
2018 season because of low 
effectiveness against influenza 
A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses in 
the United States in recent 
seasons. In all pediatric age 
groups for the influenza seasons 
from 2013 through 2016, LAIV4 
did not have any statistically 
significant benefit in preventing 
influenza (all 95% confidence 
intervals [CIs] cross 0), whereas 
inactivated influenza vaccine 
(IIV) provided statistically 
significant protection, albeit 
to differing degrees by season 
(Table 2). Children who received 
LAIV4 were almost 4 times 
more likely to become infected 
with an influenza virus than 
those who received IIV. No data 
have been published during the 
2016–2017 season regarding 
laboratory-confirmed influenza 
to warrant rescinding this 
recommendation. Additional 
research will help determine if 
the interim recommendation 
that LAIV4 should not be used 
in any setting will continue for 
subsequent influenza seasons. 
Development of alternative live 
attenuated influenza vaccines 
is also being investigated. 
Current efforts should be on 
the administration of IIV for 
all children and adolescents, 
particularly those with 
underlying medical conditions

of complications from influenza. 
4. Vaccination remains the best 
available preventive measure 
against influenza. Given the 
unpredictable nature of influenza 
each season, any licensed and 
age-appropriate IIV available 
should be used. The vaccine 
strains are predicted to match 
the circulating strains with the 
intent of providing optimal 
protection. Vaccination is 
effective in reducing outpatient 
medical visits for illness caused 
by circulating influenza viruses 
by 50% to 75%. The universal 
administration of the seasonal 
vaccine to everyone 6 months 
and older is the best strategy 
available for preventing illness 
from influenza. There is notable 
room for improvement in 
influenza vaccination, because 
overall influenza vaccination 
rates have been suboptimal 
during the past 7 seasons in 
both children (percentages 
in the mid- to high- 50s) and 
adults (percentages in the 
low- to mid- 40s). A child’s 
likelihood of being immunized 
according to recommendations 
appears to be associated with 
the immunization practices 
of their parents. The authors 
of 1 study found that children 
were 2.77 times (95% CI: 2.74 
to 2.79) more likely to also 
be immunized for seasonal 
influenza if their parents were 
immunized. When parents who 
were previously not immunized 
had received immunization for 
seasonal influenza, their children 
were 5.44 times (95% CI: 5.35 
to 5.53) more likely to become 
immunized for influenza.
5. Both trivalent and 
quadrivalent IIVs are 
available in the United States 
for the 2017–2018 season. 
To vaccinate as many people 
as possible for this influenza 
season, neither inactivated 
vaccine formulation is preferred 
over the other. Although 
manufacturers anticipate an 
adequate supply of quadrivalent 
vaccine, pediatricians should 
administer whichever 
formulation is available in their 
communities. Both formulations 
contain an A/Michigan/45/2015 
(H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an 
A/HongKong/4801/2014 
(H3N2)-like virus, and a B/
Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (B/
Victoria lineage). Quadrivalent 
influenza vaccines also contain 
the B/Phuket/3073/2013-like 
virus (B/Yamagata lineage). 
The influenza A (H1N1) virus in 
both formulations differs from 
that contained in the 2016–2017 
seasonal vaccines.
6. The number of seasonal 
influenza vaccine doses 
to be administered in the 
2017–2018 influenza season 
depends on the child’s 
age at the time of the first 
administered dose and vaccine 
history (Fig 2). 
 
• Influenza vaccines are not 
licensed for administration to 
infants younger than 6 months;
 
• Children 9 years and older need 
only 1 dose; and
 
• Children 6 months through 8 
years of age:
 
⚬ Need 2 doses if they have 
received fewer than 2 doses of 
any trivalent or quadrivalent 
influenza vaccine (IIV or 
LAIV4) before July 1, 2017. 
The interval between the 2 
doses should be at least 4 
weeks; and
 
⚬ Require only 1 dose if they 
have previously received 2 
or more total doses of any 
trivalent or quadrivalent

Despite recent evidence for

receipt of LAIV4 in the past is

currently are no data that

children who received 2 or 
more doses of LAIV4 before 
July 1, 2017 may receive only 1 
dose of IIV for the 2017–2018 
season.
Vaccination should not be delayed 
to obtain a specific product 
for either dose. Any available, 
age-appropriate trivalent 
or quadrivalent inactivated 
vaccine can be used. A child who 
receives only 1 of the 2 doses 
as a quadrivalent formulation is 
likely to be less primed against the 
additional B virus.
7. Pediatric offices may choose 
to serve as an alternate 
venue for providing influenza 
vaccination for parents 
and other care providers 
of children, if the practice 
is acceptable to both 
pediatricians and the adults 
who are to be vaccinated. 
2 
Medical liability issues and 
medical record documentation 
requirements need to be 
considered before a pediatrician 
begins immunizing adults (see 
details at www. 
aapredbook. 
org/ 
implementation). Pediatricians 
are reminded to document 
the recommendation for adult 
vaccination in the child’s medical 
record. In addition, adults should 
still be encouraged to have a 
medical home and communicate 
their vaccination status to 
their primary care provider. 
Offering adult vaccinations in the 
pediatric practice setting would 
not be intended to undermine 
the adult medical home model, 
but could serve as an additional 
venue for parents and other care 
providers of children to receive 
influenza vaccines. Vaccination 
of close contacts of children at 
high risk of influenza-related 
complications (Table 3) is 
intended to reduce children’s 
risk of exposure to influenza 
(ie, “cocooning”). The practice 
of cocooning also will help 
protect infants younger than 6 
months who are too young to 
be immunized with an influenza 
vaccine. 
8. Pregnant women may receive 
an influenza vaccine at any 
time during pregnancy. 
Pregnant women are of 
special concern because they 
are at an increased risk for 
complications from influenza. 
Any licensed, recommended, 
and age-appropriate trivalent 
or quadrivalent inactivated 
vaccine may be used, including 
recombinant inactivated 
vaccines (RIVs). However, 
experience with the use of RIVs 
in pregnant women 18 years 
and older is limited, because 
RIVs have been available only 
since the 2013–2014 influenza 
season. Substantial data indicate 
that IIV does not cause fetal 
harm when administered to 
a pregnant woman, although 
data on the safety of influenza 
vaccination in the early 
first trimester are limited. 
Assessments of any association 
with influenza vaccination and 
preterm birth and small-for-
gestational-age infants have 
yielded inconsistent results, 
with most studies reporting 
a protective effect or no 
association with these outcomes. 
Vaccination of pregnant women 
also provides protection for 
their infants, potentially for 
as long as 6 months, through 
the transplacental transfer 
of antibodies. For example, 
the authors of 1 recent study 
documented that infants born 
to women reporting influenza 
vaccination during pregnancy 
had risk reductions of 70% 
for laboratory-confirmed 
influenza and 81% for influenza 
hospitalizations in the first 6 
months of life.
9. As soon as the seasonal 
influenza vaccine becomes 
available locally, pediatricians 
or vaccine administrators 
should encourage 
immunization of HCP, notify 
parents and caregivers of 
vaccine availability and

 vaccination, and immunize 
children 6 months and older 
per recommendations, 
especially those at high risk of 
complications from influenza. 
Vaccination should occur by 
the end of October, if possible. 
This is particularly important 
for children who need 2 doses of 
the influenza vaccine to achieve 
optimal protection before the 
circulation of influenza viruses 
in the community. Children 
should receive their first dose 
as soon as possible after a 
vaccine becomes available, to 
allow sufficient time for receipt 
of the second dose ≥4 weeks 
later, preferably by the end of 
October. Provider endorsement 
plays a major role in patient 
acceptance and vaccine uptake. 
Prompt initiation of influenza 
vaccination and continuing 
to vaccinate throughout the 
influenza season, whether 
influenza is circulating (or has 
circulated) in the community, 
are important components of an 
effective vaccination strategy. 
Although there is no evidence 
that waning immunity from early 
administration of the vaccine 
increases the risk of infection in 
children, recent reports raise the 
possibility that early vaccination 
of adults, particularly the 
elderly, might contribute to 
reduced protection later in the 
influenza season. Older adults 
are recognized to have a less 
robust immune response to 
influenza vaccines. A recent 
multiseason analysis from the US 
Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness 
Network found that vaccine 
effectiveness declined by 
∼7% per month for H3N2 and 
influenza B and by 6% to 11% 
per month for H1N1pdm09 in 
individuals 9 years and older. 
Vaccine effectiveness remained 
>0 for at least 5 to 6 months 
after vaccination. Until there are 
definitive data that determine 
if waning immunity influences 
vaccine effectiveness in children, 
the administration of the 
influenza vaccine should not be 
delayed to a later date, because 
this increases the likelihood of 
missing the influenza vaccination 
altogether. Further evaluation 
is needed before any policy 
change in timing is made. An early 
onset of the influenza season is 
another concern about delayed 
vaccination.
10. Providers may continue to 
offer vaccines until June 30 of 
each year, the date marking 
the end of the influenza 
season, because influenza 
is unpredictable. Protective 
immune responses generally 
persist in children throughout 
the influenza season. Although 
peak influenza activity in the 
United States tends to occur 
from January through March, 
influenza activity can occur 
in early fall (October) or late 
spring (end of May) and may 
have more than 1 disease peak. 
This approach also provides 
ample opportunity to administer 
a second dose of the vaccine 
to children 6 months through 
8 years of age when indicated, 
as detailed previously in key 
point 6. This approach also 
allows for optimal ability to 
immunize travelers, particularly 
international travelers, who may 
be exposed to influenza year 
round, depending on destination.
11. HCP, influenza campaign 
organizers, and public health 
agencies are encouraged 
to collaborate to develop 
improved strategies for 
planning, distribution, 
communication, and 
administration of vaccines.
 
• Plan to make the seasonal 
influenza vaccine easily 
accessible for all children. 
Examples include sending 
alerts to families that a vaccine 
is available (eg, e-mails, texts, 
letters, and patient portals); 
creating walk-in influenza 
vaccination clinics; extending 
hours beyond routine times 
during peak vaccination periods; 
administering influenza vaccines 
during both well and sick visits, 
as well as at discharge from 
the hospital; considering how 
to immunize parents, adult 
caregivers, and siblings at the 
same time in the same office 
setting as children2; and working 
with other institutions (eg, 
schools, child care programs, 
local public health departments, 
and religious organizations) 
or alternative care sites, such 
as emergency departments, to 
expand venues for administering 
vaccines. If a child receives an 
influenza vaccine outside of his 
or her medical home, such as at 
a pharmacy, retail-based clinic, 
or another practice, appropriate 
documentation of the vaccination 
should be provided to the patient 
for his or her medical home and 
entered into the state or regional 
immunization information 
system (ie, registry).
 
• Concerted efforts among 
the aforementioned groups, 
plus vaccine manufacturers, 
distributors, and payers, are 
also necessary to prioritize 
distribution appropriately to 
the primary care office setting 
and patient-centered medical 
home before other venues, 
especially when vaccine supplies 
are delayed or limited. Similar 
efforts should be made to 
assuage the vaccine supply 
discrepancy between privately 
insured patients and those 
eligible for vaccination through 
the Vaccines for Children 
program.

• Public health will benefit from 
pediatricians’ discussions about 
vaccine safety, effectiveness, and 
indications. Pediatricians can 
influence vaccine acceptance 
by explaining the importance 
of annual influenza vaccination 
for children, emphasizing when 
a second dose of the vaccine is 
indicated and explaining why 
the intranasal formulation is 
not available. The AAP and CDC 
have created communication 
resources to convey these 
important messages and to help 
the public understand influenza 
recommendations. Resources 
will be available on Red Book 
Online (https://

resources. 
aspx).
 
• The AAP supports mandatory 
influenza vaccination programs 
for all HCP in all settings, 
including outpatient settings. 
HCP should act as role models 
for both their patients and 
colleagues by receiving 
influenza vaccination annually 
and by letting others know 
that they have received the 
vaccine, highlighting the safety 
and effectiveness of annual 
influenza vaccination. Influenza 
vaccination programs for HCP 
benefit the health of employees, 
their patients, and members 
of the community. Mandatory 
influenza immunization for all 
HCP is considered to be ethical, 
just, and necessary to improve 
patient safety.3 Employees of 
health care institutions are asked 
to act in the best interests of 
the health of their patients and 
to honor the requirement of 
causing no harm.
12. Antiviral medications are 
important in the control 
of influenza but are not a 
substitute for influenza 
vaccination. The neuraminidase 
inhibitors (NAIs) oral 
oseltamivir (Tamiflu [Roche 
Laboratories, Nutley, NJ]) and 
inhaled zanamivir (Relenza 
[GlaxoSmithKline, Research 
Triangle Park, NC]) are the 
only antiviral medications 
that are recommended for 
chemoprophylaxis and treatment 
of influenza in children during 
the 2017–2018 season. 
Intravenous peramivir (Rapivab 
[BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, 
Durham, NC]), a third NAI, was 
approved in September 2017 
for use as treatment for acute 
uncomplicated influenza in 
nonhospitalized children 2 years 
and older. Intravenous zanamivir 
remains investigational and 
is not approved in the United 
States. It is not known whether 
intravenous zanamivir will be 
available for compassionate

 use during the 2017–2018 
influenza season. Intravenous 
formulations are especially 
important for those children 
who cannot absorb orally 
or enterically administered 
oseltamivir or tolerate inhaled 
zanamivir. Recent viral 
surveillance and resistance data 
from CDC and the World Health 
Organization (WHO) indicate 
that the majority of currently 
circulating influenza viruses 
likely to cause influenza in North 
America during the 2017–2018 
season continue to be susceptible 
to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and 
peramivir. If a newly emergent 
oseltamivir- or peramivir-
resistant virus is a concern, 
use of intravenous zanamivir 
may be appropriate. Resistance 
characteristics can also change 
for an individual child over the 
duration of a treatment course, 
especially in those who are 
severely immunocompromised 
and may receive extended 
courses because of prolonged 
viral shedding. Up-to-date 
information on current 
recommendations and

SEASONAL INFLUENzA vACCINES
Before the 2013–2014 influenza 
season, only trivalent influenza 
vaccines that included a single 
influenza B strain were available. 
Since the 1980s, 2 antigenically 
distinct lineages (ie, Victoria or 
Yamagata) of influenza B viruses 
have circulated globally. Vaccination 
against 1 B viral lineage generally 
confers little cross-protection 
against the other B viral lineages. 
Thus, trivalent vaccines offer 
limited immunity against circulating 
influenza B strains of the lineage not 
present in the vaccine. Furthermore, 
in recent years, it has proven difficult 
to predict consistently which B 
lineage will predominate during a 
given influenza season. Therefore, a 
quadrivalent vaccine with influenza 
B strains of both lineages would 
be predicted to offer additional 
protection, but there is no evidence 
at this time that a quadrivalent 
vaccine is more effective.
IIvs
For the 2017–2018 season, IIV will 
be available for intramuscular (IM) 
injection in both trivalent (IIV3) and 
quadrivalent (IIV4) formulations. 
IIVs do not contain the live virus. 
The available IIV formulations 
and age groups for which use is 
approved are presented in Table 
4. IIV formulations can be used in 
children with and without chronic 
medical conditions. The most 
common adverse events after IIV3 
administration are local injection site 
pain and tenderness. Fever occurs 
within 24 hours after immunization 
in ∼10% to 35% of children younger 
than 2 years but rarely in older 
children and adults. Mild systemic 
symptoms, such as nausea, lethargy, 
headache, muscle aches, and chills, may 
occur after administration of IIV3.
IM formulations of IIV4 are available 
from several manufacturers with 
specific age indications, including 
brands licensed for use in children 
as young as 6 months. Two licensed 
IIV4 vaccines are available for use in 
children 6 through 35 months of age, 
including one that was approved for 
use in this age group in November 
2016. Of note, as listed in Table 
4, the dose volume for children 6 
through 35 months of age differs 
between these 2 vaccines (0.25 and 
0.5 mL), as does the approved ages 
for which these vaccines may be 
used. Clinical data show comparable 
immunogenicity and reactogenicity 
for these 2 vaccines.
In children, the most common 
injection site adverse reactions 
after administration of IIV were 
pain, redness, and swelling. The 
most common systemic adverse 
events were drowsiness, irritability, 
loss of appetite, fatigue, muscle 
aches, headache, arthralgia, and 
gastrointestinal tract symptoms. These 
events were reported with comparable 
frequency among participants 
receiving the licensed comparator 
IIV3. IIV4 is, therefore, available 
for people 6 months or older when 
otherwise appropriate and may offer 
broader protection against circulating 
influenza B strains than IIV3.
An intradermal (ID) formulation 
of IIV4 is licensed and available for 
use in people 18 through 64 years 
of age. ID vaccine administration 
involves a microinjection with 
a shorter needle than needles 
used for IM administration. The 
most common adverse events are 
redness, induration, swelling, pain, 
and itching, which occur at the 
site of administration. There is no 
preference for IM or ID immunization 
with IIV4 in people 18 through 64 
years of age. Therefore, pediatricians 
may choose to use either the IM or 
ID product for their young adult 
patients and for any adults they are 
vaccinating in their office.
During the 2 influenza seasons 
spanning 2010 to 2012, there were 
increased reports of febrile seizures 
in the United States in young children 
who received IIV3 and 13-valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
(PCV13) concomitantly. Subsequent 
retrospective analyses of past 
seasons have demonstrated a slight 
increase in the risk of febrile seizures 
in children 6 through 23 months 
of age when PCV13 vaccines are 
administered concomitantly with IIV. 
For example, although the authors 
of 1 study found that IIV3 was not 
independently associated with a risk 
of febrile seizures, a small increased 
risk of febrile seizures was noted 
when IIV3 was administered on the

 same day as either pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine or diphtheria-
tetanus-acellular-pertussis (DTaP) 
vaccine. Data on which dose in 
the series was associated with 
the small risk of febrile seizures 
were not documented for either of 
these vaccines. The concomitant 
administration of IIV3, pneumococcal 
conjugate, and DTaP vaccines was 
associated with the greatest relative 
risk estimate, corresponding to 
a maximum additional 30 febrile 
seizure cases per 100 000 children 
vaccinated, compared with the 
administration of the vaccines on 
separate days. In contrast, data 
from the Post-Licensure Rapid 
Immunization Safety Monitoring 
program of the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), the largest 
vaccine safety surveillance program 
in the United States, revealed that 
there was no significant increase 
in febrile seizures associated with 
concomitant administration of 
these 3 vaccines in children 6 to 59 
months of age during the 2010–2011 
season. Although the possibility of 
increased risk for febrile seizures 
cannot be ruled out, simultaneous 
administration of IIV with PCV13 
and/or other vaccines for the 2017–
2018 influenza season continues 
to be recommended when these 
vaccines are indicated. Overall, the 
benefits of timely vaccination with 
same-day administration of IIV and 
PCV13 or DTaP outweigh the risk of 
febrile seizures, which rarely have 
any long-term sequelae.
One trivalent and 2 quadrivalent 
influenza vaccines manufactured 
by using newer technologies will 
be available during the 2017–2018 
season: trivalent and quadrivalent 
recombinant hemagglutinin influenza 
vaccines, available for people 18 
years and older, and cell culture-
based IIVs, available for people 4 
years and older. All of these vaccines 
are administered intramuscularly. 
Trivalent and quadrivalent 
recombinant influenza vaccines are 
recombinant baculovirus-expressed 
hemagglutinin vaccines produced 
in cell cultures. The quadrivalent 
recombinant influenza vaccine 
was licensed for people 18 years 
and older by the FDA in October 
2016. The most frequently reported 
adverse events after administration 
of the 3 vaccines are pain, headache, 
myalgia, and fatigue.
The FDA licensed trivalent, MF59-
adjuvanted, IIV for people 65 years 
and older in November 2015, the 
first adjuvanted influenza vaccine 
marketed in the United States. 
Adjuvants elicit a more robust 
immune response, which could lead 
to a reduction in the number of doses 
required for children. The vaccine is 
currently being studied in children.
 
Table 4 summarizes information on 
the types of IIVs licensed for children 
and adults during the 2017–2018 
season. More than 1 product may 
be appropriate for a given patient. 
Vaccination should not be delayed to 
obtain a specific product.
A large body of scientific evidence 
demonstrates that thimerosal-
containing vaccines are not 
associated with increased risk 
of autism spectrum disorders in 
children. Thimerosal from vaccines 
has not been linked to any medical 
condition. As such, the AAP extends 
its strongest support to the current 
WHO recommendations to retain the 
use of thimerosal as a preservative 
in multiuse vials in the global 
vaccine supply. Some people may 
still raise concerns about the trace 
amount of thimerosal in some IIV 
vaccine formulations (Table 4), and 
in some states, including California, 
Delaware, Illinois, Missouri, New 
York, and Washington, there is a 
legislated restriction on the use of 
thimerosal-containing vaccines. 
The benefits of protecting children 
against the known risks of influenza 
are clear. Therefore, to the extent 
authorized by state law, children 
should receive any available 
formulation of IIV rather than 
delaying vaccination while waiting 
for reduced thimerosal-content or 
thimerosal-free vaccines. Although 
some IIV formulations contain a trace 
amount of it, thimerosal-free IIV 
products can be obtained (Table 4). 
Vaccine manufacturers are delivering 
increasing amounts of thimerosal-
free influenza vaccine each year.
vaccine Effectiveness and LAIv4
The AAP continues to support the 
decision by the CDC to not use LAIV4 
in any setting during the 2017–2018 
influenza season. This interim 
recommendation, originally made 
in 2016, followed observational 
data from the US Influenza Vaccine 
Effectiveness Network revealing 
that LAIV4 performed poorly against 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses 
in recent influenza seasons. There 
has not been additional published 
data during the 2016–2017 season 
to warrant rescinding this interim 
recommendation.
INFLUENzA vACCINES AND EGG 
ALLERGIES
IIV administered in a single, age-
appropriate dose is well tolerated 
by recipients with an egg allergy of 
any severity. Special precautions 
for egg-allergic recipients of IIV are 
not warranted, because the rate of 
anaphylaxis after IIV administration 
is no greater in egg-allergic than in 
non–egg-allergic recipients or from 
other universally recommended 
vaccines. Standard vaccination 
practice for all vaccines in children 
should include the ability to respond 
to rare acute hypersensitivity 
reactions.4 Patients who refuse to 
receive an egg-based vaccine may be 
vaccinated with an age-appropriate 
recombinant or cell-cultured product.

Any of the influenza vaccines can 
be administered at the same visit 
with all other recommended routine 
vaccines.
Im vaccine
IIVs for IM injection are shipped and 
stored at 2°C to 8°C (36°F–46°F); 
frozen vaccines should not be used. 
These split or subunit vaccines are 
administered intramuscularly into 
the anterolateral thigh of infants 
and young children and into the 
deltoid muscle of older children and 
adults. Most have variable immune 
responses in young children. A new 
vaccine option available for infants 
and toddlers 6 months through 35 
months of age can be administered 
as 0.5-mL doses for all age groups, 
a delivery of twice the amount of 
antigen previously indicated for 
children 6 through 35 months of 
age. For this new vaccine, clinical 
data reveal immunogenicity and 
reactogenicity comparable to that 
for the vaccine used in this age 
group in recent seasons, which was 
administered as 0.25 mL per dose 
(Table 4). Although the amount of 
antigen differs, the number of doses 
required with either vaccine for 
this age group is the same. A 0.5-mL 
unit dose of any IIV should not be 
split into 2 separate 0.25-mL doses 
because of safety concerns for lack of 
sterility, variance with the package 
insert, and potential compliance 
difficulties with vaccine excise taxes.
ID vaccine
IIVs for ID injection are shipped 
and stored at 2°C to 8°C (36–46°F). 
These vaccines are administered 
intradermally only to people 18 
through 64 years of age, preferably 
over the deltoid muscle, and only by 
using the device included in the vaccine 
package. The vaccine is supplied in a 
single-dose, prefilled microinjection 
system (0.1 mL) for adults. The 
package insert contains the full 
administration details of this product.
CURRENT RECOmmENDATIONS
Seasonal influenza vaccination with 
IIV is recommended for all children 6 
months and older. LAIV4 should not 
be used. Children and adolescents 
with certain underlying medical 
conditions, listed below, have an 
elevated risk of complications from 
influenza:
 
• asthma or other chronic pulmonary 
diseases, including cystic fibrosis;
 
• hemodynamically significant 
cardiac disease;
 
• immunosuppressive disorders or 
therapy;
 
• HIV infection;
 
• sickle cell anemia and other 
hemoglobinopathies;
 
• diseases that necessitate long-
term aspirin therapy or salicylate-
containing medication, including 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
or Kawasaki disease, that may 
place a child at increased risk of 
Reye syndrome if infected with 
influenza;
 
• chronic renal dysfunction;
 
• chronic metabolic disease, 
including diabetes mellitus;
 
• any condition that can compromise 
respiratory function or handling 
of secretions or can increase 
the risk of aspiration, such as 
neurodevelopmental disorders, 
spinal cord injuries, seizure 
disorders, or neuromuscular 
abnormalities; and
 
• pregnancy.
Additional vaccination efforts should 
be made for the following groups to 
prevent transmission of influenza to 
those at risk, unless contraindicated:
 
• Household contacts and out-of-
home care providers of children 
younger than 5 years and of at-risk 
children of all ages;
 
• Any woman who is pregnant 
or considering pregnancy, is 
in the postpartum period, or is 
breastfeeding during the influenza 
season. It is safe to administer 
the influenza vaccine to pregnant 
women during any trimester. 
Any licensed, recommended, 
and age-appropriate trivalent or 
quadrivalent IIV or RIV may be 
used, although experience with the 
use of RIVs in pregnant women is 
limited. Studies have revealed that 
infants born to immunized women 
have better influenza-related 
health outcomes than infants of 
unimmunized women. However, 
according to Internet-based panel 
surveys conducted by the CDC, 
only ∼50% of pregnant women 
during the 2015–2016 influenza 
season and 47% of women during 
the 2016–2017 season (according 
to preliminary data) reported 
receiving an influenza vaccine, 
even though both pregnant women 
and their newborn infants are at 
higher risk of complications. More 
data on the safety of influenza 
vaccination in the early first 
trimester are becoming available. 
In a 5-year retrospective cohort 
study from 2003 to 2008, which 
included more than 10 000 women, 
influenza vaccination in the first 
trimester was not associated 
with an increase in the rates of 
major congenital malformations. 
Similarly, a systematic review 
and meta-analysis of studies 
of congenital anomalies after 
vaccination during pregnancy, 
including data from 15 studies 
(14 cohort studies and 1 case-
control study) did not reveal any 
association between congenital 
defects and influenza vaccination 
in any trimester, including the first 
trimester’s gestation. Assessments 
of any association with influenza

 vaccination and preterm birth and 
small-for-gestational-age infants 
have revealed inconsistent results, 
with the authors of most studies 
reporting a protective effect or no 
association against these outcomes. 
Breastfeeding is also recommended 
to protect against influenza viruses 
by activating innate antiviral 
mechanisms, specifically type 1 
interferons. In addition, human 
milk from mothers vaccinated 
during the third trimester contains 
higher levels of influenza-specific 
immunoglobulin A. Greater

htm;
 
• American Indian/Alaskan native 
children and adolescents;
 
• HCP or health care volunteers. 
Despite the AAP recommendation 
for mandatory influenza 
immunization for all HCP, 
3 many 
remain unvaccinated. With an 
increasing number of organizations 
mandating influenza vaccination, 
coverage among HCP increased 
to 79% in the 2015–2016 season. 
Early-season 2016–2017 vaccine 
coverage among HCP was 68.5%, 
similar to early-season coverage 
during the 2015–2016 season. 
Optimal prevention of influenza 
in the health care setting depends 
on the vaccination of at least 
90% of HCP, which is consistent 
with the national Healthy People 
2020 target for annual influenza 
vaccination among HCP. However, 
overall vaccination rates for 
this group remain consistently 
below this goal. The AAP recently 
reaffirmed its support for a 
mandatory influenza vaccination 
policy for all HCP nationwide, 
including in outpatient settings.2 
Mandating the influenza vaccine 
for all HCP is ethical, just, and 
necessary to improve patient 
safety, especially because HCP 
frequently come into contact with 
patients at a high risk of influenza 
illness in their clinical settings. 
For the prevention and control of 
influenza, all HCP must continue to 
prioritize the health and safety of 
patients; and
 
• Close contacts of 
immunosuppressed people.
CONTRAINDICATIONS AND 
PRECAUTIONS
Minor illnesses, with or without fever, 
are not contraindications to the use of 
influenza vaccines, particularly among 
children with mild upper respiratory 
infection symptoms or allergic rhinitis. 
Children diagnosed with a moderate 
to severe febrile illness, on the basis 
of the judgment of the clinician, 
should not be vaccinated with IIV 
until resolution of the illness. Infants 
younger than 6 months should also 
not be vaccinated with IIV. A previous 
severe allergic reaction to an influenza 
vaccine (ie, anaphylaxis involving 
cardiovascular changes, respiratory 
or gastrointestinal tract symptoms, 
or reactions that necessitate the 
use of epinephrine), regardless of 
the component suspected of being 
responsible for the reaction, is a 
contraindication to future receipt of 
the vaccine.
The estimated risk for Guillain-Barré 
syndrome (GBS) is low, especially in 
children. Although influenza infection 
is recognized to be a cause of GBS, 
there is no elevated risk of GBS from 
influenza vaccination. As a precaution, 
people who are not at high risk for 
severe influenza and who are known to 
have experienced GBS within 6 weeks 
of influenza vaccination generally 
should not be vaccinated. However, 
the benefits of influenza vaccination 
might outweigh the risks for certain 
people who have a history of GBS and 
who also are at high risk for severe 
complications from influenza.

USE OF ANTIvIRAL mEDICATIONS
Oral oseltamivir remains the antiviral 
drug of choice for the management 
of influenza infections. Although 
more difficult to administer, inhaled 
zanamivir is an equally acceptable 
alternative for patients who do not 
have chronic respiratory disease. 
Intravenous peramivir, a third 
NAI, is available for children who 
cannot absorb orally or enterically 
administered oseltamivir or tolerate 
inhaled zanamivir. Intravenous

a Oseltamivir is administered orally without regard to meals, although administration with meals may improve gastrointestinal tolerability. Oseltamivir is available as Tamiflu in 30-, 45-, and 75-mg 
capsules and as a powder for oral suspension that is reconstituted to provide a final concentration of 6 mg/mL. For the 6-mg/mL suspension, a 30-mg dose is given with 5 mL of oral suspension, a 
45-mg dose is given with 7.5 mL of oral suspension; a 60-mg dose is given with 10 mL of oral suspension, and a 75-mg dose is given with 12.5 mL of oral suspension. If the commercially manufactured 
oral suspension is not available, a suspension can be compounded by retail pharmacies (the final concentration is also 6 mg/mL), on the basis of instructions contained in the package label. In 
patients with renal insufficiency, the dose should be adjusted on the basis of creatinine clearance. For treatment of patients with a creatinine clearance of 10–30 mL/min, the following dosage 
should be provided: 75 mg, once daily, for 5 d. For chemoprophylaxis of patients with a creatinine clearance of 10–30 mL/min, the following dosage should be provided: 30 mg, once daily, for 10 d 
after exposure or 75 mg, once every other day, for 10 d after exposure (5 doses). See www.

b Approved by the FDA for children as young as 2 wk of age. Given preliminary pharmacokinetic data and limited safety data, oseltamivir can be used to treat influenza in both term and 
preterm infants from birth because benefits of therapy are likely to outweigh possible risks of treatment.
c Oseltamivir dosing recommendations for preterm infants are as follows. The weight-based dosing recommendation for preterm infants is lower than for term infants. Preterm infants may 
have lower clearance of oseltamivir because of immature renal function, and doses recommended for term infants may lead to high drug concentrations in this age group. Limited data from 
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group provides the basis for dosing preterm infants by using their postmenstrual age (gestational age + 
chronological age): 1.0 mg/kg per dose, orally, twice daily, for those <38 wk postmenstrual age; 1.5 mg/kg per dose, orally, twice daily, for those 38 through 40 wk postmenstrual age; 3.0 mg/
kg per dose, orally, twice daily, for those >40 wk postmenstrual age. For extremely preterm infants (<28 wk), please consult a pediatric infectious diseases physician.
d Zanamivir is administered by inhalation by using a proprietary “Diskhaler” device distributed together with the medication. Zanamivir is a dry powder, not an aerosol, and should not 
be administered by using nebulizers, ventilators, or other devices typically used for administering medications in aerosolized solutions. Zanamivir is not recommended for people with 
chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which increase the risk of bronchospasm.
e Peramivir is administered via intravenous infusion for 15 to 30 minutes. It is available as a clear, colorless solution in single-use vials containing 200 mg peramivir in 20 mL of sodium 
chloride solution. In patients with renal insufficiency, the dose should be adjusted on the basis of creatinine clearance. For treatment of adult or adolescent patients (≥13 years) with 
creatinine clearance 10–29 mL/min: 100 mg, with creatinine clearance 30–49 mL/min: 200 mg. For treatment of pediatric patients (2 through 12 years) with creatinine clearance 10–29 
mL/min: 2 mg/kg (up to 600 mg), with creatinine clearance 30--49 mL/min: 4 mg/kg (up to 600 mg). See https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/206426s004lbl.pdf.

 zanamivir remains investigational 
and is not approved in the United 
States. It is not known whether 
either intravenous zanamivir will 
be available for compassionate use 
during the 2017–2018 influenza 
season. A prospective, open-
label pediatric clinical trial has 
been conducted to investigate 
pharmacokinetics and the clinical/
virologic response to treatment with 
intravenous zanamivir for children 
6 months or older who have a 
serious influenza infection and could 
not tolerate oral or inhaled NAIs. 
Although intravenous zanamivir 
has previously been available for 
compassionate use for seriously ill 
children, with the support of the 
FDA through the manufacturer, 
GlaxoSmithKline, it is not known 
whether it will be available for 
compassionate use during the 2017–
2018 influenza season.
Antiviral resistance to any drug can 
emerge, necessitating continuous 
population-based assessment that 
is conducted by the CDC. If local 
or national influenza surveillance 
data indicate the emergence of 
an influenza strain with a known 
antiviral resistance profile, then, 
according to the CDC, empirical 
treatment can be directed toward 
that strain with an effective antiviral 
agent. During the 2016–2017 
season, the vast majority of the 
tested influenza strains were 
susceptible to oseltamivir, zanamivir, 
and peramivir. In contrast, high 
levels of resistance to amantadine 
and rimantadine persist among 
the influenza A viruses currently 
circulating, and adamantanes are 
not effective against influenza B 
viruses, so these drugs should not 
be used in the upcoming season 
unless resistance patterns change 
significantly. Therefore, it is 
important to note the following:
 
• Current treatment guidelines for 
antiviral medications (Table 5) 
are unchanged for the 2017–2018 
season and are applicable to both 
infants and children with suspected 
influenza when strains are known to 
be circulating in the community or 
when infants or children are tested 
and confirmed to have influenza; 
 
• Oseltamivir is available in 
capsule and oral suspension 
formulations. The commercially 
manufactured liquid formulation 
has a concentration of 6 mg/mL. 
If the commercially manufactured 
oral suspension is not available, 
the capsule may be opened and the 
contents mixed with simple syrup or 
Ora-Sweet SF (sugar-free) by retail 
pharmacies to a final concentration 
of 6 mg/mL (Table 6); and 
 
• Continuous monitoring of the 
epidemiology, change in severity, 
and resistance patterns of 
influenza strains may lead to new 
guidance.
Regardless of influenza vaccination 
status and whether the onset of 
illness has been <48 hours, treatment 
should be offered as early as possible 
without waiting for confirmatory 
influenza testing for the following 
individuals (Table 5):
 
• any hospitalized child clinically 
presumed to have influenza disease 
or with severe, complicated, or 
progressive illness attributable to 
influenza; and
 
• influenza infection of any 
severity in children at high risk 
of complications of influenza 
infection (Table 3).
Treatment should be considered for 
the following individuals (Table 5):
 
• Any otherwise healthy child 
clinically presumed to have 
influenza disease. The greatest 
effect on outcome will occur if 
treatment can be initiated within 
48 hours of illness onset but still 
should be considered if later in the 
course of progressive, symptomatic 
illness; and
 
• Children clinically presumed to 
have influenza disease and whose 
siblings or household contacts 
either are younger than 6 months 
or have underlying medical 
conditions that predispose them to 
complications of influenza.
Reviewers of available studies by 
the CDC, the WHO, and independent 
investigators have consistently found 
that timely oseltamivir treatment 
can reduce the duration of fever 
and illness symptoms and the risks 
of complications, including those 
resulting in hospitalization and death. 
A 2014 Cochrane meta-analysis of 
randomized, placebo-controlled 
trials of oseltamivir or zanamivir 
overwhelmingly performed in 
outpatient adults and children with 
confirmed or suspected exposure 
to naturally occurring influenza 
revealed that the question of whether 
the complications of influenza are 
reduced by NAIs is not settled, so 
the balance between benefits and 
harms should be considered when 
making decisions about use of NAIs 
for either treatment or prophylaxis of 
influenza. Unfortunately, treatment 
efficacy has not yet been adequately 
evaluated among hospitalized 
children or children with comorbid 
conditions in randomized trials. 
Although limited prospective 
comparative data exist to date, 
multiple retrospective observational 
studies and meta-analyses have 
been conducted to determine the 
role of NAIs in treating severe 
influenza. Most experts support the 
use of NAIs to reduce complications 
and hospitalizations, although less 
agreement exists on the use of NAIs 
in low-risk populations in whom the 
benefits are likely modest.
Importantly, treatment with 
oseltamivir for children with serious, 
complicated, or progressive disease 
presumptively or definitively caused 
by influenza, irrespective of influenza 
vaccination status or whether illness 
began >48 hours before admission,

 continues to be recommended by the 
AAP, CDC, and Infectious Diseases 
Society of America/Pediatric 
Infectious Diseases Society. Earlier 
treatment provides better clinical 
responses. However, treatment after 
48 hours of symptoms in adults and 
children with moderate to severe 
disease or with progressive disease 
has been shown to provide some 
benefit and should be strongly 
considered. No benefit exists for 
double-dose NAI therapy, compared 
with standard-dose therapy, a 
conclusion based on published data 
from a randomized, prospective 
trial with 75% of its subjects of ages 
younger than 15 years.
Dosages of antiviral agents for both 
treatment and chemoprophylaxis 
in children can be found in Table 6 
(doses for all ages, including doses 
for preterm infants that have not 
been evaluated by the FDA) and 
on the CDC Web site (www.

htm). Children younger than 
2 years are at an increased risk of 
hospitalization and complications 
attributable to influenza. The 
FDA has licensed oseltamivir for 
children as young as 2 weeks. Given 
preliminary pharmacokinetic data 
and limited safety data, the AAP 
believes that oseltamivir can be used 
to treat influenza in both term and 
preterm infants from birth, because 
the benefits of therapy are likely to 
outweigh possible risks of treatment.
In adverse event data collected 
systematically in prospective trials, 
vomiting was the only adverse effect 
seen more often with oseltamivir 
than with placebo when studied 
in children 1 through 12 years of 
age (ie, 15% of treated children 
versus 9% receiving placebo). 
In addition, after reports from 
Japan of oseltamivir-attributable 
neuropsychiatric adverse effects, a 
review of controlled clinical trial data 
and ongoing surveillance has failed 
to establish a link between this drug 
and neurologic or psychiatric events.

Clinical judgment (on the basis 
of underlying conditions, disease 
severity, time since symptom onset, 
and local influenza activity) is 
an important factor in treatment 
decisions for pediatric patients 
who present with influenza-like 
illness. Antiviral treatment should 
be started as soon as possible 
after illness onset and should 
not be delayed while waiting for 
a definitive influenza test result, 
because early therapy provides the 
best outcomes. Influenza diagnostic 
tests vary by method, availability, 
processing time, sensitivity, and 
cost (Table 7), all of which should 
be considered in making the best 
clinical judgment. Influenza test 
results are influenced by the level of 
influenza activity in the population 
being tested, the characteristics of a 
test compared with a gold standard, 
pretest probability, whether the 
influenza virus is actively replicating 
in the person, proper collection and 
transport of specimens, and proper 
test procedures. Testing should be 
performed when timely results will 
be available to influence clinical 
management or infection control 
measures. Although decisions on 
treatment and infection control can 
be made on the basis of positive 
rapid antigen test results, negative 
results should not always be used 
in a similar fashion because of the 
suboptimal sensitivity and the 
potential for false-negative results. 
Positive results of rapid influenza 
tests are helpful because they may 
reduce additional testing to identify 
the cause of the child’s influenza-
like illness and promote appropriate 
antimicrobial stewardship. Available 
FDA-approved rapid molecular 
assays are highly sensitive, and 
specific diagnostic tests are 
performed in <20 minutes by using 
RNA detection. These molecular 
assays or polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) test confirmation are 
preferred in hospitalized patients 
because they are more sensitive 
than antigen detection. Presumptive 
antiviral treatment in high-risk and 
hospitalized patients should be 
started before receiving rapid test, 
molecular assay, or PCR results.

 Immunofluorescence assays may 
be an alternative to PCR testing, 
although the sensitivity is lower. 
Early detection, prompt antiviral 
treatment, and infection control 
interventions can lead to improved 
individual patient outcomes and 
allow for effective cohorting and 
disease containment.
People with suspected influenza 
who present with an uncomplicated 
febrile illness should be offered 
treatment with antiviral medications 
if they are at a higher risk of 
influenza complications (Table 3). 
Any otherwise healthy children 
who have a similar uncomplicated 
presentation should be considered 
for antiviral medication, particularly 
if they are in contact with other 
children who either are younger 
than 6 months or have underlying 
medical conditions that predispose 
them to complications of influenza. 
If there is a local shortage of 
antiviral medications, local public 
health authorities should provide 
additional guidance about testing 
and treatment. In past years, local 
shortages of oseltamivir suspension 
have occurred because of uneven 
drug distribution, although national 
shortages have not occurred 
since 2009, particularly given the 
availability of the capsule formulation 
that can be made into a suspension 
for young children (Table 6).
Randomized placebo-controlled 
studies revealed that oral 
oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir 
were efficacious when administered 
as chemoprophylaxis to household 
contacts after a family member had 
laboratory-confirmed influenza. 
During the 2009 pandemic, the 
emergence of oseltamivir resistance 
was noted among people receiving 
postexposure prophylaxis, 
highlighting the need to be aware 
of the possibility of emerging 
resistance in this population. 
Decisions on whether to administer 
antiviral chemoprophylaxis 
should take into account the 
exposed person’s risk of influenza 
complications, vaccination status, 
the type and duration of contact, 
recommendations from local or 
public health authorities, and clinical 
judgment. Optimally, postexposure 
chemoprophylaxis should only be 
used when antiviral agents can be 
started within 48 hours of exposure; 
the lower dose for prophylaxis 
should not be used for treatment 
of children symptomatic with 
influenza. Early, full treatment doses 
(rather than prophylaxis doses) 
provided to high-risk symptomatic 
patients without waiting for 
laboratory confirmation is an 
alternate strategy.
Although vaccination is the preferred 
approach to prevention of infection, 
chemoprophylaxis during an 
influenza outbreak, as defined by 
the CDC (http:// 
www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
ophss/ 
csels/ 
dsepd/ 
ss1978/ 
lesson1/ 
section11. 
html), is recommended in 
the following situations:
 
• for children at high risk of 
complications from influenza for 
whom the influenza vaccine is 
contraindicated;
 
• for children at high risk during 
the 2 weeks after influenza 
vaccination, before optimal 
immunity is achieved;
 
• for family members or HCP who 
are unimmunized and are likely to 
have ongoing, close exposure to the 
following:
 
• unimmunized children at high  
risk; or
 
• unimmunized infants and toddlers 
who are younger than 24 months;
 
• for control of influenza outbreaks 
for unimmunized staff and children 
in a closed institutional setting 
with children at high risk (eg, 
extended-care facilities);
 
• as a supplement to vaccination 
among children at high risk, 
including children who are 
immunocompromised and may 
not respond with sufficient 
protective immune responses after 
vaccination;
 
• as postexposure prophylaxis 
for family members and close 
contacts of an infected person if 
those people are at high risk of 
complications from influenza; and
 
• for children at high risk of 
complications and their family 
members and close contacts, as 
well as HCP, when circulating 
strains of influenza virus in the 
community are not matched 
with seasonal influenza vaccine 
strains, on the basis of current 
data from the CDC and local health 
departments.
These recommendations apply 
to routine circumstances, but it 
should be noted that guidance may 
change on the basis of updated 
recommendations from the CDC in 
concert with antiviral availability, 
local resources, clinical judgment, 
recommendations from local or 
public health authorities, risk of 
influenza complications, type and 
duration of exposure contact, and 
change in epidemiology or severity 
of influenza. Chemoprophylaxis 
is not recommended for infants 
younger than 3 months unless the 
situation is judged critical because 
of limited safety and efficacy data in 
this age group.
The influenza vaccine should 
always be offered before and 
within the influenza season when 
not contraindicated, even after the 
influenza virus has been circulating in 
the community. Antiviral medications 
currently licensed are important 
adjuncts to influenza vaccination 
for control and prevention of 
influenza disease. Toxicities are 
associated with antiviral agents, 
and indiscriminate use might 
limit availability. Pediatricians 
should inform recipients of 
antiviral chemoprophylaxis that 
risk of influenza is lowered but

medication, and susceptibility to 
influenza returns when medication 
is discontinued. Oseltamivir use is 
not a contraindication to vaccination 
with IIV. For recommendations about 
treatment and chemoprophylaxis 
against influenza, see Table 6.

both vaccination and antiviral 
chemoprophylaxis may be

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
For the 2017–2018 season, 
postmarketing safety and real-
time vaccine effectiveness data 
will be analyzed as they become 
available. Continued evaluation of 
the safety, immunogenicity, and 
effectiveness of influenza vaccines, 
especially for young children and 
pregnant women, is important. 
The potential role of previous 
influenza vaccination on overall 
vaccine effectiveness by vaccine 
formulation, virus strain, and 
subject age in preventing outpatient 
medical visits, hospitalizations, and 
deaths continues to be evaluated. 
Furthermore, complete analysis of 
quadrivalent vaccines is needed 
as the number of formulations 
of IIV4 increase. Additionally, 
with limited data on the use of 
NAIs in hospitalized children 
or in children with comorbid 
conditions, prospective randomized 
clinical trials in this population 
are warranted. The interim 
recommendation that LAIV4 should 
not be used in children continues to 
be reevaluated.
Immunizing all HCP, a crucial 
step in efforts to reduce health 
care–associated influenza 
infections, serves as an example 
to patients, highlighting the 
safety and effectiveness of annual 
vaccination. Ongoing efforts should 
include broader implementation 
and evaluation of mandatory 
vaccination programs in both 
inpatient and outpatient settings. 
Further investigation into the 
extent of offering to immunize 
parents and adult child care 
providers in the pediatric office 
setting; the level of family contact 
satisfaction with this practice; 
how practices handle the logistic, 
liability, legal, and financial barriers 
that limit or complicate this service; 
and most importantly, how this 
practice will affect disease rates 
in children and adults is needed. 
There is also a need for more 
systematic health services research 
on influenza vaccine uptake and 
refusal as well as identification of 
methods to enhance uptake.5 In 
2017, only 3 states (ie, CA, MS, and 
WV) restrict vaccine exemption 
laws to medical exemptions.6 
However, influenza vaccination is 
not typically required for school 
entry.
Efforts should be made to 
create adequate outreach and 
infrastructure to facilitate the 
optimal distribution of the vaccine 
so that more people are immunized. 
Pediatricians also might consider 
becoming more involved in 
pandemic preparedness and disaster 
planning efforts. A bidirectional 
partner dialogue between 
pediatricians and public health 
decision-makers assists efforts to 
address children’s issues during 
the initial state, regional, and local 
plan development stages. Pandemic 
influenza preparedness of directors 
of child care centers also needs to 
improve. Additional information can 
be found at www. 
aap. 
org/ 
disasters/ 
resourcekit.
Pandemic influenza preparedness 
is of particular interest because 
of the increase in the number of 
human infections with Asian H7N9 
reported in China. A few human 
infections of Asian H7N9 have  
been reported outside of mainland 
China, but most of these infections 
have occurred among people 
who had traveled to China before 
becoming ill. These Asian H7N9 
viruses have not been detected 
in people or birds in the United 
States. Although the current risk 
to the public’s health from this 
virus is low, Asian H7N9 virus is 
among the nonhuman influenza 
viruses that are most concerning 
to public health officials because 
of their pandemic potential and 
ability to cause severe disease in 
infected humans. The current risk 
to the public’s health from the virus 
remains low; however, the CDC is 
monitoring the situation carefully 
and taking routine preparedness 
measures, including making a 
candidate vaccine.
With the increased demand for 
vaccination during each influenza 
season, the AAP and the CDC 
recommend vaccine administration 
at any visit to the medical home 
during influenza season when it is 
not contraindicated, at specially 
arranged vaccine-only sessions, 
and through cooperation with 
community sites, schools, and 
child care centers to provide the 
influenza vaccine. If alternate 
venues, including pharmacies 
and other retail-based clinics, are 
used for vaccination, a system of 
patient record transfer is beneficial 
in maintaining the accuracy of 
immunization records. Immunization 
information systems should be used 
whenever available and prioritized 
to document influenza vaccination. 
Two-dimensional barcodes have 
been used to facilitate more efficient 
and accurate documentation of 
vaccine administration with limited 
experience to date. Additional 
information concerning current 
vaccines shipped with 2-dimensional 
barcodes can be found at www.

Downloaded from 
 records, and questions regarding 
who can provide consent may be 
addressed by linking children (eg, 
those in foster care or refugee, 
immigrant, or homeless children) 
with a medical home, by using all 
health care encounters as vaccination 
opportunities, and by more 
consistently using immunization 
registry data. Innovative strategies 
of capturing those who usually 
prefer the intranasal formulation 
would be valuable, given the recent 
recommendations to not use LAIV4. 
One new strategy of interest is 
IIV delivered by a dissolvable 
microneedle patch, which has 
the potential to improve vaccine 
acceptability, coverage and reduce 
costs. Data from the first phase-1 
human clinical trial (n = 100) 
found that the microneedle patch 
immunization was well tolerated 
and generated robust antibody 
responses.
Development efforts continue 
for a universal influenza vaccine 
that induces broader protection 
and eliminates the need for 
annual vaccination. In addition, 
development of a safe, immunogenic 
vaccine for infants younger than 6 
months is essential. Studies on the 
effectiveness and safety of influenza 
vaccines containing adjuvants 
that enhance immune responses 
to influenza vaccines are ongoing. 
Finally, efforts to improve the 
vaccine development process to 
allow for a shorter interval between 
identification of vaccine strains 
and vaccine production continue. 
Pediatricians can remain informed 
during the influenza season by 
following the AAP Red Book Online 
Influenza Resource Page (www. 
aapredbook.
