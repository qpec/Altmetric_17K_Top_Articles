Background: High-sensitivity assays for cardiac troponin T (hs-
cTnT) are sometimes used to rapidly rule out acute myocardial
infarction (AMI).
Purpose: To estimate the ability of a single hs-cTnT concentra-
tion below the limit of detection (<0.005 μg/L) and a nonisch-
emic electrocardiogram (ECG) to rule out AMI in adults present-
ing to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain.
Data Sources: EMBASE and MEDLINE without language restric-
tions (1 January 2008 to 14 December 2016).
Study Selection: Cohort studies involving adults presenting to
the ED with possible acute coronary syndrome in whom an ECG
and hs-cTnT measurements were obtained and AMI outcomes
adjudicated during initial hospitalization.
Data Extraction: Investigators of studies provided data on the
number of low-risk patients (no new ischemia on ECG and hs-
cTnT measurements <0.005 μg/L) and the number who had AMI
during hospitalization (primary outcome) or a major adverse car-
diac event (MACE) or death within 30 days (secondary out-
comes), by risk classification (low or not low risk). Two indepen-
dent epidemiologists rated risk of bias of studies.
Data Synthesis: Of 9241 patients in 11 cohort studies, 2825
(30.6%) were classified as low risk. Fourteen (0.5%) low-risk pa-
tients had AMI. Sensitivity of the risk classification for AMI ranged
from 87.5% to 100% in individual studies. Pooled estimated sen-
sitivity was 98.7% (95% CI, 96.6% to 99.5%). Sensitivity for 30-day
MACEs ranged from 87.9% to 100%; pooled sensitivity was
98.0% (CI, 94.7% to 99.3%). No low-risk patients died.
Limitation: Few studies, variation in timing and methods of ref-
erence standard troponin tests, and heterogeneity of risk and
prevalence of AMI across studies.
Conclusion: A single hs-cTnT concentration below the limit of
detection in combination with a nonischemic ECG may success-
fully rule out AMI in patients presenting to EDs with possible
emergency acute coronary syndrome.

O
nly 10% to 20% of patients who present to emer-
gency departments (EDs) with suspected cardiac-
related chest pain are diagnosed with acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) (1–3). Researchers have developed
rule-out strategies to identify patients with non-AMI
chest pain for safe, early discharge to outpatient man-
agement (1–3). A high-sensitivity assay for cardiac tro-
ponin T (hs-cTnT) enables more reliable detection of
very low concentrations of troponin T. A single hs-cTnT
measurement below the limit of detection (LoD) or the
limit of blank (LoB) may rule out AMI (4, 5).
Although these cutoffs have appeared as part of
diagnostic pathways in European guidelines (6, 7), the
underpinning evidence presented was from a small
number of studies, some of which were affected by lab-
oratory calibration errors resulting in hs-cTnT concen-
trations that were lower than the true concentrations,
including the largest study to advocate this approach to
date (8, 9). In that retrospective analysis of 14 636 pa-
tients with chest pain, 61% had an initial hs-cTnT mea-
surement less than 0.005 μg/L (the LoD) and no isch-
emic
ST-segment
changes
on
electrocardiography
(ECG). Of these, 0.2% had AMI within 30 days of their
presentation at the ED. However, the retrospective de-
sign of this large study included several methodologi-
cal compromises (9). Two meta-analyses considered a
single hs-cTnT measurement below the LoD to rule out
AMI; however, one combined results from 2 thresholds
(0.003 and 0.005 μg/L) (10), and the other combined

 studies of hs-cTnT with studies of high-sensitivity car-
diac troponin I measurements below the LoD (11). Both
of these approaches are flawed and preclude use of
the resultant pooled statistics to evaluate a rule-out
strategy that uses hs-cTnT measurements below the
LoD; therefore, advocacy for such a strategy is prema-
ture. However, if findings can be validated across mul-
tiple studies that are free of these limitations, this ap-
proach could enable safe discharge of many more
patients than in current practice.
Our objective was to test the utility of a single hs-
cTnT measurement below the LoD combined with an
ECG without evidence of acute ischemia to safely identify
patients at low risk for AMI on presentation to the ED.
METHODS
We developed and followed a protocol (Supple-
ment 1, available at Annals.org) and report findings ac-
cording to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines (12).
Data Sources and Searches
We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE without lan-
guage restrictions from 1 January 2008 (when the hs-
cTnT assay was released) to 14 December 2016 using
the terms chest pain, chest discomfort, acute coronary
syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, troponin, high
sensitive/sensitivity, and emergency room/department
(Table 1 of Supplement 2, available at Annals.org).
Study Selection
Two reviewers (J.W.P. and J.Y.) independently
screened titles and abstracts, including conference ab-
stracts, and identified potential cohorts from the full-
text articles. When only conference abstracts were
available, a further manual search was conducted
based on author names for full-text articles. A third re-
viewer (M.P.T.) confirmed exclusion or inclusion of co-
horts. Principal investigators and lead authors for each
eligible cohort were contacted. We excluded cohorts if
the investigators were unable to provide data.
Eligible studies were prospective studies that were
published in peer-reviewed journals, recruited patients
evaluated in the ED for possible acute coronary syn-
drome with an ECG and hs-cTnT measurement, and re-
ported on our primary end point. We excluded studies
that did not prospectively collect data; adjudicate for
AMI using the universal definition (Supplement 1); or
address the calibration error of hs-cTnT assay batch
numbers 157120, 160197, and 163704 (produced be-
tween October 2009 and April 2012, with the latest
expiration date of October 2012) by confirming that
no samples from affected batches were included in
the original study, excluding samples from affected
batches, or assigning new values of the calibrator set
applied to the original analyzer results (thereby provid-
ing exact and correct results).
Data Synthesis and Analysis
The primary end point was index admission AMI
according to the Global Task Force definition, which
requires biochemical evidence of myocardial necrosis
and clinical evidence of myocardial ischemia (ischemic
symptoms, ECG changes, or imaging evidence) (13).
Patients with ST-segment elevation MI on the initial
ECG were excluded from our analysis. There was no
restriction on the troponin assay used for adjudication
of AMI. We evaluated 2 secondary end points: death or
occurrence of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE),
both within 30 days after first presentation (including
during the initial hospitalization). Major adverse cardiac
events included death, cardiac arrest, emergency re-
vascularization procedure, cardiogenic shock, ventricu-
lar arrhythmia or high-degree atrioventricular block re-
quiring intervention, and AMI (14).
The index test was ECG and hs-cTnT measurement
at ED presentation. Patients with a negative test result,
defined as no new ischemic changes on the ECG (ST-
segment changes or T-wave inversion indicative of car-
diac ischemia) and hs-cTnT concentrations below the
LoD (<0.005 μg/L) of the Roche Diagnostics hs-cTnT
assay (sometimes called the fifth-generation troponin T
assay [Table 2 of Supplement 2]) were classified as hav-
ing low risk for AMI and subsequent adverse events.
The secondary index test used the LoB (0.003 μg/L)
instead of the LoD.
We calculated the proportion of patients in each
study classified as being at low risk for AMI using the
index test. We validated the clinical performance of the
index test by calculating the sensitivity (1 � false-
negative rate) of non–low-risk classification for AMI dur-
ing the initial hospitalization. The chi-square test for
equality of sensitivities (null hypothesis) was applied.
We also report the negative predictive value (NPV) be-
cause this has been used to assess performance in
many troponin biomarker studies, but because this is
prevalence-dependent, we chose to use sensitivity for
the primary analysis. For completeness, we also report
test specificity and the positive predictive value (PPV),
although we note that it is not currently intended that
patients should be stratified as high-risk (ruled in) using
the proposed strategy.
For the secondary analysis, we assessed the clinical
performance of the index test for prediction of MACEs
within 30 days of presentation by calculating the test
sensitivity, NPV, specificity, and PPV. Additional ana-
lyses were conducted using the LoB as the diagnostic
threshold for hs-cTnT. We used a random-effects bivari-
ate model (15) to obtain the summary estimates of sen-
sitivity (principal summary measure), specificity, NPV,
and PPV and their 95% CIs, which reflect the degree of
heterogeneity among studies. A summary receiver-
operating characteristic curve was used to show the
discriminative ability of the index test. We quantified
heterogeneity with the I2 statistic, which reflects the
proportion of variation in point estimates among stud-
ies beyond that expected by chance. I2 values less than
25%, 25% to less than 75%, and 75% or greater were
considered to represent low, moderate, and high het-
erogeneity, respectively (16).
We conducted all analyses using R, version 3.2.2
(17), specifically the “mada” package for meta-analysis
of diagnostic accuracy.

(S.J.L.

for AMI. Assessments were made independently, fol-
lowed by a meeting in which discrepancies were iden-
tified and resolved by discussion. When required,
questions were posed to study authors for further clar-
ification before the final assessment. The evaluation
was done using the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of
Diagnostic Accuracy Studies, version 2) tool (18). When
available, information about characteristics and AMI
prevalence for excluded patients was also assessed to
inform judgment of risk of bias.

The Emergency Care Foundation administers a fel-
lowship grant enabling Dr. Pickering to undertake this
and other work. The Emergency Care Foundation had
no role in the design, conduct, or publication of this

were obtained for this study.
RESULTS
The systematic search identified 596 citations, from
which 27 potentially eligible cohorts were identified
(Figure 1). Lead authors and primary investigators were
contacted. An additional 16 cohorts were excluded (Ta-
ble 3 of Supplement 2).
Study Populations
Eleven cohorts with a total of 9241 participants
(range, 166 to 2831 participants) were included (Table)
(4, 19–27). Overall, 63.9% of participants were male
(range, 54.6% to 70.6%), with a mean age of 61.1 years
(range, 54.5 to 70.6 years). Prevalence of AMI ranged
from 7.0% to 23.3%, with an overall prevalence for the
pooled populations of 15.4%. Study inclusion criteria
were reasonably consistent, but there were differences
in exclusion: Renal failure requiring dialysis was speci-
fied in 3 studies (4, 19, 25), and 1 study excluded pa-
tients with atypical presentations, such as fatigue or diz-
ziness (26) (Table 4 of Supplement 2).
Study Methods and Risk of Bias
All studies prospectively recruited patients present-
ing to EDs with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary
syndrome. Three studies enrolled a consecutive sam-
ple of patients, with all eligible patients included in the
present analysis and appropriate exclusions (Table 5 of
Supplement 2) (23–25). Four other cohorts enrolled
consecutive patients during set times of the day (19, 20,
27). Two studies did not perform a second troponin
measurement on some low-risk patients (25, 26). Over-
all, 9 cohorts were classified as having high or unclear
risk of bias for patient selection, study flow, or both (4,
20–23, 25–27). Of these, 3 studies reported additional
information on patient characteristics and outcomes in
eligible patients who were not enrolled or not included
in the analysis, with each study reporting similar or
lower rates of AMI or acute coronary syndrome in ex-
cluded patients (21, 26–28). One study reported on the
proportion of index troponin tests that were indetermi-
nate due to hemolyzed samples (11 of 1167 [0.9%])
(27). All studies performed the index test (hs-cTnT and
ECG) and the reference standard according to a pre-
specified protocol for data collection and reported
data to allow classification at the prespecified LoD and
LoB cut points.
All studies followed Global Task Force recommen-
dations to define AMI, and 10 studies used indepen-
dent adjudication to verify end points. Second blood
samples for clinical care purposes and later outcome
adjudication were drawn at least 6 hours after symptom
onset, except in the 2 studies where no second blood
draw was done for some low-risk patients (25, 26) and
in 1 study where some low-risk patients were dis-
charged after a second blood sample 2 hours after the
first (22). Six cohorts used hs-cTnT clinically and there-
fore also for adjudication purposes (19, 22–24, 26, 27),
one of which had undergone readjudication after the
initial study (19, 29).

 Other cohorts used various clinical troponin mea-
surements, and persons adjudicating outcomes were
blinded to hs-cTnT concentrations (Table 4 of Supple-
ment 2). If the troponin concentration was elevated but
an increase or decrease was not recorded, other causes
of the elevated concentration were considered by the
adjudicators. If no clear alternative cause was evident
and the clinical presentation was suggestive of an acute
coronary syndrome, an adjudicated diagnosis of AMI
was made. In all studies except the Nelson cohort (22),
experienced clinical researchers who were blinded to
the study protocol adjudicated the outcomes. In the
Nelson cohort, adjudicators were not blinded to the
study protocol, but 1 of 2 cardiologists assessed
the outcome and, when necessary, an independent car-
diologist reviewed unclear assessments (Table 4 of
Supplement 2). Six studies received supporting grants
or reagents from Roche (4, 19, 20, 23, 25).
Primary Outcome
The index test classified 30.6% (range, 3.8% to
73.5%) of patients as being at low risk for AMI (Table 6
of Supplement 2). Overall, 14 patients with a negative
test result had AMI (false-negative cases). In 7 of these
cases, the time between symptom onset and blood
sampling was less than 3 hours (<2 hours in 4 cases).
The pooled estimate of sensitivity of this test was 98.7%
(95% CI, 96.6% to 99.5%), with sensitivities of individual
cohorts between 87.5% and 100% (P < 0.001 for test
for equality of sensitivities) (Figure 2). Heterogeneity
was high (I2 = 90.3%). The pooled NPV was 99.3% (CI,
97.3% to 99.8%), and NPVs varied from 96.5% to 100%
(Figure 3). The pooled negative likelihood ratio was
0.04 (CI, 0.02 to 0.08). The RATPAC (Randomised As-
sessment of Treatment Using Panel Assay of Cardiac
Markers) cohort had the greatest proportion of patients
classified as low risk (73.5%) but also had low sensitivity
(89.6%) (Table 6 of Supplement 2). The range of spec-
ificities was broad (Figures 1 and 2 of Supplement 2).
Secondary Outcomes
Eight cohorts (n = 8059) provided data on MACEs
within 30 days. There were 21 MACEs (including index
admission AMI) after a negative index test result. The
pooled estimate of sensitivity for MACEs was 98.0% (CI,
94.7% to 99.3%), with sensitivities in individual cohorts
ranging from 87.9% to 100% (Figure 4 of Supplement 2).
A total of 126 (1.3%) patients died within the 30-
day follow-up, none of whom had been classified as
low risk by the primary index test (Table 6 of Supple-
ment 2).
Sensitivity Analysis
Nine cohorts provided data on index admission
AMI outcomes with the LoB as the threshold for hs-
cTnT. A total of 19.6% of patients were classified as low
risk (hs-cTnT below the LoB and no ischemic changes
on ECG), with a pooled sensitivity of 99.1% (CI, 97.4%
to 99.7%) and NPV of 99.0% (CI, 93.7% to 99.8%) for
index admission AMI (Figure 5 and Table 7 of Supple-
ment 2).
The pooled sensitivity for AMI for the index test
among the cohorts that used hs-cTnT for adjudication
of AMI (19, 22–24) was marginally greater (99.0% [CI,
95.5% to 99.8%]) than that for the cohorts that used
other troponin assays (98.4% [CI, 94.7% to 99.5%]).

 DISCUSSION
In this collaborative meta-analysis, a nonischemic
ECG plus an hs-cTnT concentration less than 0.005
μg/L classified a substantial proportion of patients pre-
senting to EDs with chest pain as being at low risk for
AMI in a diverse sample of international locations. Inte-
grating such an early screening approach into existing
investigative strategies may enable patients to be safely
discharged to outpatient follow-up earlier than in cur-
rent practice.

 random patient selection or exclusions due to missing
data. Recruiting patients 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,
is challenging in the ED setting, and it is almost inevi-
table that some patients will be excluded, if only
because of lack of available staff. In such situations,
characterization of excluded populations would be
valuable.
The prevalence of AMI and the proportion of pa-
tients identified as low risk varied among studies, allow-
ing us to explore the clinical performance of this strat-
egy in populations with different baseline risks. This is
important because, given that this strategy does not
include a formal assessment of risk factors or types of
symptoms, decisions to override or not override the
strategy may vary considerably across sites and among
attending physicians. In this study, the pooled sensitiv-
ity and NPV of this strategy were high; nevertheless, 2
sites had much lower sensitivities (<90%), statistical het-
erogeneity was high, and the lower 95% confidence
bound of the point estimate for sensitivity (96.6%) was
less than the consensus goal of 99% (30), all of which
could indicate that the strategy is not universally safe.
Therefore, although the pooled estimates of sensitivity
and NPV were favorable, we could not make an un-
equivocal recommendation.
The RATPAC cohort, with a sensitivity of 89.6%, had
a notably high proportion of low-risk patients, was
younger and had fewer comorbidities than other co-
horts, and had low prevalence of AMI (8.0%). The Mont-
pellier cohort was the smallest of the studies (n = 166),
and the low sensitivity (87.5%) was due to just 3 false-
negative results. Although these 2 cohorts may be con-
sidered statistical outliers and differences between
these and other studies may be possible to identify, we
do not believe that ignoring them is justifiable. Other
settings are also likely to have differences that result in
low sensitivity. We recommend that implementation be
audited to ensure adequate safety.
Because troponin may not be detectable in the cir-
culation immediately after myocardial injury, some pa-
tients with AMI who present very early after onset of
pain may not have detectable troponin. For this reason,
guidelines recommend a second sample approxi-
mately 3 hours after symptom onset in these patients
(6). We observed that 50% of patients with false-
negative results had blood sampling within 3 hours of
symptom onset and therefore recommend a cautious
approach to implementation to exclude patients pre-
senting soon after symptom onset. Data are currently
insufficient to establish a minimum safe duration below
3 hours.
Using our search strategies, we identified addi-
tional studies that reported use of “undetectable” hs-
cTnT to rule out AMI in patients presenting with chest
pain but were otherwise ineligible for inclusion in this
meta-analysis. The largest was the registry study by
Bandstein and colleagues, which reported that among
8907 patients with initial hs-cTnT concentrations less
than 0.005 μg/L (61% of the cohort), only 15 (0.17%)
had AMI within 30 days where no ischemic changes
had been noted on initial presentation (8). Other stud-
ies defined hs-cTnT detectability thresholds using ei-
ther the LoB (<0.003 μg/L) or the LoD (<0.005 μg/L).
The studies by Aldous and associates reported a sensi-
tivity of 96% for hs-cTnT below the LoB, which is inad-
equate for clinical use (31, 32). Other studies report
sensitivities of 98.2% to 100% for hs-cTnT below the
LoD (4, 5, 8, 33–37).

Rapid Rule-out of AMI With Cardiac Troponin T Measurement

 ety of Cardiology (6) have included diagnostic path-
ways where the first step is to rule out patients if the first
hs-cTnT measurement is less than the LoB (7) or the
LoD (6). A multicenter analysis of the European Society
of Cardiology pathway noted that an hs-cTnT measure-
ment below the LoD was not responsible for any of the
false-negative results recorded (38). In the systematic
review that informed the National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence guidelines (7), 5 studies used LoB
or LoD diagnostic thresholds. These studies were pub-
lished near the time of the release of a technical bulle-
tin (no. 12-023) by Roche Diagnostics, which recom-
mended recalibration of the hs-cTnT assay results from
production batches 157120, 160197, and 163704 from
2009 to 2012 (39). Consequently, some hs-cTnT results
from the affected batches were incorrectly reported as
lower than the true values (in the absence of recalibra-
tion). Wildi and colleagues compared results from the
faulty assays against remeasured samples with an unaf-
fected batch in 867 patients and showed that the incor-
rect results negatively affected rule-out strategies using
low concentrations of hs-cTnT (40). Only 1 of these
studies (41) addressed this issue directly, and 1 other
study (4) reported to us that the batches were not
affected.
The absence of recalibration information in the co-
hort described by Bandstein and colleagues (8) may
explain the large number of patients categorized as
having low risk for AMI in that cohort and the much
smaller proportion of low-risk patients in our analysis—
samples with reported concentrations in the range of
0.003 to 0.008 μg/L may be as much as 0.007 μg/L
higher when correctly calibrated (39, 42). Of note, the
reported hs-cTnT result can easily change from below
to above the LoD after correction or remeasurement; a
previous study found that the number of values below
the LoD decreased from 71.0% to 33.8% after correc-
tion (42). In our meta-analysis, we carefully accounted
for recalibration requirements before performing any
data analysis. No data from miscalibrated batches were
included in our meta-analysis.
The specificity of detectable hs-cTnT was, not sur-
prisingly, poor, given that the proposed threshold
should not be used to rule in AMI, nor should it be used
to identify patients at high risk for AMI. Several hs-cTnT
algorithms have been proposed and evaluated that in-
clude a separate rule-in threshold for hs-cTnT (38, 43,
44).
Because the LoD and LoB are assay specific and
future troponin T assays may have different values, it is
important to recognize that this analysis applies to a
specific assay and not to the use of the LoD or LoB for
all assays. Also, the analytic reliability of the LoD as
a cutoff is vulnerable to variation in manufacturer
batches. Furthermore, variation in setup, calibration,
and operation of analyzers in laboratories at individual
sites means that, in practice, expecting these assays to
universally perform well and consistently at such low
values is optimistic.
Limitations of this study include intercohort varia-
tion in troponin assays used to adjudicate outcomes.
There were also methodological differences in out-
come adjudication among the studies, including varia-
tion in the timing of late (second) reference troponin
samples (Table 4 of Supplement 2). There was consid-
erable heterogeneity, which we were unable to assess
by
patient-level
metaregression
because
patient-
specific data could not be shared. Seven studies iden-
tified as possibly meeting inclusion criteria declined to
participate or did not respond to our invitation. On the
basis of the apparent timing of hs-cTnT measurement,
4 of those studies may have used assay batches af-
fected by the calibration error.
Future research should include an assessment of
the current strategy in combination with a validated di-
agnostic strategy that accounts for risk factors and
symptoms on presentation, such as those found in the
HEART (History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and initial Tro-
ponin) (45), ADAPT (2-Hour Accelerated Diagnostic
Protocol to Assess Patients With Chest Pain Symptoms
Using Contemporary Troponins as the Only Biomarker)
(46), and EDACS (Emergency Department Assessment
of Chest pain Score) (47) pathways. The National Insti-
tute for Health and Care Excellence has recently recom-
mended this approach in conjunction with an LoD strat-
egy (48). The incorporation of risk and symptoms may
reassure physicians of the safety of the early rule-out
strategy, although possibly at the risk of lower efficacy.
In addition, further research on hs-cTnT kinetics is
needed to establish the minimum safe duration after
symptom onset for the first blood sample. Finally, a
pragmatic implementation trial to assess the perfor-
mance of the strategy in a real-life ED setting is re-
quired. This may include assessments of the cost-
efficacy and the costs and benefits of the strategy.
In conclusion, this meta-analysis of 11 clinically and
geographically diverse cohorts using hs-cTnT results
assessed the safety of an early rule-out strategy for AMI.
In most but not all settings, patients investigated for
acute coronary syndrome with hs-cTnT below the LoD
and a nonischemic ECG had very low risk for AMI or for
MACEs within 30 days. The point estimate for sensitivity
was 98.7% (CI, 96.6% to 99.5%). Acute myocardial in-
farction may be ruled out in a substantial proportion of
patients after only 1 blood draw. At this time, we do not
recommend a single–blood draw strategy in patients
presenting within 3 hours of symptom onset. Moreover,
because the strategy had considerable heterogeneity
of sensitivity among sites, it should not be used without
careful additional clinical assessment to identify pa-
tients with a high likelihood of underlying critical coro-
nary stenosis. Local audits of implementation should
take place to ensure safety and efficacy.
