Purpose
Oral targeted therapies represent a significant advance for the treatment of patients with chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); however, their high cost has raised concerns about affordability and the
economic impact on society. Our objective was to project the future prevalence and cost burden of
CLL in the era of oral targeted therapies in the United States.
Methods
We developed a simulation model that evaluated the evolving management of CLL from 2011 to 2025:
chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) as the standard of care before 2014, oral targeted therapies for patients
with del(17p) and relapsed CLL from 2014, and for first-line treatment from 2016 onward. A com-
parator scenario also was simulated where CIT remained the standard of care throughout. Disease
progression and survival parameters for each therapy were based on published clinical trials.
Results
The number of people living with CLL in the United States is projected to increase from 128,000 in 2011 to
199,000 by 2025 (55% increase) due to improved survival; meanwhile, the annual cost of CLL man-
agement will increase from $0.74 billion to $5.13 billion (590% increase). The per-patient lifetime cost of
CLL treatment will increase from $147,000 to $604,000 (310% increase) as oral targeted therapies
become the first-line treatment. For patients enrolled in Medicare, the corresponding total out-of-pocket
cost will increase from $9,200 to $57,000 (520% increase). Compared with the CIT scenario, oral targeted
therapies resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $189,000 per quality-adjusted life-year.
Conclusion
The increased benefit and cost of oral targeted therapies is projected to enhance CLL survivorship
but can impose a substantial financial burden on both patients and payers. More sustainable pricing
strategies for targeted therapies are needed to avoid financial toxicity to patients.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most
prevalent leukemia in the western world. In the
United States, approximately 130,000 patients live
with CLL, and approximately 15,000 new cases
occur every year.1 Although most patients with
CLL have early-stage disease at the time of initial
diagnosis and are recommended for watchful
waiting,2 the majority eventually require treat-
ment, typically after a few years of observation,
and often experience prolonged survival.3,4
Chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) regimens, such
as fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab
(FCR), have been the standard first-line treatment
of young patients with CLL.5,6 In a single-center
experience, the FCR regimen led to a complete
remission rate of 72% and a median progression-
free survival (PFS) of 80 months.7,8 Subsequently,
the German CLL8 trial established FCR as the
standard first-line therapy.6 For patients older
than 65 years or with comorbidities, the com-
bination of chlorambucil and obinutuzumab is
considered standard of care on the basis of the
results of the CLL11 trial.9
In the past few years, major strides have been
made in understanding the biology of CLL, which
have led to significant advances in the treatment
of CLL. In particular, oral targeted agents, such as
ibrutinib and idelalisib, have demonstrated re-
markable outcomes in patients with CLL. In the
relapsed setting, ibrutinib showed an overall re-
sponse rate (ORR) of 90% and estimated PFS of

 69% at 30 months10; idelalisib showed an ORR of 72% and median
PFS of 15.8 months as monotherapy in a phase I study11 and an
ORR of 81% and estimated overall survival (OS) of 92% at
12 months when used in combination with rituximab in a phase III
study.12 In 2014, the Food and Drug Administration approved two
oral targeted therapies: ibrutinib for patients with relapsed/
refractory CLL and for patients with del(17p) and idelalisib in
combination
with
rituximab
for
patients
with
relapsed/
refractory CLL. In March 2016, ibrutinib was approved for
first-line management of CLL. In addition, several other targeted
therapies are expected to become available in the near future.13
Venetoclax was approved for patients with relapsed CLL with del
(17p) in April 2016.14 These novel therapies have revolutionized
the CLL treatment paradigm.
However, the high cost of these targeted therapies raises
concerns for payers as well as for patients.15,16 Both ibrutinib and
idelalisib are priced at approximately $130,000 per year and are
recommended until patients have progressive disease or significant
toxicities. In contrast, the costs for CIT-based treatments range
from $60,000 to $100,000 for a finite duration, that is, a typical six-
cycle course that lasts for approximately 6 months. Therefore,
novel targeted therapies could strain the budget of both private and
government payers, such as Medicare, and copayments and other
expenses can be a substantial burden to patients, yet the budget
impact and cost-effectiveness of these therapies are not well un-
derstood. Our objective for this study was to project the changing
economic as well as disease burden of CLL in the United States in
the era of targeted therapies and to evaluate the affordability and
value of these new therapies.
METHODS
We developed a microsimulation model, simCLL (simulation model of
CLL management), that simulated the dynamics of the CLL patient
population under given management strategies in the United States from
2011 to 2025.
Patient Population
Patient characteristics were defined by age, phase of CLL treatment
(watchful waiting, first line, or relapse), and del(17p) status. Age at di-
agnosis for each individual patient was sampled from the age distribution
on the basis of SEER data between 2000 and 2011.17 Del(17p) was assumed
to be present in 7% of the CLL patient population.18 New CLL cases were
added to the simulated population in each year on the basis of published
annual incidence estimates from the American Cancer Society1 (Data Sup-
plement). The prevalence of CLL from the simulation model was calibrated to
SEER data between 2000 and 2011 (Data Supplement).
Simulated Clinical Pathways
We modeled the clinical course of patients with CLL by using
a patient-level state-transition model, which included the following
health states: watchful waiting, first-line treatment, relapse, and death
(Data Supplement). The majority of patients with a new diagnosis of CLL
do not need immediate treatment4 and were assumed to start in the
watchful waiting state.19 (The probability was determined through the
model calibration.) Upon failure of first-line treatment, patients entered
the relapse state. The probabilities of health state transitions were esti-
mated on the basis of time to treatment, PFS, and OS data from clinical
trials (Table 1; Data Supplement). We selected the trials that represent the
best available evidence (eg, phase III trials, large observational studies)
for the major regimens in general practice, with reference to clinical
guidelines4 and expert opinions. We also validated our model by com-
paring the simulated survival curves with observed survival data (Data
Supplement). Finally, we applied age-specific background mortality on
the basis of US life tables.31
Treatment Strategies
A treatment strategy defined the specific therapy for a patient by
status of relapse, fitness (determined by age), del(17p), and year of
treatment (Fig 1). We first simulated a clinical scenario that considered
the current standard of care and emerging treatment options (Fig 1A).
In particular, before 2014, CIT was the mainstay treatment of patients
with CLL. The most common choices for first-line treatment were FCR
for fit patients and chlorambucil for unfit patients. From 2014 on, oral
targeted therapies were approved for patients with relapsed CLL and for
patients with del(17p).12,32 From 2016 on, oral targeted therapies became
the standard of care in the first-line setting.21 This scenario is referred to as
the oral targeted therapy scenario.
For comparison, we simulated a scenario where CIT would have
remained the standard of care in the future (Fig 1B). In this scenario, first-
line therapy for unfit patients would be obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil
after 2014.9 This scenario is referred to as the CIT scenario.
Costs
Direct medical costs were considered, including the cost of drugs
and administration, routine follow-up, and management of adverse
events. Drug costs were calculated on the basis of doses of the standard
regimen and average sales price of each drug. Average sales price was
estimated as 26% lower than the average wholesale price (AWP; Table 1,
Data Supplement),33 as suggested by an Office of the Inspector General
study.30 For oral targeted agents, drug costs were accumulated for an
indefinite period until treatment was discontinued. As observed in the
clinical studies with ibrutinib, 87% of patients in the first-line setting
and 75% in the relapsed setting would continue oral targeted therapy
beyond 18 months.21,34
Administration costs, such as for physician visits and chemotherapy
infusions, were calculated on the basis of the Medicare physician fee
schedule35 (Table 2; Data Supplement) by using an approach described
elsewhere.43 Common serious adverse events, including grade 3/4
infection and hematologic toxicities, were simulated on the basis of
the reported incidence for each therapy (Table 1), and the management
cost for each was derived from the corresponding treatment and
hospitalization costs41 (Table 2). We also considered the risk and the
cost of atrial fibrillation with oral targeted therapy because atrial
fibrillation has emerged as an important concern with ibrutinib
treatment.43
Health-Related Quality of Life
The health-related quality-of-life weights (utilities) were adjusted
by health states and patient age.37,44 We assumed a utility of 1 in the
watchful waiting state. For the first-line treatment state, utility was
determined by response type (ie, complete, partial, no response), which
was sampled according to the response rate of the treatment. In ad-
dition, the utilities were adjusted on the basis of patient age,45 and
disutility was applied to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide–containing
regimens.39,46
Model Outcomes
We projected the number of people living with CLL and the annual
cost of CLL management in the United States from 2011 to 2025. In
addition, we calculated per-patient lifetime cost with oral targeted ther-
apies as well as with CIT as the standard of care. Because the majority of
patients are older than 65 years at the time of CLL diagnosis and are

Economic Burden of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
 covered by Medicare, we also estimated the lifetime out-of-pocket cost
of the oral targeted therapies for patients enrolled in Medicare Part D
(Data Supplement). We estimated total discounted person-life-years (LYs)
and person-quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs) as the total health outcomes at
the population level from 2011 to 2025 and finally estimated the incre-
mental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of oral targeted therapies compared
with the CIT scenario. All costs were converted to 2015 US dollars. In the
cost-effectiveness analysis, future outcomes were discounted to the value in
2015 at 3% per year. For simplicity, we present the rounded values of all
numerical results.
Sensitivity Analysis
To evaluate the robustness of outcomes against uncertainty in model
inputs, we performed one-way deterministic sensitivity analyses. Utilities
and probabilities of discontinuation of oral targeted therapies were varied
within their reported CI, other transition probabilities and costs were varied
within a 20% range, and survival distributions were adjusted with hazard
ratios between 0.8 and 1.2. We also performed a probabilistic sensitivity
analysis that accounted for joint uncertainty in all model inputs.
In addition, we performed two scenario analyses. First, with con-
sideration of the aging US population (Data Supplement),47 we adjusted

 the CLL incidence with the US population projection data (Data Supple-
ment) and simulated a scenario with a higher CLL incidence rate. Second, we
evaluated a scenario that simulated partial uptake of oral targeted therapies,
which represents a gradual transition from CIT. Specifically, we assumed
25% use of oral targeted therapies in first-line treatment for fit patients after
approval in 2016 and increased by 25% every year until a full use in 2019 and
beyond.
RESULTS
Disease Burden
The total number of people living with CLL is projected to
increase from 128,000 in 2011 to 199,000 (55% increase) in 2025
due to improved survival with the use of oral targeted therapies. In
contrast, if CITremains the standard of care, the number of people
living with CLL would be 162,000 (26% increase) by 2025 (Fig 2A).
Cost Burden
Annual cost of CLL care. Under the oral targeted therapy sce-
nario, the annual cost of CLL management is projected to increase
from $0.74 billion in 2011 to $5.13 billion (593% increase) in 2025
(Fig 2B). The first surge in the annual cost occurred in 2014 when
oral targeted therapies became available for patients who relapsed,
and the second surge will occur in 2016 because of the approval of
oral targeted therapy in the first-line setting. In contrast to the
increasing cost trend with oral targeted therapies, the annual cost
under the CITscenario would have remained relatively stable from
2014 on, reaching $1.12 billion in 2025. Compared with the CIT
scenario, oral targeted therapies would result in an additional
spending of $29 billion from their availability in 2014 until 2025.
Among the total cost of CLL management, drug costs constituted
96% in the oral targeted therapy scenario and 86% in the CIT
scenario.
Lifetime cost of CLL treatment. The per-person lifetime cost of
CLL treatment of patients initiating therapy in 2011 was $147,000,
which increased to $331,000 (125% increase) for patients who ini-
tiated therapy in 2014 (Fig 3A). For patients who initiated oral therapy
(now approved in the first-line setting) in 2016, the lifetime cost of
CLL treatment is projected to reach $604,000 (310% increase from
2011).
Out-of-pocket cost for Medicare patients. The majority of
patients with CLL in the United States are covered by Medicare and
have drug coverage through Medicare Part D. The out-of-pocket
cost of oral agents for Medicare patients was estimated on the basis
of deductible and coverage limits in Medicare Part D plan (Data
Supplement)48 and was estimated to be $9,200 for those initiating
therapy in 2011, which increased to $27,000 (193% increase) for
patients who initiated therapy in 2014 and to $57,000 (519%
increase) for those who initiate treatment from 2016 on (Fig 3B).
Use of oral targeted therapies in the first-line setting after 2016 also
substantially increased the first-line treatment cost, which con-
stituted the major proportion of the lifetime cost.
Cost-effectiveness Analysis
From 2011 to 2025, the total discounted health outcomes
were 1,850,000 person-QALYs (2,193,000 person-LYs) under
the oral targeted therapy scenario and 1,743,000 person-QALYs
(2,044,000 person-LYs) under the CIT scenario. Compared with
the CIT scenario, the oral targeted therapy scenario resulted in
an increase of 107,000 person-QALYs (149,000 person-LYs),
with additional discounted costs of $20.2 billion. The ICER of
oral targeted therapies was $189,000/QALY ($136,000/LY).

Economic Burden of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
 Sensitivity Analysis
We examined the sensitivity of results to oral drug cost dis-
counts. With consideration of a 37% discount off the AWP as the
lowest price paid by private sector payers for drug products,49 the
total incremental cost was $24 billion, lifetime out-of-pocket cost
for patients with first-line oral targeted therapy was $52,000, and
ICER of oral targeted therapy was $161,000/QALY (Data Sup-
plement). When the oral targeted agent cost is reduced to 50% of
AWP, the ICER reduces to $107,000/QALY. A threshold cost
analysis showed that the cost of oral targeted therapies needs to be
at least 69% lower than the current AWP to bring the ICER below
$50,000/QALY threshold.
One-way sensitivity analysis showed that the cost of CLL
management is sensitive to treatment cost, discontinuation rate of
oral targeted therapies, immediate treatment probability at initial
visit, and time to first-line treatment from the watchful waiting
state (Data Supplement). The ICER was most sensitive to survival
distributions of treatments as well as to health-related utilities for
partial response in first-line treatment and in the relapse setting
(Fig 4A). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that oral targeted
therapy was deemed cost-effective with a very low probability even
at a willingness-to-pay as high as $150,000/QALY (Fig 4B). We also
found that an increase in CLL incidence because of the aging US
population would further escalate the cost burden and reduce the
cost-effectiveness of oral targeted therapies, and the partial uptake
of first-line oral targeted therapies for fit patients resulted in limited
changes to all model results and would not change the conclusions
(Data Supplement).
DISCUSSION
Oral targeted therapies represent a major advance for patients with
CLL, with improvement in OS compared with conventional
therapies.21 Our study projected an increase in the number people
living with CLL over time, largely due to improved survival in the
era of oral targeted therapies; we also projected a substantial in-
crease in the cost of CLL management. The annual cost of CLL

 management is projected to reach $5.13 billion by 2025, a 590%
increase from that in 2011. The cost of new therapies will add
considerable financial burden to both patients and payers. At the
current price, oral therapies are not deemed cost-effective on the
basis of the willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY.
This study provides a comprehensive view and analysis of
the changing burden of CLL care in the United States. To our
knowledge, no study has evaluated the cost-effectiveness of oral
targeted cancer therapies from a population level. Earlier studies on
the cost of CLL did not consider recent data and changing pop-
ulation dynamics. One study found that the lifetime cost of CLL
treatment of Medicare patients is $87,000 based on data from older
drug regimens from 1999 to 2007.50 Another study by Shanafelt
et al15 estimated the annual societal cost of CLL to be $0.73 billion
with CITand $2.63 and $1.24 billion with ibrutinib in the first- and
second-line settings, respectively. However, their estimates were
lower than our projections because they did not account for the
growing disease population due to improved survival. Our results
highlight the expected societal impact of the rising disease burden
from CLL that would compound the increased cost associated with
long-term oral therapy.
Our study has several limitations. First, the model did not
consider all possible treatment sequences in practice. We also did
not account for individual practice patterns that deviate from
standard of care and guidelines because no data exist for com-
prehensive utilization estimates for each treatment option.
However, we believe that our approach is sufficient to capture the
most commonly accepted practice patterns and population-level
trends in costs and prevalence of CLL. Second, we considered
constant drug prices and did not capture the possible fluctuation of
drug prices over time in reality. We performed a series of sensitivity
analyses on drug prices and found that the results remain valid

Economic Burden of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
 across a wide range of drug price discounts and that the oral
therapies could be deemed cost-effective if the prices were at least
69% lower than our current AWP estimates.
Although the cost of cancer care is rising, the results indicate
that the rising trend in the cost of CLL management will outpace
that of other cancers. The annual cost of cancer care in the United
States is expected to increase by 27%-50% from $143 billion in
2010 to $180 billion in 2020.51 For breast and prostate cancers, the
annual cost of care is expected to increase by 24%-38% from 2010
to 2020. In contrast, the annual cost of the CLL is estimated to
increase by 500% from $0.7 billion in 2011 to $4.2 billion in 2020.
The substantial increase in the cost of CLL management is mainly
driven by the high cost of oral targeted drugs and prolonged
treatment duration along with improved survival. Although the
current analysis suggests that the cost of CLL management will rise
faster than that of other cancers, future advances in treatments
could increase the costs of care of other cancers as well. Such an
increase could strain the budget of private as well as government
payers.
Patients also will experience the escalating cost burden of
expensive treatments because the higher overall cost could translate
into higher health insurance premiums and cost sharing for in-
dividual patients.52 One study found that medical bankruptcies
ranks number one (67%) of all US family bankruptcies because
out-of-pocket costs range from $18,000 to $27,000.53 The current
results show that the lifetime out-of-pocket costs of CLL treatment
for Medicare patients is expected to increase approximately
fourfold to $57,000 for those who initiate first-line oral targeted
therapy after 2016, which could further exacerbate the likelihood of
medical bankruptcy and result in discontinuation of treatment.
The high out-of-pocket costs not only causes material financial
hardship as one survey showed that 12% of patients with cancer
could not cover their share of medical care cost, but also could lead to
psychological financial hardship.16 Furthermore, high out-of-pocket

 costs could result in disparities in access to these therapies. For
example, patients with CLL with lower income levels may not be
able to afford these therapies, which will adversely affect their out-
comes. Their health could remain suboptimal, even in the era of oral
targeted therapies.54,55
High drug prices have been a disturbing concern not only in
the area of CLL management but also in the setting of cancer care in
general. The average annual cost of cancer treatment before 2000
was , $10,000, which has now increased to . $100,000.56,57 A
recently published systematic review found that the majority of
drugs for hematologic malignancies are not cost-effective at their
current prices.58 A similar trend is observed for other cancer
treatments.59-61 The cost of care has become an important com-
ponent of delivering high-quality care.62-64
We do not recommend that clinicians choose less-effective
management strategies; instead, we propose that the price of oral
targeted therapies be reduced such that the treatment becomes
cost-effective and more affordable. Besides a price reduction,
strategies to optimize the drug and dose schedule are needed.
Minimal residual disease–negative remissions have been reported
with drugs such as venetoclax. Clinical trials are needed to ascertain
whether drug discontinuation in patients who meet certain pa-
rameters (eg, minimal residual disease–negative remission) would
be an effective approach. Similar approaches have been used in
patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who have received
imatinib.65
In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive analysis
of the changing prevalence and cost of CLL care in the United
States. Oral targeted therapies will increase survival rates sub-
stantially; however, with the current price structure, they will
dramatically increase the cost of CLL management for both
patients and payers. Such an economic impact could result in
financial toxicity, limited access, and lower adherence to the oral
therapies, which may undermine their clinical effectiveness. A
more sustainable pricing strategy is needed for oral targeted
therapies.
