Abstract
Background: Restaurant workers are at risk from exposure to toxic compounds from burning of fuel and fumes
from cooking. However, the literature is almost silent on the issue. What discussion that can be found in the
literature focuses on the potential effects from biomass smoke exposure in the home kitchen, and does not address
the problem as occurring in the workplace, particularly in restaurants.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey of 224 worker from 142 food restaurants in the Tha Pho sub-district of
Phitsanulok, a province in Thailand. The standard questionnaire from the British Medical Research Council was used
to collect data on chronic respiratory symptoms, including cough, phlegm, dyspnea, severe dyspnea, stuffy nose in
the participating workers. Data on their health symptoms experienced in the past 30 days was also asked. A
constructed questionnaire was used to collect exposure data, including type of job, time in the kitchen, the
frequency of frying food, tears while cooking (TWC), the type of restaurant, fuel used for cooking, the size and
location of the kitchen, and the exhaust system and ventilation. The prevalence of the symptoms was compared
with those obtained from 395 controls, who were neighbors of the participants who do not work in a restaurant.
Results: In comparison to the control group, the restaurant workers had twice or more the prevalence on most of
the chronic health symptoms. Men had a higher risk for “dyspnea”, “stuffy nose” and “wheeze” while women had
higher risk of “cough”. A Rate Ratio (RR) of susceptibility was established, which ranged from 1.4 up to 9.9. The
minimum RR was for women with “severe dyspnea” (RR of 1.4, 95%CI 0.8, 2.5) while the men showed the maximum
RR of 9.9 (95%CI 4.5–22.0) for “wheeze”. Possible risk factors identified were job description, job period, size of
restaurant, kitchen location, type of cooking oil, hours of stay in the kitchen area, number of fry dishes prepared,
frequency of occurrence of TWC, and additional cooking at home. Working for 6–10 year increased the risk of
“cough” with an Odd Ratio (OR) of 3.19 (P < 0.01) while working for more than 10 years increased the risk of
“cough” (OR = 3.27, P < 0.01), “phlegm” (OR = 3.87, P = 0.01) and “wheeze” (OR = 2.38, P = 0.05). Working as a chef
had a higher risk of “cough” by 2.33 (P = 0.01) as comparing to other jobs. Workers in a relatively large restaurant
using 4 or more stoves had increased risk of “wheeze” with OR of 3.81 (P < 0.01) and “stuffy nose” with OR of 3.56
(P < 0.01). Using vegetable oil increased the risk of “stuffy nose” by 2.94 (P < 0.01). Every 10 h of stay in the kitchen
area was associated with a minimal increase in the risk of “cough”, “wheeze” and “symptoms in the past 30 days” by
1.15 (P = 0.02), 1.16 (P = 0.01) and 1.16 (P = 0.02), respectively.

Conclusions: Restaurant workers are at risk of respiratory symptoms caused by exposure to toxic compounds from
cooking fumes. Job description, job period, size of restaurant, kitchen location, type of cooking oil, hours of stay in
the kitchen area, number of fry dishes prepared, frequency of occurrence of TWC, and additional cooking at home
were the predictive factors. Workplace Health and Safety protection of restaurant worker is urgently needed and
the issue should receive more public attention.

Background
Running a restaurant is one of the most common busi-
nesses with possibly millions of workers involved. How-
ever, the health and safety of these workers is often
overlooked. Restaurant workers are at risk from expos-
ure to toxic compounds from burning of fuel and fumes
from cooking. Nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and
particulate matter from fuel combustion may affect the
development or exacerbation of asthma, for example [1].
Under high temperatures, degradation of sugar and fat,
and pyrolysis of proteins and amino acids, may create
respiratory irritant compounds, such as acrolein and for-
maldehyde [2]. It was been reported that smoke from
burning fuel and fumes from cooking contain many
toxic substances, some of which are carcinogenic, such
as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), amines,
benzene and formaldehyde [3, 4]. An elevation of aero-
sols is also commonly reported during cooking [5], de-
pending on the type of oil, temperature and type of food
[6]. Among the different types of cooking, deep frying
emits the most PM2.5, followed by frying, stir frying,
boiling and steaming [7]. A survey of restaurants in sev-
eral locations found harmful levels of various pollutants.
Measurement of air samples in a Korean style restaurant
in Hong Kong, for instance, found PM10, PM2.5 and car-
bon monoxide (1 h average) at the level of 1.44, 1.17 and
15.10 mg/m3 [8]. Benzene, toluene, methylene chloride
and chloroform were also detected. Siao et al. [9] reported
elevated levels of PM2.5 and PAH in Chinese and Indian
style restaurants. Researcher have also reported elevated
levels of genotoxicant (8-OHdG) in male kitchen workers
[10]. Women (and presumably men also) who cook at
home are exposed to toxic compounds [11].
Most available literature has reported a positive associ-
ation between cooking fumes and lung cancer, with
some predictive factors, including job description, type
of cooking oil, exhaust hood, oil temperature, deep fry
and stir fry cooking [12, 13]. The risk of lung cancer per
10 dish-year among those who deep fry, fry and stir fry
was found to be 2.56, 1.47 and 1.12, respectively [14].
Use of biomass fuel has also been related to PM2.5 and
Cr (VI) and risk of lung cancer [15]. However, there have
only been a few studies which focused on the respiratory
health of restaurant workers [16]. A study of kitchen
workers in Norway reported an increased work related
risk of dyspnea, severe dyspnea and other health symp-
toms among women employees [17]. However, the study
also found “working in the kitchen” as the only predict-
ive risk factor. Adewole et al. [18] also reported an ele-
vated risk of cough, chest tightness, congestion and
wheezing among kitchen workers in Nigeria. However, a
recent study in Hong Kong [19] failed to find a signifi-
cant difference in the prevalence of respiratory symp-
toms between restaurant worker cooking with gas and
those cooking with electricity. Therefore, it is suggested
that more studies are needed to identify more risk
factors.
This was the purpose of this study, to survey the oc-
currence of symptoms of work-related health issues
among restaurant workers in Thailand, given the unique
cooking style
found in Thai restaurants, with
the
intention of identifying a comprehensive set of risk fac-
tors that may arise from the different food preparation
methods in Thai restaurants, and any other factors relat-
ing to the health and even cultural backgrounds of
workers in Thai restaurants.
Methods
Tha Pho is a small rural community with the total area
of 50.7 km2, and population of 23,130 people (9314 men,
13,816 women). The main occupation of the villagers is
rice farming. There are no industrial plants in the dis-
trict. The only business facility in the community is Nar-
esuan University [20]. This study includes only those
food restaurants located outside the university.
By using the consecutive sampling technique, this
cross-sectional study was able to recruit 142 food restau-
rants: 82 serving Thai cuisine à la carte, 23 noodle res-
taurants, 31 restaurants serving pre-prepared food, and
6 papaya salad restaurants. A brief explanation is war-
ranted here, on the type of restaurants stated, and the
implication of each of them in our study. Restaurants
serving Thai cuisine cooked many dishes by frying in oil,
given the nature of many Thai dishes. In noodle restau-
rants, the food is prepared predominantly by boiling in
water, with little or no use of oil for cooking. Restaurants

 serving pre-prepared food, which then laid out the vari-
ous foods in bain marie’s or other warming devices, usu-
ally did not prepare the food on-site, so no cooking took
place in that restaurant. Finally, restaurants serving pa-
paya salad as their usual product usually cooked very lit-
tle of their ingredients by oil or boiling water. The
relative prevalence of oil cooking did affect our results,
as will be discussed further.
All workers in each restaurant were interviewed by 9
village health volunteers. Prior to collection of the data,
the volunteers were informed of the study purposes and
the data collection procedure, which used a question-
naire, which was also carefully discussed. The survey
was conducted in the period of October to December
2014, winter time in Thailand, during which season
average daily temperatures are about 30 °C with minimal
rainfall. Weather conditions therefore did not affect the
health status of the workers. Data regarding respiratory
health, type of job and kitchen smoke exposure were
collected. Duration in the kitchen was measured with
“hours per week working in a kitchen” (the number of
hours per working day multiplied by the number of days
worked per week in a kitchen). Frying frequency was
measured by “fry-dishes prepared per week” (the number
of fry-dishes per day multiplied by number of day frying
food in a week). Information on tears while cooking
(TWC), the type of restaurant, fuel used for cooking, the
size and location of the kitchen, the exhaust system and
ventilation was also collected.
The questions on respiratory health were based on
a standard questionnaire for chronic lung disease de-
veloped by the British Medical Research [21] and
American Thoracic Association (ATS-DLD-78 ques-
tionnaire) [22]. Respiratory health data elicited in-
cluded prevalence of cough, phlegm, dyspnea, severe
dyspnea, wheeze and other related symptoms of re-
spiratory problems. Participants were attributed with
a “cough” if they reported chronic cough with or
without phlegm for as much as 4 to 6 times a day, 4
or more days out of the week. “Phlegm” was reported
as having only sputum but no cough for as much as
twice
a
day,
4
or
more
days
out
of
the
week.
“Wheeze” referred to those who breathe with whist-
ling sound. “Dyspnea” referred to those with any of
shortness of breath. “Severe dyspnea” is those with
shortness of breath even when undertaking ordinary
activities. “Stuffy nose” referred to other who with
stuffy nose with a cold. Data on the prevalence of re-
spiratory health symptoms occurring during the past
30 days (“symptoms in 30 days”) was also collected.
The criteria symptoms included in this survey were
coughing, having sputum, sore throat, shortness of
breath or chest tightness, wheezing, nasal irritation or
nasal congestion, allergic symptom and having a cold.
The control group consisted of neighbors who did not
work in a restaurant and who lived at least 50 m away
from a restaurant. For each study subject, 2 unmatched
control subjects were interviewed using the same ques-
tionnaire. In this study, data from 224 cases and 395
controls were included for statistical analysis.
Data was analyzed using SPSS v.22 for Windows and
OpenEpi v.3.01 (online). The prevalence rate was com-
puted using descriptive statistics. Prevalence and RR of
health symptoms in each gender among the study sub-
jects and the control group were compared using
Cochran’s and Mantel-Haenszel statistics, controlling for
age and tobacco consumption. Predictive risk factors
were identified using binary logistic regressions adjusted
for age and tobacco consumption.
Results
The study population was primarily women (67% in
study group and 56% in control group) with a similar
mean age of around 40 years in both the study and con-
trol groups (Table 1). Most of them were chefs (65.6%)
and the rest working as both assistant chef and waitress.
In the study group, the average time working in this oc-
cupation and the average time staying in this particular
type of work (i.e. cook, waiter) was similar, 7 years. The
average time staying in a kitchen was 41 h/week for
women participants and 32 h/week for men, which was
much higher than for the control group (8 h/week for
women and 4 h/week for men). Compared to men,
women cooked fried food more often with an average
number of fried dishes per week of 3448.2 for the
women, and 1801.6 for the men. Smoking was more
common among men, with 44.0% in the study group
and 53.5% in the control group, while only 3.4% of the
women in the study group smoked, compared to 3.2% of
the women in the control group. Between 64.5% and
91.0% of all participants reported that they also cook at
home.
Most of the participants worked in restaurants serving
Thai cuisine à la carte (57.6%) (Table 1). Most of the res-
taurants are small in size, 70% having 1–3 cooking
stoves, 71.4% using LPG for cooking, and 79.5% using
vegetable oil for cooking. Up to 20% of the restaurants
operated without a separated kitchen room, and 50%
without a ventilation hood. Most of the study subjects
reported frying food with the median number of 350 fry-
dish per week. Both study and control group reported
cooking at home, with 60.3% cooking every day and
29.5% cooking some days.
Prevalence of respiratory symptoms
The restaurant workers surveyed had a significantly
higher prevalence of all chronic respiratory symptoms
than the control group, except for severe dyspnea

 (Table 2). The three symptoms with the highest preva-
lence among women were dyspnea, stuffy nose and
cough; and among men were stuffy nose, wheeze and
cough. The RR of the participants and the control group,
after adjusting for age and smoking, was between 1.4
(95%CI 0.8, 2.5) for severe dyspnea in women and 9.9
(95%CI 4.5–22.0) for wheeze in men. Women were at
greater risk of “cough”, “phlegm” and “wheeze”, with
men at greater risk of “wheeze”, “stuffy nose” and
“dyspnea”.
It was also found that the restaurant workers displayed
a greater number of symptoms in the past 30 days than
the control group. The symptoms with significant RR
were shortness of breath, coughing, having sputum, sore

 throat, wheezing and having a cold (Table 1). Of the fe-
male participants, 42.5% had a cough, 25.2% had a cold
and 25.2% had a sore throat. The men’s most common
symptoms were coughing (54.7%), sore throat (34.7%)
and having sputum (33.3%).
Risk factors for health symptoms
For factors creating chronic risks to the health of res-
taurant workers are presented in Table 3. When com-
pared with the other types of restaurants, working in an
à la carte restaurant showed an increased risk of “cough”
and “phlegm” but the related OR were not statistically
significant. Comparisons between the various different
types of restaurant did not show any significant associ-
ation between types of restaurant and prevalence of
chronic symptoms. The role of chef showed a higher risk
of “cough” and “dyspnea”. Working in a restaurant with
a separated kitchen room was associated with “wheeze”
and “stuffy nose”, while workers in a large restaurant
with more than 3 stoves had a risk of “wheeze” 3.82
times those in small shops, with “stuffy nose” being 3.56
times those in small shops. Using vegetable oils (soybean
and palm oil) showed a higher risk of “stuffy nose” than
when lard (pig fat) was used. TWC every day can predict
the risk of “cough”, “wheeze” and “stuffy nose” while
TWC on some days can predict all symptoms except
“wheeze” and “severe dyspnea”. TWC can also predict
the trend of risk for “cough” and “stuffy nose”.
Some risk factors were associated with various health
outcomes in a dose–response trend. A 1 h stay in the
kitchen and the frequency of frying food were associated
with most of the survey symptoms. Job period associated
with “cough” in a dose–response style and working for
more than 10 years increased the risk of “phlegm”,
“wheeze”, “dyspnea”. An additional 10 h stay per week in
the kitchen area increased the risk of “cough” by 15%
and “wheeze” by 16%. Frying 351–745 dish per week
predicted a risk of “cough” and “stuffy nose” and frying
746 or more predicted all the symptoms, except “dys-
pnea” and “severe dyspnea”. Fuel type cannot signifi-
cantly predict any health outcome, statistically. Having a
kitchen ventilation hood seemed to increase the risk of
some symptoms but none were statistically significant.
This point is discussed further elsewhere. Those workers
who cook every day at home had a greater risk of
“cough”, “wheeze”, “dyspnea” and “stuffy nose” than
those who did not cook at home, and those who cooked
at home only on some days had an increased risk of
“stuffy nose”.
It was also found that there were many factors associ-
ated with symptoms in the past 30 days. Working in a
restaurant with a separated kitchen room increased the
risk of having a cold 3.46 times greater than those work-
ing in a restaurant without separated kitchen room
(Table 4). Using vegetable oil increased risk of having a
cold (OR = 2.8, P = 0.03). Size of restaurant predicted the
risk of coughing (OR = 1.82, P = 0.04), having sputum
(OR = 2.10, P = 0.02), sore throat (OR = 2.51, P < 0.01),
allergic symptom (OR = 2.37, P = 0.05), and having any
one symptoms (OR = 3.57, P < 0.01). This latter finding
may also explain the greater risk inherent in having a
separated kitchen room, which would then probably be
a more confined space than if it was open to the restaur-
ant area.
Every additional 10 h stay in the kitchen per week in-
creased the risk of having sputum in the past 30 days by
14%, sore throat by 13%, shortness of breath by 26%,
wheezing by 22% and having any one of these symptoms
by 16%. Those who fry 2–350 dishes per week had a
higher risk of “having any one symptom” than those who
did not fry any dishes (OR = 2.53) and those frying 351–
745 dishes per week had an even higher risk of wheezing
(OR = 5.19). Cooking every day at home increased the
risk of coughing (OR = 3.88, P < 0.01), having sputum
(OR = 4.60, P = 0.05) and having at least one symptom
(OR = 5.62, P < 0.01), while cooking some days at home
can predict only the risk of having a cold (OR = 4.71, P
= 0.05) and having any the symptoms (OR = 5.54, P <
0.01). TWC every day can predict all of the symptoms,
except shortness of breath, nasal irritation and having a
cold, while TWC some days only predicted the risk of
coughing, having sputum and sore throat. Again, type of
restaurant and having a ventilation hood failed to predict
any survey symptoms.
Discussion
Compared with the control group, restaurant workers
had a higher risk of dyspnea, stuffy nose, cough, wheeze,
phlegm and many of the survey symptoms in the past
30 days (Table 2). This finding is in line with a previous
study in Norway [17] and Nigeria [18]. Based on data
from 239 workers in 67 kitchens in Norway, Svendsen et
al. [17] found exposure to kitchen smoke to be associ-
ated with an increased risk of dyspnea (RR = 4.1; 95%CI
2.7, 6.3), severe dyspnea (RR = 2.9; 95%CI 1.5, 5.7) and
other health symptoms related to work (RR = 4.3; 95%CI
2.7, 6.7) among women employees. Among male em-
ployees, only dyspnea (RR = 1.8; 95%CI 1.4, 2.3) and
other health symptoms (RR = 4.3; 95%CI 2.7, 6.7) was
found to be significantly increase. A recent study in
Nigeria [18] also reported a significant increase in chest
tightness (OR = 3.1, P = 0.0.04), wheeze (OR = 1.2, P =
0.04) and nasal congestion (OR = 1.2, P = 0.02) among
certain types of restaurant worker in Nigeria. It is well
established that kitchen smoke contains thousands of
toxic chemicals and many of them are respiratory irri-
tants, including nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter,
acrolein and formaldehyde [1, 2]. Exposure to these

 pollutants is known to damage the respiratory tract and
cause the problematic respiratory symptoms [4, 5, 11].
We compared the respiratory symptoms of restaurant
workers from different cultures and working practices,
described in the literature, with the results from our.
Norway had a higher RR for dyspnea (4.1 vs 1.9 for our
study) and severe dyspnea (2.9 vs our RR of 1.4) among
women group, but lower RR of both symptom among
men group (Our study 3.1 vs Norwegian study 1.8 for
dyspnea; 1.4 vs 0.6 for severe dyspnea). The divergence
of RR mainly comes from the difference of the symptom
prevalence among the control groups of the two studies.
While the prevalence of dyspnea among the sample of
restaurant workers (52.3% in the Norwegian study vs
43.5% for our study) was comparable, the prevalence of
dyspnea in the control group in our study was much
higher than that in Norway (27.5% vs 10.6%). It is prob-
able that Thai women are likely to have a poorer health
background and greater exposure to other source of pol-
lution, such as ambient air pollution and kitchen smoke,
than women in Norway. Our result showed that 85.0%
of women in our control group reported cooking at
home (Table 1). The lower RR between the male groups
in the two surveys can be explained by an unusually high
rate of dyspnea (25.5%) and severe dyspnea (16.8%) in
Norway was explained as either employment in polluted
work areas, and/or selection bias [17]. In the comparison
between our study and the Nigerian study [18], the RR
of “wheeze” was 2.1 among women and 9.9 among men,
and for “stuffy nose” was 1.7 among women and 3.1
among men, with the Nigerian study showing the higher
rates. The OR was used in the Nigerian study for a par-
ticular type of restaurant worker (Mai suyas worker)
which resulted in the RR figures being higher than the
OR, which were 1.2 for both “wheeze” and “stuffy nose”
symptoms. Differences in background health, pollution
level and working practices might account for the
disparity.
This study also found many of the symptom in the
past 30 days to be associated with restaurant work.
Women restaurant workers reported a higher rate of
shortness of breath (RR = 2.1; 95%CI 1.0–4.4) and having
any one symptom (RR = 1.3, 95%CI 1.1, 1.6) (Table 2).
Among men, a significantly increased risk was found for
coughing, having a cold, sore throat, having sputum,
wheezing and having any one symptom. This result was
also seen in a recent study in Hong Kong [19], which re-
ported a higher prevalence of these symptoms, and OR,
of workers in a gas fueled kitchen compared to those in
electric kitchens. For coughing prevalence ratio between
restaurant workers and the control group was 11.2 vs
9.6 (OR = 1.1; 95%CI 0.5, 2.4), phlegm 16.5% vs 122%
(OR = 1.3; 95%CI 0.6, 2.6), runny nose 11.2% vs 11.3%
(OR = 1.1; 95%CI 0.5, 2.3) and sore throat 13.7% vs 6.1%
(OR = 2.3; 95%CI 1.0, 5.7). However, a higher rate and
RR for coughing, phlegm and sore throat, was found in
our study (see Table 2). The difference in cooking style,
work practices and work environment might be the
main source for the variance. Restaurants in Hong Kong
are likely to have higher working standards with more
modern equipment using cleaner fuels than those in
Thailand which are mainly small restaurants in rural
areas. In addition, this study employed the general pub-
lic as the control group whereas the previous studies
using workers in kitchen with electric cooking equip-
ment as the control.
When comparing women to men restaurant workers,
there was a difference in the prevalence and RR of re-
spiratory symptoms. Women had a higher prevalence of
“dyspnea” (52.3% of women vs 30.7% of men) and “se-
vere dyspnea” (11.4% women vs 6.7% men) but men had
more
“wheeze”
(38.7%
vs
25.5%
for
women)
and
“phlegm” (25.3% vs 14.4% for women) (Table 2). The ele-
vated levels among women of dyspnea and severe dys-
pnea, which are signs of chronic pulmonary disease, was
in line with previous findings of greater susceptibility to
COPD among women [23]: cooking at home might be
the source of this bias. The Norwegian study [17] also
showed a similar outcome. A higher rate of “wheeze”
and “phlegm” among men can be explained by higher
number of men smoking cigarettes (53.5% of men vs
3.2% of women). A higher RR among men for “dyspnea”
(1.9 for women vs 3.1 for men), “stuffy nose” (1.7 for
women vs 3.1 for men) and “wheeze” (2.1 for women vs
9.9 for men) came mainly from the low rate of the symp-
toms among the control group. For “cough”, the preva-
lence was similar for both women and men workers but
the RR was higher in the women workers due to a lower
rate among the members of the control group. Higher
cigarette consumption by the men might explain this
finding.
Several factors can predict chronic symptoms and
symptoms in the past 30 days. Duration of working can
predict the risk of most of chronic survey symptoms, a
similar finding to [18]. Every 10 additional hours per
week working in a kitchen area increases the risk of
“cough” by 15%, “wheeze” by 16%, having sputum in the
past 30 days by 14%, sore throat in the past 30 days by
13%, shortness of breath in the past 30 days by 26%,
wheezing in the past 30 days by 22% and having any one
symptoms in the past 30 days by 16%. It was also re-
ported in [17] that there was a 20% increase in dyspnea
and other symptoms in connection with work among
kitchen workers in Norway. The number of fried dishes
prepared per week can also predict most of the survey
symptoms and in a dose–response trend for “cough”,
“phlegm” and “wheeze” (Table 3). It was also found that,
compared with lard, using vegetable oil can predict risk

 of “stuffy nose” and having a cold in the past 30 days.
This results in line with recent study that suggested that
frying food with vegetable oil will release more aldehyde
and is therefore considered more harmful than frying
with lard [24]. Cooking at home can predict many symp-
toms, including “cough”, “wheeze”, “dyspnea”, “stuffy
nose”, coughing in the past 30 days, having sputum in
the past 30 days and having a cold in the past 30 days.
This could bias the result toward the null. This study
also confirmed the previous finding that “tears while
cooking” is a good indicator for smoke exposure [25].
TWC can predict most of the survey symptoms.
It was an unexpected result that working in an à la
carte restaurant which has more frying activity was not
associated with a rise in the prevalence of any of the
health symptoms as compared with working in the other
types of restaurant. This implies that working in the
other types of restaurants, which serve pre-prepared,
noodle and papaya salad, might also risk respiratory haz-
ards but from types of activities other than frying. As
well, workers involved with pre-prepared food might
also be involved in cooking during the food preparation
process. As the data showed, the 49 workers serving
pre-prepared food came from 31 restaurants and this
implied that the shop owner both cooked and served the
food by themselves. Workers in a noodle restaurant, al-
though not involve in frying activity, are often exposed
to fuel smoke and vapors from boiling soup which are
also harmful [7]. Papaya salad restaurant also often sell
grilled or fried meat, chicken, fish, or pork and might be
exposed to toxic smoke from broiling activity. Our study
showed that health outcomes were influenced not only
by frying activity but also other variables, such as cook-
ing method, fuel and oil use, type of kitchen and ventila-
tion
systems.
Future
research
should
employ
quantitative robot indicators such as fried dishes per
week, hours working in the kitchen, or TWC as an ex-
posure index.
Another unusual finding was that having a ventillation
hood did not lower risk of any symptoms and that hav-
ing separated kitchen room actually increased the risk of
“wheeze”, “stuffy nose” and having a cold in the past
30 days. The possible explanation of these two phenom-
ena is that having a separate kitchen room might limit
natural air ventilation and caused pollution to be accu-
mulated. It was also observed that installed ventilation
hoods were often not in use or were not well designed
and didn’t function in an effective way. Data on ventila-
tion hoods alone may not indicate better ventilation, and
more information on the use and efficiency of the venti-
lation system is also needed.
There were some limitations in this study. Information
on health symptoms was self-reported which could
introduce
information
bias.
However,
by
using
a
standard questionnaire and well-trained qualified staff,
the error should be minimized with no relevant differ-
ence in distribution between the study group and the
control group. If anything, this possible bias would
lower, not increase, the estimated risk. When asking
about symptoms in the past, recall bias might also occur
because concern and ability to remember the health
problems of study and control group may not be the
same for the participants in each group. However, by
asking about health symptoms in the immediate past
30 days, the problem was expected to be minimal. An-
other bias, the so called “healthy worker effect”, is ex-
pected in this type of occupational health study because,
normally, the study participants tend to be stronger than
the general population [26]. This can be explained by
the fact that those workers who become ill will be
forced, or will volunteer, to leave, leaving only healthy
individuals to be selected for study. This type of bias will
lead to underestimation of the impact.
Conclusions
This study is among a very few to investigate health
problems of restaurant workers arising from their work.
Compared
with
the
general
population,
restaurant
workers have a much higher prevalence of both chronic
and acute respiratory symptoms. A number of factors
were identified as predictive factors for a variety of
health problems, particularly respiratory problems. The
list of the factors includes job description, job period,
size of restaurant, kitchen location, cooking oil, hours of
stay in the kitchen area, frequency of fried dishes, fre-
quency of occurrence of TWC, and additional cooking
at home. It is suggested that more risk factors may well
be identified if further studies using a larger sample size,
under a greater variety of working environments, were
conducted. Generally, workplace health and safety mea-
sures providing greater health protection of restaurant
workers are urgently needed and the issue should receive
more public attention.
