In Brief
Mitalipov, Huang, and colleagues show
that human iPSCs derived from older
adults carry more mitochondrial DNA
mutations than those derived from
younger individuals. Defects in metabolic
function caused by mtDNA mutations
suggest careful screening of hiPSC
clones for mutational load before clinical
application.

SUMMARY
The genetic integrity of iPSCs is an important consid-
eration for therapeutic application. In this study, we
examine the accumulation of somatic mitochondrial
genome (mtDNA) mutations in skin fibroblasts,
blood, and iPSCs derived from young and elderly
subjects (24–72 years). We found that pooled skin
and blood mtDNA contained low heteroplasmic point
mutations, but a panel of ten individual iPSC lines
from each tissue or clonally expanded fibroblasts
carried an elevated load of heteroplasmic or homo-
plasmic mutations, suggesting that somatic muta-
tions randomly arise within individual cells but
are not detectable in whole tissues. The frequency
of mtDNA defects in iPSCs increased with age,
and many mutations were non-synonymous or
resided in RNA coding genes and thus can lead
to respiratory defects. Our results highlight a need
to monitor mtDNA mutations in iPSCs, especially
those generated from older patients, and to examine
the metabolic status of iPSCs destined for clinical
applications.
INTRODUCTION
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer an unlimited source
for autologous cell replacement therapies to treat age-associ-
ated degenerative diseases. Aging is generally characterized
by increased DNA damage and genomic instability (Garinis
et al., 2008; Lombard et al., 2005); thus, iPSCs derived from
elderly subjects may harbor point mutations and larger genomic
rearrangements. Indeed, iPSCs display increased chromosome
aberrations (Mayshar et al., 2010), subchromosomal copy num-
ber variations (CNVs) (Abyzov et al., 2012; Laurent et al., 2011),
and exome mutations (Johannesson et al., 2014), compared to
natural embryonic stem cell (ESC) counterparts (Ma et al., 2014).
The rate of mtDNA mutations is believed to be at least 10- to
20-fold higher than that observed in the nuclear genome (Wal-
lace, 1994), and often both mutated and wild-type mtDNA (het-
eroplasmy) can coexist in the same cell (Rossignol et al.,
2003). Large deletions are most frequently observed mtDNA ab-
normalities in aged post-mitotic tissues such as brain, heart, and
muscle (Bender et al., 2006; Bua et al., 2006; Corral-Debrinski
et al., 1992; Cortopassi et al., 1992; Mohamed et al., 2006) and
have been implicated in aging and diseases such as Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral scle-
rosis (ALS), and diabetes (Larsson, 2010; Lin and Beal, 2006; Pe-
tersen et al., 2003; Wallace, 2005). In addition, mtDNA point mu-
tations were reported in some tumors and replicating tissues
(Chatterjee et al., 2006; Ju et al., 2014; Michikawa et al., 1999;
Taylor et al., 2003). However, the extent of mtDNA defects in
proliferating peripheral tissues commonly used for iPSC induc-
tion, such as skin and blood, is thought to be low and limited
to common non-coding variants (Schon et al., 2012; Yao et al.,
2015). Accumulation of mtDNA variants in these tissues with
age was insignificant (Greaves et al., 2010; Hashizume et al.,
2015). Several point mutations were identified in iPSCs gener-
ated from the newborn foreskin fibroblasts, although most of
these variants were non-coding, common for the general popu-
lation, and did not affect their metabolic activity (Prigione et al.,
2011). Somatic mtDNA mutations may be under-reported sec-
ondary to the level of sample interrogation. Here, we describe

 the accumulation of somatic mtDNA mutations revealed in
multiple skin and blood iPSCs derived from 14 adult subjects
as a function of age through whole mtDNA next-generation
sequencing (NGS) (Table S1).
RESULTS
mtDNA Mutations in Skin Fibroblasts and iPSCs from
Elderly Subjects
First, we recruited a 72-year-old (A) subject and carried out Illu-
mina MiSeq-based mtDNA sequencing of pooled fibroblasts
(PF) isolated from a skin biopsy containing approximately 1
million cells (Ma et al., 2015). After selecting variants with
R2% heteroplasmy levels, 11 point mutations were identified,
with only 2 variants reaching the 15% minimum threshold asso-
ciated with pathogenic effects (17% in the D-loop and 19% in the
ND5 gene) (Rossignol et al., 2003; Wallace, 1986), and the re-
maining were present at low levels (2%–8%) (Figure 1A). We
reasoned that, if somatic mtDNA mutations arise randomly in in-
dividual cells, each fibroblast may harbor a unique mutation not
shared with other cells (Figure S1A). Indeed, when skin fibro-
blasts were subcloned and ten randomly selected cloned fibro-
blasts (CF) were separately analyzed, a total of 34 mutations
were detected in these ten cells, 14 of which were above 15%
heteroplasmy, including 6 that were over 80% (Figures 1B and
1C; Table S2). Mutations and their heteroplasmy levels remained
unchanged during extended fibroblast culture (from passage [p.]
2 to p. 15), indicating an in vivo origin of most mtDNA defects
(Figure S1B).
To further investigate the impact of this heterogeneity, multiple
iPSC lines were generated from same fibroblasts (FiPSCs), and
mutation loads were analyzed in ten randomly selected, early-
passage (p. 2–4) FiPSCs. A total of 28 mutations was discovered
in these ten individual cell lines. Moreover, four of these muta-
tions were homoplasmic (100% mutant), and nine were hetero-
plasmic at high (>15%) levels (Figures 1D and 1E; Table S3).
Each individual FiPSC line harbored at least one mutation, while
iPS-8 contained 12 mutations. The average mutation number per
cell (4.5) was comparable to that of CF (4.7) but significantly
higher than that in PF (1.1 3 10�5) (Figure 1F). Surprisingly,
only four mutations in FiPSCs were shared with parental fibro-
blasts, while the remaining variants were novel. These variants

 were likely present, but at undetectable levels, in PF (Figure 1G).
Among shared variants, mt14002A > G in ND5 was measured at
19% in PF versus 93% in iPS-1 (ND5-5). Similarly, 2% hetero-
plasmy at the mt13369T > C position in PF increased to 50%
in iPS-5 (ND5-3) (Figures 1A and 1D). Nine mutations were
shared between two or more individual FiPSC lines but varied
in heteroplasmy levels, while the remaining variants were unique
and found only in one cell line (Tables S2 and S3).
We validated all variants with a heteroplasmy level R15% by
Sanger sequencing or restriction fragment length polymorphism
(RFLP) (Figures S1C and S1D). In addition, we selected a panel of
low-heteroplasmy variants and verified by TA cloning and multi-
ple-clone sequencing by PCR (Figure S1E). Since some variants
may not be detectable by NGS in PF, we performed more sensi-
tive
allele-refractory-mutation-system-based
qPCR
(ARMS-
qPCR) analysis and confirmed the presence of iPSC mutations
(mt5823A > G and mt12188T > C) in parental fibroblasts at
very low levels (Figure S1F).
To investigate whether somatic mtDNA mutations were also
common for other elderly subjects, four more participants were
sampled. PF from another 72-year-old (B) subject showed 16
mutations, most of which were at low heteroplasmy. Ten individ-
ually sequenced FiPSC lines carried a total of nine mutations,

eight of which were not detected in
parental fibroblasts (Figures 2A and 2B;
Table S3). Interestingly, the high-hetero-
plasmy mt13477G > A variant (28%) in
PF was not transmitted to FiPSC lines,
possibly due to negative selection for plu-
ripotency. Nine FiPSC lines shared three
novel homoplasmic mutations (mt596T >
C in tRNA, mt4719T > C in ND2, and
mt12651G > A in ND5) (Figure 2C; Table
S3). PF from a 67-year-old (A) subject contained a total of four
low-heteroplasmy mutations, while ten randomly sequenced
FiPSC lines carried 11 mutations, 10 of which were novel. Only
one variant was high, with 36% heteroplasmy, while other FiPSC
variants were between 4% and 12% heteroplasmy (Figure S2A;
Table S3). Another 67-year-old (B) subject showed a mutation
profile similar to that seen for other elderly subjects: screening
of PF detected nine low-heteroplasmy mutations, while a total
of 27 mtDNA mutations were found in ten FiPSC lines (Figures
S2B and S2C). One FiPSC line carried no detectable mutations,
but the remaining nine showed high heteroplasmy mutations
(Figure S2D). One of these mutations (mt2846G > A in the 16S
gene) was homoplasmic, and 11 were at high heteroplasmy
(>15%) (Table S3).
PF from a 60-year-old subject carried ten mutations, most
at low heteroplasmy, while nine individually sequenced CF
harbored 11 mutations, five of which were homoplasmic (Fig-
ure S2E; Table S2). Ten FiPSC lines carried a total of 11 hetero-
plasmic or homoplasmic mutations, 3 of which were shared with
PF (Figures S2F and S2G). Among them, mt3005A > C substitu-
tion (41%) in the 16S gene in PF was homoplasmic in two individ-
ual FiPSC lines and remained at 47% heteroplasmy in another
(Table S3).

 These results suggest that unique somatic mtDNA mutations
randomly arise in individual fibroblasts within the skin tissue of
elderly subjects, which may not be detectable in whole-tissue
DNA extracts. These diverse mtDNA mutations may become
‘‘captured’’ in individual CF or FiPSCs representing the progeny
of a single fibroblast. Many mutations are homoplasmic or at
high heteroplasmy and could result in mitochondrial dysfunction.
mtDNA Mutations in Blood-Derived iPSCs from Elderly
Subjects
Next, we asked whether mtDNA mutations in elderly subjects are
confined to skin fibroblasts or whether they occur in other tis-
sues. In addition to fibroblasts, iPSCs can be routinely derived
from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs
have a relatively short lifespan and are continuously regenerated
from a stem cell pool. Unlike skin fibroblasts, iPSC induction
from blood does not require in vitro cell expansion, thus elimi-
nating the risk of in-vitro-induced mutations. Therefore, we
collected a blood sample from the 72-year-old (B) subject and
generated a panel of ten PBMC iPSC (BiPSC) lines. Analysis of
whole blood revealed only six low-heteroplasmy mutations,
while 21 mutations were detected in the BiPSC lines. All but
four mutations were novel, and 15/21 (71%) mutations were
over 15% heteroplasmy, including four that were over 80% (Fig-
ures 2D and 2E). Each BiPSC line contained at least one high het-
eroplasmic variant, and seven mutations were shared between
two or more individual cell lines (Figure 2F; Table S4). These re-
sults were similar to those seen in FiPSCs from this subject and
comparable to mutations reported in vivo in individual hemato-
poietic stem cells (Yao et al., 2015).
Two low heteroplasmic variants in whole blood and ten muta-
tions in a panel of BiPSC lines were identified from the 67-year-
old (B) subject (Figure S3A). Both whole-blood mutations were
present in several BiPSC lines but at higher heteroplasmic or ho-
moplasmic levels (Table S4). Among BiPSC lines, four carried
high heteroplasmic mutations, while three cell lines had no
detectable mutations (Figure S3B). In general, mtDNA mutation
profiles in blood and BiPSCs were comparable to skin fibroblasts
from this subject, although the latter contained fewer mutations.
We also examined blood and BiPSC mutations from a 66-year-
old subject. Only one mutation was detected in whole blood,
but ten BiPSC lines carried a total of 19 mutations, including
four high heteroplasmic variants (>80%) (Figure S3C). A hetero-
plasmic (18%) mutation in ND4 (mt11608A > G) in whole blood
was present in four individual iPSC lines: homoplasmic in three
cell lines and 48% in the fourth. This mutation also was found
in PF from this subject at 52% heteroplasmy (Figure S3D; Table
S4). Only one BiPSC line had no detectable mutations, while
seven lines contained at least one variant with over 15% hetero-
plasmy (Figure S3E).
In summary, similar to FiPSC, individual BiPSC lines display
unique mtDNA mutations not detected in whole blood. Thus,
the accumulation of mutations in individual cells appears to be
a common phenomenon in both skin and blood cell types in
elderly subjects.
mtDNA Mutations in Young Subjects
To determine whether mtDNA mutations are also present in
younger individuals, we generated a panel of ten FiPSCs from
each of five young subjects, ranging between 27 and 50 years
of age (www.who.int/healthinfo/en/). Two low heteroplasmic
mutations were detected in PF from a 50-year-old subject, but
only a single heteroplasmic mutation was found in one FiPSC
line, while the remaining nine lines were unaffected (Table S3).
PF from a 33-year-old subject contained two low heteroplasmic
variants, but FiPSCs carried six mutations (Figure 3A). A non-
synonymous mt8427T > C mutation (3%) in ATP8 in PF was
transmitted to several FiPSC lines at homoplasmic or high heter-
oplasmy levels. This mutation was also found in the whole blood
(Figures 3B and 3C; Table S3). PF from a 28-year-old subject
carried four mutations, including two high heteroplasmy levels
in the ribosomal 12S gene (45% and 43%) (Figure S4A). Six
out of eight examined CF carried the homoplasmic mutation in
16S gene (mt2487A > C) (Table S2). The two high variants in
PF were also present in every FiPSC line at higher heteroplasmy
or homoplasmic levels but not in CF, suggesting possible posi-
tive selection in FiPSC (Figure S4B; Tables S2 and S3). Three
additional heteroplasmic mutations in FiPSCs affected 16S,
ND2, and COI genes. Finally, three low heteroplasmic variants
in PF, but five mutations in ten FiPSC lines, were identified
from another 27-year-old subject (Figure S4C). Two PF muta-
tions were carried to FiPSCs, but one reached 91% hetero-
plasmy (Table S3). PF from a 24-year-old subject contained
only two low heteroplasmic variants. However, nine mutations
were detected in a panel of ten FiPSC lines, including three ho-
moplasmic variants (Figures S4D and S4E; Table S3).
In summary, the spectrum of mtDNA mutations detected in PF
and in FiPSC lines from younger subjects was similar to that of an
elderly group. Thus, FiPSC carried more mutations per cell at
higher heteroplasmy loads than did parental PF (Figure 3D).
However, the average number of mutations per cell detected in
PF or FiPSC from the younger subjects was significantly lower
than in the elderly group (Figures 3E and S4F). These results
imply that mtDNA abnormalities gradually accumulate with aging
and could adversely affect iPSC quality.
Origin of mtDNA Mutations
As indicated earlier, some heteroplasmic variants were present
in both PF and whole blood, suggesting a common origin from
the progenitor tissue or the germline (Chinnery and Turnbull,
2000). We analyzed PF and whole-blood samples collected
from the ten subjects. Of the total of 58 heteroplasmic mutations
identified in PF and 18 in blood, only ten (13%) variants were pre-
sent in both these tissues (Table 1). Thus, only a small portion of
the variants originated during early development, while most mu-
tations occurred later. To investigate the germline origin of these
common mtDNA variants, we first compared mutations from the
60-year-old subject and her 31-year-old daughter. A total of ten
mutations in both PF and blood were discovered in the mother,
but only three mutations were found in her daughter’s tissues
(Table 1, footnote a; Table S3). No common variants were iden-
tified between mother and daughter, suggesting that all muta-
tions were of somatic origin.
To gain further insights into germline versus somatic origin of
mtDNA variants, we collected mature oocytes from five young
women and generated 14 ESCs following in vitro fertilization
(IVF). Mutations in individual ESC lines were compared to PF,
blood, and a panel of FiPSCs from the same subjects. A total
628
Cell Stem Cell 18, 625–636, May 5, 2016
 of ten mutations were found in 14 ESC lines, with only one variant
in 16S gene (5%), while the remaining mutations were in the non-
coding D-loop area. In contrast, seven variants from a total of 13
mutations identified in PF and/or blood samples from these
women were located in coding regions (Table 2). Interestingly,
all D-loop mutations in ESCs were within known neutral SNPs
differentiating human haplotypes. One of these variants in
ES11 (mt16448C > T) was homoplasmic, while other variants
were heteroplasmic (Table S3). Five D-loop mutations in ESCs
were also seen in the corresponding PF or blood samples from
the same subjects, suggesting that these mutations were germ-
line (Table 2). When ESCs were compared to a panel of isogenic
FiPSCs in three women, five variants were found in nine ESC
lines, while a total of 16 variants were identified in 30 iPSC lines.
In contrast to non-coding mutations seen in ESCs, most iPSC
variants (14/16) were non-synonymous or affected rRNA and
tRNA genes (Table S5). In summary, germline mtDNA variants
in ESCs reside within the non-coding D-loop, while iPSC variants
are located in coding genes, suggesting a somatic origin of most
mtDNA mutations in adults (Greaves et al., 2014; He et al., 2010;
Payne et al., 2013).
Given that most or all iPSCs in elderly subjects can be affected
by somatic mtDNA mutations, we generated isogenic nuclear
transfer (NT)-ESCs carrying donor germline mtDNA, using so-
matic cell NT (SCNT) (Tachibana et al., 2013). SCNT offers an
alternative reprogramming strategy for generating NT-ESCs
while simultaneously replacing somatic mtDNA with oocyte
mitochondria. We collected oocytes from the 25-year-old and
27-year-old subjects whose ESCs were not affected (Table 2)
and used them for SCNT with fibroblasts from the 72-year-old
(A) subject (Table S6). The efficiency of embryo development
and ESC isolation was comparable to a previous study with fetal

 and newborn fibroblasts, suggesting that reprogramming is un-
affected by somatic cell aging and disease (Tachibana et al.,
2013). Donor mtDNA in two NT lines differed from the original
subject haplotype (X2c) in 39 (U5a) and 40 (D4a) SNPs (Table
S7). As expected, no mtDNA mutations were detected in NT lines
(Table S3).
Transmission and Functional Implications of Somatic
mtDNA Mutations in iPSCs
Next, we analyzed the transmission pattern of somatic mutations
to iPSC to define possible positive or negative selection for plu-
ripotency. A total of 112 mutations were detected in PF, CF, or
blood from 11 subjects, 69% (77/112) of whom were coding
(non-synonymous or in RNA genes) (Figure 4A). The majority of
parental variants (73/112, 65%) were not found in iPSCs, while
remaining mutations were transmitted to at least one cell line.
The majority of transmitted (50/73, 68%) and non-transmitted
(27/39, 69%) somatic mtDNA variants were represented by cod-
ing mutations, suggesting that iPSC induction is not affected by
the pathogenicity of mtDNA defects. In addition, among 123
unique iPSC variants, 79% (97/123) were also coding mutations
in protein or RNA genes. The spectrum of coding mutations in
130 iPSC lines included both rRNA and 11 out of 13 protein
genes, with the exception of ND3 and ND4L (Figure 4A). In addi-
tion, no mutations were found in 14 out of a total of 22 tRNA
genes, suggesting possible deleterious effects of these muta-
tions for pluripotency.
Among a total of 162 variants, 112 mutations were identified in
FiPSCs (n = 100), with the remaining 50 identified in BiPSCs (n =
30) (Figure S5A). Eighty (49%) variants were above the minimum
15% threshold associated with a functional impact on a cell’s
ability to supply energy (Rossignol et al., 2003). Among these,
41% (33/80) were non-synonymous substitutions or in/del in
coding regions of mtDNA proteins, resulting in a change of amino
acid coding. Another 33% (27/80) were in tRNA or rRNA genes
that likely affect protein synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) (Figure 4B). Comparisons of these variants to a data-
base containing full mtDNA sequences for 26,850 subjects re-
vealed that 56% of the variants were never reported, while the
remaining 33% were seen in less than 1% of the general human
population (Figure 4C). Moreover, 90% of the mutations were
never reported for the corresponding haplotypes (Figure 4D).
Interestingly, none of the most common mtDNA mutations impli-
cated in inherited human disease were seen in our study (http://
www.mitomap.org/MITOMAP). Screening revealed that only five
mutations were previously linked to human disease (Figure S5B)
(Fauser et al., 2002; Horva
´ th et al., 2009; Petros et al., 2005; Pra-
sad et al., 2006; Yan et al., 2011).
Selected iPSCs, along with unaffected control ESCs, were
differentiated to fibroblasts to activate oxidative metabolism
(Folmes et al., 2012) and were FACS (fluorescence-activated
cell sorting) sorted for the CD13 marker to isolate homogeneous
populations. We confirmed that FiPSC mutations and their
heteroplasmy were maintained upon their extended culture
and subsequent differentiation to fibroblasts in most samples
(Table S8). Of note, heteroplasmy levels in iPSc-2 increased
during culture, possibly due to bottleneck and genetic drift.
No new mutations arose during extended iPSC culture or
differentiation, with the exception of one 15326G > A variant

 the 72-year-old (A) iPSa-5 carrying a homoplasmic tRNA and two
heteroplasmic ND5 mutations and iPSa-10 with a total of seven
low heteroplasmic mutations affecting multiple genes demon-
strated significantly lower (p < 0.05) COMI activity, compared
to that of controls or unaffected iPSa-9 (Figure S6A). In the
72-year-old (B), iPSb-7 with three homoplasmic mutations in
tRNA, ND2, and ND5 was also affected, compared to ESCs or
to iPSb-8 carrying 12S homoplasmy mutations (Figure S6B).
These results were corroborated and extended with measure-
ments of mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates (OCR) for
respiration and energy production capacity (Ma et al., 2015).
As expected, mutant FiPSCs demonstrated reduced OCR com-
pared to those of mutation-free cells (p < 0.01) (Figure 5A).
Among affected cells, iPSc-2 with mutations in 12S, tRNA,
COII plus ATP8, and iPSb-8 with one mutation in 12S displayed
lower OCR than iPSd-9 carrying mutations in COI and 16S genes
(p < 0.01; Figure S6C).
Furthermore, the mutant 72-year-old (A) iPSa-5 and -10 ex-
hibited significantly lower OCR (p < 0.05) when compared to
parental PF (p < 0.05; Figure 5B; Figure S6D). Moreover, both
FiPSC lines and PF displayed significantly lower OCR in respira-
tion, ATP turnover, and reserve capacity when compared to
genetically rescued NT2.
In summary, these results demonstrate that specific homo-
plasmic or high heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations result in dimin-
ished metabolic function in iPSCs. Moreover, mitochondrial ca-
pacity was also affected in iPSCs carrying low heteroplasmy but
multiple mutations, likely due to the cumulative effects of several
mtDNA defects. In contrast, mtDNA replacement in affected pa-
tient cells with donor oocyte mitochondria restored normal meta-
bolic function.
DISCUSSION
Gradual loss of mitochondrial function is implicated in normal ag-
ing and in the etiology of many age-onset degenerative diseases.
In particular, somatic mtDNA mutations with an associated
decline in OXPHOS activity may play a central role in the aging
process (Schon et al., 2012). While current evidence suggests
that mtDNA mutations increase in frequency in a variety of
aged human tissues, leading to a pathogenic loss of respiratory
capacity (Yu and Bennett, 2014), the extent and role of detect-
able high-level heteroplasmic or homoplasmic mtDNA mutations
remains uncertain (Schon et al., 2012). The 4,977-bp deletion is
the most frequently observed mtDNA mutation in post-mitotic
tissues during both normal aging and neurodegeneration (Meiss-
ner et al., 2008). Deletions have also been found in skin tissues,
but typically at very low heteroplasmy levels (Eshaghian et al.,
2006). The present study implicates extensive loss of mitochon-
drial genome integrity in skin fibroblasts and blood cells as a
function of age. Due to heterogeneity, somatic mtDNA mutations
evade conventional detection in pooled cells. Thus, accurate
assessment of mtDNA defects by single-cell analysis revealed
novel homoplasmic or high-level heteroplasmic mtDNA muta-
tions not detected in parental tissues. Our observations also
suggest that point mutations are more prevalent in both skin
and blood cells.
The mutation frequency in mtDNA observed in adult iPSCs in
this study is significantly higher, compared to nuclear genome
abnormalities (Johannesson et al., 2014). While the evidence
suggests that most of these variants are transmitted from
parental skin or blood cells, we cannot exclude positive selection
of mtDNA mutations during iPSC induction or extended culture.

Mutations in 14 ESC lines were derived from five egg donors and comparison to blood and skin fibroblast variants. A total of ten mutations were un-
covered in ESCs; all but one of these variants were located in the non-coding D-loop area. Note that five ESC mutations were also found in blood or skin
fibroblasts of egg donors, suggesting a germline nature for these variants. n/t, non-tested; n/a, non-applicable. See also Tables S3, S5, S6, and S7.

 We also demonstrate an increase in mtDNA damage in aged
individuals compared to younger participants. Comparative an-
alyses between skin and blood mutations from the same individ-
uals suggest that most mutations arise randomly with age in in-
dividual tissues and cells. A small portion of shared mutations
indicate their common origin during early development.
Our study shows that mitochondrial genome integrity in indi-
vidual iPSC lines, particularly from elderly subjects, can be
compromised due to cell of origin. Structural damages to the
mtDNA genes in iPSCs will likely diminish their metabolic func-
tion in energy demanding differentiated cells and, thereby, limit
their therapeutic potential and may also affect applications in
disease modeling or pharmacological screening. Therefore, it
is imperative to produce and screen multiple iPSC lines for chro-
mosomal, nuclear gene, and mtDNA defects and to identify
optimal tissues for iPSC induction. Harnessing youthful donor
mtDNA by SCNT mitigates the risk of carrying somatic mutations
into resultant pluripotent derivatives.

(A) A total of 112 mtDNA mutations were discovered in parental cells (PF, CF, and blood) from 11 subjects. Of these, 39 variants (35%) were found in corresponding
130 iPSC lines. Among non-transmitted, transmitted, and novel mutations in iPSCs, comparable percentages of variants (68%, 69%, and 79%, respectively) were
coding mutations in protein, rRNA, or tRNA genes. This suggests that most pathogenic mutations do not affect iPSC induction. However, certain coding mutations

 Skin Fibroblast Isolation
A skin biopsy (3-mm diameter) was obtained from the shoulder (upper arm) or
from inside the thigh, dissected into small pieces, incubated in 0.1% collage-
nase (type IV) for 30 min, and plated into 75-mm flasks containing DMEM/
F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10%
knockout serum replacement (KSR), and 4 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF).
PBMC Isolation from Whole Blood
7 ml blood was collected into EDTA-containing tubes from 11 subjects.
Approximately 3 ml was directly used for mtDNA extraction, and 4 ml was
used for PBMC isolation using Lymphoprep and SepMate (STEMCELL Tech-
nologies), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, blood was diluted
with an equal volume of PBS + 2% FBS and centrifuged in density gradient me-
dium in 15-ml tubes at 1,200 3 g for 15 min at room temperature. The white
buffy coat layer (middle) in the tubes containing PBMCs was isolated and
stored in liquid N2 until use.
Generation of iPSCs
Fibroblasts were transduced with a CytoTune-iPS Reprogramming Kit (Life
Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 1 or 2 days
before transduction, 1 3 106 cells (p. 3–p. 5) per well were plated in six-well
culture dishes containing DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS. The cells were then
transduced (at a multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 5) with reprogramming vec-
tors diluted with 1 ml medium per well. One week after transduction, cells
were re-plated onto 100-mm dishes containing feeder layers of mitomycin-
C-inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mEFs). More than 100 visible
FiPSC colonies appeared 3–4 weeks after transduction, and ten colonies
were randomly picked and manually propagated as previously described
(Ma et al., 2014) in knockout DMEM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with
20% KSR, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 1 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM
b-mercaptoethanol, penicillin-streptomycin, and 4 ng/ml bFGF (ES medium).
PBMC iPSCs were generated using the CytoTune-iPS Reprogramming Kit
with StemPro-34 medium (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Frozen PBMCs (2 3 106) were thawed and transduced with 5 MOI of
reprogramming vectors in 0.6 ml StemPro-34 medium. Three days after trans-
duction, PBMCs were re-plated onto mEF-containing, six-well dishes in ESC
medium, and BiPSC colonies were identified 3–4 weeks after induction. Ten
individual BiPSC clones were randomly picked among 30–40 colonies per sub-
ject and cultured under standard iPSC culture conditions.
Generation of SCNT Embryos
SCNT was performed as previously described (Tachibana et al., 2013). Skin fi-
broblasts from the 72-year-old (A) subject were synchronized at the G0/G1
stage of the cell cycle. Mature oocytes were retrieved following ovarian stim-
ulations, enucleated, and fused with fibroblasts. Following artificial activation,
SCNT embryos were cultured to blastocysts and used for ESC isolation.
Establishment of ESCs
Blastocysts developed following fertilization by intracytoplasmic sperm injec-
tion (ICSI) or SCNT were transferred onto plates containing mEFs and cultured
for 5–7 days at 37�C with 3% CO2, 5% O2, and 92% N2 in ESC derivation me-
dium (DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS and 10% KSR), as previously described (Ta-
chibana et al., 2013). Attached blastocyst outgrowths were manually minced
into small pieces and re-plated onto fresh plates, and ESC colonies were
selected for further propagation and analysis.
mtDNA Sequencing by MiSeq
DNA was extracted from skin fibroblasts, whole blood, or early-passage (p. 2–
p.4) iPSCs, using the Gentra DNA Extraction Kit (QIAGEN). Entire mtDNA was

 amplified by single PCR reaction, as previously described (Ma et al., 2015) using
the following primers: F-2120 GGACACTAGGAAAAAACCTTGTAGAGAGAG
and R-2119 AAAGAGCTGTTCCTCTTTGGACTAACA. These primers specif-
ically recognize genuine mtDNA but not nuclear mitochondrial pseudo-genes.
PCR conditions were: 94�C for 1 min, then 98�C for 10 s, and 68�C for
16 min, 30 cycles, and then 72�C for 10 min (TaKaRa LA Taq, Catalog No.
RR02AG). Concentration of PCR products was measured by the Qubit 2.0 Fluo-
rometer (Invitrogen). The DNA was used for library preparation with the Nextera
XT DNA Kit (Illumina). Sequencing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq plat-
form (DNA Core Facility, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center), and
the data were analyzed using NextGENe software. Briefly, sequence reads
ranging from 100 to 200 bp were quality filtered and processed using NextGENe
software and an algorithm similar to BLAT. The sequence error correction
feature (condensation) was performed to reduce false-positive variants and
produce sample consensus sequence and variant calls. Alignment without
sequence condensation was used to calculate the percentage of the mitochon-
drial genome with a depth of coverage of 1,000. Starting from quality FASTQ
reads, the reads were quality filtered and converted to FASTA format. Filtered
reads were then aligned to the human mitochondrial sequence reference
NC_012920.1, followed by variant calling. Variant heteroplasmy was calculated
by NextGENe software as follows. Base heteroplasmy (mutant allele frequency
%) = mutant allele (forward + reverse)/total coverage of all alleles C, G, T, and A
(forward + reverse) , 100. The clinical significance of the variants was analyzed
with MitoMaster (http://www.mitomap.org/MITOMASTER/WebHome) (Tang
and Huang, 2010).
Validation of mtDNA Mutations by Sanger Sequencing
mtDNA mutations sites over 15% heteroplasmy were validated independently
by Sanger sequencing. Regions of mtDNA containing MiSeq mutations were
amplified by PCR with previously reported primer sets (Eshaghian et al.,
2006), using the PCR Platinum SuperMix High Fidelity Kit (Life Technologies).
PCR products were purified, sequenced, and analyzed by Sequencher v. 5.0
(Gene Codes).
RFLP
Unique restriction digestion sites were identified at putative mutation posi-
tions, and DNA fragments were digested with selected enzymes. Samples
were analyzed on 1% agarose gels.
ARMS-qPCR
The ARMS-qPCR assay was performed to detect selected mtDNA mutations
at low-heteroplasmy levels, as previously described (Lee et al., 2012). The
TaqMan MGB probes in the following text were designed for mt5823A > G
and mt12188T > C mutations:

Molecular Subcloning
Subcloning of PCR fragments followed by sequence analysis of multiple
(28–33) individual clones was carried out to corroborate mtDNA mutations un-
covered by MiSeq. PCR primers were designed for selected mtDNA regions
containing mutations, and PCR products were subcloned using the TOPO
Cloning Kit (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Colonies were randomly selected, sequenced, and analyzed by Sequencher
v.5.0 (GeneCodes).
Assessment of Mitochondrial Respiratory Function
Early-passage (7–12) iPSCs were induced to differentiate by plating into
75-mm flasks without feeder in fibroblast medium and culturing for 2 weeks.
Differentiated cells were enriched for fibroblasts by FACS sorting for CD13-
positive cells (Paull et al., 2013). Mitochondrial COMI activity was measured
by spectrophotometry, as previously described (Spinazzi et al., 2012). Briefly,
intact mitochondria were isolated from fibroblasts and treated with and
without 3 mM rotenone at 340 nm wavelength for 5 min. Differences of absor-
bance per minute were obtained, and the specificity of COMI activity was esti-
mated by the percentage of rotenone inhibition.
Mitochondrial respiratory function was measured using the XF Cell Mito
Stress Test Kit in an XF24 Extracelluar Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences),
as previously described (Folmes et al., 2013). Mitochondrial OCR were
measured by serial addition of oligomycin (0.5 mg/ml) for ATP production (oli-
gomycin OCR � basal OCR), carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhy-
drazone (FCCP; 1 mM) for maximal respiration and reserve capacity (maximal
OCR � basal OCR), and Antimycin A (1 mM) and rotenone (0.5 mM) for non-
mitochondrial oxygen utilization. The value was normalized to baseline oxygen
consumption and total protein was quantified using a Bradford assay (Bio-
Rad; www.biorad.com). The experiments and data assessment were blinded
in an independent lab.
Statistical Analysis
The data were presented as means ± SD or SEM. p < 0.05 was considered sig-
nificant. Independent-group t tests for pairwise comparison or ANOVAs with
Tukey analysis for multiple comparisons were used (IBM SPSS).
