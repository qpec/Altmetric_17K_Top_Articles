Abstract
Background: Uptake of cervical cancer screening in the United Kingdom (UK) is
falling year on year, and a more sophisticated understanding of non-participation may help
design interventions to reverse this trend. This study ascertained the prevalence of different
non-participant types using the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM).
Methods: Home-based computer-assisted interviews were carried out with 3113 screening-
eligible women in Britain. Survey items assessed self-reported screening uptake and intention
to attend in future. Responses to these items were used to classify women into one of five
different types of non-participants.
Results: Of 793 non-participants, 28% were unaware of screening, 15% had decided not to
attend and 51% were intending to have screening but were currently overdue. Younger women
were more likely to be unaware of screening or to intend to be screened, while older women
were more likely to have decided not to be screened. Women from ethnic minority back-
grounds were more likely to be unaware of screening than white women. Being in a lower so-
cial grade was associated with increased odds of all three types of non-participation.

 Conclusion: The majority of cervical cancer screening non-participants are not making an
active decision not to attend but rather are either unaware or unable to act. There are clear
sociodemographic differences between non-participant types, which could be used to identify
where tailored interventions may be best targeted.

1. Introduction
Cancer screening offers the opportunity to detect
asymptomatic cancer or precancer (e.g. dysplasia or
polyps) in those who appear and feel healthy. This can
improve treatment outcomes and reduce morbidity and
mortality [1]. Many European countries have organised
screening programmes, which use population-based
registers to ensure all eligible adults are invited for
screening [2]. In the United Kingdom (UK), there are
nationally organised screening programmes for breast,
cervical and colorectal cancer, and these are estimated to
save thousands of lives a year [3e5]. Despite their
overall success, uptake of all three programmes is
considered suboptimal [6e8]. In addition there are
sociodemographic inequalities in attendance [8e10].
Improving access to screening and reducing inequalities
are high on the cancer agenda [11].
A recent review of interventions in the context of
organised programmes [12] found that cancer screening
uptake could be increased by offering reminders, practi-
tioner endorsement on the invitation or using alternative
tests (e.g. human papillomavirus (HPV) testing). There
was some evidence for using prescreening reminders,
preset appointments, offering evening and weekend
appointment times, mass media campaigns and direct
contact with a health professional. However, in most
cases room for improvement in attendance remains. An
alternative approach to intervention design is to move
away from using one-size-fits all interventions and
consider how some interventions may be more effective
for some groups than others, e.g. particular sociodemo-
graphic groups [13] or people with a certain screening
history [14,15]. While there are certainly interventions
that may be effective at improving uptake for all groups,
such as offering HPV self-testing for cervical cancer
screening [16,17], or face-to-face patient counselling for
colorectal cancer screening [18], these may realistically be
reserved for subgroups for which cheaper alternatives do
not work.
Behavioural science can be used to better understand
different types of decision-making for behaviours like
participation or non-participation in cancer screening
programmes. For example, an individual may never have
been screened or may have been screened but not as
recommended. Within both of these groups, motivations
may also differ; individuals may be unaware they should
be screened, be actively avoiding screening or be consid-
ering or preparing to be screened. One behavioural sci-
ence model that lends itself to understanding screening
non-participation is the Precaution Adoption Process
Model (PAPM) [19]. The PAPM suggests people move
through a series of stages towards participating in cancer
screening (see Fig. 1). It highlights the role of past
behaviour and differentiates between motives for non-
attendance including informed decisions not to partici-
pate. It also acknowledges the importance of translating
intention into action. This model has been used in the
context of colorectal cancer screening in the United States
of America (USA) [20e22].
The PAPM could be used to target appropriate in-
terventions
towards
specific
groups.
Targeting
in-
terventions
is
more
effective
than
using
a
single
intervention for everyone without consideration of what
a particular population needs. Using the PAPM to
explore screening non-participation would help refine
our understanding of screening non-participants, indi-
cating which non-participant groups are the largest and
where resources to improve participation are best
placed. Identifying sociodemographic correlates of each
non-participant type would indicate potential channels
and content for targeted interventions. To our knowl-
edge no one has used the PAPM to understand non-
participation in an organised screening programme.
While this approach could be useful for all types of
cancer screening, we have chosen to focus on cervical
cancer
screening
non-participants.
Breast
screening
coverage in England has improved over the last 10�years
[7] and colorectal cancer screening is still relatively new
in the UK, and is undergoing a number of changes. We
therefore focussed on cervical cancer screening. The
aims were: (1) to establish the percentage of British
women classified into each cervical cancer screening
non-participant type, as outlined by the PAPM and (2)
to identify sociodemographic correlates with each non-
participant type.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
Data were collected by TNS (a market research agency)
as part of their Omnibus survey, in which data are
collected during one interview on behalf of multiple
L.A.V. Marlow et al. / European Journal of Cancer 80 (2017) 30e38
31
 independent bodies. For each survey, TNS randomly
select approximately 158 sampling points based on 2011
census data and the Postcode Address File. Interviewers
approach households and invite eligible people to take
part. At each location, preset quotas are set for gender,
employment status and presence of children in the
household. TNS do not provide a response rate.
We commissioned six waves of data collection esti-
mating that this would achieve a sample of 3600
screening-eligible women (i.e. aged 25e64�years) across
Great Britain. We anticipated that 13% (around 400
women) would be non-participants (based on previous
surveys). This was expected to be sufficient for exploring
sociodemographic differences between non-participant
types. Data were collected in January/February 2016.
Ethical approval was obtained from the University
College, London (UCL) Research Ethics Committee
(ref: 7585/001).
3. Measures
3.1. Screening history and future intention to be screened
Data were collected using face-to-face computer-assisted
personal interviews (CAPIs). In Britain, women are
invited for screening every 3�years (25- to 49-year-olds)
or 5�years (50- to 64-year-olds). Four questions assessed
past screening behaviour and future intention to be
screened (see box 1), and an algorithm was used to
classify women into one of six types of participation (see
Fig. 2).
Women who were up-to-date and intending to be
screened when next invited were classified as partici-
pants. The remaining women were classified as non-
participants and fell into one of five types: Unaware,
Unengaged, Undecided, Decided not to be screened,
Intending to be screened. Most of these women were
overdue for screening, but a few were up-to-date and
were classified as non-participants because they had
not formed strong intentions to attend in future
(n Z 42).
3.2. Sociodemographic characteristics
Sociodemographic variables were collected using items
designed by TNS or based on the 2011 census. These
included age, marital status, number of and age of
children and social grade. Social grade represented the
occupation of the Chief Income Earner in the house-
hold: AB managerial/professional; C1 supervisory; C2

Fig. 1. An adapted version of the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM) (Weinstein et al., 2008) demonstrating its use for explaining
cancer screening behaviour in the context of an organised programme. Screening eligible men/women may be unaware of screening and
once they become aware they may remain unengaged. After engaging with the screening decision they may remain undecided for an
unspecified time before forming an intention to be screened or taking the decision not to be screened. People who intend to be screened
may also remain at this stage for an unspecified time before actually participating. The need for repeated screening is indicated by the solid
arrows which illustrate how those who have been screened may then become undecided, may decide not to participate next time, or may
intend to participate in the next screening round.
Box 1
Women were told ‘In the UK, women who are aged be-
tween 25 and 64 are invited to participate in the National
Health Service (NHS) cervical screening program’ fol-
lowed by ‘Have you ever heard of cervical screening, also
known as the smear test or Pap test?’ (yes/no/don’t know)
and this was accompanied with a photograph of a woman
being screened. Those who responded yes were also asked
‘Have you ever had a cervical screening test?’ (yes/know/
don’t know), and if applicable ‘When was the last time
you had a cervical screening test?’ (within the last 3�years/
3e5�years ago/longer than 5�years ago/don’t know). All
women who had heard of screening were also asked ‘Do
you intend to go when next invited?’ (yes/no/don’t know)
with ‘I’ve never thought about it’ as an additional
response for those who had not been screened before.

4. Analysis
Data were analysed in SPSS v.22, version 22 of the
statistical software package, originally known as ’Sta-
tistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), now
known as IBM SPSS Statistics (used for data collection,
data mining, text analytics, batch and automated
scoring services). TNS provide sampling weights to
ensure that the data are population-representative in
relation to age, social grade and region. All analyses
were weighted using the complex samples function in
SPSS. Binary logistic regression was used to determine
sociodemographic differences between screening partic-
ipants
and
non-participants.
Multinomial
logistic
regression was then used to explore the odds of being
each individual non-participant type (relative to the
‘Participants’) by sociodemographic group (unadjusted
and adjusted). We have focussed on the results of the
unadjusted
analyses
because
understanding
the
sociodemographic characteristics of women in each non-
participant type is useful for targeting interventions,
regardless of whether associations are confounded by
other variables.
5. Results
Data were collected from 3661 women. Those who re-
ported having had a hysterectomy or cervical cancer
(n Z 369) and those over 60�years of age who lived in
Scotland (n Z 27) were excluded (cervical screening
stops at 60�years in Scotland). We also excluded those
who provided insufficient data to determine their
screening stage (n Z 152). Analyses were conducted
with 3113 women (weighted n Z 3111) aged 25e64 with
a mean age of 43�years (SE Z 0.20). See Table 1 for
sample characteristics. Using the PAPM staging algo-
rithm, 27% of women were classified as screening non-
participants.
5.1. Stages of non-participation
Among the 793 women who were classified as non-
participants, most were unaware of screening (28%),
intending to be screened but currently overdue (51%) or

 had decided not to be screened (15%). The proportions
who were unengaged or undecided were much smaller
(5% and 2% respectively; see Table 2). The following
analyses explore the sociodemographic characteristics of
each non-participant type with screening participants as
the reference category (see Tables 3 and 4). Unadjusted
analyses are described below. We excluded women who
were undecided about screening as the numbers were
small (n Z 15).
5.2. Age
Age was significantly associated with all four types of
non-participation. Women in each of the age groups
over 34�years were significantly less likely to be unaware
of screening than women in the 25- to 34-year age
group. A similar pattern was seen for being unengaged
with screening. Older women were also less likely to be
intending to be screened than those in the youngest
group. Conversely, women aged 55e64�years were
significantly more likely to have decided not to be
screened than women in the youngest group.
5.3. Social grade and working status
Social grade was associated with all four types of non-
participation. Compared with women in the highest
social grade (AB), women from each of the lower social
grades were more likely to be unaware and to be
intending to be screened, with each reduction in social
grade being associated with a corresponding increase in
likelihood of being unaware or intending to be screened.
Similar patterns appeared for the unengaged group and
for
those
who
had
decided
not
to
be
screened.
Compared with women who worked full-time, those
who were not working were more likely to be unaware
of cervical cancer screening.
5.4. Family structure (marital status, children)
Single women were more likely to be unaware of
screening, to have decided not to be screened, or to be
intending to be screened than married women. Previ-
ously married women were more likely to have decided
not to attend. Compared with those without a child

 under the age of 5�years, women who had a child under
5 were more likely to be unaware of screening, unen-
gaged with screening and to be intending to be screened,
but less likely to have decided not to attend.
5.5. Ethnicity and first language
Compared with white British women, women from each
ethnic minority group were more likely to be unaware of
screening. A similar pattern was seen for the unengaged
group. In addition, South Asian and Black women were
more likely to be intending to be screened than white
British women. Women with English as a second lan-
guage were more likely to be unaware, unengaged and to
be intending to be screened. After adjusting for lan-
guage, there were no longer any differences between
white British women and women from other white or
mixed ethnic backgrounds.
6. Discussion
This study advances our understanding of cancer
screening
non-participation
by
classifying
non-
participants into different types. Using the PAPM as a
framework, we identified three main types of non-
participants, and we suggest that these types should be
the focus of interventions to improve informed uptake.
The largest group of non-participants were those who
intended to go for screening but were currently overdue.
Previous studies have shown that intending to go but
not getting around to it is one of the most commonly
endorsed reasons for not attending among overdue
women [24], and the gap between intention and behav-
iour has long been recognised in behavioural science and
has previously been demonstrated for cervical screening
[25]. However, this is the first study to suggest that this
accounts for such a large proportion on non-attendance
(around half). Women who were 25e35 years old, those
who were single and those from lower social grades were
disproportionately likely to be in this group. In-
terventions designed to encourage action among these
women may involve ‘nudge’ style techniques [26] such as
additional reminders, which have already been sug-
gested to improve uptake among young women [17].
Small-scale studies have shown that asking women to
plan when, where and how they would make an
appointment (referred to as forming an implementation
intention) was effective for women who intended to go
for screening [27]. Changing the screening infrastructure
could also nudge women who intend to be screened, for

 example in a recent UK-based randomised controlled
trial
(RCT)
timed
appointments
improved
uptake
among non-attenders for their first invitation [28].
The second largest group of non-participants was
unaware of screening. It is surprising that such a large
proportion of women have not heard of cervical cancer
screening
when
everyone
should
have
received
a
screening invitation accompanied by a leaflet as part of
the NHS programme. The PAPM argues that awareness
is the first stage necessary before behaviour can occur,
and awareness is, of course, essential to informed choice.
Work in the context of colorectal cancer screening
suggests that many of those who have never been
screened have not read any of the information sent to
them [29]. Unaware women were more likely to be
younger and from lower social grade and/or ethnic mi-
nority backgrounds, consistent with previous studies
[30e32]. Interventions aimed at raising awareness of
cervical cancer screening are likely to be beneficial for a
significant proportion of women, yet written materials
may not be sufficient for this (as they are already used).
Awareness campaigns using other channels, such as TV,
radio and social media, or community outreach, may be
a more effective approach for this group. An early RCT
showed that in a diverse community, face-to-face visits
with
an
outreach
worker
were
more
effective
at
increasing cervical screening uptake than written mate-
rials alone [33].
The third biggest group of non-participants in our
survey was those who had decided not to be screened.
These women tended to be older and many had been
screened before. Further exploration of why this group
has decided not to be screened will help inform the
content of interventions for these women. Deciding not
to be screened is, of course, a legitimate decision
providing it is made on the basis of informed choice. If
women have decided not to attend because of a dislike
for the test, offering alternative tests such as an HPV
self-test or non-speculum testing, may overcome these
concerns [35,36].
6.1. Limitations
While
the
survey
sample was
broadly
population
representative and the cervical screening rates in the
study were similar to those reported by the national
screening programme [6], TNS do not collect informa-
tion needed to calculate a response rate or collect any
data from non-responders. Because the survey was car-
ried out within an omnibus, and therefore was not
described to participants as being health- or screening-
related, systematic bias due to interest in or beliefs
about this topic is unlikely. Moreover, interviews are
carried out in the evening as well as the daytime, and
there are quotas to ensure non-working women are not
over-represented.
However,
it
is
likely
that
some
participation biases remain. We relied on self-reported
screening uptake, and while this is how screening is
predominantly measured in surveys, social desirability
bias may lead to underestimates of non-participation or
time since last screening test [37]. A small group of
women were aware of screening but had not engaged
with the decision to attend. While we included these in
analyses as a separate group, the lack of significant
difference for this group could be due to small numbers.
While the PAPM includes longitudinal aspects, the data
presented here were collected cross-sectionally. Further
research using a longitudinal design would add support
to the use of the PAPM as a means of classifying non-
participants.
7. Conclusion
This work suggests that the vast majority of women in
Britain who are not participating in cervical screening as
recommended are not making an active decision not to
attend. Most non-participants are either unaware or
would like to be screened but are unable to translate
their positive intentions to be screened into action.
Drawing together the current findings with those in the
USA we suggest the PAPM is a useful way to distinguish
between
non-participant
types.
By
identifying
de-
mographic differences between non-participant types,
we provide important information for screening pro-
viders about how they might tackle low uptake. Further
exploration of attitudinal differences across different
non-participant types may provide useful guidance on
the content of these targeted interventions.
Role of the funding source
