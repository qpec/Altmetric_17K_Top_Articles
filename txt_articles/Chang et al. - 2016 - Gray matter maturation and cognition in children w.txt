Gray matter maturation and cognition in
children with different APOE e genotypes
ABSTRACT
Objective: The aims of the current study were to determine whether children with the 6 different
APOE e genotypes show differences in gray matter maturation, particularly for those with e4 and
e2 alleles, which are associated with poorer outcomes in many neurologic disorders.
Methods: A total of 1,187 healthy children (aged 3–20 years, 52.1% boys, 47.9% girls) with
acceptable data from the cross-sectional Pediatric Imaging Neurocognition and Genetics Study
were evaluated for the effects of 6 APOE e genotypes on macroscopic and microscopic cortical
and subcortical gray matter structures (measured with 3-tesla MRI and FreeSurfer for automated
morphometry) and on cognition (NIH Toolbox).
Results: Among APOE e4 carriers, age-related changes in brain structures and cognition varied
depending on genotype, with the smallest hippocampi in e2e4 children, the lowest hippocampal
fractional anisotropy in younger e4e4 children, the largest medial orbitofrontal cortical areas in
e3e4 children, and age-dependent thinning of the entorhinal cortex in e4e4 children. Younger e4e4
children had the lowest scores on executive function and working memory, while younger e2e4
children performed worse on attention tasks. Larger parietal gyri in the younger e2e4 children,
and thinner temporal and cingulate isthmus cortices or smaller hippocampi in the younger e4e4
children, predicted poorer performance on attention or working memory.
Conclusions: Our findings validated and extended prior smaller studies that showed altered brain
development in APOE e4–carrier children. The e4e4 and e2e4 genotypes may negatively influence
brain development and brain aging at the extremes of age. Studying APOE e polymorphisms in young
children may provide the earliest indicators for individuals who might benefit from early interventions
or preventive measures for future brain injuries and dementia. Neurology® 2016;87:585–594

APOE e4 is a well-known risk allele for Alzheimer disease (AD), especially late-onset AD, and
may lead to poorer outcome in neurologic disorders.1–4 In addition, APOE e4 may influence
brain development.5–7 However, the APOE e4 allele demonstrates antagonistic pleiotropy, with
deleterious effects on cognition, brain morphometry, and activation primarily after 55 years of
age, but no negative8 or even beneficial effects in adults younger than 50 years9,10 and children
aged 6 to 15 years.11–13 Compared to non–e4 carriers, healthy children carrying e4 (8–20 years)
tended to have thinner entorhinal cortex,5 while healthy infants carrying e4 showed altered brain
measures in regions affected by AD.6,7 Whether these structural differences influence cognitive
performance in children with e4 remains controversial.5,12–14

 APOE e2 also may affect brain variably.
The e2 carriers were less likely to develop clin-
ical dementia15,16 and had greater cognitive
reserve,17 since APOE e2 may be neuroprotec-
tive.17 However, e2 carriers also had more cor-
tical amyloid plaques,18 with elevated risks of
cerebral amyloid angiopathy17 and cortical in-
farctions.2 Furthermore, children carrying e2
performed worse on visuospatial tasks12 and
had thicker temporal cortices5 than non–e2
carriers, similar to adults carrying e2 with mild
cognitive impairment or AD.19
Because of potentially opposite influences
of APOE e4 and APOE e2, prior studies typ-
ically evaluated homozygous or heterozygous
e4 or e2 individuals, but frequently excluded
e2e4 participants.5,20,21 One study assessed all
6 APOE genotypes but only on IQ and aca-
demic achievements.13 Therefore, we evalu-
ated group differences across all 6 APOE e
genotypes on gray matter morphometry and
cognition in typically developing children.
We hypothesized that children with different
APOE e genotypes, especially e4 and e2 car-
riers (including e2e4), would show differential
gray matter measures and cognitive function
across the age span of childhood.
METHODS Participants. A total of 1,493 typically developing
children aged 3 to 20 years were enrolled in the Pediatric Imaging,
Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING) Study (http://ping.chd.
ucsd.edu) at 10 US academic institutions from September
2010 to August 2012. The PING Study was designed to cross-
sectionally investigate how genes influence brain maturation and
cognitive measures across childhood. Children were enrolled from
diverse ethnic groups and socioeconomic status (SES); detailed
participant criteria were reported previously.22 Specifically, the
1,187 children in the current study were excluded for any
confounding neurologic or psychiatric disorders, history of head
trauma, mental retardation, preterm birth (,36 weeks), prenatal
drug exposure (daily maternal illicit drug use .1 trimester), or any
MRI contraindications (including pregnancy).
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. All participants provided written assents (older than 7
years) or consents (18 years or older), and parental consents (3–17
years), which along with the protocol were approved by each of
the local institutional review boards for human subject studies.
Genotyping. Genomic DNA extracted from saliva was genotyped
in 1,187 children for APOE e (rs429358 and rs7412) using the
iPLEX Gold assay at the Sequenom MassARRAY genotyping plat-
form (Sequenom, San Diego, CA). Final genotypes were called
using the MassARRAY Type, version 4.0. Replication and
quality-control procedures were described previously.22 Genetic
ancestry factor (GAF) was determined with the ADMIXTURE
software (https://www.genetics.ucla.edu/software/admixture/) and
the Illumina Human660W-Quad BeadChip for the 6 major
continental populations (African, Central Asian, East Asian,
European, Native American, and Oceanic) in each child.
Magnetic resonance imaging. Image acquisition and process-
ing were detailed previously.22 All scans were performed on
3-tesla scanners (9 Siemens, 2 General Electric, 2 Philips) using
closely matched sequences. The protocol included 3-dimensional
T1-weighted
structural
MRI
(magnetization-prepared
rapid-
acquisition gradient echo, 1.0 3 1.0 3 1.2 mm3, 8 minutes) and
diffusion-tensor imaging (echo-planar imaging, 2.5-mm isotropic,
b 5 1,000 s/mm2, 30 directions, 10 minutes) (http://ping.chd.
ucsd.edu). Image processing included verification of protocol
compliance and quality assurance. Automated morphometry
using a modified FreeSurfer software was performed on the whole
brain, and 7 subcortical and 20 cortical regions of interest (ROIs)
from the standard FreeSurfer atlas were selected based on reported
APOE e effects in children5 and neonates,6,7 or patients with AD.4
Fractional anisotropy (FA) (corrected for B0 inhomogeneities) in the
same 7 subcortical ROIs was also assessed, since FA in these regions
often increases during neurodevelopment.23 Of 1,187 children,
1,080 met quality criteria for morphometry and 988 for FA.
NIH Toolbox. The NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery comprised
7 tests that assessed 8 cognitive domains.24 Four domains found
abnormal in patients with AD or e2 or e4 carriers25–27 were analyzed:
(1) executive function–cognitive flexibility (Dimensional Change
Card Sort Test); (2) visual attention (Flanker Inhibitory Control
and Attention Test); (3) episodic memory (Picture Sequence Mem-
ory Test); and (4) working memory (WM) (List Sorting WM Test).
For these domains, 1,060 children had acceptable data.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using
the
PING
data
portal
(https://ping-dataportal.ucsd.edu).22
Genotype and genotype-by-age effects on morphometry and
FA, and their relationships with cognition, were assessed with
a general additive model (GAM) in R program (http://www.r-
project.or/). GAM is a multiple linear regression model including
smooth functions of variables that are data driven. Each model
used age as a smooth independent variable and included a linear
term for genotype and a smooth age-by-genotype interaction.22
GAMs used thin plate regression splines for the smoothing basis
(using the bs 5 “ts” specification), with basis dimensions k 5 4
for main-effect smooth terms (e.g., age) and k 5 3 for smooth
interaction terms (e.g., age-by-sex).
All models covaried for SES (highest parental education and
household income), sex, GAF, and scanner device. Subcortical
volumes were adjusted for intracranial volume but not for average
cortical thickness and area. For vertex-wise analyses, significance
maps were thresholded at 5% using the false-discovery rate to cor-
rect for multiple comparisons. ROI-based analyses were corrected
for multiple comparisons using the Holm-Bonferroni sequential
method, which controls the family-wise error rate, using a step-
wise procedure to adjust for significance levels instead of p values,
and is uniformly more powerful than the Bonferroni correction.28
Pairwise post hoc analyses were explored for contrasts with group
differences on the GAM. Two children with e2e2 were not
included in group analyses but are described separately.
RESULTS Participant characteristics. The 1,187 chil-
dren were aged 12.1 6 5.0 years; 569 were girls (table
e-1 on the Neurology® Web site at Neurology.org).
The 5 APOE e allele groups were similar in sex
proportion. The e2e2 children were the youngest
and e2e3 children were the oldest; e3e3 was most
common (61.78%), followed by e3e4 (21.8%), e2e3

 (11.9%), e2e4 (2.6%), and e4e4 (1.75%), with e2e2
the rarest (0.17%). All genotype groups showed
significant European GAF (60%–70%), except for
e4e4 (35% European, but higher African ancestry
than other groups). Parents/guardians of e4e4 children
had the lowest household income, education, and
occupation levels.
Subcortical volume differences across genotypes. The
hippocampi differed across genotype groups (figure
1, A and B; table e-2). Independent of age, e3e4
children had the largest, while e2e4 children had
the smallest hippocampi across groups (figure 1B).
Hippocampal volumes increased linearly with age
but differed by APOE e genotype, with an inverted
U shape in e3e3 children (peaking at 13.2 years). The
2 children with e2e2 had relatively large hippocampi.
Genotype-by-age on subcortical FA. Age-dependent FA
changes were evaluated in all subcortical structures
(table e-2; figure 1, B–F). In the right hippocampus,
FAs in e4e4 children were lower at younger ages
(younger than 7 years) but normalized thereafter,
with no changes with age (figure 1B). As a group,
e2e4 children had the highest FA, while the younger
e2e2 child showed the lowest hippocampal FA.
Conversely, in the left amygdala, younger children
(,7 years) with e4e4, e2e4, and e2e3 had lower
FA than e3e3 and e3e4 groups, whose FA was con-
stant with age (figure 1D). The left thalamus FA
increased with age in all children (figure 1E), but
children younger than 7 years with e2e4 and e4e4
had lower FA, while children older than 12 years with
e4e4 showed higher FA (figure 1E).
APOE e genotype on cortical measures. Several cortical
areas differed by APOE e genotype (figure 2A), with
parallel age-related trajectories (validated in the ROI
model) (figure 2, A–D; table e-3). For these regions,
Figure 1

(A) Right and left hippocampal volumes are shown as averaged values (since they were not significantly different) across the 6 APOE e genotypes. Note the
relatively larger volumes in the 2 individuals homozygous for e2 (black) and the smallest volumes across the age range and genotype groups in those with
e2e4 (blue, e2e4 , e3e3, p 5 0.007). (B) Right hippocampal FA is relatively stable across the age range except for the children with e4e4 (red), especially those
at younger ages (similar age-related curve is seen in the left hippocampus; table e-2). The younger child with e2e2 also showed the lowest FA in the
hippocampus (black). (C) Segmented hippocampi shown in 3 orientations (arrows). (D) The younger children (,10 years) with e2 allele (e2e2, e2e3, and
e2e4) and e4e4 showed relatively lower FA in left amygdala. (E) Younger children with e2e4 and e4e4 also showed relatively lower FA in left thalamus (post
hoc test: e2e4 , e3e3, p 5 0.01). (F) Log p value maps of the brain regions showing age-by-genotype interactions (see also table e-2). *Data for the e2e2

 e2e4 children showed the smallest areas, while e4e4
or e3e4 children had the largest areas (figure 2, B–D).
The 2 children with e2e2 had exceptionally large
areas. The selected cortical volumes decreased with
age for all genotypes. Compared with other groups,
e2e4 children had larger left inferior parietal gyrus
and right superior parietal gyrus at younger age
(,10 years) but smaller volumes during adolescence
(figure 3, A and B).
For cortical thickness, the right isthmus cingulate
showed age-dependent thinning, except for e4e4 chil-
dren who showed no change with age (figure 3C).
Conversely, temporal pole thickness was constant with
age, except for e4e4 children who showed age-related
increases, with thinner cortices in younger and thicker
cortices in older individuals (figure 3D). Furthermore,
since prior reports compared e4 carriers (e4e4, e4e3)
with non–e4 carriers (e3e3, e2e3),5,29 we performed
vertex-based, whole-brain analyses using the same
grouping. Compared to non–e4 carriers, e4 carriers
had nonsignificantly thicker left entorhinal cortex
(figure 4A, yellow region), verified on ROI analyses
(figure 4B), and nonsignificantly thinner dorsal post-
central and lateral temporal cortices (figure 4A, lighter
blue). However, cortical thickness showed a trend for
group differences on age-dependent measures in para-
hippocampal regions and the left postcentral and
entorhinal cortices (figure 4C, yellow regions). ROI
analyses verified group differences in age-dependent
thinning in the left entorhinal cortex. Specifically,
Figure 2
APOE e genotypic variations on cortical areas
(A) The p value maps using the vertex model reveal significant APOE e effects (red and yellow) on cortical surfaces of the insular cortex, the temporal poles, as
well as the 3 right hemisphere regions (lateral occipital, medial orbitofrontal, and cuneus) shown to be different across genotypes on the region-of-interest
model (see B–D). The e2e4 group showed the smallest cortical areas across the age range in the right lateral occipital cortex (B), right cuneus (C), and right
medial orbitofrontal cortex (D). Post hoc analysis shows that, relative to the reference e3e3 group (brown), the e2e4 group (blue) had significantly smaller right
medial orbitofrontal cortical areas (p 5 0.006) and smaller right cuneus areas (p 5 0.002), while the e3e4 group (purple) had larger lateral occipital (p 5
0.016) and medial orbitofrontal cortical areas (p 5 0.006). The e4e4 group (red) also had the largest areas among all groups in the right cuneus (e4e4 . e2e4,
p 5 0.07) and right lateral occipital area (e4e4 . e2e4, p 5 0.04). The children with e2e2 (black) had relatively large cortical areas in the cuneus and right
medial orbitofrontal regions, largest in the younger e2e2 child. See also table e-3 for additional results. *Data for the e2e2 children are not included in the
group analyses.

 e4e4 children showed the steepest slope (r 5 20.66,
p 5 0.02), with thicker cortices in younger children
but thinner cortices in older children (.11 years;
figure 4D), as reported for adolescents.5
APOE e genotypes and age on cognitive performance.
Age-by-genotype interactions were found on execu-
tive function, attention, and WM (figure 5, A–C)
but not episodic memory. Compared to other geno-
type groups, younger e4e4 children had lower scores
on executive function and WM, but similar or better
performance after age 8 years (figure 5, A and B). On
the attention task, younger e2e4 children performed
worse than other genotype groups, but their scores
normalized after age 10 years (figure 5C).
Relationships between brain morphometry and cognition.
After adjustments for sex, SES, and GAF, brain regions
with age-related genotype variations also showed
differential correlations with attention or WM. In the
right superior parietal gyrus, e2e4 children differed
from other groups; those with larger superior parietal
gyral volumes had the lowest attention (r 5 20.58,
p 5 0.001; figure 5D) or WM scores (r 5 20.59, p 5
0.0005; figure 5E). Similarly, across genotypes, e2e4
children
with
thicker
cortices
had
the
poorest
attention (right isthmus cingulate: r 5 20.62, p 5
0.0002, figure 5F; temporal pole: r 5 20.43, p 5
0.01, figure 5G), while e4e4 children with thinner
temporal poles had poorer attention (r 5 10.5, p 5
0.02; figure 5G). All children with smaller hippocampal
volumes had poorer WM performance, especially e4e4
children (r 5 10.48, p 5 0.03; figure 5H).
DISCUSSION The APOE e gene is polymorphic
with 3 alleles, with e3 being the most common
(approximately 78%), followed by e4 (14%) and e2
(8%).15 Evaluating all 6 APOE e genotypes in a large
cohort of typically developing children clarified the

parietal cortices at younger age (,10 years), but the smallest average volumes during adolescence. (C) The isthmus of the cingulate showed age-dependent
thinning in all children except for those with e4e4. (D) In contrast, all children showed relatively stable temporal pole thickness (averaged left and right) across
the age range, except for the children homozygous for e4. All models for regions of interest were generated from the general additive model with thickness or
volume of the region of interest as dependent variable, covarying for sex, scanner device, socioeconomic status, and genetic ancestry factor. *Data for the

 associations of heterozygous vs homozygous e2 and
e4 on brain development. The major findings are as
follows: (1) compared to other genotype groups,
e4e4, e2e2, and e2e4 children had altered age-
related slopes in brain regions often affected in
AD30; (2) smaller hippocampal volumes in younger
e2e4 children and lower hippocampal FA in younger
e4e4 children mirror the smaller volumes and steeper
age-dependent atrophy of the hippocampi in elderly
e4 and/or e2 carriers31; and (3) the younger e2e4 and
e4e4 children with altered age-related changes in
brain measures also showed poorer performance on
attention or WM tasks.
Children with the most common e3e3 genotype
served as our reference group. These children showed
typical age-related increases in hippocampal volumes32
and the medial orbitofrontal and occipital cortical areas
until early adolescence.33 They also showed the typical
age-dependent increase in thalamic FA,23 reflecting
ongoing myelination, but not age-related increases in
hippocampal and amygdala FA, as reported in healthy
children without genotype groupings.23 Age-dependent
decreases in parietal cortical volume and thinning of the
isthmus likely reflect pruning of neuronal synapses and
cell shrinkage.33 Furthermore, our e3e3 children with
thinner isthmus had similarly better performance in
WM and attention.34
The children with APOE e2e3 genotype had com-
parable brain morphometry and cognitive performance
as e3e3 children. However, younger (,7 years) e2e3
children, like those with e2e4 or e4e4, had relatively
lower FA in left amygdala, suggesting lesser microstruc-
tural integrity, such as lower cellular density or lesser
myelination. Since the amygdala is involved in emotional
processing, these children may have greater vulnerability
to emotional problems. Lower amygdala FA was also
found in infants whose mothers had greater prenatal
depressive symptoms35; hence, future studies should
include maternal depressive symptoms as a covariate to
determine whether these symptoms might account for
the lower amygdala FA in younger e2e3 children.
Relative to e3e3 children, those with one e4 allele,
specifically APOE e3e4, had larger hippocampi,
occipital and frontal cortical areas, and thicker
Figure 4
Cortical thickness differences between e4 carriers and non–e4 carriers
These analyses were performed using the same grouping as prior studies.5 (A) On the vertex-based analyses (covaried for
age, sex, scanner device, socioeconomic status, and genetic ancestry factor), compared to e4 noncarriers (668 e3e31 and
124 e2e3), e4 carriers (235 e3e41 and 21 e4e4) showed nonsignificantly thicker right precuneus (data not shown) and left
entorhinal cortices (red-yellow regions), and nonsignificantly thinner left postcentral (parietal) and left lateral temporal
cortices (blue areas). (B) Region-of-interest analysis of the left entorhinal region verified the nonsignificantly thicker cortex
in e4 carriers (red dots) than non–e4 carriers (blue dots). (C) The 4 genotype groups showed a trend for group differences (p 5
0.13) on age-dependent changes in cortical thickness in the left entorhinal and parahippocampal regions as well as the left
postcentral cortex (yellow regions). (D) Region-of-interest analyses verified the age-dependent group differences; however,
the e4e4 children (red dots) showed steepest age-dependent thinning in this brain region, with thicker cortices in the
younger children but thinner cortices in the older children (.11 years).

 temporal poles, but similar cognitive functioning.
These larger brain measures are consistent with an
antagonistic pleiotropic effect of e4, similar to findings
in middle-aged (51–59 years) heterozygous e4 carriers
(primarily e3e4).3,10 Normal or thicker cortices in our
e3e4 children contrast with prior findings of thinner
left entorhinal and orbitofrontal cortices (92% e3e4
compared to e3e3 children).5 However, larger cortical
areas in our e3e4 children resemble larger parietal vol-
umes in e3e4 infants (ages 8.5–14 months)7 relative to
e3e3 participants. Moreover, consistent with our re-
sults, prior studies found similar IQ or cognitive per-
formance between e3e4 and e3e3 children.5,13
Despite the relatively normal hippocampal vol-
umes, the younger e4e4 participants had the lowest
FA in hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus, suggest-
ing slower development initially with lesser myelination
or lower cellularity in these regions. These children also
did not show typical age-dependent cortical thinning in
posterior cingulate (isthmus) cortex, which suggests
aberrant brain maturation, possibly due to reduced
synaptic pruning. Such possible aberrant brain matura-
tion with lesser cortical thinning was found in children
with prenatal alcohol exposure and fetal alcohol syn-
drome,36 although such children were excluded in the
current study. Furthermore, e4e4 children showed age-
dependent thickening of the temporal pole, which
along with the isthmus, is often affected in AD30,37
and in cognitively healthy e4 carriers,30 who showed
age-dependent increases in amyloid deposition.18

APOE e genotype-by-age interactions on executive function (A), attention (B), and WM (C). Children with larger right superior parietal gyral volumes had

isthmus cingulate cortical thickness (F) and temporal poles (G) had poorer attention and WM scores, especially children with APOE e2e4. In contrast, children
with APOE e4e4 with thicker cortices had better attention and WM scores (F and G). All children with larger hippocampal volumes had higher WM scores (H),
especially children homozygous for APOE e4 (H). *Data for the e2e2 children (black dots) are not included in the group analyses. ROI 5 region of interest;

 Younger e4e4 children showed the poorest exec-
utive function and WM among groups, even after
SES adjustment, similar to school-age e4 carriers with
AD family history.14 The normal cognition of our
older e4e4 children is consistent with prior findings
in older e4e4 children5,13 and in young and middle-
aged adults.10 The e4e4 children with smaller hippo-
campal volumes and thinner temporal pole had
poorer WM and attention; these findings resemble
the thinnest frontal cortices29 in middle-aged e4e4
individuals without dementia, who showed the most
rapid decline on mental arithmetic tasks requiring
WM.26 Hence, e4 homozygosity might slow matura-
tion of the hippocampus and cortical thickness,
which in turn might negatively affect WM and atten-
tion. Mirroring these findings, older individuals with
e4 homozygosity had the highest prevalence for AD
(50%–91%)4,15 and the greatest hippocampal and
temporal lobe atrophy30 among genotypes.
Unlike e3e4 children with the largest hippocampi,
e2e4 children had the smallest hippocampi and orbi-
tofrontal and occipital surface areas among groups
and across ages. Therefore, e4 allele effects differ
greatly when combined with e2 vs e3. Although the
younger e2e4 children had larger parietal cortices and
thicker posterior cingulate cortices, they had poorer
attention and WM. These findings also mirror those
in the 3 e2e4 oldest old (.90 years) among 89 par-
ticipants, since all 3 met criteria for dementia but not
neuropathology for AD.38 While e2 carriers showed
reduced cognitive decline, e2e4 is a risk genotype for
AD across ethnicity.15 Unfortunately, e2e4 partici-
pants are often excluded from studies because of
potentially opposite effects of e4 and e2.11,12,21,38
In the e2e2 children, the relatively large hippo-
campi are similar to the case reports of e2e2 adults,31
and the lower hippocampal FA in the younger child
suggests less coherent fibers in the large hippocampi.
They also had relatively higher thalamic FA, similar to
findings in e2 heterozygous adults.39 Our e2e2
children also had poorer attention and executive
function, while e2e2 children in a prior study showed
above-average IQ.13 Furthermore, a 92-year-old e2e2
woman showed no cognitive deficits until her stroke,
despite the postmortem finding of prominent AD
neuropathology.16 The relative preservation of cogni-
tion in aging e2e2 individuals may be due to ApoE
e2’s antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiproteo-
lytic effects.17 However, these processes may not be
relevant in the developing brain.
For comparison with the literature, we also evalu-
ated all e4 carriers. Hippocampal volumes in e4 car-
riers ranged from smaller (e2e4) to no difference
(e4e4) or slightly larger (e3e4) relative to e3e3
children. Similarly, cortical surface areas were smallest
in e2e4 but largest in e3e4 or e4e4. Hence,
combining all e4 carriers might have attenuated or
abolished group differences compared to non–e4
carriers,5–7,12,14,40 and the larger parietal volumes in
the youngest e2e4 children or the thinnest isthmus
gyrus and temporal poles in the youngest e4e4 chil-
dren might have been missed. In fact, our e4 carriers
collectively had nonsignificantly thicker temporal
lobes, contrasting with thinner entorhinal cortices
in a prior study of healthy e4 children.5 However,
further analysis showed that e4e4 children had
steeper age-dependent thinning in this region, leading
to thinner entorhinal cortices in adolescents, similar
to prior findings.5 Moreover, our youngest e4 carriers
performed poorer on WM than the non–e4 carriers,
which resemble WM deficits in older healthy e4
carriers.25
The age-dependent brain measures of e4e4 and
e2e4 children often deviated from those in the other
genotype groups. The youngest children with one of
these genotypes had less mature brain structures and
poorer cognitive function, but tended to normalize or
exceed the other genotype groups during late adoles-
cence. Prior studies of e4e4 and e2e4 young adults
showed larger specific brain structures and better cog-
nitive performance, whereas older adults showed
poorer cognitive performance or less efficient neural
networks relative to other genotype groups.9,10 Inci-
dentally, e2e4 participants have a low odds ratio of
AD until age 50 years, but the highest odds at age 70
years,15 while e4 homozygosity leads to earliest AD
onset (approximately 68 years).4
This study has several limitations. Despite this rel-
atively large sample, the age-related brain measures
may be biased by the cohort effect, driven by partic-
ipants with these rare genotypes at the extremes of age
range, in this cross-sectional study. Longitudinal
follow-ups are needed to confirm the true develop-
mental trajectories in the less prevalent e4 or e2 car-
riers. In addition, some younger children (,5 years)
could not perform all NIH Toolbox tasks; future
studies
with
more
young
children
using
age-
appropriate assessments are needed. Lastly, although
we covaried for GAF, ethnicity may influence the
effects of e4 and e2 on brain and cognitive meas-
ures.4,15 However, repeating all the analyses only in
children with .50% European ancestry yielded sim-
ilar results (table e-4, figures e-1 to e-3). Future stud-
ies should include a larger sample of children with
other ancestry and evaluate them separately.
This large sample of children validated and
extended prior smaller studies that showed altered
brain development in e4 carriers. The e4e4 and
e2e4 carriers appear to show the strongest antagonis-
tic pleiotropic effects, with negative influences on
brain structures and cognition at younger age, mirror-
ing those in elderly participants and patients with

 AD. Future studies of APOE e should evaluate each
genotype separately, since brain development, and
possibly brain aging and recovery, may vary substan-
tially across specific e4 or e2 genotypes. Finally,
studying APOE e polymorphism in young children
may provide early indications of risk of future brain
injuries and dementia. Given the urgent need to
determine how early patients with AD should receive
interventions or preventive treatments, a thorough
understanding of how AD risk genes, such as APOE
e4, might independently or interactively influence the
brain across the ages, is needed.

MACRA Changes How Neurologists Are Paid
What Is MACRA, and Why Is It Necessary?
The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015—MACRA—replaced the
Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate formula for calculating physician payments. The rapidly rising
costs of health care in the US are unsustainable. Changes in the health care system are essential and
must happen now.
How Will MACRA Affect Physician Payment?
Our health care system is moving from “fee-for-service” payments to a wider array of “value-based”
payment models that put the patient at the center of care by calling for the improvement of the
quality, safety, and overall experience of patient care while demonstrating cost-effectiveness by
providing care that is less expensive and delivers similar or improved clinical outcomes.
