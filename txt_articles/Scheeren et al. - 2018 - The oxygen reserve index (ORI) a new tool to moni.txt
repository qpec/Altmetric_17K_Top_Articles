Background
Oxygen administration can be life-saving since lack of 
oxygen (hypoxia) is deleterious and should be prevented 
or treated in a timely manner. This is why the vast major-
ity of patients in the operating room and in the intensive 
care unit (ICU) receive supplementary oxygen. However, 
oxygen has to be considered as a drug since the adminis-
tration of too much oxygen and the presence of hyperoxia 
are known to be associated with significant complications 
[1]. Oxygen therapy should therefore be precisely titrated 
and accurately monitored to avoid the consequences of both 
hypoxia and hyperoxia [2]. Pulse oximetry has become the 
prevalent monitoring technology to detect the presence of 
hypoxemia [3]. However, in order to monitor the oxygena-
tion status when the arterial blood is nearly fully saturated 
 
(SpO2 ≥ 97%) we need to rely on blood gas analysis, which 
is intermittent and invasive and occasionally delayed. New 
technological developments in multiwavelength pulse co-
oximetry expand our abilities to monitor oxygenation in 
the moderate hyperoxic range  
(PaO2 100–200 mmHg). In 
this review we will describe this new variable, termed the 
Oxygenation Reserve Index (ORI), and discuss its potential 
clinical utilities.
Abstract Supplemental oxygen is administered in the 
vast majority of patients in the perioperative setting and in 
the intensive care unit to prevent the potentially deleterious 
effects of hypoxia. On the other hand, the administration of 
high concentrations of oxygen may induce hyperoxia that 
may also be associated with significant complications. Oxy-
gen therapy should therefore be precisely titrated and accu-
rately monitored. Although pulse oximetry has become an 
indispensable monitoring technology to detect hypoxemia, 
its value in assessing the oxygenation status beyond the 
range of maximal arterial oxygen saturation  
(SpO2 ≥97%) 
is very limited. In this hyperoxic range, we need to rely on 
blood gas analysis, which is intermittent, invasive and some-
times delayed. The oxygen reserve index (ORI) is a new 
continuous non-invasive variable that is provided by the 
new generation of pulse oximeters that use multi-wavelength 
pulse co-oximetry. The ORI is a dimensionless index that 
reflects oxygenation in the moderate hyperoxic range  
(PaO2 
100–200 mmHg). The ORI may provide an early alarm 
when oxygenation deteriorates well before any changes in 
 
SpO2 occur, may reflect the response to oxygen adminis-
tration (e.g., pre-oxygenation), and may facilitate oxygen 
titration and prevent unintended hyperoxia. In this review 
we describe this new variable, summarize available data

The problem of hypox(em)ia
Although low oxygen tensions  
(PaO2 values <75 mmHg 
or <10 kPa) are frequently observed (e.g. at high altitude) 
and usually well tolerated by healthy individuals, they are 
deleterious for patients who undergo major surgery or dur-
ing critical illness. It should also be noted that oxygen ten-
sion is considerably lower at the capillary or mitochondrial 
level than it is in the atmosphere, alveoli or arterial blood 
(the “oxygen cascade”) [4].
In the perioperative setting, both hypoxia (i.e. lack of 
oxygen at the tissue level) and hypoxemia (i.e. low blood 
oxygen level) occur commonly and may be considered a 
serious safety concern. For instance, a recent report analys-
ing 95,407 anaesthesia records from 2 institutions revealed 
that 6.8% of patients had a hypoxemic event (defined by 
oxygen saturation,  
SpO2 <90%) during the intraoperative 
period, and that 3.5% of patients had a severely hypoxemic 
event  
(SpO2 <85%) lasting 2 min or longer [5]. The risk 
factors for the occurrence of such events include obesity 
[6, 7], difficult airway [8], rapid sequence induction [9], 
unrecognized esophageal intubation [8], one-lung ventila-
tion [10], and very young age [7, 11]. Hypoxemic events 
have been found to be even more frequent in the early post-
operative period in the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU). 
In a prospective blinded observational study including 
1500 postoperative patients, 37% had at least one period 
of hypoxemia  
(SpO2 <90%) lasting ≥1 h, while in 11% of 
patients such hypoxemia lasted ≥6 h [12]. Furthermore, 
8% of patients spent ≥5 min/h with an  
SpO2 <85%, and 3% 
spent ≥30 min with an  
SpO2 <80% [12]. Another retro-
spective analysis of 137,757 patients in the PACU revealed 
that many of the hypoxemic events occurred ≥30 min 
after PACU admission, i.e. when the anaesthesiologist 
has already left the patient and returned back to the OR 
for the next case [13]. Importantly, about 25% of these 
hypoxemic episodes lasted >10 min after their onset [13]. 
The first postsurgical day was similarly found to carry the 
highest risk of adverse respiratory events, most of them 
being hypoxic episodes [14]. Risk factors for postoperative 
hypoxemia include residual effects of anaesthetics, opioids 
or muscle relaxants [15], atelectasis [16], upper abdominal 
or thoracic surgery [17], smoking, pulmonary diseases, 
obesity and advanced age [18–20].
In general, a clear association between progressively 
lower  
PaO2 and increasing in-hospital mortality has been 
demonstrated also in ICU patients [21]. For instance, airway 
problems may occur in the ICU setting as well [22], and 
lead to particularly adverse outcome [23]. A recent study 
on 97,844 mechanically ventilated patients across 165 ICUs 
in the US revealed that mortality was increased in patients 
extubated overnight compared to those being extubated at 
daytime [24].
3  
The problem of hyperox(em)ia
Exposure to pure  
O2 for longer periods provokes pulmo-
nary inflammation (hyperoxic acute lung injury, HALI, or 
“O2-toxicity”), but in the absence of high-stretch mechanical 
ventilation, the risk of HALI is minimal when the  
FiO2 is 
≤0.6, and the risk probably begins when the  
FiO2 exceeds 
0.7 for several hours (≥24 h). However, resorption atelec-
tasis, which increases right-to-left blood shunting and dete-
riorate pulmonary gas exchange, may appear within minutes 
after induction of anaesthesia and increase postoperative 
pulmonary complications [25]. Likewise, a high  
FiO2 might 
cause respiratory depression in situations where respiratory 
drive becomes oxygen dependent, such as in patients with 
COPD or in postoperative patients with atelectasis and resid-
ual pain medication.
Furthermore, hyperoxia (high  
PaO2) decreases cardiac 
output by decreasing heart rate and causing systemic vaso-
constriction [26]. Furthermore, hyperoxia is a potent vaso-
constrictor stimulus to the coronary circulation, functioning 
at the level of the microvascular resistance vessels. This is 
why the hyperoxia related to routine use of high-flow oxy-
gen in uncomplicated myocardial infarction may result in a 
greater infarct size and possibly increase the risk of mortal-
ity [27]. Yet the use of supplemental oxygen is widespread 
in cardiac patients, exposing them to significant periods of 
potential detrimental hyperoxia without monitoring oxygen 
tension [28]. It is noteworthy in this context that a lower 
 
FiO2 had no worse outcomes during cardiac surgery when 
compared to the higher concentrations that are commonly 
used in this setting [29].
Finally, it has recently been shown in volunteers that 
normobaric hyperoxia decreased capillary perfusion and 
muscle oxygen consumption and increased microcirculatory 
perfusion heterogeneity [30]. Since such microcirculatory 
alterations are independently associated with worse patient 
outcomes [31], the use of hyperoxia as a therapeutic strategy 
may be deleterious. Last but not least a very recent study has 
shown in 480 ventilated ICU patients that a conservative 
oxygen treatment causing only small differences in  
PaO2 (87 
vs. 102 mmHg) might cause a significant mortality benefit 
(11 vs. 20%) [32].
Despite these negative effects, unintended hyperoxia 
seems to be quite common in daily ICU practice. Accord-
ing to a large Dutch study including 5498 mechanically 
ventilated patients, hyperoxia  
(PaO2 >120 mmHg) was 
found in 22% of the arterial blood gas samples, but the 
 
FiO2 was subsequently decreased in only 25% of these 
instances, implying that hyperoxia was accepted [33]. In 
fact, another study found that ICU patients spent most of 
their time (59%) in hyperoxemia, and when this occurred 
at an  
FiO2 between 0.3 and 0.4, no  
FiO2 adjustments were 
made in 88% of these episodes [34]. Liberal oxygenation

is also common in the pediatric ICU [35], despite existing 
guidelines to the contrary.
When looking at the relation between oxygen therapy 
and outcome, a recent study involving 14,441 ICU patients 
showed that severe hyperoxia  
(PaO2 >200 mmHg) was 
associated with higher mortality rates (odds ratio 1.35) and 
fewer ventilator-free days compared to both mild hyper-
oxia  
(PaO2 120–200 mmHg) and normoxia. However, the 
adjusted probability of in-hospital death showed its low-
est values at  
PaO2 values between 120 and 160 mmHg 
[36]. Similar results were obtained in a previous study 
observing more than 36,000 patients from 50 ICUs in the 
Netherlands that revealed a U-shaped relationship between 
mortality and arterial  
PO2, with a nadir at  
PaO2 values of 
15–20 kPa (110–150 mmHg) [37]. Similar results have 
been reported recently in two major trials including more 
than 5000 and 6000 patients after resuscitation from 
cardiac arrest, respectively: mortality sharply increased 
both at  
PaO2 values <9 kPa (<67 mmHg) and >30 kPa 
(>225 mmHg) [38], and hyperoxia was independently 
associated with increased in-hospital mortality [39]. In 
addition, a recent meta-analysis of 16 studies covering 
more than 49,000 patients revealed a crude odds ratio 
of 1.38 (95% CI 1.18–1.63) (p < 0.0001) for in-hospital 
mortality when patients were hyperoxic, independent of 
admission diagnosis [40]. However, a review of 152,680 
ventilated ICU patients demonstrated an association 
between hypoxia but not hyperoxia and increased in-hos-
pital mortality during the first 24 h [21].
So according to the evidence it is quite clear that hyper-
oxemia in critically ill patients is not beneficial and may 
increase mortality and that the optimal  
PaO2 is not yet 
clearly defined. However, there may be situations where 
short periods of hyperoxia may actually increase patient 
safety, e.g. during the induction of anaesthesia and for intu-
bation in ICU patients to delay the onset of hypoxemia dur-
ing apnea [41, 42]. In fact, various maneuvers have been 
proposed to extend the effect of preoxygenation, including 
the use of high-flow nasal oxygen [43–45].
Finally, there is some experimental evidence on the 
potential benefit of hyperoxia during resuscitation from 
hemorrhagic shock [46] but not in septic shock [47].

Monitoring oxygenation by pulse oximetry
Arterial blood gas analysis (aBGA) is considered the gold 
standard of monitoring the oxygenation status. It does, how-
ever, require arterial blood sampling, which is intermittent, 
invasive, associated with blood loss, costly, and the results 
are often delayed. As a result, significant changes in oxy-
genation may go unnoticed in-between aBGA’s when the 
arterial oxygen saturation  
(SaO2) is close to 100% and there-
fore no longer informative (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1  Arterial (red line) and venous (blue line) oxyhaemoglobin 
dissociation curves. In the hypoxic rage  
(PaO2 <100 mmHg), arte-
rial oxygenation can be assessed by pulse oximetry  
(SpO2). As  
PaO2 
increases beyond 100 mmHg, venous saturation  
(SvO2) at the meas-
urement site increases even though arterial saturation  
(SaO2) remains 
maximal and unchanged. This change in  
SvO2 causes changes in 
absorption of the incident light (and hence a change in measured 
signals) as  
PaO2 changes. With Masimo’s Rainbow SET technol-
ogy these signals are extractable and the system is able to detect 
changes in  
PaO2 through changes in  
SvO2 at the measurement site. 
 
SvO2 reaches a plateau beyond a certain level of  
PaO2, approximately 
200 mmHg (hyperoxic range), and consequently ORI is sensitive 
to the changes in  
PaO2 in the range between 100 and 200 mmHg 
(orange shaded area)

The most common method to monitor oxygenation is the 
non-invasive continuous pulse oximetry which has become 
a universal standard of care in anaesthesia, intensive care 
medicine, and other patient populations who are suscep-
tible to become hypoxemic [3]. Pulse oximetry measures 
hemoglobin oxygen saturation  
(SpO2) by light absorption 
typically at the finger or the earlobe. The accuracy of pulse 
oximetry as compared with invasive measurements is good 
with a bias between  
SpO2 and  
SaO2 <2% and a precision 
<3% [3].
It is of interest to note that although the routine monitor-
ing of  
SpO2 with pulse oximetry has become mandatory in 
anaesthesia and critical care, there is no formal evidence-
base showing its positive impact on patient outcome [48].
Nevertheless, and in agreement with current strong con-
viction, the relative number of respiratory complications 
during anaesthesia and associated malpractice claims has 
dropped significantly and consistently since the introduction 
of pulse oximeters [49, 50].
Pulse oximetry has a major limitation when it comes to 
assessing or preventing hyperoxemia in patients that receive 
oxygen therapy. Due to the sigmoid shape of the oxyhemo-
globin dissociation curve,  
SpO2 is near complete at a  
PaO2 
of 90–100 mmHg, and increasing the  
PaO2 above this level 
will no longer affect the  
SpO2. As a consequence, when 
 
SpO2 is ≥97%, the  
PaO2 level could be anywhere between 
90 and 600 mmHg. Hence, only a direct measurement of 
the  
PaO2, as part of aBGA, can be used to assess the hyper-
oxic range. Another way to assess oxygenation status in 
the hyperoxic range is by gradually decreasing the inspired 
oxygen concentration  
(FiO2) until  
SpO2 starts to decrease, 
as recently suggested [51]. This maneuver, however, takes 
several minutes and may culminate in undesirable low  
SpO2 
levels, making the procedure impractical in cases where the 
clinical situation does not allow to decrease the  
FiO2. As 
a result of these limitations, the monitoring of  
SpO2 alone 
cannot identify clinically important changes that may occur 
in the oxygenation status in the hyperoxic range, nor can it 
rule out the presence of unintended hyperoxia in patients 
receiving oxygen therapy.
Finally, pulse oximetry alone is a late detector of respira-
tory depression even when associated with considerable  
CO2 
retention if supplemental oxygen is being administered [52].

New development: the oxygen reserve index 
(ORI)
The oxygen reserve index (ORI) is a new development in 
multiple wavelength pulse oximetry that reflects, in real-time 
and non-invasively, the oxygenation status in the moderate 
hyperoxic range  
(PaO2 of approximately 100–200 mmHg, 
see shaded area in Fig. 1) in patients receiving supplemental 
oxygen. The measurement of this new variable has been 
made possible by the ability of multiwave length pulse co-
oximetry (Rainbow SET, Masimo Inc., Irvine, Ca., USA) 
to analyse both arterial and venous pulsatile blood absorp-
tion changes of incident light in a finger. When oxygen is 
being administered, the  
PaO2 increases to >100 mmHg and 
the  
SpO2 maximizes at close to 100%. However, the venous 
oxygen saturation  
(SvO2) at the measurement site continues 
to increase until it stabilizes (at about 80% saturation) when 
the  
PaO2 reaches about 200 mmHg (Fig. 1). By combining 
the Fick and oxygen content equations, the resulting change 
in light absorption over this  
PaO2 range is the basis for the 
ORI calculation. Hence, the ORI is an index with a unit-less 
scale between 0.00 and 1.00, which is a relative indicator of 
changes in  
PaO2 in the moderate hyperoxic range (approxi-
mately 100–200 mmHg), and is aimed for use in patients 
receiving supplemental oxygen [53]. It has to be stressed 
that ORI is not equivalent to  
PaO2 and cannot replace arte-
rial blood gas analysis and/or ‘classic’ pulse oximetry. For 
further information about the principles of measurement and 
calculation of the ORI the interested reader is referred to 
reference [53] and the appendix of reference [54].

Preliminary results from the perioperative 
setting
There are two clinical studies published as of yet demon-
strating that the ORI may provide an early warning when 
arterial oxygenation deteriorates before any changes in 
 
SpO2 occur. In the first study, Szmuk et al. followed the 
ORI during induction of anaesthesia in 25 healthy children 
[54]. They found that ORI detected an impeding desatura-
tion in median of 31.5 s (range 19–34.3 s) before changes in 
 
SpO2 occurred and concluded that this represents a clinically 
important warning time, which might give clinicians time 
for corrective actions. This statement has been emphasized 
by the accompanying editorial, acknowledging a promis-
ing role of ORI for patient safety [55]. The second study 
looked at the relationship between ORI and  
PaO2 in 106 
patients undergoing surgery and found a significant posi-
tive relationship for both absolute values (r2 = 0.536) and 
changes of both variables (r2 = 0.421) in the  
PaO2 range up 
to 240 mmHg [56].
As illustrated in a plot obtained from an individual patient 
undergoing surgery (Fig. 2), the ORI (black line) indicated 
a decrease in oxygenation 30 min before the next aBGA 
(red diamond) revealed that the  
PaO2 had in the meantime 
decreased from 500 to 100 mmHg while the  
SpO2 (green 
line) remained unchanged [56].
Recently, we performed a validation study of ORI in 
healthy volunteers, preliminary results of which have been 
presented at the Euroanaesthesia 2016 meeting in London 
 383

[57]. Volunteers were breathing via a tight fitting facemask 
standardized oxygen concentrations in a stepwise fashion, 
ranging from ambient air  
(FiO2 0.21) to pure oxygen  
(FiO2 
1.0), followed by a short period of mild hypoxia  
(FiO2 0.14). 
As shown in the representative example (Fig. 3), the ORI 
followed closely the changes in  
PaO2 related to changes in 
 
FiO2, peaking at values of 0.55 and 0.60 respectively with 
maximum  
FiO2. A later gradual decrease in  
FiO2 led to a 
decrease in ORI values, which reached zero just before the 
 
SpO2 (green line) started to decrease following the breathing 
of the hypoxic  
FiO2. Our results clearly show that the ORI 
reflects changes in oxygenation due to changes in  
FiO2, and 
that a decline in ORI following a decrease in  
FiO2 occurs 
well before any changes in  
SpO2 occur. It is important to 
note that in a recently revised version of the disposable pulse 
oximeter sensor (code M rainbow R1), the ORI has been 
rescaled so that it will reach the maximum value of 1.0 in 
more patients.

The potential clinical utility of the ORI
7.1  
Response to oxygen administration 
and to preoxygenation
Since the ORI has been introduced into clinical practice 
only recently, we will provide a theoretical exploration of 
its possible clinical utility in patients who receive supple-
mental oxygen. First of all, the ORI may provide informa-
tion regarding the patient’s initial response to acute oxygen 
therapy [58]. This information may be of great importance, 
since the persistence of a low ORI in spite of a high  
FiO2 
may reflect the presence of high intrapulmonary shunt-
ing, ventilation/perfusion mismatch or hypoventilation. 
The most common example of V/Q mismatch is atelec-
tasis related to induction of anaesthesia. A major cause 
of anaesthesia-induced lung collapse in this period is the 
use of high inspired oxygen concentration. Loss of muscle 
tone and muscle paralysis, compression of lung tissue due 
to heart weight and loss of surfactant function reduces 
functional residual capacity, producing gas trapping and 
resorption atelectasis behind closed airways. All these 
mechanisms are well reviewed elsewhere [59–61].
The ORI may also prove useful during the pre-oxygen-
ation that is routinely done before endotracheal intuba-
tion and extubation and whenever there is an anticipated 
interruption in oxygen delivery (Fig. 4). The importance 
of performing preoxygenation correctly has been recently 
described again [42, 44, 62].
By increasing pulmonary oxygen reserve, well-performed 
preoxygenation may extend the ‘tolerable apnea time’, 
defined as the time until the  
SpO2 reaches 90%, to almost 
10 min [62], and hence make endotracheal intubation safer. In 
patients with normal pulmonary function, a well-performed 
preoxygenation can be easily tracked by the response of the 
ORI (Fig. 4). However, in obese patients and in the criti-
cally ill, preoxygenation by breathing 100%  
O2 alone may 
not achieve the expected increase in oxygen reserve, and 
further interventions like positive-pressure ventilation and 
CPAP may be necessary [62, 63]. The ORI may therefore be 
useful in identifying those patients who do not increase their 
oxygenation in response to preoxygenation, as reliance on the 
 
SpO2 only may be misleading in such cases [63]. Monitoring 
of ORI may also help in identifying a faulty preoxygenation 
technique, including a low or absent fresh oxygen flow, pres-
ence of gas-leaks due to an ill-fitting mask, shallow breath-
ing, too short pre-oxygenation period, etc.
7.2  
Better titration of  
FiO2
The ORI may be a useful tool for the correct titration of the 
 
FiO2. Although in the critically ill, ventilated patients pulse 
oximetry may be useful in maintaining patients above the 
hypoxemic levels by adjusting inspired oxygen fractions and 
ventilator settings [51], the  
SpO2 per se may not exclude the 
PO2

ORI sharply increases, making the effects of pre-oxygenation visible. 
Following intubation, the  
FiO2 is reduced and titrated so that the ORI 
remained slightly above zero, indicating sufficient oxygenation of the 
arterial blood and avoiding hyperoxia at the same time. With kind

presence of unintended hyperoxia without further time-con-
suming manipulations of the  
FiO2 or measuring aBGA. As 
stated before, unintended hyperoxia occurs very frequently 
in both adult and pediatric ICU patients [33–35].
7.3  
Early warning of impending hypoxemia
The recent Prospective Evaluation of a RIsk Score for 
Postoperative Pulmonary COmPlications in Europe (PERI-
SCOPE) study showed that about 4.2% of surgical patients 
develop postoperative respiratory failure, carrying an in-hos-
pital mortality of 10.3% (vs. 0.4% in the rest of the patients), 
and defined risk factors for development of postoperative 
respiratory failure [64]. Such susceptible high-risk surgi-
cal patients, including those who undergo bariatric surgery 
[65], may benefit from earlier detection of postoperative res-
piratory failure. These patients often receive oxygen therapy 
which, as said before, renders routine pulse oximetry to 
be an inadequate tool for an early detection of developing 
hypoxemia and/or hypoventilation, so that postoperative 
monitoring with ORI should be considered.
The ORI might also be used to monitor oxygenation dur-
ing high-flow nasal cannula oxygenation, used in patients 
who are not or no longer intubated and mechanically ven-
tilated, in obese patients or during bronchoscopy [66]. Par-
ticularly the increasing number of obese patients admitted to 
the ICU postoperatively or requiring long-term non-invasive 
ventilation (NIV) might be a future indication for ORI moni-
toring in order to prevent respiratory failure [67] or unin-
tended hyperoxia.
Several recently published trials would have benefitted 
from the use of ORI if it had been available, such as two 
RCTs of apneic oxygenation during endotracheal intuba-
tion of the critically ill [68, 69], the CLOSE study com-
paring conservative versus a liberal oxygenation targets for 
mechanical ventilation [70], or the OPERA trial looking at 
the effects of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy to pre-
vent hyperoxia after major abdominal surgery [71].
7.4  
Immediate response to changes in PEEP 
and to recruitment manoeuvres
The ORI may reflect the immediate response of the  
PaO2 
to therapeutic measures like adjusting positive end-expir-
atory pressure (PEEP) and recruitment manoeuvres. In a 
recent pilot study we have examined the effects of recruit-
ing maneuvers on the ORI in ICU patients [72]. As can be 
seen in Fig. 5, the incremental increase in airway pressure 
during the maneuver is closely followed by an increase in 
the ORI. During the decremental PEEP trial (for finding the 
optimal PEEP) the ORI maintains a high value until the clos-
ing point appears where a sharp decrease in ORI is observed. 
This example demonstrates that the ORI may be a useful 
non-invasive tool for following oxygenation at any  
FiO2 dur-
ing recruiting maneuvers and determining the optimal PEEP 
for an individualized lung-protective strategy in ICU patients.

Possible limitations of the ORI
Although the ORI may reflect oxygenation in the moderate 
hyperoxic range, it should not be considered as equivalent 
to  
PaO2 and is certainly not meant to replace pulse oximetry 
 
(SpO2). The ORI should be considered as complementing 
Fig. 5  Representative example of simultaneous trends in Compli-
ance (ml/cmH2O),  
CO2 elimination per breath (ml), airway pressure 
(Paw,  
cmH2O), transpulmonary pressure (PTP,  
cmH2O) and ORI 
values of a patient during a recruiting maneuver (RM). While Paw 
rises in steps at the beginning of the RM, PTP and compliance rise 
accordingly and ORI increases up to a maximum value. Increases of 
dead space due to distention reduces the  
CO2 elimination per breath. 
During the decremental PEEP trial, step-reductions in Paw and PTP 
do not reduce compliance or ORI values until a closing point is 
observed. The dotted arrow shows this point in which an abrupt drop 
in compliance and ORI coincide with a negative value of TPT indi-
cating re-collapse of the lung. The optimal PEEP corresponds to the 
previous setting

SpO2 for monitoring the oxygen status in patients receiving 
supplemental oxygen. Since the ORI measurement and cal-
culation are affected by a variety of factors (e.g., pH, temp, 
 
PaCO2, etc.) it has a significant inter-individual variability. 
In addition, most individuals will not reach an ORI above 
0.6–0.7 (at least with the first version of the ORI sensor) 
when breathing at an  
FiO2 close to 1.0, so that an individu-
alized scaling of the maximum ORI being reached while 
breathing pure oxygen might be useful. Finally, like pulse 
oximetry  
(SpO2), the ORI may not read when peripheral 
perfusion (at the finger) is impaired, such as in shock states 
or during high-dose vasopressor therapy.

ORI summary
Figure 6 summarizes the place that the ORI could take in 
monitoring the patient`s oxygenation status, namely the mild 
hyperoxic rage  
(PaO2 100–200 mmHg). Below this range, 
pulse oximetry can easily be used to detect a decrease in 
 
SpO2. For higher  
PaO2 values, invasive arterial blood sam-
pling and aBGA must be used.

Conclusions
The ORI is a new promising variable that serves as a rela-
tive indicator of the  
PaO2 in the range of 100–200 mmHg. Its 
addition to conventional pulse oximetry opens new opportu-
nities in the continuous, non-invasive monitoring of the oxy-
genation status in patients receiving supplemental oxygen. The 
ORI may potentially allow better control of pre-oxygenation, 
provide an alarm of decreasing oxygenation well before any 
decrease in  
SpO2, allow a more adequate titration of oxygen 
therapy and prevent unintended hyperoxia, and reflect the 
immediate impact of recruitment maneuvers and PEEP adjust-
ments. Further studies are needed to determine the potential 
role of the ORI in the management of acutely ill patients who 
are in need of oxygen supplementation.
