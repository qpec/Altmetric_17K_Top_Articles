Why are acute ischemic stroke patients not
receiving IV tPA?
Results from a national registry
ABSTRACT
Objective: To determine patient and hospital characteristics associated with not providing IV tis-
sue plasminogen activator (tPA) to eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in clinical
practice.
Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with AIS arriving within 2 hours
of onset to hospitals participating in Get With The Guidelines–Stroke without documented contra-
indications to IV tPA from April 2003 through December 2011, comparing those who received
tPA to those who did not. Multivariable generalized estimating equation logistic regression mod-
eling identified factors associated with not receiving tPA.
Results: Of 61,698 eligible patients with AIS presenting within 2 hours of onset (median age
73 years, 51% female, 74% non-Hispanic white, median NIH Stroke Scale score 11, interquar-
tile range 6–18), 15,282 (25%) were not treated with tPA within 3 hours. Failure to give
tPA decreased over time from 55% in 2003 to 2005 to 18% in 2010 to 2011 (p , 0.0001).
After adjustment for all covariates, including stroke severity, factors associated with failure
to treat included older age, female sex, nonwhite race, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke,
atrial fibrillation, prosthetic heart valve, NIH Stroke Scale score ,5, arrival off-hours and not
via emergency medical services, longer onset-to-arrival and door-to-CT times, earlier calendar
year, and arrival at rural, nonteaching, non–stroke center hospitals located in the South or
Midwest.
Conclusions: Overall, about one-quarter of eligible patients with AIS presenting within 2 hours
of stroke onset failed to receive tPA treatment. Thrombolysis has improved dramatically over
time and is strongly associated with stroke center certification. Additionally, some groups,
including older patients, milder strokes, women, and minorities, may be undertreated.

IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been demonstrated to improve outcome in select pa-
tients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and numerous guidelines have promoted its use in the
United States.1–6 As a result, IV tPA use has increased dramatically over the past decade, yet
approximately one-third of potentially eligible patients are not receiving treatment.7,8
The factors associated with not treating otherwise eligible patients have not been well charac-
terized in a large, national registry reflective of recent clinical practice. We hypothesized that
a number of specific patient and hospital factors will be associated with a lower likelihood of
treatment with tPA, some of which may be modifiable, leading to improved treatment rates in
the future.

 Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)–Stroke
is an ongoing, voluntary, national registry and
quality-improvement initiative. Since its incep-
tion in 2003, .1,800 hospitals have entered
.2.5 million patient records into the GWTG-
Stroke database, and prior reports have demon-
strated that the registry is representative of the
US population hospitalized for AIS.8–11 Appro-
priate and efficient use of IV tPA for AIS is
a major objective of the GWTG-Stroke initia-
tive, and sites are expected to provide the ratio-
nale for nontreatment from a prespecified list of
potential contraindications and warnings. We
sought to better understand the patient and hos-
pital characteristics associated with not using IV
tPA in otherwise eligible patients.
METHODS Within the GWTG-Stroke dataset, we identified all
patients who presented within 2 hours of onset of ischemic stroke
and had no documented contraindications to thrombolysis, and we
then compared patient- and hospital-level factors for patients who
received tPA to those who did not receive tPA. Several previous
publications have provided detailed descriptions of the GWTG-
Stroke program.12,13 In brief, GWTG-Stroke is a national stroke
quality-improvement program available to any hospital in the United
States since the beginning in April 2003. Participating hospitals are
instructed to collect deidentified patient-level data on clinical and
demographic characteristics, diagnostic testing, treatments, the reason
for not treating with tPA, adherence to quality measures, and in-
hospital outcomes and discharge disposition in consecutive patients
hospitalized with stroke. Trained hospital personnel identify patients
admitted
with
stroke
prospectively
by
clinical
diagnosis
or
retrospectively using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision discharge codes. The eligibility of each acute stroke is
confirmed at chart review before abstraction, and the specificity of
included patients and data accuracy have been demonstrated to be
high.14 After abstraction by trained personnel at each hospital,
deidentified patient data are entered into the GWTG-Stroke
database with the use of a web-based patient management tool
(Outcome, A Quintiles Company, Cambridge, MA). Data elements
abstracted include patient demographics, medical history and
comorbidities, initial brain imaging findings, in-hospital treatment
and events, discharge disposition, ambulatory status, and mortality.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. All participating institutions were required to comply
with local regulatory and privacy guidelines and to secure institu-
tional review board approval if required. Because data were used pri-
marily at the local site for quality improvement, sites were granted
a waiver of informed consent under the common rule. The Duke
Clinical Research Institute (Durham, NC) served as the data analysis
center, and institutional review board approval was granted to ana-
lyze aggregate deidentified data for research purposes.
Data. The GWTG-Stroke dataset was queried to identify all
patients admitted with AIS who arrived within 2 hours from
the time they were last known well and had no documented
contraindications to IV tPA. Over a period extending from
April 2003 through December 2011, GWTG-Stroke enrolled
1,138,157 patients admitted with AIS to 1,783 hospitals. In
2009,
the
American
Heart
Association/American
Stroke
Association published a scientific advisory supporting the use of
tPA within the 3- to 4.5-hour window, and GWTG-Stroke
disseminated this information to participating hospitals and added
a new quality measure to monitor patients who presented within
3.5 hours from the onset of stroke symptoms and were treated by
4.5 hours.15 For this analysis, we excluded the 3,422 patients who
arrived within 2 hours and were treated with tPA after 3 hours
because we were interested in identifying factors associated with
failure to treat, not delayed treatment. We also excluded patients
with stroke occurring after hospital admission (26,008); patients
treated with investigational use of thrombolytics (1,632); those
with uncertain time of onset to arrival (598,611) or time of tPA
treatment (527); those with time of onset to arrival .2 hours
(304,898); patients treated with IV tPA at a non-GWTG hospital
before transfer (16,973); patients treated at a site with ,10 patients
per year (809); and those with missing door-to-CT time, door-to-
CT time beyond 2 hours, or door-to-CT-time after tPA treatment
(7,558).
Statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics, including frequency
numbers and percentages for categorical variables and medians with
interquartile ranges describing the 25th and 75th percentiles for con-
tinuous variables, were generated. The relationships between individ-
ual patient and hospital characteristics and nontreatment with IV tPA
were assessed in univariable analyses with the Pearson x2 test for
categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous/
ordinal variables. To determine independent factors associated with
tPA nontreatment, we performed multivariable logistic regression
modeling using a generalized estimating equation to account for
hospital clustering. All hospital-level factors were analyzed at the
patient level. Because the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was
missing in a large number of cases (23.9% overall), separate
models were constructed with all patients (i.e., including those
without NIHSS score) and in only those with NIHSS score
documented, given its importance in quantifying stroke severity and
predicting outcomes.16 The functional form of continuous variables
with tPA treatment was explored with restricted cubic spline plots.
The models incorporated all the covariates described in table e-1 at
Neurology.org. Patient variables other than NIHSS had ,7% missing
values and were imputed to the most common category. Models
excluded observations with missing hospital characteristics (,2%).
For the models that included NIHSS score, we used a categorical
variable (0–4, 5–9, 10–14, 15–20, 211). All hypothesis tests are 2
sided, with values of p , 0.05 considered statistically significant. All
analyses were conducted by the GWTG-Stroke statistical analysis
center at the Duke Clinical Research Institute (Durham, NC) with
SAS software version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS Among the 177,719 patients who arrived
within 2 hours of onset and met all other inclusion cri-
teria, 116,021 (65%) had a documented contraindica-
tion to or warning for tPA use. As described in table 1,
the most common documented reasons for not treat-
ing with tPA were mild or rapidly improving symp-
toms (51%); advanced age (7%); patient or family
refusal (6%); CT findings of major infarct signs, intra-
cerebral hemorrhage, or subarachnoid hemorrhage
(6%); and platelets ,100,000, partial thromboplastin
time .40 seconds, international normalized ratio
.1.7, or bleeding diathesis (5%). Patient or family
refusal did not differ between teaching and nonteach-
ing hospitals, rural and urban locations, hospital sizes,

 regions of the country, or average annual volumes of
stroke patients (p . 0.05 for each).
There were 61,698 patients from 1,564 sites eligi-
ble for the GWTG-Stroke achievement measure of
IV recombinant t-PA arrive by 2 hours with treat-
ment by 3 hours (i.e., patients who had an onset-
to-arrival time of #120 minutes and did not have
any documented IV tPA contraindication or warn-
ing), of whom 15,282 (25%) did not receive tPA
while the remaining 46,416 (75%) received tPA
within 3 hours of onset. Nonuse of tPA among eligi-
ble patients decreased over time from 55% in 2003 to
2005 to 18% in 2010 to 2011 (figure).
Table 2 presents the univariable analyses of patient
and hospital characteristics of the cohort, overall and
dichotomized by treatment with IV tPA. Compared
with those treated with tPA, patients not treated with
tPA were older, white, and female. They more often
had vascular risk factors, including coronary artery
disease (CAD), carotid stenosis, diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, a prosthetic
heart valve, and prior stroke/TIA, although they were
less likely to have atrial fibrillation and to be a smoker.
They arrived less frequently by emergency medical
services (EMS), experienced a longer delay in door-
to-CT time, and more often had an undocumented
NIHSS score, and, when measured, their median
NIHSS score was lower. Compared with those treated
with tPA in the study period, patients not treated
with tPA presented to hospitals that had a smaller
number of beds, were less often teaching hospitals
or Joint Commission–certified primary stroke cen-
ters, were more often in the South or Midwest, docu-
mented the NIHSS score less frequently overall, and
had fewer annual ischemic stroke admissions.
After full adjustment for all covariates, there was
no longer an association between white race and high-
er odds of not being treated; instead, black race and
other race were associated with higher odds of not
being treated (table 3). Additional patient-specific
factors associated with nontreatment included older
age, history of carotid stenosis, peripheral vascular
disease, diabetes mellitus, CAD/myocardial infarc-
tion, stroke/TIA, and presence of a prosthetic heart
valve. Method and timing of hospital arrival also were
important, with patients with admission during an
earlier calendar year, non-EMS arrival, arrival after
work hours, or arrival at a longer duration after stroke
onset (i.e., last known well time) having lower odds of
receiving IV tPA. Several hospital characteristics were
also independently associated with not providing tPA
at the patient level. Hospitals that documented the
NIHSS score less frequently in all patients, were not
Joint Commission primary stroke centers or teaching
hospitals, had lower annualized volumes of stroke
patients, were located in the South or Midwest, or
were located in rural locations were less likely to treat
eligible patients with IV tPA. A sensitivity analysis
using multiple imputation to account for missing data
(excluding NIHSS score) found no meaningful differ-
ences in these results (table e-2).
Patients who had a documented NIHSS score had
notable differences compared to those who did not
have one documented (table e-3). When the model
was confined to the 73.5% of patients in whom
NIHSS score had been documented, women and pa-
tients with atrial fibrillation were less likely to receive
IV tPA, and smaller hospital size was no longer signif-
icant. Table 4 presents the adjusted odds of being
treated with tPA across strata of stroke severity. Com-
pared to those with mild stroke (NIHSS score 0–4),
patients with an NIHSS score $5 were more likely to

DISCUSSION As reported in prior studies, tPA treat-
ment in GWTG-Stroke–participating hospitals has
increased dramatically over time.8,11 Nevertheless,
even recently, up to 1 in 5 potentially eligible patients
were not being treated. In this large cohort, several
patient and hospital factors were independently asso-
ciated with a lower likelihood of receiving IV tPA in
eligible patients with AIS, many of which may be
modifiable. As has been reported previously, treat-
ment at a primary stroke center is one of the strongest
predictors of tPA use.17 Thus, to improve thrombol-
ysis rates, continued development of systems of care
for stroke should remain a high priority.
Underscoring a statement from the American
Heart Association/American Stroke Association calling
for an end to inequities in stroke care, we found that
after adjustment for stroke severity, minorities and, to
a lesser degree, women remained modestly more likely
to not receive treatment when tPA eligible.18 These
findings are consistent with several prior publications
including data from GWTG-Stroke.19–26 Our current
study includes more contemporary treatment data and
more extensive adjustment for potential known con-
founders than many prior studies.
In addition to race and sex differences, we found
that older patients were less likely to receive tPA treat-
ment despite having no documented contraindica-
tion. Again, these findings are consistent with prior
analyses.27,28 A recent survey of neurologists reported
that 4 of 5 were less likely to administer IV tPA to
patients with dementia, and many were less likely to
treat patients from nursing homes, with more severe
strokes, or .80 years of age.29 Although the benefit to
older patients has been uncertain in the past because
many were excluded from the early IV tPA trials, the
International Stroke Trial 3 (IST3) and recent meta-
analyses have demonstrated no upper age limit for
benefit of IV tPA.30–33
Several other patient factors were associated with
less treatment, including carotid stenosis, peripheral
vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, CAD/myocardial
infarction, stroke/TIA, and presence of a prosthetic
heart valve. These represent opportunities for more
targeted education to patients with these risk factors
on the need for rapid medical attention and available
treatment when stroke symptoms occur. Consistent
with prior publications, we found that arrival during
off-hours, at later times within 2 hours, or via other
modes of transport other than via EMS reduced the
odds of treatment.17,18 Multiple hospital characteristics
were also independently associated with not receiving
tPA, including failure to routinely document the
NIHSS score, not being a Joint Commission primary
stroke center or a teaching hospital, having a lower
annual volume of stroke cases, and being located in
the South or Midwest.
This analysis also contributes the description of
the prespecified contraindications and warnings that
excluded patients from treatment. By far the most
common reason cited, reported in more than half of
the patients, was mild or rapidly improving symp-
toms. Among patients without a documented reason
for not receiving tPA, mild stroke symptoms, defined
as NIHSS score ,5, were strongly associated with
a lower likelihood of being treated. Prior studies have
found that this is the most common reason given for

 not treating otherwise eligible patients with IV tPA,
yet multiple cohorts have found that up to one-third
of patients with mild stroke symptoms at presentation
will have poor long-term outcomes.34–37 Patients with
mild stroke symptoms were largely excluded from
prior randomized tPA trials until the IST3 random-
ized controlled trial of tPA up to 6 hours from symp-
tom onset. Subgroup analysis suggested that patients
with mild stroke did not appear to benefit from
treatment, although a post hoc analysis restricted to
treatment within 3 hours suggested a benefit, and
the most recent meta-analysis of tPA studies, includ-
ing IST3, suggests a potential benefit in mild
stroke.32,33,38 It is likely that patients with a low
NIHSS score and clearly disabling symptoms such
as a visual field deficit or isolated aphasia benefit from
tPA. Uncertainty remains about the efficacy of tPA in
mild stroke patients (i.e., those with low NIHSS scores
and deficits that are not clearly disabling). Phase III
trials are underway to test IV tPA in mild stroke patients
in the United States (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02072226)
and to test IV tenecteplase in patients with TIA or mild
stroke with visualized intracranial occlusion in Canada
(clinicaltrials.gov NCT02398656).
Many factors independently associated with lack
of IV tPA use relate to the rapidity of the evaluation,
including arrival via EMS, arrival during regular
workday weekday hours, and time from onset to
arrival. Thus, patient, family, and medical caregiver
education about acute stroke symptoms, the impor-
tance of the use of EMS in this setting, and interven-
tions that expedite the evaluation of potentially
eligible stroke patients would likely increase treat-
ment rates. A recent study showed that prehospital
notification by EMS, taking the patients directly from
the ambulance to the CT scanner, and initiating tPA
in the CT suite led to a dramatic 42% reduction in
door-to-needle times during regular workday hours.39
In the past, treatment times in GWTG-Stroke have
been below stated goals, and the Target: Stroke ini-
tiative was created to address this issue, resulting in
shorter treatment times and clear improvements in
survival, patients discharged home, and symptomatic
intracerebral hemorrhage.40
The GWTG-Stroke registry is among the largest
available datasets of hospitalized stroke patients in
the world and represents a mix of academic and non-
academic hospitals of various sizes from all the regions
of the United States. The GWTG-Stroke orientation
and continuing education for participating centers
emphasize the need to document why patients are
not receiving treatment. It is representative of the
Medicare fee-for-service population with ischemic
stroke, and the specificity of included patients and

 data accuracy have been demonstrated to be high.10,14
However, there are important limitations to this study.
First, it is possible that increases in tPA treatment rates
may reflect improved documentation of contraindica-
tions over time. However, documentation of the rationale
for nontreatment with tPA has been a key data point of
GWTG-Stroke since its inception, and a prior analysis
reported that the percentage of patients with documented
contraindications has remained static over time while
treatment rates have risen dramatically.41 A related

 concern is that some factors associated with not treating
with IV tPA were in fact associated with failure to doc-
ument that specific contraindication to treatment. In
addition, the effect of time factors may have been under-
estimated, given that we focused on the GWTG-Stroke
quality measure and included only patients who pre-
sented within 2 hours of stroke onset. Similarly, we
excluded patients who were treated beyond 3 hours of
onset because we were focusing on failure to treat. Delays
in treatment are a very important topic that we did not
assess. In addition, the assignment of race/ethnicity in
hospitals may underestimate nonwhite or Hispanic pop-
ulations and is often not based on interrogation of the
patient during emergency visits. Our findings regarding
mild stroke defined by low NIHSS score should be
interpreted with caution, given the large number of
untreated patients missing these data. The data from
GWTG-Stroke depend on the accuracy and complete-
ness of clinical documentation, and there are limited data
addressing the reliability and data quality in GWTG-
Stroke. Finally, residual measured and unmeasured con-
founding variables may have influenced the findings.
Although tPA rates have increased over the past
decade, about one-quarter of eligible patients are not
receiving treatment. To improve treatment rates, pa-
tients with stroke risk factors and their families should
be educated about potential stroke symptoms and
encouraged to call EMS if stroke is suspected. Contin-
ued efforts to develop stroke systems of care and estab-
lish stroke centers, to implement standardized protocols
for stroke recognition by EMS dispatchers and pro-
viders, and to accelerate triage in emergency depart-
ments with an emphasis on rapid brain imaging may
also improve treatment rates and timing. Older pa-
tients, women, and nonwhites, as well as patients with
milder strokes, may be undertreated. Additional studies
should be taken to address this potential disparity in
care for patients with AIS.
