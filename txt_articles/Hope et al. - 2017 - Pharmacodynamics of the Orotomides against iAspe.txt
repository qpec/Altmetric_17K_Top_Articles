ABSTRACT
F901318 is an antifungal agent with a novel mechanism of action and
potent activity against Aspergillus spp. An understanding of the pharmacodynamics
(PD) of F901318 is required for selection of effective regimens for study in phase II
and III clinical trials. Neutropenic murine and rabbit models of invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis were used. The primary PD endpoint was serum galactomannan. The
relationships between drug exposure and the impacts of dose fractionation on ga-
lactomannan, survival, and histopathology were determined. The results were bench-
marked against a clinically relevant exposure of posaconazole. In the murine model, ad-
ministration of a total daily dose of 24 mg/kg of body weight produced consistently
better responses with increasingly fractionated regimens. The ratio of the minimum total
plasma concentration/MIC (Cmin/MIC) was the PD index that best linked drug exposure
with observed effect. An average Cmin (mg/liter) and Cmin/MIC of 0.3 and 9.1, respec-
tively, resulted in antifungal effects equivalent to the effect of posaconazole at the up-
per boundary of its expected human exposures. This pattern was confirmed in a rabbit
model, where Cmin and Cmin/MIC targets of 0.1 and 3.3, respectively, produced effects
previously reported for expected human exposures of isavuconazole. These targets were
independent of triazole susceptibility. The pattern of maximal effect evident with these
drug exposure targets was also apparent when survival and histopathological clearance
were used as study endpoints. F901318 exhibits time-dependent antifungal activity. The
PD targets can now be used to select regimens for phase II and III clinical trials.
IMPORTANCE
Invasive fungal infections are common and often lethal. There are
relatively few antifungal agents licensed for clinical use. Antifungal drug toxicity and
the emergence of drug resistance make the treatment of these infections very chal-
lenging. F901318 is the first in a new class of antifungal agents called the oroto-
mides. This class has a novel mechanism of action that involves the inhibition of the
fungal enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. F901318 is being developed for clini-
cal use. A deep understanding of the relationship between dosages, drug concentra-
tions in the body, and the antifungal effect is fundamental to the identification of
the regimens to administer to patients with invasive fungal infections. This study
provides the necessary information to ensure that the right dose of F901318 is used
the first time. Such an approach considerably reduces the risks in drug development
programs and ensures that patients with few therapeutic options can receive poten-
tially life-saving antifungal therapy at the earliest opportunity.

nvasive fungal diseases remain common and lethal infections in immunocompro-
mised hosts. In clinical settings, antifungal therapy is complicated by frequent
diagnostic uncertainty, difficulties in assessing the therapeutic response, antifungal
drug toxicity, drug-drug interactions, and uncertainty about the appropriate duration of
therapy. These well-recognized issues in the routine care of patients are now increas-
ingly complicated by the rising specter of antifungal drug resistance (1), with mortality
from azole-resistant aspergillosis of 88 to 100% in uncontrolled series (2–4). Conse-
quently, new antifungal agents are urgently required.
The orotomides are a new series of antifungal agents with potent in vitro activity
against Aspergillus spp. and other medically important molds, such as Lemontospora
(Scedosporium) prolificans, certain species of Fusarium, and Penicillium spp., as well as
Taloromyces (formerly Penicillium) marneffei (5). This chemical series was discovered by
F2G Ltd. by screening a 300,000-compound library against Aspergillus spp. Notably,
there is no activity of the orotomides against yeasts like Candida and Cryptococcus
neoformans and no activity against the Mucorales (5). The orotomides have a com-
pletely novel mechanism of action whereby fungal pyrimidine biosynthesis is disrupted
via reversible inhibition of the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), which
is responsible for catalyzing dihydroorotate to orotate (5). Interruption of pyrimidine
synthesis impairs nucleic acid production and leads to the arrest of hyphal extension.
The modal MIC against Aspergillus fumigatus (including triazole-wild-type and -resistant
strains) is 0.03 mg/liter.
Herein, we describe the pharmacodynamics of F901318 against Aspergillus fumiga-
tus as a first critical step for the identification of candidate human regimens for
early-phase clinical studies. We have recently considered the strategy and steps that
constitute an adequate preclinical pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) pack-
age for new antifungal agents (6) and have used this as a template for the development
of F901318. A deep understanding of PK-PD relationships is required to lower the risks
in clinical development programs. The use of a regimen that is too low increases the
risk of concentration-dependent therapeutic failure, while an excessive dose may
increase the probability of toxicity. In either case, failure to select the right regimen
places the entire developmental program in jeopardy. Pharmacodynamics is a way that
the risks in development programs can be reduced (6).
RESULTS
Murine model of IPA. A well-characterized and severe neutropenic murine model
of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) was used (7). The severity was the same
regardless of the different challenge strains of Aspergillus fumigatus used (the strains are
summarized in Table 1). The first signs of morbidity appeared 36 to 48 h postinocula-
tion. Mice experienced progressive weight loss throughout the experiment. Mortality
began after 3 to 4 days and, without specific antifungal therapy, was nearly 100% after
7 days. A 20-mg/kg-of-body-weight dose of posaconazole per day orally was used as a
positive control in all experiments. This regimen had previously been demonstrated to
result in suppression of galactomannan (GM) in murine models of IPA (8).
Tolerability of F901318. Preliminary experiments suggested that the upper toxicity
bound for F901318 in mice was approximately 30 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.). The
administration of this dose as a rapid i.v. push into a tail vein was not tolerated. Hence,
the largest dose that was used in subsequent experiments was 45 mg/kg/day admin-
istered in three divided dosages (i.e., 15 mg/kg every 8 h [q8h]). This regimen was
consistently well tolerated. Higher dosages were also limited by the relative insolubility
of F901318 in water and potential toxicity of the excipients used in the i.v. preparation.
Murine pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetics were linear in the range of 4 to
15 mg/kg q8h. These dosages were studied after preliminary dose-finding experiments
and with the knowledge that they encompassed the relevant portions of the exposure-
response relationship. A standard 2-compartment PK model was fitted to the data. The
mean and median parameter estimates and the associated standard deviation for each

 model parameter are summarized in Table 2. The PK data and the fit of the pharma-
cokinetic model to the data are shown in Fig. 1.
Dose-fractionation studies. Isodose experiments using 24 mg/kg/day demon-
strated striking differences in the antifungal effect of F901318 according to the sched-
ule of drug administration. A regimen of 8 mg/kg F901318 administered every 8 h
resulted in complete suppression of the GM levels throughout the experimental period,
whereas the same total daily dosage administered q24h or q12h resulted in fungal
growth (P � 0.001) (Fig. 2). This pattern of effect was the same regardless of the
susceptibility to triazoles (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material for dose fraction-
ation studies for strain NIH/4215, which is triazole wild type).
During these experiments and PK-PD analyses, it was clear that the total plasma
concentrations of F901318 were always greater than the MIC for both NIH/4215 and
F16216 (i.e., all �0.03 mg/liter). This observation appeared inconsistent with the results
of the dose fractionation experiment, where there was clear evidence of time-dependent
antifungal activity (Fig. 2). Ordinarily, time-dependent antifungal activity is quantified
using the fraction of the dosing interval for which either the total or free drug
concentration is greater than the MIC (9). For F901318, the former was not tenable
because the total plasma drug concentrations were greater than the MIC for 100% of
the dosing interval. The latter was also problematic because of the high protein binding
of F901318 (ca. 99% using equilibrium dialysis). Using free time (fT) � MIC values did
not readily discriminate between the three regimens whose data are shown in Fig. 2
(i.e., the estimates for fT � MIC were surprisingly close for 24 mg/kg q24h, 12 mg/kg
q12h, and 8 mg/kg q8h), and therefore, it could not easily account for the large
differences in antifungal activity that were observed with these different schedules of
drug administration. It is possible that more fractionated regimens might have enabled
relationships between fT � MIC and effect to be established, but this was not possible
with the design that was employed in this study.
Alternative ways of quantifying time-dependent antifungal activity were considered,
and these were as follows: (i) the total drug minimum-concentration–to–MIC ratio
(Cmin/MIC), which is a measure of threshold effect that has been increasingly used in the
resistance literature where biological activity is seen despite drug concentrations being

 persistently greater than the MIC (see reference 10, for example), and (ii) the fraction of
the dosing interval during which plasma concentrations are greater than the MIC
determined in the presence of 40% serum (this value was consistently 1 mg/liter). Thus,
the two measures of the threshold effect that were used to quantify drug exposure
were Cmin/MIC and T � MIC of 1 mg/liter; these are shown in Fig. 3 and also in Fig. S2.
Benchmarking of the activity of F901318 against data for posaconazole. The
pharmacodynamics of posaconazole was studied to better characterize the model’
s
behavior and aid in the interpretation of the antifungal activity of F901318. A mathe-
matical model was fitted to the entire posaconazole data set (see below for details on
the structural model and data shown in the supplemental material). The parameter
values are summarized in Table S1. A posaconazole area under the concentration-time
curve (AUC) of approximately 47 mg ·h/liter in humans represents the upper 95%
confidence bound for the upper quartile for response in patients (11). This same
exposure is achieved with approximately 10 mg/kg in mice and results in a decline of
27% in the area under the GM time curve (Fig. 4).
Pharmacodynamics of F901318 against Aspergillus fumigatus. F901318 expo-
sure induced a dose-dependent decline in GM of triazole-susceptible and triazole-
resistant strains (Fig. 5). The exposure-response relationships were comparable whether
the GM at the end of the experiment (at time � 78 h) or the area under the GM time
curve (from time � 0 to time � 78 h) was used as the primary pharmacodynamic
endpoint. The pharmacodynamics were comparable for triazole-susceptible and
-resistant strains (Fig. 5). The Cmin/MIC values that achieved a 27% reduction in GM (that

two one-half dosages were administered twice (C), and three one-third dosages were administered every 8 h (D). There was a progressively
greater effect, as smaller dosages were administered more frequently. Overall, galactomannan-time profiles were significantly different between
regimens (P � 0.001). Compared to the results for the control, galactomannan profiles over time were significantly different for 12 mg/kg q12h
(P � 0.028) and 8 mg/kg q8h (P � 0.024). No difference was detected for 24 mg/kg q24h versus the controls over time.

Aspergillus fumigatus strains were 3, 5, 6.5, 6.5, 7, 12.5, 15.5, and 16.5 (average Cmin/MIC

Survival studies. Even though it was only administered for 3 days, treatment of
mice with F901318 resulted in survival prolongation at 10 days compared with the
survival of vehicle-treated controls. A regimen of 15 mg/kg q8h approximated the
results observed with posaconazole at 10 mg/kg/day (a clinically relevant maximal drug
exposure; see above) in mice infected with posaconazole-susceptible and -resistant
isolates (Fig. 6). The pattern of survival prolongation induced by F901318 was the same
regardless of the underlying triazole resistance mechanism. In contrast, infection with
isolates with a CYP51A mutation that were resistant to posaconazole (Fig. 6C and D)
resulted in reduced survival in mice receiving posaconazole that was not statistically
different from the survival of vehicle-treated controls.

there is no relationship between Cmax/MIC and the observed antifungal effect. (C and D) Similarly, the data suggest there is no relationship between
AUC/MIC and the observed antifungal effect. (E to H) In contrast, there is a striking relationship between the total drug Cmin/MIC versus effect (E and
F), as well as the fractions of the dosing interval plasma concentrations that are �1 mg/liter and the antifungal effect (G and H). These analyses suggest
that there is a strong threshold effect (or time-dependent) antifungal activity that is exhibited by F901318.

 Histopathology studies in mice. Mice were infected with NIH/4215 and treated
with vehicle, posaconazole at 10 mg/kg/day orally, or F901318 at 15 mg/kg q8h (Fig. 7).
In vehicle controls, there was a progressive fungal bronchopneumonia. At 6 h postin-
oculation, rare conidia were identified within pulmonary macrophages, within large
airways, and on the luminal surface of the respiratory epithelium. There was no
evidence of active inflammation or necrosis. At 30 h, there was a mild necrotizing
bronchopneumonia characterized by multifocal necrosis, hemorrhage, edema, and
histiocytic neutrophilic inflammation extending from the bronchi into the terminal
bronchioles and alveolar space. Angioinvasion was present, with associated necrosis
and inflammation of the vascular wall and/or thrombosis. At 54 h, infection was
fulminant and characterized by severe inflammation, necrosis, hemorrhage, edema,
necrotizing vasculitis, and vascular invasion. The histopathological findings at 78 h were
similar in character and severity to those identified at 54 h.

triazole-wild-type strains (defined phenotypically), and the grey lines are the data for triazole-resistant
mutants (defined phenotypically and genotypically). As the Cmin/MIC increases, there is a progressively
greater antifungal effect, as evidenced by lower GM levels at the end of the experiment. Using a target
of 27% reduction in the area under the galactomannan-time curve (which corresponds to the effect
induced by a posaconazole AUC of 47 mg ·h/liter), the F901318 Cmin and Cmin/MIC from the 8 strains were
0.27 mg/liter and 9.07, respectively. There was considerable strain-to-strain variability in the pharmaco-
dynamics of F901318.

 In mice treated with 10 mg/kg posaconazole, the fungal density was reduced
compared with that in controls and hyphae were contained within areas of pyogranu-
lomatous inflammation. Consistent with its lack of effect on GM, a dose of F901318 at
24 mg/kg q24 had a minimal effect compared with that in controls. The use of a higher
dose of 15 mg/kg q8h resulted in appearances similar to those in mice receiving
posaconazole. However, minimal or mild pulmonary hemorrhage, edema, and/or vas-
cular thrombosis persisted in this dose group, suggesting some unresolved vascular
damage. Hyphae were contained by pyogranulomatous inflammation.
Rabbit model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The oral administration of
F901318 induced dose-dependent declines in serum GM in rabbits. In 6 of 18
rabbits, the baseline GM (i.e., GM prior to inoculation of conidia) was strongly positive
(�3) and did not fluctuate throughout the experimental period, suggesting that
readings were falsely positive. The pharmacodynamic data from these rabbits were
excluded (because they was uninterpretable), although the pharmacokinetic data were
available and used for PK-PD modeling.
The mathematical model fit the PK-PD data well. The parameter estimates are
summarized in Table S1. The mathematical model was used to calculate the Cmin value,
the area under the GM time curve, and the GM at the end of the experimental period
for each rabbit. The relationships between Cmin (as the relevant pharmacodynamic
measure of drug exposure defined in mice) and the two measures of pharmacodynamic

New antifungal agents are urgently required for clinical use. There are simply too

 care. As is the case with many anti-Aspergillus compounds, F901318 is relatively
insoluble in water and highly protein bound (ca. 99%). Nevertheless, there are several
highly attractive features that suggest this new compound can address an unmet
medical need: it is orally bioavailable, active against triazole-resistant fungi, and has
potent in vitro activity against rare neglected fungal pathogens. The principal purpose
of this preclinical PK-PD study was to provide a rigorous justification of the antifungal
regimens for the very first patients with invasive fungal infections. Such an approach is
new for antifungal therapeutics. It reduces guesswork, prevents targeting an arbitrarily
chosen plasma concentration value like the MIC, and guides decision-making in
early-clinical-phase development programs.
The orotomides are the first new class of antifungal agent to be discovered for 3
decades. They were initially discovered by screening a large compound library against
Aspergillus fumigatus, rather than the more commonly used Candida albicans. An
understanding of the mechanism of action was established via a combination of

 microbiological, genetic, and biochemical approaches that are described in detail
elsewhere (5). Briefly, the principal strategy was to identify genes that when present in
multiple copies confer resistance to F901318. Extra copies of the gene pyrE, which
encodes dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), confer resistance to F901318. Fur-
thermore, disruption of this gene returned the in vitro susceptibility to wild-type levels.
F901318 inhibits human DHODH but is approximately �2,200-fold less active against
the human enzyme than the fungal one. As expected, there is no evidence of cross-
resistance with other commonly encountered antifungal resistance mechanisms,
such as mutations in the Cyp51 protein. More surprising, perhaps, is the observation
that resistance is not induced in the laboratory by serial passage in the presence of
the drug (5). These features suggest that F901318 has the potential to be a useful
agent for the treatment of patients with invasive aspergillosis caused by triazole-
resistant Aspergillus spp.
Antifungal pharmacodynamics is a new and rapidly developing field of study.
The past 5 to 10 years have seen considerable progress in terms of developing new
experimental platforms and gaining a more detailed understanding of the behavior of
currently available compounds in those models. In this study, preclinical PK-PD models
of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis provide the underpinning evidence that is required
to identify candidate regimens (i.e., both the dosage and the schedule of administra-
tion) that are likely to be associated with maximal antifungal activity in the clinic.
F901318 demonstrates time-dependent antifungal activity. Regimens that result in
trough concentration (Cmin)-MIC ratios of �10 result in a decline in GM that is greater
than observed with clinically equivalent serum drug exposures of posaconazole. Given
that the modal MIC of F901318 to the strains of Aspergillus fumigatus used in this study
was 0.03 mg/liter, this is equivalent to a total drug Cmin of approximately 0.3 mg/liter.
The rabbit model suggests a lower target, with half-maximal antifungal activity evident
with a Cmin of 0.1 mg/liter. Collectively, therefore, Cmin values of 0.1 to 0.3 are
reasonable and can be used to design human regimens that are safe and effective. If
well tolerated, the use of higher targets may result in additional antifungal activity.
These target values are predicted to result in antifungal activity that matches or
exceeds that induced by other licensed agents for invasive aspergillosis, such as
posaconazole, isavuconazole, and liposomal amphotericin B (8, 12, 13).
The clinical development of F901318 is challenging. There is no possibility of using
the traditional and extensively utilized pathway for the development of antifungal
agents, which begins with studies in esophageal candidiasis before proceeding to
clinical trials in invasive candidiasis and salvage studies in invasive aspergillosis (see, for
example, the clinical development pathway followed for all three echinocandins [14–
16]). Salvage studies are difficult to interpret. Furthermore, the administration of a new
antifungal drug on a backbone with a known active antifungal compound presents a
series of challenges without entirely satisfactory solutions. Hence, new ways of identi-
fying clinical regimens for which the risks are reduced as much as possible for the very
first patients with invasive aspergillosis receiving a new antifungal agent are required.
In this regard, pharmacodynamics has a vital role to play. Antifungal pharmacodynam-
ics is a relatively young discipline but has already made significant contributions to the
setting of in vitro susceptibility breakpoints (8, 17), target selection for therapeutic drug
monitoring (TDM) (18, 19), and dosage selection in special populations (20, 21).
This study has highlighted several issues that are pertinent for the application of
modern pharmacodynamics for antifungal drug development. Some of these issues
have been previously summarized by us (6). First, the importance of experimental
models that are faithful mimics of human disease cannot be overstated. The murine
and rabbit models in this study are both models of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis,
which is the most clinically relevant manifestation of human disease, where �90% of
cases involve the lung (22). The use of two experimental models minimizes the chance
of an aberrant result due to species-specific idiosyncrasies in pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics. Second, we focused intently on establishing the study endpoints
that are potentially clinically relevant by benchmarking against licensed comparators.

 Third, we used both wild-type strains and strains with reduced susceptibility to triazoles
to demonstrate that the pharmacodynamics of F901318 is not affected by the under-
lying triazole resistance mechanism.
In conclusion, F901318 is a new antifungal agent with activity against Aspergillus
fumigatus, including strains that are resistant to the triazoles. A detailed understanding
of the pharmacodynamics of F901318 provides the underpinning evidence and ratio-
nale to enable the further study of this compound for patients with life-threatening
invasive fungal infections with few or no other therapeutic options.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Challenge strain(s) of Aspergillus fumigatus. The pharmacodynamics of F901318 was determined
using eight strains of Aspergillus fumigatus. The provenance of these strains is summarized in Table 1.
Strains were triazole wild type (as defined by in vitro susceptibility testing; n � 4) and triazole resistant
(as defined by in vitro susceptibility testing and sequencing of the Cyp51A gene; n � 4). MICs were
determined over the course of multiple independently conducted experiments using both EUCAST and
CLSI methodology.
For all strains, Aspergillus fumigatus conidia were prepared by subculturing on Sabouraud dextrose
agar with chloramphenicol (Sigma-Aldrich, United Kingdom). Plates were incubated at 37°
C for at least
5 days. To harvest conidia, the surface of the flask was gently irrigated with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) with 0.05% Tween 80 and the resultant mixture centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in PBS
with 0.05% Tween 80. Conidia were washed through gauze, and the suspension progressively diluted to
achieve a density of 1 � 107 CFU/ml. The suspension was used immediately for inoculation.
Murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Male CD1 mice were purchased from Charles
River, Inc., and rested for 1 week prior to experimentation. Mice were housed in individually vented cages
(IVCs) with 3 animals per cage and weighed 25 to 30 g at the time of experimentation. Food and water
were provided ad libitum. All experiments were conducted under UK Home Office license PPL 40/3630
and approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body of the University of Liverpool.
Mice were rendered neutropenic with intraperitoneal injection of 150 mg/kg cyclophosphamide on
day �4 and 100 mg/kg on day �1 relative to the time of infection. Mice were further immunosuppressed
with cortisone acetate (250 mg/kg) given subcutaneously on day �1 relative to the time of infection to
impair the function of pulmonary alveolar macrophages.
The fungal inoculum was prepared as described above. Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane.
A conidial suspension of 5 � 105 CFU/ml (50 �l/mouse of the 1 � 107 CFU/ml inoculum) was instilled in
both nares. Treatment with antifungal agents was delayed for 6 h postinoculation. Mice were treated
throughout the experimental period with vehicle control (i.v.), various regimens of F901318 (i.v.), or
posaconazole at 10 or 20 mg/kg orally. The treatment duration was 72 h, meaning that the entire
experimental duration was 78 h (6-h treatment delay followed by 72 h of antifungal therapy).
Study drugs. F901318 for i.v. injection was prepared in the following way. The desired amount of
drug was weighed, added to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and vortexed until fully dissolved. Subse-
quently, polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) was added and the mixture vortexed. A solution of 35.3%
hydroxyl propyl � cyclodextrin (HPBCD) was prepared in water. The solution of F901318 in DMSO-PEG
and the HPBCD solution were mixed to give a clear solution. The final excipient concentrations were
30% HPCD, 5% DMSO, and 10% PEG 400. Appropriate volumes of F901318 were prepared and stored
at �20°
C for daily use. Prior to use, drug-containing vials were fully thawed and vortexed. An oral
suspension of posaconazole (Noxafil; Merck, Inc., USA) was used and diluted with 20% HPBCD (4 g HPBCD
in 20 ml water) as previously described (8).
Measurement of F901318. The F901318 concentrations in murine plasma were measured using
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a Shimadzu Prominence instrument (Shimadzu,
Milton Keynes, United Kingdom). The F901318 method used a 50- by 2.0-mm Synergi 4-�m Max RP 80A
column (Phenomenex, Macclesfield, United Kingdom) and a 40-�l injection volume. A standard curve
encompassing 0.01 to 20 mg/liter was constructed from stock solutions of F901318 at 1,000 mg/liter in
DMSO that were further diluted in methanol (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, United Kingdom).
The internal standard was F901351 (F2G, Eccles, United Kingdom), which is a member of the
orotomide antifungal class. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a gradient with the starting
condition of 80:20 (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid [TFA] in water as mobile phase A and 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile
as mobile phase B). Mobile phase B was increased to 50% over 3 min and to 65% B over minutes 3 to
5 and then reduced to the starting condition for 2.5 min of equilibration, all at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.
F901318 and F901351 were detected using UV detection with 250-nm and 270-nm wavelengths;
they eluted after 4.9 and 1.9 min, respectively. The coefficient of variation (CV%) was �12.4% over
the concentration range of 0.01 to 20 mg/liter. The limit of detection was 0.01 mg/liter. The intra-
and interday variation was �8.2%. The assay was separately validated for rabbit plasma. The CV%
was �10.4% over the concentration range of 0.05 to 20 mg/liter. The limit of detection was 0.05 mg/liter.
The intra- and interday variation was �9.1%.
Pharmacokinetics. The plasma PK of F901318 was determined in two independently conducted
experiments. Plasma drug concentrations were measured as described above. Three regimens were
studied (with prior knowledge that these regimens encompassed relevant drug exposures at which
antifungal activity was observed; see “Pharmacodynamics,” below). Regimens of 4 mg/kg q8h, 8 mg/kg
q8h, and 15 mg/kg q8h i.v. were studied. Sampling was performed in the first dose interval from 0 to 8 h

 and then later between 54 and 62 h. Plasma was collected at 2, 4, and 8 h postdose, with the predose
concentration being collected at 54 h. Three mice were studied at every dosage time point. Mice were
terminally anesthetized using 2% isoflurane. Blood was obtained via cardiac puncture, placed in
heparinized tubes, and immediately placed on ice before being centrifuged. The plasma was removed
and stored at �80°
C until future analysis.
Dose fractionation studies and elucidation of the pharmacodynamic index best linking drug
exposure with antifungal effect. Three experimental pieces of evidence were used to elucidate the
relevant pharmacodynamic index: (i) dose fractionation studies using triazole-wild-type strain NIH/4215
as the challenge strain and GM as the experimental read out; (ii) dose fractionation studies using an
Aspergillus fumigatus TR34/L98H mutant (bearing a change of L to H at position 98) as the challenge
strain and GM as the experimental read out; and (iii) a series of survival studies using strains NIH/4215
(triazole wild type), AF210 (triazole wild type), 16216 (a TR34/L98H mutant that has reduced susceptibility
to triazoles), and 11628 (a G138C mutant [bearing a change of G to C at position 138] that is triazole
resistant). In both mutants, the mutation affects the Cyp51A protein, which is the common target site for
the triazole antifungal class.
The mathematical PK-PD model was used to transform drug exposure quantified in terms of the
mouse (i.e., mg/kg) to measures made in terms of the invading fungal pathogen in the mouse (i.e., AUC,
peak concentration, and fraction of the dosing interval plasma concentration were above threshold).
These measures were then related to the MIC of the invading pathogen to generate AUC/MIC, Cmax/MIC,
and T � MIC ratios. The antifungal effect of F901318 was measured by estimating both the area under
the GM time curve and the GM at the end of the experiment. Different measures of drug exposure of
F901318 (i.e., AUC/MIC, peak concentration/MIC, and fraction of the dosing interval drug concentration
were greater than the MIC) were determined, and any possible relationship with both the area under the
GM-time curve and the GM at the end of the experiment was explored by fitting inhibitory sigmoid
maximum effect (Emax) models to the data using nonlinear regression and the ADAPT 5 program (23).
The relevant pharmacodynamic index was assessed using dose fractionation studies in which a total
daily dose of F901318 was administered as a single full dose administered once per day, two one-half
dosages every 12 h, and three one-third dosages every 8 h. Preliminary dose-finding experiments were
used to define the relevant areas of the exposure-response relationship where PD relationships could be
elucidated. This therapeutic window proved to be relatively narrow. The administration of regimens
comprising �24 mg/kg/day resulted in submaximal antifungal activity, whereas the administration
of �24 mg/kg/day resulted in nearly maximal antifungal activity. In either case, the different antifungal
activities of the various regimens could not be demonstrated. Hence, a single total daily dosage of
24 mg/kg/day was used for these experiments. The three fractionated regimens were 24 mg/kg/day
q24h, 12 mg/kg/day q12h, and 8 mg/kg q8h (all administered intravenously). A regression model was
fitted to the data with the time � drug interaction term to determine the effects of different schedules
of administration on the antifungal effect.
Three experimental pieces were used to elucidate the relevant PD index: (i) dose fractionation studies
using triazole-wild-type NIH/4215 as the challenge strain and GM as the experimental read out; (ii) dose
fractionation studies using an Aspergillus fumigatus TR34/L98H mutant as the challenge strain and GM as
the experimental read out; and (iii) a series of survival studies using NIH/4215 (triazole wild type), AF210
(triazole wild type), 16216 (a TR34/L98H mutant that is triazole resistant), and 11628 (a G138C mutant
that is triazole resistant).
Benchmarking against posaconazole. As with any model, the experimental conditions used for the
murine model of IPA were designed to produce “on-scale” readouts following antifungal therapy (i.e.,
clinically relevant drug exposures produce effects somewhere between none and maximal). The exper-
imental conditions are such that not all regimens exert maximal antifungal effect or produce nothing at
all. The challenge strain, inoculum, immunosuppression, and time to initiation of antifungal therapy all
have an impact on the observed exposure-response relationships. Thus, the potential clinical significance
of a decline of a biomarker induced by a new antifungal agent must be placed in some clinically relevant
context. We used a previous study that examined the pharmacodynamics for posaconazole for IPA to
calibrate the model’
s behavior (8).
Exposure-response relationships for F901318 and magnitude of the pharmacodynamic target
associated with maximal antifungal activity. The pharmacodynamics of F901318 against various
strains of Aspergillus fumigatus (Table 1) was determined over the course of multiple independently
conducted experiments. The same neutropenic model of IPA described above was used for each strain.
A variety of regimens informed by preliminary dose-finding studies were used in these experiments. All
experiments included a positive-control cohort of mice that received 20 mg/kg/day posaconazole by
gavage. Such a regimen results in drug exposure that is significantly greater than that achievable in the
clinic and routinely resulted in completely suppressed GM profiles.
Survival studies. Two triazole-wild-type strains (NIH/4215 and AF210) and two triazole-resistant
strains were studied (strain 16216, a TR34/mutant, and strain 11628, a G138C mutant). Details of these
strains are provided in Table 1. The neutropenic murine model of IPA described above was used but was
adapted for survival studies. Each cohort consisted of 10 mice. F901318 was administered as 24 mg q24h,
8 mg/kg q8h, and 15 mg/kg q8h i.v. for 3 days, after which treatment was stopped and mice were
observed. Posaconazole at 10 mg/kg/day orally was used as a comparator for these experiments. At this
dose, posaconazole produces an AUC from 0 to 24 h (AUC0�24) of �50 mg ·h/liter in mice, which is just
above the upper 95% confidence interval for the fourth quartile of clinical response for patients with
invasive aspergillosis receiving posaconazole as salvage therapy (11). For reference, the average expo-

 sures in the upper quartile of response are approximately 30 mg ·h/liter. Mice were sacrificed if they
reached predetermined endpoints that suggested death was imminent.
Histopathology studies. Sections of lung were fixed in 10% formaldehyde and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (HE) or Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) stain.
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mathematical modeling. Several PK-PD models were
fitted to the data. For the PK data considered in isolation, a two-compartment PK model best described
the PK data, with time-delimited zero-order input and first-order elimination from the central compart-
ment. All models were fitted to the data using the population pharmacokinetic program Pmetrics (24).
In these analyses, an “individual” consisted of a cohort of mice receiving a given regimen.
The combined PK-PD datasets (i.e., concentrations of F901318 and corresponding GM data) were
modeled using a linked PK-PD mathematical model, which took the following form:

and had output equations Y(1) � X(1)/V and Y(2) � X(3). X is the amount of drug in a compartment, R(1)
represents the i.v. injection of F901318, SCL (liter/h) is the clearance of drug from the central compart-
ment, and V(liter) is the volume of the central compartment. Kcp (h�1) and Kpc (h�1) are the first-order
intercompartmental rate constants connecting the central (c) and peripheral (p) compartments, and
Kgmax (GM/h) and kkill
max (GM/h) are the maximal rates of fungal growth and drug-induced kill,
respectively. Popmax (GM) is the maximum theoretical fungal density, C50g (mg/liter) and C50k (mg/liter)
are the concentrations of F901318 (or posaconazole) that induce half-maximal effects on growth and kill,
respectively, and Hg and Hk are the respective slope functions for growth and kill. The initial condition
(GM; not shown in the equations) is the fungal density immediately following inoculation and is
estimated along with other parameters.
Equations 1 and 2 are standard pharmacokinetic equations that describe a 2-compartment PK model
with first-order clearance of drug from the central compartment. The pharmacodynamics of F901318 (or
posaconazole) against Aspergillus fumigatus is described by equation 3, which has terms that describe the
capacity-limited growth of Aspergillus, drug-induced suppression of growth, and drug-induced fungal
killing. The first output equation provides the concentration-time profile of F901318, while the second
provides the time course of GM. Both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles can be
integrated to provide the area under the concentration-time and GM time curves. For posaconazole, an
additional equation describing the absorption of drug from the gut following oral administration was
used.
The model was fitted to the data using Pmetrics (24). An “individual” consisted of a cohort of mice
with the same experimental conditions.
Rabbit model of IPA. The pharmacodynamics of F901318 were further studied in a well-characterized
neutropenic rabbit model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. This model has been used to study most
of the currently licensed antifungal agents, including posaconazole, isavuconazole, and various formu-
lations of amphotericin B (12, 13, 25).
Rabbits received F901318 by oral gavage using a spray-dried dispersion. The dosing formulation was
prepared as follows. Prepared component A was 0.552 g sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate
(molecular weight [MW] � 137.99) in 100 g ultrahigh purity (UHP) water. Prepared component B was
1.072 g disodium hydrogen phosphate heptahydrate (MW � 268.03) in 100 g UHP water. Forty-millimolar
phosphate buffer was made by mixing 23.6 g of component A and 76.4 g of component B. The pH of
the buffer was monitored and adjusted with each component as necessary until a pH of 7.4 � 0.1 was
achieved. Foil pouches containing 10% F901318 and 90% hypromellose acetate succinate (HPMCAS)
were stored at 4°
C and allowed to reach room temperature before opening. The desired amount of drug
was weighed out (with F901318 comprising 10% of the weight of the powder), added to the required
volume of 40 mM phosphate buffer, and vortexed until dissolved. The F901318 oral formulation was
mixed before dosing and used within an hour of preparation.
A Silastic intravenous indwelling catheter was placed in each animal. Rabbits were immunosup-
pressed with 525 mg/m2 cytosine arabinoside on day �1 relative to inoculation, and 5 mg/kg methyl-
prednisolone was administered on day �1 and day zero. Opportunistic systemic bacterial infections were
prevented with 15 mg/kg/day vancomycin, 5 mg/kg gentamicin every second day, and 75 mg/kg
ceftazidime twice daily. Rabbits were inoculated via the endobronchial instillation of 1 � 108 conidia
from Aspergillus fumigatus NIH/4215 in 0.25 ml. The model read out was the serum concentration of GM
as previously described in this model (13, 25, 26).
Rabbits received F901318 (0.5, 2.5, 10, and 20 mg/kg q12h) or vehicle control by oral gavage. These
regimens were designed after preliminary tolerability and pharmacokinetic studies (data not shown). The

 ensuing drug exposure was assessed in the context of the conclusions of the murine studies described
above. There were four animals per group. Treatment started 24 h postinoculation and continued for
7 days before all rabbits were sacrificed via the i.v. injection of pentobarbitone. (i.e., 192 h postinocu-
lation.) Serum GM concentrations were determined on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 in study 1 and days �1,
0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8 in study 2. The pharmacokinetics of F901318 was estimated after the first dosing
interval on days 1 and 8.
Data analysis and mathematical modeling of PK-PD data from the rabbit model. The same
structural mathematical model described for mice was used for rabbits, except that an absorptive
compartment was added to enable the transit of drug from the gut to the bloodstream to be described.
Each rabbit was treated as an individual in this analysis. The Bayesian estimates for the PK-PD
parameters from each rabbit were obtained and used to estimate the Cmin and both the area under
the GM time curve for each rabbit and the GM at the end of the experiment. The relationship between
drug exposure and the decline in the biomarker was then described using an inhibitory sigmoid Emax
model.
