Abstract.
Background: We evaluated the effects of low doses of the tyrosine kinase Abelson (Abl) inhibitor Nilotinib, on safety and
pharmacokinetics in Parkinson’s disease dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies.
Objectives: The primary outcomes of this study were safety and tolerability; pharmacokinetics and target engagement were
secondary, while clinical outcomes were exploratory.
Methods: Twelve subjects were randomized into 150 mg (n = 5) or 300 mg (n = 7) groups and received Nilotinib orally every
day for 24 weeks.
Results: This study shows that 150 mg and 300 mg doses of Nilotinib appear to be safe and tolerated in subjects with
advanced Parkinson’s disease. Nilotinib is detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and seems to engage the target Abl.
Motor and cognitive outcomes suggest a possible beneficial effect on clinical outcomes. The CSF levels of homovanillic acid
are significantly increased between baseline and 24 weeks of treatment. Exploratory CSF biomarkers were measured.
Conclusions: This small proof-of-concept study lacks a placebo group and participants were not homogenous, resulting in
baseline differences between and within groups. This limits the interpretations of the biomarker and clinical data, and any
conclusions should be drawn cautiously. Nonetheless, the collective observations suggest that it is warranted to evaluate the
safety and efficacy of Nilotinib in larger randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.

INTRODUCTION
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most com-
mon neurodegenerative disorder that causes motor
and non-motor symptoms. PD is characterized by
loss of dopamine (DA)-producing neurons in the
substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta and formation
of intracellular inclusions known as Lewy bodies
(LBs) that primarily contain aggregated �-synuclein.
Evidence suggests that autophagy is impaired in
neurodegenerative disorders, including PD [1–8];
leading to accumulation and propagation of mis-
folded �-synuclein and SN neuronal degeneration. A
major challenge is to develop a therapy that can halt
loss of DA neurons in SN and alleviate progressive
motor and non-motor symptoms.
Nilotinib
(Tasigna®,
AMN107,
Novartis,
Switzerland) is a Break point cluster (BCR)-
Abl (Abelson) tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved
by the U.S. FDA for adults with chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML) at oral doses of 600–800 mg daily
[9–11]. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors induce autophagy
[12–14] to destroy rapidly dividing tumor cells in
CML [12]. We previously demonstrated that a low
dose of Nilotinib (1–10 mg/kg daily) penetrates the
blood brain barrier (BBB) and degrades misfolded
�-synuclein via autophagy [13, 15–17]. Nilotinib
also increases DA levels and improves motor and
cognitive outcomes in PD and Alzheimer’s disease
models [13, 14, 18–20]. In preclinical studies,
Nilotinib enters the brain and inhibits Abl, leading
to reduction of oxidative stress and protection of
DA neurons [13, 21–24]. The rationale behind
this study is based on extensive preclinical labo-
ratory findings [12–14, 19–22]. We administered
late-stage PD and DLB patients doses of Nilotinib
that are commercially available and substantially
lower (150 mg or 300 mg daily) than those used in
oncology (600–800 mg daily). Based on preclinical
studies we hypothesized that Nilotinib would enter
the brain and inhibit Abl in PD and DLB patients.
We conducted a pilot open label proof-of-concept
study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Nilo-
tinib in participants with advanced PD with dementia
(PDD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Our
primary objective is to demonstrate that low oral
daily doses of 150 mg or 300 mg Nilotinib (com-
pared to 600–800 mg in cancer) are safe and tolerated.
Our secondary objectives are to assess whether
orally administered Nilotinib crosses the BBB and
inhibits CSF Abl. Based on preclinical data we also
hypothesized that Nilotinib will increase DA levels.
Motor and cognitive functions were also measured
as exploratory clinical outcomes. Other exploratory
outcomes are that Nilotinib may alter PD-related CSF
biomarkers DJ-1 and �-synuclein. As most partici-
pants in this study had dementia we also explored the
effects of Nilotinib on AD-related CSF biomarkers,
including A�40 and A�42, total tau and phosphory-
lated tau (p-tau).
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Study design
Twelve PDD or DLB participants with parkinso-
nian Hoehn and Yahr stage 3–5 were randomized
into 150 mg (n = 5) or 300 mg (n = 7) groups and
received oral daily doses of Nilotinib for 24 weeks
with 12 weeks follow up (Fig. 1). Diagnosis of PD
was according to the UK Brain Bank Diagnostic Cri-
teria. Diagnostic criteria for probable DLB included
the presence of dementia and at least two of three
other symptoms, including fluctuating attention and
concentration, visual hallucinations and parkinsonian
motor signs. Participants were stable on L-Dopa
treatment and other PD medications for four weeks
prior to study enrollment as indicated in Table 1.
Participants on stable treatment (>4 weeks) with
monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor Selegeline
up to 10 mg/day or Rasagiline up to 1 mg/day were
enrolled. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)
in the range of 18–26 was used at screening to
determine cognitive impairment (MCI), moderate
dementia (17–10) and severe dementia (<10) in PD
and DLB patients, respectively. This is the first clin-
ical study to examine the effects of the cancer drug
Nilotinib in the PD population. We selected PDD or
DLB patients to evaluate safety and tolerability in this
population and excluded co-morbidities including
myocardial, hematological and hepatic abnormali-
ties, resulting in a high number of screen failures.
PDD or DLB participants who were enrolled also had
cognitive symptoms, and this was not an exclusion
criterion as our preclinical data suggest that Nilo-
tinib may improve cognitive performance in animal
models.
The primary objective was to determine the safety
and tolerability of daily Nilotinib for 6 months. Elec-
trocardiograms (EKGs), physical and neurological
exams and blood draws for laboratory chemistry
were performed every two weeks for the first two
months, and every month thereafter. Patients with
cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarcts, QTc

interval >450 ms and those who are on drugs that
prolong QTc or taking exclusionary medications
(i.e. coumadin) were not enrolled. Thirty patients
were screened and twelve were enrolled and most
screen failures were subjects who had QTc>450 ms.
The secondary objectives were to determine whether
Nilotinib crosses the BBB and whether it affects
phosphorylation of Abl in CSF samples. Nilo-
tinib concentration was measured in plasma and
CSF at baseline (before treatment) at two months
(interim) and six months treatment. Pharmacody-
namic analyses were performed to determine target
engagement via measurement of CSF phosphory-
lated Abl. Other exploratory markers associated with
neurodegeneration, including CSF �-synuclein, DJ-
1, DA metabolite HVA, total tau and p-tau181, A�42
and A�40, Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE) and glial
and neuronal marker S100B were also measured.
Tertiary/exploratory clinical outcomes included mea-
surement of motor and non-motor symptoms using
Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)
I-IV. Nilotinib effects on progression of demen-
tia were evaluated using the Mini Mental State
Examination (MMSE) and Scales for Outcomes in
Parkinson’s disease-Cognition (SCOPA-Cog). The
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS)
was performed at every visit.
Screening and enrollment
Participants and study partners were consented
prior to any study-related procedures. Demograph-
ics, concurrent medications, and medical history
were gathered from the participant and study partner
(Table 1). Patients who could not give consent were
consented by a legally authorized representative.
Vital signs were recorded with comprehensive phys-
ical and neurological examinations. Randomization
was performed via an internet based randomization
module and subjects were assigned to one of the 2

treatment groups. The chance for randomization to
the groups was 1:1 for 150 mg:300 mg Nilotinib.
Safety monitoring
Physical and neurological exams and EKGs were
performed with laboratory blood chemistry, includ-
ing total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL),
high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride, phos-
phate, total bilirubin, calcium, chloride, sodium,
potassium, magnesium, lipase, �-amylase, alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotrans-
ferase (AST). A standard hematology panel included
complete blood count with differential for white
blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin, hematocrit and
platelets.
Baseline
This visit was scheduled 2–4 weeks after screen-
ing and results from all screening procedures were
reviewed for inclusion/exclusion criteria. CSF was
collected via lumbar puncture and blood draws
were performed for biomarker measurements. Blood
biomarker samples were collected 30 minutes before
CSF collection. Vital signs, brief physical and neu-
rological examination along with documentation of
concurrent medications and reviewed AEs were per-
formed at every visit.
Plasma and CSF collection
Blood draw (15 ml) and lumbar puncture (∼15 ml
CSF) were performed on all patients at baseline, 2
and 6-months treatment. Collection was obtained at
1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 hrs after Nilotinib administration by
mouth. Plasma was isolated immediately after blood
draw and aliquoted and stored at –80◦C. CSF was
aliquoted and stored at –80◦C. Freeze/thaw cycles
were avoided. To avoid CSF contamination with
blood, the first 1 mL of CSF collection was dis-
carded and all samples were centrifuged at 1000 g
for 15 minutes. Samples that contained >25 ng/ml
Hemoglobin were eliminated and were not tested
for biomarkers. The hemoglobin levels in CSF sam-
ples were measured using human hemoglobin ELISA

turer’s instructions.
Mass spectrometry to evaluate Nilotinib
pharmacokinetics
Plasma and CSF samples (20 �l) were thawed
initially on ice at room temperature and trans-
ferred to Eppendorf tubes containing 100 �l of water.
Extraction solvent (500 �l) Acetonitrile/Methanol
(50:50) containing the internal standard (5 ng/mL
of Nilotinib 13C 2H3) was added to the sample.
The mixture was vortexed and incubated for 20 min
on ice to accelerate protein precipitation and dial-
ysis through 25 �m membranes was performed to
obtain unbound Nilotinib. After incubation, the sam-
ples were vortexed and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for
20 min at 4◦C. The supernatant containing unbound
Nilotinib was freeze-dried using speed vacuum and
reconstituted in 200 �L of Methanol: Water (50:50)
and processed by mass spectrometry.
The samples were resolved on an Acquity UPLC
BEH C18 1.7 �m, 2.1 × 50 mm column online with
a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Xevo-TQ-S,
Waters Corporation, USA) operating in the multiple
reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The instrument
parameters were optimized to gain maximum speci-
ficity and sensitivity of ionization for the parent
[m/z = 530.27 (Nilotinib), 438.25 and daughter ions
[m/z = 289.01 (Nilotinib) using “IntelliStart” feature
of MassLynx software (Waters Corporation, USA).
The metabolite ratios were calculated by normaliz-
ing the peak area of endogenous metabolites within
tissue samples normalized to the internal standard
Nilotinib 13C 2H3.
Phospho-Abl (pan-tyrosine) enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
PathScan® pan-tyrosine phospho-Abl solid phase
sandwich ELISA was performed on the same CSF
and plasma samples that were used for Nilotinib mea-
surement in CSF. Abl rabbit antibody was coated
on the microwells and 100 �l CSF or plasma was
incubated for 2 hrs at 37◦C. Bcr-Abl and Abl pro-
tein (phospho and nonphospho) were captured by the
coated antibody. All samples at baseline, 2 months
and 6 months were analyzed side-by-side using same
reagents. After washing, a pan-tyrosine phosphory-
lated Abl detection antibody was added to each well
to detect captured tyrosine-phosphorylated Bcr-Abl
and Abl protein. Samples were incubated with detec-
tion antibody for 1 hr at 37◦C. After washing, anti-
mouse IgG, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked
antibody was added and incubated for 10 min at 37◦C
to recognize the bound detection antibody. The mag-
nitude of the absorbance for developed color is pro-
portional to the quantity of tyrosine-phosphorylated
Bcr-Abl and Abl protein in the samples.
α-synuclein measurement
Solid
phase
�-synuclein
sandwich
ELISA
(Cat#SIG38974, Biolegend) was performed on
CSF and plasma. To avoid freeze-thaw cycles,
immediately after LP and blood draws, 15 mL CSF
and 5 mL plasma were aliquoted on ice into 0.5 mL
tubes and stored at –80◦C. Fresh aliquots were used
to perform ELISA. All samples at baseline, 2 months
and 6 months were analyzed side-by-side using
same reagents. Total �-synuclein rabbit monoclonal
antibody (amino acids 118–123) was coated on the
microwells and 200 �l CSF or plasma was added
to designated wells. CSF samples were diluted
1:10 while plasma samples were diluted 1:50. After
overnight sample incubation at 4◦C, �-synuclein was
captured by the coated antibody. After washing, a
biotinylated mouse monoclonal �-synuclein (amino
acids 103–107) detection antibody was added to
each well to detect the captured �-synuclein (amino
acids 118–123). Samples were incubated with 50 �l
of detection antibody for 2 hrs at room temperature.
After washing, 200 �l of streptavidin HRP was
added and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature to
recognize the bound biotinylated detection antibody.
Samples were then washed and incubated with
100 �l of chemiluminescent substrates. Plates were
shaken for 10–15 seconds and read immediately by
a luminometer.
HVA measurement
A 100 �l CSF and plasma samples were incubated
with 100 �l HRP-conjugate reagent and incubated
for 1 hr at 37◦C using solid phase sandwich ELISA
(MyBioSource, Cat# MBS064661). All samples at
baseline, 2 months and 6 months were analyzed
side-by-side using same reagents. After washing,
50 �l of chromogen solution A and 50 �l of chro-
mogen solution B were added to the solution and
incubated for 15 min at 37◦C. The reaction was
stopped with 50 �l stop solution and the optical den-
sity was read at 450 nM. The magnitude of the
 508

absorbance is proportional to the quantity of CSF
HVA.
Human neurodegenerative disease magnetic
bead panels
A multiplex Xmap technology that uses magnetic
microspheres internally coded with two fluorescent
dyes was used to measure markers of neurodegener-
ation. All samples at baseline, 2 months and 6 months
were analyzed side-by-side using same reagents.
Through precise combinations of these two dyes,
multiple proteins are measured within the sample.
Each of these spheres is coated with a specific cap-
ture antibody. The capture antibody binds to the
detection antibody and a reporter molecule, complet-
ing the reaction on the surface of the bead. 25 �L
of CSF or plasma was incubated overnight at 4◦C
with 25 �L of a mixed bead solution, containing
human NSE and DJ-1 (Millipore, Cat#: HND1MAG-
39K) or S100B, total tau, p-tau181, A�42, and A�40
(CSF A�40 is diluted 1:10). After washing, sam-
ples were incubated with 25 �L detection antibody
solution for 1.5 hrs at room temperature (Millipore,
CAT#: HND4MAG-36K), 25 �L of Streptavidin-
Phycoerythrin was added to each well containing the
25 �l of detection antibody solution. Samples were
then washed and suspended in 100 �l of sheath fluid.
Samples were then run on MAGPIX with Xponent
software. The Median Fluorescent Intensity (MFI)
data was analyzed using a 5- parameter logistic or
spline curve-fitting method for calculating analyte
concentrations in samples.
Statistical data analysis
Dataaresummarizedasrawvalues,rangeasappro-
priate, and mean ± SD for n = 5 in 150 mg group and
n = 7 in 300 mg group, unless otherwise indicated.
All graphs and statistical analyses were performed in
Graph Pad Prism Software version 5.01 (Graph Pad
Prism Software, Inc. CA. USA). To account for large
differences between groups at baseline, all estimates
used for means and SD were based on mean of rel-
ative changes- not the mean value changes. As each
group has less than 10 subjects and the normality of
biomarkers is unclear, non-parametric tests such as
Wilcoxon signed test and Mann-Whitney test were
performed to compare between baseline, two and six
months treatment with Nilotinib for both 150 mg and
300 mg treatment groups for biomarkers. As non-
parametric tests may be underpowered, a two tailed
paired t-test was also used to examine differences
between baseline and six months treatment with Nilo-
tinibforboth150 mgand300 mgtreatmentgroupsfor
biomarkers and clinical outcomes. The significance
level was adjusted using the Bonferroni correction.
The sample size n and p-values from each test are
indicated in each table or figure. No comparison is
made in this pilot study between 150 mg and 300 mg
due to large baseline differences and randomization
of most DLB patients into the 150 mg group and PDD
patients into 300 mg group.
Study approvals
The protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review
Board
(IRB
#2014-0006)
at
George-
town University Medical Center as well as by
Georgetown-Howard Universities Center for Clini-
cal and Translational Science (GHUCCTS) scientific
review board. This study was performed in con-
sultation with the FDA. The study was listed on
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02281474). All participants
were recruited from the movement disorders clinic at
MedStar Georgetown University Hospital and were
consented at the GHUCCTS Clinical Research Unit
(CRU). Eligible participants were computer random-
ized to either 150 mg or 300 mg groups and enrolled
in the study. Patients were de-identified and a Pad-
Id was included (e.g. NIL) in the patient’s clinical
chart. An independent safety and monitoring board
(DSMB) that included a cardiologist, hematologist,
clinical pharmacologist, neurologist and biostatisti-
cian monitored safety signals in patients in the study.
RESULTS
Screening, enrollment and retention
Thirty participants were screened and twelve PDD
or DLB participants (Table 1) were randomized into
150 mg (n = 5) or 300 mg (n = 7) groups and received
oral daily doses of Nilotinib for 24 weeks with an
additional 12 weeks follow up (Fig. 1). Eighteen
patients failed screening due to cardiovascular dis-
ease, infarcts, QTc interval >450 ms or excluded
medications (i.e. Coumadin). One patient (NIL 9)
was withdrawn from the study due to serious adverse
events (SAEs) and another (NIL 8) discontinued at
5 months due to increased caregiver burden. Ten
patients completed the 24-week study and returned
for a follow up visit (week 36). One patient (NIL 12)
did not follow up at week 36.

Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
Adverse Events (AEs) that required or resulted in
hospitalization were classified as an SAE and were
listed in Supplementary Table 1. One participant in
the 300 mg Nilotinib group (NIL 9) was withdrawn at
week4anddiagnosedwithmyocardialinfarctandleft
bundle block. One participant in the 300 mg Nilotinib
group was hospitalized with urinary tract infection
(UTI) and one participant in the 150 mg group was
hospitalized with pneumonia and UTI (Supplemen-
tary Table 1).
Non-serious AEs
Non-serious AEs, which did not require hospital-
ization were classified per system and/or preferred
term and summarized in Supplementary Table 2 as
number of events and number of affected participants
in each group. One participant in the 150 mg group
and one in the 300 mg Nilotinib group had transient
QTc prolongation >450 ms but returned to a normal
QTc range in subsequent visits (detailed in Supple-
mentary Table 3). Participants in the 150 mg group
reported three UTIs, two cases of pneumonia, one
cold virus, one mild back pain, one mild headache,
one mild dysgraphia, one mild left foot drag, one mild
confusion, one mild hallucination, one mild paranoia,
one mild agitation, one moderate anxiety, one mild
incontinence, one moderate itching and one skin irri-
tation. Participants in the 300 mg group reported one
incident of blurry vision, one diarrhea, one nausea,
one mild fatigue, two generalized weakness, three
UTIs, one pneumonia, one weight loss, one tooth
extraction, one dizziness, two mild hallucinations,
one mild paranoia, one mild crying episode, one mild

QTc prolongation
One participant (NIL 9) in the 300 mg was
withdrawn due to moderate cardiac ischemia and
myocardial infarct and was double-stented for a left
bundle block (Supplementary Table 3) and this was
classified as an SAE in Table 2. NIL 8 had slight
QTc prolongation >450 ms at week 8, and NIL 15
had two episodes of QTc prolongation >450 ms at
week 2 and week 8 but QTc returned to normal range
in subsequent visits. NIL 8 withdrew from the study
at week 24 due to increased caregiver burden, but
returned for follow up (week 36) and NIL 12 did not
return for follow up at week 36.
Blood chemistry
Laboratory tests (Supplementary Table 4) were
performed throughout eleven visits according to pro-
tocol. Laboratory results of some participants were
outside the normal range at baseline (less than 100%
(<1 fold) difference from baseline) due to comor-
bidities that were not exclusionary. A total of three
AEs below normal range of alanine aminotrans-
ferase (ALT) level (<100%) were observed in the
150 mg Nilotinib group. Two AEs above normal
range (>100%), including one ALT and one biliru-
bin elevation were observed in the 150 mg Nilotinib
group. Two AEs with transient increase of ALT and
one AST above normal range (>100%) were observed
in the 300 mg Nilotinib group but returned to normal
by end of the study.
Nilotinib pharmacokinetics
Blood and CSF were collected from twelve partic-
ipants at baseline prior to treatment (n = 12, control)
and at 2 months treatment (n = 12). Blood and CSF
werecollectedfromninepatientsatsixmonths(n = 9)
of Nilotinib treatment (total n = 33 samples) and col-
lection time via lumbar puncture (LP) was staggered
at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 hrs after oral administration
of Nilotinib. Blood was collected 30 min prior to
LP. Two CSF samples were not tested because they
had >25 ng/ml hemoglobin. Pharmacokinetic anal-
ysis demonstrated that Nilotinib (Fig. 2A and E)
peaked in the plasma 2 hrs (Tmax) after dosing at 55
nM and 86 nM (Cmax) in the 150 mg and 300 mg
Nilotinib groups, respectively. Nilotinib (Fig. 2B and
E) also peaked in the CSF 2 hrs (Tmax) after dos-
ing at 5 nM and 11 nM (Cmax) in the 150 mg and
300 mg groups, respectively. Area under the curve
(AUC) was 157 and 232 ng/ml*h for plasma and
8 and 14 ng/ml*h for CSF in 150 mg and 300 mg
groups, respectively. Nilotinib was quantified in ref-
erence to 13C Nilotinib standard and samples were
precipitated and dialyzed to obtain unbound Nilo-
tinib. Nilotinib was not detected in the CSF (t1/2
∼1.8) 3 hrs after dosing suggesting short bioavail-
ability of unbound or free Nilotinib compared to
plasma t1/2 = 12.4 (Fig. 2E). The CSF:plasma ratio
of Nilotinib (Fig. 2C) is 12% and 5% with 300 mg
and 150 mg Nilotinib, respectively.
Target engagement
To demonstrate whether Nilotinib inhibits Abl via
de-phosphorylation, we measured pan-tyrosine CSF
Abl relative to total Abl via ELISA. Phosphorylated
Abl was reduced (30%) with 150 mg and 300 mg
Nilotinib (Fig. 2D), suggesting that Nilotinib may
inhibit CNS Abl phosphorylation. The absorbance
level of Abl phosphorylation in the CSF was maximal
(100%) at baseline prior to Nilotinib administra-
tion (Fig. 2F and G). However, pan-tyrosine Abl
absorbance levels were reduced in all patients in
the 150 mg group (Fig. 2F) and 300 mg groups
(Fig. 2G).
Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS)
Motor symptoms were monitored with UPDRS
at all clinic visits (Table 2). The UPDRS scores
were obtained at 1–4 hrs after oral dosing with Nilo-
tinib in each participant. An average decrease of
3.4 points and 3.6 points in UPDRS-III (motor) was
observed at six months (week 24) compared to base-
line with 150 mg and 300 mg Nilotinib, respectively.
These effects were reversed at the 36-week follow
up visit in all participants. An average decrease of
7 points and 11.1 points in UPRDS I-IV was also
observed at 6 months in the 150 mg and 300 mg
groups, respectively. The change in UPDRS was pro-
gressive throughout the 6 months (24-week) trial, and
was reversed in participants in the follow up visit at
36 weeks. Most participants experienced increased
psychotic symptoms (hallucination, paranoia, agi-
tation) and some dyskinesia whilst on Nilotinib
suggesting an increase in CNS DA levels, which
required lowering or discontinuation of monoamine

was
monitored
with
MMSE at all clinic visits (Table 3). An average
increase of 3.85 and 3.5 points in MMSE was
observed at six months (24-week) compared to base-
line with 150 mg and 300 mg Nilotinib, respectively.
The increase in MMSE scores was incremental dur-
ing the 24-week treatment, and returned to baseline at
the 36-week follow up visit. The Scales for Outcomes
in Parkinson’s Disease-Cognition (SCOPA-Cog) test
also show an average increase of 1.85 and 2 points
at six months compared to baseline with 150 mg and
300 mg Nilotinib, respectively.
PD-related biomarkers
Because of the small sample size (n < 10), nor-
mal distribution is uncertain, thus a non-parametric
Wilcoxon signed and Mann-Whitney tests were
performed to compare biomarker changes between
baseline and two and six months treatment with
150 mg and 300 mg Nilotinib. However, as non-
parametric tests may be underpowered, a two tailed
paired t-test was also used to examine differences
between groups at baseline and after Nilotinib
treatment. CSF homovanillic acid (HVA), a DA
metabolite, was significantly increased (Supplemen-
tary Table 5) in the 150 mg group at 2 months (t-test)
and remained elevated (non-significant) at 6 months
compared to baseline. CSF HVA also significantly
increased in the 300 mg group at 6 months compared

to baseline (Supplementary Table 5). Abl activation
as well as DJ-1 are up-regulated in response to oxida-
tive stress [25–27] but CSF DJ-1 trended towards a
decrease in the 150 mg group, and was significantly
reduced in the 300 mg group at six months compared
to baseline and at 2 months compared to 6 months
(Supplementary Table 5).
CSF �-synuclein (Supplementary Table 5) was
slightly reduced at 2 and 6 months compared to
baseline in the 150 mg Nilotinib group, but the
level of �-synuclein was significantly (t-test) lower
at 2 months compared to 6 months. However, �-
synuclein (Supplementary Table 5) was unaltered
in the 300 mg Nilotinib group between baseline, 2
and 6 months. Data from the Parkinson’s Progres-
sion Markers Initiative (PPMI) suggest that CSF
�-synuclein does not change over six months in de
novo or mid-stage PD. However, the slight decrease
in CSF �-synuclein in the 150 mg Nilotinib group
over six months in the current PDD and DLB cohort
suggests that a placebo group is needed to interpret
the data definitively. Plasma �-synuclein was slightly
reduced at 2 months compared to baseline in the
150 mg group (Supplementary Figure 1A) but at 6
months it became significantly higher compared to 2
months. Interestingly, plasma levels of �-synuclein in
 F. Pagan et al. / Nilotinib is Safe at Low Doses and it Enters the CSF in PD

some subjects were elevated 3 months after termina-
tion of treatment. Similarly, plasma �-synuclein was
significantly reduced at 2 months compared to base-
line in the 300 mg group (Supplementary Figure 1B)
but returned to baseline at 6 months. Plasma levels of
�-synuclein in some subjects were elevated 3 months
after termination of treatment. Taken together these
data suggest that Nilotinib may stabilize �-synuclein
levels in PD, but a larger sample with a placebo group
is needed to interpret these results.
Surrogate biomarkers
CSF S100B is a marker of glial death in the brain
[28, 29] and neuron specific enolase (NSE) is elevated
after stroke and brain trauma [30, 31], suggesting cell
death. The level of S100B was gradually reduced
in the 150 mg and 300 mg groups. However, NSE
level was significantly reduced at 6 months compared
to baseline in the CSF in both 150 mg and 300 mg
groups (Supplementary Table 5). CSF total tau and
p-tau are increased in PD and DLB compared to con-
trol [32–34]. Total tau and the ratio of total tau/p-tau
181 were significantly reduced at 2 months compared
to baseline in the 150 mg group, while total tau was
significantly reduced at 6 months compared to base-
line in the 300 mg group. No changes in CSF A�40 or
A�42 were detected in 150 mg group, but CSF A�40
was significantly reduced at 6 months compared to
baseline in the 300 mg Nilotinib group.
DISCUSSION
Collectively, these data suggest that once daily
oral administration of 150 mg or 300 mg Nilotinib
may be safe and tolerated in subjects with PDD or
DLB. A number of AEs were observed but they are
not unexpected in this patient population. The SAE
recorded in one patient (NIL 9) is due to subclini-
cal myocardial abnormalities that were not detected
by EKG at screening; the subject was subsequently
diagnosed with left bundle block and T wave changes
that required stenting, suggesting that caution must
be used with Nilotinib treatment. Eleven study par-
ticipants reported more frequent bowel movements,
supporting anecdotal evidence that Nilotinib may
affect constipation.
In this study we show that Nilotinib may enter the
CSF and that it may inhibit CNS Abl. These find-
ings are consistent with our preclinical studies, which
showed that Nilotinib enters the brain and inhibits
Abl, leading to protection of DA neurons [13, 21, 22].
Our data suggest that higher doses of Nilotinib may
result in higher concentrations of the drug in the CSF,
but the ratio of CSF:plasma is higher with 150 mg
compared to 300 mg Nilotinib, leading to similar lev-
els of CSF Abl inhibition. The observed differences
in CSF:plasma ratio of Nilotinib is perhaps due to
the role of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) trans-
porters, which facilitate Nilotinib efflux at the BBB
[35]. Additionally, Nilotinib peaks at 2 hrs after oral
dosing in the CSF and the level of p-Abl is reduced
by 30% at 1 hr and remains at this level for several
hours after Nilotinib washes out. Nilotinib in the CSF
is unbound, whereas Nilotinib protein binding capac-
ity in plasma is 98% and plasma protein binding is
irreversible. Therefore, it is possible that the differ-
ence between the CSF concentration of free Nilotinib
and CSF p-Abl over time is due to Nilotinib binding
in brain parenchyma, leading to Abl inhibition and
reduction of CSF p-Abl.
Abl activation induces misfolded protein pathol-
ogy and oxidative stress in PD animal models and
Abl inhibition with Nilotinib reduces oxidative stress
[13, 21, 22, 24]. These findings are consistent with
our results, which show a significant decrease of the
PD-related oxidative stress sensor DJ-1 [25, 26] dur-
ing Nilotinib treatment. Although the role of DJ-1 is
not well understood in PD, Abl as well as DJ-1 are
up-regulated in response to oxidative stress [25–27]
and the reduction in CSF level of DJ-1of Nilotinib
treatment suggests a decrease in oxidative stress.
Additionally, CSF S100B and NSE have not been
well studied in PD, but they are well established CSF
biomarkers of neuronal and glial death in several neu-
rological diseases marked by cell loss and oxidative
tissue damage, including stroke, trauma and inflam-
mation [28–31].
Candidate CSF biomarkers for PD include DA and
its metabolites. CSF HVA is the end product of DA
metabolism, which is reduced in PD [36, 37], reflect-
ing diminution of central DA stores. CSF HVA levels
were significantly increased at 2 months and this
increase was sustained at 6 months after Nilotinib
treatment compared to baseline. CSF HVA levels
increased despite discontinuation of the MAO-B
inhibitor, Azilect (Rasagiline), which was discontin-
ued as a result of increased psychosis in the first 2–4
weeks after Nilotinib administration. These data sug-
gest that caution must be used in late stage PD with
Nilotinib. Some participants who were on high daily
dose of levodopa, including Nil 8 (stage 5), Nil 11
(stage 3), Nil 3 (stage 3), and Nil 2 (stage 3) had
their levodopa reduced by 100 mg, 250 mg, 125 mg
 514
F. Pagan et al. / Nilotinib is Safe at Low Doses and it Enters the CSF in PD
and 450 mg, respectively. No other medications were
changed throughout the study period. These data
support a possible role for Nilotinib in increasing
DA levels, in agreement with preclinical findings that
Nilotinib protects DA neurons and increases both
DA and HVA in MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-
tetrahydropyridine) and �-synucleinopathy models
of PD [13, 19, 21]. The increase in DA may be due to
one or more of several potential mechanisms. Firstly,
preclinical evidence shows that autophagic clearance
of �-synuclein in SN neurons increases DA levels
possibly via greater DA synthesis [13]. Secondly,
Parkin activation inhibits MAO-B and attenuates DA
breakdown, leading to an increase in DA levels in
vitro [38]; and our previous studies indicate that Nilo-
tinib inhibits astrocytes, which modulate MAO-B
activity [16]. The current results are also consistent
with the effect of Nilotinib on increasing Parkin activ-
ity in-vivo and in-vitro [13, 19]. Finally, DA may
also be derived from non-nigral neurons in ventral
tegmental area (VTA) that are part of the mesolimbic
dopaminergic system.
In PD, the CSF concentrations of �-synuclein are
reduced compared to healthy controls [32, 39–41]
and the level of CSF �-synuclein is even lower
in patients with more advanced �-synucleinopathies
[40]. Several studies suggest that reduction of CSF
�-synuclein is associated with an accumulation of
misfolded �-synuclein in CNS Lewy bodies [42–44].
Therefore, a drug that may increase or stabilize CSF
�-synuclein levels is desirable as it may reflect atten-
uation of �-synuclein accumulation in the brain.
We previously demonstrated that Nilotinib penetrates
the BBB and promotes autophagic degradation of
�-synuclein in PD models [13, 14, 18, 19, 35]. In the
current study, the absence of a placebo group makes
the CSF �-synuclein data difficult to interpret. Simi-
larly, previous reports also suggest that CSF A�42 is
decreased, while CSF total tau and p-tau are increased
in PD and DLB compared to control [32–34]. CSF
A�40, A�42, total tau and p-tau are biomarkers of
AD and they were measured as exploratory outcomes
in this cohort. CSF tau and A�40 were reduced after
Nilotinib treatment in agreement with preclinical data
demonstrating autophagic clearance of these proteins
in animal models of neurodegeneration [13, 14, 18,
19, 35]. A� and tau pathologies are also frequently
foundintheCNSofPDpatientsandtheymaybeasso-
ciated with the development of cognitive impairment
in PDD and DLB [45–48].
Participants in the Nilotinib trial experienced
incremental improvement in motor and non-motor
UPDRS I-IV scores, which were decreased, and
motor symptoms declined after the end of treatment
back to baseline, suggesting a possible beneficial
clinical effect. L-Dopa replacement therapies are
effective
for
symptomatic
motor
management
and may worsen non-motor symptoms, including
psychosis. Although these clinical outcomes were
observed in the absence of a placebo group and blind-
ing procedures, the incremental improvement in both
motor and cognitive outcomes provides rationale
for a follow-on study. The decrease in UPDRS I-IV
suggests improvement at six months compared to
baseline. In both PDD and DLB patients, MMSE and
SCOPA-Cog progressively improved (3.85 points
and 2 points, respectively). However, we cannot
rule out placebo effects or learning effects in the
absence of a placebo group. The apparent motor and
cognitive outcomes may be attributable to increased
DA levels. Specifically, motor and cognitive skills
may be affected by the increase of DA that amelio-
rates motor impairment and may affect cognition via
mesolimbic signaling to pre-frontal cortex.
In conclusion, this is the first study to treat subjects
with advanced PD with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
The present results tentatively suggest that low doses
of Nilotinib are relatively safe in subjects with
advanced PD or DLB, supporting that further clin-
ical trials are performed. However, the study was
conducted only in a small cohort of patients over
24 weeks and, therefore, any conclusions based on
the present results should be made with great cau-
tion. Our data also suggest that nilotinib may enter
the CSF and that it appears to engage its target Abl.
We also obtained preliminary evidence of changes
in DA metabolism in the CSF following treatment
with nilotinib. However, the participants did not con-
stitute a homogenous cohort, and there were large
baseline differences in DA metabolite levels, making
a definitive interpretation of these results difficult.
Taken together, the data suggest that it is warranted
to move forward with clinical trials to determine
an appropriate therapeutic dose and evaluate Nilo-
tinib effects in larger, randomized, double-blinded,
placebo-controlled trials.
