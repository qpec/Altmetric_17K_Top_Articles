ABSTRACT
Background Electronic health records (EHRs) may reduce medical errors and 
improve care, but can complicate clinical encounters.
Objective To describe hospital-based physicians’ perceptions of the impact of 
EHRs on patient–physician interactions and contrast these findings against office-
based physicians’ perceptions.
Methods We performed a qualitative analysis of comments submitted in response 
to the 2014 Rhode Island Health Information Technology Survey to gain a more in-
depth understanding of individual physicians’ experiences using their EHRs. Office- 
and hospital-based physicians licensed in Rhode Island, in active practice, and 
located in Rhode Island or neighboring states completed the survey about their 
Electronic Health Record use. 
Results The survey’s response rate was 68.3% and 2,236 (87.1%) respondents 
had EHRs. Among survey respondents, 27.3% of hospital-based and 37.8% of 
office-based physicians with EHRs responded to the question about patient inter-
action. Five main themes emerged for hospital-based physicians, with respondents 
generally perceiving EHRs as negatively altering patient interactions. We noted 
the same five themes among office-based physicians, but the rank order of the 
top two responses differed by setting: hospital-based physicians commented most 
frequently that they spend less time with patients because they have to spend more 
time on computers; office-based physicians commented most frequently on EHRs 
worsening the quality of their interactions and relationships with patients.
Conclusion In our analysis of a large sample of physicians, hospital-based 
physicians generally perceived EHRs as negatively altering patient interactions, 
although they emphasized different reasons than their office-based counterparts. 
These findings add to the prior literature that focuses on outpatient physicians, and 
can shape interventions to improve how EHRs are used in inpatient settings.

InTRoduCTIon
Electronic health records (EHRs) were developed for billing 
and documentation, but have increasingly shifted administra-
tive tasks to physicians, fundamentally changing their work, 
workflow and interactions with patients. Although EHRs may 
reduce medical errors and improve care through compli-
ance with guidelines, improved care coordination and access 
to health information,1–3 their use can complicate clinical 
encounters and impact patient–physician interactions.4,5
Literature on how EHR use affects patient–physician 
interactions is mixed and focused on the outpatient setting. 
Some investigators describe improved communication and 
increased patient satisfaction5–7 as well as enhanced patient–
physician collaboration.8 However, many studies suggest 
that EHRs negatively impact patient–physician interactions; 
for example, physicians with EHRs spend more time on doc-
umentation, potentially leading to less time with patients.9,10 
Physicians may communicate less effectively when using 
EHRs, perhaps due to time spent looking at the computer, 
more keyboarding and less time for conversation and peri-
ods of silence during the consultation while physicians enter 
data.11–15 EHRs’ interference with face-to-face interactions 
substantially worsens professional satisfaction16, 17 and has 
been the topic of many editorials by physicians.18–22
Because research on EHRs’ impact on inpatient inter-
actions is limited, we undertook a qualitative analysis of a 
statewide physician survey across specialties to assess hos-
pital-based physicians’ perceptions about how using an EHR 
affects interactions with patients. Our findings may inform 
development of interventions to improve the use of EHRs 
during inpatient clinical encounters.
METHodS
data source
Under a data use agreement with the Rhode Island Department 
of Health (RIDOH), we obtained a merged data set containing 
data from the 2014 Rhode Island Health Information Technology 
(HIT) Survey23 and physician licensure applications. The data 
set does not contain identifiable information; therefore, the 
Brown University Institutional Review Board determined that this 
analysis did not constitute human subjects research. 
Survey instrument and administration
RIDOH and its public reporting contractor, Healthcentric 
Advisors, regularly administer the Rhode Island HIT Survey 
to measure the presence and use of HIT by physicians caring 
for Rhode Island patients. RIDOH then publishes structural 
measures at the individual level and shares aggregate data 
with state agencies and other stakeholders.
The survey asks respondents to provide information about 
their practice setting and specialty, indicate how often they 
use EHR and e-prescribing functionalities, and answer sev-
eral free-text questions. This includes the open-ended ques-
tion we examined in this analysis: ‘How does using an EHR 
affect your interaction with patients?’ We included this open-
ended question to gain a deeper understanding of physicians’ 
experiences balancing their EHR use with patient interac-
tions; such experiences are not easily captured with multiple 
choice responses.
In mid-2014, RIDOH and Healthcentric Advisors adminis-
tered the survey to 3,761 physicians licensed in Rhode Island, 
in active practice, and located in Rhode Island, Connecticut 
or Massachusetts. These physicians received mailed notices 
and, if email addresses were included with licensure informa-
tion, email notifications and up to two reminders.
data analysis
Each author has expertise relevant for this analysis: all three 
completed graduate-level training in qualitative analysis 
methods; one is funded for mixed-methods research and one 
has clinical expertise in both inpatient and outpatient settings. 
We performed a directed24 qualitative analysis using a com-
bination of deductive and inductive coding. We selected a quali-
tative approach because of the subjective nature of physicians’ 
experiences when interacting with patients. These methods 
allowed us to gain a more in-depth understanding of individual 
experiences while also deriving overall themes to inform inter-
ventions to improve physician satisfaction and patient experience 
with EHRs and to identify future research questions. First, one of 
the authors created an a priori codebook based on existing EHR 
literature. Second, each author independently examined and 
coded data using the codebook and any new codes identified. 
We excluded responses such as ‘no comment’. Third, we met 
to review coding discrepancies and agree on major themes. We 
considered the frequency of words and codes, intensity of lan-
guage and specificity of comments. Fourth, we individually per-
formed second-level coding, during which we categorized codes 
into the agreed-upon themes and rank-ordered themes for each 
setting based on each theme’s prevalence. We selected quotes 
from each theme to present in the results; no single respondent 
was quoted more than once in order to represent the widest pos-
sible range of respondents’ views. Finally, we compared demo-
graphic information for physicians who did and did not answer 
the patient interaction question to assist readers with assessing 
the transferability of our findings and for us to explore why we 
found what we did, examine response bias and refine further 
research questions stemming from our findings.
RESuLTS
The 2014 Rhode Island HIT Survey’s overall response rate 
was 68.3%, with 2,567 of 3,761 physicians completing the 
survey. Among the survey respondents, 2,236 (87.1%) had 
EHRs; and among those hospital-based physicians with 
EHRs (969), 265 (27.3%) responded to the open-ended 
question asking how EHRs affected their patient interactions. 
Compared to hospital-based physicians who did not answer 
the question, hospital-based physicians who did were more 
likely to be older and to practice primary care or emergency 
medicine (Table 1). About 40% (479) of office-based phy-
sicians with EHRs (1,267) responded to the open-ended

question. Compared to office-based physicians who did not 
answer the question, office-based physicians who did were 
also older and more likely to practice primary care.
Four main themes emerged (Table 2). Hospital-based 
physicians consistently conveyed that EHRs have a nega-
tive impact on their interaction with patients: the majority of 
responses and derived themes were negative or neutral. 
Positive responses focused on information access and use in 
patient care. We noted the same four themes among office-
based physicians, but the rank order of the top two responses 
differed by setting: hospital-based physicians commented 
most frequently that they spend less time with patients 
because they have to spend more time on computers, office-
based physicians commented most frequently on EHRs 
worsening the quality of their interactions and relationships 
with patients. Comments that were generally positive and 
comments that detailed the patient’s perspective comprised 
the least commonly observed themes for both settings.
Major themes
EHRs mean less time to spend with patients 
because more time is required for documentation
The most common theme among hospital-based physicians, 
and the second most common theme overall, focused on the 
additional time spent using a computer for documentation 
that then takes away from time spent directly interacting with 
patients.

Table 2 Major themes in free text responses from physicians
‘We spend less time at bedside and more time interact-
ing with our computers’. [Hospital-based Respondent]
‘I now spend much less time [with] patients because I 
know I have hours of data entry to complete’. [Hospital-
based Respondent]
Physicians distinguished between time spent on documenta-
tion that resulted in less time in the exam room or at the bed-
side, versus the time spent looking at a computer during the 
clinical interaction itself. Hospital-based physicians more com-
monly described less time in the exam room or at the bedside, 
compared to office-based physicians who commented more 
about time spent looking at a computer and not the patient.
EHRs reduce the quality of the patient–physician 
interaction and relationship
The second most common theme among hospital-based 
physicians was the negative impact of EHRs on the quality of 
interactions with patients and therefore physicians’ relation-
ships with patients. 
‘Negatively [affects interactions]. Interacting with com-
puter rather than my patient. Like having someone at the 
dinner table texting rather than paying attention’. [Office-
based Respondent]
Decreased eye contact while documenting during the clinical 
encounter emerged as a prominent sub-theme.
‘My nose is now burrowed deep into my computer inter-
face, leaving markedly reduced time to make eye con-
tact and actually interact one on one with my patient’. 
[Hospital-based Respondent]
We identified as a second sub-theme the perception that 
using an EHR depersonalizes the interaction and distracts 
both patient and physician. Comments included words such 
as intrusive, impersonal, limits, interferes, distracts and 
disruptive to describe how using an EHR affects patient 
interaction, and physicians often referred to the EHR as a 
barrier.
‘I don’t feel connected as I am always looking at the 
[screen]/typing. The art of medicine and treating is lost in 
 
this process’. [Hospital-based Respondent]
‘Detracts from face to face contact with patients. I [a]m 
looking at a screen to make sure that I’ve checked off all 
the necessary data points irregardless of whether they 
have any relationship to the reason the patient is being 
seen’. [Office-based Respondent]

Pelland et al. ‘It is like texting at the dinner table’: a qualitative analysis of the impact of electronic health records 220
‘I love [showing] Google images to the patients in the 
office for the purpose of patient education. I save mean-
ingful graphic representatives with which to teach. I use 
numerous we[b]-based tools . . . [However], for some 
visits it reduces eye contact’. [Office-based Respondent]
A third sub-theme captured how EHRs improved communica-
tion with other physicians, most commonly through access to 
notes, and how this access facilitated their interaction with 
patients.
‘Allows me in the ED to look at an old record before I 
see the patient to learn some history’. [Hospital-based 
Respondent]
This theme was also the fourth most commonly described 
among office-based physicians, although differences were 
noted among the sub-themes. Office-based physicians com-
mented more frequently about using EHRs during the visit to 
facilitate communication and noted improved communication 
with patients via patient portals, while they less frequently 
commented that viewing problem lists and lab results help 
them feel more prepared for the clinical encounter.
Negative or positive, but non-specific comments 
about patient interactions
In the remaining quotes (separate from the four main themes), 
some physicians expressed that using EHRs had an undesir-
able impact on their interactions, without providing additional 
detail. Similarly, physicians expressed positive but non-spe-
cific statements; this was the least commonly identified. No 
major differences were found between settings.
dISCuSSIon
Our analysis of a large sample of hospital-based physicians 
across most specialties demonstrates that they generally 
perceive EHRs as negatively altering patient interactions, but 
emphasize different reasons than their office-based counter-
parts. Hospital-based physicians commented most frequently 
that they spend less time with patients because they have to 
spend more time on computers; office-based physicians, on 
EHRs worsening the quality of their patient interactions and 
relationships. 
These findings add to the literature by focusing on hospital-
based physicians and contrasting their perceptions with office-
based physicians in the same statewide sample. The difference 
in frequency of the top two themes likely reflects fundamental 
differences in how inpatient and outpatient physicians work, 
with hospital-based physicians frequently using computers 
situated outside of patient rooms and office-based physicians 
increasingly bringing laptops into exam rooms. Both groups 
described strategies to adapt to an increasing documentation 
burden, with some hospital-based physicians describing the 
use of problem lists and lab results to feel more prepared for 
the clinical encounter, and office-based physicians choosing to 
work additional hours at the office or at home. 
Prior studies have focused more narrowly on specific spe-
cialties or the outpatient setting.15 For example, small studies 
EHRs have no effect on patient interaction
A smaller proportion of physicians in the hospital setting com-
mented that EHRs have no effect on their interaction with 
patients. This was the third most commonly observed theme 
among hospital-based physicians, and two distinct sub-
themes emerged. The first sub-theme, more common among 
hospital-based physicians, was that EHRs truly did not affect 
their interaction because it was not a major part of their work-
flow or because they had learned to incorporate EHRs with-
out difficulty.
‘Minimal [effect], as most of my patients are newborn 
infants. EHR is of some help in communication with par-
ents’. [Hospital-based Respondent]
‘Doesn’t [affect interactions] . . . Medical ass[istan]t in the 
room acts as a scribe during p[atien]t encounter’. [Office-
based Respondent]
While this theme was also the third most common among 
office-based physicians, a notable difference is that office-
based physicians more commonly described that EHRs 
do not affect patient interactions because physicians have 
altered their workflow to prevent the EHR from having a neg-
ative impact, which emerged as the second sub-theme. 
‘I have to do my documentation after seeing the 
patients because I am not going to type into the 
computer while they are trying to talk to me’. 
 
[Office-based Respondent]
Many of these office-based physicians who described alter-
ing their workflow also noted that this approach resulted in 
longer work days to complete the required documentation:
‘I have tried to keep the [patient]-doctor interaction at the 
forefront of this work, so I mostly jot notes on paper in the 
room . . . this means I have hours and hours of work at 
home, but I can’t and won’t stop putting the patient at the 
center’. [Office-based Respondent]
EHRs improve access to information, which 
benefits patient interactions
Hospital-based physicians described how easy access to 
information has a positive impact on their interactions with 
patients. This was the fourth most commonly identified 
theme, and we identified several sub-themes. First, hospital-
based physicians commented that viewing problem lists and 
lab results help them prepare for the clinical encounter and 
make it more efficient. 
‘Helps me with the past medical history before I see the 
patient which is beneficial in the ED’. [Hospital-based 
Respondent]
A second sub-theme encompassed how physicians used 
EHRs to facilitate communication, by allowing the patient 
and physician to review test results together and by providing 
ready access to educational materials.
 Journal of Innovation in Health Informatics Vol 24, No 2 (2017)
Pelland et al. ‘It is like texting at the dinner table’: a qualitative analysis of the impact of electronic health records 221
have illustrated that EHRs draw office-based physicians’ atten-
tion away from patients and encroach on opportunities to con-
nect with patients.9,12,25–27 One investigator found that the 
addition of computers in the exam room impacted communi-
cation by altering the verbal, visual and postural connections 
between the patient and the clinician.25 Computers can add 
complexity through the introduction of new physical tasks (e.g. 
typing) during the clinical encounter, but may also simplify the 
office visit by providing easier access to clinical data. Similar 
studies emphasize that office-based physicians are often 
unaware of the amount of time spent looking at screens and 
how little they are simultaneously engaged with patients.12,26
Inpatient studies are more limited, but they also reveal 
both positive and negative impacts.28,29 One demonstrates 
that EHRs can reduce emergency medicine physicians’ time 
and interaction with patients.29 Another finds that allowing 
patients to interact with EHRs can enhance patient satisfac-
tion and the patient–physician relationship. Future research 
could examine physician-level characteristics other than their 
physical location to identify any association with particular 
views or behaviours.
Some investigators have developed approaches to mitigate 
EHRs’ disruption of patient interactions, primarily in the outpa-
tient setting. Recommendations include positioning computer 
monitors so physicians’ backs are not to patients, particularly 
when discussing sensitive topics30,31 and so patients can easily 
see the screen,26,30–32 briefly familiarizing themselves with charts 
prior to entering the exam room,26,32 and ‘Honoring the Golden 
Minute’ by engaging with the patient before using the EHR.32 
Recommendations also include physicians telling patients what 
they are doing on the computer as they do it, to engage patients 
and minimize awkward silences, and pointing to the screen to 
highlight results.30,31 Others noted the importance of learning 
how to touch-type, to maintain eye contact.26 It is unclear how 
these recommendations would transfer to the inpatient environ-
ment, especially given the differences described in our findings.
In our study, physicians widely acknowledged EHRs as a 
permanent presence, saying they must adapt their work and 
workflow. EHR adoption has accelerated over the past 15 
years, with estimates that physicians’ use of any EHR system 
increased from 18.2% to 71.8% between 2001 and 2012.33 
The increase parallels burgeoning reporting requirements for 
physicians and hospitals seeking value-based payments,34 
which have necessitated profound changes in the way physi-
cians write their notes.16,35 Many physicians in our study said 
these documentation requirements compounded the already-
challenging process of integrating EHRs into clinical practice 
and contributed to longer work hours. Addressing these find-
ings will require more than simply incorporating strategies to 
use an EHR in a more patient-centred way. Future in-person 
research through focus groups or key informant interviews 
could investigate the derived themes in more detail and fur-
ther explore feasible opportunities to address our findings.
Limitations
We note several limitations. First, physicians with EHRs and 
with greater comfort with technology may be more likely to 
respond to the Rhode Island HIT Survey, because of greater 
interest in the topic and because they are more likely to 
have the technical capacity to complete an electronic survey. 
Second, our analysis is limited to the approximately one-
third of hospital- and office-based physicians who provided 
free-text responses to the single patient interaction question. 
Respondents may be more likely to answer this question if 
they feel strongly (negatively or positively) about the impact 
of EHRs on their interaction with patients. Among those who 
did respond, we could not complete further in-depth analysis 
because we were using secondary, written responses and 
unable to follow-up to probe for additional information. Third, 
we classified physicians as hospital- or office-based using sur-
vey responses; physicians may be subject to misclassification, 
as they can complete the survey for a different practice site if 
their main practice does not have an EHR. Finally, the survey 
was administered in a single state, which may limit its gener-
alizability; however, the large sample size, high response rate, 
range of represented specialties and array of EHR vendors 
may mitigate this limitation.
ConCLuSIon
EHRs were first developed for billing and documentation, but 
have increasingly shifted administrative tasks to physicians, 
fundamentally changing their work, workflow and, ultimately, 
how they interact with patients. Our qualitative analysis details 
hospital-based physicians’ perceptions of the impact of EHRs 
on patient–physician interactions and contrasts these percep-
tions against those of their office-based counterparts, add-
ing to the existing body of evidence focusing on outpatient 
physician–patient interaction. Although hospital-based physi-
cians report benefits ranging from better information access to 
improved patient education and communication, unintended 
negative consequences are more frequent themes. When 
comparing themes across settings, we note that hospital-
based physicians more frequently comment on the use of 
EHRs to feel more prepared for the clinical encounter, while 
office-based physicians more frequently comment on altera-
tion of workflow and the depersonalization of relationships. 
Our findings can be used to shape interventions to improve 
how EHRs are used in inpatient settings and to tailor those 
interventions to specific specialties, with the end-goal of 
improving both physician satisfaction and patient experience.
