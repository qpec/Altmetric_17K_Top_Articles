Abstract: BACKGROUND Combined BRAF-MEK inhibitor therapy is the standard of care for BRAF-
mutant advanced melanoma. We investigated encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor with unique target-binding
properties, alone or in combination with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib, versus vemurafenib in patients
with advanced BRAF-mutant melanoma. METHODS COLUMBUS was conducted as a two-part, ran-
domised, open-label phase 3 study at 162 hospitals in 28 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years
or older and had histologically confirmed locally advanced (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC]
stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV), unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma, or unknown primary melanoma;
a BRAF or BRAF mutation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0
or 1; and were treatment naive or had progressed on or after previous first-line immunotherapy. In part 1
of the study, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via interactive response technology to receive either
oral encorafenib 450 mg once daily plus oral binimetinib 45 mg twice daily (encorafenib plus binimetinib
group), oral encorafenib 300 mg once daily (encorafenib group), or oral vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily
(vemurafenib group). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by blinded independent central
review for encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib. Efficacy analyses were by intention-to-treat.
Safety was analysed in patients who received at least one dose of study drug and one postbaseline safety
assessment. The results of part 2 will be published separately. This study is registered with Clinical-
Trials.gov, number NCT01909453, and EudraCT, number 2013-001176-38. FINDINGS Between Dec 30,
2013, and April 10, 2015, 577 of 1345 screened patients were randomly assigned to either the encorafenib
plus binimetinib group (n=192), the encorafenib group (n=194), or the vemurafenib group (n=191).
With a median follow-up of 16·6 months (95% CI 14·8-16·9), median progression-free survival was
14·9 months (95% CI 11·0-18·5) in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group and 7·3 months (5·6-8·2)
in the vemurafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·54, 95% CI 0·41-0·71; two-sided p<0·0001). The most
common grade 3-4 adverse events seen in more than 5% of patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib
group were increased ￿-glutamyltransferase (18 [9%] of 192 patients), increased creatine phosphokinase
(13 [7%]), and hypertension (11 [6%]); in the encorafenib group they were palmoplantar erythrodysaes-
thesia syndrome (26 [14%] of 192 patients), myalgia (19 [10%]), and arthralgia (18 [9%]); and in the
vemurafenib group it was arthralgia (11 [6%] of 186 patients). There were no treatment-related deaths
except for one death in the combination group, which was considered possibly related to treatment by the
investigator. INTERPRETATION Encorafenib plus binimetinib and encorafenib monotherapy showed
favourable efficacy compared with vemurafenib. Overall, encorafenib plus binimetinib appears to have
an improved tolerability profile compared with encorafenib or vemurafenib. Encorafenib plus binimetinib
could represent a new treatment option for patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. FUNDING Array

Summary  
Background: BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy is standard-of-care in BRAFV600-
mutant advanced melanoma. We investigated encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor with unique 
pharmacology, alone or in combination with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib, vs vemurafenib in 
advanced BRAFV600-mutant melanoma. 
Methods: COLUMBUS (COmbined LGX818 Used with MEK162 in BRAF-mutant 
Unresectable Skin cancer) is a 2-part randomised phase 3 study conducted at 162 centres in 28 
countries. In Part 1, patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer unresectable stage 
IIIB/C or IV BRAFV600-mutant melanoma were randomised via interactive response technology 
(1:1:1) to oral encorafenib 450 mg once daily plus binimetinib 45 mg twice daily (COMBO450), 
encorafenib 300 mg once daily (ENCO300), or vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily (VEM). 
Progression-free survival for COMBO450 vs VEM (primary endpoint) was analysed in the 
intention-to-treat population by blinded independent central review. Safety was analysed in 
patients who received at least one dose of study drug and one postbaseline safety assessment. 
Results of Part 2 will be published separately(NCT01909453/EudraCT 2013-001176-38). 
Findings: Between December 30, 2013, and April 10, 2015, 577 patients were randomised 
(COMBO450, n=192; ENCO300, n=194; VEM, n=191) in Part 1. With a median follow-up of 
16·6 (95% CI 14·8–16·9) months, risk of progression or death with COMBO450 compared with 
VEM was reduced by 46% (HR 0·54 [95% CI 0·41–0·71], 2-sided p<0·001). Median 
progression-free survival was 14·9 months (95% CI 11·0–18·5) with COMBO450, 9·6 months 
(95% CI 7·5–14·8) with ENCO300, and 7·3 months (95% CI 5·6–8·2) with VEM. The most 
common grade 3/4 adverse events seen in more than 5% of patients were increased gamma-
glutamyl transferase (18 [9%]), increased creatine phosphokinase (13 [7%]), and hypertension 
  
4 
(11 [6%]) with COMBO450; palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (26 [14%]) and 
myalgia (19 [10%]) with ENCO300; and arthralgia (11 [6%]) with VEM. 
Interpretation: COMBO450 and ENCO300 demonstrated favourable efficacy compared with 
VEM. Overall, COMBO450 displayed better tolerability than either comparator arm.

Introduction 
Genetic alterations resulting in an activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway 
occur in almost all melanomas. The most frequent is the BRAFV600 mutation, occurring in 35–
50% of patients.1 Activating BRAF mutations drive constitutive MAPK pathway activation, with 
subsequent proliferation and enhanced cellular survival, making it a promising therapeutic 
target.1 In vitro investigations demonstrated that growth of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells can 
be inhibited by BRAF or MEK inhibitors.2  
 
A crystallography-guided drug design approach produced multiple ATP-competitive BRAF 
kinase inhibitors entering clinical trials, with vemurafenib the first to demonstrate efficacy in 
BRAF-mutant melanoma,3,4 followed by dabrafenib.5 MAPK pathway reactivation is implicated 
in BRAF inhibitor monotherapy resistance.6 In addition, toxicities associated with BRAF 
inhibition, notably secondary squamous cell skin cancer and other skin toxicities, are caused by 
BRAF inhibitors paradoxically activating the wild-type BRAF kinase, promoting dimerization 
that triggers RAS-independent transactivation and activation of the MAPK pathway in normal 
tissues.7 Subsequent clinical trials in patients with BRAFV600-mutant melanoma demonstrated 
that dual MAPK pathway targeting with a BRAF inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor improves 
efficacy and ameliorates paradoxical MAPK activation–related toxicities associated with BRAF 
inhibitor monotherapy.8-11 Two BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations (dabrafenib/trametinib and 
vemurafenib/cobimetinib) are considered options for the treatment of metastatic or unresectable 
BRAFV600-mutant melanoma in current treatment guidelines.12,13 These BRAF/MEK inhibitor 
combinations are highly effective. However, both are associated with disease progression at a 
median of approximately 12 months, and each combination presents distinct tolerability 
  
6 
challenges to patients, highlighting the need for more effective and better tolerated therapies.8-
10,14-17 
 
Encorafenib is an ATP-competitive BRAF inhibitor that suppresses the MAPK pathway in 
tumour cells expressing several mutated forms of BRAF kinase (V600E, D, and K), with more 
than a 10-fold longer dissociation half-life (>30 hours) than either dabrafenib or vemurafenib, 
which enables sustained target inhibition.18 Preclinical studies suggest that this property may 
enhance antitumour activity while reducing paradoxical activation of MAPK in normal 
tissues.18,19 Binimetinib is an orally available, non-ATP competitive, allosteric inhibitor of 
MEK1 and MEK2.20  
 
Promising clinical activity and tolerability of the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib 
were observed in patients with BRAFV600-mutated melanoma in a phase 1b/2 and a phase 2 
study.21,22 Further, the maximum tolerated dose of encorafenib, when combined with 
binimetinib, was higher than the maximum tolerated dose of encorafenib monotherapy, thus 
allowing the use of a higher encorafenib dose when combined with binimetinib in subsequent 
trials.22 Here, we describe the results of the Part 1 of COLUMBUS trial, a phase 3 study of 
encorafenib plus binimetinib vs vemurafenib or encorafenib monotherapy in patients with 
advanced BRAFV600-mutant melanoma.  
 
Methods 
Study design and patients 
COLUMBUS is a 2-part, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study of the efficacy and 
safety of encorafenib and binimetinib combination therapy vs vemurafenib or encorafenib 
  
7 
monotherapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic BRAFV600-mutant 
melanoma. In Part 1, patients were randomised at 162 centres in 28 countries, including 20 sites 
in North America, 124 sites in Europe, and 18 sites in other selected countries (see 
Supplementary Materials). After completion of Part 1 enrolment, patients were recruited into 
Part 2 of the study, and the combination of encorafenib at its monotherapy maximum dose plus 
binimetinib was compared with encorafenib monotherapy at the same dose. It was conducted to 
better characterize the contribution of binimetinib to the combination. Results of Part 2 will be 
published separately. 
 
Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older; had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of 
locally advanced, unresectable/metastatic cutaneous melanoma or unknown primary melanoma 
with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV; had presence of 
BRAF V600E and/or V600K mutation in tumour tissue; and were treatment-naive or had 
progressed on or after previous first-line immunotherapy (see Supplementary Material for 
detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria).   
 
Independent ethics committees or review boards at each study site approved the study protocol 
and all amendments. Conduct of the study conformed with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and 
the ethical requirements outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was 
obtained from all patients before screening procedures were initiated. 
 
Randomisation and masking 
Patients were randomised (1:1:1) using validated interactive response technology (Parexel 
International, Billerica, MA, USA) to encorafenib 450 mg orally once daily plus binimetinib 45 
  
8 
mg orally twice daily (COMBO450), encorafenib 300 mg orally once daily (ENCO300), or 
vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily (VEM). Randomisation was stratified by AJCC stage 
(IIIB, IIIC, IVM1a, IVM1b, or IVM1c), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status (PS; 0 or 1), and BRAF mutation status (V600E vs V600K). After protocol 
amendment 2 (December 20, 2013), prior first-line immunotherapy (yes vs no) replaced BRAF 
mutation status as a stratification factor. Investigators and patients were not masked to treatment 
assignment. 
 
Procedures 
Central genetic mutation analysis to determine the presence of BRAF mutations was conducted 
before enrolment using the bioMérieux THxID® BRAF diagnostic test (bioMérieux, Marcy 
l’Etoile, France), which identifies both BRAF V600E and V600K gene mutations. Patients 
received COMBO450, ENCO300, or VEM according to randomised treatment assignment and 
continued until progression of disease per central review, death, unacceptable toxicity or 
withdrawal of consent. Dose modifications, including treatment interruptions and dose 
reductions, were permitted for each of the agents based on tolerability and adverse events. 
Details regarding drug manufacture and permitted dose modifications are provided in the 
Supplementary Materials.  
 
Baseline imaging was conducted within 21 days of randomisation and included chest, abdomen, 
and pelvis magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) and brain MRI or 
CT scan to assess central nervous system (CNS) disease. In the case of suspected bone 
metastases, a whole-body bone scan was performed; localized CT, MRI, or radiograph was 
performed for all skeletal lesions identified via the bone scan if not visible on the chest, 
  
9 
abdomen, and pelvis CT/MRI. If clinically indicated, a CT/MRI scan of other areas of disease, as 
appropriate, was performed. Color photography for all skin lesions, including a metric ruler to 
estimate the size, was performed. Tumour evaluations were performed every 8 weeks during the 
first 24 months and every 12 weeks thereafter using the same imaging modality as used at 
baseline. Additional tumour assessments were conducted if progression was clinically suspected. 
Tumour response was assessed centrally by blinded independent committee review (BICR) and 
by local review according to guidelines based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) version 1·1.23  
 
Safety assessments included collection of all adverse events; physical examinations included 
specific ophthalmic and dermatologic examination, cardiac assessments (electrocardiograms and 
multigated acquisition scans/echocardiograms), and clinical laboratory assessments. All patients 
in the COMBO450 arm had routine ophthalmic testing at each regularly scheduled visit during 
the treatment period.  For patients in the ENCO300 and VEM arms, ophthalmic testing at each 
regularly scheduled visit was only required if retinal abnormalities were present at baseline.  
Details on the ophthalmological examinations are included in the Supplementary Materials. 
Adverse event severity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events version 4·03. Adverse events were monitored during the study and for at least 30 
days after the last dose of study drug. 
 
Outcomes 
The primary endpoint was comparison of progression-free survival in the COMBO450 vs VEM 
groups as assessed by BICR. Secondary endpoints included comparison of progression-free 
survival in the COMBO450 vs ENCO300 groups; progression-free survival of patients in the 
  
10 
ENCO300 vs VEM groups; and best overall response, disease control rate, duration of response, 
and time to response. Detailed endpoint definitions are found in the Supplementary Materials. 
Data from tumour assessments read by BICR were used for the primary and secondary endpoints 
and analysis of best overall response, duration of response, and disease control; data from local 
assessments were used in supportive analyses. Analyses of other secondary outcomes, including 
overall survival (for which the number of events needed to trigger analyses has not yet been 
reached), quality of life, comparison of ECOG PS, and pharmacokinetic analysis, will be 
reported in a separate manuscript. 
 
Statistical analysis  
Sample size calculations were based on assumptions for progression-free survival medians 
derived from results of a phase 1b/2 study (NCT01543698) for COMBO450, a phase 1 study for 
ENCO300, and updated results from BRIM-3 and BRIM-2/COMBI-v, and coBRIM for 
VEM.9,14,18,22,24-26 
 
Analyses of the primary and key (type 1 error controlled) secondary endpoints for Part 1 were 
event-driven and were performed when enrolment in Part 1 was complete and the prespecified 
number of progression-free survival events for both the final primary and Part 1 key secondary 
comparison were available. A hierarchical testing procedure was adopted to control type 1 error 
for the primary and key secondary endpoints. The Part 1 key secondary endpoint, progression-
free survival of COMBO450 vs ENCO300, was to be tested if the primary efficacy endpoint, 
progression-free survival of COMBO450 vs VEM, was statistically significant. The driver of 
sample size was the key secondary endpoint of progression-free survival with COMBO450 vs 
ENCO300; for this comparison, 191 progression-free survival events were required to detect a 
  
11 
hazard ratio (HR) of 0·667 with 80% power using a log-rank test at a 1-sided 2·5% level of 
significance. For the primary comparisons of COMBO450 vs VEM, 145 progression-free 
survival events were required to detect an HR of 0·58 with 90% power using a log-rank test at a 
1-sided 2·5% level of significance. Assuming that 15% of patients would be lost to follow-up, it 
was estimated that 576 patients (192 in each group) would need to be recruited.  
 
Efficacy endpoints were analysed in the intention-to-treat population, which comprised all 
randomised patients. Patients were analysed by treatment group and strata as assigned during 
randomisation. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and 
had at least 1 postbaseline safety evaluation; patients were analysed according to treatment 
actually received. All available data were used to the greatest extent possible without imputations 
for missing data.  Details are included in Supplementary Materials. 
 
Median duration of follow-up for progression-free survival was estimated in two ways: 1) by 
summarising the observed follow-up for each patient (ie, the duration from date of randomisation 
to date of progression-free survival event or censoring), and 2) by conducting reverse Kaplan-
Meier analysis; the latter values are reported and reflect the potential follow-up in the absence of 
progressive disease or death. Progression-free survival was analysed according to the treatment 
group and 2 of the stratification factors (AJCC stage and ECOG PS) in which patients were 
randomised. Owing to the relatively low expected prevalence of patients with prior 
immunotherapy (~15%), it was prespecified that the 2 prior immunotherapy strata (yes vs no) 
were to be combined to avoid small or empty strata. Comparison of the distribution of 
progression-free survival used a stratified log-rank test; for the purposes of this summary, 2-
sided p-values are reported. The distribution of progression-free survival was described using 
  
12 
Kaplan-Meier methodology. Stratified Cox regression models were used to estimate the HRs for 
progression-free survival, along with 95% CIs based on the Wald test. The same methods were 
used for the key secondary comparison and for the supportive analyses based on local tumour 
assessments. Overall response and disease control were presented by treatment group with exact 
95% CIs; duration of response was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier methodology. For selected 
safety parameters, the time to first event was summarized using Kaplan-Meier methodology. 
Median time to onset and 95% CIs were summarised. Other median values were described using 
95% CIs or interquartile ranges (IQRs). 
 
The data cutoff date for analyses presented here was May 19, 2016. SAS version 9·2 (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC, USA) or higher was used for all analyses. This study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01909453, and with EudraCT, number 2013-001176-38. 
 
Role of the funding source 
The study was sponsored and designed with input from the steering committee (PAA, RD, CR, 
and KTF) by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation until September 2015, when sponsorship 
was transferred to Array BioPharma Inc. The steering committee contributed to the creation of 
adverse event management guidelines and supervised patient recruitment. Data were collected by 
Novartis and Array BioPharma during their respective sponsorships. Data analysis was 
conducted by Array BioPharma’s statistical team and interpreted by Array, in collaboration with 
the study authors. RD, PAA, CR, and KTF wrote the first draft of the manuscript with editorial 
support funded by the study sponsors, had full access to all study data, and held final 
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

Results 
Between December 30, 2013, and April 10, 2015, 577 patients were enrolled and were 
randomised to receive COMBO450 (n=192), ENCO300 (n=194), or VEM (n=191). Among 1345 
patients screened, 768 did not meet inclusion criteria; the most common reason for ineligibility 
was lack of the required BRAFV600E/V600K mutation in 364 of excluded patients (Figure 1). 
As of the data cutoff date of May 19, 2016, treatment was ongoing in 68, 46, and 27 patients in 
the COMBO450, ENCO300, and VEM groups, respectively. Demographic and clinical 
characteristics, including key prognostic factors at baseline, were similar across treatment groups 
(Table 1). Lactate dehydrogenase was above the upper limit of normal in 55 (29%), 47 (24%), 
and 52 patients (27%) randomised to COMBO450, ENCO300, and VEM, respectively. Patients 
had extensive disease, with 368 (64%) overall having stage IV M1c disease and 260 (45%) 
having 3 or more organs involved. A total of 172 patients (30%) overall had received prior 
immunotherapy; 26 patients (5%) had received prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy. 
 
At the time of the data cutoff, 98, 96, and 106 events contributed to the analysis of progression-
free survival in the COMBO450, ENCO300, and VEM groups, respectively. Median duration of 
follow-up was 16·7 months (95% CI 16·3–18·4) for the COMBO450 group, 14·4 months (95% 
CI 10·1–16·6) for the VEM group, and 16·6 months (95% CI 14·8–18·1) for the ENCO300 
group. Supplementary Table 1 provides the duration of progression-free survival by summary 
of the observed follow-for each patient and by reverse Kaplan-Meier analysis 
 
Median progression-free survival assessed by BICR was longer for patients in the COMBO450 
group (14·9 months [95% CI 11·0–18·5]) compared with either the VEM (7·3 months [95% CI 
5·6–8·2]) or ENCO300 (9.6 months [95% CI 7·5–14·8]) groups.  
  
14 
 
The primary comparison of progression-free survival by BICR of the COMBO450 vs VEM 
groups showed a statistically significant 46% reduction in the risk of progression or death (HR 
0·54 [95% CI 0·41–0·71]; 2-sided p<0·001; Figure 2A). Median progression-free survival by 
local assessment was similar: 14·8 months (95% CI 10·4–18·4), 7·3 months (95% CI 5·7–8·5), 
and 9·2 months (95% CI 7·4–12·9) in the COMBO450, VEM, and ENCO300 groups, 
respectively. Progression-free survival by local review was similarly improved with COMBO450 
vs VEM (HR 0·49 [95% CI 0·37–0·64]; 2-sided nominal p<0·001; Supplementary Figure 1). 
All subgroup analyses for the comparison of COMBO450 with VEM demonstrated point 
estimates in favor of the COMBO450 group, except for the presence of brain metastases at 
baseline, but this analysis included only 9 patients in the COMBO450 group and 3 in the VEM 
group (Figure 3). 
 
The secondary comparison of progression-free survival by BICR of the COMBO450 group with 
the ENCO300 group showed a 25% reduction in risk of progression or death in favour of the 
combination arm that did not reach statistical significance (HR 0·75 [95% CI 0·56–1·00] 2-sided 
p=0·051; Figure 2B). Progression-free survival by local assessment showed a slightly larger 
treatment effect in favour of COMBO450 compared with ENCO300 (HR 0·68 [95% CI 0·52–
0·90]; 2-sided nominal p=0·006; Supplementary Figure 1B). Comparison of progression-free 
survival by BICR favoured the ENCO300 group over the VEM group (HR 0·68 [95% CI 0·52–
0·90]; 2-sided nominal p=0·007); similar results were obtained by local assessment 
(Supplementary Figure 2).

A confirmed overall response by BICR occurred in 121 patients (63%) in the COMBO450 group 
compared with 98 (51%) in the ENCO300 group and 77 (40%) in the VEM group (Table 2). The 
confirmed overall response by local review had a similar pattern but was higher in each group 
(COMBO450 group: 144 [75%]; ENCO300 group: 112 [58%]; VEM group: 94 [49%]). Median 
duration of confirmed objective response by BICR was 16·6 months (95% CI 12·2–20·4) for 
COMBO450, 14·9 months (95% CI 11·1–not estimable) for ENCO300, and 12·3 months (95% 
CI 6·9–16·9) for VEM. A confirmed complete response by BICR was achieved by 15 (8%), 10 
(5%), and 11 patients (6%) in the COMBO450, ENCO300, and VEM groups, respectively. By 
local review, confirmed complete response occurred in 31 (16%), 17 (9%), and 14 patients (7%) 
in the COMBO450, ENCO300, and VEM groups, respectively. 
 
In the COMBO450 group, the median duration of exposure for each component of the 
combination was similar, 51·2 weeks (IQR 27·1–79·7) for encorafenib and 50·6 weeks (IQR 
26·1–79·7) for binimetinib. Median duration of exposure was 31·4 weeks (IQR 16·6–69·1) in 
the ENCO300 group and 27·1 weeks (IQR 15·1–48·3) in the VEM group. The median dose 
intensities in COMBO450 for encorafenib and binimetinib were 100% (IQR 93–100%) and 
99·6% (IQR 80–100%) of planned doses, respectively. Median dose intensity was 86% (IQR 
55–100%) of the planned dose for ENCO300 and 94% (IQR 74–100%) for VEM. The 
distribution of dose intensity for each treatment group is presented in Supplementary Figure 3. 
Most patients in the COMBO450 arm were able to achieve a dose intensity between 80% and 
100% (152 [79%] for encorafenib and 144 [75%] for binimetinib), and few patients receiving the 
combination received less than 50% dose intensity (5 [3%] for encorafenib and 11 [6%] for 
binimetinib). In contrast, 98 patients (51%) and 116 patients (62%) in the ENCO300 and VEM 
  
16 
arms, respectively, achieved a dose intensity between 80% and 100%, and 42 (22%) and 13 
(7%), respectively, achieved less than 50% dose intensity. 
 
A total of 192 patients were evaluable for safety in both the COMB450 and ENCO300 groups; 
186 patients were evaluable in the VEM group. Adverse events of grade 1 or 2 occurring in at 
least 10% of patients and grade 3 or 4 occurring in at least 2% of patients in any treatment group 
are summarized in Table 3. Common adverse events reported more frequently (at a rate of at 
least 10% higher) with COMBO450 than with ENCO300 or VEM included gastrointestinal 
toxicities (diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, and abdominal pain), predominantly asymptomatic 
increases in creatine phosphokinase, and blurred vision. Common adverse events reported at a 
lower frequency (at a rate of at least 10% lower) with COMBO450 than with ENCO300 or VEM 
were skin toxicities (including pruritus, hyperkeratosis, rash, keratosis pilaris, palmoplantar 
keratoderma, palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, dry skin, skin papilloma, 
macropapular rash, and sunburn), alopecia, photosensitivity reaction, arthralgia, myalgia, pain in 
the extremity, decreased appetite, musculoskeletal pain, and decreased weight. Grade 3/4 adverse 
events were reported in fewer patients with COMBO450 (111 [58%]) than with either ENCO300 
(127 [66%]) or VEM (118 [63%]). 
 
The median time to first grade 3 or 4 toxicity in all patients evaluable for safety was longer with 
COMBO450 (8·4 months [95% CI 6·1–11·8]) compared with ENCO300 (2.8 months [95% CI 
1·2–5·8]) or VEM (3·7 months [95% CI 2·4–6·5]; Supplementary Figure 4A). Similarly, 
adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation and leading to dose reduction or interruption 
were lower with COMBO450 than with either ENCO300 or VEM; time to adverse event–related 
  
17 
treatment discontinuation was longer with COMBO450 than with ENCO300 or VEM 
(Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 4B). 
 
Toxicities known to be associated with available BRAF and MEK inhibitors were further 
explored by grouping individually reported adverse events representing similar clinical entities 
or pathophysiologic processes. These included pyrexia, rash, photosensitivity, secondary 
nonmelanoma skin cancers (including squamous cell cancer and basal cell carcinoma), serous 
retinopathy (including retinal pigment epithelial detachment), left ventricular dysfunction, and 
liver function test abnormalities (Supplementary Table 2). A toxicity associated with 
dabrafenib,9,17 pyrexia (including increased body temperature, hyperpyrexia, and hyperthermia), 
occurred in 35 patients (18%) with COMBO450, 30 (16%) with ENCO300, and 55 (30%) with 
VEM. Pyrexia was grade 1 or 2 in 27 patients (14%), 28 patients (15%), and 55 patients (30%) in 
the COMBO450, ENCO300, VEM groups, respectively. Generally, skin toxicities, including 
rash, acneiform dermatitis, and palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, occurred less 
frequently with COMBO450 than with ENCO300 or VEM. Photosensitivity, a toxicity 
associated with vemurafenib,10,14 was seen in 56 patients (30%) with VEM, 9 (5%) with 
COMBO450, and 8 (4%) with ENCO300. Secondary nonmelanoma skin cancers occurred 
infrequently. The most common were squamous cell cancers, in 5 patients (3%) with 
COMBO450, 15 (8%) with ENCO300 and 32 (17%) with VEM. Specific MEK inhibitor 
toxicities, including serous retinopathy and left ventricular dysfunction, were seen more 
frequently in the COMBO450 group than either the ENCO300 or VEM groups. Serous 
retinopathy occurred in 38 (20%), 4 (2%), and 3 patients (2%) treated with COMBO450, 
ENCO300, and VEM, respectively. The majority of events in the COMBO450 group were grade 
1 (23 [12%]) or grade 2 (10 [5%]) and resulted in dose interruption/adjustment in 11 patients 
  
18 
(6%) but did not result in treatment discontinuations. Left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 15 
(8%), 4 (2%), and 1 patient (1%) with COMBO450, ENCO300, and VEM treatment, 
respectively. In the COMBO450 group, the majority of left ventricular dysfunction was grade 1 
(4 [2%]) or 2 (8 [4%]), led to dose interruption/adjustment in 12 patients (6%), was generally 
reversible, and did not result in treatment discontinuations. Elevated aspartate aminotransferase 
or alanine aminotransferase of grade 3 were reported in 13 (7%), 3 (2%), and 3 patients (2%) 
treated with COMBO450, ENCO300, and VEM, respectively. No grade 3 or 4 bilirubin 
elevations occurred in any treatment group.   
 
Despite the longer duration of exposure in the COMBO450 group, the number of deaths that 
occurred during treatment or within 30 days of the last dose was similar among the 3 treatment 
groups: 17 (9%), 14 (7%), and 19 patients (10%) in the COMBO450, ENCO300, and VEM 
groups, respectively. On-treatment deaths were due to disease progression in 11 (6%), 12 (6%), 
and 17 patients (9%) in the COMBO450, ENCO300, and VEM groups, respectively. None of the 
deaths due to adverse events were considered likely to be related to study treatment 
(Supplementary Table 3).  
 
Discussion 
COMBO450 demonstrated a favourable efficacy and safety profile compared with VEM 
monotherapy in this phase 3, randomised trial in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. 
Progression-free survival with COMBO450 treatment was significantly longer than with VEM, 
which had progression-free survival consistent with that demonstrated in previous trials using 
VEM as the control in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma.9,10 COMBO450 improved median 
progression-free survival versus ENCO300, although results by blinded independent assessment 
  
19 
did not meet statistical significance (p=0·051). Overall response, complete response, and 
duration of response also were improved with COMBO450 relative to VEM and ENCO300. In 
addition, the tolerability profile of COMBO450 was favourable compared with VEM or 
ENCO300 monotherapy, as reflected in the higher dose intensity achieved and the longer median 
exposure to treatment in the COMBO450 group. The adverse event profile was also favourable, 
with fewer grade 3 or 4 toxicities, fewer toxicities requiring dose interruption or modification, a 
later time to onset of grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and fewer adverse event–related treatment 
discontinuations. 
 
The mechanistic underpinnings of efficacy and safety for the various BRAF/MEK inhibitor 
combinations likely rest on the particular characteristics of the individual agents. Encorafenib 
inhibits BRAF V600E kinase activity in a biochemical assay at similar concentrations as 
dabrafenib and vemurafenib but with a dissociation half-life of more than 30 hours versus 2 
hours with dabrafenib and 0·5 hours with vemurafenib, resulting in improved pharmacodynamics 
with prolonged pERK inhibition.18 Further, in BRAFV600-mutant cell lines, encorafenib was 
more potent at inhibiting proliferation compared with dabrafenib or vemurafenib.18 
 
Previous studies suggest that the maximum monotherapy dose of encorafenib was defined as 300 
mg/d.18 In combination with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib, however, the toxicities and overall 
tolerability of encorafenib when administered as a monotherapy are substantially ameliorated. 
This allows the use of the higher 450-mg dose of encorafenib in the combination, thus potentially 
providing greater and more prolonged pathway inhibition.18 Consistent with these earlier results, 
this study confirmed the ability to safely increase the dose intensity of encorafenib in the 
combination. 
  
20 
 
In the phase 3 COMBI-d trial and COMBI-v trials, median progression-free survival for 
dabrafenib/trametinib was 11·0 months (95% CI 8·0–13·9) and 11·4 months (95% CI 9·9–14·9), 
respectively.8,9,27 Median progression-free survival for vemurafenib/cobimetinib in the phase 3 
coBRIM study was 12·3 months (95% CI 9·5–13·4).10 In the current study, COMBO450 was 
associated with a median progression-free survival of 14·9 months (95% CI 11·0–18·5), the 
longest median progression-free survival observed to date with any BRAF/MEK inhibitor 
combination. Although cross-trial comparisons may be confounded by differences in patient 
populations, vemurafenib has served as a common control group across trials for all available 
BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations, and its performance across those trials and in this study 
were nearly identical. In the COMBI-v and coBRIM studies, median progression-free survival 
was 7·3 months (95% CI 5·8–7·8) and 7·2 months (95% CI 5·6–7·5), respectively,9,10,27 
compared with 7·3 months (95% CI 5·6–8·2) by BICR and 7·3 months (95% CI 5·7–8·5) by 
local review in this study. This suggests that despite differences in individual baseline prognostic 
factors, such as the proportion of patients with elevated lactate dehydrogenase, the populations 
across these trials are similar overall with respect to their expected response to treatment. In 
addition, the improved efficacy of ENCO300 compared with VEM within this trial supports the 
hypothesis that prolonged pathway inhibition can lead to improved clinical outcomes. A direct 
comparison of COMBO450 with other BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations would be needed for 
confirmation. 
 
Although these currently available BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations present largely 
overlapping toxicity profiles, each is associated with a specific toxicity: pyrexia with 
dabrafenib/trametinib and photosensitivity with vemurafenib/cobimetinib.28,29 Both of these 
  
21 
toxicities are infrequent with COMBO450. Pyrexia is the most frequent adverse event with the 
dabrafenib and trametinib combination (in more than 50% of patients) and a leading cause of 
discontinuation, dose interruption, and dose reduction.9,17 Some patients experienced multiple 
episodes of pyrexia, with episodes having a median duration of 3 days and, in some cases, 
requiring prophylactic treatment with glucocorticoids.17 Photosensitivity reactions (47%) are 
common with the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib.10,14,30 Photosensitivity is noted 
as requiring patient education and prospective and ongoing management by patients and clinical 
staff to mitigate effects.10 In the current study, COMBO450 was associated with all-grade 
adverse events of interest of pyrexia in 35 patients (18%) and photosensitivity in 9 patients (5%). 
Pyrexia was qualitatively different from that observed with dabrafenib and trametinib; it 
generally was low grade, not recurrent, and most often associated with intercurrent illness or 
progressive disease.   
 
This study has several limitations. Few patients had received prior immunotherapy; the ongoing 
SECOMBIT (NCT02631447), EORTC 1612 (NCT03235245), and IMMU-TARGET 
(NCT02902042) studies are formally testing the optimal approach for sequencing 
immunotherapy with ipilimumab/nivolumab or pembrolizumab with encorafenib/binimetinib. It 
is anticipated that these and other studies will determine the optimal combinations and sequences 
that will further improve outcomes for patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. 
 
In addition, this study did not have comparator arms for the available BRAF/MEK inhibitor 
combinations, limiting the ability to make direct comparisons. The comparator, vemurafenib, 
however, was used across all combinations and performed similarly across the trials, providing a 
common benchmark.9,10 The benefit of COMBO450 will be further defined with longer follow-
  
22 
up for progression-free survival. In prior BRAF-mutant melanoma trials, progression-free 
survival at first readout was 9·3 to 11·4 months, whereas more mature progression-free survival, 
reported about 1 year later, was about 2 months longer at 11·0 to 12·6 months.8-10,14-16 Further 
follow-up of this study will determine whether a similar pattern will be observed. Finally, overall 
survival data, when it becomes available, will provide additional insights into the efficacy of 
COMBO450. 
 
In conclusion, results of the COLUMBUS study demonstrate that COMBO450 improved 
progression-free survival compared with VEM and showed improvements in response and other 
secondary endpoints compared with ENCO300. Overall, COMBO450 had better tolerability 
compared with ENCO300 or VEM. COMBO450 represents a new treatment option for patients 
with BRAF-mutant melanoma.

Panel: Research in context 
Evidence before this study 
We carefully reviewed articles and abstracts during the development of this manuscript identified 
via PubMed and Embase searches published between January 1, 2014, and December 20, 2017. 
Search terms were comprehensive (melanoma + treatment + phase [all fields]; encorafenib, 
BRAF inhibition + melanoma [all fields]). Selected abstracts were not limited to the English 
language and focused on phase 3 clinical trial data. Our search results indicate that combined the 
BRAF (dabrafenib and vemurafenib) and MEK (cobimetinib and trametinib) pathway inhibitors 
generate benefit in advanced melanoma in comparison to monotherapy. Preclinical and early 
clinical phase I and II data suggest that encorafenib in combination with binimetinib could be a 
new promising treatment option for patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. 
 
Added value of this study 
In this prospective, randomised trial in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma, treatment with the 
combination of encorafenib 450 mg and binimetinib 45 mg improved progression-free survival 
  
27 
and overall response compared with encorafenib 300 mg or vemurafenib, with better tolerability. 
For the first time, the head-to-head comparison of encorafenib 300 mg or vemurafenib showed a 
progression-free survival advantage for encorafenib supporting preclinical observations and a 
more profound pathway inhibition results in improved tumor control 
 
Implications of all the available evidence 
Encorafenib 450 mg in combination with binimetinib is a well-tolerated and efficacious 
treatment option for BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma.
