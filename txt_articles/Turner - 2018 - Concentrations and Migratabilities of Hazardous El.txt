ABSTRACT: About 200 second-hand plastic toys sourced in the UK have been
analyzed by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry for hazardous elements (As, Ba, Cd, Cr,
Hg, Pb, Sb, Se) and Br as a proxy for brominated flame retardants. Each element was
detected in >20 toys or components thereof with the exception of As, Hg, and Se,
with the frequent occurrence of Br, Cd, and Pb and at maximum concentrations of
about 16000, 20000, and 5000 μg g−1, respectively, of greatest concern from a
potential exposure perspective. Migration was evaluated on components of 26 toys
under simulated stomach conditions (0.07 M HCl) with subsequent analysis by
inductively coupled plasma spectrometry. In eight cases, Cd or Pb exceeded their
migration limits as stipulated by the current EU Toy Safety Directive (17 and 23 μg
g−1, respectively), with Cd released from yellow and red Lego bricks exceeding its
limit by 1 order of magnitude. Two further cases were potentially noncompliant based
on migratable Cr, with one item also containing >250 μg g−1 migratable Br. While
there is no retroactive regulation on second-hand toys, consumers should be aware that old, mouthable, plastic items may present
a source of hazardous element exposure to infants.
■ INTRODUCTION
Mounting evidence for their acute and chronic toxicities at
relatively low doses has resulted in increasingly restricted use of
many heavy metals and metalloids in consumer products over
the past few decades.1,2 Young children are particularly
susceptible to the health impacts of such elements because of
their higher metabolic rate, greater surface area to weight ratio,
more rapid growth of organs and tissues, and longer time
period to develop diseases with latency periods compared with
adults.3 Infants are also potentially exposed to greater quantities
of metals and metalloids in consumer products through the
mouthing of nonfood objects as they seek oral stimulation and
explore taste, texture, and shape. Consequently, products
designed to be used by (or in contact with) young children
have received particularly stringent regulatory attention in
terms of both the concentrations and migratabilities of toxic
chemicals in accessible components.
The original European Council Directive 88/378/EEC on
toy safety4 stipulated migratable limits for eight hazardous
elements, listed in Table 1, that are based on the ingestion of a
small quantity of material and defined by 2 h extraction under
simulated gastric conditions (dilute HCl at 37 °C) according to
the European standard, EN 71-3.5 An amended directive that
applied to products placed on the market from July 2013
provided revised limits on migration in dilute HCl that
depended on the matrix being tested (liquid or sticky; brittle,
powder-like, or pliable; material that can be scraped off) (see
Table 1), as well as limits for an additional number of elements
and different oxidation states of Cr.6 Precise concentration
limits for some elements have since been revised downward in
line with new scientific data, and there is currently a proposal to
substantially reduce the concentration limits of Pb because of a
growing body of scientific evidence that suggests there is no
lower threshold of safety for its levels in blood.7

 While the current Toy Safety Directive applies to new
products, there is no retroactive regulation on the recycling or
resale of older toys. Second-hand toys are an attractive option
because they can be inherited directly from relatives and friends
or obtained cheaply and readily from charity stores, flea
markets, and the internet.8 Moreover, in the UK the reuse of
working, old, and outgrown toys is actively encouraged through
the Toy Recycling in Your Community (“Tric”) scheme.9
Whereas liquid or sticky toys have a limited shelf life and
parents are likely to be wary of second-hand toys that are brittle
or have visibly flaking paint, old plastic products often appear to
be in good condition, presumably because of the durability of
synthetic polymers and the color-fastness of many pigments,
and tend to be reused more extensively.
Despite the market for second-hand plastic toys and their
abundance in homes, waiting rooms, day-care centers, and
nurseries,8 there has been little scientific study of the presence
of hazardous elements in such items. Specifically, two studies
conducted in the US and employing a hand-held X-ray
fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer report total concentrations
of Pb in a variety of vintage plastic toys from day centers and
family homes that exceeded US limits of 100 μg g−1, but
migration from the matrix was not evaluated.8,10 Other metals
and metalloids, including As, Ba, Cd, and Cr, are mentioned in
the latter study, but none of these elements have US mandatory
limits in toys with the exception of Cd in jewelry.
The present study describes the first systematic investigation
of the occurrence and migratability of hazardous elements in
second-hand plastic toys in the UK. Portable XRF was used to
determine the concentrations of the eight elements listed in the
original toy Safety Directive (and defined in Table 1) in
addition to Br as a proxy for brominated flame retardants
(BFRs) and whose concentration is limited in electronic plastic
waste according to EU Directive 2002/95/EC.11 On the basis
of the XRF results, selected samples were subjected to
extraction in dilute HCl in order to evaluate element
migratability and potential for exposure through ingestion.
■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Sample Collection and Categorization. About 200 toys
that were designed for young children, containing parts that
were small or accessible enough to be mouthed in part or in
whole and that had been acquired second-hand or second-
generation, were sourced from two preschool nurseries, a
primary school, various charity shops, and five family homes
within the city of Plymouth, southwest England. Toys were
constructed entirely or largely of synthetic, molded plastic (and
not foam, rubber, or textile) and excluded products that housed
electrical parts or that had been painted. Products and distinct
components thereof (e.g., different colored blocks, various body
parts of figures, separate constituents of games and puzzles) are
listed in Table S1 of the Supporting Information where they are
categorized as follows: “activity” (balls, marbles, yo yos, tools,
letters), “cars and trains” (and other toys with wheels, plus
accessories), “construction” (blocks and studded bricks), “food-
related” (bottle caps, cutlery, crockery, model food), “figures”
(animals, dinosaurs, dolls, characters), “games and puzzles”
(board games, shape sorters, numeracy toys), “jewelry” (straps,
beads, rings) “sound-generating” (rattles, whistles, bells, musical
instruments), and “water” (mainly bath toys).
XRF Analysis. Toys and components were analyzed by
energy-dispersive FP-XRF using a Niton XL3t 950 He GOLDD
+ that was configured nose-upward in the laboratory and in a
4000 cm3 Thermo Scientific accessory stand. The instrument
was operated in a low-density, “plastics” mode with thickness
correction down to 50 μm. A suite of elements may be
determined in this mode, but the present study focuses on the
eight metals and metalloids defined in the original Toy Safety
Directive (listed in Table 1) and that are generally regarded as
most hazardous for children12 as well as Cl and Br as indicators
of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and BFRs, respectively.
Where possible, sample thickness was determined through
the measurement surface using 300 mm Allendale digital
calipers, while for hollow objects (mainly dolls, balls, model
food, and sound-generating items) thickness was estimated
from accessible surfaces of objects of similar construction and
rigidity. Samples were placed on the stainless steel base plate of
the accessory stand with the measurement surface above the
XRF detector window before analyses with appropriate
thickness correction and collimation (3 mm or 8 mm beam
width depending on the accessibility and homogeneity of the
area to be probed) were activated remotely through a laptop for
counting periods of 40 s at 50 kV/40 μA (main energy) and up
to 30 s at 20 kV/100 μA (low energy). Spectra were quantified
by fundamental parameters yielding elemental concentrations
in parts per million (μg g−1) and with a counting error of 2σ
that were downloaded to the laptop via Niton data transfer
(NDT) software.
Measurement detection limits (as 3σ) varied depending on
sample thickness and composition, but median values based on
counting errors arising from analyses that failed to deliver a
concentration ranged from <10 μg g−1 for As, Br, and Pb to
about 300 μg g−1 for Ba. (A complete list of detection limits can
be found in Table S1.) Polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride
(PVC) reference disks of 13 mm thickness and that had been
impregnated with As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Sb, and Se (PN 180-
619, Lot No. T-81), Cd, Cr, Br, Hg and Pb (PN 180-554, batch
SN PE-071-N) or Br and Sb (PVC-4C80) were analyzed at
regular intervals throughout each measurement session and
returned concentrations that were always within 10% of mean
certified values. A detailed comparison of metal concentrations
in plastics derived by portable XRF and, as an independent
measure, by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometry
following digestion in H2SO4 is given elsewhere.13
Sample Extraction. On the basis of the results of XRF
analysis, and subject to sufficient accessible material and
permission to sacrifice, 34 components of 26 plastic toys
(and as described in Table S1) were extracted in dilute HCl
according to EN 71-3 for scraped off material.5 Hard plastics
were fractionated to <2 mm through a stainless steel grater,
with 100−300 mg of material collected on white A4 paper
subsequently transferred to a series of preweighed 50 mL
polypropylene centrifuge tubes with the aid of a Nylon brush;
softer plastics (mainly PVC) or thin items were cut into small
(<5 mm) pieces using stainless steel scissors or a scalpel before
being transferred to centrifuge tubes likewise. Ten milliliters of
a solution of 0.07 M HCl, simulating the human gastric
environment and prepared by dilution of Fisher Scientific Trace
Analysis grade acid in Elga ultrapure water, was then pipetted
into each tube and the screw-capped contents inverted twice
before being placed in a water bath at 37 °C for 2 h (1 h under
lateral agitation and 1 h without agitation). At the end of the
incubations, 5 mL from each tube was filtered through
Whatman 0.45 μm PES syringe-cartridge filters into 10 mL
polypropylene centrifuge tubes and diluted to 10 mL with 0.07
M HCl.

 Extract Analysis. Within 24 h of preparation, extracts were
analyzed for As, Ba, Br, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Sb, and Se by ICP mass
spectrometry using a Thermo X-series II (Thermo Elemental,
Winsford UK) with a concentric glass nebulizer and conical
spray chamber. The instrument was calibrated externally using
five mixed standards prepared by serial dilution of mixed

and internally by the addition of 10 μg L−1 of 115In and 193Ir to
all samples, standards, and blanks. RF power was set at 1400 W,
and coolant, auxiliary, nebulizer, and collision cell gas flows
rates were 13 L Ar min−1, 0.70 L Ar min−1, 0.75 L Ar min−1,
and 3.5 mL 7% H2 in He min−1, respectively. Data were
acquired over a dwell period of 10 ms, with 50 sweeps per
reading and three replicates. Limits of detection, based on three
standard deviations about multiple measurements of blanks,
ranged from 0.05 μg L−1 for Cd and Pb to about 10 μg L−1 for
Br. Analyses of a reference drinking water (EP-L-2; SPC
Science, Quebec) after every 10 samples revealed analyte
concentrations that were within 10% of certified values with the
exception of Sb (within 15%).
■ RESULTS
Sample Categorization and Elemental Concentra-
tions. The number and categorization of plastic toys and
components considered in the present study are summarized in
Table 2. Thus, 285 XRF analyses were performed on 197
products, with multiple measurements undertaken on distinctly
different components of various toys like the wheels, base and
body of a car, different colored blocks in a set, and the
constituent parts of a puzzle or game. Overall, 28 products were
constructed of PVC (defined by the XRF as having a Cl content
greater than 15% by weight, 14), with the majority of this
polymer encountered in the figures and water categories. Also
shown in Table 2 are the number of measurements in which
each hazardous element was detected by XRF. Thus, Hg was
not detected in the products analyzed, and the sequence of
decreasing number of cases detected among the remaining
elements was Ba > Br/Cr > Sb > Cd/Pb > As > Se, with Ba and
Br encountered across all categories considered. Hazardous
elements were most frequently detected among plastic figures,
construction toys, games and puzzles, and jewelry, where on
average, more than one element was detected per measure-
ment, and detection was least frequent among activity products,
cars and trains, and toys designed for use in water.
The total concentrations of each element, where detected by
XRF, are illustrated in Figure 1 in ascending order, with PVC-
and non-PVC-based materials discriminated and statistical
summaries for each data set annotated. Also shown is the
number of cases in which total concentrations exceed the
respective migratable limits defined by Directive 2009/48/EC
and its subsequent amendments (see Table 1). (Note that the
higher migratable limit for Cr in its lower oxidation state is
shown, and while Br is not included in the Toy Safety Directive,
the value presented is based on the Restriction of Hazardous

 Substances concentration limit for certain brominated flame
retardants, but not total Br, in electronic plastics; 11.) While the
two measures are not directly comparable, total concentrations
that exceed migratable limits should act as a trigger for further
investigation of a product. Thus, overall, there were 73 cases of
exceedance, encompassing 49 measurements and 31 products
(of which seven were PVC-based) from all categories with the
exception of toys designed for water. Co-associations of
multiple elements exceeding their respective limit values were
encountered in two types of beads (Br−Cd−Pb−Sb), a number
of Lego bricks (Cd−Se or Cr−Sb), a small games mat (Ba−
Pb), various games counters (Cd−Se) and figures (Cd−Pb),
and the plastic bowl of a bell (Cr−Sb).
Hazardous Element Migratability. Extraction tests were
performed on 34 components of 26 toys that could be
sacrificed and that were homogeneous, readily accessible and
yielded sufficient quantities of plastic material on grating or
slicing. These included many of the items where the XRF
returned one or more hazardous element above its correspond-
ing EU Directive migration limit (Table 1) in order to ascertain
compliance/noncompliance and samples of lower elemental
concentrations but of a variety of color and type in order to
explore possible controls on and variations in migratability.
Significantly, and despite constraints on the amount of material
required for extraction, a number of items tested (e.g., small
blocks, counters, and beads) were small enough to be ingested
whole.
Table 3 presents results for all samples in which at least one
element was detected in the extract by ICP (n = 30) in terms of
both weight-normalized migratable concentration and percent-
age migration relative to total elemental content (i.e., a measure
of bioaccessibility). Note that where the element was detected
in the extract but not by XRF, a lower limit of bioaccessibility is
given that is based on the detection limit returned by the Niton
XL3t (and as shown in Table S1). Thus, while As and Se were
never detected in the extracts, Ba and Cd were encountered in
30 and 11 cases, respectively, and in a variety of toys.
Migratable concentrations ranged from <1 μg g−1 for Cd in two
components to >100 μg g−1 for Ba, Br, Cd, Pb, and Sb in at
least one case each, and bioaccessibility ranged from below 1%
for Ba, Cd, and Cr in a number of products to over 10% for Cr
in a molded food toy and Pb in a black bead. Among the
elements considered, and despite variations in percentage
bioaccessibility, statistically significant correlations between
migratable concentrations and total concentrations were
exhibited by Cd (n = 11, r = 0.825, p = 0.002) and Pb (n =
7, r = 0.972, p < 0.001).
With respect to the current EU Directive, noncompliance
occurred for Cd in four yellow or red building bricks from two
Lego sets and for Pb in two body parts of a PVC-based model
dinosaur and on both surfaces of a child’s PVC tape measure.
Although concentrations of extractable Cr were compliant in
respect of total migration, it is suspected that a number of
brightly colored items or parts (a building block, model
dinosaur and tape measure) and a black bead were non-
compliant in respect of Cr(VI) since the coassociation of Cr
and Pb suggests the presence of the pigment, lead chromate.
Overall, therefore, various components from four toys were
noncompliant, with a further two products potentially non-
compliant.
■ DISCUSSION
The results of the present study reveal high concentrations of
many elements listed by the original EU 88/3781/EEC Toy
Safety Directive4 in products that remain in circulation, being
handed-down by parents, recycled via charity shops, and
donated to nurseries, hospitals, and schools. Both the
frequencies of detection and median elemental concentrations
are greater than corresponding values for new plastic toys
sourced from major retailers15,16 but are more in line with
measurements reported for new, low cost items purchased from
bargain stores and roadside vendors.16−18 Regarding older
plastic toys, similar conclusions to the present study have been
reached for Pb in toys in day care centers in Nevada10 and for
several hazardous metals in products purchased in the 1970s
and 1980s in the USA but whose precise source was not
specified.8 The latter studies, however, implicitly relate
exposure and health hazard to total elemental concentrations
in plastic, in line with current US restrictions, rather than
migratable levels. The results shown in Table 3 clearly indicate
a wide variation in bioaccessibility on a percentage basis for any
given element, with correlations between total and migratable
concentrations significant only for Cd and Pb. Presumably, this
reflects variations in product composition, age, and usage but
suggests that total concentration is not, necessarily, a good
proxy for exposure though ingestion.
Elemental concentrations extracted by dilute HCl in this
study that exceed current or proposed EU migratable limits
include Cd and Pb (and potentially Cr) in various building
blocks and bricks and in PVC figures. In these products, Pb
appears to have been employed in compounds used as
stabilizers in PVC or, in association with Cr(VI), as the
brightly colored yellow pigment, PbCrO4, whose precise hue
may be varied through to red by addition of PbMoO4 or
PbSO4.19 Cadmium was evident as a stabilizer in one PVC-
based component (the black caterpillar track from an
excavating vehicle) but was more generally encountered in a
variety of brightly colored toys. Here, the compound CdS, or a
mixture of CdS and ZnS, is likely to have been employed as a
yellow pigment, with successively darker hues of orange and red
effected by the progressive replacement of S by Se.19 Consistent
with this assertion, Se was absent from all yellow toys that were
Cd-positive, while the mass ratio of Cd:Se increased from about
4 in an orange games cup to about 7.3 in a dark red counter.
Cadmium- and Pb-based pigments found widespread use in
plastics because of their pure, brilliant shades, opacity, light-
fastness, and weather-resistance and, at least when new, high
chemical resistance and little tendency to migrate.20 Accord-
ingly, such pigments had a key role in the manufacture of
colorful toys before health and environmental concerns resulted
in their restriction and replacement by safer organic and
inorganic alternatives. Of the toys analyzed in the present study,
the highest levels of total and migratable Cd were encountered
in some, but not all, red and yellow studded Lego bricks.
Specifically, those in sets that appear to have been purchased in
the 1970s yielded migratable Cd concentrations that sometimes
exceeded the EU migration limit by an order of magnitude,
while those purchased in the 1990s, and that were visually
indistinguishable from the older bricks, contained no detectable
Cd. The introduction of high quantities of Cd in Lego bricks is
likely to have coincided with the introduction of acrylonitrile
butadiene styrene (ABS) as a replacement for cellulose acetate
as the material of construction in the 1960s21 since Cd

 sulfoselenides were favorable colorants for styrenic-based
polymers at the time;22 when, precisely, Cd-based chemicals
in Lego were subsequently replaced by safer pigments,
however, is unclear. Given their popularity, durability,
collectability, and compatibility with newer products, older,
ABS-based Lego sets, and in particular those containing brightly
colored pieces, should be treated with caution.
One element not embraced by the original or amended Toy
Safety Directive but of concern from a health perspective is Br.
Although the halogen is found in the organic pigment, copper
phthalocyanine green 36, that has limited use in plastics,23 its
most important application in synthetic polymers is as a
constituent of free-radical-scavenging BFRs. These chemicals
represent a wide variety of organic compounds designed to
increase resistance to ignition and slow down developing fires
in heat-generating materials like electronic casings and
construction materials. Because many commonly employed
BFRs are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic, their use in new
and recycled electrical products is restricted according to EU
Directive 2002/95/EC.11 Accordingly, and given the practical
and analytical difficulties in discriminating BFRs (including
those that are unregulated; 24), Br should be absent from
nonelectrical plastics that are not pigmented with copper
phthalocyanine.14 That nearly 40 nongreen (and mainly
neutrally colored) products or components thereof were Br-
positive in the present study, and usually at levels well below
those required for flame retardancy (between about 3 and 8%
by weight;24), suggests many children’s toys have been
manufactured, directly or indirectly, from recycled waste
electrical casings. This issue has been highlighted more
generally in new consumer products, including toys,25−27 but
the presence of Br in older toys raises the possibility that
residues of the more hazardous BFRs that were banned 15
years ago and are subject to more stringent regulation, like
polybrominated diphenyl ethers and polybrominated biphenyls,
remain in plastics that are available to young children. Because
of the relatively small molecular weight of most BFRs, they also
have a greater propensity to migrate compared with many other
organic additives.28 This is evident from the extraction of
considerable quantities of Br from an item of jewelry presented
in Table 3.
With the introduction and refinement of the Toy Safety
Directive, the design and development of safer and more
sustainable products, and the publicity generated by new goods
violating chemical standards, there is clearly good reason for the
plastic manufacturing industry to eliminate hazardous elements
from new toys. The latest statistics provided by the US
Consumer Product Safety Commission29 confirm a steady
decline in the number of recalls based on the presence of
hazardous substances, and in particular Pb. However, the
attraction of second-hand products to consumers in terms of
cost, convenience and recyclability is acting as a conduit for
exposing “legacy” chemicals to the current generation of young
children. For consumer products more generally, some
authorities have advocated a “right to know” policy, whereby
goods are labeled should they contain any toxic constituents.3,30
Because of the plethora and variety of old toys on sale or passed
down whose precise ages and origins are unknown, this
approach would be difficult to implement in the current
context. However, a specific recommendation of this
investigation is that consumers should be aware of the potential
risks associated with small, mouthable, and brightly colored
(and in particular red and yellow) old plastic toys or
components. The present study has also provided evidence
for the occurrence of historical BFRs in some second-hand toys
that are neutrally colored; this finding is part of a broader and
more complex issue concerning the recycling of electronic
plastic waste and one that warrants further study.14,31
