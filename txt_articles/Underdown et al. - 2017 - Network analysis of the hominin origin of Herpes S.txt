Abstract
Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) is a human herpesvirus found worldwide that causes genital lesions and more rarely causes
encephalitis. This pathogen is most common in Africa, and particularly in central and east Africa, an area of particular sig-
nificance for the evolution of modern humans. Unlike HSV1, HSV2 has not simply co-speciated with humans from their last
common ancestor with primates. HSV2 jumped the species barrier between 1.4 and 3 MYA, most likely through intermedi-
ate but unknown hominin species. In this article, we use probability-based network analysis to determine the most proba-
ble transmission path between intermediate hosts of HSV2, from the ancestors of chimpanzees to the ancestors of modern
humans, using paleo-environmental data on the distribution of African tropical rainforest over the last 3 million years and
data on the age and distribution of fossil species of hominin present in Africa between 1.4 and 3 MYA. Our model identifies
Paranthropus boisei as the most likely intermediate host of HSV2, while Homo habilis may also have played a role in the initial
transmission of HSV2 from the ancestors of chimpanzees to P.boisei.

1. Introduction
Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) is a sexually transmitted human
pathogen that causes genital lesions and, rarely, encephalitis
(Tang et al. 2003), and is associated with increased risk of HIV
acquisition (Freeman et al. 2006). After primary infection, the vi-
rus adopts a life cycle of latency punctuated by periods of lytic
replication when new hosts can be infected through genital
contact. The virus is related to the human oral pathogen herpes
simplex virus 1 (HSV1). Both HSV1 and 2 are alphaherpesvi-
ruses, which are found in many primates (Wertheim et al. 2014).
HSV1 primarily causes infection, and sporadic lesions, within
the oral cavity and establishes latency in the trigeminal ganglia,
while HSV2 is associated with infection of the genitalia and sur-
rounding skin, and establishes latency in the sacral ganglia
(Whitley et al. 2007). Both simplex viruses can infect either body
cavity, although there is viral shedding data from co-infected
individuals to suggest that HSV1 is a more successful oral and
HSV2 a more successful genital pathogen (Kim et al. 2006).
The genetic basis of this difference in tropism isn’t fully under-
stood, some studies of recombinant HSV1 � HSV2 strains have

 highlighted the importance of the latency-associated transcript
in how successfully the two simplex viruses reactivate from la-
tency within different nerve types (Bertke et al. 2007). HSV1 and
2 also differ in the length of the glycoprotein G (US4) open read-
ing frame, which may play a role in tropism (Baines and Pellett
2007).
HSV2 was originally thought to have co-speciated with hu-
mans when our lineage diverged from that of the ancestors of
chimpanzees and bonobos (anc-chimps). Comparisons of the
HSV1, HSV2 and chimpanzee herpes virus 1 (ChHV1) genomes
(Tang et al. 2003) suggest that HSV2 is more closely related to
ChHV1 than HSV1 (Wertheim et al. 2014). This analysis also
found that ChHV1 and HSV2 diverged from one another be-
tween 1.4 and 3 MYA, and the authors inferred that an un-
known hominin (or hominins) was infected with HSV2 before it
switched host to the ancestors of modern humans.
We hypothesise that by combining fossil data on when and
where different hominin species were likely to be present in
Africa, the geographical range of modern chimpanzees and bo-
nobos, and the reconstructed distribution of tropical rainforest
habitat as a proxy for the past range of the chimpanzee/bonobo
ancestor (anc-chimps) it will be possible to develop a model to
statistically infer the species that facilitated the host-switch of
HSV2 in the modern human lineage defined here as beginning
with Homo erectus (Anton et al. 2016). Before H.erectus it is
unclear which hominins are the direct ancestors of anatomi-
cally modern humans (AMH). However, once HSV2 has reached
H.erectus, no further host-switches are required for HSV2 to be
considered present in the ancestors of modern humans.
HSV2 is found in all living populations (Looker et al. 2015), is
accepted as having an African origin (Burrel et al. 2017; Koelle
et al. 2017), and has patterns of genetic divergence consistent
with having diverged with human populations as they spread
out of Africa (Koelle et al. 2017). Current genetic, archaeological
and fossil evidence suggests 100 KYA as a plausible (although not
universally accepted) earliest date for AMH to have left Africa
(Mirazo
´n Lahr et al. 2016). We therefore infer that HSV2 must
have been in the population of AMH before they left Africa, to
take it with them when migrating to the rest of the world.
2. Methods
The process of identifying the most probable intermediary spe-
cies that transmitted proto-HSV2 (henceforth HSV2) from anc-
chimps to modern humans involves four steps: (1) data acquisition,
which involves collecting information on the prevalence of HSV2
in Africa, fossil records of potential intermediary hominins, their
geographical range and time-period, and the extent of tropical
rainforest data, (2) network generation, where a network of possible
transmission paths of HSV2 from anc-chimps to humans through
different hominins is created, (3) probabilistic network analysis,
which involves assigning weights to different transmission paths
on the graph network based on a certain probability distribution,
and (4) optimal path traversal, which evaluates the shortest path
from anc-chimps to modern humans based on the probabilistic
weights assigned to different paths.
2.1 HSV2 prevalence data, hominin fossil data
and chimpanzee and tropical rainforest geographic
range data
HSV2 is most closely related to ChHV1 which infected the an-
cestors of modern chimpanzees. However, only one ancestral-
chimpanzee fossil, dated to c. 500 KYA, is currently known
(McBrearty and Jablonski 2005). This means that the habitat
range of anc-chimps is not directly measurable from the fossil
record but is inferred to be a larger geographical range than that
of modern Pan. We can use the Geographic Information System
(GIS) data on the range of modern Pan troglodytes and Pan panis-
cus, provided by the International Union for Conservation of
Nature (IUCN) Red List (Oates et al. 2008), shown in Fig. 1, to
make some inferences about the range of anc-chimps but a
measure of paleo-tropical rainforest range is likely to be a better
proxy for the range of anc-chimps (Elton 2008). Therefore, we
have used the paleo-tropical rainforest range during the period
of 1.4–3 MYA from the Koppen–Geiger climate classification
dataset (Peel et al. 2007) as a proxy for the ancient range of
chimpanzees and combined this with data based on modern
great ape distribution patterns and range size estimates (Myers
Thompson 2003). This is shown in Fig. 1.
To identify which species could have been involved in the
host-switch of HSV2 from the ancestors of chimpanzees to the
ancestors of modern humans, we collated spatio-temporal data
on African hominin fossil species extant between 100 KYA and
3 MYA. Latitude and longitude of site location was used to pro-
vide a spatial data point for each species. Temporally, published
fossil dating evidence was used to provide a first appearance
datum and last appearance datum (LAD) for each species
(Supplementary Table S1).
Data on the prevalence of HSV2 between 2000 and 2015 CE
was taken from the supplementary materials of Looker et al.
(2015) and plotted to demonstrate the distribution of HSV2
across Africa (Supplementary Fig. S1).
2.2 Network analysis
To establish the most probable transmission path of HSV2 from
anc-chimps to modern humans, it is important to identify po-
tential species that may have been intermediary hosts. Initially,
all hominins in Africa with temporal ranges within the 1.4–3
MYA
confidence
window
(Wertheim
et
al.
2014)
of
the
chimp-hominin transmission were identified (Supplementary
Table S1). Their distance to ancient tropical rainforest was cal-
culated, and only those species whose fossil remains were
found within 400 km of tropical rainforest were considered as
putative species
for initial ancestral–chimp-hominin
HSV2
transmission. This initial threshold on the distance reflects the
distance that would have been covered by hominins employing
three possible strategies: (1) a broadly omnivorous subsistence
strategy based on scavenging, (2) hunting using carnivore and
herbivore movement patterns, and (3) modern hunter-gatherer
range sizes (Foley 1978; Grant et al. 1992). A matrix of spatio-
temporal distances was then calculated to map the distances
between the nearest neighbours of each species and also to cal-
culate the temporal overlap between species using the fossil re-
cord (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Fossils from four genera
(Ardipithecus, Kenyanthropus, Orrorin, and Sahelanthropus) were
excluded from the analysis on the basis that there is no fossil
evidence that they persisted after 3 MYA.
A network of possible transmission paths of HSV2 from anc-
chimps to humans through different hominins was developed
as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) G ¼ (V, E) comprising of a set of
nodes (V), representing potential intermediary hosts, and edges
(E) connecting the nodes, which represents the direction of
transmission between species (Figs 1 and 2). The DAG com-
prised of the anc-chimps as the start node, H.erectus as the tar-
get node, and other potential species forming secondary nodes
in the graph. The edges are typically weighted; in this analysis,

 the weights are based on the inverse probability of transmission
(1 � P, where P is the probability of transmission).
If HSV2 was transmitted to H.erectus, no further cross-
species transmission event is needed to explain the infection of
modern humans. Simple vertical mother-to-child or horizontal
(sexual) transmission of the virus through the genus Homo from
this point would be sufficient as the ancestor-descendent path
from H.erectus to Homo sapiens is relatively secure (Maslin et al.
2015).
2.2.1 Bayesian inference
A Bayesian network or a belief network is a graphical structure
which allows us to represent and reason about an uncertain do-
main. In a Bayesian network, the species (nodes) are variables,
and the transmission paths (edges) represent direct links be-
tween species. The process of conditioning (also called probabil-
ity propagation or inference) is performed via a ‘flow of decisions’
through the network, which involves computing the posterior
probability distribution for a set of query nodes (hominins
which could have transmitted HSV2), given values for some
evidence (or observation) nodes (anc-chimps and H.erectus). The
presence of HSV2 in the common ancestors of modern humans,
and anc-chimps being the source species of the virus, provides
the evidence of the presence of HSV2 in anc-chimps and
H.erectus, and these species form the observation nodes in the
belief network. The process of conditioning involves computing
the probability of different nodes (hominins) for the acquisition
and transmission of HSV2 through all possible transmission
paths in the network, such that the observations of HSV2 in
anc-chimps (origin node) and H.erectus (target node) are true. An
important consideration in all Bayesian-based methods is the
choice of a prior. An empirical Bayesian method that estimates
the likelihood of HSV2 infection using a prior beta distribution
is adopted,
which
is an
approximation
to a
hierarchical
Bayesian
approach
(Murphy
2012; Farine
and Strandburg-
Peshkin 2015).
Bayesian networks provide full representations of probabil-
ity distributions over their variables, which allows us to infer
upon any subset of variables. A Bayesian network is created
using the DAG described earlier. Each node on the graph

 represents a potential intermediary host that has a probability
of transmitting HSV2. The probability of infection transmission
is represented as a beta distribution, with shape parameters al-
pha representing the time-period of the species in 100,000 years
and beta representing the distance to the neighbour in kilo-
metres. A conditional probability table (CPT) is generated for all
possible combinations of a dichotomous outcome for each vari-
able (thus HSV2 infection is true or false).
For example, to evaluate the CPT of node Paranthropus boisei,
we identified its parent nodes on the network graph as the
following species: anc-chimps, Australopithecus africanus, Homo
habilis, and H.rudolfensis. To calculate the probability of trans-
mission from anc-chimps to P.boisei, we assume a beta distribu-
tion. The parameter a represents the time-period overlap
between the two species, in this case 700 Kyr and b represents
the distance between the two species (35 kilometers between
the fossils of P.boisei and the extent of anc-chimps range). Based
on this beta distribution, Monte Carlo simulations are run to
sample from the distribution. This yields a probability of P.boisei
acquiring HSV2 from anc-chimps of 0.954. Similarly, the proba-
bility of other hominins infecting P.boisei are evaluated for
A.africanus, H.habilis, and H.rudolfensis as 0.096, 0.996, and 0.34,
respectively.
A

(Supplementary Table S4).
CPTs are evaluated for each node on the graph network. The
Bayesian inference analysis was performed on the network
using the Artificial Intelligence space decision network tool
(Poole
and
Mackworth
2010)
(http://aispace.org/bayes/).
The
‘Combined Inference’ approach is adopted to evaluate the probability
of intermediary hosts transmitting HSV2, by conditioning the anc-
chimp and H.erectus nodes for the presence of HSV2 (Korb and
Nicholson 2003), i.e. they are treated as being infected by HSV2.
2.2.2 Optimal path traversal
A* is an informed search algorithm that searches through all
possible paths to the target that yields the smallest cost
(Hart et al. 1968), which allows us to identify the most probable
HSV2 transmission path. This is done by combining information
by favouring vertices that are close to the starting point and to
the target. At each time-step, the A* algorithm selects the path
at a given vertex ‘n’ that has the lowest cost f(n) ¼ g(n) þ h(n),
where ‘g(n)’ represents the exact cost of the path from the start-
ing point to any vertex ‘n’, and ‘h(n)’ represents the heuristic es-
timated cost from vertex ‘n’ to the goal. A* balances the two as it
moves from the starting node to the target node. The most
probable transmission path is evaluated by minimising the tra-
versal costs based on the edge cost and nodal heuristics of the
transmission
network
graph.
A
Python
script
with
the
NetworkX package was used to implement the A* pathfinding
algorithm on the DAGs to identify the most probable (optimal)
HSV2
transmission
path (see https://gist.github.com/wadha
mite/e8991aff7d8d3a48d5bc846c747de6d8).
Two species, anc-chimps and H.erectus, formed the start
node and the target node of the DAG. The edges represent the
direction of HSV2 transmission and are weighted based on the
inverse probability of transmission between the species (nodes).
The weights (edge costs) are determined based on two probabil-
ity
models:

(HSV2-IP)

lighted in bold). The path remained unchanged in the sensitivity analysis.

 Transmission (HSV2-IT) based on the temporal and geographic
range of the species. More details about the probability models
are discussed in the next section. A CPT is used to determine
the nodal heuristics.
2.2.2.1 HSV2-IP model. The Infection Prevalence model is a local
model of probability, which assumes each transmission path
and species to be independent: the probability of a species being
infected by HSV2 is affected by how long the species persisted
and where the species was located, not the probability that other
species were infected.
The model uses a beta distribution to determine the proba-
bility of a species transmitting/being infected by HSV2 based on
the proximity of the species to the rainforest habitat and the du-
ration (difference between the first and the LAD) of the species.
Both the probability of transmission and infection are described
using beta distributions. The probability density function (PDF)
for a beta distribution is defined as:
PDF : xða�1Þð1 � xÞðb�1Þ
Bða; bÞ
where B a; b
ð
Þ ¼ C a
ð ÞC b
ð Þ
C a þ b
ð
Þ :
Where, C defines a gamma function, a is the time-period of
existence of the species in 100,000 years, and b is the distance
of the fossil from the rainforest in kilometers. The probability of
transmission through a particular path is determined as the
combined probability of the species (nodes) forming the edge.
For example, the probability of transmission path from anc-
chimps (P(A)) to P.boisei (P(B)) is the combined probability of both
these species (P(A*B)). The probability of transmission from anc-
chimps is evaluated using a beta distribution with a as 6,000
(corresponding to 6 million years of existence) and b as 100 (dis-
tance to the rainforest in km). The beta density functions of
HSV2 transmission/infection for anc-chimps and P.boisei are
shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. The probability of P.boisei being
infected also follows the same beta distribution with the param-
eters a as 700 (corresponding to 700,000 years of existence) and
b as 35 (distance to the rainforest in km). The edge costs were
estimated by Monte Carlo simulations of the combined proba-
bilities of two species (nodes), forming the edge, by sampling
from their respective beta distributions. A typical run of a
Monte
Carlo
simulation
is
shown
as
a
blue
line
in
Supplementary Fig. S2, where the probability of transmission by
anc-chimps (P(A) ¼ 0.97) and the probability of P.boisei being in-
fected (P(B) ¼ 0.9375), evaluates the combined probability of the
transmission path, for that run, as 0.909. Monte Carlo simula-
tion results are averaged over 1,000 simulation runs. Monte
Carlo simulations evaluating combined probabilities P(A*B) give
an edge cost of 0.937 for the edge (path) connecting anc-chimps
to P.boisei, i.e. the probability of HSV2 being transmitted from
anc-chimps to P.boisei is 0.937.
2.2.2.2 Stochastic modelling of infection transmission. Infection trans-
mission in epidemiology can be predicted using mathematical
models: a popular approach is the SIR model (Chen et al. 2008). In
the stochastic version of the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered)
model, the continuous variables are replaced by discrete numbers,
and the process rates are replaced by process probabilities. At time
‘t’ the probability that a new susceptible host is infected is mod-
elled as an exponential distribution, which is epidemiologically in-
correct for most diseases (Sartwell et al. 1950; Bailey 1975;
Wearing et al. 2005), i.e. the rate of leaving the exposed is
independent of the time spent on the host. Wearing et al. (2005)
suggested a more realistic distribution of latent and infectious pe-
riods, with a stronger central tendency:
Number of
infectives
at time ðtÞ
¼
Initial number of infectives who are
still infectious at time ðtÞþ
Those who have acquired the infection
in the time interval ½0; t� and are
still infectious at time ðtÞ:
More realistic distributions can be obtained by choosing a
PDF of the infectious period, p(t) to be a gamma PDF (Blythe and
Anderson 1988).
2.2.2.3 HSV2-IT model. The proposed Infection Transmission
model considers the history of transmission, and the probability
of paths (edges) and species (nodes) are dependent on the par-
ent nodes and paths. The probability of a parent node being in-
fected with HSV2 affects the probability of a child node being
infected with HSV2 in addition to the proximity and time-period
overlap between the parent and child nodes.
The model utilises the temporal overlap between hominin
species and their geographic proximity to one another to deter-
mine the probability of a transmission path, using a gamma dis-
tribution. The PDF of a gamma distribution is given as:
PDF :
ba
CðaÞ xa�1e�bx
in terms of shape a and rate b. The shape parameter a is defined
as the ratio of the time-period in 1,000 years/distance in kilo-
metres and the rate parameter b is defined as the normalised
time-period ‘Y/x’, where ‘x’ is the time-period of the species in
1,000 years and ‘Y’ is the time-period of anc-chimps. The proba-
bility density distribution of transmission of HSV2 from anc-
chimps is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. Monte Carlo simula-
tions were performed to evaluate the conditional probability of
transmission between species, as mutually exclusive events,
considering the parent nodes by sampling from the respective
probability distributions.
For example, the probability of P.boisei transmitting HSV2 to
H.erectus depends on the probabilities of P.boisei being infected
by the anc-chimps and/or H.habilis and/or H.rudolfensis. The proba-
bility of transmission follows the gamma distribution. The gamma
distribution for anc-chimp is defined with a shape parameter a
of 6, and a rate parameter b of 10. Similarly, the gamma probability
distribution is evaluated for other parent nodes of P.boisei (i.e.
H.habilis and/or H.rudolfensis) based on their time-period overlap
and distance. The path from A.afarensis is ignored in this analysis
due to its low probability of transmitting HSV2. A conditional
probability of transmitting HSV2 from P.boisei to H.erectus, given
the probability distributions of all possible paths capable of infect-
ing P.boisei that is P(C j A U B U C), is evaluated as 0.152.
2.3 Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the impact of the
probability distribution models in estimating the edge costs and
in turn the optimal path of transmission. A variance-based
global sensitivity analysis was performed using the Saltelli
method, a variation of the Sobol technique, to evaluate the sen-
sitivity indices of the transmission model (Sobol0 2001; Saltelli

 et al. 2010). The sensitivity of each input is represented by a nu-
meric value called the sensitivity index. These indices are used
to estimate the influence of individual variables or groups of
variables on the model output, by decomposing the variance of
the model output into fractions. Although spatial and temporal
range is often presented as a hard number in biology the
complexities found on the ground are much more nuanced both
in terms of daily interactions and evolutionary trajectories
(Benton and Hitchin 1996). These complexities are, naturally,
further compounded when dealing with a fragmentary fossil
record. To allow for natural uncertainty to be introduced
into the models the level of variation for sensitivity analysis
was set at 10 per cent to mirror diffusion between temporal
and spatial borders. A parametric space of edge costs was gen-
erated for the Sobol analysis by sampling 50,000 times from
the probabilistic distribution for each edge. This generated a to-
tal of 2.3 million analyses for the sensitivity analysis for each
transmission model. The first-, second-, and the total-order in-
dices were measured using a Python script with the SALib
package.
3. Results
The results from the Bayesian inference and the optimal
path traversal using the Infection Prevalence and Infection
Transmission models are presented later, beginning with the
Bayesian inference analysis, the optimal path traversal results
and finally the sensitivity analysis of the different models.
3.1 Bayesian inference
By conditioning anc-chimps and H.erectus for the presence of
HSV2, the combined Bayesian inference of the DAG reveals
A.afarensis (90%), H.habilis (67.8%), P.boisei (50%), and H.rudolfensis
(55.8%) to be the likely intermediary hosts for the transmission of
HSV2. These are the most probable hosts to have acquired HSV2,
and a transmission path through these hosts is more likely.
3.2 Optimal path traversal
The optimal traversal path of the DAG for HSV2 transmission
was modelled using the Infection Prevalence and the Infection
Transmission models. The A* algorithm using the weighted
DAGs from both models identified P.boisei as the most probable
intermediary hosts that transmitted HSV2 from anc-chimps to
the ancestors of modern humans (Fig. 2). In addition to the di-
rect transmission of HSV2 from anc-chimps to P.boisei, the
Infection Transmission model also identified H.habilis as an in-
termediary host that transmitted HSV2 to P.boisei, which subse-
quently transmitted to the ancestors of modern humans (Fig. 3).
Table 1 shows the probable HSV2 intermediary paths and their
rankings based on the edge weights from the probabilistic
models.
3.3 Sensitivity analysis
We performed sensitivity analysis allowing the input parame-
ters of the probabilistic distributions for both the models to vary
Figure 3. The A* shortest path for the Infection Transmission model. The lines with arrows are the possible transmission paths. The values on the lines are the edge
costs (inverse probability of transmission). This model predicts that the host-switch of HSV2 occurred through the primary path of anc-chimps -> H.habilis -> P.boisei ->
H.erectus (shown in bold). Sensitivity analysis revealed the primary path occurred in 60 per cent of cases, as opposed to the secondary path of anc-chimps -> P.boisei
-> H.erectus (which occurred the remaining 40% of cases, shown as dotted lines) when time-period overlaps and distance were varied by 6 10 per cent.

 by 10 per cent. A total of 2.3 million analyses were performed
for each model by sampling 50,000 times from the respective
probability distributions for each edge. The cost of transmission
of HSV2 along all possible paths (path costs) from anc-chimps
to H.erectus were calculated. The path cost represents the ease
of transmitting HSV2 through the path. A path cost is calculated
as an arithmetic sum of the inverse probability of transmission
through each edge in a given transmission path. The most prob-
able transmission path is always the one that has the lowest
cost (i.e. the sum of the probabilities of all of the edges in the
path is the highest).
3.3.1 HSV2-IP model
The input parameters to this model were distance to the rain-
forest and the overlap in the time-period, allowed to vary by
10 per cent. Sensitivity analysis of HSV2-IP model always
predicted the transmission path as ‘anc-chimps -> P.boisei ->
H.erectus’. The path costs show a uniform distribution be-
tween 0.526 and 0.649, with an average path cost of 0.587
(Supplementary Fig. S5). The total- and first-order Sobol indi-
ces of the ‘anc-chimp -> P.boisei’ path is 4.53E-2 and 4.53E-2,
respectively. The ‘P.boisei -> H.erectus’ path has a total index
of 9.55E-1 and a first-order index of 9.55E-1. All other paths
had negligible or zero index values. The frequency of occur-
rence of different transmission paths from the sensitivity
analyses are summarised in Supplementary Table S5. When
the critical path, defined as the path that costs the least to
traverse, through P.boisei is not available, the transmission
path from anc-chimps to H.erectus was through H.habilis (nor-
malised path costs, defined as the ratio of the path cost to the
critical path cost in the graph, 1.08–1.32 of the critical path
cost) for 67 per cent of the cases and through H.rudolfensis
(normalised path costs of 1.11–1.32 of the critical path cost)
for the remaining 33 per cent.
3.3.2 HSV2-IT model
In this analysis, the input parameters of the gamma distribution
were the proximity of species and the time-period overlap be-
tween species, varied by 10 per cent. The distribution of individ-
ual path costs used to populate the edge costs of the DAG used
in the sensitivity analysis are shown in Fig. 4. Sensitivity analy-
sis predicted a primary transmission path (60% of the cases) of
anc-chimps -> H.habilis -> P.boisei -> H.erectus and a secondary
transmission path (remaining 40%) through anc-chimps ->
P.boisei -> H.erectus. The distribution of the shortest path costs
for both the primary and secondary transmission paths are
shown in Fig. 5. The Sobol indices for the HSV2-IT model are
presented in Table 2.
4. Discussion
4.1 Transmission of HSV2
The combined inference analysis of a Bayesian Network, con-
sidering the presence of HSV2 in both anc-chimps and H.erectus,
revealed A.afarensis (90%), H.habilis (67.8%), P.boisei (50%), and
H.rudolfensis
(55.8%)
to
be
the
likely
intermediary
hosts.
Although A.afarensis had a close proximity to the geographical
range of anc-chimps, the only hominin it could transmit HSV2
to was A.africanus, and A.africanus has a mere 3 per cent chance
of being infected by HSV2 due its geographic location. This lim-
its the possibility of HSV2 transmission to H.habilis, P.boisei, and
H.rudolfensis either directly or as intermediary hosts.
The HSV2-IP is a local model that describes the probability of
HSV2 infection based on the proximity to the rainforest habitat
and the duration a species persisted in the fossil record using a
beta distribution. In a beta distribution, the parameters a (time-
period) and b (proximity to the rainforest) are weighted equally,
i.e. an increase in the distance to the rainforest by 1 km has the
same effect on probability as a decrease of 1,000 years in the
time-period. Thus the beta distribution assumes a constant rate
of infection transmission. The HSV2-IP model considers each
transmission as an independent event, i.e. the probability of a
species transmitting HSV2 is independent of previous events
leading to the HSV2 infection of that species.
The A* algorithm using the weighted DAG with the HSV2-IP
model predicted the transmission of HSV2 from anc-chimps to
H.erectus through P.boisei with an average path cost of 0.587.
Sensitivity analysis did not show any variation in the path
(i.e. varying the location and the time-period of the probable
species by 10 per cent did not affect the optimal path). Non-zero
values of sensitivity indices were observed only along the criti-
cal transmission path of ‘anc-chimp -> P.boisei -> H.erectus’.
Although, the ‘P.boisei -> H.erectus’ path accounted for 95.5 per
cent variation in the path costs, the path cost of ‘anc-chimp ->
P.boisei’ was the critical value that controlled the transmission
path. Hence, the optimal path through P.boisei remained unaf-
fected. Further analysis of the path revealed a significant influ-
ence (88–90% of the variation in the results) of P.boisei (its
proximity and duration) on the path cost in contrast to the ef-
fect of proximity and duration of anc-chimps and H.erectus on
the path costs. The infection prevalence model uses a beta dis-
tribution, which assumes equal weights for the shape parame-
ters: alpha and beta. As expected, Sobol analysis showed equal
influence for the distance and time-period parameters (a first-
order Sobol indices of 0.493 and 0.492, respectively) on the path
costs. Due to the nature of beta distribution, care should be
taken in defining the rate of transmission (ratio of the shape pa-
rameters, alpha and beta), as the probability value estimated
from the distribution is dependent on the ratio of the shape

 parameters. The intermediary host identified as P.boisei is only
35 kilometers from the rainforest, which results in high proba-
bility of transmission, and hence results in the lowest cost of
transmission through this species. HSV2-IP is a local model,
which is independent of other events and does not consider the
history of transmission and the associated probabilities.
The HSV2-IT model assigns probability values (edge costs) to
the DAG utilising the temporal overlap between hominin spe-
cies and their geographic proximity to one another. The HSV2-
IT model is history dependent, i.e. the probability of a child
node transmitting a disease depends on the probability of the
parent nodes infecting the child node in a DAG. The Infection
Transmission model predicts an initial transmission of HSV2
from anc-chimps to H.habilis. Further, H.habilis transmitted the
virus to P.boisei, which then infected H.erectus. The average
shortest path cost was estimated as 1.05. Sensitivity analysis of
the HSV2-IT model revealed two transmission paths: (1) pri-
mary transmission path (60% of the cases) of ‘anc-chimps
-> H.habilis -> P.boisei -> H.erectus’ and (2) a secondary transmis-
sion path (remaining 40% of the cases) through ‘anc-chimps
-> P.boisei -> H.erectus’. However, the distribution of path costs
through both the paths were similar, showing that both

Sensitivity
analysis shows that the ‘anc-chimp -> H.habilis’ and ‘anc-chimp
-> P.boisei’ have quite a significant effect on the transmission
path (total path cost). About 70 per cent the variation in the
path of ‘anc-chimp -> H.habilis’ is due to the direct effect of edge
weight determined by the gamma distribution in comparison to

path.
Secondary interactions (interactions between different paths)
accounts for 30–35 per cent of the overall routing. The probabil-
ity of a species transmitting, and another being infected had
similar effects (similar Sobol indices), which explains that the
model did not have a bias either towards the proximity or the
temporal overlap between species. Because the HSV2-IT model
considers the history of transmission, it is a better predictor
than the HSV2-IP model.
Our analysis suggests that P.boisei was the most critical in-
termediate host for transmitting HSV2 between anc-chimps
and the ancestors of H.sapiens. The transmission of HSV2 from
anc-chimps to P.boisei could have happened directly or through
H.habilis. However, our analysis did not predict H.habilis trans-
mitting HSV2 directly to H.erectus. Our results suggest the initial
transmission to P.boisei could have happened from H.habilis
60 per cent of the time (most likely through direct sexual con-
tact rather than consumption of infected tissue) and the re-
maining 40 per cent was directly transmitted from anc-chimps
via hunting or scavenging.

 and consumption of raw meat would act as a simple path for
ChHV1 to have crossed into P.boisei via open cuts or sores.
Tropical refugia during hot dry periods may have driven chim-
panzees into higher concentrations in certain areas, driving
them into contact and competition with P.boisei and H.habilis as
the margins of tropical forest blended into more open savan-
nah-like habitats (Julier et al. 2017). Violent confrontation or
hunting/scavenging and butchery practices would have pro-
vided a viable path of transmission for HSV2. Homo habilis re-
mains have been recovered from the same layers as stone tools
and bones carrying evidence of butchery, supporting a possible
transmission–through-hunting/scavenging hypothesis for the
initial
anc-chimp
to
H.habilis
transmission
(Clarke
2012).
Paranthropus aethiopicus, P.boisei, and P.robustus are associated
with the Oldowan stone tool complex (De Heinzelin et al. 1999),
and P.boisei explicitly with butchery (Domı
´nguez-Rodrigo et al.
2013) lending support to the hypothesis that bushmeat hunting/
scavenging and butchery may have led to the initial transmis-
sion of HSV2 to the hominins.
Both H.erectus and P.boisei are known from sites around Lake
Turkana in Kenya that are contiguous in age (Wood and
Constantino 2007; Anton et al. 2016) and it is likely that close
contact between the species would have been relatively com-
mon especially around water sources. The appearance of
H.erectus 2.0 MYA is accompanied by evidence of active hunting
and butchery, and from 1.76 MYA increasingly sophisticated
stone tools (Cachel and Harris 1998). This behavioural shift to-
wards active hunting displayed by H.erectus, combined with di-
rect archaeological evidence of hunting, provides a credible
path for direct transmission of HSV2 from P.boisei to H.erectus
through contact and/or consumption of infected material pro-
cessed from P.boisei carcasses.
In this study, H.erectus is chosen as the target node for the
transmission of HSV2 for a number of reasons. Morphological
adaptation for bipedal locomotion is used as the primary trait
for assigning fossils to the hominin sub-family, especially be-
tween 7.0 and 4.5 MYA, but is not an effective tool for determin-
ing patterns of ancestor-descendant relationships in the fossil
record. The hominin sub-family currently contains seven gen-
era but the exact taxonomic relationship between each genus is
not clearly definable because of the fragmentary nature of the
fossil record. Similarly, patterns of intra- and inter-species vari-
ation are difficult to define (Foley 2016). The adaptive radiation
of the genus Australopithecus between 4.5 and 2.0 MYA repre-
sents the first morphologically coherent group of fossil hominin
species but its relationship to the genus Homo is not yet clear.
The appearance of H.erectus circa 2.0 MYA in East Africa marks
the first appearance of recognisably ‘human’ morphology, life
history and brain development and represents a secure most re-
cent common ancestor for all subsequent Homo species (with
the possible exception of Homo floresiensis (Anton et al. 2016;
Argue et al. 2017)). Therefore, the ancestor-descendant relation-
ship between H.erectus at c. 2.0 MYA and H.sapiens c. 200 KYA is
an evolutionarily secure path of transmission for HSV2 to leave
Africa as a modern human-borne virus.
Although ChHV1 causes outbreaks of oral and pharyngeal le-
sions in chimpanzees in a manner similar to HSV1, in hominins
contracting HSV2, the oral niche was already occupied by HSV1.
This may have protected the hominin first infected with HSV2:
pre-existing infection with HSV1 reduces the likelihood that
subsequent
infection
with
HSV2
will
be
symptomatic
(Langenberg et al. 1999), and also reduces the risk of HSV2 men-
ingitis (Aurelius et al. 2012). HSV2 may have been forced to
adapt to a different mucosal niche to reduce competition from
the co-evolved, native HSV1. However, both simplexviruses re-
main capable of infecting both the oral and genital niche in
modern humans (Kim et al. 2006; Whitley et al. 2007), and of
causing co-infection in both niches (e.g. 10–15% of herpes labia-
lis (oral lesions) is caused by HSV2 (Glick and Siegel 1999)).
We suggest that the mode of transmission of HSV2 to homi-
nins was most likely through hunting injuries (e.g. chimpanzee
bites or cuts sustained during meat processing), although on-
wards transmission into the ancestors of H.sapiens could have
been sexual (horizontal) or a result of hunting injuries (vertical).
There are reports of transmission of B virus (Cercopithecine her-
pesvirus 1), the cercopith homolog of HSV1 and ChHV1, to hu-
mans, where disease ranges from mild to fatal. Transmission
has occurred from bites and scratches, needle sticks and even
scratches from cage bars that are contaminated with B virus-
positive bodily fluids (Huff and Barry 2003). Onwards transmis-
sion between humans has been reported to occur (Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) 1987). HSV1 can infect other primates,
from gorillas (Gilardi et al. 2014) to owl monkeys (Melendez
et al. 1969), typically causing fatal disease in species more dis-
tantly related to H.sapiens, while causing oral lesions and milder
disease in great apes such as Gorilla beringei graueri (Gilardi et al.
2014). We therefore infer that herpes simplex-like viruses
spread relatively easily between individuals even across species
barriers, increasing the chances of transmission between homi-
nins and other primates from close contact such as hunting,
butchery, inter-personal violence, or sexual contact. Evidence
for close hominin–hominid contact is also found in other ‘heir-
loom’ human pathogens (Houldcroft and Underdown 2016;
Houldcroft et al. 2017).
The high prevalence of HSV2 in central and eastern Africa
(Looker et al. 2015) (Supplementary Fig. S1 and interactive maps
at https://wadhamite.github.io/hsv2-map) is consistent with
the limited genetic data available from African HSV2 isolates.
A study from (Burrel et al. 2015) showed that HSV2 can be di-
vided into African and worldwide lineages on the basis of diver-
sity in gene UL30. Furthermore, two groups found evidence of
gene flow from HSV1 into HSV2, and speculated that the flow of
HSV1 loci into the worldwide HSV2 lineage may have helped
this lineage of HSV2 to further adapt to human hosts, and so
spread more successfully around the world from around 41 KYA
(Burrel et al. 2017; Koelle et al. 2017). Recent studies have signifi-
cantly increased the number of whole HSV2 genomes available
for analysis, contributing to our knowledge of HSV2 diversity
(Szpara et al. 2014; Kolb et al. 2015); but there is conflicting evi-
dence on whether the most basal HSV2 genotypes are from
west and central (Burrel et al. 2017) or east (Koelle et al. 2017)
Africa. Our analyses predict that individuals from east Africa
are likely to carry the most ancient HSV2 lineages.
The time-depth of ancient DNA analysis is dually limited by
technology and preservation of DNA. Similarly, the archaeologi-
cal and fossil records suffer from differential rates of preserva-
tion (Allentoft et al. 2012; Kistler et al. 2017) and gaps that can
never be filled because the material has simply not survived.
Our analysis has allowed the reconstruction of hominin/
human-disease interaction well beyond the horizon of ancient
DNA and at a level that is invisible to the fossil and archaeologi-
cal records. There are other ancient human pathogens that
have switched between different primate and hominin hosts
over the last 6 million years and these transmission paths could
be further explored with this methodology. For example, human
pubic lice (Pthirus pubis) were introduced by an unknown homi-
nin through contact with the ancestor of gorillas around 3.3
MYA (Reed et al. 2007). There is also evidence of Neanderthal to
