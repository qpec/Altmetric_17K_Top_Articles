IMPORTANCE The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria set a goal
of reducing inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020, but the extent of
inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the rates of outpatient oral antibiotic prescribing by age and
diagnosis, and the estimated portions of antibiotic use that may be inappropriate in adults
and children in the United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using the 2010-2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care
Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, annual numbers and
population-adjusted rates with 95% confidence intervals of ambulatory visits with oral
antibiotic prescriptions by age, region, and diagnosis in the United States were estimated.
EXPOSURES Ambulatory care visits.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Based on national guidelines and regional variation in
prescribing, diagnosis-specific prevalence and rates of total and appropriate antibiotic
prescriptions were determined. These rates were combined to calculate an estimate of the
appropriate annual rate of antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 population.
RESULTS Of the 184 032 sampled visits, 12.6% of visits (95% CI, 12.0%-13.3%) resulted in
antibiotic prescriptions. Sinusitis was the single diagnosis associated with the most antibiotic
prescriptions per 1000 population (56 antibiotic prescriptions [95% CI, 48-64]), followed by
suppurative otitis media (47 antibiotic prescriptions [95% CI, 41-54]), and pharyngitis
(43 antibiotic prescriptions [95% CI, 38-49]). Collectively, acute respiratory conditions per
1000 population led to 221 antibiotic prescriptions (95% CI, 198-245) annually, but only 111
antibiotic prescriptions were estimated to be appropriate for these conditions. Per 1000
population, among all conditions and ages combined in 2010-2011, an estimated 506
antibiotic prescriptions (95% CI, 458-554) were written annually, and, of these, 353 antibiotic
prescriptions were estimated to be appropriate antibiotic prescriptions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In the United States in 2010-2011, there was an estimated
annual antibiotic prescription rate per 1000 population of 506, but only an estimated 353
antibiotic prescriptions were likely appropriate, supporting the need for establishing a goal
for outpatient antibiotic stewardship.

A
ntibiotic-resistant infections affect 2 million people
and are associated with 23 000 deaths annually in the
United States, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC).1 Antibiotic use is the primary
driver of antibiotic resistance1 and leads to adverse events
ranging from allergic reactions to Clostridium difficile
infections.2 Data from other developed nations suggest that
80% or more of antibiotic use (excluding agricultural use)
occurs among outpatients.3 In the United States in 2011,
262 million outpatient antibiotic prescriptions were
dispensed.4 Declining trends in antibiotic prescribing in the
United States occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s but sta-
bilized by 2010.5,6
Reducing inappropriate use is essential to reduce both an-
tibiotic resistance and adverse events. National guidelines ad-
dressing when to prescribe antibiotics have been published
over the last 2 decades for many common diagnoses.7-10 The
CDC’
s Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work program fo-
cuses on promoting appropriate outpatient antibiotic use.11 In
March2015,theWhiteHousereleasedtheNationalActionPlan
for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, which set a tar-
get of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in the outpatient
setting by 50% by 2020.12 However, the fraction of antibiotic
use that is inappropriate and amenable to reduction is
unknown.13 Previous goals and national measures of appro-
priate antibiotic use (eg, Healthy People 2020 targets and
Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set [HEDIS]
measures)havetargetedspecificagegroupsandconditions(eg,
ear infections or acute bronchitis).14,15 To our knowledge, there
is no current overall estimate of appropriate outpatient anti-
biotic prescribing that considers all ages and conditions that
may receive antibiotics. The objectives of this study were to
establish a baseline of the current rate of outpatient, oral an-
tibiotic prescriptions by age and diagnosis and to estimate the
overall rate of appropriate, outpatient antibiotic prescrip-
tions in the United States to inform public health and antibi-
otic stewardship efforts.
Methods
Data Sources
Baseline antibiotic prescribing rates were estimated using the
National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and
National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
(NHAMCS). These cross-sectional surveys are administered
annually by the CDC’
s National Center for Health Statistics.16
NAMCS samples visits to nonfederally-employed, office-
based physicians primarily engaged in patient care and
selects visits using a 3-stage probability sampling design.
NAMCS samples geographic regions, physicians, and visits
during randomly assigned 1-week reporting periods.
NHAMCS is a survey of emergency departments and outpa-
tient departments of nonfederal general and short-stay
hospitals.16 NHAMCS uses a 4-stage probability sampling
design. NHAMCS samples geographic regions, hospitals, out-
patient department clinics, and emergency service areas, and
visits during 4-week reporting periods. Data collected include
patient demographics, up to 3 diagnoses that are coded by
NAMCS/NHAMCS staff using the International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM),
and up to 8 medications mentioned—meaning prescribed,
continued, or provided at the visit.
Sampled visits in both surveys are distributed randomly
throughout the year. Weights are assigned to visits so national
estimates can be produced. The most recent 2 years of data
available in both NAMCS and NHAMCS (2010-2011) were used.
Unweightedresponseratesduring2010-2011rangedfrom54.1%
to 58.3% for physicians in NAMCS, 66.7% to 73.6% for outpa-
tient departments, and 80.4% to 87.5% for emergency depart-
ments in NHAMCS. Estimates from NAMCS are adjusted for
physician and item nonresponse. Estimates from NHAMCS are
adjusted for hospital nonresponse and for nonresponse at the
level of the emergency departments and outpatient depart-
ments. The National Center for Health Statistics research eth-
ics review board approved NAMCS/NHAMCS, with waivers of
informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Ac-
countabilityActauthorizationforpatients.Theseanalyseswere
based on publically available, deidentified data, and there-
fore were not subject to institutional review board require-
ments as determined in consultation with the human sub-
jectsadvisorfortheNationalCenterforEmergingandZoonotic
Infectious Disease.
All visits during 2010-2011 were included unless result-
ing in hospital or observation unit admission or if parenteral
antibiotics were mentioned without oral antibiotics (0.4% of
visits). National estimates were produced from 184 032 un-
weighted visits in 2010-2011. Antibiotics were coded in terms
oftheirgenericcomponentsandtherapeuticclassesusingLexi-
con Plus (Cerner Multum).16 Data were not available on route
of administration. Antibiotics supplied only in topical formu-
lations were excluded. Oral antibiotics were defined as anti-
biotics with oral formulations, and parenteral antibiotics were
defined as those antibiotics not available in oral formulations
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). As outpatient, oral antibiotics are
only available via prescription, medication mentions of anti-
biotics were assumed to be prescriptions, similar to previous
studies.17-19
Establishing the Baseline
The mean annual rates per 1000 population of visits with an-
tibiotic prescriptions by age group (0-2, 3-9, 10-19, 20-39, 40-
64, ≥65 years) and US Census region (Northeast, South, Mid-
west, and West) for 2010-2011 were calculated. The Northeast
region included Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachu-
setts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and
Pennsylvania. The Midwest region included Ohio, Michigan,
Indiana,Illinois,Wisconsin,Missouri,Iowa,Minnesota,Kansas,
Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota. The South region
included Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia,
WestVirginia,NorthCarolina,SouthCarolina,Florida,Georgia,
Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,
Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. The West region included
Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah,
Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, California, Alaska, and
Hawaii. The mean annual rate per 1000 population, number,

and percentage of visits with antibiotics prescribed were also
calculated by diagnosis and age group. For diagnosis-based
analyses, larger age groups (0-19, 20-64, ≥65 years) were used
to produce more reliable estimates.
Diagnostic categories for common outpatient infections
(eTable 2 in the Supplement) were established and visits were
classified into these categories. As NAMCS/NHAMCS do not
contain links between diagnoses and medication mentions,
visit diagnoses were classified based on the most likely indi-
cation for an antibiotic prescription in a tiered fashion. Tier 1
diagnoses were diagnoses for which antibiotics are almost al-
ways indicated: pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), or
miscellaneous bacterial infections (eg, pertussis and syphi-
lis). Tier 2 diagnoses are diagnoses for which antibiotics may
be indicated: sinusitis; suppurative otitis media; skin, cuta-
neous, and mucosal infections; pharyngitis; gastrointestinal
infections; and acne. Tier 3 diagnoses were all other diagnos-
tic categories for which antibiotics are not indicated or the in-
dication was unclear. In assigning each visit a single diagno-
sis, priority was given to tier 1 diagnoses, then tier 2 diagnoses,
then tier 3 diagnoses. If a visit had multiple diagnoses from a
single tier, the first-listed diagnosis was assigned.
Estimating Appropriate Antibiotic Prescribing
To estimate appropriate oral antibiotic prescribing in ambula-
tory care, the Pew Charitable Trusts convened a group of
experts on outpatient antibiotic use to determine methods
for estimating the fraction of antibiotic use that is appropri-
ate. Each author reviewed available national guidelines from
professional societies for common conditions (eTable 3 in the
Supplement). Estimated levels of appropriate antibiotic pre-
scribing by age group were based on national guidelines for
diagnoses for which national guidelines could be used to rec-
ommend specific antibiotic prescribing rates: pharyngitis;
asthma, allergy; bronchitis, bronchiolitis; influenza; nonsup-
purative otitis media; viral upper respiratory tract infection;
viral and nonviral pneumonia; UTI; and miscellaneous bacte-
rial infections (eg, pertussis and syphilis). Regional variability
was used to produce estimates of appropriate antibiotic pre-
scriptions for diagnoses for which guidelines could not be
used to recommend specific antibiotic prescribing rates:
sinusitis, suppurative otitis media, and the remaining other
conditions. Regional analyses of antibiotic prescribing by age
group were conducted to identify regions with the lowest
regional antibiotic prescription rates, recognizing there is evi-
dence of antibiotic overuse even in the lowest-prescribing
regions.20 Estimates were combined using national guide-
lines and regional variability to calculate an overall estimate
of appropriate antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 population.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 12 (STATA
Corp) and accounted for the components of the complex sur-
vey design including patient visit weights, strata, and pri-
mary sampling unit design variables. Two years of survey data
were combined for analyses to increase sample size by age and
diagnosis. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals were cal-
culatedforallestimates.Antibioticprescribingrateswerecom-
pared using χ2 test for heterogeneity. Estimates were not cal-
culatedifbasedonfewerthan30sampledvisitsoriftherelative
standard error was less than 0.3, as such estimates do not meet
standards of reliability or precision.16 Significance was con-
sidered at 2-sided P value less than .05. Population denomi-
nators were based on the July 1, 2010, and July 1, 2011, set of
estimates of the civilian, noninstitutional population of the
UnitedStates,asdevelopedbythePopulationDivision,USCen-
sus Bureau.21 Additionally, a post hoc sensitivity analysis was
performed using the lowest-prescribing region as the bench-
mark for all estimates of appropriate antibiotic prescribing for
diagnoses targeted for reduction.
Results
In 2010-2011, of the 184 032 sampled ambulatory care visits,
12.6% (95% CI, 12.0%-13.3%) were associated with antibiotic
prescriptions (Table 1), with an estimated 506 antibiotic pre-
scriptions (95% CI, 458-554) per 1000 US population annually
(Table 2). Per 1000 population, antibiotic prescribing rates
ranged from 423 antibiotic prescriptions (95% CI, 343-504) in
the West to 553 antibiotic prescriptions (95% CI, 459-648) in
the South (Table 3). The annual antibiotic prescription rate was
highest among children aged 0 through 2 years at 1287 antibi-
otic prescriptions (95% CI, 1085-1489) per 1000 population.
The top 3 diagnoses associated with antibiotic prescrip-
tions per 1000 population were sinusitis (56 antibiotic pre-
scriptions [95% CI, 48-64] ), suppurative otitis media
(47 antibiotic prescriptions [95% CI, 41-54]), and pharyngitis
(43 antibiotic prescriptions [95% CI, 38-49]) (Table 2). Collec-
tively, acute respiratory conditions, defined as sinusitis, sup-
purative otitis media, nonsuppurative otitis media, pharyngi-
tis, viral upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis and
bronchiolitis, asthma and allergy, influenza and viral and
nonviral pneumonia, were associated with an estimated 221
antibiotic prescriptions (95% CI, 198-245) per 1000 popula-
tion annually.
For pharyngitis, national guidelines recommend antibi-
otic therapy only for streptococcal pharyngitis.7 Based on re-
cent literature, 37% of children presenting for medical visits
with sore throat tested positive for group A Streptococcus.22,23
However, 56.2% of visits (95% CI, 49.8%-62.4%) by children
with pharyngitis were associated with antibiotic prescribing
in 2010-2011 (Table 1). For adults presenting for medical vis-
its with sore throat, about 18% have streptococcal pharyngi-
tis (ie, meet clinical criteria and have a positive test result for
group A Streptococcus),7,23 but 72.4% (95% CI, 66.8%-77.4%)
of visits by adults aged 20 through 64 years with pharyngitis
were associated with antibiotic prescribing.
National guidelines state that patients with bronchitis
(excluding visits with diagnoses of chronic bronchitis,
emphysema, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease),24,25
bronchiolitis,26 viral upper respiratory tract infections,25,27
asthma and allergy,28 influenza,29 viral pneumonia30 and
nonsuppurative otitis media31 should not receive antibiotics,
and thus antibiotics for these conditions were considered
inappropriate.

Sinusitis and suppurative otitis media sometimes war-
rantantibiotics;however,theappropriaterateofantibioticpre-
scriptions for these conditions is uncertain. Thus, the lowest
regional rate of visits with antibiotic prescriptions was se-
lected as the estimate of the appropriate rate (eTable 4 in the
Supplement). For sinusitis, the estimated appropriate antibi-
otic prescription rates per 1000 participants by age group were
as follows: 59 (95% CI, 32-86) for 0 through 19 years, 27 (95%
CI, 17-36) for 20 through 64 years, and 37 (95% CI, 16-59) for
65 years and older. For suppurative otitis media, the esti-
mated appropriate antibiotic prescription rates per 1000 par-
ticipants by age group were as follows: 138 (95% CI, 96-179)
for 0 through 19 years and 6 (95% CI, 4-9) for 20 through 64

or older with suppurative otitis media due to the small num-
ber of sampled visits.
Antibiotic prescription rates were considered appropri-
ate for pneumonia because the diagnosis almost always war-
rants antibiotic therapy.30
For other conditions, excluding acute respiratory condi-
tions listed above, antibiotic prescriptions were considered
appropriate for UTI and miscellaneous bacterial infections
(eg, pertussis and syphilis), as these conditions almost
always warrant antibiotic therapy.32 For the remaining
other conditions (excluding acute respiratory conditions,
UTIs, and miscellaneous bacterial infections), the lowest
regional rate of visits with antibiotic prescriptions per 1000
participants by age group was selected as the estimated
appropriate rate (eTable 4 in the Supplement): 137 (95% CI,
100-174) for 0 through 19 years, 180 (95% CI, 140-220) for

a Diagnostic categories were created based on the most likely indication for an
antibiotic prescription in a tiered fashion. Tier 1 diagnoses were those in which
antibiotics are almost always indicated: pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or
miscellaneous bacterial infections (eg, pertussis and syphilis). Tier 2 diagnoses
are those for which antibiotics may be indicated: sinusitis, suppurative otitis
media; skin, cutaneous, and mucosal infections, pharyngitis, gastrointestinal
infections, and acne. Tier 3 diagnoses were all other diagnostic categories for
which antibiotics are not indicated. In assigning each visit a single diagnosis,
priority was given to tier 1 diagnoses, then tier 2 diagnoses, then tier 3
diagnoses. See eTable 2 in the Supplement for full details and included
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
codes for diagnostic categories.

The actual and estimated appropriate antibi-
otic prescription rates by age group for each con-
dition and overall are shown in Table 4. The esti-
mated annual appropriate antibiotic prescription
rate for acute respiratory conditions per 1000
population was 111 antibiotic prescriptions for all
ages vs 221 antibiotic prescriptions (95% CI, 198-
245) annually for acute respiratory conditions in
2010-2011, a 50% reduction from the point esti-
mate of the 2010-2011 annual rate. The esti-
mated annual appropriate rate per 1000 popula-
tion for other conditions (excluding acute
respiratory) was 242 antibiotic prescriptions vs
284(95%CI,256-313)annuallyin2010-2011,a15%
reduction from the point estimate of the 2010-
2011 annual rate. When all conditions were com-
bined, the estimated appropriate annual antibi-
otic prescription rate for all conditions in all ages
in the United States per 1000 population was 353
vs 506 (95% CI, 458-554) annually in 2010-2011,
a 30% reduction from the point estimate of the
2010-2011 annual rate. The results of the sensi-
tivity analysis using the lowest-prescribing re-
gion as the estimate of appropriate antibiotic pre-
scribing for all diagnoses identified for reduction
are shown in eTable 5 in the Supplement.
Discussion
These analyses describe antibiotic prescribing
practices during ambulatory care visits in the
United States by age group and diagnosis in 2010-
2011, with an overall estimated annual rate of 506
antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 US population.
In the United States, an estimated 154 million pre-
scriptions for antibiotics were written in ambula-
tory care settings annually during 2010-2011. Half
of antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory
conditions may have been unnecessary, repre-
senting 34 million antibiotic prescriptions annu-
ally. Collectively, across all conditions, an esti-
mated 30% of outpatient, oral antibiotic
prescriptionsmayhavebeeninappropriate.There-
fore, a 15% reduction in overall antibiotic use
would be necessary to meet the White House Na-
tional Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-
Resistant Bacteria goal of reducing inappropriate
antibiotic use in the outpatient setting by 50% by
2020.12 This estimate of inappropriate outpa-
tient antibiotic prescriptions can be used to in-
form antibiotic stewardship programs in ambu-
latory care by public health and health care
delivery systems in the next 5 years.
This estimate of inappropriate outpatient an-
tibiotic prescriptions is based on deriving an es-
timate for the rate of ambulatory care visits dur-
ing which antibiotics are prescribed when not

indicated and for diagnoses that are overused (eg, sinusitis).
To derive this estimate, a conservative, mixed approach was
used including (1) no reductions for conditions almost always
warranting antibiotics, (2) application of clinical guidelines for
nonbacterial respiratory conditions, (3) an estimate for group
A streptococcal prevalence for pharyngitis, based on evidence-
based guidelines, and (4) use of geographic variability by fo-
cusing on regions with the lowest antibiotic prescribing rates
for suppurative otitis media, sinusitis, and remaining condi-
tions. Previous studies estimating potential estimates of in-
appropriate outpatient antibiotic use have relied solely on es-
timates of bacterial prevalence and have concluded that more
than 50% of antibiotics for acute respiratory tract infections
are unnecessary.17,18 Although knowledge of bacterial patho-
gen presence could be informative, routine performance of si-

ment guidelines for sinusitis and otitis media advocate using
stringent clinical criteria for diagnosis and to identify candi-
dates for watchful waiting and antibiotic therapy,8-10,33 but the
fraction of diagnoses that meet these criteria is unknown.
A substantial amount of antibiotic overuse is likely driven
by overdiagnosis of certain conditions (eg, sinusitis diagnosis
without meeting criteria). Evidence supporting the problem
of overdiagnosis, in particular for sinusitis and otitis media,
includes variability in diagnosis by race and by clinician.34 Al-
though the health of the populations in each region and thus
theneedforantibioticusemayvary,theregionalanalysesfrom
which the estimated appropriate rates are taken are based on
large regions with populations ranging from 55 million (North-
east) to 113 million (South). To our knowledge, no data sug-
gest worse outcomes for these conditions in low-prescribing
regions due to undertreatment; in fact, there is evidence of an-
tibiotic overuse even in low-prescribing regions.20 For pneu-
monia, UTI and miscellaneous bacterial infections, no spe-
cific goal was recommended at this time, even though
overdiagnosis of these conditions likely occurs, particularly
with asymptomatic bacteriuria diagnosed as UTI. For this ef-
fort, the group focused on conditions for which the diagno-
ses often or sometimes do not require antibiotics, rather than
misdiagnosis of conditions almost always requiring antibiot-
ics. Misdiagnosis will present important opportunities in the
future, especially for infections like UTI and community-
acquired pneumonia.
The geographic variation nationally and globally indi-
cates that a 30% reduction in antibiotic prescribing is achiev-
able. Per the sensitivity analysis, if national antibiotic pre-
scriptions rates for targeted diagnoses for each age group were
at the rate of the lowest-prescribing region, prescribing would
be 19% lower than the 2010-2011 rate. However, when low-
prescribing regions are used to produce estimates for appro-
priate prescribing, more antibiotic prescriptions are consid-
ered appropriate than when estimates are based on national
guidelines.
Another study examining dispensed antibiotics found
the lowest-prescribing 5 states dispensed 36% fewer antibi-
otic prescriptions than the United States overall; this study
found a similar pattern to our study of higher prescribing in
the South vs the West.4 Sweden dispensed 328 antibiotic
courses per 1000 population in 20143 compared with 877
antibiotic courses dispensed per 1000 population in the
United States in 2011.35 Sweden has very low rates antibiotic-
resistant infections.36 By reducing antibiotic prescribing for
common infections, 1 potential concern is increasing suppu-
rative complications. However, in Sweden, acute otitis
media diagnoses and antibiotic use decreased during 2000-
2005 by 50%, likely due to stricter diagnostic criteria and
educational campaigns, with no increase in mastoiditis,37 all
prior to introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.38
Effective interventions to reduce inappropriate prescribing,
such as clinician and patient education, audit-and-feedback,
academic detailing, communication training, rapid diagnos-
tics, clinical decision support, and delayed prescriptions,
can be used in ambulatory care settings to improve appropri-
ate antibiotic use.39
Strengths of NAMCS/NHAMCS include national represen-
tativeness and inclusion of both diagnoses and therapy. How-
ever, the use of NAMCS/NHAMCS in this study also has the fol-
lowing limitations. First, the NAMCS and NHAMCS rely on
clinician diagnoses and lack data allowing for validation of di-
agnoses and links between medications and diagnoses. ICD-
9-CM codes, although assigned by NAMCS/NHAMCS staff, lack
specificity to differentiate all diagnoses of interest and may not
fully represent the clinician’
s diagnosis. NAMCS/NHAMCS al-
low for 3 diagnoses, and if the visit lacked antibiotic-
appropriate diagnosis, it was assumed that none existed. How-
ever, all 3 diagnoses fields were used and antibiotic prescribing
was considered appropriate if there was any antibiotic-
appropriate diagnosis.
Second, estimates in NAMCS and NHAMCS are adjusted
for nonresponse for a limited number of variables, and thus
nonresponse bias may be present.40
Third, data from NAMCS and NHAMCS represent visits,
not illness episodes, such that multiple prescriptions for 1
person would be captured separately, and therefore the over-
all estimated rates of antibiotic prescribing per population
and inappropriate prescribing may be overestimated. For
instance, in 2010-2011 in NAMCS/NHAMCS, an estimated 1.2
billion ambulatory care visits occurred annually from a popu-
lation of 305 million people in the United States, suggesting
that, on average, approximately 4 ambulatory care visits
occurred for each person in the United States. In reality, some
individuals had more than 4 ambulatory care visits, and
some had fewer or no visits. Of these projected 1.2 billion vis-
its annually, an estimated 12.6% were associated with antibi-
otic prescriptions, which would equate to a projected 154
million antibiotic prescriptions written annually in these set-
tings or an estimated population-based rate of 506 antibiotic
prescriptions per 1000 US population (ie, every person in the
population would have received 0.5 antibiotic prescriptions
per year from an office or emergency department–based
visit). However, some patients received no antibiotic pre-
scriptions, and some likely received more than 1 antibiotic
prescription. In addition, because some individuals had mul-
tiple visits and would have been sampled multiple times, it is
almost certain that complex patients (who would have many
visits annually) are overrepresented in the study population
compared with truly “typical” patients, and far more than
healthy patients, who may not have had any visits during the
sampling frame. It also is possible that for these complex
patients, what may seem like inappropriate prescriptions
could have been appropriate. Moreover, the more times an
individual sees a physician, the more likely that patient will
get a prescription, independent of whether the prescription
was appropriate or not. However, these multiple exposures
for an individual are treated as “on average” a single expo-
sure for multiple individuals and the data were not adjusted
for comorbidities or for the number of times an individual is
included in the sampling frame, suggesting that the overall
estimated rate of antibiotic prescribing per population may
be biased upward.
Fourth, NAMCS/NHAMCS also have significant time de-
lays, limiting the ability to use data more recent than 2011. The

same analysis of 2008-2009 data showed that antibiotic pre-
scribing patterns were stable from 2008-2011 and that 31% of
2008-2009 outpatient antibiotic prescriptions were unnec-
essary. More recent data indicate that overall outpatient anti-
biotic courses dispensed have remained stable from 2011
through 2013 with 877 and 849 antibiotic courses dispensed
per 1000 population, respectively.35 The rate of antibiotic pre-
scriptions in this study is just more than half the rate of anti-
biotics dispensed in outpatient settings in the United States in
2011.4,35 It is not known how these rates in this study based
on data from 2010-2011 compare or reflect the rates of pre-
scribing in 2016.
Fifth, antibiotics prescribed at urgent care and retail clinic,
federal facilities, hospital discharges, telemedicine encoun-
ters and for long-term care residents are not included in
NAMCS/NHAMCS.Inaddition,visitstophysicianassistantsand
nurse practitioners are not systematically sampled and may
be underrepresented.
Sixth, these data reflect medication mentions, not antibi-
otics dispensed or consumed, and delayed prescriptions can-
not be differentiated from standard prescriptions. Appropri-
ate antibiotic selection was not addressed, but a separate study
is under way to identify opportunities to improve selection.
Conclusions
In the United States in 2010-2011, there was an estimated an-
nual antibiotic prescription rate per 1000 population of 506,
but only an estimated 353 antibiotic prescriptions were likely
appropriate, supporting the need for and establishing a goal
for outpatient antibiotic stewardship.
