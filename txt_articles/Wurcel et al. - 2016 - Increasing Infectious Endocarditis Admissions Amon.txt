People who inject drugs (PWID) are at risk for infective
endocarditis (IE). Hospitalization rates related to misuse of pre-
scription opioids and heroin have increased in recent years, but
there are no recent investigations into rates of hospitalizations
from injection drug use-related IE (IDU-IE). Using the Health
Care and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample
(HCUP-NIS) dataset, we found that the proportion of IE hos-
pitalizations from IDU-IE increased from 7% to 12.1% between
2000 and 2013. Over this time period, we detected a significant
increase in the percentages of IDU-IE hospitalizations among
15- to 34-year-olds (27.1%–42.0%; P < .001) and among whites
(40.2%–68.9%; P < .001). Female gender was less common
when examining all the IDU-IE (40.9%), but it was more com-
mon in the 15- to 34-year-old age group (53%). Our findings
suggest that the demographics of inpatients hospitalized with
IDU-IE are shifting to reflect younger PWID who are more like-
ly to be white and female than previously reported. Future stud-
ies to investigate risk behaviors associated with IDU-IE and
targeted harm reduction strategies are needed to avoid further
increases in morbidity and mortality in this rapidly growing
population of young PWID.

Infective endocarditis (IE) has high rates of morbidity and mor-
tality [1–3]. Although there are multiple risk factors for IE,
including congenital and acquired valve abnormalities, approx-
imately 16% of IE in North America is attributed to injection of
illicit drugs [1].Injection drug use (IDU) can lead to IE through
direct injection of bacteria or through spread from skin and soft
tissue abscesses into the bloodstream. Depending on the criteria
used to define IE, it is estimated that anywhere between 5% and
20% of people who inject drugs (PWID) have had IE [4–6].Peo-
ple with IDU-related IE (IDU-IE) have worse outcomes than
people with non-IDU-IE, including higher mortality after
valve replacement and increased frequency of repeat endocardi-
tis [7, 8]. The most recent US study investigating trends in hos-
pitalizations attributed to IDU-IE reported a 66% increase in
admissions between 1996 and 2003 [9]. The study by Cooper
et al [9] was published before the recent increase in opioid
use in the United States, and it is limited because of likely un-
derreporting of illicit drug use by patients. The goal of the cur-
rent study was to determine whether the increasing opioid
epidemic over the past decade was paralleled by increasing hos-
pitalization trends for IDU-IE. In addition to using the Interna-
tional Classification of Disease, 9th Edition (ICD-9) for drug
use, we used the ICD-9 codes for hepatitis C virus (HCV) to
identify potential IDU-IE because 80% of PWID have HCV
[10].Based on recent evidence that overdose and HCV infection
rates have increased most dramatically in young, white, females,
our goal was to conduct trend analyses looking at changes in
IDU-IE discharges by age, race/ethnicity, and gender [11–17].
METHODS
Data Sources
We analyzed data from the 2000–2013 Nationwide Inpatient
Samples (NIS), which is the largest publicly available all-payer
inpatient health care database in the United States [18]. The
database was developed as a part of the Healthcare Cost and
Utilization Project (HCUP), sponsored by the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality. From 2000 through 2011,
the NIS includes all discharges from 20% of community hospi-
tals from participating states. From 2012 through 2013, the NIS
includes a 20% stratified sample of all discharges from commu-
nity hospitals from participating states. Community hospitals
are defined by HCUP as short-term, non-Federal, general and
other hospitals, excluding hospital units of other institutions
(eg, prisons, rehabilitation and long-term hospitals). The
sample was weighted in order to produce national estimate.
Approximately 5–8 million discharges are recorded in the NIS
annually. Information for each de-identified discharge includes
age, race, gender, as well as diagnosis and procedure codes.
The NIS has been used in many studies to estimate trends in
hospitalizations for a variety of medical conditions including
but not limited to HCV and mental and substance abuse disor-
ders [17, 19–21]. We applied for and received an exemption

 from the Tufts Health Sciences Institutional Review Board be-
cause the data from NIS are de-identified.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
We used ICD-9 codes 421.0, 421.9, 424.90, 424.91, and 424.99
to identify admissions with IE. First, we limited discharges to
patients aged 15–64 in order to exclude older patients who
may have contracted endocarditis from non-IDU risks such
as degenerative valvular disease. Second, we classified each pa-
tient as presenting with IDU risks based on ICD-9 codes for
(1) illicit drug use codes or diagnosis or (2) HCV (codes
70.40, 70.44, 70.51, 70.54, 70.70, 70.71, V0262).
We excluded discharges with any ICD-9 codes for specific
endocarditis risk factors (rheumatic heart disease and congen-
ital heart disease) that we speculated likely preceded initiation
of IDU. Our inclusion and exclusion criteria were based on an
algorithm published by Cooper et al [9] in 2007. We used
diagnosis codes and procedures related to commonly injected
illicit drugs (e.g., cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine) that
were identical to those used in Cooper’s algorithm. We made
slight modifications, including the following: (1) a lowered
inclusion age from 16 to 15 years, (2) addition of HCV
ICD-9 codes, and (3) inclusion of patients with a record of
other heart problems (prior prosthetic valve, hemodialysis,
pacemaker, heart catheterization, intracardiac balloon). We
added the last modification because although these conditions
could predispose the patient to endocarditis, they could also be
complications of endocarditis [9]. Because the admissions
to the database have separate identifications with no ability
to link admissions to previous or subsequent admissions, it
is impossible to know whether heart problems were the
cause or the result of endocarditis.
Statistical Analysis
For statistical analysis, we first computed the rate of IDU-IE by
year to observe the trend for the whole selected sample and then
stratified by the following: (1) 3 age groups at 15–34, 35–54, and
55–64 years; (2) race/ethnicity, ie, white and non-white;
(3) race/ethnicity aged 15–34; and (4) gender. We conducted
statistical analyses using Stata 13.1 (StataCorp, College Station,
TX) and SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Microsoft Excel
was used to compose graphs. Statistical significance was deter-
mined based on the threshold of P < .05. We incorporated the
sample weights provided by the NIS to generate representative
estimates; all results presented are weighted unless otherwise
specified.
RESULTS
We identified a total of 16 206 unweighted hospitalizations
(76 126 weighted) with IE ICD-9 codes between 2000 and
2013. The weighted number of IE hospitalizations increased
from 51 291 in 2000 to 70 740 in 2013, and the number of
IDU-IE hospitalizations increased from 3578 to 8530 during
this time (Figure 1A). The proportion of hospitalizations due
to IDU-IE remained stable at approximately 7%–8% until
2008 when there was a decrease to 6.1% followed by an increase
to 12.1% in 2013. The IDU-IE hospitalization trends, stratified
by age group, are summarized in Figure 1B. We found that the
percentage of IDU-IE hospitalizations among young adults
(15–34 years) steadily increased from 2000 to 2013, with a
steep increase from 2008 to 2013 (27.7%–42.0%; P < .001
using χ2 test for trend in proportions). In contrast, IDU-IE
rates among middle-aged adults (ages 35–54) steadily decreased
between 2000 and 2013 (67.2%–39.9%; P < .001). Injection drug
use-related IE increased in whites from 40.2% in 2000 to 68.9%
in 2013 (P < .001) (Figure 1C). We also detected an increasing
trend in younger whites, where the proportion of IDU-IE in-
creased from 57.0% in 2000 to 80.3% in 2013 (P < .001) (Fig-
ure 1D). Female gender was less common when examining all
the IDU-IE (female = 40.9%); however, in the 15- to 34-year-
old age group, there is greater parity in IDU-IE distribution
by sex (female = 53%). There were no significant changes in
IDU-IE hospitalizations by gender over time (data not shown).
We noted transition from a unimodal to bimodal age distribution
of IDU-IE hospitalizations over time, indicating a shift toward in-
creased proportions in younger populations (Figure 2).
DISCUSSION
The results of our study demonstrate that trends in IDU-IE hos-
pitalizations appear to mirror those of the intertwined prescrip-
tion opioid, heroin, HCV, and overdose epidemics throughout
the country. The proportion of IDU-IE hospitalizations occur-
ring in young, white people is increasing. It is noteworthy to
mention that we identified a bimodal age distribution in
IDU-IE similar to that of recent HCV age distributions in Mas-
sachusetts, with peaks in IDU-IE (and HCV) in younger and
older populations [11]. The increase in infections seen in
young PWID may represent (1) a stable IE risk in a growing
subgroup of PWID or (2) behaviors specific to the younger pop-
ulations that put them at higher risk.
It has been almost a decade since the last investigation into
demographic trends in hospitalization attributed to IDU-IE.
Our analysis has important clinical, financial, and public
health implications. Infective endocarditis can vary in severity,
but overall it is an extremely morbid disease with 11%–26% in-
hospital mortality and estimated 12%–50% 5-year mortality
[1, 22, 23]. Hospital officials and practitioners agree that care
for IDU-IE is expensive and prolonged. It often involves multi-
disciplinary medical, surgical, nursing, and case-management
collaborations. After hospitalization, the care continuum for
PWID relies upon a myriad of public health organizations, so-
cial service agencies, corrections institutions, and emergency
and outpatient clinicians. The cumulative expense of care for

 IDU-IE poses increasing financial burdens for healthcare
facilities and insurance companies, because the majority of
patients with hospitalizations from IDU are unemployed or
underemployed and are reliant on publically funded medical
insurance [24, 25]. Rosenthal et al [26] showed that readmission
rates in IDU-IE are high (approximately 50%), implying

 increased costs and poorer outcomes. Rates of treatment for
opioid addiction by opioid-replacement therapy after hospital-
ization are very low (<8%) [26]. Increasing awareness of the
need and financial support for harm reduction services, includ-
ing needle-exchange programs and opioid substitution pro-
grams, may not only reduce morbidity and mortality from
IDU-IE but may also be cost-saving.
Our findings should be considered because of several limita-
tions tied to analysis of health claims data. Our results are
only generalizable to PWID who seek medical care in HCUP-
participating hospitals. Our classifications are based on ICD-9
data extrapolated from clinical interactions. We expanded the
criteria for the definition of IDU-IE from Cooper et al [27] by
allowing for HCV-ICD-9 to serve as a proxy for IDU. Given
that illicit drug use is underreported and is a major risk factor
for HCV infection, expansion of the definition for PWID by the
addition of HCV codes should better capture hospitalizations
likely to be attributable to IDU-IE. However, there has been
increased awareness of HCV among healthcare providers, so
increases in IDU-IE diagnoses in this study may be partly attrib-
uted to increased testing for HCV during recent years. There
was heterogeneity by age groups in how people met the inclu-
sion criteria for IDU-IE. In the 15- to 34-year-old population,
90% were classified as IDU-IE based on presence of IDU diag-
nosis or procedure ICD-9 code, whereas older populations were
more likely to be identified by HCV ICD-9 codes. Only 40% of
55- to 64-year-olds were classified as IDU-IE by IDU diagnosis
or procedure codes. Thus, inclusion of HCV diagnosis in our
operational definition did not appear to influence our key find-
ings among younger white PWID.
CONCLUSIONS
Our findings add to the growing body of scientific literature that
demonstrates increasing concerns about substance misuse,
injection-mediated risks, and a constellation of comorbidities
within younger populations [12–14, 16, 21, 28–33]. Our results
provide additional insights into the complex mix of infectious
diseases that face PWID and are a harbinger of healthcare uti-
lization patterns to come among young adults in the throes of
addiction. Future research efforts should include interventional
studies with PWID that will facilitate identification of factors as-
sociated with IDU-IE, helping to inform future public health
prevention and clinical policies.
