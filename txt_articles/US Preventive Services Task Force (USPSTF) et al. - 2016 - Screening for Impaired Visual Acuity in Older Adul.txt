Summary of Recommendation and Evidence
The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to
assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for impaired
visual acuity in older adults. (I statement) (Figure 1)

gestions for practice regarding the I statement.
Rationale
Importance

adults. In 2011, about 12% of US adults aged 65 to 74 years and 15%
of those 75 years or older reported having problems seeing, even
with glasses or contact lenses.
Detection
The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening with a vi-
sual acuity test can identify persons with a refractive error. The
USPSTFfoundconvincingevidencethatscreeningquestionsarenot
as accurate as visual acuity testing for assessing visual acuity. The
USPSTF found adequate evidence that visual acuity testing alone
does not accurately identify early age-related macular degenera-
tion (AMD) or cataracts.
Benefits of Detection and Early Treatment
The USPSTF found inadequate overall evidence on the benefits of
screening, early detection, and treatment to provide a coherent
assessment of the overall benefits. Several studies evaluated the
direct benefit of screening and reported no reductions in vision dis-
orders or vision-related function in screened populations; however,
these studies had limitations, including differing control interven-
tions, high loss to follow-up, and low uptake of treatment. The
USPSTF found adequate evidence that early treatment of refrac-
tive error, cataracts, and AMD improves or prevents loss of visual
acuity.
Harms of Detection and Early Treatment
The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screen-
ing. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that early treatment of
refractiveerror,cataracts,andAMDmayleadtoharmsthataresmall
to none.
DESCRIPTION Update of the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation
on screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults.
METHODS The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for visual acuity impairment
associated with uncorrected refractive error, cataracts, and age-related macular degeneration
among adults 65 years or older in the primary care setting; the benefits and harms of screening;
the accuracy of screening; and the benefits and harms of treatment of early vision impairment
due to uncorrected refractive error, cataracts, and age-related macular degeneration.
POPULATION This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults 65 years or older who do
not present to their primary care clinician with vision problems.
RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess
the balance of benefits and harms of screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults.

USPSTF Assessment
The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess
the balance of benefits and harms of screening for impaired visual
acuity in older adults. The evidence is lacking to provide a coher-
ent assessment, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be
determined.
Clinical Considerations
Patient Population Under Consideration
This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults 65 years or
older who do not present to their primary care clinician with vision
problems (Figure 2).
Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement
Potential Preventable Burden
In2011,about12%ofUSadultsaged65to74yearsand15%ofthose
75yearsorolderreportedhavingproblemsseeing,evenwithglasses
or contact lenses.1 The prevalence of AMD is 6.5% in adults older
than 40 years and increases with age (2.8% in those aged 40-59
years and 13.4% in those aged �60 years).2 About half of all cases
of bilateral low vision (ie, best-corrected visual acuity of <20/40) in
adults 40 years and older are caused by cataracts. The prevalence
of cataracts increases sharply with age; an estimated 50% of US
adults 80 years or older have cataracts.1 The prevalence of hypero-
piarequiringacorrectionof+3.0dioptersormorerangesfromabout
5.9% in US adults aged 50 to 54 years, to 15.2% in adults aged 65
to 69 years, to 20.4% in adults 80 years or older.1

What the USPSTF Grades Mean and Suggestions for Practice
Grade
Definition
A
The USPSTF recommends the service. There is high certainty that the net benefit is substantial.
Offer or provide this service.
Suggestions for Practice
B
The USPSTF recommends the service. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or
there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial.
Offer or provide this service.
C
The USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing this service to individual patients
based on professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty
that the net benefit is small.
Offer or provide this service for selected
patients depending on individual
circumstances.
D
The USPSTF recommends against the service. There is moderate or high certainty that the service
has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits.
Discourage the use of this service.
I statement
The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits
and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of
benefits and harms cannot be determined.
Read the Clinical Considerations section
of the USPSTF Recommendation
Statement. If the service is offered,
patients should understand the
uncertainty about the balance of benefits
and harms.
USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit
Level of Certainty
Description
High
The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care
populations. These studies assess the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes. This conclusion is therefore unlikely to be
strongly affected by the results of future studies.
Moderate
The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate
is constrained by such factors as 
the number, size, or quality of individual studies.
inconsistency of findings across individual studies.
limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice.
lack of coherence in the chain of evidence.
As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large
enough to alter the conclusion.
The USPSTF defines certainty as “likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct.” The net benefit is defined as
benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature
of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.
Low
The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of
the limited number or size of studies.
important flaws in study design or methods.
inconsistency of findings across individual studies.
gaps in the chain of evidence.
findings not generalizable to routine primary care practice.
lack of information on important health outcomes.
More information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes.

Older age is an important risk factor for most types of visual
impairment. Additional risk factors for cataracts are smoking,
alcohol use, UV light exposure, diabetes, corticosteroid use, and
black race. Risk factors for AMD include smoking, family history,
and white race.1
Potential Harms
The harms of screening in a primary care setting have not been
adequately studied. Overall, the potential for harms from treat-
ment are small to none. Harms of treatment of refractive error
include a potential for increased falls with the use of multifocal
lenses; infectious keratitis with the use of contact lenses, laser-
assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), or laser-assisted subepi-
thelial keratectomy (LASEK); and corneal ectasia with LASIK.
Harms of cataract surgery include posterior lens opacification and
endophthalmitis. Treatment of AMD with antioxidant vitamins
and mineral supplements is not associated with increased risk of
most serious adverse events.
Although there appears to be benefit in longer-term
outcomes, a systematic review found that treatment of AMD
with laser photocoagulation was associated with greater risk
of acute loss of 6 or more lines of visual acuity vs no treat-
ment at 3 months (relative risk [RR], 1.41 [95% CI, 1.08-1.82]).3
Pooled estimates report a non–statistically significant association
between photodynamic therapy and risk of acute loss of
20 or more letters of visual acuity vs placebo at 7 days (RR, 3.75
[95% CI, 0.87-16]) (3 trials).4,5 One of 2 trials found that
treatment of wet AMD with intravitreal vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor therapy was associated with
greater likelihood of withdrawal vs sham therapy; there were no
differences in serious or other adverse events, but estimates
were imprecise.1,4,6,7
Current Practice
About half of US adults older than 65 years reported having an eye
examination within the last 12 months in a 2007 study.8
Screening Tests
A visual acuity test (eg, the Snellen eye chart) is the usual method
for screening for visual acuity impairment in the primary care set-
ting. Screening questions are not as accurate as visual acuity test-
ing for identifying visual acuity impairment. Evidence on the
use of other tests for vision screening in primary care, such as
the pinhole test (a test for refractive error), the Amsler grid (a test
of central vision to detect AMD), genetic testing, or funduscopy
(visual inspection of the interior of the eye), is lacking.
Treatment
Several types of treatment are effective for improving visual acu-
ity. Corrective lenses improve visual acuity in patients with a
refractive error. Treatment of cataracts through surgical removal
of the cataract is effective for improving visual acuity. Treatment
of exudative (or wet) AMD includes laser photocoagulation,
verteporfin, and intravitreal injections of VEGF inhibitors. Antioxi-
dant vitamins and minerals are an effective treatment for
dry AMD.

Discussion
Burden of Disease
Vision impairment is common in older adults. Older adults have a
higher prevalence of primary ocular disease and systemic diseases
associatedwithoculardiseasethanyoungeradults;inaddition,older
adults also have normal age-related changes in vision (ie, presby-
opia).In2011,anestimated12%ofUSadultsaged65to74yearsand
15% of those 75 years or older reported vision loss.1
Refractive error, AMD, and cataracts are common causes of
visionimpairmentinolderadults.Severerefractiveerror(requiring
correctionof�+3.0diopters)affectsanestimated6%ofUSadults
aged50to54years,15%ofadultsaged65to69years,and20%of
adults 80 years or older.1 About 60% of all cases of refractive error
are deemed correctable to better than 20/40 visual acuity.9 In the
United States, more than 15 million adults older than 65 years have
cataracts, and it is the most common cause of blindness in black
adults older than 40 years. Age-related macular degeneration af-
fects1.5millionolderadultsintheUnitedStatesandisthemostcom-
mon cause of blindness in white adults.2,10
Scope of Review
In 2009, the USPSTF issued an I statement on screening for im-
paired visual acuity in older adults. To update this I statement, the
USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to focus on evidence
published since its last review. The USPSTF reviewed evidence on
screening for visual acuity impairment associated with uncor-
rectedrefractiveerror,cataracts,andAMDinadults65yearsorolder
in the primary care setting. The USPSTF also reviewed the evi-
dence on the benefits and harms of screening, the accuracy of
screening, and the benefits and harms of treatment of early vision
impairmentduetouncorrectedrefractiveerror,cataracts,andAMD.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
Askingscreeningquestionstoelicitself-perceivedproblemswithvi-
sion has been studied as a screening method. However, compared
with a standard eye chart, screening questions are not accurate for
identifying persons with vision impairment.1,4
In the United States, a standardized visual acuity test is the
usual method for identifying the presence of vision impairment.
Visual acuity tests assess the patient’
s ability to recognize letters
of different sizes arranged in rows from a prespecified distance
(typically 20 feet). Standardized visual acuity tests are good at
identifying refractive error.
Comparedwithadetailedophthalmologicalexamination,novi-
sualacuityscreeningtesthasbothhighsensitivityandspecificityfor
the diagnosis of any underlying visual condition (eg, AMD or cata-
racts).FewstudieshavefocusedontheaccuracyoftheAmslergrid,
clinical examination, pinhole test, or fundus examination in the pri-
mary care setting. One study on the Amsler grid reported poor ac-
curacy for detecting any visual condition compared with ophthal-
mological examination, and 1 study reported that geriatricians
correctly identified most patients with cataracts and AMD through
a clinical examination.1,4
Two studies from 2012 evaluated the accuracy of the Com-
puter Vision Screen and its flip-chart version compared with a
“
gold standard”eye examination that included detailed history,
symptoms, and a comprehensive eye examination. These studies
reported moderate sensitivity (0.75 to 0.80) and specificity (0.68
to 0.77).11 A third study from 2009 evaluated the accuracy of the
Minimum Data Set 2.0 Vision Patterns section compared with a
standard visual acuity test. The study reported poor accuracy,
depending on the cutoff score; sensitivity ranged from 0.11 to 0.52
and specificity ranged from 0.25 to 0.96.12 These studies had
methodological limitations, including uncertainty as to whether
the reference standard was interpreted independently from the
screening test and the lack of a predefined threshold to determine
a positive result.
Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
There is limited direct evidence on the effectiveness of screening
for visual impairment in the primary care setting. Three fair-quality
cluster randomized clinical trials (RCTs) found no difference in
vision and other clinical or functional outcomes between vision
screening (as part of a multicomponent screening) with visual acu-
ity testing or questions compared with usual care, no vision
screening, or delayed screening.13-15 The application of this evi-
dence to screening in a primary care setting has limitations. Issues
with the study methods include failure to report allocation con-
cealment, lack of intention-to-treat analysis, and unclear blinding
of outcome assessors.4 Other limitations relevant to the primary
care setting include that the recommended interventions are pro-
vided by eye care specialists and that many patients do not get the
recommended glasses.
Consistent evidence shows that most older adults with a
refractive error can achieve visual acuity better than 20/40 with
refractive correction. Evidence from a few trials indicates that
immediate correction of refractive error with eyeglasses in older
adults is associated with improved short-term vision-related qual-
ity of life or function compared with delayed treatment. A 2005
systematic review of 179 RCTs and observational studies found
that refractive surgery was highly effective at improving refractive
error; 92% to 94% of persons with myopia and 86% to 96% of
persons with hyperopia achieved visual acuity of 20/40 or better.
However, most of these studies were done in younger adults, lim-
iting its generalizability to older adults.16

(composedofvitaminsCandEandbetacarotenewithzinc)wasas-
sociated with reduced likelihood of progression to advanced AMD
(adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.68); however, the between-group dif-
ferences in the likelihood of losing measurable visual acuity did not
reach statistical significance. A 10-year follow-up study of the Age-
Related Eye Disease Study published in 2009 reported similar re-
sults; an antioxidant multivitamin with zinc was associated with
reducedlikelihoodofprogressionofAMD(OR,0.66[95%CI,0.53-

provements in vision-related functional scores in the treatment
group, and 1 trial reported a higher likelihood of driving in the treat-
ment group.1
Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
No studies are available on the harms of screening in a primary care
setting.Severalstudiesevaluatedtheharmsoftreatmentofrefrac-
tive error, cataracts, and AMD. Most of these studies are older and
were reviewed for the 2009 USPSTF recommendation. Data on
harms of treatment of refractive error in older adults are limited. A
small observational study reported an association between multi-
focal lens use and increased risk of falls in older adults.24 Serious
harms, including vision loss, are rare as a result of contact lens use
or refractive surgery. Corneal ectasia, a thinning and bulging of the
cornea, is a known harm of refractive surgery and occurs at a me-
dian rate of 0.2%.1,4 Cataract surgery can lead to posterior capsule
opacificationoftheimplantedlens,requiringfurtherprocedures;re-
portedratesofthiscomplicationvarywidelyfrom0.7%to48%.17,25
A systematic review from 1998 reported an incidence of 28% at 5
years.26Endophthalmitis,bullouskeratopathy,dislocationofintra-
ocularlens,macularedema,andretinaldetachmentareothercom-
plications associated with cataract surgery.
Pooled data on the harms of treatment of AMD from trials of
antioxidantvitaminsandmineralsreportednoassociationwithwith-
drawal due to gastrointestinal symptoms.1,4 The largest trial re-
ported an increased risk of hospitalization due to genitourinary
causes with zinc and an increased risk of yellowing skin with anti-
oxidants; it found no association with death or lung cancer.1,4 Two
trials on the treatment of early AMD reported no association be-
tween supplement use and any adverse event, serious adverse
events,seriousocularevents,orwithdrawalduetoadverseevents.1
Treatment of wet AMD with laser photocoagulation is associ-
ated with increased risk of acute visual acuity loss at 3 months
after the procedure but, as described earlier, is also associated
with reduced risk of visual acuity loss at 2 years.1,4 Photodynamic
therapy with verteporfin carries an initial risk of acute visual acuity
loss and greater risk of back pain related to the infusion.5 Other
reported harms of photodynamic therapy include visual distur-
bance, injection site reactions, and photosensitivity. Potential
harms associated with intravitreal injections of VEGF inhibitors
include endophthalmitis, uveitis, increased intraocular pressure,
traumatic lens injury, and retinal detachment.1,4 In 3 trials, these
outcomes were infrequent, and differences between the interven-
tion and sham therapy groups were not statistically significant;
however, estimates were imprecise, with wide CIs given the rarity
of these outcomes.1,6,7,27
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit

are small; however, many of the treatments carry a small risk of se-
rious complications, including acute visual loss. Although treat-
ments that entail little harm can correct impaired visual acuity, lim-
ited evidence is available on the effect of screening and treatment
on quality of life and overall and vision-related function, especially
in older adults with screen-detected visual problems.

Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation
Thisrecommendationisanupdateofthe2009USPSTFrecommen-
dationonscreeningforimpairedvisualacuityinolderadults,which
also concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the bal-
ance of benefits and harms of screening for visual acuity for the im-
provement of outcomes in older adults.
Recommendations of Others
The American Optometric Association recommends that asymp-
tomatic adults 61 years and older receive an eye examination
every year.28 The American Academy of Ophthalmology recom-
mends a comprehensive eye examination that includes visual
acuity testing and dilation every 1 to 2 years for all adults 65 years
or older who do not have risk factors or more frequently if risk fac-
tors are present.29 This recommendation is based on descriptive
studies, case reports, and expert consensus. The American Acad-
emy of Family Physicians’recommendation is consistent with that
of the USPSTF statement: the current evidence is insufficient to
assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for impaired
visual acuity, or vision impairment, in adults 65 years and older
who have not reported problems with vision.30 The American
Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that
vision assessment be a part of well-woman visits for all women 65
years or older.31
