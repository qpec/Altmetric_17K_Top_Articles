Purpose:
To explore cerebral alterations related to the emergence 
of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by using three-
dimensional T1-weighted imaging and also to explore the 
relationship of gray and white matter abnormalities and 
the anatomic changes with clinical severity and duration 
of time since the trauma.
Materials and 
Methods:
Informed consent was provided, and the prospective 
study was approved by the ethics committee of the West 
China Hospital. Recruited were 67 patients with PTSD 
and 78 adult survivors without PTSD 7–15 months after a 
devastating earthquake in western China. All participants 
underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with a 3-T 
imager to obtain anatomic images. Cortical thickness and 
volumes of 14 subcortical gray matter structures and five 
subregions of the corpus callosum were analyzed with 
software. Statistical differences between patients with 
PTSD and healthy survivors were evaluated with a general 
linear model. Averaged data from the regions with volu-
metric or cortical thickness differences between groups 
were extracted in each individual to examine correlations 
between morphometric measures and clinical profiles.
Results:
Patients with PTSD showed greater cortical thickness in 
the right superior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, 
and left precuneus (P , .05; Monte Carlo null-z simula-
tion corrected) and showed reduced volume in the poste-
rior portion of the corpus callosum (F = 6.167; P = .014) 
compared with healthy survivors of the earthquake. PTSD 
severity was positively correlated with cortical thickness 
in the left precuneus (r = 0.332; P = .008). The volumes of 
posterior corpus callosum were negatively correlated with 
PTSD ratings in all survivors (r = 20.210; P = .013) and 
with cortical thickness of the left precuneus in patients 
with PTSD (r = 20.302; P = .017).
Conclusion:
Results indicate that patients with PTSD had alterations 
in both cerebral gray matter and white matter compared 
with individuals who experienced similar psychologic 
trauma from the same stressor. Importantly, early in the 
course of PTSD, gray matter changes were in the form 
of increased, not decreased, cortical thickness, which 
may have resulted from neuroinflammatory or other tro-
phic process related to endocrine changes or functional 
compensation.

and the anatomic changes with clinical 
severity and duration of time since the 
trauma.
Materials and Methods
Participants
All participants gave informed consent 
before participation, and the study was 
approved by the ethics committee of 
the West China Hospital of Sichuan 
University. Subjects were recruited and 
studied between January 2009 and Au-
gust 2009 and selected through a large-
scale survey, in which 4200 earthquake 
survivors were screened. The inclusion 
criteria for all screened survivors was 
direct exposure to the massive destruc-
tion, medical injury, and deaths from 
the earthquake. We ensured similar 
trauma exposure by using a question-
naire. The participants were initially 
evaluated by trained earthquake support 
psychologists who used the Clinician-
Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), and 
participants with a CAPS score of 50 
or greater were further evaluated by a 
psychiatrist with the Structured Clinical 
Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders IV Axis I 
disorders to determine the presence or 
absence of PTSD and other psychiatric 
diagnoses. Exclusion criteria for both 
groups included a history of psychiatric 
that occur above and beyond general 
stress responses.
Second, gray matter volume reduc-
tion in patients with PTSD was best es-
tablished in those with chronic PTSD. 
For example, studies of military vet-
erans with chronic PTSD consistently 
demonstrated reduced cortical thick-
ness in various brain regions (3–6), 
whereas studies of patients with PTSD 
recently exposed to trauma reported in-
creased (7) or decreased cortical thick-
ness (8), or both (9). Moreover, most 
MR imaging studies of early-course pa-
tients with PTSD recruited small sam-
ples (8,9).
A third important issue in PTSD 
research is separating stress responses 
related to single specific trauma versus 
the consequences of persistent diverse 
adverse circumstances where multiple 
secondary factors, including medication 
effects, might affect brain anatomy and 
function.
Finally, a fourth issue in previous 
PTSD studies is that gray and white 
matter alterations were typically con-
sidered independently in different stud-
ies. Because neuronal changes in gray 
matter may affect axonal projections, 
alterations in gray and white matter 
may be interrelated. Thus, it may be 
worthwhile to examine gray and white 
matter changes in the same population 
and to explore their interrelationships.
Thus, in the current study, we aimed 
to explore cerebral alterations related 
to the emergence of PTSD by using 
three-dimensional T1-weighted imaging 
and also to explore the relationship of 
gray and white matter abnormalities

Advances in Knowledge
 
n By using structural MR imaging, 
we found the group with post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 
had increased cortical thickness 
of the left precuneus and the 
posterior part of the right supe-
rior temporal gyrus compared 
with healthy survivors (P , .05; 
Monte Carlo null-z simulation 
corrected).
 
n The total scores of Clinician-
Administered PTSD Scale, which 
reflects PTSD illness severity, 
were positively correlated with 
cortical thickness in the left pre-
cuneus (r = 0.332; P = .008).
 
n Region-of-interest analysis dem-
onstrated that the volume of pos-
terior corpus callosum in 
patients with PTSD was smaller 
than in healthy survivors (F = 
6.167, P = .014), and it was neg-
atively correlated with cortical 
thickness in the left precuneus in 
patients with PTSD (r = 20.302; 
P = .017).
Implication for Patient Care
 
n We demonstrated a potential 
structural neural basis of default-
mode network alterations in 
patients with PTSD that was re-
lated to clinical symptom se-
verity; these findings significantly 
advance mechanistic under-
standing of early brain changes 
that determine whether severe 
emotional trauma will lead to 
PTSD.
P
osttraumatic 
stress 
disorder 
(PTSD) is a highly disabling 
trauma- and stressor-related dis-
order, and in a survey of the American 
general population (1) it had a lifetime 
prevalence rate of up to 6.8%. There 
is a substantial need for a better un-
derstanding of the neurobiological dys-
functions that underlie PTSD to develop 
improved diagnostic and treatment pro-
grams. Structural magnetic resonance 
(MR) imaging can provide useful infor-
mation about neuroanatomical alter-
ations in PTSD; however, there are sev-
eral methodologic and scientific issues 
that remain unanswered regarding the 
nature of cerebral structural alterations 
in PTSD.
First, there were significant differ-
ences among voxel-based morphometry 
results in PTSD research when different 
control groups were used (2). It is par-
ticularly important to compare patients 
with PTSD with similarly stressed indi-
viduals to learn about the specific brain 
alterations directly related to PTSD

with sex as a discrete factor and age, 
years of education, duration from the 
earthquake, and intracranial volume 
as covariates. The resulting maps were 
corrected for multiple comparisons by 
using a Monte Carlo null-z simulation 
with 10 
000 iterations. Clusters with a 
corrected cluster-wise P value of less 
than .05 were considered significant.
Region-of-interest 
analyses.—Re-
gion-of-interest volume differences be-
tween patients with PTSD and healthy 
survivors were compared by using a 
general linear model with age, sex, 
years of education, duration from the 
earthquake, and intracranial volume as 
covariates.

tion thickness, 1 mm; field of view, 24 
3 24 cm2; and 256 3 256 matrix). An 
experienced radiologist evaluated and 
verified image quality.
Image Processing
Image preprocessing and statistical 
analyses were performed by three au-
thors (S.Li., X.H., and S.Lui., with 2, 
7, and 9 years of experience, respec-
tively, in MR image analysis). We used 
the FreeSurfer 5.0.0 software package 
(http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) 
to create a three-dimensional model of 
the cortical surface for cortical thick-
ness measurements. This process in-
cludes segmentation of white matter, 
tessellation of gray and white matter 
junctions, inflation of the folded surface 
tessellation patterns, and automatic 
correction of topologic defects. The 
thickness of the cortex of each par-
ticipant was defined as the shortest 
distance between the gray-and-white 
and pial surface models at each vertex 
of a uniform 1-mm grid. Surface maps 
were smoothed with a full-width half-
maximum Gaussian kernel of 10 mm, 
and then averaged across participants 
after aligning cortical folding patterns 
by using a nonrigid high-dimensional 
spherical averaging method (10).
Referring 
to 
region-of-interest 
analysis, volumes of 14 subcortical gray 
matter structures, including bilateral 
hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, nu-
cleus accumbens, caudate, putamen, 
and pallidum, and five white-matter 
structures (five subregions of the 
corpus callosum) were obtained from 
an automated procedure for volumetric 
measurements implemented by using 
software (FreeSurfer).
Statistical Analysis
Cortical 
thickness 
analysis.—Differ-
ences between patients with PTSD and 
healthy survivors were evaluated with 
the general linear model functionality 
within QDEC, which is the graphical 
interface for analyzing group data in 
FreeSurfer. Left and right hemispheres 
were analyzed separately. We tested 
for group differences in vertex-wise 
maps by using a general linear model 
disorder before the earthquake, preg-
nancy, current comorbid psychiatric 
disorders, head injury, any other signif-
icant medical or neurologic conditions, 
drug dependence, and systemic medical 
illness thought to interfere with brain 
function. The recruitment of partici-
pants was performed by four authors 
(S.Li., X.H., L.L., and J.L., with 6, 10, 
25, and 20 years of experience, respec-
tively, in psychologic and psychiatric 
assessment). Conventional MR images 
were evaluated by two experienced neu-
roradiologists (S.Li. and S.Lui, with 15 
and 9 years of experience in neuroim-
aging, respectively) to exclude partici-
pants with gross brain abnormalities. 
Initially, 399 patients with PTSD were 
found by using a community survey. Of 
these, 134 (33.6%) individuals were 
excluded with other psychiatric comor-
bidities, significant previous trauma 
exposure, or alcohol abuse; 12 (3.0%) 
had a history of closed head injury; 58 
(14.5%) had significant medical or neu-
rologic conditions; 81 (20.3%) had MR 
imaging contraindication; 16 (4.0%) 
were left-handed; and 16 (4.0%) pro-
vided insufficient background informa-
tion relevant to inclusion. We excluded 
10 (2.5%) individuals who were older 
than 60 years or younger than 18 years, 
and we excluded five (1.2%) individuals 
on the basis of brain lesions identified 
with MR imaging. Finally, 67 (16.8%) 
patients with first-episode PTSD who 
had not yet received medical treatment 
before MR imaging (men, mean age, 
42.0 years 6 12.2; women, mean age, 
41.8 years 6 8.9; overall age range, 
 
18–60 years; 23 men) and a matched 
group of 78 healthy survivors (men, 
mean age, 43.1 years 6 11.4; women, 
mean age, 44.1 years 6 9.6; overall 
range, 18–60 years; 24 men) were re-
cruited according to the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria (Fig 1).
Brain Imaging
All participants underwent MR imaging 
with a 3-T MR imaging system (Excite; 
GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis). Ana-
tomic images were acquired by using a 
T1-weighted three-dimensional spoiled 
gradient-recalled sequence (repetition 
time [msec]/echo time [msec], 8.5/3.4;

positively correlated with cortical thick-
ness in the left precuneus (r = 0.332; 
P = .008; Fig 2). Volumes of posterior 
corpus callosum were negatively corre-
lated with cortical thickness in the left 
precuneus in patients with PTSD (r = 
20.302; P = .017; Fig 3).
Discussion
We investigated structural brain alter-
ations in a large group of adult patients 
with PTSD who had not undergone 
treatment and who had relatively recent 
onset of illness and similarly stressed 
healthy survivors who were recently 
exposed to the relatively discrete and 
intense psychologic trauma of a dev-
astating earthquake. Compared with 
healthy survivors, patients with PTSD 
demonstrated alterations of cerebral 
structure, including increased cortical 
thickness in the right superior tempo-
ral gyrus, right inferior parietal lobule, 
and the left precuneus, and decreased 
volume of posterior corpus callosum. 
Also, the cortical thickness in the left 
precuneus correlated positively with 
the PTSD symptom severity (assessed 
by CAPS scores) and negatively with 
volumes of posterior corpus callosum.
There are three important findings 
from the current study. First, volume 
change of corpus callosum in adult pa-
tients with PTSD relative to trauma 
survivors without PTSD was specific to 
the posterior part of corpus callosum, 
the splenium, which mainly includes 
interhemispheric connections between 
contralateral visual processing regions 
that include the inferior parietal lobule, 
and precuneus and posterior superior 
temporal sulcus (11). Interestingly, 
regions that demonstrated increased 
cortex thickness all received major af-
ferent and efferent projections through 
the splenium, which was the specific 
region of corpus callosum with volume 
reduction. The correlation observed 
between reduced volume of posterior 
corpus callosum and increased cortical 
thickness in left precuneus suggested 
that pathologic changes in medial pa-
rietal cortex may lead to disruption in 
fiber projections from these regions 
through posterior corpus callosum, 
cluster was located in the left precuneus 
(area, 765.87 mm2; cluster maxima Ta-
lairach coordinates, x = 29.3, y = 249.5, 
z = 42.4; cluster probability, 0.037; 
 
Fig 2). The second cluster extended 
from the posterior area of the right su-
perior temporal gyrus to the right infe-
rior parietal lobule (area, 1711.85 mm2; 
cluster maxima Talairach coordinates, x 
= 63.5, y = 233.5, z = 9.8; cluster prob-
ability, 0.0001; Fig 2). There were no 
regions of significant cortical thinning in 
the patients with PTSD compared with 
healthy earthquake survivors. Findings 
were similar regardless of whether du-
ration of time between the earthquake 
and examinations were considered as 
covariates.
The average volumes for each group 
in structures of interest and the statis-
tical results of group comparison are 
shown in Table 2. Of the 14 subcortical 
gray matter structures and five white 
matter structures selected for volumet-
ric measurement, only the posterior 
portion of corpus callosum showed a 
significant difference between the two 
groups (F = 6.167; P = .014). The vol-
ume of posterior corpus callosum in 
patients with PTSD was smaller than in 
healthy survivors.
In all survivors, the volumes of pos-
terior corpus callosum were negatively 
correlated with total CAPS scores (r 
= 20.210; P = .013). The total CAPS 
scores of patients with PTSD were 
from the healthy stressed control par-
ticipants, average data from the regions 
were extracted in each participant to 
examine correlations between mor-
phometric measures with CAPS total 
scores by using age, sex, years of edu-
cation, time since the earthquake, and 
intracranial volume as covariates. The 
Bonferroni method was used to correct 
for multiple comparisons, and a P value 
of less than .025 indicated statistical 
significance in the correlation analyses.
Results
Demographic and clinical characteris-
tics of the 67 patients with PTSD and 
78 healthy survivors are summarized in 
Table 1. The two groups were matched 
in age, sex distribution, or years of edu-
cation. Time from the earthquake until 
MR imaging, which ranged from 7 to 
15 months, did not differ between the 
two groups. No participants received 
psychopharmacologic treatment or psy-
chologic intervention for psychologic 
distress related to the earthquake be-
fore they underwent MR imaging.
No significant difference in intracra-
nial volume was found between the pa-
tients with PTSD and healthy survivors. 
The cortical thickness analysis identified 
two clusters of increased cortical thick-
ness in the group with PTSD compared 
with healthy survivors (P , .05; Monte 
Carlo null-z simulation corrected). One

by Lyoo et al experienced a relatively 
specific and time-limited traumatic expo-
sure caused by a disaster event, and both 
studies compared patients with PTSD 
with a control group of participants who 
had experienced a similar traumatic ex-
posure history. Moreover, Lyoo et al re-
ported that the increased cortical thick-
ness in patients with PTSD returned to 
normal after treatment, which suggests 
that the changes we observed may also 
represent an early manifestation of ill-
ness that could diminish with treatment. 
We conclude from these observations 
that the brain structural changes in PTSD 
may not progress immediately toward 
an atrophic pattern, but instead that in-
creased cortical thicknesses may occur in 
some brain regions in the early stage of 
PTSD, while atrophic changes occur over 
a chronic course of illness.
which this circuitry functions. Taken 
together, these findings demonstrate 
a specific pattern of increased cortical 
thickness in posterior brain regions, 
and the alterations in precuneus were 
related to white matter reductions in 
the corpus callosum region through 
which it sends and receives interhemi-
spheric projections in those who devel-
oped PTSD.
The observed pattern of increased 
cortical thickness differs from some pre-
vious studies that reported decreased 
thickness in PTSD. Most previous stud-
ies that demonstrated thickness decrease 
were performed on patients with chronic 
PTSD with the time from traumatic 
events as long as 12.4 years (3). Similar 
to Lyoo et al (7), our study demonstrated 
a cortical thickness increase in PTSD. 
Participants in our study and in the study 
with potential consequences for cogni-
tive and emotional processes altered in 
PTSD. Second, because left precuneus 
is well known to be important in visual 
processing and was identified (12) as 
a region more active in patients with 
PTSD relative to healthy control pa-
tients in explicit memory tasks, we pos-
tulate that changes in precuneus may 
comprise a neural alteration related to 
visual flashback symptoms in PTSD. 
This correlation between its anatomic 
change and PTSD symptoms implies 
that the findings are clinically relevant. 
Third, the pattern of findings in precu-
neus, posterior superior temporal gy-
rus, and inferior parietal lobule is also 
of interest because all of these regions 
belong to the default mode network, 
and the posterior part of corpus callo-
sum is an important pathway through

precuneus, and second row shows the cluster located in right superior temporal gyrus extending to the inferior parietal lobule. Scatter plots show the averaged

study perhaps represent a neural ba-
sis for increased functional connectiv-
ity in the default mode network. More 
interestingly, cortex thickness changes 
seem to manifest with some laterali-
zation; no regions were found to be 
altered bilaterally. However, past re-
search on gray matter volume changes 
in PTSD lack clear consistent evidence 
of lateralization (17), thus more re-
search on the early phases of illness in 
PTSD is needed to clarify the alteration 
of cortex regions across hemispheres 
and the consistency and consequences 
of lateralized abnormalities.
It is important to highlight that 
volumetric changes of hippocampus 
and amygdala were not observed in 
our current study. This is different 
than some earlier studies (18,19) 
performed primarily in patients with 
chronic PTSD who were exposed to 
repeated traumatic events over a long 
period, such as war veterans. In pa-
tients with PTSD who were recently 
exposed to acute trauma, these re-
sults were less frequently observed 
(20–22), and Chao et al (23) reported 
that hippocampal volume is inversely 
related to PTSD duration. Thus, at 
least with regard to the hippocampus, 
our negative findings in early-course 
patients with PTSD may suggest that 
atrophic changes in that region may 
emerge more gradually over the course 
of illness rather than representing an 
early or primary factor related to ill-
ness onset. Regarding amygdala vol-
umes, alterations in PTSD were not 
commonly observed. Meta-analysis 
of both region of interest (24) and 
whole-brain voxel-based (2) studies 
failed to confirm the presence of sig-
nificant differences in amygdala vol-
umes between our adult patients with 
PTSD and similarly stressed healthy 
comparison participants.
In future studies, it may be prom-
ising to explore the cellular basis for 
increased cortical thickness, which, to 
our knowledge, has not yet been de-
lineated in stress-related disorders. 
For example, we found change in pre-
cuneus, but we cannot be certain why 
precuneus is particularly vulnerable. 
Currently, the following mechanisms 
the internal mental activities and ex-
ternal tasks (13). Alterations in default 
mode network functions in PTSD had 
been found to correlate with early-
life trauma (14) and PTSD symptoms 
(15). One recent study (16) showed 
that acute stress shifts the brain into a 
state that fosters rapid defense mech-
anisms seen in increased intercon-

inferotemporal and temporoparietal 
regions. Thus, our findings comple-
ment existing literature by indicating a 
potential structural basis for dysfunc-
tion of the default mode network, and 
the increased cortical thickness and 
white matter alterations found in our 
The pattern of findings in precu-
neus, posterior superior temporal gy-
rus, and inferior parietal lobule is also 
of interest because all of these regions 
belong to the default mode network, 
and the posterior part of corpus callo-
sum is an important pathway through 
which this circuitry functions. To our 
knowledge, the finding of the struc-
tural alterations in the default mode 
network in PTSD has not previously 
been established in the literature. De-
fault mode network is engaged in the 
maintenance of baseline brain activ-
ity related to cognitive processes of 
self-awareness, episodic memory, and 
the interactive modulation between

greater cortical thickness in default-
mode network regions including pre-
cuneus, superior temporal gyrus, and 
inferior parietal lobule relative to disas-
ter survivors without PTSD who were 
the control participants. This alteration 
was accompanied by volume reduction 
of white matter fibers in the corpus 
callosum subregion that provides inter-
hemispheric connections for these brain 
regions. We demonstrated a potential 
structural neural basis of default mode 
network alterations in patients with 
PTSD, and we also demonstrated that 
the alterations were related to clinical 
symptom severity. These observations 
advance 
mechanistic 
understanding 
of early brain changes that determine 
whether severe emotional trauma will 
lead to PTSD. This may have important 
potential clinical value in the future for 
identification of individuals who experi-
enced a devastating event and are likely 
to develop persistent PTSD.

This study has limitations. First, as 
a cross-sectional study of patients af-
ter onset of PTSD, our results cannot 
clarify whether the cortical alteration 
pattern we found in the early stage of 
PTSD was definitively related to disease 
onset rather than to previous risk fac-
tors for the disorder. Second, given the 
homogeneous nature of stress in our 
study, it is not clear that our findings 
will generalize to PTSD with heteroge-
neous and longer duration stressors. 
Third, although our findings relative to 
the literature suggest that the earlier 
changes in brain anatomy are different 
from those of chronic PTSD, longitudi-
nal studies that follow patients through 
their course of illness are needed to 
confirm that hypothesis.
In summary, our study demon-
strated that untreated disaster survi-
vors early in the course of PTSD had 
merit consideration: an increase in 
the number of neurons or neuropil via 
exuberant arborization; an increased 
number of glial cells, greater volume 
per glial cell, and increased vasculariza-
tion related to increased neural activity 
associated with recurrent visualization 
of the trauma; and an immune or neu-
roendocrine-mediated 
inflammatory 
effect. The possibility that increased 
cortical thickness may be related to an 
inflammatory response is of particular 
interest because neuroinflamation was 
suggested (25) to have an important 
role in the pathogenesis of PTSD. In the 
early stage of inflammation, astrocytes, 
which constitute 90% cortical tissue 
volume, can be activated by proinflam-
matory cytokines, such as interleukin-
1b, and can then induce astrocyte pro-
liferation (26), which could lead to a 
cortical thickness increase.
