IMPORTANCE Time to surgery (TTS) is of concern to patients and clinicians, but controversy
surrounds its effect on breast cancer survival. There remains little national data evaluating the
association.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between the time from diagnosis to breast cancer
surgery and survival, using separate analyses of 2 of the largest cancer databases in the
United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Two independent population-based studies were
conducted of prospectively collected national data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results (SEER)-Medicare–linked database and the National Cancer Database (NCDB). The
SEER-Medicare cohort included Medicare patients older than 65 years, and the NCDB cohort
included patients cared for at Commission on Cancer–accredited facilities throughout the
United States. Each analysis assessed overall survival as a function of time between diagnosis
and surgery by evaluating 5 intervals (�30, 31-60, 61-90, 91-120, and 121-180 days) and
disease-specific survival at 60-day intervals. All patients were diagnosed with
noninflammatory, nonmetastatic, invasive breast cancer and underwent surgery as initial
treatment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Overall and disease-specific survival as a function of time
between diagnosis and surgery, after adjusting for patient, demographic, and tumor-related
factors.
RESULTS The SEER-Medicare cohort had 94 544 patients 66 years or older diagnosed
between 1992 and 2009. With each interval of delay increase, overall survival was lower
overall (hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; 95% CI, 1.06-1.13; P < .001), and in patients with stage I (HR,
1.13; 95% CI, 1.08-1.18; P < .001) and stage II disease (HR 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11; P = .01). Breast
cancer–specific mortality increased with each 60-day interval (subdistribution hazard ratio
[sHR], 1.26; 95% CI, 1.02-1.54; P = .03). The NCDB study evaluated 115 790 patients 18 years
or older diagnosed between 2003 and 2005. The overall mortality HR was 1.10 (95% CI,
1.07-1.13; P < .001) for each increasing interval, significant in stages I (HR, 1.16; 95% CI,
1.12-1.21; P < .001) and II (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05-1.13; P < .001) only, after adjusting for
demographic, tumor, and treatment factors.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Greater TTS is associated with lower overall and
disease-specific survival, and a shortened delay is associated with benefits comparable to
some standard therapies. Although time is required for preoperative evaluation and
consideration of options such as reconstruction, efforts to reduce TTS should be pursued
when possible to enhance survival.

D
elaysinthetreatmentofbreastcancerhavebeenfeared
for decades, as even William Halsted proclaimed in
1907 that “we no longer need the proof…[that] the
slightest delay is dangerous…in the early stage of breast
cancer.
”1 There is little doubt that waiting for treatment causes
anxiety, but the published medical literature has not pro-
vided a consistent answer as to whether any specific preop-
erative time to surgery (TTS) is associated with an effect on
overall or disease-specific survival.
There has been a movement to include TTS as a breast can-
cer quality measure,2-4 but only recently has this preopera-
tive interval and the relationship of patient evaluation com-
ponents to delay been comprehensively evaluated in Medicare
patients.5 We have found that while the interval between pre-
sentation and surgery in Medicare patients is short, that time
interval has been rising, from 21 days in 1992 to 32 days in
2005.5
This report details 2 separate studies undertaken to evalu-
ate the relationship between TTS and survival using 2 of the
largest data sets in existence for the United States popula-
tion: the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-
Medicare–linked database and the National Cancer Database
(NCDB). If breast cancer survival is a function of the time be-
tween diagnosis and surgery, efforts to expedite care may be
of value because of the outcome benefit that occurs.
Methods
The SEER-Medicare and NCDB analyses were each approved
by,andtheneedforinformedconsentwaivedby,theFoxChase
CancerCenterinstitutionalreviewboard.Permissiontousethe
SEER-Medicare and NCDB datasets were obtained, respec-
tively, from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and American
College of Surgeons. The data and analyses were kept sepa-
rate, and no attempts were made to compare data between co-
horts nor to determine whether patients overlapped, for pri-
vacy reasons and to comply with NCI requirements. Both
analyses are presented here because of the representative-
ness of each cohort and the consistent findings. No statistical
analysis between the cohorts has been attempted, nor is one
warranted because the populations, variable definitions, and
ranges differ.
Time intervals between diagnosis and surgery were set at
30-day increments, with the last 2 intervals combined owing
to smaller numbers in each. Intervals to assess overall sur-
vival(OS)werethuscategorizedas30daysorless,31to60days,
61to90days,91to120days,and121to180days,whiledisease-
specific survival (DSS) intervals were characterized as 60 days
or less, 61 to 120 days, and 121 to 180 days because of the lower
rate of cancer-specific events and to minimize estimator vari-
ance. Time from diagnosis was used for OS and DSS so that pa-
tients would have a uniform starting time.
Race/ethnicity was included in the analysis to make the
results more generalizable to the US population. Propensity
score–based weighting, to adjust for confounding, was used
to adjust for covariate differences in the time-interval groups.6
We used multinomial logistic regression to estimate the pro-
pensity scores, stabilized them to improve covariate balance,7
and used restricted cubic splines for continuous covariates.8
We created adjusted OS curves and adjusted cause-specific cu-
mulative incidence functions using the inverse probability
weightmethod.9Coxproportionalhazardsregressionwithpro-
pensity score–based weights were used to estimate the haz-
ardratios(HRs)associatedwiththetimeintervalgroupingsand
OS. Fine and Gray10 proportional hazards regression with pro-
pensity score–based weights was used to estimate the subdis-
tribution hazard ratios (sHRs) associated with the interval
length and breast cancer–specific mortality. We used boot-
strap standard errors for hypothesis testing and 95% confi-
dence intervals; the bootstrap method accounted for propen-
sity score estimation. Differences in the effect of preoperative
time interval by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)
stage were examined via propensity score–based weighted re-
gressions in which we included main effect terms for stage (2
dummyindicators),thepreoperativetimeintervalvariable(or-
dinal variable), and interactions of AJCC stage indicators with
that interval length.
SEER-Medicare Database
SEER-Medicare patients were diagnosed between 1992 and
2009 with invasive, noninflammatory, nonmetastatic breast
cancer. They had surgery as first therapy and a definitive sur-
gery date in Medicare claims of 180 days or less after diagno-
sis. Exclusions included those having missing covariate data
and those younger than 66 years to permit comorbidity as-
sessment 12 months prior to diagnosis. Although patients were
restricted to their first breast cancer occurrence, a history of
other malignant neoplasms was permitted. While substage (ie,
IIA, IIB) migration between AJCC editions can occur in nearly
20% of patients, stage migration occurs in less than 0.2%,11 so
substageswerecollapsedandnotdifferentiatedbyedition.The
diagnosisdate,usedasthepreoperativeintervalstartdate,was
determined by using SEER clinical diagnosis date (which only
consists of a month and year) and searching for the first bi-
opsy date during that month or the subsequent month. Pa-
tients were excluded who had no such discernable biopsy date.
At a Glance
•This study was performed to determine if time from diagnosis to
surgery correlated with overall survival (OS) and disease-specific
survival (DSS) in 2 large national data sets.
•Longer time from diagnosis to breast cancer surgery was
associated with a decline in OS and DSS, when adjusting for
patient, tumor, and treatment factors.
•Overall survival declined for each interval increase in the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare
cohort (hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; P < .001) and the National Cancer
Database cohort (HR, 1.10; P < .001), with the decline most
pronounced in stages I and II disease.
•Disease-specific survival declined for each interval increase in the
SEER-Medicare cohort (HR 1.26, P = .03), with the decline most
pronounced in stage I disease.
•Efforts should be made to reduce the time to surgery when
possible to enhance overall and breast cancer–specific survival.

Because procedure codes for excisional biopsy and seg-
mental mastectomy are sometimes used interchangeably in
billing, inference of therapeutic intent was achieved by defin-
ing a patient’
s definitive surgery as the first date on which
claims for both 1 or more breast excisions or mastectomy and
a lymph node procedure were performed (eTable 1 in the
Supplement).
Adjustments were made for age, sex, race, marital status,
income, education, size of metropolitan area, geographical re-
gion, year of diagnosis, sequence of breast cancer (within a his-
tory of other cancers), Charlson12 and Elixhauser13 comorbid-
ity scores, histologic findings, grade, tumor size, number of
lymphnodesexamined,numberofpositivelymphnodes,AJCC
stage, surgery type, chemotherapy use, and radiotherapy use,
via propensity score–based weighting. Patients receiving neo-
adjuvantchemotherapywereexcluded,andchemotherapyand
radiotherapy use were defined as being administered if given
1yearorlessaftersurgery.RacewasdeterminedfromtheMedi-
care enrollment database variable, while comorbidity, sur-
gery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy came from Medicare
claims. Missing covariate data are listed in eTable 2 in the
Supplement.
National Cancer Database
TheNCDB14cohortincludedpatientshavingnoninflammatory,
invasive, nonmetastatic breast cancer. They had surgical treat-
ment as their first treatment 6 months or less after their diag-
nosisdate.Patientswereincludedifbreastcancerwastheirfirst
andonlymalignantneoplasmandifdiagnosisandtreatment(all

der was unknown were excluded. The NCDB does not provide
adiagnosisdatebutafter2002recordedthelengthoftheinter-
valbetweendiagnosisandsurgery.Thisintervallengthwaspres-
ent for cases diagnosed from 2003 onward. The NCDB requires
follow-up of greater than 5 years, so the cohort only included
cases from 2003 to 2005 with follow-up through 2010.
The NCDB contains the most extensive surgery (eg, a
lumpectomy followed by mastectomy lists the patient as hav-
ing a mastectomy). The NCDB also contains interval lengths
from diagnosis to first surgery and from diagnosis to defini-
tive surgery, to determine if the patient underwent more than
1 procedure. We excluded patients with more than 1 breast pro-
cedure to ensure capture of therapeutic surgery and to elimi-
nate possible confounding excisional biopsies, ensuring that
the analysis evaluated the time to therapeutic surgery. Pa-
tientsreceivingneoadjuvantchemotherapywereexcluded,and
chemotherapy and radiotherapy use were defined as being ad-
ministered if given 1 year or less after surgery. Missing covar-
iate data are listed in eTable 2 in the Supplement.
Adjustments were made for age, sex, race, income, edu-
cation, size of metropolitan area, geographical region, year of
diagnosis, Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score, histologic find-
ings, grade, tumor size, surgical margins, number of nodes ex-
amined, number of positive nodes, AJCC stage, surgery type,
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, facility type,
distance to facility, class of case, and insurance type, via pro-
pensity score–based weighting.
Results
SEER-Medicare Database
There were 94 544 SEER-Medicare patients analyzed, after
all exclusions (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Mean (SD) age
was 75.2 (6.2) years, and 99% were women. Individuals hav-
ing 30 days or less, 31 to 60 days, 61 to 90 days, 91 to 120
days, and 121 to 180 days between diagnosis and surgery
made up 77.7%, 18.3%, 2.7%, 0.7%, and 0.5% of the total
number of patients, respectively; patient and tumor charac-
teristics of these groups are listed in Table 1, demonstrating
greater similarity among the groups after adjustment. Black
race and Hispanic ethnicity, lobular histologic findings, fewer
nodes examined, large metropolitan region, higher Charlson
and Elixhauser comorbidity scores, tumor size, the propor-
tion of stage III tumors, the percentage of patients undergo-
ing mastectomy, and a lack of chemotherapy use increased
steadily in the unadjusted data with an increase in the delay
interval (Table 1).
The increase in mortality in all stages for all patients and
from all causes was 9% (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.06-1.13; P < .001)
for each preoperative interval category increase (Figure 1A).
The TTS was statistically significant with respect to OS in stage
I (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.08-1.18; P < .001) and stage II disease (HR,
1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11; P = .01), but not in stage III (HR, 1.06;
95% CI, 0.97-1.16; P = .17) (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). The
P values for HR interaction for stage I vs stage II was P = .048;
stage I vs III, P = 0.21; and stage II vs III, P = .95.
Added risk of death due to breast cancer for each 60-day
increase in TTS had a subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR] of 1.26
(95% CI, 1.02-1.54; P = .03) (Figure 2). The association with dis-
ease-specific mortality was significant for stage I disease (sHR,
1.84; 95% CI, 1.10-3.07; P = .02) but not for stage II or stage III.
The P values for sHR interaction were P = .04 for stage I vs II
and P = .06 for stage I vs III. Adjusted 5-year OS is listed in
Table 2, and 62.6% of patients were diagnosed before 2005,
allowing for at least 5 years of mortality follow-up. The HRs
and sHRs from the Cox and Fine and Gray models are listed in
eTable 3 in the Supplement. Cardiac and cerebrovascular dis-
ease, along with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were
the most frequent nononcologic specified causes of death
(eTable 4 in the Supplement).
National Cancer Database
There were 115 790 NCDB patients analyzed, after all exclu-
sions (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). The NCDB patient char-
acteristics are summarized with adjusted and unadjusted
data by preoperative interval group in Table 3 and eTable 5
in the Supplement, demonstrating greater similarity among
the groups after adjustment. Mean (SD) patient age was 60.3
(13.4) years, and ages ranged from 18 to 90 years; nearly all
were women. Patients who had intervals of 30 days or less,
31 to 60 days, 61 to 90 days, 91 to 120 days, and 121 to 180
days accounted for 69.5%, 24.9%, 4.1%, 1.0%, and 0.5% of
the total number of patients, respectively. Unadjusted preva-

Discussion
Although the relationship between TTS and breast cancer out-
comes might be assumed to be a modern health care concern,
admonition about breast cancer treatment delays first oc-
curred over 100 years ago1 with TTS at that time measured in
months rather than days or weeks.15 Until recently, there have
beenlittledataaboutwaitingtimesintheUnitedStates,5,16and
there remains little consensus about the relationship be-
tween delays and survival.
Although no data set can determine every cause of delay,
especially those on the part of the patient, we have noted that
some factors increase in prevalence as preoperative delays in-
crease. Our research group has previously found that mul-
tiple factors correlate with a longer time to breast cancer
surgery,5 but regardless of the cause, when adjusting for these
and numerous other demographic, tumor, and treatment fac-
tors, we found that delays still independently correlated with
a slightly lower survival rate in both the SEER-Medicare and
NCDB cohorts.
We have found that OS declines when the TTS increases,
with OS affected in stage I and II but not stage III disease. The
dataforDSSaresimilar,withcancer-specificmortalitydataonly
available in the SEER-Medicare dataset, where patients with
stage I cancer exhibited lower survival as TTS increased. This
observation that preoperative delays affected only stage I DSS
and stage I and stage II OS could be due to lower numbers of
patients with higher-stage disease, but we believe that breast
cancer survivability in its earliest stage is more influenced by
the TTS than it is in later stages because baseline mortality is
smaller relative to the effect imposed by a delay in treatment.
In both cohorts, OS and DSS for stage III disease were not in-
fluenced by TTS, suggesting either partial biologic predesti-
nation of outcome or a mortality risk that overshadows any
small effect of reducing delay by a matter of months. This ef-
fect may also be attenuated by patient age owing to compet-
ing mortality risks. Because of this and because final stage is
only available postoperatively, we believe that efforts to mini-
mize preoperative delay for all patients is advisable.
We have adjusted for numerous variables in each study,
but unmeasured confounders could still exist, as with every
series, affecting survival negatively or positively. We ex-
cluded patients having neoadjuvant chemotherapy in these
analyses to maintain cohort homogeneity and because we
found that these patients had a markedly longer TTS because
of the lengthy time imposed by the treatment itself, with lower
survival related to its indications, skewing the data toward the
appearance of artificially worse outcomes with longer delays.
The slight differences we see in the magnitude of effect by de-
layfortheSEER-MedicarevsNCDBcohortmayreflectthecom-
plexities in the relationship between age and tumor biology,17
or age and treatment,18 that cannot be clearly defined in these
data sets. It also must be recognized that the effects seen here
may result from delay to surgery, delay to postoperative
therapy,orboth.Forpatientsforwhomsurgeryisthefirsttreat-
ment before systemic therapy, these possibilities are inextri-
cable, and all underscore the need to avoid undue delay.
The effect of TTS on survival is a ubiquitous concern of pa-
tients with cancer and a question frequently posed in consul-
tations with surgeons. Elimination of undue delay is desir-
able to both reduce anxiety and lower risk, and we believe that
this study provides clinicians needed data to answer pa-
tients’questions about TTS and its effect on outcome. While

the absolute magnitude of the 5-year survival difference was
small (4.6% and 3.1% for ≤30 days vs 91-120 days in SEER-
MedicareandNCDBpatients,respectively),thisbenefitiscom-
parable to the addition of some standard therapies, such as the
recent extension of tamoxifen therapy from 5 to 10 years,19
while not having the adverse effects or costs found with most
interventions.
WhetherTTSshouldberevisitedasaqualitymeasurecould
be debated in light of practical matters that contribute to de-
lay.Someofthesearepatientdriven,suchasthedesireformul-
tipleopinions,limitationsinthepatient’
sschedule,ornotseek-
ing care as instructed. Some may be system driven, such as a
lack of available operating room time, appointment times, in-
surance issues, and barriers to care. Yet others may be physi-
cian related, such as schedule limitations or excessive use of
imaging or other testing. The National Quality Forum, Na-
tional Comprehensive Cancer Network, and American Soci-
ety of Clinical Oncology have already ratified at least 3 time-
dependent breast cancer measures.20 These include receipt of
tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor within 1 year of diagno-
sis, initiation of breast radiotherapy within 1 year of diagno-
sis, and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy within 4 months of
diagnosis.
Questions remain as to whether time-dependent mea-
sures improve the quality of care,21 but there has already been
consideration of TTS as a quality measure.2-4 The previous lack
of clear data has weakened the need for such a standard, but
our findings here suggest that a reasonable delay threshold
might be appropriate for oncologic surgery, as it has been for
medical oncology and radiation oncology. Because only 1.2%
and 1.5% of the SEER-Medicare and NCDB patients, respec-
tively, had a TTS that was over 90 days, providing these few
patients with breast cancer the 3% to 5% survival benefit as-
sociated with reduced delay also seems achievable.
Unfortunately, prior studies on survival and delay have
been inconclusive. While some suggest that these factors are
linked,22-24 others have found no correlation.25-27 Many se-
lect an arbitrary single-interval cutoff at which delay is
defined.23,24,26 In our 2 series, the cohort sizes provided power
beyond that achieved by prior analyses and allowed for analy-
sis of multiple delay groups of varying lengths while adjust-
ing for numerous confounders to clarify the relationship. The
similar results between separate analyses of these 2 large na-
tional data sets, having different characteristics, is also com-
pelling and suggests that the effect of delay on survival is a true
phenomenon and not one specific to a particular cohort.
Although this report describes 2 population-based series,
a prospective study randomizing patients to varying degrees of
delay is unlikely to occur because of both ethical consider-
ations and aversion to delays in treatment. For this reason, we
believe that these analyses of 2 of the largest prospectively col-
lected data sets in existence for the United States provide the
most definitive demonstration possible. The 15-year estimates
andthe120-to180-dayestimatesshowalargerbenefitofmini-
mizing delay, but these subgroups also have very few individu-
als at risk, limiting the power of even these large analyses.
Conclusions
In conclusion, survival outcomes in early-stage breast cancer
areaffectedbythelengthoftheintervalbetweendiagnosisand
surgery, and efforts to minimize that interval are appropri-
ate. Although the effect on both overall and disease-specific
survival remains small, consideration should be given to es-
tablishing reasonable and attainable goals for the timing of sur-
gical interventions to afford this population a finite, but clini-
cally relevant, survival benefit.
