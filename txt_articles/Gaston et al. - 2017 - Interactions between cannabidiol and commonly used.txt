SUMMARY
Objective: To identify potential pharmacokinetic interactions between the pharma-
ceutical formulation of cannabidiol (CBD; Epidiolex) and the commonly used
antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) through an open-label safety study. Serum levels were
monitored to identify interactions between CBD and AEDs.
Methods: In 39 adults and 42 children, CBD dose was started at 5 mg/kg/day and
increased every 2 weeks by 5 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 50 mg/kg/day. Serum
AED levels were obtained at baseline prior to CBD initiation and at most study visits.
AED doses were adjusted if it was determined that a clinical symptom or laboratory
result was related to a potential interaction. The Mixed Procedure was used to deter-
mine if there was a significant change in the serum level of each of the 19 AEDs with
increasing CBD dose. AEDs with interactions seen in initial analysis were plotted for
mean change in serum level over time. Subanalyses were performed to determine if
the frequency of sedation in participants was related to the mean serum N-desmethyl-
clobazam level, and if aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) levels were different in participants taking concomitant valproate.
Results: Increases in topiramate, rufinamide, and N-desmethylclobazam and decrease
in clobazam (all p < 0.01) serum levels were seen with increasing CBD dose. Increases in
serum levels of zonisamide (p = 0.02) and eslicarbazepine (p = 0.04) with increasing
CBD dose were seen in adults. Except for clobazam and desmethylclobazam, all noted
mean level changes were within the accepted therapeutic range. Sedation was more fre-
quent with higher N-desmethylclobazam levels in adults (p = 0.02), and AST/ALT levels
were significantly higher in participants taking concomitant valproate (p < 0.01).
Significance: Significantly changed serum levels of clobazam, rufinamide, topiramate,
zonisamide, and eslicarbazepine were seen. Abnormal liver function test results were
noted in participants taking concomitant valproate. This study emphasizes the impor-
tance of monitoring serum AED levels and LFTs during treatment with CBD.

For millennia, there has been great interest in the use of
cannabis and its derivatives in the treatment of various med-
ical
and
neurologic
problems,
including
epilepsy.1,2
Cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid compound derived
from the cannabis plant, is of particular interest as a poten-
tial anticonvulsant due to the reported lack of psychoactive
effects compared to those seen in tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC). CBD has long been known to be effective in animal
models of epilepsy.3–7 However, until recently, few data
were available regarding its safety and efficacy in humans.

FULL-LENGTH ORIGINAL RESEARCH
 Recent placebo-controlled studies indicate that CBD may
be effective for the treatment of difficult-to-control epilep-
sies including Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes.8–10
These experimental data are supported by observational
data from class IV open-label compassionate-use CBD
state-sponsored expanded-access programs, such as the one
in Alabama recognized under the name “Carly’s Law.”11–13
CBD
modulates
several
cytochrome
P450
(CYP)
enzymes, which are of potential interest in investigating
interactions with other medications. It is a potent inhibitor
of CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9 and a potential inhibi-
tor of the CYP3 family.14–20 Based on what is known about
CBD’s metabolism and the metabolism of other antiepilep-
tic drugs (AEDs), one could speculate that there could be
many interactions given the pervasive involvement of these
CYP enzymes in the metabolism of AEDs.21,22 To date,
there are few data on CBD’s interactions with other AEDs.
An animal study using maximal electric shock and audio-
genic seizure models showed that CBD potentiated the anti-
convulsant effects of phenytoin by twofold, and modestly
potentiated the effect of phenobarbital; CBD also reduced
the anticonvulsant properties of chlordiazepoxide, clon-
azepam, and ethosuximide.23 These results were thought to
be due to CBD’s actions on the CYP system, although these
specific actions were not known at the time. A recently pub-
lished article revealed a clear drug–drug interaction
between CBD and clobazam in a group of 13 pediatric
patients. Clobazam and, to a greater extent, N-desmethyl-
clobazam (the active metabolite of clobazam) levels
increased in response to increasing doses of CBD.24 Interac-
tions with other AEDs have not been investigated to date.
The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) CBD
open-label compassionate-use study is investigating CBD
as a potential add-on therapy for the treatment of treatment-
resistant epilepsy in children and adults. All the enrolled
patients were taking multiple concomitant AEDs. As part of
the study, frequent monitoring of serum AED levels was
performed to identify potential interactions, changes in drug
levels, and possible clinically significant relationships
between drug level changes and any observed adverse
events. Given what is known about CBD’s mechanism of
action and metabolism, it was suspected that other AEDs
with metabolism hinging on similar enzymes would be
affected. The purpose of this study was to identify which
AEDs potentially interact with CBD based on serum drug
level changes, and in turn, if these potential interactions
were clinically meaningful. Based on recently published
studies and the known CBD metabolic pathways, we
hypothesized that as the dose of CBD increased, the levels
of
clobazam
and
N-desmethylclobazam
would
increase.20,24,25 This potential interaction was hypothesized
to contribute to a significant increase in reported excessive
sedation in participants taking CBD. Based on observations
during the study, we hypothesized that participants taking
concomitant valproate with CBD would have a higher inci-
dence of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) abnormalities compared to partici-
pants not taking valproate. We also hypothesized that there
are interactions with other AEDs given CBD’s known
action on key CYP enzymes, and thus we examined data on
all AEDs used in the study by the enrolled participants.
Methods
The UAB CBD program conducts a prospective compas-
sionate-use open-label study in patients with treatment-resis-
tant epilepsy. “Treatment resistant” was defined as failing to
respond to a total of four or more AEDs at adequate dose,
including at least one trial of two concomitant AEDs. Other
inclusion criteria include age >1 year, stable neurostimulator
settings, and ketogenic diet ratio for ≥3 months if applicable,
documentation of a detailed seizure diary 3 months prior to
enrollment, and current Alabama residency. Exclusion crite-
ria include history of substance abuse or addiction, use of
medical marijuana or CBD-based product within the last
30 days, history of allergies to CBD or marijuana products or
to sesame, felbamate therapy initiation within the last
12 months, AST or ALT elevation ≥5 times upper limit of
normal, hemoglobin <10, hematocrit <30, or white blood cell
count <2,000, among others (all inclusion and exclusion cri-
teria are available at www.uab.edu/cbd). Of importance for
these analyses is that all participants must have been taking a
stable dose of all AEDs for at least 1 month before they could
be considered for enrollment. In addition, baseline plasma
levels of all AEDs were obtained prior to enrollment.
All participants were seen and evaluated in a devoted
research clinic that was held weekly for both adult and
pediatric arms of the study. Each potential participant in
the study must have a packet submitted on their behalf by
their primary neurologist, and all study packets were
reviewed by a study approval committee before a partici-
pant was enrolled, with second verification by the study
principal investigators. At the time of the enrollment visit,
all participants and/or their legal representatives signed the
consent form that was approved by the University of Ala-
bama at Birmingham Institutional Review Board. The
study is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
Key Points

CBD Interactions with AEDs
 approved and registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov under
the
numbers
NCT02695537
(pediatric
arm)
and
NCT02700412 (adult arm).
Upon approval for enrollment, participants were seen in
the clinic every 2 weeks during active titration of the CBD
dose, with less frequent appointments when doses were not
adjusted. All participants received the active study drug.
Epidiolex is formulated in sesame oil and administered
orally.26 Participants were weighed at every clinic visit. All
participants were started on a dose of 5 mg/kg/day split
between a.m. and p.m.; participants were instructed to take
the CBD at the same time they administer their other AEDs
dosed twice daily (although this was not strictly monitored).
At each follow-up clinic visit, the dose could be titrated in
5 mg/kg/day increments to a maximum dose of 50 mg/kg/
day. Dose adjustments were based on participants’ response
to treatment and tolerability. The dose could be decreased
over the phone between clinic visits if there are reports of
worsening seizures or side effects, but dose increases were
made in person only. Study visit interval was extended once
a participant had reached a stable dose of CBD for greater
than 2 visits.
At each clinic visit, participants received a full physical
examination including neurologic examination and labora-
tory testing, and their seizure diary and side effect profiles
were reviewed. Laboratory testing included complete blood
count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, and
serum AED levels, which were obtained at almost all clinic
visits; blood for labs was drawn between 11:00 a.m. and
3:00 p.m. Not all blood samples were collected at trough;
therefore, some blood levels were not trough concentrations.
Investigators had the authority to adjust the dose of other
AEDs if their clinical impression was that a reported adverse
event is related to the AED itself or a suspected interaction
between that AED and CBD—this follows the design of a
naturalistic follow-up study.27,28 In some cases, particularly
with valproate and clobazam, AEDs were weaned and ulti-
mately discontinued due to reports of certain adverse events,
notably sedation and elevation of liver function test results.
This analysis encompasses the first year of data collec-
tion. AED levels from 39 adults and 42 children were avail-
able for analyses. Prior to enrollment, baseline drug levels
were obtained by the referring physician and analyzed
locally or by designated reference laboratories. Blood sam-
ples for drug levels during the study were all drawn in the
UAB Kirklin Clinic or Children’s Hospital of Alabama
(COA) laboratory and were analyzed either by the UAB or
COA laboratory or reference laboratories, as necessary; if
reference laboratories were utilized, the same service was
used each time a specific test was obtained. For example,
testing of clobazam and desmethylclobazam was always
conducted by Mayo Clinic. All testing was performed in
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-
certified
laboratories
(www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-
Guidance/Legislation/CLIA/).
In addition to the baseline AED levels obtained before
study enrollment, each visit in which AED levels were
obtained was considered a data point. Each data point was
associated with a corresponding CBD dose. Using a mixed
linear model (the Mixed Procedure), the data points associ-
ated with each AED were analyzed to investigate if the
plasma levels of each AED changed significantly with
increasing CBD dose. In this analysis, absolute changes in
serum levels were investigated only; there was no threshold
set for each drug to determine clinical significance. To fur-
ther quantify the degree of change in AED levels on CBD
and to account for the noise in the data related to the natural-
istic study design, the baseline and first two recorded AED
levels were plotted by the mean change in level between
measurements (CBD dose was not accounted for in this
analysis). Separate subanalyses were performed to deter-
mine if there was a significant increase in reported sedation
in participants who were taking concomitant clobazam, and
if there was a significant increase in AST and ALT levels in
participants who were taking concomitant valproate com-
pared to baseline liver function test values obtained at study
entry. These adverse events did not occur frequently with
the other AEDs, and thus due to lack of clinical suspicion,
these subanalyses were performed only on participants tak-
ing clobazam and valproate.
Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the partici-
pants are included in Table 1. Data were analyzed within
individual adult and pediatric arms and combined. In some
cases, data for a specific AED could be analyzed only within
one arm due to insufficient data points for analysis in the

 other arm (carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine, ezogabine, and
pregabalin in children, and ethosuximide and vigabatrin in
adults). However, in several cases there were >100 data
points analyzed for each AED (Table 1). Analysis via the
Mixed Procedure allowed us to control for nonuniform
changes in both CBD dose and AED doses as allowed in the
naturalistic study design. Linear increases in serum levels of
topiramate (p < 0.001), rufinamide (p = 0.004), and N-des-
methylclobazam (p < 0.001, active metabolite of cloba-
zam),
and
linear
decreases
in
levels
of
clobazam
(p < 0.001) with increasing CBD dose were seen in com-
bined pediatric and adult arms (the decreases in clobazam
level were concurrent to the decreases in dose as directed by
the presence of the adverse effect—sedation). In addition, a
significant
increase
in
serum
levels
of
zonisamide
(p = 0.017) and eslicarbazepine (p = 0.039) with increas-
ing CBD dose was seen in the adult arm only. Of note, there
were no pediatric participants enrolled in the study who
were taking eslicarbazepine at the time of this analysis, and
thus an interaction between CBD and eslicarbazepine could
not be performed in the pediatric arm. There were no signifi-
cant changes in drug levels with CBD dose titration in the
other AEDs analyzed (valproate, levetiracetam, phenobar-
bital, clonazepam, phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine,
oxcarbazepine, ethosuximide, vigabatrin, ezogabine, prega-
balin, perampanel, and lacosamide). Table 2 shows the
results of the analyses for each of the AEDs.
To quantify the degree of change of the AED levels,
while accounting for the noise in the data related to the
naturalistic study design (namely the investigators’ ability
to adjust AED and CBD doses during the study), plots
were generated to show the mean change in the AED level
from the baseline level (off CBD) to the first and second
AED levels obtained while the patients was receiving
CBD in the AEDs identified to have statistically signifi-
cant interaction (Table 2). Two separate plots for the same
AED were generated if the dose of the AED in question
was changed between the measurements (due to elevated
levels or possible side effects; this was always an AED
dose decrease). This analysis was independent of the CBD
dose. There were statistically significant increases in clo-
bazam, N-desmethylclobazam, and eslicarbazepine levels.
However, changes in topiramate, zonisamide, and rufi-
namide levels were not found to be significant in com-
bined arms and within individual pediatric and adult arms
when conducted only for the baseline and first two serum
AED level measurements. These data are presented in
Table 3.
A linear regression model analysis was used to determine
if there was a relationship between mean N-desmethylcloba-
zam levels and the total frequency of sedation for each par-
ticipant. A total of 6 of 12 adults and 8 of 15 children taking
clobazam during the study complained of sedation at least
once during the study, which resulted in a clobazam dose
decrease in all instances (but not discontinuation). There
was a significant effect of mean level of N-desmethylcloba-
zam on the total frequency of sedation (p = 0.019), condi-
tioning on the average dose of CBD for adult arm. However,
the results were not significant with identical analyses in all
study patients and within the pediatric arm.

CBD Interactions with AEDs
 Subanalysis of liver function tests was performed with
t-test and the test of fixed effects. Preliminary analyses in all
patients via t-test revealed that AST and ALT levels were
significantly higher in participants taking concomitant CBD
and valproate compared to participants not taking valproate.
Valproate and CBD were discontinued in 4 of 14 children
due to elevated liver function test results of greater than
three times the upper limit of normal, and valproate only
was discontinued in one of 8 adults due to liver function test
levels approximately two times the upper limit of normal. In
all cases, levels normalized quickly after the aforementioned
medication changes. Mean ALT level in all participants tak-
ing concomitant valproate was 35.3 U/L (normal range 7–
52), versus 23.7 U/L in the participants not taking valproate
(p = 0.026). Mean AST in the participants taking concomi-
tant valproate was 37.1 U/L (normal range 12–39), versus
23.97
U/L
in
the
participants
not
taking
valproate
(p = 0.003). Furthermore, via the test of mixed effects
(mixed model analysis), the effect of valproate on partici-
pants’ AST and ALT levels was analyzed via valproate level
vs. ALT/AST levels and valproate dose vs. ALT/AST levels.
No significant effect of valproate level was seen in AST and
ALT levels. However, there was a significant effect on val-
proate dose on both AST (p = 0.002) and ALT (p = 0.023)
in all patients and within both pediatric and adult arms. Of
note is that although these results were statistically signifi-
cant, they are still within the normal range for both groups.
Discussion
The goal of the study was to evaluate CBD for potential
interactions with AEDs typically used for seizure control in
patients with epilepsy. As such, several statistically signifi-
cant interactions were identified in these analyses. Serum
levels
of
N-desmethylclobazam,
topiramate,
eslicar-
bazepine, zonisamide, and rufinamide increased after CBD
was started.
As described previously,24 our study showed that CBD
has a clinically and statistically significant interaction with
clobazam and its active metabolite N-desmethylclobazam,
resulting in increased sedation in adult participants. This
interaction was noted despite study clinicians decreasing
the clobazam dose (sometimes aggressively) in the presence
of sedation. This aggressive decrease in clobazam dose is
the explanation for the significant decrease in clobazam
level with increasing CBD dose in the Mixed Procedure
analysis. However, when separating those participants
whose clobazam dose was decreased at the time of first two
serum AED levels were obtained, a significant increase in
clobazam levels was seen—levels increased significantly
above the upper limit of normal. The interaction between
CBD and N-desmethylclobazam appears much more pro-
found, though, and this is likely explained by CBD’s potent
inhibition of CYP2C19, which is primarily responsible for
the metabolism of N-desmethylclobazam.29 This pharma-
cokinetic interaction results in effective prolongation of
desmethylclobazam’s half-life, and thus accumulation
resulting in increased levels and increased incidence of
sedation. The dosing of clobazam may need to be adjusted
when starting CBD in anticipation of the increase of
desmethylclobazam level and associated increases in the
incidence of sedation. Of additional interest is the finding
that our analysis did not reveal a significant interaction
between CBD and clonazepam. Although clobazam and

AED levels that were identified to have statistically significant changes in the presence of CBD were further analyzed to determine the degree in change of AED
level over time from pre-CBD baseline to the first two blood levels after the initiation of CBD. Due to the naturalistic study design, CBD dose was not accounted
for in this analysis. AEDs marked with an asterisk (clobazam p = 0.030, desmethylclobazam p < 0.001, and eslicarbazepine p = 0.008, marked witha) showed a sta-
tistically significant increase in mean level with the presence of CBD between the baseline and presented in the table time point. Discrepancies in number of partici-
pants between Table 2 and here are due to lack of baseline N-desmethylclobazam in one participant, and lack of follow-up rufinamide levels in two participants due
to quick withdrawal from the study.

 clonazepam undergo metabolism via similar pathways, per-
haps the structural differences between the two (clonazepam
being a 1,4-benzodiazepine and clobazam being a 1,5-) may
explain the difference, or a clonazepam metabolite (not
measured in this study) is also increasing in level. However,
this would not be clinically significant as all metabolites of
clonazepam are inactive.30
Other findings were the significant increases in the levels
of topiramate in both pediatric and adult participants and
zonisamide in the adult participants. Topiramate is metabo-
lized by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, whereas zonisamide is
metabolized by CYP3A4 and N-acetyltransferase.22,31–34
CBD has shown inhibitory action on all CYP enzymes
involved in the metabolism of these drugs, which could be
the explanation for the observed interaction. Of additional
interest is the noted interaction between CBD and zon-
isamide in the adult arm only. A pharmacokinetics study34
on zonisamide monotherapy in children showed that plasma
zonisamide levels linearly increased with age. Although this
study included only pediatric participants, these findings
could be extrapolated to adults and may explain our study’s
findings.
We do not have a clear explanation for the other interac-
tions noted in the study between CBD and eslicarbazepine
and rufinamide. Eslicarbazepine is metabolized via glu-
curonidation,35 and rufinamide via carboxyl esterases.36
Perhaps the delivery vehicle (sesame oil) in this formulation
of CBD could be contributing to these interactions. Of note,
sesamin (the major constituent in sesame seeds and oil) is
known to block the activation of the pregnane X receptor
(PXR), which has been shown to regulate CYP3A4, glu-
tathione
S-transferases,
sulfotransferases,
and
uridine
diphosphate-glucoronyltransferases, which may play a role
in our observed interactions.37
An interaction was noted in those participants taking con-
comitant valproate and CBD with regard to elevated liver
function test results. This observation was made despite
there not being a significant change in the valproate levels
with increasing CBD dose. In some cases, valproate dose
was weaned or completely discontinued due to increasing or
abnormally high AST and/or ALT levels after CBD treat-
ment initiation. These abnormalities were not seen in partic-
ipants who were not taking valproate in the study, indicating
that there was an effect of the combined valproate and CBD
on liver functions or that CBD affected the negative effects
of valproate on liver functions. This emphasizes the need
for not only selected drug levels to be monitored during
therapy with CBD, but also for routine liver function test
analysis in those patients who are taking concomitant val-
proate. Of clinical interest, after data collection for these
analyses was complete, the four children whose valproate
and CBD had to be discontinued due to abnormal liver test
results were rechallenged on CBD alone and have not had
recurrence of these abnormalities.
There were several limitations to our analyses. Although
the data presented represent one year’s worth of data collec-
tion, the sample sizes of patients taking each individual
AED were relatively small, which in turn could be masking
other potential interactions with CBD. We believe this was
offset by the large number of data points (observations)
within each subject, as blood levels were collected at almost
every study visit (Table 2). In addition, due to the naturalis-
tic design of the study, there was significant noise in the data
that could not completely be accounted for in our analyses.
To summarize, this study introduces potential pharma-
cokinetic interactions between CBD and other commonly
used AEDs in the treatment of epilepsy. Because CBD con-
tinues to be studied as a potential anticonvulsant, clinicians
and researchers alike should be aware of significant
changes in serum levels of clobazam/desmethylclobazam,
eslicarbazepine, rufinamide, topiramate, and zonisamide.
In addition, although this is part of routine drug monitor-
ing, liver function should be monitored closely in patients
taking concomitant CBD and valproate, as this combina-
tion may result in an increase in both AST and ALT levels.
Going forward, formal pharmacokinetic studies under con-
trolled conditions will be needed to further confirm these
interactions.
