Looking forward to new targeted 
treatments for chronic spontaneous urticaria

Abstract 
The introduction of omalizumab to the management of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) has markedly improved 
the therapeutic possibilities for both, patients and physicians dealing with this disabling disease. But there is still a 
hard core of patients who do not tolerate or benefit from existing therapies and who require effective treatment. 
Novel approaches include the use of currently available drugs off-licence, investigational drugs currently undergoing 
clinical trials and exploring the potential for therapies directed at pathophysiological targets in CSU. Off-licence uses 
of currently available drugs include rituximab and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors. Ligelizumab (anti-IgE), canaki-
numab (anti-IL-1), AZD1981 (a PGD2 receptor antagonist) and GSK 2646264 (a selective Syk inhibitor) are currently in 
clinical trials for CSU. Examples of drugs that could target potential pathophysiological targets in CSU include sub-
stance P antagonists, designed ankyrin repeat proteins, C5a/C5a receptor inhibitors, anti-IL-4, anti-IL-5 and anti-IL-13 
and drugs that target inhibitory mast cell receptors. Other mediators and receptors of likely pathogenic relevance 
should be explored in skin profiling and functional proof of concept studies. The exploration of novel therapeutic 
targets for their role and relevance in CSU should help to achieve a better understanding of its etiopathogenesis.

Background
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as the 
spontaneous appearance of itchy weals, angioedema, or 
both, for at least 6 weeks [1]. It is a self limiting disorder, 
persisting for 2–5 years in the majority of cases, although 
20% of patients suffer for more than 5 years [2]. Beyond 
the visual impact of weals and angioedema, quality of life 
is substantially reduced in patients due to interference 
with sleep, daily activities, social interaction, work pro-
ductivity [3] and emotional well-being [4]. There is also a 
high socioeconomic impact from both the direct (medi-
cation and healthcare visits) and indirect costs (absence 
from or reduced efficiency while at work) [5, 6].
The introduction of omalizumab as an add-on therapy 
to H1 antihistamines as a management option has mark-
edly improved the therapeutic possibilities for both CSU 
patients and physicians dealing with this chronic dis-
ease. Nevertheless, there are still many patients who do 
not tolerate or benefit from existing therapies including 
omalizumab.
This review describes possible future treatment options 
and novel therapeutic targets in CSU based on the patho-
physiology of the disease and summarizes ongoing clini-
cal studies in CSU.
Pathophysiological events in chronic spontaneous 
urticaria
Understanding the pathophysiology of urticaria is impor-
tant for the identification of potential targets for novel 
treatments. Weals and angioedema in CSU result from 
the degranulation of skin mast cells, which release his-
tamine, proteases and cytokines with generation of 
platelet-activating factor and other arachidonic acid 
metabolites (prostaglandin D2, leukotrienes C4, D4 and 
E4). These mediators induce vasodilatation, increase vas-
cular permeability, and stimulate sensory nerve endings 
that lead to swelling, redness and itch [7].

The weal is characterized by dermal oedema, vasodila-
tation and a perivascular mixed infiltrate composed of 
predominantly CD4+ lymphocytes with variable num-
bers of monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils 
similar to allergen-mediated late-phase skin reactions, 
but the cytokine profile is characterized by an increase 
in IL-4, IL-5 and interferon-gamma, which is sugges-
tive of a mixed Th1/Th2 response [8–10]. Cytokines that 
promote a Th2 profile of inflammation [IL-33, IL-25 and 
thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)], are increased in 
lesional but not uninvolved skin [11]. Vascular markers, 
with eosinophil and neutrophil infiltration, are dominant 
in lesional skin, whereas eosinophils and microvascular 
changes persist at uninvolved sites by comparison with 
healthy controls. They may prime the skin for further 
wealing in conjunction with increased mast cell numbers 
[12]. Biopsies from both lesional and nonlesional skin 
of CSU patients show upregulation of soluble media-
tors and adhesion molecules, which is indicative of a 
“widespread immunologic activation” possibly lower-
ing the threshold of mast cell degranulation to trigger-
ing stimuli [13–15]. Some authors suggest that CSU is an 
“immune-mediated inflammatory disorder” that involves 
an immunological activation event following exposure to 
an exogeneous or modified endogeneous trigger (such 
as functional autoantibodies) in the presence of suscep-
tibility factors (e.g. stress, pathogen exposures) [16]. The 
inflammatory cascade in CSU may be modulated by an 
altered chemokine–cytokine network and is attributed 
to immune dysregulation as a consequence of disturbed 
innate and adaptive immunity [15].
The mechanisms by which cutaneous mast cells are 
activated to induce hives in CSU are still not completely 
understood. It is widely accepted that CSU is due to auto-
immune/autoreactive mechanisms in some patients. 
There is considerable evidence for a role and clinical rel-
evance of functional IgG autoantibodies to IgE or to the 
extracellular α subunit of the high affinity IgE receptor 
(FcεRIα) in approximately 30–50% of patients [17, 18]. 
These autoantibodies belong mainly to the complement 
fixing and activating subtypes IgG1 and IgG3. The activa-
tion of complement generates C5a, which interacts with 
the C5a receptor on the surface of skin mast cells and 
induces activation [19].
The stimulus for mast cell activation in the remaining 
50–70% of urticaria patients is less clear. They potentially 
include IgE antibodies against autoallergens, neuropep-
tides such as substance P, alarmins and complement acti-
vation due to chronic infections [20, 21]. The relevance of 
observed coagulation abnormalities on mast cell degran-
ulation is uncertain although a role for thrombin gener-
ated by extrinsic factor activation has been proposed 
[22].
Basophils also appear to be involved in the pathogene-
sis of CSU. Peripheral blood basopenia is seen in patients 
with high disease activity and may be explained by the 
recruitment of basophils from the blood into skinlesions 
[23]. CSU basophils also show functional abnormalities 
during active disease that revert during disease remi-
sion. Greaves was first to show the hyporesponsiveness of 
basophils of patients with CSU to anti-IgE [24]. Reduced 
basophil responsiveness to anti-IgE and altered signal 
transduction are reportedly seen in at least half of the 
patients [24–28]. Vonakis and coworkers reported baso-
phil hypo-responsiveness in about half of the patients 
with chronic urticaria that is linked to excessive activity 
of the negative regulator Src homology inositol phos-
phatase (SHIP). SHIP dephosphorylates kinases such as 
spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and consequently decreases 
cell responsiveness. Reversal of anti-IgE hypo-respon-
siveness was observed upon disease remission, which 
suggests a relationship with the disease pathogenesis 
[28].
The current guidelines for CSU recommend the use of 
non-sedating H1 antihistamines followed by leukotriene 
antagonists (LTRA), ciclosporin and omalizumab as add-
on treatment to antihistamines. Although histamine is 
a major contributor, approximately 40–55% of patients 
are refractory and achieve little or no benefit even from 
updosing antihistamines [29]. Leukotriene inhibitors 
are not superior to placebo or H1 antihistamines and 
should be used in combination with an antihistamine 
[30]. Ciclosporin is often effective, especially in patients 
with a positive basophil histamine release assay [31], but 
some patients do not tolerate treatment or have to be 
discontinued due to adverse events. Ciclosporin is gener-
ally used in short courses but long term treatment with 
low doses has been reported to be safe and effective [32]. 
Omalizumab has provided a substantial advance in the 
treatment of CSU, but not everyone responds, the drug is 
expensive and is not readily available for many patients in 
many countries.
Off‑label use of licensed drugs
Anti‑TNF therapies
TNF-α antagonists have been reported to be effective in 
60% of 20 CSU patients of a retrospective case series [33], 
including some omalizumab non-responders, and TNF-α 
has been reported to be upregulated in patients with CSU 
as compared to healthy controls [34].
Anti‑CD20
Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 has been 
successfully used for the treatment of several autoim-
mune diseases [35]. Treatment of CSU patients with 
rituximab hasbeen reported; it was effective in two case 
 Page 3 of 10
Kocatürk et al. Clin Transl Allergy  (2017) 7:1 
reports with autoimmune urticaria [36, 37], but was inef-
fective in another [38]. There has been a Phase I/II study 
of rituximab in patients with CSU, which was registered 
in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00216762). This study was 
halted by FDA due to safety concerns. Rituximab could 
be an option in very resistant autoimmune urticaria 
cases, but the side effect profile of this drug needs to be 
taken into consideration.
Drugs that are under investigation
Anti‑IgE therapies
Even though omalizumab is highly effective in CSU 
[39–41] and can reduce disease activity in many forms 
of inducible urticarias [42, 43], there are patients who 
do not benefit sufficiently or at all from it. Strategies for 
these patients are evolving and may include off-label 
combinations of omalizumab with current immunosup-
pressive or anti-inflammatory drugs. MEDI-4212, lige-
lizumab (QGE031) and quilizumab are new anti-IgE 
reagents that are currently undergoing phase 2 trials test-
ings [44]. Quilizumab and ligelizumab are under investi-
gation in CSU.
Ligelizumab (QGE031)
Ligelizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody 
that binds with high affinity to the Cε3 domain of IgE. 
Compared to omalizumab, ligelizumab shows six-fold 
to nine-fold greater suppression of allergen-induced 
skin prick tests in vivo. The estimated plasma half-life is 
20 days with over 95% suppression of allergen-induced 
skin prick test responses 6 weeks post dose by compari-
son with 41% for omalizumab. It also provides greater 
and longer suppression of free IgE and IgE on the surface 
of circulating basophils as compared to omalizumab [45]. 
These findings suggest that ligelizumab may be more 
potent than omalizumab in the treatment of CSU. There 
is an ongoing multi-center, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo, and active-controlled phase 2b dose-finding 
study of ligelizumab as add-on therapy to investigate the 
efficacy and safety in patients with CSU (NCT02477332). 
The effects of ligelizumab and omalizumab as control, in 
this trial, are assessed by measurements of wheal num-
bers, itch intensity and the urticaria activity scores at 
baseline, at week 12 and at week 20. The study includes 
four different doses of ligelizumab given as subcutaneous 
injections of omalizumab 300 mg monthly as a positive 
control and a placebo arm. The estimated enrolment is 
360 CSU patients and anticipated study completion date 
is March 2017.
Quilizumab
Quilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that 
targets the M1 prime segment of membrane expressed 
IgE on IgE-switched B cells and plasmablasts. Quili-
zumab is in clinical development for the treatment of 
allergic asthma. By causing the depletion of IgE-switched 
B cells and plasmablasts, it reduces serum IgE levels [46]. 
These findings suggest that quilizumab may be an effec-
tive treatment of CSU. A recently performed multicenter, 
double-blind study with 32 adult CSU patients who were 
symptomatic despite H1 antihistamine treatment with or 
without LTRAs looked at responses to placebo (n = 17) 
or 450 mg quilizumab (n = 15) given subcutaneously at 
Day 1 and Day 29 [47]. The absolute change from base-
line to week 20 in the weekly itch score (the primary effi-
cacy outcome) decreased by 3.3 points and 1.5 points in 
patients treated with quilizumab relative to the placebo 
group at week 4 and 20, respectively. These decreases 
were not significantly different as compared to placebo 
and did not fall within the minimally important differ-
ence of 4.5–5. The reasons for this are likely to include the 
effects of quilizumab treatment on IgE levels. Quilizumab 
reduced median serum total IgE only by approximately 
30% from baseline at week 20, when it reached its lowest 
median level. Longer use of quilizumab in CSU patients 
or its combination with omalizumab may improve treat-
ment effects and lead to sustained responses. This should 
be explored in future studies.
Anti‑IL‑1 therapies
IL-1 is a key inflammatory cytokine of innate immunity. 
IL-1α and IL-1β both mediate their biologic responses 
via activation of the IL-1 receptor type I, whereas 
IL-1Rα functions as a receptor antagonist [48]. In the 
IL-1β-mediated autoinflammatory diseases Cryopyrin 
Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS) and Schnitzler 
Syndrome (SchS), non-itchy urticarial rash is a hallmark 
symptom. Recent findings suggest that IL-1β not only 
induces urticarial rashes in autoinflammatory diseases, 
but also plays a role in other allergy-related diseases such 
as bronchial asthma, contact hypersensitivity and atopic 
dermatitis [49]. In addition to the dramatic improvement 
of urticarial rashes in autoinflammatory syndromes upon 
IL-1 blocking treatments, IL-1 blocking therapies can 
also be effective in different types of urticaria including 
delayed pressure urticaria and cold urticaria [50, 51].
Also, the efficacy of anti-IL-1β monoclonal antibody 
canakinumab is now being evaluated in a phase II ran-
domized double-blind placebo controlled single center 
study in patients with moderate to severe chronic idio-
pathic urticaria (URTICANA) (NCT01635127). The pilot 
study is estimated to enroll 20 patients and the efficacy 
of subcutaneous injection of 150 mg of canakinumab will 
be evaluated with urticaria activity scores and daily weal 
scores 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after injection. There is another 
study evaluating the safety and efficacy of anti-IL-1β

receptor blocker rilonacept on cold contact urticaria, 
which is designed as a double-blind placebo-controlled 
phase II study (NCT02171416). The primary outcome 
measure critical temperature threshold will be evalu-
ated at day 42. Secondary outcomes include quality of life 
assessments and differences in mast cell mediator release. 
The estimated number of patients to be enrolled is 20 and 
the anticipated date of completion is April 2017.
PGD2 receptor antagonists
Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is a major product of the COX 
pathway and has long been implicated in diseases such as 
asthma and allergic rhinitis. The major source of PGD2 in 
allergic disease is thought to be the mast cell [52]. PGD2 
has three receptors: D-type prostanoid receptor (DP) 
1, Chemoattractant Receptor Homologous Molecule 
expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2) and the thromboxane 
receptor, which are expressed by endothelial and airway 
smooth muscle cells, as well as eosinophils, Th2 cells and 
basophils. [53–55]. The DP2 receptor CRTH2 is held to 
be responsible for the pro-inflammatory activities of 
PGD2in the pathogenesis of asthma and rhinitis [52]. The 
DP2 antagonist OC000459 has shown promising clinical 
effects in phase 2 studies in patients with rhino conjunc-
tivitis, asthma and eosinophilic oesophagitis [56–58]. 
There is an additional CRTH2 antagonist, QAW039, or 
fevipiprant, that is extensively tested in asthma, but also 
in allergic rhinitis and AD [59]. Expression of CRTH2 
was found to be increased on eosinophils of chronic 
urticaria patients but not acute urticaria [60]. Sterba 
et al. suggested that the DP2/CRTH2 pathway may be 
involved in the recruitment of eosinophils and basophils 
to CSU skin lesions [61]. There is an ongoing study with 
AZD1981; an oral, potent, selective, reversible antagonist 
of CRTH2, which is designed as a phase IIa, randomized, 
placebo-controlled, double-blinded study to assess its 
efficacy and safety in patients with CSU who are refrac-
tory to H1 antihistamines (NCT02031679). AZD1981, in 
this trial, is taken at 40 mg twice daily. Primary outcomes 
measures are urticaria activity scores and secondary 
outcome measures will be the quality of life benefit pro-
vided by treatment and the ability of AZD1981 to inhibit 
PGD2-induced eosinophil shape which will be assessed 
on days 21–28 and evaluation of adverse events on 8th 
week. The study estimates to enroll 48 patients.
Molecules that target intracellular pathways of mast cell 
activation following FceRI activation
There is a heightened releasability of mediators from 
mast cells and basophils in patients with urticaria [62]. 
Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is a central regulator in pro-
moting histamine release and cytokine, leukotriene and 
prostaglandin synthesis while Src homology 2 containing 
inositol phosphatases (SHIP-1 and SHIP-2) have inhibi-
tory activity [63]. Vonakis found a deficiency in SHIP 
in basophils of CSU patients and Saini showed that in 
patients with positive histamine release from mast cells 
upon anti-IgE stimulation, SHIP-2 was lowered and Syk 
was elevated [64, 65]. A potent and selective Syk inhibitor 
GSK2646264 is currently being evaluated in a topical for-
mulation in a randomised, double blinded study to assess 
its safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and pharma-
cokinetics in healthy controls and patients with cold 
urticaria or CSU. It is formulated as a 0.5 and 1% topi-
cal cream (NCT02424799). It Inhibits histamine release 
in vitro from basophils and mast cell lines, has excellent 
solubility with good skin penetration, is photostable and 
has desirable pharmacokinetics for skin delivery with 
a plasma t1/2, of 57 h so has potential for management 
of mast cell activation disorders in the skin. The assess-
ments will include tolerability measured with skin irrita-
tion scoring system and clinical laboratory safety tests. 
The study will include 80 patients and the estimated time 
for completion is November 2016.
A SHIP-1 activator (AQX-1125) is currently under 
investigation in a clinical study for patients with atopic 
dermatitis (NCT02324972) and may potentially be 
another targeted therapy for urticaria in the near future.
A list of drugs under investigation in clinical trials is 
given in Table 1.
Potential therapeutic targets for novel drug 
approaches
Therapies that target neuropeptide‑induced inflammation
Neuropeptides canact as mediators of inflammation 
and are found to be elevated in various allergic diseases 
including bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis [66]. A 
role for neuropeptides in urticaria has been suggested by 
the observation that substance P (SP) and other neuro-
peptides induce itch and weal formation in the skin, and 
SP has been shown to be a mast cell degranulator in vitro 
[67, 68]. Neuropeptide levels in CSU patients have been 
investigated in several studies. For example, Metz et al. 
found that serum SP is upregulated in CSU, and levels 
were correlated with disease activity [58, 69]. Serum lev-
els of neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y, vasoactive 
intestinal peptide, stem cell factor and nerve growth fac-
tor were shown to be significantly decreased after treat-
ment with H1 antihistamines in CSU patients [70, 71].
SP binds with different affinities to three neurokinin 
receptors (NKR 1–3), but mainly to NKR1, which is 
expressed in the central nervous system and the skin [72]. 
In recent case reports and case series, SP antagonists 
demonstrated a significant antipruritic effect in acute 
and chronic pruritus such as drug-induced pruritus, 
paraneoplastic pruritus, prurigo nodularis, cutaneous T

cell lymphoma, and brachioradial pruritus [73]. No side 
effects or only mild effects were reported in these studies. 
Wallengren et al. showed that a SP antagonist, spantide, 
was able to inhibit immediate and delayed type cutane-
ous hypersensitivity reactions [74]. The topical appli-
cation of aprepitant was not found to be successful in 
13 patients with pruritic skin conditions [75]. VLY-686 
(tradipitant), a novel oral NK-1 receptor antagonist, was 
investigated in two studies, which are completed but not 
yet reported: A phase I study (NCT01919944) to inves-
tigate its effects in the prevention and reduction of itch 
and skin reactions induced by SP injections, and a phase 
II proof of concept study (NCT02004041) to evaluate its 
efficacy in treatment-resistant pruritus in atopic dermati-
tis. After this proof of concept study, tradipitant is being 
investigated in the NCT02651714 study which is recruit-
ing atopic dermatitis patients with treatment resistant 
pruritus. Currently, aprepitant, serlopitant, tradipitant 
and orvepitant are under investigation. Studies on the 
effects of SP antagonists in CSU are needed.
Therapies that target the IgE–FcεRI interaction
DARPins (designed ankyrin repeat protein) are geneti-
cally engineered antibody mimetic proteins that exhibit 
highly specific and high affinity target protein binding. 
In contrast to monoclonal antibodies, DARPins are small 
oligonucleotides that act rapidly, can be used as oral 
drugs, and are inexpensive to produce. Recently, an IgE-
specific DARPin has been reported to bind IgE with very 
high affinity, causing IgE molecules to dissociate from 
high-affinity IgE receptors, and suppress mast cell acti-
vation [76]. DARPins are promising candidates for the 
treatment of allergic diseases as well as CSU.
Therapies that target complement C5a/C5a receptor
Some of the mast cell-activating autoantibodies involved 
in the pathogenesis of CSU belong to the complement 
fixing and activating subtypes IgG1 and IgG3 [77]. The 
binding of these antibodies to FcεRI or IgE leads to the 
generation of C5a, which interacts with the C5a recep-
tor localized on the surface of MCTC type mast cells (the 
dominant mast cells of the skin), thereby activating them 
to release mediators [17]. Fiebiger et al. showed that C5a 
receptor blockade of basophils or complement deple-
tion substantially reduced the histamine-releasing func-
tion of autoantibody-positive sera from CSU patients 
in vitro [77]. The proinflammatory effects of C5a have 
been implicated in various pathological conditions mak-
ing C5a and its receptors attractive targets for therapeu-
tic intervention for inflammatory diseases.
C5a binds to two receptors, C5aR and C5L2, of which 
C5aR is held to be more important for the proinflamma-
tory effects of C5a. In recent years, potent antagonists for 
C5aR have been developed including nonpeptide small 
molecules, C5a mutants, short peptides and cyclic pep-
tides, mAbs and antibody fragments [78]. Eculizumab is 
a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody directed 
against C5. Eculizumab is effective in treating paroxysmal 
nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical haemolytic-urae-
mic syndrome. It has been suggested that eculizumab 
may attenuate allergen-induced asthma responses in 
humans, but the clinical benefit with eculizumab for 
reducing allergic asthma consequences in humans 
remains unclear [79]. Eculizumab and other C5a antago-
nists currently under development should be assessed for 
their efficacy and safety in CSU.
Therapies that target the IL‑5/eosinophil pathway
There are a number of reports emphasizing the role 
of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of CSU. Kay et al. 
reported that CSU patients exhibit significantly increased 
numbers of eosinophils in non lesional skin as compared 
with control subjects, and IL-5 is increased in CSU skin 
lesions [11, 12]. Tissue factor expressed by eosinophils 
can induce the activation of blood coagulation generating 
thrombin which in turn can increase vascular permeabil-
ity both directly, acting on endothelial cells, and indi-
rectly, possibly by inducing degranulation of mast cells 
with release of histamine [22].
IL-5 induces the maturation, activation, and recruit-
ment of eosinophils. Biologicals interfering with 
IL-5 and its receptor comprise benralizumab, an 
anti-IL-5Ra mAb, as well as mepolizumab and resli-
zumab, two anti-IL-5 mAbs. Unlike mepolizumab and

reslizumab, benralizumab targets IL-5Ra and might 
affect leukocytes expressing low levels of IL-5Ra via 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity [44]. A 
randomized, placebo-controlled parallel-group study 
was performed in 40 adult patients with moderate-
to-severe atopic dermatitis, to evaluate the effect of a 
short term therapy with an anti-IL-5 antibody (mepoli-
zumab; 2 × 750 mg). Unfortunately, despite a significant 
decrease in peripheral blood eosinophils, two single 
doses of 750 mg mepolizumab did not result in clinical 
success in atopic dermatitis patients [80]. There is an 
ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind 
study (NCT01705795) evaluating the effect of anti-IL-
5-therapy in patients with bullous pemphigoid. These 
anti-IL-5 biologicals should be assessed in future stud-
ies on CSU.
Other targets
Targeting surface inhibitory receptors on mast cells 
might be a rational approach in treating allergic disor-
ders. There are promising new candidate receptors as 
targets for treatment of mast cell-basophil mediated dis-
eases. Among the inhibitory receptors, CD300a, FcγRIIB, 
and Siglec-8 have been shown to be expressed on MCs/
Bs with promising preclinical results [81]. Selective tar-
geting of CD300a receptor has been shown to be feasi-
ble for the treatment of mast cell and basophil mediated 
diseases [82]. The generation of agents targeting these 
receptors might also provide new insights in the treat-
ment of CSU.
H4 receptors have been shown to modulate the func-
tion of mast cells and basophils, and in experimental 
models they show some promise in alleviating histamine-
evoked itch [83–85]. A recent study explored the effec-
tiveness of the combination of a H1R antagonist and H4R 
antagonist on chronic allergic dermatitis established in 
NC/Nga mice [86]. The combination of H1R antagonist 
olopatadine and H4R antagonist JNJ7777120 improved 
scratching behavior and was more effective than each of 
the antagonists individually. The effect of antihistamines 
on itch in the study was attributed to both the effect on 
inflammation (the treatment reduced the tissue mast 
cells, cytokines, and chemokines) and the direct effect on 
the itch-mediating pathways. The H4 receptor antago-
nists may be potential targets in treating urticaria as well 
as other allergic skin disorders.
Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a TH2-initi-
ating cytokine that activates mast cells by innate immune 
mechanisms. TSLP has been shown to be increased 
in lesional but not nonlesional skin of CSU patients 
[11]. AMG 157 is a human monoclonal antibody that 
blocks the interaction of TSLP with its receptor and has 
been investigated in patients with atopic dermatitis in 
a placebo-controlled, randomized, double blind study 
(NCT00757042). The study has been completed but the 
results have not been published. Drugs that target the 
TSLP–TSLPR signaling axis via pharmacological inhi-
bition or by antibody-mediated neutralization of TSLP, 
could also be an option to treat CSU patients.
Cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) have been impli-
cated as potential sustainers of the late phase of CSU 
by selective recruitment and activation of inflammatory 
cells leading to tissue damage. ICAM-1, ELAM-1 and 
VCAM-1 showed an upregulation in CSU and P-selectin 
levels were elevated in both CSU and dermographism, 
but the most relevant finding at the cutaneous level 
seemed to be the strong production of CAMs also in 
unaffected skin. The elevation of CAMs in the weals as 
well as in unaffected skin has been interpreted as a sign 
of minimally persistent inflammation in patients with 
urticaria [87–90]. Cell adhesion inhibitors such as natali-
zumab (monoclonal antibody against α-4-integrin) may 
have a role in the treatment of CSU in the future.
IgE synthesis is suppressed by inhibition of the 
cytokines IL-4 or IL-13, therefore there have been 
attempts to influence IgE production at these steps. Bio-
logicals directed against IL-4Rα receptors are AMG-317, 
dupilumab and pitrakinra [44]. IL-13 targeting biologi-
cals encompass several anti-IL-13 mAbs including ABT-
308, anrukinzumab, IMA-026, lebrikizumab, CNTO, 
5825, GSK679586, QAX576 and tralokinumab [44]. The 
elevated levels of IL-4 and IL-13 in CSU patients have 
been reported before [91–93]. Therefore the agents tar-
geting IL-4 and IL-13, such as dupilumab, might have a 
role in the treatment of CSU in the future.
Possible future targets for treatment are given in 
Table 2. Figure 1 shows potential targets in the treatment 
of CSU.
Conclusion
CSU is a chronic disabling inflammatory skin disease, 
which is in many cases well-controlled by the existing 
licensed treatment options. In approximately 1 of 5 CSU 
patients, these treatment options are not sufficient. Novel 
drugs are needed and are under development. Ligeli-
zumab, PGD2 receptor antagonists, a topical Syk inhibi-
tor, and canakinumab are promising candidates for future 
CSU treatment options and are currently being tested in 
clinical trials for their efficacy and safety in CSU. Sub-
stance P antagonists, DARPins, blockers of C5a/C5aR, 
therapies targeting IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, and drugs that 
target inhibitory mast cell receptors should be tested in 
controlled CSU trials. Many other mediators and recep-
tors are held to be of pathogenic relevance, and this 
should be explored in skin profiling studies and func-
tional proof of concept studies.

One important point must not be forgotten when we 
search for new and better medication for the prevention 
and symptomatic treatment of CSU; the ultimate goal is 
to develop strategies and drugs that can cure CSU, rather 
than stop the signs and symptoms. The exploration of 
novel therapeutic targets for their role and relevance 
in CSU can help to achieve this, by providing a better 
understanding of its etiopathogenesis.
