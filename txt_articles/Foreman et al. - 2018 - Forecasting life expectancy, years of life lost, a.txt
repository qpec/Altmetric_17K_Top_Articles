Summary
Background Understanding potential trajectories in health and drivers of health is crucial to guiding long-term 
investments and policy implementation. Past work on forecasting has provided an incomplete landscape of future 
health scenarios, highlighting a need for a more robust modelling platform from which policy options and potential 
health trajectories can be assessed. This study provides a novel approach to modelling life expectancy, all-cause 
mortality and cause of death forecasts —and alternative future scenarios—for 250 causes of death from 2016 to 2040 
in 195 countries and territories.
Methods We modelled 250 causes and cause groups organised by the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors Study (GBD) hierarchical cause structure, using GBD 2016 estimates from 1990–2016, to generate 
predictions for 2017–40. Our modelling framework used data from the GBD 2016 study to systematically account 
for the relationships between risk factors and health outcomes for 79 independent drivers of health. We developed 
a three-component model of cause-specific mortality: a component due to changes in risk factors and select 
interventions; the underlying mortality rate for each cause that is a function of income per capita, educational 
attainment, and total fertility rate under 25 years and time; and an autoregressive integrated moving average 
model for unexplained changes correlated with time. We assessed the performance by fitting models with data 
from 1990–2006 and using these to forecast for 2007–16. Our final model used for generating forecasts and 
alternative scenarios was fitted to data from 1990–2016. We used this model for 195 countries and territories to 
generate a reference scenario or forecast through 2040 for each measure by location. Additionally, we generated 
better health and worse health scenarios based on the 85th and 15th percentiles, respectively, of annualised rates 
of change across location-years for all the GBD risk factors, income per person, educational attainment, select 
intervention coverage, and total fertility rate under 25 years in the past. We used the model to generate all-cause 
age-sex specific mortality, life expectancy, and years of life lost (YLLs) for 250 causes. Scenarios for fertility were 
also generated and used in a cohort component model to generate population scenarios. For each reference 
forecast, better health, and worse health scenarios, we generated estimates of mortality and YLLs attributable to 
each risk factor in the future.
Findings Globally, most independent drivers of health were forecast to improve by 2040, but 36 were forecast to 
worsen. As shown by the better health scenarios, greater progress might be possible, yet for some drivers such as 
high body-mass index (BMI), their toll will rise in the absence of intervention. We forecasted global life expectancy to 
increase by 4·4 years (95% UI 2·2 to 6·4) for men and 4·4 years (2·1 to 6·4) for women by 2040, but based on better 
and worse health scenarios, trajectories could range from a gain of 7·8 years (5·9 to 9·8) to a non-significant loss of 
0·4 years (–2·8 to 2·2) for men, and an increase of 7·2 years (5·3 to 9·1) to essentially no change (0·1 years 
[–2·7 to 2·5]) for women. In 2040, Japan, Singapore, Spain, and Switzerland had a forecasted life expectancy exceeding 
85 years for both sexes, and 59 countries including China were projected to surpass a life expectancy of 80 years by 
2040. At the same time, Central African Republic, Lesotho, Somalia, and Zimbabwe had projected life expectancies 
below 65 years in 2040, indicating global disparities in survival are likely to persist if current trends hold. Forecasted 
YLLs showed a rising toll from several non-communicable diseases (NCDs), partly driven by population growth and 
ageing. Differences between the reference forecast and alternative scenarios were most striking for HIV/AIDS, for 
which a potential increase of 120·2% (95% UI 67·2–190·3) in YLLs (nearly 118 million) was projected globally from 
2016–40 under the worse health scenario. Compared with 2016, NCDs were forecast to account for a greater proportion 
of YLLs in all GBD regions by 2040 (67·3% of YLLs [95% UI 61·9–72·3] globally); nonetheless, in many lower-income 
countries, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases still accounted for a large share of

Introduction
Health and social-services planning and investments 
require consideration of possible future trends in health 
and corresponding drivers. Many choices have long lag 
periods between initial investments and their effects, 
which can unfold over several decades; examples include 
training in different medical specialties, research and 
development for new drugs and vaccines, health system 
infrastructure construction, fiscal solvency of social 
security or health insurance, and policy implementation. 
Forecasts and alternative scenarios can help to frame 
these choices and to identify areas of more or less 
uncertainty. For instance, determining whether a country 
is likely to see more deaths from diabetes amid decreases 
in deaths from tuberculosis can serve as a crucial input 
to inform national policy dialogues and resource 
allocation. Quantitative forecasts of mortality and causes 
of death might be useful in this respect, particularly 
if they are linked to forecast and posited changes or 
alternative scenarios derived from the main independent 
drivers of population health. Such drivers include risk 
factors (eg, tobacco use, hypertension, air pollution, diet, 
and sanitation), interventions (eg, HIV treatment and 
vaccinations), and broader sociodemographic and health 
system factors.
Health forecasts, sometimes known as reference 
scenarios, aim to delineate the most likely future health 
trends. Forecast performance or accuracy can be em-
pirically assessed by withholding data from recent 
periods and comparing forecasts generated without 
these data with what actually happened. Nonetheless, 
even forecasts based on models with a good out-of-time 
performance cannot anticipate all future drivers of 
health change. For example, no model from the 1970s 
would have forecast the HIV epidemic or, more recently, 
a cure for hepatitis C. Health forecasts are fundamentally 
im 
perfect, grounded only in what we know of the past 
and present; such forecasts can and should be 
supplemented with alternative scenarios that examine 
the universe of plausible futures. Alternative scenarios 
are particularly useful when they are linked to actionable 
choices that can affect different health drivers. A 
comprehensive forecast and scenarios frame 
work for 
mortality and causes of death should possess two key 
attributes: good out-of-time forecast performance; and 
preservation of the causal effects for independent drivers 
and health outcomes that are consistent with known 
evidence from randomised controlled trials, and cohort 
or other observational studies.
Many disease-specific forecasts and some alternative 
scenarios have been published for particular countries 
or regions.1–8 Likewise, demographers in governments 
and intergovernmental agencies routinely produce 
forecasts of all-cause mortality using models based on 
YLLs in 2040 (eg, 53·5% of YLLs [95% UI 48·3–58·5] in Sub-Saharan Africa). There were large gaps for many health 
risks between the reference forecast and better health scenario for attributable YLLs. In most countries, metabolic 
risks amenable to health care (eg, high blood pressure and high plasma fasting glucose) and risks best targeted by 
population-level or intersectoral interventions (eg, tobacco, high BMI, and ambient particulate matter pollution) had 
some of the largest differences between reference and better health scenarios. The main exception was sub-Saharan 
Africa, where many risks associated with poverty and lower levels of development (eg, unsafe water and sanitation, 
household air pollution, and child malnutrition) were projected to still account for substantive disparities between 
reference and better health scenarios in 2040.
Interpretation With the present study, we provide a robust, flexible forecasting platform from which reference 
forecasts and alternative health scenarios can be explored in relation to a wide range of independent drivers of 
health. Our reference forecast points to overall improvements through 2040 in most countries, yet the range found 
across better and worse health scenarios renders a precarious vision of the future—a world with accelerating 
progress from technical innovation but with the potential for worsening health outcomes in the absence of 
deliberate policy action. For some causes of YLLs, large differences between the reference forecast and alternative 
scenarios reflect the opportunity to accelerate gains if countries move their trajectories toward better health 
scenarios—or alarming challenges if countries fall behind their reference forecasts. Generally, decision makers 
should plan for the likely continued shift toward NCDs and target resources toward the modifiable risks that drive 
substantial premature mortality. If such modifiable risks are prioritised today, there is opportunity to reduce 
avoidable mortality in the future. However, CMNN causes and related risks will remain the predominant health 
priority among lower-income countries. Based on our 2040 worse health scenario, there is a real risk of HIV 
mortality rebounding if countries lose momentum against the HIV epidemic, jeopardising decades of progress 
against the disease. Continued technical innovation and increased health spending, including development 
assistance for health targeted to the world’s poorest people, are likely to remain vital components to charting a 
future where all populations can live full, healthy lives.

recent time trends.3,9 Comprehensive forecasts of all-
cause mortality and causes of death have occurred less 
often: two studies forecast the entire Global Burden of 
Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors Study (GBD) cause 
list while another looked at large cause categories over 
time.10–12 Such work forecasted an anticipated con-
tinuation of the epidemiologic transition, with a global 
shift 
from 
com 
municable 
to 
non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs) as the predominant cause of burden. 
While comprehensive, these studies did not report on 
forecast performance and did not systematically account 
for causal pathways of health changes consistent with 
randomised controlled trials and cohort studies. Some 
country-specific forecasts show the alarming potential 
of rising obesity and sub 
sequent declines in life 
expectancy, particularly driven by increased diabetes-
related morbidity and mortality.13 As health and social 
service agencies face an increasing set of complex 
challenges (eg, population ageing, escalating expenses, 
and shortages in health-care providers), the value of 
robust forecasts and alternative scenarios that can chart 
probable health futures and options for modifying these 
trajectories rises in tandem.
The GBD provides a unique resource from which a new 
generation of health forecasts with alter 
native scenarios 
can be developed.14,15 GBD has refined the collection and 
standardisation of detailed health and risk data over 
several recent publication cycles and now covers, from 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Health forecasts and alternative future scenarios can serve as 
vital inputs into long-term planning and investments in 
health, particularly in terms of framing different choices, their 
potential effects, and the relative certainty associated with 
each option. Past work to generate health-focused forecasts 
includes that from the UN Population Division, which 
routinely produces all-cause mortality forecasts through year 
2100, and the Austrian Wittgenstein Center, which produces 
life expectancy forecasts with different scenarios to the end of 
the 21st century. Longer-range forecasts have also been 
developed to assess the potential effects of climate change on 
mortality. Furthermore, various national agencies produce 
country-level mortality forecasts, and forecasts for individual 
causes of death have been produced periodically as well. 
Comprehensive forecasts of cause-specific and all-cause 
mortality were developed as part of the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 1990 (GBD 1990); those methods were then 
applied for the period from 2002–30. The primary purpose of 
these past modelling efforts was to generate reference or 
baseline forecasts of what was likely to occur on the basis of 
past trends; however, few—if any—offered insights into a 
range of future scenarios while accounting for independent 
drivers of potential health changes.
Added value of this study
With this study, we provided a completely novel approach to 
forecasting all-cause and cause-specific mortality and scenario 
construction. Our modelling framework was designed to 
leverage the data on risk outcome relationships in the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 such 
that the relationship between risk factors (eg, smoking) and 
specific disease outcomes (eg, lung cancer) were consistent 
with relevant cohort studies and randomised controlled trials. 
Because this forecasting framework is grounded in 
79 independent drivers of health change, we could leverage 
these models to generate a full suite of alternative scenarios 
beyond reference forecasts. The overall model has three 
components: a model for risk-attributable deaths, a model for 
mortality not explained by risk factors that is a function of the 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and other covariates 
depending on the cause and time, and an autoregressive 
integrated moving average process for the unexplained latent 
trends for each location-age-sex-cause. To ensure the 
robustness of this framework, we assessed the overall model 
performance by fitting it to data from 1990–2006 and 
evaluating its forecasts for 2007–2016. Our model performed 
better than other widely used methods such as Lee-Carter. 
Based on our model, we generated reference scenarios for 
all-cause mortality, life expectancy, and 250 causes of death for 
195 countries and territories from 2016–40. Additionally, 
we assessed better health and worse health scenarios for each 
metric by country, reflecting the 85th and 15th percentiles, 
respectively, of the annualised rates of change observed for the 
drivers across locations in the past.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our reference forecast predicted continued declines in global 
mortality and improvements in life expectancy, though at a 
slower rate than achieved in the past. Because of faster 
progress among many lower-SDI countries, absolute disparities 
between countries are currently projected to narrow by 2040. 
Nonetheless, the differences between better health and worse 
health scenarios for 2040 remain substantial, emphasising 
that the reference forecast is not inevitable and thus policy 
choices made today can profoundly affect each country’s 
future health trajectories. For most countries, prioritising 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and NCD-related risks in 
health planning and investment decisions has the potential to 
markedly reduce premature mortality by 2040. Although NCDs 
were projected to rise in many low-SDI countries, 
communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases 
are likely to remain among the leading causes of early death. 
Furthermore, based on our 2040 worse health scenario, 
rebounds in HIV mortality and thus reversals in life expectancy 
could occur if countries cannot maintain the gains achieved in 
the past. Continued technical innovation and increased health 
spending, both domestic and international funding targeted to 
countries with the most need, are crucial for a future where all 
people have the opportunity to live full, healthy lives.

1990–2016, 195 countries and territories with data on 
cause-specific and all-cause mortality, risk factors, and 
selected interventions.16,17 The GBD com 
parative risk 
assessment, with its meta-analyses of published studies 
(ie, randomised trials and cohort and other observational 
data) on risk-outcome causal relationships, enables the 
modelling of future disease burden while accounting 
for drivers of health change.16 Additionally, an overall 
measure of development—the Socio-demographic Index 
(SDI)—was developed as part of GBD, providing a 
mechanism for assessing the effects of improved de-
velopment on health. Drawing from the broader GBD 
study, we have developed a novel forecasting model, 
producing reference forecast, better health scenario, and 
worse health scenario for life expectancy, all-cause 
mortality, and cause-specific mortality from 250 causes 
from 2017–40 in 195 countries and territories. By lev-
eraging the relationships between independent drivers of 
health captured within GBD, we provide a robust platform 
from which alternative scenarios can be assessed, which 
could be vital inputs for strategies and investments to 
improve population health.
Methods
Overall forecasting model structure
We modelled 250 causes and cause groups organised by 
the GBD hierarchical cause structure, using GBD data 
from 1990–2016 to generate predictions from 2017–2040. 
Predictions were made for 195 countries and territories 
modelled in GBD 2016, referred to as locations in 
this study. For 246 of these causes, we developed a 
three-component model of cause-specific mortality: 
a component explained by changes in behavioural, 
metabolic, and environmental risks, and select inter-
ventions quantified in GBD; a component explained by 
income per person, educational attainment, and total 
fertility rate under 25 years, which was combined into 
the SDI metric, and time; and an autoregressive 
integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to capture 
the unexplained component correlated over time.18 We 
summarise the overall model and individual components 
below; further detail and model formulae are in 
appendix 1 (pp 7–31).
The model’s main component captured the prevalence 
for 65 risk factors reported in GBD 2016 and the relative 
risks (RRs) between levels of risk exposure and each 
GBD outcome. GBD 2016 reported RRs for each risk-
outcome pair based on meta-analyses of randomised 
trials and cohort studies.16 Details, including how risks 
operate through each other such as body-mass index 
(BMI) through systolic blood pressure and choles-
terol, are provided elsewhere (appendix 1, pp 12–21). 
Interventions quantified in GBD currently include 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people living with 
HIV, prevention of mother-to-child transmission of 
HIV, met need for family planning with modern 
con 
traception methods, and vaccination coverage of 
dip 
htheria, tetanus, pertussis, (three doses) and measles; 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; and vaccination cov-
erage of rotavirus; and Haemophilus influenzae type B. 
We refer to these risks, interventions, and measures 
of development as independent drivers, a term that 
originates in regression terminology and does not imply 
that the drivers are independent of each other. For 
instance, we used SDI rather than its individual com-
ponents because of their strong correlations with each 
other.
Our model’s second component captured relationships 
between variations in each cause of death that were not 
explained by risks and interventions (ie, underlying 
mortality rate) to three variables reflective of overall 
development: income per person, educational attainment 
among populations aged 15 years and older, and total 
fertility rate under 25 years.18 Because of high co-linearity 
between these three factors, we used SDI, which 
combines all three into a single measure.17 For some 
causes, other independent variables with strong known 
relationships for which data were available (ie, age-
specific fertility for maternal causes, HIV mortality for 
maternal HIV, and vehicles per person for road injuries) 
or risks which could not be quantified in terms of 
RR because they are part of the disease definition 
(eg, systolic blood pressure for hypertensive heart 
disease, fasting plasma glucose [FPG] for diabetes, and 
alcohol consumption for alcohol-related cirrhosis; other 
risks are in appendix 1 [p 14]) were added as additional 
model covariates. For these two model components, 
we specified the following relationship between the 
logarithm of cause-specific mortality and drivers of 
mortality:
where αla is a location-age-specific intercept, β0 is a global 
effect on an SDI of less than 0·8, β1 is a global effect on 
an SDI of more than 0·8, θa is an age-specific secular 
trend, and § is the scalar capturing the effects of all 
relevant risks or interventions on each cause, with 
separate models fitted for each cause-sex pair. Thus, on 
the log scale we modelled the total cause-specific 
mortality rate (mT) as the sum of the underlying mortality 
captured by SDI, the secular trend, and a scalar 
component that captures the effect of relevant risks or 
interventions for that cause. We used a broken stick 
(linear piecewise) spline on SDI (one piece for SDI 
between 0 and 0·8, another piece for 0·8 to 1·0) to 
account for rates of change in underlying mortality 
among 
high-SDI 
countries. 
For 
several 
NCDs 
(eg, diabetes and stroke), for which mortality has 
substantially decreased in many high-SDI countries, we 
also included an SDI*time interaction effect; more detail 
is in appendix 1 (pp 9–12).

Our model’s third component captured variation over 
time that was not explained by independent drivers 
included in the first two components. This was achieved 
by fitting ARIMA models to the residual trends that 
remained from the first two components. Appendix 1 
details the ARIMA specifications used and outlines how 
the ARIMA component was organised hierarchically (ie, 
a more robust residual trend on all-cause mortality was 
used to constrain the more sensitive cause-specific 
residual trends; appendix 1, pp 10–12).
We developed separate models for some causes of 
death because of their unique nature, largely following 
GBD methods.17 For deaths from stochastic events such 
as conflict and natural disasters, we randomly sampled 
past death rates from 1950–2016 for location, age group, 
and sex 1000 times for each year in the future and then 
applied an SDI-adjustment factor derived from by how 
much increases in SDI were associated with reducing 
mortality from such events in the past. For HIV 
mortality, we sought to account for its high sensitivity to 
changes in intervention coverage by projecting 
incidence hazard, ART, prevention of mother-to-child 
transmission of HIV, and co-trimoxazole coverage. 
These forecasts were informed by a frontier analysis to 
predict ART prices19 and translating predicted funding 
into expected treat 
ment coverage. Incidence hazards 
were generated for each scenario using a rate of change 
approach across high-prevalence and low-prevalence 
countries with additional discounting from forecasted 
ART coverage (appendix 1, pp 32–40). We then used 
these inputs and scenarios in Spectrum,20–22 a cohort 
component model used by GBD and UNAIDS that 
applies disease progression parameters to an age-
specific and sex-specific population over time; these 
results provided a full time series of HIV mortality by 
location through 2040.
We calculated the years of life lost (YLLs)—a measure 
of premature mortality—by summing up the remaining 
life expectancy for people dying in each age group. For 
GBD 2016, the reference life expectancy at birth was 
86·6 years, derived from the lowest observed risk of 
death for each 5-year age group; to avoid problems 
associated with small numbers, we restricted this 
calculation to all populations greater than 5 million 
individuals in 2016. Age-standardised mortality rates and 
YLL rates were computed using the world standard 
population developed for the GBD study, which is a time-
invariant standard.17
Reference forecasts, and better health and worse health 
scenarios
For each independent driver—65 risk factors, select 
interventions, income per person, educational attain-
ment, and total fertility rate under 25 years—we 
developed reference forecasts through 2040 and 
two alternative scenarios: better health and worse health. 
These scenarios corresponded with the relative effect of 
these drivers on health outcomes; they did not 
necessarily reflect societal valuations of other non-health 
consequences. Below, we summarise the models used to 
forecast independent drivers of health; more details are 
in appendix 1 (pp 15–31).
We produced better health and worse health scenarios 
by taking the 85th and 15th percentiles, respectively, of 
annualised rates of change (ARC) observed across all 
locations and years in the past and constructed hypo-
thetical future scenarios to show what would happen if 
each place had that level of change in the future. In 
cases where the reference scenario was higher than the 
85th percentile or lower than the 15th percentile, the 
reference was used as the better health or worse health 
scenario, respectively. Further computational details 
regarding reference forecasts and scenarios are in 
appendix 1 (p 20).
Modeling the independent drivers of health 
GBD 2015 introduced SEVs, a univariate measure of 
RR-weighted prevalence of risks that allowed all risk 
exposures, whether dichotomous, polytomous, or con-
tinuous, to be reported on a 0–1 scale.24 For SEVs, 
0 indicates that no one in the population is at increased 
risk and 1 indicates that the whole population has levels 
of exposure associated with the highest risk. We forecast 
SEVs for each risk by location, age, and sex using the 
weighted mean of its past ARC, and projecting these 
rates into the future. These weights allow for more recent 
trends to be more heavily weighted in forecasts; weight 
selection was based on out-of-sample predictive validity 
(appendix 1, pp 16–20). For each cause of death, we 
combined relevant risks to calculate the population-level 
RR or scalar, then multiplied this value by the underlying 
mortality rate in the future (appendix 1, pp 13–15).
We produced reference forecasts for income per 
person by testing an ensemble pool of 11 520 individual 
models from 1970–2017, each of which captured 
relationships between the annual log growth rate in 
income and a different combination of demographic 
indicators, time-series components, and weighting 
functions.23 This ensemble pool and its corresponding 
model selection are described in more detail in 
appendix 1 (pp 26–28). We generated better health and 
worse health scenarios by scaling the growth rate to the 
85th and 15th percentiles of the residuals from a model 
of log growth rate against income level, which captured 
plausible variation in income growth.
Data for mean years of education and the proportion 
of women of reproductive age who had their need 
for family planning satisfied with modern methods 
(ie, contraceptive met need) were from GBD 2017 and 
were forecasted from the weighted mean of their past 
ARC in a similar framework as the SEVs for risk factors 
(appendix 1, pp 28–30).
For age-specific fertility, we first modelled fertility in 
women aged 20–24 years based on met need for

2057
contraception and women’s educational attainment in 
that age group, plus an ARIMA to capture recent latent 
trends in each location. We modelled fertility in other age 
groups (10–14 and 15–19 years, and 5-year bins from 
25–49 years) based on the age-specific fertility of the 
20–24 year-olds, accounting for possible non-linear 
relationships and age-specific contraceptive met need 
where applicable. We combined estimates of age-specific 
fertility to calculate the total fertility rate under 25 years 
and produced better and worse health scenarios of each 
fertility metric based on corresponding better and worse 
health scenarios of estimated female education and met 
need for family planning (appendix pp 30–32). We 
forecasted population by using our all-cause mortality 
and age-specific fertility forecasts as inputs to a cohort 
component model. Initial population in 2016 and annual 
net migration projections were derived from UN 
Population Division estimates.9
Vaccine coverage
We forecasted coverage for the diphtheria, tetanus, and 
pertussis vaccine, and the measles-containing vaccine, 
1 dose using linear models with SDI as an independent 
variable. H influenzae type B vaccine, pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine, and rotavirus vaccines, which have 
not yet been introduced in all countries, were modelled 
relative to third-dose diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis 
vaccine, and were assumed to scale up to this ratio with 
this vaccination coverage for each country over time. 
For countries with known introduction dates, we ran 
spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression on the 
ratio of vaccine coverage to third-dose diphtheria, 
tetanus, and pertussis vaccine coverage, mirroring GBD 
methods.16,17,25 For the other countries, we simulated 
introduction dates based on a Weibull distribution and 
generated theoretical scale-up curves for each year 
(appendix 1 pp 22–24).
Model validation and forecasting analysis
We assessed the overall performance of the forecasting 
and scenarios framework by fitting models using only 
data from 1990–2006 and then forecasting from 2007–16. 
Out-of-sample validation forecasts for 2014–16 were then 
compared with observed data for 2014–16. We assessed 
model performance using two metrics: mean error 
(a measure of bias) and root-mean-squared error (a 
measure of accuracy). Appendix 1 provides these metrics 
for life expectancy, all-cause mortality, and cause-specific 
mortality (pp 43–59). Our model was better at forecasting 
all-cause mortality and life expectancy than the most-
widely used demographic approach, the Lee-Carter 
method.26 To generate forecasts, we re-fit the model for 
the entire period of 1990–2016.
Uncertainty analysis
We sought to propagate uncertainty from both model 
parameters and inputs throughout our estimation 
process. We sampled correlated draws of each parameter 
from the variance-covariance matrix of each fitted model 
when generating predictions. We incorporated uncer-
tainty from the GBD by predicting each independent 
driver and cause-specific mortality rate in 2016, finding 
the difference between predicted draws and GBD 2016 
draws in log space, then adding that correction factor to 
2017–40 forecasts at the draw level. Point estimates were 
computed as the mean of 1000 draws from the final draw 
distribution and 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) from 
the 2·5 and 97·5 percentiles.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The corresponding author had full access to 
all the data in the study and had final responsibility for 
the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Global trends and patterns through 2040
The course of future all-cause and cause-specific mortality 
largely will be determined by how trends in key drivers 
unfold (figure 1). Most of these drivers were projected to 
improve, whereas 36 were forecast to worsen by 2040. 
Uneven distributions of progress for drivers such as 
income per person and education suggested that many 
locations are unlikely to see conditions improve based on 
current forecasts. For instance, by 2040, 31 countries were 
forecast to be still classified as low-income (ie, income per 
person less than US$1000, per the World Bank), while 
36 countries averaged less than 10 years of education 
among populations aged 25 years and older. The better 
health scenario highlighted the potential for accelerated 
progress; nonetheless, eight countries would remain low-
income and 31 would average less 10 years of education 
under this scenario.
With increasing SDI, many countries were projected 
to see rising metabolic and behavioural risks, including 
some dietary risks, alcohol, and smoking. Because high 
BMI has increased almost everywhere since 1990, its 
continued rise was forecasted through 2040—even in 
the better health scenario. Similarly, high FPG and 
systolic blood pressure were projected to increase 
through 2040; however, because of advances in 
treatment and expansion of NCD risk management in 
some countries, the better health scenario reflected the 
future potential for reducing these metabolic risks. By 
contrast, continued decreases in risks that generally 
improve alongside gains in development (eg, low 
birthweight, child malnutrition, household air pollution, 
unsafe water and sanitation) were forecasted for the 
reference and better health scenarios; at the global level, 
the 2040 worse health scenario ranged from similar 
levels in 2016 to moderately higher levels of risk 
exposure. Country-level smoking trends were markedly 
variable in the past, corresponding with where countries

fertility rate under 25 years, (D) Socio-demographic Index, (E) met need for 
contraception, (F) diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis dose 3 vaccination,

show distinction between year estimates in the past and scenarios in the future. 
Data are the 1990 Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) estimate, the 2016 
GBD estimate, the 2040 forecast, the 2040 better health scenario, and the 2040 
worse health scenario. Shown are the top 20 risks ranked from 1–20 by the 
number of risk-attributable years of life lost in 2016, and ordered horizontally, 
across rows. The estimate for each country is the age-standardised mean value 
across both sexes, and a Gaussian kernel density estimator produced a 
distribution from the estimates for all countries. Vertical lines represent the 
global population-weighted average, whereas the density distribution gives 
each of the 195 countries equal weight. FPG=fasting plasma glucose.

are on the tobacco-epidemic curve and in the scale-up of 
tobacco control;27 subsequently, our better and worse 
health scenarios showed comparably varied future 
trajectories. In 2016, the age-standardised prevalence of 
smoking over age 30 years was 19·4% (95% UI 
19·2–19·6) globally, with a reference forecast of 14·5% 
(14·3–14·7) in 2040, and the better health scenario 
showed the potential to reduce prevalence to 10·4% 
(10·3–10·6). Conversely, the worse health scenario 
portended global stagnation—or potential reversal—for 
progress against smoking, with a projected age-
standardised prevalence of 20·6% (20·3–20·8) in 2040. 
Globally, ambient particulate matter increased from 
1990–2016, but country-level trends showed widening 
inequalities in levels of exposure, with some countries 
achieving substantial declines.28,29 As a result, our 
reference forecast showed similar levels of exposure in 
2040 as in 2016, whereas our better health scenario 
showed the potential for substantial reductions.
Figure 2 shows examples of all-cause mortality 
modelling for men and women in China and Australia. 
For each country and age group, we compared ARCs for 
underlying and total death rates observed 1990–2016, and 
then ARCs for predicted death rates from 2017–40 based 
on the three model components. In China, past ARCs for 
underlying mortality nearly equalled ARCs for total 
mortality in most age groups, suggesting that the net 
effects of risk factors and select interventions were not a 
large contributor to past progress in China. Conversely, 
underlying plus risk factor mortality ARC was faster in 
the future than the ARCs in underlying alone, particularly 
among adult age groups; this indicates risk factors could 
have a larger effect on future changes in China’s total 
mortality. Compared with China, different patterns 
emerged for Australia; for instance, among populations 
older than 50 years, past ARCs were fuelled partly by 
favourable risk factor trends, as shown by faster declines 
in total versus underlying mortality. From 2016–40, 
Australia’s under 
lying mortality rate was projected to 
decline less rapidly because of slowed increases in SDI 
and relative stagnation of risk trends with respect to the 
all-cause death rate. As with China, the ARIMA 
component contributed to widening UIs substantially for 
each age group.
Based on reference forecasts and scenarios from 
2016–40 (figure 3), a range of global demographic trends 
have the potential to unfold. Although total population 
was projected to increase in each trajectory, estimates 
spanned from 8·7 billion (95% UI 8·5–8·9) in 2040 
under the better health scenario (a 17·2% increase since 
2016) to 9·0 billion (8·7–9·2) under the worse health 
scenario (a 21·0% rise since 2016). This range was 
primarily driven by differences in forecasted total fertility 
rate, which would essentially stagnate from 2016–40 
under the worse health scenario, and subsequent effects 
in population age structure. Compared with 2016, all 
three scenarios point to a much larger proportion of the 
overall population older than 10 years; it is projected to 
increase from 82·8% in 2016 to 84·8% (95% UI 
84·0–85·5) under the worse health scenario, 87·5% 
(86·8–88·0) in the reference scenario, and 88·7% 
(88·2–89·2) in the better health scenario. However, under 
the age of 25, vastly different population patterns could 
emerge by 2040. The reference and better health scenarios 
each showed declines in total population under age 10, 
from 1·3 billion in 2016 to 1·1 billion (1·0–1·2) and 
1·0 billion (0·9–1·1) in 2040, respectively. Conversely, the 
population under age 10 years in the worse health 
scenario was expected to increase to 1·4 billion (1·3–1·5) 
by 2040. This range reflects the effect of forecasted fertility 
and the potential vast differences in population structure 
under different scenarios.
Global life expectancy was projected to increase by 
4·4 years (95% UI 2·2–6·4) for men and 4·4 years 
(2·1–6·4) for women by 2040, to 74·3 years (72·1–76·4) 
and 79·7 years (77·4–81·8), respectively. The better 
health scenario showed a potential increase of 7·8 years 
(5·9–9·8) and 7·2 years (5·3–9·1) for male and female 
life expectancy, rising to 77·8 years (75·7–79·7) for men 
and 82·5 years (80·5–84·5) for women in 2040. The 
worse health scenario had both male and female life 
expectancy plateauing through 2040 (ie, a non-
significant loss of 0·4 years [–2·8 to 2·2] for men and a 
non-significant decrease of 0·1 years [–2·7 to 2·5] for 
women, to 69·5 years [67·1–72·1] and 75·2 [72·6–78·0], 
respectively). Compared with the past, global progress 
in extending life expectancy was forecasted to be slower 
from 2016–40. This trend resulted from forecasts of 
slowed advances on key drivers such as SDI; worsening 
of several risks, particularly high BMI; and stagnated 
gains on cardiovascular diseases, which was a major 
factor in historical improvements in life expectancy.
Reference forecasts showed a 37·6% increase (95% UI 
22·7–54·0) in total deaths by 2040 (table), rising from 
54·7 million in 2016 to 75·3 million (67·3–83·9) in 2040. 
By contrast, projected total YLLs had a non-significant 
drop, reflecting the effects of aging and projected

life expectancy gains. By 2040, the reference forecast 
showed that 12·0% (9·3–16·3) of global deaths were due 
to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional 
(CMNN) diseases; 81·0% (75·5–84·4) to NCDs; and 
7·0% (5·9–8·0) to injuries. Better and worse health 
scenarios both showed a continued global transition 
from CMNN to NCDs, yet how this shift could occur 
varied considerably across scenarios. For instance, in the 
better health scenario, 11·3% (9·0–15·7) of deaths and 
18·9% (15·4–23·0) of YLLs were from CMNN causes. 
The worse health scenario predicted 14·9% (11·6–20·0) 
of deaths and 27·6% (22·9–33·2) of YLLs from CMNN 
causes in 2040. 
Assessing differences and ranges for reference forecasts 
compared with better and worse health scenarios identi-
fied important opportunities for accelerating progress—or 
threats of reversing health gains. For instance, the global 
reference forecast for HIV
/AIDS YLLs showed a 30·6% 
decline (19·1–40·4) from 2016–40. The better health 
scenario had HIV
/AIDS YLLs decreasing more than 50%. 
Yet if the worse health scenario prevails, a 120·2% increase 
(67·2–190·3) in YLLs—or nearly 118 million YLLs—from 
HIV
/AIDs could occur by 2040. For most of the leading 
NCDs, reference forecasts showed rising YLLs by 2040; 
however, for some causes such as ischaemic heart disease, 
projections under the better health scenario showed 
possible declines by 2040. Reference forecasts for chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and tracheal, 
bronchus, and lung cancer had moderate YLL increases 
from 2016–40, while the better health scenario had small, 
non-significant decreases for each cause. For many NCDs, 
including COPD and lung cancer, the worse health 
scenario pointed to YLL increases exceeding 70% by 2040. 
Projections across all scenarios showed rising YLLs due to

of change are calculated from 2016 to 2040 in the forecasts and from 1990 to 2016 on past GBD estimates. GBD=Global Burden of Disease Study. EN=early neonatal. LN=late neonatal. 
PN=post-neonatal. Std=age standardised.

Figure 3: Global distribution of population in 2016 and 2040 reference forecasts, 2040 better health scenario, and 2040 worse health scenario
Data are shown (A) by age and sex and by (B) total fertility rate, (C) life expectancy, and (D) population. Triangles within the population pyramid represent the mean age globally for males and females 
for corresponding years and forecasts. Inlays show total population forecasts, and associated inputs into the population forecast: fertility and life expectancy.
several cancers, including cervical, breast, colon and 
rectum, and liver cancers, reflecting the effects of both 
population growth and ageing. Such demographic factors 
were also pro 
nounced for Alzheimer’s disease and other 
dementias, for which deaths and YLLs more than doubled 
by 2040 in each scenario; and diabetes, for which YLLs 
were forecast to rise in all scenarios for 2040 (ie, a 76·7% 
[10·3–228·8] 
increase 
for 
the 
reference; 
11·6% 
[–27·3 to 100·5] for better and 169·3% [66·7 to 397·1] for 
worse. Injury YLLs generally showed potential for sizeable 
decreases in the future, as exemplified by the reference 
and better health scenarios for 2040. However, for some 
injuries, including road injuries and self-harm, 2040 worse 
health scenarios showed rising YLLs and deaths.
Deaths from lower respiratory infections (LRIs) were 
pro 
jected to increase between 2016 (2·4 million 
[2·1–2·5]) and 2040 (3·1 million [2·4–3·9]). YLLs for 
LRIs, however, were forecasted to de 
crease by 24·8% 
(–3·4 to 47·9), surpassing the more moderate reduction 
in projected all-cause YLLs in 2040. These results 
represent how LRIs have their greatest toll among both 
children younger than 5 years and elderly people, and 
thus population ageing may differentially affect overall 
measures of mortality from LRIs. Relative to the 
reference forecast, the range between better and worse 
health scenarios provides a signal on the scope for 
policy change. Among the leading causes of death and 
YLLs, the largest range-to-reference ratios included 
HIV/AIDS, neonatal disorders, road injuries, diarrhoeal 
diseases, tuberculosis, lung cancer, and stroke. This 
metric was particularly pronounced for HIV/AIDS, with 
the ratio exceeding 2 for deaths and YLLs.
From 2016–40, the reference forecast showed the 
potential for major shifts in the leading causes of YLLs 
(figure 4). While the leading three causes of YLLs in 2016 
remained the same in 2040 (ie, ischaemic heart disease, 
stroke, and LRIs), most of the top ten causes fell in rank 
by 2040. The primary exception was COPD, which was 
forecasted to rise from 9th to 4th between 2016 and 2040. 
Several other NCDs were projected to rise in ranking by 
2040, particularly diabetes (from 15th to 7th), chronic 
kidney disease (from 16th to 5th), and Alzheimer’s 
disease (from 18th to 6th). By comparing forecasted 
changes in terms of total YLLs, all-age YLL rates, and age-
standardised YLL rates, the amount by which shifts in 
projected population growth and age structure account 
for changing patterns, as compared with cause-specific 
mortality rates, can be parsed out. For many NCDs, 
population growth and ageing fuelled their upward 
trajectories, with significant increases projected from 
2016–40. By contrast, several CMNN causes, including 
HIV
/AIDS, neonatal disorders, and malaria, recorded 
significant reductions across all three measures as well 
as relative rank; these trends underscore the potential for

Figure 4: Leading 20 Level 3 causes of YLLs globally in 2016 and 2040 by rank order
Figure shows percentage changes in the number of years of life lost (YLLs), all-age, and age-standardised rates. Rectangles are colour-coded based on Global Burden 
of Disease (GBD) Level 1 cause hierarchy: red=communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases; blue=non-communicable causes; green=injuries. Causes 
are connected by lines between time periods, with solid lines representing increasing relative rank and dashed lines representing decreasing rank. From 2016 to 2040, 
three measures of change are shown: percentage change in total number of YLLs, percentage change in the all-age YLL rate, and percentage change in the 
age-standardised YLL rate. Statistically significant changes are in bold. COPD=chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Neonatal preterm birth=neonatal disorders due 
to preterm birth complications.
continued progress against these causes in parallel with 
changing demographic patterns. Two causes of injuries—
road injuries and self-harm—ranked among the leading 
20 causes of death in 2016, but showed divergent trends 
by 2040. Road injuries not only fell in relative rank (from 
5th to 8th), but also saw significant decreases in all-age 
YLL rates and age-standardised YLL rates by 2040. 
Conversely, self-harm somewhat rose in relative rank 
(from 14th to 11th), though this was mainly driven by 
faster projected reductions for several CMNN causes 
ranked above self-harm in 2016.
Despite marked reductions in the leading causes of 
under-5 deaths from 1990–2016, our 2040 worse health 
scenarios suggest that such gains could be undone in the 
future (figure 5). Based on the reference forecast, 
2·1 million (95% UI 1·6–2·7) under-5 deaths were projected 
to occur in 2040, a 57·2% (44·8–67·1) decrease from 2016 
(ie, 5·0 million [4·7–5·2]). The most pronounced decreases 
in under-5 deaths were forecasted for LRIs, malaria, and 
neonatal disorders due to preterm birth complications. 
Conversely, far less progress was projected for neonatal 
sepsis and menin 
gitis under the reference forecast. In 
considering 2040 scenarios, three causes—LRIs, neonatal 
sepsis, and meningitis—showed the potential for equalling 
or exce 
eding their toll in 2016 under the 2040 worse health 
scenario. In absolute terms, this was particularly evident 
for LRIs, with the worse health scenario resulting in 661 000 
(233 000–1 173 000) under-5 LRI deaths in 2040. Yet, if all 
countries could meet the pace of progress established by 
the better health scenario, under-5 deaths from LRIs could 
decrease to 115 000 (43 100–264 000) in 2040.
Charting how changes in underlying risks could 
contribute to higher or lower rates of premature mortality 
across health scenarios showed the large potential for 
improving future health outcomes by intervening on 
modifiable risk factors today (figure 6). In 2040, our 
reference forecasts pointed to three metabolic risks—
high blood pressure, high BMI, and high FPG—as 
among the five leading global risk factors for YLLs. 
Differences between risk-attributable YLLs in the better 
and worse health scenarios were at least 2·6-times for 
these leading metabolic factors, a trend driven by massive 
variation in YLLs from cardiovascular diseases. Tobacco, 
the fourth-leading risk factor in 2040, showed a similarly 
large range across scenarios, reflecting the equally 
variable past trends in smoking across countries. In fact, 
based on the 2040 worse health scenarios, tobacco could 
eclipse high BMI and high FPG to become the 2nd

leading risk factor behind high blood pressure. Other 
risks for which the range in risk-attributable YLLs 
spanned more than 50 million across better and worse 
health scenarios included high total cholesterol, ambient 
particulate matter pollu 
tion, household air pollution, 
alcohol use, and several dietary risks. Short gestational 
age, ranked as the 9th leading risk factor for attributable 
YLLs in 2040, was the only risk among the leading ten 
that mainly affected CMNN diseases. Note that differences 
in risk-attributable YLLs between reference and scenarios 
for each risk must be interpreted with the shift of all risk 
factors and drivers of mortality set to better or worse 
health, not just the risk in question.
Super-region and regional findings
Figure 7 shows the evolution of YLLs, as categorised by 
CMNN, NCDs, and injuries, in the past and across 2040 
projections globally and regionally. While the shift from 
CMNN to NCD YLLs was evident across GBD super-
regions, the magnitude by which such epidemiological 
transitions varied. The most pronounced changes were 
forecasted in south Asia, as well in much of Latin 
America and southeast Asia, east Asia and Oceania, 
and North Africa and the Middle East. By contrast, 
high-income countries had comparatively smaller 
shifts, because such trans 
itions occurred before these 
periods. By 2040, despite some forecasted changes in 
burden composition, sub-Saharan Africa still had a 
greater share of YLLs from CMNN causes than NCDs.
By GBD region, how forecasted changes in cause-
specific mortality affected life expectancy varied by the 
reference (figure 8A), better health scenario (8B), and 
worse health scenario (8C). For the reference, western 
sub-Saharan Africa, central sub-Saharan Africa, and 
eastern sub-Saharan Africa recorded the largest projected 
gains by 2040, whereas as higher-income regions—which 
already achieved rel 
atively high life expectancies in 
2016—were forecast to have the smallest improvements. 
Although some regional convergence occurred, by 2040, 
an 18-year gap in life expectancy remained between 
Oceania and high-income Asia Pacific. Under the better 
health scenario, a greater chance for global convergence 
on life expectancy emerged, with the gap between the 
highest and lowest regional life expectancies decreasing 
to 13·2 years (95% UI 10·8–15·5). Larger declines in 
cardiovascular diseases across regions, faster reductions 
in many CMNN causes, and minimal increases in causes 
like diabetes underpinned the regional differences in 
forecasted life expectancies in the reference and better 
health scenario. Conversely, the combination of

Figure 6: Leading 20 risk factors contributing to the global difference in risk-attributable YLLs between the 2040 reference forecast, 2040 better health 
scenario, and 2040 worse health scenario
The differences between reference and better and worse health scenarios are grouped by Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) Level 2 causes attributable to risks, 
which are colour coded to correspond with the causes contributing to the change in years of life lost (YLLs) between scenarios for each risk factor. Black solid vertical 
lines represent all-cause attributable YLLs in the 2040 reference forecast, red dashed vertical lines represent all-cause attributable YLLs in the 2040 worse health 
scenario, and green dashed vertical lines all-cause attributable YLLs in the 2040 better health scenario.
worsening risk trends and slowed gains in economic 
growth, education, and reductions in total fertility rate 
under 25 years could culminate in reversals in life ex-
pectancy improvements and widen regional gaps to 
28·2 years (22·5–36·3). This potential was particularly 
striking in southern sub-Saharan Africa, where the 
rebound of HIV under the worse health scenario would 
lead to sizeable declines in life expectancy. Elsewhere, 
minimal progress against cardiovascular diseases 
contributed to slowed or negligible life expectancy gains.
Country-level findings
Based on the 2040 reference forecast, life expectancy for 
both sexes combined ranged from 57·3 years (95% UI 
48·7–65·3) in Lesotho to 85·8 years (83·6–87·4) in Spain 
(figure 9). By 2040, 59 countries were projected to meet or 
exceed a life expectancy of 80 years. Beyond most high-
income countries, such locations included those in Latin 
America (eg, Cuba, Peru, Colombia, and Chile), southeast 
Asia (eg, Thailand and Sri Lanka), and China. China 
surpassed a life expectancy of 80 years by 2040 (81·9 years 
[78·6–84·2]), and also recorded higher levels than 
the USA (79·8 years [76·3–82·9]). Russia, Tajikistan, 
Kazakhstan, and other central Asian countries all had 
forecasted life expectancy between 75 and 80 years by 
2040 while India and Pakistan were just below 75 years. 
Further, reference forecasts put several countries in 
sub-Saharan Africa on the trajectory to reach similar 
levels of life expectancy, including Rwanda (74·8 years 
[66·2–81·1]), Nigeria (74·8 years [71·5–78·3]), and Kenya 
(73·9 years [67·2–78·1]). In 2040, four countries in sub-
Saharan Africa were projected to have life expectancies 
less than 65 years (Central African Republic, Lesotho, 
Somalia, and Zimbabwe).
In terms of projected changes in life expectancy, 
reference 
forecasts 
unveiled 
striking 
geographic 
heterogeneities in much of the world by 2040 (figure 10). 
The largest absolute gains were primarily found in 
sub-Saharan Africa, with several countries recording 
projected gains of 9 years or higher (eg, Equatorial 
Guinea, Nigeria, Mali, and Mozambique). Some 
countries in south, southeast, and east Asia also saw 
substantive gains forecasted (eg, China, Indonesia, 
Laos), nearing or exceeding a gain of 5 years in 2040. 
Some countries in North Africa and the Middle East saw 
potential gains in forecasted lifespans; however, for a

subset of them, such as Syria, this was likely a reflection 
of marked life expectancy declines in the recent past 
due to its civil war and difficulties with accurately 
forecasting the effects of war in the future. Bolivia, 
Dominican Republic, Brazil, and Panama had among 
the highest forecasted life expectancy gains in Latin 
America and the Caribbean, each increasing average 
lifespans by at least 3 years by 2040. Among high-
income countries, most saw forecasted in 
creases of 1 to 
3 years in life expectancy by 2040; an exception was 
Portugal, which had a projected gain of 3·5 years 
(0·5–6·0) in the reference scenario. A map showing 
differences in country-level life expectancy across 2040 
scenarios is in appendix 2 (p 81).
Reference forecasts showed distinct geographic pat-
terns for the leading causes of YLLs in 2040, stressing 
the importance of charting country-level trajectories. 
Figure 11 presents global and regional findings, while 
country-level results can be found in appendix 2 
(pp 82–90). In 2040, 105 of 195 locations had ischaemic 
heart disease as the leading cause of YLLs, while stroke 
(in six countries) and diabetes (in 20 countries) were also 
among the leading NCDs for YLLs. Sub-Saharan Africa 
was the primary exception, where HIV
/AIDS, diarrhoeal 
diseases, and LRIs were projected to remain the main 
leading causes of YLLs in 2040. Nonetheless, ischaemic 
heart disease, stroke, and diabetes emerged as some of 
the leading ten causes of YLLs in western, southern, and 
eastern sub-Saharan Africa by 2040, portending a rise in 
the double burden of disease. Notably, Alzheimer’s 
disease also was among the leading three causes of 
YLLs for 39 locations in 2040, reflecting the effects of 
population ageing.
In southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, the projected 
toll of CMNN diseases generally receded as NCDs were 
forecasted to become the leading cause of YLLs by 2040. 
COPD surfaced as a leading cause of YLLs in most 
south Asian countries, generally out-ranking diabetes and 
Figure 7: Global and GBD super-region life expectancy and relative contribution of Level 1 GBD cause groups to total YLLs, 1980–2040, for the reference forecast scenario
Each ternary plot represents the relative contribution of years of life lost (YLLs) by Level 1 Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) cause group in a given year and changes in life expectancy over time as 
depicted by colour-coded circles sized relative to life expectancy. The closer each circle is to a given corner of the ternary plot—communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN), 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and injuries—the greater is the proportion of YLLs due to that Level 1 GBD cause. If CMNN, NCDs, and injuries contributed equally to YLLs (ie, each a third), 
the circle would be positioned in the middle of the ternary plot. LE=life expectancy.

chronic kidney disease by 2040. Beyond the burden of 
ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke projected for 
central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia, lung 
and colon cancers frequently ranked among the leading 
five causes of YLLs in 2040. For high-income countries, 
Alzheimer’s disease was the first-leading or second-
leading cause of YLLs in 24 locations by 2040. Within 
Latin America and the Caribbean, diabetes and chronic 
kidney disease were forecasted to rank alongside IHD as 
the leading causes of YLLs in 2040, followed by 
interpersonal violence as the 4th-leading cause of YLLs. 
In North Africa and the Middle East, road injuries were

forecasted to remain—or rise—as a leading cause of YLLs 
in many countries by 2040, ranking at least third in 11 of 
21 countries. Reference forecasts suggest that conflict and 
terrorism were likely to still incur high levels of YLLs in 
North Africa and the Middle East in 2040. Although 
CMNN diseases were forecasted to remain leading causes 
of YLLs in most sub-Saharan African countries, all 
45 countries included IHD as among the ten causes with 
the greatest toll in 2040. The reference forecast showed 
that diabetes could rank between the 2nd and 4th leading 
cause of YLLs in four countries in this region, although 
LRIs, HIV
/AIDS, and diarrhoeal diseases were pro 
jected 
to remain as the leading cause of premature mortality 
throughout southern sub-Saharan Africa in 2040.
By measuring gaps between reference forecasts and 
2040 better health scenarios for risk-attributable YLLs 
(figure 12), we could identify which modifiable risk factors 
offer the greatest opportunity for averting premature 
mortality in the future—if each country can move their 
health trajectories toward the better health scenario. 
Global and regional results are presented in figure 12, and 
country-level results are in appendix 2 (pp 58–68). Risk 
factors are ranked in accordance with the largest 
differences in attributable YLLs between the reference 
and better health scenarios, signalling which risks may 
be the best targets for investment today to have the 
largest impact on avoidable YLLs in the future. Out of 
195 countries and territories, 76 had high BMI as the 
leading risk for potentially avoidable YLLs by 2040, 
followed by 48 for tobacco, and 25 for high systolic blood 
pressure. For most locations, at least one of these risks 
ranked among the leading three priority targets; sub-
Saharan Africa was the main exception, where short 
gestational age, household air pollution, and child wasting 
were forecasted to have the among largest gaps between 
the reference and better health scenarios by 2040.
Overall, a combination of metabolic risk factors amen-
able to health care (ie, high blood pressure, high FPG, 
and high total cholesterol) and risks better addressed by 
public health policies and intersectoral action (ie, tobacco 
and high BMI) comprised the risk factors with the largest 
disparities in the reference and better health scenarios by 
2040. Divergent patterns emerged for some regions, 
demon 
strating the need to account for country-level risk 
profiles when planning for long-term intervention and 
policy. For instance, in southeast Asia, east Asia, and 
Oceania, ambient particulate matter pollution also had 
large gaps between reference forecast and 2040 better 
health scenarios, highlighting the importance of environ-
mental initiatives alongside mitigating leading metabolic

and behavioural risks. Alcohol use was consistently 
among the leading risks on this measure in central 
Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia, as well as 
many high-income countries. Metabolic risk factors, 
particularly high FPG, dominated Latin America and the 
Caribbean, while ambient particulate matter pollution 
and tobacco ranked among the leading risks for redress 
in North Africa and the Middle East. Among south Asian 
countries, ambient particulate matter pollution and 
tobacco also were among the leading ten risks for the 
gap between reference and better health scenarios. The 
risk profile for avoidable YLLs differed substantially for 
most sub-Saharan African countries, with many 
countries showing large potential for closing reference 
and better health scenario forecasts for unsafe water, 
sanitation, and hygiene; child wasting; and household 
air pollution. Metabolic risks like high FPG or high BMI 
did not rank among the five leading risks in many sub-
Saharan African countries, underscoring an unfinished 
agenda for risk factors associated with poverty and lower 
levels of SDI. In appendix 2 (pp 58–79), we report the 
country-level results for this analysis for both the gaps 
between the reference and better health scenario, and 
the equivalent gaps between the reference and worse 
health scenarios for risk-attributable YLLs, highlighting 
some of the largest threats for countries if they are 
unable to maintain their current trajectories. Country-
level fore 
casts by cause, as well as better and worse 
health scenarios through 2040, are in appendix 2 
(pp 91–2554).
Discussion
This was the first study to forecast a comprehensive set 
of cause-specific and all-cause mortality and associated 
indicators using a framework that allows for exploring 
different scenarios for many risk factors and other inde-
pendent drivers. In our reference scenario, life expec-
tancy was forecasted to continue increasing globally, and 
116 of 195 countries and territories were projected to 
have significant advances in life expectancy by 2040. 
Gains were projected to be faster among many low-to-
middle SDI countries, indicating that inequalities in life 
expectancy could narrow by 2040; nonetheless, reference 
forecasts still had life expectancy ranging from more 
than 85 years in four countries (Japan, Singapore, Spain, 
and Switzerland) to less than 60 years in the Central 
African Republic and Lesotho. Global and regional shifts 
in the proportion of YLLs caused by CMNN diseases 
toward NCDs were projected to continue into the future, 
the main exception being sub-Saharan Africa. For many

countries, the gaps between better and worse health 
scenarios for projected cause-specific mortality and risk-
attributable YLLs were massive, representing an equally 
wide range of future trajectories by 2040 with the 
potential 
for 
tremendous 
progress 
or 
alarming 
regression in health outcomes.
In the reference scenario, the global shift towards 
NCDs masks heterogeneous trends for different 
diseases. Globally, six of the leading ten causes of YLLs 
were CMNN diseases in 2016; four of these—HIV/
AIDS, neonatal disorders due to preterm birth 
complications, malaria, and neonatal encephalopathy—
were projected to fall below the leading 10 causes by 
2040. Total LRI YLLs conceal the marked shift projected 
to occur across age groups, particularly among older 
populations. Our forecasts of the rapid rise for several 
NCDs, including COPD, diabetes, chronic kidney 
disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and lung cancer, portend 
serious health system implications. To the extent that 
increasing YLLs signal rising disease occurrence and 
increased demand for health care, these shifts could 
have significant ramifi 
cations on the volume and type 
of health expenditure in many health systems. The 
changing nature of premature mortality also has 
implications for the curricula and specialties for health-
care professionals. These shifts evident at the global 
level are even more striking in some regions and 
countries such as India or Indonesia.
Our reference forecast was driven to an important 
extent by trends in the risk factors currently included in 
our model. We showed how selected risk factor forecasts 
and scenario selection play out in a single country in 
appendix 1 (p 22) and point to how the position of the 
forecast relative to scenarios varies among the risks. 
Globally, 43 drivers were forecasted to improve under 
the reference scenario and 36 were projected to worsen. 
Future trajectories were driven by the balance of these 
negative and positive forces. In nearly all locations BMI 
is worsening, and other drivers such as ambient air 
pollution, FPG, cholesterol, and some components of 
diet also were forecast to worsen in many places. Each

Figure 12: Ten leading risk factors contributing to the largest differences in 
risk-attributable YLLs between the 2040 reference forecast and 2040 better 
health scenario, globally and by GBD region
Values are reported in thousands. Risks are listed at the Global Burden of Disease 
Study (GBD) Level 3 risk hierarchy from GBD 2016, and are colour coded in 
accordance with their Level 1 categorisation (shading represents GBD Level 2 
cause hierarchy). YLLs=years of life lost.
location’s trends hinge upon whether progress in 
reducing risk for drivers such as tobacco or some dietary 
risks can counteract projected adverse trends, par-
ticularly for high BMI. When these trends were 
translated into attributable mortality in 2040, we found 
that four risks accounted for more than 100 million 
YLLs: three metabolic risk factors (high blood pressure, 
high BMI, and high FPG) and tobacco. In addition to 
these drivers’ effects in the reference scenario, a very 
wide range of attributable YLLs emerged between their 
better and worse health scenarios. Both the size of each 
risk’s attributable YLLs and range suggest that these 
factors should be the focus of policy attention and 
health-care prioritisation. For instance, there is an 
important role for expanding access to primary care and 
risk management for high blood pressure, FPG, and 
chol 
esterol; sub 
sequently, efforts to scale up universal 
health coverage may be one avenue for reducing the 
contribution of these risks in the future. High BMI, the 
second-leading future risk in the reference scenario, 
poses a more complex challenge; while policy options 
are available, their effect was less clear given that even 
the better health scenario showed rising burden 
attributable to high BMI. As demonstrated by the wide 
range in attributable YLLs due to tobacco and ambient 
particulate matter air pollution across 2040 scenarios, it 
is crucial to intensify and strengthen initiatives targeting 
tobacco and air pollution.
Based on our reference forecast, a subset of countries 
were projected to remain as low-income in 2040, and 
still experience relatively low educational attainment, 
life expectancy below 65 years, and YLLs dominated by 
CMNN diseases. Many different thresholds can be used 
to identify this set of countries which will continue not 
to enjoy the substantive gains in health outcomes 
observed in many other parts of the world. The exact 
thresholds are less important than the recognition that, 
based on past trends of independent drivers and 
continued relationships between these drivers and 
health outcomes, a set of countries, including the 
Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, and Somalia, will 
continue to be markedly disadvantaged. This phen-
omenon of the long tail of the distribution was evident 
in the better health scenario as well (eg, Lesotho was 
still projected to have a life expectancy less than 65 years 
under the better health scenario). Further, under 
the 2040 worse health scenario, global inequalities 
would substantially widen, with most of these most 
disadvantaged countries remaining in central and 
western sub-Saharan Africa and some in Oceania. This 
long tail has implications for development policy and 
the need to focus scarce resources toward these 
countries in an effort to accelerate progress.
Our 
forecasts 
suggest 
continued 
progress 
in 
improving life expectancy. These forecasts, however, do 
not account for the potential effects of climate change 
on life expectancy except as mediated through ambient 
air pollution. Predicted impacts in other studies on 
extreme weather-related deaths and heat wave deaths 
are not large enough to have much impact on global life 
expectancy. WHO estimated that climate change would 
cause 250 000 additional deaths each year by 2040.30,31 
Climate change, however, might have a much greater 
effect on survival on populations in some fragile 
environments mediated through reduced agricultural 
output and increased food insecurity. The pathway to 
large health effects could also be through conflicts and 
migration that might stem from severe food insecurity. 
These effects are extremely hard to model using 
statistical models fit to past data and will require other 
approaches to quantify their potential effect. Another 
risk for future health gains not incorporated in these 
forecasts is the potential rise of antimicrobial resistance, 
with some claims suggesting millions of deaths due to 
antimicrobial resistance.32,33 The validity of these claims, 
however, is not well established.34,35 We also did not 
forecast the potential effect of a major global influenza 
pandemic of the magnitude of the one occurring in 
1918; such a pandemic would substantially increase 
mortality in any given year.35 Although our forecasts 
currently do not reflect these potential negative risks, 
they also do not account for the potential for accelerated 
technical innovation, which could lead to striking 
breakthroughs in prevention or medical treat 
ment 
(eg, HIV vaccine, cure for cancer). For each cause of 
death, our models capture the global secular trend in 
the past 27 years and assume this secular trend 
continues in the future; in other words, we already 
assumed the disease-specific pace of innovation will 
continue. Yet breakthroughs for diseases for which 
minimal innovation has occurred during the past-
quarter century are not captured in these forecasts.
Taken together, our forecasts point to a world where 
most populations are living longer and many health 
improvements are likely to occur if current trajectories 
hold; at the same time, such gains are not without 
potential important social consequences, particularly 
if long-term planning and policy design are not fully 
considered today.36 Social security, pensions, and 
programmes specifically targeting the support of older 
populations have generally been most solvent when a 
greater proportion of people are contributing to these 
initiatives or are active in the workforce than the 
proportion of people who are immediately benefitting 
from them. Based our modelling framework, the 
demographic dynamics projected to unfold involve a

decrease in total fertility rate and steady shifts in 
population toward older ages, which also portends a 
larger overall volume of disease burden and expansion 
of morbidity in many places.6,37 Countries such as Japan 
have already experienced the economic toll and stress on 
social programmes that can occur when demography’s 
balancing act tilts toward older populations and younger 
cohorts struggle to fill the growing economical and 
financial gaps left behind as their elders retire. Similar 
concerns have been recently mounting in China,38,39 
and in the absence of deliberate action concerning 
programmes such as social security and pensions, it is 
likely that more countries will face these very complex 
demographic challenges in future.
An important finding is that in the reference scenario, 
we forecasted slower progress in 2040 than that achieved 
in the past; however, in the better health scenario, global 
life expectancy improvements exceeded gains that 
occurred from 1990–2016. This forecasted slowdown in 
the reference scenario is rooted in a combination of 
several factors. First, some risks were projected to 
worsen in the future, most notably high BMI. Second, 
past progress on other leading risk factors for premature 
mortality, namely tobacco and ambient particulate 
matter air pollution, was highly variable40 and thus such 
heterogeneity was projected through 2040. Third, 
several countries that have already achieved higher 
levels of life expectancy have also had stagnated gains.41,42 
Fourth, the relatively new occurrence observed in a 
number of high-income countries of increases in 
mortality in younger adults, particularly younger than 
50 years, was captured and propagated in our forecasts.43 
Last, such slowdowns might be related to how we 
capture the effect of innovation, or the inclusion of 
global secular trends by age that are supposed to capture 
changes in health not accounted for by measured risk 
factors, interventions, or SDI. An important part of this 
temporal trend might be due to innovations in medical 
and public health technologies and programmes; 
however, there might be important interactions between 
technological innovation and health system capacity to 
deliver such innovations that are not currently captured 
in our model.
Gaps between the better and worse health scenarios 
provide some quantification of the scope for policy 
impact on future health trajectories. To the extent that we 
believe the 85th and 15th percentile rates of change for 
each independent driver could occur in each country, 
even if we do not yet know the policy mix used to achieve 
this rate of change, then the wide range of outcomes 
between better and worse means that policy today can 
have a huge effect on the future. The future is not 
inevitable; funding of public health and medical care, 
social policy and multisectoral action for health can have 
profound effects on both short-term and long-term 
outcomes. We hope that the quantification of these 
scenarios will bring more attention to how different 
countries have achieved faster progress, and why some 
countries experience slower gains, for each of the 
independent drivers. Most importantly, our study shows 
that the future is highly malleable, but also requires 
concerted attention and continued priorisation of the key 
drivers of health.
Our choice of defining the better and worse health 
scenarios based on the 85th and 15th percentiles of rates 
of change is arbitrary. We could have selected more 
ambitious rates of change (ie, the 95th and fifth 
percentiles), as they also have been used in the past.44 We 
selected the 85th and 15th percentiles to balance the 
considerations of what is possible and replicable across 
many contexts, as well as the fact that achieving these 
percentiles for all drivers at once and consistently for 
24 years is quite unlikely by the laws of probability. 
Furthermore, the fact that annual rates of change for a 
risk factor or an intervention have been achieved in 
15% of countries does not mean that success can be 
replicated everywhere else. However, rates achieved in 
15% of countries are clearly not impossible and can serve 
as a guide for what is achievable.
These scenarios are meant to define the scope of what 
is generally possible. However, for specific drivers such 
as tobacco, there might also be value in analysing the 
effect of much faster rates of progress (ie, the 
99th percentile). The case of tobacco is illustrative, since 
only 20 countries had rates of change in the tobacco 
SEV between 1990 and 2016 faster than 2% (eg, the USA 
and Canada), so these tobacco policy success stories do 
not define the more conservative 85th percentile. We 
purposefully developed our forecasting models to 
support more detailed alternative scenarios for specific 
risks, with the ultimate goal of enabling any user to 
explore the effect of change on any independent driver at 
any given rate of change. Computational speed currently 
precludes such endless possibilities, but our modelling 
platform supports this future endeavour.
Before this study, most forecasting models of all-cause 
or cause-specific mortality used only one covariate, 
namely time. These trend-based models have the 
advantage of not needing to forecast time into the future 
and, depending on the formulation, they can produce 
reasonable out-of-sample predictive validity. The other 
tradition has been disease-specific or intervention-
specific modelling exercises to assess the effect of 
changing a singular independent driver in some 
alternative scenario. Such models have focused on 
capturing the causal connections between the driver 
and the outcome of concern, such as tobacco and lung 
cancer, rather than achieving good out-of-sample 
predictive validity. In this analysis, we captured the 
causal connections between 79 drivers and outcomes in 
addition to correlations between SDI and time with 
outcomes, and also achieved better out-of-sample pre-
dictive validity than previous efforts. We believe 
achieving reasonable out-of-sample predictive validity

and building a modelling framework that allows 
exploration of myriad combinations of independent 
drivers is highly useful for policy exploration and 
dialogue. Balancing these two objectives and producing 
coherent forecasts for all-cause and cause-specific 
mortality for a large number of causes has required 
constructing a complicated and interlocking modelling 
framework; however, such complexity is necessary to 
achieve the effective balance provided with this method.
For two causes of death, natural disasters and conflict, 
developing models with good predictive validity has 
been challenging. We explored published modelling 
strategies but they did not provide good out-of-sample 
predictive validity with our data.45 In the absence of 
more robust modelling strategies, we opted to use an 
overly simplified approach for the current analysis: 
sampling for each year in the future the location-
specific distribution of the event rate from 1950–2016. 
In settings of extreme events, such as the Haiti 
earthquake of 2010 that effectively means the average 
for the future in those countries is 1/67th of the extreme 
event occurring in each year in the future. The simple 
nature of our models for these two causes must be 
considered when interpreting results for locations 
which have experienced major events from 1950–2016. 
To date, however, we have not found a model with more 
predictive 
power 
than this relatively simplistic 
approach. Another important issue to note in our 
forecasts related to conflict is that migration is not 
endogenous to the model. We do not, for example, 
model increased migration in a draw of the future 
reference scenario that is higher when there is a 
conflict. Our migration data is based on the UN 
Population Division forecasts, which are not linked to 
any particular model of conflict in our simulations. 
This important limitation can only be addressed by 
building a model that predicts migration as a function 
of con 
flict, economic factors, and other contextual 
determin 
ants; additionally, modelling migration is 
known to be particularly challenging.46,47
In the reference scenario, our forecasts include 
underlying mortality rates and global effects of time 
interacted with each 5-year age-group. This temporal 
trend component of the underlying model was meant to 
capture trends across countries for a given cause that 
were not captured by risk factors or SDI. Technical 
innovation is an important component of this temporal 
trend as are other social policy innovations and trends in 
risks not currently included in GBD. Although the 
average pace of technical innovation from 1990–2016 was 
captured, our model did not explicitly map out the 
probability of particular technical breakthroughs. For 
example, our road-injury estimates account for the trends 
related to SDI, but do not capture the potentially large 
effects of self-driving or driver-assisted car technology.48,49 
Any future technical innovations that could contribute to 
accelerated or abrupt declines in mortality, such as the 
advent of ART for HIV in 1996, were not captured in the 
reference scenario. Simulations of the potential effect of 
major innovations, whether drugs, vaccines, or broader 
technical innovation, can use the reference scenario as 
the com 
parator against which the effect of these 
developments can be assessed.
A key aspect of our forecasting model was to capture 
causal relations between the independent drivers and 
mortality so that we could explore alternative scenarios 
from different settings of drivers. The causal relations 
between risk factors and cause-specific mortality builds 
on the comparative risk factor assessment in GBD 
2016. This evidence synthesis also accounts for 
mediation of the effect of risks through others (ie, the 
effect of BMI on mortality from ischaemic heart disease 
through high systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, and 
FPG).16 For the components of SDI (income per person, 
educational attainment, and total fertility rate under 
25 years), we clearly cannot, with the modelling 
framework used here, claim that this study has 
demonstrated causality for these three variables. 
However, findings from some published studies 
support causal connections between all three and many 
health outcomes.50–53 Given that the total fertility rate 
under 25 years in SDI is used a proxy measure of 
women’s empowerment, the question is whether the 
associations for causes other than maternal and child 
health outcomes is causal. We clearly cannot prove that 
they are but believe they are credibly causal given the 
mechanisms through which women’s empowerment 
might influence many causes.
In this analysis, we developed a modelling framework 
that produced estimates for all-cause and cause-specific 
mortality, used 79 covariates as independent drivers, 
and for risk factors and interventions produced results 
consistent with evidence on causality from cohort 
studies and randomised trials. In addition to preserving 
the causal relationships between independent drivers 
and their potential effects on future health, our overall 
results achieved good out-of-sample predictive validity 
compared with other simpler modelling strategies. 
There are many opportunities to further refine the 
modelling strategy. As more time series for intervention 
coverage are made available, we also can add more 
interventions as part of the risk factor and intervention-
attributable component of the model. In the better and 
worse health scenarios, we did not explicitly preserve 
the observed covariance between different independent 
drivers; however, this kind of relationship could be 
built into our modelling strategy. The costs of moving 
from reference forecasts to better health scenarios 
for the independent drivers were not included in 
the current analysis. Combining forecasts of health 
expenditures, health system efficiency, and estimates 
of costs could produce better forecasts of the indepen-
dent drivers of health and support analyses on the 
optimum allocation of resources on a dollar per

disability-adjusted life-year basis in the future. Based 
on the current model, by optimising the computational 
engine, we could allow users to explore an essentially 
limitless combination of different trajectories for the 
risk factors, income per person, educational attainment, 
and met need for family planning. Such user-driven 
scenario construction should prove a useful input 
for policy dialogues in many settings, allowing 
rapid generation of the effect of changing individual 
risk factors or com 
binations of risks with different 
socioeconomic contexts. In our forecasts we noted 
larger increases in number of deaths compared to YLLs. 
This was partly due to how we computed YLLs with the 
GBD 2016 reference life table, kept constant into the 
future. In coming forecasting iterations we will 
consider revision of our current YLL standard to reflect 
expected progress in the best observed age-specific 
death rates.
Limitations
Any forecasting study is subject to several limitations. 
Many factors, which were not included in our models, 
could change the nature of future health; consequently, 
any forecasting effort must acknowledge that this task is 
extremely challenging. Although our model performed 
well out-of-sample for 2007–16 fit to data for the 
period 1990–2006, similar model performance is not 
guaranteed in the future. Second, our models for 
forecasting in 
dependent drivers of health were relatively 
simple extrapolations of past trends weighted, to some 
degree, for recency. Our forecasts were limited by the 
validity of these simple extrapolations, even though 
they also had reasonable out-of-sample predictive per-
for 
mance. Third, our model deviated from demographic 
tradition, wherein only past trends were used to 
extrapolate to the future (ie, time is the sole independent 
driver). Proponents of this approach and its many 
variants argue they have better out-of-sample predictive 
validity than models that in 
corporate causal connections. 
With the present study, we achieved comparatively 
good, out-of-sample predictive performance while incor-
porating causal relationships where they have been 
established (eg, for tobacco and ischaemic heart 
disease). Fourth, our analysis of the components for 
each cause of death currently unex 
plained by risk 
factors was complicated by high co-linearity between 
the secular trend, income per person, educational 
attain 
ment, and total fertility rate under 25 years. To 
address this co-linearity, the regressions used SDI, a 
reduced form of the three variables. Fifth, our better and 
worse health scenarios had comparatively small 
variations in total fertility rate under 25 years for many 
locations, which resulted from having the effect of 
better and worse health scenarios operate through 
changes in female education and met need for family 
planning. Other unexplained drivers of fertility change 
were not reflected in these scenarios. Sixth, we did not 
model migration related to conflict, natural disasters, or 
other catastrophic events. More generally, improved 
modelling of migration and refugees would be an 
important area of improvement for our population 
forecasting. Seventh, we modelled each sex separately, a 
decision informed by issues that arise in many 
extrapolation models where estimates are modelled for 
single sex and then the sex ratios for mortality.54 We did 
not impose any relationship regarding male-female 
differences in age-specific mortality or life expectancy; 
notably, we did not forecast any reversals where male 
life expectancy exceeded that of females in 2040. Finally, 
to capture the causal relations between risks and cause-
specific mortality it is important that patterns of 
mediation of risks through other risks are identified and 
correctly quantified. GBD offers comprehensive and 
systematic efforts to use mediation adjustments in 
its risk factor analysis. Since many mediation path-
ways remain un 
known and others poorly quantified, 
our mediation matrix might not be fully accurate. 
However, despite limitations with the mediation matrix, 
our model’s performance still exceeds that of methods 
like Lee-Carter,26 which do not incorporate risk factors 
at all. 
Conclusion
With this study, we offer a robust yet flexible forecasting 
platform from which future health scenarios can be 
examined across countries and over time; a crucial 
resource for long-term health planning and investments. 
Based on our reference forecast, health outcomes were 
generally predicted to improve through 2040; however, 
as shown by the 2040 better and worse health scenarios, 
ample room exists for both substantial progress 
and the reversal of health gains. The intersection of 
deliberate policy action, technological innovation, and 
careful attention to rising environmental, social, and 
geopolitical risks will likely shape the range of possible 
health trajectories in the future. The considerable range 
between better and worse health scenarios, even when 
accounting for 79 health drivers, shows the important 
role of policy change in improved health for the next 
generation. Decision makers in most countries ought to 
plan for a continued shift towards NCDs and target 
resources to the leading risk factors sensitive to policy 
change or health care, such as high blood pressure, 
high FPG, high BMI, tobacco, ambient air pollution, 
and diet. In the absence of major medical advances, 
CMNN causes are likely to remain dominant health 
challenges among the poorest countries, and there is a 
real risk that the HIV epidemic could rebound in 
many countries if progress is not maintained. Continued 
technical innova 
tion and heightened spending on 
health, inclusive of development assistance for health, 
will be necessary to prevent millions of people from 
living in substantially worse conditions than the rest of 
the world.
