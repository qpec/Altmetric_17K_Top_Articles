ZIKV is an arbovirus that belongs to the family flaviviridae and is trans-
mitted to man by Aedes mosquitos1. ZIKV was first isolated from a 
sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947 and has 
subsequently been found in mosquitos and humans1. Until recently, 
ZIKV was not viewed as a particularly important pathogen, as the 
majority of infections are asymptomatic2. Symptomatic cases of ZIKV 
resemble mild cases of dengue fever, with fever, myalgia, arthralgia, 
headache, conjunctivitis and rash3.
Until recently, cases were sporadic, largely in Africa and Southeast 
Asia, and epidemic activity had not been observed1. A large outbreak of 
ZIKV occurred on Yap island in the Western Pacific in 2007, then spread 
through Oceania and reached Brazil in 2015, where it rapidly spread to 
other South American countries1,4–7.
It is now apparent that ZIKV infection can cause substantial neuro-
logical complications; an increase in cases of Guillain Barré syndrome 
was first reported following the outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013 
(ref. 8). Dramatic increases in the incidence of microcephaly originating 
in northeastern Brazil were reported in late 2015, coincident with a large 
increase in ZIKV infection9,10. These increases in Guillain Barré syn-
drome and microcephaly led the World Health Organization to declare 
ZIKV a public health emergency in February 2016 (ref. 11).
ZIKV can be carried by a variety of Aedes mosquitos, but the princi-
pal species responsible for the current outbreaks is thought to be Aedes 
aegypti1,3. In parts of Brazil, A. aegypti is also spreading DENV and 
chikungunya viruses concurrently with ZIKV12–17. In the past 20 years, 
DENV has spread through areas of South America, and the seroprev-
alence of DENV in some areas affected by ZIKV exceeds 90% (refs. 
18–20).
DENV exists as four serotypes that differ by 30–35%, and the DENV 
serocomplex in turn differs from ZIKV by 41–46% (in amino acid 
sequence of the envelope protein)21. Published reports have shown 
difficulty in distinguishing DENV infection versus ZIKV infection 
serologically, indicative of a degree of antigenic similarity between the 
viruses4,22,23.
Following a primary DENV infection, a person develops life-long 
immunity to the infecting serotype but not to the other serotypes24,25. 
In DENV-endemic areas, all four serotypes of DENV frequently circu-
late together or cyclically replace each other, which means that multiple 
sequential infections are common26. One of the interesting features of 
DENV infection is that the life-threatening complications that lead to 
dengue hemorrhagic fever are more common after secondary infection 
than after primary infection21. One theory to explain this is ADE21. The 
ADE hypothesis suggests that antibodies generated during a primary 
infection with DENV will not be of sufficient concentration or avidity 
to neutralize a secondary infection with DENV of a different serotype 
that differs in amino acid sequence by 30–35%. However, they might

Zika virus (ZIKV) was discovered in 1947 and was thought to lead to relatively mild disease. The recent explosive outbreak of 
ZIKV in South America has led to widespread concern, with reports of neurological sequelae ranging from Guillain Barré syndrome 
to microcephaly. ZIKV infection has occurred in areas previously exposed to dengue virus (DENV), a flavivirus closely related to 
ZIKV. Here we investigated the serological cross-reaction between the two viruses. Plasma immune to DENV showed substantial 
cross-reaction to ZIKV and was able to drive antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of ZIKV infection. Using a panel of human 
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to DENV, we showed that most antibodies that reacted to DENV envelope protein also reacted to 
ZIKV. Antibodies to linear epitopes, including the immunodominant fusion-loop epitope, were able to bind ZIKV but were unable 
to neutralize the virus and instead promoted ADE. Our data indicate that immunity to DENV might drive greater ZIKV replication 
and have clear implications for disease pathogenesis and future vaccine programs for ZIKV and DENV.

hospital. Samples were collected between 2002 and 2004 (Table 1); at this 
time, ZIKV was not described in the Khon Kaen region. Plasma collected 
from subjects around 6 months following secondary infection with DENV 
serotypes 1–4 was assessed for its binding to ZIKV and DENV by capture 
ELISA. In all cases, DENV-immune plasma bound to both DENV and 
ZIKV (Fig. 1). The overall patterns of binding to ZIKV strains originating 
in Africa (HD78788) or French Polynesia (PF13) were similar (Fig. 1).
Next we assessed neutralization of ZIKV by plasma collected from 
DENV-infected subjects during the convalescent phase. All such plasma 
was able neutralize DENV nearly 100% at the lowest dilution used (1:50) 
(Fig. 2a). However, neutralization of ZIKV was considerably less effi-
cient, with most plasma samples showing no appreciable neutralization 
at a dilution of 1:50 (Fig. 2b). The three samples that showed appreciable 
neutralization of ZIKV HD78788 were among the strongest neutralizers 
of DENV (Fig. 2b). The finding that plasma containing antibodies to 
DENV substantially cross-reacted with ZIKV prompted us to determine 
whether it was able to promote ADE.
DENV plasma potently induces ADE
We assessed the ability of plasma from DENV-infected subjects to pro-
mote ADE in the human myeloid cell line U937, which is relatively resis-
tant to infection by DENV in the absence of ADE31. Here, we found that 
U937 cells were also poorly permissive to ZIKV
, with infection of <0.6% 
of cells in the absence of ADE (Fig. 3a). ZIKV was pre-incubated with 
a titration of pooled serum collected from convalescent subjects at 1–2 
weeks after recovery from infection with DENV and was then used to 
infect U937 cells. Pooled serum from convalescent subjects led to sub-
stantial enhancement (>100-fold) of infection of cells by ZIKV strains 
PF13 and H78788 (Fig. 3b). As expected, plasma pooled from control 
subjects not infected with DENV did not enhance such infection (Fig. 3b). 
Next we assessed a panel of convalescent plasma collected from subjects 
around 6 months following acute secondary infection with DENV
. In all 
but one case, plasma from DENV-infected subjects enhanced the infection 
of cells with ZIKV
, with a median increase of 12-fold for infection by the 
HD78788 strain of ZIKV (Fig. 3c,d). In summary, these results demon-
strated that cross-reacting antibodies to DENV were able promote ADE 
of ZIKV infection but were poorly neutralizing.
Cross-reaction of mAbs to DENV
We used a previously created a panel of human mAbs that react to the 
DENV envelope protein, generated from plasmablasts isolated from 
DENV-infected patients27. Detailed epitope mapping of these anti-
bodies has demonstrated three broad reactivities. Around one third of 
the antibodies react to the well-described fusion-loop epitope (FLE), 
and another one third have not been definitively mapped but, like the 
 
still opsonize the secondary virus and target it for Fc-receptor-mediated 
endocytosis into myeloid cells such as monocytes and macrophages 
(which are the principal site of DENV replication) and thus drive higher 
viral loads. ADE can be readily demonstrated in vitro and has also be 
shown to drive higher viral loads of DENV in animal models27–30.
Here we took advantage of a panel of human mAbs generated from 
DENV-infected subjects to demonstrate substantial cross-reactivity 
between DENV and ZIKV. Most mAbs to DENV also bound to ZIKV, 
but those that recognize the major linear fusion-loop epitope (FLE) did 
not neutralize ZIKV, whereas they showed neutralizing activity against 
DENV
. DENV-immune plasma and mAbs to DENV potently enhanced 
ZIKV infection, which suggests the possibility that preexisting immunity 
to DENV might increase ZIKV replication.
RESULTS
DENV plasma cross-reacts with ZIKV
We studied a cohort previously established to investigate DENV infection 
in children in Khon Kaen in northeast Thailand. After informed consent 
was obtained, subjects were enrolled in the study; plasma and periph-
eral blood mononuclear cells were collected during their hospital stay 
for the acute phase of the illness, and samples were also collected during 
the convalescent phase, around 6 months following discharge from the

antibodies to EDE are fully cross-reactive to all four DENV serotypes 
and are able to broadly neutralize infection in the picomolar range27 .
Binding of the panel of mAbs to DENV to ZIKV was assessed by 
capture ELISA and compared with their binding to DENV (Fig. 4a). The 
profile of their binding to the African (HD78788) and French Polynesian 
(PF13) strains of ZIKV was highly similar; all of the mAbs to FLE cross-
antibodies to FLE, they react to envelope protein, by immunoblot 
analysis (called ‘non-FLE’ here, as the antibodies are not sensitive to 
substitution of residue Trp101 of the envelope protein)27. A group of 
around 50 antibodies do not react to envelope protein, by immunoblot 
analysis, and bind only to intact viral particles27. These antibodies have 
been shown by cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography to 
bind to a conformational quaternary epitope formed at the interface 
of two envelope protein monomers that make 
up the basic head-to-tail dimer, 90 of which are 
arranged in icosahedral symmetry into the DENV 
glycoprotein shell27,32. This new epitope has been 
called the ‘envelope dimer epitope’ (EDE) and 
is subdivided this into two groups, EDE1 and 
EDE2, on the basis of sensitivity to removal of the 
N-linked glycan at Asn153 in the envelope protein 
(the binding of mAbs to EDE2 is diminished by

also promoted ADE of ZIKV infection when added at sub-neutralizing 
concentrations, although peak enhancement was seen with lower con-
centrations than the concentrations of mAb to FLE required for peak 
enhancement. This demonstrated that mAbs isolated from DENV-
infected patients, with different specificities, had broad cross-reactivity 
to ZIKV.
mAbs to EDE can inhibit ADE of DENV plasma
FLE and EDE are overlapping epitopes, as the footprint of the EDE also 
covers the fusion-loop region32. To investigate whether mAbs to DENV 
could overcome ADE induced by serum containing polyclonal antibod-
ies to DENV, we added a titration of mAbs to DENV to ZIKV incu-
bated with an enhancing concentration of serum containing antibodies 
to DENV, then assessed the infection of U937 cells. mAbs to FLE had 
no effect, whereas the mAbs to EDE1, except 752-2B2 (which has lower 
reacted with ZIKV
, and 36 of 37 of mAbs to non-FLE cross-reacted with 
ZIKV, whereas the cross-reaction of the mAbs to EDE1 or EDE2 was 
variable, with 27 of 33 mAbs to EDE1 binding to ZIKV
, and 8 of 17 mAbs 
to EDE2 binding to ZIKV (Fig. 4a). Binding curves showed lower avidity 
of binding of ZIKV by mAbs to EDE2 versus binding by mAbs to EDE1 
and lower avidity of mAb 752-2B2 (to EDE1) (Fig. 4b).
It has been demonstrated that almost all mAbs generated against 
DENV promote ADE, and this includes all of the human mAbs tested 
before27. Because the mAbs to DENV cross-reacted with ZIKV
, we next 
assessed the ability of mAbs to DENV to promote ADE of the infec-
tion of U937 cells by ZIKV. First, we tested three mAbs to FLE that 
showed no neutralization activity against ZIKV33. All of these antibodies 
promoted ADE, enhancing infection of the HD78788 strain by 39- to 
91-fold relative to the infection of this strain of ZIKV incubated with no 
antibody (Fig. 5). As expected, the ZIKV-neutralizing mAb to EDE33

ZIKV epidemic, this still translates to large number of cases8. Much work 
still needs to be performed to elucidate the exact causes of the micro-
cephaly; however, it is becoming increasingly clear that this is caused 
by intrauterine infection of the developing brain10,34–37. ZIKV has been 
shown in animal models to infect the placenta and stunt growth and is 
also able to cross the placenta and infect the brain38–40. Furthermore, 
in vitro, ZIKV can infect neural cell cultures and disrupt development 
in neurospheres41,42. The exact risk of neurological damage following 
avidity for ZIKV), were able to 
potently inhibit ADE of infection 
with the PF13 strain of ZIKV, 
with 50% inhibition occurring 
at titers of 0.091 ± 0.007 mg/ml 
(for mAb 752-2C8) and 0.034 ± 
0.006 mg/ml (for mAb 753(3)
C10) (Fig. 6). The mAbs to 
EDE2 of lower avidity for ZIKV 
than that of the mAbs to EDE1 
were not able to inhibit ADE in 
this assay. These studies demon-
strated that antibodies to EDE1 
potently inhibited ADE of infection with ZIKV and that when present 
at sufficient concentrations, they were protective in vivo.
DISCUSSION
The recent explosion of ZIKV infection in South America, with associ-
ated Guillain Barré syndrome and microcephaly, is of great concern8–10. 
Guillain Barré syndrome is a relatively rare complication, estimated to 
affect 0.024% of ZIKV-infected people, but owing to the scale of the

and had been primed by but not protected by the vaccine. For this rea-
son, the vaccine is not licensed for use in children under 9 years of age 
and, furthermore, it is recommended that it be used only in populations 
in which the seroprevalence of prior DENV exposure in the age group 
to be vaccinated is 70% or greater47.
There is now great pressure to produce a vaccine against ZIKV, and 
in this context, the extensive serological cross-reaction between DENV 
and ZIKV must be considered. It is likely that the vaccine will need to 
be deployed in areas with high seroprevalence for DENV, and raising de 
novo ZIKV-neutralizing responses in such a setting might be challeng-
ing. There is also the possibility that vaccination of DENV-naive subjects 
against ZIKV might promote ADE of DENV infection and, conversely, 
that vaccination against DENV might promote ADE of ZIKV infection.
The results described here have shown a complex serological interac-
tion between DENV and ZIKV. The precise reason for the explosion of 
ZIKV infection and its complications in Brazil will need to be fully deter-
mined, but it is possible that preexisting immunity to DENV is driving 
greater ZIKV replication in ZIKV-infected people, which might in turn 
create a greater risk of complications following infection and transmis-
sion of ZIKV to mosquitoes. The possibility that ADE of infection might 
aid the transplacental transfer of ZIKV also needs to be investigated. The 
timing of DENV infection versus that of ZIKV infection might also be 
important, as cross-reactive protective and enhancing immunity might 
change over time following DENV infection.
In summary, although ZIKV differs from DENV by around 41–46% 
(in the sequence of the envelope protein), the similarities are sufficient 
to allow cross-reaction of antibodies to DENV with ZIKV and to drive 
ADE of infection. In this context, ZIKV could be considered a fifth 
member of the DENV serocomplex, a factor that must be considered in 
vaccine approaches to these two viruses.

maternal infection remains to be determined, but early studies suggest 
that this risk may be up to 22% in the first trimester, although other 
reports from the French Polynesia put the risk at around 1% (refs. 43,44).
ZIKV is spread by Aedes mosquitos, and in South America, these 
mosquitos are now also promoting epidemic spread of DENV and chi-
kungunya viruses12. In many areas affected by ZIKV, seropositivity for 
DENV is very high, and in such areas there is great difficulty in distin-
guishing ZIKV infection versus DENV infection serologically19,20,23. In 
this paper, we have demonstrated substantial cross-reactivity of the anti-
DENV serological response toward ZIKV
. Most plasma containing anti-
bodies to DENV poorly neutralized ZIKV but potently induced ADE. 
However, some plasma samples from DENV-infected subjects showed 
appreciable neutralization of ZIKV: one sample neutralized the PF13 
strain, and three samples neutralized the HD78788 strain. Although it 
is not formally possible to exclude the possibility of previous exposure of 
these subjects to ZIKV
, there were no reports of ZIKV in the Khon Kaen 
region in 2002–2004, when the samples were collected; it is more likely 
they had higher circulating concentrations of cross-reactive neutralizing 
antibodies to DENV and ZIKV, such as those that recognize the EDE1 
epitope33. It is noteworthy that the three plasma samples that showed 
appreciable neutralization of ZIKV were among the four most potent 
DENV-neutralizing plasma samples.
A related paper has analyzed the neutralization of ZIKV by human 
mAbs to DENV33. Interestingly, antibodies to FLE, which form a major 
part of the antibody response in DENV infection21 and which, as shown 
here, promoted ADE, failed to neutralize infection33. Antibodies that 
react to FLE are known to be broadly reactive across flaviviruses; how-
ever, although often strong cross-reaction is measured by ELISA, these 
antibodies rarely show cross-neutralizing activity, perhaps because their 
epitopes are poorly exposed on native virus particles45. In addition, mAbs 
to EDE1 show potent neutralization of ZIKV in a picomolar range simi-
lar to the range found for neutralization of DENV
, while mAbs to EDE2 
also neutralize ZIKV but not as potently as mAbs to EDE1 do27,33. Those 
results are presented together with X-ray crystallographic structures of 
the antigen-binding fragments of EDE1 and EDE2 in complex with the 
ZIKV envelope protein33. During the preparation of this manuscript, a 
report investigating the cross-reactivity of antibodies to DENV with ZIKV 
was released46. Those authors describe cross-reaction of DENV-immune 
serum with ZIKV and demonstrate that two human mAbs to FLE are able 
to enhance ZIKV infection but do not cause neutralization.
ADE was first recognized nearly 50 years ago in DENV infection and 
is believed to be one of the factors that drive increased severity of sec-
ondary infections, which is a hallmark of DENV29. The risk of ADE has 
made the development of vaccines against DENV particularly difficult. 
The most advanced vaccine against DENV
, Dengvaxia (chimeric yellow 
fever–DENV tetravalent dengue vaccine; produced by Sanofi Pasteur) 
has just been licensed in several countries and gives some protection 
from infection; it is estimated that it will reduce the burden of disease by 
10–30% over a 30-year period if deployed in DENV-endemic countries47.
Dengvaxia is a tetravalent live attenuated vaccine in which sequences 
encoding the precursor membrane protein and envelope proteins 
that make up the glycoprotein shell of the DENV are combined with 
sequences encoding the non-structural proteins of the attenuated vac-
cine against the 17D strain of yellow fever virus21. Dengvaxia seems to 
give protection to people who have been previously infected with DENV
, 
but its efficacy is lower when given to DENV-naive vaccinees21,47.
An analysis of the vaccine trials of Dengvaxia of longer term has raised 
some safety concerns21. In groups of patients under 9 years of age, hos-
pitalization from DENV infection was greater for vaccinated children 
than for the non-vaccinated control group. This might represent ADE 
of infection in children who at entry to the study trial were DENV naive

ONLINE METHODS
Samples. Blood samples were collected after written informed consent was 
obtained, with approval of the ethical committee of the Khon Kaen and Siriraj 
Hospitals in Thailand and the Riverside Ethics Committee in UK. The serotypes 
of DENV infection was determined by RT-PCR detection of the viral genome48. 
Samples were collected around 6 months after recovery from dengue illness 
(Table 1). Secondary DENV infection was classified based on the ratio of <1.8, 
anti-DENV IgM to anti-DENV IgG, measured by IgM and IgG capture ELISA48. 
The dengue disease severity was classified according to the WHO 1997 classifica-
tion. Pooled serum from convalescent subjects was obtained by combining serum 
taken from dengue-infected patients around 1–2 weeks after recovery. Plasma 
pooled from control subjects not infected with DENV was obtained from normal 
healthy subjects that had no detectable anti-DENV antibodies.
Cells, reagents and antibodies. Vero cells (a gift from Armed Forces Research 
Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS)), 293T cells and U937 cells were cul-
tured at 37 °C in MEM, DMEM and RPMI-1640, respectively. C6/36 cells (a gift 
from AFRIMS) were grown in Leibovitz L-15 at 28 °C. All medium contained 
10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml 
streptomycin. All cell lines were free from mycoplasma contamination.
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-conjugated anti-human IgG (A9544) and horse-
radish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG (P0214) were purchased from 
Sigma and Dako, respectively. Mouse mAb 4G2 to DENV envelope protein was 
a gift from AFRIMS. RPMI-1640 (R8758), DMEM (D5046), p-nitrophenylphos-
phate (PNPP, N2770-50), Bovine serum albumin (BSA, A7030), diaminobenzi-
dine (D5905), and polyethylenimine (408727; Sigma) were from Sigma. MEM 
(31095) and Leibovitz L-15 (11415) were from Gibco and UltraDOMA-PF (12-
727F) was from Lonza.
Viral stocks. All viruses were grown in C6/36 cells. A.S. provided ZIKV strain 
HD78788 (African strain). ZIKV strain PF13/251013-18 (PF13) was isolated 
from a patient during the ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013. DENV-1 
(Hawaii), DENV-2 (16681), and DENV-3 (H87) were gifts from AFRIMS. 
DENV-4 (1-0093) was isolated from a DENV-4-infected patient. Virus-
containing supernatants were clarified by centrifugation at 2,000 r.p.m. at 4 °C 
before being stored at –80 °C. Viral titers were determined by a focus-forming 
assays on Vero cells27. All viral stocks were free from mycoplasma contamination.
Expression of human mAbs to DENV envelope protein. A pair of plasmids 
containing heavy and light chains of IgG1 were co-transfected into 293T cells 
using the polyethylenimine method and cultured in protein-free media. Culture 
supernatant containing antibodies was harvested after 5 d.
Determination of ZIKV cross-reactivity of anti-DENV antibodies by ELISA. 
A MAXISORP immunoplate (442404; NUNC) was coated with 50μl of 5μg/ml 
of mouse antibody 4G2 to envelope protein (a mouse antibody to the fusion loop 
that cross-reacts with ZIKV). Plates were blocked with 3% BSA (A7030, Sigma) 
for 1 h, followed by incubation with viral supernatant. After 1 h, 10 mg/ml human 
mAbs to DENV or serially diluted plasma was added. The reaction was visual-
ized by ALP-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody at a 1:10,000 dilution (A9544; 
Sigma) and PNPP substrate (N2770, Sigma). Reactions were stopped with NaOH 
and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Endpoint titers (EPTs) were defined 
as reciprocal plasma dilutions that corresponded to two times the average OD 
values obtained with mock antigen.
Neutralization assay. The focus reduction neutralization assay (FRNT) was 
employed to determine the neutralizing potential of antibodies. Virus was incu-
bated with serial dilutions of antibodies or plasma samples for 1 h at 37 °C. The 
mixtures were then added to Vero cells and incubated for 2 d (for ZIKV) or 3 d 
(for DENV). Focus-forming assays were then performed as described27. Vero 
cells were stained with mAb 4G2 (to envelope protein; cell culture supernatant 
(a gift from AFRIMS)), followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse 
immunoglobulin at a 1:1,000 dilution (P0047; Sigma). The foci (infected cells) 
were visualized by adding the peroxidase substrate DAB (D5905, Sigma). The 
percentage focus reduction was calculated and 50% FRNT was calculated using 
the probit program from the SPSS package.
Antibody-dependent enhancement assay. Serially diluted mAb or plasma 
samples were incubated with virus at moi of 2 (ZIKV) or 5 (DENV) for 1 h at 37 
°C before adding to U937 cells. After incubation for 2 d (ZIKV) or 3 d (DENV), 
supernatants were harvested and viral titers determined by focus forming assays. 
Fold enhancement was calculated by comparison to viral titers in the presence 
or absence of antibody. For flow cytometry, infected U937 cells were fixed and 
permeabilized in 3.7% formaldehyde and 0.5% saponin, respectively. Intracellular 
staining was performed with 4G2 conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 at 4 °C for 30 
min. Infected cells were analyzed by BD FACSVerse.
ADE inhibition by human mAbs was performed by premixing pooled convales-
cent dengue hyper-immune serum at 1:10,000 dilution (a peak enhancing dilution) 
with serially diluted mAb before performing the ADE assay as described above.
