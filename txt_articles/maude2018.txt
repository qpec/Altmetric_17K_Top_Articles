BACKGROUND
In a single-center phase 1–2a study, the anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) 
T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel produced high rates of complete remission and was 
associated with serious but mainly reversible toxic effects in children and young 
adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
METHODS
We conducted a phase 2, single-cohort, 25-center, global study of tisagenlecleucel 
in pediatric and young adult patients with CD19+ relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL. 
The primary end point was the overall remission rate (the rate of complete remission 
or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) within 3 months.
RESULTS
For this planned analysis, 75 patients received an infusion of tisagenlecleucel and 
could be evaluated for efficacy. The overall remission rate within 3 months was 
81%, with all patients who had a response to treatment found to be negative for 
minimal residual disease, as assessed by means of flow cytometry. The rates of 
event-free survival and overall survival were 73% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
60 to 82) and 90% (95% CI, 81 to 95), respectively, at 6 months and 50% (95% CI, 
35 to 64) and 76% (95% CI, 63 to 86) at 12 months. The median duration of remis-
sion was not reached. Persistence of tisagenlecleucel in the blood was observed for 
as long as 20 months. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were suspected to be related 
to tisagenlecleucel occurred in 73% of patients. The cytokine release syndrome 
occurred in 77% of patients, 48% of whom received tocilizumab. Neurologic 
events occurred in 40% of patients and were managed with supportive care, and 
no cerebral edema was reported.
CONCLUSIONS
In this global study of CAR T-cell therapy, a single infusion of tisagenlecleucel 
provided durable remission with long-term persistence in pediatric and young 
adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL, with transient high-grade 
toxic effects. (Funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals; ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT02435849.)

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
T
isagenlecleucel (formerly CTL019), 
an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor 
(CAR) T-cell therapy, is under investigation 
in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell 
cancers, including B-cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL). Results from a single-center 
phase 1–2a study of tisagenlecleucel involving 
60 children and young adults with relapsed or 
refractory B-cell ALL that was conducted at the 
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania showed a rate of com-
plete remission of 93%.1 The cytokine release 
syndrome, a common adverse event associated 
with CAR T-cell therapies, occurred in 88% of pa-
tients and was effectively managed with supportive 
measures and anticytokine therapy, including the 
interleukin-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab.1 
Long-term disease control without additional ther-
apy and with persistence of tisagenlecleucel for 
up to 4 years has been observed.1,2
On the basis of these results, a phase 2 pivotal, 
multisite study of tisagenlecleucel was initiated. 
In this nonrandomized study of CAR T-cell ther-
apy, we used a global supply chain and included 
25 study sites in 11 countries across North Amer-
ica, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Here we report 
the results of a planned analysis of data from 
the study, including analyses of the efficacy, 
safety, and cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel in 
75 patients with at least 3 months of follow-up.
Methods
Study Design
We conducted a single-cohort, phase 2, multi-
center, global study of tisagenlecleucel in chil-
dren and young adults with relapsed or refrac-
tory B-cell ALL. To be eligible for participation 
in the study, patients had to be at least 3 years 
of age at screening and no older than 21 years of 
age at diagnosis and to have at least 5% lympho-
blasts in bone marrow at screening. Patients 
who had previously received anti-CD19 therapy 
were excluded (see the Methods section of the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org).
Tisagenlecleucel was generated ex vivo with 
the use of autologous T cells transduced with a 
lentiviral vector to express a CAR containing a 
CD3-zeta domain to provide a T-cell activation 
signal and a 4-1BB (CD137) domain to provide a 
costimulatory signal.3
The study was sponsored and designed by 
Novartis Pharmaceuticals and was approved by 
the institutional review board at each participat-
ing institution. Patients or their guardians pro-
vided written informed consent or assent. Data 
were analyzed and interpreted by the sponsor in 
collaboration with the authors, and all the au-
thors reviewed the manuscript and vouch for ac-
curacy and completeness of the data and analyses 
and for adherence of the study to the protocol, 
available at NEJM.org. The first author wrote the 
first draft of the manuscript in conjunction with 
authors from Novartis. All the authors contrib-
uted to the writing of the manuscript and ap-
proved the final version for submission. Medical 
editorial assistance was provided by editors whose 
work was financially supported by Novartis.
End Points
The primary end point was an overall remission 
rate higher than 20% (the null hypothesis). The 
overall remission rate was defined as the rate of 
a best overall response of either complete remis-
sion or complete remission with incomplete hema-
tologic recovery within 3 months, as assessed by 
an independent review committee on the basis of 
the results of laboratory testing of blood, bone 
marrow, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well 
as physical examination. Responses were required 
to be maintained for at least 28 days (see the 
Methods section in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Secondary end points included the rate of 
complete remission or complete remission with 
incomplete hematologic recovery with undetect-
able minimal residual disease (<0.01%) assessed 
by means of central multiparameter flow cytom-
etry, the duration of remission, event-free sur-
vival (i.e., the time from infusion to the earliest 
of the following events: no response, relapse be-
fore response was maintained for at least 28 days, 
or relapse after having complete remission or 
complete remission with incomplete hematologic 
recovery), overall survival, cellular kinetics, and 
safety. Additional details regarding the second-
ary end points are provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
The primary end point was evaluated in the full 
analysis set. We determined that a sample of 76 
patients receiving a tisagenlecleucel infusion 
would provide more than 95% power to reject

Tisagenlecleucel in B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia
the null hypothesis of an overall remission rate 
of 20% against the alternative hypothesis of an 
overall remission rate of 45% or higher at an 
overall one-sided significance level of 2.5%.
An interim analysis was planned after the 
first 50 patients who received a tisagenlecleucel 
infusion had completed 3 months of follow-up 
or discontinued participation in the study. The 
results with regard to the primary end point 
were considered to be significant in the interim 
analysis if the one-sided P value was lower than 
0.0057. Key secondary end points were tested 
sequentially (after the primary end point was 
significant) to control the overall alpha.
The results with regard to overall remission 
rate, response duration, event-free survival, over-
all survival, cellular kinetics, and safety that are 
presented in this report are from an updated 
analysis that included 75 patients who received 
tisagenlecleucel and had completed 3 months of 
follow-up or discontinued the study at an earlier 
point. For the time-to-event analyses, Kaplan–
Meier curves were used to estimate survival dis-
tributions after infusion. All statistical tests were 
performed with the use of SAS software, version 
9.4 (SAS Institute). Additional details regarding 
the statistical analysis are provided in the Sup-
plementary Appendix.
Results
Patients
Between April 8, 2015, and the data cutoff on 
April 25, 2017, a total of 107 patients were 
screened, and 92 were enrolled (Fig. 1). A total 
of 75 patients received an infusion of tisagenle-
cleucel, with a median time from enrollment 
to infusion of 45 days (range, 30 to 105). The 
median duration of follow-up among patients 
who received a tisagenlecleucel infusion was 
13.1 months. At enrollment, patients who received 
tisagenlecleucel had a median age of 11 years 
(range, 3 to 23), a median of 3 previous therapies 
(range, 1 to 8), and a median marrow blast per-
centage of 74% (range, 5 to 99); 46 patients 
(61%) had undergone previous allogeneic hemato-
poietic stem-cell transplantation (Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).

Figure 1. Screening, Enrollment, Treatment, and Follow-up.
The first patient’s first visit occurred on April 8, 2015. The median time from 
tisagenlecleucel infusion to data cutoff was 13.1 months. The reasons for 
patients not enrolling in the study after screening included not meeting the 
inclusion criteria or meeting the exclusion criteria (11 patients, including 
<5% blasts in the bone marrow in 8 patients), death before acceptance of 
the apheresis sample at the manufacturing facility (2 patients; 1 who died 
from pulmonary hemorrhage and 1 who died from multiorgan failure), phy-
sician decision (1), and apheresis-related issue (1). All patients who com-
pleted screening and whose apheresis product was received and accepted 
by the manufacturing facility were enrolled in the study. Of the 75 patients 
who received an infusion, 65 (87%) received bridging chemotherapy be-
tween enrollment and infusion, and 72 (96%) received lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy (fludarabine–cyclophosphamide [71 patients] or cytarabine–
etoposide [1]). Seventeen enrolled patients did not receive a tisagenlecleucel 
infusion because of product-related issues (7 patients), death (7 patients;  
4 from disease progression and 1 each from sepsis, respiratory failure, and 
fungemia), and adverse events (3 patients; 1 each from graft-versus-host 
disease, systemic mycosis, and fungal pneumonia). Tisagenlecleucel product-
related issues included an inability to manufacture as a result of poor cell 
growth for 6 patients and a technical issue unrelated to cell growth for 1 pa-
tient. Patients who received the infusion but discontinued follow-up were 
followed for survival. At the time of data cutoff, 27 patients had discontin-
ued follow-up owing to death (11 patients; 7 from disease progression and 
1 each from encephalitis, cerebral hemorrhage, systemic mycosis, and hepa-
tobiliary disorders related to allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplan-
tation), lack of efficacy (9 patients; nonresponse or relapse), new therapy 
while in complete remission (5), and patient or guardian decision (2); 48 
patients remained in follow-up. ALL denotes acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

therapy, which was not given at investigator dis-
cretion if a patient had leukopenia. Patients 
received a median weight-adjusted dose of 3.1×106 
transduced viable T cells per kilogram of body 
weight (range, 0.2×106 to 5.4×106 cells per kilo-
gram); the median total dose of transduced via-
ble T cells was 1.0×108 (range, 0.03×108 to 2.6×108 
cells) (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Efficacy
In the interim analysis, which included 50 pa-
tients, the primary end point was met, with an 
overall remission rate of 82% (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 69 to 91; P<0.001); the results with 
regard to all key secondary end points were also 
significant.4 In this updated analysis involving 
75 patients who received a tisagenlecleucel infu-
sion and had at least 3 months of follow-up, the 
overall remission rate was 81% (95% CI, 71 to 
89); 45 patients (60%) had complete remission, 
and 16 (21%) had complete remission with in-
complete hematologic recovery. All patients who 
had a best overall response of complete remis-
sion with or without complete hematologic re-
covery were negative for minimal residual dis-
ease; 95% (58 of 61) of these patients were 
negative by day 28. In an intention-to-treat analy-
sis of the full enrolled population (92 patients), 
which included patients who discontinued partici-
pation in the study before tisagenlecleucel infu-
sion, the overall remission rate was 66% (95% CI, 
56 to 76) (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). In subgroup analyses that included patients 
with or without previous transplantation, with 
high-risk genomic lesions, or with Down’s syn-
drome, the overall remission rate ranged from 
79% to 83% (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Among the 61 patients with complete remis-
sion with or without complete hematologic re-
covery, the median response duration was not 
reached (Fig. 2A). The rate of relapse-free sur-
vival among patients with a response to treatment 
was 80% (95% CI, 65 to 89) at 6 months and 
59% (95% CI, 41 to 73) at 12 months. Among 
patients with complete remission, 17 had a re-
lapse before receiving additional anticancer ther-
apy. Relapse also occurred in 3 patients who 
proceeded to receive new cancer therapy for the 
emergence of minimal residual disease or loss of 
tisagenlecleucel persistence and in 2 patients who 
had already been classified as not having a re-
sponse to treatment because remission was not 
maintained for at least 28 days. No patients were 
found to have relapses in the central nervous 
system (CNS) during primary follow-up; 1 CNS 
relapse was reported after new anticancer ther-
apy. Characterization of CD19 status at the time 
of relapse showed that 1 patient had a CD19+ 
recurrence and 15 patients had CD19− (3 with 
concomitant CD19+ blasts); 6 patients had un-
known CD19 status.
The rate of event-free survival was 73% (95% 
CI, 60 to 82) at 6 months and 50% (95% CI, 35 to 
64) at 12 months (Fig. 2B); median event-free sur-
vival was not reached. Eight patients underwent 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation 
while in remission, including 2 patients with 
minimal residual disease–positive bone marrow 
and 2 with B-cell recovery within 6 months after 
infusion. All 8 patients were alive at the time of 
manuscript submission — 4 with no relapse and 
4 with unknown disease status. The rate of over-
all survival among the 75 patients who received 
tisagenlecleucel was 90% (95% CI, 81 to 95) at 
6 months after infusion and 76% (95% CI, 63 
to 86) at 12 months after infusion (Fig. 2B, and 
Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Tisagenlecleucel Expansion and Persistence
Tisagenlecleucel transgene was detected in periph-
eral blood by means of qualitative polymerase 
chain reaction.5 Among the 60 patients with a 
response at day 28 who could be evaluated for 
cellular kinetics, the median time to maximum 
expansion (Tmax) was 10 days (range, 5.7 to 28), 
whereas 6 patients with no response had a Tmax of 
20 days (range, 13 to 63) (Table S4 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Nine patients who could not 
be evaluated for response were not included in 
the analysis. Expansion, measured as the geomet-
ric mean of the area under the concentration–time 
curve in peripheral blood from time 0 to day 28 
(expressed as copies per microgram of DNA 
times days), was 315,000 in patients with a re-
sponse and 301,000 in patients without a response 
(Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
median duration of persistence of tisagenlecleucel 
in blood was 168 days (range, 20 to 617 days; 60 
patients) at data cutoff. Across the wide range of 
doses infused, no relationship between dose and 
expansion was observed (r2<0.001) (Fig. S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix), and clinical responses 
were observed across the entire dose range.

Tisagenlecleucel in B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia
B-Cell Aplasia
All patients with a response to treatment had 
B-cell aplasia, and most patients in the study 
received immunoglobulin replacement in accor-
dance with local practice. The median time to 
B-cell recovery was not reached (Fig. S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The probability of 
maintenance of B-cell aplasia at 6 months after 
infusion was 83% (95% CI, 69 to 91).
Cytokine Response
Among the 75 patients who received tisagenlec-
leucel, transient increases in serum interleu-
kin-6, interferon gamma, and ferritin levels oc-
curred during the cytokine release syndrome 
after infusion; these increases tended to be more 
pronounced in patients with grade 4 cytokine 
release syndrome than in patients with lower 
grades (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Similar trends were observed in the levels of 
other cytokines, including interleukin-10, inter-
leukin-12p70, interleukin-1β, interleukin-2, inter-
leukin-4, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis fac-
tor α. A transient increase in the C-reactive 
protein level was observed in most patients, but 
with large variability.
Safety
The safety analysis set included all 75 patients 
who received an infusion of tisagenlecleucel; the 
median time from infusion to data cutoff was 
13.1 months (range, 2.1 to 23.5). Eighteen pa-
tients (24%) received their infusions in an outpa-
tient setting. All patients had at least one adverse 
event during the study; 71 of 75 patients (95%)

Figure 2. Duration of Remission, Event-free Survival, 
and Overall Survival.
Panel A shows the duration of remission, defined as 
the time to relapse after the onset of remission, in the 
61 patients who had a best overall response of either 
complete remission or complete remission with incom-
plete hematologic recovery. Panel B shows event-free 
survival among the 75 patients who received an infusion, 
defined as the time from tisagenlecleucel infusion to 
the earliest of the following events: no response (8 pa-
tients), relapse before response was maintained for at 
least 28 days (2), or relapse after having complete re-
mission or complete remission with incomplete hema-
tologic recovery (17). A total of 32 patients had still not 
had an event at the time of data cutoff. Data for 16 more 
patients were censored for event-free survival — 8 pa-
tients for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation during 
remission, 7 patients for new cancer therapy other than 
stem-cell transplantation during remission (4 received 
humanized anti-CD19 CAR T cells, 1 received ponatinib, 
1 received vincristine sulfate and blinatumomab, and  
1 received antithymocyte globulin), and 1 patient for 
lack of adequate assessment. Ten patients were followed 
for relapse after new therapy, 4 of whom had a relapse 
or died. Panel B also shows overall survival among the 
75 patients who received an infusion from the date of 
tisagenlecleucel infusion to the date of death from any 
cause. Nineteen patients died after tisagenlecleucel in-
fusion, and 56 patients had their data censored at the 
time of the last follow-up. Tick marks indicate the time 
of censoring.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
had an adverse event that was suspected by the 
investigators to be related to tisagenlecleucel 
(Table 1). The most common nonhematologic 
adverse events of any grade at any time after 
infusion were the cytokine release syndrome 
(77%), pyrexia (40%), decreased appetite (39%), 
febrile neutropenia (36%), and headache (36%) 
(Tables S6 and S7 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Within 8 weeks after infusion, febrile neu-
tropenia occurred in 35% of the patients, and 
grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with a body tempera-
ture higher than 38.3°C occurred in 46 of 75 pa-
tients (61%). Fever, neutropenia, and the cytokine 
release syndrome often occurred concurrently 
after lymphodepleting chemotherapy and tisa-
genlecleucel infusion; differences in reporting 
may reflect differential attribution of fever to the 
cytokine release syndrome rather than to neu-
tropenia.
A total of 66 of 75 patients (88%) had a grade 
3 or 4 adverse event; 55 of 75 patients (73%) had 
a grade 3 or 4 tisagenlecleucel-related adverse 
event (Table 1). Within 8 weeks after infusion, 
52 of 75 patients (69%) had a grade 3 or 4 tisa-
genlecleucel-related adverse event; during the 
period from 8 weeks to 1 year after infusion, 
the incidence decreased to 12 of the 70 patients 
for whom follow-up data were available (17%) 
(Table 2). Adverse events of special interest in-
cluded the cytokine release syndrome, cytopenias 
not resolved by day 28, infections, neurologic 
events, and the tumor lysis syndrome; 67 of 75 
patients (89%) had an adverse event of special 
interest within 8 weeks after infusion (Table 3). 
The cytokine release syndrome occurred in 58 of 
75 patients (77%); the median time to onset was 
3 days (range, 1 to 22), and the median duration 
was 8 days (range, 1 to 36). A total of 35 of 75 
patients (47%) were admitted to the intensive 
care unit (ICU) for management of the cytokine 
release syndrome, with a median stay of 7 days 
(range, 1 to 34). Nineteen patients (25%) were 
treated with high-dose vasopressors, 33 (44%) 
received oxygen supplementation, 10 (13%) re-
ceived mechanical ventilation, 7 (9%) underwent 
dialysis, and 28 (37%) received tocilizumab for 
management of the cytokine release syndrome.6
Neurologic events occurred in 30 of 75 pa-
tients (40%) within 8 weeks after infusion. Ten 
patients (13%) had grade 3 neurologic events; no 
grade 4 events or cerebral edema were reported. 
The most common neurologic events of any 
grade were encephalopathy (11%), confusional 
state (9%), delirium (9%), tremor (8%), agitation 
(7%), and somnolence (7%); 1 patient had a sei-
zure (grade 3). The majority of neurologic events 
occurred during the cytokine release syndrome 
or shortly after its resolution. Severe neurologic 
events occurred more frequently in patients with 
higher-grade cytokine release syndrome (Table 
S7 in the Supplementary Appendix); grade 3 neu-
rologic events occurred more frequently in pa-
tients with grade 4 cytokine release syndrome 
than among those with grade 0 through 3 (32% 
[6 of 19] vs. 7% [4 of 56]; 95% CI for the differ-
ence, −1 to 50 percentage points). Among grade 
3 neurologic episodes that resolved, 50% re-
solved within 10 days, and 75% resolved within 
18 days. Four grade 3 neurologic episodes were 
unresolved in 3 patients at the time of discon-
tinuation for no response (1 patient) or at the 
time of death (1 death due to leukemia progres-
sion and 1 due to encephalitis), 2 of which were 
thought to be related to tisagenlecleucel (1 each 
of encephalopathy and delirium). Neurologic 
events were managed with supportive care af-
ter ruling out other potential causes of the 
symptoms.

Tisagenlecleucel in B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia
A total of 31 of 75 patients (41%) had grade 3 
or 4 decreased platelet counts that had not re-
solved by day 28. Of those 31 patients, 22 had 
resolution to grade 2 or lower by the last assess-
ment, and 9 did not. By month 3, the Kaplan–
Meier estimate of the percentage of patients with 
resolution to grade 2 or lower was 73%. A grade 
3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count that had not 
resolved by day 28 was reported in 40 of 75 pa-
tients (53%). Of those 40 patients, 32 had resolu-
tion to grade 2 or lower by the last assessment, 
and 8 did not; the Kaplan–Meier estimate of the 
percentage of patients who had resolution to 
grade 2 or lower by month 3 was 66%. Eighteen 
of these 40 patients (45%) had grade 3 or 4 infec-
tions. In rare cases, prolonged grade 3 or 4 neu-
tropenia before and after tisagenlecleucel infu-
sion was associated with infections that were 
severe (grade 3 human herpesvirus 6 [HHV-6] 
encephalitis) or fatal (encephalitis and systemic 
mycosis).

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
Nineteen deaths occurred after tisagenlecleu-
cel infusion. Within 30 days after infusion, 1 pa-
tient died from cerebral hemorrhage in the con-
text of coagulopathy and resolving cytokine 
release syndrome (15 days after infusion), and 
1 patient died from progressive B-cell ALL. More 
than 30 days after infusion, 17 patients died; the 
causes of death were B-cell ALL relapse or pro-
gression (12 patients), HHV-6–positive encepha-
litis in association with prolonged neutropenia 
and lymphopenia (1), systemic mycosis in asso-
ciation with prolonged neutropenia (1), and un-
known causes (1); in 2 patients, death occurred 
after new therapies for B-cell ALL (1 from pneu-
monia and 1 from hepatobiliary disease).
Discussion
In this global, multicenter, pivotal study of CAR 
T-cell therapy, high response rates were shown 
in children and young adults with relapsed or 
refractory B-cell ALL, 61% of whom had had a 
relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell 
transplantation. Effective distribution of tisagen-
lecleucel across four continents with the use of 
a global supply chain was shown to be feasible 
and resulted in efficacy and safety similar to 
those observed in the previous, single-center 
study.1
This updated analysis showed an overall re-
mission rate of 81% among 75 patients with at 
least 3 months of follow-up after a single infu-
sion of tisagenlecleucel. The remissions were du-
rable, with a 6-month relapse-free survival rate 
of 80%. The durability of the clinical response 
was associated with persistence of tisagenlecleu-
cel in peripheral blood and with persistent B-cell 
aplasia.
The treatment of patients who have relapsed 
or refractory B-cell ALL after failure of two 
regimens is challenging. The rate of minimal 
residual disease–negative overall remission of 
81% and the 6-month overall survival rate of 
90% found in this study of tisagenlecleucel com-
pare favorably with the rates achieved with Food 
and Drug Administration–approved agents for 
relapsed B-cell ALL. A pivotal phase 2 study of 
clofarabine involving 61 pediatric patients with 
relapsed or refractory ALL showed a response 
rate of 20%, a median response duration of 29 
weeks (range, 1 to 48), and a median overall 
survival of 13 weeks (range, 1 to 89).7 In a study 
of the CD19–CD3 bispecific antibody blinatumo-
mab, complete remission occurred in 27 of the 
70 pediatric patients (39%) with relapsed or re-
fractory B-cell ALL within the first two cycles of 
blinatumomab treatment, with a rate of negativ-
ity for minimal residual disease of 20% and a 
median overall survival of 7.5 months.8
High rates of complete remission have also 
been found in pediatric and adult patients with 
relapsed or refractory ALL treated with other 
anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapies, and U.S. multi-
center phase 1–2 studies of the CAR T-cell ther-
apy KTE-C19 have been initiated in pediatric and 
adult patients with relapsed or refractory ALL.9-14 
One key difference between CAR designs is the 
costimulatory domain; tisagenlecleucel contains 
a 4-1BB domain, which has been suggested to 
improve the persistence of CAR T cells through 
amelioration of T-cell exhaustion.15 In a phase 1 
study of KTE-C19, which contains a CD28 do-
main, involving 21 children and young adults, 
CAR T cells were not detected beyond 68 days; 
therefore, KTE-C19 has been used as a bridge to 
allogeneic transplantation for most patients who 
receive it.13 In an updated analysis involving 38 
patients, all but 1 patient in sustained remission 
proceeded to undergo allogeneic transplanta-
tion, and median leukemia-free survival was 17.7 
months.16 The anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy 
JCAR017, which contains a 4-1BB costimulatory 
domain, was recently shown to result in a median 
expected duration of B-cell aplasia of 3 months 
in a cohort of 42 pediatric and young adult pa-
tients with ALL and was detected at 6 months in 
patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma who had a response to treatment.17,18 
In an analysis involving 29 adult patients with 
ALL who were treated with JCAR017, of whom 
27 had complete remission, 8 of the 13 in ongo-
ing remission underwent subsequent allogeneic 
transplantation.19 In the present study, the me-
dian persistence of tisagenlecleucel was 168 days 
at data cutoff, with ongoing persistence for as 
long as 20 months and relapse-free survival rates 
of 80% at 6 months and 59% at 12 months, with 
only 9% of patients proceeding to undergo allo-
geneic transplantation.
Previous studies showing promising results 
with anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapies in the treat-
ment of relapsed and refractory B-cell ALL were 
single-center studies, with manufacture occur-
ring on site; therefore, the reproducibility and

Tisagenlecleucel in B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia
feasibility of central manufacture in a global, 
multicenter setting remained uncertain. The tox-
icity and efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in this glob-
al, multicenter study were consistent with those 
in the single-center study, and the feasibility of 
a global supply chain was demonstrated.1,4 Be-
cause this study used cryopreserved leukaphere-
sis product (see the Methods section in the Sup-
plementary Appendix), it did not require fresh 
product and an open manufacture slot for en-
rollment. Training in the management of toxic 
effects and data collection included implementa-
tion of a grading scale for the cytokine release 
syndrome that was developed at the University of 
Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Phila-
delphia, as well as a defined cytokine release 
syndrome management algorithm (Table S9 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).20 Tisagenlecleucel 
was administered as a single infusion, and most 
toxic effects were observed only during the first 
8 weeks after infusion. The product could be 
administered in the outpatient setting. In some 
cases, centers would initially elect to administer 
infusions to inpatients and then change to out-
patient administration after they had gained more 
experience. Patients who were treated in the out-
patient setting were admitted for fever. The me-
dian time from the onset of the cytokine release 
syndrome to grade 3 or 4 levels was 3 days. Al-
though nearly half the patients received care in 
an ICU, the criteria for admission to the ICU 
varied widely across institutions. A total of 25% 
of patients were treated with high-dose vaso-
pressors, a treatment commonly administered in 
intensive care settings.
Neurologic adverse events, which have been 
observed with anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapies 
and blinatumomab,8-10,21 occurred in our study. 
Most neurologic adverse events were transient, 
did not include cerebral edema, and appeared to 
be more frequent in patients with higher-grade 
cytokine release syndrome.
Ongoing tisagenlecleucel persistence was ob-
served more than 1 year after infusion in pa-
tients with a treatment response. Across a 2-log 
tisagenlecleucel dose range, multi-log expansion 
occurred, and no relationship between infusion 
dose and expansion was found. This finding in-
dicates that patients can be effectively treated 
with tisagenlecleucel across a wide dose range 
without an apparent effect on expansion and re-
sponse.
In conclusion, tisagenlecleucel produced high 
remission rates and durable remissions without 
additional therapy in high-risk pediatric and 
young adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
B-cell ALL. The risks associated with tisagenle-
cleucel are substantial, leading to ICU-level care 
in some cases, but were mitigated in most pa-
tients with supportive measures and cytokine 
blockade.
