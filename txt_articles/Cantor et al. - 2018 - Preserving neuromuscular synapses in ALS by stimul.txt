Abstract In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and animal models of ALS, including SOD1-G93A
mice, disassembly of the neuromuscular synapse precedes motor neuron loss and is sufficient to
cause a decline in motor function that culminates in lethal respiratory paralysis. We treated SOD1-
G93A mice with an agonist antibody to MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase essential for maintaining
neuromuscular synapses, to determine whether increasing muscle retrograde signaling would slow
nerve terminal detachment from muscle. The agonist antibody, delivered after disease onset,
slowed muscle denervation, promoting motor neuron survival, improving motor system output, and
extending the lifespan of SOD1-G93A mice. These findings suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for
ALS, using an antibody format with clinical precedence, which targets a pathway essential for
maintaining attachment of nerve terminals to muscle.

Introduction
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that progresses relentlessly from
a subtle decline in motor function to lethal respiratory paralysis within a few years of diagnosis
(Pasinelli and Brown, 2006; Taylor et al., 2016). The disease can be familial and caused by domi-
nant mutations in one of several genes, including SOD1, C9orf72, TDP43, and FUS (Taylor et al.,
2016). More commonly, however, the disease is idiopathic.
Although motor neuron cell death is a hallmark feature of ALS, the loss of neuromuscular synap-
ses occurs prior to the loss of motor neurons and is the primary cause of motor paralysis in both
familial and sporadic forms of ALS (Fischer et al., 2004; Schaefer et al., 2005; Pun et al., 2006).
The detachment of motor nerve terminals and withdrawal of motor axons has received less attention
than the later loss of motor neurons, but therapeutic approaches designed to preserve neuromuscu-
lar synapses have the potential to maintain motor function, especially during the early phases of dis-
ease, and provide benefit to the quality of life for patient and family.
Transgenic mice bearing dominant mutations in the human SOD1 gene, including SOD1-G93A
mice, recapitulate the hallmark features of ALS and provide the most thoroughly studied animal
model for ALS (Vinsant et al., 2013a; Vinsant et al., 2013b). Moreover, because detachment of
motor nerve terminals is the primary cause for paralysis in SOD1-G93A mice, SOD1-G93A mice rep-
resent a clinically relevant model for ALS.
The signaling pathways that control attachment of motor axon terminals to muscle are only
beginning to be understood, but two genes, Lrp4 and Musk, expressed by muscle, play important

 roles. Lrp4, a member of the LDL receptor family, is the muscle receptor for the critical neuronal
ligand, Agrin (Kim et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008). Upon binding Agrin, Lrp4 associates with
MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase, stimulating MuSK and leading to anchoring and enhanced expres-
sion of critical postsynaptic proteins, including Lrp4 (Burden et al., 2013). Clustered Lrp4 then sig-
nals back to motor axons to stimulate their attachment and differentiation (Yumoto et al., 2012).
Recessive mutations in Agrin, Lrp4 or Musk cause congenital myasthenia, a group of neuromuscu-
lar disorders, distinct from ALS, which compromise the structure and function of neuromuscular syn-
apses and lead to muscle weakness and fatigue (Engel et al., 2015). Moreover, autoantibodies to
Agrin, Lrp4, or MuSK cause myasthenia gravis (MG), which is likewise distinct from ALS (Gilhus and
Verschuuren, 2015). In MuSK MG, the pathogenic antibodies are usually directed to the first Ig-like
domain in MuSK and reduce MuSK phosphorylation by impairing binding between Lrp4 and MuSK
(Huijbers et al., 2013; Koneczny et al., 2013).
Although defects in the MuSK signaling pathway are not associated with ALS, increasing MuSK
gene expression stabilizes neuromuscular synapses in SOD1-G93A mice, reducing the extent of mus-
cle denervation and improving motor function (Pe
´rez-Garcı
´a and Burden, 2012). However, these
experiments used transgenic mice to modestly increase MuSK expression from muscle, beginning
during early development, several months prior to disease onset. Therefore, the therapeutic poten-
tial of increasing MuSK signaling as a strategy to reduce denervation and improve motor function in
patients diagnosed with ALS remained unclear. Here, we sought to determine whether a pharmaco-
logical approach to increase MuSK activity in vivo would preserve neuromuscular synapses in SOD1-
G93A mice when dosing was initiated after disease onset. This type of approach would have sub-
stantially improved potential for translation to ALS patients without the complex requirements for
gene therapy (Miyoshi et al., 2017).
eLife digest Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis – often shortened to ALS – is a disease that starts
with difficulties moving and progresses to paralysis of many muscles, including those used for
breathing. The disease is usually lethal, with patients rarely surviving more than a few years after
diagnosis. There is no cure or effective treatment for the disease. It begins with the breakdown of
the connections, or synapses, between the muscles and the nerve cells that connect with them. After
this, the nerve cell itself breaks down. Many therapeutic approaches have focused on attempts to
prevent the nerve cells from dying, but few target the initial degeneration of the synapse.
Cantor et al. asked if intervening when the synapse has already begun to break down could slow
the progression of the disease in mice with ALS. Their approach involved using an antibody to bind
to a receptor protein called MuSK, which plays an important role in maintaining the synapse
between muscle and nerve cell. The antibody boosted the receptor’s activity, helping to preserve
synapses, including those that connect nerve cells to the diaphragm muscle.
The experiments showed that the antibody treatment led to fewer synapses breaking down, and
kept more of the nerve cells alive. Healthier connections between the nervous system and the
diaphragm improved the function of this muscle. As a result, the mice given the antibody treatment
had a slightly extended lifespan, compared with those given no treatment.
The findings suggest a possible new way to develop treatments for ALS, which could be used in
combination with other therapies, such as those aimed at improving the health of the nerve cells.
Together, this could improve quality of life for the majority of patients with ALS. Similar strategies
could be used to develop treatments to preserve synapses in other neurodegenerative diseases,
such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease, as well as some kinds of dementia.
Preserving synapses early on, before the significant loss of nerve cells, could help to slow the
progression of these diseases, improve the patients’ quality of life and extend their lifespans too.

Agonist antibodies to MuSK
A previous study identified twenty-one single chain antibodies (scFvs) that recognize mouse MuSK
and raised the idea that a subset of these antibodies may function as MuSK agonists in vivo
(Xie et al., 1997). We studied the activity of two antibodies, #13 and #22, reported to stimulate
MuSK in cultured myotubes, as well as antibody #21, reported to bind but not stimulate MuSK. We
confirmed that antibodies #13 and #22, re-engineered as human IgG1 molecules, stimulated MuSK
tyrosine phosphorylation in the C2 mouse muscle cell line (Figure 1A), whereas antibody #21, as
well as a control IgG1 antibody to ragweed pollen, failed to stimulate MuSK phosphorylation
(Figure 1A).
Agrin stimulates MuSK phosphorylation by binding Lrp4, which promotes association between
Lrp4 and MuSK, requiring the first of three Ig-like domains in MuSK (Zhang et al., 2011). In contrast
to the Agrin-dependent mechanism for activating MuSK, the agonist antibody binds the Fz-like
domain in MuSK, force-dimerizing and stimulating MuSK phosphorylation, independent of Lrp4
(Figure 1B,C and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Importantly, the Fz-like domain is dispensable
for synapse formation in mice (Reme
´dio et al., 2016).
MuSK agonist antibodies engage MuSK in vivo
To determine whether agonist antibody #13 could engage MuSK in vivo, we intraperitoneally (IP)
injected varying amounts of the MuSK agonist antibody on a human IgG1 backbone, or a control
human IgG1 antibody to ragweed pollen, into wild type mice. Several days later, we stained whole
mounts of the diaphragm muscle to determine whether the agonist antibody engaged MuSK at the
synapse. Figure 2A shows that neuromuscular synapses were labeled specifically by the MuSK ago-
nist antibody. MuSK staining was evident as early as 3 days (Figure 2Aiv-vi), and staining persisted
for at least 7 days after the single injection (Figure 2A,vii-ix). The organization of AChRs and nerve
terminals appeared normal (Figure 2A,ii,v,viii), indicating that the MuSK agonist antibody did not
disturb major features of synaptic differentiation. Moreover, visual observation of the antibody-
injected mice did not reveal overt behavioral abnormalities, indicating that the MuSK agonist anti-
body was well tolerated by the mice. Two mg/kg of the agonist antibody was sufficient to saturate
MuSK labeling at the synapse (Figure 2B) and increase MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo (Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 1).
We measured the pharmacokinetic properties of the injected antibody and found that the half-life
of the injected antibody in blood was ~12 days (Figure 2C). The antibody exhibited linear clearance
for 21 days after antibody injection, indicating that exposure could be maintained over several
weeks. In addition, these results demonstrated that the mouse immune system did not recognize
and clear the antibody, which contained a human Fc region, from the circulation over this three-
week time period (Figure 2C).
Single dose of MuSK agonist antibody decreases denervation in SOD1-
G93A mice
We studied female and male SOD1-G93A mice, on a C57BL/6 background, with 21–26 copies of the
human SOD1-G93A gene (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). In SOD1-G93A mice, denervation of
limb muscles begins at P50, whereas denervation of the diaphragm muscle begins a month later
(Pun et al., 2006; Rocha et al., 2013). Because denervation of the diaphragm muscle is responsible
for lethal respiratory paralysis, we focused our analysis on innervation of this muscle. We first quanti-
fied the extent of innervation in the diaphragm muscle at P90 by staining for nerve terminals and
postsynaptic AChRs, which remain even at denervated synaptic sites (Figure 3A). Denervation was
evident in SOD1-G93A mice as early as P90 (Figure 3B,C). From P90 to P110, the extent of full
innervation, defined as perfect apposition of nerve terminals and the AChR-rich postsynaptic mem-
brane, decreased from 77.3% to 18.1% in female and from 53.1% to 16.1% in male SOD1-G93A
mice (Figure 3B). Likewise, the extent of complete denervation increased from 2.3% to 41% in
female and from 16.7% to 24.4% in male SOD1-G93A mice over this twenty-day period (Figure 3C).
SOD1-G93A mice were injected with the MuSK agonist antibody at P90. Because the antibody
had a half-life of 12 days and 2 mg/kg of antibody saturated MuSK at the synapse (Figure 2B,C), we

 injected SOD1-G93A mice with 10 mg/kg of agonist antibody, ensuring that the antibody concentra-
tion in blood would remain at saturating levels for MuSK-binding over the 20 day period. We found
that a single dose of the MuSK agonist antibody increased the number of fully innervated synapses
by 2.7- and 2.5-fold in female and male SOD1-G93A mice, respectively, and decreased the number
of fully denervated synapses by 3.7- and 2.3-fold in female and male SOD1-G93A mice, respectively
(Figure 3B,C). These findings demonstrated that the MuSK agonist antibody, introduced after dis-
ease onset, decreased motor axon withdrawal from the diaphragm muscle.
Chronic dosing with the MuSK agonist antibody halts further
denervation in SOD1-G93A mice for over two months
To determine whether the MuSK agonist antibody could preserve neuromuscular synapses over a
longer time period, we chronically dosed SOD1-G93A mice. To avoid host recognition and clearance
of the antibody during chronic exposure, we used a MuSK #13 antibody on a murine IgG2a back-
bone that also lacked effector functions (Lo et al., 2017). The ability of this ‘reverse chimera’ to bind
and stimulate MuSK was similar to the antibody with a human IgG backbone (Figure 4—figure sup-
plement 1). Moreover, the ‘reverse chimera’ had a half-life similar to the human agonist antibody in
vivo (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).
SOD1-G93A mice were injected with 10 mg/kg of the reverse chimera agonist antibody at P90
and every 24 days thereafter, and we sacrificed chronically injected mice every 24 days to quantify
innervation of the diaphragm muscle (Figure 4A). Because 2 mg/kg of antibody saturated MuSK at
the synapse and because the antibody had a 11 day half-life in blood, this dosing schedule ensured
that saturating levels of the MuSK agonist antibody were maintained at all times (Figure 4—figure
supplement 2).
In SOD1-G93A mice injected with a control antibody to GP120, synaptic loss continued to decline
from P114 through P162, so that only 11% of the synapses were fully innervated at P162
(Figure 4B). This progressive loss was halted by injection of the MuSK agonist antibody, as the num-
ber of fully innervated synapses was largely unchanged (40–50%) from P114 to P162 in SOD1-G93A
mice injected with the MuSK agonist antibody (Figure 4B). Similarly, the number of fully denervated
synapses continued to increase from P114 through P162 in SOD1-G93A mice injected with the con-
trol antibody, whereas this progressive increase was prevented by the MuSK agonist antibody
(Figure 4C). These findings indicate that the MuSK agonist antibody prevented further synaptic loss
and preserved synapses for at least 50 days after signs of denervation and disease were evident in
SOD1-G93A mice.
During disease progression, synapses transition through a partially innervated phase, when only a
portion of the AChR-rich postsynaptic membrane is apposed by motor nerve terminals (Figure 4—
figure supplement 3). Although the number of partially innervated synapses was similar in SOD1-
G93A mice injected with the control or MuSK agonist antibody (Figure 4—figure supplement 3),
the extent of nerve terminal coverage was 34% greater at partially innervated synapses in mice
injected with the MuSK agonist antibody (Figure 4—figure supplement 3). Thus, the MuSK agonist
antibody increased both full innervation as well as nerve terminal coverage at partially innervated
synapses in SOD1-G93A mice.

type and Lrp4 mutant myotubes.

 Improved motor system output of the diaphragm muscle
To determine whether maintaining neuromuscular synapses led to improved motor system output,
we used an ex-vivo phrenic nerve/diaphragm muscle preparation to measure the compound muscle
action potentials (CMAPs), following phrenic nerve stimulation. We studied SOD1-G93A mice three
to four weeks prior to end-stage (Figure 5). We stimulated the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm mus-
cle and recorded CMAPs, which elicit muscle contraction (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We
found no significant difference in the amplitude of the first CMAP between SOD1-G93A mice
injected with the MuSK agonist antibody or the control antibody to GP120 (anti-GP120-treated
males: 5.95 ± 1.14 mV; anti-MuSK-treated males: 5.93 ± 0.52 mV; anti-GP120-treated females:
4.95 ± 0.54 mV; anti-MuSK-treated females: 5.81 ± 0.63 mV). We next measured the reliability of syn-
aptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction by repetitively stimulating the phrenic nerve at a
physiological frequency (20 Hz). We found a rapid and severe decline in the amplitude of the CMAP,
indicative of synaptic dysfunction and denervation, in SOD1-G93A mice chronically injected with the
control antibody to GP120. In contrast, the decline in CMAP amplitude was far less severe in SOD1-
G93A mice treated with the MuSK agonist antibody, demonstrating that the MuSK agonist antibody
improved neuromuscular function (Figure 5). Moreover, repetitive stimulation of the phrenic nerve
at a more challenging frequency (50 Hz) led to frequent failures to elicit a CMAP in SOD1-G93A
mice injected with the control antibody to GP120. Such failures were less frequent in SOD1-G93A
mice injected with the MuSK agonist antibody, similar to wild type mice (Figure 5). These CMAP fail-
ures are likely due to presynaptic mechanisms, such as conduction block or impaired neurotransmit-
ter release, rather than the inability of motor end plates to generate an action potential. In either
case, the maintenance of neuromuscular synapses, stimulated by the MuSK agonist antibody, led to
improved reliability of synaptic transmission and output of the critically important diaphragm muscle
in SOD1-G93A mice.
MuSK agonist antibody decreases motor neuron loss in SOD1-G93A
mice
We next assessed whether preserving neuromuscular synapses in SOD1-G93A mice reduced motor
neuron death. During embryonic development motor neuron death is regulated by innervation and
reduced when motor neurons make additional synapses with muscle (Hollyday and Hamburger,
1976; Tanaka and Landmesser, 1986; Landmesser, 1992), whereas survival of adult motor neurons
is less dependent upon muscle innervation (Lowrie and Vrbova
´, 1992). We quantified the number
of motor neurons, stained for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), in the lumbar spinal cord of SOD1-
G93A mice injected chronically either with the control antibody to GP120 or the MuSK agonist anti-
body (Figure 6A). The MuSK agonist antibody increased the number of motor neurons by 31% to
57% at P138 (Figure 6B), during the peak period of motor neuron cell death in SOD1-G93A mice
when approximately half of spinal motor neurons have been lost (Vinsant et al., 2013a). These find-
ings demonstrate that increasing retrograde signaling after disease onset not only preserves neuro-
muscular synapses but also promotes survival of spinal motor neurons in SOD1-G93A mice.
MuSK agonist antibody extends lifespan of SOD1-G93A mice
Denervation of the diaphragm muscle is responsible for lethal respiratory paralysis in SOD1-G93A
mice and ALS. We therefore asked whether maintaining neuromuscular synapses and improving out-
put of the diaphragm muscle extended the lifespan of SOD1-G93A mice. Female SOD1-G93A mice
injected with the control antibody to GP120 had an average lifespan of 169 days (see Materials and
methods), whereas male SOD1-G93A mice injected with the control antibody had an average life-
span of 157.5 days (Figure 6C,D). Chronic injection with the MuSK agonist antibody prolonged sur-
vival of female and male SOD1-G93A mice by 7 (p<0.05) and 10 days (p<0.001), respectively

sembly of neuromuscular synapses, improved motor output of the diaphragm muscle and extended
the lifespan of SOD1-G93A mice.
Discussion
ALS is a devastating disease that progresses in a relentless manner from detachment of motor nerve
terminals to lethal respiratory paralysis within several years of diagnosis. Currently, there is an unmet
need for therapies that significantly alter the course of disease. Here, we describe a therapeutic
approach designed to slow the loss of motor innervation to muscle by targeting a well-defined mole-
cule and mechanism for forming and maintaining neuromuscular synapses. We show that an agonist
antibody to MuSK, introduced after disease onset, decreases muscle denervation, improves motor
system output, reduces motor neuron loss and extends survival in an aggressive mouse model of
ALS. If this strategy, described here for an aggressive mouse model of ALS, were similarly successful
in preserving innervation in sporadic and familial ALS, this therapeutic approach would have the
potential to improve the quality of life for ALS patients, and as such warrants further study.
Anti-sense RNA directed toward SOD1 is currently being tested as a promising therapeutic for
ALS caused by mutations in SOD1 (Miller et al., 2013). A similar approach may ultimately be effec-
tive for other dominant, familial forms of ALS (Reddy and Miller, 2015; van Zundert and Brown,
2017). However, >80% of ALS patients are diagnosed with sporadic ALS, so strategies to inactivate
a single culprit gene are not tenable for most cases of ALS. Instead, multiple, concurrent therapeutic
interventions that effectively address the pathology and symptoms of ALS will likely be necessary to
alter the course of disease (Brown and Al-Chalabi, 2017).
Because synaptic loss and muscle denervation are common to sporadic as well as familial forms of
ALS, the approach described here has the potential to be effective for both forms of ALS. Moreover,
increasing MuSK activity and retrograde signaling may also slow the deterioration of neuromuscular
synapses in other neuromuscular diseases and during aging (Engel et al., 2015; Gilhus and Ver-
schuuren, 2015; Valdez et al., 2012; Poort et al., 2016). Consistent with this idea, adenoviral
expression of Dok-7, an inside-outside activator of MuSK, not only extends longevity of SOD1-G93A
mice but also provides benefit in other mouse models of neuromuscular disease, including congeni-
tal myasthenia and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (Miyoshi et al., 2017; Arimura et al., 2014).
Further, there is increasing evidence that synaptic loss occurs early during disease progression in
other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s
disease and Frontotemporal dementia and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (Henstridge et al., 2016), so
similar strategies, designed to preserve synapses, may slow progression in these diseases as well.
Our proof of concept experiments were designed to determine whether boosting retrograde sig-
naling in vivo with the MuSK agonist antibody might slow motor axon withdrawal and muscle dener-
vation in SOD1-G93A mice. As such, we introduced the MuSK agonist antibody after denervation
was already evident, during the early phase of denervation in female SOD1-G93A mice and mid-
phase in male SOD1-G93A mice, but before SOD1-G93A mice exhibited overt and severe deficits in
limb motor function. This timing for delivery of the MuSK agonist antibody may be pertinent and sig-
nificant for ALS, as denervation is the cause of muscle fibrillations, an early clinical sign in ALS.
Because MuSK-dependent retrograde signaling is likely to act focally on nerve terminals and axons
that are near the postsynaptic membrane and to be less effective in promoting regeneration of

 Figure 5. The MuSK agonist antibody improves motor system output in the diaphragm muscle. (A,B) 20 Hz stimulation (arrow) of the phrenic nerve
from SOD1-G93A mice injected with the control antibody to GP120 led to a rapid and severe decline in the CMAP amplitude. In contrast, the CMAP
amplitude decreased gradually and modestly in SOD1-G93A mice injected with the MuSK agonist antibody. After 5 s, the MuSK agonist improved
CMAP amplitude by 13.6% in females and by 31.7% in males (n = 6–7; p<0.0001). The faint grey and blue lines indicate the SEMs. (C,D) 50 Hz
stimulation (S, arrow) of the phrenic nerve in SOD1-G93A mice injected with the control antibody to GP120 led to frequent failures (F, arrow) to elicit a
CMAP, whereas CMAPs were reliably elicited in SOD1-G93A mice injected with the MuSK agonist antibody, similar to the number of failures seen in
wild type mice. The MuSK agonist antibody reduced the number of failures by 88% in females and 70% in males during 1 min of stimulation. The scatter
plot shows the values for individual mice, as well as the mean values and SEM; *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001. The baseline CMAP amplitude data are
as follows: anti-GP120-treated males, 5.95 ± 1.14 mV; MuSK agonist antibody-treated males, 5.93 ± 0.52 mV; anti-GP120-treated females, 4.95 ± 0.54
mV; MuSK agonist antibody-treated females, 5.81 ± 0.63 mV.

 axons that have fully withdrawn, early delivery of a MuSK agonist is likely to be more effective than
later delivery in ALS.
However, ALS is a diagnosis of exclusion, leading to delays in diagnosis. Nonetheless, even at
late stages of disease, a majority of synapses in SOD1-G93A mice are partially innervated, and the
MuSK agonist antibody improved nerve terminal coverage at these partially innervated synapses.
These findings suggest that the MuSK agonist antibody may also be effective if introduced later dur-
ing disease. However, because overt motor deficits become evident in SOD1-G93A mice only a
month before death, this aggressive mouse model of ALS may not be the optimal and most informa-
tive model to infer whether later introduction of the MuSK agonist antibody can stabilize synapses
and slow motor dysfunction in ALS.
The loss of motor neurons during embryonic development is regulated, at least in part by synapse
formation (Hollyday and Hamburger, 1976; Tanaka and Landmesser, 1986; Landmesser, 1992).

 The increased survival of motor neurons in MuSK agonist antibody-injected SOD1-G93A mice indi-
cates that adult motor neurons can likewise receive trophic support from muscle. Thus, preserving
neuromuscular synapses not only maintains the essential attachment of nerve to muscle but also pro-
vides the added benefit of promoting motor neuron survival.
Although we used an agonist antibody to MuSK to stimulate retrograde signaling from muscle,
one can envisage other approaches to stimulate MuSK or enhance retrograde signaling in order to
maintain attachment of motor axons to muscle. The MuSK agonist antibody is effective at maintain-
ing neuromuscular synapses in SOD1-G93A mice up to P162, but within the next week, synapses are
lost, and the mice die. Because the MuSK agonist antibody is designed to maintain neuromuscular
synapses and does not directly target or address the underlying cause of the disease and other
pathologies in SOD1-G93A mice and ALS, the benefit of increasing retrograde signaling from mus-
cle to nerve and promoting nerve terminal attachment is limited. Nonetheless, although the anti-
body cannot override the many pathological pathways that occur in the motor neuron and in non-
neuronal cells, this therapeutic approach has a potent effect on the course of disease, reducing syn-
aptic loss, improving motor output and extending the lifespan of SOD1-G93A mice longer than rilu-
zole, the long-standing FDA approved treatment for ALS (Jablonski et al., 2014). Motor neuron cell
death is a critical feature in ALS, but elimination of Bax, which prevents apoptotic cell death, fails to
preserve neuromuscular synapses and increases survival of SOD1-G93A mice by only 20 days
(Gould et al., 2006). Together with our studies, these findings give credence to the idea that combi-
natorial therapeutic interventions, including those that preserve neuromuscular synapses, will be nec-
essary to fully address the complex pathology and symptoms of ALS and contribute to an improved
quality of life for patient and family.

Study design
The investigators were blinded from knowing whether mice were treated with the MuSK agonist or
control antibody while acquiring and initially analyzing data. Data are presented as mean ±SEM. Sta-
tistical comparisons between groups were analyzed using an unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test,
log-rank test (survival), linear regression (CMAPs), or two-way ANOVA (failures). Statistical analyses
were conducted using Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad Software). The number (n) of mice used to cal-
culate the mean, SEM values and the confidence limits (p values) are indicated in the figure legends.
Mice
The copy number of the human SOD1-G93A gene was routinely quantified by TaqMan real-time
PCR and normalized to GAPDH (Life Technologies Assay# Mm00186822_cn). All mice included in
this study had 21–26 copies of hSOD1-G93A (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). DietGel 76A
(ClearH20) was placed on the cage floor so that mice had ready access to nourishment. Others have
measured the lifespan SOD1-G93A mice by placing mice on their side and sacrificing mice if they
were unable to right themselves in 15 s. Because we were concerned that this assay reported on
limb muscle function and may not be temporally aligned with the time of death, we used a variant
assay, which provided an accurate measure of longevity. When mice were unable to right themselves
to eat or drink over the course of several hours, they invariably succumbed within a day; we defined
this time as disease end-point and sacrificed mice at this time. Mice were housed and maintained
according to Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee (IACUC) guidelines.
Histology
Diaphragm muscles were stained with Alexa 594-conjugated a-bungarotoxin (a-BGT) (Life Technolo-
gies, Carlsbad, CA) to mark AChRs and rabbit antibodies to Neurofilament-L (SYnaptic Systems,
Goettingen, Germany) and Synapsin 1/2 (SYynaptic Systems, Goettingen, Germany) to label axons
and nerve terminals, as described previously (Jaworski and Burden, 2006; Friese et al., 2007). At
fully innervated synapses, nerve terminal staining completely overlapped with postsynaptic AChRs,
whereas nerve terminals were absent from original synaptic sites, marked by AChRs, at fully dener-
vated synapses. At partially innervated synapses, nerve terminals occupied only a portion of the
postsynaptic membrane. We examined a minimum of 50 synapses in the diaphragm muscle from
each mouse and designated each synapse as fully innervated, partially innervated, or fully dener-
vated. At each partially innervated synapse, the percentage of AChR-stained postsynaptic mem-
brane that was apposed by Synapsin-stained nerve terminals was quantified using Volocity imaging
software (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). To visualize and quantify staining of the agonist antibody,
containing human Fc, at the neuromuscular junction, we used an Alexa 647-conjugated anti-human
secondary (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Whole mounts of muscles were imaged with a Zeiss

 LSM800 confocal microscope, and the fluorescent signal was quantified as described previously
(Jaworski and Burden, 2006; Friese et al., 2007).
Spinal cords were dissected from mice perfused with 4% formaldehyde. Frozen sections (20 mm)
of the lumbar region were stained with antibodies to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) (AB144P-
200UL from Millipore, Billerica, MA). We defined motor neurons as cells in the ventral horn of the
lumbar spinal cord that were positive for ChAT, excluding ChAT-positive preganglionic and Pitx2-
positive neurons. We only counted ChAT-stained cells with a clearly defined nucleus in order to
avoid double-counting motor neurons in multiple sections. We analyzed ~10 sections, evenly spaced
in the lumbar enlargement, which together contained >50 motor neurons in each mouse.
Antibody-binding and MuSK phosphorylation
Chimeric antibodies were produced by transferring cDNAs encoding the variable regions of MuSK
agonist antibody #13 to expression vectors containing the mouse kappa and IgG2a constant region.
MuSK agonist antibodies were produced in CHO cells and purified by Protein A and size exclusion
chromatography. The activity of the reverse chimera antibody for stimulating clustering of AChRs in
C2 myotubes was similar to that for the human agonist antibody to MuSK (Figure 4—figure supple-
ment 1). Fab fragments were prepared by protease digestion of human IgG1 followed by removal
of uncleaved IgG and Fc fragments on a Protein A Sepharose column and size exclusion
chromatography.
We used a solid-phase binding assay to measure binding between the MuSK agonist antibody
and the extracellular (ecto) region (E22 to T494), the first three Ig-like domains (E22 to I103) or the
Frizzled-like domain (D312 to K456) from mouse MuSK (Zhang et al., 2011). Maxisorp plates were
coated with MuSK agonist antibody #13 (5mg/ml), and subsequently incubated with 8-His-tagged
MuSK proteins, followed by a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated antibody to 8-His. Bound
HRP was quantified by measuring HRP activity (Thermo scientific#34028).
C2C12 muscle cells were purchased from the ATCC and were not tested for mycoplasma prior to
use. These C2C12 muscle cells, as well as immortalized wild type or Lrp4 mutant muscle cells, were
differentiated and treated with either neural Agrin (1 nM) or antibodies (10 nM). MuSK was immuno-
precipitated from lysates, and MuSK expression and MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation were measured
by probing Western blots, as described previously (Herbst and Burden, 2000). C2C12 cells were
grown in 24-well culture plates in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) until myoblasts were
70% confluent. Myoblasts were then allowed to differentiate into myotubes by replacing the FBS
with 2% horse serum. After 7 days, the cultures were treated for 16 hr with varying concentrations of
rcMuSK antibody #13 or a Fab from antibody MuSK #13. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
and stained with Alexa 488 conjugated- a-BGT. Two to four images were collected from each well,
and the number of AChR clusters was analyzed using imageJ software. Neural Agrin (10 nM) (R and
D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used as a positive control for AChR clustering (data not shown).
Hind-limb muscles were denervated by cutting the sciatic nerve, as described previously
(Simon et al., 1992). Four days after denervation, mice were injected with MuSK agonist antibody
#13, and we measured MuSK expression and MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation 3 days later. MuSK and
Dok-7 were immunoprecipitated from lysates, and their expression levels were determined by West-
ern blotting (Herbst and Burden, 2000; Hallock et al., 2010). MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation was
measured by probing Western blots with antibody 4G10, as described previously (Herbst and Bur-
den, 2000; Hallock et al., 2010).
Recording and evaluation of compound muscle action potentials
(CMAPs) from the diaphragm muscle
To assess the function of neuromuscular junction in the mouse diaphragm muscle (Figure 5—figure
supplement 1), we developed an ex vivo phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation. We studied the dia-
phragm muscle from ~P140 male and ~P150 female mice, which is three to four weeks prior to end-
stage, respectively. We did not use the in vivo preparation, described by others (Lepore et al.,
2011), because we were concerned that in vivo stimulation of the phrenic nerve, at moderate to
high frequencies, would lead to variable and unreliable CMAP recordings, likely due to changes in
the electrode position caused by muscle contraction. Moreover, a related method, reported to
record from the mouse diaphragm muscle, uses a surface recording electrode, and likely monitors

 the activity of multiple thoracic muscles (Martin et al., 2015). Thus, following anesthesia with 5% iso-
flurane, mice were decapitated, and the diaphragm muscle, together with the phrenic nerve, was
quickly isolated and transferred to a customized recording chamber. The chamber was perfused con-
tinuously with oxygenated (95% O2 and 5% CO2) artificial cerebrospinal fluid solution (128.25 mM
NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 0.58 mM NaH2PO4, 21 mM NaHCO3, 30 mM D-glucose, 1.5 mM CaCl2, and 1 mM
MgSO4) at a rate of ~10 ml/min at room temperature (~20–24˚C). The phrenic nerve that innervates
the left hemi-diaphragm muscle was stimulated by drawing the distal part of the left phrenic nerve
into a suction electrode (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We validated proper positioning of the
stimulating electrode by visually inspecting muscle contractions following stimulation of the phrenic
nerve. EMG activity was recorded using a suction electrode placed in the upper left quadrant of the
muscle, 1 mm toward the costal side of the main intramuscular nerve and endplate zone in the mid-
dle of the muscle. A light suction was applied to the recording electrode to secure a tight seal
between the tip of the electrode and the muscle fibers. In this manner, damage to the diaphragm
muscle was avoided, which was confirmed by observing muscle contractions during stimulation. The
phrenic nerve was stimulated with square pulses (0.2 ms in duration) at several frequencies (1 Hz to
50 Hz) for 60 s. The intensity of stimulation was progressively increased from the threshold, defined
as the minimum response in three out of five trials, until the CMAP reached a maximal response.
The stimulation intensity was set at twice the intensity required for the maximal response to
ensure a supra-maximal intensity of stimulation (25mA to 200mA). Recordings were accepted for anal-
ysis only when the CMAP amplitude (peak-to-peak) was unchanged following 1 Hz stimulation. The
amplitudes of the evoked CMAPs at higher frequencies were expressed as a percentage of the first
evoked CMAP for the entire duration of stimulation. Recordings were fed to an A/D interface (Digi-
data 1440A, Molecular Devices) and acquired with Clampex (v10.2, Molecular Devices) at a sampling
rate of 50 kHz. Data were analyzed off-line using Clampfit (v10.2, Molecular Devices). We defined
CMAP failures as the absence of an evoked response discernable from the background noise
recorded prior to the stimulation.
