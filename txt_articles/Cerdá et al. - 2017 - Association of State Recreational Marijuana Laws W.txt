IMPORTANCE Historical shifts are occurring in marijuana policy. The effect of legalizing
marijuana for recreational use on rates of adolescent marijuana use is a topic of considerable
debate.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between the legalization of recreational marijuana use
in Washington and Colorado in 2012 and the subsequent perceived harmfulness and use of
marijuana by adolescents.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used data of 253 902 students in eighth, 10th, and
12th grades from 2010 to 2015 from Monitoring the Future, a national, annual, cross-sectional
survey of students in secondary schools in the contiguous United States. Difference-in-
difference estimates compared changes in perceived harmfulness of marijuana use and in
past-month marijuana use in Washington and Colorado prior to recreational marijuana
legalization (2010-2012) with postlegalization (2013-2015) vs the contemporaneous trends
in other states that did not legalize recreational marijuana use in this period.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Perceived harmfulness of marijuana use (great or moderate
risk to health from smoking marijuana occasionally) and marijuana use (past 30 days).
RESULTS Of the 253 902 participants, 120 590 of 245 065(49.2%) were male, and the mean
(SD) age was 15.6 (1.7) years. In Washington, perceived harmfulness declined 14.2% and 16.1%
among eighth and 10th graders, respectively, while marijuana use increased 2.0% and 4.1%
from 2010-2012 to 2013-2015. In contrast, among states that did not legalize recreational
marijuana use, perceived harmfulness decreased by 4.9% and 7.2% among eighth and 10th
graders, respectively, and marijuana use decreased by 1.3% and 0.9% over the same period.
Difference-in-difference estimates comparing Washington vs states that did not legalize
recreational drug use indicated that these differences were significant for perceived
harmfulness (eighth graders: % [SD], −9.3 [3.5]; P = .01; 10th graders: % [SD], −9.0 [3.8];
P = .02) and marijuana use (eighth graders: % [SD], 5.0 [1.9]; P = .03; 10th graders: % [SD],
3.2 [1.5]; P = .007). No significant differences were found in perceived harmfulness or
marijuana use among 12th graders in Washington or for any of the 3 grades in Colorado.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among eighth and 10th graders in Washington, perceived
harmfulness of marijuana use decreased and marijuana use increased following legalization
of recreational marijuana use. In contrast, Colorado did not exhibit any differential change
in perceived harmfulness or past-month adolescent marijuana use following legalization.
A cautious interpretation of the findings suggests investment in evidence-based adolescent
substance use prevention programs in any additional states that may legalize recreational
marijuana use.

H
istorical shifts are occurring in attitudes toward
marijuana and in state marijuana policy in the
United States. The proportion of adolescents who
perceive great risk of harm in using marijuana once or twice
a week has decreased from 55% in 2007 to 44% in 2012,1
and 58% of adults now support legalization of recreational
marijuana.2 Since 1996, 28 states and Washington, DC, have
passed legislation permitting the use of marijuana for medi-
cal purposes.3 In 2012, Colorado and Washington became
the first 2 states to legalize the recreational use of marijuana
for adults. Alaska, Oregon, and Washington, DC, followed
suit in 2014, and California, Maine, Massachusetts, and
Nevada approved the legalization of recreational adult use
in the November 2016 ballots.4 The potential effect of legal-
ization for recreational use on rates of marijuana use in the
United States is a topic of considerable debate.5-9
While legalization for recreational purposes is currently
limited to adults, potential effects on adolescent marijuana
use are of particular concern. Some adolescents who try
marijuana will go on to long-term use, with an accompany-
ing range of adverse outcomes.10-16 However, the effect of
legalizing marijuana for adult recreational use on adoles-
cents is unknown. Studies of the association between medi-
cal marijuana legislation (MML) and adolescent marijuana
use indicate that while states that passed MML have higher
rates of adolescent marijuana use, rates were already higher
in these states before passage of the laws and that rates did
not increase after the laws were passed.17-19 However, stud-
ies of MML cannot be generalized to laws on recreational
use, which may have much broader effects17 through such
factors as pricing,6 advertising, availability, and/or implicit
messages to teens that marijuana use is acceptable or
nonrisky.20,21 Therefore, understanding the effect of legal-
ization for recreational purposes on adolescent marijuana
use is of critical importance.
In this study, we examine the association between legal-
ization of recreational marijuana use for adults (ie, persons
18 years or older) in Washington and Colorado and the
change in perceived harmfulness of marijuana use and in
self-reported adolescent marijuana use before and after
legalization. Both states passed laws legalizing recreational
marijuana use on November 6, 2012. At the time of enact-
ment, possession for personal use was legalized in both
states, and cultivation for personal use was also legalized in
Colorado. Stores that sold marijuana opened in 2014 (in
January in Colorado and July in Washington), and the first
grower licenses in Washington were issued in March 2014.
We tested whether adolescents in Washington and Colo-
rado were less likely to perceive marijuana as harmful and
more likely to use marijuana in the 3 years following legal-
ization (2013-2015) compared with the 3 years prior to legal-
ization (2010-2012) and compared these findings with
trends in states that did not legalize recreational marijuana
use. While full implementation of the law did not occur
until 2014, enactment of the law could in itself have an
effect on marijuana use by increasing advertising of the
product, changing perceptions of the harmfulness of mari-
juana, and legalizing possession.
Methods
Setting, Participants, Procedures
The Monitoring the Future (MTF) study annually conducts na-
tional cross-sectional surveys of eighth, 10th, and 12th
graders.22,23 Data are collected in approximately 400 schools
in the spring in the contiguous United States via self-
administered questionnaires. We analyzed data collected from
2010 to 2015, approximately 3 years before and 3 years after
legalization of recreational marijuana use in Colorado and
Washington. The comparison group included 45 states that
had not legalized recreational marijuana use in this period.
Oregon and Washington, DC, were excluded from our analy-
sis because they legalized recreational marijuana use in 2014;
Alaska was already excluded from the MTF study, as it is not
a contiguous state.
The study uses a multistage random sampling design.
Stages include US geographic area, schools within regions of
thecountry(withprobabilityproportionatetoschoolsize),and
students within schools. Up to 350 students per grade per
school are included, with random selection of classrooms
within schools. Schools participate for 2 consecutive years.
Nonparticipating schools are replaced with others closely
matched on geographic location, size, and urbanicity. Stu-
dent response for the MTF study is 81% to 91% for all years and
grades, with almost all nonresponse due to absenteeism and
less than 1% refusals. Of all selection sample units, 92% to 99%
obtained 1 or more participating schools in all study years; the
lack of a time trend in school participation rates24 suggests that
school nonresponse does not affect results. Across the 6 years
(2010-2015), 253 902 students provided data on marijuana use
(89 316 eighth graders, 85 110 tenth graders, and 79 476 twelfth
graders). In Colorado, 2982 students in 17 schools (28 school
surveys, because some schools were surveyed in more than 1
year) provided data on marijuana use between 2010 and 2015,
and in Washington, 5509 students in 30 schools (47 school sur-
veys) provided data.
Consistency in measures and data collection procedures
was strictly maintained across years and grade levels. Stu-
dents completed questionnaires in classrooms unless larger
Key Points
Question How did the prevalence of adolescent marijuana use
change in Washington and Colorado following legalization of
recreational marijuana use?
Findings In this difference-in-difference analysis of 253 902
adolescents in 47 states, marijuana use among eighth and 10th
graders in Washington increased 2.0% and 4.1%, respectively,
between 2010-2012 and 2013-2015; these trends were
significantly different from trends in states that did not legalize
marijuana. In Colorado, the prevalence of marijuana use
prelegalization and postlegalization did not differ.
Meaning A cautious interpretation of the findings suggests
investment in adolescent substance use prevention programs in
additional states that may legalize recreational marijuana use.

group administrations were required. The MTF study repre-
sentatives distributed and collected questionnaires using stan-
dardizedprocedures,includinginstructionstoteacherstoavoid
proximity to students to maintain confidentiality.
The study was approved by the institutional review
boards at the University of Michigan and Columbia University.
Letters were sent in advance to parents to inform them about
the study and to explain that participation was voluntary and
responses were anonymous (for eighth and 10th graders) or
confidential (for 12th graders). The letters also provided par-
ents with a means to decline their child's participation if
necessary.
Measures
Outcomes
The primary outcome was an individual-level binary variable:
any marijuana use within the prior 30 days.17,25 We also con-
ducted a sensitivity analysis using a measure of marijuana use
frequency (ie, no use, 1-2 occasions, or 3 or more occasions in
the past 30 days). Self-administered forms and data collection
procedures are designed to maximize validity of substance use
reporting.ValidityofMTFsubstancereportsissupportedbylow
question nonresponse, high proportions consistently report-
ing illicit drug use, and strong construct validity.23
Perceived harmfulness of marijuana use was the second
outcome of interest. Respondents were asked, “How much do
you think people risk harming themselves (physically or in
other ways), if they smoke marijuana occasionally?” Re-
sponseoptionsincluded“norisk,
”“slightrisk,
”“moderaterisk,
”
“great risk,” and “can’t say, drug unfamiliar.” We compared
those who perceived “no risk” or “slight risk” with those who
perceived “great risk” or “moderate risk” (“can’t say” was con-
sidered missing).
Main Exposure
The primary exposure was the state-level recreational mari-
juana laws (RML). The variable was used to compare changes
in perceived harmfulness and marijuana use in adolescents liv-
ing in states that passed RML (Colorado and Washington each
separately)withcontemporaneouschangesintheother45con-
tiguous states that had not passed RML. Because RML was en-
acted in Colorado and Washington in November 2012, 2010 to
2012 were considered pre-RML, while 2013 to 2015 were con-
sideredpost-RMLyears.Sensitivityanalysescomparedchanges
in Colorado and Washington with the 20 other contiguous
states (besides Colorado and Washington and excluding Or-
egon) that ever passed MML.
School-Level and State-Level Covariates
School-level control variables included the number of stu-
dentspergradewithintheschool(1-99,100-199,200-299,300-
399, 400-499, 500-699, and 700 or more), public vs private
school, and urban/suburban (ie, schools located within a Met-
ropolitan Statistical Area26) vs rural. State-level control vari-
ables included the proportion of the population in each state
that was male, white, age 10 to 24 years, and 25 years or older
withoutahighschooleducation.Censusvaluesfrom2010were
used for years of the study period.
Individual Covariates
Individual covariates included self-reported age, sex, race/
ethnicity(self-definedaswhite,black,Hispanic,Asian,multiple,
or other), and socioeconomic status, defined by highest paren-
taleducation(highschoolnotcompleted,highschoolgraduate/
equivalent, some college, 4-year college degree, or higher).
Statistical Analysis
Difference-in-difference estimates and associated tests were
conducted by comparing the change in past-month mari-
juana use and in perceived harmfulness of marijuana use from
3 years prior to RML (2010-2012) with the 3 years after RML
(2013-2015) in Washington and Colorado (included as sepa-
rate categories in the same model) vs contemporaneous
changes in the 45 contiguous states that did not pass RML. Ad-
justed prevalence estimates of marijuana use and of per-
ceived harmfulness of use, 95% CIs, and tests of difference-
in-difference contrasts were obtained from logistic regression
models, including a dichotomous time indicator (2010-2012
vs 2013-2015), a 3-category RML exposure indicator (Colo-
rado vs Washington vs non-RML as separate categories), the
interaction of time and the 3-category RML exposure indica-
tor, and all individual-, school-, and state-level covariates. Lo-
gistic regression models were estimated using generalized es-
timating equations controlling for clustering of individuals
within schools with robust standard error estimation. The pre-
dicted marginal approach was used to test risk differences be-
tween pre-RML and post-RML within Colorado and within
Washington and then to test difference-in-difference be-
tween these differences in Colorado and in Washington vs con-
temporaneous differences in other non-RML states.27
SUDAAN version 11.0 (RTI International) with PREDMARG
and PRED_EFF commands within RLOGIT was used for all
analyses, and the exact code is provided in the eAppendix in
the Supplement. Because sampling was conducted sepa-
rately by grade, regression models were fit stratified by grade
to provide grade-specific effects of RML.
Three sensitivity analyses were also conducted. First, we
examined frequency (ie, number of occasions) of marijuana
use in the past 30 days instead of any use vs none. Second, we
repeated regressions for marijuana use, limiting other states
to only include those that passed MML. Finally, we used a test
of trend in the 12 years prior to RML to validate the parallel-
path assumption28 for difference-in-difference estimators, ie,
that trends were not already differentially increasing in Colo-
rado and Washington prior to passage of the law.

ational marijuana use, perceived harmfulness decreased by
4.9% and 7.2% among eighth and 10th graders, respectively,
over the same period. These differences in trends between
Washington and non-RML states were significant (eighth grad-
ers: % [SD], −9.3 [3.5]; P = .01; 10th graders: % [SD], −9.0 [3.8];
P = .02). No difference was found among 12th graders in Wash-
ington or among students in any grade in Colorado compared
with non-RML states.
Table3andFigure2presenttheadjustedprevalenceofpast-
month marijuana use in 2010 to 2012 and 2013 to 2015 in Colo-

4.1%, respectively, during this time. In contrast, marijuana use
prevalenceamongeighthand10thgradersinstateswithnoRML
decreased by 1.3% and 0.9%, respectively, over the same pe-
riod. While the increase in marijuana use among eighth grad-
ers in Washington was not significantly greater than zero, the
significant decrease in use among eighth graders in non-RML
states suggests that if there had been no legalization in Wash-
ington, then marijuana use among eighth graders in this state
would decrease rather than remain stable, as it did. Difference-
in-difference tests indicated that these differences between
Washington and non-RML state trends were significant (eighth
graders:%[SD],5.0[1.9];P = .03;10thgraders:%[SD],3.2[1.5];
P = .007).Thechangeinmarijuanausewasconcentratedamong
nonusers (whose prevalence decreased) and regular (ie, 3 or
more times in the past 30 days) users (whose prevalence in-
creased) (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
No difference was found in the prevalence of marijuana
use among 12th graders in Washington or in Colorado in any
grade. Results were nearly identical when the reference states
were recoded as the other 20 MML states (eTable 2 in the
Supplement). No significant increasing trend in marijuana use
was found from 2001 to 2012 in Colorado or Washington com-
pared with other states (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Discussion
We assessed whether the perceived harmfulness of marijuana
use and prevalence of marijuana use changed in adolescents

in Colorado and Washington after legalization of adult recre-
ational marijuana use in 2012 in comparison with other states
that did not pass such legislation. Within Washington, the rate
of perceived harmfulness of marijuana use decreased and the
rate of past-month use increased among eighth and 10th grad-
ers following passage of RML, while there was no significant
change among 12th graders. Specifically, the prevalence of
regular users of marijuana increased and the prevalence of
nonusers decreased; no change was observed among occa-
sional users. In contrast, Colorado did not exhibit any change
in perceived harmfulness or past-month adolescent mari-
juana use following RML enactment. These findings remained
when the comparison states were limited to the 20 states that
have passed MML, indicating that the effects we found are
specific to legislation permitting recreational use.
To our knowledge, this is the first national empirical test
of a change in adolescent perceived harmfulness of mari-
juana and marijuana use associated with RML enactment.
The only other study that addressed these issues compared
marijuana use among 2 different cohorts of eighth graders in
Tacoma, Washington: one surveyed before RML and the
other immediately following RML.29 That study found
higher marijuana use in the second cohort, although the dif-
ference was not significant.29 The lack of a comparison group
limited inference about whether these findings were related
to RML.
The post-RML increase in adolescent marijuana use in
Washington could have several explanations. First, our find-
ings suggest that legalization of recreational marijuana use in
2012 reduced stigma and perceptions of risk associated with
marijuana use.20,21 A shift in social norms regarding mari-
juana use may have, in turn, increased marijuana use among
adolescents in Washington. Second, legalization may have
increased availability, increasing adolescent access to
marijuana indirectly through third-party purchases. Third,

legalization could have decreased the price of marijuana in the
black market,6,30 particularly after the first grower licenses in
Washington were issued in March 2014 and the first stores
opened in July 2014. The latter 2 mechanisms are less likely
explanations for the change in marijuana use observed in this
study, as grower licenses and stores did not start until 2014 and
our study ended in 2015. Fourth, the increase in marijuana use
observed in Washington could be due to other changes occur-
ring at the same time as RML rather than to RML itself. For ex-
ample, each school participates in the MTF for only 2 consecu-
tive years, suggesting that changes in marijuana use might be
partly because of school variation over the years. However, we
controlled for school characteristics and census-based state-
level demographic characteristics, and our use of pre-post dif-
ference-in-difference tests provides the basis for appropriate
conclusions about changes in marijuana use, assuming that
trends in non-RML states reflect what would have happened
in Colorado and Washington if they had not passed RML. Fu-
ture studies should examine the effects of specific implemen-
tation procedures and other possible mechanisms as expla-
nations for the observed increase in Washington after
additional post-RML years in Washington accumulate.31
The post-RML change in perceived harmfulness and mari-
juana use in Washington was focused among eighth and 10th
graders. The lack of change in perceived harmfulness among
12thgraderssuggeststhatonepotentialexplanationforthelack
ofchangeinmarijuanauseobservedamong12thgradersisthat
they already had formed attitudes and beliefs related to mari-
juana use prior to the enactment of RML. Hence, their mari-
juana use was less likely to change following RML. The rea-
sons behind an age-specific effect of RML on perceived
harmfulness and marijuana use should be further investi-
gated in future research.
We found no comparable change in perceived harmful-
ness or marijuana use in Colorado. This difference may be re-
lated to the different degree of commercialization of mari-
juana prior to legalization in Washington and Colorado.
Colorado had a very developed medical marijuana dispensary

system prior to legalization, with substantial advertising, to
whichyouthwerealreadyexposed.32Washington,ontheother
hand, did not provide legal protection to medical marijuana
stores. Therefore, the degree of commercialization and adver-
tising of these collectives was substantially lower than in Colo-
rado. In addition, rates of perceived harmfulness in Colorado
were already lower and rates of marijuana use were already
higher than rates in Washington and non-RML states prior to
legalization. Preexisting low levels of perceived harmfulness
and high levels of use may have constrained further short-
term increases following RML enactment. The longer-term ef-
fect of RML implementation on adolescent marijuana use in
Colorado is still to be determined. Further, approximately half
as many schools were included in the Colorado sample (17
schools) compared with the Washington sample (30 schools),
which may have limited power to detect an effect in Colorado,
particularly if the schools were located far away from mari-
juana dispensaries.
Limitations
Ourstudyhasseverallimitations.First,marijuanausewasself-
reported,leadingtopotentialresponsebiasassociatedwiththe
legalizationofmarijuana.However,thedatacollectionmethod
hasbeenvalidatedinpreviousmethodologicalstudies,andthe
assessment was conducted in confidential settings. Second,
MTF selects schools within regions of the country (with prob-
ability proportional to school size) rather than within states.
In the present study, students in 17 schools (28 school sur-
veys) in Colorado and 30 schools (47 school surveys) in Wash-
ington provided data across the 6 years. A greater number of
schools would have been advantageous, and the sample de-
sign may lead to discrepancies between MTF results and those
found in other large-scale surveillance efforts. Third, the study
does not include adolescents who were absent from school or
who have dropped out of school; these adolescents likely rep-
resentahigher-risksubsetofadolescents.23Inferencesarethus
restricted to school-attending adolescents, who comprise the
large majority of the US adolescent population. Fourth, analy-
ses are specific to the states of Washington and Colorado and
cannot be generalized to the rest of the United States. Fifth,
this study focused on marijuana; future studies should exam-
ine the effect of RML on other types of substance use.
Conclusions
Our study showed a significant decrease in the perceived harm
associated with marijuana use and an increase in past-month
marijuana use following enactment of RML among students
in eighth and tenth grades in Washington but not in Colo-
rado. Although further data will be needed to definitively ad-
dress the question of whether legalizing marijuana use for rec-
reationalpurposesamongadultsinfluencesadolescentuse,and
although these influences may differ across different legaliza-
tion models, a cautious interpretation of the findings sug-
gests investment in evidence-based adolescent substance use
prevention programs33-38 in any additional states that may
legalize recreational marijuana use.
