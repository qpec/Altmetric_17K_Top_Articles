Background/objective: Allergic diseases, such as bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, 
atopic dermatitis, and psychiatric disorders, are major health issues. There have been 
reports that allergic diseases were associated with depression or anxiety disorders. This 
study aimed to investigate the association between these allergic diseases and the risk 
of developing overall psychiatric disorders in patients from Taiwan.
Methods: This cohort study used the database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance 
Program. A total of 186,588 enrolled patients, with 46,647 study subjects who had 
suffered from allergic diseases, and 139,941 controls matched for sex and age, from the 
Longitudinal Health Insurance Dataset of 2000–2015, were selected from a sub-dataset 
of the National Health Insurance Research Database. Fine and Gray’s competing risk 
model analysis was used to explore the hazard ratio (HR), and 95% confidence interval, 
for the risk of allergic diseases being associated with the risk of developing psychiatric 
disorders during the 15 years of follow-up.
results: Of the study subjects, 5,038 (10.8%) developed psychiatric disorders when 
compared to 9,376 (6.7%) in the control group, with significant difference (p < 0.001). 
Fine and Gray’s competing risk model analysis revealed that the adjusted HR was 1.659 
(95% CI = 1.602–1.717, p < 0.001). In this study, we found that the groups of atopic 
dermatitis alone and the allergic rhinitis + atopic dermatitis were associated with a lower 
risk of psychiatric disorders, but all the other four groups, such as bronchial asthma 
alone, allergic rhinitis alone, bronchial asthma + allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma + atopic 
dermatitis, and the combination of all these three allergic diseases, were associated with 
a higher risk of psychiatric disorders.

inTrODUcTiOn
Child and adolescent allergic diseases, such as bronchial asthma, 
allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis, are common and have made 
an impact on the patients’ physical health (1–3). Furthermore, 
previous studies have shown the association between asthma 
and anxiety (4), depressive, bipolar, and overall mood disorders 
(5, 6), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (7, 8), 
schizophrenia (9), and even dementia (10). Some studies have 
also demonstrated the associations between allergic rhinitis 
and depressive disorder (11, 12) or bipolar disorder (13). The 
association between atopic dermatitis and depressive and anxiety 
disorders has also been reported (14). However, another study 
found that allergic diseases such as rhinitis or urticarial are asso-
ciated with a lower risk of schizophrenia (15). Therefore, a study 
is needed for the overall consideration of the association between 
these three common allergic diseases and important psychiatric 
disorders.
Psychiatric, or mental, disorders are defined as clinically 
significant behavioral or psychological syndromes, which are 
associated with present distress, disability, or an increased risk 
of suffering death, pain, or disability, and subsequent behavioral, 
psychological, or biological dysfunctions (16, 17). Previous stud-
ies have found that some psychiatric disorders are associated with 
several inflammatory diseases (18, 19), such as multiple sclerosis 
(20, 21), fibromyalgia (22, 23), or inflammatory bowel diseases 
(24). Psychological stressors related to these diseases might also 
contribute to both psychiatric and physical morbidity (25, 26).
Recent studies have been increasing on the interactions 
between allergy-related inflammatory or immunological fac-
tors and psychiatric disorders, such as depression (27), anxiety 
(28), bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia (29). However, further 
study is still needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the 
association between allergic diseases and psychiatric disorders. 
Nevertheless, the association between allergic diseases and 
psychiatric disorders has not, as yet, been studied. Therefore, a 
nationwide, population-based study is necessary for the associa-
tion between allergic diseases and the risk of psychiatric disorders 
for the clinicians who actually care for these patients.

Data sources
The National Health Insurance (NHI) Program was launched 
in Taiwan in 1995, and as of June 2009, included contracts with 
97% of the medical providers with approximately 23 million 
beneficiaries or more than 99% of the entire population (30, 31). 
The National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), 
which contains all the claims data of the beneficiaries, uses the 
International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical 
Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes to record diagnoses (32). The 
details of the program have been documented in previous studies 
(22, 33–42).
A subset of the NHIRD, Longitudinal Health Insurance 
Database of a two million randomized sampled population in 
2000–2015, was used to study the association between allergic 
diseases and the risk of psychiatric disorders. The present study 
used the NHIRD to identify patients with the diagnosis of aller-
gic diseases, based on the ICD-9-CM codes, such as bronchial 
asthma (ICD-9-CM: 493.x), allergic rhinitis (ICD-9 CM code 
477.X), and atopic dermatitis (ICD-9-CM code 691.X) during 
this period. The Institutional Review Board of the Tri-Service 
General Hospital approved this study and waived the need for 
individual written informed consent (IRB No. 2-105-05-040 and 
IRB No. 2-105-05-082).
study Design and sampled Participants
This study was of a population-based, matched-cohort design. 
Patients with newly diagnosed bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, 
or atopic dermatitis were selected from the Longitudinal Health 
Insurance Database from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2015. 
The patients with asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis 
before 2000 were excluded. This method could be viewed as a 
wash-out period to make sure all the allergic diseases were recent 
onset with references from other studies for the association 
between allergic diseases and psychiatric morbidity, using the 
NHIRD (6, 7, 11, 15). This wash out period method could avoid 
the carry-over bias from exposure to the pre-existing allergic 
diseases. In addition, the patients diagnosed with dementia, 
depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, bipolar 
disorders, sleep disorders, and psychotic disorders, before 2000, 
or before their first visit for asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic 
dermatitis were also excluded. Each enrolled patient was required 
to have made at least three outpatient visits within the 1-year 
study period for allergic diseases according to these ICD-9-CM 
codes. A total of the patients who were enrolled, including 46,647 
subjects with allergic diseases and 139,941 controls without aller-
gic diseases, were matched for age, sex, and index date (Figure 1).
covariates
The covariates included sex, age groups (<20, 20–49, ≥50 years), 
geographical area of residence (north, center, south, and east of 
Taiwan), urbanization level of residence (levels 1–4), and monthly 
income (in New Taiwan Dollars; <18,000, 18,000–34,999, 
and ≥35,000). The urbanization level of residence was defined 
according to the population and various indicators of the level of 
development. Level 1 was defined as a population of >1,250,000, 
and a specific designation as political, economic, cultural, and 
metropolitan development. Level 2 was defined as a population 
between 500,000 and 1,249,999 and as playing an important role 
conclusion: Allergic diseases are therefore associated with a 1.66-fold increased haz-
ard of psychiatric disorders in Taiwan.

in the politics, economy, and culture. Urbanization levels 3 and 4 
were defined as a population between 149,999 and 499,999, and 
<149,999, respectively (43).
comorbidities
Comorbidities were assessed using the Charlson Comorbidity 
Index (CCI), which categorizes the comorbidities using the 
ICD-9-CM codes, scores each comorbidity category (44–49), 
and combines all scores to calculate a single comorbidity score. 
A score of zero indicates that no comorbidities were found, and 
higher scores indicate higher comorbidity burdens (31).
Major Outcome
All of the study participants were followed from the index date 
until the onset of dementia (ICD-9-CM codes: 290.0, 290.10, 
290.11, 290.12, 290.13, 290.20, 290.21, 290.3, 290.41, 290.42, 
290.43, 290.8, 290.9, and 331.0), anxiety disorders (ICD-9-CM 
300), depressive disorders (ICD-9-CM 296.2–296.3, 300.4, and 
311), eating disorders (anorexia nervosa 307.1, bulimia nervosa 
307.51, and other disorders of eating 307.59), bipolar disorders 
(ICD-9-CM 296.0, and 296.4–296.8), sleep disorders (ICD-9-CM 
307.4 and 780.5), and psychotic disorders (ICD-9-CM 295 and 
297–298), withdrawal from the NHI program, or the end of 2015. 
In addition, each psychiatric diagnosis was required to have made 
at least three outpatient visits within the 1-year study period for 
psychiatric disorders according to these ICD-9-CM codes.
statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS for 
Windows, version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). χ2 and 
t tests were used to evaluate the distributions of the categorical 
and continuous variables, respectively, with a Fisher’s exact 
examination. Fine and Gray’s competing risk analysis was used 
to determine the risk of psychiatric disorders since death can act 
as a competing risk factor for psychiatric disorders (40, 50, 51). 
The results were presented as hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% 
confidence interval (CI). Differences in the risk of psychiatric 
disorders between the study and control groups were estimated 
using the Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test. A two-
tailed p value < 0.05 was considered to indicate the statistical 
significance.

Baseline characteristics of the study 
Population
The baseline characteristics of the study population are depicted 
in Table 1. There were 46,647 subjects in the allergic diseases 
group and 139,941 non-allergic diseases in the control group, 
with a similar distribution of sex, age, marital status, education 
years, and monthly insured premiums. The mean CCR (SD) 
for the subjects was 1.32 (1.10) and 0.67 (1.68) for the allergic 
diseases and control group, respectively. The subjects had more 
medical visits in the spring and winter, with residence in the 
south, east, and offshore islands of Taiwan, living in levels 3 and 
4 in urbanization, or seeking help in local hospitals than the 
control group (p < 0.001 for all). In the subjects with allergic 
diseases, 40,405 have asthma, 1,809, allergic rhinitis, and 4,433, 
atopic dermatitis.

allergic Diseases associated  
With Psychiatric Disorders
Of the study subjects, 5,038 (10.8%) developed psychiatric disor-
ders when compared to 9,376 (6.7%) in the control group, in the 
15-year follow-up. We have also examined the risk of psychiatric 
disorders associated with allergic diseases. After adjusting for age, 
sex, CCI scores, and all the covariates, the Fine and Gray’s survival 
analysis revealed that the adjusted HR for psychiatric disorders 
was 1.659 for the subjects (95% CI = 1.602–1.717, p < 0.001) 
when compared with the control group. With reference to the 
female subjects, the male subjects were associated with a higher 
risk of psychiatric disorders. With reference to the younger group 
(aged < 20 years), older age groups (aged 20–49 years and aged 
≥ 50 years) were associated with a higher risk of psychiatric dis-
orders (p < 0.001) (Table 2). Figure 2 shows the Kaplan–Meier 
analysis for the cumulative incidence of psychiatric disorders 
in the study subjects and the control groups (log-rank test, 
p < 0.001).
Furthermore, each single increased score of CCI was associ-
ated with a 2% increased risk of psychiatric disorders, and study 
subjects who sought medical help in the summer (adjusted HR 
0.914, p < 0.001), autumn (adjusted HR 0.748, p < 0.001), and 
winter (adjusted HR 0.921, p < 0.001) were associated with 
a lower risk of psychiatric disorders (data not shown). Study 
subjects who live in urbanization level 3 were associated with a 
lower risk of psychiatric disorders than those in level 4 (adjusted 
HR 0.817, p < 0.001). Study subjects who sought medical help in

association Between Different  
allergic Diseases and risk of 
Psychiatric Disorders
Table 3 reveals that the association between each group of allergic 
diseases and the individual psychiatric disorders using Fine and 
Gray’s competing risk model. The subjects with atopic dermatitis 
were associated with a decreased risk of overall and individual 
psychiatric disorders.
In addition, the patients with allergic diseases who live in 
the middle (adjusted HR: 1.118, p < 0.001), southern (adjusted 
HR: 1.055, p = 0.003), and eastern Taiwan (adjusted HR: 1.596, 
p < 0.001) showed slightly higher risk of psychiatric disorders, 
with reference of those who live in northern Taiwan. The patients 
who live in area of urbanization level 3 (adjusted HR: 0.763, 
p < 0.001) showed lower risk of psychiatric disorders, with refer-
ence of those who live in the urbanization level 4. The patients 
who sought for medical help in the hospital centers (adjusted 
HR: 0.504, p < 0.001) and regional hospitals (adjusted HR: 0.635, 
p < 0.001) showed lower risk of psychiatric disorders with the 
reference of local hospitals (Data not shown).
Table 4 reveals the adjusted HR of affective disorders (adjusted 
HR: 1.385, p = 0.001, in which depression with adjusted HR: 
1.412, p = 0.001, and bipolar disorders with adjusted HR: 1.124, 
p = 0.001), anxiety disorders (adjusted HR: 2.397, p = 0.009), 
psychotic disorders (adjusted HR: 1.192 p = 0.003), and dementia 
(adjusted HR: 1.193, p < 0.001) in patients with allergic diseases, 
when compared to the patients those without allergic diseases.
We divided the subjects with allergic diseases into six 
groups: bronchial asthma alone, allergic rhinitis alone, atopic 
dermatitis alone, bronchial asthma + allergic rhinitis, bronchial 
asthma + atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis + atopic dermatitis, 
and a combination of all these three allergic diseases. In this study, 
we found that the groups of atopic dermatitis alone and allergic 
rhinitis + atopic dermatitis were associated with a lower risk of 
psychiatric disorders, but the other four groups were associated 
with a higher risk of psychiatric disorders (Table 5).
risk of Psychiatric Disorders  
stratified by covariates
We analyzed the data by the stratification of the factors such as sex, 
age, marital status, education levels, urbanization level, geographic 
areas of residence, seasons of medical visits, monthly insured 
premiums, and levels of care from medical services providers. We 
found that the subjects, who were either male or female, married 
or not married, and in different educational years, urbanization 
levels, residence areas, seasons of visits, insured premiums, and 
levels of care, were associated with an increased risk of psychiatric 
disorders. In the different age groups, subjects aged < 20 years 
were associated with a lower risk of psychiatric disorder, while 
subjects in other age groups (≥20 years) were associated with a 
higher risk (Table 6).
hr analysis of Psychiatric Disorders  
in Patients With Different Medications  
for the Treatment of asthma
The different medications of treatment durations more than 
30 days for the treatment of bronchial asthma were grouped 
into four classes by the number of subjects who had used these 
medications: oral prednisolone, inhaled steroids, beta-agonist, 
aminophylline, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and anti-IgE

antibody (omalizumab). Oral prednisolone usage was associated 
with a lower risk of developing psychiatric disorders in bronchial 
asthma patients. Besides, usage of beta-agonist, aminophylline, 
and leukotriene receptor antagonists was also associated with 
a lower risk of developing psychiatric disorders while adjusted 
with all the covariates and comorbidities, either with or without 
prednisolone usage (Table 7).
DiscUssiOn
In this study, we examined the association between the overall 
allergic diseases and the risk of psychiatric disorders. After adjust-
ing the covariates, the adjusted HR was 1.659 for the subjects (95% 
CI = 1.602–1.717, p < 0.001) when compared with the control 
group. In other words, the adult patients with allergic diseases 
had a 1.66-fold increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders. 
The Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that the study subjects had 
a significantly higher 15-year psychiatric disorders-free survival 
rate than the controls.
Bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis were associated with 
the risk of overall psychiatric disorders, but atopic dermatitis was 
associated with a lower risk of psychiatric disorders. Bronchial 
asthma was associated with the risk of individual psychiatric 
disorders, such as dementia, anxiety disorders, depressive dis-
orders, eating disorders, bipolar disorders, sleep disorders, and 
psychotic disorders, but allergic rhinitis was associated with a 
lower risk of dementia and an increased risk of other psychiatric 
disorders. However, the increasing number of allergic diseases 
was associated with an increased risk of psychiatric disorders. 
In comparison to the previous studies for individual allergic 
diseases in several psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety disor-
ders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, and 
ADHD (4, 6–8, 10–15, 43), this is the first study on the topic of 
the association of allergic diseases and the broader spectrum of 
psychiatric disorders. Atopic dermatitis seems to be an exception 
in these allergic diseases, by being associated with a lower risk of 
psychiatric disorders, even though previous reports found that 
atopic dermatitis are associated with ADHD and autism spec-
trum disorders (52–55). Further study is needed to clarify the 
association between atopic dermatitis and the risk of psychiatric 
disorders.
The results of this study showed the association between over-
all allergic diseases and the risk of psychiatric disorders, which 
echoed the findings of other studies on the association between 
the overall allergic or atopic diseases and the risk of psychiatric

disorders: for example, children with eczema, asthma, or hay fever 
had more emotional, conduct, and hyperactivity problems in a 
cross-sectional study in Denmark (56), and atopic diseases might 
be associated with an elevated risk of developing depression in a 
birth cohort study in Finland (57). Several studies have reported 
the associations between bronchial asthma or other atopic diseases 
and psychiatric disorders, such as affective disorders, anxiety 
disorders, schizophrenia, substance-related disorders, autism-
spectrum disorders, or ADHDs (9, 58–62). Some researchers 
have also reported the associations between atopic dermatitis and 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or speech disorders in 
childhood (63), and the association between allergic rhinitis and 
the risk of suicides and depression (64). Furthermore, parental 
exposure to occupational asthmagens might also be associated 
with children autism-spectrum disorders (65). Previous studies 
have also reported the associations between other immune or 
inflammation-related diseases, such as periodontitis (66), gluten-
related illnesses (67), amyotrophiclateral sclerosis (68), psoriasis 
(69), food or other allergies (70), and idiopathic environmental 
intolerance (71) and the risk of psychiatric disorders. Conversely, 
psychiatric disorders might also affect the immune systems (72). 
In this study, the overall allergic diseases were associated with 
affective disorders, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, and 
dementia, respectively. The interplay between allergic diseases 
and psychiatric disorders, therefore, warrant further study.
The underlying mechanism of the association between allergic 
diseases and psychiatric disorders remains unclear. The “orches-
tration” of the pro-inflammatory cytokines plays an important 
role in the pathogenesis of allergy-related diseases, such as asthma 
(73). Reports have shown that cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-
6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), IL-10, and monocyte 
chemoattractant protein-1/CCL2 might be well associated with 
depressive, bipolar, or anxiety disorders (74, 75). Reports also 
show that dementia is related to peripheral pro-inflammatory 
factors released by periodontal inflammatory mediators such 
as C-reactive protein, IL-6, haptoglobin, TNF-α, and fibrinogen 
(76–78). Furthermore, some studies have also found that inflam-
mation play an important role in eating disorders (79, 80) and 
sleep disorders (81–83).
Additionally, we have included several psychosocial factors 
in the analysis, such as marital status, educational level, monthly 
insured premiums, urbanization level, and residence. In com-
parison to the allergy-disease subjects who sought medical help 
in the local hospitals, study subjects who received medical help 
from medical centers or regional hospitals were associated with 
a lower risk of psychiatric disorders. These findings suggest that 
disadvantageous socioeconomic factors might well contribute to 
the risk of psychiatric disorders.
We found that the study subjects of those aged < 20 years had 
a lower risk in developing psychiatric disorders. We therefore 
hypothesize that the reason for a lower risk is that the maximal 
follow-up time is 15 years, which might not have, as yet, reached 
the age of onset of the most major psychiatric disorders for the 
patients of allergic diseases (84). Further study is needed to clarify 
the association between age and the risk of psychiatric disorders 
in the patients with allergic diseases.
Furthermore, we found that oral prednisolone usage was 
associated with a lower risk of developing psychiatric disorders in 
bronchial asthma patients. Moreover, the usage of beta-agonist, 
aminophylline, and leukotriene receptor antagonists was also 
associated with a lower risk of developing psychiatric disorders, 
with or without prednisolone usage. The mechanisms and effects

of these medications on the risk of psychiatric disorders in bron-
chial asthma patients merit further study.
limitations
The present study has several limitations that warrant consid-
eration. First, similar to previous studies using the NHIRD on 
allergic diseases as aforementioned, not all the data were recorded 
in the NHIRD, and we were unable to evaluate the severity, weak-
ness severity, laboratory parameters, or lung function examina-
tions in asthma patients. Second, other factors, such as genetic, 
psychosocial, and environmental factors, were not included in the 
dataset. Third, for patients who have to pay for their own for over-
the-counter drugs for the allergic diseases, their self-medications 
would not have been included in the NHIRD. There is no study 
about the rates of self-medications for these allergic diseases. 
However, due to the high coverage of medical providers (97%) 
and beneficiaries (more than 99%) of the NHI system in Taiwan, 
most of the people would ask for help from the NHI-contracted 
hospital or clinics for their allergic diseases.
strength of This study
One of the primary strengths of this study is the use of ICD-9 
codes, and a number of studies have demonstrated the accuracy 
and validity of several diagnoses in the NHIRD, including DM 
(85, 86), cancer (87–89), myocardial infarction (85, 90, 91), and 
central nervous system diseases, such as Tourette syndrome 
(92), and stroke (85, 93–95), outcomes (89), mortality (85, 96), 
or comorbidity (89, 96). In a wide spectrum of conditions, 
some studies have also demonstrated the concordance between 
Taiwan’s National Health Survey and the NHIRD on various diag-
noses (97), medication usage (97), and health system utilizations 
(97, 98). Correspondingly, the long-term observation period 
from 2000 to 2015 allowed for more credibility, when compared 
with other similar studies, to propose physical mechanisms and 
plausible hypotheses. Finally, and most importantly, we have tried 
to explain the mutual biological and psychological mechanism 
between the allergic diseases and the psychiatric disorders.
cOnclUsiOn
We have evaluated the risk of psychiatric disorders in associa-
tion with the allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, 
and atopic dermatitis in Taiwan’s population, using the 
representative population-based data. We have demonstrated 
that the patients with allergic diseases were at a significantly 
higher risk of psychiatric disorders than the control group. 
Further studies are therefore needed for patients with allergic 
diseases not only to prevent its clinical exacerbation but also 
to decrease the possibility of developing psychiatric disorders. 
We sincerely hope that this study will provide the necessary 
information for an earlier intervention for patients with aller-
gic diseases.
