Abstract.
Previous experimental studies have demonstrated that a number of mosquito-borne flavivirus pathogens
are vertically transmitted in their insect vectors, providing a mechanism for these arboviruses to persist during adverse
climatic conditions or in the absence of a susceptible vertebrate host. In this study, designed to test whether Zika virus
(ZIKV) could be vertically transmitted, female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus were injected with ZIKV, and their
F1 adult progeny were tested for ZIKV infection. Six of 69 Ae. aegypti pools, comprised of a total of 1,738 F1 adults,
yielded ZIKV upon culture, giving a minimum filial infection rate of 1:290. In contrast, none of 803 F1 Ae. albopictus
adults (32 pools) yielded ZIKV. The MFIR for Ae. aegypti was comparable to MFIRs reported for other flaviviruses
in mosquitoes, including dengue, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, West Nile, and St. Louis encephalitis viruses.
The results suggest that vertical transmission may provide a potential mechanism for the virus to survive during
adverse conditions.
INTRODUCTION
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus in
the family Flaviviridae. During the past decade, ZIKV has
moved from the status of an obscure arthropod-borne virus
(arbovirus) of little public health importance to the position of
a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).1–3
Apart from reports of sexual and congenital transmission in
humans, the primary transmission cycle of ZIKV is thought to
involve primates (nonhuman as well as human) and certain
species of Aedes mosquitoes.1,2 The available data indicate
that there are two cycles of ZIKV; a sylvan cycle involving
nonhuman primates and forest-dwelling mosquitoes, and an
urban/suburban cycle involving humans and Aedes aegypti and,
to a lesser extent, Aedes albopictus.1,2 In this regard, the sylvan
and urban cycles of ZIKV are similar to those described for
dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and chikun-
gunya virus, the three other arboviral pathogens that are also
transmitted by Ae. aegypti in their urban cycles.4–6
Since the declaration of the current Zika epidemic as a
PHEIC, ZIKV research has focused mainly on the pathogen-
esis, genetics, molecular biology, and structure of the virus, with
the goal of developing improved diagnostic methods, vaccines,
therapeutics, and effective methods of disease prevention.3 In
contrast, much less research effort has been directed at the
mosquito component of the ZIKV life cycle, specifically fac-
tors affecting vector competence, transmission efficiency, and
long-term maintenance of the virus.
One of the basic questions that has long puzzled arbo-
virologists is how arboviruses persist during adverse environ-
mental conditions (cold periods in temperate regions and hot
dry seasons in tropical zones) when adult vectors, such as
mosquitoes, are absent or in very low numbers.7 Vertical
(transovarial or transovum) transmission (VT) of a virus
from female insects directly to their progeny is one mecha-
nism for arbovirus maintenance in nature during adverse
environmental conditions. VT can also maintain a virus in a
specific locality, when most of the potential vertebrate hosts
are immune, either as a result of vaccination or natural infec-
tion. There is both field and laboratory evidence that many
arboviruses are vertically transmitted in their natural arthro-
pod vectors, including some of the major flaviviruses such as
DENV, YFV, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), St. Louis
encephalitis virus (SLEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and tick-
borne encephalitis virus.7 There is also evidence that many
of the insect-specific nonpathogenic flaviviruses are also main-
tained by VT in their natural mosquito hosts.8,9
Given this background, we undertook laboratory studies
to determine if ZIKV is vertically transmitted in Ae. aegypti
and Ae. albopictus. This report describes results of our pre-
liminary studies, demonstrating that ZIKV is vertically trans-
mitted by infected Ae. aegypti females to some of their
progeny, thus providing a potential mechanism for the virus
to be maintained during adverse climatic conditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mosquitoes. Two established laboratory colonies of Ae. aegypti
and Ae. albopictus at the University of Texas Medical Branch
were used in this study. The progenitors of the Ae. aegypti colony
were originally obtained from Bangkok, Thailand; the progen-
itors of the Ae. albopictus colony were originally collected in
Maracaibo, Venezuela. Both colonies were determined to be
free of insect-specific viruses (ISVs) by culture in C6/36 cells,
next-generation sequencing, and transmission electron micros-
copy, since previous studies8,9 have shown that some mosquito
laboratory colonies are infected with ISVs that may reduce
the infectivity and replication of a second heterologous flavi-
virus by superinfection exclusion. Mosquitoes were reared in
an insectary, maintained at 27°C with 80% relative humidity
and a 16-hour light/8-hour dark photoperiod.
Virus. The virus used in the experiments was ZIKV strain
MEX I-44. This virus was originally isolated from a pool of Ae.
aegypti mosquitoes collected in Chiapas, Mexico, in December
2015 and had been passaged three times in Vero cells.
Infection of mosquitoes. Approximately 100 female mos-
quitoes of each species were inoculated intrathoracically10 with
a ZIKV stock containing 106 plaque forming units (PFU)/mL.
Infected mosquitoes were held in screened cages (BioQuip
Products, Gardena, CA) within a plastic glove box at 27°C and
maintained on 10% sucrose solution. Ten days after infection,
mosquitoes were fed defibrinated sheep blood, using a Hemotek
membrane feeding system (Discovery Workshops, Accrington,
United Kingdom), as per manufacturer’s instructions. After

 feeding, approximately 50 blood-engorged females were
removed from the cage and transferred into four cylindrical
5-L cardboard containers with fine netting on top, each con-
taining a 50-mL beaker holding moist paper toweling for ovi-
position.10 Cotton balls saturated with 10% sucrose solution
were placed on top of the containers as an energy source. Six
days after the blood meal, when many eggs were present on the
moist paper, it was removed from the cage and dried for storage.
Ten of the surviving female mosquitoes of both species were
removed from the cages and frozen for subsequent titration.
Virus assay on mosquitoes. Eggs from the first oviposition
of the infected Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus females were
hatched and the emerging larvae reared to adults, using stan-
dard procedures10 in an insectary maintained at 27°C. The F1
adult offspring from the infected parents were collected and
frozen at −80°C. Frozen F1 adult mosquitoes were subsequently
thawed and sorted into pools of 25 insects (both sexes) each.
Mosquito pools were then homogenized in 1.0 mL phosphate-
buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 20% fetal bovine serum with
penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 mg), using a
TissueLyser (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). After centrifugation at
10,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was passed through
a 0.20-μm nylon syringe filter (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh,
PA); then 150 μL of each supernatant filtrate was inoculated
into separate 12.5-cm2 flask cultures of C6/36 cells, originally
obtained from the American Type Culture collection (Manassas,
VA). After 2 hours of absorption at 28°C, 5.0 mL of main-
tenance medium was added to each flask. Cultures were held
in an incubator at 28°C for 7 days. On the seventh day, some
of the cells were scraped from the plastic surface, and spotted
onto Cel-Line 12-well glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA) for examination by indirect fluorescent anti-
body technique (IFAT),11 using a specific mouse hyperimmune
polyclonal antibody prepared against ZIKV strain MR 766,
obtained from the World Reference Center for Emerging
Viruses and Arboviruses.
RNA extraction and quantitative real-time reverse tran-
scription polymerase chain reaction. RNA extraction from
the ZIKV-infected parent female mosquitoes was performed
using a combination of TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies)
and Qiagen protocols, as we have previously optimized the
combination of these protocols to yield high-quality and
high-integrity RNA.12 After extraction, all RNA samples
were quantified spectrophotometrically using a NanoDrop
ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific). A real-time primer/probe set specific for ZIKV MR766
(Prototype, Uganda, 1947, GenBank accession no. AY632535)13
was synthesized by IDT Technologies (Coralville, IA) with
5′FAM as a reporter dye for the probe. Quantitative and
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
steps were performed with iScript One-Step RT-PCR Kit
for Probes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using the manufac-
turer’s protocol and an iCycler (Bio-Rad). For absolute
quantification, a standard curve was constructed with 10-fold
dilutions of RNA extracted from a sample of known infec-
tivity of 2.03 × 106 PFU determined by plaque assay in Vero
E6 cells. Amplification efficiency of the reaction was 100.7%
with a correlation coefficient of 0.99. A linear equation was
generated by plotting the threshold cycle (CT) values of the
standard curve and the log of the viral concentration. Viral
load CT values from the mosquito samples were determined
by real-time PCR and converted to log10 PFU equivalents per
mosquito, using the linear equation determined for the stan-
dard curve.12
RESULTS
Virus load in parent females. Ten of the parent female
mosquitoes of each species (Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus)
were frozen for testing 10 days after infection with ZIKV
and 6 days after their first blood meal (total of 16 days
postinfection). Each mosquito was tested individually by
RT-PCR, as described above, and the viral load was calcu-
lated as log10 PFU per insect. The mean virus titer in the 10
Ae. aegypti females was 6.13 log10 PFU/mosquito (standard
deviation [STDEV] = 0.57 log10). Mean virus titer in the 10 Ae.
albopictus females was 6.35 log10 PFU/mosquito (STDEV =
0.45 log10).
Testing F1 progeny for ZIKV infection. A total of 69 pools
consisting of 1,738 F1 adult Ae. aegypti were tested. Six of
the 69 pools were IFAT-positive (Figure 1), indicating that
one or more of the F1 progeny in the pool were infected with
ZIKV. Based on these results, we estimated a minimum
ZIKV filial infection rate of 1:290 for the experimentally
infected Ae. aegypti. None of the 32 Ae. albopictus pools,
comprising 803 adults, were positive in the IFAT.
DISCUSSION
The observation that ZIKV was vertically transmitted
by infected Ae. aegypti females to some of their F1 off-
spring is not unexpected, in view of the results of other
studies of VT with flavivirus pathogens in their mosquito
vectors.14–27 Table 1 summarizes the results of selected pub-
lished studies of VT of nine flavivirus pathogens by mosqui-
toes. In these studies, the parent female mosquitoes were
infected by intrathoracic inoculation; although this is not a nat-
ural route of infection, the technique insures that all of the
females are infected. In contrast, infection of mosquitoes by
the oral route requires high titers of virus and the results are
more variable. However, even in experiments in which 100%
of the parent females were infected, the filial infection rates in
their F1 offspring varied widely, depending upon the mosquito

 species and geographic strain used, the virus type and strain
used, the mosquito developmental stage tested (immature or
adult), the virus assay method, the larval rearing temperature,
the interval between initial infection and the first blood meal,
and the ovarian cycle of F1 offspring examined.14–27 For
example, several studies16,17,20,22,25 have compared the filial
infection rates of DENV, JEV, or SLEV in multiple geo-
graphic strains of a single mosquito species (i.e., Ae. aegypti,
Ae. albopictus, or Culex quinquefasciatus) and have reported
marked differences in the infection rates of their F1 progeny.
Similarly, other studies16,22–24 have compared the filial infec-
tion rates among different mosquito species after infection with
a single flavivirus type. Alternatively, other studies16,17,22,26
have compared filial infection rates in a single mosquito colony
experimentally infected with multiple strains of a single flavi-
virus type. In each case, considerable variation was observed in
filial infection rates among F1 progeny of the infected female
parents. Two studies also reported that lowering the larval rear-
ing temperature to 18°C instead of 27°C significantly increased
the filial infection rates of mosquitoes infected with SLEV
.16,23–25
Two other studies26,27 examined the filial infection rates
among progeny of individual infected female mosquitoes, and
these also varied widely. In summary, experimental studies of
VT of flaviviruses in mosquitos have given highly variable
results, indicating that there are multiple factors (variables)
that can affect the frequency of VT and the resulting filial
infection rates in female mosquitoes infected with flaviviruses
pathogens. If such variability occurs in laboratory studies that
are performed under relatively controlled conditions, then it
must be even greater in nature. Consequently, one should
interpret the results of such laboratory studies with caution, as
they simply demonstrate that VT of these flavivirus pathogens
can occur. But the critical question is “does VT occur in
nature”? Answering this question is a much more difficult
problem, as one would have to collect immature forms (i.e.,
larvae and pupae) or adult males of the vector species in an
area where the virus of interest is endemic or epidemic and to
demonstrate that they are infected.
Another potential variable is the presence of ISVs. The
earlier experimental studies mentioned above and in Table 1
were performed at a time when most of the mosquito-
specific flaviviruses were still unrecognized,8,10 consequently
the infection status of the mosquito colonies used, with regard
to mosquito-specific viruses, was unknown. Available evidence
now indicates that mosquito-specific flaviviruses are common
in nature and in laboratory mosquito colonies.8,10 These
viruses are also maintained by VT in their insect hosts and at
much higher filial infection rates than the flavivirus vertebrate
pathogens.8,10 The effect of these ISVs on the vector compe-
tence of their mosquito hosts is uncertain and may represent
another important variable affecting VT of flavivirus arboviral
pathogens, such as ZIKV, DENV, YFV, JEV, SLEV, and
WNV.8,10 One potential effect of prior infection of a mosquito
with an insect-specific flavivirus is superinfection exclusion (or
homologous interference), a process by which cells infected with
one virus do not support replication of the same or a similar
virus.9 This phenomenon has been observed during infection of
both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts with a broad range of
viruses, including some of the mosquito-specific flaviviruses.9
Consequently, the absence or presence of mosquito-specific
flaviviruses in a laboratory mosquito colony potentially could
also alter the VT rate of a flavivirus pathogen in that colony.
In view of the relatively low filial infection rates observed
with ZIKV and other flavivirus pathogens (Table 1), one

VERTICAL TRANSMISSION OF ZIKA VIRUS IN MOSQUITOES
 might conclude that VT is of little epidemiologic importance.
With the low filial infection rates observed in those experi-
mental studies, mathematical models28,29 predict that flavi-
virus pathogens such as ZIKV, DENV, YFV, or WNV would
survive for only a few generations without horizontal trans-
mission and amplification in a vertebrate. However, VT rates
in this range may be sufficient to allow a flavivirus to persist
during hot dry periods or cold weather, when adult vectors
are absent or in low numbers.29 Many Aedes species, includ-
ing Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, produce resistant eggs
that can survive for months (or longer) in a dried dormant
state.30,31 Although adults may not survive a winter or dry
season, when favorable environmental conditions return, the
eggs hatch and larvae emerge to complete the insect’s life
cycle and to establish a new generation. As the larvae pass
through various developmental stages and grow, the virus
also replicates, so that by the time an infected adult female
emerges, she is infectious and able to transmit the virus.
Venereal transmission is another mechanism by which a
virus can be amplified in a mosquito population. Although
male mosquitoes do not take blood, they can acquire virus
by VT from an infected female parent. In experimental stud-
ies, infected male mosquitoes can transmit virus horizontally
to noninfected adult females during mating as well as to her
developing oocytes, resulting in infected F1 progeny.7,32
Another mechanism for virus to be maintained in an insect
population is the stabilized infection model, as described with
Sigma virus (Rhabdoviridae) in Drosophila melanogaster.33 In
this condition, the virus is maintained by VT at a high level in
nature by relatively few infected females. Stabilized infections
have been demonstrated in several Aedes mosquito species with
California encephalitis serogroup viruses (Orthobunyavirus:
Bunyaviridae).34,35
Because of these alternative methods of virus transmission, the
importance of VT should not be discounted, based solely on low
filial infection rates observed in experimental laboratory studies.
Knowledge of the transmission mechanisms of arboviruses
in their vertebrate and invertebrate hosts continue to evolve.
ZIKV was once thought to be transmitted to humans solely
by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The recent pandemic in
the South Pacific and the Americas has shown that other
modes of human infection can occur (venereal, congenital,
postpartum, and blood transfusion).1,2 The classical concept
that arboviruses are maintained in nature by continual trans-
mission between susceptible vertebrate hosts by hematopha-
gous arthropods is also outdated and incomplete, as alternative
mechanisms for virus maintenance within the vector population
have been described. ZIKV is probably no exception. As a
survival strategy, a successful parasite (in this case an arbo-
virus) might be expected to have alternative maintenance
mechanisms to insure its survival during periods when suscep-
tible vertebrate or arthropod hosts are not available. The alter-
native maintenance mechanisms (survival strategies) for ZIKV
in its mosquito hosts is a neglected area of research, but this
information is essential if we want to fully understand the ecol-
ogy of ZIKV and to eventually control it.
