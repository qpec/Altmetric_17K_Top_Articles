Metformin Effect on Nontargeted
Metabolite Profiles in Patients With
Type 2 Diabetes and in Multiple Murine
Tissues
Diabetes 2016;65:3776–3785 | DOI: 10.2337/db16-0512
Metformin is the first-line oral medication to increase
insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Our aim was to investigate the pleiotropic effect of
metformin using a nontargeted metabolomics approach.
We analyzed 353 metabolites in fasting serum samples
of the population-based human KORA (Cooperative
Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) follow-up
survey 4 cohort. To compare T2D patients treated with
metformin (mt-T2D, n = 74) and those without antidiabe-
tes medication (ndt-T2D, n = 115), we used multivariable
linear regression models in a cross-sectional study. We
applied a generalized estimating equation to confirm the
initial findings in longitudinal samples of 683 KORA par-
ticipants. In a translational approach, we used murine
plasma, liver, skeletal muscle, and epididymal adipose
tissue samples from metformin-treated db/db mice to
further corroborate our findings from the human study.
We identified two metabolites significantly (P < 1.42E-04)
associated with metformin treatment. Citrulline showed
lower relative concentrations and an unknown metabolite
X-21365 showed higher relative concentrations in human
serum when comparing mt-T2D with ndt-T2D. Citrulline
was confirmed to be significantly (P < 2.96E-04) de-
creased at 7-year follow-up in patients who started met-
formin treatment. In mice, we validated significantly (P <
4.52E-07) lower citrulline values in plasma, skeletal mus-
cle, and adipose tissue of metformin-treated animals
but not in their liver. The lowered values of citrulline
we observed by using a nontargeted approach most
likely resulted from the pleiotropic effect of metformin on
the interlocked urea and nitric oxide cycle. The translational
data derived from multiple murine tissues corroborated and
complemented the findings from the human cohort.
Metformin became the first-line choice for treatment of
type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the course of the UK Prospective
Diabetes Study (UKPDS) (1). Additionally, metformin has

 been reported to have other pleiotropic effects; e.g., it reduces
insulin resistance (2), improves the uptake of glucose in mus-
cle (3,4), reduces the risk for cancer (5), and lowers the values
of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) (6). The underlying mechanism of
the reduction of LDL-C is, at least in part, due to the activa-
tion of the AMPK in the liver (7). Apart from that, AMPK
affects several processes such as nitric oxide (NO) production
by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) (8), which is also stimu-
lated by metformin (9). However, the mode of action of
metformin is not completely understood (10–12).
Our previous study was based on a targeted metabolo-
mics approach to explore the effects of metformin on lipid
profiles in the population-based KORA (Cooperative Health
Research in the Region of Augsburg) cohort (6,13,14).
Irving et al. (15) recently reported decreased levels of argi-
nine and citrulline as an effect of insulin sensitizer therapy
in 12 metformin- and pioglitazone-treated individuals and
13 placebo-treated control subjects. Nontargeted metabo-
lomic measurements have been applied to investigate hy-
perglycemia (16,17) and the effects of metformin treatment
in individuals without diabetes (18). However, none of the
previous nontargeted metabolomics studies investigated
metformin treatment in patients with T2D.
In this study we focused on serum metabolites asso-
ciated with metformin treatment based on a nontargeted
approach in a human population from the KORA cohort.
A cross-link from human to mice was corroborated in
multiple tissues (plasma, liver, skeletal muscle, and epi-
didymal adipose tissue) from a mouse study. Biologically
relevant pathways for the identified metabolites were
analyzed using bioinformatical approaches.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Ethics Statement
All participants gave written informed consent. The KORA
study was approved by the ethics committee of the Bavar-
ian Medical Association, Munich, Germany.
Approval for Mouse Study
Within this study, all mice were bred and housed in a
temperature- and humidity-controlled environment in com-
pliance with Federation of European Laboratory Animal
Science Associations protocols. Animal experiments were
approved by the District Government of Upper Bavaria
(Regierung von Oberbayern, Gz.55.2–1-54–2531–70–07,
55.2–1-2532–153–11).
KORA Cohort
KORA is a population-based cohort study conducted in
southern Germany (14). The baseline survey 4 (KORA S4)
consists of 4,261 individuals (aged 25–74 years) examined
between 1999 and 2001. During the years of 2006 to
2008, 3,080 individuals took part in the follow-up survey
4 (KORA F4). Clinical data for each participant were re-
trieved from medical records. On the basis of fasting glu-
cose, 2-h postglucose load, and physician-validated and
self-reported diagnoses, KORA participants were classified
according to the World Health Organization diagnostic cri-
teria. A further grouping of patients with T2D was based
on information on medication (19,20) (Table 1). Only
participants with metabolite measurements were included
in the present analysis (Metabolon, n = 1,768 in KORA
F4). We excluded 1) participants with overnight nonfast-
ing serum samples (n = 8), 2) patients suffering from type 1
diabetes and drug-induced (e.g., via steroids) diabetes
(n = 6), 3) T2D patients treated with insulin (n = 16) or
both insulin and metformin (n = 13), and 4) patients
taking glucose-lowering oral medication other than met-
formin (n = 17). Furthermore, participants with isolated
impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (n = 77) were excluded.
We have previously shown that IFG and impaired glucose
tolerance (IGT) should be considered as two different
phenotypes (21).
In KORA F4, we focused on four groups: 1) partici-
pants with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), 2) individuals
with prediabetes with IGT, 3) T2D patients without glucose-
lowering treatment (non-antidiabetes drug treated, ndt-
T2D), and 4) metformin-treated T2D (mt-T2D) patients
(Table 1).
The same exclusion and classification criteria were used
in the longitudinal analyses. We only considered partic-
ipants with metabolite measurements in both studies (KORA
S4 and F4, n = 818), and we excluded at both time points 1)
participants with overnight nonfasting serum samples (n =
88), which included patients suffering from type 1 diabetes
or drug-induced diabetes, 2) participants taking oral glucose-
lowering medication other than metformin (n = 11), 3) par-
ticipants undergoing insulin treatment (n = 3), and 4)
participants with a missing diabetes status (n = 33). The
remaining 683 participants were ndt-T2D individuals with
prediabetes and healthy control subjects at KORA S4, 37 of
whom started metformin treatment at KORA F4.

 The data from KORA S4 and F4, including metabolite
concentrations with clinical phenotypes, are available
upon request through the platform KORA-PASST (project
application self-service tool) (www.helmholtz-muenchen
.de/kora-gen).
Blood Sampling
In the KORA cohort study, blood was drawn into Monovette
serum tubes (Sarstedt AG & Co., Nümbrecht, Germany) in
the morning between 8:00 A.M. and 10:30 A.M. after at least
8 h of fasting. Tubes were gently inverted twice, followed
by resting 30 min at room temperature to obtain com-
plete coagulation. For serum collection, blood was centri-
fuged at 2,750g at 15°C for 10 min. Serum was filled into
synthetic straws, which were stored in liquid nitrogen
(2196°C) until metabolomic analyses.
Nontargeted Metabolite Profiling
The serum samples from participants of KORA S4 and F4
were measured with the Metabolon analytical system
(Metabolon, Inc., Durham, NC). Metabolon applied a
nontargeted semiquantitative liquid chromatography–
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) platform
for the identification of structurally named and unknown
molecules (22,23). We measured 363 (including 109 un-
known) metabolites in fasting serum samples from KORA
S4. In the 7-year KORA F4, 353 metabolites (including
107 unknown) were determined (24).
In this study, we applied the same criteria for quality
control as described by Albrecht et al. (25). In brief, me-
tabolites with more than 20% missing values were ex-
cluded, as were samples with more than 10% missing
metabolites (25). All normalized relative ion counts were
log transformed, and the remaining data were imputed
with Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations
(MICE) (26). We used 363 metabolites in KORA S4 and
353 metabolites in KORA F4 (Supplementary Table 1).

Metformin and Metabolite Profiles in T2D
Diabetes Volume 65, December 2016
 F4 was 312. Metabolite names were used according to
Shin et al. (27); however, the identity of metabolite ID
M32654 and the molecule “3-dehydrocarnitine*” could
not be confirmed. We therefore used the name X-21365
(Supplementary Table 1).
Each metabolite was standardized with a mean of zero
and an SD of one in each study after the exclusion of non-
fasting participants.
Metformin Mouse Intervention Study
Pharmacological studies were conducted in 20 male 8-week-
old diabetic BKS.Cg-Dock7m+/+ Leprdb/J (db/db) mice that were
bred and housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled
environment in compliance with Federation of European
Laboratory Animal Science Associations protocols. To ex-
clude estrous cycle–related influences on metabolic param-
eters, only male mice were included in this study. From
age 3 weeks, all mice were fed a high-fat diet (S0372-
E010; ssniff Spezialdiäten, Soest, Germany) containing
(gm%) palm fat (13.5), sunflower oil (13.5), starch (30),
saccharose (10), casein (20), lignocellulose (5), mineral+
vitamin mix (5+2), safflower oil (0.5), and linseed oil
(0.5) to manifest a uniform diabetic phenotype. Animals
received either vehicle (5% solutol/95% hydroxyethylcel-
lulose) without (n = 10) or with metformin (300 mg/kg;
Sigma Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany; n = 10) via gavage
once daily between 5:00 and 6:00 P.M. before dark-phase
onset (6:00 P.M.) for 14 days. At 18 6 2 h after the last
treatment, 4-h fasted mice were sacrificed with an iso-
flurane overdose, and organs and blood were immedi-
ately collected (4). Murine plasma was prepared from
whole blood by centrifugation at 4°C, and tissues were
freeze-clamped; both were stored at 280°C until further
analyses. All samples were measured with the Metabolon
analytical system. Metabolites with more than 20% miss-
ing values were excluded, as were samples with more
than 10% missing metabolites (25). All normalized rela-
tive ion counts were log transformed, and the remaining
data were imputed with MICE (26). Linear regression
was done on metabolite values for metformin-treated mice
as the cases as well as for the nonmetformin-treated,
vehicle-gavaged mice as the controls. A metabolomics
examination was done for plasma, liver, skeletal muscle,
and epididymal adipose tissue (Table 5 and Fig. 1B).
Statistical Analysis
To evaluate the effect of metformin treatment on certain
metabolites, multivariable linear regression models were
conducted with the relative metabolite concentration
values as outcome and the grouping variable as predictor.
Each metabolite was assessed individually. To consider
potential risk factors and confounding parameters with
known effect on metabolite profiles (6,13,28–32), two
models were used: 1) adjusted for age and sex as the crude
model and 2) adjusted for age, sex, BMI, physical activity,
high alcohol intake, smoking status, systolic blood pres-
sure (BP), HbA1c, fasting glucose, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C),
and triglycerides as well as the use of statins, b-blockers,
ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) as
the full model. The association of conventional risk factors
of T2D as well as other population characteristics with met-
formin treatment was calculated via x2 test for categorical
variables. Shapiro–Wilk test was applied to test continuous
variables for normal distribution (P # 0.05 for nonnormally
distributed variables, P . 0.05 for normally distributed var-
iables), followed by Student’s t test for normally distributed
continuous variables and Wilcoxon test for nonnormally
distributed continuous variables.
To account for multiple testing for the linear models,
Bonferroni correction was applied, and only metabolites
with P , 0.05/353 = 1.42E-04 were considered to be
statistically significantly different in KORA F4. In addi-
tion, we calculated the adjusted P value with the false
discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamini-Hochberg
method, which is not as stringent as the Bonferroni cor-
rection. For the full linear models, participants were ex-
cluded because of missing information of considered
confounders. This led to 1,138 NGT (after exclusion of
five individuals because of missing confounding informa-
tion), 272 IGT, 114 ndt-T2D (after exclusion of one indi-
vidual because of missing confounding information), and
70 mt-T2D (after exclusion of four individuals because of
missing confounding information) participants.
In the KORA S4 to F4 longitudinal study (S4 → F4),
generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to val-
idate the significant metabolites in both crude and full
models.
All statistical analyses were performed in R (version
3.2.2) (33).
Pathway Analysis
Pathways were explored using databases, considering tissue
and organ specificity. The link from observed significant
metabolites to the interacting enzymes was drawn using
the Human Metabolome Database (34). Protein–protein
interactions were analyzed with the Search Tool for the
Retrieval of Interacting Genes (35) and the Kyoto Encyclo-
pedia of Genes and Genomes (36). To consider drug-related
effects of metformin on certain targets, we used DrugBank
(37). The link between metformin targets and the protein
network was analyzed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (36).
RESULTS
Population Characteristics of Human and Mouse
Studies
On the basis of the available nontargeted metabolomic
profiles, our human discovery study, KORA F4, includes
1,143 NGT, 272 IGT, 115 ndt-T2D, and 74 mt-T2D partic-
ipants (Table 1). Among the four groups, mt-T2D patients
were the oldest, were more frequently men, and had the
highest values of HbA1c, fasting glucose, triglycerides, BMI,
and waist circumference (Table 1).
The longitudinal KORA study includes samples of 683
participants without metformin treatment at baseline,

 37 of whom were treated with metformin in the 7-year
follow-up (Table 2).
From the metformin-treated mice, we obtained 10 sam-
ples for plasma, liver, and epididymal adipose tissue and
9 samples for skeletal muscle. In the same amount of
vehicle-gavaged control mice, we obtained 10 samples for
plasma, liver, epididymal adipose tissue, and skeletal
muscle.

Metformin and Metabolite Profiles in T2D
Diabetes Volume 65, December 2016
 Two Metabolites Are Associated With Metformin
Treatment in a Human Cross-sectional Study
Two out of the 353 used metabolites (citrulline and
X-21365) were found to be significantly (P , 1.42E-04)
associated with metformin treatment when comparing
mt-T2D with ndt-T2D patients in the cross-sectional
KORA F4 study (Table 3 and Fig. 1A). Using multivari-
able linear regression models, we detected negative
b-estimates for both the crude (b = –0.75, P = 2.31E-
05) and full adjustment (b = –0.79, P = 2.54E-05) for

 citrulline. Hence, the relative concentration of citrulline is
significantly lower in mt-T2D compared with ndt-T2D
patients. By contrast, the relative concentration of X-21365
was significantly higher in mt-T2D patients than in ndt-T2D
patients (Table 3 and Fig. 1A). When applying the FDR, no
additional associations were found to be significant in both
crude and full models (Supplementary Table 3). When apply-
ing a significance cutoff of P , 0.05 to the comparison of
mt-T2D with ndt-T2D for the models with crude and full
adjustment, 44 additional metabolites were found, including
ornithine, arginine, and urea (Supplementary Table 3).
Five additional pairwise comparisons between the four
groups (NGT, IGT, ndt-T2D, mt-T2D) confirmed that these
two metabolites are specific for metformin treatment and
not due to the progression of the disease. The relative
concentration of citrulline was significantly lower in the
mt-T2D than in the NGT and IGT groups, whereas the
concentration of X-21365 was significantly higher (Fig. 1A
and Supplementary Table 2). Consistently, neither of the
two metabolites showed a significantly different relative
concentration in the pairwise comparisons among the
three groups without metformin treatment, i.e., NGT,
IGT, and ndt-T2D (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table 2).
The Spearman correlation coefficient between the two
metabolites was low (r = 0.06). We observed similar asso-
ciations between the two metabolites with a number of
risk factors of T2D (20.19 , r , 0.19) when considering
189 individuals with ndt-T2D and mt-T2D in KORA F4
(Supplementary Fig. 1).
Metformin Treatment Is Associated With Decreased
Blood Citrulline Values in a Human Longitudinal Cohort
The two metformin-associated metabolites were further
investigated in the prospective KORA study. In 37 patients
who started metformin treatment during the 7-year follow-
up, citrulline was found to be significantly (Bonferroni cutoff
for two identified metabolites P , 0.05/2 = 0.025) decreased
in longitudinal in both the crude (b = –0.67, P = 2.03E-05)
and the full model (b = –0.61, 2.96E-04, Table 4). In the
same group, X-21365 was significantly increased in the
crude (b = 0.41, P = 5.62E-03) but not in the full model
(b = 0.16, P = 0.374, Table 4).
Lower Citrulline Relative Concentrations in Plasma,
Skeletal Muscle, and Epididymal Adipose Tissue
Confirmed in Metformin-Treated Mice
We observed significantly lower plasma citrulline relative
concentrations in db/db mice following daily, subchronic
metformin treatment compared with the vehicle-gavaged
control mice (b = –0.39, P = 2.56E-07, Table 5 and Fig. 1B),
which is consistent with the results observed in humans. In
addition, we found significantly lower values of citrulline in
both skeletal muscle (b = –0.35, P = 1.79E-09) and epidid-
ymal adipose tissue (b = –0.26, P = 4.52E-07). However,
citrulline values in the liver did not differ between the
metformin-treated and vehicle-gavaged non–metformin-
treated db/db animals (b = –0.02, P = 0.258, Table 5 and
Fig. 1B). Significantly different relative concentrations of
X-21365 were not found in plasma, skeletal muscle, epidid-
ymal adipose tissue, or liver of metformin-treated mice
when compared with the controls (Table 5 and Fig. 1B).
DISCUSSION
We found significantly lower values of citrulline and
significantly higher values of X-21365 in the serum of
T2D patients who underwent metformin treatment com-
pared with the nontreated patients. Additionally, using
longitudinal settings, we observed that the values of citrulline
significantly decreased in patients after they started metfor-
min treatment during the follow-up. A mouse intervention
study using metformin confirmed the lower values of
citrulline in plasma, as well as in skeletal muscle and
epididymal adipose tissue, but not in liver. Citrulline is a
nonproteinogenic amino acid, the product of anabolic and
the substrate of catabolic processes (38,39). It is synthe-
sized from arginine by releasing NO, which is involved in
the regulation of numerous processes in the nervous sys-
tem, the immune system, and the cardiovascular system
(8). Additionally, citrulline is produced from ornithine in
the urea cycle (38). We observed ornithine, urea, and argi-
nine to be lowered in human serum (Fig. 1C). Consistently,
in our previous study, which was based on a targeted
metabolomics approach, ornithine was found to be signif-
icantly lower in the metformin-treated T2D patients of the

Metformin and Metabolite Profiles in T2D
Diabetes Volume 65, December 2016
 KORA F4 study. Citrulline was not measured in the tar-
geted panel we used (6).
Metformin activates AMPK in the liver and muscle
(7,40). AMPK in turn may stimulate eNOS by its phos-
phorylation (8,41), which suggests a consequent increase
of the NO production in the NO cycle (Fig. 1C). It is
known that elevated production of NO is reflected by in-
creased values of citrulline in urine (42), as citrulline can
be used as a surrogate marker for NO (43). The decreased
values of citrulline and its precursors in blood, skeletal
muscle, and epididymal adipose tissue, as were observed
in our study, are most likely due to an accountable, in-
creased excretion of this metabolite. However, urine sam-
ples were not available in this study. To confirm this
assumption, further studies are necessary.
Furthermore, the lower values of citrulline and arginine
we observed are likely to be a consequence of the activation
of eNOS. In the NO cycle, eNOS catalyzes the reaction from
arginine to citrulline, thereby releasing NO (9,38). NO in
turn has beneficial cardiovascular effects. The reason is that
NO influences smooth muscles and activates their relaxation
(44). This underlies the clinical practice guidelines, which
have recommended the use of metformin as first-line ther-
apy in T2D patients with cardiovascular disease, mainly in
patients with observed reduced NO levels (45). Additional
intake of citrulline to compensate for the lower values of
citrulline and arginine might even increase the beneficial
effects of metformin on cardiovascular disease (46).
Additionally, citrulline is synthesized in the urea cycle,
which is strongly interlocked with the NO cycle (Fig. 1C).
In mammals, both cycles primarily take place in the liver,
but they also take place in the kidney (47). The same
accounts for the NO cycle, in which arginine also plays an
important role. In fact, similar effects of metformin on the
urea and NO cycle were mentioned by Irving et al. (15).
Their study design focused on plasma samples of 25 male
overweight or obese participants. Furthermore, all 12
metformin-treated participants were additionally treated
with pioglitazone (15). Our findings in multiple tissues of
mice that were exclusively treated with metformin and in
serum of 189 T2D patients enable a deeper understanding
of the underlying mode of action for metformin.
The observation that the citrulline values are not
affected in the liver of metformin-treated mice is pre-
sumably a consequence of the hepatic localization of the
consecutive production of citrulline in both the NO and
the urea cycle (38), which conserves a state of equilibrium.
This is in line with observations in a recent study (18).
Furthermore, significantly decreased ornithine values
were found in plasma of individuals without diabetes (18).
Apart from the NO and urea cycles, there are additional
physiological processes that produce citrulline. The metab-
olite is also synthesized from other amino acids. Examples
of such precursors are glutamine, which is converted in the
enterocytes, proline, and glutamate (38). However, we did
not observe any significant concentration difference for
these metabolites in our human cohort.

 X-21365 was not found to be significantly higher in the
fully adjusted longitudinal analyses of the KORA S4 → F4
cohort, although it was significant in both cross-sectional
analyses and in the longitudinal analyses with crude ad-
justment. In mice, we did not observe significant differ-
ences of X-21365 in any of the examined tissues. Recent
advances in the identification of metabolites spectra sug-
gest that this unknown metabolite (X-21365) might be
5-trimethylaminovalerate and therefore closely related
to the gut microbiome, which is in line with a recent study
(48). Additional studies using both blood and stool sam-
ples have to be conducted to confirm this.
The values of metabolites in humans of the KORA
study are influenced by multiple factors such as age, sex,
BMI, lifestyle, clinical measurements, and medication
(6,13,28–32). We therefore considered these factors in
the models underlying our cross-sectional discovery and
longitudinal investigations in a human cohort. Consider-
ing the mouse study, there was no need for a comparable
adjustment, as the animals were kept under strict labora-
tory conditions.
Because of the physiological similarity, we used data
from a mouse study not only to corroborate our findings
in humans but to extend our investigations on other
tissues. However, our findings are limited by the compar-
ison of metabolic analytes in two different blood matrices
and species: human serum and mouse plasma. In theory,
the analytical method could be affected by the difference in
matrix, and delicate analytes could deteriorate during the
prolonged preparation time of serum compared with that
of plasma. Therefore, a direct comparison between the
matrices serum and plasma has limitations (49). With
respect to this, we compared the serum metabolites
only within humans, the plasma metabolites only within
mice, and each mice tissue separately (50). The observa-
tional nature of cohort studies and the applied methods
are of purely statistical character, yet still they offer the
opportunity to identify unknown coherences and to de-
sign study settings to confirm underlying mechanisms.
Because of the fact that NO is below the mass cutoff
imposed on the instruments, our investigations did not
contain measurements of this chemical compound. Nev-
ertheless, our observations suggest further investigations
with a specific design to address the involvement of the
NO and urea cycle in metformin treatment.
In summary, we observed that serum values of citrulline
were reduced under metformin treatment in human
patients with T2D and, in a translational approach, also in
plasma, skeletal muscle, and epididymal adipose tissue of
diabetic mice. The underlying mechanism is most likely
the metformin-induced activation of AMPK and its
consequent increase of eNOS activity, which is linked
to citrulline by the NO cycle.
