abstract
BACKGROUND: Children in child care centers represent an important population to consider in 
attempts to mitigate the spread of an influenza pandemic. This national survey, conducted 
in 2008 and 2016, assessed directors’ reports of their child care centers’ pandemic 
influenza preparation before and after the 2009 H1N1 novel influenza pandemic.
METHODS: This was a telephone-based survey of child care center directors randomly selected 
from a national database of licensed US child care centers who were queried about their 
preparedness for pandemic influenza. We grouped conceptually related items in 6 domains 
into indexes: general infection control, communication, seasonal influenza control, use 
of health consultants, quality of child care, and perceived barriers. These indexes, along 
with other center and director characteristics, were used to predict pandemic influenza 
preparedness.
RESULTS: Among 1500 and 518 child care center directors surveyed in 2008 and 2016, 
respectively, preparation for pandemic influenza was low and did not improve. Only 
7% of directors had taken concrete actions to prepare their centers. Having served as a 
center director during the 2009 influenza pandemic did not influence preparedness. After 
adjusting for covariates, child care health consultation and years of director’s experience 
were positively associated with pandemic influenza preparation, whereas experiencing 
perceived barriers such as lack of knowing what to do in the event of pandemic influenza, 
was negatively associated with pandemic influenza preparedness.
CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic influenza preparedness of child care center’s directors needs 
to improve. Child care health consultants are likely to be important collaborators in 
addressing this problem.

WhaT’s KnOWn On ThIs subjecT: This is the first 
report of child care center director preparedness for 
pandemic influenza. Addressing pandemic influenza in 
children in child care centers is important due to high 
morbidity and mortality, efficient droplet spread, and 
transmission to household contacts.
WhaT ThIs sTuDy aDDs: This study demonstrates 
a general lack of pandemic influenza preparedness 
among child care center directors driven in large 
part by gaps in knowledge. Use of Web-based training 
and child care health consultants are promising 
approaches to address this problem.

About one-quarter of all children 
<5 years of age in the United States 
regularly attend organized group 
early education and child care in 
settings such as child care centers, 
preschools, and Head Start1 and 
are at higher risk for influenza. An 
influenza pandemic occurs when 
a new strain of influenza, to which 
the majority of the population is not 
immune, gains the ability to spread 
from person to person, and then 
advances globally. The most recent 
influenza pandemic occurred in 2009 
involving influenza A H1N1. Public 
health officials try to mitigate spread 
in early stages of a pandemic by using 
nonpharmaceutical interventions 
such as respiratory etiquette, hand 
hygiene, and social distancing. 
Because influenza is spread primarily 
through droplets, and children 
<5 years of age do not effectively 
practice these nonpharmaceutical 
interventions, the options for 
preventing spread in these settings 
are limited. Seasonal influenza 
vaccination would be ineffective early 
in a pandemic because the virus is 
novel, requiring time to engineer and 
distribute a new vaccine. In severe 
influenza epidemics or pandemics, 
school or child care program closures 
may be recommended.
Recognizing the potential for an 
influenza pandemic and the critical 
role that early education and child 
care centers play in the spread into 
communities, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) 
developed resource materials in 2006 
to prepare these centers.2 A random 
national sample of licensed child care 
center directors was queried in 2008 
regarding their preparedness for 
pandemic influenza just before the 
influenza A H1N1 pandemic occurred 
in 2009 and a follow-up survey was 
conducted in 2016. We present the 
findings of these surveys and provide 
recommendations for enhancement 
of strategies aimed at reducing 
transmission of pandemic influenza 
in child care centers.
MeThODs
survey Development
We developed survey domains 
and content in 2008 with a 
multidisciplinary group that 
included an American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP) staff person (L.A.), 
a researcher (L.S.), a pediatrician 
(T.R.S.) with expertise working with 
infectious diseases in child care 
centers, and other child care national 
experts. We also used content from 
a pandemic influenza preparedness 
(PIP) checklist for child care 
providers developed by the CDC.2 
We piloted items with a small group 
of child care center directors and 
content was modified to improve face 
validity.
Data source and Participants
The Wolfgang Frese Survey 
Laboratory at the Social Science 
Research Center at Mississippi State 
University conducted nationwide 
telephone-based surveys of directors 
of licensed child care centers 
(including preschools and Head 
Start programs) in 2008 and 2016. 
Before administering each survey, 
we compiled databases of all licensed 
child care centers in the United States 
by requesting contact information 
from individual state licensing 
agencies, if the information was not 
readily available via states’ Web 
sites. Eligible centers were currently 
licensed by the state and had to be 
considered a child care center or 
child care program affiliated with 
a school. We excluded home-based 
family child care programs. We 
contacted centers by telephone and 
removed them from the database 
for the following: incorrect/
disconnected numbers, poor 
connections, no longer in business, 
and not meeting screening criteria. 
Interviews were conducted with the 
center directors and were ∼15 to 20 
minutes in length. Samples sizes were 
determined by available funding. 
In 2008, to complete 1500 surveys, 
we drew a simple random sample of 
8664 cases from a database of 97 000 
child care centers. In 2016, to reach 
518 completed surveys, we drew 
a simple random sample of 2500 
cases from a database of 180 000 
centers. A refusal was a respondent 
who initiated the questionnaire, 
then terminated the call at any point 
before completion. Cooperation rate 
was calculated as (No. completed 
surveys)/(No. completed surveys 
+ No. refusals). This study was 
reviewed and approved by the 
institutional review boards of the 
following: the AAP, Naval Medical 
Center Portsmouth, Mississippi 
State University, and University of 
Pittsburgh.
Measures
We grouped conceptually related 
items in 6 domains into indexes 
that might be associated with 
preparedness for pandemic 
influenza: general infection control, 
communication, seasonal influenza 
control, use of health consultants, 
quality of child care, and perceived 
barriers. These domains are 
described below. We counted each 
item within an index as 1 point. The 
full list of items in each index can 
be found in Supplemental Table 6 
along with the 2016 questionnaire in 
Supplemental Information.
General Infection Control
The General Infection Control 
Index assessed directors’ level of 
competency with general infection 
control measures. We generated the 
index by summing positive responses 
to 8 items (7 in 2008) capturing 
disease surveillance and infection 
control such as documentation of 
illness in the center, use of daily 
health checks, use of written 
exclusion criteria, and training of 
staff members on infection control.
Communication
The Communication Index assessed 
directors’ level of communication 
about illness or infections at their 
center. We computed the index 
2

www.aappublications.org/news
Downloaded from 
 PEDIATRICS Volume 139, number 6, June 2017
by summing positive responses to 
3 items: whether directors share 
information with parents about 
illness, use social media for health-
related issues, or use social media to 
communicate with families. Because 
the social media items were not 
included in the 2008 survey, the 
index used for the 2008 was a single-
item index.
Seasonal Influenza Immunization
The Influenza Immunization Index 
gauged whether directors’ required 
seasonal influenza immunization. 
We comprised the 2-item index 
by summing positive responses 
about whether the directors’ center 
required immunizations for children 
and adult staff, respectively.
Use of Health Consultants
A child care health consultant is a 
licensed health professional with 
some training or experience in 
pediatrics who works with early 
childhood education programs to 
address health and safety issues. 
We captured the use of health 
consultants by centers by using a 
5-item Consultant Index summing 
responses about the use of a health 
consultant, using written agreements, 
using paid consultants, frequency of 
telephone advice (at least monthly), 
and frequency of consultant visits to 
the center (at least monthly).
Quality of Child Care
The Quality Indicators Index 
consisted of a 2-item index assessing 
whether the program was, or was 
in the process of being, accredited 
by an organization like the National 
Association for the Education 
of Young Children (NAEYC) and 
whether the director met minimum 
qualifications on the basis of AAP 
guidelines contained in Caring for 
Our Children standard 1.3.1.1, 
3 
which combines minimum director 
education, minimum experience, and 
number of children at the center.
Barriers
We generated a Barriers Index from 
7 items that might have prevented 
directors from being prepared 
for pandemic influenza: lack of 
knowledge, not knowing where 
to find information, not knowing 
what to do, not having the time, 
and lacking the resources, and any 
other barrier not listed (specified by 
respondent).
Other Potential Predictor Variables
Items collected but not included in 
the indexes were as follows: centers’ 
racial composition, whether the 
center was a designated Head Start 
facility, average center attendance, 
and directors’ years of experience. 
We determined racial composition by 
asking center directors to respond to 
the question, “Among the children in 
your center, what racial background 
is most common?” We also queried 
respondents whether they were 
working in their current center 
during the 2009 H1N1 influenza 
pandemic.
Outcome: PIP
We constructed the primary 
outcome, the directors’ reported 
level of preparedness for pandemic 
influenza, from an index of positive 
responses to 4 items: concern about 
pandemic influenza, having been 
contacted about pandemic influenza, 
planning for pandemic influenza, and 
preparation for pandemic influenza.
analytic approach
We used Stata/SE 14 (StataCorp, 
College Station, TX) for statistical 
analyses. We used descriptive 
statistics to assess the characteristics 
of child care centers, directors’ 
qualifications and backgrounds 
and their associations with PIP 
scores in 2008 and 2016. We used 
independent samples t tests to 
compare means of continuous 
variables and Pearson χ2 tests to 
compare proportions across groups 
or time points. We used multiple 
variable regression analysis to 
assess the influence of general 
infection control, communication, 
seasonal influenza immunization, 
the use of health consultants, and 
the presence of barriers on PIP 
scores. We adjusted models for 
racial composition of the center 
(African American, Latino/Latina, 
other race, or those lacking a single 
most common race to predominantly 
white population, which we used as 
the reference category), Head Start 
status, directors’ years of experience, 
and whether the director worked 
in the same center before the 2009 
influenza pandemic. We developed 
separate regression models for the 
2008 and 2016 samples. Missing 
data were handled by using listwise 
deletion. Due to the number of 
missing cases, we also analyzed 
data by using multiple imputation 
with no meaningful change in the 
results. The final analytic sample for 
the regression models included 910 
cases for 2008 and 350 for 2016.
ResulTs
The cooperation rate for 2008 
and 2016 was 44.4% and 59.0%, 
respectively (P < .001).
child care center and Director 
characteristics
Descriptive statistics of child care 
center directors and their centers are 
displayed in Table 1. The proportion 
of NAEYC accredited, or accreditation 
in-process, centers in the sample was 
significantly lower in 2016 than in 
2008 (38% vs 44%, P < .05). The self-
reported age distribution of centers 
was significantly different in 2016 
with a higher proportion of children 
ages 0 to 6 weeks (11% vs 9%) and 
a higher percentage of children older 
than 25 months (21% vs 10%, P < 
.001). Directors were more likely 
to report having a degree in early 
childhood or child development in 
2016 compared with 2008 (77% 
vs 72%, P < .05). Finally, directors 
had a mean of 1 additional year of

experience in 2016 than in 2008 (19 
vs 18 years, P < .05).
Trends in PIP
 
Table 2 summarizes the individual 
items comprising the PIP index in 
2008 and 2016. A positive response 
to any of the 4 items was assigned 
a point yielding a possible range 
of 0 to 4; higher scores represent 
greater PIP. Responses to individual 
items were similar in 2008 and 
2016 with the exception of having 
been contacted about pandemic 
influenza, which was more likely in 
2008 (11.5% vs 4.9%, P < .001). On 
average, respondents in each year 
received just over 1 point (1.16) on 
the PIP index.
 
Table 3 reveals the proportion of 
respondents who indicated engaging 
in 6 different activities related to 
pandemic influenza preparation. 
Overall, only 7% of directors 
reported engaging in any preparation 
for pandemic influenza each year. 
However, there was a small but 
significant increase in the proportion 
of respondents who reported using 
a checklist to prepare for pandemic 
influenza (3.6% vs 6.4%, P < .01).
Predictors of PIP
 
Table 4 reveals the mean PIP scores 
in 2008 and 2016 by select child care 
center and director characteristics. 
Directors from centers that were 
NAEYC accredited/in process of 
accreditation had significantly 
higher mean PIP scores in both 
2008 (P < .01) and 2016 (P < .01). 
Directors from Head Start sites had 
significantly higher mean PIP scores 
only in 2008 (P < .001). Directors 
with higher education levels (P < 
.05) and degrees in early childhood 
education (P < .01) had significantly 
higher mean PIP scores in 2008 and 
nearly so in 2016. In 2008, directors 
with more years of experience had 
higher mean PIP scores (P < .001).
 
Table 5 reveals multiple regression 
analyses for 2008 and 2016 
predicting PIP scores using indexes 
of general infection control, 
communication, seasonal influenza 
immunization, the use of health 
consultants, and the presence of 
barriers, as well as various director 
and center-level characteristics. 
Overall, the regression model 
accounted for 17% of the variation

in PIP scores in 2008 and 15% of the 
variation in 2016. Of the indexes, 
the Consultant and Barriers Indexes 
were significantly associated with 
PIP. Higher Consultants Index was 
significantly associated with  
higher PIP in 2008 (P < .001) and  
2016 (P < .01). In contrast, higher  
Barriers Index was significantly  
associated with lower PIP in 2008  
(P < .001) and 2016 (P < .01). In 2008, 
identifying as a Head Start program 
was significantly associated with 
higher PIP (P < .01). In 2016, centers 
with higher average attendance 
were significantly associated with 
higher PIP (P < .05). Finally, in both 
2008 and 2016, directors’ years 
of experience was significantly 
associated with higher PIP (P < .001 
and P < .01, respectively). Based 
on the standardized coefficients 
(β), use of health consultants and 
having barriers were the strongest 
predictors of PIP in the models.
DIscussIOn
We found that PIP was low and 
changed very little from 2008 to 
2016 in a national sample of US 
licensed child care center directors, 
despite the 2009 pandemic. 
Directors’ previous experience 
with pandemic influenza did not 
influence their PIP. Few directors 
had undertaken any definitive 
action related to preparedness for 
pandemic influenza. Center and 
director characteristics commonly 
associated with higher quality child 
care, such as NAEYC accreditation, 
Head Start status, directors’ higher 
education levels, and degree in early 
education or child development, 
were associated with higher PIP in 
univariate analysis. However, after 
adjusting for covariates, the most 
important and only independent 
predictors of PIP in both survey 
years were use of a child care health 
consultant, directors’ years of 
experience, and perceived barriers.
Because barriers such as not knowing 
what to do and lacking resources 
were negatively associated with PIP, 
it is important to evaluate what PIP 
training/materials were available to 
directors at the time of these surveys.

pandemic influenza planning for 
child care centers in 2006.2 Updates 
and more recommendations were 
refined by the CDC and AAP in 
February 2009 and 2010, after 
the influenza pandemic.4 
– 
6 These 
recommendations were available 
on the Internet and disseminated 
through various electronic 
distribution lists. Despite this effort, 
most directors apparently were not 
aware of and/or did not implement 
them. Our study did not evaluate 
whether the messaging reached 
the intended audience, and if it did, 
whether it was not implemented 
due to complexity, conflicting health 
beliefs and priorities, or other 
reasons. It will be important to 
further explore the barriers directors 
report because they are potentially 
modifiable.
Given the low pandemic influenza 
knowledge and preparedness of 
child care center directors, in a 
future pandemic (as occurred in 
the 2009 pandemic) pediatric 
health care providers will likely be 
consulted by concerned parents 
who have questions about how to 
avoid pandemic influenza, exclusion 
policies, and possible center closures. 
Pediatric health care providers 
should be aware that there are CDC 
recommendations for pandemic 
influenza mitigation in child care 
settings.
To our knowledge, there are no 
previous reports of PIP in child 
care centers. It is well-established 
that children in group child care 
spread infectious diseases, including 
seasonal and pandemic influenza, at 
higher rates than children in other 
settings because of their interactive 
play and unlikeliness to practice 
social distancing, hand hygiene, 
and respiratory etiquette.7 Young 
children experience high morbidity 
and mortality from seasonal 
influenza, and this was also seen in 
the 2009 pandemic influenza.8 
– 
10 
Influenza viral shedding lasts 
significantly longer in younger 
children than adults, over one-
half of children are still shedding 
influenza at 8 days after onset of 
illness, posing important questions 
about the appropriate length of time 
for exclusion.11, 
 
12 Young children 
spread influenza to families and the 
community at significant rates and 
child care attendance independently 
increases this risk.10, 
 
13 Unfortunately, 
infection control interventions to 
reduce the spread of respiratory and 
influenzalike illness in center-based 
child care have a relatively small 
impact.14 
– 
17 Finally, the inability to 
attend child care due to exclusion 
or closure of the center results 
in the need for alternative care 
arrangements or missed parental 
work, which has a large societal 
economic impact.18, 
 
19 For these 
reasons, it is both important and 
difficult to address PIP for children in 
child care centers.
The findings of this study suggest 
that efforts to increase PIP among 
US child care center directors should 
focus on increasing awareness and 
knowledge of pandemic influenza 
by developing more effective ways 
of distributing information and 
conducting training. Child care 
health consultants, used by over 
40% of centers in both survey 
years, are effective at increasing 
and implementing health promotion 
policies and practices20, 
 
21 and 
should be used for this purpose. 
Encouragingly, directors became 
more interested in receiving training 
about pandemic influenza between 
2008 and 2016. Although paper-
based and in-person training remain 
popular choices, receiving Internet-
based self-directed or webinar-based

training were the preferred methods 
in 2016 and represent an efficient 
way to deliver training.
The strengths of this study are 
the use of national sampling of 
licensed US child care centers and 
adjusting for covariates to identify 
independent predictors of PIP. This 
study is based on director self-report, 
rather than direct observation of 
practices, and could be influenced 
by social desirability bias although 
preparedness levels were so low that 
this is unlikely to be a large issue. 
The sample populations differed 
significantly in that the source 
databases grew significantly from 
2008 to 2016. This likely represents 
better accounting by states of active 
centers over this time period because 
the number of children using child 
care centers changed very little 
according to the most recent US 
Census Bureau reports.1, 
 
22 There 
were significant demographic and 
center director differences (Table 1) 
in the 2 survey years; however, this 
was adjusted for in multivariable 
analyses. Finally, the cooperation 
rate was higher in 2016 than 2008, 
possibly due to greater knowledge 
of pandemic influenza (respondents 
with at least some knowledge of 
pandemic influenza: 63.3% vs 
46.9%, respectively). This could have 
introduced selection bias; however, 
if such a bias existed, one might have 
expected higher PIP in 2016.
cOnclusIOns
Pandemic influenza is a potentially 
devastating global health event, and 
young children in child care centers 
are a vulnerable group that can 
augment the spread of pandemic 
influenza into the community. 
Therefore, it is important to have 
strategies in place for mitigating 
pandemic influenza in these settings. 
Based on our findings, we recommend 
addressing child care center director 
knowledge gaps about PIP by 
developing Internet-based webinars 
and self-paced trainings and by 
using child care health consultants 
to promote them. Because ongoing 
educational efforts have not been 
successful, policymakers may consider 
requiring PIP training for licensure 
or accreditation. Pediatric health care 
providers should be aware of child 
care center directors’ lack of PIP and 
steer parents and center directors 
toward CDC resources to help mitigate 
the spread.
