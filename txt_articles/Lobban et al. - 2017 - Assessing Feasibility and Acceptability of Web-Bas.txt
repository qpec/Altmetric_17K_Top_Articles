Abstract
Background: Interventions that teach people with bipolar disorder (BD) to recognize and respond to early warning signs (EWS)
of relapse are recommended but implementation in clinical practice is poor.
Objectives: The objective of this study was to test the feasibility and acceptability of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to
evaluate a Web-based enhanced relapse prevention intervention (ERPonline) and to report preliminary evidence of effectiveness.
Methods: A single-blind, parallel, primarily online RCT (n=96) over 48 weeks comparing ERPonline plus usual treatment with
“waitlist (WL) control” plus usual treatment for people with BD recruited through National Health Services (NHSs), voluntary
organizations, and media. Randomization was independent, minimized on number of previous episodes (<8, 8-20, 21+). Primary
outcomes were recruitment and retention rates, levels of intervention use, adverse events, and participant feedback. Process and
clinical outcomes were assessed by telephone and Web and compared using linear models with intention-to-treat analysis.
Results: A total of 280 people registered interest online, from which 96 met inclusion criteria, consented, and were randomized
(49 to WL, 47 to ERPonline) over 17 months, with 80% retention in telephone and online follow-up at all time points, except at
week 48 (76%). Acceptability was high for both ERPonline and trial methods. ERPonline cost approximately £19,340 to create,
and £2176 per year to host and maintain the site. Qualitative data highlighted the importance of the relationship that the users
have with Web-based interventions. Differences between the group means suggested that access to ERPonline was associated
with: a more positive model of BD at 24 weeks (10.70, 95% CI 0.90 to 20.5) and 48 weeks (13.1, 95% CI 2.44 to 23.93); increased
monitoring of EWS of depression at 48 weeks (−1.39, 95% CI −2.61 to −0.163) and of hypomania at 24 weeks (−1.72, 95% CI
−2.98 to −0.47) and 48 weeks (−1.61, 95% CI −2.92 to −0.30), compared with WL. There was no evidence of impact of ERPonline
on clinical outcomes or medication adherence, but relapse rates across both arms were low (15%) and the sample remained high
functioning throughout. One person died by suicide before randomization and 5 people in ERPonline and 6 in WL reported ideas
of suicide or self-harm. None were deemed study related by an independent Trial Steering Committee (TSC).

 Conclusions: ERPonline offers a cheap accessible option for people seeking ongoing support following successful treatment.
However, given high functioning and low relapse rates in this study, testing clinical effectiveness for this population would require
very large sample sizes. Building in human support to use ERPonline should be considered.

Introduction
Bipolar Disorder
Bipolar disorder (BD) is a lifelong mental health condition
characterized by extreme fluctuating mood including recurrent
episodes of depression and mania, which generally starts in
adolescence and affects approximately 1-1.5% of adults
worldwide [1]. The impact of BD on employment and
relationships can be devastating, and the condition has high
financial costs, estimated at £5.2 billion annually in England
alone [2]. Preventing relapse is a key goal of most interventions
for BD. Interventions that teach people to recognize and respond
to early warning signs (EWS) are recommended by clinical
guidelines worldwide [3-5] but implementation in routine
clinical practice is poor [6]. Enhanced Relapse Prevention
(ERP), a structured manualized intervention for frontline care
staff, has shown significant benefit and is well received by
patients and staff [7]. However, delivered face-to-face it will
only ever be available to a small percentage of people with BD
due to low rates of psychological intervention provision even
among those who remain in secondary care services. In this
study, we test the feasibility and acceptability of a Web-based
version of ERP: ERPonline. Web-based interventions in mental
health offer the potential to broaden access, reduce waiting
times, delivery costs and stigma, and improve quality through
standardized delivery [8,9]. There is growing evidence for
short-term benefits of Internet-delivered psychological
treatments for depression and anxiety disorders compared with
waitlist (WL) controls [10], although understanding their
implementation into real-world services is still in its infancy
[11]. In BD, the evidence, while promising, is at an earlier stage,
comprising small-scale feasibility studies [12-18]. These studies,
along with results from an international multisite survey [19],
suggest that people with BD can use, and are interested in further
using, Web-based mental health support. However, detailed
evidence is lacking on what kinds of psychosocial support can
be Web-based, the best ways to deliver these, who accesses
Web-based interventions, what processes and outcomes are
impacted on, and how to best design rigorous trials to evaluate
them on the Web. This information is essential to inform
definitive clinical and cost-effectiveness trials. This study
addresses these issues in a novel randomized controlled trial
(RCT) to assess feasibility and acceptability of ERPonline with
all recruitment and assessments of outcome performed remotely.
Objectives
The objectives of this study were as follows:
First, to assess the feasibility of (1) creating a Web-based version
of enhanced relapse prevention for BD (ERPonline) and (2) an
RCT design using Web-based and telephone data collection to
evaluate effectiveness.
Second, to determine the acceptability of ERPonline for people
with BD via (1) ERPonline website usage, (2) number and type
of adverse events associated with site use, and (3) detailed
feedback from participants about their experiences of ERPonline
to inform future developments.
Third, to determine the feasibility and acceptability of data
collection via the Internet and telephone measured by
recruitment and retention rates, data completion, and direct
feedback from participants.
Fourth, to test the impact of the intervention on hypothesized
mechanisms of change to understand processes underlying any
impact.
Finally, to estimate the likely effect size of the intervention on
a range of outcomes, particularly noting any negative impacts.
Methods
Design
A single-blind RCT with nested qualitative study comparing
ERPonline plus usual treatment with a “waitlist control” arm
with delayed access to ERPonline plus usual treatment. Primary
outcomes were feasibility and acceptability. Process and clinical
outcomes were assessed to identify measures sensitive to change
collected remotely and to explore potential positive and negative
impacts of the intervention. Remote data collection and online
recruitment increased the external validity of the trial by
encouraging participation from those unable or unwilling to
engage in face-to-face clinical trials, who are also more likely
to be those people unable or unwilling to engage in face-to-face
clinical support for whatever reason. The study was not powered
to test statistically significant impact. The trial was preregistered
and full protocol published [16]. Ethics approval was given by
UK National Research Ethics Service (NRES) Committee North
West (Ref 12/NW/0594).
Participants
We aimed to recruit 125 participants, anticipating a dropout rate
of up to 35% (based on retention rates from previous trials of
Web-based interventions for BD [12-18]) providing 40 people
per arm, sufficient to meet the aims of our study to assess
feasibility and acceptability. Participants were aged ≥18 years,
residents of the United Kingdom, with a confirmed diagnosis

 of BD (1 or 2), at risk of relapse (≥3 previous episodes, ≥1 in
the preceding 2 years), and with access to the Internet. We
excluded people in current episode (within previous 4 weeks),
currently under Mental Health Act section and therefore likely
to be in current episode or at high risk of harm to self or others,
or unable to understand English sufficiently to engage with the
study.
Recruitment Strategy
The study was presented to clinical teams in 8 NHS Mental
Health Trusts in England, and staff were reminded in monthly
team meetings to direct service users to the Web-based
registration site. An advert was placed in a UK charity newsletter
(Bipolar UK), and on a charity website (Bipolar Scotland). A
link to ERPonline was put in NHS Choices, and British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) health online presented a short
article that linked to the website. The research team regularly
tweeted about the study, and our service user lead was
interviewed on local radio about the study.
People were invited to visit the site which explained the study,
allowed them to check eligibility, and to register an interest in
participating. Participants read online participant information
sheet and completed an online consent form. Consent and
capacity were reassessed at each assessment point.
Intervention
ERPonline was developed with extensive input from a reference
group of 8 adults with BD to adapt the original ERP manual to
a Web-based format. Input (online and face-to-face) occurred
throughout the study, but was more extensive during the initial
development of the ERPonline site and included feedback on
content of draft modules, user testing of the ERPonline website,
and providing video and case material of lived experience which
are integral parts of the intervention site. The aim of the
intervention is to help people develop a coherent working model
of their mood changes, recognize and manage triggers and EWS,
and develop coping strategies to manage these effectively. Key
modules are summarized in Table 1 with more detail in the
protocol paper [20].

Each module included information, suggested strategies, and

information relevant to their own triggers, EWS, and coping
strategies. These informed an individualized staying well plan.
The site also provided signposting to additional formal and
informal support. Participants were free to choose the order they
visited modules (although they were listed in logical order), and
were invited to involve a supporter of their choosing. Each
module included recommendations of how the supporter could
be involved in relapse prevention. All participants continued to

Procedure: Randomization and Masking
Diagnostic eligibility was confirmed using Structured Clinical
Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) [21] administered by telephone by
trained research assistants. Training consisted of scoring training
videos, conducting clinical sensitive interviews on the telephone,
and recording an interview with someone with BD who provided
experiential feedback and which was then rated by a supervising
clinical academic. Training continued until ratings were reliable
and clinical style was of high quality. Monthly supervision to
ensure reliability in scoring of telephone interviews continued
throughout the study. Following baseline assessments (telephone
and Web-based) participants were randomly allocated by an
independent clinical trials unit (CTU) using 1:1 ratio, minimized
on number of previous episodes (<8, 8-20, 21+) and including
a random element to minimize predictability of allocation. Those
in the ERPonline arm received an email containing a weblink
and instructions of how to log-on to the site using a unique
username and password. Control participants received an email
or telephone call informing them of the allocation and
emphasizing the importance of continued participation
throughout the trial. All communication with CTU and
participants regarding randomization was conducted by the trial
manager (unblinded). All communication with participants
reiterated the importance of not telling the researcher carrying
out the follow-up interviews which group they were in, and why
this was important. All assessments were conducted by blind
researchers. Blindness was further maintained using restricted
file access to any data showing randomization, and prefacing
each follow-up interview with a reminder about why it was
important not to say anything about which arm they were in.
During the trial, participants were sent an additional email
inviting them to provide qualitative feedback. The ERPonline
group was asked to complete a Web-based survey about their
views of the ERPonline site and any improvements they would
recommend. They were also given the option (between 2 and
12 months following randomization) to take part in a telephone
interview about their experiences of using ERPonline. Given
the relatively novel primarily Web-based trial design, the WL
control group was sent a survey before accessing the site about
their reasons for engaging in the trial, and their experience of
taking part in the trial.
A reflective log detailed our experiences throughout the trial.
Measures
Proposed mechanisms of change, were assessed at baseline, 24
and 48 weeks including frequency of EWS monitoring (EWS
checklist for relapse in depression and mania [22] Likert scale
1=never to 4=very regularly), adapted Brief Illness Perception
Questionnaire (BIPQ score 0-110: higher score=more negative
beliefs) [23], and the Medication Adherence Rating Scale
(MARS 0-10: higher score=higher compliance) [24]. These

 measures were either designed for use with people with BD
(EWS checklists and BIPQ), or have been successfully used
with this population (MARS). They are all self-report, have
high face validity, and have been shown to be valid and reliable
measures, making them highly applicable to Web-based use.
Interviewer-rated outcome measures were administered by
telephone by two trained research assistants, at baseline, 12-,
24-, 36-, and 48-week follow-up. These included SCID-LIFE
[25] providing a retrospective weekly rating of depression (1-6)
and mania (1-6) (scores of 5 or 6 indicate major mood episode);
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D scores above 7
indicate mild depression, above 13 moderate, and above 18
severe) [26], and Mania Rating Scale (MRS scores of 11 and
above indicate hypomania) [27]; the Personal and Social
Performance Scale (PSP scores 70-80 indicate mild difficulties,
above 80 is good functioning) [28]; and the Multidimensional
Scale of Independent Functioning (MSIF Likert scale 1=normal
functioning, to 7=total disability) [29]. Self-report outcome
measures were collected at baseline, 24, and 48 weeks and
included the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS less
than 10=subclinical; 10-20 some functional impairment; above
20 moderate psychopathology) [30]; Quality of Life in Bipolar
Disorder (QoLBD range 48-240 with high score=higher quality
of life) [31]; and the Bipolar Recovery Questionnaire (BRQ
score 0-3600, high score=higher recovery) [32]. Web-based
versions of the EQ5D5L [33] and the Client Service Receipt
Inventory (CSRI) [34] were piloted to assess the feasibility of
collecting this data on the Web and to test the sensitivity to
change in this population as neither have been previously used
in this format. A checklist to record current treatment was
developed for the study to define usual treatment.
The only change to the published protocol was to record only
the frequency of monitoring of EWS for hypomania and
depression, as early feedback from participants indicated the
full checklist was too long. All serious adverse events (SAEs)
were recorded and reported to the Trial Steering Committee
(TSC). All participants were given a £10 shopping voucher on
completion of measures at each assessment point.
Analysis
Descriptive statistics report the characteristics of the sample
recruited; use of the website; and rates of recruitment, retention,
and data completion in each arm of the trial. The impact on
repeated process and outcome measures was tested using linear
models with correlated errors, which allow for correlation
between repeated measures from the same participant. For
ordinal data, we used generalized linear mixed models. We
report both unadjusted analyses, and those adjusting for any
differences in baseline demographic (age, gender, ethnicity,
employment, education) and clinical variables (number of
previous episodes, and whether or not prescribed a mood
stabilizer).
Incomplete records from participants were retained, and analyses
used maximum likelihood estimation for all model parameters.
Statistical comparison of outcomes was made between the two
trial arms at 24 and 48 weeks follow-up.
Weekly ratings of depression and mania from the SCID-LIFE
were used to analyze time to first relapse (any and separately
for depression [requiring 2 consecutive weeks], or mania [1
week]) and the proportion of time spent in episode (defined as
SCID-LIFE rating of 5 or 6), or in subsyndromal state
(SCID-LIFE rating of 3 or 4) or euthymic (SCID-LIFE rating
of 1 or 2). To analyze the impact of the intervention on time to
first relapse, we used a Cox’s proportional hazards regression
model. Beta regression was used to compare the proportion of
time spent in episode or subsyndromal or euthymic in each arm.
The study is not powered to test for statistically significant
impact and therefore we do not specify a primary outcome, or
set a level of statistical significance for interpreting analyses.
All analyses were run from R open-source computing
environment version 3.3.1 (R Foundation for Statistical
Computing).
Content analysis of qualitative survey data highlighted the
individual points made and these were grouped into key themes.
Interview transcripts were analyzed in depth using indexing and
charting methods inspired by Framework Analysis [35]. All
transcripts were independently coded by the interviewer (MG)
and a second member of the research team. Codes were
compiled into a tentative coding frame with thematic headings.
Narrative summaries were created from each of the conceptual
themes across all cases. This data will be reported in full
elsewhere but here we present key data relevant to the feasibility
and acceptability aims of the trial.
Results
Quality Assurance
Only two unblindings occurred. In both instances, the participant
inadvertently indicated their group during a telephone
assessment (one WL control, one ERPonline). Subsequent
assessments were completed by a blind Research assistant. At
each follow-up, 10% of the SCID-LIFE interviews were rated
by both researchers and kappa statistic calculated to assess
interrater reliability. These ranged from acceptable (κ=.54, 95%
CI 0.39-0.69, at 36 weeks based on 142 weekly ratings for 6
participants) to high (κ=.90, 95% CI 0.82-0.98, at 12 weeks
based on 192 weekly ratings for 8 people).
Feasibility and Acceptability of Trial Design
Participant flow is detailed in Figure 3, including recruitment,
over half of which came via online sources. A total of 96 people
were randomized (49 to WL, 47 to ERPonline) over a 17-month
period, with 80% retention in telephone and online follow-up
at all time points, except week 48 (76%). Attrition was 11%
lower in WL arm.
Participants were predominantly diagnosed with BD1 (90%)
and had a chronic relapsing course (67% had over 21 relapses;
see Table 2). Despite this, the group was currently high
functioning and had a positive attitude to recovery. The vast
majority were taking and adherent to medication to manage
their mood and over half had previously received psychological
treatment for BD (where specified, this was most commonly
described as cognitive behavior therapy [CBT]).

 Figure 3. The online enhanced relapse prevention intervention (ERPonline) consort diagram.
Feasibility and Acceptability of Data Collection
Telephone and Web-based data collection procedures were
generally acceptable to participants based on information from
41 participants (WL survey, n=22; ERPonline interviews, n=19
reported separately). Survey data indicated factors that
encouraged people to take part including opportunity to improve
their own resilience and self-management, wanting to help
others, and recognizing the importance of research on improving
Web-based interventions, due to a perceived gap in face-to-face

 services and some existing websites feeling unsafe. Many of
these factors were also cited as facilitating retention in the trial,
as well as factors such as text reminders about follow-ups, and
viewing the research team as sensitive, polite, and nonintrusive.
Participants reported that the research process was
well-managed, clearly explained, straightforward, and flexible,
and they liked the shopping vouchers. Some participants
believed completing the measures had changed their thinking
about their mood and diagnosis. Barriers to retention included
procedural difficulties, such as remembering follow-up times
and rescheduling missed appointments, feeling “weird” to have
interviews only on the phone and difficulties finding private
space for the phone calls; issues with measures, some of which
were too long (CSRI) and could be tiring, distressing, and
required recall over long periods of time; and technical
difficulties with Web-based questionnaires. Some reported
feeling disappointed to be in the WL control arm, although had
remained in the trial.
Additional key data collection lessons we learnt included the
importance of checking electronic communication is received
(some of our reminder emails were initially going into junk
folders), the need to accommodate the high demand for evening
and weekend telephone appointments, and the importance of
text reminders for telephone appointments.
Feasibility and Acceptability of ERPonline Intervention
ERPonline is low cost at an estimated £19,340 to create, and
approximately £2176 per year to host and maintain the site.
Development costs included time to adapt content from the ERP
manual; discussion and feedback with coauthors; Web developer
time to build the site; filming and producing videos; and costs
for the Service User Reference Group to feedback on early
iterations. Hosting costs include software updates and technical
issues (estimated at 2 h per week) and space on a server. To
keep costs low, ERPonline was delivered unsupported and
without a Web-based moderated forum, despite these being part
of the intended design.
Activity levels were highly skewed. Two people allocated to
ERPonline never visited the site. Mean number of page views
per person was 259 (SD 577), median was 85 (range 0-3203).
Participants spent a mean of 259 min (SD 509), median 76 min
(range 0-2770) accessing ERPonline throughout the 48-week
intervention period. The most frequently viewed modules were
“Life Charting” (median views 11; range 0-990 per person) and
“Mood Charting” (median views 13; range 1-2519 per person),
which is unsurprising as they offered an ongoing monitoring
function. “Coping strategies for Low Mood” (median views 0:
range 0-44 per person) and “Your Staying Well Plan” (median
views 0; range 0-30 per person) were the least frequently visited,
but also occurred toward the end of the listed modules (see
Table 1 for number of visits and time spent on all modules).
A total of 17 ERPonline participants (36%) responded to the
Web-based survey. Overall these participants were satisfied
(13/17 people [76%] somewhat or very satisfied), found it
somewhat or very helpful (12/17, 71%), and very or extremely
relevant (13/17, 76%). Only one person said they would not
recommend it to a friend. Most useful features were recognizing
EWS of relapse, shared experiences through videos, mood
monitoring, ability to revisit and refresh skills, improved
knowledge and self-management of BD, ease of use, and being
able to use the site with the family. The key recommendation
for improvement was additional support with working through
the materials. The sample of questionnaire respondents described
themselves as confident (n=16, 94% very or extremely
confident) and regular (n=12, 71% at least daily) Internet users.
A total of 19 people took part in qualitative interviews about
their experience of the trial and use of the ERPonline site. The
key finding was the importance of relationships that the
individual developed with the ERPonline team in determining
retention into the study and use of the site:
I think the sort of general thoroughness and kindness
of the people I dealt with that certainly contributed
to, you know, me sort of staying in the study.
Everybody’s been really upbeat, very positive, very
accommodating [P10]
This is particularly interesting when we consider there was no
face-to-face contact. Sole direct contact was by telephone at
three monthly interviews for SCID-LIFE interviews, which for
some was preferable to face-to-face:
…I think it being over the ‘phone makes it a bit easier.
If it’s face-to-face I would have probably not been
quite so comfortable answering. But yeah over the
‘phone was definitely not so bad. [P13]
Crucial to the strength of the alliance was the perceived
trustworthiness of the team and being made aware of the
extensive user involvement in design and content of the site:
It’s always available and also the information’s on
there has been put together by the people who do
know what they’re doing. [P7]
I suppose the prospect of the online study kept me
quite interested and the fact that it was developed by
other people with Bipolar and that was something
that I was definitely interested in… [P17]
A key recommendation to improve the ERPonline site was to
integrate human support to facilitate ongoing use of the site.
This is consistent with previous studies in which adherence was
higher in groups receiving a Web intervention plus support as
compared with Web intervention only [31]. Participants felt
websites should be used to support interventions delivered by
real people and not as a cheaper replacement:
The cash strapped health service will rely heavily on
these sort of techniques which I think only fill one
part of the market. I think they only really deal with,
you know, and a comparatively narrow field of
potential patients. I think they’re very useful but I do
think the gold standard involves some sort of
face-to-face psychological therapy. And I think the
clinical literature bears that out so, I want more jobs
for psychologists basically [Henry: 23.893-23.898]

Estimate of Impact on Outcome and Process Measures
Descriptive statistics on process and outcome measures at each
time point are shown in Table 3. Comparison between WL and
ERPonline on process and outcome measures at 12-, 24-, and
48-week follow-ups are shown in Table 4. Models adjusting for
baseline demographic and clinical variables are also shown in
Table 5.
Process Measures
ERPonline increased the frequency of monitoring early signs
of mood change (EWS—depression and EWS—hypomania),
evident for hypomania at 24 weeks (−1.72, 95% CI −2.98 to
−0.47), and for both at 48 weeks (depression −1.39, 95% CI
−2.61 to −0.163; hypomania −1.61, 95% CI −2.92 to −0.30),
and improved working model of mood changes (BIPQ—high
score indicates more negative model) at both 24 weeks (10.70,
95% CI 0.90-20.5) and 48 weeks follow-ups (13.18, 95% CI
2.44-23.93; Table 4). All differences are robust to adjustments
in model 2 for baseline differences between the groups (Table
5). Medication adherence was high (indicated by high score on
the MARS) throughout the study and did not differ between
groups.
Mood and Functioning
Depression and hypomania were low at all time points
suggesting a generally stable and euthymic group. Similarly,
functioning on WSAS, PSP, and MSIF at baselines were
suggestive of very mild impairment in work and social
performance and remained so throughout. Time spent in
euthymic, subsyndromal, and relapse mood states respectively
in WL were 93% (SD 8%), 5% (SD 7%), and 3% (SD 15%),
and in ERPonline: 95% (SD 8%), 4% (SD 6%), and 2% (SD
4%). There were no notable differences between the two groups
in any of the outcome measures at any of the time-points.
Relapse
Of the 96 participants, one provided no SCID-LIFE data at
follow-up. Only 15 (16%) participants experienced a relapse
over the 48-week follow-up; 11 (11%) depressive and 7 (7%)
mania-type. There were no notable differences between groups

 in the WL arm, and 5 were receiving ERPonline. None of the

Discussion
Principal Findings
ERPonline is a novel Web intervention for improving relapse
prevention and providing National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) congruent information to people with BD.
This study indicates that the development and evaluation of this
type of approach in a rigorous RCT using telephone and
Web-based assessments is both feasible and acceptable.
Important lessons were learnt relevant to each of our study aims,
but which also have relevance to the wider development and
evaluation of remote-access approaches for other health
problems.
With the help of our Service User Reference Group, we were
able to develop a Web-based version of an existing ERP
intervention for people with BD at a very low cost that received
largely positive feedback, and led to no evident adverse events.
Activity was highly skewed but over 90% of our sample visited
the site more than once, which can be compared with
MyRecoveryPlan [17] that reported site returns for 71% in a
coached group, and only 44% in an unsupported group. On the
basis of levels of use of the different modules and direct
participant feedback, engagement could be enhanced by making
the intervention more interactive and providing support to use
it.
Recruitment, retention, and data completion strategies were
largely successful. Retention was higher than demonstrated in
previous Web-based trials with people who are affected with
BD [14,15,17]. Key features of the trial design that facilitated
this included payment for completing assessments, text and
email reminders, a WL control design, and a friendly flexible
research team who were willing to offer telephone appointments
at times to suit participants including out-of-office hours.
However, to reach the sample size required for large scale
clinical and cost effectiveness trials, paying for advertising
through popular websites such as Google and Facebook may
be necessary [36].
Feedback about the experience of taking part in a primarily
Web-based trial was mixed. Some participants reported
difficulties finding a private space to take telephone calls or
finding Web-based measures difficult, tiring or distressing,
whereas others valued the flexibility, convenience, and felt more
able to be open about the problems they had experienced than
in a face-to-face interview. This suggests that trials which offer
a choice of data collection options may be most effective in
achieving recruitment and retention targets.
However, further work is needed to test the validity and
reliability of these data collection approaches. Our data showed
that while the hypothesized increase in EWS monitoring and
development of more positive beliefs about mood swings did
occur in those receiving ERPonline compared with WL control
group, we did not see any benefit of ERPonline on any of the
clinical outcome measures. This was largely due to the ceiling
effect on our outcome measures. Only 16% of the total sample
experienced any relapse, compared with expected levels of
50-70% [37].
This ceiling effect was consistent across all outcome measures
and all assessors. Therefore, the most likely explanations are
either that the method of data collection is leading to
underreporting of problems, or that the participating sample
reflect a different population from those taking part in more
traditionally designed face-to-face clinical studies.
With regards to the first possibility, whereas we did not directly
test the reliability of the data compared with a face-to-face
interview, other studies have done this comparing telephone
and face-to-face interview data of SCID assessments found high
levels of agreement [38]. Our team have also carried out a
parallel Web-based RCT which included the same Web-based
and telephone assessments, delivered through researchers trained
by the same methods, and which will report relapse rates of
47% which are akin to those expected from previous research
data and much higher than in this study [39].
The second possible explanation can be explored by examining
the characteristics of our participants. Compared with bipolar
samples recruited to other face-to-face trials [37] including one
evaluating clinician delivered ERP [7], and samples in other
Web-based trials which all show higher relapse rates [14,15,17],
our sample are more euthymic, highly educated, likely to be in
employment, and have had surprisingly high levels of access
to previous psychological therapy. Further work is needed to
better understand how using a primarily Web-based trial design
may impact on sample characteristics, and the information they
provide.
The Future for ERPonline
ERPonline offers a cheap and easily accessible option for people
who are seeking ongoing support following successful treatment,
which is currently unavailable. However, given the high
functioning and low relapse rates evident in this study, testing
the clinical effectiveness of ERPonline for this population would
require very large sample sizes. Alternatively, ERPonline could
target people at an earlier stage of treatment, who have had not
yet received more expensive face-to-face psychological therapy,
and need support to understand their mood swings, consider the
pros and cons of medication use, and explore the usefulness of
monitoring and managing EWS of relapse. For this group,
ERPonline may offer a way to reduce the need for expensive
individual therapy. Consistent with participant recommendations
and previous research, we also need to consider how best to
integrate support mechanisms to facilitate use of the
intervention, either by integrating the Web-based resource with
clinician delivered relapse prevention, or through online peer
support as described in other Web-based interventions for BD
[10,11,13]. This study highlights the importance of the
relationship that the users have with Web-based interventions
and how this develops as an extension of the relationship with
the humans perceived as offering and supporting its use.
Web-based interventions offered in isolation in this context
seem unlikely to engage people in the same way and may be
perceived negatively as attempts to save money rather than
improve care. Our study has explored the feasibility and
acceptability of a specific Web-based intervention (ERPonline),

 but does not address the broader social issue of how acceptable
the increasing use of digital health technology is to people with
mental health problems [40].
Strengths of Study
Extensive user involvement improved the content of the
ERPonline website, identified recruitment sources, and ensured
the measures were appropriate and not too burdensome. The
sample was sufficiently large to be able to comment on patterns
in the data likely to be indicative of effects on process and
outcome measures in a larger trial. Independent randomization,
trained blind assessors, and the use of well-established outcome
and process measures ensured that the data are reliable and
valid. Extensive reflection and learning around feasibility was
built into the design process using face-to-face meetings and
an online reflection log.
Limitations
Despite 280 unique site registrations, only 145 people consented,
and due to ineligibility and drop out, only 96 were randomized.
We have no data on why nearly half the sample registering an
interest, then chose not to take part, though for some it may
have been delay between prestart expression of interest and
randomization. During the trial, we had higher dropout in the
ERPonline arm, which is common in trials with a WL control
arm and is likely due to the perceived reward of the intervention
retaining people through WL. Survey responses were incomplete
for feedback on trial participation (22/49 in WL group, 45%)
and for feedback on the ERPonline intervention (17/47 in
ERPonline arm, 36%). The bias in responders is likely to skew
the nature of the feedback which on the whole was very positive.
In summary, we were able to successfully adapt and deliver
online a relapse prevention intervention for BD previously used
face-to-face. The intervention was successfully evaluated against
a WL control group using a RCT design with high levels of
retention and data completeness over 48 weeks. Participants
had high rates of previous bipolar episodes but had accessed
previous psychosocial interventions (where specified, most
commonly described as CBT) for BD. Web-based interventions
may prove an important cheap, feasible, and acceptable step
forward in creating a choice of evidence-based interventions
for people with BD at different stages of recovery, but may be
more appropriately designed with built-in support and targeted
at those with less prior experience of effective care.
