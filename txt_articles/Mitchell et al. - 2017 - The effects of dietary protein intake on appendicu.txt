ABSTRACT
Background: The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for protein
intake in the adult population is widely promoted as 0.8 g $ kg21 $ d21.
Aging may increase protein requirements, particularly to maintain
muscle mass.
Objective: We investigated whether controlled protein consumption
at the current RDA or twice the RDA (2RDA) affects skeletal mus-
cle mass and physical function in elderly men.
Design: In this parallel-group randomized trial, 29 men aged .70 y
[mean 6 SD body mass index (in kg/m2): 28.3 6 4.2] were pro-
vided with a complete diet containing either 0.8 (RDA) or 1.6 (2RDA)
g protein $ kg21 $ d21, aimed to balance energy needs. Before treat-
ment and after 10 wk of intervention, whole-body and appendicular
lean mass were measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.
Knee-extension peak power was measured with dynamometry.
Results: Both groups were found to have been in a moderate negative
energy balance (mean 6 SD RDA: 209 6 213 kcal/d; 2RDA 145 6
214 kcal/d; P = 0.427 for difference between the groups). In comparison
with RDA, whole-body lean mass increased in 2RDA (P = 0.001; 1.49 6
1.30 kg, P , 0.001 compared with 20.55 6 1.49 kg, P = 0.149). This
difference was mostly accounted for by an increase in trunk lean mass
found in 2RDA (+1.39 6 1.09 kg, P , 0.001). Appendicular lean
mass also decreased in RDA compared with 2RDA (P = 0.022), driven
by a reduction in RDA (20.64 6 0.91 kg, P = 0.005 compared with
0.11 6 0.57 kg, P = 0.592). Adjusting for energy imbalances did not
alter these findings. Knee-extension peak power was also differently
affected (P = 0.012; 26.6 6 47.7 W, P = 0.015 in 2RDA compared
with 211.7 6 31.0 W, P = 0.180 in RDA).
Conclusions: Consumption of a diet providing 2RDA for protein com-
pared with the current guidelines was found to have beneficial effects on
lean body mass and leg power in elderly men. These effects were not
explained by differences in energy balance. This trial was registered at
the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (www.anzctr.org.au)
as ACTRN12616000310460.

INTRODUCTION
Skeletal muscle is required for locomotion and the perfor-
mance of activities of daily living (1). Declines in skeletal muscle
mass can increase the risk of metabolic disease (2) and mortality
associated with serious illness (3) as well as the risk of frailty (4).
Muscle mass and physical function begin to decline around the
fifth decade of life, and the losses accelerate with advancing age
(5). Severe muscle loss and impaired functionality lead to the
onset of sarcopenia, a condition associated with frailty, loss of
independence, and a greater mortality risk (6).
Central to the maintenance of adequate muscle mass is ha-
bitual dietary protein intake (7). Consuming the highest quintile
(1.2 g $ kg21 $ d21) of dietary protein has been shown to be
associated with a smaller muscle loss in older adults (8). This is
incongruous with health agencies, including the WHO (9) and
the USDA (10), which have established the Recommended
Daily Allowance (RDA) of 0.8 g protein $ kg21 $ d21. This
value was set to achieve a positive or neutral nitrogen balance
for 97.5% of the adult population but does not take into account
any other metric of health status (11).
These recommendations have been generalized to older adults
despite some nitrogen balance studies suggesting a higher protein
requirement in older adults (11, 12). Recent reevaluations of the
protein requirements with the use of the indicator amino acid
oxidation technique suggest that nitrogen balance methodology
may underestimate protein needs by as much as 30% (13, 14).
There is also evidence of anabolic resistance in the elderly,
whereby skeletal muscle synthesis in response to ingested protein
is suppressed at any given ingested dose, relative to younger
individuals (15–17). With this uncertainty, protein intakes of up

 to twice the current RDA (2RDA) have been recommended as
optimal for older adults at risk of sarcopenia (18).
There are limited data from randomized controlled trials on the
impact of different protein intakes on skeletal muscle mass and
function in the elderly. To date, clinical interventions have ana-
lyzed the actions of protein supplements rather than changes in
habitual diet to modify protein intakes (19). Although supplements
may be beneficial in certain situations, dietary guidelines and
common practice are based on the consumption of whole foods
rather than isolated macronutrients (20). Therefore, the aim of the
present study was to determine whether the consumption of a
well-controlled diet containing either RDA (0.8 g $ kg21 $ d21)
or 2RDA (1.6 g $ kg21 $ d21) of protein for 10 wk would
affect lean mass and muscle strength in healthy men aged
.70 y differently. Although muscle mass is a major de-
terminant of physical function in the elderly (21), it has been
demonstrated that muscle strength declines at a rate greater
than the loss of muscle mass (22). Hence, measures of phys-
ical function including muscle power (23) are important for
the assessment of the efficacy of dietary intervention. There-
fore, the secondary aim of this study was to determine whether
the amount of protein intake altered measures of physical
function.
METHODS
Subjects
Thirty-one healthy men aged .70 y were recruited to take
part in the study (Table 1) by using advertisements placed in
local newspapers. Participants were nonsmokers who had BMIs
(in kg/m2) ranging from 18 to 35 and did not take any dietary
supplements for $1 mo preceding the trial. All participants were
able to perform activities of daily living independently without
mobility aids. The exclusion criteria included a prior history
of cancers, diabetes, thyroid diseases, or conditions affecting neu-
romuscular function, and participants who completed .4 h/wk of
structured physical activity (organized sport, resistance train-
ing, or vigorous intensity aerobic exercise). Similarly, those
with restricted eating habits, including vegetarians and those
with allergies (e.g., nuts, fish, dairy), were not included in the
study.
The study was approved by the Southern Health and Disability
Ethics Committee (New Zealand; 15/STH/236) and was con-
ducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed
written consent was obtained from all participants before they
were enrolled in the trial. The study was prospectively registered
with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry
(www.anzctr.org.au) as ACTRN12616000310460.
Experimental design
The trial used a parallel-group design with individual par-
ticipant random assignment conducted by using sequences
generated by www.random.org. Allocation (1:1 ratio) was
conducted by using a locked spreadsheet that assigned partic-
ipants to treatment groups. Investigators were involved in both
diet preparation and participant testing, so they were not blinded
to group allocation. Group allocation was not discussed with
participants; however, it was likely clear to them, based on the
food they were provided, the group to which they were assigned.
A priori primary outcomes were defined as changes in lean body
mass and isometric knee-extension strength. Before com-
mencement of the intervention participants were given a tool to
estimate portion size using their hand size as a guide (25) and
recorded their dietary intake for 3 consecutive days and col-
lected their full urine output over a 24-h period. Participants also

 wore an accelerometer on their wrist for 5 d to estimate their
level of physical activity. Physical function, body composition,
thigh muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), and muscle strength
were measured as described below. Analyses and tests were then
repeated after a 10-wk period of dietary control. All testing was
conducted at the University of Auckland Nutrition and Mobility
Clinic between April and October 2016. After pre-intervention
testing participants were provided with a controlled diet that
contained either 0.8 (RDA) or 1.6 g protein $ kg21 $ d21
(2RDA) for 10 wk. During the intervention participants were
instructed to maintain their normal lifestyle, and prepared
meals were delivered to their homes.
Dietary control
All food consumed by the participants during the 10-wk trial
was provided by investigators, with the exception of black
coffee and tea. Lunch and dinner were provided in prepared
form requiring only reheating by participants. Some breakfast
meals required minimal preparation by the participants. Por-
tioned snacks were also provided and included fresh fruit, dried
fruit, and nuts.
All participants consumed 28–31% of energy from fat; those
randomly assigned to the RDA group consumed 0.8 g protein $
kg21 $ d21, and those randomly assigned to 2RDA group con-
sumed 1.6 g protein $ kg21 $ d21. The difference was made up
of carbohydrates. Both diets met local recommendations for the
intake of fruits and vegetables (26). All diets were omnivorous
and adhered to Eating and Activity Guidelines for New Zealand
Adults (27). Protein and energy were distributed between
breakfast, lunch, and dinner as 30%, 30%, and 40%, re-
spectively. Compliance records were completed to ensure that
all provided food was consumed, and food selection was ad-
justed based on participants’ preferences to maintain high
compliance. Records completed by participants during weeks 5,
6, 9, and 10 of the study were compared with the diets provided
to calculate the proportion of total energy and protein provided
that was consumed by participants. The compliance records
consisted of a menu checklist where participants indicated the
percentage of each menu item they consumed. Participants were
asked to record any nonstudy food they consumed.
Habitual diets (based on 3-d diet records) and diets consumed
during the trial were analyzed by using Foodworks software
(Version 8; Xyris) by a dietetics graduate student. The energy
content of the intervention diets was individually calculated to
match subjects’ estimated energy needs based on the Harris-
Benedict equation and adjusted for physical activity level (28,
29) assessed by wrist-worn accelerometers (Fitbit Charge HR);
these devices have been shown to perform similarly to validated
devices for the energy expenditure range of the study partici-
pants (30). Estimated energy needs were calculated before the
commencement of the invention diet and were adjusted fort-
nightly based on participant satiety to ensure participants con-
sumed adequate energy relative to protein intake. Accelerometers
were worn for 5-d periods before the start of the intervention and
at weeks 5 and 10. The net energy balance was calculated by
using the chemical energy equivalents for changes in fat mass
(9434 kcal/kg) and fat-free mass (1815 kcal/kg); it was as-
sumed that changes in body energy stores reflect energy bal-
ance over the 10-wk intervention (31).
Imaging and physical function
Body weight was measured without shoes in light clothing
on a digital scale (Tanita DH-351) after participants voided their
bladder, and height was measured on a stadiometer without
shoes. Full-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
scans (Lunar Prodigy; GE) were segmented into trunk and limbs
automatically by the software; this segmentation was verified
and adjusted as necessary by a single investigator (SMM).
Participants wore light clothing without metal fasteners and
were positioned with their arms by their sides and separated
from their trunk. All participants were fully contained within the
DXA field of view. Thigh muscle CSA at 50% femur length of
the dominate leg was assessed by using a Stratec XCT 3000
peripheral quantitative computed tomography with software
version 6.20C (Stratec Medizintechnik). Participants were
positioned supine with the test leg centered within the ma-
chine’s gantry and anchored by a foot rest with straps to limit
movement during each scan. Images were then exported to
ImageJ (NIH), and the muscle area was manually determined
by a single investigator (SMM). At least 3 d before the ex-
perimental strength, power, and physical function measure-
ments, participants completed the identical measurements to
familiarize them with the testing apparatus and procedures.
Isometric muscle strength of the knee extensors was tested by
using a Biodex System 4 dynamometer with the knee angle set
to 908 of flexion. Three maximal contractions were performed
for each movement with 30 s of rest in between and the highest
values were used for analysis. Participants then performed a
test to determine the maximal power output of their knee ex-
tensors using the same Biodex positioning. Three isotonic
repetitions were performed each with 30%, 40%, and 50% of
the participant’s maximal isometric strength. Participants were
instructed to perform each repetition at maximal speed, power
was calculated as the product of torque and velocity, and the
maximal power recorded across all trials was taken as the
participant’s peak power (32). Isometric grip strength was
measured by using a Jamar dynamometer (Patterson Medical)
with the grip set to position 2; 3 trials were preformed with
each hand, and the highest values recorded for each hand were
then averaged. Physical function was measured by using the
short physical performance battery (SPPB) (33) and timed
up-and-go test (TUG) (34).
Urine analysis
On the day of urine collection participants did not collect their
first morning urination but collected all subsequent urine pro-
duced that day including the first morning urination the following
day. Samples were weighed before a 10-mL aliquot was stored at
2208C for further analysis. Urine urea, creatinine, and uric acid
were measured with a Cobas c311 analyzer (Roche Di-
agnostics). Total protein intake was estimated based on urinary
nitrogen excretion and corrected for nonurinary losses with a
standard factor of 4 g (35).
Statistical analysis
The sample size of 15 participants/group was calculated
based on detecting a between-group difference of 800 g whole
body lean mass using the test-retest variability of 765 g

 previously observed in our laboratory as the SD, a power of
80%, and an alpha of 5%. Changes in dietary intake and body
mass were assessed by 2-factor ANOVA with time (before
compared with after) as a repeated factor and diet (RDA
compared with 2RDA) as a between subject factor. Two-factor
ANCOVA with energy deficit as a covariate, time (before
compared with after) as a repeated factor, and diet (RDA
compared with 2RDA) as a between-subject factor was used to
assess changes in body composition and physical function.
Normality was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test, and non-
normally distributed data were log transformed before further
analysis. Student’s t test was used to compare the degree of
energy deficit or surplus between groups. Post hoc comparisons
were conducted by using Sidak corrections. All analysis was
conducted by using SPSS (IBM) version 23. Alpha was set at
P # 0.05. Unadjusted means 6 SDs are shown in the tables
and text.
RESULTS
Thirty-one subjects were randomly assigned to the 2 dietary
interventions (Figure 1); of these, 1 subject (assigned to the
RDA group) withdrew his consent before the start of the dietary
intervention, and 1 participant was removed from the study at
week 5 of the intervention because of lack of compliance with
the diet (2RDA). Subsequent analysis was performed only on
those participants who completed the study per protocol.
Compliance was 98.9% for both protein and energy intake in the
RDA group. Compliance was 97.5% and 98.4% for protein and
energy intakes, respectively, in the 2RDA group. Compliance
was not different between groups. No adverse events related to
the diets were reported during the study.
Dietary intake
Dietary intake assessed before (habitual) and during the in-
tervention (controlled) is shown in Table 2. According to this the
RDA group decreased their energy intake by 14% from their
self-reported habitual intake, and the 2RDA group increased
their energy intake by 25% from their self-reported habitual
intake. However, based on changes in body composition, both
groups were in slight energy deficit of 209 6 213 and 145 6
214 kcal/d in the RDA and 2RDA groups, respectively. There was
no difference in energy deficit between groups (P = 0.427). Total
protein and animal-source protein intake was decreased in the
RDA group and increased in the 2RDA group relative to habitual
intake. When protein intake was estimated by using urinary
nitrogen excretion, the same pattern was observed. As a con-
sequence of dietary control, the RDA group decreased the per-
centage of energy intake from fat and increased the percentage
of energy intake from carbohydrates, whereas the percentage of
energy from carbohydrates and fat was statistically unchanged in
the 2RDA group. The number of steps taken per day before
the start of the intervention was 7879 6 3106 and 8740 6 2699
in RDA and 2RDA groups, respectively (P = 0.641) and did not
change during the intervention (P = 0.593).

 Body composition
After correction for energy deficit there was no difference
in the magnitude of total-body mass change between groups
(P = 0.174; Table 3). Total fat mass was decreased similarly in
both groups by 1.5 6 1.5 and 1.4 6 1.6 kg in the RDA and 2RDA
groups, respectively, but after correction for energy deficit the
decrease was greater in the 2RDA group (P = 0.001). The per-
centage of body fat decreased by 1.0% 6 1.0% and 1.6% 6 1.5%
in the RDA and 2RDA groups, respectively, but after correction
for energy deficit the decrease was greater in the 2RDA group
(P = 0.004).
Whole-body lean mass increased in the 2RDA group compared
with the RDA group (P = 0.001). Whole-body lean mass was
unchanged in the RDA group (20.55 6 1.49 kg, P = 0.149) but
increased (1.49 6 1.30 kg, P , 0.001) in the 2RDA group
(Figure 2A). The increase in lean mass in the 2RDA group was
mainly accounted for by an increase in lean mass of the trunk
(Figure 2B). Appendicular lean mass was decreased in the RDA
group (P = 0.003) but unchanged in the 2RDA group (P = 0.403;
Figure 2C). Composition of each individual limb is shown in
Supplemental Table 1. Thigh muscle CSA corrected for energy
deficit did not change over the course of the study (2539 6 786
and 2120 6 292 mm2) in the RDA and 2RDA groups, re-
spectively (P = 0.112; Table 3).
Physical function and strength
Isometric knee-extension maximal strength did not change
after correction for energy deficit (28.6 6 24.2 and 7.5 6 22.9 Nm)

 in the RDA and 2RDA groups, respectively (Table 4). The SPPB
score and TUG time were not normally distributed, so they were
log normalized before statistical analysis and were not altered
by either dietary intervention. Grip strength was unaltered by
either intervention (Table 4). There was one apparent outlier in
the grip-strength measurements of the 2RDA group who de-
creased his grip strength by 25 kg, which is .3 SDs from the
group mean; if this participant is removed a between-group
difference in grip strength is observed (Figure 3, P = 0.003).
Peak knee-extension power was not normally distributed and
was therefore log transformed before statistical analysis. It was
increased in the 2RDA group compared with the RDA group
(P = 0.012). Peak knee-extension power was unaltered in the
RDA group 211.7 6 31.0 W (P = 0.180) but increased in the
2RDA group 26.6 6 47.7 W (P = 0.015).
DISCUSSION
Dietary protein intake is an important regulator of skeletal
muscle mass in the elderly (8, 36, 37). The current study ex-
amined the effects of a controlled diet in free-living elderly men
designed to provide either the RDA for protein (0.8 g $ kg21 $
d21) or 2RDA (1.6 g protein $ kg21 $ d21) on body composition
and strength. In free-living men aged .70 y, 10 wk of a con-
trolled diet meeting the current RDA for protein but imposing
an w200-kcal/d energy deficit and reduction in protein intake
from their habitual intake caused a loss of appendicular lean
mass of w600 g. Protein consumption of 2RDA did not alter
appendicular lean mass but increased both knee-extension peak
power output and whole-body lean mass. Thus, in this ran-
domized controlled trial the current dietary recommendation for
protein was insufficient to maintain muscle mass and physical
function in older men.
Participants in this study habitually consumed on average more
protein (w1.1–1.2 g $ kg21 $ d21) than the population
representative a national dietary survey (w1.0 g $ kg21 $ d21)
of elderly New Zealand males (aged .70 y) (38). The men were
omnivorous, with an animal-to-plant protein ratio of w1.5.
However, in the present study 26% of men reported habitually
consuming less protein than the RDA, whereas 14% of the men
reported consuming a habitual diet that was equal to or greater
than 2RDA with similar distribution between groups. It cannot
be ruled out that, because 12 of 15 men in the RDA group de-
creased their protein intake, the observed reduction in lean mass
could at least partly have occurred in the early phase of the
intervention before habituation to a reduction in protein intake
(39). The men were able to adhere to the controlled diet with
.97% of energy and protein provided being consumed. Intake
records and urinary nitrogen excretion analysis both suggested
that participants in the RDA group actually consumed 0.9 g
protein $ kg21 $ d21, a consequence of our intention that all
diets achieve $0.8 g protein $ kg21 $ d21. It should be noted
that the RDA calculated based on nitrogen balance studies is
0.84 g protein $ kg21 $ d21 (9). Therefore, the discrepancy
between the expected and actual intake in the RDA group is
likely minimal.
Both study diets were omnivorous and contained dairy, meat,
and fish. To accommodate the prescribed protein and energy
specifications the RDA and 2RDA diets provided fewer and more,
respectively, animal products than participants’ habitual diets.
The inevitable differences in protein source between the diets
also meant concomitant differences in protein quality (40).
Thus, the type or quality of protein may have been responsible
for some observed effects. Providing higher-quality protein
(i.e., more animal products) without increasing total energy

 would be difficult to achieve in practice while consuming
standard whole foods and meeting targets for fat intake. Exact
protein-quality matching would only have been possible with a
contrived diet consisting of foods made primarily of individual
macronutrients, which would have greatly reduced the ecologi-
cal validity of the study.
The present study aimed to balance protein consumption
across 3 daily meals (30%, 30%, and 40%); yet participants’
habitual protein consumption was distributed as 20%, 30%, and
50%. It is possible that the change in protein distribution may
have partially mediated the observed changes in lean mass. It
has been suggested that it may be more productive to define
protein requirements per meal rather than per day (41). In
support, studies have shown a balanced rather than skewed
protein distribution is beneficial for maintenance of muscle mass
(42, 43).
This study provided participants with diets designed to meet
their current energy needs (24). Many participants reported
consuming habitual diets at baseline, which contained either too
much or too little energy to meet their estimated requirements.
This finding could be a reflection of true imbalances between
energy intake and requirements or could reflect known inac-
curacies of self-reported intake (44). Based on changes in body
composition, both groups were in an energy deficit of w200 kcal/d.
This observed energy deficit is likely due to the provision of less-
energy-dense foods in both intervention groups compared with
habitual diets, which achieved satiety at a lower energy intake
(45).
The confounding effects of an energy deficit on the loss of
appendicular muscle mass cannot be discounted; however, this
degree of energy deficit is less than what is recommended for
weight loss (500–750 kcal/d in older adults) (46) and did not
differ between groups. It has also been demonstrated previously
that high-protein diets may preserve lean mass during periods of
energy deficit. Both groups displayed comparable absolute fat
loss, whereas only the RDA group lost appendicular muscle
mass. Correcting for the degree of energy deficit did not alter the
findings, suggesting that differences in energy intake per se were
not responsible for group differences in body composition.
Accompanying the w90% difference in protein intake in the
2RDA diet compared with the RDA diet, there was also
an w10% lower fat intake in the 2RDA group, which cannot be
discounted as a contributor to the observed body composition
differences. The study was also limited by a lack of a control
group, with the maintenance of habitual diet; thus, it is unknown
what alterations in weight or body composition would have been
evident after 10 additional wk of habitual diet.
Our results show consistent increases in lean mass among the
group consuming the 2RDA diet compared with the RDA diet,
primarily driven by increases in lean mass in the trunk region.
Although this change could be explained by a gain in muscu-
lature, it is more likely that nonmuscle lean tissue in this region
made a substantial contribution. Animal studies have reported
hypertrophy of organs, such as the liver and kidney, in response to
high-protein diets (47, 48). MRI would have been required to
definitively identify the contribution of skeletal muscle, viscera,
and gut to the observed changes in lean mass indistinguishable
with the use of DXA as in the current study. In contrast, the
appendicular lean mass decline in the RDA group is likely more
reflective of skeletal muscle mass than whole-body lean mass
(49) because there is minimal tissue that is not muscle in the limbs
that would be segmented as lean mass by the DXA (50). Our
results suggest that appendicular lean mass loss can be caused by
insufficient protein intake, yet higher protein intake does not
necessarily induce muscle hypertrophy in the absence of in-
creased physical activity. Resistance training (51) or other high-
intensity exercise (52) is normally required to induce muscle

 hypertrophy, which may be further increased with additional
protein intake; this response has, however, been shown to be
blunted in older adults (53).
In the present study, the common SPPB and TUG were used to
assess whole-body physical function. The recruited elderly men
exhibited a high level of physical functioning (54), and neither of
these tests was altered by dietary intervention. Because these tests
lack sensitivity and display a celling effect in highly functional
adults (55), the assessment of muscle power may provide a more
sensitive assessment of physical function (23, 56). Our results
show an increase in muscle power only in the 2RDA group,
indicating a possible increase in physical function. This was
independent of detectible changes in muscle size, making the
mechanism unclear; however, greater changes in muscle power
than in size have also been reported previously with aging (57).
There is increasing epidemiologic evidence for the beneficial
impact of higher-protein diets for the preservation of skeletal
muscle mass and function in the elderly (8). Most previous in-
tervention studies have manipulated protein intake with supple-
ments rather than whole foods (19). In this study, the careful control
of protein intake to achieve the RDA (0.8 g protein $ kg21 $ d21)
for 10 wk led to a reduction in total protein intake from the ha-
bitual 1.2 g protein $ kg21 $ d21 accompanied by an w200-kcal/d
energy deficit and resulted in a loss of appendicular lean mass and grip
strength. In contrast, raising the intake to 1.6 g protein $ kg21 $ d21
(2RDA for protein), with a comparable energy deficit, increased
whole-body lean mass and knee-extension peak power output, without
changing appendicular lean mass or thigh muscle cross-sectional area.
