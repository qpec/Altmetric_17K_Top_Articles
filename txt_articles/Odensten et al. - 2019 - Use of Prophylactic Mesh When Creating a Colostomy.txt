Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether parastomal hernia
(PSH) rate can be reduced by using synthetic mesh in the sublay position when
constructing permanent end colostomy. The secondary aim was to investigate
possible side-effects of the mesh.
Background: Prevention of PSH is important as it often causes discomfort and
leakage from stoma dressing. Different methods of prevention have been tried,
including several mesh techniques. The incidence of PSH is high; up to 78%.
Methods: Randomized controlled double-blinded multicenter trial. Patients
undergoing open colorectal surgery, including creation of a permanent end
colostomy, were randomized into 2 groups, with and without mesh. A
lightweight polypropylene mesh was placed around the colostomy in the
sublay position. Follow up after 1 month and 1 year. Computerized tomogra-
phy and clinical examination were used to detect PSH at the 1-year follow up.
Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis.
Results: After 1 year, 211 of 232 patients underwent clinical examination
and 198 radiologic assessments. Operation time was 36 minutes longer in the
mesh arm. No difference in rate of PSH was revealed in the analyses of
clinical (P ¼ 0.866) and radiologic (P ¼ 0.748) data. There was no significant
difference in perioperative complications.
Conclusions: The use of reinforcing mesh does not alter the rate of PSH. No
difference in complication rate was seen between the 2 arms. Based on these
results, the prophylactic use of mesh to prevent PSH cannot be recommended.

P
arastomal hernia (PSH) is a common complication after stomal
surgery. Though the exact incidence hasnot been fully established,
figures range between a few and 78%.1–3 Most PSHs develop within
2 years of surgery but can occur up to 30 years later. Approximately,
one third of patients operated for rectal cancer in Sweden have a
permanent colostomy, and 24% to 39% of patients with a ‘‘temporary’’
stoma never have it reversed.4–6 PSH causes difficulties with stoma
dressing and leakage, increases the risk for incarceration, and has a
negative impact on the patient’s quality of life.7–9
A number of strategies have been proposed to prevent the
formation of PSH after primary surgery: choice of stoma placement
through versus lateral to the rectus sheath, transperitoneal versus
extraperitoneal, and correct sizing of the trephine.2,10 None of these
seems to reduce the incidence of PSH. Furthermore reported 30-day
morbidity and mortality rates of planned repair procedures are 8% to
36% and 0% to 5%, respectively 11–13 Emergency PSH repair has a
reported mortality rate of 11% to 25%.14,15 The development of
stoma techniques that reduce the risk for PSH is thus a field of
research that should be given priority.
Placement of a mesh to prevent PSH formation has been
proposed. Eight small and 2 large randomized controlled trials (RCT)
have been published during the past 2 decades. Pooled data from
these studies show promising results,16 though mesh location, choice
of mesh material and surgical approach varied.17–23 The use of mesh
did not increase complication rate, but none of the trials was designed
to assess complication. On the contrary, 1 retrospective trial com-
paring PSH rate before and after the introduction of routine prophy-
lactic mesh around the stoma, at a unit that repeatedly produced top
results in the Swedish Rectal Cancer Registry, showed no difference
in complication rates between groups.24 The Swedish National Board
of Health and Welfare classifies the use of prophylactic mesh around
stomas as, ‘‘Research and Development,’’ because of the weak
scientific evidence; larger RCTs comparing prophylactic mesh with
no mesh are required.25
In view of this uncertainty, we designed a double-blinded
multicenter RCT to evaluate the effects of using a prophylactic mesh
around the stoma. The primary aim was to evaluate the PSH rate in
both groups, and a secondary aim was to assess the risk for early
complications. Our hypothesis was that polypropylene mesh in the
sublay position around a colostomy decreases the risk for PSH.
METHODS
Study Design
The study was designed as a double-blinded multicenter RCT.
Patients were randomized to 2 groups, those with and those without
prophylactic mesh around the stoma. The study protocol adhered to
the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Regional Ethics
Committee at Umea
˚ University, Sweden (DNR 07-081 M). The study
was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT00917995) and
adhered to the CONSORT 2010 criteria for RCTs.
Patients
All patients scheduled for permanent colostomy at one of the
participating hospitals and who met the inclusion criteria (no previ-
ous stoma; older than 18 years; and with informed consent), were
eligible to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria were: expected
survival less than 3 years; fecal peritonitis; previous stoma; and no
informed consent.

RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL
 Surgery
Colostomy without mesh was taken through the rectus muscle,
at a site marked by a stoma therapist before surgery. The height of the
stomal nipple was at least 1 cm, and neither intraabdominal lateral
closure nor fixation to the fascia was performed. Mucocutaneous
interrupted monofilament sutures were used to fix the stoma to
the skin.
Colostomy with mesh incorporated a lightweight polypropyl-
ene mesh (density 25–40 g/m2) in the sublay position. A 10 � 10 cm
space for the mesh was created dorsal to the rectus abdominis muscle
but anterior to the posterior rectus sheath and peritoneum. The bowel
was passed through the rectus muscle via a cruciform incision in the
middle of the mesh. Single nonabsorbable monofilament sutures
anchored the mesh laterally in the pocket. Medially the mesh was
incorporated in the running suture closing the fascia. A potential risk
is that the mesh would not reach the midline; however, no such effect
was described in the original article.26 The surgical technique used
had been described in an earlier study comparing stoma with and
without prophylactic mesh.26 An instruction video, made by Israel-
sson et al at the Department of Surgery, Sundsvall, was distributed to
all participating centers to ensure that a uniform surgical technique
was used. Fixation to the skin was performed with the same
technique as when creating a colostomy without mesh. Surgery
was performed by an experienced colorectal surgeon with an annual
volume of at least 100 major surgical procedures.
Postoperative mobilization was according to each hospital’s
routine.
Study Outcome
Early complications were evaluated at 1 month, and late
complications and possible recurrence of parastomal hernia were
assessed at a 1-year follow up. The examiner was blinded to the
group the patient was randomized to. Primary endpoint was the rate
of parastomal hernia in both groups, judged clinically and by
computerized tomography (CT) 1 year after surgery. Clinical exami-
nation was performed in both upright and supine positions by digital
palpation within the stoma at rest and during the Valsalva maneuver.
Findings were classified as a bulge or PSH. Definition of a bulge was
a protrusion around the stoma noticed by the surgeon and/or the
patient but deemed not to be a hernia clinically. CTwas performed in
the supine position, with or without intravenous contrast; the Val-
salva maneuver was not performed. All CT examinations were
evaluated by a radiologist with a special interest in parastomal
hernia. The findings were classified according to the Moreno-Matias
scale, classified as validated by the European Hernia Society, based
on the content of the hernia: no hernia ¼ 0; bowel forming the stoma
with hernia sac < 5 cm ¼ IA; bowel forming the stoma with hernia
sac > 5 cm ¼ IB; hernia sac containing omentum ¼ II; and hernia sac
containing loop other than bowel forming the stoma ¼ III.27,28
Sample Size
As the vast majority of patients receiving a colostomy are
operated for colorectal cancer, a 5-year survival rate around 50% is
likely. Assuming a parastomal hernia incidence of 20% 7 without and
5% with mesh, a 5-year survival rate of just over 50%, and a
significance level of 95%, it would require 220 patients to achieve
a power of 80%.
Randomization and Blinding
Randomization was performed using sealed envelopes, strati-
fied per hospital in blocks of four, to ensure balance between the 2
arms. The envelopes were prepared by the Regional Cancer Center
North, Umea
˚ University Hospital, in bundles of 100 per hospital,
without the help of the investigators. Neither the patient nor the
surgeon assessing the patient postoperatively was informed on which
arm the patient had been randomized to. Postoperative assessment
was made by a surgeon not involved in the primary procedure. If
randomization of a patient was performed incorrectly, the patient was
replaced by 3 new patients to ensure maintenance of power.
Data Collection
Data were collected prospectively and patients were followed
by protocol with individual case report forms (CRF). All data were
entered into an Excel-database.
After completion of inclusion, a separate analysis was per-
formed to describe the cohort of patients who met the inclusion
criteria but were not included in the study. To obtain a representative
group of ‘‘not included’’ patients, all other colostomy operations
performed during the inclusion/trial period at Umea
˚ University
Hospital, Sunderby Regional Hospital and Mora County Hospital
were assessed for demographic data and reasons for not being
included.
Statistical Analysis
The IBM SPSS Statistics 24 software program was used. All
analyses of group variables were performed with the x2 test and all
analyses of continuous variables were performed with the indepen-
dent Student t test; a P< 0.05 was considered significant. The
population was tested for skewness and kurtosis (measure describing
outliers in a data set) using SPSS Statistics. As normal distribution
was shown, parametric statistics were used.
RESULTS
Eight hospitals participated in the study: 4 university hospitals
(Karolinska University Hospitals in Huddinge and Solna, Stockholm,
Uppsala University Hospital, and Umea
˚ University hospital); 2
regional hospitals (Sunderby Regional Hospital and Helsingborg
Regional Hospital); and 2 county hospitals (Mora County Hospital
and Nyko
¨ping County Hospital). The total catchment area of the 8
hospitals is approximately 1,475,000 individuals; approximately
15% of the Swedish population.
From December 2007 through October 2015, 240 patients
were enrolled in the trial (Fig. 1). All operations were planned and
performed according to a standard protocol within the National
Health Service. Eight patients were enrolled in the study but had
to be excluded because of change in surgical approach during the
operation. Seven of these patients had been excluded and 21 new
patients included and randomized according to the study design.
Unfortunately, when all CRFs had reached the study center, one more
patient had to be excluded, and could not be replaced as the trial had
been closed.
There was no significant difference in baseline data
between the mesh group and the nonmesh group (Table 1) apart
from duration of surgery, which was significantly longer in the
mesh group (P ¼ 0.019).
Comparison of patients in the ‘‘not included’’ group, that is,
meeting the inclusion criteria but not included, with those in the
STOMAMESH trial group, showed significantly lower proportions
undergoing emergency surgery (P < 0.001) and with ASA-class 3
(P < 0.001) in the study group. Furthermore, patients in the study
population were older (P ¼ 0.010) (Table 2).
When excluding emergency procedures from both groups
differences in age, ASA, and operation time between the 2 groups
remained (Table 3).
No significant differences were found when data were strati-
fied according to hospital.

 After 1 year, 211 of 232 patients included (91%) were
followed up clinically, and 198 of 232 patients (85%) were examined
with CT (Fig. 1). According to the requisites for the original power
calculation, this gives a de facto power of 91%. Reasons for being
lost to follow up were: incomplete follow up because of surgical
complication (3 patients); progression of disease (1 patient); devel-
opment of dementia (1 patient); refusal of patient to participate
further in the study (9 patients); and death (7 patients). When
comparing the mesh and nonmesh groups, there was no significant
difference in the rate of bulge (P ¼ 0.631), clinically judged PSH
(P ¼ 0.866), or PSH on the CT (P ¼ 0.748) (Table 4). There was no
difference in complication rates at 1-month follow up between the
groups (Table 5). Reoperations performed during the first postoper-
ative month were because of small bowel obstruction requiring
adhesiolysis (1 in each group), conversion to transverse colostomy
(1 in the mesh group), revision of the enterostomy (2 in the mesh
group and 3 in the nonmesh group), bleeding (2 in the mesh group),
superficial/deep infection (1 in each group), and wound rupture (1 in
the nonmesh group). A further 2 patients in the nonmesh group and 4
patients in the nonmesh group were reoperated within the first
postoperative year. At the 1-year follow up, a total of 8 patients
in the nonmesh and 12 in the mesh group had been reoperated.
DISCUSSION
This trial, the largest multicenter RCT on stomal surgery in
routine healthcare, revealed no difference in PSH rate between pro-
cedures incorporating a prophylactic mesh around the stoma and those
with no mesh. Complication and reoperation rates did not differ
between groups. Compared with previously published trials analyzing
the use of mesh instomal surgery, thecurrent trial was basedon a larger
population and a systematic follow up including both clinical and CT
assessment of PSH. Furthermore, this study was multicenter and thus

 represents the use of mesh in normal clinical practice using well-
established routines. It covers most regions in Sweden, and represents
approximately 15% of the population. Furthermore, unlike other
studies, this study was blinded to both patient and examiner, which
could be an explanation for the diverging results.18–20,26 This trial also
includes different types of hospital and levels of specialization,
whereas most previous trials are from single specialist Institu-
tions.20,22,26,29 The trial reached a de facto power of 91%. The only
significant difference found between the 2 treatment arms was a longer
operation time (median 38 minutes) for the mesh group corresponding
tothetimeexpectedforapplication ofthemesh.Interestingly,ina large
retrospective study in Sweden including 206 patients, reported from a
single institution, it was not possible to show a difference in PSH
between procedures with or without mesh.24 Follow-up assessment in
thattrial alsoincluded bothclinical investigationandCT.That trialwas
carried out at a high-volume single center with top results in the
Swedish Rectal Cancer Registry.4 This center did not participate in the
STOMAMESH trial, but had similar results.
We also describe the patient group eligible for inclusion but
not taking part, the ‘‘not included’’ group, a procedure rarely
performed in previous trials.18,19,21,22,26,29
A potential weakness of this study is that we choose to
investigate the population of ‘‘not included’’ patients at 3 hospitals
(Sunderby, Umea
˚, and Mora), to get a representative sample, instead
of doing this at all participating hospitals. Furthermore, the choice to
use routine CT might also be considered a weakness. In some studies,
the patients were placed in the supine position or performed the
Valsalva maneuver during the examination.30 This might have
increased the sensitivity of CT in this study. The reason not doing
this is that abdominal CT scan with the patient in the supine position
is standard. An additional CT with Valsalva would have increased
radiation exposure and would have demanded extra resources, thus
deviating from routine practice. The majority of CT scans were
included in routine colorectal cancer follow up at the hospitals
participating. It would seem unlikely; however, that this difference
in CT follow up should favor one or other of the treatment arms.
The reason for choosing the sublay polypropylene mesh
technique was that this had been investigated in a number of previous
studies and that laparoscopic surgery had not been accepted as
standard practice in Sweden, 2005. Open surgery was thus the
natural choice.
Only 1 patient in the STOMAMESH population had emer-
gency surgery whereas 96 (22.4%) in the ‘‘not included’’ population
were operated as an emergency. This was a systematic error in the
study design but does not entirely explain the differences in ASA and
age. One might argue that we should have excluded emergency
procedures in the study design. Consequently, we cannot extrapolate
the results from elective surgery to those having emergency surgery
with a contaminated abdomen.
This study did not investigate or quantify symptoms arising
fromPSH.It iswell knownthatnot all PSHs actuallycausesymptoms 7
and this has been used as an argument against the use of prophylactic
mesh. The PSH rate in our study was more than three times that in a
recent review article (29.4% vs 8.9%),16 implying that results from
smallerstudiesperformedatsingleinstitutionswithaspecialinterestin
PSH are difficult to extrapolate to routine clinical practice. The
meticulous follow up in this study might well have generated the
higher PSH rates. No negative side-effects of prophylactic mesh were
detected despite the rather large trial population.
There have been several trials studying PSH, and the majority
has shown positive results regardless of which prophylactic mesh is
used when forming a colostomy.16 These authors recommend the use
of mesh when creating a colostomy. The results from the current
study do not support this conclusion. Comparing our trial with the
Dutch trial,18 which was second largest and the one most similar in
design to ours, the Dutch trial did not include routine CT follow up
and blinding which could explain the difference in results. In view of
the dubious need for prophylactic mesh and the divergent trial results
to date, we cannot recommend the use of prophylactic mesh when
creating a colostomy. Furthermore, we do not have a clear picture of
how many patients who develop a PSH suffer symptoms related to
their PSH. The most promising results have been reported using mesh
for repair of PSH, including the Sugarbaker procedure.29,31 Morbid-
ity risk with mesh repair is high and deaths have been reported.16,32,33
There are reports of long-term complications from mesh implanta-
tion in the form of discomfort, pain, and fistula formation.33–35
Should mesh be used prophylactically on a large scale, the incidence
of these complications would likely increase. In fact, long-term
follow-up studies on the use of prophylactic parastomal mesh are
rare indeed.

 CONCLUSIONS
In routine surgical care, no difference in rate of PSH can be
seen when creating an elective colostomy with or without a reinforc-
ing mesh. The management of PSH is still a considerable surgical
challenge and there is no generally accepted method for its preven-
tion. Further research should focus on developing preventive mea-
sures and improving methods for PSH repair.
