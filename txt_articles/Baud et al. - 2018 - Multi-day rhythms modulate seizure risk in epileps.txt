Epilepsy is defined by the seemingly random occurrence of spontaneous seizures. The ability
to anticipate seizures would enable preventative treatment strategies. A central but unre-
solved question concerns the relationship of seizure timing to fluctuating rates of interictal
epileptiform discharges (here termed interictal epileptiform activity, IEA), a marker of brain
irritability observed between seizures by electroencephalography (EEG). Here, in 37 subjects
with an implanted brain stimulation device that detects IEA and seizures over years, we find
that IEA oscillates with circadian and subject-specific multidien (multi-day) periods. Multi-
dien periodicities, most commonly 20–30 days in duration, are robust and relatively stable for
up to 10 years in men and women. We show that seizures occur preferentially during the
rising phase of multidien IEA rhythms. Combining phase information from circadian and
multidien IEA rhythms provides a novel biomarker for determining relative seizure risk with a
large effect size in most subjects.

aily to monthly patterns in seizure occurrence have been
described since antiquity1 but only recently quantified,
revealing circadian2–4, and cluster organization5,6. The
existence of such patterns suggests that brain activity is regulated
over long timescales. Despite recent progress in using features of
interictal brain activity to forecast imminent seizures7–10, con-
troversy remains regarding the relationship between seizures and
interictal epileptiform discharges (e.g., spike-waves, polyspikes,
and fast oscillations)11–13. The rate of these pathological dis-
charges (here termed interictal epileptiform activity, IEA) fluc-
tuates over time and may increase or decrease before seizures.
This suggests that IEA and seizures are dissociable but influenced
by a common process14, one that may be periodic. Observation of
such a process requires chronic recordings of brain activity cap-
turing multiple cycles15.
Recently, an FDA-approved closed-loop implantable brain
stimulator for detecting and treating seizures (NeuroPace, Inc.
RNS® System, hereafter referred to as ‘RNS System’) has afforded
an unprecedented opportunity to monitor human brain activity
with intracranial recordings continuously over many years. The
RNS System involves a programmable neurostimulator connected
to intracranial electrodes recording neural activity at the seizure
focus or foci. Storage of raw EEG on the device is limited, but
customizable algorithms are used to record hourly counts of
epileptiform discharges (IEA) and timestamps of seizures. These
data sets are well-suited for analysis of IEA rhythms at long
timescales. Here, using wavelet transform to decompose IEA
time-series, we identify multidien rhythms16 with period lengths
that are variable across, but relatively stable within, male and
female subjects over years of recording. Seizures occur pre-
ferentially on the days-long up-slope of the multidien rhythm,
independent of period length. Specific circadian timing of seizures
is more variable across subjects, but we show that, at the indi-
vidual level, multidien and circadian IEA rhythms are co-
determinants of seizure risk.
Results
Subjects. We studied 37 subjects (22 males; age range 22–58) with
epilepsy who had been implanted with the RNS System (Fig. 1a)
for approved clinical indications. Lead placements included
mesial temporal (N = 23) and neocortical regions (N = 14) and
were bilateral in 20 subjects (Supplementary Table 1). Recording
durations were 3 months to 9.9 years (median: 2.3 y). For this
study, IEA is defined as hourly rates of detections of epileptiform
discharges using subject-specific algorithms designed by clinicians
(Supplementary Fig. 1a).
Characterization of circadian and multidien rhythms of IEA.
We formatted IEA rate (Fig. 1b, c) into continuous time-series
and applied wavelet transform to resolve component rhythmicity
of the IEA (signal processing steps depicted in detail in Supple-
mentary Figs. 2 and 3). Individual subjects showed clear circadian
variation (Fig. 1d, h), and multidien rhythms were also apparent
in daily averages of IEA plotted over long periods (Fig. 1e, i, j,
Supplementary Fig. 4). Spectral decomposition (Fig. 1f, g) revealed
the expected peaks in ultradian (12 h) and circadian (24 h)
rhythms3,17,18, as well as longer periodicities (5.5–33 days) in
most subjects (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 4). The median ratio of
multidien to circadian peak amplitude was 1.4 (range 0.4–5.7;
>1.0 in 27 subjects), suggesting that the multidien rhythm was as
robust as the circadian rhythm in most subjects. The most
common periodicities were 26–30 days (N = 18) followed by
20–22 days (N = 16, Fig. 2b). Intra-subject autocorrelation coef-
ficients in the frequency-domain over time were above 0.5 for all
(0.72 ± 0.07, Supplementary Fig. 5a, b, e), reflecting relative
stability of these rhythms. Intra-subject correlation of period-
ograms derived from bihemispheric recordings was 0.93 ± 0.05
(N = 8, Supplementary Fig. 5c, d), suggesting that IEA rhythms in
anatomically distinct seizure foci are co-regulated. All subjects
exhibited a 12-h harmonic of the circadian rhythm and some
subjects also had harmonics of multidien rhythms, for example
with peaks at 7.5 and 15 days (Supplementary Fig. 6). Unsu-
pervised clustering of the periodograms based on their coeffi-
cients for principal components (Supplementary Fig. 7) showed
three patterns of multidien rhythms: (i) about weekly and
biweekly (N = 9), (ii) about tri-weekly (N = 12), and (iii) about
monthly (N = 16) peaks (Fig. 2a). This analysis was done mainly
for visualization purposes, as there was no strong categorical
separation of the data. Rather, the range of periods was a con-
tinuum, sometimes with two or three peaks in the same subject
(Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 4). Subjects demonstrating these
patterns did not differ significantly by region of seizure onset (p =
0.87, χ2-test). Male and female subjects showed a similar dis-
tribution of periodicities (p = 0.87, χ2-test, Fig. 2b). Multidien
rhythms remained apparent during times when the stimulation
function of the RNS System was disabled (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Phase analysis of IEA peak in relation to circadian time. To
complement this power analysis with time information, a phase
analysis of the circadian IEA rhythm revealed that the peak
aligned consistently with a given hour in all subjects (p < 0.001,
Omnibus test, Fig. 3). Unsupervised clustering showed three
groups with peaks around 4:00 PM, 2:00 AM, and 6:00 AM,
which may represent different IEA chronotypes19 (Fig. 3). These
findings are consistent with a prior study showing peak nocturnal
occurrence of IEA independent of the region of seizure onset (p =
0.14, χ2-test)3.
Phase analysis of seizure timing relative to IEA rhythms. Next,
we investigated the relationship of seizures to the phase of the
underlying circadian and multidien IEA rhythms in a subset of
subjects (N = 14) for whom seizure detection by the RNS System
was highly reliable (estimated ~2% false positives, see Methods
section). Average seizure rate across these subjects ranged from
one seizure every 17 days to 32 seizures per day, with a median
total number of seizures of 325 (range 74–115,154). Circular
statistics of seizure timing confirmed significant entrainment to
circadian and multidien rhythms in 12 and 13 out of 14 subjects,
respectively (Omnibus test, p-values in Fig. 4). Across subjects,
the average phase-locking value (PLV, equal to the resultant
vector length) was similar for circadian and multidien rhythms
(Fig. 4a, b; p = 0.63, Wilcoxon test), suggesting that seizures were
tied as strongly to a given phase of multidien rhythms as to
circadian rhythms. However, the population of angles was sig-
nificantly different (p = 0.002, Kuiper test), spanning from trough
to peak of circadian rhythms and from up-slope to peak of
multidien rhythms. Seizures were therefore coupled to multidien
rhythms over a more narrow range of phases than to circadian
rhythms. Circadian and multidien PLVs correlated weakly
(Pearson r = 0.36, p = 0.20). To further explore the relationship
between circadian and multidien timing, individual seizures were
mapped on the circadian vs. multidien phase-space (see Methods
section and Fig. 5), revealing uncorrelated grouping of seizures at
preferred circadian and multidien phases independent of the
underlying period (Fig. 5). Multidien PLVs inversely correlated
with seizure rate (Pearson r = −0.7, p = 0.005, Supplementary
Fig. 8). Thus, seizures are more tightly coupled to the preferred
multidien phase in subjects with low or moderate seizure rates
(the majority in this study) than in subjects with high seizure
rates.

 Seizure risk modulation by circadian and multidien rhythms.
We estimated differences in effect size across subjects by calcu-
lating the risk of having a seizure at a given circadian or multidien
phase relative to the risk of not having a seizure at the same
phase. When combining phase information from the underlying
circadian and multidien rhythms, we found small (risk ratio (RR)
1.2, 95% CI: 1.1–1.3) to very large effect sizes (RR 24.5, 95% CI:
3.4–175.9) in subjects with high and low seizure rates, respec-

 found when the two critical phases were combined (Fig. 6). When
multidien and circadian rhythms were both anti-phase, seizures
were rare in 5 out of 14 subjects (S3, S5, S24, S30, and S33).
Discussion
Our results reveal that, in addition to well-known circadian
rhythms, IEA fluctuates with slower multidien rhythms that vary
across subjects but are relatively stable within subjects over many
years. Furthermore, seizures occur preferentially during narrow
phases of these circadian and multidien rhythms. Thus, seizures
are organized by underlying biological rhythms that operate over
multiple timescales and jointly modulate seizure risk.
Previous applications of quantitative methods to chronic
intracranial recordings have elegantly characterized distributions
of seizure durations and inter-seizure intervals5,20, established
power-law relationships linking past and future seizures6, and
identified circadian and ultradian patterns2–4. One study using an
autocorrelation method in the time-domain found cyclical pat-
terns of IEA ranging in duration from weeks to 1 month in a
limited number of subjects4. Here we took advantage of longer
recordings and frequency-domain statistical analyses designed for
the study of oscillations at any scale. Our study is distinguished by
the elucidation of multidien rhythms in most subjects, often with
greater magnitude than circadian modulation. This is remarkable
as multidien rhythms were present covertly in all-comers, even
though most did not have obvious periodicity of their epilepsy,
underscoring the value of monitoring IEA as a biomarker of
disease activity. In comparison with previous contributions4, the
key insight from our work is that, across subjects with diverse
focal epilepsies, seizure timing depends on the phase of the
multidien rhythm, explaining how seizures tend to form clusters
with long-range dependencies5,6,20. This phenomenon could only
be elucidated with long timescale recordings of IEA and seizures,
and the importance of using this wider temporal lens to view and
anticipate seizure dynamics represents a major conceptual
advance. Indeed, the time window of pre-seizure activity relevant
for seizure prediction may be on the scale of days rather than
hours as previously thought10,21. Overall, seizure occurrence was
best explained by incorporating information about circadian and
multidien rhythms. Reliable real-time seizure prediction will
likely involve a combinatorial function of multiple features of an
individual’s epilepsy, including past and present seizure char-
acteristics and short and long-term IEA trends. Multidien and
circadian rhythms may be most predictive in subjects with a low
or moderate seizure rate where phase preference is highest.
The data presented here, based on analysis of thousands of
seizures, help reconcile conflicting evidence regarding the rela-
tionship between IEA and seizures. Previous studies have repor-
ted that IEA increases, decreases, or remains unchanged before
seizures4,11,22, and IEA trends after seizures are also vari-
able11,23,24. Seizures preferentially occur during the rising phase
of multidien IEA cycles, but, in a given subject, this could coin-
cide with the peak or the trough of the circadian IEA cycle4,
perhaps explaining how shorter timescale studies, looking at
hour-to-hour changes in IEA, could draw seemingly contra-
dictory conclusions. Similarly, day-to-day changes in IEA may
not explain seizure timing as well as the phase of the underlying
slow oscillation. A major advantage of our study is that chronic
recordings were made in ambulatory subjects under natural
conditions, i.e., without tapering anticonvulsant medications,
which is typical of acute inpatient recordings and known to affect
IEA24.
Our findings challenge the concept of a direct, generalizable
relationship between IEA and seizures and favor a hypothesis that
these epilepsy phenomena covary under differential influence of
factors operating at multiple timescales. A slow permittivity
variable was recently identified in an elegant mathematical model
of epilepsy25, and our results support the existence of an uni-
dentified factor (or factors) regulating slow epileptic fluctua-
tions26, possibly through changes in brain metabolism27 or circuit
function28. Further analysis of the rise and decay kinetics of IEA
fluctuations may be informative with regard to underlying bio-
logical mechanisms. We speculate that the seemingly independent
circadian and multidien oscillators may in fact be co-modulated
by hormonal, genetic, environmental29, sleep-wake cycle30, and
behavioral factors31. Hormonal influence on seizures occurs in
catamenial epilepsy32,33, and one of the 15 female subjects had
seizures related to menstrual cycles32,33 with IEA cycling at 13
and 26 days. However, we observed similar rhythmicity in men,
so catamenial cycling cannot explain our results.
This study has limitations. Our subjects, who have medically
refractory focal epilepsy, may not be representative of all patients
with epilepsy. These subjects also received therapeutic brain sti-
mulation. We cannot exclude the possibility that stimulation
influenced the rhythms we observed, but the stability of these
rhythms despite parameter changes, including turning stimula-
tion off, strongly argues against this. Given that patient subjective
reports are notoriously inaccurate for seizure quantification34,
with systematic negative bias for certain seizure types (amnestic
and nocturnal), we focused our study on objective quantification
of electrographic seizures recorded with the device and not on
clinical seizures. It is possible that clinical seizures have unique
relationships to IEA rhythms22, but our findings are consistent

 with the nearly 80-year-old observation that clinical seizures
demonstrate multidien periodicities in men and women26. IEA
counts analyzed here depend on detection parameters that were
dynamically adjusted based on clinical indications, and the RNS
System stores limited continuous raw EEG. Changes in detection
sensitivity impact the absolute IEA count, but our statistical
approach accounts for this by relying on relative fluctuations
within periods of constant detection settings. Finally, our study
was retrospective, but leveraging knowledge of subject-specific
multidien and circadian rhythms for prospective seizure predic-
tion remains a major goal of future work.
Multidien rhythms have been identified in mood disorders35,
sleep patterns30, and cardiovascular physiology36, and their role
in epilepsy will further fuel investigations into the underlying
biological mechanisms. An endocrine basis seems likely37,38. For
example, cortisol levels are positively correlated with IEA in some
forms of epilepsy39, and endogenous neurosteroids, hormonal
modulators of GABA receptors, fluctuate over time and possess
anticonvulsant properties40. Knowledge of these mechanisms and
the ability to anticipate epochs of heightened seizure risk may
enable dynamic, personalized treatment strategies41.
Methods
Subjects. We recruited 37 subjects (22 males) who had been implanted with the
RNS System for purely clinical indications for at least 3 months and up to 9.9 years
(median: 2.25 years) across two neurology centers (University of California, San
Francisco, N = 11, and California Pacific Medical Center, N = 26). The two Insti-
tutional Review Boards approved the study and written informed consent was
obtained from all subjects. Subjects had a variety of focal epilepsies (Supplementary
Table 1). Indications for treatment with the RNS System as opposed to resective
surgery included bilateral seizure localization (temporal and frontal), seizures
arising from eloquent cortex (motor and visual), and previous contralateral
resection.
Data selection. Detection of epileptiform activity by the RNS System relies on
user-configurable tools (line length, area under the curve, and bandpass filtering)
for which thresholds are optimized to detect seizure onset patterns42. Examples of
subject-specific epileptiform activity detected by the RNS System have been
reported previously3 and are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Hourly detection
counts are stored by the RNS System for the last 28 days and are continuous as long
as subjects download device data at least this often. For each subject, we discarded
data recorded from the day of implant until reliable detection of seizures and IEA
was achieved during the first few outpatient visits (median number of visits: 2,
range: 1–11) a few months later (median: 29 days, range: 2–90 days; Supplementary
Fig. 4). Sixteen subjects who did not download device data regularly had resultant
gaps in detection counts. The data containing gaps longer than 6 days was con-
sidered discontinuous and analyzed in separate segments. The data of <90 days
surrounded by gaps was discarded. Gaps up to 6 days were interpolated (see
below). One subject (S4) underwent resective surgery and the device continued to
record. This data were discarded. For visualization purposes daily counts were
obtained by averaging 24 h of data on the same calendar date, but actual analyses
were performed on the original hourly count data.
Due to memory constraints, the RNS System can store only a limited number of
raw EEGs at a given time. Seizure detection with the RNS System relies instead on a
surrogate marker, long-epileptiform activity (LEA; also termed ‘Long Episode’ by
others3,42), which occurs when the EEG signal meets detection criteria for a
clinician-specified length of time (typically, the minimum duration of each subject’s
electrographic seizure; LEA durations for this study ranged from 15 to 40 s, with an
average of 26.8 s). Like detection counts, LEA timestamp information is stored by
the device and available for analysis. Although generally a reliable proxy for
seizures43, LEA can also represent epochs of abundant IEA that do not meet
criteria for electrographic seizures44 (Supplementary Fig. 1b). To avoid
contaminating seizure analysis with such false positives, we calculated for each
subject the positive predictive value (PPV) of LEA for electrographic seizures
(Supplementary Fig. 1c). For each subject, a Board-certified epileptologist (V.R.R.)
assessed whether individual LEA corresponded to true electrographic seizures by
visually reviewing corresponding EEGs. When possible (<300 LEA, 10 subjects), all
individual EEGs were reviewed and each was labeled as an electrographic seizure
(true positive) or as LEA other than an electrographic seizure (false positive). For
subjects with too many LEA EEGs for comprehensive review (N > 300,
27 subjects), 100 EEGs were randomly selected from epochs with stable detection
settings and a PPV was calculated for each epoch. Subjects (N = 3) who had <20
LEA were excluded from statistical analysis, because this was too low a number for
a histogram-based statistical technique (see below). In total, we included
14 subjects for whom LEA was a reliable surrogate for seizures (PPV >90%; mean
98%, range 92–100%; Supplementary Table 1). Thus, we estimate that <2% of LEA
used here may actually be sustained trains of IEA and that the rest represent true
electrographic seizures.
Time-series and wavelet analysis. Hourly IEA counts were normalized (z-score)
separately by block of recording between clinic visits so as to ensure stability of
detection settings and anticonvulsant medications for each block. Continuous
time-series were obtained by concatenating these individual blocks. Power and

Fig. 4 Phase preference of seizures in relation to underlying IEA rhythm. Seizure timing relative to phase of the underlying circadian (a) or multidien (b)
rhythm for each subject shown as the PLV and resultant angle (N = 14; p-values in (c,d), Omnibus test, see Methods section). On average, the PLV was not
different (p = 0.63, Wilcoxon test), but the angles were more tightly distributed and closer to the peak for the multidien as compared to the circadian
rhythm (p = 0.002, Kuiper two-sample test, see Methods section). For visualization purposes, individual circular histograms of seizure counts (percentage
of total count) for circadian (c) and multidien (d) rhythms are shown, ranked according to increasing multidien average phase (vertical bar position). p-
values for the Omnibus test shown in Figure. *p < 0.001. Color codes in (a) and (c) are the same as in Fig. 3 and represent hour of the day of peak circadian
rhythm. Color codes in (b) and (d) represent peak periodicity of multidien rhythm, illustrating that the preferred multidien phase is similar, regardless of the
exact period length. e Feather and polar plots showing stable direction and magnitude of phase preference assessed every 3 months in one subject (S13).
Color-coding establishes data correspondence between feather (left) and polar plot (right) and does not refer to color-bars in (b). The annual number of
seizures is displayed to show the decrease over years of treatment with the RNS System and the number of seizures included in each calculation

 phase of the hourly IEA counts time-series were obtained using a Morlet wavelet
transform for 89 period bins (scales) with increasing spacing: 1.2 h between 2.4 and
31.2 h, 2.4 h between 33.6 and 48 h, 4.8 h between 2.2 and 4 d, 12 h between 4.5 and
10 d, and 24 h between 11 and 45 d. Gaps in recordings, if relatively short, were
interpolated by a method similar to kriging in geostatistical and climatology
research45 (Supplementary Fig. 3). For each gap, the variance was calculated for
two windows, before and after the gap (each with same length as the gap itself).
This variance was used to cast the normalization curves for pseudo-random data
generated around a central tendency line directly connecting the means of the two
peri-gap windows above. This process was performed for each gap, and only for
gaps shorter than 20% of the period being analyzed (e.g., up to 2 days of inter-
polation allowed for a period of 10 days). Gaps were processed in increasing

 duration order, so that higher frequencies were not affected by interpolations
performed at lower frequencies. In addition, a cone of influence—the region of the
wavelet spectrum, shaped according to period length, in which edge effects impede
accurate periodic estimation—was discarded at the extremities and around gaps
too wide to be interpolated. The data could then be represented as a spectrogram of
power or phase over time (time-frequency analysis) with excluded data at the
extremities and around gaps (Supplementary Fig. 2). Power index in periodograms
was estimated for each individual scale (period bin) as the square root of the
average over time of the absolute value of complex wavelet coefficients. Principal
component analysis of all individual periodograms (Supplementary Fig. 3) was
used to extract recurrent patterns. The six first components were selected as they
explained 98.7% of the total variance in the frequency domain. Average period-
ograms were calculated for three separate clusters obtained by K-means (cosine
distance, rank of 3) on the principal components coefficients (Fig. 2). Peaks in
periodicity were defined as a positive-to-negative zero-crossing of the derivative of
the periodogram.
Instantaneous phase analysis. Phase at every time-point was calculated in the
frequency domain for a single band of wavelet coefficients corresponding to the
peak period ±33.3% (e.g., 24 ± 8 h, or 15 ± 5 d), so as to accommodate variation in
periodicity. Thus, at each time-point, the most powerful frequency within a range
would most influence the phase. The average and variance in period length were
calculated using the distance between two successive phase values of zero,
excluding gaps. Circadian epileptiform peak activity histograms were obtained by
counting occurrences within 1-h bins (24 bins, Fig. 3). Seizure phase histograms
were obtained by counting occurrences within 20-degree phase bins (18 bins from
–π to +π) for circadian and multidien rhythms (Fig. 4). Similarly, average ampli-
tude was obtained by calculating the mean and standard deviation of normalized
data for all time-points with phase contained within these bins. If more than one
multidien peak was present in the periodogram, we used the shortest (first) mul-
tidien periodicity to evaluate instantaneous phase. For visualization purposes,
signal was reconstructed for the peak periods ±33.3% using an inverse wavelet
transform (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). The phase-space representation
allowed for the study of seizure risk as it relates to circadian vs. multidien phase.
Scatterplots help visualize these relations abstracted from the fact that multidien
periods vary across subjects.
Statistics. The sample size was determined by the availability of data. Previous
studies have demonstrated quantitative analyses of these data sets with a relatively
small number of subjects5 (though our sample size is considerably larger in both
number of subjects and recording durations). Circular statistics can be applied
within-subject, and we investigated replicability across all subjects in our data set.
The only pre-established exclusion criterion was length of continuous recording of
<3 months, and we excluded seven recently implanted subjects for this reason.
Given the observational nature of the study, there was no replication of mea-
surements over time per se, though these long recordings and autocorrelation
analyses (Supplementary Fig. 5) serve as technical measures of within-subject
replicability. Values were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and plotted
as dots and error-bars, unless specified otherwise. For categorical distributions
(gender and seizure localization), we performed a χ2-test. For continuous variables,
we performed a Wilcoxon test. Autocorrelations to the average periodogram were
assessed at each time-point in the frequency domain using a Pearson coefficient
and averaged over the total length of recording for each individual. For eight
subjects with bilateral implants and >3 months of bilateral recordings, Pearson
coefficients were calculated on the periodograms derived from each site. Other
correlations were assessed using a linear model with intercept and the F-statistic vs.
a constant model. Seizure rate was log-transformed for regression models, as it had
a logarithmic distribution. Phase analyses were done using the 2012 Matlab circular
statistics toolbox by Dr. Philipp Berens46 including functions for circular mean,
circular standard deviation, and resultant vector. We used the circular variant of k-
means for clustering of angles. We used the Omnibus (or Hodges-Ajne) test to
calculate statistical significance for non-uniform angular distribution (against the
null hypothesis of a uniform distribution), as opposed to the more classical Ray-
leigh test, because some angular distributions were bimodal, especially in circadian
rhythms. We used the Kuiper test (analog to the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for
circular data) to calculate the statistical difference between two angle populations,

number of seizures on the right of (c), N). Note that data have been duplicated on the x and y-axes to emphasize complete cycles. Each dot represents one
to a few seizures happening during the same hour. P: peak, T: trough of underlying rhythms also represented with purple lines. The black (night,
6PM–6AM) and white (day, 6AM–6PM) boxes on the right y-axis represent approximate time of the day. Note the lack of correlation between the
circadian and multidien angles (i.e., they do not align on a diagonal). Pink boxes in S33 highlight that, for a given multidien phase, IEA could go up or down
in the hours before or after a seizure, depending on the circadian phase relative to peak (pink P). b Corresponding density plots representing risk ratio
(color-coded logarithmic scale) for bins of 20-degree circadian and multidien phase combination. Each pixel represents the risk of having a seizure at this
point in phase-space as compared to the risk of not having a seizure at this point. Green and cyan lines in (b) with corresponding green and cyan shading in
(a) (±90°) represent preferred phases of seizures in relation to underlying IEA rhythms (also visible in Fig. 4). In some subjects, seizures can occur at any
time of the day if in the at-risk multidien phase (S1, S5, S7, S13, and S24) and, conversely, in other subjects, seizures can occur on any day of the multidien
cycle if at specific times of the day (S4, S26, and S37). c Forest plot showing the risk ratio for having a seizure when in-phase vs. anti-phase with the

time-varying seizure risk, white lines depict the hypothetical circular
trajectory of a subject with a 24 h circadian and 8-day multidien cycle. Each
line covers two circadian cycles and a quarter multidien cycle. When
starting on the left line, the subject mostly crosses areas of low seizure RR
with the exception of medium RR at times of favored circadian timing
(arrowhead). In the second quarter (second line from left), the subject
crosses an area where multidien and circadian timing jointly increase
seizure RR (arrowhead). In the third quarter (third line from left), the
subject stays on an area of increased risk for two circadian cycles by
traveling on a vertical band of favored multidien phase (arrowhead). The
fourth quarter line joins the bottom of the first line to close the cycle. b

 as it makes no assumption on the underlying distributions. These descriptive
statistics, clustering methods, and tests in the circular domain have equivalents in
the linear domain but they take into account the fact that angles flip from π to –π,
creating numerical discontinuity. The mean resultant vector is a metric of phase
consistency of a population of angles. It is constructed by vectorial averaging of
phase vectors each of unitary length equal to one. Thus, the angle of the mean
resultant vector represents the mean angle of the population and its length (Phase-
Locking Value, PLV) represents dispersion (values close to zero) or concentration
(values close to one) of constituting angles. Given that the PLV is a continuous
variable linearly varying from zero to one, we used a Wilcoxon test to compare
population medians. To study the stability of this metric over time, we computed
repeated PLVs every 3 months including data over a year (±6 months at each time-
point, Fig. 4f). To study the map of seizure risk for each individual subject, we
binned seizure counts in the phase-space into 324 (18 × 18) 20-degrees circadian
and multidien phase combination elements. To reduce noise, we smoothed this
result with a 2D Gaussian kernel spanning two standard-deviations over ±40
degrees. Each single bin, containing the number of seizures that occurred at a given
phase combination, successively represented true positives (TP), whereas seizure
counts in the 323 other bins represented false negatives (FN). False positive (FP)
were the number of occurrence of a given phase combination (without seizures),
and True Negative (TN) were all the other phase combinations (without seizures).
The risk ratio was calculated as TP=ðTPþFPÞ
FN=ðTNþFNÞ. This was done for each bin resulting in
a map of ‘risk factor-seizure’ association (Fig. 5). Thus, the risk ratio takes into
account the number of seizures observed at a given phase combination, the seizure
rate of a given subject, and the probability of finding a given combination of
phases. These maps were averaged across subjects after alignment to the preferred
circadian and multidien phases (Fig. 6). In addition to this visualization of risk-
ratio maps, we estimated the global effect size with confidence intervals for each
individual, by grouping bins of the map that were in-phase (the ‘risk factor’) or
anti-phase with the preferred angle (±90°) and calculating a risk-ratio between
these two categories (Fig. 5). This was done for circadian and multidien rhythms
independently and for the combination of the two phases (using a union Boolean
operator). Finally, we displayed risk ratios as a Forest plot and computed an effect
size summary metric across subjects using two methods: (i) a simple unweighted
average of the risk ratio and standard error, and (ii) a random effect weighted
average of the risk ratio and standard error (variance in risk-ratio was assumed to
be non-random, Fig. 5)47.
