Adverse  Childhood

 Spanking
 has  indicated

 Introduction
A
 growing
 body
 of
 literature
 has
 examined
 the
 long-term
 impacts
 of
 adverse
 childhood
 experiences
 (ACEs)
 on
 poor
 adult
health
 outcomes.
 The
 adverse
 experiences
 assessed
 in
 the
 original
 ACEs
 study
 included
 child
 maltreatment
 (i.e.,
 physical
abuse,
 emotional
 abuse,
 sexual
 abuse,
 physical
 neglect,
 emotional
 neglect,
 and
 exposure
 to
 mother
 being
 treated
 violently)
and
 household
 challenges
 (i.e.,
 parental
 divorce
 or
 separation,
 parental
 incarceration,
 and
 a
 household
 member
 with
 sub-
stance
 abuse
 problems,
 mental
 illness,
 and/or
 suicide
 attempt).
 Typically
 research
 in
 this
 area
 has
 used
 an
 index
 that
 combines
both
 child
 maltreatment
 ACEs
 and
 ACEs
 related
 to
 household
 challenges
 to
 create
 a
 cumulative
 count
 of
 how
 many
 ACEs
 an
individual
 has
 experienced
 (Dube
 et
 al.,
 2001;
 Dube,
 Felitti,
 Dong,
 Giles,
 &
 Anda,
 2003;
 Felitti
 et
 al.,
 1998).
 ACEs
 are
 common
in
 North
 America,
 with
 a
 majority
 of
 adults
 reporting
 that
 they
 experienced
 at
 least
 one
 ACE
 (52.1%–67.3%),
 two
 or
 more
ACEs
 (25.6%–41.7%),
 and
 even
 as
 many
 as
 four
 or
 more
 ACEs
 (6.2%–16.3%)
 (Afifi
 et
 al.,
 2011;
 Dong
 et
 al.,
 2004;
 Dube
 et
 al.,
2001;
 Dube,
 Anda,
 Felitti,
 Edwards,
 &
 Croft,
 2002;
 Dube,
 Anda,
 Felitti,
 Edwards,
 &
 Williamson
 et
 al.,
 2002;
 Dube,
 Felitti,
 Dong,
Chapman,
 Giles,
 &
 Anda
 et
 al.,
 2003;
 Dube,
 Felitti,
 Dong,
 &
 Giles
 et
 al.,
 2003;
 Felitti
 et
 al.,
 1998).
Although
 these
 studies
 included
 questions
 about
 exposure
 to
 physical
 abuse,
 which
 was
 defined
 as
 pushing,
 grabbing,
shoving,
 slapping,
 as
 well
 as
 hitting
 so
 hard
 to
 leave
 marks
 or
 cause
 injury;
 to
 date,
 spanking
 has
 not
 been
 included
 as
 an
 ACE.
This
 is
 an
 important
 limitation
 because,
 although
 spanking
 is
 common,
 normative,
 and
 legal
 in
 North
 America
 (Clément
 &
Chamberland,
 2014;
 Lee
 et
 al.,
 2014;
 Straus
 &
 Stewart,
 1999;
 Zolotor,
 Robinson,
 Runyan,
 Barr,
 &
 Murphy,
 2011),
 the
 practice
of
 spanking
 as
 a
 form
 of
 discipline
 has
 been
 found
 to
 be
 potentially
 harmful
 (Altschul,
 Lee,
 &
 Gershoff,
 2016;
 American
Academy
 of
 Child
 and
 Adolescent
 Psychiatry,
 2012;
 Gershoff,
 2013;
 Gershoff
 &
 Grogan-Kaylor,
 2016;
 Gershoff,
 2002;
 Lee,
Taylor,
 Altschul,
 &
 Rice,
 2013;
 Wolraich
 et
 al.,
 1998)
 and
 is
 now
 banned
 in
 51
 countries
 or
 areas
 worldwide
 (Global
 Initiative
 to
End
 Corporal
 Punishment
 of
 Children,
 2016).
 Further
 examination
 of
 spanking,
 alongside
 child
 maltreatment
 ACEs,
 also
 will
help
 to
 inform
 the
 United
 Nations
 Sustainable
 Development
 Goals
 (SDG),
 specifically
 the
 goals
 to
 end
 all
 forms
 of
 violence
against
 children
 and
 to
 promote
 well-being
 for
 all
 across
 the
 lifespan
 (United
 Nations,
 2016).
Spanking,
 is
 typically
 defined
 as
 the
 “use
 of
 physical
 force
 with
 the
 intention
 of
 causing
 a
 child
 to
 experience
 pain,
 but
 not
injury,
 for
 the
 purpose
 of
 correcting
 or
 controlling
 the
 child’s
 behavior”
 (Donnelly
 &
 Straus,
 2008;
 p.
 3).
 Reports
 of
 spanking
have
 also
 shown
 an
 association
 with
 increased
 risk
 that
 a
 child
 will
 be
 physically
 abused
 (Gershoff,
 2013;
 Global
 Initiative
to
 End
 Corporal
 Punishment
 of
 Children,
 2016;
 Lee
 et
 al.,
 2013;
 Zolotor,
 Theodore,
 Chang,
 Berkoff,
 &
 Runyan,
 2008).
 Further,
child
 protection
 investigations
 have
 revealed
 a
 relation
 between
 parents’
 attempts
 to
 discipline
 their
 children
 with
 corporal
punishment
 and
 physical
 abuse
 (Durrant,
 Trocmé,
 Fallon
 Barbara,
 Black,
 &
 Knoke,
 2006).
 As
 such,
 it
 is
 likely
 that
 parents
who
 rely
 on
 spanking
 as
 an
 acceptable
 and
 necessary
 approach
 to
 controlling
 children’s
 behavior
 may
 be
 more
 likely
 to
physically
 abuse
 their
 children.
 Spanking
 also
 is
 associated
 with
 risk
 for
 experiencing
 other
 forms
 of
 maltreatment,
 including
psychological
 aggression,
 sexual
 abuse,
 as
 well
 as
 acts
 of
 physical
 and
 emotional
 neglect
 (Lee
 et
 al.,
 2014;
 Taylor,
 Guterman,
Lee,
 &
 Rathouz,
 2009).
 Previous
 research
 has
 indicated
 that
 harsh
 physical
 punishment
 including
 pushing,
 grabbing,
 shoving,
hitting
 or
 slapping
 is
 associated
 with
 increased
 odds
 of
 physical
 abuse,
 sexual
 abuse,
 emotional
 abuse,
 emotional
 neglect,
physical
 neglect,
 and
 exposure
 to
 intimate
 partner
 violence
 with
 the
 greatest
 odds
 found
 between
 harsh
 physical
 punishment
and
 physical
 and
 emotional
 abuse
 (Afifi,
 Mota,
 Sareen,
 &
 MacMillan,
 under
 review).
Child
 maltreatment
 has
 been
 consistently
 associated
 with
 a
 broad
 range
 of
 mental
 health
 problems,
 including
 depression
or
 depressed
 mood
 (e.g.,
 Afifi,
 Brownridge,
 Cox,
 &
 Sareen,
 2006;
 Anda
 et
 al.,
 2002;
 Chapman
 et
 al.,
 2004;
 Schilling,
 Aseltine,
&
 Gore,
 2007),
 personality
 disorders
 (Afifi
 et
 al.,
 2011),
 suicidal
 ideation
 and/or
 attempts
 (e.g.,
 Afifi
 et
 al.,
 2014;
 Enns
 et
 al.,
2006;
 Felitti
 et
 al.,
 1998),
 and
 substance
 use
 in
 adulthood
 (e.g.,
 Afifi,
 Henriksen,
 Asmundson,
 &
 Sareen,
 2012;
 Afifi
 et
 al.,
 2006;
Schilling
 et
 al.,
 2007).
 Similarly,
 numerous
 studies
 over
 the
 past
 20
 years
 have
 also
 found
 spanking
 to
 be
 associated
 with
similar
 mental
 health
 problems
 in
 childhood
 and
 adulthood,
 including
 depression
 or
 depressed
 mood
 (e.g.,
 Fergusson,
 Boden,
&
 Horwood,
 2008;
 MacMillan
 et
 al.,
 1999;
 McLoyd,
 Kaplan,
 Hardaway,
 &
 Wood,
 2007),
 personality
 disorders
 (Lynam,
 Miller,
Vachon,
 Loeber,
 &
 Stouthamer-Loeber,
 2009),
 suicidal
 ideations
 and/or
 attempts
 and
 self-injurious
 behaviour
 (Fergusson
et
 al.,
 2008),
 and
 substance
 use
 (Fergusson
 et
 al.,
 2008;
 Lau
 et
 al.,
 2005).
 However,
 some
 of
 these
 studies
 are
 limited
 by
 not
simultaneously
 accounting
 for
 other
 adverse
 childhood
 experiences.
Importantly,
 there
 are
 no
 studies
 showing
 that
 spanking
 enhances
 children’s
 development
 or
 physical
 or
 mental
 health
(Durrant
 &
 Ensom,
 2012;
 Gershoff
 &
 Grogan-Kaylor,
 2016).
 Given
 that
 both
 spanking
 and
 physical
 abuse
 involve
 the
 use
 of
physical
 force
 and
 the
 infliction
 of
 pain
 and
 are
 linked
 with
 similar
 mental
 health
 outcomes,
 it
 raises
 the
 question
 of
 whether
spanking
 should
 be
 considered
 another
 ACE.
 Previous
 research
 has
 indicated
 that
 ACEs
 can
 be
 grouped
 into
 a
 three
 factor
structures:
 a)
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 factor;
 Sexual
 Abuse
 factor;
 and
 Household
 Challenges
 factor
 (e.g.,
 parental
 substance
use,
 parental
 divorce)
 (Ford
 et
 al.,
 2014).
 Spanking
 may
 be
 functionally
 similar
 to
 the
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 factor
 and
statistically
 factor
 together
 reflecting
 underlying
 processes
 that
 have
 created
 the
 correlations
 among
 them

 As
 well,
 spanking
 may
 have
 similar
 associations
 as
 a
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 factor
 with
 adult
 mental
 health
impairment
 while
 contributing
 to
 additional
 variance
 in
 these
 models
 as
 indicated
 by
 significant
 associations
 over
 and
 above
what
 is
 explained
 by
 a
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 factor.
 However,
 these
 proposition
 has
 never
 been
 tested
 because,
 to
 date,
studies
 with
 ACEs
 have
 not
 included
 spanking.
 To
 determine
 if
 spanking
 should
 be
 considered
 an
 ACE,
 it
 is
 important
 to
ascertain
 whether
 spanking
 adds
 to
 our
 understanding
 of
 the
 relation
 between
 negative
 childhood
 experiences
 and
 adult
mental
 health
 impairment.
 Therefore,
 the
 objectives
 of
 the
 present
 study
 were
 to
 examine:
 1)
 the
 grouping
 or
 factor
 structure
of
 spanking
 with
 physical
 and
 emotional
 abuse;
 and
 2)
 if
 spanking
 has
 both
 similar
 associations
 as
 the
 Physical/Emotional
abuse
 factor
 with
 poor
 adult
 health
 problems
 and
 accounts
 for
 additional
 variance
 in
 the
 models.

 Method
2.1.
 Data
 and
 sample
Data
 for
 this
 cross-sectional
 study
 were
 drawn
 from
 Wave
 II
 of
 the
 CDC-Kaiser
 ACE
 Study
 based
 on
 self-reports
 from
adult
 members
 of
 a
 large
 healthcare
 maintenance
 organization
 in
 southern
 California
 seeking
 routine
 health
 checks
 at
 an
outpatient
 clinic
 (N
 =
 8316
 ages
 19–97
 years;
 response
 rate
 65%)
 (Felitti
 et
 al.,
 1998).
 The
 ACE
 Study
 protocol
 was
 approved
by
 the
 Institutional
 Review
 Boards
 of
 the
 Southern
 California
 Permanente
 Medical
 Group
 (Kaiser
 Permanente),
 the
 Emory
School
 of
 Medicine,
 and
 the
 Office
 of
 Protection
 from
 Research
 Risks,
 National
 Institutes
 of
 Health.
2.2.
 Measurements
2.2.1.
 Spanking.
 Respondents
 were
 asked
 “Sometimes
 parents
 spank
 their
 children
 as
 a
 form
 of
 discipline.
 While
 you
 were
growing
 up
 during
 your
 first
 18
 years
 of
 life
 how
 often
 were
 you
 spanked?”
 Spanking
 was
 coded
 as
 “no”
 if
 the
 respondent
indicated
 that
 he/she
 was
 never
 spanked
 or
 spanked
 only
 once
 or
 twice
 throughout
 childhood;
 spanking
 once
 or
 twice
 was
grouped
 with
 no
 spanking
 because
 some
 parents
 spank
 only
 once
 and
 then
 decide
 never
 to
 spank
 again
 and
 thus
 spanking
is
 not
 a
 regular
 part
 of
 their
 parenting.
 Spanking
 was
 coded
 as
 “yes”
 if
 the
 respondent
 reported
 being
 spanked
 a
 few
 times
per
 year,
 many
 times
 per
 year,
 or
 weekly
 or
 more.
2.2.2.
 Adverse
 childhood
 experiences
 (ACEs).
 Physical
 and
 emotional
 abuse
 were
 assessed
 using
 the
 ACE
 questionnaire
 (Felitti
et
 al.,
 1998),
 which
 included
 items
 from
 the
 Childhood
 Trauma
 Questionnaire
 (Bernstein
 et
 al.,
 1994).
 Respondents
 were
asked
 “while
 growing
 up,
 during
 your
 first
 18
 years
 of
 life,
 how
 often
 did
 a
 parent,
 stepparent,
 or
 adult
 living
 in
 your
 home
do
 the
 following.”
 Physical
 abuse
 included
 two
 questions
 asking
 if
 the
 adult:
 a)
 pushed,
 grabbed,
 shoved,
 slapped
 you
 or
threw
 something
 at
 you
 and
 b)
 hit
 you
 so
 hard
 that
 you
 had
 marks
 or
 were
 injured?
 Emotional
 abuse
 included
 two
 items
asking
 if
 an
 adult:
 a)
 swore
 at
 you,
 insulted
 you,
 or
 put
 you
 down
 and
 b)
 acted
 in
 a
 way
 that
 made
 you
 afraid
 that
 you
might
 be
 physically
 hurt.
 Physical
 and
 emotional
 abuse
 were
 both
 measured
 using
 the
 ordinal
 scale
 of
 never,
 once
 or
 twice,
sometimes,
 often,
 and
 very
 often.
2.2.3.
 Adult
 mental
 health
 impairment.
2.2.3.1.
 Depressed
 affect.
 
Depressed
 affect
 was
 assessed
 using
 the
 following
 item
 from
 the
 Diagnostic
 Interview
 Schedule
(Robins,
 Helzer,
 Croughan,
 &
 Ratcliff,
 1981):
 “In
 the
 past
 year,
 have
 you
 had
 two
 weeks
 or
 more
 during
 which
 you
 felt
 sad,
blue,
 or
 depressed,
 or
 lost
 pleasure
 in
 things
 that
 you
 usually
 cared
 about
 or
 enjoyed?"
2.2.3.2.
 Moderate
 to
 heavy
 drinking.
 Lifetime
 moderate
 to
 heavy
 drinker
 status
 was
 defined
 as
 having
 consumed
 14
 or
 more
drinks
 per
 week
 for
 men
 and
 7
 or
 more
 drinks
 per
 week
 for
 women.
2.2.3.3.

used
 to
 examine
 the
 empirical
 grouping
 of
 the
 spanking
 item
 with
 ACE
 items
 previously
 demonstrated
 to
 be
 indicators
 of
a
 latent
 measure
 of
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 (i.e.,
 the
 factor
 of
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 comprised
 of
 the
 four
 physical
and
 emotional
 abuse
 items)
 (Ford
 et
 al.,
 2014).
 Having
 spanking
 load
 on
 the
 same
 factor
 as
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 would
indicate
 highly
 correlated
 variables
 that
 reflect
 a
 similar
 underlying
 process
 (Tabachnick
 &
 Fidell,
 2013).
 A
 single
 factor
was
 specified
 using
 the
 spanking
 item
 in
 addition
 to
 each
 of
 the
 four
 physical
 and
 emotional
 abuse
 items
 from
 the
 ACE
questionnaire
 as
 indicators
 in
 Mplus
 7.0
 (Muthen
 &
 Muthen,
 2000),
 using
 mean-
 and
 variance-adjusted
 weighted
 least

 (WLSMV).
 Model
 fit
 was
 assessed
 using
 Root

 Error

 Tucker-

 (TLI),
 and
 Comparative

 (CFI)

 to
 indicate

and
 TLI/CFI,
 respectively
 (Bentler,
 1990;
 Browne
 &
 Cudeck,
 1992;
 Hu
 &
 Bentler,
 1999).
 Using
 the
 results
 from
 the
 CFA,
a
 composite
 score
 for
 Physical/Emotional
 factor
 (comprised
 of
 the
 four
 physical
 and
 emotional
 abuse
 items)
 were
 then
computed
 for
 each
 respondent
 in
 the
 sample
 by
 summing
 the
 responses
 for
 each
 of
 the
 items
 comprising
 the
 scale.
 However,
the
 spanking
 item
 was
 excluded
 from
 the
 composite
 score
 in
 this
 analysis
 even
 though
 it
 loaded
 with
 the
 physical
 abuse
 and
emotional
 abuse
 items.
 This
 was
 done
 in
 order
 to
 examine
 the
 contribution
 of
 additional
 variance
 spanking
 may
 add
 in
 the
models
 above
 and
 beyond
 physical
 and
 emotional
 abuse
 in
 the
 subsequent
 analyses.
 As
 such,
 a
 series
 of
 nested
 sequential
adjusted
 logistic
 regression
 models
 were
 estimated
 to
 examine:
 1)
 the
 associations
 among
 spanking
 and
 each
 of
 the
 four
adult
 mental
 health
 impairment
 outcomes
 (Model
 1);
 2)
 the
 associations
 of
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 factor
 (without
 the
inclusion
 of
 the
 spanking
 item)
 with
 the
 four
 adult
 mental
 health
 impairment
 outcomes
 (Model
 2);
 and
 3)
 if
 both
 spanking
and
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 factor
 were
 found
 to
 be
 individually
 associated
 with
 an
 outcome.
 That
 is,
 when
 both
 were
entered
 simultaneously
 into
 the
 same
 model,
 does
 spanking
 remain
 significantly
 associated
 with
 the
 adult
 mental
 health
impairment
 problem
 over
 and
 above
 the
 variance
 accounted
 for
 by
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 (Model
 3)?
 These
 models
 will
help
 us
 to
 understand
 both
 the
 shared
 and
 unique
 variance
 spanking
 and
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 contribute
 to
 the
 models
and
 our
 understanding
 of
 adult
 mental
 health
 problems.
 All
 models
 were
 adjusted
 for
 the
 respondent’s
 age,
 race/ethnicity,
educational
 attainment,
 and
 marital
 status.

 Results
In
 the
 study
 sample,
 54.8%
 of
 respondents
 reported
 being
 spanked.
 Table
 1
 provides
 the
 distribution
 of
 sociodemographic
characteristics
 among
 those
 who
 were
 and
 were
 not
 spanked.
 Men
 compared
 to
 women
 were
 more
 likely
 to
 experience
spanking
 in
 childhood.
 Compared
 to
 White
 respondents,
 Black
 respondents
 and
 respondents
 indicating
 other
 ethnicity
 were
more
 likely
 to
 report
 being
 spanked,
 while
 spanking
 was
 less
 likely
 among
 Asian
 respondents.
 Spanking
 was
 prevalent
 across
all
 education
 levels.
 A
 history
 of
 childhood
 spanking
 was
 not
 associated
 with
 marital
 status
 in
 adulthood.

 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 (without
 the
 inclusion
 of
 the
 spanking
 item)
 was
 associated
 with
 adult
 impairment
across
 the
 four
 mental
 health
 outcomes
 examined:
 depressed
 affect,
 suicide
 attempts,
 moderate
 to
 heavy
 drinking,
 and
street
 drug
 use
 after
 adjusting
 for
 sociodemographic
 characteristics
 (Model
 2).
 Given
 that
 both
 a
 history
 of
 spanking
 and
of
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 were
 found
 to
 be
 individually
 associated
 with
 adult
 mental
 health
 problems,
 we
 next
 tested
whether
 spanking
 maintained
 its
 association
 with
 these
 outcomes
 when
 adjusting
 for
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 factor
 and
sociodemographic
 characteristics.
 Spanking
 remained
 significantly
 associated
 with
 suicide
 attempts,
 moderate
 to
 heavy
drinking,
 and
 street
 drug
 use
 and
 accounted
 for
 additional
 variance
 in
 the
 model
 above
 and
 beyond
 Physical/Emotional
abuse
 (Model
 3).
 Further,
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 was
 also
 found
 to
 remain
 statistically
 significant
 in
 these
 fully
 adjusted
model.
 The
 result
 from
 the
 nested
 sequential
 models
 indicate
 that
 spanking
 and
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 have
 overlapping
or
 shared
 variance,
 but
 also
 both
 contribute
 to
 additional
 unique
 variance
 indicating
 statistically
 improved
 models
 when
both
 spanking
 and
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 are
 included.

 Discussion
This
 study
 compared
 the
 extent
 to
 which
 a
 childhood
 history
 of
 spanking
 and
 a
 childhood
 history
 of
 physical
 and
 emo-
tional
 abuse
 are
 linked
 with
 mental
 health
 impairments
 in
 adulthood.
 The
 first
 main
 finding
 is
 that
 spanking
 loaded
 on
 the
same
 factor
 as
 the
 physical
 and
 emotional
 abuse
 items
 indicated
 these
 experiences
 are
 highly
 correlated
 and
 reflect
 a
 similar
underlying
 process.
 Second,
 a
 childhood
 history
 of

erate
 to
 heavy
 drinking,
 and
 street
 drug
 use
 in
 adulthood,
 over
 and
 above
 their
 childhood
 experiences
 of
 Physical/Emotional
abuse
 indicating
 that
 our
 understanding
 of
 adult
 mental
 health
 impairments
 is
 better
 when
 we  consider
 the
 experience
 of
spanking
 along
 with
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse.
These
 findings
 are
 consistent
 with
 the
 previous
 work
 indicating
 that
 spanking
 and
 physical
 abuse
 are
 on
 a
 continuum
 of
violence
 against
 children
 (Gelles
 &
 Straus,
 1988)
 and
 that
 there
 is
 a
 strong
 relationship
 between
 harsh
 physical
 punishment
and
 physical
 as
 well
 as
 emotional
 abuse
 (Afifi
 et
 al.,
 under
 review;
 Taylor
 et
 al.,
 2009).
 Additionally,
 the
 link
 between
 spanking
and
 these
 other
 child
 maltreatment
 ACEs
 suggests
 that
 preventing
 the
 use
 of
 spanking
 may
 correspond
 with
 reductions
 in
child
 maltreatment,
 which
 help
 to
 inform
 efforts
 for
 the
 United
 Nations
 SDG
 of
 ending
 all
 violence
 against
 children
 (United
Nations,
 2016).
Importantly,
 spanking
 empirically
 loaded
 with
 physical
 and
 emotional
 abuse
 items
 indicating
 similar
 underlying
 con-
struct.
 Also,
 spanking
 remained
 associated
 with
 increased
 odds
 of
 adult
 mental
 and
 behavioral
 health
 impairment
 including
suicide
 attempts,
 moderate
 to
 heavy
 drinking,
 and
 street
 drug
 use
 even
 after
 accounting
 for
 the
 experiences
 of
 Physi-
cal/Emotional
 abuse.
 Taken
 together,
 these
 findings
 show
 that
 spanking
 has
 shared
 variance
 with
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse,
but
 also
 accounts
 for
 additional
 unique
 variance
 for
 understanding
 the
 relationships
 with
 suicide
 attempts,
 moderate
 and
heavy
 drinking,
 and
 street
 drug
 use.
 Therefore,
 including
 a
 spanking
 with
 Physical/Emotion
 abuse
 experiences
 would
 increase
our
 understanding
 of
 these
 adult
 mental
 health
 problems.
Spanking
 was
 associated
 with
 depressed
 affect,
 but
 inconsistent
 with
 previous
 depression
 research,
 (Fergusson
 et
 al.,
2008;
 MacMillan
 et
 al.,
 1999;
 Taillieu
 &
 Brownridge,
 2013)
 when
 adjusting
 for
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 this
 finding
 was
no
 longer
 statistically
 significant.
 It
 is
 important
 to
 note
 that
 depressed
 affect
 is
 not
 the
 same
 as
 a
 diagnosis
 of
 depression;
hence
 any
 association
 or
 lack
 thereof
 between
 spanking
 and
 major
 depression
 cannot
 be
 determined
 using
 these
 data.
On
 the
 basis
 of
 the
 CFA
 findings
 and
 the
 associations
 of
 spanking
 and
 suicide
 attempts,
 moderate
 to
 heavy
 drinking,
 and
street
 drug
 use
 in
 adulthood,
 spanking
 should
 be
 considered
 as
 an
 additional
 childhood
 adversity
 that
 has
 the
 potential
 to
negatively
 affect
 mental
 health
 outcomes.
 Spanking
 and
 child
 physical
 abuse
 have
 been
 thought
 to
 exist
 along
 a
 continuum
 of
violence
 against
 children
 rather
 than
 as
 separate
 constructs
 (Coontz
 &
 Martin,
 1988;
 Dussich
 &
 Maekoya,
 2007;
 Österman,
Björkqvist,
 &
 Wahlbeck,
 2014),
 and
 the
 findings
 from
 this
 study
 provide
 evidence
 for
 such
 a
 continuum.
 In
 our
 sample,
spanking
 was
 found
 to
 have
 similarities
 with
 physical
 and
 emotional
 abuse
 as
 indicating
 by
 significantly
 loading
 together
 on
one
 statistical
 factor.
 In
 addition,
 spanking
 was
 related
 to
 similar
 poor
 outcomes
 as
 the
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 factor
 and
the
 relationships
 between
 spanking
 and
 suicide
 attempts,
 moderate
 to
 heavy
 drinking,
 and
 street
 drug
 use
 remained
 above
and
 beyond
 the
 effects
 of
 also
 experiencing
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse.
 This
 means
 that
 in
 addition
 to
 the
 shared
 variance
 of
spanking
 and
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 in
 these
 models,
 spanking
 also
 accounts
 for
 additional
 and
 unique
 variance
 in
 these
models.
 Therefore,
 the
 inclusion
 of
 spanking
 along
 with
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 in
 these
 models
 furthers
 our
 understanding
of
 the
 relationships
 with
 poor
 adult
 mental
 health
 impairment.
 The
 current
 findings
 adds
 to
 the
 evidence
 that
 spanking
 is
potentially
 harmful
 and
 should
 be
 considered
 an
 ACE.
Despite
 the
 strengthens
 of
 the
 present
 study,
 particularly
 the
 inclusion
 of
 spanking
 with
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse,
four
 mental
 health
 outcomes,
 and
 a
 large
 sample,
 it
 also
 has
 several
 limitations.
 First,
 the
 data
 are
 cross-sectional
 and
retrospective,
 precluding
 any
 findings
 about
 temporal
 or
 causal
 relationships.
 However,
 evidence
 suggests
 that
 retrospective
recall
 of
 adverse
 events
 in
 survey
 data
 can
 be
 valid
 and
 reliable
 (Hardt,
 Sidor,
 Bracko,
 &
 Egle,
 2006;
 Hardt,
 Vellaisamy,
 &
Schoon,
 2010;
 Hardt
 &
 Rutter,
 2004).
 Second,
 both
 spanking
 exposure
 and
 mental
 health
 outcomes
 were
 based
 upon
 single
self-report
 and
 retrospective
 items.
 For
 example,
 depressive
 affect
 was
 assessed
 using
 one
 item
 rather
 than
 a
 series
 of
questions
 necessary
 to
 generate
 an
 algorithm
 of
 depression.
 More
 comprehensive
 assessment
 of
 mental
 health
 conditions
using
 several
 items,
 for
 example,
 in
 the
 context
 of
 diagnostic
 assessments
 would
 have
 been
 preferable.
 Similarly,
 information
on
 spanking
 was
 limited.
 Third,
 the
 data
 were
 collected
 in
 1997
 (Felitti
 et
 al.,
 1998)
 making
 the
 data
 approximately
 20
 years
old.
 Nevertheless,
 these
 data
 are
 unique
 in
 that
 they
 are
 of
 high
 quality
 as
 they
 were
 sampled
 from
 a
 large
 HMO,
 have
 a
 large
sample
 size
 and
 good
 response
 rate,
 and
 assess
 several
 ACEs
 along
 with
 spanking
 and
 poor
 mental
 health
 outcomes.
 These
data
 provide
 a
 unique
 opportunity
 to
 address
 important
 knowledge
 gaps.
 In
 addition,
 the
 use
 of
 spanking
 and
 the
 debate
regarding
 the
 safety
 of
 spanking
 continues
 today,
 making
 these
 data
 topical
 and
 of
 current
 interest.
 Our
 focus
 has
 been
 on
the
 relationships
 among
 spanking
 and
 exposures
 previously
 identified
 as
 ACEs,
 as
 well
 as
 the
 association
 between
 spanking
and
 poor
 mental
 health
 outcomes
 −
 independent
 of
 the
 era
 within
 which
 the
 spanking
 occurred.
In
 summary,
 these
 findings
 provide
 strong
 support
 that
 spanking
 can
 be
 considered
 yet
 another
 form
 of
 early
 adversity,
based
 on
 the
 loading
 on
 the
 same
 factor
 structure
 with
 physical
 and
 emotional
 abuse
 items
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 spanking
 was
significantly
 related
 to
 adult
 health
 impairments
 above
 and
 beyond
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse.
 The
 relationship
 between
reports
 of
 being
 spanked
 in
 childhood
 and
 mental
 and
 behavioral
 health
 impairment
 in
 adulthood
 are
 similar
 in
 direction
 to
the
 associations
 between
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 and
 adult
 suicide
 attempts,
 moderate
 to
 heavy
 drinking,
 and
 street
 drug
use.
 Therefore,
 these
 results
 provide
 strong
 support
 for
 consideration
 of
 spanking
 as
 an
 ACE.
 Researchers
 have
 noted
 that
expanding
 the
 types
 of
 ACEs
 included
 in
 research
 could
 increase
 our
 understanding
 of
 poor
 outcomes
 and
 strengthen
 ACE
studies
 (Finkelhor,
 Shattuck,
 Turner,
 &
 Hamby,
 2013).
 The
 association
 between
 spanking
 and
 mental
 health
 outcomes
 has
been
 examined
 in
 prior
 studies
 (Durrant
 &
 Ensom,
 2012;
 Gershoff
 &
 Grogan-Kaylor,
 2016;
 Gershoff,
 2002),
 but
 the
 current
study
 advances
 knowledge
 with
 the
 use
 of
 a
 large
 sample,
 and
 the
 ability
 to
 examine
 the
 factor
 structure
 of
 spanking,
 physical
abuse,
 and
 emotional
 abuse,
 and
 the
 relationships
 between
 spanking
 and
 adult
 mental
 health
 impairment
 while
 adjusting
for
 Physical/Emotional
 abuse
 factor
 and
 sociodemographic
 characteristics.

Despite
 the
 high
 prevalence
 of
 spanking
 and
 continued
 support
 for
 its
 use
 among
 some
 sectors
 in
 the
 US,
 the
 use
 of
spanking
 as
 a
 form
 of
 child
 discipline
 has
 been
 heavily
 scrutinized
 over
 the
 past
 several
 years.
 The
 findings
 from
 this
 study
along
 with
 the
 preponderance
 of
 research
 evidence
 (Afifi,
 Mota,
 Dasiewicz,
 MacMillan,
 &
 Sareen,
 2012;
 Afifi
 et
 al.,
 2006;
Altschul
 et
 al.,
 2016;
 Durrant
 &
 Ensom,
 2012;
 Gershoff
 &
 Grogan-Kaylor,
 2016;
 Gershoff,
 2002)
 indicate
 that
 spanking
 is
associated
 with
 an
 increased
 likelihood
 of
 important
 mental
 health
 and
 behavioral
 problems
 in
 adulthood.
 For
 this
 reason,
it
 is
 important
 to
 help
 parents
 avoid
 physical
 punishment
 and
 instead
 use
 safe
 and
 effective
 ways
 to
 discipline
 and
 guide
their
 children
 (see
 for
 example
 Chavis
 et
 al.,
 2013;
 Durrant,
 2007;
 Sanders,
 2008).
One
 implication
 of
 this
 work
 is
 that
 it
 reminds
 us
 that
 it
 is
 important
 to
 prevent
 not
 just
 child
 maltreatment,
 but
 also
 harsh
parenting
 before
 it
 occurs.
 This
 can
 be
 achieved
 by
 promoting
 evidence-based
 parenting
 programs
 and
 policies
 designed
 to
prevent
 early
 adversities,
 and
 associated
 risk
 factors.
 Prevention
 should
 be
 a
 critical
 direction
 for
 public
 health
 initiatives
to
 take.
 This
 includes
 a
 need
 to
 promote
 positive
 parenting
 through
 education
 and
 legislation
 to
 reduce
 the
 use
 of
 corporal
punishment,
 which
 includes
 spanking
 (Fortson,
 Klevens,
 Merrick,
 Gilbert
 &
 Alexander,
 2016).
 Assuring
 safe,
 stable,
 nurturing
relationships
 and
 environments
 for
 all
 children
 is
 essential
 for
 healthy
 growth
 and
 development,
 effective
 parenting
 in
 the
future
 parents,
 safer
 communities,
 and
 stronger
 economies
 (The
 Centers
 for
 Disease
 Control
 and
 Prevention,
 2014;
 Fortson
et
 al.,
 2016).
