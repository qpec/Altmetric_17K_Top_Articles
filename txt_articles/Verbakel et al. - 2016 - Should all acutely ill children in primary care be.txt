Abstract
Background: Point-of-care blood C-reactive protein (CRP) testing has diagnostic value in helping clinicians rule out
the possibility of serious infection. We investigated whether it should be offered to all acutely ill children in primary
care or restricted to those identified as at risk on clinical assessment.
Methods: Cluster randomised controlled trial involving acutely ill children presenting to 133 general practitioners
(GPs) at 78 GP practices in Belgium. Practices were randomised to undertake point-of-care CRP testing in all
children (1730 episodes) or restricted to children identified as at clinical risk (1417 episodes). Clinical risk was
assessed by a validated clinical decision rule (presence of one of breathlessness, temperature ≥ 40 °C, diarrhoea
and age 12–30 months, or clinician concern). The main trial outcome was hospital admission with serious infection
within 5 days. No specific guidance was given to GPs on interpreting CRP levels but diagnostic performance is
reported at 5, 20, 80 and 200 mg/L.
Results: Restricting CRP testing to those identified as at clinical risk substantially reduced the number of children
tested by 79.9 % (95 % CI, 77.8–82.0 %). There was no significant difference between arms in the number of
children with serious infection who were referred to hospital immediately (0.16 % vs. 0.14 %, P = 0.88). Only one
child with a CRP < 5 mg/L had an illness requiring admission (a child with viral gastroenteritis admitted for
rehydration). However, of the 80 children referred to hospital to rule out serious infection, 24 (30.7 %, 95 % CI,
19.6–45.6 %) had a CRP < 5 mg/L.
Conclusions: CRP testing should be restricted to children at higher risk after clinical assessment. A CRP < 5 mg/L rules
out serious infection and could be used by GPs to avoid unnecessary hospital referrals.

Background
The care for acutely ill children has traditionally been a
primary care responsibility [1], but increasing numbers
are being seen in secondary care. There has been a 40 %
increase in the number of children presenting to the
emergency department over the last decade, 14 % of
whom present with febrile illness [2]. Urgent hospital
admission rates have increased by 28 % in the same
period, mostly for acute infections [3], with 23 per 1000
children admitted annually for a condition that could be
managed in the community [3, 4].
In contrast, serious infections have become rare and
are now estimated to constitute < 1 % of childhood
infections presenting to primary care [5]. Pneumonia
represents four-fifths of all cases, followed by urinary
tract infections, and now very few cases of sepsis,

 meningitis, or osteomyelitis [6–8], which, although rare,
their prompt recognition is essential to avoid complica-
tions or death [9]. This is challenging in primary care
because the clinical presentations are highly non-
specific, especially in the early stages of illness. Only
one clinical decision rule has been developed for pri-
mary care, with a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity
of 81 % [8]. Although it can be used to rule out serious
infections safely, it also results in approximately 20 %
of acutely ill children being classified as at higher risk
for a serious infection.
Introducing better diagnostic tests might strengthen
the primary care management of acutely ill children. In-
flammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP)
and procalcitonin can assist in diagnosing serious infec-
tions in hospital settings [10]. Up until now, such blood
tests play only a marginal role in primary care, because
the result comes back from the laboratory too late to
influence clinical decision-making [7]. Point-of-care
tests that perform a CRP test within 4 minutes have
now become available [11, 12].
In this study, we aimed to assess whether performing
point-of-care CRP testing should be done in all children
presenting with acute infection in primary care or only
in those deemed at high-risk of serious illness after ini-
tial clinical assessment. We also aimed to investigate
how CRP results should be interpreted; specifically,
whether a low CRP level can rule out infection and the
consequent need for hospital referral.
Methods
We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial
comparing CRP testing in all children with clinically-
guided
CRP
testing.
Practices
were
randomised to
undertake point-of-care CRP testing in all children or
only children assessed as being at higher risk by a vali-
dated clinical decision rule.
Children aged 1 month to 16 years presenting with an
acute illness for a maximum of 5 days were recruited
consecutively from February 15, 2013, to February 28,
2014, in 78 general practices across Flanders, involving
133 general practitioners (GPs). Children were excluded
if the acute illness was caused by purely traumatic or
neurological conditions, intoxication, a psychiatric prob-
lem, or an exacerbation of a known chronic condition.
When the same child was recruited twice within 5 days,
we considered the second registration to be part of the
same illness episode and excluded the second registra-
tion from the analyses. If a physician recruited fewer
than five children over the 1-year study period, consecu-
tive inclusion was assumed to be violated, leading to the
exclusion of that physician from the analysis.
In the “CRP for all” group, each child had a CRP test. In
the “CRP only if at clinical risk” group, CRP testing was
dependent on the presence of at least one of the following
clinical features: breathlessness, body temperature of at
least 40 °C, diarrhoea in children 12–30 months of age, and
clinician concern [6]. “Breathlessness” was defined as diffi-
cult or laboured breathing. “Body temperature” was defined
as the highest body temperature measured during the ill-
ness episode by the parents or the physician according to
their usual practice. Before analysis, 0.5 °C was added to
temperatures measured under the axilla or with a tympanic
thermometer [13, 14]. “Diarrhoea” was defined as loose or
watery stools, increased in frequency and volume [15].
“Clinician concern” was defined as a subjective feeling of
the physician that something was out of the ordinary.
We used the Afinion™ CRP Test Cartridge, which has
a measuring range for CRP of 5–200 mg/L [12] and re-
quires 1.5 μL of blood obtained by finger prick, provid-
ing a result within 4 minutes. We trained all physicians
to perform the CRP test. Internal quality control was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Randomisation was performed at the practice level to
avoid contamination and stratified by practice type (solo,
duo, group) before randomisation. The intervention-
specific protocols were briefed during a face-to-face
meeting at each practice, differing primarily in the indi-
cation to test for CRP.
The primary outcome of the study was hospital admis-
sion (> 24 hours) for a serious infection within 5 days
after initial presentation. Hospital admission was verified
by a search of the electronic medical records of all hos-
pitals in the practices’ catchment area, an interview with
each participating GP and a diary completed by parents.
Serious infections were defined as:
– sepsis (including bacteraemia): pathogenic bacteria
isolated from blood culture
– meningitis: pleocytosis or identification of bacteria
or a virus in cerebrospinal fluid
– appendicitis: histology
– pneumonia: infiltrate on chest X-ray
– osteomyelitis: pathogens from bone aspirate or a
MRI or bone scan suggestive for osteomyelitis
– cellulitis: acute suppurative inflammation of the
subcutaneous tissues
– bacterial gastroenteritis: pathogen isolated from
stool culture
– complicated urinary tract infection: > 105/mL
pathogens of a single species isolated from urine
culture and systemic effects such as fever
In cases where no definitive adjudication could be
made based on the above criteria, an adjudication com-
mittee, consisting of clinicians with expertise in acute
paediatric care, assigned outcome by consensus, using
all available information.

 Secondary outcomes were referrals (immediate or de-
layed) to secondary care (hospital-based paediatricians)
and the ordering of additional testing (including blood
and urine tests, and imaging) at the initial presentation
as recorded by the GP.
Sample size calculation was described previously [8],
and is based on the assumptions that prevalence would
be 0.8 % and sensitivity and specificity of CRP would be
75 %, as found in a recent meta-analysis, using bivariate
random effects meta-analysis across a range of CRP cut-
off values [10]. Differences in baseline characteristics
and clinical features were analysed through χ2 testing
and nonparametric equality-of-medians testing to assess
potential recruitment bias. We calculated accuracy of
CRP in both groups for the following pre-determined
thresholds: 5 and 200 mg/L which are the lower and
upper limit of the point-of-care CRP test, and 20 and
80 mg/L which have been identified as ‘ruling out’ and
‘ruling in’ thresholds, respectively, in secondary care
[10]. We examined whether time from onset of fever (in
days) influenced the level of CRP using non-parametric
equality-of-medians tests [16]. The 4.2 % missing values
for CRP in those patients that should have had a CRP
test were assigned to either side of the optimal split for
this continuous predictor, defined as the split resulting
in the smallest P value through χ2 testing for the differ-
ence between both sides of the split [17].
To test whether there were any differences in timely
diagnosis, referrals to secondary care or additional
testing between the two groups, we conducted a
mixed-effects logistic regression analysis to account
for the clustering at practice level, and other potential
interaction terms, such as the child’s age, using the
xtmelogit function in Stata [18]. All analyses were per-
formed with Stata software (version 11.2; Stata Corp.,
USA), and JMP Statistical Discovery (version Pro
12.1.0; SAS Institute Inc., USA).
Results
The 3147 illness episodes occurred in 2773 children be-
tween February 15, 2013, and February 28, 2014 (Fig. 1).
The children’s median age was 3.2 years (interquartile
range 1.5–6.9) and 1659 were male (52.7 %). Table 1
shows that the randomisation arms were well balanced
in terms of sex and the presenting features of the illness,
although there was a small imbalance in age (median

 age 3.6 in the CRP for all arm versus 2.7 years in the
CRP if at clinical risk arm).
Impact of testing strategy on clinical management
Table 2 shows that restricting CRP testing to children at
clinical risk (because of breathlessness, temperature ≥ 40 °C,
diarrhoea and age 12–30 months, or clinician concern)
substantially reduced the number of children tested to
285/1417 (20.1 %, 95 % CI, 18.0–22.2 %). All children
with serious infection had one of the at-risk features
sought by the clinical decision rule and thus all re-
ceived CRP testing. Although fewer children were
referred to hospital in the restricted testing arm (2.1 %
vs. 2.9 %), the difference lacks statistical significance (P =
0.15). Similarly, the reduction in the number of chil-
dren with serious infection whose admission was de-
layed (> 24 hours) in the restricted testing arm (0.14 %
vs. 0.29 %) was also non-significant.
Diagnostic performance of CRP
Restricting CRP testing to those identified as at clinical
risk increased the median CRP level of the children
tested from 7 mg/L (IQR: 5–23 mg/L) to 11 mg/L (IQR:
5–30 mg/L). Time from onset of fever did not influence
the median point-of-care CRP level (P > 0.06).
The impact on diagnostic performance of CRP is
shown in Table 3. The small number of cases of serious
infection means that the confidence intervals around the
number of missed cases are wide, with no indication of a
difference between randomisation arms. However, at a
CRP threshold of 5 mg/L, no cases of serious infection
were missed in either arm. The number of false alarms
expressed was also similar in both arms, irrespective of
the threshold applied. If the 5 mg/L threshold was
adopted as a criterion for hospital referral, over half
(59.2 % overall) of the children tested with CRP would
be referred. Of these children, 1 in 40 in the restricted
testing arm would have serious infection (positive pre-
dictive value: 2.4 %). If all children were tested and those
with a CRP level ≥ 5 mg/L referred, then the positive
predictive value would be even lower (0.8 %) and only 1
in 130 children referred would have a serious infection.
Children referred to hospital with normal CRP
Twenty-four children were referred to hospital with a
low CRP level (< 5 mg/L). The clinical presentation and
stated reasons for referral are shown in Table 4. In 17
cases (70.8 %), the referral was made to rule out serious
infection. In only one of these cases was the child admit-
ted – a case of viral gastroenteritis where the child was
admitted because of dehydration.

 Discussion
Main findings
In primary care, CRP testing can be restricted to children
at higher risk of serious infection after clinical assessment.
At a threshold of 5 mg/L, CRP still has limited diagnostic
value in ruling in serious infection (at most, 1 in 40
children will have serious infection) but it does rule out
serious infection and the need for hospital referral.
Strengths and limitations
This trial was performed in a large number of practices
involving 133 general practitioners and 3147 children.

 The results therefore reflect a real-life implementation
of point-of-care CRP testing. Although blinding is not
possible in cluster randomised controlled trials, we
believe the verification of our target condition is robust
and not influenced by the interventions by using a com-
bination of objective criteria and independent adjudica-
tors. We also think that work-up bias in primary care is
unlikely to have had a major impact on our assessment
of diagnostic performance because the diagnosis of ser-
ious infection was based on hospital assessment [19].
We were not able to provide physicians with instructions
on how to deal with the CRP result because there were
no studies available in primary care to underpin this ad-
vice. This could explain the lack of any effect of CRP
tests on additional testing or referrals; earlier studies on
CRP for antibiotic prescribing in adults have shown that in-
structions are pivotal for changing physician prescribing be-
haviour [20]. The trial did not include a no CRP-testing arm
and clinical assessment of all children was guided by a vali-
dated clinical decision rule. This means that we could not
report the effect of CRP testing compared to routine clinical
care. It also means that the advantages we report from limit-
ing CRP testing to children at risk will be achieved only if
the quality of risk assessment is comparable to that imple-
mented in the trial. Given the simplicity of the decision rule
used, this should be achievable in most clinical settings.
Comparison with existing literature
A systematic review based on studies from hospital settings
suggested that CRP levels < 20 mg/L provided the best rule
out value for serious infections in children [10]. We applied
a lower threshold in a primary care setting because children
are presenting at an earlier stage of their illness (i.e. CRP
levels in children with evolving serious infection are likely
to be lower than when they arrive in hospital) [21].
Most studies on the use of CRP in primary care have
focused on antibiotic prescribing in adult patients; a
cluster randomised controlled trial has shown that GP’s
use of point-of-care testing for CRP significantly reduced
antibiotic prescribing if combined with enhanced com-
munication skills [22]. Data from a multinational rando-
mised controlled trial in adults suggested that CRP can
be viewed as a tool to decrease diagnostic uncertainty
and reassure patients in primary care [23], concluding
that addition of CRP at > 30 mg/L improves diagnostic
accuracy of a clinical decision rule to predict pneumonia
in patients with acute cough [24].
Implications
Our results support the implementation of clinically
guided CRP testing to help rule out serious infection
and the need for hospital admission. To detect one child
with a serious infection, the clinical decision rule would
flag 57 children as potentially having a serious infection.
A CRP test in these children allows a serious infection
to be excluded in a further 22, which means fewer would
have to be referred or receive additional testing. This will
strengthen the primary care assessment of acutely ill chil-
dren, assisting GPs in identifying children with a serious
infection without swamping secondary care services. By
supporting clinical decision-making, it empowers clini-
cians to safely manage children in ambulatory care, as pri-
oritized by the NHS Five Year Forward View and the
Future Hospital Commission [25, 26]. In clinical practice,
the implementation of our findings should always allow
for clinical judgment, especially when diagnostic uncertainty
remains. In such cases, appropriate safety netting strategies
(e.g. re-consultation, telephone follow-up, explicating alarm
signs) [27, 28] should be in place. Further research should
focus on the implementation of this validated clinical assess-
ment in combination with CRP testing and evaluate the
cost-effectiveness of the diagnostic strategy overall.
Conclusions
CRP testing in primary care should be restricted to
children at higher risk after clinical assessment. A CRP
< 5 mg/L rules out serious infection and could be used
by GPs to avoid unnecessary hospital referrals.
