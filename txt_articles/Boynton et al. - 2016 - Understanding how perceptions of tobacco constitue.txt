Abstract
Background: The passage of the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act has necessitated the
execution of timely, innovative, and policy-relevant tobacco control research to inform Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) regulatory and messaging efforts. With recent dramatic changes to tobacco product
availability and patterns of use, nationally representative data on tobacco-related perceptions and behaviors are
vital, especially for vulnerable populations.
Methods: The UNC Center for Regulatory Research on Tobacco Communication conducted a telephone survey
with a national sample of adults ages 18 and older living in the United States (U.S.). The survey assessed regulatory
relevant factors such as tobacco product use, tobacco constituent perceptions, and tobacco regulatory agency
credibility. The study oversampled high smoking/low income areas as well as cell phone numbers to ensure
adequate representation among smokers and young adults, respectively. Coverage extended to approximately
98 % of U.S. households.
Results: The final dataset (N = 5,014) generated weighted estimates that were largely comparable to other national
demographic and tobacco use estimates. Results revealed that over one quarter of U.S. adults, and over one third
of smokers, reported having looked for information about tobacco constituents in cigarette smoke; however, the
vast majority was unaware of what constituents might actually be present. Although only a minority of people
reported trust in the federal government, two thirds felt that the FDA can effectively regulate tobacco products.
Conclusions: As the FDA continues their regulatory and messaging activities, they should expand both the breadth
and availability of constituent-related information, targeting these efforts to reach all segments of the U.S.
population, especially those disproportionately vulnerable to tobacco product use and its associated negative
health outcomes.

 Background
Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death and
disease in the United States (U.S.). Morbidity from
smoking-related causes is estimated at more than 480,000
deaths per year, which account for 1 out of 5 deaths in the
U.S. [1] Cigarettes, the most commonly used tobacco
product by adults, have been causally linked with numer-
ous negative health outcomes, including multiple types of
cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory ailments, and
infection [2]. Although the underlying causes are not
wholly clear, members of certain stigmatized and vulner-
able groups in the U.S., such as those living in poverty and
sexual minorities, are disproportionately affected by these
negative tobacco-related consequences [3–5]. One of the
major reasons cigarettes are harmful to health is the pres-
ence of myriad harmful and potentially harmful constitu-
ents in cigarette smoke, many of which are known
toxicants or carcinogens [6].
Due to local, state, and national education and policy
efforts, cigarette smoking has precipitously decreased
from over 42 % of the adult population in 1965–17 % in
2014 [7, 8]. In recent years, declines in cigarette smoking
have been somewhat offset by increases in use of non-
cigarette tobacco products (NCTPs), with the greatest
uptake primarily observed for adolescents and young
adults [9, 10]. Some NCTPs, such as cigars, have long
been available to the public and are a known health
hazard. [11] Other products, such as electronic vaping
devices, are relatively novel, and as a result have un-
known consequences for public health [12]. A grow-
ing body of evidence is finding that, like cigarettes,
many NCTPs contain harmful and potentially harmful
constituents [11, 13, 14]. Considering the substantial
health harms of cigarette and NCTP use, more re-
search is needed to inform effective tobacco regula-
tory and communication efforts.
Tobacco policy and communication
In 2009, the landmark passage of the Family Smok-
ing Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA)
granted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
the power to regulate tobacco products (Public Law
111–31). Since the passage of the FSPTCA, the FDA
has enacted and enforced multiple regulations re-
lated to the marketing, manufacturing, and distribu-
tion of cigarettes, certain cigarette-related products,
and smokeless tobacco. [15] On May 5, 2016 the
FDA expanded their regulatory authority to include
additional tobacco products, including electronic cig-
arettes, hookah, and cigars [16, 17]. As part of their
tobacco control efforts, the FDA has implemented
education campaigns intended to increase the pub-
lic’s awareness of the potential health harms of to-
bacco product uptake and use [18].
Many of the tobacco regulatory and education activities
performed by the FDA include messaging and communica-
tion elements. For example, Sections 904(d) and (e) of the
FSPTCA requires the FDA to publish a list of harmful and
potentially harmful constituents for each tobacco product,
by quantity within each brand and subbrand, in a format
that is both understandable and not misleading [19]. Prior
research using an online convenience sample of U.S. adults
found that although a few tobacco product constituents
were familiar to the public (e.g., nicotine, carbon monox-
ide), the majority of constituents, such as acrolein and
tobacco-specific nitrosamines, were generally unknown
[20]. Recent qualitative research has not only replicated the
finding that the public is largely unaware of the presence of
the majority of tobacco constituents in tobacco product
smoke or aerosol, but when presented with such informa-
tion people would often infer meaning and potential harms
by
relating
constituent
names
to
similar-sounding
words (e.g., acetaldehyde sounds similar to acetamino-
phen) [21, 22]. Given that so many constituent names are
foreign to the average person, additional research exploring
the public’s awareness and interest in tobacco constituents
is needed to inform whether and how the FDA might best
communicate constituent-related information [23].
With the FDA now serving in a pivotal role of com-
municating the potential harms of tobacco product use,
it is essential to understand how both tobacco product
users and non-users perceive the credibility of the FDA
and U.S. government. Given the tobacco industry’s docu-
mented targeting of adolescents and other vulnerable
groups with potent marketing campaigns [24–26], it is
also incumbent upon the FDA to develop and imple-
ment messaging optimized to effectively communicate
the risks of tobacco use to these populations. Notably, a
number of groups most affected by tobacco use and its
associated health outcomes have also historically ex-
perienced mistreatment by government organizations;
examples include individuals with lower levels of educa-
tion and health literacy, those living in poverty, and sex-
ual minorities [27–30]. Effective risk messaging and
product labeling from credible information sources will
help ensure that the public, especially vulnerable po-
pulations, adequately understand the risks of
both
tobacco product use and the presence of harmful and
potentially harmful constituents.
The current study
In order to build a base of policy relevant tobacco-re-
lated research, the FDA, in partnership with the National
Institutes of Health, recently funded 14 Tobacco Centers of
Regulatory Science (TCORS). As part of this large research
effort, our TCORS Center for Regulatory Research on To-
bacco Communication (CRRTC) conducted a nationally-
representative phone survey of U.S. adults. The current
Boynton et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:516 
Page 2 of 13
 paper reports the methods and sample characteristics from
this national phone survey. We compare our demographic
and tobacco use estimates to other validated national esti-
mates in order to assess whether our weighted sample is
nationally representative. Additionally, we examine the
responses for several of the constituent and credibility-
related items, discussing the implications of the overall esti-
mates as well as differences observed for certain key groups.
Taken together the findings lay a foundation for future
empirical work that directly informs how perceptions of
tobacco constituents and the FDA relate to effective and
credible tobacco risk messaging.
Method
Survey measures
Development
Using an iterative survey question generation and revision
procedure coordinated among three semi-independent
projects, the team developed an instrument assessing
tobacco-related product use and perceptions, demo-
graphic characteristics, general health, and government
organization-related credibility and messaging percep-
tions. Cognitive interviewing was used at various stages of
the measures development process to assess the clarity
and construct validity of all new measures.
Translation
Because English and Spanish are the two most com-
monly spoken languages in the U.S. [31], the team
developed and administered survey measures in both
languages. A dual language translation and validation
approach was employed using double measures transla-
tion with harmonization and validation. Specifically, two
professional bilingual translators of differing national
origins each independently translated the English lan-
guage measures. A third fluent Spanish speaker, who
served as the translation coordinator and primary
measures reviewer, then met with the two translators;
through discussion a final version of the Spanish lan-
guage measures was produced based on the two inde-
pendent
translations.
This
measures
harmonization
approach ensured that the Spanish language word
usage and syntax was equally accessible to individuals
of all Latino and Spanish backgrounds.
Testing
After the wording and order of the survey questions was
finalized, a pilot test of the proposed survey instrument
was implemented between August 5 and August 18,
2014. Several independent and non-overlapping conveni-
ence samples were used in the pilot (N = 151). To over-
sample smokers, half of the samples targeted low
income households earning less than $25,000 per year.
To boost the number of participants in the pilot who
identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual (GLB), a conveni-
ence sample of eleven individuals identifying as GLB
were recruited and called as a special batch to test the
programming specific to GLB participants. Oversam-
pling of young adults (18–25 years of age) occurred
within the household through the application of Poisson
sampling techniques where they held higher probabilities
of selection. The results of the pilot test were used to
inform minor survey item revisions and confirm the
accuracy of the survey programming.
Tobacco use measures
To maximize the fidelity of the tobacco use measures in
this study to other national surveys of tobacco product
use, many of the tobacco product-related items were taken
directly from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System (BRFSS) questionnaire [32] or from the Population
Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study [33].
Individuals were classified as current cigarette smokers if
they reported having previously smoked at least 100
cigarettes (i.e., five packs) in their lifetime and were
currently smoking some days or every day. Smokers were
asked about their past 30 day smoking frequency (number
of days), menthol cigarette use (none, some, or all ciga-
rettes), cigarette type (e.g., regular, light, ultralight), typical
brand (if any), and quit intentions (0 = not planning to quit
to 3 = within the next month).
Non-cigarette tobacco product (NCTP) use was also
assessed, with descriptions of the various NCTPs provided
to respondents. If individuals indicated ever use of a
particular NCTP, they were subsequently queried on their
frequency of use in the past 30 days. For the current
analyses NCTP use is defined as past 30 day use of any of
the following: electronic cigarettes or vaping devices, little
cigars or cigarillos, hookah, chewing tobacco, snus, pre-
mium cigars, or any other tobacco product. Any tobacco
use was defined as past 30 day NCTP use or an individual
reporting cigarette smoking some days or every day.
Tobacco constituent measures
A variety of questions related to tobacco constituent
information, knowledge, and perceptions were admi-
nistered. To determine the frequency of information-
seeking related to cigarette constituents, participants
were asked “Have you ever looked for information on
chemicals in cigarettes and cigarette smoke?” As a
follow-up question participants were asked “In which 1
of these 3 places would you most like to see information
on chemicals in cigarettes and cigarette smoke: on
cigarette packs, in stores, or online?” Twenty-four
cigarette smoke constituents were selected for assess-
ment by participants. In order to minimize participant
burden, the constituents were divided into 6 panels of 4
constituents
each,
with
each
participant
answering

Page 3 of 13
 questions for one panel (see Appendix A for the list of
constituents by panel).
FDA credibility
Multiple items related to FDA credibility were also
administered. Participants were asked whether they had
ever heard of the FDA and whether they felt the FDA could
“effectively regulate tobacco products.” Because sampling
efforts were particularly targeted to groups who have his-
torically have been marginalized or exploited by certain
U.S. governmental and other authoritative bodies, we also
assessed general trust in the government using the item:
“How much trust do you have in the federal government?”
Responses ranged from 0 = none at all to 4 = a great deal.
Demographics
Characteristics such as gender, age, ethnicity, education,
income were assessed primarily using measures from the
2013 BRFSS survey [31] or the 2010 U.S. Census [34].
Race was assessed using the item, “Which one of these
groups would you say best represents your race: White,
Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska
Native, Asian, or Pacific Islander?” Individuals strongly
identifying as an unlisted or mixed race were coded as
“Other.” Education was assessed using an ordinal scale
ranging from 0 = no schooling completed to 15 = doctor-
ate degree. Numeracy was assessed using a single item
adapted from a standard numeracy scale [35]: “In gen-
eral, which of these numbers shows the biggest risk of
getting a disease: 1 in 100, 1 in 1000, or 1 in 10?” Pov-
erty level was determined using the household size and
income reported by the respondents and applying the
federal poverty numbers available from the U.S. Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services in 2014. The sexual
orientation measure was developed using guidelines pro-
vided by the Williams Institute [36], which asked “Do
you consider yourself to be (A) straight or heterosexual,
(B) gay or lesbian, or (C) bisexual?”
Sampling and recruitment
Two independent and non-overlapping random digit dial-
ing frames were used in this study with approximately 98 %
coverage of all U.S. adult households [37]. To oversample
smokers, both frames were stratified by household income
and smoking rates at the county-level, where the poorest
counties with the highest smoking rates were oversampled.
Concordant with prior national tobacco survey studies
[38], we oversampled cell phones numbers to maximize
counts of young adults. To be considered eligible, a tele-
phone number needed to reach a household with an Eng-
lish- or Spanish-speaking resident 18 years of age or older.
Within the landline frame, if more than one eligible adult
resided in the household, young adults and smokers were
sampled at a higher rate than older adult nonsmokers.
The national survey was conducted between September
15, 2014 and May 31, 2015 and had an average completion
time of 25 min. Calls were made Saturday through Thurs-
day between 9 am and 9 pm (local time). Blaise CATI soft-
ware [39] was used to both manage the sample and collect
the data. No numbers were removed from calling until a
minimum of 6 (cell phone) to 8 (landline) unsuccessful call
attempts were made with at least one weekend, evening,
and daytime call attempt. The sample resulted in 5,014 in-
terviews
and
a
weighted
response
rate
(calculated
using AAPOR Response Rate 4) of 42 %, a rate which is
comparable to the 2012–2013 National Adult Tobacco Sur-
vey (44.9 %) [40] and the 2012 BRFSS (45.3 %) [41]. The
remaining sample consisted of ineligible numbers (64,410),
refusals from eligible households (2,623), or indeterminable
eligibility status (41,877). All interviewers completed gen-
eral and project-specific training before conducting the
surveys and were monitored twice fortnightly. In-
formed consent for participation in the study was ob-
tained
verbally
from
respondents
at
the
time
of
enrollment. The IRB at the University of North Caro-
lina approved all study procedures and respondents
were protected by a certificate of confidentiality.
Sampling weights and adjustments
A standard three-step sample weighting procedure was
followed to produce sampling weights [42]. The base
weights were computed using the sampling rate for tele-
phone numbers in each stratum, adjusting for the number
of eligible respondents and landline telephone numbers in
the household as well as any oversampling of young adults
and/or smokers that might have occurred in the landline
sample (Step 1). The base weights were then adjusted for
differential household-level nonresponse among sampling
strata using the inverse of the stratum-specific household-
level response rate as the adjustment factor (Step 2). The
nonresponse-adjusted household sample weight was then
calibrated to population counts as estimated from the
American Community Survey [34] sample by implementing
the SAS rake and trimming macro [43] on the following
variables: census region, age (18–24, 25–44, 45–64, or ≥ 65),
education (≤ high school, some college, or bachelor’s degree
and higher), gender, ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic),
phone-type (cell or landline) and regional smoking rates.
Final weights were normalized to the total sample size [44].
Analysis
All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3 and
took the sample design features into account. Weighted
sample means and proportions with 95 % confidence in-
tervals incorporating both sampling weight and strata var-
iables were computed using the PROC SURVEYMEANS
and PROC SURVEYFREQ procedures. Stratum-specific
weighted analyses by subgroup (e.g., smokers, young
Boynton et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:516 
Page 4 of 13
 adults) employed the BY command for the PROC SURV
EYMEANS procedure and the TABLE command for the
PROC SURVEYFREQ procedure. Weighted analyses of
intra-group differences for categorical variables (i.e., com-
parisons between smokers vs. non-smokers, young adults
vs. older adults, etc.) employed χ2 tests using the CHISQ
command. For the continuously scaled trust in the federal
government variable, means were generated using PROC
SURVEYMEANS and intra-group comparisons were made
using PROC SURVEYREG.
Results
Demographics
Examination of the weighted estimates revealed a weighted
proportion of 50.8 % females and an age range of 18 to
95 years (M = 45.9, SD = 17.3). The two largest racial groups
in this sample were White (68.3 %) and Black/African
American (18.3 %). Approximately 14 % of the sample iden-
tified as Latino or Hispanic. Young adults (i.e., individuals
aged 18–24) comprised 12.7 % of the sample and, based on
reported household size and annual income, 14.3 % of the
sample was identified as living below the U.S. federal pov-
erty line. In addition, 3.2 % of the sample identified as GLB.
In order to assess the quality of our sampling design
we compared this study’s weighted demographic esti-
mates to comparable national point estimates, thereby
providing a sense of the relative “representativeness” of
our weighted sample. As can been seen in Table 1,
across a wide range of demographic factors the majority
of estimates from other national surveys or the U.S.
Census fall within the 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of
the sample’s weighted point estimates. The only note-
worthy exceptions were race and ethnicity, which slightly
overestimates the proportions of Whites and African
Americans and slightly underestimates the proportions
of Asians and Latinos. In each case, the difference be-
tween the national estimate and the relevant confidence
interval bound was no more than 3.5 percentage points.
Tobacco product use
As a result of the oversampling strategy employed in this
study, smokers represented 23.0 % (N = 1151) of the
unweighted sample; however, at 17.8 % the weighted smok-
ing prevalence for the entire sample was effectively identical
to the national prevalence estimate (see Table 1). The na-
tional estimate for any tobacco product use (25.2 %), which
encompassed both cigarette and NCTP use, was within one
percentage point of the lower bound of the 95 % CI for our
estimate of 28.4 % [40]. Table 2 presents the weighted pro-
portion of smokers for key demographic characteristics.
Most of the estimates for our sample fell within the CIs of
the U.S. Census or other national estimates, with the re-
mainder falling within 2 percentage points of either the
upper or lower confidence bound.
Consistent with the literature, smoking rates were notably
higher for respondents reporting less education, low liter-
acy, and living below the federal poverty line. Further-
more, cigarette smoking was relatively higher for GLBs,
Native Americans, and NCTP users, a finding also con-
cordant with prior research [8]. The only notable differ-
ences between our estimates and other national estimates
of tobacco use were among Black (vs. White) and Latinos
(vs. non-Latinos), which were modestly overestimated.
Table 3 presents cigarette use characteristics for the
smokers. The majority (73.5 %) reported smoking every
day in the past 30 days. A little over a third of respon-
dents (38.8 %) reported only smoking menthols in the
past 30 days, and another 15.8 % smoked some menthols
during that time. Regular or full flavor cigarettes were
the most commonly smoked type (58.5 %), followed by
light or mild, (29.4 %). The Centers for Disease Control
and
Prevention (CDC)
estimates
for the
top four
cigarette brands in the U.S. are 41 % Marlboro, 12 %
Newport, 8 % Pall Mall, and 8 % Camel [45]. Our
weighted estimates were largely equivalent: Marlboro,
38.2 %, CI [32.7, 43.7], Newport, 20.1 %, CI [15.9, 24.3],
Pall Mall, 7.0 %, CI [4.0, 9.9], and Camel, 6.3 %, CI
[4.1, 8.4]. Notably, a majority of smokers (81.5 %)
reported planning to quit sometime in the future.
Differences in constituent and FDA-related perceptions
by vulnerable groups
Constituent information
Table 4 presents tobacco constituent communication find-
ings. More than a quarter of adults (27.5 %) reported hav-
ing looked for information on tobacco constituents. Of
those, higher proportions of smokers (34.3 %) and young
adults (37.2 %) had previously looked for this information,
as compared to non-smokers (26.1 %, p = .004) and older
adults (26.0 %, p < .0001), respectively. A smaller propor-
tion of individuals with low education reported having
previously looked for information on tobacco constituents
(22.2 %) as compared to those with greater educational at-
tainment than a high school diploma (31.5 %, p < .0001).
When asked where they would most like to see infor-
mation on tobacco constituents, over half indicated that
they would prefer it on cigarette packs (54.8 %) and an-
other quarter most wanted the information available on-
line (28.7 %). There was no difference between smokers
and non-smokers for information location preference;
however, as compared to older adults (27.4 %), a higher
proportion of young adults preferred that constituent in-
formation be available online (38.2 %, p = .0003).
Over one third of U.S. adults were not aware that any of
the four constituents in their survey panel were present in
cigarette smoke (37.5 %), and only 8 % knew that at least
three of the constituents in their survey panel are present
in cigarette smoke. Constituent awareness was lower for

 the low educational attainment (p < .0001) and low nu-
meracy groups (p = .02), with over 75 % of both sub-
groups not aware of more than 1 constituent in their
survey panel being present in cigarette smoke.
FDA credibility
The vast majority of U.S. adults (94.6 %) reported having
heard of the FDA, although awareness was lower for young
adults (90.9 %, p = .007), those with low education (89.7 %,
p < .0001), those with low numeracy (91.7 %, p = .0009),
and those living in poverty (87.5 %, p < .0001). The majority
of both smokers (66.6 %) and non-smokers (65.0 %) be-
lieved that the FDA can effectively regulate tobacco prod-
ucts. The proportions of people endorsing effective FDA
tobacco product regulation were even higher for young
adults (79.3 %, p < .0001) and GLBs (76.3 %, p = .04). Of
note, young adults were much more likely to identify as
GLB as compared to older adults, χ2(1) = 21.5, p < .0005.
In stark contrast to the relative support of the FDA, less
than half of U.S. adults (42.9 %) reported feeling some trust
in the federal government (i.e., a rating of 3 = a fair amount
or 4 = a great deal). On average, smokers reported less trust
in the federal government (M = 1.7) as compared to non-
smokers, (M = 2.0, p < .0001). Additionally, individuals living
in poverty had greater trust in the government (M = 2.2) as
compared to those not living in poverty, (M = 2.0, p = .004).
Discussion
The passage of the 2009 FSPTCA promised to usher in a
new
era
in
tobacco
regulation
that
has
enormous
implications for improving public health. The funding of 14
TCORS is an important advancement in the field of tobacco
regulatory science, with the national phone survey detailed
herein offering relevant and timely data that can inform FDA
policy and messaging efforts. The survey had a response rate
of 42 %, which is on par with other national tobacco surveys.
We found that our weighted tobacco use estimates mirrored
CDC estimates and U.S. demographic estimates largely fell
within the confidence bounds of our sample’s weighted esti-
mates. These finding indicate that our sample weights appro-
priately adjusted our estimates to reflect those of the U.S.
population. These encouraging findings pave the way for
additional analyses of data from this dataset, especially as
relevant to perceptions of tobacco product constituents,
FDA credibility, and tobacco communication.
Because tobacco product marketing and tobacco-related
health outcomes disproportionally impact younger and
marginalized communities as well as those with a history of
tobacco use, we chose to strategically oversample indi-
viduals from these groups. Comparisons between the un-
weighted and weighted estimates in Table 1 showed that
we successfully oversampled smokers and young adults as
well as achieved comparable proportions for individuals
with low educational attainment and those living in pover-
ty—a noteworthy achievement given that these groups tend
to be under-represented in national surveys [46]. By obtain-
ing robustly sized sub-samples, it was possible to generate
stable group estimates for key groups on a number of to-
bacco constituent and FDA credibility-related perceptions.
Examination of the constituent-related measures showed
that the majority of the U.S. public would like ready access
to tobacco constituent information. In fact, our results
reveal that groups one might presume to be the least psy-
chologically motivated to search for tobacco constituent
information, young adults and smokers, were most likely to
say that they had previously looked for this information.
Moreover, more than 80 % of U.S. smokers report in-
tending to eventually quit smoking, suggesting that many
smokers are in the contemplation stage of behavior change
and would therefore benefit from greater access to constitu-
ent information [47]. Taken together, these findings indicate
that the legislatively mandated publication of tobacco con-
stituent information is of great interest to the public, and if
executed well, could improve public health. Our results
also showed that different groups may prefer different
channels of information. For example, older adults pre-
ferred constituent information on cigarette packs whereas
young adults equally preferred it on packs and online. Given
these results, the FDA may want to consider making con-
stituent information available through multiple channels.
Although nearly one third of U.S. adults have actively
sought out information about tobacco constituents, the

 public appears to still be largely unaware of what constitu-
ents are contained in cigarette smoke. In the current study,
we asked respondents whether they had heard that each of
4 constituents are in cigarette smoke.. As there were six dif-
ferent panels, we ultimately obtained data on 24 unique
constituents, all of which appear on the FDA’s full list of 93
harmful and potentially harmful cigarette smoke constitu-
ents [48]. With the exception of nicotine, most people were
largely unaware of what constituents are present in
cigarette smoke. Over one third of respondents were un-
aware that even one of their listed constituents were
present in cigarette smoke, and another third only reported
knowing one of their four as being present in cigarette
smoke. Future FDA messaging efforts could benefit from
including information about the presence and health impli-
cations of tobacco constituents.
The data presented herein indicate that for most U.S.
adults the FDA is a known entity that is capable of regulat-
ing tobacco. In stark contrast, the majority of people in the
U.S. report low levels of trust in the “federal government.”
In other words, although FDA is a part of the federal gov-
ernment, individuals may not typically think of it as such.
Thus, in certain cases identifying the FDA as the source of
a counter tobacco message may help to increase the cred-
ibility and impact of the message.
Limitations and future directions
The current study’s strengths include the recruitment of a
large, nationally representative sample, targeted oversam-
pling of key vulnerable groups, and the development of psy-
chometrically valid health, tobacco use, and constituent
communication items administered in both English and
Spanish. Our study largely focused on constituents for
which the FDA has signaled that they are most likely to
require tobacco manufacturers to report quantity infor-
mation [49]. However, with well over 5,000 chemicals in
tobacco products [6] and 93 that the FDA has already iden-
tified as harmful or potentially harmful [48], future mes-
saging efforts will likely expand to include an array of
different constituents. Although our findings are consistent
with past research showing low levels of awareness for the
presence of the majority of constituents in cigarette smoke,
future studies exploring awareness of a wider range of
constituents would be informative, especially once the FDA
releases constituent information for tobacco products. A
second limitation is that the unique associations between
GLB status, age, and tobacco-related perceptions are some-
what difficult to disentangle because, as compared to older
adults, young adults more likely to identify as GLB. There
is a great need for more tobacco control research with
those who identify as GLB, especially considering that this
population has a substantially higher tobacco use rate as
compared to their non-GLB peers [50].

 Future analyses of our adult phone survey data will exam-
ine several key tobacco communication issues, and portions
of the survey will be repeated in two years’ time to examine
potential temporal changes. One important area meriting
further exploration is how the U.S. public perceives tobacco
product use in the context of learning about constituents in
cigarettes and NCTPs. In other words, there are a wide range
of possible constituents that the FDA could message on; it
would be instructive to explore whether certain types of con-
stituents have a greater or lesser impact on tobacco use risk
perceptions. Relatedly, given the highly technical names of
many onstituent names, it would be of value to examine
what contextual information might be important to include
with constituent disclosures to make clear the risks associ-
ated with their presence in cigarettes and NCTPs (e.g., what
health effects are caused by particular constituents).
Another critical tobacco communication issue is the pub-
lic’s perceptions of tobacco messaging agencies and their
public health campaigns [51], especially as related to per-
ceived source credibility [52]. Our preliminary findings
indicate that different vulnerable groups have varied per-
ceptions of the sources of tobacco health messages (e.g.,
FDA, CDC), suggesting that the source of messages may
need to be emphasized in different ways, depending on the
target audience. Future research that delves into the cogni-
tive mechanisms underlying these group differences in gov-
ernment organization credibility would be informative.
Conclusions
As the FDA moves forward with its tobacco policy and
communication efforts, the positive impact on tobacco
perceptions and use can be maximized by incorporating
empirical evidence considering issues such as constitu-
ent perceptions and tobacco regulatory agency messa-
ging credibility. Additional national survey work in the
U.S. context is needed in order to monitor the public’s
response to FDA communications as well as to identify
changing patterns of tobacco-related perceptions and
use, especially for vulnerable populations.
