ABSTRACT
Objective Erectile dysfunction (ED) is associated with 
an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in healthy 
men. However, the association between treatment for 
ED and death or cardiovascular outcomes after a first 
myocardial infarction (MI) is unknown.
Methods In a Swedish nationwide cohort study all 
men <80 years of age without prior MI, or cardiac 
revascularisation, hospitalised for MI during 2007–2013 
were included. Treatment for ED, defined as dispensed 
phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors or alprostadil, was related 
to risk of death, MI, cardiac revascularisation or heart 
failure.
Results Forty-three thousand one hundred and 
forty-five men with mean age 64 (±10) years were 
included, of whom 7.1% had ED medication dispensed 
during a mean 3.3 years (141 739 person-years) of 
follow 
-up. Men with, compared with those without 
treatment for ED, had a 33% lower mortality (adjusted 
HR 0.67 (95%CI 0.55 to  
0.81)), and 40% lower risk of 
hospitalisation for heart failure (HR 0.60 (95% CI 0.44 
to 0.82)). There was no association between treatment 
with alprostadil and mortality. The adjusted risk of death 
in men with 1, 2–5 and >5 dispensed prescriptions of 
phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors was reduced by 34% 
(HR 0.66 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.15), 53% (HR 0.47 (95% CI 
0.26 to 0.87) and 81% (HR 0.19 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.45), 
respectively, when compared with alprostadil treatment.
Conclusions Treatment for ED after a first MI 
was associated with a reduced mortality and heart 
failure hospitalisation. Only men treated with 
phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors had a reduced risk, which 
appeared to be dose-dependent.
INTRODUCTION
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is common. In men 
between 60 years and 70 years of age 20–40% 
will 
be affected depending on the definition of ED. 
Several previous studies in men without prevalent 
cardiovascular disease have shown an association 
between ED and increased risk of cardiovascular 
disease.1–3 The onset of ED has commonly been 
thought to precede the onset of cardiovascular 
disease by 3–5 years in men without cardiovascular 
disease.4 In a study of men with type 2 diabetes 
who underwent coronary angiography and were 
found to have coronary artery disease, ED was 
associated with a doubled risk of adverse outcome 
during follow-up.5 In a similar high-risk population 
for cardiovascular disease, ED was associated with 
almost a doubling of the risk of death.6
To the best of our knowledge there is no study 
which has investigated the association between 
treatment for ED, and long-term outcomes in men 
after a first myocardial infarction (MI). In order 
to investigate the association between treatment 
for ED, mortality and cardiovascular outcomes 
we conducted a nationwide cohort study which 
included all men with a first MI during 7 years in 
Sweden.
METHODS
Study population
From 1 January 2007 through 31 December 2013 
we included all men 18–80 years of age with a first 
MI in Sweden. The patients were identified from 
the Swedish Patient Register, where all hospital 
stays are registered with a complete coverage of 
the country.7 The day of admission for MI was 
defined as the index date. We excluded men with 
MI, 
revascularisation 
(percutaneous 
coronary 
intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting 
(CABG)), prostatectomy, surgery for rectal cancer 
before the index date, or any dispensed medication 
for ED from 1 July 2005 until the index date. The 
recruitment of the study population is described in 
figure 1.
The study complied with the guidelines of the 
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the 
regional ethics review board in Stockholm.
Exposure
Exposure was defined as at least one dispensed 
prescription of ED medication in the Prescribed 
Drug Register where all prescribed and dispensed 
 
medications 
in 
Sweden 
are 
registered 
with 
a 
complete 
coverage of the country since 1 July 2005.8 During 
the study period the following drugs for treatment 
of ED, with corresponding Anatomic Therapeutic 
Chemical codes, were available in Sweden: silde-
nafil (G04BE03), tadalafil (G04BE08), vardenafil 
(G04BE09), which all are phosphodiesterase-5 
(PDE-5) inhibitors, and alprostadil (G04BE01), 
which contains prostaglandin E1.
Definitions
Comorbidities at baseline were retrieved from 
the Swedish Patient Register and defined as a 
discharge diagnosis in the primary position before

the index date, except for active cancer which was defined as a 
diagnosis under the section C in International Classification of 
Disease version 10 during the 2 years preceding the index date, 
and diabetes which was defined as ongoing medication with any 
hypoglycaemic agent. Ongoing medication was defined as at 
least two dispensed medications during the year preceding the 
index date.
Outcomes and follow-up
Outcomes were retrieved from the Patient Register, only using 
diagnoses in the primary position. Major adverse cardiac event 
(MACE) was defined as a hospitalisation for MI, or heart failure, 
or revascularisation. Cardiovascular death was defined according 
to the definition of the European Society of Cardiology. Date 
and the primary cause of death were retrieved from the Cause-
of-Death register where all deaths in Sweden are registered.
Follow-up started 30 days after the index date, and ended 
for (A) all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and 
 
non-cardiovascular mortality when the patient died, underwent 
prostatectomy or surgery for rectal cancer, or 31 December 
2013, whichever occurred first, (B) for the specific outcomes 
analyses (MI, heart failure, revascularisation, MACE) when the 
patient was hospitalised for MI, or heart failure, or underwent 
revascularisation, underwent prostatectomy or surgery for rectal 
cancer, or 31 December2013, whichever occurred first.
Statistical methods
We computed descriptive statistics of patients’ characteristics 
assessed at the index date. For continuous variables we used 
t-tests and for categorical variables we used χ2 tests to assess 
differences between patients with, compared with those without, 
ED medication.
We used Cox proportional hazards regression model to esti-
mate HRs with 95% CI to assess the role of treatment for ED 
on, (A) all-cause mortality, (B) MI, (C) heart failure, (D) revas-
cularisation, (E) MACE, (F) cardiovascular mortality and (G) 
non-cardiovascular mortality, while adjusting for the following 
relevant variables: medications during follow-up (β-blockers, 
statins, nitrates, thiazide diuretics, opioids, selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors, ACE inhibitors/angiotensinogen-receptor 
blockers and neuroleptic drugs), comorbidities (chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease, diabetes, stroke, peripheral vascular 
disease, heart failure and active cancer). We assessed comorbid-
ities at the index date and included them as dichotomous vari-
ables. Ongoing medications at baseline and medications that were 
dispensed at least one time during the first 6 months following 
the event were adjusted for in our statistical models. Since virtu-
ally all patients who have been hospitalised with MI in Sweden 
will have nitrates prescribed at discharge, but most patients will 
never use them, for nitrates only, the subject was defined as user 
when the medication was dispensed for the second time during 
the follow-up. Moreover, we included treatment for ED as a 
time-varying variable, that is, the subject became exposed when 
ED medication was dispensed for the first time. In a second anal-
ysis we accounted for the type of the medication (PDE5-inhib-
itors or alprostadil) to study if the association of treatment for 
ED and the outcome all-cause mortality differed in relation to 
type of ED medication.
Time since 30 days after the index date was used as the time 
scale in the Cox model, with age at the index date included as a 
continuous covariate in the model. We estimated HRs with 95% 
CI to assess the role of ED medication as a potential predictor 
of our outcomes, after adjusting for the other potential predic-
tors. To assess the proportional hazards assumption, we used the

assumption was not fulfilled, we fitted stratified Cox regression 
models.
We performed a sensitivity analyses by starting follow-up 12 
months after the index date, in order to investigate the impor-
tance of the time that elapsed between index date and the start 
of ED medication.
p Values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data

RESULTS
Study population
In total, 43 145 men were included of whom 3068 had at least 
one ED medication dispensed during a mean  3.3 years (141 739 
person-years) of follow- 
up. Men who were treated for ED were 
younger, and less likely to have heart failure, diabetes, COPD, 
stroke, peripheral arterial disease and active cancer at baseline 
(table 1).
All-cause mortality, MI and heart failure
In total, there were 4853 deaths during follow-up, 112 (3.7%) 
in men with treatment for ED and 4741 (12%) in men without 
treatment for ED (table 2). The incidence rate for death was less 
than half, and the risk of death was 33% lower in men with, 
compared with men without treatment for ED (adjusted HR 
0.67 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.81)). When follow-up started at 365 
days after the index date, the association between treatment for 
ED and death was virtually identical (data not shown).
During  follow-up there were 99 (3.4%) MIs in patients with 
treatment for ED and 3089 (7.7%) MIs in patients without 
treatment for ED. The incidence rate of MI was higher in men 
without than with treatment for ED, but after adjustment for 
confounders no association between treatment for ED and risk 
of MI was found (table 2).
The incidence rate for heart failure hospitalisation was less 
than a third in men with treatment for ED, and they had a 40% 
lower risk of hospitalisation for heart failure during follow-up, 
compared with men without treatment for ED (adjusted HR 
0.60 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.82)).
Cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, 
revascularisation and MACE
We found an association between treatment for ED and risk of 
both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular death, with a reduced 
mortality of 36% and 21%, respectively (table 3). The incidence 
rate for revascularisation was lower in men with treatment for 
ED, compared with men without treatment for ED (1.96 vs 4.54 
cases/100 person-years), but after adjustment for confounders 
no association between treatment for ED and revascularisation 
was found. The incidence rate for MACE was almost a third, 
and the risk of MACE during follow-up was lower in men with 
compared with men without treatment for ED (adjusted HR 
0.79 95% CI 0.68 to 0.92). The associations between treatment 
for ED and the different outcomes are summarised in figure 2.

Age-stratified analysis
We found that among men <60 years, 60–69 years and 70–80 
years of age 1273/13 882 (9.2%), 1296/15 029 (8.6%) and 
499/14 234 (3.5%), respectively, were prescribed ED medica-
tion during follow-up. There was a strong inverse association 
between treatment for ED and risk of death in men 70–80 
years of age, with a 59% reduced risk in those with treat-
ment for ED, compared with those without treatment for ED 
(adjusted HR 0.41 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.59)). By contrast, there 
was no statistically significant association between treatment for 
ED and mortality in men <60 years and 60–69 years of age 
(see online supplementary table 1). However, the point estimate 
in men 60–69 years of age indicated a lower risk of death in 
men with treatment for ED, compared with men without treat-
ment for ED. Similarly, in the age group 70–80 years, there was a 
reduced risk of hospitalisation for heart failure during follow-up 
in patients with treatment for ED (adjusted HR 0.51 (95% CI 
0.30 to 0.89)). No association between treatment for ED and 
risk of MI during follow-up was found in any age group. The 
associations between treatment for ED and revascularisation, 
MACE, cardiovascular death and non-cardiovascular death in 
different age groups are described in table 2 (see online supple-
mentary table 2). 
PDE5-inhibitors versus alprostadil
Among 3068 patients who were using ED medication, 2814 
(92%) were using PDE5-inhibitors and 254 (8.3%) were using 
alprostadil. Among men who used PDE5-inhibitors 89 (3.2%) 
died during follow-up, compared with 23 (9.1%) among men 
who used alprostadil. The incidence rate of death per 100 
person-years was 1.25 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.54) among PDE5-in-
hibitor users and 3.19 (95% CI 2.12 to 4.79) among alprost-
adil users. The risk of death during follow-up was 38% lower 
in men who were treated with PDE5-inhibitors, compared with 
those without PDE5-inhibitors or alprostadil (adjusted HR 0.62 
(95% CI 0.50 to 0.77)). No association between risk of death 
and alprostadil use was found (adjusted HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.63 
to 1.44)).
When men who were using PDE5-inhibitors were categorised 
to those who had one, two to five and more than five 
numbers 
of dispensed prescriptions, and compared with men who were 
using alprostadil, the association between treatment with PDE5- 
inhibitors and reduced risk for all-cause mortality appeared to 
be dose dependent (adjusted HRs, 0.66 (95% CI, 0.38 to 1.15), 
0.47 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.87) and 0.19 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.45), 
respectively).
DISCUSSION
In this nationwide study, where all men with a first MI during 
7 years in Sweden were included, and followed for a mean of 
3.3 years, we found that treatment for ED was associated with a 
33% reduced risk of mortality, and 40% reduced risk of hospi-
talisation for heart failure.
A number of studies have previously investigated the asso-
ciation between ED, death and cardiovascular outcomes and 
provided contradictory results.1 3 These studies have been 
conducted both in men at high risk for cardiovascular events,5 6 
as well as in presumably healthy men.9–12 One study reported 
outcomes in relation to ED both among men with and without 
previous cardiovascular disease.13 In one of two prospective 
randomised controlled trials, both conducted in high-risk popu-
lations, there was no increased mortality in men with ED, while in 
the other study ED was associated with a more than doubled risk 
of death.6 14 In addition, in men without previous cardiovascular 
disease, contradictory results have been found.10–13 The associa-
tion between ED and risk of ischaemic heart disease appears to 
be stronger than the association for all-cause mortality, both in 
men with and without prevalent cardiovascular disease.1 3 These 
contradictory results may be related to differences in character-
istics of the study populations in terms of age, comorbidities, 
medication, definition of ED, study design or other factors such 
as length of follow-up.
Since we did not have any specific information on incident 
ED from questionnaires or any other source, and since we used 
dispensed ED medication as exposure and not ED itself, our find-
ings are not directly comparable to earlier studies. However, we 
are confident that all patients who had ED medication dispensed 
in fact had ED. In two previous studies on patients with preva-
lent coronary artery disease the prevalence of ED was 41% and 
47%, respectively.5 15 In one of these studies ED medication was 
reported and found to be used by only a third of the patients 
with ED.5 Thus, considering that less than 10% of the men in

Cardiac risk factors and prevention
the present study had any ED medication dispensed, there was 
most likely a large number of men with ED who did not have 
any medication for ED prescribed. Consequently, our findings of 
a strong reduction in mortality and heart failure  
hospitalisation 
was most likely associated with treatment of ED, and not 
 
ED itself.
To the best of our knowledge, only two studies that have inves-
tigated the associations between ED and cardiovascular disease 
have reported whether pharmacological treatment for ED was 
used or not.5 9 In one study, conducted in primary healthcare 
where the study population was restricted to men who sought 
help for ED, there was a trend of an increased risk for incident 
cardiovascular disease by 70% associated with ED before the 
introduction of PDE5-inhibitors.9 Interestingly, after the intro-
duction of sildenafil on the market, the association between 
ED and risk of cardiovascular disease virtually disappeared.9 
 
Similarly, in a study on men with diabetes with ED who had 
established coronary artery disease, those with PDE5-inhibitor 
treatment had a 32% relative risk reduction for MACE.5 The 
authors speculated on a protective effect of sildenafil. More 
than 9 out of 10 patients in the present study who were treated 
for ED had treatment with PDE5-inhibitors. The others were 
treated with alprostadil which contains prostaglandin E1 and 
is used locally. Men who were treated with alprostadil had a 
similar mortality as men without treatment for ED, while men 
on PDE5-inhibitors had a 38% lower risk of death compared 
with men without treatment with PDE5-inhibitors. Moreover, 
we found that there was a dose-dependent association between 
treatment with PDE5-inhibitors and risk for death, where men 
with two to five, and more than five dispensed prescriptions had 
the strongest risk reduction when compared with men treated 
with alprostadil. However, this finding has to be interpreted 
cautiously since the CIs were wide due to few cases. Although 
our results indicate that the reduced risk of mortality and 
hospitalisation for heart failure may be related to cardioprotec-
tive effects of PDE5 
-inhibitors themselves, our findings should 
be regarded as no more than hypothesis-generating.16
Even if a causal relationship between treatment with PDE5- 
inhibitors and a reduced risk of adverse outcome cannot be 
determined from our findings, both previous animal and human 
studies have found possible mechanisms for protective effects of 
PDE5-inhibitors. In animal studies, PDE5-inhibitors have shown 
to exert anti-ischaemic effects in the heart,17–19 and attenuated 
development of heart failure after induced MI,20 or induced 
chronic mitral regurgitation.21 In humans, PDE-5 inhibitors have 
been suggested as treatment for volume-overload heart failure,22 
and have been investigated in a trial in patients with recent MI 
and diastolic dysfunction.23 Although no effect was seen on 
the primary end point pulmonary arterial pressure, there was 
an increase in stroke volume, cardiac output and also a reduc-
tion in left ventricular afterload.23 Also, in a randomised place-
bo-controlled double-blind study treatment with vardenafil, a 
PDE5-inhibitor, resulted in reduced aortic stiffness.24 In addi-
tion, the effect of vardenafil on aortic stiffness was augmented by 
concurrent treatment with statins. Furthermore, PDE5-inhibi-
tors improved haemodynamic and clinical parameters in subjects 
with congestive heart failure.25
The ability of ED to predict cardiovascular disease seems to 
be age related. The association is stronger among younger men, 
and appears to disappear or weaken markedly after the age of 
60 years.16 26–28 In three previous studies, ED was not associ-
ated with cardiovascular disease in men above the age of 70 
years.27–29 In another study there was even a trend to a reduced 
risk of incident cardiovascular disease in men 70 years of age or 
older with ED.26 These findings are interesting in the context of 
our study where we found a markedly reduced risk by 59% for 
death, and 49% for hospitalisation for heart failure among men 
70 years of age or older who were treated for ED. In men 60

Cardiac risk factors and prevention
years to 69 years of age with treatment for ED there was a trend 
towards a reduced risk of mortality and heart failure.
The main limitation of our study was that we studied treat-
ment for ED and not ED itself. Most likely this introduced 
potential confounding bias, since men who were healthier may 
have been more prone to ask for treatment for ED. Indeed, 
patients with treatment for ED were younger, and healthier 
than patients without treatment for ED. However, even after 
adjustment for these differences there was a significant reduc-
tion in risk for adverse outcome among men with treatment 
for ED. There may have been other factors, which we had no 
information about, such as marital status, smoking, physical 
activity, disposable income or education level which may have 
been related both to the outcomes, and to the likelihood of being 
treated for ED, that may have affected our results. Indeed, in a 
previous study it was found that men with ED were more likely 
to ever have discussed ED with their general practitioner if they 
were married or had a higher education.30 Thus, our results have 
to be interpreted cautiously since treatment for ED most likely 
is a marker of good health and of higher income, a higher likeli-
hood of being married, higher education, and a more active and 
healthy lifestyle in general. The analysis where the association 
between number of dispensed prescriptions and mortality was 
investigated was not done using the exposure as a time-varying 
covariate since this would have significantly reduced the number 
of exposed and events. Thus, these figures have to be interpreted 
cautiously since this may have introduced immortal time bias, 
meaning that men who had more dispensed prescriptions had 
to be alive longer in order to be able to get them. Also, we did 
not have information about blood pressure levels which may 
have affected the willingness of the physician to prescribe ED 
medication.
The main strength of our study was the large study popu-
lation, the high-quality healthcare registers from which we 
retrieved the study population, and where patient characteristics 
and outcomes have been found to have high validity in previous 
studies.7 Furthermore, we had information on all medications 
that were dispensed during follow-up, including those which 
may affect erectile function, as antidepressants, opioids and 
antipsychotics.8 Information from these registers allowed us to 
exclude patients with organic reasons for ED as surgery in the 
pelvic region, and to adjust for treatment for ED that may have 
been related to psychiatric disease, or use of opioids. Further-
more, as the coverage of these registers is virtually complete 
and countrywide, the risk of misclassification of exposure or 
outcome was small, and there was no loss to follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS
We found that men who were treated for ED after a first MI had 
a reduced risk of death and hospitalisation for heart failure. Men 
who were treated with PDE5-inhibitors had a markedly reduced 
risk of death or heart failure, which appeared to be dose depen-
dent, whereas those with alprostadil treatment had a similar risk 
of adverse outcome as men with no treatment for ED. Since 
treatment for ED is associated with confounding by indication, 
meaning that healthier men are more likely to get treatment for 
ED, our results should be interpreted cautiously.
Correction notice Since this paper was first published online the full text version 
has been updated. The results section in the abstract which stated ‘7.1% had ED 
medication dispensed during a mean 6.2 years (141 739 person-years) of follow-up.’ 
now states ‘a mean 3.3 years (141 739 person-years) of follow-up.’ This update was 
also made in two other sections of the article.

Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is associated with an increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease in previously healthy men. The association 
between treatment for ED and death, or cardiovascular outcomes 
after a first myocardial infarction (MI) is unknown.
What might this study add?
In this observational, nationwide study that included 43 
145 men with a first MI we found that treatment with 
phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors was associated with a markedly 
reduced risk of death, and hospitalisation for heart failure.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
Our findings indicate that treatment with phosphodiesterase-5 
inhibitors may be related to a reduced risk of long-term adverse 
outcomes after MI. However, our findings have to be interpreted 
cautiously since we were not able to adjust for marital status, 
household income or other lifestyle factors that may be related 
to both the use of ED medication and prognosis.
