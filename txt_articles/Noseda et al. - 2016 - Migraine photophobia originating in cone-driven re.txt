Migraine headache is uniquely exacerbated by light. Using psychophysical assessments in patients with normal eyesight we found
that green light exacerbates migraine headache significantly less than white, blue, amber or red lights. To delineate mechanisms, we
used electroretinography and visual evoked potential recording in patients, and multi-unit recording of dura- and light-sensitive
thalamic neurons in rats to show that green activates cone-driven retinal pathways to a lesser extent than white, blue and red; that
thalamic neurons are most responsive to blue and least responsive to green; and that cortical responses to green are significantly
smaller than those generated by blue, amber and red lights. These findings suggest that patients’ experience with colour and
migraine photophobia could originate in cone-driven retinal pathways, fine-tuned in relay thalamic neurons outside the main visual
pathway, and preserved by the cortex. Additionally, the findings provide substrate for the soothing effects of green light.

 Introduction
Exacerbation of headache by light (photophobia) is commonly
associated with intracranial pathologies such as migraine, men-
ingitis, concussion, and subarachnoid haemorrhage (Welty and
Horner, 1990; Lamonte et al., 1995; Aurora et al., 1999;
Kawasaki and Purvin, 2002). It is experienced by �80% of
migraineurs with normal eyesight (Liveing, 1873; Selby and
Lance,
1960;
Drummond,
1986;
Choi
et
al.,
2009).
Although not as incapacitating as the headache, photophobia
renders migraineurs dysfunctional as they are forced to halt
fundamental daily tasks to seek the comfort of darkness.
Because of the frequency of attacks, migraineurs endure a sub-
stantial burden that interferes with work and home life.
Attempting to understand how light exacerbates migraine
headache, we reported that photic signals that originate in
intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells containing
melanopsin, a photoreceptor with peak sensitivity to blue
light (Lucas et al., 2001; Berson et al., 2002; Hattar et al.,
2003),
converge
on
thalamic
trigeminovascular
neurons
believed to relay nociceptive signals from the dura to the
cortex during migraine (Noseda et al., 2010). Consequently,
we suggested that this ‘non-image forming’ pathway might
explain the preferential sensitivity to blue light in blind mi-
graine patients, who, in spite of losing the ability to form
images due to degeneration of cones and rods, can detect
light (Noseda et al., 2010).
Based on our data as well as earlier observations made in
subjects lacking the outer retina (Zaidi et al., 2007), an
impression was created that blue light could be fundamen-
tal to migraine-type photophobia and that the exacerbation
of the headache by light could be minimized by devices
(sunglasses, contact lens) that block the blue light (Good
et al., 1991; Main et al., 2000; Adams et al., 2006;
Blackburn et al., 2009). Although this notion was gener-
ated by observations made in blind migraineurs lacking
cones and rods (Zaidi et al., 2007), rather than in migrain-
eurs with normal eyesight, it raised the question of whether
colours can modulate headache intensity differently in mi-
graineurs whose retinas contain functioning cones and
rods.
Materials and methods
All study visits took place at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center (BIDMC), Boston, MA (September 2010 to May 2015).
The BIDMC Committee on Clinical Investigations approved
the study and all participants provided written informed con-
sent. Patients were recruited from the BIDMC Comprehensive
Headache Center, Neurology clinic, and the primary care clinic
and from advertisements at the Medical Center and Harvard
Medical School. Subjects aged 15–85 years old were poten-
tially eligible for the study if they met the International
Classification of Headache Disorders Committee (2013) cri-
teria for migraine with or without aura, were able to commu-
nicate in English and were willing to attend a visit during an
untreated migraine attack. Exclusion criteria included fewer
than five headache-free days per month, chronic head or
neck pain not attributed to migraine, chronic use of opioids
(515 days/month for three previous consecutive months or
longer), or having an ocular disease. For this study an ocular
disease was defined as a primary and persisting visual disorder,
including anterior chamber of the eye disease (such as glau-
coma), macular degeneration, retinal degenerative diseases,
cones dystrophy, rods dystrophy, achromatopsia (colour blind-
ness, i.e. either totally colourblind or almost totally colour-
blind), retinitis pigmentosa, Leber’s congenital amaurosis,
albinism, night blindness, or cortical blindness due to posterior
circulation stroke. Participants were permitted to stop the
study or any phase of testing at any time.
Psychophysical studies assessing
patients’ sensitivity to different
colours of light during migraine
The study included 69 migraine patients. Of these, 41 com-
pleted
the
psychophysical
assessments
during
migraine.
Assessments included the effects that different colours of
light had on the: (i) intensity of their headache; (ii) throbbing;
(iii) muscle tenderness; and (iv) cephalic areas affected by the
pain. These assessments were made during untreated migraine
attacks. Prior to testing, patients were allowed to sit in a dimly
lit room for 20 min. The light was then turned off for 3 min
and patients were asked to verbally rate their headache inten-
sity on a scale of 0–10, outline its location (e.g. in, behind and
around the eyes, in the forehead, temple, top of the head, back
of the head, on one side or on both), and indicate whether the
headache throbbed and whether their neck muscles felt tender.
Their answers at that time, prior to beginning of sensitivity-to-
colour testing, were used to define their baseline. Once a base-
line was established, participants were positioned in front of a
full-field ganzfeld ColorDome (Diagnosys LLC), the light was
turned
on
at
the
lowest
intensity
(1 cd�m�2),
and
then
increased incrementally (1, 5, 20, 50 and 100 cd�m�2) every
30 s. As a reference, 1 cd�m�2 provides a background light that
is just above dark level whereas 100 cd�m�2 is equivalent to a
normally lit office space. The first light was white, the second
was blue (447 � 10 nm), the third was green (530 � 10 nm),
the fourth was amber (590 � 10 nm), and the fifth was red
(627 � 10 nm) (Supplementary Fig. 1). While looking at the
light (full-field), they were asked to describe any change (wor-
sening or improvement) in their headache intensity, appear-
ance of headache in areas outside its original site, onset of
throbbing (only in cases in which the headache did not
throb at baseline), and onset of muscle tenderness (only in
cases in which muscles did not feel tender at baseline). To
reduce the number of variables, all participants underwent
the same sequence of stimulation (white, blue, green, amber,
red). To minimize additive effects, patients were allowed to sit
in total darkness for 3 min between consecutive series of stimu-
lation or as long as it took for their headache intensity, head-
ache location, throbbing and muscle tenderness to return to
their baseline level. Supporting the fact that the order of stimu-
lation did not affect the results, were the following: (i) the least
‘photophobic’ green light was always presented after the highly
‘photophobic’ white and blue lights; and (ii), patients’ rating of
the headache when exposed to amber and red lights, which
appear at the end of the order of stimulation, were similar to

 their rating when exposed to white and blue lights, which
appear at the beginning of the order of testing.
Electroretinography recording
Electroretinographies (ERGs) were recorded in 46/69 patients;
three were excluded due to unreliable recording. As recom-
mended
by
the
International
Society
for
Clinical
Electrophysiology of Vision (McCulloch et al., 2015) we
used the full-field (ganzfeld) stimulation method as it increases
recording stability, reproducibility and reliability by delivering
the photic stimuli to all photoreceptors at a relatively homo-
genous manner. To minimize discomfort, the pupils were not
dilated and the ERG recordings were not done through a con-
tact lens electrode. Rather, all ERG recording were done using
one disposable, low-impedance silver/nylon corneal recording
electrode (DTL Plus) that is comfortable and easy to use, one
reference gold cup electrode placed on the forehead, and a
ground silver ear clip electrode placed on the ipsilateral ear.
To ensure good ocular contact and proper electrode imped-
ance, we first ran a few test stimuli to verify that the recorded
waveforms
were
comparable
to
the
standard
ERG.
Amplification of signals, fixation point and other technical as-
pects of our ERG recording, all provided technically by the
same ColourDome used in the psychophysical studies, adhered
to the guideline of ‘Standard for clinical electroretinography’
as defined in McCulloch et al. (2015).
Light-adapted, single-flash, cone electroretinography
Before recording cone ERG, patients were given 10 min to
adapt to the background light. The stimulus intensity of each
flash of light was 3.0 cd�s�m�2 (calculated as time integrated
luminance and measured in photopic candela-seconds per
meter square), the duration was 4 ms, and the background
luminance was 30 cd�m�2. At this background luminance,
rods are saturated and do not respond to light increment or
decrement (Hood and Finkelstein, 1986). Using these param-
eters, each colour of light was flashed nine times at a 1-s
interval. The nine flashes of light were divided to three
series; each averaged the ERG signals recorded over three
flashes of light (Supplementary Fig. 2A). The order of colour
stimuli was white, blue, green, amber and red. For compari-
sons,
we
measured
a-wave
amplitude
(from
baseline
to
trough), b-wave amplitude (from trough of a-wave to peak
of b-wave) and the implicit time (from stimulus onset to
peak b-wave) as described in Supplementary Fig. 2D.
Light-adapted 30 Hz flicker cone electroretinography
The 30 Hz flickering ERG consisted of 150 single flashes of
light, delivered over a period of 5 s. At 30 Hz, rods do not
contribute to the ERG signal as they cannot follow this
speed (Dodt, 1951). As above, the intensity of each flash of
light was 3.0 cd�s�m�2, the duration was 4 ms, and the back-
ground illumination was 30 cd�m�2. Using these parameters,
each patient was exposed to three series of 150 single flashes
(29 ms interstimulus interval) per colour in the same order as
above, and the average of the three series was used in the data
analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2B). Because the first few ERGs
could represent responses to a single flash, they were dis-
carded. For comparisons, we measured a-wave amplitude
(trough), b-wave amplitude (peak) and the implicit time as
described in Supplementary Fig. 2D.
Dark-adapted rod electroretinography
Before recording the rod system ERG, patients were kept in
total darkness for 20 min. To minimize detection by cones,
dim flashes of light (0.01 cd�s�m�2, 4 ms) were delivered in
the absence of background illumination. As in the light-
adapted flash ERG, each colour of light was flashed nine
times at a 1.1-s interval. The nine flashes of light were divided
into three series; each averaged the ERG signals recorded over
three flashes of light (Supplementary Fig. 2C). As above, dark-
adapted rod ERGs were repeated with white, blue, green,
yellow and red lights. For comparisons, we measured b-
wave
amplitude
and
time
to
peak
as
described
in
Supplementary Fig. 2D.
Multi-unit recording in the rat
thalamus
Animals and surgical procedures
Experiments were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center and Harvard Medical School standing com-
mittees on animal care, and conducted in accordance with the
U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals. Twenty-five male Sprague-Dawley
rats (250–350 g) were initially anaesthetized with a single
dose of methohexital sodium (45 mg/kg intraperitoneally) for
endotracheal intubation and cannulation of the right femoral
vein. Rats were then mounted on a stereotaxic frame and
connected to a gas anaesthesia system that delivers a mixture
of isoflurane and oxygen at 100 ml/min. Surgical procedures
were performed using 2.5% isoflurane, while the subsequent
experimental protocol was carried out under 1–1.2% isoflur-
ane. End-tidal CO2, blood oxygen saturation, respiratory and
heart rates, and core body temperature were continuously
monitored and kept within physiological range throughout
the experiment. Two craniotomies were performed. The first
was drilled on the left side of the skull at the lambdoid suture
to allow stimulation of the dura overlying the transverse sinus.
A second craniotomy was made on the right side of the skull
(�2.5 mm behind bregma; �2.5 mm lateral to the midline) to
access the posterior thalamic area for extracellular multi-site,
multi-unit recording with tetrodes (see below) (Supplementary
Fig. 3A). The exposed dura was kept moist using modified
synthetic interstitial fluid (pH 7.2). Immobilization of animals
during recordings was achieved by continuous intravenous
infusion of a mixture of the muscle relaxants vecuronium
(1 mg/ml) and rocuronium (5 mg/ml) in NaCl 0.9% at a rate
of 1 ml/h (1:1).
In vivo electrophysiological recordings
Multi-unit extracellular recordings were performed using three
quartz-insulated platinum/tungsten tetrodes (1–2 M�) mounted
on a remote-controlled microdrive system equipped with a 12-
channel low noise pre-amplifiers (Tetrode Mini Matrix, Thomas
Recording). We used tetrodes instead of conventional microelec-
trodes as they increase the yield and reliability of single-unit
isolation from multi-unit recordings (Gray et al., 1995). All
12-channel continuous electrophysiological signals were ampli-
fied using a multichannel programmable gain main amplifier
(PGMA, Thomas Recording). Data were acquired using an ex-
panded Micro1401-mkII digitizer unit (CED) and sent to a PC

 for additional post-acquisition processing (see signal processing
below). Preliminary real-time waveform discrimination was per-
formed for initial characterization of neuronal responses using
Spike2 software (CED), and was based on template creation
from spontaneous and evoked action potentials. The three tet-
rodes were independently lowered into the right posterior thal-
amus in search of neuronal discharges evoked by electrical
pulses (0.8 ms, 0.5–3.0 mA, 1 Hz) applied on the exposed
contralateral dura. If an isolated waveform corresponding to a
single neuron exhibited discrete firing bouts in response to such
electrical pulses, mechanical (calibrated von-Frey monofilament)
and chemical (1 M KCl) stimulation of the dura were also
applied to confirm the presence of at least one dura-sensitive
neuron per experiment in the multi-unit signal. Once a dura-
sensitive neuron was found, the recording tetrode remained in
its position while attempts were made to find more such neu-
rons with the other two independent tetrodes. When neuronal
search was finalized, all three tetrodes remained in their final
position for the rest of the experiment (see experimental design
for details). At the end of the recording session, electrolytic le-
sions marking recording location of each tetrode were made by
passing 10mA direct current for 10s with a stimulus generator
connected
to
an
integrated
impedance/stimulation
device
(Thomas Recording). Subsequently, each rat was euthanized
with an overdose of pentobarbital sodium (100mg/kg intraper-
itoneally and perfused with 200 ml of saline), followed by
400 ml of a fixative solution [4% paraformaldehyde in phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS)]. Brains were removed, soaked in
30% sucrose-PBS for 48 h, frozen, cut into coronal sections
(80-mm thick) using a cryostat (Leica), and mounted on glass
slides for imaging. Digital images of sections containing electro-
lytic lesions were obtained with epifluorescence microscopy
(Leica) and superimposed over an atlas of the rat brain
(Paxinos and Watson, 2008). Counterstaining with neutral red
was also performed to confirm precisely anatomical location of
each recording site.
Experimental design: neuronal classification and
photic stimuli
Experiments were performed when stable recording of multi-
unit activity was established in the three tetrodes over a resting
period of 20–30 min. For a posteriori classification, neurons
were tested for their responsiveness to the electrical, mechanical
and chemical stimulation of the contralateral dura. Neurons
responding to two of three modalities of dural stimulation
were classified as dura-sensitive; neurons responding to fewer
than two modalities were classified as dura-insensitive. Once
classified, neurons were tested for their responses to photic sti-
muli. Prior to beginning of photic stimuli, the light was turned
off for a period of 15min. The colours-of-light stimulation
paradigm (dark-light-dark, 1 min each) started at the end of
the dark period (Supplementary Fig. 3B). Calibrated photic
stimulation was delivered using a customized ColourBurst
stimulator (Diagnosys LLC) positioned 1 cm from the cornea.
White, blue, green and red lights were projected at the same
order and same maximal intensity (100 cd�m�2) used in the
human studies. A neuron was classified as light sensitive if it
responded to at least one colour of light. A response was con-
sidered positive if a stimulus increased the firing rate over the
baseline by 42 standard deviations (SD).
Signal processing: detection and sorting of spikes
from individual neurons
The amplified 12-channel continuous electrophysiological sig-
nals were sampled at 30 kHz and filtered between 0.3 and
6 kHz. Offline, data were exported to Matlab
� and processed
for spike detection and sorting using Wave_clus algorithm
(Quiroga et al., 2004). Briefly, this algorithm combines new
methods for setting amplitude thresholds for spike detection,
the wavelet transform for spike features extraction with optimal
resolution in both time and frequency domains, and superpar-
amagnetic clustering for grouping spikes belonging to a single
neuron. Manual adjustments of settings in the Wave_clus GUI
were also used when the automatic clustering performed by the
algorithm did not provide well-isolated clusters of single units.
Once the units were satisfactorily isolated, data were sent to
NeuroExplorer
� for the evaluation of neuronal responses and
construction of peri-stimulus histograms.
Visual evoked potential recording
Visual evoked potentials were recorded in 46/69 participants.
Of these, only 28 yielded waveforms with clearly identifiable
N1, P1, N2 and P2 deflections. As recommended by the
International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision
guideline for visual evoked potential standard (Odom et al.,
2010), we elicited full field light flashes using the ColorDome
system. Recordings were made using gold-disc surface elec-
trodes. The active electrode was placed on the scalp over the
visual cortex (at point Oz); the reference electrode was placed
over the forehead (at point Fz); the ground electrode was
placed on the scalp over the vertex (at point Cz) (American
Encephalographic Society, 1994). To establish colour-specific
visual evoked potentials, patients were placed in a dimly illu-
minated room (non-dilated pupils), and presented with five sets
of photic stimuli in the following order: white, blue, green,
yellow and red. Each set of photic stimuli consisted of 64
flashes of light delivered at 1.1 Hz (frequency), 3.0 cd�s�m�2
(intensity), 4 ms (duration). Analysis time was set at 300 ms.
Because peaks of N2 and P2 waves are the most robust com-
ponents of flash visual evoked potentials (Supplementary Fig.
4B), comparisons between visual evoked potential responses to
white, blue, green, amber and red were based on their ampli-
tudes and time to peak.
Calibration and quantification of
photic stimulation
Repeated calibrations of our ColorDome with the international
light technologies photometer (ILT1700) and an Ocean Optics
Maya LSL spectrometer were used to verify that the different
colours of light were delivered at equal luminance. For ex-
ample, when the nominal luminance was set at 3 cd�m�2 in
the Espion software (Diagnosys LLC), the measured luminance
for
blue,
green,
amber
and
red
was
2.96,
3.0,
3.36,
2.76 cd�m�2, respectively. To ensure that each of these colours
appeared to be exactly the same luminance to our participants
(i.e. taking into account differences in photopic sensitivity of
the human retina), our ColorDome delivered different power
with each photic stimulus. When the measured luminance for
blue, green, amber and red was 2.96, 3.0, 3.36, 2.76 cd�m�2,
the respective power was 32.2, 1.9, 2.1, and 4.9 mW/cm2/nM.

 Statistical analysis
Detailed descriptions of all statistical analyses are included in
the Supplementary material and in Supplementary Tables 1–6.
Briefly, data from the psychophysical, ERG and visual evoked
potential studies in migraineurs were analysed using Mixed
Linear Models (MLM), and data from the animal studies of
thalamic neurons were analysed using exact logistic regression
analysis and Fisher’s one-sample randomization (permutation)
test. Statistical significance was set at P 5 0.05.
Results
Sixty-nine
patients
diagnosed
with
migraine
(The
International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2013),
photophobia, and no known ocular diseases, were studied.
Their demographic and headache characteristics are shown
in Table 1. They were 40 � 12 years of age (mean � SD),
mostly female (91%), with migraine history of 19 � 12
years. Their attacks lasted 56 � 48h, and were associated
with aura (36%), moderate to severe headache intensity
(97%), unilateral location (70%), pulsating quality (77%),
nausea or vomiting (83%) and phonophobia (86%).
Psychophysical studies in migraineurs
To determine whether there is a colour preference to mi-
graine-type photophobia, we assessed the effects of white
and four different colours of light on: (i) proportion of
migraine patients who reported changes in headache inten-
sity; (ii) magnitude of change in pain rating; (iii) number of
patients who report change in sensory perception other
than headache intensity; and (iv) spread of headache from
its original site. Specifically, in 41 patients undergoing acute
migraine attack we assessed headache intensity, headache
location, throbbing, and muscle tenderness at dark (base-
line) and during exposure to five series of photic stimuli.
Each series consisted of 3 min in total darkness, followed
by an incremental increase in the intensity of white, blue,
green, amber and red lights (see ‘Materials and methods’
section and Supplementary Fig. 1). At the end of each
series, the light was turned off and subjects were given
sufficient time for their headache intensity to return to
baseline.
Proportion of migraine patients who reported
changes in headache intensity
The proportion of patients reporting changes in pain severity
when exposed to the different colours of light increased in
accordance with the elevated intensities of light (Fig. 1A). At
the highest intensity (100cd�m�2), nearly 80% of the pa-
tients demonstrated an intensification of headache; this was
true for all colours except the green, which affected half that
proportion of patients. Unexpectedly, exposure to green light
reduced pain intensity in �20% of the patients.
Magnitude of change in pain rating
As to response magnitude, the headache intensity also
increased in accordance with light intensity augmentation,
demonstrating a comparable change for all colours of light
but green. The latter decreased pain perception more effect-
ively at low (1 and 5 cd�m�2) than at medium (20, 50 and
100 cd�m�2) intensities (Fig. 1B). To determine the extent to
which the different colours of light increased or decreased
pain ratings, a separate analysis examined pain-rating differ-
ences only in trials in which exposure to light altered pain
perception. At medium intensity, blue and red increased pain
ratings by 18–19%, white and amber by 15%, whereas
green increased the pain by 55% (Fig. 1C). Conversely,
at low intensity, green light emerged as the only colour to
induce a decrease in pain ratings; reduction was �15%.
Comparing the changes in headache severity in response to
each colour of light at each intensity indicated that the re-
sponse to green was significantly smaller as compared to all
other colours in all intensity levels (Fig. 1D). As no inter-
action was found between the variables ‘colour’ and ‘inten-
sity’ (P = 0.735), we concluded that the effect of ‘colour’ on
change in pain intensity did not depend on the value of
‘intensity’. Accordingly, the effect that each colour of light
had on the change in pain rating (compared to baseline) was
examined regardless of ‘intensity’ (i.e. all data per colour
were
pooled).
This
analysis
showed
that
white,
blue,
amber and red induced a significant increase in pain ratings
as compared to their baselines (P 5 0.0001 for each com-
parison; Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 1D); green was the
only colour that did not demonstrate a significant change
from the baseline pain ratings (P = 0.7; Supplementary Table
1 and Fig. 1D). A comparison between the different colours
showed that green induced significantly smaller changes in
pain ratings as compared to white, blue, amber and red
(P 5 0.0001 for each comparison), and that white evoked
significantly
smaller
changes
as
compared
to
blue
(P = 0.002), red (P = 0.002) and amber (P = 0.03). The re-
maining
comparisons
were
insignificant
(Supplementary
Table 2).
Patients who report change in sensory perception
other than headache intensity
Consistent with the findings above, blue, amber and red
induced throbbing and muscle tenderness in more patients
(40–50% for throbbing and 11–19% for muscle tender-
ness) than white and green (20–24% for throbbing and
8% for muscle tenderness) (Fig. 1E).
Spread of headache from its original site
Spread of headache is another dimension of photophobia
demonstrating colour preference (Fig. 1F). Here again,
more
patients
described
spreading
of
headache
when
exposed to blue (n = 19), amber (n = 17) and red (n = 21)
than to white (n = 9) and green (n = 11). Of those, �25%
reported spread of pain from front to back, and 35% re-
ported that their headaches spread to the contralateral side.

 Electroretinography studies in
migraineurs
To explain the psychophysical findings, we sought to deter-
mine whether electrical signal generated by the retina in re-
sponse to green light differed from those generated by the
other colours. To answer this question we studied 45 mi-
graine patients when they were pain-free; 43 yielded reliable
ERG waveforms. Each patient underwent (i) light-adapted
single-flash cone ERG; (ii) light-adapted 30-Hz flicker cone
ERG; and (iii) dark-adapted rod ERG, as recommended by
the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of
Vision (ISCEV; McCulloch et al., 2015). Each ISCEV ERG
condition was done with white and then repeated with blue,
green, amber and red (See ‘Materials and methods’ section
and Supplementary Fig. 2).
In light-adapted single-flash cone ERG, b-wave amplitude
[calculated from trough to peak; expressed as median (95%
confidence interval); Fig. 2A, D and G] generated by green
light [99.78 mV (87 to 111.51)] was significantly smaller
(P 5 0.001) than the blue [119.54 mV (110.52 to 130.51)]
and white [105.9 mV (98.21 to 119.83)] amplitudes but simi-
lar to the amber [94.14 mV (85.29 to 104.46)] and red
[97.42mV (93.51 to 107.97)] amplitudes (Supplementary
Table 3). The significantly larger blue b-wave amplitude
(compared to all other colours, P 5 0.001 for each compari-
son) stemmed from greater a-wave amplitude [�43.03 mV
(�46.52 to �38.85); all others from �27.54mV (�30.18
to �21.54) to �24.97mV (�31.26 to �22.95); Fig. 2A, D,
G and Supplementary Table 3].
In
contrast,
in
the
light-adapted
flicker
cone
ERG
(Fig. 2B, E and H), the b-wave amplitude generated by
green light [64.77 mV (56.24 to 70.26)] was significantly
smaller
(P 5 0.003)
than
that
generated
by
blue
[83.41 mV (73.75 to 91.31)], red [71.69 mV (66.82 to
74.76)],
and
white
[69.15 mV
(62.04
to
77.52)]
(Supplementary Table 4). As above, the significantly smal-
ler b-amplitude derived from the a-wave (Fig. 2B, E, H and
Supplementary Table 4).
In the dark-adapted rod ERG , the b-wave amplitude
generated by green light was significantly smaller than
those
generated
by blue and white,
and significantly
larger than those generated by amber and red (Fig. 2C,
F, I and Supplementary Table 5).
Collectively, these ERGs suggest that activation of cone-
mediated (but not rod) retinal pathways can play a role in
the weak ‘photophobic’ effects of green and strong ‘photo-
phobic’ effects of white, blue and red.
Multi-unit recording of responses to
different colours of light in the rat
thalamus
To determine how differences in cone responses to blue,
white and green lights are processed by thalamic neurons
that constitute the second limb of the retino-thalamo-
cortical pathway for exacerbation of headache by light
(Noseda et al., 2010), we recorded simultaneously from
dura-sensitive, dura-insensitive, light-sensitive and light-in-
sensitive neurons in lateral posterior (LP), posterior (Po)
and ventral posteromedial (VPM) nuclei. The stimulation
paradigm included mechanical stimulation of the dura in a
dimly lit room, followed by 15 min of darkness for estab-
lishing baseline activity, and then four stimulation cycles
(dark-light-dark, 1-min each) in the same order (white-
blue-green-red) and at the same maximal value of intensity
(100 cd�m�2) used in the human psychophysical studies
(Supplementary Fig. 3).
In six experiments we were successful in simultaneously
recording and isolating 97 thalamic neurons. Of these, 24
were dura-sensitive (10 Po, eight LP, six VPM), 73 dura-
insensitive (27 Po, 25 LP, 21 VPM), 37 light-sensitive (13
Po, 20 LP, four VPM), and 60 light-insensitive (24 Po, 13
LP, 23 VPM) (Fig. 3A and B). These 97 neurons were
exposed to 140 stimulation cycles of white, 249 stimulation
cycles of blue, 188 stimulation cycles of green, and 192
stimulation cycles of red (Fig. 4A, C and E). Analysis of
firing frequency [mean spikes/s � standard error of the
mean (SEM)] recorded in all 97 neurons during the 769
stimulation cycles showed that exposure to blue and white
lights significantly increased neuronal activity (blue, from
1.07 � 0.12 to 1.58 � 0.16 spikes/s, P 5 0.0001, n = 249;
white, from 1.29 � 0.19 to 1.71 � 0.29 spikes/s P = 0.011,
n = 140), whereas exposure to green light did not (green,
from
1.13 � 0.17
to
1.29 � 0.17

P = 0.395,
n = 188)—adding mechanistic support to the clinical obser-
vation

Bar graphs showing only those trials in which lights altered pain perception. Note that all colours but green increased pain ratings by a maximum
of 15–20% (0–10 VAS), whereas green—the only colour to decrease pain ratings—attenuated the pain by a maximum of 15%. (D) Pain rating
differences (from baseline) grew larger with increasing stimulus intensity, such that differences in response to green light were significantly smaller
as compared to all other colours at all intensities (top, mean � 95% CI). Analysed regardless of stimulus intensity (colour-intensity interaction was
statistically insignificant), all colours but green demonstrated a significant increase in pain ratings compared to baseline (bottom, P 5 0.0001 for
each colour). (E) Number of patients who experienced muscle tenderness and throbbing during exposure to light compared to no such
perception at baseline. (F) Effect of colours on spread of headache from its original location (grey areas). Cases in which the headache affected

 ‘photophobic’ responses (Fig. 4). Because red light did not
activate
thalamic
neurons
(red,
from
1.18 � 0.15
to
1.16 � 0.15 spikes/s, P = 0.486, n = 192), we excluded
trials with red light from further analyses.
Analysis of responses to white, blue and green in each of
the three thalamic nuclei revealed significant sensitivity to
these
colours
of
light
in
LP
(from
1.69 � 0.26
to
2.33 � 0.3 spikes/s, P 5 0.0001, n = 181) and Po (from
1.35 � 0.1 to 1.86 � 0.19 spikes/s, P = 0.025, n = 177), but
not in VPM (from 0.53 � 0.04 to 0.57 � 0.04 spikes/s,
P = 0.138, n = 219) (Fig. 4B, D, F and G). Because no
colour of light significantly increased the response magnitude
of VPM neurons (white, from 0.32 � 0.07 to 0.38 � 0.07;
blue,
from
0.64 � 0.07
to
0.7 � 0.07;
green,
from
0.46 � 0.06
to
0.45 � 0.06;
red,
from
0.6 � 0.07
to
0.49 � 0.06 spikes/s), they were excluded from further ana-
lyses (Fig. 4E–J).
Comparisons between responses to blue, green and white
within LP and within Po, which was based on firing fre-
quency analysis of 92 stimulation cycles recorded in the
light-sensitive neurons, showed that the response to blue
light was significantly larger than the response to green
light in both LP (P = 0.019) and Po (P = 0.042), and signifi-
cantly larger than the response to white light in LP
(P = 0.046) but not in Po (P = 0.461) (Fig. 4H). The analysis
also showed that the response to white light was signifi-
cantly larger than the response to green light in Po
(P = 0.006) but not in LP (P = 0.850) (Fig. 4H).
Dura-sensitive
neurons
demonstrated
a
significantly
greater
(2–3-fold)
response
probability
to
white
[P = 0.013,
odds
ratio
(OR) = 4.60],
blue
(P = 0.002,
OR = 4.61) and green (P = 0.023, OR = 3.56) lights, as
compared to dura-insensitive neurons (Fig. 4I). Among
the dura-sensitive neurons, those located in LP demon-
strated a significantly greater (2–3-fold) response probabil-
ity to blue, as compared to those located in Po (P = 0.023,
OR = 12.20) (Fig. 4J). Further demonstrating the likelihood
that dura-sensitive LP neurons mediate the aversion to blue
light is the finding that within LP, all dura-sensitive neurons
responded to blue, but only half responded to white, and
about a third to green (Fig. 4J). In contrast, the probability
of neuronal response to white and green were comparable
in these two nuclei (white: P = 0.7, OR = 2.22, green:
P = 1.0, OR = 1.37).

 Visual evoked potential studies in
migraineurs
As perceptions of pain, light and colour are created in the
cortex, we also sought to determine whether the psycho-
physical findings that (i) green evoked the least ‘photopho-
bic’ responses; and (ii) blue, amber and red elicited the most
‘photophobic’ responses, could be expressed in the magni-
tude of the activity recorded in the cortex. To address these
questions, the same 43 patients who underwent ERGs,
underwent a standard flash visual evoked potential (Odom
et al., 2010), first with white light and then with blue, green,
amber and red (see ‘Materials and methods’ section and
Supplementary Fig. 4). Of these, only 28 patients yielded
reliable and reproducible visual evoked potential signals (fur-
ther explanation in methods). Analysis of the P2 amplitude
values (median � 95% CI), measured from 0 to P2 peak,
based on 8960 flashes of light recorded successfully in 28
patients (28 � 5 colours � 64 flashes of each colour) re-
vealed that green [11.14 mV (9.09 to 12.76)] was signifi-
cantly
smaller
than
blue
[14.2 mV
(11.36
to
17.24),
P = 0.016], red [13.51mV (9.54 to 17.48), P = 0.02], and
amber [15.54mV (10.28 to 18.12), P = 0.002] (Fig. 5A–C
and Supplementary Table 6). In contrast, N2 amplitude
values showed no significant differences (Supplementary
Table 6). Reassuring the validity of the visual evoked poten-
tial recording were the findings that the median N2 and P2
latencies of the different colours of light were similar (ran-
ging between 77.79 and 79.87ms for N2, and between
114.4
and
117.3 ms
for
P2;

Discussion
The study reveals a mechanism for the novel finding that
exposure to green light exacerbates migraine headache sig-
nificantly less than exposure to white, blue, amber or red
lights in patients with normal eyesight. Taking into consid-
eration results of ERG, thalamic and visual evoked poten-
tial
recordings,
the
findings
suggest
that
migraine
photophobia may originate in the retina and fine-tuned in
the thalamus, rather than in the cortex—a major shift in
current thinking. Mechanistically, the psychophysical find-
ings are explained by the differential responses of cone-
driven retinal pathways, light-sensitive thalamic neurons
in two sensory nuclei outside the main visual pathway,
and the cortex to the different colours. Therapeutically,
filtering out all but green light may prove beneficial for
the reduction of photophobia and potentially the headache
intensity.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
compare the impact that different colours of light have on
headache intensity in migraineurs undergoing acute mi-
graine attacks. It is also the first study to use a technology
that allows photic stimuli to be delivered at a narrow band
of wavelengths and a single luminous intensity (cd�s�m�2).
Outside migraine attacks, Main and colleagues (2000) re-
ported that the discomfort threshold of migraineurs is
lower
when
exposed
to
low
(380–530 nm)
and
high
(580–730 nm) compared to medium (430–630 nm) wave-
length of lights, and Good et al. (1991) found that glasses
that filter blue light reduce migraine frequency (but not
sensitivity to light) in children. These studies, although car-
ried out interictally, and with far less precision regarding
the range of wavelengths allowed in each of the three sti-
muli, support the findings that migraineurs are more sensi-
tive to blue and red, as compared to green light.
Exploring potential mechanisms for colour preference, we
first sought to determine whether the relative amplitude
of the signals that the retina generates in response to
each of the colours could be the cause of this phenomenon.
Using the standard light-adapted single flash and flickering
ERG paradigms (McCulloch et al., 2015), we found that
the a-wave amplitude generated by green light was smaller
than the a-wave amplitude generated by blue, red and
white lights, and that the a-wave amplitude generated by
blue light was significantly larger than the a-wave ampli-
tude generated by white, green, amber and red. Because, in
the light-adapted flash ERG, the negative deflection of the
a-wave originates from activation of cones (Brown and
Wiesel, 1961a, b; Brown and Murakami, 1964; Penn and
Hagins, 1969) and the peak and positive deflection reflect
activity in ON- and OFF-bipolar and horizontal cells in the
post-receptor retina (Miller and Dowling, 1970; Newman,
1980; Fulton and Hansen, 1988; Shirato et al., 2008; Abd-
El-Barr et al., 2009; Miura et al., 2009; Robson and
Frishman, 2014), we propose that photophobia could ori-
ginate in cone-driven retinal pathways—at the very begin-
ning of the newly described non-image-forming visual
pathway for exacerbation of headache by light (Noseda
et al., 2010, 2011). Because the a-wave discussed above
was recorded under conditions that saturate the rod

 system (background illumination) (Hood and Finkelstein,
1986) and at frequency that was too fast for rods to
follow (428 Hz) (Dodt, 1951; Conner and MacLeod,
1977), we concluded that rods are unlikely to contribute
to the ‘photophobic’ experience.
In line with our recently-described retino-thalamo-cortical
pathway for migraine-type photophobia (Noseda et al.,
2010), we then determined whether the response magni-
tudes and firing probability of light-sensitive thalamic neu-
rons in LP and Po (which constitute the ‘thalamo’ portion
of the pathway) reflect or alter the different signals they
receive from the retina, and whether their response charac-
teristics could help explain why green light is least photo-
phobic. Our simultaneous recording of multiple neurons in
the three thalamic nuclei revealed that green generated the
smallest responses in LP and Po, that blue generated the
largest response in LP but not in Po, that white generated
responses that are smaller than blue in LP and larger than
green in Po, that VPM neurons are generally non-respon-
sive

(� SEM) across patients in response to 1792 flashes (64 flashes per patient, 1 s interstimulus interval) of each colour of light. The VEPs to flash
stimulation consists of a series of negative and positive waves, the most robust of which are the N2 and P2 peaks. (B) Superimposed means of
these flash VEPs demonstrated that blue, red and amber generated significantly larger P2 amplitude (enlarged view in inset) as compared to green
(P 5 0.02). In contrast, no differences were found in the amplitudes of the N2 waves. (C) Boxplot illustrating median (thick horizontal white line),

 neurons, dura-sensitive neurons are two to three times
more likely to respond to light. Although we cannot com-
ment on responses to red and amber lights, these findings
establish the principle that the ‘most photophobic’ blue
light activates more neurons and generates a greater mag-
nitude of response than the ‘least photophobic’ green light
and that white light, which is more ‘photophobic’ than
green (and potentially less aversive than blue), activates
neurons more robustly than green but less robustly than
blue. Mechanistically, the findings suggest that both LP
and Po neurons mediate the non-aversive reaction to
green, that LP and to a lesser extent Po mediate the pref-
erential aversion to blue, and that the distinction between
white and green occurs in Po.
Finally, as human perception is established in the cortex,
we also determined whether the magnitude of the electrical
signals generated in the cortex by the different colours of
light correlates with the subjective perception that green is
less ‘photophobic’ than blue, amber, red and white; the dis-
tinguishably small ERG signals induced by green; and the
relatively weak ability of green light to induce firing in the
thalamic neurons. Using the standard flash visual evoked
potential (Odom et al., 2010), we found that the P2 ampli-
tude generated by green was significantly smaller than the
amplitudes
generated
by
blue,
amber
and
red.
What
prompted us to consider the P2 deflection as a meaningful
response was the observation that regardless of the colour of
light, it appeared stable across the 64 trials. At face value,
these results can explain migraineurs’ perception that green
light is the least photophobic. However, as the neural source
of the P2 deflection is unknown (Mehta et al., 2000a, b),
caution must be practiced in interpreting the findings. In the
context of our study, there seems to be agreement that the
P2 originates in the parieto-occipital region (Freunberger
et al., 2007), that it represents higher-order perceptual pro-
cessing, and that it reflects complex neural processes that
occur when a visual input is compared with an internal rep-
resentation and stored memory (Luck and Hillyard, 1994;
Evans and Federmeier, 2007; Freunberger et al., 2007).
While the presented data are compelling, suggestions that
cortical processing of photophobia may differ in classical
versus common migraine (Cucchiara et al., 2015) call atten-
tion to the need to repeat this study paradigm in different
subpopulations of migraineurs, (i.e. episodic, chronic, with
aura,
without
aura,
in
post-traumatic
headache,
etc.).
Insufficient number of patients limited our ability to perform
such comparisons in the current study. Along this line, it may
also be interesting to determine effects of the stimulation
paradigms used in this study on healthy control subjects.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that green light is
least likely to exacerbate migraine headache and that at
low intensities it may even be therapeutic by reducing the
headache intensity. The soothing effects of green are likely
to involve a complex psychobiology (Hurlbert and Ling,
2007; Palmer and Schloss, 2010; Strauss et al., 2013).
Mechanistically, we propose that migraine photophobia
can originate in cone-driven retinal pathways and is relayed
through light-sensitive trigeminovascular thalamic neurons
to the cortex, where patients’ perception is highly corre-
lated with the P2 waveform of the visual evoked potential.
