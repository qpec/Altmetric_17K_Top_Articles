Sensitization, Asthma, and Hay Fever

abstract
BACKGROUND: The hygiene hypothesis suggests that early-life exposure to microbial organisms 
reduces the risk of developing allergies. Thumb-sucking and nail-biting are common 
childhood habits that may increase microbial exposures. We tested the hypothesis that 
children who suck their thumbs or bite their nails have a lower risk of developing atopy, 
asthma, and hay fever in a population-based birth cohort followed to adulthood.
METHODS: Parents reported children’s thumb-sucking and nail-biting habits when their 
children were ages 5, 7, 9, and 11 years. Atopic sensitization was defined as a positive skin-
prick test (≥2-mm weal) to ≥1 common allergen at 13 and 32 years. Associations between 
thumb-sucking and nail-biting in childhood, and atopic sensitization, asthma, and hay fever 
at these ages were assessed by using logistic regression with adjustments for sex and other 
potential confounding factors: parental atopy, breastfeeding, pet ownership, household 
crowding, socioeconomic status, and parental smoking.
RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of children were frequent thumb-suckers or nail-biters at ≥1 
of the ages. These children had a lower risk of atopic sensitization at age 13 years (odds 
ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.48–0.92, P = .013) and age 32 years (odds ratio 0.61, 
95% confidence interval 0.46–0.81, P = .001). These associations persisted when adjusted 
for multiple confounding factors. Children who had both habits had a lower risk of atopic 
sensitization than those who had only 1. No associations were found for nail-biting, thumb-
sucking, and asthma or hay fever at either age.
CONCLUSIONS: Children who suck their thumbs or bite their nails are less likely to have atopic 
sensitization in childhood and adulthood.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: The hygiene 
hypothesis suggests that childhood exposure to 
microbial organisms reduces the risk of developing 
allergic diseases. The effects of thumb-sucking and 
nail-biting habits are likely to increase microbial 
exposure, but their effects on allergic diseases are 
unknown.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Children who sucked their 
thumbs or bit their nails between ages 5 and 11 
years were less likely to have atopic sensitization at 
age 13. This reduced risk persisted until adulthood. 
There was no association with asthma or hay fever.

LYNCH et al 
The “hygiene hypothesis” was 
suggested by Strachan 
1 to explain 
why children from larger families 
and those with older siblings are 
less likely to develop hay fever. 
Strachan 
1 hypothesized that this 
could be explained if “allergic 
diseases were prevented by infection 
in early childhood transmitted 
by unhygienic contact with older 
siblings, or acquired prenatally from 
a mother infected by contact with 
her older children.” The hypothesis 
is supported by evidence showing 
that children who grow up in large 
families are at greater risk of coming 
into contact with more infections, 
promoting T helper (TH)-1 immune 
responses, whereas children from 
smaller families are more likely to 
have TH-2 type responses and a 
higher risk of atopy. 
2 The hygiene 
hypothesis remains controversial, 
however, as it is unable to fully 
explain many associations, including 
the rise of allergies in “unhygienic” 
inner-city environments, and 
why probiotics are ineffective at 
preventing allergic diseases. 
3
Thumb-sucking and nail-biting 
are common oral habits among 
children, although the reported 
prevalence varies widely, from <1% 
to 25%. 
4 
 
– 
7 These habits have the 
potential to increase the exposure 
to environmental microorganisms, 
and have been associated with the 
oral carriage of Enterobacteriaceae, 
such as Escherichia coli and intestinal 
parasite infections.8 
 
 
– 
12 It seems 
likely that thumb-sucking and 
nail-biting would introduce a wide 
variety of microbes into the body, 
thus increasing the diversity of the 
child’s microbiome. If the hygiene 
hypothesis is correct, it is plausible 
that this would influence the risk 
for allergies. There is currently no 
evidence as to whether thumb-
sucking and nail-biting influence 
immune function or risk for allergy. 
A recent study found that infants 
whose mothers “cleaned” their 
pacifiers by sucking them clean 
were less likely to develop asthma 
and eczema.13 They concluded that 
immune stimulation secondary to the 
exchange of maternal oral bacteria 
might protect against atopy. We 
hypothesized that the introduction 
of microbes by thumb-sucking and 
nail-biting would influence children’s 
immune responses and reduce the 
risk of developing allergies.
We investigated the effect of 
thumb-sucking and nail-biting in 
childhood on the development of 
atopic sensitization, asthma, and 
hay fever among participants of the 
Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and 
Development Study, a prospective 
longitudinal population-based birth 
cohort study followed to age 38 
years.
METHODS
The Dunedin Multidisciplinary 
Health and Development Study is a 
population-based birth cohort study 
of 1037 participants (52% male 
participants) born in Dunedin in 
1972–1973. Dunedin is a coastal city 
of ∼120 000 inhabitants including 
the surrounding rural areas. The 
cohort represents the full range of 
socioeconomic status in the South 
Island of New Zealand, and the 
study participants are mostly of 
New Zealand European ethnicity. 
Follow-up assessments were 
completed at ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 
15, 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 years. A full 
description of the study is reported 
elsewhere. 
14 The Otago Ethics 
Committee approved the study, 
and written informed consent was 
obtained at each assessment.
Thumb-Sucking and Nail-Biting
When the study members were age 
5, 7, 9, and 11 years, parents were 
asked about their child’s thumb-
sucking and nail-biting status. 
Parents were asked if the statements 
“frequently sucks their finger/
thumb” and “frequently bites their 
nails” applied to their child. They 
could choose from 3 responses: not at 
all, somewhat, or certainly. Children 
were considered to be frequent 
thumb-suckers or nail-biters if their 
parents reported that the oral habit 
in question “certainly” applied to 
them at least once.
Atopic Sensitization
Skin-prick testing was first 
undertaken at age 13 years on 
70% (724 of 1031) of the study 
members. Allergens tested included 
house dust mite (Dermatophagoides 
pteronyssinus; Bencard, Brentford, 
UK), grass, cat, dog, horse, kapok, 
wool, Aspergillus fumigatus, 
Alternaria, Penicillium, 
 and 
Cladosporium (Hollister-Stier, 
Spokane, WA). At age 32 years, skin-
prick tests were repeated in 93% 
(946 of 1015) of the participants 
by using the same allergens, 
but obtained from a different 
manufacturer (ALK, supplied by 
Allergy Canada, Thornhill, Ontario, 
Canada), with the addition of 
cockroach. A positive response to 
a skin-prick test was defined by a 
wheal diameter at least 2 mm larger 
than the negative saline control. 
Atopic sensitization was defined as 
having ≥1 positive response to an 
allergen. 
15
Asthma and Hay Fever
Detailed respiratory assessments 
have been conducted since age 
9 using previously developed 
questionnaires. 
16 Participants were 
considered to have current asthma if 
they reported a diagnosis of asthma 
and had compatible symptoms 
or treatment in the previous 
12 months. 
17 Participants were 
considered to have current hay fever 
if this was reported at age 13 or 32 
years.
Control Variables
A number of potential confounders 
known to be associated with 
atopic sensitization in this cohort 
were considered, including sex

and parental history. 
18 The parent 
attending with the child at age 7 
years was asked whether either 
parent had asthma or hay fever. This 
information was supplemented with 
information obtained from the study 
members themselves at age 18 years. 
If either parent had a history of atopy 
or asthma, the child was considered 
to have a parental history of atopy. 
19 
At age 3 years, the child’s mother 
was asked about the initiation 
and duration of breastfeeding. In 
most cases this was verified from 
prospective visiting nurse records. 
Children were considered to be 
breastfed if breastfeeding continued 
for ≥4 weeks. 
20 Cat and dog 
ownership from birth to age 9 years 
was reported from parental recall 
at age 9 years. Previous analyses of 
this cohort found that those exposed 
to both a cat and a dog during 
childhood had a lower risk of atopic 
sensitization; therefore, owning both 
animals was considered a potential 
confounder. 
21 A sensitivity analysis 
included ownership of each animal 
separately. Parental smoking history 
was obtained from a parent when 
the child was aged 7, 9, and 11 
years. At aged 13 years, the study 
members themselves were also 
asked about their parents’ smoking 
status. Participants were regarded as 
being exposed to parental smoking 
if either parent smoked at any of 
these ages.19 An index of household 
crowding was developed according 
to the total number of children in 
the house at the assessment at 3 
years, divided by the number of 
rooms (excluding kitchens and 
bathrooms; R.J.H., unpublished data). 
The socioeconomic status (SES) 
of the families was classified on a 
6-point scale based on the income 
and education levels associated with 
parental occupations using data from 
the New Zealand Census. The average 
of the families’ SES over multiple 
assessments between birth and age 
13 years was used for analysis. 
22
Statistical Analysis
Associations between thumb-sucking 
or nail-biting during childhood 
and atopic sensitization, asthma, 
and hay fever at age 13 years were 
assessed by using binary logistic 
regression. Atopic sensitization, 
asthma, or hay fever at age 13 years 
were the dependent variables, and 
the presence of either oral habit 
(thumb-sucking or nail-biting) 
status was the main predictor. Initial 
logistic regression analyses assessed 
whether the effects of oral habits 
differed between sexes by testing 
for sex-by-oral habit interactions. 
These were not significant and 
therefore both sexes were analyzed 
together, with an adjustment for 
sex. Further analyses also adjusted 
for parental atopy, breastfeeding, 
cat and dog ownership, parental 
smoking, household crowding, and 
socioeconomic status. To assess 
whether the oral habits had different 
effects on sensitization to different 
allergens, additional analyses 
were performed for the 3 most 
common sensitizing allergens in this 
cohort: house dust mite, grass, 
and cat. 
15
To assess whether any association 
between thumb-sucking or nail-biting 
and atopic sensitization, asthma, or 
hay fever persisted into adulthood, 
these analyses were repeated for age 
32 years. Analyses were performed 
by using Stata 13 (Stata Corp, College 
Station, TX). P < .05 was considered 
statistically significant. Analyses used 
all available data.
RESULTS
Of 1013 children providing data, 
317 (31%) had ≥1 oral habit: there 
was no significant sex difference in 
prevalence of these habits ( 
Table 1).
Of the 724 children who had skin-
prick tests at age 13 years, 328 
(45%) showed atopic sensitization. 
The prevalence of sensitization was 
lower among children who had an 
oral habit (38%) compared with 
those who did not (49%) (P = .009). 
The lower risk of atopic sensitization 
was similar for thumb-sucking and 
nail-biting. Children with only 1 
habit were less likely to be atopic 
(40%) than children with no habit 
at all (49%), but those with both 
habits had the lowest prevalence of 
sensitization (31%) ( 
Fig 1). The trend 
in atopic sensitization across those 
with neither, 1, or both of these oral 
habits was statistically significant: 
P = .005.
The associations between oral habits 
and atopic sensitization remained 
significant in logistic regression 
analyses adjusting for sex, and after 
further adjustment for parental 
atopy, breastfeeding, cat and dog 
ownership, parental smoking, 
household crowding, and SES. 
Repeating the analyses examining 
cat and dog ownership separately 
did not materially affect the findings 
(data not shown). Further analyses 
of individual oral habits on their 
own showed a significant association 
between thumb-sucking and atopy 
at age 13 years. Nail-biting also was 
associated with lower risk of atopic

sensitization at age 13 years when 
adjusted for sex, but this was of 
borderline statistical significance 
when multiply adjusted ( 
Table 2). 
Overall, children manifesting 1 or 
both of these oral habits had ∼30% 
to 40% reduction in the risk of atopic 
sensitization across all analyses, 
whether statistically significant or of 
borderline significance.
Thumb-sucking and nail-biting 
also were associated with a lower 
prevalence of atopic sensitization 
in both sex-adjusted and multiply-
adjusted analyses at age 32 years 
( 
Table 2). The pattern of findings 
was similar for both thumb-sucking 
and nail-biting when considered 
individually, but these associations 
were of borderline statistical 
significance in the multiply-adjusted 
analyses.
None of the associations between 
oral habits and atopic sensitization 
to specific allergens (house 
dust mite, cat, and grass) were 
statistically significant in sex-
adjusted analyses at age 13, but 
all of these associations were 
significant at age 32 years. In the 
multiply-adjusted analyses, there 
were no significant associations 
at age 13, whereas at age 32 the 
reduced odds of house dust mite 
sensitization remained significant 
but the associations with grass and 
cat sensitization were of borderline 
statistical significance ( 
Table 3).

Sensitivity analyses using a 3-mm 
cutpoint to define a positive skin-
prick test showed a similar pattern of 
findings with a significant reduction 
in sensitization at both ages 13 and 
32 (sex-adjusted odds ratios [ORs]: 
0.63 [P = .007] and 0.56 [P < .001], 
respectively). Children who had 
sucked their thumbs or bit their 
nails in childhood had a lower total 
number positive skin-prick tests 
at age 13 than those who had not 
(Wilcoxon rank sum test: P = .0297) 
and the sum of weal sizes across 
all 11 skin-prick tests was also less 
among those who had an oral habit 
in childhood (P = .043). Similarly, by 
age 32 those who had sucked their 
thumbs or bit their nails had fewer 
positive skin-prick tests (P < .001) 
and the sum of all 12 weal sizes was 
lower than among those who had not 
(P < .001).
At age 13 years, 95 (12.9%) of 735 
children were asthmatic and 219 
(29.8%) of 735 children reported 
current hay fever ( 
Table 1). There 
was no evidence that oral habits 
in childhood were associated 
with asthma (13.3% vs 12.8% for 
those with and without oral habits 
respectively: P = .8) or hay fever 
(29.6% vs 29.9%: P = .9) at age 13 
years. Nor was there a significant 
association with specific habits 
( 
Fig 1). There were no statistically 
significant associations between 
thumb-sucking and nail-biting and 
asthma or hay fever at ages 13 or 
32 years in either sex-adjusted or 
multiply-adjusted analyses ( 
Tables 4 
and  
5).
DISCUSSION
The findings from this study support 
our hypothesis that children who 
frequently suck their thumbs or 
bite their nails have a lower risk 
of developing atopic sensitization. 
Children who were reported to 
have either of these habits were 
less likely to have positive skin-
prick tests at age 13 years and this 
apparent protective effect persisted 
to age 32 years. These associations 
were independent of sex, a parental 
history of atopy, and a variety of 
environmental factors known to be 
associated with atopic sensitization 
within this cohort.
There also appeared to be a dose-
response relationship for atopic 
sensitization at age 13: those who 
had both oral habits had a lower 
incidence of atopic sensitization 
than those who had only 1 (Fig 1). 
This dose-response was not 
apparent at age 32, however (not 
shown). When habits were assessed 
individually, it appeared that 
thumb-sucking and nail-biting had 
similar associations with reduced 
prevalence of atopic sensitization; 
however, when multiply-adjusted, 
nail-biting on its own did not reach 
statistical significance ( 
Table 2). Post 
hoc analyses showed little evidence

at just 1 age. Nor did we find that 
the association was substantially 
different for different ages, with 
the exception that oral habits at 
age 11 appeared to have weaker 
associations with a reduced risk of 
sensitization.
By contrast, we did not find any 
association between thumb-sucking 
and nail-biting with asthma or hay 
fever at either age 13 or 32 years. 
The reasons for this inconsistency 
are unclear. Although asthma and 
hay fever are often associated with 
atopy, there are other contributing 
factors. Only approximately one-third 
of childhood asthma is attributable to 
atopy in this and other studies. 
23 The 
development of asthma is less clearly 
linked to immune function than 
atopy. 
24 In addition, both asthma and 
hay fever were based on reported 
diagnoses and symptoms and are 
therefore more subjective than the 
outcomes of skin-prick tests.
The findings of this study are 
consistent with those of the pacifier 
study by Hesselmar et al, 
 
13 who 
found that children whose mothers 
sucked their pacifiers clean were less 
likely to develop allergies. Although 
the mechanism and age of exposure 
are different, both studies suggest 
that the immune response and risk 
of allergies may be influenced by 
exposure to oral bacteria or other 
microbes. It is known that the gut 
microbiome can alter the function of 
TH cell subsets and thereby influence 
TH-1 and TH-2 responses and the 
development of immune tolerance. 
25 
Our findings lend support to the 
hygiene hypothesis that avoiding oral 
environmental microbial exposures 
increases the risk for allergic 
sensitization to inhaled allergens.
Strengths of this study include 
multiple assessments of exposure in 
a large population-based cohort of 
children with a high rate of follow-up. 
We are able to adjust for a wide 
range of potential environmental 
and familial confounding factors. We 
have data on thumb-sucking and nail-
biting habits only during primary 
school ages (5–11 years) and not for 
the preschool years and we do not 
know whether children had already 
developed atopic sensitization before 
information on these oral habits was 
gathered. However, it seems unlikely 
that childhood sensitization would 
influence subsequent thumb-sucking 
and nail-biting habits. Hence, we 
believe that the findings are unlikely 
to be explained by reverse causation. 
In addition, our primary outcome 
measure, atopic sensitization, was 
objectively assessed by skin-prick 
tests. Habit status, however, was 
based on parental reports and 
there will be some errors in these. 
Although only those who “certainly” 
sucked their thumbs or bit their 
nails frequently were considered 
to be exposed, some parents may 
have been unwilling to report that 
their child sucked his or her thumb, 
or bit his or her nails. The choice of 
answers provided to the parents, “not 
at all, 
” “somewhat, 
” and “certainly, 
” are also open to interpretation by 
the individual. However, it seems 
unlikely that misreporting would 
be systematically different between 
parents whose children did or did 
not have atopic sensitization, and 
nondifferential reporting errors 
would tend to bias the associations 
toward the null value. A limitation 
is that at age 13 years, only 70% of 
the participants consented to skin-
prick tests; however, those who were 
not tested at age 13 had a similar 
prevalence of atopic sensitization 
at age 32 years compared with 
those who were tested (56% vs 60% 
P = .22). 
19
Thumb-sucking and nail-biting are 
often seen as undesirable habits and 
are discouraged by many parents, 
 
26 
and numerous studies have assessed 
interventions to stop these habits. 
27 
There is some evidence that these 
habits are associated with dental 
malocclusion 
28 
–30 and gingival 
injury, 
 
31 and that they can also 
cause local hand infections. 
32 
– 
34 
Spontaneous correction of some oral 
malocclusions can occur if thumb-
sucking habits are stopped before 
dental development progresses, 
35, 
 
36 
but there is limited research on the 
long-term effects of these habits on 
oral health. Our findings suggest that 
these habits also may have some 
beneficial effects: although we did 
not find an impact of these habits on 
asthma or hay fever, the reduction 
in atopic sensitization may have 
long-term health benefits. Further 
investigation of the long-term 
effects of these childhood habits is 
warranted.
To our knowledge this is the first 
study to explore the association 
between the effects of thumb-sucking 
and nail-biting and the prevalence 
of atopic sensitization and asthma. 
We found that there was a lower 
prevalence of atopic sensitization 
among teenagers and adults who had 
had these habits during childhood. 
These results contribute to the 
body of evidence supporting the 
hygiene hypothesis. Although we 
do not suggest that children should 
be encouraged to take up these oral 
habits, the findings suggest that 
thumb-sucking and nail-biting reduce 
the risk for developing sensitization 
to common aeroallergens.
