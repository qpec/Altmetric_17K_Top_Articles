1 | BACKGROUND
Reducing sickness absence is high on health care employers’ agenda, 
in the context of staff shortages and the adverse effect on over‐
all productivity and costs (Johnson, Croghan, & Crawford, 2003; 
Letvak & Buck, 2008; NHS Employers, 2014). Sickness absence is 
costly to the economy; figures from England’s NHS put costs of 
staff absence due to poor health at £2.4 bn a year, accounting for 
around £1 in every £40 of the total budget (The Health Foundation, 
2015). Furthermore, high rates of absenteeism among health care 
staff have been associated with lower patient satisfaction (Duclay, 
Hardouin, Sebille, Anthoine, & Moret, 2015).

Objective: To investigate whether working 12 hr shifts is associated with increased 
sickness absence among registered nurses and health care assistants.
Background: Previous studies reported negative impacts on nurses’ 12 hr shifts; 
however, these studies used cross‐sectional techniques and subjective nurse‐re‐
ported data.
Methods: A retrospective longitudinal study using routinely collected data across 32 
general inpatient wards at an acute hospital in England. We used generalized linear 
mixed models to explore the association between shift patterns and the subsequent 
occurrence of short (<7 days) or long‐term (≥7 days) sickness absence.
Results: We analysed 601,282 shifts and 8,090 distinct episodes of sickness ab‐
sence. When more than 75% of shifts worked in the past 7 days were 12 hr in length, 
the odds of both a short‐term (adjusted odds ratio = 1.28; 95% confidence index: 
1.18–1.39) and long‐term sickness episode (adjusted odds ratio = 1.22; 95% confi‐
dence index: 1.08–1.37) were increased compared with working none.
Conclusion: Working long shifts on hospital wards is associated with a higher risk of 
sickness absence for registered nurses and health care assistants.
Implications for Nursing Management: The higher sickness absence rates associated 
with long shifts could result in additional costs or loss of productivity for hospitals. 
The routine implementation of long shifts should be avoided.

DALL’ORA et AL.
Workplace factors have been shown to play a significant role in 
increasing sickness absence (Hahtela et al., 2015; National Institute 
for Health & Care Excellence, 2008). Among these factors, aspects 
of shift work, such as long shifts have been associated with de‐
creases in employees’ well‐being and increases in sickness absence 
(Fekedulegn et al., 2013; Michie & Williams, 2003). A systematic re‐
view found limited evidence for the effect of aspects of shift work 
on sickness absence, concluding that evening work was associated 
with higher sickness absence levels (Merkus et al., 2012).
While the effects of shift work are typically job specific, there is an 
emerging body of evidence suggesting that long shifts in hospital wards 
may have adverse effects on staff, such as higher job dissatisfaction, 
burnout and intention to leave the job (Dall’Ora et al., 2015; Stimpfel 
& Aiken, 2013; Stimpfel, Brewer, & Kovner, 2015; Stimpfel, Sloane, & 
Aiken, 2012). Nonetheless, there is a trend toward the increasing use 
of long shifts for nursing staff on hospital wards (Merrifield, 2017a). 
These shifts are often adopted because of perceived efficiencies and 
to compensate for staff shortages (NHS Evidence, 2010).
There are recurring limitations of shift work research published 
to date: previous research has relied almost entirely on self‐report 
measures (Dall’Ora et al., 2016; Harma et al., 2015). However, self‐
reported data do not correlate well with administrative records of 
sickness absence (Gaudine & Gregory, 2010; Grovle et al., 2012). 
Furthermore, a major limitation of previous shift work studies, being 
mostly cross‐sectional, has been the inability to meet a basic re‐
quirement for causal inference—demonstrating that cause precedes 
effect (Antonakis, Bendahan, Jacquart, & Lalive, 2010). Thus, it re‐
mains unclear whether there is any causal link between long shifts 
and objective sickness absence and the trend toward the increas‐
ing use of long shifts for nursing staff on hospital wards continues 
(Merrifield, 2017a).
Longitudinal studies that are able to capture the impact of dif‐
ferent shift characteristics and to make use of formal records of 
sickness absence are needed. Therefore, the aim of this study was 
to examine the extent to which shift patterns are associated with 
sickness absence within a sample of nursing staff working on hos‐
pital wards.
2 | METHODS
This was a retrospective longitudinal observational study using 
routinely collected data on nursing staff, shift data and sickness ab‐
sence data. Within England’s NHS hospitals, the nursing workforce 
is composed of registered nurses (RN) and variously titled health 
care assistants or health care support workers (HCA) who provide 
“hands on” care. The study took place in all inpatient general adult 
wards (32 wards) in a large acute care hospital trust in the South 
of England. The data examined for this study were derived from a 
larger parent study (ISRCTN registration: 17930973 http://www.is‐
rctn.com/ISRCTN17930973). The University of Southampton Ethics 
Committee granted ethical approval to undertake this research 
(Submission Number 18,311).
2.1 | Data extraction
Data on all shifts scheduled for RNs and HCAs over a 3‐year pe‐
riod (April 2012 to 31 March 2015) were extracted directly from a 
hospital‐wide electronic system (E‐Roster) that feeds into the pay‐
roll system. Data were also extracted for additional shifts worked in 
the same hospital by staff beyond their contracted hours. Both data 
sources were combined to achieve a record of all shifts worked on 
the study wards by all registered nurses and health care assistants 
employed in the hospital. Data were pseudo‐anonymized so shifts 
worked by the same individual could be linked, but no personal iden‐
tifiable information were shared with the research team.
2.2 | Outcome measures
Episodes of sickness absence were obtained from the appropriate 
records coded in the electronic rostering system. We also included 
absence recorded as “unauthorized” as these could include sickness 
periods when the proper reporting procedure was not followed, al‐
though the absolute number of such episodes was very low (n = 360, 
less than 1% of absences).
We considered that a sickness episode started on the first day the 
employee was absent from work and finished as soon as the employee 
went back to work for at least one shift. If the sickness absence in‐
volved 7 or more days of consecutive absence from work, including 
non‐working days, it was defined as long‐term sickness absence; if it 
was shorter than 7 consecutive days, it was classified as a short‐term 
sickness absence episode. This is in line with the UK government reg‐
ulations, which requires employees to obtain a Statement of Fitness 
for Work from a general practitioner or hospital doctor if they are ab‐
sent for 7 consecutive days or longer (UK Government, 2017) and with 
previous research that has adopted this threshold (Ferrie et al., 2005).
2.3 | Shift work measures
We derived the following measures from the data set: shift length, type 
of shift (i.e., early, late, night, long day), and sickness absence episodes. 
Shift length was calculated as the difference between shift end and 
start time. Consequently, shift length was inclusive of breaks. Shifts 
were classified as “day” and “night” shifts based on the end time of the 
shift. If a shift finished before 8 a.m., it was classified as a night shift. 
For the purposes of descriptive and multivariable regression analysis 
we grouped shift length into three categories: 8 hr or less (≤8 hr), more 
than 8—less than 12 hr (>8–<12 hr), 12 hr or more (≥12 hr). In order to 
examine the effect of shift characteristics on sickness absence, a calcu‐
lation of shift characteristics worked in the past 7 days was performed.
We calculated:
• The proportion of shifts worked in the past 7 days that were long 
(≥12 hr)
• The proportion of shifts worked in the past 7 days that were night 
shifts
• The proportion of days in the past 7 days that were worked
     |  21
DALL’ORA et AL.
• Total number of hours worked in the past 7 days
Because the analysis was performed at the shift level, as opposed 
to the nurse level, no information was available on rotation status. 
However, by controlling for the proportion of night shifts worked in the 
past 7 days, shift rotation could be taken into account at least partially 
(i.e., those working 100% of their shifts as night shifts were likely to be 
those working on permanent night shifts schedules).
2.4 | Statistical analysis
We performed descriptive analyses of sickness absence, including 
short‐term and long‐term absence episodes. We then examined 
sickness absence by nurses’ shift characteristics. The association be‐
tween shift work characteristics and sickness absence was explored 
with generalized linear mixed models.
In order to assess the within‐ward and the within‐staff member 
variation for sickness, we computed intraclass correlation coeffi‐
cients (ICC) from unconditional random intercept models. The ICC 
revealed that most of the variation in sickness episodes occurred 
at the individual nurse level (ICC = 0.32), with almost no variation 
occurring at the ward level (ICC = 0.004). This low ICC did not justify 
the inclusion of ward as a random effect in the models (Lee, 2000).
All analyses were performed at the shift level. To account for 
the fact that shifts were nested in staff members (i.e., to account for 
individual variation), nursing staff ID was included as random effects 
in the model. We also included staff role (registered nurse vs health 
care assistant) as levels of sickness are known to vary between staff 
groups (NHS Digital, 2017). To exclude multicollinearity we tested 
each model for the variance inflation factor (VIF); all VIF scores were 
<10, indicating low multicollinearity (Dormann et al., 2013).
We first explored the likelihood of a shift being missed based 
on its scheduled length. Secondly, we explored the likelihood of a 
sickness episode based on the proportion of long shifts worked over 
the past 7 days. We added the proportion of night shifts and the 
proportion of worked shifts over the past 7 days and staff role as 
control variables. We performed subgroup analyses of short‐term 
and long‐term sickness absence. All data preparation and analyses 
were undertaken using R (version 3.4.0) (R Studio Team., 2016), with 
mixed‐effects modelling using the lme4 package (version 1.1–13) 
(Bates, , Mächler, , Bolker, & Walker, 2015).
3 | RESULTS
Our sample consisted of 601,282 shifts. The shifts were worked by 
1944 staff members; of these, 1,244 were RNs and 700 were HCAs 
(including 88 staff members that worked shifts as both HCA and 
RN). There were 38,051 shifts lost due to sickness absence (6.3%) 
corresponding to 8,090 separate sickness episodes.
Overall, 1689 staff (86%) experienced at least one sickness epi‐
sode during the 3‐year study period. The sickness episodes ranged 
from 1 day to 496 days in length; the most common length of sick‐
ness episodes was 2 days (n = 1,221, 15.1%). 2,532 (31.3%) sickness 
episodes lasted 7 or more days and were classified as long term sick‐
ness episodes, while the 5,555 sickness episodes lasting less than 
7 days were classified as short term sickness episodes.
Forty‐eight percent of shifts worked lasted 8 hr or less 
(n = 270,709), and 38% of shifts were 12 hr or more (n = 216,877). 
The majority of day shifts lasted 8 hr or less (n = 270,390, 67.6%) and 
most of the night shifts lasted 12 hr or more (n = 110,022, 67.3%). The 
length of shift differed by staff group; RNs worked a higher number of 
long shifts than HCAs (40.7% vs. 33.7%). Distributions of shift work 
characteristics by shift length categories can be found in Table 1.
If a shift was scheduled to be 12 hr or more in length, it was 
more likely to be missed due to sickness absence (OR = 1.24; 95% CI: 
1.16–1.31), compared with a shift of 8 hr or less. Odds of both short‐
term (OR = 1.18, 1.10–1.26) and‐long term (OR = 1.37, 1.23–1.53) 
sickness episodes were increased significantly when a shift was 
scheduled to last 12 hr or more. While shifts of between 8 and 12 hr 
were not associated with a significant increase in the overall odds of 
sickness, they were associated with an increase in long term sickness 
absence (OR 1.27; 95% CI: 1.11–1.46) (Table 2).
The percentage of sickness episodes was lower when no long 
shifts were worked in the past 7 days (1.4%), compared with 
working more than three quarters of shifts as long shifts (1.7%). 
Working more than three quarters of shifts in the past 7 days 
as night shifts showed the highest percentage of sickness ep‐
isodes (1.6%). The lowest proportion of days reflected a higher 
percentage of sickness episodes, and the highest proportions of 
days worked showed the lowest percentage of sickness episodes 
(Table 3).
Working shifts of 12 hr or more in the past 7 days was associated 
with an increase in sickness absence, after adjusting for other shift

variables. If more than 75% of shifts worked in the past 7 days were 
12 hr or more in length, the odds of experiencing a sickness episode 
were increased by 27%, compared with working no 12 hr or more 
shifts (OR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.18–1.37). Sickness absence was also sig‐
nificantly associated with the proportion of night shifts, days worked 
and grade of staff (Table 4).
There was a high correlation between the proportion of days 
worked in the past 7 days and the number of total hours worked 
(correlation coefficient = 0.85). Because there was a high correlation 
between these variables, we dropped the total number of hours and 
controlled for proportion of worked shift only. A sensitivity analysis 
suggested this had no material effect on estimates of coefficients for 
other parameters.
Subgroup analyses of long‐term and short‐term sickness absence 
revealed similar effects to those observed in the general sample. The 
odds of experiencing a short‐term sickness absence episode were 
higher for all staff working >25% of their shifts as 12 hr or more, with 
higher odds for those working >75% of their shifts as 12 hr or more 
(AOR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.18–1.44). For long‐term sickness absence, 
the only significant association was found for staff working >75% of 
their past shifts as ≥12 hr or more, compared with those working no 
12 hr or more shifts at all (AOR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.08–1.39), although 
all other proportions of long shifts were associated with non‐signif‐
icant increases (Table 5).
Since night shifts in our sample were longer in length (67.3% of 
night shifts lasted 12 hr or more), we ran the models with interaction 
terms between long shifts and night shifts but the relationship was 
not significant, suggesting that the effect of shifts of 12 hr or more 
remains constant, regardless of whether shifts are worked in the day 
or night. It has been suggested that working long shifts is associ‐
ated with a compressed working week, namely working longer but 
fewer days (Bambra, Whitehead, Sowden, Akers, & Petticrew, 2008);

therefore, we explored the interaction between long shifts and 
worked days, but the relationship was not significant. The Pearson 
correlation coefficient between long shifts and worked days was.20, 
indicating a weak correlation.
4 | DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to use longitudinal data and 
objective shift and outcome measures to explore the association 
between long shifts and sickness absence in registered nurses and 
health care assistants on hospital wards. We found that staff sched‐
uled to work a shift of 12 hr or more were 24% more likely to miss 
the shift due to sickness absence, compared with staff who were 
scheduled to work shifts of 8 hr or less.
While occasional shifts of 12 hr or more (<25%) in the past 
7 days were not significantly associated with more sickness ab‐
sence, when staff worked a higher proportion of shifts of 12 hr 
or more, sickness rates increased, with the highest odds for those 
working more than three quarters of their shifts as 12 hr or more 
shifts. Higher proportions of long shifts were associated with both 
long and short‐term sickness absence, although for long‐term sick‐
ness the only significant association was observed when staff had 
worked more than three quarters of their past shifts as long shifts.
These findings are consistent with previous work showing 
that working long shifts are associated with a higher likelihood of

reporting adverse staff outcomes, including burnout and job dis‐
satisfaction (Ball et al., 2017; Dall’Ora et al., 2015; Stimpfel et al., 
2012). These factors may in turn lead to sickness absence (Schaufeli, 
Bakker, & Van Rhenen, 2009). Our study shows that shifts of 12 hr 
or more are associated with both short‐term and long‐term sickness 
absence. Long‐term sickness is likely to reflect a health impairment 
process (Bakker, Demerouti, de Boer, & Schaufeli, 2003) and the 
longer‐term health consequences of working long shifts need to 
be further explored. Long shifts have been associated with higher 
levels of fatigue (Barker & Nussbaum, 2011; Chen, Davis, Daraiseh, 
Pan, & Davis, 2014). Fatigue is a well‐established predictor of sick‐
ness absence, suggesting that it may play a mediating role between 
long shifts and sickness absence (Janssen, Kant, Swaen, Janssen, & 
Schröer, 2003; Sagherian et al., 2017).
A previous study found that when nurses were working 8 hr 
shifts, they were more likely to report missed shifts than those 
working 12 hr shifts (Stone et al., 2006). However, if nurses 
worked 12 hr shifts as part of a compressed week, they worked 
fewer shifts overall, and so there were fewer shifts to be missed. 
Our study found that even when adjusting for days worked, the 
negative effect of higher proportions of long shifts remained sig‐
nificant, indicating that having a higher number of days off might 
not mitigate the negative effects of long shifts. These findings 
mirror evidence that the choice of the compressed work week for 
shift workers may be in conflict with the recommended criteria of 
a safe shift system, and health may be compromised (Kecklund, 
Eriksen, & Akerstedt, 2008).
In England, the USA and several European Union countries, shifts 
of 12 hr or more are becoming the norm and appear to be popular with 
some nurses, who are often reported preferring long shifts because 
of the greater number of days off work, compared with nurses work‐
ing 8 hr or less shift patterns (Ball, Dall’Ora, & Griffiths, 2015). Long 
shifts have been introduced as a strategy to reduce staffing costs by 
reducing the overlaps between shifts (NHS Evidence, 2010), with 
some NHS Trusts currently implementing mandatory 12.5 hr shifts 
for nursing staff hospital‐wide (Merrifield, 2017a). However, if long 
shifts are associated with higher rates of sickness, any benefits could 
be undermined. Increased sickness absence may lead to the increased 
use of agency staff to fill the vacant shift; this represents a costly op‐
tion that the NHS is increasingly trying to avoid (NHS Improvement, 
). Furthermore, agency nurses called to fill a vacant shift may be less 
productive and less effective (Bae, Mark, & Fried, 2010).
5 | LIMITATIONS
This study had some limitations. Firstly, this was a single site study, 
and these findings may not generalize to other hospitals. However, 
a previous study has noted that there tends to be more variation 
in shift patterns within hospitals than there is between hospitals in 
England (Griffiths et al., 2014). Furthermore, we were not able to 
account for staff characteristics including age and personal commit‐
ments external to work, both of which may influence responses to 
shift work. However, the inability to control for staff characteris‐
tics, including age and chronic illness, could lead to bias if such staff 
characteristics were systematically associated with staff electing to 
work specific shift patterns. Unless age and chronic illness were as‐
sociated with an increased preference for longer rather than shorter 
shifts, which seems unlikely from the limited available anecdotal evi‐
dence (Ball et al., 2015), the resulting bias would lead to underesti‐
mating the adverse effects of longer shifts. Furthermore, since staff 
ID was included as a random effect in our models (i.e., shifts were 
nested in individual staff members), individual characteristics were 
at least partially controlled for.
The ability to rest within and between shifts is an important fac‐
tor in relation to shift work (Tucker, Smith, Macdonald, & Folkard, 
1999; Wendsche, Ghadiri, Bengsch, & Wegge, 2017). We could not 
track shifts worked for other employers and whether staff were able 
to take scheduled breaks within shifts. If these factors are related to 
shift length they may partially explain the associations we observed, 
although they do not detract from the significance of the findings. 
Lastly, we were unable to determine the cause of sickness which 
could illuminate the mechanism through which long shifts might 
generate increased sickness. However, the association of long shifts 
with long‐term sickness and absence does indicate that long shifts 
are associated with potentially significant health problems. Future 
research should include cost‐effectiveness analyses on the effects 
of higher proportion of ≥12 hr shifts and further shift variables that 
are likely to have an impact on sickness absence.
6 | CONCLUSIONS
When nurses and health care assistants work high proportions of 
shifts of 12 hr or more, sickness absence is increased. As well as in‐
dicating worse health for employees, such increases may undermine 
a key motivation for introducing the 12 hr shift pattern—organisa‐
tional efficiency. Further moves toward routine implementation of 
long shifts should be reconsidered and neither organisational ben‐
efits nor benefits for staff should be assumed.
7 | IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING 
MANAGEMENT
Nurse managers are often required to organise, approve and review 
nursing staff members’ schedules. The main goal for nurse manag‐
ers is to ensure that the nursing workforce is configured so that safe 
quality of patient care can be delivered. As this research has found, 
how aspects of shift work are organised has implications for nurses’ 
sickness absence. The findings of this study indicate that working high 
proportions of shifts of 12 hr or more is likely to increase sickness 
absence in registered nurses and health care assistants. This finding, 
despite being far from the description of an “ideal” shift system in 
nursing, may offer further knowledge to nurse managers aiming to 
maintain and improve their employees’ job attendance and well‐being.

DALL’ORA et AL.
If staff were able to take breaks during their shifts, if the work‐
load during shifts were not exceedingly high and if there were 
enough staff on the wards to complete care activities, the effect 
of 12 hr shifts may be different. However, health care systems are 
struggling with an increasing nursing shortage (Attree et al., 2011), 
high rates of vacancies filled with temporary and agency staff (NHS 
Improvement, 2016) and anecdotal reports of lack of breaks during 
the shifts due to understaffing (Merrifield, 2017b). In this current 
context, these findings suggest that, while occasional 12 hr shift 
work may not have adverse consequences, working higher propor‐
tions may lead to higher sickness absence. Therefore, nurse man‐
agers should question the routine implementation of long shift 
patterns, especially if this is based on assumed cost savings.
