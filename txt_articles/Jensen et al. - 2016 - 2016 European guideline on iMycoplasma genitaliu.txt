Abstract
Mycoplasma genitalium infection contributes to 10–35% of non-chlamydial non-gonococcal urethritis in men. In women,
M. genitalium is associated with cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Transmission of M. genitalium occurs
through direct mucosal contact. Asymptomatic infections are frequent. In women, symptoms include vaginal discharge,
dysuria or symptoms of PID – abdominal pain and dyspareunia. In men, urethritis, dysuria and discharge predominates.
Besides symptoms, indication for laboratory test is a high-risk sexual behaviour. Diagnosis is achievable only through
nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). If available, NAAT diagnosis should be followed with an assay for macrolide
resistance. Therapy for M. genitalium is indicated if M. genitalium is detected or on an epidemiological basis. Doxycy-
cline has a low cure rate of 30–40%, but does not increase resistance. Azithromycin has a cure rate of 85–95% in macro-
lide susceptible infections. An extended course appears to have a higher cure rate. An increasing prevalence of
macrolide resistance, most likely due to widespread use of azithromycin 1 g single dose without test of cure, is drasti-
cally decreasing the cure rate. Moxifloxacin can be used as second-line therapy, but resistance is increasing. Uncompli-
cated M. genitalium infection should be treated with azithromycin 500 mg on day one, then 250 mg on days 2–5 (oral),
or josamycin 500 mg three times daily for 10 days (oral). Second line treatment and treatment for uncomplicated macro-
lide resistant M. genitalium infection is moxifloxacin 400 mg od for 7–10 days (oral). For third line treatment of persistent
M. genitalium infection after azithromycin and moxifloxacin doxycycline 100 mg two times daily for 14 days can be tried
and may cure 30%. Pristinamycin 1 g four times daily for 10 days (oral) has a cure rate of app. 90%. Complicated M.
genitalium infection (PID, epididymitis) is treated with moxifloxacin 400 mg od for 14 days.

Introduction
Mycoplasmas are the smallest free-living microorganisms.1 In
the urogenital tract, the relevant species are M. genitalium, Urea-
plasma urealyticum, U. parvum and M. hominis. M. hominis and
the ureaplasmas will not be dealt with in the present guideline.
Mycoplasma genitalium was first isolated in 1980.2 M. genital-
ium infection is unequivocally associated with male NGU3 and
even stronger associated with non-chlamydial non-gonococcal
urethritis (NCNGU). The prevalence of M. genitalium in men
with NCNGU ranges from 10% to 35%,3 thus contributing
significantly to the overall burden of disease. In comparison,
M. genitalium is detected in only 1% to 3.3% of men and
women in the general population.4–7 In women, several studies
have demonstrated the association between M. genitalium and
urethritis, cervicitis, endometritis, and pelvic inflammatory dis-
ease (PID).8–12 In a recent meta-analysis,13 significant associa-
tions were found between M. genitalium and cervicitis [pooled
odds ratio (OR) 1.66], and PID (pooled OR 2.14). M. genitalium
has been associated with preterm birth (pooled OR 1.89), and
spontaneous abortion (pooled OR 1.82), but the prevalence of

 M. genitalium in pregnant women in Europe is low,14,15 and
therefore, the relative importance of M. genitalium is probably
small. Studies have also shown an association with increased risk
of tubal factor infertility (pooled OR 2.43). In sub-analyses that
accounted for co-infections, Lis et al. found these associations to
be stronger.13
Persistence of M. genitalium after treatment is associated with
recurrent or persistent NGU, and up to 40% with this condition
are M. genitalium positive.16 In a recent meta-analysis, persistent
M. genitalium was associated with a pooled OR of 26 for persis-
tent urethritis.17 Thus, failure to eradicate M. genitalium leads to
persistent or recurrent disease in the vast majority of men with
persistent infection and diagnosis and optimal treatment is
extremely important. M. genitalium has been shown to facilitate
HIV transmission, in particular in studies from Sub-Saharan
Africa.18–20 If eradication fails due to inappropriate treatment,
this may have particularly important implications for increased
risk of HIV transmission.
Transmission
Transmission is primarily by direct genital-genital mucosal con-
tact. M. genitalium has been detected in anorectal samples by
culture and NAATs,21,22 and transmission from penile-anal sex-
ual contact has been established.23 Oral-genital contact is less
likely to contribute to any significant extent, as carriage of
M. genitalium in the oro-pharynx is low.24,25 Mother-to-child
transmission at birth has not been systematically studied, but
M. genitalium has been detected in the respiratory tract of new-
born children.26 The risk of contracting M. genitalium per sexual
encounter has not been determined, but because M. genitalium
is present in lower concentration in genital tract specimens than
C. trachomatis,27 it could be considered slightly less contagious
than chlamydia.
There are no estimates of the global burden of disease. In
sexually transmitted infection (STI) patients, the prevalence is
usually from 60% to 85% of that of C. trachomatis, but in the
general population, the ratio is generally significantly lower.4,6
Compared to C. trachomatis, the prevalence of M. genitalium
infected patients appear to peak approximately 5 years later for
both men and women and to remain higher in the older age
groups.28,29
Clinical features
Urogenital infections
Symptoms and signs in women
• Among sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic attendees,
40–75% are asymptomatic.11,12
• Symptoms are related to cervical and urethral infection and
include increased or altered vaginal discharge (<50%),
dysuria or urgency (30%) and, occasionally, inter-menstrual
or post coital bleeding or menorrhagia.11,12,30
• Cervicitis.
• Rectal and pharyngeal infections are usually asymptomatic.
• Lower abdominal pain (<20%) should raise suspicion of PID.
Complications in women13
• PID (endometritis, salpingitis).
• Tubal factor infertility (probably).
• Sexually acquired reactive arthritis (SARA) may occur.31
Symptoms and signs in men3
• 70% symptomatic in some STD clinic settings.32
• Urethritis (acute, persistent, and recurrent).
• Dysuria.
• Urethral discharge.
• Proctitis.
• Balanoposthitis has been associated with M. genitalium
infection in one study.33
Complications in men
• SARA may occur.31
• Epididymitis may occur.
Ocular infections
Ocular infections can result in conjunctivitis in adults34 but has
not been systematically studied. Neonatal conjunctivitis has not
been systematically studied.
Indications for laboratory testing [IV; C]
Symptoms
• Symptoms or signs of urethritis in men.
• Mucopurulent cervicitis.
• Cervical or vaginal discharge with risk factor for STI.
• Intermenstrual or post coital bleeding.
• Acute pelvic pain and/or PID.
• Acute epididymo-orchitis in a male aged <50 years.
Risk factors
• Any of the above symptoms in a regular sexual partner.
• Persons with high-risk sexual behaviour (age < 40 years
and >3 new sexual contacts in the last year). However, the
public health value of testing asymptomatic persons for
M. genitalium has not been established and decisions on
testing for M. genitalium should be informed by local
epidemiology when available.
• Sexual contact of persons with an STI or PID, in particular,
contacts of M. genitalium infected persons.
• Before termination of pregnancy or other procedures, that
breaches the cervical barrier.

 • Regular testing of men who have sex with men (MSM),
including anal sampling could be considered due to the
risk of increased HIV transmission.
Laboratory diagnostics [III; B]
Recommended diagnostic assays
NAATs identifying M. genitalium specific nucleic acid (DNA or
RNA) in clinical specimens are the only useful methods for diag-
nosis [III; B]. However, no commercially available NAAT assays
have been evaluated up to the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) approval standard, and the tests on the market which
have been CE marked to document conformity according to the
European Union (EU) legislation suffer from limited validation.
Consequently, it is extremely important that diagnostic labora-
tories carefully validate any commercial or in-house assays and
participate in external quality assurance assessment (EQA)
schemes such as the EQUALIS EQA scheme (http://www.equa-
lis.se/sv/vaar-verksamhet/extern-kvalitetssaekring/kvalitetssaek
ringsprogram/m-r/mycoplasma-genitalium-nukleinsyra-288/).
This EQA scheme has demonstrated substantial differences in
the sensitivity of participating laboratories.
With the widespread macrolide resistance in Europe, it is
strongly recommended that all positive tests be followed up with
an assay capable of detecting macrolide resistance mediating
mutations. A variety of methods are available for this pur-
pose.29,35–39 The main determinant for the selection of a resis-
tance
assay
are:
(i)
its
practical
implementation
in
the
laboratory, and (ii) its sensitivity (proportion of screening posi-
tive tests that can be resistance typed). The latter aspect varies
significantly between assays.
Determination of moxifloxacin resistance can also be carried
out using molecular methods although the correlate between
mutations in parC and in vitro moxifloxacin resistance is less
clear. At present, detection of moxifloxacin resistance mediating
mutations is probably not indicated on a routine basis in Eur-
ope, as the level of resistance is low (<5%)40 but it may be con-
sidered in the Asia-Pacific region where moxifloxacin resistance
is more common41–43 or in patients having acquired the infec-
tion in this region.
Specimens
It is difficult to make accurate recommendations regarding the
optimal sample type. First void urine from men and women pro-
vide a good diagnostic specimen which may be self-obtained.28
No data regarding the importance of holding urine for a certain
time are available, so procedures already in place for C. tra-
chomatis sampling can be followed. Vaginal swab (physician or
self-collected) also provide an appropriate sensitivity.44–46
No data are available regarding time after exposure to testing,
but in analogy to C. trachomatis, a 2-week period is considered
the minimal incubation time. Anal samples are useful in MSM
where as many as 70% of the infections will be missed if this site
is not sampled,47 but may also be relevant in women at risk.22
The association between an anal infection and symptoms is
uncertain, but the infection is likely to be transmitted if not
detected and treated.
In most settings, it will be appropriate to use the same sam-
pling procedure as for C. trachomatis testing. However, some
transport media such as the Aptima� (Hologic, Inc., MA, USA)
transport medium designed for C. trachomatis NAAT will lyse
M. genitalium, and may provide a poor sensitivity in an in-
house assay. This should be carefully evaluated for all in-house
assays and even for assays where a validated collection and
nucleic acid purification kit is not included [III B].
Management of patients
Information, explanation and advice for the patient
• Patients with M. genitalium infection should be advised to
abstain from unprotected sexual contact until they and their
partners have completed treatment, their symptoms have
resolved, and their test of cure (TOC) is negative [IV; C].
• Patients with M. genitalium infection (and their sexual con-
tacts) should be given information about the infection,
including details about transmission, prevention and com-
plications. It is recommended that both verbal and written
information be provided. Patient information leaflets are
available at the IUSTI website [IV; C].
• Patients with anal infection including MSM should be
informed about the risk of transmission from this site and
that the infection may be more difficult to eradicate. Conse-
quently, a TOC is important.
• Patients with M. genitalium infection should be screened
for other STIs, including C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae,
syphilis, HIV, and T. vaginalis where appropriate [IV; C].
Pregnancy
• M. genitalium infections during pregnancy may be associ-
ated with a modest increase in the risk of spontaneous abor-
tion
and
preterm
birth.13
In
macrolide
susceptible
infections, a 5-day-course of azithromycin is generally
acceptable. The choice of drugs for macrolide-resistant
infections is difficult, and risk associated with treatment
with the available antibiotics may outweigh the risk of
adverse pregnancy outcome. Thus, treatment, especially in
women with infection with a macrolide-resistant M. geni-
talium strain, may be considered postponed until after
delivery. Pristinamycin is considered safe in pregnancy and
may be considered in symptomatic women after consulta-
tion with an experienced microbiologist. Although little is
known about transmission during birth, the neonate should
be observed for signs of infection, primarily conjunctivitis
and respiratory tract infection [IV; C].

 Indications for therapy [IV; C]
• Detection of M. genitalium-specific nucleic acid in a clinical
specimen.
• Current partners of M. genitalium-positive patients should
be treated with the same antimicrobial as the index patient.
• If current partner does not attend for evaluation and test-
ing, epidemiological treatment should be offered with the
same regimen as given to the index patient.
• On epidemiological grounds for recent sexual contacts (pre-
vious 3 months). Ideally, specimens for M. genitalium
NAAT should be collected before treatment and treatment
should await the result of testing.
Therapy
Treatment
of
individuals
with
M. genitalium
urogenital
infection prevents sexual transmission and is likely to reduce the
risk
of
complications,
including
PID5
and
tubal
factor
infertility.13
Only few antimicrobial classes have activity against mycoplas-
mas including tetracyclines, macrolides and fluoroquinolones.
Doxycycline has a poor efficacy48–51 with microbiological cure
rates between 30% and 40%, whereas azithromycin given as a
1 g single dose has a cure rate of approximately 85% in macro-
lide-susceptible infections.48,49 A rapidly increasing prevalence
of macrolide resistance, however, is drastically decreasing the
overall cure rate. Most likely, this is caused by widespread use of
azithromycin as a 1 g single dose without TOC and subsequent
spread of resistant strains.
Azithromycin given as an extended regimen with 500 mg day
one followed by 250 mg days 2–5 (1.5 g total dose) is recom-
mended as the primary choice for treatment of M. genitalium
infections. Using extended azithromycin or other macrolide
antibiotics after failure with the 1 g single-dose regimen or in
the presence of pre-existing macrolide resistance mediating
mutations will not eradicate M. genitalium.
Macrolide resistance rates vary significantly geographically,
but where azithromycin 1 g single dose is used for treatment of
NGU, it is usually found in 30–45% of samples.29,40,43,52
Josamycin is widely used in Russia with 500 mg three times a
day for 10 days, but will not eradicate macrolide-resistant strains.
Moxifloxacin is the most commonly used second-line antimi-
crobial. It is bactericidal and has a cure rate approaching 100%
in infections with susceptible strains.53–56 However, resistance
has developed with treatment failures in up to 30%, primarily in
patients from the Asia-Pacific region. A significant proportion of
the M. genitalium strains had concurrent macrolide resistance
mediating mutations leaving very few available treatment
options.42,57–59
Pristinamycin is the only antimicrobial with documented
activity in patients failing both azithromycin and moxifloxacin.
Many of these cases additionally failed eradication with extended
dosage doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 14 days).59 In
Europe, it is registered only in France, but can be acquired after
special permit in most European countries. It should only be
used in the maximal recommended dose of 1 g four times a day
for 10 days (oral) as these patients are facing their last known
active antimicrobial therapy and dose reduction may lead to fail-
ure. Treatment failure has been reported also for pristinamycin,
but the influence of compliance in these cases is not fully under-
stood.
Recommended treatment for uncomplicated
M. genitalium infection in the absence of macrolide
resistance mediating mutations [IIb; B]
• Azithromycin 500 mg on day one, then 250 mg od days
2–5 (oral).
• Josamycin 500 mg three times daily for 10 days [IV; C].
Recommended treatment for uncomplicated macrolide-
resistant M. genitalium infection [IIb;B]
• Moxifloxacin 400 mg od for 7–10 days (oral). The optimal
duration of treatment is uncertain and a few observational
studies have found higher cure rate after longer treatment
in cervicitis.57
Recommended second-line treatment for uncomplicated
persistent M. genitalium infection [IIb; B]
• Moxifloxacin 400 mg od for 7–10 days (oral).
Recommended third-line treatment for persistent
M. genitalium infection after azithromycin and
moxifloxacin [III; B]
• Doxycycline 100 mg two times daily for 14 days can be
tried and will eradicate M. genitalium from approximately
30% of the patients, but the patient must be informed about
the poor eradication rate and accept to comply with advice
regarding sexual abstinence or condom use.
• Pristinamycin 1 g four times daily for 10 days (oral). The
patient should be informed about the need to comply
strictly with the dosage scheme.
Recommended treatment for complicated M. genitalium
infection (PID, epididymitis) [IV; C]
• Moxifloxacin 400 mg od for 14 days (oral).60
Partner notification
• Contact notification should be performed and documented
by appropriately trained professionals at the time of diagno-
sis to improve outcome [IV; C].
• Current partner should always be tested and treated with
the same antimicrobial as the index patient [IV; C].
• If current partner does not attend for evaluation and test-
ing, epidemiological treatment should be offered with the
same regimen as given to the index patient [IV; C].

M. genitalium guideline
1653
 • Recent sexual contacts (previous 3 months) should be con-
tacted and offered testing for M. genitalium infection and
testing for other STIs [IV; C].
Follow-up and TOC
• A TOC should be routinely performed in all patients due to
the high prevalence of macrolide resistance either present
pretreatment or developing during treatment with azithro-
mycin and in the absence of routine testing for fluoro-
quinolone resistance [III; B]. This recommendation differs
from the BASHH and CDC guidelines61,62 where TOC for
asymptomatic cases is not recommended. However, many
patients enter a stage of few or no symptoms after treat-
ment, but with persistent carriage and subsequent risk for
spread of resistance in the community. TOC samples should
be collected no earlier than 3 weeks after start of treatment
[III, B]. In patients responding to treatment, M. genitalium
will be undetectable within 1 week in most patients, but
tests may become temporarily false negative in patients fail-
ing treatment.63

Search strategy
A Medline search was conducted in May 2015 using PubMed.
The search heading was kept broad (Mycoplasma genitalium) to
include epidemiology, diagnosis, antimicrobial resistance, drug
therapy, clinical trials and prevention and control. Only publica-
tions and abstracts in the English language were considered. The
Cochrane library was searched for all entries related to myco-
plasma. Sexually transmitted diseases guidelines produced by the
US Centers for Disease Control (www.cdc.gov/std/) and the Bri-
tish Association for Sexual Health and HIV (www.bashh.org)
were also reviewed.
