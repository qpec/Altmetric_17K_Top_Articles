We sought to determine whether high-dose folinic acid improves verbal communication in children with non-syndromic autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) and language impairment in a double-blind placebo control setting. Forty-eight children (mean age 7
years 4 months; 82% male) with ASD and language impairment were randomized to receive 12 weeks of high-dose folinic acid
(2 mg kg − 1 per day, maximum 50 mg per day; n = 23) or placebo (n = 25). Children were subtyped by glutathione and folate
receptor-α autoantibody (FRAA) status. Improvement in verbal communication, as measured by a ability-appropriate standardized
instrument, was significantly greater in participants receiving folinic acid as compared with those receiving placebo, resulting in an
effect of 5.7 (1.0,10.4) standardized points with a medium-to-large effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.70). FRAA status was predictive of
response to treatment. For FRAA-positive participants, improvement in verbal communication was significantly greater in those
receiving folinic acid as compared with those receiving placebo, resulting in an effect of 7.3 (1.4,13.2) standardized points with a
large effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.91), indicating that folinic acid treatment may be more efficacious in children with ASD who are FRAA
positive. Improvements in subscales of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, the Autism Symptom
Questionnaire and the Behavioral Assessment System for Children were significantly greater in the folinic acid group as compared
with the placebo group. There was no significant difference in adverse effects between treatment groups. Thus, in this small trial of
children with non-syndromic ASD and language impairment, treatment with high-dose folinic acid for 12 weeks resulted in
improvement in verbal communication as compared with placebo, particularly in those participants who were positive for FRAAs.

INTRODUCTION
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a behaviorally defined disorder
whose etiology remains poorly understood. Recent estimates
suggest that up to 2% of children in the United States are affected
by an ASD.1 Recent research has uncovered associated physiolo-
gical abnormalities,2,3 but high-quality clinical trials investigating
biological
targeted
treatments
remain
limited.4,5
Thus,
the
development and investigation of treatments that target under-
lying pathophysiological abnormalities and core and associated
symptoms is urgently needed.4
Several abnormalities in the metabolism of folate, an essential
water-soluble B vitamin, have been linked to ASD.6 ASD is
associated with polymorphisms in folate-related pathway genes
and disruptions in folate-related metabolism may be related to
glutathione abnormalities associated with ASD (Supplementary
Figure S1).7 Supplementation with folate during the prenatal and
conception periods has been shown to lower the risk of ASD in
offspring.8–10
Folate is primarily transported across the choroid plexus
epithelium attached to the folate receptor α (FRα) using energy-
dependent endocytosis (Supplementary Figure S1).11 Cerebral
folate deficiency, a disorder in which folate concentrations are
below normal in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) but not in the blood,
was first described in six children with neurodevelopmental
regression and neurological abnormalities. Treatment with folinic
acid, a reduced form of folate, normalized CSF folate concentra-
tions and significantly improved neurological symptoms.12 Further
case descriptions demonstrated that many of the children with
cerebral folate deficiency had ASD and that treatment with folinic
acid improved the ASD symptoms as well as other neurological
symptoms.5,11,13–15 Interestingly, individuals with Rett syndrome, a
disorder closely related to ASD, have also been found to have
cerebral folate deficiency.16–18
FRα dysfunction was first linked to FRα autoantibodies (FRAAs)11
with later reports also linking FRα dysfunction to mitochondrial
disease.19–22 An intriguing finding is that genetic mutations in the
FOLR1 gene, which is the gene for the FRα, rarely accounts for
cerebral folate deficiency.23 Two types of FRAAs, blocking and
binding, impair folate transport24 and serum titers of the blocking
FRAA have been correlated with CSF folate concentrations in
independent studies.24,25 The blocking FRAA directly interferes
with the binding of folate to the FRα while the binding FRAA
binds to the FRα and triggers an antibody-mediated immune
reaction.26,27
The presence of central folate disturbances in ASD is supported
by several studies.

 Of 93 children with ASD, 60 and 44% were positive for blocking
and binding FRAAs, respectively.24 Another study which examined
only blocking FRAAs in children with ASD confirmed this high
prevalence.28 These rates are clearly higher than the 4–15%
prevalence reported in healthy adults24 and the 3% prevalence
reported in developmentally delayed non-autistic children.28
Interestingly, a recent animal study suggested that FRAAs can
disrupt folate metabolism during gestation resulting in ASD-like
behaviors in the offspring.29 More recently, up to 23% of children
with ASD who underwent lumbar puncture were reported to have
abnormally low CSF folate concentrations.30
The reduced folate carrier is a secondary mechanism which
transports reduced folates, such as folinic acid, across the blood–
brain barrier, although high serum concentrations are required
since the reduced folate carrier has a lower affinity for folate (i.e.,
micromolar concentrations) than the FRα (i.e., nanomolar con-
centrations; Supplementary Figure S1A).11,24 Case reports and
series note that high-dose
folinic acid markedly improves
symptoms
in
children
with
ASD
and
low
CSF
folate
concentrations.11,24 In a controlled open-label study, we found
that children with ASD who were positive for at least one FRAA
experienced significant improvements in verbal communication,
receptive and expressive language, attention, and stereotypical
behavior with high-dose (2 mg kg − 1 per day in two divided doses;
maximum 50 mg per day) folinic acid treatment with very few
adverse effects reported.24
To determine whether high-dose folinic acid can improve core
and associated ASD symptoms, we conducted a single-site
randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. It was
hypothesized that high-dose folinic acid would alleviate ASD
symptoms, particularly in children with folate-related metabolic
abnormalities. In addition, we sought to determine if biomarkers
of disruptions in folate metabolism, such as the FRAA, could
predict which children would respond to folinic acid treatment, so
that invasive diagnostic procedures such as a lumbar puncture
might be avoided.

 as language impaired. Otherwise, the age-appropriate version of the
Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF) confirmed language
impairment. Language impairment was defined as a core standardized
score o85 if the preschool version was used or failure on the CELF
screener if other versions were used.
Those confirmed to have language impairment were randomized to the
folinic acid or placebo group and a fasting blood sample was obtained.
Randomization was performed using a random number generator with a
block size of four. The research pharmacists had exclusive access to the
randomization allocation. After breakfast, the participants returned for
language, developmental and behavioral assessments. Following these
assessments the family was given the 12 weeks of the intervention and
was instructed on its administration. Language, developmental and
behavioral assessments were repeated after 12 weeks of treatment.
Parent and teacher questionnaires were requested at baseline and 6 and
12 weeks after starting treatment. Parents were asked to deliver baseline
questionnaires to teachers or therapists. After the first visit, questionnaires
were mailed to the parents and teachers at least 1 week prior to the target
date of completion. Parents were asked to bring the completed teacher
and parent 12-week questionnaires to the final assessment. Other
questionnaires were returned in a preaddressed postage-paid envelope.
Intervention
The target dose of the intervention (INN: DL folinic acid calcium salt; USAN:
leucovorin calcium) was 2 mg kg − 1 per day (maximum 50 mg per day) in
two equally divided doses with half of the target dose given during the
first 2 weeks. Dye-free, milk-product-free, vegetarian capsules were
provided in three strengths (5, 10 and 25 mg) by Lee Silsby Compounding
Pharmacy (Cleveland Heights, OH, USA). Certificate of analysis was
provided for each capsule strength by an independent analytical service
(Eagle Analytical Services, Houston, TX, USA) for each batch of capsules
produced. In all cases, potency was at least 99%.
To verify that folinic acid and placebo capsules were indistinguishable
by sight and feel, 10 scientists, 10 medical staff and 10 parents of children
with ASD not involved in the study were asked to sort eight small plastic
numbered bags, each containing two same strength capsules, into two
groups (placebo and folinic acid) of four based upon capsule similarity. No
one was able to accurately sort these bags (Binomial P = 0.04). Parents were
instructed that capsules could be opened and the powder added to food
or drink if swallowing the medication was difficult for the child. Both the
placebo and folinic acid powder were odorless and tasteless. No parent or
child commented on the odor or taste of the medication, providing further
evidence of the tasteless and odorless nature of the treatment.
Parents were asked about missed doses and returned pill containers
were examined for adherence which was calculated by the research
pharmacy.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Participants were recruited from our research registry (48%), autism clinic
(23%), community advertisement and social media (13%), word-of-mouth
(10%) and physician referrals (2%). The ASD diagnosis was defined by one
of the following: (i) a gold-standard diagnostic instrument such as the
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and/or Autism Diagnostic Inter-
view-Revised; (ii) the state of Arkansas diagnostic standard, defined as
agreement of a physician, psychologist and speech therapist; and/or (iii)
Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM) diagnosis by a physician along with
standardized validated questionnaires and diagnosis confirmation by the
Principal Investigator. Reconfirmation of the diagnosis using the lifetime
version of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised by an independent
research reliable rater was requested from all participants.
Inclusion criteria included: (i) age 3–14 years of age; (ii) documentation
of language impairment; (iii) unchanged complementary, traditional,
behavioral and education therapy 8 weeks prior to enrollment; and (iv)
intention to maintain ongoing therapies constant throughout the trial.

Outcome measures
All primary and secondary outcomes were obtained at baseline and study
end. Questionnaires were also requested 6 weeks after starting the
intervention. Aside from the research pharmacists, study staff, participants,
parents and teachers were blind to treatment allocation.
Primary outcome.
Verbal communication was the primary outcome for
several reasons. First, verbal communication improved in preliminary
folinic acid treatment studies.24 Second, verbal communication in children
with ASD is closely linked to parental quality of life.31 Third, the
development of language and communication skills is associated with
favorable outcomes.32–34
It should be acknowledged that communication impairment was
considered a core feature of ASD up until the DSM-V, which has now
combined communication and social symptoms into a social–communica-
tion symptom cluster. In the DSM-V language impairment is recognized as
a significant comorbidity interrelated to the ASD diagnosis.
Verbal communication was assessed by an ability-appropriate instru-
ment. Instruments used were the CELF-preschool-2, CELF-4 and the
Preschool Language Scale-5 (PLS-5). The CELF is a standardized, well-
validated instrument that assesses skills that are abnormal in ASD35 and
has been used in studies focusing on verbal communication in ASD.36,37
The PLS-5 is a standardized, well-validated instrument that measures
subtle
changes in
verbal
communication,
particularly
in
preverbal
children.38 The standardized summary score of each instrument (mean
100, standard deviation 15) was the primary outcome measure and ranges
from 50 to 150 for the PLS-5 and 45 to 155 for the CELF.
The ability-appropriate instrument was selected using a structured
algorithm. The goal was to select an instrument with an adequate dynamic
range for assessing improvement in verbal communication. The assess-
ment started with the most age-appropriate instrument.
If the child obtained a score at the floor, the next lower ability
instrument was then used. This process was repeated until a score above
the floor could be obtained. The score from the final instrument was the
primary outcome measure at baseline and at trial end. If the child’s age
exceeded the maximum age of the instrument’s standardization, the
maximum standardized age was used. At trial end, all instruments used
during the baseline assessment were repeated in the same order to
simulate the same baseline assessment experience and to minimize a
potential confounder of cognitive fatigue.
Studies have shown that early behavioral therapy improves verbal
communication by one-standard deviation over 36 weeks.39,40 Thus, a
clinically meaningful change was defined as a 5-point increase in verbal
communication in this 12-week study since the primary outcome has a 15
point standard deviation. Examining the standard error of participants in
the current study suggests that an minimal clinically important difference
is 2 points.
Secondary outcomes.
Secondary outcome measures included the Ohio
Autism Clinical Impression Scale (OACIS), Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale
2nd Edition (VABS) Survey Interview Form and several questionnaires.
Parents and teachers were asked to complete the Aberrant Behavior
Checklist
(ABC),
Social
Responsiveness
Scale
(SRS)
and
Behavioral
Assessment System for Children 2nd Edition (BASC). Only parents were
asked to complete the Autism Impact Measure (AIM) and Autism
Symptoms Questionnaire (ASQ).
The OACIS is an observer-rated scale sensitive to clinically meaningful
changes in ASD symptoms.41 It was first developed as the Ohio State
University Autism Rating Scale42 and has been shown to have good inter-
rater and cross-cultural reliability43 and has been successfully used in
several ASD clinical trials.44–47 Severity of each symptom was rated by the
first author at baseline and at the final assessment by observing the entire

 assessment of verbal communication. In validation studies a 0.5-point
change was considered clinically meaningful.43
The VABS is a reliable and valid measure of the ability to perform age-
appropriate everyday skills though a 20–30 min structured interview with a
caretaker.47 Standard scores from the communication, daily living, social
and motor skills, and adaptive behavioral composite were analyzed.
Standard scores have a mean of 100, standard deviation of 15 and range
20–160. Intervention studies in ASD have demonstrated a change of 6
points to be clinically meaningful.48
The ABC is a 58-item questionnaire47 that measures disruptive
behaviors, including Irritability (15 items, range 0–45); Social Withdrawal
(16 items, range 0–48); Stereotypy (7 items, range 0–21); Hyperactivity (16
items, range 0–48) and Inappropriate Speech (4 items, range 0–12). Each
item is rated 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating greater severity. Multiple
ASD clinical trials have used it and it has convergent and divergent
validity.49 Interventional ASD studies suggest a 12-point decrease in the
total score is clinically meaningful.45
The BASC ranges from 185 to 306 items and is validated in ASD.50 Each
item is rated 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating greater severity.
Standardized T-Scores (mean 50, standard deviation 10) range 20–120 for
externalizing, internalizing and behavioral symptoms and 10–90 for
adaptive skills.
The SRS is a 65-item questionnaire that measures social skills across five
domains: Social Awareness (8 items, meaningful change 7.1), Social
Cognition (12 items, meaningful change 5.8), Social Communication
(22 items, meaningful change 4.2), Social Motivation (11 items, meaningful
change 5.7), Autistic Mannerisms (12 items, meaningful change 5.5) and
total (65 items). Each item is rated 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating
greater severity. Standardized T-scores (mean 50, standard deviation 10)
range 30–90.
The AIM, a 45-item parent-reported measure of the frequency and
impact of core ASD symptoms during the past 2 weeks using two 5-point
scales of increasing severity ranging from 1 to 5.51 The Frequency and
Impact scores range 45–225.
The ASQ, a 34-item checklist (The Center for Autism and Related
Disorders) that assesses social interaction (12 items, range 0–4), stereo-
typed behavior (7 items, range 0–4), communication symptoms (15 items,
range 0–5) and total symptoms (34 items, range 0–13).52 Intervention ASD
studies suggest a 1.1 point change as clinically meaningful.52
Biomarkers.
Two folate-related biomarkers were investigated. FRAA titers,
both blocking and binding, were analyzed.24 Plasma free reduced-to-
oxidized glutathione redox ratio was determined.48 Folate-related vitamins
and minerals were measured. Serum total folate and vitamin B12 were
measured
using
MP
Diagnostics
SimulTRAC-SNB
Radioassay
Kit
(Cat# 06B264806). Plasma zinc, whole blood copper and red blood cell
magnesium were analyzed by Doctor’s Data.
Establishment and maintenance of assessment fidelity
Research staff was trained by a multispecialty team consisting of two
licensed psychologists and a speech therapist prior to performing
assessments. During the trial a research psychologist supervised research
staff and provided feedback and retraining if necessary.
Adverse effects monitoring
Adverse events were monitored every 3 weeks using a modification of the
Dosage Record Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale. Adverse events were
considered related to the treatment if they started or worsened following
the start of the trial. If adverse events were persistent or severe, the parents
were offered the option of halving the dose or discontinuing the
intervention. The dose could only be reduced once and was never
increased if reduced.
Statistical analysis
An intention-to-treat analysis was used.53 Analyses used SAS version 9.3. To
account for missing data multiple imputation was conducted.53,54 An
imputation of 20 was used55,56 and sensitivity analysis was used to check
for systematic bias.57
Mixed-effects regression models58 were used to estimate the effect and
effect size of the treatment. The models included the effect of time and a
random intercept to account for each individual’s symptom level. The
models tested the a priori hypothesis that the change in the outcome
measure was greater for the folinic acid group as compared with the
placebo group. This interaction was tested specifically using a two-tailed
t-test with a Po0.05. Since our previous study24 demonstrated a large
effect size, this study was powered with a large effect size (Cohen’s
d = 0.80), which provided a 77% power with 24 participants per group.
Analyses were conducted on subgroups defined by biomarkers of
abnormal folate metabolism. FRAAs were dichotomized as positive and
negative and the glutathione redox ratio was dichotomized to relatively
high (more normal; above the median of 8.30) and low (more abnormal;
below the median of 8.30). Mixed-model regressions, similar to the one
described above, were conducted on each subgroup separately since the
study was not powered to investigate interaction with these biomarkers
using the mixed model.
A responder analysis was conducted using backward elimination
(P ⩽ 0.05 to stay in model) logistic regression. Response was defined by a
five standardized point increase in verbal communication since this defines
a clinically meaningful change. Age, baseline language and baseline overall
development (as indexed by the VABS Behavioral Composite Standardized
Score) were entered as potential covariates. To investigate whether the
biomarkers of abnormal folate metabolism were related to participant
response, logistic regressions were conducted with an interaction between
treatment group and each biomarker.
Secondary outcome measures were analyzed using the mixed-model
regression. Because of the large number of secondary outcomes,
correction for multiple comparisons was conducted using the false
discovery rate.59

High-dose folinic acid treatment for autism
RE Frye et al
253
Molecular Psychiatry (2018), 247 – 256
 The total number of patients reporting each adverse event was
compared across treatment groups using a Fisher exact test. Adverse
events that were possibly, probably or definitely related to the treatments
were analyzed.
RESULTS
Participants
One hundred fifty-six participants were prescreened, with 59
found to potentially meet inclusion/exclusion criteria (Figure 1), of
which 11 failed screening, 10 because of no language impairment
and 1 because of congenital hearing impairment. Twenty-five
participants were randomized to receive placebo and 23 were
randomized to receive high-dose folinic acid (age range 3 years
4 months to 13 years 4 months).
Participant characteristics were similar across treatment groups
except for multivitamins (Table 1). Baseline outcome measures
were not significantly different across treatment groups except
for
verbal
communication
in
FRAA-negative
participants
(F(1,14) = 4.58, P = 0.05; Tables 2A and 2B). All participants
evaluated by an independent research reliable rater exceeded
the diagnostic threshold for ASD. The mean number of missed
doses per week was not significantly different across groups.
Adherence was 490% for those who returned the bottles
(20/25 placebo; 16/21 folinic acid).
Primary outcome
Improvement in verbal communication was significantly greater
for the participants on folinic acid as compared with participants
on placebo with a medium-to-large effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.70)
(Table 2A).
Separate analyses were conducted for each biomarker of folate
metabolism (Table 2A). In general, improvement in verbal
communication was significantly greater in participants on folinic
acid as compared with those on placebo for participants with
abnormal folate metabolism (i.e., FRAA positive, low glutathione
redox ratio). For participants with biomarkers indicating more
normal folate metabolism (i.e., FRAA negative, high glutathione
redox ratio) improvement in verbal communication was not
significantly different between groups.
A responder analysis was also performed. Overall, there were
significantly more responders in the folinic acid group as
compared
with
those
on
placebo
(χ2(1) = 8.92,
P = 0.003;
Table 2B). FRAAs predicted response to folinic acid (χ2(1) = 4.92,
P = 0.03). For both analyses, greater baseline Adaptive Behavior
Composite Score increased the likelihood of response (χ2(1) = 6.92,
P = 0.009 and χ2(1) = 7.74, P = 0.005, respectively) but all other
potential covariates were removed by backward elimination.
Glutathione redox status was not significantly associated with
treatment response.
Secondary outcomes
Table 3 outlines secondary outcomes, including the minimal
clinically important difference. The Daily Living Skills on the VABS
significantly improved in the folinic acid group as compared with
the placebo group.
Adherence on the parental questionnaires was not significantly
different across treatment groups. Irritability, lethargy, stereotyped
behavior, hyperactivity, inappropriate speech and total score on
the ABC significantly improved in the folinic acid group as
compared with the placebo group. Stereotypic behavior and total
score significantly improved for the folinic acid group as
compared with the placebo group on the ASQ. Internalizing
problems significantly improved for the folinic acid group as
compared with the placebo group on the BASC.
Teacher questionnaires were not analyzed since adherence was
below 35%.
Adverse events
There were no serious adverse events in the folinic acid group.
One child on placebo was unblinded and removed from the study
because of a potential serious adverse event. Three placebo
participants underwent dose reduction. There were no significant
group differences between adverse event frequencies (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
This study found an improvement in an important core ASD
symptom, verbal communication, in non-syndromic ASD children
receiving high-dose folinic acid vs placebo, particularly in those
participants who were positive for FRAAs. Improvement in a
number of secondary outcomes was observed as well, with no
significant adverse events. The effect of folinic acid is consistent
with the therapeutic effect of early behavioral interventions.39,40
Folinic acid may have positive effects on metabolism through
multiple pathways (Supplementary Figure S1). First, folinic acid
can normalize folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism.60 Sec-
ond, unlike folic acid, the common oxidized synthetic form of
folate, folinic acid can readily enter the folate cycle without being
reduced by dihydrofolate reductase.7 Third, folinic acid can cross
the blood–brain barrier using the reduced folate carrier when the
FRα is blocked by FRAAs or is non-functional due to mitochondrial
dysfunction or genetic mutations.24,27
This study suggests that FRAAs predict response to high-dose
folinic acid treatment. This is consistent with the notion that
children with ASD and FRAAs may represent a distinct subgroup.61
Other factors such as genetic polymorphisms in folate-related
genes
or
mitochondrial
dysfunction
may
be
important
in
determining treatment response but were not examined in this
study. When methylcobalamin was combined with folinic acid,
improvement in communication as well as glutathione redox
status was found.48 Indeed, future studies will be needed to define
factors that predict response to treatment, investigate optimal
dosing and help understand whether other compounds could
work synergistically with folinic acid.
This study had limitations. First, the small sample size may have
resulted in the imbalance in baseline language scores for one
subgroup and limited the sensitivity of the analyses to detect
some treatment effects. Second, the single-site design only
provides limited generalization of these results. Third, although
no adverse events were identified, safety of this treatment
requires further study since many folate studies utilize lower
doses and a healthy population. Fourth, further studies will be
needed to determine the optimal folinic acid dose. The oral
bioavailability of folate is strongly influenced by the enteric
microbiome62 but there is strong evidence that the enteric
microbiome is altered in children with ASD.63
Only two drugs have been approved by the United States Food
and Drug Administration for the
treatment of ASD, both
antipsychotic drugs indicated for associated, not core, ASD
symptoms. Within 12 weeks these medications can detrimentally
affect lipid, cholesterol and glucose metabolism and result in
marked body weight gain64 and can increase the risk of
developing type 2 diabetes.65 Thus, well-tolerated medications
that target pathophysiological processes and core symptoms
associated with ASD are sorely needed.
Folinic acid is among other recently described treatments that
target metabolic abnormalities and core symptoms associated
with ASD.45,47,48,66–70 This study also supports the notion that
measurement of FRAAs prior to a trial of folinic acid may be
helpful for predicting response. In our previous study we offered
folinic acid treatment to patients positive for FRAAs without
obtaining CSF folate concentration measurement.24 We continue
to believe this is a reasonable alternative to a diagnostic lumbar
puncture but should be accompanied by close follow-up with an

 experienced physician. Since ASD is likely a lifelong disorder the
long-term adverse effect of any treatment is of concern. As folinic
acid may become increasingly used to treat ASD in the future,
short-term and long-term adverse effects should be studied in
more detail to ensure safety.
CONCLUSIONS
In this small trial of children with non-syndromic ASD and
language impairment, treatment with high-dose folinic acid for
12 weeks resulted in improvement in measures of verbal
communication as compared with placebo. These findings should
be considered preliminary until treatment is assessed in larger
multicenter studies with longer duration.
