The burden of disease in Greece, health loss, risk factors, and 
health financing, 2000–16: an analysis of the Global Burden 
of Disease Study 2016
Global Burden of Disease 2016 Greece Collaborators* 
Summary
Background Following the economic crisis in Greece in 2010, the country’s ongoing austerity measures include a 
substantial contraction of health-care expenditure, with reports of subsequent negative health consequences. 
A comprehensive evaluation of mortality and morbidity is required to understand the current challenges of public 
health in Greece.
Methods We used the results of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 to 
describe the patterns of death and disability among those living in Greece from 2000 to 2010 (pre-austerity) and 
2010 to 2016 (post-austerity), and compared trends in health outcomes and health expenditure to those in Cyprus and 
western Europe. We estimated all-cause mortality from vital registration data, and we calculated cause-specific deaths 
and years of life lost. Age-standardised mortality rates were compared using the annualised rate of change (ARC). 
Mortality risk factors were assessed using a comparative risk assessment framework for 84 risk factors and clusters to 
calculative summary exposure values and population attributable fraction statistics. We assessed the association 
between trends in total, government, out-of-pocket, and prepaid public health expenditure and all-cause mortality 
with a segmented correlation analysis.
Findings All-age mortality in Greece increased from 944·5 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 923·1–964·5) deaths per 
100 000 in 2000 to 997·8 (975·4–1018) in 2010 and 1174·9 (1107·4–1243·2) in 2016, with a higher ARC after 2010 and 
the introduction of austerity (2·72% [1·65 to 3·74] for 2010–16) than before (0·55% [0·24 to 0·85] for 2000–10) or in 
western Europe during the same period (0·86% [0·54 to 1·17]). Age-standardised reduction in ARC approximately 
halved from 2000–10 (–1·61 [95% UI –1·91 to –1·30]) to 2010–16 (–0·87% [–2·03 to 0·20]), with post-2010 ARC 
similar to that in Cyprus (–0·86% [–1·4 to –0·36]) and lower than in western Europe (–1·14% [–1·48 to –0·81]). 
Mortality changes in Greece coincided with a rapid decrease in government health expenditure, but also with 
aggregate population ageing from 2010 to 2016 that was faster than observed in Cyprus. Causes of death that increased 
were largely those that are responsive to health care. Comparable temporal and age patterns were noted for non-fatal 
health outcomes, with a somewhat faster rise in years lived with disability since 2010 in Greece compared with Cyprus 
and western Europe. Risk factor exposures, especially high body-mass index, smoking, and alcohol use, explained 
much of the mortality increase in Greek adults aged 15–49 years, but only explained a minority of that in adults older 
than 70 years.
Interpretation The findings of increases in total deaths and accelerated population ageing call for specific focus from 
health policy makers to ensure the health-care system is equipped to meet the needs of the people in Greece.

Introduction
Greece entered an austerity programme in 2010 as part of 
a financial bailout imposed by the European Commission 
and the European Central Bank in coalition with the 
International Monetary Fund.1 Its recession has been 
compared with the USA’s great depression of 1929–39, 
with most of the budget allocated to debt payoff, and 
contraction of national gross domestic product (GDP).2 
Compounded by a shrinking economy, health expenditure 
in Greece also proportionally shrank from 9·8% of 
GDP in 2008 to 8·1% in 2014.2–4 Reduced health spending, 
required as part of the austerity programme, has been 
criticised for not containing specific provisions to 
safeguard the National Health System,4,5 a system 
instituted in the 1980s as part of the national programme 
of compulsory social insurance and through which most 
residents of Greece receive care. By contrast, health 
expenditure within the EU rose from 9·4% of GDP in 
2008 to 10% in 2014.6

needs.7–9 According to the Hellenic Centre for Disease 
Control and Prevention, tuberculosis rates have risen 
among native-born Greeks.8 HIV incidence nearly 
doubled from 2010 to 2012, reaching 10·4 per 
100 000 population and prompting reinstatement of 
syringe distribution programmes; subsequently, HIV 
incidence decreased from 2012 to 2016, back to 5·7 per 
100 000.10 Increasing rates of major depression and 
suicidality have been documented,4,11 along with 
stagnation in maternal, infant, and child mortality.3,12,13
Despite the temporal relationship with austerity 
measures, these reports were criticised for not being 
supported by national estimate data,14 or being only partly 
associated with the economic downturn.15 Furthermore, 
some published communications reported less dramatic 
health changes in Greece, including actual improvements 
in cardiovascular mortality.16,17 The discordance of 
estimates derived from different data sources, such as 
between the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) and 
the EU’s statistical office (EUROSTAT), has been further 
suggested as an obstacle to obtaining pragmatic estimates 
for temporal changes in health indicators in Greece.18
As a sovereign nation neighbouring Greece that 
shares the Greek ethnicity (with a smaller fraction 
of Turkish Cypriots, Armenians, and Maronites), 
language, and socioeconomic structure at large, Cyprus 
represents as close a direct comparator to Greece as 
exists in western Europe. Although in former years 
large proportions of the population adhered to a 
Mediterranean diet, dietary habits are changing rapidly, 
with increasing obesity, persistent smoking, and alcohol 
use despite public health efforts to reduce consumption. 
Similar to Greece, a steep rise in HIV was documented 
in Cyprus post-2010,19 but the prevalence and trends of 
other conditions in Cyprus have been much less 
explored. Cyprus also felt the profound impacts from 
the recession and entered a financial bailout programme 
in the 2012–13 period in the aftermath of the Greek 
financial crisis, although recovery was faster than in 
Greece.19
Documenting of the effect of diseases on population 
health is very demanding from the standpoint of 
both surveillance and analytical methods. The only 
comprehensive effort to quantify global population 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Following the global financial crisis, Greece entered into an 
austerity programme in 2010 that has substantially affected 
health expenditures. Reports from the Hellenic Statistical 
Authority, the European Centers for Disease Control, and 
published studies have documented untoward effects on public 
health following the onset of austerity measures. However, these 
studies have generally been limited in scope, including being 
limited to examining only a few causes of illness or mortality, 
examining only official statistics, and not continuing beyond the 
first few years of austerity. To better understand the current state 
of public health in Greece, its trajectory pre-2010 and post-2010, 
and the broader impacts of financial crisis and austerity on health 
requires comprehensive evaluation of multiple health-related 
domains, including all-cause and cause-specific mortality, 
non-fatal health loss, risk factors, health spending, and 
demographics. 
Added value of this study
This study expands on what is known about the effects of the 
austerity-driven reductions in national health spending on 
population health in Greece by utilising data from the most 
comprehensive effort to date to estimate summary measures of 
global population health—the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) initiative. Previous research has 
focused on the reporting of short-term mortality and morbidity 
trends that were observed within the first years of the 
implementation of the austerity programme that limits their 
sensitivity to detect adverse health outcomes with longer 
incubation times. In addition to assessing risk factors for the 
aforementioned health changes, this study investigates the 
temporal linkage between health financing and health loss until 
2015. We did a comprehensive analysis of annual changes in 
population health in Greece from 2000 to 2016 using regional 
comparators that allowed us to capture region-specific divergent 
temporal trends, and we assessed these trends in conjunction 
with population structure data and health financing measures. 
The combination of these data sources enabled us to identify 
evidence of a disproportionate decrement in the health of Greeks 
as compared with regional populations from 2000 to 2010 
(pre-austerity era) to those from 2010 to 2016 (post-austerity 
era), which was concordant with decreases in national health 
spending. Further comparison of crude and age-standardised 
mortality rates indicated accelerated population ageing in Greece 
compared with Cyprus, with major population shrinkage in the 
15–34 years that might be associated to indirect effects of the 
crisis, such as longstanding unemployment, reduced wages, and 
stringent taxation schedules.
Implications of all the available evidence
These findings point to multifaceted effects of the financial crisis 
in Greece: direct effects of reduced health spending on mortality 
and to a lesser extent morbidity age and temporal trends, and 
indirect effects related to a major shift in demographics with 
population ageing emerging as a public health concern. 
The increase in total deaths in children younger than 5 years and 
older adults with increase in causes sensitive to resource 
availability (eg, access to screening and urgent care) suggest that 
the health system requires substantial restructuring to cope with 
the effects that the financial crisis has had on resource 
availability, resource allocation, and population structure.

health is the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors Study (GBD).20 GBD is therefore the natural 
platform for comparison between different locations. 
In this report, we use the GBD 2016 results to explore 
temporal trends in health loss, risk factors, and health 
financing in Greece from 2000 to 2016, comparing with 
those of Cyprus and western Europe overall.
Methods
Overview and metrics
GBD 2016 quantified multiple measures of health loss 
for 333 causes and 84 risk factors for each of 195 countries 
and territories, 23 age groups, and both sexes from 
1990 to 2016.21 For the present analysis, we compared 
Greece, Cyprus (estimates refer to the Republic of Cyprus 
only), and the GBD region of western Europe (Andorra, 
Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, 
Germany, 
Greece, 
Iceland, 
Ireland, 
Israel, 
Italy, 
Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, 
and Spain). Our comparisons are primarily for both 
sexes combined and for wider-ranging age groups than 
those used in the analysis. 
We compared rates across locations to control for 
population size, age standardisation to control for age 
structure, and comparative rankings and disease rates 
from more granular age groups to examine specific 
causes and risk factors more closely. We compared trends 
using the annualised rate of change (ARC), computed as 
the final estimates, divided by initial estimates, then 
divided by number of years, using the natural log 
transformation of this figure. Detailed methods for the 
overall study and for each specific cause and risk are 
available in the GBD 2016 summary publications,21–25 
each of which is GATHER compliant. The next sections 
are brief descriptions of methods for deriving each of the 
GBD metrics included in the present analysis; these 
metrics include deaths, health expenditure, years lived 
with disability (YLDs), and summary exposure values 
(SEV) for risk factors. 
The GBD study’s protocol has been approved by the 
research ethics board at the University of Washington 
(UW). The GBD study shall be conducted in full 
compliance with UW policies and procedures, as well as 
applicable federal, state, and local laws.
All-cause mortality and causes of death
Mortality estimation methods are described in detail 
elsewhere.21,22 Briefly, all-cause mortality was estimated 
primarily from vital registration data, adjusted for 
completeness in Greece, Cyprus, and each of the other 
countries of western Europe, all of which had 
uninterrupted vital registration time series from 
pre-1990 to either 2014 or 2015. Spatiotemporal effects 
and covariates were used to extend estimates to 2016. 
Under-5 mortality and mortality for ages 15–59 years 
were estimated separately and linked using empirical 
life tables to derive age-specific and sex-specific all-cause 
mortality. The lowest observed risk of death for each age 
group in total populations of greater than 5 million was 
summed to construct a global standard life expectancy, 
which was 86·6 years at birth for GBD 2016.
Cause-specific deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) were 
estimated for underlying causes of mortality, ensuring 
that the sum of all specific causes is equal to all-cause 
mortality. Each death was assigned to a single cause. 
Vital registration and census death data were adjusted for 
incompleteness and misclassification (eg, prostate cancer 
in a female); non-specific and intermediate codes 
(eg, sepsis, heart failure, unknown causes) were redis-
tributed using age-specific, sex-specific, and geography-
specific 
statistical 
redistribution 
methods 
before 
modelling. The most commonly used estimation method 
was with the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm). 
CODEm uses a train-test-test approach, first testing all 
combinations of selected country-level covariates and 
their relation to in-sample data, then ranking those 
component models based on out-of-sample predictive 
validity to construct weighted ensembles. All ensemble 
models are again ranked on a second round of out-of-
sample predictive validity to select a final model. Cause-
specific fractions were multiplied by all-cause mortality 
estimates to calculate cause-specific deaths, then scaled 
with all other causes to match all-cause mortality. YLLs 
were calculated by multiplying age-specific deaths by 
global standard life expectancy at age of death.
Health expenditure
Methods for estimating total health expenditure, 
government health expenditure, out-of-pocket health 
expenditure, and prepaid public health expenditure 
have been described previously.26 Briefly, health 
spending data were extracted for 1995 to 2014 in national 
currency units and were divided by GDP reported by 
WHO, then multiplied by GDP per capita in 2015 
purchasing-power-parity-adjusted currency.26 We added 
a segmented correlation analysis (Spearman’s rank 
correlation coefficient) per financial period of interest 
(2000–09; 2010–14) to assess the relation between trends 
in health expenditure and all-cause mortality.27
Non-fatal health loss as expressed by YLDs
Epidemiological data from systematic literature reviews, 
health surveys, surveillance systems, disease registries, 
and hospital and claims databases were used to 
generate cause-specific and sequela-specific prevalence 
and incidence estimates using a variety of modelling 
approaches, of which Bayesian meta-regression compart-
mental modelling in DisMod-MR 2.1 was the most 
common.28 Disability weights for each unique health 
state were derived from population surveys of more 
than 60 000 respondents completed for GBD 2010 
and GBD 2013.29,30 A microsimulation framework was 
then used to adjust for comorbidity, and YLDs for each 
cause were calculated by multiplying prevalence and

corresponding disability weights for each sequela of 
each cause.23
Risk factor estimation and SEVs
The GBD 2016 comparative risk assessment (CRA) 
framework classified each of 84 risk factors and clusters 
of risk factors into one of three categories: behavioural, 
environmental and occupational, or metabolic. Data on 
risk factor exposure levels were identified, evaluated, 
and modelled using similar approaches to non-fatal 
models, with added emphasis on accurately fitting 
distributions of exposure for continuous and polytomous 
risk factors. Quantitative relative risk was estimated for 
each risk-outcome pair, and population attributable 
fraction statistics were calculated using standard GBD 
CRA methods.25 SEVs represent risk-weighted sums of 
total exposure in each population, scaled from 0 to 100.
Uncertainty estimation
Uncertainty for each metric was derived from 1000 draws 
from the distribution of each estimation step by age, sex, 
and location for each year included in the GBD 2016 
analysis; lower and upper uncertainty intervals (UIs) 
represent the ordinal 25th and 975th draws of each 
quantity. UIs allow final estimates to reflect the combined 
uncertainty of multiple modelling steps. UIs for mortality 
and YLLs reflect uncertainty in regression coefficients, 
uncertainty due to sampling and non-sampling error in 
the cause-of-death data, uncertainty due to various model 
specifications, and uncertainty in the levels of all-cause 
mortality. UIs for YLDs reflect uncertainty in prevalence 
estimates, distribution of severity within each cause, and 
disability weight valuations. Aggregation of uncertainty 
across age, sex, and location was done on each draw 
assuming no correlation.31

followed by a 2·72% (1·65 to 3·74) annualised increase 
from 2010 to 2016—a five-times greater ARC post-austerity, 
with evidence of continuing acceleration (table). The rise 
in the ARC for all-age mortality was also threefold higher 
in Greece post-austerity than the 0·86% (95% UI 
0·54 to 1·17) rise seen across western Europe for the same 
period, which was in the opposite direction of the global 
estimate of a 0·7% (–0·92 to –0·48) fall in all-age mortality 
from 2010 to 2016. The ARC for all-age mortality in Cyprus 
increased by 0·65% annually for 2010 to 2016, which was 
more favourable than regional and global estimates, but 
was still a retrogression compared with 2000–10 estimates 
(ARC –1·57% [–1·91 to –1·18]). In terms of age-standardised 
mortality, Greece’s ARC was among the worst-performing 
countries in western Europe from 2010 to 2016 (appendix), 
with a reduction from –1·61 (–1·91 to –1·30) from 2000 to 
2010 to a marginally negative ARC of –0·87 (–2·03 to 0·20).
Mortality trends in Greece were especially unfavourable 
in adults 15 years or older, with the largest increases seen in 
those aged 70 years or older (figure 1). Disaggregation of 
trends in age-specific mortality revealed that, although 
Greece had slower improvement than Cyprus and western 
Europe in most age groups from 2000 to 2010, the ARC of 
age-specific all-cause mortality was similar across all three 
locations in ages 15 and older from 2010 to 2016, albeit 
worse from birth to age 14 in Greece (appendix). In parallel, 
there was evidence of a rapid change in population structure 
from 2010 to 2016, with a reduction of population in age 
groups of 15–34 years and increases in population age 
groups of 55–59 years and 75 years and older (appendix). In 
comparison with Greece’s ageing population, all population 
age groups over 20 years of age in Cyprus recorded slight 
increases during the same period (appendix).
As for specific causes of death, adverse effects of medical 
treatment, self-harm, and several types of cancer stood 
out as consistently increasing in Greece across all ages 
(figure 2). Within specific age groups, other causes are 
apparent, with rapid increases in deaths due to neonatal 
haemolytic disease and neonatal sepsis in children 
younger than 5 years, and prominent increases in 
self-harm among adolescents and young adults. Greek 
adults aged 15–49 years had increased mortality due to 
HIV, several treatable neoplasms, all types of cirrhosis, 
neurological disorders (eg, multiple sclerosis, motor 
neuron disease), chronic kidney disease, and most types of 
cardiovascular disease except for ischaemic heart disease 
and stroke (appendix). This result contrasts with Cyprus, 
where drug use was the only top ten cause of death that 
increased in the 15–49 years age groups, and with western 
Europe, where no causes increased from 2010 to 2016. In 
adults aged 70 years or older, only a subset of causes of 
death increased in Cyprus and western Europe, but nearly 
all increased—and increased more rapidly—in Greece 
between 2010 and 2016 (appendix).

Health expenditure
Total health expenditure in Greece increased consistently 
from 2000 to 2008 (the year Greece’s austerity programme 
commenced), at which point total health expenditure was 
cut by US$130·32 per capita and has since remained in 
decline (figure 3). When assessing the associations 
between mortality rates and total health expenditure in 
Greece, two distinct patterns were observed: during the 
2000–08 period, an interrupted increase in total health 
expenditure was associated with a slow incremental 
increase in total mortality (Spearman’s rs=0·88), whereas 
from 2009 to 2014, this relationship was reversed 
(Spearman’s rs=–0·99) as the rate of increase in all-cause 
mortality hastened in the setting of compound decreases 
in total health expenditure. The same trend was noted for 
total health expenditure in Cyprus, but the cuts were not 
as substantial and there was a 1-year lag compared with 
Greece. Associations between total health expenditure 
and mortality were also different in Cyprus (appendix), 
because all-cause death rates decreased continuously 
until 2012. Examining more granular components of total 
health expenditure, including government, out-of-pocket, 
and prepaid public health expenditure revealed broadly 
similar trends (appendix). Prepaid public health expen-
diture dropped by 14% from 2008 to 2009, consistent 
with the onset of austerity measures, but increased to 
pre-austerity levels thereafter, which could be consistent 
with the pursuit of private health care due to inefficiencies 
of the public health system (appendix).
YLDs pre-austerity and post-austerity
Trends in non-fatal health loss were less dramatic than 
those of mortality. A consistent pattern for causes of 
YLDs was noted across Greece, Cyprus, and all of 
western Europe. Low-back and neck pain, migraine, 
depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and skin diseases 
were the top five causes of YLDs in all areas for both 
2000 and 2016, whereas oral disorders (caries of 
permanent teeth and chronic periodontal disease) and 
tension-type 
headache 
were 
the 
most 
prevalent 
conditions (appendix). HIV increased in both Cyprus 
and Greece from 2000 to 2016 in adults.
Risk factors
Age-standardised SEVs for each of the most detailed risk 
factors, which represent risk-weighted sums of total 
exposure in 2000, 2010, and 2016 show that Greece has 
higher exposure to several risks than either Cyprus or 
western Europe, including smoking, ambient ozone 
pollution, high body-mass index (BMI), and diet low in 
omega-3 and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Behavioural 
and metabolic risk factors accounted for the majority of 
attributable YLDs in Greece and Cyprus in 2016. The 
appendix shows the trends in age-standardised YLDs 
due to these factors from 2000 to 2016. In western 
Europe, 936·2 (663·2–1283·9) YLDs per 100 000 were 
attributable to metabolic risks in 2016, which was a 
slight decrease compared with 2010. The corresponding 
2016 
estimates 
for 
Greece 
and 
Cyprus 
were 
892·1 (632·3–1229·2) and 1055·2 (749·7–1436·4) per 
100 000 YLDs attributable to metabolic risks, respectively. 
The burden attributable to behavioural risks recorded a 
steady fall for western Europe and Cyprus from 2000 to 
2016, whereas an opposite trend was observed in Greece, 
with an overall increase of 2% in YLDs attributable to 
behavioural risks from 2000 to 2016. Disaggregation of 
metabolic risks revealed an increase in YLDs attributable 
mainly to high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, and 
high blood pressure in Greece since 2000. The risk 
attributable to tobacco continuously increased in Greece 
since 2000, ranking first among behavioural risks with a 
2·25% increase in YLD percentage attributable to 
tobacco from 2010 to 2016. Alcohol consumption and 
dietary risks ranked second and third, respectively. By 
contrast, during the same period, YLDs attributable to 
tobacco reduced by 8·1% in Cyprus and 13·2% in 
western Europe.
When paired with age-specific mortality rates to 
calculate smoking-attributable mortality, approximately 
70% of the 2016 gap in all-cause mortality between 
Greece and western Europe for ages 15–49 years could be 
attributed to excess smoking in Greece, whereas much of 
the remainder can be attributed to high BMI. For those 
aged 70 years or older, however, only 25% of the excess 
mortality in Greece could be attributed to smoking and 
approximately 15% to high BMI (figure 4).
Discussion
All-age mortality in Greece was stable from 1990 to 2000, 
began to increase from 2000 to 2010, and accelerated 
upward from 2010 to 2016. The inflection point around 
2010 was most pronounced in the very young and very 
old and, on aggregate, led to a 50% slowdown in the

reduction in age-standardised mortality in Greece since 
2010. Much of the increase in all-age mortality was 
concentrated in adults. Reasons for the increase included 
population ageing, a net fall in the number of young 
adults living in Greece, and a higher-than-average 
exposure to behavioural and metabolic risk factors. Many 
of the causes of death that increased in Greece are 
potentially responsive to care, including HIV, neoplasms, 
cirrhosis, neurological disorders, chronic kidney disease, 
and most types of cardiovascular disease. Improvements 
in child mortality in Greece have also stagnated 
since 2000, with increases in deaths due to neonatal 
haemolytic disease and neonatal sepsis since 2010, both 
of which might also reflect reduced health system 
performance.
Findings of reduced improvement in age-standardised 
mortality after austerity are consistent with those of 
Laliotis and colleagues,9 who also reported slowing of 
overall mortality reduction in Greece after the financial 
crisis despite differences in data sources and methods

incompleteness, misclassification, and comprehensive 
statistical modelling). Laliotis and colleagues also noted 
that those older than age 75 years had more negative 
effects than remaining adult age groups, identified a 
reversed epidemiological transition manifested as a 
nearly 10% increase in mortality due to communicable, 
maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases, and 
reported a worsening of mental health in Greece. The 
GBD 2016 findings of static child mortality also align 
with reports of increases in infant mortality and stillbirths 
post-austerity.32
Several plausible explanations could account for the 
trends of disease burden observed in Greece recently; 
the full explanation is probably multifactorial. First, 
population ageing in Greece preceded the economic 
crisis and could have contributed to the slow but 
measurable increase in all-cause mortality rates since 
2000. Acceleration of population ageing since 2010 
could be due to the massive emigration of early to 
mid-career educated professionals in pursuit of financial 
stability, in what has been referred to as brain drain.33 
Our findings for cause-specific mortality after 2010 do 
not support ageing as the only culprit, however, because 
increases were also noted in deaths due to neonatal 
haemolytic disease and neonatal sepsis in children 
younger than 5 years, self-harm among adolescents and 
young adults, HIV in young adults, and several treatable 
cancers in younger adults. At the same time, the 
demographic transition in Greece cannot be considered 
independent to the economic crisis, because emigration 
can be triggered by crisis-related increments in 
unemployment, reductions in wages, and stringent 
taxation schedules.33
Second, reversal in per-capita health expenditure in 
Greece in 2009–10, despite a continually ageing 
population that would have been expected to lead to 
increased spending, might have caused a fiscal and 
organisational shock to the health-care system. Since the 
implementation of the austerity programme, Greece has 
reduced its ratio of health-care expenditure to GDP to one 
of the lowest within the EU, with 50% less public hospital 
funding in 2015 than in 2009.34 This reduction has left 
hospitals with a deficit in basic supplies, while consumers 
are challenged by transient drug shortages.35 Concurrently, 
nearly a quarter of the population lost health insurance 
from the national health-care programme due to 
longstanding unemployment, while more than 20% 
reductions in the minimum wage reduced consumer 
buying power.34 Uncoupling of causes of health loss due 
to existing unhealthy behaviours and rooted inefficiencies 
of the health system from those due to the effects of 
austerity-related health policies is challenging and limited 
by data availability. Nonetheless, steep changes in health 
loss indicators since 2010 support a role of the austerity 
measures in accelerating the pre-existing health burden 
since 2000. Without careful mitigation and planning 
within the health-care system, large cuts could challenge 
the ability to maintain services at a level required to meet 
the growing health needs of an ageing population.17,36,37 
Constriction of health-care provision in Greece has been 
associated with a decrement in self-rated health following 
the onset of the austerity programme.13,38,39 The austerity 
measures were coupled with societal measures and 
structural reforms to ameliorate any adverse effects to the 
population’s wellbeing, but these reforms have not yet 
yielded a measurable effect on health burden.39
Third, elevated BMI, smoking, and unhealthy diet are 
increased in Greece, which is responsible for much of the 
excess mortality in adults aged 15–49 years compared 
with Cyprus and western Europe. However, age-
standardised mortality attributable to tobacco fell more 
quickly 
after 
austerity 
than 
before 
(–1·21% 
vs 
–1·36% annually), as did high BMI (–0·75% vs 
–1·52% annually), whereas the age-standardised mortality 
attributable to unhealthy dietary habits increased 
(–1·86% vs –0·88% annually). Although increasing 
trends in risk factors might be responsible for much of 
the excess mortality in younger adults, this study found 
that risk factors account for only a minority of the excess 
mortality in older adults. Furthermore, elevated BMI, 
smoking, and unhealthy diets could be linked to 
deficiencies in the establishment or implementation of 
health policies and social inertia, as well as direct and 
indirect effects of the economic crisis.3 Behavioural health 
policies encompassing health and nutrition education in 
Greece need improvement, with recent reports indicating 
the need for enhancement of nutritional services, 
reduction of disparities in health-care access, and 
expansion of limited rural primary care services40 to 
improve regional performance of areas such as the 
Aegean islands.41 Notably, the number of individuals with 
unmet health-care needs nearly doubled since 2010, with 
a considerable fraction reporting health-care cost as the 
main reason for not receiving the recommended 
health-care services.17 These reports point to a potential 
additive effect of the economic crisis to existing 
deficiencies in health services.
Fourth, and relatedly, risk factors associated with disease 
burden are also linked to region-specific inertias and 
could therefore extend beyond the structural deficiencies 
of the Greek health-care system. Greece has adopted the 
EU recommendation for smoke-free laws by setting one 
of the most stringent smoke-free policies among all EU 
countries, which called for completely banning smoking 
in enclosed public spaces.42 The implementation, however, 
has been largely unsuccessful.43,44 Interestingly, an analysis 
of the Hellas Health survey44 reported a 5% reduction 
in the prevalence of smokers in Greece from 
2008 to 2011. This reduction might be a joint result of a 
tobacco taxation programme and reduced spending 
power.44 The lack of a major effect of the crisis on health 
loss due to cardiovascular diseases, as reported by many 
investigators,17,44 might be explained by lifestyle changes 
related to the financial crisis, such as reduction in tobacco

usage following the increased taxation programme and 
increase of physical activity related to reduced usage of 
private transportation vehicles.17
Fifth, contemporaneous to the economic crisis, Greece 
has been hosting an increasing number of refugees from 
Syria notably, which could pose an additional challenge 
for national health and welfare systems and warrants new 
investigations on the effect on the national health status.
Similar to the slower reduction in health loss noted in 
Greece, Cypriot estimates showed that overall fatal health 
measures continued to decrease at a similar slower pace 
in the post-austerity era compared with 2000–10. ARC in 
age-standardised mortality fell at –0·86% post-austerity 
compared with –2·67% pre-austerity. Although Cyprus 
also implemented an austerity programme, the effect of 
the crisis on the health of residents of Cyprus as 
compared with those in Greece is consistent with the 
development of the economic crisis in each country. The 
Greek financial crisis was handled by an ongoing 
austerity programme based on taxation and broad cuts 
that still has not stabilised the economy or produced 
sustainable control of the deficit.38 By comparison, the 
austerity programme imposed in Cyprus in 2013 entailed 
an aggressive cut,45 that led to transient turbulence but 
was followed by a programme focused on growth and 
structural reform of the public sector, including the 
health-care system, which led to an early exit from the 
austerity programme for Cyprus.46
The trajectories of health outcomes in Greece and 
Cyprus in the post-austerity era offer valuable lessons 
for policy makers aiming to limit health effects in 
regions contemplating broad-based cuts. In Cyprus, 
austerity measures had direct effects on health care that 
aimed to increase the efficiency and sustainability of the 
national health-care system.46 The main health-care 
reform measures taken concerned establishing user 
charges (ie, co-payments), rationalising diagnostic 
examinations, and introducing guidelines to minimise 
waste of health resources.47 In Greece, austerity 
measures aimed directly at the reduction of the health-
care expenditure to GDP ratio without a structured plan 
for reform.48 Notably, Greece holds the second-highest 
rank among EU countries for the highest number of 
doctors per 1000 inhabitants, indicating the availability 
of a medical workforce that is not efficiently utilised.49 In 
addition to Greece and Cyprus, other European countries 
including Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Ireland have been 
faced with austerity measures or received bailout 
packages that affected their health-care systems. There 
were varying effects on population health among these 
countries. In Spain, mortality dropped during the 
economic crisis, whereas in Ireland male suicide rates 
increased by more than 50% following the onset of 
the crisis.14 The present analysis revealed that, when 
comparing age-standardised mortality rates among 
these countries that were affected by the regional 
financial crisis, there were varying trends for overall 
worse outcomes, which were more pronounced for 
Cyprus, Portugal, and Greece.
The present analysis shares the limitations of the 
GBD 2016 study, first and foremost the challenges of 
capturing all sources of uncertainty, lags in data 
availability, variation in coding practices and other biases, 
and limitations of existing analytical tools, which might 
not fully capture temporal trends in mortality, incidence, 
and prevalence. Second, and relatedly, these analyses are 
based on comparatively sparse data from more recent 
years, especially for non-fatal health outcomes. Third, 
lack of adequately matched information on health-care 
fund allocation by age and condition precluded analysis 
of its association with estimated health outcomes. It 
cannot be excluded that changes in population structure 
or indirect effects of the economic crisis and not the 
austerity-related reduction of GDP allocation to health 
care were the main drives of health loss in Greece. Fourth, 
although Cyprus and Greece share language and socio-
economic structures in general, other differences between 
them could bias our findings.
In conclusion, there is evidence of a disproportionate 
decrement in the health of Greeks compared with 
regional populations, which parallels the course of the 
economic crisis. From 2010 to 2016, Greece was faced 
with a five-times greater rate of annual all-cause mortality 
increase and a more modest increase in non-fatal health 
loss compared with pre-austerity. During the same 
period the ARC of age-standardised mortality reduced to 
nearly half the ARC for the 2000 to 2010 period. The 
findings of steep quantitative changes in mortality trends 
and qualitative changes in mortality causes with a rise in 
communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional 
diseases since 2010 suggest that an effect of the abruptly 
reduced government health expenditure on population 
health is likely. Nonetheless, the marginally negative 
ARC of age-standardised mortality reflects notable 
changes in population age structure in Greece when 
compared with the crude estimates for total mortality, 
probably related to emigration of young adults. There is a 
need for targeted studies to disaggregate the causes of 
accelerated pop 
ulation ageing and to determine the 
needs of the health-care system to cope with these 
changes in population structure. The findings of 
increases in total deaths and accelerated population 
ageing call for specific focus from health policy makers 
to determine the public health needs to cope with these 
changes.
