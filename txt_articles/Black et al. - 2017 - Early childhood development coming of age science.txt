Abstract
Early childhood development programmes vary in coordination and quality, with inadequate and 
inequitable access, especially for children younger than 3 years. New estimates, based on proxy 
measures of stunting and poverty, indicate that 250 million children (43%) younger than 5 years in 
low-income and middle-income countries are at risk of not reaching their developmental potential. 
There is therefore an urgent need to increase multisectoral coverage of quality programming that 
incorporates health, nutrition, security and safety, responsive caregiving, and early learning. 
Equitable early childhood policies and programmes are crucial for meeting Sustainable 
Development Goals, and for children to develop the intellectual skills, creativity, and wellbeing 
required to become healthy and productive adults. In this paper, the first in a three part Series on 
early childhood development, we examine recent scientific progress and global commitments to 
early childhood development. Research, programmes, and policies have advanced substantially 
since 2000, with new neuroscientific evidence linking early adversity and nurturing care with brain 
development and function throughout the life course.
Introduction
Two Lancet Series on Child Development in Developing Countries (2007 and 2011) 
spearheaded the review of evidence linking early childhood development with adult health 
and wellbeing. The finding that 219 million (39%) children younger than 5 years (under-5s) 
in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) are at risk of not reaching their 
developmental potential, leading to an average deficit of 19.8% in adult annual income,1 
attracted global attention.2 These two Series reviewed evidence related to key biological and 
psychosocial risks; summarised neuroscientific evidence on both adverse and positive 
experiences affecting early brain development; reviewed effectiveness of programmes and

 policies to improve early childhood development; provided the estimated costs of not 
investing in preschools; and concluded that inequities in development begin prior before 
conception, and that timely interventions reduce inequities and increase productivity 
(appendix pp 2).3–6
New evidence supports a life course perspective on childhood development and strengthens 
the conclusions and recommendations from the earlier Lancet Series, primarily through 
advances in neuroscience and longitudinal follow-up approaches. Poverty and adverse 
childhood experiences have long-term physiological and epigenetic effects on brain 
development and cognition.7–9 Neural processes, influenced by genetic and epigenetic 
variation, underlie the attachment and early learning systems, influencing subsequent health 
and development.10 Longitudinal follow-up studies among children exposed to poverty and 
other adverse conditions show beneficial effects of interventions on adult wage earning,11,12 
competence (eg, intelligence quotient, educational attainment, and general knowledge),13,14 
health biomarkers,15 reductions in violence, depressive symptoms and social inhibition,14 
and growth in the subsequent generation.16,17 These findings provide strong economic 
justification for investment in early childhood,18 especially in children younger than 3 years 
(under-3s).19
In response to the loss of human potential associated with early adversities, leaders from 
international organisations have issued urgent calls for strategies to ensure that young 
children reach their developmental potential.2 This Series responds to those calls. Paper 1 
proposes a life course perspective and the study of global commitments to early childhood 
development; Paper 2 examines evidence to implement and sustain effective early childhood 
development programmes at scale;20 and Paper 3 proposes models and strategies to promote 
early childhood development at scale.21 This Series focuses on the period from conception 
up to and including under-5s. Particular attention is given to children under the age of 3, 
because of the importance associated with the sensitivity and vulnerability of early brain 
development, the relative lack of attention to early childhood development in general during 
this period, and the potential for service delivery through the health, nutrition, and social 
protection sectors.
This first paper has five objectives: (1) to update the estimates of children at risk of not 
attaining their developmental potential; (2) to present a life course conceptual framework of 
early childhood development; (3) to assess global commitments and progress in early 
childhood development since 2000; (4) to examine access to centre-based and home-based 
early childhood development programmes; and (5) to describe cross-sectoral opportunities to 
implement early childhood development programmes.
Estimates of children at risk of not attaining developmental potential
Since the 2007 Lancet publication of the number of under-5 children in LMICs at risk for 
not reaching their developmental potential due to stunting and extreme poverty,1 definitions 
of stunting and extreme poverty have been updated, with improvements to the source data 
and estimation methods. As a result, the estimated number of children in LMICs at risk of 
not reaching their developmental potential, calculated in 2004, was revised from 219 million

 to 279 million.22 Between 2004 and 2010, the estimated number of children under 5 years in 
LMICs exposed to stunting or extreme poverty, and therefore at risk of not reaching their 
developmental potential, declined from 279.1 million (51% of children in 2004) to 249.4 
million (43% of children in 2010) (table 1).22 South Asia experienced the largest decline in 
both the number and prevalence of children at risk (from 110.9 million to 88.8 million, and 
from 65% to 53%, between 2004 and 2010). Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest prevalence 
of children at risk of not reaching developmental potential (70% in 2004 and 66% in 2010).
Population-level assessments measure the developmental status of populations and are used 
for monitoring global targets, such as UN Sustainable Development Goals. Stunting and 
extreme poverty serve as proxy measures because they are associated with children’s 
development, are measured globally using uniform methods, and are responsive to 
environmental and economic changes. Direct population-level assessments are advantageous 
due to their sensitivity to variations in children’s development and responsiveness to 
programmatic interventions. However, direct assessments are often costly and time-
consuming to measure, and might require developmental and cultural adaptations. Initial 
analyses using UNICEF’s caregiver-reported Early Childhood Development Index found 
that 36.8% of 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds in 35 LMICs do not attain basic cognitive and 
socio-emotional skills, such as following directions and inhibiting aggression.23 Efforts are 
underway to validate population-level measures that can be applied globally and used for 
monitoring progress in meeting targets from the Sustainable Development Goals for 
under-3s.24
Life course conceptual framework of early childhood development
Childhood development is a maturational and interactive process, resulting in an ordered 
progression of perceptual, motor, cognitive, language, socio-emotional, and self-regulation 
skills.25 Although the developmental process is similar across cultures, progression rates can 
vary as children acquire culture-specific skills.24 The acquisition of skills and learning in 
middle childhood, throughout adolescence, and into adulthood builds on foundational 
capacities established between preconception and early childhood, with multigenerational 
effects (figure 1).
Children reach developmental potential when they acquire developmental competencies for 
academic, behavioural, socio-emotional, and economic accom plishments. Multiple factors 
influence the acquisition of competencies, including health, nutrition, security and safety, 
responsive caregiving, and early learning; these domains interact with each other and can be 
mutually reinforcing through the process of development. All are necessary for nurturing 
care and occur through bi-directional interactions, initiated by both children and caregivers, 
and sustained by their environments.
Nurturing care is characterised by a home environment that is sensitive to children’s health 
and nutritional needs, responsive, emotionally supportive, and developmentally stimulating 
and appropriate, with opportunities for play and exploration and protection from adversities.
27 Positive associations between nurturing care and children’s health, growth, and 
development have been demonstrated worldwide,28,29 supported by neuroscientific evidence

 that nurturing care during early childhood attenuates the detrimental effects of low 
socioeconomic status on brain development.9,30,31
Informed by social ecology,15,26 nurturing care extends beyond families to include 
community caregivers and support for families.32 The systems model that forms the basis for 
our life course conceptual framework includes both an enabling environment for caregiver, 
family, and community, and an enabling social, economic, political, climatic, and cultural 
context (figure 1). The former represents personal resources, including maternal education 
and maternal physical and mental health, and community resources including safety, 
sanitation, and absence of stigma. The latter represents structural aspects, including policies, 
laws, supportive organisational systems and structures, and financial wellbeing, as well as 
wars, conflicts, droughts, and cultural variations. These multilevel components are mediated 
through nurturing care to influence children’s development.
Adversity, brain development, and protective influences
Early life adversities affect life course development, especially when multiple adversities 
such as poverty, nutritional deficiencies, high-crime communities, and low quality resources 
coincide.31 Neuroscientific evidence has documented associations between low 
socioeconomic status in early childhood and smaller hippocampal grey matter volume,9,30 
which together with low frontal and temporal lobe volume, might mediate associations 
between poverty and low cognitive, academic, and behavioural performance.33 Effects of 
being raised in poverty can extend to adulthood, resulting in low task-related activation of 
brain regions supporting language, cognitive control, and memory skills, and high activation 
of regions associated with emotional reactivity.31 Maternal nurturing care during early 
childhood can attenuate the detrimental effects of low socioeconomic status by protecting 
early brain development.8
Early brain development
Several environmental factors help explain socioeconomic status-based differences in brain 
development. Nutrients promote healthy brain development, with effects varying based on 
the timing, dose, and duration of access and deficiencies.34 Nutritional deficiencies before 
conception and during pregnancy can result in neural tube disorders, low birthweight and 
low birth-length, and lifelong developmental delays or disabilities.35 Although prenatal 
multiple micronutrient supplements benefit fetal growth, their effect on pregnancy outcomes 
and children’s subsequent development is inconsistent.36,37 Stunting before age 2 years is 
related to poor child development38 (panel 1). Improvements in height-for-age might occur 
after 2 years, but associations with cognitive gains remain uncertain.43,44,59
Nurturing care influences child development, and could attenuate the effects of adversity.
51,60 For instance, a randomised trial of foster care versus continued institutional placement 
among Romanian children in institutions found that the timing of foster placement relates to 
childhood stress hormone levels, a potential mediator between adversity and cognition 
(panel 1). The Romanian trial suggests that the negative effect of adversities can dysregulate 
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis early in life, but might be partially 
ameliorated by nurturing care.55

 Timing of interventions
Children’s early development is characterised by sensitive periods for skill development 
related to maturation and genetic–environmental interactions.61 The effect of interventions 
varies on the basis of sensitive periods related to specific experiences or environmental 
conditions (panel 1).59,61 For example, in Nepal, prenatal iron and folic acid 
supplementation was effective in producing positive downstream effects on school-age 
children’s cognitive and executive functioning performance,63 but iron and folic acid 
supplementation in children aged 12–35 months had no effect.64 Adoption studies suggest 
that after age 2 years, profoundly disadvantaged children are less sensitive to contextual 
improvements than younger children.59
In summary, the period between conception and age 2 years (1 000 days) is sensitive to 
nutrient effects on child growth, cognition, and subsequent school attainment.65 Poverty is 
associated with developmental delays before 12 months, with increasing deficits to 5 years,
41 illustrating that sensitive periods for economic adversity extend through at least age 5 
years. Additional neuro science and child development research is needed to understand 
optimal intervention timing.
Accumulation of adversities
Extreme poverty increases children’s likelihood of exposure to multiple adversities, 
including family stress, child abuse or neglect, food insecurity, and exposure to violence, 
which are often compounded by living in communities with limited resources. Accumulated 
adversities are often more detrimental to children’s development than single adversities, 
possibly because accumulated adversities could undermine children’s physiological response 
systems and inhibit self-regulation and stress management.66,67 Nurturing care depends on 
thriving families; adversities affecting families and the broader socioeconomic context could 
undermine the capacity of families to provide nurturing care.
Globally, large numbers of children experience multiple adversities or disabilities68 and live 
in fragile settings, such as refugees and displaced or migrant families. Many children have 
poor access to health care and education,69 parents living with HIV, depressed mothers and 
fathers,70 or are in institutions.71 Coordinated multisectoral, multilevel programmes might 
be necessary to reduce multiple adversities while enhancing protective factors and are 
discussed in Paper 2 of this Series.20
Global commitments to early childhood development
We examined changes since 2000 in global commitments to early childhood development 
using a policy process heuristic72 (figure 2). This heuristic assesses progress in five 
categories: agenda setting, evaluation, implementation, policy formation, and leadership and 
partnership.
We used five approaches to collect data related to the heuristic. First, we conducted a 2000–
14 literature review on early childhood development risk and protective factors6 to examine 
changes in the knowledge base (appendix pp 3–11). Second, we conducted a policy analysis 
regarding global political commitment to early childhood development that included 19

 semi-structured interviews with early childhood development leaders, and analysis of key 
documents. This analysis is further described in a Health Policy related to this Series.73 
Third, we conducted a programme analysis with leaders of governmental and non-
governmental early childhood development implementation and donor agencies, including 
searches of their annual reports to gather information on commitment to early childhood 
development (appendix pp 12–13). Fourth, we reviewed policies and investments in early 
childhood development in LMICs. Finally, we summarised our findings by assembling a 
timeline of major 2000–15 events related to early childhood development (figure 3).
Research in early childhood development
Since 2000, publication numbers increased for all topics reviewed, with stimulation 
(n=1121) and nutrition-related topics (stunting, n=508, and micronutrients, n=936) having 
greater publication numbers than malaria (n=255), maternal depression (n=139), or child 
abuse and neglect (n=298; figure 4). Comparing the 5 year period from 2010–14 with the 
2000–04 period, publications increased by factors of 2.0 for micronutrients, 2.9 for 
stimulation, 3.8 for stunting, and 6.9 for maternal depression. The doubling time for general 
health sciences publications is estimated at 8 years (2.4 over 10 years).74 The increase in 
publications concerning early childhood development and stimulation, stunting, or maternal 
depression was greater than the general trend. Despite recommendations for intervention 
research,3–6 only a few of the publications identified in the literature review reported on 
interventions (n=9, 6.3% for maternal depression and n=181, 19.3% for micronutrients).
Policy and programme analysis
The policy analysis with early childhood development leaders (detailed in the related Health 
Policy73) found that framing and governance were primary challenges for advancing global 
priority for early childhood development. Framing refers to how early childhood 
development is understood and conceptualised, including the definition of early childhood 
development, reliable and valid measures, and effective intervention strategies. The absence 
of clear framing impedes planning and progress as interested parties struggle to agree on 
basic issues. Governance refers to the actions established to implement and support early 
childhood development. The multisectoral nature of early childhood development is a 
challenge because governance is often spread across multiple sectors with limited 
accountability and ownership.
The programme analysis conducted with leaders of governmental and non-governmental 
implementation and donor agencies yielded similar findings, and were organised into a 
childhood development landscape representing the perspectives and recommendations of the 
interviewees, using the organisation of the policy heuristic (table 2). Two seemingly 
contradictory themes emerged under the category of agenda setting. In spite of grassroots 
and emerging political commitment to early childhood development programmes, 
interviewees expressed concern that early childhood development was neither well 
understood nor appreciated.75 Many recommended greater advocacy and clarity from the 
early childhood development community. Implementation concerns included equity and 
reaching the most vulnerable children and families, incorporating local contextual factors, 
monitoring, and attention to capacity and costing. Constraints noted among sectors that

 provide services to enhance children’s development were related to policy formation, 
including the necessity and challenges of multilevel intervention and coordination across 
sectors. Common themes in the category of evaluation were the need for rigorous 
evaluations and accountability, better evaluation tools, and funding for evaluation research. 
For leadership and partnership, partnerships were valued because they lead to networks, 
knowledge sharing, and gains for driving agenda and programme effectiveness.
Recommendations for strategies to enhance early childhood development programmes 
focused on defining early childhood development programmes and achieving individual and 
population equity. Common themes were stakeholder representation and urgent needs for a 
systems perspective on equity and rights, along with multisectoral policy planning, 
implementation, regulation, quality assurance, accountability, governance, attention to scale, 
and advocacy (table 2).76
Policies and investments related to early childhood development
Globally, many stakeholders have supported growth of early childhood development policy 
through financial and technical support for multisectoral policies, including strategic plans, 
guiding principles, and regulations.75 However, advances in early childhood development 
have often been stymied by fragmentation in existing policies, laws, and programmes.75
In 2000, seven LMICs had national multisectoral early childhood development policies. By 
July, 2014, 68 of 215 countries worldwide (constituting 45% of LMICs) had such policies 
(appendix pp 14).75 These statistics do not include early childhood development 
programmes without a unifying national policy. For example, Cuba does not have a unified 
national plan, but has substantial national multisectoral legislation that has achieved nearly 
full programme coverage for pregnant women, parents, and children (further discussed in 
Paper 3 of this Series).21
The World Bank initiative, Systems Approach for Better Education Results–Early Childhood 
Development (SABER–ECD), collects, analyses, and disseminates national and regional 
data on early childhood policies and programmes, serving as an important source of data on 
equity (appendix pp 15–16).77 Despite a multisectoral early childhood development policy 
in 63% of participating countries (22 of 35), 31% (11 of 35) lack an institutional anchor and 
59% (17 of 29) have no multisectoral operational manuals or integrated service delivery 
guidelines, indicating important gaps between policies and integrated implementation 
capacity.78
There has been substantial investment related to early childhood development since 2000. 
The Inter-American Development Bank has approved more than 150 projects for over US
$1.7 billion.77 From 2000 to 2013, the World Bank invested $3.3 billion in 273 projects, 
primarily through health, nutrition, and population programmes.80 Although these 
investments provide support for childhood development, they do not provide the responsive 
caregiving and opportunities for learning that children need. Investments were relatively 
stable from 2000 to 2011, with large increases after 2012, attributable to increased demand 
from countries and shifts in World Bank policy and internal capacity.80 These trends are 
promising, but additional investments tied to early childhood development are needed.

 Timeline of events related to early childhood development
Our timeline includes events from 2000–15 that informed regional or global early childhood 
development policy or practice (figure 3; appendix pp 17–23). Advances related to agenda 
setting and evaluation outnumbered implementation advances, with more advances in recent 
years (2012–15) than in the previous decade.
Global economic growth beginning in the 1990s lifted millions of people out of extreme 
poverty, resulting in reductions in nutritional deficiencies (as indicated by reductions in 
stunting) among children younger than 5 years. Based on World Bank figures, 896 million 
people worldwide lived on less than $1.90 per day in 2012, compared with 1.95 billion in 
1990. Implementation of global surveys, including the USAID Demographic and Health 
Surveys and the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, charted trends in child health 
indicators, enabling international agencies and countries to set targets and evaluate progress. 
As valid and reliable population-based indicators of early childhood development become 
available and are incorporated into global surveys, countries will be able to track progress in 
their children’s early development.
Access to activities and programmes promoting early childhood 
development
Home activities
Low-cost activities, such as storytelling, singing, and playing with household objects, expose 
young children to experiences that promote early development.81 According to Multiple 
Indicator Cluster Survey data from 2005–15, 48.4% of the nearly 230 000 3 year-olds and 4 
year-olds sampled had an adult read to them, and 67.7% had an adult either name or count 
objects within 3 days before the survey. These figures vary by wealth quintile within 
countries worldwide, with reading ranging from 62.4% in the top quintile to 36.4% in the 
bottom quintile. Home-based activities are likely to be even lower for children under 3 years. 
Of 320 000 children under the age of 5 sampled, 41.8% had home access to children’s 
books, with availability ranging from 56.6% in the top wealth quintile to 29.0% in bottom 
quintile families. Disparities in the number of home-based activities by country and wealth 
quintile (appendix pp 24) show the urgent need for global action to enhance family support 
for early learning. Subsequent surveys should expand information on home-based activities 
to children under 3 years.
Television and other media can increase home access to early childhood development 
programming aimed at either children or parents. Local versions of the educational 
television programme Sesame Street reach children in over 150 countries.82 In Bangladesh, 
almost 50% of 3–5 year-old children watched television daily,83 and among television 
watchers, 83% of urban and 58% of rural preschoolers watched Sesame Street. A meta-
analysis representing more than 10 000 children from 15 countries found significant benefits 
from watching Sesame Street in literacy and numeracy, health and safety, and social 
reasoning and attitudes toward others.84

 For children with developmental delays, disabilities, and atypical behaviours such as autism 
and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders, 81 countries provide national early 
childhood intervention. 47 (58%) of the countries providing national interventions are 
LMICs.68 Beneficial effects of early intervention up to and including 36 months have been 
shown in children in LMICs.85
Centre-based child care and preschool
Since 2000, child care enrolment for children under 3 years has increased substantially, 
especially in Latin America, where estimates of enrolled children exceed over 3.1 million.79 
In Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador, between 21% and 35% of children under 3 years 
are in child care.79 A review of child care programmes for children under 5 years in LMICs 
found that overall, programmes yielded positive but modest effects on children’s 
development, with no clear evidence for benefits to children’s health and nutrition.86
The effects of child care quality on children’s development vary, with stronger benefits 
among high quality programmes and potential for harm from poor quality programmes.87 
Quality is often divided into structural dimensions including infrastructure, caregiver 
training, and caregiver–child ratios; and process dimensions including caregiver–child 
interactions and opportunities for play and exploration. Process dimensions are critical for 
ensuring advances in child development. Through monitoring and planning, continuous 
quality assurance programmes are emerging.79
Access to preschool education was a central objective of Education for All.88 Attending 
preschool benefits children’s primary school performance,89 especially when preschool 
programmes include both education and nutrition.90 Preschool enrolment rates increased 
globally from 33% in 1999 to 54% in 2012, with particularly high rates in Latin America 
and the Caribbean.88 Although preschools are incorporated into the educational sector in 
many LMICs, almost one-third of children who attend preschool are enrolled in private 
institutions, often operating outside the regulatory system.79
Despite an impressive increase in preschool enrolment, according to UNESCO’s Global 
Monitoring Report, coverage ranges from 19% for low-income countries to 86% for high-
income countries, with highest enrolment among children from the highest wealth quintiles.
88 These trends are consistent with caregiver reports from the Multiple Indicator Cluster 
Survey. According to data from 164 900 children across 58 LMICs, 31.4% of all 36–59-
month-old children sampled had access to early education programmes, with preschool 
enrolment rates more than twice as high among children from the top wealth quintile 
(47.3%) compared with children from the lowest quintile (19.7%; figure 5).
Opportunities to coordinate early childhood development across sectors
The implementation of early childhood development programmes is often fragmented, 
particularly for children under 3 years, with confusion between multisector and integrated 
approaches. Multisector approaches include coordinated services across sectors, ideally with 
unifying policies.91 Integrated approaches refer to integration across services with shared 
messages and opportunities for synergy.92 Although there have been multiple calls for 
Black et al.

 integrated services,92 logistical issues remain.59 We outline here and in the appendix (pp 25) 
potential components of a multisector approach to early child development.
Health and nutrition
The health and nutrition sectors provide opportunities for coordinated early childhood 
development services in early life, as the main government services in regular contact with 
children from birth.3,4 Children who are undernourished or frequently ill are at high risk for 
developmental problems, emphasising the urgency of developing coordinated early 
childhood development programmes in collaboration with the health and nutrition sectors. 
Since 2000, there has been an expansion of knowledge synthesis, products, and evidence-
based interventions to address maternal, newborn, and child survival.93 Although health and 
nutrition interventions are necessary to promote child development, children need responsive 
caregiving and learning opportunities.59 Extending the emphasis on survival to include 
components of nurturing care and a life course perspective would ensure that children who 
survive also thrive.2
Home-based early childhood development activities are often implemented by community 
health workers and sponsored by health, nutrition, or social protection sectors, or through 
non-governmental organisations. There is a broad evidence base supporting home-based 
interventions to build parenting capacity, which links to child cognitive and socio-emotional 
development,5,6 with effects that extend to adulthood.14 Community health workers have 
made major contributions to health promotion globally.94 Although there are clear 
advantages to integrating child development with health and nutrition sectors, areas to 
consider include: feasible and scalable implementation strategies; personnel training and 
supervision on early childhood development; workload; logistics; compensation; and 
synchronised work schedules.95 Finally, the limited routine health and nutrition contacts 
beyond infancy might result in a 2–3 year service gap before preschool. Although several 
integrated programmes have shown beneficial effects on children’s development,96,97 
additional models are needed at scale.
Security and safety
The WHO 2014 Global Status Report on Violence Prevention includes data from 133 
countries on violence prevalence and prevention, including child abuse and neglect.98 
Despite global acceptance of child rights, recognition of the harmful effects of violence 
exposure and maltreatment on children, and endorsement of home visiting and parent 
education as effective in reducing risk factors for child maltreatment,99 there have been few 
evaluated programmes to protect children from violence and maltreatment in LMICs.98
UNICEF recommends a global prevention strategy with the following actions: (1) support 
caregivers; (2) help children manage risks; (3) change attitudes and norms that encourage 
violence; (4) provide support services for children; (5) implement child protection laws; and 
(6) conduct data collection and research.100 These recommendations are consistent with 
early childhood development programming. Ensuring that teachers in preschool and early 
primary school have appropriate training in classroom management can reduce aggression

 and violence towards and among children, illustrating that preschools can provide a platform 
for preventive interventions.101
Increasing numbers of children are refugees from conflict, climate change, and natural 
disasters.102 More than 50% of the 59.5 million displaced people documented in 2014 are 
children, many under age 5 years.102 The feasibility and potential benefits of integrating 
early childhood development activities into services for this vulnerable group have been 
demonstrated,103 and strategies are needed to ensure that services include such activities.
Responsive caregiving
Effective parenting programmes have been implemented in LMICs,3,4 providing evidence 
that methodologically rigorous parenting programmes can support the capacity of caregivers 
to provide the early learning environments that young children need. The evaluation of 
delivery models provides options for linking parenting programmes across sectors, and is 
discussed further in Paper 2 of this Series.20 Examples include delivery of home visits by 
community workers linked to health or social sectors,97 community-based group sessions,29 
and health centre-based programmes.96 Parenting programmes to improve early learning 
might also strengthen parents’ ability to manage child behaviour, support social-emotional 
development, and reduce child abuse and neglect.
Early learning and education
Early childhood development programmes and opportunities for early learning improve 
child outcomes during subsequent schooling.89 Coordination across preschools and primary 
schools promotes smooth transitions, enables children to build on their preschool skills, and 
facilitates a coordinated, sequential strategy for promoting early learning, which provides 
support for children across the life course.79
For the post-2015 agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals call for all children to have 
access to high quality pre-primary education. Achievement of this goal requires coordination 
of early childhood development programming within the education infrastructure,104 with 
attention to equity in both access and quality of services. The education sector has had 
limited focus on programmes for under-3s.42 Greater engagement of parents and caregivers 
in early childhood development programmes, coordination across sectors, and inclusive 
policies for children with disabilities are examples of strategies to maximise returns from 
early learning programmes and present young children and their families with better 
coordinated services.
Enabling environment for caregiver, family, and community
An enabling environment supports the family and caregivers as proximal providers of 
nurturing care. Support for caregivers’ nutrition and mental and physical health benefits 
children’s growth and development, and enhances caregivers’ receptiveness to parenting 
programmes.29 Attention to female education and gender equity builds capacity to promote 
child development and elicit necessary family support. Mothers and children benefit from 
shared caregiving that includes fathers and other family members.29 At a community level,

 clean and safe neighbourhoods, access to health and education services, and interpersonal 
community support strengthen the ability of families to provide nurturing care.
Social, economic, political, climatic, and cultural context
The social, economic, political, climatic, and cultural context can provide broad support and 
guidance for the implementation of family-friendly systems that enable nurturing care. 
Social protection programmes are designed to reduce poverty and provide opportunities to 
improve child development. Protection begins with birth registry, and continues through 
sustained investment in poverty alleviation, with the goal to reduce the inter-generational 
transmission of poverty (figure 1). A meta-analysis of the effects of multiple types of 
financial incentives on the coverage of child health interventions, targeting children under 5 
years in LMICs, found that the most promising programmes were those that removed 
barriers and increased access to services.105
Delivery strategies
Delivery strategies for early childhood development programmes are indicated (available to 
children identified by screening), selective (available to sub-populations at risk), or universal 
(available to all).106 The high prevalence of young children at risk for not reaching their 
developmental potential in some countries and regions (>40%) supports a selective approach 
to early childhood development intervention that reaches vulnerable groups of children, 
rather than devoting limited resources to individual screening. Universal, high quality 
programming that reaches all children living in communities characterised by extreme 
poverty or malnutrition might improve equity, and is discussed in Paper 3 of this Series.21
In many countries, early childhood development services are delivered through a disjointed 
set of primarily non-governmental organisations, often with few regulatory guidelines, 
limited attention to quality, and little coordination with other services or sectors.79 As the 
emphasis on early childhood has increased over the past decade and governments look to 
increase access to early childhood development programmes, finding effective ways to 
leverage the non-governmental sector to increase access and ensure quality is critically 
important. Platforms for early childhood development services range from home visits, 
clinical contacts, and community-based group sessions to new approaches, such as media. 
These platforms are discussed in more detail in Papers 2 and 3 of this Series.20,21 
Implementation research can aid in the scaling of evidence-based programmes by engaging 
stakeholders and opinion leaders, identifying core elements of evidence-based intervention, 
and focusing on quality assurance and cost-effectiveness, as discussed in Paper 3.21 
However, caution is warranted as the transition from science to practice often involves 
compromises.
Conclusions
Despite remarkable progress in early childhood development research, programmes, and 
policies, services for young children are inadequate and inequitably distributed. The burden 
of children not reaching their developmental potential remains high. The lack of attention to 
nurturing care as a comprehensive concept is a major concern, especially during the period

 of rapid brain development and learning, and the formation of caregiver–child attachments 
that characterises children under 3 years.
The conceptual basis of early childhood development has been well established (figure 1). 
The underlying science of early childhood development and the life course framework 
illustrate the crucial part that early childhood development plays, enabling children to 
become healthy and productive citizens with the intellectual skills, creativity, and wellbeing 
to reduce global inequities and ensure sustainable global development. However, the 
application of policy heuristics to existing evidence has shown that implementation of early 
childhood development programmes is fragmented and lacks coordination, especially for 
children under 3 years (panel 2).
Investment in early childhood development is increasing through advances in the health, 
nutrition, and social protection sectors, through programmes that promote survival, 
nutritional adequacy, and poverty reduction, respectively. Although these interventions 
provide benefits for early childhood development, they do not ensure that children reach 
their developmental potential. The advances in personal and societal equity that have been 
attributed to early childhood development require that interventions also include 
opportunities to promote all components of nurturing care through the family, with support 
from communities and social, economic, political, climatic, and cultural contexts. Nurturing 
care in early childhood is the essential foundation for human capital development and should 
be followed by high quality schooling, support for at-risk youth, and programmes to 
facilitate the school-to-work transition.79
Early childhood development services are necessary to address the enormous global burden 
of children in LMICs who are not reaching their developmental potential and who will 
experience lifelong disparities in health, academic achievement, and earning potential. There 
is an urgent need for population-level indicators of child development, especially for the 
youngest children, to enable ongoing monitoring and improvement in quality.24 Achieving 
the Sustainable Development Goals depends on ensuring adequate health, nutrition, security 
and safety, responsive caregiving, and early learning opportunities for the youngest children.

 Key messages
•
The proportion of children younger than 5 years in low-income and middle-
income countries at risk of not attaining their developmental potential because 
of extreme poverty and stunting remains high (43%).
•
The accumulation of adversities, beginning before conception and continuing 
throughout prenatal and early life, can disrupt brain development, attachment, 
and early learning. Developmental delays are evident in the first year, worsen 
during early childhood, and continue throughout life.
•
Despite substantial progress in early childhood development research, 
programmes, and national policies since 2000, services are of varying quality 
with uncoordinated and inequitable access, especially for children younger 
than 3 years.
•
Children’s early development requires nurturing care—defined as health, 
nutrition, security and safety, responsive caregiving, and early learning—
provided by parent and family interactions, and supported by an environment 
that enables these interactions.
•
Coordination, monitoring, and evaluation are needed across sectors to ensure 
that high quality early childhood development services are available 
throughout early childhood and primary school, up to the age of 8 years.
•
Action at global, national, and local levels is needed to increase political 
commitment to and investment in early childhood development.

 Panel 1
Sensitive periods for the association of adversities with early childhood 
development
Stunting
•
Evidence from low-income and middle-income countries suggests that the 
prenatal period39 and the first 24 months after birth40–42 are the most sensitive 
times for stunting to be associated with later cognition, executive function, 
and school attainment; after 24 months the association is not as strong.38,41
•
Some catch up is possible in height-for-age after 24 months, with uncertain 
cognitive gains.43,44
•
Macronutrient supplementation studies generally confirm the importance of 
the first 24 months for intellectual development.45 Early supplementation has 
long-term benefits to wages, but no benefit occurred with supplementation 
after 36 months.12
Poverty
•
Poverty is associated with deficits in language and cognition at 3 years that 
are larger at 5 years of age.46–48
•
Deficits are evident from the first year of life, with deficits in executive 
function observed in Argentinian infants aged 6 to 14 months,49 and 
developmental deficits observed in infants between 3 and 23 months of age in 
India, Indonesia, Peru, and Senegal.50 Deficits in language and cognition 
were found at 10 to 12 months of age in Colombian children, with deficits 
increasing up to 42 months.47
•
A longitudinal Bangladeshi study found a 0.2 SD deficit in cognition between 
the top and bottom wealth quintile at age 7 months that increased to 1.2 SD of 
intelligence quotient (IQ) by 63 months. The effect of poverty was mostly 
mediated (86%) by parental education, the quality of the home environment, 
and prenatal and postnatal linear growth up to 2 years. After 24 months, 
growth had only a small effect on IQ, whereas the home environment had a 
substantial positive effect up to 63 months.41
•
Changes in poverty level after age 36 months affect cognitive development 
and executive function.51
Severe psychosocial deprivation
•
Being in a residential institution is an example of profound deprivation. A 
randomised trial of placing Romanian children (aged 5–31 months) from 
institutions in quality foster care, or keeping them in the institution, presents a 
unique opportunity to examine sensitive periods in childhood development.
•
Children in quality foster care improved in IQ (at 8 years),52 attachment (at 
42 months),53 and electroencephalogram power and coherence (at 8 years),54

 compared with children remaining in institutions. Children placed before 24–
26 months showed a more improved stress response (at 12 years),55 language 
(at 42 months),56 and mental health (at 54 months),57 than children placed 
later.
•
Children who remained in the institutions had a blunted stress response. 
Children fostered before 24 months improved in their cortisol response and 
children fostered before 18 months improved in their parasympathetic 
response.55
•
Children fostered before age 15 months caught up with their environmental 
peers in language development; children placed after 24 months had less 
improvement.56
•
Internalising problems improved but time of placement had no effect, and 
there was no improvement in externalising disorders.57
•
Children in institutions had changes in brain microstructure white matter; 
foster care was associated with some improvement in the microstructure, 
regardless of placement time.58

Table 2
Perspectives and recommendations on the early childhood development landscape
Perspective on trends
Recommendations
Agenda setting
Subtle impacts of early childhood development (ECD) 
interventions inhibit advocacy
There is a lack of understanding about what ECD 
programmes entail beyond preschool
Limitations include insufficient: funding, evaluation, 
implementation science, political commitment, and 
stafftime and training
Improve data availability, quality, frequency, and 
dissemination relating to ECD, particularly for 
children 0–3 years
Improve integration and multisectoral coordination of 
ECD with other sectors
Receive guidelines from the ECD community on 
programming, coordination, and integration strategies
Implementation
ECD programmes promote equity; there has been 
increased emphasis on vulnerable populations, 
including children with disabilities, and children 
affected by HIV and AIDS
ECD programmes target children aged 4 to 5 years and 
older, with a recent focus on children 0–3 years
Leverage universal population-based interventions for 
children younger than age 5 years (especially younger 
than age 3 years), in areas where prevalence of 
disadvantaged children is high
Increase access for evidence-based programmes and 
policies
Improve strategies to reach disadvantaged children and 
geographically remote or underserved areas
Design programmes to be scalable and sustainable
Policy formation
ECD programmes are integrated with other 
programmes (eg, nutrition, maternal and child health)
Coordinating among ministries and sectors requires 
ECD to resonate with ministry priorities
Estimate costs of ECD interventions, assess cost-eff 
ectiveness, and conduct projections to maximise 
investment in children and families
Evaluation
Donors are demanding rigorous and results-driven 
approaches
Growing neuroscience knowledge, and evidence of 
increases in economic productivity and reductions in 
poverty as a result of ECD justify increased 
investments in ECD programmes
ECD programmes have increased in scale over the past 
10–15 years
Implement rigorous and systematic data collection and 
systems of accountability
Define a core set of ECD indicators that, with 
adaptation, can be used globally, regionally, and 
nationally for monitoring, planning, and assessment
Increase support for national ECD policies and 
implementation plans
Leadership and partnership
There is a growing cadre of stakeholders and staff who 
advocate for ECD programmes
Partnerships among donors are important for agenda 
setting and increasing programme effectivenes
Sustainability and cost-effectiveness promote 
investment
Identify sustainable funding mechanisms at multiple 
levels (eg, international, national, or municipal)
Establish strong and eff ective coordinating 
mechanisms for sectors that contribute to ECD 
outcomes
Promote political commitment by linking science to 
practice in ECD by improving understanding of the 
most recent evidence-based practices

2000–15.
