Abstract
Background
Adverse effects of prenatal stress or environmental chemical exposures on fetal growth are
well described, yet their combined effect remains unclear.
Objectives
To conduct a systematic review on the combined impact and interaction of prenatal expo-
sure to stress and chemicals on developmental outcomes.
Methods
We used the first three steps of the Navigation Guide systematic review. We wrote a proto-
col, performed a robust literature search to identify relevant animal and human studies and
extracted data on developmental outcomes. For the most common outcome (fetal growth),
we evaluated risk of bias, calculated effect sizes for main effects of individual and combined
exposures, and performed a random effects meta-analysis of those studies reporting on
odds of low birthweight (LBW) by smoking and socioeconomic status (SES).
Results
We identified 17 human- and 22 animal-studies of combined chemical and stress exposures
and fetal growth. Human studies tended to have a lower risk of bias across nine domains.
Generally, we found stronger effects for chemicals than stress, and these exposures were
associated with reduced fetal growth in the low-stress group and the association was often
greater in high stress groups, with limited evidence of effect modification. We found smoking
associated with significantly increased odds of LBW, with a greater effect for high stress
(low SES; OR 4.75 (2.46–9.16)) compared to low stress (high SES; OR 1.95 (95% CI 1.53–

effect modification.
Conclusions
We found that despite concern for the combined effects of environmental chemicals and
stress, this is still an under-studied topic, though limited available human studies indicate
chemical exposures exert stronger effects than stress, and this effect is generally larger in
the presence of stress.
Introduction
Both prenatal psychosocial stress and exposure to exogenous environmental chemicals have
been found to be independently associated with increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes,
including low birth weight, gestational hypertension and preterm birth. Significant stress-
related risk factors which have been reviewed systematically and found to affect pregnancy
and developmental outcomes include: racial disparities and discrimination [1, 2], poverty [3],
and psychological distress such as depression or anxiety [4]. Moreover, relaxation techniques
during pregnancy have been found to improve pregnancy outcomes [5]. Similarly, there is a
separate body of evidence finding associations between the adverse pregnancy outcomes and
exogenous chemicals such as lead [6, 7], pesticides [8, 9] and cigarette-smoke [10, 11]. While
there is robust evidence of an association between either psychosocial stress or chemical expo-
sures and adverse pregnancy outcomes, the effects of their cumulative or combined exposure,
often referred to as a form of “double jeopardy” [12], remain unclear.
Adverse pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight, gestational hypertension and pre-
term birth are associated with greater perinatal mortality and morbidity, neurodevelopmental
disabilities and other complications which span a lifetime including adult onset cardiovascular
and metabolic disease [13–17]. Preterm birth has increased steadily over the last twenty years
and only recently plateaued. However both preterm birth and low birth weight are still rela-
tively prevalent at 11% and 8% respectively in 2012 [18], with consequential economic and
societal burden [19]. Thus there remains an urgent need to understand all of the risk factors
that contribute to these complications.
The majority of epidemiologic studies assess the impact of individual chemical exposures,
or groups of similar exposures, such as multiple traffic-related air pollutants; however pregnant
women are exposed to a plethora of both exogenous environmental chemicals at varying doses
[20], and psychosocial stressors [21]. The importance of the cumulative effects of chemical and
stress exposures has been identified as a key research need [22, 23] and while there is general
acknowledgement that there is likely to be a cumulative effect, to our knowledge there has
been no systematic review of the human and animal evidence that holistically evaluates scien-
tific findings regarding whether combined exposures to chemicals and stress are worse than
either alone, and if there interactive effects. Advancing our knowledge in this area will enhance
understanding about the complexity of risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes and
inform interventions, such as whether targeting one or the other during the prenatal period is
sufficient to reduce the likelihood of adverse health impacts.
We conducted a systematic review of the literature assessing the impact of psychosocial
stress and environmental chemicals on developmental outcomes in humans and mammals.
Our aim was to evaluate whether combined exposure to both prenatal stress and exogenous

 chemicals exerted a stronger effect on development outcomes compared to either exposure
alone, and, if there is a combined effect, whether there is an interaction. Specifically we sought
to: (1) identify all of the relevant human and non-human mammalian studies; (2) extract rele-
vant outcome data and rate the quality of studies; (3) analyze and report the magnitude of the
main effects of individual and combined exposures to chemicals and stress and their
interaction.
Methods
To assess the scope of the literature on this topic, we adapted and applied the first three steps
of the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology for environmental health [24] to
assess the strength of evidence for the combined effect of prenatal stress and chemical exposure
on fetal growth. We conducted our systematic review as outlined a priori in a protocol which
is available online (http://www.dcn.ed.ac.uk/camarades/research.html#protocols) and summa-
rized below. The PRISMA checklist can be found in S1 Table. For the scope of this we review,
we focused on the first three steps of the Navigation Guide in order to systematically identify
the current literature on this topic, assess the internal validity of the literature, and evaluate
potential combined and interactive effects across studies. We defined stress as markers or sur-
rogate indicators of potential prenatal stress exposures that that could result in adverse devel-
opmental outcomes in offspring.
Step 1. Specify the study question
We used a ‘PECO’ (Participants, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome) aid to outline the study
question [24]. Our aim was to answer the following questions: (1) ‘does exposure to both pre-
natal stress and exogenous chemicals result in a worsening of developmental outcomes com-
pared to either exposure alone’; and (2) ‘is there an interaction between prenatal exposure to
exogenous chemicals and stress on developmental outcomes’. To answer to these questions we
evaluated the combined effect of prenatal stress and exogenous chemicals, with a goal of assess-
ing whether they were additive (question 1), and then whether they were multiplicative (ques-
tion 2).
Population: Humans or animals (non-human mammals; hereafter referred to simply as
“animals”) that are studied during the reproductive or developmental time period, specifically
before and/or during pregnancy for females or during development for fetuses.
Exposure(s): (1) Any quantified exogenous chemical exposure before or during pregnancy,
and in the same study (2) exposure to chronic psychosocial stress in humans, or equivalent in
animals, during the same developmental period. We defined the universe of exogenous chemi-
cal exposures as those that are generally addressed by USEPA, and include manufactured
chemicals and chemical byproducts (e.g. air pollution) and smoking. A list of chemical expo-
sure terms is included in our protocol in the search term. We defined stress to include major
life events, as well as extrinsic sources of stress related to individual-level or place-based mea-
sures of material deprivation, poverty, and other indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) or
social position.
For our review, we considered three exposure groups (Table 1):
1. Humans exposed to high levels (as defined using the method outlines in the section “Expo-
sure and comparator categorisation”) of both the exogenous chemical and psychosocial
stress or animals administered a chemical and subjected to a stress condition;
2. Humans exposed to high levels of the exogenous chemical and low levels of stress, or ani-
mals administered a chemical and not subjected to the stress condition;

 3. Humans exposed to low levels of the exogenous chemical and high stress, or animals
untreated or administered vehicle and subjected to the stress condition.
Comparators: Humans exposed to low levels of both the exogenous chemical and psychoso-
cial stress during the same developmental period, or animals not treated with the chemical and
not subjected to the stress condition (vehicle controls).
Outcomes: Measures of fetal growth including birth weight, and/or measures of size such as
birth length, head or abdominal circumference; preterm birth and/or gestational age; develop-
mental outcomes within the first twelve years (humans) or before adulthood (animals).
Step 2. Select the evidence
Search methods.
We used known relevant articles on the effect of either exogenous chem-
icals or stress to populate a list of relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) which we
expanded using the MeSH tree in Pubmed. This yielded a list of key MeSH terms and key-
words (see online protocol). We searched four online databases on April 18th 2013 (Pubmed,
ISI Web of Science, Biosis Previews, Embase). In addition, we conducted a second search in
Pubmed on May 29th 2013 using additional MeSH terms and keywords from relevant articles
identified in the first search. Finally, we hand searched the reference list of all studies included
in the systematic review to identify additional relevant studies. Our search was not limited by
date or language.
Study selection criteria.
We based our inclusion and exclusion criteria on the study ques-
tion and the characteristics described in the ‘PECO’ aid. One reviewer (HV) screened titles
and abstracts of the search results against the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table 2) using a

 custom form in Distiller SR (Evidence Partners; available at http://systematic-review.net). A
second reviewer (HS) independently screened 20% with no discrepancies between reviewers.
The vast majority did not meet the inclusion criteria. Studies which either met the inclusion
criteria or for which eligibility could not be determined from titles and abstracts alone were
taken forward to the full text screen. One reviewer performed the full text screen (HV).
Data collection.
One reviewer (HV) extracted relevant data pertaining to the publication
(unique reference ID, first and corresponding authors, year of publication, type of publication
(full or meeting abstract), the exposures (the exogenous chemical and stressor, dose or other
measure of exposure), and the endpoints (the outcome measure, sample size per group, a mea-
sure of central tendency, incidence or odds ratio, a measure of variance (standard deviation
(SD), standard error of the mean (SEM) or 95% CI), the sex of the offspring, and the time of
assessment relative to day of birth (day zero). For animal studies we additionally extracted data
on the route of administration and timing of administration (relative to gestational day zero),
the species and strain.
Where data were missing or incomplete we made up to two attempts to obtain the informa-
tion directly from study authors.
Exposure and comparator categorization.
For animal studies we took groups adminis-
tered the chemical and/or a stress condition as an exposed group, and any untreated or vehicle
administered group without the stress condition as the comparator group. For human studies
we dichotomized stress exposure variables into “high” and “low” as detailed in Table 3, and
pooled the means and variances using previously described methods [Chapter 7 from 25].
Step 3. Assess the risk of bias of each individual study
We used the Navigation Guide risk of bias tool for human and animal studies which has been
previously described [38, 39]. Five domains were the same for both human and animal studies:
blinding; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; conflicts of interest; and any
other sources of bias. Additionally for human studies we assessed recruitment strategy; expo-
sure assessment and confounding, and for animal studies we assessed sequence generation.

sures can be found in the original studies which are listed by citation number.

 Further information on these domains are provided in the study protocol (http://www.dcn.ed.
ac.uk/camarades/research.html#protocols). For each domain we assigned a rating of “low
risk”, “probably low risk”, “probably high risk” or “high risk”. Definitions of the domains were
the same as in [40] and [41].
Step 4. Quantitative evaluation of effects of combined exposures
We conducted a quantitative analysis on developmental endpoints in humans and animals
which were reported in five or more human studies; only outcomes on fetal growth met this
criterion. Specifically, we evaluated data from human studies on birth weight, relative change
in or odds of low birth weight; and from animal studies on fetal weight, birth weight or postna-
tal weight. Accordingly, we focused our first study question (above) on fetal growth, which
became:
• Study question 1: Does exposure to both prenatal stress and exogenous chemicals result in a
decrease in growth compared to either exposure alone?
For this question, we focused on evaluating the additive effects of the chemical exposures
and psychosocial stress. Accordingly, to assess this question, we proposed two null hypotheses
and required both to be rejected; (1) combined exposure does not result in a significant
decrease in growth compared to chemicals alone; and (2) combined exposure does not result in
a significant decrease in growth compared to stress alone. We used these criteria as follows:
Since birth weight is more naturally analyzed on the log scale, we calculated the logarithm
of ratios of means. Specifically, for human and animal data on birth weight or odds ratios of
low birth weight, we took the natural logarithm ratio of the mean values in the combined expo-
sure group to the mean in each of the individual exposure groups separately: We used the fol-
lowing formulae to calculate the effect size, �
yij;
�
yij ¼ log �
x11
�

!
where i and j represent stress and chemicals respectively, and take on values of 1 (presence)
and 0 (absence). Thus, the reported mean birth weight or odds ratio is represented by �
x11 in
the combined stress and chemical group, �
x01 in the chemical group, and �
x10 in the psychosocial
stress group.
We used the Delta method to transform the standard errors to the log scale and calculated a
pooled standard error [42];

We calculated 95% CI on the natural log scale and transformed these and the effect size
back to the original scale by exponentiation (using the exp function in Microsoft Excel (2010)).
We rejected either null hypothesis if the effect size was significantly different from one (no
effect).
Similar to above, we focused our second study question on fetal growth, which became:
• Study question 2: Is there an interaction between prenatal exposure to exogenous chemicals
and stress as it affects decrements in fetal- or early-life growth?
To assess this question, we evaluated the extent to which there was a multiplicative effect of
chemical exposures and stress. To do this, for each data type (e.g. odds ratio or mean birth

 weight), we calculated the main effects for each exposure group separately and then calculated
their interaction.
For mean birth weight in humans or gestational, birth, and postnatal weights in rodents, we
calculated the magnitude of the main effects on the natural log scale using the formula;
yij ¼ log �
x00
�
xij
 
!
where �
xij is as defined above, and �
x00 is the reported mean birth weight in the control group.
We used the Delta method to transform the standard errors to the log scale and calculated a
pooled standard error:

Next we calculated the interaction term as follows:

ing formula on the logarithmic scale;
Defining zij ¼ logð�

Finally, we calculated 95% CI on the natural log scale as described above, exponentiated the
values back to the original scale and assessed whether the interaction was significantly dif-
ferent from one.
2. For odds ratios reported or calculated with respect to a common reference group (x00), we
compared the odds ratio for the combined effect to the multiplication of the odds ratios for
each effect. We calculated the magnitude of their interaction using the formulae for relative
risks as described previously [43]:

We exponentiated the main effects and interaction back to the original scale to assess

 3. For data reported as odds ratios with separate reference groups (i.e. assessing chemical
effects in low versus high stress groups), we took the reported odds ratios as the main effects
of the chemical and combined exposures respectively. We calculated their interaction by
dividing the odds ratio for the combined exposure group by the odds ratio in the chemical
group.
Meta-analysis.
We conducted a meta-analysis on the effect of individual and combined
exposure to smoking and low SES on the odds of LBW. We focused on smoking studies,
because studies on other chemicals were too few in number to conduct a robust meta-analysis.
Specifically we used the metan function in Stata (version 11) and used a random effects model
to account for anticipated heterogeneity in exposure assessment. We did not formally assess
for publication bias due to the small number of included studies.
Results
Included studies
We identified 13997 studies in our initial literature search (April 2013) and a further 2783
studies from a second search of Pubmed in May 2013. In total we excluded 4886 duplicates
and screened the titles and abstracts of the remaining 11894 studies. Of these, 11564 did not
meet the inclusion criteria, leaving 330 publications which were included in the full text screen.
A further 267 full texts were excluded based on criteria, leaving 63 relevant studies for inclu-
sion in the systematic review. Hand searching the reference list of these studies identified an
additional six relevant studies. We identified two mammalian studies which appeared to report
duplicative data and thus we excluded both studies from the analyses. In total we identified 69
relevant studies reporting on the main effects of chemical and stress exposures individually
and combined on any developmental outcome (Fig 1). These were comprised of 34 human
studies (all full publications) and 35 animal studies (32 full publications and 3 meeting
abstracts not published in full). The median year of publication was 2002 (interquartile range
(IQR) 1996 to 2007). We included 17 human and 22 animal studies measuring fetal growth in
our quantitative analysis of main effects and interactions (see below for details).
We identified 16 unique exogenous chemicals of which the most commonly reported were
smoking, with 24 human studies [26, 29, 31–37, 44–58], and alcohol, with 3 human [32, 36,
55] and 11 animal studies [59–69] (Table 4). There were four studies each on air pollution (3
human [27, 28, 70], 1 animal [71]), lead (1 human [72], 4 animal [73–76]), and perfluoroocta-
nesulfonic acid (4 animal [77–80]). The remaining 9 chemicals studied were reported in three
or fewer studies [30, 59, 81–98]. We identified 14 measures of psychosocial stress exposures,
all of which were unique to either humans or animals (7 exposure measures each). In human
studies, stress exposures relating to socioeconomic status (e.g., family income, social class and
education attainment level) were most common (n = 22 studies [26, 28–35, 45–47, 49, 50, 52,
56, 58, 70, 72, 82, 83, 85]), followed by race (n = 10 [26–28, 44, 48, 53–55, 57, 84]). In animal
studies, restraint stress alone was the most commonly studied stress condition (n = 27 [59, 60,
62, 65–67, 69, 73–80, 86, 87, 89–91, 94–100]). The remaining five human stressors and six ani-
mal stressors were reported in three or fewer studies (Table 4).
In these studies, outcomes on growth were reported most often: 17 human studies reporting
on birth weight, reduction in birth weight, odds of low birth weight or small for gestational
age; and 23 animal studies reporting on fetal weight before term, at term, or postnatally. Across
all human studies, we identified 6 additional groups of outcomes: viability (n = 3), prematurity
(n = 4), birth defects (n = 2), cognitive learning (n = 2), sensory response (n = 1) and “other”

 (n = 2) which included odds of childhood obesity and probability of high physical aggression
(Fig 2). Across all animal studies, measures of viability (e.g. litter size, number of resorptions)
(n = 22 studies) and sex ratio (n = 10) were assessed frequently.
Due to low overlap between chemical and stress exposures reported between animal and
human studies, in the following sections we have reported on these separately.
Risk of bias for individual studies
The risk of bias assessment was conducted on fetal growth outcomes studies as these were
most commonly reported with evidence amenable to quantitative assessment of combined
exposure effects (Fig 3).
Table 4. Chemical and stress exposures assessed included 69 human and animal studies on developmental outcomes from combined exposure.
The sum of the number of studies for either exogenous chemical or psychosocial stress is greater than 69 because some studies reported more than one
stressor variable. Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of studies which were included in the quantitative review. Under the stress/stressor exposure,
“multiple stressors” refers to a random schedule administered in two rat studies consisting of exposure to each of the following stressors: mouse cage, food &
water deprivation, empty water bottle, damp bedding, cage tilting, noise, crowding, alone in cage, alone in cage, no bedding and new partner [92, 93].

 Human studies (N = 17).
In general, we found that the studies had low or probably low
risk of bias across the domains (Fig 3). For example, most studies were low risk of bias for
recruitment strategy (71%), exposure assessment (82%), robust outcome assessment (94%),
selective outcome reporting (88%) and other sources of bias (94%). For blinded assessment of
outcome we found that 6% had a low risk of bias and the remaining 94% had a probably low
risk of bias. We did find more studies had a probably high risk or high risk of bias for recruit-
ment strategy (24%), confounding (35%), incomplete outcome data (35%), and financial con-
flict of interest (41%). Three studies were given high risk of bias ratings for either recruitment
strategy, incomplete outcome data, conflicts of interest or other sources of bias (Fig 3A).
Non-human mammalian studies (N = 22). Across seven risk of bias domains, we found
that studies were more likely to have probably high or high risk of bias, particularly across the
domains of allocation concealment (100%), blinding (87%) and incomplete outcome reporting
(82%) (Fig 3B). We found that all studies were rated low risk for selective outcome reporting
and other sources of bias, and most studies were rated as low or probably low risk for sequence
generation (64%) and conflicts of interest (73%).
Summary of findings from human studies
Seventeen studies reported on measures of birth weight including birth weight itself (n = 5
studies), reduction in birth weight (n = 4), incidence of low birth weight (n = 4), odds of low
birth weight (n = 5), and odds of small for gestational age (n = 1; this study also reported on
odds of low birth weight).
Main effects of chemical exposure (low stress).
Human studies on fetal growth outcomes
were available for 12 chemicals, of which studies on smoking was the most commonly studied
(n = 12 studies). We found that smoking was associated with: a significant reduction in mean
birth weight for all five studies with data on this endpoint (Fig 4A); significantly greater relative

 reduction in birth weight for the single study with this endpoint (Fig 5A); and significantly
greater odds of low birth weight for five of seven studies for this endpoint (Fig 4C).
The relationship to birthweight for the remaining 11 chemicals/pollutants was available in 5
studies and included air pollution related exposures, benzene and alcohol. We observed signif-
icant relationships for PM2.5, PM10, PMcourse and NO2. We did not observe significant rela-
tionships with benzene, alcohol, cumulative traffic density, sulfur dioxide (Figs 4 & 5).
Main effects of psychosocial stress exposure (low chemical).
We assessed the effects of
nine broad stress exposures on mean birth weight and odds of low birth weight in humans
(Table 3). We found that these stressors were associated with negative effects on birth weight,

 but it was not consistent (Fig 4). One study on each of race [26] and SES [46] were associated
with significant reductions in mean birth weight (Fig 4A); and one study on each of social
class [34] and low maternal mood were associated with significantly greater odds of LBW
(Fig 4C). Two studies evaluating stress and birth weight stratified both by smoking status and
alcohol status in the same sample of women but with different measures of stress; in the first
study, low maternal mood was associated with significantly greater odds of LBW in both non-
smokers and non-drinkers [36]; conversely in the second study [32], low SES was associated
with a significant effect on odds of LBW in non-drinkers but not non-smokers (Fig 4C).
Combined effect of chemical and stress exposures.
Smoking in the presence of high-
stress was associated with a significant reduction in mean birth weight for all five different stress
comparisons (Fig 4A), a significantly greater odds of LBW for all five comparisons (Fig 4C).
Of the other 11 chemicals and hazards (which were mostly air pollution related exposures),
we in general found that with the exception of traffic proximity exposures (distance to major
highways, cumulative traffic density and residential proximity to highway), there was a signifi-
cant decrease in BW or increasing the odds of LBW in the presence of high-stress compared to
the control group (low stress/low chemical) (Fig 5A and 5B).
Interaction.
We found that the combined exposure group resulted in a significant wors-
ening in outcome compared to either exposure alone in 6 of 13 comparisons (Figs 4A and 5A,
Table 5).
We found a statistically significant interaction between smoking and high financial diffi-
culty on mean birth weight (Fig 4B) and lower social class on odds of LBW (Fig 4D). For data
on relative reduction in birth weight, smoking among those with lower educational attainment
resulted in a significant interaction on the original scale. The remaining interaction terms on
smoking and stress were either elevated but not significant, were null, or were in the opposite
direction (n = 4 for mean birth weight (Fig 4B) and n = 3 for odds of LBW; Fig 4D).
Table 5. A summary of the effects of combined exposure to high stress and high chemical in comparison to either one alone in 10 human studies.
To conclude that combined exposure is significantly associated with lower fetal growth than either exposure alone (high stress, low chemical & low stress,
high chemical) we required a significant difference (denoted by “+”) between combined exposure and both individual exposures. Non-significant differences
are denoted by “-“. Superscripts represent samples of the same population stratified by two chemical exposures.

 For the remaining stress and chemical exposures, their interaction was less clear; a similar
number of air pollutants in the presence and absence of stress (either race or neighborhood
poverty) had a significant and non-significant interaction on the original scale; we found an
interaction between benzene with high occupational stress and reduced birth weight [81]
(Fig 4B). We found that the interactions between alcohol and low maternal mood [36] or low
SES [32] were essentially null or negative, but with confidence intervals that crossed one
(Fig 4D). Interaction results for traffic proximity variables combined with stress were essen-
tially null (Fig 5B).
Meta-analysis: Smoking and low SES on odds of LBW. We identified four comparisons
suitable for meta-analysis from 4 unique studies involving 31,003 human participants on the
effects of smoking and stress based on SES or similar proxies for SES (years of paternal educa-
tion and social class). Smoking was associated with significantly increased odds of LBW in the
high stress (low SES) group (combined exposure, OR 4.75 (2.46–9.16); Χ2 = 33.28, I2 = 91.0%)
compared to the low stress group (high SES) (OR 1.95 (95% CI 1.53–2.48); Χ2 = 1.49, I2 = 0%).
There was also an elevated but not statistically significant odds ratio of LBW for high stress
(low SES) compared to low stress among non-smokers (OR 1.34 (0.82–2.20); Χ2 = 16.24,
I2 = 81.5%). The pooled interaction term from the meta-analysis was positive but not signifi-
cant (1.87 (0.78–4.48); Χ2 = 14.25, I2 = 79.0%; Fig 6). Due to the small number of included
studies we did not formally assess for publication bias.
Summary of findings from mammalian studies
In the following sections we describe the data on pre- or post-natal offspring weight from 22
studies with quantitative data amenable to analysis. Six studies reported only behavioral out-
comes [61, 63, 64, 75, 79, 98]; three meeting abstracts did not report quantitative data [60, 71,
96]; three studies reported only qualitative information on fetal growth [62, 69, 76] and one
study did not report the sample size [59]. The studies with quantitative data that we analyzed
had a median average sample size per group of 10 litters across the four exposure groups (IQR
9 to 12). The effect sizes for the combined and individual exposures to chemicals and stress
and their interaction are presented in the S1–S6 Figs. Note that the majority of studies reported
more than one comparison from the same cohort of animals, representing multiple time
points of assessment.
Main effects of chemical exposure.
We assessed ten chemicals quantitatively (alcohol
(n = 5 studies), aluminum (n = 3), caffeine (n = 1), diesel exhaust particulates (n = 1), lead
(n = 2), methylmercury chloride (n = 1), PFOS (n = 3), sodium arsenate (n = 1), toluene
(n = 3) and uranium (n = 2)). We found a negative association between prenatal aluminum
exposure and BW at all but the earliest time points of assessment (postnatal day 1 in rats (1
study, 16 comparisons; Fig 7A) and gestational day 15 in mice (2 studies, 10 comparisons);
Fig 7B). Additionally we found a trend towards weight reduction by alcohol in both rats (n = 2
studies, 3 comparisons) and mice (n = 3 studies, 8 comparisons (S1 Fig)). For all other chemi-
cals, the effects were unclear and the vast majority of comparisons had wide confidence inter-
vals that crossed the line of no effect (S2 to S6 Figs).
Main effects of stress exposure.
We assessed six methods of exposing animals to stress
(restraint (n = 18) heat (n = 1), nest material restriction (n = 1), no light (n = 1), restraint with
bright light (n = 1), and various stressors (n = 2)) (Table 4). Although the vast majority of stud-
ies used restraint stress, there was little consistency in findings, albeit with a slight trend
towards a reduction in weight, and the majority had confidence intervals which crossed the
line of no effect. For all studies the time of administration began during pregnancy but the
time of assessment of weight varied widely (from 3 days prior to birth until day 90 in mice;

 and from 1 day prior to birth until day 23 in rats), and most studies reported weight at multiple
time points. We pooled restraint-stress data from these different times of assessment for mice
and rats in a meta-analysis and found nine of ten summary estimates were negative (inferring
a reduction in growth due to restraint stress); however for all but one comparison, the confi-
dence intervals crossed the line of no effect (S1–S6 Figs).
Combined effect of chemical and stress exposures.
Of the ten chemicals we evaluated
quantitatively, there was a significant reduction in fetal growth outcomes when we evaluated
prenatal aluminum exposure and prenatal restraint stress in mice combined at all times of
assessment and rats at all but the earliest times points and one comparison measured at post-
natal day 21 (Fig 7). Additionally we found a trend towards a reduction in weight when tolu-
ene (assessed in two studies with ten comparisons) was paired with restraint or a variety of
stressors (data not shown). For all other chemical and stress exposures there was no clear
trend.
Interaction.
In 98 comparisons from four studies, we found five comparisons where the
combined exposure to stress and chemicals was associated with significantly lower weight than
either exposure alone; these were for toluene and various stressors, aluminum and restraint (3
comparisons, 2 studies) and sodium arsenite and restraint. For chemicals including alcohol,
PFOS, lead and uranium we found no evidence of a negative combined exposure. We found a
trend towards positive interactions for toluene paired with restraint or various stressors in
rats; however, all but one comparison had wide confidence intervals which crossed the line of
no effect. Interestingly we found a trend towards negative interactions (albeit most compari-
sons were not significant) for both alcohol paired with restraint, heat or light in mice and ura-
nium paired with restraint in rats. For all other chemicals and stressors, there was no
consistent trend.
Discussion
In this first systematic review on the combined impact of prenatal exposure to environmental
chemicals and psychosocial stress on fetal and developmental outcomes, we found only a small
body of evidence on this topic with substantial variation between studies in terms of the indi-
vidual and combined exposures investigated. However, in general we found human evidence
of an association between chemical exposure and reduced birth weight, and some evidence for
an association between increased stress and reduced birth weight. We found evidence for a
combined effect of chemical exposure and stress on birth weight, as this was statistically signif-
icant in our meta-analysis of smoking and stress. The interaction term was positive, but not
statistically significant.
There has been increasing attention to the interaction between environmental chemical
exposures and chronic psychosocial stress as having a cumulative effect on health outcomes,
and on whether this potential interaction may, in part, explain observed health disparities [22].
However, our systematic review, at least for developmental exposures, finds that the literature
is sparse. We identified nearly 14,000 potential studies in our search, but very few of these cov-
ered the topic of combined evaluation of environmental chemical exposures and stress. A fur-
ther limitation is that multiple exposures and outcomes were measured; further limiting the
evidence on any one topic. For example, for most outcomes we found 5 or fewer studies, with
the exception of birth weight and viability. Our search is unlikely to be biased or incomplete,
as we did a double screen on ten percent of the literature search results and found no discrep-
ancies in the findings.
Below, we summarize the findings for human and nonhuman evidence and highlight the
strengths and weaknesses of our approach and the available evidence.

 The impact of individual or combined exposures in humans
Across human studies we found consistent evidence of an association between higher chemical
exposure and reduced birth weight. This trend was less consistent for stress exposures and
reduced birth weight and in our analyses several comparisons were not significant. However,
when exposed to both high levels of stress and chemicals, we found that birth weight was con-
sistently reduced compared to the control group.
A further factor that could decrease our ability to observe relationships is that we dichoto-
mized each exposure into “high” and “low” in order to report the findings from each study on
the same scale; however this approach may have diluted some effects. For example we consid-
ered any tobacco exposure, whether it be passive smoking or heavy smoking under the cate-
gory of “high” exposure. For each variable the co-authors discussed the most conservative cut-
offs a priori. We attempted to perform a sensitivity analysis on the smoking data by looking at
the effects of the highest reported category of exposure versus the lowest; however only two of
eleven studies reported multiple exposure levels; the remaining nine studies dichotomized into
two exposure groups which we used for our analyses.
Finally, stress exposures are difficult to measure and were measured variably across the
human studies; stress exposure can be broadly grouped into place-based stress (clusters of high
stress conditions such as neighborhoods of greater poverty) and individual-based (e.g. dis-
crimination and number of life events). Some of these exposures are direct and others are indi-
rect; however in the present study we considered all exposures equally, including exposures
which can be classified as indicators of stress response (e.g. maternal mood) and stressors (e.g.
SES). Additionally, we found little methodological consistency across studies in their measure-
ment of chronic psychosocial stress.
Smoking and socioeconomic status
Given the limited evidence, our meta-analysis only included a subset of the data and only on
one type of chemical exposure (smoking in four studies) which we considered sufficiently
homogeneous for a meta-analysis; however the meta-analysis is likely to be underpowered due
to the small number of included studies. Nevertheless, our meta-analysis results on the effect
of smoking and low SES, found a clear trend towards a reduction in birth weight for smoking
in both the absence and presence of low SES. Our data on the effects of smoking confirm find-
ings from earlier studies, including a meta-analysis of environmental tobacco exposure which
identified significantly higher odds of LBW in the exposed group [101]. Moreover, the effect
was stronger in the presence of low SES. In contrast, low SES (a surrogate for higher stress
exposure) in the absence of smoking had no effect on birth weight and the interaction term
was elevated but not significant. Interestingly, a previous study on the effects of socially
ascribed status (in this case gender, race and ethnicity) in combination with smoking showed
an additive effect on mortality, whereas achieved status (including educational attainment,
labor force participation, and occupation) had an interaction with smoking on morbidity
[102].
Evidence from non-human mammalian studies
In general the findings from animal studies were not consistent; however, the dataset was
extremely heterogeneous and sparse. Of the nine chemical exposures, only aluminum had a
consistent effect, with weight reductions at all but the earliest time points in mice and rats;
however, these data were from 3 studies (2 on mice and 1 on rats) with multiple time points of
assessment and so we were unable to pool the data in a meta-analysis. We also found evidence
of weight reduction by alcohol in rats; however, these data were comprised of three

 comparisons from just two studies, and the effects in mice were inconsistent. We also found
that uranium was linked to a reduction in weight with later times of assessment; however, the
majority of comparisons (16 of 18) were from two cohorts of animals from a single study.
Although a more consistent measure of stress exposure was used across studies, with the
majority applying restraint stress, we generally did not find a trend in the relationship between
stress and fetal growth. However, pooling the data in a meta-analysis at different time points,
we found that restraint stress was modestly associated with reduced weight, but the data were
only significant at one range of time points (postnatal days 6 to 9).
When animals were exposed to both the chemical and stress, we found a trend towards a
relationship between aluminum, restraint stress and reduction in weight for mice at all times
points; for rats we observed effects at all but the earliest time points, for toluene and restraint
or various stressors, and uranium and restraint.
Interestingly, we did not find clear interactions for any of the pairs of exposures although
there was a trend towards positive interactions for alcohol in mice. We also found a trend
towards negative interactions for toluene paired with restraint or various stressors and ura-
nium paired with restraint stress, indicating that there was not greater weight loss in the com-
bined exposure group compared to the chemical and stress groups.
Finally, for four of the chemicals (caffeine, diesel exhaust particulate, methylmercury chlo-
ride and sodium arsenate), the number of comparisons were too small to draw meaningful
conclusions.
Limitations
There are a number of potential limitations to our systematic review. First, despite our attempt
to conduct a robust and comprehensive literature search, we cannot be certain that we identi-
fied every relevant study. However, we performed a snowball search to try to reduce this risk.
In addition, due to the heterogeneity between both human and animal studies, we were unable
to formally assess for potential publication bias. Second, the limited number of studies, and the
breadth of the research question meant we were only able to perform a meta-analysis on one
combination of stress and chemical exposure which was in itself only based on four studies.
Third, although we set out to follow the Navigation Guide methodology, we did not perform
the fourth step—rating the body of evidence to make a final recommendation on the associa-
tion between the exposures and outcome. This is because our primary objective was to assess
the scope of the literature and in performing a review of such a broad topic, any combination
of chemical and stress exposure, we did not believe this step to be feasible. Making a formal
recommendation on the body and strength of evidence is better suited to a single exposure
with inherently less heterogeneity in measurement approaches. Finally, we attempted to quali-
tatively assess the quality of the relevant studies using the risk of bias tool outlined in the Navi-
gation Guide.
Recommendations
There has been increasing attention to the interaction between environmental chemical expo-
sure and chronic psychosocial stress as having a cumulative effect on health outcomes, and on
whether this potential interaction may, in part, explain observed health disparities [103]. How-
ever, our systematic review, at least for developmental exposures, indicates that the literature is
sparse and too inconsistent to make firm conclusions about the presence of interactions. There
are several key areas of research needed to advance our understanding of interactions between
chemical exposure and chronic psychosocial stress: 1) develop and apply more consistent mea-
sures that reflect the different dimensions of chronic psychosocial stress in human
Combined effects of chemicals and stress on fetal growth

 epidemiologic studies; 2) evaluate the methods used for inducing chronic psychosocial stress
in animal studies to ensure they are reflective of stress in humans; and 3) expand the evaluation
of combined chemical exposures. These recommendations are based on the following limita-
tions we faced in our systematic review. First, there are a diverse array of stress exposures of
relevance to fetal growth and developmental outcomes, which pose significant challenges to
utilizing consistent measure of stress across studies; moreover, there are key differences across
studies in terms of whether stress is measured at the individual- or community-level. For
example, the stress of living in a high poverty neighborhood compared to a low poverty neigh-
borhood may not exert the same adverse effect as individual-level measures of high versus low
socioeconomic status or material deprivation. Although it is challenging to apply uniform
approaches to measuring stress exposure due to its diverse dimensions, efforts to harmonize
more commonly used measures, such as those related to individual-level poverty or neighbor-
hood level socioeconomic status, could better facilitate future systematic reviews to assess the
combined effects of stress and chemical exposure. Our capacity to systematically assess com-
bined effects in human studies is further complicated by the lack of consistent chemical expo-
sures among studies that evaluate combined effects with chronic psychosocial stress. Second,
while the animal studies had a more consistent approach to measuring stress (restraint stress),
the literature indicates that this may not sufficiently reflect chronic psychosocial stress in
humans [104]. Further, there was an insufficient number of studies to evaluate the combined
effects of chemicals and restraint among animals during development.
Conclusions
To our knowledge this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of cumula-
tive prenatal exposure to stress and environmental chemicals on developmental outcomes.
Overall we found this to be an understudied topic and recommend further investigation in
high quality, pragmatically designed animal or human observational studies. However, within
the context of the small body of evidence currently available, we found that exposure to several
chemicals in the absence of stress is associated with a reduction in fetal growth in humans, and
this effect is generally larger in the presence of stress. Conversely, we found little effect of stress
in the absence of chemical exposure. Our assessment of the animal data were limited by the
small number of studies on each chemical and stressor and by limitations to their quality, par-
ticularly the lack of allocation concealment, sequence generation and blinding. Overall, we
found that prenatal exposure for several chemicals is harmful, but there is limited evidence of
interaction with stress exposure, and combined exposure was associated with significantly
reduced fetal weight in comparison to either exposure alone in about half of studies.
