STUDY QUESTION: What is the semen quality of young adult men who were conceived 18–22 years ago by ICSI for male infertility?
SUMMARY ANSWER: In this cohort of 54 young adult ICSI men, median sperm concentration, total sperm count and total motile sperm
count were significantly lower than in spontaneously conceived peers.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The oldest ICSI offspring cohort worldwide has recently reached adulthood. Hence, their reproductive
health can now be investigated. Since these children were conceived by ICSI because of severe male-factor infertility, there is reasonable con-
cern that male offspring have inherited the deficient spermatogenesis from their fathers. Previously normal pubertal development and
adequate Sertoli and Leydig cell function have been described in pubertal ICSI boys; however, no information on their sperm quality is cur-
rently available.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This study was conducted at UZ Brussel between March 2013 and April 2016 and is part of a large
follow-up project focussing on reproductive and metabolic health of young adults, between 18 and 22 years and conceived after ICSI with eja-
culated sperm. Results of both a physical examination and semen analysis were compared between young ICSI men being part of a longitudin-
ally followed cohort and spontaneously conceived controls who were recruited cross-sectionally.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHOD: Results of a single semen sample in 54 young adult ICSI men and 57 spontan-
eously conceived men are reported. All young adults were individually assessed, and the results of their physical examination were completed
by questionnaires. Data were analysed by multiple linear and logistic regression, adjusted for covariates. In addition, semen parameters of the
ICSI fathers dating back from their ICSI treatment application were analysed for correlations.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Young ICSI adults had a lower median sperm concentration (17.7 million/ml), lower
median total sperm count (31.9 million) and lower median total motile sperm count (12.7 million) in comparison to spontaneously conceived
peers (37.0 million/ml; 86.8 million; 38.6 million, respectively). The median percentage progressive and total motility, median percentage nor-
mal morphology and median semen volume were not significantly different between these groups. After adjustment for confounders (age,
BMI, genital malformations, time from ejaculation to analysis, abstinence period), the statistically significant differences between ICSI men and
spontaneously conceived peers remained: an almost doubled sperm concentration in spontaneously conceived peers in comparison to ICSI
men (ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.2) and a two-fold lower total sperm count (ratio 2.3, 95% CI 1.3–4.1) and total motile count (ratio 2.1, 95% CI
1.2–3.6) in ICSI men compared to controls were found. Furthermore, compared to men born after spontaneous conception, ICSI men were
nearly three times more likely to have sperm concentrations below the WHO reference value of 15 million/ml (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)
2.7; 95% CI 1.1–6.7) and four times more likely to have total sperm counts below 39 million (AOR 4.3; 95% CI 1.7–11.3). In this small group
of 54 father–son pairs, a weak negative correlation between total sperm count in fathers and their sons was found.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The main limitation is the small study population. Also, the results of this study where ICSI
was performed with ejaculated sperm and for male-factor infertility cannot be generalized to all ICSI offspring because the indications for ICSI
have nowadays been extended and ICSI is also being performed with non-ejaculated sperm and reported differences may thus either
decrease or increase.

ity in young adults born after ICSI for male infertility in their fathers.

Introduction
In 1991, the introduction of ICSI into clinical practice was a real break-
through for the treatment of male-factor infertility; men with impaired
spermatogenesis could become the genetic father of their offspring
which was not possible before (Van Steirteghem et al., 1993).
Nowadays, ICSI is a routinely performed ART, which has resulted in
>2.5 million babies born worldwide (Van Steirteghem, 2012). Although
ICSI was initially performed in couples with male-factor infertility, ICSI is
now increasingly used even in the absence of abnormal semen para-
meters, which hinders conclusions on its role in male infertility per se.
Until now, the health of children conceived by IVF and ICSI has been
described from infancy up to pubertal age but never beyond. Indeed,
ART including ICSI has repeatedly been associated with an increased
risk of adverse health outcomes in the perinatal period, including
increased risk of low birth weight, prematurity and birth defects
(Pinborg et al, 2013a, b). Although adverse cardiometabolic and vascu-
lar outcomes have been described in both IVF offspring (Ceelen et al.,
2007, 2008; Sakka et al., 2010; Scherrer et al., 2012; Valenzuela-
Alcaraz et al., 2013) and ICSI offspring (Belva et al., 2007, 2011b), the
impact of ART on the reproductive health of the offspring remains
unknown. We previously described normal pubertal development
(Belva et al., 2012), normal levels of inhibin B, i.e. a marker of Sertoli cell
function (Belva et al., 2010) and normal levels of salivary testosterone, a
marker of Leydig cell function in pubertal ICSI boys, as compared to
spontaneously conceived peers (Belva et al., 2011a). In a small group,
both inhibin B and salivary testosterone levels were comparable in boys
from fathers with severe oligoozoospermia to those in boys from fathers
without severe oligozoospermia (Belva et al., 2011a). But whether ICSI-
conceived men born to fathers with impaired spermatogenesis are at
risk of inheriting deficient spermatogenesis from their fathers could not
be answered due to their young age.
Literature data regarding reproductive health of IVF and ICSI off-
spring is limited; only one study has described sperm parameters of
young men whose mothers received ‘fertility treatment’ (Jensen et al.,
2007) and reported in a cohort of 47 men, a 46% lower sperm con-
centration and fewer motile and morphologically normal spermatozoa.
Unfortunately, no information regarding the exact treatment mode
was available. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether this finding is
transferable to offspring who are conceived by ICSI mainly because of
male-factor infertility.
Primary testicular dysfunction is the most frequent cause of male
infertility, and although often unexplained, a genetic origin can be
diagnosed in a subgroup (Massart et al., 2012). Infertile men are
known to have a higher prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities
than fertile men (Ferlin et al., 2007), and the transmission may result
in affected offspring. Y-chromosomal microdeletions, particularly in
the AZFc (azoospermia factor c) region, are the most frequently
diagnosed genetic cause of impaired spermatogenesis with a preva-
lence of 6% in severely oligozoospermic men to 10% in azoospermic
men (Oliva et al., 1998; Vogt, 1998; Maurer and Simoni, 2000;
Stouffs et al., 2008). Transmission of Y-chromosomal deletions from
father to son through ICSI has been reported (Kent-First et al., 1996;
Kamischke et al., 1999; Page et al., 1999). In view of the potential
transgenerational transmission of male infertility, it remains to be elu-
cidated whether the severity of the paternal spermatogenic failure
(e.g. severe oligozoospermia) heralds impaired spermatogenesis in
the offspring.
In this study, we compared semen parameters in the world oldest
ICSI cohort, conceived by ICSI for mainly (severe) male-factor infertil-
ity, with spontaneously conceived peers. Furthermore, in order to
investigate whether poor sperm quality in the fathers may be predict-
ive for the sperm quality of their sons, we correlated the semen para-
meters of ICSI men with those of their fathers at the start of their ICSI
treatment almost 20 years ago.
Materials and methods
Set-up and study groups
This study is part of a larger project investigating the cardiometabolic and
reproductive profile of young ICSI adults, both female and male.
Therefore, several examinations including physical examination, biometry,
semen analysis and blood sampling were performed. Participants were
offered the chance to deliver a second semen sample or blood sample in
case of an abnormal result. In addition, participants were offered genetic
testing (Yq deletions) in case of sperm concentrations <5 million/ml.
Participants received written feedback regarding the results of their tests
and were offered appropriate counselling, investigation and follow-up. All
participants received an incentive by means of a gift voucher.
Young adults were eligible for inclusion if they were singleton, Caucasian
and aged between 18 and 22 years in the study period between March
2013 and April 2016.

 These adults, born between 1992 and 1996 after transfer of fresh
embryos formed through ICSI using autologous, freshly ejaculated sperm,
are part of a prospective follow-up cohort since their birth. The majority
have been assessed earlier at one or more time points, i.e. 2 months, 1
year, 2 years, 5 years, 8 years and 14 years. All parents of eligible young
ICSI adults in our database (n = 423) were sent a letter explaining the back-
ground and set-up of the study. Shortly after, these parents were contacted
by phone in order to explore their own and their children’s willingness to
participate. After consent of the parents, the young adults were approached
and invited to participate. The young adults were not approached directly,
since from our study conducted at age 14 years, we learned that 20% of the
parents did not disclose the mode of assisted conception to their children.
From the 215 eligible ICSI families with a male offspring, 149 could be
reached. Eventually, 56 (37.5%) young ICSI men participated, but two
were excluded since they were not able to produce a semen sample. Of
the 93 refusing, 45 men declined participation themselves, while in 21
cases the parents decided that ‘the family’ was not interested in participat-
ing and thus their sons were not contacted. For 9 men, the mode of con-
ception was not disclosed, and in 18 cases there was no objection to the
study but an appointment for testing was cancelled and/or a suitable time
for testing could not be arranged due to work or school. The reasons
for declining for the 45 young adults were: ‘I do not want to participate’
(n = 31), ‘I do not have the time to participate’ (n=10), ‘I do not want one/
all examination(s) to be performed’ (n=3), ‘I am afraid to know my fertility
potential’ (n=1). Taking into account that the invitation to participate in this
study reached only 119 young adults instead of 149, the actual participation
rate is 47%. The educational level is known for 52 participants: 43 (83%)
were attending university or non-university higher education.
A control group of spontaneously conceived peers aged between 18
and 22 years was recruited at college and university campuses. In order to
balance groups, ICSI men were asked to invite a friend to serve as a partici-
pant in the control group. Recruitment was also performed by oral and
written campaigns, resulting in 57 volunteers who were willing to partici-
pate, of whom 56 attended university or non-university higher education.
Men who were only willing to take part in sub-examinations (physical
examination and/or blood sampling) were not included in the study. Only
young adults born after spontaneous conception without the use of any
hormonal stimulation were eligible as controls.
Informed consent and Ethics Committee
Only participants who filled out the written informed consent after being
informed were enroled. A separate informed consent was obtained for
genetic testing. This study is part of a larger project on reproductive and
metabolic health in young adults conceived by ICSI, which was approved
by the Ethics Committee of the UZ Brussel.
Measurements
Physical examination
Weight and height were measured using standard equipment. BMI was calcu-
lated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres( kg/m2).
Physical examinations were performed by urologists who were blinded
to the mode of conception and to the participant’s semen quality.
Testicular volumes were assessed by a Prader orchidometer and by ultra-
sound (Behre et al., 1989). Each testis was measured by estimating its max-
imal dimensions in three planes (width, length and height). The formula
(length x width x height x 0.52) has been used to calculate the testicular
volume based on ultrasound measurements (Lenz et al., 1993; Bahk et al.,
2010). For analysis, the mean of the right and left testicular volume (based
on the latter formula) was used. Genital examination (presence of varico-
cele, hydrocele, spermatocele, location of the testis in the scrotum, any
other malformation) as well as penile length was measured.
Questionnaires
All participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire covering a large series
of health parameters about themselves and their family, including informa-
tion on lifestyle factors (sports, smoking habits, alcohol consumption and
recreational drugs), chronic medication intake (at least 1 year), chronic ill-
nesses (suffering at least 1 year), surgical interventions, any genital disorder
(cryptorchidism, hydrocele, varicocele, inguinal hernia, other) and its treat-
ment. In addition, educational level was asked as well as early life factors
including in utero exposure to tobacco during pregnancy.
Before collection of the semen sample, staff members of the andrology
laboratory recorded information on the abstinence time, the use of medi-
cation in the last 3 months and the occurrence of fever of >38 °C for at
least 24 h in the past 3 months.
In case of missing or incomplete information, participants were re-
contacted for further information.
Semen analysis
A semen sample was obtained by masturbation at the hospital. The partici-
pants had been instructed to abstain from ejaculation for at least 3 days
prior to delivery of the sample. Semen analyses were performed blind to
the mode of conception. The sample was analysed according to the most
recent edition of the WHO manual for the examination and processing of
human sperm (WHO, 2010). Ejaculate volume was measured by weight of
the sample in a pre-weighed container. Sperm concentration was assessed
by the use of the improved Neubauer haemocytometer, after dilution with
a formalin solution. Total sperm count (semen volume x semen concentra-
tion) was reported. Sperm morphology was assessed after Shorr staining
and according to strict criteria (Menkveld et al., 1990; WHO, 2010). For
sperm motility assessment, the percentage of progressive motility (A + B)
and total motility (A + B + C) were calculated. Total motile count (semen
volume x semen concentration x progressive motility/100) was also pro-
vided. For definitions of normal semen quality, the WHO reference values
for human semen characteristics are adopted (Cooper et al., 2010; WHO,
2010). The laboratory participates in an external quality control pro-
gramme for semen assessment.
In the early 1990s, semen analysis of the fathers was performed accord-
ing to the third edition of the WHO manual for human semen examination
(WHO, 1992). Volume was assessed using graduated pipettes, and con-
centration and motility were evaluated in the Makler or improved
Neubauer counting chamber. Regarding morphology, less strict criteria
were applied in the early nineties.
In case of aberrant semen analysis results of the young adults, the deliv-
ery of a second semen sample was encouraged. However, only one ICSI
male delivered a second semen sample, with results in line with those from
the first sample. None of the spontaneously conceived men were willing to
deliver a second semen sample.
Genetic analysis
In participants with a sperm concentration <5 million/ml, who gave their
additional consent for genetic testing, Y chromosome microdeletion screen-
ing was performed in two multiplex PCR reactions, according to the recom-
mendations described by Simoni et al. (2004) and Krausz et al. (2014). Six
out of eight ICSI participants and one out of four of the controls in this situ-
ation gave their consent for genetic testing prior to the semen sampling.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated on all parameters to determine the
characteristics of the sample. In addition to mean and SD, also median and
interquartile range (IQR) presenting the 25th–75th percentiles are reported,
given the non-normal or near-normal distribution of several parameters.

 were logarithmically transformed (log10) to normalize their distribution. For
ease of interpretability, mean values and 95% CIs were back-transformed
for reporting. Volume, progressive motility and total motility were distribu-
ted close to normal and were analysed without transformation. Also, the
distribution of testicular volume was close to normal and therefore not
transformed for analysis. Chi-square test was used for categorical variables
and Student’s t-test (normalized) was used for continuous variables.
Between-group differences (expressed as median) in sperm parameters
were also tested with the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test. Data ana-
lysis was performed using SPSS software version 23.
Multiple linear regression analysis was used to investigate differences in
sperm parameters (concentration, total sperm count, total motile sperm
count, morphology, progressive motility, total motility and volume) and
multiple logistic regression was used to determine whether ICSI concep-
tion was associated with reduced semen quality: having a sperm concen-
tration <15 million/ml, having a sperm concentration <5 million/ml,
having a total sperm count <39 million, having <32% progressively motile
sperm or having <4% morphologically normal sperm. Reference limits are
adopted from the latest WHO guidelines (Cooper et al., 2010).
Preliminary univariate regression analysis was performed in order to
select covariates, known to affect sperm parameters and/or to be differently
present among the two study groups, for inclusion in the final linear and
logistic regression models. The following covariates were tested: age (con-
tinuous), time from ejaculation to analysis (continuous), abstinence period
(≤2 days, 2–5 days, >5 days), genital malformation (yes/no according to
combined information from questionnaire and physical examination), season
of sampling (spring/summer versus fall/winter), BMI (<25, ≥25), smoking
(yes/no), drugs (yes/no) and alcohol consumption (yes/no).
For the linear regression models, the covariates age, time from ejacula-
tion to analysis, abstinence period and genital malformations were asso-
ciated with at least one of the sperm parameters (see below). For the
logistic regression models, the covariates age, abstinence period, genital
malformation and BMI were associated with at least one of the outcomes
(data not shown). For reasons of uniformity, the same covariates were
used in the linear as well as in the logistic regression models. Therefore,
the following covariates were used in all models: age, BMI, genital malfor-
mation, time from ejaculation to analysis and abstinence period.
Results are expressed as unstandardized regression coefficients (B) with
a 95% CI. For log transformed outcome variables (concentration, total
sperm count, total motile count and morphology), regression coefficients
and 95% CIs were back-transformed and should be interpreted as a ratio.
The association between mean testicular volume and semen parameters
in the ICSI men and controls was analysed with linear regression.
All semen parameters of the ICSI fathers, except volume, were logarith-
mically transformed (log10) before correlation analysis. Volume was left
untransformed.
The sample size was estimated from a power calculation was for the
outcome total sperm count. With an aim of 55 participants in each group
and an assumed overall mean (SD) total sperm count of 154 million (120)
(Mendiola et al., 2013), a reduction in total sperm count of ~30% could be
detected with a power of 80% and a significance level alpha of 5% (one-
sided test of log transformed total sperm count).
Results
Clinical characteristics
Characteristics of the participants are shown in Table I. ICSI men were
slightly younger than their spontaneously conceived peers (P = 0.003).
BMI was comparable between the two groups (P = 0.17). Self-
reported alcohol consumption was different between the two groups,
with more ICSI young adults reporting ever drinking alcohol (P =
0.07). The rate of genital malformations was comparable between the
study groups (P = 0.52).
In both groups, three men had fever in the 2 months preceding the
collection of the semen sample (P = 0.95) and 17 (31.5%) ICSI men
and 15 (26.3%) controls had been taken medication (P = 0.55).
Chronic medication use was recorded for 9 (16.7%) ICSI participants:
5 for allergies/asthma, 1 for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, 3
for acne using oral retinoids and for 13 men in the control group
(22.8%): for allergies/asthma, for seizures, for depression and for
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (P = 0.512).
There was no difference in mean testicular volume and glans type
between the ICSI men and spontaneously conceived controls
(Table I).
Regarding the ICSI men, ICSI was performed in 92.5% (50/54) of
the cases because of male-factor infertility (48/54 only male infertility,
2/54 combined male and female infertility). Four couples suffered
from idiopathic infertility.
Results of univariate linear regression
analysis
Season of sampling, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption and drug use
were not associated with any of the semen parameters in our study.
Age was associated with total motile count (P = 0.04) and progressive
motility (P = 0.04). Long abstinence time was negatively correlated with
progressive motility (P = 0.028) and total motility (P = 0.009); short
abstinence time was associated with volume (P = 0.020).
Although genital malformation was not associated with sperm con-
centration and total sperm count in the univariate analysis, the findings
after stratification are noteworthy: in men having a genital malforma-
tion, a trend towards a four times lower sperm concentration (back-
transformed mean: 7.3 versus 28.8 million/ml; P = 0.08) and total
sperm count (back-transformed mean: 12.6 versus 50.1 million; P =
0.08) was observed in ICSI men versus controls. Even in the group of
men without genital malformations, ICSI men had lower sperm con-
centrations and lower total sperm counts compared to controls (back-
transformed mean: 16.5 versus 28.2 million/ml; P = 0.04 and back-
transformed mean: 32.4 versus 70.9 million; P = 0.01).
Neither sperm concentration nor total sperm count were asso-
ciated with mean testicular volume (P = 0.17; P = 0.08).
Comparison of semen parameters between
ICSI men and controls
Time from ejaculation to analysis was well within 1 h and was compar-
able between the two groups (P = 0.26) (Table II). Abstinence time
before sampling was mostly <2 days, both for ICSI as well as for con-
trol men. There was spilling during collection of the sample for three
ICSI and four control men (P = 0.75).
ICSI men had lower median sperm concentrations (17.7 million/
ml), lower median total sperm counts (31.9 million) and lower median
total motile sperm (12.7 million) count in comparison to spontan-
eously conceived peers (37.0 million/ml, P = 0.004; 86.8 million, P =
0.001; 38.6 million, P = 0.002, respectively). (Table II). Median per-
centage progressive and total motility, median percentage normal
morphology rate and median semen volume were not significantly dif-
ferent between the two groups (P = 0.19; 0.61; 0.29; 0.22,

 respectively). The type of defects (neck-midpiece, head and tail) was
comparable among the ICSI offspring and the controls.
After adjustment for confounders (age, BMI, genital malformation,
time from ejaculation to analysis, abstinence period), the statistically
significant differences between ICSI men and spontaneously con-
ceived peers remained: a doubled sperm concentration in spontan-
eously conceived peers in comparison to ICSI men (ratio: 1.9; 95%
CI 1.1–3.2; P = 0.02) as well as a two-fold lower total sperm count
(ratio: 2.3; 95% CI 1.3–4.1; P = 0.005) and total motile count (ratio:
2.1; 95% CI 1.2–3.6; P = 0.007) in ICSI men compared to controls
(Table III).
Adjustment for confounders did not change the results of morph-
ology, progressive motility, total motility and volume. For these para-
meters, differences between ICSI men and controls were not
statistically significant.
Risk of reduced semen quality in ICSI
offspring
Compared to men born after spontaneous conception, ICSI men
were nearly three times more likely to have sperm concentrations
<15 million/ml (AOR 2.7; 95% CI 1.1–6.7; P = 0.035) and four
times more likely to have total sperm counts <39 million (AOR 4.3;
95% CI 1.7–11.3; P = 0.002) (Table IV). Also, the risk of having
below-reference (<4% normal) sperm morphology rates was
non-significantly higher in ICSI men (AOR 2.3; 95% CI 0.9–5.4;
P = 0.06).
ICSI men were twice as likely to have extremely low-sperm concen-
tration (<5 million/ml) and below-reference (<32%) progressive
motile sperm, but this was not statistically significant (AOR 2.6; 95%
CI 0.6–10.7 and AOR 2.3; 95% CI 0.7–7.9, respectively).
Six out of eight ICSI men with sperm concentration <5 million/ml
were tested for Yq deletions but no abnormalities were found. From
the four controls with sperm concentration <5 million/ml, one male
was tested for Yq deletions and his result was normal.
Association of semen parameters of ICSI
offspring with semen parameters of their
fathers
More than 72% (39/54) of the fathers had sperm concentrations <15
million/ml, 26 out of 54 (48%) had sperm concentrations <5 million/ml
and 38 (70%) had a total sperm count <39 million. Sperm characteristics
of the ICSI fathers are provided in Table V.
Sperm concentration and total motile count in fathers were not cor-
related with corresponding values in their sons (r = −0.2; P = 0.09 and
r = −0.2; P = 0.07). Also, percentage progressive and total motility in
father–son pairs were not correlated (r = 0.2; P = 0.14 and r = 0.0;
P = 0.83). Paternal total sperm count was weakly negatively correlated
with total sperm count in the sons (r = −0.3; P = 0.02).

 ICSI men were not more likely to have sperm concentra-
tions <15 million/ml if their fathers had sperm concentration <15
million/ml (OR 0.4; 95% CI 0.1–1.2). Also, ICSI men were
not more likely to have sperm concentrations <15 million/ml if
their father had severe oligozoospermia (<5 million/ml) (OR 0.4;
95% CI 0.1–1.2). ICSI fathers with total sperm count <39 million
were more likely to have sons with total sperm count >39 million
(OR 0.1; 95% CI 0.0–0.4). Only 40% of the fathers with total
sperm count <39 million had sons with total sperm count <39
million.

 Discussion
This study investigated the reproductive health of the worldwide old-
est cohort of ICSI offspring, having reached the age of 18–22 years.
Compared to spontaneously conceived peers, young ICSI men
showed lower sperm concentration, lower total sperm count as well
as lower total motile sperm count. In terms of WHO (2010) reference
values, young adult ICSI offspring were almost three times more likely
to have sperm concentrations <15 million/ml and four times more
likely to have total sperm count <39 million. ICSI men also had a non-
statistically significant two-fold higher risk of having normal morph-
ology rates <4%. In our rather small sample of 54 ICSI men, fathers
with sperm concentrations <15 million/ml did not have offspring with
sperm concentrations <15 million/ml.
Our findings are robust even after adjusting for covariates that are
generally known to affect sperm parameters. In our data, no correl-
ation between BMI, season of sampling, smoking, alcohol consumption
and drug use could be found with any of the semen parameters. Also
in the literature, BMI (MacDonald et al., 2010), season of sampling
(Francavilla et al., 2007), alcohol consumption (Jensen et al., 2014),
drug (ab)use (Gundersen et al., 2015) are not univocally correlated
with semen parameters. Although smoking has been repeatedly nega-
tively associated with conventional semen parameters (Sharma et al.,
2016), the effect of smoking might not be detectable in our rather
young aged groups who only smoke occasionally. In our study, in con-
trast to a Japanese study (Sakamoto et al., 2008), testicular volume
was not correlated to semen parameters.
Comparing our outcomes to literature data is difficult since semen
parameters of ICSI offspring are not described yet. Although a 46%
lower sperm concentration and a 45% lower total sperm count were
found in a study of 47 young adults born after maternal ‘fertility treat-
ment’ in comparison with young adults born to mothers who did not
receive any fertility treatment (Jensen et al., 2007), our results in ICSI
offspring show even more pronounced lower sperm concentrations

Semen quality of ICSI offspring

 and lower total sperm counts in comparison to peers born without
any fertility treatment, which might be explained by the different back-
ground of the parents (female- versus male-factor infertility).
Why this eldest cohort of ICSI-conceived men have both low-sperm
quantity and quality is not clear? The unfavourable semen characteristics
of the ICSI fathers are not predictive of the birth of a son facing deficient
spermatogenesis, according to our rather small sample. However, this
finding does not exclude the transgenerational inheritance of impaired
spermatogenesis since the risk of low concentration and low total sperm
count in ICSI offspring was found to be three to four times higher com-
pared to a cross-sectionally recruited control group, even after ruling
out Yq deletions. Also, copy number variants (Krausz et al., 2012) and
polymorphisms in other genes than those from the Y chromosome
have been associated with male infertility (Aston et al., 2010, Sato et al.,
2015). Unfortunately, the genetic origins of male-factor infertility remain
largely unknown. Furthermore, epigenetic modifications, including aber-
rant DNA methylation in spermatozoa, have been associated with oligo-
zoospermia, abnormal sperm morphology and decreased progressive
motility (see supplementary table of Laurentino et al., 2016). However,
it remains to be elucidated if epimutations of spermatozoa can be trans-
mitted to the offspring (Reik et al., 2001). Further research should focus
on several approaches to assess men’s fertility potential: from exome
and whole genome sequencing and epigenetics to novel seminal biomar-
kers. Since the cellular and molecular functioning of a spermatozoon
remains poorly understood, which prevents insights into dysfunctional
sperm cells, proteomics might reveal abnormal protein profiles asso-
ciated with impaired spermatogenesis (Barratt, 2008). Importantly, given
the results of this study, paired analysis of samples from fathers and sons
is recommended. Alternatively, although birth weight as a proxy of foe-
tal growth was comparable between the groups, suboptimal foetal
growth patterns in ICSI offspring might be responsible for lower sperm
quality, as has recently been shown in an unbiased cohort of Australian
young men (Hart et al., 2016).
To unravel the effect of the procedure, i.e. ICSI, versus the back-
ground risk, i.e. male infertility, on the reported findings in ICSI off-
spring is precarious. Whether the more invasive ICSI procedure is
associated with adverse outcomes can be studied in male offspring
conceived by conventional IVF (without ICSI) applied in couples with
severe male-factor infertility, which is evidently very difficult. To link
the male infertility factor with the reported findings, we should have
included a cohort of male offspring conceived by ICSI for indications
other than male infertility. However, in the early 1990s when ICSI was
developed in our centre and patients were referred for treatment, the
main indication for ICSI was male infertility. Outcomes in future gen-
erations of ICSI offspring may elucidate this hypothesis.
Considering that semen delivery in young adults is a serious challenge,
our study had a rather high response rated since 37.5% (tested/reached)
or 47% (tested/actually reached) of the ICSI-conceived men were willing
to participate. The response rate in the control group could not be calcu-
lated since various ways of advertising were adopted. For both the ICSI
and the control populations, the deposit of a semen sample turned out
to be a major difficulty. Overall, acceptance rates of volunteers to pro-
vide a semen sample for research are between 13% and 19% and thus
evidently do not represent the general population (Cooper et al., 2010).
One might speculate that the recruited control group in this study is
more healthy than average given the apparently lower rates of tobacco
use, drug use, alcohol consumption and the higher number of hours of
sports per week, which may infer ‘better outcomes’ for semen para-
meters in the control group. When we compare the sperm concentra-
tion as observed in our control group with that described in the
literature, the median sperm concentration of 37 million/ml in our con-
trol group was not significantly different from that in other unbiased
cohorts: a cohort of 19-year-old Danish men who had a medical exam-
ination for military drafting (median 41 million/ml) (Andersen et al.,
2000) or the Western Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) consisting of 20- to
22-year-old men (median 45 million/ml) (Hart et al., 2015) (Wilcoxon
Signed Rank test: P = 0.73 and P = 0.23, respectively). Although popula-
tion differences may exist, the median sperm concentration of the con-
trols reported here are comparable to the literature data that confirm
that our control group is comparable to volunteers in other countries. In
addition, our group of spontaneously conceived men of the same age as
the study participants had no prior knowledge of their own fertility sta-
tus and thus this is unlikely to have influenced their motivation to partici-
pate. However, although participation bias in the ICSI group cannot be
ruled out, this type of bias is unlikely too. One may hypothesize that par-
ents who needed ICSI because of severely impaired semen quality
would ‘encourage’ their sons to participate in order to discover whether
their sons have compromised spermatogenesis too. Nearly one in three
of the parents who refused participation disallowed us to contact their
sons, either because of non-disclosure of the conception mode or
because of ‘the family is not interested’, the latter pointing to a secretive
attitude that is known to be more prominent in couples with male infer-
tility than in those with female infertility (Hjelmstedt et al., 1999). In any
case, since the great majority of the non-participating ICSI families (88%,
versus 89% in the participating families) had male-factor infertility as the
indication for ICSI, we do not assume that the results observed in the
group of participating ICSI men are biased towards a worse fertility sta-
tus than in the non-participant groups.
An advantage of this study is that every individual was examined in
one single centre. Indeed, data on weight and height but also informa-
tion on genital malformations are retrieved from a physical examin-
ation in our centre and are thus more accurate than self-reported data
as used in other outcome studies.
Strikingly, both in the ICSI and the control group, men with low-
quality semen samples were invited to deliver a second sample, which
occurred for only one ICSI men, and with comparable results in both
samples. Although a large within-subject variability in semen para-
meters has been reported (Keel, 2006; Francavilla et al., 2007), it has
also been shown that within-subject coefficients of variation are lower
in sperm donors compared with infertile men (Keel 2006). Other stud-
ies confirmed that in fertile men, a second semen analysis does not
systematically differ from a first one (Stokes-Riner et al., 2007; Zhu
et al., 2016). Nevertheless, our findings of semen parameters based on
one semen sample should be interpreted accordingly.
In conclusion, the worldwide oldest ICSI-conceived adults showed
significantly lower sperm concentration, lower total sperm count as
well as lower total motile sperm count in comparison to a control
group of spontaneously conceived peers. The risk of having sperm
concentration and total sperm counts below the reference values was
increased in ICSI offspring compared to controls. This finding should
be interpreted in view of the background of the parents: ICSI was per-
formed with ejaculated sperm because of impaired spermatogenesis.
A generalization to all offspring born after ICSI, including ICSI for other
indications than male infertility and ICSI in combination with non-

 ejaculated sperm, can therefore not be made. Although we did not
observe a clear correlation between the semen parameters of the ICSI
men and their fathers, further genetic and epigenetic investigation of
transgenerational passage of male infertility is highly mandatory.
