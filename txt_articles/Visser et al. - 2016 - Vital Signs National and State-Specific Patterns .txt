Introduction
Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a 
neurodevelopmental disorder with childhood onset character-
ized by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention, 
hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity and pervasive, significant 
functional impairment (1). As of 2011–2012, approximately 
6.4 million U.S. children aged 4–17 years (11%) were reported 
by parents to have a diagnosis of ADHD, a 42% increase since 
2003 (2). Nearly one third of children with ADHD (approxi-
mately 2 million) received the diagnosis before age 6 years (3). 
Among children described by their parents as having severe 
ADHD, half of the cases were diagnosed by age 4 years (2).
Children with ADHD have higher rates of retention in grade 
level, high school dropout, unintentional injuries, and emer-
gency department visits (4–6). Among one third of children 
with ADHD, the disorder persists into adulthood; among 
adults with ADHD, the prevalences of lesser educational and 
career attainment, co-occurring psychiatric disorders, and 
death by suicide are higher (7,8). U.S. societal costs of child-
hood ADHD are estimated at $38–$72 billion annually (9).
ADHD is first diagnosed by a primary care physician 
among 53% of diagnosed cases in children aged 4–17 years; 
psychiatrists, psychologists, and other physicians such as neu-
rologists diagnose an additional 18%, 14%, and 15% of cases, 
respectively (3). In 2011, American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) updated guidance for ADHD diagnosis and treatment, 
recommending behavior therapy as the first line of treatment 
ahead of stimulant medication (methylphenidate) for treat-
ment of children aged 4–5 years (10). Guidance for child and

Abstract
Background: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with adverse outcomes and elevated societal 
costs. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2011 guidelines recommend “behavior therapy” over medication as 
first-line treatment for children aged 4–5 years with ADHD; these recommendations are consistent with current guidelines 
from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry for younger children. CDC analyzed claims data to 
assess national and state-level ADHD treatment patterns among young children.
Methods: CDC compared Medicaid and employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) claims for “psychological services” (the 
procedure code category that includes behavior therapy) and ADHD medication among children aged 2–5 years receiving 
clinical care for ADHD, using the MarketScan commercial database (2008–2014) and Medicaid (2008–2011) data. Among 
children with ESI, ADHD indicators were compared during periods preceding and following the 2011 AAP guidelines.
Results: In both Medicaid and ESI populations, the percentage of children aged 2–5 years receiving clinical care for 
ADHD increased over time; however, during 2008–2011, the percentage of Medicaid beneficiaries receiving clinical care 
was double that of ESI beneficiaries. Although state percentages varied, overall nationally no more than 55% of children 
with ADHD received psychological services annually, regardless of insurance type, whereas approximately three fourths 
received medication. Among children with ESI, the percentage receiving psychological services following release of the 
guidelines decreased significantly by 5%, from 44% in 2011 to 42% in 2014; the change in medication treatment rates 
(77% in 2011 compared with 76% in 2014) was not significant.
Conclusions and Comments: Among insured children aged 2–5 years receiving clinical care for ADHD, medication treatment 
was more common than receipt of recommended first-line treatment with psychological services. Among children with ADHD 
who had ESI, receipt of psychological services did not increase after release of the 2011 guidelines. Scaling up evidence-based 
behavior therapy might lead to increased delivery of effective ADHD management without the side effects of ADHD medications.

adolescent psychiatrists also includes the recommendation for 
psychotherapy before medication in the “very young” (11).
Both behavior therapy in the form of “parent training 
in behavior therapy” (also called parent behavior training) 
(Box), and psychostimulant medication for children are 
effective ADHD treatments among those aged <6 years, but 
the strength of evidence for behavior therapy exceeds that for 
psychostimulant medication (12). Behavior therapy might 
require more time for achievement of full impact on child 
behavior and might require more resources; however, the 
impact lasts longer relative to ADHD medication and does 
not have the adverse health effects associated with these medi-
cations (12). Approximately 30% of children aged 3–5 years 
who take ADHD medications experience adverse effects, most 
commonly appetite suppression and sleep problems, but also 
upper abdominal pain (“stomach ache”), emotional outbursts, 
irritability, lack of alertness, repetitive behaviors and thoughts, 
social withdrawal, and irritability when the medication wears 
off (12–14). In a large efficacy trial of methylphenidate, >10% 
of children aged 3–5 years discontinued treatment because of 
adverse effects (13). Children aged 3–5 years taking stimu-
lant medication experience annual growth rates that are 20% 
lower for height (-1.4 cm/year) and 55% lower for weight 
(-1.3 kg/year) (12). This finding is consistent with the rate of 
reduced growth among school-aged children taking stimulant 
medication for ADHD (15). In school-aged children, reduced 
growth rates tend to attenuate over time (16).
Based on parent-reported survey data collected just before the 
2011 AAP guideline release, 53% of children with ADHD aged 
4–5 years had received behavior therapy during the preceding 
year (the survey did not specify whether the therapy was deliv-
ered by a parent trained in behavior therapy or by a therapist 
or some other provider) and 47% had received medication 
treatment during the preceding week (17). National rates of 
ADHD treatment among toddlers aged 2–3 years have not 
been published.
CDC compared rates of psychological services (Box) and 
medication treatment claims among children aged 2–5 years 
receiving clinical care for ADHD in the United States who were 
insured through Medicaid or employer-sponsored insurance 
(ESI). In a sample of children with ESI, comparisons were made 
for years preceding and following release of the 2011 AAP guide-
lines, to assess changes in rates of medication and psychological 
services for ADHD treatment among children aged 2–5 years.
Methods
CDC used two administrative claims data sources to character-
ize ADHD treatment patterns among children aged 2–5 years. 
Annual data from Medicaid Analytic eXtract files from the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for 2008–2011 
were used for children covered by Medicaid insurance for 
≥3 continuous months during each calendar year in 29–34 
states in each year, depending on data availability and usability 
(18–20). During 2008–2011, the years with the most complete 
Medicaid data, data were available for 5–7 million children aged 
2–5 years for each year from 29–34 states. Twenty-six states 
had data available during the entire study period. Data from 
Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters 
files for 2008–2014 were used to derive estimates for children 
covered by ESI. Truven Health provides weights to calculate 
nationally-representative estimates of children covered by ESI 
from this convenience sample. In the analytic sample, there 
were approximately 1 million children aged 2–5 years in the 
MarketScan commercially insured population in each calendar 
year. The annual samples from Medicaid and MarketScan data 
were restricted to children with ≥3 continuous months of cover-
age whose covered prescription drug claims and mental health 
visits were included in the analytic databases.*

and employer-sponsored insurance claims data among children aged 
2–5 years receiving clinical care for attention deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD)
Psychological services for ADHD
One or more nonpharmacological treatment services 
included in a set of current procedure codes. These ser-
vices could be provided directly to the child with ADHD 
or to the parent of the child with ADHD as part of the 
child’s treatment.
Behavior therapy for ADHD
Psychological service interventions that specifically 
change problematic behavior, including ADHD symp-
toms, by altering the physical or social contexts in which 
the behavior occurs. Services can be delivered to the child 
by a therapist, teacher, parent, or other provider.
Parent training in behavior therapy (also called 
parent behavior training) for ADHD
A form of behavior therapy that specifically trains parents 
in methods to modify their child’s problematic behavior, 
including ADHD symptoms. This form of behavior therapy 
has been shown by the Agency for Healthcare Research and 
Quality to have the strongest evidence of effectiveness of 
any ADHD treatment for children aged <6 years.
* For the Medicaid population, about 97% of enrolled children aged 2–5 years 
were enrolled for at least 3 continuous months during each calendar year. For 
the MarketScan sample, approximately 55% of all enrolled children aged 
2–5 years had prescription drug and mental health visit claims contributed to 
the MarketScan data files, and of these, approximately 97% had ≥3 months of 
continuous enrollment.

Three ADHD indicators were developed: receipt of clinical 
care for ADHD, medication treatment, and receipt of psycho-
logical services. Receipt of clinical care for ADHD was defined 
by two or more outpatient claims† with an International 
Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision Clinical Modification 
(ICD-9) code for ADHD (314.XX) that occurred ≥7 days 
apart, or one outpatient claim with an ICD-9 ADHD code 
and two or more claims for FDA-approved ADHD medica-
tions that occurred ≥14 days apart.§ Children in clinical care 
for ADHD were included in the medication treatment group 
if they had one or more ADHD medication claim per year 
and in the psychological services group (Box) if they had one 
or more outpatient claim with a procedure code related to a 
psychological treatment service¶ per year or both. Comparisons 
of ADHD indicators over time for Medicaid were restricted to 
26 states with complete usable data for 2008–2011. Temporal 
trends of the three ADHD indicators were assessed by year 
using the Joinpoint Regression Program (21) to detect any 
change in trends over time, including changes following the 
release of the 2011 AAP guidelines. Comparisons of the three 
indicators were also made using chi-square tests to compare 
rates by age of the child and year. Pearson correlation coef-
ficients were calculated to compare these indicators between 
the Medicaid and ESI populations by year.
Results
Children in Medicaid. In 2011, 106,468 children aged 
2–5 years in 34 Medicaid programs received clinical care 
for ADHD (Table 1), 11,895 (11.2%) of whom were aged 
2–3 years. Among 26 assessed state Medicaid programs, the 
annual percentage of children aged 2–5 years in clinical care 
for ADHD increased from 1.34% (2008) to 1.50% (2011) 
(p<0.001) (Table 1). During 2008-2011, approximately 
78%–79% of children aged 2–5 years in clinical care for 
ADHD received one or more prescriptions for ADHD medi-
cation, and approximately 51%–53% had one or more claims 
for psychological services (Table 1) (Figure). Each year during 
2008–2011, approximately 40% of children with ADHD 
received medication only, approximately 15% received psy-
chological services only, approximately 40% received both, 
and approximately 5% received neither (Table 2). During 
2008–2011, approximately 80% of children aged 4–5 years 
with ADHD received medication, compared with approxi-
mately 60% of children aged 2–3 years (p<0.001). Among 
children with ADHD in Medicaid, approximately 54% and 
56% of children aged 4–5 years and 2–3 years, respectively, 
received psychological services each year; psychological service 
† Outpatient claims included physician, outpatient, and clinic services not related 
to inpatient hospital services, prescription drug services, or long-term care.
§ In order to include all services related to ADHD care, ADHD medication 
claims that did not include ICD-9 codes were included. FDA-approved 
medications to treat ADHD in children of any age included amphetamine and 
mixed amphetamine salts, atomoxetine, clonidine, dextroamphetamine, 
dexmethylphenidate, guanfacine, lisdexamfetamine, and methylphenidate. 
Only dextroamphetamine has been approved for use in children as young as 
age 3 years.

Key Points
• Children diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) can be overly active, have trouble 
paying attention, and/or have difficulty controlling 
behavior. They have higher rates of grade retention, 
high school dropout, unintentional injuries, and 
emergency department visits.
• About 2 million of the more than 6 million children 
with ADHD were diagnosed as young children aged 
2–5 years. Children with more severe ADHD are more 
likely to be diagnosed early. 
• Behavior therapy in the form of “parent training in 
behavior therapy” is the recommended first-line 
treatment for young children with ADHD. It works as 
well as medication without the risk of side effects. The 
American Academy of Pediatrics recommends health 
care providers advise parents of young children with 
ADHD to obtain training in behavior therapy and 
practice that before trying medication.
• Among young children with either Medicaid or 
employer-sponsored insurance, just over 75% of young 
children in clinical care for ADHD received ADHD 
medication for treatment. Yet only about 54% of the 
young children in Medicaid and 45% of the children 
with employer-sponsored insurance (2011) annually 
received psychological services (including parent 
training in behavior therapy). The percentage of young 
children with ADHD receiving psychological services 
also has not increased over time. 
• Increasing delivery of parent training in behavioral 
therapy could lead to improved management of ADHD 
in young children without the side effects of 
ADHD medication.

use was significantly higher among children aged 2–3 years 
than among children aged 4–5 years for each year (p<0.05).
Children with employer-sponsored insurance. Among chil-
dren aged 2–5 years with ESI, approximately 36,000–44,000 
received clinical care for ADHD each year during 2008–2014 
(Table 1), among whom approximately 2,500–3,000 (6%–7%) 
were aged 2–3 years. The percentage of children aged 2–5 years 
with ESI who received clinical care for ADHD increased from 
0.46% in 2008 to 0.60% in 2014 (p<0.001) (Table 1). During 
2011–2014, the percentage of children with ESI and ADHD 
medication claims did not change significantly (76.6% to 
75.7%; p = 0.23); the percentage with psychological services 
claims decreased 5%, from 44.5% to 42.4% (p = 0.009) 
(Table 1) (Figure). The Joinpoint analyses did not detect 
a significant change in trend throughout the entire period 
(2008–2014) for either medication treatment or psychological 
services. During 2008–2014, the distribution of children aged 
2–5 years with ESI and ADHD across treatment groups each 
year was just under half for medication only, approximately 
15% for psychological services only, approximately 30% for 
both, and approximately 10% for neither treatment (Table 2).
Each year during 2008–2014, the percentage of children 
aged 4–5 years with ADHD and ESI who received medica-
tion was higher (range = 77%–79%) than for children aged 
2–3 years (range = 48%–58%) (p<0.001), and a higher 
proportion of children with ADHD aged 2–3 years received 
psychological services than children aged 4–5 years (46%–54% 
compared with 42%–45%; these differences were statistically 
significant in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2014).
Children in Medicaid and children with employer-
sponsored insurance. For the period covered by both databases 
(2008–2011), correlations of state-level percentages of children 
in clinical care for ADHD ranged from 0.74 to 0.87 between 
databases. During 2008–2011, the percentage of children 
aged 2–5 years in Medicaid receiving clinical care for ADHD 
was 2.6–2.9 times greater than that of those with ESI. Across 
all states with available data, the percentage of children with 
ADHD medication claims was similar regardless of insurance 
status, whereas the percentage of children in Medicaid who 
received psychological services was 13%–22% higher than 
among that of those in ESI (Table 1). Among both children 
in Medicaid and children with ESI, ADHD treatment rates 
varied substantially among states within each calendar year.

specific data are available at https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/

children aged 2–5 years received clinical care for ADHD, more 
than two-thirds of whom were Medicaid beneficiaries. Each 
year during 2008–2011, the percentage of children in Medicaid 
receiving care for ADHD was more than twice that for children 
with ESI. This might be accounted for by the higher percentage 
of children with ADHD in poverty (22), the fact that pediatric 
ADHD is a basis of eligibility for disability benefits, or dif-
ferences in behavioral health care practices across health care 
systems that may result in part from state programs that seek 
to ensure the delivery of behavioral health services in Medicaid. 
In both populations, only about 50% of children with ADHD 
received recommended first-line therapy as measured by receipt 
of psychological services, whereas approximately three fourths 
received ADHD medication. ADHD rates varied widely across 
states in both insured groups, possibly because of differences 
in how children with ADHD are identified and served in 
their communities, how these services are documented, or 
both. There was not an increase in psychological services nor 
decrease in use of medication after the AAP guidelines release 
among children with ESI (2011–2014).
 Behavior therapy for ADHD, in the form of parent behav-
ior training, and ADHD medications are both recommended 
ADHD treatments (10,12). However, among children aged 
≤5 years, the number and quality of studies demonstrating 
effectiveness is higher for parent behavior training than for 
ADHD medication (12). In addition, young children are 
more susceptible to adverse health effects of ADHD medica-
tions, whereas adverse health effects have not been reported 
for parent behavior training (12). ADHD treatment with 
behavior therapy, which is typically limited in duration, 
might be associated with better school outcomes (23) and 
more cost-effective over a school year than treatment with 
ongoing medication (24). Further, behavior therapy can also 
improve problematic behavior in young children who present 
with symptoms that look like ADHD, such as symptoms of 
anxiety and oppositional defiant disorder. Collectively, these 
factors support recommendations (10,11) for parent training 
in behavior therapy as first-line treatment for children aged 
≤5 years with ADHD.
There are barriers to the receipt of evidence-based behav-
ior therapy training for families of young children with 
ADHD. First, clinical practice change following guideline 
or policy change takes time, and practices can vary depend-
ing on provider knowledge about the guidelines, the scale 
of the recommended change, and the amount of support 
provided to physicians (25). Parents and physicians might

lack awareness of the recommendations and benefits of behav-
ior therapy. Families might have difficulty identifying and 
accessing providers of evidence-based behavior therapy, and 
these services might require more resources initially to access 
than medication. Behavior therapy might not exist in every 
community, and scaling up these services might be difficult 
and costly. To overcome these barriers, policymakers, state 
agencies, and health professional organizations can continue 
to educate parents and physicians about recommendations 
while expanding capacity to provide evidence-based services. 
State agencies and offices, such as Medicaid and Foster Care, 
can consider programs and policies designed to increase use 
of behavior therapy for ADHD, including using Title IV-E 
funds for the state expansion of evidence-based programs. 
States might also explore policies that influence prescription 
patterns based on existing evidence of safety and effectiveness, 
such as prior-authorization policies. To date, 27 state Medicaid 
programs have implemented prior-authorization policies for 
pediatric ADHD medication prescriptions.** However, it 
is also important to consider strategies to increase access to 
preferred psychological services, particularly among children 
who are denied medication authorization.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, the population evaluated was children receiving 
clinical care for ADHD; thus, these rates do not reflect the 
overall prevalence of children with ADHD. Second, the identi-
fied population did not include children in Medicaid programs 
for which annual data were not available, children receiving 
clinical care not covered by insurance, and children with a 
diagnosis of ADHD who had not received sufficient clinical 
services to meet the case definition. Third, importantly, the 
psychological services indicator lacked precision, and it was 
not possible to assess type or quality of psychological services. 
An inclusive list of psychological services was used as a proxy

or secondary diagnosis in the associated claim. Conversely, not 
all psychological services could be identified using these data 
because some might not have been covered by insurance (e.g., 
self-paid or delivered through the education system). However, 
rates of psychological services among children in this report 
were similar to those reported for children aged 4–5 years in 
2009–2010 using national parent survey data on behavior 
therapy for ADHD not conditional on having insurance (17). 
Fourth, results represent cross-sectional annual percentages 
and not lifetime diagnosis or treatment patterns. In addition, 
children might have been counted multiple times if their insur-
ance status changed during the calendar year (e.g., moved to 
a different state Medicaid program). Finally, MarketScan data 
include only children with ESI and might not be generalizable 
to the entire U.S. population of privately insured children. 
However, in 2014, among the 52% of children aged 0–18 years 
who had private insurance, 90% were covered by ESI (26).
ADHD is a highly prevalent condition that can lead to 
poor health and social outcomes (4–9). Despite 2007 and 
2011 guidelines recommending behavior therapy as first-line 
treatment for children aged <6 years with ADHD, during 
2008–2014 only about half of children aged 2–5 years with 
ADHD received psychological services. To effectively mitigate 
impairments associated with ADHD and minimize risks asso-
ciated with ADHD medications, it is important to increase 
the percentage of young children with ADHD who receive 
evidence-based psychological services, especially parent train-
ing in behavior therapy.
