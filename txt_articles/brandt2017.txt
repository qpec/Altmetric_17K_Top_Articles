 Hospital Admissions for Myocardial Infarction and Stroke
Before and After the Trans-Fatty Acid Restrictions in New York

IMPORTANCE Trans-fatty acids (TFAs) have deleterious cardiovascular effects. Restrictions on
their use were initiated in 11 New York State (NYS) counties between 2007 and 2011. The US
Food and Drug Administration plans a nationwide restriction in 2018. Public health
implications of TFA restrictions are not well understood.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether TFA restrictions in NYS counties were associated with
fewer hospital admissions for myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke compared with NYS
counties without restrictions.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a retrospective observational pre-post
study of residents in counties with TFA restrictions vs counties without restrictions from
2002 to 2013 using NYS Department of Health’
s Statewide Planning and Research
Cooperative System and census population estimates. In this natural experiment, we included
those residents who were hospitalized for MI or stroke. The data analysis was conducted from
December 2014 through July 2016.
EXPOSURE Residing in a county where TFAs were restricted.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a composite of MI and stroke
events based on primary discharge diagnostic codes from hospital admissions in NYS.
Admission rates were calculated by year, age, sex, and county of residence. A
difference-in-differences regression design was used to compare admission rates in
populations with and without TFA restrictions. Restrictions were only implemented in highly
urban counties, based on US Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service Urban
Influence Codes. Nonrestriction counties of similar urbanicity were chosen to make a
comparison population. Temporal trends and county characteristics were accounted for using
fixed effects by county and year, as well as linear time trends by county. We adjusted for age,
sex, and commuting between restriction and nonrestriction counties.
RESULTS In 2006, the year before the first restrictions were implemented, there were 8.4
million adults (53.6% female) in highly urban counties with TFA restrictions and 3.3 million
adults (52.3% female) in highly urban counties without restrictions. Twenty-five counties
were included in the nonrestriction population and 11 in the restriction population. Three or
more years after restriction implementation, the population with TFA restrictions
experienced significant additional decline beyond temporal trends in MI and stroke events
combined (−6.2%; 95% CI, −9.2% to −3.2%; P < .001) and MI (−7.8%; 95% CI, −12.7% to
−2.8%; P = .002) and a nonsignificant decline in stroke (−3.6%; 95% CI, −7.6% to 0.4%;
P = .08) compared with the nonrestriction populations.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The NYS populations with TFA restrictions experienced fewer
cardiovascular events, beyond temporal trends, compared with those without restrictions.

Given the deleterious effects of TFAs, many have advo-
cated minimizing or eliminating their use.9 On June 16, 2015,
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revoked the “Gen-
erally Recognized As Safe” status of PHOs.10-12 The FDA’

Many years prior to the FDA decision to restrict PHOs, local

Reduction in TFA consumption is associated with mean-
ingfulclinicaloutcomes.RestrepoandRieger18reporteda4.5%
reduction in CVD mortality in counties with TFA restrictions
within 1 year after restrictions. The decline in CVD mortality
rates translated to 13 fewer CVD deaths per 100 000 persons
per year after the restrictions were enacted. However, nonfa-
tal events were not reported. Therefore, we sought to deter-
mine the association of TFA restrictions with MI and stroke
events. We hypothesized that NYS populations with TFA re-
strictionsexperiencedareductioninbothMIandstrokeevents
compared with populations without TFA restrictions.
Methods
Included Data
Annual hospital admissions for MI and stroke in all 62 NYS
counties were tracked from January 1, 2002, to December 31,
2013, using data from the NYS Department of Health’
s State-
widePlanningandResearchCooperativeSystem(SPARCS)lim-
ited inpatient data set. Nonfederal public and private hospi-
tals certified for inpatient care in NYS are required to submit
data for all inpatient admissions. The International Classifica-
tion of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnos-
tic codes 410.00 through 410.99 and 430.00 through 438.99
were used to identify principal admission diagnoses of MI or
stroke, respectively, which were established at discharge. The
SPARCS data do not specify whether events were incident or
recurrent. Annual MI and stroke hospitalization rates were cal-
culated by decade of age (starting at 25 years), sex, and county
usingyearlycensuspopulationestimatesasthedenominator.19
Patients’primary zip code of residence, not hospital zip code,
determined county of residence to ensure that patients were
correctly classified as living in TFA restriction vs nonrestric-
tion counties. Adults whose zip code of residence was out-
side of NYS were excluded.
The study was approved by the University of Chicago
institutional review board. This analysis used deidentified
clinical data from SPARCS data of the NYS Department of
Health, so participant consent was not required. Data analy-
sis was conducted from December 2014 through July 2016.
Comparison Groups
We sought to determine whether changes in MI and stroke
eventsafterTFArestrictionsextendedbeyondtemporaltrends.
To construct populations for comparison, we used 2003 and
2013 US Department of Agriculture Economic Research Ser-
vice Urban Influence Codes (UICs) to determine county
urbanicity.20,21 All counties with TFA restrictions had the high-
est urbanicity classifications as UIC-1 (large metropolitan area
of >1 million residents) or UIC-2 (small metropolitan area of <1
million residents) in both 2003 and 2013. Thus, we only in-
cluded hospital admission data from counties without TFA re-
strictions that were classified as UIC-1 or UIC-2 in both 2003
and 2013. In 2 sensitivity analyses, we restricted the analysis
to counties with UIC-1 in both 2003 and 2013 and then ex-
cluded NYC from this analysis.
We measured multiple factors to compare populations liv-
ing in counties with and without TFA restrictions. We used es-
timates from the US Census and Centers for Disease Control
Key Points
Question What is the association between the trans-fatty acid
restrictions in New York State and hospital admissions for
myocardial infarction and stroke?
Findings In this study using data from the New York State
Department of Public Health (2002-2013), there was an additional
6.2% decline in hospital admissions for myocardial infarction and
stroke among populations living in counties with vs without
trans-fatty acid restrictions. The decline in events reached
statistical significance 3 or more years after restrictions were
implemented.
Meaning Restrictions on trans-fatty acid consumption are
associated with a decrease in hospitalization for cardiovascular
events.

 and Prevention in 2006—the year before the first TFA restric-
tion—to calculate the proportion of women, black individu-
als, Hispanic individuals, and adults aged 45 to 65 and older
than 65 years. We also calculated the median income for coun-
ties (reported as range of median incomes), as well as age-
adjusted rates of total mortality, MI, and stroke events, stan-
dardized to the national 2010 population.22,23 Standard
differences (Cohen term d, calculated as the difference in
means divided by the pooled SD) were reported to compare
the restriction and nonrestriction populations, wherein abso-
lute values can be interpreted as small (0.2), medium (0.5), or
large (≥0.8).24
Statistical Analysis
To distinguish between changes related to TFA restrictions and
temporal trends, we used a difference-in-differences nega-
tive binomial regression strategy.25 The difference-in-
differences approach compares trends in admission rates be-
fore and after TFA restrictions in counties with and without
restrictions. The approach is designed to study 2 populations
that may not have the same absolute event rates but do have
parallel trends in event rates before 1 population experiences
an intervention. The key assumption is that if 2 populations
hadparalleltrendsinthepast,theseparalleltrendswouldhave
continued in the absence of an intervention. Therefore, if one
population undergoes an intervention, data from the other
population can be used to predict what would have occurred
in that population without the intervention. One can then
measure the difference between the observed and expected
differences between groups. The difference-in-differences
approach represents the change attributable to the interven-
tion (eFigure 1 in Supplement). We tested for parallel trends

 in admission rates prior to 2007, the year the first TFA restric-
tion was enacted, using negative binomial regression models.
The assumption of parallel trends before the policy change
is necessary but not sufficient to ascertain the internal valid-
ity of the method. Additional potential confounding due to dif-
ferences in counties with and without TFA restrictions was ad-
dressed in several ways. First, by adding county fixed effects,
we controlled for unobserved county characteristics that re-
mained unbalanced (but remained fixed over time) across the
studyperiod.Assuch,weusedwithin-countyvariationtocom-
pare hospital admissions before vs after each TFA restriction
occurred, which allowed us to account for different periods of
TFArestrictionimplementation.Second,weaccountedforpre-
restriction MI and stroke event rates by adding linear trends
at the county level. Third, year fixed effects were incorpo-
rated to control for year-specific shifts, such as economic
changes, which could affect restaurant use. We clustered SEs
to account for the repeated observations at the county level.
We also accounted for commuting between counties with
and without TFA restrictions because commuters from non-
restriction counties into a restriction county would be ex-
posedtoaTFArestrictioniftheyaterestaurantmealsneartheir
workplace. To account for commuting in the model, we added
2 variables as controls in the regression, capturing the propor-
tionoftheadultpopulationcommutingfromcountieswithTFA
restrictionstocountieswithoutTFArestrictionsandviceversa.
Theproportionofadultsthatcommutesbetweencountieswith
and without TFA restrictions was determined using data from
the American Community Survey’
s Commuting Worker
Flows.26,27 The American Community Survey tracks a popu-
lation’
scountyofresidenceandcountyofwork.Estimatesfrom
2006-2010 and 2009-2013 were used. In overlapping years,
we used an average of the 2 estimates.
Our primary outcome was a composite of MI and stroke
event rates. Secondary outcomes were MI and stroke individu-
ally. Negative binomial regression models were used in which
events were modeled as rates per population, adjusting for de-
cade of age, sex, county, year, and commuting between coun-
ties; linear time trends (estimated separately for each county);
andexposuretoTFArestrictions.Eventsandpopulationcounts
were tabulated by age, sex, year, and county for inclusion in
the model. Given that there may be a delay between change
in TFA consumption and its association with cardiovascular
events, we report results at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 or more years
after restrictions were implemented.
In some counties, the TFA restrictions were implemented
in 2 phases. For example, on July 1, 2007, phase 1 of the NYC
restriction eliminated using PHOs for frying, pan-frying, grill-
ing, or as a spread. Partially hydrogenated oils used for deep-
frying,cakebatter,andyeastdoughwerepermitteduntilphase
2, which began July 1, 2008. When applicable, phase 1 imple-
mentation dates were used because this was the earliest date
of reduced TFA exposure. Restriction start dates for all coun-
ties were assumed to start at the nearest half-year to the effec-
tive restriction date.
We performed sensitivity analyses to ensure NYC did not
drive the results. Because all NYC counties are UIC-1, we first
restricted the analyses to UIC-1 counties. We then repeated the
analysis after excluding NYC. We examined the effect of data
specifically after excluding NYC for 2 reasons. First, NYC had
the longest exposure to a TFA restriction. Second, NYC also
implemented other public health measures during our pe-
riod of observation, such as smoking and food menu regula-
tions, which could have affected rates of MI and stroke.
The analyses were performed using Stata version 14
(StataCorp). For all analyses, a 2-tailed P < .05 was consid-
ered statistically significant.
Results
Population Characteristics
In the UIC-1 populations, there were 9 counties with TFA re-
strictions and 8 counties without restrictions. In the UIC-2
populations, there were 2 counties with TFA restrictions and
17 counties without restrictions, giving a total study sample
of 11 counties with restrictions and 25 without restrictions.
Figure 1 provides a map of counties included in the analyses.
Characteristics of the study populations are shown in
Table 1. When comparing TFA restriction and nonrestriction
populations (UIC-1 or UIC-2), they were most similar on age-
adjusted MI and stroke rates. There were large differences be-
tween the TFA restriction and nonrestriction populations in
the proportion of black and Hispanic adults (Table 1). The re-
sults were similar when we compared only UIC-1 populations
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). When excluding NYC from UIC-1
populations, the population characteristics were similar, al-
though the difference in the proportion of black adults be-
tween populations with and without TFA restrictions was
smaller (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Baseline Trends in Cardiovascular Events
Before TFA restrictions, annual admission rates were already
declining across the state (Figure 2). Trends in admissions for
MI and stroke event rates combined, MI, and stroke before
implementation of TFA restrictions were comparable be-
tween the populations with and without TFA restrictions in all
analyses (Figure 2; Table 2; eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Cardiovascular Events After Trans-Fatty Acid Restrictions
By 3 or more years after TFA restrictions were enacted, there
was a significant additional decline in admissions for the pri-
mary end point of MI and stroke combined (−6.2%; 95% CI,
−9.2% to −3.2%; P < .001) beyond temporal trends in UIC-1 or
UIC-2 populations with vs without TFA restrictions. The de-
cline in events equates to 43 events averted per 100 000. For
secondary end points, there was a significant decline in MI
(−7.8%; 95% CI, −12.7% to −2.8%; P = .002) and a nonsignifi-
cant decline in stroke (−3.6%; 95% CI, −7.6% to 0.4%; P = .08)
(Table 3). Results were similar for both men and women
(Table 3).
In the sensitivity analyses, when we restricted the sample
to UIC-1 populations and also excluded NYC from UIC-1
populations, the results were unchanged (Table 3). For sensi-
tivity analyses results stratified by sex, see eTable 2 in the
Supplement.

 Discussion
Myocardial infarction and stroke rates were already declining
across NYS prior to the first TFA restrictions. After 2006, popu-
lations in NYS with TFA restrictions experienced a significant
additional decline in rates of hospital admissions for MI and
strokeratescombinedcomparedwithpopulationswithoutTFA
restrictions, beyond what would have been expected based on
temporal trends. The significant decline in events became
apparent 3 or more years after the restrictions were imple-
mented. Both men and women experienced a significant
decline in events. To our knowledge, this is the first study
examining the association between TFA restrictions in NYS
with MI and stroke.
Consumption of TFAs has been shown to increase the risk
for coronary heart disease and stroke over 6 or more years of
follow-up.3,4,8 Just 2 g of daily TFA consumption portends sig-
nificant risk for CVD; complete avoidance may be necessary
to avert risk.2,28 However, it is possible to reach significant TFA
intake with just 1 food item. For example, a large order of Pop-
eye’
s Louisiana Kitchen cajun fries contains 3.5 g of TFAs per
serving,29 Taco Bell’
s Cinnabon Delights (12-pack) contain 2.0
g of TFAs per serving,30 and multiple varieties of Pillsbury
Shape sugar cookies contain 2.5 g of TFAs per serving.31 Stud-
ies after the NYS restrictions found a clinically meaningful
reduction in TFA exposure. For example, a random sample of

 fast-food purchases in NYC suggested that TFA consumption
decreased by an average of 2.4 g per meal between 2007 and
2009.32 Additionally, 16 months after implementation of
phase 1 of the NYC TFA restriction, use of TFAs had decreased
from 50% of restaurants to less than 2%.33 In Nassau County,
81% of randomly inspected food service establishments
were compliant within 3 to 5 months after TFA restriction
implementation.34
Our results complement those of previous analyses. For
example, Restrepo and Rieger18 used US Centers for Disease
ControlandPreventionmortalitydatatodemonstratethatTFA
restrictions in NYS were associated with a reduction in CVD
mortality. Also similar to our study, the authors found that the
reduction in heart disease mortality (11 per 100 000 persons/
year) was larger than the reduction in stroke mortality (2 per
100 000persons/year).18Furthermore,thereductioninMIthat
we observed falls within the predicted bounds by Mozaffar-
ian et al,2 who estimated that near elimination of TFAs from
diets would prevent 6% to 19% of coronary heart disease
events.
It is important to consider other public health measures
that coincided with the TFA restrictions and could have af-
fected rates of MI and stroke. To our knowledge, there were 2
relevant measures in NYC: the 2011 extension of the Smoke-
Free Air Act, which extended smoking bans to parks, beaches,
and pedestrian plazas, and the 2008 measure to post caloric
contentonfoodmenus.35,36However,ourresultsremainedsig-

 nificant for UIC-1 populations when excluding NYC from the
analyses. As a result, it is unlikely that our results were con-
founded by the public health measures.
It is possible that our results are related to unmeasured dif-
ferences between the 2 groups. For example, using data from
the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Restrepo and
Rieger18 showed that while rates of obesity, smoking, and al-
cohol use were lower in restriction vs nonrestriction coun-
ties, physical activity was also lower in restriction vs nonre-
striction counties. However, adjusting for the differences in
lifestyle factors between restriction and nonrestriction coun-
ties did not alter the authors’results. In addition, both Re-
strepo and Rieger’
s analysis and ours included county-level
fixed effects and county-specific linear time trends to adjust
fordifferencesbetweencounties.Nevertheless,therecouldstill
be residual confounding.
It is notable that the reduction in MI and stroke rates oc-
curred after TFA restrictions that only included limiting of TFA
consumption from eateries.15 Consumers could be exposed to
TFA from other products not included in the restriction. For
example,ingrocerystores,foodslabeledas0gofTFAsperserv-
ing may contain up to 0.49 g of TFAs based on current label-
ing guidelines.28,37 Our results show the potential benefit of
the FDA’
s comprehensive restriction on PHOs, which is the
source of TFAs in most packaged food.
Strengths
Our study has a number of strengths. Our analyses are com-
prehensive, as SPARCS data include admissions from all non-
federal hospitals in NYS. Events were classified according to
each adult’
s county of residence rather than the hospital lo-
cation, allowing tracking of events based on restriction expo-
sure. The benefit of the difference-in-differences approach is
that population-level factors that differ between comparison
groups do not bias the results as long as trends between the
comparison groups would have remained parallel in the ab-
sence of an intervention. Prerestriction trends were similar
across populations with vs without TFA restrictions. Further-
more, we accounted for additional exposure to TFA restric-
tionsbyadjustingforcommutingbetweenrestrictionandnon-
restriction counties. Last, the effect of the restriction exhibited
a dose-response by time, wherein there was typically greater
degree of decline and significance of decline in events with the
passage of time, which is the biologically expected response
to cardiovascular risk factor modification.
Limitations
Our study has limitations. First, we were not able to assess
population-level changes in TFA consumption. Second, race/
ethnicity was poorly reported in SPARCS and so we did not ad-
just for it or stratify results by race/ethnicity.38 However,
county-level indicators and time trends helped to adjust for
differences across populations with vs without TFA restric-
tions, such as differences in racial/ethnic composition of the
population. Also, despite differences in race/ethnicity, slopes
were not different between populations with and without TFA
restrictions. Third, MI and stroke events that did not result in
hospital admission within NYS were not captured. Fourth, al-
though we control for linear trends over time on the county
level, additional differences between comparison counties
could have developed over time that were not accounted for
in our analysis.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that the NYS restrictions on TFAs in eat-
eries were associated with an accelerated decline in hospital
admissions for MI and stroke. The difference between TFA re-
striction and nonrestriction populations was significant 3 or
more years after restriction implementation.
