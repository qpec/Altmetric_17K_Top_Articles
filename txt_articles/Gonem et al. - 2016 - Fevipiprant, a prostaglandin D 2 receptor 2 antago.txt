Abstract 
26 
Background 
27 
Eosinophilic airway inflammation is often present in asthma and interventions that reduce it 
28 
result in improved clinical outcomes. Antagonism of the prostaglandin D2 receptor 2 (DP2) 
29 
may reduce eosinophilic airway inflammation. 
30 
 
31 
Methods 
32 
We performed a single-centre, 12-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
33 
parallel-group clinical trial of the DP2 receptor antagonist fevipiprant (QAW039) 225mg 
34 
twice per day orally in 61 subjects with persistent moderate-to-severe asthma and an elevated 
35 
sputum eosinophil count. The primary outcome was the change in sputum eosinophil 
36 
percentage from baseline to post-treatment. Secondary and exploratory outcomes included 
37 
changes in Asthma Control Questionnaire score (ACQ-7), standardised Asthma Quality of 
38 
Life Score (AQLQ(S)), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and bronchial 
39 
submucosal inflammation. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01545726). 
40 
 
41 
Findings 
42 
Sputum eosinophil percentage fell from a geometric mean of 5·4% at baseline to 1·1% post-
43 
treatment in the fevipiprant group and from 4·7% at baseline to 3·9% post-treatment in the 
44 
placebo group (between group difference 3·5-fold; 95% confidence interval 1·7 to 7·0; p = 
45 
0·0014).  Bronchial submucosal eosinophils were reduced 2.5-fold in the fevipiprant group 
46 
compared to placebo (p = 0.040). ACQ-7 score fell by 0·32 points in the fevipiprant group 
47 
compared to placebo (p = 0·17) and by 0.56 points in the subgroup with poor control (≥1.5 
48 
points) at baseline (p = 0.046). In the fevipiprant group compared to placebo AQLQ(S) 
49 
 3 
 
improved by 0.59 points (p = 0.0080) and post-bronchodilator FEV1 improved by 0.16 L (p = 
50 
0.021). Fevipiprant displayed a favourable safety profile, with no serious adverse events 
51 
reported. 
52 
 
53 
Interpretation 
54 
Fevipiprant reduces eosinophilic airway inflammation in patients with persistent asthma and 
55 
raised sputum eosinophil counts despite inhaled corticosteroid treatment. This is associated 
56 
with improved lung function and asthma-related quality of life, and a favourable safety 
57 
profile.

Research in context 
62 
Evidence before this study 
63 
We searched PubMed for reports published in English before February 1 2016, on the use of 
64 
DP2/CRTH2 receptor antagonists in asthma with the terms “DP2”, “CRTH2”, “prostaglandin 
65 
D2”, and “asthma”. We also searched the reference lists of identified reports. The most 
66 
relevant reports identified were of two randomised controlled trials of the compound 
67 
OC000459, which was found to improve forced expiratory volume in one second and asthma 
68 
quality of life in steroid-naïve patients. The compound BI671800 was evaluated in two 
69 
separate randomised controlled trials, one in steroid-naïve adults with asthma, and one in 
70 
patients receiving inhaled fluticasone. In both cases, six weeks of treatment resulted in 
71 
modest but statistically significant improvements in forced expiratory volume in one second 
72 
compared to placebo. 
73 
 
74 
Added value of this study 
75 
This is the first study to evaluate a DP2 receptor antagonist in a group of patients with 
76 
moderate-to-severe asthma. We showed that fevipiprant reduces eosinophilic airway 
77 
inflammation in this group of patients and is associated with improved lung function and 
78 
asthma-related quality of life. Control of eosinophilic airway inflammation is an important 
79 
goal of asthma treatment since it has been previously shown to reduce asthma exacerbation 
80 
rates.  
81 
 
82 
Implications of all the available evidence 
83 
Fevipiprant is potentially an important advance because it is a well-tolerated orally acting 
84 
agent which achieves significant reductions in eosinophilic airway inflammation in patients 
85 
 5 
 
with moderate-to-severe asthma who are already receiving high-dose inhaled or oral 
86 
corticosteroids.

Introduction 
89 
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease that is characterised by heterogeneity with 
90 
respect to clinical phenotype and response to therapy1. Eosinophilic airway inflammation, 
91 
mediated by type 2 immunity, is a common feature of asthma1. Treatment strategies that 
92 
specifically target eosinophilic airway inflammation substantially reduce exacerbations of 
93 
asthma in those patients with uncontrolled eosinophilic airway inflammation, and to a lesser 
94 
extent improve lung function and asthma control2–7. 
95 
 
96 
There is increasing evidence that prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), acting upon the DP2 receptor, 
97 
also known as receptor homologous molecule expressed on T-helper 2 cells (CRTH2), may 
98 
play an important role in mediating eosinophilic airway inflammation in asthma. The DP2 
99 
receptor mediates the migration of T-helper 2 (TH2) cells, delays their apoptosis and 
100 
stimulates them to produce the cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-138–10. DP2 also influences the 
101 
migration of and cytokine release from type 2 innate lymphoid cells11, and importantly the 
102 
receptor is expressed by eosinophils, and directly mediates their chemotaxis and 
103 
degranulation12,13. The number of DP2+ cells in the bronchial submucosa increases with 
104 
increasing severity of asthma14. DP2 is also expressed on airway epithelial cells and directly 
105 
promotes their migration and differentiation14. DP2 is therefore a highly promising novel drug 
106 
target in the treatment of asthma. Fevipiprant (QAW039) is an orally administered highly 
107 
selective and potent antagonist of the DP2 receptor, but not to the more general homeostatic 
108 
PGD2 receptor DP1.  
109 
 
110 
We tested the hypothesis that, in patients with sputum eosinophilia (≥ 2%) and persistent, 
111 
moderate-to-severe asthma, 12-weeks’ treatment with fevipiprant at a dose of 225mg twice 
112 
per day, on top of conventional treatment, reduces the levels of eosinophils in induced 
113 
 7 
 
sputum compared to placebo. Secondary objectives were to determine the effects of 
114 
fevipiprant on asthma symptoms, as measured by the seven-point Asthma Control 
115 
Questionnaire (ACQ-7)15, and to assess safety and tolerability of fevipiprant. Exploratory 
116 
objectives included assessment of the effect of fevipiprant on the forced expiratory volume in 
117 
one second (FEV1), lung volumes using body plethysmography, health-related quality of life 
118 
as measured by the standardised Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ(S))16, airway 
119 
inflammation and remodelling in bronchial biopsies and airway morphometry and lung 
120 
density assessed by quantitative computed tomography (CT).  
121 
 
122 
Methods 
123 
Subjects 
124 
Participants were older than 18 years of age and had a clinical diagnosis of asthma that was 
125 
supported by one or more objective criteria, as described in the appendix. Participants were 
126 
recruited from a regional refractory asthma clinic providing tertiary care for a population of 4 
127 
million people. Suitable participants were also identified from secondary care asthma and 
128 
general respiratory clinics in the region, and through screening of local primary care 
129 
databases. Inclusion criteria were current treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), a 
130 
sputum eosinophil count of ≥ 2% at screening, and either an ACQ-7 score ≥ 1·5 at 
131 
randomization or ≥ 1 severe exacerbations in the past 12 months requiring an increase in 
132 
systemic corticosteroid therapy for three days or more. Exclusion criteria included serious 
133 
coexisting illness and pregnancy or lactation, and are listed in full in the appendix. All 
134 
subjects provided written informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the National 
135 
Research Ethics Committee (Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Rutland, approval no. 
136 
11/EM/0402) and the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory 
137 
 8 
 
Agency. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01545726) and EudraCT 
138 
(2011-004966-13). 
139 
 
140 
Design of the study 
141 
The study was a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
142 
clinical trial conducted from February 2012 through June 2013. The funding organisation 
143 
(Novartis Pharmaceuticals) supplied the study drug and placebo.  
144 
 
145 
The study design is illustrated in Figure 1a. Participants were given the option of undergoing 
146 
bronchoscopy at the baseline and post-treatment visits as part of the study. Patients attended a 
147 
screening visit (Visit 1, Day -21), at which inclusion and exclusion criteria were reviewed. 
148 
Regular treatment was kept constant from this time point until the end of the study. One week 
149 
later, a two-week single-blind placebo run-in period was commenced (Visit 2, Day -14). 
150 
Following this, patients attended a baseline visit (Visit 3, Day 0), at which the inclusion and 
151 
exclusion criteria were again assessed, taking into account the ACQ-7 score. If patients 
152 
fulfilled the criteria, they proceeded to undertake the remainder of the study visit tests, and 
153 
were then randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either fevipiprant at a dose of 225 mg twice per 
154 
day, or an identical placebo. Patients attended a mid-treatment visit (Visit 4, Day 42), and a 
155 
post-treatment visit (Visit 5, Day 84). At the post-treatment visit, patients began a six-week 
156 
single-blind placebo washout period, and then attended an end-of-study visit (Visit 6, Day 
157 
126). Details of measurements and safety assessments performed at each study visit are 
158 
shown in the appendix. Criteria for withdrawal from the study were defined a priori, and 
159 
included withdrawal of informed consent, asthma exacerbation, pregnancy, and adverse 
160 
events for which continued exposure to the study drug would be detrimental.  
161 
 
162 
 9 
 
Randomisation and masking 
163 
Randomisation was performed by the trial pharmacist using previously generated treatment 
164 
allocation cards, and was stratified by whether or not participants were receiving treatment 
165 
with regular oral corticosteroids, and whether they were undergoing bronchoscopy. All other 
166 
site staff, patients and sponsor personnel remained blinded to treatment allocation until the 
167 
study had been completed and the trial database locked. Results of sputum and blood 
168 
eosinophil counts subsequent to the baseline visit were not disclosed to the investigators 
169 
during the study because of the expected anti-eosinophilic effects of fevipiprant. 
170 
 
171 
Statistical analysis 
172 
The primary outcome of the study was the change in sputum eosinophil percentage between 
173 
the baseline visit and the post-treatment visit. As sputum eosinophil percentage is known to 
174 
follow a log-normal distribution, the analysis was based on a log10-transformed scale with 
175 
results back-transformed to obtain the within-group ratios of geometric means at the end of 
176 
treatment compared to baseline. We report the reciprocal of these ratios as fold-reductions 
177 
from baseline within each group, and the ratio of these ratios as a measure of how many times 
178 
greater the reduction in the fevipiprant group was compared to the reduction in the placebo 
179 
group. The secondary outcome was the change from baseline to post-treatment with respect 
180 
to ACQ-7 score. Exploratory outcomes included the change from baseline to post-treatment 
181 
with respect to ACQ-7 score in the subgroup with baseline score ≥ 1·5, AQLQ(S) score, 
182 
FEV1 and submucosal eosinophil count on bronchial biopsy. Statistical analyses were 
183 
performed using SAS/STAT software, versions 9·3 and 9·4 of the SAS System for AIX (SAS 
184 
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and Prism 6 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA). Changes in 
185 
efficacy outcomes from the baseline to post-treatment visits were analysed using an analysis 
186 
of covariance (ANCOVA) model, with treatment as the fixed effect. Randomisation strata 
187 
 10 
 
and baseline values of efficacy variables were entered as factors in the ANCOVA model for 
188 
analysis of the primary outcome, secondary outcome and exploratory outcomes detailed in 
189 
the statistical analysis plan (see Supplementary Appendix). Exploratory endpoints not 
190 
explicitly detailed in the statistical analysis plan were analysed without correction for 
191 
randomisation stratum or baseline values. Efficacy outcomes were analysed by intention to 
192 
treat and safety outcomes were analysed by treatment received. One patient was assigned to 
193 
fevipiprant but incorrectly dispensed placebo at the mid-treatment visit. One patient was 
194 
assigned to fevipiprant but incorrectly dispensed placebo throughout the course of the study. 
195 
They were included in the fevipiprant group for efficacy analyses, but the latter patient was 
196 
included in the placebo group for safety analyses. The planned sample size of 60 randomised 
197 
patients was calculated so that at least 24 patients per arm would complete the post-treatment 
198 
assessment in order to ensure 80% power at the two-sided 5% significance, assuming a 50% 
199 
reduction in sputum eosinophil percentage with fevipiprant17.

The sponsor contributed to the study design, data interpretation and writing of the report, and 
203 
coordinated data collection and analysis. The authors had full access to the data and vouch for 
204 
the accuracy of the findings. The corresponding author had final responsibility for the 
205

207 
Results 
208 
Participants were recruited between Feb 10, 2012 and Jan 30, 2013. A total of 117 patients 
209 
attended a screening visit, of which 61 fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were 
210 
randomised (Figure 1b). Thirty-one patients were assigned to receive placebo and 30 to 
211 
receive fevipiprant. Four patients withdrew in the placebo group and three patients in the 
212 
 11 
 
fevipiprant group, in each case due to an exacerbation of asthma. The randomised groups 
213 
were well-matched for baseline characteristics, as shown in Table 1. Efficacy outcomes are 
214 
shown in Figures 2-4, and in Tables S1-S3 in the appendix. 
215 
 
216 
The geometric mean sputum eosinophil percentage fell from 5·4% at baseline to 1·1% post-
217 
treatment in the fevipiprant group, and from 4·7% at baseline to 3·9% post-treatment in the 
218 
placebo group. The ratio of geometric means post-treatment to baseline for the sputum 
219 
eosinophil percentage was 0·78 (1·3-fold reduction) in the placebo group and 0·22 (4·5-fold 
220 
reduction) in the fevipiprant group, with a 3·5-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] 1·7 to 7·0-
221 
fold) greater reduction in the fevipiprant group compared to placebo (p = 0·0014).  
222 
 
223 
The mean ACQ-7 score fell by 0·32 points from baseline to post-treatment in the fevipiprant 
224 
group compared to the change seen with placebo, but this improvement did not reach 
225 
statistical significance (95% CI -0·78, 0·14; p = 0·17). However, among the subset of patients 
226 
(n = 40) uncontrolled at baseline (ACQ-7 score ≥ 1·5), the mean ACQ-7 score fell by 0·56 
227 
points compared to placebo, which was both clinically and statistically significant (95% CI -
228 
1·12, -0·01; p = 0·046). The mean AQLQ(S) score improved by 0·59 points in the fevipiprant 
229 
group compared to placebo, which was statistically significant (95% CI 0·16, 1·03; p = 
230 
0·0080). The mean post-bronchodilator FEV1 increased by 0·16L from baseline to post-
231 
treatment in the fevipiprant group compared to placebo, with a statistically significant 
232 
difference between the groups (95% CI 0·03, 0·30; p = 0·021). There were no significant 
233 
differences between the groups with respect to changes in pre-bronchodilator FEV1. There 
234 
were no significant changes in peripheral blood eosinophil count or exhaled nitric oxide in 
235 
either group. 
236 
 
237 
 12 
 
Paired bronchial biopsies (baseline and post-treatment) were obtained in 14 patients in the 
238 
fevipiprant group and 12 patients in the placebo group. We observed a 2·5-fold greater 
239 
reduction in bronchial submucosal eosinophil numbers from baseline to post-treatment in the 
240 
fevipiprant group compared to the placebo group (p = 0·040). There was a 1·4-fold reduction 
241 
in bronchial epithelial eosinophil numbers from baseline in favour of fevipiprant, but the 
242 
treatment difference did not reach statistical significance. Subjects treated with fevipiprant 
243 
demonstrated a 27·8 percentage point increase in the proportion of intact epithelium (95% CI 
244 
2·9, 52·7; p = 0·030), and a 26·6 percentage point reduction in the proportion of denuded 
245 
epithelium (95% CI -44·9, -8·3; p = 0·0062), compared to the change seen with placebo. 
246 
Changes in epithelial integrity were not significantly correlated with changes in sputum or 
247 
bronchial mucosal eosinophilic inflammation, as shown in Figure S1 in the appendix.  
248 
 
249 
Functional residual capacity (FRC) fell by 0·31 L in the fevipiprant group compared to the 
250 
change seen with placebo (95% CI -0·62, -0·001; p = 0·049) and expiratory CT lung volume 
251 
fell by 216 cm3 in the fevipiprant group compared to the placebo group (95% CI -391, -40; p 
252 
= 0·017), but no significant treatment differences were observed with respect to other 
253 
quantitative CT parameters. Significant positive correlations were observed between changes 
254 
in plethysmographic and CT-derived measures of expiratory air trapping, as shown in Figure 
255 
S2 in the appendix.  
256 
 
257 
Outcomes measured following the 6 week washout period returned to baseline without any 
258 
significant differences between baseline and post-washout for any outcome. Fevipiprant had 
259 
an acceptable side-effect profile throughout the study period. Total adverse events and 
260 
adverse events within each organ class were balanced between the two treatment groups. 
261 
 13 
 
There were no deaths or serious adverse events reported, and no patient withdrawals 
262 
suspected by the investigator to be related to the study drug, as shown in Table 2. 
263 
 
264 
Discussion 
265 
We found that fevipiprant significantly reduced eosinophilic inflammation in the sputum and 
266 
bronchial submucosa compared to placebo in patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe 
267 
asthma and sputum eosinophilia. Fevipiprant significantly improved AQLQ(S) scores, post-
268 
bronchodilator FEV1 and functional residual capacity compared to placebo in all patients, and 
269 
ACQ-7 scores in the sub-group of patients who had poor asthma control at baseline (ACQ-7 
270 
≥ 1·5 points). Exploratory analyses of bronchial biopsies suggested that fevipiprant led to 
271 
improvements in epithelial integrity, but did not affect epithelial goblet cell number or 
272 
MUC5A expression.  
273 
 
274 
The magnitude of reduction in eosinophilic inflammation reported here was comparable to 
275 
that observed with mepolizumab3,4. Unlike mepolizumab3,4, and other anti-IL5(R) targeted 
276 
biologics reslizumab and benralizumab, fevipiprant did not have any significant effect on the 
277 
blood eosinophil count. This suggests that DP2 receptor blockade attenuates the migration of 
278 
eosinophils into the airway tissues, but is unlikely to have a substantial effect upon release 
279 
from the bone marrow although it might exert a small indirect effect through a reduction in 
280 
circulating IL-510,11. Previous interventional studies have shown that anti-eosinophilic 
281 
treatments or strategies exert their major therapeutic effect through the reduction in asthma 
282 
exacerbations2–5,7, although effects on FEV1 have also been observed, particularly in patients 
283 
with blood eosinophilia6,7. The treatment period in this study was not long enough to observe 
284 
a significant effect on exacerbations. Whether fevipiprant reduces the frequency of 
285 
exacerbations in patients with eosinophilic asthma is an important question for future studies.  
286 
 14 
 
 
287 
We noted a prompt return to baseline values following a six-week placebo wash-out period in 
288 
the fevipiprant group with respect to sputum eosinophil percentage, ACQ-7 and AQLQ(S) 
289 
scores, and post-bronchodilator FEV1. There were no statistically significant differences 
290 
between baseline values and those recorded following the placebo wash-out. This suggests 
291 
that the short-term improvements in asthma quality of life and post-bronchodilator FEV1 seen 
292 
with fevipiprant were driven by reversible processes rather than underlying disease 
293 
modification. However, we observed significant improvements in epithelial integrity 
294 
following 12 weeks of treatment with fevipiprant compared to placebo. Whether this effect 
295 
was a consequence of reduced eosinophilic inflammation which is known to cause epithelial 
296 
damage or a direct effect upon epithelial repair and differentiation as observed in vitro14 
297 
remains uncertain, although the lack of an association between changes in sputum eosinophil 
298 
counts and epithelial integrity in response to fevipiprant favours a direct mechanistic effect 
299 
upon the epithelium.  
300 
 
301 
Previous clinical trials of DP2 receptor antagonists in asthma have yielded mixed results. The 
302 
compound OC000459 was found to improve pre-bronchodilator FEV1 and asthma quality of 
303 
life in steroid-free patients19, with a subsequent study finding that the beneficial effect was 
304 
confined to patients with a baseline peripheral blood eosinophil count >250/μl20. However, 
305 
this compound has not yet been tested in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. AMG853, 
306 
a dual DP1 and DP2 antagonist, was not effective in improving asthma symptoms or either 
307 
pre- or post-bronchodilator FEV1 in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma21, but there is 
308 
evidence that DP1 and DP2 stimulation may have opposing effects on a number of 
309 
inflammatory mechanisms22. The efficacy of BI671800 was evaluated in two separate 
310 
randomised controlled trials, one in steroid-naïve adults with asthma, and one in patients 
311 
 15 
 
receiving inhaled fluticasone23. In both cases, six weeks of treatment resulted in modest but 
312 
statistically significant improvements in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 compared to placebo. In 
313 
these previous studies patient selection was not based upon evidence of eosinophilic airway

inflammation. Previous experience has shown that targeting anti-eosinophilic therapies to 
315 
patients with evidence of uncontrolled type 2 inflammation is associated with more clear 
316 
evidence of efficacy3–7, and the positive results obtained in our study should therefore not be 
317 
extrapolated to an unselected group of patients with moderate-to-severe asthma.  
318 
 
319 
One limitation of our study is the relatively small sample size undertaken in a single centre. 
320 
However, the effect size in our primary outcome the sputum eosinophil count was large and 
321 
other positive clinical outcomes showed both statistically and clinically important differences 
322 
between the fevipiprant and placebo groups. Furthermore, our study design allowed a 
323 
significant loss of efficacy to be demonstrated when fevipiprant was stopped.  In contrast to 
324 
many clinical trials the clinical outcomes in the group that received placebo were typically 
325 
worse following intervention compared to their baseline, suggesting deterioration in this 
326 
group. The lack of a positive placebo effect in this study may be explained by the fact that 
327 
many of the participants were drawn from a tertiary refractory asthma clinic, and their 
328 
treatment had previously been fully optimised. We also included a two-week single-blind 
329 
placebo run-in period prior to the baseline visit specifically in order to minimise the placebo 
330 
effect. Finally, our inclusion and exclusion criteria mandated a six-week period of clinical 
331 
stability before patients could participate in the study, thus minimising the potential for 
332 
changes to occur as a result of regression to the mean. Baseline characteristics of the groups 
333 
were in general well-matched, although the median inhaled corticosteroid dose was 
334 
numerically higher in the fevipiprant group than the placebo group. However, since 
335 
background treatment remained stable throughout the study it is unlikely that this would have 
336 
 16 
 
caused a systematic bias in the efficacy outcome measures. During the study two dispensing 
337 
errors occurred, with one patient randomised to fevipiprant and receiving placebo throughout, 
338 
and a second randomised to fevipiprant and receiving placebo in the second half of the 
339 
treatment period. Since efficacy outcomes were analysed by intention to treat, this could have 
340 
increased the chance of a type II error. However, when efficacy outcomes were analysed by 
341 
treatment received there were no significant changes in the results obtained (data not shown). 
342 
 
343 
We conclude that the DP2 receptor antagonist fevipiprant is effective at attenuating 
344 
eosinophilic airway inflammation in patients with persistent eosinophilic asthma, and appears 
345 
to have a favourable safety profile over a 12-week treatment period. There is evidence that 
346 
fevipiprant improves lung function and asthma-related quality of life, as well as expiratory air 
347 
trapping and epithelial integrity. Longer-term multi-centre studies are required to confirm 
348 
these findings and to investigate the effect of fevipiprant on asthma exacerbations.

Figure 1: Summary of study protocol and participant flow 
Panel A shows the timings of study visits and treatment allocations. Panel B shows the 
number of patients who attended screening, were randomised, and completed each of the 
study visits. 
 
Figure 2: Comparison of eosinophilic inflammation outcomes between the study groups 
Panels A and B show fold-reductions in sputum and blood eosinophil counts respectively at 
each study visit compared to the baseline visit, in the placebo (blue square) and fevipiprant 
(orange circle) groups. P values refer to differences between the study groups with respect to 
change from the baseline visit. Panels C and D show lamina propria and epithelial eosinophil 
numbers respectively at the baseline and post-treatment visits, in the placebo (blue square) 
and fevipiprant (orange circle) groups. Box and whisker plots show the median, 25th and 75th 
percentiles as a box, and the 10th and 90th percentiles as whiskers. P values refer to 
differences between the study groups with respect to change from the baseline visit to the 
post-treatment visit. 
 
Figure 3: Comparison of patient-reported and lung function outcome measures between 
the study groups 
Changes compared to the baseline visit are shown in the placebo (blue square) and 
fevipiprant (orange circle) groups with respect to Asthma Control Questionnaire score 
(ACQ7) in the Full Analysis Set (FAS, Panel A), ACQ7 in the subgroup with a baseline value 
≥ 1·5 (Panel B), standardised Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score (AQLQ(S), Panel 
C), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) performed before the administration of a 
  
26 
 
bronchodilator (Panel D), FEV1 performed after the administration of a bronchodilator (Panel 
E), and functional residual capacity (FRC, Panel F). P values refer to differences between the 
study groups with respect to change from the baseline visit. 
 
Figure 4: Comparison of epithelial damage outcome measures between the study groups 
Panel A shows a photomicrograph of a bronchial biopsy specimen demonstrating the 
appearance of intact epithelium (I), partially denuded epithelium (P) and denuded epithelium 
(D). Panels B-D show percentage of epithelium that is intact, percentage of epithelium that is 
denuded and thickness of intact epithelium respectively at the baseline and post-treatment 
visits, in the placebo (blue square) and fevipiprant (orange circle) groups. Error bars indicate 
the mean plus or minus the standard error of the mean. P values refer to differences between 
the study groups with respect to change from the baseline visit to the post-treatment visit.

28 
Subjects 
29 
Participants were older than 18 years of age and had a clinical diagnosis of asthma that was 
30 
supported by one or more of the following criteria: an increase in forced expiratory volume 
31 
(FEV1) of ≥ 12% and ≥ 200ml from its pre-bronchodilator value following the inhalation of 
32 
400μg salbutamol, a provoked fall in FEV1 of 20% by methacholine at ≤ 16mg/ml while on 
33 
inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), or a change in FEV1 of > 12% over two non-exacerbation-
34 
related measurements during the previous year. Inclusion criteria were current treatment with 
35 
ICS, a sputum eosinophil count of ≥ 2% at screening, and either an Asthma Control 
36 
Questionnaire (ACQ-7) score ≥ 1·5 at randomization or ≥ 1 exacerbations (requiring higher 
37 
than the patient’s normal dose of systemic corticosteroids for ≥ 3 days) in the past 12 months. 
38 
Exclusion criteria included serious coexisting illness, pregnancy or lactation, the possibility 
39 
of conception, a history of malignancy within the previous five years, recent (within 6 weeks 
40 
of screening) lower respiratory tract infection or exacerbation of asthma requiring oral 
41 
prednisolone, the use of omalizumab within 6 months before randomization into the study, 
42 
and the use of immunosuppressive medication (except low-dose [≤ 10mg prednisolone per 
43 
day] oral corticosteroids) within 30 days before randomization.  
44 
 
45 
Study visit protocol 
46 
At a screening visit (Visit 1, Day -21), demographic and clinical details were collected, and 
47 
inclusion and exclusion criteria were reviewed. An induced sputum sample was collected and 
48 
cell count was performed, in order to assess eligibility based upon a sputum eosinophil count 
49 
of ≥ 2%. Regular treatment was kept constant from this time point until the end of the study. 
50 
 3 
 
One week later, a two-week single-blind placebo run-in period was commenced (Visit 2, Day 
51 
-14). Following this, patients attended a baseline visit (Visit 3, Day 0), at which they 
52 
completed the ACQ-7 questionnaire, and eligibility based upon the inclusion and exclusion 
53 
criteria was again assessed, taking into account the ACQ-7 score. If patients fulfilled the 
54 
criteria, they proceeded to undertake the remainder of the study visit tests, and were then 
55 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either fevipiprant at a dose of 225 mg twice per day, or 
56 
an identical placebo. 
57 
 
58 
All tests performed at the baseline and post-treatment visits were carried out on the same day, 
59 
with the exception of bronchoscopy, which was performed on a separate day not more than 
60 
seven days following the other tests, but not on the day immediately following them, due to 
61 
the possibility of interaction between the sputum induction procedure and bronchial biopsies. 
62 
The time interval between the two testing days was kept constant for each patient between the 
63 
baseline and post-treatment visits. On the first testing day, patients completed the ACQ-7 and 
64 
Standardized Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ(S)). The fractional exhaled nitric 
65 
oxide at 50ml/s (FeNO50) was measured using a NIOX MINO device (Aerocrine AB, Solna, 
66 
Sweden). Patients undertook body plethysmography, measurement of carbon monoxide 
67 
diffusing capacity and pre-bronchodilator spirometry. An induced sputum sample was then 
68 
collected and cell count performed. Salbutamol (400 μg via a metered-dose inhaler and 
69 
spacer) was administered, followed by the measurement of post-bronchodilator spirometry. A 
70 
blood sample was drawn for the measurement of blood eosinophil count. Inspiratory and 
71 
expiratory computed tomography (CT) was then performed. On the second testing day, 
72 
bronchoscopy was performed. 
73 
 
74 
 4 
 
Six weeks following randomization, patients attended a mid-treatment visit (Visit 4, Day 42), 
75 
at which they completed the ACQ-7 and AQLQ(S) questionnaires, pre- and post-
76 
bronchodilator spirometry was performed, an induced sputum sample was obtained, and a 
77 
blood sample was drawn for the measurement of blood eosinophil count. Twelve weeks 
78 
following randomization, patients attended a post-treatment visit (Visit 5, Day 84), which 
79 
incorporated the same assessment schedule as the baseline visit. Patients then began a six-
80 
week single-blind placebo washout period. Following this, patients attended an end-of-study 
81 
visit (Visit 6, Day 126) and undertook the same assessments as at the baseline and post-
82 
treatment visits, except that bronchoscopy and CT scans were not performed. 
83 
 
84 
Safety was assessed at each study visit on the basis of patient-reported adverse events, 
85 
physical examination, vital signs, haematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis and an 
86 
electrocardiogram. 
87 
 
88 
Pulmonary function tests and sputum induction 
89 
Spirometry was performed using a rolling seal spirometer (Vitalograph, UK) according to 
90 
American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society (ATS / ERS) guidelines1, and 
91 
repeated twenty minutes after inhalation of 400μg salbutamol. Bronchial provocation testing 
92 
to methacholine was performed using the tidal breathing method as previously described2. 
93 
Methacholine was inhaled to a maximum concentration of 16mg/ml and the PC20 calculated 
94 
by linear interpolation of the log-transformed plot. The procedure was only performed in 
95 
those in whom no other objective evidence supporting the diagnosis was available. Body 
96 
plethysmography and carbon monoxide transfer factor were performed according to ATS / 
97 
ERS guidelines (Medisoft, Belgium)3,4. The fractional exhaled nitric oxide was measured 
98 
using a NIOX MINO device (Aerocrine AB, Solna, Sweden), as previously described5. 
99 
 5 
 
Sputum induction and processing was performed as previously described6. Differential cell 
100 
counts were recorded by a blinded individual and expressed as percentage values of a sample 
101 
containing at least 400 non-squamous cells.  
102 
 
103 
Skin tests for allergy 
104 
Skin prick tests for allergy were performed at Visit 2 to assess atopic status unless historical 
105 
positive results were available. Patients were tested against a panel of aeroallergens 
106 
comprising grass pollen, tree pollen [alder, silver birch, hazel], moulds [Aspergillus 
107 
fumigatus, Alternaria tenius, Cladosporium, Penicillium notatum], cat fur, dog dander, and 
108 
house dust mite [Dermatophagoides pteronyssimus. Small droplets of purified allergen 
109 
extracts were placed on the subject’s forearm, as well as a positive control (histamine) and 
110 
negative control (saline). A sterile lancet was passed through each droplet so as to break the 
111 
epidermis of the skin underneath the droplet without drawing blood. A new lancet was used 
112 
for each droplet, which was then immediately discarded. Surplus fluid was then blotted from 
113 
the skin. After 15 minutes the diameter of the wheal produced by each allergen was 
114 
measured. A wheal diameter of 3mm or more greater than that of the negative control was 
115 
considered to be a positive result. 
116 
 
117 
Bronchial biopsy analysis 
118 
All bronchoscopies were performed by blinded senior clinicians, in accordance with 
119 
published guidelines7. During bronchoscopy, subjects had up to six endobronchial biopsies. 
120 
Biopsy specimens were processed as previously described and embedded in glycol 
121 
methacrylate8.  
122 
 
123 
 6 
 
Two micrometre sections were cut and stained with Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) and 
124 
Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS). Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining was done with the 
125 
following mAbs: anti–mast cell tryptase clone AA1 (Dako UK, Ely, United Kingdom), anti-
126 
human smooth muscle actin (SMA) clone 1A4 (Dako UK, Ely, United Kingdom), anti-
127 
eosinophil major basic protein clone BMK-13 (Monosan, Uden, The Netherlands), anti-
128 
neutrophil elastase clone NP57 (Dako UK, Ely, United Kingdom), anti-CD3 polyclonal 
129 
antibody (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, California, USA), anti-endothelium clone EN4 
130 
(Monosan, Uden, The Netherlands) and anti-mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) clone 45M1 (Abcam, 
131 
Cambridge, UK). Appropriate isotype controls were used. 
132 
 
133 
For image analysis and morphometry ZEN 2012 image analysis software for light 
134 
microscopy (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany) was used. Tissue section areas were measured in 
135 
H&E and SMA stained sections. Total area, airway smooth muscle area and epithelial area 
136 
were measured directly, while lamina propria area was calculated by subtracting the all the 
137 
other areas and the area occupied by vessels and lymphatics from the total section area.  All 
138 
areas were expressed in mm2 and also as percentages of the total area. All morphometry 
139 
measurements and cellular counts were performed by one blinded observer on two non-
140 
contiguous tissue sections at least 20µm apart from the same biopsy block.  
141 
 
142 
Reticular basement membrane (RBM) thickness was measured at x200 magnification by 
143 
measuring 50 points 20µm apart according to the method validated by Sullivan et al9. 
144 
Epithelial thickness was measures using the method described by Cohen et al10. Briefly, areas 
145 
of intact and tangentially orientated epithelium were identified and measured. Subsequently, 
146 
to calculate the epithelial thickness, this area was divided by the lengths of the corresponding 
147 
RBM. Both RBM and epithelial thickness were expressed in µm. Vascularity was measured 
148 
 7 
 
using the Chalkley count, a surrogate of both vessel density and vascular area. As described 
149 
previously, a Chalkley eyepiece graticule (NG52 Chalkley Point Array, Pyser-SGI Ltd, 
150 
Edenbridge, UK) was used at x200 to measure Chalkley counts in four non-overlapping 
151 
vascular hotspots (1-2/section)11. The mean Chalkley count (MCC) was calculated as the 
152 
mean of the four measurements. Epithelial integrity was assessed by measuring the lengths of 
153 
intact epithelial denuded epithelium. These were expressed as percentage of all the RBM 
154 
length present in the section. For inflammatory cell counts, submucosal nucleated stained 
155 
inflammatory cells (eosinophils, mast cells and neutrophils) were counted on the 
156 
corresponding stained sections and expressed at cells/mm2 of lamina propria.  
157 
  
158 
Computed Tomography  
159 
Volumetric whole lung scans were obtained using a Siemens Sensation 16 scanner (16 x 0·75 
160 
mm collimation, 1·5 mm pitch, 120 kVp, 40 mAs, 0·5 seconds rotation time and scanning 
161 
field of view of 500 mm). The scans were obtained at full inspiration (near total lung 
162 
capacity) and at the end of expiration (near functional residual capacity). All subjects were 
163 
coached in the breath holding techniques, and practised breath holding, immediately prior to 
164 
scanning. All subjects were scanned within 60 minutes of receiving 400 micrograms of 
165 
salbutamol via a spacer. Images were reconstructed with a slice thickness of 0·75 mm at a 0·5 
166 
mm interval using B35f kernel. Post processing was performed on semi-automated software, 
167 
Apollo (VIDA Diagnostics, Iowa).   
168 
 
169 
QCT parameters obtained included; morphometry, measured in mm2, Lumen Area (LA), 
170 
Total Area (TA), Wall Area (WA) (𝑇𝐴 − 𝐿𝐴) and percentage Wall Area (%WA) 
171 
(100 𝑥 (
(𝑇𝐴−𝐿𝐴)
𝑇𝐴
)). Air-trapping measures were Mean Lung Density Expiratory to Inspiratory 
172 
 8 
 
ratio (MLDE/I) measured in Hounsfield Units (HU). Density at 15th percentile point (Perc15) 
173 
was measured in HU. All morphometry measures were corrected for Body Surface Area 
174 
mm2/m2 (BSA) (√ℎ𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 (𝑐𝑚)𝑥 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 (𝑘𝑔)
3600
). 
175 
 
176 
Supplementary results 
177 
We observed a significant negative correlation between the change in expiratory CT lung 
178 
volume and the change in post-bronchodilator FEV1, taking the fevipiprant and placebo 
179 
groups together (R = -0·317, p = 0·041), and this correlation was more pronounced with CT-
180 
derived lower lobe lung volume (R = -0·523, p = 0.0004) (Figure S2). Positive correlations 
181 
were also observed between changes in expiratory CT lung volume and changes in both 
182 
residual volume (RV) and the ratio of RV to total lung capacity (TLC) measured using body 
183 
plethysmography, but these correlations only reached statistical significance with CT-derived 
184 
lower lobe lung volumes (R = 0·374, p = 0·014 for RV; R = 0·361, p = 0·017 for RV/TLC).

Baseline and post-treatment values are mean (standard error), change from baseline to post-treatment is mean change (lower limit, upper limit of 95% 
confidence interval), and treatment difference is mean change in fevipiprant group minus mean change in placebo group (lower limit, upper limit of 95% 
confidence interval), unless otherwise stated. Post-treatment and changes from baseline to post-treatment are covariate-adjusted (least square mean) values. 
‡ Baseline values are geometric mean (% coefficient of variation), post-treatment values are geometric mean (lower limit, upper limit of 95% confidence 
interval), change from baseline to post-treatment is geometric mean fold-change (lower limit, upper limit of 95% confidence interval), and treatment 
difference is ratio of geometric mean fold-change in fevipiprant group to geometric mean fold-change in placebo group (lower limit, upper limit of 95% 
confidence interval). 
†N = 18 in fevipiprant group and N = 22 in placebo group.

MLD denotes mean lung density, HU Hounsfield unit, E/I expiratory/inspiratory, RB1 right upper lobe apical segmental bronchus, BSA body surface area, VI 
voxel index, CTLV computed tomography lung volume, P15 Hounsfield unit value below which 15% of voxel attenuation values fall, Pi10 wall area of a 
theoretical airway with an internal perimeter of 10mm, and Po20 percentage wall area of a theoretical airway with an external perimeter of 20mm. 
Baseline and post-treatment values are mean (standard error), change from baseline to post-treatment is mean change (lower limit, upper limit of 95% 
confidence interval), and treatment difference is mean change in fevipiprant group minus mean change in placebo group (lower limit, upper limit of 95% 
confidence interval).

changes in epithelial damage between the baseline and post-treatment visits  
Panels A and B show correlations between fold-change in sputum eosinophil count and 
change in intact or denuded epithelial percentage respectively. Panels C and D show 
correlations between fold-change in submucosal eosinophil count and change in intact or 
denuded epithelial percentage respectively. Participants in the placebo and fevipiprant groups 
are represented by blue squares and orange circles respectively, and best-fit linear regression 
lines are shown for the combined group. Spearman correlation coefficients (r) and associated 
P values are shown. 
 
Figure S2: Correlations between changes in computed tomography-derived lung 
volumes and changes in lung function outcomes between the baseline and post-
treatment visits 
Correlations are shown between changes in expiratory computed tomography-derived lung 
volumes (CTLVE) in the whole lung or specifically the lower lobes, and changes in post-
bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1, Panels A and B), functional 
residual capacity (FRC, Panels C and D), residual volume (RV, Panels E and F), and the ratio 
of residual volume to total lung capacity (RV/TLC, Panels G and H). Participants in the 
placebo and fevipiprant groups are represented by blue squares and orange circles 
respectively, and best-fit linear regression lines are shown for the combined group. Spearman 
correlation coefficients (r) and associated P values are shown.

Glossary of Terms
Assessment 
A procedure used to generate data required by the study 
Control drug 
A study drug used as a comparator to reduce assessment bias, 
preserve blinding of investigational drug, assess internal study 
validity, and/or evaluate comparative effects of the investigational 
drug 
Enrollment 
Point/time of patient entry into the study; the point at which 
informed consent must be obtained (i.e. prior to starting any of the 
procedures described in the protocol) 
Investigational drug 
The study drug whose properties are being tested in the study; this 
definition is consistent with US CFR 21 Section 312.3 and is 
synonymous with “investigational new drug.” 
Investigational treatment 
The investigational drug whose properties are being tested in the 
study as well as their associated placebo and active treatment 
controls.  This also includes approved drugs used outside of their 
indication/approved dosage, or that are tested in a fixed 
combination. 
Medication number 
A unique identifier on the label of each medication package in 
studies that dispense medication using an IVR system 
Patient number 
A number assigned to each patient who enrolls in the study. When 
combined with the center number, a unique identifier is created for 
each patient in the study. 
Stage

Protocol synopsis 
Title of study: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, study examining the effect of 
orally administered QAW039 on sputum eosinophil levels and other efficacy 
outcomes in patients with sputum eosinophilia and persistent asthma 
Purpose and rationale: The purpose of this study is to determine whether, in 
patients with sputum eosinophilia (≥ 2%) and persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma, 
12-weeks treatment with QAW039 at a dose of 225 mg b.i.d. (compared to placebo), 
on top of conventional treatment, reduces the levels of eosinophils in induced 
sputum. As well as providing comparative (against placebo) safety data from this 
population of patients, measurements made in this study will also be used to 
establish whether this treatment improves other measures of asthma disease activity, 
lung function and lung pathology. 
Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate a statistically 
significant reduction in sputum eosinophil levels in inadequately controlled, moderate-
to-severe asthmatics (GINA 2-5), with sputum eosinophilia after treatment with 
QAW039 for 12 weeks compared to placebo. 
The secondary objectives include: 
• To demonstrate that QAW039 provides significantly superior control of 
asthmatic symptoms as measured by the asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) 
compared to placebo. 
• To assess safety and tolerability of QAW039 in this moderate-to-severe 
asthmatic population as compared to placebo. 
Population: The study population will include male and female symptomatic patients 
with sputum eosinophilia and moderate-to-severe asthma (GINA 2-5) who are 
incompletely controlled on their current therapy. They will be chosen to investigate 
the efficacy of QAW039 as an add-on to their current therapy. Patients aged over 18 
years will be selected for the trial. A total of 60 patients (30 per treatment arm) will be 
randomized from a single center in the UK. 
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria: 
Inclusion criteria:  
• Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is 
performed. 
• Males and females of any race who are over the age of 18 years at the time 
informed consent is obtained. 
• Physician diagnosis of asthma, as per GINA guidelines GINA guidelines and 
currently prescribed ICS or ICS-LABA therapy.  
• Patients who are demonstrated to have reversible airway obstruction, 
significant FEV1 variability or airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), or who 
have shown such responses in previous test(s) within the last five years.

Study design: This study uses a 2-treatment arm (Placebo or QAW039), parallel-
group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design.  
After signing informed consent (Visit 1), patients will undergo a 2-week placebo run-in 
period during which their clinical stability and suitability for randomisation will be 
assessed. Asthma patients who are already receiving ICS or ICS-LABA therapy are 
the target population for this study. All patients will be allowed to continue on their 
current therapy. At the baseline visit (visit 3) all eligible patients will be randomized to 
QAW039 (225 mg b.i.d.) or placebo for a treatment duration of 12 weeks. At the end 
of the 12-week treatment period (visit 5), all patients will receive placebo until the 6-
week post-treatment assessment (visit 6). Both during the run-in and wash-out 
periods, the study will be single-blind because physicians will know that patients are 
on placebo, however the 12-week treatment period will be double-blind. 
Visits to assess safety and efficacy are scheduled at 6, 12, and 18 weeks post-
randomization. The assessment to address the primary objectives will be performed 
at the end of the treatment period (week 12).

Introduction 
1.1 
Background 
Many patients with asthma fail to achieve adequate control of symptoms and exacerbations 
when treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or combinations of ICS and long-acting beta-
agonists (LABA). Failure to respond to topical therapy may be due to multiple factors, 
including poor adherence, inadequate inhaler technique or corticosteroid resistance. 
Furthermore, there is evidence that some patients with asthma have prominent small airway 
disease that cannot be reached by standard inhalers. Such patients may require systemic (oral) 
therapy to control their airway inflammation. Current treatment options include the addition 
of a leukotriene modifier such as montelukast, but not all patients respond to this, and a 
significant proportion require step-up to long-term oral corticosteroids to achieve control, an 
unattractive option given the well-known side-effects of osteoporosis, muscle wasting and 
bruising. There is thus a need for effective oral anti-inflammatory therapies for asthma with 
greater efficacy than montelukast. 
QAW039 is a highly selective and potent antagonist of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) that binds to 
the CRTH2 (DP2) receptor, but not to the more general homeostatic PGD2 receptor, DP1. 
QAW039 is expected to work by binding CRTH2 receptors on eosinophils and CRTH2+ T 
lymphocytes in the blood, thus inhibiting the migration of eosinophils and CRTH2+ CD4+ 
lymphocytes into the airway tissues. Since these are major effector cells that drive the airway 
inflammation in asthma, the symptoms of the disease should be improved.  
The study has been focussed on sputum eosinophilia, as a primary endpoint, for a number of 
reasons. Firstly, the reduction of sputum eosinophilia will be further confirmation of the 
mechanism of action of this target in man and will provide comparative data against earlier 
studies with competitor compounds (Singh et al, 2009; Barnes et al, 2011). Secondly, the 
control of sputum eosinophilia has been shown to be an important measure in predicting the 
efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatments in asthma. Adults who had treatment adjusted to 
sputum eosinophils had a significantly reduced number of exacerbations compared with 
controls who did not. The comparative risk for exacerbations of standard care versus tailored 
care was 726 per 1000 versus 488 per 1000 (OR 0.36 [90% CI: 0.2 to 0.64]) (Petsky et al, 
2010; Petsky et al 2007; Chlumsky et al, 2006; Jayaram et al, 2006; Green et al, 2002). 
Finally, therapeutic reduction of sputum eosinophilia has been shown to significantly decrease 
hospitalisations due to asthma exacerbation and to have beneficial impact on the geometry of 
the respiratory tract (Haldar et al, 2009).  
Further information regarding QAW039 can be obtained from the Investigators’ Brochure.

2.1 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in

Investigational plan 
3.1 
Study design 
This study uses a 2-treatment arm (Placebo or QAW039), parallel-group, double-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled design.  
After signing informed consent (Visit 1), patients will undergo a 2-week placebo run-in period 
during which their clinical stability and suitability for randomisation will be assessed. Asthma 
patients who are already receiving ICS or ICS-LABA therapy are the target population for this 
study. All patients will be allowed to continue on their current therapy. At the baseline visit 
(visit 3) all eligible patients will be randomized to QAW039 (225 mg b.i.d.) or placebo for a 
treatment duration of 12 weeks. At the end of the 12-week treatment period (visit 5), all 
patients will receive placebo until the 6-week post-treatment assessment (visit 6). Both during 
the run-in and wash-out periods, the study will be single-blind because physicians will know 
that patients are on placebo, however the 12-week treatment period will be double-blind. 
Visits to assess safety and efficacy are scheduled at 6, 12, and 18 weeks post-randomization. 
The assessment to address the primary objectives will be performed at the end of the 
treatment period (week 12). An interim analysis will occur at Visit 5 in order to consider the 
need for possible re-sizing of the study and to allow early delivery of efficacy data to facilitate 
forward planning of the program.

3.2 
Rationale of study design 
The study is designed to explore the anti-inflammatory and disease-modifying potential of 
QAW039 in asthmatics in vivo. It will examine the effect of QAW039 on top of conventional 
background therapy in a group of persistent, uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe asthmatics with 
sputum eosinophilia. In order preserve trial integrity, this will be a parallel design study in 
which treatment is allocated in a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled manner. 
Placebo will be used in both active and placebo treatment groups during the run-in period in 
order to minimize the impact of “placebo-effect” on baseline fluctuations in patient reported 
outcomes prior to randomization. All patients will be allocated to placebo at visit 5 so that the 
knowledge that treatment has been withdrawn does not influence their assessment of their 
disease status. 
The rationale for studying this group of patients is supported by the findings from an interim 
analysis of our on-going study, CQAW039A2201, in mild-to-moderate asthmatics. In this 
analysis, we found that patients who either have the most pronounced baseline reduction in 
predicted FEV1 (<70%) and/or those who have pre-treatment, circulating eosinophilia (>300 
eosinophils per µL blood) appeared to benefit to the greatest extent from 4 weeks treatment 
with the CRTH2 antagonist, QAW039, either in terms of change in ACQ score or % change 
in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 or both.  
By enriching further still for these two characteristics – sputum eosinophilia and circulating 
eosinophilia both correlate with disease severity and aspect of lung function in asthma (Snell 
& Newbold, 2008) – and allowing further time for the therapeutic response to develop 
(section 3.3 below), we believe we will enhance the chance of measuring an enhanced 
therapeutic response and the possibility of observing fundamental changes in the underlying 
structure/function relationship in the asthmatic lung. 
3.3 
Rationale of dose/regimen, duration of treatment 
Data from a one month study with a CRTH2 antagonist showed a continuous increase in 
FEV1 over 4 weeks (Barnes et al, 2011). This observation is consistent with the mechanism of 
action, since CRTH2 antagonists, such as QAW039, should block inflammatory cells from 
entering the lung.  The duration of 12 weeks was chosen because it is not clear when maximal 
efficacy will be observed from this type of treatment and this is the longest time covered by 
current toxicology studies for QAW039. Furthermore, as observations are being made with 
regards to changes in lung histology and geometry, we wished to give the maximal time to 
allow the best signal of efficacy to develop.  
In CQAW039A2201, patients were dosed once daily for 4 weeks with 500 mg. At interim 
analysis when the first 63 patients had completed the study, no SAEs or deaths had occurred 
and the AEs observed did not significantly differ in their nature or severity between the 
active- and placebo-treated cohorts of patients.  
A twice daily dose of 225 mg (totaling 450 mg per day) will be included in this study and will 
be dummied with matching placebo in order to prevent bias. Using a population based PK 
model constructed using data from earlier studies (CQAW039A2101 and CQAW039A2102) 
the anticipated plasma AUCtau of 11.6 µg.h/mL [90% CI: 5.39-24.5] overlaps considerably

with the AUCtau modeled from a 500 mg daily dose (AUCtau 12.9 µg.h/mL [90% CI: 6.00 – 
27.1]).  
At steady state, the fluctuation index determined following 7 days of dosing in 
CQAW039A2102 was 315 % and 349 % following 100 mg q.d. and 300 mg q.d. dosing, is 
reduced to 135 % following 250 mg b.i.d. dosing reflecting the large peak to trough ratio 
following a q.d. regimen. The 450 mg will therefore be given in 2 equal doses (225 mg b.i.d., 
total of 8 capsules per day) to minimize the peak to trough ratio observed following q.d. 
dosing. In this way, we will maintain a higher minimum drug concentration compared to a 
once-daily regimen. The simulated concentration time profiles following 450 mg q.d. and 225 
b.i.d. are illustrated below.

represented by darker shades 
3.4 
Rationale for choice of comparator 
Placebo will be used to preserve trial integrity.  
As both placebo and QAW039 will be given in addition to the patients’ conventional (pre-
study) treatment there is no appropriate positive control that can be used in this situation given 
the range of disease severities to be included.

3.5 
Purpose and timing of interim analyses/design adaptations 
There will be an interim analysis of the data collected at Visit 5, once all patients have gone 
through this milestone.  
The purpose of this interim analysis is to consider the need for possible re-sizing of the study 
and to allow early delivery of efficacy data to facilitate forward planning of the program. 
3.6 
Risks and benefits 
The most significant preclinical findings have been an increase in heart rate in dogs and liver 
findings in mice (see exposure margins in investigator brochure). Neither of these events has 
been observed in other species. Both of these findings are readily monitored and have not 
been identified in the three healthy volunteer studies so far completed. Indeed, every 
indication from these studies suggests that QAW039 is safe and well tolerated. Our interim 
analysis of the first 63 mild-to-moderate, persistent asthmatic patients in the 
CQAW039A2201 study also showed no fatalities or serious adverse events and demonstrated 
no significant differences in the frequencies of adverse events between placebo and actively 
treated subjects. 
A potential risk we have identified of relevance to this study, given the likely frequency of 
statin co-medication in this group of patients (estimated to be around 25%), is the interaction 
of QAW039 with the drug transporter molecule, OATP1B1. QAW039 is capable of inhibiting 
the OATP drug transporters (OATP1B1: IC50 1.8 µM, OATP1B3: IC50 14 µM and 
OATP2B1: IC50 145 µM, respectively). Of the three, it is the interaction with OATP1B1 
which is of the highest potential importance because it has the lowest margin between the 
IC50 of transporter inhibition and the maximum unbound exposure.  The predicted maximal 
unbound concentration at steady-state following 450 mg q.d. dosing  is 0.363 µM  (90 %CI  
0.174, 0.786) based on a population based pharmacokinetic model using data from 
CQAW0392201, and a protein binding of 88.2 % (DMPK R0800735). The maximal unbound 
steady state concentration relative to the IC50 of OATP1B1 of 1.8 µM ranges from 2 to 10 
fold, with a median of 5 fold. This exceeds the 10-fold recommended margin which suggests 
the need for a DDI study (The International transporter Consortium, 2010). The potential risk 
will be mitigated by moving to a 225 mg b.i.d. dosing regimen when the margin to the IC50 
will increase in the range from 4 to 20 fold (median of 10 fold) where the need for a DDI 
study becomes a borderline requirement.  
As an additional precaution, only patients on low-to-medium statin doses (see section 5.1.2) 
will be allowed to take part in this study. Furthermore, exclusion of patients on statins with 
high baseline CK levels will take place and patients on statin medication who are included in 
the study will have regular monitoring for relevant symptoms and be subject to stopping 
criteria based on persistent myalgia and blood CK levels (Jacobson, 2008). 
Investigative bronchoscopy is considered to be safe in asthmatic subjects (Hattotuwa et al, 
2002) It is well tolerated even in those with severe asthma. Asthma exacerbations are rare and 
reduction in pulmonary function after the procedure is similar to that in subjects with less 
severe asthma (Moore et al, 2011). Professor Brightling’s group has undertaken in excess of 
300 research bronchoscopies at the Glenfield Hospital in Leicester in the last 8 years. Sore 
throat, small amounts of hemoptysis for 24-48h is commonly observed. One of his patients

was admitted over night following bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for observation but no 
treatment was required. BAL will not be performed in CQAW039A2208. None of his subjects 
have had a pneumothorax and they have had no deaths. The use of sedation and local 
anesthetics will be closely controlled and patients will be pre-medicated with bronchodilator 
and will be continuously monitored throughout the procedure. The procedure is therefore 
considered low risk. 
The HRCT scan will expose the patients to a higher dose of radiation than they would 
normally be exposed to, and this may cause a very small increase in the risk of developing 
cancer. Careful radiation logs will be maintained to allow for margins to the 5 mSv over 3 
years exposure limits. Although both inspiratory and expiratory scans are planned, the actual 
numbers of scans performed (with expiratory scans taking priority) will be determined in 
order to maintain an acceptable margin. 
Low radiation dose HRCT scans will be performed for the purpose of this study. Each HRCT 
scan will be equivalent to approximately eight months’ natural radiation exposure in the UK. 
We will closely monitor the radiation dose due to HRCT scans during the course of the study 
and the upper limit of radiation exposure will be equivalent to two years’ natural radiation 
exposure in the UK.  
The natural risk of fatal cancer in the UK population is about 1 in 4. We estimate that the 
amount of additional radiation exposure in this study will increase this risk slightly to 1 in 
3.994 (Health Protection Agency, 2011). 
Given that there is (a) preliminary data for QAW039 and published evidence from a 
competitor compound suggesting that CRTh2 antagonism is efficacious in asthmatic subjects 
(Barnes et al, 2011), (b) that patients with pre-existing heart and/or liver disease will be 
excluded (c) that cardiac and hepatic function will be monitored and (d) that the potential risk 
of statin co-administration is being managed by both CK-based exclusion criteria, lowering 
the QAW039 Cmax levels through  b.i.d. dosing, and restrictions on the statin medication 
dose levels in recruited patients and relevant stopping criteria, Novartis consider both that the 
risks to these patients are modest and the benefit-risk ratio for the patients participating in this 
study is acceptable.

Population 
The study population will include male and female symptomatic patients with sputum 
eosinophilia and moderate-to-severe asthma (GINA 2-5) who are incompletely controlled on 
their current therapy. They will be chosen to investigate the efficacy of QAW039 as an add-on 
to their current therapy. Patients aged over 18 years will be selected for the trial. A total of 60 
patients (30 per treatment arm) will be randomized from a single center in the UK.

Additional study treatment 
No additional treatment beyond investigational treatment is requested for this trial. 
5.1.3 
Treatment arms 
Patients will be assigned to one of the following two treatment arms in a ratio of 1:1. 
• Arm 1: QAW039 225mg (1 capsule of QAW039 150 mg and 3 capsules of QAW039 
25mg) 
• Arm 2: Placebo (1 capsule of Placebo for QAW039 150mg and 3 capsules of Placebo for 
QAW039 25mg) 
Patients will be stratified into two cohorts based on use/not use of Oral Corticosteroids. 
5.1.4 
Treatment assignment 
Randomization numbers will be assigned in ascending, sequential order to eligible patients in 
accordance with entry into the study. The randomization numbers will be generated using the 
following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from 
patients and investigator staff. Treatment Allocation Cards will be produced by or under the 
responsibility of Novartis Drug Supply Management using a validated system that automates 
the random assignment of treatment arms to randomization numbers in the specified ratio. The 
randomization scheme for patients will be reviewed and approved by a member of the 
Biostatistics Quality Assurance Group. 
5.1.5 
Treatment blinding 
This is a double-blind study in which medication will be supplied in a single blind fashion 
utilizing an un-blinded pharmacist. Patients and Investigator will remain blinded to the 
treatment allocation during double blind treatment period. During run-in and washout period 
only patients will remain blinded. The active drug (QAW039) will be supplied in blister packs 
of two strengths 25mg and 150mg. The Placebo capsules are of identical appearance and will 
be identically packed.

Dispensing the study treatment 
Study site will be supplied by Novartis with study drug organized in blinded medication kits. 
Study medication kits comprise cartons containing blisters of Hard Gelatin Capsules (HGCs) 
of QAW039 25mg, QAW039 150mg and Placebo to QAW039. Each patient will receive one 
kit at each dispensing visit. At Visits 2 and 5, all kits dispensed will contain placebo. In order 
to maintain the blind from the patient’s point of view, investigators should not divulge 
information regarding the fact that all individuals will be assigned to placebo during the 
run-in and wash-out phase of the study. 
Study medication kits dispensed to all subjects at Visit 2 will contain the following 
medication: 
1. 1 folding carton containing 5 blisters of 7 HGCs of Placebo for QAW039 150mg (Blue 
label) 
2. 1 folding carton containing 13 blisters of 7 HGCs of Placebo for QAW039 25mg (White 
label) 
Study medication kits dispensed to subjects randomized to get Active treatment at Visit 3 and 
4 will contain the following medication: 
1. 3 folding cartons each containing 5 blisters of 7 HGCs of QAW039 150mg (Blue label) 
2. 3 folding cartons each containing 13 blisters of 7 HGCs of QAW039 25mg (White label) 
Study medication kits dispensed to subjects randomized to get Placebo treatment at Visit 3 
and 4 will contain the following medication: 
1. 3 folding cartons each containing 5 blisters of 7 HGCs of Placebo for QAW039 150mg 
(Blue label) 
2. 3 folding cartons each containing 13 blisters of 7 HGCs of Placebo for QAW039 25mg 
(White label) 
Study medication kits dispensed to all subjects at Visit 5 will contain the following 
medication: 
1. 3 folding cartons each containing 5 blisters of 7 HGCs of Placebo for QAW039 150mg 
(Blue label) 
2. 3 folding cartons each containing 13 blisters of 7 HGCs of Placebo for QAW039 25mg 
(White label) 
All the carton and blister labels will be double-blinded. All the kits have a 2-part single-
blinded label. Immediately before dispensing a kit, the un-blinded investigator staff (un-
blinded pharmacist) will detach the tear-off part of the label from the packaging and affix it to 
the source document for that patient’s unique patient number.  
The un-blinded pharmacist will have to write patient # / randomization # and visit # on kit 
label, box labels as well as blister labels before dispensing the medication kit.  
Capsules should only be removed from the blister immediately before dosing. 
All blister packs and outer kit cartons must be returned to the site at each of the 
following Visits 3, 4, 5 and 6 (or the final visit for patients who withdraw from the study 
prematurely).

Supply, storage and tracking of study treatment 
Study treatment must be received by a designated person (un-blinded pharmacist) at the study 
site, handled and stored safely and properly, and kept in a secured location to which only the 
designated persons have access. Upon receipt, all study drugs should be stored according to 
the instructions specified on the drug labels. Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in 
accordance with the protocol. 
Medication labels will be in English language and comply with the UK legal requirements. 
They will include storage conditions for the drug, but no information about the patient except 
for the medication number. 
The investigator must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of study 
drug in a drug accountability ledger. Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by 
an unblinded monitor during site visits and at the completion of the trial. Patients will be 
asked to return all remaining unused study drug and packaging at the end of the study or at the 
time of study drug discontinuation. 
At the conclusion of the study, and as appropriate during the course of the study, the 
investigator will return all used and unused study drug, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of 
the completed drug accountability ledger to the Novartis monitor or designee or to the 
Novartis address provided in the investigator folder at the site. 
No study medication should be destroyed until completion of the final clinical study report 
and notification is received from the Clinical Trial Head. 
5.2.4 
Instructions for prescribing and taking study treatment 
QAW039 and matching placebo will be provided as oral capsules, equally matched in size, 
shape and color. 
Medication labels will comply with the UK legal requirements and be printed in English 
language. They will supply no information about the patient. The storage conditions for study 
drug will be described on the medication label. 
Patients will be instructed to come to the clinic in time to complete pre-dosing assessments 
and to allow QAW039/placebo study medication to be taken in the morning between 08:00 
and 11:00 am. Patients must be instructed to withhold the use of short acting β2-agonists 
(rescue medication) for at least 6 hours prior to all clinic visits, unless the use is absolutely 
necessary. 
On non-visit days, patients will be instructed to take all four capsules in the morning between 
08:00 and 11:00 from their QAW039/placebo medication kits. 
On all days, patients should take their four evening capsules of QAW039/placebo 
approximately 12 hours after their AM dose +/- 30 minutes. 
The investigator should instruct the patient to take the study drug exactly as prescribed and by 
stating that adherence is necessary for the patient’s safety and the validity of the study. The 
patient should be instructed to contact the investigator if he/she is unable for any reason to 
take the study drug as prescribed.

All used and unused blister kits must be returned by the patient at Visits 3, 4, 5 and 6 (or their 
final visit for patients who withdraw from the study prematurely). 
The date and time of dose administration at each clinic visit (Visits 2-6) will be recorded on 
the Dosage Administration Record CRF. 
5.2.5 
Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study treatment 
No adjustments to the study drug dosage or schedule is permitted throughout the trial. 
5.2.6 
Rescue medication 
Patients should be instructed to abstain from taking rescue medication (e.g. such as 
salbutamol or albuterol) within 6 hours of the start of each visit unless absolutely necessary. 
If rescue medication is taken within 6 hours prior to spirometry or prior to administering study 
medication at Visit 3 onward (if needed), the visit should be rescheduled to the next possible 
day. The investigator must use their judgment when deciding how many times a visit for an 
individual patient should be rescheduled. 
In the event that a patient uses a dose of rescue medication after taking study medication at 
that visit or during any other visits then the visit should continue as planned but the number of 
puffs of rescue medication and the approximate time taken will be captured in the patient’s 
CRF.  
5.2.7 
Background therapy 
All patients should keep their background therapy doses unchanged during the course of the 
study. If their background medication needs to be altered, patients should be discontinued 
from the study. Patients may vary the dose of their rescue medication as necessary. 
5.2.8 
Concomitant treatment 
The investigator should instruct the patient to notify the study site about any new medications 
he/she takes after the start of the study drug. All medications and significant non-drug 
therapies (including physical therapy and blood transfusions) administered after the patient 
starts study must be listed on the Concomitant medications/Significant non-drug therapies of 
study CRF. 
5.2.9 
Prohibited treatment 
The medications in Table 5-2 are only permitted under the circumstances given. Each 
concomitant drug must be individually assessed against all exclusion criteria and the table

for adherence to this table and also all other inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
5.3 
Discontinuation of study treatment and premature patient 
withdrawal 
Patients may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. They may be 
considered withdrawn if they state an intention to withdraw, fail to return for visits, or become 
lost to follow-up for any other reason. 
If premature withdrawal occurs for any reason, the investigator must make every effort to 
determine the primary reason for a patient’s premature withdrawal from the study and record 
this information on the Study Completion CRF. 
Study treatment must be discontinued and the patient withdrawn from the trial under the 
following circumstances: 
• Withdrawal of informed consent 
• Asthma exacerbation 
• Adverse events for which continued exposure to the study drug would be detrimental 
• Heart rate of >100 b.p.m. measured on 2 occasions, approximately 10 minutes apart, with 
the patient at rest 
• Abnormal laboratory results violate liver function rules: 
a. ALT or AST ≥ 5xULN or 
b. ALT or AST ≥ 2.5xULN and total bilirubin ≥ 1.5xULN 
• Pregnancy 
• If the patient has had excessive use of rescue medication the investigator should asses 
whether it is safe for the patient to continue in the study: specifically, an increase in β2-
agonist rescue medication use on at least 2 of any 3 consecutive days exceeding the 
equivalent of 8 puffs/day salbutamol/albuterol MDI.

for greater than 3 days accompanied by increase in CK levels > 10 X ULN or persistent 
intolerable muscle pain regardless of the accompanying CK level. 
• Unblinding of the study treatment for any reason 
Protocol deviations should not lead to patient withdrawal unless they indicate a significant 
risk to the patient’s safety. 
If premature withdrawal occurs for any reason, the patient should return to the clinic as soon 
as possible for a Premature Subject Withdrawal (PSW) visit. The investigator must make 
every effort to determine the primary reason for a patient’s premature withdrawal from the 
study and record this information on the End of Treatment CRF. 
In addition to these requirements for study drug discontinuation, the investigator should 
discontinue study drug for a given patient if, on balance, he/she believes that continuation 
would be detrimental to the patient’s well-being.

show "due diligence" by documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact the 
patient, e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. 
Patients who are prematurely withdrawn from the study will not be replaced by an equal 
number of newly enrolled patients. 
5.4 
 Asthma exacerbations 
An asthma exacerbation is defined as a worsening of asthma as judged clinically significant 
by the physician, requiring treatment with rescue oral or IV corticosteroids for 3 days or more. 
The initiation of or the increase in systemic corticosteroid marks the start of an asthma 
exacerbation episode and cessation of the increase in systemic corticosteroids regimen will 
mark the end of an exacerbation episode. 
Patients who are deemed to have had an exacerbation should either not be enrolled into this 
study (if the exacerbation is in the run-up to randomization) or should be withdrawn from this 
study if the exacerbation occurs during the treatment or washout periods of the study.  
Patients who have had an exacerbation during the run-in period may be screened for study 
entry again at a later stage once a minimum of 6 weeks following recovery has elapsed. 
5.5 
Emergency unblinding of treatment assignment 
Emergency unblinding should only be undertaken when it is essential to treat the patient 
safely and efficaciously. Most often, study drug discontinuation and knowledge of the 
possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study patient who presents with an 
emergency condition. Two sets of emergency code cards are provided to the Novartis Pharma 
Organization. One set is to be retained by the country Pharma Organization and one set is to 
be distributed to the investigators. All code break cards must be retained until the end of the 
study and returned to Novartis. They must be stored in a secured place but must be accessible 
in case of an emergency. The investigator will receive a masked code break card for each 
patient, with details of the drug treatment covered by a removable, scratch-off cover. In an 
emergency, the scratch-off cover can be removed to determine the treatment. The scratch-off 
covers are not to be removed for any reason except other than an emergency. When the 
investigator removes a scratch-off cover he/she must note the date, time and reason for 
removing it and retain this information with the patient case report form documentation. The 
unmasking treatment code should not be recorded in the patient`s CRF. The investigator must 
also immediately inform the Novartis local monitor or designee that the code has been broken. 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a procedure in place to allow access 
to the code break cards in case of emergency. The investigator will inform the patient how to 
contact his/her backup in cases of emergency when he/she is unavailable. The investigator 
will provide protocol number, study drug name if available, patient number, and instructions 
for contacting the local Novartis CPO (or any entity to which it has delegated responsibility 
for emergency code breaks) to the patient in case emergency unmasking is required at a time 
when the investigator and backup are unavailable. 
Study drug must be discontinued after emergency unmasking. Study drug must also be 
discontinued for any patient whose treatment code has been inadvertently broken or for any 
non-emergency reason.

5.6 
Study completion and post-study treatment 
Study completion for a patient will occur after he/she has completed 20 weeks of treatment 
(through to Visit 6) or they have prematurely withdrawn. Completion of the study will be 
when all randomized patients have completed 20 weeks of treatment. 
Patients completing the treatment period will not be given further access to study drug 
because the risk/benefit ratio will not yet have been substantiated and there are already other 
marketed therapeutic alternatives available to treat these patients. At the time of study 
completion or early termination, all patients will be placed on the appropriate asthma 
treatment as prescribed by the investigator. 
The investigator must provide follow-up medical care for all patients who are prematurely 
withdrawn from the study, or must refer them for appropriate ongoing care. 
5.7 
Early study termination 
The study can be terminated at any time for any reason by Novartis. Should this be necessary, 
the patient should be seen as soon as possible and treated as described in Section 6 for a 
prematurely withdrawn patient. The investigator may be informed of additional procedures to 
be followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the 
patient’s interests. The investigator will be responsible for informing the ECs of the early 
termination of the trial.

week later 
10 = Patients with historical positive skin prick tests need not repeat them at this visit 
a = These assessments will take an average of three separate clinic days to perform. The tests are 
grouped into study days A, B and C (see below). Therefore, they will be spread over a period of at 
most one week that includes the nominal visit date above. The bronchoscopy needs to be performed 
last as there maybe carryover effects for a couple of days on airway inflammation, in particular. Due to 
potential interference between assessments, induced sputum analysis and bronchoscopy cannot be 
performed on consecutive days, but the (A) and (B) study day groupings can be interchanged 
providing there is still a day between sputum and bronchoscopy.

b = Subject’s individual levels of radiation exposure will be monitored during the course of the study. 
The maximum allowed radiation dose from research studies will be 5mSv over the course of this and 
all other previous research studies in the previous three years. Patients who are likely to exceed this 
dose will not have further CT scans. If some but not all scans can be performed due to radiation dose 
constraints in a particular patient, priority will be given to expiratory CT scans.

6.3 
Treatment exposure and compliance 
Study drug compliance will be assessed by the investigator and/or center personnel at 
designated visits by recording capsule counts from the previously dispensed blister strips. 
The total number of doses of study drug administered since the last dispensing visit will be 
recorded in the CRFs at Visits 3, 4, 5 and 6 for each patient on the CRF. For patients who 
discontinued during the study this will be recorded at the discontinuation visit. 
All doses of study drug taken at the clinic visits should be from the newly assigned 
medication packs. Returned study drug should not be used for dosing. 
6.4 
Efficacy 
As this is a single center study, central reading centers will not be required. 
6.4.1 
Sputum cell analysis 
Sputum will be induced and assessed for differential cellular content (absolute numbers and 
percentages) as previously described (Pavord et al, 1997). Sputum induction will be 
performed through the inhalation of hypertonic saline. All subjects will have a baseline FEV1 
measured and the procedure stopped if: 
a. The subject’s FEV1 drops by greater than 20% of the post-salbutamol FEV1 baseline 
value 
b. The subjects feels any discomfort and does not want to continue with the saline inhalation 
procedure 
c. The investigator feels it is unsafe to continue with the saline inhalation 
6.4.2 
Spirometry 
All clinic visits for spirometry will occur in the morning.  
Equipment for spirometry assessments will be provided locally and all measurements will be 
reviewed by trained spirometry technicians or appropriate physicians. Refer to Appendix 3 
Spirometry Guidance, for further details on spirometry testing. 
6.4.3 
Impulse Oscillometry 
Impulse oscillometry (IOS) is performed using a commercially-available system, Jaeger 
MasterScreen Impulse Oscillometry System, according to standard guidelines. This is 
calibrated daily using a 3-litre syringe and a standard 0.2 kPaL-1s-1 calibration mesh. 
Participants wear a nose clip and audible pulses of sound containing a range of frequencies 
from 5-20 Hz are delivered to their airways by means of a mouthpiece while they breathe 
normally. Patients are asked to support their cheeks during the test in order to avoid 
dissipation of the impulses in the mouth. Measures of the frequency-dependence of resistance 
and reactance, designated R5-R20 (resistance at 5 Hz minus resistance at 20 Hz) and AX 
(reactance area) respectively, are calculated by the IOS software.

6.4.4 
High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) 
All images will be acquired with spirometric gating. Before CT scanning, supine spirometry 
will be performed to obtain supine lung volume measurements (slow vital capacity [SVC], 
inspiratory capacity and expiratory reserve volume). Inspiratory and expiratory CT scans at 
pre-determined SVC (e.g. 80% and 20% SVC) will be obtained. Expiratory scans allow 
quantitative analysis of air trapping and emphysema, while inspiratory scans allow the 
quantification of bronchial wall thickening 
6.4.5 
Multiple Breath Washout (MBW) 
MBW is performed using a modified Innocor gas analyser. Participants wear a nose clip and 
breathe a known concentration (0.2%) of an inert and non-absorbed gas, sulphur hexafluoride 
(SF6), via a mouthpiece connected to the Innocor device, until the concentration in their 
exhaled breath reaches a steady state (the wash-in phase). Participants are then switched to 
breathing room air and encouraged to maintain a steady respiratory frequency of 12 breaths 
per minute and a tidal volume of approximately 1 litre, making use of a real-time display of 
these parameters. The concentration of SF6 in exhaled breath is recorded during this ‘wash-
out’ phase until it reaches 1/40 of the original concentration (0.005%). A number of 
parameters are derived from the raw MBW data using custom software, including Scond and 
Sacin. Scond is thought to represent ventilation inhomogeneity arising from conductive 
airway disease, while Sacin represents ventilation inhomogeneity arising from acinar airspace 
disease. 
6.4.6 
Hyperpolarized Helium-3 MRI Imaging (He-3 MRI) 
6.4.6.1 
3He Hyperpolarization 
3He will be hyperpolarized on site in Sheffield with regulatory approved (UK-MAIMP-
29724) equipment and administered through a Tedlar bag. 3He will be delivered in 300-400 
ml doses according to total lung capacity made up to one liter with 600-700 ml nitrogen.  
6.4.6.1.1 3He MRI 
Patients will be placed inside a custom 3He body coil inside the 1.5T magnet and the 
following 3He MRI pulse sequences will be acquired with sensitivity to: (i) static breathold 
ventilation heterogeneity, (ii) Apparent Diffusion Coefficient mapping and (iii) dynamic gas 
flow and washout.  
a. A low flip angle 3D gradient echo sequence will be used to image ventilation distribution. 
Images will be acquired during a 13 second breath hold following inhalation of the gas 
from FRC. This exam will be performed twice in the first session as a means of 
assessment of baseline repeatability of ventilated volume.  
b. ADC images will be acquired with simultaneous ventilation images for spatial registration 
to the ventilation images described above. ADC images will be processed and the results 
will also be presented as spatial ADC maps for comparison with HRCT and in histogram 
format. 
c. 3D dynamic images of gas inflow and washout will be acquired with a time resolved 
sequence and the washout time constants will be derived for comparison with MBW.

A dedicated Research Radiographer will be present at all times to perform the scans alongside 
the Research MRI physicist. 
6.4.7 
Bronchial Biopsies and Brushings 
Patients are placed into the supine or semi-recumbent position and venous access is inserted. 
The patient receives premedication (e.g. midazolam 0.07 mg/kg). Oxygen levels are 
monitored and oxygen supplementation is provided. The throat and larynx area is 
anaesthetized with a local anesthetic spray (lidocaine, max dose 20 puffs = 3mg/kg) and a 
flexible endoscope is introduced. After initial orientation and documentation of appearance of 
the airways, brushings and endobronchial biopsies will be taken from the right main bronchus 
and segmental and sub-segmental bronchi. The brushes are cut off and transferred into a 15 ml 
V-tube (polypropylene) containing 2 ml RNA protect reagent or culture medium. The 
bronchial biopsies will be placed in normal saline, PFA (paraformaldehyde) or PMSF 
(phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride) as appropriate.  After the procedure patients will remain 
under medical supervision for 2 hours. 
6.4.8 
Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) 
In this study, the ACQ will be used to assess improvements in asthma symptom control. The 
ACQ was originally validated in patients with asthma aged 17 to 90 years (Juniper 1999, 
2005), and is one of several asthma control measures recommended by GINA Guidelines. The 
ACQ consists of 7 items: 5 items on symptom assessment, 1 item on rescue bronchodilator 
use, and 1 item on airway caliber (FEV1 % predicted). The ACQ has been fully validated, 
including a minimal important difference (MID) or smallest change that can be considered 
clinically important (0.5). The ACQ will be self-administered at the clinic (questions 1-6 
only) and it only takes a few minutes to complete. Patients are asked how they have been 
feeling during the past week and to score each item on a 7-point response scale, where 0 
indicates ‘totally controlled’ and 6 indicates ‘severely uncontrolled.’ Study staff score 
question 7 based on % predicted FEV1 (ideally pre-bronchodilator). The total score is 
calculated as the mean of all questions. The questionnaire should always be completed before 
any other assessments.  
A SAMPLE of the Asthma Control Questionnaire is included in Appendix 4. 
6.4.9 
Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire – Standardized (AQLQs) 
In this study, the disease-specific, standardized version of the asthma quality of life 
questionnaire (AQLQs) will be used to measure health-related quality of life in trial patients. 
The measure was originally validated for use in patients with asthma aged 17 to 70 years 
(Juniper et al, 1999). The AQLQs is a 32-item questionnaire designed to measure functional 
impairments that are most important to patients with asthma. It consists of 4 domains: 
symptoms, emotional function, environmental stimuli and activity limitation. Full validation 
has been demonstrated, including a minimal important difference (MID) or smallest change

that can be considered clinically important (0.5). The AQLQs will be self-administered at the 
clinic and takes about 4 to 5 minutes to complete. Given that the AQLQs will be administered 
along with the ACQ, which has a 1-week recall, patients completing the AQLQs will also be 
asked to recall their experiences during the past week, and to score each item on a 7- point 
scale (7 = not at all impaired to 1 = severely impaired). The AQLQs yields domain-specific 
scores and a total score, which is the mean response to all 32 questions. The questionnaire 
should always be completed before any other non-PRO assessments.  
A SAMPLE of the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire is included in Appendix 5. 
6.4.10 
Volatile Organic Compounds 
Testing is performed using bespoke equipment loaned from Loughborough University. 
Subjects are asked to refrain from applying cosmetics on the day of the test. Subjects wear a 
tight-fitting mask supplied with air and with a sample tube attached, and breathe normally 
until 2.5 L of exhaled breath are collected through the sample tube. Sample tubes are sent to 
Loughborough University for analysis (Ibrahim et al, 2011). 
6.4.11 
Fraction of Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO50) 
Exhaled Nitric Oxide is widely accepted as a non-invasive marker for airway inflammation. 
Fractional exhaled nitric oxide will be measured following the recently published guidelines 
on standardized techniques including calibration of equipment as appropriate for measuring 
exhaled Nitric Oxide by ATS and ERS (ATS/ERS guidelines 2005). 
To ensure consistency in the measurement of FeNO, all sites will be provided with a NIOX 
MINO FeNO machine. 
Recommendations for FeNO Measurements 
FeNO measurements should be performed PRIOR to spirometry assessments, as spirometric 
manoeuvres have been shown to transiently reduce exhaled NO levels. 
FeNO measurements have to be performed at the same time of day (preferably within 4 hours 
of rising). 
Repeated, reproducible exhalations should be performed to obtain two measurements within 
10% of each other. Exhaled NO is the mean of these two values. The duration of exhalation 
must be sufficient (up to 10 seconds) to achieve a stable NO plateau. 
Allow subjects at least 30 seconds of relaxed tidal breathing to rest between repeated 
exhalations in order not to exhaust the patient. 
The patient should be seated comfortably with the equipment at the proper height and 
position. 
Patients should refrain from eating and drinking at least 2 hours before measurements. 
Patients should avoid strenuous exercise for 1 hour before measurements. 
The time of last bronchodilator should be noted, as FeNO levels may vary with the degree of 
airway obstruction or after bronchodilation.

Clinical Trial Protocol 
 
Protocol No. CQAW039A2208 
 
Respiratory tract infections may lead to increased levels of exhaled NO in asthma, therefore 
the infection should be recorded in the patient’s medical file (and as an AE in the CRF). 
Breath-hold results in NO accumulation which causes NO peaks in the exhalations profiles of 
NO versus time and should therefore be discouraged. 
6.4.12 
Appropriateness of efficacy assessments 
The spirometry, patient reported outcome measures, sputum assessments and exhaled NO 
measurements are typical of a study of this type. The other, more exploratory measures, of 
lung histology, pulmonary function and imaging as well as systemic protein and mRNA 
measurements are part of attempt to gain a holistic understanding of how the immunology, 
genetics and pathology impact upon lung function and, ultimately, on patient symptomatology 
and disease progression in asthma.  
We are collaborating with the AIRPROM initiative, through Professors Brightling & Wild, 
which is attempting to build an in silico model of asthma to better predict how insults and 
therapies might impact the course of patients’ disease. 
6.5 
Safety 
The following safety assessments will be performed: 
• History and physical examination 
• Vital signs 
• Hematology 
• Blood chemistry including but not limited to Liver function tests: ALT (SGOT), AST 
(SGPT), total bilirubin, Metabolic panel: glucose, creatinine, urea (BUN), Na, K, Ca, Cl, 
Mg, triglycerides, lipase, cholesterol, albumin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, γ-GT, 
uric acid, total bilirubin, CK and Immunoglobulins 
• Urinalysis by dipstick. If dipstick is positive, then a microscopic examination should be 
performed. 
• CK-MB, Troponin I (in response to CK results outside of the normal range) 
• HbA1c (collected at screening only) 
• Pregnancy test (females of childbearing potential) 
• ECG  
• Adverse events including serious adverse events 
ECG will be analyzed locally and laboratory assessments (excluding histology and sputum 
analysis) will be performed externally. 
6.5.1 
Physical examination 
A complete physical examination will include the examination of general appearance, skin, 
neck (including thyroid), eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, 
extremities, vascular and neurological. If indicated based on medical history and/or 
symptoms, rectal, external genitalia, breast, and pelvic exams will be performed

Information for all physical examinations must be included in the source documentation at the 
study site. Significant findings that are present prior to informed consent being granted must 
be included in the Relevant Medical History/Current Medical Conditions screen on the 
patient’s CRF. Significant findings made after informed consent is given which meet the 
definition of an Adverse Event must be recorded on the Adverse Event screen of the patient’s 
CRF. 
6.5.2 
Vital Signs 
Vital signs include body temperature, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
and pulse measurements. After the patient has been sitting for five minutes, with back 
supported and both feet placed on the floor, systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be 
measured. Patient’s condition must be monitored to rule out any clinically relevant arrhythmia 
or tachycardia. 
Clinically notable vital signs are defined in Appendix 1. 
6.5.3 
Height and Weight 
Height in centimeters (cm) and body weight (to the nearest 0.1 kilogram [kg] in indoor 
clothing, but without shoes) will be measured. 
6.5.4 
Laboratory Evaluations 
A central laboratory will be used for analysis of all specimens collected. Details on the 
collections, shipment of samples and reporting of results by the central laboratory are 
provided to investigators in the laboratory manual. 
Clinically notable laboratory findings are defined in Appendix 1. 
6.5.4.1 
Hematology 
Hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count with differential, and 
platelet count will be measured. 
6.5.4.2 
Clinical chemistry 
Albumin, alkaline phosphatase, AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), bilirubin, calcium, chloride, 
cholesterol, CK, creatinine, γ-GT, glucose, LDH, magnesium, phosphate, potassium, sodium, 
triglycerides, urea (BUN), uric acid and immunoglobulins (IgG and possibly including but not 
limited to IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4) will be measured. 
Patients exhibiting liver function test values of 
• ALT or AST ≥ 5xULN or 
• ALT or AST ≥ 2.5xULN and total bilirubin ≥ 1.5xULN  
at any visit should be withdrawn from the trial. 
If the total bilirubin concentration is increased above 1.5 times the upper limit of normal 
range, total bilirubin should be differentiated into the direct and indirect reacting bilirubin. All 
patients with laboratory tests containing clinically significant abnormalities should be 
followed regularly until the values return to within the normal ranges or until a valid reason

other than drug-related adverse experiences is identified, even after the study medication has 
discontinued. 
6.5.4.3 
Urinalysis 
Dipstick measurements for specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose and blood will be performed. 
If the urine dipstick is abnormal, the sample will be sent to central laboratory for additional 
testing, including assessment of WBC and RBC sediments. 
6.5.5 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
Standard 12-lead ECGs will be acquired. A paper tracing must be obtained for immediate 
safety assessment and subsequently archived at the site. ECGs should contain the subject 
number, randomization number, the date and time of the tracing and the study code 
"QAW039A2206". The paper tracings must be signed and dated by the investigator or another 
physician at the clinical site. Interpretation of ECGs will be performed by the investigator or 
another physician at the clinical site. 
ECGs must be acquired only after subjects have been quietly at rest in the sitting position for 
at least 10 minutes. During ECG acquisition, subjects must be perfectly still and not speak. 
When the ECG acquisition time coincides with vital signs and blood draws, the ECG must be 
acquired first, followed by vital signs and the blood draws. 
ECGs should be free of baseline wander and noise. Prior to acquisition, the ECG operator 
should check the tracing to ensure that it is of high quality 
6.5.6 
Pregnancy and Assessments of Fertility 
All pre-menopausal women who are not surgically sterile will have a serum (at screening) or 
urine (all other indicated visits) pregnancy test. A positive urine pregnancy test requires 
immediate interruption of study drug until serum B-hCG is performed and found to be 
negative. If positive, the patient must be discontinued from the trial. 
6.5.7 
Skin Prick Test 
Skin prick test to assess allergic status will be performed unless historical positive test results 
are already available. 
6.5.8 
Appropriateness of safety measurements 
The safety assessments selected are standard for this indication/patient population.

Other assessments 
6.6.1 
Pharmacokinetics 
All subjects will have one blood sample at Visit 4 and two blood samples collected for 
pharmacokinetic analysis on Visit 5. At Visit 4 a sample will be taken prior to the morning 
dose. At Visit 5, one sample will be taken before the administration of the morning dose of 
the study drug and the second sample will be taken 3 hours after the administration of the 
study drug. Each sample will be processed to produce 2 aliquots of acidified plasma (A and

B).  All samples will be given a unique sample number (as listed in the PK blood log in 
Appendix 2) and a collection number. The site is to ensure the correct sample number is 
reflected on the respective tube. Both the date and time of that morning’s (either day 42 or day 
84) study drug dose administration and the actual PK sample collection date and time will be 
entered on the PK blood collection page of the CRF. Sampling problems will be commented 
on in the CRFs. 
Both aliquots per timepoint, aliquot A and aliquot B should be shipped to the central 
laboratory (and then forwarded to the bioanalytical facility for sample analysis on separate 
occasion). 
Biofluid concentrations will be expressed in mass per volume units. All concentrations below 
the limit of quantification or missing data will be labeled as such in the concentration data 
listings. Concentrations below the Limit of Quantification will be treated as zero in summary 
statistics for concentration data only. They will not be considered for calculation of PK 
Parameters (with the exception of the pre-dose samples). 
Analysis of QAW039 will be conducted in the collected acidified plasma samples. 
Bioanalysis will be performed using a validated   LC/MS/MS assay.  
Full details on pharmacokinetic sampling, processing, collection and shipment will be 
provided in the laboratory and procedures manual. 
6.6.2 
Biomarkers 
As part of an effort to determine whether biomarkers that predict clinical efficacy responses 
can be identified, the following samples will be collected in this trial. 
Sample testing and collection procedures for the biomarkers identified in this section are 
described in greater detail in the central lab manual, which will be provided as part of this 
study. 
6.6.2.1 
Pharmacogenetic Assessments 
The Study includes an optional pharmacogenetic component which requires a separate 
signature if the subject agrees to participate. It is required as part of this protocol that the 
Investigator presents these options to the subject. 
Exploratory pharmacogenetics research studies are planned as a part of this study with the 
objectives of identifying inherited genetic factors which may influence the response to 
QAW039. These genetic factors include those that may (1) be related to asthma, (2) predict 
response to treatment with QAW039, (3) predict relative susceptibility to drug-drug 
interactions, or (4) predict genetic predisposition to side effects. The hope is to develop a 
better understanding of how subjects respond to QAW039. 
Polymorphisms that may be studied relating to the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion (ADME) of QAW039 may include UGT1A1 and other UGT polymorphisms. 
Despite continuing advances in genetics research, not all of the polymorphisms relevant to 
drug metabolism and drug action may have been identified. Therefore, additional 
polymorphisms will be added within the restricted scope of these studies as described above.

In addition, recent advances in genotyping technologies have made genome-wide association 
(GWA) studies possible. GWA studies may also be undertaken within the restricted scope of 
these studies as described above. 
Sample collection: One 10 mL blood sample will be collected at Day 1 (Visit 4) in an EDTA 
tube. After collection, the sample must be inverted several times to prevent clotting. If the 
blood draw at Visit 4 is missed, the sample should be taken at the next visit that a blood draw 
is already scheduled. 
The samples should be kept frozen at -70°C until shipped frozen to the central lab for DNA 
extraction. The extracted DNA will then be transferred to Novartis for pharmacogenetic 
analysis and storage. 
Any DNA derived from the sample that remains after analysis may be stored for up to 15years 
to address scientific questions related to QAW039 or asthma. 
In the event that a subject requests to destroy the pharmacogenetic sample, the following 
process should be followed: (1) the subject should contact the investigator; (2) the investigator 
will then provide the sponsor with the required study and subject numbers; (3) any remaining 
samples (e.g. blood or DNA) will be located and destroyed; and (4) the sponsor sends a letter 
back to the investigator to confirm that the sample was destroyed. 
A lab manual will be provided with detailed information on sample collection, handling and 
shipment. The sample collection date and exact time must be entered on the sample collection 
CRF page. 
6.6.2.2 
Transcriptomic assessments 
Messenger RNA expression profiling will be carried-out in enrolled asthma patients who are 
willing to participate in this exploratory biomarker evaluation from both blood and/or biopsy 
or brushing material. Exploratory pharmacogenomic assessments in this study aim at 
increasing our understanding of the molecular heterogeneity of asthma, and at identifying 
predictors of response to treatment.  
RNA samples will be profiled using the Illumina Human HT-12 v3 Expression BeadChip or 
equivalent. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) will be used to identify differentially 
expressed genes, and statistical clustering techniques will be used to analyze the dataset. 
Genotyping will be performed using the Illumina 660W genotyping array that contains 
660000 polymorphisms (SNPs and CNVs) evenly spread across the human genome, or an 
equivalent. This data will contribute towards genome-wide association studies of asthma 
phenotypes. One serum sample per patient - to be prepared from 10.0 mL whole blood - will 
be collected pre-dose at Visit 3 and at Visit 5 and Visit 6. 
These samples will be stored at the central lab until onward shipment for genomic data 
generation and analysis. Exploratory biomarker clinical samples remaining after analysis may 
be stored for up to 15 years to address additional relevant scientific questions. 
6.6.2.3 
Serum and plasma proteins 
Serum proteins will be measured both to see if they might identify populations who are more 
likely to respond to QAW039 than the total population and to see if changes in concentration

correlate with response: these may include but are not limited to eosinophilic cationic protein 
(ECP), eotaxin-1, IL-5, IL-13, serum total IgE, hsCRP, TNF-α, MCP-1 and IL-8. Samples 
will be collected at before the commencement of treatment at Visit 3 and Visits 4, 5 and 6. 
A sample will be taken at baseline for potential autoantibody measurement to rule out any 
pre-existing autoimmune condition (in particular Churg-Strauss Syndrome) should that prove 
necessary. 
6.6.2.4 
Fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) 
A FACS assay will be used to quantify the following cell populations (at least): CD3; CD4; 
CD8; CCR3 (gating of eosinophils); CRTh2. These will be measured in all patients at Visits 
3, 4, 5 and 6. 
6.6.2.5 
Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes 
Analytes that will be measured may include but are not limited to PGD2, PGE2, PGJ2, 
DKPGD2, ∆12-PGD2, 15d-PGD2, ∆12-PGJ2, 9α,11β-PGF2, LTB4, LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4.

Safety monitoring 
7.1 
Adverse Events 
An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or 
medical condition occurring after starting the study even if the event is not considered to be 
related to study drug. Study drug includes the investigational drug under evaluation and the 
placebo that is given during any phase of the study. Medical conditions/diseases present 
before starting the study are only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting the 
study. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce 
clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require therapy. 
The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by non-directive questioning of the patient 
at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered 
by the patient during or between visits or through physical examination, laboratory test, or 
other assessments. All adverse events must be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF with the 
following information: 
1. the severity grade [mild, moderate, severe] 
2. its relationship to the study drug(s) (suspected/not suspected)

3. its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam) 
4. whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE) 
An SAE is defined as an event which: 
• is fatal or life-threatening 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless 
hospitalization is for: 
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition 
• elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug 
• treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission 
• social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the patient’s 
general condition 
• is medically significant, i.e. defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special 
reporting requirements; see Section 7.2. 
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Treatment may include one or more of the 
following: no action taken (i.e. further observation only); study drug dosage 
adjusted/temporarily interrupted; study drug permanently discontinued due to this adverse   
event; concomitant medication given; non-drug therapy given; patient hospitalized/patient’s 
hospitalization prolonged. The action taken to treat the adverse event should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event CRF. 
Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is 
judged to be permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if 
necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the 
interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. 
Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be 
found in the Investigator Brochure (IB) or will be communicated between IB updates in the 
form of Investigator Notifications. This information will be included in the patient informed 
consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed. 
7.2 
Serious adverse event reporting 
To ensure patient safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring after the 
patient has provided informed consent and until 30 days after the patient has stopped study 
participation (defined as time of last dose of study drug taken or last visit whichever is later) 
must be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.

Protocol No. CQAW039A2208 
 
Any SAEs experienced after this 30 day period should only be reported to Novartis if the 
investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study drug. 
Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be reported as 
follow-up to the original episode, regardless of when the event occurs. This report must be 
submitted within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow-up information. An SAE 
that is considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be reported 
separately as a new event. 
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form. The investigator must assess the relationship of any SAE to study drug, complete the 
SAE Report Form in English, and send the completed, signed form by fax within 24 hours to 
the local Novartis Drug Safety and Epidemiology Department. The telephone and telecopy 
number of the contact persons in the local department of Clinical Safety and Epidemiology, 
specific to the site, are listed in the investigator folder provided to the site. The original copy 
of the SAE Report Form and the fax confirmation sheet must be kept with the case report 
form documentation at the study site. 
Follow-up information is sent to the same person to whom the original SAE Report Form was 
sent, using a new SAE Report Form stating that this is a follow-up to the previously reported 
SAE and giving the date of the original report. The follow-up information should describe 
whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was 
broken or not, and whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation. 
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert 
(new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the Novartis study drug, a Drug Safety and 
Epidemiology Department associate may urgently require further information from the 
investigator for Health Authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator 
Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this 
SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be 
collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in 
accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national regulatory requirements in 
participating countries. 
7.3 
Pregnancies 
To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy in a patient on study drug must be reported to 
Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up 
to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, 
and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or 
newborn complications. 
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form and reported by the 
investigator to the local Novartis Drug Safety and Epidemiology Department. Pregnancy 
follow-up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the 
possible relationship to the Novartis study drug of any pregnancy outcome. Any SAE 
experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report Form.

Data Review and database management 
8.1 
Site Monitoring 
Before study initiation, a Novartis representative will review the protocol and CRFs with the 
investigators and their staff at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting. 
During the study, the field monitor will visit the site regularly to check the completeness of 
patient records, the accuracy of entries on the CRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to 
Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study drug is being 
stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be 
available to assist the field monitor during these visits. 
The investigator must maintain source documents for each patient in the study, consisting of 
case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records) containing demographic and medical 
information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or 
assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the 
patient's file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by 
the patient (a signed copy is given to the patient). 
The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm 
their consistency with the CRF entries. Novartis monitoring standards require full verification 
for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
documentation of SAEs, and the recording of data that will be used for all primary and safety 
variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs are 
performed according to the study-specific monitoring plan. No information in source 
documents about the identity of the patients will be disclosed. 
8.2 
Data Collection 
Designated investigator staff will enter the data required by the protocol into Case Report 
Forms.  The Investigator must certify that the data entered into the Case Report Forms are 
complete and accurate. After database lock, the investigator will receive a CD-ROM or paper 
copies of the patient data for archiving at the investigational site. 
8.3 
Database management and quality control 
Novartis staff or designee review the data entered into the CRFs by investigational staff for 
completeness and accuracy and instruct the site personnel to make any required corrections or 
additions. 
1. Queries are sent to the investigational site using a data query.  
2. Designated investigator site staff is/are required to respond to the query and confirm or 
correct the data using a paper Data Query Form which will be faxed to the site.  
3. Site personnel will complete and sign the faxed copy and fax it back to Novartis staff or 
designee who will make the correction to the database.  
4. The signed copy of the Data Query Form is kept at the investigator site. 
Concomitant medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug 
Reference List, which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system.

Medical history/current medical conditions and adverse events will be coded using the 
Medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) terminology. 
Laboratory samples (except cytology for sputum samples and bronchial brushings and 
biopsies) will be processed centrally and the results will be sent to Novartis (or a designated 
CRO). 
ECG readings will be processed locally, at the study site and the results will be sent to 
Novartis (or a designated CRO).  
Spirometry and FeNO readings will be processed and the results will be sent to Novartis (or a 
designated CRO). 
To maximize confidentiality, all pharmacogenetic samples and the information associated 
with the samples will be double-coded to prevent the exposure of the subject’s information 
and identity. This double-coding process allows Novartis to go back and destroy the sample at 
the subject’s request. In addition, sample information is stored in one secured database while 
genetic data is stored in an independent secured database. 
The use of pharmacogenetics is exploratory. Any results from this pharmacogenetic study will 
not be placed in the patient’s medical records and will not be disclosed to patients or the 
patient’s family.

Data analysis 
9.1 
Analysis sets. 
The randomized set (RAN), which comprises all randomized patients, regardless of whether 
or not they actually received study medication, will be used for summaries of patient 
disposition and analysis populations.   
The full analysis set (FAS) will include all randomized patients who received at least one dose 
of study drug. Following the intent-to-treat principle, patients will be analyzed according to 
the treatment they were assigned to at randomization. FAS will be used for all efficacy 
variables, unless otherwise stated. 
The per-protocol set (PP) will include all patients in the FAS without any major protocol 
deviations. Major protocol deviations will be defined in the validation analysis plan prior to 
database lock and the un-blinding of the study. Patients will be analyzed according to the 
treatment they were assigned to. PP will be used for the supportive analysis of the primary 
variable. 
The safety set (SAF) will include all patients who received at least one dose of study drug 
whether or not being randomized.  Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they 
received. The safety set will be used in the analysis of all safety variables. 
Note that the FAS and safety set are the same except that the safety set allows the inclusion of 
non-randomized patients who receive study drug in error. Also the FAS assigns randomized 
treatment and the safety set assigns received treatment.

Patient demographics and other baseline characteristics 
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized using the safety set including 
age, gender, race, ethnicity, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), duration of asthma, 
smoking history, screening spirometry (% predicted FEV1, reversibility, etc.), vital signs 
(systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate), concomitant medications, ECG, 
hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, autoantibodies, and relevant medical histories. 
9.3 
Treatments (study drug, rescue medication, other concomitant 
therapies, compliance) 
The number of patients and the length of time (in days) exposed to each study drug will be 
summarized by treatment for the safety set. 
Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized by treatment for the safety set 
separated for asthma related and non-asthma related medications. Asthma related concomitant 
medications will be summarized by pre-specified categories, route of administration and 
preferred term. Non-asthma related concomitant medications will be summarized by the 
preferred term. 
Treatment compliance will be summarized by treatment for the safety set. 
9.4 
Analysis of the primary and key secondary variable(s) 
The FAS (Full Analysis Set) will be used for analysis of the primary and secondary variables, 
unless otherwise specified. 
9.4.1 
Variable(s) 
9.4.1.1 
Primary Variable 
The primary variable of the study is the change from baseline in sputum eosinophil percentage 
at week 12. As sputum eosinophil percentage has been found to follow a log-normal 
distribution, the analysis will be based on log10-transformed scale. The baseline measurement 
is defined as sputum eosinophil percentage at Visit 3 (Day 1) prior to the first dosing (on 
log10-transformed scale). 
9.4.1.2 
Secondary variable 
The secondary variables include the change from baseline to week 12 in ACQ. The baseline is 
defined as the assessment measured at Visit 3 (Day 1) prior to the first dosing. 
ACQ 
The ACQ measures asthma symptom control and consists of 7 items: 5 on symptom 
assessment, 1 on rescue bronchodilator use and 1 on airway calibre (FEV1 % predicted). All 7 
questions of the ACQ are equally weighted. Items 1-6 are scored along a 7-point response 
scale, where 0 = good controlled and 6 = poor controlled. The 7th item on % predicted FEV1 
(pre-bronchodilator) is scored by clinic staff on a 7-point scale (0 – > 95%; 1 – 90-95%; 2 – 
80-89%; 3 – 70-79%; 4 – 60-69%; 5 – 50-59%; 6 – < 50%). The average score of the 7 
questions at each visit will be calculated as the sum of scores divided by the number of

questions that were answered by the patient at the visit, as long as there were at least 6 
questions answered and the missing item is neither question 1 nor question 7. 
9.4.2 
Statistical model, hypothesis, and method of analysis 
The primary variable and the secondary variables will be summarized by treatment and 
analyzed using an ANCOVA model with treatment as the fixed effect and the respective 
baseline value as the covariate.  
Least square mean for each respective treatment group and for the treatment difference will be 
presented along with associated 95% confidence interval and p-value (2-sided) for within and 
between group comparisons. 
9.4.3 
Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations 
Missing data will be imputed for the primary variable using last observation carried forward 
(LOCF). Only post-baseline observation will be used for this purpose. 
Only 1 missing item is allowed for scoring the ACQ and, preferably, this should not be 
question 1 or question 7.  The single missing value may be interpolated by utilizing prior or 
subsequent completions of the questionnaire.  The averaged ACQ score will not be imputed. 
9.4.4 
Supportive analyses 
9.4.4.1 
Primary Variable 
For the primary variable, the analysis will be repeated for the patients in FAS without LOCF. 
Longitudinal data analysis will be performed as sensitivity analysis on the primary variable in 
the FAS, as an alternative to LOCF. Treatment effects, together with 95% confidence interval 
for difference in treatments at each visit will be presented. 
The normality assumption will be checked with a Q-Q plot of residuals for each treatment 
group. In addition, within-treatment difference between baseline and week 12 will be 
analyzed using Wilcoxon paired sample signed-rank test; between-treatment comparison on 
the change from baseline to week 12 will be analyzed using Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney rank-
sum test. 
9.4.4.2 
Secondary Variable 
For the secondary variable, additional analyses will be conducted as follows:  
• An ACQ change of 0.5 has been validated as the minimally important clinical difference 
(Juniper et al, 2005). The proportion of patients with a decrease in ACQ of > 0.5 will be 
summarized by treatment and analyzed using a logistic regression. The model includes 
terms for treatment as the fixed effect and the baseline ACQ score as a covariate. The odds 
ratio of QAX576/Placebo will be computed, along with associated 95% confidence 
intervals. 
• A sensitivity analysis using different imputation algorithms for missing data at week 12 
will be performed in the FAS.

Analysis of other variables 
9.5.1 
Efficacy variables 
9.5.1.1 
Sputum cell analysis 
The change from baseline at week 6 and at week 18 will be also summarized by treatment and 
analyzed using an ANCOVA model with treatment as the fixed effect and the baseline sputum 
eosinophil percentage as the covariate. The normality assumption will be checked with a Q-Q 
plot of residuals for each treatment group and if this is not adequately met a non-parametric 
test will be used instead (refer to Section 9.4.4.1).   
To explore the persistency of efficacious effect following the cessation of therapy, data will 
be also analyzed similarly based on change from week 12 to week 18. 
9.5.1.2 
Asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) 
The change from baseline at week 6 and at week 18 and the change from week 12 and week 
18 will be summarized and analyzed similarly with baseline ACQ as the covariate. Refer to 
Section 9.5.1.1. 
9.5.1.3 
Pulmonary function tests 
9.5.1.3.1 Spirometry 
% predicted FEV1 (pre-bronchodilator) is calculated as:   
100 x   FEV1 (pre β2-agonists at V2) 
                         Predicted FEV1  
The change from baseline to week 6, week, 12, and week 18 in % predicted FEV1 will be 
summarized and analyzed in a similar way as described in Section 9.5.1.1 with baseline % 
predicted FEV1 as the covariate. To explore the persistency of efficacious effect following the 
cessation of therapy, data will be also analyzed similarly based on change from week 12 to 
week 18. 
9.5.1.3.2 Impulse Oscillometry 
R5-R20 (kPaL-1s-1) and AX (kPaL-1)  are measured with impulse oscillometry. The change 
from baseline at week 12 and at week 18 and the change from week 12 and week 18 will be 
summarized and analyzed similarly with the respective baseline value as the covariate. Refer 
to Section 9.5.1.1.

9.5.1.3.3 Multiple Breath Washout (MBW) 
Sacin (L-1) is measured with multiple breath washout. The change from baseline at week 12 and 
at week 18 and the change from week 12 and week 18 will be summarized and analyzed 
similarly with the respective baseline value as the covariate. Refer to Section 9.5.1.1. 
9.5.2 
Safety variables 
All safety endpoints (i.e. adverse events, laboratory data, vital signs, and ECG) will be 
summarized by treatment for all patients of the safety population. All data will be included in 
the analysis regardless of rescue medication use. 
9.5.2.1 
Adverse events 
All adverse events which start after the first dose of study medication will be considered as a 
treatment emergent adverse event. Adverse events that start during the study but before the 
time of the first dose of study drug (e.g. screening period) will be classified as a prior adverse 
event and will be included in adverse events listings, but will not be summarized.   
Treatment emergent adverse events with the number and percentage of patients having any 
adverse event overall, by system organ class and preferred term will be provided for:  
• all adverse events 
• adverse events by maximum severity 
• adverse events suspected by the investigator as study drug-related 
• serious adverse events 
• adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug 
9.5.2.2 
Laboratory data 
A central laboratory will be used to analyze and report blood chemistry/hematology/urinalysis 
The following analyses will be performed, where appropriate, for central measurements of 
hematology and blood chemistry tests: 
• standard descriptive statistics for values measured at baseline and post-baseline visits 
including changes from baseline 
• shift tables relative to the normal ranges between baseline and post-baseline visits 
• number (and percentage) of patients with clinically notable changes for selected tests 
9.5.2.3 
Vital signs 
Vital signs (i.e. blood pressure and pulse rate) will be summarized with standard descriptive 
statistics of raw data and changes from baseline for each visit separately.  The numbers of 
patients with vital signs meeting the definition of notably abnormal will be presented by 
parameter.

9.5.2.4 
Electrocardiogram 
The ECGs will be centrally read by an ECG vendor, including quantitative assessments (RR, 
PR, QRS and QT intervals, and heart rate) and qualitative diagnoses. The QTc will be 
calculated by the ECG vendor from the QT interval and RR (in seconds) by two methods: 
(1) Using Bazett’s formula: QTc = QT/√ RR 
(2) Using Fridericia’s formula: QTc = QT / 3√ RR, where 3√ denotes the cube root 
The quantitative assessments will be based on the mean of the measurements at each 
scheduled time point for each visit separately. The analysis, such as change from baseline and 
clinical notables, will be summarized by treatment based on the averaged values. The baseline 
measurement will be the mean of measurement at Visit 4 pre-dose (-35 min).   
Changes from baseline will be summarized by treatment for the mean heart rate and ECG 
intervals including QTc for each scheduled time point at each visit and for the maximum post-
baseline value. 
Notable QTc values will be summarized.  A notable value is defined as a QTc interval of 
greater than 450 msec for males and greater than 470 msec females.  Patients meeting a more 
extreme notable criterion of >500 msec will be also summarized for males and females. The 
notable change in QTc will be also summarized. The categories used for the change in QTc 
are less than 30 msec, 30 to 60 msec and greater than 60 msec. 
The qualitative assessment includes overall ECG interpretation and Morphological and 
rhythm abnormalities. Shift tables will be provided in order to compare a patient’s baseline 
overall ECG interpretation to the interpretation at each time point at each post-baseline visit.  
Using the morphologic determinations, the number and percentage of patients with qualitative 
ECG abnormality will be summarized for each visit and each timepoint. The abnormality will 
be summarized by baseline condition (NO/YES) for each type of abnormality (i.e. newly 
occurring cases, or persistent/recurrent cases). The qualitative ECG abnormality will be 
determined by abnormality of Rhythm, Arrhythmia, Conduction, Morphology, Myocardial 
infarction, ST segment, T wave abnormalities, abnormal U wave.

Resource utilization 
Healthcare resource utilization will not be collected in this study.

Health-related Quality of Life 
9.5.4.1 
Asthma control questionnaire (AQLQs) 
See section 9.4. 
9.5.4.2 
Asthma quality of life (AQLQs) 
The 32 items in the AQLQ(s) are divided into four domain-specific scores and a total score as 
follows:  
Activity limitations = Mean of Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 19, 25, 28, 31, 32 (11 items) 
Symptoms = Mean of Items 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 29, 30 (12 items)

Emotional function = Mean of Items 7, 13, 15, 21, 27 (5 items) 
Environmental stimuli = Mean of Items 9, 17, 23, 26 (4 items) 
Overall Score = Mean of Items 1 to 32 (32 items) 
Each item of the AQLQ is equally weighted and scored along a 7-point scale, where 1 
indicates maximal impairment and 7 indicates no impairment. Thus, higher scores indicate 
better asthma-related HRQOL. There is a mean score calculated for each of the four domains, 
as well as an overall quality-of-life score, which is the mean score of all 32 items. The 
resultant overall scores will be between 1 and 7. 
The developer suggests no more than 10% of missing data. This means no more than 3 
missing responses for the overall score and no more than 1 missing response per domain.  For 
the symptoms and activity domain scores, one missing value per domain is allowed.  For the 
emotional function and environmental stimuli domain scores, no missing values are allowed.  
The minimal important difference (MID), defined as "the smallest difference in score which 
patients perceive as beneficial and would mandate, in the absence of troublesome side effects 
and excessive cost, a change in the patients management," has been established as 0.5 points 
per item (Juniper et al, 2006).  
Between treatments analyses of change from baseline scores by visit will be performed using 
the same model as specified in section 9.4.2 with baseline AQLQ score as the covariate. Least 
squares means and associated 95% confidence intervals will be presented for treatments and 
treatment differences. 
9.5.5 
Pharmacokinetics 
All subjects with evaluable pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter data will be included in the 
pharmacokinetic data analysis. 
Pharmacokinetic variables 
Biofluid concentrations will be expressed in mass per volume units. All concentrations below 
the limit of quantification or missing data will be labeled as such in the concentration data 
listings. Concentrations below the Limit of Quantification will be treated as zero in summary 
statistics for concentration data only. They will not be considered for calculation of PK 
Parameters (with the exception of the pre-dose samples). 
PK samples are being collected to assess patient compliance with the dosage regimen 
therefore due to the sparse nature of the sample collection scheme pharmacokinetic 
parameters will not be determined using non-compartmental method(s). Descriptive statistics 
of plasma concentrations data will include mean, SD, and CV, min and max.

associations are evaluated with exploratory analyses.  A range of statistical tests (chi-square 
tests, ANCOVAs, linear and logistic regression) are used for the analyses.  Additional data, 
from subsequent clinical trials, are often needed to confirm associations. Alternatively, if the 
numbers of subjects enrolled in the study are too small to complete proper statistical analyses, 
these data may be combined, as appropriate, with those from other studies to enlarge the data 
set for analysis. 
9.5.6.2 
Pharmacogenomic data analyses  
The analysis of pharmacogenomic data will be performed at the Fundacio Privada Parc, 
Cientfic DE, Barcelona, Spain. Quality control of all individual samples and molecular data 
will be conducted. The analysis of genomic data per se may be assisted by the use of “in 
house’ and commercial expert applications and databases. A range of statistics-based 
approaches - both supervised and unsupervised - will be applied to the data. 
9.5.7 
Biomarkers 
9.5.7.1 
Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) 
Exhaled Nitric Oxide is a non-invasive marker for airway inflammation. It will be measured 
following the recently published guidelines on standardized techniques.  
The change from baseline will be summarized by treatment group. The mean FeNO as 
calculated from two measurements will be used for analysis. Treatment group comparisons 
will be performed by the same model as specified in Section 9.5.1.1 with baseline FeNO as 
the covariate. Least squares means and associated 95% confidence intervals will be presented 
for treatments and treatment differences.   
9.5.7.2 
Other efficacy biomarkers 
Other efficacy biomarkers are measured, including 
• High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) 
• Hyperpolarized Helium-3 MRI Imaging (He-3 MRI) 
• Bronchial Biopsies and Brushings 
• Volatile Organic Compounds 
Data will be summarized and analyzed in a similar way as described in section 9.5.1.1. 
9.5.8 
PK/PD 
Population modeling may be undertaken to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of QAW039 based 
on the sparse data collected in this study as well as in other clinical studies from the QAW039 
program. A search may be performed to identify variables that impact PK. This will include, 
but is not limited to, an investigation of patient demographics and other baseline 
characteristics. Results from such population analyses will be reported separately.  
PK/PD modeling may also be attempted for exploratory purposes.

Interim analyses 
An interim analysis (IA) will be conducted when all the patients complete the treatment phase 
(i.e. week 12, visit 5). This IA is intended to allow possible re-sizing of the study to be 
considered and to provide early delivery of efficacy data to facilitate forward planning of the 
QAW039 program. This IA will include all the applicable primary/secondary/exploratory 
efficacy endpoints, as well as safety data available at the time of IA.

Sample size calculation 
Table 9-1 provides the sample sizes required for each respective outcome measure (the 
primary and secondary variables) in order to achieve an 80% power to detect the minimally 
important difference at a two-tailed 5% significance level.  
This study is aimed to power for a 50% reduction in sputum eosinophil percentage. This is 
equivalent to an absolute reduction in log10 (sputum eosinophil percentage) of log102 = 0.301 
(Inman et al, 2002, Barnes et al, 2011). The minimally important differences for the primary 
and key secondary endpoints are listed in Table 9-1.

With 30 patients per arm to be randomized, it is expected that 24 patients per arm will 
complete week 12 assessment, assuming the dropout rate during the course of treatment phase 
(12 weeks) is 20%. With this sample size, the primary and secondary endpoints achieve ≥80% 
power to detect minimally important difference between QAW039 and placebo, as specified 
in Table 9-1.

regulations (including European Directive 2001/20/EC, US Code of Federal Regulations Title 
21, and Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare), and with the ethical principles laid 
down in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
10.2 
Informed consent procedures 
Eligible patients may only be included in the study after providing written (witnessed, where 
required by law or regulation), IRB/IEC-approved informed consent, or, if incapable of doing 
so, after such consent has been provided by a legally acceptable representative of the patient. 
In cases where the patient’s representative gives consent, the patient should be informed about 
the study to the extent possible given his/her understanding. If the patient is capable of doing 
so, he/she should indicate assent by personally signing and dating the written informed 
consent document or a separate assent form. Informed consent must be obtained before 
conducting any study-specific procedures (i.e. all of the procedures described in the protocol). 
The process of obtaining informed consent should be documented in the patient source 
documents.  
Novartis will provide to investigators in a separate document a proposed informed consent 
form that complies with the ICH GCP guideline and regulatory requirements and is 
considered appropriate for this study. Any changes to the proposed consent form suggested by 
the investigator must be agreed to by Novartis before submission to the IRB/IEC, and a copy 
of the approved version must be provided to the Novartis monitor or designee after IRB/IEC 
approval. 
Women of child bearing potential should be informed that taking the study treatment may 
involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and agree that 
in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement for the 
duration of the study. If there is any question that the patient will not reliably comply, they 
should not be entered in the study.  
The study includes some optional components which require a separate signature if the patient 
agrees to participate. It is required as part of this protocol that the investigator presents these 
options to the patient. The process for obtaining consent should be exactly the same as 
described above for the main informed consent. 
Declining to participate in these assessments will in no way affect the patient’s ability to 
participate in the main research study. 
In the event that Novartis wants to perform testing on the samples that are not described in 
this protocol, additional Institutional Review Board and/or ethics committee approval will be 
obtained. 
10.3 
Responsibilities of the investigator and IRB/IEC 
The protocol and the proposed informed consent form must be reviewed and approved by a 
properly constituted Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee/Research 
Ethics Board (IRB/IEC) before study start. A signed and dated statement that the protocol and 
informed consent have been approved by the IRB/IEC must be given to Novartis before study 
initiation. Prior to study start, the investigator is required to sign a protocol signature page 
confirming his/her agreement to conduct the study in accordance with these documents and all

Protocol No. CQAW039A2208 
 
of the instructions and procedures found in this protocol and to give access to all relevant data 
and records to Novartis monitors, auditors, Novartis Clinical Quality Assurance 
representatives, designated agents of Novartis, IRBs/IECs/REBs, and regulatory authorities as 
required. If an inspection of the clinical site is requested by a regulatory authority, the 
investigator must inform Novartis immediately that this request has been made. 
10.4 
Publication of study protocol and results 
Novartis assures that the key design elements of this protocol will be posted in a publicly 
accessible database such as clinicaltrials.gov. In addition, upon study completion and 
finalization of the study report the results of this trial will be either submitted for publication 
and/or posted in a publicly accessible database of clinical trial results. 
11 
Protocol adherence 
Investigators ascertain they will apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations. Under no 
circumstances should the investigator contact Novartis or its agents, if any, monitoring the 
trial to request approval of a protocol deviation, as no authorized deviations are permitted. If 
the investigator feels a protocol deviation would improve the conduct of the study this must 
be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment is agreed upon by 
Novartis and approved by the IRB/IEC it cannot be implemented. All significant protocol 
deviations will be recorded and reported in the CSR. 
11.1 
Protocol Amendments 
Any change or addition to the protocol can only be made in a written protocol amendment that 
must be approved by Novartis, Health Authorities where required, and the IRB/IEC. Only 
amendments that are required for patient safety may be implemented prior to IRB/IEC 
approval. Notwithstanding the need for approval of formal protocol amendments, the 
investigator is expected to take any immediate action required for the safety of any patient 
included in this study, even if this action represents a deviation from the protocol. In such 
cases, Novartis should be notified of this action and the IRB/IEC at the study site should be 
informed within 10 working days.

Appendices 
Appendix 1 Clinically notable laboratory values and vital signs  
Patients with an ALT or AST ≥ 5 x ULN, or with ALT or AST ≥ 2.5 x ULN and total 
bilirubin ≥ 1.5xULN, at any visit should be withdrawn from trial. An alert should be sent to 
the investigator and sponsor if patients experience these abnormal liver function test results. 
The central laboratory will flag laboratory values falling outside of the normal ranges on the 
central laboratory report (which the investigator should review and sign off) and the 
investigator will report any values considered clinically significant in the CRF. 
Notable values for vital signs and change from baseline will be summarized. A notable value 
is defined as follows: heart rate of <40 and >90 bpm; systolic blood pressure of <90 and >140 
mmHg; diastolic blood pressure of <50 and >90 mmHg. 
For ECGs a notable QTc value is defined as a QTc (Fridericia’s) interval of greater than 450 
msec for males and 470 msec for females – all such ECGs will be flagged by the cardiologist 
and require assessment for clinical relevance by the Investigator. 
Patients with a heart rate of >100 bpm measured on 2 occasions, approximately 10 minutes 
apart, whilst resting, should be withdrawn from the trial.

Appendix 3: Spirometry Guidance 
Spirometry 
Equipment 
Spirometers must meet the specifications and performance criteria recommended in the 
American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) Standardization of 
Spirometry1. Spirometers must have the capacity to print FVC tracings. All spirometry values 
should be reported at BTPS by the method established by the manufacturer. 
Calibration 
The spirometer should be calibrated every morning before any spirometric measurements for 
the study are performed. Calibration reports should be printed and stored as source data at the 
site. 
Preparing the test subject 
On study days when spirometry will be performed, patients should refrain from the following: 
• Coffee, tea, chocolate, cola and other caffeine-containing beverages and foods and ice 
cold beverages for 4 hours prior to spirometry 
• Alcohol for 4 hours prior to spirometry 
• Strenuous activity for 12 hours prior to spirometry 
• Smoking within at least 1 hour of testing 
• Exposure to environmental smoke, dust or areas with strong odors 
Every effort should be made to assure consistent testing conditions throughout the study. A 
seated position with nose clips is recommended to reduce risks related to dizziness or 
syncope. When possible, spirometry should be conducted by the same technician using the 
same spirometer. To minimize the effects of diurnal variation on lung function, spirometry 
visits should start at approximately the same time of day at each visit. 
Performing Spirometry 
The subject’s age, height and gender will be entered into the spirometer. It is important that 
the height is measured accurately at the study site. Spirometry, an effort-dependent test, 
requires careful instruction and cooperation of the subject. The technician should ensure a 
good seal around the mouthpiece, and confirm that the subject’s posture is correct. The 
subject should be instructed to perform a maximal inspiration, followed by maximum forced 
expiration until no more air can be exhaled or for at least 6 seconds. Expiration must be rapid 
with exertion of maximal effort. The results of spirometry should meet the ATS/ERS criteria 
for acceptability and repeatability. Acceptability criteria should be applied before repeatability 
is determined. 
Number of trials 
A minimum of 3 acceptable forced vital capacity (FVC) maneuvers should be performed. If a 
subject is unable to perform a single acceptable maneuver after 8 attempts, testing may be 
discontinued.

Acceptability 
An acceptable maneuver has the following characteristics: 
• No hesitation or false start; 
• A rapid start; 
• No cough, especially during the first second of the maneuver; 
• No glottic closure or obstruction by tongue or dentures 
• No early termination of exhalation (minimum exhalation time of 6 seconds is 
recommended, or no volume change for at least 1 second) or the subject cannot continue 
to exhale further 
Repeatability 
The 2 largest FVC and FEV1 values from 3 acceptable maneuvers should not vary by more 
than 0.150 L. 
Recording of data 
The highest FEV1 and FVC from any of the acceptable curves are recorded. (The highest 
FEV1 and FVC may not necessarily result from the same acceptable curve).  
Predicted normal 
For subjects greater than 18 years of age, this study will utilize the spirometric predication 
equation standards for the European Community for Coal and Steel 2 or Nhanes3. For 
children ages less than 18 years of age the reference ranges published by Polgar 4 will be 
used. 
Reversibility 
All reversibility evaluations should follow the recommendations of the ATS/ERS Task force: 
Standardization of Lung Function Testing1. A baseline spirometry assessment should be 
performed after a washout period of at least: 
• 6 h for short-acting β2-agonists 
• 8 h short-acting anticholinergics 
• 48 h for long-acting β2-agonist 
• 7 days long-acting anticholinergic 
• 7 days indacaterol 
Administer 400µg of salbutamol/360µg of albuterol following the completion of the baseline 
assessment. A second spirometry assessment is then performed within 10 to 15 minutes after 
administration of the salbumatol/albuterol. 
Reversibility is calculated as: 
100 x FEV1 (post β2-agonists) – FEV1 (baseline) 
FEV1 (baseline) 
Subjects will be considered reversible if an increase of at least 12% (and 200 ml) is 
demonstrated after administration of the bronchodilator.

Protocol No. CQAW039A2208 
 
Amendment rationale  
This protocol has been amended mainly to provide clarification about the interim analysis to 
be performed in the study. 
At time of writing nine patients had been enrolled into the study. The amendment is not 
expected to impact the study results and the changes do not impact on the safety of patients 
participating in the study. 
Changes to the protocol 
More information regarding type and timing of the interim analysis to be performed in the 
study has been provided making clear that a futility analysis will be performed when 
approximately 30 patients have completed their Visit 5. Main protocol sections modified due 
to this change are sections 3.1, 3.5 and 9.6. 
The upper limit for the range of admissible Body Mass Index (BMI) has been increased from 
40 kg/m2 to 45 kg/m2. This change has been made in order to allow the inclusion of more 
patients with severe asthma as it is now apparent that many of the more severely asthmatic 
patients in our study population have higher BMIs. Main protocol sections modified due to 
this change are Section 4.2 and the Protocol Synopsis section. 
The time points for performing body plethysmography and carbon monoxide transfer have 
been indicated in the assessment schedule (Table 6-1). 
Further, clarification has been provided that the burden of tests assessment with regards to 
testing for volatile organic compounds applies to all patients and not only those undergoing 
MRI. This clarification is reflected in Section 6.4.10 and footnote 9c in the assessment 
schedule (Table 6-1). 
Also incorporated, are other smaller editorial changes that include correction of typographical 
errors and rewording to ensure consistency between protocol sections. 
Changes to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version of the 
protocol using strike through red font for deletions and red underlined for insertions. 
A copy of this amended protocol will be sent to the Institutional Review Board 
(IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committee (IECs) and Health Authorities. 
The changes described in this amended protocol require IRB/IEC approval prior to 
implementation. In addition, if the changes herein affect the Informed Consent, sites are 
required to update and submit for approval a revised Informed Consent that takes into account 
the changes described in this amended protocol.

Protocol synopsis 
Title of study: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, study examining the effect of 
orally administered QAW039 on sputum eosinophil levels and other efficacy 
outcomes in patients with sputum eosinophilia and persistent asthma 
Purpose and rationale: The purpose of this study is to determine whether, in 
patients with sputum eosinophilia (≥ 2%) and persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma, 
12-weeks treatment with QAW039 at a dose of 225 mg b.i.d. (compared to placebo), 
on top of conventional treatment, reduces the levels of eosinophils in induced sputum. 
As well as providing comparative (against placebo) safety data from this population of 
patients, measurements made in this study will also be used to establish whether this 
treatment improves other measures of asthma disease activity, lung function and 
lung pathology. 
Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate a statistically 
significant reduction in sputum eosinophil levels in inadequately controlled, moderate-
to-severe asthmatics (GINA 2-5), with sputum eosinophilia after treatment with 
QAW039 for 12 weeks compared to placebo. 
The secondary objectives include: 
• To demonstrate that QAW039 provides significantly superior control of 
asthmatic symptoms as measured by the asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) 
compared to placebo. 
• To assess safety and tolerability of QAW039 in this moderate-to-severe 
asthmatic population as compared to placebo. 
Population: The study population will include male and female symptomatic patients 
with sputum eosinophilia and moderate-to-severe asthma (GINA 2-5) who are 
incompletely controlled on their current therapy. They will be chosen to investigate 
the efficacy of QAW039 as an add-on to their current therapy. Patients aged over 18 
years will be selected for the trial. A total of 60 patients (30 per treatment arm) will be 
randomized from a single center in the UK. 
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria: 
Inclusion criteria:  
• Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is 
performed. 
• Males and females of any race who are over the age of 18 years at the time 
informed consent is obtained. 
• Physician diagnosis of asthma, as per GINA guidelines GINA guidelines and 
currently prescribed ICS or ICS-LABA therapy.  
• Patients who are demonstrated to have reversible airway obstruction, 
significant FEV1 variability or airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), or who 
have shown such responses in previous test(s) within the last five years.

Investigational and reference therapy: QAW039 (and matching placebo) will be 
provided as hard gelatin capsules in blister packs of 2 dose strengths (25mg and 
150mg) to deliver 225 mg b.i.d..  
Study design: This study uses a 2-treatment arm (Placebo or QAW039), parallel-
group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design.  
After signing informed consent (Visit 1), patients will undergo a 2-week placebo run-in 
period during which their clinical stability and suitability for randomisation will be 
assessed. Asthma patients who are already receiving ICS or ICS-LABA therapy are 
the target population for this study. All patients will be allowed to continue on their 
current therapy. At the baseline visit (visit 3) all eligible patients will be randomized to 
QAW039 (225 mg b.i.d.) or placebo for a treatment duration of 12 weeks. At the end 
of the 12-week treatment period (visit 5), all patients will receive placebo until the 6-
week post-treatment assessment (visit 6). Both during the run-in and wash-out 
periods, the study will be single-blind because physicians will know that patients are 
on placebo, however the 12-week treatment period will be double-blind. 
Visits to assess safety and efficacy are scheduled at 6, 12, and 18 weeks post-
randomization. The assessment to address the primary objectives will be performed 
at the end of the treatment period (week 12).

Data analysis: The purpose of this study is to determine whether, in patients with 
sputum eosinophilia (≥ 2%) and persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma, 12-weeks 
treatment with QAW039 at a dose of 225 mg b.i.d. (compared to placebo), on top of 
conventional treatment, reduces the levels of eosinophils in induced sputum. As well 
as providing comparative (against placebo) safety data from this population of 
patients, measurements made in this study will also be used to establish whether this 
treatment improves other measures of asthma disease activity, lung function and 
lung pathology.  
The primary variable of the study is the change from baseline in sputum eosinophil 
percentage at week 12. As sputum eosinophil percentage has been found to follow a 
log-normal distribution, the analysis will be based on log10-transformed scale. The 
baseline measurement is defined as sputum eosinophil percentage at Visit 3 (Day 1) 
prior to the first dosing (on log10-transformed scale)

Introduction 
1.1 
Background 
Many patients with asthma fail to achieve adequate control of symptoms and exacerbations 
when treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or combinations of ICS and long-acting beta-
agonists (LABA). Failure to respond to topical therapy may be due to multiple factors, 
including poor adherence, inadequate inhaler technique or corticosteroid resistance. 
Furthermore, there is evidence that some patients with asthma have prominent small airway 
disease that cannot be reached by standard inhalers. Such patients may require systemic (oral) 
therapy to control their airway inflammation. Current treatment options include the addition 
of a leukotriene modifier such as montelukast, but not all patients respond to this, and a 
significant proportion require step-up to long-term oral corticosteroids to achieve control, an 
unattractive option given the well-known side-effects of osteoporosis, muscle wasting and 
bruising. There is thus a need for effective oral anti-inflammatory therapies for asthma with 
greater efficacy than montelukast. 
QAW039 is a highly selective and potent antagonist of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) that binds to 
the CRTH2 (DP2) receptor, but not to the more general homeostatic PGD2 receptor, DP1. 
QAW039 is expected to work by binding CRTH2 receptors on eosinophils and CRTH2+ T 
lymphocytes in the blood, thus inhibiting the migration of eosinophils and CRTH2+ CD4+ 
lymphocytes into the airway tissues. Since these are major effector cells that drive the airway 
inflammation in asthma, the symptoms of the disease should be improved.  
The study has been focussed on sputum eosinophilia, as a primary endpoint, for a number of 
reasons. Firstly, the reduction of sputum eosinophilia will be further confirmation of the 
mechanism of action of this target in man and will provide comparative data against earlier 
studies with competitor compounds (Singh et al, 2009; Barnes et al, 2011). Secondly, the 
control of sputum eosinophilia has been shown to be an important measure in predicting the 
efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatments in asthma. Adults who had treatment adjusted to 
sputum eosinophils had a significantly reduced number of exacerbations compared with 
controls who did not. The comparative risk for exacerbations of standard care versus tailored 
care was 726 per 1000 versus 488 per 1000 (OR 0.36 [90% CI: 0.2 to 0.64]) (Petsky et al, 
2010; Petsky et al 2007; Chlumsky et al, 2006; Jayaram et al, 2006; Green et al, 2002). 
Finally, therapeutic reduction of sputum eosinophilia has been shown to significantly decrease 
hospitalisations due to asthma exacerbation and to have beneficial impact on the geometry of 
the respiratory tract (Haldar et al, 2009).  
Further information regarding QAW039 can be obtained from the Investigators’ Brochure.

Purpose  
The purpose of this study is to determine whether, in patients with sputum eosinophilia (≥ 
2%) and persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma, 12-weeks treatment with QAW039 at a dose 
of 225 mg b.i.d. (compared to placebo), on top of conventional treatment, reduces the levels 
of eosinophils in induced sputum. As well as providing comparative (against placebo) safety 
data from this population of patients, measurements made in this study will also be used to

Study objectives 
2.1 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in 
sputum eosinophil levels in inadequately controlled, moderate-to-severe asthmatics (GINA 2-
5), with sputum eosinophilia after treatment with QAW039 for 12 weeks compared to placebo. 
2.2 
Secondary objectives 
• To demonstrate that QAW039 provides significantly superior control of asthmatic 
symptoms as measured by the asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) compared to placebo. 
• To assess safety and tolerability of QAW039 in this moderate-to-severe asthmatic 
population as compared to placebo. 
2.3 
Exploratory objectives 
• To demonstrate that QAW039 provides significant improvement in standard physiological 
markers such as FEV1, as well as specific small airway markers measured with multiple 
breath washout (MBW) and impulse oscillometry, namely Sacin, R5-R20 and AX, 
compared to placebo.  
• To explore whether the efficacious effect of QAW039 therapy persists following the 
cessation of therapy. 
• To explore whether quantitative computed tomography (CT) biomarkers at baseline 
predict response to therapy with QAW039. 
• To explore changes in air trapping, as evaluated by quantitative computed tomography 
(CT), after 12 weeks of treatment with QAW039 versus placebo. 
• To explore changes in health-related quality of life as measured by the standardised 
Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQs) after 12 weeks of treatment with 
QAW039 versus placebo. 
• To explore changes in blood proteomic and transcriptomic profile following 12 weeks of 
treatment with QAW039 versus placebo. 
• To explore changes in exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOCs) following 12 weeks of 
treatment with QAW039 versus placebo. 
• To explore the effect of QAW039 on ventilation heterogeneity, as measured by 
hyperpolarised helium-3 MRI (He-3 MRI), compared to placebo. 
• To explore whether QAW039 attenuates eosinophilic airway inflammation as measured 
by bronchial brushings and bronchial biopsies, compared to placebo. 
• To explore whether QAW039 attenuates features of remodelling in bronchial biopsies 
(including but not limited to the assessment of histological features of inflammatory and 
goblet cell number, reticular basement membrane thickness and assessment of collagen 
deposition) compared to placebo.

Investigational plan 
3.1 
Study design 
This study uses a 2-treatment arm (Placebo or QAW039), parallel-group, double-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled design. 
After signing informed consent (Visit 1), patients will undergo a 2-week placebo run-in period 
during which their clinical stability and suitability for randomisation will be assessed. Asthma 
patients who are already receiving ICS or ICS-LABA therapy are the target population for this 
study. All patients will be allowed to continue on their current therapy. At the baseline visit 
(visit 3) all eligible patients will be randomized to QAW039 (225 mg b.i.d.) or placebo for a 
treatment duration of 12 weeks. At the end of the 12-week treatment period (visit 5), all 
patients will receive placebo until the 6-week post-treatment assessment (visit 6). Both during 
the run-in and wash-out periods, the study will be single-blind because physicians will know 
that patients are on placebo, however the 12-week treatment period will be double-blind. 
Visits to assess safety and efficacy are scheduled at 6, 12, and 18 weeks post-randomization. 
The assessment to address the primary objectives will be performed at the end of the 
treatment period (week 12). An interim analysis for futility will be conducted when 
approximately 50% of the patients have completed their Visit 5. This interim analysis is 
intended to provide early delivery of key data points to facilitate forward planning of the 
program.

3.2 
Rationale of study design 
The study is designed to explore the anti-inflammatory and disease-modifying potential of 
QAW039 in asthmatics in vivo. It will examine the effect of QAW039 on top of conventional 
background therapy in a group of persistent, uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe asthmatics with 
sputum eosinophilia. In order preserve trial integrity, this will be a parallel design study in 
which treatment is allocated in a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled manner. 
Placebo will be used in both active and placebo treatment groups during the run-in period in 
order to minimize the impact of “placebo-effect” on baseline fluctuations in patient reported 
outcomes prior to randomization. All patients will be allocated to placebo at visit 5 so that the 
knowledge that treatment has been withdrawn does not influence their assessment of their 
disease status. 
The rationale for studying this group of patients is supported by the findings from an interim 
analysis of our clinical study, CQAW039A2201, in mild-to-moderate asthmatics. In this 
analysis, we found that patients who either have the most pronounced baseline reduction in 
predicted FEV1 (<70%) and/or those who have pre-treatment, circulating eosinophilia (>300 
eosinophils per µL blood) appeared to benefit to the greatest extent from 4 weeks treatment 
with the CRTH2 antagonist, QAW039, either in terms of change in ACQ score or % change 
in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 or both. 
By enriching further still for these two characteristics – sputum eosinophilia and circulating 
eosinophilia both correlate with disease severity and aspect of lung function in asthma (Snell 
& Newbold, 2008) – and allowing further time for the therapeutic response to develop 
(section 3.3 below), we believe we will enhance the chance of measuring an enhanced 
therapeutic response and the possibility of observing fundamental changes in the underlying 
structure/function relationship in the asthmatic lung. 
3.3 
Rationale of dose/regimen, duration of treatment 
Data from a one month study with a CRTH2 antagonist showed a continuous increase in 
FEV1 over 4 weeks (Barnes et al, 2011). This observation is consistent with the mechanism of 
action, since CRTH2 antagonists, such as QAW039, should block inflammatory cells from 
entering the lung.  The duration of 12 weeks was chosen because it is not clear when maximal 
efficacy will be observed from this type of treatment and this is the longest time covered by 
current toxicology studies for QAW039. Furthermore, as observations are being made with 
regards to changes in lung histology and geometry, we wished to give the maximal time to 
allow the best signal of efficacy to develop.  
In CQAW039A2201, patients were dosed once daily for 4 weeks with 500 mg. At interim 
analysis when the first 63 patients had completed the study, no SAEs or deaths had occurred 
and the AEs observed did not significantly differ in their nature or severity between the 
active- and placebo-treated cohorts of patients.  
A twice daily dose of 225 mg (totaling 450 mg per day) will be included in this study and will 
be dummied with matching placebo in order to prevent bias. Using a population based PK 
model constructed using data from earlier studies (CQAW039A2101 and CQAW039A2102) 
the anticipated plasma AUCtau of 11.6 µg.h/mL [90% CI: 5.39-24.5] overlaps considerably

with the AUCtau modeled from a 500 mg daily dose (AUCtau 12.9 µg.h/mL [90% CI: 6.00 – 
27.1]). 
At steady state, the fluctuation index determined following 7 days of dosing in 
CQAW039A2102 was 315 % and 349 % following 100 mg q.d. and 300 mg q.d. dosing, is 
reduced to 135 % following 250 mg b.i.d. dosing reflecting the large peak to trough ratio 
following a q.d. regimen. The 450 mg will therefore be given in 2 equal doses (225 mg b.i.d., 
total of 8 capsules per day) to minimize the peak to trough ratio observed following q.d. 
dosing. In this way, we will maintain a higher minimum drug concentration compared to a 
once-daily regimen. The simulated concentration time profiles following 450 mg q.d. and 225 
b.i.d. are illustrated below.

represented by darker shades 
3.4 
Rationale for choice of comparator 
Placebo will be used to preserve trial integrity. 
As both placebo and QAW039 will be given in addition to the patients’ conventional (pre-
study) treatment there is no appropriate positive control that can be used in this situation given 
the range of disease severities to be included.

3.5 
Purpose and timing of interim analyses/design adaptations 
There will be an interim analysis for futility when data has been collected for approximately 
50% of the patients following their Visit 5. 
The purpose of this interim analysis is to provide early delivery of key data points to facilitate 
forward planning of the program. 
3.6 
Risks and benefits 
The most significant preclinical findings have been an increase in heart rate in dogs and liver 
findings in mice (see exposure margins in investigator brochure). Neither of these events has 
been observed in other species. Both of these findings are readily monitored and have not 
been identified in the three healthy volunteer studies so far completed. Indeed, every 
indication from these studies suggests that QAW039 is safe and well tolerated. Our interim 
analysis of the first 63 mild-to-moderate, persistent asthmatic patients in the 
CQAW039A2201 study also showed no fatalities or serious adverse events and demonstrated 
no significant differences in the frequencies of adverse events between placebo and actively 
treated subjects. 
A potential risk we have identified of relevance to this study, given the likely frequency of 
statin co-medication in this group of patients (estimated to be around 25%), is the interaction 
of QAW039 with the drug transporter molecule, OATP1B1. QAW039 is capable of inhibiting 
the OATP drug transporters (OATP1B1: IC50 1.8 µM, OATP1B3: IC50 14 µM and 
OATP2B1: IC50 145 µM, respectively). Of the three, it is the interaction with OATP1B1 
which is of the highest potential importance because it has the lowest margin between the 
IC50 of transporter inhibition and the maximum unbound exposure.  The predicted maximal 
unbound concentration at steady-state following 450 mg q.d. dosing  is 0.363 µM  (90 %CI  
0.174, 0.786) based on a population based pharmacokinetic model using data from 
CQAW0392201, and a protein binding of 88.2 % (DMPK R0800735). The maximal unbound 
steady state concentration relative to the IC50 of OATP1B1 of 1.8 µM ranges from 2 to 10 
fold, with a median of 5 fold. This exceeds the 10-fold recommended margin which suggests 
the need for a DDI study (The International transporter Consortium, 2010). The potential risk 
will be mitigated by moving to a 225 mg b.i.d. dosing regimen when the margin to the IC50 
will increase in the range from 4 to 20 fold (median of 10 fold) where the need for a DDI 
study becomes a borderline requirement. 
As an additional precaution, only patients on low-to-medium statin doses (see section 5.1.2) 
will be allowed to take part in this study. Furthermore, exclusion of patients on statins with 
high baseline CK levels will take place and patients on statin medication who are included in 
the study will have regular monitoring for relevant symptoms and be subject to stopping 
criteria based on persistent myalgia and blood CK levels (Jacobson, 2008). 
Investigative bronchoscopy is considered to be safe in asthmatic subjects (Hattotuwa et al, 
2002) It is well tolerated even in those with severe asthma. Asthma exacerbations are rare and 
reduction in pulmonary function after the procedure is similar to that in subjects with less 
severe asthma (Moore et al, 2011). Professor Brightling’s group has undertaken in excess of 
300 research bronchoscopies at the Glenfield Hospital in Leicester in the last 8 years. Sore 
throat, small amounts of hemoptysis for 24-48h is commonly observed. One of his patients

was admitted over night following bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for observation but no 
treatment was required. BAL will not be performed in CQAW039A2208. None of his subjects 
have had a pneumothorax and they have had no deaths. The use of sedation and local 
anesthetics will be closely controlled and patients will be pre-medicated with bronchodilator 
and will be continuously monitored throughout the procedure. The procedure is therefore 
considered low risk. 
The HRCT scan will expose the patients to a higher dose of radiation than they would 
normally be exposed to, and this may cause a very small increase in the risk of developing 
cancer. Careful radiation logs will be maintained to allow for margins to 10 mSv over 3 years 
exposure limits. Although both inspiratory and expiratory scans are planned, the actual 
numbers of scans performed will be determined in order to maintain an acceptable margin. 
Low radiation dose HRCT scans will be performed for the purpose of this study. Each HRCT 
scan will be equivalent to approximately eight months’ natural radiation exposure in the UK. 
We will closely monitor the radiation dose due to HRCT scans during the course of the study 
and the upper limit of radiation exposure will be equivalent to four years’ natural radiation 
exposure in the UK. 
The natural risk of fatal cancer in the UK population is about 1 in 4. We estimate that the 
amount of additional radiation exposure in this study will increase this risk slightly to 1 in 
3.994 (Health Protection Agency, 2011). 
Given that there is (a) preliminary data for QAW039 and published evidence from a 
competitor compound suggesting that CRTh2 antagonism is efficacious in asthmatic subjects 
(Barnes et al, 2011), (b) that patients with pre-existing heart and/or liver disease will be 
excluded (c) that cardiac and hepatic function will be monitored and (d) that the potential risk 
of statin co-administration is being managed by both CK-based exclusion criteria, lowering 
the QAW039 Cmax levels through  b.i.d. dosing, and restrictions on the statin medication 
dose levels in recruited patients and relevant stopping criteria, Novartis consider both that the 
risks to these patients are modest and the benefit-risk ratio for the patients participating in this 
study is acceptable.

The study population will include male and female symptomatic patients with sputum 
eosinophilia and moderate-to-severe asthma (GINA 2-5) who are incompletely controlled on

Treatment 
5.1 
Protocol requested treatment 
5.1.1 
Investigational treatment 
• Name: QAW039 
• Formulation: hard gelatin capsule 
• Appearance: size - 0, color - pink opaque 
• Unit dose: 2 strengths – 25 and 150 mg 
• Packaging: Blister packs 
QAW039 will be supplied in blister packs of two strengths: 25 mg (3 capsules to be taken 
morning and night) and 150 mg (1 capsule to be taken morning and night). The patients will 
therefore take 225 mg twice daily for the period of the study. 
The placebo is of identical appearance and will be identically packaged. 
5.1.2 
Additional study treatment 
No additional treatment beyond investigational treatment is requested for this trial.

5.1.3 
Treatment arms 
Patients will be assigned to one of the following two treatment arms in a ratio of 1:1. 
• Arm 1: QAW039 225mg (1 capsule of QAW039 150 mg and 3 capsules of QAW039 
25mg) 
• Arm 2: Placebo (1 capsule of Placebo for QAW039 150mg and 3 capsules of Placebo for 
QAW039 25mg) 
5.1.4 
Treatment assignment 
Randomization numbers will be assigned in ascending, sequential order to eligible patients in 
accordance with entry into the study. The randomization numbers will be generated using the 
following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from 
patients and investigator staff. Treatment Allocation Cards will be produced by or under the 
responsibility of Novartis Drug Supply Management using a validated system that automates 
the random assignment of treatment arms to randomization numbers in the specified ratio. The 
randomization scheme for patients will be reviewed and approved by a member of the 
Biostatistics Quality Assurance Group. 
5.1.5 
Treatment blinding 
This is a double-blind study in which medication will be supplied in a single blind fashion 
utilizing an un-blinded pharmacist. Patients and Investigator will remain blinded to the 
treatment allocation during double blind treatment period. During run-in and washout period 
only patients will remain blinded. The active drug (QAW039) will be supplied in blister packs 
of two strengths 25mg and 150mg. The Placebo capsules are of identical appearance and will 
be identically packed. In order to maintain the blind from the patient’s point of view, 
investigators should not divulge information regarding the fact that all individuals will 
be assigned to placebo during the run-in and wash-out phase of the study.

5.2.2 
Dispensing the study treatment 
Study site will be supplied with study drug by Novartis organized in single blinded 
medication kits. Study medication kits comprise cartons containing blisters of Hard Gelatin 
Capsules (HGCs) of QAW039 25mg, QAW039 150mg and Placebo to QAW039.  
All the kits have a 2-part single-blinded label on the outside. Immediately before dispensing a 
kit, the un-blinded investigator staff (un-blinded pharmacist) will detach the tear-off part of 
this label from the packaging and affix it to the source document for that patient’s unique 
patient number.  
Capsules should only be removed from the blister immediately before dosing. 
All blister packs and outer kit cartons must be returned to the site at each of the 
following Visits 3, 4, 5 and 6 (or the final visit for patients who withdraw from the study 
prematurely). 
5.2.3 
Supply, storage and tracking of study treatment 
Study treatment must be received by a designated person (un-blinded pharmacist) at the study 
site, handled and stored safely and properly, and kept in a secured location to which only the 
designated persons have access. Upon receipt, all study drugs should be stored according to 
the instructions specified on the drug labels. Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in 
accordance with the protocol. 
Medication labels will be in English language and comply with the UK legal requirements. 
They will include storage conditions for the drug, but no information about the patient except 
for the subject number. 
The investigator must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of study 
drug in a drug accountability ledger. Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by 
an unblinded monitor during site visits and at the completion of the trial. Patients will be 
asked to return all remaining unused study drug and packaging at the end of the study or at the 
time of study drug discontinuation. 
At the conclusion of the study, and as appropriate during the course of the study, the 
investigator will return all used and unused study drug, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of 
the completed drug accountability ledger to the Novartis monitor or designee or to the 
Novartis address provided in the investigator folder at the site. 
No study medication should be destroyed until completion of the final clinical study report 
and notification is received from the Clinical Trial Head. 
5.2.4 
Instructions for prescribing and taking study treatment 
QAW039 and matching placebo will be provided as oral capsules, equally matched in size, 
shape and color. 
Patients will be instructed to come to the clinic in time to complete pre-dosing assessments 
and to allow QAW039/placebo study medication to be taken as soon as possible thereafter.  
On non-visit days, patients will be instructed to take all four capsules in the morning between 
08:00 and 11:00 from their QAW039/placebo medication kits.

On all days, patients should take their four evening capsules of QAW039/placebo 
approximately 12 hours after their AM dose +/- 30 minutes. 
The investigator should instruct the patient to take the study drug exactly as prescribed and by 
stating that adherence is necessary for the patient’s safety and the validity of the study. The 
patient should be instructed to contact the investigator if he/she is unable for any reason to 
take the study drug as prescribed. 
All used and unused blister kits must be returned by the patient at Visits 3, 4, 5 and 6 (or their 
final visit for patients who withdraw from the study prematurely). 
The date and time of dose administration at each clinic visit (Visits 2-6) will be recorded on 
the Dosage Administration Record CRF.

If any restircted medication is taken in less than the permissible withdrawal time indicated in 
table 5.2.6 prior to spirometry testing, patients will be given another opportunity within the 
next 2 days to undergo spirometry testing with the requirement to withhold from taking any 
restricted medication for the required time periods indicated in table 5.2.6. If patients are 
unable to comply on the second attempt then this will be recorded in the patients’ notes. 
Thereafter, at all subsequent spirometry testing points, patients will be required to withhold 
restricted medication prior to testing in accordance with table 5.2.6. 
All other scheduled visit assessments should continue as planned but the dose and the 
approximate time of taking restricted medication will be captured in the patient’s CRF

5.2.7 
Background therapy 
All patients should keep their background therapy doses unchanged during the course of the 
study. If their background medication needs to be altered, patients should be discontinued 
from the study. Patients may vary the dose of their rescue medication as necessary. 
5.2.8 
Concomitant treatment 
The investigator should instruct the patient to notify the study site about any new medications 
he/she takes after the start of the study drug. All medications and significant non-drug 
therapies (including physical therapy and blood transfusions) administered after the patient 
starts study must be listed on the Concomitant medications/Significant non-drug therapies of 
study CRF. 
5.2.9 
Prohibited treatment 
Each concomitant drug must be individually assessed against all exclusion criteria. If in doubt 
the investigator should contact the Novartis medical monitor or designee before randomizing 
a patient or allowing a new medication to be started. 
5.3 
Discontinuation of study treatment and premature patient 
withdrawal 
Patients may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. They may be 
considered withdrawn if they state an intention to withdraw, fail to return for visits, or become 
lost to follow-up for any other reason. 
If premature withdrawal occurs for any reason, the investigator must make every effort to 
determine the primary reason for a patient’s premature withdrawal from the study and record 
this information on the Study Completion CRF. 
Study treatment must be discontinued and the patient withdrawn from the trial under the 
following circumstances: 
• Withdrawal of informed consent 
• Asthma exacerbation 
• Adverse events for which continued exposure to the study drug would be detrimental 
• Heart rate of >100 b.p.m. measured on 2 occasions, approximately 10 minutes apart, with 
the patient at rest 
• Abnormal laboratory results violate liver function rules: 
a. ALT or AST ≥ 5xULN or 
b. ALT or AST ≥ 2.5xULN and total bilirubin ≥ 1.5xULN 
• Pregnancy 
• If the patient has had excessive use of rescue medication the investigator should asses 
whether it is safe for the patient to continue in the study 
• If patients on statin therapy complain of persistent muscle pain without any obvious cause 
for greater than 3 days accompanied by increase in CK levels > 10 X ULN or persistent 
intolerable muscle pain regardless of the accompanying CK level.

• Unblinding of the study treatment for any reason 
Protocol deviations should not lead to patient withdrawal unless they indicate a significant 
risk to the patient’s safety. 
If premature withdrawal occurs for any reason, the patient should return to the clinic as soon 
as possible for a Premature Subject Withdrawal (PSW) visit. The investigator must make 
every effort to determine the primary reason for a patient’s premature withdrawal from the 
study and record this information on the End of Treatment CRF. 
In addition to these requirements for study drug discontinuation, the investigator should 
discontinue study drug for a given patient if, on balance, he/she believes that continuation 
would be detrimental to the patient’s well-being. 
For patients who are lost to follow-up (i.e. those patients whose status is unclear because they 
fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to withdraw), the investigator should 
show "due diligence" by documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact the 
patient, e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. 
Patients who are prematurely withdrawn from the study will not be replaced by an equal 
number of newly enrolled patients. 
5.4 
 Asthma exacerbations 
Criteria for asthma worsening are based on diary data, clinic visit spirometry, and 
investigators clinical judgment. All the worsening of asthma symptoms considered by the 
investigators to be asthma exacerbation will be captured on the asthma exacerbation episode 
CRF. 
A severe asthma exacerbation is defined as treatment with rescue or increase in maintenance 
systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days (or equivalent) and hospitalization or emergency 
department visit (greater than 24 hours) or death due to asthma. A moderate asthma 
exacerbation is treatment with rescue or increase in maintenance systemic corticosteroids 
either as an outpatient or in emergency department visits (less than or equal to 24 hours). 
Patients who are deemed to have had an exacerbation should either not be enrolled into this 
study (if the exacerbation is in the run-up to randomization) or should be withdrawn from this 
study if the exacerbation occurs during the treatment or washout periods of the study.  
Patients who have had an exacerbation during the run-in period may be screened for study 
entry again at a later stage once a minimum of 6 weeks following recovery has elapsed. 
5.5 
Emergency unblinding of treatment assignment 
Emergency unblinding should only be undertaken when it is essential to treat the patient 
safely and efficaciously. Most often, study drug discontinuation and knowledge of the 
possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study patient who presents with an 
emergency condition. Two sets of emergency code cards are provided to the Novartis Pharma 
Organization. One set is to be retained by the country Pharma Organization (or any entity to 
which this responsibility has been delegated) and one set is to be distributed to the 
investigators. All code break cards must be retained until the end of the study and returned to 
Novartis. They must be stored in a secured place but must be accessible in case of an

emergency. The investigator will receive a masked code break card for each patient, with 
details of the drug treatment covered by a removable, scratch-off cover. In an emergency, the 
scratch-off cover can be removed to determine the treatment. The scratch-off covers are not to 
be removed for any reason except other than an emergency. When the investigator removes a 
scratch-off cover he/she must note the date, time and reason for removing it and retain this 
information with the patient case report form documentation. The unmasking treatment code 
should not be recorded in the patient`s CRF. The investigator must also immediately inform 
the Novartis local monitor or designee that the code has been broken. 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a procedure in place to allow access 
to the code break cards in case of emergency. The investigator will inform the patient how to 
contact his/her backup in cases of emergency when he/she is unavailable.  
Study drug must be discontinued after emergency unmasking. Study drug must also be 
discontinued for any patient whose treatment code has been inadvertently broken or for any 
non-emergency reason. 
5.6 
Study completion and post-study treatment 
Study completion for a patient will occur after he/she has completed 20 weeks of treatment 
(through to Visit 6) or they have prematurely withdrawn. Completion of the study will be 
when all randomized patients have completed 20 weeks of treatment. 
Patients completing the treatment period will not be given further access to study drug 
because the risk/benefit ratio will not yet have been substantiated and there are already other 
marketed therapeutic alternatives available to treat these patients. At the time of study 
completion or early termination, all patients will be placed on the appropriate asthma 
treatment as prescribed by the investigator. 
The investigator must provide follow-up medical care for all patients who are prematurely 
withdrawn from the study, or must refer them for appropriate ongoing care. 
5.7 
Early study termination 
The study can be terminated at any time for any reason by Novartis. Should this be necessary, 
the patient should be seen as soon as possible and treated as described in Section 6 for a 
prematurely withdrawn patient. The investigator may be informed of additional procedures to 
be followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the 
patient’s interests. The investigator will be responsible for informing the relevant ethics 
committees of the early termination of the trial. 
6 
Visit schedule and assessments 
Table 6-1 lists all of the assessments to be performed in the study and indicates with an “x” 
when the visits are performed. 
Patients should be seen for all visits on the designated day or as close to it as possible. 
Patients who discontinue study treatment should also return for the visit indicated by the 
asterisk (*).

a = These assessments will take an average of three separate clinic days to perform. The tests are 
grouped into study days A, B and C (see below). Therefore, they will be spread over a period of at 
most one week that includes the nominal visit date above. The bronchoscopy needs to be performed 
last as there maybe carryover effects for a couple of days on airway inflammation, in particular. Due to 
potential interference between assessments, induced sputum analysis and bronchoscopy cannot be 
performed on consecutive days, but the (A) and (B) study day groupings can be interchanged 
providing there is still a day between sputum and bronchoscopy. 
Study day A: Breath tests, sputum, HRCT (to be performed in this order whenever possible) 
Study day B: He-MRI 
Study day C: Bronchoscopy and biopsy 
b = Subject’s individual levels of radiation exposure will be monitored during the course of the study. 
The maximum allowed radiation dose from research studies will be 10mSv over the course of this and 
all other previous research studies in the previous three years. Patients who are likely to exceed this 
dose will not have further CT scans. These scans will not be performed for female patients who are 
under the age of 30 years 
c = May not be performed on subjects depending on investigator’s assessment of burden of tests 
 
 
A follow-up telephone call will take place approximately 1 month after study completion 
or discontinuation of therapy for any reason. 
6.1 
Information to be collected on screening failures 
Patients discontinuing prior to randomization are considered screening failures. 
If a patient discontinues before starting the study medication (at visit 2), only the demographic 
information, any adverse events or asthma exacerbations plus the related concomitant 
medication and Screening Log entry with the primary reason for screening failure should be 
completed in the CRF. It is not necessary to complete all the required evaluations at the time 
of discontinuation unless medically indicated. 
The following information/demographics will be collected and recorded in the CRF: 
• Subject number 
• Subject’s initials 
• Date of birth 
• Gender 
• Race and ethnicity 
• Primary reason for not continuing

Sputum cell analysis 
Sputum will be induced and assessed for differential cellular content (absolute numbers and 
percentages) as previously described (Pavord et al, 1997). Sputum induction will be 
performed through the inhalation of hypertonic saline. All subjects will have a baseline FEV1 
measured and the procedure stopped if: 
a. The subject’s FEV1 drops by greater than 20% of the post-salbutamol FEV1 baseline 
value

6.4.2 
Spirometry 
All clinic visits for spirometry, body plethysmography and carbon monoxide transfer factor 
will occur in the morning.  
Equipment for spirometry assessments will be provided locally and all measurements will be 
reviewed by trained spirometry technicians or appropriate physicians. Refer to Appendix 3 
Spirometry Guidance, for further details on spirometry testing. Body plethysmography and 
carbon monoxide transfer factor will be performed according to standard ATS / ERS 
guidelines. 
6.4.3 
Oscillometry 
The forced oscillation technique (FOT) will be performed using a commercially available 
impulse oscillometry device, namely the Jaeger MasterScreen Impulse Oscillometry System, 
as well as a specially built device from the University of Nottingham. The device from the 
University of Nottingham will only be used in subjects who undergo MRI. 
The forced oscillation device from the University of Nottingham will be calibrated before 
each test using a standard protocol. Participants will wear a nose clip and oscillations will be 
delivered to their airways by means of a mouthpiece while they breathe slowly. The minimum 
resistance at 2 Hz and 8 Hz will be recorded during deep inspirations performed at the 
instruction of the investigator. 
Impulse oscillometry (IOS) is performed using a commercially-available system, according to 
standard guidelines. This is calibrated daily using a 3-litre syringe and a standard 0.2 kPaL-1s-
1 calibration mesh. Participants wear a nose clip and audible pulses of sound containing a 
range of frequencies from 5-20 Hz are delivered to their airways by means of a mouthpiece 
while they breathe normally. Patients are asked to support their cheeks during the test in order 
to avoid dissipation of the impulses in the mouth. Measures of the frequency-dependence of 
resistance and reactance, designated R5-R20 (resistance at 5 Hz minus resistance at 20 Hz) 
and AX (reactance area) respectively, are calculated by the IOS software. 
6.4.4 
High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) 
All images will be acquired with spirometric gating. Before CT scanning, supine spirometry 
will be performed to obtain supine lung volume measurements (slow vital capacity [SVC], 
inspiratory capacity and expiratory reserve volume). Inspiratory and expiratory CT scans at 
pre-determined SVC (e.g. 80% and 20% SVC) will be obtained. Expiratory scans allow 
quantitative analysis of air trapping and emphysema, while inspiratory scans allow the 
quantification of bronchial wall thickening 
6.4.5 
Multiple Breath Washout (MBW) 
MBW is performed using a modified Innocor gas analyser. Participants wear a nose clip and 
breathe a known concentration (0.2%) of an inert and non-absorbed gas, sulphur hexafluoride 
(SF6), via a mouthpiece connected to the Innocor device, until the concentration in their 
exhaled breath reaches a steady state (the wash-in phase). Participants are then switched to 
breathing room air and encouraged to maintain a steady respiratory frequency of 12 breaths 
per minute and a tidal volume of approximately 1 litre, making use of a real-time display of

these parameters. The concentration of SF6 in exhaled breath is recorded during this ‘wash-
out’ phase until it reaches 1/40 of the original concentration (0.005%). A number of 
parameters are derived from the raw MBW data using custom software, including Scond and 
Sacin. Scond is thought to represent ventilation inhomogeneity arising from conductive 
airway disease, while Sacin represents ventilation inhomogeneity arising from acinar airspace 
disease. 
6.4.6 
Hyperpolarized Helium-3 MRI Imaging (He-3 MRI) 
6.4.6.1 
3He Hyperpolarization 
3He will be hyperpolarized on site in Sheffield with regulatory approved (UK-MAIMP-
29724) equipment and administered through a Tedlar bag. 3He will be delivered in 300-400 
ml doses according to total lung capacity made up to one liter with 600-700 ml nitrogen.  
6.4.6.1.1 3He MRI 
Patients will be placed inside a custom 3He body coil inside the 1.5T magnet and the 
following 3He MRI pulse sequences will be acquired with sensitivity to: (i) static breathold 
ventilation heterogeneity, (ii) Apparent Diffusion Coefficient mapping and (iii) dynamic gas 
flow and washout.  
a. A low flip angle 3D gradient echo sequence will be used to image ventilation distribution. 
Images will be acquired during a 13 second breath hold following inhalation of the gas 
from FRC. This exam will be performed twice in the first session as a means of 
assessment of baseline repeatability of ventilated volume.  
b. ADC images will be acquired with simultaneous ventilation images for spatial registration 
to the ventilation images described above. ADC images will be processed and the results 
will also be presented as spatial ADC maps for comparison with HRCT and in histogram 
format. 
c. 3D dynamic images of gas inflow and washout will be acquired with a time resolved 
sequence and the washout time constants will be derived for comparison with MBW. 
6.4.6.1.2 1H lung MRI 
1H lung MRI (anatomy and contrast enhanced Gd-DTPA perfusion scans) will also be 
performed.

6.4.7 
Bronchial Biopsies and Brushings 
Patients are placed into the supine or semi-recumbent position and venous access is inserted. 
The patient receives premedication (e.g. midazolam 0.07 mg/kg). Oxygen levels are 
monitored and oxygen supplementation is provided. The throat and larynx area is 
anaesthetized with a local anesthetic spray (lidocaine, max dose 20 puffs = 3mg/kg) and a 
flexible endoscope is introduced. After initial orientation and documentation of appearance of 
the airways, brushings and endobronchial biopsies will be taken from the right main bronchus 
and segmental and sub-segmental bronchi. The brushes are cut off and transferred into a 15 ml 
V-tube (polypropylene) containing 2 ml RNA protect reagent or culture medium. The

bronchial biopsies will be placed in normal saline, PFA (paraformaldehyde) or PMSF 
(phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride) as appropriate.  After the procedure patients will remain 
under medical supervision for 2 hours. 
6.4.8 
Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) 
In this study, the ACQ will be used to assess improvements in asthma symptom control. The 
ACQ was originally validated in patients with asthma aged 17 to 90 years (Juniper 1999, 
2005), and is one of several asthma control measures recommended by GINA Guidelines. The 
ACQ consists of 7 items: 5 items on symptom assessment, 1 item on rescue bronchodilator 
use, and 1 item on airway caliber (FEV1 % predicted). The ACQ has been fully validated, 
including a minimal important difference (MID) or smallest change that can be considered 
clinically important (0.5). The ACQ will be self-administered at the clinic (questions 1-6 
only) and it only takes a few minutes to complete. Patients are asked how they have been 
feeling during the past week and to score each item on a 7-point response scale, where 0 
indicates ‘totally controlled’ and 6 indicates ‘severely uncontrolled.’ Study staff score 
question 7 based on % predicted FEV1 (ideally pre-bronchodilator). The total score is 
calculated as the mean of all questions. The questionnaire should always be completed before 
any other assessments.  
A SAMPLE of the Asthma Control Questionnaire is included in Appendix 4. 
6.4.9 
Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire – Standardized (AQLQs) 
In this study, the disease-specific, standardized version of the asthma quality of life 
questionnaire (AQLQs) will be used to measure health-related quality of life in trial patients. 
The measure was originally validated for use in patients with asthma aged 17 to 70 years 
(Juniper et al, 1999). The AQLQs is a 32-item questionnaire designed to measure functional 
impairments that are most important to patients with asthma. It consists of 4 domains: 
symptoms, emotional function, environmental stimuli and activity limitation. Full validation 
has been demonstrated, including a minimal important difference (MID) or smallest change 
that can be considered clinically important (0.5). The AQLQs will be self-administered at the 
clinic and takes about 4 to 5 minutes to complete. Given that the AQLQs will be administered 
along with the ACQ, which has a 1-week recall, patients completing the AQLQs will also be 
asked to recall their experiences during the past week, and to score each item on a 7- point 
scale (7 = not at all impaired to 1 = severely impaired). The AQLQs yields domain-specific 
scores and a total score, which is the mean response to all 32 questions. The questionnaire 
should always be completed before any other non-PRO assessments.  
A SAMPLE of the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire is included in Appendix 5. 
6.4.10 
Volatile Organic Compounds 
Testing is performed using bespoke equipment loaned from Loughborough University. 
Subjects are asked to refrain from applying cosmetics on the day of the test. Subjects wear a 
tight-fitting mask supplied with air and with a sample tube attached, and breathe normally 
until 2.5 L of exhaled breath are collected through the sample tube. Sample tubes are sent to 
Loughborough University for analysis (Ibrahim et al, 2011). This procedure may not be

performed for some patients if it becomes necessary to reduce the burden of tests on these 
patients. 
6.4.11 
Fraction of Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO50) 
Exhaled Nitric Oxide is widely accepted as a non-invasive marker for airway inflammation. 
Fractional exhaled nitric oxide will be measured following the recently published guidelines 
on standardized techniques including calibration of equipment as appropriate for measuring 
exhaled Nitric Oxide by ATS and ERS (ATS/ERS guidelines 2005). 
To ensure consistency in the measurement of FeNO, all sites will be provided with a NIOX 
MINO FeNO machine. 
Recommendations for FeNO Measurements 
FeNO measurements should be performed PRIOR to spirometry assessments, as spirometric 
manoeuvres have been shown to transiently reduce exhaled NO levels. 
FeNO measurements have to be performed at the same time of day (preferably within 4 hours 
of rising). 
Repeated, reproducible exhalations should be performed to obtain two measurements within 
10% of each other. Exhaled NO is the mean of these two values. The duration of exhalation 
must be sufficient (up to 10 seconds) to achieve a stable NO plateau. 
Allow subjects at least 30 seconds of relaxed tidal breathing to rest between repeated 
exhalations in order not to exhaust the patient. 
The patient should be seated comfortably with the equipment at the proper height and position. 
Patients should refrain from eating and drinking at least 2 hours before measurements. 
Patients should avoid strenuous exercise for 1 hour before measurements. 
The time of last bronchodilator should be noted, as FeNO levels may vary with the degree of 
airway obstruction or after bronchodilation. 
Respiratory tract infections may lead to increased levels of exhaled NO in asthma, therefore 
the infection should be recorded in the patient’s medical file (and as an AE in the CRF). 
Breath-hold results in NO accumulation which causes NO peaks in the exhalations profiles of 
NO versus time and should therefore be discouraged. 
6.4.12 
Appropriateness of efficacy assessments 
The spirometry, patient reported outcome measures, sputum assessments and exhaled NO 
measurements are typical of a study of this type. The other, more exploratory measures, of 
lung histology, pulmonary function and imaging as well as systemic protein and mRNA 
measurements are part of attempt to gain a holistic understanding of how the immunology, 
genetics and pathology impact upon lung function and, ultimately, on patient symptomatology 
and disease progression in asthma.  
We are collaborating with the AIRPROM initiative, through Professors Brightling & Wild, 
which is attempting to build an in silico model of asthma to better predict how insults and 
therapies might impact the course of patients’ disease.

neck (including thyroid), eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, 
extremities, vascular and neurological. If indicated based on medical history and/or symptoms, 
rectal, external genitalia, breast, and pelvic exams will be performed  
Information for all physical examinations must be included in the source documentation at the 
study site. Significant findings that are present prior to informed consent being granted must 
be included in the Relevant Medical History/Current Medical Conditions screen on the 
patient’s CRF. Significant findings made after informed consent is given which meet the 
definition of an Adverse Event must be recorded on the Adverse Event screen of the patient’s 
CRF. 
6.5.2 
Vital Signs 
Vital signs include body temperature, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
and pulse measurements. After the patient has been sitting for five minutes, with back 
supported and both feet placed on the floor, systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be 
measured. Patient’s condition must be monitored to rule out any clinically relevant arrhythmia 
or tachycardia.

6.6.1 
Pharmacokinetics 
All subjects will have one blood sample at Visit 4 and two blood samples collected for 
pharmacokinetic analysis on Visit 5. At Visit 4 a sample will be taken prior to the morning 
dose. At Visit 5, one sample will be taken before the administration of the morning dose of 
the study drug and the second sample will be taken 3 hours after the administration of the 
study drug. Each sample will be processed to produce 2 aliquots of acidified plasma (A and 
B).  All samples will be given a unique sample number (as listed in the PK blood log in 
Appendix 2) and a collection number. The site is to ensure the correct sample number is 
reflected on the respective tube. Both the date and time of that morning’s (either day 42 or day 
84) study drug dose administration and the actual PK sample collection date and time will be 
entered on the PK blood collection page of the CRF. Sampling problems will be commented 
on in the CRFs. 
Both aliquots per timepoint, aliquot A and aliquot B should be shipped to the central 
laboratory (and then forwarded to the bioanalytical facility for sample analysis on separate 
occasion). 
Biofluid concentrations will be expressed in mass per volume units. All concentrations below 
the limit of quantification or missing data will be labeled as such in the concentration data 
listings. Concentrations below the Limit of Quantification will be treated as zero in summary 
statistics for concentration data only. They will not be considered for calculation of PK 
Parameters (with the exception of the pre-dose samples).

6.6.2 
Biomarkers 
As part of an effort to determine whether biomarkers that predict clinical efficacy responses 
can be identified, the following samples will be collected in this trial. 
Sample testing and collection procedures for the biomarkers identified in this section are 
described in greater detail in the central lab manual, which will be provided as part of this 
study. 
6.6.2.1 
Pharmacogenetic Assessments 
The Study includes an optional pharmacogenetic component which requires a separate 
signature if the subject agrees to participate. It is required as part of this protocol that the 
Investigator presents these options to the subject. 
Exploratory pharmacogenetics research studies are planned as a part of this study with the 
objectives of identifying inherited genetic factors which may influence the response to 
QAW039. These genetic factors include those that may (1) be related to asthma, (2) predict 
response to treatment with QAW039, (3) predict relative susceptibility to drug-drug 
interactions, or (4) predict genetic predisposition to side effects. The hope is to develop a 
better understanding of how subjects respond to QAW039. 
Polymorphisms that may be studied relating to the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion (ADME) of QAW039 may include UGT1A1 and other UGT polymorphisms. 
Despite continuing advances in genetics research, not all of the polymorphisms relevant to 
drug metabolism and drug action may have been identified. Therefore, additional 
polymorphisms will be added within the restricted scope of these studies as described above. 
In addition, recent advances in genotyping technologies have made genome-wide association 
(GWA) studies possible. GWA studies may also be undertaken within the restricted scope of 
these studies as described above. 
Sample collection: One 10 mL blood sample will be collected at Day 1 (Visit 3) in an EDTA 
tube. After collection, the sample must be inverted several times to prevent clotting. If the 
blood draw at Visit 3 is missed, the sample should be taken at the next visit that a blood draw 
is already scheduled. 
The samples should be kept frozen at -70°C until shipped frozen to the central lab for DNA 
extraction. The extracted DNA will then be transferred to Novartis for pharmacogenetic 
analysis and storage. 
Any DNA derived from the sample that remains after analysis may be stored for up to 15years 
to address scientific questions related to QAW039 or asthma. 
In the event that a subject requests to destroy the pharmacogenetic sample, the following 
process should be followed: (1) the subject should contact the investigator; (2) the investigator

will then provide the sponsor with the required study and subject numbers; (3) any remaining

Transcriptomic assessments 
Messenger RNA expression profiling will be carried-out in enrolled asthma patients who are 
willing to participate in this exploratory biomarker evaluation from both blood and/or biopsy 
or brushing material. Exploratory pharmacogenomic assessments in this study aim at 
increasing our understanding of the molecular heterogeneity of asthma, and at identifying 
predictors of response to treatment.  
RNA samples will be profiled using the Illumina Human HT-12 v3 Expression BeadChip or 
equivalent. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) will be used to identify differentially 
expressed genes, and statistical clustering techniques will be used to analyze the dataset. 
Genotyping will be performed using the Illumina 660W genotyping array that contains 
660000 polymorphisms (SNPs and CNVs) evenly spread across the human genome, or an 
equivalent. This data will contribute towards genome-wide association studies of asthma 
phenotypes. One serum sample per patient - to be prepared from 10.0 mL whole blood - will 
be collected pre-dose at Visit 3 and at Visit 5 and Visit 6. 
These samples will be stored at the central lab until onward shipment for genomic data 
generation and analysis. Exploratory biomarker clinical samples remaining after analysis may 
be stored for up to 15 years to address additional relevant scientific questions. 
6.6.2.3 
Serum and plasma proteins 
Serum proteins will be measured both to see if they might identify populations who are more 
likely to respond to QAW039 than the total population and to see if changes in concentration 
correlate with response: these may include but are not limited to eosinophilic cationic protein 
(ECP), eotaxin-1, IL-5, IL-13, serum total IgE, hsCRP, TNF-α, MCP-1 and IL-8. Samples 
will be collected at before the commencement of treatment at Visit 3 and Visits 4, 5 and 6. 
A sample will be taken at baseline for potential autoantibody measurement to rule out any 
pre-existing autoimmune condition (in particular Churg-Strauss Syndrome) should that prove 
necessary. 
6.6.2.4 
Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) 
A FACS assay will be used to quantify the following cell populations (at least): CD3; CD4; 
CD8; CCR3 (gating of eosinophils); CRTh2. These will be measured in all patients at Visits 3, 
4, 5 and 6. 
6.6.2.5 
Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes 
Analytes that will be measured may include but are not limited to PGD2, PGE2, PGJ2, 
DKPGD2, ∆12-PGD2, 15d-PGD2, ∆12-PGJ2, 9α,11β-PGF2, LTB4, LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4.

The prostaglandins will be measured by LC-MS in all patients at Visits 3, 4, 5 and 6. 
6.6.2.6 
Sputum soluble factor analysis 
Sputum may be assessed (from visit 3 onwards) for soluble factor levels (potentially including 
but not limited to IgE, Eotaxin-1, IL-5, IL-13, IL-8, ECP, prostaglandins and leukotrienes and 
TNF-α).

Safety monitoring 
7.1 
Adverse Events 
An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or 
medical condition occurring after starting the study even if the event is not considered to be 
related to study drug. Study drug includes the investigational drug under evaluation and the 
placebo that is given during any phase of the study. Medical conditions/diseases present 
before starting the study are only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting the 
study. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce 
clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require therapy. 
The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by non-directive questioning of the patient 
at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered 
by the patient during or between visits or through physical examination, laboratory test, or 
other assessments. All adverse events must be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF with the 
following information: 
1. the severity grade [mild, moderate, severe] 
2. its relationship to the study drug(s) (suspected/not suspected) 
3. its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam) 
4. whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE) 
An SAE is defined as an event which: 
• is fatal or life-threatening 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless 
hospitalization is for: 
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition 
• elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug 
• treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission

• social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the patient’s 
general condition 
• is medically significant, i.e. defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special 
reporting requirements; see Section 7.2. 
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Treatment may include one or more of the 
following: no action taken (i.e. further observation only); study drug dosage 
adjusted/temporarily interrupted; study drug permanently discontinued due to this adverse   
event; concomitant medication given; non-drug therapy given; patient hospitalized/patient’s 
hospitalization prolonged. The action taken to treat the adverse event should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event CRF. 
Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is 
judged to be permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if 
necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the 
interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. 
Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be 
found in the Investigator Brochure (IB) or will be communicated between IB updates in the 
form of Investigator Notifications. This information will be included in the patient informed 
consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed. 
7.2 
Serious adverse event reporting 
To ensure patient safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring after the 
patient has provided informed consent and until 30 days after the patient has stopped study 
participation (defined as time of last dose of study drug taken or last visit whichever is later) 
must be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. 
Any SAEs experienced after this 30 day period should only be reported to Novartis if the 
investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study drug. 
Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be reported as 
follow-up to the original episode, regardless of when the event occurs. This report must be 
submitted within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow-up information. An SAE 
that is considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be reported 
separately as a new event. 
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form. The investigator must assess the relationship of any SAE to study drug, complete the 
SAE Report Form in English, and send the completed, signed form by fax within 24 hours to 
the local Novartis Drug Safety and Epidemiology Department. The telephone and telecopy 
number of the contact persons in the local department of Clinical Safety and Epidemiology, 
specific to the site, are listed in the investigator folder provided to the site. The original copy 
of the SAE Report Form and the fax confirmation sheet must be kept with the case report 
form documentation at the study site.

Follow-up information is sent to the same person to whom the original SAE Report Form was 
sent, using a new SAE Report Form stating that this is a follow-up to the previously reported 
SAE and giving the date of the original report. The follow-up information should describe 
whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was 
broken or not, and whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation. 
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert 
(new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the Novartis study drug, a Drug Safety and 
Epidemiology Department associate may urgently require further information from the 
investigator for Health Authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator 
Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this 
SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be 
collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in 
accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national regulatory requirements in 
participating countries. 
7.3 
Pregnancies 
To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy in a patient on study drug must be reported to 
Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up 
to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, 
and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or 
newborn complications. 
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form and reported by the 
investigator to the local Novartis Drug Safety and Epidemiology Department. Pregnancy 
follow-up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the 
possible relationship to the Novartis study drug of any pregnancy outcome. Any SAE 
experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report Form.

Data Review and database management 
8.1 
Site Monitoring 
Before study initiation, a Novartis representative will review the protocol and CRFs with the 
investigators and their staff at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting. 
During the study, the field monitor will visit the site regularly to check the completeness of 
patient records, the accuracy of entries on the CRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to 
Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study drug is being 
stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be 
available to assist the field monitor during these visits. 
The investigator must maintain source documents for each patient in the study, consisting of 
case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records) containing demographic and medical 
information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or 
assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the 
patient's file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by 
the patient (a signed copy is given to the patient). 
This document (090095a883f936b3 in docbase CREDI_BS) has been digitally signed with external signatures using Entrust PKI.

The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm 
their consistency with the CRF entries. Novartis monitoring standards require full verification 
for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
documentation of SAEs, and the recording of data that will be used for all primary and safety 
variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs are 
performed according to the study-specific monitoring plan. No information in source 
documents about the identity of the patients will be disclosed. 
8.2 
Data Collection 
Designated investigator staff will enter the data required by the protocol into Case Report 
Forms.  The Investigator must certify that the data entered into the Case Report Forms are 
complete and accurate. After database lock, the investigator will receive a CD-ROM or paper 
copies of the patient data for archiving at the investigational site. 
8.3 
Database management and quality control 
Novartis staff or designee review the data entered into the CRFs by investigational staff for 
completeness and accuracy and instruct the site personnel to make any required corrections or 
additions. 
1. Queries are sent to the investigational site using a data query.  
2. Designated investigator site staff is/are required to respond to the query and confirm or 
correct the data using a paper Data Query Form which will be faxed to the site.  
3. Site personnel will complete and sign the faxed copy and fax it back to Novartis staff or 
designee who will make the correction to the database.  
4. The signed copy of the Data Query Form is kept at the investigator site. 
Concomitant medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug 
Reference List, which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. 
Medical history/current medical conditions and adverse events will be coded using the 
Medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) terminology. 
Laboratory samples (except cytology for sputum samples and bronchial brushings and 
biopsies) will be processed centrally and the results will be sent to Novartis (or a designated 
CRO). 
ECG readings will be processed locally, at the study site and the results will be sent to 
Novartis (or a designated CRO).  
Spirometry and FeNO readings will be processed and the results will be sent to Novartis (or a 
designated CRO). 
To maximize confidentiality, all pharmacogenetic samples and the information associated 
with the samples will be double-coded to prevent the exposure of the subject’s information 
and identity. This double-coding process allows Novartis to go back and destroy the sample at 
the subject’s request. In addition, sample information is stored in one secured database while 
genetic data is stored in an independent secured database.

Data analysis 
9.1 
Analysis sets. 
The randomized set (RAN), which comprises all randomized patients, regardless of whether 
or not they actually received study medication, will be used for summaries of patient 
disposition and analysis populations.   
The full analysis set (FAS) will include all randomized patients who received at least one dose 
of study drug. Following the intent-to-treat principle, patients will be analyzed according to 
the treatment they were assigned to at randomization. FAS will be used for all efficacy 
variables, unless otherwise stated. 
The per-protocol set (PP) will include all patients in the FAS without any major protocol 
deviations. Major protocol deviations will be defined in the validation analysis plan prior to 
database lock and the un-blinding of the study. Patients will be analyzed according to the 
treatment they were assigned to. PP will be used for the supportive analysis of the primary 
variable. 
The safety set (SAF) will include all patients who received at least one dose of study drug 
whether or not being randomized.  Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they 
received. The safety set will be used in the analysis of all safety variables. 
Note that the FAS and safety set are the same except that the safety set allows the inclusion of 
non-randomized patients who receive study drug in error. Also the FAS assigns randomized 
treatment and the safety set assigns received treatment. 
9.2 
Patient demographics and other baseline characteristics 
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized using the safety set including 
age, gender, race, ethnicity, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), duration of asthma, 
smoking history, screening spirometry (% predicted FEV1, reversibility, etc.), vital signs 
(systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate), concomitant medications, ECG, hematology, 
blood chemistry, urinalysis, autoantibodies, and relevant medical histories. 
9.3 
Treatments (study drug, rescue medication, other concomitant 
therapies, compliance) 
The number of patients and the length of time (in days) exposed to each study drug will be 
summarized by treatment for the safety set. 
Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized by treatment for the safety set 
separated for asthma related and non-asthma related medications. Asthma related concomitant 
medications will be summarized by pre-specified categories, route of administration and 
preferred term. Non-asthma related concomitant medications will be summarized by the 
preferred term.

Treatment compliance will be summarized by treatment for the safety set. 
9.4 
Analysis of the primary and key secondary variable(s) 
The FAS (Full Analysis Set) will be used for analysis of the primary and secondary variables, 
unless otherwise specified. 
9.4.1 
Variable(s) 
9.4.1.1 
Primary Variable 
The primary variable of the study is the change from baseline in sputum eosinophil percentage 
at week 12. As sputum eosinophil percentage has been found to follow a log-normal 
distribution, the analysis will be based on log10-transformed scale. The baseline measurement 
is defined as sputum eosinophil percentage at Visit 3 (Day 1) prior to the first dosing (on 
log10-transformed scale). 
9.4.1.2 
Secondary variable 
The secondary variables include the change from baseline to week 12 in ACQ. The baseline is 
defined as the assessment measured at Visit 3 (Day 1) prior to the first dosing. 
ACQ 
The ACQ measures asthma symptom control and consists of 7 items: 5 on symptom 
assessment, 1 on rescue bronchodilator use and 1 on airway calibre (FEV1 % predicted). All 7 
questions of the ACQ are equally weighted. Items 1-6 are scored along a 7-point response 
scale, where 0 = good controlled and 6 = poor controlled. The 7th item on % predicted FEV1 
(pre-bronchodilator) is scored by clinic staff on a 7-point scale (0 – > 95%; 1 – 90-95%; 2 – 
80-89%; 3 – 70-79%; 4 – 60-69%; 5 – 50-59%; 6 – < 50%). The average score of the 7 
questions at each visit will be calculated as the sum of scores divided by the number of 
questions that were answered by the patient at the visit, as long as there were at least 6 
questions answered and the missing item is neither question 1 nor question 7. 
9.4.2 
Statistical model, hypothesis, and method of analysis 
The primary variable and the secondary variables will be summarized by treatment and 
analyzed using an ANCOVA model with treatment as the fixed effect and the respective 
baseline value as the covariate.  
Least square mean for each respective treatment group and for the treatment difference will be 
presented along with associated 95% confidence interval and p-value (2-sided) for within and 
between group comparisons. 
9.4.3 
Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations 
Missing data will be imputed for the primary variable using last observation carried forward 
(LOCF). Only post-baseline observation will be used for this purpose. 
Only 1 missing item is allowed for scoring the ACQ and, preferably, this should not be 
question 1 or question 7.  The single missing value may be interpolated by utilizing prior or 
subsequent completions of the questionnaire.  The averaged ACQ score will not be imputed.

9.4.4 
Supportive analyses 
9.4.4.1 
Primary Variable 
For the primary variable, the analysis will be repeated for the patients in FAS without LOCF. 
Longitudinal data analysis will be performed as sensitivity analysis on the primary variable in 
the FAS, as an alternative to LOCF. Treatment effects, together with 95% confidence interval 
for difference in treatments at each visit will be presented. 
The normality assumption will be checked with a Q-Q plot of residuals for each treatment 
group. In addition, within-treatment difference between baseline and week 12 will be 
analyzed using Wilcoxon paired sample signed-rank test; between-treatment comparison on 
the change from baseline to week 12 will be analyzed using Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney rank-
sum test. 
9.4.4.2 
Secondary Variable 
For the secondary variable, additional analyses will be conducted as follows:  
• An ACQ change of 0.5 has been validated as the minimally important clinical difference 
(Juniper et al, 2005). The proportion of patients with a decrease in ACQ of > 0.5 will be 
summarized by treatment and analyzed using a logistic regression. The model includes 
terms for treatment as the fixed effect and the baseline ACQ score as a covariate. The odds 
ratio of QAX576/Placebo will be computed, along with associated 95% confidence 
intervals. 
• A sensitivity analysis using different imputation algorithms for missing data at week 12 
will be performed in the FAS. 
• Longitudinal data analysis will be also performed in the FAS to account for the 
dependency among the visits within patient. Treatment effects, together with 95% 
confidence interval for difference in treatments at each visit will be presented. 
9.5 
Analysis of other variables 
9.5.1 
Efficacy variables 
9.5.1.1 
Sputum cell analysis 
The change from baseline at week 6 and at week 18 will be also summarized by treatment and 
analyzed using an ANCOVA model with treatment as the fixed effect and the baseline sputum 
eosinophil percentage as the covariate. The normality assumption will be checked with a Q-Q 
plot of residuals for each treatment group and if this is not adequately met a non-parametric 
test will be used instead (refer to Section 9.4.4.1).   
To explore the persistency of efficacious effect following the cessation of therapy, data will 
be also analyzed similarly based on change from week 12 to week 18.

Asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) 
The change from baseline at week 6 and at week 18 and the change from week 12 and week 
18 will be summarized and analyzed similarly with baseline ACQ as the covariate. Refer to 
Section 9.5.1.1. 
9.5.1.3 
Pulmonary function tests 
9.5.1.3.1 Spirometry 
% predicted FEV1 (pre-bronchodilator) is calculated as:   
100 x   FEV1 (pre β2-agonists at V2) 
                         Predicted FEV1  
The change from baseline to week 6, week, 12, and week 18 in % predicted FEV1 will be 
summarized and analyzed in a similar way as described in Section 9.5.1.1 with baseline % 
predicted FEV1 as the covariate. To explore the persistency of efficacious effect following the 
cessation of therapy, data will be also analyzed similarly based on change from week 12 to 
week 18. 
9.5.1.3.2 Impulse Oscillometry 
R5-R20 (kPaL-1s-1) and AX (kPaL-1) are measured with impulse oscillometry. The change 
from baseline at week 12 and at week 18 and the change from week 12 and week 18 will be 
summarized and analyzed similarly with the respective baseline value as the covariate. Refer 
to Section 9.5.1.1. 
9.5.1.3.3 Multiple Breath Washout (MBW) 
Sacin (L-1) is measured with multiple breath washout. The change from baseline at week 12 and 
at week 18 and the change from week 12 and week 18 will be summarized and analyzed 
similarly with the respective baseline value as the covariate. Refer to Section 9.5.1.1. 
9.5.2 
Safety variables 
All safety endpoints (i.e. adverse events, laboratory data, vital signs, and ECG) will be 
summarized by treatment for all patients of the safety population. All data will be included in 
the analysis regardless of rescue medication use. 
9.5.2.1 
Adverse events 
All adverse events which start after the first dose of study medication will be considered as a 
treatment emergent adverse event. Adverse events that start during the study but before the 
time of the first dose of study drug (e.g. screening period) will be classified as a prior adverse 
event and will be included in adverse events listings, but will not be summarized.  
Treatment emergent adverse events with the number and percentage of patients having any 
adverse event overall, by system organ class and preferred term will be provided for:  
• all adverse events 
• adverse events by maximum severity

9.5.2.2 
Laboratory data 
A central laboratory will be used to analyze and report blood chemistry/hematology/urinalysis 
The following analyses will be performed, where appropriate, for central measurements of 
hematology and blood chemistry tests: 
• standard descriptive statistics for values measured at baseline and post-baseline visits 
including changes from baseline 
• shift tables relative to the normal ranges between baseline and post-baseline visits 
• number (and percentage) of patients with clinically notable changes for selected tests 
9.5.2.3 
Vital signs 
Vital signs (i.e. blood pressure and pulse rate) will be summarized with standard descriptive 
statistics of raw data and changes from baseline for each visit separately.  The numbers of 
patients with vital signs meeting the definition of notably abnormal will be presented by 
parameter.   
9.5.2.4 
Electrocardiogram 
The ECGs will be read for quantitative assessments including (RR, PR, QRS and QT intervals, 
and heart rate) and qualitative diagnoses. The QTc will be calculated from the QT interval and 
RR (in seconds) by two methods: 
(1) Using Bazett’s formula: QTc = QT/√ RR 
(2) Using Fridericia’s formula: QTc = QT / 3√ RR, where 3√ denotes the cube root 
The quantitative assessments will be based on the mean of the measurements at each 
scheduled time point for each visit separately. The analysis, such as change from baseline and 
clinical notables, will be summarized by treatment based on the averaged values. The baseline 
measurement will be the mean of measurement at Visit 4 pre-dose (-35 min).   
Changes from baseline will be summarized by treatment for the mean heart rate and ECG 
intervals including QTc for each scheduled time point at each visit and for the maximum post-
baseline value. 
Notable QTc values will be summarized.  A notable value is defined as a QTc interval of 
greater than 450 msec for males and greater than 470 msec females.  Patients meeting a more 
extreme notable criterion of >500 msec will be also summarized for males and females. The 
notable change in QTc will be also summarized. The categories used for the change in QTc 
are less than 30 msec, 30 to 60 msec and greater than 60 msec. 
The qualitative assessment includes overall ECG interpretation and Morphological and 
rhythm abnormalities. Shift tables will be provided in order to compare a patient’s baseline 
overall ECG interpretation to the interpretation at each time point at each post-baseline visit.

Using the morphologic determinations, the number and percentage of patients with qualitative 
ECG abnormality will be summarized for each visit and each timepoint. The abnormality will 
be summarized by baseline condition (NO/YES) for each type of abnormality (i.e. newly 
occurring cases, or persistent/recurrent cases). The qualitative ECG abnormality will be 
determined by abnormality of Rhythm, Arrhythmia, Conduction, Morphology, Myocardial 
infarction, ST segment, T wave abnormalities, abnormal U wave.

Resource utilization 
Healthcare resource utilization will not be collected in this study.

Health-related Quality of Life 
9.5.4.1 
Asthma control questionnaire (AQLQs) 
See section 9.4. 
9.5.4.2 
Asthma quality of life (AQLQs) 
The 32 items in the AQLQ(s) are divided into four domain-specific scores and a total score as 
follows:  
Activity limitations = Mean of Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 19, 25, 28, 31, 32 (11 items) 
Symptoms = Mean of Items 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 29, 30 (12 items) 
Emotional function = Mean of Items 7, 13, 15, 21, 27 (5 items) 
Environmental stimuli = Mean of Items 9, 17, 23, 26 (4 items) 
Overall Score = Mean of Items 1 to 32 (32 items) 
Each item of the AQLQ is equally weighted and scored along a 7-point scale, where 1 
indicates maximal impairment and 7 indicates no impairment. Thus, higher scores indicate 
better asthma-related HRQOL. There is a mean score calculated for each of the four domains, 
as well as an overall quality-of-life score, which is the mean score of all 32 items. The 
resultant overall scores will be between 1 and 7. 
The developer suggests no more than 10% of missing data. This means no more than 3 
missing responses for the overall score and no more than 1 missing response per domain.  For 
the symptoms and activity domain scores, one missing value per domain is allowed.  For the 
emotional function and environmental stimuli domain scores, no missing values are allowed.  
The minimal important difference (MID), defined as "the smallest difference in score which 
patients perceive as beneficial and would mandate, in the absence of troublesome side effects 
and excessive cost, a change in the patients management," has been established as 0.5 points 
per item (Juniper et al, 2006).  
Between treatments analyses of change from baseline scores by visit will be performed using 
the same model as specified in section 9.4.2 with baseline AQLQ score as the covariate. Least 
squares means and associated 95% confidence intervals will be presented for treatments and 
treatment differences.

Pharmacokinetics 
All subjects with evaluable pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter data will be included in the 
pharmacokinetic data analysis. 
Pharmacokinetic variables 
Biofluid concentrations will be expressed in mass per volume units. All concentrations below 
the limit of quantification or missing data will be labeled as such in the concentration data 
listings. Concentrations below the Limit of Quantification will be treated as zero in summary 
statistics for concentration data only. They will not be considered for calculation of PK 
Parameters (with the exception of the pre-dose samples). 
PK samples are being collected to assess patient compliance with the dosage regimen 
therefore due to the sparse nature of the sample collection scheme pharmacokinetic 
parameters will not be determined using non-compartmental method(s). Descriptive statistics 
of plasma concentrations data will include mean, SD, and CV, min and max. 
9.5.6 
Pharmacogenetics/pharmacogenomics 
9.5.6.1 
Pharmacogenetic data analyses 
The exploratory pharmacogenetic studies are designed to investigate the association between 
genetic factors (genotypes) and clinical assessments (phenotypes) which are collected during 
the clinical trial. Without prior evidence of a strong association, a number of possible 
associations are evaluated with exploratory analyses.  A range of statistical tests (chi-square 
tests, ANCOVAs, linear and logistic regression) are used for the analyses.  Additional data, 
from subsequent clinical trials, are often needed to confirm associations. Alternatively, if the 
numbers of subjects enrolled in the study are too small to complete proper statistical analyses, 
these data may be combined, as appropriate, with those from other studies to enlarge the data 
set for analysis. 
9.5.6.2 
Pharmacogenomic data analyses  
The analysis of pharmacogenomic data will be performed at the Fundacio Privada Parc, 
Cientfic DE, Barcelona, Spain. Quality control of all individual samples and molecular data 
will be conducted. The analysis of genomic data per se may be assisted by the use of “in 
house’ and commercial expert applications and databases. A range of statistics-based 
approaches - both supervised and unsupervised - will be applied to the data. 
9.5.7 
Biomarkers 
9.5.7.1 
Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) 
Exhaled Nitric Oxide is a non-invasive marker for airway inflammation. It will be measured 
following the recently published guidelines on standardized techniques.  
The change from baseline will be summarized by treatment group. The mean FeNO as 
calculated from two measurements will be used for analysis. Treatment group comparisons 
will be performed by the same model as specified in Section 9.5.1.1 with baseline FeNO as

for treatments and treatment differences.   
9.5.7.2 
Other efficacy biomarkers 
Other efficacy biomarkers are measured, including 
• High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) 
• Hyperpolarized Helium-3 MRI Imaging (He-3 MRI) 
• Bronchial Biopsies and Brushings 
• Volatile Organic Compounds 
Data will be summarized and analyzed in a similar way as described in section 9.5.1.1. 
9.5.8 
PK/PD 
Population modeling may be undertaken to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of QAW039 based 
on the sparse data collected in this study as well as in other clinical studies from the QAW039 
program. A search may be performed to identify variables that impact PK. This will include, 
but is not limited to, an investigation of patient demographics and other baseline 
characteristics. Results from such population analyses will be reported separately.  
PK/PD modeling may also be attempted for exploratory purposes.  
9.6 
Interim analyses 
An interim analysis (IA) will be conducted when approximately 50% of the patients have 
completed their treatment phase (i.e. week 12, Visit 5). This IA is intended to provide early 
delivery of key data to facilitate forward planning of the QAW039 program. The key data 
points to be analyzed in the IA may include, but is not limited to, some of the exploratory 
endpoints as well as the following: 
• sputum eosinophil percentage at week 12 
• ACQ at week 12 
• AQLQ at week 12  
• FEV1 at week 12 
Since the trial will not be stopped for overwhelming efficacy, no adjustment of the alpha level 
is planned for the final analysis. The details of the interim analysis results will be kept blinded 
to the trial personnel, participating investigators, and patients during the course of the study. 
The analysis will be performed by the independent statistician and independent programmer 
who will be fully unblinded to the patient-level information. Only the comparative results 
between treatment groups will be released and reviewed by an authorized group for future 
planning of the QAW039 program. The authorized group, external to the clinical trial team, 
will receive the results under a confidentiality agreement that the results must by no means be 
disclosed to anybody outside authorized group. 
The predictive power will be used as the basis for futility decision when there is little 
evidence of a beneficial treatment effect. The predictive power is the probability that the final

study result will be statistically significant given the data observed thus far weighted 
averaging over a range of future treatment effect. The weights are based on the posterior 
distribution of treatment effect given the observed data at interim with non-informative prior. 
If the predictive probability is below a pre-specified level for futility (0.05 for instance), 
stopping the trial before it is finished may be considered. The decision rule to be used at the 
interim analysis stage and the operating characteristics will be described and evaluated in a 
separate document.

Sample size calculation 
Table 9-1 provides the sample sizes required for each respective outcome measure (the 
primary and secondary variables) in order to achieve an 80% power to detect the minimally 
important difference at a two-tailed 5% significance level.  
This study is aimed to power for a 50% reduction in sputum eosinophil percentage. This is 
equivalent to an absolute reduction in log10 (sputum eosinophil percentage) of log102 = 0.301 
(Inman et al, 2002, Barnes et al, 2011). The minimally important differences for the primary 
and key secondary endpoints are listed in Table 9-1.

With 30 patients per arm to be randomized, it is expected that 24 patients per arm will 
complete week 12 assessment, assuming the dropout rate during the course of treatment phase 
(12 weeks) is 20%. With this sample size, the primary and secondary endpoints achieve ≥80% 
power to detect minimally important difference between QAW039 and placebo, as specified 
in Table 9-1.

regulations (including European Directive 2001/20/EC, US Code of Federal Regulations Title 
21, and Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare), and with the ethical principles laid 
down in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
10.2 
Informed consent procedures 
Eligible patients may only be included in the study after providing written (witnessed, where 
required by law or regulation), IRB/IEC-approved informed consent, or, if incapable of doing 
so, after such consent has been provided by a legally acceptable representative of the patient. 
In cases where the patient’s representative gives consent, the patient should be informed about 
the study to the extent possible given his/her understanding. If the patient is capable of doing 
so, he/she should indicate assent by personally signing and dating the written informed 
consent document or a separate assent form. Informed consent must be obtained before 
conducting any study-specific procedures (i.e. all of the procedures described in the protocol). 
The process of obtaining informed consent should be documented in the patient source 
documents.  
Novartis will provide to investigators in a separate document a proposed informed consent 
form that complies with the ICH GCP guideline and regulatory requirements and is 
considered appropriate for this study. Any changes to the proposed consent form suggested by 
the investigator must be agreed to by Novartis before submission to the IRB/IEC, and a copy 
of the approved version must be provided to the Novartis monitor or designee after IRB/IEC 
approval. 
Women of child bearing potential should be informed that taking the study treatment may 
involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and agree that 
in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement for the 
duration of the study. If there is any question that the patient will not reliably comply, they 
should not be entered in the study. 
The study includes some optional components which require a separate signature if the patient 
agrees to participate. It is required as part of this protocol that the investigator presents these 
options to the patient. The process for obtaining consent should be exactly the same as 
described above for the main informed consent. 
Declining to participate in these assessments will in no way affect the patient’s ability to 
participate in the main research study. 
In the event that Novartis wants to perform testing on the samples that are not described in 
this protocol, additional Institutional Review Board and/or ethics committee approval will be 
obtained. 
10.3 
Responsibilities of the investigator and IRB/IEC 
The protocol and the proposed informed consent form must be reviewed and approved by a 
properly constituted Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee/Research 
Ethics Board (IRB/IEC) before study start. A signed and dated statement that the protocol and 
informed consent have been approved by the IRB/IEC must be given to Novartis before study 
initiation. Prior to study start, the investigator is required to sign a protocol signature page 
confirming his/her agreement to conduct the study in accordance with these documents and all

of the instructions and procedures found in this protocol and to give access to all relevant data 
and records to Novartis monitors, auditors, Novartis Clinical Quality Assurance 
representatives, designated agents of Novartis, IRBs/IECs/REBs, and regulatory authorities as 
required. If an inspection of the clinical site is requested by a regulatory authority, the 
investigator must inform Novartis immediately that this request has been made. 
10.4 
Publication of study protocol and results 
Novartis assures that the key design elements of this protocol will be posted in a publicly 
accessible database such as clinicaltrials.gov. In addition, upon study completion and 
finalization of the study report the results of this trial will be either submitted for publication 
and/or posted in a publicly accessible database of clinical trial results. 
11 
Protocol adherence 
Investigators ascertain they will apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations. Under no 
circumstances should the investigator contact Novartis or its agents, if any, monitoring the 
trial to request approval of a protocol deviation, as no authorized deviations are permitted. If 
the investigator feels a protocol deviation would improve the conduct of the study this must 
be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment is agreed upon by 
Novartis and approved by the IRB/IEC it cannot be implemented. All significant protocol 
deviations will be recorded and reported in the CSR. 
11.1 
Protocol Amendments 
Any change or addition to the protocol can only be made in a written protocol amendment that 
must be approved by Novartis, Health Authorities where required, and the IRB/IEC. Only 
amendments that are required for patient safety may be implemented prior to IRB/IEC 
approval. Notwithstanding the need for approval of formal protocol amendments, the 
investigator is expected to take any immediate action required for the safety of any patient 
included in this study, even if this action represents a deviation from the protocol. In such 
cases, Novartis should be notified of this action and the IRB/IEC at the study site should be 
informed in accordance with local guidelines.

Appendices 
Appendix 1 Clinically notable laboratory values and vital signs  
Patients with an ALT or AST ≥ 5 x ULN, or with ALT or AST ≥ 2.5 x ULN and total 
bilirubin ≥ 1.5xULN, at any visit should be withdrawn from trial. An alert should be sent to 
the investigator and sponsor if patients experience these abnormal liver function test results. 
The central laboratory will flag laboratory values falling outside of the normal ranges on the 
central laboratory report (which the investigator should review and sign off) and the 
investigator will report any values considered clinically significant in the CRF. 
Notable values for vital signs and change from baseline will be summarized. A notable value 
is defined as follows: heart rate of <40 and >90 bpm; systolic blood pressure of <90 and >140 
mmHg; diastolic blood pressure of <50 and >90 mmHg. 
For ECGs a notable QTc value is defined as a QTc (Fridericia’s) interval of greater than 450 
msec for males and 470 msec for females – all such ECGs will be flagged by the cardiologist 
and require assessment for clinical relevance by the Investigator. 
Patients with a heart rate of >100 bpm measured on 2 occasions, approximately 10 minutes 
apart, whilst resting, should be withdrawn from the trial.

Appendix 3: Spirometry Guidance 
Spirometry 
Equipment 
Spirometers must meet the specifications and performance criteria recommended in the 
American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) Standardization of 
Spirometry1. Spirometers must have the capacity to print FVC tracings. All spirometry values 
should be reported at BTPS by the method established by the manufacturer. 
Calibration 
The spirometer should be calibrated every morning before any spirometric measurements for 
the study are performed. Calibration values will be recorded and stored as source data at the 
site. 
Preparing the test subject 
On study days when spirometry will be performed, patients should refrain from the following: 
• Coffee, tea, chocolate, cola and other caffeine-containing beverages and foods and ice 
cold beverages for 4 hours prior to spirometry 
• Alcohol for 4 hours prior to spirometry 
• Strenuous activity for 12 hours prior to spirometry 
• Smoking within at least 2 hour of testing 
• Medication within the following timelines: 
Medication 
Withdrawal time 
Short-acting bronchodilator 
6 hrs 
Long-acting bronchodilator 
12 hrs 
Xanthines (Theophyllines) 
12 hrs 
Short-acting anticholinergics 
8 hrs 
Long-acting anticholinergic 
24 hrs 
Leukotrine antagonist (LTRA) 
12 hrs 
Inactivated vaccine 
No administration within 48 h prior to a study 
visit 
 
Every effort should be made to assure consistent testing conditions throughout the study. A 
seated position with nose clips is recommended. When possible, spirometry should be 
conducted by the same technician using the same spirometer. To minimize the effects of 
diurnal variation on lung function, spirometry visits should start at approximately the same 
time of day at each visit.

Protocol No. CQAW039A2208 
 
As spirometry is an effort-dependent test, it requires careful instruction and cooperation of the 
subject. The technician should ensure a good seal around the mouthpiece, and confirm that the 
subject’s posture is correct. The subject should be instructed to perform a maximal inspiration, 
followed by maximum forced expiration until no more air can be exhaled or for at least 6 
seconds. Expiration must be rapid with exertion of maximal effort. The results of spirometry 
should meet the ATS/ERS criteria for acceptability and repeatability. Acceptability criteria 
should be applied before repeatability is determined. 
Number of trials 
A minimum of 3 acceptable forced vital capacity (FVC) maneuvers should be performed. If a 
subject is unable to perform a single acceptable maneuver after 8 attempts, testing may be 
discontinued. 
Acceptability 
An acceptable maneuver has the following characteristics: 
• No hesitation or false start; 
• A rapid start; 
• No cough, especially during the first second of the maneuver; 
• No glottic closure or obstruction by tongue or dentures 
• No early termination of exhalation (minimum exhalation time of 6 seconds is 
recommended, or no volume change for at least 1 second) or the subject cannot continue 
to exhale further 
Repeatability 
The 2 largest FVC and FEV1 values from 3 acceptable maneuvers should not vary by more 
than 0.150 L. 
Recording of data 
The highest FEV1 and FVC from any of the acceptable curves are recorded. (The highest 
FEV1 and FVC may not necessarily result from the same acceptable curve).  
Predicted normal 
For subjects greater than 18 years of age, this study will utilize the spirometric predication 
equation standards for the European Community for Coal and Steel 2  
Reversibility 
All reversibility evaluations should follow the recommendations of the ATS/ERS Task force: 
Standardization of Lung Function Testing. A baseline spirometry assessment should be 
performed after a medication washout period. (please see spirometry guidelines provided 
above) 
Administer 400µg of salbutamol/360µg of albuterol following the completion of the baseline 
assessment. A second spirometry assessment is then performed within 10 to 15 minutes after 
administration of the salbumatol/albuterol. 
Reversibility is calculated as:

 Summary of Changes 
Amendment 1 (29 Feb 2012) 
Amendment rationale 
This protocol has been amended mainly to provide more information about the pulmonary function 
tests being performed in the study so as to promote clarity on the types of tests included. The other 
main reason for the amendment was to add another stratification factor of patients undergoing 
bronchoscopy versus those not undergoing bronchoscopy to the randomization scheme in an effort to 
minimize major imbalances between patients receiving placebo and those receiving active study 
medication. 
At time of writing one patient had been enrolled into the study. The amendment is not expected to 
impact the study results and the changes do not impact on the safety of patients participating in the 
study. 
Changes to the protocol 
The types of pulmonary function tests being performed in the study to assess patients’ lung function 
have been clarified to make more explicit that these tests include body plethysmography, carbon 
monoxide transfer factor, impulse and forced oscillometry. Main protocol sections modified due to this 
change are sections 6.4.2 and 6.4.3. 
Another stratification factor has been added to minimize the chances of having unequal allocation of 
treatment for patients opting to undergo bronchoscopy verse those not wishing to. This change 
warranted a new randomization scheme and a revised randomization strata table (table 5-1) has been 
included. Main protocol sections modified due to this change are sections 5.1.3 and 5.2.1. 
Further, information regarding treatment blinding and dispensing was clarified and made succinct. The 
emboldened section reminding investigators to not reveal information to patients regarding the 
assignment to placebo for the run-in and washout phase of the study was moved from Section 5.2.2 and 
added to Section 5.1.5. Section 5.2.2 was made more succinct in order to increase the usefulness of the 
information provided. 
In Section 5.2.5, information regarding the use of restricted medication was refined to provide more 
clarity on withdrawal timelines. The assessment schedule table (table 6-1) was revised to make 
consistent with the information provided in the body of the protocol. 
Also incorporated, are other smaller changes based on recommendations, as well as some editorial 
changes that include correction of typographical errors and some clarifications and rewording to ensure 
consistency between protocol sections. 
Changes to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version of the protocol using 
strike through red font for deletions and red underlined for insertions. A copy of this amended protocol 
 will be sent to the Institutional Review Board (IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committee (IECs) and Health 
Authorities. 
The changes described in this amended protocol require IRB/IEC approval prior to implementation. In 
addition, if the changes herein affect the Informed Consent, sites are required to update and submit for 
approval a revised Informed Consent that takes into account the changes described in this amended 
protocol. 
Amendment 2 (26 Jun 2012) 
This protocol has been amended mainly to provide clarification about the interim analysis to 
be performed in the study. 
At time of writing nine patients had been enrolled into the study. The amendment is not expected to 
impact the study results and the changes do not impact on the safety of patients participating in the 
study. 
Changes to the protocol 
More information regarding type and timing of the interim analysis to be performed in the study has 
been provided making clear that a futility analysis will be performed when approximately 30 patients 
have completed their Visit 5. Main protocol sections modified due to this change are sections 3.1, 3.5 
and 9.6. 
The upper limit for the range of admissible Body Mass Index (BMI) has been increased from 40 kg/m2 to 
45 kg/m2. This change has been made in order to allow the inclusion of more patients with severe 
asthma as it is now apparent that many of the more severely asthmatic patients in our study population 
have higher BMIs. Main protocol sections modified due to this change are Section 4.2 and the Protocol 
Synopsis section. 
The time points for performing body plethysmography and carbon monoxide transfer have been 
indicated in the assessment schedule (Table 6-1). 
Further, clarification has been provided that the burden of tests assessment with regards to testing for 
volatile organic compounds applies to all patients and not only those undergoing MRI. This clarification 
is reflected in Section 6.4.10 and footnote 9c in the assessment schedule (Table 6-1). 
Also incorporated, are other smaller editorial changes that include correction of typographical errors 
and rewording to ensure consistency between protocol sections. 
Changes to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version of the protocol using 
strike through red font for deletions and red underlined for insertions. 
A copy of this amended protocol will be sent to the Institutional Review Board (IRBs)/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IECs) and Health Authorities. The changes described in this amended protocol require 
IRB/IEC approval prior to implementation. In addition, if the changes herein affect the Informed 
 Consent, sites are required to update and submit for approval a revised Informed Consent that takes 
into account the changes described in this amended protocol.

Introduction 
 
This 
document 
contains 
details 
of 
the 
statistical 
methods 
which 
will 
be 
used 
in 
the 
phase 
II 
clinical 
trial 
CQAW039A2208. 
The 
purpose 
of 
this 
study 
is 
to 
determine 
whether, 
in 
patients 
with 
sputum 
eosinophilia 
(≥ 
2%) 
and 
persistent, 
moderate-
to-
severe 
asthma, 
12-
weeks 
treatment 
with 
QAW039 
at 
a 
dose 
of 
225 
mg 
b.i.d. 
(compared 
to 
placebo), 
on 
top 
of 
conventional 
treatment, 
reduces 
the 
levels 
of 
eosinophils 
in 
induced 
sputum. 
As 
well 
as 
providing comparative (against placebo) safety data from this population of patients, 
measurements 
made 
in 
this 
study 
will 
also 
be 
used 
to 
establish 
whether 
this 
treatment 
improves 
other 
measures 
of 
asthma 
disease 
activity, 
lung 
function 
and 
lung 
pathology. 
 
Data 
will 
be 
analyzed 
according 
to 
the 
data 
analysis 
section 
9 
of 
the 
study 
protocol 
(unless 
otherwise 
stated 
below) 
which 
is 
available 
in 
Appendix 
16.1.1 
of 
the 
CSR. 
Important 
information 
is 
given 
in 
the 
following 
sections 
and 
details 
are 
provided, 
as 
applicable, 
in 
Appendix 
16.1.9 
of 
the 
CSR. 
 
 
1.1 
Study Design 
This 
study 
uses 
a 
2-
treatment 
arm 
(Placebo 
or 
QAW039), 
parallel 
group, 
double-
blind, 
randomized, 
placebo-
controlled 
design. 
After 
signing 
informed 
consent 
(Visit 
1), 
patients 
will 
undergo 
a 
2-
week 
placebo 
run-
in 
period 
during 
which 
their 
clinical 
stability 
and 
suitability 
for 
randomization 
will 
be 
assessed. 
Asthma 
patients 
who 
are 
already 
receiving 
ICS 
or 
ICS-
LABA 
therapy 
are 
the 
target 
population 
for 
this 
study. 
All 
patients 
will 
be 
allowed 
to 
continue 
on 
their 
current 
therapy. 
At 
the 
baseline 
visit 
(visit 
3) 
all 
eligible 
patients 
will 
be 
randomized 
to 
QAW039 
(225 
mg 
b.i.d.) 
or 
placebo 
for 
a 
treatment 
duration 
of 
12 
weeks. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
12-
week 
treatment 
period 
(visit 
5), 
all 
patients 
will 
receive 
placebo 
until 
the 
6-
week 
post-
treatment 
assessment 
(visit 
6). 
Both 
during 
the 
run-
in 
and 
wash-
out 
periods, 
the 
study 
will 
be 
single-
blind 
because 
physicians 
will 
know 
that 
patients 
are 
on 
placebo, 
however 
the 
12-
week 
treatment 
period 
will 
be 
double-
blind. 
Visits 
to 
assess 
safety 
and 
efficacy 
are 
scheduled 
at 
6, 
12, 
and 
18 
weeks 
post-
randomization. 
The 
assessment 
to 
address 
the 
primary 
objectives 
will 
be 
performed 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
treatment 
period 
(week 
12).

Baseline definitions 
 
In 
general, 
baseline 
is 
defined 
as 
the 
last 
measurement 
prior 
to 
the 
first 
dose 
of 
study 
treatment 
unless 
otherwise 
stated. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. 
Baseline 
Sputum 
eosinophil 
measure. 
Patients’ 
sputum 
will 
be 
tested 
for 
% 
sputum 
 
 
 
eosinophil 
count 
at 
Visit 
3.This 
will 
be 
the 
baseline 
value 
of 
the 
sputum 
eosinophil 
count. 
For 
patients, 
who 
do 
not 
have 
a 
sputum 
eosinophil 
count 
≥ 
2% 
at 
visit 
3, 
their 
% 
sputum 
eosinophil 
at 
Visit 
1 
will 
be 
considered 
to 
be 
the 
baseline. 
 
2.Baseline 
ACQ 
score. 
ACQ 
score 
is 
calculated 
as 
the 
mean 
of 
the 
7 
questions, 
calculated 
as 
the 
sum 
of 
scores 
divided 
by 
the 
number 
of 
questions 
that 
were 
answered 
by 
the 
patient. 
For 
ACQ 
questionnaires 
the 
baseline 
is 
defined 
as 
the 
values 
recorded 
by 
the 
patient 
at 
visit 
3. 
If 
any 
one 
of 
the 
seven 
item 
is 
missing 
at 
Visit 
3, 
it 
will 
be 
imputed 
from 
Visit 
2. 
For 
imputation 
logic 
see 
Section 
2.8.2. 
If 
after 
imputation 
from 
Visit 
2, 
question 
1 
and 
7 
is 
non-
missing 
and 
not 
more 
than 
one 
question 
from 
2 
to 
6 
is 
missing, 
then 
baseline 
ACQ 
score 
will 
be 
the 
average 
value 
of 
the 
six 
non-
missing 
values. 
If 
after 
imputation 
from 
Visit 
2, 
question 
1 
or 
7 
or 
more 
than 
two 
questions 
from 
2 
to 
6 
is 
missing, 
then 
that 
ACQ 
value 
will 
be 
set 
as 
missing. 
If 
ACQ 
values 
for 
Visit 
3 
is 
missing 
then 
for 
those 
patients 
with 
missing 
values, 
the 
mean 
of 
the 
baseline 
values 
of 
the 
non-
missing 
patients 
will 
be 
imputed 
as 
baseline 
values. 
 
 
3. 
Baseline 
AQLQ 
score. 
AQLQ 
score 
is 
calculated 
by 
taking 
the 
average 
of 
the 
total 
scores 
obtained 
from 
a 
questionnaire 
of 
32 
items. 
The 
32 
items 
are 
divided 
into 
4 
domains-
 
activity, 
symptom, 
emotional 
and 
environmental 
and 
considering 
them 
all 
together 
we 
get 
the 
total 
score. 
Baseline 
AQLQ 
score 
(domain 
wise 
and 
total) 
is 
defined 
as 
the 
value 
obtained 
at 
visit 
3. 
If 
any 
of 
the 
32 
items 
is 
missing 
it 
will 
be 
imputed 
from 
Visit 
2. 
For 
imputation 
logic 
see 
2.10.1. 
If 
even 
after 
imputation 
we 
have 
more 
than 
10% 
items 
missing, 
that 
is 
more 
than 
3 
items 
missing, 
then 
the 
total 
score 
will 
be 
set 
as 
missing. 
Further, 
for 
the 
activity 
and 
symptom 
domains, 
the 
 Novartis 
Confidential 
Page 10 
RAP Module 3 
September 25, 2013 
CQAW039A2208 
 
recommendation 
is 
no 
more 
than 
1 
missing 
value 
per 
domain, 
and 
for 
the 
emotional 
function 
and 
environmental 
stimuli 
domains, 
no 
missing 
responses 
at 
all. 
These 
conditions 
will 
be 
checked 
after 
imputation 
from 
Visit 
2. 
If 
these 
conditions 
are 
not 
met, 
then 
the 
baseline 
vale 
at 
Visit 
3 
is 
put 
as 
missing. 
If 
AQLQ 
values 
for 
Visit 
3 
is 
missing 
then 
for 
those 
patients 
with 
missing 
values, 
the 
mean 
of 
the 
baseline 
values 
of 
the 
non-
missing 
patients 
will 
be 
imputed 
as 
baseline 
values. 
This 
will 
be 
followed 
for 
the 
total 
score 
as 
well 
as 
the 
domain 
score. 
 
 
 
 
4. 
Baseline 
Spirometry 
end-
points. 
Baseline 
FEV1 
is 
defined 
as 
the 
FEV1 
measurement 
taken 
prior 
to 
the 
first 
dose 
of 
study 
drug 
(Visit 
3). 
If 
this 
assessment 
is 
missing 
(or 
is 
not 
confirmed 
to 
be 
pre-
dose), 
then 
the 
Visit 
2 
assessment 
will 
be 
considered 
as 
baseline. 
If 
the 
FEV1 
measurements 
are 
missing 
both 
on 
Day 
1 
and 
at 
the 
screening 
visit, 
the 
respective 
baseline 
values 
will 
be 
set 
to 
missing 
and 
the 
mean 
of 
the 
baseline 
values 
of 
the 
non-
missing 
patients 
will 
be 
imputed 
as 
baseline 
values. 
 
The 
baseline 
FVC 
is 
defined 
similar 
to 
FEV1 
baseline. 
 
 
5. 
Baseline 
FENO. 
For 
FeNO, 
baseline 
will 
be 
defined 
as 
the 
values 
recorded 
by 
the

If 
one 
of 
the 
two

is 
missing 
(or 
not 
confirmed 
to 
be 
pre-
dose) 
then 
the 
non-

will 
be 
taken 
as 
the 
baseline. 
If 
all 
values 
are 
missing 
(or 
not 
confirmed 
to 
be 
pre-
dose) 
then 
the 
last 
assessment 
taken 
prior

will 
be 
used. 
Otherwise, 
the 
ECG 
baseline 
will 
be

For 
baseline 
ECG 
interpretation 
there 
will 
only 
be 
one 
assessment 
at 
each

Post baseline definitions 
    
Post 
baseline 
measurements 
are 
defined 
as 
those 
assessments 
on 
or 
after 
the 
start 
of 
study 
treatment. 
 
 
For 
safety 
data, 
post 
baseline 
measurements 
include 
measurements 
recorded 
up 
to+7 
days 
for 
AEs 
and 
 
+30 
days 
 
for 
SAEs 
after

When 
change 
from 
baseline 
and 
percent 
change 
from

are 
of 
interest 
the 
following 
formula 
will 
be 
used 
where 
baseline 
and 
post-
baseline 
values 
are 
both 
available: 
Change 
from 
baseline 
= 
post-
baseline 
value 
– 
baseline 
value 
Percent 
change 
from 
baseline 
= 
Change 
from 
baseline/baseline 
value 
x 
100%. 
Safety 
measurements 
may 
include 
ECG, 
vital 
signs, 
laboratory 
analysis 
and 
adverse 
events. 
 
When 
deriving 
the 
ECG 
and 
vital

is 
the 
change 
from 
baseline 
in 
sputum 
eosinophil 
percentage 
at 
week

As 
sputum 
eosinophil 
percentage 
has 
been 
found 
to 
follow 
a 
log-
normal 
distribution, 
the 
analysis 
will 
be 
based 
on

Subgroup Analyses of Primary Variable 
 
We 
will 
perform

on 
the 
primary 
variable 
as 
given 
in 
2.8.1.1.1.,

2.8.2 
Secondary variable 
 
The 
secondary 
variables 
include 
the 
change 
from 
baseline 
to 
week 
12 
in 
ACQ. 
The 
baseline 
is 
defined 
as 
the 
assessment 
measured 
at 
Visit 
3 
(Day 
1) 
prior 
to 
the 
first 
dosing. 
 
 
 
The 
ACQ 
measures 
asthma 
symptom 
control 
and 
consists 
of 
7 
items: 
5 
on 
symptom 
assessment, 
1 
on 
rescue 
bronchodilator 
use 
and 
1 
on 
airway 
calibre 
(FEV1 
% 
predicted). 
All 
7 
questions 
of 
the 
ACQ 
are 
equally 
weighted. 
Items 
1-
6 
are 
scored 
along 
a 
7-
point 
response 
scale, 
where 
0 
= 
good 
controlled 
and 
6 
= 
poor 
controlled. 
Question 
7 
deals 
with 
FEV1 
% 
predicted 
pre-
bronchodilator. 
In 
case 
the 
values 
of 
FEV1 
% 
predicted 
pre-
bronchodilator 
are 
also 
available 
from 
the 
central 
spirometry 
reading 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
ACQ 
Q7 
from 
CRF, 
the 
central 
reading 
will 
be 
used 
to 
derive 
the 
ACQ 
score. 
The 
value 
of 
ACQ 
Q7 
will 
be 
used 
only 
if 
the 
central 
reading 
is 
not 
available. 
This 
single 
missing 
value 
may 
be 
interpolated 
by 
utilizing 
prior 
completions 
of 
the 
questionnaire 
as 
described 
in 
Section 
2.5.3.The 
7th 
item 
on 
% 
predicted 
FEV1 
(pre-
bronchodilator) 
is 
scored 
by 
clinic 
staff 
on 
a 
7-
point 
scale 
(0 
– 
> 
95-
 
99%;

The 
average 
score 
of 
the 
7 
questions 
at 
each 
visit 
will 
be 
calculated 
as 
the 
sum 
of 
scores 
divided 
by 
the 
number 
of 
questions 
that 
were 
answered 
by 
the 
patient 
at 
the 
visit,

there

nor

Data Handling 
If 
a 
measure 
of 
FEV1 
% 
predicted 
pre-
bronchodilator 
is 
missing 
in 
the 
central 
spirometry 
data, 
then 
we 
get 
it 
from 
the 
ACQ 
Q7 
in 
CRF. 
The 
ACQ 
score 
will 
then 
be 
calculated 
as 
the 
sum 
of 
scores 
divided 
by 
the 
number 
of 
questions 
that 
were 
answered 
by 
the 
patient 
at 
the 
visit, 
as 
long 
as 
there 
were 
at 
least 
6 
questions 
answered 
and 
preferable 
not 
question 
1(night 
time 
awakenings) 
or 
7 
(FEV1 
% 
predicted). 
 
For 
a 
missing 
individual 
item, 
the 
recommended 
method 
for 
handling 
missing 
data 
to 
reduce 
the 
risk 
of 
bias 
is 
to 
interpolate 
using 
either 
previous 
or 
subsequent 
completions 
of 
the 
questionnaire.

It 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
a 
post-
treatment 
missing 
data 
 
can 
only 
be 
imputed 
using 
a 
post 
treatment 
visit, 
and 
a 
missing 
value 
at 
baseline 
(visit 
3) 
can 
only 
be 
interpolated 
using 
a 
value 
from 
Visit

That 
is, 
if 
the 
missing 
is 
at 
baseline 
(visit

then 
we 
can 
only 
do 
backward

on

we

2.8.3.1.1 Analysis of Covariance  
 
The 
spirometry 
variables 
will 
be 
summarized 
by 
treatments 
(QAW039 
and 
placebo), 
analyzed 
and 
presented 
using 
an 
ANCOVA 
model 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
described 
for 
primary 
variable. 
 
Subgroup Analyses: 
 
We 
will 
perform 
ANCOVA 
on 
the 
spirometry 
parameters 
FEV1 
and 
FVC 
as 
mentioned 
in 
2.8.3.1.1 
for 
the 
above 
mentioned 
subgroups. 
 
2.8.3.1.2 Analysis of Covariance with % predicted FEV1 at baseline as covariate 
 
Similar 
to 
2.8.2.1.1, 
to 
examine 
how 
the 
%predicted 
FEV1 
at 
baseline 
in 
a 
continuous 
scale 
impacts 
the 
change 
from 
baseline 
of 
FEV1 
and 
FVC 
during 
post-
baseline 
the 
endpoints 
of 
interest, 
the 
change 
from 
baseline 
in 
FEV1 
and 
FVC 
 
will 
also 
be 
analyzed 
using 
an 
ANCOVA 
model 
by 
including 
%predicted 
FEV1 
at 
baseline 
as 
a 
covariate. 
 
In 
case 
of 
FEV1 
we 
will 
replace 
baseline 
FEV1 
covariate 
with 
baseline 
% 
predicted 
FEV1 
as 
covariate 
in 
the 
ANCOVA 
model. 
In 
case 
of 
FVC, 
we 
will 
include 
baseline 
% 
predicted 
FEV1 
as 
an 
additional 
covariate 
in 
the 
ANCOVA 
model. 
 
 
Multicollinearity 
has 
to 
be 
checked 
as 
there 
is 
a 
possibility 
of 
correlation 
between 
baseline 
value 
of 
FVC 
and 
the 
baseline 
value 
of 
% 
predicted 
FEV1. 
If 
the 
Variance 
Inflation 
Factor(VIF) 
of 
the 
model 
with 
both 
the 
baseline 
values 
present 
is 
more 
than 
10, 
then 
we 
will 
drop 
the 
baseline 
value 
of 
the 
secondary 
end-
point 
in 
the 
covariate 
and 
only 
include 
the 
baseline 
value 
of 
% 
predicted 
FEV1 
and 
perform 
our 
ANCOVA 
analyses.

answered

(1 
=

7 
=

The

Overall

Mean

Items

(32

Each 
item 
of 
the 
AQLQ 
is 
equally 
weighted 
and 
scored 
along 
a 
7-
point 
scale, 
where 
1 
indicates 
maximal 
impairment 
and 
7 
indicates 
no 
impairment. 
Thus, 
higher 
scores 
indicate 
better 
asthma-
related 
HRQOL. 
There 
is 
a 
mean 
score 
calculated 
for 
each 
of 
the 
four 
domains, 
as 
well 
as 
an 
overall 
quality-
of-
life 
score, 
which 
is 
the 
mean 
score 
of 
all 
32 
items. 
The 
resultant 
overall 
scores 
will 
be 
between 
1 
and 
7. 
The developer suggests no more than 10% of missing data. This means that for a 
questionnaire 
of 
32 
items, 
no 
more 
than 
3 
items 
should 
be 
missing. 
 
Further, 
for 
the 
activity 
and 
symptom 
domains, 
the 
recommendation 
is 
no 
more 
than 
1 
missing 
value 
per 
domain, 
and 
for 
the 
emotional 
function 
and 
environmental 
stimuli 
domains, 
no 
missing 
responses 
at 
all. 
 
 
The 
recommended 
method 
for 
handling 
missing 
data 
to 
reduce 
the 
risk 
of 
bias 
is 
to 
interpolate 
(pro-
rate) 
missing 
values 
using 
either 
previous 
or 
subsequent 
completed 
questionnaires 
per 
domain, 
in

2.12.1.1 The risk of liver toxicity (SPP risk, Routine risk) 
(1) Cases defined by lab parameters 
The 
liver 
function 
tests 
(LFT) 
under 
consideration 
include 
the 
following 
serum 
blood 
chemistry 
lab 
parameters: 
ALT,

with 
respect 
to 
normal 
reference

and 
box

will 
be 
produced 
over 
time. 
 
In 
addition, 
to 
evaluate 
potential 
indicators 
of 
drug-
induced 
liver 
injury 
or 
dysfunction, 
patients 
with 
newly 
occurring 
elevations 
in 
LFT 
at 
any 
time 
post-
baseline 
are 
summarized 
and 
listed 
based 
on 
the 
following

This 
is 
to

if 
there 
is 
any 
evidence 
of 
increases 
in 
AST 
or 
ALT, 
beyond 
expected

time 
and 
to 
investigate 
whether 
they 
are 
accompanied 
by 
a 
similar

in 
Total 
Bilirubin. 
For 
a 
criterion 
with 
combined 
components, 
such 
as 
lab 
criteria 
for 
Hy’s 
Law 
which 
has 
at 
least 
3 
components, 
each 
condition 
has 
to 
happen 
exactly 
at 
the 
same 
time 
to 
meet 
the 
criteria. 
A 
case 
is 
considered 
as 
newly 
occurring 
if 
the 
baseline 
condition 
does 
not 
meet 
the 
clinically 
notable 
criterion 
but 
clinically 
notable 
at 
post-
baseline. 
For 
patients 
with 
missing 
value 
in 
baseline 
for 
at 
least 
one 
component, 
post-

values 
meeting

of 
patients 
with 
newly

the 
treatment 
period, 
considering 
all 
post-

value 
meeting 
the 
clinically 
notable 
criteria 
will 
be 
counted

criteria. 
 
For 
a 
patient 
to 
meet 
the 
criterion 
of 
a 
newly

clinically 
notable 
value, 
the 
patient 
needs 
to 
have 
a 
baseline 
value 
which 
is 
not 
clinically 
notable 
for 
that 
parameter. 
 
For 
a 
patient 
to 
meet 
the 
criterion 
of 
a 
worsening 
clinically 
notable 
value, 
the 
patient 
needs 
to 
have 
a 
baseline 
value 
which 
is 
clinically 
notable 
and 
also 
have 
a 
worse 
post-
baseline 
value. 
For 
patients 
with 
missing 
value 
in 
baseline, 
any 
post-
baseline 
notable 
value 
will 
be 
considered 
as 
newly

Guidelines 
for 
clinically 
notable 
criteria 
for 
laboratory 
tests 
are 
based 
on 
the 
FDA

2.12.2.4.3 
     Overall ECG interpretation 
The 
Overall 
ECG 
interpretation 
is 
the 
qualitative 
ECG 
assessment. 
ECGs 
will 
be 
centrally 
reviewed 
by 
a 
cardiologist. 
If 
the 
central 
cardiologist 
reported 
that 
an 
ECG 
was 
abnormal, 
then 
the 
investigator 
commented 
in 
the 
CRF 
as 
to 
whether 
the 
ECG 
abnormality 
was 
“normal”, 
“clinically 
insignificant 
abnormality” 
or 
“clinically 
significant 
abnormality”. 
The 
overall 
interpretation 
is 
based 
on 
the 
evaluation 
provided 
by 
the 
investigators 
and 
the 
central 
readings, 
respectively. 
 
 
Shift 
tables 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
compare 
a 
patient’s 
overall 
ECG 
interpretation 
at 
screening 
to 
the

2.12.2.4.4 
     ECG abnormalities 
Using 
the 
morphologic 
determinations, 
the 
number 
and 
percentage 
of 
patients 
with 
qualitative 
ECG 
abnormality 
will 
be 
summarized 
overall during the study period as well as for each 
visit/ timepoint. 
 
 
The 
abnormality 
will 
be 
summarized 
by 
baseline 
condition 
(NO/YES, 
i.e. 
newly 
occurring 
cases, 
or 
persistent/recurrent 
cases) 
for 
each 
evaluation 
type 
and 
finding. 
The 
qualitative 
ECG 
abnormality will be determined by abnormality of Rhythm, Arrhythmia, Conduction, 
Morphology, 
Myocardial 
infarction, 
ST 
segment, 
T 
wave 
abnormalities, 
and 
abnormal 
U 
wave 
for 
example. 
A

For 
a 
patient 
to 
meet 
the 
criterion 
of 
a 
newly

value, 
the 
patient 
needs 
to 
have 
a

value 
which 
is 
not

for 
that 
parameter. 
For 
a 
patient 
to 
meet 
the 
criterion 
of 
a 
worsening 
clinically 
notable 
value, 
the 
patient 
needs 
to 
have 
a 
baseline 
value 
which 
is 
clinically

statistical 
methods 
which 
will 
be 
used 
in 
the 
phase 
II 
clinical 
trial 
CQAW039A2208. 
The 
purpose 
of 
this 
study 
is 
to 
determine 
whether, 
in 
patients 
with 
sputum 
eosinophilia 
(≥ 
2%) 
and 
persistent, 
moderate-
to-
severe 
asthma, 
12-
weeks 
treatment 
with 
QAW039 
at 
a 
dose 
of 
225 
mg 
b.i.d. 
(compared 
to 
placebo), 
on 
top 
of 
conventional 
treatment, 
reduces 
the 
levels 
of 
eosinophils 
in 
induced 
sputum. 
As 
well 
as 
providing comparative (against placebo) safety data from this population of patients, 
measurements 
made 
in 
this 
study 
will 
also 
be 
used 
to 
establish 
whether 
this 
treatment 
improves 
other 
measures 
of 
asthma 
disease 
activity, 
lung 
function 
and 
lung 
pathology. 
 
Data 
will 
be 
analyzed 
according 
to

1.1 
Study Design 
This 
study 
uses 
a 
2-
treatment 
arm 
(Placebo 
or 
QAW039), 
parallel 
group, 
double-
blind, 
randomized, 
placebo-
controlled 
design. 
After 
signing 
informed 
consent 
(Visit 
1), 
patients 
will 
undergo 
a 
2-
week 
placebo 
run-
in 
period 
during 
which 
their 
clinical 
stability 
and 
suitability 
for 
randomization 
will 
be 
assessed. 
Asthma 
patients 
who 
are 
already 
receiving 
ICS 
or 
ICS-
LABA 
therapy 
are 
the 
target 
population 
for 
this 
study. 
All 
patients 
will 
be 
allowed 
to 
continue 
on 
their 
current 
therapy. 
At 
the 
baseline 
visit 
(visit 
3) 
all 
eligible 
patients 
will 
be 
randomized 
to 
QAW039 
(225 
mg 
b.i.d.) 
or 
placebo 
for 
a 
treatment 
duration 
of 
12 
weeks. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
12-
week 
treatment 
period 
(visit 
5), 
all 
patients 
will 
receive 
placebo 
until 
the 
6-
week 
post-
treatment 
assessment 
(visit 
6). 
Both 
during 
the 
run-
in 
and 
wash-
out 
periods, 
the 
study 
will 
be 
single-
blind 
because 
physicians 
will 
know 
that 
patients 
are 
on 
placebo, 
however 
the 
12-
week 
treatment 
period 
will 
be 
double-
blind. 
Visits 
to 
assess 
safety 
and 
efficacy 
are 
scheduled 
at 
6, 
12, 
and 
18 
weeks 
post-
randomization. 
The 
assessment 
to 
address 
the 
primary 
objectives 
will 
be 
performed 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
treatment 
period 
(week 
12).

• The Randomized Set (RAN), 
which 
comprises 
all 
randomized 
patients, 
regardless 
of 
whether 
or 
not 
they 
actually

study 
medication, 
will

Patients 
in 
RAN 
will 
be 
analyzed 
according 
to 
the 
treatment 
they 
were 
randomized 
to. 
This 
analysis 
set 
is 
not 
necessary 
 
unless 
the 
Full 
analysis 
set 
is 
different 
from 
the 
randomized 
set. 
• The Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
will 
include 
all 
randomized 
patients 
who 
received 
at 
least 
one 
dose 
of 
study 
drug. 
FAS 
will 
be 
used 
to 
analyze 
all 
efficacy 
endpoints, 
unless 
otherwise 
stated. 
Following 
the 
intention-
to-
treat 
principle, 
patients 
in 
the 
FAS 
will 
be 
analyzed 
according 
to 
the 
treatment 
they 
were 
randomized 
to. 
The 
potential 
biases 
arising 
from 
excluding 
the 
randomized 
patients 
who 
took 
no 
study 
medication 
are 
negligible 
since 
the 
decision 
of 
whether 
or 
not 
to 
begin 
treatment 
could 
not 
be 
influenced 
by 
knowledge 
of 
whether 
being 
assigned 
study 
drug 
or 
placebo. 
 
Although 
some 
Phase 
III 
trials 
may 
include 
an 
active 
control 
arm, 
the 
primary 
comparisons 
in 
all 
trials 
will 
be 
between 
investigational 
study 
drug 
and 
placebo. 
• The per-protocol (PP) set 
will 
include 
all 
patients 
in 
the 
FAS 
without 
any 
major 
protocol 
deviations 
that 
could 
confound 
the 
interpretation 
of 
analyses 
conducted 
on 
the 
FAS. 
 
Major 
protocol 
deviations 
will 
be 
defined 
prior 
to 
database 
lock 
and 
without 
knowing 
the 
treatment 
of 
individual 
cases. 
Patients 
will 
be 
analyzed 
according 
to 
the 
treatment 
group 
as 
randomized. 
 
PP 
will 
be 
used 
for 
supportive 
analysis 
to 
assess 
robustness 
of 
the 
primary, 
secondary 
analyses 
and 
some 
spirometry 
endpoints 
as 
exploratory 
analyses. 
Patients 
with 
compliance 
less 
than 
80% 
and 
more 
than 
120% 
during 
double-
blind 
treatment 
period 
will 
be 
excluded 
from 
the 
PP 
set. 
• The Safety set (SAF) 
will 
include 
all 
patients 
who 
received 
at 
least 
one 
dose 
of 
study 
drug 
whether 
or 
not 
being 
randomized. 
Patients 
will 
be 
analyzed 
according 
to 
the 
treatment 
they 
received. 
If 
patients 
switch 
treatment 
during 
the 
study, 
they 
will 
be 
analyzed, 
for example, according to the treatment they were randomized to or as the 
highest dose of Novartis compound. 
The 
safety 
set 
will 
be 
used 
in 
the 
analysis 
of 
all 
safety 
endpoints 
and 
in 
the 
listings 
of 
certain 
notable 
safety 
data. 
• The pharmacokinetic set (PK) 
will 
include 
all 
randomized 
patients 
who 
receive 
at 
least 
one 
dose 
of 
study 
medication 
and 
have 
evaluable 
plasma 
concentration 
data. 
The 
PK 
set 
will 
be 
used 
in 
PK 
analysis. 
Patients 
will 
be 
analyzed 
according 
to 
the 
treatment 
they 
received. 
 
Note 
that 
the 
FAS 
and 
safety 
set 
are 
the 
same 
except 
that 
the 
safety 
set 
allows 
the 
inclusion 
of 
non-
randomized patients who receive study drug in error. Also 
the FAS set assigns 
randomized 
treatment 
and 
the 
safety

assigns 
received 
treatment. 
 
The 
analyses 
of 
the 
primary 
objective 
and 
other 
efficacy 
variables

2.Baseline 
ACQ 
score. 
ACQ 
score 
is 
calculated 
as 
the 
mean 
of 
the 
7 
questions, 
calculated 
as 
the 
sum 
of 
scores 
divided 
by 
the 
number 
of 
questions 
that 
were 
answered 
by 
the 
patient. 
For 
ACQ 
questionnaires 
the 
baseline 
is 
defined 
as 
the 
values 
recorded 
by 
the 
patient 
at 
visit 
3. 
If 
any 
one 
of 
the 
seven 
item 
is 
missing 
at 
Visit 
3, 
it 
will 
be 
imputed 
from 
Visit 
2. 
For 
imputation 
logic 
see 
Section 
2.8.2. 
If 
after 
imputation 
from 
Visit 
2, 
question 
1 
and 
7 
is 
non-
missing 
and 
not 
more 
than 
one 
question 
from 
2 
to 
6 
is 
missing, 
then 
baseline 
ACQ 
score 
will 
be 
the 
average 
value 
of 
the 
six 
non-
missing 
values. 
If 
after 
imputation 
from 
Visit 
2, 
question 
1 
or 
7 
or 
more 
than 
two 
questions 
from 
2 
to 
6 
is 
missing, 
then 
that 
ACQ 
value 
will 
be 
set 
as 
missing. 
If 
ACQ 
values 
for 
Visit 
3 
is 
missing 
then 
for 
those 
patients 
with 
missing 
values, 
the 
mean 
of 
the 
baseline 
values 
of 
the 
non-
missing 
patients 
will 
be 
imputed 
as 
baseline 
values. 
 
 
3. 
Baseline 
AQLQ 
score. 
AQLQ 
score 
is 
calculated 
by 
taking 
the 
average 
of 
the 
total 
scores 
obtained 
from 
a 
questionnaire 
of 
32 
items. 
The 
32 
items 
are 
divided 
into 
4 
domains-
 
activity, 
symptom, 
emotional 
and 
environmental 
and 
considering 
them 
all 
together 
we 
get 
the 
total 
score. 
Baseline 
AQLQ 
score 
(domain 
wise 
and 
total) 
is 
defined 
as 
the 
value 
obtained 
at 
visit 
3. 
If 
any 
of 
the 
32 
items 
is 
missing 
it 
will 
be 
imputed 
from 
Visit 
2. 
For 
imputation 
logic 
see 
2.10.1. 
If 
even 
after 
imputation 
we 
have 
more 
than 
10% 
items 
missing, 
that 
is 
more 
than 
3 
items 
missing, 
then 
the 
total 
score 
will 
be 
set 
as 
missing. 
Further, 
for 
the 
activity 
and 
symptom 
domains, 
the 
recommendation 
is 
no 
more 
than 
1 
missing 
value 
per 
domain, 
and 
for 
the 
emotional 
function 
and 
environmental 
stimuli 
domains, 
no 
missing 
responses 
at 
all. 
These 
conditions 
will 
be 
checked 
after 
imputation 
from 
Visit 
2. 
If 
these 
conditions 
are 
not 
met, 
then 
the 
baseline 
vale 
at 
Visit 
3 
is 
put 
as 
missing. 
If 
AQLQ 
values 
for 
Visit 
3 
is 
missing 
then 
for 
those 
patients 
with 
missing 
values, 
the 
mean 
of 
the 
baseline 
values 
of 
the 
non-
missing 
patients 
will 
be 
imputed 
as 
baseline 
values. 
This 
will 
be 
followed 
for 
the 
total 
score 
as 
well 
as 
the 
domain 
score. 
 
 
 
 
4. 
Baseline 
Spirometry 
end-
points. 
Baseline 
FEV1

defined 
as 
the 
FEV1 
measurement 
taken 
prior 
to 
the 
first 
dose 
of 
study 
drug 
(Visit 
3). 
If 
this 
assessment 
is 
missing 
(or 
is 
not 
confirmed 
to 
be 
pre-
dose), 
then 
the 
Visit 
2 
assessment 
will 
be 
considered 
as 
baseline. 
If 
the 
FEV1 
measurements 
are 
missing 
both 
on 
Day 
1 
and 
at 
the 
screening 
visit, 
the 
respective 
baseline 
values 
will 
be 
set 
to 
missing 
and 
the 
mean 
of 
the 
baseline 
values 
of 
the 
non-
missing 
patients 
will 
be 
imputed 
as 
baseline 
values. 
 
The 
baseline 
FVC 
is 
defined 
similar 
to 
FEV1 
baseline.

Checks 
will 
be 
performed 
to 
ensure 
the 
ECG 
was 
indeed 
assessed 
prior 
to 
the 
first 
dose 
of 
study 
drug. 
If 
one 
of 
the 
two 
values 
is 
missing 
(or 
not 
confirmed 
to 
be 
pre-

will 
be 
taken 
as 
the 
baseline. 
If 
all 
values 
are 
missing 
(or 
not 
confirmed 
to 
be 
pre-
dose) 
then 
the 
last 
assessment 
taken

Otherwise, 
the 
ECG 
baseline

ECG 
interpretation 
there 
will 
only

2.3.5 
Post baseline definitions 
    
Post 
baseline 
measurements 
are 
defined 
as 
those 
assessments 
on 
or 
after 
the 
start 
of 
study 
treatment. 
 
 
For 
safety 
data, 
post 
baseline 
measurements 
include 
measurements 
recorded 
up 
to+7 
days 
for 
AEs 
and 
 
+30 
days 
 
for 
SAEs 
after 
the 
last 
dose 
of 
study 
drug 
or 
last 
visit 
whichever 
is 
later. 
 
 
When 
change 
from 
baseline 
and 
percent 
change 
from 
baseline 
are 
of 
interest 
the 
following 
formula 
will 
be 
used 
where 
baseline 
and 
post-
baseline 
values 
are 
both 
available: 
Change 
from 
baseline 
= 
post-
baseline 
value 
– 
baseline 
value 
Percent 
change 
from 
baseline 
= 
Change 
from 
baseline/baseline 
value 
x 
100%. 
Safety 
measurements 
may 
include 
ECG, 
vital 
signs, 
laboratory 
analysis 
and 
adverse 
events. 
 
When 
deriving 
the 
ECG 
and 
vital 
signs, 
values 
which 
have 
complete 
date 
and 
time 
values 
are 
assigned 
to 
pre 
or 
post-
dose 
assessment 
based 
on 
the 
actual 
date/time. 
However, 
values 
with 
missing 
date/time 
are 
assigned 
to 
their 
respective 
scheduled 
visit 
date 
and 
time. 
 
2.3.6 
Missing data handling 
  
Missing

Subgroup Analyses of Primary Variable 
 
We

on 
the

as 
given 
in 
2.8.1.1.1.,

2.8.2 
Secondary variable 
 
The 
secondary 
variables 
include 
the 
change 
from 
baseline 
to 
week 
12 
in 
ACQ. 
The 
baseline 
is 
defined 
as 
the 
assessment 
measured 
at 
Visit 
3 
(Day 
1) 
prior 
to 
the 
first 
dosing. 
 
 
 
The 
ACQ 
measures 
asthma 
symptom 
control 
and 
consists 
of 
7 
items: 
5 
on 
symptom 
assessment, 
1 
on 
rescue 
bronchodilator 
use 
and 
1 
on 
airway 
calibre 
(FEV1 
% 
predicted). 
All 
7 
questions 
of 
the 
ACQ 
are 
equally 
weighted. 
Items 
1-
6 
are 
scored 
along 
a 
7-
point 
response 
scale, 
where 
0 
= 
good 
controlled 
and 
6 
= 
poor 
controlled. 
Question 
7 
deals 
with 
FEV1 
% 
predicted 
pre-
bronchodilator. 
In 
case 
the 
values 
of 
FEV1 
% 
predicted 
pre-
bronchodilator 
are 
also 
available 
from 
the 
central 
spirometry 
reading 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
ACQ 
Q7 
from 
CRF, 
the 
central 
reading 
will 
be 
used 
to 
derive 
the 
ACQ 
score. 
The 
value 
of 
ACQ 
Q7 
will 
be 
used 
only 
if 
the 
central 
reading 
is 
not 
available. 
This 
single 
missing 
value 
may 
be 
interpolated 
by 
utilizing 
prior 
completions 
of 
the 
questionnaire 
as 
described 
in 
Section 
2.5.3.The 
7th 
item 
on 
% 
predicted 
FEV1 
(pre-

is 
scored 
by 
clinic 
staff 
on 
a

The 
average

of 
the

at 
each

will 
be

Data Handling 
If 
a 
measure 
of 
FEV1 
% 
predicted 
pre-

then 
we 
get

Appendix 16.1.9 
Documentation of statistical methods 
Introduction 
This appendix gives details about statistical methods in addition to 
that provided in 
Section 
9.7 
of 
the 
main 
report 
text. 
 
All 
analyses 
were 
performed 
by 
using 
SAS 
Version 
9.3. 
 
Inferential 
analyses 
were 
pre-
planned 
and 
were 
conducted 
at 
a 
two-
sided 
significance 
level 
of 
5%. 
However, 
statistical 
tests 
for 
secondary 
and 
exploratory 
variables 
were 
considered 
to 
be 
exploratory 
in 
nature 
only. 
Major protocol deviations 
The 
following 
protocol 
deviations 
were 
considered 
as 
major 
and 
were 
lead 
to 
exclusion 
of 
patients/ 
data 
from 
the 
per-
protocol 
analysis 
of 
efficacy: 
 
Have 
not 
demonstrated 
either 
reversible 
airway 
obstruction 
or 
airways 
hyper-
reactivity 
within 
the 
last 
5 
years, 
or 
at 
screening

Rules for calculations related to ACQ 
 
The 
ACQ 
measured 
asthma 
symptom 
control 
and 
consisted 
of 
7 
items: 
5 
on 
symptom 
assessment, 
1 
on 
rescue 
bronchodilator 
use 
and 
1 
on 
airway 
calibre 
(FEV1 
% 
predicted). 
All 
7 
questions 
of 
the 
ACQ 
were 
equally 
weighted. 
Items 
1-
6 
were 
scored 
along 
a 
7-
point 
response 
scale, 
where 
0 
= 
good 
controlled 
and 
6 
= 
poor 
controlled. 
Question 
7 
dealt 
with 
FEV1 
% 
predicted 
pre-
bronchodilator. 
In 
case 
the 
values 
of 
FEV1 
% 
predicted 
pre-
bronchodilator 
were 
also 
available 
from 
the 
central 
spirometry 
reading 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
ACQ 
Q7 
from 
CRF, 
the 
central 
reading 
was 
used 
to 
derive 
the 
ACQ 
score. 
The 
value 
of 
ACQ 
Q7 
was 
used 
only 
if 
the 
central 
reading 
was 
not 
available. 
The 
7th 
item 
on 
% 
predicted 
FEV1 
(pre-
bronchodilator) 
was 
scored 
by 
clinic 
staff 
on 
a 
7-
point 
scale 
(0 
– 
> 
95-
 
99%;

4 
– 
60-
69%; 
5 
– 
50-
59%; 
6 
– 
< 
50%). 
 
The 
average 
score 
of 
the 
7 
questions 
at 
each 
visit 
was 
calculated 
as 
the 
sum 
of 
scores 
divided 
by 
the 
number 
of 
questions 
that 
were 
answered 
by 
the 
patient 
at 
the 
visit, 
as 
long 
as 
there 
were 
at 
least 
6 
questions 
answered 
and 
the 
missing 
item 
was 
neither 
question 
1 
nor 
question 
7. 
If 
a 
measure 
of 
FEV1 
% 
predicted 
pre-
bronchodilator 
was 
missing 
in 
the 
central 
spirometry 
data, 
then 
we 
got 
it 
from 
the 
ACQ 
Q7 
in 
CRF. 
The 
ACQ 
score 
was 
then 
calculated 
as 
the 
sum 
of 
scores 
divided 
by 
the 
number 
of 
questions 
that 
were 
answered 
by 
the 
patient 
at 
the 
visit, 
as 
long 
as 
there 
were 
at 
least 
6 
questions 
answered 
and 
preferable 
not 
question 
1(night 
time 
awakenings) 
or

For

item, 
the 
recommended 
method 
for

was 
to

for

was 
(6+5+0+4+0+2.63+6)/7=3.38 
 
It 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
a 
post-
treatment 
missing 
data 
could 
only 
be 
imputed 
using 
a 
post 
treatment 
visit, 
and 
a 
missing 
value 
at 
baseline 
(visit 
3) 
could 
only 
be 
interpolated 
using 
a 
value 
from 
Visit 
2. 
That 
is, 
if 
the 
missing 
was 
at 
baseline 
(visit 
3), 
then 
we 
could 
only 
do 
backward 
interpolation 
using 
Visit 
2 
and 
if 
we 
had 
missing 
data 
on 
Visit 
4, 
we 
could 
only 
do 
forward 
interpolation 
using 
Visit 
5. 
If 
Visit 
5 
had 
data 
missing 
then 
we 
could 
do 
forward 
as 
well 
as 
backward 
interpolation 
using 
either 
Visit

or

Rules on calculations related to Asthma Quality of Life (AQLQs) 
 
AQLQ 
was 
a 
32-

disease

questionnaire, 
each 
answered 
on 
a 
7-

scale 
(1 
= 
totally 
limited/problems 
all 
the 
time, 
7 
=

all 
limited/no

The

were 
calculated

Overall 
Score 
= 
Mean 
of 
Items 
1 
to 
32 
(32 
items) 
Each 
item 
of 
the 
AQLQ 
was 
equally 
weighted 
and 
scored 
along 
a 
7-
point 
scale, 
where 
1 
indicated 
maximal 
impairment 
and 
7 
indicates 
no 
impairment. 
Thus, 
higher 
scores 
indicated 
better 
asthma-
related 
HRQOL. 
There 
was 
a 
mean 
score 
calculated 
for 
each 
of 
the 
four 
domains, 
as 
well 
as 
an 
overall 
quality-
of-
life 
score, 
which 
was 
the 
mean 
score 
of 
all 
32 
items. 
The 
resultant 
overall 
scores 
were 
between 
1 
and 
7. 
The 
developer 
suggested 
no 
more 
than 
10% 
of missing 
data. 
This means 
that 
for 
a 
questionnaire 
of 
32 
items, 
no 
more 
than 
3 
items 
should 
be 
missing. 
 
Further, 
for 
the 
activity 
and 
symptom 
domains, 
the 
recommendation 
was 
no 
more 
than 
1 
missing 
value 
per 
domain. 
For 
the 
emotional 
function 
and 
environmental 
stimuli 
domains, 
no 
missing 
responses 
at 
all. 
 
 
The 
recommended 
method 
for 
handling 
missing 
data 
to 
reduce 
the 
risk 
of 
bias 
was 
to 
interpolate (pro-
rate) missing values using either previous or subsequent completed 
questionnaires 
per 
domain, 
in 
a 
similar 
way 
as 
described 
in 
the 
previous 
section 
for 
the 
analysis 
of 
ACQ.

1. Study Design 
 
This is a single-centre double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group randomised study examining 
the effect of orally administered QAW039 225 mg b.i.d for 12 weeks as add-on therapy in adults 
with asthma (GINA treatment steps 2-5) and a sputum eosinophilia (≥ 2%).  
 
Visit schedule summarised in Figure 1. For detailed protocol refer to main study protocol. After 
signing informed consent (Visit 1), and screening (Visit 2)(inclusion and exclusion criteria as per 
main study protocol), patients will undergo a 2-week placebo run-in period. At the baseline visit 
(visit 3) all eligible patients will be randomized to QAW039 (225 mg b.i.d.) or placebo for 12 weeks. 
Patients will be assessed after 6 weeks of treatment (visit 4) and at the end of the 12-week treatment 
period (visit 5), all patients will receive placebo during a 6 week washout period (visit 6). Visits to 
assess safety and efficacy will be at weeks 6, 12, and 18 weeks post-randomization i.e. visits 4, 5, 
and 6 with efficacy objectives focussed on the end of the treatment period at week 12 versus baseline 
(i.e. visit 3 versus visit 5).

3. Study objectives 
 
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in the 
sputum eosinophil count after treatment with QAW039 for 12 weeks compared to placebo.  
The secondary objectives include: 
 To demonstrate that QAW039 provides significantly superior control of asthmatic symptoms 
as measured by the asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) compared to placebo in the group as 
a whole (and in those with poor control at baseline defined by ACQ ≥1.5). 
 To assess safety and tolerability of QAW039. 
 
The exploratory objectives include: 
 To demonstrate that QAW039 provides significant improvement in standard physiological 
markers including pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1, as well as specific small airway 
markers measured with multiple breath washout (MBW) and impulse oscillometry, namely 
Sacin, R5-R20 and AX, compared to placebo.  
 To explore whether the efficacious effect of QAW039 therapy persists following the 
cessation of therapy. 
 To explore whether quantitative computed tomography (CT) biomarkers at baseline predict 
response to therapy with QAW039. 
 To explore changes in air trapping, as evaluated by quantitative computed tomography (CT), 
after 12 weeks of treatment with QAW039 versus placebo. 
 To explore changes in health-related quality of life as measured by the Asthma Quality of 
Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) after 12 weeks of treatment with QAW039 versus placebo. 
 To explore changes in blood mediators and transcriptomic profile by RNAseq following 12 
weeks of treatment with QAW039 versus placebo. Further analyses led by Professor Ivo Gut. 
 To explore the effect of QAW039 on ventilation heterogeneity, as measured by 
hyperpolarised helium-3 MRI (He-3 MRI), compared to placebo. Further analyses to be 
undertaken by University of Sheffield led by Professor Wild. 
 To explore whether QAW039 attenuates eosinophilic airway inflammation as measured by 
bronchial biopsies, compared to placebo. 
 To explore whether QAW039 attenuates airway inflammation and features of remodelling in 
bronchial biopsies (including but not limited to the assessment of histological features of 
inflammatory and goblet cell number, reticular basement membrane thickness and assessment 
of collagen deposition) compared to placebo. 
 To assess the change in parameters generated by Functional Respiratory Imaging (FRI): 
(specific) airway volumes, (specific) airway resistances, lung volumes and associated 
measures of hyperinflation at both functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung capacity 
(TLC) following treatment with QAW039 versus placebo. Analyses to be undertaken by 
AirPROM partner Fluidda and further details are provided in annex I. 
 Responder analyses to determine predictors of response defined as a continuous variable for 
all subjects in the active arm for relative percentage change in sputum eosinophil count, 
ACQ, and FEV1 (both pre and post bronchodilator) and responders versus non-responders 
defined as >50% relative change in sputum eosinophil count, >0.5 ACQ, and >120ml FEV1 
(both pre- and post-bronchodilator). 
 Genome wide analysis with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) associated with baseline 
characteristics and response. Led by Professor Tobin and Gut see Annex II for further details. 
 Development and validation of multi-scale models in AirPROM as per AirPROM description 
of work (www.airprom.eu)

3. Data analysis 
 
Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS 20 (IBM Corporation, Somers, New York, USA) 
Prism 6 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, California, USA) and in R (R Core Team (2013). R: A 
language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, 
Austria.URL http://www.R-project.org/.).  
The full analysis data set (FAS) or intention-to-treat (ITT) will include all randomized patients who 
received at least one dose of study drug. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they 
received. All participants who are randomized will be included in the ITT population, and missing 
data due to withdrawals or otherwise will be imputed using the last observation carried forward. 
Participants who completed the study up to the post-treatment visit (Visit 5) without major protocol 
deviations will be included in the per-protocol population (PP). Outcomes will be assessed primarily 
in the PP population and supported by analysis of the ITT population or FAS.  
The primary outcome of the study is the change in sputum eosinophil percentage between the 
baseline visit (Visit 3) and the post-treatment visit (Visit 5). As sputum eosinophil percentage is 
known to follow a log-normal distribution, the analysis will be based on a log10-transformed scale. 
To observe a between group post intervention 50% difference in sputum eosinophil percentage, 
(equivalent to an absolute reduction in log10 sputum eosinophil percentage of 0.301) with 80% at a 
5% level requires 21 subjects in each group. With 30 patients per arm to be randomized, we expect 
24 patients to complete the post-treatment assessments, assuming a 20% dropout rate during the 
course of the treatment phase.  
To address the objectives in section 2, outcomes will be assessed at weeks 6, 12, and 18 weeks post-
randomization i.e. visits 4, 5, and 6 compared to visit 3 with analysis of endpoints primarily focussed 
on the end of the treatment period at week 12 versus baseline (i.e. visit 3 versus visit 5). Analyses 
will be undertaken for all the endpoints listed in Table 1. Following checking for normality 
assumption using a Q-Q plot of residuals, Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, between-
group and within-group comparisons will be made for the mean change between baseline values 
(visit 3) and values at week 6 (visit 4), week 12 (visit 5), and week 18 (visit 6), with the use of 
unpaired and paired t-tests, respectively, for parametric distributions and the Mann–Whitney U test 
and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for nonparametric distributions. Between-group comparisons will be 
carried out using unpaired tests, while paired tests will be used in within-group comparisons. 
Proportions will be compared with the use of Fisher's exact test.  
Responder analysis will determine predictors in responder versus non-responder groups for the 
efficacy outcomes sputum eosinophils, ACQ and pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1. Response will 
also be considered as a continuous variable and correlated with baseline values and change in other 
outcomes i.e. delta versus delta associations. In addition to this an unsupervised cluster responder 
statistical model will be carried out.  This model will use multiple outcomes of the trial to determine 
if specific latent responder clusters can be determined.  The derived cluster membership can then go 
on to be deep phenotyped using the rest of the variables to determine specific biomarkers that relate 
to the clusters and thus can predict the drug response for patients.    
Structural equation modelling will be carried out on the baseline data to obtain models that contain 
casual links between variables. Information of the causal links will be found from the literature and 
will be verified in the structural equation modelling along with existing structural equation models 
using previous data, in order to create a predictive casual model of clinical outcomes of asthma at 
baseline.  The parameters of the structural equation model can then be tested after treatment with 
placebo and drug to determine the parameters that have changed furthering evidence of disease 
mechanism changes.  The results once established can then be tested in a simpler manner through 
hypothesis testing.
