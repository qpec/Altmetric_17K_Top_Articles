IMPORTANCE More than 30 million people live with a stroke diagnosis worldwide. Depression
after stroke is frequent, and greater knowledge of associated risk factors and outcomes is
needed to understand the etiology and implications of this disabling complication.
OBJECTIVES To examine whether the incidence of and risk factors for depression differ
between patients with stroke and a reference population without stroke and to assess how
depression influences mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Register-based cohort study in Denmark. Participants
were all individuals 15 years or older with a first-time hospitalization for stroke between
January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2011 (n = 157 243), and a reference population
(n = 160 236) matched on age, sex, and municipality. The data were analyzed between
January and March 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The incidence of depression and mortality outcomes of
depression (defined by hospital discharge diagnoses or antidepressant medication use) were
examined using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses.
RESULTS In total, 34 346 patients (25.4%) with stroke and 11 330 (7.8%) in the reference
population experienced depression within 2 years after study entry. Compared with the
reference population, patients with stroke had a higher incidence of depression during the
first 3 months after hospitalization (hazard ratio for stroke vs the reference population, 8.99;
95% CI, 8.61-9.39), which declined during the second year of follow-up (hazard ratio for
stroke vs the reference population, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.85-2.08). Significant risk factors for
depression for patients with stroke and the reference population included older age, female
sex, single cohabitation status, basic educational attainment, diabetes, high level of somatic
comorbidity, history of depression, and stroke severity (in patients with stroke). The
associations were strongest for the reference population. In both populations, depressed
individuals, especially those with new onset, had increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio
for new-onset depression, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.83-1.95] for patients with stroke and 3.75 [95% CI,
3.51-4.00] for the reference population) after adjustment for confounders. Similar patterns
were found for natural and unnatural causes of death. In most models, the depression-related
relative mortality was approximately twice as high in the reference population vs the stroke
population.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Depression is common in patients with stroke during the first
year after diagnosis, and those with prior depression or severe stroke are especially at risk.
Because a large number of deaths can be attributable to depression after stroke, clinicians
should be aware of this risk.

I
n 2013, more than 10 million people had a stroke, and in
excess of 30 million people lived with a stroke diagnosis
worldwide.1 Depression is common after stroke, and
studies2-13 have evaluated its frequency, risk factors, and mor-
tality. However, recent systematic reviews2-4,9,13 of more than
50 cohorts have been hampered by heterogeneity across stud-
ies and small sample sizes; consequently, the reported fre-
quency of depression after stroke has varied from 2% to 55%
in population-based cohorts,2-4,13 with pooled estimates be-
tween29%and31%inrecentmeta-analyses.3,4Only2studies5,6
(with sample sizes <300) examining the risk of depression af-
ter stroke included a reference population selected from the
community, and they indicated that, although depression is
more common after stroke than in control individuals, the dif-
ferences were not substantial and had largely disappeared
after 1 year.
While a history of depression, stroke severity, and disabil-
ity consistently have been associated with increased risk of
depression after stroke, evidence for an association between
depression after stroke and sociodemographic factors, life-
style, or stroke features, such as subtype, is lacking.4,7-11,13,14
Furthermore, most studies of risk factors have had insuffi-
cient sample size to detect small effects, to allow stable mul-
tiple regression analyses, or to explore whether stroke sub-
type or time of depression onset modifies the influence of
potential risk factors.
A recent meta-analysis12 of 13 studies revealed increased
mortality in patients with depression after stroke, with a haz-
ard ratio (HR) for mortality of 1.52 (95% CI, 1.01-2.26). The as-
sociation seemed to be related to length of follow-up, with the
HRs largest for follow-up less than 2 years (HR, 4.40; 95% CI,
1.75-11.09) and smallest for follow-up exceeding 5 years (HR,
1.28; 95% CI, 0.99-0.65). None of the studies compared the
mortality rate in patients with depression after stroke with a
depressed reference population.
Comparing incidence, risk factors, and mortality related
todepressionamongpatientswithstrokeandareferencepopu-
lation would provide better understanding of the mecha-
nisms and consequences of depression after stroke. There-
fore, the aims of this population-based cohort study were to
test the following hypotheses: (1) depression is more fre-
quentinpatientsafterstrokethaninamatchedreferencepopu-
lation, (2) risk factors for depression after stroke depend on
stroke subtype and time of depression onset, and (3) depres-
sion after stroke has other risk factors than those associated
with depression in a matched reference population. Further-
more, based on our findings in a previous study15 of patients
with acute coronary syndrome, we also hypothesized that de-
pression would be less strongly associated with mortality from
all, natural, and unnatural causes in patients with stroke than
in the reference population.
Methods
Data Sources
This register-based cohort study was based on linkage of data
from the following 7 Danish nationwide registers: the Danish
National Patient Registry, Danish Psychiatric Central Regis-
ter, Danish Stroke Register, Danish Register of Causes of
Death, Register of Medicinal Products Statistics, Danish Civil
Registration System, and Population’
s Education Register.16
ThestudywasapprovedbytheDanishDataProtectionAgency.
All data were retrieved from administrative registers, and in-
formed consent was not required of participants.
Study Population
All first-time hospitalizations for stroke in individuals 15 years
or older occurring in Denmark between January 1, 2001, and
December31,2011(n = 157 243)wereincludedinthestudy.The
data were analyzed between January and March 2016. Pa-
tients with stroke and transient ischemic attack were identi-
fied in the Danish National Patient Registry and the Danish
Stroke Register by the following International Statistical Clas-
sification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Re-
vision (ICD-10) codes: I61 (hemorrhagic stroke), I63 (ischemic
stroke), I64 (unspecified stroke), and G45 (transient ischemic
attack). The Danish Stroke Register was initiated in 2003 and
provides information on selected stroke features for 53 046 pa-
tientswithstroke.17Acomparablereferencegroup(n = 160 236)
was sampled from the reference population by 1:1 matching
on age, sex, and municipality on time of stroke diagnosis using
information from the Danish Civil Registration System.
Depression
Depression was defined by a depression diagnosis in the Dan-
ish Psychiatric Central Register, Danish National Patient Reg-
istry,orDanishRegisterofCausesofDeath(ICD-10codesF31.3-
F34.1) or by filling of antidepressant prescriptions in the
Register of Medicinal Products Statistics by Anatomic Thera-
peutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System code N06A as de-
scribed in a previous study.15 Study entry was defined as the
date of stroke admission or matching. To comply with previ-
ous studies,3,11 the study population was followed up for in-
cident depression, categorized as early depression occurring
within 3 months after study entry, intermediate depression oc-
curring between 3 months and 1 year after study entry, and late
depression occurring between 1 and 2 years after study entry.
Current depression was a depression diagnosis within the last
Key Points
Question Do the incidence of and risk factors for depression differ
between patients with stroke and a population without stroke and
how does depression after stroke influence mortality?
Findings In this register-based cohort study of 157 243 patients
with a first-time stroke, the incidence of depression during the first
3 months after stroke was 8 times higher than in a population
without stroke, and depression after stroke was associated with
prior depression and stroke severity. Absolute mortality rates were
higher for all depression states in both populations, but relative
mortality was lower in patients with stroke.
Meaning The high mortality associated with depression after
stroke indicates that clinicians should be aware of this frequent
comorbidity.

100 days before study entry. Previous depression was a de-
pression diagnosis from 100 days up to 5 years before study
entry. In analyses with mortality as outcome, we separated in-
cident depression into recurrent (those with a previous de-
pression diagnosis) and new onset (those without a previous
depression diagnosis). We also examined whether type of di-
agnosis definition (ICD-10 codes or ATC code) influenced in-
cidence and mortality outcomes and performed a sensitivity
analysis that excluded individuals diagnosed as having de-
pression based on a single filling of an antidepressant prescrip-
tion.
Mortality
Information on all-cause mortality and death from natural and
unnatural (suicides, homicides, and accidents) causes was re-
corded. These data were obtained from the Danish Civil Reg-
istration System and the Danish Register of Causes of Death.
Potential Risk Factors
Based on previous reviews on risk factors for depression,7-9 we
included information on age, sex, and marital status ob-
tained from the Danish Civil Registration System and data on
highest achieved school education from the Population’
s Edu-
cation Register. Education was grouped into basic (grades 7-9
of obligatory schooling) and higher (high school, vocational di-
ploma, or higher) education. Information on year of hospital
admission was retrieved from the Danish National Patient
Registry. Furthermore, type 1 and type 2 diabetes and other
somatic comorbidities (coronary heart disease, chronic ob-
structivepulmonarydisease,obesity,migraine,dementia,can-
cer, kidney, and connective tissue or inflammatory diseases)
were identified 5 years before study entry by ICD-10 codes and
ATC code as previously described.15 From the Danish Stroke
Register, we included information on smoking, alcohol con-
sumption, and stroke severity. Stroke severity was measured
bythevalidatedScandinavianNeurologicalStrokeScale,which
rates physical disabilities,18 and based on findings from pre-
vious prediction investigations,19 we categorized patients into
the following 4 stroke groups: severe (0-19 points), moderate
(20-39 points), mild (40-49 points), and very mild (50-59
points).
Statistical Analysis
Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to
analyze (1) the incidence of depression after study entry, (2)
associationsbetweenpotentialriskfactorsanddepression,and
(3) associations between depression and mortality. Individu-
als were observed from baseline and followed up until depres-
sion diagnosis, emigration, death, stroke (6766 from the ref-
erence group), or end of follow-up (3 months, 1 year, or 2 years
after study entry), whichever came first. Individuals with cur-
rent depression were excluded from analyses of incidence and
risk factors because they were not at risk of developing de-
pression.Inthemortalityanalyses,individualswhodiedwithin
7 days after study entry (9818 cases and 1 from the reference
group) were excluded, and depression was entered as a time-
dependent variable by splitting the data set on time of de-
pression onset, with the influence of early and intermediate
depression onset on subsequent mortality also examined. Fol-
low-up was initiated 7 days, 3 months, and 1 year after study
entry. Confounders were identified using the directed acyclic
graphs in eFigure 1 and eFigure 2 in the Supplement. Log-
minus-log curves tested the proportional hazards assump-
tion and showed no signs of violation. Interactions were tested

A significance level of 5% was used, and analyses were per-
formed with statistical software programs (Stata, version14;
StataCorp LP and SAS, version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Incidence of Depression
At study entry, 21 826 patients (13.9%) with stroke and 14 737
(9.2%) in the reference population had a current depression
diagnosis and were not included in the analyses (Table 1). Of
the remaining 135 417 patients with stroke, 34 346 (25.4%) had
a depression diagnosis within 2 years after stroke (incidence
rate[IR],198.0;95%CI,191.0-195.1per1000person-years),and
more than half of the cases (n = 17 690) appeared within the
first 3 months (IR, 601.7; 95% CI, 529.7-611.0). In the refer-
ence population (n = 145 499), 11 330 (7.8%) had a depression
diagnosis within 2 years after study entry (IR, 41.5; 95 % CI,
40.7-42.3), and less than one-fourth of cases (n = 2449)
appeared within the first 3 months (IR, 66.4; 95% CI, 63.8-
69.1). In the Cox proportional hazards regression analyses,
the HRs comparing the IRs in patients with stroke and the
reference population were 8.99 (95% CI, 8.61-9.39) after 3
months and 1.93 (95% CI, 1.85-2.08) in the second year of
follow-up. Adjustment for confounders only attenuated the
HRs slightly. The results were similar in analyses restricted
to the 5231 patients with stroke and 807 in the reference
population defined as being depressed by an ICD-10 code
but excluding depression based on a single filling of an anti-
depressant prescription.

depression, and more than 2 somatic comorbidities were all
associated with higher rates of depression in both popula-
tions (Table 2). However, interaction analyses indicated that
all associations were stronger in the reference population
than in patients with stroke, especially for a history of
depression and the number of somatic comorbidities. The
patterns of association were almost the same for early, inter-
mediate, and late depression onset except for year of diag-
nosis, for which the HR increased for early depression,
while a slight decrease was observed for intermediate and
late depression (eTable 2 in the Supplement). In patients
with stroke, we also examined the influence of stroke sub-
type, lifestyle, and stroke severity (Table 3). The risk of
depression was 3 times lower in patients with transient
ischemic attack compared with those with a stroke diagno-
sis. Stroke severity and current smoking were also associ-
ated with increased risk of depression after stroke, whereas
alcohol consumption above the recommendations (>7
drinks per week for women and >14 drinks per week for
men) was not. There was a stepwise increase in the risk of
depression after stroke for increased stroke severity, with
P < .001 for trend. The results were similar when analyses
were repeated for depression defined only by ICD-10 codes
or stratified by ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.
Timing of Depression and Mortality
During follow-up (range, 7 days to 2 years), 33 210 patients
(22.5%) with stroke and 11 365 individuals (7.1%) in the refer-
ence population died (a total of 9818 cases who died within
the first 7 days were excluded). In both populations, mortal-
ity was increased in individuals with previous, recurrent, cur-
rent, and new-onset depression (Table 4). The estimates were
similar for younger and older patients. While absolute mor-
tality was higher in patients with stroke than in the reference
population, relative mortality was significantly lower in pa-
tients with stroke than in the reference population for all in-
cident depression states. The analyses were repeated for natu-
ral and unnatural causes of deaths, with similar findings for
natural deaths. Because the number of deaths from unnatu-
ral causes was small (n = 1118), the HRs were consequently im-
precisely estimated. The patterns of association were almost
the same for mortality within 3 months, 3 months to 1 year,
and 1 to 2 years (eTable 3 and eTable 4 in the Supplement). In
patients with stroke, the mortality rate for patients with new-
onset depression within the first 3 months was similar to the
mortality rate for patients with later depression onset. For the
reference population, the mortality rate was highest for early
new-onset depression (Table 5).
Discussion
In this study that included 157 243 patients with first-time
stroke and a matched population-based reference group, the
incidence of depression after stroke was 8 times higher in the
first 3 months and then approximated the level for the refer-
ence population after 1 and 2 years. A range of risk factors was
associated with higher rates of depression in both popula-
tions,withstrongestrelativeassociationsinthereferencepopu-
lation. We found increased mortality from all, natural, and
unnatural causes in previous, recurrent, current, and new-
onset depression compared with no depression in both popu-
lations. Absolute mortality rates were higher in all subgroups
of patients with stroke, but relative mortality associated with
depression was significantly lower.
Incidence of Depression
In our study, the percentage of patients with stroke with inci-
dent depression after 2 years was comparable to that re-
ported in previous population-based studies (22%) or studies
with more than 1 year of follow-up (25%).4 The risk of depres-
sion in patients with stroke was 4 times higher than in the ref-
erence population, was highest after 3 months, and leveled off
but remained significantly higher after 1 year. To date, only 2
smaller, population-based studies have included a reference
population, which found the frequency of depression in pa-
tients with stroke to be approximately twice that in a refer-
encepopulation,withnosignificantdifferenceafter6months5
or 1 year,6 potentially owing to lack of statistical power. A few
studies4,20,21 have compared the risk of depression in pa-
tients with stroke with the risk in patients with other somatic
diseases and found the largest risk in patients with stroke. In
another Danish study,21 patients with stroke had 3 times higher

Risk Factors for Depression
More than 20 studies, including 18 000 patients, have exam-
ined different risk factors for depression after stroke, and in
accord with the present study, most studies4,7-9 have shown
that a history of depression and stroke severity are associated
with depression after stroke. Female sex was associated with
depression after stroke in 8 of 18 studies and older age in only
3 of 16 studies. Similarly, no consistent associations have been
found in the few studies on the influence of low education (1
of 3 studies), single cohabitation status (2 of 5 studies), smok-
ing (0 of 2 studies), or concomitant physical illness (0 of 3 stud-
ies) on depression after stroke. In support of the studies show-
ing an association, we found that older age, female sex, single
cohabitation status, basic educational attainment, and high
level of somatic comorbidity were associated with depres-
sion in patients with stroke, as well as in the reference popu-
lation. During the study period from 2001 through 2011, we
saw an increase in diagnosis of depression within 3 months of
stroke. This trend seems comparable to the results from a re-
cent study22 of time trends in depression diagnosis after acute
coronary syndrome in Denmark between 2001 and 2009
and might be explained by increased focus on depression in
these groups of patients. No other studies, to our knowl-
edge, seem to have compared risk factors for depression
after stroke with depression risk factors in a reference popu-
lation. However, our study showed that risk estimates for
the above variables were weaker than those seen in the ref-
erence population, which might suggest a difference in eti-
ology or reflect the general increased risk of depression in
patients with stroke.
Depression and Mortality
Our study revealed increased all-cause mortality in individu-
als with previous, recurrent, current, and new-onset depres-
sion, which is supported by a meta-analysis12 examining the
influence of depression after stroke on subsequent mortality.
However, previous studies that included prospective sur-
vival analyses have been small (with sample sizes <800) and
have not distinguished between depression states or ad-
justed for potential confounders. In a recent study (n = 1354),23
depression was only associated with increased mortality in pa-
tients with stroke younger than 65 years. To our knowledge,
no previous studies have examined the association for spe-

cific causes of death or compared the estimates for patients
with stroke with the mortality risk for depression in a refer-
ence population.
The increase in the incidence of depression within the
first months after stroke diagnosis, as well as the weaker
associations with acknowledged risk factors for depression
and subsequent mortality, suggests that depression after
stroke differs from depression arising without known prior
somatic illness. There are a number of theories (lesion loca-
tion, vascular depression, neurotransmitter, inflammation,
neuroplasticity, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
activation hypotheses) for the neurobiological pathogenesis
of depression after stroke, with limited and conflicting
evidence.13,24 The results from the present study do not
support any particular theory. Another explanation is
that the rise is owing to increased awareness of depression
after stroke due to screening initiatives and prophylactic
treatment with antidepressants. The discussions of prevent-
ing depression after stroke and improving outcomes overall
by initiating prophylactic antidepressant treatment soon
after stroke diagnosis13 might have increased prescription of
antidepressants among neurologists.25 However, a 2013
meta-analysis26 did not provide sufficient evidence for treat-
ment effects, and in observational studies selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor treatment after stroke has been associated
with higher mortality23,27 independent of depression
diagnosis.23 This finding has recently been highlighted28 and
might have contributed to a more conservative treatment
strategy.
Our study has both strengths and limitations. We ob-

findings. Also, information on stroke and depression was
retrieved from registers with high validity for stroke
registration.29,30 However, our definition of depression was
based on psychiatric diagnoses and antidepressant prescrip-
tions, and most cases were defined by filling of antidepres-
sant prescriptions. Such drugs may be prescribed for various
diseases, and single prescriptions have been found more
frequently in individuals with no recorded depression
diagnosis.31 Consequently, we performed a sensitivity analy-
sis based on more than 1 filling of an antidepressant prescrip-
tion to limit this potential misclassification. These analyses
produced results similar to those presented. Furthermore,
when we repeated analyses with the inclusion of only cases
with a hospital diagnosis of depression, the results were simi-
lar. Finally, the Danish Stroke Register did not include infor-
mation on lesion location or biochemical features; conse-
quently, we could only provide indirect support for possible
etiologic mechanisms. Future studies should examine how
potential biomarkers relate to the co-occurrence of stroke
and depression.
Conclusions
Depression is common in patients with stroke the first year af-
ter occurrence, with patients with prior depression or severe
stroke being at highest risk. Incident depression after stroke
isanindependentriskfactorformortalityfromnaturalandun-
natural causes. However, the association between depres-
sion and risk factors and mortality from both natural and un-
natural causes was weaker in patients with stroke than in a
matched reference population, which suggests different etio-
logic mechanisms. Assuming causality, the high rates of de-
pression in patients with stroke indicate that a large number
of deaths occurring during rehabilitation may be attributable
to this condition, which suggests that clinicians should re-
main vigilant concerning this risk, especially in patients with
a history of depression and a high number of somatic comor-
bidities. We suggest that future clinical studies should focus
on how treatment and rehabilitation influence the risk of de-
pression in patients with stroke.
