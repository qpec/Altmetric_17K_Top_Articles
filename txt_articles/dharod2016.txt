IMPORTANCE Bradycardia has been associated with lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in
selected populations. There is a paucity of information available about heart rate (HR) less
than 50 beats per minute (bpm) among middle-aged or older adults.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether asymptomatic bradycardia was associated with a lower
cardiovascular risk profile, less subclinical atherosclerosis, and decreased incident CVD and
mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective analysis includes 6733 participants of
the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, which recruited men and women free of clinical
cardiovascular disease ages 45 to 84 years from 2000 to 2002 and followed them over 10
years for incident CVD events and mortality. The HR was measured by baseline
electrocardiogram. The analysis was performed in June 2014.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The association between HR categories with CVD events
and all-cause mortality were examined using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for
potential confounders and mediators.
RESULTS The 6733 participants had a mean (SD) age of 62 (10.2) years; 47% were male.
The mean (SD) HR was 63 (9.5) bpm among the 5831 participants not taking an HR-modifying
drug; 5.3% had an HR lower than 50 bpm. Preliminary results revealed significant interaction
for HR categories according to use of HR-modifying drugs for mortality (P = .002); thus, all
further analyses were stratified. An HR of less than 50 bpm was not associated with incident
CVD in either subgroup (participants taking or not taking HR-modifying drugs). Among
participants not taking HR-modifying drugs, the fully adjusted mortality risk was not different
for an HR less than 50 bpm (hazard ratio, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.41-1.09]; P = .12) and increased
among those with an HR greater than 80 bpm (hazard ratio, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.08-2.05]; P = .01)
(reference HR, 60-69 bpm). Among the 902 participants taking HR-modifying drugs there
was an elevated mortality risk associated with an HR less than 50 bpm (hazard ratio, 2.42
[95% CI, 1.39-4.20]; P = .002) and with an HR greater than 80 bpm (hazard ratio, 3.55 [95%
CI, 1.65-7.65]; P = .001) (reference HR, 60-69 bpm).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a contemporary, community-based cohort, bradycardia
was generally not associated with incident CVD or mortality except for a potential adverse
association between bradycardia among those taking HR-modifying drugs.

radycardia has traditionally been defined as a heart rate
(HR) of less than 60 beats per minute (bpm) or an HR
of less than 501-3 bpm. Multiple studies demonstrate
that higher resting HR (RHR) predicts poor cardiovascular out-
comes both independent of conventional risk factors and
within subgroups of patients with cardiovascular disease.4-11
Restingheartratehasbeendemonstratedtobemodifiableover
time with respect to the interaction of genes12 and environ-
mental factors such as exercise,13,14 medical conditions and
medications. However, the impact of bradycardia is less clear.
Bradycardia often is found in athletic adults and is typically
asymptomatic.15 Among nonathletes, whether persons with
bradycardia have higher levels of cardiovascular fitness, or ab-
normalities in the conduction system is unclear. Particularly
among the elderly population, some with bradycardia have
symptoms (eg, fatigue, syncope) requiring pacemaker implan-
tation. Tresch and Fleg16 examined a sample (n = 96) and re-
ported that sinus bradycardia (HR <50 bpm) in apparently
healthy, nonathletic individuals older than 40 years showed
no association with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
Other studies10,17,18 suggested that asymptomatic bradycar-
dia may be associated with modestly reduced cardiovascular
disease (CVD) mortality. Kolloch et al19 examined the relation-
ship of RHR to adverse events, including mortality, in pa-
tients with coronary artery disease treated with either verap-
amiloratenolol,anddemonstratedasmallincreaseinriskwith
an HR less than 50 bpm. Nauman et al20 found that the asso-
ciation of change in RHR with ischemic heart disease mortal-
itywasnotlinear(P = .003forquadratictrend),suggestingthat
a decrease in RHR showed no general mortality benefit.
We sought to investigate the association between brady-
cardia and risk factors, subclinical atherosclerosis, incident
CVD, and mortality in a contemporary, well-characterized co-
hort free of clinical CVD at baseline. We hypothesized that
asymptomatic bradycardia was associated with a lower CV risk
profile, less subclinical atherosclerosis, and decreased inci-
dent CVD and mortality.

Baseline Measurements
During the baseline examination (2000-2002), standardized
questionnairesandstandardcalibrateddeviceswereusedtoob-

its, medical conditions, current prescription medication use,
weight,waistcircumference,andheight.WeusedtheMESATypi-

andconditioninginmetabolicequivalent(MET)hoursperweek.21
We also assessed for any vigorous physical activity (defined as
MET level >6). Alcohol use was coded as current/former/never.

Electrocardiographic Data
A resting standard 12-lead ECG was obtained from fasting par-
ticipants using a GE/Marquette MAC 1200 electrocardio-
graph. The HR was obtained from the ECG rhythm tracing. The
total number of beats in 10 seconds (variable for each partici-
pant) was used to calculate the beats per minute. The ECGs
were centrally read and coded at the Epidemiological Cardi-
ologyResearchCenter(EPICARE),WakeForestSchoolofMedi-
cine (Winston-Salem, North Carolina). The Minnesota24 cod-
ingsystemwasusedtoclassifyECGabnormalities.Participants
with only minor ECG abnormalities were classified as having
“any minor abnormalities,” and participants with major ab-
normalities with or without coexisting minor abnormalities
were classified as having “any major ECG abnormalities.” Mi-
nor ECG abnormalities included minor isolated Q/-QS waves,
minor isolated ST/-T abnormalities, high R waves, ST seg-
ment elevation; incomplete (left and right) bundle branch
block, minor QT prolongation (QTi ≥112%), short PR interval,
left axis deviation, right axis deviation, frequent ventricular
premature beats, and other minor arrhythmias. Major ECG ab-
normalitiesincludedmajorventricularconductiondefect;defi-
nite myocardial infarction (defined as the presence of major
Q wave abnormalities); possible myocardial infarction (de-
fined as the presence of minor Q/-QS wave plus major ST/-T
abnormalities); major isolated -ST/-T abnormalities; left ven-
tricular hypertrophy; major atrioventricular conduction ab-
normalities; and major QT prolongation (QT≥116%), pace-
maker, and other major arrhythmias.

Outcomes
Thecohortwasfollowedforincidentcardiovasculareventsand
mortality at 9- to 12-month intervals; a telephone inter-
viewer contacted each participant to inquire about all in-
terim hospital admissions, cardiovascular outpatient diagno-
sesandprocedures,anddeaths.Inaddition,MESAoccasionally
identified additional events through cohort clinic visits, par-
ticipant call-ins, medical record abstractions, or obituaries. To
verify self-reported diagnoses, MESA requested copies of all
death certificates and medical records for all hospitalizations
and selected outpatient cardiovascular diagnoses and proce-
dures. MESA also obtained next-of-kin interviews for out-of-
hospital cardiovascular deaths. MESA was successful in get-
ting hospital records on an estimated 99% of suspected
hospitalizedcardiovascularevents.Cardiovasculareventswere
adjudicated centrally by a physician panel. For these analy-
ses, CVD was a composite of myocardial infarction, angina, re-
suscitatedcardiacarrest,stroke(nottransientischemicattack),
coronary heart disease (CHD) death, stroke death, other ath-
erosclerotic death, or other CVD death. Cause of death was as-
signedforpotentialCVDdeathsthroughcommitteereview.For
other deaths, the underlying cause was obtained through state
or city vital statistics departments (or occasionally the Na-
tional Death Index).
Statistical Analysis
Based on prior literature, we defined bradycardia as HR less
50 bpm and grouped HR into 10-bpm increments up to HR
greater than 80 bpm. Continuous baseline characteristics were
summarized using means (standard deviations) and com-
pared using analysis of variance across HR categories. Prelimi-
nary results revealed significant interaction for HR catego-
ries according to use of HR-modifying drugs for mortality
(P < .002); thus, all further analyses were stratified. χ2 Tests
assessed the association between HR category and categori-
cal characteristics. Logistic regression models identified base-
line factors associated with an HR of less than 50. We com-
puted rates of incident CVD and mortality by HR category and
presented 95% CIs. We used Cox regression models to calcu-
late hazard ratios associated with HR categories, picking as the
reference group the category with the lowest event rate. Model
1 adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, alcohol sta-
tus, smoking status, and any vigorous physical activity. Model
2 included model 1 variables and added diabetes mellitus, cho-
lesterol level, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, lipid-
lowering drug use, BMI, creatinine level, and systolic and dia-
stolic BP. Model 3 added HTN medications. Model 4 added CAC
and major ECG abnormalities. We also assessed for interac-
tions between HR and sex, race, and vigorous physical activ-
ity. We used STATA statistical software (version 12; StataCorp
LP) for statistical analyses.
Results
The HR data were available for 6733 participants (mean [SD]
age, 62 [10.2] years; 47% were male; 38% were white; 12%, Chi-
nese; 28%, black; and 22%, Hispanic). The mean (SD) HR was
63 (9.5) bpm among participants not taking an HR-modifying
drug; 5.3% had an HR of less than 50 bpm; 30.3%, an HR of 50
to 59 bpm; 39.8%, an HR of 60 to 69 bpm; 18.8%, an HR of 70
to 79 bpm; and 5.9%, an HR of 80 or greater. The correspond-
ing statistics for participants taking HR-modifying drugs are
as follows: the mean (SD) HR was 60 (9.7) bpm; 11.2% had an
HR of less than 50 bpm; 39.1%, an HR of 50 to 59 bpm; 33.9%,
an HR of 60 to 69 bpm; 11.5%, an HR of 70-79 bpm; and 4.2%,
an HR of 80 bpm or greater. Baseline characteristics for the
sample are depicted in Table 1 and Table 2 according to use of
HR-modifying drugs.
Table 3 shows factors associated with an HR of less than
50 stratified by HR-modifying drug use. First, participants tak-
ingHR-modifyingdrugs(Table2)comparedwiththosenottak-
ingHR-modifyingdrugs(Table1)tendedtobeolder(meanage,
66.2 [9.3] years vs 61.5 [10.2] years) and had a higher esti-
mated Framingham Risk score (0.12 [0.09] vs 0.10 [0.09]), re-
flecting a higher burden of CVD risk factors. A greater propor-
tion had CAC greater than 0 (60.7% vs 48.2%) and were more
likely to have major ECG abnormalities (22.1% vs 11.3%). Sec-
ond, among those not prescribed HR-modifying drugs, par-
ticipants with an HR of less than 50 bpm (Table 3) were more
likely to be male and have some characteristics suggesting
lower CVD risk (lower BMI, less likely to have diabetes melli-
tus, more physically active, lower cholesterol level) but had
higher mean creatinine level and also were more likely to have
ECG abnormalities. In multivariable analyses (Table 3), the fol-
lowing remained independently associated with an HR of less
than 50 bpm: male sex, black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, any
vigorous physical activity, major ECG abnormalities, diabe-
tes, lower BMI, former alcohol use, graduate/professional edu-
cation, higher creatinine level and systolic BP, lower diastolic
BP, and lower level of triglycerides. Prevalence of CAC was not
associated with an HR of less than 50 bpm.
Among the subsample taking HR-modifying drugs, nearly
allwereprescribedHTNmedication.Mostweretakingβ-block-
ers; only 7% were taking either digitalis or other antiarrhyth-
mic drugs (Table 2). Bradycardia was associated with being
male, using β-blockers, and lower mean BMI. Those with an
HR of less than 50 bpm were also less likely diabetic. After mul-
tivariable adjustment, only male sex and BPs remained sta-
tistically significantly associated with an HR of less than 50
bpm (Table 3).
During a median follow-up of 10.1 years (maximum, 11.4
years), 633 incident CVD events occurred (a rate of 10.3 per
1000 person-years). The incidence of CVD was lowest in the
HR category of 50 to 59 bpm in both subgroups, and highest
inthosewithanHRgreaterthan80bpm.TheincidenceofCVD
wasgenerallyhigherinparticipantstakingHR-modifyingdrugs
in all HR categories (see the eFigure in the Supplement). How-
ever, a test for an interaction between HR category and HR-
modifying drug use with CVD events was not significant
(P = .33). Table 4 depicts adjusted hazard ratios for CVD using
those with an HR of 50 to 59 bpm as the reference group. Af-
ter adjustment, the slight excess of CVD events among those
with an HR of less than 50 bpm was not significant (P = .74).
In contrast, CVD risk was consistently statistically signifi-
cantly elevated for those with HR 80 and above.

During follow-up, there were 697 deaths (a rate of 10.5 per
1000person-years);160ofthesewereCVD-relateddeaths,and
537 were non–CVD-related deaths. The mortality rate is de-
picted in the Figure. Mortality was significantly higher in in-
dividuals with an HR of less than 50 bpm (P = .001) and an HR
greater than 80 bpm (P < .001) in patients who used HR-
modifying drugs. A U-shaped distribution for mortality rate is
evident in patients prescribed HR-modifying drugs. In con-
trast, for participants not taking HR-modifying drugs the pat-
tern appeared more linear. For all mortality analyses a P test
for trend was significant.
Table4depictshazardratiocalculationsformortalityusing
the 4 models defined in the Statistical Analysis section. The
reference was an HR of 60 to 69 bpm because mortality was
the lowest in this group. Notably, there seemed to be a linear
increase in hazard ratio with increasing HR categories in pa-
tients not prescribed HR-modifying drugs. In individuals tak-
ing HR-modifying drugs, there was a statistically significant
increase in hazard ratio in participants with an HR of less than
60 and an HR greater than 80 in a J-shaped distribution. Most
notably, the fully adjusted hazard ratios for mortality in indi-
vidualstakingHR-modifyingdrugsforRHRoflessthan50bpm
and HR of 50 to 59 bpm were 2.42 (95% CI, 1.39-4.20; P = .002)
and 1.65 (95% CI, 1.05-2.59; P = .03), respectively.
We did not find significant interactions by sex, race/
ethnicity, or vigorous physical activity. We conducted 2 sensi-
tivity analyses showing consistent patterns. The first sensitiv-
ity analysis defined a healthy cohort not taking HR-modifying
drugs, without HTN, and without major ECG abnormalities.
The second sensitivity analysis defined a group of partici-
pants taking HR-modifying drugs but not taking digoxin or
other antiarrhythmic drugs.

was not uncommon. The crude incidence of CVD was higher
in those with bradycardia, but with adjustment for CVD risk
factors and potential confounders, this excess risk was not
significant. The crude mortality rate was higher in those with
bradycardia; however, this was explained by differences in
mortality according to the use of HR-modifying drugs. Con-
sistent with findings in some prior literature, we did not find
an excess mortality associated with bradycardia in the
sample of individuals not taking HR-modifying drugs. Mor-
tality in individuals taking HR-modifying drugs was 69%
higher in those with an HR of 50 to 59 bpm and 142% higher
in those with an HR of less than 50 bpm compared with an
HR of 60 to 69 bpm. Finally, our results are consistent with
those of prior literature that demonstrates that the incidence
of CVD and mortality are higher with an increasing HR
greater than 80 bpm and with a prior MESA finding of
increased heart failure with higher HR.25
The finding of higher mortality among participants free
of clinical CVD with an HR of less than 50 bpm for partici-
pants taking HR-modifying drugs was somewhat unex-
pected. The mortality in individuals taking HR-modifying
drugs was significantly higher in those with HRs of less than
60 bpm and greater than 80 bpm, consistent with a J-shaped
curve. For those not prescribed HR-modifying drugs, the
curve appears more linear. Although there was increased
mortality in people not taking HR-modifying drugs in those

with higher HRs, these results seem to be attenuated sec-
ondary to adjustment for both CAC and major ECG abnor-
malities. In addition, sensitivity analyses revealed the same
pattern when excluding participants with major ECG abnor-
malities.
The literature relating high RHRs (tachycardia) to CVD and
mortality is compelling. Our results are generally concordant
with those in the current literature in participants not taking
HR-modifying drugs. In contrast, Paul et al17 demonstrated a
linear relationship between RHR and mortality in normoten-
sive patients and those with untreated HTN. Jouven et al9,10
studied approximately 5700 working middle-aged men with-
out known or suspected cardiovascular disease; lower base-
line HR was not associated with an increased mortality risk.
Diaz et al5 assessed the relationship between RHR in patients
with suspected or proven CAD with median follow-up for 14.7
years and found that all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mor-
tality, and cardiovascular rehospitalizations were increased
with increasing HR. In our study, we assessed patients with-
out any known CVD but found similar increased CVD and mor-
tality with higher HR.
There are relatively few studies reporting the association
of low RHR and mortality. Most of the literature discusses HR
change over time.11,17,19,20 Two studies found a relatively lin-
ear relationship between heart rate and mortality. Okin et al11
found a linear relationship between in-treatment HR on serial
ECGs with CVD and mortality. The study11 specifically exam-
ined hypertensive patients with LVH and included individu-

als with DM, CAD, stroke, PVD, atrial fibrillation, and heart
failure. Paul et al17 examined change in HR over time in a
hypertensive cohort without pacemakers or atrial fibrillation.
Survival analysis adjusted for age, sex, BMI, smoking, rate-
limiting therapy, systolic BP, and serum cholesterol level and
concluded that there was little indication of a J-shaped rela-
tionship for final HR or change in HR.
The literature has previously demonstrated J-shaped
relationships between HR and outcomes. Kolloch et al19 spe-
cifically examined BP control and adverse outcomes using
either a verapamil sustained release–based or an atenolol-
based treatment strategy were evaluated in 22 192 patients
with HTN 50 years or older with clinically stable CAD (with-
out pacemakers). First, in this study baseline (pretreatment)
bradycardia was not associated with adverse outcomes after
adjustments; however, follow-up HR showed a J-shaped rela-
tionship more marked in those with previous myocardial
infarction or diabetes mellitus, suggesting that excessive HR
reduction may be harmful. Nauman et al20 conducted a pro-
spective study that examined HR change over time. The
analyses excluded individuals with current use of BP drugs,
history of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, diabetes
mellitus, or stroke. Similar to our results, in their study the
association of change in RHR with ischemic heart disease
mortality was not linear, suggesting that a decrease in RHR
showed no general mortality benefit. Finally, the recent
SIGNIFY trial26 randomizing adults with CAD to ivabradine or
placebo failed to show that lowering the HR (mean HR, 60.7
vs 70.6 bpm) reduced the incidence of CVD overall, and
found a subgroup of participants (those with activity-limiting
angina) for whom ivabradine use was associated with an
increased risk of cardiovascular death and nonfatal myocar-
dial infarction.26
There are some limitations to these findings, including the
potential for confounding by indication because we could not
determine why individuals were taking HR-modifying drugs
at baseline. It is possible that these individuals may have been
using these drugs for arrhythmias, heart failure, or other CVD

not reported to MESA. Perhaps more likely, persons taking
these drugs may have had a previously higher BP and that ad-
justing for a single, baseline BP may not fully account for the
increased risk associated with high BP. Thus, the adverse haz-
ard noted for individuals taking these drugs reflects not the
drug effect or HR, but rather the previously more severe HTN
relative to other participants. The design of MESA precludes
determiningparticipants’HRpriortotreatmentwithdrugsthat
might affect HR. In addition, our subgroup analyses created
smaller sample sizes, and the small number of CVD-related
deaths precluded a separate analysis. However, there are sev-
eral strengths to these analyses as well. MESA is a well-
characterized,sex-balancedandethnicallydiversepopulation-
based sample with multiyear follow-up for events, which were
adjudicated. In contrast with several prior studies, MESA was
a CVD-free population. We were also able to adjust for mul-
tiplepotentialconfoundersandcomorbiditiesaswellasforsub-
clinical atherosclerosis.
Conclusions
Our results may be reassuring to most adults found to have
asymptomatic bradycardia. In contrast, the association of bra-
dycardia with mortality among participants prescribed drugs
that may slow HR may have clinical relevance. Further work
is needed in other cohorts and trial databases to see whether
these findings can be replicated and if confirmed, to deter-
mine whether this association is causally linked to HR or to use
of these agents.
