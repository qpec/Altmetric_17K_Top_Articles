STRUCTURED ABSTRACT
Background—Recent data establishes a strong link between peer video ratings of surgical skill 
and clinical outcomes with laparoscopic gastric bypass. Whether skill for one bariatric procedure 
can predict outcomes for another, related procedure is unknown.
Methods—Twenty surgeons voluntarily submitted videos of a standard laparoscopic gastric 
bypass procedure, which was blindly rated by 10 or more peers using a modified version of the 
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS). Surgeons were divided into 
quartiles for skill in performing gastric bypass and their outcomes within 30 days after sleeve 
gastrectomy were compared. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was utilized to adjust for 
patient risk factors.
Results—Surgeons with skill ratings in the top (n=5), middle (n=10, middle two combined), and 
bottom (n=5) quartiles for laparoscopic gastric bypass had similar rates of surgical and medical 
complications following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (top 5.7%, middle 6.4%, bottom 5.5%, 
p=0.13). Furthermore, surgeon skill ratings did not correlate with rates of reoperation, readmission 
and emergency department visits. Top rated surgeons had significantly faster operating room times 
for sleeve gastrectomy (top 76 min, middle 90 min, bottom 88 min; p<0.001) and a higher annual 
volume of bariatric cases per year (top 240, middle 147, bottom 105; p=0.001).

 Conclusions—Video ratings of surgical skill with laparoscopic gastric bypass do not predict 
outcomes with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Evaluation of surgical skill with one procedure 
may not apply to other related procedures and may require independent assessment of surgical

INTRODUCTION
It is well established that surgical outcomes vary widely across hospitals and surgeons. 
Numerous studies over the past two decades have demonstrated a relationship between 
outcomes and certain proxies for surgeon proficiency, including high surgeon- and hospital-
volume, as well as subspecialty fellowship training.7, 9, 14, 16, 18 Recently, evidence has 
emerged demonstrating that peer-ratings of surgical skill from operative videos are highly 
correlated with better outcomes for laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery.3 This body of work 
has generated significant enthusiasm for using videos to study and improve the intra-
operative details of surgical care via coaching or other methods.4, 8, 12, 17
Given the growing interest for studying surgeon skill as a measure of quality, it is important 
to understand whether these ratings can be extrapolated beyond the measured operation to 
other procedures within that surgeon’s practice. On one hand, many laparoscopic skills such 
as exposure, dissection, and tissue handling are relevant to a wide variety of procedures. On 
the other hand, surgical procedures may have certain technical steps that require procedure-
specific skills. Each operation may require skills that may not be immediately translatable to 
other procedures. For example, when performing laparoscopic gastric bypass, one would 
have to be adept at performing gastrointestinal anastomoses (involving advanced 
laparoscopic stapling and suturing), a skill set which may not be essential for another 
common bariatric procedure, such as laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.
In this context, we sought to assess the extent to which surgical skill ratings with one 
laparoscopic procedure (gastric bypass) correlate with outcomes for another, bariatric 
procedure (sleeve gastrectomy) performed by the same surgeons. Using data from the 
Michigan Bariatric Surgical Collaborative (MBSC), we compared video peer-ratings of 
surgical skill using a modified Objective Structures Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) 
assessment of surgeons performing a laparoscopic gastric bypass with risk-adjusted 
outcomes for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy among the same cohort of surgeons.
METHODS
Data Source and Study Population
This study was conducted based on the analysis of data from the Michigan Bariatric Surgical 
Collaborative (MBSC). The MBSC is a payer-funded consortium of 40 hospitals and 75 
surgeons that submit data on all patients undergoing primary and revisional bariatric surgery. 
Since 2006, data on over 54,000 patients have been obtained and include a wide range of

 variables including information on demographic variables, preoperative comorbidities, 
perioperative process of care, 30-day complication rates and weight loss outcomes. Data 
obtained on patient variables are collected by centrally trained abstractors based on 
standardized definitions and are audited annually by external reviewers from the 
coordinating center to ensure accuracy and completeness of data.
This study included data on patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy 
between August 2006 and March 2015 by 20 surgeons who participated in this study 
(n=7,663). The study cohort was compared to the remaining patients who underwent sleeve 
gastrectomy in the MBSC (n=9,577) in order to assess for patient bias. We found that both 
groups were similar with respect to mean BMI, age and rate of male patients, 30-day 
complications, reoperations, readmissions and emergency room visits. (Appendix 1)
Participating Surgeons and Raters
The objective of this study was to assess the outcomes of surgeons performing laparoscopic 
sleeve gastrectomy based on their peer-reviewed skill ratings of laparoscopic gastric bypass. 
Details of the video submission and rater review process are described in our previous study 
by Birkmeyer et al.3 To summarize, 20 surgeons participated in the study and submitted 
videos of a standard laparoscopic gastric bypass, which was edited to consist of three key 
technical components of the operation: 1) creation of the gastric pouch, 2) the 
gastrojejunostomy and 3) the jejunojejunostomy. Videos were free of patient identifiers and 
were also edited to eliminate images that may reveal the identity of the patient (i.e. camera 
exchanges to clean the lens or to move from one port to another). Each video was rated by 
10 or more peers who were blinded to the identity of the operating surgeon. Overall, 33 
surgeons from 24 hospitals served as raters from July 2011 and June 2012. Surgeons rated 
each video using a modified version of the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical 
Skills (OSATS) ], which has been validated previously.6, 11 The assessment tool includes an 
evaluation of a surgeon’s tissue handling, time and motion, instrument handling, flow of 
operation, tissue exposure and overall technical skill. Surgeons were rated using a 1-to-5 
anchored Likert-type scale. A skill rating of 1 indicated the level of a general surgery chief 
resident; 3 that of an average bariatric surgeon; and 5 that of a “master” surgeon. There was 
no attempt to teach raters or provide rating norms. Since each video was rated by a different 
groups of raters, a z score was calculated and it was determined that no rater’s score was 
significantly different from the mean. A sensitivity analysis was also performed in the prior 
study, which involved rating a video of a second operation from each surgeon in the best and 
worst quartiles of skill. This demonstrated that the mean ratings for the first and second 
videos were highly correlated. Finally, 5 non-Michigan surgeons rated the gastric bypass 
videos of surgeons in the highest and lowest skill quartiles. Mean ratings from Michigan and 
non-Michigan surgeons were also highly correlated and there was no overlap among mean 
ratings of surgeons in the highest and lowest quartiles. 3
Outcomes
The primary goal of this study was to determine whether peer-ratings of surgical skill from a 
video of laparoscopic gastric bypass were associated with risk-adjusted outcomes for 
patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. To assess outcomes, we used the

 following adverse events assessed in the MBSC clinical registry: any postoperative 
complications, reoperation, readmission, and emergency department visits. Postoperative 
complications included surgical-site infection, abdominal abscess, leak, bowel obstruction, 
bleeding, pneumonia, respiratory failure, renal failure, venous thromboembolism, 
myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest and death.
Statistical Analysis
Surgeons were categorized into three groups according to quartiles of skill ratings: the 
bottom group (first quartile), middle group (second and third quartiles), and top group 
(fourth quartile) using methods previously described in our prior study.3 We compared risk-
adjusted rates of complications between the three groups of surgeon skill ratings. We 
performed risk-adjustment using a multivariate logistic regression model with clustering of 
patients treated by surgeons to estimate the expected number of complications for each 
group of surgeon skill ratings. Risk-adjusted complication rates were then calculated as the 
ratio of observed number to the expected number of complications (observed-to-expected 
ratio) for each group of surgeon skill rating multiplied by the overall crude rate of 
complications. This model is adjusted for all patient variables that are measured in the 
MBSC dataset including demographics, preoperative comorbidities, and mobility 
limitations. For other specific risk-adjusted rates of complications, reoperations, 
readmissions and emergency department visits, we used multivariable logistic regression 
with forward stepwise selection using P<0.05 as the inclusion criteria to select other 
covariates. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, 
inc) and STATA, version 12.0 (Statacorp).
RESULTS
Surgeons Skill Ratings
Summary ratings of surgical skill for gastric bypass varied substantially among surgeons in 
the study (range 2.9 – 4.4). (Table 1). Surgeons in the quartile with the highest skill rating 
also performed a significantly higher annual volume of bariatric procedures than those in the 
lowest quartile (240 vs 105 cases, p=0.01). The difference between the mean annual volume 
of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was also higher (96 vs 33 cases) and trended towards 
statistical significance. Surgeons with higher skill ratings also had significantly faster mean 
operating times for both laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (76 min. vs. 88 min., p<0.001) and 
any bariatric procedure (84 min. vs. 113 min., p<0.001) when compared to the lowest skill 
quartile.
Patient Characteristics
A total of 7,663 patients underwent sleeve gastrectomy by surgeons who participated in this 
study. Overall, the mean BMI was 48.3 kg/m2, mean age was 46.1 years and 24.2% of 
patients were male. There were small but statistically significant differences between certain 
patient demographics and comorbidities in each quartile, and these were fully accounted for 
in our risk-adjustment models. (Table 2)

 Outcomes after Sleeve Gastrectomy
Risk-adjusted rates of complications after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for surgeons with 
different skill ratings are presented in Table 3. There were no significant differences in 30-
day complications rates (surgical or medical) among patients in each quartile. (Figure 1) 
Surgeons with skill ratings in the top (n=5), middle (n=10, middle two combined), and 
bottom (n=5) quartiles for laparoscopic gastric bypass had similar overall complication rates 
following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (top 5.7%, middle 6.4%, bottom 5.5%, p=0.13). 
Mortality was low, with no deaths in the bottom quartile and 0.09% mortality rate in the top 
quartile (p=0.91). Likewise, the rate of leak or perforation among the three groups was low 
and not significantly different across groups (top rated surgeons, 0.85%, middle 0.39%, 
bottom 0.54%, p=0.85).
Similarly, there was no relationship found between surgeon skill ratings with gastric bypass 
and measures of resource utilization after sleeve gastrectomy (Figure 2). Rates of 
reoperation were low for surgeons of all skill levels and were the same for both the top and 
bottom quartiles (1.1%). Emergency department visit were also not significantly different 
across skill levels: top rated surgeons (7.0%), middle (9.1%) and bottom (6.0%) (p=0.73). 
The rates of hospital readmission were also not significantly different across skill levels: top 
rated surgeons (3.8%), middle (4.8%), and bottom (3.1%), p=0.64.
DISCUSSION
This study evaluates whether peer video ratings of surgical skill for one procedure are 
correlated with outcomes for another common bariatric operation performed by the same 
surgeons. We found no relationship between surgeon’s skill ratings for laparoscopic gastric 
bypass and risk-adjusted outcomes for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. This finding was 
consistent across several short-term outcomes including complications, reoperations, and 
readmissions. These findings suggest that peer ratings of surgical skill with one procedure 
may not translate to other related operations, even those in the same specialty performed by 
the same surgeons.
In a prior study, we evaluated the relationship between surgical skill and risk-adjusted 
outcomes for laparoscopic gastric bypass. Using surgeon videos from the Michigan Bariatric 
Surgery Collaborative (MBSC), we found a very strong step-wise relationship between 
ratings on the modified OSATS instrument and several important outcomes, including 
overall complications, serious complications, readmissions, and reoperations. 3 Although 
numerous studies evaluate the relationship between proxies of surgical skill, such as 
surgeon- and hospital- volume and fellowship training, data from this prior study was the 
first to link peer video ratings of surgeon skill to patient outcomes directly.
The present study builds on this work and establishes whether surgical skill ratings assessed 
with one operation are related to outcomes with other related procedures in that surgeon’s 
practice. Despite comparing two laparoscopic bariatric operations (ostensibly similar 
procedures) performed by the same surgeons, we found that skill ratings with laparoscopic 
gastric bypass were not correlated with short-term outcomes for laparoscopic sleeve 
gastrectomy. This implies that peer ratings of surgical skill are procedure-specific and that

 programs aimed at assessing and improving surgeon skill for bariatric surgery, and perhaps 
other complex operations, will need separate evaluations for each type of procedure.
The lack of a relationship between skill with laparoscopic gastric bypass and outcomes with 
sleeve gastrectomy could be explained in multiple ways. The first explanation is that surgical 
skill is not generalizable from one operation to another. In other words, optimal outcomes 
for an operation may depend on procedure-specific skills. For example, optimal outcomes 
after laparoscopic gastric bypass may be dependent on the skills necessary to perform the 
gastrojejunostomy or jejuno-jejunostomy (i.e. a gastrointestinal anastomoses), whereas 
outcomes after sleeve gastrectomy may be dependent on safe and adequate mobilization of 
the stomach. Although both tasks require some level of skill, they are different types of skill 
sets (sewing vs. dissecting) that may not translate from one procedure to another.
A second alternative explanation is that surgical skill is not as important for outcomes after 
laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy as it is for laparoscopic gastric bypass. Since laparoscopic 
sleeve gastrectomy does not require the surgeon to perform laparoscopic gastrointestinal 
anastomoses, it may be considered a technically simpler operation that may not be as 
dependent on advanced skills as with gastric bypass and thus errors may be less likely to 
manifest into a complication within 30 days of surgery. Instead, it is possible that surgical 
skill for sleeve gastrectomy has a greater affect on long-term outcomes, such as weight loss 
or development of reflux at one year. Which of these hypotheses explains our findings is not 
clear and deserves further study.
It is also worth noting that our evaluation of surgical proficiency in this study does not take 
into account variations in surgical technique. This is an important distinction to make, as 
operative technique and surgical skill are different constructs and can both impact the 
ultimate outcome of an operation.2 While technique involves the specific steps and sequence 
of events during a procedure (how an operation is done), skill is a measure of a surgeon’s 
ability to execute these steps (how well an operation is done). It is plausible that a surgeon 
may perform an inferior operation (from a technique perspective) and yet appear to be 
highly skilled during video evaluation. For instance, a surgeon performing a sleeve 
gastrectomy may handle tissue and divide the stomach in a skillful manner but may also fail 
to perform important steps of the operation (e.g., mobilize the fundus adequately or repair a 
hiatal hernia when present). Further study evaluating the interaction of surgical skill and 
technique are necessary to tease out the independent contribution of each.
There are several imitations to our study that should be considered. First, the participation of 
surgeons was voluntary and may have introduced a selection bias both at the patient and 
surgeon level. Despite this, patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy had similar 
demographics and mean perioperative outcomes when compared to the broader group of 
patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy in the MBSC. This also means that self-selected 
surgeons in this study were not over- or under-performing when compared to the remaining 
surgeons in the collaborative. With regard to rating of surgical videos, we did not measure 
the influence by other members of the surgical team such as assistants, residents, and other 
surgical staff associated with the procedure being reviewed. A surgeon’s skill may be limited 
or enhanced depending on their assistant’s skill.10 Nonetheless, the performance of the team

 was also not measured for our prior study on laparoscopic gastric bypass, which did show a 
positive association between surgeon skill and outcomes. Another limitation is that this 
study does not take into account a surgeon’s learning curve or the evolution of their 
technique. Previous studies demonstrate a substantial learning curve before mastering 
laparoscopic gastric bypass. 1, 5, 13 It is unclear whether the same learning curve exists for 
laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Between 2006 and 2013 there was rapid rise in the number 
of sleeve gastrectomy procedures in the state of Michigan.15 During the time of this study, 
surgeons may have been at different points on their learning curve with regards to 
laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. To account for the effect of year of surgery on 
complication rates, we controlled for year of surgery in our final risk-adjusted model. 
However, our data also demonstrates that surgeons with higher skill ratings for gastric 
bypass were performing a higher volume of bariatric cases overall and had faster mean 
operative times for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Although this may indicate that these 
surgeons had overcome their learning curve for sleeve gastrectomy, it appears as though it 
had no effect on complication rates.
This study has implications for efforts aimed at improving performance and quality with 
bariatric surgery. The most direct implications are for a recently initiated surgical coaching 
program in the MBSC. We are implementing a video-based coaching trial sponsored by the 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) that will begin in October of 2015. This program was 
originally aimed at improving technical skill with laparoscopic gastric bypass. However, 
with the rapid rise in the use of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and the decline in the use of 
laparoscopic gastric bypass, we have amended our protocol to include coaching for both 
procedures. We conducted the present analysis to inform our selection of surgical coaches, 
which was intended to be based on video skill ratings. This study was critical for informing 
our coach selection process. Because skill with gastric bypass did not correlate with sleeve 
gastrectomy, we could not use our existing skill video ratings to select laparoscopic sleeve 
gastrectomy coaches. We thereore selected our sleeve gastrectomy coaches based on their 
risk-adjusted outcomes with that procedure.
This study has broader implications for other efforts aimed at improving quality using 
surgical skill ratings. With the prevalent use of minimally invasive techniques that use video, 
there is significant potential for utilizing video-based skill ratings for assessing competency 
in surgery and also improving quality. The findings of our study suggest that a surgeon’s 
skill with one operation may not translate into other similar operations. Thus, skill 
assessments should focus on individual procedures given the variation in technique, 
necessary skill sets, learning curves and even instrumentation in some cases. Our study 
emphasizes the utility of video-based skill assessment for competency when new procedures 
or innovative devices are introduced into mainstream surgical practices. Instead of relying on 
day-long or weekend courses that fail to address differences in surgeons’ level of skill, 
experience or specific learning style, a video-based approach has the ability to identify 
unique learning gaps and thus offer a personalized approach to improving skill.

 CONCLUSIONS
Video-based peer ratings of surgical skill with laparoscopic gastric bypass did not correlate 
with outcomes for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Surgeons with higher skill ratings for 
gastric bypass had similar outcomes to surgeons with lower skill ratings when evaluating 30-
day complication rates with sleeve gastrectomy. These findings suggest that video-based 
rating of skill with one operation does not predict outcomes of another similar operation. In 
order to evaluate the impact of surgical skill on outcomes, each procedure requires an 
independent evaluation of surgical technical proficiency.
