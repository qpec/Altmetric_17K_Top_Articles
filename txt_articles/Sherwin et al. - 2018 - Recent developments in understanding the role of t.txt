There is a growing appreciation of the role of the gut microbiota in all aspects of health and disease, including
brain health. Indeed, roles for the bacterial commensals in various psychiatric and neurological conditions, such
as depression, autism, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease, are emerging. Microbiota dysregulation
has been documented in all of these conditions or in animal models thereof. Moreover, depletion or modulation
of the gut microbiota can affect the severity of the central pathology or behavioral deficits observed in a variety of
brain disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying such effects are only slowly being unraveled. Additionally,
recent preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that targeting the microbiota through prebiotic, probiotic, or dietary
interventions may be an effective “psychobiotic” strategy for treating symptoms in mood, neurodevelopmental
disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases.

Introduction
Advances in sequencing and metabolomics tech-
nologies have enabled scientists to explore the
full extent of how microbes affect every aspect
of the world we live in. Indeed, almost all areas
of medicine have been shown to be affected by
the trillions of bacteria that reside within the gut,
including neurology and psychiatry. However, it is
easily forgotten that the concept of microorganisms
conferring host health benefits has existed for some
time. It is now over 100 years since the Nobel laure-
ate Elie Metchnikoff of the Pasteur Institute in Paris
proposed that lactic acid bacteria may play a key role
in the programming of the aging process.1 Hubert
J. Norman, working at the Camberwell House
asylum, and George Porter Phillips, working in the
Bethlem Royal Hospital, both in London, tested
the concept that lactic acid bacteria may amelio-
rate the symptoms of depression.2,3 Since then,
considerable advances have been made in under-
standing how the bacterial commensals within our
gastrointestinal system can influence host health.
Over the past decade, it has become clear that
the bidirectional communication pathway between
gut bacteria and the central nervous system
(CNS), the microbiota–gut–brain axis, exerts a
profound influence on key brain processes, such
as neuroinflammation, activation of the stress axes,
neurotransmission, and neurogenesis, in addition
to modulating complex behaviors, such as socia-
bility and anxiety.4–13 Gut bacteria influence these
central processes through their ability to synthesize
neurotransmitters
(i.e.,
�-amino
butyric
acid
(GABA), noradrenaline, and dopamine) and mod-
ulate activation of the immune system, along with
their ability to produce metabolites, such as short-
chain fatty acids (SCFAs), that possess neuroactive
properties.4 Moreover, the gut microbiota and the
brain are linked through additional pathways, such
as the vagus pathway, and through the modulation
of key dietary amino acids, such as tryptophan14–17
(Fig. 1). Given the close association between the gut
microbiota and the brain, it is not all that surprising
that gut bacteria have roles to play in neurological
and psychiatric diseases. Evidence now suggests that

 The gut microbiota in brain health and disease
Sherwin et al.
Figure 1. Key mechanisms underlying communication between the gut microbiota and the brain. Gut bacteria can signal to
the brain through a variety of mechanisms. These include the production of SCFA metabolites, modulation of immune signaling
to the brain, and transmission via the vagus nerve. These mechanisms serve to influence central homeostatic processes, such
as neurotransmission, neurogenesis, and neuroinflammation, all of which are involved in several neurological and psychiatric
conditions. SCFAs, short-chain fatty acids; BBB, blood–brain barrier; HPA, hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis; CNS, central

the bacterial commensals of the gut can influence
conditions
such
as
depression,
schizophrenia,
and autism.5,15,18–20 While great strides have been
taken in elucidating how bacterial commensals
may be involved in these conditions, more insight
is required before microbiota-based therapies
can be rationally employed as viable treatment
options. Perhaps what is surprising, however,
is the extent to which gut bacteria appear to
be involved in other facets of brain health and
behavior. Emerging research now suggests that
the microbiota–gut–brain axis is also involved in
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s
disease and Parkinson’s disease, and psychiatric
conditions, such as addiction.
Microbiota and neurology: aging
and neurodegeneration
With an increase in the age that humans are living
there is a need to better understand the biologi-
cal mechanisms underpinning the aging process. In
light of this, it is important to elucidate how aging
affects the microbiota–gut–brain axis, as it may pro-
vide us with a greater insight into age-related dis-
eases, such as stroke and neurodegenerative diseases
(i.e., Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease).
Aging
Advances in modern medicine have led to an
increase in human longevity. While humans are liv-
ing longer, the onus is now on medical and scientific
research to mitigate the severity of age-related dis-
eases (i.e., cognitive decline, stroke, gastrointestinal
disturbances, cancer, etc.). Although there is a
growing body of evidence as to how bacterial com-
mensals are affected with age,21–23 there is limited
information to date about how such changes may
affect the microbiota–gut–brain axis. However, this
deficit is beginning to be addressed.24 For instance,
we have recently characterized the microbiota com-
position of aged (20–21 months old) versus young
(2–3 months old) mice.25 Aged animals displayed an
altered microbiota, with changes observed in phyla
thathavepreviouslybeenassociatedwithinflamma-
tion, which is consistent with previous reports.25,26
Aged animals display increased basal intestinal
permeability, which is exacerbated in response to
stress. Such increases in intestinal permeability are
likely to increase the risk for the translocation of
bacteria or bacterial components (i.e., lipopolysac-
charide (LPS)) from the gut lumen into the
circulation, where they can elicit an inflammatory
response. Indeed, aged mice display an increase

 Sherwin et al.
The gut microbiota in brain health and disease
in several circulating inflammatory cytokines (i.e.,
interleukin (IL)-1�, IL-4, IL-2, and tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-�) compared with young mice.25
Other studies assessing the effect of age on
the murine microbiota have reported conflicting
results. For instance, Conley et al. reported no dif-
ferences in the relative ratio of Firmicutes to Bac-
teroidetes in aged mice (26 months old), with an
increase in the Muscipirillum genus their most sig-
nificant outcome.27 However, a separate study by
Kim et al. identified an increase in the level of
Firmicutes and Actinobacteria with a correspond-
ing decrease in Bacteroidetes in aged animals (18
months).28 However, these differences may be due
to the fact that aged female C57 mice were used in
the study by Conley et al., while Kim et al. used
aged male C57 mice.27,28 Although these studies
report different alterations to the microbiota with
respecttoage,botharguethatthealteredmicrobiota
may be driving the observed elevated inflammatory
response in aged animals.27,28 The elevated circulat-
ing inflammatory profile of aged animals may help
to explain the cognitive behavioral deficits reported
in these animals.25
While the microbiota appears to be affected
by aging, evidence suggests that targeting the gut
commensals provides an opportunity to mitigate
age-associated inflammation and other deleterious
conditions associated with age. For instance,
treatment of aged mice (18 months old) with the
Lactobacillus brevis OW38 strain was found to
improve the expression of intestinal tight junction
proteins, along with reducing the Firmicutes to Bac-
teroidetes ratio.29 Moreover, this Lactobacillus strain
attenuated circulating levels of inflammatory mark-
ers (IL-1� and TNF-�) while also increasing the
expression of the neurotrophin brain-derived neu-
rotrophic factor in the hippocampus.29 Polyphenols
have also demonstrated efficacy in attenuating
age-associated inflammation and dysregulation to
the gut microbiota of mice. Treatment of middle-
aged mice (40 weeks old) with the polyphenolic
lignan syringaresinol reduced circulating levels of
the proinflammatory marker LPS binding protein
(LBP), while also increasing the humoral response
to vaccination with the influenza virus.30 Moreover,
syringaresinol modulated the gut microbiota by
increasing the relative abundance of Lactobacillus
and Bifidobacterium species, while decreasing levels
of the potentially harmful Akkermansia genus.30
While these are promising preclinical studies, such
modulators of the microbiota will need to be
assessed in humans in order to determine whether
they display efficacy in mitigating the deleterious
effects of aging in humans. Nonetheless, these are
promising findings that suggest that targeting the
microbiota may help to prolong human longevity
and attenuate age-related inflammation.
Parkinson’s disease
Parkinson’s disease is characterized pathologically
bydegenerationoftheparscompactaofthesubstan-
tia nigra of the mid brain and widespread neuroin-
flammation. Neurologically, parkinsonian patients
exhibit a range of motor-related impairments,
such as bradykinesia, resting tremors, muscular
rigidity, and impairments in posture. Before the
development of the motor symptoms, parkinsonian
patients often report prodromal nonmotor-related
symptoms, such as depression, sleep disturbances,
and constipation, suggestive of gastrointestinal
dysfunction.31,32 Moreover, gastrointestinal func-
tion is further exacerbated following progression
of the disease with constipation, impaired gastric
emptying, and difficulties with defecation all
reported in patients.32 Furthermore, �-synuclein,
the protein aggregate hallmark of Parkinson’s dis-
ease pathology in the brain, has also been identified
in the mucosal and submucosal nerve fibers and
ganglia of the enteric nervous systems (ENSs)33,34
of parkinsonian patients, with some preclinical
evidence even suggesting that �-synuclein in the
gut can transport to the brain via the vagus nerve.35
Given the gastrointestinal disturbances reported
in Parkinson’s disease, it stands to reason that
the microbiota–gut–brain axis is affected in this
neurodegenerative disease. Indeed, Scheperjans
et al. identified a reduced abundance of the
Prevotella species in fecal samples from parkin-
sonian patients.36 A more recent clinical study
also identified a reduction in the abundance of
Prevotella species (P. copri) in the microbiota of
parkinsonian patients, along with increases in
Akkermansia muciniphilia.37 Given that Prevotella
species produce mucin, which serves to enhance
the integrity of the intestinal barrier, a reduced
abundance of this bacteria strain may lead to
increases in intestinal permeability in parkinsonian
patients and subsequent bacterial translocation.36
In a separate study, the fecal microbiota of

 The gut microbiota in brain health and disease
Sherwin et al.
parkinsonian patients were found to contain lower
levels of anti-inflammatory–associated bacteria
from the genera Blautia and Roseburia and a higher
level of proinflammatory-associated bacteria from
the genus Faecalibacterium when compared with
healthy controls.38 Recent work by Hill-Burns et al.
also identified alterations to the gut microbiota
in parkinsonian patients; however, the changes
reported were different from those in previous
reports.39 Although these studies report different
alterations to the gut microbiota of parkinsonian
patients, they collectively suggest that there is
dysregulation to the gut commensals that may
facilitate inflammation and bacterial translocation.
Further corroborating a dysregulated microbiota–
gut–brain axis in Parkinson’s disease was a recent
observation by Unger et al., who demonstrated
that the levels of SCFAs—the microbial metabolites
acetate, butyrate, and propionate—were all signif-
icantly lower in parkinsonian patients relative to
age-matched healthy controls.40 Given that SCFAs
are able to cross into the brain and possess neu-
roactive properties, such as regulating microglial
activation,41 a reduction in their production in
Parkinson’s disease may affect disease pathology.
Other reports of microbiota dysregulation in
Parkinson’s disease include small intestine bacterial
overgrowth or high prevalence rates of colonization
with the Gram-negative bacterium Helicobacter
pylori.42,43 Parkinsonian patients are found to
have increased urinary indoxyl sulfate levels,
which is indicative of overgrowth of bacteria in
the small intestine or constipation.44 H. pylori
infection may contribute to the development of
parkinsonian
symptoms
through
degenerating
dopaminergic neurons in the brain.45 Interest-
ingly, eradication of H. pylori has been shown
to enhance the onset time of levodopa (first-line
pharmacological treatment for Parkinson’s dis-
ease symptoms) while also improving tremor,
rigidity, and walking ability.43,46 Metagenomic
analysis has revealed that genes involved in the
biosynthesis of LPS are upregulated in parkin-
sonian patients, suggesting that a dysregulated
microbiota is potentially driving aberrant immune
activation in the neurodegenerative disease.38
Animal models of Parkinson’s disease have pro-
vided considerable insight into the pathology of
the neurodegenerative disease. Recent intriguing
work has identified a potential mechanism for how
the microbiota–gut–brain axis may be involved in
the neurodegenerative disease. In the absence of
a microbiota, �-synuclein–overexpressing mice do
not show as great an impairment in motor and gas-
trointestinal symptoms when compared with con-
ventionally colonized mice of the same genotype.47
Microglia in the striatum of germ-free (mice com-
pletely devoid of a microbiota; see Fig. 2 for a sum-
mary of the neurobiological changes observed in
germ-free mice), �-synuclein–overexpressing mice
displayed a less activated phenotype relative to con-
ventional colonized mice of the same genotype, sug-
gesting a less reactive phenotype in the absence of
a microbiota, which is consistent with reports from
previous studies in germ-free mice.47,48 Moreover,
administrationofSCFAs(acetate,butyrate,andpro-
pionate) to germ-free, �-synuclein–overexpressing
mice exacerbated motor deficits to a level compara-
ble to conventionally colonized mice of the same
genotype, suggesting that SCFAs are the facilita-
tors of the adverse effect that the microbiota has
on motor symptoms.47 It is worth noting, however,
that the concentration of SCFAs administered to
mice in this study were considerably higher than
what would expected to normally be found in vivo.
While the data are compelling in suggesting that
SCFAs are the mediators of motor dysfunction in
these experiments, more work is required to deter-
mine whether elevated levels of endogenous SCFAs
are driving these behavioral changes. Moreover, the
authors demonstrate that microbiota derived from
parkinsonianpatientsexacerbatedmotorsymptoms
of �-synuclein–overexpressing mice compared with
thosemicewhoreceivedamicrobiotafromahealthy
human, suggesting that dysregulation of the micro-
biota can worsen motor symptoms when combined
with a genetic predisposition.47 Given these obser-
vations, targeting the microbiota–gut–brain axis
may help alleviate some of the neurological and gas-
trointestinal symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form
of age-related dementia worldwide. The neu-
rodegenerative disease is characterized by the
accumulation of amyloid plaques, tau fibrils, and
widespread neuroinflammation that culminates in
severe cognitive impairments, such as long-term
memory loss, and other symptoms, such as physical
disability and exhaustion. Given the neurological

The gut microbiota in brain health and disease

and fail to respond to bacterial-associated molecular patterns (i.e., LPS) as efficiently as specific pathogen-free or conventional
mice. These mice also display increases in the permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), which corresponds to a reduction in
the expression of tight junction proteins. Reduction in the integrity of the BBB may allow for the translocation of immune cells
and bacterial components into the brain of germ-free mice. Germ-free mice also exhibit increased neurogenesis, which corresponds
to an increase in the volume of the hippocampus of these animals in comparison with specific pathogen-free or conventional
animals. Finally, germ-free mice display several unique alterations to neuronal homeostasis. For instance, these animals exhibit
hypermyelination of the frontal cortex along with increases in serotonin turnover in the hippocampus. Moreover, there is an increase
in markers of synaptic and neuronal plasticity in these animals, which may correspond to the increases in neurogenesis and brain
volume observed in these animals. For a comprehensive review on germ-free mice, see Ref. 122. LPS, lipopolysaccharide.
nature of this disease, perhaps it is surprising that
emerging evidence suggests that the microbiota–
gut–brain axis may have a role to play in this
condition. Recently, Cattaneo et al. identified that
the Escherichia/Shigella bacterial genera, which
are associated with mediating inflammation, were
increased in fecal samples from Alzheimer’s patients
relative to control subjects. Moreover, the increase
in these bacterial taxa positively correlated with an
increase in the expression of the proinflammatory
cytokines IL-1� and CXCL2 in whole blood.49 Such
results suggest a causal link between dysregulation
of the microbiota and systemic inflammation,
which may initiate or exacerbate the neurodegen-
eration that is occurring in the brain in Alzheimer’s
disease. Given that intestinal permeability increases
with age,25 bacteria or bacterial components (i.e.,
LPS) may translocate from the lumen of the gut
and mediate systemic and neuroinflammation. In
support of this, levels of LPS and the Escherichia coli
K99 pilli protein have been found to be higher in the
brain parenchyma and blood vessels of Alzheimer’s
patients.50 Moreover, LPS was found to colocalize
with A�1–40 in amyloid plaques, suggesting that
bacterial components do indeed translocate from
the gut into the systemic circulation and reach the
brain in Alzheimer’s disease.50 The microbiota may
influence neurodegeneration in conditions like
Alzheimer’s disease through molecular mimicry.
Dendritic cells in the intestine may sense and
transport bacterial amyloid antigens to immune
cells in Peyer’s patches. For instance, the bacterial
extracellular amyloid protein curli is sensed by the
A11 A� oligomer antibody, which suggests that
there are configurations of amyloid proteins that
have the same structure as microbial proteins.51
Preclinical data have provided a greater insight
intotherolethatthemicrobiota–gut–brainaxismay
play in Alzheimer’s disease. In a recent study, both
young and old germ-free mice overexpressing amy-
loid precursor protein and presenilin 1 (APP/PS1)
were found to display reduced levels of A�42

compared with conventional APP/PS1 mice, along
with a reduction in microglial activation.52 Addi-
tionally, these germ-free APP/PS1 mice displayed
increased levels of A�-degrading enzymes, insulin-
degrading
enzyme,
and
neprilysin-degrading
enzyme, suggesting that, in the absence of a micro-
biota, the murine brain is better equipped to tar-
get the amyloid pathology.52 Moreover, in a sepa-
rate study, chronic treatment of APP/PS1 transgenic
mice with an antibiotic cocktail reduced microglial
and astrocyte accumulation surrounding amyloid
plaques in the hippocampus.53 This observation is
not all that surprising, given that the microbiota can
influence glial cell activation and neuroinflamma-
tion in the brain.48 Interestingly, however, antibi-
otic treatment was found to decrease insoluble A�
plaques while leading to a corresponding increase
in the concentration of soluble A� levels, which
suggests that the gut microbiota has some bear-
ing on amyloid load in the brain.53 Other ani-
mal models of Alzheimer’s disease have also doc-
umented alterations to the microbiota–gut–brain
axis. In the 5xFAD transgenic model of Alzheimer’s
disease (which rapidly develops amyloid plaques),
levels of human A� precursor protein are elevated
not only in the brains of these mice compared with
wild type but also in the gastrointestinal system
(cecum, colon, jejunum, etc.).54 Moreover, these
5xFAD mice displayed an altered microbiota relative
to wild-type controls; with an increase observed in
the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. Within the Fir-
micutes phylum, levels of the Clostridium leptum
species, which are associated with inflammation,
were found to be transiently increased in 5xFAD
mice.54 While these preclinical studies suggest that
the microbiota–gut–brain axis may be involved in
Alzheimer’s disease, more work is required to deter-
mine whether alterations to the bacterial commen-
sals are facilitating the disease or whether a dysreg-
ulated microbiota is a consequence of the central
neurodegeneration.
While little is currently known regarding the role
of the microbiota–gut–brain axis in Alzheimer’s
disease, preliminary preclinical evidence indicates
that diet or modulators of the microbiota (i.e.,
probiotics) may provide a means to ameliorate the
neurodegenerative disease. For instance, grape seed
polyphenol extracts 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and
3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid were shown to
prevent the assembly of A�1–42 into toxic fibrils in
vitro, suggesting that a polyphenol-rich diet may
attenuate amyloid accumulation in the brain.55
The probiotic mixture VSL#3 (combination of
Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium breve,
B. longum, B. infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus,
L. plantarum, L. paracasei, and L. delbrueckii sub-
species Bulgaricus) attenuated age-related deficits
in long-term potentiation, suggesting an improve-
ment in memory, in rats while also ameliorating
age-related microglial activation.56 Despite these
interesting preliminary preclinical studies, more
studies are required with both aged and transgenic
animalstodeterminewhetherdietorprobioticsmay
be employed into the clinical setting as a preventa-
tive measure for the onset of Alzheimer’s disease.
Multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune neurodegener-
ative disease caused by the progressive loss of myelin
sheaths surrounding the axons of neurons. The
degenerative disease is characterized by a variety of
neurological symptoms, such as vision impairment,
ataxia, muscle spasms, paralysis in severe cases, and
fatigue. Moreover, bladder- and gastrointestinal-
related symptoms have also been reported in multi-
ple sclerosis. For instance, Buscarinu et al. recently
demonstrated that there is an increase in intestinal
permeability along with a reduction in intestinal
absorption in patients with the relapsing/remitting
form of the condition.57 A separate clinical study
identified an increase in circulating LBP in patients
with relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis, poten-
tially indicating an increase in the translocation of
Gram-negative bacteria from the intestinal lumen
to the circulation.58 In addition to alterations in
gastrointestinal physiology, there are reports of dys-
regulation to the composition of the gut microbiota
in patients with the condition. Relapsing/remitting
multiple sclerosis patients displayed high interindi-
vidual variability compared with healthy patients,
while there were no significant differences reported
in terms of species richness.59 At the genus level,
the gut microbiota of patients with multiple
sclerosis displayed significant reductions in Fae-
calibacterium, Prevotella, and Anaerostiples.59 More
clinicaldataarerequiredtodeterminewhetherthese
alterations to the gut microbiota and the gastroin-
testinal system in multiple sclerosis are driving
the pathology or if these alterations are simply a
comorbid consequence of the disease.

 Sherwin et al.
The gut microbiota in brain health and disease
Preclinical studies have provided a greater insight
into how the microbiota–gut–brain axis is affected
in multiple sclerosis and whether it contributes
to the observed pathology. For instance, recent
work from our group has demonstrated that the
gut microbiota influences myelination within the
prefrontal cortex of mice.60 Germ-free mice dis-
played increased expression of myelin-related genes
(i.e., Mag, Mbp, Mog, and Mobp) in the prefrontal
cortex relative to conventional mice, which was
restored to control levels following recolonization
with microbiota.60 Antibiotic administration also
increased the expression of myelin-related genes in
the prefrontal cortex of nonobese diabetic mice,
which further corroborates that the gut microbiota
influences myelination within the CNS.61 Interest-
ingly, germ-free mice display significantly attenu-
ated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE; animal model of multiple sclerosis) scores
relative to conventional controls.62 Kyung et al.
demonstrated that the reduced EAE severity in
germ-free mice was due to a reduced ability of den-
dritic cells in these animals to activate proinflam-
matory T cells.62 Consequently, in the absence of
a microbiota, activation of proinflammatory TH17
cells, which drive neurological damage in multi-
ple sclerosis, is blunted. Interestingly, when germ-
free mice were colonized with segmented filament
bacteria, EAE deficits were restored in these ani-
mals, further corroborating that the microbiota
modulates the proinflammatory status of the brain
during EAE. In a separate study, Miller et al.
demonstrated that TNF receptor signaling plays
a role in the cross talk between the host micro-
biota and the immune system during multiple scle-
rosis. Inhibition of TNFR2 signaling exacerbated
multiple sclerosis pathology in myelin oligoden-
drocyte glycoprotein-specific 2D2 T cell receptor
(TCR) mice.63 However, antibiotic administration
attenuated disease severity and mortality in these
mice.63 These findings are likely to have an impor-
tantbearingonanti-TNFtherapiesformultiplescle-
rosis in patients. Interestingly, the composition of
the gut microbiota may determine the severity of
multiple sclerosis. Rats subjected to EAE were more
resistant toward developing multiple sclerosis–like
symptoms if they contained a higher diversity of
Lactobacillus spp. relative to those rats that had a
lower diversity of the lactic acid bacteria.64 Such
results suggest that targeting the microbiota using
beneficial Lactobacillus strains could be used as a
preventative strategy for multiple sclerosis.
Stroke and brain injury
To date, only a few studies have investigated how
the gut microbiota may be involved in stroke and
ischemic brain damage. Clinical data are limited
at the moment, but some studies have identified
dysregulation to the microbiota in patients follow-
ing stroke.65 Alterations to the human microbiota
following stroke have been observed, with specific
decreases observed in the Bacteroides fragilis group
and increases in an Atopobium cluster noted.66
Moreover, microbial metabolism was affected by
stroke, with decreases in fecal concentration of
acetic acid and increases in valeric acid and isova-
leric acid.66 Preclinical data have provided us with a
greater insight into how the microbiota–gut–brain
axis may be affected in stroke and brain injury. For
instance, depletion of gut bacteria through antibi-
otic administration worsened the survival rate of
mice following the induction of ischemia.67 In the
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) preclin-
ical model of stroke, cerebral ischemia is associated
with a dysregulation of the murine microbiota,
with a reduction in bacterial �-diversity, along with
reductions in intestinal motility and intestinal bar-
rier dysfunction observed as an increase in intestinal
permeability.68,69
Microbial-derived
metabolites
may also influence stroke susceptibility through
modulating platelet activation and thrombosis. For
instance, elevated levels of the microbial metabolite
trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO; produced from
the microbial metabolism of TMA-rich foods)
were shown to correlate with an increased risk for
thrombosis in cardiovascular patients.70 TMAO
promoted platelet aggregation in the presence of
thrombin through enhancing intracellular calcium
release.70 Interestingly, while dietary choline or
TMA increased TMAO production and thrombosis
in conventional mice, this effect was not observed
in germ-free mice, indicating that the microbiota
facilitates the production of TMAO through the
metabolism of choline-rich foods. Bacteria within
the Allobaculum taxa (associated with choline
metabolism) were positively correlated with throm-
bosis, indicating that these bacteria may drive
TMAO production.70 Wang et al. demonstrated
that inhibiting microbial TMA lyases with the
choline analogue 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol reduced

Sherwin et al.
in vivo levels of TMAO while also reducing
atherosclerosis, which suggests that the microbiota
may present a therapeutic target for the treatment
of cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke.71
There is considerable evidence to suggest that the
gut microbiota modulates immune signaling dur-
ing stroke to influence the pathological outcome.
Transplantation of a dysregulated poststroke micro-
biota into germ-free mice exacerbated the subse-
quent cerebral damage mediated by MCAO in these
animals, which was associated with increased traf-
ficking of proinflammatory T lymphocytes (TH1
and TH17 phenotype) of intestinal origin to the
cerebral infarct site.68 Further evidence for a role
of intestinal IL-17 in mediating ischemic damage
comes from comprehensive experiments performed
by Benakis et al. The authors eloquently demon-
strated that dysregulation of the murine micro-
biota following antibiotic treatment resulted in a
reduction in the trafficking of the proinflamma-
tory IL-17+ �� T cells, which was associated with a
reduction in IL-17–associated chemokine expres-
sion in brain parenchyma, along with reduced
neutrophil accumulation and a reduction in infarct
volume of the ischemic site.72 Thus, the gut micro-
biota appears to influence the magnitude of post-
stroke neuroinflammation by modulating intestinal
T cell trafficking to the meninges. A recent study
by Sadler et al. highlighted that mice of the same
strain (C57BL/6) but provided from different ven-
dors harbor distinct microbiotas, which influences
the neuroinflammatory response following experi-
mental stroke.73 Notably, the absence of segmented
filamented bacteria in C57 mice from one ven-
dor resulted in a reduced ability to produce anti-
inflammatory Treg cells following stroke.73 Such
results suggest that the use of mice from different
vendors introduces a potential confound of differ-
ing microbiotas, even if they are the same strain of
animal.
Increased activation of the sympathetic nervous
system may also influence dysregulation to the
microbiota following stroke or traumatic brain
injury. MCAO or traumatic brain injury in mice
resulted in a dysregulation to the microbiota,
observed as a decrease in the relative abundance
of Prevotellaceae and Peptococcaceae, which corre-
lated with an increase in noradrenaline release and
noradrenergic innervation of the cecum.74 Nora-
drenaline has been shown to inhibit the expression
of certain species of Prevotella in vitro.75 Increased
activation of the sympathetic nervous system fol-
lowing stroke or traumatic brain injury may lead
to increased noradrenergic innervation of the gas-
trointestinal system that may help to account for
the observed dysregulation to the microbiota in
these conditions. In support of this, Houlden et al.
administered6-hydroxy-dopamine, which results in
a potent increase in systemic noradrenaline release,
to mice and observed a decrease in the abundance
of Prevotellaceae.74 Additionally, recent preclinical
data suggest that the gut microbiota can influence
the severity of neurological damage following spinal
cord injury.76
An additional complication associated with
stroke is poststroke infection, which has a high mor-
tality rate. Evidence suggests that the gut microbiota
can influence the severity of poststroke infection.
For instance, poststroke infection was observed only
in specific pathogen–free mice and not germ-free
mice, indicating that the bacteria driving the sys-
temicinflammationfollowingstokeoriginatedfrom
within the host.69 Moreover, it has been demon-
strated that, following MCAO in mice, there is an
increase in intestinal permeability, which suggests
that intestinal bacteria are capable of translocating
from the lumen of the gut into the systemic circu-
lation whereby they can invade other organs (i.e.,
the lungs) and elicit an inflammatory response.69 In
support of this, 16S sequencing of the lung micro-
biota revealed an increase in bacterial species in
the lungs that were predicted to originate from the
small intestine.69 Thus, it appears that the intestinal
microbiota can not only influence the neuroinflam-
matory status through influencing T cell migration
to the brain but also systemic inflammation follow-
ing stroke through bacterial translocation from the
gut into the circulation, whereby they can invade
other organs. On the basis of these results, target-
ing the increased intestinal permeability in stroke
patients may help to limit bacterial translocation
leading to sepsis. Moreover, developing a probiotic
strain that could modulate T lymphocyte signal-
ing to the brain may help to ameliorate the neu-
roinflammatory status in patients following stroke.
While data are currently limited, there is some pre-
clinical evidence to suggest that probiotic strains
can ameliorate the neurological damage caused
by stroke. Clostridium butyricum, for instance,
prevented neuronal apoptosis mediated by bilateral

while also improving performance in the Morris
water maze task, suggesting an improvement in
cognition in these animals.77 This bacterial strain
also increased levels of beneficial gut bacteria, such
as Bifidobacteria, Lactobacilli, and Fecalibacterium
prausnitzii, in BCAO mice.77
Microbiota and stress-related disorders
Accumulating evidence suggests that there is dysreg-
ulation to the microbiota–gut–brain axis in stress-
related disorders, such as depression and anxiety.
Understanding how the gut microbiota is affected
in such conditions will allow for the development of
microbiota-based therapies, which may provide us
with safer and more efficacious treatment options
for such conditions.
Depression
Evidence for a role of the gut microbiota in depres-
sion and other stress-related disorders has pre-
dominantly arisen from preclinical studies (for
reviews on this topic, see Refs. 4, 14, 18, and 78).
For instance, it was recently shown that chronic
stress results in dysregulation of the microbiota and
metabolome of rats, with decreases observed in the
Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and, more specifi-
cally, decreases in the relative abundances of Lac-
tobacillus and increases in Oscillibacter.79 While the
preclinical evidence is rather compelling, only a few
clinical studies to date have performed microbiota
analysisindepressedpatientstoassessforanypoten-
tial dysregulation. We have recently combined both
clinical and preclinical research to demonstrate how
the microbiota–gut–brain axis is affected in depres-
sion. Depressed patients were found to have a dys-
regulated microbiota, observed as a reduction in
species richness and microbial diversity.80 Interest-
ingly, when the fecal microbiotas of these depressed
patientsweretransplantedintomicrobiota-depleted
(antibiotic cocktail) rats, the depression behavioral
phenotype was also transferred into the animals.80
Rats that received the microbiota from depressed
patients displayed a dysregulated microbiota them-
selves, along with an anhedonic and anxiety-related
behavioral phenotype. Moreover, these animals dis-
played an elevated kynurenine/tryptophan ratio,
indicating that perhaps the depressed microbiota
is facilitating the conversion of tryptophan into
the deleterious metabolite kynurenine, which is
implicated in depression.80 Zheng et al. corrobo-
rated these results when they demonstrated that
transplantation of a dysregulated microbiota from
depressed humans to germ-free mice conferred a
depressive-related phenotype in these animals.81
Recent work from De Palma et al. also demonstrated
the successful transfer of behavior from humans to
mice following microbiota transplantation. Trans-
plantation of microbiota from patients with irrita-
ble bowel syndrome with anxiety to germ-free mice
resulted in gastrointestinal symptoms and anxiety-
related behaviors in these animals.82 These findings
indicate that dysregulation to the gut microbiota is
capable of facilitating the behavioral and physiolog-
ical symptoms of depression and anxiety.
Microbiota-based therapies for the treatment
of depression
While a greater understanding is required as to how
the gut microbiota can mediate the behavioral and
physiological symptoms of depression, emerging
preclinical and clinical data are highlighting how
modulators of the gut commensals (i.e., prebiotics
and probiotics) may be an appropriate therapy for
depression and other stress-related disorders. For
instance, recent work from our group has shown
that a prebiotic combination of fructooligosaccha-
ride and galactooligosaccharide (GOS) improved
depression
and
anxiety-related
behavior
in
mice subjected to chronic psychosocial stress.83
Moreover, this prebiotic combination reduced
stress-induced activation of the hypothalamic–
pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis while also amelio-
rating dysregulation of the microbiota brought
about by chronic stress.83 Other groups have also
documented the beneficial effects of GOS and other
prebiotics on anxiety-related behavior in pre-
clinical models.84,85 Additionally, GOS supple-
mentation was found to lower the cortisol awak-
ening response in healthy volunteers while shifting
attention from negative toward positive stimuli,
demonstrating that the prebiotic also displays
efficacy in humans.86
The probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus
JB-1 has been shown to improve anxiety and social-
related behaviors in mice following chronic social
defeat,87 which is in line with previous work from
our group, which also demonstrated the beneficial
behavioral effects of this particular strain.88 Such
findings support the use of microbiota modulators

for the treatment of depression and stress-related
disorders. However, we must err on the side of
caution with our use of animal models for assessing
the efficacy of prebiotics and probiotics and how
this translates to the clinical setting. For instance,
we have recently shown that the L. rhamnosus
JB-1 strain, which has demonstrated efficacy
preclinically, displayed no effect in healthy male
volunteers in terms of cognition, subjective stress
measures, activation of the HPA axis, or immune
activation.89 A lack of clinical efficacy of L. rham-
nosus JB-1 may be due to the fact that mice possess
a different gut microbiota than that of humans and,
thus, may react differently to the probiotic strain.
Moreover, the two studies that demonstrated bene-
ficial behavioral effects in mice used either an inher-
ently anxious mouse strain (BALB/c) or employed
chronic stress to promote an anxious phenotype,
which would have different reactions to stress than
healthy male humans.87,88 Despite the probiotic
effects of L. rhamnosus JB-1 strain being somewhat
lost in translation, other candidate bacterial strains
have demonstrated efficacy as potential psychobi-
otics in humans. For instance, the probiotic strain
B. longum 1714 demonstrated efficacy in reducing
stress-induced cortisol release, along with attenuat-
ing daily self-reported levels of stress and improving
visuospatial memory in healthy male volunteers.90
A fermented milk product containing several dif-
ferent probiotic strains altered the activity of brain
regions associated with emotionality in healthy
female participants, suggesting potential psychobi-
otic potential.91 Moreover, a recent pilot study in
patients with irritable bowel syndrome demon-
strated that the probiotic B. longum NCC3001
improved scores of depression, but not anxiety,
while also improving gastrointestinal symptoms.92
While these studies are certainly promising, future
studies assessing the therapeutic potential of
psychobiotics for the treatment of depression
will require large-scale recruitment of depressed
patients to determine the extent of their efficacy.
In addition to prebiotics and probiotics, emerging
evidence has demonstrated that microbiota trans-
plantation is also capable of modifying behavior and
may be an effective treatment strategy for depres-
sion and other neuropsychiatric disorders.93,94
However, robust clinical data are required to
support the use of microbiota transplantation as a
potential treatment strategy for depression.
Microbiota, sociability, and
neurodevelopmental disorders
There is growing evidence to support a role for
the microbiota in regulating social behaviors in
mammals.4 How the gut microbiota modulates
social behavior remains to be fully elucidated. Given
the complexity and variability of the gut microbiota
from one species to another, identifying specific
microbial compositions or even specific bacterial
species that promote social behavior is challenging.
Moreover, the mechanisms through which the
gut microbiota promote social behavior remain
unknown. However, there is growing evidence to
suggest a role for microbiota modulation of certain
neurotransmitter/peptide systems in the brain.95,96
The gut microbiota influences social behaviors
The concept that the gut microbiota may influence
social behavior arose from experiments with
germ-free mice. Germ-free mice were found to have
deficits in social behavior in the three-chamber
interaction test.97,98 Germ-free mice exhibit social
avoidance behavior in this test, observed as an
increase in the time spent in the empty chamber
and a decrease in time spent in the chamber with
a novel conspecific mouse.98 This social deficit is
reversed following recolonization with microbiota,
further confirming that gut bacteria modulate social
behaviors. However, microbiota reconstitution did
not improve social cognitive deficits in the three-
chamber test, as these mice failed to spend more
time with a novel conspecific mouse over a familiar
animal.98 Moreover, the transfer of cued food infor-
mation through social contact and communication
in the social transmission of food preference test was
similar between conventional controls and germ-
free mice. Such results suggest that some facets of
social behavior are amenable through manipulation
of the microbiota, while others are not. Further
reaffirming this association between microbiota and
social behavior is that depletion of microbiota of
conventionally colonized mice following antibiotic
treatment also results in social deficits.99 Interest-
ingly, Arentsen et al. reported opposing behavioral
results, demonstrating that germ-free mice display
increases in social behaviors in the three-chamber
test relative to specific pathogen–free mice.100 This
may be due to differences in performing the three-
chamber social interaction test or to differences in
animal breeding/husbandry techniques.

The gut microbiota in brain health and disease
A growing body of evidence suggests that, in
a variety of animal models of autism spectrum
disorders, there is an altered microbiota composi-
tion. For instance, in the in utero valproate animal
model of autism, the pups display an autistic-like
phenotype along with intestinal inflammation and
dysregulation to the microbiota.101,102 Specifically,
these animals display an increase in the Firmi-
cutes/Bacteroidetes ratio along with increases in
cecal butyrate concentrations, suggesting alter-
ations to microbial metabolism.101 Interestingly,
there were specific increases reported in the
operational taxonomic units assigned to the genera
Alistipes, Mollicutes, Lactobacillales, and Enterorhab-
dus in valproate in utero–exposed males. Given that
autism is more prevalent in males than in females,
perhaps the microbiota has a bearing on the greater
risk of autism in males than in females. Alterations
in gut microbiota composition have also been
reported in other environmental models of autism,
such as the maternal immune activation model,
suggesting that exposure to an in utero stress (i.e.,
teratogens or inflammagens) negatively affects gut
commensals and behavior.103 Genetic animal mod-
els of autism allow us to investigate the relationship
between the host genome and the microbiota. The
BTBR animal model of autism displays a robust
autistic-like phenotype, with deficits in social
behaviors, repetitive behaviors, and anxiety-related
behaviors frequently reported.104–106 Recently, it
was demonstrated that BTBR mice display a reduc-
tion in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, along
with increases in the abundance of species such as
A. mucinphilia and reductions in Bifidobacterium
spp, suggestive of microbiota dysregulation.107 This
strain may prove a useful model for dissecting
the association of host genetics and microbiota in
facilitating an autistic-like phenotype.
Microbiota-based therapies for the treatment
of autism: hype or hope?
Although more insight is required into how gut
bacteria influence social behaviors and other behav-
ioral aspects associated with autism, recent evidence
suggests that modulating the microbiota through
diet, probiotics, and microbiota transfer is capa-
ble of modifying some aspects of behavior relevant
to autism. While most studies that have demon-
strated the beneficial effects of modulating the
microbiota have been preclinical, a recent small
open-label study by Kang et al. demonstrated that
transfer of a standardized human gut microbiota
mixture was capable of improving gastrointestinal
and behavioral symptoms in autistic children.108
Moreover, these improvements to the gastrointesti-
nal and behavioral symptoms through microbiota
transfer were maintained for up to 8 weeks follow-
ing the cessation of the therapy, suggesting that
the intervention had long-lasting effects on the
microbiota.108 While these results are preliminary
and lack appropriate controls, it lends support to
the use of microbiota-based therapies in the future
tomanagethegastrointestinalandbehavioralsymp-
toms of autism. However, as autism is a genetic
disorder,109 more research is needed to investigate
the relationship between host genetics and the gut
microbiota in shaping behaviors in autism.
Emerging preclinical research suggests that can-
didate bacterial strains are capable of improv-
ing the core behavioral symptoms of autism. In
the maternal immune model of autism, Hsiao
et al. demonstrated that B. fragilis was capable of
improving stereotyped and anxiety-related behav-
iors in this animal model while also improving
intestinal permeability.103 This led Gilbert et al. to
provocatively and, perhaps prematurely, propose
the concept of probiotics for treating autism.110
More recently, Buffington et al. identified that, in
an animal model of autism (offspring of moth-
ers fed a high-fat diet), fecal levels of Lactobacil-
lus reuteri were lower compared with nonautistic
controls.97 These autistic-like mice also displayed
reduced oxytocin immunoreactivity in the par-
aventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus.97
Interestingly, supplementation with L. reuteri ame-
liorated autistic-related behaviors in these mice
through enhancing oxytocin immunoreactivity in
the PVN of the hypothalamus.97 These behavioral
and physiological effects appeared to be specific
to L. reuteri, as supplementation with L. john-
sonii, which was also found to be reduced in these
mice with autistic-like behaviors, had no effect
on these parameters.97 Given the association of
oxytocin with social behaviors and autism, it is
likely that the hormone plays a role in the psy-
chobiotic effects of the bacterium. It may be a
peptide released from the bacterium, as health-
killed
L.
reuteri
failed
to
increase
oxytocin
immunoreactivity within the PVN,97 while lysed
L. reuteri was still capable of mediating this effect.111

 The gut microbiota in brain health and disease
Sherwin et al.
There remain several unanswered questions regard-
ing the prosocial effects of L. reuteri. For instance,
more information regarding L. reuteri’s effect on
other brain regions related to the processing of
social behaviors (i.e., the amygdala) is required. In
the study by Buffington et al., the authors noted
that there was no effect of the bacterial strain
on repetitive or anxiety-related behaviors. Thus, a
greater understanding of the neurocircuitry affected
in autism is required. Moreover, is this behavioral
effect a direct consequence of consuming L. reuteri?
Or does this bacterial strain alter the host micro-
biota, which then improves social behavior? Aside
from probiotics, the SCFA butyrate has recently
been shown to improve autistic-related behaviors
in BTBR mice.106 Butyrate treatment improved
deficits in social and repetitive behaviors in BTBR
mice while also modulating the expression of genes
related to excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmis-
sion, suggesting that such microbial metabolites
may present a potential therapeutic opportunity for
the treatment of autistic behavior.106
Microbiota and addiction
While considerable advances are being made with
regard to the role of the microbiota–gut–brain axis
in conditions, such as neurodegenerative diseases,
and psychiatric conditions, such as depression, little
is known with regard to the role that gut microbes
playinsubstanceabusedisorders.Whenweconsider
drug addiction and any potential association with
a dysregulated microbiota, it is important to con-
sider comorbidities, such as depression and anx-
iety. Moreover, adequate and nutritional dietary
intake is likely to be lacking in drug addicts, which
may also affect the composition of the microbiota.
Finally, many pharmacological agents,112 includ-
ing psychotropics,113 can have direct effects on the
microbiota, which complicates any interpretation.
Nonetheless, there is growing evidence that the
microbiota can modulate behaviors and physiolog-
ical changes relevant to substance abuse.
Alcohol
Chronic abuse of alcohol can lead to several serious
health complications, such as addiction, nutrient
deficiency, liver disease, and colorectal cancer.
Moreover, chronic alcohol exposure can lead to
psychological and cognitive deficits, such as major
depression and Korsakoff’s syndrome. Recent
preclinical and clinical data suggest that chronic
alcohol consumption can negatively affect the gut
microbiota, which is perhaps not all that surprising
given that ethanol is consumed via the gastrointesti-
nal system.114,115 Recently, it was shown that chronic
ethanol consumption in alcoholics results in alter-
ations to their microbiota; decreasing the relative
abundanceoftheBacteroidetesphylumandincreas-
ing the relative abundance of Proteobacteria.116
Intestinal permeability is also found to be increased
in a subset of alcoholics, increasing the risk for
bacterial translocation in these individuals.117
Moreover, alcoholics with increased intestinal per-
meability also displayed a dysregulated microbiota,
with increases in the Blautia and Megasphera gen-
era, and decreased levels of the anti-inflammatory
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii.117 F. prausnitzii has
been shown to inhibit the production of the proin-
flammatory cytokine IL-8 in vitro, demonstrating
its anti-inflammatory potential.118 Interestingly,
low levels of F. prausnitzii were correlated with
elevated levels of circulating IL-8 in alcoholics
with increased intestinal permeability, suggestive
of proinflammatory immune activation.117 Addi-
tionally, the psychological status of alcoholics with
increased intestinal permeability was worse than
that of controls and alcoholics with regular intesti-
nal permeability, which suggests that a dysregulated
microbiota–gut–brain
axis
is
facilitating
the
psychological symptoms observed in alcoholics.117
Recent work from our group demonstrated that
chronic intermittent ethanol exposure in mice,
which models chronic alcohol exposure in humans,
resulted in an increase in the Allistipes genera along
with a reduction in Clostridium cluster IV.115 Bac-
terial species found within Clostridium cluster IV,
such as F. prausnitzii, possess anti-inflammatory
properties.114 Thus, a loss of this genus following
chronic alcohol exposure may promote a proinflam-
matory immune state in the gastrointestinal system.
In support of this, germ-free mice that were human-
ized with the microbiota of alcoholics with hepatitis
displayed a higher level of inflammation and per-
meabilityoftheintestinecomparedwithcontrols.114
Moreover,themicrobiotaofthesehumanizedgerm-
free mice lacked known beneficial bacteria, such
as F. prausnitzii, and contained bacterial species
that have been previously associated with intestinal
inflammation, such as Bilophila wadsworthia.114,119
Thus, chronic alcohol exposure appears to lead to a

The gut microbiota in brain health and disease
dysregulation in the composition of the microbiota;
promoting a proinflammatory state within the gut,
which could affect the microbiota–gut–brain axis
and behavior in these individuals.
Cocaine and cannabis
Data regarding the effects of other drugs of abuse
upon the microbiota are currently limited. How-
ever, there is some preliminary evidence to suggest
that certain drugs, such as cannabis and cocaine,
affect the microbiota–gut–brain axis. Depletion
of the murine gut microbiota with an antibi-
otic cocktail served to enhance unbiased condi-
tional place preference for cocaine, which was
reversed following treatment of antibiotic-treated
mice with SCFAs.120 Such data indicate that the
gutmicrobiotacaninfluencedrug-seekingbehavior.
�9-Tetrahydrocannibinol (THC), the active psy-
chotropic chemical in cannabis, was shown to alter
the microbiota of mice, observed as an increase
in Clostridium leptum and decreases in Roseburia
species.121 Moreover, in diet-induced obese mice,
THC lowered the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio
while also increasing A. muciniphilia, a bacterial
strain that has been previously associated with
weightloss,reducinginsulinresistance,andimprov-
ing intestinal barrier function.122 Whether THC
affects gut–brain signaling to improve weight loss
(i.e., modulation of satiety peptides) is unknown.
However, such preliminary data warrant a greater
investigation into how THC can influence gut
microbiota composition and weight loss. While
more work is required into understanding how
drugs of abuse, such as cannabis and cocaine, affect
the microbiota and, subsequently, the gut–brain
axis, these studies provide an insight into how this
axis may be affected in addicts.
The diet–microbiota–gut–brain axis:
toward nutritional psychiatry
Diet has been shown to have an important bear-
ing on the composition of the microbiota.123 For
instance, the fecal microbiota of the rural Hadza
community, who mostly forage in the wild for their
diet, was found to be unique from that of a West-
ernized population.124 Moreover, the diets of West-
ernized countries are found to be suboptimal with
respect to the consumption of nutrients and high
in saturated fats, which may help to explain the
prevalence of diseases and psychiatric conditions
in such countries.125,126 It is important to consider
the factors that have driven the evolution of the
Westernized microbiota from that of more rural
microbiotas, such as that of the Hadza community.
Sonnenburg et al. demonstrated that a diet con-
sisting of low microbiota–accessible carbohydrates
resulted in a reduction in the diversity of gut bac-
teria of mice (that harbored a human microbiota),
which was largely reversible following changing the
diet to a higher level of carbohydrates that bacteria
could consume. Interestingly, however, gut bacte-
rial diversity worsened across generations in mice
on a low microbiota–accessible diet, which became
less amenable to improvement following restora-
tion with a high-carbohydrate diet.123 The results of
this study highlight how the human gut microbiota
may have potentially evolved to be less diverse and
amenable to modulation following the movement
of humans from more indigenous, rural communi-
ties to Westernized lifestyles. Moreover, these results
mayhelptoexplainwhydiseasesandpsychiatricdis-
orders are more prominent in Western countries.
Despite this, modifying one’s diet has been shown
to improve many facets of behavior.
The consumption of a Mediterranean-style diet
(i.e., fruits, vegetables, unsalted nuts, fish, lean
red meat, etc.) is linked to a reduced likelihood
for the development of depression in comparison
to the Western-style diet, which is linked to a
greater risk for developing the mood disorder.126
Preclinical evidence has identified the beneficial
effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids. For instance,
perinatal omega-3 fatty acid supplementation
lowered stress-induced activation of the HPA axis
in adolescent mice while also enhancing cognition
in adulthood, demonstrating the beneficial effects
of dietary supplements on stress and behavior.127
Moreover, the omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic
acid and eicosapentaenoic acid have been shown to
improve anxiety and depression-related behaviors
in female rats.128 Given that stress-related psychi-
atric conditions are more prevalent in females, these
preclinical data suggest that diet may be an effective
strategy for treating stress-related disorders in
women. Until recently, most evidence regarding the
effect of diet on mood had been limited to animal
studies and observational studies in humans.126
However, in a recent randomized controlled trial
conducted by Jacka et al., the authors demonstrated
that a modified version of the Mediterranean diet

scale
(MADS) following the 12-week dietary trial.
While these are preliminary results, they are rather
promising, and they suggest that modifying one’s
diet to incorporate a more Mediterranean-style of
food intake is a beneficial strategy for the treatment
of depression. Indeed, dietary changes may be a
less-costly and safer strategy for the treatment of
mild depression for patients rather than conven-
tional antidepressant medication. However, much
more research is needed to give an evidence base to
such hypotheses.
Additionally, emerging preclinical data sug-
gest that the diet is also capable of improving
autistic-related behavior. For instance, a high-fat,
low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet has also been
shown to improve deficits in social behaviors
and repetitive behaviors in the BTBR mice as
well as in the environmental models of autism,
maternal immune activation, and valproate in utero
exposure.130–132 Moreover, a modified amino acid
diet (containing high concentrations of histidine,
lysine, and threonine, with low concentrations
of leucine, isoleucine, and valine) was shown to
improve repetitive self-grooming behavior in BTBR
mice while also attenuating mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in the prefrontal
cortex.133 Currently, there is little information
available as to whether the ketogenic diet or other
diets may improve behavioral symptoms in autistic
individuals. However, recently, it was demonstrated
that a 6-week gluten-free diet intervention was ben-
eficial in reducing gastrointestinal symptoms as well
as modestly improving the behavioral symptoms of
autism in children.134 While these studies highlight
the beneficial effects that diet may have upon
behavior, a greater understanding of the mecha-
nisms underlying how diet or dietary components
improves social behavior and mood is required.
Moving toward mechanisms
In the last number of years, there has been a clear
focus on understanding the mechanisms underlying
how microbiota can influence gut–brain function
(Fig. 3). It is clear that there are multiple mecha-
nisms through which gut bacteria can signal to the
brain, such as through the vagus nerve, immune
system, production of microbial metabolites, and
modulation
of
circulating
tryptophan.8,10,17,135
Understanding how the gut commensals modulate
behavior remains one of the biggest unanswered
questions in microbiota–gut–brain axis research.
However, emerging studies are providing some
insight into the mechanisms underlying how gut
bacteria influence social behaviors. In a recent study
from the Karolinska Institute, the authors identify
a role for bacterial-sensing molecules in regulating
social development.136 Genetic knockdown of the
peptidoglycan-sensing molecule PGLYRP2 was
found to increase social behaviors in both male
and female mice in the three-chamber test while
also modulating the expression of genes related to
synaptic plasticity.136 The authors argue that bacte-
rial components, such as peptidoglycan, cross the
blood–brain barrier during postnatal development
and bind to molecules, such as PGLYRP2, to influ-
ence neuronal circuits linked to social behaviors.136
Other
biological
mechanisms,
such
as
the
immune system and vagal signaling, are also likely
to mediate the gut microbiota’s influence on social
behavior. D’Mello et al. demonstrated that periph-
eral inflammation, mediated by bile duct ligation,
resulted in social withdrawal behavior in mice.137
This behavioral deficit was ameliorated following
treatmentofmicewiththeprobioticmixtureVSL#3,
indicating that gut bacteria can influence how the
immune system signals to the brain to modulate
behaviors, such as sociability and anxiety.137 In a
separate study, vagotomy blocked the anxiogenic
effects of intestinal colitis in mice, further corrobo-
rating that the vagal pathway is an important medi-
ator for the gut microbiota to influence behavior.138
Gut bacteria may also signal via the vagus nerve to
influence social behaviors. Oral administration of
the probiotic strain L. reuteri has been shown to
increase the central expression and secretion of the
prosocial hormone oxytocin in mice.97,139 However,
this effect of L. reuteri was lost following vagotomy,
indicating that gut commensals signal via the vagus
nerve to increase the synthesis and secretion of oxy-
tocin from the brain. The production of neuroactive
metabolites by gut bacteria may also influence social
behaviors. Levels of the microbial metabolite cresol,
were found to be elevated in the ceca of socially
withdrawn mice.61 Interestingly, in vitro experi-
ments demonstrated that cresol was capable of

in preclinical studies, with some clinical studies also demonstrating efficacy. However, a greater understanding of how the intestinal

inhibiting the expression of myelin genes and the
differentiation of oligodendrocytes.61 Thus, ele-
vated levels of cresol may be driving social avoid-
ance behaviors through modulating the expres-
sion of myelin-related genes. In support of this, we
have recently demonstrated that the gut microbiota
influences myelination in the prefrontal cortex of
mice.60 In addition to producing various bioactive
metabolites, the gut microbiota also synthesize var-
ious neurotransmitters, such as noradrenaline and
GABA.140,141 Moreover, certain spore-forming bac-
teria have been shown to influence the secretion of
serotoninfromenterochromaffincells,whichsubse-
quently influences local gut physiology.142 Whether
microbially derived neurotransmitters are capable
of reaching the brain and influencing their specified
circuitry and behavior is unknown. However, the
microbiota has been shown to influence the level
of some of these neurotransmitters in the brain.
For instance, germ-free mice display increased hip-
pocampal serotonin levels relative to conventionally
colonized animals.17,143 This is most likely due to the
observed increased availability of circulating tryp-
tophan in these animals owing to the absence of gut
bacteria that utilize the amino acid.17
The gut microbiota is also capable of influencing
anorexigenic signaling to the brain, thereby mod-
ulating feelings of satiety. Within the lumen of the
gastrointestinalsystem,thegutmicrobiotaisinclose
proximity to enteroendocrine cells, and evidence
suggests that gut microbes are capable of modu-
lating the secretion of satiety peptides from these
cells. Breton et al. demonstrated that the E. coli
chaperone protein caseinolytic protease (Clp) B is
capable of increasing plasma levels of the satiety
peptides glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and pep-
tide YY (PYY) while also suppressing food intake
and increasing neuronal activation within hypotha-
lamic nuclei that are associated with satiety.144
ClpB likely mediates this increase in GLP-1 and
PYY through activating melanocortin receptor 4
(MCR4) expressed on the cell surface of enteroen-
docrine cells. In support of this, ClpB was found to
beanantigenmimeticof�-melanocyte–stimulating
hormone (�-MSH), which binds to and activates
MCR4.145,146 In addition to indirectly activating
satiety-related nuclei in the brain through increas-
ing the secretion of GLP-1 and PYY, Breton et al.
also demonstrated that ClpB was capable of acti-
vating proopiomelanocortin neurons when applied

directly to hypothalamic sections.144 Thus, alter-
ations to the level of E. coli in the gut microbiota
are likely to have some bearing on satiety-related
behaviors. In support of this, plasma levels of ClpB
were found to be higher in female patients with eat-
ing disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa,
and binge-eating disorder),147 which suggests that
dysregulation to the microbiota, observed as an
increased production of ClpB, may be facilitating
such deleterious behaviors.
While a great deal of attention has been given to
understanding how the gut microbiota influences
processes in the CNS, it is also important to con-
sider the effect that gut commensals have on the
ENS. Proper functioning of the ENS is required for
physiologicalprocesses,suchasgutmotility,butalso
to ensure gut–brain communication. In the absence
of a microbiota, germ-free mice display reduced
excitability of after-hyperpolarization cells in the
myenteric plexus.148,149 A reduction in the neuronal
firing rates of these cells within the ENS of germ-free
mice is likely to affect proper signaling between the
gut and the brain that may help to explain some of
the behavioral deficits observed in these animals.150
Moreover, bacterial strains that have demonstrated
positive effects on behavior, such as L. reuteri and
L. rhamnosus JB-1, have also been shown to mod-
ulate excitability of the ENS, which is likely to have
some bearing on their psychobiotic effects.151,152
The bacterial strain B. fragilis, which has demon-
strated efficacy in improving autistic-related behav-
iors and ameliorating gastrointestinal permeability
in the MIA model of autism,103 has also been shown
to increase excitability of intestinal primary afferent
neurons.153 This effect of B. fragilis was found to
be dependent on its expression of the exopolysac-
charide polysaccharide A.153 The beneficial effects
of probiotics on behavior may depend on their abil-
ity to modulate neurotransmission within the ENS,
and future work should consider the role of the ENS
in this regard.
Conclusions and future perspectives
Since the gut microbiota was first proposed to influ-
ence human health over 100 years ago, our under-
standing of such a role has increased immensely.
Evidence now suggests that the microbiota, through
the bidirectional communication axis known as the
microbiota–gut–brain axis, is involved in physio-
logical processes, such as mood and aging. Dys-
regulation of the microbiota–gut–brain axis is now
emerging for a broad range of neurological and
psychiatric conditions from Parkinson’s disease to
depression. Preclinical studies have been beneficial
in elucidating how microbiota dysregulation is
involved in such conditions. Moreover, preclinical
studies have demonstrated the efficacy of modula-
tors of the microbiota (i.e., probiotics, prebiotics,
and diet), supporting their use as potential thera-
pies for conditions such as depression and autism.
However, caution must be taken with extrapolating
these preclinical results to the clinical setting, given
reports of probiotic strains displaying efficacy
in mice but not in humans. Going forward, a
greater emphasis should be placed on assessing
the therapeutic efficacy of diet or probiotics in
the clinical setting through conducting sufficiently
powered, rigorous clinical trials.
