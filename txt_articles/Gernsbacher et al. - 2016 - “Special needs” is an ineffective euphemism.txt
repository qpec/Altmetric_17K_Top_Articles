Abstract
Although euphemisms are intended to put a more positive spin on the words they replace, some euphemisms are
ineffective. Our study examined the effectiveness of a popular euphemism for persons with disabilities, special needs. Most
style guides prescribe against using the euphemism special needs and recommend instead using the non-euphemized
term disability; disability advocates argue adamantly against the euphemism special needs, which they find offensive. In
contrast, many parents of children with disabilities prefer to use special needs rather than disability. But no empirical study
has examined whether special needs is more or less positive than the term it replaces. Therefore, we gathered a sample of
adult participants from the general population (N = 530) and created a set of vignettes that allowed us to measure how
positively children, college students, and middle-age adults are viewed when they are described as having special needs,
having a disability, having a certain disability (e.g., is blind, has Down syndrome), or with no label at all. We predicted and
observed that persons are viewed more negatively when described as having special needs than when described
as having a disability or having a certain disability, indicating that special needs is an ineffective euphemism. Even
for members of the general population who have a personal connection to disability (e.g., as parents of children
with disabilities), the euphemism special needs is no more effective than the non-euphemized term disability. We
also collected free associations to the terms special needs and disability and found that special needs is associated
with more negativity; special needs conjures up more associations with developmental disabilities (such as intellectual
disability) whereas disability is associated with a more inclusive set of disabilities; and special needs evokes more
unanswered questions. These findings recommend against using the euphemism special needs.
Significance
Our research question grew directly from a real-world
problem. As the examples quoted in this study demon-
strate, the euphemism special needs occurs in everyday
vernacular as well as in the scholarly literature. Thus,
empirically examining the effectiveness of the euphemism
special needs is use-inspired basic research.
Background
Euphemisms are “expressions used in place of words or
phrases that otherwise might be considered harsh or
unpleasant” (Annan-Prah, 2015). Employees are not
fired; they are let go. Animals are not euthanized; they
are put to sleep. Humans don’t die; they pass away
(Crespo-Fernández,
2006).
In
years
past,
pregnant
women were referred to as being in a family way, and
children entering puberty were referred to as going
around the corner (Riggs, 2013). Euphemisms occlude
uncomfortable topics.
The word euphemism derives from the Greek word
eupheme, which is the act of using language to effect a
good omen (in contrast to blaspheme; Burkhardt, 2010).
When Portuguese sailors were forced to navigate The
Cape of Storms, they renamed the rocky headland The
Cape of Good Hope; when ancient Romans conquered
the city of Maleventum (which means bad result), they
changed the city’s name to Beneventum (now called
Benevento; Griffin, 1985). Euphemisms, words used to
effect good omens, have been popular for millennia.
In modern day, euphemisms are often used intentionally
to deceive or manipulate others. Rather than speaking of
economic recessions, politicians speak of minus growth;
rather than speaking of military attacks, they speak of
missions (Burkhardt, 2010); rather than bribes, they speak
of soft commissions (Rittenberg, Gladney, & Stephenson,
2016). Such Orwellian double-speak lives not only in the

 lexicons of politicians, but also the everyman. If we cannot
afford to buy a new car, we buy a pre-owned car rather
than a used car; if we cannot afford to fly first class, we fly
coach rather than second class (Burkhardt, 2010).
Euphemisms are believed to serve both those who pro-
duce them (speakers and writers) and those who receive
them (listeners and readers). Linfoot-Ham (2005, p. 228)
believes that euphemisms “protect the speaker/writer,
hearer/reader, or all of the above.” Bowers and Pleydell-
Pearce (2011, p. 2) believe that euphemisms “allow speakers
(and listeners) to think about issues that might otherwise
be avoided.” Allan and Burridge (1991, p. 11) believe that
euphemisms “avoid possible loss of face: either one’s own
face or … that of the audience.” However, laboratory studies
demonstrate that euphemisms are more likely to be pro-
duced in service of saving the producer’s face rather than
the recipient’s face (McGlone & Batchelor, 2003).
Although the explicit purpose of euphemisms is to avoid
offense, some euphemisms cause offense. Doctors can be
offended when they are called providers (Sergel, 2015).
Church members can be offended when they are called
customers (La Cour & Kromann, 2011). Patients can be
offended when their experience with cancer is euphe-
mized as a journey (Appleton & Flynn, 2014), and workers
can be offended when their employment termination is
conveyed as downsizing (Vickers, 2002). The very words
intended to sugar coat can be more distasteful than the
words the euphemisms displace.
Euphemisms
can
also
be
ineffective.
The
doctor-
preferred euphemism you have fluid on your lungs because
your heart is not pumping hard enough is no more effective
to patients at risk of
heart failure than the non-
euphemized term heart failure (Tayler & Ogden, 2005).
The nurse-preferred euphemism your weight may be dam-
aging your health is demonstrably less effective to patients
who are obese than the non-euphemized term obese (Swift,
Choi, Puhl, & Glazebrook, 2013; Tailor & Ogden, 2009).
The goal of our study was to examine the effectiveness of a
popular euphemism for persons who have disabilities.
Special needs as a euphemism for disability
Euphemisms for disability are popular—so popular that
style guides prescribe against using euphemisms for per-
sons who have disabilities. For example, the American
Psychological Association (2010, p. 76) tells writers to
“avoid euphemisms” for disability, such as “special, physic-
ally challenged, handi-capable” because those euphemisms
“are condescending.” Similarly, “bypass condescending eu-
phemisms” is a primary recommendation of the Re-
search and Training Center on Independent Living
(2013), who note that “terms such as special, handi-
capable, differently abled and challenged reinforce the idea
that people cannot deal honestly with their disabilities.”
The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association also
prescribes against using euphemisms for disability because
euphemisms cannot “hide disability, but they can produce
confusion” (Folkins, 1992).
Over the past few decades, the term special needs has
become a popular euphemism for disability (Berger, 2013).
Rather than identifying a person as having a disability or
having a certain disability (e.g., Anika is blind, Bruce has
ADHD), the person is euphemized as having special needs.
Figure 1 demonstrates the steeply rising popularity of the
term special needs, based on Google’s NGram count in
published books dating back to 1900. Currently, Google
Scholar indexes over a million scholarly articles with the
term special needs, and Amazon.com sells nearly 5000
books with the euphemism special needs in their title.
Special needs is an increasingly popular euphemism.
The origin of special needs as a disability euphemism is
unclear. Guralnick (1994) reports in the 1990s changing the
wording of a 1980s questionnaire for parents from handi-
capped children to children with special needs, suggesting
that the euphemism had taken hold by the end of the 20th
century. Figure 2 demonstrates the declining popularity of
the term handicapped based on Google’s NGram. Shapiro-
Lacks (2013) proposes that the euphemism special needs
morphed from the term Special Olympics, established in
the late 1960s, and the concept of special education, also
established in the 1960s. “At some point, people with dis-
abilities began to be referred to as special, our needs as
special needs, and our demographic as the special needs
population,” writes Shapiro-Lacks (2013).
However, special needs is not a legal term. In nearly a
thousand pages of US law, including the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act of 1965, the Rehabilitation Act
of 1973, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of
1990, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and
2014, the term special needs occurs only a dozen or so
times. And never once are children with disabilities or
adults with disabilities referred to as children with special
needs or adults with special needs. Rather, individuals with

 disabilities are always referred to in US law as individuals
with disabilities.
Federal laws use the term special needs only to refer to
the distinctive requirements of various groups. For ex-
ample, the 2004 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
tasks a federal research center to “examine the special
needs of limited English proficient children with disabil-
ities.” The 1984 amendment to the Vocational Education
Act tasks a state board to “assess the special needs of
groups of individuals,” and those groups include “indi-
viduals who are single parents or homemakers and indi-
viduals who participate in programs designed to eliminate
sex bias and stereotyping in vocational education.” The
1974 amendment to the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act tasks a state agency to assess the special
needs of the Commissioner of Education (a federal position
now called the Secretary of Education). Thus, federal laws
do not use special needs as a euphemism for disability.
Most style guides also prescribe against using the eu-
phemism special needs. For example, the National Center
for Disability Journalism (2015, p. 23) warns that “the word
special in relationship to those with disabilities is now
widely considered offensive because it euphemistically stig-
matizes” persons with disabilities. Therefore, the National
Center for Disability Journalism (2015, p. 23) advises to
“avoid using these terms [special and special needs]” and
instead “cite the specific disability or disabilities in ques-
tion.” Similarly, the Research and Training Center on Inde-
pendent Living (2013) advises that “the use of special needs
is offensive … Just say individuals with disabilities.”
Disability advocates argue adamantly against using the
euphemism special needs. Kailes (2010) deems special
needs “an offensive euphemism” that is “patronizing,
inappropriate, and distancing.” Woodward (1991) and
Linton (1998, p. 14) deem special needs a condescending
euphemism, promoted by paternalistic “do-gooders.”
Rucker (2014) deems special needs akin to other “socially
unacceptable words” and “ethnic/social slurs no longer
tolerated.”
Indeed,
in
an
international
survey
of
English-speaking persons with disabilities conducted
by the BBC, special ranks fourth in a list of terms con-
sidered offensive; special was barely beaten out by the
slurs spastic and retard (Ouch!, 2003).
Several campaigns have lobbied to remove the euphem-
ism special needs. Using social media, Lawrence Carter-
Long (Carter-Long, 2016) advanced the Twitter hashtag
#NotSpecial alongside the hashtags #SayTheWord and
#Disabled and UK television star Josh Reeves (Reeves,
2015) launched the #Don’tCallMeSpecial campaign. In the
Disability Studies literature, UK scholar Colin Barnes
campaigned to replace special education with inclusive edu-
cation, replace special educational needs with unmet educa-
tional needs, and replace the euphemism children with
special education needs (SEN) with the non-euphemized
term disabled children (Barnes & Sheldon, 2007).
However, parents of children with disabilities and profes-
sionals who work with children and adults with disabilities
are not nearly so comfortable with the non-euphemized
terms disabled and disability (Foundation for Jewish
Summer Camps, 2015; Steinberg, 2013). As one mother re-
lates, “I don’t like the term special needs, but … I don’t like
the word disabled or disability any better” (I Am The
Giraffe, 2010). Another mother relates, “Every single time I
use that term [special needs], I flinch inside; it just sounds
so…stiff. Still, it’s less harsh than the reality of disabled”
(Love That Max: Special Needs Blog, 2008). One father re-
lates, “I prefer the term special needs [because] I feel like it
is a little bit less derogatory,” and another father relates,
“special needs maybe sounds more positive, you know,
than disability” (Sams, 2012, p. 147).
The goal of our study was to examine empirically
whether the euphemism special needs is indeed more
positive than the non-euphemized term disability among
the general population, as well as among parents of chil-
dren with disabilities, people who provide services to
persons with disabilities, and other people with a per-
sonal connection to disability. We constructed a set of
vignettes, which we manipulated to allow us to answer
empirically the question of whether special needs is an
effective euphemism for disability.
Vignettes as a tool for studying attitudes
Vignettes, “short stories about hypothetical characters
in specified circumstances” (Finch, 1987, p. 105), were
pioneered in the 1960s as a tool to study attitudes
(Goldberg, 1968; Nosanchuk, 1972). Since then, vignettes
have been used to study a range of attitudes, most notably
prejudicial attitudes, including sexism (Baron, Burgess, &
Kao, 1991), racism (Gilbert, 1998; Haider et al., 2011),
ethnic prejudice (Hudley & Graham, 2001; Mills &
Gaia, 2012), religious prejudice (Pitner, Astor, Benbenishty,
Haj-Yahia, & Zeira, 2003), homophobia (St. Lawrence,
Husfeldt,
Kelly,
Hood,
&
Smith,
1990),
xenophobia

 (Caprariello, Cuddy, & Fiske, 2009), and ableism (prejudice
against disabled people; Butler & Gillis, 2011; Grewal, Joy,
Lewis, Swales, & Woodfield, 2002; Matthews, Ly, &
Goldberg, 2015; Nevill & White, 2011; Werner, 2015).
Vignettes are ideal for answering our research question
because they allow subtle manipulation; in fact, the
manipulation can be limited to only one or two words.
For example, to examine whether racism affects hiring
decisions, employers can be given identical descriptions
of job applicants that differ only by the applicant’s
name (e.g., Jamal Jones versus Greg Jones; Bertrand &
Mullainathan, 2004). To examine whether sexism affects
teaching evaluations, university students can be given
identical descriptions of instructors that differ only by the
instructor’s gender (Kierstead, D’Agostino, & Dill, 1988).
Via manipulation of only one or two words, vignettes
have been used to examine a range of use-inspired re-
search questions, including driving accident responsibility
(Davies & Patel, 2005) and sexual assault culpability
(Neal, 2015). Most relevant to our study, vignettes have
been used to examine the effectiveness of euphemisms
(e.g., referencing used cars as pre-owned or bribes as soft
commissions; Gladney & Rittenberg, 2005; Rittenberg
et al., 2016). However, to our knowledge, no study has ex-
amined the effectiveness of the euphemism special needs,
which was our study’s goal.
Overview of the current study
To examine empirically the effectiveness of the euphemism
special needs, we constructed several vignettes. An example
appears in Table 1. Each vignette described an envisioned
situation in which participants were tasked with choosing a
character. For example, in the vignette presented in Table 1,
participants envisioned being a university freshman who
has decided to live in the dormitories; therefore, the partici-
pants were tasked with choosing a roommate. For another
vignette, participants envisioned being a second-grade
teacher whose principal needed to place one more child in
their already full-to-capacity class; therefore, participants
were tasked with choosing a new second-grade student. As
another example, participants envisioned being a middle-
age employee who is told to complete an important project
in collaboration with a co-worker; therefore, participants
were tasked with choosing a workplace collaborator.
For each vignette, participants chose among four char-
acters (e.g., roommate A, B, C, and D). Participants
ranked their choices first to last. Using a within-subjects
design, we manipulated the following three experimental
conditions:
Has a disability: The to-be-chosen character was
described as having a disability, for instance,
“Roommate B is an 18-year-old business major and
has a disability.”
Has a certain disability: The to-be-chosen character
was described as having a certain disability, for instance,
“Roommate B is an 18-year-old business major and
is blind.”
Has special needs: The to-be-chosen character was
described as having special needs, for instance,
“Roommate B is an 18-year-old business major
and has special needs.”
We also manipulated a fourth, no-label control condition:
No label (control): The to-be-chosen character was
not described with any label, for instance, “Roommate B
is an 18-year-old business major.”
With these found conditions we were able to test the
effectiveness of the euphemism special needs against the
non-euphemized term disability. We were also able to
test the effectiveness of the euphemism special needs
against the label of a specific disability (e.g., is blind).
And we were able to test the effectiveness of the euphem-
ism special needs against no label at all in our control con-
dition. If special needs is an ineffective euphemism, then
Table 1 Example vignette
You are a freshman about to enter your first year of college at a large
state university. You decide to live in the dormitories and need to
select a roommate. Based on the following descriptions, select your first,
second, third, and fourth choice for the person you would like to have
as a roommate.
Roommate A is a 19-year-old history major. Roommate A is from a small
town, 40 minutes away. Roommate A likes to play soccer, and watch
movies, with an extensive DVD collection that they are planning to
bring to your dorm room. Roommate A prefers to study at the library.
Roommate A is in a serious romantic relationship that started in high
school and might have their significant other visiting in your room,
even overnight.
Roommate B is an 18-year-old business major and has special needs
(material set 1).
Roommate B is an 18-year-old business major and has a disability
(material set 2).
Roommate B is an 18-year-old business major and is blind
(material set 3).
Roommate B is an 18-year-old business major (material sets 4, 5, and 6).
Roommate B is from a small town, four hours away. Roommate B enjoys
hiking, camping and going on long runs, and is a vegan. Roommate B
studies mainly at the library. When in your room, Roommate B will be
very social and keep your dorm room door open to everyone on
your floor.
Roommate C is a 19-year-old Spanish major. Roommate C is from out
of state. Roommate C likes being active, hanging out with friends, and
practicing the guitar in your room. Roommate C is a morning person,
going to sleep around 9:30 p.m. and waking up around 6:00 a.m. every
day. Roommate C will use those early mornings to study. Roommate C
is personable and loves to talk but can also be a bit intense.
Roommate D is an 18-year-old psychology major. Roommate D is from
the largest city in the state. Roommate D likes to draw, play tennis, and
listen to loud music. Roommate D always studies with music playing
through their headphones. Roommate D is a night owl and, as an only
child, has never shared a room before.

 characters described as having special needs should be
more likely to be chosen last, which is what we predicted.
Indeed, we predicted that characters described as having
special needs would be chosen last even more often than
characters described as having a disability and characters
described as having a certain disability (e.g., is blind).
The to-be-chosen character was a child in a third of
our vignettes, was a college student in a third of our
vignettes, and was a middle-age adult in a third of our
vignettes. Therefore, we could investigate whether special
needs is an ineffective euphemism regardless of the age of
the person being described.
After reading all the vignettes and ranking all the to-
be-chosen characters, participants provided free associ-
ations to the terms special needs and disability. We
predicted that participants would have more negative
associations to the euphemism special needs than to
the non-euphemized term disability. Although our
sample of research participants was drawn from the
general population of US adults, we collected demo-
graphic information that allowed us to examine our re-
search questions with participants who have a close
relationship to disability (e.g., as parent of a child with
a disability or as a professional who works with persons
with disabilities) compared with participants who do
not have a close relationship to disability.
Methods
Materials
Six vignettes were written and are available at http://
www.gernsbacherlab.org/, as well as http://dx.doi.org/
10.17605/osf.io/nyv4s. For two of the six vignettes, the
to-be-chosen character was a college student, either a
dorm roommate for freshman year or a week-long cabin-
mate for an alternative spring break. For another two of the
six vignettes, the to-be-chosen character was a child, either
a new student in a second-grade classroom or a new player
for a youth-basketball team. For the remaining two vi-
gnettes, the to-be-chosen character was a middle-age adult,
either a workplace collaborator or a cooking class partner.
For each of the six vignettes, descriptions of four
characters were written. As Table 1 illustrates, the four
descriptions stated several facts about each character.
For example, for the freshman dorm roommate vi-
gnette, each description stated the roommate’s major
(e.g., business; history; Spanish); the roommate’s home-
town (e.g., from a small town, 40 minutes away; from out
of state; from the largest city in the state); the roommate’s
hobbies (e.g., likes to watch movies; enjoys hiking; likes
hanging out with friends); where the roommate prefers to
study (e.g., library; dorm room); and a one-sentence des-
cription of the roommate’s personality and behavior (e.g.,
is personable and loves to talk but can be a bit intense).
To avoid gender bias, none of the descriptions identi-
fied the to-be-chosen character’s gender. A series of pilot
studies ensured that the four character descriptions for
each of the six vignettes were roughly equivalent in
preference prior to our adding information about the
character’s special needs or disability.
Six material sets were formed, as illustrated in Appendix
Table 2. Each of the six material sets contained each of the
six vignettes, in the same order (e.g., the freshman room-
mate vignette preceded the new second-grade student
vignette, which preceded the middle-age adult workplace
collaborator vignette, and so forth in all six material sets).
To occlude the purpose of the study, only three of the six
vignettes in each material set were assigned to the three
experimental conditions; the other three vignettes in each
material set were assigned to the fourth, no-label control
condition.
Six different disabilities were used for the certain dis-
abilities. Each of those six disabilities was assigned to
only one to-be-chosen character and only one vignette:
is blind (freshman roommate B), has epilepsy (workplace
collaborator C); is autistic (new basketball team player
D); has Down syndrome (new second-grade student B);
has ADHD (spring break cabin-mate C), and is deaf
(cooking class partner D).
Therefore, in each of the six material sets, only one of the
24 to-be-chosen characters was described as having a cer-
tain disability (e.g., is blind). Similarly, in each of the six ma-
terial sets, only one of the 24 to-be-chosen characters was
described as having a disability, and only one was described
as having special needs. By applying our experimental ma-
nipulation to only three of the 24 to-be-chosen characters,
we could better occlude the purpose of the study.
Procedure
Participants were recruited to the study naïve to the
study’s purpose. The study was titled, “Person Judgment
Study,” and participants were told that they would par-
ticipate in “a study in which you will read scenarios and
rank preferences for people.”
Participants read each of the six scenarios; following
each scenario, participants chose among the four charac-
ters, ranking their choices first to last. After reading all
the vignettes and ranking all the to-be-chosen charac-
ters, participants completed a brief questionnaire soliciting
the following demographic information: age; gender iden-
tity; where participants had lived the majority of the past
five years; whether participants were native speakers of
English; whether participants were university or college
students, parents of elementary school age children,
teachers of elementary school age children, middle-age
adults, or middle-age adults with work responsibilities
that include supervising other people (life roles captured
in the vignettes); and whether participants were persons

 with a disability, parents of a child with a disability, rela-
tives of a person with a disability, co-workers of a person
with a disability, or good friends with a person with a dis-
ability (demographic information that allowed us to distin-
guish between participants with versus without a personal
connection to disability).
It is important to stress that participants’ demographic
information was not collected until after the participants
completed reading all the vignettes and ranking all the
to-be-chosen characters from first to last. Thus, the par-
ticipants had no reason to believe that the purpose of
the vignette task was related to disability.
Finally, the participants responded to two open-ended
statements: “When I hear the term ‘special needs,’ the
first few thoughts that come to my mind are ____” and
then “When I hear the term ‘has a disability’ or ‘has
disabilities,’ the first few thoughts that come to my mind
are ____.” Participants were provided with five places to
provide up to five free associations for each of the two
statements. Again, it is important to stress that the par-
ticipants’ free associations were not collected until after
the participants completed reading all the vignettes and
ranking all the to-be-chosen characters.
Participants
The participants were 530 adults recruited through
Amazon Mechanical Turk and compensated $2 for their
participation in the 20-minute study. All participants
were required to have a 93% or greater approval rating
from their previous work on Mechanical Turk.
Participants were randomly assigned to one of the six
material sets. Data from three participants were ex-
cluded because the participants responded too methodi-
cally (i.e., ranking the character presented first as their
first choice, the character presented second as their
second choice, the character presented third as their
third choice, and so forth). Each of the remaining 527
participants had resided in the USA for the majority of
the past five years and were native speakers of English.
The participants’ mean age was 30.2 years (standard
deviation (SD) = 8.9 years; range = 18–69 years). The
participants randomly assigned to the six material sets
did not differ in age (F(5,521) = 0.52, p = 0.761). Of the
527 participants, 66% identified as male gender, 33%
identified as female gender, and 1% identified outside
the gender binary. The participants assigned to the six
material sets did not differ in identifying as male versus
female gender (χ2(5) = 0.828, p = 0.975).
Twenty-nine percent of the participants identified as col-
lege students; 25% identified as middle-age adults; 10%
identified as parents of elementary-school children; 9%
identified as middle-age adults whose work responsibilities
include supervising subordinates; 2% identified as teachers
of elementary school children; and 38% identified as having
none of these life roles. These percentages sum to greater
than 100% because some participants identified as having
more than one of these life roles. Participants randomly
assigned to the six material sets did not differ in having
these life roles (χ2(5) = 8.828, p = 0.116; χ2(5) = 2.720,
p = 0.743; χ2(5) = 1.904, p = 0.862; χ2(5) = 4.598, p =
0.467; χ2(5) = 6.758, p = 0.239, respectively) or as having
none of these life roles (χ2(5) = 4.561, p = 0.472).
Thirty-seven percent of the participants identified as
having one or more personal connections to disability:
18% identified as a relative of a person with a disability;
16% identified as a good friend of a person with a dis-
ability; 6% identified as a person with a disability; 5%
identified as a co-worker of a person with a disability;
4% identified as working with children who have dis-
abilities; 4% identified as working with adults who have
disabilities; and 3% identified as a parent of a child with
a disability. These percentages sum to greater than 37%
because some participants identified as having more
than one personal connection to disability.
The majority of the participants, 61%, identified as not
having any personal connection to disability, and 2% did
not wish to identify whether they had a personal connec-
tion to disability. Participants randomly assigned to the
six material sets did not differ in their personal connec-
tion to disability (χ2(5) = 5.430, p = 0.365).

Characters’ frequency of being chosen last
Figure 3 presents the frequencies with which characters
were chosen last as a function of the four experimental
manipulations: “No Label”, the characters were serving
as a control and therefore no disability label was in-
cluded in the characters’ description (26.6 ± 2.2%, 95%
confidence interval); “Has a Disability”, the characters

characters’ description; Has a Disability, the characters were described as

as having a specific disability (e.g., “is blind”); and Has Special Needs, the
characters were described as having special needs. Error bars are ±95%

 were described as having a disability (33.4 ± 4.0%); “Has
a Certain Disability”, the characters were described as
having a specific disability (e.g., “is blind,” 34.7 ± 4.0%);
and “Has Special Needs”, the characters were described
as having special needs (40.4 ± 4.2%).
As Fig. 3 illustrates, a one-dimensional chi-square
goodness-of-fit test for mutually exclusive categories
indicated that the frequencies with which characters
were chosen last in the four experimental conditions
(No Label, Has a Disability, Has a Certain Disability,
Has Special Needs) differed significantly from chance
(χ2(3) = 15.16, p = 0.002).
As predicted, characters were significantly more likely
to be chosen last when they were described as having
special needs than when they were described as having a
disability (z = 2.362, p = 0.009, one-tailed). Similarly, and
as predicted, characters were significantly more likely to
be chosen last when they were described as having spe-
cial needs than when they were described as having a
certain disability (z = 1.908, p = 0.028, one-tailed).
Characters were also significantly more likely to be
chosen last when they were described as having special
needs than when no (disability) label was included (z =
6.008, p < 0.001, one-tailed). In contrast, characters were
equally likely to be chosen last when they were described as
having a disability as when they were described as having a
certain disability (z = −0.455, p = 0.653, two-tailed).
Thus, characters described as having special needs were
most frequently chosen last, indicating that special needs
is an ineffective euphemism. Characters described as hav-
ing special needs were chosen last even more frequently
than characters described as having a disability or a cer-
tain disability, suggesting that the euphemism special
needs conveys more negativity than the non-euphemized
term disability or the names of specific disabilities
(e.g., blind). If special needs was an effective euphemism,
then we would have observed that characters described as
having special needs were chosen last less often than char-
acters described as having a disability or a certain disability.
But, as predicted, we observed just the opposite.
The pattern of results illustrated in Fig. 3 was obtained
regardless of whether the to-be-selected character was a
child, college student, or middle-age adult (χ2(6) = 6.22,
p = 0.399). Thus, special needs is an ineffective euphemism
regardless of the age of the person to whom it is applied.
However, as illustrated in Fig. 4, one aspect of the pat-
tern of results was affected by whether the participants
had a personal connection to disability. Participants with
a personal connection to disability (37% of the sample)
were less likely than participants without a personal con-
nection to disability (61% of the sample) to choose char-
acters last when the characters were described as having
special needs (z = −2.284, p = 0.023, two-tailed). For the
other three conditions, participants with a personal
connection to disability resembled participants without a
personal connection to disability (z = −0.014, p = 0.992,
two-tailed, for “Has a Certain Disability”; z = −0.403, p =
0.689, two-tailed, for “Has a Disability”; and z = −0.616,
p = 0.535, two-tailed, for “No Label”).
As Fig. 4 illustrates, participants with a personal con-
nection to disability were equally likely to choose char-
acters last when the characters were described as having
special needs as when the characters were described as
having a disability (z = 0.433, p = 0.667, two-tailed) or a
certain disability (z = −0.108, p = 0.912, two-tailed). Thus,
even for participants with a personal connection to dis-
ability, the euphemism special needs conveys as much
negativity as the non-euphemized term disability or the
names of specific disabilities (e.g., blind), again indicating
that special needs is an ineffective euphemism.
Participants’ associations to the terms disability and
special needs
Participants’ associations to the prompts, “When I hear
the term special needs, the first few thoughts that come
to my mind are ____” and “When I hear the term has a
disability or has disabilities, the first few thoughts that
come to my mind are ____,” were coded by two of the
co-authors, naïve to the participants’ demographics. The
coders agreed on 96.83% of the codes and the disagree-
ments were resolved by consensus.
Participants had been given five slots into which to
write their associations to each of the two prompts
(the term special needs and the term has a disability
or has disabilities, which hereafter will be referred to
as disability). On average, participants provided the same
number of associations to special needs (M = 4.918;
SD = 0.522) as to disability (M = 4.934; SD = 0.442,
t(526) = 1.571, p = 0.117).
Fig. 4 Frequency with which characters were chosen last as a function
of four experimental manipulations (No Label, Has a Disability, Has a
Certain Disability, and Has Special Needs) and whether participants have
a personal connection to disability (e.g., is a relative, good friend,
or co-worker of a person with a disability; works with children or
adults who have disabilities; is a parent of a child with a disability;
or is a person with a disability). Error bars are ±95% confidence intervals

 Participants’ associations were classified into ten mu-
tually exclusive coding categories. Three of the ten
coding categories captured affective associations: posi-
tive (e.g., “strong,” “capable,” or “acceptance”), negative
(e.g., “annoying,” “helpless,” or “needy”), and neutral
(e.g., “different,” “lifelong,” or “born that way”). Approxi-
mately 40% of participants’ associations were coded as
belonging to one these three affective categories.
Four of the ten coding categories captured four types of
disability: physical disabilities (e.g., “paraplegic,” “wheel-
chair user,” or “amputee”); developmental disabilities
(“intellectual disability,” “autism,” or “Down syndrome”);
sensory disabilities (e.g., “blind,” “deaf,” or “can’t talk”),
and psychiatric disabilities (e.g., “mental illness,” “bipolar,”
or “depression”). Approximately 30% of the participants’
associations were coded as belonging to one of these four
types of disabilities.
The remaining three of the ten coding categories were
empathy
(e.g.,
“I
want
to
help”),
accommodations
(“wheelchair,” “special education”), and requests for
more information (e.g., “what’s wrong?”). Approximately
25% of the participants’ associations were coded as be-
longing to one of these three categories. The remaining
associations, which composed less than 5% of the associ-
ations, were considered un-categorizable.
Figure 5 presents the relative proportion of partici-
pants’ associations that expressed affective sentiments
(positive, neutral, and negative) as a function of whether
the participants were providing associations to the eu-
phemism special needs or the term disability. As Fig. 5
illustrates, participants’ affective associations to special
needs differed significantly from their affective associa-
tions to disability (χ2(2) = 17.1, p < 0.001).
Participants produced significantly more negative asso-
ciations to the euphemism special needs than to the
term disability (χ2(1) = 16.6, p < 0.001). Participants also
produced significantly fewer positive associations and
significantly fewer neutral associations to special needs
than to disability (χ2(1) = 6.12, p = 0.013 and χ2(1) = 4.70,
p = 0.030, respectively).
Participants produced significantly more negative and
fewer positive associations to the euphemism special
needs than to the term disability, regardless of whether
they had a personal association to disability. Across the
board, participants with a personal connection to dis-
ability provided fewer negative associations and more
positive associations than did participants without a per-
sonal connection to disability (χ2(2) = 55.8, p < 0.001).
Nonetheless, both participants with and without a per-
sonal connection to disability produced more negative
associations to special needs (41 and 54% of the partici-
pants’ affective associations, respectively) than to disability
(33 and 45%, respectively). Thus, participants’ personal
connection to disability did not diminish their negativity
to the euphemism special needs (χ2(1) = 0.012, p = 0.912).
Similarly, both participants with and without a per-
sonal connection to disability produced fewer positive
associations to special needs (25 and 14% of the partici-
pants’ affective associations, respectively) than to disability
(32 and 17%, respectively). Thus, participants’ personal
connection to disability did not increase their positivity to
the euphemism special needs (χ2(1) = 0.059, p = 0.808).
Figure 6 presents the relative proportion of partici-
pants’ associations that conveyed a type of disability
(developmental disabilities, physical disabilities, sensory
disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities) as a function of
whether the participants were providing associations to
the euphemism special needs or the term disability. As
Fig. 6 illustrates, participants associated significantly
different disabilities with special needs than with dis-
ability (χ2(3) = 233, p < 0.001).
Participants were significantly more likely to associate
developmental disabilities with the euphemism special
needs than with the term disability (χ2(1) = 202, p < 0.001).
Participants were significantly less likely to associate

 physical disabilities and sensory disabilities with special
needs than with disability (χ2(1) = 150, p < 0.001 and
χ2(1) = 29.6, p < 0.001, respectively). Participants were
equally likely to associate psychiatric disabilities with
special needs as with disability (χ2(1) = 0.079, p = 0.779).
Lastly,

likely
to
associate
“Requests for more information” with the special needs
(11%)
than
disability
(18%;
χ2(1) = 12.1,
p < 0.001).
Participants were equally likely to associate “Empathy”
with special needs (25%) and disability (28%; χ2(1) = 1.11,
p = 0.291). Participants were more likely to associate
“Accommodations”
with
special
needs
(64%)
than
disability (55%; χ2(1) = 11.8, p = 0.001). Many of the par-
ticipants’ accommodations-related associations to special
needs were related to special education or to “special”
organizations and activities (e.g., Special Olympics).
Discussion
The goal of our study was to examine empirically the
effectiveness of the euphemism special needs.
We constructed a set of vignettes which allowed us to
gauge how people who are described as having special needs
are viewed in relation to people who are described as having
a disability. If special needs is an ineffective euphemism, as
we predicted, then people described as having special needs
should be viewed more negatively than people described as
having a disability, which is what we observed. Indeed, as
we predicted, when people were described as having special
needs, they were viewed more negatively than when they
were described as having a specific disability (e.g., is blind,
has Down syndrome, is autistic, has ADHD).
We found that special needs is an ineffective euphem-
ism regardless of whether the persons being described
by the euphemism are children, college students, or
middle-age adults. Special needs is an ineffective eu-
phemism even in the eyes of people who have a personal
connection to disability, such as parents of children with
a disability or professionals who work with disabled chil-
dren or adults. Even for people with a personal connec-
tion to disability, the euphemism special needs is no
more effective than the non-euphemized term disability.
In our study, we also collected free associations to the
terms special needs and disability. We found that special
needs is associated with more negativity than disability;
special needs conjures up more associations to develop-
mental disabilities (such as intellectual disability, autism, or
Down syndrome) whereas disability is associated with a
broader, more inclusive set of disabilities; and special needs
evokes more unanswered questions than disability. These
associations again demonstrate that special needs is an in-
effective euphemism. We propose that special needs is an
ineffective euphemism because it is imprecise, it connotes
segregation, and it implies special rights; special needs has
become a dysphemism.
Special needs is imprecise
Euphemisms
are,
by
definition,
vague
expressions
(Ramsay, 2002). But the euphemism special needs is so
vague that it can be applied to a wide swath of individuals
in various contexts. In the realm of child adoption, indi-
viduals with special needs can be children with a “range of
conditions” that pose “a barrier to permanent adoption
placement” (Tan, Marfo, & Dedrick, 2007, p. 1270),
including being “minority and biracial” (Rosenthal &
Groze, 1990, p. 476). In disaster preparation, individuals
with special needs can be adults aged 50 years or older,
adults who receive home health care, or adults who do not
have access to a personal vehicle (Parsons & Fulmer, 2007).
In housing, individuals with special needs can be per-
sons experiencing “homelessness, psychiatric illness, drug
and alcohol rehabilitation, the elderly, HIV/AIDS, and
women escaping domestic abuse” (Wilton, 2002, p. 318).
In airline travel, they can be passengers with disabilities,
passengers traveling with infants or animals, passengers
traveling while pregnant, passengers requiring extra
seating, passengers with peanut allergies, children traveling
alone, and older adults (https://www.united.com/web/en-
US/content/travel/specialneeds/default.aspx).
As Clapham and Smith (1990, p. 194) lament, “the pre-
cise groups considered to have special needs varies consid-
erably and can include almost everyone.” For this reason,
Kailes (2005, p. 3) argues that “continuing to use special
needs does a disservice to every group included.” And
“repeated pleas, over the years, from disability advocates
to replace special needs, with more respectful, precise, seg-
mented, and discrete groupings” should not “be ignored.”
Special needs connotes segregation
We observed in our association data that the euphem-
ism special needs evokes associations to special educa-
tion, Special Olympics, and other special programs.
Because these special programs mostly segregate persons
with disabilities from persons without disabilities, special
needs often connotes segregation (Woodward, 1991).
Disability Studies scholars argue that special needs isolates
persons with disabilities from the general population
(Rucker, 2014) and creates distance between persons with
versus without disabilities (Finkelstein & Stuart, 1996).
As Australian Senator Susan Boyce warns, “Anytime we
allow people with a disability to be treated as special people
who should live or learn or work or spend their leisure
time in special places, we are shutting people with a dis-
ability out of the mainstream” (Australian Broadcasting
Company 2007). A public demonstration of the connota-
tion of special needs with segregation went viral a few years
ago. At a family restaurant in Houston, one family asked to
be re-seated farther away from another family which in-
cluded a five-year-old son with Down syndrome. The
father of the family who asked to be re-seated explained
Gernsbacher et al. Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications  (2016) 1:29 
Page 9 of 13
 his motivation with the statement, “special needs kids
should be kept in special places” (Broderick, 2013). Special
places, special programs, special schools, and special needs
connote segregation; in contrast, accessible places (rather
than special places) and inclusive programs (rather than
special programs) connote integration (Kailes, 2010).
Special needs implies special rights
Construing disability as special needs enables miscon-
struing as special rights what are actually human rights,
civil rights, or disability rights (Ballard, 1995). For example,
a recent article in The Chronicle of Higher Education
misconstrues legally mandated disability rights as special
rights. The article erroneously describes Section 504 of the
US Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimin-
ation on the basis of disability in federally funded pro-
grams, as legislating “special rights and remedies for people
with disabilities” (Rothstein, 2013). Section 504 does not
legislate special rights; it legislates civil rights and federal
protection from discrimination.
A more egregious misconstrual of basic rights as
special rights was demonstrated in a viral complaint that
a Canadian mother wrote to her neighbor (Daubs, 2013).
The complaint centered around the neighbor’s disabled
teenage grandson who plays joyously (and loudly) in his
grandmother’s front yard. Among other offensive com-
ments, the complaining mother wrote to her neighbor, “I
hate people like you who believe, just because you have
a special needs child, you are entitled to special treat-
ment.” The “special treatment” was simply the disabled
teenager’s basic right to play in his grandmother’s front
yard. But referring to disabilities as special needs could
have led to this teenager’s basic rights being misconstrued
as special rights (see also Finkelstein & Stuart, 1996).
Like disability rights advocates, gay rights advocates
have long argued that their rights should not be con-
strued as special rights. The GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian
Alliance Against Defamation 2016) Media Reference
Guide identifies special rights as offensive and equal
rights as preferred. As the Media Reference Guide ex-
plains, “Anti-gay extremists frequently characterize equal
protection of the law for lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans-
gender people as special rights to incite opposition” to
basic, human, and civil rights. The negative implication
of misconstruing human rights as special rights is un-
appreciated by many minority groups (Goldberg-Hiller
& Milner, 2003; Marcosson, 2012; Rubin, 1998).
Special needs has become a dysphemism
The data reported in this article suggest that special needs
is so ineffective as a euphemism that it has become a dys-
phemism, particularly for members of the general popula-
tion who do not have a personal connection to disability.
Dysphemisms are terms that begin as euphemisms but
become even more negative than the terms they were ini-
tially intended to euphemize (Gómez, 2009; Holder, 2002).
Many contemporary slurs for members of racial, ethnic,
or sexual minority groups began as euphemisms and be-
came dysphemisms. Pinker (1994) deems such linguistic
transition the euphemism treadmill.
Adams (1985, p. 44) explains that because euphe-
misms are “an effort to make something sound especially
nice … a euphemistic formation can easily turn into its
opposite.” The extreme effort to “prettify” a concept dra-
matizes not only the perceived negativity of the concept
but also the perceived negativity of its euphemism.
It is unsurprising that special needs has become a dys-
phemism. Other disability terms have become not only dys-
phemisms but also dysphemistic metaphors (Pfaff, Gibbs, &
Johnson, 1997). For example, among the definitions the
MacMillan Dictionary (http://www.macmillandictionary.-
com/us) provides for the term deaf is the denotation “not
willing to listen to something” (e.g., deaf to reason); for
blind, one denotation is “unable to realize or admit the
truth about something”; for crippled, one denotation is
“damage[d] severely” or “prevent[ed] from working proper-
ly”; and for lame, “done without much effort in a way that
seems as though you are not trying very hard.” Although
deaf, blind, crippled, and lame originated as disability terms,
they are now commonly used as dysphemistic metaphors.
The word dumb is now completely a dysphemistic
metaphor. Dumb initially bore only a disability-specific
denotation. It meant “permanently unable to speak.” But
as the MacMillan Dictionary reports, the disability-
related denotation of dumb is “now usually considered
offensive,” and the preferred terminology for someone
unable to speak is “speech impaired.” After dumb shed
its disability-specific denotation of “permanently unable
to speak,” it took on the disability-unrelated but still
speech-related denotation of “temporarily unable or
unwilling to speak, especially because you are very
shocked” (e.g., Some of the passengers were struck dumb
with terror or I was struck dumb by the clerk’s rudeness).
The current and most popular denotation of dumb as
“stupid” (e.g., She’s so dumb she can’t even figure out her
answering machine) refers not at all to speech but re-
flects the (erroneous) connotation that persons with
speech disabilities are intellectually inferior.
Our data suggest that special needs has already be-
come a dysphemism (a euphemism more negative than
the word it replaces). Special needs will likely become a
slur, if it is not already, and it might eventually become a
dysphemistic metaphor, akin to dumb, lame, crippled,
deaf, and blind. These linguistic transitions, along with
the data reported here, recommend against using the
euphemism special needs and instead using the non-
euphemized term disability.
