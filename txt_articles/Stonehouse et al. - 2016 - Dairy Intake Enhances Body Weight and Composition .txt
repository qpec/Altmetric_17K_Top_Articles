Abstract: Background/Aims: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed
to investigate the effects of dairy food or supplements during energy restriction on body weight and
composition in 18–50-year-old. Methods: RCTs ě 4 weeks comparing the effect of dairy consumption
(whole food or supplements) with control diets lower in dairy during energy restriction on body
weight, fat and lean mass were identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, Pubmed, Cochrane
Central and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP)
until March 2016. Reports were identified and critically appraised in duplicate. Data were pooled
using random-effects meta-analysis. Chi2- and I2-statistics indicated heterogeneity. Dose effect was
assessed using meta-regression analysis. GRADE guidelines were used to rate the quality (QR) of
the evidence considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias and
effect estimates. Results: 27 RCTs were reviewed. Participants consumed between 2 and 4 standard
servings/day of dairy food or 20–84 g/day of whey protein compared to low dairy control diets,
over a median of 16 weeks. A greater reduction in body weight (´1.16 kg [´1.66, ´0.66 kg], p < 0.001,
I2 = 11%, QR = high, n = 644) and body fat mass (´1.49 kg [´2.06, ´0.92 kg], p < 0.001, I2 = 21%,
n = 521, QR = high) were found in studies largely including women (90% women). These effects
were absent in studies that imposed resistance training (QR = low-moderate). Dairy intake resulted
in smaller loss of lean mass (all trials pooled: 0.36 kg [0.01, 0.71 kg], p = 0.04, I2 = 64%, n = 651,
QR = moderate). No between study dose-response effects were seen. Conclusions: Increased dairy
intake as part of energy restricted diets resulted in greater loss in bodyweight and fat mass while
attenuating lean mass loss in 18–50-year-old adults. Further research in males is needed to investigate
sex effects.

1. Introduction
Obesity is a global epidemic, with significant health and socio-economic costs [1]. Overweight and
obesity are major risk factors for non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
musculoskeletal disorders and some cancers [1]. Hence, the critical necessity to identify effective
strategies to reduce and maintain a healthy body weight.

Dairy in the diet may be an important modifiable factor for managing a healthy body weight and
composition due to its rich source of nutrients and bioactive compounds. Specifically, dairy contains
calcium which may increase faecal fat excretion [2]; protein (casein and whey) and their peptide
derivatives that promote muscle protein synthesis (hypertrophy) [3] and regulate appetite [4]; and fatty
acids (medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCT) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)) that affect energy balance
through reduced de novo lipogenesis, increased fat oxidation and regulating appetite [4,5]. Evidence from
observational studies suggests a protective effect of dairy food consumption on overweight and obesity
risk [6].
Lifestyle modification, incorporating an energy-reduced diet and increased physical activity, is the
cornerstone for achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight and composition. However, energy
restricted diets aimed at reducing body weight and fat mass often result in a concurrent unfavorable
lean mass reduction, accounting for ~20% of total weight loss [7]. Lean mass, particularly its skeletal
muscle component, is important for regulation of resting energy expenditure, protein metabolism,
physical strength and function and is the body’s primary site of postprandial glucose uptake [8].
Effective weight loss strategies should therefore aim to reduce body weight by reducing body fat mass
whilst minimizing lean mass loss. Hence, identifying effective strategies that can promote healthy
body weight and composition is critical to combat the overweight/obesity epidemic.
Two previous meta-analyses have reported modest benefits of dairy food in adults ě18 years on
body weight and composition in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) imposing energy restriction [9,10].
Although Abargouei et al. [10] reported lean mass as an outcome, Chen et al. [9] which was a more
comprehensive meta-analysis, did not. Furthermore, neither meta-analysis considered dairy supplements
nor attempted to determine the dose of dairy required to improve body weight and composition.
The primary aim of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review and meta-analysis
of RCTs in 18–50-year-old investigating the effects of consuming whole dairy food or dairy protein
supplements (whey and/or casein) compared to a control intervention lower in dairy products during
energy restriction on body weight and composition (total fat mass and lean mass). Secondary aims were
to determine the critical dairy dose needed to achieve changes in body weight and composition and to
perform a priori subgroup analysis to investigate the influence of the following study characteristics
on the outcomes: addition of resistance training vs. no resistance training; whole dairy food vs.
dairy supplements; study duration <12 months vs. ě12 months; the influence of sex; and baseline
dairy intake.
If improved weight loss and body composition due to an increased intake (or particular dose) of
dairy products are confirmed through this meta-analysis of RCT it will provide the highest level of
scientific evidence to support recommendations and health claims for incorporating dairy products
into weight management programs. The evidence may also promote the development of innovative
food or therapeutic products for this purpose. Additionally, the review may identify gaps in the
current evidence that is required to satisfy health claims for the dairy industry.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Eligibility Criteria
Relevant published and unpublished studies were included if: they used an RCT study design;
were conducted in adults 18–50 years (the upper limit of the age range was flexible and studies
reporting an average age of ď50 years were also included); used interventions of ě4 weeks [8,9]
that primarily involved dairy products (whole dairy foods or dairy supplements) with comparison
to an appropriate control diet lower in dairy products; while prescribing energy restriction; and
included measures of body weight, fat mass and/or lean mass. Studies were excluded if: they involved
multi-component interventions where the effect of dairy could not be distinguished from other
components (e.g., another dietary factor added to the dairy, but not to the control, intervention; if the
same additional component was added to both dairy and control interventions (e.g., exercise training),
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 394

the research report was included); used a cross-over study design that do not permit return to equal
baseline following body weight/composition changes; used another dairy product or component
as comparison (e.g., whey vs. casein); included participants with a disease condition associated
with muscle wasting (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cancer, muscular dystrophy);
included participants who were pregnant or breastfeeding; or were not available in English language.
No exclusions were made based on sex, other pre-existing disease or physiological conditions (e.g.,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or metabolic syndrome).
Whole dairy foods were defined as including milk, yoghurt, cheese and custard and serving sizes
were based on the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating [11], namely: 250 mL milk and milk-based
beverages; 200 g yoghurt; 40 g hard, firm, soft and low fat cheese; 120 g cottage and ricotta cheese;
200 g custard; and 30 g powdered milk. Dairy supplements were defined as including whey and/or
casein protein in the form of whey and/or casein concentrates, isolates or hydrolysates. No relevant
studies using any other form of dairy supplements were identified.
2.2. Literature Search
Relevant original studies published to 22 March 2016 (first search conducted on 2 June 2014 and
updated on 22 March 2016) were identified by a comprehensive systematic search of scientific journal
databases (MEDLINE on Web of Science, EMBASE, Pubmed, Cochrane Central and World Health
Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and scanning reference lists
of included reports, key meta-analyses and reviews. Two search themes were specified based on the
dairy intervention and outcome variables using relevant medical subject heading (MeSH) terms and
key words. Dairy intervention search theme: The MeSH term dairy products captured the terms whey,
casein, milk, yoghurt (different spellings) and cheese; the following key words not captured by the
MeSH term were added: dairy bioactive (different spellings) and dairy calcium. Body Composition:
The MeSH term “body composition” was combined with key words weight loss, weight reduction,
weight change, fat mass, fat free mass (different spellings) and lean mass. The two themes were then
combined and further filtered by adults, English language, clinical trial and human. The following
is an example of the search syntax used for searching Pubmed: (((((“Dairy Products” (Mesh) NOT
margarine NOT “infant formula” NOT “human milk”)) OR (“dairy bioactive *” OR “dairy bio-active
*” OR “dairy calcium”))) AND (“Body Composition” (Mesh) OR “weight loss” OR “weight reduction”
OR “weight change” OR “fat mass” OR “fat free mass” OR “fat-free mass” OR “lean mass”)) AND
adult Filters: Clinical Trial; Humans.
2.3. Study Selection
All duplicate articles were removed. Relevant reports were identified in duplicate by two
independent investigators (PT, Paul Foster (PF)) by first screening the titles and abstracts followed by
the full text against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any disagreement was resolved by consensus with
a third investigator (WS) experienced in the field of nutrition interventions and body weight regulation.
2.4. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Detailed information needed for an in-depth assessment of the evidence were extracted from
the studies into pre-piloted extraction tables by two investigators (PT, PF). A third investigator (WS)
scrutinized the extractions for errors or inconsistencies. When necessary, errors or uncertainties were
resolved by discussion between investigators. The following critical information were extracted: first
author’s family name; year of publication; geographic location; primary objective; funding source and
conflict of interest; study design (duration, randomization procedures, blinding, treatment allocation
concealment); participant information (sample size (numbers enrolled and completed), attrition and
reasons, sex distribution, mean age, mean body mass index (BMI), inclusion and exclusion criteria);
potential confounding factors that was not controlled for was identified; details regarding intervention
and control regimes; mean dietary intakes (dairy, energy, macronutrients, calcium); exercise protocol
(when applicable); methods used to assess outcomes; outcome results; author’s conclusions and
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 394

contact details. The mean and standard deviation (SD) at baseline, end and change for body weight,
fat mass and lean mass were extracted. Fat free mass was extracted when lean mass was not available.
When multiple time points were reported only the end of intervention point was used. Since most
studies reported completer’s data and not intention-to-treat, data for completers were extracted except
in a few cases where only complier or intention-to-treat data was available. In cases where there were
multiple reports of the same study, the data were extracted from the most relevant report. One report
included more than one dairy intervention arm to investigate different dosages. In this case the data
were extracted as two separate comparisons (i.e., moderate dairy dose vs. control and high dairy dose
vs. control) [12].
A critical appraisal of studies was undertaken in duplicate by two investigators (PT, PF) using the
Health Canada Quality appraisal tool for intervention studies [13]. Disagreements were resolved by
consensus with a third investigator (WS) experienced in the field of nutrition interventions and weight
regulation. A quality score of ď7 was considered lower quality [13]. No studies were excluded based
on quality score, but sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of these studies on the
overall result.
2.5. Rating of the Quality of the Body of Evidence
The overall quality of the body of evidence was rated using the Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines taking into account the risk of bias,
inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias and assigning a quality level (high, moderate,
low and very low) that reflects confidence that the estimates of the effect are correct [14–18].
2.6. Statistical Analysis
A meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager (RevMan, version 5.2, The Cochrane
Collaboration, London, England, 2012).
For each outcome, the mean change and SD of change from baseline to endpoint for each
intervention group was entered into Review Manager. If the SD was not provided, it was calculated
from the standard error (SE) or 95% confidence interval (CI). If only baseline and end data was available
the mean change was calculated by deducting the baseline from the end value. The SD was then
imputed from a mean correlation coefficient of 0.97 calculated from other studies in the meta-analysis
that provided SDs for baseline, end and change values [19]. The correlation coefficient calculated
was only applied to studies of ď9 months duration, because fully reported data was not available
for studies of longer duration. SDs were imputed for three studies [20–22]. Study authors were
contacted for missing data or when results were presented in graphs. When no response was received
results presented in graphs were estimated by UN-SCAN-IT software for windows (version 7, Silk
Scientific Inc., Orem, UT, USA) or the data was not included in the meta-analysis. Data was unable
to be retrieved for two studies [23,24]. For studies with multiple comparisons where one group was
used more than once as a comparison group, the sample size of the specific group was divided by the
number of times the group was used as comparison to avoid data duplication and provide appropriate
weighting for the results.
The primary meta-analyses compared mean (95% CI) differences (net change in kg) in body weight,
fat mass and lean mass between high dairy and control groups. Due to heterogeneity between studies
and to avoid false positive results for subgroup analysis, a random-effects model was used to calculate
Forest plots with weighted mean differences and 95% CI. Heterogeneity between studies were indicated
using a combination of Chi2- (p < 0.1) and I2 statistics (I2 0%–40% = low; 30%–60% = moderate;
50%–90% = substantial and 75%–100% = considerable heterogeneity) and considering the variation of
point estimates and overlap of CIs across studies [17,19]. A priori subgroup differences (resistance
training vs. no resistance training) and whole dairy food vs. dairy supplements) were assessed using
Chi2-statistic with a p-value of < 0.05 taken to indicate statistical significance [19]. Subgroup differences
between studies using skim/low-fat dairy vs. studies that did not specify dairy type were also explored.
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 394
5 of 27
Subgroup analysis on study duration and baseline dairy intake could not be performed because of
limited number of studies that were >12 months duration or that reported dairy intake at baseline.
Subgroup analysis also could not be performed on sex because of the low proportion of men included
in studies.
Meta-regression was used to examine the effects of dairy food dosage on effect size (Metareg [25],
Stata SE 12.1, College Station, TX, USA), in a random effects analysis of univariate and multivariate
linear models. Analyses assuming quadratic relationships or more general curvature were not
performed. No attempt was made to include trials using dairy supplements in the same model
as trials using dairy whole foods because of the uncertainty of converting the intervention dose to
common units.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted by evaluating the impact of adding or removing reports with
different study characteristics. Sensitivity analysis was conducted on trials with high apparent bias,
trials with imputed data, trials with intention-to-treat data, trials reporting fat free mass (as opposed to
lean mass), trials where the difference in dairy servings between groups was <1 servings/day and
trials that included only men.
Publication bias was examined using funnel plots in which the SE of the studies were plotted
against their corresponding effect sizes.
3. Results
3.1. Literature Search Results
The number of studies assessed at each stage of the identification filtering process are summarized
in Figure 1. A total of 27 studies satisfied the selection criteria and were included in the systematic
literature review equating to a total of 29 comparisons that included 1278 participants (these numbers
include all studies including those excluded from the meta-analysis).
Twelve full-text studies were excluded for the following reasons: studies using a cross-over
design [26]; double-reporting (sub-studies of other RCT) [27,28]; no body weight or composition data
reported [29,30]; interventions not randomized [31,32]; study population outside of age limit [33]; and
multi-component interventions [34–37].
Two studies were not included in the meta-analysis [23,24,38] because the critical data was
not in a form suitable for standardized extraction and the authors did not respond to information
requests. These studies were however included in the qualitative systematic review. Another report
was excluded because it used an extreme dietary intervention of milk as the only food source for
16 weeks [38].
3.2. Characteristics of Included Studies
The characteristics of the RCTs included in the systematic review are summarized in Table 1.
3.2.1. Geographical Location
The majority of trials were conducted in the USA (n = 18) with others conducted in Canada (n = 2),
Australia (n = 2), Mexico (n = 1), UK (n = 1), Iran (n = 1), Japan (n = 1) and Brazil (n = 1).
3.2.2. Study Design
Two studies had intervention periods ě12 months [39,40] while the remaining studies ranged
from 8 to 24 weeks (median duration = 16 weeks (16 weeks for whole dairy food; 8 weeks for dairy
supplement studies)).
3.2.3. Study Populations
Most studies were conducted on participants aged 18–50 years, while a few studies exceeded the upper
range limit (n = 13 studies) (Table 1) Average age across studies was 38 years. Healthy overweight/obese
was the target population for most studies (n = 24) while other studies included overweight/obese

participants with metabolic syndrome (n = 1) or PCOS (n = 1) (See Table 1). Tanaka et al. [41] recruited
Japanese men with ě2 components of the metabolic syndrome of which BMI was one criteria resulting
in a sample with 75% overweight/obese participants. Most studies were conducted in women only or
contained large proportions of women (overall 80% of participants were women). Two studies were
conducted in men only [41,42], while Bowen et al. included a small sub-sample of men [43].

one criteria resulting in a sample with 75% overweight/obese participants. Most studies were 
conducted in women only or contained large proportions of women (overall 80% of participants were 
women). Two studies were conducted in men only [41,42], while Bowen et al. included a small sub‐
sample of men [43].

3.2.4. Interventions 
A total of 21 and 6 studies used dairy foods and dairy supplements, respectively as the 
intervention treatments.  
Dairy foods included daily servings of milk (7 studies), mixed dairy foods including milk, 
yoghurt and cheese (10 studies) and yoghurt only (2 studies). Anderson et al. [24] provided milk‐
based meal replacements (Slimfast™) and Gilbert et al. [20] used a milk supplement with additional 
calcium. Some studies (n = 8) specified the use of low‐fat or skimmed dairy products. Differences in 
the amount of dairy food between dairy and control interventions for most studies ranged from ~2 
to 4 servings/day. In three studies the difference was less than 2 servings/day (0.75 servings/day [44], 
1.3 servings/day [41], 1.8 serving/day [40]. Josse et al. [12] compared multiple dosages of dairy intake 
(low vs. moderate vs. high dairy intake). Most dairy food studies used a low dairy diet as the 
comparison group, while some used isocaloric placebo‐type controls that were either, soy [24,45], rice 
[20], carbohydrate [44] or gelatin‐based [46].  
Dairy supplement intakes ranged from 20 to 84 g/day (average 51 g/day) of either whey fraction 
high in leucine [47] or whey protein isolate [21,42,48,49]. Anderson et al. [23] provided casein protein

3.2.4. Interventions
A total of 21 and 6 studies used dairy foods and dairy supplements, respectively as the
intervention treatments.
Dairy foods included daily servings of milk (7 studies), mixed dairy foods including milk, yoghurt
and cheese (10 studies) and yoghurt only (2 studies). Anderson et al. [24] provided milk-based meal
replacements (Slimfast™) and Gilbert et al. [20] used a milk supplement with additional calcium.
Some studies (n = 8) specified the use of low-fat or skimmed dairy products. Differences in the
amount of dairy food between dairy and control interventions for most studies ranged from ~2 to
4 servings/day. In three studies the difference was less than 2 servings/day (0.75 servings/day [44],
1.3 servings/day [41], 1.8 serving/day [40]. Josse et al. [12] compared multiple dosages of dairy
intake (low vs. moderate vs. high dairy intake). Most dairy food studies used a low dairy diet as
the comparison group, while some used isocaloric placebo-type controls that were either, soy [24,45],
rice [20], carbohydrate [44] or gelatin-based [46].
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 394

Dairy supplement intakes ranged from 20 to 84 g/day (average 51 g/day) of either whey fraction
high in leucine [47] or whey protein isolate [21,42,48,49]. Anderson et al. [23] provided casein protein in the
form of shakes. Dairy supplement studies predominantly used isocaloric placebos of either carbohydrate
(maltodextrin, glucose) [47,49], soy [23] or gelatin-based ([21]. Aldrich et al. [48] was the only supplement
study that used a diet-based control (diet including 1.2 servings of dairy/day + calcium supplements to
balance calcium intake between groups). Longland et al. [42] used skim and whole milk as the supplement
basis with whey and maltodextrin added for dairy and control groups, respectively (See Table 1).
Few studies reported level of compliance to the interventions, although the majority
implemented compliance assessment. Of the studies reporting compliance, >70% compliance was
achieved [20,23,24,41,42,50–54].
3.2.5. Dietary Intakes
Daily intake of protein and calcium at baseline are summarized in Table S1. Few studies reported
dairy intake at baseline, but based on inclusion criteria of ď1 serving/day or reported baseline calcium
intake <600 mg/day, low dairy intake at baseline was presumed for 11 studies [12,22,41,44,45,47,52,54–57]
while high intakes of >1 serving/day were assumed for other studies because of high baseline calcium
intakes reported (>600 mg/day) [20,39,43,50,53]. Several studies, however, did not report dietary
intake at baseline (Table S1).
Most studies reduced energy intake by >2092 kJ/day (>500 kcal/day), while the energy deficit
was less in four studies, ranging from 1046 to 1255 kJ/day (250–300 kcal/day) [22,41,44,50] (Table 1).
Mean daily nutrient composition of the intervention diets are summarized in Table S2. In most
whole dairy food studies dairy servings were incorporated into the diet by replacing certain foods
to match energy and protein intakes across groups, but calcium intakes were generally higher in the
dairy compared to control, groups. For most studies the amount of protein provided by the dairy food
intervention diets were relatively standard (17–22 percentage energy (% E)) and similar between dairy
and control groups [12,20,22,40,41,44,46,52,54–58]. Bowen et al. [43] and Lukaszuk et al. [45] provided
higher protein diets (~32% E and 27% E, respectively), but the protein content was comparable between
dairy and control groups while protein intake was significantly greater than the control groups in the
studies of Hawley et al. [50] (30 vs. 21% E; 1.3 vs. 0.9 g/kg) and Josse et al. [12] (High dairy diet: 28 vs.
16% E; 1.3 vs. 0.7 g/kg).
Dairy supplement interventions provided greater protein intakes compared to control
interventions (Aldrich et al.: 1.46 vs. 0.78 g/kg [48]; Kasim-Karakas et al.: 1.07 vs. 0.61 g/kg [49];
Longland et al.: 2.4 vs. 1.2 g/kg [42]) while protein intakes were low (<1 g/kg) and comparable to
control interventions in the studies by Frestedt et al. [47] and Piccolo et al. [21].
All whole dairy food studies, except Lukaszuk et al. [45], reported calcium intakes that were
greater in the dairy groups compared to the control groups (differences ranged between 141 and
1862 mg/day); the lower end of the range reflecting the smaller difference in dairy servings between
groups in two studies [41,44]. Lukaszuk et al. [45] used a soy milk comparison with added soy protein
to equate the protein content of the two interventions resulting in similar protein and calcium intakes
between groups. Calcium intakes in dairy supplement studies, when reported, were similar between
groups [47,48,59].
Fat intake was similar between groups for most studies; differing by <5% E between dairy and
control groups except for studies by Hawley et al. [50] and Longland et al. [42]. Carbohydrate intake
was similar between groups for most studies except for some where carbohydrate intake was >5% E
greater in the control groups compared to the dairy group [12,45,48–50].
3.2.6. Exercise Regimes
Six studies prescribed resistance training as part of the intervention. Frequency of resistance
training was 2 times/week [12], 3 times/week [22,44,50,53] and 6 times/week [42]. Two studies
included only resistance training [22,44] while others combined it with aerobic training [12,42,50,53] and
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 394
8 of 27
one study included only aerobic training [40]. Exercise regimes were similar between dairy and control
groups. In two studies dairy was consumed proximate to exercise (before and/or after exercise) [42,44].
3.2.7. Outcome Measures
Most studies used dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) to assess body composition and
five studies used bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) [41,45,49,53,55]. DEXA is considered a valid
and precise methodology for assessing changes in body composition while BIA is generally thought to
be less appropriate to assess small changes in body fat [60]. Majority of studies reported lean mass
while three studies reported fat free mass [20,22,45]. Sensitivity analysis showed no impact of body
composition methodology or measurement of fat free mass on the overall results.
Two studies analyzed the data using an intention-to-treat approach [12,51], one study assessed
body weight in participants who complied with the treatments only [40] whereas all other studies
analyzed the data for participants who completed the interventions. Sensitivity analysis showed no
impact of analysis approach on the summary outcomes.
Sensitivity analysis also showed no impact of studies where SD had been imputed on
outcomes [20–22].
3.3. Quality Assessment of Individual Studies
Most studies were of high quality (quality scores ě 8) with only two studies scoring 7 [52,55] and
none < 7 (Table 1). Sensitivity analysis showed no impact of removing studies with a quality scores < 8
on heterogeneity or the overall results.
The quality criteria failed by most studies were randomization method and allocation concealment
mostly due to incomplete reporting. Due to the nature of the interventions most interventions were not
blinded. Confounding factors, not controlled for, most prevalent were potential attrition bias because
attrition and related reasons across groups were not reported by several studies; several studies did not
report nutrient intakes and differences between groups could not be ascertained (Table S3). No conflict
of interest that may have affected study outcomes was apparent in any study.
3.4. Effects of Dairy Intake on Body Weight and Fat Mass during Energy Restriction
Significant differences were seen between the no resistance training vs. resistance training
subgroups for body weight (Chi2 = 6.24, p = 0.01) (Figure 2) with a tendency to differ for fat mass
(Chi2 = 2.98, p = 0.08) (Figure 3). Hence results for these subgroups were reported separately.
3.4.1. Energy Restriction without Resistance Training
A total of 864 participants (744 in dairy food studies; 120 in dairy supplement studies) in
19 comparisons (15 using dairy food; 4 using dairy supplement), from 18 studies (14 dairy food; 4 dairy
supplements) were included in the meta-analysis for body weight change. For the meta-analysis of
body fat mass change, a total of 741 participants (648 in dairy food studies; 93 in dairy supplement
studies) in 16 comparisons (13 using dairy food; 3 using dairy supplement, from 15 studies (12 using
dairy food; 3 using dairy supplements)) were included.
Overall (when dairy food and supplement studies were pooled), increased dairy intake combined
with energy restriction resulted in a significantly greater reduction in body weight (Figure 2) and
body fat mass (Figure 3) compared to control interventions (Body weight: ´0.92 kg [´1.63, ´0.20 kg],
p = 0.01; Body fat mass: ´1.24 kg [´2.10, ´0.37 kg], p < 0.01). Results did not differ between dairy
food and dairy supplement subgroups (Body weight: Chi2 = 0.23, p = 0.63; Body fat mass: Chi2 = 0.84,
p = 0.36). Substantial heterogeneity was seen for body weight (p < 0.001, I2 = 59%) and body fat mass
(p < 0.001, I2 = 74%). One study had significant impact on heterogeneity; excluding Tanaka, 2014 [41]
reduced heterogeneity to acceptable levels for both body weight and body fat mass (p = 0.20, I2 = 21%
and p = 0.08, I2 = 36%, respectively). Although average reduction in body weight and body fat mass
were slightly greater after removal of the Tanaka study, they remained modest (Body weight: ´1.10 kg
[´1.65, ´0.56 kg], p < 0.001; Body fat mass: ´1.41 kg [´2.04, ´0.77 kg], p < 0.001).

Excluding both comparisons conducted only in males (Tanaka, 2014 [41] and Bowen, 2005 [43]),
reduced heterogeneity further (p = 0.32, I2 = 11% and p = 0.26, I2 = 21%, respectively) (Body weight:
´1.16 kg [´1.66, ´0.66 kg], p < 0.001, n = 644; Body fat mass: ´1.49 kg [´2.06, ´0.92 kg], p < 0.001,
n = 521). The average proportion of women in these trials was 90%.
Excluding studies with duration >12 months [39,40] did not affect heterogeneity or outcomes.
Four out of 18 studies were conducted by the same research group, namely Zemel et al. [46,54,56,58].
Removal of the Zemel studies together with Tanaka, 2014 minimally affected the overall result (Body
weight: ´0.91 kg [´1.50, ´0.33 kg], p < 0.01, I2 = 19%; Body fat mass: ´1.07 kg [´1.65, ´0.48 kg],
p < 0.001 I2 = 12%).
The two studies by Anderson, 2005 and 2007 [23,24] (not included in the quantitative meta-analysis
because critical data not available in suitable format) did not show differences in body weight and fat
mass with milk-based or casein-based meal replacements compared to soy-based meal replacements.
However, intervention and control meal replacements were not matched for key nutrients like calcium,
protein and fiber which limit direct comparisons.
Subgroup analysis showed no significant differences in results from studies that specified the
use of low-fat or skimmed dairy products [43,45,46,55–57] compared to those that did not specify the
product type used (Body weight, p = 0.39; Fat mass, p = 0.60).

3.4.2. Energy Restriction with Resistance Training
A total of 307 participants (267 in dairy food studies; 40 in dairy supplement studies) in
7 comparisons (6 using dairy food; 1 using dairy supplement) (from 6 studies (5 using dairy food;
1 using dairy supplements)) were included in the analysis for body weight and body fat mass change
during energy restriction with resistance training.
Energy restricted diets which incorporated a resistance training component did not result in any
difference in changes in body weight (Figure 2) or body fat mass (Figure 3) between the dairy or control
groups (Body weight: 0.36 kg [´0.34, 1.07 kg], p = 0.31, low heterogeneity p = 0.20, I2 = 30%; Body fat
mass: 0.09 kg [´1.20, 1.37 kg], p = 0.90, substantial heterogeneity p < 0.01, I2 = 82%). Only one study
used supplements thus precluding any formal comparison between whole dairy food and supplements.
The Longland, 2016 study [42] was different from other studies with respect to several characteristics;
it was a male-only study (other studies 95% female), it used dairy supplements, and it was the shortest
duration (4 weeks vs. 12–16 weeks). Removing Longland, 2016 did not substantially alter heterogeneity
or overall results. Similarly, removing Thomas, 2011 [44] that used a small dairy serve difference did
not change heterogeneity or overall results.

Body fat mass: 0.09 kg [−1.20, 1.37 kg], p = 0.90, substantial heterogeneity p < 0.01, I2 = 82%). Only one 
study used supplements thus precluding any formal comparison between whole dairy food and 
supplements. The Longland, 2016 study [42] was different from other studies with respect to several 
characteristics; it was a male‐only study (other studies 95% female), it used dairy supplements, and 
it was the shortest duration (4 weeks vs. 12–16 weeks). Removing Longland, 2016 did not 
substantially alter heterogeneity or overall results. Similarly, removing Thomas, 2011 [44] that used 
a small dairy serve difference did not change heterogeneity or overall results.

3.6. Effects of Dairy Dose on Body Composition Outcomes 
Meta‐regression was conducted to examine the study‐level relationship between the differential 
dairy food intake (difference between dairy food intake in the intervention group compared to the 
control group) and mean body weight outcome for those 15 studies conducted without resistance 
training, and using a dairy food intervention. There was no significant univariate relationship 
between differential dairy food intake and body weight outcome (regression coeff −0.28, 95% CI −1.48, 
0.93) (Figure S1). This result was qualitatively unchanged when other co‐variates (mean age, mean 
baseline BMI, study duration, % of female participants) were included in the model (regression coeff 
0.24, 95% CI −1.05, 1.53). Thirteen studies contributed data to the full regression model because mean 
baseline BMI was not available for Zemel et al. [58] and Van Loan et al. [52]. None of the included 
variables in the full model were significantly associated with body weight outcome except for % of 
female participants (regression coefficient −0.04, 95% CI −0.07, −0.01).  
In relation to body fat mass, 13 studies were available which measured difference in change in 
fat mass by dairy food intake without resistance training. There was no significant univariate 
relationship between the dairy food intake contrast (dose difference) and body fat mass outcome in 
these studies (regression coefficient −0.16, 95% CI −1.63, 1.31). After adjustment for other covariates

Meta-regression was conducted to examine the study-level relationship between the differential

training, and using a dairy food intervention. There was no significant univariate relationship between
differential dairy food intake and body weight outcome (regression coeff ´0.28, 95% CI ´1.48, 0.93)
(Figure S1). This result was qualitatively unchanged when other co-variates (mean age, mean baseline

in the full model were significantly associated with body weight outcome except for % of female
participants (regression coefficient ´0.04, 95% CI ´0.07, ´0.01).
In relation to body fat mass, 13 studies were available which measured difference in change in fat
mass by dairy food intake without resistance training. There was no significant univariate relationship
between the dairy food intake contrast (dose difference) and body fat mass outcome in these studies

(regression coefficient ´0.16, 95% CI ´1.63, 1.31). After adjustment for other covariates (mean age,
mean baseline BMI, study duration, % of female participants; n = 11 studies) this result did not change
(regression co-efficient 0.24, 95% CI ´1.76, 2.24).
In examining lean body mass, trials based on differences in whole dairy food intake which
included resistance training were combined with studies that did not include resistance training
in meta-regression (n = 13 studies). In univariate analysis, difference in lean body mass was not
significantly associated with dairy food dose difference used in the studies (regression co-efficient
0.24, 95% CI ´0.13, 0.60). After adjustment for other covariates (mean age, mean baseline BMI, study
duration, % of female participants, whether study included resistance training; n = 13 studies), the
association remained not significant (regression co-efficient 0.10, 95% CI ´0.30, 0.50).
3.7. Publication Bias
Examination of funnel plots indicated moderate asymmetry (lack of smaller trials (trials with
larger SEs) reporting a negative results) suggesting presence of a trend for publication bias in body
weight, fat mass and lean mass (Figure S2).
3.8. Quality of the Total Body of Evidence
Table 2 summarizes the process of rating the quality of the body of evidence according to the
GRADE guidelines and provides a rating that reflects the degree of certainty in the relationship
between dairy intake and body weight or composition.
The degree of certainty that increased intake of dairy products under conditions of energy
restriction without resistance training enhances body weight and body fat mass loss in 18–50-year-old
overweight/obese participants is rated moderate.
This is because the studies were conducted
primarily in women and there is some evidence that trial results are different for men compared
to women. However, when considering the relationship in women (excluding the two male-only
trials, resulting in a sample with an average of 90% women) the degree of certainty was rated as high.
The degree of certainty in the relationship when resistance training was imposed was rated as low to
moderate. This is due to a limited number of studies and substantial inconsistency between studies.
Further research may change the effect estimate and rating. The degree of certainty that increased
intake of dairy will reduce the amount of lean mass lost under conditions of energy restriction was
rated as moderate. The rating was mainly determined by the high degree of inconsistency observed
between studies.

4. Discussion
The findings of this study were that under hypocaloric conditions, a high dairy product
intervention resulted in greater body weight and fat mass loss, and attenuated lean mass loss compared
to control interventions. There was no evidence for a difference in outcome with ‘dose’ of dairy food
with most trials using a contrast of 2 to 3 servings of dairy food a day. These effects were evident
with both dairy foods and dairy supplements. However, under energy restricted conditions with the
inclusion of resistance training, dairy consumption had no additional effects on body weight or fat
mass loss and results for fat mass were inconsistent between studies. As the majority of participants in
individual studies were females further research in males is required to investigate sex effects.
The results are in agreement with recently published meta-analysis showing greater weight and
fat mass loss in the context of energy restriction [9,10] and reduced lean mass loss with dairy intake
compared to control [10]. The current meta-analysis advances this prior research by including two trials
missed in the previous meta-analyses [45,57], including more recently published trials [41,50] and trials
using dairy protein supplements [21,42,47–49] and targeting the specific age group of 18–50 years.
In addition, the current meta-analysis considered the totality of the evidence and rated the degree of
certainty in the relationship between dairy and body weight/composition.
4.1. Energy Restriction without Resistance Training on Body Weight and Fat Mass Loss
Results from studies where dairy products were consumed in conjunction with an energy
restricted diet without resistance training were relatively consistent in showing greater reductions
in body weight and fat mass following dairy intake. The effects were evident with both dairy food
and dairy supplements. The greater body weight loss (~1 kg) over a median period of 16 weeks was
primarily due to greater fat mass loss. Whilst modest, this greater level of weight loss is clinically
relevant. A reduction in body weight of 1 kg was associated with a 16% risk reduction of developing
diabetes in 25–84-year-old overweight/obese participants [62].
One study by Tanaka et al. [41] resulted in high levels of heterogeneity. Removal on this study
reduced heterogeneity from substantial to low levels. Tanaka et al. [41] was different with respect to
several characteristics compared to other studies: it included only men whereas most other studies
included mostly women (mean 80% women); the difference in dairy serves between intervention and
control groups was small (~1.3 serves/day vs. 2+ serves/day in other studies); body composition was
assessed using BIA, a method considered less sensitive to assess small changes in body fat [60]; only
three quarters of the sample was overweight/obese vs. 100% overweight/obese in other studies and it
was the only study conducted in a Japanese population. Variations in some study characteristics may
have affected responses to interventions, albeit only mildly since heterogeneity and overall results
were not affected by these characteristics during sensitivity analysis. Responses in fat mass loss were
smaller and more variable in the two long-term studies (ě12 month) [39,40] and in studies where
participants may have had high dairy or calcium intakes at baseline [20,39,43]. A recent meta-analysis
suggested a calcium threshold of ~600–700 mg/day above which no further benefit of additional intake
on body composition is observed [63]. The pilot study (n = 7) by Lukaszuk et al. used soy-milk with
added leucine as control, resulting in matched intakes of protein and calcium between dairy and control
groups and failed to show additional benefit of dairy consumption on body weight or fat mass loss [45].
Studies were mostly conducted in women (women comprised 80% of the total sample) and
comparisons examining men only [41,43] tended to favor the control treatment. However, the male
sub-group in Bowen, 2005 [43] was very small (n = 10/group) and Tanaka, 2014 [41] differed with
regard to several other characteristics which limits the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the
effects of dairy on body weight and composition in men. Sex differences in body composition changes
in response to weight loss have been suggested [64], but it is unclear why sex may modulate changes
in body weight and composition in response to dairy consumption. Further research is needed to
investigate the effect of dairy consumption on body weight and composition changes in men.
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 394

The protein component of dairy is a candidate for an important role in its effects on body weight
and fat mass loss, possibly related to the greater thermic effects of protein [65,66]. This is supported by
the three dairy (or whey) protein supplement studies that showed benefits for body weight and fat
mass loss [47–49]. All three studies reported higher dietary protein intake compared to the control
groups (1.07 vs. 0.61 g/kg [49]; 1.46 vs. 0.78 g/kg [48] and 0.81 vs. 0.61 g/kg [47]). Moreover,
findings from Frestedt et al. indicate that even small increases in protein intake of just 0.2 g/kg
using whey fraction high in leucine can have beneficial effects for groups who may not otherwise
be meeting their RDA for protein [47]. A pilot study where dairy milk was compared to soy milk
(protein and calcium content matched between interventions) did not have any additional weight loss
effects [45]. The meta-analysis by Wycherley et al. [8] further supports a role for protein by showing
modest benefits of high-protein diets from different sources in conjunction with energy-restricted
diets for reducing body weight (´0.79 kg [´1.50, ´0.08 kg]) and fat mass (´0.87 kg [´1.26, ´0.48 kg]).
Further accumulating evidence suggests that dairy protein, particularly whey protein, may affect
body weight through regulation of food intake and appetite [4]. Indeed, Gilbert showed that milk
supplementation induced a smaller increase in desire to eat and hunger, suggesting attenuation of
weight loss-related increase in appetite [20]. However, in the context of prescribed energy restriction
used in the studies examined, where food and energy intake is strictly controlled therefore not
allowing for ad libitum feeding, the appetite regulating mechanism may be less operative. From the
current evidence it is not possible to ascertain whether the effects of dairy interventions were directly
attributable to dairy protein or to increased intake of total dietary protein.
It is also possible the high calcium content of dairy may have contributed to the weight and
fat mass reducing effects. Dairy food intervention groups, where the differences in dairy serves
were >2 servings/day, consumed ~582–1862 mg/day more calcium compared to control groups
while protein intake in most of these studies were held constant. Using a mixed-model regression
analysis including 18 observational studies that examined dietary calcium (with the majority of dietary
calcium derived from dairy products), Dougkas et al. [4] showed that an increased calcium intake
from 400 to 1200 mg/day was associated with a reduction in body mass index (BMI) from 25.6
to 24.7 kg/m2. The most cited mechanism for the effect of calcium on weight loss, demonstrated in
cell-culture and animal studies, involves the influence that ingested calcium has on intracellular calcium
and subsequently adipocyte lipid metabolism by reducing de novo lipogenesis and increasing fat
oxidation. However, studies in humans have failed to support this hypothesis [4]. Alternatively, a more
plausible mechanism may be that high dairy calcium increases faecal fat excretion. A meta-analysis
by Chirstensen et al. [2] indicated that dairy calcium consumption of 1241 mg increased faecal fat
excretion by 5.2 g/day (CI 1.6, 8.8 g/day) compared with low dairy calcium intake (<700 mg/day).
The authors estimated that this level of fat excretion would translate into 1.9 kg body fat or 2.2 kg body
weight loss over a year. As noted by Dougkas et al. [4], other investigators have suggested that the
impact of calcium on fat absorption may be protein dependent suggesting that the impact of calcium
from dairy may be greater than supplemental calcium.
Furthermore, dairy is a rich source of MCT, C8:0 (caprylic acid) and C10:0 (capric acid), which have
been shown to increase energy expenditure, lipid oxidation and satiety [67]. A recent meta-analysis
showed dosages ranging from 2 to 54 g/day produced small reductions in body weight (´0.51 kg
[´0.80, ´0.23 kg]) compared to long-chain triacylglycerols over study periods of 1–4 months [68].
Dairy is also a source of the fatty acid CLA, which has been shown to affect body weight and fat
mass. The meta-analysis by Onakpoya et al. [69] showed small reductions in body weight (´0.70 kg
[´1.09, ´0.32 kg]) and fat mass (´1.33 kg [´1.79, ´0.86 kg]) with dosages ranging from 2.4 to 6 g/day
over an average period of 8 months. MCT and CLA may therefore contribute to weight reducing
effects, but it is unlikely that the small amounts of these fatty acids in dairy will have measurable
weight reducing effects. Three servings of dairy/day would supply ~1 g C8:0 + C10:0 (RMIT fatty
acid database, FoodWorks, 2009, Xyris Software, Kenmore Hills, Queensland, Australia) and ~0.1 g
CLA [70] while the amounts will be negligible in low-fat/skimmed dairy products. Several other dairy
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 394
21 of 27
constituents such as lactose, protein and their peptide derivatives may also affect body weight through
the regulation of food intake and appetite although there is a paucity of evidence from well-designed
intervention studies that closely controlled energy intake to confirm the mechanisms [4].
4.2. Energy Restriction with Resistance Training on Body Weight and Fat Mass Loss
In contrast to the studies examining energy restricted diets without resistance training, the
small number of comparisons (n = 7) that included a resistance training component to the energy
restricted diets did not reveal any beneficial effects of dairy on body weight or fat mass. Substantial
heterogeneity was seen between studies for fat mass explained by inconsistent findings, with some
studies favoring dairy intake [12,42], some favoring control treatment [22,53] and others showing no
effect [12,44,50]. It is possible the potent effects of combined energy restriction and resistance training
may have maximized the weight and fat loss effects that precluded any further modest influence
of dairy from being observed. Greater intakes of dairy, providing greater amounts of protein and
calcium, may be required in conjunction with resistance training to have a measurable effect on
body fat mass. Comparisons that showed greater body fat mass loss provided high dosages of dairy
resulting in considerably greater intakes of protein [12,42] and calcium [12] compared to the control
groups. Josse et al. [12] showed a dose response effect with significant greater fat mass loss in the
high dairy compared to the low dairy groups (6 servings/day difference) whereas the difference was
not significant between the medium and low dairy groups (3 servings/day difference). Protein and
calcium intake in the high compared to the low dairy groups were significantly greater (protein: 28 vs.
16% E, 1.3 vs. 0.72 g/kg; calcium: 1840 vs. 299 mg/day) [12] whereas protein intake was comparable
between moderate and low dairy groups (18 vs. 16% E; 0.84 vs. 0.72 g/kg). Longland et al. [42]
provided whey protein isolate to achieve protein intakes of 2.4 g/kg/day vs. 1.2 g/kg/day in the
control group. Furthermore, high baseline intakes of calcium (>700 mg/day) in some studies [50,53]
may have counteracted any additional body weight or fat mass loss [63].
The degree of certainty in the relationship between dairy intake and body weight/fat mass when
resistance training was imposed was rated as low to moderate due to limited number of studies
and substantial heterogeneity between studies. Hence, before any conclusion can be made further
research is required to determine the role of dairy on body weight/fat mass in conjunction with energy
restriction and resistance training.
4.3. Attenuation of Loss in Lean Mass
Incorporation of dairy within an energy restricted diet attenuated the loss of lean mass compared
to control interventions. Whole dairy and particularly the whey protein component of dairy has
a high leucine content which is a key essential amino acid for triggering muscle protein synthesis [71].
The reduction in loss of lean mass was modest, 0.36 kg [0.01, 0.71 kg], which likely explains why
most individual studies could not demonstrate a significant effect while the pooled result of the
meta-analysis showed significant effects likely due to enhanced statistical power. Despite the relatively
modest effect size, lean mass loss was reduced by about ~75% which may have clinical relevance for
regulating resting energy expenditure, protein metabolism and postprandial glucose uptake [8].
These results were observed despite most studies prescribing standard amounts of protein
(within recommended intake ranges) and similar protein intakes between dairy and control groups.
However, the greatest effects of dairy on lean mass were observed in studies where protein intake
was higher in the dairy groups (>~1.2 g/kg/day) compared to control groups (<~1.2 g/kg/day) and
energy restriction was combined with resistance training [12,42,50]. Although, the independent effects
of dairy protein on lean mass cannot be ascertained from this systematic literature review, whey
protein has been shown to be more effective at preserving muscle protein synthesis compared to soy
protein [72]. Whey protein supplementation attenuated the decline in postprandial rates of muscle
protein synthesis after weight loss compared to soy protein or a carbohydrate control [72]. Furthermore,
acute mechanistic studies have demonstrated that following resistance exercise training, whey protein
induced a superior muscle protein synthesis response compared to casein, soy or carbohydrate [3,73].
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 394
22 of 27
Further studies incorporating a control group consuming a different type of protein, e.g., soy protein is
needed to determine whether the effects on lean mass are attributable specifically to dairy protein or
dietary protein intake in general. Due to the high degree of heterogeneity observed between studies
the overall quality of the evidence for the relationship between dairy intake and lean mass under
conditions of energy restriction was rated as moderate.
4.4. Dose
Across studies conducted under hypocaloric conditions dose of dairy food did not show
a linear relationship with mean body weight or composition change differences between dairy and
control groups. Improvements in body weight and composition were seen with dairy food differences
ranging from 2 to 4 servings/day. However, meta-regression of RCTs is prone to confounding due to
differences between trials, the range of dose differences was small, background intake of dairy food was
often not stated, nor compliance with required intake. Ideally dose-response would be investigated
in specifically designed trials. Josse et al. [12] showed greater fat mass reductions and lean mass
increases with 6–7 servings of dairy food (milk, cheese, yoghurt)/day compared to 3 servings/day
and 0–1 servings/day under conditions of energy restriction with resistance training for 16 weeks.
The absence of a detectable dose-response effect may detract from inferring a causal relationship
between dairy consumption and body weight and composition changes. On the other hand, the lack of
a dose-response effect may suggest a threshold amount of dairy that is required to promote favorable
body composition changes above which no further benefit is attained. Onakpoya et al. [63], from their
meta-analysis, suggested a calcium threshold of ~600–700 mg/day (~2 servings of dairy) above which
no further benefit of additional intake of calcium on body composition is observed.
4.5. Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of this systematic literature review include strict adherence to the Cochrane systematic
review guidelines; acquisition of a sizeable and comprehensive study data-set for meta-analysis
through contacting authors or estimating mean changes and SDs for missing data (only data from 2 out
of 27 studies were not in a suitable form for inclusion in the meta-analysis); conducting dose-response
analysis; considering the totality of the evidence by rating the degree of certainty in the relationship
between dairy and body weight/composition using GRADE guidelines; and conducting a priori
sub-group analyses and extensive sensitivity analyses to identify potential causes of inconsistencies
between studies. Most studies included were of high quality and inclusion of studies that examined
both dairy foods and supplements provides a comprehensive understanding of the effects of dairy
intake on body weight and composition. Restriction of the review to younger adults may have
improved homogeneity, but limits generalizability for older individuals. Other limitations were the
finding that studies were largely of women, hence the results cannot be readily generalized to men;
the effects of different dairy sources could not be distinguished, e.g., H milk vs. cheese vs. yoghurt
because different dairy sources were typically not compared within studies; some a priori sub-group
analysis could not be performed (i.e., effects of study duration and sex differences) due to a limited
number of studies with differentiating characteristics; the impact of habitual dietary intakes could
often not be assessed because they were not reported; and few studies reported compliance to the
desired interventions. Furthermore, a high degree of heterogeneity was seen between studies for
the relationship between dairy intake and lean mass which could not be explained; and a trend for
publication bias was identified.
5. Conclusions
The evidence shows modest benefits for dairy product consumption (ě2 servings of dairy
food/day or on average 55 g whey protein/day) on body weight and composition (fat mass loss and
lean mass loss attenuation) over a median period of 16 weeks in the context of energy restricted diets
in overweight and obese adults aged 18–50 years. The degree of certainty in the relationship between
 Nutrients 2016, 8, 394
23 of 27
dairy intake and body weight and fat mass under conditions of energy restriction in 18–50-year-old
women was rated as high. Due to considerable heterogeneity the relationship between dairy intake
and lean mass was rated as moderate. In studies that imposed resistance training the degree of
certainty rating for body weight and body fat mass outcomes were low to moderate due to substantial
heterogeneity and limited number of studies; hence requiring further investigation. Since the majority
of participants examined were females, further research in males is required to investigate sex effects.

Acknowledgments: We would like to thank librarians Andrea Smith and Darren Jones, CSIRO for executing
the database literature searches and Paul Foster, dietitian, CSIRO, Adelaide for his hard work, dedication and
perseverance in the identification of studies, data extractions and quality appraisal of studies. The research was
partly funded by the Dairy Health and Nutrition Consortium.
Author Contributions: W.S., T.W., N.L.-M., G.B., M.R. designed the systematic literature review; P.T. managed the
identification of studies and extraction of data; W.S. performed the meta-analysis; M.R. performed meta-regression;
W.S. synthesized the data, performed GRADING of the evidence and was the main author of the paper while all
authors critically revised the paper and approved the final version.
Conflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest. The research was undertaken as part of a larger
research project investigating the role of dairy for the management of healthy body composition. The research
was sponsored by the Dairy Health and Nutrition Consortium through a grant that was awarded in a competitive
tender process. The current manuscript has been updated from a section of the larger research report. The sponsor
had no role in the decision to publish, the choice of journal or in the writing of the manuscript.
