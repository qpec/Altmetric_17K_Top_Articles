Cranberry-derived 
proanthocyanidins impair  
virulence and inhibit quorum 
sensing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Vimal B. Maisuria1, Yossef Lopez-de Los Santos2, Nathalie Tufenkji1 & Eric Déziel2
Bacteria have evolved multiple strategies for causing infections that include producing virulence 
factors, undertaking motility, developing biofilms, and invading host cells. N-acylhomoserine lactone 
(AHL)-mediated quorum sensing (QS) tightly regulates the expression of multiple virulence factors 
in the opportunistic pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, inhibiting QS could lead 
to health benefits. In this study, we demonstrate an anti-virulence activity of a cranberry extract rich 
in proanthocyanidins (cerPAC) against P. aeruginosa in the model host Drosophila melanogaster and 
show this is mediated by QS interference. cerPAC reduced the production of QS-regulated virulence 
determinants and protected D. melanogaster from fatal infection by P. aeruginosa PA14. Quantification 
of AHL production using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry confirmed that cerPAC effectively 
reduced the level of AHLs produced by the bacteria. Furthermore, monitoring QS signaling gene 
expression revealed that AHL synthases LasI/RhlI and QS transcriptional regulators LasR/RhlR genes 
were inhibited and antagonized, respectively, by cerPAC. Molecular docking studies suggest that 
cranberry-derived proanthocyanidin binds to QS transcriptional regulators, mainly interacting with 
their ligand binding sites. These findings provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of action 
of a cerPAC to restrict the virulence of P. aeruginosa and can have implications in the development of 
alternative approaches to control infections.
As antibiotic resistance in microbial pathogens embodies a global threat to public health, it demands the devel-
opment of novel strategies for managing microbial infections. The long-term effectiveness of most antibiotic 
treatments is restricted by both pathogen drug resistance and non-target effects on the host’s commensal micro-
bial community. Over the last decade, research on antimicrobials has shifted towards an alternative approach to 
combat pathogens using anti-infective drugs that selectively interrupt virulence pathways to help prevent or cure 
bacterial infections. Anti-infective drugs that do not perturb survival or viability of bacterial pathogens should be 
less likely to promote resistance than conventional antibiotics1,2. Until now, the development of anti-infective syn-
thetic drugs has been limited to the laboratory and preclinical studies2–4. Natural bioactive compounds derived 
from plant species show promising therapeutic properties to combat the emerging resistance in microbial patho-
gens, which can be exploited as next generation anti-infective drugs.
The fruit of the American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon L.) has been anecdotally reported as a natural 
remedy for urinary tract infections for centuries5,6. Accordingly, a growing number of studies have examined the 
potential anti-oxidant7, anti-adhesion8–11, anti-motility12–17 and anti-cancer18,19 properties of cranberry-derived 
compounds. A number of these studies focused on the bioactivity of a specific fraction of cranberry phyto-
chemicals known as proanthocyanidins (cPACs). Research shows that these condensed tannins hinder bacterial 
attachment to cellular or biomaterial surfaces8,11,20, impair motility of the pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis12–17, and can induce a state of iron limitation in uropathogenic E. coli21. 
O’May et al.15 also reported that a different cranberry derived material, namely, cranberry powder derived from 
whole, crushed cranberries, impairs the surface-associated swarming motility of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 while 
enhancing biofilm formation. Also, cPACs block invasion of intestinal pathogens as a result of rearrangement of

host cell cytoskeleton in vitro20. While many studies have suggested that consumption of cranberry-derived mate-
rials, namely cranberry capsules and cranberry juice, is effective in preventing bacterial infections22–26, few have 
looked at the effects of these cranberry-derived materials in vitro and in vivo after consumption24,27,28. Indeed, the 
effect of bioactive cPACs on bacterial virulence in vivo and mechanisms by which they do so are poorly under-
stood. To date, not much attention has been given to the anti-virulence properties of cPACs.
P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic and versatile γ-proteobacterium that readily develops antibiotic resist-
ance and is responsible for various infections affecting immunocompromised individuals, such as those suf-
fering from cystic fibrosis29–31. P. aeruginosa regulates most of its virulence factors in a cell density-dependent 
manner via cell-to-cell communication, commonly known as quorum sensing (QS)32. P. aeruginosa has two 
major N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL)-based QS pathways, the Las and Rhl QS systems, and one 2-alkyl-4-
(1H)-quinolone (AQ)-based QS system, which function in a cascade manner33,34. The Las system is positioned 
at the top of the QS hierarchy and uses N-3-(oxo-dodecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12-HSL) as its 
signal molecule, and involves LasI and LasR as the synthase and regulator, respectively35,36. The Rhl system uses 
N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL) as its signal, and involves RhlI and RhlR as the synthase and regula-
tor, respectively35,36. The LasR initiates the QS regulatory systems, partially activates the transcription of RhlR and 
other regulators of Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) and integrated quorum sensing (IQS) systems33,37. The 
complex QS regulation network influences, both positively and negatively, the transcription of possibly 5–10% 
genes of P. aeruginosa38,39. The QS system is an essential part of the organism’s virulence and is required to estab-
lish infection in the mammalian host40.
Bacterial QS is considered an attractive therapeutic target in efforts to diminish bacterial virulence by reduc-
ing the level of QS signals, or by interfering with other QS system targets41,42. Several attempts were made to find 
suitable candidate molecules with anti-QS and anti-biofilm activity against P. aeruginosa43. Experimental and 
modeling studies suggest that evolution and spread of resistance in bacteria against QS inhibiting compounds 
may be occurring44,45. Thus, the identification of new compounds aimed at inhibiting bacterial QS will mitigate 
the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens.
The goal of this study was to examine the anti-virulence potential of a cranberry extract rich in proanthocy-
anidins (cerPAC) in combating the opportunistic human pathogen P. aeruginosa. Our results clearly show the 
anti-infectious properties of a cerPAC against P. aeruginosa strain PA14 and reveal the multi-modal action of 
cerPAC in impairing QS function.
Results
A cranberry extract rich in proanthocyanidins inhibits P. aeruginosa virulence towards D. 
 
melanogaster. 
Treatment with cerPAC significantly inhibited the staphylolytic (LasA, F3,8 = 
 21.41, p < 
 0.001), 
elastolytic (LasB, F3,8 = 
 84.29, p < 
 0.001) and alkaline proteolytic (AprA, F3,8 = 
 34.41, p < 
 0.001) activities of P. 
aeruginosa PA14 (Fig. 1a). Importantly, this inhibition was achieved without affecting bacterial growth (Fig. 1b).
Next, to verify whether cerPAC can limit infection in vivo, we used a fruit fly killing assay in which we admin-
istered cerPAC to Drosophila melanogaster infected with WT P. aeruginosa PA14. As shown in Fig. 2, the median 
survival of D. melanogaster after exposure to P. aeruginosa was 168 h without cerPAC, but 240 h with cerPAC 
treatment, which is significantly (χ2 = 
 4.14, df = 
 1, p < 
 0.05) less virulence based on the comparison of survival 
curves. The survival of uninfected D. melanogaster was identical to the treatment with only cerPAC.

The difference in the treated or untreated PA14 strains’ ability to kill D. melanogaster in this feeding assay may 
have been due to modified survival of the bacteria on the filter papers used for exposure during incubation. To 
address this possibility, we analyzed the survival of PA14 on the paper discs without and with 200 μ 
g mL−1 cerPAC 
under the same conditions as the fly feeding assay. There was no significant difference (F5,30 = 
 0.54, p = 
 0.74) in 
culturability of the bacterium on the filter paper discs in the absence and presence of cerPAC during incubation 
(see Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating that an alteration in survival ability of bacteria could not account for the 
observed differences in fly killing. Overall, these results indicate that cerPAC protect D. melanogaster from P. 
aeruginosa infection.
Cranberry extract rich in proanthocyanidins modulates the AHL-mediated quorum sensing 
system in P. aeruginosa PA14. 
Since QS regulates multiple virulence determinants in P. aeruginosa, we 
hypothesized that cerPAC contain molecule(s) that might interfere with QS in P. aeruginosa PA14. Therefore, to 
determine the ability of cerPAC to modulate the production of the two principal AHL molecules by P. aeruginosa 
PA14, we determined AHL production kinetics in absence or presence of 200 μ 
g mL−1 cerPAC. As shown in 
Fig, 3A,B, cerPAC significantly impairs the production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL (t = 
 7.45, df = 
 4, p < 
 0.001) and C4-HSL 
(t = 
 3.54, df = 
 4, p < 
 0.05), in P. aeruginosa PA14 at exponential and late stationary phase, respectively. This reduc-
tion in the production of the QS signals was observed without affecting bacterial growth (Fig. 3C).
To understand the mechanism for the reduction in AHL levels, β-galactosidase transcriptional fusion report-
ers of lasI (3-oxo-C12-HSL synthase) and rhlI (C4-HSL synthase) were assayed in P. aeruginosa PA14 bioreporter 
strain with the same 200 μ 
g mL−1 cerPAC exposure. These bioassays revealed that expression of both AHL syn-
thase genes (lasI and rhlI) is repressed by cerPAC (Fig. 4A,B). Similarly, we also investigated whether presence of 
cerPAC affects the expression of the two cognate transcriptional regulator genes lasR and rhlR using lacZ tran-
scriptional fusion reporters. Expression of both regulator gene fusions was partially repressed in the presence of 
cerPAC (Fig. 4C,D). Thus, cerPAC inhibits both AHL synthases and partially represses the LuxR-type regulator 
genes associated with the production of the two AHL signals in P. aeruginosa PA14.
Cranberry extract rich in proanthocyanidins act as an antagonist of AHL-mediated quorum 
sensing in P. aeruginosa PA14. 
Considering that AHLs act as autoinducing ligands of LasR and RhlR, 
we hypothesized that cerPAC component(s) interfere with LasR/RhlR activation by AHLs. We thus investigated 
whether cerPAC affects LasR and/or RhlR induction by exogenous AHLs using bioreporter AHL-negative PA14 
mutants with lacZ fusions. As expected, when 3-oxo-C12-AHL or C4-HSL were supplied to their respective biore-
porters, they activated the expression of lasI and rhlI, respectively (Fig. 5A,B). While cerPAC had no effect on 
the activity of the reporters, there was a significant (p < 
 0.05) reduced activation by either AHLs in presence of 
cerPAC (Fig. 5A,B). This indicates that cerPAC partially inhibits the activation of both LasR- and RhlR-directed 
transcription of lasI and rhlI, respectively, the primary targets of these LuxR-type regulators. Additionally, LasR 
and RhlR activation titration was performed in absence and presence of three different concentrations of cerPAC, 
which resulted in lower activation of LasR and RhlR (Fig. 5C,D). This indicates that cerPAC can reduce the acti-
vation of both regulators by their native AHLs, likely as a potential antagonist.
Cranberry extract rich in proanthocyanidins inhibits LasR activity without binding to AHL mol-
ecules and also interact with LasI. 
To assess a possible physical interaction between cerPAC components 
and either AHL molecule, we quantified C4-HSL and 3-oxo-C12-HSL in cell-free growth medium using an ethyl 
acetate extraction procedure followed by LC-MS analysis. If the cerPAC binds to the AHLs, we would expect to

observe a reduction in AHL concentration due to compromised extraction. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2, 
there was no difference in the concentration of AHLs with or without cerPAC, demonstrating that cerPAC com-
ponents do not bind to the AHLs and therefore do not inhibit QS by physical interaction.
Inhibition of Las-type QS regulators’ activities by cerPAC may be due to structural interactions, important for 
the functional activity of transcriptional regulatory proteins. To address this possibility, in silico docking analysis 
was performed using protein structures of LasR (2UV046), LasI (1RO547), the monomer and dimer of epicatechin 
molecules (important components of cPACs48). To test our docking method, we compared the interaction energy 
scores (obtained using Moldock tools) of the predicted docking complex and the known crystallographic complex 
structures of the LasR with ligand 3-oxo-C12-HSL. The Moldock interaction energy score of − 
144.1 kcal mol−1 for 
the predicted complex of LasR with 3-oxo-C12-HSL was marginally lower than the Moldock interaction energy 
score of − 
157.5 kcal mol−1 obtained for the crystallographic complex of LasR with ligand 3-oxo-C12-HSL (Fig. 6a 
and see Supplementary Table S1). The epicatecin and its dimer (proanthocyanidin) molecules were docked sep-
arately in the internal cavity of LasR (Fig. 6b,c). Ligand binding domain (LBD) of LasR with a volume of 653 Å3, 
exhibits sufficient space to accommodate the monomer or dimer of epicatechin with a volume of 225 Å3 or 466 Å3, 
respectively. The in silico docking analysis suggests that the complex formation between the epicatechin and LasR, 
with a Moldock interaction energy score of − 
127.1 kcal mol−1, is more favorable than LasR-proanthocyanidin 
complex with Moldock score of − 
68 kcal mol−1 (see Supplementary Table S1). The proanthocyanidin formed 
six hydrogen bonds at the internal binding cavity of LasR compared to four hydrogen bonds of the LasR-
3-oxo-C12-HSL or LasR-epicatechin complex (Fig. 6). The increase in the Moldock score for the docking complex 
of LasR with proanthocyanidin compared to LasR-epicatechin complex was observed due to the steric constraints 
of the proanthocyanidin structure in the internal cavity space of LasR identified by the comparison of their inter-
nal energies (see Supplementary Table S1).

Due to the lack of crystallographic structure of LasI protein bound with its natural substrates or func-
tional analogues, we performed in silico docking analysis to predict a complex of LasI with its natural substrate 
S-adenosyl L methionine (SAM) (Fig. 7a). This putative complex with LasI was used as a reference for both 
docking analyses of epicatechin and proanthocyanidin. The best five structural positions of SAM with higher 
interaction energies occupied the same binding cavity on the LasI protein. The docking analysis showed the for-
mation of hydrogen bonds of SAM with residues that surround the putative binding cavity with Moldock inter-
action energy score of − 
126.2 kcal mol−1 (Fig. 7a and see Supplementary Table S1). The binding cavity known 
for the second substrate of LasI, the acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) was not identified as a potential binding 
site for either of the tested cerPAC components (epicatechin or proanthocyanidin). The LasI-epicatechin com-
plex showed single hydrogen bond with Moldock interaction energy score of − 
106.8 kcal mol−1 (Fig. 7b and 
see Supplementary Table S1). The docking complex of the LasI protein with the proanthocyanidin molecule 
suggests the more favorable complex formation with five hydrogen bonds and Moldock interaction energy score 
of − 
153.6 kcal mol−1 compared to the LasI-SAM complex (Fig. 7c). This in silico docking analysis suggests that 
both main components of cerPAC have the potential to form complexes with LasR and LasI proteins to compete 
with their native ligands 3-oxo-C12-HSL and SAM, respectively.
Cranberry extract rich in proanthocyanidins impairs AHL production in other pathogenic 
strains. 
According to our data, cerPAC can act as a general QS inhibitor by interfering with the binding of 
the AHL ligand to LuxR-type transcriptional regulators. To verify that cerPAC is able to impede QS in other 
bacterial species, we performed an AHL production kinetics assay to examine the effect of administering cer-
PAC to wild type strains of Burkholderia ambifaria and Chromobacterium violaceum. The addition of cerPAC to 
growth medium significantly impairs the production of the two main AHLs (C8-HSL and C6-HSL) in B. ambifaria 
(Fig. 8A) and C6-HSL in C. violaceum (Fig. 8B). Since the primary target of LuxR regulators are luxI homologues, 
these observations validate the capacity of cerPAC to interfere with AHL-mediated QS in different bacterial 
species.

Discussion
The identification of selective anti-virulence therapies that abolish the production of virulence determinants 
without affecting the viability of pathogenic bacteria would be extremely useful in combating bacterial infections 
caused by broad-spectrum antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The search for QS inhibitors or quenchers is a prom-
ising strategy aimed at development of innovative anti-microbial strategy to attenuate the virulence of infectious 
bacteria. Here, we showed that a cranberry extract enriched in PACs restricts virulence of P. aeruginosa in a fruit 
fly animal model and inhibits QS mechanisms. In addition, the cerPAC does not perturb cell viability of P. aerugi-
nosa, indicating that use of these molecules may provide less selective pressure towards the development of resist-
ance than conventional antibiotics (bactericidal and bacteriostatic, which pose strong selective pressure in any 
environment45). However, it would be naive to presume that QS inhibition is unlikely to put any selective pres-
sures on pathogenic bacteria that may lead to resistance against QS inhibition, as quite a few studies suggest the 
possibility of resistance development against QS inhibition44,45. Nonetheless, it is important to continue to expand 
our strategies for combating pathogen resistance by identifying novel anti-microbial and anti-virulence agents49. 
Our findings have elucidated the likely mechanisms of action behind the anti-virulence efficacy of cerPAC: 1) it 
reduces the production of AHL signaling molecules; 2) it represses the expression of the QS regulators LasR and 
RhlR and autoinducer synthases LasI and RhlI; 3) it antagonizes the activation of LasR and RhlR by their cognate 
autoinducers; and 4) epicatechin and proanthocyanidin, the main components of cerPAC, are modeled in silico 
to interact with the LBD of LasR and LasI. In addition, cerPAC also inhibits AHL production in strains of the 
Gram-negative species B. ambifaria and C. violaceum. Thus, cerPAC could have anti-virulence activity against 
various pathogens with clinical importance.
For in vivo study, we used a fly feeding assay which represents a long-term infection model and involves feed-
ing starved flies with bacterial cultures. This method is better adapted to chronic infections compared to the fly 
nicking model50. A dose of cerPAC was supplied at the start of infection and virulence was subsequently reduced, 
indicating that a cranberry extract enriched in PACs could function as a prophylactic. These results, when con-
sidered with other literature, indicate that the use of effective prophylactic molecules with anti-virulence activity, 
specifically for P. aeruginosa, could be a best practice in the clinical setting51. It is noteworthy that the extract used 
herein contains approximately 95% proanthocyanidins, and thus, it is presumed that the bioactivity observed 
can be mostly attributed to these molecules. Nonetheless, there is also a possibility that other, as yet unidentified 
molecules present in the cranberry extract, also act as potent quorum sensing inhibitors. Additional studies con-
ducted with fractionated cranberry extracts are needed to achieve more insights into the bioactivity of specific 
fractions of cranberry derivatives.
That a cerPAC alone inhibits QS has not been previously reported in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. 
An earlier study reported the impairment of QS in P. aeruginosa in the presence of a commercial cranberry juice 
cocktail52; however, the mechanisms of action of this complex mixture of molecules was not identified. We tar-
geted Las and Rhl QS systems because they are at the top of the P. aeruginosa quorum sensing hierarchy33. Both 
AHL molecules induce their own production and activate the corresponding LuxR-type transcriptional regula-
tors LasR and RhlR36,53. In the presence of the cranberry extract, we observed impairment in AHL production, 
along with reduced gene expression of AHL synthase (LasI and RhlI) and partial repression of their regulators 
(LasR and RhlR). Similar observations have been made using other QS inhibitor molecules51,54–56. Interestingly, 
we found that cerPAC, a potent in vivo inhibitor, is an effective antagonist of both LasR and RhlR, two regulators 
that act reciprocally on key virulence determinants33,51,57. We propose that anti-virulence efficacy of the cerPAC is 
essentially due to its interference with the LasIR and RhlIR-dependent QS regulatory circuitry, though we cannot 
exclude a multifactorial effect.
Previous studies have identified anti-QS and anti-biofilm candidate molecules effective against P. aerugi-
nosa17,43,44,58. Among them, plant-derived natural flavonoid and phenolic compounds are commonly studied for 
the inhibition of P. aeruginosa biofilm17,43 and QS43. The structure of a typical PAC is tetrameric in nature, com-
posed of epicatechin units with one A-type linkage48. Catechin, an epimer of epicatechin, inhibits biofilm forma-
tion and QS-controlled virulence factors59. Consequently, other structurally-similar flavonols, such as baicalein60, 
naringenin61 and quercetin55, are also anti-QS and anti-biofilm compounds. Thus, we docked monomer and 
dimer (proanthocyanidin) of epicatechin molecule onto LasR and LasI proteins to assess the specific interaction. 
Our hypothesis was that these molecules would bind to LasR and LasI, occupying the crucial LBD, which would 
result in inhibition of P. aeruginosa QS systems. The successful molecular docking of epicatechin or proanthocy-
anidin with LasR suggested that the inactivation of transcriptional regulators may be the primary mechanism of 
action for the cerPAC as anti-virulence factors in vivo.
Our results show that a cerPAC protects D. melanogaster from P. aeruginosa likely through an inhibition of 
QS without negative effect on bacterial growth. Antagonist activity and in silico analysis projected the potential 
mechanism of action to the inhibition of AHL regulators. As hopeful as these anti-virulence strategies are, they 
emerge with a new set of preclinical and regulatory development challenges. It remains to be verified whether 
plant-derived compounds cause significant side-effects in animals or humans. However, one can also conceive of 
important clinical application for treatment of acute and chronic infections caused by P. aeruginosa and poten-
tially other bacterial pathogens, as our preliminary data suggest cerPAC is a general inhibitor of AHL-mediated 
QS. Taken together, our results present a promising case for cerPACs as efficient QS inhibitors for the regulation 
of bacterial pathogenicity.

lasR65 and rhlR53 as well as wild type strains Burkholderia ambifaria HSJ166, Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 
31532 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. Plasmids carrying lacZ fusion with genes lasI (pSC1167, tran-
scriptional fusion; pME385368, translational fusion), lasR (pPCS100136, transcriptional fusion), rhlI (pMW30569, 
transcriptional fusion; pME384668, translational fusion) and rhlR (pPCS100236, transcriptional fusion) were 
introduced into appropriate P. aeruginosa PA14 QS mutant strains by electroporation, as described previously53. 
All bacterial strains were preserved in glycerol stock (15% v/v) culture at − 
80 °C and cultured in Tryptone Soy 
Broth (TSB) medium, with antibiotics if required for plasmid maintenance: tetracycline (75 mg L−1), carbenicillin 
(300 mg L−1), gentamicin (100 mg L−1), streptomycin (250 mg L−1) and spectinomycin (250 mg L−1).
Phenotypic assay. 
To assess LasB elastolytic activity53,70, filter-sterilized culture supernatant samples 
(100 μ 
L) from late stationary phase cultures of strain PA14 were mixed with 5 mg elastin Congo red reagent 
(Sigma-Aldrich) and 300 μ 
L 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.2). Release of Congo red from degraded elastin was measured 
as A495 after 2 h of incubation at 37 °C with shaking at 100 rpm, followed by centrifugation. For assessment of 
LasA staphylolytic activity53, 5 ml of S. aureus ATCC 25923 overnight cultures were boiled for 15 min, and 100 μ 
l 
were mixed with 300 μ 
l of filtered culture supernatants of PA14. The OD600 was measured after 2 h of incubation 
at 37 °C and 100 rpm. To analyze alkaline protease (AprA) activity71, filter-sterilized culture supernatant samples 
(200 μ 
L) from late stationary phase cultures of PA14 were vortexed with 25 mg of Hide–Remazol Brilliant Blue R 
powder (Sigma-Aldrich) in 800 μ 
L of 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM CaCl2. The tube was then 
incubated at 37 °C at 150 rpm for 1 h. The insoluble hide azure blue was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × 
 g 
for 4 min at 4 °C and the absorption of the supernatant was measured at 595 nm. All experiments were carried 
out in triplicate.
Infection of Drosophila melanogaster. 
Fruit flies (D. melanogaster) were infected orally in fly feeding 
assay as before50,72, with some modifications. Briefly, flies were anesthetized under a gentle stream of carbon diox-
ide. Male flies (3- to 5-days-old) were starved of food and water for 5–6 h and separated into vials (10 per vial) 
 
containing 5 ml of 5% sucrose agar (sterile) without and with 200 μ 
g mL−1 cerPAC and 2.3-cm filter paper disks 
(sterile) containing freshly grown bacterial culture suspension. To achieve this freshly grown culture, an over-
night PA14 culture was inoculated in 6 mL TSB culture and incubated at 37 °C and 100 rpm until OD600 = 
 3.0. 
This culture was centrifuged at 12,000× 
 g for 1 min and the resulting pellet resuspended in 150 μ 
L of sterile 5% 
sucrose, without and with 200 μ 
g mL−1 cerPAC. All filters were soaked appropriately with this culture suspension, 
along with sucrose agar, in feeding vials prior to transferring flies into the vial. Separate feeding vials soaked with 
150 μ 
L of 5% sucrose without and with 200 μ 
g mL−1 cerPAC were used as negative controls for each experiment. 
Post-infection mortality of flies was monitored daily for 14 days, with each treatment tested twice in triplicate.
LC-MS analyses. 
Specific estimation of AHL molecules was achieved by LC-MS in the positive electrospray 
ionization (ESI+ 
) mode, combined with the MRM mode, as described previously64,65,73.
Samples of PA14 culture exposed to cerPAC were retrieved at different time points and OD600 was measured. 
An aliquot of methanolic internal standard was mixed with each sample to adjust final concentration 3 mg L−1 
of 5,6,7,8-tetradeutero-4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (HHQ-d4) and 6 mg L−1 of 5,6,7,8-tetradeutero-3,4-dihyd
roxy-2-heptylquinoline (PQS-d4)73. All culture samples were vortex-mixed and extracted twice with ethyl acetate 
(1:1, vol:vol), each ethyl acetate extract pooled and evaporated at 30 °C under a gentle stream of nitrogen. The 
residue was then resuspended in acidified acetonitrile (HPLC grade, containing 1% ACS grade acetic acid) at 
ten times the initial concentration and 20 μ 
L aliquots were injected for LC-MS analysis73 (more details are in 
Supplementary Information).
β-galactosidase assay for LacZ expression. 
β-galactosidase activity was measured as described by 
Miller74, with slight modifications as reported previously53. Briefly, cells were grown in TSB without and with cer-
PAC to various cell densities. Samples of cell culture were retrieved at different time points and diluted in Z-buffer 
(Na2HPO4 0.06 M; NaH2PO4 0.04 M; KCl 0.01 M; MgSO4.7H2O 0.001 M; β 
-mercaptoethanol 0.05 M; pH 7.0). 
 
Cells in Z-buffer were permeabilized by the addition of one drop of 0.1% SDS and two drops of chloroform. 
Then, 200 μ 
L of 4 mg mL−1 ONPG was added to each reaction mixture, and enzyme reaction was stopped using 
200 μL of 1 M Na2CO3. Cell debris were separated by centrifugation at 14,000× 
 g for 30 sec and color development 
was monitored at 420 nm. β 
-galactosidase activity was expressed in Miller units (MU), calculated as follows: 
1,000 × OD420/T (min) × V (mL) × OD600.
Antagonists/agonists assay. 
To evaluate the activity of cerPAC as antagonists/agonists against the natural 
AHL ligand of LasR or RhlR, 3-oxo-C12-HSL (Sigma-Aldrich) and C4-HSL (Cayman Chemical) were used as 
inducers in this assay. The AHL-deficient strain that has been engineered to produce β 
-galactosidase upon activa-
tion of LasR by 3-oxo-C12-HSL [∆ 
lasI (lasI-lacZ; pME3853)] and RhlR by C4-HSL [∆ 
rhlI (rhI-lacZ; pME3846)], 
were grown overnight in TSB medium. The overnight culture was diluted in fresh TSB and was grown to achieve 
an OD600 = 
 0.3. An appropriate amount of sterilized cerPAC stock solution prepared in MilliQ water was added 
to sterile culture tube containing TSB. For control condition, either 3-oxo-C12-HSL or C4-HSL (stock solu-
tion in DMSO as a control) was added to sterile culture tube containing TSB, final DMSO concentration (after 
addition of cells) did not exceed 0.5% v/v. Bacterial cells were added to TSB (final OD600 = 
 0.05) without and 
with cerPAC approximately 30 min prior to the addition of the AHL at a final concentration of 3.13–50 nM (for 
3-oxo-C12-HSL) or 62.5–1000 nM (for C4-HSL), to achieve final volume of 2 mL. Culture tubes were incubated 
at 37 °C for 3 h under shaking at 200 rpm, measurement of cell OD600 and β 
-galactosidase assay were performed

at the regular time intervals after 3 h of incubation. The concentration of cerPAC that reduced or increased the 
β 
-galactosidase activity compared to controls containing 3-oxo-C12-HSL or C4-HSL (without cerPAC) was con-
sidered to determine antagonist or agonist activity.
In silico docking analysis. 
To understand the interaction between components of the cerPAC with LasR and 
LasI protein structures, we performed virtual docking using the Piecewise Linear Potential and Lennard-Jones 
algorithms that can identify steric and hydrogen bonding interactions, and the Coulomb potential for electro-
static forces. In silico docking analysis was performed using the Molegro Virtual Docker 6.0 suite without the 
incorporation of water molecules. To maintain the search robustness, twenty rounds of iteration were used for 
each docking process. The S-adenosyl L methionine (NCBI Pubchem CID 34756) and the 3-oxo-C12-HSL (NCBI 
Pubchem CID 127864) molecular structures were used as native ligand molecules, for the LasI (RCSB Protein 
data base ID 1RO547) and LasR (RCSB Protein data base ID 2UV0) proteins, respectively. The components of cer-
PAC, epicatechin (NCBI PubChem CID 182232) and proanthocyanidin (NCBI PubChem CID 108065) molecu-
lar structures were used as ligands in virtual docking for both proteins. The MolDock search tool75, that combines 
guided differential evolution and a cavity prediction algorithm was used for docking scores (in kcal mol−1) based 
on the interaction energies of each complex. The best five positions with high Moldock interaction energies were 
sampled and compared in every complex computed. The Computed Atlas of Surface Topography76 of proteins 
was used to explore the volumes of the cavities in the target proteins (http://sts.bioe.uic.edu/castp/index.php). The 
molecular graphics and analyses were performed using the UCSF Chimera version 1.177.
Statistical analysis. 
All experiments were repeated in quadruplicate, unless otherwise specified. Fruit fly 
survival curves were prepared using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) to perform a 
statistical Log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test. Data represented are the means of replicates and the differences among 
the control, and results were analyzed by using one way or two way ANOVA as required.
