C
lostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common
cause of diarrhea in the hospital and is responsible for
an estimated 27 000 deaths annually in the United
States.1 Clostridium difficile infection occurs when there is a
susceptiblehostandsufficientexposuretotheorganism.Many
factors may increase host susceptibility to CDI, but the most
crucial host-related risk factor is exposure to antibiotics.2
Antibiotics are a risk factor for CDI not only when they are as-
sessed at the level of the individual patient but also when they
are assessed at the level of the hospital ward,3,4 the level of the
institution,5 and the regional level.6
Exposure to C difficile is common in the hospital because
C difficile spores are capable of persisting in the environment
for months.7 High counts of C difficile spores can be detected
in the stool of infected or colonized individuals, and C diffi-
cile can be readily cultured from the beds, bed rails, floors,
and walls of hospital rooms where prior occupants have had
CDI.8,9 When individuals enter a new environment, they
rapidly acquire C difficile as well as the other microorgan-
isms that are present.10 When one hospital roommate has
CDI, patients who share that room are at increased risk for
CDI.11 Furthermore, when the previous occupant of a given
hospital room has CDI, the subsequent patient in that room
is at increased risk for CDI.12
It is uncertain how antibiotics or other CDI risk factors
might act on one patient to increase risk for CDI in a subse-
quent patient who shares the same hospital environment. We
examined whether receipt of antibiotics by prior occupants of
OBJECTIVE To assess whether receipt of antibiotics by prior hospital bed occupants is
associated with increased risk for CDI in subsequent patients who occupy the same bed.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This is a retrospective cohort study of adult patients
hospitalized in any 1 of 4 facilities between 2010 and 2015. Patients were excluded if they had
recent CDI, developed CDI within 48 hours of admission, had inadequate follow-up time, or if
their prior bed occupant was in the bed for less than 24 hours.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary exposure was receipt of non-CDI antibiotics by
the prior bed occupant and the primary outcome was incident CDI in the subsequent patient
to occupy the same bed. Incident CDI was defined as a positive result from a stool polymerase
chain reaction for the C difficile toxin B gene followed by treatment for CDI. Demographics,
comorbidities, laboratory data, and medication exposures are reported.
RESULTS Among 100 615 pairs of patients who sequentially occupied a given hospital bed,
there were 576 pairs (0.57%) in which subsequent patients developed CDI. Receipt of
antibiotics in prior patients was significantly associated with incident CDI in subsequent
patients (log-rank P < .01). This relationship remained unchanged after adjusting for factors
known to influence risk for CDI including receipt of antibiotics by the subsequent patient
(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02-1.45) and also after excluding 1497 patient
pairs among whom the prior patients developed CDI (aHR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.43). Aside
from antibiotics, no other factors related to the prior bed occupants were associated with
increased risk for CDI in subsequent patients.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Receipt of antibiotics by prior bed occupants was associated
with increased risk for CDI in subsequent patients. Antibiotics can directly affect risk for CDI in
patients who do not themselves receive antibiotics.

Clostridium difficile Infection
Clostridium difficile infection was defined as a positive result
from a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for the C difficile
toxin B gene from an unformed stool followed by receipt of ap-
propriate anti-CDI antibiotics. We selected 2010 for the start
of the study because it represents the earliest time when all
participating institutions uniformly used the stool PCR test for
the diagnosis of CDI. For the duration of the study, the envi-
ronmental policies related to CDI at the participating institu-
tions met or exceeded current guidelines from the Society for
Healthcare Epidemiology of America and the Infectious Dis-
eases Society of America.13 These policies are summarized in
eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Primary Exposure
Theprimaryexposurewasreceiptofantibioticsbythepriorbed
occupant during the relevant hospitalization, prior to dis-
charge from the shared bed. Receipt of antibiotics was as-
sessedusingdatafromacomputerizedclinicianorderentrysys-
tem. To ensure that antibiotics did not function as a surrogate
for suspected but undiagnosed CDI, patients were not classi-
fied as having received antibiotics if the only antibiotics they
received were those specifically used for treatment of CDI (ie,
metronidazole or oral vancomycin). The antibiotic classes
included in the study are listed in eTable 2 in the Supplement.
Antibiotic exposure was classified categorically as present vs
absent because the best evidence suggests that even a single
dose of antibiotics affects risk for CDI for up to 90 days.14-16
Covariates
Automated queries were used to retrieve demographic infor-
mation, laboratory values at the time of room admission, co-
morbidities using claims data (to compute the Charlson
Comorbidity Index),17,18 duration of hospital stay, the presence
or absence of contemporaneous cases of hospital-onset CDI (to
capture the concept of C difficile colonization pressure),3 ward
type(classifiedascardiac,medical,surgical,neurological,orin-
tensive care unit), and treatments received during hospitaliza-
tion including receipt of antibiotics, hemodialysis, acid sup-
pression medications (proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2
receptorantagonists),andimmunosuppressivemedications(in-
cluding systemic steroids at a minimum dose of 5 mg of pred-
nisone or equivalent, calcineurin inhibitors, antimetabolites,
anti–tumor necrosis factor agents, and mycophenolate).
Statistical Approach

Hodges-Lehmannestimate.Categoricalvariableswerecompared
usingtheχ2testorFisherexacttestwhen5orfewereventswere

structed using a Cox proportional hazards model with patients
followed from the time of room admission until discharge,
death, CDI, or for a maximum of 14 days. We selected 14 days as
a cutoff because (1) this represents the period of maximum CDI
risk following antibiotics,19 (2) most patients who develop
new CDI colonization do so within the first 14 days following
hospitalization,9 and (3) the prior bed occupant’

Key Points
Question Is the receipt of antibiotics by prior hospital bed
occupants associated with risk for Clostridium difficile infection
(CDI) in subsequent patients who occupy the same bed?
Findings In this cohort study, receipt of antibiotics by prior
patients was associated with a 22% relative increase in risk for CDI
in subsequent patients who occupied the same bed. Aside from
antibiotics, no other factors related to the prior bed occupants
were associated with increased risk for CDI in subsequent patients.
Meaning Antibiotics given to one patient may alter the local
microenvironment to influence a different patient’
s risk for CDI.
Importance Antibiotics are the crucial risk factor for CDI, but it is
unknown how one hospitalized patient’
s receipt of antibiotics may
affect risk for CDI for a different patient within the same
environment.

Results
Patient Characteristics
Data for a total of 100 615 pairs of patients sequentially admit-
ted to a given hospital bed were analyzed, including 576 subse-
quent patients who developed CDI within 2 to 14 days after ar-
riving at their bed. There was no evidence of CDI outbreaks or
of a change in the incidence rate of CDI during the course of the
study(eFigure2intheSupplement).Themediandurationofbed
occupancy for the prior bed occupant was 3.0 days (interquar-
tilerange[IQR],1.9-5.4).Therewasamediandurationof10hours
(IQR, 4-29) during which the bed was vacant between patients.
When the subsequent patient developed CDI, the median time
from bed admission to CDI was 6.4 days (IQR, 4.0-9.5).

were also more likely to have prior bed occupants with simi-
lar traditional CDI risk factors.
Multivariable Analysis
The cumulative incidence of CDI in subsequent patients was
0.72% when prior bed occupants received antibiotics com-
pared with 0.43% when prior bed occupants did not receive
antibiotics (log-rank P < .01) (Figure 1). In the final Cox pro-
portional hazards model, receipt of antibiotics was the only
characteristic related to prior patients that was associated
with increased risk for CDI in subsequent patients (Table 3).
The most important risk factors for CDI were all related to
the subsequent patient: receipt of antibiotics, the presence
of a contemporaneous patient with CDI on the ward, receipt
of acid suppression medications, and hospitalization in
the ICU.

Sensitivity Analyses
The relationship between receipt of antibiotics by prior
patients and risk for CDI in subsequent patients remained
unchanged when the analysis was restricted by excluding
1497 patient pairs in which the prior patient had recent CDI
(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.43). When
season was tested in the final model, there was a significant
increase in risk for CDI during the summer compared with
the winter months (aHR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09-1.74), although
this did not alter the relationship between prior patients’
receipt of antibiotics and risk for CDI in subsequent patients
(aHR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.43). We observed that an intensive
care unit (ICU) location was a significant independent risk
factor for CDI. Stratifying by ICU vs non-ICU locations,
the association between prior patients’receipt of antibiotics
and risk for CDI in subsequent patients was stronger in
the ICU (aHR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.05-2.36) compared with
non-ICU locations (aHR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.96-1.43),
although this interaction was not statistically significant
(P = .19).
Discussion
In pairs of patients sequentially admitted to a given hospital
bed, receipt of antibiotics by prior bed occupants was associ-
ated with increased risk for CDI in subsequent patients. This
association was modest in strength but remained statistically
significant after adjusting for potential confounders such as
patient comorbidities, CDI colonization pressure, ward type,
and the subsequent patient’
s exposure to antibiotics. This as-
sociation was independent of the prior bed occupant’
s CDI sta-
tus, and persisted through multiple sensitivity analyses. We
examined several traditional risk factors for CDI in the prior
patient, including antibiotics, hemodialysis, acid suppres-
sion medications, and immunosuppressants. Of these risk fac-
tors, only receipt of antibiotics by prior bed occupants was as-
sociated with increased risk for CDI in subsequent patients.
These findings are summarized graphically in Figure 2.
Antibiotics have long been established as the crucial risk
factor for CDI. Previous studies have shown that use of

antibiotics has an impact on individual risk for CDI when
use of antibiotics is evaluated at the ward level, or even
at the broader level of the hospital or the regional
network.3-6,22 Our study may be the most direct example to
date of the potential effect of antibiotics in patients who do
not themselves receive the antibiotics. In patients colonized
by C difficile, antibiotics may promote C difficile prolifera-
tion and the number of C difficile spores that are shed into
the local environment.23 In turn, this may result in a higher
environmental burden of C difficile and greater risk for
acquisition and infection in future patients who share the
same environment. Alternatively, antibiotics may affect the
gastrointestinal microbiome more globally to decrease bac-
terial species that are protective against C difficile or to
increase bacterial species that facilitate C difficile.24 Subse-
quent patient-to-patient transmission of these bacterial spe-
cies may then drive risk for CDI in future patients. The spe-
cific mechanisms underlying the herd effects of antibiotics
may be a fruitful area for future research.
Several studies have examined how individual patient-
to-patient networks affect risk for CDI. In patients who are co-
housed, a roommate with CDI is a risk factor for incident
CDI.9,11,25 Physical proximity to a patient with known CDI also
seems to be a risk factor.26,27 Shaughnessy et al12 studied ICU
admissions and found a 3-fold increase in risk for CDI when
the prior room occupant had CDI. Studies focused on the ac-
quisition of multidrug-resistant organisms have reached simi-
lar conclusions.28-30 More generally, the CDI status of prior
room occupants can be considered as a component of the colo-
nization pressure related to C difficile. The concept of coloni-
zationpressure—essentiallythenumberofpatientsnearbywho
already have the infection—is well established for carriage of
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-
resistant Enterococcus and also for CDI.3,31 Our study results
extend the findings of these previous studies by demonstrat-
ing that the CDI risk profile of the prior bed occupant (ie,
whether or not that patient received antibiotics) is likely to be
a part of C difficile colonization pressure.
During the period of our study, all participating institu-
tions had policies that met or exceeded current environmen-
tal cleaning protocols for CDI. However, the presence of a
policy does not necessarily mean that the policy is being
effectively implemented.32,33 Clostridium difficile spores are
hardy, are not killed by gastric acid, and are ubiquitous in
the hospital environment and easily cultured from patient
beds and other locations.9,34 As the burden of C difficile
spores increases, it is likely to be increasingly difficult to pre-
vent the spread of spores to patients by hospital personnel or
by other vectors.35-38 Many institutions, including the insti-
tutions that participated in this study, currently target the
rooms of patients with CDI for additional cleaning measures,
such as UV radiation.39 Our study provides further, albeit
indirect, evidence of the importance of colonized patients in
the nosocomial transmission of C difficile.40,41 Overall rates
of CDI may be improved by focusing cleaning protocols on
the rooms of patients who have risk factors for CDI (eg,
receipt of antibiotics) rather than focusing exclusively on
patients with known CDI. In this study, CDI in prior bed
occupants was not a risk factor for CDI in subsequent
patients. This may indicate that the beds and rooms of
patients with known CDI are cleaned more effectively than
other beds and rooms.
This study was observational and, as with all observa-
tional studies, the potential for confounding should be care-
fully assessed. Selective housing of patients—that is, the
housing of the sickest patients in certain rooms—must be
considered as a source for residual confounding. Because
baseline severity of illness is an important risk factor for
CDI, selective housing of patients could cause bias away
from the null. Several pieces of evidence argue against this
as an explanation for our results. First, adjusting for patient
comorbidities did not significantly alter the relationship
between the antibiotics received by prior bed occupants and
subsequent patients’ risk for CDI. Second, if the sickest
patients were housed in certain rooms one would expect to
see an association between traditional risk factors for CDI
(eg, serum creatinine or albumin levels) in the prior patient
and the subsequent patient’
s risk for CDI. However, aside
from antibiotics, no other factors related to the prior patient
were associated with CDI in the subsequent patient in our
final model. Finally, the strength of association increased
when we examined only patients housed in the ICU, where
patients are likely to be more homogeneous and preferential
admission of sicker patients to certain rooms is unlikely.

There are additional limitations to this study. It was
conducted in a single health care system and may not be
generalizable to other institutions. The study was also con-
ducted in a nonoutbreak setting, and the relationship
between antibiotics and CDI may fundamentally differ dur-
ing an outbreak. Because we analyzed data that were previ-
ously collected, we were not able to directly assess the
mechanism by which C difficile may be transmitted from
prior bed occupants to subsequent patients. We were not
able to demonstrate a dose-response effect. Last, the
observed effect size was small. Although this translates into
a modest absolute risk associated with antibiotics in the
prior bed occupant, it remains important because use of
antibiotics in the hospital is so common. Our results show
that antibiotics can potentially cause harm to patients who
do not themselves receive the antibiotics and thus empha-
size the value of antibiotic stewardship.
Conclusions
In this large cohort study, receipt of antibiotics by prior occu-
pantsofagivenhospitalbedwasassociatedwithincreasedrisk
for CDI in subsequent patients hospitalized in the same bed.
This finding remained true after excluding patient pairs in
which the prior bed occupant had known CDI. The increase in
risk was small but is of potential importance given the fre-
quency of use of antibiotics in the hospital. These data imply
that patient-to-patient transmission of C difficile or other bac-
teria that mediate susceptibility to CDI takes place in the non-
outbreak setting and in the face of a multifaceted effort seek-
ingtopreventhealthcare–associatedCDI.Moregenerally,these
data support the hypothesis that antibiotics given to one pa-
tient may alter the local microenvironment to influence a
different patient’
s risk for CDI.
