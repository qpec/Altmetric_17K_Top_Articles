GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT
Background: Allergy immunotherapy targets the
immunological cause of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and allergic
asthma and has the potential to alter the natural course of
allergic disease.
Objective: The primary objective was to investigate the effect of
the SQ grass sublingual immunotherapy tablet compared with
placebo on the risk of developing asthma.
Methods: A total of 812 children (5-12 years), with a clinically
relevant history of grass pollen allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and
no medical history or signs of asthma, were included in the
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, comprising
3 years of treatment and 2 years of follow-up.
Results: There was no difference in time to onset of asthma,
defined by prespecified asthma criteria relying on documented
reversible impairment of lung function (primary endpoint).
Treatment with the SQ grass sublingual immunotherapy tablet
significantly reduced the risk of experiencing asthma symptoms
or using asthma medication at the end of trial (odds
ratio 5 0.66, P < .036), during the 2-year posttreatment
follow-up, and during the entire 5-year trial period.
Also, grass allergic rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms were 22% to
30% reduced (P <.005 for all 5 years). At the end of the trial, the
use of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis pharmacotherapy was
significantly less (27% relative difference to placebo, P < .001).

 Total IgE, grass pollen–specific IgE, and skin prick test
reactivity to grass pollen were all reduced compared to placebo.
Conclusions: Treatment with the SQ grass sublingual
immunotherapy tablet reduced the risk of experiencing asthma
symptoms and using asthma medication, and had a positive,
long-term clinical effect on rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms and
medication use but did not show an effect on the time to onset of
asthma. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2018;141:529-38.)

Asthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide
and is considered a serious global health problem affecting all age
groups.1,2 It is among the most frequent chronic diseases in
childhood3 and imposes a considerable burden on patients, their
families, and health care systems. Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis
(ARC) is a recognized risk factor for asthma development.4-6
Allergy immunotherapy (AIT) targets the immunologic cause
of upper and lower respiratory IgE-mediated allergic symptoms
by modulating the immunological response to allergen exposure.
In addition to reducing ARC symptoms and the need for allergy
pharmacotherapy, AIT has shown potential to alter the natural
course and to prevent the progression of the allergic disease in
children.7,8 AIT treatment could therefore represent an attractive
modality for the prevention of the development of asthma, as an
added benefit in addition to the established effect on ARC. Results
from a limited number of open trials with a low number of
subjects included, suggest that AIT can reduce the risk of
developing asthma symptoms in subjects with ARC.9-13 The
Grazax Asthma Prevention (GAP) trial is the first to evaluate
this effect of AIT in a large, randomized, double-blind, and
placebo-controlled trial.
The SQ grass sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) tablet
(GRAZAX 75,000 SQ-T/2,800 BAU, ALK, Hørsholm, Denmark)
is
a
rapid-dissolving
tablet-based
allergy
immunotherapy
product.
The objective of the GAP trial was to investigate the effect of 3
consecutive years of treatment with the SQ grass SLIT tablet
compared with placebo on the risk of developing asthma (defined
by the fulfilment of a set of specific, predefined asthma diagnosis
criteria) in children with grass pollen ARC but no existing signs or
symptoms of asthma. The effect was investigated throughout the
trial, which comprised a screening period, a 3-year treatment
period, and a 2-year follow-up period. In addition, the asthma
status at the end of trial was assessed. The trial also assessed
the impact on ARC symptoms and medication use and
immunological markers. The trial is the largest pediatric AIT
trial conducted to date and is the first large, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial assessing prevention of asthma in a
pediatric population. The results of the trial could potentially
impact the medical purpose of the SQ grass SLIT tablet.
METHODS
The
trial
was
a
1:1
randomized,
parallel-group,
double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial, designed and conducted in accordance with the
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki14 and in compliance with the Good
Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization
(ICH).15 Relevant national ethics committees and regulatory authorities
approved the trial protocol and amendments.
The
trial
(EudraCT:
2009-011235-12,
NCT:
NCT01061203)
was
conducted at 101 sites in 11 European countries and included 812 children.16
Eligible children were 5 to 12 years old at randomization with a positive skin
prick test (SPT) response (wheal diameter >
_3 mm) and specific IgE to Phleum
pratense (>
_IgE class 2; >
_0.70 kU/L); grass ARC requiring allergy
pharmacotherapy
during
2
grass
pollen
seasons
(GPSs)
prior
to
randomization; and no medical history of asthma and/or wheezing and no
signs of asthma within the last 2 years or since the fifth birthday. Written
informed consent was obtained from parents/guardians of the participants.
Randomization was performed by the sponsor in blocks of 6, using the SAS
system for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Randomized treatment
assignment was stratified for trial site. The trial was an add-on trial, where
all children, in addition to the investigational medicinal product, were
offered allergy and asthma pharmacotherapy. Children randomized to both
placebo and AIT received relevant pharmacotherapy during the 5-year trial
period.17,18
The grass SLIT tablet contains Phleum pratense grass pollen allergen
extract and is formulated as a rapidly dissolving oral lyophilisate for
sublingual
administration.
The
daily
dose
is
1
tablet
for
at-home
administration, except first intake, which is to be administered under medical
supervision. The placebo intervention was tablets identical to the grass SLIT
tablets but without pollen extract.
The trial comprised a screening period, a 3-year treatment period, and a
2-year follow-up period (see Fig E1 in this article’s Online Repository at
www.jacionline.org). Details of the trial design16 are found in the Methods
section in the Online Repository (available at www.jacionline.org).
To
evaluate whether asthma
developed
since the previous visit,
the
following
were
assessed
at
each
trial
visit:
Asthma
physical
examination—child presenting at the visit with present wheezing during
normal breathing or presenting with prolonged phase of forced exhalation.
Assessment of asthma medical history in the period since the last visit, which
included presence of the following asthma symptoms: (1) wheezing, (2) cough
lasting for more than 10 consecutive days, (3) shortness of breath, and (4) chest
tightness. In addition, the children were asked whether they had used any
asthma medication to treat respiratory or pulmonary symptoms since the last
visit. Asthma medications included: b2-agonists, systemic corticosteroid,
inhaled
corticosteroids,
leukotriene
receptor
antagonists,
long-acting
b2-agonist, sustained-release theophylline, and cromolyn sodium. Assessment
of lung function (FEV1 reversibility).
The primary endpoint was time to onset of asthma measured in days from
randomization. Asthma was defined as the fulfillment of 1 or more of the
following 3 criteria, which were evaluated at each trial visit for each time period
‘‘since last visit’’: (1) At least 1 episode of wheeze, cough, shortness of breath or
chest tightness, and a change in FEV1 >
_12% after b2-agonist administration.

 (2) Wheezing with or without prolonged phase of forced exhalation observed at
physical examination and an intake of asthma medication, which resulted in a
clinically relevant effect. (3) Wheezing with or without prolonged phase of
forced exhalation observed at physical examination and a change in FEV1
>
_12% after b2-agonist administration. According to the trial protocol, the onset
of asthma was considered a binary event (asthma yes/no) that only could occur
once per subject. Thus, the children were only classified as having asthma if the
criteria were met at a single given visit, and clinical information from previous
or subsequent visits was not taken into consideration when this classification
was made. Children with frequent reporting of asthma symptoms but no observ-
able reversible impairment of lung function at trial visits were not classified as
having asthma. Likewise reclassification was not done if a child, once classified
as having asthma, reported no asthma symptoms or asthma medication use at
subsequent visits.
Asthma symptom and asthma medication status at end of trial (in the period
from winter visit in year 5 to GPS visit in year 5) was a predefined secondary
asthma endpoint. The proportion of children with asthma symptoms and/or
asthma medication use during the course of the trial was further characterized
post hoc and analyzed for the entire trial and the follow-up period. In addition,
the number of children needed to treat (NNT) to prevent 1 additional child
from having asthma symptoms and using asthma medication was analyzed
post hoc for the 2-year follow-up period.
Secondary rhinoconjunctivitis endpoints included visual analog scale
(VAS) score of ARC symptoms (yearly at the GPS visit), VAS score of
ARC symptoms (daily for 2 weeks prior to GPS visit in year 5), ARC
medication score (daily for 2 weeks prior to GPS visit in year 5), and
immunology (IgE and IgG4). Safety assessments included recording of
adverse events (AEs), events of special interest (including discontinuations
due to AEs), serious AEs (SAEs) (according to ICH Harmonized Tripartite
Guideline E2A, Step 5)19 and physical examinations. AEs were coded using
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (ICH) version 18.0.
The statistical software used was SAS version 9.4 and R version 3.2.2
(R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). Details of the sample size calculation and
statistical methodology are provided in the Methods section in the Online
Repository. All statistical analyses were carried out by the sponsor.
RESULTS
Subject disposition is shown in Fig 1. The total analysis set
included 1192 children. Of these, 380 (32%) were screening
failures. The full analysis set (FAS) (and the identical safety
analysis set) included 812 randomized children; 414 on placebo
and 398 on the SQ grass SLIT tablet. Of all randomized children,
608 children (75%) completed the trial. There was no overall
difference in discontinuations between treatment groups but a
higher proportion of children discontinued due to AEs in the
active group (n 5 39) compared with in the placebo group
(n 5 13). No children were excluded from the analysis data sets.
The treatment groups were similar with regard to baseline
demographics (see Table E1 in this article’s Online Repository at
www.jacinonline.org).
The primary efficacy analysis of time to onset of asthma as
defined by the prespecified asthma diagnosis criteria showed no
difference between SQ grass SLIT tablet and placebo (Table I).
Seventy-three children fulfilled the asthma diagnosis criteria, but
some of these children had no signs or symptoms of asthma at
the subsequent visits during the 2-year follow-up period. Of the
73 children fulfilling the criteria, 51 reported asthma symptoms
or use of asthma medication during the 2-year follow-up period,
and only 43 of those (29 children on placebo and 14 children on
SQ grass SLIT tablet) reported both asthma symptoms and asthma
medication use during that period. Of the 739 children not
diagnosed with asthma according to protocol criteria, 147 children
reported asthma symptoms or use of asthma medication during the
2-year follow-up period, and 66 of those children (41 children on
placebo and 25 children on SQ grass SLIT tablet) reported both
asthma symptoms and medication use during that period.
The predefined efficacy analysis of asthma symptom and
medication status at the end of the trial (assessed at GPS visit in
year 5) showed that fewer children on SQ grassSLIT tablet treatment
compared with placebo-treated children experienced asthma symp-
toms or used asthma medication; odds ratio (OR) 5 0.66; P 5.036,
corresponding to a relative risk reduction of 29.4% (Table I).
The proportion of children experiencing asthma symptoms or
using asthma medication was further characterized post hoc each
year of the 5-year trial period. The OR for experiencing asthma
symptoms or using asthma medication on SQ grass SLIT tablet
versus placebo treatment was in favor of the SQ grass SLIT
tablet each year, with statistical significance (P value < .05)
from year 2 onward (see Fig E2 in this article’s Online Repository
at www.jacionline.org); the corresponding relative risk reductions
ranged from 36.2% to 50.7%.
When the analysis was repeated for the winter visits alone or
the GPS visits alone (Fig 2), the pattern was similar, with

 differences in favor of SQ grass SLIT tablet treatment. Thus, the
treatment effect was year round. The difference between the 2
treatment groups became more pronounced with time.
The treatment effect on asthma symptoms (see Fig E3 in this
article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org) was primarily
due to a reduction in wheeze, chest tightness, and shortness of
breath. The treatment effect on asthma medication use (see Fig
E4 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org)
was primarily due to a reduction in b2-agonist use.
Children treated with the SQ grass SLIT tablet also had a
reduced risk of experiencing asthma symptoms and/or using
asthma medication when longer time periods were analyzed. This
was the case both when assessing the entire 5-year trial period
(asthma symptoms: OR 5 0.71, P 5 .025; asthma medication:
OR 5 0.72, P 5 .047; asthma symptoms and asthma medication
use: OR 5 0.67, P 5 .028) and even more pronounced when
assessing the 2-year follow-up period (asthma symptoms:
OR 5 0.55, P 5 .017; asthma medication: OR 5 0.34,
P 5 .002; asthma symptoms and asthma medication use:
OR 5 0.28, P 5 .0004, relative risk reduction of 71%) (Fig 3).
The SQ grass SLIT tablet reduced the proportion of children
experiencing asthma symptoms and/or using asthma medication
during the follow-up period. Also, when including documented
FEV1 reversibility >
_12% in the clinical characterization of the
children, the proportion fulfilling the criteria was lower when
treated with the SQ grass SLIT tablet than with placebo
(P 5 .028) (Fig 4).
The NNT to prevent 1 additional child in having asthma
symptoms, using asthma medication as well as having both
asthma symptoms and asthma medication use during the 2-year
follow-up was analyzed. For asthma symptoms, NNT 5 12; for
asthma medication use, NNT 5 11; and for both asthma

visits (A) and summer visits (B).

 symptoms and asthma medication use, NNT 5 10. The treatment
effect (OR for SQ grass SLIT tablet vs placebo) was independent
of age. However, younger children had a higher predicted
probability of developing asthma symptoms and using asthma
medication than older children had. Thus, the younger the
children were at treatment start, the greater the percentage was
prevented from having asthma symptoms and using asthma
medication during the follow-up period. Consequently, the
NNT to prevent 1 additional child from having asthma symptoms
and asthma medication use during the 2-year follow-up period
increased with age, with NNT 5 6 for children 5 years of age and
NNT 5 20 for children 12 years of age (see Table E2 in this
article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).
The ARC symptoms were evaluated yearly at the GPS visits by
individual rating on a VAS of how the children had perceived their
symptoms during the preceding week. The VAS score was
evaluated on a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 100 mm (severe
symptoms). For all 3 treatment years and the 2 follow-up years,
the adjusted mean for the ARC VAS score was statistically
significantly lower (ie, lower severity of symptoms) in the SQ
grass SLIT tablet group compared with the placebo group
(relative differences of 22% to 30%) (Table II).
In addition to the yearly rating on a VAS at the GPS visits, the
ARC symptoms were also rated daily in a diary during 14 days
prior to the GPS visit in year 5 (2015). The adjusted mean was
statistically significantly lower in the SQ grass SLIT tablet group

 than in the placebo group with a relative difference of 22% in
favor of SQ grass SLIT tablet (P 5 .005) (Table II).
The use of ARC medication was recorded daily in a diary
during 14 days prior to the GPS visit in year 5 (2015) and
the medication score was calculated (see Table E3 and
the Methods section in this article’s Online Repository at
www.jacionline.org). The adjusted mean of the daily ARC
medication score in the GPS of year 5 was statistically
significantly lower in the SQ grass SLIT tablet group than in
the placebo group; relative reduction SQ grass SLIT tablet versus
placebo was 27% (Table II).
The mean levels of grass pollen–specific IgE were similar at
baseline for the 2 treatment groups. Specific IgE levels increased
during the 5-year trial period. The mean increase from baseline in
log10-transformed–specific IgE (see Fig E5 in this article’s
Online Repository at www.jacionline.org) was significantly
lower for SQ grass SLIT tablet–treated children than for
placebo-treated children after 3 years of treatment and after the
2-year follow-up period (P < .001). The same pattern was
seen for serum total IgE (see Fig E6 in this article’s
Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). The treatment effect
on grass pollen–specific IgE levels was paralleled by a
reduced SPT response to grass pollen allergens in SQ grass
SLIT tablet–treated children at the study’s end (P < .05), which
was 2 years after completion of the SQ grass SLIT tablet
treatment (see Fig E7 in this article’s Online Repository at
www.jacionline.org).
The mean levels of grass pollen–specific IgG4 were similar at
baseline for SQ grass SLIT tablet and placebo. The mean changes
from baseline in log10-transformed–specific IgG4 (see Fig E8 in
this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org) showed
a statistically significant increase with SQ grass SLIT tablet
compared with placebo both after 3 years of treatment and after
the 2-year follow-up (P < .001).
The already established safety profile of the SQ grass SLIT
tablet was confirmed. Overall, 765 children (94%) reported a total
of 7797 AEs during the trial. A similar proportion of the
children in the SQ grass SLIT tablet group and placebo
group reported AEs (95% vs 93%). Most of the reported AEs
(88%) did not lead to investigational medicinal product (IMP)
interruptions or discontinuations, and the vast majority of AEs
(97%) were resolved. This pattern applied to both treatment
groups (Table III). Of the overall trial population, 73 children
(9%) reported a total of 98 SAEs. More children in the SQ grass
SLIT tablet group (11%) reported SAEs than did children from
the placebo group (7%) (Table III). Fifty-two children (6%)
discontinued the trial due to a total of 89 AEs. More children in
the SQ grass SLIT tablet group (10%) discontinued the trial due
to AEs than did children in the placebo group (3%). The
most frequently reported AEs (AEs reported in >
_5% of the
children in the SQ grass SLIT tablet group) were nasopharyngitis,
allergic conjunctivitis, oral pruritus, cough, and gastroenteritis
(Fig 5).
The proportion of the AEs assessed as possibly related to the
IMP was 15% in the SQ grass SLIT tablet group and 4% in the
placebo group (Table III). The most frequently reported
IMP-related AEs were oral pruritus, throat irritation, tongue
pruritus, and ear pruritus. A greater proportion of children in
the SQ grass SLIT tablet group (n 5 244, 61%) reported
IMP-related AEs than children in the placebo group did
(n 5 95, 23%). The majority of all IMP-related AEs were mild
(74%) or moderate (23%) in severity. This pattern applied to
both treatment groups.
For the 2 most frequently reported IMP-related AEs (oral
pruritus and throat irritation), the overall median onset was 1 day
(on the day of first IMP intake). The median number of days from
start of the AE until the event no longer occurred was 14.5 days
for oral pruritus and 5 days for throat irritation for SQ grass SLIT
tablet–treated children.
No deaths occurred during the trial. No events were reported
as serious systemic allergic reactions. Seven of the SAEs
were assessed as possibly related to the IMP; 1 placebo-treated
child: type 1 diabetes; 6 SQ grass SLIT tablet–treated children:
dyspnea, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, asthma, immune
thrombocytopenic purpura, anemia, abdominal pain (see the
Online Repository for details).

 DISCUSSION
ARC is a well-established risk factor for the development of
asthma.20-22 Treating the underlying cause of allergic rhinitis
could potentially represent an attractive modality for the
prevention of asthma in allergic children.
The GAP trial is the first large, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial to investigate asthma prevention with
AIT. When the trial was initiated, there was (and still is) no
consensus regarding an appropriate and generally applicable
diagnostic
algorithm
for
the
identification
of
asthmatic
children in the early stage of the disease. The asthma diagnosis
criteria used in the GAP trial relied to a large degree on the
demonstrationofreversibleimpairmentoflungfunctionassessedin
different ways: reported asthma symptoms and a FEV1 change
>
_12% after b2-agonist administration, observed wheezing that
improved with asthma medication, or observed wheezing and a
FEV1 change >
_12% after b2-agonist administration.
In the GAP trial, 73 children were diagnosed with asthma
according to the prespecified criteria but not all had signs or
symptoms of asthma when evaluated during the 2-year follow-up
period or at the end of the trial. The data obtained in the trial
indicate that onset of asthma may not be a dichotomous ‘‘yes/no’’
event but rather a dynamic process of symptoms and medication
patterns. The data showed that some children diagnosed with
asthma did not show signs of asthma later in the trial, and that
many children not diagnosed with asthma did show signs
suggestive of asthma. The data obtained in the trial indicate that
an appropriate asthma diagnosis in this particular population
should not be based on a single time point evaluation with
emphasis on the demonstration of reversible lung function
impairment but rather should rely on a combined clinical
assessment obtained over a longer observation period, which is
normally done in daily practice.23
The trial did not show an effect of SQ grass SLIT tablet
treatment on the time to onset of asthma as defined by the
fulfilment of the prespecified asthma diagnosis criteria. However,
when looking at asthma symptoms or asthma medication use, the
trial showed a clear and consistent effect of SQ grass SLIT
tablet treatment. The effect was apparent both during the GPS
and during winter, with wheeze, chest tightness, and shortness of
breath being most important for the observed differences
in asthma symptoms between SQ grass SLIT tablet– and
placebo-treated children.
The observed treatment effect on asthma medication use
increased with time due to a continuous increase over time in
the proportion of children with asthma medication use in the
placebo group.
The SQ grass SLIT tablet treatment reduced the proportion of
children with asthma symptoms or use of asthma medication
when evaluated at the end of trial. SQ grass SLIT tablet treatment
also reduced the proportion of children reporting any asthma
symptoms during the entire 5-year trial period and during the

 2-year posttreatment period. Thus, SQ grass SLIT tablet
treatment prevented asthma symptoms in the trial population, as
an added benefit to the treatment effect on ARC. This was
apparent when assessed during the entire 5-year trial period,
during the 2-year follow-up period, and at the trial’s end.
The importance of starting SQ grass SLIT tablet treatment
early in life was evident, as the NNT increased with age as
younger children had a higher risk of developing asthma
symptoms and asthma medication use.
The effectiveness of SQ grass SLIT tablet on prevention of
asthma symptoms in allergic children is indirectly supported by a
large retrospective cohort study of patients with allergic rhinitis
but without asthma (n 5 118,754).24 This study found that in
patients treated with AIT (n 5 2,431), the risk of ‘‘incident
asthma’’ (defined by symptoms and 2 or more prescriptions of
inhaled corticosteroids) was lower than in patients who did not
receive AIT (risk ratio 5 0.60, 95% CI: 0.42-0.84) after a
follow-up period of 5 years. The AIT group was primarily treated
with subcutaneous immunotherapy with only 10 patients in the
analysis being treated with SQ grass SLIT tablets (conducted
shortly after regulatory approval); however, none of these 10
patients had asthma in the follow-up period from 2007 to 2012.
The investigators suggested that AIT use in routine care may
provide a 40% risk reduction for the development of asthma in
patients with AR.
The SQ grass SLIT tablet provided statistically significant
reductions of the ARC symptoms of 22% to 30% when compared
with placebo (P < .002) during the 3 treatment years and the 2
follow-up years. The VAS diary score on ARC symptoms
confirmed the fifth year result with a 22% reduction in the SQ
grass SLIT tablet group relative to that in the placebo
group (P 5 .005). In addition to a reduction of symptoms,
children in the SQ grass SLIT tablet group also had reduced use
of ARC medications by 27% relative to the placebo group
(P < .001).
In
a
previous
trial
investigating
the
long-term
and
disease-modifying effect of the SQ grass SLIT tablet in adults,
the mean ARC symptom score was reduced by 25% to 36% in
the active group relative to the placebo group over the 5 years of
the trial.25 During the 3 years of treatment and the 2-year
follow-up, the analysis of ARC symptoms by VAS scores in
that trial also showed statistically significantly lower scores
for the SQ grass SLIT tablet group of 25% to 37% when
compared with the placebo group (P <
_ .01).26 Thus, the
posttreatment sustained effect demonstrated in the GAP trial
confirms the disease-modifying property of the SQ grass
SLIT tablet in children and is in line with previous trial results
from adults.
In conclusion, SQ grass SLIT tablet treatment prevented
asthma symptoms and asthma medication use in children with
grass pollen ARC and no preexisting asthma. This disease-
modifying effect was greatest in the follow-up period and was
apparent both during GPS and during winter. SQ grass SLIT tablet
treatment also significantly reduced ARC symptoms and
medication use. The effect persisted 2 years posttreatment and
was comparable to what has previously been established in an
adult population. The clinical findings were paralleled by the
immunological findings showing that at the trial’s end, SQ grass

 SLIT tablet–treated children had lower total IgE, lower grass
pollen–specific IgE, and reduced SPT reactivity to grass pollen
than did placebo-treated children.
The SQ grass SLIT tablet had no effect on the time to onset
of asthma (primary endpoint) when diagnosed according to
the predefined criteria; few children fulfilled these criteria
and clinical phenotypes were not stable over the course of the
trial.
No new safety signals were identified, and the safety data
confirmed the already known safety profile.

Clinical implications: The data presented in this article demon-
strate that treatment with the SQ grass SLIT tablet modifies the
grass pollen allergic disease. The disease modification is ex-
pressed by preventing progression from allergic rhinoconjunc-
tivitis symptoms to development of asthma symptoms and
reducing rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms and medication use
during and after treatment termination.

 METHODS
Details of the trial design
The trial was initiated during the fourth quarter of 2009 with
recruitment and screening activities until after the GPS of 2010. To rule
out asthma before randomization, 2 screening visits took place: 1 outside
the pollen season (V1) and 1 during the pollen season (V2). The purpose
of screening V1 was to investigate the subject eligibility in terms of all
inclusion and exclusion criteria. At the screening V2 (placed in the GPS),
all subjects were examined according to the prespecified asthma diagnosis
criteria. Between screening V2 and the randomization visit, diurnal peak
expiratory flow was assessed for 2 weeks. Subjects diagnosed with asthma
were per definition screening failures. After the end of the GPS of 2010,
eligible subjects were randomized to grass SLIT tablet or placebo for 3
consecutive years. The trial continued with double-blinded follow-up for an
additional 2 years. The trial included ‘‘winter visits’’ (V4, V6, V8, V11,
and V13) and ‘‘GPS visits’’ (V5, V7, V9, V12, and V14) each of the
5 years, where asthma status was assessed. In addition there was an ‘‘end
of treatment visit’’ (V10) and a telephone contact prior to V14 informing
about ARC home monitoring during the GPS of 2015. All randomized
subjects were to continue in the trial for 5 years. Subjects experiencing
asthma symptoms during the trial were instructed to call the investigator
for an unscheduled visit. The end of trial visit (V15) took place after the
GPS of 2015.
Details of sample size calculation
The sample size calculations were based on 3 years of observation, because
the original protocol defined an interim analysis after the 3 treatment years.
This was amended to a final analysis after 5 years. Because randomization was
completed at the time of the amendment (February 27, 2012), the amendment
had no influence on the sample size.
Sample size calculation was entirely based on the preventive allergy
treatment (PAT) trial.E1 In the PAT trial, 71% (60 of 85) of children in the
active group were without asthma after 3 years of immunotherapy and 51%
(40 of 78) were without asthma in the open control group (in-house data).
With a sample size in each group of 158, with a total number of 114 asthma
events required (36%), a 0.05 level 2-sided log-rank test for equality of
survival curves would have 95% power to detect a difference between a
proportion of 71% without asthma in the grass SLIT tablet group and 51%
without asthma in the placebo group after 3 years.
Assuming a 20% dropout per year, a total of 618 (158 3 2/0.83) subjects
were required to be randomized.
Details of statistical methodology
Demography and baseline characteristics. Demographic
and baseline characteristics were summarized by treatment group displaying
number of subjects, mean 6 SD, median, 5% quantile, 25% quantile, 75%
quantile, 95% quantile, minimum and maximum for continuous variables, and
frequency tables for categorical variables.
Extent of exposure and definition of GPS. Number of
daily IMP doses used was calculated as the difference between the number of
daily doses dispensed and the number of daily doses returned.
IMP compliance percentage was calculated as the number of daily doses
used divided by the duration of IMP treatment period in days (number of days
from IMP treatment start to IMP treatment stop) and multiplied with 100.
Exposure in treatment years was calculated as the number of daily doses
used divided by 365.
Duration of IMP treatment period, number of tablets used per subject, IMP
compliance, and treatment years were displayed in summary tables by
treatment group.
The GPS was defined for each pollen region as starting on the first day of 3
consecutive days with grass pollen count >
_10 grains/m3 and ending on the last
day of the last occurrence of 3 consecutive days with grass pollen count
>
_10 grains/m3. Start and stop dates of each GPS for each pollen region were
determined and described in the statistical analysis plan before unblinding.
The defined GPS was used to assess whether the date of onset of asthma or
suspicion of asthma was within the GPS.
Endpoints. The primary efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint
‘‘time to onset of asthma’’ as defined by the protocol criteria (1) to (3) was
performed with a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. The model
included treatment group as a fixed effect. Age at randomization was included
as a covariate. Country was included as a random effect assumed to follow a
gamma distribution. Thus this was a shared Cox gamma frailty model. Based
on this model, the estimated adjusted hazard ratio for time to onset of asthma
for grass SLIT tablet compared with placebo was presented together with the
2-sided 95% CI and a P value. All subjects provided data to the primary
analysis.
The proportion of subjects having no asthma symptoms and no asthma
medication use since last visit at the end of the trial (V13 to V14) was
summarized by treatment group and visit without imputation.
The analysis of the odds of not having any asthma symptoms and any
asthma medication use between V13 and V14 was performed with a
generalized logistic regression analysis. Treatment was included as a fixed
effect, age as a covariate, and country as a random effect. The adjusted OR for
having an asthma symptom– and asthma medication–free period (V13 to V14)
at the end of trial visit was estimated and the 2-sided 95% CI presented. For
subjects discontinued before the end of the trial (V13 to V14), asthma
symptoms and asthma medication use was imputed by last observation being
carried forward. No imputation was done for subjects discontinued before first
assessment of asthma symptoms and asthma medication use (V4 or an
unscheduled visit).
The proportion of subjects with asthma symptoms and asthma medication
use since last visit was calculated by treatment group without imputation for
each visit, each year, the follow-up period, and the entire trial period. Odds for
each binary outcome (yes/no) were analyzed by visit, by year, by period, and
for the entire trial.
The analysis by visit and by year was done with a repeated measurement
generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with a logit link function.
The dependent variable was binary (yes/no). The explanatory variables
included as fixed effects were age at randomization, treatment, visit/year,
and treatment–visit/year interaction. Subject and country were included as
random effects. The integral over the random effects space was approximated
by the Laplace approximation.
The by-period analysis was done with a repeated measurement GLMM
with a logit link function. The dependent variable was binary (yes/no). The
explanatory variables included as fixed effects were age at randomization,
treatment, period, and treatment-period interaction. Subject was included as a
random effect. The estimated OR for grass SLIT tablet versus placebo was
reported along with 95% CI and a P value. The estimate was subject-specific.
The multivariate t distribution was used for CI and P value.
The analysis for the entire trial was done with a GLMM with a logit link
function. The dependent variable was binary (yes/no). The explanatory
variables included as fixed effects were age at randomization and treatment.
Country was included as a random effect. The estimated OR for grass SLIT
tablet versus placebo was reported along with 95% CI and a P value. The
estimate was subject-specific. The multivariate t distribution was used for
CI and P value.
The relative risk (RR) and relative risk reduction (RRR) of grass SLIT
tablet versus placebo are calculated based on the estimated coefficients (coef)
in the GLMM:
RRR 5 12RR 5
ecoef Grazax�
11ecoef Grazax
ecoef Placebo=11ecoef Placebo
The yearly VAS scoring of ARC symptoms at the GPS visits was evaluated
with a repeated measures analysis. Treatment, visit, and treatment by visit
were included as fixed effects; baseline VAS as a covariate; and country as a

P value were presented for each visit.
The average daily VAS scoring of ARC symptoms prior to the 2015 GPS
visit (V14) was evaluated with a linear mixed effect (LME) model. The

 average VAS was the response variable, treatment was a fixed class effect, and
country was a random class variable. Different residual errors for each
treatment group were specified in the LME model. The LME model was
estimated using the method of restricted maximum likelihood.
The average daily ARC medication score prior to the 2015 GPS visit (V14)
was evaluated with a LME model. The average ARC medication score was the
responsevariable, treatment was a fixed class effect, and country was a random
class variable. Different residual errors for each treatment group were
specified in the LME model. The LME model was estimated using the
method of restricted maximum likelihood.
The NNTwas calculated as 1/[difference in predicted probability of having
asthma symptoms and asthma medication use] placebo – SQ grass SLIT tablet
using a population based model (generalized estimation equation).
Difference between groups in SPT diameter was analyzed by Wilcoxon
rank sum test.
AEs were summarized by treatment group, system organ class and
preferred term displaying the number of subjects in treatment group, number
and percentage of subjects having the AE, as well as number of events.
Furthermore, AEs were summarized according to severity, relationship,
outcome, and seriousness. Physical examinations/asthma physical examina-
tions were summarized by examination and treatment group via shift tables
displaying change in normal/abnormal from pretreatment visits to posttreat-
ment visits.
Calculation of ARC medication score
The total daily ARC medication score was calculated as the sum of the total
daily scores for each medication (see Table E3). The average ARC medication
score was calculated as the average of total daily ARC medication score based
on observed data during the 14 days of recording.
Details on the 7 IMP-related SAEs
The case of dyspnea occurred in a subject treated with the first dose of SQ
grass SLIT tablet. The subject swallowed the tablet and had a sense of

difficulty breathing. No action was taken with regard to the IMP in response to
the event.
The case of generalized tonic-clonic seizure occurred while the subject was
playing football, 8 months after first dose of SQ grass SLIT tablet. The subject
was hospitalized but did not receive any medicinal treatment for the event.
During hospitalization, an electroencephalogram revealed possibly epileptic
activity. The subject fully recovered from the event a few hours after
admission. IMP was discontinued 4 days after the event.
The case of asthma occurred after 10 months on SQ grass SLIT tablet
treatment. The subject was spending time in the garden shortly after the lawn
was mowed and experienced hoarseness and cough throughout the day. The
following evening, the subject had a relapse and was hospitalized and treated
with b2-agonist and recovered. No action was taken with IMP due to the event.
The case of immune thrombocytopenic purpura was reported in a subject on
SQ grass SLIT tablet, 13 days after first IMP intake, when the subject was
admitted to hospital due to a small sports incidence. The subject presented
with multiple hematomas and petechiae. The IMP was permanently
discontinued due to the event.
The case of anemia occurred in a subject treated with SQ grass SLIT tablet
for 2 years. The subject had a sister with anemia and was therefore tested when
experiencing tiredness for several months. The subject was diagnosed with
anemia due to iron deficiency. The subject discontinued IMP due to the event
and was discontinued from the trial.
The case of abdominal pain occurred in a SQ grass SLIT tablet–treated
subject 2 weeks after treatment initiation. The subject also experienced fever
simultaneously. The IMP was temporarily interrupted due to the event.
The case of type 1 diabetes occurred in a subject on placebo 859 days
after first IMP treatment in the trial. The subject discontinued IMP due to the
event.
