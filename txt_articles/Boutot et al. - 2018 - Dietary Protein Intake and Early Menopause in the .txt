Early menopause, which is the cessation of ovarian function before age 45 years, affects 5%–10% of Western women
and is associated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes. Literature suggests that high levels of vegetable
protein intake may prolong female reproductive function. We evaluated the association of long-term intake of vegetable
protein, animal protein, and specific protein-rich foods with incidence of early natural menopause in the Nurses’ Health
Study II cohort. Women included in analyses (n = 85,682) were premenopausal at baseline (1991) and followed until
2011 for onset of natural menopause. Protein intake was assessed via food frequency questionnaire. In Cox proportional
hazard models that were adjusted for age, smoking, body mass index, and other factors, women in the highest quintile of
cumulatively averaged vegetable protein intake (median, 6.5% of calories) had a significant 16% lower risk of early men-
opause compared with women in the lowest quintile (3.9% of calories; 95% confidence interval: 0.73, 0.98; P for trend =
0.02). Intake of specific foods, including pasta, dark bread, and cold cereal, was also associated with lower risk (P < 0.05).
Conversely, animal protein intake was unrelated to risk. High consumption of vegetable protein, equivalent to 3–4 servings
per day of protein-rich foods, is associated with lower incidence of early menopause in US women.

Nurses’ Health Study.
Early menopause, or the cessation of ovarian function before
to age 45 years, affects 5%–10% of Western women and is
associated with increased risk of adverse health outcomes,
including premature mortality and cardiovascular disease (1–3).
Additionally, women who experience early menopause may
have reduced fertility as long as a decade before onset of meno-
pause (1, 3). The causes of natural early menopause are not well
understood, and most diagnoses are not attributable to genetic
factors or autoimmune conditions (1, 2).
Results of recent studies suggest dietary protein sources may
be associated with infertility, rate of ovarian aging, oocyte qual-
ity, and timing of menopause (4–12). In a study of diet composi-
tion and ovulatory infertility in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS)
II, high levels of animal protein intake were positively associ-
ated with infertility, whereas vegetable protein intake was asso-
ciated with lower risk for infertility; replacing 5% of animal
protein intake with vegetable protein was associated with
50% lower risk for infertility (P = 0.007) (8). Additionally,
vegetable protein and animal protein have been shown to
have different associations with ovarian function in animal
models (6).
To our knowledge, the association between vegetable and
animal protein intake and early menopause has not been directly
evaluated. We prospectively investigated these associations
among women enrolled in the NHS II, hypothesizing that intake
of higher amounts of vegetable protein would be inversely asso-
ciated with incidence of early menopause, whereas animal pro-
tein intake would be associated with higher incidence of early
menopause.
METHODS
The NHS II began in 1989 when 116,686 US female regis-
tered nurses, aged 25–42 years, completed a mailed question-
naire and provided information on current and lifelong health,

 prescription medication use, and lifestyle factors. Participants
have completed new questionnaires every 2 years since, and
the follow-up for each questionnaire cycle has been at least
90%. The institutional review board at Brigham and Women’s
Hospital (Boston, Massachusetts) approved the NHS II study
protocol. The present analysis uses questionnaire data from
1991 through 2011.
Protein assessment
We assessed intake of total protein and protein from vegeta-
ble and animal sources in 1991 and every 4 years thereafter via
the Harvard food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (13). We
asked participants to report how often they consumed a single
serving of 131 foods, beverages, and dietary supplements over
the previous year, with response options ranging from “never or
less than once a month” to “6+ per day.” We excluded partici-
pants from the analysis if they reported implausible calorie
intake (i.e., <600 or >3,500 kcal/day) (Figure 1).
Protein intake was calculated by multiplying the protein con-
tent of a single serving of each food item by its frequency of
consumption and then summing across all items. Intakes of veg-
etable and animal protein were derived similarly, as were in-
takes of other macro- and micronutrients. We then calculated
total, vegetable, and animal protein intake as percentages of total
calories by multiplying intake of each protein type in grams by
4 kcal/g, dividing by the total number of calories consumed, and
multiplying by 100. Intakes of micronutrients were adjusted for
total energy intake using the residual method (13).
The validity and reproducibility of the FFQ were evaluated
in the original NHS, a similar cohort to NHS II (14, 15). The
correlation coefficient for total protein assessed by FFQ versus
from 4 weeks of daily food records was 0.47.
Assessment of early menopause
Menopausal status and timing have been assessed biennially
in the NHS II starting in 1989. Participants were asked if their
menstrual periods had ceased; response options were 1) no: pre-
menopausal; 2) yes: no menstrual periods; 3) yes: had meno-
pause but now have periods induced by hormones; and 4) not
sure (e.g., started hormones before cessation of periods).
Women who reported that their periods had ceased were asked
to report the age at which their periods ceased (open response)
and for which of the following reasons their periods ceased: 1)
surgery, 2) radiation or chemotherapy, or 3) natural cessation.
Women were subsequently asked if they had had a hysterec-
tomy, an oophorectomy (bilateral or single), or used replace-
ment sex hormones. Women were followed for incidence of
menopause until 2011. We defined cases of early menopause
as women who reported natural menopause between return of
their baseline questionnaire (1991) and before age 45 years.
Self-assessment of menopause has been validated in the
NHS. In the NHS, 82% of women experiencing natural meno-
pause repeatedly recalled the same age at menopause within 1
year on repeated health questionnaires, whereas 99% of women
whose age at menopause was confirmed via medical records
accurately reported their age at menopause within 1 year (16).
Covariate assessment
Age at menarche and race/ethnicity were reported in 1989.
Oral contraception (OC) use and parity were assessed bienni-
ally. Months of breastfeeding were self-reported biennially from
1989 until 2003, and information was updated in 2009. Physical
activity was assessed every 4 years and used to calculate meta-
bolic equivalent of task hours per week (17, 18). Body mass
index (measured as weight in kilograms divided by the square
of height in meters) was calculated using height reported at
baseline and weight reported biennially. Smoking status and
quantity were assessed biennially and used to calculate pack-
years. Dietary factors, including intake of alcohol, carbohy-
drates, fats, vitamin D, and calcium, were assessed via FFQ, as
described earlier in the Methods.
Statistical analyses
The present analysis was limited to NHS II participants
who were premenopausal in 1991, returned a valid FFQ in
1991, and returned at least 1 more survey after 1991. Women
were further excluded if they had had an oophorectomy, a
hysterectomy, or had been diagnosed with a cancer other than
nonmelanoma skin cancer before 1991 (Figure 1).
To assess covariates for inclusion in statistical models, we
first divided participants into quintiles by vegetable protein
intake in 1991 based on the distribution within the cohort. We
then compared the distribution of covariates measured at base-
line with vegetable protein intake in age-adjusted general lin-
ear models.

 We evaluated the associations of total, vegetable, and animal
protein intakes with early menopause by using Cox propor-
tional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confi-
dence intervals stratified by age in months and questionnaire
cycle. To test for linear trend across quintiles, we modeled the
median value of each quintile as a continuous variable. Partici-
pants contributed follow-up time from the date of return of the
1991 questionnaire until the onset of menopause, age 45 years,
hysterectomy, oophorectomy, diagnosis of cancer other than
nonmelanoma skin cancer, death, loss to follow-up, or the end
of follow-up in June 2011, whichever came first. In a sensitiv-
ity analysis, we further censored at first report of hormone ther-
apy use and excluded women who had used hormone therapy
before baseline.
We assessed long-term protein intake in several ways. We
first evaluated risk associated with intake only at baseline
(1991). We then repeated our analysis using the cumulative
average of intake across follow-up, updating exposure infor-
mation every 4 years. Results from these analyses were similar;
thus, only the cumulative average models are emphasized
because they may best reflect the impact of long-term diet (19).
Our initial model (model 1) was adjusted only for age and total,
vegetable, or animal protein. In model 2, we mutually adjusted
vegetable and animal protein intake (both as percentage of calo-
ries from protein) for one another and included calories per day,
because these variables were considered a priori. In model 3,
we additionally adjusted for lifestyle variables (i.e., body mass
index, smoking, physical activity), reproductive variables
(i.e., parity, age at menarche, breast feeding, OC use, number of
pregnancies), and dairy protein. These factors were also chosen
a priori; none of these factors met statistical criteria for con-
founding in our regression models (>10% change in the hazard
ratio for protein intake). Race/ethnicity and additional dietary
factors (i.e., alternative healthy eating index diet score, carbo-
hydrates, saturated fat, ω-3 fatty acids intake, vitamin D, cal-
cium, vitamin B6, and alcohol) were also tested for inclusion,
but these factors had minimal impact on estimates when added
to regression models and were not included in final models.
To address residual confounding, we repeated our analyses in
subgroups of never smokers and women who never reported
OC use.
Finally, we examined if specific foods rich in protein were
related to risk of early menopause. We tested how each 1-
serving-per-day increase in the following foods and food
groups was associated with early menopause risk: red meats
and poultry, red meats, processed meats, chicken/turkey, sea-
food, eggs, soy/tofu, peas and lima beans, beans and lentils,
peanuts, other nuts, peanut butter, pasta, dark bread, and cold
cereal. Statistical analyses were conducted with SAS version
9.3 software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
Distributions of baseline covariates by quintile of vegeta-
ble protein consumption in 1991 are presented in Table 1.
Women with higher vegetable protein intake were older and
consumed less animal protein than women with lower intake.
Higher vegetable protein intake was associated with lower
body mass index, fewer pack-years of smoking, and less OC
use, but longer duration of breastfeeding and higher physical
activity levels (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Foods explaining
the greatest amount of variation in vegetable protein intake at
baseline included pasta (7.85%), dark bread (6.33%), and cold
cereal (6.11%). Soy intake explained 0.55% of the variation.
Between 1991 and 2011, 2,041 women in the analytic cohort
experienced onset of early natural menopause. The analytic
cohort (n = 85,682) contributed 1,126,100 years of person-
time. In the age-adjusted model (model 1), women in the highest
quintile of vegetable protein intake (median, 6.5%) had a 17%
lower risk of early menopause as compared with women in the
lowest quintile (median, 3.9%; 95% confidence interval (CI):
0.72, 0.95; P for trend = 0.005; Table 2). Addition of covariates
only slightly attenuated results. After adjustment for all covar-
iates (model 3), women in the highest quintile of vegetable
protein intake had a significant 16% lower risk of experienc-
ing early menopause as compared with women in the lowest
quintile (95% CI: 0.73, 0.98; P for trend = 0.02). Each 1%
increase in vegetable protein intake was associated with a sig-
nificant 6% lower risk of early menopause (95% CI: 0.90,
0.99). Though relatively few women in our study consumed
very high levels of vegetable protein and our power for analy-
ses of more extreme intake levels was limited, the hazard ratio
for early menopause in women who consumed at least 9% of
their calories from vegetable protein was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.19,
0.88) compared with those who consumed less than 4% of cal-
ories from vegetable protein (results not shown). In contrast,
neither animal protein intake (P for trend = 0.74) nor total
protein intake (P for trend = 0.52) was associated with risk of
early menopause.
Results from all other analyses were similar. In analyses
considering vegetable protein intake at baseline only, women
with the highest vegetable protein intake had a nonsignificant
12% lower risk of early menopause (model 3, 95% CI: 0.77,
1.02; data not shown). In a sensitivity analysis censoring follow-
up at first hormone therapy use and excluding those with hor-
mone therapy use before 1991 (n = 83,885 women; n = 1,759
events), the association of vegetable protein and early menopause
risk was slightly stronger; in fully adjusted models, women in the
fifth quintile of vegetable protein consumption had a 19% lower
risk as compared with women in the first quintile (95% CI: 0.69,
0.95; P for trend = 0.01; Appendix Table 1). In analyses limited
to never smokers (n = 55,942 women; n = 1,215 events), results
were slightly attenuated (model 3: comparing quintile 5 vs.
quintile 1, HR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.71, 1.04; data not shown).
In women who never used OC (n = 8,699 women; n = 224
events), women in the fifth quintile had a nonsignificant 23%
lower risk compared with those in the first quintile (model 3:
95% CI: 0.49, 1.21; data not shown).
Finally, we assessed how specific protein-rich foods had
associations with early menopause (Table 3). Intake of pasta,
dark bread, and cold cereal were each associated with lower
risk. For example, each 1 serving per day of pasta intake was
associated with a 36% lower risk of early menopause, after
adjusting for all covariates (95% CI: 0.49, 0.83). In contrast,
red meat intake was positively associated with risk, such that
each 1 serving per day was associated with a 12% higher risk
(95% CI: 1.01, 1.23).

 DISCUSSION
In this prospective study, we found that higher vegetable
protein intake was associated with lower likelihood of early
menopause. Women consuming approximately 6.5% of their
daily calories as vegetable protein had a significant 16% lower
risk of early menopause than women consuming approxi-
mately 4% of their calories intake as vegetable protein. For a
woman consuming a 2,000-calorie diet, this is equivalent to
32.5 g of vegetable protein per day, or 3–4 servings of protein-
rich foods such as enriched pasta or breakfast cereal, tofu, and
nuts. In contrast, high levels of animal protein intake were not
associated with early menopause.
Few studies have evaluated how protein intake is associated
with timing of menopause and, to our knowledge, no studies
have specifically evaluated risk of early menopause. In a pro-
spective analysis of 1,130 premenopausal Japanese women,
Nagata et al. (10) assessed how protein source was related to
timing of menopause over 6 years. Likelihood of experiencing
menopause during follow-up did not differ between women
with the highest vegetable protein intake (median, 45.8 g/day,
energy-adjusted) and lowest intake (median, 35.7 g/day; HR =
0.99) but was higher among women with moderate intake
(median, 40.3 g/day; HR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.13, 2.02). In con-
trast, neither soy protein intake nor animal protein intake was
associated with menopause onset (10). The ability to generalize
between the findings of these studies is unclear, because aver-
age vegetable protein intake was considerably higher in the Jap-
anese population, whereas animal protein intake was lower. In
addition, a greater proportion of vegetable protein was from soy-
based sources than in our US-based study, where the majority
of vegetable protein intake was from wheat- and nut-based
sources.
Nagel et al. (5) prospectively assessed how intake of specific
foods and nutrients was associated with likelihood of meno-
pause over 6 years among 5,110 German women (EPIC-Hei-
delberg). High levels of protein intake were associated with a
nonsignificantly lower risk of menopause (HR = 0.78, 95% CI:
0.59, 1.04; P for trend = 0.09). Although the authors did not

 directly compare protein sources, they reported significantly
lower risk of menopause onset with higher meat intake and no
association with soy product intake. Additionally, in a retro-
spective analysis in the Shanghai Women’s Health Study, high
levels of total protein intake were associated with slightly later
mean age at menopause (48.9 vs. 49.3 years comparing lowest
and highest; P for trend = 0.02) (4). Vegetable and animal pro-
tein sources were not directly evaluated, but the authors reported
no association with either meat or soy food intake.
Each of the previous studies considered associations of pro-
tein intake with overall age at menopause, which may differ
from associations with risk of early menopause. Study partici-
pants in these evaluations were substantially older at baseline
than in our study, precluding the ability to specifically evalu-
ate risk for early menopause. For example, in the Nagata et al.
study (10), participants were 35–54 years old at baseline
(mean age = 42.7 years) and the observed age at menopause
ranged from 43–57 years. In the German study, participants
were 35–65 years old at baseline and mean age at menopause
was 51.3 years (5). Factors contributing to menopause timing
among women who remain premenopausal into their 50s are
likely to be substantially different from those associated with
menopause before age 45 years.
Results from experimental studies in animal models pro-
vide physiologic evidence for a association between vegetable
protein and rate of ovarian aging. Appt et al. (6) randomly as-
signed 61 female cynomolgus macaques to receive either a
vegetable protein–based diet (soy with isoflavones) or an ani-
mal protein–based diet (casein and lactalbumin). After 32
months of treatment, ovaries were removed for analyses of

 follicle counts. Macaques randomly assigned to the animal
protein diet had significantly fewer primordial, primary, and
secondary follicles than those assigned to the soy-based diet.
These changes were accompanied by changes in plasma lipid
levels. Macaques fed the animal protein diet had significantly
higher total and non–high density lipoprotein cholesterol le-
vels and lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels than
did monkeys fed the soy diet. The extent of iliac artery athero-
sclerosis, as assessed by artery plaque size, was also greater in
the casein-and-lactalbumin group than the soy group (6).
The observations of Appt et al. (6) are consistent with their
hypothesis that an atherogenic diet adversely affects the size of
the follicle pool and decreases ovarian reserve, perhaps through
promoting atherosclerosis in ovarian arteries and reducing
blood flow. Alternatively, Appt et al. proposed that soy-based
diets are protective of ovarian function and the slow rate of folli-
cle depletion through estrogen-related pathways or by reducing
inflammation and/or oxidative stress (6). Although it remains
unknown whether these findings can directly translate to pre-
menopausal women, they suggest a potentially important mech-
anism linking protein source with early reproductive decline
and menopause onset in humans. Studies are warranted to directly
evaluate how diet protein source may correlate with follicle count,
anti-Müllerian hormone levels, and rate of decline of ovarian
reserve.
Our study has several potential limitations. Cumulative
vegetable protein intake was self-reported by FFQ. Although
this technique is common and well validated, some misclas-
sification of intake is possible. Similarly, age at menopause
was self-reported; this has been shown to be highly accurate
within a similar population, however (16). Importantly, in
our prospective study, we would expect any misclassification
of protein intake or menopause timing to be nondifferential;
therefore, the associations we observed would be most likely
be underestimated rather than overestimated.
In summary, we observed a lower risk of early onset of nat-
ural menopause among women who consumed high levels of
protein from vegetable sources, equivalent to 3–4 servings per
day of protein-rich foods, but no similar association with ani-
mal protein intake. Additional prospective evaluations of this
association are warranted, including studies addressing potential
underlying mechanisms involving both soy and non–soy-based
vegetable proteins. A better understanding of how dietary vege-
table protein intake is associated with ovarian aging may identify
ways for women to modify their risk of early onset of meno-
pause and associated health conditions.
