 Poverty or low socioeconomic status (SES) during childhood is
a well-known distal risk factor for subsequent criminal and
substance misuse behaviours.1,2 Recently, a Norwegian total
population study found that children of parents in the lowest
income decile were twice as likely to be convicted of a violent
or drug crime compared with their peers in the fifth decile.3
Similarly, a number of longitudinal USA studies have linked low
income levels with substance use disorders.4,5 Nevertheless, these
findings could potentially result from inadequate adjustment of
familial risk factors.6 Behavioural genetic investigations have
found that the liabilities for both violent offending and substance
misuse are substantially influenced by shared genetic and, to a
lesser extent, family environmental factors.7,8 Consequently, it has
been proposed that quasi-experimental, genetically informative
research designs that explicitly take such factors into account
could be integral in elucidating the causal mechanisms further.9
A few smaller quasi-experimental studies have been performed
to date and they suggest that the inverse associations between
parental income during childhood and development of behavioural
problems remain after such adjustments.10–13 The generalisability
of these findings is still questioned because of potential selection
bias. Determining the causal nature of these associations is crucial
to inform policy and clinical preventive efforts.
Method
Sample
We linked data from nine Swedish, longitudinal, total-population
registers maintained by governmental agencies. The linkage was
possible through the unique 10-digit civic registration number
assigned to all Swedish citizens at birth and to immigrants upon
arrival to the country. We were granted access to de-identified
linked data after approval from the Regional Research Ethics
Committee at Karolinska Institutet.
The following nine registers were used: (a) the Total
Population Register (TPR) contained basic information (for
example, gender and date of birth) for all individuals registered
as inhabitants of Sweden; (b) the Multi-Generation Register
supplied data that linked index individuals found in the TPR to
their biological parents, thus enabling us to connect siblings; (c)
the Medical Birth Register included pregnancy data with close to
full coverage (499%) of all births in Sweden since 1973;14 (d)
the Education Register contained information on highest level of
completed formal education; (e) the Cause of Death Register
provided data on principal and contributing causes of death since
1958; (f) the Migration Register supplied data on dates for
migration into or out of Sweden; (g) the Integrated Database
for Labour Market Research (LISA) provided annual information
on family disposable income and welfare recipiency since 1990 on
all individuals 16 years of age and older who were registered in
Sweden as of December 31 for each year; (h) the National Patient
Register provided data on psychiatric in-patient care since 1973
(ICD-8, -9 and -10)15–17 and out-patient care since 2001 (ICD-10);
and (i) the National Crime Register supplied detailed information
on all criminal convictions in lower general court in Sweden since
1973. Plea bargaining is not allowed and conviction data include all
individuals who received custodial or non-custodial sentences; also
those cases where the prosecutor decided to caution or fine. Only
individuals age 15 or older are legally responsible in Sweden; hence,
we were not able to study criminal offending prior to age 15.
A total of 594 127 children were born in Sweden between 1989
and 1993 and registered in the Medical Birth Registry. We chose to
exclude children from multiple births (n = 14 670), those who had
serious malformations at birth (n = 20 905) or who could not be
linked to their biological parents (n = 3 956). Furthermore, we
excluded data for children who had either died (n = 2 525) or
emigrated from Sweden before they reached 15 years of age
(n = 18 301). Last, we removed individuals with missing data on
parental labour market exposures (n = 7603). Our final sample

Background
Low socioeconomic status in childhood is a well-known
predictor of subsequent criminal and substance misuse
behaviours but the causal mechanisms are questioned.
Aims
To investigate whether childhood family income predicts
subsequent violent criminality and substance misuse and
whether the associations are in turn explained by
unobserved familial risk factors.
Method
Nationwide Swedish quasi-experimental, family-based
study following cohorts born 1989–1993 (ntotal = 526 167,
ncousins = 262 267, nsiblings = 216 424) between the ages
of 15 and 21 years.
Results
Children of parents in the lowest income quintile
experienced a seven-fold increased hazard rate (HR) of being
convicted of violent criminality compared with peers in the
highest quintile (HR = 6.78, 95% CI 6.23–7.38). This association
was entirely accounted for by unobserved familial risk factors
(HR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.44–2.03). Similar pattern of effects was
found for substance misuse.
Conclusions
There were no associations between childhood family
income and subsequent violent criminality and substance
misuse once we had adjusted for unobserved familial risk
factors.

 consisted of 88.6% of the targeted population (n = 526 167). The
sample included 262 267 cousins and 216 424 siblings nested
within 114 671 extended and 105 470 nuclear families.
Measures: exposure variables
Childhood family income throughout ages 1 to 15 years
We calculated mean disposable family income (net sum of wage
earnings, welfare and retirement benefits, etc.) of both biological
parents for each offspring and year between 1990 and 2008.
Income measures were inflation-adjusted to 1990 values according
to the consumer price index provided by Statistics Sweden (http://
www.scb.se/en_/). Econometric researchers have long recognised
that single annual income exposure measures generally suffer from
substantial measurement error because of their inability to
accurately depict long-term SES, often leading to attenuation
bias.18,19 Therefore, annual variables were used to calculate the
mean parental income throughout each offspring’s childhood
(ages 1 through 15).
Early critics challenged the linearity assumption used by
studies adopting continuous income measures by contending that
criminality is largely confined to the lowest social strata, often
referred to as ‘the underclass’ or ‘the poor’, with little to no
difference being found between the strata in the mid to upper
ranges of the income distribution.20 Others have argued that
the cause of the spurious correlations are because of separate
mechanisms promoting deviant behaviours on both ends of
the income distribution resulting in weak mean predictions.1
We decided, therefore, to test potential non-linear effects by
categorising our income measure in quintiles.
Confounders
Gender, birth year and birth order (dichotomous; first born and
other) were included in all models. We also adjusted for highest
parental education (divided into primary, secondary and tertiary
level qualifications) and parental ages (five age categories; 520,
20–25, 25–30, 30–35 and 435) at the time of the first-born child
and parental history of ever being admitted to hospital for a
mental disorder (ICD-8/9: 290–315; ICD-10: F00–F99).
Measures: outcome variables
Violent crime was defined as a conviction for homicide, assault,
robbery, threats and violence against an officer, gross violation
of a person’s/woman’s integrity, unlawful threats, unlawful
coercion, kidnapping, illegal confinement, arson, intimidation,
or sexual offences (rape, indecent assault, indecent exposure or
child molestation, but excluding prostitution, hiring of prostitutes
or possession of child pornography).21
In line with previous studies using Swedish total population
data,8,22 we used an omnibus measure of substance misuse
consisting of convictions of any drug-related crimes (defined as
crimes against the Narcotic Drugs Act (SFS 1968:64) or driving
under the influence of alcohol and/or illicit substances) or having
been diagnosed with an alcohol- or drug-misuse-related disease in
in-patient or out-patient settings (ICD-8: 291, 303–4, 571, E853,
E856.4, E859, E860, N980; ICD-9: 291, 303–5, 357.5, 425.5,
535.3, 571.0–571.3, E850, E854.1–2, E855.2, E860, N980; ICD-10:
F10, G32.2, G62.1, G72.1, I42.6, K29.2, K70, K85, X41–2, X45,
X61–2, X65, Y11 (with T43.6), Y12 (with T40) and Y15 (with T51)).
Statistical analyses
To account for time at risk, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) with
corresponding 95% confidence intervals for adolescent violent
crime or substance misuse by fitting Cox proportional hazards
regression models to the data. The participants entered the study
at their fifteenth birthday and were subsequently followed up for a
median time of 3.5 years. The maximum follow-up time was
6 years. Those who emigrated or died during follow-up were
censored.
We
fitted
two separate
models
for
the
entire sample
(n = 526 167) that gradually adjusted for observed confounding
variables. Model I adjusted for gender, birth year and birth order,
whereas Model II also adjusted for highest parental education,
parental ages at the time of the first-born child and parental
history of admission to hospital for a mental disorder.
To
assess
the
effects
also
of
unobserved
genetic
and
environmental factors, we fitted stratified Cox regression models
to cousin (n = 262 267) and sibling (n = 216 424) samples with
extended or nuclear family as stratum, respectively. The stratified
models allow for the estimation of heterogeneous baseline hazard
rates across families and thus capture unobserved familial
factors.23 This also implies that exposure comparisons are made
within families.24 Model III was fitted to the cousin sample and
adjusted for observed confounders and unobserved within
extended-family factors. Model IV was fitted on the sibling sample
and accounted for unobserved nuclear family factors and for
gender, birth year and birth order.
Cousin and sibling correlations on the exposure variable
were calculated based on a varying-intercepts, mixed-effects
model where the intercepts are allowed to vary across families.25
The magnitude of the variation was expressed as an intraclass
correlation (ICC).26 The ICC measures the degree to which
observations are similar to one another within clusters; in this case
cousins and siblings nested within extended and nuclear family
clusters. The measure ranges between 0 and 1, where the latter
implies that cousins and siblings have identical exposure values
within families.
All models were fitted in Stata 12.1 IC for Mac.
Results
Demographic sample characteristics are presented in Table 1.
Adolescent violent crime and substance misuse rates were
inversely correlated with the childhood family income. As an
example, children of parents in the lowest income quintile
experienced a rate of 11.05 per 1000 person-years of being
convicted of a violent crime while the same estimate was 1.77
for the children of parents in the highest income quintile.
Table 2 presents results from multivariable Cox regression
models; children of parents in the lowest income quintile had
an almost seven-fold increased hazard of being convicted of
violent crime (crude HR = 6.78, 95% CI 6.23–7.38) and a two-fold
increase of substance misuse (HR = 2.45, 95% CI: 2.32–2.58) in
adolescence compared with peers whose parents were in the fifth
quintile (Model I).
When we made adjustments for observed family-wide risk
factors (Model II), the effects of childhood family income on
violent criminal convictions were significantly attenuated but
remained strong (HR = 3.93, 95% CI 3.59–4.30). Controlling for
family-wide risk factors also affected the association with
substance misuse (HR = 1.98, 95% CI 1.86–2.10). Model III
expanded on Model II by also accounting for unobserved familial
risk factors within extended families through cousin comparisons.
This adjustment reduced the hazard ratios by 50% and 25% for
adolescent violent crime and substance misuse, respectively.
Finally, we studied the effects of unobserved familial risk factors
within nuclear families using sibling comparisons (Model IV).
287
Family income, adolescent violent criminality and substance misuse
 Sariaslan et al
The associations between childhood family income and the
outcomes disappeared completely; hazard ratios were 0.95 (95%
CI 0.44–2.03) for violent crime and 1.11 (95% CI 0.62–1.98) for
substance misuse, respectively. This suggested that unobserved
familial factors fully accounted for the increased hazard ratios
found in previous models.
Sensitivity analyses
Sibling correlations for childhood family income were, expectedly,
rather high (Table 3), suggesting that the within-family variability
was
somewhat
limited.
Consequently,
we
re-fitted
models
presented in Table 2 to the childhood family income exposure
variables covering single-year age periods (online Table DS1).
Sibling correlations for the latter were 0.57–0.74. Despite larger
heterogeneity between siblings in these exposures, the results
remained quite similar.
As suggested in Table 4, we could not find any period effects
of the timing of exposures on substance misuse. The crude
associations presented in Model I were high, but consistently
appeared explained by familial factors (Model IV). Differences
between estimates for male-only and total population samples
were small. By contrast, the female-only estimates indicated low
precision with wide confidence intervals, especially for violent
convictions within families. The discrepancies across estimates
for the different birth order subsamples and analyses excluding
second-generation immigrants from non-Nordic countries and
the total population sample were marginal.
The extent to which other non-linear categorisations (i.e.
tertiles and deciles) of childhood family income had an impact
on the results was tested and we found negligible differences (data
not presented; available from the authors on request).
In addition, we explored whether results were explained by
relatively low rates of our outcome variables by re-fitting models
to the following alternative outcomes: (a) any criminal conviction
and (b) any property conviction. Corresponding rates were 25.27
and 10.70 per 1000 person-years, respectively. The general pattern
of effects found in the main analyses remained (online Table DS2),
and the magnitudes of estimates were also very similar to those of
models predicting substance misuse (seen in Tables 2 and 4).

 Family income, adolescent violent criminality and substance misuse
Finally, we investigated whether the results were specific to the
childhood SES exposure variable by re-fitting the models to an
alternative indicator; parental welfare recipiency between ages 1
through 15. Individuals who receive means-tested welfare benefits
in Sweden are not primarily characterised by their lack of financial
means; they are a selected group with a wide range of psychosocial
issues.27
The
results
nonetheless
matched
those
exploring
childhood family income (online Table DS3).
Discussion
Using traditional epidemiological methods, we found that low
income in one’s family of origin was indeed associated with higher
risk of violent offending and substance misuse during adolescence.
However, the excess risks became marginal or disappeared
completely when we gradually adjusted for familial risk factors
of these associations by studying within-extended family and
within nuclear-family estimates (with cousin and sibling controls,
respectively). This held true when childhood SES was defined
either as parental disposable income or welfare recipiency
throughout child ages 1–15 years. Sensitivity analyses proved the
results were robust across gender, ethnicity and age periods and
were not influenced by limited within-family variability in the
exposure variables.
Our finding that the associations between childhood family
income and adolescent violent criminality and substance misuse
are unlikely to be causal has been suggested in prior systematic
reviews on SES and criminality.28–31 On the other hand, smaller,
US-based, quasi-experimental studies on behavioural problems
have indicated causal effects.10–12 The diverging results may have
at least two plausible explanations. First, outcome variables are
not always directly comparable between studies; whereas we have
focused on severe criminal offending and substance misuse, earlier
studies addressed less severe antisocial behaviours and conduct
problems. Second, it could be that Sweden’s comprehensive
welfare state actually mitigates the possible adverse effects of
growing up with limited material resources.32
Our results indicate therefore that prevention efforts that
specifically aim to decrease rates of violent offending and
substance misuse should target a wider range of familial risk
factors than merely parental income. This recommendation is in
line with contemporary research that defines early socioeconomic
exposures as distal risk factors because of their lack of direct
associations with delinquency and antisocial behaviours, whereas
familial risk factors (such as the quality of the parent–child
relationship, family dissolution and parental criminality) are
instead viewed as proximal risk factors because they tend to
explain the majority of the variance in such outcomes.33,34 Further
large-scale, genetically informative, quasi-experimental studies are
thus going to be crucial in identifying and determining potentially
causal familial predictors of violent criminality and substance
misuse.
Strengths and weaknesses
In the largest study of childhood SES, adolescent violent crime
and substance misuse to date (with a total population study of five
birth cohorts of children born 1989–1993), we addressed and
ruled out possible effects from various methodological weaknesses
pointed
out
previously.1,18–20,35
Measurement
error
was
minimised
by
the
use
of
well-defined,
prospectively
and
objectively gathered family income measures spanning 15 years.19
The extensive 15-year exposure period made it possible to study
potential temporal variability in effects, including both the timing
and persistence of low childhood SES.
Three methodological considerations are important when
interpreting the present findings. First, we cannot exclude
potential bias from cohort effects that might have affected the
associations between childhood family SES and outcome, because
the included cohorts were infants or preschool children when
Sweden underwent a major economic recession in the mid-1990s
with quadrupling unemployment rates and substantially rationalised
welfare programmes.36 We were unable to explore such bias
because we did not have access to yearly parental income data
prior to 1990. However, if anything, cohort effects bias may have
led to an overestimation of unadjusted effects seen before
accounting for unobserved familial risk factors.
Second, our approach of using nationwide registry data
confined our analyses to arguably more severe cases that had
been registered by the legal and clinical services for their
actions. It is obviously an empirical question whether the results
for non-diagnosed cases would be similar.
Third, the sibling-comparison design makes several important
assumptions and requires a large sample size.9,37,38 In principle,
only sibling pairs discordant on both exposure and outcome
contribute to the analyses. We identified 116 875 siblings in
56 551 families who were discordant for childhood family income
(measured in deciles). Among these discordant siblings, 3195 were

further discordant for violent criminal convictions and 5507 for
substance misuse. Although they might seem small, these sample
sizes are still larger than in most of the previous studies. Moreover,
the sibling- comparison design assumes that the results of
discordant siblings are generalisable to the total population. We
found no income differences when comparing the discordant
siblings to the total population; t(526 165) = 1.25, P= 0.21. Thus,
our findings do not seem to follow from poor statistical power,
neither does it seem that results from discordant siblings are not
generalisable.
Implications
The present study highlights the importance of adjusting for
unobserved familial risk factors when studying the impact of
childhood SES on later adverse outcomes, such as violent crime
and substance misuse; hence, claims of causal effects after only
adjusting for observed covariates should be viewed with caution.
We found strong inverse correlations that were explained fully
by unobserved familial risk factors shared by children growing
up in low SES households. Future research is needed to validate
these results in other contexts and elucidate the nature of the
mechanisms, including the relative contributions of genes and
environments.
