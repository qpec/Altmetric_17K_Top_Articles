abstract
BACKGROUND: Eggs are a good source of nutrients for growth and development. We 
hypothesized that introducing eggs early during complementary feeding would improve 
child nutrition.
METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in Cotopaxi Province, Ecuador, 
from March to December 2015. Children ages 6 to 9 months were randomly assigned to 
treatment (1 egg per day for 6 months [n = 83]) and control (no intervention [n = 80]) 
groups. Both arms received social marketing messages to encourage participation in the 
Lulun Project (lulun meaning “egg” in Kichwa). All households were visited once per week 
to monitor morbidity symptoms, distribute eggs, and monitor egg intakes (for egg group 
only). Baseline and end point outcome measures included anthropometry, dietary intake 
frequencies, and morbidity symptoms.
RESULTS: Mothers or other caregivers reported no allergic reactions to the eggs. Generalized 
linear regression modeling showed the egg intervention increased length-for-age z score 
by 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38–0.88) and weight-for-age z score by 0.61 (95% 
CI, 0.45–0.77). Log-binomial models with robust Poisson indicated a reduced prevalence of 
stunting by 47% (prevalence ratio [PR], 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37–0.77) and underweight by 74% 
(PR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.10–0.70). Children in the treatment group had higher dietary intakes of 
eggs (PR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.28–1.92) and reduced intake of sugar-sweetened foods (PR, 0.71; 
95% CI, 0.51–0.97) compared with control.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings supported our hypothesis that early introduction of eggs 
significantly improved growth in young children. Generally accessible to vulnerable groups, 
eggs have the potential to contribute to global targets to reduce stunting.

WhaT’s KnoWn on This subjecT: To our knowledge, 
no intervention trials have examined eggs during the 
complementary feeding period for growth outcomes. 
One review of other complementary foods in food-
insecure populations showed an average effect of 0.39 
height-for-age z score.
WhaT This sTudy adds: This randomized controlled 
trial showed that eggs introduced during infancy 
increased length-for-age z score by 0.63 and reduced 
stunting by 47%. There was no evidence of egg allergies. 
Eggs, generally affordable and accessible, have the 
potential to contribute to global stunting targets.

The World Health Assembly set a 
global target to reduce childhood 
stunting by 40% by 2025. If 
trends continue, we will fail to 
meet the target by an estimated 
27 million children.1 Stunting is 
a complex public health problem 
arising from poverty and other 
environmental and biological factors. 
As such, its reduction has been a 
programmatic and policy enigma 
with relatively slow progress thus 
far. The consequences of stunting 
are well established to be increased 
mortality and lost developmental 
potential.2 Certain populations are 
disproportionately affected. Our 
study focused on rural, indigenous 
populations of the Ecuadorian 
highlands where intragenerational 
stunting is evident and the 
prevalence among children <5 years 
(42.3%) exceeds the national average 
(25.2%).3, 
 
4
Interventions to address stunting 
have largely employed fortified foods 
or supplements, but limited evidence 
exists for locally available nutritious 
foods. Eggs provide >50% of 
adequate intakes for critical nutrients 
in breastfeeding infants and may also 
offer immune protection.5 They are 
more affordable than other animal-
source foods and are relatively 
simple to store and prepare. 
Evidence, primarily from upper-
income countries, suggests that eggs 
introduced during infancy neither 
increases allergy risk nor reduces 
egg sensitization.6, 
 
7 Infants living in 
a middle-to-upper income setting 
with a preexisting egg allergy may be 
more likely to experience a reaction, 
but the minimal evidence from 
resource-poor settings suggests little 
to no risk for allergic reaction.8, 
9 Our 
study aimed to test the nutritional 
efficacy of giving 1 egg per day for 6 
months to children beginning at ages 
6 to 9 months. We hypothesized that 
increased consumption of eggs would 
improve biomarkers (specifically 
choline, betaine, and vitamin B12) as 
well child growth. We report herein 
our findings on child growth and 
stunting; biomarker outcomes are 
reported in a separate publication.
MeThods
study design and Participants
We conducted a randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) with parallel 
design in 5 rural parishes of the 
Cotopaxi Province in Ecuador: 
Pastocalle, Toacaso, Guaytacama, 
Tanicuchi, and Mulalo. Cotopaxi, 
located to the south of Quito, has 
a population of ∼457 000 persons 
and is composed of the mestizo 
ethnic majority, of which ∼22% 
self-identified as indigenous in 
the last census.10 The Universidad 
San Francisco de Quito (USFQ), 
responsible for field activities, 
canvassed the catchment parishes 
to identify and recruit mother 
(caregiver)-infant pairs. Inclusion 
criteria were as follows: infant  
aged 6 to 9 months, singleton birth,  
and infant in good health. Infants 
were not included if they had a 
congenital heart condition, severe 
acute malnutrition, or egg allergy.  
If mothers were not available, other 
caregivers were enrolled. A rolling 
recruitment process was used over 
a 5-month period to ensure that 
the sample size was reached in the 
relatively low-population density 
rural region.
The study was reviewed and 
approved by ethics committees of 
USFQ, Washington University in St 
Louis, and the Pan American Health 
Organization. Written informed 
consent was obtained from mothers 
or other caregivers before baseline 
data collection was initiated.
Randomization and Masking
A block randomization procedure 
was conducted at the data collection 
sites. Potentially eligible mother 
(caregiver)-infant pairs were 
transported to data collection sites 
on the basis of geographic location. 
These groups of generally 8 to 10 
pairs were assigned randomly 
equally in a 1:1 ratio through an 
allocation concealment mechanism. 
Mothers or other caregivers were 
shown the forms labeled “alpha” 
and “beta, 
” which were then hidden, 
sealed, and placed in a container. 
Each participant then drew a form for 
group assignment. Field study team 
investigators were masked to group 
assignments with the exception 
of 1 individual responsible for 
enrolling and monitoring participants 
throughout the study. Because of 
the nature of the intervention, it 
was impossible to blind participants 
to study group assignment after 
enrollment. During the data analysis 
phase, investigators involved in 
sensitivity analyses were also 
masked to group assignment.
Procedures
The intervention consisted of 1 
medium-sized egg (∼50 g) per day, 
and the egg supply was provided 
on a weekly basis to children in the 
treatment group over a 6-month 
period. Eggs were procured from 
small-to-medium-sized poultry farms 
in the surrounding areas.
During weekly visits, mothers or 
other caregivers in the treatment 
group were reminded to give 1 egg 
per day to the index child. Members 
of the study team maintained a log 
report from their weekly visits with 
information about egg delivery, egg 
consumption by the child in the 
previous week, and any morbidities 
experienced (for example, skin rash, 
diarrhea, fever, or cough). Families 
in the control group were also visited 
every week and monitored for 
morbidities. Referrals to health care 
facilities were made when children 
were seriously ill.
USFQ, in collaboration with a local 
communication firm, developed and 
implemented a social marketing 
strategy to support the recruitment, 
reduce attrition, and promote full 
participation. A key outcome of the 
social marketing was the creation

of the project’s brand, including 
its name, the Lulun Project (lulun 
meaning “egg” in Kichwa). Other 
components included social media, 
entertainment for children at data 
collection sites, demand-driven 
workshops, and flyers and posters 
to reinforce the role of the project in 
communities. The project brand and 
activities were designed to invoke 
indigenous traditions and symbols 
while remaining meaningful for an 
international audience. The field 
team built rapport with caregivers 
by combining the abovementioned 
strategy with standardized 
techniques to explain the study 
rationale, procedures, risks, and 
benefits.
outcomes
The primary outcomes for this 
longitudinal study were improved 
anthropometric measures of child 
growth. Mixed methods were 
employed, including the collection of 
quantitative and qualitative data. At 
baseline and at end point (6 months 
after the intervention), caregiver-
child pairs were transported to 
centrally located research sites or 
were visited at the child’s household. 
Information was collected on 
socioeconomic and demographic 
variables, including water, hygiene, 
and sanitation practices and 
conditions; child morbidities; child 
diet; and child anthropometry. Child 
dietary intake was measured by 
using 24-hour recall frequency of 
dietary intake of foods commonly 
consumed in the area. This method, 
used globally in Demographic 
and Health Surveys, has been 
previously validated and was based 
on extensive formative research 
for foods commonly consumed in 
this context.11, 
 
12 Morbidities were 
assessed through 2-week recalls, 
with particular focus on diarrheal 
and respiratory conditions that are 
highly prevalent in this region and 
symptoms that might be associated 
with an egg allergy. Other morbidities 
included fever; skin rash; persistent 
cough; congestion or runny nose; 
panting, wheezing, or difficulty 
breathing; and toothache or teething.
Anthropometric measures 
were collected at baseline and 
follow-up time points according to 
international protocols.13 Before 
the start of the study, enumerators 
participated in training and 
validation exercises over a 3-day 
period. Pairs of enumerators took 2 
measures of child length by using a 
seca 417 portable infantometer (seca 
GmbH & Co KG, Hamburg, Germany) 
to the nearest 1 mm. When measures 
differed by 5 mm or more, a third 
measure was taken and averaged 
with the closest measure. Weight was 
measured by using the seca Model 
874 Electronic Digital Scale (seca 
GmbH & Co KG) with the mother-
child tare feature to the nearest 0.01 
kg. Again, 2 measures were taken 
and when they differed by 0.05 kg 
or more, a third measurement was 
taken and averaged with the other 
2 for analysis. Anthropometric 
measures were converted to z scores 
for length-for-age (LAZ), weight-for-
age (WAZ), weight-for-length (WLZ), 
and BMI (BMIz).13 Stunting was 
defined as LAZ < −2, underweight 
WAZ < −2, wasting WLZ < −2, and 
thin BMIz < −2.
statistical analysis
Our original sample size calculations 
were based on the hypothesized 
effect size (difference-in-difference 
with control) of 0.35 over the 
6-month period (α = .05 and 1−β = 
.90), a magnitude that we considered 
reasonable for micronutrient 
biomarkers on the basis of existing 
literature.14, 
 
15 We estimated that we 
would require 90 children per group, 
assuming a 20% attrition rate. This 
effect size for LAZ is comparable 
to that reported in other trials of 
complementary feeding practices.16
Intention-to-treat analyses were 
applied for all inference analyses. 
Stunting prevalence in this 
population exceeded the acceptable 
threshold for use of odds ratios 
(0.2105). Thus, prevalence ratios 
(PRs) were used to examine the egg 
effect and were considered analogous 
to relative risk in this longitudinal 
study.17 For the binomial outcomes 
of stunting and underweight, we 
estimated prevalence ratios by using 
generalized linear regression (GLM) 
modeling with robust Poisson. The 
GLM, also applied for the continuous 
outcomes, allowed for nonnormal 
distribution of parameters. Log-
binomial models using the maximum 
likelihood estimate and the logarithm 
of the probability as the link function 
were also performed, but failed to 
converge. The robust Poisson, with a 
classic sandwich estimator to correct 
the inflated variance of standard 
Poisson, is less affected by outliers.17 
Adjusted regression models 
included age and sex of the child and 
corresponding baseline measures.18 
For the morbidity symptom and 
dietary intake models, baseline 
anthropometry was tested but not 
found to be significant. Data analyses 
were performed with Stata software 
(version 13.1; StataCorp, College 
Station, TX). The trial is registered 
at clinicaltrials.gov, identifier 
NCT02446873.
ResulTs
Through a rolling recruitment 
process from February to June 2015, 
175 mother (caregiver)-infant pairs 
were assessed for eligibility. Four 
mother-infant pairs did not meet all 
the inclusion criteria, and another 
8 mothers declined to participate 
because of logistics or moving from 
the area, blood draw concerns, 
or unknown reasons (Fig 1). One 
hundred thirty eight (85%) of the 
163 enrolled and randomly assigned 
dyads were mother-infant pairs, 
whereas 25 (15%) of the enrolled 
were other caregivers, including 
grandmothers (n = 12), aunts (n = 7),  
fathers (n = 4), and sisters aged

15 and 19 years (n = 2), with no 
difference by treatment group. One 
hundred sixty-three children were 
assigned randomly to either a control 
group (n = 83) or an intervention 
group (n = 80). Losses to follow-up 
were less than originally anticipated 
(n = 11, 7% attrition). Reasons for 
losses to follow-up included refusal 
for final blood draw, temporary 
relocation, permanent relocation, and 
2 pairs with unknown reasons.
Baseline characteristics presented 
in Table 1 were comparable. Infants 
were on average 7.6 months of 
age (SD 1.1), and 66 (41%) of 160 
infants were firstborn. The mean 
age of mothers was 25.4 (SD 6.7) 
years, although 36 (23%) of 160 
mothers were <19 years of age. Out 
of the 133 reporting, 24 mothers 
(18%) indicated they were single 
(unmarried and without a partner). 
Mothers completed an average of 
9.0 (SD 3.1) years of education, 
and 73 (46%) of 160 mothers were 
employed outside the home. A large 
proportion of households were 
reported to be engaged in some form 
of food production (134 [84%] of 160 
households), with tubers being the 
predominant crop (121 [76%] of the 
households). Similarly, 135 (84%) of 
160 households reported owning and 
raising animals for food and income, 
with small animals, including guinea 
pigs and rabbits, being the most 
common (100 households, 63%). In 
addition, 93 (58%) households raised 
poultry.
We examined the effect of the egg 
intervention on child dietary intake 
by using a 24-hour frequency of 
intake of commonly consumed 
foods as one of the secondary 
outcomes (Supplemental Table 4). 
At end point, there was a significant, 
positive difference in the prevalence 
of children from the intervention 
group consuming any eggs compared 
with the control group. Both study 
arms, however, were observed to 
have increased the frequency of egg 
consumption within the previous 
24 hours (Supplemental Table 4). 
Over time, both groups reported an 
increase in consumption of sugary 
foods, drinks, and sodas. In the 
intervention group, the prevalence 
of reported consumption of sugary 
foods, such as chocolate, sweets, 
candies, pastries, cakes, or cookies, 
was 29% lower at end point when 
compared with the control group (P = 
.032). The prevalence of consumption 
of soda was also slightly (but not 
statistically significantly) lower (10% 
vs 14%, P = .137). No significant 
differences were observed for other 
food items between the intervention 
and control groups.
Baseline prevalence of stunting was 
38%, and mean LAZ was −1.90 (SD 
1.01). Children in the egg group 
showed a higher prevalence of 
stunting and underweight than the 
control group at baseline. Child 
growth outcomes were improved in 
the egg group compared with control 
group across all anthropometric 
measures (Table 2). LAZ was 
significantly increased by 0.63 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.38–0.88) at end point in the egg 
group, and prevalence of stunting 
was reduced by 47% (PR, 0.53; 95% 
CI, 0.37–0.77) after adjusting for 
child age, sex, and the corresponding 
baseline anthropometry measure. 
Other covariates, including diarrhea 
morbidities, were not found to be 
significant predictors or mediators 
of anthropometric outcomes. There 
was a shift in the distribution of LAZ 
from baseline to end point for the 
egg group only, with statistically 
significant difference-in-difference 
between groups (Fig 2). Similarly, 
WAZ was increased in the treatment 
group compared with the control 
group by 0.61 (95% CI, 0.45–0.77), 
and the prevalence of underweight 
was reduced by 74%, again adjusting 
for child age, sex of the child, and 
baseline anthropometry. Weight-
for-length and BMIzs also increased 
significantly in the treatment group 
compared with the control group.
No children developed immediate 
allergic reactions after consuming 
the eggs, as observed or reported at 
baseline, end point, or in the weekly 
monitoring visits made to households 
throughout the study period.

Respiratory symptoms of cough and 
congestion were the most commonly 
reported morbidities at both baseline 
and end point. Fever was also highly 
prevalent and not significantly 
different by group at both time 
points. The prevalence of reported 
acute diarrhea in the previous 7 
days was higher in the egg group (20 
[26%] of 78 children) compared with 
the control group (12 [15%] of 82 
children) at baseline and increased 
by 5.5% points in the egg group only, 
resulting in a significant increase in 
the PR (Table 3).
discussion
This RCT tested the simple food-
based intervention of providing 1 
egg per day for 6 months, beginning 
early in the complementary feeding 
period, compared with control or 
usual infant feeding practices. We 
found that this produced a significant 
and biologically meaningful effect 
on child growth, notably LAZ and 
reduced stunting. Effect sizes for 
the anthropometric outcomes were 
substantially greater than what 
has been previously found in other 
complementary feeding trials. 
Adjusted longitudinal analyses of 
egg compared with control groups 
showed LAZ increased by 0.63 (95% 
CI, 0.38–0.88) and stunting was 
reduced by 47% (PR, 0.53; 95% CI, 
0.37–0.77). The LAZ effect was a 
one-third or more increase in the 
global average effect size from other 
experimental trials of complementary 
foods in food-insecure populations: 
0.39 (standardized mean difference; 
95% CI, 0.05–0.73).19 Although the 
intake frequency of sugar-sweetened 
foods increased from baseline in both 
groups, there was a reduced intake 
frequency in the intervention group

compared with the control group. No 
immediate allergic reactions to egg 
consumption were observed in the 
young children from this resource-
poor setting, where the prevalence of 
food allergy is low.
Eggs are a complete food, 
safely packaged and 
arguably more accessible in 
resource-poor populations than other 
complementary foods, specifically 
fortified foods. Despite these 
features, few trials in young children 
have examined the impacts of eggs 
on child growth and development. In 
a review of the evidence, our group 
found no comparable intervention 
study in young children from 
resource-poor populations in which 
growth was a measured outcome.5 
One Australian study examined the 
effects of n-3 fatty acid–enriched 
egg yolks during the complementary 
feeding period, compared with 
regular eggs and a control group, on 
biomarker outcomes.20 Investigators 
showed an increase in erythrocyte

compared with the other groups 
and an increase in plasma iron 
and transferrin saturation in 
both egg groups when compared 
with the control group.20 Other 
studies have indirectly tested the 
nutritional effects of eggs that are 
promoted through education and 
social marketing programs and 
small livestock production.21 
– 
24 
Observational studies have linked 
eggs to child growth, including a 
recent large-scale study in India, 
which showed that lower egg 
consumption among children 0 
to 23 months doubled the odds of 
stunting.25
We hypothesized that eggs, as a 
high-quality food introduced early 
during the complementary feeding 
period, would have positive impacts 
on child growth in this population 
with marginal diets. Both egg yolk 
and egg whites contain constituents 
that might separately be linked to 
growth, although it was likely it 
was the combination of egg yolk 
and egg whites that produced the 
effect observed. Compared with 
other foods, eggs contain high 
concentrations of choline, a nutrient 
previously found to promote growth 
in animal models primarily.26 
The assemblage of amino acids 
in eggs has long been recognized 
for its quality and even applied to 
evaluate protein content in other 
foods.27 Proteins are necessary for 
muscle tissue accretion, but may 
also improve absorption kinetics 
for minerals and other essential 
nutrients.28 Finally, other bioactive 
compounds may have contributed 
to the large effect size, such as 
insulin-like growth factor 1.29 The 
preparation methods may have also 
influenced the availability of energy 
and nutrients. In our qualitative 
research (W.F.W., C.A.G.R., C.K., 
C.K.L., C.P.S., L.L.I., unpublished 
observations) we showed that 
mothers and other caregivers 
primarily offered the children soft- 
or hard-boiled eggs, though other 
cooking methods were also used, 
including frying the eggs with oil, 
preparing them as an omelet (with 
beets, broccoli, carrots, chard, or 
turnips), or adding raw eggs to soup 
or drinks. The limited variability in 
preparation, also demonstrated in 
the quantitative frequency of egg 
intake by preparation method, may 
explain why this variable was not 
found to mediate growth outcomes.
Our study carefully monitored 
allergic reactions to eggs, yet no 
incidents were observed or reported 
by caregivers during the weekly 
home visits. Egg allergies are among 
the most common immunoglobulin 
E–mediated food allergies in infants 
and young children, although 
relatively few studies have been 
conducted in resource-poor 
populations.9 Hence, despite mixed 
evidence, there is consensus that 
eggs may be introduced earlier in 
the complementary feeding period 
without risk of increased allergy 
incidence, as reflected in the revised 
guidelines of the American Academy 
of Pediatrics in 2008, among others 
globally.6, 
 
30 Concerns remain in 
Ecuador, although as a result of this 
study, the country’s Ministry of 
Health is updating its complementary 
feeding guidelines to recommend 
the introduction of eggs at 7 months. 
Our study showed no effect for 
the egg intervention on reducing 
morbidity symptoms, but there was 
an increased prevalence of reported 
acute diarrhea by the caregivers in 
the egg group. This may have been 
caused by the egg intervention, 
potentially a non-immunoglobulin E–
mediated allergy or foodborne illness 
because of improper preparation or 
handling of the eggs. However, there 
is also the possibility for some bias 
in the reporting of diarrhea, arising 
from attitudes and concerns about 
gastrointestinal problems associated 
with eggs in the diets of young 
children, as we observed in our 
qualitative research (W.F.W., C.A.G.R., 
C.K., C.K.L., C.P.S., L.L.I., unpublished 
observations). Previous studies have 
also shown inaccurate reporting 
of acute diarrhea, especially in 
breastfed children.31
Similar to many low- and middle-
income countries globally, Ecuador 
is in the throes of a nutrition and 
epidemiologic transition. The recent 
2012 Ecuadorian National Health 
and Nutrition Survey showed 8.6% 
of children to be overweight or 
obese, and 13.1% of households to 
be experiencing double the burden 
with overweight or obese mothers 
and stunted children <5 years 
old.3, 
 
4 We observed an increase in 
consumption frequency of sugary 
foods, drinks, and soda for both 
groups by end point. The egg group, 
however, showed a lower prevalence 
of consumption of sugary foods 
such as chocolates, sweets, candies, 
pastries, cakes and cookies compared 
with the control group. We did not 
provide nutrition education in this 
study beyond the social marketing 
for participation in the Lulun Project 
and compliance for egg consumption. 
High-quality foods like eggs can serve 
a vital replacement role, whether 
through calorie replacement or other 
appetite mechanisms to address 
problems of the nutrition transition 
in other parts of the world.
Some limitations in this study 
should be recognized. First, 
although the randomization process 
generated comparable groups on 
all other observed characteristics, 
there were baseline differences 
in anthropometric and reported 
diarrheal symptom measures 
between the 2 groups. There may 
have been differences in growth 
trajectories or catch-up growth 
with this variation in background 
stunting prevalence. We accounted 
for these differences by adjusting 
for baseline anthropometric 
measure in all analyses and found 
only minor reductions in the 
intervention effect size. Similarly, 
baseline morbidity symptoms were 
included in regression modeling

with little or no effects. Birth weight 
and gestational age at birth are 2 
factors that may have also influenced 
growth trajectories that were not 
tested in our study, largely because 
the information is often not known 
or recalled with accuracy. Another 
limitation may have been that the 
study was originally designed and 
powered to test the effect of an 
egg intervention on micronutrient 
biomarkers. Although the social 
marketing campaign included 
messages that encouraged mothers 
or other caregivers to give the 
egg to the index child only, we are 
aware that sharing with siblings 
may have occurred. However, if this 
occurred, it would only serve to have 
attenuated the effect size. Finally, 
although eggs are a widely available 
and accessible food source in most 
parts of the world, findings may not 
be generalizable to other contexts 
because of background stunting 
prevalence or cultural acceptability, 
although well-designed social 
marketing campaigns may overcome 
problems of acceptability.
conclusions
This RCT demonstrated that 1 egg per 
day, starting early in complementary 
feeding from 6 to 9 months and 
continuing for 6 months, significantly 
improved linear growth and reduced 
stunting in this Andean population. 
Moving forward, there is a need 
for effectiveness studies to identify 
scalable strategies to increase egg 
availability and access to vulnerable 
households and promote eggs early 
in the complementary feeding 
period in different cultural contexts. 
The efficacy of eggs might also be 
examined during pregnancy for 
impacts on fetal growth and maternal 
nutrition. In our view, eggs have the 
potential to be an affordable and 
environmentally sustainable high-
quality food source in populations 
at risk for both undernutrition and 
overweight and obesity.
