Summary
Background As Indonesia moves to provide health coverage for all citizens, understanding patterns of morbidity and 
mortality is important to allocate resources and address inequality. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 study 
(GBD 2016) estimates sources of early death and disability, which can inform policies to improve health care.
Methods We used GBD 2016 results for cause-specific deaths, years of life lost, years lived with disability, disability-
adjusted life-years (DALYs), life expectancy at birth, healthy life expectancy, and risk factors for 333 causes in Indonesia 
and in seven comparator countries. Estimates were produced by location, year, age, and sex using methods outlined 
in GBD 2016. Using the Socio-demographic Index, we generated expected values for each metric and compared these 
against observed results.
Findings In Indonesia between 1990 and 2016, life expectancy increased by 8·0 years (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 
7·3–8·8) to 71·7 years (71·0–72·3): the increase was 7·4 years (6·4–8·6) for males and 8·7 years (7·8–9·5) for 
females. Total DALYs due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes decreased by 58·6% 
(95% UI 55·6–61·6), from 43·8 million (95% UI 41·4–46·5) to 18·1 million (16·8–19·6), whereas total DALYs from 
non-communicable diseases rose. DALYs due to injuries decreased, both in crude rates and in age-standardised 
rates. The three leading causes of DALYs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and 
diabetes. Dietary risks were a leading contributor to the DALY burden, accounting for 13·6% (11·8–15·4) of DALYs 
in 2016.
Interpretation Over the past 27 years, health across many indicators has improved in Indonesia. Improvements are 
partly offset by rising deaths and a growing burden of non-communicable diseases. To maintain and increase health 
gains, further work is needed to identify successful interventions and improve health equity.

Introduction
The Republic of Indonesia (henceforth referred to as 
Indonesia), the world’s largest archipelago, consists 
of more than 17 000 islands straddling the equator, 
stretching 5200 km from east to west. Indonesia is the 
fourth most populous country and the largest Muslim-
majority nation in the world, with some 260 million 
inhabitants. More than half of all Indonesians live on 
Java, with the rest of the population distributed unevenly 
across the archipelago, presenting substantial challenges 
for governance, communication, transportation, and the 
equitable availability of basic health services.
To help to address these challenges, in 1999 the 
Indonesian Government passed law 22, initiating the 
process of decentralisation, with further legislation 
passed in 2004. In the devolved system, city and district 
heads (the mayor and regent, or bupati) were given 
primary responsibility for health care, with technical and 
financial support from the national or provincial level as 
needed. This transition has meant greater autonomy for 
local and regional heads of government to serve their 
diverse populations.
Total health expenditure in Indonesia per person has 
tripled since 2000, with private expenditure accounting 
for two thirds of all health spending, primarily for out-of-
pocket expenses.1 In 2004, growing concerns with 
productivity, equity, and the security of human capital 
led to the national adoption of a comprehensive social 
security system.2 Health coverage was scaled up almost 
immediately, with a limited programme for the poor 
initiated in 2005 and expanded in 2008, and the addition 
of coverage for antenatal and postnatal care and delivery 
services for pregnant women in 2010.
At the start of 2014, the Indonesian Government 
launched its National Social Health Insurance Scheme 
(known as the Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional, or JKN), 
which aims to provide health coverage for all Indonesians, 
with the government paying the modest premiums

of the poor and near poor.3 For the population whose 
premium is covered by the government, enrolment in 
the programme has increased from 86·4 million people 
in 2014 to 111·6 million in November, 2017 (with 
92·2 million people funded at the national level and 
19·4 million at the local level).4 The government has 
set 2019 as its target for the enrolment of 95% of the 
population—the functional achievement of universal 
health care.5
By July 1, 2017, JKN had contracts with 26 000 health 
facilities and providers across Indonesia’s 34 provinces, 
serving 180·7 million total members—68% of Indonesia’s 
total population. More than 57 trillion Indonesian Rupiah 
(US$4·8 billion) have been spent to serve 100 million 
outpatient episodes and 40 million inpatients.6 The JKN 
emphasises primary care and improved procurement, 
distribution, and utilisation of key medicines. Its main 
objectives include increasing equity in access to health 
care, improving health outcomes, and keeping health-
care costs down.7
Efforts to achieve universal health care, particularly in 
poorer and isolated areas, will require effective health 
promotion and the extension of quality health care to all 
Indonesians.1,2,8,9 Given the diverse range of geography 
and economic status across the country, regular com-
prehensive assessment of disparities in morbidity, 
mortality, and disability patterns and their causes is 
needed. In this Article, we use the results of the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) 
Study 2016 to examine Indonesia’s health transition from 
1990 to 2016 against comparator nations. The GBD study 
makes domestic and international comparison possible 
and provides valuable additional data and perspective 
in examining the nation’s health status. The results of 
our study will help to identify gaps and develop national-
level responses that can support subnational leaders 
and managers to improve the availability, accessibility, 
appropriateness, quality, and equity of health care.
This Article will serve as an important reference point 
for a subnational study anticipated later in 2018. The 
analysis will also form part of an increasing body of work 
of the GBD collaborator teams with a strong local interest 
in producing results and evidence that directly serve 
policy needs.10–14 Collaborators have further produced a 
series of subnational estimates in 12 countries, allowing 
local policy makers to set priorities and track changes 
at finer administrative levels.15–18 Here, we present the 
first comprehensive national-level assessment of the 
burden of disease in Indonesia to delineate prominent 
health challenges on the nation’s journey to universal 
health care.
Methods
Overview
For this analysis, Indonesia-specific estimates of life 
expectancy at birth, healthy life expectancy (HALE), cause-
specific mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years of life 
lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs), and related risk factors are reported along 
with national estimates from seven comparator countries 
to facilitate comparison and benchmarking between 
1990 and 2016. Brazil, India, Malaysia, the Philippines,

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Routinely collected health statistics from Indonesia have 
informed previous Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies, 
which, in 2016, estimated health loss for 333 causes of death 
and disability and 84 risk factors in 195 locations from 
1990 to 2016. Since 1990, Indonesia has completed many 
nationally representative surveys and censuses; the GBD studies 
include these and other data subjected to rigorous inclusion 
criteria in the estimation process. Yet, outside of the GBD 
studies, health data in Indonesia are infrequently aggregated in 
a systematic manner, and the full range of diseases, injuries, 
and risk factors is not consistently captured. Because of the 
country’s size, diversity, and widespread socioeconomic 
disparities, the comprehensive analytic framework of the GBD 
studies can yield improved population health measurement.
Added value of this study
This analysis represents the largest systematic effort to date to 
quantify levels and long-term trends in mortality, disability, and 
risk-attributable burden of diseases and injuries in Indonesia. 
The GBD 2016 study allows for comprehensive comparisons 
across time and between comparator countries, providing new 
insights into health trends and identifying areas meriting 
heightened policy attention. GBD 2016 made substantial 
methodological improvements from GBD 2015, and included 
estimates for an additional 21 causes of death and disability. 
Our study comes at a crucial time for benchmarking and priority 
setting for health spending and programme development in 
Indonesia, as the country moves towards implementing 
universal health care by 2019.
Implications of all the available evidence
Health in Indonesia has substantially improved since 1990. 
However, these improvements have not been homogeneous and 
a double burden of communicable and non-communicable 
disease is placing increasing strain on the nation’s health system 
and consequently its ambitious efforts to achieve universal health 
care. Data reflecting regional differences are needed to target 
improvements to specific areas that are lagging behind or have 
distinctive challenges. In tandem with more integrated models of 
service delivery, an emphasis on the early detection and 
prevention of non-communicable diseases and risk factors might 
help to alter the course of Indonesia’s growing epidemic of non-
communicable diseases and related disability. In particular, high 
levels of tobacco smoking threaten to undermine progress and 
increase already high rates of tobacco-related death and disability.

Figure 1: Attribution of 
changes in life expectancy at 
birth to changes in major 
groups of causes of death for 
Indonesia and comparator 
countries, 1990–2016, by sex
Changes are shown for 
Indonesia and comparator 
countries for both sexes, 
males, and females. Locations 
are ordered by life expectancy 
at birth in 2016, from highest 
to lowest. Purple lines show 
life expectancy at birth 
in 1990, and black lines show 
life expectancy at birth 
in 2016; for all countries 
except the Philippines, these 
lie at the beginning and end of 
each bar, respectively. *In 
the Philippines, the increase in 
life expectancy attributable to 
changes in injuries and 
communicable, maternal, 
neonatal, and nutritional 
causes was countered by a 
decrease in life expectancy 
attributable to 
non-communicable diseases, 
leading to a smaller net 
increase in life expectancy 
than the overall change.

Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam were chosen as comparator 
countries on the basis of their geographical proximity, 
similar sociodemographic levels, or the presence of 
Muslim majority in the population.
This study complies with the Guidelines for Accurate 
and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting, shown in 
the appendix (pp 2–6).18 Additional information on all 
data sources used in GBD 2016 can be found on the 
Global Health Data Exchange website. GBD 2016 results 
for all years and locations can be explored further with 
dynamic data visualisations.
Mortality
Cause-specific mortality was estimated for each age, sex, 
location, and year. Data were evaluated for completeness 
and misclassification, and cleaned, disaggregated, and 
mapped to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 
codes. Deaths with non-specific or impossible codes, 
termed garbage codes, were redistributed to appropriate 
ICD codes by level in the GBD hierarchy prior to modelling. 
A complete list of data used to generate mortality estimates 
for Indonesia can be found in the appendix (pp 7–15). The 
most commonly used estimation method for cause-
specific mortality was cause of death ensemble modelling 
using the GBD cause of death database.19 This process is 
explained in more detail in the appendix (p 16). YLLs were 
computed by multiplying the number of deaths in each 
age group by a reference life expectancy from analyses of 
all-cause mortality.
Morbidity
For each combination of age, sex, year, and location, most 
prevalence and incidence estimates were generated using 
Bayesian meta-regression methods (DisMod-MR 2.1, 
as described in the appendix, p 16), with cause-specific 
exceptions outlined in other publications.20,21 YLDs were 
subsequently calculated by taking into account disease 
severity, exclusivity, and comorbidity; further details on 
the calculation can be found in the appendix (p 16).21
Life expectancy, HALE, and DALYs
The calculation of standard life expectancy at birth 
and for specific age groups was done using the world 
population age standard.22 HALE at birth and in specific 
age groups was calculated using YLD estimates and GBD 
life tables on the basis of methods originally developed 
by Sullivan.23,24 DALYs were calculated by summing YLLs 
and YLDs.
Risk factor estimation
Minimum risk level, exposure, risk, and attributable 
burden due to 84 behavioural, environmental and occu-
pational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks were 
estimated using the GBD comparative risk assessment 
framework.25 The attributable burden for each risk-out-
come pair was calculated as the total deaths or YLLs 
multiplied by the population attributable fraction.
Uncertainty levels
Uncertainty levels were propagated at multiple stages 
throughout the GBD modelling process.26 Uncertainty for 
mortality and YLLs reflected uncertainty in the levels of all-
cause mortality and in the estimation of each mortality 
cause, in each age group, sex, and year. Uncertainty in 
the disability weight for each sequela was propagated into 
the estimates of YLDs for each disease and injury. A

The difference in trends between total DALYs and crude DALY rates is caused by population growth, and the difference between crude and age-standardised rates is 
caused by changes in the percentage distribution of the population by age. Shaded areas show 95% uncertainty intervals. DALYs=disability-adjusted life-years.

sample of 1000 draws was taken from the posterior 
distribution of each estimation step; aggregation of uncer-
tainty across age, sex, and location was done on each draw, 
assuming independence of uncertainty. The lower and 
upper uncertainty intervals (UIs) represent the ordinal 
25th and 975th draws of each quantity and attempt to 
describe modelling as well as sampling error.
Socio-demographic Index and expected mortality 
analysis
The Socio-demographic Index (SDI) is a summary 
measure that takes total fertility rate, mean education 
for those aged 15 and older, and lag-distributed income 
per person, and computes the geometric mean of these 
three measures for each location (appendix p 17).27 The 
SDI for Indonesia in 2016 was 0·676. SDI was used to 
calculate expected mortality rates and YLDs by using 
Gaussian process regression with a linear prior for the 
mean function for each age-sex group. We compared 
these values with the observed values to identify locations 
and causes for which improvements were greater or less 
than anticipated on the basis of SDI alone.

Figure 3: Leading 30 Level-3 causes of DALYs in Indonesia for 1990, 2006, and 2016, with percentage change in number of DALYs and all-age and age-standardised DALY rates
Causes of DALYs for both sexes combined are ordered by total DALYs and are connected by arrows between time periods. For the time periods 1990–2006 and 2006–16, three measures of change are 
shown: median percent change in the number of DALYs, median percent change in the all-age DALY rate, and median percent change in the age-standardised DALY rate. Median values across 
the 1000 draws from the uncertainty distribution are shown. Numbers in bold are statistically significant (α=0·05). DALYs=disability-adjusted life-years. COPD=chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
STDs=sexually transmitted diseases. Cirrhosis/other liver disease=cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases. Intestinal infectious=other intestinal infectious diseases.

Results
Between 1990 and 2016, life expectancy at birth in 
Indonesia increased by 8·0 years (95% UI 7·3–8·8), 
from 63·6 years (63·2–64·0) to 71·7 years (71·0–72·3; 
figure 1). Life expectancy at birth for males increased by 
7·4 years (6·4–8·6), from 62·4 years (61·8–62·9) to 
69·8 years (68·8–70·7), whereas life expectancy at birth 
for females increased by 8·7 years (7·8–9·5), from 
64·9 years (64·3–65·4) to 73·6 years (73·0–74·1; figure 1).
For the same period, life expectancy at birth increased 
across the comparator countries on average by 6·6 years 
for both sexes, ranging from 9·6 years (95% UI 8·8–10·3) 
in India (from 59·0 years [58·5–59·4] to 68·6 years 
[67·9–69·1]) to 3·1 years (1·6–4·6) in the Philippines 
(from 67·0 years [66·4–67·7] to 70·1 years [68·7–71·5]).
Between 1990 and 2016, Indonesia experienced a 
substantial decline in diseases due to communicable, 
maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) causes: total 
CMNN DALYs declined by 58·6% (95% UI 55·6–61·6) 
from 43·8 million (95% UI 41·4–46·5) to 18·1 million 
(16·8–19·6). All-age rates and total CMNN DALYs dipped 
below those of NCDs in 1996, whereas total NCD DALYs 
rose substantially (figure 2). Age-standardised rates for 
CMNN DALYs also decreased substantially (by 65·9% 
[63·2–68·4]) from 1990 to 2016 (from 22·7 thousand 
[21·2–24·3] to 7·74 thousand [7·15–8·36]), whereas age-
standardised rates for NCD DALYs remained stable across 
most of the study period but declined slightly from 
2010 to 2016 (by 4·4% [2·6–6·2], from 24·1 thousand 
[21·7–26·6] to 23·1 thousand [20·7–25·6]). Total DALYs 
from injuries remained fairly stable across the study 
period, with the exception of the spike in 2004 
corresponding to the Indian Ocean earthquake and 
tsunami. A substantial reduction was observed in crude 
rates (32·5% [23·5–39·0], from 3·33 thousand [2·94–3·70] 
to 2·25 thousand [2·04–2·50]), and in age-standardised 
rates (31·4% [23·4–37·2], from 3·40 thousand [3·01–3·75] 
to 2·33 thousand [2·12–2·59]). 
In 1990, six of the ten leading causes of DALYs were 
CMNN conditions, which decreased to three of ten in 2016. 
Diarrhoeal diseases dropped from the number one cause 
of DALYs in 1990 to the fifth in 2006 (a total DALY reduction 
of 63·6% [95% UI 57·4–68·6], from 9·52 million [95% UI 
7·39–11·9] to 3·45 million [2·72–4·27]), and dropped an 
additional 43·3% (29·1–52·0) from 2006 to 2016 to the 
tenth leading cause (1·95 million [1·48–2·51] total DALYs; 
figure 3). Lower respiratory infections likewise dropped 
from the second leading cause in 1990 to the 11th in 2016, 
representing a decrease of 74·4% (69·8–78·7) in total 
DALYs from 6·89 million (5·83–8·04) to 1·75 million 
(1·57–1·96). Tuberculosis remained among the leading 
causes of DALYs, moving from third in 1990 to second 
in 2006 (decrease in total DALYs of 26·4% [20·7–32·2], 
from 5·77 million [5·26–6·35] to 4·23 million [4·02–4·47]), 
and fourth in 2016 (decrease of 28·5% [24·0–32·4] to 
3·03 million [2·84–3·23]). Neonatal preterm birth 
complications showed less dramatic reductions, moving 
from the fourth leading cause in 1990 to the sixth in 2006 
(decrease of 18·2% [3·6–31·5], from 4·17 million 
[3·40–5·48] to 3·38 million [3·02–4·00], and remaining 
at sixth in 2016 (decrease of 33·2% [24·2–40·9], to 
2·52 million [1·99–2·61]).
Non-communicable diseases comprised six of the 
leading ten causes of DALYs in 2016, compared with 
three in 1990 (figure 3). Ischaemic heart disease became 
the leading cause in 2006, with the total number of 
DALYs increasing by 57·3% (95% UI 44·5 to 70·0) 
between 1990 (3·76 million [95% UI 3·41 to 4·20]) and 
2006 (5·90 million [5·63 to 6·22]). It remained the 
leading cause in 2016, having increased an additional 
10·5% (5·43 to 16·3) between 2006 and 2016 to 
6·52 million (6·18 to 6·88). DALYs from cerebrovascular 
disease also increased substantially between 1990 and 
2006 (by 55·4% [46·3 to 66·3], from 2·56 million 
[2·37 to 2·75] to 3·98 million [3·80 to 4·17]) and 2006 
and 2016 (by 30·2% [24·3 to 36·1], to 5·18 million 
[4·89 to 5·49]), rising from the eighth leading cause in 
1990 to the second in 2016. Despite large increases 
in total DALYs, age-standardised rates for these 
conditions have remained stable; from 2006 to 2016, 
age-standardised rates of cerebrovascular disease 
increased by just 1·2% (−3·4 to 5·8) from 2·75 thousand 
(2·61 to 2·90) to 2·78 thousand (2·62 to 2·96), 
whereas age-standardised rates of ischaemic heart

disease dropped by 14·8% (10·3 to 18·7), from 4·03 
thousand (3·83 to 4·25) to 3·43 thousand (3·24 to 3·62). 
The exception to this pattern is diabetes, for which the 
number of DALYs increased between 2006 and 2016 by 
54·9% (48·8 to 61·0), from 2·16 million (1·93 to 2·44) 
to 3·35 million (2·97 to 3·80), and age-standardised 
rates increased by 17·6% (12·8 to 22·4), from 
1·35 thousand (1·21 to 1·50) to 1·58 thousand 
(1·41 to 1·77), making it the third leading cause of 
DALYs in 2016.
Road injuries moved from the ninth leading cause of 
DALYs in 1990 and 2006 to the eighth in 2016 (figure 3). 
Although the total number of DALYs from road injuries 
decreased over both time periods, they remain a leading 
cause of death and disability. Of the top causes of DALYs 
in 2016, road injuries and falls were the only injury-
related causes to make the list.
When ranking risk factors by the number of age-
standardised DALYs they contribute to in Indonesia and 
comparator countries in 2016, we found that the leading 
four risk factors in Indonesia also tended to be in the top 
three or four positions in comparator countries, showing a 
similar profile of health challenges (figure 4). The leading 
risk factor in Indonesia, high systolic blood pressure, ranks 
among the leading three causes in all comparator countries 
except India and Thailand (figure 4). Dietary risks are 
among the top five risk factors for all comparators, whereas 
high fasting plasma glucose is ranked higher in Indonesia 
than in the rest of the comparators (figure 4). Although 
tobacco is the fourth leading risk factor in Indonesia, it is 
among the top three risks in all comparators except Brazil 
and India (figure 4). Child and maternal malnutrition is 
ranked fifth in Indonesia, higher than in all the other 
comparator countries except India (figure 4).
The ratio of observed YLLs and the number of YLLs 
that would be expected on the basis of SDI alone 
increased in Indonesia between 1990 and 2016 for 
six of the ten leading causes of death (figure 5). The ratio 
for most leading causes of mortality in Indonesia 
was between 0·5 and 4·0, with the notable exceptions of 
diarrhoeal 
diseases 
and 
tuberculosis 
(figure 
5). 
Three ratios decreased from 1990 to 2016: neonatal 
preterm birth complications, lower respiratory infections, 
and road injuries (figure 5). Similar patterns were seen 
among comparator countries: all comparators except 
Thailand and Turkey experienced an increase in the ratio 
for tuberculosis, although none resulting in a 2016 ratio 
as high as that of Indonesia (the closest being the 
Philippines; figure 5). Indonesia also had notably high 
and increasing ratios for diarrhoeal disease (figure 5).
Dietary risks account for the highest number of DALYs 
(13·6% [95% UI 11·8–15·4]) in Indonesia, contributing 
substantially to the burden of cardio 
vascular disease 
(11·3% [9·7–12·8]); diabetes, urogenital, blood, and 
endocrine diseases (2·0% [1·5–2·6]); and, to a lesser 
degree, neoplasms (0·3% [0·2–0·4]; figure 6). High 
systolic blood pressure is the second leading risk factor, 
accounting for 13·4% (12·0–15·0) of DALYs and 
contributing principally to the burden of cardiovascular 
disease (12·5% [11·2–14·0]) and diabetes, urogenital, 
blood, and endocrine diseases (0·9% [0·8–1·1]). High 
fasting plasma glucose contributes to the third highest 
number of DALYs (10·1% [8·8–11·7]), including diabetes, 
urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases (5·8% 
[5·5–6·1]); cardiovascular disease (3·6% [2·5–5·1]); and 
HIV
/AIDS and tuberculosis (0·4% [0·3–0·6]). Other 
leading risk factors include tobacco, which caused 
9·5% (8·6–10·6) of total DALYs, and child and maternal 
malnutrition, which contributed to 9·5% (8·7–10·7) of 
total DALYs. High body-mass index (7·2% [4· 7–9·9]), 
occupational risks (5·3% [4·9–5·7]), and air pollution 
(5·2% [4·6–5·9]) also contributed to a substantial portion 
of DALYs in 2016.

now of working age and the population aged 60 years and 
older is growing, projected to make up 12% of the 
population by 2025 and 16% by 2035.28 Maintaining 
quality of life for older Indonesians promises to be a 
growing challenge, with more than 25% of this age group 
already reporting at least one form of disability.29
At the same time, Indonesia must grapple with mixed 
and changing patterns of morbidity, mortality, and 
disability. These are further complicated by the size of the 
country, its diversity of urban and rural environments, 
varied levels of socioeconomic development, and a 
growing number of metropolitan conglomerations. The 
epidemiological transition has produced a double burden 
of disease in Indonesia, with the simultaneous increase 
of NCDs such as diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, 
and ischaemic heart disease, while CMNN causes such 
as tuberculosis, diarrhoea, and HIV
/AIDS persist as 
substantial problems.
Based on comparisons between Indonesia and com-
parator nations, there is clearly potential for sub 
stantial 
improvements to health in Indonesia. Tuberculosis, 
neonatal preterm birth complications, diarrhoea, and 
lower respiratory tract infections are still substantial 
contributors to DALYs, and the rise in NCDs—especially 
ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and 
diabetes—needs increased attention.30 Diversity in treat-
ment costs increases the complexity of addressing this 
double burden of disease. Road injuries, which cause the 
bulk of Indonesia’s injury DALY burden, also present a 
substantial challenge. Improving personal and commercial 
transportation has been a high priority, yet increasing 
connectivity and safety demand ongoing attention from 
multiple branches of government.
The leading three risk factors for premature mortality—
high systolic blood pressure, dietary risks, and high 
fasting plasma glucose—have an aetiological component 
that is directly or indirectly associated with diet and 
lifestyle. A 2015 analysis31 of the burden of malnutrition in 
Indonesia found a high prevalence of both under 
nutrition 
and overnutrition concentrated in specific clusters. In 
particular, the recent sharp rise of diabetes will continue 
to strain the health system. In response to these risks, the 
Indonesian Government has increased promotion and 
prevention measures, including Presidential Decree No. 1 
(2017),32 to encourage healthy lifestyles, focusing on 
physical activity, healthy diet, and early detection of health 
problems. Additional reduction efforts through public 
health campaigns, taxation, and further legislation are 
required to ensure that the burden of these preventable 
risk factors does not continue to rise.
Ischaemic heart disease and haemorrhagic stroke are 
Indonesia’s first and second leading causes of premature 
mortality. The dominant position of these causes reflects 
high levels of systolic blood pressure and smoking, 
which are major determinants of these conditions. Age-
standardised DALY rates attributable to elevated systolic 
blood pressure in Indonesia were among the highest in 
the world in 2016, and the highest found outside of 
eastern and central Europe. DALY rates attributable to 
tobacco smoking were similarly high. These risks are 
particularly concerning in light of increasing numbers 
of incident stroke and myocardial infarctions, driven in 
large part by population growth and population ageing.
Tobacco is currently the fourth leading risk factor for 
premature death and disability in Indonesia, which also 
has the world’s highest daily smoking rates for males: 
in 2016, more than half of males older than 10 years smoked 
daily.25 Although smoking rates among females are much 
lower, two thirds of Indonesian women are regularly 
exposed to second-hand smoke.25 Nonetheless, tobacco 
control remains highly contentious within the country, and 
Indonesia has yet to sign the WHO Framework Convention 
on Tobacco Control—the only country in Asia and one of 
only nine worldwide not to do so.33
Indonesian men and women differ in their health 
status in other ways as well: women had higher life 
expectancy at birth than did men and made greater gains 
in life expectancy from 1990 to 2016. The increase in life 
expectancy at birth in Indonesia was primarily due to 
reductions in CMNN diseases, although this proportion 
is higher in Indonesian males than in females, for whom 
a reduction in NCD causes contributed substantially 
more to increasing life expectancy at birth. Although 
diet-related risk factors were important for both sexes, 
smoking contributed to nearly the same percentage 
of DALYs in 2016 as did dietary risks for men, but 
contributed to a much smaller percentage of DALYs 
for women. These variances can guide targeted health 
interventions for both sexes.
Indonesia has 180·7 million people insured through 
JKN—approximately 70% of the population. Its target is to 
reach 95% enrolment in 2019.34 This programme will be 
key to sustaining health improvements, especially with 
appropriate actions to monitor, evaluate, and address wide-
spread socioeconomic disparities in the supply and 
demand sides of the health system. Although increased 
government health spending and projected changes in 
JKN financing (from out-of-pocket to pooled resources) 
might positively impact inequality, concerns remain that 
too large a proportion of JKN funds have been directed to 
secondary-level services (ie, hospitalisation) and too little to 
preventive and primary care.35
The programme faces many challenges, including the 
complexity of devolved systems and the need for infra-
structure improvement and human resources, alongside 
the paramount importance of maintaining support 
for primary health care. In addition, the health system 
must be able to respond to changing demand due to 
epidemiological shifts and diminishing financial barriers 
as a result of JKN. Ensuring that JKN is strong and 
sustainable is crucial to achieving universal health care 
in Indonesia.36,37

indicator 
of 
achieving 
universal 
coverage 
(SDG 
indicator 3.8) on a scale of 0–100, places Indonesia at 39.37 
Indonesia’s score shows that great progress remains to 
be made on service coverage. The country is expected to 
continue to improve substantially, with a projected index 
rating of 56 by 2030.
This Article is subject to all the limitations of the GBD 
methodology, which have been comprehensively described 
elsewhere.21,22,25,26,37,38 Insufficiently compre 
hensive vital 
registration data is a challenge for many of the locations 
included in the GBD, and Indonesia is no exception. Most 
of the results presented for Indonesia come from regional 
patterns and covariates, with few datapoints available to 
guide estimation. Results could be strengthened by efforts 
to systematically fill this data gap. The move towards 
subnational GBD estimates is a key next step for Indonesia 
and will be uniquely important owing to the country’s 
marked geographical, demo 
graphic, and cultural diversity, 
as well as the federated provincial-level authority in the 
health system. Additional urban–rural stratification of 
results will be highly beneficial both in terms of 
understanding disparities and directing appropriate 
health policy and programmes, and is particularly needed 
to target isolated populations living on the many small 
islands of Indonesia.
In conclusion, Indonesia has increased life expectancy 
at birth by 8 years since 1990, primarily through reductions 
in CMNN diseases. The archipelago is experiencing a 
double burden of disease at the national level: although 
changing lifestyles have rapidly increased prevalence of 
NCDs, there is still a large burden from CMNN diseases. 
The cost of health-care provision has risen sharply, and 
with it the cost and difficulty of reaching universal health 
care. This baseline study provides a better understanding 
of what risks remain to be targeted and the available 
opportunities for improvement. Given Indonesia’s geo-
graphical and socioeconomic diversity, we will probably 
continue to see very diverse patterns of health and burden 
of disease across the country. Subnational estimates of the 
burden of disease will be particularly valuable in tailoring 
health priorities and programmes to the needs of specific 
provinces. The political commitment to the ongoing 
subnational GBD exercise is prudent and will increase the 
value of these metrics for both public health planning and 
assessment of progress over time.
