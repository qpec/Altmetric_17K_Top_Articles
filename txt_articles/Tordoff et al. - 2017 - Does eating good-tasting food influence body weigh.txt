Abstract
Does eating good-tasting food influence body weight? To investigate, we first established some 
concentrations of sucralose and mineral oil in chow that mice strongly preferred. Then, in 
Experiment 1, we compared groups of 16 mice fed plain chow (i.e., chow with no additives) to 
groups fed chow with added (a) sucralose, (b) mineral oil, (c) sucralose and mineral oil, or (d) 
sucralose on odd days and mineral oil on even days. During a 6-week test, the body weights and 
body compositions of the five groups never differed. In Experiment 2, we compared groups of 18 
mice fed plain chow or plain high-fat diet to groups fed these diets with added sucralose. During a 
9-week test, the high-fat diet caused weight gain, but the body weights of mice fed the sucralose-
sweetened diets did not differ from those fed the corresponding plain versions. Two-cup choice 
tests conducted at the end of each experiment showed persisting strong preferences for the diets 
with added sucralose and/or mineral oil. In concert with earlier work, our results challenge the 
hypothesis that the orosensory properties of a food influence body weight gain. A good taste can 
stimulate food intake acutely, and guide selection toward nutrient-dense foods that cause weight 
gain, but it does not determine how much is eaten chronically.

There is a common adage that “if it tastes good, it must be bad for you,” implying that good-
tasting foods cause obesity and related health problems. However, empirical support for this 
is weak, at best. Work often cited as evidence that body weight is influenced by “good taste” 
(used here in the general sense, to include flavor and texture) involves feeding rats 
combinations of tasty foods, sometimes for several weeks, but these studies confound food 
taste with variety and/or macronutrient content [e.g., (19,31,43); reviewed in (22)]. In fact, 
we know of only three investigations where food taste was independently manipulated and 
body weight monitored.
First, Wene et al. (41) reported that baboons gained weight when they were fed chow with a 
preferred flavor (first punch flavor, then orange flavor) for 9 weeks. However, this study

 involved only three subjects and had no control group, so the effects attributed to good taste 
may have been due to experience, including age. Moreover, the increase in body weight 
reported as significant—“t(2) = 2.76, p = 0.055”—is actually nonsignificant using the 
standard criterion, even with a one-tailed t-test.
Second, Ramirez (29) found that rats gained significantly more weight if fed a saccharin-
sweetened wet diet than an unsweetened wet diet. However, contrary to an explanation based 
on the saccharin taste causing hyperphagia and weight gain, (a) there was a latent period of 
several days between first giving the saccharin-containing food and the onset of 
hyperphagia, (b) the effect was present only with a diet containing 80% water and not one 
containing 60% water, (c) the effect was absent in rats given previous experience consuming 
saccharin, and (d) more generally, nonnutritive sweeteners do not increase food intake when 
mixed into food [e.g., (15,24,37)], or when provided as a separate taste solution [e.g., (28)]. 
Swithers and colleagues have argued that saccharin can cause weight gain by disrupting the 
normal relationship between sweet taste and its anticipated physiological outcome (38,39), 
but recent work undermines the evidence for this (7). Certainly, interpreting any effects of 
nonnutritive sweetener ingestion as due to “good taste” is complicated by the potential 
contribution of sweet receptors in the gut and pancreas [e.g., (18,20); review (13)], and by 
the action of nonnutritive sweeteners on gut bacteria that influence metabolism [reviews 
(27,34)].
Third, Naim et al. (25,26) compared groups of 12–15 rats fed plain diet for 23 days with 
others exposed to a “cafeteria-variety” condition, involving concurrent access to three foods, 
each with a different preferred flavor (25) presented in three different food textures, and with 
the three foods switched twice daily for another three preferred-flavor foods. This 
experiment was conducted first with the flavors embedded in AIN-76A diet (a nutritionally 
complete moderate-energy density diet) and then in a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. In 
each case, there were no differences in food intake or body weight between rats in the plain 
diet and cafeteria-variety conditions.
The work by Naim et al. (26) is meticulous but not without problems. One is that the 
treatment condition confounded good taste with variety, so even if the results had been 
positive it would not be possible to attribute any effects to “good taste” alone. Another is that 
rats fed plain AIN-76A diet and those fed plain high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet had similar 
body weights. This seems awry because there are many demonstrations that feeding high-fat, 
high-carbohydrate diet promotes obesity. It raises the specter of a technical error, perhaps 
with diet formulation, or perhaps the twice-daily commotion associated with weighing and 
changing dozens of food cups disturbed the rats' normal feeding patterns in a manner that 
compromised body weight gains.
Given these limitations, the tremendous importance of taste for the enjoyment of food, and 
the substantial funds spent by the food industry to improve the chemosensory attributes of 
their products, we thought it worthwhile to revisit the issue. One problem with the work of 
Naim et al. is that proprietary flavors were used, making a direct replication difficult. It has 
also been suggested that the flavors may not have been as strongly liked as are the flavors of 
typical high-macronutrient density foods. To avoid these potential problems, here we

 manipulated diet acceptability with sucralose, a nonnutritive sweetener, and mineral oil, a 
nonnutritive oily “taste.” First, in an initial pretest, we established concentrations of 
sucralose and mineral oil in chow that C57BL/6J mice strongly preferred in two-cup choice 
tests. Then, in Experiment 1, we compared the body weights and compositions of mice fed 
plain chow with those fed chow containing various combinations of added sucralose and/or 
mineral oil. Finally, in Experiment 2, we compared the body weights and compositions of 
mice fed chow or a high-fat diet with those fed the same diets containing added sucralose.
METHODS AND RESULTS
General methods
Subjects, maintenance, and diets—Subjects were naïve male C57BL/6J mice, 
purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine). The mice were 10 – 12 weeks 
old when they arrived in our facility. They were individually housed in plastic “tub” cages 
(26.5 cm × 17 cm × 12 cm) with stainless steel grid lids, and wood shavings scattered on the 
floor. The vivarium was maintained at 23°C on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle, with lights off at 
1800 h. The mice had deionized water to drink from a glass bottle with a stainless steel 
sipper tube, and they were fed Teklad 8604 chow. This is a cereal-based diet manufactured 
by Harlan (Madison, WI), with an energy density of 13 kJ/g (3.1 kcal/g), derived from 30% 
protein, 58% carbohydrate, and 12% fat. The diet was provided as pellets while the mice 
acclimated to our vivarium, and as a powder during experiments. The powder was presented 
in a glass jar (1-oz capacity; U-line, no. S-17073P). To reduce food spillage, this was held 
upright in the center of a 3” (7.6-cm) diameter acrylic disk (U.S. Plastics Corp., no. 44185) 
by three clear 8–32” × 7/8” screw fasteners (U.S. Plastics Corp., no. 32016).
Sucralose (Sigma-Aldrich., no. 69293) and mineral oil (CVS Health, Woonsocket, RI) were 
mixed into the chow using a commercial-grade food mixer. For Experiment 2, some mice 
were fed a “Corbit and Stellar” high-fat diet [(9) ~21 kJ/g (5.1 kcal/g)]. This was made by 
heating on a hotplate a glass beaker containing a weighed quantity of vegetable shortening 
(Crisco brand; J.M. Smucker Co.) until liquid, then removing it from the heat and stirring in 
2 grams of Teklad 8604 chow (with sucralose, if needed) for each gram of vegetable 
shortening. Spoonfuls of the mixture were then scooped into glass feeding jars, and allowed 
to cool and solidify.
Measurement of body weight and composition—At the beginning and end of each 
experiment, and weekly in Experiments 1 and 2, mice were weighed by placing them on a 
top-loading balance with 0.1-g precision. In Experiments 1 and 2, body composition was 
assessed every 3 weeks. Each mouse was carried to an adjacent room housing a Bruker 
Minispec LF110; the mouse was placed into a plastic restraining tube, and then inserted into 
the core of the machine for ~90 sec while its body composition was assessed by magnetic 
resonance technology. The mouse was then returned to its home cage. However, a technical 
fault with the Minispec invalidated several body composition values, so here we provide 
only those measurements collected at the end of the experiments.
Two-cup choice tests—In each experiment, 48- or 96-h two-cup choice tests were used 
to assess preferences for diets containing sucralose and/or mineral oil. At the beginning of

 each two-cup choice test and then at 48 h and 96 h, the food jars were weighed with 0.1-g 
precision. Spillage was collected and accounted for. The positions of the two jars were 
switched every 24 h to control for side preferences (2).
The food eaten from each cup was calculated by subtracting the weight of the food 
remaining at the end of each 48-h period from the weight of food given (corrected for 
spillage). Preference scores for the sucralose or mineral oil were calculated based on the 
formula: preference score = intake of food with additive/total intake of food from both cups 
× 100.
Pretest
Methods—The pretest to establish some highly preferred concentrations of sucralose and 
mineral oil was conducted with two groups of 12 mice weighing (mean ± SE) 23.3 ± 0.3 g 
(range; 21.7 – 25.4 g). The mice received six 48-h two-cup choice tests. For both groups, the 
first test involved a choice between two cups of plain diet. Then, one group received a choice 
between chow and ascending concentrations of sucralose [0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4% wt/wt (i.e., 
g sucralose/100 g diet)]; the other received a choice between chow and ascending 
concentrations of mineral oil (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16% wt/wt). Fresh cups of plain chow were 
introduced every 48 h, at the same time that fresh chow containing a new concentration of 
sucralose or mineral oil was introduced.
One mouse in two 48-h tests involving sucralose, and one mouse in one 48-h test involving 
sucralose, contaminated its plain food with feces to an extent that we could not make 
accurate weight measurements. Values for these three tests were interpolated, so as to 
simplify statistical analyses.
Results—Preference scores for chow containing 0.25, 0.5, 1 or 2% sucralose were 100%, 
or very close to it; that is, the mice ate almost all their food from the cup containing the 
sweetened chow. Preference scores for the highest (4%) concentration of sucralose were 
slightly lower than for the lower concentrations (i.e., 78%; Fig. 1). Preference scores for 
chow containing 2 – 16% mineral oil were also ~100%; the preference scores for chow 
containing 1% mineral oil were slightly lower (i.e., 81%; Fig. 1). Based on these findings, in 
the following experiments, we used 0.25% sucralose and 2% mineral oil—the lowest 
concentrations producing 100% preference scores.
There was no effect of either palatable agent on total food intakes (Fig. 1). A germane casual 
observation was that mice often defecated in the cup containing the plain diet. Mineral oil is 
a laxative but we did not observe any soft fecal boli from the mice eating it, even at high 
concentrations.
Experiment 1: Effect of sucralose and/or mineral oil added to chow on body weight and 
composition
Methods—This experiment investigated the effect on body weight and composition of 
various combinations of sucralose and/or mineral oil added to chow. Eighty mice were given 
a week to acclimate to our vivarium, and then were weighed weekly. After a baseline week, 
the mice weighed 24.1 ± 0.2 g (range 20.8 – 27.4 g). They were assigned to five groups of

 16, matched for body weight and body composition. The groups were fed a single cup of (1) 
plain chow, (2) chow + 0.25% sucralose, (3) chow + 2% mineral oil, (4) chow + 0.25% 
sucralose + 2% mineral oil, and (5) switching: chow + 0.25% sucralose on odd days and 
chow + 2% mineral oil on even days. The mice remained on the diets for 6 weeks. During 
the 7th week, the first four groups listed above received 96-h two-cup choice tests. We did 
not assess preferences of the group that switched daily between sucralose and mineral oil.
Weekly changes in body weights were analyzed using a two-way mixed-design analysis of 
variance (ANOVA), with factors of group and time (week 0 – 6). Body fat content in week 6 
was analyzed using a one-way ANOVA.
Results—Over the six-week experiment, all five groups of mice gained body weight 
progressively [Fig. 2; main effect of time, F(5,375) = 37.3, p < 0.0001]. There were no 
differences among the groups in body weight either throughout the experiment [main effect 
of group, F(4,75) = 0.80, p = 0.5284] or at any time [group × time interaction, F(20,375) = 
1.06, p = 0.3864]. Consistent with this, there were no group differences in body fat content 
or the percentage of body weight that was fat [F(4,75) = 0.43, p = 0.7807; means ± SE, 
percent fat; plain chow = 3.7 ± 0.4, chow + sucralose = 3.1 ± 0.4, chow + mineral oil = 4.0 
± 0.5, chow + sucralose + mineral oil = 3.4 ± 0.2, switching group = 3.4 ± 0.4].
Two-cup choice tests at the end of the experiment confirmed that the foods with sucralose 
and mineral oil were strongly preferred, despite 6 weeks of exposure to them. The group fed 
chow received two cups of chow and ate from them equally (preference score 47 ± 6%). 
Preference scores of the other groups were: chow + sucralose = 77 ± 5%, chow + mineral oil 
= 88 ± 3%, chow + sucralose + mineral oil = 97 ± 1%).
Experiment 2: Effect of sucralose added to chow or high-fat diet on body weight and 
composition
Methods—This experiment investigated the effect on body weight and composition of 
sucralose added to chow or high-fat diet. It involved 72 mice weighing 25.6 ± 0.2 g (range, 
20.8 – 29.1 g). The mice were assigned to one of four groups, matched for body weight and 
composition. According to a 2 × 2 design, two groups of 18 mice were fed chow, the other 
two were fed high-fat diet; one version of each diet contained 0.25% sucralose. Body 
weights were monitored for 9 weeks. During the 10th week, 48-h two-cup choice tests were 
conducted.
Weekly changes in body weights were analyzed using a three-way mixed-design ANOVA, 
with factors of diet type (chow or high-fat), diet sweetness (plain or sweetened) and time 
(week 0 – 9). Carcass fat at week 9 was analyzed using a two-way ANOVA.
Results—As expected, there was a strong effect of dietary fat to increase body weight [diet 
× time interaction, F(8,544) = 7.59. p < 0.0001]. Sucralose had no significant effect on body 
weight gain [Fig. 3; main effect of sucralose, F(1,68) = 2.78, p = 0.0998; sucralose × time 
interaction, F(8,544) = 1.62, p = 0.1158; sucralose × diet × time interaction, F(8,544) = 1.15, 
p = 0.3267].

 At the end of the experiment (week 9), the two groups fed chow had identical mean body 
weights (28.7 ± 0.4 g vs. 28.7 ± 0.4 g); the mice fed plain high-fat diet weighed slightly but 
not significantly more than did those fed the high-fat diet + sucralose (37.2 ± 1.1 g vs. 34.8 
± 1.1 g). Body fat content of the mice fed plain chow did not differ from those fed chow + 
sucralose (5.8 ± 0.6% versus 4.7 ± 0.4%). However, mice fed the plain high-fat diet had a 
significantly higher percentage body fat than did those fed the high-fat diet + sucralose diet 
(23.9 ± 1.6% versus 17.2 ± 1.6%), leading to a significant interaction between diet type and 
sweetness, F(1,68) = 5.59, p<0.0208.
Two-cup choice tests conducted at the end of the experiment confirmed that the mice had 
strong preferences for the diets with added sucralose. Preference scores of all 72 mice 
combined for the sweetened versions of their diets were 91 ± 2%, and for each group 
separately they were: plain chow group = 81 ± 3%, chow + sucralose group = 91 ± 5%, plain 
high-fat group = 94 ± 2%, high-fat + sucralose group = 97 ± 1%.
DISCUSSION
C57BL/6J mice had very strong and persistent preferences for food containing sucralose and 
mineral oil. Yet mice fed chow containing these ingredients for 6 weeks did not gain any 
more body weight or fat than did controls fed plain diet (Experiment 1). Similarly, mice fed 
high-fat diet for 9 weeks became obese, but the obesity was not exacerbated by adding 
sucralose—if anything, sucralose tended to reduce body weight gain and it significantly 
reduced fat stores (Experiment 2). These results add strength to the argument that “good 
taste” does not cause or contribute to obesity.
The most thorough previous attempt to investigate whether eating good-tasting food 
influences body weight was conducted by Naim et al. [(26); see introduction]. Our work 
differs from, and thus extends, this earlier work in several ways. First, Naim et al. (26) used 
rats whereas we used mice. Second, Naim et al. (26) gave their subjects food flavors with 
strong odor components whereas we used sucralose and mineral oil. The attraction of 
sucralose is its sweet taste; preferences for sucralose solutions are absent in mice with 
genetic ablation of molecular components of the sweet taste transduction cascade [e.g., 
(11,40)]. It is less clear why mice are attracted to mineral oil; its primary orosensory 
property, at least to humans, is oiliness (a texture); it may also have a greasy (16) or fatty 
taste [reviews (6,17,21) but see (33,42)], and it has an odor to rats (14). Our work with 
sucralose and mineral oil suggests that Naim et al.'s (26) findings cannot be discounted 
because the flavors they used did not stimulate taste or texture.
Third, Naim et al. (25,26) used food flavors that were preferred to plain food by naive rats, 
but these preferences may have waned with chronic exposure. One could argue that the 
extended association of a flavor with the metabolic effects of chow might lead to the flavor 
losing hedonic value, and so blunting its effects on body weight. But here, we found that 
strong preferences persisted even after the mice had consumed the diets with added 
sucralose and/or mineral oil as their only food for 6 or 9 weeks. One reason may be that we 
used palatability agents that are probably innately preferred. Preferences for sweetness are 
very likely innate [(36); review (4)]; whether the oral response to mineral oil is also innate is

 less clear, although two hallmarks of an innate response have been demonstrated: mineral oil 
stimulates ingestive responses early in life (1), and it supports sham ingestion (23).
Fourth, Naim et al. (26) manipulated both flavor and variety; rats were presented with 
several flavored foods both concurrently and successively. In contrast, here the focus was on 
manipulating taste without variety, although Experiment 1 included a group that received 
chow containing sucralose alternating daily with chow containing mineral oil. The reason to 
give animals variety is they might habituate or adapt to a single flavor (i.e., develop sensory-
specific satiety). However, this clearly was not the case for sucralose or mineral oil, because 
foods containing these additives were strongly preferred even by mice that had consumed 
them for 6 or 9 weeks.
Our goal was to use nonnutritive additives that would be among the most strongly preferred 
by mice. To accomplish this, we chose sucralose because C57BL/6J mice have strong 
preferences for sucralose solutions [(3,11); unlike rats (5,35)]. Sucralose has advantages 
over other artificial sweeteners in that it is easily available, and it has a less pronounced 
aftertaste than does saccharin (12). It has been argued that artificial sweeteners mixed with 
food (as opposed to water) are not particularly palatable stimuli to rats (24). However, our 
mice had preferences scores for sucralose-containing chow or high-fat diet that were 
consistently very strong, sometimes 100%; such high preferences are very rare, in our 
experience.
To our knowledge, the laboratory mouse's preferences for mineral oil in chow have not been 
assessed previously, although house mice appear to like it added to oatmeal (32). Early 
work, sometimes cited as evidence that the oiliness or greasiness imparted by mineral oil 
leads to chronic hyperphagia in rats, actually used a mixture of mineral oil and corn oil (8–
10), which confounds interpretation by changing the type and proportion of dietary fat.
Sucralose stimulates T1R2+T1R3 receptors, including those in the gut and pancreas [e.g., 
(18,20); review (13)], and it may alter gut bacteria that can influence metabolism [reviews 
(27,34)]. Our results suggest that these postingestive actions do not influence body weight, 
although they may be responsible for our finding that mice fed the high-fat diet with 
sucralose had less body fat than did those fed plain high-fat diet. This conclusion is limited 
because it is based on only the single dose of sucralose our mice ingested (~300 mg/kg/day), 
which on a per-kilogram basis is far above corresponding human intakes (~380 12-oz cans 
of diet cola/day). But more generally, there appears to be a disconnection between the 
substantial in vitro and minimal in vivo actions of sucralose [review (13)]. One important 
difference is that in vitro, sucralose is generally given alone whereas here, it was always 
ingested with food. Food has metabolic effects that likely dwarf those of sucralose, perhaps 
rendering it ineffectual.
Our findings do not support the adage that “if it tastes good, it must be bad for you.” We 
suspect the confusion derives from two sources. First, when good-tasting foods are initially 
made available, they are eaten in large quantities. However, it is wrong to infer that these 
acute increases in energy intake accumulate with repetition to influence body weight. 
Second, most palatable foods are also nutrient-dense, and so any effects attributed to “good

 taste” may actually be due to the high macronutrient density, a known cause of obesity (30). 
Appreciating that good taste is not inevitably linked to obesity raises a glimmer of hope for 
the food industry: Good taste can be used to attract consumers to nutrient-sparse foods 
without concern that this will adversely influence body weight.

 Highlights
•
Mice had extremely strong preferences for chow with 
added sucralose and/or mineral oil
•
Mice fed chow with added sucralose and/or mineral oil 
did not become obese
•
Mice fed plain or sucralose-sweetened high-fat diet 
gained body weight equally
•
Good-tasting foods do not necessarily cause obesity

 Figure 1. 
Results of 48-h two-cup choice tests between plain chow and chow with ascending 
concentrations of sucralose (left; n = 12) or mineral oil (right; n = 12). Circles show total 
daily food intake (i.e., intake of plain food + intake of food with palatability agent); square 
symbols show preference scores (i.e., intake of food with palatability agent/total food intake 
× 100). Horizontal dashed lines show 50% preference score (indifference). Vertical bars on 
symbols are SEMs; where not shown, the SEM was smaller than the symbol).

 Figure 2. 
Mean (± SE) body weights of groups of 16 male C57BL/6J mice fed for 6 weeks plain chow 
or chow with 0.25% sucralose and/or 2% mineral oil in various combinations. There were no 
significant differences among the five groups.

 Figure 3. 
Mean (± SE) body weights of groups of 18 male C57BL/6J mice fed for 9 weeks plain chow 
or chow with 0.25% sucralose, or plain high-fat diet, or high-fat diet with 0.25% sucralose. 
Both groups fed high-fat diet weighed significantly more than did those fed chow; the mice 
fed sucralose in high-fat diet weighed significantly less than those fed the plain high-fat diet.
