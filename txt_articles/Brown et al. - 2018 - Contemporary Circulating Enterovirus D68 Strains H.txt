ABSTRACT
Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) has historically been associated with respira-
tory illnesses. However, in the summers of 2014 and 2016, EV-D68 outbreaks coin-
cided with a spike in polio-like acute flaccid myelitis/paralysis (AFM/AFP) cases. This
raised concerns that EV-D68 could be the causative agent of AFM during these re-
cent outbreaks. To assess the potential neurotropism of EV-D68, we utilized the
neuroblastoma-derived neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y as a cell culture model to deter-
mine if differential infection is observed for different EV-D68 strains. In contrast to
HeLa and A549 cells, which support viral infection of all EV-D68 strains tested,
SH-SY5Y cells only supported infection by a subset of contemporary EV-D68 strains,
including isolates from the 2014 outbreak. Viral replication and infectivity in SH-SY5Y
were assessed using multiple assays: virus production, cytopathic effects, cellular ATP
release, and VP1 capsid protein production. Similar differential neurotropism was
also observed in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, primary human neuron cultures, and a
mouse paralysis model. Using the SH-SY5Y cell culture model, we determined that
barriers to viral binding and entry were at least partly responsible for the differential
infectivity phenotype. Transfection of genomic RNA into SH-SY5Y generated virions
for all EV-D68 isolates, but only a single round of replication was observed from
strains that could not directly infect SH-SY5Y. In addition to supporting virus replica-
tion and other functional studies, this cell culture model may help identify the sig-
natures of virulence to confirm epidemiological associations between EV-D68 strains
and AFM and allow for the rapid identification and characterization of emerging
neurotropic strains.
IMPORTANCE Since the EV-D68 outbreak during the summer of 2014, evidence of a
causal link to a type of limb paralysis (AFM) has been mounting. In this article, we
describe a neuronal cell culture model (SH-SY5Y cells) in which a subset of contem-
porary 2014 outbreak strains of EV-D68 show infectivity in neuronal cells, or neurot-
ropism. We confirmed the difference in neurotropism in vitro using primary human
neuron cell cultures and in vivo with a mouse paralysis model. Using the SH-SY5Y
cell model, we determined that a barrier to viral entry is at least partly responsible
for neurotropism. SH-SY5Y cells may be useful in determining if specific EV-D68 ge-
netic determinants are associated with neuropathogenesis, and replication in this

T
he Enterovirus genus in the Picornaviridae family comprises many important human
pathogens, including the following: human rhinoviruses (HRVs), the most common
viral agents of the common cold; polioviruses, the causative agent of poliomyelitis;
enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), associated with a variety of neurological diseases; and
enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). Enteroviruses appear to continually circulate in human
populations, with most infections being asymptomatic. For example, up to 72% of
poliovirus infections are asymptomatic (1). When poliovirus infections are symptomatic,
they can cause a wide spectrum of clinically distinct syndromes, ranging from minor,
nonspecific illness, to nonparalytic aseptic meningitis and flaccid paralysis (2). Before
the widespread use of effective vaccines, poliovirus-induced paralysis reached a peak of
21,000 cases in the United States in 1952 (3).
EV-D68 was first detected in children with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in 1962 (4).
Until recently, EV-D68 was one of the most rarely reported enteroviruses, with only 26
cases documented by the National Enterovirus Surveillance System in the United States
from 1970 to 2005 (5). Beginning in 2009, multiple contemporary clades began emerg-
ing worldwide (6). In the summer and fall of 2014, 49 U.S. states experienced a
nationwide outbreak of severe respiratory illness associated with EV-D68, with 1,153
confirmed cases, including 14 deaths (7). Shortly after the U.S. outbreak, EV-D68
infections were also reported in Canada, Europe, and Asia. The total number of reported
EV-D68 cases in 2014 exceeded 2,000 from 20 countries, resulting in the public health
community classifying EV-D68 as a reemerging pathogen of public health concern (8).
Reports of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) occurring coincident to the outbreak of
EV-D68 respiratory disease raised the possibility that EV-D68 might be a causative agent
of AFM (7). EV-D68 infection within a subset of these AFM cases was confirmed in
several independent epidemiological clusters in the United States (9–14), France (15),
Norway (16), Canada (17), and Australia (18). Statistical analyses of the AFM cases in
Colorado (12) and California (19) have supported the association between EV-D68 and
AFM, and viral nucleic acid detection studies of patient samples have failed to reveal an
alternative etiology (7, 10). During the 2014 EV-D68 outbreak, patients presenting with
AFM showed distinctive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings characterized by
brain stem and gray matter longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions. This matches
the findings described in previous outbreaks of EV-A71-associated AFM (9, 19, 20),
suggesting that an enterovirus may be responsible. In support of this hypothesis, Hixon
et al. (21) established that several contemporary EV-D68 strains, but not the historically
archetypal Fermon and Rhyne EV-D68 strains, can cause a paralytic disease in neonatal
mice due to viral infection and killing of spinal cord motor neurons.
Phylogenetic analysis reported that many of the 2014 EV-D68 outbreak isolates
associated with AFM appeared to belong to the phylogenetic subclade B1 (10, 22).
Interestingly, 12 substitutions identified in B1 2014 isolates carry the same amino acid
or nucleotide residues observed at equivalent positions in other paralysis-causing
enteroviruses, including poliovirus and EV-A71 (22). This suggests that one or more of
the nucleotide substitutions present in contemporary EV-D68 strains and lineages and
not found in historical archetypal strains may be responsible for the apparent increased
incidence of neuropathology associated with the 2014 outbreak. EV-D68 has continued
to evolve since the 2014 outbreak, which is unsurprising as mutation and recombina-
tion are known to occur in enteroviruses (23–25). Sequence analysis has led to the
classification of a new clade, D (a subclade of A) (26, 27), and a new subclade, B3, has
emerged and quickly expanded (26, 28, 29). Neurological symptoms have been asso-
ciated with the novel B3 clade in Sweden (30), The Netherlands (31), Taiwan (32), Italy
(33), and the United States (34), which experienced another AFM outbreak during the

 2016 enterovirus season (summer and fall), with a total of 149 confirmed cases (2). The
seasonality and magnitude of this AFM outbreak match the AFM surge observed in
2014. Additional surveillance of potentially emerging neurotropic or neuropathogenic
strains is warranted.
To test if a specific genotype is associated with neurological symptoms, we report
the development of a cell culture infection model based on the neuroblastoma cell line
SH-SY5Y, which shows differential infectivity by different EV-D68 isolates. We observe
a correlation between infection and replication in SH-SY5Y cells and neuropathogenesis
in mice. This neuronal SH-SY5Y model may be useful for analysis of virus-host interac-
tions in vitro and provides a facile assay to quantify which EV-D68 strains are neu-
rotropic and neuropathogenic, potentially leading to better surveillance of virulent
EV-D68 strains.
RESULTS
SH-SY5Y cells express higher levels of neuron-specific genes than other can-
didate cell lines. Seeking a human cell culture to model neuron-specific infectivity, we
performed transcriptome profiling of two commonly used “neuronal-like” cell lines,
SH-SY5Y and HTB10. These cell lines were compared with HeLa cells as a nonneuronal
permissive cell culture model. Both of these neuronal cell lines were first cultured by
Biedler et al. in the early 1970s. SH-SY5Y is a subclone of the HTB11 (SK-N-SH)
neuroblastoma cell line that was selected as an apparently homogenous population of
cells with neuronal cell morphology. HTB10 (also known as SK-N-MC), reported as a
neuroepithelioma cell line, has been used as a model for different neurotrophic viruses,
such as hepatitis C poliovirus (35, 36) and enterovirus A71 (37). We used RNA sequenc-
ing (RNA-seq) to determine the genes expressed in SH-SY5Y, HeLa, and HTB10 cells and
specifically assessed the expression of 30 neuronal cell marker genes that were selected
as being highly neuron specific (Table 1). Of the 30 selected genes, 24 showed
measurable expression in SH-SY5Y cells, 23 of which showed higher expression levels
in SH-SY5Y compared to HTB10 cells, and little if any expression in HeLa cells. These
findings support the use of SH-SY5Y as a model neuronal cell line, while raising
questions about the suitability of HTB10 as a “neuronal-like” cell line.
A representative B1 clade EV-D68 strain, US/MO/47, replicates in SH-SY5Y cells.
Given the epidemiological association of recent EV-D68 infections with AFM, we sought
to determine if there are any differential growth phenotypes between contemporary
and historical EV-D68 strains in neuronal versus nonneuronal cell lines. To measure viral
replication kinetics, each cell line was infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1,
and the virus growth was measured by determining virus titers (50% tissue culture
infective dose [TCID50]) in culture supernatant at five time points postinfection. To
examine whether viruses from the B1 clade showed any phenotypic differences in their
ability to infect human neuronal cells, we first selected three different viruses to
represent the phylogenetic diversity of EV-D68. US/MO/14-18947 from Missouri (US/
MO/47) was selected as a representative of the B1 clade since it carries all 21 substi-
tutions identified in our previous comparative genomics analysis (22). USA/N0051U5/
2012 from Tennessee (US/TN) was selected as a representative of clade A since it was
isolated in the United States (38) during roughly the same time frame as US/MO/47 and
possesses none of the 21 substitutions. VR1197 was selected as an example of an
historical isolate similar to the prototypical Fermon strain isolated in 1962.
All three EV-D68 strains replicate in the nonneuronal cell line HeLa (Fig. 1A) and the
alveolar A549 cell line (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). These viruses also
cause cell death as judged by visual evidence of cytopathic effect (CPE) in infected cell
culture (Fig. 1B). In contrast, only US/MO/47 could replicate in the SH-SY5Y neuronal cell
line, reaching peak titers of �105 TCID50/ml by 48 h postinfection (hpi). US/TN and
VR1197 did not show any signs of replication, with titers not exceeding background
after 96 hpi (Fig. 1A). Similarly, CPE was observed after infection of SH-SY5Y cells with
US/MO/47, but not with US/TN or VR1197 (Fig. 1B). Similar results were seen at MOI of
0.01 and 1.0 (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Furthermore, multiple passages

 of US/TN- or VR1197-infected supernatant onto fresh SH-SY5Y cells (passaging every
4 days for 12 days) failed to produce CPE (data not shown). No increase in viral titers
above background levels was detected by any virus following infection of HTB10.
Immunofluorescence confirms US/MO/47 replication in SH-SY5Y cells. We also
examined production of the virus VP1 protein during infection of HeLa and SH-SY5Y
cells. VP1 is among the initial proteins expressed following picornavirus infection,
preceding capsid assembly (39). We examined the ability of US/MO/47, US/TN, and
VR1197 viruses to synthesize the VP1 capsid protein 18 hpi using immunofluorescence.
VP1 protein was detected in cells following infection of HeLa cells with all three EV-D68
strains (Fig. 1C). However, only the US/MO/47 isolate produced VP1 following infection
of the SH-SY5Y neuronal cell line (Fig. 1C), which is consistent with our data on viral
replication and CPE (Fig. 1A and B). Also consistent with the viral replication experi-
ments, no VP1 was produced by any of the three strains when HTB10 cells were
infected (data not shown). As typically observed in picornaviruses, VP1 staining was
observed in the cytoplasm and not the nucleus of both HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells.
Intramuscular virus injection of neurotropic EV-D68 causes paralysis in neo-
natal mice. US/MO/47, US/TN, and VR1197 were assessed in vivo for their ability to
cause paralysis and neuropathogenesis in 2-day-old outbred Swiss Webster mouse
pups as previously described by Hixon et al. (21). Intramuscular injection of US/MO/47
resulted in limb paresis and paralysis in all mice injected (n � 10) as quantified by a
motor impairment score (Fig. 2A). Most mice injected with US/MO/47 developed
moderate to severe paralysis in both rear limbs. Paralysis always began in the injected
hind limb and then spread to the contralateral hind limb in most animals, with rare

 spread of paralysis to the fore limbs. Quantification of the average motor impairment
over time showed onset of weakness starting at approximately 4 days postinfection
(dpi), with progressive worsening through 7 dpi, with the majority of mice continuing
to have moderate to severe weakness in both hind limbs through the end of the
observation period at 14 dpi. These data are consistent with previously published
results on EV-D68-induced paralysis (21, 40). In particular, Hixon et al. (21) found that
mice with paralysis by intramuscular injection of US/MO/47 analyzed histologically had
corresponding cell death and viral antigen present in the anterior horns of the expected
spinal cord regions. In contrast to US/MO/47, mice receiving intramuscular injection of
US/TN (n � 11) or VR1197 (n � 10) failed to develop any signs of motor impairment
during the 2-week observation period.
Neurotropic EV-D68 can be detected in the spinal cords of paralyzed mice.

was first detected at 2 dpi in spinal cords (�103 TCID50/spinal cord), which corre-
sponded with a rapid increase in viral titer within the muscle tissue (�105 TCID50/mg)
of the injected limb (Fig. 2B). Viral titer remained detectable in both spinal cords (�103
TCID50/spinal cord) and muscle tissue (�104 TCID50/mg) at 6 dpi in US/MO/47-injected
mice. In contrast, neither US/TN nor VR1197 produced detectable infection within
mouse spinal cords. We observed sustained viral titers from US/TN within mouse
muscle up to 6 dpi (�103 TCID50/mg), but no detectable spread of virus to spinal cord.
VR1197 did not produce a sustained infection in mouse muscle, and the viral titer
dropped to the limits of detection by 6 dpi.

from the B1, B2, and D1 clades. Interestingly, all additional viral strains replicated in
both HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 3A), including another strain from the B1 clade

 showed CPE after infection of SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 3D). All EV-D68 strains replicated at
similar rates in HeLa cells.
To validate our qualitative CPE evaluation, we performed an independent assay of
cell death using ATP content as determined by CellTiter Glo luminescence assay
(Promega) as a surrogate for viable, intact cells. Using an MOI of 0.1, cell viability
dropped after 12 hpi when HeLa cells were infected with every EV-D68 strain tested and
continued to drop until the limit of detection was reached, between 48 and 72 hpi
(Fig. 3B). In contrast, cell viability of infected SH-SY5Y cells, beginning at approximately
48 hpi, only dropped for strains where CPE was present. The results of the cell viability
and CPE assays were reflective of the TCID50 data in HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells for the new
panel. The cell viability assay was also performed at 37°
C, which produced a similar
replication pattern despite initial reports that EV-D68 grows poorly at 37°
C (41). We
observed similar rates of viral replication in HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells at both 33 and 37°
C
(see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material).
Human rhinovirus does not infect SH-SY5Y. SH-SY5Y cells were tested for infec-

viability assay (Fig. 3C) or visual inspection for CPE (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental
material).
Differential infection by EV-D68 viral strains is the same in differentiated and
undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells and in primary human neurons. To further charac-
terize the differential replication capability of different EV-D68 strains, we differentiated
SH-SY5Y using a well-established retinoic acid (RA) treatment protocol (42, 43), before
virus infection, and confirmed differentiation by microscopic examination for morpho-
logical changes. We observed no difference in EV-D68 infectivity patterns between
differentiated and undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells. CPE observation (data not shown)
and the viral replication rate (see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material) were similar
compared to undifferentiated SH-SY5Y for all strains. All strains that could replicate in
undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells could also replicate in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, and
viral strains that could not replicate also did not replicate in differentiated SH-SY5Y
cells. This demonstrates that EV-D68 strains are capable of infecting neuronal precur-
sors and can also infect mature differentiated neuronal cells. Primary human fetal
brain-derived neurons were cultured and infected with US/TN, VR1197, and US/MO/47
(see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material). Neurotropic and nonneurotropic EV-D68
strains showed the same infectivity pattern in SH-SY5Y. Using an MOI of 0.01, US/TN
and VR1197 plated onto primary neuronal cells did not replicate and viral titers did not
rise above the inoculation-level baseline. In contrast, an increase in viral titers was
observed when the neurotropic strain US/MO/47-infected primary neuronal cells and
reached peak titer �105 TCID50/ml at 24 hpi.
All EV-D68 strains generate virus when transfected into SH-SY5Y cells. To
determine if virus cell entry may be responsible for restricting virus replication in
SH-SY5Y for some isolates, full-length genomic RNA from each of the EV-D68 isolates
was transfected into the cytoplasm of SH-SY5Y cells and virus production was mea-
sured. RNA transfection into HeLa cells resulted in a viral infection and replication
pattern similar to intact virus infections at an MOI of 0.1, with viral titers peaking at
�107 TCID50/ml for all EV-D68 strains tested. In contrast to what we observed using
standard infection assays, all tested D68 strains generated virus following RNA trans-
fection into SH-SY5Y cells. However, the viral titer peaked at 104 TCID50/ml 48 h after
transfection of SH-SY5Y for viral strains that could not infect SH-SY5Y cells using intact
virions (Fig. 4A and B), whereas the viral titer continued to increase until saturation at
approximately 107 TCID50/ml following transfection of SH-SY5Y with strains that could
infect SH-SY5Y cells.
EV-D68 binding efficiency to SH-SY5Y is significantly increased for neurotropic
strains. To determine if viral attachment is the bottleneck to viral entry for the
nonneurotropic phenotype observed, we performed a virus-cell binding assay (44).
EV-D68 strains at an MOI of 1 were incubated with either HeLa cells or SH-SY5Y cells at
4°
C for 2 h. Upon washing cells to remove any unbound virus, cell-associated viral copy
numbers were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Threshold cycle (CT)
values were obtained, and viral copy numbers were calculated based on a standard
curve (Fig. 4C). HeLa cells incubated with EV-D68 strains VR1197, US/TN, and US/MO/47
showed substantial virus retention and did not show a significant difference in binding
activity. In contrast, �100-fold more copies of US/MO/47 were bound to SH-SY5Y
compared to US/TN and VR1197.
DISCUSSION
Here we report on the differential infectivity between various contemporary and
historical EV-D68 strains in SH-SY5Y as measured by viral replication, cell viability, CPE,
and immunofluorescence. The clade specificity of neuropathogenesis previously re-
ported (10, 22, 26–28, 33, 34) between contemporary and historical strains is observed
in the neurotropism in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 5). Among the EV-D68 strains used in this
study, those from clades B1, B2, and D1 were able to infect SH-SY5Y cells, whereas those
from clade A and other historical strains could not (45). We also showed that this

 differential growth is at least partly due to differential viral entry, as all strains can
replicate and produce viral progeny after transfection.
To determine the most appropriate tissue culture model system, we explored the
gene expression by RNA sequencing and showed that transcripts from SH-SY5Y cells
are enriched for neuronal-specific genes relative to HeLa and HTB10 cells. This agrees
with several other groups which have shown the expression of specific neurological
marker genes in SH-SY5Y cells (42, 46, 47). Of note for this study, SH-SY5Y also showed
relatively high expression of the ISL1 gene, which is expressed in all postmitotic motor
neurons and is required for various aspects of motor neuron development (48). This
neuronal cell line has successfully been used as a model to study the in vitro neuro-
pathogenic effects of different viruses, notably, as a model for paralytic enteroviral

standard curve. Error bars represent SEM from three biological replicates.

 isolates, including EV-A71 and poliovirus (36, 49–55). Numerous other viruses associ-
ated with neurological symptoms can infect SH-SY5Y, including: Japanese encephalitis
virus (56), human immunodeficiency virus (57), human cytomegalovirus (58), varicella-
zoster virus (59), chikungunya virus (60), mumps virus (61), dengue virus (62), Zika virus
(63, 64), and rabies virus (65), suggesting that SH-SY5Y is an excellent model system for
neurotropic viruses.
We found support of the biological relevance of SH-SY5Y cells as a cell culture model
by observing the same infectivity pattern in vitro with other neuronal cell cultures.
SH-SY5Y cells are capable of being differentiated using retinoic acid, which leads to
more neuron-specific morphology and gene expression. These differentiated cells are
characterized by the formation of extensive neurites, as well as the induction of
neuron-specific enzymes, receptors, and neurotransmitters (42). Differentiated SH-SY5Y
cells have been used as models for neuron-virus interactions (66) including EV-A71 (54,
55), chikungunya virus (60), and varicella-zoster virus (59). Our results show that both

 differentiated and undifferentiated SH-SY5Y can be infected with neurotropic strains of
EV-D68, suggesting neurotropic strains of EV-D68 can invade both immature and
mature neuronal cells. Primary human fetal brain-derived neurons have also been used
to study infectivity patterns of neurotropic viruses as well as the central nervous system
(67, 68). We also observed a similar EV-D68 replication pattern in human primary
postnatal neurons. Interestingly, despite initially reported as growing poorly at 37°
C
(41), we observed similar rates of EV-D68 replication in SH-SY5Y cells at both 33 and
37°
C, which would likely be a more biologically relevant temperature for paralytic
infections at the core body temperature rather than the lower temperature of the upper
respiratory system that supports more routine respiratory infection.
EV-D68 is closely related to human rhinovirus (HRV) within the Picornaviridae family
(69). Frequent coinfection in patients and cross-reactivity of quantitative PCR-based
screening had led to misdiagnosis of EV-D68 infection as HRV infection prior to the
2014 outbreak (70, 71). Despite the similarity in respiratory symptoms, HRV lacks any
association with the neurological symptoms of other enteroviruses, such as EV-D68 and
EV-A71 (69). Indeed, despite their similarity to EV-D68, none of the 6 HRV strains could
infect SH-SY5Y cells.
We hypothesized that the reason for differential replication in SH-SY5Y cells of
EV-D68 strain relates to different viral entry capabilities. We used RNA transfection to
deliver infectious RNA to the cytoplasm, bypassing natural viral entry mechanisms
during an infection. All EV-D68 strains generated virus following RNA transfection, but
in some cases, viral titers plateaued at a relatively lower level, suggesting that only a
single round of replication had occurred. HRV RNA transfected into SH-SY5Y cells
produced a similar result. Our interpretation is that differences in the sequence and
structure of viral capsid proteins are responsible for the differential infectivity in
SH-SY5Y cells by EV-D68 strains and that viral entry is what prevents HRV, US/TN, and
the historical strains from infecting SH-SY5Y cells. It has recently been reported that a
chimeric swap mutant exchanging the viral capsid from EV-D68 VR1197 and a neu-
rotropic EV-D94 strain capable of replication in SH-SY5Y cells results in a loss of
infectivity in SH-SY5Y cells (45). This result further supports our conclusion that viral
entry mediated by the capsid is the cause of the observed differential neurotropism. We
performed a virus-cell binding assay (44, 72) that further supports this conclusion.
Approximately 100 times more copies of viral RNA were detected, indicating more virus
particles bound to cells when US/MO/47 was incubated with SH-SY5Y cells compared
to US/TN and VR1197. This indicates that the binding affinity of US/MO/47 to SH-SY5Y
neuronal cells is greater than that of nonneurotropic strains, suggesting that virus
binding could be limiting for D68 replication in neuronal cells. However, viral entry was
not blocked and therefore may be measured in addition to viral binding. Specific
genetic residues may be the cause of this differential neurotropism. A comparative
analysis using infectious clones bearing specific polymorphisms will likely be needed to
establish the determinants of neurotropism in SH-SY5Y cells. In particular, the 2014
outbreak B1 substitutions in VP1/98A, VP1/148V, VP1/280K, VP1/290S, VP1/308N, and
VP2/222T are all located on the virion surface and could be directly involved in
virus-host cell attachment and would be good candidates to evaluate.
Our results closely correlate with the differential paralytic myelitis caused by EV-D68
in mice suggesting that infectivity in SH-SY5Y cells may be an effective proxy for
neuropathogenesis (Fig. 5). Multiple contemporary EV-D68 strains that have been
shown to cause paralytic myelitis in mice were also neurotropic in SH-SY5Y cells (21).
However, not all of the contemporary strains that exhibit in vitro neurotropism (e.g.,
US/CA/14-4231) have been shown to cause myelitis in mice, suggesting there could be
further host- or species-specific factors that also contribute to the development of
myelitis when infected with a neurotropic EV-D68 strain (21). The historical, nonneu-
rotropic strains that are nonparalytic in mice did not grow in SH-SY5Y cells. In particular,
the contemporary EV-D68 strain, US/TN, which was nonneurotropic in SH-SY5Y cells
and not previously reported by Hixon et al. (21), failed to produce paralysis in mice and
could not be found in mouse spinal cord tissue.

 US/TN appeared to replicate at a low level within mouse muscle tissue, indicating
lack of paralysis was not due to an inability to infect the mice. Interestingly, one
alternative hypothesis for how EV-D68 might cause paralysis is through myositis, not
myelitis (73). This is based on the observation that an intranasal-adapted EV-D68 stain
used to intranasally inoculate immunodeficient mice (AG129) causes paralysis with the
absence of myelitis. Our observed increased replication in muscle by US/MO/47 relative
to US/TN and VR1197 (Fig. 2) suggests that may be possible. However, the lack of
myelitis with the intranasal-adapted EV-D68 strain may be due to different genetic
residues, arising from the 30 passages of US/MO/49 used to generate the intranasal-
adapted EV-D68 strain, potentially disabling viral entry to neuronal cells. Of note, Swiss
Webster mice challenged intranasally with EV-D68 US/MO/47 appear to develop my-
elitis as detected by staining for viral antigen and RT-PCR for virus in spinal cord tissue
(21). Testing the neurotropism of the intranasal-adapted EV-D68 stain (73) via SH-SY5Y
cells would help elucidate if there are potentially multiple mechanisms by which
EV-D68 causes paralysis.
The infectivity pattern in SH-SY5Y cells, along with the agreement in primary
postnatal neurons, supports the mouse model reported by Hixon et al. (21) and
validates the results in the SH-SY5Y human cell line. This is significant because, while
useful, mouse models are costly and introduce potential caveats, such as transcriptional
factor differences in mice versus humans (74–76), and there is debate whether the
mouse model recapitulates human conditions (77, 78). Evidence presented here sup-
ports the validity of the mouse model.
In conclusion, we present a differential neuronal infectivity phenotype between
contemporary and historical EV-D68 strains. Permissible infection of SH-SY5Y cells
mimics the paralysis pattern reported in animal models. The high-throughput nature of
tissue culture models will allow for rapid screening of novel viral strains and recombi-
nant viruses to elucidate the genetic determinants of neurotropism and potential
antiviral therapies. This can enable identification of EV-D68 signatures of virulence
responsible for neural infection and potentially neurological disease and avoids the
cost associated with large-scale screening using animal models. Further, this supports
the theory of a causal link between AFM in humans and EV-D68.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture. HeLa cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco’
s modified Eagle’
s medium (DMEM;
Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone). HTB10 (ATCC) cells were maintained
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and nonessential amino acids (Gibco). SH-SY5Y (CLR-2266; ATCC)
cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and F-12 (Gibco) medium supplemented with 10% FBS.
To differentiate SH-SY5Y cells, an �50% confluent flask of SH-SY5Y cells had medium replaced with 1:1
mixture of DMEM and F-12 (Gibco) medium supplemented with 3% FBS and 10 �M retinoic acid (RA
[Sigma]) (53). After 3 days of exposure to RA, the morphology of cells was evaluated, and cells were
passaged for further use. Morphology and cytopathic effect were evaluated using an inverted micro-
scope. Human postnatal day 0 (P0) brain neurons were purchased from ScienCell (catalog no. 1520) and
plated at a density of 40,000 neurons/well on poly-D-lysine-coated 96-well plates (68). The neurons were
maintained in ScienCell neuronal growth medium with penicillin-streptomycin (catalog no. 1520) at 37°
C
in 5% CO2 until day in vitro (DIV) 7, by which time the neurons had well-established neurites.
Virus stock preparation. EV-D68 stocks were prepared by infecting HeLa or rhabdomyosarcoma
(RD) cells (ATCC) at 33°
C in 5% CO2 until CPE was observed. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation,
and titers were determined in a standard 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assay and calculated
by the Spearman-Kärber method. The source of each strain is detailed in Table S1 in the supplemental
material.
Replication kinetics of EV-D68. The replication kinetics for HeLa, A549, HTB10, SH-SY5Y, and
differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were evaluated in a high-throughput manner. Viral replication kinetics were
measured from sets of flat-bottom 96-well plates. Sets of plates corresponding to the number of desired
time points in an experiment were infected at the same initial time, using distinct 96-well plates for each
time point. Infected plates were incubated at 33 to 34°
C with 5% CO2 until the designated time point,
when each corresponding plate was placed in a �80°
C freezer until the entire time course was
completed. Mock-infected wells adjacent to each condition demonstrated that no contamination oc-
curred across wells. After 2 h, high-MOI plates (0.1 and 1) were washed three times with phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS), and the 2-h time point plate was frozen to determine the background levels of virus
present, since 2 h is long enough for EV-D68 entry but not long enough for replication. After three
freeze-thaw cycles, the viral titers from 10-fold serial dilutions of each sample were evaluated using a
50% TCID50 assay on HeLa cells. Plates were scored after adding 100 �l of crystal violet fixative per well

 followed by 1 h of incubation at room temperature and washing to remove unbound dye. Crystal violet
fixative was prepared by adding 5 g crystal violet (Sigma) and 8.5 g sodium chloride (Sigma) to 50 ml
formaldehyde, 260 ml ethanol, and 690 ml deionized water.
For replication kinetics in human postnatal neurons, day in vitro (DIV) 7 neurons were infected with
EV-D68 US/MO/47, US/TN, or VR1197 at an MOI of 0.01. Infection medium was left on the cells for the
duration of the experiment to minimize loss of cells from multiple rinses due to low cell adhesion. Cell
culture supernatant and lysate were collected at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, with three biological replicates
collected per time point for each viral strain. Lysate was serially diluted 10-fold from 1 (raw lysate) to 10�6
RD cells at 33°
C and evaluated using a 50% TCID50 assay.
Immunostaining. HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells were grown to 50% to 70% confluence on coverslips in a
24-well plate and infected with EV-D68 strains at an MOI of 1.0. Mock-infected cells serve as a negative
control. Coverslips were incubated at 34°
C in 5% CO2 for 18 h and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) and stored at 4°
C. The coverslips were washed with PBS, and cells were permeabilized with 0.1%
Triton-X for 10 min. The coverslips were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. The cells
were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-VP1 of EV-D68 (GeneTex) at a final concentration of 4 �g/ml
overnight at 4°
C, washed 3 times, and then incubated with a secondary goat anti-rabbit rhodamine red-X
(Thermo Fisher) at a final concentration of 1 �g/ml for 30 min. To visualize nuclei, DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-
2-phenylindole) stain was added to the second of three washes. The wells were visualized on an Axioskop
2 Plus (Zeiss) fluorescence microscope using DAPI and rhodamine filters. Images were taken with an
AxioCam MRc5 (Zeiss) camera using AxioVision software. All images for a particular filter were taken
under identical exposure conditions.
Mouse infections with EV-D68. Animal experiments were performed in an AAALAC-accredited
animal facility under IACUC protocol B-34716(03)1E at the University of Colorado. Pregnant female Swiss
Webster mice were ordered from Envigo and kept in standard housing until the pups were born. At
postnatal day 2, the dam and pups were transferred the biosafety level 2 (BSL2) region of the animal
facility. P2 Swiss Webster mouse pups were then inoculated with 106.8 TCID50/ml virus in 10 �g by
intramuscular injection into the left medial hind limb (21). Mouse pups of both sexes were randomized
to treatment conditions before virus inoculation.
Motor impairment scoring. Mice were monitored daily for 14 days. To assess paralysis, mice were
removed from the cage and observed moving on a flat surface for several minutes, during which each
limb was given a motor impairment score: 0, no motor impairment; 1, mild motor impairment, ataxia, or
decreased movement present and toe/knuckle walking; 2, moderate impairment, profound ataxia, and
limited movement of limb; and 3, severe impairment, no movement in limb, and limb is non-weight
bearing. The final motor impairment score for each day was achieved by summing the score for each
limb.
Mouse tissue collection. Mouse pups were sacrificed by decapitation for collection of muscle and
spinal cord tissue. Spinal cords were removed as previously described (21, 40). Muscle tissue was
collected from the inoculated limb (with the goal of obtaining as much muscle tissue possible from the
anterior and posterior thigh and gastrocnemius). Both tissues were collected into BeadBug tubes
containing inert ceramic bead and 0.3 ml of ice-cold, sterile PBS. Tissues were lysed mechanically on a
BeadBug tissue homogenizer for 45 s at 2,800 rpm and stored at �80°
C. After thawing, tissue samples
were spun at 2,700 � g for 1 min to remove tissue chunks from the lysate. Lysate was serially diluted
10-fold from 1 (raw lysate) to 10�6 and plated in a standard TCID50 assay to determine the final viral titer.
To get the final titer per whole spinal cord, the TCID50/ml was multiplied by 0.3 ml. To get the final muscle
titer per milligram of tissue, the TCID50/ml was multiplied by 0.3 ml and divided by the weight of tissue
collected. Samples that were below the limit of detection were graphed at zero.
Cell ATP/viability assay. Cells were cultured and evaluated in the same manner as in the viral
replication kinetics assays. ATP levels were measured using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability
assay kit (catalog no. G7570; Promega), and cell viability was calculated relative to that of the mock
control. To preserve the ATP levels so that each time point could be evaluated concurrently, cell
supernatant was removed and cells were frozen at �80°
C. Once the time series was completed, all plates
were removed and room temperature medium was added to each plate. Upon stabilization at room
temperature for 20 min, the manufacturer’
s protocol was followed. We validated this deviation from the
manufacturer’
s protocol by confirming the linearity of the assay across the active range of the study.
RNA sequencing. In order to explore the use of SH-SY5Y as an appropriate neuronal cell model, we
used RNA sequencing to obtain a comprehensive view of the genes expressed in the SH-SY5Y, HeLa, and
HTB10 cell lines. To prepare cells for RNA sequencing, 104 cells were grown in a 96-well plate for 24 h in
quadruplicate before being washed and resuspended in 10 �l of cell lysis buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 2
U/�l RNase inhibitor, 1:2,000,000 dilution of ERCC spike-in RNAs [Life Technologies]) per well. Full-length
cDNA was amplified using the SmartSeq2 protocol optimized in our laboratory (79, 80) before Nextera
XT library preparation and sequencing on a NextSeq500 with 2 � 150 paired-end reads. After adapter/
primer trimming using the Trimmomatic tool (http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page�trimmomatic),
trimmed sequencing reads were mapped to transcripts derived from the human reference genome
(GRCh37), and gene expression levels (transcripts per million reads [TPM]) were estimated using the
RSEM package (81).
RNA purification and transfection. RNA used for transfections was purified from viral stocks grown
in HeLa cells. Purification was performed using QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’
s instructions; final RNA concentrations were approximately 100 ng/�l. In 12-well plates,
selected cell cultures were seeded and grown. According to the manufacturer’
