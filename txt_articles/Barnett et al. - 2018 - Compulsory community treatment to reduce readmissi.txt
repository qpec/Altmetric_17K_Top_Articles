Introduction
Compulsory 
community 
treatment 
(CCT) 
makes 
adherence to treatment a legal requirement for people 
with mental illness who live in the community.1 The 
introduction of CCT in England and Wales, the USA, 
Australia, the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, and parts of 
Canada1,2 has triggered substantial debate about whether 
such measures reduce so-called revolving door use of 
inpatient services enough to justify the associated 
restriction of patient liberty.3 In England and Wales, CCT 
makes patients who are discharged from compulsory 
inpatient care subject to hospital recall if they do not 
comply with conditions that can include maintaining 
contact with services.3,4 CCT can also require adherence to 
conditions including taking medication, abstaining from 
illicit drugs, and attending outpatient appointments.5 
CCT can also impose requirements on service providers 
to make care available.1 CCT schemes differ among 
countries in terms of length, extent, and prerequisites of 
compulsion.6
Arguments for CCT concentrate on its less restrictive 
nature compared with admission to hospital,1,3,7 and its 
Compulsory community treatment to reduce readmission to

Summary
Background Compulsory community treatment (CCT) aims to reduce hospital readmissions among people with 
mental illness. However, research examining the usefulness of CCT is inconclusive. We aimed to assess the 
effectiveness of CCT in reducing readmission and length of stay in hospital and increasing community service use 
and treatment adherence.
Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched three databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE and 
Embase) for quantitative studies on CCT published in English between Jan 1, 1806, and Jan 4, 2018. We included both 
randomised and non-randomised designs that compared CCT with no CCT, and pre-post designs that compared 
patients before and after CCT. Studies were eligible if they had been peer-reviewed, if 50% or more of patients had 
severe mental illness, and if CCT was the intervention. Trials in which CCT was used in response to a criminal 
offence were excluded. We extracted data on study characteristics and length of follow-up, patient-level data on 
diagnosis, age, sex, race, and admission history, and outcomes of interest (readmission to hospital, inpatient bed-
days, community service use, and treatment adherence) for meta-analysis, for which we extracted summary estimates. 
We used a random-effects model to compare disparate outcome measures and convert effect size statistics into 
standardised mean differences. This systematic review is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018086232.
Findings Of 1931 studies identified, 41 (2%) met inclusion criteria and had sufficient data for analysis. Before and after 
CCT comparisons showed significant large effects on readmission to hospital (standardised mean difference 0·80, 
95% CI 0·53–1·08; I²=94·74), use of community services (0·83, 0·46–1·21; I²=87·26), and treatment adherence 
(2·12, 1·69–2·55; I²=0), and a medium effect on inpatient bed-days (0·66, 0·46–0·85; I²=94·12). Contemporaneous 
controlled comparison studies (randomised and non-randomised) showed no significant effect on readmission, 
inpatient bed-days, or treatment adherence, but a moderate effect on use of community services (0·38, 0·19–0·58; 
I²=96·92). A high degree of variability in study quality was found, with observational study ratings ranging from three 
to nine. Bias most frequently centred on poor comparability between CCT and control participants. 
Interpretation We found no consistent evidence that CCT reduces readmission or length of inpatient stay, although it 
might have some benefit in enforcing use of outpatient treatment or increasing service provision, or both. Future 
research should focus on why some people do not engage with treatment offered and on enhancing quality of the 
community care available. Shortcomings of this study include high levels of variability between studies and variation 
in study quality.

potential to prevent relapses and readmissions.8 However, 
evidence supporting these benefits is inconclusive and 
CCT could risk replacement of engagement and building 
therapeutic alliance with unjustified control and threat, 
while ignoring underlying reasons for non-adherence7,9—
eg, the need for better community services or increased 
engagement of service users in decision making.3,10 
Furthermore, restriction of liberty of adults who might 
have capacity for decision making and who have broken 
no laws has been questioned by both service users and 
health-care professionals.8,11 However, some studies have 
reported preference among patients for CCT if the 
alternative is admission to hospital,12 and carers also 
support use of CCT.13,14 The benefits of CCT might also 
result from community services being obliged to provide 
care instead of any direct effect on patient behaviour.15
The ethics and effectiveness of CCT continue to be 
debated, with previous systematic reviews finding that 
CCT is of uncertain benefit.1,4,8,16 A Cochrane review and 
meta-analysis of three random 
ised trials16 showed little to 
no effect of CCT compared with standard voluntary care. 
However, some researchers argue that participants 
entering these trials are likely to be unrepresentative of 
the population for whom the treatment is intended.5 For 
example, in the UK OCTET trial,17 psychiatrists giving 
treatment could exclude patients whom they felt would 
clearly benefit from CCT and found both treatment 
groups to be largely adherent to treatment at follow-up, 
suggesting people in randomised trials are not re-
presentative of the patients who do not engage with 
treatment for whom CCT is intended. The Cochrane 
review and meta-analysis16 found that the included 
randomised trials had major limitations resulting from 
difficulties in doing trials in a population who do not wish 
to cooperate and could pose a high risk; small samples, 
few trials, and selection bias were identified as key 
limitations in the validity of interpretations drawn from 
such trials. Thus, considering epidemiological studies of 
unselected clinical samples alongside these trials could 
enable improved analyses and understanding.
We aimed to update and quantify current knowledge of 
the effectiveness of CCT in reducing readmission to 
and length of stay in hospital, and increasing use 
of community services and treatment adherence for 
patients with severe mental illness. We include a 
substantial body of evidence from observational studies. 
Although these studies are more susceptible than 
randomised controlled trials to bias from differences 
between groups, they offer the advantage of improved 
representativeness of individuals undergoing CCT both 
nationally and internationally.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we developed a 
search strategy based on strategies used by Kisely and 
colleagues16 and Rugkåsa8 using keyword and subject 
searches containing generalised mental health and CCT-
specific terms. This review adhered to the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Compulsory community treatment (CCT) allows a legal 
requirement to be put in place for patients to maintain contact 
with mental health services or receive treatment in the 
community, or both. Evidence from the few trials done in this 
field suggest that CCT has little to no effect on outcomes, 
including admissions, but critiques of these trials suggest they 
might have a high risk of selection bias. A larger body of evidence 
exists from observational studies, and inclusion of these studies in 
decision making and analysis could have the advantages 
endowed by larger and more representative cohorts. We searched 
PsycINFO for systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in 
English between Jan 1, 1806, and Dec 31, 2017, using the search 
terms “community treatment order” or “CTO” or “Outpatient 
commitment” or “Civil commitment” and “meta-analys*” or 
“metasynthes*” or “meta-synthes*”. The search returned ten 
articles, three of which were relevant to our review (Maughan and 
colleagues [2014], Rugkåsa [2016], and Kisely [2107]); however, a 
quantitative synthesis of all quantitative designs on the 
effectiveness of CCT had not been done.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and 
meta-analysis of all quantitative randomised and 
non-randomised studies on CCT to date. We include both 
contemporaneous comparisons between patients released on 
CCT and those without CCT, and comparisons of patients before 
and after CCT. Before and after comparisons showed 
improvements across all outcomes, but contemporaneous 
comparisons (both randomised and non-randomised) showed 
little to no effect on readmission to and length of stay in hospital, 
or treatment adherence. In contemporaneous comparisons, 
some evidence supported increased use of community services 
with CCT, suggesting the treatment might be effective in 
increasing service provision or treatment attendance, or both. 
Treatment adherence was not consistently reported. Therefore, 
our results are mixed, but more methodologically robust designs 
indicate that CCT does not, as intended, reduce readmissions to 
or length of stay in hospital.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our findings do not clearly support CCT in the prevention of 
repeat admissions to hospital. Alternative methods of reducing 
repeat admission of compulsorily detained patients should be 
investigated—eg, by investing in more and better admission 
alternatives or community services on discharge than are 
currently available.

(PRISMA) guidelines.18 We developed a review protocol and 
adhered to it throughout the review process. We searched 
three electronic databases (PsychINFO, for articles 
published between Jan 1, 1806, and the fourth week of 
December, 2017; Embase, between Jan 1, 1974, and the first 
week of January, 2018; and MEDLINE, between Jan 1, 1946, 
and the fourth week of January, 2018) for publications in 
English, using the search terms “community treatment 
order” or “CTO” or “outpatient commitment” or 
“‘compulsory’ or ‘mandatory’ outpatient commitment” or 
“civil commitment” AND “SMI” or “psychiatric” or “manic” 
or “schizophrenia” or “bipolar”. We then applied a 
backwards reference search to the studies identified by 
manually searching reference lists of eligible studies. We 
also searched for articles that cited eligible studies using 
Scopus, and assessed those for eligibility. We searched 
review articles identified through the search to identify 
additional studies; however, no further studies were found 
(full search strategy is in the appendix).
Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed studies with 
samples in which the majority (>50%) of patients 
had severe mental illness, and peer-reviewed studies 
with CCT interventions, defined as legal compulsion on 
patients to remain in contact with mental health services 
or accept treatment in the community, or both. 
Interventions in which compulsion was in response to a 
criminal offence were excluded. We defined comparative 
treatments as those that did not consist of compulsory 
treatment in the community; the comparison did not 
have to be an alternative treatment, it could also have 
been no treatment at all (ie, release without compulsory 
treatment). Our primary outcome measure of interest 
was readmission to hospital. Secondary outcome 
measures of interest were length of hospital stay 
(ie, inpatient bed-days), use of community services, and 
treatment adherence. We extracted data on readmission 
to hospital regardless of whether the readmission was 
specified as compulsory or not, under the assumption 
that it was compulsory in each study, although some 
legal health-care frameworks (eg, in England) allow 
exceptions. Eligible study designs were quantitative 
randomised 
controlled 
trials, 
contemp 
oraneous 
controlled comparison studies comparing a group who 
were subject to CCT with a group not subject to CCT, 
and pre-post studies comparing service use by patients 
before and after the imposition of CCT. A summary of 
the study protocol is available online.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Two reviewers (PB, EM) screened the abstracts of all 
studies identified through the initial search and excluded 
those that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Full-text 
articles of eligible studies were then obtained and 
reviewed in duplicate, with conflicts resolved by 
discussion and where necessary consultation with a third 
reviewer (HM). PB and EM extracted data on study 
design, sample size, country, diagnosis, age, sex, race, 
admission history, length of follow-up, and outcome 
measures of interest with associated statistical data 
(ie, odds ratio or events data) using an electronic Microsoft 
Excel-based form. For outcomes of interest, we extracted 
summary estimates rather than individual-level data.
To assess the quality of observational studies, two raters 
(PB, EM)  used the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. This scale 
offers quality assessment scales for cohort and case-
control studies. The raters independently applied the 
scale to each study and discrepancies were resolved by 
discussion or consultation with a third reviewer (HM) if 
an agreement could not be reached. This nine point scale 
can be divided into three categories with a maximum 
number of items for each category: selection of study 
groups (four items), comparability of the groups 
(two items), and ascertain 
ment of exposure or outcome of 
interest (three items). Studies were awarded one point for 
each item within selection and exposure categories, and 
up to two points for items in the comparability category. 
Each study’s score was calculated by summing the total of 
these scores. Studies with a score of six or more were 
considered high quality, and studies with a score of less 
than six were considered low quality.19 To assess the 
methodological quality of randomised controlled trials,

we used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.20 We rated 
selection, perform 
ance, detection, attrition, and reporting 
bias as unclear, low, or high risk for each study.
Data analysis
We did a meta-analysis to compare disparate outcome 
measures between studies. To allow this comparison, we 
converted effect size statistics to standardised mean 
differences with 95% CIs using a random-effects model. 
This model assumes that the analysed studies are a 
random 
sample 
of 
effect 
sizes, 
enabling 
the 
generalisability of results,21 and we considered it 
appropriate for examining studies from a range of 
countries with differing CCT specifications. We included 
only unadjusted data in our analyses. We excluded 
publications that only provided data that we had already 
extracted. Data from studies with contemporaneous 
control groups and with before and after (pre-post) CCT 
designs were analysed separately. We considered results 
to be significant if their p value was less than 0·05. We 
did not apply corrections for multiple testing, but all tests 
were reported. We calculated heterogeneity between 
studies using I². A value of 0% indicates no observed 
heterogeneity, 25% low heterogeneity, 50% moderate 
heterogeneity, and 75% high heterogeneity.22 To minimise 
heterogeneity, we analysed data recorded at 12 months of 
follow-up. For studies that did not report data at 
12 months, we selected the timepoint at which data were 
collected that was closest after 12 months, or before 
12 months for shorter follow-ups. We used conventional 
values of effect size,23 with values around 0·2 indicating a 
small effect, 0·5 a moderate effect, and 0·8 a large effect. 
We separately analysed studies comparing the same 
sample before and after CCT and studies comparing 
patients on CCT to controls. For studies that reported 
both comparisons, we extracted and analysed data 
for both. We assessed the degree of publication bias 
(ie, the preferential publication of studies with positive

examination of a funnel plot. We did two sensitivity 
analyses to test a priori assumptions that inclusion of 
only primary outcomes or adjusted data might influence 
our findings. The first analysis included only primary 
outcomes as identified by the authors of the study and 
the second included adjusted data when unadjusted data 
were unavailable. We did four meta-regressions on 
publication year, follow-up duration, study quality, and 
country on the main outcome of readmission to hospital.

Results
Of 1931 studies found, 170 (9%) were identified as 
potentially relevant full-text articles and were reviewed 
for eligibility (figure 1). 41 (24%) of 170 studies provided 
sufficient data comparing CCT with controls or 
comparing data recorded after the intervention to data 
recorded before the intervention for our selected 
outcomes, and were included in our systematic review 
(n=189 749); 39 studies (n=57 746) were included in our 
meta-analysis (two studies were excluded for not 
having data in the correct format for analysis). Study 
characteristics for all 41 studies are summarised in 
table 1, and risk of bias for randomised controlled trials is 
shown in figure 2. Of 41 studies, unadjusted data were 
available on readmission to hospital in 30 (73%), 
inpatient bed-days in 26 (63%), community services in 
14 (34%), and treatment adherence in five (12%). One 
study41 did not have unadjusted data on outcomes of 
interest, and so it was not included in the main meta-
analysis. One study28 reported only hazard ratios, which 
could not be combined with other studies in a meta-
analysis, so was excluded. Studies with a pre-post design 
most frequently followed up patients before and after 
they were put on CCT, although some provided 
population statistics before and after the introduction 
of CCT legis 
lation. In all studies comparing CCT with a 
control group, all comparisons assumed a control of 
patients who had been voluntarily discharged, except 
for two studies: one study used extended leave as a 
comparator24 and one study used patients who remained 
under section in hospital as a comparator.30 We saw a 
high degree of variability in study quality, with ratings for 
observational studies ranging from three to nine. Bias as 
measured by the study quality rating most frequently 
concentrated on poor comparability between CCT and 
control participants.
Effect sizes with 95% CIs from pre-post studies are 
shown in table 2. 17 studies had before and after CCT 
comparisons and four studies had both before and 
after and control group comparisons (relevant data 
from these studies were included separately in each 
analysis), including 9455 participants from six countries 
(England, Scotland, Australia, the USA, Canada, and 
Spain). We saw a medium effect for reduction in 
inpatient bed-days (standardised mean difference 0·66, 
95% CI 0·46–0·85), and a large effect for reduction 
in readmission to hospital (0·80, 0·53–1·08), increase 
in use of community services (0·83, 0·46–1·21), and 
increase in treatment adherence (2·12, 1·69–2·55).
Effect sizes for contemporaneous comparisons of 
patients on CCT with controls are shown in table 3. 
20 studies had this design, of which 16 were non-
randomised and four were randomised studies, and four 
studies had both before and after and control group 
comparisons. These studies included 181 150 participants 
from five countries (England, Australia, the USA, 
Canada, and Spain). No effect was seen in reducing

readmission 
to 
hospital 
(standardised 
mean 
difference –0·14, 95% CI –0·41 to 0·14) or inpatient bed-
days (0·13, –0·08 to 0·34), a moderate effect was seen for 
increase 
in 
use 
of 
community 
services 
(0·38, 
0·19 to 0·58), and a large but non-significant effect was 
seen for increase in treatment adherence (0·91, 
–0·70 to 2·51). Figure 3 shows forest plots for readmission 
to hospital for both before and after and control 
comparisons; plots for other outcomes of interest and for 
analyses of studies in which rates (ie, risk ratios for the 
control comparison, and rate ratios for the pre-post 
comparison) were reported for readmission are presented 
in the appendix.
Reduction in readmission to hospital remained non-
significant when separately analysing randomised 
controlled trials (three studies, standardised mean 
difference –0·08, 95% CI –0·26 to 0·41), and non-
randomised studies (14 studies, –0·18, –0·49 to 0·12). 
Reduction in inpatient bed-days also remained non-
significant when separately analysing randomised con-
trolled trials (two studies, 0·25, –0·11 to 0·61) and 
non-randomised studies (nine studies, 0·10, –0·14 to 0·33). 
Increase in use of community services remained 
significant when non-randomised studies were analysed 
separately (seven studies, 0·46, 0·24 to 0·67) but became 
non-significant when only randomised controlled trials 
were analysed (two studies, 0·13, –0·03 to 0·29; appendix).
Both sensitivity analyses resulted in only a marginal 
change in effect sizes for each outcome, except for 
treatment adherence for which the non-significant 
effect was reduced (tables 4 and 5).
In our meta-regressions for readmission to hospital, 
year of publication was a significant moderator for both 
before and after CCT (11 studies, R²=0·49; p=0·0022) 
and control comparisons (13 studies, R²=0·71; p=0·0002; 
appendix). Although different publication years predicted 
different effects of CCT on readmission to hospital, no 
consistent trend over time was observed. Duration of 
follow-up was not a significant moderator of before and 
after CCT comparisons (11 studies, R²=0·00; p=0·73), 
but it was significant for comparison of CCT with a 
control (13 studies, R²=0·20; p=0·0228). Country of 
study was not a significant moderator for before and 
after CCT (11 studies, R²=0·00; p=0·3574) or control 
comparisons (13 studies, R²=0·00; p=0·9479). Study 
quality was not a significant moderator for before and 
after comparisons (11 studies, R²=0·00; p=0·5628) or 
control comparisons (13 studies, R²=0·16; p=0·1013). 
Scatter plots for meta-regressions are in the appendix. 
There was insufficient data to analyse outcomes in only 
children, only women, or according to ethnicity. Visual 
examination of the funnel plots showed little publication 
bias in our estimate of CCT effectiveness (appendix). A 
high level of heterogeneity was observed for readmission 
to hospital, inpatient bed-days, and use of community 
services, and a low level of heterogeneity for treatment 
adherence (tables 2 and 3).
Discussion
In this meta-analysis we found that CCT does not have a 
clear positive effect on readmission and use of inpatient 
beds. Evidence suggested a potentially positive effect on 
treatment adherence, although this result should be 
interpreted with caution because of the small number of 
studies included in the analysis. Although CCT might 
result in increased community service availability, in the 
absence of clear, consistent evidence on clinical benefits, 
and the removal of patient liberty involved, this effect is 
probably insufficient to justify use of CCT. Our review 
suggests a need to critically examine the future justification 
for CCT.
In this systematic review and meta-analysis we provide 
an updated synthesis of the available evidence for all 
empirical research on, and quantify the effectiveness of, 
CCT. Existing evidence has suggested little to no effect, 
calling into question the reasoning for implementation of 
CCT in policy.1,4,8 Our meta-analysis was broader than 
previous analyses because, in addition to randomised

controlled trials, we included other study designs, such as 
non-randomised designs that can have less selection bias 
and provide larger samples than randomised trials. We 
analysed studies with contemporaneous control groups, 
and studies with a before and after (pre-post) CCT design 
separately. The emerging results varied substantially, with 
high levels of heterogeneity observed across outcome 
measures despite our attempts to separate designs. This 
heterogeneity was probably a result of varying policies, 
ethnicities, sexes, ages, and treatments in the inter-
national studies included, which further complicated the 
task of disentangling the results. Before and after studies 
suggested that patients are substantially less likely to be 
readmitted to hospital after CCT than before CCT. 
However, the particular problems associated with designs 
of this type have been frequently noted in the 
methodological literature,64 and include regression to the 
mean and maturation effects. For example, if CCT is 
used at the end of a long stay in hospital, subsequent 
improvement could simply reflect regression to the 
clinical mean due to the apparent cyclical nature of illness 
severity.16 Thus, overall we believe the conservative view 
that CCT does not clearly show benefits is supported by 
the evidence, which is a view supported by randomised 
controlled trials and observational studies in which 
contemporaneous comparisons have been made, although 
the potential effects of confounding in natural experiments 
are an important limitation that should be considered.
Our meta-regression analyses identified two significant 
covariates: duration of follow-up and publication date. 
These factors account for a proportion of variance in 
readmission to hospital; however, no evidence exists to 
support a clear pattern for these covariates—eg, our 
evidence does not suggest that CCT produces better 
outcomes in studies published more recently or in studies 
with a longer follow-up period. Study quality varied 
substantially; however, our meta-regressions did not find 
an association between study quality and outcome. 
Overall, our findings indicate patients on CCT used more 
community services after discharge from hospital than 
those not on CCT and than they did before CCT; however, 
this finding could indicate that people on CCT were 
offered more services than others. This finding raises the 
question of whether compulsion is necessary if indeed it 
does not reduce readmission to hospital compared with 
no CCT.3,10 Only a few studies15,33,41,45,55 have reported 
adherence to treatment; hence, this outcome measure 
requires increased attention in future empirical research 
because it is central to arguments for compulsion in 
community treatment.1
This study has several limitations. Most studies included 
in our analysis were observational, with a non-randomised 
comparison of CCT with either a non-compulsory group 
or the time before admission to hospital, both of which are 
problematic for group comparability. The heterogeneity 
observed could be a result of this issue because patients 
who are severely ill are more often released with 
compulsory orders than without such orders.39 Random-
ised controlled trials have attempted to overcome this 
problem, but only four have been published to date, and 
difficulties regarding ethical considerations and problems 
with overly selected samples that might not be re-
presentative of the target population remain a key hurdle.17 
Therefore, we believe interpretation of findings from an 
overview of both randomised and non-randomised 
evidence to be preferable to either in isolation. Another 
limitation was that insufficient data were available to do 
prespecified subgroup analyses to investigate outcomes of 
CCT for children, women, and ethnic groups. Analyses in

Panel: Message from the National Institute for Health Research Lived Experience 
Working Group
As service users and carers, we are not inspired by measures of readmissions and inpatient 
bed-days; we want to know what difference interventions make to the quality of people’s 
lives and wellbeing. Although data on such outcomes are disappointingly missing from the 
literature, the evidence that researchers have analysed in this systematic review still paves 
the way for a prompt review of the use of compulsory community treatments (CCTs). We 
hope that future work will address the glaring omissions in existing data that have been 
highlighted by this study. Ethnicity is a fundamental aspect that influences the 
disproportionate use of CCTs in specific groups. As increased emphasis is placed on a 
biopsychosocial model, data on accommodation, employment, and community networks 
need to be included, alongside the role of carers and the effect on family. We are also 
interested in who is subject to CCT. We want to see a fuller picture of the experiences of 
specific groups, including black African Caribbean men, women labelled with personality 
disorders, and young people with learning disabilities. For the moment, this study, like all 
previous studies, suggests that CCTs have little effect on inpatient services, but have some 
effect on the use of community services. But would coercion be needed if people could 
easily access appropriate community services? And also, how many studies coming to the 
same conclusion does it take before action is taken?

these populations have been specifically recommended by 
the National Institute for Health Research Lived 
Experience Working Group as a focus for future work 
(panel). Also, two studies could not be included in the 
meta-analysis because they did not report unadjusted or 
compatible data,28,41 and the required data could not be 
obtained from the authors. Although we recognise the 
argument for the use of adjusted data to control for other 
potential moderators of mental health outcomes, we used 
un 
adjusted data in our analyses because only a few studies 
that were identified as eligible reported adjusted data, and 
those studies had large differences in the number and 
types of variables controlled. However, our sensitivity 
analysis that included adjusted data did not give 
substantially different results from the main analyses. 
Despite this fact, our analyses should be interpreted with 
the understanding that several other possible variables—
eg, diagnosis, ethnicity, comorbidities, country, and 
criminal convictions6,36,65—could also have a key role in the 
effect of CCT. Additionally, other important outcomes, 
particularly associated with patient experience and risk 
(eg, number of deaths or negative experience) could be 
relevant to policy making regarding CCT, but were 
insufficiently reported in the literature for inclusion in our 
analyses.
Our findings in this review have important implications 
for practice and policy. We suggest that evidence of 
improvement in patient outcomes after CCT compared 
with before inpatient admission is insufficient without 
additional consistent evidence for their effect 
ive 
ness in 
reducing readmission to hospital through more methodo-
logically robust designs. Addition 
ally, the potential 
increased cost and coercive nature of CCT is difficult to 
justify without more consistent evidence. Alternative 
investments in providing more accessible, high quality 
community support than currently available could result in 
increased benefits—eg, advance directives and joint crisis 
plans have shown some benefits in reducing compulsory 
admissions.66 Other alternative approaches could involve 
enhancing the quality of inpatient care—such as improving 
under 
standing of why some people do not engage with the 
treatment that they are offered and what might make treat-
ment more acceptable, and inter 
ventions designed with 
service users focused on engaging and preventing relapse 
among those with a history of compulsory admission. 
Some clinical groups might also benefit more from CCTs 
than others—eg, those with more severe illness who are 
typically excluded from randomised controlled trials and 
who might have contributed to our significant pre-post 
findings. The increasing availability of large routine 
datasets could allow this avenue to be explored in future.
