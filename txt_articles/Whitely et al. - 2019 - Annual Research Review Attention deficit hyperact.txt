effect is the norm and whether the strength of effect is related to the absolute risk of being diagnosed/medicated.
Methods: A literature search of the PubMed and ERIC databases and snowball and grey literature searching were
conducted. Results: A total of 19 studies in 13 countries covering over 15.4 million children investigating this
relationship were identified. Three other studies exploring related topics were identified. The diversity of methodologies
prevented a meta-analysis. Instead a systematic review of the 22 studies was conducted. A total of 17 of the 19 studies
found that the youngest children in a school year were considerably more likely to be diagnosed and/or medicated than
their older classmates. Two Danish studies found either a weak or no late birth date effect. There was no consistent
relationship between per-capita diagnosis or medication rates and the strength of the relative age effect, with strong
effects reported in most jurisdictions with comparatively low rates. Conclusions: It is the norm internationally for the

low prescribing rates. A lack of a strong effect in Denmark may be accounted for by the common practice of academic
‘redshirting’,wherechildrenjudgedbyparentsasimmaturehaveadelayedschoolstart.Redshirtingmaypreventand/or

jurisdictions with comparatively low diagnosis/medication rates challenges the notion that low rates indicate sound
diagnostic practices. Keywords: ADHD; relative age; late birthdate.
Introduction
Despite being one of the most commonly diagnosed
and medicated childhood psychiatric disorders in the
world, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
is a controversial diagnostic entity. Much of the con-
troversy stems from the fact that the diagnosis is based
on third-party (often teacher and parent) reports of
behaviour, because ‘no biological marker is diagnostic
for ADHD’ (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
These behaviours – which include making careless
mistakes, not seeming to listen, not following through
on instructions, disliking homework, losing things,
being forgetful in daily activities, fidgeting, climbing
excessively, having difficulty playing quietly, talking
excessively and interrupting – are often displayed in
school settings (American Psychiatric Association,
2005). Although paediatricians, psychiatrists and, in
some jurisdictions, non-specialist medical doctors
formally diagnose ADHD, teachers usually play a
central role by providing an assessment of a child’s
behaviour. Furthermore, a 2003 US study found that,
in most cases, teachers were the first to suggest a
diagnosis (Sax & Kautz, 2003).
Relative age or late birthdate effects, where the
oldest children in educational or sporting age-based
cohorts tend to outperform and have better mental
health outcomes than their younger peers, have long
been recognised (Bell & Daniels, 1990). A study of
10,438 British 5–15-year-olds found that younger
children in a school year were more likely to be
diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder (Goodman,
Gledhill, & Ford, 2003). In recent years, there has
been a focus on relative age effects on the diagnosis
and treatment of childhood ADHD. This study con-
solidates international evidence of the ADHD late
birthdate effect and investigates the relationship
between the strength of the effect and absolute rates
of diagnosis and/or medication use.

On the same date, a literature search of the ERIC database
(Education Resources Information Center sponsored by US
Department of Education) was also conducted, using identical
terms. In addition, snowball and grey literature searching were
conducted.
Selection criteria
Any study published in English that identified statistical
information in relation to the probability of being diagnosed
with or medicated for ADHD (or Attention Deficit Disorder or
Hyperkinetic Disorder) and relative age (date or month of
birth) was included. This encompassed studies that were
designed
to
investigate
the
relationship
and
those
that
incidentally provided this information (e.g. studies investigat-
ing the effect of season of birth on ADHD diagnosis or
medication use). The main variables identified in each study
were the relative risk of late born (compared with early born)
children in a recommended school year cohort being medi-
cated and/or diagnosed, and the proportion of children in
each study of children being medicated and/or diagnosed.
The specific measures used in each study (calendar month or
months for comparison and age range of students) vary
between studies.
The review was conducted in accordance with preferred
reporting for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA)
guidelines (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, & Altman, 2009). As no
patients or members of the public were involved, and this
study involved the review of publicly available documents, no
ethics committee approval was required.
Results
Figure 1 below summarises the literature search
process method. The PubMed search identified 152
papers; however, only 16 were relevant to this study.
Three of these papers (letters to the editor etc.)
related to other papers which are all discussed in
this review and offered no additional relevant infor-
mation and were thus excluded. No extra relevant
studies were identified among the 47 papers identi-
fied in the ERIC search. Initial grey literature search
identified three more studies, while snowball search
of the 16 relevant records identified six additional
studies not identified by the PubMed or ERIC
searches, leaving a total of 22 studies for inclusion.
Of these 22 studies, 19 explored the relationship
between late birthdate within school intake cohorts
and ADHD diagnosis. Of the 19 studies, 15 reported
medication use and only nine reported diagnosis
rates. Three other studies explored related topics
(season of birth and ADHD, birthdate and adult
ADHD symptomology). The diversity of methodolo-
gies in the studies meant that it was not appropriate
to undertake a meta-analysis. Instead the 19 studies
(conducted in 13 countries) are discussed separately.
A total of 17 studies – five in the USA, two in Spain
and one each in Canada, Finland, Germany, Hol-
land, Iceland, Israel, Norway, Sweden, Taiwan and
Australia – found that children who were the young-
est in their school year were more likely than their
classmates to be medicated for, and/or diagnosed
with, ADHD. Two Danish studies found a weak or no
late birthdate effect. These 19 studies have a com-
bined total population of over 15,400,000 children
(approximate medication rate of 2.4% among the 15
studies that reported medication use). They are
discussed below, and summarised in Appendix S1,
with studies from the same country grouped together
in descending order of the total number of children
in the largest study in a country.
Large studies investigating the late birthdate effect
for ADHD
Ten of the largest eleven studies are population-wide
studies in nine countries that each cover at least
310,000 children, with a minimum 5,900 medicated
or diagnosed. The remaining smaller studies each
had a total population of less than 35,000 children,
with fewer than 2,000 medicated. As discussed
below, the two large scale studies from Denmark
(Dalsgaard, Humlum, Nielsen, & Simonsen, 2014;
Pottegard, Hallas, Hernandez, & Zoega, 2014) have
significant cohort overlap, with the larger of the two
(Pottegard
et al.,
2014)
having
a
more
robust
methodology. The key measures (mean medication
rate and late birthdate effect) of nine of these 10
large-scale studies (Dalsgaard et al., 2014 is not
included) are plotted in Figure 2. Following this,
another large scale study (Boland, Shahn, Madigan,
Hripcsak, & Tatonetti, 2015) that reviewed the
relationship between date of birth and a range of
diseases and eight smaller studies that investigate
the ADHD late birthdate effect, and then three other
related studies are discussed.
The largest of the studies is a German study
(Schwandt & Wuppermann, 2016) that reviewed the
health insurance records from 2008 to 2011 of
roughly 7.2 million children (approximately 90% of
all German children aged 9–13 in this period). A
number of children – most of whom were out of their
recommended age group school cohort (primarily
entry delayed for a year) – were excluded, so the final
number analysed was 6,585,039. The proportion of
9–13 year-olds reported as receiving medication over
the 4 years was 2.7%, with 3.8% reported as having
been diagnosed with ADHD. The study reviewed
records from 16 German states with different school
entry cut-off dates. Among children aged 9–13 at any
time between 2008 and 2011, researchers found
large increases in ADHD rates around cut-off dates,
amounting to a 22% increased risk for the youngest
children in an age cohort (born the last month before
the cut-off) compared with children born just after
them who were the oldest (first month) in the next
age cohort. These changes occurred ‘at different
months across [German] states in accordance with
the different cut-off dates’.

ADHD late birthdate effect a global norm
381
 The late birthdate effects demonstrated in the
study were weaker in the first two grades and peaked
in fourth and fifth grade, before moderating in later
grades. One factor identified as a possible explana-
tion for this trend was that academic performance
becomes important in third and particularly fourth
grade, and new ADHD diagnoses of relatively young
children may occur then as a response to age-related
differences in academic performance (Schwandt &
Wuppermann, 2016).
The Swedish study (Halldner et al., 2014) reviewed
the records of all people born from 1940 onwards,
and residing in Sweden during July 2005 to Decem-
ber 2009. This included 1,821,939 children aged 6–
17 years, of whom 17,565 (0.96%) received medica-
tion (calculated from Halldner et al., 2014 table 1, p.
899). Children born in November and December had
a 39% higher risk of being medicated and a 30%
higher risk of being diagnosed than their oldest
classmates (born the previous January and Febru-
ary). This late birthdate effect was strongest in
children aged 6–7 (70% increased medication use
risk) and decreased progressively among older chil-
dren (20% increased medication use risk among
adolescents aged 16 and 17). The late birthdate
effect tapered further in early adulthood, so that
after age 35 there was no discernible difference. The
study also reviewed diagnosis status, and similar
patterns were displayed. Despite the relative age
differences, the authors found no differences in
parent or self-reported ADHD symptoms by birth
month. This was one of only two studies that
reported the relationship between month of birth
and parent-reported ADHD symptoms.
In contrast to all other studies that reported both
diagnosis and medication rates, the diagnosis rate
(0.6%) in the Swedish study (for children aged 6–17)
was considerably lower than the medication rate
(0.96%). However, this study reported the proportion
of children with a diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder
as defined in ICD-10. For many psychiatric disor-
ders, including ADHD, diagnostic rates using DSM
criteria are significantly higher than those using the
equivalent disorder in ICD-10 (Sorensen, Mors, &

Martin Whitely et al.
J Child Psychol Psychiatr 2019; 60(4): 380–91
 Thomsen, 2005). It may be that some Swedish
children who met the broader diagnostic criteria for
ADHD, but were not diagnosed with Hyperkinetic
Disorder, received medication.
A Danish study (Pottegard et al., 2014) reviewed
the records of 1,209,901 children aged 7–12, includ-
ing 932,032 children in their recommended school
year, of whom 10,932 (1.2%) received medication.
Among children in their recommended school year
across the period 2000–2011, there was an average
8% increased risk (95% CI: 1.04–1.12) for children
born between October and December (the youngest)
compared with their older classmates born between
January and March (the oldest).
In Denmark, the recommended school year intake
matches the calendar year. However, it is very
common in Denmark for late-born children to have
delayed school entry, with 40% of children (boys
51%, girls 29%) born in October, November and
December starting late, compared to only 4% of
children born in January, February or March (Pot-
tegard et al., 2014). The authors proposed that ‘the
high proportion of relatively young children with
delayed school entry in Denmark may play a role in
the near absence of a relative age effect’.
Another large Danish study (Dalsgaard et al.,
2014) with an overlapping sample, was published
shortly before the research led by Potteg�
ard. It
included many of the same children, but the sample
was only 35% of the size. It reviewed the records of all
418,396 children born between July 1990 and June
2001, of whom 8,720 (2.1%) children ‘purchased’
ADHD medication after the age of seven. The authors
found no effect of ‘being born in the beginning of
January compared to the end of December on the
likelihood of having purchased ADHD medication’
(OR 1.0014, 95% CI: 0.9996–1.0031).
According to Dalsgaard et al. ‘In Denmark, school
entry rules imply that children born in December are
typically enrolled in school 1 year earlier than chil-
dren born in January’. The paper makes no reference
to the effect of the very common Danish practice of
delayed entry for late-born children, particularly
boys. The lead author was contacted to confirm
whether ‘the calculation of relative risk in your paper
was based on the assumption that all children started
school in line with these school entry rules’; but he did
not respond. If, as appears likely, no adjustment was
made for late starters, this would have hidden any late
birthdate effect, because a disproportionate number
of nominally young, late-born children (born in
December) would actually be among the oldest in
their class. As Danish data from the more robust
study led by Pottegard et al. (2014) are included in
Figure 2, the results of this study are omitted there.
Elsewhere, Dalsgaard et al. have suggested that the
lack of a late birthdate effect in Denmark may be due
to diagnostic practices being less subjective because
only specialists can diagnose ADHD (Dalsgaard,
Humlumb, Nielsen, & Simonsen, 2012). However, in
most other studies where a strong late birthdate effect
exists, diagnosis is also restricted to specialists.

ADHD late birthdate effect a global norm
383
 The Israeli study (Hoshen, Benis, Keyes, & Zoega,
2016) reviewed the records of 1,013,149 children
aged between 6 and 17 years from 2006 to 2011, and
found rising rates of ‘one-year prevalence’ use of
ADHD stimulant prescribing, from 2.6% in 2006 to
4.9% in 2011. The youngest third of children in class
– born August to November – were more likely to use
medication than the oldest third – born December to
March – (risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95% confidence inter-
val (CI) 1.12–1.23) or the middle third (RR 1.06, 95%
CI: 1.01–1.11). As in the Swedish study, the late
birthdate effect ‘diminished as children were older in
absolute age’ (Hoshen et al., 2016).
An important limitation of the Israeli study is that
researchers could not identify children who had been
‘accelerated or delayed from the expected grade level’
(Hoshen et al., 2016). It is likely that the increasingly
common Israeli practice of delayed entry for late-
born children partly explains why the late birthdate
effect was not as strong as in other studies (Hoshen
et al., 2016).
The
Canadian
study
(Morrow
et al.,
2012)
reviewed the records of 937,943 children in British
Columbia, aged 6–12 years at any time between 1
December 1997 and 30 November 2008. Approxi-
mately 33,775 (3.6%) of these children received
medication at some time (calculated from Morrow
et al., 2012 table 1, p. 756). There was an increased
risk of both being diagnosed (boys +30%, 95% CI:
1.23–1.37; girl s + 70%, 95% CI: 1.53–1.88) and
taking medication (boys +41%, 95% CI: 1.33–1.50;
girls +77%, 95% CI: 1.57–2.00) for the youngest
children in a class (born in December) compared
with the oldest (born the previous January).
The strength of the late birthdate effect remained
relatively
stable
throughout
the
11-year
study,
despite increasing diagnosis and medication rates.
The effect was present among all age groups of
children but, as with the Swedish and Israeli studies,
was weaker in older children. The risk for medication
use rose month by month for both genders from
January to September, and plateaued from Septem-
ber to December. The authors suggest this plateau-
ing may occur because late-born children (born in
October to December) who show ADHD type beha-
vioural problems may be held back a year, giving
them more time to develop sociable behaviours.
The Finnish study (Sayal, Chudal, Hinkka-Yli-
Salomaki, Joelsson, & Sourander, 2017) examined
the birth month distribution of 870,695 children
aged 7–19, of whom 6,136 (0.7%) were ever diag-
nosed with ADHD. The chances of a child being
diagnosed before age 10 were 64% higher (95% CI:
1.48–1.81) for the youngest third in a class (born
September to December) compared with their older
classmates born from January to April. The effect
was not as strong among older children. Across the
entire 7–19 age range, boys born between September
and December were 26% (95% CI: 1.18–1.35) more
likely to be diagnosed than boys born from January
to April. For girls aged 7–19, the increased risk was
31% (95% CI: 1.12–1.54). For both genders com-
bined, there was a 27% increased risk of diagnosis
(calculated from Sayal et al., 2017 table 2, p. 5).
The
Norwegian
study
(Karlstad
et al.,
2016)
reviewed the records of all Norwegian children born
between 1998 and 2006 from their sixth birthday
until 31 December 2014. In Norway, delayed (or
early) enrolments are rare (Karlstad et al., 2016). Of
the 509,827 children aged 6–16, 15,717 (3.1%)
received ADHD medication at some time during this
period and 3.4% were diagnosed. Boys born from
October to December (the youngest children in a
class) had a 41% (adjusted hazard ratio 1.4, 95% CI:
1.4–1.5) higher rate of medication and a 43% higher
diagnosis rate than older boys born from January to
March of the same year. For late-born girls, the
elevated medication risk was +79% (adjusted hazard
ratio 1.8, 95% CI: 1.7–2.0), with an increased
diagnosis rate of +75% (percentages calculated from
Karlstad et al., 2016 table 1, p. 345). A supplemen-
tary analysis restricted to 17,017 siblings from 7,690
mothers, adjusted for gender and age, revealed a
70% greater risk of ADHD medication use for late-
born children (October to December) compared with
their early-born siblings (January to March).
Unlike most of the other studies, the late birthdate
effect was most marked in higher grades. In Norway,
the first testing of academic performance occurs late
in grades four and five, coinciding with an increase
in the strength of the late birthdate effect (Karlstad
et al., 2016).
In the Taiwanese study (Chen et al., 2016), the
total population of children was 378,881, of whom
6,062 (1.6%) received medication and 2.3% had ever
been diagnosed. Among children aged 4–17, there
was 65% (95% CI: 1.48–1.83) increased risk (boys
+63%, girls +71%) of being diagnosed and a 73%
(95% CI: 1.53–1.97) increased risk (boys +76%, girls
+65%) of taking medication for the youngest children
in a class (born in August) compared with the oldest
(born the previous September). The late birthdate
effect was stronger in early school years than in later
school years.
The Australian study (Whitely, Lester, Phillimore,
& Robinson, 2017) examined the birth month distri-
bution of 311,384 Western Australian children aged
6–15, of whom 5,937 (1.9%) received medication
(4,677 [2.9%] of 158,675 boys; 1,260 [0.8%] of
152,709 girls - not reported in original study). There
was a high degree of compliance with recommended
age input (98%) and, to the limited extent that it
occurs, most out-of-year children were late-born
children with delayed entry. For children aged 6–
10, the youngest in a class (born in June) were
approximately twice as likely (boys RR 1.93, 95% CI:
1.53–2.38; girls 2.11, 95% CI: 1.57–2.53) to take
medication as the oldest (born the previous July).
For children aged 11–15, those born in June were
30% more likely (boys 1.26, 95% CI: 1.30–1.52; girls

 1.43, 95% CI: 1.15–1.76) to be medicated than those
born the previous July. The increased risk for all
children (both genders combined) was 57% (not
reported in original study). Similar patterns were
found when comparing children born in the first
three (or six) months and the last three (or six)
months of the school-year intake.
Figure 2 (above) is a scatter diagram showing the
medication rate (diagnosis rate for the Finnish study)
versus relative risk for the nine countries in which
large studies have been conducted. The smallest of
these studies had a total population of over 310,000.
The largest study with both population and diagno-
sis/medication data not included in the scatter
diagram had a total population of less than 35,000
children.
All nine studies found a tendency for relatively
young children to be medicated/diagnosed at a
higher rate than their older classmates (ranging
from 1.08 in Denmark through to 1.65 in Taiwan).
However, there is no consistent relationship between
the prescribing rate and the strength of the late
birthdate effect. If anything, there is a weak inverse
relationship (lower medication rate associated with a
stronger effect), but there are differences in method-
ology – particularly diverse age ranges and the extent
of unidentified delayed school entry – that make
direct comparisons problematic. For example, the
inclusion of 18 and 19 year-olds in the Finnish study
is likely to have reduced the strength of the reported
late birthdate effect (based on diagnosis rather than
prescribing). The most obvious conclusion that can
be drawn from these nine studies is that the late
birthdate effect occurs in both high and low pre-
scribing/diagnosing jurisdictions.
Another very large study (Boland et al., 2015)
reviewed a New York Medical Centre’s records for
1,749,000 individuals born between 1990 and 2000,
and examined the association between 1,688 dis-
eases and birth month. It found a rising trend across
the year for the diagnosis of ADHD, peaking in
November. In New York the school intake year
mirrors the calendar year, with the youngest chil-
dren born in December. The study did not report
absolute medication or diagnosis rates and therefore
could not be plotted in Figure 2.
Smaller studies investigating the late birthdate
effect
The largest of the studies conducted in the USA that
focussed solely on ADHD (Evans, Morrill, & Parente,
2010) reviewed the diagnosis and medication use
data for children from multiple US states from three
different sources, the National Health Interview
Survey (NHIS) (1997–2006), the Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey (MEPS) (1996–2006) and private claims
data (2003–2006). It compared diagnosis and med-
ication rates for children born in the 120 days after
the school start cut-off date (the oldest in class) with
those of children born in the 120 days before the cut-
off (the youngest). The NHIS data included 53,212
person/year observations. 9.7% of the youngest, and
7.6% of the oldest, were diagnosed. The MPES data
included 47,423 person/year observations. 4.5% of
the youngest, and 4.0% of the oldest, used stimu-
lants. The private claims data (2003–2006) included
72,885
person/year
observations.
6.5%
of
the
youngest, and 5.2% of the oldest, used stimulants.
The authors concluded that children born in the
120 days after the cut-off date (the oldest in class)
had a significantly lower risk of being diagnosed and
being prescribed stimulants than those born in the
120 days before the cut-off (the youngest; Evans
et al., 2010).
The authors also discussed how academic red-
shirting (delayed entry) was most common among
late-born children, especially boys, and ‘children
with diagnosed development problems were more
than twice as likely as those without such diagnoses
to have delayed entry’ (Evans et al., 2010). Like the
Israeli study, this may result in an underestimation
of the strength of the late birthdate effect.
Another US study (Elder, 2010) used data from a
nationwide longitudinal survey of health and well-
being for 11,784 children from 1998 to 2007. By
2007, when most children were in eighth grade (aged
approximately 13), 6.4% were diagnosed with ADHD
and 4.5% regularly used stimulants. In fifth grade,
when the children were approximately 10 years old,
those children born fewer than 181 days before their
state’s cut-off date (the youngest) were roughly 50%
more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD (7.5% vs.
5.1%) and to use behavioural medications (5.4% vs.
3.5%) than those born fewer than 181 days after the
cut-off date.
The study, the second of the two studies that
reported the relationship between month of birth
and parent-reported ADHD symptoms, also found
that a child’s birthdate ‘strongly influences teachers’
assessments of whether the child exhibits ADHD
symptoms but is only weakly associated with similarly
measured parental assessments’. This study built on
prior research by the same lead author that found
evidence of a range of relative age effects, including
increased probability of grade repetition and diag-
noses of learning disabilities such as ADHD. An
additional year of age at entry of kindergarten was
found to decrease the probability of an ADD or ADHD
diagnosis by two-thirds (Elder & Darren, 2009).
An earlier US study (Schneider & Eisenberg, 2006)
examined 2002 data from a nationally representative
sample of 9,278 mostly third grade children. 5.44%
of these students had been diagnosed with ADHD.
Information about medication use was not collected.
The study found that relatively younger children
(born in the last 3 months of their school intake year)
were 69% more likely to have been diagnosed than
those born in the first 3 months (OR: 1.69, 95% CI:
1.10–2.61).

ADHD late birthdate effect a global norm
385
 The first published research ever to suggest an
ADHD relative age effect was a US study (LeFever,
Dawson, & Morrow, 1999). It reviewed the records of
2,177 children who were ‘young-for-grade’ (a year or
younger than expected age for grade) or ‘old-for-
grade’ at public schools in two US cities. It concluded
that ‘being young for one’s grade was positively
associated
with
medication
use’
(LeFever
et al.,
1999). However, there were conflicting results, with
a very strong extra medication risk in one city and,
paradoxically, a reverse late birthdate effect in the
other. In city B, 62.7% of young-for-grade students
and 10.1% of old-for-grade students were medicated
for ADHD. In contrast, in city A, 3.7% of young-for-
grade students and 12.4% of old-for-grade students
were medicated. Because, unlike all the other stud-
ies reviewed here, it analysed the relative age effect in
children who were well outside their recommended
year, it is of limited relevance to the late birthdate
effect in children within the recommended year
group.
In a Spanish study (Librero, Izquierdo-Maria,
Garcia-Gil, & Peiro, 2015) data from 2013 were
obtained from the information systems of the Valen-
cia Ministry of Health for 20,237 children aged 6–
12 years, of whom 1.73% were treated for ADHD
(boys: 2.70%; girls: 0.71%). The prevalence of phar-
macological treatment in the youngest children (born
in the 6 months from July to December) was 51%
higher than in their older classmates (born from
January to June) (calculated from Librero et al.,
2015 table 1, p. 473). Another Spanish study (Rivas-
Juesas, Gonzalez de Dios, Benac-Prefaci, Fernan-
dez-Martinez, & Colomer-Revuelta, 2015) reviewed
the records of 3,469 patients who attended a child
neurology clinic between 1992 and 2012. 61.6% of
those with suspected ADHD were born between July
and December.
An Icelandic study (Zoega, Valdimarsdottir, &
Hernandez-Diaz, 2012) reviewed the data from all
children born in Iceland in 1994, 1995 and 1996 for
whom academic and health records were available.
Of the 11,785 children in the study 740 (6.3%)
received stimulant medication at some time between
2003 and 2008. Children in the youngest third of a
class (born between September and December) had a
50% higher likelihood of receiving stimulants (8.0%
compared to 5.3%) than the oldest third (born
between January and April).
A study in the Netherlands (Krabbe, Thouten-
hoofd, Conradi, Pijl, & Batstra, 2014) analysed the
GP records of 2,218 children between the ages of 5
and 12, of whom 85 (3.8%) had ever been prescribed
methylphenidate, the most commonly used medica-
tion for ADHD in Holland. Relatively young pupils
(born in August and September) were 143% more
likely (2.43 times as likely) to be prescribed methyl-
phenidate than their older classmates (born in
December and January). Children born in October
and
November
were
excluded
from
the
study
because parents decide when these children start
school, with many having a delayed start. The study
also reviewed the awareness of teachers and GPs of
prior studies demonstrating a late birthdate effect. A
majority of GPs (70%) and teachers (67.5%) reported
not being aware of an association between birth
month and ADHD medication use. Another small
Dutch study (Jeronimus, Stavrakakis, Veenstra, &
Oldehinkel, 2015) into relative age effects across a
range of educational and psychosocial measures
found little evidence of relative age effects; however,
this study did not investigate the relative risk of
being diagnosed or medicated for ADHD.
Other related studies
Two other studies, both very small and methodolog-
ically weak, have also investigated the relationship
between date of birth and ADHD. The earliest (Mick,
Biederman, & Faraone, 1996) was a US study of 140
Caucasian boys diagnosed with ADHD and 120 boys
without ADHD diagnoses. The study found a rela-
tionship between month of birth and probability of
being diagnosed, but suggested that there may be a
seasonal pattern of birth for some subtypes of ADHD
that may be related to seasonally mediated viral
infections.
More recently, a Canadian study (Kowalyk, Davis,
Wattie, & Baker, 2014) reviewed the distribution of
ADHD symptoms by relative age and season of birth
among adults, and found no link. It did not identify
the proportion diagnosed or medicated by month of
birth, and therefore is of little significance in deter-
mining if the ADHD any late birthdate effect carries
into adulthood from childhood.
Of greater significance is another Danish study
(Atladottir et al., 2007) that used the health records
of the 669,995 children born in Denmark from 1990
to 1999 to investigate seasonal variations in birth of
children diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disor-
ders, including 2,033 diagnosed with hyperkinetic
disorder (similar to ADHD combined type). The
authors analysed the data in order to identify if
seasonal variations ‘could suggest etiological factors
that follow a seasonal pattern’. The authors found no
‘convincing’ season of birth variations for autism-
spectrum-disorder subtypes. However, they found
‘there was some evidence of a seasonal effect for
hyperkinetic disorder, with higher rates in autumn
and lower in spring’. For seasonal analysis purposes,
December (the last month of the Danish school year
intake) was grouped with the other winter months,
January and February (the first 2 months of the
school year intake). A graph (Figure 1, p. 241) in
the paper identified a modest rising trend across the
months of the calendar year, peaking in September
then declining somewhat in November and Decem-
ber, when many redshirted children are born, before
plummeting in January. These results are consistent
with the existence of a late birthdate effect.

 Discussion
Collectively, these independent studies from 13
countries demonstrated that the youngest children
in a classroom are more likely to be diagnosed with
and medicated for ADHD than their older class-
mates, regardless of the absolute rate of diagnosis
and medication. Apart from the Danish studies,
which were inconclusive (discussed below), all stud-
ies unambiguously demonstrated a late birthdate
effect.
Our review has some limitations, primarily ema-
nating from the variety of methodologies and mea-
sures in the studies reviewed, and the fact that they
were population studies, without individual-level
data. They reported across diverse age ranges. Most
reported medication rates, but some included only
stimulants, while others included the less commonly
prescribed atomoxetine, with the proportion of chil-
dren medicated/diagnosed ranging from a high of
6.3% (aged 7–14 medicated with stimulants in the
Icelandic study; Zoega et al., 2012) to a low of 0.7%
(aged 7–19 diagnosed in the Finnish study; Sayal
et al., 2017). The Dutch study (Krabbe et al., 2014)
reported only methylphenidate use. Several also
reported diagnosis rates. One US study (Schneider
& Eisenberg, 2006) reported only a diagnosis rate.
The rates were calculated on different time bases.
Several studies compared the last month before the
cut-off date with the first month after (Chen et al.,
2016; Dalsgaard et al., 2014; Morrow et al., 2012;
Schwandt & Wuppermann, 2016; Whitely et al.,
2017). Some compared the last 3 months with the
first
3 months
(Karlstad
et al.,
2016;
Pottegard
et al.,
2014).
Four
compared
the
last
third
(4 months) with the first third (Evans et al., 2010;
Hoshen et al., 2016; Sayal et al., 2017; Zoega et al.,
2012), and two compared the first half of the year
with the second half (Elder, 2010; Librero et al.,
2015).
The different methodologies and measures used
make direct comparisons of the strength of the late
birthdate effects difficult. It seems likely that com-
parisons between the last and first month (e.g.
Australia (Whitely et al., 2017), Taiwan (Chen et al.,
2016)) will show more difference than those studies
that compare older and younger thirds (e.g. Israel
(Hoshen et al., 2016), Finland (Sayal et al., 2017)).
However, the pattern of an elevated risk of medica-
tion/diagnosis for relatively young children is com-
mon
even
in
jurisdictions
with
relatively
low
diagnosis and medication rates. For instance, the
Australian study, with a medication rate of 1.9%
reported a doubled medication use risk rate among
children aged 6–10 (youngest month compared to
oldest month; Whitely et al., 2017). On the same last
versus first month basis, the Taiwanese study (1.6%,
aged 4–17, 73% increased risk) showed similar
patterns (Chen et al., 2016). Most notably, the
Swedish study, with a reported medication rate of
0.95% (Halldner et al., 2014), and the Finnish study,
with a reported diagnosis rate of 0.7%, (Sayal et al.,
2017) both reported strong ADHD late birthdate
effects particularly among young children.
The studies conducted in Sweden (Halldner et al.,
2014), Israel (Hoshen et al., 2016), Canada (Morrow
et al., 2012), Finland (Sayal et al., 2017), Norway
(Karlstad
et al.,
2016),
Australia
(Whitely
et al.,
2017), the largest ADHD specific US study (Evans
et al., 2010) and Dalsgaard et al. (2014) Danish study
could not identify the ADHD medication and/or diag-
nosis status of children who were out of their recom-
mended school-year cohort. In studies where details
were
reported,
out-of-recommended-year
school
attendance predominantly involved delayed entry by
late-born boys. Redshirting has also been shown to be
relatively common in children diagnosed with devel-
opmental problems (West, Meek, & Hurst, 2000).
The disproportionate redshirting of late-born chil-
dren at elevated risk of being diagnosed with ADHD
may hide the full impact of late birthdate effects,
because these children are typically removed from
the late-born sample. This is likely to be more
significant in jurisdictions in which redshirting is
common (such as Israel (Hoshen et al., 2016) and
Denmark (Pottegard et al., 2014)) than in jurisdic-
tions such as Norway (Karlstad et al., 2016) and
Western Australia (Whitely et al., 2017), where there
is a high level of compliance with recommended
school year intake.
Unlike the other studies, the Danish studies
demonstrate a weak or non-existent late birthdate
effect (Atladottir et al., 2007; Dalsgaard et al., 2014;
Pottegard et al., 2014). In Denmark, the majority of
late-born boys were redshirted. As suggested by
Pottegard et al. (2014) allowing parents to redshirt
children they consider too young for school may
reduce or remove any late birthdate effect. However,
there are dangers in simply assuming that redshirting
leads to desirable outcomes such as eliminating
relative age effects. As discussed above, redshirting
may hide the full impact of the late birthdate effect. It
is also possible that the greater age spread associated
with increased flexibility may increase the potential
for age related immaturity to influence educational
and other life outcomes in other children. There could
even be contradictory effects whereby redshirted
children achieve better academic and social outcomes
and reduced rates of ADHD than they would have if
they began school ‘on time’, but other children suffer
stronger relative age effects from having older children
in their class. Further research into the effects of
redshirting on the ADHD late birthdate and other
relative age effects is warranted.
Despite the limitations described above, the main
finding of this study is clear. School entry cut-off
dates, even when they occur mid-season, delineate
significant changes in medication and/or diagnosis
rates. This finding does not support the season of
birth hypothesis suggested by Atladottir et al. (2007)

 and Mick et al. (1996). With the exception of the
German (Schwandt & Wuppermann, 2016) and
Norwegian studies (Karlstad et al., 2016) the late
birthdate effect was stronger in early years of school.
This is most likely a reflection of the age difference
being greater in relative terms in younger children
than older children resulting in more pronounced
age-related immaturity.
The reasons for the German (Schwandt & Wupper-
mann, 2016) and Norwegian (Karlstad et al., 2016)
studies showing a different trend, with older ages
showing a stronger late birthdate effect, are unclear. It
may be related to academic testing and ranking of
performance, which first occurs in these countries at
ages 9–10. Relative age-related poor academic perfor-
mance at these ages may be mistakenly attributed to
undiagnosed ADHD. It could be that age-related
behavioural immaturity is the primary driver in other
jurisdictions, but age-related academic disadvantage
is a more significant driver of the ADHD late birthdate
effect in Germany and Norway.
An interesting feature of the majority of studies
that reported gender specific late birthdate effects
(Canada (Morrow et al., 2012), Norway (Karlstad
et al., 2016), Finland (Sayal et al., 2017) and Aus-
tralia (Whitely et al., 2017)) is that the effect was
stronger for girls than boys, although in all studies
boys were many times more likely to be diagnosed
and medicated than girls. It is puzzling that girls,
with a much lower diagnosis and medication rate
than boys, show a stronger late birthdate effect.
Further
investigation
is
required
to
establish
whether this is a consistent pattern and if so, why
it is occurring.
It has long been debated whether ADHD is caused
by neurobiological malfunction. Research led by
Shaw found that children with ADHD tend to have
cortical development that ‘lagged behind that of
typically developing children by several years’ and
that treatment with psychostimulants is a ‘possible
but unlikely’ cause (Shaw et al., 2007). The tempo-
rary nature of the delay, the possibility (however
remote) of stimulant induced brain atrophy, and the
late birthdate effect demonstrated in multiple stud-
ies, suggest that, rather than being diagnosed and
medicated, impulsive and/or inattentive children
should be supported through the extra time they
need to mature. This is particularly the case for
young-for-grade
children
who
may
seem
more
hyperactive and/or inattentive than their peers,
but in reality are acting in an age appropriate
manner and their age related immaturity needs to
be accommodated.
The diagnostic criteria of ADHD – in particular
making careless mistakes, not ‘seeming to’ listen,
failing to finish school work, being disorganised,
disliking schoolwork or homework, blurting out
answers and leaving a seat when remaining seated
is expected – are all evidence of a child’s failure to
comply
in
a
school
environment.
Teachers
are
usually asked to complete a check list of ADHD
behavioural diagnostic criteria for a child suspected
of having ADHD. The authors of several studies have
proposed that the most likely mechanism driving the
late birthdate effect is some teachers rating the
behaviour of the youngest children in their class
against classroom norms without due regard to their
birthdate, resulting in higher rates of diagnosis and
subsequent medication than are warranted.
Ultimately
clinicians,
not
teachers,
diagnose
ADHD. However, a 2003 US study found ‘that in
the majority of cases teachers are the first to suggest
a diagnosis of ADHD’ (Sax & Kautz, 2003). Even
when teachers are not the first to suggest a diagno-
sis, the information they provide to clinicians still
often plays a central role in the process. Ideally both
clinicians and teachers should be cognisant of the
potential for relative age to affect the external
presentation of ADHD diagnostic criteria.
Two studies investigated the relationship between
month of birth and parent-reported ADHD symp-
toms.
Both
found no
association
(Elder,
2010;
Halldner et al., 2014). Parents may compare the
behaviour of their child to siblings, relatives or
friends; but, unlike teachers, they are unlikely to
regularly compare the behaviour of relatively young-
for-class children to older classmates. Parents are
therefore less likely to mistakenly identify relative
age related immaturity as the symptoms of ADHD.
This highlights the importance of clinicians being
aware of the potential for a late birthdate effect in
teacher ratings and, as is recommended in DSM5,
considering the child’s behaviour in both home and
school settings.
Teachers and clinicians failing to take appropriate
account of relative age is one of many non-biological
factors that have been associated with higher rates of
ADHD diagnosis and medication use. Gender, ethnic-
ity of students and teachers (Schneider & Eisenberg,
2006), divorce (Hjern, Weitoft, & Lindblad, 2010),
poverty (Russell, Ford, Rosenberg, & Kelly, 2014),
parenting styles (Johnston, Mash, Miller, & Ninowski,
2012), low maternal education, lone parenthood and
the receipt of social welfare (Hjern et al., 2010), sexual
abuse (Weinstein, Staffelbach, & Biaggio, 2000), sleep
deprivation (Thakkar, 2013), perinatal issues (Schmitt
& Romanos, 2012), artificial food additives (McCann
et al., 2007), mobile phone use (Byun et al., 2013),
clinician speciality (Parliament, Legislative Assembly,
2004), geography and regulatory capture (Whitely,
2014), have all been associated with an increased risk
of an ADHD diagnosis.
Allen Frances, the prominent US psychiatrist who
led the American Psychiatric Association’s Task
Force on DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association,
2005), has cited studies from the USA (Evans et al.,
2010), Canada (Morrow et al., 2012), Taiwan (Chen
et al., 2016), and Iceland (Zoega et al., 2012), as
providing ‘conclusive proof’ ADHD is over-diagnosed
(Frances,
2016/2017).

 critical of US prescribing rates and has argued that a
diagnostic rate of around 2%–3% would best balance
harms and benefits (Frances, 2015).
Schwandt and Wuppermann’s analysis appears to
support Frances’ position. They found a strong linear
relationship between the strength of the late birth-
date effect and ADHD rates in cross-national and
German state jurisdictions:
Cross-country variation in cut-off jumps [the late
birthdate effect] is highly predictive of a country’s
average ADHD level and that this positive relation-
ship is remarkably linear. Moreover, it is very
similar to the relationship observed across German
states. In other words, countries and regions with
strong jumps in ADHD rates around age cut-offs
have also higher overall ADHD rates, perhaps
because cut-off jumps proxy for a general tendency
to mis- and over-diagnose ADHD.(Schwandt &
Wuppermann, 2016)
This assertion was based on interstate (within
Germany) comparisons, and international data from
Danish (Dalsgaard et al., 2014) Canadian (Morrow
et al., 2012) USA (Elder, 2010) and Icelandic (Zoega
et al., 2012) studies. However, the data from the
large Swedish (Halldner et al., 2014), Finnish (Sayal
et al., 2017), Taiwanese (Chen et al., 2016), Aus-
tralian (Whitely et al., 2017), studies and the much
smaller Spanish study (Librero et al., 2015), which
all show strong late birthdate effects at relatively low
rates of prescribing, were not included. Although
most of these five studies were published after
Schwandt and Wuppermann wrote their paper, it is
puzzling that they cited the Swedish study, which
includes detailed data on the number of children
using medication for a total population of over 1.8
million children (Halldner et al., 2014), but did not
include it in their ‘cross-country’ analysis (Schwandt
& Wuppermann, 2016).
The five studies from jurisdictions with reported
diagnosis/medication rates in line with, or lower
than Frances’ estimated ideal target range, are
inconsistent with the ‘positive. . . remarkably linear’
relationship noted in (Schwandt and Wuppermann
(2016) study.
Conclusions
It is unclear whether allowing parents to have
greater
discretion
in
deciding
when
their
child
begins school alleviates or disguises the ADHD late
birthdate effect. Further research on this issue is
warranted. However, it is clear that it is the norm
internationally for the youngest children in a class-
room to be at increased risk of being diagnosed with
and medicated for ADHD, even in jurisdictions with
relatively low prescribing rates. This evidence chal-
lenges the notion that low rates indicate sound
diagnostic practices. Teachers and clinicians need
to be aware of the potential for relative age related
immaturity
to
be
misdiagnosed
as
ADHD
and
adjust
their
teaching
and
diagnostic
practices
accordingly.

Key points
What is already known:
� The oldest children in age-based educational or sporting cohorts tend to outperform their younger peers.
� Some studies have found that the youngest children in a classroom are more likely to be diagnosed with or
medicated for ADHD than their older classmates.
What this study adds:
� It establishes that it is usual for the youngest children in a classroom to be at a significantly increased risk
of being medicated for ADHD, even in jurisdictions with relatively low diagnosis/prescribing rates.
� Academic ‘redshirting’ (allowing parental discretion to delay school entry) is associated with a weaker
demonstrated late birthdate effect; however, it is unclear whether this prevents and/or disguises the effect.
