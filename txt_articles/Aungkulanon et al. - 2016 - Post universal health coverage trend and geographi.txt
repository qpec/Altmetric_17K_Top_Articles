Abstract
Background: Thailand has achieved remarkable improvement in health status since the achievement of universal
health coverage in 2002. Health equity has improved significantly. However, challenges on health inequity still
remain.This study aimed to determine the trends of geographical inequalities in disease specific mortality in
Thailand after the country achieved universal health coverage.
Methods: National vital registration data from 2001 to 2014 were used to calculate age-adjusted mortality rate and
standardized mortality ratio (SMR). To minimize large variations in mortality across administrative districts, the
adjacent districts were systematically grouped into “super-districts” by taking into account the population size and
proximity. Geographical mortality inequality among super-districts was measured by the coefficient of variation.
Mixed effects modeling was used to test the difference in trends between super-districts.
Results: The overall SMR steadily declined from 1.2 in 2001 to 0.9 in 2014. The upper north and upper northeast
regions had higher SMR whereas Greater Bangkok achieved the lowest SMR. Decreases in SMR were mostly seen in
Greater Bangkok and the upper northern region. Coefficient of variation of SMR rapidly decreased from 20.0 in 2001
to 12.5 in 2007 and remained close to this value until 2014. The mixed effects modelling revealed significant
differences in trends of SMR across super-districts. Inequality in mortality declined among adults (≥15 years old)
but increased in children (0–14 years old). A declining trend in inequality of mortality was seen in almost all
regions except Greater Bangkok where the inequality in SMR remained high throughout the study period.
Conclusions: A decline in the adult mortality inequality across almost all regions of Thailand followed universal
health coverage. Inequalities in child mortality rates and among residents of Greater Bangkok need further
exploration.

Background
Tackling health inequity is high on the current global
and national agenda [1]. Equity is the cornerstone of the
Sustainable development goals (SDGs,) entailing “leaving
no one behind”. The overall SDGs call for healthy life
for all ages, has positioning equity as a core, cross-
cutting theme [2]. SDG 10 calls for actions to reduce in-
equality within and among countries, and Target 3.8
calls for the establishment of the universal health cover-
age (UHC) as a key instrument to achieve health goal
with an equitable outcome. Thus, monitoring changes in
disparities of health status, use of health services, and
healthcare expenditure is essential for identifying gaps,
and understanding which groups are being left behind,
in order to implement effective interventions [3].
Since the achievement of UHC in Thailand in 2002, sev-
eral evaluations have reported substantial improvement in
the health status [4, 5], overall use of health services [6, 7],
preventive activities [8], and reduction in catastrophic
health expenditure and medical impoverishment [9, 10].

 To our knowledge, there is only one study from
Japan reporting the long-term impact of UHC on
mortality; however, without assessment across geo-
graphical areas [11].
A recent study noted a continued decline in mortality
rates in Thailand [12]. However, national average obscures
intra-national differences and inequalities. Previous studies
have noted significant regional variations in health outcome
such as prevalence of chronic diseases [13–15], and their
risk factors such as obesity [16] and hypertension [17]. Two
pre-UHC studies reported sharp variations in all-cause and
cause-specific mortality rates across geography but both
studies were assessed before achievement of UHC [18, 19].
Whether the level of these health inequalities has been re-
duced following UHC has not been well documented. To
fill the knowledge gap, we assessed the 14-year trend of
geographical inequalities in mortality within different areas
using vital registration data and tested the null hypothesis
of different trends across these areas.
Methods
Data sources
Individual mortality data from all causes for years 2001
through 2014 were obtained from the national vital regis-
tration database, Ministry of Interior where cause of death
was coded using the International Classification of Dis-
eases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) by the Bureau of Policy
and Strategy, Ministry of Public Health. The 12 common
deaths based on category of World Health Organization’s
Mortality Tabulation list including tuberculosis (ICD10
codes A15-A19, B90), HIV/AIDS (B20-B24), liver cancer
(C22), lung cancer (C33-C34), diabetes (E10-E14), ische-
mic heart disease (IHD) (I20-I25), stroke (I60-I69),
pneumonia (J12-J18), chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease (COPD) (J40-44), asthma (J45), cirrhosis (K74), and
traffic injuries (V01-V04, V06, V09-V80, V87, V89, V99)
were chosen. Mortality was credited to each district ac-
cording to the individual’s registered place of residence.
Mid-year population data of each districts for the period
2001-2014 was obtained from the Bureau of Registration
Administration, Ministry of Interior.
Age- and sex-adjusted mortality rate and standardized
mortality ratio (SMR) were calculated to measure mortality
across time and population. The average Thai population
age and sex structure during 2001-2014 was used as the
standard population and further used as a weighting factor
to calculate age- and sex-adjusted mortality rate. Geo-
graphic inequality in SMR across different areas and age
groups was measured by the coefficient of variation (CV)
at each year. Piecewise regression analysis was used to
identify the time point of changing in trend.
Thailand was a lower middle-income country with a
population of around 66 million during the study period.
The country is divided into 77 provinces and 928
administrative districts. The population of these districts
varies substantially, ranging from a minimum of 2411 to
a maximum 521,651. To reduce the problem of differ-
ence in denominator, we regrouped the districts to show
stable rates in areas with sparse population. Based on 2014
population, small districts within each province was merged
with larger and adjacent districts (or groups of already
merged districts) and the resulting areas were called
“super-district”. The definition of a super-district is a dis-
trict or group of districts that contains a minimum popula-
tion of 100,000 persons. We applied the method outlined
in Babcock’s study to group districts into super-districts
[20]. As the population in the districts and number of ad-
ministrative districts also changed over the 14-year study
period. The district population sizes in 2014 were used to
construct the super-districts. Before merging, the mean
(standard deviation) population of all districts was of
68,644 (55,233). After merging, a total of 331 super-districts
out of the total 928 administrative districts were formed
with population ranging from 100,849 to 521,651, and a
mean (standard deviation) of 195,524 (73,805). Our prelim-
inary analysis revealed that the distribution of all-cause
SMRs at the super-district level was normal. Parametric
statistics were therefore used throughout the analysis.
Mixed effects modeling was used to test whether trends
(slope) of SMR across super-districts were equal. All data
analysis was undertaken and graphical displays created
using SAS software version 9.4.
Results
A total of 5,539,154 deaths were reported in the death
registration database during the 14-year study period.
The all cause age-adjusted mortality rate decreased from
672.12 per 100,000 population in 2001 to 574.94 in
2014, with an average annual decline of 6.07 per 100,000
(95% CI: 3.15–8.99).
Figure 1 presents the geographical distribution of average
annual SMR during 2001–2014 across super-districts of
Thailand. Clustering of high SMR was largely confined to
certain areas of the northern and upper northeast regions
whereas in Greater Bangkok (Bangkok, Prathumtani,
Nonthaburi, Samutprakan, Samutsakhon, Nakornprathom
provinces), and the southern region was relatively low.
Figure 2 shows the geographical distribution of age spe-
cific mortality rates for various age groups. Child mortality
was obviously high along Myanmar and Malaysia borders.
Figure 3 displays trend of SMR for each super-district
demonstrated by spaghetti plot; the median SMR is plotted
as a black line and CV shown in red. The CV decreased
rapidly during the first half of the study period (from 20.0
in 2001 to 12.5 in2007) but remained relatively constant in
recent years (2008–2014). Piecewise linear regression con-
firmed this visual impression with a slope of -1.31 unit per
year between 2001 and 2007 and increased by only 0.09 per

 year between 2008 and 2014. Furthermore, mixed effects
modeling with year as fixed effects revealed that slops of
the super-districts were not equal but should be treated as
significant random variables (p < .0001). This indicated dif-
ferent trends of mortality rates.
Figure 4, Panel A shows that the mortality rates de-
creased in all age groups except 65+, where it went up
and then down in a curvy way. In Panel B, the CV
declined in age groups 15–44 and 65+ years while in-
creased in age group 0–4 years. Figure 5 shows that mor-
tality rates declined steadily and most sharply in Greater
Bangkok and the upper northern region. The initial high
SMR in 2001 in the upper northern region had steadily
declined to the average national level among other re-
gions, where their SMRs were relatively stable since the
beginning of the study period. In Fig. 5b, there was a

 declining trend of mortality inequality in all regions except
Greater Bangkok. The upper southern part had the high-
est reduction of mortality variation (65.93% reduction in
CV for SMR), followed by west (60.54%), lower northeast
(57.11%), lower north (50.20%), and upper north (47.71%).
The geographical distributions of cause-specific mortality
for the 12 selected causes of death are shown in Fig. 6. The
northern region had higher rate of death from HIV/AIDS,
COPD, lung cancer, and asthma compared to the other
regions. The upper northeast region had relatively high
rates of death from liver cancer and diabetes. Compared
with the upper northeast, the lower northeast had lower
mortalities from liver cancer, diabetes, and others except
tuberculosis. The southern part had relatively low mortality
from most diseases except asthma and traffic injuries.
Deaths from stroke, IHD, tuberculosis and pneumonia were
geographically homogeneous though the rates were
relatively higher in the central region. For traffic injur-
ies, super-districts having high SMR seem to be spread
throughout most region, except the northeast. Similar
to all-cause mortality, the distribution patterns for each
of 12 selected conditions were clustered.

 Figure 7 show trends of mortality rates of six (out of 12)
selected disease groups. Both lung and liver cancer mortal-
ities showed an increasing trend in all regions. COPD and
diabetic mortality rates remain relatively stable in most re-
gions whereas stroke showed a long term upward mortality
trend. Trends of HIV mortality declined, particularly in the
upper north region. Figure 8 displays trends in inequality of
cause-specific mortality by region. The inequalities of most
diseases mortalities have either declining or stable trends in
all regions except diabetes and HIV/AID mortalities in
Greater Bangkok had increasing inequality trends.
Discussion
The overall mortality in Thailand have steadily declined
since universal health coverage was achieved in 2002.
Geographical inequalities in mortality rapidly decreased
in the first half of the study period and has since become
stable. A decline in the inequality gaps was seen in adults
but gaps remained high among children. The reduction in
mortality was mostly seen in Greater Bangkok, a low mor-
tality region, and the upper north, a region with high mor-
tality. Most regions had a declining trend in mortality
inequality, while in Greater Bangkok, though the rate was

 low, the inequality remained high. Variation in mortality
rates with regional and sub-regional clustering was ob-
served for several causes of death. For example, a high
mortality rate of liver cancer and diabetes was seen in the
upper northeast. COPD and lung cancer were high in the
upper northern region. Inequalities for most chronic dis-
eases have declined or stabilized in all regions except for
diabetes and HIV/AID which both had increasing trends
in Greater Bangkok.
A steady decline in mortality rates have been docu-
mented worldwide [12, 21–24]. A combination of many
factors including economic growth, poverty reduction,
and a variety of contributing factors such as literacy rates,
particular among females, and education level have had a
positive influence on these health achievements in the past
few decades. Better nutrition and sanitation are also major
contributing factors. Our study showed that disparity in
mortality reduced rapidly between 2001 and 2007 and sta-
bilized in subsequent years. This declining inequality trend
of overall mortality was mostly influenced by the reduc-
tion inequality of HIV mortality in person aged 15–44
years in the north region of Thailand. Deaths from HIV
was the number one ranked cause of death among the
adults [25] and was concentrated more in the northern
region where is known to be the epicenter of the HIV epi-
demic in Thailand [26, 27]. Reduction in HIV mortality in
this working age group followed the successful HIV pre-
vention program (in particular vertical prevention from
mother to child) and high coverage of universal access to
antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV may explain all
these trends [28, 29] The UHC extended the insured
population from about twenty-five million (40% of the
population) in 2001 to above fifty-nine million (95.5%) in
2004 [30]. The reduction in inequality documented here
was partly due to the improvement in the benefits package
and full population coverage under the universal health-
care policy.
The recent stagnant reduction in health inequality
highlights the needs for greater efforts on further re-
duction. Inequality in child mortality has been high and
sustained throughout the study period. High mortality
of children aged under-five years in areas close to
Myanmar (where there are a large number of ethnic
minority groups, stateless people and hard to reach
mountainous areas) and Malaysia (in particular among
the Muslim communities) highlights a real challenge to
improve access to health services among children in
these sub-regions. Although universal access to maternal
and child health services is well founded in Thailand [31],
our results indicate the need to emphasize better care in
the marginalized communities [32, 33]. The overall
mortality rate has been falling in most regions. The lar-
gest reductions have been observed in Greater Bangkok
and the north. The huge decline in Greater Bangkok
could be due to rapid improvements in the standard of
living due to economic prosperity. The case of sharp re-
duction in the north has already been described above.
However, the consistently high level of inequality, and
low mortality in Greater Bangkok suggests a need for
further investigation.
Our findings of geographical clustering of all-cause
mortality and cause-specific mortality are consistent
with those of previously published papers that examined
geographical variation of mortality in Thailand using
national vital registration data for the 2000 period [18, 19].
High overall mortality was observed in the northeastern
and northern regions. This is probably due to higher
poverty levels in these two regions [34]. Health work-
force density was found to be poorer than other afflu-
ent areas such as Bangkok Metropolis [35–37].
Clustering of high mortality from liver cancer in the
upper northeast can be explained mainly by the ex-
tremely high prevalence of chronic liver fluke infestation,
the major risk factor of cholangiocarcinoma [38]. The
local community habit of eating uncooked cyprinoid fish
infested with Opisthorchis viverrini results in high preva-
lence of cholangiocarcinoma in northeastern Thailand
[39]. Clustering of high lung cancer, COPD, and asthma
mortality in the north may reflect ambient air pollution.
However, slightly high mortality from asthma in the
southern region needs further investigations. Although
the southern region has the highest smoking rate in the
country [40], smoking alone cannot fully explain the
clustering of respiratory deaths. Variation in deaths for
stroke and IHD by region were also evident, with the
greatest rates found in the lower northern, central, and
eastern regions which are the industrial zones. Areas
with low cardiovascular mortality tended to be in the
northeast region. The high mortality of diabetes mellitus
is another major public health problem in the northeast-
ern region. Many studies found that the prevalence of
diabetes was higher in urban than in rural areas [41, 42].
The higher rates of mortality for diabetes in the north-
east, where the majority of the population reside in rural
areas highlight the need for subnational assessment for
associated risk factor, and quality of health care.
Districts with sparse populations were combined into
super-districts to prevent the creation of unstable mortality
rates. However, super-district is an areal unit, delineated by
larger administrative district boundaries rather than natural
features or cohesive groups and as such is subject to the
Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) [43].
Despite the fact that up to 98% of total deaths are cer-
tified, the quality of mortality statistics was considered
poor because a large proportion of registered death are
classified as being due to ill-defined conditions [44, 45].
One reason for the poor quality of recorded causes of
death was that about 60% of the deaths occurred outside
Aungkulanon et al. International Journal for Equity in Health  (2016) 15:190

 hospitals and thus were recorded and coded by nonmedical
personnel. While this issue may have a potential influence
on cause-specific mortality rates, it may have little influ-
ence on the overall trends.
Although it is clear that Thailand’s UHC was followed
by a sharp reduction in mortality inequality, this cross-
sectional study cannot elucidate causality. There are
several possible determinants of mortality inequality includ-
ing demographic, socio-economic, geographic, and health
system variables that were not included in this analysis,
thus the ability to explain this inequality is limited.
Conclusions
In conclusion, during the 14 years of UHC scheme in
Thailand, a steady decline of mortality was observed
with varying degrees of reduction in inequality across
age groups, diseases and geographical areas. Persistent
disparities in mortality outcomes in children and in the
capital city are still a concern. More effort is needed to
further reduce these inequalities. Findings from regular
monitoring of mortality inequality can contribute to spe-
cific policy interventions.
