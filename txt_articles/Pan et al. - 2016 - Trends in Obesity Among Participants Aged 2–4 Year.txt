Childhood obesity is associated with negative health con-
sequences in childhood (1) that continue into adulthood (2), 
putting adults at risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, 
and certain cancers (1). Obesity disproportionately affects chil-
dren from low-income families (3). Through a collaboration 
with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), 
CDC has begun to use data from the Special Supplemental 
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) 
Participants and Program Characteristics (WIC PC) to replace 
the Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System (PedNSS) (4,5) for 
obesity surveillance among young children from low-income 
families. CDC examined trends in obesity prevalence during 
2000–2014 among WIC participants aged 2–4 years using 
WIC PC data. Overall obesity prevalence increased from 
14.0% in 2000 to 15.5% in 2004 and 15.9% in 2010, and then 
decreased to 14.5% in 2014. During 2010–2014, the preva-
lence of obesity decreased significantly overall, among non-
Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, American 
Indian/Alaska Natives and Asians/Pacific Islanders, and among 
34 (61%) of the 56 WIC state agencies in states, the District 
of Columbia, and U.S. territories. Despite these declines, the 
obesity prevalence among children aged 2–4 years in WIC 
remains high compared with the national prevalence of 8.9% 
among children aged 2–5 years in 2011–2014. Continued 
initiatives to work with parents and other stakeholders to 
promote healthy pregnancies, breastfeeding, quality nutrition, 
and physical activity for young children in multiple settings 
are needed to ensure healthy child development.
To improve maternal and child health among women and 
children at risk for poor nutrition, WIC provides supple-
mental foods, nutrition education, and health care referral 
for low-income women who are pregnant, postpartum, or 
breastfeeding, and infants and children aged up to 5 years. 
WIC is administered in each state or territory by state health 
departments or Indian tribal organizations. WIC PC is a bien-
nial census conducted by the USDA in even years that includes 
participants certified to receive WIC benefits in April of the 
reporting year. To be eligible for WIC, women, infants, and 
children have to meet residential, income (gross household 
income ≤185% of the U.S. Poverty Level or adjunctively eli-
gible for other child nutrition programs), and nutrition risk 
requirements.* Children’s weight and height were measured by 
clinic-trained staff members according to a standard protocol†; 
children’s weight and height records during the most recent 
certification or recertification were included. Obesity was 
defined as sex-specific body mass index (BMI)-for-age ≥95th 
percentile on the 2000 CDC growth charts.
JoinPoint regression was used to identify the inflection years 
when changes in the overall trend occurred. Log binomial 
regression adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity was used 
to estimate prevalence ratios that represent relative changes 
in prevalence between two inflection years. Differences in 
adjusted prevalence were then calculated ([prevalence at begin-
ning of period] x [adjusted prevalence ratio] – [prevalence at 
beginning of period]). Changes in obesity prevalence were con-
sidered statistically significant if the 95% confidence intervals 
for differences in adjusted prevalence did not include zero.
Data from the WIC state agencies in 50 states, the District of 
Columbia, and five U.S. territories are included in the analyses. 
Approximately 90% of participants lived in households with 
gross incomes ≤185% of the U.S. Poverty Level. Approximately 
75% of the anthropometric data were collected within 6 months 
before April of the reporting year. Data on 24,472 (0.11%) 
children from Hawaii in 2002 and 2004 were excluded because 
these prevalence estimates differed by >10 percentage points 
from the values predicted by a robust regression model, as 
were children whose weight and height were measured >1 year 
before the reporting year (n = 1,062 [0.005%]) or whose sex, 
weight, height, or BMI were missing or biologically implausible 
(194,526 [0.85%]) (6). The final analytic sample included 
22,553,518 children aged 2–4 years from 56 WIC state agencies.
During 2000–2010, overall obesity prevalence increased 
significantly from 14.0% (2000) to 15.5% (2004) and 15.9% 
(2010); during 2010–2014, obesity prevalence decreased sig-
nificantly to 14.5% (2014) (Figure) (Table). In a sensitivity 
analysis to assess the impact on the effect from Hawaii and the 
Northern Mariana Islands, which did not have consistent, reli-
able data during 2000–2014, the overall prevalence remained 
the same during 2000, 2004, and 2010 and increased slightly

from 14.5% to 14.6% in 2014, when data from Hawaii and 
the Northern Mariana Islands were excluded. Patterns in overall 
obesity trends remained the same.
Obesity prevalence in all years was highest among American 
Indians/Alaska Natives and Hispanics. Among non-Hispanic 
whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and American 
Indians/Alaska Natives, prevalence increased significantly 
during 2000–2004, then decreased significantly during 2010–
2014. Among Asians/Pacific Islanders, prevalence decreased 
significantly throughout the study period (Figure). Patterns in 
obesity trends remained the same for all racial/ethnic groups 
if Hawaii and the Northern Mariana Islands were excluded.
The JoinPoint analysis identified 2004 and 2010 as the inflec-
tion years for overall obesity trend. Obesity prevalences by WIC 
state agency are observed at four time points (2000, 2004, 2010, 
and 2014), with comparisons in adjusted prevalence during 2004 
and 2000, 2010 and 2004, and 2014 and 2010 (Table). Among 
the 54 state agencies with data for 2000 and 2004, an increase in 
obesity prevalence was observed in 48 (89%); among these, 38 
(70%) were statistically significant; the largest increase occurred in 
Kansas (from 11.8% to 16.7%). Obesity prevalence decreased for 
four (7%) WIC state agencies; Puerto Rico was the only WIC state 
agency with a significant decrease (from 22.1% to 21.3%) (Table).
Among the 54 WIC state agen_cies with data for 2004 and 
2010, an increase in prevalence occurred in 26 (48%), including 
17 (31%) that were statistically significant; a decrease occurred 
in 27 (50%) WIC state agencies, including 20 (37%) that were 
statistically significant. The largest increase in obesity prevalence 
occurred in New Mexico (from 11.0% to 15.7%) and the largest 
decrease occurred in Illinois (from 20.3% to 15.7%) (Table).
Among the 56 WIC state agencies with data for 2010 and 
2014, only nine (16%) experienced an increase in obesity 
prevalence, including four (7%) in which the increase was 
statistically significant. The largest significant increase occurred 
in Nebraska (from 14.4% to 16.9%). In contrast, a decrease in 
obesity prevalence occurred in 45 (80%) WIC state agencies, 
including 34 (61%) in which the difference was statistically 
significant. The adjusted prevalence decreased by more than 
3 percentage points in six WIC state agencies; the largest sig-
nificant decrease was in Puerto Rico (from 20.3% to 13.9%).

Discussion
The prevalence of obesity among young children from 
low-income families participating in WIC in U.S. states and 
territories was 14.5% in 2014. This estimate was higher than 
the national estimate (8.9%) among all U.S. children in a 
slightly different age group (2–5 years) based on data from 
the 2011–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (7). Since 2010, statistically significant downward 
trends in obesity prevalence among WIC young children have 
been observed overall, in all five racial/ethnic groups, and in 
34 of the 56 WIC state agencies, suggesting that prevention 
initiatives are making progress, potentially by impacting the 
estimated excess of calories eaten versus energy expended for 
this vulnerable group (8).
Nutrition during pregnancy and early childhood is critical 
for healthy child growth and development. A recent review 
of factors contributing to childhood obesity identified risk 
factors present during pregnancy and the first 2 years of life, 
including high maternal prepregnancy BMI, excess maternal 
gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes, high infant 
birth weight, and rapid infant weight gain that can influence 
the risk for obesity in later childhood (9). The USDA WIC 
program reaches low-income mothers and children with 
nutritional risk during this critical developmental period. 
WIC promotes healthy eating and provides nutrition educa-
tion that emphasizes the nutritional needs of women who are 
pregnant, postpartum, or breastfeeding, and children aged 
up to 5 years. In 2009, the WIC food packages were revised§ 
to align with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the 
infant feeding practice guidelines of the American Academy of 
Pediatrics. The revisions promote and support breastfeeding, 
provide WIC participants with a wider variety of healthy food 
options, and improve availability of and access to healthy foods 
in communities (10).

Other factors also might be contributing to the modest 
declines in obesity among WIC young children. Local, state, 
and national obesity initiatives and reports such as Let’s Move,¶ 
the White House Childhood Obesity Task Force report,** 
and the Institute of Medicine recommendations†† have raised 
awareness and drawn the attention of stakeholders, including 
parents, early care and education (ECE) providers, commu-
nity and business leaders, industry, health care providers, and 
public health officials. A number of federal initiatives have 
provided support to states and localities to assist ECE programs 
to improve nutrition, breastfeeding support, physical activ-
ity, and screen time standards. For example, CDC supports 
states in embedding these standards in their ECE systems

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. 
First, findings might not be generalizable to all young children 
from low-income families, because the study includes only young 
children who participated in WIC and only about 50% of WIC 
eligible young children were enrolled in the program.¶¶ Second, 
findings of this study are not directly comparable to those based 
on the older PedNSS data, which also included WIC participants 
(4,5). Data collected by PedNSS in January–December calendar 
years included participants from some other child nutrition pro-
grams (<20%), in addition to WIC, but did not have consistent 
data for all WIC state agencies over time.

Despite the recent declining trends, the obesity prevalence for 
young, low-income children in WIC remains high at 14.5% in 
2014. To reduce the high prevalence of early childhood obesity 
among low-income families, new and continued implementa-
tion of evidence-based measures are needed to support and 
educate pregnant women, ensure parents and families have 
the appropriate information about healthy behaviors, and 
encourage stakeholders across various settings and sectors to 
create supportive nutrition and physical activity environments.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Previous analyses using Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System 
(PedNSS) data found that during 2008–2011, obesity prevalence 
among children aged 2–4 years who participated in the Special 
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and 
Children (WIC) and other nutrition and health programs 
declined slightly overall, among non-Hispanic whites, non-
Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and Asians/Pacific Islanders, and in 
19 of 43 states and U.S. territories.
What is added by this report?
The WIC Participants and Program Characteristics (WIC PC) 
census data replaces the PedNSS system to report obesity 
prevalence among low-income young children from more 
jurisdictions consistently. This is the first study to use WIC PC 
data to examine early childhood obesity among low-income 
WIC young children. Modest declines in obesity prevalence 
from 2010 to 2014 were observed overall and in all five racial/
ethnic groups. Among the 56 WIC state agencies in states, the 
District of Columbia, and U.S. territories, 34 had statistically 
significant declines. Despite the recent downward trends, the 
overall obesity prevalence among WIC children aged 2–4 years 
remains high at 14.5% in 2014.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Continued obesity prevention initiatives at the national, state, and 
local levels are needed. Policy and practice changes in key settings 
(community, early care and education, and health care), and 
initiatives that support pregnant women, parents, and key care 
providers to promote healthy pregnancies, breastfeeding, quality 
nutrition, and physical activity for young children are needed to 
further reduce the prevalence of early childhood obesity.
