Microbiome and mental health in the
modern environment
Emily Deans1,2
Abstract
A revolution in the understanding of the pathophysiology of mental illness combined with new knowledge about
host/microbiome interactions and psychoneuroimmunology has opened an entirely new field of study, the
“psychobiotics”. The modern microbiome is quite changed compared to our ancestral one due to diet, antibiotic
exposure, and other environmental factors, and these differences may well impact our brain health. The sheer
complexity and scope of how diet, probiotics, prebiotics, and intertwined environmental variables could influence
mental health are profound obstacles to an organized and useful study of the microbiome and psychiatric disease.
However, the potential for positive anti-inflammatory effects and symptom amelioration with perhaps few side
effects makes the goal of clarifying the role of the microbiota in mental health a vital one.
Keywords: Microbiome, Psychobiotics, Mental health
Main text
Mental health problems such as affective disorders, anx-
iety disorders, and psychotic disorders are not just dis-
eases caused by psychological stressors added to genetic
vulnerability, but rather full-body, inflammatory condi-
tions related to the immune state [1–4]. In this light, the
role of the microbiome, 100 trillion or so organisms that
provide a barrier and a profound effect on our immune
regulatory function, most notably in the large intestine
[5], becomes immensely important. The state of our
microbiome affects not only diseases of the gut but also
autoimmune disease, obesity [6, 7], and even how well
the liver metabolizes alcohol [8]. While every person’s
microbiome is unique, generally healthy people share
certain species, diversity, and abundance. It is clear that
the microbiomes of humans living in the developed
world are far different from those of hunter-gatherers
living more as our ancestors did [9]. Are these observed
differences in microbiota a surrogate marker for modern
pressures exerted on humans? The available evidence
would suggest that microbiota and mental health be
viewed through the lens of physiological anthropology in
the context of evolutionary medicine. Researchers have
taken these findings to explore the impact of the micro-
biome on mental health [10].
The gut-brain connection hinges on how the micro-
biome influences the hypothalamic-adrenal-pituitary axis
in a similar way to psychological stress, with pathogenic
species of bacteria interacting with the immune and
endocrine systems to create an inflammatory cascade
with an increase in sympathetic reactivity [11]. These in-
flammatory species also have direct communication with
the brain via self-produced neurotransmitters and the
vagus nerve receptors in the gut, with mostly unknown
significance [12, 13]. Probiotics or anti-inflammatory
species, the most studied being the Lactobacillus and
Bifidobacteria, can act to suppress this immune and
sympathetic reaction. Demonstrations in both animal
and human studies have shown that the administration
of beneficial microbes can reduce both inflammation
and anxiety or behavioral signs of distress [14–16].
These agents work on the same system but in a different
location as chemical antidepressants, suggesting possibil-
ities for a new “psychobiotic” class of low-side effect
anti-inflammatory, anti-anxiety, and antidepressant.
The studies thus far are promising though small in
scale and broad in scope. Rodent behavior [17] and
levels of anxiety are influenced by probiotics, prebiotics
(types of fiber that act as food for the microbiome), and
fecal transplants [18]. In humans, decreased negative,

 ruminative thoughts have occurred in randomized con-
trolled trials after a month on probiotics [19], while pre-
biotics and the administration of pseudocommensals
(microbial species that do not live in the gastrointestinal
tract but due to presence in water and soil have had
continuously passed through the human gut in evolu-
tionary history) have decreased anxiety [20, 21]. The
rates of ADHD or autistic spectrum disorders in young
teenagers
supplemented
with
probiotics
as
infants
dropped to 0 % compared to controls in one fascinating
study [22]. In another paper, researchers were able to de-
termine the patients with and without depression with
100 % sensitivity and 97 % specificity just by looking at
the microbial genomes from fecal swabs [23]. The ad-
ministration of antibiotics with antidepressants had a
significant effect on psychotic depression compared to
antidepressants alone [24] in a small group of inpa-
tients. In addition, major differences have been found
between the oral microbiome of people with schizo-
phrenia vs. controls [25], and, not surprisingly, the
microbiome of people with anorexia is quite different
during disease behavior than in recovery [26]. Further
studies postulate a role between but microbiota and
Alzheimer’s dementia [27].
Having established there are some fascinating links be-
tween the microbiome and mental health, the challenges
to finding safe, actionable clinical data are profound.
One obvious obstacle is the sheer diversity of diagnoses
of mental illness, ameliorated somewhat by the goal of ad-
dressing underlying systemic inflammation with micro-
biome manipulation. That goal may not be as simple as it
sounds, given that the microbiome is a changeable entity
reacting to local stress, food intake, sleep, and baseline
conditions. One microbiome may be ideal for one person
and not for another with a different diet or situation. One-
size-fits-all probiotics may not show us the best clinical
effect. A more bespoke approach based on microbiome
sequencing and filling gaps of known guardian species
such as Bifidobacterium longum and Akkermnansia muci-
niphila [28] may be more effective. We need to also estab-
lish the benefit/risks of low vs. high-dose probiotic
supplementation and the utility of giving prebiotic fibers
and probiotics together.
Food intake is a massive confounder to any study of
the microbiome. Numerous studies show more trad-
itional, whole foods are superior for mental health [29].
While optimal levels of vitamins, minerals, and certain
fatty acids are key for brain functioning, these traditional
diets also tend to be higher in certain fibers and prebi-
otics whose benefits for the microbiome could explain
much of the effect of these diets on mental health [30,
31]. Clearly, we need to do more work and use the infor-
mation from studies designed to more carefully discern
the effects of diet, prebiotics, and probiotics on general
health. Numerous one-off studies of various probiotic
brands for mental disorders will leave us in a similar
state to those trying to glean some wisdom from the
research
on
omega
3
fatty
acids,
confused
and
underwhelmed.
In addition, attention must be paid to another long-
term modifier of the immune system in human evolu-
tionary history, ignored in many “psychobiotic” studies,
the eukaryotic helminths [32, 33]. Humans have coe-
volved with helminthic infection for the entire evolu-
tionary history of our species, and recent times are
striking for their absence. Since the early 1900s such
common infections such as hookworms and Enterobius
vermicularis in the developed world have decreased tre-
mendously [34, 35] with numerous possible downstream
effects on long-term immunity and host behavior. Para-
sitic contribution falls alongside that of the commensal
microbiome, and helminths deserve a chair at the table
of microbiome research in mental health. Helminths
have been used experimentally for treatment of auto-
immune diseases such as Crohn’s disease and multiple
sclerosis [36] with some interesting case reports of psy-
chiatric disorders (including anxiety disorders, affective
disorders, and autistic spectrum disorders) co-occuring
with the autoimmune disease remitting as well [37]. It
would be prudent to study helminthic therapies for
neuropsychiatric conditions, particularly in those condi-
tions such as OCD or some types of psychosis where
there is a suspected autoimmune contribution [38, 39].
Conclusions
Microbiome manipulation is an evolving tool in the
armamentarium
to
fight
mental
illness.
We
must
temper enthusiasm and marketing of any particular
probiotic strain or brand with a large helping of wis-
dom and experience already gleaned from the many
researchers becoming experts in this relatively new
field of human medicine. Multidisciplinary communi-
cation
among
medical
researchers,
anthropologists,
and physiologists can help us to modulate our mod-
ern environment to ameliorate the need for psycho-
biotics in the first place.
