The Onset Time Delaying Effect: Smokers vs Non-Smokers Place the Adverse Consequences 
of Smoking further in the Future 
Despite all the information about the risks, many people still smoke. Several studies 
investigated risk perceptions in smokers. The adequate perceptions of the risks from smoking 
is particularly important and this study investigated the risk perception of young smokers vs 
non-smokers by a new time-estimation task in which we required participants (smokers and 
non-smokers) to estimate the onset time of smoking-related conditions in an average young 
smoker. The findings supported our main hypothesis that smokers, compared to non-smokers, 
postponed the onset of both mild and severe smoking-related conditions. The results also 
revealed that the onset time estimates for mild conditions given by both smokers and non-
smokers were associated with their self-perceptions of risk and level of fear of developing 
smoking-related conditions. The findings cast light on smokers’ distorted temporal perception 
of the health-damaging consequences of smoking. Implications for the adequacy of risk 
perception in smokers are discussed.

Introduction 
Tobacco use causes more than 7 million annual deaths worldwide (World Health Organization, 
2017). In Italy, where the present study was conducted, there are 11.7 million smokers out of 52.4 
million people aged 15 years or older (22.3% of the population), 16.2% aged between 15 and 24 
years and 28% between 25 and 44 years according to a survey by DOXA/ISS in 2017 (Pacifici, 
2017). The World Health Organization estimated that 23.3%, 95% CI [19.5, 27.2], of the population 
in Italy were smokers in 2010 and it projects that 20.3%, 95% CI [14.8, 25.6], of the population will 
be smokers in 2025 if tobacco control is maintained at the same level (World Health Organization, 
2015). Despite the worldwide reduction in prevalence of daily smoking between 1990 and 2015, 
smoking represents one of the main risk factors for early death and disability (Reitsma et al., 2017). 
Notwithstanding the health-damaging consequences of smoking, many people decide to 
smoke. The question arises of whether smokers adequately perceive the harmful consequences of 
smoking and, more generally, whether they are risk under-sensitive or insensitive. This question is 
relevant as it might ultimately bear on the issue of whether smokers are “rational” decision makers 
with respect to smoking behaviour. In the literature, a debate has arisen around people’s adequacy 
of risk perceptions and, consequently, the soundness of people’s decisions. Viscusi (Viscusi & 
Hakes, 2008; Viscusi, 1990, 1992, 2000) reported data from surveys which varied in terms of the 
specific health outcome inquired about (i.e., lung cancer, smoking mortality risk, and life 
expectancy loss). The main finding was a consistent overestimation of the levels of risk associated 
with smoking compared to the scientific reference point (computed based on estimates of the US 
Surgeon General). In particular, the overestimation of the lung cancer risk was the greatest among 
younger people aged 16 to 21 (Viscusi, 2000). Viscusi explained the higher risk perceptions among 
young individuals as the result of their greater exposure to antismoking campaigns compared to 
older smokers. In turn, these high perceptions of the risks of smoking have an impact on society 
because they reduce the probability of smoking (Viscusi & Hakes, 2008; Viscusi, 1990). Indeed, 
 3 
 
Viscusi estimated that accurate, rather than overestimated, risk perceptions would raise the smoking 
rates by 6.5 to 7.5 percentage points (Viscusi, 2000). 
Viscusi’s conclusion that young smokers are well-informed and operate rationally given the 
information available to them and their preferences has been criticized by Slovic (1998, 2000a, 
2000b, 2001). Slovic’s critique is based on four main points: Viscusi’s questions fail to take into 
account the cumulative nature of risks from smoking and young people’s misperceptions of the 
addictive nature of smoking; they do not convey the severity of the consequences of smoking, and 
they are phrased so that they are prone to “optimism bias” (Slovic, 2000b). His critique is based on 
the influence of rapid and automatic experienced feelings (i.e., the “affect heuristic”; Finucane, 
Alhakami, Slovic, & Johnson, 2000; Slovic, 2001; Slovic, Peters, Finucane, & MacGregor, 2005) 
on human judgement and decision making. Experiential and affective thinking would lead young 
people to believe that smoking for only a few years is safe (they would thus ignore the cumulative 
risk from smoking), also because they underestimate the risk of becoming addicted and thus not 
being able to stop smoking (Arnett, 2000; Slovic, 1998, 2001). Slovic based his arguments on data 
from a survey that showed that the majority of the young and adult smokers thought a little or not at 
all about health risks when they first started to smoke, and they did not think about or they 
underestimated how long they would continue to smoke. Furthermore, most of young and adult 
smokers planned to quit smoking within the subsequent year and they thought they would 
successfully quit smoking in a year from the interview even though they had unsuccessfully 
attempted to quit 10 or more times before (Slovic, 2001). 
Slovic (1998), in line with other authors (Peretti-Watel et al., 2007), also argues against the 
interpretation of risk in terms of probability rather than the probability and the severity of 
consequences. People would judge the risk of catching a cold as higher than the risk from smoking 
if the risk estimate is elicited in terms of probability only rather than being phrased so that the 
severity of the smoking-related conditions is also transparent. Finally, Slovic criticizes Viscusi’s 
choice to ask people about the risk from smoking to others (i.e., “Among 100 cigarette smokers, 
 4 
 
how many of them do you think will get lung cancer because they smoke?”) and not to themselves. 
This question phrasing could induce an optimism bias, whereby people judge others’ risk to be 
higher than their own given the same conditions (Slovic, 1998; Weinstein, 1989, 1998). In 
particular, there is evidence that smokers underestimate their risk of lung cancer compared to non-
smokers and average smokers (Weinstein, Marcus, & Moser, 2005). More in general, smokers 
underestimate their health risks despite being aware of the harmful consequences of smoking 
(Arnett, 2000; Peretti-Watel et al., 2007, 2014). Optimism bias correlates with negative 
consequences because optimistic smokers have been found to hold rationalizing beliefs about lung 
cancer and to be less interested in quitting smoking (Dillard, McCaul, & Klein, 2006). 
In the current study the dependent variable was participants’ assessment of the onset time of 
smoking-related conditions (SRCs) such as yellow teeth, hypertension, lung cancer in an average 
smoker, and not directly of their own risk of mortality, life expectancy loss or developing a disease. 
The use of such new measures of the perceptions of the risks from smoking (e.g.,  measures 
different from risk preference questions) could help overcome some of the issues that could have 
affected previous measures (see, for example, the critical views on intertemporal choice tasks by 
Frederick, Loewenstein, & O’Donoghue, 2002; Scholten & Read, 2010; Van den Bos & McClure, 
2013). It could also clarify whether smokers’ beliefs of the smoking risks are adequate or not.  
Time Perception in Smokers vs Non-Smokers 
Our focus on time perception as a way to get insights into smokers’ risk perceptions is in 
keeping with theorising about the role of time considerations in addictions (Becker & Murphy, 
1988; Hall & Fong, 2007). Furthermore, in the attempt to account for smoking behaviour, several 
studies in the literature have provided empirical evidence for different time-related perceptions in 
smokers compared to non-smokers and ex-smokers. In their Theory of Rational Addiction, Becker 
and Murphy show that addiction is more likely for individuals who are present orientated rather 
than future orientated. In line with this model, tobacco addiction has been found to be associated 
with time perspective, which is a process whereby decisions are influenced by a focus on past, 
 5 
 
future or present considerations (Adams, 2009b; Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999). In a cross-sectional 
study, Keough and co-workers found that individuals who are higher in present time perspective 
report higher use of tobacco (Keough, Zimbardo, & Boyd, 1999). However, there are mixed 
findings on the causal link between future orientation and successful smoking cessation (Beenstock, 
Lindson-Hawley, Aveyard, & Adams, 2014; Hall, Fong, & Meng, 2014). 
Related to future orientation is the concept of time preference. Smokers, compared to non-
smokers and ex-smokers, exhibit greater time discounting, whereby smaller, immediate rewards are 
preferred over larger, delayed ones (Adams, 2009a, 2009b; Baker, Johnson, & Bickel, 2003; 
Barlow, McKee, Reeves, Galea, & Stuckler, 2016; Bickel et al., 2011; Bickel, Odum, & Madden, 
1999; Businelle, McVay, Kendzor, & Copeland, 2010; Friedel, Dehart, Madden, & Odum, 2014; 
Johnson, Bickel, & Baker, 2007; Mitchell, 1999; Ohmura, Takahashi, & Kitamura, 2016; Reynolds, 
Richards, Horn, & Karraker, 2004; Rezvanfard, Ekhtiari, Mokri, Djavid, & Kaviani, 2010). In other 
words, the perceived value of a reward (e.g., better health) decreases with its delay and this discount 
is faster in smokers vs non-smokers (Adams, 2009b; Barlow et al., 2016). Time discounting 
associated with smoking behaviour has been mainly studied by means of forced choices about 
hypothetical trade-offs at different times (e.g., a smaller amount of an outcome sooner vs a larger 
amount later) and across outcomes (e.g., cigarettes, money, health, food). A meta-analysis 
conducted by MacKillop and colleagues has found significantly higher time discounting in either 
clinical or subclinical groups of tobacco users than in control groups for 79% (15 out of 19) of the 
studies they analysed, with a medium-sized effect, Cohen’s d = .57, p < .0001 (MacKillop et al., 
2011). 
The studies on time discounting have focused on intertemporal choices and the value 
assigned to commodities over time. They tapped into a process that has been suggested to be 
indicative of the impulsivity of smokers (Friedel et al., 2014; Mitchell, 1999; Rezvanfard et al., 
2010) and that might be trait-like (Odum, 2011).

Smokers’ perceptions of the time at which the risks from smoking might develop could 
reveal an additional aspect of smokers’ time perception that is distinct from their time perspective 
and preferences. Smokers could perceive the negative consequences of smoking as delayed 
compared to non-smokers. The work by Hall and colleagues provides ground for this hypothesis by 
showing that young adults perceive the costs of smoking as being more distal than its benefits (Hall 
& Fong, 2007, Figure 3). Whether the adverse consequences of smoking are perceived as delayed 
not only relatively to the positive ones, but also in absolute terms is a question that we addressed in 
our study. 
The Present Study 
Although previous research has shown that smokers, compared to non-smokers and ex-
smokers, place less value on events that will occur in the future (Adams, 2009b), no study has yet 
shown that smokers also place the adverse consequences of smoking further in the future compared 
to non-smokers. Perceived benefits of smoking occur early, while the health-related costs of 
smoking come at a delay (Barlow et al., 2016; Hall & Fong, 2007). Smokers, compared to non-
smokers, could perceive the costs of smoking as further delayed in a similar way as they tend to 
overly devalue the delayed benefits of smoking. More precisely, to the best of our knowledge, there 
is no empirical investigation on the perceptions of smokers, compared to non-smokers, of the onset 
time of SRCs. Examining the perceptions of the risks of smoking from the standpoint of their 
perceived time onset could provide a novel perspective on smokers’ judgement and decision 
making. In particular, such an investigation could provide insights into smokers’ choices of starting, 
quitting smoking, and screening for SRCs. In the current study, we used this new, indirect measure 
of risk perception in combination with direct measures of participants’ perceptions of their own risk 
and fear to develop SRCs. Fear-related reactions have mostly been investigated in relation to the 
influence of fear appeals and threat communication on behaviour change (Cameron, Pepper, & 
Brewer, 2015; Kok, Bartholomew, Parcel, Gottlieb, & Fernández, 2014; Peters, Ruiter, & Kok, 
2013; Witte & Allen, 2000). A novel contribution of the current study was to consider risk and fear 
 7 
 
separately and to investigate the association of one’s own risk perception (RP) and level of fear 
(LF) of developing SRCs with the estimated onset time of those conditions in an average smoker. 
Based on previous findings on smokers’ impatience for rewards (Ert, Yechiam, & 
Arshavsky, 2013; Yamane et al., 2013), we hypothesized a reverse effect where the negative 
consequences of smoking are concerned. Specifically, we expected that smokers should delay the 
onset time of SRCs compared to non-smokers. We also explored whether the RP and LF of 
developing SRCs could be associated with the onset time delaying. In particular, one’s own RP and 
LF could be differently associated with the onset time delaying as a function of the severity of the 
consequences of smoking. In particular, we hypothesised that smokers would perceive the severe 
consequences of smoking (e.g., lung cancer) as more temporally remote than the mild ones (e.g., 
yellow teeth) and, accordingly, the associated perceived own risk and fear could play a different 
role for the two different types of SRCs. 
Method 
Participants 
One hundred and seventy-two participants with an age comprised between 18 and 35 were recruited 
with a snowball sampling method for the present study. There were a total of 60 smokers, 102 non-
smokers, and 10 former smokers. Since former smokers were too few, they were excluded from the 
analysis, thus the total sample comprised 162 participants. Beside age, the following participation 
criteria were established: smokers had to be habitual consumers (at least one cigarette per day for at 
least one year) of packed or hand-made cigarettes, whereas non-smokers were enrolled only if they 
had no history of smoking. For the purpose of simplicity, we will refer to the two subsamples 
(smokers vs. non-smokers) as “smoking status”. 
The smokers sample was composed of 30 males and 30 females (Mage = 24.22, SDage = 
2.68). They smoked from 2 to 25 cigarettes a day (M = 10.23, SD = 5.43). The score at the 
 8 
 
Fagerström Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND; Heatherton, Kozlowski, Frecker, & Fagerström, 
1991) indicated that smokers had a low dependence level (M = 2.37, SD = 1.52). The non-smokers 
sample was composed of 19 males and 83 females (Mage = 25.64, SDage = 3.71). All the participants 
were volunteers. 
Materials and procedure 
The present study was advertised by social networks. Individuals interested in participating were 
contacted via email and they were given a link to a survey on SurveyMonkey,® an internet-based 
survey tool. At that link, participants found a brief introduction about the kind of questions included 
in the survey, some instructions to complete it (e.g., read the questions carefully, be sincere, etc.), 
and the consent form approved by the ethical committee of a large Italian university. 
The following 15 SRCs were selected from a list of commonly perceived outcomes of 
smoking by two scholars who have worked on smoking dependence for years: “Gingivitis”, 
“Asthma”, “Sore throat”, “Shortness of breath”, “Yellow teeth”, “Tachycardia”, “Halitosis”, 
“Premature skin aging”, “Chronic bronchitis”, “Sexual dysfunctions”, “Pulmonary emphysema”, 
“Hypertension”, “Lung cancer”, “Heart attack”, “Ictus”. The SRCs were then used as items in three 
instruments developed ad hoc for the present study. 
The first two instruments aimed at measuring risk perception (RP) and level of fear (LF) for 
the SRCs on 5-point Likert scales. RP was assessed by asking participants to evaluate their own 
likelihood to develop each SRC, from 1 “Not likely at all” to 5 “Extremely likely”. LF was 
measured asking participants how much they were afraid of developing each SRC, from 1 “Not at 
all” to 5 “Extremely”. Thus, while the RP measure was meant to tap into participants’ perceived 
likelihood of developing the SRCs, the LF measure aimed at gauging the magnitude of fear 
participants felt about developing them. 
The third instrument aimed at measuring the onset time delaying (OTD) of the SRCs, that is, 
the perceived onset time of each SRC. With reference to an individual who starts smoking 10 
 9 
 
cigarettes a day, participants were asked to estimate the temporal distance between smoking 
initiation and the onset of a SRC on a 9-point Likert scale with the following options: one month 
(1), three months (2), one year (3), five years (4), ten years (5), twenty years (6), thirty years (7), 
more than thirty years (8), never (9). We did not use open-ended questions as they could be 
problematic. Given that this type of time estimates is not routinely required from individuals in their 
everyday life, there could be an increase in statistical noise in this measure if open-ended questions 
were used. Thus, similarly to the temporal proximity measure (Hall & Fong, 2007), we provided 
participants with pre-set options to select in order to facilitate their task (for a similar argument 
regarding measures of time and risk preference see (Goto, Takahashi, Nishimura, & Ida, 2009). Not 
only anchors could facilitate participants’ task, but they also provided us with a common response 
scale for all the participants, which was crucial to compare the predictions between smokers and 
non-smokers on the same basis. The difference between response options was larger for references 
that were temporally remote than for the proximal ones. This is a common strategy adopted by 
several authors to avoid issues caused by the vividness of events in measures that involve time 
(Arnold, McDermott, & Szpunar, 2011; Caruso, Van Boven, Chin, & Ward, 2013; Rinaldi, Locati, 
Parolin, & Girelli, 2017; Rinaldi, Vecchi, Fantino, Merabet, & Cattaneo, in press). However, to 
avoid any possible bias in participants’ estimates of the onset time of a smoking-related condition, 
the anchors spanned a wide timeline, from one month to never.   
Finally, participants were asked to provide their age, gender, and their current smoking 
status (SS) choosing one of the following options: current smoker, former smoker, never smoker. 
The questionnaire ended for the two latter smoking status, whereas smokers were asked to complete 
the FTND (Heatherton et al., 1991) in order to assess their nicotine dependence. The FTND is a 6-
item questionnaire validated in an Italian sample (Ferketich, Fossati, & Apolone, 2008) and it is the 
most widely used self-reported measure of nicotine dependence.

Data analysis 
The analysis was conducted in two steps. In the first step, we performed an exploratory factor 
analysis (EFA) for each instrument (i.e.: RP, LF, and OTD scales) in order to identify a small 
number of dimensions that could account for the SRCs. The EFAs were performed on the 
polychoric correlation matrices, using the principal axis factoring method. The optimal number of 
factors was determined through a parallel analysis (Horn, 1965), comparing the extracted empirical 
eigenvalues with those obtained by 100 simulations. As indicated in the literature (Cota, Longman, 
Holden, Fekken, & Xinaris, 1993; Glorfeld, 1995), we retained only the factors associated to 
eigenvalues higher than 95th percentile of those computed by the simulations. The rotation method 
was chosen according to the correlations between the extracted factors. The ultimate aim of the 
EFAs was to find a common dimensionality for the three scales, which was essential to explore 
possible differences between smoking-related conditions. In other words, we needed to identify 
items that showed clear loadings on the same factor in each of the EFAs. Loadings were evaluated 
computing the marker index (Gallucci & Perugini, 2007): values lower than 0.40 indicate low 
primary loading and/or multiple loadings, suggesting the possibility to delete the item and rerun the 
EFA without it. Once the common factors were identified, factors’ scores were computed as the 
mean of the responses to their items. Factors means within each construct (i.e., RP, LF, OTD) were 
then compared to detect differences and Cronbach’s alpha was computed to assess the internal 
consistency of the subscales.  
In the second step of the analysis, we performed a stepwise backward regression analysis for 
each common factor identified in the EFAs. Specifically, OTD was considered as dependent 
variable, whereas RP, LF, and SS as predictors (the non-smokers group was used as reference 
category). Besides main effects, we included the second- and third-order interaction terms. Thus, 
starting from the full model, non-significant higher order terms were eliminated one at a time, in 
order to obtain a final, more parsimonious model. Simple slope analysis was performed to 
 11 
 
investigate the interactions, in order to test the effect of RP on OTD for the two groups (smokers 
and non-smokers), using LF at one standard deviation above and below its mean. As suggested by 
Jaccard and Turrisi (2003), the continuous independent variables (i.e., RP and LF) were mean-
centered. 
Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 23 (IBM Corp., 2015), and R 
statistical software, version 3.2.3 (R Core Team, 2013). 
Results 
Dimensionality of the instruments 
The parallel analyses (Horn, 1965) conducted on the three instruments that we introduced for this 
study (i.e., RP, LF, and OTD scales) yielded the same results, indicating that the first two 
empirically extracted factors were associated to eigenvalues higher than the 95th percentile of the 
simulated eigenvalues. Accordingly, we performed an EFA for each of the scales extracting two 
factors. The correlation between the two factors was moderate for the LF instrument (r = .46) and 
strong for RP and OTD instruments (.67 and .62, respectively), thus a promax oblique rotation was 
applied.   
Table 1 shows the results of the EFAs performed on the three instruments. A careful 
examination of the loadings and marker indices was carried out, comparing the EFAs results in 
order to identify the items that commonly constitute the two factors in all the instruments. Four 
items with complex loadings were detected. “Asthma”, “Chronic bronchitis”, “Premature skin 
aging”, and “Sexual dysfunctions” showed multiple loadings and an unacceptable marker index at 
least for one of the instruments, thus they were considered complex items and excluded from the 
computation of the factors’ scores. In contrast, the remaining items showed adequate marker indices 
and clear primary loadings for all of the instruments. Specifically, the first common factor (F1) was 
loaded by the following items: “Gingivitis”, “Sore throat”, “Shortness of breath”, “Yellow teeth”, 
 12 
 
“Halitosis”, “Tachycardia”, and “Hypertension”. These items represent mild SRCs relative to 
physical appearance, with the exception of the latter. Indeed, hypertension is a serious disease, but 
its scarce impact on everyday activities could have led participants to assimilate hypertension to the 
other mild SRCs. Based on these considerations, F1 was called “Mild SRCs”. The second common 
factor (F2) was loaded by “Pulmonary emphysema”, “Lung cancer”, “Heart attack”, and “Ictus”. 
These items represent very severe SRCs; hence F2 was called “Severe SRCs”. 
[Table 1 about here] 
Based on these results, we computed the means of the items that loaded on the identified 
factors, thus obtaining six scores, three regarding the Mild SRCs common factors (RPMild, LFMild, 
and OTDMild) and three regarding the Severe SRCs common factor (RPSevere, LFSevere, and 
OTDSevere). Paired samples t-tests detected significant differences between mild and severe SRCs 
for RP [t(161) = 5.50, p < .001, d = 0.43], LF [t(161) = 16.17, p < .001, d = 1.27], and OTD [t(161) 
= 28.94, p < .001, d = 2.27]. In particular, RPMild (M = 2.96, SD = 0.82) was higher than RPSevere (M 
= 2.62, SD = 0.86), LFMild (M = 2.50, SD = 0.88) was lower than LFSevere (M = 3.88, SD = 1.04), 
and OTDMild (M = 3.88, SD = 1.31) was lower than OTDSevere (M = 6.59, SD = 1.15). The identified 
factors showed high internal consistency, yielding Cronbach’s alpha coefficients between .86 (for 
RPMild) and .91 (for OTDSevere). 
Onset time delaying 
Based on the analysis of dimensionality, we conducted two distinct but equivalent regression 
models, one related to mild SRCs (M1) and the other one to severe SRCs (M2). Before performing 
these models, a correlation analysis was carried out on the whole sample to exclude any possible 
confounding effect related to the participants’ gender. In addition, a correlation analysis was 
conducted on the subsample of smokers, in order to check whether the number of cigarettes smoked 
per day or the dependence level measured using the FTND were associated with the study variables. 
Results indicated that none of the factors identified in the previous dimensionality analysis were 
 13 
 
significantly correlated with gender, the number of cigarettes or the FTND score (please, see Table 
2), thus there was no need to include these variables in the following models. 
[Table 2 about here] 
For both M1 and M2, full models were initially tested, excluding non-significant higher 
order predictors one at a time. Table 3 shows the results of the final, most parsimonious models, 
which are also graphically displayed in Figure 1 and Figure 2.  
[Table 3 about here] 
[Figures 1 and 2 about here] 
Both models were significant: M1 explained about 17% of OTDMild variance [R² = .17, 
F(4,157) = 8.10, p < .001], whereas M2 accounted for about 6% of OTDSevere variance [R² = .06, 
F(3,158) = 3.52, p = .02]. Smoking status showed a significant main effect in both M1 and M2. As 
can be seen in Figure 1, the perceived onset time was delayed for smokers vs. non-smokers 
regardless of the severity of the smoking-related conditions. The remaining predictors did not show 
any significant main effect, neither for M1 nor for M2. Moreover, in both models no higher order 
effects were detected, except for the significant interaction between RPMild and LFMild. A simple 
slope analysis was conducted on the interaction term for M1 to test whether it was significant at 
both high and low levels of the moderator, thus at one standard deviation above and below the LF 
mean. On one hand, when the level of fear was low, the perceived risk of mild diseases did not 
affect the disease onset estimates [b = .18, t(157) = 1.26, p = .21]. On the other hand, when the level 
of fear was high, the higher the perceived risk, the closer the estimated onset time [b = -.48, t(157) = 
-2.83, p = .01]. 
Discussion 
This is the first study to illustrate an onset time delaying of the adverse consequences of smoking in 
smokers compared to non-smokers. We asked participants to estimate the months or years that 
occur before a SRC might develop in a person who starts smoking 10 cigarettes a day at 18 years 
 14 
 
old. We categorized SRCs into mild (e.g., yellow teeth, halitosis) vs severe (e.g., lung cancer, ictus) 
ones based on the two factors extracted from EFAs conducted on three newly introduced 
instruments that measure risk perception (RP), level of fear (LF), and onset time delaying (OTD), 
respectively. The main finding was that smokers, compared to non-smokers, delayed onset times for 
both mild and severe SRCs. This result provides evidence for a difference between smokers and 
non-smokers in the time perception of the adverse consequences of smoking. It thus adds to the 
literature by showing that the onset time delay is another time-related concept that could 
discriminate between smokers and non-smokers and thus it could represent another cognitive risk 
factor for smoking along with time discounting (Barlow et al., 2016). Not only smokers do place 
less value on future rewards than non-smokers, but they also place the adverse consequences of 
smoking further in the future compared to non-smokers. This finding dovetails with the greater 
perceived temporal proximity for the benefits vs costs of smoking found by Hall and Fong (2007). 
It also further specifies Slovic’s data showing the inadequate time expectations of smokers, in 
particular young smokers, as to how long they would keep smoking before any smoking-related 
health damage could occur (Slovic, 2001). 
Optimism Bias 
We introduced the onset time measure to get insights into the perceptions of the risks from 
smoking in smokers vs non-smokers. Past research has shown that smokers believe that they are 
less at risk of the health-damaging consequences of smoking than the average smoker, thus they 
show an optimism bias (Slovic, 1998; Weinstein, 1989, 1998; Weinstein et al., 2005). Asking 
smokers questions about the risk of others and not of themselves might prevent scholars from 
detecting inadequate risk perceptions in smokers because of such an optimism bias. In our study too 
we asked participants to make onset time estimates with reference to an average smoker and not to 
themselves. Thus, the optimism bias could have affected our smoker participants’ estimates. We do 
not have data to compare smokers’ estimates with reference to themselves vs an average smoker, 
and thus we cannot draw conclusions about the role of optimism bias in participants’ estimates. 
 15 
 
However, an optimism bias would entail more delayed (and thus associated with lower risks) 
estimates of the onset of SRCs for oneself compared to an average smoker. We found that smokers’ 
estimates were more delayed, and thus optimistic, if compared to non-smokers’ estimates. This 
suggests that even in the case of optimistic estimates about themselves, the smokers’ estimates 
about the average smoker would still be not as conservative as the non-smokers’ estimates. To more 
squarely test the optimism bias in this context, future research should investigate whether the onset 
time delaying effect is even larger (even more delayed estimates are given) when smokers refer to 
themselves rather than an average smoker, and thus they might be more optimistic about the onset 
time of SRCs for themselves compared to that for an average smoker. Nevertheless, we could 
expect a similar but more extreme pattern of results when smokers refer to themselves, suggesting 
that the optimism bias could be found for both the smokers themselves as well as an average 
smoker.  
The Role of Self Perceptions of Risk and Fear 
Although we found the onset time delaying effect for both mild (M1) and severe (M2) 
SRCs, we detected an association between OTD and RP and LF only in M1. For both smokers and 
non-smokers, RP significantly interacted with LF in predicting the onset time of mild SRCs. For 
low levels of fear, RP was not associated with the onset time estimates of mild SRCs. Conversely, 
for high levels of fear, the increase of RP was associated with a decrease in the onset time estimates, 
which means that onset times for mild SRCs were less delayed. This result shows that one’s own 
RP and LF are jointly associated with the time perception of the health consequences of smoking in 
others. In particular, the health consequences are perceived as closer in time only when both one’s 
own risk and fear are perceived as high. Furthermore, these self-perceptions are associated with the 
time perception of others’ mild SRCs regardless of the smoking status. Unfortunately, the study 
design did not make it possible to establish any causal relationship between the self-perceptions of 
risk and fear and the onset times for mild SRCs. Although it is possible that the onset time estimates 
determine the self-perceptions of risk and fear, the interpretation of the interaction between RP and 
 16 
 
LF in the opposite way would be in line with some studies that have investigated the effect of 
warning labels on packets of cigarettes (Borland et al., 2009; Hammond, Fong, McDonald, Brown, 
& Cameron, 2004). These studies found that the stronger the warnings the greater the reaction of 
smokers to them, and this mechanism positively influences the likelihood of quitting attempts and 
of an actual cessation. In other words, fear provokes some reactions that have an impact on both 
cognition (e.g., development of an intention to quit) and smoking behaviour (e.g., reduction or 
cessation). Future studies could investigate whether fear could cause a cognitive reaction 
represented by the moderation of the relationship between risk perception and the onset time 
estimate of smoking-related conditions. The consequences of fear on time perception in relation to a 
change in smoking behaviour could also be the object of future research given the possible 
implications for interventions.  
However, the interaction between RP and LF was detected only when mild SRCs were 
considered. This result could depend on the difference between the onset time estimates for mild vs 
severe SRCs. Severe pathologies such as lung cancer are usually developed after a relatively long 
smoking history, whereas mild SRCs such as yellow teeth or halitosis are very common among 
smokers, even after a few months of smoking. Thus, it is not surprising that participants estimated 
the onset time of mild SRCs as more proximal than the onset of severe ones (Figures 1-2), mainly 
because participants were asked to refer to a medium smoker who started smoking at 18 years old. 
We argue that for severe SRCs the onset was perceived so temporally remote from smoking 
initiation that the levels of one’s own fear and risk were not differentially associated with the onset-
time estimates.  
Implications for Interventions and Future Directions 
Our study further specifies past research that shows that time perception can be distorted in 
smokers. Not only smokers devalue delayed rewards (Bickel et al., 1999; Reynolds et al., 2004; 
Yamane et al., 2013), they are less future orientated (Keough et al., 1999), and they perceive the 
costs from smoking as more temporally remote than its benefits (Hall & Fong, 2007), but smokers, 
 17 
 
compared to non-smokers, also postpone the onset of the health-damaging consequences of 
smoking. Future studies should investigate whether this result could be replicated when participants 
are asked to refer to themselves and also to smokers with different smoking histories. Along the 
same lines, these results could pave the way for future investigations looking at more finer-grained 
aspects. Our sample encompassed smokers with a low dependence level according to the FTND. 
Future studies should investigate the onset time delaying effect at higher levels of tobacco 
dependence to cast light on whether this effect is moderated by the smokers’ dependence level. 
Furthermore, other self-report measures of smoking dependence (e.g., the Cigarette Dependence 
Scale; Etter, Le Houezec, & Perneger, 2003) that have been found to be significantly more 
informative than FTND (Courvoisier & Etter, 2008) could be used to obtain a more precise measure 
of the exact level of smokers’ dependence. Relatedly, the motives behind tobacco dependence and 
the corresponding types of smokers could interact with RP and LF to shape different temporal 
perceptions of SRCs (Pancani et al., 2015; Piper et al., 2008). 
Our findings bear implications on cessation-promotion interventions. Previous research has 
shown that valuing future outcomes is associated with an increased likelihood of smoking cessation 
and a decreased likelihood of relapse (e.g., Adams, 2009b). Interventions based on the manipulation 
of the perceived onset time of the adverse consequences of smoking could be tested to assess their 
efficacy in preventing smoking initiation and promoting smoking cessation. Furthermore, our 
measure of the temporal perception of SRCs’ onset could be used to access smokers’ beliefs about 
screening programmes, their perceived barriers to screening and the factors underlying their 
intention to screen. Indeed, Silvestri and colleagues have shown that smokers have different 
perceptions from non-smokers about screening for lung cancer (Silvestri, Nietert, Zoller, Carter, & 
Bradford, 2007). Furthermore, it could give us insights into whether and why people consider or not 
starting or quitting smoking. This is the first study that shows that the adverse consequences of a 
health-damaging behaviour (smoking) are considered as more temporally remote by people who 
adopt that behaviour than people who refrain from it. This onset time delay effect could extend 
 18 
 
beyond smoking behaviour. It has been argued that another phenomenon of time misperception, 
namely time discounting, characterises several disorders and maladaptive behaviours, from drug 
addiction to gambling and risky sexual behaviours, and it has thus been called “trans-disease 
process” (Bickel, Jarmolowicz, Mueller, Koffarnus, & Gatchalian, 2012). Whether the time 
misperception of the negative consequences of a unhealthy behaviour could similarly represent a 
“trans-disease process” shared between different disorders and health-damaging behaviours needs 
to be addressed in future investigations (Barlow et al., 2016; Bickel et al., 2012). Specifically, the 
perceived delay of negative consequences might be observed for behaviours such as excessive 
alcohol use or high-calorie food consumption, but also for new problematic behaviours such as 
Internet addiction or smartphone overuse.
