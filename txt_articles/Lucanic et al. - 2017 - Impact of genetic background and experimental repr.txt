Limiting the debilitating consequences of ageing is a major medical challenge of our time.
Robust pharmacological interventions that promote healthy ageing across diverse genetic
backgrounds may engage conserved longevity pathways. Here we report results from
the Caenorhabditis Intervention Testing Program in assessing longevity variation across
22 Caenorhabditis strains spanning 3 species, using multiple replicates collected across three
independent laboratories. Reproducibility between test sites is high, whereas individual trial
reproducibility is relatively low. Of ten pro-longevity chemicals tested, six significantly extend
lifespan in at least one strain. Three reported dietary restriction mimetics are mainly effective
across C. elegans strains, indicating species and strain-specific responses. In contrast, the
amyloid dye ThioflavinT is both potent and robust across the strains. Our results highlight
promising pharmacological leads and demonstrate the importance of assessing lifespans of
discrete cohorts across repeat studies to capture biological variation in the search for
reproducible ageing interventions.

 C
onsiderable research effort is currently devoted to defining
effective approaches towards healthspan extension, some
with an
emphasis
on pharmacological interventions
that prolong life. Success in this arena is likely to be derived
from
studies
that
target
conserved
pathways
and
exploit
the complementary advantages of multiple model systems1–5.
The Caenorhabditis genus contains remarkable genetic diversity6,
exhibits relatively short lifespans and in general includes
tractable model organisms. Collectively, these features allow for
relatively inexpensive lifespan studies spanning diverse genetic
backgrounds, which can be completed on a timescale of months.
As importantly, C. elegans has long served as an important model
system for understanding the biological basis of ageing, going
back to the first discovery of genes responsible for extended
longevity7–10. To address concerns about reproducibility and to
identify compounds that extend lifespan in a robust manner, we
created the Caenorhabditis Intervention Testing Program (CITP),
a joint effort between the National Institutes of Health and three
geographically
separated
research
labs
(Buck
Institute
for
Research on Ageing, Rutgers University and the University of
Oregon). Here our fundamental goal is to identify compounds
that confer reproducible lifespan extension and health benefits to
a genetically diverse panel of Caenorhabditis strains and species
based on the idea that compounds with robust effects across a
genetically heterogeneous population would have the highest
probability of engaging conserved biochemical pathways that
promote healthy ageing.
Reproducibility is considered a cornerstone of experimental
science. At least one study has estimated the cost of flawed
or irreproducible research at $28 billion per year in the United
States alone, with 65% of this cost incurred by the pharmaceutical
industry11. There are many reasons why studies may exhibit poor
reproducibility. In molecular and cell biology, sources of variation
include the quality and purity of reagents, uncontrollable daily
fluctuations in microenvironment and idiosyncratic techniques of
investigators12. When conducting animal experiments an even
larger number of factors such as nutrients, genetic backgrounds
and housing conditions may influence the observations13,14.
Studies involving complex phenotypes such as ageing may be
particularly sensitive to subtle alterations in such difficult to
control factors. It has long been recognized that the lifespan
phenotype exhibits stochasticity and therefore is highly variable
across even closely related individuals from isogenic species15–17.
Experiments
reporting
the
positive
effects
of
drug-like
molecules
have
in
particular
often
failed
in
independent
laboratories, a phenomenon recognized in the wider biomedical
literature18–21.
Despite
these
confounding
phenomena,
identifying pharmaceutical interventions that mitigate ageing
and age-related chronic diseases is so potentially beneficial to
society that the number of studies will, and should, increase
dramatically in the future. To advance the goal of identifying
pharmaceutical lead compounds, combat the variability of
lifespan assays and establish rigorous testing methodology, the
National Institute on Ageing assembled the Intervention Testing
Program (ITP)22. Subsequently, this group has demonstrated
effectively that multiple chemicals can increase the lifespan of
genetically heterogenous mice23–26.
The CITP constitutes an independent, but complementary
effort to the ITP, anticipated to allow a higher throughput
analysis of candidate healthspan interventions. Invertebrates offer
relatively rapid assessment of potential chemicals, thereby
allowing for both higher throughput screening and greater
sampling of genetic diversity. This is a key point, as it is likely
to be critical to identify those compounds that robustly extend
lifespan in multiple genetic backgrounds, to allow researchers to
prioritize which chemicals to test in more complex organisms.
Here we describe results from parallel replicate studies on
the lifespans and life history traits of 22 Caenorhabditis natural
isolates (strains), and further report the identification of several
compounds that either promoted long life in a species specific
manner or were generally effective across species.
Results
Developmental phenotypes and reproducibility. We chose 22
Caenorhabditis natural isolates spanning three species (C. brigg-
sae, C. elegans and C. tropicalis) to maximize sampling of genetic
and geographic diversity within each species27,28. In terms of total
divergence, the genetic differences encompassed among these
strains is comparable to sampling genomes from mice to
humans27. We first tested whether the three independent labs
could reproducibly score two major life history traits; the
developmental time to reproductive adulthood (egg laid to
adult deposition of the first egg), referred to as a-time and
hermaphrodite self-fertility (total number of viable progeny).
These studies also served to inform on the general health of the
natural
variant
strains
under
the
culture
conditions
we
established to test compound-based ageing interventions.
We
determined
the
a-time
for
the
22
strains
(41,800 observations; see Supplementary Data 1 and 6), finding
that the developmental rate at 20 �C is slightly delayed in
C. tropicalis strains relative to C. briggsae and C. elegans, with
good agreement among labs (Fig. 1a). Indeed, partitioning
variation among potential sources of error using a general linear
model (GLM) indicated that there was very little systematic
difference among outcomes at the three laboratories (Table 1 and
Supplementary Table 1), although there were some lab-specific
differences among species and strains (roughly 4% of the total
variance attributable to each source). The key finding was that the
vast amount of variation (79%) was attributed to genetic variation
among strains and species. These data suggest that growth
conditions and practices for developmental time analysis were
uniform across labs.
We also assayed hermaphrodite self-fertility under our culture
conditions. Each of the species used here reproduces as
self-fertilizing hermaphrodites and are limited by sperm produc-
tion during development.
The self-fertility
of each strain
was determined by counting the number of viable progeny born
from individual animals. In general the C. elegans strains
exhibited
the
highest
fertility,
with
strain
QX1211
the
clear outlier (Fig. 1b). QX1211 exhibited lower fertility than any
other strain and was observed to lay many eggs that failed to
hatch (unquantified observations), indicating some level of
embryonic lethality. As with the developmental rate results,
we found that self-fertility scores were reproducible among labs
(1% variance among labs), with slightly larger lab-specific
differences among strains than observed for a-time (Table 1).
Variation
in
fertility
under
our
lab
conditions
can
be
assigned primarily to genetic background (63%) and ‘random’
(unexplained) differences among individual animals (23%).
Importantly, the data again support little systematic difference
in scores (and therefore in culture conditions) across the three
CITP laboratories.
Some Caenorhabditis strain differences are due to genetics. We
cultured each of the 22 natural isolates under standardized con-
ditions and scored survival, with each trial being initiated with
Z105 adults distributed over three technical replicate plates. All
CITP sites collected data from three biological replicate trials
(21,143 observations; experimental details in Methods section and
Supplementary Data 3 and 8). We observed broad differences in
longevity among test strains spanning a twofold range at 20 �C

 (Fig. 2). We found strong, repeatable differences in the average
mortality dynamics among the three species, as well as among
strains within species (Fig. 2). In general, both C. briggsae and C.
tropicalis live longer than C. elegans. However, whereas both C.
briggsae and C. tropicalis have reduced early life mortality relative
to C. elegans, C. briggsae continues a pattern of reduced mortality
throughout life; the mortality rate in C. tropicalis tends to increase
late in life such that its maximum lifespan ends up being fairly
comparable to C. elegans. Natural isolates within each species also
differed from one another in terms of their lifespan, with dif-
ferences in median lifespan generally ranging from 3 to 7 days
within each species (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The clear
outlier is C. briggsae strain HK104, whose median lifespan is 30%
longer than any other Caenorhabditis natural isolate in our
analysis, including other C. briggsae strains. Genetic differences
account for roughly 20% of the total variation in longevity
observed (12% among species and 8% among strains within
species; Table 2).
Minimal among-lab variation in lifespan. Given that a critical
component of the CITP plan is to reproduce findings among labs,
we examined reproducibility of longevity data at three primary
levels: variability in outcomes among labs, variability of outcomes
among replicates within labs and sensitivity of outcomes to
genetic variation within and among species. Partitioning variation
in longevity to different potential sources of variation in a hier-
archical manner using a GLM (see Methods), we determined that
reproducibility for longevity measurements across the three
laboratories is extremely high, with on average there being no
differences at all among labs (Fig. 2, Table 2 and Supplementary
Table 2). Although there were effectively no systematic differ-
ences among laboratories, there is some indication of hetero-
geneous, strain-specific differences among laboratories, with
laboratory-specific species and laboratory-specific strain results,
respectively, accounting for o1% and 7% of the total variation.
As the variation among laboratories was minor relative to other
sources of variation, we infer that our strict adherence to uniform
procedures was successful in largely eliminating systematic dif-
ferences in lifespan outcomes among labs.
Replicate variation within each laboratory is relatively high.
Interestingly, although we found that systematic differences
among labs were minor, we calculated replicate-to-replicate
variation within each lab to be relatively high. After accounting
for other sources of variation, strong among-replicate differences
remained, representing roughly 15% of the total variation in

 individual lifespan observed in our study (9% derived from
the trial-specific effects, 6% from the among-plate in same trial
differences and none from experimenter-specific differences).
Thus, although the results obtained on any given day of a repli-
cate trial tended to be fairly consistent with one another,
conducting the same assay a month later could yield results as
different as looking at a strain from a different species.
Given that we observe a relatively large amount of variation
among trials across each of the three labs, despite strict adherence
to standardized procedures and culture conditions, we conclude
that a major challenge to reproducibility in this system may arise
from trial-specific cohort responses to unidentified and appar-
ently subtle differences in the assay environment, which vary
similarly within each laboratory.
Bimodal ageing for C. briggsae replicates. The observed among-
trial variation could simply be a random byproduct of tracking
a phenotype (longevity) that is unlikely to be under tight
regulatory control. Indeed, the large amount of residual variation
in longevity (57%) is consistent with longevity being an inher-
ently variable trait. However, the strikingly discrete nature
of among-replicate variation for some lines, especially within
C. briggsae strains, suggests that fundamental biology may
underlie
the
observed
trial-specific
differences
in
lifespan
outcomes (Fig. 3). For example, strain JU1264 exhibited distinct
clusters of longevity trajectories across the different trials:
cohorts either showed high early mortality or long life (Fig. 3).
The absence of intermediate outcomes suggests that even
populations reared under tightly controlled conditions may
shift between discrete physiological states, perhaps induced by
some
unmeasured/unknown
environmental
factor.
The
propensity of a given strain to display distinct longevity
trajectories varied from lab to lab, although all labs observed
this phenomenon for one strain or another. C. elegans and
C. tropicalis also displayed some degree of strain-specific
differences of among-trial variation, although distinct differences
in longevity trajectories are less obvious in these species than in
C. briggsae (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3). If this state-shift
is a general feature of this system, then reproducibility ‘error’

total range of observed longevity for each of the 728 experimental replicates (plates) from three laboratories measured across the three species and
22 natural isolates measured in this study. The cause of plate-to-plate differences in responses can be attributed to different sources using a hierarchical
analysis that partitions the total observed variation to known sources of genetic differences and replication error. Overall, the average longevity across
the entire experiment did not differ across the three laboratories (b), although there were species- and strain-specific responses that varied from lab to
lab (c). There were also distinct differences among species (d), but in fact more variation among strains within species (e). Relative percentages of the total

without
further
knowledge of its root causes. At present, our controlled studies
suggest that investigator, site, plate or reagent batch, overall
temperature and humidity, and generational epigenetic factors

Analysis of variation in intervention lifespan outcomes.
Our initial characterizations identified a twofold range in median
lifespan represented among the strains, which provides a strong
substrate of diversity for testing generalized effects of compound
interventions. To keep the experimental design logistically tract-
able for our initial test set of ten compounds, we focused on
outcomes with three C. elegans strains and three C. briggsae
strains that had fared well under lab growth conditions
(46,231 observations; experimental details in Methods and
Supplementary Data 4 and 9). The strains we selected captured
the range of longevities that we had observed in our initial broad
survey. For the first intervention studies we selected ten chemicals
that had either attracted particular interest in the ageing field
(aspirin29 and resveratrol21), were previously reported to extend
the lifespan of the C. elegans strain N2 (a-ketoglutarate (a-KG)30,
curcumin31, a-lipoic acid (a-LA)32, propyl gallate (PG)32,
quercetin33,34
and
valproic
acid
(VA)35)
and/or
appeared
particularly robust when given to N2 in our own laboratories
((NP1)36 and ThioflavinT (ThT)31).
Another consideration for the initial test set was that the
compounds had been predicted to influence ageing by a range of
primary mechanisms. For example, ThT promotes protein
homeostasis31 and VA extends lifespan via activation of the
transcription factor DAF-16 (ref. 35), whereas NP1, a-KG and
resveratrol had all been reported to act as dietary restriction (DR)
mimetics. To begin to assess variability in lifespan assays
involving
chemical
treatments,
we
first
tested
a
single
concentration
of
each
compound.
In
general,
we
chose
concentrations previously reported to extend median lifespan in
the C. elegans N2 strain.
We identified a similar pattern of variation in the compound
trials as we reported above for the baseline, non-intervention
studies (Table 2 and Supplementary Tables 2–3). That is to
say, partitioning variation among potential sources of error
using a GLM again established that little of the observed
variation was attributed to differences among labs and minor
variation due to combinations of lab-species, lab-strain and
lab-compound effects (0.1–0.5% of total variation attributed
to each). In contrast, we attributed 9.7% of the total variation
to reproducibility within each lab. For interventions however,
this
among-trial
variation
was
primarily
associated
with
plate-to-plate differences (possibly due to application of the
compounds to the plates, which is executed on a per plate basis).
Genetic differences and individual differences among animals
accounted for most of the variation in the intervention studies
(B44% each; Table 2). Genetic differences were proportionally
more important for the compound interventions than in the
baseline assays, probably because we intentionally sampled
strains covering a wide range of baseline longevities and, as
will be seen, treatment by many compounds tends to heighten
differences among strains. Overall, then, although the three labs
were able to create a high degree of reproducibility across
all longevity assays, most replication ‘error’ appears rooted in
trial-to-trial differences that impact the three lab outcomes
similarly. Collectively, our results indicate that for both chemical
and baseline lifespan assays, it is critical to assess the lifespans of
discrete cohorts in repeat studies, to capture the expected
biological variation.
ThT extended lifespan in a broad range of strains. Having
addressed the overall reproducibility in our experiments, we next
examined
compound-specific
effects
on
lifespan
extension.
We identified several compounds that had positive effects on
lifespan. However, depending on the compound, these effects
appeared to be differentially influenced by genetic background
(Supplementary Fig. 4). ThT was the most robust of the chemicals
we tested, as it significantly and reproducibly extended lifespan in

 five of the six strains tested, with only JU1348 failing to respond
to
treatment
with
significant
lifespan
extension
(Fig.
4a,
Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 4). In addition
to being the most robust of the treatments, ThT also showed
the most potent effect. We found that in some trials, for
certain strains, ThT-treated populations exhibited a doubling of
the median lifespan relative to control-treated populations
(Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 5). The average median lifespan
(across all the trials for a given strain) ranged from a small but
reproducible effect on HK104, the long-lived C. briggsae strain, to
a significantly large effect (70% extension of median lifespan) on
C. elegans strain MY16 (Fig. 4a). The potent and robust longevity
promoting effect that ThT exhibited on these Caenorhabditis
strains suggests that the molecular mechanism targeted by ThT is
a major determinant of lifespan that is conserved across divergent
genetic backgrounds.
DR mimetics exhibited similar strain specific responses. NP1 is
a synthetic compound, which we previously identified as pro-
moting lifespan in the N2 strain through a DR mechanism36. In
this study, we found that NP1 exhibited species- and strain-
specific effects on lifespan (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 6).
The C. elegans strains all showed significantly extended lifespan
when treated with NP1, relative to control-treated animals
(Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 4). On
average, NP1 caused a remarkably consistent and fairly potent
effect on lifespan across these strains (B30% longer median
lifespan relative to control treated populations), with the most
reproducible
effects
(among
the
strain
specific
replicates)
observed in the N2 strain and the most potent effects (across
all strain replicates) observed in the wild isolated strains (MY16
and JU775; Fig. 4b). The effect of NP1 on the lifespan of the C.
briggsae strains was more varied. NP1 did not have a significant

Figure 3 | Variation in longevity within labs for each replicate plate for eight natural isolates of C. briggsae. It is noteworthy that in many cases a given
natural isolate tends to display distinct patterns of responses under identical laboratory conditions rather than a continuous distribution of ‘error’ among
replicates. Among-replicate variation within each lab was a much larger barrier to reproducibility than variation in the average response of a strain across
labs (Table 2). Each plate was initiated with n ¼ 35 animals.

 of strain HK104 (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Figs 4 and 7, and
Supplementary Table 4). Although the trends observed were
the same for both chemicals, the magnitude of the effect on
lifespan from treatment with these chemicals was distinctly
different in two of the strains. aKG potently extended the lifespan
of the C. elegans strain MY16, with treated populations
commonly living 60% longer than control treated animals,
whereas its negative effect on the lifespan of strain HK104
was much weaker and less consistent than was observed for
NP1 (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Figs 4–7 and Supplementary
Table 4). Resveratrol has also been reported to promote
DR (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 8)21. Although there has
been considerable controversy surrounding resveratrol and
its proposed mechanism of action, most investigators studying
resveratrol effects on C. elegans lifespan have documented
small
but
significant
beneficial
effects
on
the
laboratory
standard N2 strain19,37. We also observed this effect and
further found that similar to NP1 and a-KG, resveratrol also
significantly extended the lifespan of the other C. elegans strains
tested. However, unlike NP1 and a-KG, we did not observe
any overall significant lifespan effect on any of the C. briggsae
strains treated with resveratrol compared to control treated
populations
(Fig.
4d,
Supplementary
Figs
4
and
8,
and
Supplementary Table 4). Overall, our work with candidate
DR mimetics suggests that there are promising benefits from
such pharmacological interventions, but at the same time
our data seem to indicate that these chemicals tend to exhibit
highly variable outcomes, dependent on the genetic background
of the treated subjects.
Compound that did not reproduce previous longevity out-
comes. In previous studies, three compounds that can exhibit
antioxidant properties (PG, a-LA and quercetin) extended the
lifespan of the standard laboratory strain N2 (refs 32,33).
We found that treatment with PG significantly, but relatively
weakly, extended the lifespan of diverse C. elegans strains relative
to control-treated populations. However, we did not observe
significant effects on the longevity of the C. briggsae strains
from treatment with PG (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Table 4).
Compared with the other treatments we assessed, this profile
appears most similar to the pattern observed in the resveratrol
treatments. a-LA-treated populations of the N2 strain exhibited a
small but significant lifespan extension relative to control-treated
populations. However, none of the wild strains exhibited a sig-
nificant lifespan response to a-LA (Fig. 4f and Supplementary
Table 4). Quercetin did not significantly extend the lifespan of
any strain tested (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Table 4). Overall,
there was little evidence that compounds with antioxidant
properties extended lifespan using the test conditions described
here, which might reflect the in vivo pleiotropy of reactive oxygen
species, which have been shown to act in pro-longevity signalling
cascades, in addition to exhibiting well-known negative impacts
on cellular systems38.
In our study, anticonvulsant drug VA (Fig. 4h) failed to extend
lifespan in any strain, an initial surprise, because VA has been
previously documented to extend lifespan of C. elegans strain
N2 in multiple replicate experiments35. Comparison of the CITP
treatment strategy with the published report suggests that
differences in outcomes may be due to use of distinctly
different treatment protocols (for example, we treated only
during adulthood, whereas Evason et al.35 treated the animals
from conception). Similarly, under our test conditions, aspirin
and curcumin (Fig. 4i,j) did not exert robust positive changes on
longevity across the test set. These differences from previously
published results may also reflect differences in test conditions.
Species-specific dosage responses. The most robust compounds
from our primary test were quite potent in the tested C. elegans
strains, yet other than ThT, these same compounds essentially
failed to exert positive effects in the C. briggsae strains. One
possibility we considered is that C. briggsae may exhibit distinctly
different dosage sensitivity than C. elegans. This hypothesis
seemed reasonable as the dosages tested were chosen based on
published reports of effectiveness in the C. elegans strain N2. To
further explore the chemical responsiveness of the C. briggsae
strains that failed to respond, we tested a range of doses for the
chemicals that were identified as positive in our initial tests.
Dose–response experiments with ThT indicated that in fact
ThT can have a positive impact on JU1348 but only at lower
dosages than we originally examined (Fig. 5a). As in the other
strains, the effective dose of ThT is relatively close to the
minimum toxic dose (see Discussion). In general, ThT was found
to be effective at extending lifespan across all genetic backgrounds
tested.
In contrast, the reported DR mimetics (NP1, aKG and
resveratrol), which each showed positive effects across the
C. elegans strains, resulted in distinct responses from the briggsae
species (Fig. 5b–d). For aKG and resveratrol, the three C. briggsae
strains all showed similar overall dose-dependent responses.
The C. briggsae strains treated with aKG did not clearly respond
with lifespan extension at doses in the micromolar range but did
exhibit shortened lifespan in the mid-millimolar range (Fig. 5b).
In contrast, we did not detect any clear response from the
C. briggsae strains treated with resveratrol (Fig. 5d). This lack of
response may indicate that the chemical is unavailable to the
animals, has low toxicity or that our dose range was too low to
observe an effect. The upper limit of our dose testing for
resveratrol was 1 mM, an order of magnitude higher than the
dose that exhibited positive effects on the C. elegans strains.
The C. briggsae strains treated with NP1 displayed more variable
responses. Both AF16 and JU1348 showed some indication of
a positive effect on lifespan from treatments with NP1 in the low
micromolar range, whereas in this same range HK104 exhibited
negative
effects.
The
shortening
of
lifespan

from
NP1 became more pronounced at mid- to high-micromolar
concentrations of NP1. We did not identify any dose of NP1 that

treatments is shown for six Caenorhabditis strains. The six strains consist of three C. elegans species (N2, MY16 and JU775, black text) and three C. briggsae
species (JU1348, AF16 and HK104, grey). The per cent difference in median lifespan was determined by calculating the median lifespan for each plate
population (single plate lifespan assays starting with 35–40 animals, each site at least 6 plates in at least 2 biological replicates). Every chemical test plate
had a control plate associated with it (diluent only control plate, that was maintained with the test plate), which contained animals from the same egg lay
and was always scored by the same technician as the test plate. In all graphs each point represents the percent difference in median lifespan between two
single plate populations, one containing the chemical being tested and the other containing the diluent control. Data incorporate censored animals in
calculating median lifespan. Points are colour coded to indicate the lab the data was collected in, as indicated in key on a. Middle bar represents the mean

 clearly extended the lifespan of HK104. We also tested PG, which
showed positive effects on the C. elegans strains, for dose-
dependent effects on the C. briggsae strains. PG showed a similar
profile as aKG, with no clear effect at low doses and negative
effects observed at low millimolar levels (Fig. 5e). Collectively,
these results suggest that the C. briggsae strains exhibit different
dosage specificities than C. elegans and further that some of these
chemicals have conserved effects, while others show species-
specific and strain-specific effects.
Discussion
Coupling the general challenge of reproducibility in ageing

natural isolates drawn from three genetically divergent species.

Figure 5 | Dosage effects on the lifespan C. briggsae with select positive chemicals. (a–c) Dose response effects on the median lifespan of select
C. briggsae strains after treatment with chemicals that exhibited strong positive effects on the C. elegans strains. Dosing was performed only on strains that
failed to respond positively in the initial tests (single dose experiments), as we did not attempt to identify peak responses, instead we only sought
to identify whether positive effects could be obtained by altering doses. Chemical doses were chosen to center around the effective dose identified for
C. elegans strains and were sometimes expanded after preliminary rounds of testing. ThT exhibited a positive effect on strain JU1348 at 25 mM, but was
profoundly toxic to all strains at and above 100 mM (a). NP1 exhibited a positive effect on AF16 and JU1348 at 10 mM relative to control treated populations
and showed reduced toxicity to HK104 at low micromolar concentrations (b). aKG did not exhibit clear positive effects in any of the C. briggsae strains
tested, but exhibited toxicity at high millimolar concentrations (c). None of the resveratrol doses assayed appeared to alter the median lifespan of any of the
C. briggsae strains tested (d). PG showed a negative effect on median lifespan for all of the C. briggsae strains tested at low millimolar concentrations (e).

and

responses.
Given
that
the
strict
coordination
of
experimental protocols among our labs limited between-lab
variability, our findings highlight the challenges of scientific
reproducibility with complex phenotypes such as longevity.
Overall, we find that for both natural ageing and ageing with
pharmacological interventions, repeated lifespan trials across
three labs under tightly controlled experimental conditions
yielded similar outcomes. At the same time, our results
highlight
that
factors
such
as
trial-to-trial
variation
and
inherently variable responses to interventions that may be
engrained in basic biology complicate efforts towards precise
reproducibility.
At the outset of this project we noted extensive differences
in details of media preparation, bacterial growth, animal handling
and experimental protocols when we compared working practices
among CITP labs. Although a fully ‘robust’ intervention might
withstand myriad protocol differences, we recognized that
interpretation of mixed or negative results would be clarified
only if we conducted experiments as similarly as possible.
By eliminating most systemic sources of variation, we anticipated
that we could focus on genetic diversity and other sources
of variability during data analysis. Consideration of the numbers
of reagents, protocols and human behaviour involved led to
the appreciation of the complexity of options for executing any
given
experiment.
As
precise
replication
and
adherence
to protocol is likely to be required, to fully reproduce studies
across labs, we defined a set of experimental protocols that
were rigorously followed at all sites41. Although we were able
to successfully eliminate among-lab variation in outcomes for
the CITP, we did not systematically test each variable in our
studies for impact on variation. We do not therefore suggest
that
the
protocols
we
followed
were
the
best
possible
practices; instead, we focused on strict execution of similar
experimental details at all sites. Importantly, our documentation
of relatively high variability in lifespan results across biological
replicates independent of the lab conducting the experiment
should be taken into account when one assesses the effects of
chemicals or genetic backgrounds on lifespan. Our study indicates
that even when following the same methods, insufficient
replication of trials could account for failures to reproduce
previous studies.
Our focus on rigorously adhering to defined methods to reduce
variability between sites necessitated making choices about
specific methodologies for which there was no standard across
the field. In particular, these related to the use and dosage of
FUdR, use of live bacteria and the method of chemical delivery,
all of which have previously been found to be confounding factors
in lifespan studies42–46. We specifically chose to use relatively low
doses of FUdR, live bacteria cultures, added chemicals directly to
culture plates only after bacteria had grown to saturation and
only exposed adult animals to chemicals. These methods were
mainly chosen to promote throughput and help mitigate possible
effects of chemicals on bacterial growth and density. We also note
that rigorous adherence to specific methodologies across a
scientific field could limit serendipitous findings related to
varying those conditions. In this study, it is possible that these
selections resulted in discrepancies of methodology between ours
and previously published studies. These differences may have
contributed to our failure to reproduce several previously
reported effects. Specifically, we did not observe previously
reported lifespan extension of the standard laboratory strain N2
when treated with quercetin, VA, aspirin or curcumin29,31,33,35.
Further investigation would be required to determine whether
procedural differences are responsible for a given failure to
replicate
previous
studies
and/or
whether
these
particular
compounds are particularly sensitive to specific experimental
circumstances.
The comparative life history analysis of our 22 wild strains
revealed interesting features. We found that both a-time and
fertility were remarkably similar for organisms collected over
a wide geographical area. This consistency may indicate that
selective pressure for fast growth and high fertility is shared
across the strains. We found the variation for adult survival to be
much higher than variation for self-fertility. Increased variation
in the longevity measure within the Caenorhabditis genus is
consistent with the idea that normal ageing processes are not
under selective pressure and therefore more likely to drift
randomly.
We found that multiple C. briggsae strains exhibited a striking
bimodal survival outcome in all three labs. For example, a total of
25 survival assays were undertaken on HK104 across the three
labs. We observed that 13 cohorts were relatively short-lived and
12 cohorts were long-lived. We observed this bimodality in
almost all C. briggsae strains to some degree. The bimodal pattern
appears to be a systematic source of within-lab variance intrinsic
to the system. Strong evidence supports that even single-celled
organisms can adopt distinct physiological states47. Our findings
raise the question as to whether C. briggsae might have the
capacity to transit through distinct physiological states according
to unidentified cues. The Caenorhabditis capacity to adopt
distinct physiological states could also account for some of the
reported heterogeneity in behaviours and phenotypes.
A core premise of the CITP is that compounds that extend
lifespan across genetically diverse organisms are strong candi-
dates for further testing and mechanistic dissection in multiple
models, and eventually humans. Indeed, among a small initial
compound test set, we found that ThT extended lifespan in all of
the six strains tested. ThT is a well-known laboratory reagent,
commonly used as a histological stain for protein aggregates and
in particular amyloids. ThT has previously been shown to
suppress the aggregation and toxicity associated with the
expression of a human neurotoxic peptide (Ab3-41) and promotes
protein homeostasis in a range of protein homeostasis models in
C. elegans strain N2. Furthermore, the in vivo effect on lifespan
has been associated with a wide range of gene expression changes
impacting proteostatic functions including molecular chaperones,
autophagy and the proteasome31. Collectively, these findings have
been interpreted as indicating that ThT promotes lifespan by
improving protein homeostasis31. Whether or not enhanced
protein homeostasis is indeed the operative mechanism causative
for the ThT effect on lifespan extension, our results suggest that
ThT acts through a general longevity mechanism conserved
across highly divergent Caenorhabditis strains, worthy of focused
attention for intervention strategies. However, it seems that such
research will ultimately need to be directed towards identifying
less toxic derivatives of ThT or structurally unique compounds
that target the same pathways as ThT, as we observed toxicity
from ThT in addition to robust and profound lifespan extension.
Our enthusiasm for ThT as a direct candidate for pre-clinical
studies was somewhat diminished by observations of this
hormetic dose response (Fig. 5a). Among all the chemicals tested
for dose responses in C. briggsae, ThT was the most toxic, killing
off JU1348 rapidly when administered in the mid-micromolar
range (Fig. 5). Interestingly, we found that the low micromolar
doses at which ThT was effective in promoting lifespan was quite
close to the dose at which it was toxic (Fig. 5a). We had
previously observed a similar dose response profile for the lab
adapted N2 strain31 and this phenomenon also fits in well with
our observations that cohorts treated with ThT sometimes
suffered high early life mortality with the survivors exhibiting
low mortality in late life (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5). Despite

 these observations, we do not favour a mechanistic model of
ThT activity as strictly hormetic (beneficial effect arising from
low-dose administration of a toxin). It is important to note that,
although low doses of toxins can sometimes have beneficial
effects
on
lifespan
through
unclear
and
perhaps
myriad
mechanisms
(including
upregulation
of
stress
response
pathways), this is not always the case48–51. The magnitude of
the ThT effect on lifespan appears to exceed previously reported
examples of such chemically induced phenomenon in C. elegans.
However, without an understanding of the molecular targets we
cannot rule out indirect upregulation of stress response pathways
as causative for the observed ThT lifespan extension. It will be
interesting to determine whether the lifespan extending effects
and toxicity of ThT can be separated. If the two phenomena are
found to be inseparably linked, perhaps future research can
identify less potent compounds that target the same pathways,
such that even at high doses they only reach the effects of the
low micromolar ThT treatments.
In our initial experiments we found that several positive acting
chemicals (NP1, aKG, resveratrol and PG) exhibited positive
lifespan effects on the C. elegans strains, but not on the C. briggsae
strains, revealing species-specific outcomes. Our dose–response
assays with these chemicals suggest that in fact some of these
chemicals can be effective in the C. briggsae strains, albeit at lower
doses (Fig. 5). This result indicates that although species-specific
interactions are apparently present, a major issue for research
comparing chemical treatments across species is identifying
the different dosing requirements that arise from distinct
chemical sensitivities. Layering dosage-specific effects on top of
the demands of replication across multiple genetic backgrounds
rapidly increases the scale of studies needed to examine the
effectiveness of individual compounds, yet this is a core
component of the recent push towards personalized or precision
medicine52.
It is noteworthy that treatment with two chemicals, reported to
activate DR (NP1 and aKG), resulted in strikingly similar strain
response profiles, including extended lifespan in the C. elegans
strains but shortened lifespan in the C. briggsae strain HK104
(Fig. 4b,c). This phenomena might shed light on a similar
phenomenon observed in diverse mouse strains, in which lifespan
can be either extended or reduced by DR, and underscores that
metabolic interventions that engage DR might be particularly
sensitive to genetic background53. HK104 might have its native
metabolism set close to or in DR, such that the NP1 intervention
pushes the strain closer to the starvation/deleterious level of
DR54. Alternatively, distinct bioavailability properties in these
strains might underlie this differential outcome (for example,
HK104 may accumulate NP1 to toxic levels). Although more
DR mimetic interventions need to be tested before strong
conclusions
can
be
drawn,
our
observations
suggest
that
particular intervention response profiles across the CITP strain
test set may eventually be informative on mechanisms of
compound action.
Here we have described a multi-site Caenorhabditis longevity
study conducted with attention to tightly replicating experimental
conditions, an approach that enabled us to define sources
of variation in survival analyses that provided a powerful
assessment of our experimental reproducibility. We documented
the presence of relatively high variability (B10%) in lifespan
results among biological replicates (trials) and demonstrate that
this was independent of the lab, person or the site running
the experiment. This demonstrated that previously anecdotal
observations of variation in lifespan outcomes in fact occurs and
exists for multiple species of the Caenorhabditis genre, even under
tightly controlled experimental conditions. Such variation may be
a general characteristic of ageing studies across species and
highlights the importance of conducting
highly replicated
experiments, which is a core element of the CITP approach.
Another major feature of the CITP is the use of genetic variation
within and between species as a probe for examining the
robustness of longevity-enhancing effects of specific compounds.
Indeed, we find genetic variation to be very important for some
compounds,
whereas
other
compounds
are
robust
across
labs, replicates and genetic backgrounds. Given our collective
long-term goal of identifying interventions effective in improving
human health and longevity, these latter types of compounds
seem
particularly
promising
leads
for
further
testing
in
vertebrates.
Methods
Organism cultures and strains. Caenorhabditis cultures were grown and
maintained essentially as previously described55. All worm cultures were
maintained at 20 �C with 80% humidity in Biological Incubator Model I-36NL
(Percival Scientific). We used an agar concentration of 23 g l � 1 in nematode
growth media (NGM) plates to reduce worm burrowing. The streptomycin-
resistant bacteria strain OP50-1 was used as the nematode food source.
Streptomycin was only used in bacteria-specific cultures and not in NGM plates.
Detailed standard operating procedures and the same reagents were used
at each site to ensure uniformity of culture practices41. Standard operating
procedures covered (among other things) plate and drug preparations, periodic
thaw schedules of fresh organism stocks (from frozen stocks prepared and
distributed from a single lab) and the disallowance (from assays) of worm
populations that had experienced starvation, contamination or thawing within
three generations. Technicians were not blinded to the strains and conditions
during any of the experiments reported in this manuscript.
The 22 nematode strains were selected from three hermaphroditic species
of Caenorhabditis: C. elegans (CB4856, ED3040, JU1088, JU1652, JU775, MY16,
N2 and QX1211), C. briggsae (AF16, ED3092, HK104, JU1264, JU1348, JU726,
NIC20 and QR25) and C. tropicalis (JU1373, JU1630, NIC122, NIC58, QG131
and QG834).
Developmental time assay. The average developmental time for each strain was
determined by scoring the time interval between when an egg was laid, until its
development into an egg laying adult (a-time). Specifically, 1 h egg lays were
performed with 50 first-day adults. Twenty to 25 of the resulting eggs were
separated onto individual plates and observed hourly for the time of the first
appearance of eggs. Reported a-times were the interval of time that had passed
from the midpoint time of the egg lay until the observation of the first eggs,
averaged from a minimum of 20 individual worms.
Fertility assay. The average self-fertility of each strain was determined by scoring
the number of hatched offspring from individual animals. Specifically, 50 gravid
adults were allowed to lay eggs for 1 h and were then removed from the plate. Two
days later, 20 of the resulting fourth larval stage animals were separated onto
individual plates. These were moved onto fresh plates every day until egg laying
ceased. Two days after egg laying animals were removed, the plates were scored for
the number of worms present. The fertility number reported was the average from
20 scored individual worms.
Lifespan assays. Synchronous populations were obtained by 1–3 h egg lays
with first-day adults, after which the adults were removed and the eggs were left to
develop into adults. For strains with a significant incidence of males, late larval
stage worms were moved a day before the egg lay, to insure they were unmated. On
their first day of adulthood, the synchronous population was moved onto 35 mm
NGM assay plates (3 ml NGM agar with 51 mM FUdR to inhibit reproduction). For
each condition tested in the lifespan assay, 35–40 worms were placed on each of at
least 3 individual plates (referred to as technical replicates) and was considered a
single trial (biological replicate).
Chemical preparation and drugging procedures. Chemical solutions were
prepared by dissolving solid chemicals in either sterile water or dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO). For chemicals with water as the solvent, stock solutions were also the
working solutions. To drug assay plates, 125 ml of the working solution was added
to the top of a 3 ml assay plate. For chemicals with DMSO as the solvent, working
solutions were made up from stock solutions and contained 7.5 ml of stock solution
for every 125 ml of sterile water. Working solution (132.5 ml) was then added to the
top of the plate (final DMSO concentration of 0.25%). Chemicals that precipitated
at working solution concentrations were prepared individually from stock solutions
(DMSO as solvent) for each plate. Specifically, for each assay plate 7.5 ml of stock
solution was placed into a 250 ml tube, to which 125 ml of sterile water was added,
the resulting slurry was then dispensed to an assay plate. Chemical solutions were

 added to plates already containing a ‘lawn’ of bacteria in stationary phase. Solutions
were distributed over the entire plate surface and allowed to dry in a sterile
hood until the surface was devoid of liquid. These were then allowed to sit for
24 h at 20 �C before use or before moving into 4 �C storage for up to 3 weeks.
Data center. Data in the form of observations was generally recorded during
scoring with tablet computers running Filemaker Go (Filemaker Inc.) and was
thereby entered into a consolidated Filemaker Database (our Data Center) through
a dedicated physical server hosted at the Buck Institute. Unique account IDs were
used to facilitate all sites ability to access the entire data, while simultaneously
restricting the editing abilities of each site to the data they deposited into the
database.
Statistical analysis. Our overall goals for the analysis of longevity were to
(1) partition variation among a wide variety of possible causal sources (for example,
genetic differences and experimental ‘error’) and (2) test for the effects of
compound interventions on individual longevity. These goals required
a mix-model approach in which ‘variance-generating’ factors were treated as
random effects and compounds were treated as fixed effects. To accomplish this we
analysed longevity using both GLMs using the lme4 v.1.12 package and a mixed-
model Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model56 using the coxme v.2.2-5 package57
in the R statistical language58. Individuals that were lost from the experiment and
not directly observed to be dead on a given date were marked as ‘censored’.
Censored individuals were retained within the full likelihood framework of the
CPH but were excluded from GLM analyses. As we observed a significant
association between mean lifespan and its variance across replicate plates
(linear regression R2 ¼ 0.19, F1,727 ¼ 170.58, Po0.0001), we log-transformed the
age-at-death data after excluding any censored values for any GLM analysis
involving multiple strains. This transformation greatly increased homoscedasticity
and reduced the association between mean and variance in longevity
(linear regression R2 ¼ 0.01, F1,727 ¼ 8.37, P ¼ 0.0039). Longevities within trials are
approximately normal, but frequently not precisely so. However, analysis of
variance approaches tend to be robust to departures from normality, especially
when homoscedasticity can be achieved59. We also analysed the global variance
component models using a variety of other error distributions (for example,
Poisson; see Supplementary Softwares 1 and 2 for the R-scripts and Supplementary
Data 11 and 12 for the outputs from the full statistical analyses). We also provide
the results for the analysis on the untransformed scale in the Supplementary
Tables. When measured as a relative fraction of the total estimated variance
provided for a given distribution, none of the variance component estimates were
materially affected by any of these different analyses and all results are qualitatively
similar and in close quantitative agreement.
For the analysis of data in the absence of a compound intervention
(‘baseline treatments’), laboratory, species, strain, experimenter, trial and plate were
taken as the main effects, with strain nested within species. Possible interactions
between laboratory–species and laboratory–strain were also included in the model.
The other factors were treated as a randomized-block design, with experimenter
nested within lab, trial nested within experimenter and plate nested within trial.
As we sought to partition the total variance for lifespan among all potential sources,
for the baseline treatments all factors were treated as random effects and their
associated variance components were estimated using a restricted maximum
likelihood approach using lme4. Current implementations of the mixed-model
CPH do not allow complex models involving interactions among different
sets of nested factors and thus that approach could not be used in any of our multi-
strain analyses.
For the analysis of lifespans involving compound treatments, the above
modelling approach was used with compound as an additional fixed factor in
each model. Interactions involving compound and species, strain and laboratory
(that is, factors not part of the randomized block design) were also included as
random effects in the model. For the global partitioning of variation, we again used
a restricted maximum likelihood GLM to partition total variation among all
possible non-fixed sources. To test for the effects of individual compounds, we used
CPH analysis within each strain so that each compound treatment replicate could
be matched with their appropriate replicate-specific control in the randomized
blocks design. The CPH analysis was supported by GLM analysis of the same
model. Here, the random effects model included lab, experimenter within lab, trial
within experimenter and plate within trial for both the GLM and CPH. Compound
effects were tested as a planned comparison between the responses of individuals
raised on the compound in question and those raised on the appropriate carrier
control (H2O or DMSO). Results from the two methods of analysis were entirely
concordant with one another; thus, we present a summary of CPH results in the
figures and the full results for both analyses in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4.
Using our per-strain estimates of sampling variance, we expect to have power 40.9
to detect a compound effect of at least 10% within each trial within each lab.
For the analysis of the timing of reproductive development (a-time), we
found a strong relationship between the mean and variance of time to first egg lay
(measured in hours) among replicates (linear regression R2 ¼ 0.17, F1,119 ¼ 23.42,
Po0.0001). Analysing this trait as a developmental rate (1/a-time) stabilized
the variances and eliminated this relationship (linear regression R2 ¼ 0.01,
F1,119 ¼ 1.08, P ¼ 0.3009), and we therefore used developmental rate as the focal
trait for our analysis of variance. We detected no significant relationship between
mean and variance for lifetime fertility among replicates (linear regression
R2 ¼ 0.01, F1,98 ¼ 1.08, Po0.3012), and so that trait was analysed on the original
scale. As with longevity, we partitioned potential sources of variation for
developmental rate and fertility using a GLM including the same causal factors.
Unlike longevity, however, there is no plate effect in the model because each
individual was raised on their own plate. Further, these assays were not as
extensively replicated as the longevity trials; thus, the effects of individual
experimenters are subsumed into the general laboratory factor in the partitioning
of variation. C. elegans strain QX1211 displayed extraordinarily low levels of
fertility, probably as a result of the ‘mortal germline’ phenotype60 and thus was
excluded from the variance component analysis for this trait.
