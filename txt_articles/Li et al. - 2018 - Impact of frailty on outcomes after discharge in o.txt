eadmissions are expensive,1 have been considered an 
important quality indicator for surgical care2 and are 
highest after abdominal procedures.1 Older patients are 
increasingly being admitted with acute surgical conditions3 and 
have a higher risk of readmission.4
Frailty is more prevalent among, although it is not limited to, 
older patients.5 It is widely accepted that frailty is a multifactorial 
state that is marked by vulnerability to internal and external 
stress6 and that may change over time.6,7 Frailty is a known risk 
factor for complications,8–11 prolonged hospital stay8,12 and 
adverse discharge disposition.8,11 Furthermore, degree of frailty 
shows a dose–response relation to mortality in both surgical13 
and critically ill5 patients. However, the impact of frailty on read-
mission after surgery in older patients has rarely been assessed.
Measuring frailty in hospital using a rapid tool may be espe-
cially valuable for surgeons who treat older patients whose risk 
of poor outcomes is not captured by their age alone.6,14 Perhaps 
the greatest opportunity lies in increasing recognition of patients 
who are at high risk without noticeable disability, which could 
enable early intervention.6 The Canadian Study of Health and 
Aging Clinical Frailty Scale15 is a previously validated 9-point 
global subjective assessment of comorbidity and function that 
does not require specialized training or entail extensive assess-
ment;16 it has surpassed more complex frailty assessments in 
predicting readmission and mortality.17,18 
Very few studies have examined the risk associated with 
frailty for subsequent health care utilization in any surgical 
group.18 Therefore, we assessed the impact of preadmission 
frailty on 30-day and 6-month readmission or death in older 
patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Frailty is a state of vulner-
ability to diverse stressors. We assessed 
the impact of frailty on outcomes after 
discharge in older surgical patients.
METHODS: We prospectively followed 
patients 65 years of age or older who 
underwent emergency abdominal surgery 
at either of 2 tertiary care centres and who 
needed assistance with fewer than 3 activ-
ities of daily living. Preadmission frailty 
was defined according to the Canadian 
Study of Health and Aging Clinical Frailty 
Scale as “well” (score 1 or 2), “vulnerable” 
(score 3 or 4) or “frail” (score 5 or 6). We 
assessed composite end points of 30-day 
and 6-month all-cause readmission or 
death by multivariable logistic regression. 
RESULTS: Of 308 patients (median age 75 
[range 65–94] yr, median Clinical Frailty 
Score 3 [range 1–6]), 168 (54.5%) were 
classified as vulnerable and 68 (22.1%) as 
frail. Ten (4.2%) of those classified as vul-
nerable or frail received a geriatric con-
sultation. At 30 days after discharge, the 
proportions of patients who were read-
mitted or had died were greater among 
vulnerable patients (n = 27 [16.1%]; 
adjusted odds ratio [OR] 4.60, 95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 1.29–16.45) and frail 
patients (n = 12 [17.6%]; adjusted OR 
4.51, 95% CI 1.13–17.94) than among 
patients who were well (n = 3 [4.2%]). By 
6 months, the degree of frailty indepen-
dently and dose-dependently predicted 
readmission or death: 56 (33.3%) of the 
vulnerable patients (adjusted OR 2.15, 
95% CI 1.01–4.55) and 37 (54.4%) of the 
frail patients (adjusted OR 3.27, 95% CI 
1.32–8.12) were readmitted or had died, 
compared with 11 (15.3%) of the patients 
who were well. 
INTERPRETATION: Vulnerability and 
frailty were prevalent in older patients 
undergoing surgery and unlikely to trig-
ger specialized geriatric assessment, yet 
remained independently associated with 
greater risk of readmission for as long as 
6 months after discharge. Therefore, the 
degree of frailty has important prognos-
tic value for readmission. Trial registra-

Methods
Population and data collection
We report here a substudy of patients who were prospectively 
enrolled during the pre-implementation phase of the Elder-
friendly Approaches to the Surgical Environment (EASE) study 
(clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02233153).19 We included 
patients aged 65 years or older who survived emergency abdom-
inal surgery at 2 tertiary care hospitals in Canada (University of 
Alberta Hospital, Edmonton, and Foothills Medical Centre, Cal-
gary) between January 2014 and September 2015. Patients who 
required assistance with 3 or more activities of daily living, 
underwent palliative or trauma surgery, or were transferred from 
another ward or hospital were excluded. Baseline and demo-
graphic characteristics were collected by trained research assis-
tants through chart review and patient interviews in the hospital 
or at follow-up. We calculated the Charlson Comorbidity Index 
for each patient; this index has previously been validated for 
acutely ill older patients.20
Main independent variable
We assessed frailty using the revised Canadian Study of Health 
and Aging Clinical Frailty Scale.15 Trained research assistants 
determined frailty status in the 2 weeks preceding index admis-
sion by interviewing patients (or their surrogates) shortly after 
admission or by reviewing medical charts. Degree of frailty was 
defined as very fit to well (termed “well,” for brevity; score 1 or 
2), managing well to vulnerable (termed “vulnerable;” score 3 or 
4) or mildly to moderately frail (termed “frail;” score 5 or 6). “Very 
fit” refers to people who are very active and energetic; “well” 
indicates those who are occasionally active; “managing well” 
indicates those who are physically inactive beyond routine walk-
ing; “vulnerable” indicates those with comorbidity and limited 
activity, but without disability; “mild frailty” indicates depen-
dence in 1 or more instrumental activities of daily living (e.g., 
food preparation or housework); and “moderate frailty” indi-
cates dependence in 1 or 2 basic activities of daily living (e.g., 
dressing, bathing).16 Patients with severe or very severe frailty, 
indicating complete dependence in 3 or more activities of daily 
living, and terminally ill patients (score ≥ 7) were ineligible for 
the EASE study.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was composite all-cause readmission or 
death at 30 days and 6 months after discharge, which accounts 
for the competing risk of death. Readmission and mortality data 
were collected from a province-wide electronic medical records 
database. Readmission was defined as acute care admission 
after the initial surgery, excluding transfers for rehabilitation or 
convalescence.
Statistical analysis
We determined descriptive statistics, calculating proportions, 
means and medians. We identified some potential confounders 
a priori on the basis of existing literature and clinical importance 
(age, sex and type of surgery). Additional potential confounders 
were identified in univariable analyses that compared baseline 
covariables with readmission or death and with frailty, with a 
predefined cut-off of p < 0.2. We used Fisher exact tests for 
categorical variables and t tests or one-way analysis of variance 
for continuous variables (see Table 1 for the variables included). 
Trends for covariables and degree of frailty are reported.
We then developed multivariable logistic regression models 
using a standard approach21 to calculate the odds of readmission 
or death. Patients who were readmitted or who died were consid-
ered to have had an event and were included in the numerator to 
account for the competing risk of death. Age, sex and type of sur-
gery were forced into all models. Identified potential confounders 
were then sequentially entered into the model and retained if 
they met statistical criteria for confounding (potential confounder 
p < 0.1 or > 10% change in the frailty β-coefficient upon inclusion). 
We chose the most parsimonious models, allowing as many as 
6 variables at 30 days and 7 variables at 6 months. Model fit was 
judged using the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, and 
accuracy was judged using the C statistic. We conducted sensitiv-
ity analyses to assess the relation of interest per 1-point increase 
in the Clinical Frailty Scale and the additional prognostic value of 
increasing age and American Society of Anesthesiologists classifi-
cation (https://www.asahq.org/resources/clinical-information/
asa-physical-status-classification-system). We also conducted a 
post hoc sensitivity analysis excluding patients who underwent 
cancer surgery. We considered the Clinical Frailty Scale as a 
dichotomized variable, applying a well-balanced cut-off score of 
4 (rather than 5, as used previously5,22,23), because our cohort 
excluded patients with scores of 7 or higher. Finally, we disaggre-
gated composite outcomes to identify whether readmission or 
death was driving the relation. 
Statistical significance was defined on the basis of 2-tailed 
p < 0.05. All analyses were conducted with Stata 14 software 
(StataCorp LP).
Ethics approval
The University of Alberta Research Ethics Board (Pro00047180) 
and the University of Calgary Research Ethics Board (REB140729) 
approved the study procedures. 
Results
Of 3506 patients screened, most were excluded because of age 
younger than 65, conservative management or transfer (Figure 1). 
We enrolled 322 patients and retrieved readmission or mortality 
data for all patients. Fourteen of the patients died before dis-
charge and were thus excluded from the analyses (Figure 1).
Cohort characteristics
The median age was 75 (range 65–94) years, and 140 (45.4%) of 
the 308 patients were women. The median score on the Clinical 
Frailty Scale was 3 (range 1–6): 15 (4.9%) of the patients were 
“very fit” (score = 1), 57 (18.5%) were “well” (score = 2), 108 
(35.1%) were “managing well” (score = 3), 60 (19.5%) were “vul-
nerable” (score = 4), 39 (12.7%) had “mild frailty” (score = 5), and 
29 (9.4%) had “moderate frailty” (score = 6). Before the index

admission, 228 (74.0%) of the patients had been living at home 
independently, 62 (20.1%) had been living at home with assis-
tance, 16 (5.2%) had been residing in a nursing home, and 2 
(0.6%) had other living arrangements. The mean Charlson 
Comorbidity Index was 1.1 (standard deviation 1.2), and nearly 
all (292 [94.8%]) of the patients underwent a single surgery dur-
ing their admission; 14 patients (4.5%) required a second sur-
gery, and 2 (0.6%) required more than 2 procedures. Patients 
underwent the following types of surgery: 109 (35.4%) had chole-
cystectomy or appendectomy, 87 (28.2%) had small intestinal 
surgery, 43 (14.0%) had colon surgery, 42 (13.6%) had hernia 
repair, and 27 (8.8%) had some other type of abdominal surgery.
Prevalence and degree of frailty
Seventy-two (23.4%) of the patients were classified as well (score 1 
or 2), 168 (54.5%) as vulnerable (score 3 or 4), and 68 (22.1%) as 
frail (score 5 or 6) (Table 1). The patients classified as vulnerable or 
frail were older, had a higher number of comorbidities and medi-
cations, and more often presented with abnormal serum hemoglo-
bin and creatinine levels than patients classified as well (Table 1). 
At surgery, patients classified as frail were more likely than 
those classified as well or vulnerable to undergo a laparoscopic 
(closed) approach for cholecystectomy or appendectomy; if they 
had intestinal surgery, they were more likely to receive an ostomy 
(Table 1). Patients classified as vulnerable or frail scored a median 
of 3 on the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification 
(interquartile range [IQR] 2–3 and 3–4, respectively), compared 
with 2 (IQR 2–3) for patients classified as well (Table 1). Although 
the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification was sta-
tistically different for different levels of frailty, the median and 
mode were the same for patients classified as vulnerable or frail 
(data not shown). Patients classified as frail were more likely to 
require postoperative intensive care or close observation and to 
stay in hospital longer and were less likely to be discharged 
home independently (Table 1). Although patients classified as 
vulnerable or frail more often underwent a geriatric assessment 
than patients classified as well, overall only 4.2% (10/236) of the 
former group were assessed by a geriatrician. 
Thirty-day readmission or death
Within 30 days after discharge, 42 (13.6%) of the patients were 
readmitted or had died. These outcomes occurred in 27 (16.1%) of 
those classified as vulnerable and 12 (17.6%) of those classified as 
frail, but only 3 (4.2%) of those classified as well (p = 0.02; Figure 2, 
Table 2). After adjustment for age, sex, type of surgery, abnormal 
hemoglobin level and postoperative use of total parenteral nutri-
tion, vulnerable status remained associated with 30-day readmis-
sion or death (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 4.60, 95% confidence inter-
val [CI] 1.29–16.45), as did frail status (adjusted OR 4.51, 95% CI 
1.13–17.94; C statistic 0.75, 95% CI 0.67–0.83) (Table 2).
Six-month readmission or death
By 6 months after discharge, 104 (33.8%) of the patients were 
readmitted or had died. These outcomes occurred in 56 (33.3%) 
of those classified as vulnerable and 37 (54.4%) of those classi-
fied as frail, but only 11 (15.3%) of those classified as well (p < 
0.001; Figure 2, Table 2). After adjustment for age, sex, type of 
surgery, abnormal hemoglobin level, Charlson Comorbidity 
Index and intraoperative ostomy creation, degree of frailty pre-
dicted 6-month re

95% CI 1.32–8.12; C statistic 0.75, 95% CI 0.69–0.81; Table 2).
Sensitivity analyses
A 1-point increase in the Clinical Frailty Scale predicted a greater 
risk of readmission or death, both independently (at 30 d, adjusted 
OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.03–1.77, C statistic 0.74, 95% CI 0.66–0.81; at 
6 mo, adjusted OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.11–1.75, C statistic 0.75, 95% CI 
0.69–0.81) and without adjustment (at 30 d, crude C statistic 0.65, 
95% CI 0.56–0.73; at 6 mo, crude C statistic 0.68, 95% CI 0.62–0.74). 
Neither increasing age (at 30 d, adjusted OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.47–1.23; 
at 6 mo, adjusted OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.68–1.40) nor a 1-point increase 
in the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification (at 30 d, 
adjusted OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.69–1.98; at 6 mo, adjusted OR 1.00, 95% 
CI 0.67–1.49) was associated with readmission or death. A post hoc 
sensitivity analysis that excluded patients who underwent cancer 
surgery (n = 22, 7.1%) did not change the positive association 
between frailty and readmission or death at 30 days or at 6 months 
(data not shown). Applying a Clinical Frailty Scale cut-off score of 4 
yielded similar results to the tertile analyses (at 30 d, adjusted OR 
2.42, 95% CI 1.16–5.02; at 6 mo, adjusted OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.25–
3.92). Additional models were adjusted for the same confounders 
included in the final models above. With disaggregation of com-
posite outcomes, we found that readmissions drove the observed 
associations (Table 2). Patients were most commonly readmitted 
for gastrointestinal problems, infection or pulmonary disease (at 
30 d, 15/40 [37.5%], 8/40 [20.0%] and 5/40 [12.5%], respectively; at 
6 mo, 32/99 [32.3%], 19/99 [19.2%] and 11/99 [11.1%], respec-
tively). No patients classified as well had died by 6 months after 
discharge.
Interpretation
This study had 3 main findings. First, one-third of older patients 
were readmitted or died within 6 months after discharge follow-
ing surgery. Second, patients classified as vulnerable or frail were 
at increased risk of 30-day readmission or death. Third, by 
6 months, the degree of frailty predicted, in a dose-dependent 
manner, increased risk of readmission or death after multivari-
able adjustment.
Our findings support and expand evidence concerning frailty 
and readmission. Of 25 studies on frailty assessment for prognosis

‡For the 30-day model, the following variables met the statistical criteria for confounding: hemoglobin level on 
admission, postoperative recovery on ward, postoperative use of total parenteral nutrition and Charlson Comorbidity 
Index. The final 30-day model was adjusted for age, sex, type of surgery, hemoglobin level on admission and 
postoperative use of total parenteral nutrition.
§For the 6-month model, the following variables met the statistical criteria for confounding: creatinine and hemoglobin 
levels on admission, postoperative use of total parenteral nutrition, intraoperative ostomy creation and Charlson 
Comorbidity Index. The final 6-month model was adjusted for age, sex, type of surgery, hemoglobin level on admission, 
intraoperative ostomy creation and the Charlson Comorbidity Index.

after cardiac surgery, only 2 used the Clinical Frailty Scale, and 
none used the scale to predict readmission.13 The handful of 
prior studies conducted in a surgical setting largely reported 
adverse prognosis for patients with frailty, but were mostly 
restricted to specific procedures and short follow-up periods.23–27 
Very few studies have assessed a dose–response relation. Among 
325 older patients who underwent general surgery, no difference 
was found in unadjusted 30-day readmission rates between frail 
and nonfrail patients, where frailty was defined by Clinical Frailty 
Scale scores of 5 or higher.23 However, in 383 adult kidney trans-
plant recipients, frailty classified by the Fried criteria identified a 
60% increased risk of 30-day readmission.24 Furthermore, in a 
retrospective study of 5627 adults who underwent posterior cer-
vical fusion, each additional point on a frailty-based index con-
ferred a 40% increased risk of 30-day readmission,25 similar to 
the 35% increase in risk per additional point in the Clinical Frailty 
Scale observed in our study. For 178 older patients with colorec-
tal cancer, frailty on comprehensive geriatric assessment was 
associated with 2.5 times higher unadjusted risk of 30-day read-
mission related to colorectal surgery.26 Similarly, after classifica-
tion of 72 older patients undergoing colorectal surgery on the 
basis of 7 frailty traits, 30-day readmission rates rose with 
increasing frailty from 6% to 29%.27 Among nonsurgical patients, 
a Clinical Frailty Scale score of 5 or higher independently pre-
dicted a threefold risk of 30-day readmission or death among 
245 older medical patients17 and a twofold risk of 1-year readmis-
sion among 421 critically ill older patients.5
In this study, we overcame several limitations of prior studies 
by enrolling an older but largely unselected surgical cohort and 
reporting outcomes that occurred as long as 6 months after dis-
charge. We also carefully assessed confounders, adjusting a pri-
ori for age, sex and type of surgery (because these factors have 
been linked to frailty and readmission) and examining a range of 
demographic, biological and clinical factors. Moreover, by 
describing the dose–response relation between degree of frailty 
and readmission rates, we provide evidence of risk in patients 
admitted without noticeable disability who had lower Clinical 
Frailty Scale scores. Although our cohort was relatively small 
compared with potential nonsurgical or all-aged groups, the 
patients were admitted to hospital for a wide range of abdominal 
diseases, which supports the importance of frailty in predicting 
readmission risk in various illnesses. Thus, the results may be rel-
evant for clinicians or researchers concerned with prognosis in 
older patients in general.
Several mechanisms may explain the observed relation. 
Adverse outcomes could result from environmental or behav-
ioural factors, particularly if extreme vulnerability to stressors 
like surgery28 increases the time of return to physiologic baseline, 
thereby predisposing frail patients to functional decline29 and 
reduced self-care capacity.30,31 Social factors may also modulate 
the adverse effects of frailty, whereby patients of lower socioeco-
nomic status are both more likely to be classified as frail and 
more likely to be readmitted to hospital.32 Additionally, the 
inflammatory state associated with postoperative healing may 
exacerbate the already impaired immune system of frail older 
patients,33 thereby increasing postoperative infection rates34 or 
worsening comorbid conditions, leading to readmission. Alterna-
tively, residual confounding may account for some of the risk 
observed; however, we adjusted for a variety of clinical and bio-
logic markers, as did multiple prior studies of mortality.13,24,25
Limitations
Although this study featured two-centre prospective enrolment, 
extensive data collection and prolonged follow-up, it was limited 
by several factors. The findings cannot be generalized to severely 
frail or terminally ill patients because these groups were 
excluded. However, we enrolled a diverse cohort and we were 
more interested in less severely frail patients who are amenable 
to preventive strategies. Although we did not compare different 
tools or assess more objective frailty measures, we selected a 
frailty tool that is easy to use, reliable and predictive of clinically 
relevant outcomes,16–18 and that has been recommended for use 
in other surgical populations.13 We did not assess long-term dis-
ability or quality of life, which may be of particular importance to 
clinicians and patients. Lastly, because a dose–response relation 
was not observed at 30 days, it is possible that our 30-day results 
were limited by lower event rates or that frailty is more impor-
tant for long-term than short-term prognosis. 
Conclusion
Identifying frailty in surgical patients will help to predict which 
patients are at high risk of adverse outcomes, thus improving 
patient and family discussions and targeting patients for 
enhanced postoperative care. Moreover, the results of this study 
suggest that poor postoperative prognosis is not limited to the 
most severely frail patients, but that vulnerable patients without 
evident disability are also at higher risk of readmission or death 
after discharge. Further studies are needed to assess the impact 
and feasibility of interventions in terms of changing frailty status 
or decreasing risks among frail surgical patients, but current evi-
dence supports the use of well-validated frailty assessments 
when evaluating risk for adverse postoperative outcomes.
