IMPORTANCE Pathology-based measures of human papillomavirus (HPV) status are routinely
obtained in the care of head and neck cancer and are clearly associated with patient outcome
for cancers of the oropharynx. However, it is unclear if HPV status is of high value for cancers
of the larynx and oral cavity. In addition, it is possible to assess HPV infection using
serology-based methods; however, the suitability of this pathology-independent measure for
predicting patient outcome in head and neck cancer is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether immunologic response to HPV16 is associated with
patient survival across anatomic sites, independent of smoking and drinking history.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a population-based study of 1054 patients
with head and neck cancer in the greater Boston, Massachusetts, area (1999-2003,
2006-2011).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause survival in relation to HPV16 E6 and E7
seropositivity.
RESULTS The 1054 patients reflected the demographics of those treated in this timeframe
(75% male; mean age, 59 years). Seropositivity was very strongly associated with improved
survival overall (hazard ratio HR], 0.33; 95% CI, 0.24-0.45; P < .001), with no evidence that
the magnitude of immune response, as assessed by titer levels, effected outcome.
Seropositivity was associated with improved patient survival across all head and neck cancer
sites: HR for oropharynx cancer, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.18-0.39; for oral cavity cancer, 0.45; 95% CI,
0.18-0.80; and for larynx cancer, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.10-0.85. In addition, the associations with
seropositivity were similar across smoking and/or drinking exposure groups: HR for low
exposure, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.20-1.36; for moderate exposure, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.25-0.70; for
heavy exposure, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.36-0.73. In a subset of 162 patients with both HPV serology
and p16 immunohistochemical (IHC) measures available, both measures were similarly
associated with survival in the oropharynx (HR for serology, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03-0.47; for p16
measures, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03-0.46), whereas only serology was associated with outcome
when considering all head and neck cancer cases (HR for serology, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.23-1.04;
for p16, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.30-1.42).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Collectively, these data suggest that a positive serologic
response to HPV16 oncoproteins may be the best approach to assess HPV-disease for clinical
outcome because it is associated with survival for all types of disease and is a marker that is
not dependent on pathology material.

H
uman papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) is a well-recog-
nizedetiologicfactorinoropharyngealcancer,withse-
rology-based data clearly demonstrating that infec-
tion precedes cancer occurrence.1 Oropharyngeal tumors that
arise as a result of HPV infection have a distinct mutation
landscape,2-4 and patients with HPV16-positive oropharyn-
geal cancer have markedly improved survival.5,6 Determina-
tion of HPV16 status is most often achieved using pathologic
materials. However, the accuracy of this testing may be com-
promised depending on the biomarker used (ie, p16 staining
is not highly specific to HPV16 infection outside the
oropharynx7 or among African Americans8) and the sam-
pling of the tumor (ie, if the presence of HPV is not clonal and
homogeneous throughout the pathology specimen9). Recent
work has demonstrated that seropositivity to HPV16 E6 and
E7 proteins, which can be assessed independent of pathology
material,isalsostronglyassociatedwithpatientsurvivalinoro-
pharyngeal cancer10 and can be used for monitoring cancer
recurrence.11 This work raises the interesting question as to
whether the magnitude of the serologic response to HPV16 is
an important prognosticator for oropharyngeal cancer.
WhiletheassociationofHPVwithoropharyngealcanceroc-
currence and outcome is established, there is continued con-
troversy regarding the role of HPV in cancers of the oral cavity
and larynx. A recent large, multisite study with multiple mark-
ers of infection suggests that active HPV infection is quite low
in oral cavity (4.4%) and laryngeal (3.5%) tumors.12 An analysis
ofRNA-sequencingdatainTheCancerGenomeAtlas(TCGA)tu-
mors detected HPV16 transcripts in approximately 10% of oral
cavity and 5% of larynx tumors.13 Despite the low rates of ac-
tive infection in these tumors, the prevalence of seropositivity
to HPV16 E6 and E7 proteins is dramatically higher in patients
with oral cavity and laryngeal cancers relative to healthy popu-
lation controls.14 Furthermore, while HPV16 has been inten-
sively investigated as a favorable prognostic factor for oropha-
ryngealcancer,lessisknownregardingtheassociationofHPV16
with outcome for these other anatomic sites. The most robust
data to date examined p16 expression (a surrogate for HPV sta-
tus)inbothoropharyngealandnonoropharyngealheadandneck
cancers, with a survival advantage observed for p16 (HPV)-
positive cancer in both groups.7 Finally, there is a paucity of in-

Methods
Study Population
Incident cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) were enrolled through major teaching hospitals
located in Boston, Massachusetts (Brigham and Women'
s Hos-
pital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Medical
Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Massachusetts Eye and
Ear Infirmary, Massachusetts General Hospital, and New
England Medical Center), as part of a population-based case-
control study of head and neck cancer in the greater Boston
area.17 Patients with a confirmed incident diagnosis of
HNSCC were included if they were residents in the study area
and 18 years or older. Patients with carcinoma in situ, or tu-
mors originating in the lip, salivary gland, or nasopharynx/
nasal cavity were excluded. Recurrent cases and incident cases
diagnosed more than 6 months prior to contact were also ex-
cluded. The study includes data collected from 2 periods of re-
cruitment from the same population: phase 1 was conducted
between December 1999 and December 2003 (533 cases) and
phase 2 was conducted between October 2006 and June 2011
(509 cases). All patients enrolled in the study provided writ-
ten informed consent as approved by the institutional review
boards of the participating institutions.
Tumors were classified as oral cavity, oropharynx, or lar-
ynx based on recommendations by the American Joint Com-
mittee on Cancer (AJCC). According to the AJCC, tumors at the
base of the tongue were classified as oropharyngeal, and those
located at the anterior of the tongue were classified as those of
the oral cavity. The pathology reports for patients with carci-
noma of the tongue were reviewed and further classified as lo-
cated at the anterior or the base of the tongue. This review was
conducted blinded to history of alcohol consumption, tobacco
use, and HPV16 status. Oral cavity tumors corresponded to
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9),
codes 143, 144, 145, and, if located at the anterior of the tongue,
141; oropharyngeal tumors corresponded to ICD-9 codes 146,
148, 149, and, if at the base of the tongue, 141; and laryngeal
tumors corresponded to ICD-9 code 161.
Patients completed a self-administered questionnaire that
was reviewed with study staff to obtain data on demographic
characteristics, medical history, family history of cancer, de-
tailed smoking and alcohol consumption habits, occupa-
tional history, and residential history. Survival time and vital
status were collected for all patients from the social security
Key Points
Question Does immune response to human papillomavirus (HPV)
E6 and E7 proteins predict patient outcomes for head and neck
cancer?
Findings Using a large, population-based study of patients with
head and neck cancer, we investigated the relationship between
patient titers for HPV E6 and E7 proteins at the time of diagnosis
and patient survival. Any positive seroresponse, irrespective of
level, was associated with a significantly improved outcome for all
forms of head and neck cancer (oropharyngeal, oral cavity, and
larynx.
Meaning Seropositivity to HPV E6 and E7 proteins may be a
useful alternative or adjunct to pathology-based testing for HPV in
head and neck cancers, particularly for tumors outside of the
oropharynx.

cluding telephone confirmation of vital status, retirement rec-
ords, and work history.
HPV Serology Measurement
Serum was separated from venous blood within 12 to 24
hours of blood drawing and stored at −80°C. To detect anti-
bodies against HPV16 E6 and E7 proteins, a glutathione
S-transferase capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay was used in combination with fluorescent bead
technology.18,19 This assay detects HPV antibodies with high
type specificity and demonstrates assay sensitivity similar to
the gold-standard for L1-serology that uses viruslike particles
(VLPs) as antigens.19 Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) val-
ues were dichotomized as antibody positive or negative.
Standardized cutoffs for HPV16 early proteins were deter-
mined using serum of 117 female, HPV16 DNA-negative, self-
reported virgins from a cross-sectional study among Korean
students.20 The mean + 5 SDs was calculated, and the result-
ing cutoff was doubled to stringently separate seropositive
and seronegative reactions (HPV16 E6: 484 MFI, and HPV16
E7: 1096 MFI21). Individuals were classified as HPV-positive if
they were seropositive for either the E6 or E7 proteins of
HPV16. This assay has been reported as highly reproducible
for both E6 and E7 antigens.1
P16 Immunohistochemical Analysis
Immunohistochemical staining for p16 was conducted using
a purified mouse anti-human p16INK4 monoclonal antibody kit
(clone E6H4, prediluted 1:2; mtm laboratories AG) with heat-
inducedantigenretrievalincitratebuffer(pH = 6.0)usingpres-
sure cooker pretreatment with positive and negative cell lines
(and normal mouse serum) as controls stained in parallel, as
described in detail previously.22 The staining intensity of posi-
tive cells was scored by 1 pathologist blind to patient serology
status and other data.
Statistical Methods
For each patient, all-cause 5-year survival was calculated from
the date of diagnosis to death or censoring event (loss to
follow-up or on achieving 5 years of follow-up). Univariate sur-
vival differences were assessed by Kaplan-Meier 5-year sur-
vival functions, and the difference between strata was as-
sessed using log-rank tests. Multivariable Cox proportional
hazards models were applied to calculate the hazard ratios
(HRs) and corresponding 95% CIs while controlling for poten-
tial confounders: age (continuous), race (white or nonwhite),
sex, education (high school graduate or less vs some college
or more), pack-years smoked (continuous), average alcoholic
beverages per week (continuous), study enrollment phase (1
or 2), site (oropharynx, oral cavity, or larynx), and stage (I, II,
III, IV). Missing values were imputed using multiple
imputation.23 The proportional hazards assumption was met
in both the overall survival analysis, and the anatomic site-
specific analyses. A Pearson Φ coefficient was used to test the
correlationbetween2binaryvariables.Statisticalanalyseswere
performed with R software, and all tests were 2-sided with a
α = .05 significance level.
Results
In total, 1054 patients with HNSCC were evaluated for HPV16

their mean age was 59 years. Demographic traits by HPV16 sta-
tus are presented in Table 1. Patients who were HPV16 sero-
positive were statistically younger and more likely to be male,
to be more educated, and to have experienced lighter smok-
ing and alcohol consumption. In addition, HPV16 seroposi-
tive patients were more likely to have tumors in the orophar-
ynx and present with advanced-stage disease.

ses, seropositivity was treated as a dichotomous (positive/

Given the well-established relationship between HPV16
and tumors arising in the oropharynx, we evaluated whether
the association between HPV16 serostatus and patient out-
come varied across anatomic site (Figure 2). The association
between HPV16 and survival was most prominent for the oro-
pharyngeal cancers. In addition, there were statistically sig-
nificant associations between HPV16 serostatus and patient
survival for tumors of the oral cavity and larynx. These asso-
ciations remained significant after adjustment for potential

the eTable in the Supplement). Positivity to either E6 or E7
alone was associated with improved outcome (HR, 0.46 and
0.55, respectively), while those seropositive for both E6 and
E7 had the best outcomes (HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.13-0.48).
A subset of 162 cases had information on both HPV16 se-
rology and p16 staining in the tumor with a modest associa-
tion observed between the 2 measures (φ-coefficient, 0.73).
Considering all cases, only the serology measure was associ-
ated with patient survival, although with limited precision (HR
for serology, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.23-1.04]; HR for p16, 0.84 [95%
CI, 0.44-1.58]). As expected, in 56 patients with oropharynx
tumors, both measures were strongly associated with out-
come (HR for serology, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.03-0.47]; HR for p16,
0.16 [95% CI, 0.03-0.46]).
Finally, we investigated whether the association be-
tweenHPVserostatusandoutcomedifferedbyhistoryofsmok-
ing and alcohol consumption. Patient exposure was catego-
rized as having either a light (lowest tertile for both smoking
and alcohol consumption), moderate (middle tertile for at ≥1
exposure), or heavy (highest tertile for either smoking or al-
cohol consumption) (Figure 3). Again, in all subgroups HPV16
serostatus was associated with better patient survival. This re-
mained true after adjustment for possible confounding vari-
ables.
Discussion
Using the resources of a large, population-based study, we
have demonstrated that a positive serologic response to
HPV16 oncoproteins is associated with improved patient
survival, an association that persists across anatomic sites
and patient history of tobacco and alcohol exposure. These
data are among the first to demonstrate a convincing rela-
tionship between HPV16 and improved patient survival for
tumors of the larynx and oral cavity, and are consistent with
the analysis of p16 expression and patient outcomes in
patients with nonoropharyngeal cancer in head and neck
cancer treatment trials.7 Although HPV contributes to a
smaller fraction of disease at these sites, our data would
strongly suggest that immune response to HPV16 infection
has clear prognostic clinical significance, similar to and con-
sistent with the data for oropharyngeal cancers. In addition,
our data are among the first to examine the potential inter-
action between HPV and patient smoking and drinking his-
tory in head and neck cancer survival. Finally, these data
demonstrate that it will be possible to evaluate HPV in head
and neck cancer using a blood-based, rather than tumor-
based, measurement.
There are limited prior data examining the association
between HPV16 and outcome in the oral cavity, with the
most directly comparable data observing a nonstatistically
significant association between HPV16 seropositivity and
improved outcome for oral cancer.24 However, it must be
noted that this prior study was underpowered (with only 13
seropositive oral cancer cases). More recently, Chung et al,7
using data from several clinical trials, demonstrated that
p16 expression for nonoropharyngeal was inversely associ-
ated with patient outcome, consistent with our observa-
tions. However, results for tumors originating in the oral
cavity were not statistically significant (HR, 0.7; 95% CI,
0.33-1.47). This may be attributable to the poor correlation
between p16 overexpression and HPV status in the oral
cavity.7,25 In contrast, and in support of our approach,
Anderson et al26 have described a positive association
between serology and HPV tumor status. These results sug-
gest that estimates of association that rely on p16 overex-
pression likely bias results, with potential implications for
use of this methodology in clinical practice.
There are 2 additional reports27,28 that describe HPV16 as
a poor prognosticator for oral cavity cancers, in direct con-
trast to both our data and the well-established association of
HPV infection and improved outcomes for oropharyngeal
cancer. The differences in our data compared with Lee et al27
and Duray et al28 may be attributable to multiple factors,
including study design. Lee et al27 reported a marked reduc-
tion in patient survival for patients with HPV16-positive
advanced-stage oral cavity cancer in South Asia, a popula-
tion with an elevated rate of HNSCC. The high prevalence of
betel quid chewing in their study population (85%), as well
as differences in the distribution of age, smoking, alcohol
habit, and, potentially, clinical approach to the patients, may
contribute to the counterintuitive associations observed in
their study. Furthermore, they used a polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)-based method in assessing HPV status, and
this has not universally been proven to be a sensitive and
specific approach.29-31 Duray et al28 studied a Western popu-
lation without the presence of betel quid exposure but with
a high incidence of HNSCC (in Belgium), with a very high
prevalence of smoking and alcohol consumption both in the
HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients.28 They also used a
PCR-based approach for HPV 16 detection, and this yielded a
high-risk HPV prevalence of 44% in the oral cavity, much
higher than our serology-based measure (17%), the recent
analysis of TCGA tumors,13 and the prevalence reported in
other published studies.32 Our results derive from a prospec-
tively collected population-based study, also distinctly dif-
ferent than these 2 prior reports. Furthermore, our results

are highly consistent with the established paradigm in the
oropharynx. While the etiologic fraction of oral cancer
attributable to high-risk HPV is low,33 our observation of a
significant association between infection and survival of oral
cancer indicates that HPV16 seropositivity in patients with
oral cancer is of high clinical importance.
Less well-studied is the question of HPV16 infection and
clinical outcome in laryngeal cancers. In the analysis of
clinical trial data (n = 140 laryngeal cancers), there was a
nonstatistically significant association between p16 and
improved survival (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.27-1.10),7 consistent
with our data. In a larger collection of laryngeal cancers
(n = 324) p16 staining was not associated with outcome,34
although that analysis was limited to a 2-year survival time
that may not be sufficient to detect HPV-driven differences.
Other small studies have reported either no association,35-37
or that HPV is associated with worse outcome.38 The choice
of marker to assess HPV may be particularly problematic in
the larynx: HPV DNA has been detected at high frequency in
pathologically normal tissue of the larynx,39 and there is a
documented poor correlation of HPV DNA detection in
serial sections of laryngeal tumors.9
There is an urgent need in the oral oncology field to
arrive at consensus on HPV testing methodology. p16
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been used in many semi-
nal studies of oropharyngeal cancer, but misclassification of
tumors clearly occurs, as the p16 gene can be altered by
nonviral mechanisms. Among African Americans there
is low concordance between p16 expression and HPV
detection.8 In addition, the positive predictive value of p16
IHC outside the pharynx is low, presumably because
tobacco carcinogens also disrupt the Rb pathway, mimick-
ing the action of HPV16.28,33 Our analysis, which included
both HPV and smoking, demonstrates that smokers without
immune evidence of HPV infection (who would potentially
be misclassified using the p16 measure) have the worst sur-
vival outcomes, supporting our notion that p16 is not the
best marker for clinical use. Another common metric, detec-
tion of HPV DNA in tumors, is problematic, as Halec et al9
have demonstrated a lack of reproducibility in DNA-based
measures in serial tumor sections.
Limitations
Our study is not without limitations, and we specifically note
that the lack of direct comparison with HPV RNA or DNA de-
tection within tumor specimens limits our ability to com-
pletely assess HPV status. Furthermore, the lack of assess-
ment of non-HPV16 subtypes is also a limitation in that we do
not have complete high-risk HPV characterization.
Finally, an alternative interpretation of our results is
that serology is not necessarily capturing solely HPV-DNA
status of the tumor but rather an immune phenotype that
is beneficial for cancer outcome. Viral exposures shape
immunity, and this has been well documented for
cytomegalovirus.40 It is not yet known how an HPV infec-
tion may shape and immunity and how that relates to sur-
veillance for cancer recurrence. We posit that HPV is not
only important as an oncogenic driver of certain head and
neck cancers, but also as a modulator of immunity that has
an impact on the ability of the immune system to identify
and remove residual cancer cells.

Conclusions
Using a large case series of head and neck cancers from a
defined geographic region we have demonstrated that sero-
logic evidence of high-risk HPV infection is associated with
outcomes in not just oropharyngeal cancers but also oral
cavity and laryngeal cancer. There is an urgent need for
additional research that applies a consensus approach to
HPV16 detection in similar large, population-based samples
to improve the statistical precision of our estimates of asso-
ciation. Importantly, this will allow for the inclusion of
patients with oral cavity and laryngeal cancer in the now
developing deescalation trials.
