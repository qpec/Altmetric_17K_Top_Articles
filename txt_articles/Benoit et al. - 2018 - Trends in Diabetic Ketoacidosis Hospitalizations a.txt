Diabetes is a common chronic condition and as of 2015, 
approximately 30 million persons in the United States had 
diabetes (23 million with diagnosed and 7 million with undi-
agnosed) (1). Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening 
but preventable complication of diabetes characterized by 
uncontrolled hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dL), metabolic aci-
dosis, and increased ketone concentration that occurs most 
frequently in persons with type 1 diabetes (2). CDC’s United 
States Diabetes Surveillance System* (USDSS) indicated an 
increase in hospitalization rates for DKA during 2009–2014, 
most notably in persons aged <45 years. To explore this finding, 
2000–2014 data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and 
Quality’s National Inpatient Sample (NIS)† were assembled to 
calculate trends in DKA hospitalization rates and in-hospital 
case-fatality rates. Overall, age-adjusted DKA hospitalization 
rates decreased slightly from 2000 to 2009, then reversed 
direction, steadily increasing from 2009 to 2014 at an average 
annual rate of 6.3%. In-hospital case-fatality rates declined 
consistently during the study period from 1.1% to 0.4%. 
Better understanding the causes of this increasing trend in DKA 
hospitalizations and decreasing trend in in-hospital case-fatality 
through further exploration using multiple data sources will 
facilitate the targeting of prevention efforts.
NIS is a nationally representative sample of hospital 
discharges, corresponding to >35 million hospitalizations 
annually. Discharges with a first-listed, primary International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
(ICD-9-CM) code of 250.1 (diabetes with ketoacidosis) were 
considered DKA hospitalizations (1,3). To calculate DKA 
hospitalization rates among persons with diabetes, the civilian, 
noninstitutionalized population with diabetes was estimated 
using corresponding years of data from CDC’s National Health 
Interview Survey (NHIS).§ Because diabetes type was not 
collected in NHIS, rates were not stratified by disease type. 
In-hospital case-fatality rate was defined as the proportion of 
persons hospitalized for DKA who died in the hospital.
DKA rates were age-adjusted using four age groups (<45, 
45–64, 65–74, and ≥75 years) from the 2000 U.S. Census.

to identify points where linear trends change significantly in 
direction or magnitude, were used to analyze trends in DKA 
hospitalization and case-fatality rates, stratified by age group 
and sex, allowing for a maximum of two joinpoints. In the 
final model, each trend segment was described by an annual 
percent change, and the trend for each period was tested to 
determine whether the slope was significantly different from 
zero. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
The analysis accounted for the complex sampling designs of 
NIS and NHIS.
From 2000 to 2009, the age-adjusted rate of DKA hospital-
izations among persons with diabetes fluctuated but declined 
at an average annual rate of 1.1% (Figure) (Table 1). During 
2009–2014, however, the rate increased 54.9%, from 19.5 to 
30.2 per 1,000 persons, at an average annual rate of 6.3%. 
The reversal in trend was apparent across all age groups and 
both sexes. Rates were highest in persons aged <45 years 
(44.3 per 1,000 in 2014) and lowest in persons aged ≥65 years 
(<2.0 per 1,000) (Table 1).
In-hospital case-fatality rates declined during 2000–2014 at 
an annual average rate of 6.8% (from 1.1% to 0.4% [63.6% 
decline overall]); no joinpoints were found (Figure) (Table 2). 
The declining rates were seen across all age groups and both 
sexes. Although the highest case-fatality rates were observed 
among persons aged ≥75 years, this group experienced the 
largest absolute decrease across the entire period.
Discussion
Although DKA hospitalization rates among persons with 
diabetes declined slightly from 2000 to 2009, this trend 
reversed, with rates increasing 54.9% from 2009 to 2014. 
From 2009 to 2014 all age groups experienced an increase of 
≥6.0% annually in DKA hospitalization rates, with highest 
rates among persons aged <45 years. This increase in DKA 
hospitalization rates is concerning because DKA is a life-
threatening but avoidable complication of diabetes. Despite 
the increase in DKA hospitalization rates, however, in-hospital 
mortality among persons with DKA consistently decreased 
over the study period. Identification of factors contributing 
to the increase in hospitalizations for DKA might help target 
prevention efforts.
Although DKA is more common among persons with type 1 
diabetes, it also occurs among persons with type 2 diabetes (2).

DKA can be the initial sign of unrecognized type 1 or type 2 
diabetes; however, it occurs more frequently in persons with 
established disease (4). Two studies among youths found either 
stable or decreasing rates of DKA at the time of diagnosis of 
diabetes, suggesting that younger persons with established 
disease and poor glucose control might be the group con-
tributing most to the increase in DKA hospitalization rates 
among persons aged <45 years (5,6). However, whether DKA 
is occurring at the time of diagnosis or among persons with 
established disease in adults is unknown.
The causes of the increase in DKA hospitalization rates 
are not clear, but several possible explanations include the 
following: changes in case definition, new medications that 
might increase the risk for DKA, and higher admission rates 
because of lower thresholds for hospitalization (i.e., admission 
of persons with less serious disease). Although the American 
Diabetes Association definition of DKA has not changed 
over the years, the most recent 2009 publication described a 
“euglycemic DKA” type characterized by metabolic acidosis 
and increased total body ketone concentration, but with glucose 
levels ≤250 mg/dL, occurring in approximately 10% of patients 
with DKA (7). Euglycemic DKA hospitalizations might have 
resulted in an increase in the number of hospitalized patients 
classified as having DKA, but NIS does not have laboratory 
data to corroborate this hypothesis. This hypothesis assumes 
that DKA case definitions are uniformly applied in clinical 
practice, which in a call for standardization of diagnostic 
criteria for DKA was demonstrated to be unlikely (8).
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, a class 
of prescription medications used to treat type 2 diabetes, 
were approved in March 2013. In December 2015, the Food 
and Drug Administration added a label to SGLT2 inhibitors 
warning that these medications might increase the risk for 
DKA. Because SGLT2 inhibitors were only recently approved, 
and DKA rates increased before their introduction, they are 
likely not a major contributor to the increasing DKA trend but 
do remain an ongoing concern for future events. More recent 
higher admission rates for less severe cases of DKA could also 
explain an increased trend in DKA admissions. Although no 
evidence that this occurred exists, analyzing emergency depart-
ment data might help confirm or refute this hypothesis.
The causes of the decrease in DKA in-hospital mortality are 
also not clear. Better understanding of the pathophysiology 
of DKA and adoption of DKA treatment guidelines, both of 
which might have led to better management and treatment, 
have been proposed as reasons for declines in DKA in-hospital 
mortality (2). Another possibility is that hospital admission of 
less severe cases has resulted in higher admission rates and con-
tributed to the lower in-hospital case-fatality rates over time.
In the early 2000s, an increase in DKA cases among per-
sons with obesity and type 2 diabetes was reported (9). These 
patients had impaired insulin levels but lacked typical autoim-
mune markers of type 1 disease, and their beta-cell function 
recovered quickly after treatment. This disease type, named 
ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, has features of both type 1 and 
type 2 disease. Other variants of diabetes have been described, 
but no evidence that rates of these disease variants are increasing 
and thus contributing to the increased DKA hospitalization 
rates could be found (10).
In 2014, the DKA hospitalization rate among persons with 
diabetes aged <45 years was approximately 27 times the rate 
among persons aged ≥65 years. Therefore, efforts to understand 
factors contributing to the increase in hospitalizations for DKA 
should consider the demographic and clinical characteristics

of youths and young adults. Information from studies among 
these groups might help determine whether factors such as 
symptom recognition, adherence to therapy, self-management 
skills, access to care, or cost of treatment should be a focus of 
DKA prevention strategies.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limi-
tations. First, NIS does not include federal hospitals, which 
would lead to an underestimate of the total number of DKA 
hospitalizations; however, NIS represents approximately 96% 
of the U.S. population. Second, although in-hospital DKA 
case-fatality rates declined, mortality rates at home or in the 
emergency department setting were not investigated. Third, 
the DKA case definition used in this analysis was based on an 
ICD-9-CM code from the hospital discharge record that could 
not be validated. Misclassification might have occurred leading 
to over- or underestimation of hospitalization rates. However, 
misclassification caused by changing coding practices over 
time is unlikely. Finally, results were not stratified by diabetes 
type, and persons with type 1 diabetes are at particularly high 
risk for DKA.  
DKA hospitalizations in the United States have increased 
among all age groups, with the highest rates among persons 
aged <45 years. Although the continued decline in in-hospital 
DKA mortality is encouraging, further work might help iden-
tify populations at risk. Evidence-based, targeted prevention 
measures, such as diabetes self-management education and 
support might help reverse the trend in this potentially life-
threatening but avoidable complication of diabetes.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of 
diabetes, a disease that affects approximately 30 million 
persons in the United States. DKA is more common among 
persons with type 1 diabetes.
What is added by this report?
After a slight decline during 2000–2009, hospitalizations for 
DKA increased in the United States during 2009–2014 among all 
age groups and were highest among persons aged <45 years. 
Concurrently, in-hospital case-fatality rates among persons with 
DKA consistently decreased from 2000 to 2014. 
What are the implications for public health practice?
DKA is a life-threatening but avoidable complication of 
diabetes. Prevention measures, such as diabetes self-
management education, might help reverse the increasing 
trend in DKA, especially in persons aged <45 years who have 
the highest DKA rates.
