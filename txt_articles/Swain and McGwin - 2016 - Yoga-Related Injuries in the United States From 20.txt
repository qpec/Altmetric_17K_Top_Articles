Background: Yoga has become more popular among people in the United States and has been touted by both yoga participants
as well as some physicians and researchers for its health benefits. While the health benefits have been studied, the frequency of
injury among yoga participants has not been well documented.
Purpose: Injury incidence, rates, and types associated with yoga in the United States have not been quantified. This study esti-
mates US yoga-associated injury incidence and characterizes injury type over a 13-year period.
Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study.
Methods: Data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) from 2001 to 2014 were used to estimate the
incidence and type of yoga-associated injuries. The number and age distribution of yoga participants was estimated using data
from National Health Statistics Reports. These national population estimates were applied to the NEISS data to determine injury
rates overall and stratified according to age categories.
Results: There were 29,590 yoga-related injuries seen in hospital emergency departments from 2001 to 2014. The trunk (46.6%)
was the most frequent region injured, and sprain/strain (45.0%) accounted for the majority of diagnoses. The injury rate increased
overall from 2001 to 2014, and it was greatest for those aged 65 years and older (57.9/100,000) compared with those aged 18 to
44 years (11.9/100,000) and 45 to 64 years (17.7/100,000) in 2014.
Conclusion: Participants aged 65 years and older have a greater rate of injury from practicing yoga when compared with other age
groups. Most injuries sustained were to the trunk and involved a sprain/strain. While there are many health benefits to practicing
yoga, participants and those wishing to become participants should confer with a physician prior to engaging in physical activity
and practice only under the guidance of certified instructors.

The practice of yoga has become increasingly commonplace
in American society, with the number of participants nearly
doubling from 5.1% to 9.5% of adults in the United States
from 2007 to 2012.11 Yoga is an encompassing activity and
can refer to an array of physical and mental activities,
including stretching, physical postures, breath control, and
meditation.12 Yoga is touted for its overall health benefits
and mental well-being; participants indicate indirect
health benefits through improved physical fitness and
reduced stress as well as direct health benefits such as
reduced back and neck pain, arthritis, and anxiety.25
Recently, there have been a number of studies that
sought to compare outcome measures and burdens of vari-
ous diseases while incorporating yoga as complementary
therapy. For example, a review article of 13 nonrandomized
and 12 randomized controlled trials of patients with type 2
diabetes found that the practice of yoga promoted signifi-
cant improvements in glycemic control, lipid levels, and
body composition.22 Yoga has been shown to improve
depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance among pregnant
women as well as improving fatigue and depression among
breast cancer patients.4,7,15,18,19,26,41 Yoga has improved
arrhythmia burden, heart rate, and blood pressure among
patients with atrial fibrillation.13,23 Additionally, yoga has
been shown to improve outcomes for stroke patients as well
as those with chronic neck and back pain.24,31 For older

 individuals, a lack of balance and falling can indicate a
physical decline; however, yoga has been shown to improve
balance and self-perception of falling.6,27,30,33
According to the National Institutes of Health, yoga is safe
for healthy individuals when practiced with a well-educated
instructor; however, caution is given that adverse effects can
occur, including nerve damage and even stroke.25 In an Aus-
tralian national survey, 78.7% of respondents reported never
having been injured while practicing yoga, and among those
who did report injuries, many were strains or related to
injuries that occurred more than 12 months prior.28 A survey
of more than 1300 yoga teachers worldwide indicated that
the most frequent injuries occurred to the neck, lower back,
knee, shoulder, and wrist, and the most common causes
were poor technique, poor instruction, previous injury, and
excess effort.16 Another study found that less than 1% of
yoga participants who were injured stopped participating
due to injury.20 When examining the risks and benefits of
yoga as an alternative therapy for osteoporosis and spinal
movement in aging adults, it was found that moderate flex-
ion and extension was beneficial; however, caution is given
that therapy should be individualized, as bone density can
differ and some yoga positions can be damaging.32,33
A case series of yoga-related injuries from 1991 to 2010 at
a single hospital emergency department in Canada found
that 73% of cases were seen after 2005, showing that the
number of injuries is increasing.29 They found that sprain
(34%) was the most common injury, and the lower extrem-
ity (42%) was the most frequently injured body region.29
Additionally, children were significantly more likely to be
injured than adults; however, more adults needed treat-
ment for injuries.29
While the practice of yoga is beneficial for many regard-
less of health status, the possibility of injury due to the
practice still exists. Additionally, the incidence of yoga inju-
ries in the United States is not well characterized. The
purpose of this study was to determine the number of
yoga-related injuries in the United States from 2001 to
2014 seen by emergency departments and describe injury
characteristics so the risk of injury involved in participat-
ing in yoga is established.
METHODS
Data Source
The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System
(NEISS) database from 2001 to 2014 was used to identify
yoga-related injuries.37 NEISS is a database maintained by
the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), utiliz-
ing a national probability sample of 100 hospitals in the
United States.38 Information is collected by NEISS-
trained coordinators at participating facilities to acquire
information on emergency department visits involving var-
ious consumer products, including sporting activities. Nar-
ratives entered into the database are reviewed by CPSC
staff to ensure proper categorization and case validity.38,39
Institutional review board exemption was obtained from
the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
While NEISS codes for various sporting activities, yoga is
not a specific category; therefore, to determine whether
cases were related to yoga, narratives were searched for the
term yoga. Narratives were then reviewed to exclude obser-
vations that did not clearly involve the practicing of yoga.
For example, case narratives similar to ‘‘neck pain unsure if
from lifting or yoga’’ or ‘‘fell off toilet after sauna/steam/
yoga’’ were excluded. Additionally, observations involving
yoga-related equipment but not the actual practice of yoga
were excluded, (eg, ‘‘[patient] tripped over wife’s yoga ball
and fell hitting head on floor’’). To ensure correct classifi-
cation of yoga-related observations, narratives were
reviewed by a second person and discrepancies were dis-
cussed until concordance was achieved. Patients younger
than 18 years were excluded from this study due to lack of
information on the number of youth yoga participants in
the United States. In all, 818 observations were reviewed
that contained the term yoga. After review, 774 were
deemed related to the practice of yoga and were used to
determine the weighted estimates of the total number of
yoga injuries from 2001 to 2014.
Variable Definitions
Information on the patient’s age, sex, race, incident locale,
body part affected, diagnosis, and disposition were collected
by the NEISS. Three age categories were created: 18 to 44
years, 45 to 64 years, and older than 65 years. Race was
classified as white, black, other, and not recorded. Observa-
tions listed as white, black, and not recorded were catego-
rized as such, and ‘‘other’’ included other, Asian, American
Indian/Alaska native, and native Hawaiian/Pacific
Islander. Incident locale was categorized as place of recre-
ation, home, not recorded, and other. ‘‘Place of recreation’’
corresponded to place of recreation or sports and ‘‘home’’
included locales designated as home and mobile/manufac-
tured home. The category ‘‘other’’ encompassed farm/ranch,
street or highway, other public property, industrial, and
school. ‘‘Not recorded’’ included all cases were the location
was not recorded.
The body region injured was classified into trunk, upper
limb, lower limb, head, and other. ‘‘Trunk’’ included shoul-
der, upper trunk, lower trunk, and pubic region. Injuries to
‘‘upper limb’’ included the elbow, lower arm, wrist, upper
arm, hand, and finger; ‘‘lower limb’’ encompassed the knee,
lower leg, ankle, upper leg, foot, and toe. Injuries to the
‘‘head’’ were composed of injuries sustained to the head,
face, eyeball, mouth (including lips, teeth, and tongue), ear,
and neck. ‘‘Other’’ included all other parts of body (more
than 50%), not recorded, and internal. Injury diagnoses
were categorized as abrasion, dislocation, fracture, strain/
sprain, not stated, and other. Each diagnosis corresponded
to the NEISS diagnosis with the exception of ‘‘other,’’ which
included concussion, foreign body, hematoma, laceration,
nerve damage, internal organ injury, puncture, hemor-
rhage, poisoning, and dermatitis/conjunctivitis. Hospital
disposition included treated and released, admitted, and
other. ‘‘Other’’ comprised those treated and transferred to
another hospital, held for observation, left without being
seen or against medical advice, and not recorded.

 Statistical Analysis
In this descriptive epidemiology study, frequencies for
patient demographic and diagnosis variables were calcu-
lated using weighted estimates with 95% confidence limits
(95% CI) to account for sampling used by the NEISS. Inci-
dence rates were calculated based on the estimated number
of yoga participants in the US. To determine the number of
yoga participants, the proportion of the US population who
practiced yoga was acquired from the 2002, 2007, and 2012
National Health Statistics Reports.2,11 These proportions
were then applied to US census population estimates, by
age group, for each corresponding year to establish the esti-
mated number of participants.35,36 For the remaining
years, the 2015 Sports Fitness Industry Association report
was used to estimate the number of participants in each age
group for 2001 to 2006, 2008 to 2011, and 2013 to 2014.34
To determine the ratio of male to female participants, the
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Behav-
ioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) (2011-
2013) was used.8,9 According to the BRFSS, males repre-
sented 16.9% and females 83.1% of yoga participants dur-
ing this period. These proportions were applied to the total
estimated number of participants to quantify the number of
male and female participants per year. Due to the lack of
available information, the ratio of male and female partici-
pants was assumed to be constant from year to year.
RESULTS
From 2001 to 2014 there were an estimated 29,590 yoga-
related injury cases that sought treatment at US emer-
gency departments. As shown in Table 1, the majority
(53.2%) were aged 18 to 44 years and female (81.4%). A
place of recreation (45.5%) was the most frequent locale at
the time of injury. Injuries to the trunk (46.6%) and lower
limb (21.9%) accounted for the majority of body regions
injured, and strain/sprain was the most common diagnosis
(45.03%).
The overall injury rate increased from 9.55 per 100,000
participants in 2001 to 17.01 per 100,000 participants in
2014 (Figure 1). In general, injury rates fluctuated consis-
tently when comparing males and females. Those aged 18
to 44 years had an injury rate of only 6.23 per 100,000
participants in 2004 and 11.90 per 100,000 in 2014. Com-
pared with the overall injury rates from 2004 to 2011, the
rate among those aged 18 to 44 years was considerably
lower. In contrast, those aged �65 years had far greater
injury rates from 2004 to 2014 when compared with the
overall rates; specifically, in 2004, those �65 years had
18.41 injuries per 100,000 participants compared with
57.91 injuries per 100,000 in 2014.
Examining injury rates stratified by body region injured
(Figure 2), rates for injuries to the trunk increased from
2001 to 2014. Additionally, trunk injury rates were consid-
erably greater than other regions, with 8.41 injuries per
100,000 participants in 2014. Overall, injury rates for the
head and lower limb increased from 2001 to 2014. Rates
between head and lower limb injuries were comparable with
3.49 injuries per 100,000 participants for head and 3.92
injuries per 100,000 participants for lower limb in 2014.
When examining injury rates for the overall period from
2001 to 2014 by body region injured stratified by sex and
age category (Table 2), those 65 years and older had the
greatest rates for each body region. For injury diagnosis,
those aged 45 to 64 years had a rate of 8.1 per 100,000 for
strain/sprain, and those aged 65þ years had a rate of 7.20
per 100,000. The rate of fractures among those 65 years and
older was nearly 3 times that of those aged 45 to 64 years
(2.21 per 100,000 vs 0.75 per 100,000). When comparing
hospital disposition, the rate of hospital admission was
greatest for those 65 years and older at 2.09 per 100,000.
DISCUSSION
The incidence of yoga-related injuries increased from 2001
to 2014. Of note, the analysis indicates that injury rates
increased 8-fold for those aged 65 years or older; the injury
rate among those 18 to 44 years only increased fractionally
and doubled among those 45 to 64 years during this period. In

 accordance with the finding that sprain/strain was the most
common injury, a study of 66 cases at a Canadian emergency
department found that sprain was the frequent injury
(34%).29 Additionally, when looking from 1991 to 2010, they
found that 73% of cases occurred after 2005, which supports
the finding that yoga injury rates are increasing.29
While lack of technique and experience could explain
some of the increase in injury incidence, the finding of
greater incidence among those older than 65 years is high-
lighted bythe factthey only had a 2% increasein participants
while those 18 to 44 years had a 5% increase. If lack of tech-
nique and experience alone was the cause for adverse yoga

 events,theanalysiswouldshowthatthoseaged18to44years
had the greatest increase in injury rates. The results suggest
that regardless of technique and experience, people older
than 44 years, and especially those older than 65 years, are
at greater risk of injury associated with practicing yoga.
The high rate of injury among those 65 years or older
could be explained by biological changes induced through
aging. For example, in a study that compared young (mean,
28.9 years) and old (mean, 60.2 years) runners, older indi-
viduals had significantly lower flexibility and strength in
the hip and ankle.17 With increased age, bone density
decreases, causing bones to break more easily, joint/spinal
issues, and cartilage decreases in lower body joints.3,21,32
This notion is supported by the fact that those aged 65 years
and older had a fracture rate of 2.21 per 100,000 compared
with a rate of 0.41 per 100,000 among those 18 to 44 years
and 0.75 per 100,000 among those 45 to 64 years. Addition-
ally, decreased muscle density, sarcopenia, and changes in
muscle fiber type reduce muscle strength and flexibil-
ity.14,21,40 The relevance of physical decline, both reduced
muscle mass and bone density, as playing a role in injuries
among older individuals is highlighted by the fact that in
2014, an unintentional fall was the lead cause of injury
death among those 65 years and older.10
Since there was an increase in incidence of injury among
all age groups from 2001 to 2014, factors besides aging
must also be present. One potential cause for the increase
is lack of qualified instructors.16 With an increase in the
number of yoga participants, there has been increased
need for instructors; according to a 2015 article, there are
more registered yoga instructors than ever before, even
more than needed by the industry.1 With the increase in
both the number of certified instructors and injuries it
would seem that there is a potential lack of appropriate
education even for certified instructors. Some in the
industry agree with this assessment and state that train-
ing programs, particularly dominated by 1 alliance stan-
dard, do not prepare instructors well to prevent injury.1,5
They also propose that instead of larger group certification
courses, the standard should be more traditional yoga
instruction with 1-on-1 training.1,5
With the many positive health benefits associated with
practicing yoga, the injury analysis provided in this article
should not deter individuals, even older individuals, from
participating. However, caution should be used, as with
any physically exertive activity; those wanting to partici-
pate should discuss their physical health with their physi-
cian.25 Although one should participate in yoga at a well-
known studio with qualified instructors, more important,
an individual should not engage in poses that they feel are
beyond their physical limitations.25
This study is limited in that the cases were estimates of
individuals who sought treatment only at emergency
departments. Moreover, only narratives that included the
term yoga were used since yoga is not a specifically tracked
sport. Due to this, estimates are likely lower than the total
number of yoga-related injuries occurring in the United
States since treatment could have been sought elsewhere
or cases could have been classified as ‘‘sport or recreational
activity not listed elsewhere’’ without mention of the spe-
cific activity in the narrative. Additionally, since older indi-
viduals are more likely to have severe injuries associated
with yoga and therefore need emergency help, their rate of
injury when compared with younger age groups is likely
elevated. The population used to determine injury rates
was also compiled using data from several sources, which
could lead to error in estimating injury rates. Future
research of yoga-related injuries would benefit from a
well-defined participant population to include those youn-
ger than 18 years. Future research would also improve if

CONCLUSION
Yoga is a safe form of exercise with positive impacts on
various aspects of a person’s health; however, those wish-

sonal limitations, particularly individuals 65 years and
older. National standards for yoga instructor certification
should be created and should more aggressively teach infor-
mation about safety and injury prevention.
