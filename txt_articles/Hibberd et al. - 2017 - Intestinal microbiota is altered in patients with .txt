ABSTRACT
Objective: The colonic microbiota is altered in
patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). We investigated
the microbiota composition of patients with colon
cancer compared with controls devoid of neoplastic or
inflammatory disease and the potential to modify the
colonic microbiota with probiotics.
Design: Biopsy samples were obtained from the
normal mucosa and tumour during colonoscopy from
15 patients with colon cancer. Subsequent patient-
matched samples were taken at surgery from the
tumour and nearby mucosa from the patients with
cancer, eight of whom had received two daily tablets
totalling 1.4×1010 CFUs Bifidobacterium lactis Bl-04
and 7×109 CFUs Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
Faecal samples were obtained after colonoscopy prior
to starting the intervention and at surgery. In addition,
21 mucosal biopsies from non-cancer controls were
obtained during colonoscopy followed by later faecal
samples. The colonic and faecal microbiota was
assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.
Results: The tumour microbiota was characterised by
increased microbial diversity and enrichment of several
taxa including Fusobacterium, Selenomonas and
Peptostreptococcus compared with the control microbiota.
Patients with colon cancer that received probiotics had
an increased abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria,
especially Faecalibacterium and Clostridiales spp in the
tumour, non-tumour mucosa and faecal microbiota.
CRC-associated genera such as Fusobacterium and
Peptostreptococcus tended to be reduced in the faecal
microbiota of patients that received probiotics.
Conclusions: Patients with colon cancer harbour a
distinct microbiota signature in the tumour tissue and
nearby mucosa, which was altered with probiotic
intervention. Our results show promise for potential
therapeutic benefits in CRC by manipulation of the
microbiota.

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) currently affects
∼1.4 million people each year and its inci-
dence is increasing worldwide.1 Despite novel
Summary box
What is already known about this subject?
▸ The risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) is strongly
associated with lifestyle factors, including a
dietary component which may be mediated by
the intestinal microbiota.
▸ The intestinal microbiome is altered in patients
with CRC, and there is a strong interest in identi-
fying potential microbial markers for CRC.
▸ Specific probiotic bacteria have been shown to
modulate inflammation and reduce tumour pro-
liferation in animal models of carcinogenesis
and may offer therapeutic benefits for CRC
patients.
What are the new findings?
▸ The colon cancer-associated microbiota exhibits
a distinct signature characterised by increased
mucosal
microbial
diversity
and
differential
abundance of specific bacterial taxa compared
with non-cancer controls. Oral-associated patho-
gens
are
over-represented
in
colon
cancer
tumours and tend to co-occur.
▸ Although more difficult to obtain, intestinal
mucosa samples, rather than faecal, provide a
more comprehensive assessment of microbiota
changes in colon cancer. Peptostreptococcus
was over-represented in both mucosal and
faecal samples and shows promise as a CRC
marker.
▸ The colon cancer-associated microbial signature
was modified by probiotic intervention and was
characterised by the enrichment of butyrate-
producing bacteria in the intestinal tissue.
How might it impact on clinical practice in
the foreseeable future?
▸ The CRC-associated microbiota is being continu-
ally defined as new biomarkers of CRC are dis-
covered. The microbial dysbiosis observed in
patients with CRC may be manipulated by pro-
biotic bacteria, and the probiotic strains used in
this study show promise as a beneficial compo-
nent of treatment and therapeutic development
in CRC.

 treatment strategies, the mortality rate is very high among
patients with advanced stages of the disease. The majority
of CRC cases (70%) arise sporadically in a time-dependent
manner according to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence of
genetic alterations.2 Accumulating evidence points to a
strong link between lifestyle factors and the risk of develop-
ing CRC. Risk factors include advanced age, tobacco and
alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, increased body
weight and diet (eg, high consumption of red and pro-
cessed meat), with the latter being the most significant.3
The strong connection to lifestyle factors indicates that
CRC incidence can be influenced by lifestyle changes.
Microbial imbalance (dysbiosis) in the gut can be
caused by environmental factors (eg, diet, infection,
antibiotics), but little is known about how the compos-
ition of the microbiota affects development of CRC. We
hypothesise that the association between CRC risk and
diet is partially mediated by the gut microbiota. Recent
studies show that the gut microbiota differs between
patients with and without CRC or colon adenomas, that
is, precancerous lesions that may develop into CRC, and
that the microbiota is a risk factor for cancer develop-
ment.4 5 Increased bacterial diversity has been reported
in the microbiota of patients with colon adenomas and
tumours
compared
with
non-CRC
controls.6–8
The
CRC-associated microbiota also has a microbial profile
distinct from healthy tissue, including bacteria that
thrive in the cancer-related microenvironment. The pro-
liferation
of
carcinoma-associated
taxa
such
as
Fusobacterium in tumours is a potential microbial bio-
marker of a dysbiotic microbiota in CRC.8 9 This micro-
bial
dysbiosis
may
reduce
the
regulatory effect
of
commensal
bacteria
on
cell
proliferation
in
colon
mucosa and contribute to the development of aden-
omas.10 It is plausible that dietary changes or interven-
tion with probiotic bacteria may reduce the risk of CRC
development; however, it is not known whether specific
tumour-associated
alterations
in
the
microbiota
are
modifiable in patients who manifest disease.
Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that,
when administered in adequate amounts, confer a
health benefit on the host.11 Studies have demonstrated
beneficial effects of probiotic bacteria on reducing CRC
tumour development and mucosal inflammation in
animal models; however, supporting clinical data in
humans are limited.12 To investigate the potential of
altering the microbiota in patients with colon cancer, we
conducted
a
prospective
intervention
study
using
selected probiotic strains. The bacterial strains used in
this
study,
Lactobacillus
acidophilus
NCFM
and
Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04, have a long
history of safe use as commercial probiotics and docu-
mented health benefits. NCFM has shown efficacy for
colonic tumour growth attenuation in rodents and was
associated with reduced levels of procarcinogenic metabo-
lites in the human gut.13 14 Bl-04, although less studied
with relation to CRC, has anti-inflammatory properties
and was shown to alleviate colitis in mouse models.15 In
this pilot study, we obtained intestinal tissue and faecal
samples from patients with colon cancer that received or
did not receive probiotics, and from non-cancer controls,
to characterise the colon cancer-associated microbiota
and determine whether this signature could be altered by
probiotic intervention.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study outline
Samples were obtained from patients with colon cancer at
colonoscopy and at surgery, and the colonic microbiota was
studied in a prospective manner (figure 1). Patients
without cancer or adenomas at colonoscopy were included
as controls for comparisons of baseline data. In addition, a
prospective randomised intervention with probiotics in
patients with colon cancer was carried out (figure 1). The
study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board
in Gothenburg under study number 233-10 and registered
at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT03072641). Informed consent
was obtained from all study subjects.
Non-cancer controls
Twenty-one non-cancer controls were included in the
study (table 1). Colonoscopy was performed due to
abdominal symptoms such as diarrhoea, constipation,
abdominal pain, or lower gastrointestinal bleeding and
iron-deficient anaemia. The prerequisites for inclusion
into the control group were a normal-appearing colonic
mucosa. Study subjects with significant pathology such as
colonic polyps, inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy
or ischaemic colitis were excluded. Microscopic colitis
was ruled out by light microscopic examination of biopsy
specimens
obtained
from
the
mid-portion
of
the

 ascending and sigmoid colon. The presence of colonic
diverticula was accepted provided there were no signs of
acute
diverticulitis
or
diverticulosis-associated
colitis.
Study subjects who received recent antibiotic therapy or
consumed probiotics regularly were also excluded.
Colon cancer patients
Fifteen patients who were diagnosed with stage I–III
colon cancer at colonoscopy were included in the study
(table 1). Tumours were classified according to the
tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system.16 The
prerequisite for inclusion into the colon cancer group
was the presence of at least one malignant tumour in
the colon and ≥18 years of age. Study subjects that had
adenomas, received recent antibiotic therapy or con-
sumed probiotics regularly were excluded.
Probiotic intervention
Patients with cancer were randomised to receive (n=8)
or not to receive (n=7) probiotic supplementation. The
intervention started at the second revisit to the clinic
and continued until the day of surgery (average length
of intervention was 31±28 days; range 8–78 days). The
probiotic supplementation consisted of two ProBion
Clinica (Wasa Medicals AB, Halmstad, Sweden) tablets,
yielding a daily dose of 1.4×1010 CFUs Bifidobacterium
lactis Bl-04 (ATCC SD5219), 7×109 CFUs Lactobacillus acid-
ophilus NCFM (ATCC 700396) and 0.63 g inulin. Flow
cytometry analysis showed that on average 85% of cells
were live cells with non-compromised cell membranes.
The tablets were produced using a low-compression tech-
nique which results in greater cell survival during produc-
tion and prolonged stability compared with conventional
techniques. In addition to a slow-release profile (150–
180 min), the tablets improve survival of the probiotic
bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract.
Tissue and faecal sample collection
In controls, tissue samples were obtained from the mid-
portion of the ascending colon (right side samples) and
the sigmoid colon (left side samples) using regular
biopsy forceps. One of these samples was used for ana-
lysis. In patients with colon cancer, biopsies were taken
during colonoscopy from the tumour as well as from
normal-appearing mucosa distant from the tumour.
There were no complications related to the colonoscopy
or biopsy procedures. Faecal samples were obtained post
colonoscopy and frozen at −80°C within 24 hours. All
participants attended colonoscopy and provided a base-
line faecal sample. Thereafter the patients with colon
cancer were randomised to receive, or not receive, pro-
biotics and eventually attended surgery. At surgery,
tumour tissue, macroscopically normal mucosal samples
obtained 10 cm from tumours, and faecal samples were
obtained, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
−80°C until analysis. Owing to healthcare procedures,
the timing between colonoscopy and faecal sample
donation or randomisation and surgery (ie, length of
intervention)
could
not
be
controlled
beforehand.
Hereafter non-tumour biopsies taken from patients with
colon cancer and control participants are referred to as
mucosa and control samples, respectively.
DNA isolation and 16S rRNA gene sequencing

with
OneStep-96 PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research,

ment with Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life T

analysed by targeted PCR amplification of the V4 variable
region of the 16S rRNA gene of bacteria and archaea.
Microbial DNA was amplified in triplicate PCR with
primers
515F
(5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA)
and
806R (5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT) as described.19 20
The PCR amplification proceeded at 95°C for 3 min for
initial denaturation, followed by 30 cycles at 95°C for 45 s,
55°C for 60 s and 72°C for 90 s; and final extension of

 Analysis of microbiota composition
Sequence analysis was conducted with the Quantitative
Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME V.1.9.1) bioinfor-
matics pipeline.21 Reads were paired using fastq-join22 and
those with a Phred quality score <20 were discarded. An
open reference scheme with uclust23 was used for cluster-
ing reads into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at
97% sequence similarity, such that OTUs not matching a
reference sequence in the Greengenes database24
25
(V.13.8) were clustered de novo. Python nearest alignment
space termination tool (PyNAST)26 was used for sequence
alignment, and a taxonomic tree was constructed with
FastTree-2.27
OTUs
containing
<5
sequences
were
removed. After quality filtering, 11 276 994 sequences
were retained, with an average of 99 796 sequences per
sample. Metrics for α-diversity (within-sample richness),
including observed OTUs and phylogenetic diversity
(PD),28 and β-diversity (pairwise dissimilarity) UniFrac dis-
tance29 were calculated on OTU tables rarefied to a depth
of 10 695 sequences.
Statistics and network analyses
Group comparisons for diversity metrics were conducted
within QIIME and graphed using Prism V.7 (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, California, USA). α-Diversity compari-
sons
and
group
distances
for
β-diversity
(weighted
UniFrac metric) were generated with a non-parametric
t-test
using
1000
Monte
Carlo
permutations.
Discriminate taxa (>0.1% abundance) between groups
were identified with the Wilcoxon rank sum test in
QIIME. Adjusted p values controlling the false discovery
rate (FDR)30 are reported where appropriate.
A correlation network analysis was constructed for
tumour samples using the CoNet software31 for genus-
summarised abundance data and clinical factors of
disease
and
tumour
severity.
Pairwise
correlations
(Pearson and Spearman), Bray Curtis dissimilarity and
Kullback-Leibler divergence were used to create an
initial association network. The edgeScores randomisa-
tion routine was used where row-wise permutations were
calculated with 100 iterations and the 1000 highest and
lowest scoring edges were retained. Renormalisation
option was enabled. A second network was created with
100 bootstrap iterations and merged into one final
network. The p values were merged using the Brown
option and adjusted with the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR
correction at a threshold of 5%. Only significant edges
supported by a minimum of two methods were retained.
The network was visualised in Cytoscape (V.3.1.1).
Heat maps were generated using a two-way hierarch-
ical cluster analysis with Ward’s minimum variance
method. Data were standardised across individual groups
by Z-scores, where group abundance was subtracted
from the population mean and divided by the SD in
JMP V.9 (SAS Institute Cary, North Carolina, USA).

however, no significant differences were found between
groups for faecal samples (data not shown; FDR>0.1).
β-Diversity
based
on
the
weighted
UniFrac
distance
revealed that the tissue microbiota was more similar
among patients with colon cancer within tumour or
mucosa biopsies than among control samples (figure 2C).
The microbiota composition from the mucosa adjacent to
the tumour was more similar to the tumour-associated
microbiota than to that of control samples (figure 2D).
For patients with colon cancer, α-diversity or β-diversity did
not differ between the tumour-associated microbiota and
the macroscopically healthy appearing mucosa-associated
microbiota sampled from the same patients at a distance
of 10 cm from the tumour (FDR>0.1).
Differentially abundant taxa in patients with colon cancer
compared with non-cancer controls
The overall composition of the microbiota was altered in
the patients with colon cancer compared with controls,
and the abundances of several taxa were elevated in
samples obtained from the tumour microenvironment.
The phylum Fusobacteria and genus Fusobacterium were
highly enriched in colon cancer samples (FDR≤0.05),
where the mean abundance was >7% in the tumour
tissue and <0.5% in control samples (FDR≤0.05; see
online
supplementary
table
S1
and
table
2). The
phylum
Euryarchaeota
and
genus
Methanobrevibacter
within were also enriched in colon cancer samples
(FDR≤0.05; see online supplementary table S1 and table
2). Several changes in faecal and mucosal microbial
composition were due to genera within the phylum
Firmicutes, despite there being no overall difference at
phylum level (table 2, see online supplementary tables
S1 and S2). Clostridium and Dialister were among the
genera enriched in the tumour and mucosa samples
from patients with colon cancer (FDR≤0.05; table 2).
Peptostreptococcus was significantly more prevalent in all
sample types derived from patients with colon cancer
(mucosa, tumour and faeces) (FDR≤0.05; see online
supplementary
table
S3
and
table
2).
Unclassified
Clostridiales and Oscillospira were elevated in the mucosa
and Selenomonas in the tumour from patients with colon
cancer (FDR≤0.05; table 2). Rikenellaceae spp (phylum
Bacteroidetes)
and
Bilophila
(phylum
Proteobacteria)
were also greater in the mucosa from patients with colon
cancer, while Streptococcus was depleted (FDR≤0.05, table
2). When faecal samples from the controls and patients
with colon cancer post colonoscopy (no intestinal cleans-
ing procedure included) were compared, Clostridiaceae spp
and Dorea, in addition to Peptostreptococcus, were more
abundant in the colon cancer group while T
enericutes
(phylum) and Roseburia were reduced (FDR≤0.05; see
online supplementary table S2).
Microbial interactions in colon cancer tumour tissue
To explore the complex microbial interactions in the
tumour tissue, we constructed a correlation network to
identify patterns of co-occurring microbes. The resulting
network contained 61 nodes and 350 significant edges
between microbial genera (figure 3A). Based on the
clustering patterns observed, groups of co-occurring taxa
within the tumour microbiota were evident. Subsetting
the edges that corresponded to tumour-enriched genera
showed that several of these taxa co-occurred within the
same samples (figure 3B). Fusobacterium, the most over-
represented genus in tumour samples, tended to co-occur
with
Peptostreptococcus,
Campylobacter
and
Bulleidia.
Peptostreptococcus and Selenomonas, also highly elevated in
tumour samples, were positively associated with each
other, as well as with Parvimonas and Mogibacteriaceae spp.
Conversely, tumour-associated Methanobrevibacter was nega-
tively correlated with both Fusobacterium and Selenomonas.
Correlation with host parameters of disease or tumour
severity did not reveal any substantive associations with
specific taxa, possibly due to the lack of dichotomy within
our cohort for these clinical factors (data not shown).
Probiotic intervention alters the colon cancer microbiota
Microbiota composition shifts with probiotic intervention
Cluster analysis revealed that the overall composition of
the microbiota in the mucosa and tumour samples from
patients with colon cancer that consumed the probiotic
differed distinctly from patients with cancer who did not
receive the probiotic, as well as from the non-cancer
control patients (figure 4). The mucosa from the
probiotic-supplemented patients with cancer was similar
in composition to the tumour tissue at surgery. A large
cluster containing several butyrate-producing bacteria
from the phylum Firmicutes was apparent in the patients
that received the probiotic, and was distinctly enriched
compared with the colon cancer patients that did not
receive the probiotic and control patients.
Butyrate-producing bacteria are enriched with probiotic
intervention
The overall abundance of the phylum Firmicutes was sig-
nificantly increased at the time of surgery in faecal
samples from patients with colon cancer that received
probiotic intervention compared with those that did not
(77% vs 63%; FDR≤0.05) (see online supplementary
table
S4).
Within
the
Clostridiales,
several
butyrate-
producing genera were consistently elevated in the dif-
ferent sample types from the patients that received the
probiotic (table 3). Clostridiales spp and Faecalibacterium
were enriched in all sample types obtained from patients
that received the probiotic (p≤0.05, FDR not significant).
Eubacterium was elevated in faecal and mucosa samples,
and Roseburia and Lachnospira were greater in mucosa and
tumour samples in patients that received the probiotic
(p≤0.05, FDR not significant). The CRC-associated taxa,
Fusobacterium and Peptostreptococcus, were less abundant in
patients that received the probiotic, but this was only
detected in faecal samples (p≤0.05, FDR not significant)
(table 3). For bacteria that were enriched in the patients
with colon cancer that received probiotics, we did not

DISCUSSION
Interactions between the intestinal microbiota and CRC
may be bidirectional, where a dysbiotic microbiome pro-
motes carcinogenesis, or possibly the tumour micro-
environment
and
related
inflammatory
state
cause
microbial dysbiosis.32 33 Our results establish that a dis-
tinct microbial community exists in the colonic tumour
and adjacent mucosa, which was characterised in our
study by increased microbial diversity and the differen-
tial abundance of numerous bacterial groups compared
with non-cancer control samples. A corresponding dif-
ferential clustering of CRC-associated mucosal microbio-
tas from those of healthy volunteers has been reported
in several 16S rRNA-based sequencing analyses, although
it was not always linked to increased α-diversity.8 32 34 35
The enrichment of microbial diversity in CRC tumour
tissue contrasts with trends of greater diversity typically
observed in microbiota samples derived from healthy
populations. Putative explanations for the increased
diversity in CRC tumour tissue are that the nutrient-rich
microenvironment may support a more diverse consor-
tium of microbial species8 or that it represents a transi-
ent state during dysbiosis formation. This finding is
noteworthy considering that the increase in diversity was
not observed in colon cancer-derived faecal samples,
and therefore may signify that this feature is characteris-
tic of the tumour microenvironment.
The colon cancer-associated microbiota signature in
our study was characterised in part by increased abun-
dance of Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium, both genera
that contain opportunistic oral pathogens known to
cause
infections
such
as
periodontitis.
The
over-
representation of these typically oral-associated organ-
isms in CRC-associated samples is especially intriguing
and has been recently examined in the literature.36 37
Fusobacterium has several attributes that make it uniquely
adapted to the tumour-microenvironment, such as being
asaccharolytic, and it has been shown to accelerate
tumorigenesis and promote a pro-inflammatory environ-
ment.37 38 These organisms have been repeatedly asso-
ciated with CRC-associated microbiotas and therefore
have
been
proposed
as
microbial
markers
for
CRC.9 32 39 The consistency of data linking these specific
genera with CRC is substantial, considering the complex-
ity of the gut microbiome and differences in population
attributes, sampling and analyses methods across studies.
Specifically,
Fusobacterium
nucleatum,
Peptostreptococcus
anaerobius and Parvimonas micra have shown promise as
microbial CRC markers due to an increased relative
abundance of 132-fold, 37-fold and 41-fold, respectively,
among patients with CRC in a large cohort study (103
CRC patients and 102 controls analysed).9 We found
that Peptostreptococcus was increased in all three colon
cancer-associated sample types (mucosa, tumour, faeces)
and was not present at detectible levels in non-cancer
control samples. Similarly, Fusobacterium was elevated over
30-fold between tumour and control biopsies, supporting
the importance of these bacteria as potential CRC
markers. Additionally, we have shown that these CRC
tumour-associated organisms are positively associated and
co-occur within the same samples. Their known high cap-
acity to colonise the mucosa and form biofilms in the oral
microbiome may suggest that a similar mechanism of col-
onisation occurs in CRC. Oral commensals and pathogens
that are associated with CRC may act as dysbiosis-
triggering organisms,33 and further studies are warranted
to determine whether the origin of specific strains can be
linked between oral and CRC tumour sites.40

 Additional differentially abundant taxa over-represented
in colon cancer tumour and mucosa samples included
the phyla Tenericutes and Euryarchaeota as well as the
genus Methanobrevibacter. T
enericutes was found to be less
abundant compared with controls in faecal samples
suggesting the colon cancer association was localised to
the mucosal surface or that different organisms were
detected from this phylum between the sample types.
Both T
enericutes and Methanobrevibacter have previously
been associated with adenoma or CRC microbiotas, and

 the phylum Tenericutes includes parasitic pathogens
(Mollicutes) that have previously been suspected as causal
agents in other cancers.8 34 41 Methanobrevibacter has been
linked to a multitude of intestinal disorders, periodontitis
and CRC, although the mechanism of CRC association is
unknown.42 It was negatively associated with Fusobacterium
in our network analysis, suggesting a different mechanism
of involvement in CRC. Other tumour-associated genera
were from within Firmicutes (Selenomonas, Clostridium,
Dialister and Parvimonas); however, contradictory findings
have been published on their presence in adenoma and
carcinoma-associated tissue.5 34 The non-cancer controls
displayed the greatest amount of within-group variability
in microbiota composition; however, the increased abun-
dance of genus Streptococcus was evident in control partici-
pants’ biopsies relative to colon cancer. Streptococcus bovis
has previously been associated with CRC tumours,32 35 but
in our data this elevation appears to be primarily attribu-
ted to sequences related to Streptococcus thermophilus. It
could be interesting to further investigate whether S. ther-
mophilus may have protective properties in healthy popula-
tions or if it is solely depleted in patients with colon
cancer. The control patients were not diagnosed with
colon cancer; however, colonoscopy was performed due
to various gastrointestinal complaints with manifest symp-
toms, which may partially explain the high level of vari-
ability among their microbiota profiles.
Overall, the composition of the microbiota in samples
from patients with colon cancer that received probiotics
had a unique profile characterised by an increased
abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria in tumour,
mucosa and faecal samples compared with patients with
cancer who did not receive probiotics. Butyrate interacts
intimately with colonic epithelial cells as an energy
source for colonocytes and by modulating signalling
pathways. It plays a beneficial role in colon cancer by
inhibiting cell proliferation, reducing IFN-γ-mediated
inflammation and promoting cell apoptosis and tumour
suppressor gene expression.43–45 Clostridiales spp and
butyrate-producing
Faecalibacterium,
Roseburia
and
Eubacterium were enriched in samples obtained from
patients with colon cancer with probiotic intervention.
Despite the FDR-corrected p values not reaching statis-
tical significance, this finding was detected consistently
in tumour, mucosa and faecal samples. A depletion of
butyrate-producing bacteria in the microbiota has been
reported in patients with various stages of CRC progres-
sion,46–48 and butyrate’s tumour-suppressive properties
have been shown to be directly mediated by the gut
microbiota, further supporting its importance in CRC.49
Additionally, the faecal microbiota of patients with colon
cancer
taking
probiotics
had
reduced
levels
of
CRC-associated genera Fusobacterium and Peptostreptococcus
according
to
the
non-FDR-corrected
p
value.
This
finding is in accordance with a previous probiotic inter-
vention trial where supplementation with Bifidobacterium
longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Enterococcus faecalis
reduced
Fusobacterium
and
Peptostreptococcus
in
CRC
patients to a level comparable to healthy controls.39 As
these two genera are strongly associated with CRC micro-
biota in several studies, these results emphasise the value
of evaluating probiotics for CRC prevention and care.
Moreover, probiotics have also been shown to mediate
inflammatory responses, as Gianotti and colleagues
observed that the mucosal colonisation of probiotic
strain Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 was correlated with
reduced proliferation and modulation of specific den-
dritic cells in CRC.50 Unfortunately, we were unable to
achieve the level of sensitivity necessary to differentially
detect colonisation of our specific probiotic strains from
the native populations by qPCR in the mucosal samples
from this study (data not shown).
The difficulty in obtaining intestinal mucosal and
tumour samples as compared with faecal sampling for
microbiota analysis presented challenges in the study
design and sampling. Patients underwent bowel cleans-
ing prior to colonoscopy but no bowel preparation was
done prior to surgery, and the timing of the faecal
sample collection post colonoscopy was not controlled,
both of which may influence the microbiota profiles.
Additionally,
the
intervention
length
varied
among
patients as it would have been unethical to restrict the
time to their surgery. We therefore chose to focus pri-
marily
on
comparisons
among
samples
that
were
obtained either at the time of colonoscopy or at surgery.
In a future study, it would be preferable to more strin-
gently control participant groups, but we avoided this in
the pilot trial primarily for ethical reasons. Despite these
limitations, by obtaining tumoral, mucosal and faecal
samples, we assessed the colon cancer-associated micro-
biota by several comparisons: (1) tumour to mucosa
within close proximity; (2) the aforementioned to non-
cancer control samples; (3) colon cancer faeces to non-
cancer control faeces; (4) colon cancer probiotic inter-
vention to no probiotic intervention. Fewer differentially
abundant taxa were detected in the faecal microbiota
than the corresponding tissue microbiota, suggesting
that the tissue microbiota profile is more informative for
identifying putative microbial markers of colon cancer.
Bacterial adherence to the intestinal epithelium or
biofilm formation may have contributed to the differ-
ences
we
observed
between
the
tissue
and
faecal
samples, but tissue samples more likely represent organ-
isms that directly interact with host and immune cells
and are thus preferable to more easily obtained faecal
samples.
Peptostreptococcus,
however,
was
significantly
enriched in both tissue and faecal samples and shows
promise as a microbial CRC marker.
The results of this study support the hypothesis that
the colon cancer-associated microbiota can be manipu-
lated by specific probiotic strains, resulting in an altered
microbiota enriched with beneficial bacteria. Our study
provides evidence that microbiota modulation by probio-
tics could be considered as part of a therapeutic regime
for CRC patients. Further studies should be conducted
in a larger population to confirm these initial findings,

could also expand beyond the microbiota to include the
potential
influences
of
fungi

viruses
(virome) and microbial bioactive molecules on CRC
development. The interplay between diet, microbiota
and host in maintaining homeostasis is an important
consideration in therapeutic strategies for CRC, and ana-
lysis of the microbiome is a critical component in under-
standing how these complex interactions influence the
development and progression of carcinogenesis.
