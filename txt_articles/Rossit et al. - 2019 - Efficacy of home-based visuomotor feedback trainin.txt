ABSTRACT
Hemispatial neglect is a severe cognitive condition frequently observed after a stroke,
associated with unawareness of one side of space, disability and poor long-term
outcome. Visuomotor feedback training (VFT) is a neglect rehabilitation technique
that involves a simple, inexpensive and feasible training of grasping-to-lift rods at
the centre. We compared the immediate and long-term effects of VFT vs. a control
training when delivered in a home-based setting. Twenty participants were
randomly allocated to an intervention (who received VFT) or a control group (n = 10
each). Training was delivered for two sessions by an experimenter and then patients
self-administered it for 10 sessions over two weeks. Outcome measures included
the Behavioural Inattention Test (BIT), line bisection, Balloons Test, Landmark task,
room description task, subjective straight-ahead pointing task and the Stroke
Impact Scale. The measures were obtained before, immediately after the training
sessions and after four-months post-training. Significantly greater short and long-
term improvements were obtained after VFT when compared to control training in
line bisection, BIT and spatial bias in cancellation. VFT also produced improvements
on activities of daily living. We conclude that VFT is a feasible, effective, home-
based rehabilitation method for neglect patients that warrants further investigation
with well-designed randomised controlled trials on a large sample of patients.

 Introduction
Hemispatial neglect is a severe neurological disorder, classically defined as a failure to
respond to stimuli in the contralesional hemispace (Kerkhoff, 2001). Its clinical impact
is substantial with a third of patients showing signs of neglect even more than a year
after their stroke (Karnath, Rennig, Johannsen, & Rorden, 2011; Rengachary, He,
Shulman, & Corbetta, 2011) and with its diagnosis being a major predictor of stroke dis-
ability (Buxbaum et al., 2004 Gillen, Tennen, & McKee, 2005; Kalra, Perez, Gupta, &
Wittink, 1997; Katz, Hartman-Maeir, Ring, & Soroker, 1999).
In light of these figures, it is perhaps not surprising that, over the last 50 years, an
increasing number of cognitive rehabilitation techniques have been developed to
improve the recovery of neglect patients (for a recent review see Kerkhoff & Schenk,
2012), such as visual scanning training (e.g., Antonucci et al., 1995; Kerkhoff, 1998;
Lawson, 1962; Piccardi, Nico, Bureca, Matano, & Guariglia, 2006; Pizzamiglio et al.,
1992), limb activation training (e.g., Brunila, Lincoln, Lindell, Tenovuo, & Hamalainen,
2002; Robertson & North, 1992, 1993, 1994; Robertson, Hogg, & McMillan, 1998a; Robert-
son, McMillan, MacLeod, Edgeworth, & Brock, 2002; Robertson, North, & Geggie, 1992;
Samuel et al., 2000), sustained attention training (e.g., Robertson, Tegnér, Tham, Lo, &
Nimmo-Smith, 1995; Robertson, Mattingley, Rorden, & Driver, 1998b; Thimm, Fink,
Küst, Karbe, & Sturm, 2006), prism adaptation (e.g., Frassinetti, Angeli, Meneghello,
Avanzi, & Ladavas, 2002; Jacquin-Courtois, Rode, Pisella, Boisson, & Rossetti, 2008; Ros-
setti et al., 1998; Vaes et al., 2016; for a recent review see Newport & Schenk, 2012), neck
muscle vibration (e.g., Karnath, 1994; Karnath, Christ, & Hartje, 1993; Schindler & Ker-
khoff, 2004; Schindler, Kerkhoff, Karnath, Keller, & Goldenberg, 2002), caloric (e.g.,
Cappa, Sterzi, Vallar, & Bisiach, 1987; Rubens, 1985; Vallar, Sterzi, Bottini, Cappa, &
Rusconi, 1990) and optokinetic stimulation (e.g., Bisiach, Pizzamiglio, Nico, & Antonucci,
1996; Karnath, 1996; Kerkhoff, Schindler, Keller, & Marquardt, 1999, 2006, 2012; Pizzami-
glio, Frasca, Guariglia, Incoccia, & Antonucci, 1990, 2004). In addition, a range of new
stimulation techniques have been introduced recently spanning from galvanic-vestibu-
lar (Kerkhoff et al., 2011) and transcranial direct current stimulation (Sparing et al., 2009)
to transcranial magnetic stimulation (Cazzoli et al., 2012; Nyffeler, Cazzoli, Hess, & Müri,
2009; Song et al., 2009) and functional electric stimulation (Harding & Riddoch, 2009;
Polanowska, Seniów, Paprot, Leśniak, & Członkowska, 2009). Finally, the effects of
drug therapy (dopamine agonist rotigone, Gorgoraptis et al., 2012) and virtual reality
treatments (e.g., Kim, Chun, Yun, Song, & Young, 2011; Sedda et al., 2013) have also
been exploited.
Unfortunately, despite the diversity of the proposed techniques for neglect rehabili-
tation, a recent Cochrane review concluded that their effectiveness in reducing disabil-
ity and improving independence remains uncertain (Bowen, Hazelton, Pollock, &
Lincoln, 2013): there is no evidence for a generalisation of the effects to untrained
tasks or functional abilities, most of the effects are not long-lasting and most studies
consist of single-case studies or small group studies without an appropriate control
group. Moreover, most of the techniques are not easily translated into a clinical
setting as they are costly, time-consuming and demand a substantial commitment
from both patient and therapist, which is hard to obtain from neglect patients, as
they may also suffer from anosognosia (i.e., a lack of insight into their impairments,
Appelros, Karlsson, Seiger, & Nydevik, 2003). Therefore, neglect rehabilitation remains

 recommended for clinical implementation (Bowen et al., 2013). Nevertheless, significant
immediate effects in favour of cognitive rehabilitation vs. control treatments on standar-
dised neglect tests justify the need for further well-designed clinical trials (Bowen et al.,
2013; see also Cappa et al., 2005; Champod, Frank, Taylor, & Eskes, 2016; Cicerone et al.,
2005; Priftis, Passarini, Pilosio, Meneghello, & Pitteri, 2013).
Visuomotor feedback training (VFT) is a relatively unexplored technique for neglect
rehabilitation which involves simple exercises of grasping-to-lift rods at the centre.
Importantly, VFT is inexpensive, easy to apply and does not require patient insight
into the disorder, so provides all the hallmarks for future wide-scale clinical implemen-
tation. The training has its roots in the paradoxical finding that even though patients
with left neglect present large rightward biases when asked to point to a rod’s midpoint,
such biases are significantly reduced when they grasp that same rod to pick it up
(Edwards & Humphreys, 1999; Robertson et al., 1995; Robertson, Nico, & Hood, 1997).
It has been postulated that motor responses (such as grasping-to-lift a rod at the
centre) allow neglect patients to access visual information not available during percep-
tual judgements (such as pointing to the perceived centre of a rod) (Robertson et al.,
1995, 1997). In particular, it has been suggested that VFT may improve neglect symp-
toms via a “dorsal-to-ventral” visual stream recalibration, thus enabling action to ame-
liorate perception (Harvey, Hood, North, & Robertson, 2003; Robertson et al., 1995,
1997). In line with this, it has been repeatedly shown that despite their severe biases
in perceptual tasks neglect patients are able to reach and grasp objects even when posi-
tioned in their neglected field (Harvey et al., 2001; Harvey & Rossit, 2012; Himmelbach &
Karnath, 2003; McIntosh, Pritchard, Dijkerman, Milner, & Roberts, 2001, 2004; Rossit et al.,
2009a, 2009b, 2009c; Rossit, Fraser, Teasell, Malhotra, & Goodale, 2011a, 2011b).
To date only a couple of studies have tested the efficacy of VFT in ameliorating
neglect (Harvey et al., 2003; Robertson et al., 1997). In a first within-subject design
trial (Robertson et al., 1997) 16 neglect patients were asked to repeatedly grasp-to-lift
rods at the centre until they were satisfied that they had found the centre (VFT) and,
in a control condition, to grasp the centre of a rod without lifting it. Positive effects
were found (after VFT only) on line bisection and cancellation tasks up to 20 minutes
post-training after only nine trials. In another study (Harvey et al., 2003), the immediate
and long-term effects of a more intensive version of VFT were further explored in 14
chronic neglect patients. The VFT group (N = 7) was asked to grasp-to-lift rods at the
centre whilst patients in the control group (N = 7) grasped and lifted the right side of
the rod only. Thus both groups, performed grasp-to-lift actions and received the
same amount of training, but only the VFT group received concurrent feedback from
their action. Effects were measured before and after an experimenter and home-
based sessions and at a one-month follow-up. Patients in the VFT group improved in
one third of all neglect standardised tests after the two-day experimenter-led interven-
tion and in 46% of all neglect tests at one-month follow-up. As recently emphasised
(Kerkhoff & Schenk, 2012) these are promising results which deserve further
investigation.
In this study, we conducted a controlled trial of VFT in 20-stroke patients with chronic
hemispatial neglect. Our main goal was to assess the short and long-term effects on
standard neglect tests and critically also on ecological and daily life functioning
measures, the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) in particular. In addition, we sought to investi-
gate the effects of a more feasible protocol of VFT by reducing the number of training
sessions (Harvey et al., 2003). Following the latest health recommendations (SIGN, 2010)
NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION

 that more research is required on rehabilitation methods that target stroke patients
living at home, we explored whether VFT is effective when delivered at the patient’s
home. Finally, we also examined whether VFT effects were maintained after four-
months post-training, a considerably greater follow-up period than previous studies
(Harvey et al., 2003; Robertson et al., 1997).
Methods
Patients
Stroke patients with hemispatial neglect were recruited following incidental referrals by
staff at the Southern General Hospital (Glasgow, UK) who were informed that we were
aiming to recruit stroke patients with signs of neglect. Inclusion criteria were: stroke
lesions as identified by brain imaging report, hemispatial neglect symptoms (in line
bisection, BIT or balloons test (as in Rossit et al., 2009a, 2009b, 2009c; Rossit et al.,
2011a, 2011b; see also Table 1 for clinical/demographic data and neglect cut-offs),
ability to follow instructions and medical fitness to participate. Exclusion criteria were:
previous or concomitant neurological (e.g., brain tumour, dementia), visual (e.g., catar-
act) or motor (e.g., arthritis) diseases unrelated to the current stroke. In total 20 neglect
patients were allocated to an intervention group and a control group (see Figure 1 for
CONSORT flow diagram). The study was approved by the local NHS ethics committee
and patients provided informed consent according to the declaration of Helsinki II.
Neglect screening was carried out at the hospital while the rest of the trial was per-
formed at the patient’s home. If the time interval between the first neglect screening
(at hospital) and the baseline assessment (at the patient’s home) was longer than
two months, neglect measures (BIT, line bisection task and Balloons Test) were re-admi-
nistered to ensure that neglect was still present at baseline.
Design and treatments
To investigate the effects of the VFT we conducted a controlled prospective study using
a single-blind design: patients, carers and scorers of our outcome measures remained
blind to group assignment throughout the trial, except for the Stroke Impact Scale
(SIS). Here, in the majority of cases, the SIS (Proxy version) was rated by the patient’s
carer, except for 6 patients (P5, P7, P4, P9, P19 and P20) to which the scale was
applied by the experimenter, as there was no carer available. Before the trial exper-
imenters made up a randomised list, and then each consecutive patient enrolled was
randomly assigned to either intervention or control groups as determined in the
order of this list (complete/unrestricted randomisation) (Blackwell & Hodges, 1957;
Lachin, 1988).
The treatment involved repeated grasping and lifting of rods, using the non-paretic
(usually right) limb. Three wooden rods (1.1 cm diameter, 0.63 g in weight) of 50, 75 and
100 cm in length were used. Each rod was presented horizontally on a test mat (160 cm
x 30 cm) in front of the patient, with the middle of the mat aligned with the patient’s
body midline. In each rod-lifting trial, the rods were placed in different positions
(centre, 10 cm to the right or left of the centre) to reduce the possibility that patients
reached for rods according to a fixed external reference. At the beginning of each
rod-lifting trial, patients were asked to place one of the three rods on a respective

 position indicated on the mat (Figure 2). Patients in the intervention group were asked
to reach for and grasp the rod with a pincer grip (using the forefinger and the thumb)
and try to lift it up in its centre so that it would be balanced (Figure 2(a)); if they felt that
it was not balanced after lifting it, they could repeat the trial until satisfied. Feedback
was provided only from the tilting rod and the experimenter did not comment on per-
formance. Patients in the control group were instructed to simply reach for and grasp
the rod with a pincer grip (using the forefinger and the thumb) by its non-neglected
end (usually the right) and to lift it up from the mat on that side and place it back
down again (Figure 2(b)). In addition, both groups were instructed that whilst lifting a
rod they should not move it away (in depth) from its starting position indicated on
the mat. The order of the rod-lifting trials (rod size and position) was randomised
across sessions and patients. Neither the patients (nor the carers) knew whether the
exercises they were performing were part of the control or intervention treatment.
The treatment was delivered in two consecutive phases: experimenter-led and
self-led. Following baseline pre-treatment assessment, the experimenter-led session
was run for two consecutive times of approximately 30 minutes over two days.
Each experimenter-led session consisted of six repetitions totalling 54-rod lifts.
After the experimenter-led phase, the patient independently repeated the training
for 10 days [sometimes with the help of their carer (e.g,. spouse)], over a period
of two weeks (self-led intervention). Each self-led session consisted of 72-rod lifts

 (8 repetitions). While in hospital patients were encouraged to scan their neglected
side but after discharge no other rehabilitation was delivered to patients except
this study.
To ensure correct execution and monitor patient adherence to treatment, partici-
pants were given a sheet containing the order of all 72 trials (separate sheets,
for each of the 10 sessions) and were required to tick each trial they performed.
Furthermore, the experimenter also monitored performance via regular (at least two)
phone calls to the patients and their carers. An ANOVA revealed no significant
differences between the two groups in terms of the time elapsed (in months)
between baseline and experimenter-led sessions (mean = 1.6; SE = 0.2), experimenter-
led and self-led sessions (mean = 1.8; SE = 0.3) and self-led and follow-up sessions
(mean = 4.3; SE = 1.1).
Outcome assessment and measures
Each patient participated in four assessment sessions: baseline pre-treatment; after the
two experimenter-led sessions; after the 10 self-led sessions; and follow-up (at four
months post-treatment). To reduce learning effects the order of the outcome measures
was counterbalanced across sessions and participants.
The primary outcome measures administered at each session included neglect tests
[i.e., BIT conventional sub-tests (Wilson, Cockburn, & Halligan, 1987), line bisection
(Rossit et al., 2009a, 2009b, 2009c; Rossit et al., 2011a, 2011b) sub-test B of the Balloons
Test (Edgeworth, Robertson, & McMillan, 1998) and the Landmark Task (Harvey, Milner,

room description task (Frassinetti et al., 2002), a subjective straight-ahead pointing
task (Rode, Rossetti, & Boisson, 2001) and the secondary outcome measure, the SIS

denski, et al., 1999; Duncan et al., 2002; Duncan, Bode, Lai, & Perera, 2003 were also
administered. For the landmark task (Harvey et al., 1995) patients were presented
with 10 horizontal black lines (20 cm x 1 mm) that were already centrally transacted
by a vertical mark (6 mm x 1 mm), the landmark. Four lines had landmarks displaced
1 and 2 mm to the left and right of the true centre and the other six were positioned
in the true centre. The order of the lines was randomised across participants and ses-
sions. Lines were presented on individual sheets of A4 paper and subjects were
asked to point, with their non-paretic limb, to the end of the line closer to the landmark.
For the room description task (Frassinetti et al., 2002), patients were asked to
name 14 novel objects positioned in their living room, along his/her midline
(seven on the left and seven on the right. The position of the objects was random-
ised across sessions and patients. The patients sat in the centre of the room with
their back to one of the walls and were blindfolded until the start of the task. A
table, placed in the centre of the room in front of the patient contained eight
objects, four on the left and four on the right (glue tube, stapler, pencils and book-
lets). Additionally, along the left and the right side of the room, three objects were
positioned on each side (A3 posters, calendar and carton boxes). Patients were asked
to name the 14 objects and the experimenter took a note of the number of objects
reported on each side.
In the subjective straight-ahead pointing task (Rode et al., 2001), patients were blind-
folded and sat in front of a horizontal wooden board (87 cm length and 54 cm height,
located app. 40 cm from the patient). They were required to point straight-ahead from a
resting position while their head was kept aligned with the body’s sagittal axis by the
experimenter. Ten pointing trials were performed. After every trial the experimenter
registered the end-point of the pointing movement by marking its endpoint on a
response sheet of paper that covered the board. The response sheet contained a line
that indicated the centre of the board (invisible to the participant as he/she was blind-
folded), which was aligned with the patient’s body midline.
The SIS (UK version 3.0; Duncan, Wallace, Lai, Johnson, et al., 1999; Duncan,
Wallace, Lai, Studenski, et al., 1999; Duncan et al., 2002, 2003) was applied as a sec-
ondary outcome measure to assess functional disability. The SIS assesses the follow-
ing eight domains: strength of the contralesional limbs; contralesional hand function;
mobility; emotion; communication; memory and thinking; social participation and
activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living (ADL/IADL). In addition,
the scale contains a question to assess the individual’s global perception of stroke
recovery, which ranges from 0 (no recovery) to 100 (full recovery). The scoring of
the scale was conducted through a database (in Microsoft Access) provided on-line
by the Kansas University Medical Centre (http://www2.kumc.edu/coa/SIS/SIS_pg2.
htm).
The outcome assessment was performed by the experimenter (except the SIS)
who also delivered the treatment. However, all measures were scored by a treat-
ment-blinded researcher. The following dependent variables were computed for
each patient and session: an absolute mean line bisection error (deviation from
the centre in mm); a BIT total score; BIT spatial bias scores (the ratio of the difference

 in the number of targets found on the ipsilesional vs. contralesional side, to the total
number of targets found on the line, letter and star cancellation sub-tests of the BIT;
Gorgoraptis et al., 2012); normalised scores on each domain of the SIS; the lateralised
index score in sub-test B of the Balloons Test; the percentage of centred lines
reported as being shorter on the neglected side on the Landmark task; the mean
absolute displacement from the centre (in degrees) on the straight-ahead pointing
task; and the number of items reported on the neglected side on the room descrip-
tion task.
Statistical analysis
The data were analysed separately for all dependent variables with ANOVAs with the
factors Time (baseline, experimenter-led, self-led, and follow-up) and Group (interven-
tion, control). Due to the relatively small sample size and the resulting lack of power
of the between subject design, we also calculated a gain score for each dependent vari-
able (i.e., each session minus baseline, see also Mizuno et al., 2011 for similar analysis).
This allowed to us to compare the gain between the two groups, with the data adjusted
for each of the participant’s initial status. The α level was set at .05 (2-tailed) and pairwise
comparisons were corrected using Bonferroni adjustments. The effect size of partial η2
was also calculated for each variable (a large effect is represented by a partial η2 of at
least .138, a moderate effect by .059, and a small effect by .010; Cohen, 1988).

for each voxel in the intervention (B; N = 8) and control (C; N = 5) groups. Lesions were identified by a clinical
neurologist (K.M.), who was blind to the design, group assignment and purpose of the study. Lesions were
mapped onto 11 axial slices of a T1-weighted template, corresponding to the MNI z coordinates of −24, −16,
−8, 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 50, 60 mm using identical or closest matching transverse slices for each patient using
MRIcro software package (Rorden & Brett, 2000). Due to technical difficulties at the clinical facility, we were
able to obtain and map digital brain scans for 13 patients only (6 MRIs and 7 CTs) as the remaining digital
brain scans were either lost or corrupted. Please note however, that all brain scan reports were available and con-
firmed the presence of a stroke and its location for all our patients. The range of colour scale derives from the
absolute number of patient lesions involved in each voxel.

 on each outcome measure revealed no significant differences (see Table 2 for statistics).
Lesion analysis (see Figure 3) revealed that the two groups suffered lesions in similar
brain regions with maximum overlap in the insula and claustrum and supramarginal
gyrus white matter (damaged in 63% of intervention patients and in 60% of control
patients).
Line bisection
For the bisection error (Figure 4(A)), the effect of group was not significant (F(1,18)= 0.8, P =
0.377, partial h2
p = 0.04), but there was a significant effect of time (F(3,54)= 8.4, P < 0.001,
partial h2
p = 0.32) and a significant group x time interaction with a large effect size
(F(3,54)= 3.4, P = 0.025, partial h2
p = 0.16). Post-hoc tests revealed that the intervention
group’s bisection errors were significantly reduced at each session when compared to
baseline (mean difference experimenter-led vs. baseline: −31.3, p = 0.001; mean differ-
ence self-led vs. baseline = −29.4, p = 0.02; mean difference follow-up vs. baseline =
−27.5, p = 0.02), whereas for the control group all comparisons failed to reach significance
(mean difference experimenter-led vs. baseline: −3.6; mean difference self-led vs. base-
line = −10.3; mean difference follow-up vs. baseline = −8.6). In line with these results,
the gain scores revealed a significant effect of group, again with a large effect size
(F(1,18)= 4.6, p = 0.046, partial h2
p = 0.20): the intervention group presented a greater
gain (i.e., larger reduction) in their bisection errors when compared to the control
group (mean difference = −21.9 mm; Figure 4(B)). No significant effects of time (F(2,36)=
0.3, p = 0.767, partial h2
p = 0.01) or group x time interactions (F(2,36)= 1.1, p = 0.330,
partial h2
p = 0.06) were found for the bisection gain score.

 Behavioural inattention test (BIT)
For the total BIT score, there was a significant effect of time (F(3,54)= 16.2, p < 0.001,
partial h2
p = 0.47): all patients presented higher BIT scores at each session when com-
pared to baseline (mean difference experimenter-led vs. baseline = 17.7, p = 0.001;
mean difference self-led vs. baseline = 26.3, p < 0.001; mean difference follow-up vs. base-
line = 24.0, p < 0.001; Table 3). Moreover, after the self-led session patients also scored sig-
nificantly higher when compared to the experimenter-led session (mean difference = 8.7,
p = 0.016). Nonetheless there was no effect of group, despite a large effect size (F(1,18)= 3.2,
p = 0.092, partial h2
p = 0.15), and the group x time interaction was not significant despite
a moderate effect size (F(3,54)= 2.6, p = 0.059, partial h2
p = 0.13). In a similar vein, the BIT
spatial bias score (Table 3), showed a significant effect of time with a large effect size
(F(3,54)= 13.4, p < 0.001, partial h2
p = 0.43): there was a reduction in the spatial bias
between baseline and all the other phases (mean difference experimenter-led vs. baseline
= −10.5, p = 0.001; mean difference self-led vs. baseline = −12.1, p = 0.001; mean differ-
ence follow-up vs. baseline = −8.5, p = 0.005). However, and despite moderate effect
sizes, the effects of group (F(1,18)= 2.5, p = 0.131, partial h2
p = 0.12) and the group x
time interaction (F(3,54)= 2.6, p = 0.058, partial h2
p = 0.13) were not significant. Impor-
tantly though, the ANOVAs on the gain scores revealed significant effects of group
(with large effect sizes) both for the total (F(1,18)= 6.7, p = 0.018, partial h2
p = 0.27) and

Compared
to
the
control group, the intervention group had greater gains on the BIT total score (mean
difference = 18.1; see Figure 4(C)) and on the spatial bias score (mean difference =
−8.8%; see Figure 4(D), here reflected as a reduction in error). No significant effects
of time or group x time interactions were observed for the total (F(2,36)= 2.3, p =
0.111, partial h2
p = 0.11; F(2, 36) = 0.4,
p = 0.675, partial h2

p = 0.09; F(2, 36) = 0.71, p = 0.497,

p = 0.04).
Stroke impact scale (SIS)
The ANOVAs performed in each SIS domain revealed significant effects for the ADL/
IADL, hand function and global perception of stroke recovery domains (see Table 3
for descriptive for all SIS domains).
For the ADL/IADL score (Figure 5(A)), the group x time interaction was significant
with a large effect size (F(2,32) = 5.1, p = 0.01, partial h2
p = 0.24) although the effects
of time or group were not (F(2,32) = 2.8, p = 0.077, partial h2
p = 0.15; F(1, 16) = 0.05,
p = 0.829, partial h2
p = 0.00). As can be seen in Figure 5(A), albeit post-hoc tests
not being significant, the control group presented higher scores after the self-led
session when compared to baseline (mean difference = 10.7, p = 0.05), whereas the
intervention group presented higher scores at follow-up than baseline (mean differ-
ence = 10.8, p = 0.06). Similarly, for the ADL/IADL gain scores there were no effects
of
time
or
group
(F(1,16) = 0.05,
p = 0.823,
partial h2
p = 0.00; F(1, 16) = 0.03,
p = 0.858, partial h2
p = 0.00), but there was significant group x time interaction
with a large effect size (F(1,16)= 9.0, p = 0.008, partial h2
p = 0.36). Post-hoc tests showed
that at follow-up, when compared to the self-led session, the control group significantly
deteriorated (mean difference = −10.2, p = 0.036) whilst the intervention group did not
deteriorate but their gain increased marginally (mean difference = 8.7, p = 0.067).
For the hand function score (Figure 5(B)), there were no significant effects of time or
group
(F(1,17) = 1.01,
p = .328,
partial h2
p = 0.06; F(1, 17) = 0.03, p = 0.867,
partial h2
p = 0.00), but the group x time interaction was significant and had a large
effect size (F(1,17)= 9.7, p = 0.006, partial h2
p = 0.36). Post-hoc tests revealed that the
intervention group scores were significantly higher at follow-up compared to the self-
led session (mean difference = 9.4, p = 0.01), whereas for the control group this differ-
ence was not significant (mean difference = 4.8, p = 0.14). However, no significant
group differences were observed for the hand function gain score (group: F(1,17) =

partial h2
p = 0.29): the lateralised index score was reduced at each phase when com-
pared to baseline (mean difference exp-led vs. baseline = 12.9, p = 0.02; mean difference

Landmark, subjective straight-ahead and room description tasks
For the landmark task, only the main effect of time was significant (F(3,54)= 2.8, p = 0.046,
partial h2
p = 0.14), but post-hoc tests did not reach significance. In addition, no signifi-
cant main effect of group (F(1,18) = 0.026, p = 0.873, partial h2
p = 0.00) or group x time
interaction (F(3,54)= 0.653, p = 0.585, partial h2
p = 0.03) were observed. In line with
this, no significant group effects were observed for the landmark task gain score
(group:

p = 0.04;
time:

no significant effects were observed for either the raw or gain scores of subject
straight-ahead and room description tasks so for brevity these are not reported here
but full descriptive statistics can be found in Table 3.
Discussion
This study demonstrates, for the first time, that visuomotor feedback training (VFT), a
simple training of grasping-to-lift rods, yields a significant improvement of hemispatial
neglect, which was observed after just one hour of training and persisted for at least
four-months post-training. VFT produced long-term improvements not only in line
bisection but, notably, the training effects generalised to untrained tasks, including
visual search tasks. Moreover, while the control group deteriorated in ADL/IADL at
follow-up the VFT group did not, and instead marginally improved. Notably, the
present findings show that visuomotor feedback training produces long-lasting
neglect improvements even when applied in a reduced fashion (fewer sessions and
trials) and on more severely impaired patients (lower baseline BIT scores than previous
14
S. ROSSIT ET AL.
 studies), thus highlighting the feasibility of this technique to be applied in a real-clinical
environment and justifying further larger RCT trials to confirm these results.
Improvements associated with treatment
In particular, we found that visuomotor feedback training produced significant short-
and long-term improvements in line bisection performance, a result we were hoping
for, as this test can be considered to be most similar to the training procedure.
In terms of the BIT effects, significant improvements were found for all patients but,
importantly, these improvements were much greater in the intervention than in the
control group. In particular, treatment with visuomotor feedback training was associ-
ated with a significantly greater gain in BIT and spatial bias scores (here reflected in a
greater reduction in the pathological spatial bias towards the neglected field in cancel-
lation sub-tests). The effects were maintained until the four-months follow-up and
found on the most widely used visual search tests to detect neglect in clinical settings
(i.e., BIT).
Moreover, visuomotor feedback training also had an effect in the SIS ADL/IADL
domain at four-months post-training: the VFT group marginally improved in ADL/
IADL whilst the control group deteriorated significantly. Even though this effect will cer-
tainly need to be replicated in a larger study, we believe that it is quite encouraging, as
the ADL/IADL domain assesses important aspects of the patient’s daily routine (such as
eating, dressing, personal hygiene and social activities) and for most patients the SIS
was rated by a carer who was blind to group assignment. The fact that the improve-
ments in hand function and ADL/IADL emerged only at four-months post-training,
and not immediately after the training sessions, may reflect a late consolidation of learn-
ing after training (see also Harvey et al., 2003). Alternatively, the fact the SIS was admi-
nistered by a carer in 14 patients might have hindered the results, as there is evidence
that proxies tend to score patients more severely on the SIS than when responses are
given by patients themselves (Carod-Artal, Coral, Trizotto, & Moreira, 2009). Neverthe-
less, the present findings suggest that the SIS is sensitive to both the impact of
neglect on daily life functioning and to rehabilitation outcomes. In fact, no previous ran-
domised control study has reported such long-lasting improvements in a functional
rating scale in neglect rehabilitation studies.
A final finding from this study is that the intervention group significantly ameliorated
their score on the SIS hand function domain at follow-up (yet only when compared to
the self-led session), whilst the control group scores remained unchanged (yet the gain
scores did not yield group differences). The SIS hand function domain assesses the
patient’s ability to use their impaired hand in functional daily life tasks (such as
turning doorknobs, opening a can and picking up small objects). The observation
that visuomotor feedback training (involving actions with the non-paretic limb) pro-
duced a small hand function amelioration may be because this training improved the
patients’ ability to find items on the neglected side (including their paretic hand
which gradually increased their hand function). Admittedly, the lack of effects on
gain scores for hand function suggests that this finding may be weaker than all the
others we have reported and requires further investigations with larger sample of
patients.
These findings are promising given that, to our knowledge, this follow-up period is
the longest ever tested in a randomised controlled trial of neglect rehabilitation

 (although longer periods have been reported in studies lacking a control group, e.g.,
Rabufetti et al., 2013; Rusconi & Carelli, 2012). These improvements were demonstrated
using a randomised, single-blind, attention-controlled design in a group of 20 chronic
neglect patients and the intervention and control groups were not significantly different
at baseline. Therefore, the positive effects found here were specific to visuomotor feed-
back training and are not simply due to non-specific factors (e.g., amount of training or
attention received) or conventional rehabilitation therapy. In addition, even though the
effects were found with a relatively small sample size of 20 patients, it is important to
note that this sample size is still amongst the largest ever reported in any neglect reha-
bilitation trial, including very recent studies by Kerkhoff et al. (2013, 2014) showing
promising results of “smooth pursuit” training on samples of 50 and 30 patients respect-
ively, and by Mizuno et al. (2011) reporting prism adaptation effects in ADL on a sample
of 38 patients.
Outcome measures not affected by treatment
It should be noted that despite the improvement found in the BIT cancellation sub-tests,
we did not observe any significant effects of visuomotor feedback training on our other
visual search task, the Balloons task, replicating Harvey et al. (2003)’s observation. Poss-
ible reasons for this discrepancy might be related to the different sensitivity or task
requirement of these tests (for a review of the effects of task demands on neglect
and extinction see Bonato, 2012).
Moreover, even though significant short- and long-lasting improvements were
observed in the line bisection task, no effects were apparent on the landmark test.
However, Harvey et al. (2003)’s effects on the landmark task were immediate and
were found using the perceptual version of the Landmark task, whereas here we
tested the effects on the motor version of the landmark task (i.e., instead of making a
perceptual judgement patients were asked to point to the side of line that was
shorter). It is thus possible that visuomotor feedback training only affects the perceptual
distortion present in neglect patients and not the pre-motor deficits, but future studies
will be required to investigate this possibility.
In line with previous findings (e.g., Pisella, Rode, Farnè, Boisson, & Rossetti, 2002;
Rode et al., 2001), most of our patients presented a marked ipsilesional shift at base-
line in the subjective straight-ahead pointing task. However, in contrast to studies
using prism adaptation (e.g., Frassinetti et al., 2002; Pisella et al., 2002; Rossetti
et al., 1998; Sarri et al., 2008), visuomotor feedback training did not produce any
improvements on this measure. It is possible that prism adaptation produces
greater effects on this measure than visuomotor feedback training however, not all
patients’ biases improve after wearing prisms and not all patients adapt to the
prisms (Rousseaux, Bernati, Saj, & Kozlowski, 2006; Sarri et al., 2008; Turton, O’Leary,
Gabb, Woodward, & Gilchrist, 2010). In addition, straight-ahead pointing abnormalities
may not be exclusive to neglect patients and may not always correlate with other
neglect tests (e.g., Bartolomeo & Chokron, 1999; Chokron & Bartolomeo, 1997;
Farne, Ponti, & Ladavas, 1998). Furthermore, we also did not observe any improve-
ments in the room description task due to a clear ceiling effect as the performance
of our patient group was already close to normal at baseline. Thus whether visuo-
motor feedback training also improves tasks performed in extrapersonal space (i.e.,
outside the reaching space) remains to be determined. Finally there were no
16

 differential effects on the overall stroke recovery score but it is possible that this
measure may be too broad to reflect subtler changes.
Limitations of the study
Out of necessity, for six patients, the SIS was administered by the experimenter as no
carers where available and the experimenter was not blind to treatment allocation so
this a constraint of this study (see also above for discussion of carer vs. patient assess-
ment). Moreover, although patients recorded execution of every single trial on a sheet
during the home intervention and this was scrutinised after, there was no guarantee
that the procedure was in fact adhered to. In future trials it might be better to
monitor execution via small cameras/ mobile phones or possibly a wrist device that
would monitor rod lifts.
Future considerations
It has been suggested that VFT produces a “dorsal-to-ventral” visual stream re-cali-
bration (Robertson et al., 1995, 1997; Harvey et al., 2003), allowing action processing
to improve perception. It could thus be predicted that neglect patients who suffer
from damage to dorsal visual stream areas involved in reaching and grasping, such as
the superior parietal occipital cortex and intra-parietal sulcus (Culham, Cavina-Pratesi,
& Singhal, 2006; Rossit, McAdam, McLean, Goodale, & Culham, 2013), might not
benefit from the treatment. Alternatively, VFT may recruit spared dorsal visual stream
regions located in the undamaged hemisphere contralateral to the hand used to
perform the training. It is also possible that VFT and prism adaptation (Newport &
Schenk, 2012; Rode et al., 2015) recruit similar sensorimotor processes. Similarly to
what happens during prism adaptation, the patients correct their grasping position
until successful performance is achieved (i.e., the rod is balanced), a process known as
strategic recalibration in the prism literature (Newport & Schenk, 2012). Future larger
clinical trials involving neuroimaging will be required to establish the exact neural mech-
anisms behind VFT and for which patients this form of rehabilitation is most suitable for.
To sum up, VFT produces long-lasting improvements in stroke patients with chronic
hemispatial neglect. Importantly, we have shown that the effects are present even when
administered at the patient’s home, generalise to untrained visual search tasks and that
this training impacts on everyday behaviour. Although a larger single-blinded random-
ised controlled trial will be needed to replicate the present results, this study highlights
the promising potential of VFT for future large-scale implementation in the rehabilita-
tion of hemispatial neglect and its feasibility as a home-based intervention. In contrast
to most available techniques for neglect rehabilitation, VFT can be easily taught and
delivered in either an in- or out-patient setting, it is non-invasive, cost-effective (the
cost of the material is negligible), can be conducted by the patients themselves in
their homes and does not require patient insight into the disorder.
