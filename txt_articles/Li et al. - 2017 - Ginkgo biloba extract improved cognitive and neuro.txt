Purpose To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ginkgo 
biloba extract (GBE) in acute ischaemic stroke and its 
impact on the recurrence of vascular events.
Methods We conducted a multicentre, prospective, 
randomised, open label, blinded, controlled clinical trial 
enrollingpatients with an onset of acute stroke within 
7 days from five hospitals in China Jiangsu Province. 
Participants were assigned to the GBE group (450 mg 
GBE with 100 mg aspirin daily) or the control group 
(100 mg aspirin daily) for 6 months. The primary outcome 
was the decline in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
score at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were other 
neuropsychological tests of cognitive and neurological 
function, the the incidence of adverse events and vascular 
events.
results 348 patients were enrolled: 179 in the GBE 
group and 169 in the control group. With 18 patients lost 
to follow-up, the dropout rate was 5.17%. Admission 
data between two groups were similar, but in the GBE 
group there was a marked slow down in the decline in 
the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (−2.77±0.21 
vs −1.99±0.23, P=0.0116 (30 days); −3.34±0.24 vs 
−2.48±0.26, P=0.0165 (90 days); −4.00±0.26 vs 
−2.71±0.26, P=0.0004 (180 days)) compared with 
controls. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 
scores at 12 and 30 days, the modified Rankin Scale 
scores for independent rate at 30, 90 and 180 days, and 
the Barthel Index scores at 30, 90 and 180 days in the 
GBE group were significantly improved compared with 
controls. Improvements were also observedin GBE groups 
for Mini-Metal State Examination scores of 30, 90 and 180 
days, Webster's digit symbol test scores at 30 days and 
Executive Dysfunction Index scores at 30 and 180 days. 
No significant differences were seen in the incidence of 
adverse events or vascular events.
conclusions We conclude that GBE in combination with 
aspirin treatment alleviated cognitive and neurological 
deficits after acute ischaemic stroke without increasing the 
incidence of vascular events.

IntroductIon
Stroke is one of the leading causes of disa-
bility and mortality worldwide. Thrombolysis 
and intra-artery therapy, the only two effec-
tive strategies, are available to only a minority 
of patients with stroke due to the limited 
time window.1 However, a great many stroke 
survivors suffer from cognitive decline. 
One cross sectional study performed in 10 
countries found that the prevalence of post 
stroke dementia was approximately 30% 
determined by Mini-Metal State Exami-
nation (MMSE) <27.2 Cognitive decline 
after stroke can result in vascular cognitive 
impairment (VCI) and Alzheimer’s disease.3 
Thus effective and safe interventions are 
urgently needed to tackle this public health 
burden of stroke and VCI.
Ginkgo biloba is an ancient Chinese tree 
and its extract has long been used in China 
as a traditional herb for memory, depres-
sion, tinnitus and confusion.4 In the UK, 
Europe, Canada and the USA, Ginkgo biloba 
extract (GBE) is a commercially available 
food supplement available without prescrip-
tion. The ingredients of GBE are compli-
cated, and vary by age, cultivation source 
and gender of the Ginkgo biloba tree.5 
EGb761 is a well defined GBE, produced by 
Dr Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals in the 
early 1990s, which contains approximately 
24% flavone glycosides (primarily quercetin, 
kaempferol and isorhamnetin), 6% terpene 
lactones (ginkgolides A, B and C, and bilo-
balide), 0.8% Ginkgolide B and <5 ppm 
harmful ginkgoic acid. Most of the clinical 
trials to date have been performed based 
on the standardised EGb761.6 The Ginkgo 
ketone ester dispersible tablets produced 
by Jiangsu Shenlong Pharmaceutical Co 
include 44% flavone glycosides, 10% terpene 
lactones, 2.5% Ginkgolide B and <2 ppm 
harmful ginkgoic acid. The chemical struc-
tures and chromatograms are presented in 
the online Supplementary figure S1 and S2.

Hence the GBE in this study has more protective chem-
icals and less harmful constituents and is expected to 
exert a better therapeutic effect than EGb761.6
It is reported that EGb761 protected against isch-
aemic brain injury by scavenging free radicals, including 
superoxide radicals, ONOO-, OH• and NO•, and other 
lipid peroxide radicals.7–9 EGb761 can also suppress 
the activity of ACE, thereby inhibiting the contraction 
of small arteries, dilation of cerebral blood vessels and 
increase in cerebral blood flow.10 Despite the protective 
effect of GBE,11 there is still a lack of compelling evidence 
to recommend its use in the management of ischaemic 
stroke. Clinical trials focussing on the therapeutic effect 
of GBE in VCI are lacking.
In this study, we investigated 348 patients with acute 
stroke with the aim of evaluating the potential use of GBE 
in the treatment of ischaemic stroke and its secondary 
effects on cognitive decline. In addition, we evaluated the 
side effects of an oral dose of GBE 450 mg daily. We also 
provide more evidence for neurologists regarding the 
application of GBE.
Methods
Patients
This was a multicentre, prospective study approved by the 
ethics committee of the Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital 
of Nanjing University Medical School and registered 
in the clinical trial centre (ChiCTR-TRC-12002688). 
All data were obtained from five tertiary hospitals in 
the Jiangsu Stroke Research Collaborative Group in 
China. From August 2012 to June 2014, 348 patients 
met the inclusion criteria and were successfully enrolled 
in the study. All subjects or their statutory guardians 
provided informed signed consent. Inclusion criteria 
were: (1) age 18–80 years; (2) acute ischaemic stroke 
onset within 7 days, confirmed by CT scan or MRI, corre-
sponding to large artery atherosclerosis or small vessel 
occlusion type, according to the classification of the trial 
of Org 10 172 in acute stroke treatment (TOAST), and 
CT or MR angiography; (3) admission National Insti-
tutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 4–20; (5) 
first onset stroke or patients with recrudescent stroke 
with a legacy of a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 
of ≤1; and (6) willing to cooperate with the follow-up 
examinations. Exclusion criteria were: (1) history of 
intracranial haemorrhage or subarachnoid haemor-
rhage; (2) cardiogenic cerebral embolism confirmed 
by atrial fibrillation incentive, typical history, or by CT 
or MR; (3) low platelet count, antiplatelet contraindi-
cation or receiving other antiplatelet drugs during the 
study; (4) severe cardiac, hepatic or renal insufficiency, 
pulmonary infection, terminal stage of disease or phys-
ical disability; (5) severe mental or cognitive disorder 
and uncooperative with the study; (6) allergy sufferer, 
or known allergy to Ginkgo biloba; (7) participation in 
another trial within 3 months; and (8) other conditions 
not appropriate for this study.
study intervention
Participants were randomised to the GBE group (three 
daily doses of 150 mg Ginkgo ketone ester dispersible 
tablets, combined with a daily dose of 100 mg aspirin) or 
the control group (aspirin 100 mg daily) for 6 months 
after stroke onset, with a regular treatment strategy, 
including 
lipid 
lowing, 
antihypertension, 
glucose 
lowering and neuroprotection. The 450 mg dose of GBE 
was chosen based on medical instructions, and previous 
clinical studies suggested a dose–response relationship of 
up to 450 mg.
randomisation
Assignment to the GBE or control group was deter-
mined by a random allocation sequence generated by a 
computer random number generator. Randomisation 
was done at the Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing 
University, and each participant was assigned a batch 
number. All professional neurological investigators were 
uniformly trained and responsible for strictly executing 
the study protocol, monitoring serious adverse events 
and reporting to the study's Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB). To minimise the systematic error of a 
single blind trial, some neurological investigators were 
responsible for allocating suitable participants to random 
groups, and others, who were blinded to the treatment 
details, were responsible for the follow-up visits and data 
acquisition. All participants were blinded to the treatment 
assignment for the duration of the study. The primary 
centre conductor was responsible for monitoring serious 
adverse events and reporting the results to the data and 
safety monitoring board (DSMB). Study statisticians and 
the DSMB reviewed unblinded data for safety and effi-
cacy, but strict confidentiality of results was maintained.
study outcomes
The primary efficacy endpoint was a decline in the Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment (deMoCA) score (0–30) at 180 days. 
The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a neuropsy-
chological test evaluating cognitive executive function and 
has a higher sensitivity in screening for mild cognitive disor-
ders. This test was performed at admission, and at 12, 30 
and 90 days. Lower scores indicate a more serious degree 
of cognitive function impairment, especially executive func-
tion.
Secondary measures at admission and at 12, 30, 90 and 
180 days included the following:
1. NIHSS and mRS independent rate. The NIHSS 
score, measured from 0 to 42, was used to assess the 
clinical severity and functional ability of patients 
with ischaemic stroke quantitatively during the acute 
stage, with smaller scores implying better neurological 
function. The mRS score, measured from 0 to 6, was 
used to assess the clinical severity and functional ability 
of patients with ischaemic stroke, with the higher 
mRS independent rate (defined as an mRS score of 
≤2) implying favourable neurological function for 
follow-up.

2. The Barthel Index (BI) measured global function and 
the activities of daily living, with a total score of 100 
points (a higher score indicates more severe impair-
ment). 
3. A neuropsychological test of cognitive function was 
performed using the MMSE, which is more effective 
and convenient for patients with dementia with mul-
tiple domain impairment. The test has scores from 0 
to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive 
function;
4. Neuropsychological tests of executive function were 
performed using the Executive Dysfunction Index 
(EDI) and Webster's digit symbol test (WDT). High-
er scores for EDI and lower scores for WDT indicate 
more severe impairment of executive function.
5. The 
incidence 
of 
vascular 
events, 
including 
cerebrovascular events, within 1–2 years was also 
a secondary endpoint. Events included ischaemic 
stroke, 
cerebral 
haemorrhage, 
subarachnoid 
haemorrhage, 
transient 
ischaemic 
attack, 
cardiovascular events (coronary heart disease and 
myocardial infarction), pulmonary embolism, deep 
venous thrombosis, peripheral arterial occlusive 
disease and other vascular events.
These neuropsychological evaluations were administrated 
to all participants by professional neurological investigators. 
Adverse events were monitored throughout the study and 
hepatorenal function tests were administrated to all partici-
pants at 12, 90 and 180 days for safety evaluations.
statistical methods
All data were analysed using SPSS V.19.0 statistical analysis 
software (SPSS). To estimate the sample size, we conducted 
a pilot study (n=40). From previous studies, we hypothesised 
that the mean deMoCA values were −2.46±0.51 in the GBE 
group and −2.31±0.43 in the control group. Accordingly, 
a total sample size of 316 was needed for a power of 0.8 
(type II error 0.2, 0.05, two tailed). Because of the consid-
erable uncertainty, enrolment was extended to 348 patients 
(10% increment). A test for normality was performed 
using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Continuous variables 
are expressed as mean±SE for normal variables and medians 
(P25, P75) for non-normal variables. Categorical variables 
are expressed as a percentage. Intergroup differences were 
analysed using the independent t test for normal variables, 
the Mann–Whitney U test for non-normal variables and the 
χ2 test for categorical variables. Intragroup differences were 
evaluated using the paired t test. The significance level was 
0.05 by two tailed tests.

results
From October 2012 to June 2014, 348 patients were 
enrolled in the study: 179 patients (51.4%) receiving 
GBE combined with aspirin (GBE group) and 169 
patients (48.6%) receiving aspirin only (control group). 
Eighteen patients were lost to follow-up or had health 
problems, including six patients who left at the begin-
ning of the study (see figure 1). Hence 342 patients were 
included in the full analysis set and 330 were involved in 
the per protocol set. There was no difference between 
the two groups in baseline characteristics, including age, 
gender, history of stroke, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, 
coronary heart disease, hyperlipidaemia history, fasting 
blood sugar levels and hepatorenal function (table 1). 
Mean age was 64.53±0.76 years, and 67.80% were women 
in the GBE group. Mean MMSE and MoCA scores were 
22.60±0.45 and 18.79±0.51 in the GBE group, which 
were not significantly different from the control group 
(22.59±0.49 and 18.72±0.54, P>0.05 vs controls). In addi-
tion, baseline NIHSS, independent mRS rate, EDI and 
WDT in the GBE group were similar to those in the 
control group (P>0.05).
Primary efficacy measures
Cognitive and executive function
As shown in figure 2A, MoCA scores after 12, 30, 90 
and 180 days were overall higher in the GBE group 
than in controls. A statistically significant difference was 
detected in deMoCA, indicating that GBE combined with 
aspirin treatment may promote MoCA improvement, 
mainly at 30, 90 and 180 days (mean deMoCA in GBE 
group vs control group: −2.77±0.21 vs −1.99±0.23 at 30 
days, P=0.0116; −3.34±0.24 vs −2.48±0.26 at 90 days, 
P=0.0165; −4.00±0.26 vs −2.71±0.26 at 180 days, P=0.0004) 
(figure 2B).
secondary efficacy measures
Neurological function and global function
At 12 and 30 days after treatment, significant differences 
were seen between the GBE and control groups for 
NIHSS scores and decline in NIHSS scores compared 
with baseline (deNIHSS) (median NIHSS: 3 (2, 5) vs 4 
(2, 6) at 12 days, P=0.0077; 2 (1, 4) vs 3 (1, 4) at 30 days, 
P=0.0015; Median deNIHSS: 2 (1, 3) vs 2 (0, 3) at 12 
days, P=0.0123; 3 (2, 5) vs 3 (2, 4) at 30 days, P=0.0037) 
(figure 3A, B). These data demonstrate a favourable 
improvement in neurological deficit function with GBE 
treatment from acute ischaemic stroke onset to 1 month. 
Also, as shown in figure 4A, B, independent mRS rate 
(attainment of mRS ≤2) and mRS scores were signif-
icantly improved in the GBE group compared with the 
control group from 30 to 180 days of follow-up. These 
data indicate better global functional outcome in the 
GBE group (independent mRS rate: 73.68% vs 59.75% at 
30 days, P=0.0072; 84.80% vs 71.70% at 90 days, P=0.0038; 
90.64% vs 78.62% at 180 days, P=0.0023). BI scores reflect 
activities of daily living. The study found an improvement 
in mean BI scores at 30, 90 and 180 days in the GBE group 
(mean BI: 80.85±1.58 vs 75.46±1.88 at 30 days, P=0.0279; 
87.42±1.34 vs 80.96±1.76 at 90 days, P=0.0034; 90.56±1.15 
vs 84.95±1.51 at 180 days, P=0.0031). However, these 
improvements were not significantly different from those 
in the control group (figure 3C, D).

shown in figure 5E, WDT scores were improved slightly 
after treatment in both groups, with the GBE group 
showing the most improved trend. However, the differ-
ences in WDT and deWDT values were not considered 
significant, except at the 30 day evaluation (mean deWDT:

Incidence of vascular events
We evaluated the recurrence of vascular events for nearly 
2 years. A total of 339 of the 348 patients completed the 
last telephone call follow-up in April 2015. As shown in 
table 2, 36 patients (10.6%) had vascular events—16 in the 
GBE group (9.1%) and 20 in the control group (12.3%)—
but there was no significant difference in the incidence 
of vascular events. In the GBE group, 13 reported

cerebrovascular events, including 9 recurrent strokes and 
4 transient ischaemic attacks. Three patients reported 
cardiovascular events, one had an aortic dissecting aneu-
rysm and one had both transient ischaemic attacks and 
cardiovascular events (atrial fibrillation). In the control 
group, 14 recurrent strokes, 2 transient ischaemic attacks, 
3 cardiovascular events and 1 intestinal obstruction were 
reported. Five patients (1.5%) died before the end of the 
study, including one death due to recurrent stroke and 
one death due to intestinal obstruction in the control 
group, and three deaths of unknown cause (the families 
declined to disclose) in the GBE group.
safety analysis
During the 6 month period study, 10 adverse events were 
reported. One vomiting episode was considered to be 
possibly related to the study; a recurrent stroke event and 
a pneumonia event were considered possibly not related 
to the study; four events, including myocardial infarction, 
nephritis, sick sinus syndrome and respiratory failure, 
were considered to be definitely not related to the study; 
and for two other events (diabetes mellitus and vomiting) 
the cause could not be ascertained. 
Adverse events were assessed at each visit from baseline 
to 180 days. As shown in table 3, the 10 adverse events 
(2.89%) in 346 patients included 5 in the GBE group 
(2.81%) and 5 in the control group (2.98%). No overall 
significant difference was reported between the groups 
(P=1.000). The rates of serious adverse events for the GBE 
and control groups were similar, including mortality and 
incidence of coronary heart disease, stroke of any type 
and major bleeding, with one in the GBE group (0.56%) 
and four in the control group (2.38%) (P=0.2032). The 
same was true for the laboratory evaluation and the eval-
uation of vital signs and concomitant medication. There-
fore, there was no indication of a safety risk associated 
with 450 mg/day GBE combined with aspirin.
dIscussIon
The aim of this initial randomised multicentre study 
was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of GBE on neuro-
logical deficit and cognitive decline after acute stroke 
injury. The study demonstrated that patients with stroke 
who received GBE manifested better memory function, 
executive functions, neurological function and daily life. 
Additionally, the safety data analysis demonstrated that 
GBE did not increase the incidence of adverse events.
Over 
the 
past 
decades, 
substantial 
evidence 
has supported the hypothesis that GBE protects against 
neuronal death caused by ischaemia in animal stroke 
models.12 The possible molecular mechanism may 
include anti-apoptosis13–15 and increasing cerebral 
blood flow.16 One double blind, placebo controlled, 
randomised controlled trial of 102 patients with isch-
aemic stroke concluded that regarding neurological func-
tion, the GBE group fared much better than a placebo 
group over a 4 month follow-up period.17 In the current 
study, 348 patients with stroke were enrolled with an 
extended follow-up time of 6 months. At 12 and 30 days, 
a significant improvement in neurological function was 
seen in the GBE group, in terms of mean NIHSS scores 
and decline in mean NIHSS scores (deNIHSS) compared 
with the control group. Similar improvements occurred 
in mRS scores at 30, 90 and 180 days. These data suggest 
that GBE is effective and could be recommended in the 
treatment of acute ischaemic stroke.
GBE can partially delay the progression of cognitive 
decline after stroke. In the current study, it was found 
that GBE may be a promising medication for patients 
with VCI. Regarding the therapeutic effect of GBE in 
dementia, the published literature is less conclusive.
Study designs can be divided into three categories: 
reduce the risk of developing dementia in older people; 
treat patients with dementia; and compare the effect of a 
strategy with other therapeutic strategies. In prophylactic 
studies, large scale clinical trials concluded that EGB761 
(240 mg daily) did not reduce progression to Alzheimer’s 
disease in older normal adults.18–20 Compelling evidence 
regarding dementia treatment is still lacking. A meta-anal-
ysis involving 15 randomised, placebo controlled trials 
and 2684 outpatients concluded that EGb761 is a poten-
tial option for patients with dementia with good toler-
ability and efficacy.21Compared with donepezil (5 mg 
daily) in the treatment of Alzheimer’s dementia, GBE 
(160 mg daily) showed comparable efficacy.22 Hetero-
geneity will require further scrutiny in GBE therapeutic 
trials. Differences in evaluation systems, GBE dosage

and administration time points likely contribute to this 
discrepancy. Data from the current study support the 
notion that GBE improves the cognitive function of VCI. 
Compared with previous published studies, the current 
study used higher VCI and GBE dosages (450 mg daily). 
Moreover, daily life in the GBE group was significantly 
better than in the control group, including BI score and 
EDI score. Overall, administration of GBE in patients with 
acute stroke is recommended for its ability to improve 
cognition and the quality of daily life.
In the current study, no significant differences were 
noted between the GBE group and the control group 
regarding the percentages of participants experiencing 
any adverse events. These results are consistent with 
most published studies.18 However, a randomised, 
placebo controlled trial conducted by Dodge et al 
reported that elderly patients (age >85 years) taking 
240 mg GBE daily experienced more incidences of 
ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack than 
people taking a placebo.23 These data indicate that 
patients older than 85 years should receive a lower dose 
of GBE. Additionally, a few studies have proposed that 
GBE may increase the risk of bleeding due to its inhi-
bition of platelet aggregation and platelet activating 
factor function.24 25 From 1966 to 2004, 15 case reports 
described the association between GBE and bleeding 
events, including eight episodes of intracranial 
bleeding.26 Among them, some patients had previous 
bleeding risk factors, including liver cirrhosis, hyperten-
sion and warfarin or high dose aspirin consumption.26 
As intracranial haemorrhage is a serious complication, 
sometimes leading to death, clinicians should be careful 
when giving GBE to patients with these risk factors. 
Patients with antiplatelet contraindications, low platelet 
count or liver insufficiency, and those taking other anti-
platelet drugs were excluded from the current study. 
The average patient age was 64.53±10.09 years. In the 
current study, even though patients were taking 450 mg 
GBE daily, a higher incidence of cerebrovascular events 
was not observed in the GBE group compared with the 
control group.
There were some limitations in this study. First, 
the study was single not double blinded, which may 
have caused some bias in the analysis and conclusions. 
Second, most of the efficacy parameters were based on 
clinical scales and thus research bias by researchers 
cannot be entirely excluded. Third, the follow-up 
period was not very long, and the effect of long term 
exposure to GBE should be verified in further inves-
tigations. Lastly, further larger trials are needed for 
subgroup analysis of the degree of stroke severity and 
cognitive function impairment.
