Summary
Background Viral meningitis is increasingly recognised, but little is known about the frequency with which it occurs, 
or the causes and outcomes in the UK. We aimed to determine the incidence, causes, and sequelae in UK adults to 
improve the management of patients and assist in health service planning.
Methods We did a multicentre prospective observational cohort study of adults with suspected meningitis at 
42 hospitals across England. Nested within this study, in the National Health Service (NHS) northwest region (now 
part of NHS England North), was an epidemiological study. Patients were eligible if they were aged 16 years or older, 
had clinically suspected meningitis, and either underwent a lumbar puncture or, if lumbar puncture was 
contraindicated, had clinically suspected meningitis and an appropriate pathogen identified either in blood culture or 
on blood PCR. Individuals with ventricular devices were excluded. We calculated the incidence of viral meningitis 
using data from patients from the northwest region only and used these data to estimate the population-standardised 
number of cases in the UK. Patients self-reported quality-of-life and neuropsychological outcomes, using the EuroQol 
EQ-5D-3L, the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), and the Aldenkamp and Baker neuropsychological 
assessment schedule, for 1 year after admission.
Findings 1126 patients were enrolled between Sept 30, 2011, and Sept 30, 2014. 638 (57%) patients had meningitis: 
231 (36%) cases were viral, 99 (16%) were bacterial, and 267 (42%) had an unknown cause. 41 (6%) cases had other 
causes. The estimated annual incidence of viral meningitis was 2·73 per 100 000 and that of bacterial meningitis was 
1·24 per 100 000. The median length of hospital stay for patients with viral meningitis was 4 days (IQR 3–7), increasing 
to 9 days (6–12) in those treated with antivirals. Earlier lumbar puncture resulted in more patients having a specific cause 
identified than did those who had a delayed lumbar puncture. Compared with the age-matched UK population, patients 
with viral meningitis had a mean loss of 0·2 quality-adjusted life-years (SD 0·04) in that first year.
Interpretation Viruses are the most commonly identified cause of meningitis in UK adults, and lead to substantial 
long-term morbidity. Delays in getting a lumbar puncture and unnecessary treatment with antivirals were associated 
with longer hospital stays. Rapid diagnostics and rationalising treatments might reduce the burden of meningitis on 
health services.

Introduction
As the incidence of bacterial meningitis decreases, the 
proportion of meningitis cases caused by viruses is 
increasing.1 The use of molecular diagnostics has also led 
to increased recognition of neurological viral infections.2 
The number of reports of viral meningitis and encephalitis 
in England and Wales was seven times higher in 2013 than 
in 2004.2 Enteroviruses and herpesviruses are commonly 
reported causes of viral meningitis in adults, but their 
relative incidences vary in different countries. Finland 
reports a high incidence of herpesvirus meningitis, 
whereas Spain has a pre 
dominance of enteroviruses.3,4
Identification of the cause of meningitis is important to 
improve clinical care, including reducing unnecessary use 
of antibiotics and antivirals. Patients with suspected viral 
meningitis are often treated with antibiotics while a 
diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is excluded, which results 
in patients receiving long courses of antibiotics and can 
extend their hospital stay.5 Although aciclovir, which has 
good in-vitro activity against many herpesviruses, is 
effective in encephalitis caused by herpes simplex virus and 
varicella zoster virus, its role in acute meningitis caused by 
these viruses has never been determined.6 Aciclovir has 
no activity against enteroviruses. Viral meningitis is 
traditionally con 
sidered a benign, self-limiting illness,7 but 
several reports suggest that this might not be the case.8–10
Recent trends in bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial 
meningitis in the UK have been published,11 but the 
clinical burden of viral meningitis remains unknown. 
We, therefore, did an observational study of adults 
admitted with suspected meningitis to determine the 
incidence, causes, and sequelae of viral meningitis.

Methods
Study design and participants
In this multicentre, prospective, observational cohort 
study, patients were recruited from 42 hospitals throughout 
England, including all 24 acute hospitals in the northwest 
region of England. Patients were eligible if they were aged 
16 years or older, had clinically suspected meningitis, and 
either underwent a lumbar puncture or, if lumbar puncture 
was contraindicated, had clinically suspected meningitis 
and an appropriate pathogen identified either in blood 
culture or on blood PCR. Individuals with ventricular 
devices were excluded. Case definitions are in table 1.
Written informed consent was obtained from patients. 
A personal consultee declaration was obtained from 
friends, carers, or relatives if a patient lacked capacity. 
Clinical data were recorded on a secure online database 
(OpenClinica; Waltham, MA, USA). Ethical approval 
was given by the North Wales Multicentre Research 
Ethics Committee (reference 11/WA/0218). Research 
governance approval was given at each hospital. The study 
protocol can be accessed online.
Estimation of meningitis incidence
Incidence rates were estimated by dividing the number of 
patients recruited in the northwest sites, in 1 year, by the 
total adult population of the same region. To estimate 
how many cases of meningitis had been missed in the 
prospective study, we did a retrospective review of 
laboratory records, spanning the first year of recruitment 
for each hospital, in four hospitals within the northwest 
(representing 
the 
variation 
in 
recruitment 
rates 
throughout the whole study—ie, the four hospitals 
included those with the highest, middle, and lowest 
recruitment rates). We identified cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) samples with a leucocyte count of more than 
4 × 10⁶ cells per L from laboratory records and classified 
them according to pathogen identified (or unknown if 
none was found). We applied a proportional inflation, 
based on the total number of cases (those recruited and 
those missed) divided by the actual number recruited into 
the northwest sites in the prospective study, to the initial 
estimated northwest incidence data. This estimate was 
then used to calculate the population-standardised 
number of cases in the UK. Using population data from 
the Office of National Statistics, the northwest adult 
population in mid-2012 was 11% of the UK population. 
Therefore, the national incidence data were derived by 
assuming that the incidence in the northwest was 11% of 
the national incidence. 
Outcomes
We assessed outcomes nationally. Clinical outcomes 
recorded included inpatient mortality and admission 
to a critical care unit. Patient-reported outcome 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
In the past 10–15 years, viral meningitis has been recognised 
increasingly, and can be a substantial cause of morbidity. Since 
the widespread introduction of conjugate vaccines against 
Haemophilus influenzae type b in 1992, Neisseria meningitidis 
serogroup C in 1999, and Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2002, 
the incidence of community-acquired bacterial meningitis has 
been declining. This decline, in combination with increased 
molecular testing, means that viruses are growing in relative 
importance as a cause of meningitis. Studies using historical 
data have also suggested changes in the causes of childhood 
viral meningitis over several decades.
We searched PubMed for “viral” AND “meningitis” AND 
“adults”, with no date or language restrictions. 307 publications 
were returned, of which 22 were cohort studies of the cause of 
meningitis. Several papers describe the varying causes of 
meningitis, but only one attempted to determine the incidence, 
in a cohort of Israeli soldiers. Another study attempted to 
report the national incidence of viral meningitis in the UK, but it 
only included laboratory-confirmed cases and did not 
distinguish between meningitis and encephalitis, the causes, 
treatment, and prognoses of which are vastly different. No UK 
study has examined the incidence and causes of viral meningitis 
in adults. The outcomes following viral meningitis are also 
unclear, although subtle sequelae such as neurocognitive and 
sleep disorders have been described.
Added value of this study
This study takes a unique approach that combines the benefits 
of a prospective clinical epidemiological study with 
laboratory-confirmed cases to estimate the incidence, causes, 
and sequelae of viral meningitis in UK adults. It is the largest 
clinical study of adults with viral meningitis reported to date 
and gives the first accurate incidence of viral meningitis, other 
causes, and those with no known cause. It also describes the 
substantial long-term impact that viral meningitis has on 
quality of life, especially in regard to memory and mental 
health.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our findings demonstrate that viruses are the predominant 
cause of adult meningitis in the UK, with enteroviruses and 
herpesviruses responsible for the majority of cases for which a 
cause is found. Combined with previous studies, this study 
shows that considerable geographical variation exists in the 
cause of viral meningitis across the world. We highlight the 
burden that viral meningitis imposes on the health system and 
suggest areas in which improvements could be made; a 
reduction in the length of hospital stays and an increase in 
meningitis cases with a causal diagnosis might be achieved 
through more rapid diagnostics. Additionally, we add to the 
literature suggesting that viral meningitis has effects long after 
the patient has been discharged.

measures were quality of life, neuropsychological 
functioning, and symptom resolution. Quality of life 
was measured using the EuroQol EQ-5D-3L13 and 
36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36),14 both of 
which are internationally validated. We also recorded 
the 
Aldenkamp 
and 
Baker 
neuropsychological 
assessment schedule (ABNAS)15 score and the total 
morbidity score, which was outlined in Desmond 
and colleagues’ study.16 Both of these scores were 
developed for neurological disorders—namely, epilepsy 
and meningitis (see appendix for questionnaires). 
EQ-5D-3L, SF-36, and ABNAS were assessed at 
6, 12, 24, and 48 weeks after admission. The total 
morbidity score recorded resolution of symptoms for 
3 weeks after admission. Quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) 
were 
calculated 
from 
the 
EQ-5D-3L. 
Population-level data for ABNAS are not available, so 
questionnaires were sent to family or friends of the 
patient to act as a control group.
Microbiological testing
All CSF samples were examined by microscopy and 
culture. CSF PCR was done in the admitting hospitals, 
regional diagnostic centres, or the University of Liverpool 
(UK), to test for herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, 
varicella zoster virus, and enteroviruses, as well as 
Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis, 
following national recommendations.17
Statistical analysis
We used t tests to analyse normally distributed 
continuous data. We applied appropriate transformations 
in the case of non-normally distributed continuous data. 
If the transformed data were still not normally 
distributed, we used Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis 
tests. We analysed categorical data by use of χ² or Fisher’s 
exact test. We calculated 95% CIs using Byar’s method.18 
To obtain a 95% CI for the UK incidence, we applied a 
proportional inflation to the northwest data based on the 
retrospective data collection. We used logistic regression 
to assess the association between time to lumbar 
puncture and getting a microbiologically proven 
diagnosis. We obtained the SF-6D, a single unit 
preference-based measure, from the SF-36, and we used 
non-parametric Bayesian analysis with permission from 
the University of Sheffield, UK.19,20 We applied a 
Bonferroni correction to the ABNAS domains, and a 
p value of less than 0·008 was considered statistically 
significant; last observation carried forward was used for 
missing data. We determined variables associated with 
symptom resolution in univariate analyses using log-
rank tests. We analysed data using SPSS, version 21.

the meningitis case definition (table 1). The cause was 
shown to be viral in 231 (36%) of 638 patients, and 
bacterial in 99 (16%) of 638 patients (table 2). 
Enteroviruses were the most frequent viruses, accounting 
for 55% of all viral meningitis cases (127 of 231 cases), 
being the single most common cause, accounting for 
20% of all meningitis (127 of 638 cases). 101 (44%) of 
231 cases were caused by herpesviruses (herpes simplex 
virus type 2 [n=52], varicella zoster virus [n=43], herpes 
simplex virus type 1 [n=3], Epstein-Barr virus [n=2], and 
cytomegalovirus [n=1]). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the 
most common bacterial cause, responsible for 53 (54%) 
of 99 bacterial cases, but only 8% of all meningitis cases. 
There were 29 cases of meningococcal meningitis 
(16 [55%] serogroup B, eight [28%] Y, one [3%] W, and 
four [14%] unknown serogroup). Four patients had 
cryptococcal meningitis (all HIV positive), and 11 had 
tuberculous meningitis. 267 (42%) of 638 patients with 
meningitis had no cause identified, and, of these patients, 
200 (75%) had a lymphocytic CSF (>50% lymphocytes), 
which was classified as lymphocytic meningitis of 
unknown cause and 41 (15%) had neutrophil pre-
dominance (≥50% neutrophils), which was classified as 
neutrophilic meningitis of unknown cause. The pre- 
dominant leucocyte type was unknown in 26 (10%) of 
267 patients with no identified cause. Clinical features 
are shown in table 3.
732 patients were recruited from the northwest sites 
throughout the whole duration of the study. Using both 
the prospective and retrospective data from the northwest 
sites, the incidence of viral meningitis was estimated to 
be 2·73 per 100 000 per year and that of bacterial 
meningitis 1·24 per 100 000 per year in UK adults 
(table 4). When all cases were considered, including 
those with no identified cause, the annual incidence of 
all meningitis in UK adults was 13·47 per 100 000.
901 (81%) of 1113 patients had neurological imaging, 
with the majority (776 [70%] of 1113) before lumbar 
puncture. Only 90 (12%) of these 776 patients had an 
indication for imaging before lumbar puncture, as 
recommended in national guidelines (ie, at least one of 
Glasgow Coma Scale ≤12, uncontrolled seizures, 
papilloedema, or focal neurological signs).21 The most 
common indications were a score of 12 or less on the 
Glasgow Coma Scale in 54 (7%) of 776 patients and 
seizures in 36 (5%) of 776 patients; five (1%) patients had 
papilloedema and eight (1%) had focal neurological 
findings. The median time from admission to antibiotics 
was 2 h (IQR 0–10 [n=23]) in patients who did not have 
imaging before lumbar puncture compared with 3 h 
(1–11 [n=563]) in those who did (p=0·004), and the 
median time from admission to lumbar puncture was 
8 h (3–22 [n=299]) in patients who did not have imaging 
versus 18 h (9–30 [n=776]) in those who did (p<0·001). 
The median time from admission to lumbar puncture 
was longer in patients with lymphocytic meningitis of 
unknown cause (21 h [IQR 9–38]) than in those

with proven viral meningitis (13 h [7–23]; p<0·001), 
proven bacterial meningitis (13 h [5–23]; p<0·001), and 
neutrophilic meningitis of unknown cause (15 h [7–23]; 
p=0·008). The median time to lumbar puncture for all 
patients was 17 h (IQR 8–29). The chances of having a 
pathogen detected in viral meningitis was reduced by 
1% for every hour of delay in lumbar puncture after 
admission (odds ratio [OR] 0·988 [95% CI 0·982–0·995]; 
p=0·001; figure 2). For bacterial meningitis, there was 
also a reduction of 1% for each hour delay, but this was 
not statistically significant (0·995 [0·989–1·002]; p=0·16). 
24 (24%) of 99 patients with bacterial meningitis were 
diagnosed by molecular methods alone. The role of the 
different tests in diagnosing bacterial meningitis is 
shown in the appendix.
139 (60%) of 231 patients with viral meningitis had at 
least one dose of an antiviral (aciclovir or valaciclovir), and 
51 (37%) of 139 received a course, defined as at least 5 days. 
42 (43%) of 98 patients with herpes simplex virus or 
varicella zoster virus meningitis received a course of 
antivirals with a median duration of 10 days (IQR 5–30). 
The treatment regimen varied considerably between 
patients with herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster 
virus meningitis (appendix). Patients in whom no cause 
was identified were more likely to receive antiviral drugs 
than those in whom a definitive diagnosis of enterovirus 
meningitis was made (50 [20%] of 248 vs eight [6%] of 127; 
p=0·001). The antiviral drugs would have been ineffective 
against enteroviruses. Most patients (160 [69%] of 231) 
with proven viral meningitis also received at least one dose 
of antibiotics (median duration 1 day [IQR 0–3]), and 
199 (75%) of 267 patients without an identified cause 
received at least a single dose. 328 (72%) of 454 patients 
who did not have meningitis received empirical antibiotics.
The median length of stay for patients with viral 
meningitis was 4 days (IQR 3–7). Patients with herpes-
virus meningitis stayed in hospital longer than did 
patients with enteroviral meningitis (median 6 days 
[IQR 4–10] vs 3·5 days [3–5]; p<0·001), and those with 
varicella zoster virus meningitis stayed longer than did 
those with herpes simplex virus (8 days [IQR 5–11] vs 
5 days [3–8]; p=0·02). Patients who received antivirals 
were in hospital longer than those who did not (median 
9 days [IQR 6–12] vs 3 days [2–5]; p<0·001), and individuals 
with lymphocytic meningitis of unknown cause stayed in 
hospital slightly longer than did those with proven viral 
meningitis (5 days [3·0–8·5] vs 4 days [3–7]; p=0·09). 
Seven (1%) of 1113 patients died before discharge, 
five (71%) of whom had meningitis (three had 
pneumococcal, one had tuberculous, and one had 
malignant meningitis). 91 (8%) of 1113 patients required

admission to intensive care; 52 (57%) of 91 patients had 
bacterial meningitis, and 37 (71%) of those 52 had 
pneumococcal disease. No patients with viral meningitis 
died or required admission to critical care.
Quality of life was reduced in all groups at all 
timepoints, when compared with the UK population, 
especially in those aged 25–35 years (figure 3). EQ-5D-3L 
utility scores were similar for patients with both viral and 
bacterial meningitis; all patients had scores worse than 
the population norms for the relevant age groups. They 
were significantly lower for patients with herpes simplex 
virus meningitis, compared with the other viral causes, 
at 6 weeks after discharge (mean score 0·45 [SD 0·36] vs 
0·72 [0·25]; p=0·004). 12 (86%) of 14 patients with 
herpes simplex virus meningitis who returned the 
questionnaires had problems with anxiety or depression 
at 6 weeks (appendix). Supporting, and confirming, the 
EQ-5D-3L data, all groups had worse SF-6D scores than 
UK norms (appendix). The mean QALYs for patients 
with viral meningitis, over the first year, was 0·72 
(SD 0·04). Compared with the age-matched UK pop-
ulation, patients with viral meningitis had a mean loss of 
0·2 QALYs (SD 0·04) in that first year (appendix). There 
was no significant difference in median time to resolution 
of headache between patients with viral and those with 
bacterial meningitis, as measured by the total morbidity 
score (7 days vs 8 days, p=0·09; appendix). Patients with 
viral meningitis had significantly worse ABNAS scores 
than did 234 healthy controls at all four timepoints in the 
year after illness (appendix).
Discussion
This study provides the first estimate of the incidence of 
viral meningitis in UK adults. Using clinical and 
laboratory data, we estimated the annual incidence of 
confirmed viral meningitis in UK adults to be 2·73 per 
100 000. Previous UK studies of meningitis have been 
based on coding data or laboratory reports, which exclude

The EQ-5D-3L determines health status across five domains, which is converted into a utility score. A score of 1 represents best health and 0 represents dead. Health 
states perceived to be worse than death have a negative score. Datapoints are mean scores, and error bars indicate SDs. Median age for viral meningitis was 32 years 
(IQR 24–42), and median age for bacterial meningitis was 56 years (34–65).

cases that have no identified cause.1,2,11 We estimated the 
annual incidence of all meningitis to be 13·47 per 100 000. 
Previously, a similar estimate of the annual incidence of 
meningitis in the USA was 27·9 per 100 000,22 although 
the study is 20 years old and included adults and children. 
The incidence is likely to be substantially lower now, 
given the impact of immunisation.23
Enteroviruses 
were 
the 
most 
common 
cause, 
accounting for just above 50% of all confirmed viral 
meningitis cases. Herpesviruses accounted for 101 (44%) 
of 231 cases, substantially more than in previous studies 
from other countries.4 This finding might, in part, be 
explained by different rates of herpes simplex virus 
type 2 seroprevalence, which is higher in northern than 
in southern Europe.24
In line with other studies, a substantial proportion of 
our patients had no cause identified,3,4 which poses a 
challenge as to how to categorise them. There have been 
several attempts at diagnostic algorithms, each of which 
has its limitations and none of which has become routine 
clinical practice.25 We chose a pragmatic and objective 
classification, which is used in UK hospitals daily, based 
on predominant CSF leucocyte type. We recognise that 
this classification does not equate to presumed viral or 
bacterial meningitis, and indeed 18% of patients with 
bacterial meningitis had a lymphocytic CSF and 7% of 
viral meningitis cases (mostly enteroviral) had a 
neutrophil predominance. Nevertheless, this method is a 
helpful way of providing an initial patient classification. 
Patients with lymphocytic meningitis of unknown cause 
had a significantly longer time from admission to lumbar 
puncture than those with proven viral or bacterial 
meningitis and those with neutrophilic meningitis of 
unknown cause, suggesting that an early lumbar 
puncture might increase the number of patients having a 
cause identified. It could be, as is the case for enterovirus 
meningitis, that there is a change in the immune 
response from neutrophils initially to lymphocytes later.
Diagnosis of a specific virus reduces inappropriate 
antibiotic usage, length of hospital stay, and hospital 
admission costs.5,7 We have also shown that it reduces the 
unnecessary use of antivirals. 21% of patients with 
lymphocytic meningitis of unknown cause received a 
course of aciclovir or valaciclovir compared with 6% of 
patients diagnosed with enteroviral meningitis, on which 
aciclovir would have no effect. With no evidence base to 
support aciclovir treatment in meningitis caused by 
herpes simplex virus or varicella zoster virus, as has been 
highlighted previously, there was much variation in 
practice.6 Almost half of the patients in the current study 
received 
antivirals, 
resulting 
in 
longer 
hospital 
admissions. Most patients who had antivirals had 
intravenous treatment, necessitating inpatient care. A 
trial of aciclovir or valaciclovir in acute herpesvirus 
meningitis would help to determine best practice. 
Improvement of diagnostic testing so that more patients 
can have a specific cause determined quickly could 
reduce unnecessary use of antimicrobials and therefore 
reduce hospital stays and other investigations.7 Full 
diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness studies should 
be done before any new tests are adopted widely.
Once viral meningitis is diagnosed, efforts should focus 
on symptomatic treatment and expediting dis 
charge. 
Theoretically, diagnosis can happen quickly; a lumbar 
puncture and the diagnostic PCR can be done within a 
few hours. However, in our study, the median time from 
admission to lumbar puncture for all patients was 17 h, 
and the median length of hospitalisation for patients 
with viral meningitis was 4 days. The prolonged time 
from admission to lumbar puncture is concerning. 
International guidelines all stress the urgency of the 
diagnostic lumbar puncture;25–27 delays decrease pathogen 
yield and can increase mortality.28–30 The length of time to 
get a lumbar puncture might explain why a large 
proportion of patients had no cause identified in our 
study, especially those with viral meningitis, for which 
there was a highly significant association between time to 
lumbar puncture and likelihood of getting a definitive 
diagnosis. Unnecessary neuroimaging might have 
contributed to the delays, and has been highlighted 
previously as a risk factor for increased mortality in 
bacterial meningitis.30,31 In the UK, the requirement for all 
patients to be transferred out of the emergency 
department within 4 h creates unintended pressure, 
causing key investigations such as lumbar puncture to be 
deferred until patients have been admitted to a ward. 
Additional delays in diagnosis occur if the CSF sample is 
sent to an offsite laboratory for analysis. Because of 
sample batching and transport, it can take several days 
from doing a lumbar puncture to receiving results, 
despite the rapidity of the test itself. If PCR is done locally, 
7 days a week, on receipt of a single CSF sample, the 
length of the hospital stay can be reduced to less than a 
day, resulting in substantial cost savings.7 To make this 
saving relatively simple, changes are required, such as 
doing lumbar punctures in the emergency department 
and having diagnostics available on site.
Despite viral meningitis often being referred to as 
benign and self-limiting,7 we found long-term neuro- 
psychiatric sequelae, particularly anxiety, depression, and 
neurocognitive dysfunction. Although patients with 
bacterial meningitis have more severe disease initially in 
terms of critical care need and mortality, over the longer 
term all patients with meningitis, viral and bacterial, had 
sequelae affecting quality of life, including significant 
problems with memory and mental health.
There are limitations to our study. Because of its 
prospective nature, we risked not recruiting all eligible 
patients. We accounted for this by identifying missed 
cases retrospectively in the laboratories and then 
applying an extrapolation. We extrapolated the incidence 
from the northwest to the whole country, which assumes 
that there is minimal variation in incidence throughout 
the UK. We found the incidence of pneumococcal,

meningococcal, and all viral meningitis was similar to 
that found in other UK-based studies that used only 
laboratory data.2,11 Relying on CSF analysis excluded 
patients who did not have a lumbar puncture but allowed 
us to accurately define our cohort. Our definitions might 
have missed some cases of viral meningitis with a CSF 
cell count of less than 5 × 10⁶ cells per L or those in 
whom a lumbar puncture was not done. Children, 
especially neonates, can have clinical features of 
meningitis, with viruses detected in the CSF, without a 
CSF pleocytosis.32 This phenomenon is less well 
recognised in adults. 58% of our patients who had a 
lumbar puncture had meningitis, which is higher than 
the proportion found in other studies overseas,33 and 
might indicate a higher threshold for lumbar puncture 
in the UK than in other countries. Given that we looked 
only for the most common viruses, we cannot exclude 
the possibility that other rare, novel, or emerging viruses 
might have been responsible for some cases. However, 
previous attempts using novel techniques have not 
identified significantly more pathogens than routine 
approaches.34
In summary, this study shows that viruses are the 
major cause of meningitis in adults in the UK, and 
impose a considerable clinical burden, both acutely and 
longer term. To improve management and reduce costs, 
there is a pressing need for better diagnostic practices, 
including rapid tests and the delivery of high-quality viral 
diagnostics locally. Treatments also need to be developed 
and assessed that could allow quicker recovery and fewer 
longer-term sequelae.
