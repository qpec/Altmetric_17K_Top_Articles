Abstract 
Background 
Genetic variations in dystrobrevin binding protein-1 (DTNBP1 or dysbindin-1) have been 
implicated as risk factors in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The encoded protein dysbindin-1 
functions in the regulation of synaptic activity and synapse development. Intriguingly, a loss of 
function mutation in Dtnbp1 in mice disrupted both glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission 
in the cerebral cortex; pyramidal neurons displayed enhanced excitability due to reductions in 
inhibitory synaptic inputs. However, the mechanism by which reduced dysbindin-1 activity 
causes inhibitory synaptic deficits remains unknown. 
Methods 
We investigated the role of dysbindin-1 in the exocytosis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF) from cortical excitatory neurons, organotypic brain slices, and acute slices from 
dysbindin-1 mutant mice and determined how this change in BDNF exocytosis trans-synaptically 
affected the number of inhibitory synapses formed on excitatory neurons, via whole-cell 
 Yuan et al.

recordings, immunohistochemistry, and live-cell imaging using total internal reflection 
fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). 
Results 
A decrease in dysbindin-1 reduces the exocytosis of BDNF from cortical excitatory neurons, and 
this reduction in BDNF exocytosis trans-synaptically resulted in reduced inhibitory synapse 
numbers formed on excitatory neurons. Furthermore, application of exogenous BDNF rescued 
the inhibitory synaptic deficits caused by the reduced dysbindin-1 level in both cultured cortical 
neurons and slice cultures. 
Conclusion 
Taken together, our results demonstrate that these two genes linked to risk for schizophrenia 
(BDNF and dysbindin-1) function together to regulate interneuron development and cortical 
network activity. This evidence supports the investigation of the association between dysbindin-1 
and BDNF in humans with schizophrenia. 
Introduction 
In the mammalian central nervous system, neurons receive inhibitory synaptic inputs from 
GABAergic interneurons and excitatory inputs from glutamatergic neurons (1, 2). Converging 
experimental and clinical evidence suggests that the dysfunction of appropriate GABAergic 
inhibition and the consequent imbalance between excitation and inhibition in the cerebral cortex 
underlie the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, a complex psychiatric disorder with lifetime 
morbid risk close to 1% of general population (3-5). For example, in the neocortex of 
schizophrenia patients, the activity of the rate-limiting synthetic enzyme glutamic acid 
decarboxylase (GAD) is reduced (6). This finding has been repeatedly confirmed and extended 
 Yuan et al.  
Page 4 of 30 
in subsequent studies that showed alterations in several presynaptic and postsynaptic components 
of the GABAergic system (7). 
Dystrobrevin binding protein 1 (DTNBP1 or dysbindin-1), that encodes dysbindin-1, has 
been implicated in several studies as a potential susceptibility gene for schizophrenia (8-11). In 
schizophrenia, dysbindin-1 expression has been reported to be reduced in cortical and limbic 
neurons, suggesting that reduced dysbindin-1 protein levels may be a disease-related trait (11-15). 
In mice, a loss-of-function mutation in Dtnbp1 (dys-MT) disrupts both glutamatergic and 
GABAergic transmission in the prefrontal cortex, and this disruption is associated with working 
memory deficits (16-21). Most importantly, in dys-MT mice, cortical pyramidal neurons in the 
prefrontal cortex display enhanced excitability, presumably due to a reduction in GABAergic 
signaling (19-21). The mechanism underlying the loss of inhibitory activity in dys-MT mice 
remains unclear because dysbindin-1 expression is largely restricted to excitatory neurons rather 
than interneurons (13, 22). 
In this study, we discovered an unexpected role of dysbindin-1 in the exocytosis of brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), an important trophic factor for the differentiation and 
survival of inhibitory neurons, from excitatory neurons (23). We further determined that this 
reduction in BDNF secretion reduces the number of functional GABAergic synapses that are 
trans-neuronally formed on excitatory neurons (24). Given that interneurons cannot synthesize 
BDNF by themselves but require BDNF for the formation and maintenance of their synapses 
(25-27), our results demonstrate that these two well-known schizophrenia susceptibility gene 
products (BDNF and dysbindin-1) function together to regulate interneuron synapse 
development. Furthermore, our results provide considerable insight into the cellular and

molecular mechanisms that regulate the development of the neural circuitry in the brain and link 
these abnormalities in BDNF secretion to cognitive disease. 
Methods and materials 
Detailed description of the experimental procedures can be found in the supplement. All animal 
experiments in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of 
the Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School and the Lieber Institute for Brain Development. 
Cell Culture 
Cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic day 17 (E17) rat embryos and cultured in 
Neurobasal medium with B27 supplement (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). At day-in-vitro (DIV) 7, 
cultures were transfected with a calcium phosphate transfection kit (Clontech, Madison, WI). 
HEK293 cells and PC12 cells were maintained using standard protocols and were transfected 
with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). 
Molecular Biology. 
Dysbindin-1 and scrambled shRNAs were generated using pLentilox 3.7 vector. Dysbindin-1 
shRNA target sequences were conserved in both mouse and rat dysbindin-1A and C isoforms. 
pCAG-MCS2-myc-dysbindin-1 was generated as reported previously (28), and the shRNA-
resistant mutant of dysbindin-1 was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis. 
Fluorescent Immunocytochemistry 
Cultured rat neurons and mouse brain slices (P28) were stained with various primary antibodies, 
followed by incubation with appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies, and 
imaged. Detailed antibody information can be found in the supplement.

Imaging. 
Images were acquired with an LSM 710 (Zeiss, Singapore) confocal microscope using either 40x 
or 63x oil objectives and TIRFM imaging was conducted as previously reported (29). 
Electrophysiology. 
Cortical neurons were transfected with various constructs as previously described (29). Whole-
cell voltage clamp recordings were performed on DIV 14-15 neurons. For acute slice recording, 
wild-type and dys-MT male mice at P15-35 were used as previously described (21). 
Statistical Analysis 
Unless otherwise stated, error bars represent the standard error of the mean. All statistical 
analyses were listed in the supplement.  
Results 
Increased excitatory synaptic transmission in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal 
cortex of dys-MT mice. 
The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a brain structure that is known to play a critical role in executive 
function and is prominently implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (21). In the PFC, 
top-down information is transmitted via pathways from layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons to 
pyramidal neurons in L5, which is a major corticofugal output layer of the PFC network. We 
characterized the synaptic properties of L2/3 pyramidal neurons within prelimbic area (PrL), 
homologous to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in primates, by measuring spontaneous excitatory 
postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings (Figure 1A and 1B)(20). 
Intriguingly, we found that dys-MT mice exhibited a dramatic increase in the frequency of the 
sEPSCs that were recorded from L2/3 pyramidal cells, without changing the amplitude (WT: 
2.69 ± 0.62 Hz, 10.50 ± 0.29 pA; dys-MT: 6.65 ± 1.50 Hz, 10.99 ± 1.25 pA; P<0.05)(Figure 1C 
 Yuan et al.  
Page 7 of 30 
and 1D). These results indicate an increase in excitatory synaptic transmission in the PFC of dys-
MT mice. 
 
Previous reports suggested the decreased excitability of interneurons and decreased 
inhibitory transmission onto pyramidal neurons partially accounts for the increased frequency of 
sEPSCs in the PFC of dys-MT mice (20). To test this further, we monitored spontaneous 
miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in L2/3 pyramidal neurons within PrL. In 
the presence of glutamatergic antagonists and sodium channel blocker, we observed significant 
reduction in the frequency of mIPSCs (WT: 5.23 ± 0.30 Hz; dys-MT: 4.29 ± 0.27 Hz; 
P<0.05)(Figure 1E and 1F). However, no change in mIPSCs amplitude was detected in PrL of 
dys-MT mice (WT: 22.19 ± 1.98 pA; dys-MT: 18.31 ± 1.32 pA)(Figure 1E and 1G). Intriguingly, 
immunocytochemistry revealed that the density (WT: 1.52 ± 0.08 per 10 μm2; dys-MT: 1.24 ± 
0.04 per 10 μm2; p<0.01) and size (WT: 1.46 ± 0.05 μm2; dys-MT: 1.33 ± 0.04 μm2; p<0.05) of 
VGAT (an inhibitory presynaptic marker)-expressing boutons, that represent GABAergic 
inhibitory synaptic terminals, in the L2/3 within PrL of dys-MT mice were reduced significantly, 
indicating the reduced inhibitory inputs onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons (Figure S1 in Supplement 
1). 
 
 
Reduced inhibitory synapse number in cultured cortical excitatory neurons upon 
dysbindin-1 knockdown. 
Our results indicated that decreased inhibitory synaptic transmission onto pyramidal neurons in 
the PrL of dys-MT mice might result in increased network activity. However, it remains unclear 
how the loss of dysbindin-1 results in these changes. First, we investigated whether the loss of 
endogenous dysbindin-1 in either pyramidal neurons or inhibitory neurons affects inhibitory

synaptic input. To that end, we used dissociated cultured cortical neurons and generated a series 
of bicistronic lentiviral constructs expressing a short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) together with 
enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP). The expression of a specific shRNA construct 
targeting rat and mouse dysbindin-1 (dys-shRNA), reduced the expression of recombinant 
dysbindin-1 to approximately 52% of control levels in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and 
reduced the expression levels of endogenous dysbindin-1 in cultured cortical neurons to 48% 
(Figure S2 in Supplement 1).   
 
Cultured cortical neurons were transfected with either scrambled shRNA (scr) or dys-
shRNA and were subsequently immunostained against VGAT (Figure 2A). We restricted our 
analysis to excitatory neurons identified based on somatic morphology as well as a CaMKII-
reporter- driven, lentiviral probe that specifically labels glutamatergic excitatory neurons (Figure 
S3 in Supplement 1)(30). The knockdown of dysbindin-1 significantly reduced the inhibitory 
synapse density, as assessed using the number of VGAT-positive clusters compared with 
neurons transfected scrambled shRNA (scr: 0.151 ± 0.018 boutons/μm; dys-shRNA: 0.081 ± 
0.011 boutons/μm; p<0.01) (Figure. 2A and B). Moreover, we analyzed the number of inhibitory 
synapses using another inhibitory presynaptic marker, GAD65/67, and we found a similar 
reduction in synapses from dys-shRNA transfected neurons (scr: 0.145 ± 0.017 boutons/μm; dys-
shRNA: 0.082 ± 0.016 boutons/μm; p<0.01) (Figure S4 in Supplement 1). To further confirm the 
specificity of the shRNA experiments, we performed a rescue experiment using an shRNA-
resistant form of dysbindin-1 (dys-R) that harbors 4 silent mutations within the sequence targeted 
by the shRNA (Figure S2A and S2B in Supplement 1). Western blot analysis confirmed the 
resistance of dys-R to dys-shRNA in vitro (Figure S2A and S2B in Supplement 1). The effect of 
dysbindin-1 knockdown on the density of inhibitory synapses was rescued by the co-expression 
 Yuan et al.  
Page 9 of 30 
of dys-R (dys-shRNA+ dys-R: 0.158 ± 0.015 boutons/μm) (Figure 2A and 2B). These data 
indicate that dysbindin-1 knockdown in excitatory neurons reduces the number of inhibitory 
synapses formed. 
Given the reduction in the number of inhibitory synapses due to dysbindin-1 knockdown 
in the excitatory neurons, we recorded inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) via whole-cell 
patch-clamp recordings of cortical pyramidal neurons that were transfected with either scr or 
dys-shRNA. The neurons expressing dys-shRNA displayed a significant reduction in the 
frequency (but not the amplitude) of the mIPSCs compared with the neurons expressing scr (scr: 
1.38 ± 0.25 Hz, 42.6 ±3.9 pA; dys-shRNA: 0.78 ± 0.07 Hz, 45.2 ± 2.1 pA; P<0.01)(Figure 2C-E). 
This reduction in the mIPSC frequency was restored by co-expressing dys-R (dys-shRNA+ dys-
R: 1.41 ±0.13 Hz, 47.1 ± 3.8 pA; p=0.59) (Figure 2C-E). Taken together, our data strongly 
indicate that endogenously expressed dysbindin-1 in excitatory neurons regulates the number of 
inhibitory synaptic inputs. 
 
To unequivocally rule out any effect of the endogenously expressed dybsindin-1 in 
interneurons, we performed two additional sets of experiments. First, we used a bicistronic 
construct expressing only GFP in the interneurons using the GAD65 promoter and analyzed the 
complexity, length, and branch numbers of the dendrites. We found no significant difference 
between the groups (Figure S5A and S5B in Supplement 1). Additionally, the loss of dysbindin-1 
expression from interneurons did not affect the density of their presynaptic GABA-containing 
synaptic vesicles as evaluated with GAD67 immunostaining (Figure S5C-D in Supplement 1). 
Together, these results indicate that the reduction in dysbindin-1 expression in interneurons did 
not change morphology or the number of GABA-containing vesicles.

Reduced BDNF secretion in neurons upon dysbindin-1 knockdown. 
We observed that dysbindin-1 knockdown in excitatory neurons reduced the number of 
inhibitory synapses on the excitatory neurons. What mediates this trans-neuronal modulation? 
Recent studies have shown that dysbindin-1 interacts with and regulates the trafficking and 
exocytosis of secretory vesicles (31-33). Therefore, we hypothesized that dysbindin-1 
knockdown impaired the release from excitatory neurons of a trophic factor that is critical for 
interneuron synapse development and/or formation on excitatory neurons. Intriguingly, BDNF 
may represent the only trophic factor that is a plausible candidate for this trans-neuronal activity 
(25, 34). First, gene ablation studies have shown that signaling mediated by BDNF and TrkB, a 
cognate receptor of BDNF, regulates inhibitory synapse formation and the maturation of 
inhibitory neurons in the cortex. Furthermore, BDNF knockdown in an individual excitatory 
neuron in the cerebral cortex results in a reduction in inhibitory synapses on that neuron (27). 
However, inhibitory neurons must rely on the BDNF that is secreted from excitatory neurons 
because inhibitory neurons do not express BDNF mRNA (35). Based on these findings, we 
sought to determine whether dysbindin-1 knockdown in cortical pyramidal neurons reduces 
BDNF secretion. 
 
First, we monitored the cellular localization of dysbindin-1 in respect to BDNF in 
neurons. In cortical neurons, GFP-tagged dysbindin-1 puncta colocalized with TdTomato-tagged 
BDNF signals, which were also overlapped with immunoreactivity of chromogranin B, a marker 
protein for large-dense core vesicles (LDCVs)(Figure S6 in Supplement 1). We next examined 
the temporal and spatial relationship between dysbindin-1 and BDNF within neurons using 
confocal live-cell imaging. Live-cell imaging revealed that punctate spots of GFP-dysbindin-1 
 Yuan et al.  
Page 11 of 30 
traveled together with TdTomato-BDNF-harboring vesicles along the dendrite (Movie S1) as 
well as an axon (Movie S2) in cortical neurons. These data suggested a potential role of 
dysbindin-1 in regulating the trafficking and exocytosis of BDNF secretory vesicles. 
Next, to directly visualize BDNF secretion from neurons, we took advantage of a pH-
sensitive variant of EGFP (super-ecliptic pHluorin, SEP), the fluorescence of which is quenched 
at low pH, and we fused this SEP to the C-terminal end of BDNF (BDNF-SEP)(Figure 3A)(36). 
The distribution of BDNF-SEP, as revealed via co-immunostaining for EGFP, SMI312 (an 
axonal marker), and MAP2 (a dendritic marker), was similar to that of endogenous BDNF 
stained with a BDNF-specific antibody, displaying punctate expression patterns in axons, 
dendrites, and cell bodies (Figure S7 in Supplement 1). The neuronal processes that were not 
stained with the MAP2 antibody were further confirmed to be axons; these processes were co-
immunostained with an antibody against the axon-specific microtubule-associated protein Smi-
312 (Figure S7 in Supplement 1). Reconstructed images in the axial plane of an axon, a dendrite, 
and a soma further supported the granular nature of the punctate fluorescent staining (Figure 3B), 
as is consistent with previous reports (Figure S7 in Supplement 1). 
To detect BDNF secretion via exocytosis, we performed time-lapse total internal 
reflection fluorescence (TIRF) imaging, which enables the selective excitation of fluorophores in 
the evanescent field above the cover glass (≤100 nm)(29, 37). When expressed in cultured 
cortical neurons, BDNF-SEP puncta were sparsely distributed in axons, dendrites, and cell 
bodies (Figure 3B). Bath application of NH4Cl solution (50 mM, pH 7.4)(38), which de-acidifies 
the vesicular lumen and thereby unquenches BDNF-SEP, resulted in a marked increase in the 
fluorescence intensity of each punctum and revealed many BDNF-SEP puncta in each neuron 
 Yuan et al.  
Page 12 of 30 
(Figure S8 in Supplement 1), suggesting that BDNF-SEP was quenched in a majority of the 
vesicles. 
Next, we monitored the activity-induced exocytosis of BDNF-SEP-containing vesicles in 
cultured cortical neurons by applying a high concentration of K+ (60 mM) to depolarize the 
neurons. Prior to high K+ stimulation, we detected discrete, randomly appearing puncta of 
BDNF-SEP fluorescence (Figure 3B). These randomly appearing BDNF-SEP puncta indicated 
spontaneous neuronal BDNF exocytosis (39). After high K+ treatment, BDNF-SEP fluorescence 
was significantly increased in the control neurons (Figure 3B and Movie S3). Additionally, the 
high K+ treatment increased the number of BDNF exocytotic events, as quantified by the 
appearance of new fluorescent puncta at the cell surface (Figure 3C). In contrast, the increase in 
the number and intensity of BDNF-SEP puncta induced by high K+ treatment was dramatically 
reduced in neurons expressing dys-shRNA (Figure 3C). Additionally, we monitored the activity-
dependent exocytosis of BDNF-SEP in PC12 cells and found that expressing dys-shRNA 
markedly reduced BDNF-SEP exocytosis (Figure 3D and E). Taken together, these data suggest 
that dysbindin-1 knockdown reduces activity-dependent BDNF secretion from neurons. 
BDNF application rescues dysbindin-1 shRNA-mediated inhibitory synapse defects. 
The reduction in BDNF secretion from dysbindin-1 knockdown neurons suggested that BDNF 
could act as a crucial trophic factor in regulating the formation and/or maintenance of 
interneuron synapses. If this hypothesis were correct, the application of exogenous BDNF would 
rescue the reduced numbers of inhibitory synapses detected in cortical neurons after dysbindin-1 
knockdown. 
To test this hypothesis, we exogenously applied recombinant BDNF (100 ng/ml) for 4 
days to cortical neurons transfected with either scr or dys-shRNA. Dysbindin-1 knockdown in 
 Yuan et al.  
Page 13 of 30 
excitatory neurons reduced the inhibitory synapse density, as assessed using the number of 
VGAT-positive clusters (scr.: 0.134 ± 0.024; dys-shRNA: 0.076 ± 0.009 boutons/μm)(Figure 4A 
and 4B). Intriguingly, the application of exogenous BDNF rescued this reduction in the 
inhibitory synapse density in dys-shRNA expressing neurons (BDNF with dys-shRNA: 0.156 ± 
0.015 boutons/μm; p<0.001)(Figure 4A and 4B). We confirmed this result using GAD65 
immunostaining as an alternative method to quantify the inhibitory synapse density and found a 
similar change (Figure S9 in Supplement 1). To assess the specificity of this BDNF-mediated 
effect, we treated dys-shRNA expressing neurons with recombinant nerve growth factor (NGF, 
100 ng/ml), which has multiple synaptic effects (Figure S10 in Supplement 1). Treatment with 
NGF failed to rescue the inhibitory synapse reduction in dys-shRNA expressing neurons, 
indicating that the rescue of the reduction in inhibitory synapse density in dysbindin-1 
knockdown neurons was specific to BDNF. 
To further determine whether exogenous BDNF treatment rescues the deficits in 
inhibitory synaptic transmission in dys-shRNA expressing neurons, we measured the mIPSCs 
from dys-shRNA expressing neurons treated with either vehicle or BDNF (100 ng/ml). The 
application of BDNF (but not of the vehicle) rescued the reduction in frequency of mIPSCs 
recorded from dys-shRNA expressing excitatory neurons (scr: 1.87 ± 0.30 Hz, 47.1 ± 3.5 pA; 
dys-shRNA: 0.73 ± 0.12 Hz, 54.24 ± 2.37 pA; dys-shRNA with BDNF: 1.63 ±0.30 Hz, 56.2 ± 
3.7 pA; P<0.01) (Figure 4C-E). Taken together, we conclude that BDNF selectively rescues the 
reduction in the number of functional inhibitory synapses in cortical excitatory neurons induced 
by dysbindin-1 knockdown.

Rescued inhibitory synaptic transmission upon BDNF application in ex vivo organotypic 
hippocampal slices. 
To investigate the effects of the lack of endogenous dysbindin-1 expression on excitatory 
pyramidal neuron function ex vivo, we transfected our shRNA constructs into organotypic 
hippocampal slices via biolistic gene gun (27). The transfected neurons were marked with 
simultaneously introduced EGFP (Figure 5A). To induce an extremely sparse distribution of the 
transfected neurons, steel mesh was attached to the muzzle of the gene guns (40). Typically, 
fewer than 10 EGFP-expressing neurons were detected among the vast number of neurons within 
each slice culture (Figure 5A). 
 
Next, we measured the inhibitory synaptic transmission in hippocampal pyramidal 
neurons expressing either scr or dys-shRNA. Analysis of the mIPSCs revealed marked decreases 
in the frequency of mIPSCs in dys-shRNA-expressing pyramidal neurons compared with scr-
expressing pyramidal neurons (scr: 5.504 ± 0.476 Hz, 40.32 ± 1.70 pA; dys-shRNA: 3.6 ± 0.51 
Hz, 34.6 ± 3.4 pA; P <0.05) (Figure 5C and 5D). Intriguingly, these inhibitory synaptic deficits 
were rescued by BDNF application (100ng/ml, 4 days) (dys-shRNA: 3.6 ± 0.51 Hz, 34.6 ± 3.4 
pA; dys-shRNA with BDNF: 5.984 ± 0.561 Hz, 32.5 ± 2.12 pA; P< 0.01) (Figure 5C and 5D), as 
indicated by the significant shifts in the cumulative distribution curves for the mIPSC inter-event 
interval. 
Discussion 
Since the dysbindin-1 gene was identified, extensive molecular, cell biological, animal model, 
and human genotype-phenotype studies have been conducted to address the multiple functions 
and mechanisms of dysbindin-1 activity in the brain. Because dysbindin-1 is thought to mediate 
a range of intermediate phenotypes that underlie schizophrenia (21, 41, 42), elucidating the 
 Yuan et al.  
Page 15 of 30 
precise biological functions of dysbindin-1 have received intensive study. Disruption of 
dysbindin-1 is thought to confer glutamatergic dysfunction (43). However, in mice, a loss-of-
function mutation in dysbindin-1 (dys-MT) disrupts inhibitory neurotransmission in both the 
hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (19-21) via an unknown mechanism. In the present study, 
we discovered an unexpected role of dysbindin-1 for the exocytosis of BDNF from excitatory 
neurons that consequently trans-neuronally reduced the number of functional inhibitory synapses 
formed on the excitatory neurons. 
Dysbindin-1, BDNF, and their roles in inhibitory synapse development. 
BDNF is a neurotrophic factor that regulates synapse development and plasticity in the 
mammalian brain (44, 45). Interestingly, BDNF regulates the maturation of interneurons, the 
dysfunction of which has been associated with schizophrenia (46). For example, in BDNF 
knockout mice, the number of interneurons is significantly reduced compared with that in wild-
type mice (47, 48). Conversely, in transgenic mice overexpressing BDNF, the maturation of 
interneurons was significantly accelerated; this effect was accompanied by an increase in 
spontaneous network activity (49, 50). Similarly, the application of exogenous BDNF to 
interneuron cultures resulted in accelerated formation of reciprocal connections via enhanced 
TrkB signaling (51). 
 
Intriguingly, GABAergic interneurons do not express BDNF mRNA and thus cannot 
produce BDNF themselves (52). Therefore, from whence do these neurons receive the BDNF 
that is necessary for their function? Kohara et al. reported that in co-cultures of BDNF-KO 
neurons with GFP-labeled wild-type neurons, interneurons receive BDNF released from 
excitatory neurons (26). They later found that BDNF ablation in a single excitatory neuron 
induced a local reduction in the number of inhibitory synapses to that BDNF-KO excitatory 
 Yuan et al.

neuron (27). Likewise, enhanced BDNF exocytosis in synaptotagmin-IV knockout mice (53, 54) 
and reduced BDNF exocytosis in CAPS2 knockout mice have been shown to result in increased 
and decreased GABAergic synaptic transmission, respectively (55). These findings suggest that 
BDNF (presumably released from excitatory neurons) shapes and regulates local inhibitory 
synapse formation and/or maintenance. Therefore, it is conceivable that any defect in the cellular 
and molecular machinery that regulates BDNF trafficking and release from excitatory neurons 
could affect inhibitory synapse formation on these excitatory neurons. 
 
Here, we demonstrate that the loss of dysbindin-1 from cortical excitatory neurons leads 
to a reduction in functional inhibitory synapses, as demonstrated previously in the dys-MT 
mouse cortex and hippocampus (Figures 1 and 2)(20, 21). However, the loss of dysbindin-1 from 
inhibitory neurons did not result in any defects in dendritic morphology, or formation of axonal 
synaptic boutons (Figure S4 in Supplement 1). This was potentially due to the lack of expression 
of dysbindin-1 in GABAergic neurons (22). Additionally, we show that the impairment in 
activity-dependent BDNF release from dysbindin-1 knockdown cortical neurons and neuronal 
cells (Figure 3) and, intriguingly, the inhibitory synapse defects exhibited by dysbindin-1 
knockdown neurons were rescued by BDNF application (Figures 4 and 5). Our data reveal novel 
trans-neuronal signaling between excitatory and inhibitory neurons and provide new insight into 
the cellular and molecular mechanisms that link these abnormalities in BDNF secretion to 
psychiatric disorders. 
Potential mechanisms of reduced BDNF exocytosis in dysbindin-1 knockdown neurons. 
Dysbindin-1A is a component of the BLOC-1 complex, and several studies have demonstrated 
that the loss of dysbindin-1 is accompanied by the loss of all BLOC-1 complex constituents (11, 
22, 56, 57). Although our dysbindin-1 shRNA is designed to target conserved regions in both 
 Yuan et al.  
Page 17 of 30 
dysbindin-1A and C isoforms, co-expression of dysbindin-1A isoform rescued dysbindin-1 
shRNA associated interneuron synaptic defects, indicating that dysbindin-1A isoform might 
affect BDNF exocytosis. Further rescue experiments using dysbindin-1C isoform or isoform 
specific shRNAs may elucidate which of dysbindin-1 isoforms contribute to BDNF release and 
trans-neuronal interneuron synapse maintenance. 
 
In addition, dysbindin-1 and three other subunits of BLOC-1 (pallidin, snapin, and muted) 
interact with adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3) and are also expressed in AP-3-containing 
vesicles in neurons (58). AP-3 has generally been considered to function in endocytic rather than 
biosynthetic pathways; however, a recent RNAi-based screen identified that AP-3 functions in 
the formation, trafficking, and regulated exocytosis of LDCVs, which contain the BDNF that is 
secreted from neurons (59). Additionally, the loss of AP-3 affects the number, morphology, and 
density of LDCVs in neurons (59, 60). Furthermore, mice lacking the neuronal isoform of AP-3 
(ap-3μ knockout mice) exhibited the reduced inhibitory neurotransmission and abnormal 
propagation of neuronal excitability that were detected in dys-MT mice (61). More importantly, 
the BDNF content was reduced in the hippocampus of BLOC-1-deficient mice (62). Taken 
together, we speculate that defects in the dysbindin-1 interactome may impair BDNF release via 
AP-3-mediated LDCV function, but this possibility also requires further investigation. 
Targeting interneuron and BDNF/TrkB signaling for treatment of schizophrenia. 
Dysbindin-1 protein expression is widely distributed throughout the brain, but it is concentrated 
in synapses in brain regions that are commonly affected in schizophrenia, such as the 
hippocampus, the striatum, and the prefrontal cortex (11). Interestingly, decreases in one or more 
dysbindin-1 isoforms have been detected in the cortex and the hippocampus of schizophrenic 
patients (11, 15, 63). Furthermore, dys-MT mice exhibited behavioral deficits resembling 
 Yuan et al.  
Page 18 of 30 
schizophrenia intermediate phenotypes; thus, dys-MT mice represent a good animal model of 
schizophrenia. 
 
Impaired synaptic connectivity is a predominant hypothesis of the pathology of 
schizophrenia and has been suggested by the results of human post mortem studies (64). 
However, there is insufficient information about the cellular and molecular mechanisms 
underlying this potentially impaired synaptic connectivity in schizophrenia. It is widely believed 
that the impaired synaptic connectivity between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons may 
cause network imbalance and the eventual impairment of brain function that is commonly 
observed in schizophrenic patients (4, 64-66). Here, we provide cellular and molecular evidence 
that interneuron dysfunction may be the primary cause of the overall synapse deficits associated 
with dysfunction of two genes implicated in the pathophysiology of this illness (67). If these 
suppositions are correct, it may be possible to ameliorate the impaired GABAergic synapse 
formation and the subsequent synaptic imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory signaling 
within local cortical circuits by enhancing or restoring the levels of BDNF signaling. Therefore, 
it will be exciting to evaluate the ability of BDNF “mimetic” peptides and small molecules that 
enhance BDNF translation (68, 69) in an attempt to restore inhibitory synapse function in dys-
MT mice (70).

scr or dys-shRNA and treated with or without BDNF. GFP-positive neurons were analyzed on 
DIV14 by immunofluorescence using antibodies against VGAT. Scale bar, 5 μm. (B) Summary 
graph of BDNF-mediated rescue of defects in inhibitory synapses caused by dysbindin-1 shRNA 
(scr vs dys-shRNA vs dys-shRNA+BDNF, n = 14, 23 and 15, respectively). (C–E) mIPSCs were 
recorded from DIV13–15 cortical neurons treated with or without BDNF. Shown are sample 
traces (C) cumulative plot and histograms of mIPSC frequency (D) and amplitude (E) (scr vs 
 Yuan et al.  
Page 30 of 30 
dys-shRNA vs dys-shRNA+BDNF, n = 20, 18 and 13, respectively). All histogram data were 
shown as means ± SEM. Statistical significance was assessed using Student’s t-test with the 
Bonferroni correction (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01). 
Figure 5. Dysbindin-1 knockdown reduces inhibitory synaptic transmission, which is restored by 
exogenous BDNF in ex vivo rat hippocampal organotypic slices. (A) Representative image of a 
cultured organotypic slice transfected with dys-shRNA. (B-D) mIPSCs were recorded from 
transfected neurons expressing scr, dys-shRNA or dys-shRNA+BDNF (n = 9, 12 and 12, 
respectively) in organotypic slices. Shown are sample traces (B) cumulative plot and histograms 
of mIPSC frequency (C) and amplitude (D). All histogram data were shown as means ± SEM. 
Statistical significance was assessed using Student’s t-test with the Bonferroni correction (*p < 
0.05).
