IMPORTANCE Between 1980 and 2000, the prevalence of obesity increased significantly
among adult men and women in the United States; further significant increases were
observed through 2003-2004 for men but not women. Subsequent comparisons
of data from 2003-2004 with data through 2011-2012 showed no significant increases
for men or women.
OBJECTIVE To examine obesity prevalence for 2013-2014 and trends over the decade
from 2005 through 2014 adjusting for sex, age, race/Hispanic origin, smoking status,
and education.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Analysis of data obtained from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a cross-sectional, nationally representative health
examination survey of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population that includes measured
weight and height.
EXPOSURES Survey period.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of obesity (body mass index �30) and class 3
obesity (body mass index �40).
RESULTS This report is based on data from 2638 adult men (mean age, 46.8 years) and 2817
women (mean age, 48.4 years) from the most recent 2 years (2013-2014) of NHANES and
data from 21 013 participants in previous NHANES surveys from 2005 through 2012. For the
years 2013-2014, the overall age-adjusted prevalence of obesity was 37.7% (95% CI,
35.8%-39.7%); among men, it was 35.0% (95% CI, 32.8%-37.3%); and among women, it was
40.4% (95% CI, 37.6%-43.3%). The corresponding prevalence of class 3 obesity overall was
7.7% (95% CI, 6.2%-9.3%); among men, it was 5.5% (95% CI, 4.0%-7.2%); and among
women, it was 9.9% (95% CI, 7.5%-12.3%). Analyses of changes over the decade from 2005
through 2014, adjusted for age, race/Hispanic origin, smoking status, and education, showed
significant increasing linear trends among women for overall obesity (P = .004) and for class
3 obesity (P = .01) but not among men (P = .30 for overall obesity; P = .14 for class 3 obesity).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this nationally representative survey of adults
in the United States, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity in 2013-2014 was 35.0%
among men and 40.4% among women. The corresponding values for class 3 obesity were
5.5% for men and 9.9% for women. For women, the prevalence of overall obesity and
of class 3 obesity showed significant linear trends for increase between 2005 and 2014;
there were no significant trends for men. Other studies are needed to determine the reasons
for these trends.

N
ationalhealthexaminationsurveydata,basedonmea-
sured weight and height, provide the best opportu-
nitytoestimatetheprevalenceofobesityintheUnited
States. Results from the National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES) have shown that obesity preva-
lencevariedbysex,age,andrace/Hispanicorigin.1-7Thepreva-
lence of obesity has also been shown to vary by socioeconomic
and cigarette smoking status.8,9
Previous research has included comparisons of obesity
prevalence estimates from 1999-2000 with those from
NHANES III (1988-1994),4 of 2001-2002 with 1999-2000,5 of
2003-2004 with 1999-2002,10 and of 2007-2008,3
2009-2010,1 and 2011-20127 with 2003-2004.11 Previous
NHANES data showed little change in obesity prevalence
among adults in the United States from 1960 through 1980.2
However, between NHANES II (1976-1980) and NHANES III
(1988-1994), there was a significant increase in the preva-
lence of obesity.2,6 The reasons for these and subsequent
increases are unclear. Data from NHANES 1999-2000 showed
further increases for men and women and all age groups.4
Analyses for 2001-20025 and 2003-200410 showed that these
trends continued to increase for men. For women, however,
the prevalence of obesity showed no increases between 1999
and 2004. Previous analyses of age-adjusted prevalence also
showed no significant changes from 2003-2004 through
2011-2012 for men or women.7
To get a more comprehensive understanding of the trends
in obesity in the United States over the decade from 2005
through 2014, this analysis presents new data for 2013-2014.
Age-adjusted and crude estimates of the prevalence of obesity
fromthecombined4yearsofNHANES2011-2014havebeenpre-
viously reported.12 Here we extend those observations by pro-
viding sex-specific estimates for overall obesity (body mass in-
dex [BMI] ≥30) and class 3 obesity (BMI ≥40) (BMI is calculated
asweightinkilogramsdividedbyheightinmeterssquared).13,14
In addition, we modeled the association of overall obesity and
class3obesitywithage,race/Hispanicorigin,smoking,andedu-
cation.Wealsoexaminedsex-specifictrendsfrom2005through
2014, adjusting for the same factors.
Methods
The NHANES program of the National Center for Health Statis-
tics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention includes a se-
ries of cross-sectional nationally representative health exami-
nation surveys beginning in 1960. In each survey cycle, a
nationally representative sample of the US civilian noninstitu-
tionalized population is selected using a complex, stratified,
multistage probability cluster sampling design. Beginning in
1999,NHANESbecameacontinuoussurveywithoutabreakbe-
tween cycles.11 NHANES was approved by the National Center
forHealthStatisticsResearchEthicsReviewBoard.Writtencon-
sent was obtained for all adult participants.
For all surveys, weight and height were measured in a mo-
bile examination center using standardized techniques and
equipment. BMI was rounded to 1 decimal place. For adults
aged 20 years or older, obesity was defined according to clini-
calguidelines.13,14Pregnantwomenwereexcludedfromanaly-
sis. Participant age was grouped into categories of 20 to 39
years, 40 to 59 years, and 60 years and older.
Race/Hispanic origin group was defined on the basis of
self-reported responses to specific interview questions. To
examine current prevalence, race/Hispanic origin groups
were categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
non-Hispanic Asian, Hispanic, and other. The non-Hispanic
Asian category includes predominantly individuals of
Chinese, South Asian, Filipino, Vietnamese, and Japanese ori-
gin.Non-Hispanicparticipantswhoreportedamultiracialback-
ground were categorized as other. For analyses of trends over
time, race/Hispanic origin was categorized as non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, and other.
Thesecategoriesfollowtheanalyticguidelinesforanalysesthat
include data from the 2005-2006 NHANES cycle.15
Self-reported smoking status was categorized as never-
smokers,formersmokers,andcurrentsmokers.Never-smokers
were defined as those who reported that they had not
smoked as many as 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Former
smokers were defined as those who had smoked as many as
100 cigarettes but did not smoke cigarettes currently. Cur-
rentsmokersweredefinedasthosewhoreportedthattheycur-
rently smoked cigarettes every day or some days. Self-
reported education was defined using 3 categories: less than
a high school education, high school graduate, and educa-
tion beyond high school. The sample distributions of smok-
ingstatusandeducationalcategoriesareshownbysexandsur-
vey cycle in eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3
(SAS Institute) and SUDAAN version 11.01 (RTI International).
For all surveys, sampling weights accounted for unequal
probabilities of selection (resulting from the sample design
and planned oversampling of certain subgroups) and were
adjusted for nonresponse. All analyses used the examination
sampling weights and accounted for differential probabilities
of selection and the complex sample design. Standard errors
were estimated with SUDAAN using Taylor series lineariza-
tion. Statistical significance was determined (2-sided test,
P <.05) using the Satterthwaite F statistic. Age-adjusted
estimates were adjusted by the direct method to the 2000 US
Census population using the age groups 20 to 39 years, 40 to
59 years, and 60 years and older. Confidence intervals
were estimated using the method described by Korn and
Graubard.16,17
Sex-specific logistic regression models were used to as-
sess the associations of age group, race/Hispanic origin, smok-
ing status, and education with obesity prevalence. To exam-
ine trends over a decade, data from 5 discrete 2-year cycles of
the continuous NHANES (2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-
2010, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014) survey were used. Survey
cycle was treated as a categorical variable, and obesity preva-
lence was modeled as a function of survey cycle, first adjust-
ing for age group and then with further adjustments for age
group, race/Hispanic origin, education, and smoking status.
Models initially included all 2-way interactions between the

adjustment factors, and nonsignificant interactions were
deleted from the models. Models were fit for the overall
sample with adjustment for sex and also separately for men
and women. For each model, predicted margins were calcu-
lated to show prevalence standardized to the distribution of
the model covariates within the full sample.17 Predicted mar-
gins provide prevalence estimates that are standardized to
the sample distribution of the model covariates but not to an
external standard distribution. Thus, the standardization is
specific to a given model and sample, and it is not compa-
rable between models. The predicted margins show the find-
ings of the model by adjusting the estimate from each survey
cycle to the joint distribution of all the variables in the model,
thereby allowing comparison of the estimates for different
survey cycles from a given model. Single df linear contrasts in
logistic regression models were used to test for linear and
quadratic trends across survey cycles. For women, additional
subgroup analyses of linear trends were performed sepa-
rately by age group with adjustment for race/Hispanic origin,
education, and smoking status; by race/Hispanic origin with
adjustment for age group, education, and smoking status;
and by smoking status with adjustment for age group, educa-
tion, and race/Hispanic origin.
Results
This report includes data from 5455 adults (2638 men, mean
age 46.8 years; and 2817 women, mean age 48.4 years) from
the most recent 2 years of the continuous NHANES survey
(2013-2014). The sample sizes by sex, age group, and race/
Hispanic origin are shown in Table 1. The examination re-

overall crude prevalence of obesity was 37.9% (95% CI, 36.1%-
39.8%); among men, it was 35.2% (95% CI, 33.0%-37.4%); and
among women, it was 40.5% (95% CI, 37.6%-43.4%). The over-
allage-adjustedprevalenceofobesitywas37.7%(95%CI,35.8%-

women, it was 40.4% (95% CI, 37.6%-43.3%).
The estimated prevalence of class 3 obesity in 2013-2014
overall and by sex, age group, and race/Hispanic origin is also
shown in Table 2. The overall crude prevalence of class 3 obe-
sity was 7.7% (95% CI, 6.2%-9.3%); among men, it was 5.5%
(95% CI, 4.2%-7.0%); and among women, it was 9.7% (95% CI,
7.9%-11.9%).Theoverallage-adjustedprevalenceofclass3obe-

(95% CI, 4.0%-7.2%); and among women, it was 9.9% (95% CI,
7.5%-12.3%).
Odds ratios (ORs) for logistic regression models that ad-
justed simultaneously for race/Hispanic origin, age group,
smoking status, and education for obesity and class 3 obesity
are shown in Table 3 (for overall P values for each variable see
eTable3intheSupplement).Theprevalenceofobesityin2013-
2014 among men differed significantly by race/Hispanic ori-
gin and by smoking status but not by age group or education.
The prevalence of obesity among non-Hispanic Asian men was
significantly lower than among non-Hispanic white men (OR,
0.27 [95% CI, 0.20-0.38]). Among women, the prevalence of
obesity in 2013-2014 varied significantly by age group, race/
Hispanic origin, and education but not by smoking status. The
prevalence of class 3 obesity among men did not differ by age
group, race/Hispanic origin, smoking status, or education. The
prevalenceofclass3obesityamongwomendifferedbyageand
race/Hispanic origin but not by smoking status or education.

plays selected percentiles over survey cycles. Sex-specific and
overall age-adjusted prevalence estimates for obesity and class
3 obesity by survey cycle are displayed in eTable 4 in the
Supplement. The age-adjusted overall prevalence of obesity
was 34.3% (95% CI, 31.4%-37.2%) in 2005-2006 and 37.7%
(35.8-39.7) in 2013-2014. Trend analyses for the prevalence of
obesity were performed with adjustments for age group, sex,
race/Hispanic origin, smoking status, and education. The ORs
and predicted margins (standardized prevalence values) from
these models are shown in Table 4. Predicted margins show
the predicted prevalence by survey cycle (based on the model
coefficients and standardized to the distribution of the model
covariates within the combined analytic sample).17
In the model adjusted only for sex and age group, there
was a significant positive linear trend by survey cycle (P = .04)
but not a significant quadratic trend (P = .32). In sex-specific

significant 2-way interactions, the overall model showed a sig-
nificant positive linear trend (P = .02) but no significant qua-
dratictrend(P = .27).Insex-specificmodelsformen,therewas
no significant linear trend (P = .30) or quadratic trend (P = .95).
For women, however, there was a significant positive linear
trend (P = .004) and a significant positive quadratic trend
(P = .048).
Similar analyses were performed for class 3 obesity
(Table 5). In models that included only age group, there was a
significantlineartrendoverall(P = .02)andforwomen(P = .03)
but not for men (P = .17). For models that were additionally ad-
justed for age group, race/Hispanic origin, smoking status, and
education, there was a significant linear trend overall (P = .01)
and for women (P = .01) but not for men (P = .14).
Limited subgroup analyses were performed to further in-
vestigate the trends in obesity among women by stratifying
separately for age group, smoking status, or race/Hispanic ori-
gin. Adjusting for age group, education, and smoking status,
there were significant positive linear trends among non-
Hispanic white women (P = .03), non-Hispanic black women
(P = .008), and Mexican American women (P = .03). Adjust-
ing for race/Hispanic origin, educational status, and smoking
status, there were significant positive linear trends for the age
group 20 to 39 years (P = .02) and also for 60 years and older
(P = .03) but not for the age group 40 to 59 years (P = .20). Ad-

were significant positive linear trends for never smokers
(P = .03) and for current smokers (P = .01) but not for former
smokers (P = .41). Because of the limitations of subgroup
analyses,20,21 these results should be interpreted cautiously.
Discussion
For the years 2013-2014, the unadjusted prevalence of obesity
was 35.2% among men and 40.5% among women. Analyses of
data from 2013-2014 found that for both sexes, obesity preva-
lence varied by race/Hispanic origin. For men, obesity preva-
lencealsovariedbysmokingstatus,withtheprevalenceofobe-
sity significantly lower among current smokers than among
never smokers. For women, there were no significant differ-
encesbysmokingstatus,butthosewitheducationbeyondhigh
school were significantly less likely to be obese.
Inthepresentanalyses,weexaminedtrendsinobesityover
a decade, beginning with NHANES 2005-2006, and we found
no significant effect of survey cycle on the prevalence of obe-
sity among men after adjusting for age group. However, there
was a statistically significant positive linear trend in obesity
prevalencewithsurveycycleduringthisdecadeamongwomen
and after adjustments for age group, race/Hispanic origin, edu-
cation, and smoking status, there was also a statistically sig-
nificant quadratic trend. Thus it does not appear that changes
in the distribution of these factors explain these trends in obe-
sity prevalence. The increase in obesity prevalence, relative to
2005-2006, was statistically significant in the 2013-2014 data
for women. Statistically significant linear trends in the preva-
lence of class 3 obesity were found for women but not for men
after adjustments for age group, race/Hispanic origin, educa-
tion, and smoking status.
There are several limitations to this study. The definition
of obesity used here is based on weight and height and not on
measurements of body fatness. Although BMI and body fat-
ness are highly correlated,22 the trends observed in BMI may
notcompletelyparalleltrendsinbodyfatnessorinhealthrisks.
Body fatness at a given BMI may vary by sex, age group, and
race-ethnicity.23 Health risk at a given BMI may also vary by
these factors.24-26 Thus use of different BMI cutoff values for
the definitions of risk in Asian populations were recom-
mended in an expert consultation from the World Health
Organization.26 Sample estimates are weighted to reflect

the US population at a given time, but demographic changes
in the population beyond those included in the models could
affect the observed trends. Differential sampling error
mayaffectcomparisonsovertimebecauseeachtimepointrep-
resents data from a different cross-sectional sample.
Although there has been considerable speculation about
the causes of the increases in obesity prevalence, data are lack-
ing to show the causes of these trends, which have been ob-
served in numerous other countries in addition to the United
States. Similarly, there are few data to indicate reasons that
these trends might accelerate, stop, or slow. A slowing of in-
creases in obesity prevalence has been observed in other
countries27 and among children as well as adults.28,29 Histori-
cally, increases in body weight have occurred over a rela-
tively long time period, but these increases do not necessar-
ily follow a predictable trajectory.30 The significant quadratic
trend seen in the present data suggest a recent increase in obe-
sity among women, in contrast to the previous findings of no
significant increases since 2003-2004.
Anumberofstudieshaveattemptedtoexaminepasttrends
in obesity and make extrapolations to the future for the United
States,31-33 Canada,34,35 Australia,36 the United Kingdom,37
European populations,38 and globally.39 However, the results
presented here suggest that attempts to extrapolate from past
data to possible future trends in obesity prevalence may not
provide valid estimates. These attempts are difficult to vali-
date because many of them make projections for the distant
future, and even relatively short-term forecasts are not nec-
essarily high in accuracy. Rokholm et al40 have reviewed the
evidence for leveling off in obesity prevalence. Presumably
time itself is not the explanatory factor but some other char-
acteristics that might also change with time; however, there
is little known about what those characteristics might be.
Conclusions
In this nationally representative survey of adults in the
United States, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity in 2013-
2014 was 35.0% among men and 40.4% among women. The
corresponding values for class 3 obesity were 5.5% for men
and 9.9% for women. For women, the prevalence of overall
and class 3 obesity both showed a significant linear trend
between 2005 and 2014; there were no significant trends for
men. Other studies are needed to determine the reasons
for these trends.
