Executive Summary 
 
Thank you for agreeing to participate in the SPIRIT-PRO Consensus meeting on 11th/12th May 2017 at the University of Birmingham, UK; your input is invaluable.   
 
Meeting Aims:  
 
 The primary aim of the meeting is to reach consensus on which items should be included in patient-reported outcome (PRO) specific guidance for protocol writers; an official 
SPIRIT-PRO extension.   
 
 The secondary aim is to produce preliminary recommendations about the inclusion of PRO information in documents that complement the protocol, e.g. guidance/training for 
trial staff, information/guidance for study participants, statistical analysis plans, etc.  
 
For the primary aim, items may be included in the guidance as a SPIRIT-PRO extension or an elaboration.  We propose that the SPIRIT-PRO Extensions or SPIRIT Elaborations 
will apply to randomised clinical trials where PROs are a primary or key secondary outcome as defined below: 
Definitions: 
 
SPIRIT: Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials 
SPIRIT PRO Extension: An additional checklist item describing PRO protocol content to address an aspect of PRO assessment that is not adequately covered by SPIRIT, as 
judged by available evidence and expert opinion. 
SPIRIT Elaboration: An elaboration of an existing SPIRIT item as applied to a specific context; in this instance, as applied to randomised controlled trials assessing PROs 
Primary Outcome/ Endpoint 
The most important outcome in a trial, providing the most clinically relevant evidence directly related to the primary objective of the trial. 
  
Secondary Outcomes / Endpoint(s) 
These are outcomes pre-specified in the protocol to assess additional effects of the intervention. Some PROs may be identified as important or key secondary outcomes. 
  
‘Important’ or ‘Key’ Secondary Patient-Reported Outcomes / Endpoints 
Some PRO measures (particularly health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures) are multidimensional, producing several domain-specific outcome scales, e.g. pain, fatigue, 
physical function, psychological distress. For any particular trial, it is likely that a particular PRO or PRO domain(s) will be more relevant than others, reflecting the expected 
effect(s) of the trial intervention(s) in the target patient population. These relevant PRO(s) and/or domain(s) may additionally constitute the important or key secondary PROs 
(identified a priori and specified as such in the trial protocol and statistical analysis plan) and will be the focus of hypothesis testing. In a regulatory environment, these 
outcomes may support a labelling claim. Because these outcomes are linked with hypotheses (see CONSORT PRO Extension 2b), they may be subject to P value adjustment 
(or ‘alpha-spending’). Note: PROs may not only provide evidence of efficacy/effectiveness but may also be intended to capture and provide evidence of safety and tolerability 
(e.g. PRO-CTCAE).

Information about voting during the SPIRIT-PRO Consensus Meeting 
 
RE Primary Aim: to reach consensus on which items should be included in the SPIRIT-PRO extension 
 
Voting options: we propose that for each item we consider the following voting options: 
1. Include as a SPIRIT-PRO extension item (or elaboration where indicated)   
2. Exclude 
3. Further discussion required. 
 
Voting at the meeting will be informed by several pieces of evidence/information: 
1. Whether the item in question was supported for inclusion in the Delphi and Stakeholder Survey (appendix 1)  
2. Whether the item was adjudged by the SPIRIT-PRO Operations Group (MC, DK, RMB, AS, MK) as captured by the existing SPIRIT guidance (appendix 2).  
3. How well the item is currently addressed in clinical trial protocols based on evidence from our systematic review of NIHR HTA protocols1 and confidential preliminary results 
from the EPiC study2. 
4. Other key pieces of supportive evidence identified by the SPIRIT-PRO Operations Team. 
 
The above evidence/information is summarised in Table 1. We have made a recommendation for each item based on this information and using the following decision 
rules (also outlined in Fig. 1).   
 
 Recommendations for a SPIRIT-PRO Extension were based on the following criteria: 
 
 ≥70% of round 2 Delphi participants scored the proposed item as ‘critical’ (7-9) for inclusion in a trial protocol, whilst ≤15% scored the item as not important (1-3) 
[where PROs are included in a trial as a primary outcome].*  
 
AND 
 
 The item was adjudged by the Operations Group as either:  
(A) not captured by the existing SPIRIT guidance, OR  
(B) only partially captured by SPIRIT with important detail omitted and rarely/inconsistently addressed in practice (based on evidence from our HTA/EPiC review 
of trial protocols, note: we interpreted ‘rarely’ as <30% of protocols including item details and ‘inconsistently’ as between 31% and 70% inclusion). 
 
 
 
 Recommendations for a SPIRIT-PRO Elaboration were based on the following criteria: 
 
  ≥70% of round 2 Delphi participants scored the proposed item as ‘critical’ (7-9) for inclusion in a trial protocol, whilst ≤15% scored the item as not important (1-3) 
[where PROs are included in a trial as a primary outcome].*  
 
AND 
 
 The item was adjudged by the operation team as: (C) covered by SPIRIT but rarely/inconsistently addressed in practice.

Inclusion of PRO Information in clinical trial protocols: key studies 
 
There follows a brief summary of the key evidence the SPIRIT-PRO Operations Group drew upon when attempting to determine whether each of the candidate SPIRIT-
PRO items was routinely addressed in clinical trial protocols.  
 
EPiC Study (nearing completion, intended submission for publication July 2017)  
 
Aim: to evaluate the standards of PRO-specific content in NIHR portfolio cancer trial protocols and their arising publications (completed studies between 2001 and 2014, 
all cancer specialties/age groups). The NIHR portfolio includes UK-led international/national trials, supported by a range of funders, adjudged as high-quality clinical 
research studies.  
 
Methods: two independent investigators screened the portfolio trial database, retrieved the most up-to-date trial protocol (final ethically approved version) and arising 
publications for review, extracted demographic trial data, and reviewed: (i) the general quality/completeness of protocols/publications using the SPIRIT and CONSORT 
checklists respectively; and (ii) the PRO-specific aspects using a PRO protocol checklist and the CONSORT-PRO Extension. 
 
Preliminary Results (Confidential): n=251 trials were included and n=106 protocols and n=157 publications were sourced. Preliminary data based on n=79 protocols 
matched to their corresponding publication(s) suggests general protocol quality/completeness was above average (adjusted mean SPIRIT score (max 50) = 30.96 
(64.65%)), but PRO-specific content was frequently omitted (adjusted mean PRO protocol checklist score (max 33) = 9.96 (31.53%)). A similar picture was seen across 
the included trial publications (adjusted mean CONSORT score (max 37) = 23.43 (66.17%); adjusted mean CONSORT PRO score (max 14) = 3.14 (23.92%)). 
Worryingly, n=36 of 98 (36.7%) trials we have reviewed thus far failed to report PRO results in either a primary or secondary publication, meaning that 26,057 
participants provided QoL data that was not subsequently made available to future patients.  
 
HTA Study (Published in PLOS One in 2013, link to manuscript here) 
 
Aim: to evaluate the PRO content of n=75 clinical trial protocols drawn from the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) 
programme (2012/13). The sample represented a broad range of clinical areas.  
 
Methods: as per EPiC, but wholly focused on reviewing the general quality/completeness of protocols only using SPIRIT and the PRO protocol checklist. 
 
Results: protocols included a mean of 63% SPIRIT recommendations and 33% PRO protocol checklist items. PRO protocol content was not associated with general 
protocol completeness; thus, protocols judged as relatively ‘complete’ using SPIRIT were still likely to have omitted a large proportion of PRO checklist items.  
 
 
 
Note: EPIC and HTA studies used the same 33-item PRO protocol checklist (the precursor to SPIRIT-PRO) to judge the completeness of the PRO components of the included protocols. This 
checklist was developed in 2013, following a systematic review of PRO guidance for protocol developers published in PLOS One: link to manuscript. Where possible we have extracted item level 
data from both the EPiC and HTA studies into the summary table appearing in this document, however, the 33-item checklist does not map directly to all 56 candidate SPIRIT-PRO items meaning 
there are some missing data fields. For transparency, we have highlighted these in the table using a dash.

RE Secondary aim: Additional voting on PRO content of other trial documentation 
 
Based on the Round 2 Delphi survey we have also highlighted where ≥50% of respondents recommended including PRO information in additional trial guidance e.g. 
Guidance/training for trial staff; Information/guidance for study participants; Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP); etc.  
 
As part of the consensus meeting, attendees will be asked to vote on these suggestions to value-add to the meeting outputs in terms of recommendations for additional trial 
guidance about trial conduct and analysis to complement the trial protocol. It is our hope that a suitable suite of PRO-specific trial guidance will facilitate high-quality PRO evidence. 
 
 
 
Final Thoughts 
We would appreciate it if you would please review the table below prior to the meeting, as this will streamline the voting process on the day.  Please note that since conducting 
Round 2 of the Delphi, we have merged and/or reworded some items based on respondent feedback. Where two or more items have been merged, we have reported the % of 
respondents who endorsed each item, if at least one of these items was endorsed by ≥50% or respondents.  
If you have any questions regarding the process or information provided please get in touch. 
We look forward to seeing you at the meeting. 
Kind Regards
